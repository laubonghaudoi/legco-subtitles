140
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:42,360
年紀大呀，或者比較之身嘅唔再船啦，咁其實

141
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:48,880
會計即係新多啲新啦，會唔會反而嗱啲可能之

142
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:57,800
個經會唔會有即係擔心咁樣第二就係即係話即

143
00:12:48,880 --> 00:13:04,320
係因為咁就唔再時候角色唔係講自從外其實社

144
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:08,920
會關心我事下成。嗱，其實就第一樣嘢啦，我

145
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:15,240
答理條先啦，其實我哋第街立化見到我哋通一

146

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:30,040
立法工作，咁所以我覺得咧就係唔系好唔好，

149
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:33,880

150
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,160
工作呢？我係嚟講一重要嘅。呀我亦都講咗好

151
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:42,639

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:47,199
光後浪吹前朗嚇呢個係律嚟嘅，朝起退，亦都

153
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:53,759
係律嚟嘅，雖然我哋有三幾位已決定唔同原因

154
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:59,839
呢，係唔再去第八屆嘅議會，但係我亦都有足

155
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:05,040
夠嘅經驗嘅議員喺度呢會帶領下一屆嘅議會。

156

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:16,759
60 個呢都係新丁嘅，我哋都能夠做得咁好，咁

159
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:19,320
我覺得第八屆議會用呢個水平嚟講呢，一定做

160
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,320
得會更好。

161
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
你

162
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,600
har 中 diversity

163
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,600
race

164
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,440
and my second

165
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,839
for function constituency candidates the

166
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
law requir they have a substantial

167
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,519
connection to that constituency if

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,440

lease

172
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:01,120

173
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,680
that it's up To

174
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,360
