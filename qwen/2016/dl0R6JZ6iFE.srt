話咧，誒。

51
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,690
咁先請啊！

52
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,680
因為除咗呢個以前項目之外咧。

53
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,190
然後咧，我會請律政司司長袁國強資深法律師發言。

香港律師會會長洪雲信律師咧簡介香港律師會舉辦嘅統一執業試。

55
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,870
咁至於嗰份試卷裏邊嘅其他題目咧，其實誒三間大學係可以。

56
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:41,670
再擺入去都得嘅，即係譬如話，我假設係conference咁先算啦，即係嗱樓房買賣噉啊。

57
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:08,450
有嘅考試裏邊嘅某一啲誒誒，律師會覺得係主要嘅科目。

58
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:23,110
咁最後咧，我會請香港大律師公會陳景生資深大律師咧，同埋各團體嘅代表咧，係逐一發言嘅。

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:36,380

60
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:53,540
就係誒，我哋係仲有另外一個議程嘅，所以我就要求大家就好好掌握即係發言嘅時間。噉就發言時間咧，就大律師公會同埋每個團體發言嘅時間咧係三分鐘。

61
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:26,440
咁咧就誒畀律師會，咁咧就喺嗰個科目入邊咧就定一啲考試嘅題目，咁嗰啲題目咧就係誒學生必答同埋必須要誒誒pass嘅，誒必須要合格嘅。

62
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:18,480
先請阿洪會長嚇簡介你哋嗰個香港律師會建議嗰個舉辦嘅統一執業試嚇。多謝主席。嗯，好簡單嚟講咧，就誒，其實呢個執業試咧，統一執業試咧，誒並唔需要係一個實體嚟嘅，誒即係。

63
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:40,060
原本嘅構思咧就係，如果我哋未能夠同三間法律學院達成共識嘅話咧，噉就誒啲學生誒即係讀完PCL啲學生咧就需要考誒律師會嘅一個試。咁誒，但我好高興向主席。

64
00:08:40,060 --> 00:09:00,070
彙報咧就係誒，而家似乎三間大學同香港律師會咧都誒有一個共識嘅。呢個共識咧就係我哋唔希望啲學生需要考兩個試嘅。咁為咗避免啲學生考兩個試咧，誒香港律師會提議咧就或者喺現

65
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,190
什麼選擇？

66
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,320
咁誒？

67
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,170
提交呢個誒誒提議咧，啊，我都係誒。

68
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,420
誒大致上個方向係啱嘅嗱，因為咧大學誒。

69
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,270
方面嘅誒考試啊，誒誒或者提供啲咩科目嘅，啊咁誒。

70
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:49,750
啊，咁誒，除非主席需要我誒喺就翻某一點度補充，噉我諗誒。

71
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:39,500
其他啲細節嘅誒誒主席，我相信誒呢個委員會都已經收到律師會嘅一個誒。

72
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:13,800
叫做咩啊？佢話possible model of commonly recognised assessments係有啲咩唔同嘅？有冇唔同嘅？誒，我覺得我其實覺得誒。

73
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:49,180
係各方向啱嘅，即係我哋其實都係講緊差唔多嘅嘢，可能咧就即係嗰個演繹嘅方法有啲唔同。係明白，好，誒律政司司長。

74
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:57,870
記唔起啦，咁咧就誒先由佢哋去討論嘅。咁然後咧誒誒，佢哋呢個誒小組咧就會作出一啲誒誒。

75
00:10:50,030 --> 00:11:02,810
我嘅時間係差唔多嘅啦。係，我想問一問就係誒，即係大家想各位大家都清楚咧，就係你正話所提嗰個建議咧，同呢個係個大學提出嗰個。

76
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:17,540
即係睇法啦，咁然後咧就會交翻由個Standing Committee on Standard and Development嘅，咁呢個誒Standing Committee睇完之後咧，就需要畀Loserside嘅Council去endorse嘅，咁即係話咧，我哋程序上咧係要。

77
00:09:41,950 --> 00:10:01,960
咁除咗律師會嗰一條或者兩條嘅題目，咁可能平時一般都有五條嘅。咁另外剩翻落嚟嗰啲，咪由翻啲大學自己去決定啦。嚇咁誒，關於選科方面咧，香港律師會係唔唔想幹預三間大學喺electives喺選科嗰嗰方。

78
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:28,560
我覺得，如果我哋係誒能夠落成呢個噉嘅構思嘅話咧，誒其實係喺一定程度上已經滿足到誒律師會誒而家我哋希望推行嘅所謂誒統一執業事師呢個概念㗎啦。

79
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:45,460
冇幾日之前睇到噉，同埋因為我係出咗門噉，我喺呢度。不如我講一講我哋律師會嗰個誒運作嘅方法咧，就係任何嘅提議咧，我哋一定會考慮嘅。但係係點樣做咧？首先咧，就要就要由我哋嘅Legal Education Committee。唔好意思，個中文突然之間。

80
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:38,260
高乎三三個誒委員會或者小組嘅，咁所以誒誒就翻大學誒誒剛剛提出嚟嗰啲噉嘅意見咧，啊我係即係今日一定唔會有有啲乜嘢誒誒答案嘅，但係我相我我我我係我感覺上係個。

81
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,580
嗯。

82
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,590
唔該，市長。

83
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,120
啊，陳景生資深大律師。

84
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,840
我係同意律政司司長頭先講嘅嘢嘅。

85
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:39,140
內香港法律教育同埋培訓嘅整體嘅情況，噉啊？

86
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,110
大約係十月左右咧，係向呢個常委會咧係提交呢一個檢討報告嘅。

87
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:10,910
年度開啓典禮嘅時候指出，我哋嘅立場係法律教育同埋培訓嘅任何改革咧，必須係以公眾利益為最終嘅依歸。多謝主席。

88
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:45,230
萬咧係以便常委會咧去聘用顧問進行呢一項嘅檢討研究嘅，而呢一項檢討研究咧，據我哋理解咧，亦都係包括而家律師會希望引入嘅統一嘅執業嘅考試。

89
00:12:49,490 --> 00:13:09,500
多謝主席。啊，喺我哋嚟講咧，法律教育包括係法律專業教育咧，對法律服務甚或整個法治嘅發展咧，係有好重要嘅影響。因此，我哋律政司一直係非常重視法律教育嘅發展，亦都一直係支持香港法律教育及培訓上設委員會。

90
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:29,510
以下簡稱常會嘅工作，響二零一三年嘅十二月十八號咧，常會決定係就香港嘅法律教育同埋培訓係展開全面嘅檢討。律政司係支持呢一個決定，亦都響二零一五年嘅三月咧係提供咗一百五十。

91
00:13:45,510 --> 00:14:05,520
據我哋理解咧，顧問將會係喺本月底，即係四月三十號之前咧，係提交呢個檢討嘅進度報告。而顧問咧，亦都係計劃咧，係喺本年嘅七月三十一號之前咧，係完成呢一個檢討嘅工作。喺十。

92
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:32,590
鑑於今次嘅事件，我哋認為係影響係重大，所以律政司認為咧，應該除咗從兩個法律嘅專業團體、大學同埋學生嘅角度去考慮呢個問題嘅時候之外咧，亦都必須係從一個比較宏觀嘅角度去出發考慮。

93
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:59,430
律政司亦都留意到，就係律誒律師會就今次嘅會議提交嘅文件，即係四月十九號嘅文件裏邊咧，第六段係指事件仍然咧係響發展嘅階段嘅。原文係話the matter is still in stage of development。而律師會亦都係同各相關嘅大學咧係進行。

94
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:19,440
緊商討，既然誒律師會仍然係同相關嘅大學係進行緊商討，而常委會進行嘅檢討咧，將會響本年嘅十月完成報告嘅話咧，我哋律政司希望各個嘅持份者，包括係律師會、大律師公會同埋相關嘅大學咧。

95
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:39,450
響商討呢一個統一考試呢一個議題嘅時候咧，會係預留時間同埋空間去考慮常會會將會發表嘅檢討報告。而律政司認為呢一個嘅處理方法咧係比較合適，我哋亦都相信咧係唔會影響整件。

96
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:59,460
事嘅進度嘅，響有機會研究常委會提交嘅檢討報告之前咧，我哋對誒統一考試嘅建議係保持一個開放嘅態度，但係希望各持份者咧都係以公眾利益咧為首要嘅考慮。正如我今年一月響法。

97
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,620
Michael。

98
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,370
你講一。

99
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,680
噉就。

100
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,450
我哋就會再表達。

101
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,240
Thank you, chairman. Yeah, very happy to be here.

102
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,080
發表咗一個兩份嘅公開嘅言論咧，係有所改變。

103
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,980
喺呢個C.E.E.呢個問題嗰度咧，大律師公會咧就係想提出有以下嘅意見。

104
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,320
咁呢樣嘢咧，佢個律師會嘅絕嘅改變嘅態度咧，係值得我哋大律師公會歡迎嘅。

105
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:49,120
而家先請香港大學法律學院嘅何耀明院長啊，先發表嘅意見。

106
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:34,570
我亦都好高興，今日聽到第一次正正式式聽到，雖然即係街街上嘅傳聞啊嗰啲唔計啦，就律師會今日採取嘅態度咧，同佢。

107
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:53,300
仲有一點咧，我要提出嘅咧就係誒，因為而家PCLL咧係一個共同嘅qualifying exam嚟嘅，係大律師同埋律師都大家都係要經過嗰樣考試。

108
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:40,300
咁但係律師會而家呢個建議咧係比較係容易接受啲，但係我哋覺得咧喺呢一方面咧，我哋都應該聽到法律改革委員會個報告同埋佢哋嘅意見咧，我哋先再考慮。

109
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:25,880
因為你無論你就算佢所有人考同樣一個試都好啦，有人考得好啲，有人考得衰啲，有人答題目係答一至五題，有人係答六至十題，咁所以咧，你唔可以話測試嘅嘢永遠係一樣嘅。

110
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:11,130
第一個咧就係其實咧係冇可能話會有一個制度有一個試咧係可以完全整到話每一個法律行業嘅入行嗰個人咧要考嘅試係一樣嘅程度係一樣嘅呢樣嘢係差唔多係冇可能嘅。

111
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,060
好。

112
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,900
oh，excuse me。

113
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,070
BCLL as a

114
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,360
Fully comprehensively represented by all the stakeholders.

115
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:12,340
一 unified structure， which I think we need to be careful can go forward in in the future.

116
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:58,650
下一位係請呢個香港中文大學法律學院嘅誒Christopher院長。

117
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:08,820
我認為呢個PCLL系統喺香港係一個最精緻嘅系統，嘅研究生實習。

118
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:46,920
The law schools are willing to to to investigate and to develop with the with the law society, and we're glad to hear that the law society is also willing to do that. Thank you.

119
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:36,490
所以，the the proposal that we make yeah is which was discussed and agreed upon by all the three law schools yeah is is is something that

120
00:19:49,280 --> 00:20:01,450
may well be able to find a common ground. The submission that we we we put in is the same submission that we've given to the to the panel of the Standing Committee of Legal Education and Training.

121
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:13,590
咁所以如果喺嗰個司入邊有咩改進啊，有咩改變咧，大律師咧，公會咧亦都係好有，即係好想參與，好想知道啊，究竟有咩改革？但係暫時嚟講咧，因為律師公會嘅反對，以我所知咧，佢哋而家同大學傾嘅點樣做咧，係大律。

122
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:33,600
施工會係冇參與嘅，咁喺呢方面咧係唔係十分理想。但係我哋都唔介意，即係例如好似佢哋傾咗一個結果出嚟嘅時候咧，我哋相信咧大學方面啊都會有機會同大利施工會傾。咁當時啊喺到時嘅時候咧，有咩嘢我哋又再咩嘢詳細嘅意見咧？

123
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:29,110
and I think any changes that we we want to do to it have to be very carefully considered because we already have an extremely good product here. the the other consideration is the the students here, they have to take they already have to take so many exams here. and I think a priority should be that we should not

124
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:49,120
burden them with another set of examinations if we can help it. So it is in that in that spirit that we we very happy to to to negotiate with the or to talk to the the law society and very happy that it looks as as if we may we.

125
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:21,740
and this is the the panel mentioned by the secretary of justice, and so we are hoping that the that is should be the main body which considers any any major changes that are to be made to the PCCL or anything that has to do with legal education in Hong Kong, because that body is is very

126
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,060
係。

127
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,450
Thank you very much.

128
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,850
Thank you.

129
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
thank you, chair.

130
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,590
嗯。

131
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,460
Professor Lin。

132
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,860
of the CEE.

133
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,750
係一位誒香港城市大學法律學院嘅林峯教授副院長。

134
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:35,390
Thank you, Chairman. I just want to make three brief points on this issue. Firstly, I'd like to echo what S.J. and Edward Chan see.

135
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:58,140
第三點我 want to make is any CEE should maintain the quality level of the PCOL, the autonomy of the university, and the public interest should be the ultimate consideration.

136
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:13,510
Finally, and again echoing what my colleague Michael Hor has said, we need to be sure that we bear very much in mind not just our interests as legal educators and our interests as legal professionals, but the interests of our students as well. Thank you.

137
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:23,250
主席，我會比較簡短，因為我認為三所法學係就與法律界討論的立場是真正共識，這是非常有用的，因為我們有共同的基礎來討論。

138
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:43,260
我有一直在這些討論中説，我相信前進的路徑是開放和持續的對話，之間法律學校和法律社會。我會想，然而，重複，什麼Edward Chan説，有大價值，的。

139
00:21:45,350 --> 00:22:05,360
實用訓練 program，但係有更值的價值，係因為它提供一個統一的實用訓練 program，係可以提供給那些年輕人有志於成為律師入行，或者成為大律師的，而這個 program 就是。

140
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:32,720
again, like everyone else, I think that we need to be sure that whatever comes out of these discussions is not, in the end, inconsistent with anything that is likely to come from the standing committee's own review. It would be difficult to imagine that a review of that kind is not going to come up with some.

141
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:52,920
重要 considerations regarding, for example, the distribution of subject matter between the law degree and the PCLL. And if that were to be the case, then we would need to make sure that whatever comes out of discussions with the law society is not inconsistent with those conclusions.

142
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:55,680
have said that is the standing committee seems to be the better venue for the whole discussion of this issue because it has the overweening power and it's still in the process of finalising its review report of legal education in Hong Kong.

143
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,920
唔該。

144
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,740
陳泳怡小姐。

145
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,280
第三 concern we have is over the time of implementation of CEE.

146
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,800
下一位係誒香港大學學生會法律學會嘅主席。

147
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,680
應具備等同的權力在設定和標記紙張。我期望律師公會能在實施CEE考試前，處理上述的疑慮。謝謝。

148
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:46,690
Programs are five years long. We believe that students should be informed of the examination before entering into law school, as the implementation of CEE should not be retrospective.

149
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:58,530
所以，我認為CEE應該不應實施於2022年。它會被感激如果拉薩蒂可以釋出一個確認時間表，盡快。

150
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:32,880
If this is what the law society accepts, that means the relevant provision is subsection A2, and under which passing PCL is not required at all.

151
00:25:47,320 --> 00:26:00,790
Examination is relevant to subsection A1. One will need to pass all PCLL core subjects as well as the PCLL examination as a whole in order to enter into a trainee solicitor contract.

152
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:26,960
主席，，我代表法律學生從香港大學，我會提一些我們對入學考試的關注，以及法律協會，以及司法行政委員會的委員會。

153
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:49,330
although passing all core subjects, all core subject questions set by the law society while failing the PCLL exam as a whole is a rare situation. still, we would like to clarify how will the law society handle this situation in case it happens.

154
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:16,670
The second point I want to make is, as from the law society's submission and also what the president Hong has said now to this panel, that the CEE can be a sort of virtual exam and which will be part of the existing.

155
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:36,680
PCL program， and that is exactly the position we proposed in our submission to this panel last year. So we welcome that position， and we are actually working， as President Hong has said， closely between the law society and the three law schools about the detail.

156
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:47,320
第一個 concern 我們有係 whether the examination will fall under subsection A1 or A2 of the trainee solicitors rules. 我們 understand that presently the law society agrees to conduct a centralised assessment on core subjects of PCLA programmes. In this case, if the

157
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:21,080
however， in a meeting that I that my association had with the law society on 11th of April this year， we were told that the law society will allow a PCL student who passes all the questions set by the law society， but failing the PCL exam as a whole to enter into a training solicitor contract。

158
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,330
and secondly.

159
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,100
啊！最後一位係香港城市大學。

160
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,300
The Law Society to also address this.

161
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,730
學生會嘅會長陳善遠女士。

162
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,710
未能夠評論，但係我哋希望律師會能夠將我哋以下呢三點嘅意見考慮。

163
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:36,930
下一位，我哋請誒香港中文大學學生會誒會長範延章先生。

164
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:58,790
好，請講。誒，主席你好，誒，多謝主席。首先，誒，誒，我係香港城市大學學生會第二十七屆法律學科聯會嘅評議會主席及誒處理幹事會會長，誒。

165
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:47,360
Thank you, Chairman. Actually, I'm the former president of the Law Student Society. Today, our acting president Maxwell Chan would be addressing the issues mainly about the CE exam.

166
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:26,380
但我們非常 grateful  that the Law Society has taken a more close approach with the universities, and we look forward to hearing what the Standing Committee of Legal Education has to say before any further discussions are made. Thank you.

167
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:52,930
Thank you, Chairman. I'm here today to submit the views of the Undergraduate Law Society of the Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and I would like to stress that my comments are restricted to the students of the undergraduate programme and not to other people that may be affected, such as the Juris Doctor.

168
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:29,510
There is a possibility that these students will in turn clash with the date of the Law Society CEE, and we hope that the Law Society will address this issue and will guarantee that those students will be, from this retrospective view, not be affected by the exam and the implementations of it.

169
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:49,650
我們理解，律師公會是實施這些變更，因為他們擔心關於三所法律學院內的不一致，我們很高興他們採取一個不同的方法，即與學院合作，並在PCLL文件內實施他們的問題。然而，我們也想討論這個。

170
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:11,730
所以，一個主要的Concerns，which Winnie had already addressed， is the fact that the CEE is scheduled to be implemented not before the year of 2021， and because of the fact that some of the students are taking double degrees or may choose to defer a year or extend their studies through going to exchange programmes。

171
00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:09,730
和第二個 concern 我們有係關於難度的 CEE 問題。我們想知道，如果可能的話，對於評估 CEE 問題的 panel，能否發放範本供學生參考，以便第一組考生在進入考試場時能夠更有心理準備。

172
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:35,570
律師會提到，CE會被實施，不早於2021。我會想引導您的注意到，如果CEE要實施於2021，所有現時第一年雙學位學生都會受影響，因為這些雙學位。

173
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:18,900
Our final concern is over the power of law society. In section ten of the law society's submission, it is mentioned that the law society would set questions, mark the scripts and has the final say on the final mark of each answer to CE questions. However, I believe that the law faculties of the three universities.

174
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,920
好。

175
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,920
好，唔該。

176
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,600
噉就誒。

177
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,580
先請啊副主席。

178
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,460
而家就係誒委員提問嘅時間。

179
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,360
知道或者未來學生知道，我哋亦都非常歡迎進一步討論。誒，喺呢個。

180
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:22,930
噉就我就暫時有三三有四位嘅，啊五位嘅。

181
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:34,820
由於時間有限咧，我建議會喺委員嘅提問時間咧係連答連問咧係四分鐘。

182
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:11,060
檢討報告或者草稿喺十月或者十一月公佈嘅時候，我哋再嚟誒收集收集學生意見同埋同大家討論。多謝主席。唔該。

183
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:16,550
相誒，但係我哋希望誒能夠喺檢討報告公佈之後先再作進一步討論。但相信在座各位都記得同埋相信法律界一直捍衞嘅係香港最核心嘅價值，就係。

184
00:29:49,930 --> 00:30:09,940
although it may solve the inconsistencies between the three law schools, there may be inconsistency between the two legal professions now, since the Law Society is implementing their questions on the core papers, and so in turn this will affect both streams of law. And while the bar association has no input in this, so we would like to.

185
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:19,310
誒首先啊，我哋收集喺誒收集學法律學生嘅意見都只係限於誒法學士課程啦，而誒而對於統一執業試嘅誒爭議咧，我哋大誒希望提出三點意見啦。但係誒由於時間同長程內容等等都未有誒確實嘅誒資料，我哋都未。

186
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:44,260
首先第一點係誒利益衝突，誒香港律誒香港律師會作為誒執業律師誒執執業執業事務律師嘅代表機構，誒無疑誒無疑喺出卷或者審核方面能夠決定誒進入該行業嘅學生係誒會引起我哋學生嘅憂慮啦。而第二點就係考試壓力，誒眾所周知。

187
00:31:44,260 --> 00:32:04,270
啲誒P.C.L.L嘅工作量已經本身非常非常繁重，再加如果再喺呢個基礎上加上一個考試，無疑係令誒學生百上加斤。而呢個亦都係我哋作為學生代表最關心嘅一點。而第三點就係周長嘅考慮。誒顧問小組檢討報告尚未公佈，但係誒。

188
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:37,120
法治而司好好大程度上可以控制好大部分嘅法律界人才嘅質素喺未來。而目前我哋見到法律界人才仔仔，可見舊有制度其實行之有效，而亦都見唔到有任何重大問題要令到我哋急於求變。因此喺考慮上三點，我哋希望。

189
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:57,130
法律界嘅無論呢個C.E考試，唔單止係影響到法律界各方面嘅持份者，又或者僅僅係法律係學生嘅前途，而係誒香港大公香港市民嘅利益。所以就住課程內容同埋能否有誒樣本試卷等等嘅資料，我哋希望律師會可以盡快畀我哋誒學生。

190
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:58,050
主席，我 glad to see that all the parties are coming together to try to work out a solution, because I think this process remind us that as members of the legal profession, none of us could unilaterally do anything without consulting each other. It is important that we work together to find.

191
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:18,060
solution because any change to the system will have read across effects affecting a lot of other stakeholders and I agree with the secretary for justice just now who said that we should wait for the standing committee consultancy report to see what their findings are before.

192
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,580
嗯。

193
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,010
amongst the three law schools, am I correct?

194
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,770
does the does the bar have a view about participation?

195
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:33,360
All that we can do is simply to wait until they have come up at least with a tentative model, and then.

196
00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:02,280
And of course, there are some common subjects which is to be taken by all PCLO students.

197
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:54,010
For those students who intend to join the bar, they would be well advised to take at least the minimum requirement out of the bar options.

198
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:23,570
forward， and also I would like to ask how is it going to affect the bar stream and the solicitor stream of the PCCL course? Is there going to be any impact on that system?

199
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:53,350
因為，obviously，primary phase， it would be very unsatisfactory for bar students to take an examination set by the law society marked by the law society.

200
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:06,640
And that is something that needs to be worked out. And we like to see what models that could be tentatively agreed at least between the law society and the university first before we put in our idea.

201
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:58,960
yes that's good I have a question about the the possible model which is the role of the bar because it doesn't mention that it does mention bar association in the footnote but is is it envisaged that the bar would also play a part in this model

202
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:20,870
Now for those who did not actually take those bar options, then they may be required and they will be required in fact to go back to the university and take those subjects as part of their ALE course during their pupilage. That is the current position.

203
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:38,070
Moving forward, and I also am delighted to hear that the president of the Law Society agrees with the general direction of the commonly recognised assessment model as put out in the Appendix C of the Hong Kong use submission. I believe that is also the consensus.

204
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:25,970
Discussion is this, as far as we understand, the discussion is just between the law society and the three universities, and as far as we know, that the bar is excluded at this stage because of opposition from the law society. They do not want the bar to put in any view at this stage. So.

205
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:53,650
If there is the opportunity, then we'll put in our input. Okay. The reason I ask is again, I stress the importance of everyone to work together and to communicate together throughout this process. And as a representative of the legal profession, I don't want to act as a mailbox so that people can come to me and then I have to relay the message.

206
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:13,660
It shouldn't work like that. Everyone should come to the table. Everyone should participate in the process. So I encourage the bar to actively participate if the time comes that we have agreement or some a more concrete proposal regarding the way.

207
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:44,760
主席、副主席，的position是：，這是，當然，現時，PCCL是個Common Qualifying Exam，但係，非論，至於，就，法學，考試，而言，就，每，一所，大學，都有，一組，的，題目，，即係，廣義，講，係，法學，考試，題目。

208
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,160
樣嘅咧。

209
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,040
我諗。

210
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,220
譬如英國。

211
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,130
下一位係張麗雲議員。

212
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,550
啊，唔該，主席。

213
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,210
一樣嘅問題嚇，咁誒。

214
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:37,060
主席，我其實都聽到大家嘅意見啦。咁其實我都感覺好似啊～

215
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,260
我可唔可以問阿主席？我問啊，律師會嘅代表。好，洪會長。

216
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:07,870
出個問題係達到律師會覺得一個初初去做見習律師嗰個水平。

217
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:39,230
我哋嘅即係我唔可以話投訴，不過我哋睇得到個問題嘅誒精要咧，就係同一科裏邊問嗰啲問題，譬如話又講翻confession咁先算。

218
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:53,740
每間大學就翻嗰個科目裏邊考試嗰個問題咧，係唔一樣㗎嘛？嗯啊，咁變咗啊，即係我哋嘅睇法，律師會嘅睇法咧，就係啊，如果有一個

219
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:26,130
而家呢個討論可能係premature，因為而家仲未有一個初稿出嚟。如果將初稿出嚟，無論點都好，將來我相信大律師公會都要都要誒參與嘅，因為唔多，因為你叫改變戰時制度嘅話，一定會影響大律師公會。我我相信都係主席。

220
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:41,160
But what we are really concerned with is that if there is some sort of common assessment and questions are to be set by the law society in respect of some general paper, which are not really the bar option, of course. Then, so far as the bar students is concerned, we like to know the position.

221
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:57,350
啊！呢個啊，律師會目前嚟講只係一種想法啫，具體仲未好成型嘅係嘛？嚇，咁咧就但係已經得到咁多回響，都幾成功啦噉樣。咁即係不過咧，就我啱啱亦都係啊，即係啊，即係我我睇到文件咧，我就比較。

222
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:17,360
有關注咧，即係你哋其實個主要原因咧，就係認為而家咧就係嗰個PCL啊呢個啊嗰個標準咧，嗰個考試唔一樣。你係咪指緊即係佢哋唔同個學校提供唔同嘅考試，而佢哋嗰個嗰個考試嘅內容嘅標準係唔一樣？

223
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:28,160
係達到嗰個水平嘅。咁呢個問題畀三間大學一齊去考嗰啲學生咧，係會較為公公道啲咯。嗯，咁另外我就想再跟進兩個問題，都係問律師會嘅。咁咧就啊，我想問下咧，就而家咧就係啊，假如外國有啲律師嚇。

224
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:49,510
誒有律師，噉佢係一個好知名嘅律師，噉佢可唔可以嚟香港啊作做誒做執業律師咧？啊，呢個第一個問題。另外第二個問題，我問埋好唔好啊？咁咧，第二個問題，我想問咧誒，你哋律師呢個行業誒有冇啊一？

225
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,860
嗯。

226
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,200
啊。

227
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,510
啲問題嘅存在。

228
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,820
畀人哋問，畀人問。

229
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,420
就誒有一個公開統一嘅事係畀。

230
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,940
係，咁即係你認為實用經驗咧係好重要啊！張麗雲議員，好唔該你嚇，係第二輪。

231
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,160
OK，我首先講講咧就係誒，純理論上高講啦嚇。

232
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:54,460
資源誒，每一年要上誒滿十五分嘅continuing professional development嘅course，同埋仲有一個叫risk management。

233
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:30,010
誒法律即係畀讀完法律課程嘅學生，即係學位或者咩去到考，而去到攞到專業嘅資格資格咧，其實係都係有佢公平嘅地方嘅。

234
00:41:49,540 --> 00:42:02,880
咁呢個試有六份卷嘅嚇，咁誒考完之後，如果佢能夠誒合格嘅話，噉佢就可以變成香港嘅律師㗎啦。

235
00:40:49,510 --> 00:41:09,520
一個規定，譬如話係要每隔一段時間，你哋都要自己都要再考一個試，即係以提高或者係以協助翻律師本身嘅職業係啊，即係啊不斷即係達到即係最啊即係。

236
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:29,530
即係提高啦，噉樣嚇咁有冇咁咧？誒誒，有其實兩個問題。第一個咧係關於外國誒已經做咗律師嘅誒律師誒，如果嚟香港執業啊嘛，係咪嗯啊唔唔好意思，聽唔清楚。係噉，其實有個途徑嘅。噉我哋咧就誒。

237
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:49,540
香港律師會咧就有一個考試叫做Overseas Lawyers Qualification Exam。咁咧就如果呢位誒執業嘅外地嘅律師已經符合律師會個基本嗰個條件嘅話咧，噉佢咧就可以誒考呢個試啦。

238
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:23,180
即係你意思，即係佢哋都係考嗰個PCCL嗰個試。啊唔係唔係，呢個係誒呢個係律師會自己嘅考試嚟嘅。咁因為即係你話而家呢個制度，而家係有噉。因為我嘅睇法，即係如果佢係一個海外已經執業嘅律師咧，噉佢未必有噉嘅興趣就去。

239
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:43,190
翻讀P.C.L.從嗰個途徑嚇噉，但係咧佢可以從頭先我講個O.L.Q.E.個途徑咧，就誒去做香港律師咯。咁誒第二點咧就係我哋有呢個持續誒，我哋叫continuing。阿會長，唔該你簡潔啲答好嘛？我哋有㗎，即係我哋係要求會。

240
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:50,300
不過，如果真係有個噉嘅事嘅話咧，就冇乜可能，淨係律師會負責嘅，一定會係律師會、大律師公會同埋即係幾個法律學員一齊做，即係咁先會會會通嘅。咁咧就依家我知道律師會所提出呢個問題咧，其中一樣嘢就覺得依家P C L嗰個收生嗰度咧係有一啲。

241
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,100
and rethink.

242
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,460
Professor。

243
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,510
from you know um.

244
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,630
你會go go back and?

245
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,120
嗱，所以我有見 many students graduated locally or overseas.

246
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,450
where there should be some some improvement over over the system, now.

247
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,330
喺喺喺喺喺喺喺，the law degree，所以所以，that creates a problem。 now，

248
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,350
they got the lower you know low you know lower division in the second in second class owner.

249
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:07,070
都提過呢個問題，咩？Maybe I put the questions in English to to um to the law faculties.

250
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:16,400
會有冇任何回應？

251
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:59,520
咁呢點係引發到今次嘅討論，噉我覺得都係好事嚟嘅，即係大家都要傾傾。咁其實我都想趁呢個機會咧，我記得幾年前。

252
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:10,750
and then they seems to be permanently barred from going into the profession, because they they would never be given a second chance to to retake the exam and get a higher mark.

253
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:27,360
of the universities. Now, I remember about three to four years ago, we had also a joint session here in this council, where we where when we discussed about the ambition policy of the various law faculties. Now, I did mention the problems that arose from.

254
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:47,370
your selection criteria in restricting to admitting only students with good certain marks in the degree exam. For instance, you know either first class honours, second class honours, upper upper division, or good reasonably good marks in the in the second division.

255
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:21,920
Okay.

256
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,500
有冇見？

257
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,390
下第二輪。

258
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,860
係你當女騙子？

259
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,890
下一位梁美芬。

260
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,950
or any other feature, so we are working on it there.

261
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,990
就係誒一，因為三間法學院都有LLB同埋JD嘅。

262
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,180
有個系統，now where we we admit a certain number of people who don't qualify on their grades.

263
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,780
咁咧就啊，佢畢業亦都係有資格，應該係入到PCLL嘅。

264
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:19,240
咁但係咧，即係誒名額可能係唔足夠，甚至發展到近年嚟咧，誒有好多比較優秀嘅同學，佢可能已經去到係誒。

265
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:57,130
以前都開始提過嘅一啲誒誒討論咧，就係話誒應唔應該有一個公開嘅考試，即係好似其他嘅誒司法管轄區一樣。咁咧嗰啲同學咧就會比較誒甘心啦。佢起碼咧就係佢有個考試嘅機會，考唔到咧就唔會怪啦。

266
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:37,620
It is for this reason that in the last discussion, there has been suggestion that you should take into account some other factors, such as whether students have got a master degree, or he has certain experience in working the law firm and got recommendations.

267
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:59,800
Some reputable law firms or barristers. Now that should also be taken account in order to afford a second an alternative route to this to those students to to to to be able to gain entry into into profession. Now at that time, I remember that there had been assurances that they.

268
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:42,530
Yeah, I think it was about a year ago. Yeah, that the question was raised, and Hong Kong U, I think the other schools will speak for themselves. But Hong Kong U, we we have done a number of things here to to try to capture the people who have sort of fallen through the cracks. Yeah, we we have.

269
00:46:47,460 --> 00:47:07,470
So we interview them and we bring them in and under a special admissions scheme. So we are still we are still piloting that that that that system. Yeah. So we now have a few people in in the program who actually don't qualify on their results. Yeah. But we interviewed and we brought them in because of experience or commitment.

270
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:42,210
誒美分二係主席。首先我申報先啦，我自己係喺城市大學法學院係誒教J.D.嘅，噉就唔係教P.C.L.L.噉。另外咧，我自己嘅誒P.C.L.L.喺誒香港大學九零年代喺喺香港下大學都係誒讀佢嗰個P.C.L.L.課程。噉我諗咧喺呢一。

271
00:47:42,210 --> 00:48:02,220
方面咧都有一啲啊比較深入嘅一啲瞭解。我諗成個討論咧，應該係有一個社會嘅大環境喺過去一段時間。自從即係誒，應該係成大開始嘅，我哋有J.D.啦。自從有J.D.再加埋L.L.B.之後咧，的確我哋有好多嘅誒年輕嘅學生。

272
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:39,530
誒second upper可能咧，經過面試之後咧，誒都係入唔到PCLL。咁呢個情況咧就唔係淨係喺誒LLB嘅同學喺J.D嘅亦都有。咁所以喺咁大嘅競爭力睇下咧，即係一個誒好耐，差唔多十幾年。

273
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,110
誒。

274
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,760
仲有冇第二輪啊？可以有第二輪嚇。

275
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,420
啊！第一輪噉，我問一問，就係其實就唔係有。

276
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,930
我只係想即係表達三三三點嘅睇法啦。

277
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,580
咁因為我亦都聽到好多誒其他啲人士覺得係咪一個好似誒？

278
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:50,150
第一，當然喺統一考試，即係我喺統一考試個方向咧，佢牽涉嗰個改革係大嘅。

279
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:34,070
第一點就係即係而家係我見到係律師會同埋三所大學咧，都有一個建設性同埋一個有效嘅對話啦。我覺得呢件好事嚟嘅，我完全同意副主席嘅講法啊。

280
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:43,820
噉我就睇到咧，即係係誒立法會嘅秘書處佢提供嘅有幾個段落咧，我覺得誒可以繼續討論嘅。你第十六段、誒第十八段，同埋咧特別咧就係誒喺。

281
00:51:50,910 --> 00:52:08,660
即係司法考試噉樣去一次過考曬做律師，想做律師學生啊，理事會都研究過，不過始終覺得而家喺呢個階段啊，提出嚟嗰個方案係應該誒可以一試先。好，好唔該。啊，再冇其他人第一輪。

282
00:49:50,430 --> 00:50:08,710
誒誒提出呢個方向嘅前提並唔係話三間法學院嘅PCL係做得唔夠好，事實上我睇到佢哋不斷進步，而且咧係應該吸引到好優秀嘅學生都爭住翻嚟係讀我哋誒嘅PCL㗎，即係呢一個呢一個咧要肯定嘅。

283
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:22,350
咁所以咧喺一個噉嘅情況底下咧，其實誒，我相信大家考慮咧都係同學嘅利益同埋社會係點樣睇，既係唔可能係，人人都做到律師，同時咧，我哋又唔可以令到有一啲人佢係佢真係好有理想，但係佢喺而家呢個機制。

284
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:42,360
係底下咧，佢係做唔到律師，亦都當中當然包括有啲喺海外翻嚟嘅誒香港人啦。我認為係都係可能直情係second upper嘅。我睇到都係入唔到嘅。咁喺噉嘅情況底下咧，誒，我其實咧就本來有興趣咧問下律師會，即係其實而家大家應該係開放去睇呢件事。

285
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:29,000
但係，同時喺嗰個市場上咧，而家就好多，我覺得好似粉砌疾俗嘅嘅一啲又讀過法律係，噉佢又冇得考試。我哋點樣去處理呢個問題？噉我當然希望陳肇海大法官嗰個嘅檢討報告咧都可以考慮呢方面嘅情況，同埋誒喺我哋去再畀機會。

286
00:50:44,490 --> 00:51:04,500
第十六段咧就誒，因為我一路新報添，我係香港經濟民生聯盟。噉我記得嗰陣時可能有個年青嘅，唔知係咪法律嘅畢業生，係講咗意見啦。需唔需畀啲時間佢哋答咧？誒，我諗可以畀律師會講講，你哋其實考慮有冇考慮到係一個直情係同佢哋。

287
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:24,510
哋分開嘅一個separate alternative，即係話咧，法律學院有法律學院住，但係你哋有一個部分嘅quota係喺你哋嘅考試，有冇考慮過呢個方向係淨係做執業律師嘅咧？簡單啲答唔該係誒，好緊多謝professor誒。其實喺做呢個司儀嘅。

288
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:44,520
構思嗰陣時，我哋已經考慮過好多個模式，但係因為要平衡翻誒持份者嘅利益，咁所以咧誒我就有呢個噉嘅提議。噉我覺得誒試下行誒誒，而家提出嚟呢個方案。

289
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,170
咁第二輪咧。

290
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,840
權利同埋義務。

291
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,690
係一個uniform事嚟嘅。

292
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,650
讀唔同嘅課程，但係佢考嘅事係一樣嘅。

293
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:34,420
因為我嗰陣時自己本身咧，我就喺誒。

294
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:50,420
咁但係因為時代嘅變遷啦嚇，咁而家有三所大學。

295
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:40,150
英國讀嘅，噉我個史咧係由嗰個大律師。

296
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:05,130
就有四位嘅，我讀一讀名先啦。就係副主席啦，蔣麗雲議員、何俊仁議員同埋梁美芬議員。

297
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:44,970
咁第二點咧，就係以前咧，就係只係得香港大學辦呢個PCL課程，因為只有一家大學辦呢個誒法律誒課程嘅。

298
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:11,260
就係我亦都好高，高然見到咧有一個叫commonly recognised assessments喺呢一方面咧，我覺得係走向一個即係我個人認為係走向一個啱嘅方向啦。

299
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:24,620
search最少我助理幫我做好多research嘅，就係為無論你喺我哋比較接近啲一啲一啲司法管轄區咧，例如即係英國啊、澳洲啊、紐約巴、舊波尼巴咧，啲人考試咧，佢哋可能係。

300
00:52:50,700 --> 00:53:10,710
誒有城市大學啦，繼而繼後亦都有中文大學，咁變咗係佢三所大學嗰個，佢冇一個統一嗰個一個誒標準，有冇統一個試去去考咧？噉我話呢樣係未必真係咁理想嘅，因為我就未見過咧，即係我就做過。

301
00:53:40,430 --> 00:54:00,440
嗰個誒Institute School of Law度set咗噉，你可以去其他啲啲Polytechnic所讀，或者Urban Law Trillers所私立啲地方都讀到，但係考嘅事係一樣嘅，就冇有分別喺度。咁所以咧就我見到，如果係最少喺呢個誒核心課程裏邊咧，所謂core subjects裏邊咧係。

302
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:32,090
咁第三點咧，就係呢個係如果係能夠達到共識嘅話咧，我相信呢個亦都係體現到即係誒律師個行業嗰個專業自主，即係嗰個對於嗰個入行嗰個個質素保值咧，都係有佢嗰個自主權喺度。即係如果係睇到，因為

303
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:52,290
法例係畀律師呢一個自主權喺度嘅，即係控，即係佢有個責任同埋有個權利去控制呢個入行嗰個質素。咁變咗，亦都係如果係大家能夠達成共識嘅話咧，咁大喺呢一方面咧，亦都係體現到即係法例畀啊律師會嘅。

304
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:26,210
副主席、主席，誒，我都係想跟進翻頭先個討論咧，就係如果大家都認為三分鐘好嘛，好啊。誒，如果大家都認為依一個誒，即係commonly recognised assessment係一個大家都係同意嘅方向咧，誒向前嚟計嘅話咧，會唔會有一個啊類似係誒一個協調小組噉，大家去討論噉樣，有冇？

305
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,240
啊！

306
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,100
所以或者第三輪啦，好唔好啊？簡單嚟講。

307
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,410
裏邊誒想做。

308
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,970
哦，OK，即係你你哋等緊係啲。

309
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:30,170
有冇傾過去成立一個噉樣嘅小組？啊，會長。

310
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:55,240
嘅執行唔應該有個噉樣retrospective嘅誒effect啦，所以我哋就希望可以係誒二零二二年先進行。噉樣嘅話，就現時所喺法律學入面學生都唔會受到影響。好多謝誒，主席。

311
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:19,280
一年個問題咧，其實頭先咧，誒廣大嗰個法律學院個代表咧，唔係即係廣大誒同學生法律學院個誒代表，你係咪講過話希望二零二二先成立啊？你可唔可以再講講你嘅觀點？

312
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:50,470
你是會考慮過咧？我哋係唔會公開個報告嘅。咁因為誒，第一誒，即係呢個係一個我即係consulting畀我哋嘅一個advice，即係我哋睇。

313
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:46,200
律師會同三間大學咧可以達成共識，誒誒，因為頭先我答阿阿梁議員咧，就我哋都諗過好多模式，誒，始終覺得而家現時呢個方向咧係可以平衡到。

314
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:36,730
前做過一個誒誒一個諮詢嘅咁有好多誒律師會嘅會員都問我可唔可以問你哋去睇嗰個諮詢嘅報告，因為佢哋都想知道大家係點樣睇呢一件事噉樣。你可唔可以公開個報告咧？誒。

315
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:57,860
即係好話唔好聽，我都想將自己嘅houseput in order先啦，係咪啊？噉啊，到時候咧啊，我一定會諮詢三間大學佢哋嘅意見，甚至大律師公會嚇。咁喺呢個階段，我希望係啊，即係我自己律師會。

316
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:20,700
嘅嘢誒，起碼個初型或者所謂嘅即係個structure啊，要整咗先啦嚇。即係你最初所講嘅未走個內部嗰個討論係咪？未有一個內部討論未？係啦，冇錯啦，係啦。啊，多謝主席。噉我另外想想問就係律師會咧，其實我都知道誒，你哋以前。

317
00:56:50,750 --> 00:57:10,760
咁誒，裏邊亦都有啲提議咧。我哋根本而家想做嘅嘢咧，我哋已經包括咗喺度嘅。誒，我會講咧就係誒，即係嗰個Standing Committee on Legal Education嗰個Consultancy Report咧。誒，我哋都會去考慮嘅。

318
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:30,770
嚇！我哋一定會考慮入邊講嘅內容。誒，不過現時香港律師會咧係打算喺唔早過二零二一年之前咧就會推出呢個所謂嘅Common Entry Exam。啊，我亦都好有信心香港。

319
00:57:46,480 --> 00:58:06,490
所有嘅stakeholder嘅利益嘅，即係我我我講翻個意見啦，就係有好多會員咧，認為就係即係佢哋誒有份畀錢去做呢一個誒諮詢報告，噉佢哋都想睇翻嗰個報告內容。噉我希望理事會可以再諗一諗啦，可唔可以公佈嗰個報告啦？噉我覺得都係一個好合理嘅要求嚟嘅。不過頭先你講到二零二。

320
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,660
OK。

321
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,050
誒損害prejudice。

322
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,960
我previous議員啊，Mr. Morris， whoever。

323
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,830
如個聲明咧，其實係律師會嘅底線嚟嘅，因為當時我唔知道。

324
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:17,480
即係如果二零二一年去考而家呢個模式嘅考試咧，會對嗰啲學生有啲咩嚴重嘅？

325
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:12,900
啊，何俊仁議員。Okay, Chairman, I give my time to Mr. Morris and Mr. Lam to respond to my previous question about the review of the admission criteria of your PCR programme. Sorry, Miss Professor Geng.

326
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:54,420
想避免唔想見到嘅嘢咧，似乎都係有個默契嘅嚇。咁如果真係能夠達成嘅話咧，咁誒最主要嘅學生咪唔使考兩次試咯，或者容許我好快。

327
00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:08,870
第五年讀mixed degree啲學生，其實今日佢哋都要考一個試㗎啦。故無論邊一年，佢都考一個試。如果最後嘅結果啲學生唔使考兩個試嘅話咧，噉我亦都睇唔到。

328
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:43,110
好簡簡短啲答。好冇問題，係其實因為我哋之所以有呢個考慮係因為誒，我哋部分嘅學生其實現時係讀緊一個double degree嘅課程啦，咁個課程就係有五年嘅，所以如果係噉樣嘅情況嘅話，我哋就呢啲同學就將會係第一屆受影響嘅同學，咁但係我哋認為呢一個誒誒同一執業。

329
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:16,430
啊啊！主席，我再要，我再仲想問律師會一個問題。我啱啱聽到咧，就係你講話，嗯，即係你哋而家初步有啲諗法咧，就係跟住讀完咗PCCL咧，噉就係唔需要考呢個統一試，係咪咁諗啊？係咪咁講嘅？誒，其實噉樣嘅，誒，我哋一

330
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:41,220
我哋同誒三間大學嘅商議，會唔會真係可以有個共識啊？咁所以我哋就話嗱，我哋希望就有一個獨立嘅律師會嘅事啊。咁之後到今日嘅發展咧，誒誒，我好高興就同三間大學咧，就已經起碼目標，即係我哋。

331
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:40,590
啊！即係我唔，我唔知。我我當然你能夠提供話畀我聽點解唔應該啊？嗱，不如咁啦嚇噉，我覺得你都答咗個問題㗎啦嗱。咁其實咧，我可以誒想像到學生嘅心情。我入嚟嘅話，我諗住啊讀完幾年，跟住就讀埋嗰個PCL。

332
01:00:40,590 --> 01:01:00,600
噉啊，搞掂！而家你突然間話多個試噉，梗係即係最好唔好啦，係咪？噉你令到啲學生嘅負擔重咗。不過咧，嗱，我喺度又喺度諗緊啦嚇。噉你以為假如話有冇噉嘅可能咧，就係誒，即係幾間大學，即係因為橫掂你哋而家個試咧，假如話唔同。

333
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:20,610
統一咧唔係咁標準咧，咁會唔會咧？你大家一齊，連埋律師會一齊咁咧，大家出一個字，淨係一個啫，噉就標準化嘅嚇。噉啊，又有冇噉嘅可能咧？咁噉，因為你哋唔標準嗰個情況依然存在啊嘛。就算律師會第日自己有個。

334
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,380
yes.

335
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,350
好。

336
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,270
兩尾分魚。

337
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:26,970
開麥啊！唔該。

338
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,780
林峯教授會補充。

339
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:39,760
所以，combination of reviewing our admission strategies and expanding our numbers, I think, should go some way to meeting concerns.

340
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:29,670
Increased number of places on the PCCL once the double cohort has made their way through, and that is actually quite a substantial increase from 150 to 200 places.

341
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:55,190
There was a more radical proposal which emerged in the discussions about a year ago, which was to look at a model which is based on the the overseas lawyers qualifying examination.

342
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:52,840
幾啊， couple of points. First, with regard to the consideration of other factors such as LLN degree or recommendation letters, actually those have been taken into account in our existing PCL admission process.

343
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:32,630
for those who failed in their first time application to the PCLL by particularly taking into account their working experience. So we've done it last year and we'll monitor the progress of those students to see how the policy should be further reviewed.

344
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:40,620
司義之後係嘛？你哋嗰個PCLL嗰個試都係唔唔唔係標準啊嘛？會唔會考慮呢一度咧？噉我希望咧，因為好似啱啱律政司嚇所講嘅，就係話無論我哋未來發展方向如何咧，一定咧以公眾利益為依歸。假如係咁咧，

345
01:01:40,620 --> 01:02:00,630
我會企喺未來嘅律師嚇啊，甚至學生嘅立場去諗，OK，係咪可以考一個公開試最好啦？噉樣，噉我覺得值得考慮去考慮呢個方向，或者第日喺大家個協調小組度傾咯，係嘛？佢哋係朝住你所講嘅方向走緊，而家就好啊，唔該。

346
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:38,060
Mr. Morris was not able to be here. I'll I'll speak for both of us in that case. We are doing something very similar to what was described by Professor Ho from Hong Kong University. We have a task force at the moment who are looking into alternate routes into the PCCL. The chances are that.

347
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:58,070
但係，會 conclude that for those students who do not succeed on the basis of academic performance, there will be alternative arrangements, including interview and other forms of of evaluation of their suitability for admission to the PCLL programme. and

348
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:18,080
That's that's in addition to other things that have been happening, of course, including expanding the numbers of students on the PCLL. All the law schools had to do this anyway to accommodate the so-called double cohort. And speaking, I can only speak for my own university. It's likely that we will continue the.

349
01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:15,480
And to extend that idea to, for example, candidates for admission who had worked as legal executives or some other form of legally related employment in Hong Kong for an appropriate period of time, and that seems to me to be an idea that it might still be useful to explore.

350
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,080
係。

351
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,100
自己係唔反對。

352
01:08:53,460 --> 01:09:01,210
有冇誒？先生講過。I like to say something about the bar's stance on commonality in the qualification.

353
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:57,950
你 still face with the problem that there are option subjects, so there are students who take particular options and they are stronger in those fields.

354
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:32,370
Each having a slightly different syllabi for their PCLL, so long as the lowest possible one is still of acceptable standard.

355
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:12,010
for the same reason, even if they all take one same paper, unless every question in the paper is a compulsory one, and you have to pass each and every question, you cannot actually ensure.

356
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:30,460
咁咧，所以咧就誒希望喺立法會傾嘅原因咧，就係佢希望即係將來我哋真係希望一個更健康嘅方向咧。咁其實其實個門檻係擺喺邊嘅啫。咁如果你擺到畀同學，佢係即係一路讀落去，我哋一樣可以係有現有咁多嘅嘅課程嘅。

357
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:49,110
We think that should be fine. The reason being that there should and there could never be any sort of absolute commonality in any qualifying examination, even if you have got just one law school and having one PCLL.

358
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:13,870
我其實好希望大家唔好用持份者呢個字去講，因為咧其實我知道我接觸咧喺喺公眾嚟講咧，佢正正就係覺得我哋呢個檢討全部就係持份者，即係法學院或者兩大即係專業團體咧，都係持份者。

359
01:04:53,530 --> 01:05:13,540
第二個點是，那什麼你提到上次在這個 panel，和實際上在那場會議，我們有討論，在我們的法律學院，我們審視和修改了我們的錄取政策，通過設置幾個配額。

360
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:56,560
啊！我哋都係始終睇翻咧，其實即係喺長遠個發展咧，應該即係而家都係講緊五年、七年或者十年之後嘅。即係如果係而家我見到你哋嘅方向咧，就係已經如果真係三間法學院同律師會傾掂數，加埋出一份統一嘅考卷，咁咧一定兼顧教育學啦。

361
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:16,610
你出得卷咧，你就要有份去教，因為令到嗰啲同學係知道你想要乜啦。呢個係第一點嗱。但係如果我哋真係行到第一步，即係我係睇得遠一啲嘅，即係行到第一步有個統一嘅考試，其實咧，即係將來嚟講咧，就係問題，我哋個門檻擺喺邊嘅啫嗱。而家個門檻咧就係其實你係誒入。

362
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:36,620
PCL嘅門檻就好高嘅，高好多啦。咁入到咧，應該有八成係可以畢業出到嚟做律師。咁如果將來會唔會可以褪後？就係話，即係嗰個統一考試，就係即係更多嘅人，佢讀完JD或者LLB，佢就可以再讀一個誒，譬如三間。

363
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:56,630
法學院加埋你哋律師會，就係將來可能即係我呢一個睇法，就係話大律師公會佢哋如果嗰個市就當然一齊要參與啦。因為而家P.C.L兩樣都做得㗎嘛，即係畢畢業P.C.L。咁咧，其實就可以其實邁向個方向係一個可以有機會係公開嘅統一考試。我反為覺得。

364
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:50,750
對，最後佢大家一齊考一個公開試，咁咧就心甘命抵啦嚇。即係其實誒，你可能係有律師所嘅經驗，而家讀唔到P.C.，你可能冇。總之大家又考個試，考唔到你唔好怪人。咁呢一樣嘢咧就會減少咗好多嗰種抱怨。即係我自己係即係誒誒從。

365
01:07:50,750 --> 01:08:10,760
長遠去睇，呢個一定唔係即時可以做到嘅嘢。但係如果你哋能夠行出跨出第一步，即係我都好強調，包括可能兩個律師會最後係一定要有教與學嘅，因為你畀得個考試我咧，我都要確保同學覺得你教咗我，我我符合到你，我就要過關㗎嘛。呢個係好重要嘅。咁呢一個咧，我就想睇下。

366
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:30,770
誒，即係聽下大家睇呢方面嘅意見嘅啫啦。如果講持份者，肯定唔係呢一批，而家五年、七年或者甚至十年先有機會實踐嘅嘢。呢個方向會唔會係大家比較開放可以去考慮咧？咁兩邊誒法學院或者係律師會，甚至係啊大律師公會都可以評價下咧。

367
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:50,930
我諗時間就冇乜㗎啦。係陳生，唔緊要啦。就一個噉樣嘅誒誒諗法去誒專研啊，即係究竟大幾時做，誒點樣做，噉就要花啲時間啦。但係即係成個concept，誒我自己。

368
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,340
好。

369
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,080
你。

370
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,020
我都好樂意聽到。

371
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,330
第二 best， which is to ensure。

372
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:15,090
共鳴度喺所有啲standout。

373
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,740
O.K.，咁有冇其他委員係有問題？

374
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:03,760
O.K.，咁好，我哋呢一次到此為止啊！多謝大家出席，多謝，多謝。

375
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:22,450
以公律政司同埋法律相關組織作辦公辦公室用途。

376
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:56,950
需唔需要有一個總結嘅會議？誒，我唔需要啦，我好樂觀，我哋應該可以傾得埋啦。

377
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:17,370
噉我哋而家進入議程嘅第四項，就係前中區政府合署西座進行翻新工程。

378
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:48,700
噉我哋就誒，咁呢個節咧就到呢度為。sorry，我想問一問就係阿洪會長或者係司長有冇有冇總結嘅回應有冇？

379
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:32,790
That the minimum qualifying examination standard, qualifying standard, is achieved by each of the providers。多謝你意見。

380
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:46,120
Anything could move forward. Take, say, for instance, the medical exam, medical profession. We have got the Chinese university. We have got the Hong Kong university medical degree.

381
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:59,350
And of course, at the moment at least, graduates from either university do not have to take another examination, another common examination, in order to practice as a medical practitioner in Hong Kong.

382
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:21,660
The bar association keep an open mind on this question. We are not convinced that there must be a common examination for entrance into the profession. What is most important is that now, given the status quo, i.e., we have got three universities.

383
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:35,380
所以它係always一matter of degree。所以，實際上，什麼是required， is the lowest possible standard is still of acceptable standard。Now that is one view。But of course， we are not opposing to any common examination。But our position is it doesn't appear to be a must before any。

384
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:19,640
So we keep an open mind on the matter. That is the position of the bar. And of course, if things could be done well and good, and if for rather technical reasons or other reasons, historical reasons or otherwise, if it is not at all possible, not feasible, then of course we should settle with the.

385
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:05,380
係。

386
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,330
幫你講。

387
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:27,020
噉我哋而家先請有關嘅官員入會議室。

388
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:56,130
請律政司政務專員啊，蕭生咧就簡介前中區政府合署西座嘅二二翻新工程。

389
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:49,650
咁而依個舊政府總部嘅中東西座咧，係評為咧係一級嘅歷史建築㗎。咁所以咧，我哋咧係好重視嗰個。

390
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:16,870
咁喺呢一個誒項目裏邊咧，就大家都收到兩份文件嘅。第一份就係CB括弧四八八四stroke十五至十六括弧零六號文件。

391
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:27,100
就係政府當局有關喺前中區政府合署西座進行翻新工程，以公律政司同埋法律相關組織作辦公室用途嘅文件。

392
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:08,730
係主席，誒，我哋文件咧係建議就前中區政府合署西座咧係進行翻新同埋保育工程咧，作為律政司同埋法律相關組織嘅辦公室用途嘅。

393
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:41,710
噉我哋咧就係誒前政府合署嘅西座咧，我哋希望將佢保留同埋翻新啦，作為律政司未能夠搬入去中東座嘅辦公室同埋法律相關組織咧係使用。

394
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:20,500
成為一個咧係法律嘅樞紐，而我哋咧希望咧就係話將喺合署嘅西座同埋喺傳道樓嘅部分地方咧係提供畀咧係法律相關機構咧係使用，去有助咧提升香港咧成為一個亞太區法律同埋解決爭與服務嘅樞紐。

395
01:15:49,930 --> 01:16:08,060
翻新同埋保育嘅工程咧，亦都係邀請咗咧係依個誒依個建築公司咧，係幫我哋做一個文物嘅影響評估，同埋咧我哋都諮詢咗古物諮詢委員會同埋中西區區議會嘅意見。噉佢哋對於我哋嘅翻新保育建議咧，都係表示支持嘅。

396
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:40,010
咁誒律政司咧係遷往咗合署嘅中東座之後咧，我哋其實咧已經係騰出咗咧喺金鐘咧一千八百平方米咧係租用嘅地方咧，係畀私營機構同埋其他政府部門使用。我哋每年咧係已經係節省咗租金嘅開支咧係一千六百萬元嘅。

397
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:28,220
咁呢個前政府合署中東座嘅大樓咧，就已經翻新咗做律政中心啦。而我哋律政司嘅部分辦公室咧，就已經係遷入咗。咁但係咧，係律政司嘅刑事檢控科同埋部分嘅辦公室咧，而家咧依然留喺呢個金鐘道政府合署同埋金鐘附近租用嘅地方嘅。

398
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:47,550
咁第二份文件係C.B.股四八八四stroke十五至十六括號零七號文件，就係香港國際仲裁中心嘅意見書。我哋歡迎啊肖如斌啊專員同埋佢嘅同事啊參加呢個會議。咁喺誒同事發言之前咧，我想先。

399
01:14:42,530 --> 01:15:02,540
咁希望咧，將來咧就律政司下所有嘅科別咧，都係集中喺前政府合署，咁有助提升我哋部門嘅運作效率。而前政府合署中東西座咧，加埋依個前法國外方傳道樓大樓咧，即係前中審法院大樓咧，將來咧係會發展咧係。

400
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:28,350
咁而我哋咧係誒建議咧對西座咧而家進行嘅咧就係第一保育工程咧，去保存、修補同埋依個修復建築物咧係別具特色嘅元素，同埋咧係修復進行一啲修復工程咧，拆除一啲咧同建議用途目標不一致嘅誒可廢棄嘅設施，同埋恢復建。

401
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,230
誒有冇委員發言？

402
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:26,060
或者發問係副主席四分鐘。

403
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:58,650
法院前中心法院嗰個大樓咧，係唔係是否適合去做呢個仲裁中心啦？因為大家都知道，其實仲裁中心係需要好多大型嘅一個誒活誒一個。

404
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:18,060
一個公務小組委員會同埋財務委員會咧，係申請撥款。咁如果工程能夠喺今年年尾第四季展開咧，噉我哋估計咧喺二零一八年第四季咧就可以完工。多謝主席。

405
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:45,730
建築物咧係佢一九五九年咧係落成嘅時候嘅嘅原設計概念，咁同埋亦都進行一啲改建工程咧，等到建築物咧係符合法律要求啦，包括係走火通道啊、無障礙通道嗰啲誒要求啦，我哋嘅運作需要同埋現今嘅規格。

406
01:16:46,240 --> 01:17:06,250
咁同埋咧，亦都咧係會進行一啲咧係工地規劃同埋露天空地公眾出入口通道咧係進行一啲改善嘅工程嘅。噉我哋咧係估計咧係建築嘅工程費用咧，大概係十億七千八百九十萬。咁如果得到委員會嘅支持咧，我哋希望稍後咧就會去立法會誒嘅。

407
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:47,140
其實主席，我哋都討論過呢個議題啦。以前都噉就誒，我睇到咧就係誒呢個香港國際仲裁中心就入咗一份文件，裏邊就講到佢哋對於呢個呢個整個工程嘅一啲意見啦。當然今日我哋主要唔係討論嗰個誒前中心法院大樓嗰個裝修。

408
01:17:47,140 --> 01:18:07,150
但係呢一個亦都係啊，同我哋而家今日討論嗰樣嘢息息相關咧。因為你個構想就係誒係將以前嗰個中心法院同埋而家部分嘅西翼大樓一齊作為一個誒國際仲裁中心嘅樞紐嘅一個建設啊嘛，係嘛？我嘅理解係啱係誒。

409
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:27,160
主席，誒，我哋嗰個構想咧係依希望咧係將依個成個誒依個舊政府總部嘅中東西座咧，再加埋依個前中審法院誒嘅大樓咧，就成為一個未來嘅法律書樓。咁所以依方面咧嘅理解係正確嘅。而關於咧係舊中審法院大樓。

410
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:47,170
咧，我哋而家咧亦都係準備緊咧，係誒一個建議咧，係將佢咧係作出適當嘅翻新同埋保育，等到佢咧係將來可以畀法律相關機構使用。噉我哋咧希望咧係稍後咧就會就依一個計劃咧就會嚟委員會咧係徵詢議員嘅意見啦，然後咧我哋再向咧係。

411
01:18:47,170 --> 01:19:07,180
係公務小組咧，係申請撥款噉，但係我而今日講嘅咧就係依個前政府合署西座嗰個工程，咁兩個工程咧係分開嗱。即係誒，我嘅關注點咧，其實亦都係希望即係呢一個項目係可以真係成為一個成功嘅一個誒標誌啦。就係因為而家香港仲。

412
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:27,190
仲裁嘅發展確實係非常之重要，對於法律界嚟講，對於香港整體嚟講，我哋都希望成為一個仲裁同埋一個誒誒糾紛嘅一個誒解決嘅中心。咁所以誒，如果你誒投放嘅資源係唔足夠嘅話咧，其實未必係吸引到一啲誒國際仲裁中心同。

413
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:47,200
埋咧係人事利用香港作為一個誒誒解決嘅誒爭議嘅地方，咁所以誒即係我希望局方明白投放資源係非常之重要。咁誒而家即係誒有仲裁中心就話誒，其實佢哋係擔心誒第一嗰個誒中心。

414
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,780
噉。

415
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,840
唔該。

416
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,730
梁國雄。

417
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,410
嗰啲你需要幾多程作業？

418
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,820
係邊啲嘅機構攞到幾多地方噉樣？明白。咁所以其實你哋需要幾多？

419
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:50,240
係你個文文件裏邊嘅法律相關機構係咪就係嗰個仲裁中心啊？你不停咁講係咪就係嗰個仲裁中心？

420
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:19,590
樓面面積啦，如果要包含包包含曬你文文裏邊所講嘅有關呢個誒相關嘅嘅法律機構，有冇一個？

421
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:31,410
係，咁嗰個藍圖喺度。即係話會唔會地方係第一足唔足夠，定係話係即係太多地方，即係會有一個多咗地方出現。太多地方就唔會㗎啦。

422
01:22:53,470 --> 01:23:07,280
有申請嘅人，噉佢仲要經過我哋，即係誒嘅你嘅遴選又好、審核又好，先至知道邊個嗰啲相關機構係乜嘢啊嘛。噉你個腦裏邊有冇？

423
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:53,190
幾多嘅呢一個誒正作業樓面嘅面積，你有冇估計咧？即係正話阿郭郭，我哋個副主席郭議員就話為嗰個好嘥地方嘅喎嗰啲嘢，噉你有個估計㗎嘛？係咪？你需要幾多正作業嘅樓面？因為你而家話。

424
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:37,080
有個概念咧，我哋希望咧就係話誒用到咧係依個前中審法院大樓加埋我哋咧係西座嗰個地方咧，能夠咧係作出一個靈活嘅調配咧，係可以提供到咧係適當嘅地方咧，去容納依啲咧係法律相關機構咧佢哋所需要嘅設施。

425
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:19,090
啊，會議廳又好，或者啊開庭時候用嘅啊啊房間又好啦，其實需要好多個。或者如果佢做調解嘅時候咧，更加需要咧係有啲breakout room畀其他誒誒人士咧去去用去傾噉樣。咁其實仲裁都係，尤其是而家國際仲裁咧，可能牽涉係十幾個啊。

426
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:39,100
啊啊啊啊！當事人嘅咁可能十幾個律師團隊咧，其實而家舊誒中審法院嗰個誒大樓咧，確實真係做唔到依樣嘢。咁誒西翼係會點樣？即係而家誒會用係咪部分嘅政府合署去做呢一個誒仲裁廳咧？係咪噉樣嘅構想咧？

427
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:59,110
先生，係主席誒。首先咧，我係絕對同意咧，係要投放即係適當嘅資源咧，去推動香港咧，係作為一個咧係法律事務同埋依個誒解決爭議嘅一個中心嗰個地位啦。咁誒，我哋喺依方面，譬如喺建築物提供一個法律書樓咧，可以講話係一個硬件嗰方面嘅配合啦。

428
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:19,120
咁另外，其實我哋早前咧，亦都嚟咗委員會咧，就係誒依個誒建議咧，我哋開設一啲新嘅職位咧，係去推動咧香港個仲裁嗰方面嘅工作。咁依個咧，亦都係可以講話喺軟件嗰方面咧，去配合個推動工作嘅。咁誒，至於係講到咧，係依個誒，我哋而家嗰個法律書。

429
01:21:50,540 --> 01:22:10,550
誒主席，我哋誒所講嘅法律相關嘅機構咧，就係話講緊喺香港咧，我哋係誒提供一啲國際嘅法律師誒服務咧，同埋咧係解解決咧係爭議嘅一啲咧法律相關嘅機構。咁呢個咧當然包括咧係呢個香港國際仲裁中心啦。咁但係仲有其他咧係。

430
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:30,560
呢個相關嘅組織嘅，或者我請阿阿黃專員呢方面有冇補充？係啊，黃專員冇錯嘅，係有其他嘅誒法法律相關服務嘅機構嘅。咁呢啲咧就將來咧係會有個委員會啦，就會而家我哋收咗一啲嘅誒申請啦。咁呢啲申請咧，最終個委員會咧係會決定咧。

431
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,550
亦可以畀本會知道嘅咧。

432
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,080
明白，噉我明白啦。

433
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,810
好，第誒第一輪兩尾分議。

434
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:13,190
可唔可以畀本會醒諗一下邊廿五份？

435
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:38,340
係好樂意嚟委員會咧，向議員彙報，係提供個結果，亦話。

436
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:35,050
噉我我想問你，呢個委員會有冇發表諮詢文件啊？或者有乜嘢？

437
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:28,160
咁即係你而家有一個叫法律輸留空間分配委員會，由律政司司長擔任主席嘅嘛，係咪？

438
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:18,630
係四千幾平方米嘅地方咧，畀法律相關機構使用。噉我哋覺得依個數目咧，暫時係適當。

439
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:07,430
係地方咧，依啲噉嘅資料咧係提供畀業，唔得唔到嗰啲咧，即係話你，譬如講你廿五揀咗五個，咁有二十個唔得，噉。

440
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:36,660
嘅資料咧係咪可以咧係呢個公開咧？咁依方面我係會徵詢有關團體嘅資料，然後咧適當向立法會彙報。

441
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:09,390
機構嘅申請有一個結果嘅時候咧，我哋稍後咧亦都會再嚟委員會咧，係同大家彙報。係你收到廿五份申請，噉你打算批批准幾多份咧？

442
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:51,700
係誒主席，或者呢度咧，我哋其實喺文件嘅誒註釋錄嗰度咧，已經係作出一個詳細嘅解釋咧。就係話咧，我哋係將來咧係西翼嗰度咧，我哋誒估計咧係可以用到嘅樓面面積咧，大概係一萬二千九百咧，係呢個平方米。咁其中咧係九千九百。

443
01:23:51,700 --> 01:24:11,710
百咧嘅平方米嘅地方咧，我哋係用為咧作為律政司自己本身嘅辦公室，而另外咧大概三千零米咧係會騰出嚟咧，畀相關法律機構使用嘅。咁而呢三千零米咧，再加埋將來咧係誒舊中審法院大樓咧嘅地方咧，我哋相信咧係可以咧係提供到咧。

444
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:58,500
誒主席，依個委員會咧就由誒律政司係擔任主席，亦都有咧係依個業界法律界嘅代表咧係參與嘅。咁其實咧係相關嘅工作咧，我哋誒早前咧亦都嚟過咧係委員會彙報。噉我哋亦都希望咧就係話，我哋喺嗰個誒審議員依啲相關法律。

445
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:33,660
答唔答到咧？定係定係喺未？你未進行呢個決定之前，你唔方便公佈嗰廿五份申請，定係點啊？係主席，我哋呢方面咧，因為目前咧係淨係進行嗰個審議工作咧，所以個資料咧我哋係唔方便提供嘅。咁但係喺我哋完成咗審議工作有結果嘅時候咧，我哋。

446
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:58,630
提供咗結果，亦話係誒交代嗰廿五個裏邊有邊個得，邊個唔得，定係點啊？定係有個有有會有有個報告書話畀我哋聽，定係點？專員主席，到時我哋有結果時候咧，我哋亦都係誒好樂意係將誒邊啲團體咧係得到咧係誒嗰個分配。

447
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:27,750
佢二十個，我哋會唔會知？同埋佢哋點解會落選嘅理由，我哋會唔會知？係專員誒，其他嗰啲團體咧，因為即係佢哋提供資料畀我哋咧，主要都係附誒為咗咧係申請呢個誒喺呢個法律書樓嗰度到將來辦公室啦。噉我哋都需要徵詢佢哋意見咧，佢哋。

448
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:05,790
嗰個地方係更加方便，啊！佢哋處理國際嘅事務。

449
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:43,510
好，咁多謝啊梁美芬議員意見。咁又有冇其他發言？我想。

450
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:35,960
嚇！咁所以，我覺得個要求應該係嚴格，裏邊包括一個嚴肅性喺度嘅。

451
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:08,860
範圍咧當時亦都列出咗㗎啦，咁呢個誒較早前咧係應該係向本會係有提供嘅，咁但係我哋會後亦都可以再提供多一次嘅。

452
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:58,710
嗰方面咧係會咧係分開嘅，咁至於嗰啲組織嘅誒性質啊，會唔會包括調解嗰啲啊？咁或者請阿黃專員補充。誒，根據我哋誒誒提供畀

453
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:37,160
嗰個誒可以容許其他團體去申請咧，大唔大啊，細唔細㗎喎？呢個都喺嗰個定義範圍之內。嚇，咁但係點知道嘅咧？啲組織嚇嘅嗰啲嗰啲組織係點會點知道可以去申請？嚇係嘛？一個一個公開嘅誒。

454
01:26:40,240 --> 01:27:00,250
係主席嗱，據我所瞭解咧，你文件裏邊第六段講，至於提供相關組織使用嘅地方，當然就包括頭先即係話你話夾埋中審法院、前中審法院大樓。我哋喺呢度都試過有一節嘅討論。咁當然啊，國際仲裁中心嗰邊都嚟講，佢希望佢而家。

455
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:26,080
誒，但係即係如果我嘅我理解或者我諗下，你裡面應該可能會包括埋一啲，譬如調解嘅中會唔會有包括埋調解嘅中心咧？佢係有一啲叫做係啊，佢係帶有係可以協助啊解決誒民間一啲法律紛爭，佢有一個角色嘅。

456
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:46,090
係咪係咪呢一類咧？誒誒，因為咧嗱，好老實講，我都係好想了解你話，當律政司嘅辦公室佢會同其他團體去有機會共用啦，即係你第五段裏邊所講有其他團體去申請。啊，第一當然即係我哋會尊重律政司，佢當然。

457
01:27:46,090 --> 01:28:06,100
裏面有好多佢要啊，自己保密啊，有好多官方嘅嘢，係咪咁？如果你係畀其他嘅團體去申請嘅時候，咩團體咧？即係誒誒乜嘢嘅條件會可以申請到？係邊類嘅團體佢又適唔適合共用咁喺個大樓大家出出入入嘅咧？即係即係呢？

458
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:26,110
呢個誒，我哋都係想有興趣要了解咧，係你公佈之前，我都希望要了解係咪一個適合嘅組合嚟嘅咧？嚇，噉你係咪公眾可以去我哋某啲係話係同法律相關嘅？咁又係咪可以申請咧？咁即係呢啲係重要嘅嚇。但係我覺得因為律政司係一個非常

459
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:46,120
重要嘅部門啦，嚇！我想誒係啦。專業係主席，或者依度我首先強調咧，將來我哋喺嗰個西藥個分配地方嘅做法咧，就係話誒律政司同埋咧係依啲相關嘅法律組織咧係各自有咧係獨立嘅樓層嘅，咁所以咧喺嗰個出入。

460
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:19,000
誒呢啲機構申請嗰個範圍咧，係包括咗與調解誒都有關嘅機構，佢哋都可以申請。嗯，咁會唔會亦都可能係有一啲係培訓嘅咧？即係譬如誒法律培訓嘅嘅誒工作，咁會唔會都係屬於即係你你頭先講？

461
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,070
㗎啦，係。

462
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,340
咧應該係照顧咗好多。

463
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:04,380
啊！但係就始終都係只係一個建築物，嚇一嚿一個block嚟到。

464
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:15,930
噉我想問，即係十億聽上去咧，即係翻新話一個非常龐大一個數目。咁可唔可以即係或者建築署啲同事可唔可以解釋下點解要咁多錢嚟用？

465
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:19,310
O.K.即係簡單嚟講，即係話誒律政司暫時未有呢方面嘅安排，以備將來需要擴充之用，即即係話將來先算噉。

466
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:57,450
我唔想用招募呢個字啦，就係誒有個新聞稿嘅。咁喺嗰個截止之前咧，誒係有誒二十五個正話文件有交代啦，二十五個團體。咁誒當時嘅公告咧嘅日子係二零一四年嘅十二月十九日嘅。咁嗰個法。

467
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:29,180
噉我諗，我講一個原則嘅要求啦嚇，即係通常有啲噉嘅咁好嘅嘢咧，咁梗係好多團體申請啦。但係，我認為係應該一定係有公眾嗰個服務嗰個性質喺度，甚至有啲你話即係漫邊嘅我誒研究啊，或者乜，我覺得你哋係因為係用呢一個大樓。

468
01:30:43,790 --> 01:31:03,800
係楊楊樂橋議員，主席唔該，其實我都係想問啲即係少少技術嘅嘢咧，因為我注意到文件其實正正係即係補充第六段，即係footnote第六段都講咗，即係我瞭解到其實律政司需要樓面面積都幾多下，咁其實嘅其實夠唔夠使？

469
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:23,810
即係一個好實際嘅問題。即係而家我注意到，即係預留咗好多空間係畀其他機構啦。咁但係因為將來咧，即係隨住我哋香港嘅發展，律政司亦都有可能係需要即係增加個編制都唔定嘅。咁到時會點樣咧？即係會係到嗰啲機構外即係租畀佢哋嗰啲機構可。

470
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:43,820
可能個租約到咗啦，咁先攞翻係咪呢個？可能係將來以備將來嘅需要啊，主席係專員係主席，我哋喺誒呢個進行呢方面嘅計劃嘅時候咧，都係好詳細咧係研究過我哋自己本身嘅需要噉，所以好似喺文件嗰個第六嗰個註釋嗰度咧，我哋亦都係解釋咗咧，就係話。

471
01:31:43,860 --> 01:32:03,870
誒當然啦，我哋律政司咧喺一九八六年其實已經係搬入咗去金鐘政府合署。咁經過咁多年嗰個發展咧，其實係人手咧係增加咗好多。咁但係咧喺個地方嘅配合咧，因為即係喺金鐘政府合署佢有有限嘅地方咧，咁所以喺嗰方面咧係相對增加地。

472
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:23,880
地方咧個配合咧係誒未未符合嗰個需求嘅，咁所以咧，我哋喺今次嗰個亦都借依個計劃咧，係誒喺西座提供地方嘅時候咧，我哋亦都有咧係預留咗咧係有三千幾平方米咧，係去我哋咧去補足翻咧以往咧我哋未能夠咧係誒。

473
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:43,920
呢個提供到咧係呢個足夠嘅地方，噉我哋希望咧由呢個噉嘅安排咧就會照顧到咧係誒律政司未來嗰個發展。即係我我想我驚我誤會主席，即係啊專員嘅意思，即係話有三千幾平方米咧係將會係就咁做後備嘅，定係已經都會使用埋。

474
01:32:45,350 --> 01:33:05,360
誒，主席，我頭先所講嗰啲咧係誒，我哋以往咧係人手有增加，但係地方未有誒適當咁增加，所以我哋嘅人手咧係需要咧係較為咧係依個緊逼或者係未符合個標準咧，而擺埋一齊咧去進行工作。咁所以咧，即係如果係我哋有。

475
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:25,370
呢啲額外三千幾平方米嘅地方咧，就會可以補足我哋現時嘅不足。明白噉，我我其實我可能我剛才問得唔好啊，主席。我嘅意思其實係將來喺未來嘅日子，因為律政司亦都可能會繼續擴充。係噉，如果當未來都唔夠空間啊，噉佢哋係咪會將嗰啲？

476
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:45,380
現時預留畀其他法律組織嘅嗰啲收翻翻嚟咧，其實我本嚟個問題係噉啊，主席。係專員。誒，主席，當我哋將來係有需要有額外嘅地方嘅時候咧，我哋係會研究咧係點樣係最適當嘅誒方法咧，係去為我哋提供嘅足夠嘅地方咧。話包括係即係睇下。

477
01:33:45,380 --> 01:34:05,390
附近仲有冇其他政府物業嘅地方咧？或者係誒有其他嘅安排噉，所以咧係依點咧暫時係即係好難，即係誒講到到時會係點樣做噉。但係咧係誒經過依個中東西座嘅工程之後咧，我哋搬咗入嚟咧，我哋喺嗰個地方嘅需求。

478
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:39,620
O.K.咁唔該，主席，其實都係一句啫。我即係當然，我哋對呢啲計劃其實我哋冇乜大意，只不過係即係準備定即係提醒定律政司，因為因為如果將來咧係畀嗰啲其他法律機構使用，其實佢哋都花好多即係資源係去做裝修啊，諸如此類。咁如果去到一段時間要收翻翻嚟嘅。

479
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:12,980
唔該。

480
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:15,720
好，第二輪副主席。

481
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:38,320
如果係講緊嗰啲誒開庭嗰啲地方咧，即係誒唔係講緊個私人嘅辦事處，嗰啲係政府畀啊嘛。

482
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:48,210
咧噉樣，你可唔可以畀一啲？因為而家你係未決定啊嘛，係嘛？我知你喺度笑啦，我知點解你喺度笑啦，但係我就想問就係，而家係未決定啊嘛，係咪？

483
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:11,510
邊係要審批？咁其中個內容裏邊咧，我哋喺個工程期間咧，亦都係要跟足呢個報告裏邊咧嘅一啲嘅要求咧，係要跟足嘅。咁所以係比一般嗰個嘅工程咧，係亦都係有啲唔同嘅。

484
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:59,630
噉我估對大家都冇好處啫。明白，即係唔該，主席，多謝意見。啊，我就如果冇人發問嘅話，我就最後就誒第一輪就想問一問，就係一個好簡單嘅問題。而家講緊係誒合署，即係誒西座嘅翻新工程，係咪？咁雖然嗰個嗰座建築物係非常之大嘅，我知道。

485
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:39,030
係誒，多謝主席。就其實成個嗰個西座工程計劃咧，先頭阿專員都講到咧，係有三方面嘅。第一方面就係個保育工程啦，就儘量咧令到成個西翼本身嗰個嘅誒大樓咧，係能夠保持翻喺一九五九年嗰個特色嘅原貌。咁第二個亦都係。

486
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:59,040
包括一個修復嘅工程，噉就將一啲本身現有同埋比較近期咧係加建一啲嘅誒誒構租物咧，係將佢可以悉心咁做安排。咁第三個咧，亦都一個比較主要少少嘅，就係我哋係改建嗰個工程咧，係例如加咗一啲即係比較係跟現時嗰個啊條例公務條例嗰個。

487
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:19,050
嘅要求，咁誒，因為本身咧成個大廈咧就係誒係因為已經係比較係舊啊，咁所以亦都本身咧條例嘅係咪噉嘅意思？誒應該咁講，我哋係永遠係誒跟一個即係儘量，如果係有機會去改建嘅時候咧，就儘量令到個大樓咧係可以符合到最新嗰個條例。咁所以本身亦。

488
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:39,060
都因為結構上咧有一啲嘅誒誒誒因素咧，會令到我哋喺工程嘅期間裏邊咧，係多比一個普通其他嘅工程裏邊咧，係多好多嘢要考慮因素嘅。嚇，咁所以我哋係用呢個工程咧，係同我哋呢個誒中東座嗰個嘅工程比較咧，係我哋覺得係夠價錢係相約嘅。係，如果係有。

489
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:59,070
有保育呢個即係element喺裏邊咧，會唔會係都係昂貴啲嘅要做保育？誒，係主席，就因為我哋本身呢一個項目咧係誒評為係呢個一級嗰個嘅誒誒誒評級咧，咁所以我哋係要交一個嘅所個嘅誒誒報告咧，係畀呢個交諮會裏。

490
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:36,500
誒，我都係想跟進翻嗰個問題，就係如果裝修嗰個錢咧，而家政府係諗住誒會花幾多錢去裝修嗰個誒國際仲裁中心嘅書樓咧，同埋係會唔會考慮畀翻香港國際仲裁中心繼續喺交易廣場去誒作為佢嘅嘅誒誒地方。

491
01:37:48,650 --> 01:38:08,660
誒主席，首先咧就係，正如陳總所講咧，我哋而家仲係做緊嗰個誒審議嘅工作啦。咁所以咧，即係唔可以誒講到咧係話，即係邊一個機構咧係到時咧係會進駐呢個法律書樓。咁但係我哋所做嗰個基本功夫咧，就係話誒，我哋咧係係。

492
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:28,670
會提供嗰個誒基本嗰個誒裝修啦。咁但係到時咧係嗰個法律相關機構咧，因為佢要配合佢自己嘅運作需要咧，可能係有佢其他嘅需求嘅。咁所以喺嗰方面咧，就會係個法律機誒相關機構咧，佢自己咧去進行誒佢誒呢個本身。

493
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,220
係啊。

494
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:10,210
令到人哋。

495
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:42,500
即係公開咗話有噉嘅。

496
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,200
我就喺呢度畫條線，好嘛？大家同意。

497
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:13,970
即係進場嘅時候咧，就會即刻攞到個服務。

498
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,010
係咪？咁如果你話唔唔講得嘅，噉你嚟做咩咧？

499
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:47,240
誒有噉嘅場地，噉佢哋就即係想盡處啦。

500
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,870
嗱，第一，即係你嚟呢度，噉我監察你，我緊係想知道你。

501
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:39,530
即係我真係好有興趣嗰廿五個團體啦。當然你話誒，即係公開。

502
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:08,550
第二，阿郭郭榮亨議員就問話：喂，如果你做做良心，要即係佢意思就係話，你做親咧，不如你用公堂去做一個更加好嘅硬件。

503
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:26,030
我唔知佢講講話，即係嗰啲人如果畀錢做咧就好啦，即係誒佢負擔唔起，我唔知係咪咁啦。咁所以其實真係有，即係邊個可以進場，邊個唔可以進場。

504
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:30,920
個服務嘅質素咧，係絕對唔會差過而家。係好，下一位係誒，或者因為時間關係，我依度畫條線。而家仲有係第二輪發言嘅梁國雄議員同埋梁美芬議員。

505
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:58,610
我哋會提供誒足夠嘅地方咧，係畀佢哋咧係進行呢方面嘅工作。但係嗰個誒一配合佢實際運作嗰個誒內部裝修咧，就係由相關機構自己負責。噉，我覺得呢個考呢個呢個配套唔係太過理想咯，因為而家你講緊嘅誒要裝修到大。

506
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:18,620
設為一個國際級一級水平嘅仲裁中心咧，花嘅錢可能係五六千萬都未定，因為你裏邊有好多設施咧，係需要係啊做得非常之好。如果你叫嗰啲仲裁中心自己去銀荷包出嚟整咧，呢個係冇可能做到嚇。咁所以如果政府係諗住真係做一個一級嘅，

507
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:38,630
仲裁中心咧，我真係希望你哋唔好慳啊啊！嗰啲裝修錢，因為如果你做得渦渦突突，或者係嗰啲誒誒設施、金屬達唔到國際水平咧，啲人唔會嚟嘅。如果你唔嚟嘅話，噉你又輸曬啲生意畀新加坡嘅啫嚇。所以我真係希望一係你畀佢留翻。

508
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:58,640
喺嗰度一係咧，如果你真係裝修嘅話咧，係做到一級水平呢個，你可唔可以承諾？誒，主席首先咧，就係每一個誒法律嘅相關機構咧，佢對於佢嘅運作需要咧誒，由於佢係提供唔同性質嘅服務咧，都所以可能有唔同嘅噉，所以我哋咧喺嗰個。

509
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:18,650
誒提供嗰個誒呢個即係喺西翼嘅時候咧，個裝修咧，好難講話係即係一概言論咧，全部咧係去達到咧係呢個某一個咧係誒專業嘅水平。咁所以咧，我哋咧係提供一個基本嘅裝修，而到實際嗰個誒工作咧就係誒由嗰個。

510
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:38,660
相關機構因應佢嘅運作咧而進行嘅。咁當然我哋明白咧，即係噉樣做咧，可能咧係誒要嗰個相關機構咧喺個運作上啊，或者財政上各方面咧係需要配合。咁所以喺依方面咧，我哋會就各個會將來咧可能有機會進駐嘅機構咧喺依方面咧點樣？

511
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:58,670
達到適當嘅安排咧，我哋會同佢哋有一個適當相對。但係你主要係想做國際仲裁㗎嘛？即係呢個其中起碼其中一個好大嘅元素啦，係咪？我理解啱啦。咁如果你做國際仲裁嘅話咧，你嘅措施一定係誒個設施一定要係做到係起碼嗰個級數。咁所以嗰個你如果你唔肯畀錢出。

512
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:18,680
嚟咧，嗰啲嗰啲誒仲裁中心係冇錢去自己做嘅嚇。噉你要明白呢一個難處咯。係佢誒，主席，我哋絕對明白呢一點嘅。我哋亦都係誒期望咧，就係話我哋誒呢啲法律相關機構咧，將來搬入去個法律書樓嗰度咧，佢所提供。

513
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,050
七年。

514
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,430
即係，我覺得其實。

515
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,630
係咩人嚟㗎？

516
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,190
委員啊！幾多位官方嘅委員？

517
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:06,280
有幾多個非官方議委員啊？係點樣輪選㗎？

518
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:02,870
你可唔可以將嗰個委員會嘅名單方唔方便啊？

519
01:44:54,710 --> 01:45:02,850
涉及咁多工廠，而啲又有涉及一個空間分配嘅時候，噉你哋係司法界嚟㗎嘛？

520
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:50,300
即係嗰咁唔透明嘅嘢，噉你嚟揾我咪即係走即係過冷河嘅啫喎！我想問你有幾多位官方嘅議員啊？

521
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:32,870
㗎嘛，咁跟住阿各各議員仲叫你話，為你做，你使多啲錢啊！如果唔係做嚟冇用，咁個你使咗大量嘅公帑㗎嘛，咁邊個入去進駐，邊個唔入去進駐？

522
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:56,310
誒，我頭先講嘅就係誒官方嘅人士咧，除咗律政司司長、律政司嘅代表咧，仲有係相關政府決策局嘅代表。

523
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:40,290
就係我哋監察，就係我哋監察嚟啊嘛！即係包括，因為你而家係律政司司長擔任主席，咁跟住咧就有關界別的非官方委員啊嘛，並且有啊嘛。咁官方委員有幾多位啊？

524
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:18,080
或者律政司係即係政府嘅代表，係大律就喺嗰度司嚟，要要行秉承秉行公義㗎嘛。咁嚟到一個立法會嘅場合，我哋都覺得有啲問題，即係你當我蠢啦，我都覺得有問題嘅時候，咁點搞啊？

525
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:26,570
誒主席喺度咧，我可以誒提供嘅資料咧，就係係主席依個嗰個委員會咧，就係律政司司長啦。佢成員咧係包括咧係律政司嘅代表啦。誒依個同埋咧係兩名以個人身份獲委任嘅成員，佢哋分別來自咧係香港大律。

526
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:46,580
師公會同埋香港律師會，同埋咧亦都有咧係其他以個人身份獲委任嘅成員嘅，來自咧係呢個相關界別或者係使用咧係法律誒相關服務嘅商界。咁呢啲咧都係誒非官方嘅人線。有幾多位啊？總共有冇官方委員？幾多一個啫？喎，而家啲事。誒。

527
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:23,160
我哋可以將個名單咧係提供畀誒依個誒委員會參考嘅。事實上咧喺依方面，我哋進行嗰個工作咧係早前亦都嚟咗委員會去匯報，就係嗰個委員會咧係採取啲咩嘢嘅誒評核嘅標準去揀選依啲法律機構咧。因為因為我點解會咁講咧？因為咧你使十億。

528
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:53,160
噉佢進駐之前可唔可以私家同你講條件？而家全部都好似發夢噉，因為佢用佢嘅講法咧，就係話你如果做得唔好嘅，做做嚟都冇用。咁嗰條友可唔可以同你講話，不如做好啲啊？又唔得，噉你又唔知揀揀邊個，噉你即係上到嚟，我哋即係即係係咁耳敏敏咯。我我。

529
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:52,920
係一咧。

530
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,380
係，專員。

531
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:25,720
佢做得幾多嘢啊？

532
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:28,290
淨係港獨嗰啲搞到佢暈啦～

533
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,770
你唔可以叫我盲信你㗎嘛？

534
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,920
好多謝。要揾條例出嚟。

535
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,040
尤其是個政司做做主席添。

536
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:37,450
好，仲有幾多嘢啊？梁美芬議員係主席，嗯。

537
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:48,310
得你哋就要即係預早去誒，能夠令到使用者咧佢安心，同埋咧，我覺得好重要就係方便同埋現代化嘅問題啦，嚇。

538
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:57,880
講翻嗰啲空間可以畀其他法律相關組織用咧，我諗我就建議律政司可以考慮係誒誒，你畀名單我哋嘅時候咧都可以誒話，你哋有啲相關嘅誒準則誒，即係將來將會係同律政司共用嗰個誒空間嘅有。

539
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:17,890
機會嚇咁咧，就我我自己估計，即係一定會包括即係調解中心啊，或者係嗰一類嘅，即係都係我我相信係誒個相關性係高嘅。但係咧就誒，我亦都同意咧。其實我同意咧，就係誒國際仲裁中心。首先我自己都申報啦，我有我我有喺。

540
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:37,900
國際仲裁中心，我亦都係誒做過佢哋仲裁嘅仲裁員啦。咁所以都有使用過。即係現時咧，其實誒，佢係喺現時嘅地址裏面，我覺得係誒相當方便嘅。咁但係如果你話誒誒，將來係誒呢度可以包括埋佢哋嗰個使用嘅機會。

541
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:57,910
咁當然係，佢係考慮到，我記得佢嚟過嘅時候就係交通嘅方便，佢有講過嚇，令到國際嘅誒使用者好容易係去到嗰度。同埋當然你話係誒嗰個誒裝修啊、設計啊，咁當然我哋係希望一定係要達到國際嘅標準，應該仲要好過新加坡，噉你先至可。

542
01:46:57,910 --> 01:47:17,920
可以競爭啦。咁但係，即係如果呢個真係喺你嘅你哋嘅考慮裡面，噉我哋就提前要提提出呢啲意見。誒係咪佢哋係使用嗰個舊誒中審法院大樓，定係佢係有機會用你哋而家即係西座嚇？咁呢個亦都係，我覺得你哋係應該考慮埋我哋今。

543
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:37,930
物委員會嘅意見就係嗰個方便性，因為去西藏係係方便啲嘅嚇，咁咧就會唔會就誒都減低咗？即係上次佢哋主席嚟呢一度提出嘅好多嘅問題誒，我哋理解佢話佢希望留翻現有嘅地方嚇，咁但係即係如果你話大家去多啲嘅溝通，我覺。

544
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:16,630
國際共仲裁中心咧嗰個聯繫咧係好緊密嘅。咁第二咧就有關誒誒呢個法律誒相關服務嘅團體呢一方面咧嗰個涵蓋面咧係必定咧係會包括咗除咗仲裁之外咧係包括埋調解嘅。咁所以呢一方面咧，誒梁議員係唔。

545
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,630
請支持嘅表態。

546
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,650
係有冇有冇人唔支持？

547
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:40,840
冇好，噉我哋係支持呢一個，我哋委員會係支持呢個議嘅翻新工程嘅。

548
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:48,110
噉就下一個事項係其他事項，我冇其他事項，我亦冇冇散會，唔該。

549
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:28,320
嘅擔心，嗯，係好，好唔該，咁OK，噉我想問一問就係誒各位委員咧，係支持定係唔支持上述嘅二二翻新工程？
