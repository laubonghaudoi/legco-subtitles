1
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,080
嗯。

2
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,600
好啊。

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,630
Good morning.

4
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
啊， producer。

5
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,490
啊嘅，噉就啊。

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,460
我哋等官員誒入嚟先，好嘛？

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,620
早晨，歡迎嘅官員同埋機管局嘅誒。

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,970
事項如有任何直接或間接金錢利益咧，應該在發言前披露有關嘅利益成質嘅。

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,980
誒以前第一項咧，我哋係講三跑道嘅客運廊同埋相關客運大樓設施。

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:08,860
人員啊入嚟啦，噉就誒，我哋今日就係講三跑道客運廊同埋相關客運大樓嘅設施嘅，或者我畀阿誒局長誒講先啊嘛。

11
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:49,930
Thank you, Chairman. Honorable members, today I'd like to introduce some of the green principles that we'll be applying to the design of the major facilities of the 3Rs project.

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:23,050
誒多謝主席，或者誒今日主要嗰個簡介咧，就係請誒機管局嘅同事可作一個介紹嘅。佢哋分別有兩位嘅同事作介紹，或者我請誒機管局嘅同事，誒Kevin。誒誒邊位？Kevin。

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:27,910
Design strategies and for the principal buildings, we will be striving for the very highest possible rating for the for the buildings and using the Hong Kong BIM Plus, which is the local environmental assessment process whereby buildings are

14
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:20,450
一夠誒法定人數，而家可以宣佈開會，或者請政府官員啊入嚟先，好嘛？噉就誒，我按議事規則，我提醒咧誒，大家就八十三一A三八十三A規定咧，各位委員就今日誒會議嘅討論。

15
00:01:50,370 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm sure members are aware that we strive at Hong Kong Airport to be one of the world's greenest airports, and for that reason, we see the 3Rs as an opportunity to further enhance our credentials in that respect. We have undertaken with our significant project to always consider some of the green.

16
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:48,200
judged, and recognising that that is the Hong Kong system is obviously based on the more normal commercial and residential buildings that are common in Hong Kong. There are challenges in in our design of these very large public space buildings, but nonetheless we're confident that we can achieve high standards. We've

17
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:58,220
Good opportunity to bring light into the building. It has a nice ambience for passengers, but also by providing light into the building, it can reduce our lighting load.

18
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:53,260
We we don't bring in too much solar heat gain from the from the light, which then of course increases the cooling load. So it's a very much a balance as we go forward with the design.

19
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:25,780
the most light into the building, reducing the lighting load, whilst limiting the amount of solar heat gain, and therefore reducing, if we can, the the the cooling load that needs for cooling the building.

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:58,890
Recently, completed the midfield concourse where we achieved a provisional gold rating, and we believe that we can do that or better with our new facilities.

21
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:52,590
And as you can see, obviously, particularly for buildings, the key features, and there are many, but they generally fall within four categories of energy efficiency, water conservation, water quality, and also waste management.

22
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:45,190
窗玻璃使用高能效、高效能的照明，所有這些考慮。再次，在水的消耗方面，我們在看海水冷卻，使用和減少飲用水。

23
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:14,810
Talk briefly on a few other major considerations. Water consumption is very key. What we're trying to do is obviously reduce the amount of potable water consumption in the building. We do this through low velocity.

24
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:09,230
Those are considered throughout each design stage, but as I said, importantly, they are also considered at a very early stage in scheme design when the project is being and the scope is being defined. Those are then carried through into detail design and through into implementation of the project.

25
00:04:45,470 --> 00:05:01,890
also air quality, indoor air quality, we strive for excellent standard, and we look at how that can be achieved, and also other aspects, including and then waste management is a very very fundamental consideration, both during the construction and also of course the operation of the building.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:38,860
Shows how we proceed. We obviously benchmark against others around the world and also in Hong Kong. And for each major facility, we establish at the outset a design strategy as to how we will achieve some of the major environmental considerations.

27
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:20,200
In the design of our major facilities, we always consider green aspects at the very beginning. It's much easier to incorporate environmental features if you've already before you before you actually finalise the form and structure of the building. So at the very process, this diagram shows.

28
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:30,530
This diagram here shows an example of work that was done at the scheme design of the third runway concourse, the TRC building, where we this shows all of the considerations we did under the major headings of, say, for instance, the energy efficiency on the left hand side. There, we're looking at solar shading, high performance.

29
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:23,000
This cross section here is is of the third runway concourse building, and just use this to illustrate a couple of design features that we focus on when when designing a building. So at the early stages, we can adjust the form of the building to provide a very efficient structure that will then

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:43,010
lead to energy reduction in the life of the building. So we're looking at the roof, the balance of the roof, whereby we get light into the middle of the building using glazing, obviously on the sides, but also if we can introduce glazing in the roof to get light down into the middle of the building, thereby reducing the lighting load. But also very careful, we need to be sure.

31
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:15,190
An example of that is we do during the design stage. We carefully engineer the building where we balance all of those components. And here's an example in the top right, a wheel of whereby tracking the sun, where where the hot areas of the building are going to be, where the most solar heat gain is going to be. And then we design our strategies and shading strategies that allow.

32
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:47,980
This is an artist's impression of the early design scheme design and the the third runway concourse. Because of one ear, one part of it is very very wide indeed. We're looking at the opportunity that provides us to introduce a green area within the building by providing a landscape courtyard. That also gives us again a

33
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,840
嗯。

34
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,410
誒誒，吳生。

35
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,320
and obviously that greywater can also be used, as I say, for irrigation and other aspects.

36
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,390
On innovation, I just like to now pass over my colleague C.K.

37
00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:01,140
有效地利用呢個創新科技，提升呢個旅客嘅體驗，同埋進一步加強同埋提升機場嘅營運嘅效率。

38
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:33,010
The building, and also strictly follows the indoor requirements, looking for an excellent indoor quality environment.

39
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:39,610
Also, of course, our APM system is electrical. But also, we we have a design that will use regenerative braking. So again, as the as the train brakes, it feeds electricity back into the system.

40
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:46,770
We also consider careful use of materials. We try and use competence where we can. Where we use wood, we tend to specify that those must be coming from a sustainable source.

41
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:35,420
fittings for the the sinks and the and the showers and also of course cooling is a crucial energy consumer and therefore as we have with terminal one and other facilities we're looking obviously at providing where we can seawater for cooling we will also then harvest.

42
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:55,430
Grey water, as we do in existing building, by harvesting the grey water that's coming from the sinks and and the non foul areas of the building, where that water is collected, it's treated and then can be reused either for irrigation or in we're looking at opportunities to use that water for even the washing of aircraft on the apron.

43
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:23,610
Air quality, indoor air quality is very important and can be achieved by careful selection of materials at the design stage and implementation, so that we can reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds that are in the designs. These are for things like paints, surface finishes. By reducing that, it improves the the air quality at the outset.

44
00:08:47,050 --> 00:09:07,060
And we show there in in the paragraph number five. There's a picture of our electrical vehicles. This is something we've been incorporating at the airport for some time. Our saloon vehicles for the airport authority that go airside have been electric for some years, and we are progressively introducing that for all of our business partners for the saloon vehicles, and.

45
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:27,070
Of course, that's got to be implemented through lots of electrical charging stations, and we've been implementing that, and will continue to implement in the coming years and in the 3Rs project, to allow the maximum use of electrical vehicles and also possibly electrical ground support equipment for the aircraft movements.

46
00:09:42,940 --> 00:10:02,950
Lastly, is waste. We appreciate that waste is a major concern for Hong Kong, and therefore we're very keen that both the design of the facility, as it as it stands, for its use, maximises the opportunity for recycling and reuse of waste with the operation of the building.

47
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,110
自動式嘅機械臂。

48
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,910
去支持呢啲科技方面嘅發展嘅。

49
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,040
好啦，要建做一個啊智能嘅機場咧，香港機場就需要提升同埋改善現有嘅智能嘅基礎。

50
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:29,410
噉我有個video畀大家啊睇一睇，噉你會見到咧呢個速度係非常之快嘅，係每啊ten second係do kilometres。

51
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:11,450
複雜啊！有效地利用呢個創新科技去提升呢個旅客嘅服務同埋體驗啊，營運嘅效率咧，係一定一個必然嘅大方向㗎啦。

52
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:19,330
必然嘅誒趨勢㗎啦。喺三排系統方面咧，我哋咧係會誒喺呢個誒行李輸送系統方面咧，係更加將佢改善，去增建一個叫高速獨立嘅行李嘅輸送嘅系統嘅。

53
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:48,970
啦，學術界同埋科技界嘅專業人才等等咧，去帶領同埋推廣科技同埋創新嘅發展，為香港未來嘅科技同埋創新方面咧，提供多啲意見。同一時間咧，機管局亦都成立咗一個香港國際機場科技創新基金。

54
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:51,780
好啦，咁好啦，行李輸送系統快咧，但係去到呢一個行李地方，呢個啊，主場大堂咧，我哋需要咧，亦都需要人力去將佢拎落嚟嘅。喺呢一方面咧，我哋機場管理局咧，亦都喺舊年咧，係成功地咧，係試用咗一啲叫做啊。

55
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:22,960
But also during construction stage, we'll be trying to minimise and reduce waste, and where we can, we'll be looking to recycle and reuse materials. Again, in recent experience on the midfield concourse just recently completed, we were able to use a significant number of materials that used percentages of recycled materials.

56
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:53,530
啊！主席，各位議員，啊，我啊會用以下嘅時間咧，同啊講講香港國際機場嘅創新同埋科技方面嘅作出一個簡介。喺創新同埋呢個科技方面咧，機管局嘅遠景係希望能夠將機香港機場咧係打成造成一個智能嘅機場。

57
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:21,580
去實踐一個智能嘅機場咧，我哋係需要咧啊，制定一啲有關嘅啊啊科技嘅發展路線圖，同埋啲執行嘅指引，去更加有效地去推行呢一個所有嘅啊啊program去配合呢一個智能機場方面嘅發展。咁喺呢一方面咧，機管局。

58
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:41,590
其實咧就喺呢個誒二零一五年咧，已經成立咗一個誒委員會去突察呢一個智能機場嘅發展嘅啦。隨着呢個誒科技一日千里，日日日新月異，創新科技發展方面咧，新一代嘅旅客咧對呢一個體驗啊，對呢個服務啊，誒對。

59
00:11:41,590 --> 00:12:01,600
其他嘅個人方面嘅要求咧，同舊一代咧已經好唔同㗎啦。而家咧，佢哋需要咧，希望係快又要準，仲話隨時隨地都可以上到網嘅。咁加上呢個航空業咧，係一個分秒必爭。香港機場作為呢個全球一個最繁忙嘅機場咧，我哋嘅日常嘅操作只會更加。

60
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:31,740
咁好似頭先啊，文件裏邊嘅第三十一至三十三段咧，我哋亦都詳述咗機管局喺舊年年初咧就特別成立咗呢個香港機場科技創新委員會，同埋一啲諮詢委員會同其他一啲架構，係特別咧啊，邀請咗行界方面嘅代表啦，呢個研發專家。

61
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,950
好啦，噉我哋而家啊第一代嘅cast咧，我哋逐步咧係會將佢哋replace㗎啦。

62
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:23,160
商等等，亦都同一時間咧，開創咗呢一個方面嘅工種，係畀一啲啊女性嘅工作或者退休嘅人士方面。

63
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:27,290
好希望喺適當嘅時間、適當嘅地點，得到好多個人化諮詢同埋呢個服務。噉我哋喺呢方面亦都可以提供得到㗎啦。

64
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:46,810
調配我哋啲員工咧，去推多啲行去行李車，去畀嗰啲旅客嘅使用。咁喺呢一方面咧，我係好一個好簡單嘅簡介噉啊！多謝各位。好啊，誒。

65
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:17,930
Departure啦，你而家離開呢度咧需要八分鐘，希望你能夠快啲去呢個boarding機上機啦，等等方面。噉我哋亦都係希望咧能夠做到呢一方面嘅嘢嘅。噉啊，旅客咧亦都係。

66
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:46,980
辦理嘅登機呢個啊手續方面咧，係能夠將而家大約兩至三分鐘嘅時間縮短到係大約一分鐘左右。喺呢一方面咧，呢一個啊研發咧，係我哋香港機場同埋我哋嘅業務夥伴大家合作，所以我哋而家亦都申請緊一個專業嘅patent喺度嘅。

67
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:23,330
啊！機管局現在正在咧逐步把一啲誒，把一啲咧係獨立嘅資訊科技嘅網絡連接埋一齊啊。去到呢個機場嘅主要網絡，機管局亦都將會成立一個物聯網，我哋叫做Internet of Things咧，引入啲新嘅技術啊，例如呢個信標嘅技術啦，ibicon啊，進一步將。

68
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:43,340
因為real time嘅information，即係實時嘅資訊咧，係全面性去結合，讓一啲員工能夠更加靈活去工作，作出工作上嘅決定，同埋改善呢一個旅客喺機場嘅體驗嘅。機管局係希望透過加強呢個機場嘅智能嘅基建咧，創新科技方面嘅誒。

69
00:13:43,340 --> 00:14:03,350
發展咧係達到四個目的嘅，第一係自動化，第二係流動個人化，第三係自助化，第四咧係高效率化。喺機場嘅日常嘅操作裏邊咧，我哋係十分依賴呢個人力方面，所以如果能夠改善呢個營運能力咧，自動化係一個。

70
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:15,400
去幫助呢啲操作員咧，係能夠更加有效率地將一啲重嘅行李或者所有嘅行李咧，由呢個啊行李輸送大道放落呢個行李車，然後再拖出去外出。喺呢一方面咧，我哋可以減少咗你員對員工呢個體力嘅需求啦，減少呢個因為工傷而發展嘅背痛啊，或者咧扭。

71
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:45,070
好啦，喺流動同埋個人化方面咧，好似頭先我所講啦，大部分嘅旅客而家都希望能夠喺機場咧，係儘量咧能夠自己做一啲自己中意做嘅嘢啦。簡單啲嚟講，我哋喺呢一個啊機場嘅Hong Kong AirBook My Flight方面咧，航班裏邊咧，我哋係提

72
00:15:45,070 --> 00:16:05,080
提供好多個人化嘅啊服務嘅。第一，佢可以做呢個諮詢啦。我哋都可以提示呢個旅客啊幾時去boarding啦啊呢班機喺邊一個位置boarding啦。第三加埋啲ibm咧，我哋將來亦都可以預測到咧。我哋可以話畀你聽啊，某某先生，你而家咧嚟啊呢班機將會十分鐘之內咧就嚟啊。

73
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:48,220
好啦，喺呢一個國際啊航空協會嘅調查，二零一四年咧，佢哋亦都發覺到咧，大部分超過七十五個percent嘅國際旅客都希望能夠咧多一啲自助嘅服務。所以我哋咧喺機場咧，香港國際機場亦都提供多好多自助嘅服務。啊，喺呢個圖片裏邊咧，你會見到我哋。

74
00:16:48,220 --> 00:17:08,230
有好多嘅叫做啊查詢航班資料啊，呢個係好簡單，你只係將你張boarding pass一tap落去咧，佢就即刻可以話畀你睇乜機啊，準唔準時起飛啊？喺邊個位啊？邊個啊登機位置啊？同埋呢一個時間係點樣啊？亦都有呢一個所謂嘅iCast呢一個影張相裏邊，呢個係。

75
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:28,240
舊㗎啦，我哋而家新個代咧有一個流動式嘅iClass，亦都有一個叫做啊自助式嘅啊託運行李嘅設施。我哋而家已經係裝咗喺呢個香港國際機場某啲坑塔裏邊。喺今年年內，我哋裝多一百多多部嘅呢一個係將我哋平時旅客去呢個機場。

76
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,370
電氣化、電動化。

77
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,460
好啊，邊位答啊？阿馮生。

78
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,980
起碼中小型嗰啲咧，全變係。

79
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,070
有冇任何嘅措施做呢一個碳補償？

80
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:47,920
嘅charging point啊，包括咗我哋最新開呢個中場，亦都有呢個足夠嘅啊充電器畀呢啲噉嘅啊電車去去使用嘅。嗱，我追問翻關於嗰個氫。

81
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:18,960
買credit就係放水啫，咁成喺成個設計嗰度，點解有冇啲即係common即係offsetting嘅嘅措施咧？噉樣樣好啊！誒，邊位答到？

82
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:18,300
包括環保同埋創新嘅設施，我想問問你哋咧，喺設計嘅過程裏邊咧，有冇計算過整個三跑咧會增加太排太排放碳排放幾多？

83
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:55,890
噉就誒，但係我相信嗰個mileage誒唔會話超高，同埋你日日都可能會有空間去畀佢做叉電。你哋有冇諗過三跑嘅時候，機場內部嘅運作啊，全半所有汽車？

84
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:17,250
買房量咧，演出個cost，如果喺個限市場上邊咧，係值幾多錢？我哋做過呢個研究，但係我哋未作為一個copy，我未作為一個決定話，我哋將會去去買caping credit，因為呢個係一個好重大嘅決定，我哋詳細研究先得嚇。阿吳生。

85
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:43,140
去向佢提交，誒整個碳排放咧，包括埋我哋將來三跑去到佢嘅所謂嘅終極嘅嗰個流量所產生嘅碳啦，同埋嗰個碳排放，如果市場係需要誒誒要買，所謂嘅所謂嘅carbon credit係要幾多錢咧？所謂carbon cost係幾多咧？我哋有計算過嘅嚇。

86
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:14,950
好啦，喺呢一個更高效率嘅方面咧，我哋係亦都會咧啊喺呢個啊行李方面做出好多嘅改善啊。各位如果喺外地翻嚟香港嘅時候，多數咧喺到行李呢個輸送大堂嘅裏邊咧，係需要揼嘅行李。我哋呢，希望能夠利用咗呢一個音頻。

87
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:35,070
呢個RFID咧，能夠可以喺將來不久嘅將來咧，係話畀你聽。啊，乜乜先生，你嘅行李已經到咗呢個行李輸送帶㗎啦。噉啊，另外一方面，機場嘅操作係越嚟越複雜。噉我哋亦都係啊，準備啊加設咗一個叫做機場協同嘅決策，簡單啲喺英文就叫。

88
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:55,080
A、C、D、M呢一個決策咧，係一個好重要嘅啊啊system嚟嘅，就係將所有嘅航機升降同埋呢一個movement成一個process flow咧，係分開唔同嘅階段，令到有關所有嘅業務夥伴可以同一時間咧入咗佢所有需要嘅資料，然後我就可以好清晰。

89
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:15,090
知道呢班機準唔準時，能唔能夠準時離開香港等等。噉啊喺呢一個機場，頭先我同事亦都潘先生亦都講過啦。我哋亦都係用咗好多呢個叫GBS喺所有三千幾部嘅啊電動車裏邊咧，我哋亦都有嘅GBS嘅設計。呢個亦都好重要。點解咧？因為我

90
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:35,100
我哋可以同一時間知道曬所有車喺機場嘅操作嘅環境，佢有冇派車去serve呢班機飛機啊？舉例一個例子。噉啊，另外方面亦都利用一啲叫smart C C T V做啲影像分析嘅啊，可以令到我知道咧啊，行李車喺呢個位置唔夠咯。噉我哋就即即刻會。

91
00:19:47,220 --> 00:20:07,230
局長有冇嘢補充？啊，主席啊，冇補充啦。啊，我歡迎咧，議員咧係提出佢哋嘅訊問或者畀我哋意見，我哋嚇。好啊。嗯，我而家有誒七位誒同事誒發問啦。誒八位九位，一人四分鐘啊，連問連答啊，先用佳言。多謝主席。嗱，呢啲今日嘅powerpoint咧就話包。

92
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:42,440
即係你哋營運咗之後咧嚇，營運即係full operation之後咧，你嗰個嘅即係carbon emission會增加咗幾多嚇？有冇做一啲碳補償嘅設施？第二第二個問題咧就係我見到有電動車啦，因為機場嗰個營運咧啲車都都都都都有行有裏邊有好多車嘅。

93
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:25,980
誒或者我搭一搭個誒碳排放嗰度，跟住我會請同事傾傾講嗰個汽車方面。誒，我哋喺誒評估成個誒三跑呢個項目嘅時候咧，其實我哋大概幾年前咧，我哋請咗顧問公司咧就做咗一個全面嘅三跑嘅帶嚟碳排放嘅研究。因為今日我哋就冇帶呢個智慧喺度，如果會後有需要嘅話，可以。

94
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,920
係。

95
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,010
陳鑑林要。

96
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,670
係咪？哦，陳建波，陳建波，陳建波議。

97
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,620
會諗過一個做法，要做一啲即係做offsetting啦。

98
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:14,690
我哋係咩情況之後咧，我哋係會買嗰啲carbon credit去offset。但係整個營運嚟講係一個好大嘅決定，呢個我哋會遲一步，我哋要先詳細考慮下。請問問議員。

99
00:21:43,420 --> 00:22:03,430
誒，至於車方面，我當車啊，有兩部分嘅碳排放同碳補償，有冇做呢個碳carbon compensation？誒，我哋冇，我哋冇未為呢個誒，未為我哋誒所謂嘅碳排放作出補償。我只係計算過，即係如果我哋真係誒會營運到三跑嘅終極嘅話咧，會產生幾多碳嘅排放量，同埋啲碳。

100
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:37,620
係，頭先個問題就係嗰啲自動車方面。其實機場管理局喺呢個兩兩年前咧已經開始全面性咧係將嗰啲saloon car，即係嗰啲客車，全部係將佢自動化。噉我哋去到二零一七年咧，喺機場所有呢啲車全部都會自動係用電㗎啦。噉啊，另外一方面咧，我哋喺三跑裏邊亦都預咗所有。

101
00:22:48,200 --> 00:23:08,210
排放嗰度，你做過研究啦。咁誒，當然你要畀啲資料我哋啦，嚇，即係in summary form都好啦，嚇，即係唔需要full report嘅都得。但係，但係我都好奇怪，今日你講呢啲誒環保措施，點解你唔講埋呢一部分咧？噉樣樣噉就但係你補補誒畀翻我哋。但係點解你哋唔做嗰啲即係碳補償？即係當然咧，你當你你買。

102
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:41,260
誒，今今日我哋嗰個簡介嘅重點咧，其實就係頭先阿阿潘先生已經解釋過啦。其實我喺整個機場設計由設計開始，我哋已經盡量減低嗰個碳嘅排放嗰個情況，所以係從嘅設計開始都要都要認。我知嗰個reduction，即係嗰個係減少啫，減少完之後你都會增加㗎嘛。係啊，嚇噉你有冇？

103
00:23:45,790 --> 00:24:05,800
嗱，我offset嗰度咧就主要而家市場上邊咧都係做緊嗰個carbon offset，都係靠買carbon credit offset嗰個carbon emission嘅。我哋機構咧內部有一個好細規模嘅一個一個scheme一個計劃，就係我哋就本身有有做，譬如我哋基金局誒舉辦某一啲活動嘅時候咧，我哋一個中央嘅處理去決定。

104
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:43,210
就誒對嗰個行李搬運系統咧，即係個改善，梗係非常之關注。因為以前咧係好多工傷係發生嘅，令到咧係誒好多處理系統嘅工人咧都即係都工傷多到咧變咗有啲公司都係即係搬送公司都有好大虧損。咁但係我諗虧損又冇問題，而係反而係就係嗰啲工人咧受傷，令到好多人。

105
00:24:43,210 --> 00:25:03,220
都唔肯做噉。我睇到你文短第廿五廿五段嘅，即係嗰度咧就係有講到咧，就係話而家會用呢啲誒機械去搬啦。噉我就頭先你都睇到誒嗰啲搬運嘅方法，咁真係可以對嗰個工人咧有嗰個對健康有好大嘅保障。我想希望，因為你呢個系統會喺二零一六一七年咧係會係。

106
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:23,230
誒推行嘅噉，我想你到時咧係將來係有機會喺呢個會報告翻個工商意外率嘅改變啊，即係由由而家幾多嘅啊咁噉，你用咗之後嗰個係幾多嘅咁呢個方法？如果係可行咧，將來都可以畀香港其他係即係搬運誒大件行李嘅嘅嘅公司去處理，即係希望都造福到。

107
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:43,240
所有工人令到佢哋咧係能夠嗰個身體健康更加好啲啦嚇。呢個第一點啊，第二點我想問咧，就係話你嗰個行李嘅追蹤系統當然好啦，即係我哋亦都係香港係最佳機場啦。但係好多時啲旅客咧好擔心就唔喺香港，而係你個行李去到外地嘅時候，特別係去到一啲比較即係人人力多或者個管理唔係咁好嘅地方咧。

108
00:25:43,660 --> 00:26:03,670
噉就會令到咧，你行件唔變個行李唔變咗，其實你係好焦急嘅嚇。噉我想問一問啊，你呢邊做得好啫，人哋做得唔好，噉你一樣有問題。我想問一問你會唔會有啲嘢係能夠做到咧，令香港出發嘅行李去到嗰個到達嗰個地點嘅機場咧，都能夠係令佢哋係提升佢嗰個，無論係我哋收即係去到當地收嘅。

109
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,230
遺失嘅依個可能性。

110
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:33,030
terminal嗰啲旅客係咪都係去翻而家現有嗰個terminal做出入境？如果係嘅，

111
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:48,860
誒嗰個安排會係點樣樣咧？因為我哋人手方邊啊、地方方邊咧，我相信你哋都要去重新設計嘅。咁誒，如果等咧太耐咧，乘客咧就會鼓譟嘅啦。嚇，多謝主席。誒，邊位？

112
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:48,590
lighting energy needed to light that building, so we get a very high standard of lighting, natural lighting which is a better ambience for people, whilst also reducing the energy. and also we've used, as we have with Terminal One, a lot of very very energy efficient lighting. so we have significantly reduced the the energy we use for lighting.

113
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:23,680
收嗰個行李咧，或者係個準確性咧、時間性咧，誒，甚至要揾到自己行李係有啲咩、有啲咩措施可以即係強化咗呢一方面嘅嘅情況咧？好啊，邊位答？誒誒，總裁，多謝阿陳宇呢個問題。誒，我哋依家喺香港誒國際機場咧，我哋第一步誒希望。

114
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:43,690
能夠係能夠追蹤到誒我哋啲行李咧，依個可以話誒喺世界上都係首創。我哋都喺事實上，依家機場所有機場都未有話點樣能夠誒追蹤到行李，佢只係靠個巴曲，佢只係能夠知道應該擺個件行李應該去到誒邊個機場。噉我哋依家希望第一步做到咧，就利用。

115
00:26:43,690 --> 00:27:03,700
用咗我哋嗰所謂嘅無線射頻咧，就將來如果誒嗰啲誒旅客咧係用咗我哋畀佢嗰個標籤嘅話咧，至少我哋機場將來佢翻嚟嘅時候咧，我可以咧追蹤到佢嗰個誒行李。咁其實下一步我哋依家推動緊咧，就亦都世界機場好多，你希望推動呢個合作，就將來大家都會取。

116
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:23,790
嗱，類似嘅一個噉樣嘅標準。咁如果噉嘅話咧，將來至少第一步咧就係行李嘅追蹤咧就會容易啲。咁呢個技技術其實我講亦都唔係話咩新，大家知道依家做誒即係Courier Service咧，依樣已經做到㗎啦。咁但係實際上依啲行李咧就未做到依樣。如果將來第一步大家先能夠知道個行李去咗邊，其實往往去。

117
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:43,800
到外國咧，就呢件行李誒冇到或者唔知去咗邊嘅話咧，就根本上連件行李去邊都未必知道。當然誒，追蹤到件行李唔表示件行李一定咧就係會到時去到個機場嘅時候咧得到適當嘅處理。咁呢個涉及到咧各個機場喺呢方面嘅嗰個處理行李嘅嗰個。

118
00:27:43,800 --> 00:28:03,810
誒政策同埋嗰個態度，噉我估咧就好難要求個個機場都會喺呢方面達到同一個標準。但係至少如果我哋能夠第一步做到誒，我哋首先能夠追蹤到我哋嘅行李先，下一步將來推動所有機場都用類似噉嘅標準，大家都能夠追蹤到個行李嘅話咧，我相信會減少咗誒行李。

119
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:26,300
係啊！我想少少跟進咧，有少少時間，即係係啦，即係如果誒香港方面能夠令到佢都知道人喺邊度咧，譬如話，可能嗰件行李根本就喺香港，咁咧就爭好遠啊！因為好多時佢根本都淨喺度花時間，就係揾嗰件行李，揾到之後再送，咁變咗。如果呢個系統能夠全球應用，我諗亦都係好事嘅。係啊，林建豐業。

120
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:47,220
主席，啊，最近啊啊啊，首先，主席，我宣佈，我係機管局嘅成員。噉啊，最近啊，機管機場咧就有個新嘅terminal落成啦，咁啦，亦都開始投入使用。噉啊，依個亦都係響設計方面咧，我都聽到啊。

121
00:28:47,220 --> 00:29:07,230
一啲誒誒feedback啦，都係講得好嘅啊！響設計運作嗰方面，雖然唔係係響個主流直接連接嘅，咁但係運作方面咧都好好。咁誒，響呢個新嘅terminal嗰個設計方面咧，誒，我都留意到咧啊！

122
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:27,240
響多方面咧，都係有考慮嘅。響環保嗰方面咧，咁所以我想問一問幾個問題嗱，即係首先要多啲光線，好多時咧，人哋又擔心喂用電嗰度會唔會多咗啊？咁誒，你文件嗰度其實介紹嗰度都有講到，咁但係嗰個誒。

123
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:47,250
啊，實質上嗰個光線多咗，啊，響電力嗰方面嘅消耗會多咗幾多咧？即係合唔合乎呢個經濟原則咧？噉啊，可唔可以講講畀我哋聽咧？咁另外咧，就響可啊海水冷卻嗰部分咧，其實我哋睇到響啊東。

124
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,400
一。

125
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,140
有少少意見。

126
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,100
好啊，副主席。

127
00:35:52,470 --> 00:36:09,750
我哋都唔係話啊，喺呢個會議之前就之後就唔會做。其實嗰個過程一路都會做落去嘅啊。不過我哋去到誒下個禮下個月嘅時候咧，我哋有一個好嘅機會咧，同大家作一個噉嘅啊較為詳細一個交流同討論噉嘅樣嘅。好嘅，噉我等待你哋嘅回覆啦。

128
00:29:47,250 --> 00:30:07,260
九啦，都係有一個中央冷卻系統嘅。咁但係將來如果係用一個冷卻系統，係咪可以整個機場度都可以用埋呢個冷卻系統咧？有冇噉嘅考慮咧？噉啊，嗰個運輸系統咧，就我亦都想問一問，響啟德機場搬去新機場嗰嗰陣時咧，因為係用一個全新嘅設

129
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:27,270
設計亦都出現咗一個混亂嘅噉。第日將來舊嘅同新嘅係唔係都要用一個誒相同？會唔會用一個相同嘅系統？如果唔係嘅，點樣去配合兩個系統嘅運作咧？咁最後就係嗰個入境嗰度噉。將來誒terminal誒第嗰嗰個新嘅。

130
00:30:49,310 --> 00:31:09,320
Mr. Pool, thank you, Chairman. Thank you for the question. In respect to lighting, as I pointed out, it's a balance between getting as much natural light into the building to reduce the lighting load, at the same time avoiding the solar heat gain, which then puts up the energy that you need for cooling the building.

131
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:29,330
And terminal one is a beautiful building, and is in fact itself a very efficient building. With the midfield concourse, as Mr Lambert pointed out, has just recently been opened. We were very pleased that we've further refined that design. We managed to get a lot more light into the middle of the building, and so we've significantly reduced the actual the.

132
00:31:48,870 --> 00:32:08,880
At the same time, having a very very efficient cooling system, Terminal One uses seawater for cooling, and with that system, we also pump water around other buildings in the airport, the original airport, to use seawater cooling, which is by far the most efficient. With the midfield, it was slightly more remote, and so we actually managed to.

133
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:28,890
reuse the grey water and condensate, so we're not using potable water. But again, we're using a water cooled system, which again is very, very energy efficient. And with new technologies, we've managed to get again significant energy savings in the midfield compared with a normal building, building energy code building that's common in Hong Kong, and also compared with the the.

134
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:52,380
多謝主席。主席喺問問題之前咧，我想用呢個機會跟進一下咧。其實誒，你知道我三月七號咧寫過一封信咧，係追問關於財政嗰個好多嘅問題嘅。其實誒，之前你嗰啲答案咧係解答唔到我哋有好多嘅問題咧，仲未答嘅。咁其實我想講。

135
00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:12,390
清楚咧，就係我哋唔係話開完一次會咧，就當解決咗個問題嘅。如果係有繼續有問題，係你未答嘅話咧，我哋只會繼續去追問，只會繼續去開會。呢個肯定係我哋嘅態度。我想好清楚咁講清講清楚呢一個係我哋做事嘅方針。同埋咧，我記得譬如喺十一月嘅。

136
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:32,400
嘅時候開會咧，啊主席，你曾經講過誒，就話啊，sorry，行行政總裁咧曾經講過咧，就話誒，譬如喺空空場啊、空域嘅問題上邊咧，你希望議員咧留翻啲問題遲啲你先去解答，但係遲到幾時咧？嗱，而家三月啦，咁上年十一月嘅時候你咁講。

137
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:52,410
噉你幾時可以再翻嚟答一啲關於空域嘅問題咧？呢個我亦都係好想清楚知道，因為啊就住財政狀況、就住空域呢啲問題咧，其實呢啲係好重要嘅。咁仍然有好多問題未解答。噉我想你畀一畀個啊啊而家一個答覆，你幾時可以翻嚟再答呢啲問題？誒，我或者我先。

138
00:33:52,410 --> 00:34:12,420
講講頭先誒郭議員嗰個問題咧，其實每一次誒響呢個會開完之後咧，議員提嘅問題咧，我哋需要跟進，我哋都好認真咁去跟進嘅。噉我哋係收到阿郭議員嘅封信，我哋會盡快咧就再誒提供誒個需需要嘅答案。咁誒，如果我哋提供答案你唔滿意嘅話，我哋會盡量再可以提供你足夠嘅資。

139
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,340
地點啊，要去嘅時候咧，應該坐啲咩交通工具？盧偉國議員，誒多謝主席。

140
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:21,920
通過誒機場嘅一啲誒設誒誒設施啦，或者通通過手機咧，都可以攞得到嘅咧，噉樣第一個問題先啦。好啊，誒邊偉達。

141
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:33,810
嚟到香港咧，誒就會覺得喺我哋機場不但只係考慮會好咧，同埋覺得係方便咧，同埋進一步咧能夠等我哋更加知道咧，就整體香港其他誒嘅嗰啲誒。

142
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:32,430
醫療響呢方面嚟講，我哋絕對無意咧，就係話希望話開完個會就就算數。因為我亦都好想大家係更加清楚知道整個誒三跑，無論喺設計冇無論財政安排方面嘅一啲一啲即係情況係點樣咁誒。有關財務安排嘅嘅嗰啲資料咧，我哋會盡快誒答阿各議員㗎啦。

143
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:52,440
主要誒有關空域度啊，我估誒阿副局會會解答。誒郭議員，誒我諗兩點啊。你第一點就係誒，我相信我誒依依作為議員咧，誒你有任何嘅問題咧提出嚟，我相信亦都唔單止可以喺呢個會議上高啦，啊喺其他或者呢直接覺得啊有咩問題需要各方或者係誒基。

144
00:34:52,440 --> 00:35:12,450
用過作答覆嘅，其實我哋都願意去配合嘅啊，所以唔侷限於淨係呢個會議本身嘅場合。當然喺呢個會場合，你問嘅問題咧，我哋一定會努力咧去作出回答嘅。誒，至於你第二個問題咧，就關於個空場空域咧，如果主席容許嘅話咧，我哋都想喺下個下一次嘅會議裏邊咧，即係四個會議裏邊咧，係對呢個空場空域嘅問題上高咧。

145
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:32,460
係同大家作一個交代嘅，即係你會有文件嚟嘅。我哋會會做我哋嘅功夫下，即係會比上一次更加詳盡。因為上一次你話我哋好多問題就未問得住，因為你仲同內地嘅一啲局方啊傾緊。咁而家你係咪可以再進一步畀一個誒更加詳細嘅嘅文件畀我哋咧？就住空域空。

146
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:52,470
誒，有關於空場空域嘅情況咧，我哋特登係誒希望有一個啊一節嘅，即係好似今日噉樣有一節比較詳細嘅，等大家集中喺嗰度可以問各方面同呢個空場空域有關嘅問題。咁為咗呢個討論嚟講咧，我哋事前咧我哋都會有文件咧係畀議員作為參考嘅。至於同內地嘅溝通咧，其實我。

147
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:31,430
主席，我我想即係正話啊，佢啊A A A同埋局長咧都未回應我啲問題，噉我就唔想講到你。我我講一句啫，即係我就唔想話拉布。我希望佢可以書書面咧係提供有關嘅資料畀我咁解。要小榮言誒，多謝主席誒，就誒提升誒。

148
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:51,440
誒呢個流動個人服務化方面咧，誒我睇過有關嘅資料，因為講嘅比較多咧，就係出發嘅旅客嘅一啲服務嘅安排，但係抵達誒呢個香港之後嘅旅客嗰個安排上咧，就見到唔係太多嘅介紹。咁大家知道香港其實誒嗰個作為國際，

149
00:36:51,440 --> 00:37:11,450
國際機場咧個中轉服務咧做得都係唔錯嘅。誒，我先申報咗先，我喺我哋公司喺機場又有提供巴士同埋簽證嘅服務嘅啊。咁喺呢方面咧，我覺得係唔係未來嘅機場咧，或者而家機場可唔可以提誒增加或者係進一步提升對抵達旅客同埋中轉旅客誒呢？

150
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:31,460
諮詢方面嘅一啲誒有關嘅誒服務咧噉樣誒，其實我都同機管局都提過啲意見嘅誒，好多嘅旅客其實停留喺香港時間等，即係到咗香港佢就唔係即刻走啊，或者唔嚟香港誒作為一個目的地去中轉其他地方喺呢段時間咧，佢哋可以喺香港咧。

151
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:51,470
其實喺機場消費，亦可以出嚟大嶼山消費㗎嘛。咁喺呢方面，誒，如果我哋嗰個資訊能夠清晰啲，誒多啲嘅畀行人知道，譬如將來我能夠提供一啲誒接送服務喺大嶼山去呢個三六零啊，去呢個誒呢個迪士尼啊。誒咁呢方面啊，變咗增加對香港個旅遊方面嘅資。

152
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,290
Mr.Pool。

153
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,180
啊，鄧家彪員。

154
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:29,860
發生噉，所以我我特別關心你所講話嗰個自動化嘅問題。第一咧就係。

155
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,120
Between the the two concourses and also within the whole system T1 to T2.

156
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:49,490
個嗰個復原咁廣大嘅話咧，就呢一方面嗰個節穩咧係更加重要嘅。係咪可以簡單咧都畀我知道你哋而家概念係點樣？好啊。

157
00:37:51,470 --> 00:38:11,480
資訊之外，有誒提升大嶼山嘅一啲嘅誒誒旅遊方面嘅配套啦，噉樣咁同時咧就誒我哋頭先講過，我哋嘅中轉服務咧做得比較好啊，尤其是巴士同船嘅中轉咧，係其他機場誒少有嘅。咁呢方面嘅資訊，將來可唔可以亦喺誒有關嘅啲資料方面咧，通旅客抵達之後？

158
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:42,620
問題啦，噉啊，好多謝啊葉葉議員提依個問題。咁確實咧，其實我哋依家提供嘅依一個即係依家一啲誒誒，可以話係資訊嘅基建嘅平台咧，將來咧對於好多中轉嘅旅客咧一樣適用嘅，即係包括咗去到響我哋機場入邊誒有啲誒，即係點樣虛擬嘅嘅路標嘅指。

159
00:38:42,620 --> 00:39:02,630
事啊等等，呢啲都係希望令到就係中轉嘅一啲旅客咧，喺喺方面會更加誒方便。誒噉，我哋都會咧對於到達嘅旅客咧，我哋希望通過咗依個誒我哋嘅嗰個流動平台啊等等嘅資訊咧，能夠畀佢更加多嘅資訊，包括咗將來咧就或者佢嚟到我哋機場之後誒坐巴士啊等等。

160
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:22,640
嘅個情況咧都可以通過咧，就係個手機同埋其他嘅一啲平台咧，可以係做到。因為今次時間關係咧，我哋就冇辦法向一次過咧就向大家咧就介紹我哋未來嗰幾年會推出嘅各種嘅唔同嘅一啲服務。誒，包括咗有時誒中轉咧，就往往咧就依家誒我哋覺得誒要做好啲嘅話咧，甚至

161
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:42,650
咧就唔需要完全一定去到登記到櫃位，就可以通過咗誒。依家一啲誒科技嘅嘅嗰個平台咧，嚟去響嗰個轉機嘅時候咧，就個時間啊同埋速度可以增加。噉我哋甚至咧就將來嚟講咧，就響誒海外咧就係誒買埋機票嘅時候咧，就可以連甚至連埋船車一套咁可以誒。

162
00:39:42,650 --> 00:40:02,660
喺嗰個就係手機平台都可以買到，令到佢更加方便。誒，我哋甚至咧就係誒依家咧開發緊一個誒一個軟件咧，就將來咧就去到誒機場坐的士嘅一啲誒旅客，我哋咧就會係可以做到咧，就每一人上車之前咧就派一張紙仔畀佢，就會將個。

163
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:22,670
個的士嘅號碼同埋去到誒佢哋嗰個目的地約摸嘅嗰個收費幾多，都會畀每一個嘅旅客。希望減少咗響我哋機場咧就坐到一啲誒即係黑的嘅個機會。呢啲噉嘅服務咧，我哋將來會進一步咧就陸續推出。我哋希望咧就係都會令到係海外嘅旅客嚟。

164
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:59,700
主席就今日嘅介紹嘅資料裏邊咧，有提到咧，就為咗減少食水用量咧，就使用海水冷卻嗱。咁其實呢個咧，即係除咗話誒可以減少食水水用量咧，係誒嗰個水資源方面咧係做得好啲之外咧，其實咧。

165
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:19,710
咧就我我睇呢個都差唔多等於誒而家啟德嗰個區域供冷系統咁啦，因為喺嗰個誒投影片嘅第九章裏邊咧，就嗰個圖一咧都好清楚㗎啦，噉就有一個冷卻廠啊，利用海水，咁海水咧亦都誒製咗。

166
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:39,720
呢個冷水之後咧，就呢啲海水咧就就翻翻落去海度，咁然後冷凍水咧就分發去到誒需要用嘅地方。咁呢，其實即係我都確認下，應該係一個區域供冷噉樣嘅系統啦，已經噉。所以我就想問咧，就即係話而家嘅誒，目前嘅誒。

167
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:59,730
機場嘅設施咧，即係是否都已經係用緊類似噉樣嘅系統？噉啊，將來咧第三條跑道咧，當然呢個系統都會相當大啦。咁會唔會咧亦都同而家嘅系統咧，即係整合咧成為一個誒大型嘅啲區域供冷嘅系統啊，或者咧有一定程度上咧能夠即係互相誒。

168
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:19,740
誒支援，噉係誒使到咧能夠達到更加好嘅誒嗰個效率，同埋咧都真係達到即係減排嘅效果。咁第二點咧，主席，因為今日嘅資料上面咧就即係誒，我當然嗰個今日嘅介紹咧，主要係本身嗰個客。

169
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:39,750
客運廊啦，咁但係，既然都提到話相關嘅客運大樓設施咧，我就想問一問咧，就係誒，如果將來擴建之後咧，整個咁大嘅機場中間嗰個所謂連接性嘅問題啊，咁即係話即係由一個誒客運廊去到另一個客運廊嚇，咁將來嗰

170
00:42:52,590 --> 00:43:12,600
Thank you. I can clarify on the existing facilities. We have a very extensive seawater cooling system put in with T1, which also was extended when we built the original T2 and other buildings. So there's quite a large system already where we pump water, seawater around for cooling purposes. That system is part of the third runway.

171
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:32,610
Concourse will be expanded. We will also build a bigger system, a different system for the third runway concourse. Again, using seawater where we can to cool that system. And you're right that if we can provide connections to, we can provide backups to each. The T1 and T2 systems are interlinked, and we can use chillers from either building in the event that.

172
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:52,620
as an element of contingency. So we are looking very much looking at connecting those systems and making sure that we again expand the system that was has been so successful for the last almost 20 years at the existing island. In terms of connectivity, the third runway concourse is as you say quite distant. It will be between the the

173
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:12,630
current northern runway and the new runway, that's the concourse where we get on and off, of course, the aircraft. It will be linked by a very efficient APM system back to Terminal Two, and the connectivity between the two terminal systems, Terminal One and the Terminal Two connected to TRC, will occur there. And so the system is has we've modelled

174
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:32,640
The system very carefully to make sure that we can still achieve what we call the minimum connect time, which is the time for a transfer passenger in the event he was it from one terminal had to go all the way to the midfield, and we can still achieve the 50 minute publish minimum connect time that we that we currently enjoy at the airport. So we've been looking very carefully at making sure efficient transfer of passengers.

175
00:44:43,850 --> 00:45:03,860
即係主多謝主席，我特別關心咧嗰個即係行誒行李嗰個自動系統。咁兩個方面咧，一個咧就係即係過去幾年咧，即係畀人感覺甚至數字都睇到咧，嗰個你嗰個自動系統所送達出嚟嘅時間咧，冇以前咧好似咁快捷，可能都達到第一。

176
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:23,870
件嗰個三廿分鐘內嗰個要求，但係往後嗰啲咧就畀好多人感覺到咧就等得好耐，噉啊噉啊有啲都係歸咎於咧就係員工咧就唔夠，咁員工唔夠咧亦都有個歸咎就係根本咧就係嗰個勞動強度就比較緊要咧，需要有好多工傷啊或者勞損。

177
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:50,150
誒而家好兩難嘅，噉你話減輕到工人嗰個勞動強度，當然歡迎啦。但係到翻轉會唔會替代咗工人咧？我想聽清楚呢一度。第二，如果真係幫到工人或者幫到上效率，點解唔而家已經喺而家嘅機場度度安置咧？我想聽一聽呢方面嘅情況，唔該。好啊，誒，總裁，係頭先。

178
00:45:50,150 --> 00:46:10,160
咧就我同事都有響誒嗰個短片嚟有介紹咗嗰個系統，大家可以睇到咧。其實就我哋依家由今年開始準備，係已經係響現有嘅兩排系統誒，即係引入嘅一個行李誒處理系統咧，誒係唔可能誒完全替代誒工人嘅。

179
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:30,170
因為個必須要由人去去推動。不過咧，過往嚟講咧，就老實講，誒行李重嘅時候咧，就誒你唔好話係女士啊，可能一個男人都未必可抬得起件行李。咁所以喺呢方面確實就好容易有工傷問題，甚至亦都因為噉嘅話咧，有請人係有時即係因為依家香港即係。

180
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:50,180
失業率咁低嘅話咧，就可能未必請足人嘅話，有一段時間確實咧就係誒達標嘅情況比較唔理想。咁但係過過去嗰一年咧，呢個情況係已經有有啲改善。噉我哋希望依一個系統誒能引入之後咧，就係令到咧就一方面咧就係係可以咧就不但止話唔需要下下咧一件行李要兩個人抬。

181
00:46:50,180 --> 00:47:10,190
甚至咧就我哋請一啲女士都可以咧係誒操作到呢個系統。咁依家大家知道，實際上因為誒失業率低嘅話咧，香港要請咁多嘅男士去機機場工作都可能有困難。咁一個，我覺得係一個比較大嘅人力資源，我哋依家仲未完全係開發嘅，就係誒誒一啲。

182
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:30,200
女士啦，咁依方面嚟講，我哋唔係淨係靠依個系統嘅，有好多其他嘅配套咧。我哋希望將來更加多嘅女士覺得都可以喺我哋機場係揾到就業機會。咁嗱，依個系統咧仍然需要人。我哋有其實有測試過好多唔同嘅一啲所謂自動化嘅系統，有啲完全唔需要用人嘅啲系統，我哋發覺其實個效果唔係太理想。

183
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:50,220
誒，依一個咧係可以減少用人，但係仍然係需要靠人嚟操作。誒，咁誒，我哋已經咧實際上咧就響誒就機場咧就已經測試咗半年，亦都同工會咧就好多工人嘅同事咧一齊試過，大家覺得個系統都係可行嘅。噉我哋準備咧由今年開始逐步咧。

184
00:47:50,220 --> 00:48:10,230
就喺機場所有嘅行李區入邊咧，會引入呢一個系統。咁將來如果效果好嘅話咧，將來嚟講咧，三三跑系統落實，其實當然會進一步係係咁做啦。即係你嘅意思就係其實已經係有計劃咧，具體計劃係即係替代而家個系統嘅啦。我聽落。唔係，依家唔係替代。其實個系統本身咧，整個行李系統本身。

185
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,700
唔使。

186
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,210
個北商業大樓嘅造價幾多錢啊？

187
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,730
噉啊！你唔設計多啲嘅停機位？

188
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,420
依個只係我諗係嗰個。

189
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,340
啲飛機要停出去啊！誒，仲裁。

190
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,880
因為你夠位，你可以伸出去夠位，做多啲停機位㗎。

191
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,280
係嘛，總裁？點解仲要有百分之五嘅percent要坐巴士咧？

192
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:49,380
係應該係全部用曬呢一個嘅停機停機位，即係點解要即係要用巴士咧？即係如果你設計，既然可以再設計多啲嘅，噉你明顯係畀人一個感覺，你係造數啊嘛！

193
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:30,240
咧就當然唔可能替代，係喺其實可以係輔助嘅系統嚟嘅。就依家咧就搬搬行李咧，老實講，然係我哋現有個系統係靠人。噉你你行李誒去到嗰個誒行李誒倉庫嗰度咧，就要靠人抬上個車製度。咁依家有依個系統咧，就可以加入去。所以點解我哋研究咗都食可以話係誒差唔多即係一年啦，就要。

194
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:50,250
揾一個系統，本身都係唔需要係完全替代曬原有系統，可以加落去原有嘅節省咗幾多幾多所謂人力啊？嗱，我哋就冇真係去預計咧，因為點解咧？仍然係需要用人啦。我哋就冇預計咧點樣可以話真係減少幾多人，但係我哋相信咧，就響嗰個效益同埋咧就減少工人。

195
00:48:50,250 --> 00:49:10,260
嘅嗰個勞損方面會有好大幫助。陳偉業，要嗱嗱主席就誒涉及到成個嘅誒新發展咧，呢個嘅客運大樓同埋有關嘅設施，我諗有幾個主要嘅問題咧。即係一個就係究竟家下現時呢個大樓興建嗰個整體嘅。

196
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:30,270
誒情況係咪恰當咧？因為睇落去咧，似乎呢個係半個大樓嚟嘅啫，即係就唔係即係全國嘅大樓嘅。咁究竟即係係咪因為要將嗰個啊報出嚟嗰個數要削減做數咧，就做細啲咧？咁所以你原本諗住計劃興建即係整個大。

197
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:50,280
大樓變咗好少咧，因為上一次我都提到咧，如果你計每一個泊位嚟講咧，個數字係驚人嘅，係嘛？即係你用翻嗰個泊位嘅數字，除翻嗰個總開支啊，一千即係五百億啊，其實大家都估住係去到二千億㗎啦。咁咁究竟呢個係咪一個合乎成本效益？

198
00:49:50,280 --> 00:50:10,290
即係嘅誒做法，可唔可以答咗呢個問題先啊？主席誒，總裁誒，我我哋誒就喺度可以講話咧，就誒依一個所謂我諗啊，陳議員提嘅就係係咪單歪同埋雙歪依個問題咧？噉就誒，我哋誒響過去嗰一兩年做咗依方面嘅設計之後咧，誒我哋得到嘅。

199
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:30,300
嘅嗰個結論咧，就係話誒，依家單位第一單位其實同當初誒我哋展示嗰個咧係有啲唔同嘅。咁呢個單位本身咧已經係足夠係處理誒我哋預計個三千萬額外嘅嗰個旅客。咁喺噉嘅情況之下咧，我哋覺得當然冇需要嘥土地，就特登將嗰個誒誒建築物嘅嗰。

200
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:50,310
個誒可以話覆蓋面加大啦。家下單位幾多個泊位啊？總共誒五十七個，五十七個。咁原本雙位幾多個泊位嘅？當年雙位五十八個，就相差爭一個。咁但係老實講，我哋一預留咗地方嘅話，將嚟有需要嘅話咧，我哋仍然可以將誒剩餘嘅嗰個土地誒開發。咁咧，我哋估計咧未。

201
00:50:50,310 --> 00:51:10,320
來再開發嘅話咧，嗰個剩翻地土地可以再額儲多儲多兩千萬嘅。你預計嗱，即係我唔知家下平均有幾多成嘅航機係用誒巴士接載啦。咁如果你而家用你呢一個，我畀你落成之後有五十七個泊位，你估計落成之後幾耐又會用翻巴士接載？

202
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:37,500
嗱，我哋嗰個嗱，當然呢個同誒同話係咪滿咗就用誒巴士就誒冇必然關係咧。我哋嘅設計嘅概念咧就係有百分之九十五個percent咧係要用誒橋廊廊橋，只五個percent咧就係用誒即係所謂誒巴士出去。唔係點點解你點解你唔設計曬？

203
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,970
主席，誒就。

204
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,910
就成立咗一個誒創新科技基金，好少錢啫。

205
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:29,120
有有冇成效咧？或者你哋而家見到其實啱唔啱使咧啲嘢，或者會唔會初步有啲例子可以講到出嚟咧？

206
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:17,940
不商業大樓，你都要講點解要要做㗎嘛？同埋好奇怪點解會同三跑無關啊嘛？農場。

207
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:18,720
噉我哋覺得效果都係誒誒，雖然我哋淨係開始咗誒半年啦，但係我睇到個成效係唔錯。你你個基金畀佢哋用咧，噉佢你你即係算係一個。

208
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:23,100
路上嘅嗰啲燈啊等等有冇損壞？咁依個喺個速度上面咧，就增加咗好多。咁所以依方面嚟講咧，確實咧係有好多香港好嘅科技公司咧，佢哋嗰啲科技係可應用喺我哋機場上邊。噉我哋都咧喺舊年咧。

209
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:25,710
個服務嗱，當然咧，依個可以話係響設計方面咧，就我亦會留翻少少嘅彈性。有時確實咧，就有啲情況之下咧，就誒你可能有需要係用誒即係遠程誒要用巴士啦。噉，加上依個都係一個服務水平嘅問題，同埋呢個明顯係做數啦，主席，我即係篤穿咗佢啦。第二就係關於嗰。

210
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:48,810
北商業大樓，誒，總裁。哦，我我哋誒北商業大樓其實點解我哋仲未有定案，所以又冇。即係另係一筆錢啦，即係你千五億其實就未夠嘅，一來就將嗰個嘅停機位，即係做壓細啦，整個嘅設計縮咗好多啦，第二就係將嗰個其他有啲可能數以十億計嘅。

211
00:52:48,810 --> 00:53:08,820
開支咧未包括在？唔係喎，我我想呢度澄清就北商業樓同三跑係冇必然關係，嗰個只不過係誒我哋機場現有嘅其中一個發展嘅項目。咁但係因為三跑而要再改建或者重建或者加建㗎嘛，即係好明顯係整體機場發展未來一個做法。你可唔可以畀個數字我？如果如果今日畀唔到，可唔？

212
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:28,830
唔係，我哋依家未有個數字，因為嗰塊地本身係同三跑冇關係。噉我哋係未未有，因為我哋仲未開始發展啊。噉我哋依家正係喺度研究緊將來北商業區嘅發展嘅嗰個方案，但係嗰個同三跑本身係冇必然關係。噉你都係基於三跑嗰個整體增加嗰個留日留客量，你只要再做不。

213
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:48,840
北商業大樓啫嘛，係嘛？完全無關，完全無關，即係可以取消嘅噉樣係。唔係嗰個咁鬼地嘅利用啦，我即係可以，真係可以唔要呢個北商業大樓嘅。唔係嗰個項目只係一個另外機場發展嘅另外項目啫。咁當然我哋希望有土地嘅話咧，儘量利用土地為香港增加多啲嘅嗰個零售嘅地點啫。主席，我唔知有冇其他文件介。

214
00:53:48,840 --> 00:54:08,850
少北商業大樓嗰個發展嘅背景咧，我想希望可以，即係會提供畀我哋個方案，即係點解要做呢樣嘢？點解可以同三跑無關？可唔可以畀份文件我哋解釋啊？或者我當我哋嗰個發展嘅方案係誒完成咗之後咧，我哋樂意提供。喂，你完成但係你初步個構思，點解要你都要講㗎嘛？點解有需要噉啊？

215
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:41,620
主席，我就見到你哋今次咧，即係特別講話要用好多創新啊、科技啊噉樣樣。我知道機管局咧，其實之前咧都有同一啲嘅機構合作啦，包括好似科學院啊等等。噉就誒，希望就若果要引入一啲科技嘅話，就唔係淨係去誒。

216
00:54:41,620 --> 00:55:01,630
唔知啦，揾翻啲最大嘅外國公司啊，噉樣嚟去提供。咁可能亦都有一啲好嘅意念，可能喺啲香港本地嘅公司嗰度揾到，或者咧調翻轉，可能你哋有啲理念需要係開發某一啲嘅方面嘅一啲技術，咁亦都可以利用翻一啲本地嘅專才嚇，咁亦都可以幫到呢啲本地公司咧。

217
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:21,770
可能如果佢哋嘅產品或者啲服務或者啲研發係適合嘅話咧，噉佢都可以攞到基金局作為一個好嘅一個reference啦。噉樣樣咁誒呢方面，我都知道你哋之前就即係有接觸過呢啲團體或者機構啦，咁同埋呢啲噉嘅公司啦。可唔可以講講其實有嗰個成效？

218
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:49,590
好誒，非常誒高興，喺度都講下我哋呢方面嘅嗰個誒諗法。咁確實，舊年咧，我哋開始咧就誒成立咗一個誒誒科技諮詢委員會，就係希望咧能夠一方面咧就係誒誒等好多響科技界嘅嘅一啲朋友咧都可以畀多啲意見我哋。

219
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,580
我想問問咧就。

220
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,510
啊，係會係點樣樣？

221
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,940
租值嘅情況會係點咧？

222
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,720
噉我想仲有一個咧，就係。

223
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,010
新大樓、新客運大樓嗰度咧。

224
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:32,470
仲有嗰個編配嘅方式。

225
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,620
將來嗰度個面積會有幾大呢？

226
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,810
我今年春節嘅時候咧。

227
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,450
嗰個零售業務同埋嗰啲飲餐飲啊！

228
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:51,030
啊，噉啊唔係話淨係世界知名品牌入到去都係。

229
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:14,150
去到而家客運大樓嗰度咧，排隊九個字啊，都食唔到嘢。

230
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:59,570
問拍來貨啊，來佬嘢，我希望能夠適當傾斜一啲咧，係支持香港嘅品牌。

231
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:45,290
咁嗱，仲有冇一個政策咧，係比較傾斜支持香港嘅品牌喺嗰度開設？

232
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:10,040
我諗誒，機場擴建同埋三跑對香港經濟嘅需要咧，係毋庸置疑嘅。嗯，進修界係全力支持呢個項目。

233
00:55:49,590 --> 00:56:09,600
將話我哋機場嘅發展入邊點樣可以咧就做到係喺世界喺呢方面嚟講咧都有一定嘅領先嘅地位。同時間咧，亦都希望呢個平台咧能夠幫我哋咧就係引進一啲本地喺呢方面嘅一啲新嘅一啲科技啦。咁誒確實咧就喺舊年嘅嗰幾句入邊咧，我哋同誒科技園啦，同。

234
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:29,610
好多其他嘅一啲誒科研，香港嘅一啲科研機構嘅合作咧，誒個成就即係成果係唔錯嘅。包括在響誒科技園咧，我哋都係誒有三間誒公司，即係經過其實有二十幾間啦。噉我哋篩選咗之後，有三間公司嘅一啲產品咧，同埋一啲誒理念咧，我覺得係可以影響響。

235
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:49,620
誒，我哋機場度咁包括咗誒，其中一間咧就係佢哋點樣用誒呢啲誒視像分析嘅嗰個系統嚟幫我哋咧，就係處理一啲誒日常機場邊嘅一啲問題，就好似包括咗其中一個我哋一準備會引用嘅，就係好似我哋每晚跑道嘅嗰個維修。咁以前每晚跑道維修，我哋必須要。

236
00:56:49,620 --> 00:57:09,630
用肉眼咧去測試咧，就究竟誒嗰個跑道上面嗰啲燈啊，嗰啲問題咧就有冇損壞？咁呢個需要時間好長。咁依一個誒企業咧，依個香港依班著科技嘅公司咧，引入咗一個技術之後咧，佢就靠誒視像嘅分析咧，就可以咧就誒知道咧究竟誒嗰個誒跑道。

237
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:47,360
係兩千萬。咁主要嘅作用係乜嘢咧？因為我哋睇到好多小嘅一啲企業本身咧，雖然有好嘅一啲誒誒意念啦，佢但係佢哋要做誒prototype咧，本身係誒可能冇噉嘅能力。噉我哋當覺得嗰個誒產品本身，我哋覺得係應用到嘅話咧，噉我哋喺呢個基金度咧攞少少錢出嚟。

238
00:57:47,360 --> 00:58:07,370
等佢哋可以咧，先做個prototype，做一個測試。噉我哋覺得嗰個測試係成功嘅話咧，變咗依一個產品咧就可以進一步咧就引進嗰個機場。咁一個誒本身我哋覺得希望能鼓勵更加多小嘅企業都可以覺得我哋機場將來會係佢哋誒科技發展嘅一個好嘅一個平台。

239
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:39,060
即係你唔會有譬如知識產權啊，或者各方面嘅嘢嘅限制嘅。即係你第日會唔會話即係當因為你出錢㗎嘛？你會唔會當？我哋主要咧嗱，講嗰個個問題就唔係我哋買咗佢嗰個誒知識產權，我哋只係畀佢少少錢畀佢咧，就先做個prototype出嚟。因所因為有問題就係有時我哋當然啲都要測試響安全啊，係響運用方面。

240
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:59,070
嚟講係咪實際上真係確實可行咧？咁咁淨係一個意念有時冇辦法誒，就能夠即係知道究竟誒用起上嚟係得唔得？噉我哋只係畀啲錢咧，當我哋接受話嗰個概念本身係行得通嘅話咧，我哋只係畀少少錢去做個prototype嚟試用啫。咁所以我同佢哋本身嗰個知識產權係冇關係。黃定光議員，嗯，多謝主席。

241
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,610
淨係咪飛啊？

242
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:24,260
仲有買一飛之後咧。

243
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,610
噉我仲想問問，而家新嘅？

244
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,450
啊！咁呢呢樣嘢，誒機管局。

245
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,940
我發覺個價格比市區係貴好多。

246
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,800
咁將來嗰度會唔會出現啲噉嘅情況咧？

247
01:00:51,140 --> 01:01:01,290
將來嘅新嘅客運大樓，嗰個個人服務化咧係相當先進嘅。咁新舊大樓會唔會同步係咁先進咧？

248
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:46,930
個有關管理方面有冇啲乜嘢規定，能夠對嗰嗰個消費者咧係冇冇嗰把刀冇咁利嘅啊？即係剁得咁深咧？

249
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:35,480
開始陸陸續續咧，響誒現有嘅機場度咧就引進。噉我哋希望誒呢啲技術進一步成熟同埋進一步係誒提升之後咧，好多好嘅理理念咧，可以將嚟擺響三跑整個系統入邊。

250
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:21,740
概念問題。好啊，誒，總裁，誒，我哋將來新嘅嗰個誒三跑嗰個客運樓咧，就有望會有二十八萬平方米嘅地方，咁有幾多會係用嚟做零售同埋餐飲咧？就我哋一仲做緊最後嘅設計，所以未有一個定案。噉我哋希望有冇概念咧？誒，噉我哋依家仲喺度。

251
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:41,750
做緊，所以未有一個最終嘅概念，因為依個都需要係幾年後先起好啦。噉我哋依家希望將來當然響呢方面引入一啲新嘅一啲一啲概念啦。但係響依方面，我亦都希望能夠達到一定嘅平衡。就一方面嚟講，誒有一啲旅客會響希望喺機場見到一啲誒最好嘅國際品牌，但係亦都有好多嘅旅客誒，好似係黃議員咁講，在

252
01:01:41,750 --> 01:02:01,760
希望會見到一啲好嘅本地嘅一啲品牌。咁如果大家有留意嘅話咧，過去一年嚟講咧，我哋喺機場現有嘅嗰兩跑系統入邊咧，我哋新嘅我哋嘅T One入邊咧，都隱隱進咗好多香港本地嘅一啲品牌。噉我哋有個特別一個區，專門就係畀香港嘅一啲品牌誒，可以喺嗰度咧就係。

253
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:21,770
誒，即係誒做生意嘅噉，所以一個概念，我哋希望將來亦都能夠引申到去新嘅嗰個誒誒三跑系統嘅嗰啲誒客運廊入邊。咁至於話誒，我睇聽到話黃燕華要誒，我哋要等九個字噉，向度好抱歉。咁確實咧，有時響春節好忙嘅時候咧，就誒我哋嘅設施而家。

254
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:41,780
確實係感覺到有好大嘅壓力，咁所以其中一樣我哋一做緊嘅咧，就嚟緊嗰幾年咧，就就除咗三跑系統之外咧，我哋必須要進一步擴大現有誒即係T One等等嘅設施，因為確實咧就依家人越嚟越多，係喺呢方面咧就誒可以話有少少不敷應用誒，但咧噉樣就即係。

255
01:02:41,780 --> 01:03:01,790
誒設施增加就唔表示嘅價格要相應增加。咁頭先黃議員話佢感覺到咧，就響我哋度嘅飲餐飲嘅價錢係比市區高嘅話咧，依個情況咧就即係好值得我哋關注。咁因因為依個情況唔應該發生，因為我哋係有規定咧，如果係同一個誒餐廳同一個產品咧。

256
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:21,800
我哋同市區嘅價錢必須一致嘅。咁如果張愛華議員見到一個情況咧，誒，我我歡迎佢向我哋投訴，我哋一定會跟進。譚志明議員，新舊大樓會唔會同步？會同步。噉我哋希望咧，喺呢方面，一方面嚟講咧，就依家我哋開始。點解頭先我哋講好多依啲新嘅一啲科技嘅一啲概念咧？我哋已經。

257
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,520
好，我接下嚟。

258
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,770
我我見過一啲生物處理嘅係非常好嘅，變成水分同空氣嘅啫喎。

259
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:47,050
嘅喺將軍澳間廠度咧，轉化成為一啲誒餘量，噉啊兩方面我都有做緊嚇。

260
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:03,420
咁頭先啊，黃議員咧啊，都提到咧，就係我都最近喺機場咧，就係。

261
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:57,710
揾同A A聯絡下啦，即係我哋或者成個Apple Community根本就唔夠人嚇，我哋希望能夠請多啲人。

262
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:29,810
遊客又好，誒唔好有一個印象咧嚟到機場咧，覺得畀人劏啊呢個感覺啦嚇，唔該主席。

263
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:43,910
易志明議員，啊唔該主席，誒我首先申報啦，我係機管局嘅成員啦，就誒喺嗰個誒支誒。

264
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:42,130
多謝主席。誒，可能啲講咗都唔定嘅，因為其實我見到咧，即係誒新嘅客運大樓嗰個嘅係誒一啲所謂新嘅設備咧，其實。

265
01:03:44,190 --> 01:04:00,590
presentation嗰度咧個powerpoint第十一版嗰度咧提到就關於嗰個on-site processing of organic waste嗱，噉我啊想問一問咧，而家你哋嗰個設施咧係咪已經足以應付成個機場所有嗰啲F＆B outlet嗰啲嘅所謂organic waste啊？

266
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:21,700
誒，馮生誒，簡單我哋處理誒有機嘅廢物咧，有兩個渠道。一個渠道就係我哋本身係有一個廚餘機轉化成為一啲誒，我哋叫即係一啲土壤嘅補給劑，喺我哋成個機場島上面嘅所有綠化地方使用。咁呢，我哋自己嘅兩部機咧已經足夠啦。咁但係我另外咧仲有一個。

267
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:41,710
誒，我哋嘅承辦商咧，就會將我哋機場所有我哋機場自己機場嘅管理局啦，及所有我哋嘅F＆B連同埋機場島上其他嘅公司嚇所產生嘅廚餘，即係包括可能係其他嘅非餐公司啊，佢產廚餘，我全部都由佢去去維誒去去去收集，跟住就拎去佢哋。

268
01:04:47,370 --> 01:05:07,380
O.K.誒，主要都係愛嚟誒製造一啲魚糧啊，或者係啲誒肥料啊，噉就冇用一啲生物分解嘅方法誒誒，暫時未有。不過遲啲政府可能會喺燒荷灣有新嘅設施嘅時候，我都會同政府傾傾嚇點樣去利用佢個新嘅設施嚇。好，你哋嗰度其實有空位自己可以處理嘅，因為我。

269
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:32,060
啊，即係慳咗好多功夫嘅。跟住頭先咧，就誒阿鄧家彪議員咧就提到關於即係佢嘅憂慮啦。你哋引入一啲誒自動化嘅工作咧，就會可能咧減少咗啲工作崗位啦。咁呢個同我嘅理念啊，剛剛相反啊。噉我作為機管局成員咧，更加咧希望你哋做多啲自動化。

270
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:52,070
而取代人手嗰個嘅嘅工作啊，咁當然咧就係誒要係一個誒有誒誒減省到個成本為原則啦嚇。咁其實啊，鄧議員行開咗啦，我覺得佢唔需要擔心嘅。我哋機場大家知道啦，爭緊五六千人啊，多多都要。如果工工聯會有啲咩朋友想揾工做嘅咧，就

271
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:23,710
誒等誒等機嘅時間咧，食嗰啲嘢，哇！埋單嚇我一條嚇，嗰個嗰個費用真係比我想象中高咗好多。咁或者啊啊，總裁你去，我事後再同你講翻邊間啦，呢度唔方便講啊。請你去研究下，即係你，即係我都同意咧。誒，我希望誒香港嘅市民有。

272
01:06:42,650 --> 01:07:02,660
其實今年係二零一六年啦，噉我見好多嗰啲諗法咧，都係今日嘅概念嚟嘅。可能今日你啲用緊都唔頂㗎啦。咁可能我想問就係話，其實你即係點樣可以project或者評估咧？就係去到二零二三年真係開檔嘅時候咧，其實嗰個嘅係科技應用嗰個實際情況係點樣？咁呢個好general咁咧，你睇。

273
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,740
係作為補充。

274
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,350
將啲乘客由。

275
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,000
誒，第一輪仲有冇同事想問？

276
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,450
喺會議交代啦，有個文件正式講一講，就係呢廿八億。

277
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:55,600
即係嗰個舊嘅設計大樓個使用嘅情況，嚟到今日要拆卸，究竟即係嗰個決定嘅過程同埋嗰個嘅係即係。

278
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:22,670
或者調翻轉就係話，你係咪即係今日喺文件所講所有嘅係諗住更高效嘅係方式咧，都會喺今天咧就已經展開個啟用個進度同時間表係點樣樣，就令到我哋都掌握到就係即係呢呢一啲考慮咧，其實係誒仲會係與時並進嘅呢第一點。但係我想問嘅係另外兩個問題。

279
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:42,680
第一個咧就係即係要客運大樓咧，其實係過往舊嘅一個客運大樓嚟嘅。咁用咗即係好短嘅時間咧，就要成個拆卸咗。噉我想問下就係話，即係你機管局即係抌咗廿幾億去做個舊客運大樓，然後拆卸再重建嘅話咧，其實誒當中你可唔可以有個文件？我唔使。

280
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:16,250
你哋機管局有冇係進行過任何嘅一個係研究或者評估，當日做呢個決定嘅時間咧，嗰個問責嘅情況，我想了解呢一點啫。嚇，第二個我想問下就係話，因為誒過而家呢個二號客運大樓似乎咧，佢同呢個一號大樓之間嘅連接咧係完全倚靠嗰個嘅係智運系統嘅，即係嗰個係。

281
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:36,270
即係誒，總之係自動化個接運系統啦，噉樣樣。咁其實有冇可能咧？其實佢都係喺個即係安排上邊咧，係做到佢直頭可以好似即係你一般嘅巴士咧，我哋A車咧都可以係去到呢個接運大樓，好似係直頭係咗上落安排噉樣樣嘅，就唔使就下下都要靠個接運，即係接運系統咧係。

282
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:57,640
客運大樓佢係一送到第二個站噉樣樣轉嚟轉去嚇，請你講講個安排，代主席。誒誒，我想或者喺度先答呢幾個問題啦。咁誒，與時並進嘅問題，噉我哋確實咧好誒關注將來即係新誒落成咗二零二三二四落成嘅時候咧，嗰個新嘅嗰。

283
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:17,650
個誒機場會係誒最先進嘅一個一個機場，一個智慧型機場。當然又冇辦法可以知道，其實就係十年後嘅最新嘅科技會點樣。依家科技係兩三年都會有個新嘅改變。誒，但係頭先我哋講嘅咧就唔係淨係純粹就係講話究竟做啲咩具體嘅嘢。我哋講方向方面要係朝咩？

284
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:37,660
方向嚟行啦。噉我哋睇到嘅話咧，就自動化、誒自助啊、誒我哋講緊個人化呢啲噉嘅發展嘅方向，我哋估咧就十年後咧仍然會係朝依個方向發展。噉我哋依家係開始將好多呢啲理念應用喺現有嘅機場度，因為實際上我哋依家機場都好擠迫，需要呢啲新嘅一啲誒。

285
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:57,670
設施咧，亦都誒好多旅客，亦都係好歡迎啲新嘅設施。噉我哋希望喺呢個過程入邊咧，令到我哋咧就更加會瞭解未來設計新嘅嗰個三跑系統入邊需要引進邊一方面嘅技術入去。噉我哋亦都希望到時會有一定嘅彈性，令到我哋有需要嘅時候咧，到時嚟講係可以作到一定嘅嘅修改。咁至於話，

286
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:17,680
話嗰個T two嘅話咧，咁誒，我哋唔係將整個T two拆卸，我哋會將佢改建，我哋保留百分之六十以上。其其實咧，就因為依家嘅T two咧就唔係一個所謂full service嘅terminal。將來咧，為咗三跑嘅個需要咧，就要將佢改變成一個full service一個terminal。咁所以咁依方面嚟講。

287
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:37,690
仲有部分嘅設施係需要有所誒嘅更改嘅，可唔可提供相關嘅資料啊？即係由舊嘅T Two改到新嘅T Two所需要嘅經費啊，同埋個改變嘅內容。好誒，噉就另外嚟講咧，就有關嗰個接運系統噉，因為新嘅嗰個誒三跑嘅客運廊咧，離開現有嘅嗰個地方咧，誒距離都係。

288
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:57,700
係比較遠噉，所以咧，我哋相信咧，就坐巴士未必一個好誒恰當嘅做法。噉我哋係會好依靠將來呢個接運系統，亦都因為噉嘅關係嚟講咧，我哋必須要係提供百分之百嘅readiness，即係保保證到將來就算係萬一有一條嘅嗰個誒接運系統有問題嘅話咧，都有其他。

289
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,380
副主席。

290
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:06,410
陳偉儀表。

291
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,400
別外，Mr.蒲。

292
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,720
Mr. Pooh。

293
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,710
如果冇就第二輪嘅，啊。

294
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:54,630
啲本地嘅設計師，尤其是係年青嘅設計師咧，係可以參與依一個大樓嘅設計計劃。

295
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:29,970
process the scheme design for the third runway concourse. In fact, was done by a local architect working with a team of engineers and cross cross engineer specialists. So yes.

296
01:13:50,760 --> 01:14:04,590
Hong Kong without local architects contributing because of the various buildings department and authority processes statutory process they have to go through. So I do envisage there will be a healthy use of local architects. I welcome that.

297
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:27,670
係多謝主席。誒，主席頭先誒，我想再追問就係關於誒文件第二段咧，有講到就係話誒，而家嗰個設計咧就係一個初步設計嚟嘅，咁遲啲咧就會有一個更加即係誒完整嘅一個final design啦。噉我就想問就係誒，其實而家你。

298
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:47,680
你喺設計依一個大樓嘅時候咧，誒有冇去用多啲就係香港本地一啲設計師或者設計師行咧，係等佢哋有份可以參與依一個嘅誒誒計劃嘅？咁如果而家冇，第時喺誒即係做final detail plan嘅時候咧，會唔會有機會可以畀多？

299
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:17,380
Thank you. A very good question. For the third runway concourse, we haven't yet started the detailed design. We we intend to be tendering that later this year. And as with all our designs, we have a completely open competition for the design. So we we encourage all local practitioners to to contribute to that design.

300
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:50,610
Yeah, I'm just wondering whether the open competition would be specifically targeting any sort of local architect firms to allow them to have the opportunity. Because in the past, these major infrastructure projects often offer opportunities for international architectural firms, which is understandable. But in

301
01:12:50,610 --> 01:13:10,620
Want to promote more local architect firms and to give them a chance to participate in these major Hong Kong infrastructure projects. Can there be parts of the project where there could be open competition targeted specifically for local architect firms, so as to give them more work and business opportunities?

302
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:30,740
Mr. Paul, again, very a very good question. The the you're right, large projects as this do tend to attract international architects. But I'm delighted to say it's also attracting local architects. I have many discussions, obviously before tender with with many local architects, and they are expressing an interest not just in the third runway concourse, but also with.

303
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:50,750
within the other facilities that we will be building, which will give other opportunities. And so, yes, I can say it will be an open design process. And on the detail design of T two, we actually have a local architect working on it. And of course, you'll be very familiar that even international architects coming here, it's very difficult for them to to simulate within.

304
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:26,820
主持人，我係想問翻嗰個嘅海水製冷對嗰個嘅環境嘅影響。第一，我唔誒上呢一個嘅環知會嘅時候，呢個海水製冷嘅有關嘅影響係咪整個機場三跑上環知會嘅一部分，定係海水製冷係冇包括在內嘅？可唔可以澄清下呢一點？誒。

305
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,180
心態嘅問題啊！

306
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,170
啊，姚思榮議。

307
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:28,440
Chairman, if I, oh, Mr. Poul, sorry, Chairman, if I may just quickly give a quick answer, I can confirm that the the cooling water discharges were also the impacts of those were considered in the EIA report.

308
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:44,270
同埋啲地電咧，係全部係replace咗，亦都係mandy咗所有航空公司嘅飛機嚟到香港機場咧，係一定要使用呢啲系統。所以喺呢方面嘅設計咧，係全部配合曬所有航啊唔同種類嘅飛機嘅，係冇問題嘅。

309
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:27,400
係改善幾多咧？第一個問題，第二個問題就係有關第第十六段誒，第十五段嘅誒，將來新嘅呢個誒三跑誒系統開開之後咧，停機位咧將會裝置一啲嘅供電同埋誒預調空調系統嘅。

310
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:53,030
sorry the the just getting the translation now the seawater cooling system will be part of the we have an existing seawater cooling system we'll be enlarging that to incorporate to deal with the the larger facilities we'll have on the existing but you include this in your submission to the environmental advisory committee yes yeah yeah sorry so so that was part of the the

311
01:14:53,030 --> 01:15:13,040
Environmental impact assessment，都係被included in in that assessment。In terms of the scheme designs that we included in that EIA， yes。嗱，主席，我我係好擔憂呢個海水製冷，即係誒導致到海水嗰個附近温度嗰個嘅提升咧，對海豚嘅影響嘅。噉我唔知道環知會點解會過咧，因為啟德嗰個啟德嗰個研究。

312
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:33,050
夠咧，啟得嗰個海水製冷咧，就誒令到嗰啲水出嚟咧係高兩至三度嘅。噉就大家都知道，即係水嘅温度對海豚嘅影響可能構成致命，甚至係即係誒影響個生態啦。咁所以即係你嗰個三跑已經係喺香港水域，即係海豚嗰。

313
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:53,060
個嘅生活最繁忙嘅地方啦，已經係啊，咁喺嗰個地方再排出啲海水，個温度係即係影響整體附近海豚生活嘅環境嘅話咧，即係我覺得呢個係好大問題嚟嘅。咁所以主席記錄在案，表示我個憂慮啦。噉我希望我睇下話。

314
01:15:53,060 --> 01:16:13,070
環保處稍後有冇誒，或者即係秘書處叫翻有關部門畀翻個誒，即係資料我哋。即係究竟呢一個嘅所謂嘅環境評估，關於呢個海水製冷嗰個評估嘅結果係點，同埋有啲乜嘢所謂嘅措施咧，係減少嗰個嘅海水温度嘅提升，而影響海豚或者係海洋。

315
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:48,910
耀思榮業，including temperature係。多謝主席。誒，第一個問題就問誒第二廿五段有關行李嗰個誒處理系統嗰度嘅。咁誒，大家知道而家嗰個行李嗰個處理咧誒，因為人手問題咧誒，最近我都接接到啲投訴係有有所延誤嘅，即係比以往嗰個。

316
01:16:48,910 --> 01:17:08,920
嘅時間係長咗嘅。噉我亦好高興睇到誒，即係機管局方面喺誒一六一七年咧，會採取一個工具輔助行李裝卸系統啦。噉樣，我想問下，如果用呢個系統之後咧，成個嗰個行李運送嘅時間同而家嘅情況咧，會改善會估計。

317
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:47,690
咁誒，其實呢個係好好㗎。咁但係我唔知啲飛機方面嘅設備咧，誒現有嘅情況同埋將來未來飛機嘅設備可唔可以配合到呢個有關系統嘅安裝？如果配合到，咁估計要百分之幾到配合到。如果配合唔到，咁呢啲設備開開出嚟會唔會有個浪費嘅問題咧？

318
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,930
呃。

319
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,500
即係嗰個嘅發電。

320
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:54,810
即係利用太陽能，即係發電嘅。

321
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:49,280
嘅供電量係係會透過太陽能。

322
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,330
個比較係提升咗幾多噉，同埋有幾多成？

323
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,540
同埋個個成分有冇機會提升咧？Mr. Poole。

324
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,660
有冇考慮過，同埋會唔會會唔會再重新考慮咧？有，Mr. Pooh。

325
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:43,260
提升嗰個即係誒天然即係人造呢個呢個太陽能嘅嗰個嘅發電嘅機會。

326
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:13,180
個video其實我哋都見到係需要員工去用呢個自動幣，純粹係減低咗呢一個對員工嘅physical嘅demand方面嘅啫。

327
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:31,270
但係，我想補充咧，依個對我哋請人係會有好大幫助。我哋希望依家咧就誒頭先都有議員講到咧，我哋確實咧依家誒機場咧就嗰個空缺係比較多。我哋希望依個設施有咗之後咧，對我哋補充誒誒勞動力會有一個比較大嘅幫助。

328
01:17:47,810 --> 01:18:07,820
好啊，變為嘅時間。好啊，喺行李呢個輸送方面咧，啊呢一個新嘅自動臂呢一個設施咧，係對呢一個成個嘅操作嘅時間咧，個影響唔係好大啊大嘅。啊，最重要佢係減少呢一個對呢個啊員工方面嘅工。

329
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:27,830
上嗰方面咧，同埋減少嘅勞力方面。噉啊，喺呢一個啊，頭先講另外一個問題就我哋叫A.P.U.同埋呢個Fixed Ground Power咧，其實我哋咧已經喺前年開始咧，將我哋機場所有嘅橋下底嘅叫做啊Pre-condition Air P.C.A.

330
01:18:44,930 --> 01:19:04,940
好啊！主席，想問翻行李嗰度咧，如果係用咗呢個新嘅一個誒機械繫統咧，咁誒人手方面會減輕幾多度啊？還是都係冇減輕到嘅人手？誒，主席誒，頭先啊，總裁都答過喺呢方面咧，我哋冇特別做一個統計，但係咧用呢一個自動臂都好咧。頭先我哋有個。

331
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:51,850
好啊！啊，陳偉業，唔要冇冇朱姐，我睇到就係即係有關嗰個嘅啊大樓嘅設計，好多係用呢個好特色嘅所謂外牆嘅誒設計嘅特色同埋啲物料啦。但係當初設計嗰陣時，點解唔考慮增增加多啲即係太陽能板？

332
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:21,350
We are looking at the use of photovoltaics. In fact, we have a very large array that we've just put in on the midfield, some twelve hundred square metres of photovoltaics. We're looking at the performance of those, and we'll use the feedback we get from that to allow us to also decide and design how we put photovoltaics.

333
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:41,360
on the roof of the new third runway concourse, which which we will do to to the extent that is practicable. 主席可唔可以畀啲資料，就係即係譬如你用翻現時機場嗰個嘅每每立方米嗰個計算啊，即係如果你講個用電量啊，新呢一個同舊嗰個，從現有嗰個。

334
01:20:55,220 --> 01:21:15,230
Mr. Poole, I can't give you the exact numbers in terms of we, as I said, the terminal one is a very very efficient building already. With midfield concourse where we've just opened and we've become very much more efficient on that, I believe on energy use we're something like twenty percent twenty percent overall better than the building energy code.

335
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:35,240
equivalent, and obviously we're seeking to to be even better on the third runway concourse. With respect to photovoltaics, unfortunately, even the 1200 array, the efficiency of them is still relatively low. So the actual amount of electricity generated from photovoltaics is is still relatively limited.咁但可唔可以可唔可以喺個設計？

336
01:21:49,430 --> 01:22:09,440
We certainly will, and in fact we we are already talking with CLP with some of the lessons they've learnt from their arrays, both in Hong Kong and elsewhere, to see whether there are more efficient panels. We for the midfield concourse only completed recently. We use the most efficient panels we could find in the market. That market is always developing, and in the years to come we will obviously.

337
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:58,390
啊！多主席，其實我覺得呢一個係即係誒。

338
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:37,420
誒，漸漸嗰個發電整體百分比可以大幅提升咧。誒，Mr.Paul，因為而家好多地方都做緊呢啲嘢㗎啦，其實。

339
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:08,180
咁至於話將嗰個誒二號誒客運廊本身嘅改建嘅情況咧，我哋稍後會為啊議員再提供一啲資料。

340
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:53,980
有新決定嗰陣時，畀到啲數字我哋，真係我覺得喺啲玻璃幕牆頂嗰啲地方可以加呢個太陽能板嘅。其實其實嗰個科技上設計上唔難做嘅，其實。胡志偉議。

341
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:10,390
一來令到呢個可能係全香全世界最新嘅，當然我反對三跑啦，主席。咁但係你喺嗰個新嘅大樓嗰方面嚟講，即係都會有啲個，咦？呢個係全世界最最～

342
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:22,730
呢個啊，即係講呢個太陽能發電，可能係百分比最高嘅，咁即係起碼有一啲畀人感覺到，即係畀人揾笨之餘，都有少少嘢啲渣拿攞翻啦，係嘛？

343
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:29,450
keep very close look at that to see whether we can have a larger array and a more efficient array。即係同埋有冇研究考慮喺嗰個嘅誒玻璃幕牆頂嗰啲地方，特別太陽方向強嘅地方，喺嗰啲地方增設啲太陽能即係板，咁令到整體嗰個嘅太陽能嗰個嘅。

344
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:58,480
唔係咩好先進科技咯，亦都係同埋太陽能板嗰個嘅成本越嚟越低咧。家下即係佢佢佢每平方米即係每平方米嗰個發電嗰個嘅能量，亦都越嚟越高啦。咁所以嗰個成本效益，即係譬如同當年興建機場嗰陣時已經好唔同㗎啦。咁所以如果即係可以考慮呢一方面一。

345
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:43,510
Yes, certainly. Certainly, as I said, for the midfield which only just opened, so that's the new technology, not the original. Just in the last few years, we've opened that new technology, and it's it's certainly efficient to an extent. And you're right, we believe that they will become more efficient, and we will continue to to implement.希望稍後機管局。

346
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:18,920
二號客運大樓裏邊所講嘅一啲方向咧，誒，我我唔知。其實頭先我問個問題就係話，你會唔會有一個時間表咧，係應用喺第一號一號貨運大樓上邊，即係令到咧遊客咧唔使等到二零二三年喺二號貨運大樓先至可以向得到。咁所以我我第一個就想搞清楚就係話咧，即係究竟呢啲方。

347
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:38,930
嘅應用咧，係一號貨嘅碼一號客運站個應用嘅情況、時間表進度會係點樣樣？有冇一啲嘅基準，等我哋都睇得到？就係話咧，即係呢啲唔係話要因為喺所謂新世起三跑嘅時候，你先會做，其實而家都做緊㗎啦。咁但係個進展係點樣樣咧？第一個，第二個，我想係確認翻頭先我問嗰個問題，就因為即係。

348
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:58,940
剛才總裁講啦，就係話誒二號舊嘅二號貨二號客運大樓咧，其實就唔係啲咩拆卸嚟嘅，係即係保留六成嘅面積啦。咁其他就會再加建啊，再令到成為一個full service嘅係terminal噉樣樣。我想你畀翻嗰個實際嘅即係變化嘅情況，因為裏邊原先有啲嘢有嘅，而家可能會因為你你個新嗰件冇咗都。

349
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:18,950
唔定有啲嘢係冇要加上去都唔定。咁呢個加減之間有啲咩變化，同埋呢個變化嗰個嘅係牽涉到成本係點樣嘅一回事，可唔可以提供我哋資料啫？多謝主席。我諗第一個問題啊，頭先答過嘅，不嚟行出行入就冇。我知我冇辦法，就隔離開緊發展啦。噉就第二個問題啊，好早以前。

350
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:38,960
前都有個圖出咗嘅，畀你睇嘅。咁或者你又行出行又冇睇到，不？總裁你再答個啦。好，噉啊，誒，第一個咧，我哋其實頭先講嘅一啲，我哋依家講緊啲理念咧，有啲新嘅，好似你話我哋嗰個買flight啊，誒，我哋講緊個行李嗰個誒自動行李處理誒，嗰嗰邊嗰個空搬踢啊，依啲等等咧，我哋希望嚟緊嗰一

351
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:58,970
兩年都會陸續推出。其實有個自助，或者我哋依家可以話自助嗰個行李櫃位咧，響下個月已經會推出啦。咁所以有好多我哋講嘅呢啲噉嘅科技咧，嚟緊呢兩年咧會陸陸續續響我哋一號誒嗰個客運廊咧就會會會有㗎啦。咁當然呢啲科技會隨住未來嘅改進，會逐步再進一步提升。

352
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:29,340
可唔可以定一個基準話畀我聽，即係譬如現現時嗰個嘅係一號貨一號客運廊嗰個嘅係即係旅客嗰個誒方便嘅程度，有個因為呢度有寫㗎嘛，你都會係有一個叫基準同表現指標係畀呢個二號客客運大樓㗎嘛。咁會唔會就同樣嘅指標畀一號客運大樓，然後睇到你呢啲嘅？

353
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:16,590
好嘛，同時有冇其他問題？

354
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,990
咁呢方面，我哋陸續都會有計劃係推出嘅。

355
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,760
O K，噉就誒，多謝各位出席。

356
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:34,130
有冇其他問題咧？下次誒會議咧就喺四月十二日誒星期二嘅上午十時至誒十時四十五分至十二時四十五分，係討論珠三角誒州嘅空域嘅相關事。

357
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:49,350
嘅科技應用嘅時間咧，個改善嘅情況啊！我我哋好希望咧，就其實我哋依家咧，就嗰個係誒依家我哋做嘅所有嘢都係達到嗰個基本指標嘅。我哋希望做咗呢啲之後咧，唔會令到個指標下跌。因為點解咧？就越嚟越多人啦。咁想喺呢方面嚟講個考要提升嘅話咧，如果唔係靠誒加。

358
01:26:49,350 --> 01:27:09,360
多啲人擴大嗰個地方嘅話，就要靠響科技方面，靠其他嘅啲手段，令到嗰個指標本身咧唔會下跌。噉我哋嘅嗰個目標就係要繼續維持咧，我哋會達到我哋依家嘅所謂嘅嗰個指標。誒噉，所以嚟緊嗰一兩年咧，咁當然咧，另外一方面有啲就同指標無關，有啲先係純粹想提升嗰啲誒旅客本身響機場嘅體驗。
