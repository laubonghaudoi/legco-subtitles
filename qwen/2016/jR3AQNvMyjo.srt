00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,860
郭榮亨，粵，多謝主席。主席，正如我誒。

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,680
開始開手嘅時候都講啊，就係。

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:21,930
知識產權同一般嘅業權咧係好唔同。知識產權咧係一個好獨特嘅一個誒誒法律嘅權利。

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:31,820
佢亦都係保障一個概念嘅表達，而唔係單單係一個概念，係一個概念嘅表達。咁所以咧喺處理依一方面嘅。

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:55,380
所以咧喺處理依一方面嘅法律問題嘅時候，我哋必須要好小心噉樣去認清咧啊呢一個知識產權佢嘅獨特性。咁頭先我講到喺上議院嗰度咧，喺大家喺度討論究竟呢一個限制合約凌駕性嘅時候咧，點解英國政府要提出？

6
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:15,390
呢一個啊嘅啊啊法例咧，去限制合約凌駕性咧，其實都有好多考慮。咁其中一樣嘢咧，就係頭先入誒頭先我未講到嘅咧，就係誒呢一個Baroness Neville Ruffell咧喺呢一個啊上議院二誒七月二十九號二零一四年嘅法。

7
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:31,120
言裏邊咧，佢就咁講嘅。佢就話：Ensuring that the personal copying exception cannot be overridden by contract terms will mean that consumers are given clarity and certainty over what they can do with the media they buy.

8
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,290
most people assume that the law already allows them to make the type of personal copies covered by our legislation.

9
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:58,710
very few people read the detailed licensing terms that accompany digital downloads. We want the goods, so we just tend to accept the terms. Ensuring that the new law on personal copying applies in all circumstances, regardless of contract and licensing terms, will bring much needed.

10
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,130
Clarity to the law and fairness for consumer.

11
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:22,460
forconsumers，whichIwelcome。嗱呢一段咧非常之重要，亦都係帶出咗點解我想提呢一個限制合約凌價性嘅重要。咁其實英國政府咧亦都意識到就係，當你喺網上去訂購一啲誒誒知識產權或者誒誒受知識產權保護嘅一啲誒。

12
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:36,840
物品嘅時候，譬如一首歌或者一本書等等，其實好少人會真係去睇嗰個條款嘅，究竟誒Apple或者其他網上平台誒，佢係咩嘅條款去？

13
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:57,490
賣畀你啦，係咪限制你係用呢一個法律賦予你嘅一啲闊面咧？其實根本上唔會有人睇好多時，你淨係啊睇到嗰個terms and conditions嗰個格格仔噉，你就去撳一下accept。根本上大部分人咧都唔會同你研究細讀呢一個。

14
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:14,870
啊！網上邊買翻嚟嘅一啲啊物品咧，佢哋究竟係有啲咩附帶條件？噉就係正正英國政府咧，就係睇到呢一點，就係想保護一般小市民唔會受到官司無謂嘅官司影響，所以佢就。

15
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:35,500
會帶入咗呢一個限制合約靈活性嘅需要啦。咁例如確保啲咩咧？頭先兩個字係重複重複都出現嘅喺上議院嘅嘅辯論裏邊，就係clarity and certainty，clarity to the law，就係個法例要係好清晰嘅，好清晰就係唔會話啊原來你法例畀我。

16
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:55,510
嘅豁免係可以A、B、C公司透過佢嘅合約咧，係攞走咗，而我又唔好明點解喎？明明個法律就畀咗我，咁點解你又可以唔畀我用？跟住最後仲告到我上法庭咧？咁呢個就係clarity to the law啦。更加重要嘅一個公眾利益要考慮嘅誒誒範疇咧，就係。

17
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,980
Fairness for consumers，你對一般嘅。

18
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:10,940
啊啊！買呢個產品嘅嘅嘅公眾，對於消費者，你一定要係清清楚、易明同埋咧係公平。

19
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:29,990
咁所以我提出呢一個合約啊限制合約凌駕性咧，就係為咗保護啊一啲對法律可能唔係話太個認識，甚至係對法律有啲認識，但係咧對於版權法或者知識產權法咧係認識唔夠深嘅人咧，其實可能都會中招嘅。

20
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:40,870
好多時咧，我哋律師之間去討論啊知識版權咧，其實都會講話，其實啊，你唔係依一方面嘅專家，我我又唔係好熟喎。咁其實就算喺法律界啊，

21
00:04:41,150 --> 00:05:01,160
可能對於知識產權咧，都唔係個個係啊啊啊好清楚明白當中嘅法例同概念。如果係噉嘅話，一般公眾買咗一啲產品翻嚟，你點可以期望佢會理解喺法律上佢有啲咩嘅豁免，有啲咩嘅權利咧？

22
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,100
所以呢個限制合約零加成咧，係真係有一個好重大嘅公眾利益咧，係喺背後嘅。

23
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,690
咁好多嗯。

24
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:31,110
啊！同時咧都講到就係話啊，咁誒，其實版權擁有人誒誒反對咁誒，呢個係侵害佢哋嘅利益噉。但係我哋唔可以淨係下下好似特區政府噉樣咧，只係識去聽版權擁有人被佢哋牽著鼻子咧係四處走就。

25
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:51,120
係話啊！我哋提出呢個修訂，但係版權擁有人企硬噉，我哋政府咧就唔做啦。我哋提出呢一個中間方案，有限度嘅公平使用版權擁有人接受，所以我哋就唔能夠做啦。正係正如頭先我讀李誌喜資深大律師佢嗰個聲明嘅時候咧，佢都話其實喺制定呢一個法律。

26
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,530
制定呢個版權嘅政策嘅時候，係絕對唔能夠畀一個持份者、一班持份者。

27
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,320
去單獨。

28
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:13,540
向政府話你可以做啲乜，你可以立啲咩法，唔可以立啲咩法。呢一個唔係一個負責任政府嘅做法，亦都唔需要係被一班。

29
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:33,890
記得利益者咧係完全操控咗政府喺呢一方面嘅政策，政府要考慮嘅最終係公眾利益。咁喺英國上議院咧，其實都講到contract override嘅時候咧，其實有其他嘅持份者咧係，譬如一啲公營機構咧，佢哋咧都係支持。

30
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,700
呢一個啊誒？

31
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,190
合約。

32
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,980
合約凌駕性嘅條款。

33
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,320
咁點解咧？就係呢一個誒。

34
00:06:44,600 --> 00:07:03,150
我以下落嚟咧就讀一讀，就係呢一個英國議院咧喺誒度辯論，應該就係第四十一號報告咧，係向個誒即係小組委員會向個誒議會報告嘅第四十一號報告裏邊咧，第二十一段咧就有講到啦，contract override。

35
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:24,050
The draft regulations contain provisions which seek to ensure that users can rely on copyright exemptions despite contract terms to the contrary. Several of the submissions to the committee, for example, these from the Alliance for Intellectual Property, the British Copyright Council, the Motion Picture Association, voiced concerns about the acceptability.

36
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:44,060
and workability of the contract override provisions嗱，呢度都係嘅。英國政府咧都係收到佢哋當地嘅誒版權大聯盟同埋誒英國嘅版權商會同埋呢個Motion Picture Association，即係香港我哋成日都有見到嘅佢哋嘅NPA嘅代表咧，其實佢哋都。

37
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:56,800
反對嘅，佢哋都話：喂，你呢個限制合約零價性係對我哋誒係好好麻煩嘅，得唔得㗎？做唔做到㗎？噉樣咁英國政府咧都係收到同樣嘅壓力。

38
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:17,100
啊，嚟自依個版權擁有人噉，但係咧，佢就咁講啦。We discussed these concerns in our evidence session and pressed for an explanation of the justification which the government saw for such generic provisions which would cut across the normal operation of contractual agreements between producers and users. Ficquel。

39
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:37,110
Younger and Miss Hayes told us that the effect of the provisions would not be retrospective, but would apply only to new contracts, and that the new provisions were precedented in as much as an existing exception allowing material to be photocopied in schools could not be overridden by contractual terms.

40
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:57,340
We note in this regard that the submission sent to us by the British Library and the Wellcome Trust both support both support the contract override provisions. The British Library has commented that without this protection, every user of a digital resource in the library is expected to read.

41
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:17,350
what each contract allows or disallows嗱，好得意啦！你呢度睇到嗰個分歧啦，就係當一啲版權擁有人咧，佢哋一定係反對嘅，佢哋一定係話：，我誒合約自主，我係有權去定立我哋自己嘅條款係點樣。即係英國係噉，香港又係噉樣。咁英國政府面對嘅壓力咧。

42
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:34,210
來自版權擁有人一樣係嘅，不過當你睇到一啲好似公營機構，好似British Library，佢哋都係持有好多版權嘅嘅一個版權擁有，不過係一個公營機構，噉佢哋就話啦，嗱，平情而論，如果冇咗依個噉樣嘅保護膜嘅話咧，

43
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,590
每一次。

44
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:54,460
一個市民，一個用者，佢嚟到一個公共圖書館去讀一啲嘢，或者喺網上買一啲嘢嘅時候，每一次佢都要睇一睇，究竟個合約嗰個細則係咪限制佢喺法例底下所享有嘅一啲啊？

45
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:14,810
權利同埋豁免係咪？我唔可以用嚟做誒研究咧？係咪我唔可以用嚟做誒教育咧？係咪我唔可以用嚟做誒誒戲仿咧、諷刺啦等等嘅一啲本身法例已經畀咗我嘅權利，而私人公司咧係可以透過私人合約係拎走。

46
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:35,210
咁呢個就係我哋作為立法者要決定嘅咩啦嘅地方啦，就係作為一個立法者，我哋認為政府嘅政策喺立例嘅時候，應唔應該完全充分咁保護消費者、一般市民，等佢哋唔使每一次都要擔驚受怕去睇嗰個合約條款裏邊有冇去。

47
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:44,460
剝削佢哋喺法例本身作為一個公共政策，已經係賦予咗畀佢哋嘅一個啊，呢一個啊豁免權。

48
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:58,390
咁如果我哋覺得係應該係挨去呢一個公眾同埋挨去呢一個消費者嗰邊嘅權權利，保護公眾嘅權利嘅時候，其實政府係唔應該下下都要聽。

49
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:19,030
嗰啲版權擁有人佢哋嘅意見，因為版權擁有人當然佢哋嘅出發點就係保護佢哋自己嘅利益，呢個完全可以理解。但係問題政府唔能夠係就住因為版權擁有人咧係反對咧而係唔敢行出呢一步，正正就係當年英國政。

50
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:37,060
政府都頂受住呢一個壓力，去做一個佢認為應該做嘅嘢。點解我哋香港政府唔能夠同樣去行出呢一步咧？佢有冇問過版權擁有人究竟為我成立咗呢一個定立咗呢一個誒合約零加成？

51
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,580
呢個條款。

52
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:49,730
會點樣傷害你嗰個版權人嘅利益啊？你有冇啲實質嘅例子、實質嘅數據話畀我聽？究竟你擔心？

53
00:11:50,310 --> 00:12:10,320
你嘅利利益係會受到點樣嘅傷害？反而喺香港，我哋同啲版權擁有人開會傾偈嘅時候，我直情問佢：你可唔可以畀一啲例子我？就係你認為有咗呢個誒限制合約凌駕性嘅條款喺法例香港法例出現之後，會點樣影響你而家嘅合約？

54
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,530
會點樣影響你而家嘅合約裏邊嘅條款？會點樣影響你盤生意？

55
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,610
冇一個答到我。

56
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:38,860
佢能只能夠係指出話啊，可能我同一啲網上平台去傾嘅時候咧，可能誒就變咗我有啲合約嘅條款，但係嗰啲係網上商業平台啊嘛，講緊，但係而家係講緊一啲私人做戲房啊，係二次創作啊等等嘅，其實呢啲根本上已經係跌咗入去公平市。

57
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,630
用公平公平處理嘅嘅範疇裏邊嘅啦嘛。

58
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:52,510
咁又點樣影響到你咧？唔通你真係諗住入落一啲新嘅條款去限制人哋用公平使用誒嘅嘅啊氣房嘅闊面咩？

59
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,690
佢又話：未諗到。

60
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:07,980
咁即係其實佢哋係又睇又唔係話真係覺得自睇唔到自己嘅利益係點樣受到損害，又睇唔到佢哋而家嗰啲合約條款係點樣受到影響，但係佢就話我要。

61
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,310
頂住呢一個位，我唔要畀你，連我合約嘅訂立嘅自由都。

62
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:34,600
都畀我影響，我一定要留住呢個位，等我第時可能有需要，我而家諗唔到，但係有需要嘅時候咧，我就會落一啲條款咧，係唔畀你享有一啲法例上賦予你嘅豁免。咁呢個就正正最令人擔心，就係究竟佢哋會點樣去利用一啲私人合約去剝削一般。

63
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:46,870
市民嘅豁免權，令到佢哋咧可能會中招，令到佢哋咧可能咧係會受到民事啊嘅嘅控訴。咁呢一個係對一般人嚟講咧係。

64
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:57,830
好大嘅一個壓力。噉我哋而家有機會咧，我覺得應該係修改。咁其實局方咧成日都話係原則上唔得，原則上唔得。其實法理上又肯定得做到。

65
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:13,160
連大律師公會都唔係話誒，一定係即係誒呢個有限制零誒合約零價性嘅條款咧，就就喺法律上做唔到。其實法律上係做到嘅，個問題係應唔應該做？呢一個就係立法者今日要問自己嘅問題。

66
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:33,450
咁誒之前咧有好多議員咧，其實都誒同我講過，就係好擔心，就係佢會有一個誒誒retrospective effect，即係話咧係會唔會淨係向前去誒誒影響一啲誒合約，但係以前嗰啲合約會唔會又追索翻？

67
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,380
有追索性會唔會影響咗佢哋嘅嘅一啲嗯？

68
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:57,710
誒影響咧，譬如我已經有個合約，係有一個誒誒誒條條例係寫明你唔可以誒做一啲乜嘢嘅。咁如果我哋定立咗呢條條例，會唔會影響以前嗰啲合約？嗱，呢一個咧係值得係誒要去正面回應嘅，因為睇翻上議院咧嘅辯論咧，其實咧係有。

69
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:07,870
好多誒誒資深嘅大律師或者法官咧，佢哋都係提出過依一點。噉我下一節咧會係繼續去解釋呢一個誒部分嘅。

70
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,120
寫嚟先啲。

71
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:30,580
Mr. President, at the Council meeting of 4 February, the honourable Claudia Mo expressed disapproval of my view, saying that the current debate of providing contract override provisions have no bearing on the separation of powers, and that it is not proper to force citizens.

72
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,250
under threat of legal challenges.

73
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,970
with due respect。

74
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:42,830
Claudia Mo，judgmental approach to the matter is fundamentally misguided.

75
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,790
她 trip in here the last two days， she would have listened to her side of the story.

76
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,300
as recently as about.

77
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:03,880
Half an hour ago, when the honourable Ellenberg talk about, he talk about the separation of powers, the role of legislators in the making of laws, and earlier.

78
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:12,800
The honourable Ho Jun Yan also talk about the role of legislators, and this is why we are here in the.

79
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:33,090
spirit of separation of powers and what to make of law. Since day one of the debate of this CSA, the pan-democratic have been speaking as if they were judges, assuming is if not adjudicating that netizens, ordinary web users' rights are more transcendent and beyond.

80
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:53,100
在每種情況下，由這條思路出發，他們因此採用一項全面的策略，傾斜平衡向這羣公民一方，而忽略另一羣公民的合法權利，即版權所有者。

81
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:13,590
從 whom this amendment bill aims to safeguard for them and for all others, there is no ambiguity. I repeat, no ambiguity that it is the government policy to protect citizens' right of expression. Meanwhile, there is also government policy to uphold freedom of contract and safeguard.

82
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,010
Copyright's legitimate interests. We lawmakers.

83
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,160
和。

84
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:36,170
政府的義務是尊重這些權利，而不偏袒。而勞社會已經強調，沒有證據顯示現有的版權豁免未能達成預期的益處。

85
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:56,460
only owing to contract override, as it is proportionate to strip copyright owners of their right to freedom of contract because of unwarranted fear of some people. Mr President, the administration has introduced six exemptions for copyright works in the amendment bill, that upon the endorsement by this council.

86
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:08,550
會給 effect the legitimate intent of the administration and the legislature for the protection of nestiums' rights. The six exemptions would become part of the government policy.

87
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:23,760
By incorporating such intent in the amendment ordinance, mightier than recording the intent in the Hansard alone, isn't it a pragmatic and responsible way to discharge our duty as lawmakers?

88
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:35,350
As some of the honourable colleagues have highlighted, it is doubtful that contract terms can override the legitimate intent specified by the amendment bill after passage.

89
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:44,000
We know that as a general rule, certainty in law is preferred, as earlier said by the honourable colleague.

90
00:18:45,580 --> 00:19:05,590
for it makes legal outcome more predictable, which facilitates lawyer to give meaningful advice to their clients. On this ground, it is arguable that the six exemptions for copyright works in the amendment bill, namely parody, satire, pastiche, caricature, quotation.

91
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:18,150
或Reporting of comment on current events lack certainty, as the administration have given no definition for each of these concepts. This make individual nations feel worried.

92
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:38,440
Nevertheless, on the flip side of the coin, certainty implies rigidity. Flexibility of law cannot be stressed too much when it comes to relative novel concepts such as parody, satire, pastiche, caricature, quotation or reporting on current and current events, as these concepts are.

93
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:48,360
Still developing and evolving, and giving a precise definition to these ideas is barely possible. As a noteworthy case in point.

94
00:19:48,640 --> 00:20:08,650
On the meaning of parody itself, the European Council has given no definition on the concept of parody, and the European Court of Justice have ruled that the application on the exception for parody must strike a fair balance between the interests and rights of the rights holders and the freedom of expression of the user.

95
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:25,330
preserve a fair balance, all the circumstances of the case must be taken into account. In practice, in order to satisfy the fair balance test, it will be for the national courts to decide whether an expression of on

96
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:40,010
Of humour or mockery is in fact discriminatory. If a parody conveys a discriminatory message, for example, by replacing the original character of people wearing masks or people of colour,

97
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:50,680
The holders of the rights to the work parody have, in principle, legitimate interests in ensuring that their work is not associated with such a message.

98
00:20:51,270 --> 00:21:11,280
It seems sensible that the European Court of Justice did not lay down any set criteria to make this assessment, given the social and cultural differences that exist between member states. By the same token, why can't we give the court more leeway to wait and consider on a case-to-case basis?

99
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:31,290
subject to metrics of the facts, between protecting freedom of contract and freedom of expression, it is up to the court to decide which one should prevail in each case, without the preconception and prejudgment that either individualness right or copy owner's right must be transcendent. Why should

100
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:47,720
如果我們能step in the jurisdiction of the judiciary by incorporating the intent in the amendment bill, a proper balance would be struck. After all, Article 140 of the Basic Law specifically requires the government.

101
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:57,240
「to protect by law the achievements and the lawful rights and interests of authors in their literary and artistic creation。」

102
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:15,900
even in the worst case, even if the worst comes to the worst, the copyright owners would act in bad faith by deliberating incorporating terms in future contracts with nassiums in blatant defiance of the legislative intent and taking away the legitimate rights of the nassiums.

103
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,490
It is improbable that the court would simply accept the wording in those terms at its face value.

104
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:42,780
作為規則，法院會非常抗拒接受任何限制，或甚至移除個別權利，包含在條例中。更別提《基本法》第27條所明確規定的權利，即香港居民應享有言論自由、新聞自由及出版自由。《基本法》第27條。

105
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:53,420
34、，That Hong Kong residents shall have freedom to engage in academic research, literary and artistic creation and other cultural activities.

106
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,920
Post black.

107
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:09,080
In addition, section 192, Act 3 of the existing copyright ordinance also reaffirms the court's jurisdiction to prevent or restrict the enforcement of copyright on the ground of public interest.

108
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:19,930
在處理涉及合約條款，旨在限制或移除個別從現有法例權利時，法院將把舉證責任推給申請人。

109
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:33,430
括號，the copyright owner and close括號，that the claimant must prove that such terms are properly incorporated with communication conducted with the particular attention drawn to the defendant.

110
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:43,450
提名人必須也 convince法院，，使用上述用詞來限制或移除權利是合理的，，因為香港的法律體係。

111
00:23:43,790 --> 00:24:03,800
originated from the British legal system, that the later is moving away from the the Latin word is I don't know how to pronounce it, survey tempter. That is to let the buyer beware. Close bracket, but to promoting consumer rights in particular in cases where there is an eco

112
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:23,810
bargaining power between parties to a contract, it would be outrageous to imagine that the court permitting copyright owner relying on some unreasonable terms improperly incorporated in the contract only to strive away nestiums right guarantee under exemptions of the amendment bill and the relevant provisions of.

113
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:42,090
Existing copyright ordinance and the basic law, Mr President, the issue in contention is pertinent to the doctrine of separation of power. Perhaps Claudia, more better read the the the basic law and the ordinance, copyright ordinance.

114
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,800
has not been aware of, just pretended not to have been aware of.

115
00:24:48,080 --> 00:25:08,090
自移交以來，隨著強化政治極端化，政府與對立陣營之間，以及支持現有政權的陣營與反對民主的陣營之間，議會的聲望持續下降。越來越多的人對政府顯露出不滿。

116
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:28,100
And trust in this council and the government. This is indeed pathetic, since the two limbs of the separation, the legislature and the executive, are overwhelmed by a divisive and cynical atmosphere. A piece of legislation submitted by the executive is very often not judged on its merits, but on

117
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,350
政治基礎，或甚至政治計算，由一些榮譽成員。

118
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:43,050
Earlier, the honourable Ellen Leung was talking. It is a government they don't want. I must say here is a government that we have.

119
00:25:43,330 --> 00:26:03,340
我們有選舉，根據基本法，它是我們的法律政府。就這項修訂法案而言，支持者和反對者關於提供合約修訂條款等其他問題的分歧，並未被縮窄。

120
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,160
It has no signs to be narrowed, even after the recent effort of a four-party meeting.

121
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:29,450
Mr. President, the pan democrats' panic seems overdone. If the Honourable Claudio and the pan democrats don't treat this government for fear of more political prosecution, to ensure that the passage of this

122
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,160
所謂的

123
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:52,380
As reiterated apprehensively by the Honorable Jang Gook-chee in his speech on 24 February, then they should trust then they should trust the court's independence and impartiality by the court's affirmative disregard for the considerable.

124
00:26:52,830 --> 00:27:12,840
for the consideration the consideration of the of the people whom they have, whom people have relied on them. Mr. President, I concur with the honourable Marfongkong that we should not create confrontation between nassions and copyright owner. It is unjust to demonise the copyright.

125
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,470
Owners who do not deserve.

126
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:31,450
No nations and copyright owners are above the law, and no nations and copyright owner are below it. That render to the legislature the things that we are the legislatures, and to the court that the things that are to the court. Thank you.

127
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,670
主席。

128
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:56,960
我喺上一次嘅發言裏邊咧，都提到誒二零一二年嘅《大愛香港》呢首歌，即係G大調同埋山卡拉嘅創作，係基於謝安琪嗰首歌之後引致到環球唱片公司咧，係要求誒YouTube將呢一首。

129
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:16,970
首歌咧下架噉，其實呢個都係一個即係好清楚嘅事例，去睇到網民或者啲二次創作者，佢要二次創作嘅時候，因為一啲版權嘅條例而令到佢嘅創作咧係失去咗呢個發揮，失去咗連一個。

130
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:36,980
個完全係非牟利，完全係以即係鼓勵香港人啊悼念我哋呢件事，同埋鼓勵香港人逆境自強嘅一個噉嘅二次創作咧，都要下架嘅。如果呢一個合約凌價係可以將法例賦予佢。

131
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:45,230
嗰六個嘅豁免都可以唔需要履行嘅話，呢個絕對係對二次創作嘅一個打擊。

132
00:28:45,510 --> 00:29:00,940
而此而且二次創作人咧，其實真係好多時係會用呢一啲嘅誒原本嘅物料，在二次創作嘅時候咧，佢係可以發揮到好多嘅作用。譬如今朝早啊，國家琦議員佢提到。

133
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,090
即係我哋香港有一批二次創作嘅誒。

134
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:25,380
誒，其實而家已經成為版權人㗎啦。譬如話誒，林夕啦、黃偉文啦，有仲有誒一啲漫畫家，譬如江記啦、雀雀與貓叔啦、東尼電機啦等等。佢哋而家係版權擁有人嚟㗎啦，但係佢哋曾經都經歷過呢啲二次創作嘅階段。

135
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:33,040
所以佢哋都好撐，今次咧要畀到一啲實質嘅保障，畀呢啲二次創作人。

136
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:47,370
嗱，主席，我當然好同意郭嘉琪嘅講法啦，但係我想補充落去咧，就係我想我要問大家，唔知有冇睇過一篇叫做《激嬲女朋友》，佢叫我扮比卡超同佢溝通嘅一篇文章。

137
00:29:47,750 --> 00:30:07,760
噉啊！呢篇文章咧就主席係一啲誒網絡嘅潮文嚟嘅，孔明寫嘅。噉啊，呢篇文喺高登度發表咗，噉啊，即係好有趣。之後咧就畀阿達個就一路打機，串流打機，即係喺上網嘅時候。

138
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,800
就一路講翻個古仔出嚟。

139
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,430
咁阿達哥係誒。

140
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,840
達個唔知主席你識唔識啦？即係係一個網絡嘅紅人。

141
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:37,130
佢嘅將呢股股史講出嚟之後咧，大大大受歡迎。咁跟住咧就有好多嘅再創作啦。譬如有啲人會畫啲圖出嚟，因為佢入邊嗰個故事咧就係關於呢個比卡超嘅。噉啊，有啲人畫畫啦，有啲人畫漫畫啦。咁有兩個。

142
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:49,540
個漫畫家咧就誒黎特咧，另外就連同阿陸永咧，陸永你知啊，即係農夫嗰個，而家都有唱歌啊、表演，即係喺大台都有嘅。

143
00:30:49,820 --> 00:31:09,830
噉啊，仲有薛可正咧，佢就將呢個故事咧變成一個動畫，同埋陸永咧就即係自己飾演嗰個主人翁。噉我睇過喺YouTube度呢個故事，我覺得好好笑嘅，即係當然係好無釐頭啦。但係佢裏邊咧就牽涉到即係呢啲噉樣嘅圖像，咁呢個。

144
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,580
個就係。

145
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:23,290
誒嗰個古仔，噉佢而家簡稱叫誒比卡超B，噉啊，即係話誒激嬲女朋友，佢逼我同呢個誒，即係扮呢個比卡超同我同佢溝通呢個古仔啦。

146
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,080
咁呢個故事咧，而家係大受歡迎嘅。

147
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,500
喺YouTube度好多人睇，誒，亦都係即係其實呢個咧，主席。

148
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:53,990
係我哋今時今日年輕人嗰種嘅誒網上文化，佢哋就，我認為張耀唔唔使咁細緻去描繪呢個故事嘅內容。好啊，你講佢同呢個我哋而家嗰個收結我點樣講？重點咧就係在於呢個picasso咧。

149
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,790
其實係有版權㗎嘛。

150
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:06,870
誒，我所理解就係應該任天堂。嗱，任天堂咧，好彩暫時都未曾要求YouTube將呢個故事下架。

151
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:27,160
但係，如果好似環球噉樣，佢要求嗰個誒大愛香港下架，噉就下架㗎咯。好彩佢揾翻周柏賢，咁周柏賢就好好，即係佢都係一個創作人，佢畀個另外一個版本，佢就做到啦。但係呢啲正我主席，我想指出呢個係香港人。

152
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:47,170
而家一種嘅生活方式，佢哋會喺網上面搞啲無釐頭嘢，用一啲現有嘅可能已經有版權嘅一啲嘅誒誒characters啊，呢啲即係卡通人物啊，或者其他嘅一啲嘅故事啊，譬如話誒，我我哋有誒人用呢個迪士尼。

153
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:55,660
寺嚟樂園啊，轉咗用一個佛教嘅形式去即係惡搞啊，咁呢啲咧，其實正正就係即係大家睇咗好過癮。

154
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:15,960
睇完好過癮之後咧，其實可能就住呢一度咧，係畀到大家一種娛樂之外咧，其實都係發揮咗我哋今天年輕人嗰個創作嘅能力嘅。我都想將呢個漫畫家阿黎特個創作誒《Bikachu B》嗰個部分嘅感受讀出嚟，係想講翻畀我哋啲官員聽啊！

155
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:25,920
呢一個由郭阿郭榮亨議員提出嚟呢一個誒要限制合約零間呢一樣嘢咧，嗰個重要性。

156
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:46,280
嗱，佢就咁講嘅。佢話創作呢個《皮卡丘B》嘅個感受嘅時候咧，佢話我哋咧其實各有正職，仍然咧係願意落手落腳咁去做呢件事，而一蚊都唔會收得到嘅，因為我哋係真心中意呢種二次惡搞文化嘅戲約創作，真心欣賞廣東話語境，無可。

157
00:33:46,280 --> 00:34:06,290
可取代嘅搞笑韻律，真心樂於參與呢一件滑滑突突無釐頭，但係充滿美感嘅事。而呢啲嘅動機咧，唔係因為威威逼理由，或者係強行再教育之下而產生嘅。所以主席唔通，我哋好嘅故事、好嘅創作要畀。

158
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:26,300
呢啲版權法去去扼殺咧，唔通我哋政府淨係識得聽呢啲版權大聯盟、啲版權人嘅意見？對於我哋新生代呢啲其實二次創作人，佢哋將來都可能變成版權人嘅，但係佢哋嗰個創作嘅聲音，佢哋創作嘅空間係要聽呢種，係我哋嘅生活方式。

159
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,750
真係我哋後生仔嘅一種文化嚟嘅。

160
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,860
噉，主席。

161
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:50,280
即係誒，除咗呢一個而家網上興嗰個文化之外咧，我哋亦都明白喺個合約個條款度係好複雜嘅，而有英國或者其他國家，主要係英國啦，佢哋點解會引入咗呢一個郭榮亨議員提？

162
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:10,290
出嘅概念，即係要限制呢個合約零價咧，就因為佢哋做過一啲研究嘅，譬如英國嘅誒The Library and Archives Copyright Alliance，佢哋做咗一個超過一百份合約嘅分析，佢就發覺主要嘅呢啲咧，全部都係同英。

163
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:24,460
英國圖書館有關嘅一啲合約嚟嘅，佢就發覺呢啲嘅合約裏邊牽涉到好多嘅誒牌照或者合約嘅細節咧，嗰種嘅零價咧係。

164
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,450
細節同埋分散，佢係冇辦法咧，將佢好簡單噉樣。

165
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,480
包入一個闊面嘅情況底下。

166
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:53,790
咁所以即係佢哋嘅結，佢哋嘅結論咧就係話，其實呢一個要限制合約零價呢一個嘅條款咧係非常之重要。冇咗呢種條款咧，其實我哋一般嘅市民或者誒網民或者一啲買產品嘅使用者，甚至買一啲。

167
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,620
誒，我哋有copyright嘅誒，可能學術或者。

168
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,980
冇意思。

169
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:11,110
或者其他嘅一啲誒喺圖書館會誒我哋借到嘅物品咧，都會出現一種佢可能。

170
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,930
唔多發網嘅情況，咁所以主席即係我覺得。

171
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:36,260
啊！郭榮亨議員提出今次呢一個嘅概念咧，係非常之合理。而老實講，如果我哋時時刻刻都要限制住呢啲創作，如果我哋淨係掛住誒版權人嘅利益而，

172
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:56,270
諗住啊！呢啲利益咧就係誒要受到保障，但係其實嗰個原創者佢往往唔係想噉樣嘅。個原創者可能根本就係想呢件事咧多啲人去分享，而尤其是我哋講緊呢六個闊面裏邊咧，係唔牽涉到。

173
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,320
商業嘅行為嚟㗎嘛？呢啲講到明係非商業性，唔係賺錢嘅。

174
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:22,620
咁點可能會畀一啲私人之間嘅合約，或者一啲公司與用者，或者公司與消費者之間嘅一啲合約而限制咗佢咧？點解呢啲嘅保障明明係賦予你都唔係用呢一個版權嚟到牟利嘅？

175
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:37,520
而你用嘅目的咧，就係正正而家我哋版權法都承認應該畀你豁免嘅，但係竟然係可以畀合約凌駕嘅，呢個係即係講唔通啊嘛！咁所以主席。

176
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,590
我哋睇闊少少，即係而家有一啲嘅誒。

177
00:37:43,960 --> 00:38:03,970
誒出邊嘅有軟件嘅一啲甚至娛樂嘅公司咧，其實有時佢未必係需要搞到樣樣都限制住。周柏然係一個好嘅例子啦，黃偉文係一個好嘅例子啦，林夕係一個好嘅例子，呢啲都係我哋好近香港嘅。

178
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:13,100
遠少少，誒，我唔知主席你有冇聽過韓國有個歌手叫Psy，誒，PSY Psy，噉佢有首歌好勁，叫《江南Style》。

179
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:21,790
呢首歌咧，講你都唔信。而家喺網上YouTube啊，網上累積嘅瀏覽次數超過二十五億啊！

180
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:40,460
二十五億人次，即係講講出嚟嚇死人。咁點可能會有一個咁多人會睇過佢呢個即係呢呢首誒音樂M V嚟嘅？有乜可能咧？其實最重要嘅原因咧，就係因為呢一個嘥呢位歌手嗰個。

181
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,730
公司啊，佢願意。

182
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,020
豁免咗個版權，佢任大家去分享。

183
00:38:49,320 --> 00:39:09,330
咁當然啦，阿曬同埋佢跳個舞，即係佢有種叫做騎馬舞，好好特別，好即係誒值得睇，即係好精彩。咁但係主要就係個流通量，佢係冇限制嗰個版權。咁喺佢呢個出版咗誒擺咗上YouTube。

184
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:29,340
之後咧，其實係經過咗好多出名嘅人幫手去推廣，譬如話誒喺美國有黑人歌手T-Pain咧喺佢Twitter度提提咗出嚟啦，跟住有啲social blogger有個叫Gawker好好紅嘅人啦，之後咧啲大誒國際級嘅嘅明星，譬如Britney Spears、Katy Perry。

185
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:47,310
Tom Cruise呢啲人咧都引誒引，即係擺喺佢哋嗰啲誒Twitter嗰度分享。你諗下，Katy Perry一個人嘅追隨者有二千五百萬人嘅咁呢個噉嘅影片，每日噉樣分享，一路噉樣發放，咪即係爆紅咯。

186
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,140
所以主席，我個意思就係。

187
00:39:50,430 --> 00:40:10,440
其實啲版權持有人使唔使咁狹窄，淨係諗住點樣樣處處就誒保障曬，而佢哋嘅合約咧係可以分分鐘咧凌駕咗法例賦予呢啲消費者同埋網民或者甚至一般市民嘅保障咧？點解緊張？

188
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:30,450
將到咁交關咧，其實呢啲版權佢死攬住，咪即係將個流通量減少。我哋睇下，即係最近都搞到連生日快樂嗰首歌都要爭版權。你話如果真係嗰個嗰首歌畀個個唱片公司攞咗個版權，即係全世界唔唱得，你話？

189
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,260
係咪荒謬同滑稽？

190
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:52,550
即係呢個所謂版權或者呢啲所謂知識產權，其實係兩麪人嚟嘅。一面我哋當然明白，你創作者要受到保障，以免佢嘅創作嘅誒產品，佢付出嘅努力，到最後畀人騎劫。

191
00:40:52,550 --> 00:41:12,560
畀人剝奪，而事實上佢就反而得唔到一個好嘅報酬，因此可能噉樣會減輕咗佢嘅創作嘅誒動機。但係講真啦，主席有好多人嘅創作咧，唔係因為錢嘅。張遠其實你講嘅大部分內容都應該係喺二。

192
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:32,570
讀辯論嘅嘅發現，係噉，但係今次其實我哋呢一個嘅誒有關合約凌駕嘅辯論咧，其實都適合㗎嘛。即係點解你會容許？點解我哋嘅政府係淨係聽呢啲版權持有人嘅聲音，就係話：哦，你哋啲合約如果真係

193
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,020
要凌駕咗呢啲誒闊面嘅話咧，係容許嘅。點解咧？

194
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:52,950
點解要即係走一個咁窄嘅路？點解一當我哋呢條法例裏邊牽涉到有刑事有民事嘅責任嘅時候，點解我哋唔可以開放啲聽下社會上面唔同嘅意見咧？

195
00:41:53,530 --> 00:42:05,500
呢個呢個噉樣嘅郭榮亨議員提出呢個修訂，唔係冇例可援嘅。你話哦，有呢樣就唔可以搞誒公平使用。

196
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:25,790
誒是但一樣冇問題，可以商量嘅，唔係話一定要樣樣都攞曬。我哋民主派提出幾個修訂，我哋唔係話所有嘢都一定要過曬，我哋先過啊嘛。我哋都係講道理㗎，我都都係同你講話。喂，嗱，你畀得呢樣嗰樣唔畀嘅話，咪大。

197
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:40,790
而家坐低傾啦。而家問題就係冇嗰個社會共識。你夾硬嚟，去到呢個階段，仲要堅持？我哋點解要繼續浪費時間呢？我哋咪不如政府早啲退，體面地退。

198
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:58,840
將呢啲合理嘅修訂擺埋落去，再拎個上嚟，仲有時間嘅。我哋唔係話要落後，我哋都好想盡快盡快過到。我哋希望我哋嘅版權咧都係得到一個適當嘅保障，但係唔好扼殺創意。多謝主席。

199
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,980
我可以講易讀嘅嘢，我可以做易讀嗰陣時做嘅嘢，就係規程問題。

200
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,450
二讀嗰陣時做嘅，而家三，而家都可以做嘅。

201
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,720
有請議員返回座位。

202
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,550
分開住。

203
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,330
主席。

204
00:56:43,020 --> 00:57:03,030
誒，我係繼續我喺呢一個第一組修正案裏邊嘅第三次嘅發言，就呢個加入限制合約零價嘅條文，亦都極有可能咧係呢組嘅修正案辯論裏邊最後一次嘅發言啊。咁所以咧，我係誒同第一次第二次發言有少少唔同咧，我係用一個方法咧係去即係去提出。

205
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:23,040
出啲嘅觀點咧，係去駁斥我哋其他議員同事提出嘅論點，特別佢哋係唔贊成呢一個啊加入限制零價合約零價嘅條文嘅嚇噉啊。廖長江議員咧喺早前嘅發言裏邊就話講到豁免合約零價嘅修正案係食得思考，因為咧唔係洪水猛獸。

206
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:43,050
佢亦都認同咧，立約嘅自由咧係可以因為重大嘅公眾利益而受到限制。但係主席，我哋其中一個建基於辯論嘅好唔同嘅理解就係因為點樣係去界定公眾利益同埋立約自由之間呢個界線？因為我好擔心咧，就係我哋唔少嘅議員同事、建制派嘅同事。

207
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,300
對公眾利益嘅界線咧，同香港市民對公眾。

208
00:57:47,770 --> 00:58:07,780
誒呢個利益嘅界線咧係有明顯嘅落差。我哋記得好清楚，去年七月呢個源水事件嗰陣時，我去信畀立法會主席郭夏理咧，係要求暑假加開會議處理呢個源水問題嘅嚇。咁但係民民建聯葉國軒嘅同事咧就同記者講話，立法會只係喺死人冧樓嘅時間咧先至。

209
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:24,040
可以交開會議，就唔認同元水問題或者醜聞咧，係到公眾嘅影響。噉啊，令到咧當其時咧，公眾就認為，即係呢個立法會放暑假權利咧，係重要過即係公眾對元水討論理解嘅權利。

210
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,390
我哋想講就係。

211
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:48,870
喺唔損害記得利益嘅大前提之上，呢個討論咧，實際上版權法本身咧就係要用喺保障公民權利嘅條例，例如美國嘅版權法保障嘅咧就係佢哋憲法所保障嘅公民權利，即係推進科學同埋應用文化嘅進程呢一啲權利咧，係屬於。

212
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,620
重大嘅公眾利益。

213
00:58:50,900 --> 00:59:10,910
但係，我哋廖長江議員提到就話：，一旦條例如果加入咗我哋而家討論嘅限制合約零價嘅條文，就會限制埋版權持有人去提供更加寬鬆合約嘅可能。但係，主席，我哋睇一睇過去香港版權大聯盟一直對幾位議員提出嘅修正案，

214
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:25,720
寸步不讓嘅態度咧，將版權法呢樣本身本來應該係用嚟保障公民權利嘅條例當咗做係保障私有財產嘅法例咧，其實係好難令到香港市民相信咧。

215
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:35,100
呢一班係版權法嘅記得利益者咧，係願意提供係比版權法係更加寬鬆嘅合約嘅條文嘅。

216
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:55,390
主席，我係另外一位同事，即係坐喺我左手邊嘅馬逢國議員喺上一次嘅會議裏邊咧，係回應坐喺我右手邊嘅梁國雄議員，就話版權擁有人唔一定就係不勞而獲、不事生產買版權圖利嘅大財團，又話即使版權商有收購。

217
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:15,400
受版權嘅行為，創作人咧，亦都已經從版權商收到第一層嘅回報。主席，我喺呢度咧，想引用一個嘅事例咧，係去反駁呢一個嘅講法，同埋去論證嘅就係一個咖啡壺嘅例子，因為咧同版權商嘅情況咧係非常之類似，就係平時我哋市民。

218
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:35,410
買一杯咖啡或者買一包咖啡豆嘅價格咧，並唔係由種咖啡豆嘅農夫係決定嘅，因為中間咧仲有採購商、大財團會用低價向一啲咖啡農收購咖啡豆。我哋平時喺市面度買到一包產地係嚟自埃塞俄比亞嘅咖啡豆咧，就係商人喺埃塞俄比亞。

219
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:55,420
唔同嘅莊園採購得翻嚟，再賣畀經銷商，運到去世界各地係去出售。因為一般嘅農夫係冇呢個對外貿易嘅渠道，大財團咧係壟斷咗呢啲貿易嘅渠道，從中係去賺取利潤。採購商、經銷商一層一層噉樣咧係去剝削。

220
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:10,380
咖啡壺，而市民買到一包咖啡豆嘅價錢，亦都因為噉樣咧，係大大提高。我哋而家喺普通咖啡店用三十幾蚊買一杯嘅咖啡咧，其實我哋知道得幾毫子咧，其實係可以落到去咖啡壺嘅手裏邊。

221
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:28,390
主席，我想講嘅就話呢一種嘅剝削喺香港嘅創作人身上邊咧，都係同時持續經常噉樣發生嘅。我自己親自係聽過一位好後生嘅電影編劇嘅遭遇，就係佢經常畀電影公司嘅老闆。

222
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,120
偷橋。

223
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:50,950
佢同老闆賣橋嗰陣時咧，嗰位老闆明明話古仔係唔吸引、冇興趣開拍，但係一個屈美十轉頭咧就用翻同一條橋咧係去開戲。結果呢一位後生年輕嘅編劇咧係一毫子嘅版權費都收唔翻，大嘅公司、大嘅財團為咗節省。

224
01:01:50,950 --> 01:02:04,990
成本欺壓創作人嘅故事呢一啲嘅情況咧，係經常發生嘅。有啲未成名嘅年輕作家更加容易係身受其害。嗰位後生嘅編劇仲同我講，就係話：如果有得畀人拖糧。

225
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,810
已經又好幸福。

226
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:12,500
點解咧？因為起碼仲有機會，仲有一絲嘅機會係收得翻啲錢。

227
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:32,790
主席，所以喺版權嘅問題上邊，如果係冇我哋而家討論嘅限制合約零價噉，版權條例保障版權條例保障緊嘅，只係會係作為採購人嘅版權商獲利嘅，只係版權商同埋作為經銷商嘅網絡中介平台。

228
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,110
係。

229
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:42,990
因為版權商同埋呢啲網絡中介平台係助湧咗將版權作品向外發布，又或者係銷售嘅渠道，即係正如頭先我講。

230
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:47,310
嗰啲大傳台、大財團壟斷咗貿易嘅渠道一樣。

231
01:02:47,590 --> 01:03:06,640
會將作品放喺放上去Facebook啊，當然係比街頭演唱更加能夠接觸多啲嘅觀眾。創作人咧係好難，只係依靠自己獨立發布嘅作品咧，係去謀生或者係去淘利，所以導致咗咧佢哋嘅地位咧係不對等。

232
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:27,430
而喺用家嘅角度，亦都只有版權商同埋網絡中介平台先至有資源能夠聘請龐大嘅法律團隊，係去寫非常複雜嘅私人合約條文，去規限網民獲得嘅豁免。但係市民係唔清楚，我哋喺市面買呢啲版權作品，又或者係交版權。

233
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:33,500
費用究竟係有幾多收益？係最終落到去原創者嘅手上邊？

234
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:42,360
主席，你一定會知道香港有一位資深嘅演員曾江咧，佢有一個我哋睇咗幾廿年嘅染髮劑嘅廣告。

235
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:51,260
播足喺電視上邊咧，足足四十年啊！因為廣廣告商一早就買斷咗呢個播放權，仲喺合約上邊。

236
01:03:51,560 --> 01:04:03,510
喺合約上邊寫咗係無播放期限，廣告商當年係特意要求呢一位資深演員曾江咧，喺一啲特技欄目背景係拍攝。

237
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:23,950
令到日後廣告商咧係可以隨時隨地咧係去改呢個廣告，將佢改頭換面咧，又作又當係一個新廣告咧，係播出街。而結果呢一位嘅資深演員咧咁多年，連一毫子分紅都冇辦法收得翻。我哋同事馬逢國議員主席係冇正視到呢一位。

238
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:41,380
呢一種啊，係對演員嘅剝削。今次版權修訂條例，如果係唔加入限制合約零價條文，最終得益嘅咧，唔係我哋而家講喺呢個商業世界食物鏈底層嘅創作人、歌手、演員。

239
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,360
而係版權商大財團。

240
01:04:45,500 --> 01:05:05,510
主席面對版權商大財團，無論係創作人，抑或係一般嘅市民，我哋嘅議價能力係好低，係好有限。消費者委員會喺二零一二年四月曾經發表咗一份名為《公平條款，互利共贏》嘅報告書，針對香港市面上邊講。

241
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:20,380
廣泛使用嘅標準格式合約，羅列咗電信、銀行、美容業一啲唔公平條款嘅情況，而呢一啲唔公平條款嘅嘅情況咧，係源於供應商係有較為高嘅議價能力。

242
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:41,090
同埋掌握咗資訊，令對令到佢哋咧可以佔盡優勢，而唔需要考慮到消費者嘅利益。報告裏邊仲有好多唔公平條款嘅例子，而同時版權商又或者係網絡中介人所定嘅私人合約咧，其實係同消費者委員會。

243
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:50,050
報告裏邊講嘅情況咧，係非常之類似。所謂標準格式消費合約，都係由供應商預先係去制定。

244
01:05:50,330 --> 01:06:10,340
當中條款係冇同個別消費者喺磋商。消費者委員會嘅報告嘅導言部分係噉樣去形容，就係話係基於要又或者唔要嘅形式係去提出嘅。我哋作為消費者根本就冇能力同個別供應商討價還價。

245
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:22,240
即使我哋作為消費者或者香港市民作為消費者知道合約條款對佢哋不利，但係佢哋關心主要就係貨品同埋服務嘅價錢質素。

246
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:35,420
一般嘅情況之下咧，消費者最終都係會簽約，一心咧就只係或者係一雙情願咧，係希望供應商唔好引用呢啲對佢哋不利嘅條款。

247
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:52,730
而家好多版權商又或者係網絡供應商提供嘅使用條款咧，其實就係好似報告裏邊咁講，係用要又或者唔要嘅形式咧，係去提出個別用家係好難同Facebook、YouTube呢啲大公司咧係去討價還價。

248
01:06:53,280 --> 01:07:04,310
主席，消委會裏邊嘅報告仲有一啲事例咧，就係話供應商可以單方面修改合約，係唔需要你合約嘅理，唔需要合理嘅理由。

249
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:26,460
消費者委員會認為呢啲條款係畀供應商隨意更改條款嘅權力，而可能導致唔公平嘅情況。即使就算合約嘅修改係令到消費者實質上邊喪失佢原本購買嘅嘅物品、商品、服務嘅話咧，消費者都係。

250
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,990
係要遵守合約。

251
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:40,510
個報告裏邊咧係用咗個電信業嘅實際例子，就係話有收費嘅電視台嘅合約噉樣寫嘅，該電視台有權隨時增加、取消、更改。

252
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:59,130
或以其他內容代替已公佈嘅節目及內容，亦都係有權因應其認為合適嘅情況之下，隨時增加、更改或者減少任何頻道嘅數量、結構組合或任何內容，而無需預先通知客户。

253
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,430
亦都係有一間提供婚宴服務嘅公司。

254
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:10,510
主席，佢嘅合約係噉樣寫嘅，本公司可以隨時及不時不時修改。

255
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:31,970
本條款嘅任何增補，經本公司認為合適嘅方式咧，係向客户作出合理嘅通知之後咧，即開始生效。若客户於修訂生效日又或者以後繼續保留或使用此服務，此等修訂即對客户有約束力。

256
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:43,660
主席消委會認為呢啲條款咧，就係會導致到納約雙方嘅地位不平等，因為供應商有單方面嘅權力咧，係去迫使。

257
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:49,560
小市民迫使消費者係接受即將修改嘅合約條款。

258
01:08:49,910 --> 01:09:09,920
正如我第一次發言裏邊提到嘅Candy Crush，第二次發言裏邊提到我哋立法會網頁嘅例子，又或者有好多其他在席議員提嘅例子咧，其實都係講明咗版權商同網絡中介人嘅私人合約係有出現到上述我頭先講嘅納約雙方。

259
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:22,180
方地位不平等嘅問題，用家係必須同意當中非常極之冗長嘅條款同埋細節之後咧，先至可以開始使用佢嘅服務又或者程式嘅。

260
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:37,550
所以今次版權修訂條例通過之後咧，版權商又或者係網絡中介商咧，亦都係可以隨住單方面修改合約，去加入凌駕版權條條例嘅條款。

261
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,840
網民、市民只係能夠被逼接受。

262
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,290
主席。

263
01:09:45,360 --> 01:10:05,370
最我想講嘅咧，就係消委會報告裏邊咧，亦都係有另外一啲不平等條款嘅例子。我認為更加係適用於版權修訂條例，我哋而家討論嘅呢一節裏邊嘅呢個例子就係合約不合理地限制消費者嘅法律權益，其中竟然有一間瘦身簽。

264
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,410
睇公司喺合約裏邊列明。

265
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:27,700
於甲方即係供應者根據合約中條例而終止合約後，乙方即係消費者不能向任何人士，包括傳媒、網上討論區等提及甲方其服務內容或商業事務，否則甲方有權提出法律起訴。

266
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:48,420
主席，消費者委員會認為呢啲限制嘅範圍咧係非常或者係過於廣泛，亦都係會剝，亦都係會剝奪咗消費者嘅言論同埋表達意見嘅自由，同埋佢哋尋求糾正嘅權利。呢條款已經係遠遠超出保護雙語正當權益，又或者係保。

267
01:10:48,420 --> 01:11:04,350
保守商業秘密嘅所有權益嘅報告，對呢項唔公平嘅條款嘅建議咧，只係用咗非常簡單嘅一句講，就話such term should be deleted，即係話呢類嘅條款應該係喺消費合約之中咧，係去刪除。

268
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:24,960
所以主席，消費者委員會嘅報告建議政府喺設立全面消費全面性嘅消費者保養嘅法例嘅同時咧，係對標準格式消費合約裏邊一啲唔公平條款，唔應該係唔應該置之不理。而報告嘅附件亦都係就美容業界嘅情況咧，係列出咗。

269
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:32,070
點樣係去公平草擬標準格式嘅指引嘅？咁所以援引呢啲噉樣嘅示例，畀我哋瞭解到咧。

270
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:46,010
喺我哋而家版權限制，版權商喺合約裏邊加入凌駕性版權條例嘅不平條款咧，當然就係平衡雙方納約權利，係屬於重大嘅公眾利益。主席。

271
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,800
梁國雄議員。

272
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:54,790
啊，主席。

273
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,010
我認為呢度係唔夠人。

274
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,390
兩個月。

275
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:04,440
嗱，主席，咁喺大家慢慢行翻嚟嘅過程裏邊，我都send咗一個有關呢個梵高嘅動畫畀你嘅。

276
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,110
應聲反告。

277
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:08,030
咁好多人贊。

278
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,420
嗱，我點解會send send畀你咧？

279
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,040
其實咁聲我都唔知有冇事嘅。

280
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:23,030
啊！有八百幾、八百三十五萬人咧，係即係分享咗嗰個喺Facebook嗰個分享咗，咁非常之好睇。我希望一間嚟睇下啦，咁悶而家。

281
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,940
嗱。

282
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:37,390
其實講嚟講去，我上次講嘅時候用呢個亞片戰爭呢個例嚟講，即係嗰個嗰個講法啦。其實一個一一房都已經幾個禮拜啦。

283
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:40,010
嗱，其實我哋講緊乜嘢呢？

284
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,880
我又諗到一句説話。

285
01:25:47,960 --> 01:26:03,040
若要取之，必欲與之，即係話你畀咗嘢人先攞得翻㗎嘛？當然呢一個道理嘅講法就係哲學㗎，即係話你畀啲嘢人哋，氹人哋畀翻啲嘢你，喂呢度就係噉啊嘛！佢唔畀你點攞翻啫？

286
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,290
無啦啦，山達拉。

287
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:07,660
係咪啊？講緊話。

288
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:24,510
即係講個天下無敵噉就話哦嗱，你而家我哋要保全保保障呢個版權人嘅條例，咁既然間你班友喺度嘈嘈閉，噉我畀六大樣嘢畀你誒去作為一個即係辯解嘅理由啦。其實即係唔係豁免啊，各位。

289
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,740
因為告唔告係告咗你先㗎。

290
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:31,540
係咪？唔係豁免啊！唔好意思啊！

291
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,630
係你作為個辯解嘅理由。

292
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:45,290
去到法庭嗰度就話哦，其實咧我就誒第一件盔甲我著到嘅，第二件盔甲我著到嘅，咁所以咧誒對方嚟拮我咧係唔啱嘅。

293
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:53,500
唔好畀佢揾刀嚟刼我啦！噉樣即係即係噉嘅，其實就係嗱，呢個係安心啊嘛，即係即係呢個好似保嬰丹噉樣。

294
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:55,920
安心，寧神。

295
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,290
好啦，噉佢出嚟就拗。

296
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:05,680
就話咁都唔得嘅喎，咁如果第七件即係第七樣點咧？第七宗罪得唔得啊？

297
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:13,970
嗱，我哋依家都唔拗啦。唉，就算你嗰六樣啦，因為數之不盡啊嘛，喺咁喺度舉一個，一路噉樣演繹嘅話。

298
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:15,840
好啦。

299
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:19,850
而家而家個講法係咩？就係話得。

300
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:24,880
你有六樣嘢可以打打官司嗰陣時，作為一個合理辯解。

301
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,430
不過有一樣嘢，就係呢個主席呢個叫做法律的彈書。

302
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:36,280
啊！你如果唔死有一百歲嘅，即係嗰啲噉嘅嘢啦，啲冇意義嘅嘢嚟嘅啊！

303
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:43,120
O.K.你做乜都得，但係如果有呢樣嘢出現咧，噉就冇啦，唔得啦。

304
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,370
主席。

305
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:51,110
我睇睇呢一個條例草案嘅主要目的。

306
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,950
啊，裏邊咧就。

307
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,760
係喺個港股附錄嗰度咧。

308
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,210
就有。

309
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,310
就下啲詩意，定定條文。

310
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,230
咁咧就A、B、C、D、E，A至到D啦。

311
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:17,260
都唔關事嘅，所以其實我哋今日講緊呢一個噉嘅所謂。

312
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:29,240
誒六大辯解理由畀咗你之後，再話咧有呢一個合約零價豁免咧，係喺依個相關字嗰度嘅。

313
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:39,990
如果你唔信，你自己睇睇。你成日教我睇下嗰啲，睇完先講。你由由A讀到D，有邊樣話？唉，鑑於科技一日千里。

314
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:52,540
呢一個大量人使用呢一個互聯網作為傳播自己信息或者係表達嘅嘢，我哋要保障佢哋嘅權利。冇寫過嘅喎，其實。

315
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,720
個意思就係咩咧？就係話，當我哋喺度。

316
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:05,290
自稱就係話要與時並進去保障版權人嘅時候咧，我哋順帶喺依嘅相關事嗰度咧。

317
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:08,200
就做翻一個對稱嘅保護。

318
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:20,470
其實係噉樣樣，係咪？你讀你讀落去真係讀唔到嘅，讀唔到有今日。我哋講我哋啲主要嘅嘅議員講就係話要維護呢一個誒。

319
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:25,660
網民即係誒使用即係個使用者嘅權利咧，其實只不過相關事宜嗰度。

320
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:29,300
噉啊，當然啦，主席一個議會。

321
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:35,280
講法律，法律係咩嚟㗎？法律就係叫我哋呢班六十九個人。

322
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:41,550
有好多人喺出邊講就木嘴嚟去依據民意立法啊嘛！

323
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:43,590
所以啱嘅喎。

324
01:29:43,870 --> 01:30:01,520
主席，今日咁大嘅爭論，馬逢國議員就係功能團體議員，佢而家一定要為功能團體裏邊嘅人去做嘢㗎嘛？坐喺對面，咦？蘇錦良做咩啊？走咗出去食糖水啊？梁國雄議員，請你講翻呢個合約靈駕性是否要限制嘅問題。

325
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:03,630
咁而家咪講緊咯。

326
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,900
我講緊就係話。

327
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,640
我代表嘅利益，我就係認為。

328
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:15,040
我好似當年呢個中國中華人民共和國噉樣，就係話唔好意思。

329
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:22,860
一九七一年，你嗰個咩咩咩咩南京條約係冇效嘅，我而家就代表呢樣嘢啊嘛！

330
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:29,760
嗱，咁所以其實今次嘅立法過程裏邊咧，我哋就唔滿意。

331
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:45,330
嗰個嗰個所謂六項嘅合理嘅辯解理由咧，係會有另一樣嘢前門前門拒虎，後門進狼啊嘛！前面有隻老虎就係話：喂，你咬我！

332
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:55,460
噉我咪頂住佢。你話喂，你得啊，你可以豁面啊，唔係唔係唔係豁面，可以合你面㗎。後面走只狼出嚟話：，喂，唔好意思，只老虎咬你唔死啫，我喺後邊咬你啊！

333
01:30:56,110 --> 01:31:01,730
係咪我前面頂住你後邊嚟？咁所以話嗰個合約零價。

334
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,850
零界而家我哋嘅豁免呢個噉嘅做法咧，係絕對不可取㗎嘛！

335
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,580
係咪啊？

336
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:14,580
噉我又又睇到呢一個，阿譚耀宗又喺邊度就啊喺度。

337
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:26,970
就嗱引呢個大律師公會嗰位主席講：，哎呀，你哋網民識唔識嘢㗎？如果一一一旦噉樣做嘅時候，我想畀多啲嘢你都唔得㗎。多謝啦。

338
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:30,740
你唔使畀多啲嘢我啊！你唔好攞咗我嘢先啊！

339
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,730
係咪噉嘅意見都講得出嚟咧？我嗱，嗰位嗰位嗰位大律師，我唔知啊，唔知唔知佢講緊乜嘢嘅真係。

340
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:45,130
係咪？我哋一路嘅概念就係話，譬如而家舉勞工誒呢個勞工條例，就係話，喂，如果衰過。

341
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:55,340
立法會訂立嘅法例嘅嘢，如果你揾個合約，就算揼揼曬手印腳印，趴埋成個人落去吸引都唔制，都唔算啊嘛！

342
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:59,720
係咪？但係好過我哋冇講過嘅喎。

343
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,050
嗱，所以喺呢個喺呢個問題上面。

344
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,020
我哋今日爭論嘅就係咩咧？

345
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,340
就係話，我哋要保障。

346
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,750
政府聲稱。

347
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,170
畀嘅六項。

348
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:19,590
喺法庭上面嘅辯解因素啊嘛，嗱喺呢一個。

349
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:32,200
雲雲議員裏邊即係贊成政府嘅嘅講法，即係話誒無需即係無需修訂啦，你係咪嘥嘥時間啊？佢又真係冇講到一旦如果。

350
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:37,150
有個一個合約零價嘅時候，佢點樣去保障普通人？

351
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:39,230
被人哋殺掉喎！

352
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:43,130
即係保障唔到只狼喺後邊嚟咬我屁股喎！

353
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:46,000
咁呢個辯論好清楚㗎嘛，主席。

354
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:49,920
係咪啊？嗱，所以喺呢個喺呢個問題上面。

355
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,290
我嘅我嘅睇法就係得兩樣嘢啫，主席。

356
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:56,690
根據你咁精密嘅呢個。

357
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:07,220
啊！頭腦就係一一係咧，就係不停咁演繹嗰啲誒誒誒誒誒誒誒合理辯解，直到天荒地老。

358
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:13,350
即係即係，個世界有二二萬三百種咧，你都整咗出嚟。

359
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:28,300
都冇用啊！最慘就係你明唔明啊？就哦，你有二萬三百個二萬二萬三百個誒呢個誒想法庭嘅合理辯解，免免於被免於被呢個判罪成。

360
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:39,950
佢喺後邊攞走你啦嘛，咁攞張合約出嚟，佢話啊唔好意思，阿梁生，你張合約係講咗冇用喎呢樣嘢，咁都得？

361
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,880
一個憲法性嘅權利係可以由。

362
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:56,770
合約嚟取消，噉我喂老實講，主席，噉你就唔好做主席啦，係咪啊？我哋呢度咁莊嚴嘅，原來係揾咗合約撕傷受受就得，喂，撕傷受受都唔緊要啊，主席。

363
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:05,650
而家兵臨城下啊嘛！主席有一日，如果我嗰次我同你去波蘭噉樣，有一晚。

364
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:14,740
我揸住個酒，我飲完啲伏特卡，揸住個酒樽打爛咗，跟住揈下揈下。阿玉勝興啊，你飲唔飲啫？你梗係話飲啦，個。

365
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:25,360
你個波，你個隊，你啊嘛。嗱，呢個，你講嘅同誒，你你嗱，你你你唔使發嬲，其實仲衰過攞個玻璃樽啊，就係話。

366
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:30,560
我哋作為一個最基層嘅消費者，我哋而家網絡嘅服務。

367
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:34,200
已經係必備嘅啦，好似空氣同水噉樣。

368
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:43,630
噉你同我講就係話，喂，你要唔要嗰啲服務先？即係等於收買啦，即係即係呢個剪鏡察，你過唔過條路啊？

369
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:47,080
你聽唔明啊？係你真係聽唔明，你真係渣。

370
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,020
法定人數。

371
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,950
呢個事實上係喎。

372
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,360
個錢政策嚟㗎嘛！

373
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:02,250
阿梁宇，請你請你暫時停止發言，依家。

374
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,800
請你坐低，暫時停止發言。

375
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:27,590
啲嘢嘥時。

376
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:36,310
梁國雄議員，請你繼續發言。請你唔好離題。我哋現在嘅辯論嘅題目咧，係是否要限制？

377
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,910
合約。

378
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:46,310
對於版權闊免嘅凌駕性，知道嗱，噉我正話講到咧。

379
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:53,410
所以好似個剪鏡察噉樣就誒，你如果你唔應承佢，又唔畀佢過噉樣樣。咁其實一樣嘅啫噃。

380
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,930
嗰啲嗰啲誒版嗰啲誒版權人同埋嗰啲誒中介商咧。

381
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:07,120
佢係行住條路噉啊！你要經過條路啊嘛。如果嗰條路唔係重要嘅，唔緊要。譬如講，你諗住去醫院啦。

382
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:15,440
就嚟死啦！噉佢剪剪剪勁剪咗嘅時候，佢會殺殺死你㗎嘛？係咪先？咁喺呢個角度嚟講，

383
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,480
喺一個角度嚟講。

384
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,430
呢啲人係唔應該咁做㗎嘛？

385
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:22,130
佢要你籤一個合約。

386
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,290
希望。

387
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:29,470
你以後都要叫我老做做做做老豆，我冇理由噉樣㗎嘛，係咪？

388
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:36,020
嗱，所以不能夠成人之危，尤其是當我哋我政委強調咗。

389
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:51,520
上網發表嘢或者收到網上嘅信息，呢種即係互動嘅關係咧，其實係人類文明到而家為止咧，等於係生等於呢個水同埋氧氣。任何人去揸住啲嘢嚟同人講價都唔啱嘅。

390
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:57,050
嗱，今日我哋講緊嘅係咩咧？就係如果用第二個講法，就係話。

391
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,420
即係我用舉例啊！

392
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,680
咁有個人同我講就係話，我我可以。

393
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:05,440
叫一隻。

394
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:06,990
好。

395
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:10,520
肚餓嘅老虎唔咬你。

396
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:12,980
但係。

397
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,980
可以保證。

398
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:25,610
但係，如果你冇問到只老虎，肚唔肚餓咗，老虎唔應承你嘅時候咧，佢食咗你，我幫你唔到啦。呢一個。

399
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:29,720
所謂合約零價，我哋。

400
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,410
喺立法會嘅。

401
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:37,700
通過咗個條例裏邊嘅六大呢一個合理辯解嘅。

402
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:43,340
嘅嘅權利或者係呢一個理由咧，其實就係真係等於噉樣樣。

403
01:49:43,730 --> 01:49:44,490
喂。

404
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,970
你同你叫我與虎謀皮？

405
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:55,060
啊！我叫佢唔咬你，我叫佢唔咬你都都得㗎。佢好肚餓，我要控制呢只老虎㗎。

406
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:59,380
我得得，只要你你應承我得啦。

407
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:05,320
係咪？佢係想咬你嘅，但係我既然應承咗你，佢就唔會咬你。

408
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:10,110
不過，但係，如果你冇同佢立到約。

409
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,230
噉我幫你唔到㗎啦，我同老夫有約。

410
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:23,260
你又同老虎冇約，咁點幫你咧？其實成個問題，嗰個前前即前狼拒虎，後門進狼，個意思就係噉樣樣，主席。

411
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:27,800
當我哋根據民意。

412
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,450
去。

413
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,850
制定。

414
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:45,290
喺個立法機關裏邊，根據民意代表去制定咗個法例，章章明顯係講明要保障使用者嘅權利，而政府又整咗一個。

415
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:49,000
合約零加成畀外碳嘅時候。

416
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,360
噉我哋有乜有乜有乜意思喺度討論？

417
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,100
係咪？

418
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:59,100
你一百你一百歲唔死，我畀我畀個官你做嗰只嘢咯。你要做咗一百歲唔死先得㗎。

419
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,740
係咪有幾多人一百歲唔死啊？

420
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:07,960
或者我再粗鄙啲咁講，你好似彭祖咁長命，我一定畀個官你做，有乜意思啊？

421
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:11,500
所以喺呢個問題上面，我都諗唔明其他人。

422
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:16,720
喺度拗乜嘢？我個我個角度好簡單，我個角度非常之簡單。

423
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:22,880
就係合約一個不對等嘅合約，一個。

424
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:31,090
若方不能不照守嘅合約，本身已經係不道德。根據資本主義嘅合約精神，已經不道德。

425
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:35,370
而我哋嘅立法會嘅議員同埋，

426
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:41,330
政府或者誒呢一個版權人或中介商嘅代表。

427
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:46,940
連呢一點都守唔住，佢保佢冇辦法保證到我哋一張好嘅合約喎。

428
01:51:47,590 --> 01:52:06,810
噉佢仲要喺而家嚟講就係話：哦，唔好意思啊，你哋自己與虎謀皮咯，謀唔到皮關我咩事啫？我唔你唔能夠與虎謀皮，你唔能夠令到一隻好餓嘅老虎唔肚餓，我真係幫你唔到嘅。我淨係叫只餓嘅老虎唔好食你啫。至於，

429
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:15,070
佢聽唔聽我講，我又唔知；佢聽唔聽你講，我又唔知。主席，呢啲噉嘅嘢邊度得㗎？所以。

430
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:35,740
我嘅講法就係講咗無謂，我堅決站喺呢一個無權無勢、冇辦法根據，即使係根據資本主義嘅原則去定一個雙方勢力均等嘅合約嘅網民發言，呢啲噉嘅合約係揾笨嘅。如果靠呢啲合

431
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:43,600
合約去攞走翻嗰六大嘅辯解理由，呢個根本就係一個騙案，係一個騙局。

432
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:51,880
小弟係最憎騙子嘅，所以小弟發言係支持嗰個修訂。多謝主席。

433
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:54,150
有Q U。

434
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:55,510
主席。

435
01:52:56,610 --> 01:53:00,680
張家語言，係請你點算法定人數？

436
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:28,120
用我嘅語言。

437
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:30,510
多謝主席。

438
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:35,080
非常榮幸咧，喺昨日首次係。

439
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:39,740
誒作出我演辭之後咧，係能夠獲得咧。

440
02:06:40,030 --> 02:07:00,040
數位建制派重量級嘅前輩咧，係點名回應小弟嘅言論，咁亦都當中咧係圍繞住，因為本人咧係參與佢哋口中嘅拉布，我覺得咧我有責任咧係喺度咧係簡單噉樣回應一下幾位建制派重。

441
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,000
重量級前輩嘅言論㗎。

442
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:05,050
或者可能咧，呢啲前輩忘記咗。

443
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:23,030
我係背負住超過十六萬選民咧嘅授權，係進入議會進行我嘅工作。不過當然，我亦都係心存謙卑，知道咧我入到嚟都係因為僥倖，亦都係因為得到民建聯嘅承讓，先至可以係企喺呢度嘅啫。

444
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:26,050
主席，建制派。

445
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:46,340
幾位嘅重量級議員，亦都咧喺今次今次嘅辯論裏邊咧，係令我大開眼界，亦都係深存感動。感動在於邊度咧？係在於我見到佢哋對於大律師公會嘅言論同埋意見咧，係奉為有如聖經一般嘅神聖。

446
02:07:46,370 --> 02:08:04,580
呢個令我係帶有一點驚訝嘅激動嘅，主席，我哋必須要記得，縱觀過去咁多年大律師公會就香港嘅議題發表意見嘅時候，嗰啲意見書落到喺建制派議員手中，都係並不重視。

447
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:24,870
但係今次竟然如獲至寶，呢一種嘅轉變，我相信係有效能夠打開大家對於法治概念嘅一個良好一步。我亦都祝願建制派議員以後亦都要多多理解大律師公會往後對於香港不同政治議題嘅立場，呢個。

448
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:27,840
必然係能夠促進香港嘅法治。

449
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:49,340
至於剛才梁美芬議員針對本人話，我尋日唔單止咧，我提提及嘅，我哋今日處理嘅唔單止係法律問題，而且仲要係政治問題。梁議員亦都提到香港咁多問題，民生又畀佢哋政治化，法律問題又畀佢哋政治。

450
02:08:49,340 --> 02:09:09,350
事化，但係而家討論嘅版權條例應該回歸法律問題。主席請容許我提醒我嘅同行兼前輩梁議員，我哋能夠身處呢個尊貴嘅議事堂，我哋並非只係喺利用我哋嘅法律知識去貢獻市民。我相信梁議員同樣作為一位民選。

451
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:21,300
選議員，佢亦都必然係要為香港人嘅利益去作出捍衞，而我哋亦都唔能夠只係純粹站在版權持有人嘅利益咧去睇事情嘅。

452
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:36,460
至於剛才今朝較早時間，謝偉俊議員提及有啲創作人不思進取、食老本，認為佢哋已經係上位，根本係無需要積極創作，先至唔介意畀人抄襲噉話。

453
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:56,900
我認為咧，主席謝議員可能就忘記咗咧。其實香港有好多嘅創作人係非常之咁有良道，而且呢啲嘅創作人亦都心明知道創作係需要空間，而且香港有咁豐沛嘅二次創作，呢啲亦都係互相鼓勵創意。

454
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,050
較早前咧。

455
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:07,260
尊貴嘅石禮謙議員亦都咧係作出一個非常精彩嘅陳詞，噉啊容許我咧係以廣東話作出回應。

456
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:23,460
當中咧，石議員提及嘅一點就係點解喺面對住言論自由同埋呢一個誒合約自由上邊，我哋唔交翻畀法庭去處理，而要由我哋就今次呢一個。

457
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:43,980
合約零價條款咧，係要加落去，要特登咧去破壞呢個合約自由，係嘛？或者石議員亦都請容許我喺度簡單嘅回應咧，就係其實今次合約零加升條款嘅精神咧，其實係互相係補足到呢一個合合約自由嘅一啲不足。

458
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:47,390
嘅呢個就係我以下會慢慢回應嘅。

459
02:10:48,050 --> 02:11:08,060
主席，我哋非常清楚，合約自由咧係成個文明社會嘅基石之一，亦都係一個資本主義社會裏邊必須要有嘅。但係有一點，我相信在座每一位都必然同意咧，就係當合約自由係能夠無限擴張。

460
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:28,070
而呢個無限擴張，甚至觸及到影響到一個使用者或者合約嘅另一方佢本人嘅權利嘅時候，呢一個我所指嘅係，甚至有可能影響到埋佢喺法律上邊嘅權利，而招致有可能喺民事上邊失去佢嘅基本罕惠權利嘅時候。

461
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:33,260
咁呢個就並非我哋立法者應該捍衞嘅合約自由啦。

462
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:34,720
主席。

463
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:55,010
其實今次contract override成個精神根本一啲都唔複雜，我哋只係希望係為法律提供一個確定性。我哋亦都只係希望係容許我哋合約嘅用家，正如剛才弊黨黨友郭榮亨議員亦都指出嘅，就係。

464
02:11:55,010 --> 02:12:15,020
當我哋作為一個無權無勢嘅消費者，喺網上又或者喺現實世界都好，我哋使用購買商品也好，我哋係利用一啲網上嘅平台都好，我哋往往都係必須要同意咗某一啲已經既定設定咗嘅條款，而呢啲條款對於大部分嘅香港人也好。

465
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:24,580
或者其實任何嘅正常人都好，未必有足夠嘅智慧去閲讀、理解，甚至其實主席根本係無權拒絕。

466
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:45,150
一個好簡單嘅例子就係例如，如果要用Facebook嘅話，一定係要同意佢某一啲嘅條款嘅。如果我哋拒絕使用嘅話，根本就無權選擇。有冇限侷限地使用Facebook咧？冇。有冇得侷限地使用YouTube咧？冇。正正係因為噉嘅原因，面對住大牀。

467
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:56,990
面對住呢啲嘅平台，呢啲潛在有可能係剝奪一啲用家佢嘅網上使用權利嘅，根本普通人係冇得選擇。

468
02:12:57,270 --> 02:13:02,520
呢個就係個大背景啦！正正因為呢個原因，點解我哋希望喺今次？

469
02:13:02,890 --> 02:13:22,900
呢個修訂嗰度係能夠加入合約零價條款咧，就係可以增加個確定性。確定乜嘢啊？就係確定現時我哋法例希望保障到市民嘅自由嘅時候，並唔會因為呢啲大商家、大財團所製作呢啲複雜嘅合約而被剝奪。

470
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:28,070
就係一個咁簡單嘅邏輯同埋道理，但係好可惜，主席。

471
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:48,690
經歷咗咁漫長嘅辯論，似乎我哋咁多位民主派議員嘅一啲熱情，或者係循循善有嘅呢啲説法咧，都未必能夠打動到我哋嘅政府官員，又或者在座其他嘅同事。請容許我提醒佢哋，其實我哋咁多位坐喺度，就算各位你。

472
02:13:48,690 --> 02:14:08,700
亦係屬於功能組別都好，我哋背後都係由香港人選擇我哋進入呢個議會。而香港人最大嘅多數，我相信未必係版權持有人。我哋係需要捍衞嘅係一般大眾嘅權利，但係好可惜，我哋今次見到嘅係政府一而再。

473
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:28,710
再二三咁以版權持有人嘅立場嚟抵擋住我哋嘅要求，但係主席，我哋睇到嘅係我哋呢啲嘅要求係咪真係好過分咧？其實唔係啫，我哋只不過係希望令到法律有一個穩定性喺度，而其實我哋作為以立法者，我哋企喺度嘅功能。

474
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:34,450
我哋嘅工作就係確保法律係清晰可見，而且係可預見嘅。

475
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:54,760
但係點解版權持有人唔肯噉樣做咧？好明顯，呢個牽涉到嘅係利益，而呢個利益當然唔係大眾嘅利益，而係佢哋自己本身嘅利益。既然係噉嘅時候，究竟我哋嘅特區政府係咪真係繼續代表住我哋嘅香港人咧？呢一點我係值得商榷嘅。

476
02:14:54,830 --> 02:15:14,840
正如今日，第黨嘅黨友郭榮亨議員亦都係引述前大律師公會主席李誌喜女士嘅一封公開信，當中亦都係非常清楚咁指出，我哋希望尋求嘅呢幾個修訂案，都係希望得到市民有一個穩定嘅一個前情況底下可以去使用佢哋嘅網上。

477
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:26,420
世界，但係主席，我哋睇唔到政府有任何嘅回應，亦都睇唔到政府有任何嘅誠意，希望可以為我哋帶來一個更加美好嘅一個網上世界。

478
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:44,930
主席，我記得咧喺我哋今次嘅討論過程當中，係出現過咧喺啱啱嘅時間，係出現過有一個所謂嘅四方會談，即係話由網民咧、政府官員、我哋民主派議員同埋版權持有人咧，係一齊組成一個會議。

479
02:15:45,210 --> 02:16:05,220
其實呢一個係我哋希望做到，亦都係我相信係一個正面而有健康嘅一個第一步嚟嘅。其實喺面對住法律爭拗嘅過程裏邊，我哋能夠做到一個噉嘅平台，儘管最後嘅結果未盡人意，但係其實呢一個亦都係我哋希望能夠打開嘅第一步。但係我哋見唔？

480
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:15,640
到有任何嘅政府官員係願意就呢一樣嘢建基於呢個努力咧，係再作進一步嘅努力，呢一個係令人非常可惜，主席。

481
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:19,230
講到尾。

482
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:28,120
其實我哋今次呢個爭議並非係口舌之爭，亦都更加唔係義氣之爭。

483
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:42,880
我哋今次所做嘅，其實係希望為香港定立一個長遠、廣闊而又健康嘅網上世界。但係好可惜，我哋見唔到政府官員有同樣嘅魄力同埋決心去為大家噉樣做。

484
02:16:43,160 --> 02:17:03,170
早期我哋聽到嘅係政府認為我哋應該先待住先，就係將現時嘅版權條例修訂草案先接受，然後喺未來嘅日子尋找空間作出修訂。但係主席，我必須要提醒政府官員，其實政府官員亦都必然比我更清楚，就係喺現時嘅環

485
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:23,180
環境底下要再進行一個檢討，又或者誒未來將來再修訂現時嘅呢一個版權條例修訂草案，相信係非常困難。困難並非係因為而家嘅香港嘅政治環境係非常之咁矛充滿矛盾，而係我哋而家做緊嘅一啲法律嘅工作，我哋都知道係。

486
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:43,190
非常嚴謹嘅，亦都冇可能經歷咗一個漫長嘅時間通過嘅法律，可以喺過兩年無端端又會再擺上翻枱面，再去做一個檢討同修訂呢個係絕對浪費納税人嘅時間同埋金錢。既然如此，我亦都係懇請政府官員係能夠考慮接納我哋今次呢一個。

487
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:52,380
修訂，亦都希望佢哋理解到郭榮亨議員所提出嘅呢個修訂，其實最終只不過係希望為法律帶來一個確定性同埋穩定性。

488
02:17:53,200 --> 02:18:00,940
主席，我唔係好確定，我有冇再，我仲有冇機會就本議題咧，係作進一步嘅發言，我只係希望咧。

489
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:12,930
今次係能夠放下我哋立法會嘅記錄，等議員、等官員知道，其實我哋只不過係希望能夠為香港帶來一個更加美好嘅網上世界。

490
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:14,560
以上係我陳詞。

491
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:17,840
陳志全議員。

492
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:19,680
多謝主席。

493
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:23,850
我手上呢本《二零一四版權修訂條例》啦。

494
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:28,010
我揭咗都接近兩年嘅時間。

495
02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:42,120
其實今日咧，去到而家咧，係喺全體委員會階段，仲係第一場嘅合拼辯論，針對限制合約零價嘅條文。

496
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:45,590
喺今次嘅。

497
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:58,390
委員會階段咧，我自己咧都係提出咗一個修正案，就係公平使用嘅修正。但我估計咧喺今次嘅會議裏邊咧，亦都冇機會咧可以討論得到。

498
02:18:58,670 --> 02:18:59,710
主席。

499
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:10,670
我哋總共咧係有一百一十九條修正案，五場嘅合拼辯論，而家咧只係第一場限制合約凌駕性，只係去到一半。

500
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:14,880
蘇錦梁局長上個星期四公開話。

501
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:26,020
如果今個禮拜呢三日會議唔能夠完成三讀版權修正條例咧，佢就會作罷。

502
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:31,720
而家倒數，剩翻唔夠七個鐘頭。

503
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:52,570
但係咧，就因為可能阿蘇局長講咗呢句説話，令到咧建制派議員咧勇於發言。嗱喺限制合約凌駕性條文，我淨係計呢兩日嘅會議發言嘅人次咧，係超過三十人，其中咧有九位係建制派嘅同事。

504
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:54,140
即係話咧。

505
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:57,530
即使係第一場辯論。

506
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:00,850
大家都覺得仲有好多嘢可以講。

507
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:06,180
大家知道五場合拼辯論嘅戲玉係第二場。

508
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:09,380
公平使用同埋。

509
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:13,170
個人用户衍生內容都未開始。

510
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:18,730
局長，你唔好呃我，當你唔係呃人，你唔好呃自己。

511
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:25,070
餘下七個鐘頭，點樣能夠完成呢一條？

512
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:30,080
二零一四版權修訂條例嘅三讀咧。

513
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:35,210
你問下頭先發言嗰九個建制派議員，佢哋係咪拉布？

514
02:20:35,630 --> 02:20:39,090
佢哋係咪阻住你去通過呢條法例？

515
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:41,470
係咪冇實質嘅進展？

516
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:54,800
當然唔係啦，正正因為局長畫咗條死線，議員更加勇於發言，我哋嘅辯論更加有火花，更加精彩啊！只係講限制合約零價呢度。

517
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:58,660
我舉例，頭先有議員係話。

518
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:00,430
有啲創作人。

519
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:07,130
佢話唔介意自己的作品畀人二次創作，包括啊林夕先生、黃偉文先生啦。

520
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:22,300
話佢哋不思進取，食老本上咗岸，即係可能叫唔志在錢啦，所以就唔介意人哋抄。噉啊，黃偉文先生咧已經回應咗，好簡短嘅啫。我覺得咧應該喺呢度交代翻。

521
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:34,820
Y文咧用咗徐小鳳嘅《大亨》呢首歌裏邊嘅chorus，即係個副歌嘅兩句，都係二次創作嚟到回應剛才嗰位議員嘅批評嘅，我唱出嚟。

522
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:40,130
邏輯呢？邏輯呢？

523
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:58,310
我引述食老本便不介意被抄襲嘅言論，聽得我好頭暈。呢個係黃偉文先生講，失去創作能力，打算抱着幾款舊model食老本過世的人，才應該更介意被抄襲。

524
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:06,630
因為佢哋嘅貨就係得咁多，已成定局，被抄一款少一款，masterpiece。

525
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:26,920
只有創作力源源不絕嘅人，先至唔怕大方宴客。你即管抄啦，你今日抄一款，我聽日出多九款。最應該講邏輯嘅職業，竟然係最零邏輯、最反智，亦都真係醜死鬼嚇死人。嗱，跟住。

526
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:37,590
嗰兩句就比較針對性，叫佢自己睇啦。我唔想嘥時間講。不過歪文話咧，仲有預計對家之後一定有嘢講，回應定先，滿口歪理，不再回應。

527
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:40,350
哇！幾精彩啊！

528
02:22:40,630 --> 02:23:00,640
係一個全體委員會階段，真係我哋批評嘅人又即刻同我哋去互動嗱。主席，首先我要交代我咧公開咗講話，我今日咧或者我今次咧係會誒根據議事規則第四十條四咧係提出休會待續嘅動議，所以我今日行出行入咧。

529
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:13,610
都好多記者問我：，我哋幾時提啊？幾時提啊？嗱，因為咧，今次只係我第二次發言。我上一次發言咧已經係羊年啦，一月二十八號。咁上兩次二月廿四同誒。

530
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:22,680
在之前二月三咧，我都係因為流會未有機會發言。咁中間其實都好多議員係發過言，尤其是一啲建制派嘅議員咧。

531
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:42,970
佢哋關於限制合約零價嘅發言咧，我都係希望回應，甚至反駁。同埋咧，琴日咧，同埋今日都有好多建制派嘅議員咧，係引用咗大律師公會嗰兩篇嘅意見書，同埋咧，有啲議員咧喺再早之前嘅會議，可能大家。

532
02:23:42,970 --> 02:23:46,150
都唔記得啦，就引用咗律師會嘅意見書㗎。

533
02:23:46,430 --> 02:23:57,940
咁所以咧，我想先先喺呢一節咧，就係回應咗呢一啲嘅講法嚇。但係呢度咧，我亦都希望中谷局長，局長咧，琴日。

534
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:07,790
就話唔係琴日啦嚇，即係呢嘅呢個禮拜日已經係即係開我拖嘅啦，即係公開就話我變本加厲啊嘛，我係考慮提出。

535
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:28,080
我係誒中止待續，係詢問主席嘅意見啫。啊，主席係星期一就話畀我聽係可以嚇，我係想局長係面對現實。而家剩翻七個鐘頭，回頭試案，佢叫議員通過法案。我想同局長佢對唔住，如果原封不動，冇經。

536
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,620
議員修正案。

537
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:50,050
嘅二零一四版權修訂條例議案係絕對冇可能喺餘下嘅七個鐘頭通過，未來亦都冇可能通過。但係係咪唔能夠通過咧？絕對唔係，機會處處回頭視案嘅係應該係局長，局長應該攞翻嚟嘅法案落嚟。

538
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:51,720
應該。

539
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,330
聽，甚至係建制派、自由黨嘅意見。

540
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:58,780
去考慮限制。

541
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:04,470
公平使用嘅呢個修正案，去收窄大家嘅。

542
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:11,540
距離我歡迎你喺任何時間再拎上立法會，係同大家討論。

543
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:21,570
不過今日我都仲係要叫局長回頭視案，就係我我今節唔提休會動議，我希望局長提，點解希望局長提咧？

544
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:24,510
因為我提就叫做搞亂當。

545
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:28,820
局長提就叫做大局為重，仁至義盡。

546
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:39,550
就算我一陣間提辯論到聽朝，你哋又要否決我，跟住局長提，你又要贊成局長，係咪好矛盾咧？阿黃國健議員今朝嘅團隊講真係好矛盾啊！

547
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:46,670
但係冇計，要跟大隊政治不正確。如果唔係支持我，所以我又問嗰啲建制議員，不如你哋提啦。

548
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:57,710
你哋提點解提嘅好處係乜嘢咧？嗱，我一陣間如果提先講，但係因為我提唔會通過啊嘛，你哋提會通過啊嘛。

549
02:25:57,990 --> 02:26:18,000
局長，如果你聽日十二點九字題，噉你即係唔畀議員辯論啫，即係焗住大家投票。如果辯論去到一點完，又處理唔到啦。咁條議案又條條揈喺度嗱。今日林鄭月娥司長啊啊，主席，你應該收到信啦嚇，叫誒十六號嘅會議咧就提。

550
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:29,460
提出議案調動議程，令到立法會先行審議臨時撥款決議案，當然係贊成啦。其實我哋後邊仲有好多議案，今日嘅議程跟住落去都有破產條例。

551
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:32,700
如果你琴日提咗，噉我哋破產條例都過咗。

552
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:53,050
過一條又少一條，又鬆一鬆動一下，但係就係鬥氣。其實好多建制派心裏邊都唔係好舒服。不過而家唔同你講，我珍惜時間去回應咧大律師公會嗰兩封咧，你哋當咗聖旨啊，啊當咗如獲至寶，金科玉律。我真係唔明白。

553
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:53,810
嘅其實。

554
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:58,460
嗱，律師嘅嘢咧，十個律師咧，十一個意見。

555
02:26:58,740 --> 02:26:59,930
係嘛？

556
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:01,250
即係。

557
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:06,650
大律師公會同律師會都會開火啦，係咪啊？

558
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:20,410
附爭議性嘅議題好多，大律師公會過去亦都發過好多意見書，我從未見過特區政府係咁重視大律師公會嘅意見書嘅。

559
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:22,350
係嘛？

560
02:27:22,810 --> 02:27:36,300
呢個當時呢個政改方案，大律師公會嗰啲意見，你哋有冇接受過啊？有冇魚獲至寶，摘地有聲，捧到上天啊？去帶翻啲建制派啊！

561
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:44,370
其實喺呢個辯論過程，當然你可以引用辯論其中一個嘅一個訴諸權威。

562
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:50,610
即係權威人士同我，我萬必講同阿大律師公會主席講，唔好睇內容。

563
02:27:51,160 --> 02:28:11,170
佢應該權威過我，但係掃諸權威之後，我哋都要睇內容，睇翻佢講嘅嘢究竟成唔成理。喺度咧，我好大膽咁批評，雖然我冇乜受過法律嘅專業訓練，但係律師公會呢兩封信咧係非常之粗疏，尤其是係三月一號所。

564
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:15,140
發出去所謂追擊鍵盤戰線。

565
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:35,430
嘅文章嗰封信咧，簡直係泥張摔角啊！我未見過大律師公會咧，會同一個民間團體追住咧，係發多份嘅意見書咧，去同佢即係好似嗌交咁咧。我唔我唔係最後一個收最後一個收聲就贏，即係講最後一句嗰個就贏。反而鍵盤戰士而家話咧，唔鬼回應你啦！

566
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:39,020
即係費事寫翻篇文回應你啊！記者問到就答兩句。

567
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:43,430
嗱，我首先都講唔曬咁多，佢哋呢啲。

568
02:28:43,760 --> 02:29:00,990
條文嘅問題啦，我引用第一份大律師公會嘅誒意見書，係二月十七號嘅第三部分法例零價合約條款。嗱，佢嘅講法同我哋又唔同㗎，我哋叫做限制合約零價性，佢就叫做法律零價合約條款。其實講緊係同樣嘅嘢嚟嘅。

569
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:20,240
法律凌駕合約條款嘅修訂建議，係指法律賦予豁免權高於版權擁有人同用户之間嘅使用協議，明啦。因此，版權擁有人同用户不能再合約裏訂定條款，增加、刪除、擴闊或收窄法例指定嘅任何豁免。

570
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,210
嗱呢句我係睇唔明嘅。

571
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:25,640
有好多議員咧，就照讀咗出嚟。

572
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:40,920
大家知道，如果法例賦予咗豁免，你要刪除、你要收窄，當然就唔得啦。如果我哋係限制咗合約嘅靈活性之後，但係點解增加同擴闊唔得咧？

573
02:29:41,350 --> 02:29:47,850
呢個我係唔明㗎，可能律師大陸律師公會佢有背後更深嘅理據，但係我淨係睇完呢段。

574
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:54,830
不足以説服我，我而家反駁啊！當我當法例上，譬如侍產假。

575
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:57,040
係三日。

576
02:29:57,370 --> 02:30:00,930
係五份四嘅人工，啊！呢個係法例嘅。

577
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:11,520
係咪我同我嘅員工定定我放你七日，我畀十足人工或者我畀陪伴人工嚇，我獎勵你生仔呢個合約會失效咧？

578
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:14,970
或者係犯係唔會㗎嘛？

579
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:24,920
點解通過咗法例凌駕合約條款之後，會令到民間或者私人訂立嘅合約係唔能夠增加同擴闊咧？

580
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:27,440
我係完全唔理解。

581
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:29,920
除非係一個情況。

582
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:46,960
就係私人合約唔能夠令唔能夠犯法，我哋之前都講過好多啦。譬如我呢度唔準食煙嘅噉樣，跟住你個老闆同個客人就簽張合約話，我哋呢度係可以食煙嘅，咁當然唔得啦。控煙辦一樣可以上嚟去。

583
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:49,590
去捉你，係咪啊？

584
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:55,670
跟住佢第十八點括弧中文字一。

585
02:30:56,150 --> 02:31:14,660
佢話：此建議並不能消除大部分普遍使用者如網民嘅主要顧慮，因為網民作出改圖、Capt圖、舊曲新詞等行為前，甚少會與版權擁有人建立任何合約關係。

586
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:28,130
即係話網民同版權擁有人係唔會建立合約嘅，呢個錯。我哋議員講咗好多次，我哋買一套戲，買一隻碟。

587
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:47,340
當我哋拆開個封條，就已經係同嗰個版權擁嘅人建立咗合約，接受咗個合約㗎啦。當我哋睇一套戲，放咗一碟入去，睇佢開頭嗰段字，就已經係建立咗合約㗎啦。又或者我哋去down到一個game，一啲手機遊戲，你要kick kick kick kick。

588
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:52,650
嗰陣時，亦都係接納咗佢嘅合約㗎啦，點會係？

589
02:31:53,100 --> 02:32:07,900
唔會網民同埋版權用家人係唔會建立合約咧？呢個根本佢都唔佢都唔知自佢啲藝術師公會嗰班人都唔知有冇打機啊、玩機嘛、cap圖啊、改圖啊噉樣嚇。

590
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:18,980
仲有，如果嗰個合約裏邊寫住你不能嚇去搞我嘅任何公仔、任何畫面、cap圖、任何都唔得，因為佢all rights reserve。

591
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:28,290
所以呢個已經係錯，同埋另一樣咧就係唔單止係網民直接同合約擁有人去釐定呢個合約。

592
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:45,060
中介平台同版權擁有人亦都可以嚟訂合約。我哋成日話，譬如如果迪士尼同一個中介平台，例如Facebook，去嚟訂張合約，話我啲公仔係唔可以搞嘅，一條毛都唔掂得嘅，嚇唔可以變咗梁振英個頭啊噉樣。咁如果佢訂立咗呢個私人合約。

593
02:32:45,470 --> 02:33:05,480
咁咧，Facebook就有權將我嗰啲搞用佢啲迪士尼公仔搞梁振英嘅拎走㗎啦噃，因為我有同Facebook訂立咗合約㗎嘛，我當我開Facebook account嘅時候咧，我又要同意曬Facebook嗰啲條款，咁所以咧，如果有合有合約凌駕性咧，呢啲嘢就會被合約所廢除，即係話無論氣。

594
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:21,350
仿模仿挖機諷刺啊引用評論都係會廢咗武功。咁大律師公每年呢個第一個point都唔掂嘅。我即係有啲人就話垃圾不如呢份，我就冇咁冇咁咪刻薄啦。我就非常粗疏。

595
02:33:21,910 --> 02:33:23,280
我望緊醫院。

596
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:41,150
我 wish the international community would truly understand that in Hong Kong, we honestly care about intellectual property, copyright, the protection of, and so on and so forth.

597
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:49,220
Our concerns, our jitters in Hong Kong regarding this particular.

598
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:52,040
《Copyright Amendment Bill》。

599
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:55,760
係，essentially political。

600
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:58,040
only a couple of days ago.

601
02:33:58,570 --> 02:34:02,910
我，came across some Reuters copy.

602
02:34:03,190 --> 02:34:16,110
say well the headline goes something like it calls itself exclusive, it says major powers team up to tell China of concerns over new laws.

603
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:32,130
What major powers—the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and the European Union—and what new laws in China? Well, there are five of them apparently, and one of them.

604
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:37,160
是這草案《 cyber security law》。

605
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:57,690
在 mainland China， it's a very rare joint move， according to Reuters， for the five ambassadors to make the same concern to Beijing， to try to pressure the Chinese administration into taking their objections， very

606
02:34:57,690 --> 02:34:58,640
Seriously.

607
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:08,840
what I'm trying to say here is, if outsiders are concerned about new Chinese law,

608
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:13,120
Concerning cyber security and things.

609
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:15,370
here in Hong Kong.

610
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:26,280
under one country two systems， we're just as nervous。 we have every reason to be even more nervous。

611
02:35:27,350 --> 02:35:47,360
This new cyber security law is still a draft only. Says something like it's going to the cyber security draft in China is going to give sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats and from.

612
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:54,880
從廣泛的審查到強化對某些技術的控制。

613
02:35:56,560 --> 02:36:12,870
所以foreign country，the foreign companies in particular are not too pleased about this. And another feature of this new cyber security law in China, just one paragraph, please bear with me.

614
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:29,790
是，根據《路透社》的抄本，就《草案》《網絡安全法》，所有五位大使都特別關心由條款要求公司、企業，儲存資料本地。

615
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:45,360
和提供加密鍵，這些科技公司，或許會影響隱私，和意味他們必須傳遞敏感的知識產權。

616
02:36:45,740 --> 02:36:50,450
到政府，以名義安全。

617
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:55,830
That's what they find very, very worrying.

618
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:58,770
now，back to Hong Kong here。

619
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:04,090
Of course, we run under one country, two systems.

620
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:08,290
and all these political jitters.

621
02:37:09,140 --> 02:37:10,930
Are here to stay.

622
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:27,480
I'm sure, Mr. President, you've come to know that the American Consul General in Hong Kong has actually visited Letchko here, not just myself but also Slowbe, Tambeet.

623
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:28,920
In particular.

624
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:34,350
The two of us, at least, to try to lobby us to.

625
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:38,540
pass this amendment bill.

626
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:58,930
at hand, saying that that would be doing copyright owners, holders in the United States when it comes to trade and transactions and what have you, Hollywood movies included, a huge favour and so on and so forth. I'd like the American Consul General.

627
02:37:58,930 --> 02:38:01,230
In Hong Kong, to realise that.

628
02:38:01,510 --> 02:38:08,910
This is not just about business copyright. We're trying to protect.

629
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:15,640
在香港，as I told him at the time，it's a matter。

630
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:17,420
政治。

631
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,080
It, it's all.

632
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:33,560
A matter of politics, and of course, I'm not saying here. Oh, there are political worries, and so we need to sacrifice copyright or intellectual property protection.

633
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:40,500
to politics. Oh, they're they're political players. So they are playing the game. No, that's not.

634
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:43,870
我，我，我係講，係。

635
02:38:44,490 --> 02:38:46,460
what I am saying.

636
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:47,860
作為。

637
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,890
political。

638
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:58,880
worries are so valid, are so legitimised, they're all for real.

639
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:04,070
One country, two systems. We're supposed to have our own say on things.

640
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:12,390
everything, practically, other than defence and diplomacy, right?

641
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:18,020
但no，香港 has been quite so what I call mainlandised.

642
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:21,690
colonised， at the same time。

643
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:30,890
政府實際 acknowledge，了，

644
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:51,570
是 flawed。 It's not perfect yet, but the government claims it's quite willing to look into things, and we can have more revisions and discussions and what have you afterwards. But pass it first. The passage we need it first.

645
02:39:51,570 --> 02:39:52,770
哈哈哈。

646
02:39:53,050 --> 02:39:53,850
啊！

647
02:39:54,130 --> 02:39:58,340
所以，它 boils down to a question of trust.

648
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:07,850
and we simply do not have trust between the people and the government in this city.

649
02:40:08,130 --> 02:40:16,270
and please note the word complete lack of trust, complete with a capital C.

650
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:27,910
所以政府説：，它 may not be perfect yet， but allow us to make it better, if not actually perfect，之後。

651
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:29,970
bear with us.

652
02:40:30,730 --> 02:40:33,640
Do you trust this government?

653
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:46,180
Allow me to repeat, Mr. President. I actually talked to two veteran China watchers, very thoroughly about this particular bill.

654
02:40:47,880 --> 02:41:07,890
我問他們， we're no we're not lawyers, no we're possessing no legal knowledge, and we're not IT experts either. But from a common sense point of view, what do you think? It's a matter of trust. So do we trust this CYLEN ratio?

655
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:12,930
about making things better afterwards, and both of them.

656
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:17,440
both of them，almost in a chorus。

657
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:22,700
told me, gave me a categorical no.

658
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:27,160
我們不信任這政府。

659
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:39,210
And of course, the government will again, the officials will come back to say, oh, we've come on, you guys are very greedy, you're insatiable.

660
02:41:39,490 --> 02:41:46,620
政府已經作出讓步。上次，我們都記得那場鬧劇。

661
02:41:47,610 --> 02:41:50,430
about four or five years ago.

662
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:51,290
嗯。

663
02:41:52,260 --> 02:42:08,150
The government has now allowed exemptions regarding pastiche, caricature, and I've forgotten now humour or irony to that effect. Anyway, right? But it's just not enough.

664
02:42:08,470 --> 02:42:11,480
Of course, it's not enough. Otherwise.

665
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:20,610
my very honourable friend here, Dennis Quock, wouldn't have raised this contract override amendment.

666
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:25,540
他 finds it absolutely necessary.

667
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:31,680
And if minus the word absolutely, I'm sure.

668
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:37,130
Mr. Kwok's professional colleague, Gladys Lee.

669
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:40,440
also finds it.

670
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:43,510
fairly， if not absolutely。

671
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:47,050
necessary，and that's why she made her statement.

672
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:54,010
today, in support of what we have been fighting for here.

673
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:57,810
And I did say， our。

674
02:42:58,090 --> 02:43:04,280
政治性 distrust， now mind you， it's not mistrust， it's distrust。

675
02:43:04,970 --> 02:43:07,410
stems from

676
02:43:08,270 --> 02:43:13,030
The fact that Hong Kong's being mainlandised, colonised.

677
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:20,470
The CYL regime is not running Hong Kong. It is ruining Hong Kong, for sure.

678
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:31,980
just to give you a tiny bit of examples as to why we're we're we're so full of anger, frustration, resentment.

679
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:34,350
到到點，那我們有冇？

680
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:36,550
trust for this government.

681
02:43:37,070 --> 02:43:38,260
for this bill.

682
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:50,390
As we're talking about the number of Chinese tourists last year in Hong Kong, forty-six million, and they're already crying bloody murder or something.

683
02:43:51,010 --> 02:43:56,870
when the number of tourist arrivals to the whole of the United Kingdom.

684
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:58,420
last year。

685
02:43:59,150 --> 02:44:01,450
Thirty-six million.

686
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:11,150
us， a tiny city， 46 million， and the government says our tourist arrival numbers are down and we're dead meat already。

687
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:13,240
Mainlandisation。

688
02:44:14,790 --> 02:44:30,730
And the proportion of Hong Kong's external trade involving China is up to 50% colonisation, and the proportion of Hong Kongers who identify themselves as solely Chinese.

689
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:37,560
It's down to eighteen one eight percent. So this is the sentiment in this tongue.

690
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:39,220
and this is why.

691
02:44:39,510 --> 02:44:41,200
however。

692
02:44:42,490 --> 02:44:44,810
We agreed at copyright.

693
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:51,910
保護或知識產權保護，是just as sacred as motherhood。

694
02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:54,480
Well, most of the time, anyway.

695
02:44:55,950 --> 02:45:00,190
We're against what's in this particular bill.

696
02:45:00,830 --> 02:45:08,160
as it is, we just cannot agree to it. It's not agreeable at all.

697
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:20,840
and of course you've heard of local media self-censorship, self-censorship, it's rampant.

698
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:22,320
在香港。

699
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:36,440
And that's why more and more people are going online. We go online to get information that has not been self-censored. Thank you very much. And we also

700
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:52,050
try to get information that definitely not has have not been officially vetted. Again, thank you very much. So as a result, online media these days.

701
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,890
Have earned the label, the tag as.

702
02:45:57,280 --> 02:46:01,570
第五， estate of a modern society.

703
02:46:01,990 --> 02:46:11,650
after the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches, and after the fourth estate.

704
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:21,140
of the society, meaning the media, the traditional, the conventional media. So online freedoms.

705
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:24,880
而more than just treasured in Hong Kong.

706
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:37,350
people are saying, netizens are saying, they'll fight to the last breath to defend whatever freedoms they've got.

707
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:39,880
在香港。

708
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:54,200
And of course, when it comes to local media, can I remind you, our top English daily, I mean there's only one basically, called the South China Morning Post, has just been bought by Alibaba.

709
02:46:55,080 --> 02:47:15,090
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just red media in Hong Kong. This is red star over Hong Kong. I think this is a debate on contract overriding. For the past 15 or 13 minutes, you have not, you know, spoken on contract overriding.

710
02:47:15,090 --> 02:47:28,640
Would you like to come back to contract overriding? There's nothing to do with C M P or whatever. You know, it's contract overriding. Would you like to come back to the subject? Can I draw your attention to the fact that?

711
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:42,150
We're talking about contract override for sure, and my colleagues on this side of the chamber have categorised, listed a number of reasons already.

712
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:43,430
and.

713
02:47:43,810 --> 02:47:45,180
I'm telling you.

714
02:47:45,460 --> 02:48:00,040
as to why even if some of us would agree that this contract override is still debatable, let's wait till after the passage of this bill.

715
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:04,770
They would still tend to agree at this juncture.

716
02:48:05,320 --> 02:48:12,190
that we have to say no to the bill as it is, because of political jitters.

717
02:48:12,470 --> 02:48:22,920
That's the point. And what political jitters I'm trying to reply. This is the competing stage on contract overriding. Would you like to come back to the subject, or otherwise?

718
02:48:23,980 --> 02:48:26,520
神志全然。

719
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,690
玩嘢。

720
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:03,710
陳偉業議員。

721
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:06,550
我第一次警告你。

722
03:01:56,750 --> 03:01:57,930
武孟靜議員。

723
03:01:58,420 --> 03:01:59,300
係咪我啊？

724
03:01:59,950 --> 03:02:00,580
啊！

725
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:01,990
你講完啦嘛？

726
03:02:02,280 --> 03:02:07,510
我即係未啊！我仲有幾十秒㗎。係啊，所以我咪叫你無恆靜議員咯。係咯。

727
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:30,090
Exactly thirty seconds I've got left. The president proper just now managed to put up with me for thirteen plus minutes. I find it very curious the fact that you just sat down there and then you started challenging the content of my.

728
03:02:30,610 --> 03:02:48,690
一啲嘅爭議，我唔知點解會發生。我覺得呢個係一個好重要嘅議題。我哋嘅香港人，我哋嘅香港市民，我哋嘅香港人，我哋嘅香港市民，我哋

729
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:52,040
代主席。
