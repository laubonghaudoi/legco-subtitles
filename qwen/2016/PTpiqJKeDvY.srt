審議條例草案嘅委員會主席梁繼昌議員就委員會嘅報告向本會發言。

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:32,200
In my capacity as chairman of the Bills Committee on Inland Revenue, Amendment Number Four Bill 2015.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,800
The bill seeks to amend the Inland Revenue Ordinance to give profits tax concession to qualifying corporate treasury centres.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:22,470
The bill would also amend the stamp duties ordinance to give stamp duty relief in relation to regulatory capital securities.

17
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,250
通過《The Banking Ordinance》。

18
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,270
和銀行 capita rules。

19
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,530
under the inland revenue ordinance.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,110
是目前不税 deductible。

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,790
The Basel III capital adequacy requirements.

22
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,700
and their distributions are not deductible for profits tax purposes.

23
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,070
expressed as a percentage of their total risk-weighted assets.

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,600
A CTC is an in-house bank within a multinational corporation.

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:11,240
and to reduce the profits tax for specified treasury activities by 50%.

26
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,980
The Basel III requirements have been gradually implemented in Hong Kong since 2013.

27
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:55,670
但利息收入 arise from its intra-group financing business is chargeable to profits tax.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,920
利息開支由C.T.C. operating in Hong Kong， payable to an overseas associated corporation。

29
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:08,450
這些Tier Two或Tier Two instrument、Tier One或Tier Two instrument，是，然而，不被視為是dead instruments。

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,870
The bill seeks to change these rules and to allow such interest deductions under specified conditions for CTCs.

31
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:24,770
是最低標準，under which financial institutions must hold certain amount of regulatory capital.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:59,760
金融機構可能尋求遵守巴薩爾三要求，通過強化其資本基於，其中其他方式，發行額外Tier One或Tier Two工具，以籌集資金。

33
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,310
may qualify as a CTC.

34
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,990
under Hong Kong's current tax regime.

35
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,640
may benefit from the proposed tax measures.

36
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,860
如果它不接收股息從其集團公司。

37
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,840
Members have queried if an investment holding company.

38
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,840
for both deduction and taxation purposes, under the ordinance.

39
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,630
the bills committee supports the bill and the objectives it seeks to achieve.

40
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,710
which also carries out corporate treasury activities for other group companies.

41
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,750
and adding new provisions to treat a R C R C S as debt security.

42
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:46,600
The policy objective of maintaining a simple tax regime in Hong Kong remains unchanged.

43
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:15,720
The administration advises that a holding company which is also performing some CTC functions.

44
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:39,170
The administration explains that the proposals are introduced in line with evolving international development and standards.

45
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:04,870
所以，那 distributions arise from the security， other than the repayment of the paid-up amount， should be treated as interest。

46
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:29,940
Members have expressed concerns whether Hong Kong would gradually deviate from its simple tax regime by offering tax concessions from time to time.

47
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:48,380
The bill seeks to amend the inland revenue ordinance by defining regulatory capital security to cover an 81T2 instruments, that is essentially a debt in nature.

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:33,730
另一方面， sums received by a person as distributions of RCS or profits from the disposal or on the redemption of RCS are chargeable to profits tax under certain circumstances.

49
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,040
在提供信貸時。

50
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,860
The source of interest income.

51
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,220
在case of the operation test。

52
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,210
在其他部分的內地税收條例。

53
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,950
在 Assessing profits, tax or deductions.

54
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,970
The difference between the two tests is that.

55
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,920
The provision of credit test is normally used.

56
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,420
Whether or not the holding company receives dividends.

57
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,530
在確定的收入來源的CTC。

58
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,340
委員會指出，該法案採用操作測試。

59
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,100
to be subject to the concessionary tax in respect of its qualifying profits.

60
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,160
provided that it satisfies the criteria for being a qualifying CTC under the bill.

61
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:40,540
One looks to see what the taxpayer has done to earn the profit in question, and where he has done it.

62
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,630
and seventy five percent or more of the assets used to carry out corporate treasury activities.

63
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:03,620
從其集團公司，是 not relevant， as dividend income is not subject to tax in Hong Kong.

64
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:37,150
A safe harbour is introduced, which allows corporations having 75% or more of their profits derived from.

65
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,490
and a chargeable to profits tax.

66
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,930
follows the current practice in the Indian Revenue Department.

67
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,790
And would forestall aggressive tax-avoiding schemes.

68
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,690
for deeming interest income to CTCs as trading receipts.

69
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,290
The application of the operation test on interest income.

70
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,210
One member queries whether the use of the operation test.

71
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,520
It is necessary to include asymmetric tax treatment.

72
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,080
The bill dims interest income received by a CTC to be trading receipts.

73
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,750
and relevant gains or profits arise from an intra-group financing business.

74
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,160
this would avoid giving the impression that Hong Kong is becoming a tax haven.

75
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,830
The proposed provision of the bill would codify this practice and the legal principles involved.

76
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:54,740
是the place where the funds from which the interest income is derived were provided to the borrower.

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,420
arise in or derived from Hong Kong from a trade, profession or business carried on in Hong Kong.

78
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:35,350
The administration has assured the bills committee that no new taxation principle is introduced in the bill.

79
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,960
The administration explains that, as new tax deduction provisions are introduced for interest expenses by CTCs.

80
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,630
and the deeming provision would defeat the objective of promoting Hong Kong as a place for international corporations to set up CTCs.

81
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,280
In respect of that interest.

82
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,300
After the passage of the bill.

83
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,600
and practice notes to be issued.

84
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,950
行政會同意。

85
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,910
Some members query whether the requirements of subject to tax.

86
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,020
一公司，which has to pay tax in respect of an interest.

87
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,450
refers to tax that has been paid or will be paid.

88
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,430
And no change is to be made to existing taxation principles.

89
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,140
After setting off its loss against the profits, will be considered as having been subject to tax.

90
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,460
The company incurs a substantial loss for a long period, and has not paid any tax.

91
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:53,280
The subject to tax condition would not be regarded as having been satisfied if, for example.

92
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,660
和 whether interest deduction would be allowed if the lender is in a loss situation.

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:52,800
The bill proposes that a CTC in Hong Kong may deduct interest expenses on money borrowed from a non-Hong Kong associated corporation.

94
00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:03,940
provided that the amount of interest received by the non-Hong Kong associated corporation is subject to a similar tax in a territory outside Hong Kong.

95
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:16,250
The Inland Revenue Department would elaborate the application of the subject to tax condition in departmental departmental interpretation.

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:32,230
行政解釋，那，個概念的替代税，包括案例，當税已經繳納，和税將會繳納。

97
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,380
The bill deals with profits and deductions.

98
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,790
of the tax deduction provisions of the bill.

99
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,200
and the amount of deduction allowable costs and expenses.

100
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,030
In respect of a transaction between a company and a financial institution.

101
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,230
是 not to exceed the amount that would have been incurred by the Hong Kong branch on this basis.

102
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,840
by allocating a large proportion of the RCS to its branch office in Hong Kong.

103
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:46,780
一些成員有表達過擔憂，是否包括這條特別的企業條款？

104
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,830
arise from the issuance of RCS through a Hong Kong branch of a multinational corporation.

105
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:25,910
profits will be attributed as if the Hong Kong branch and other parts of the financial institution were separate enterprises.

106
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:54,610
might put Hong Kong at an disadvantage, as similar restrictions are absent in other tax regimes.

107
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,750
arise from the transaction in RCS between the Hong Kong branch and its parent company, parent institution.

108
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:33,350
臂長指的係條件，兩方交易的參與方沒有任何關係。

109
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:18,380
在certifying the chargeable profits of the Hong Kong branch of an overseas financial institution, whose capital is raised through the issuance of RCs,

110
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:06,570
The administration advises that the proposed provision was introduced as a safeguard against potential abuse by non-resident financial institutions.

111
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:48,270
The administration advises that a more stringent test is to be applied, in order to align with the latest international practices for prevention of tax avoidance.

112
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:35,140
成員們也查詢過，為什麼該法案在決定是否允許在CPC上扣除利息支出時，比在其他情況下更為嚴格？

113
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,250
for the avoidance of doubt.

114
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,320
It would not be beneficial to Hong Kong.

115
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,540
with both the features of debt and equity.

116
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,200
The administration subsequently advises that.

117
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,540
Taking into account the concerns expressed by the sector.

118
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,890
The bill includes a section 17H to specify.

119
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,090
因為LCS係高利率混合工具。

120
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,280
行政 advises that such provision is necessary.

121
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,910
行政解釋，那，the arms-length principle enables the inland revenue department.

122
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,590
and suggest that the administration reconsider the need for such provision.

123
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,860
and the advice from the Bills Committee over the interpretation of the proposed Section 17H.

124
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:13,930
一些成員已反映該業界對此條款可能影響非銀行公司的運作表示擔憂。

125
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:36,040
If a non-resident financial institution could enjoy huge tax deduction by allocating excessive RCS to its local Hong Kong branch office,

126
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:05,650
To determine accurately and objectively the profit that a branch office of a non-resident financial institution generates in Hong Kong from the transactions in RCS.

127
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:46,700
Some members have queried whether it is appropriate to apply the arm's length principle to handle the relationship between a non-resident financial institution and its local branch office in Hong Kong.

128
00:13:44,540 --> 00:14:03,410
that the provisions applying the arm's length principle and separate enterprise principle in connection with transaction in RCS will not affect the operation of other provisions under the inland revenue ordinance that apply the same principles.

129
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,890
And next.

130
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,110
在這 respect。

131
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,440
That is 8.25%。

132
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,510
要 allow a corporate borrower.

133
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,800
第二係要 mandate I O。

134
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,580
先生，主席，這條法案有兩個主要目的。

135
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,260
for qualifying CTCs with qualifying profits.

136
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,210
要移除，的提出第17H。

137
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,340
行政會將提出委員會階段的修訂。

138
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,290
and all references to the section from the bill.

139
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,290
I would like to give my personal views on this bill.

140
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,070
carry on in Hong Kong as an intra-group financing business.

141
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,640
Two important changes to the treatment of interest has been introduced.

142
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,870
One is to introduce a concessionary profit tax rate that is half of the standard tax rate.

143
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,650
委員會notes， The resumption of the second reading debate on the bill at today's council meeting.

144
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:21,700
第一目的係實施一個共同財政中心税制，為提供一個 conducive 環境，給多國企業到亞洲設立全球及區域 CTS、CTCs。

145
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,550
Under specified conditions.

146
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,440
deduction of interest.

147
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,880
那利息收入。

148
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,610
在jurisdiction outside Hong Kong.

149
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,480
which will require, amongst others.

150
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,210
The administration has also taken this opportunity.

151
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,290
as opposed to the provision of credit tests.

152
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,810
arising from the same loan transaction is subject to tax.

153
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,260
under this special set of circumstances.

154
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,510
to clarify the application of the operation test.

155
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,670
但 careful analysis of case laws and practice.

156
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,230
In order to minimise any chance of aggressive tax avoidance practice.

157
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,280
payable on money borrowed from a non-Hong Kong associated corporation.

158
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,030
Mr. President, this indeed has created some controversies during the committee stage of the bill.

159
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:41,290
for the ascertainment of interest income subject to profits tax under the CTC regime.

160
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:06,300
have drawn most parties, including myself, to the observation that this is indeed the right approach to ascertain the taxability of interest income.

161
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,960
Next.

162
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
In fact.

163
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,960
under the RCS regime.

164
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,150
第二個目的係。

165
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,360
被 treated as debt instruments.

166
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,790
我會嘗試 Highlight 一 few Lessons。

167
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,440
Well, after the passage of this bill.

168
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,390
一 major tax uncertainty for banks.

169
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,340
which possess hybrid features of debts and equity.

170
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,800
which issue additional tier one and additional tier two instruments.

171
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,960
金融機構，無論有總部喺香港或 not。

172
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,150
which I repeatedly point out to the government in the past two years.

173
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,690
是 to clarify the tax treatment of regulated capital securities (RCS).

174
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:39,240
我因此相當 happy，that the government has taken my suggestion and implemented legislation to clarify the tax position.

175
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:12,640
Distribution from these instruments will be treated as interest for interest deduction and assessment of profits tax purpose.

176
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:29,380
我有，and I would like to share this with my fellow colleagues. Being the chairman of this bills committee and other revenue-related bills committee.

177
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,870
second.

178
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,350
Mr. President, next.

179
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,660
my third observation.

180
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,580
to narrow down any differences.

181
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,520
Revenue bills are always very technical.

182
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,670
although there were only three committee meetings for this bill.

183
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,720
任何 ambigu ambiguity must be avoided.

184
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,480
和部門的解讀和實踐註釋。

185
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,600
In order to expedite the legislative process.

186
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,570
I would like to look at the macro policy implications of this bill.

187
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,170
和法律，我 believe 必須被草擬成平實語言。

188
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,240
before attending the meeting and facing questions before the members of the Bills Committee.

189
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,290
我會勸兩者，即係部門，要有個清晰的主意喺度。

190
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,190
There have been indeed far more behind-the-scenes meetings and discussions in order to expedite the passage of the bill.

191
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:54,380
我認為，必須有明確的分界線，將要處理的內容，與主要立法。

192
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:29,290
The chairman of any bills committee must have a keen interest in the subject matter, and be able to actively engage all relevant parties.

193
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,020
我 believe。

194
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,040
我會想引用幾個數字。

195
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,100
香港會，我 hope。

196
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,560
Indeed，upon reflection。

197
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,260
on 25 March for corporate treasury activities.

198
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,530
regain its rightful position in this index next year.

199
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,410
作為鄰居，正漸漸追上，甚至可能超越我們。

200
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,680
Our tax environment may not be as competitive as five or ten years ago.

201
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,370
This is in direct response to the impending passage of this bill.

202
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,790
yet Hong Kong still has clear advantages in certain other areas.

203
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:42,580
香港，作為一個企業財務中心，仍然非常吸引。

204
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:58,350
一啲的macro policy reasons for introducing the bill is to improve Hong Kong's role and competitiveness as a prime financial centre.

205
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:21,720
however，香港should not become complacent nor dismissive about what we have achieved，or what we are going to achieve as a major financial centre.

206
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:13,650
新加坡最近將其營業税率，對CTC活動，從10%降至8%。

207
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:34,590
Although Hong Kong has slipped from the third position to fourth position as a global financial centre in accordance with the Global Financial Index published by the Exact Yang Group.

208
00:20:50,660 --> 00:21:03,080
An objective analysis will support that, after the passage of this bill, Hong Kong will still be as attractive as Singapore as a location for CTC.

209
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,050
作為領先金融中心。

210
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,350
800億美元在新加坡。

211
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,680
amount of assets owned by the banking sector.

212
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,640
versus 14 billion US dollars in Singapore.

213
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,350
在新加坡，需要預 approval 和清關程序。

214
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,630
先生，我會考慮以下兩項税收政策，需要考慮為優先事項。

215
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,820
Indeed, looking into the future, there indeed are the tax measures which the government should make.

216
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,040
數目上，foreign banks in Hong Kong have 145 versus 117 in Singapore.

217
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,840
In order to enhance our position as a primary financial centre, while protecting our revenue base.

218
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,330
在香港，的公司就 simply 需要編譯和提交正常的年度税報。

219
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:50,340
作為一月二零一五，喺香港，我哋有二點四兆美元，versus。

220
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:33,000
The first of these is the due consideration of tax regime for the leasing industry, especially the aircraft leasing industry.

221
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:02,510
amount of corporate bonds issue and that was a two hundred and one four figure, thirty three billion US dollars in Hong Kong.

222
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:18,880
and indeed, simplified procedures in obtaining tax concession under the tax regime has put Hong Kong at an advantage.

223
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:07,630
Now, first of all, we note that Hong Kong does have, as a financial centre, has certain international obligations to fulfil, whether they are evoked by the OECD, G20 or other supranational organisation.

224
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:21,730
But we need to conserve our resources and energy to make things work for Hong Kong, and to push out other tax policies favourable to the sustainable development of Hong Kong.

225
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,580
我會勸。

226
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,890
There are two directions.

227
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,860
財經事務及庫務局局長。

228
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,800
有冇其他議員要發言？

229
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,770
第二方向，Mr. President。

230
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,550
and also, corporations to issue green bond in Hong Kong.

231
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,350
But I also note that any policy conducive to air leasing, aircraft leasing.

232
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,150
主席，我已 conclude 我的報告，並已做過我需要的 Remarks。

233
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,590
may also be applicable to ship leasing, as the tax principles are basically the same for the two industries.

234
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:16,170
The parties and my colleagues across the spectrum in this chamber to give support to this bill. Thank you.

235
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:55,850
税 incentives can be considered to encourage private equity business investing into green business.

236
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:06,550
And second, will be to extend the depreciation allowance to the user of leased aircraft or ships.

237
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:58,040
for a tax regime conducive to the leasing industry, one is to offer a special tax rate for the industry.

238
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:18,190
政策-wise，我會belief， it is difficult to explain why the government should favour one industry to another in offering a concessionary tax rate.

239
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:30,120
And for that reason, as a gut reaction, I personally would prefer a revamp of the depreciation allowance regime on plants and machinery used by business.

240
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:46,990
The recent release of the report on Hong Kong as a regional green finance hub by the Financial Services Development Council a few days ago is indeed an encouraging effort and achievement.

241
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,620
即係百分之八點二五。

242
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,360
嚟到條例草案嘅審議工作順利完成。

243
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,860
將定為現行企業利得税率嘅一半。

244
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,220
政府研究委員會提出嘅意見之後，收議。

245
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,360
為使利息收入嘅税務處理達至對稱。

246
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,390
我都感謝不同團體向法案委員會表達意見。

247
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,530
誒法案委員會今日舉行咗三次會議，討論條例草案嘅內容。

248
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,730
同時，佢同時條例草案調整現行嘅利息扣除規則。

249
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:12,250
容許在香港經營集團內部融資業務嘅企業借款人。

250
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:16,460
條例草案旨在提升香港吸引企業財資中心落户嘅優勢。

251
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:08,890
建議修正若干條文，我會稍後喺喺喺稍後嘅全體委員會審議階段動議有關嘅修正案。

252
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:26,230
為此，條例草案定明適用於合資格企業財資中心嘅利得税寬減税率。

253
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:58,680
亦可以按半額税率課税，我相信呢個有助吸引更多企業在香港經營財資業務。

254
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:41,010
誒主席，我感謝二零一五年税務修訂第四號條例草案法案委員會主席梁繼昌議員同埋各位委員所付出嘅努力。

255
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:48,500
條例草案亦訂立咗安全港規則，使使利用使利潤主要來自經營企業財資活動，而資產亦主要用於該等活動嘅企業。

256
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:27,120
在符合指明條件嘅情況下，從應平税利潤應平税利潤中扣除向非香港商聯法團借款所需支付嘅利息。

257
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,010
視為利息開支。

258
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,780
非香港商聯法團。

259
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,840
為壓制税基。

260
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,460
並支持條例草案所載列嘅建議。

261
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,210
使就該等證券支付嘅款項。

262
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,710
政府在草擬條文時，以確保建議語。

263
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,670
償還該證券嘅已付數額除外。

264
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,370
侵蝕和利潤轉移而設嘅最新國際標準相符。

265
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:39,580
資本充足要求所發行監管資本債券嘅税務處理。

266
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:08,020
可於計算銀行嘅應平税利潤時，從利潤從利潤中扣除。

267
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:32,750
此外，條例草案再有條文，以釐清銀行為遵守巴塞爾協定三。

268
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:16,800
同時，現行市債券嘅分派或利潤款項為應課利得税。

269
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:06,930
法案委員會曾討論有關措施嘅涵蓋範圍、相關條件以及防止避税條款等。

270
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:48,400
有關嘅修訂，旨在把銀行發行嘅監管資本證券視為債務證券。

271
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:41,730
條例草案定明，如某集團在香港經營集團內部融資業務中，貸款與

272
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:57,010
則即使貸款是在香港境外提供，有關利息收入仍會被當作是源自香港的利息收入，需繳納利得税。

273
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,090
將如其他。

274
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,240
遵從適用嘅。

275
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,560
反對嘅請舉手。

276
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,220
條例草案亦便利銀行。

277
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,320
銀行業界對上述建議表示支持。

278
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,250
相應地，監管資本證券嘅轉讓。

279
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,620
條例草案亦定定咗適當嘅防止避税條文。

280
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,990
推動香港總部經濟及商業樞紐嘅發展。

281
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,710
債券相關嘅轉讓交易一樣，會獲印花税寬免。

282
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,220
我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

283
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:54,790
為咗執行條例草案所在的各項税務措施，税務局會在條例。

284
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:03,720
勘憲生效後，發出適宜及執行指引，詳細解釋技術細節及執行安排。

285
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:48,210
現在各位提出嘅代決議題係二零一五年税務修訂第四號條例草案，予以議讀。咁現在付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

286
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:26,380
嘅營業收入嘅規定，亦會適用於監管資本證券嘅分派或利潤款項。

287
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:37,960
國際監管資本要求，我懇請議員支持條例草案及各項稍後提出嘅修正案。主席，我僅此陳詞。

288
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:17,100
主席，條例草案對吸引更多企業在香港成立財資中心尤為重要，有助帶動對本地金融及專業服務行業嘅需求。

289
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,110
全體委員會審議階段，本。

290
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,130
二零一五年税務修訂第四號條例草案。
