14
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:22,170
第一項確認通過會議紀要。喺二零一六年十一月十一日嘅會議紀要咧，已經送畀各委員審覽㗎啦。

15
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:13,220
誒仲有誒運輸及房屋局嘅副秘長係劉家琪先生，誒機管局嘅行政總裁林天福先生，仲有機管局企業發展執行總監馮義先生。

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:56,020
噉啊誒議題第二咧，就係同政府當局同埋香港機場管理局啊舉行會議。噉我哋係先請誒政府同埋機管局嘅代表出席會議。

17
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,140
航空發展與機場三跑道系統諮詢委員會。

18
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,280
提供呢個諮詢業界同埋主要持份者嘅重要平台。

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,870
噉啊啊，係咪先請誒？

20
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,300
機管局同埋誒機管局同以以電腦投影嘅方法介紹一下三跑道。

21
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,850
系統發展嘅概覽。誒，主席有關工程範圍嘅最新進展係點啊？阿田一。

22
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:15,430
運作同時亦都係全球最繁忙嘅機場之一嘅誒香港國際機場，係進行咁大規模嘅擴建工程咧，佢個挑戰性咧，相信大家可以想像嘅。

23
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:52,380
並且妥善地落實，以並且充分咧係顧及成本效益。此外咧，政府亦都係成立咗由財政司司長主持嘅高層次跨局督導委員會，負責督導三跑道系統計劃嘅推展同埋實施，以及咧係由我主持嘅。

24
00:02:45,130 --> 00:03:05,140
神語言係嘛？誒唔係主席，我想作個開場發言。好啊好啊，阿局長唔該。係誒，主席，香港國際機場一直都係全球最繁忙嘅貨運機場，同埋第三大誒最繁忙嘅國際客運機場。喺舊年咧就誒機場嘅接待旅客係超過六千八百五十。

25
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:25,150
萬人次，而貨運量咧係接近咧係四百四十萬公噸，同埋依個升降航班係超過咗四十萬架次嘅。噉係再次刷新嗰個年度紀錄。今年頭十個月咧，航班升降已經係超過咗三十四萬架次，而旅客人數咧亦都係有約誒五千九百萬。

26
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:45,160
人次嘅分別係較去年同期增長百分之四同埋百分之二。現時嘅雙跑道系統已經係接近飽和，誒三巴系統係誒必須及早建成啟用，以應付持續增長嘅航空交通需求，並且係維持香港得嚟不易嘅全球航空樞紐地位。

27
00:03:45,160 --> 00:04:05,170
呢個對保持香港喺商貿、旅遊、物流、金融同埋國際交流等方面咧嘅競爭力都係至為重要嘅。就三跑道系統嘅發展同埋開放咧，特區政府同埋香港機場管理局過去曾經多次向公眾同埋立法會彙報同埋交代。隨住相關嘅法定程序喺今年四月。

28
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:25,180
完成咧，基建局已經喺八月一一號咧係展開咗三跑道系統嘅填海工程，而整個三跑道系統各項工程合共咧係預計需時約莫八年嘅。根據基建局估算，三跑道系統嘅建造成本按付款當日價格計算咧，係約莫係港幣一千四百一。

29
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,510
到。

30
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,720
唔該，Kevin。

31
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:08,540
對香港嚟講，務求係喺三跑道系統底下咧，係達到長遠最高容量目標咧，係每小時一百零二班次嘅。

32
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:10,180
考察係希望有關嘅誒活動咧，係有助議員進一步瞭解呢個三跑道系統工程嘅最新嘅發展，同埋機管局嘅運作。

33
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:22,980
Thank you, Chairman. Members, I'm delighted today to present to you an overview of the scope of the project and also our current progress.

34
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:20,840
誒三方係會切實合作，並且係會加強呢個技術方面嘅探討，以互利共贏為宗旨，係致力讓區域內咧各大機場，包括香港咧，都係可以長期持續發展嘅。

35
00:09:43,270 --> 00:10:01,490
Left foreground are iconic Terminal One building, but we will be expanding to a great extent. Terminal Two as a processing terminal, and have a new processing terminal building between what is the central runway, our current north runway, and the new third runway.

36
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:59,910
今年三月咧，國務院係發布關於深化泛珠三角區域合作嘅指導意見，當中係表明係支持香港三保道系統嘅計劃。喺國家銀行局嘅支持底下咧，三方亦都係簽署咗強化合作交流機制嘅協議，進一步係加強呢個合作聯繫。

37
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:49,730
更快、更方便嘅空運服務，以至係便利網購活動啊，同埋確保新鮮食材每日運送嚟講啊，呢啲好細微嘅嘢都係可以誒有幫助嘅。誒，現在主席透過你咧，係請機管局行政總裁林天福先生同埋嘅同事咧，係簡介呢個新跑道系統嘅計劃最新嘅發展。

38
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:45,190
十五億元工程嘅規模同埋投資浩大，係因為咧佢唔單止係誒只係興建一一條新嘅跑道，佢嘅主要工程係仲包括咧現時喺機場島北面係填海拓地，有冇係六百五十公頃？咁呢個相當於現時機場島一半嘅面積。誒興建第三條跑道同埋。

39
00:04:45,190 --> 00:05:05,200
相關嘅客運大樓、飛行區及呢個停機坪嘅設施，以及咧係新嘅旅客接運系統同埋行李處理系統，同埋咧係擴建現時嘅二號客運大樓等總規模咧，差不多係等同興建一個新嘅機場。要喺一個二十四小時不停。

40
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:35,720
誒政府係要求機管局係做到邊建設邊保育喺工程當中咧係切實履行咧喺環評報告當中嘅承諾，以及咧喺誒依個環境許可證所定嘅條件。運防局係成立咗機場擴建統籌辦公室，係密切監察機管局嘅工程，以確保三跑道系統及時。

41
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:20,960
主席，香港國際機場嘅擴充並且係需要喺珠三角地區空域管理上係作出配合。我哋過去已經指出，珠三角地區機場密集，可以用嘅空域係有限嘅，因此係必須尋求協調互利。就此咧，內地、香港同埋澳門三地嘅民航當局早已經成立咗三方公。

42
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:40,970
合作組，並且喺二零零七年係共同制定咗《珠三角地區空中交通管理規劃與實施方案二點零版本》，以透過短、中、長期措施去優化珠三角地區嘅空域結構。年嚟咧已經係成功循序落實咗一啲改善空域使用嘅措施嘅。

43
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:41,220
我哋係十分明白社會上對三跑道系統嘅關注，亦都係明白咧。三跑道系統嘅推展係需要受到社會同埋立法會嘅監察。就此咧，政府同埋機管局曾經喺上屆立法會嘅相關小組委員會上咧，係就三跑道系統嘅各項重要事宜，包括工程嘅範圍長。

44
00:07:41,220 --> 00:08:01,230
詳細嘅設計、財務安排、環境影響同埋空域管理等咧，係向議員交代同埋係進行討論嘅。我哋係樂意繼續向誒立法會彙報三跑道系統工程同埋其他相關嘅事務嘅最新進展，聽取議員嘅意見。如果得悉咧，係機管局將會安排議員咧明年係到機場行。

45
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:30,470
誒主席，我重申，建設三跑道系統對整個香港嘅經濟民生都係會帶嚟裨益嘅。並非係單單航空業受惠，對廣大嘅市民嚟講，三跑道系統係可以容納更多嘅航點同埋航線，令到佢哋外遊有更多新嘅目的地同埋行程嘅選擇，亦都可以提供。

46
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,920
And CLP are actually going to be conducting that, and they've already commenced that work.

47
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,940
Again, to take the baggage to and from the aircraft to the processing terminal at the expanded terminal two.

48
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:50,810
Of all of the necessary statutory approvals, and with a successful environmental permit, we've commenced work this year.

49
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:21,570
The runways and taxiways associated with a three-runway system, the new third runway passenger building between the runways.

50
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:39,780
所以那些係一些啲啟動工程，我們做啲啲工程，啟動我們

51
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:24,140
新 diversion being in the bedrock means it isn't subject to the pressures of the reclamation above, and therefore it maintains that link. And thereafter, from Shau Shau, we use the existing pipeline through to Tuen Mun.

52
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:43,140
That work has started actually back in 2015 with preparatory work. The drilling is ongoing now, and the extended the intention is to is to conclude that work and have it operating by the end of next year. And we are fully confident that we'll be able to achieve that date.

53
00:08:50,140 --> 00:09:10,150
唔該，就係啊，局長。噉啊，以下係由邊位誒？誒，多謝主席。誒，以下落嚟咧，我想請我哋負責就係三跑項目嘅總監誒潘嘉宏先生咧，就向大家誒介紹下我哋三跑道系統嘅整體規劃同埋誒工程嘅進。

54
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:43,270
As Secretary of Transport and Housing just mentioned, this project is similar to building a new airport alongside the existing airport, and I think this graphic shows very clearly what we aspire to in eight years' time to have produced: the third runway, operating as a full three-runway system, and you can see there in the.

55
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:22,650
Obviously, we've started construction, as just mentioned, in first of April. But this, of course, has come after an extensive planning exercise that has led us to this position. We first published and formulated our two thousand and thirty master plan, which promulgated the third runway project.

56
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:42,660
In consultation with public in two thousand and eleven, and obtained the government's approval in principle for the project in two thousand and twelve. We then embarked on a very very thorough environmental impact assessment, which concluded largely in two thousand and fourteen. And then after completion of

57
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:13,070
That was possible because during that process we proceeded with certain elements of design, and the project here, as you'll see in this graphic, comprises a very large reclamation. Six hundred and fifty hectares have to has to be formed new land to the north of our existing airport, to enable us to build.

58
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:41,860
We are also expanding the existing terminal two. That's the processing terminal where arriving and departing passengers will be processed. That will be adjacent to remain adjacent to terminal one. But it's a significant expansion of the the current terminal two, which is a departures only facility. This will be a full departures and arrivals process. It will.

59
00:11:41,860 --> 00:12:01,870
會被connected then to the new passenger building between the runways, the concourse where you get on and off the planes via a an APM system that will link that processing terminal to the passenger building. And similarly, a very extensive baggage handling, high-speed baggage handling system will need to be implemented.

60
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:31,160
So in terms of construction, an update. First of all, before we can complete certain elements of the reclamation, we have to divert two major utilities. You see in this graphic here, the aviation fuel pipelines. The aviation fuel pipelines currently run from the permanent aviation fuel facility.

61
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,360
嗯。

62
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,280
stable seawall over the top of it.

63
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,370
dredged all that out. That has a great environmental impact, and so this time we're leaving the muds in.

64
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,020
This is a technique. It's roughly about 40% of the site you can see is actually going to be done by deep cement mixing.

65
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:14,640
And we will be consolidating those muds to make them a stable platform for then the third element, which is the reclamation fill above.

66
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:52,410
In this, we consolidate the mud by injecting cement into it to make it a stable platform to be again to be able to support the reclamation material above it.

67
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:37,870
using the the traditional technique of using of compressing and getting the pore water out. So for that reason, we're using a technique called deep cement mixing.

68
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:28,780
所以， certainly in the next couple of years, a major element of our focus will be to the works that we're doing to the existing marine muds to make them stable platform for the the subsequent filling operation.

69
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:49,220
Cement into the marine muds. That that cement then forms a stable matrix with the the clay, and after between thirty and fifty days, it forms a very stable column that can then support the the weight above it.

70
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:08,870
layer of material on board, and then using those vertical drains to actually allow the pore water pressure to come out, thereby compressing the mud very quickly. It will do it then in months rather than years, and that means that all of the primary settlement in that material is taken out before we build the subsequent infrastructure above it.

71
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:51,170
在屯門，Across to沙角，and then from沙角到the the Island。The pipes from沙角 to the Island run currently just under the seabed. They're very safe where they are, but unfortunately, when we put the reclamation over the top, they will not be able to stand the very great pressures from the reclamation. So we have to divert that.

72
00:12:51,170 --> 00:13:11,180
link from Sharrow to the island. We do that using a technique called horizontal directional drilling. This is a technique from the oil industry where we drill a pipeline from the island down into the bedrock, 100 metres below the sea, and then arrive at Sharrow. So that's the line of the

73
00:13:44,380 --> 00:14:04,390
在相同附近，在重劃區，有條11kV電纜穿過重劃區，這條電纜也必須轉移。同樣，你會看到它進入沙洲海洋公園。我們不希望將電纜轉移進去海洋公園，所以我們要做的是將電纜轉移出去，並連接在海洋公園外。

74
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:24,400
So we're using environmentally responsible methods to waterjet the new cable in, and then we'll splice it to the existing cable 500 metres away from the marine park. That process will be done. It's a successful technique used very a lot by CLP.

75
00:14:41,640 --> 00:15:01,650
所以，所以這係The Footprint 650 hectares。There's three main elements of the reclamation that we have to do. There's the seawall which retains the edge of that reclamation. Has to be a robust seawall. We then, because for environmental considerations, we're leaving the the marine muds in the original airport construction. We

76
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:49,500
There's a number of techniques we'll be using, many of them tried and tested and used in Hong Kong before. You'll see a reference there to PVDs and stone columns. These techniques we're using in areas where we've just got normal marine muds. PVDs is where you compress the marine mud by putting in a surcharge, an extra

77
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:29,160
This site is is somewhat made more complicated by there are some disused contaminated mud pits. These were formed first started in the very early ninety s, even before the airport was constructed. Those those mud pits contain some elements of contaminated mud, and for that reason we don't want to disturb them by.

78
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:13,400
A little description of how that works. On the left, you see a cartoon of the sort of plant that does this. And in the stages, what what happens is we put down a sand blanket first of all on the existing seabed. That's to stabilise and keep the the existing marine muds from going up into the water column during the process.

79
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,670
嗯。

80
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,200
嗯。

81
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,990
要make sure that we don't overload the the marine muds.

82
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,870
plan to arrive in December, with a considerable number arriving in January and February next next year.

83
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,480
And one, these are going through the necessary licensing process with Marine Department to enable them to start construction.

84
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:21,570
Most of the barges are three or two axes. This is a four. This is the largest barge. We believe, possibly in the world, but it's certainly the largest barge we'll be using.

85
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:26,330
所以again，那technique is is commencing and we're preparing. With the first areas are the the DCM areas where the seawall will be constructed.

86
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:52,790
It's a very extensive process of getting these rigs ready for work in Hong Kong. These are just some pictures of a recent trip with me in in Busan, but they're being made in assembled and and made ready in China, Vietnam, Indonesia as well as Korea.

87
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:34,390
The first layer, first process then in the DCM is to to start putting down a geotextile and the sand blanket. Here you can see a rough plan of of where we're doing that under the sea walls. And that, as I say, those operations have already commenced and are quite far advanced in in advance of the DCM work starting.

88
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:33,410
We even in certain areas we put down a geotextile underneath that sand blanket to further contain those muds. We then using the DCM rigs, we put down similar to a bit like a corkscrew. We we put down into it agitators that screw down in through the muds, and then as they come back up, they turn and inject.

89
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:09,510
In the general reclamation areas, we'll be doing a number of clusters that will help support that the reclamation. And you can see on the diagram on the left, under the sea walls, we're also using all of the sea walls will have DCM under them in a series of interlinked walls that provide the lateral restraint to enable us to successfully build a sea wall.

90
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:54,720
And then we're laying a sand blanket on top of that. Now the sand blanket, learning from experience in other reclamation, it's very important that sand blanket is laid in thin layers. And so the traditional pelican barge, which you see there, rather than discharge directly into the sea, we are using a different technique.

91
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:14,730
We're using spreader barges, which mean that the pelican barge is discharged into that spreader barge. That spreader barge then gently lowers the sand down through the water column. That stops the sand mixing into the water column, so it means better water quality control. It also means much better control of the laying of the sand blanket in thinner layers.

92
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:47,480
所以，the next element is the actual DCM barges themselves. This DCM in this project is going to be the single biggest use of marine DCM in the world. It's been used extensively around Asia, in America, in Europe, often in marine environments. More more normally in on a land environment.

93
00:19:47,480 --> 00:20:07,490
The biggest exponent of marine-based material DCM is Japan and Korea, particularly Korea, and also the capabilities exist in China. So we're making use of the full market. We have awarded five DCM contracts commencing the one st of August. Those contractors are mobilising their considerable resources.

94
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:27,500
to provide in Hong Kong those DCM barges, and they're coming from. Some of the barges exist already, many of them. Some of them are actually being purpose built for this project. We have by early part of next year, we'll have nearly 30 barges in Hong Kong. Currently, we have four already mobilised.

95
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:14,110
This was the first barge pictured in actually in Korea, but this barge is now in Hong Kong waters and is being inspected by Marine Department. You'll see there that there are four individual axes. These, each one of those has four agitators from the for the DCM process. So this is actually the the largest most.

96
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,450
嗯。

97
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,250
啊！

98
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,470
誒點啊？

99
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,300
你好嘛？嗯。

100
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:09,650
All of those works, those underground and foundation works, we're programming to commence next year.

101
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:57,500
所以那些DCM works starts imminently， and particularly in the seawall areas is the is the first areas they'll be working on.

102
00:23:52,850 --> 00:24:01,350
And the first parts of the APM tunnel on the existing island, which, as you can see, go below our existing roads and also under the airport express line.

103
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:09,720
which will provide limousine coach staging, car parking, to allow it to function very efficiently in the same manner that we're familiar with with Terminal One.

104
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:20,290
Okay， I'm I'm happy to speed up if you like that. So let me. Okay， I'll proceed through. I'll just touch on. Well，我諗等潘家雲生誒繼續簡短啲，盡快講介紹完先，好冇？Okay。

105
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:18,160
所以，我們有let those five DCM contracts. We have also let the main reclamation contract, which will be build, which will be doing the other ground improvement techniques, and also be constructing the actual fill and seawall on top of the improved ground, marine muds.

106
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:31,500
The design has progressed. We this is a view now of the the design that we're proceeding with Terminal Two. It's a very elegant structure, but we're also very cautious. We're making sure that the it's buildable. It has simple structures.

107
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:43,060
Here's two other barges that arrived last that arrived last month. These were arrived on a semi-submersible ship. They were brought into Hong Kong waters. They're now successfully floating on their own and ready to commence work very soon. And this barge here arrived again last month. We have another eight barges.

108
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:39,740
We're also we have awarded most of the main consultancy contracts for the design of the major facilities, one of which is is as I've mentioned the terminal two. On this diagram here, you can see the small dotted square. That's the size of the existing terminal two, and you can see the

109
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:59,750
The our plan, we're we're we're considerably increasing the size of Terminal Two, turning it into a full processing terminal. So have arrivals and departing facilities, so as well as all the other facilities it needs to operate as a full processing terminal. So we're more than double the size of it. We will have a north and south annex built.

110
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:31,200
works that we can start next year means that although we we maintain terminal two in operation, as you can see, much of the footprint of the building is actually outside the existing terminal two, and for that reason we can start some of the extensive ground foundation works that outside the existing terminal, leaving that terminal two still in operation.

111
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:52,850
those foundation works apart from foundations for the building also include a substantial underground baggage hall for the high speed baggage handling system that will be installed to link it to the terminal building between the runways. We also have to substantially increase the APM system. We're building an APM depot, work of which has already commenced.

112
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,340
anticipate.

113
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,320
Thank you, Jim.

114
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,730
Construction commenced.

115
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,470
Our existing APM system, although the systems don't have to be the same.

116
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,660
And here's another view of the within the departures facility of that new building.

117
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,680
We're also putting in a high-speed baggage handling system, again linking the processing terminal to the terminal building.

118
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:55,210
Following members urging last time, we are pushing to get Hong Kong BIM Plus Gold, if not Platinum status for this building, to make sure that we have a true green credentials in this building.

119
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:59,880
To provide tunnels etc. underneath that existing runway, to make it a fully functioning runway, there will also be twin taxiways to the north of that existing runway, which don't exist at the moment.

120
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:48,710
The process, and in fact, invitations went out on the 1st of December for applications for funding. People are able to now apply for funding, and the intention is that those first funds will be available the middle of next year.

121
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:13,890
significant element of that is the marine ecology enhancement fund. I'll just take a few seconds to run through that. Members may recall it's 400 million in total, split between a fisheries enhancement fund and marine enhancement, marine ecology enhancement fund.

122
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:53,570
Environmental considerations are very important to us, and we have concluded all of the submissions that are necessary, that were committed to in the environmental impact assessment, and were requirements of the EP, all of which have to be commenced before.

123
00:24:41,170 --> 00:25:01,180
曬佢嗰啲，佢頭先啊總監講緊啲嘢，文件有㗎啦。佢不如留啲時間畀我哋去傾好嘛？你問佢仲有幾耐啫，主席。嗯，仲有幾耐時間？文件有曬㗎啦。如果文件有嘅，我諗唔好再重複咯，好唔好？唔好再重複，因為我已經睇曬文件先。

124
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:45,390
Okay, other aspects of the of the development obviously is is the third runway and extensive taxiway and apron systems. The north runway will be similar length to the existing runways, 3.8 kilometres, and there are extensive works that need to be done to the existing northern runway after we've completed the new third runway to allow us.

125
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:20,440
The third runway passenger building itself is a very very large building, two hundred and eighty three thousand square metres, with an apron which we currently programme for fifty seven stands for aircraft, and that is expandable in the future if if traffic continues to grow as we.

126
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:42,040
Here's a couple of views of the existing building or the building. Sorry, proposed as designed. We've only just commenced the design of this. These were scheme designs. This is a typical view of the departures facility. The important thing here is is that it maintains the high standards of that we're accustomed to in Hong Kong International Airport and a.

127
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:22,860
Very briefly, then on the automated people mover system, it's a very important must ride system. The two buildings are geographically remote, so we're putting in a very robust APM system linking Terminal Two to the new terminal building, using the latest technology APM systems, which have moved on significantly from our.

128
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:34,180
It's processed under two distinct committees, management committees that will have the independent ability to award funds for those under those reimbursements. In terms of where we are today, the management committees have now met and agreed.

129
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,860
嗯。

130
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,290
Okay, thank you.

131
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,570
啊，例如仲有誒九位啊，朱開迪議員。

132
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,710
嗯，第一個啊，田北城議員，唔該，誒，多謝主席。

133
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,190
NGOs, green groups, and also professionals and academics.

134
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:54,750
嗱，而家咧就有七位同事咧就排緊隊想問問題嘅。我督促個名單啊，到八位。

135
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:53,940
局長之前發生個航班消失十二秒事件啊，處長咧就話唔涉及安全，所以冇公佈。

136
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:45,780
主要我想問下局長咧，呢個新空管系統嘅問題，呢個問題咧同三跑絕對同埋非常之有關係。我遲啲解釋點解。

137
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:07,300
誒田北辰議員、姚思榮議員、陳淑莊議員、郭家麒議員、鄭松泰議員、盧偉國議員、譚文豪議員以及姚崇賢議員。

138
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:10,150
Very different debt structures and financial instruments that are possible to raise that funding, and it's expected that that consultancy will be able to recommend the financing structure by the middle of next year.

139
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:44,830
Close the existing northern runway, which will be the future centre runway for revision, with the view to having a full three-runway system completed and commissioned operating at the end of 2024. Thank you.

140
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:30,130
嗱，就我諗咧就每人連問連答五分鐘啦，好冇？誒，我喺度咧就提醒一下誒各位，如果有需要嘅話咧，誒你發言之前咧，請你先申報你嘅利益啊。OK。

141
00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:10,180
We're very also continuing with a lot of liaison. We have two sets basically under the community liaison groups. We've met twice with the the five groups, which are basically coordinated around the five district councils, and we have also set up a professional liaison group which contains members.

142
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:37,990
The financial arrangement is promulgated on a joint contribution principle. Thirty-three, forty-seven billion is anticipated to come from operating surplus, our revenue, an airport construction fee, some eighteen, twenty-six billion dollars, and then the borrowings of the airport authority itself.

143
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:58,000
The airport construction fee began commenced collecting on the 1st of August, at the same time as commencement of the reclamation works. Airport charges are being implemented now from the 1st of September, and the in terms of the financing plan, we have recently awarded a consultancy contract to analyse and identify the.

144
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:30,650
So to conclude, we're right at the beginning of this process now in terms of construction. We commenced in the first of August. Our key dates to aim for are the opening of the the new commission northern runway in two thousand and twenty two. That will allow us to.

145
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,440
呢個第一。

146
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,780
OK。

147
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,250
呢次咧就仲要停航十五分鐘先。

148
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,900
我想問嘅問題咧，就唔係嗰啲三樣嘢。我想問嘅問題就係。

149
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,630
我哋而家知道啲咩咧？主席，我淨係知道三樣嘢啫。

150
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:51,720
咁政府係咪保證，或者民眾係咪保證，你哋一定叻過印度咧？嚟搞得掂咧？

151
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:45,010
第三我所知嘅咧，就係三跑咧，就係今日個主賽咧，就係二零二三年殺到。

152
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,450
O.K.噉啊，傳媒咧又話印度新德里咧已經投降啦，已經唔用啦，因為佢搞唔掂。

153
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:36,970
噉啊！我唔知政府有冇去問清楚點解新德里機場投降啦？OK，呢啲嘢都係講緊幾億嘅嘢啦。

154
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:43,860
即係都唔知係乜，同埋分分鐘都唔知係真撞定假撞啦。可能噉我哋又唔知有幾多單啦，係咪？噉啊又係啦，We don't know what we don't know啦，主席。

155
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:33,700
咁但係有幾多冇公佈嘅咧？我哋又唔知，係咪？嗱，今朝啊，報紙頭版就講鬼機，噉我嚇死我！普通市民聽到鬼機真係～

156
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:59,950
第一呢套A.T.三即係雷神公司呢套A.T.三咧，係二零一一年買嘅，到今日搞咗成五六年，仲係不斷出問題。

157
00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:05,880
後來咧發生航機資料消失廿六秒事件咧，處長又話唔涉及安全，但係咧就即日公佈，仲要停飛十五分鐘。

158
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:19,320
第二咧，好似話全世界今日用緊雷神公司呢套AT三咧，就只有杜拜同埋新德里同埋唔知馬來，唔係孟卑幾個機場噉，全部喺印度嘅。

159
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:23,150
噉我靠邏輯去估計咧，佢哋有條線嘅，即係可能係廿分廿秒鐘到啦，即係廿秒鐘以下噉佢又唔公佈又唔停飛，廿五鍾廿五秒以上就覺得係大件事噉樣樣啦嚇。

160
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:12,010
噉你而家十二秒，你話冇問題啦。將來呢個咁多嘅飛機滿天飛啦，嚇多到三跑，再有十五秒嘅消失，係咪仲係冇安全問題咧？如果有噉啊，係咪要成日都要成日都要停飛咧？噉係嘛？咁所以其實我。

161
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,860
其實大家開會之前咧，我都提過啊，田議員咧。

162
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,180
公道啊！對我哋政事呢個系統本身嘅表現啊，啊。

163
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,380
誒處長個專業判斷咧，佢唔覺得而家嗰個系統咧係存在一個安全問題。

164
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:26,070
步跟得你嘅後塵，所以呢個系統唔會轉。因為如果你真係要更換個系統，你五年前要整個新系統，你仲有啲年領時間去搞呢個舊嘅，係咪？

165
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:28,880
係有一個專題係講呢個新行管系統嘅，咁所以我哋冇請處長嚟，所以好多技術問題咧，恐怕我因為最好去回答。但大底上嚟講噉樣嘅，我哋都我都有同處長好認真去傾。

166
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:45,270
誒喺聽到機管局方面嘅介紹咧，即係三炮系統可以順利咁開工啦，八一開始進入填海。噉我哋希望咧，即係能夠即係排機管局排除萬難啦，能夠按時完成個三炮系統。

167
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:30,050
不過，阿田議員提出嚟唔係主席，我點解今日要？O K啦，第二位。因為三跑可能要換咗個系統啊嘛。呢個今日我哋傾三跑啊，唔係傾個空嗰個空管系統。誒，隔下一位，阿姚思榮議員。誒，多謝主席，好高興誒。

168
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:36,190
新得你都投降啦，噉我哋唔知落去點嘅。噉我哋可能有一日都或者需要投降。咁第三跑二三年殺到啦。噉你冇一條死線，即係話你而家搞呢個系統一路試一路試，到嗰條線你都仲係覺得搏唔過。

169
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:56,200
唔好三跑落城，都係用呢個系統。你要即刻換噉，你換你又要招標，又要評標，又要培訓，又要測試，又搞你五年啦。我唔知啊，二零二三減五年嘅二零一八，你仲係一年領嘅啫。即係話其實睇副樣咧，你年領搞唔掂啲套嘢咧。

170
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:16,210
你就要學新德利噉樣樣放棄重頭招標。我想問下你，你哋心目中有冇呢條噉嘅死線？二零一八年，梗係你畀時間。誒，主席誒，我以為今日係講三跑，因為我知道咧就誒立法會經濟發展專務委員會咧喺喺下個禮拜十三號會咧。

171
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:55,670
喺全球所有大嘅機場咧，當佢啲航管系統或者空管系統喺個系統嘅轉換過程裏邊咧，開始都係有啲誒各樣嘅磨合問題嘅，或者英文啊teething problems係有嘅。而家有啲譬如話誒啲航機啊喺熒幕上個分身啊或者啲鬼影。

172
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,310
講咧就誒，我哋會繼續係同民航處嘅同事咧，就保持誒密切嘅聯絡。

173
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:33,240
睇到將來三跑系統，即係個操作咧噉樣，即係如果有嘅話，即係你哋翻嚟嘅信息係點樣？

174
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:39,070
房署啊嘛，如果你係跟住三，誒從我個角度，梗係問機管局啦。如果唔係，我下次冇機會問機管局。

175
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:51,030
誒初期誒即係面對一啲小問題，咁咧就遲啲。當然問題解決之後咧，就誒嗰個空管系統就能夠發揮佢應有嘅嗰個效用。

176
00:40:50,240 --> 00:41:01,550
即係除咗信心之外，你哋覺得佢嘅問題係咪影響到安全問題，還是呢啲問題喺一個新系統即係使用過程中嘅必然嘅一個過程咧？噉樣嚇。

177
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:49,960
系統操作嘅過程，你哋應該都有頭先聽阿總裁講，你哋有了解啦。噉你哋覺得從你嘅專業判斷咧，睇翻呢個新嘅控制系統，你哋誒嗰個？

178
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:12,080
係咪呢個誒，即係新嘅空管系統對成個即係春節或者呢個聖誕節會唔會帶嚟影響咧？佢有嘅話，最壞嘅情況去到咩嘢嘢，你哋冇評估咧？啊，如果當啲情況發生嘅時候，你哋有冇啲即係備用嘅誒措施嘅咧？嚇？

179
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:15,680
啊！有啲誒一啲某啲嘅誒資訊係顯示唔係即時顯示到咧。其實呢個咧喺過去即係舊嘅航管系統都有發生嘅。主席對唔住，我剩翻三十秒。誒，局長唔好意思，我嘅問題其實係話你係咪即係話你同處長傾過佢係包山仔，認為我會唔會？

180
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:46,360
主席，誒，即係我所講咧，可能阿田議員最好就係個經濟發展事務委員會問主張就呢個新系統嘅表現。誒，主張畀到我哋睇咧，就係新系統係不存在呢個系統安全問題。啊，亦都咧，我覺得咧，我係好，我係好難咧，就一啲即係即係HSA嘅英文所講，一聽翻嚟係點，因為咁唔係好。

181
00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:14,150
誒周鼎議員係喺十一月三十號有封信畀經濟發展事務委員會，亦都誒啊林建峯主席亦都接納咗封信咧，就會喺十二月十三號誒經濟事務發展誒經濟發展事務委員會個panel嗰度咧誒傾呢個問題。

182
00:37:45,550 --> 00:38:05,560
誒最近咧，誒我都係問翻呢個空管嘅問題啊！即係大家知道都誒陸續續出現一啲大家即係公眾關注嘅新空管嘅問題啦。噉我就唔知道咧，即係誒機管局方面咧有冇咧就最近發生嘅問題咧主動。

183
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:25,570
同呢個誒當局或者銀行處咧，瞭解即係成個系統將來會唔會因為佢系統路做出出現問題，影響到咧？即係當誒三百系統啟用之後咧，即係大量嘅航機會誒增加㗎嘛？係咪？咁嗰個情況之下咧，會唔會影響？

184
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:53,530
誒第二個問題咧，就係想問，即係誒大家知啦，聖誕誒春節都嚟啦，啊咁誒三跑系統誒未開啫，但係誒我哋聖聖誕春節我哋都要面臨嗰個誒嗰個加班嘅問題啦。咁誒，你哋有冇評估嗰個三跑系統？

185
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:32,450
長誒，我估姚院想問機管局。好誒誒，林總裁誒，主席好多謝姚院呢個問題。誒，我哋自從新嘅嗰個空管系統誒啟用之後咧，誒，我哋當然同誒民航處誒嘅同事都有一個好緊密嘅聯繫誒。

186
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:52,460
誒到依家嚟講咧，就依個系統係對我哋機場本身嘅運作係冇乜影響。誒，我哋亦都好有信心。誒，就民航處嘅依個新嘅系統咧，就會令到我哋將來咧能夠處理更加多嘅航班嘅升降。誒，咁嚟緊誒聖誕誒呢段時間咧，我哋當然會好似過往噉。

187
00:39:52,570 --> 00:40:12,580
係會係增加一啲新嘅班次，咁呢方面咧，我哋已經同誒民航處咧就溝通好，我哋好有信心咧，就響嚟緊嘅依個誒聖誕假期咧，就依個新嘅空管系統係可以處理到誒，我哋依家需要增加嘅新嘅嗰啲班次，咁喺呢方面嚟講。

188
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:38,600
係，嗯，有冇跟進？啊，主席，誒，即係誒機管局本身都係好多專家啦，係咪？你哋本身亦對成個機場嘅誒運作都好清楚。咁誒，以往你哋都可能同呢個舊嘅原來嘅空管系統都都明白佢操作嘅。咁新嘅空管。

189
00:46:49,980 --> 00:47:02,250
邊咧就分隔落去？我想問下咧，阿主席，我想通過你問一問咧，如果你有嗱，我而家攞住你個modification letter，你而家就話要有exhibition and convention centres，我想問下隔離就係AWE啦。

190
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:34,600
用一千蚊可以換二百億，真係抵到爛啊！主席，我真係唔知邊度嚟嘅。同埋，我好想問下咧，咁機管局覺得自己係咪係咪做緊，即係係咪做緊正業啊？我想嗱，我手樓上除咗有呢啲地契之外咧，我仲有咩咧？

191
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:10,270
冇咧，都係要同機場有關嘅。但係而家個北商業區咧，如果根據政府嘅公告講乜嘢啊，要將呢個北商業區咧發展成為香港首個零售、餐飲同埋娛樂匯聚嘅專區，成為獨當一面嘅旅遊點。

192
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:29,400
機場我嚟做旅遊點嘅咩？主席，我真係唔知咯，我真係識嘢少咯。唔好意思，我真係想麻煩機管局答下咧。你而家係咪冒緊正業啊？商機場變商場，本來機場嘅用地變商場，我想問下家珍係究竟你要做景點，好似迪士尼噉樣啊，定係你係想真係好好地去搞機場咧？唔該，主席。

193
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:21,850
嗯，林主席，嗱，當然啦。誒，我哋機管局誒同民航處響呢方面嘅專業係唔同嘅。咁誒，民航處就對去佢哋先至係誒依一個誒空管系統嘅專家啦。噉我哋機管局本身嘅專業就響機場本身嘅嗰個管理咧，誒。

194
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:41,860
不過誒，當然我哋同誒民航處嘅同事就喺誒平常嘅工作上面係保持好誒緊密嘅嘅聯繫。噉我哋對於誒民航處誒同事喺呢方面嘅專業嘅能力係好有信心。我哋相信嚟講咧，誒依家佢哋面對嘅嗰啲問題，只係系統。

195
00:41:51,320 --> 00:42:11,330
啊！我建議大家咧，對於個空管系統嘅問題咧，係喺十三號嘅誒經濟發展panel裏面去跟進比較好啲，因為今日在座嘅官員咧，同埋機管嘅同事咧，可能對呢方面嗰個誒為大家解釋嘅問題咧。

196
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:31,340
係未夠深入嘅。咁今日我哋誒三跑小組咧，主要就就工程同財務方面嘅問題咧，我哋多啲關注下，好唔好啊？下一位，阿主席啊，因為咧，即係下一次嘅會議，可能機管局唔知有冇派人嚟度誒嚟參加嘅咧？誒，或者淨係誒，即係到時就嗰個係銀行。

197
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:59,810
好嘅，下誒下一位陳續章議員。多謝主席。當然啦，今次機場三跑咧要用呢一個誒千幾億咧，一五一四億啊嘛，一萬一四一五億。一四一五。我哋當然係非常之關注，特別係佢嘅財務安排。今日政府咧就非常之手鬆，亦都好爽快啊！

198
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:19,820
誒第一樣嘢噉啊，就唔再收呢一個花紅住啦，至少十年嘅噉啊，最好真係安安全全搞得掂佢啦。因為咧每一年嘅花紅都唔少嘅，大家睇年報就知啊。咁原來咧政府唔單止送佢花紅，原來仲要送佢地啊，主席好厲害啊！如果大家有留意嘅話咧，最近咧有一個叫做北商業。

199
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:39,830
區啊，一千蚊就嗱，我個手攞上揸住個地契，就係原本嗰個地契，同埋一個叫modification letter啊。睇緊係啦，呢個modification letter咧，係九月十四號簽嘅，但係政府當局係九月二十三號咧先至發出新聞稿，當中係涉及六十萬平方米嘅土地。

200
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:59,840
六十萬平方米嘅土地咧，講緊我當你簡單啲講，當六百萬平方尺。阿主席，誒郭家麒議員咧之前咧曾經問過一條問題，佢都有引述翻咧，用二零一三年東湧第三A商業區用地咧五十四萬平方尺嘅地方係賣咗二十三億嘅超。

201
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:19,850
超過噉，如果而家我哋講緊係六百萬平方尺，係超過十倍，係咪真係講緊咧？係超過二百億嘅嘅現金。而家政府係大嗱嗱，送咗二百億嘅錢啊！我而家講緊係已經二零一三年送咗二百億畀機管局。我想問下用？

202
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:55,350
我就有呢一個機管局條例啊。機管局啊，主席已經好清楚啦，係法定組織啦，係嘛？第五條啊，講緊機管局嘅宗旨啊，係做一啲咧係營運發展同埋維持一個咧位於赤鱲角或者其他附近民航機場啦，又或者係其他地方，但係講緊你嘅職。

203
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,470
離譜嘅。

204
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,270
誒，我哋依家。

205
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,090
唔使入港嘅意味做咩？啊位誒，郭家麒。

206
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,170
我再問一次，政府點解唔係收足地價？

207
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,790
誒，主席，長啊，機管局係公營企業啊，還是阿林天福私營啊？

208
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,360
因為你諗下東匯城同你差唔多嘅啫，用你呢一個睇法，東匯城啲收益你應該收埋。

209
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:36,540
公堂嘅利益應該收足地價。如果頭先同阿林天福嘅睇法，不如成個東湧劃埋係你啦。

210
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:15,010
將啲錢畀翻公堂，係咪將佢係成為機管局個遮醜報案嚟起三跑局長達？

211
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:05,070
誒，似乎你未答國議員所問，機管局而家嗰度係咪等於同東匯食喎？

212
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:03,450
嗰條跑道起完之後飛唔飛到？到而家一張紙都冇，所謂嘅協定到而家一張紙都冇，噉就夾硬嚟。

213
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:29,910
如果嗰笪地個地價係值咁多嘅，任何商業機構咧，政府都作為即係為維護我哋嘅。

214
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:54,920
因為呢個地係希望同政府填用用呢沓地去填而家個氹一千四百十五億已經本身係離曬大普。

215
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:20,840
主席，我翻翻你呢個問題，其實政府咧係絕對咧係偷換概念，同埋係有少少叫狼狽為奸，係想揾呢啲方法遮醜。

216
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:57,150
佢咧亦都係一個所謂名義嘅nominal value，噉佢畀咗機管局嘅嚇。當然即係話議員會關心，噉係咪等於會有利益上嘅問題？其實機管局咧，佢所有嘅收入咧，其實都係即係最終都係屬於政府嘅資產嚟嘅。

217
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:49,950
嗯，局長或者林主席，我講幾句先好啊。林天福總裁，局長唔該。嗱，首先咧就係呢個北區要作發展咧，唔係近期先講嘅。誒，喺如果冇記錯咧，二零一三年行政長官施政報告都提過㗎啦。佢嗰個誒構思咧，同而家三跑道系統。

218
00:45:49,950 --> 00:46:09,960
係兩回事，財政上亦都唔會混淆。咁當然咧，誒，剛才阿陳議員問到，即係話究竟依個北西區嘅發展同機場冇關係，我哋從政府角度咧認為係絕對有關係嘅，因為依個令到我哋機場咧能夠發揮最大嘅一個協同效應喺全球其他大機場咧，其實。

219
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:29,970
都有SkyCity噉樣嘅概念嘅，係依個促成個機場佢本身嗰個先有地位。但係進一步關於嗰個誒北商業區嘅發展嘅構思或者內容同個機場即係關係，我畀阿林總裁講講啦。係阿林總裁，好多謝主席。誒，首先我要澄清一點咧，就係嗰個北商業區嗰塊地原本已經係屬於。

220
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:49,980
機場所有噉，今次嘅依個誒政府咧，就誒所謂modification，只係將原本屬於我哋塊地嘅個年期咧，就加長二十年。如果我問你，你同唔同意佢係畀多咗樓面面積，你哋可以可發展嘅樓面面面積，係咪你唔同同意啊？誒，依個都係由我哋原本機場嘅一啲樓面面積。

221
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:22,950
噉你又同佢爭生意啊？A W E仲有三十四萬平方米未起，如果我冇記錯嘅話，噉你同佢一齊起啊，同佢聯合啊，定係你諗住食埋佢嗰啲咧？呢個只不過係地契上有時寫得闊啲，可以容許多啲唔同嘅一啲商業活動可以舉行。即係寫得闊啲之後，你可以再做呢一個誒餐飲零售業。

222
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:42,960
噉樣咯，喎係嘛？誒，亦都噉樣講嘅，因為咧，就好似正如頭先局長所講，全世界咧就有好多地方咧都有發展所謂嘅airport city。咁依個咧先能夠充分利用到我哋將來三跑起完之後其實帶嚟嗰啲誒人流啦，同埋物流。而家要做景點，勁過迪迪尼。

223
00:47:46,460 --> 00:48:06,470
誒繼續答埋。哦，各位各位，咁其實依家咧，我哋係好希望咧，將來發展咧，只係能夠喺機場嘅範圍入邊咧，能夠係有個新嘅一個誒集咗誒一啲誒商業啦嘅元素。將來嚟講咧，更加能夠充分利用到機場帶嚟嘅嗰啲經。

224
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,740
誒唔會超支嘅。

225
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,350
不再問都冇意思，我想問一個問題。

226
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:41,690
仲有冇問題跟住？唔係佢嗰個合約點樣可以確保唔超支啊？

227
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:20,540
將來嗰個收益係咪能夠填呢個氹？我哋估計都係凍過水。

228
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,590
咁而家政府就要揾一啲遮醜布，咁呢個北商業區咪將佢做遮醜咯。

229
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:56,920
而家第二行樓咧就要拆咗佢，基本上已經係一個當時規劃上嗰個極大嘅錯誤。

230
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:49,950
而家政府硬硬嚟起呢個三跑，其中一樣嘢最離譜嘅咧，就話要改善嗰個機場個服務。

231
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:21,510
條例咧，機管局可以收費用嘅，誒，按照佢營運嘅機場所需要。咁分紅咧，佢係可以收。分紅咧。分紅好似任何嘅機構一樣。

232
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:15,010
咁梗唔係，都會成另外一樣嘢。唔係，即係主席，你覺得即係而家根本政府係離曬譜，因為事實上而家千四億咧係一個大氹嚟嘅。

233
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:32,870
咁而家話啲一千四百十五億用政府歷年啊，尤其呢幾年嗰啲超支嗰個嗰個記錄咧，千四億多數賣唔到單，分中千八千九都唔知。

234
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:32,500
你可唔可以將嗰個合約而家畀我哋睇一睇？你同而家個填海個工程同埋一啲初步基建工程點樣捍衞我哋嘅利益啊？到時又係再爆煲，又要我哋揾公堂嚟填氹填呢個氹係咪？

235
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:36,620
佢係由機管局嘅董事局去決定係咪派息，噉我哋過去都解釋過啦。機管局佢運用佢內部資金作進一步投資，所以唔派息就得㗎啦。將來機場嘅營運咧帶嚟更大收益嘅，依個符合商業原則嘅。

236
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:41,150
誒主席，機管局係政府全資擁有，但係按照機管局條例咧，佢係要絕對咧要恪守恪守嗰個商業審慎商業嘅經營嘅原則嘅。明白。就機場島嘅地咧，好似剛才阿林天福總裁所講咧，其實都係畀咗機管局嘅。咁而過。

237
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:17,210
未起三炮之前，而家拆嗰第二航樓，將來亂曬大龍個情況點算？呢個第一，第二冇立法會嘅准許，繞過立法會已經籤咗約啦。噉啊，政府就好叻嘅。之前就話搞一大輪發展局，就話用一啲方法令到嗰啲工程唔超標，唔會招。

238
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:52,790
啊，局長。誒，主席，誒，政府過去都誒多番重申啊，呢個工程咧，政府係唔會誒提供任何即係話進一步嘅擔保或者點樣嘅。機管局佢而家定嗰個財政安排咧，佢係可以透過本身嘅內部資金啦，佢一啲嘅收費啦，同埋佢向市場借貸借貸。

239
00:51:52,790 --> 00:52:12,800
咧係可以應付得到嘅，局長，你唔收嗰個分分紅同埋加嗰個税，基本上係喺我哋嗰啲納税人同埋普通市民攞錢嘅。你唔好話嗰啲錢唔係屬於公帑，呢個係唔到嘅。誒，咁依個視乎一個議員佢點去界定個公帑個個範圍啦。因為按照依個機場管理局。

240
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,520
多謝主席。

241
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,330
有冇任何責任㗎咧？政府。

242
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:58,960
咁喺機管局董事局裏邊，亦都係有政府代表啦，亦都係機管局嘅董事咧，亦都係由政府委任。

243
00:56:52,830 --> 00:57:04,190
再產生責任咧，呢個當然政府一定要負嘅。但我以為剛才鄭議員所關心嘅咧，就係財務上安排喺財務安排方面咧。過去我講過，林天福總裁講過，唔存在政府包底。

244
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:31,820
誒，萬一喺嗰個融資，即係可能失敗面對財赤嘅情況噉，咁需唔需要由政府包底咧？會唔會喺而家個條款裏面考慮係加入一啲係即係政府係唔會包底嘅講法咧？

245
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:51,820
放曬手唔理機管局，但係的確咧喺機場誒管理局條例底下咧，機管局佢係會誒有佢營運上嘅自主性，但係佢都係要確保咧係遵守到呢個審慎商業嘅原則嘅。

246
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:55,260
佢講，噉我想就住咧係關於融資個方面問一問嘅，就係如果而家講緊嘅就係話誒第三跑道啦，噉就要係即係有個融資嘅方案啊噉，咁誒運房局啊或者政府喺當中嘅角色係有啲咩嘅責任咧？

247
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:18,780
我哋當然就響好幾方面咧，就係會希望令儘量令到呢方面嘅嗰個風險減到最低。如果有時間嘅話咧，我好樂意請我哋嘅三跑嘅嗰個總監向大家解釋嘅。啊，下一位鄭崇泰儀。

248
00:52:42,080 --> 00:53:02,090
阿總裁點答嘅有個合約咧？合約點樣確保唔超支？可唔可以攞個合約個範本畀我？我當然啦，我哋嘅合約係屬於我哋嘅商業秘密啦。亦都呢個咧就將來我哋仲有好多新嘅合約就要推出。響呢個時候咧，就如果將合約攞出嚟嘅話，對我哋將來本身再批新合約，當然會有好大影響啦。咁咪點樣確保唔超支啊？

249
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:40,870
誒，我啱聽到局長佢所講咧，即係嗰個關於而家機場第三跑道嗰個嘅建造過程裏面咧，即係感覺上畀人哋好似攞住呢一個嘅誒機管局條例，就好似變成一個獨立王國去處理嘅話，我覺得呢樣嘢係即係喺嗰個政府嗰方面咧，係冇可能噉樣嘅去。

250
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:17,650
局長誒，主席喺我開場發言都講咗。首先喺政府最高層，由財政司司長佢主持一個誒三法系統嘅一個督導委員會。咁依個咧就少少似當年喺九上世紀九十年代新機場嗰個督導委員會，當時由政務司司長主持嘅。咁呢個督導委員會。

251
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:37,660
佢就會整體上去誒監察同埋去統籌。另外咧，就喺誒運服局裏邊咧，亦都成立咗一個有關於呢個機場擴建嘅統籌辦公室。噉佢都係會睇實呢個三跑道系統嘅工程，即係包括佢啲誒財務嘅安排嘅。咁所以政府唔會話咧係。

252
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:19,250
主席，主席，我我希望咧，即係局方同埋即係建管局都明白到嘅就係香港大眾喺呢一個，尤其即係而家集中喺個財政同埋嗰個嘅融資部分咧，感覺上嘅就係即係一張白紙啦，同埋又或者有一個唔好聽嘅講法嚟講一個黑箱在嘅情況底下，大家都唔明白，都唔清楚嗰個當中一啲嘅條款。譬如舉例嘅就係。

253
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:52,440
獎誒，政府從來冇打算包底嘅，而機構唔係即係會唔會喺個條款裏面淨寫到明係話政府唔會包底咧？有基金局自己自負盈虧喺呢方面。我哋公開都講過，呢啲係白紙黑字有記錄嘅。好，喺基金局可以講講佢哋嘅對而家嗰個成本嘅嘅評估。即即係換言之，如果噉嘅講法嘅話，最尾就係香港市民買單嘅咯。

254
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:06,790
誒。

255
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,950
多謝主席。

256
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,250
下一位，盧偉國議員。

257
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,250
嗰度地方嘅海牀咧，又相當複雜。

258
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:38,220
當複雜，所以我想問咧，就而家所講嘅實驗係成功咧？誒，究竟係？

259
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:14,290
各方有冇係關於嗰個融資嗰個具體嘅時間畀我做安排？可以畀大眾清楚係見到嘅。純粹係財務方面融資嘅風險，或者林天福總裁呢個。係嘅，林總裁。

260
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:28,650
誒，我哋誒響誒今年誒年初嘅時候，向立法會誒嗰個交代嗰個財務安排入邊咧，係冇打算將來需要政府誒承擔任何財務上嘅責任嘅。

261
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:48,960
主席，今次呢個機場三跑嘅工程咧，牽涉到都相當大範圍嘅填海，噉啊，今日咧都比較高興咧，就誒睇到今日喺嗰個報告裏邊咧，對於。

262
00:58:49,240 --> 00:59:05,210
誒，所用用嘅環保嘅填海嘅技術，即係話深層水泥盤合法咧，就係話咧係經過一啲嘅測試同埋誒監察之下嘅試驗咧，個結果咧都係成功嘅。

263
00:55:52,800 --> 00:56:12,810
誒主席，如果政府包括局長或者其他嘅官員喺立法會裏邊公開地講嘅，都唔夠保證。我唔知咩叫個保證。唔係嗱，因為呢度咧，我我我明白到今日會別會議唔係討論嗰個即係新系統嘅管制啦。但係我想就呢一點咧，啱啱頭先局長所講咧，引生出個問題可以。

264
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:32,820
好大，即係而家興建咗之後嘅話，噉你話哦嗰個條款裏面唔會寫政府有任何嘅公帑或者嗰個保險上嘅一啲嘅嘅嘅嘅相關條款啦。咁萬一空缺嘅問題，再加埋新系統嘅問題，係引致到喺第三跑道喺嗰度出現一啲即係空難又好啊！

265
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:52,830
或者即係Touchwood講係一啲人人事嘅傷亡咁喺呢度，嗰一刻政府係冇任何嘅責任係需要負上嘅。我我估通機管局賠曬咩？嗰一刻我估鄭宇仁混淆咗嘅概念。如果機場出現一啲問題，係由於政府作為呢個民航監管者，即係民航處佢作為空管嘅嗰度。

266
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:24,670
啊！我我相信，我相信呢個係大眾市民運鬧，因為你本身基管局又加埋，即係運房局，你自己係一個人帶幾多任務啦？喺呢個噉嘅條例底下，咁但係你係説服唔到嘅就係話，當呢一個第三跑道係你用一個噉嘅方法去營運去運作嘅話，萬一遇到我頭先所講嘅，就係話喺建築以至到係營運嘅過程裡面，面

267
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:44,680
面對住呢啲問題，噉你當中嘅融資你必然會考慮嘅，作為政府一方。誒，我想問問啊，謝議員誒，你係講財務融資方面嘅問題咧，還是出現困難啊，或者人命？頭先係提出嚟。誒，主席，主席，主席，呢樣嘢唔能夠完全劃分嘅。你嗰個財務融資嘅時候，就必必然考慮到風險㗎啦，作為一

268
00:57:44,680 --> 00:58:04,690
間公司係嘛嗱財務融資嘅風險就銀紙方面問題嘅，但係空難同埋人命損失就另外一件事。咁咁都係咁都係風險嘅考慮之一嚟咯。所以局長你冇可能喺當中嘅就係即係，所以我好簡單嘅啫，好簡單啫。你問清咗一個問題，我好簡單啫，主席得啦，你你好簡單啫。咁喺呢一個範疇上面。

269
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:30,600
而家所講嘅深層水泥半合法咧，就就係話誒嗰啲污泥坑嗰啲地方咧，係用呢個方式嚟講咧，就係比較即係好一啲。誒，另外你亦都有係非污泥坑範圍咧，就用傳統嘅疏水排誒填海法噉。咁所以其實呢個整個填海工程咧，都係相當。

270
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:43,850
嘅。

271
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:45,840
啊。

272
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:53,830
係噉，好嘅，下一位誒副主席阿譚文豪議員。

273
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:42,250
個計算係幾多錢一粒粟米嘅？當其時你估算係唔該，主席。誒，邊個答啊？請機管局嘅同事。

274
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:08,350
reviews of all our designs. So we're very very confident that this technique will work, and again the trials have shown that it will be successful.

275
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:58,600
係所講嘅係成功係以邊方面嘅論述，係咪是否咧包括埋評估第日咧喺嗰個填海之後，誒嗰個沉降嘅情況咧都係掌握控制到嘅？因為咧正正喺文卷裏邊提到咧就話，深層水泥拌合法嘅例子係包。

276
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:18,610
包括大阪關西機場噉，但係據知咧，大阪關西機場咧都係，如果啲沉降方面咧係誒比預期嚴重誒嘅情形，即係話喺個運作之後咧就變咗嗰度咧都係有一定嘅影響。咁所以喺呢一方面咧係工程業界。

277
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:38,620
係都有啲朋友咧，就提出一啲誒呢一方面嘅又要慎重嘅地方，所以我覺得係喺今日咧，正好係既然有誒技術嘅人員係代表喺度咧，都可以同我哋解釋一下啊，究竟嗰個誒保證咧究竟有幾強啊？照目前誒做到嘅情況，或者。

278
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:58,630
先答呢部分先，好嘛？技術上問題係咪啊？潘家宏先誒答咩？Thank you for the question. Um, you're right. Um, DCM is um first time being used in Hong Kong, but it is being extensively used around Asia and around the world. Um, we did conduct two sets of trials. The first trial was several years ago, was primarily to to make sure

279
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:18,640
That the DCM technique could be used without creating any environmental impact, and we were pleased as part of the Ia to confirm that. The second set of trials we did last year and this year were more extensive. They were looking very much at the engineering aspects. We used different types of plant, three different types of DCM plant that all will be used.

280
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:38,650
in the in in the current reclamation, we carried out very many different types of clusters. We put in hundreds of different clusters where we use different cement contents to experiment with the the engineering properties. We're very pleased to report that all of the trials we did and all the the very careful instrumentation we

281
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:58,660
They were all very successful. In fact, the strength gains in the in the clays around, and they were all done in the hardest mud pit to construct. All very very successful. You rightly mentioned that there was some concern where DCM was used at Kansai. Perhaps I can clarify here that.

282
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:18,670
The much understood early problems with the original Kansai Airport, they didn't use DCM, and in fact those were problems with the very very thick muds. Their muds are 90, 100 metres thick. Ours are only 15 metres. In fact, the DCM use in Kansai was actually done in the second phase, which which didn't have the same settlement problems.

283
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:38,680
That the the earlier problems had. So again, we're very confident this technique. Having done some extensive trials in Hong Kong, also we've in the design of it, we've been very very careful. We've also involved international experts to advise separately to do a peer review of our design.

284
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:58,690
And of course, we've had a lot of cooperation from government departments, GEO, Port Works, CDD, and of course our own buildings department. Again, scrutinising and reviewing the designs. Indeed, Government APO, the Airport Coordination Office, have also conducted with their own consultant.

285
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,220
係喺大陸運入嚟香港。

286
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:26,460
誒，可唔可以答覆佢咧？嗱，我等機管局講講嚇。係，我相信。

287
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:17,620
而你講緊咧過往咧，佢當年做個報告喺二零一四年啦，當其時海砂價格大約四十蚊，係每一立方米。

288
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:27,550
海砂嘅價格咧，曾經係上過去百幾蚊嘅。咁所以頭先講過啦，你一億一億立方米咧，你講緊個數可以由幾十億變咗去一百億嘅。

289
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:18,750
The cost of sand per cubic metre depends on timing. Are all within comfortably within our original estimates? So the the sand has been by having.

290
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:25,390
噉我而家問翻佢，當日喺二零一四年佢交呢一個報告話一千四百一十五億嘅時候，佢如何計算呢一個嘅海沙嘅比重？

291
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:20,740
誒，長可唔可以將統計處嘅資料話畀啊副主席？當當然唔係，啊主席唔好意思，我我統計處唔需要，我網上我自己都揾到。我要嘅係佢究竟用乜嘢嘅價格嚟到計算，擺落呢一千四百一十五億裏邊。

292
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:12,710
唔係問你而家個標書幾多錢啊？我係問你當日你計算一千四百一十五億嘅時候，你嘅海沙係用乜嘢嘅價格？呢一個係完全影響到究竟會唔會超支啊嘛！如果我哋開呢個會嚟做咩啊？主席係咪？

293
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:35,310
conducted a tender exercise using quite a lot of competition. We managed to get the sand prices.唔好唔好意思，主席，我我必須停一停。我問緊你當期時估算一千四百十五億嘅時候，你嘅海沙當期時嘅估算係幾多錢一立方？誒一立方米？

294
01:06:45,930 --> 01:07:05,140
主席，我我亦都唔同意，因為個投標已經完成咗㗎啦。個投標係已經完成咗，呢個第一。第二咧，你所講嘅海砂價錢咧，其實喺統計處上面咧已經係有㗎啦。咁所以我唔知點解會咁神秘。我問你當日點樣計算一千四百一零一，你不能夠答我當日你計算海砂嘅價錢。

295
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:47,280
咁所以我點解我好想知道究竟而家個差別幾多？嗱，頭先講過就係話，而家你哋個標書個價格係低於當年即係佢哋預算嗰個數啦。咁當然我好多謝佢咁講啦，我都唔使咁驚啦。咁但係有顯身啦，就係話，如果佢當日一千四百一十五億，原來係崩大咗條數嘅。

296
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:29,010
啊！主席，然後誒誒聽到呢個誒解釋，就我相信就我哋工程業界嘅朋友都會好有興趣瞭解多一啲，所以我都會建議咧，係咪機管局誒技術部門咧都考慮同，譬如話同誒香港工程師會相關嘅分部咧，就搞一啲誒技術。

297
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:49,020
嘅研討會，噉啊將佢誒一啲嘅設計上嘅構想誒，同埋呢個具體試驗嘅情況啊，同埋其他啲機場嘅誒經驗嘅數據咧，可以作一個誒大家嘅分享，咁亦都可以咧係集思廣益啊，一個建議多謝。啊，局長同總裁聽到呢個意見啊嚇。

298
01:03:54,470 --> 01:04:14,480
多謝主席。誒，雖然咧我咧就係誒喺航空公司工作啦，但係我陣間問嘅問題咧就關於一個工程嘅問題嘅。噉我想咧想問咧，嗱，你成個工程嘅費用咧就一千四百一十五億啦。咁而當中咧其實係大約五百六十億咧都係擺咗喺填海嗰部分嘅使咗喺，咁而。

299
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:34,490
沿海咧，其中有一樣嘢就係誒非常之重要嘅物料咧。其實就係沙海沙啊，講緊噉。而你要用幾多咧？我文件上面講咧就一億立方米，一億立方米。噉我就想誒，締發個問題咧，就係話誒，你哋當日估算一千四百十五億嘅時候，你呢一億立方米你？

300
01:04:46,480 --> 01:05:06,490
Sorry, just catching the interpretation. Yes, the during the design and establishment of the budget, we very carefully took market sounding on the cost of sand. It is variable and has changed over time. I'm very pleased to report that in the recent tenders that we have awarded.

301
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:27,590
佢哋咪。

302
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,450
係誒安排嘅。

303
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,450
第三就係北商業區。

304
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,430
第五個問題咧，就係誒。

305
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:55,990
嘅收入，政府有冇分紅嘅？

306
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:37,400
唔該，主席。誒六條問題，麻煩你誒逐家回答。第一就係想請問嗰個融資安排嗰度咧，係用乜嘢做擔保嘅？

307
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:23,860
誒請告知本會就係嗰個分利潤咧，究竟係分係誒net profit啦、gross profit啦，定話係turnover咧噉樣？

308
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:48,280
第二咧就係有嗰個擔保部分有冇係包括北商業區作為嗰個借貸六百九十億嘅擔保部分？

309
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:39,780
呢一個招標咧，同財團合資去經營誒興建北新業區咧，有冇經過政府內部公私合營嘅內部守則嘅規定？

310
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:13,630
第四個問題就係從報章見到咧，你哋而家招標咧喺北商業區咧，係會同財團咧係合資興建誒嗰啲設施咧，係會有分利潤嘅安排。

311
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:25,710
連爭幾多percent你都唔願意講嘅時候，即係我同意你話哦，因為你將來會再招標就話啫。但係據我所知，你張標書完成咗係係已經定曬價㗎啦嘛。咁點樣影響你將來再咩咧？你個海砂買曬㗎啦嘛係咪啊？我我想問一問追問係咪買曬㗎啦海砂已經呢張呢張標書唔該。

312
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:56,620
我唔知依個會唔會係，因為點解我哋全部投標嘅，有啲我哋成本細節係唔適宜公開講嘅，嚇會影響到個投標嗰啲利益。啊，主席，主席，我必須要講點解我提出呢個問題咧？因為其實喺我今年嘅五月咧，其實我寫咗信畀機管局嘅，我就係問佢，其實我唔。

313
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:45,930
我我相信我呢個問題好合理嘅。誒，主席會有個財務影響嘅啊。因為當然咧，最最恰當係經管局去講講嘅詳細情況。因為點解咧？如果你話畀市場聽，我喺我預算裏邊預咗幾多錢某一個誒項目嘅話咧，投標者就會用盡你預咗筆錢啊。所以嗰度係一個相信敏感嘅。

314
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:46,870
男議員最關心嘅就係話誒，究竟依家我哋投標翻嚟嘅價格係咪超超出咗當時嘅預算啊？咁頭先我同事已經誒講咗，實際上我哋投標翻嚟嘅價係低過當時我哋嗰個預算嘅嗰個誒價錢。咁再用呢方面嚟講，多謝林生，可唔可以講講大約會翻幾多個？

315
01:07:46,870 --> 01:08:06,880
percentage，我諗依個又好似頭先我講誒，都會有一定程度影響我哋將來嘅投標嘅嗰個策略啦。噉我我只能夠講話咧，就誒依家我哋投標翻嚟嘅價錢係誒，響我哋預算嘅範圍入邊。我我點解要要問咧？嗱，第一咧，所有嘅海沙咧，據我所知咧，全部都係。

316
01:08:47,680 --> 01:09:07,690
係估算超過咗嘅多好多嘅，咁其實亦都係成個你成個即係究竟最尾埋單幾多錢係好重要一個指標嚟㗎嘛？噉我先睇到緊會唔會即係另外一種諗法，會唔會當日你係煲大嗰條數，其實就唔使咁多錢嘅，噉你而家慳翻啲咧就撥去其他位，我唔知啊，因為我你連你。

317
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:46,670
總裁係咪買曬嘅？嗱，當然咧就誒，我哋啲合約嗰啲合同咧就本身好複雜，入邊涉及嘅唔係單止淨係一個沙嘅價錢，咁所以喺呢方面嚟講咧，我都覺得如果大家容許嘅話咧，呢個係我哋將來整個三跑項誒項目管理重要一部分噉。

318
01:09:46,670 --> 01:10:06,680
如果我哋依個時候咧就講太多有關合約入邊嘅一啲細節嘅話咧，我覺得係會影響到將來我哋本身批其他合約嘅一啲情況。我亦都可以響度同大家講，當年我哋做個預算嘅時候，除咗我哋自己經過有專業嘅一啲誒核數師做之外，其實政府亦都係揾咗獨立。

319
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:34,760
佢個行入邊。

320
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,250
啊，林總裁。

321
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,660
下一位誒朱愛迪兒。

322
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,850
邊個出嗰個建造成本啊？

323
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:45,620
總裁講講，但係點都好，所有收益入翻機管局，呢個機管局嘅所有資產都係政府嘅。

324
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:10,160
將來咧係可以咧提供一個誒更加即係適合將來經常發展嘅一個誒項目。

325
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:21,960
實際上，誒將來嚟講咧，就唔準備係誒一次性咧，就係誒要求嗰個財團咧，就向我哋繳付個租金。咁將來咧，我哋會以咧就係誒未來咁多年咧，同佢誒。

326
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:46,130
所以其實我哋預計入邊，我哋之前都講過嗰三個誒將來誒用嚟誒即係支持三跑發展嘅三個方案入邊咧，就唔包括NCD本身嘅收入。誒，正如頭先局長所講，誒NCD係屬於我哋機管局嘅。

327
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:26,690
嘅一啲嘅誒税基人嚟幫我哋核算嗰條數，所以條數入邊絕對係冇誒將佢係誇大，噉係以當時最合理嘅一個預算估算嚟誒制定嗰個合約嘅，喺嗰個誒合誒嗰個項目嘅嗰個預算嘅。O.K. 下一位誒要。

328
01:11:40,180 --> 01:12:00,190
而誒第六咧就係地契條款第三十一條restriction on alienation咧，裏邊係誒不容許係將嗰個土地誒分拆。咁今次嘅分拆究竟係符唔符合第三十一條？唔該。O.K.咁誒，阿局長答問先。嗱，我隻係一。

329
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:20,200
一般性講，啲細節嗰啲等誒基屋局講講，即係具體嗰個同誒出去招標嗰啲嘢。喺政府整個過程，即係話咧，將而家北區所涵蓋嘅地方係誒延長嗰個誒年期啊等等相關嘅嘢咧，全部都係經過。

330
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:40,210
咗政府嘅地政部門、政府嘅律政司係確保係完全符合晒關嘅規定嘅，亦都係最後咧，當然亦都係依啲噉嘅，亦都係經過行政會議去審議啦嚇。咁所以有關嘅程序係完全係遵守嘅。誒，具體將來基建局點樣去去用嘅地方，一定等林。

331
01:12:47,720 --> 01:13:07,730
誒，首先咧就三跑嘅財務財務安排當日誒嗰個匯豐做嘅嗰個誒財務分析入邊咧，係唔需要誒機管局攞任何嘅誒抵押同擔保，因為我哋機管局本身個盈利能力係非常之強，咁所以佢哋相信以我哋本

332
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:27,740
本身嘅嗰個誒credit rating已經可以喺市場度咧，就係誒可以咧就誒融資到足夠嘅嗰個錢。咁喺我哋當初誒做嘅依一個誒整個融資安排，變係並冇將NCD本身嘅收入咧就計算在內。

333
01:13:46,410 --> 01:14:06,420
資產嘅一部分，所以我哋將來喺N C D嘅收入咧，係並係唔會同政府直接有任何嘅嗰個分紅。咁誒，我哋其實今次準備用嘅方式咧，就同政府賣地係有啲分別，因為我哋實際上係唔可以將塊地賣出去，我哋只可以將塊地租出去。噉，所以我哋一

334
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:42,250
分紅嘅，或或者分成嘅形式嚟誒收取我哋應有嘅嗰個誒地價價值。噉我哋未完全決定將來究竟係以佢revenue turnover或者profit嚟做。咁當然啦，其實就嗰個形式上唔同嘅個原則基本上都會係誒一樣㗎啦。咁亦都因為咁咧，因為我依個。

335
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,110
誒，曲長。

336
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,520
算唔算係？

337
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,420
誒包底咧，即係算唔算係唔包底咧？

338
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,520
因為傾呢個開會嘅程序嘅時候咧。

339
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:04,050
個六百九十億嗰個融資方案，畀市民知道咧。

340
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:57,100
資金，噉我哋相信咧，我哋最早可能係要響明年嘅第四季先需要係誒，即係依筆錢。咁所以實際上依個都係好配合依家我哋整個嘅嗰個財務安排。

341
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:12,560
誒主席，噉我想問下林生就係，咁如果你要去到年中先至會有具體嘅方案公佈，咁下次我哋二月七號嗰個會，你有啲咩可以話咗畀我哋聽咧？誒誒，朱議員就。

342
01:17:51,980 --> 01:18:08,460
咁咧，另外就係誒第二個問題咧，想問局長嘅就係一個定義問題嚟嘅，因為我哋都聽好多就話政府係誒唔會包底嘅，噉我就想問，其實唔繼續去收嗰個機管局嘅股息？

343
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:34,620
我係應誒委員嘅要求，要先傾呢個財務問題。得啦，啊主席，得啦，噉我我我明你誒，我驚你。本來就唔係我驚你用咗我啲時間啦，好冇？我補翻畀你啊！嗱，因為咧，本來咧就唔係喺二月份傾嘅。

344
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:51,700
安排就喺，因為嗰陣時候報章係話機管局係諗住年底去講畀市民聽嘛。報章講同而家當局情況講，你聽邊個講咧？噉我諗我就係話，O K，噉你繼續問啦。係啦，噉你畀我補翻時間畀我喎。好。

345
01:14:42,250 --> 01:15:02,260
唔屬於係賣地咧，咁所以當呢方面嚟講咧，我哋實際上只係將塊地租出去畀地產商去發展咧，我哋唔算係同佢係誒合資去係經營呢一個噉嘅地產行，因為我哋都係希望咧能夠揾到一啲咧喺呢方面有經驗嘅一啲誒財團地產商咧，能夠誒為我哋嘅機場咧。

346
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:33,910
因為我哋租塊地出去啦，咁所以當然我哋預計就會由個財團負擔所有其他嘅嗰個收入啦，同埋包括支出啦，啊包括建築成本啦。噉我哋喺呢方面嚟講咧，就冇諗過咧，就我哋當然冇將NCD嘅收入計落去嗰個三炮咧，亦都冇諗過攞錢出嚟咧，再投入去嗰個誒即係北商。

347
01:15:40,000 --> 01:16:00,010
係誒，唔該，主席。咁首先我幾條短問題嚟嘅。第一個問題咧就係誒，因為我哋呢個小組委員會咧，下次開會就係二月七號嘅，噉就嗰個議程咧就係講緊嗰個融資方案。我想問下，而家機管局係幾時會公佈呢個？

348
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:24,780
我哋咧就好似我哋，正如我年初嘅時候講咧，我哋其實準備今年年底之前咧，就會揾一個財務顧問為我哋依六百九十誒億嘅嗰個誒借貸咧，就作誒提供一個報告啦。噉我哋就啱啱上個禮拜咧已經咧就委任咗誒匯豐銀行作。

349
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:44,790
我哋誒嘅依一個誒財務顧問啦，噉我哋估計佢需要誒四至六個月時間嚟完成報告，咁所以我哋咧就誒希望佢哋響誒明年年中之前咧能夠提交依個報告。咁其實個時間上咧係非常之吻合嘅，因為我哋實際上咧亦都無需要太早咧去市場蒐集。

350
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:36,400
誒主席，一般我哋理解包底就話咧，到時使咗錢啊，如果超超過咗預算，總之有爭幾多就政府埋單咁叫包底啦。但係從嗰個機管局佢今次提出去為三跑道系統工程嘅融資咧，佢個策略咧就係一係用呢個。

351
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:52,960
啊！多謝主席。

352
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,420
唔係局長。

353
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,440
補翻時間畀你啊！

354
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,570
啊，其實咧，關於嗰個。

355
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:21,760
誒唔算包底，唔算包底，明白。咁咧就誒。

356
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:50,840
你你係咪補咗啦？補翻啊嘛，你啊已經補咗嘅咯喎。OK，下一位周鼎賢。

357
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:23,820
誒，我想啊，議員想問機管局嚇。啊啊，總裁誒都可以㗎。啊，林生又得，你又得啊。

358
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:12,100
五年嘅報告裏面都有提到一啲情景，某啲情景其實嗰個基金局嘅負債係會去到超過一千億，噉係有咩計劃去還錢嘅咧？

359
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:41,940
響我哋起完誒三跑之後咧，我哋會開始向政府派息。咁但係好似過往噉，我哋都唔係將所有百分之百嘅錢都係向政府派息嘅。噉就算我哋自己保留嘅嗰少部分咧，都係足夠係可以咧就逐年攤還誒我哋借貸嘅錢。

360
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:56,410
誒機管局嘅內部資金噉，其實依個係好多大公司都係噉樣做嘅，作為一個再投資。噉佢既然要用內部資金，咁咪唔派息咯。咁依個就好正常嘅。咁根據機管局條例咧，機管局係決定派唔派息嘅。咁第二咧就係佢要透過佢嘅誒營運嘅收入，包括誒。

361
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:16,420
向呢個用者嘅收費，咁呢個收費包括向航空公司啦，亦都係包括佢哋會引誒新引進嘅向乘客所收嘅呢個機場。主席，我想啊，局長簡單啲就係話，即係話，如果政府係繼續唔收呢個股息嘅話咧，喺政府嘅定義底下係唔算包底㗎啦。

362
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:42,130
另外仲有分零鐘啊！希望主席畀多啲時間我一陣，我畀畀多分鐘你啊。哦，多謝你啊。咁咧就係嗰個誒，因為我哋而家其實睇到嗰個誒三腳凳嗰個融資嘅誒籌集資金嗰個安排咧，噉就有面股息啦，有機場建設費啦，咁最尾就係機管局自己。

363
01:19:42,130 --> 01:20:02,140
誒借錢啦，噉就誒，但係我哋一路都冇聽到，其實基金會借錢之後咧，係會點樣還錢嘅咧？噉樣，噉我想誒林生可唔可以介紹下，其實基金局係諗住點樣還錢嘅咧？因為可能呢個借嘅錢，其實嗰個匯豐嗰個一。

364
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:44,280
具體關於嗰個融資嗰啲，機管局係諗住點樣去還嘅？因為而家就講緊點樣借嗰個錢啊嘛。好，誒或者我或者我解釋下依個問題啦。咁主要嚟講咧，其實誒嗰個誒報告都有有提到嘅，就將來咧我哋起完之後咧，當然我哋誒即係三跑完之後咧，我哋誒整個機。

365
01:20:44,280 --> 01:21:04,290
場本身嘅嗰個盈利嘅能力應該比依家就更加好。咁所以誒，一方面嚟講咧，我之前都有喺立法會有講過。一方面，我哋會當然會繼續收依個誒機場建設費，直到我哋係誒還完錢為止。但係當時我亦都保證過，喺呢段時間入邊咧，我哋係冇打算。

366
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:24,300
將嗰個機場建設費咧係會增加，咁所以依家我哋收緊嘅嗰個九十蚊、一百六十蚊、一百八十蚊，到時咧仍然會維持。咁第二樣咧就係當然係我哋自己嘅盈利入邊咧，就係可以用嚟咧就係攤還我哋借嘅錢。嗱，依個亦都包括咗，雖然咧佢嗰個誒誒財務預算入邊咧係預算。

367
01:21:55,850 --> 01:22:15,860
誒三跑嘅興建要去，即係維係住我哋而家香港嗰個未來嘅巷輸樓嗰個位置啊，或者創造就業嗰啲咧。原則上我自己就覺得都係認同同支持嘅。不過咧就誒，我相信大家市民大眾而家好關心咧，就係嗰個誒工程嘅就整個嘅項目嘅開支嘅問題。

368
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,580
下一位。

369
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,250
嗱，要中意。

370
01:26:48,300 --> 01:27:01,600
May not be to recover one delay, but you can look at make sure that it doesn't. There's no contagion into other aspects, and that you can recover other aspects of the project. So it's a very complex process, but we we spend a lot of time making sure that we have adequate cost controls.

371
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:49,280
To build it, we also do quite a lot of design early. So when we establish the budget, it was on a on a very very firm basis of our scheme design. We put in appropriate contingencies at that point to make sure that we have a robust budget.

372
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:28,010
work with them, the project management office keeps a careful control of of cost control, change control or other aspects. And the other big element already mentioned is risk management. We've already had an independent consultant at the very beginning do an independent risk management assessment.

373
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:35,870
因為始終一千四百億都係一個大嘅數目噉，而且過往咧誒，政府都有誒啲一啲工程，我哋見到係有超支，我諗市民真係好擔心噉。其實咧就誒呢件事咧，就過往我哋都有同過一啲工程嘅界嘅朋友咧，就傾過啊，有一啲嘅意見反映翻。

374
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:55,880
翻嚟咧就話有啲個別嘅一啲大型嘅工程咧，佢超支嘅時候有個其中嘅原因就係可能佢哋喺整個工程嗰啲部件咧，誒可能係好可能係好特殊嘅，噉佢好特殊嘅情況底下咧就唔係話咁普及去揾到呢啲部件，咁可能咧就會導致到萬一嗰個工程中間有咩少少問題。

375
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:15,890
出現咗咧，想話換過下啲部件啊，嗰啲咧就由於佢普及性唔話咁高咧，就可能會推高咗嗰個成個嗰個成本嘅。噉我想請教下機管局咧喺呢方面，即係三跑個整個工程咧，能唔能夠話到畀我哋聽係唔係誒呢方面你都有啲考慮，即係嗰個工程嗰個嘅設計或？

376
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:35,900
或者嗰個普及性係咪能夠可以相對嚟講咧係啊啊做一啲功夫去考慮一下，就唔好噉樣推高嗰個嗰個成本嚇，可唔可以解答一下唔該？局長或者總裁邊位答？好，等我或者答一啲問題。第一就周議員講嗰個咧，可能就未必係真係部件問題，可能喺設計嘅時候有時個設計比較獨特，噉。

377
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:55,910
比較設計獨特嘅時候咧，就可能去每一件誒，即係每一件誒，中間每一件嘢咧，都需要特別去誒製造。咁喺嗰個過程入邊咧，就令到成本有機會會係失去預算。噉我哋都好明白到依個問題。咁所以咧，其實其中一個我哋講。

378
01:23:55,910 --> 01:24:15,920
得誒可能會影響依樣嘢嘅，就係我哋將來起到嘅嗰個後基樓嘅嗰個屋頂嘅問題。咁所以其中一樣誒，我哋依家好要求嘅設計師做嘅就係話，希望誒整個屋頂嘅設計誒要絕大部分係可以所謂一個module嘅system，就係逐嘅去一塊可以逐塊不斷。

379
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:35,930
係可以重複，咁變咗可以做一塊出嚟咧，就其他其他嚟講咧，就可以就好似個工廠啤出嚟噉，就可以成套咁做出嚟，就唔需要話每件都係咁獨特。噉我哋仲要求做多一步咧，就係話希望做嘅時候咧，就要拎一件出嚟咧，就先做出嚟睇下先，睇下本身響製造嘅過程入邊會唔會遇到任何

380
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:30,900
即係點解咧？

381
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,310
有點係呃人嘅。

382
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,090
究竟打個問題問你？

383
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:10,520
呢個係冇乜機會嘅，相信嚟講係。

384
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,560
第二個想問一問局長。

385
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,490
但係係咪真係畀咗大家信心咧？即係我覺得就係依個係。

386
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:46,270
咁但係問題在於而家個機場建設費咧，其實我已經預早已經備咗出嚟先啦。

387
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,740
你係唔打冇打算定係一定唔會咧？可唔可以明確話畀我聽？

388
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:45,900
政府係咪對依一個嘅數字係完全認同，冇任何異議咧？

389
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:39,780
究竟喺呢個機場嗰建設費裏邊嚟講話咧，政府參與咗咩角色喺度？

390
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:54,480
無論係嗰個個別個人嘅收費，以照總體二百六十億裏邊嚟講，政府係咪完全同意？冇任何異議。

391
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:55,210
我哋冇任何嘅議價能力嘅喎。而家你一百八十蚊啊、九十蚊啊、八十蚊咧，有冇諮詢過市民嘅咧？

392
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:41,140
因為即係就剛才講公堂就係由政府畀嘅叫做公堂，咁市民畀嗰啲咪叫公堂咧？就唔係叫公堂嘅啦，就市民自己畀嘅啫。

393
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:21,540
上儘管剛才阿林生講咗話咧，就算係超支都好咧，就係佢唔打算會係增加依個機場收建設費嘅收費。

394
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:07,540
係完全冇諮詢市民嘅。有啩？你話幾多就幾多嘅。嗱，我話唔係咁多得唔得咧？市民有冇可以反對依個依個嘅嘅做法？有冇途徑反對咧？係。

395
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:22,660
主席，誒阿局長剛才咧就回答嗰時咧就講咗，就係誒政府就唔會即係因為任何嘅超支咧而作出包底嘅，咁呢個咧就畀咗市民好大嘅信心，即係唔使再喺公堂裏邊咧係支支付所有嘅超支嘅費用噉樣樣。

396
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:55,940
個困難咁喺噉嘅情況咧，就未我哋未投標之前咧，就已經知道啦。喺噉嘅情況咧，就會減低咗。將嚟投標之後咧，先發覺原來咧就嗰樣嘢係設計同埋原來去起嘅時候係中間有個差距，就變咗到時咧就先發覺原來係令到成本增加。噉我哋會做一啲啲噉。

397
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:15,950
噉嘅工作咧，儘量減少因應獨特設計而構成嘅一啲不必要嘅成本嘅上升。嗱，當然啦，就要係誒減低整個工程將來嘅超支嘅風險。呢個只係其中一範啫。我哋仲有好多其他部分咧，我覺得我哋都係要加強整個項目嘅管理，先至能夠令到。

398
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:35,960
我哋整個項目將來即係出現超少嘅風險降到最低。噉我想咧就或者嘥大家兩分鐘時間，請我嘅同事咧就阿潘生咧就或者喺呢方面都向大家介紹下。唔該，潘嘉旺。Thank you. Um, Sir, you mentioned one very careful is design. Make sure that you get the design right. Make sure it's it's it's simple, able

399
01:25:49,560 --> 01:26:09,570
But there's no one factor. It's a matter of constant proper project management. We've set up a project management office which provides a check and balance and functional leadership for cost and programme, separate from the project delivery team who are responsible for delivering the project. These are the guys who day to day push the contractors and.

400
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:48,300
That's a constant process. You don't just sit back on that. So we have a risk management manual. We continue to refresh that and review it throughout the project, making sure that risks are identified, that what-if scenarios are looked at, contingencies are developed. Not not just not not in money, but in terms of if something happens, you may.

401
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:37,620
主席，阿局長冇答到我咧。你對依個二百六十億嗰個嘅？

402
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:19,980
即係而家依個數字已經係比原先個數字低咗咯。你即係意思係講係講個機場建設費係。

403
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:33,360
噉樣依筆錢已經畀咗出嚟啦！我哋以市民嚟講係，即係你只不過係用納税人嗰個個角度睇，公堂角度睇啫嘛。好啦，阿梁宇瑩你夠鐘啦嚇，但係可能見仁見智啊。下一位係許志峯議員。

404
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:13,980
機管局提出嚟嘅方案嘅時候咧，其實我哋當時政府嘅意見就係話希望畀誒對乘客所收嘅嗰個誒機場建設費可以再調低嘅。咁機管局而家按照噉嘅意見嚟做，亦都係諮詢咗呢個旅遊業界嘅。

405
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:32,750
所以大型機場嘅擴建咧，同埋我哋而家依個三跑道系統咧，佢牽涉唔係淨係喺條跑道，實際上咧差唔多係一個新機場嘅規模，所以個成本高亦都係可以理解嘅。但係點都好，點樣能夠確保即係嗰個成本控制得好咧？依個的確機管局佢有好重要嘅責任。

406
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:14,850
兩部分。嗯，主席或者我我先回應幾句，嗱，先畀總裁再補充。第一喺機構提出呢個誒預算即係成本嘅預算嘅時候咧，誒政府方面，我哋嘅誒機場擴建統籌辦公室咧係有睇嘅，亦都係有我哋嘅財務顧問會睇翻佢成個用。

407
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:34,860
融資嘅安排究竟是否可行？咁至於話咧嗰個誒，一旦超支嘅時候點咧？當然我哋唔希望超支嘅誒，所以咧對嗰個工程合約嘅批出啊，對整個設計係好關鍵嘅。咁所以政府畀機管局好清楚嘅信息咧，就係話一定要喺設計上。

408
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:54,870
係必須嘅時候，先係作某啲嘅設計，即係唔好話誒做啲花巧嘢，而導致額外不必要嘅開支。同埋一定要物有所值。咁機管局亦都按照個原則去處理個合約嘅管理，同埋咧，佢哋都鑑於其他即係近年某啲嘅大型工程出現嘅情況咧，亦都係特別加強咗對。

409
01:29:54,870 --> 01:30:14,880
對工程開支方面嘅管控嘅噉，我哋希望咧，最終係唔需要超出呢個大數。當然就咁聽話一百誒一千四百幾億咧，一四一四一五億咧，聽嘅成數好大。但係如果大家有留意咧，英國倫敦希斯路機場最近講佢哋嘅三跑咧，佢哋個成本啊用港幣計咧都接近二千億嘅。

410
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:58,020
即係個財富財富嗰個嗰個分分佈嘅嗰個情況裏邊咧，係冇任何意義啊！你哋二百六十，同埋每一個嘅而家手費裏邊講話長途一百八十蚊啊，一百六十蚊啊，等等嗰啲嘢，係咪冇任何嘅意義啊？你哋冇任何比較意見出嚟嘅。主席，我哋喺誒呢個一四年嘅時候去睇基本。

411
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:40,410
誒上一上一屆嘅立法會，你有冇參加會議？我冇參加㗎。O K，唔怪得。但係我想問清楚啲咯，即係噉啊，阿局長再解釋嘅，或者我喺度補充下，阿阿總裁再解釋下。依個我哋覺得依個機場建設費咧，其實係真係確實係誒採用咗依個所謂用者自負依個原則。咁用者自負。

412
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:20,560
你可以加啦，甚至你可以整整一個新嘅誒費用嘅，叫做機場收支平衡費。

413
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:51,150
都提出咗五個，就係一啲比較極端少少嘅一啲下行嘅情景，去分析下喺噉嘅情況底下，個盤數得唔得咧？而財務顧問覺得係可行嘅。

414
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:36,520
主席，我以為基金講講得好清楚咧。等下林總裁再講下。我哋嘅嗰個計算入邊，誒未來嗰個機場建設費，我哋冇打算會增加。係咪保證嘅？係咪保證？

415
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:24,430
冇包底咯，即係如果你話政府一定唔會包底嘅話，我覺得喺起碼喺協議上面，你要反映到市民一定唔會包底嘅。你個呢個建設費，我永遠都唔會加㗎啦。就算超支幾多，我都唔會加㗎啦。你可唔可以有噉嘅承諾咧？

416
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:33,740
方面嘅費用，所以都經過咗行會批准咗。另外，按照依個誒機場管理局條例咧，機管局喺行使佢去營運呢個機場嘅過程裏邊，有啲費用要收嘅話咧，法庭嘅裁決都係佢可以收嘅。咁而家嗰個向旅客所徵收嘅機場建設費，屬於呢個類別。

417
01:31:40,410 --> 01:32:00,420
負我得同向市民誒收錢係有個分別喺度，因為咧其實誒用者自負就係話坐飛機嘅人就用啦，就畀錢啦。其實唔坐飛機嘅市民係唔需要畀。而實際上依家我哋機場嚟講，有七成嘅旅客並非係香港納税人，咁所以如果反而咧我哋向政府攞錢嘅話咧，就變咗你坐唔？

418
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:20,430
坐飛機你都要畀，依家嚟講咧就係你係坐飛機嘅人，你先要畀，你唔坐飛機唔使畀啦。咁仲係包包括咗大部分外國人，但係我哋冇得選擇嘅，我哋唔坐飛坐乜嘢咧？唔係噉，你喺外國咧就噉，你冇得選擇乜嘢咧？如果市民嘅話，完全唔坐飛機都要畀啦。如果係用納税人嘅錢，咁依家有七成咧，你話唔包底，其實噉樣呃人嘅咯。

419
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:53,650
多謝主席。誒，我都係喺個機場建設費嗰度咧，再想誒有多啲資料去問清楚。咁當然，你你話融資嘅方案裏邊講得好好聽，話共同承擔個名係好好聽嘅。咁實際上真係有一部分係香港市民嘅荷包攞出嚟㗎嘛。雖然頭先即係局長你話嗰啲係咪公帑啊，見仁見智啦。

420
01:32:53,650 --> 01:33:13,660
咧噉，所以頭先你話有七成唔係即係香港納税人嘅畀出嚟嘅。噉我想你，你有冇細嘅數字，真係喺香港納税人嘅畀出嚟嗰部分係幾多錢？即係係係幾多個納税人點樣點樣計？你自己有冇一個估算，即係一個具細啲嘅誒計嘅計法咧？

421
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:34,700
誒，B偉達誒主席，似乎咧，我如果我哋要名詞準確咧，即係唔應該用納税人，因為我哋唔敢確保所有乘客都係納税人啊。應該香港乘客同埋一啲非香港嘅旅客，或者省主誒，總裁補充下呢啲。誒，林總裁誒，頭先我講嘅就係話，你根據依家我哋誒機場旅客嘅嗰個即係。

422
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:54,710
誒分分誒分佈嚟講咧，就依家七成用機場嘅人係非香港人，咁有三成係用香港人。當然實際上嚟講咧，就好難。依家嚟講有個好具體嘅分野，但係大概上就係七三之分。咁所以可以話咧，依個機場建設費咧係有百分之七十到咧係由誒非香港人咧係。

423
01:33:54,710 --> 01:34:14,720
繳付咁呢個佢哋用我哋嘅機場，外國人誒去都幫我哋嘅三跑工程付一啲錢，我覺得呢個非常之合理。咁第二樣我就問下啦，喺法律上咧，嗱其實誒你用機管局嘅條例容許你收機場費啦，咁但係其實你而家收緊呢個建設費講緊嘅。

424
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:34,730
唔係你使用呢個機場嘅時候，要所產生出嚟嘅成本嘅費用嚟㗎。你因為如果根據即係機運局嘅條例係講緊呢個飛機著陸、起飛、停泊嗰啲費用啊嘛。噉你而家實質上個本質收咗啲錢係你嘅資本，係為為你未來嘅基建去。

425
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:54,740
雜誌喎，呢呢啲錢係連息都冇喎，對市民嚟講，噉係咪係咪喺法律上係徹底噉樣符合即係《建築條例》裏邊，你哋可以收費嗰個範圍咧？誒，主席或者我我可以代講講，因為依個問題咧，其實喺法院一啲司法訴訟案件嘅即係法官法庭都解釋好清楚嘅。根據而家機場。

426
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:24,820
或者我想請阿潘生答一於嗰個技術問題。係啊，潘嘉華生唔該。

427
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:59,850
令到誒將來我哋整個機場本身誒就能夠誒，亦都有啲新嘅體驗。

428
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:13,580
依個人流帶嚟嘅經濟效益嘅話咧，我哋覺得依個誒航天城項目咧，誒喺依方面係可以發揮一定嘅作用嘅。

429
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:06,300
因為而家嗱二號客運大樓都唔係好多人流啦，咁其實未來SkyCity你哋預計個人流同埋誒即係盈利收入等等會係點樣㗎？

430
01:34:54,740 --> 01:35:14,750
場管理局條例底下咧，有一種收費就唔係機管局隨意去收嘅，呢個就係即係啲landing charges啲着陸費啊，即係收航空公司嘅費用。如果機管局要調整嘅話咧，係需要得到誒誒行政長官會同行政會議審批嘅。咁呢個都係最近因為機管局都增加咗呢。

431
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:54,060
噉我噉我就想問啊！嗱，你頭先誒，議員都問過你，你都講過嘅，即係你打算個收費水平喺呢個收費期間維持不變嘛？但係技術上你係可以變嘅，你係可以增加嘅，係咪咧？定係技術上都唔得㗎啦，因為我寫死咗啦喺個喺個協議裏邊啦，係邊樣先係啱咧？啊，局長。

432
01:35:54,360 --> 01:36:14,370
誒主席，依個就冇協議。依個就係機管局佢提出嘅融資方案。好似剛才林總長所講咧，佢哋冇遇到咧嗰個機場誒建設費咧個水平有調整。即係總之喺依個建設期裏邊咧就係一致㗎啦，即係唔會唔會再改噉樣。咁噉，所以喺理論上，當真係超支嘅時候，你可以你。

433
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:40,850
跟住咪繼續收旅客錢，繼續收香港人嘅錢，去達到你嘅收支平衡到。噉你超支嘅時候都係另一個方式嘅誒包底咯，可唔可以咁講咧？我估依個好假設性嘅情況嚇，因為咧嗰個財務嘅融資安排咧，其實經過咗財務顧問嘅評估啦，財務顧問。

434
01:36:51,430 --> 01:37:11,440
咁起碼最後我嘅立場，我就係睇得到呢一種所謂嘅唔係包底喺技術上咧，你哋係可以喺呢個誒機場費嗰度咧，係做啲巧立名目咧，去再問市民攞錢。我覺得如果有空間係去再問市民攞錢嘅，呢個唔叫做係。

435
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:57,460
噉我諗，我哋喺公眾度講得出嚟，呢個就係最好嘅保證啦。好，下一位誒，郭佩凡議員係。嗯，多謝主席。嗯，我哋相信咧，即係誒，機場第三跑咧，對香港嚟講係一個非常之重要嘅基建，亦都係保持我哋作為即係航運物流中心同埋即係國際城市嘅一個重要。

436
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:17,470
基建噉，但係我哋知道咧，就係第三跑咧，要即係做一段時間先完成啦。噉啊，其實有啲有啲市民，尤其工商界咧，都好關心咧，即係誒，我哋會唔會再被延遲啊？追唔追到落後啊？等等。誒，例如咧，我哋而家知道咧，三跑嘅工程咧，仲係面對幾單嘅司法複核嘅。噉我哋好想知道咧，誒，你有冇預計？

437
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:37,480
即係呢啲噉嘅案件咧，會唔會仲有機會令到工程去推遲或者壓後？係有冇呢個可行性？噉就誒以而家嗰個預算誒，如果壓後嘅時候對即係整個整體嘅預算有幾大嘅影響咧？以前就講過話推遲一年就要加七十億啦。咁而家仲有冇誒噉樣嘅一個評估咧？咁可唔可以答咗？

438
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:57,490
有問題先，唔該，主席局長，機管局講講係啊，工程方面嘅影響。當然，依家嘅司法覆核咧，就仲有誒兩宗咧，就誒法院雖然已經誒聽咗雙方嘅陳詞，都未認真由誒誒判決嘅噉，所以誒依兩宗咧，我哋都未知道個結果係點樣。咁大家知道。

439
01:38:57,490 --> 01:39:17,500
香港司法獨立咧，我哋當然不能夠預測究竟法庭會點樣判啦。咁誒，如果誒法庭誒判決嘅嗰個結果係誒需要我哋延遲嘅話，要當然會對我哋成本會有啲增加啦。噉我哋就冇作最新嘅一個評估。噉我哋依家有嘅都仍然係以前坐落。

440
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:37,510
嘅一啲一啲數據咧，咁所以我哋當時做過就，如果係誒二五一年嘅話咧，就有七十億嘅嘅額外嘅一個支出，即係而家都係噉。咁主席，我相信係時候即係去作一個最新嘅評估，等我哋大眾市民知道即係未來有機會面對咩個風險同埋後果啦。噉啊，第二咧就係誒，我想都瞭解一下關於。

441
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:57,520
sky city嗰個計劃嘅，我想知道咧就誒sky city第時落成之後嗰個誒嗰個帳目或者分紅嘅安排會係點樣嘅咧？誒，如果落成之後，其實有冇考慮過對誒，即係誒誒，即係整體財政個安排會唔會帶嚟幾多嘅貢獻誒？

442
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:30,880
係啊！

443
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,380
誒係咪？

444
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:18,850
出現一個問題咧，你要向市民解釋清楚。

445
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:12,480
我係好重視嗰個北商業區嗰個發展，呢個SkyCity。

446
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,850
嗱，包底咧，我諗你你真係喺panel裏面咧，要同大家解釋清楚。

447
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:55,430
website where all of the data is uploaded, so that's freely available, and we are at the moment there are there are no impacts from the project to water quality.

448
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:07,500
O.K.嗱，第一輪誒提問咧就總共有十三位同事就演完啦。我哋進入第二輪之前咧，我都想問一啲嘢。

449
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:29,740
當然嗰個業權啊，地業權係機管局，機管局係咪就係收租咧？將來就係誒畀發展商佢哋去去發展，機管局就收翻個租，就係佢佢嘅收益咧。

450
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:15,190
兩個途徑，一個咧股東集資，誒冇政府就係股東啦嘛，即係政府畀錢啦嚇。另外一個咧就係利用個機構本身嘅盈利咧，係唔派息、唔派、唔分潤，利用嗰啲賺到嘅錢咧，係繼續投資喺業務方面嗱。

451
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:26,590
主席，啊，因為正如我頭先解釋啦，誒，我哋依個Sky City嘅項目咧，並不打算咧就係響即係我係地租出去嘅初期咧，就一筆過問發展商就攞一筆誒地價啦。響噉嘅情況之下咧，就分攤咁多年咧，就我哋估計響誒頭嗰段。

452
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:46,600
時間咧就對我哋誒三跑或者我哋機管局本身嘅現金流係冇乜幫助。咁誒當然長期嚟講咧，我哋好希望咧依個係能夠為我哋整個機場係帶來一啲新嘅項目，令到將來坐飛機嘅人用我哋機場嘅人咧就有一個唔同嘅一個即係體驗。咁嗰個反而咧就

453
01:40:46,600 --> 01:41:06,610
可能誒比話將落呢塊地能夠為機管局誒揾多幾多錢更加重要。噉我哋相信誒，我哋三跑誒起完之後，誒我哋估計到時誒出入香港機場嘅嗰個旅客會達到超過一億人次以上。響噉樣嘅人流之下咧，其實係可以，我哋如果要想充分利用到。

454
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:33,880
誒，但係主席，你總有一個即係誒誒，商務即係商業計劃，需要一個business plan，即係呢一個sky city未來即係嗰個收益啊、人流啊等等嘅一個計算噉，同埋一個誒分紅嘅預測㗎嘛，係嘛？誒，噉我哋依家都喺度做緊呢個計劃啦。噉就誒，當然就。

455
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:53,890
到時我哋招標嘅時候咧，先至知道實際上依個項目咧，就將來誒，即係響未來嗰五十年入邊咧，就會帶來一啲乜嘢嘅經濟效益。但係我哋好希望誒招標嘅時候咧，更加重視係誒揾到一啲咧就比較創意嘅一啲發展商，能夠為依個項目帶嚟一啲新嘅一啲理念。

456
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:20,140
係誒噉，我諗主席，當你有噉嘅計劃嘅時候，亦都應該拎嚟我哋嘅小組，等我哋可以誒進一步瞭解噉啊，主席。咁另外第三個問題，即係短問短答啦。我想睇下你哋而家誒一路開展緊工程嘅時候咧，其實大家都關心對附近水質啊、水域嘅影響，有冇一個最新嘅評估，或者有冇啲咩誒新嘅報告咧？

457
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:45,770
Yes, thank you. Although construction has started, and so in accordance with the environmental impact assessment and our commitments under the environmental permit, we've started full monitoring of water quality, noise, air quality. Those are being have been captured since or August, and and we have a dedicated

458
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:50,030
誒誒，主席一陣我可以畀阿林總裁講講。不過咧，我今日聽到好幾位議員，包括主席你啦，都對北商業區嘅發展或者切近問題興趣。誒，其實咧嗰個因為我同政府睇法，呢個就唔係三跑嘅部分嚟嘅，但係絕對可以喺立法會誒經濟發展事務委員會去跟進嘅。嗱，我明白嘅，因為我哋個個街市。

459
01:43:50,030 --> 01:44:10,040
咧作作為個機場嚟講咧，揸一個飛機起落就冇乜用嘅，即係一定係要有一套配套設備。等於我哋起一個誒住宅區裏面都要配套啦嚇，機場更加要有咁配套。就問題咧，個配套得嚟咧，誒，我哋喺機管局嘅收益咧，我諗大家都比較關。

460
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:30,050
住嘅呢樣嘢，你哋準備下資料，將嚟喺plan好裏面傾嘅喺嗰度可以做。第二個話你提個問題，即係咪即係租出嚟嗰度可以畀阿林總裁？誒噉啊誒，我我諗今日唔使答啊，第日你plan好答啊。第二個問題咧，就係嗰個誒，今日我總結咧，好多同事咧都問問到個所謂政府包大。

461
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:38,630
人手咧就係由二百一十九人咧，就升到二百九十一隻，即係多三成。

462
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:57,110
如果唔係你蝕錢嘅話，你係一定會分花紅畀畀翻政府。

463
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:26,650
個五千幾咁一零啦，跟住咧就二零一二年至二零一三年年度咧就四十四億。我想問一問咧，你哋大概比率係幾多啊？

464
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:50,640
咗機管局個荷包嚇，兩件事係係完全唔同。我想問下，係咪係咪確保二零二四年？

465
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:22,340
盈餘真係盈餘係啊，即係唔係講話你完，但係你Davidson你係做係咯。Davidson唔派花紅啊嘛，噉你而家就將佢扣起曬啊嘛。係咪呢度四百七十億係全部嚟自唔派出嘅花紅咧？

466
01:48:57,730 --> 01:49:13,340
當然誒，好似我頭先講，根據誒機管局條例誒派唔派花紅或者派幾多，要由當年嘅董事局決定啦。我哋嘅財務計劃入邊係誒只係保留到二零二四。O.K. 下一位誒，譚文豪議員。

467
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:56,140
誒，究竟包底同呢個機管局負責將來嗰個投資嗰個發展嘅投資係有乜唔同？嗱，如果以我啊幾廿年做生意嘅常識嚟講咧，我要發展業務咧，係嗰個資金嘅籌集咧，誒，基本上係有。

468
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:39,140
個後果係點咧？係會賺更多嘅錢係咪啊？嗯。將來派息咧，會比而家收嘅息咧係多好多嘅，會唔會咧？嗯。啊，咁所以咧，我哋而家呢筆係投資落去，就唔係向市民要要要刮咩窿。嗯。要明白呢樣嘢。嗯。

469
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:59,150
要講清楚，因為做生意之道話唔好話，淨係誒而而家要要要考慮到點樣樣集資啊諸如此類嗰啲嘢啊。噉我諗你哋要向我哋立法會議員以及全港市民解釋點解呢樣嘢。好，進入第二個round，亦都係嗱，因為嘅。

470
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:19,160
時間好問咧，我哋三分鐘好嘛？啊，陳淑章議員，多謝主席。我想問下政府咧，誒，你哋嘅税税後嘅收益啊，個機管局嘅税後收益同誒平時嘅dividend即係花紅嗰個比例大概係點嘅？我見到咧，一三年至一四年咧就係五十三億啦派紅誒，跟住誒即係呢一個。

471
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:48,070
誒，主席誒，正如剛才總裁都有講到咧，機管局個一直以嚟嘅做法咧，就係唔係將所有嘅盈餘全部派息嘅，佢派上咗。我得㗎啦，我明嘅主席，我問你多多嗰個誒，你哋嗰個比例係點？佢冇一個固定，即係每一年一月度一樣嘅。不過當然咧，我哋可以提供資料喺過去嚟講咧。

472
01:46:48,070 --> 01:47:08,080
董事會，因為最終嚟講決定派息幾多，你提供翻資料，多謝主席。我哋畀翻資料，即係過去係明白明白係啦。咁另外，我就想問下啦。如果我個瞭解冇錯嘅話咧，你哋咧係扣起呢個營運盈餘咧，即係呢個四百七十億咧，係咪呢四百七十億係你哋預計係全部都係嚟自花紅㗎？係咪十年嘅花紅啊？其實就唔係花紅。

473
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:42,670
誒或者幾乎可以再補充誒絕大部分係，但係都噉樣嘅。我哋每年咧，其實誒就應預入邊咧，就一部分我哋都用嚟作機場本身嘅發展。明白誒咁一部分就用嚟誒派畀派畀政府啦。咁誒，除咗依樣嘢之外，我哋都包括咗嚟緊咧。我哋誒九月一號開始咧，我哋加咗啲價啦。

474
01:47:42,670 --> 01:48:02,680
好似誒嗰個誒landing fee啊等等，令到我哋收入都增加咗。咁所以主要嚟就依一依一度啦。咁但係咧都咁講，因為根據文件咁問㗎，係啊，因為B佢解釋保留誒營運營員，所以我跟住佢咁問。冇錯冇錯。噉係諗住扣起幾多年咧？主要嗱，主要咧，依家我哋我誒預計咧就係由依家八年入邊咧就。

475
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:22,690
依一個係去到二零二四年咧，我哋準備到時咧就會重新誒，即係考慮誒派息嘅問題啦。當然嗰個都要由當時嘅董事嗰個決定啦。不過我亦都要咁講，實際上嚟講咧，誒依一筆錢入邊咧，仲係包括咗其實未來嗰八年咧，我哋都仍然要用好多錢落去現有機場嘅改建。

476
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,290
嗱。

477
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:14,960
下一位啊，問朱亞迪爾。

478
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:19,780
係唔該，主席。咁咧頭先啊，誒局長就。

479
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:29,930
佢就話咧誒唔收股息，政府繼續唔收機管局股息咧，就唔算係包底。噉我係好唔同意呢個講法嘅，因為香港市民其實。

480
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:12,710
誒，民航處人手特別係空管人手係短缺，依個我哋清楚嘅。我哋已經亦都係向喺政府裏邊咧，亦都向最高層講咧，我哋未來幾年咧一定要加人手嘅，要配合呢個三跑嘅發展嘅。啊，依樣我係知道。OK。

481
01:52:50,220 --> 01:53:08,190
續要派息係由基金局去決定，咁跟住局長就話呢個唔係包底咧。我覺得係誒，我唔能夠同意呢個講法嘅變相。其實我哋嘅市民係要繼續係為到呢個基三跑嘅可能嘅超支咧，係要繼續有承擔嘅。

482
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:42,700
啊！主席，我想問一問咧，即係如果咧八年二零二四年之後咧，佢頭先話誒要留翻畀個board去決定啦。咁但係如果二零二四年之後都唔派花紅嘅話，而我可唔可以當係政府嘅包底？因為啊啊，主席唔好介意，因為派咗花紅咧就會入政府個水塘，但係而家唔派花紅咧就入。

483
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:33,630
副主席係唔該，主席誒，我就都講翻頭先咧。我都問海沙，都問咗好耐啦，即係你哋好多都係因為呢啲誒商業元素啊、商業因素啊，而唔肯講一啲嘅資料。咁其實我哋即係立法會係好難嚟，我監察。其實我哋一樣嘢就我唔係真係要知幾多錢，我係驚會唔會超支嘅啫。其實講嚟講去都噉，所以咧，我諗緊咧，可能誒。

484
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:53,640
誒往即係往後，你哋要諗下一個咩方法係可以提供畀立法會，係一個即係帳目表又好點樣都好，一個大數知道係唔會超支。譬如如果你話超支超過五個percent嘅，你可以睇到即係將來哦，最後埋單可能係一四一五嘅加加五個percent超過嘅話，我諗到時要一個嘅通報機制。

485
01:49:53,640 --> 01:50:13,650
話翻畀立法會知咯，可以嘅話係咪七十七十億㗎，五個percent係咯係咯，即係咁上下啦，咁上下啦，即係幾多數幾多數都好啦，即係嗰個可以講嘅，大家可以傾有個數幾多都唔緊要嗱。好啦，我反而想另外講一講另外一樣嘢咧，就關於誒空管人手嘅問題喺將來你哋第三跑落成咗之後，呢個就可能就唔關誒基本股市啦，呢個就主要都係。

486
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:33,660
係啊，局長嗰個問題嗱，我畀少少數字啦。嗱，喺一九九九年雙跑道用緊嘅時候咧，其實就誒飛機嘅升降量，連埋過境飛機咧，就二十四萬度。咁去到二零一五年咧，就去到六十三萬嘅個總數係噉，相差咧就誒二點五倍。咁但係空管前線空管人。

487
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:58,920
啊，航班多咗兩倍半，但係人手啊多得三成，咁所以其實佢哋而家咧都已經係好唔夠人㗎啦。我話畀你知，咁但係嚟緊咧三跑，你講緊大約八年時間，通關人員亦都唔係話你請就即刻有，而你請咗亦都要訓練嘅。佢哋攞牌咧，第一個牌可能都要講緊成即係四。

488
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:18,930
年左右嘅時間噉，所以其實誒，我希望誒局方咧，或者都要同一同銀行處傾一傾呢一方面，你哋安排嗰人手嗰度咧，其實可以早少少，即係可能未來一兩年已經要開展嚟到請多啲人手去應付三跑。希望局方可唔可以簡短打答，可唔可以做到呢樣嘢？

489
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:38,940
同埋可唔可以做到？頭先所講就係話誒，即係你定期畀翻個數。如果係過咗某一個誒成個工程過咗某一個位嘅話，你要話畀我哋知。好簡短啊，阿副主誒主席，第一點咧，下一個會議咧，我哋係有一個有關人力規劃及發展呢個議題嘅。你超前咗啦，不過儘量簡單。我我簡單。

490
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:58,950
唔快簡單。第一點咧，關於海沙嗰啲問題咧，其實從政府又好啊，居屋最顧慮就係咧，我哋唔想將啲商業敏感、合約敏感嘅嘢拎出嚟啫。不過我明白譚議員個關心喺邊度，我哋試下睇下用咩方式表述令到你安心。反正我哋下遲下都會有一個特別嘅議程，係會講財務嗰啲嘢。我對時我睇講第二咧就。

491
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:50,220
望住呢個基金局一個穩定嘅股息畀政府咧，其實係一個重要嘅收入嚟嘅。而家呢個其實變相係政府攞咗市民覺得已經係袋咗落袋嘅錢咧，係攞嚟去貼基金局呢個三炮工程。咁如果你話誒變咗二零二四年嘅時候，到底係唔係繼？

492
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:25,990
結束。

493
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,730
發展相關事宜。

494
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:53,360
噉啊！如果冇誒其其他上咧，就宣佈會議結束。

495
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:25,010
好啦，誒，今日嘅會議咧，就誒，呢個議程咧，就。

496
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:17,840
到咗啊！依個同深圳會有啲大家要配合，的確係噉樣。誒，但係我哋嘅對口唔係深圳，我哋對口係國家民航局。

497
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:28,660
咁咧就我就想問翻誒空域嘅問題嘅，因為而家誒三十二同埋三十三段咧都有提到一啲誒同誒珠三角誒之間嘅安排嘅。咁但係其實我哋誒市民就好想知道到底呢啲具體安排有冇文件可以畀我哋睇到誒？

498
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:48,670
誒特別係二零零七年嗰個方案，具體嘅詳細嘅文件啦，同埋最近誒同誒珠三角各方溝通嘅文件嘅誒，自然啊，你又好超前啊，係咪心急一啲咧？誒，我哋專門有一個有個議題咧，有個議程咧，係安排喺六月份。

499
01:53:48,670 --> 01:54:08,680
十三段係有講呢個進展有空域㗎嘛？佢嗰個全面介紹嗱，我哋咧喺六月份咧專門有一節係講呢個空域嘅。啊，主席，我諗啊，局長會想今日時間咧就好問啦，要講咧好可能好長篇，你手安無躁係咪等？

500
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:28,690
第二日專門有個主席，其實你都唔使幫啊，局長。我唔係幫啊，佢係可以答，佢會答得。你絕對唔好話幫。佢會答㗎嘛？你仲要令到你幫我咩啫？我幫你更加了解呢個問題啊嘛！我幫啊，局長想答你做咩？嗱，你問下副主席，我哋傾嗰個議程裡面啊，成個。

501
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:48,700
公嗰個議程嘅程序咧，係有一次專門傾呢個問題㗎嘛。你咁急做咩啫？噉你係咪叫阿局長唔使答咧？主席，局長梗係要答啦，咩唔答啫？第日專門一次答你㗎。即係今日你係唔使局長答咧？今日局長答，我覺得佢答得唔清唔楚，時間太短。

502
01:54:49,590 --> 01:55:09,600
我三分鐘，點解你唔畀局長答咗我？噉我而家畀多三分鐘。我明你個，我明你個邏輯咯，就係解釋解釋得多空空域問題咩？我唔明你個邏輯，點解而家局長唔可以講嘢？可以，不過我我我我咁可唔可以？你可唔可以唔好再同我？我同你講，我專門有一節啊，你知啊？資源，梗係知啦，我哋你梗係唔知啦。我唔講你點？

503
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:29,610
唔知啫，會唔知咧？局長，你唔好無意我哋呢個。主席，誒正如你所講咧，我哋係預咗有特別一節咧，係講空域問題嘅。嗱，但係咧，誒我哋過去喺上一屆立法會都講過啦。二零零七年嗰個誒我哋叫二點零版本嘅方案咧，嗰個係唔可以公開嘅，因為嗰個。

504
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:49,620
係政府與政府之間嘅一啲文件嚟嘅。不過咧，我哋過去都係將盡量將裏邊一啲對空域嘅管理同埋善用嘅問題，誒相關嘅嘢都盡量去講，同埋以助公眾釋義。最近喺今年應該五月份嘅時候，誒國家銀行局、香港銀行處同埋澳門銀行局咧。

505
01:55:49,620 --> 01:56:09,630
簽定咗加強合作啊、交流機制嗰啲新聞公佈，我哋都係有有發表咗上網添嘅。誒，我哋喺誒今年嚟講咧，就誒喺空域嘅嗰個運用問題咧，其實同內地國家民航局以及呢個澳本咧都係相對得誒非常好嘅。當然有啲人關心。

506
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:46,280
下一個議題咧就係其他事項。誒，下一次會議係定於二零一七年二月七號禮拜二下晝兩點半舉行。誒，討論嘅主要就係三跑系統嘅造價同埋財務安排計劃，以及誒同三跑發誒三跑系統發展嘅有關人力規劃同埋。
