1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,010
立法會主席。

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,890
兩間生意。

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,740
係。

4
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,740
而家會議廳裏邊。

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,500
不足發電人數，請你點算發電人數。

6
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,150
梁繼昌業。

7
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:27,910
先生，我正喺度支持議席主辦人嘅提議，去引用規例51-1嘅規例程序，設立一個常任委員會去研究呢個法案，而唔係將呢個法案提交給全體議會嘅委員會。

8
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,780
The reason why I support the Andreset House proposals are threefold. First of all.

9
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:49,690
The using of a select committee is a more efficient use of time. Secondly, it is more effective in achieving a more sensible and better results for all the stakeholders in the present circumstances.

10
00:13:50,030 --> 00:14:04,710
And thirdly, Mr. President, it is for practical reasons, which I will outline later, that I think the invoke of Section Rule 51A is a better solution to break the stalemate.

11
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,420
Now, before I go into more detail, let us look at how Rule 51.

12
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,840
Works.

13
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,100
In fact, rule 56 also refers to rule 55.

14
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:30,210
是説，在條56，那，選舉委員會可以審查，不討論法案的原則，但可以討論法案的細節。

15
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:46,950
And also, the select committee can make such amendments as they think fit. In a way, of course, we can see that the scope and function of a select committee is no different compared to a committee consisting the whole council.

16
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:59,940
Now, if we turn to Rule 60, which deals with the procedure in select committee, it said the bill can be amended in a select committee.

17
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:11,290
And then, after the amendment, the whole text of the bill as amended will be printed as part of the report of the select committee, which means.

18
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:23,590
The chairman of the select committee, on behalf of the select committee, can and should produce a report, which contains any amendments, if necessary, endorsed by the select committee.

19
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,660
And we go on to rule sixty one.

20
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,710
which outlines the procedure on reporting of a bill from the select committee.

21
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,500
Now, if the select committee has adopted the report.

22
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:46,630
然後，法案可以動，和當然，報告會被動作為動議，動議由主席委員會主席。

23
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,490
And of course, the motion will be debated in this council as a motion.

24
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,320
Now, if that motion is agreed by this council without amendment.

25
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,780
Then, the council shall be deemed to have ordered the bill to be set down for third reading.

26
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,050
Mr. President, in the circumstances.

27
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,700
的。

28
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,820
debate on the committee stage amendment, if any, would be.

29
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,890
forfeited this procedure, if.

30
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,220
first of all, the select committee.

31
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:31,560
unanimously adopts a report, and secondly, the council here.

32
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,550
By majority, adopts the motion to adopt the select committee's report.

33
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,810
As you note, Mr. President, the debate on the committee stage amendment.

34
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,330
could be lengthy, could be cumbersome.

35
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,820
In fact.

36
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,730
我已經花費過去一到兩個月在研究和研究三個修正案，三個主要修正案。

37
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:02,840
Content override, user-generated content and also the fair using amendments to the bill itself.

38
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,210
我 found vast amount of literary studies and research, which I think are valid.

39
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,620
and worthwhile points to be made in this council.

40
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:26,320
我唔會低估過時間，它會要花費去過渡討論的時間。事實上，如果我們做一個簡單的計算，去計算需要多少時間。

41
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,850
to debate the amendments, I will.

42
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:38,600
Guess， it would be at least about hundred hours， if each of us is going to speak， and if each of us is going to

43
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,710
Make valid, non-trivial, non-repetitive points.

44
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,520
and this is a lot of time constraint on us.

45
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,850
and secondly, why I say.

46
00:17:51,260 --> 00:18:00,210
The use of the select committee is a more effective use of time. Is that, Mr. President? As you can see.

47
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,600
一委員會 consist of the whole chamber of the whole council.

48
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:17,560
是， in fact a waste of resources and time, because as you can note, many of us here, present in this chamber, is not even at least interested in the bill.

49
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,810
Some of us are not.

50
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,940
May not have a clue of what the copyright amendment bill was.

51
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,900
範國威，本人要求點算法定人數？

52
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,820
兩計槍員。

53
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:43,890
啊，Thank you, Mr. President. I was talking about the use of Rule 51(1) because it is a more effective and more efficient way of getting things done. Because all of us, all 70 of us, are trapped in this chamber if we are going to conduct a thorough discussion by a committee of the whole.

54
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,780
會。

55
00:25:45,180 --> 00:26:05,190
現在，其實， many of us not interested in this bill. Many of us may not have the capacity or the ability to articulate anything sensible about this bill, let alone that I understand many of us are speaking, quoting from newspaper reports, Facebook's lazy man's banana bow. And what value would it add?

56
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:13,120
如果，您知道，主席，討論一個重要的法案是這樣進行的。

57
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,480
now，looking at the select committee，in fact。

58
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:35,730
Our honourable friends on the other side can determine the pace, the scope, the combination, the tempo of the discussion of the select committee. And in fact, the select committee will run in parallel while business will be carried on as usual by this chamber.

59
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:56,020
Now, if you look at the composition of the bills committee, I understand that 25 of the honourable members have joined the bills committee, and in fact there, of course, there are 45 who haven't done anything yet or to contribute to improve the bill. Now, the for

60
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:04,230
Formation of a select committee will give these other members who haven't joined the bills committee, such as myself.

61
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,850
要有一個，at the bill。

62
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:18,940
Now, the honourable Mr. Coq has mentioned yesterday that the formation of a select committee will in fact, de facto, be scrapping all the work, the good work of the bills committee.

63
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,650
This argument, I respectfully disagree.

64
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:36,860
因為法案委員會， has focused on the bill for a long time, has made a lot of improvement to the bill, and has come up with three major amendments.

65
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,020
和，The reason of the formation of this committee.

66
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:56,370
is to have a more focused discussion and review of the feasibility of these three major amendments, which the minister, Mr Grechso, has repeatedly said we do not have time.

67
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,210
to discuss it.

68
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,790
That's why they cannot take any, even one of any those amendments.

69
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:24,960
Now of course the select committee is also a good venue for deputations to be invited to come to air their views. Now of course I mean in the past months or so there are a lot of deputations invited to give views to the bills committee.

70
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:38,280
And I also noted that the minister has also invited a number of copyright holders two weeks ago on a Friday, while we were having a finance committee meeting to vent their views.

71
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:54,280
And I have to say that, Mr. President, the arrangement was very inappropriate, very inconvenient, and the atmosphere was like a kind of exercise to put a lot of pressure to the already very busy legislators who have a very tight schedule.

72
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:03,820
And I trust, Mr. So, you would agree that if a select committee is being formed, then I think these copyright holders.

73
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:11,970
作為，作為，或者市民，或者香港市民，都有很多的疑慮。

74
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:22,710
會有更多時間和空間，去有個 thorough、 sensible and reasonable 討論，所以所有其他側面可以來到一個共識。

75
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,380
now also。

76
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:38,980
The formation of the select committee will contain new members of this council who have never had the chance to join the bills committee, and that would also breed a new angle into examining.

77
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
The nitty-gritties of the bill.

78
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Now，for all those practical reasons。

79
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,290
時間、 cost、 effective、 efficiency， Mr. President。

80
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,520
我會給我支持，Mr. Sitthoe的提案。

81
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:12,630
And the other thing I would like to mention is the present circumstances of the timetable of legislation would not allow us to give more time to the discussion of the copyright amendment bill in this chamber.

82
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,680
There are 18 pieces of legislation at different stages of the legislative process.

83
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:33,270
Some are in the bills committee stage. Some have finished the work of the bills committee, and some of the bills has just gone through the first and second reading.

84
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:44,890
Now, of course, many stakeholder will have different view on how important these legislations are to the various sectors of the community.

85
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:55,440
但作為立法者，代表著會計選區，也熟悉金融服務業的運作，主席。

86
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,070
我會 like to point out to you two very important bill, if the passage of which

87
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:22,440
cannot be achieved within the sitting of the legislature. That would mean dire consequences to the whole of Hong Kong. I'm talking about the whole of Hong Kong, the economy, the status of Hong Kong as the premier international financial centre.

88
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,250
The first such bill, Mr. President, is a 550 pages.

89
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,730
叫《The Financial Institutions Resolution Bill》。

90
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,710
and this comes.

91
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:43,800
with subsidiary legislations of considerable volume and perhaps twice or thrice the size of this bill.

92
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,940
and what is this financial institution resolution bill?

93
00:31:49,040 --> 00:32:09,050
它 is trying to establish a regime for the orderly resolution of financial institutions, which include insurance companies, banks and stockbrokers, with a view to avoiding or mitigating the risk otherwise posed by their non-viability to the stability and effective working.

94
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,810
of the financial system of Hong Kong.

95
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,970
先生， many banks.

96
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:24,350
保險公司 have come to speak to me and other legislator, telling me that if this bill is not passed,

97
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:33,910
within the sitting of the legislative council, many of the banks will be considering withdrawing, closing down the branches or the operations here.

98
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,650
我唔係威脅你。

99
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,410
My honourable friends, if you read up the S&P today.

100
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:46,830
巴克萊銀行正考慮一個全球減員。

101
00:32:47,110 --> 00:33:01,150
In many countries, that may affect Hong Kong as well. And as you note, we are coming to a downward economic cycle, and if because of the non- passage of the financial

102
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,480
institution restoration bill.

103
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,180
The financial institutions are withdrawing from Hong Kong. I think we cannot bear this dire consequence.

104
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:23,700
另一個立法是內地税收修訂法案2016，which has just gone through the first and second reading, Wednesday.

105
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:30,400
Now, this bill amended inland revenue ordinance to enable Hong Kong to comply with the international standard for automatic.

106
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,000
exchange of financial account information regarding tax etc.

107
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,600
If we do not,

108
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:47,630
conduct the first information exchange. I mean the automatic information exchange by 2018. By 2018.

109
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,910
We will probably become.

110
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:58,190
一 jurisdiction under the blacklist. What does this blacklist means? This is a blacklist.

111
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,750
梁繼昌完。

112
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,970
Mr. President, that's very quick.

113
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,600
我講緊關於內地税收修訂法案2015。

114
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:35,230
which enable Hong Kong to comply with the international obligation for automatic exchange of financial information.

115
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,540
If we cannot conduct the first piece of information exchange by 2018,

116
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,470
We will probably end up on the blacklist.

117
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,930
last year.

118
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,690
In July, August time.

119
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,300
The some of the EU countries.

120
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,350
have inadvertently included Hong Kong on the blacklist.

121
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,280
of jurisdictions as a tax haven.

122
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,520
It is a blow to the reputation of Hong Kong. If Hong Kong is seen,

123
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,830
作為jurisdiction to encourage tax evasion and avoidance.

124
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,960
will have severe consequences.

125
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:27,790
people from OECD countries, from G20 country, will think twice, thrice before investing into Hong Kong.

126
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,490
所以，我會 urge。

127
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:35,660
The members of all parties to support Sitheu's proposal to invoke Rule 51, sub one.

128
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:56,580
林嘉標，姚，都係主席。剛才十五分鐘嘅發言時間，又點咗四次嘅人數，咁所以泛民嘅表現咧，根本就係話畀佢聽。透過提出呢一個成立法案專責委員會，本身呢個討論就係一個拉布嘅延續。好啦，成立咗呢個專責委員會。

129
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,750
亦都係一個拉布嘅平台。

130
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:19,040
但係，我就想翻翻個核心嘅問題，即係當然我係反對呢個議案啦。個核心嘅問題有兩點：第一，成立呢個專責委員會係咪真係可以慳時間咧？頭先或者昨晚泛民嘅議員雙重標準、假慈悲噉樣講，哎呀，我哋都想施政順利啊，唔想大家喺度捱啊，想點樣點樣。

131
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:19,900
噉。

132
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:40,190
即係，但係個表現好清楚咧，拉布第一個核心問題係咪真係可以慳時間咧？第二個核心問題係咪真係可以解脱到拉布嘅困局？咁如果係咁咧，我想翻翻轉頭喺睇程序上，頭先當張繼聰議員咧不停講六十一條，即係議事規則裡面就啊，如果

133
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:53,070
專責委員會即係完成咗有一個報告，呢個報告咧通過咧就可以三讀。咁但係我想講，呢個報告本身係需要辯論嘅。

134
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:13,560
議員亦都可以就呢個報告提出修訂案，當然因為喺實踐上從來未試過咧，嗰個英文嘅寫法就係an amendment，但係到時會唔會出現財委會噉樣出現無限嘅amendment咧？冇人知道，亦都可以再拗。咁第三就係呢個專責委員會要。

135
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
開幾耐會咧？

136
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:35,550
幾耐先完成到報告咧？最後就係如果呢個專責委員會喺立法會裏面附諸表決呢個報告，係要分組點票嘅。咁如果本身個報告泛民又係唔收貨，咁分組點票否決咗啦，又會點咧？又走翻去全體委員會。

137
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,320
所以根本就係無限拉布。

138
00:37:40,260 --> 00:38:00,270
咁好啦，如果你話專責委員會可以就成立嘅時候咧，聽多啲人嘅意見，可能有新觀點，咁但係我哋不能夠忽視草案委員會所作出嘅巨大努力，開咗廿四次會，裏面有好多嘅成員，裏面。

139
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:20,280
面有好關心，亦都有啲自在表態，好快又退出嘅議員。噉我就唔明點解要架牀跌屋，除非係有新嘅事件發生咗，就係話當倉委員會完成佢嘅工作，去到立法會正在審議期間，有新嘅重大嘅突發。

140
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:40,290
嘅事件出現咗，令到我哋再睇下啊個法案係咪可以要改咁？我成立個專責委員會咯。咁但係我又睇唔到，我哋睇到咧網民或者一一撮嘅網民啊，我唔唔知有幾多一撮嘅網民係逼到泛民議員原本覺得可以接受，就個個變位。

141
00:38:40,340 --> 00:39:00,350
不能接受，甚至全部投身壓咗住去做拉布。睇下即係反對派，而家一個都唔喺度。咁所以咧，究竟嗰個改變係真係有啲事件出現咗，定係佢哋自己嘅立場改變咗咧？咁所以搞呢個專責委員會咧。

142
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:20,360
即係好難説服到我哋係為咗慳時間，亦都能夠令到拉布係能夠得到一個即係個困局能夠得到解脱。可能就係令到佢哋，尤其主流嘅泛民咧啊，有份拉布呢個形象得到解脱，但係事實上拉布呢個問題。

143
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,120
係未能夠結束嘅。

144
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:42,700
好似昨天或者過去二讀嘅討論裏面咧，好多泛民嘅議員係講一啲觀點啊，時空論啊，誒就係話啊，本來呢個法案咧個內容係有進進步嘅，咁但係唔好意思啦啊，放喺今時今日咧社會氣氛唔好，咁所以咧又要再即係再再加。

145
00:39:42,700 --> 00:40:02,710
一啲嘅修訂去保障，有啲人又講對人不對事。昨天係李長議員十幾分鐘嘅發言咧，同個法案有關嘅可能得一兩分鐘，全部都係講我唔信梁振英政府，所以唔好搞。咁所以喺呢啲噉嘅思維底下，整一個專責委員會係咪真係可以收集共識，完成到個報告？

146
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,400
告咧！

147
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:18,080
咁如果真係令到我哋有信心要支持一個專責委員會，因為大家都想有共識，而唔係最終就留令到呢個法案根本通過唔到，或者喺呢屆會期完成唔到咧？

148
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:37,810
誒，我相信咧，佢哋係要釋出善意，即係話凡民要釋出善意。第一就係撤回你個修正案，你而家全體委員會裡面所提倡嗰幾個修正案，不如撤回咗先啦，喺專責委員會裡面部提出嚟咯。第二咧，喺討論嘅期間唔好拉布，唔好點人數。

149
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:58,100
咁第三咧，究竟你哋想唔想佢過咧？嗱，好老實講，喺二讀嘅發言裏面咧，我有聽嘅最熟悉呢個法案嘅議員咧有幾位，其中兩位，譬如陳志全或者黃毓民，你問佢其實咧通過修訂案好啊，定係不如唔好搞？

150
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:18,110
唔好過仲好咧，其實佢哋一定係選擇後者嘅，即係話最熟悉嘅法案嘅，而最中意拉布嘅議員根本唔想過。點樣能夠達到咗共識咧？所以咧，即係昨天提出呢個動議嘅泛民議員就話：呢個係一個出路。我覺得呢個係一個兜路，繼續拉布。

151
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,460
所以咧，本人咧係完全噉樣嚟反對呢個嘅動議嘅。多謝。副主席。

152
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,550
多謝主席。

153
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:35,770
頭先，鄧家彪議員咧就再三強調，即係無論你擺喺專責委員會好，擺喺呢一個全體委員會都好咧，都係繼續拉布。

154
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:43,130
但係，我想指出一點就係，今日我哋面對嘅問題係咩嘢先？

155
00:41:43,410 --> 00:42:01,200
我哋面對嘅問題就係喺版權修訂條例裏邊，泛民主派同政府同建制派當然有一個唔同嘅睇法啦。我哋對於喺呢一個版權條例裏邊，對於呢個係啊網民好，對於言論自由嘅約束，我哋有擔心，呢個事實嚟嘅。

156
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:13,120
但係同樣情況，大家再睇一睇呢個事務委員會係咪？即係呢個委員會係唔係有無限嘅時間可以畀大家一路係喺度做落去咧？噉樣樣。

157
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,300
客觀上。

158
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,910
正如阿梁愛章議員講，我哋喺眼前邊嘅要面對嘅問題。

159
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:35,640
已經展開咗嘅係法案委員會嘅數目有十十三個，仲有好多嘅議案一路嘅上緊嚟。呢啲議案咧都希望喺今個會期裏邊咧係能夠完成有關嘅討論，同埋咧係通過到立法。

160
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:45,810
我明明白大家嘅諗法就係話最好咧，就大家靜靜地過曬關，咁咧就好快脆就可以通過關係議案嘅討論。

161
00:42:46,230 --> 00:43:01,440
但係版權條例嘅爭議係咁大嘅時間，無論你話係受咩原因都好，客觀嘅事實就係社會對於版權條例係有好明確嘅唔同意見。

162
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,630
當係噉樣樣嘅話。

163
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,940
泛民主派，我哋係有個選擇。

164
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:18,770
我哋嘅選擇就係覺得，我哋要盡我哋嘅能力，盡我哋嘅努力咧，去令到呢一個版權條例呢個版權修訂條例咧係有迴旋嘅空間。

165
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,320
呢個就係我哋努力嘅方向所在。

166
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:40,090
我哋都因為透過，因為有呢個目標，亦都理解到今次嘅喺呢個委員會里邊，喺呢個立法會里邊，政府亦都有佢個壓力。佢個壓力就係佢有好多好重要嘅法案，而且呢啲重要嘅法案亦都有佢嘅時限喺裏邊嘅。

167
00:43:40,490 --> 00:44:00,500
因此，我哋希望政府係能夠係作出一個係回應，包括咗係可能係接受泛民主派嘅係修訂，又或者係將草案撤回，從長計議，又或者希望能夠呼籲到喺在座嘅係建制派嘅同事同。

168
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,760
同意何秀蘭議員嘅修訂，擺專責委員會。

169
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:11,380
目標好簡單，其實就係希望喺個平衡嘅時間裏邊咧，係同時處理兩部分嘅問題。

170
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,030
第一個部分嘅問題，最有爭議嘅係版權條例，放咗專責委員會裏邊繼續討論。

171
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,480
等於今日你喺呢個情況。

172
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:27,710
但係同一時間，其他嘅政府法案就可以按時間表咧，係提上嚟，加入討論。

173
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,220
咁呢一個平衡嘅諗法，其實，

174
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,020
就係為。

175
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,530
我哋呢一咁爭議嘅法案咧，係提供咗更多嘅時間去處理問題。

176
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:55,440
我冇講過就係你多時間唔等於大家嘅爭議能夠即時減少，但起碼畀咗空間大家去解決呢個問題，而且能夠令到係喺後邊一路排緊隊嘅其他法案咧，能夠可以咧係按秩序噉樣上翻嚟去傾。

177
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:10,200
我得呢一個咧，正好就係當我哋考慮要解決一個問題嘅時候，係用緊一種好直線嘅思維，定係我哋會覺得，因為要解決問題，然後我哋係可以用各種唔同嘅思路去諗。

178
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:18,350
其實，政府係面對緊一個係政而家所有嘅係法案排緊隊嘅法案懸崖嘅問題。

179
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,400
呢個法案原來有問題。

180
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:31,050
係咪唔需要理會嘅咧？定係你覺得去到呢個誒施政報告嘅辯論之後嘅財政預算案嘅辯論之後嘅其他嘅法案嘅辯論？

181
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,690
大家根本就唔需要理會，喺呢度有得去繼續。

182
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:44,090
用冗長嘅審議嘅方式介入處理，就可以有足夠嘅時間解決咧。個答案好明顯唔係，睇梁繼昌講咗。

183
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:50,530
全體委員會嘅討論裏邊，我哋好自然地已經有相當多嘅係議員嘅修訂。

184
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:58,540
議員嘅修訂好，政府嘅修訂好，呢啲修訂我哋都會有好多冗長嘅發言，呢啲發言你中意聽？

185
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,940
係意見，你唔中意聽就變成拉布。

186
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:22,230
係嘛咁？但係今日呢個議會，大家有冇好認真去聽對方嘅立論同埋意見咧？我自己嘅觀感就係多數都係大家都係你可以咁講，大家都係個立場擺咗喺度咧，就儘量係運用議事程序咧去處理，希望令到自己嘅立場能夠得到彰顯。呢個。

187
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,080
事實嚟嘅。

188
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,350
但係呢個都係翻翻一個最老實嘅情況，就係我哋嘅政治制度本身。

189
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,090
係唔能夠讓我哋有一個合理嘅公平咁解決問題嘅平台啊嘛，所以你先出現一個噉嘅現象。

190
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,540
所以我成日我想講嘅點就係。

191
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,740
係。

192
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:52,270
何秀蘭議員嘅係議案，希望能夠成立專責委員會。最重要嘅目標，最重要嘅目標，其實我冇諗過係可以慳到時間，但係喺平衡時空裏邊咧，係可以讓。

193
00:46:52,930 --> 00:47:05,440
咁爭議嘅議案同正常嘅係其他排緊隊嘅議案咧，係能夠同步進行，令到我哋有雙重雙倍嘅時間咧去處理有關嘅問題。因為如果唔係嘅話，咁其實就等於。

194
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,130
主席要求點算法定人數？

195
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,460
唔知話要。

196
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,110
多，主席。

197
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,750
誒得唔得住啊？

198
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,650
胡志偉議員。

199
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,840
請議員返回座位。

200
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,330
我知委員。

201
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,340
多謝主席。

202
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:51,920
我想大家睇一睇咧，我哋而家喺立法會當中一啲好重要嘅法案，嗰個時效咧個時間嘅限制咧，其實相當之嚴重嘅。譬如話，私營骨灰安置所條例嘅草案。

203
00:52:52,200 --> 00:53:03,520
傾咗好耐，但係我哋裏邊咧，其實係透過行政手段咧，去凍結一啲嘅係即係私人骨灰庵嘅堪位，令到佢咧係要遵從呢個法例嘅規定。

204
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,410
又譬如，我哋有金融機構豁廕處置機制嘅條例草案。

205
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:19,040
係當我哋面對可能係嚟緊有重大嘅係即係系統性嘅金融機構嘅即係問題嘅時候咧，能夠引用嘅法案。

206
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:39,890
譬如話，東區海底隧道法例括弧修訂條例草案係牽涉到當呢一個嘅係嗯，第七號東隧嗰個嘅係營建造營運同埋而家個專營權屆滿嘅時候，究竟我哋有冇法例嘅依據去繼續收取費用咧？其實呢啲係好多嘅一啲時限咧。

207
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:44,310
係限制住我哋喺呢一個立法會裏邊嘅。

208
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:54,730
法例審議嘅過程裏邊嘅限制同約束，當然仲未計就係話中間牽涉到嘅財政預算案同埋呢一個施政報告嘅辯論。

209
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:15,140
其實呢啲都係好重要嘅課題，而啲課題咧係好肯定咧，係會有佢嗰個時間嘅約束。所以其實我覺得兩個方法咧，去嘗試係為我哋呢一個討論擺緊條草案咧，係提供更多嘅時間。第一個就係當然可能好似黃國議員講啦，我哋可以係。

210
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:31,640
無限嘅延展嚇，廿四小時日以繼夜、夜以繼日去討論，令到咧就大家就喺呢度咧係度過我哋，無論係即係過年好咩時間都好。咁呢個係其中一個方法，令到我哋係有好多好多嘅時間咧去應對。

211
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:51,970
另一個方法就係頭先我哋講，我哋擺咗專責委員會裏邊咧，係平衡地咧係有多一個嘅係機構咧，係去審議相關嘅法案。咁當然，今日鄧家彪議員講到就係話喺嗰個委員會裏邊嗰個嘅討論方式、個報告翻嚟要再審議，翻嚟係要再面對。

212
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,790
成個議會，諸如類似嘅問題，咁但係。

213
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,260
我自己覺得。

214
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:11,960
作為一個議會，作為一個政府，我哋係咪要諗點樣解決一個問題，還是我哋只係好善性噉樣諗？就係我人多係嘛？總之我搭齊馬坐定定喺度嘅話咧，我就贏㗎啦。

215
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,680
如果係噉樣諗嘢嘅話，其實呢個呢個議會就只不過就變成就係。

216
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:31,660
政府嘅一個橡皮圖章，我哋大家都冇同心合力去諗方法咧，去令到政府同社會嘅矛盾咧，係能夠有一個解決嘅路徑。

217
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:33,970
主席。

218
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,810
其實我覺得。

219
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:45,750
霍生蘭議員所提嘅一個專責委員會嘅方式咧，畢竟就係為解決呢個問題咧，係諗方法、找出路。

220
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,770
但係好可惜。

221
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:56,500
我哋聽到在座嘅建制派嘅同事，好快脆已經將呢一個問題咧係閂咗後門，覺得唔需要。

222
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:12,680
事實上，你睇下，其實都唔係嘅。林鄭月娥司長喺早前嘅專訪裏邊已經講咗，呢個法案係會影響到即係政府有其他嘅係施政嘅問題，佢有咁講過。因此，佢都覺得就係話咧。

223
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,740
撤回都可能係一個要諗嘅方式，都唔定。

224
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,110
啊！我又見到。

225
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,360
黃國建，工聯會嘅黃國健。

226
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:30,710
幾個建制派嘅同事都講咗，就係話，即係其實撤回議案唔係一個咧，係。

227
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:39,740
會好大影響到成個社會嘅問題，因為個法例本身仍然存在。大家唔好搞錯，今日呢個議案。

228
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:52,660
本質上，本質上係原有法例下邊都會規範嘅東西，不過係喺原有法例裏邊，因為處理唔到係串流嘅問題。

229
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:59,660
處理唔到喺嗰個電子平台上邊嘅一個係版權侵權嘅行為。

230
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:12,270
而呢個侵權嘅行為，事實上喺舊嘅法例都唔係處理唔到。不過佢係需要版權持有人咧，係用仲好巨大嘅能力同能量咧去制止。

231
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:13,960
咁因此。

232
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,450
新嘅法例，事實上係令到呢一種嘅係即係。

233
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:25,520
舉證侵權嘅門檻咧，係大大嘅降低咗，對於版權持有人嚟講。

234
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,750
但係。

235
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:32,220
個法例唔過，或者撤回，或者再審議。

236
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:46,760
係仍然有佢個法例本身擺咗喺前邊，係可以運用可以應用。當然，如果再加上呢一個嘅係即係不成日使用電腦嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅條條例嘅話咧，咁更加就可以有兩把刀擺喺前邊添啦。

237
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,020
咁所以。

238
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,950
個法案撤回唔過，其實唔係一個咧，係。

239
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,680
死人冧樓嘅事情。

240
00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:02,490
但係其他嘅法案，因為排隊，因為塞車嘅關係上唔到嚟咧，其實係問題嚟嘅。

241
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:12,100
咁所以何秀蘭議員嘅説法就係我哋將呢一個問題放咗落去專責委員會裏邊，繼續喺裏邊糾纏好，繼續喺裏邊咧係爭議好。

242
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:32,620
而讓其他嘅法案可以上。第一，試想下翻轉頭就係，如果唔係噉樣樣嘅話，梁啟昌計嗰條數，一百個鐘嘅辯論係咩意思咧？噉樣樣係講緊嚟緊嘅，我哋有即係每一日每一次嘅會期，九點到十點，九點到八點，係十一個鐘頭。咁換言之咧。

243
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,970
就大概大概，仲要嚟多五個星期嘅辯論。

244
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:44,860
先至完成曬呢一個嘅係即係誒誒全體委員會階段嘅審議。試想下五個星期。

245
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:56,870
跟住向後推嘅係咩事咧？財政預算案、施政報告，甚至係其他嘅啲好重要嘅法案，噉樣嘅做法對個社會又係咪公道嘅做法咧？

246
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:17,170
所以我嘅發言咧，其實支持何秀蘭議員嘅係成立專責委員會嘅動議，我都好希望大家從呢一個角度去諗。既然大家成日都講啦，我哋想擺想揾多啲時間出嚟處理有關嘅問題，爭議嘅問題係咁多嘅時候，除咗係用呢個方式去處理之外，剩翻嘅可能就真係。

247
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,880
大家廿四小時凍咗喺度，喺度過年，係咪呢個就我哋選項咧？

248
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:42,240
各位市民、各位委員嘅各位我哋嘅同事，其實大家諗一諗，諗一諗，究竟我哋可以有咩方法去解決眼前嘅問題，而令到我哋有更多嘅時間呢？係去處理相關嘅議案。我覺得作為擺專責委員會里邊，既能夠係。

249
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:55,460
讓我哋個委員會有充足嘅時間去審議，重新去吸納翻喺社會上邊嘅不同嘅意見，亦都正如局長講，再三都有講過，所有嘅修訂嘅議案，其實方向上邊。

250
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:02,220
政府同埋版權持有人都覺得係可以考慮嘅方向，只不過就覺得嚟得太過。

251
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:22,510
緊逼嘅時候咧，唔可以喺呢個階段接納。如果噉樣樣嘅話，我哋咪更加應該有責任為呢一個咁緊逼嘅事情係買一啲時間，然後讓大家能夠尋找到共識，共同處理有關嘅問題咧。我覺得噉樣樣先一個負責任嘅行為同埋表現，亦都令到咧係喺後邊塞緊車嘅其他法案咧。

252
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:35,590
能夠有佢原來嘅時間表咧，係繼續提上呢個立法會上面，係繼續辯論，繼續咧係審議，而令到咧係相關嘅法案所帶嚟嘅後遺症咧，係唔會影響到我哋嘅社會。

253
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:56,930
主席，我喺呢一度咧，就再一次，亦都好懇請咧，係各位委員咧，係認真去思考相關嘅問題，亦都希望咧，大家係能夠諗如何能夠令到呢個法案咧，係能夠喺平衡嘅時空裏邊咧，係得到討論，令到我哋足夠嘅時間咧，去處理有關嘅問題。多謝主席，黃毓民議員。

254
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,210
主席。

255
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:18,220
本人要求點算發電？範國威議員，當我未示意你講嘢嘅時候，請你保持肅靜。主席，因為你經常耷低頭喺度用手機。我係見到你，我見到你。剛才試過兩次。我係見到黃毓民企喺度咧。範國威議員，請你坐低。

256
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,310
我冇示意你講嘢。

257
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:24,200
你説傳召議員翻嚟。

258
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,870
好在唔講。

259
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,240
希望我。

260
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,970
請各位同事翻回座位。

261
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,180
黃毓民議員。

262
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,480
多謝。

263
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:47,420
根據《議事規則》第五十五括弧一括弧四A條，將法案付委於專責委員會，係港英殖民地議會嘅產物。

264
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:51,150
大家可以參考立法局會議常規第四十三條。

265
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,890
願意係誒，黃永文議員，你有冇帶？

266
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,310
冇咗咁閪。

267
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,350
咪個麥黑咗。

268
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:19,800
主席，根據議事規則第五十五括弧一細A條，將法案附委於專責委員會，係港英殖民地議會嘅產物。

269
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:30,830
大家可以參考立法局會議常規第四十三條，原意係讓議會更詳細研究同埋審議複雜法案同埋相關嘅修正案。

270
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:51,150
其實將法案附委於專責委員會同中止待續議案，同樣都係議案。議員嘅議案，除非建制派嘅議員改變初衷，否則一分組投票之下根本無望通過。儘管如此，本席亦都支持議案。除咗開中名義係因為拉布之外，

271
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,690
仲有以下嘅理由。

272
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:11,170
無論將法案附委於專責委員會，議案最終能否通過，佢辯論過程咧一定進一步拖延。二零一四年版權修訂條例草案嘅立法程序，因此議案最終是否獲得通過係無關宏旨。

273
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:16,180
但係好多發言嘅議員，包括啲泛民議員，佢話唔係拉布。

274
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:30,280
其實根據議事規則第五十五括弧一細B條，只要主席閣下認為法案會特別惠及或者反之，特別影響某人、某社團。

275
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:38,820
就可以將呢個法案附委於專責委員會，噉就無需繼續辯論同埋表決。

276
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:53,080
除非大會主席好享受呢啲吹雲嘅鐘聲，否則佢都可以考慮運用《議事規則》第五十五括弧一括弧細B條賦予嘅權力，突破僵局。

277
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,510
主席。

278
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:01,560
過去有膽識展布，其實佢都應該有化解僵局嘅勇氣。

279
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:07,320
主席早前接受傳媒查詢嘅時候，我講係曾主席。

280
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,740
特區政府成立以來。

281
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:15,720
即係好似噉樣嘅情況底下成立專責委員會係沒有先例。

282
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,180
秘書處正在研究有關嘅程序。

283
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:40,470
主席進而表示，考慮當前嘅情況，將法案付委於專責委員會嘅議案必然涉及政治考慮，而且專責委員會未必能夠喺本屆立法會期內完成商議。假如二零一四年版權修訂條例草案未及喺二零一六年。

284
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:51,470
年七月十五日，本屆立法會休會前完成所有嘅立法程序，條例草案將會生效。下一個會期要重新再嚟啦，局長。

285
01:18:51,800 --> 01:19:11,810
議事規則第七十八括弧四條定明，委員會如果認為未能夠喺任期完結前完成研究有關事宜同埋法案，就必須如實向立法會報告。根據第七十八括弧五條，專責委員會須於立法會嘅每屆任。

286
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:13,820
任期完結之前解散。

287
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:28,590
因此，專責委員會必須趕及喺二零一六年七月前完成商議法案，令到法案可以喺七月十五日前恢復同埋完成全體委員會審議同埋三讀嘅程序。

288
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:40,090
專責委員會喺港英時期最初叫做特別委員會，一九二九年修訂會議常規之後，就改稱專責委員會。

289
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:50,530
早年立法局未有法案委員會嘅制度，立法會、立法局若果認為有需要，法案可以交畀呢個特別委員會審議。

290
01:19:50,810 --> 01:20:10,820
後來喺行政立法非官守議員辦事處嘅非正式架構底下咧，就設有專案小組。而呢個專案小組就係法案委員會同事務委員會嘅前身。譬如一九八五年六月通過嘅《立法局權力及特權條例》，喺審議階段咧就係附委畀。

291
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:30,830
喺專責小組審議，最後專案小組提出多個修訂動議，得到政府嘅接納，並且提出修正案。專案小組同後來嘅法案委員會就大大減低將法案附委於專責委員會嘅需要，所以近年基本上就冇將法案附委。

292
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,970
委於專責委員會嘅情況出現。

293
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:43,410
因此，專責委員會佢不是新生事物。此外，喺一九九七年以來，除咗第三屆，

294
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:49,070
第一屆嘅立法會都曾經召開專責委員會。

295
01:20:49,810 --> 01:21:01,950
誒第一屆就係一九九八年調查呢個赤鱲角新香港國際機場喺一九九八年七月六日開始運作嘅時候出現嘅問題嘅原委同埋有關事宜專責委員會。

296
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:10,210
當時有十三個委員，第二屆就係二零零三年公營房屋建築問題專責委員會有十五個委員。

297
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:29,490
喺呢一屆仲有二零零三年調查政府與醫院管理局對嚴重性呼吸系統綜合症爆發嘅處理方法專責委員會，總共有十一名委員。第四屆就係二零零八年調查有關梁展文先生離職後從事工作的事宜專責委員會，有十二名委員。

298
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:50,880
另外喺同一年，二啊同一屆喺二零一二年研究梁振英先生以西九龍填海區概念計劃比賽評審團成員身份，在該比賽中的參與及相關事宜專責委員會總共有十二名委員。第五屆就係二零一三年調查湯顯明先生任職廉政專員期間。

299
01:21:50,880 --> 01:22:10,890
外訪籌助鬼贈及收受禮物事宜專責委員會，總共有十三名委員。另外，喺二零一四年調查廣深港高速鐵路香港段建造工程疑案嘅背景及原委嘅專責委員會。嗱，雖然上述專責委員會主要係展開調查言訊，而唔係為法案而設。

300
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:30,900
咁但係咧，都大同小異。根據慣例咧，專責委員會嘅委員人數，佢冇特定嘅限制，相對自由。人選方面，相信亦都可以由內務委員會透過協商或者選舉決定，再向大會主席作出建議。《議事規則》第七十九括弧一條已經有規定，為法案。

301
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:42,970
而成立嘅專責委員會，只限於商議立法會所交付嘅法案同埋有關修正案。第七十九括弧七條，為委員會審議法案就定出具體嘅程序。

302
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,660
過去幾年。

303
01:22:44,940 --> 01:23:04,950
財政預算案即係撥款條例草案嘅立法程序咧，一般要到五月底先至能夠完成三讀。二零一六一七年嘅財政預算案會喺二零一六年嘅二月十七日公佈，在此之前，立法會大會只係剩翻兩個會期，分別係一月廿七同埋二月三號。

304
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:21,580
因此，將法案附委於專責委員會嘅議案，就算未獲通過，亦都消耗會議時間，令到條例草案可以喺公佈財政預算案之前完成立法程序嘅機會更加渺茫。主席。

305
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:42,440
我諗局長都要考慮下呢樣嘢，所以琴日我喺議讀辯論裏邊提出，政府應該立即撤回條例草案。呢個係一個政治現實，唔到你願唔願意，包括今天呢個副委嘅動議係嘛？你哋唔講嘢都唔緊要，隔離有人講嘢，一定有人響衝係嘛？

306
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:51,490
得翻兩個會期，呢個一個政治現實。我唔知點解六八九呢條友名還不靈，係咪自己攞嚟衰？你以為攬炒啊？攬死你自己！

307
01:23:52,160 --> 01:24:06,280
你可以儘管批評啲人拉布啊，佢又可以話我唔係拉布噉，冇意義嘅。基本上個現實就係仲翻兩個會期，係嘛？所以我係開宗明義承認係拉布，我講多十五分鐘，又幫你有上下堂。

308
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,110
今日。

309
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:13,730
即係好簡單啫嚇，兩個會期噉你。

310
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,950
即係喺公佈預算案，即係。

311
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:28,510
前完成立法程序嘅機會點會存在啫？係嘛？所以條例草案要可能延至六月財政預算案完成三讀之後先能恢復，但係嗰陣時咧。

312
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:42,030
又有好多法案排山倒海而嚟，呢一屆嘅會期亦都行將結束。咁於是就令我諗翻起二零一二年呢度鬼哭神號嘅拉布，小弟係始作俑者。

313
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:59,940
近日落水參與拉布，即係我哋睇到好多泛民主派議員。你睇而家我講嘢，得一定有喺度，係嘛？響鐘嘅時候冇人，我覺得好開心。但開風氣不為師，成功不必在我，功成一定有我。呢個師徒老人講嘅係嘛？

314
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:20,860
即係我係覺得好感慨。如果二零一零一二年政府強推替補機制，泛民又好似今日咁去配合，利用以前規則嘅空間作出抗爭。不過何秀娜又中止代助，又附位動議。喂，嗰個替補機制點會通過啊？係咪長毛唔使去坐監啦？

315
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,540
王楊達又唔使去坐監啦，啱唔啱啊？係咪？

316
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,510
雖然佢哋後知後覺，係嘛？但係。

317
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:42,950
經此一役，再遇惡法，泛民好難揾藉口不參加拉布。相信呢個政府當局始料不及，我就喺度食花生，眯眯嘴咁笑。本席在此都奉勸各位。

318
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:50,300
不要動輒修改議事規則，自我淹沒，尤其是立法會仲未實施普選之前。

319
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:51,960
老實講。

320
01:25:53,150 --> 01:26:01,680
殖民地留畀我哋其中一個比較重要嘅遺產，就係呢個優良嘅議會制度。

321
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:14,300
既然局長回應議員二讀發言嘅時候承諾修法後會對版權條例作出檢討，噉你點解唔直住專責委員會先作檢討，以釋放善意，化解僵局？

322
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:34,620
政務司司長林鄭月娥都表示喺必要時會顧全大局。二零一四年版權修訂條例草案能否趕及喺公佈財政預算案之前完成立法程序？相信政府心裏有數。如果將法案附委於專責委員會，政府當局就可以喺六月再恢復議讀。

323
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:45,110
同時停止拉布，反對條例嘅草案，議員不必再用點算發敵人數，建制派議員亦都無需擔心流會，立法會亦都可以處理其他事項。

324
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,180
最後。

325
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,700
我要喺呢度。

326
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:59,710
提出就副委於專責委員呢個動議。

327
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:01,450
宗子代續。

328
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,590
主席。

329
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,620
你聽我講埋個理由，你可以做裁決。

330
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:10,480
裁決唔到就問下曾主席，問下啲秘書。

331
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:17,130
主席多次提醒議員，將法案附位於專責委員會嘅議案發言嚟睇。

332
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:31,810
可以見到，議員對根據第五十一、五十五括弧一細A條可能通過嘅專責委員會唔係好瞭解，仍然未搞清楚專責委員會審議同全體委員會審議嘅差異。

333
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:52,100
支持條例草案通過，議員經常以法案喺立法會大會已經有足夠討論為由，反對之前嘅終止待續議案，同埋今次嘅專責委員會議案。嗱，呢啲睇法個謬誤係在於喺立法會大會上邊所謂足夠討論，根本係無助解決現時嘅政治僵局。

334
01:27:52,370 --> 01:28:01,090
因為大會或者全體委員會上邊，議員只能夠針對議案作出辯論，冇辦法對議案作出作出修改。

335
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:19,330
如果希望議案有機會作出修改，只有兩個辦法。其一就係中止待續之後，讓政府當局作出修改，然後再交付立法會大會重新審議。但係呢個方法咧，喺日前嘅表決之中已經被否決。

336
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,080
日前嗰個中止代續係針對易讀嘅中止代續。

337
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:41,990
其二係透過專責委員會呢個機制，但係議員對於現階段唯一可以對法案作出修改嘅機制又唔係好瞭解。即使喺主席閣下接受媒體嘅訪問時候，亦都表示由於冇先例，所以會先同法律顧問討論。

338
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:50,070
由此可見，上至主席，下至議員，對於專責委員會副委仍然係一頭霧水。

339
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:56,960
唔好話，仲未搞清楚專責委員會去解決未搞清楚嘅版權條例。

340
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:17,250
將法案附委專責委員會嘅議案能否通過二零一四年版權條例草案，都冇辦法喺財政預算案之前完成立法程序。既然如此，我哋先爭取時間，讓主席同埋議員詳細瞭解專責委員會嘅職能，商討有關嘅細節，然後。

341
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:37,260
先審議是否成立專責委員會，何況根據政府公佈嘅資料，本立法年度仍有十八項法案尚待處理，因此現階段討論是否需要專責委員會並冇多大嘅意願，不如先讓路畀其他法案去處理。即使何秀蘭議員冇動。

342
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:50,950
同意將法案附委專責委員會二零一四年版權條例修訂草案喺未來兩星期根本冇辦法完成立法程序，政府當局為咗讓路畀你個財政預算案，不論以各種方式都好。

343
01:29:51,340 --> 01:30:11,350
又或者先行國治二零一四年版權修訂條例草案。既然政府當局遲早都要讓路畀財政預算案，本席為咗大局著想，計下數呢一次嘅終止待續議案辯論同埋表決要兩至三日嘅時間。現階段提出終止待續議案，就保證。

344
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:29,970
唔會妨礙財政預算案嘅如期進行。基於上述原因，主席，本席根據議事規則第四十豁胡一條，就何秀蘭議員提出將法案附委於專責委員會嘅議案動議，延即終止待續嘅議案，請主席裁決。

345
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:47,260
王煜民意員係根據議事規則第四十括弧一條動議一項議案，即係將根據議事規則第五十五一括弧A條動議進行嘅議案辯論終止待續。

346
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:58,070
喺議事規則第五十五條第一A款嘅規定，二讀法案嘅議案如獲通過，即法案即告付。

347
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:04,100
委於一個全體委員會，除非立法會通過議案。

348
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:10,580
將法案附委一個專責委員會，我認為依一項程序。

349
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:24,760
係一項程序議案，讓立法會決定是否將條例草案一如既往賦予全體委員會處理，即或賦予一個專責委員會處理。

350
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:40,570
若從呢個議案嘅辯論終止待續，立法會便無從決定喺程序上如何繼續處理條例草案，所以我不會批准就呢項辯論提出終止待續。王國興議。

351
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:50,080
我講咗，我不會批准。

352
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,650
主席，主席，我我頭先講咗。

353
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,900
黃毓民議員，請黃毓民議員。

354
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,450
黃毓民議員，請你坐低。

355
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:07,460
請你停止發言，坐低。

356
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:16,090
黃旭文議員，若哥你唔坐低，我就會裁決你係行為不檢，請你坐低。

357
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:28,530
我已經頭先係講曬，我已經頭先係講曬，我已經講曬理由同埋主席嘅裁決係不容辯論。黃國興議員。

358
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:33,450
署理主席。

359
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,000
你做得啱。

360
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:44,350
署理主席黃毓民議員剛才嘅發言咧，係十分之精彩。毓民，你唔好行住咧，贊你啊！

361
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,200
你有種承認拉布？

362
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:50,960
你有種。

363
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:59,400
不過，我又再談你，為山九仞，功虧一壘，都係處理主席呢一個你。

364
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:20,500
你提出終止的終止，其實都係換湯不換藥，拉布再拉布，搶奪泛民嗰個光環。你呢一個泛民咁解啫嘛，所以我都話梁君彥處理主席咧啊，呢次就英明啦。

365
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,490
英明過你。

366
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:30,500
主席，何秀蘭議員提出嚟嘅五十五條一A。

367
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,960
講咗好多好多嘅理由。

368
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:46,720
好遲嚇係哇！唔想嘥咁多時間啦，又咁爭議，又冇咗係決定，又將近，亦都會期又冇啦。

369
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:50,090
因此，交去專責委員會。

370
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,130
其實就好虛偽。

371
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:58,580
我諗何語言都介意我批評個虛偽嘅。

372
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:03,970
佢直情咧就冇黃毓民噉樣有種。

373
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:13,820
坦白可愛，拉布咪拉布咯，使乜兜兜轉轉又唔認拉布啫？喺度悲天憫人。

374
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,010
哼。

375
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:25,960
其實黃毓民同我立場係唔同，但係黃毓民咧嘅發言咧就字字鏗鏘，一針見血。

376
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:35,290
我相信咧，王玉文踢爆咗工黨何秀蘭呢個古惑招，路人皆見。

377
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,190
石上面。

378
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:39,900
現在。

379
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:46,340
二讀辯論已經通過，應當即刻進入去全體委員會嘅階段。

380
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:51,000
不應當交去什麼一個專責委員會。

381
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:54,450
其實黃毓民頭嗰十分鐘嘅發言咧。

382
01:34:54,760 --> 01:35:11,660
無論從法律嘅角度、從歷史嘅角度、同例子嘅角度，以至從泛民本質嘅角度，四個方面全部踢爆曬，所以我覺得無需再沉醉。

383
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:19,620
一如好似馬逢國語言引用《無間道》裏面嘅台詞。

384
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,580
三年又三年。

385
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,800
有幾多個十年？

386
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,280
如果，

387
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:38,420
好似泛民，好似工黨，好似何秀蘭，話呢個係網絡廿三條喺我哋頭上一把刀。哇！分分鐘把刀叫嚟，命都冇嘅。

388
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,880
咁緊張，咁危險。

389
01:35:41,390 --> 01:36:01,400
工黨嘅何秀蘭議員，阿李卓仁，你望住我都係咁講㗎啦。我唔會轉彎換角，好直率嘅。噉你哋就唔好中途退出啦。你係要中途退出係咪？你何秀蘭中途退出，即係呢個唔係網絡廿三條啦。即係你哋都覺得冇乜爭議。

390
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:08,110
唔需要再拗，十年講咗啦，而家都應該嗱嗱聲落雨收柴啦。

391
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,010
但係唔係喎？

392
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:22,100
啊！喺呢個條例審議期間，有網絡戰士嘈一嘈，你哋當堂腳軟，看風使裏，即刻改變。

393
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:29,860
其實何秀蘭議員只不過話畀我哋知，佢嘅做法係變色龍。

394
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,940
何秀蘭呢樣？

395
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:46,400
我請黃國興議員翻查記錄，我幾時退出呢個草案審議委員會？我蘇蘭議員呢個唔係虧情問題，即係我請佢澄清。

396
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:53,380
你澄清嘅就等議員發完言，你只可以起身講澄清。黃國興議員請你繼續。

397
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,600
問題。

398
01:36:55,060 --> 01:37:00,570
頭先黃國興話：，我未叫你講嘢，李昌仁議員。

399
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:19,030
唔講埋嗰啲咩虛偽啊、變色龍，亦都係根本完全係冒犯緊係議員嘅，所以我要裁決。呢個唔係規程問題，請你坐低。唔係呢個係規程問題啊！咩規程？冒犯議員係唔得㗎嘛？喺呢個議會、議事廳裏邊，你唔識嘅咩？我唔認為呢個規程問題。黃偉明議員，請你繼續。

400
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:25,560
王主席嘅裁決係不容辯論，請你坐低，王國興議員。

401
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,270
我再次。

402
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,910
喺今日嘅席上面。

403
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:35,090
多謝黃毓民議員。

404
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:38,400
日前嘅發言，今日嘅發言。

405
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:45,340
因為佢踢爆咗何秀蘭嘅醜態同埋本質。

406
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,070
踢爆工黨！

407
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:51,680
嘅醜陋嘅真面目。

408
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,240
主席。

409
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,200
其實。

410
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,260
呢個就係拉布。

411
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,860
呢個就係浪費。

412
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:09,030
所以我形容佢提出按照。

413
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:16,640
呢個五十五條一A呢個噉樣嘅做法係極之可恥。

414
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:19,230
我一定反對。

415
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:21,840
主席。

416
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:27,250
喺二讀辯論同埋去討論呢一個噉樣嘅。

417
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:29,590
副議嘅議題嘅時候。

418
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,260
民主黨嘅黃碧雲。

419
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:37,360
琴日嘅發言真係令我大開眼界。

420
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:47,140
佢好錫我哋啲建制派議員啊！你哋好攰啊！你哋成日伏坐啊，唔好坐啦，叫政府收班啦！

421
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,140
剛才。

422
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:53,280
民主黨嘅其中一位發言。

423
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:57,580
孤隱其名啦，因為佢我都唔係想得罪佢。

424
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:17,870
就話嚇誒，仲有十幾條法案要等住，唔好阻住啦。仲有好多民生問題要處理㗎。而家懸崖啦，而家咧就係去到咧係要墮崖啦，又改咗啊，東隧法例又改咗骨。

425
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:21,580
灰暗，哇！幾大體。

426
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,370
幾錫我哋啲建制派？

427
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:29,510
幾愛全香港市民，幾有愛心啊！阿胡志偉。

428
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:34,660
係咪真嘅咧？我想問一問各位。

429
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,200
梗係唔係真㗎啦？

430
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:43,010
棕樹根，你講錯啦，唔係少少，係假。

431
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,250
因為。

432
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:48,120
我覺得佢哋醜陋就醜陋在咧。

433
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:51,790
你係做綁匪，你就認啦。

434
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,570
你喺度要挾，你就認啦。

435
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,400
你又唔認？

436
01:39:57,790 --> 01:40:06,270
如果你係好似王玉文議員所講，我而家就係拉布，我就係用議員嘅權力，我就係要綁架嘅議會。

437
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:08,860
噉樣。

438
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,910
光明女郎，OK。

439
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:15,380
你嘅政治立場，你嘅政治手段。

440
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:19,800
光明正大，我冇意見。

441
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:20,950
但係。

442
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:24,700
你哋狡猾在可恥啊！

443
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:29,070
狡猾在喪失政治嘅品德。

444
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:35,620
今日《東方日報》功夫茶。

445
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:37,260
有個評論。

446
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:38,710
個題目係。

447
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,510
政客拉布阻議題。

448
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:44,820
誰連工人失生計？

449
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,470
呢個功夫茶寫得好好。

450
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:57,790
一針見血，踢爆泛民保金黨，係咪真係咁錫嘅社會，真係咁愛嘅社會？

451
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,090
就喺呢段裏面。

452
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:02,810
講佢哋嘅拉布嘅結果。

453
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:13,040
現在嘅公務委員會本來有七十二項，涉及咗六百七十五億嘅公共工程開支。

454
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:19,620
喺呢個年度，只係通過咗四項，只係撥款得四點七億。

455
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,480
財委會只係過得兩行兩億。

456
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:26,860
十六個建造業嘅團體。

457
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:39,600
準備發起大遊行請願，批評保金黨犧牲全港業界嘅飯碗，一百四十萬人受影響。

458
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:55,390
黃國興議員，工黨情何以堪啊？黃國興議員，我想請你翻翻嚟呢一個議題，係點解係用五十五一A將呢個反對或者贊成去去全委會？

459
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:57,920
我答處理主席。

460
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:59,910
點解？

461
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:03,470
呢一個五十五一A。

462
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,900
係。

463
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:09,680
有關咧，就係因為拉布兩個字。

464
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:20,900
因此，我就舉出《東方日報》，舉出社會輿論，舉出業界所講嘅例子，就拉布嘅禍害。

465
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:23,300
我哋而家知道。

466
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,710
係真係仲有兩個會期。

467
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:28,520
所以一路我都主張。

468
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:38,660
我希望曾玉成主席，我正式提出過嘅開通宵嚟去處理，日依家日日依家樣踩落去。

469
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:43,040
我想徵告。

470
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:46,030
泛民保金黨嘅議員。

471
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,490
我哋建制派唔怕威脅嘅。

472
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,200
我哋工聯會。

473
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:59,290
只有日以繼夜，夜以繼日。

474
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:02,770
作戰到底嘅議員。

475
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:05,410
絕望。

476
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,530
推太。

477
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,310
嘅議員。

478
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:14,740
我哋建制派。

479
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,400
大家坐喺度，就同你哋奉陪到底。

480
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,060
好冇？

481
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:25,630
處理主席。

482
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,340
係剩翻兩個會期。

483
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,960
但係，我哋唔會被威脅。

484
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,570
我哋不會被綁架。

485
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:44,870
其實，本屆政府梁振英未上台，佢哋已經要佢落台啦。

486
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:52,580
成個立法會呢一屆提咗九次要梁振英落台啦，各種嘅手法。

487
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:59,870
所以而家佢哋提出呢一個，請你坐底線。

488
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:20,670
何秀蘭議員咩批評問題啊？代主席，誒請你誒透過你問下黃國興議員，佢頭先嗰三分鐘嘅發言同五十五一A有咩關係？我已經提咗黃國興議員，而黃國興議員亦都講咗佢嘅理由。黃國興議員，請你繼續。

489
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:23,580
主席。

490
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:26,230
我係不怕打斷嘅。

491
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,870
打轉咧，畀我回一回氣。

492
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,890
現屆政府係打逆境搏。

493
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:39,210
習近平讚賞梁振英。

494
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:43,750
疾風知勁草，板蕩識誠臣。

495
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:45,650
我理解。

496
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:49,420
現屆政府而家面對噉嘅威脅。

497
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,330
應當。

498
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:55,250
強將手下無弱兵。

499
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,030
主席。

500
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,320
我哋睇到。

501
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:05,330
現屆政府都好慘哦，提出各種嘅法例。

502
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,740
其實從佢未上台到到上台一刻。

503
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:11,040
已經係噉樣嘅啦。

504
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,010
大人。

505
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:18,670
我哋睇到，只有含冤受屈。

506
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:21,930
收穫。

507
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:28,410
副總主動辭職嘅麥齊光局長。

508
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:43,660
我哋睇到只有被矮化醜化，但仍然堅持工作嘅吳克儉局長，梁議員，請你翻翻呢個議題好嘛？我而家就係講到佢入獄啦，主主席。

509
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:53,420
只有睇到好打得官道無求膽字大嘅林鄭司長。

510
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:54,990
得嚟！

511
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:58,550
我哋絕冇睇到一個。

512
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:01,130
且白其。

513
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,570
偷康。

514
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,860
嘅局長。

515
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,050
主席。

516
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,800
我相信。

517
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,750
蘇錦良局長。

518
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:19,150
係不怕威脅，不受恐嚇。

519
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:22,020
不會做，投降局長。

520
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,330
唔使煩啊！

521
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:28,780
面對你哋嘅威脅綁架。

522
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:31,300
你唔係我哋呢幾十個人。

523
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,360
你而家係綁架緊全香港市民。

524
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:37,920
主席。

525
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:42,440
而家本來應當立即進入全體委員會階段。

526
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,660
但係，工黨嘅何秀蘭。

527
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:47,920
不顧工人利益。

528
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:51,730
不顧全香港市民。

529
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:57,200
嘅損失一再一拉再拉。

530
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,930
佢哋嘅做法。

531
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:02,320
十分之可恥。

532
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:05,940
主席。

533
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:09,680
而家擺我哋面前兩個會期。

534
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:13,810
路只有兩條。

535
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,170
第一條。

536
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:19,360
就係。

537
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:24,040
我哋成功爭取過到呢條法案。

538
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:26,560
另一條。

539
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:30,030
就係。

540
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:33,450
厭其息鼓。

541
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:35,020
寫八旗。

542
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,170
我哋冇第二條路可以選擇㗎啦。

543
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:46,610
唔係淨係呢個犯案啊，主席係香港冇第二條路啊！

544
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:54,230
我哋能唔能夠喺泛民保金黨嘅威脅底下、綁架底下？

545
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:56,680
我哋建制派一齊同。

546
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,790
一齊認輸。

547
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:02,480
如果係就唔好做呢個議員。

548
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,650
做嚟做乜啦？

549
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:08,250
不如揾梁國雄嚟做蘇局長嘅位。

550
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:12,850
所以。

551
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:15,390
我哋冇得選擇。

552
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:18,130
我哋唯一嘅出路。

553
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,660
只能夠日依家日日依家日。

554
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:23,180
打落去！

555
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:24,820
只有。

556
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:28,760
打落去，絕冇投降嘅，係咪？

557
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,000
係。

558
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:34,960
處理主席。

559
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:38,110
面對噉嘅局勢。

560
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,930
我再一次講。

561
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:47,340
希望主席能夠決心落柯打，通宵開會。

562
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:54,120
廿四小時、四十八小時噉樣開落去，長痛就不如短痛。

563
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,470
為香港人嘅利益。

564
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,320
我哋勇於承擔。

565
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:14,380
為香港市民嘅利益，我哋勇於戰鬥到底。馬逢國議員，誒，我我隔壁嘅範國議員不斷喺度發聲咧，係阻礙我去聽取會議嘅。我，請你。

566
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:21,690
提醒議員，當喺未，我未試去講嘢，請咪請佢哋唔好去發聲。國家旗幟。

567
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:42,660
何秀蘭議員，我請透過你誒請教下黃國興議員，澄清佢剛才發言裏邊嘅一點。我認為係因為懶惰冇做功夫而失實嘅，就係我幾時退出個草案審議委員會，佢可唔可以畀個日子畀我哋？如果佢揾唔到日子。

568
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:50,150
呢句説話係失實嘅話，佢係咪可以收翻咧？黃國興議員，你是否上情請？

569
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,240
國家起源。

570
01:49:54,530 --> 01:50:02,250
主席，我發言係支持何秀蘭議員誒，根據議事規則五十五日A嘅要求，係交一個專責委員會。

571
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:22,540
就主席就喺大家都知道咧，去到今日嘅討論咧，特別我係聽咗阿蘇局長喺琴日嘅發言咧，其實係唔對題嘅，因為去到今日咧，第一大部分嘅香港嘅市民咧，係對於呢一個條例所衍生出嚟嘅一個。

572
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:27,270
誒，相當大嘅一個威脅，特別係對於一啲從事創作。

573
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:47,570
啊！二次創作同埋文化界咧，呢一個疑慮咧係完全未適宜。第二咧就政府真係冇好好地把握咗時間，因為喺過去一個咁長嘅時間咧，其實我哋見唔到咧政府特別蘇錦良咧係會識得利用呢一段時間咧係點樣令到。

574
01:50:47,570 --> 01:51:02,860
呢一個草案特別係有三個係由民主派議員提出嘅修訂咧，係可以得以喺佢嗰個誒修訂入邊咧係可以吸納。其實如果原本政府係能夠咁做嘅話咧，我相信今日喺好多。

575
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:23,150
我哋嘅討論嚇，包括而家我哋喺誒議事廳入邊咧，係要討論要唔要交畀專責委員會咧，係都可以係省免嘅。但係好可惜嚇，即係政府亦都冇係痛定思痛，亦都係冇咧係喺呢一件事入邊咧係誒用一個方法嚟解決。

576
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:37,250
反為咧就係喺一件已經誒傷害咗好多香港人嘅網絡二十三條呢一個條例入邊咧，再灑多啲鹽，就不斷咧去批評嚇，即係其他唔同意政府嘅做法嘅人咧。

577
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:39,590
亦要求點算法定人數？

578
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,480
國家奇緣。

579
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:10,470
請各位同事肅靜。

580
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,420
國家企業。啊，主席係。

581
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:23,090
頭先我講到政府係冇利用到呢一個係適當嘅時候咧，就係將呢件事咧係能夠解決嘅方法，因為。

582
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:43,380
我哋係事實上喺立法會入邊有好多更加重要嘅事去做。咁好多市民都會問我哋，究竟呢一個俗稱網絡二十三條嘅版權修訂條例有幾急切咧？咁咁好，大家都知道咧，喺現時嘅版權條例入邊咧，亦都有好多咧係保障一啲侵權行為嘅做法。

583
01:54:43,380 --> 01:55:00,020
但係倒翻轉頭咧，今次嘅修訂，由於係冇聽取到咧，係包括係好多誒市民同埋議員嘅意見咧，所以喺成個修訂入邊咧係有好多缺失嘅。而事實上喺三個包括嗰三個修訂。

584
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:20,310
誒公平使用，包括係嗰個誒contract override等等嘅一啲嘅誒提出嘅修訂咧。如果政府能夠係細心去聆聽，同埋係有機會咧一齊去討論嘅話咧，其實係唔需要咧係再交畀一個專責委員會。但係如果睇咗局長琴日嘅發，聽咗局長琴日嘅，

585
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:21,770
嘅發言咧，主席。

586
01:55:22,050 --> 01:55:25,710
我係完全聽唔到政府有任何嘅。

587
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:27,280
啊！覺醒嘅。

588
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:47,770
佢似乎係喺唔喺香港居住，或者甚至唔喺呢個地球嘅。佢一路講緊啲嘢咧，都係同第一、二次佢嘅發言咧係冇乜太大嘅分別。除咗攻擊，除咗係不斷咧係為政府咧係辯護之外咧，係完全咧係冇咧係觸及個問題嘅重心。

589
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:50,860
因為而家我哋最擔心咧，就喺呢一個情況之下。

590
01:55:51,140 --> 01:56:03,640
喺呢一個梁振梁振英政府嚇任下嘅呢一個政府底下咧，其實一路都令市民係完全唔放心嘅。再加上最近嘅銅鑼灣書屋嘅事件。

591
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:11,710
郭家麒議員，主席，我而家講緊。我知道，我再要提醒議員咧，而家依一個係好狹窄嘅。

592
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,910
係。

593
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:15,400
呢個議事知道主席。

594
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:24,050
王國興講咁耐，離曬題，你都唔出聲。我係有出聲，我係一路邊一個議員離題，我會出聲提醒佢嘅。

595
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:25,980
我而家講緊啊，主席。

596
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:32,540
咁咧就係大家喺呢一個情況底下咧，對於政府嘅信任咧係相當之低。

597
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:52,830
因為呢一個版權修訂條例咧係一把刀嚟嘅，的的確確，如果再加埋其他同呢個電腦相關嘅法例，包括我哋而家講嘅誒不誠實使用電腦罪啊等等，加埋落嚟咧，其實就正正係一把大刀，係隨時會斬落去香港任何一個人身上。

598
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:57,010
所以喺呢個情況底下咧，係冇可能咧。

599
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:59,510
係容許到政府夾硬嚟。

600
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,160
噉樣嘅做法。

601
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:12,770
除咗令到個社會嘅撕裂更加大，除咗令到市民對政府嘅不但止唔信心，係個怨恨更加大之外咧，係於事無補嘅。

602
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,770
另外一方面咧，代主席。

603
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:35,060
噉啊，雖然啊，林鄭司長咧就彈弓手啊，講咗唔認數，但係佢喺前上一、尋一日、尋日嘅報章入邊嚇，包括幾份啊親中嘅左報入邊都講得好清楚咧。佢覺得今次嘅討論呢個版權修訂條例咧，其實係有一

604
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:55,070
一個需要性去考慮咧，係將佢抽起嗱。當然，我唔去估計林鄭點解會講呢一翻説話咧，但係我相信佢做呢一個決定，或者企圖去做呢一個決定咧，係有佢嘅誒合理性，因為大家都睇到咧，呢一個條例咧，只係令到香港係更加分裂而家。

605
01:57:55,070 --> 01:58:07,230
唔係講緊網民嘅蔡主席，而係事實上咧，好多喺香港，你話係會用面書同埋一啲其他嘅誒，我哋叫做誒，你而家講緊易讀嘅問題，你。

606
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:10,450
於是，我繼續講啦。不過你中意停就停啦。

607
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:12,310
咁咧就。

608
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:25,090
好多嘅市民咧都係覺得係好有危險嘅，咁所以咧，今次如果我哋能夠係透過一個專責小組，係令到呢一啲嘅分歧咧係收窄。

609
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:45,760
係有呢個幫助噉，當然咧就我唔知啊林鄭就有冇同啊蘇錦良傾啦，噉啊亦都有冇同啲其他佢嗰啲誒，即係好似黃國興之流嗰啲人傾啦。因為事實上我哋聽到咧，其實工聯會誒會長啊黃國健咧都係認為咧係應該收收起嘅嚇。根據報道。

610
01:58:45,970 --> 01:59:05,980
噉就當然佢可以誒，公園會有啲澄清啦。咁但係咧就唔禁止佢嚇。事實上，陳鑑林議員咧根據報導咧，都認為咧係可以考慮。所以你見到咧就可能呢一條條例嘅影響係太過深遠，而事實上好多政黨同埋議員咧都可能咧喺呢個時候。

611
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:13,220
希望跳船同政府角力，噉啊，所以見得到咧呢一啲噉嘅情況咧不斷發生，但係點都好咧。

612
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,830
喺呢個時候咧。

613
01:59:15,110 --> 01:59:35,120
係回頭是岸咧，都係都係誒為時尚未晚嘅，因為喺呢一個機會，喺我哋討論喺五十五一A嘅時候咧，就正正咧係呢個時候，希望咧就係建制派嚇特別係曾經講過係希望收回呢條條例嘅一啲嘅議員咧，就喺投票。

614
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:50,090
個時候咧係表裏一致。誒，各位請，範範高委員。誒，主席規程問題整整三分鐘，我唔知你有冇察悉到，我哋有議員同事喺會議廳裏邊企喺度用講。我聽唔到你講嘢，範高委員，你再講個。

615
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:07,510
主席，我係想講誒規程問題，因為我頭先察悉到咧，最少有三分鐘，我哋有議員同事喺會議廳裏邊企喺度講手提電話。我想通知主席，不過當我緊起身嘅話咧，我嘅議程已經離開咗啦，係。

616
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:13,710
我而家見唔到，誒，國家議員請你繼續。好啊，多謝戴小晴。

617
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:29,820
噉啊，希望咧喺呢個時候咧嚇，即係都係有一個機會咧，令到佢哋咧係迴心轉意嚇，亦都係可以咧係有機會咧係可以繼續去做。主席好似會議廳唔夠議員，唔該點人數。

618
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,660
請議員翻回座位。

619
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:21,490
國家企業。

620
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:27,360
主席。

621
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:43,630
政府係有好多嘅機會咧，係撥亂反正，亦都有好多個機會咧。就正如阿林鄭啊，即係佢喺個訪問入邊去講咧，都係會應該考慮喺呢個時候咧，係要撤回。而事實上好多嘅。

622
02:15:43,910 --> 02:16:03,920
保皇黨同埋建制派嘅政黨同埋議員咧，都喺呢個情況下咧，都不斷咧係表示咧呢個草案其實唔係好大嘅重要，係值得咧係考慮係拎走。咁何秀蘭議員呢一個建議咧，事實上就係正正係一個嗯適合嘅機。

623
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:19,480
機會咧，令到呢一個法案咧係有機會咧喺得到市民嘅認同，同埋有一啲包括民主派三位議員提出嘅修訂咧，係獲得係接納咧，係能夠咧令到呢個。

624
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:23,760
版權修訂條例咧，係能夠完滿去通過。

625
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:27,470
事實上咧，喺今日嚟講咧。

626
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:37,080
就算冇呢一個俗稱網絡二十三條嘅版權修訂條例咧，香港唔係冇版權嘅保護嘅。香港大部分嘅

627
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:57,370
誒市民甚至網民咧，對於呢個版權嘅尊重咧，我相信喺世界上都唔會差過好多發展嘅已經發展嘅地區啊，甚至係政府口聲聲啊，即係話嘅美國誒，企圖利用呢個三零一條例咧，係令到香港咧係被。

628
02:16:57,370 --> 02:17:13,260
放入呢個監察條例等等嘅噉，所以咧喺呢一個情況底下咧，我哋係應該咧係喺誒去審議呢一個版權修訂條例咧，係利用呢一個相當好嘅空間咧，令到呢一啲嘅。

629
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:14,700
其見。

630
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:29,840
唔同嘅睇法，特別啦！而家喺呢一個情況底下，我哋覺得係最大嘅問題咧，就係一啲版權持有人同埋係誒包括網民嘅市民之間嘅分歧，因為喺誒。

631
02:17:30,170 --> 02:17:50,180
版權嘅持有人，即係我哋俗稱一啲叫大聯盟嘅多次嘅發言，同埋係誒接見誒去會見議員嘅時候都講咗咧。佢哋咧係不但止係好想去過，但係咧佢哋有一點咧就令我哋都有啲相當詫異嘅。佢就話：如果呢一啲修訂包括。

632
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:58,330
幾位議員嘅修訂係通過咧，佢哋寧願唔要。嗱，呢一種玉石俱焚嘅態度咧，似乎又另外有啲大惑不解。

633
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,370
噉啊！既然如果佢哋噉，

634
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:15,860
注重呢個版權呢一個重要性，同埋呢個條例嘅重要性。咁點解唔希望咧？係喺趁呢個機會令到呢個條例咧，係得到咧係圓滿嘅解決咧噉樣？

635
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,890
咁而正正咧。

636
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:38,180
利用呢一個專責小組咧，係一個相當之合適嘅做法。噉啊，當然呢個都係啊睇下啲議員啦，即係特別係建制派嘅議員會唔會係口是心非嚇，即係講一套做一套。因為如果佢哋唔係講一套做一套嘅話咧，我相信喺之後誒五啊五。

637
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:46,890
五一A嘅投票咧，佢哋應該咧係贊成咧，係呢一個誒做法，係由交由一個咧係專責小組去處理嘅。

638
02:18:47,190 --> 02:19:07,200
咁而家究竟我哋有啲咩嘢急咧？咁嗱，其實睇唔到嘅，因為呢一啲嘅唔同嘅保護咧，包括係對呢一個知識產權啊同埋版權嘅保護咧，喺現行嘅法例入邊咧，都係冇任何咧係做法喺具體上喺實際上或者。

639
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:11,180
執行上咧係有任何嘅機會咧，令到。

640
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:31,470
誒好多嘅，包括係擁有知識產權嘅地區誒公司或者組織咧，認為香港係一個極之咧危險嘅地方，一個極之咧不守或者不尊重版權條例嘅地方冇啊！我哋從來都冇呢一樣嘢發生，亦都好喺好多嘅情況底下咧，呢一啲嘅唔同。

641
02:19:31,470 --> 02:19:41,320
同嘅版權嘅誒條例入邊嘅具體嘅精神咧，包括係尊重嗰個原創人，尊重呢個二次創作。

642
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:51,010
等等咧，都係有做到嘅。反為而家呢個條例入邊咧，包括誒政府嘅所謂嘅豁免嗰六項豁免咧，其實係不足嘅。

643
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:58,680
正如好多議員都提出咧，呢個闊面咧，只不過係開咗一個大少少嘅一個嗯。

644
02:19:59,030 --> 02:20:09,440
一個圈都係一埲牆嚟嘅，即係你可以話嗰埲牆咧由極之窄就開闊咗少少，但係舉個例咧，連梁振英嚇本人。

645
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:29,730
佢呢個都啊喺佢嗰個宴會喺一個宴會入邊嚇唱歌喺面書嗰度係分發咧，都要夾硬嚟就認為佢咧係一個公眾嘅誒，喺譬如係屬於報道、評論時事等等呢一啲都係我覺覺得睇嚟係。

646
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:34,680
係一啲夾硬嚟嘅做法咧，係去做咧，先至係可以自圓其説嘅。

647
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:55,000
梁振英都如此啦，高官都如此啦。你估市民有冇咁大嘅能力咧？好似啊，即係梁振英等等嚇，可以係事後畀六百蚊咧，就可以解決咗問題咧？咁噉，當然咧，大家有好大嘅擔心嘅。正因如此咧，我哋睇唔到有任何嘅急切性。

648
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:15,010
具體上亦都睇唔到任何嘅危險，唔唔將呢一個條例咧係誒用一個比較合理、具體同埋一個誒誠懇嘅態度下，特別政府咧係誠懇嘅態度咧係去處理嘅。咁所以而家咧，我哋都係要面對一個重要嘅問題嚇噉。

649
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:19,850
既然我哋喺立法會嚇，都係有好多嘅唔同嘅。

650
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:35,920
啊，議案啊，或者一啲更加重要嘅法案啊，我都同意嘅，同意政府嘅睇法啊。包括啊，一啲議員都話啊，我哋仲有好多嘅更加重要嘅，或者更加急切性嘅一啲嘅議案去做，咁點解唔係利用呢個機會咧？咁？

651
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:44,640
主席，噉啊，最後有少少時間咧，我就想回應翻啊黃國興議員嘅批評。

652
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:50,660
噉我今日咧，主席我就喺網上就係瘋傳喺二零一四年九月九號咧。

653
02:21:51,120 --> 02:22:10,380
誒人民大學誒中國人民大學教授講過嘅，我哋嘅中國，我哋嘅國家係四方八無。咩叫四方八無咧？就係荒唐、荒誕、荒無、荒謬、八無咧，無知、無能、無情、無意、無道、無德、無恥同埋無賴。

654
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:22,620
頭先黃國興嘅表演嚇，即係文革式嘅表演咧，就令到我哋真係有啲擔心嘅，因為香港係一個都幾即係尊重一個。

655
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:43,120
公民社會嘅地方，用一啲咁古怪嘅做法，振地一呼啊，好似嗰啲遊擊隊嘅做法啊，用一啲噉樣即係冇乜用，經過大腦行出嚟就話，總之梁振英講嘅嘢咧就要支持，仲要叫高官唔好聽，繼續咧。

656
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,890
咧係間間眼嚟嗱，呢一啲咧其實。

657
02:22:47,170 --> 02:23:07,180
即係我唔知佢係咪靠害政府，亦或真係幫到？因為如果要幫一個政府要施政嘅話咧，就真係唔係用呢一啲咁低低級趣味嘅做法，亦都係令到我哋咧係議會劣質化嘅做法。我成日聽人哋講社會嘅劣質化，但係我諗黃國興議員呢一種嘅。

658
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:19,940
做法咧，的確令我哋咧係慘不忍睹嘅。即係我希望咧，佢哋都有一啲正常少少嘅人咧，係出嚟咧係講一啲正常啲嘅道理。本人緊支持，支持五十五日呢。多謝代主席。

659
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:22,680
多謝主席。

660
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:25,040
話黃國興議員就。
