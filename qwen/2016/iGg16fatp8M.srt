24

25
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,920

31
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:27,650
好啦，噉我哋逐一邀請誒各位團體代表發言。誒，首先我哋誒請嘅就係誒龐寶林先生。

32
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,750
主席你好。

33
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:50,060
誒第一，我哋專資會咧就支持二零一五年個強積金個公積誒金計劃個修訂個草案嘅。噉我哋咧就誒規定呢個受託人每個計劃提供一個受規管高度劃一嘅投資策略。噉我哋覺得呢個可以保障冇作出選擇計劃成員嘅累計。

34
00:05:50,060 --> 00:06:09,350
權益噉，我哋贊成咧，佢哋誒應該投資呢個預設嘅投資策略嘅。咁同埋咧，其他啲誒計劃成員亦都可以參加。噉我哋希望咧，佢哋嗰個誒誒體積越嚟大啊，同埋呢個開支咧，應該咧就誒嘅比率咧逐步下降嘅。

35
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:29,640
我哋咧，專資會咧就希覺得咧呢個運作希望咧就係要簡單易明，同埋咧透明度相當之高嘅。咁同埋咧就誒，我哋唔贊成咧呢個預設投資策略咧同埋指定成分基金咧係要交由咧受託人自己去設計嘅，因為即使嘅設計咧都會。

36
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:49,010
有呢個差別嚇，按規定設計嘅時候，咁所以咧，我哋覺得咧就誒相關基金咧又唔能夠比較，咁個費用亦都係高，咁所以我哋覺得咧就係誒就提供唔到咧呢個比較低嘅收費咧，就畀誒誒強積金嘅投資者。

37
00:06:49,560 --> 00:07:09,570
噉我哋專資會咧就建議政府同埋資金局咧，應該係劃一制定呢個預設投資成分基金嘅組合。咁同埋咧，邀請相關嘅專才咧，就去呢個係設置呢個方案。咁當然咧，誒睇佢年齡啊，同埋調整個投資組合啦。噉啊，建議咧就係資金。

38
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:23,390
局咧應該係定期檢討呢個預設嘅投資策略，同埋咧作呢個指定嘅成分基金咧作出呢個諮詢，噉啊確保咧呢個係符合年齡嘅需求，發揮咗保障嘅作用。

39
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:39,310
咁第另外咧，我哋覺得咧就避免咧提供太多嘅預設投資策略咧，咁指定成分嘅選擇咧，應該咧就係採用同一嘅資產配置，而市場適合咧最多應該三套嘅預設投資策略。

40
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,040
誒嘅計劃咧，供成員去選擇嘅。

41
00:07:43,800 --> 00:08:03,810
咁簡單嘅資產配置組合咧，我哋覺得有三類咧，大家都知道嘅啦，股票啊、債券啊、現金啊噉樣。咁如專資會咧就建議應該誒用相對低嘅被動式嘅投資，就用指數成分，例如咧就係誒盈富基金啦。大家知道盈富基金嗰個誒開。

42
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:10,400
支比率咧係相當之低嘅，噉我覺得咧呢個先可以達到咧長線咧為咧呢個誒。

43
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,300
強積金投資人咧，降低成本。

44
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:26,300
咁當然咧就誒有機會咧主動基金都有啲唔錯嘅，咁但係咧我哋覺得咧考慮合理回報穩定咧，就應該咧就係誒被動基金咧，我哋覺得更加適合。

45
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:46,640
咁專資會咧同意規定咧，預設投資嗰個策略支付嘅費用咧，應該喺零點七五或者以下。咁隨着強積金咧個發展路成熟咧，咁而且啲錢誒每年嘅每月供款啦，同埋每年供款同埋累積埋嗰個回投資回報咧，強積金嗰個供誒嗰個資金。

46
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,460
遲咧就越嚟大啦，噉我哋覺得咧就呢個誒呢個費用咧應該仲有下調嘅空間嘅。

47
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:15,160
政府同埋強積金咧，我哋覺得應該咧就留意強積金成分基金嘅收費同埋表現啦，儘量就完善呢個強積金嘅制度啦。誒，建議咧就係探討基金收費嘅機制，仲有冇調整嘅空間、調節嘅空間，同埋咧就研究基金嘅收費同埋表現嘅掛鈎呢個。

48
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,530
獎賞計劃有冇可行性？鼓勵基金經理咧持續提升基金嘅表現嘅。

49
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:33,700
咁最後咧，我哋建議咧就係政府繼續加強理財投資退休金保障嘅教育，咁協助咧就計劃成員咧因應個人嘅退休生活咧作出適當嘅投資決定。

50
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,050
噉我個誒重點講詞咧，已經講完啦。

51
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,630
好，多謝你。就下一位夏捷偉先生。

52
00:09:44,530 --> 00:10:04,540
Good morning, Chairman. I represent the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers. We represent 90% of the MPF operators in the market, and I'd like to share our view here. First of all, we are very supportive to the default investment scheme. To have more consistency amongst the different providers makes a lot of sense.

53
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:24,550
There's just one item which we believe is an issue: is the opt-in versus opt-out in the current proposal. Members will receive a notice, and if they do not actively send back a notice, then all their money will be transferred from existing default funds, which are very conservative.

54
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:44,560
Some of them are even guaranteed funds or money market funds. They would be moving their money to something which they may not be aware of. As we all know in Hong Kong, a lot of people are very busy. We receive a lot of mail. There's a high chance that a significant number of people will get that notice, will not read it.

55
00:10:44,560 --> 00:11:04,570
Will not fill it in, and at some point, if the money is transferred without them being aware of it, they are exposed to significant market risk. In our submission, we've given an example of Mr. Chan, who transfers his money from a very conservative fund into the DIS, could be exposed to 60% of equity.

56
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:24,580
Markets markets are very volatile as we have seen in the past couple of years, and they may be exposed to significant losses. So at the end of the year, they may get their MPF statement and suddenly realise that they have made a significant loss. So our point here is that we are supportive to more consistent DIs, but we need to make sure.

57
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,240
Sure that people make an informed decision. So let everyone.

58
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:47,490
Make an active choice to join into this new fund, so that they are fully aware of the potential risks involved, and that they will not be surprised years or months down the road with losses occurring from this change. We've seen.

59
00:11:47,790 --> 00:12:07,800
different financial scandals in the past couple of years. We just want to make sure that people who make that choice, moving their money from A to B, that they know exactly what is happening. So we are in favour of the DIS. We are very much against having people suddenly move all their money.

60
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,150
into this default fund. Last but not least, it will always also be challenging.

61
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:25,890
要figure out who exactly is a defaulter, because a lot of people joined the system 15 years ago. At that time, there was no requirement for the providers to actively track if people were.

62
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,130
Choosing.

63
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:47,420
That fund because they like it, or that they had no option and they just defaulted into it. So there will be a lot of administrative challenges to make sure that everybody is doing the right thing. So again, our point is supportive, but let's make people have them make a very informed decision about their own money. Thank you.

64
00:12:47,420 --> 00:13:07,430
誒下一位誒陳鄧元先生，誒主席你好，噉啊喺強積金改革問題上邊咧，工聯會一直建議積金局咧設立一個單一嘅核心基金嘅呢個做法咧，唔單可以產生成本嘅效應，降低強積金喺行政嘅費用，又可喺工友咧喺眾多選擇。

65
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:25,980
中咧易於尋求最穩健嘅基金投資，更可讓香港逐步發展完善嘅一個退休保障嘅制度。但係咧，財經事務同埋庫務局同埋積金局最終嘅建議咧，只係少收少保，實質咧仲未對有現存強積金面對嘅。

66
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:43,550
問題咧提出一個具針對性嘅建議，設立一個單一嘅核心基金，畀公共受託人營運，目的咧係降低行政同埋營運嘅成本，對工友咧更有利嘅。現時嘅強積金嘅市場咧，又畀幾個大嘅信託人所佔有。

67
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:52,950
所以現時嘅政府建議，對於一些細嘅信託人嘅而言咧，能否產生咗資金規模嘅效應咧，係令人懷疑嘅。

68
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,800
但係由於政府建議已到立法嘅階段，噉啊工聯會喺未放棄要求。

69
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:19,170
政府實行單一核心基金嘅前提下邊咧，盡量希望咧協助完善政府嘅建議，而有關嘅建議嘅內容咧就係有下邊三點嘅。第一喺現時嘅建議行政費咧就唔可以高於零點七五個percent嘅情況下，政府咧必須加有個條文咧必須保證咧零點七。

70
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:39,180
percent收費除行政費外咧，亦都包括基金公司所有嘅費用。換言之，基金所有嘅收費嘅總和咧，只可以收取零點七五嘅款項，唔可以再藉任何嘅名義咧收取其他嘅款項嘅。噉啊，第二咧，雖然政府曾建議財政司司長咧有權就呢個零點七五。

71
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:59,190
身行政費作出調整，但係事前建議咧就未有交代檢討行政費嘅時間表同埋準則。工聯會權益委員會咧建議政府就行政收費咧就一年一檢呢個做法咧可增加政府對基金公司嘅監管，基金咧就更具靈活性，亦可以避免基金。

72
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,220
公司喺兩年或者三年嘅安定期咧。

73
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,910
唔可以作呢個行政費下調空間嘅檢視嘅。

74
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,580
咁第三咧。

75
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:27,870
基金公司既然能夠設定咗有關嘅組合成為一個核心基金，咁咧對呢個核關有關呢個核心基金非常係有信心嘅。咁但係根據過往五年嘅恒生指數嘅升幅咧，每年都超平均都超過通脹。如果核心基金連續五年平均通脹都追唔到嘅咧？

76
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,370
根本就係由委個核心基金設立嘅願意同埋委託人嘅信任。

77
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:52,660
咁呢個表現咁差嘅公司有啲咩顏面去收取呢個行政費咧？噉我哋權益委員會建議有關嘅基金公司咧，應退回所有嘅費用，當中包括行政費畀工友。如果十年之內咧，基金錶現仍係唔能夠超過十年內嘅平均通脹咧，嗰個基金嘅所有委託金。

78
00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:01,230
應退翻畀所有嘅工友，而六至十年嘅行政費所有費用咧，亦都同樣一樣要畀翻所有嘅工友。

79
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,050
噉啊！最後咧，工聯會權益委員會建議政府咧，盡快取消強積金對沖。

80
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:28,450
對沖遣散費同埋長期服務金嘅機制，因為咧，無論核心基金設立以點樣完善，就算政府設立由政府任公共信託人嘅單一核心基金咧，如果唔取消對沖機制咧，就好似火燒後躝一樣，顧得前就唔顧得後，最終啊，只會益。

81
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:43,540
咗僱主咧，成為僱主解僱工友嘅備用錢，解決唔到近積金嘅設立，畀打工仔女退休生活嘅問題，完善退休保障嘅第二條支柱。多謝主席。好，下一位啊，陳浩廉先生。

82
00:16:43,950 --> 00:17:03,960
係唔該，主席。噉我首先要提嘅就係話，其實睇翻現有嘅強積金嘅表現咧，係十分之唔理想嘅。如果你睇翻佢嘅年報，在啊啱啱公佈一一四至一五年度嘅時候咧，佢嘅回報得係四啊四個percent。你比起任何嘅啊市場嘅指數嘅總回報咧，都係遠遠低過。

83
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:23,970
咁所以咧，我哋認為喺強積金個表現嗰度要著力去做好，噉就係包括去將嗰個嘅行政或者管理費降低啦，引入多啲嘅競爭，多啲嘅種類。噉我哋認為只有多競爭嘅時候咧，呢啲基金嘅公司咧先會咧喺誒行政費用或者喺佢個投資表現上面咧係會有進步嘅空間。

84
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:43,980
從而使到咧，我我哋所有嘅僱員咧係會受益。咁特別值得提有關強積金嘅討論咧，就係我哋自由黨係堅決反對取消呢一個誒強積金對沖嘅原因。好簡單，其實現在好多中小企咧已經係一個好睏難嘅經營環境上面，好多時佢哋賺出嘅利潤咧係好單薄。

85
00:17:43,980 --> 00:18:03,990
甚至乎只係緊緊咧係可以打和維持嘅啫。如果茂茂賢政府取消咧強積金對沖的話咧，就會使到我哋呢一個好多中小企咧轉型為虧。事實上有報告指出咧，現在喺雲雲三十幾萬中小企當中，如果引入強積金嘅對沖啊係取消之後咧，係會令到超過兩成中。

86
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:24,000
中小企轉型違規，換句話説，會係剝奪咗好多中小企應有嘅生存空間，亦都令到呢中小企嘅僱員咧失去嘅工作機會。長遠而言咧，係會打擊我哋香港嘅競爭能力，削弱咗我哋嘅生產力，最終受害嘅就係香港經濟同埋市民。所以我哋係堅決反對當局取消緊。

87
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:44,010
強積金誒嘅對沖嘅機制嘅啊，最尾想提嘅一點，主席就係話啊，其實當年誒推推出呢個強積金對沖啊強強積金嘅時候咧，商界已經表明咗對沖機制係一個必要嘅條件，亦都係商界嘅一個底線。咁但係喺強積金退出咗啊。

88
00:18:44,010 --> 00:19:04,020
十五年之後咧，政府冒冒然提出啊，有機會去改變呢一個遊戲規則去搬龍門，我哋認為對中小企一個好不公義、不公平嘅做法。原因就係有啲人會話十五年係好長嘅時間，但係主席希望你瞭解，其實對一個公司嘅企業壽命嚟講咧，往往係講緊幾十甚。

89
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:24,030
要付上一百年，要經營一個品牌都幾十年嘅時間，所以咧喺冒冒然啊嘅情況下，突然改變遊戲規則咧，係會令到好多啊有作中長遠投資嘅中小企嘅策略咧，係受到好大嘅打擊。而長遠而言咧，亦都會對一啲想作長遠投資嘅投資者嘅投資意欲咧。

90
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,330
係會有影響嘅。

91
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:42,420
啊，主席，基於我哋希望可以保護翻我哋香港嘅競爭力，希望咧可以係保護翻我哋經濟嘅長遠利益嘅話咧，我哋係堅決反對啊當局考慮去取消呢個強積金對沖嘅。唔該，主席。好，下一位，誒，柏志偉先生。

92
00:19:52,790 --> 00:20:06,870
yes yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I represent the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and we've been very supportive of the DIS core fund concept. We have very minimal comments on the bill.

93
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:19,000
And we would say that we've worked very cooperatively with both the HKTA, the administrators and the MPFA to try to create a solution that will benefit members over the long run.

94
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:33,440
We hope that you know once we launch this product, that as we continue to move forward, we will continue to look for ways to enhance and improve solutions for members, including the DIS and other products, and we will continue to work with the industry.

95
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,250
and the regulators to continue to try to improve the MPFA system on a variety of fronts.

96
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:59,740
我 guess the one comment we would have on the bills that we would ask for consideration that there be a fixed implementation date of January one, two thousand and seventeen, because of all the work that needs to be done to get ready, as well as some of the other initiatives that we have going on, such as mutual recognition of funds, that are also constraining the.

97
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,020
sources in the industry. Thank you.

98
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,290
好，下位詹偉基先生。

99
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:16,380
各位議員和成員，我代表香港社會學金融分析師，我們有6,000個投資專業成員在香港。

100
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:28,230
The society is supportive of this bill. This is consistent to our response to the consultation paper in September 2014 regarding the same subject.

101
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:48,540
Based on our position, we have four particular points to mention here. First, regarding the default investment strategies, we are supportive to this one. The out the out option from DIS mechanism in fact giving preserving the rights of members for adopting other investment strategies. In this point, we

102
00:21:48,540 --> 00:22:08,550
It means that in fact the there are more choices for the MPF members. Second point regarding the risk based on age investment principles, we notice that the MPF members mainly overexpose equity investments in Hong Kong, not mentioning the recent market collapse.

103
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:19,570
Apps, we know that you know there's a need for the low risk investment commensurate with the risk appetite, which is is a function of the age.

104
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,790
所以我們支持有啲啲風險，基於投資原則。

105
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:46,200
點，regarding the statutory fee control mechanism， we have some concern on the regular fee review with a bias view to just saying adjusting the level further downward， because we are fully aware that you know the optimal fee level is a function of multi factors.

106
00:22:46,200 --> 00:23:06,210
Including economic factors and also the fund size. In many other countries, we have a which has a smaller fund size. The the government or the authority provide some administrative support, which will lower the cost of running such NPF funds. In the

107
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:26,220
HK的HKSFA是認為，對費率上限的假設必須釐清和仔細闡述，以維持費率調整的彈性，不僅向下，也向上。調整機制調整管理費上限的機制必須詳細説明。

108
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,760
所以我們 urge the committee to look at the detail of such a fun of such a fee control mechanism.

109
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:49,680
last the last point is we also stress the importances of investor education to ensure the smooth flow out of the DIS constituents funds and also raise the standards of retirement fund management. Thank you very much.

110
00:23:49,960 --> 00:24:09,970
好，下位黃玉麟先生。誒，Thank you, Chairman. I'm representing the actual society of Hong Kong. The actual society of Hong Kong,誒，supports誒，the bill.誒，but we have two points to be make.誒，first，誒，we would like to make sure the members aware that the default investment strategy is not less.

111
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:29,980
Better than other investment options. Of course, you got a default, but you may got like a lower fee. But in the same times, like depending on different like economic cycle, this strategy could perform better or like worse than other funds, and may also on on risk adjust basis, it may not be.

112
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,080
like better than other options, so we like to make sure the members are fully aware when we launch this fund.

113
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:56,370
Secondly is when more people are opting out into this like default investment strategy. That's also increase the systematic risk of the system. In the sense that if just just on extreme cases when like all people in the same generation opt to the same.

114
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:16,380
Investment strategy and maybe upon the economic cycle, that generation of people could suffer the investment losses at the same time, and it could pay the burden like to to the government or other social system in particular years. So, but but but having said that, we we understand the weaknesses of this kind of default investment strategy.

115
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:26,670
The actual society still support the proposal. That's the end of my speech. Thank you, Chairman. 好，下位劉家時女士。

116
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,150
多謝主席。

117
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,240
我好今日，我好高興今日可以代表香港信託人工會出席今次委員會嘅會議。

118
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,010
向大家表達業界嘅意見。

119
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,340
我哋都認同預設投資策略。

120
00:25:44,010 --> 00:26:02,630
誒容許主席容許我用DIS，因為預設投資策略比較長啦，英文嗰個誒短嘅form係比較容易講。即係DIS，即係預設投資策略咧，係一個合當嘅強積金改革計劃，能夠幫助一啲冇時間或者唔識得揀嘅成員。

121
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,440
規範咁處理佢哋嘅強積金。

122
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:21,740
修訂條例統一所有計劃下嘅預設安排，目的係避免因投資策略、風險水平以至收費方面嘅差異而影響成員嘅退休資產。

123
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:31,690
喺強積金行業裏邊，受託人、行政管理人、保賬人同基金經理都擔當重要嘅角色。

124
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:41,200
而受託人行事，除咗依據法律規定外，更肩負上受信嘅責任，或者係誠信嘅責任。

125
00:26:41,850 --> 00:27:01,860
以成員嘅利益為依歸，就住D.I.S.自有嗰個諮詢文件開始，我哋就同監管機構一直保持對話，商討唔同嘅範疇，交換意見，例如基金嘅結構同埋自動降低投資風險機。

126
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,990
制嘅運作模式等等。

127
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:20,660
現時我哋亦好忙，為DIS所需要嘅營運流程以及計劃組成嘅文件同埋電腦嘅系統嘅更改作準備，投入更多更多嘅資源，配合今年內推行DIS。

128
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:37,170
EIS所引申嘅改動係唔少過早年推行嘅強積金半自由行，預計所有嘅預備功夫需要最快年底前先能夠完成。雖然而家仲係年頭，係其實時間上係非常緊迫嘅。

129
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,790
強積金嘅回報。

130
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,060
投資嘅市場嘅表現，同埋成員嘅選擇掛鈎嘅。

131
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,910
任何變動應該喺成員嘅知情同埋指示下進行。

132
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,290
根據草案上個過渡性安排。

133
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,770
現有賬户嘅有關成員將會收到一份由受託人發出嘅退出通知。

134
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:10,430
假如佢哋冇回應，就會自動將佢哋嘅強積金改為投資於DIS。

135
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:30,750
我哋想指出，強積金成員係有好多渠道可以知道佢個户佢嗰個賬户的投資嘅方向。佢哋可以透過週年嘅報表，每年最少有一次機會去審視自己嘅投資組合。佢哋願意繼續投資現在嘅投資安排預設安排，平。

136
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,900
不等於喺未得佢個同意之下，改為投資於DIS。

137
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:42,340
所會有成員唔同意呢個安排，加上過去半年九個月，全球嘅市場非常波動。

138
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,090
任何轉移會涉及潛在嘅風險。

139
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:53,140
好似而家有預設安排，有一定數量係屬保守或者較低風險嘅基金。

140
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:13,430
D.I.S.則投資於全球股票及債券。呢個改動可能會令一批現有嘅帳户成員出現短期嘅投資虧損，引致個別成員嘅不滿同埋投訴。雖然政府同我哋業界會加強成員嘅溝通。

141
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:20,390
同埋宣傳，但喺釋放波動嘅時候，呢個風險係不容忽視。

142
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,310
現時嘅低收費基金係指管理費等於。

143
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:34,180
等於或者低於年率一個percent，對我哋都已經係一個挑戰。草案上嘅零點七五收費上限嘅管控。

144
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,500
對所有業界嘅服務提供者。

145
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:55,580
嚟講咧，係一個新嘅目標，呢個新挑戰。不過，我哋聽到社社會嘅聲音，要求優化強積金計劃，尤其係收費方面，我哋一定會支持同埋配合政府同監管機構做好DIS嘅工作。

146
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:16,310
最後，其實大家最想見到嘅係咩咧？係大眾對強積金投資嘅意識有所提升，每一位強積金成員更加關心自己嘅強積金户口，發揮強積金作為退休保障框架中第二根柱、第二支柱嘅角色。

147
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,120
多謝各位。好，下一位魏德勤先生。

148
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:42,180
Thank you, Chairman. I represent the Employers Federation of Hong Kong, which has long been an advocate of the M.P.F. system, which obviously is designed to enhance the retirement protection for for employees, and we are therefore very supportive of anything which is designed to improve such system.

149
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:53,750
We understand that a substantial amount of funds, perhaps up to up to 20% of the MPF system, is currently in products which are being used as default funds.

150
00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:04,390
although it is also recognised that it may not be able to identify precisely how many of those those those funds are there because of a non-choice.

151
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:25,380
We agree that a mandated requirement, which more appropriately reflects the wisdom of reviewing and considering investment strategies as an individual approaches retirement, makes perfect sense. And for this reason, we, the Employers Federation, we we support the introduction of the the DIS.

152
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,560
We also agree that the product should be standardised to a large extent.

153
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:45,280
We encourage the authority and the administration to engage closely with the industry to ensure a smooth introduction of the DIs mechanism when it does eventually come into force. Thank you very much. Well, I wait.

154
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,480
鄭達雄先生。

155
00:31:47,900 --> 00:32:07,910
多謝主席。誒，公民黨東區區議員鄭達雄。咁誒，我諗今日咧就大部分嘅出席者咧，我睇個名單咧，其實我相信對於預設投資策略呢樣嘢咧，即係大家都贊同嘅。咁但係大家要諗下，究竟淨係整咗預設投資策略，對於成個強積金嘅改？

156
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:27,920
格夠唔夠咧？咁多年嚟咧，強積金制度千瘡百孔，好多基金嘅收費高昂，平均開支咧係高達一點六個percent。而喺上年啦，強積金係整體錄得二點九五percent嘅。根據呢個理柏公佈嘅數據，差唔多每人平均帳面係蝕咗六千蚊，唔單。

157
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,780
單止跑輸通脹啦，保本都做唔到。

158
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:43,820
打工仔捱到退休嘅時候，強積金户口被高收費、低迴報、殘食得七七八八嘅時候咧，仲要畀僱主對沖一筆所謂嘅長期服務金，咁究竟？

159
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:59,730
誒呢個呢個處理係合唔合理咧？噉啊喺成個制度咧，佢哋係根本得唔到應有嘅保障，亦都發揮唔到強積金令到誒打工仔可以安老嘅願意。咁所以咧，公民黨認為呢個咧先係制度嘅根本所在。

160
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:20,130
誒強積金管理費過高啦，係一個事實嚟嘅。我相信大家都會明白。咁今次咧做一個預設投資策略咧，只係少收少保，令到管理上限係定於每年管理費嘅零點七五percent。佢其實咧，歧視咗每一個受託人啦，都有條件有空。

161
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:40,140
間啦，將基金嘅收費降低，而強積金咧，嘅積金局咧多次強調呢個係十五年嚟第一次引入收費上限。咁但係其實值得炫耀咩？過咗十五年先係即係作為一個噉嘅改革，都係零點七五percent，亦都無法係幫到好多嘅市民做到去。

162
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,280
一個真正嘅退休安排，噉樣值得炫耀咩？

163
00:33:43,590 --> 00:34:03,600
今次推出嘅預設投資安排，主要針對咧好多冇投資選擇嘅打工仔。好似頭先位先生講啦，其實佢對於一啲市民一班打工仔一班辛勤工作嘅人嚟講咧，其實對於佢哋咧係一個做好一個投資嘅教育咧，先係最緊要，因為我哋見到。

164
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,330
有四分一人咧，仍然都係未作出呢個投資選擇。

165
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:27,840
誒，我哋如果唔做好呢個投資嘅教育咧，對於佢哋咧係一個負擔多於保障。我哋應該反思下，究竟除咗今日講緊嘅零點七五percent cap頂之外咧，係咪應該畀更多嘅財務管理協助，甚至推行一啲無需自行管理嘅退休保障計劃畀佢哋。

166
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:34,830
自由咁參與，令到佢哋為香港繁榮默默付出嘅市民咧，可以安享晚年咧。

167
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:55,230
今日推出咗零點七五嘅收費上限，令人擔心咧。收費上限會否變成或一嘅收費就係零點七五percent？咁喺同一嘅收費下邊咧，其實好難咧做到一個競爭，係令到各個受託人公司咧係即係降低佢哋個嗰個誒投資嘅管理費。

168
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:10,440
係啦，去爭取更加多人嘅支持，咁亦都不善於一班適於適宜比較嘅大公仔去吸引，即係令到佢哋選擇嗰個計劃。咁所以咧，呢個計劃會否變成受託人？即係

169
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,200
誒不能即係更加自我檢討。

170
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:22,600
又保證到呢個有零點七percent收入大公仔惡夢咧，當局咧必須密切監察同埋定期檢討嘅。

171
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:42,890
噉啊，言猶在耳。其實大家都應該記得，梁振英政府咧係承諾過做一個強積金對沖嘅安排。咁但係去到今日，我哋淨係傾緊零點七五percent，而並非係講緊對沖強積金啦。公民黨對此表示十分失望。公民黨咧促請積金局盡快。

172
00:35:42,890 --> 00:36:02,900
研究將其他強積金投資計劃嘅收費咧進一步下調，唔好等大公仔嘅血汗錢啦被無理慘無理慘食。多謝主席。好，下一位誒，馮裕其先生。主席你好，我係代表香港退休計劃協會嘅。噉我哋協會咧係贊成成立嘅預。

173
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:22,910
設投資策略嘅噉，其實整體嚟講，我哋誒有少一個意見咧，想同大家分享，就係關於第時點樣用呢個選擇參加同埋選擇不參加，即係opt in同opt out方面嘅將來嘅處理手法嘅。因為其實誒M P F成立以嚟咧咁多年嚟啊，積金局咧都一路都都鼓勵翻本。

174
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:42,920
本身每一位member、每一位僱員咧，係點樣去主動噉樣瞭解翻自己本身嘅投資策略同埋需要嘅。但係，與此同時嚟緊將來嘅叫參選選擇參加或者選擇不參加嘅時候咧，其實都會中間衍生咗一部分嘅風險咧。其中咧，其實可能會令到會有多好多嘅投。

175
00:36:42,920 --> 00:37:02,930
投資上嘅complain或者叫投訴喺啲方面顯生嘅，咁啲方面其實係我哋我哋應該嚟緊要留意翻嘅。其實我哋協會咧，其實亦都希望咧，積金國力值呢個機會咧，對香港二百七十萬嘅僱員咧，叫做其實講翻本身積金嘅處本身嗰個處理方法，其實而家一路以嚟咧，好多人都。

176
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:22,940
夠病其實可能積金唔夠呢個退休嘅需要，其實喺五大支柱裏面，其實M P F已經只不過係佔其中一個環節。另外，與此同時，亦都講翻頭先我講到嘅不參加與不參不參加或者opt in或者opt out中間本身衍生出嚟嘅風險，其實呢方面佢哋都瞭解翻，亦都要注重翻。

177
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:42,950
多啲嘅投資策略噉，希望我啲嘅分享係睇唔咁多，唔該。好，誒，最後一位係阿羅文輝先生，係多謝主席。噉我哋廣九勞工社團聯會咧，對於今次誒預設投資策略其實係表示歡迎嘅，因為我哋上年都做過一個調查，其實發現都好多打工仔咧，對於強積金嘅認識。

178
00:37:42,950 --> 00:38:02,960
誒，甚至乎呢個文件各方面嘅一啲嘅認知，其實都係非常之低嘅。咁即係預設投資策略本身就係幫一啲打工仔，如果佢一開頭冇任何選擇嘅時候，就可以畀佢提供翻一個即係誒好少少嘅一個選擇，同埋將嗰個行政費係控制翻一個比較低嘅水平。我哋。

179
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:22,970
覺得呢一個係一個即係誒相對起個比較理想呢個做法嘅，即係希望可以保障翻啲完全唔理回強積金嘅一啲嘅打工仔嘅。咁其實除咗呢一個意見之外，我哋勞聯都覺得誒預設投資策略其實只不過係誒強積金其中一個比較細小嘅一個環節。

180
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:35,790
嘅噉，其實誒除咗呢一個之外，我哋以前都提出過一啲，例如研究一個公共受託人嘅一個可行性嘅，因為嘢受託人多誒，已經係眾所周知嘅事實。咁誒。

181
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:44,840
同埋亦都冇一個係由一啲非牟利團體去做嘅一個管理嘅受託人嘅，咁如果誒，其實未來。

182
00:38:45,120 --> 00:39:05,130
我哋勞聯都覺得誒，強積金可唔可以將誒呢一個方案咧擺入去一個誒研究入邊，或者去再探討下嗰個可行性咧？咁誒去到最後啦，咁其實即係講嚟講去，強積金最大嗰個問題就唔係在於係咪有預設投資策略呢啲咁細小嘅問題嘅，最根本我哋勞。

183
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:25,140
勞聯覺得嘅問題就係誒退對沖嘅呢個問題。咁其實對沖即係受影響嘅人數就同埋個金額，亦都非常之大。早前好多新聞都講過嘅。咁所以我哋勞聯都誒都最後希望政府或者強積金誒積金局呢邊都誒研究到底對沖呢個問題，嗰位可幾時可以？

184
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:32,050
解決唔係淨係話喺誒特首嘅政綱寫落去就噉樣就算數嘅，噉啊多謝主席。

185
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:47,450
就各位團體嘅代表咧，都先後表達咗佢哋嘅意見，咁有啲意見咧都係好誒，好好好嘅。噉我想先睇一睇政府方面想唔想就住團體剛才發表嘅意見，作一個初步嘅回應。

186
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,690
好，阿鍾女士。

187
00:39:50,040 --> 00:40:02,230
好多謝主席。誒咁都好多謝誒各位唔同團體嘅意見啦。噉我哋都好開心聽到誒，其實出席嘅團體都係支持我哋呢個預設投資策略嘅，即係呢個施行嘅。

188
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:22,520
咁誒有幾樣嘢我想講翻咧誒，或者跟住我可以請我哋啊積金局嘅同事再補充嚇誒。我聽到好多係業界嘅代表咧就住嗰個誒所謂嘅誒opt out，即係嗰個過渡安排opt out呢一個安排咧，佢哋係有一啲意見嘅。

189
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:42,690
咁誒，我想講咧，就係話我哋呢個預設投資策略咧，成個政策嘅目標咧，係希望保障嗰一啲唔懂得或者根本係好啊唔理佢嗰個誒強積金户口嘅即係嘅嘅計劃成員嘅。所以喺誒呢個情況底下，如果我

190
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:59,850
我哋要佢哋做一個所謂嘅out-in嘅啊安排嘅話咧，其實可能根本就達唔到嗰個啊，我哋要保護佢哋誒呢一個目標嘅。咁其實我哋今次咧就係話誒，我哋其實係嗯。

191
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:20,140
透過呢一個噉嘅outdoor approach咧，其實畀咗一個啊法律嘅基礎咧，就係話畀啊各位誒受託人咧係可以喺呢個基礎底下咧去啊一個法律嘅責任咧係將一啲冇選擇個。

192
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:40,150
佢哋任何嘅投資嘅指引嘅誒計劃成員咧，係將佢啲錢咧搬去嗰個預設投資策略底下嘅。我哋認為噉樣咧，先至能夠最能夠係達到嗰個係個政策目標，係保護呢啲咧。我哋所謂係即唔理佢嗰個強積金户口嘅一啲誒，即係計劃成員嘅。

193
00:41:40,150 --> 00:42:00,160
咁另外都聽到咧，業界都有誒好多嘅代表咧，佢哋講咗關於嗰個啊，會唔會係喺一個噉樣嘅opt out嘅安排底下咧？其實係令到啊誒嗰個成員根本唔知發生咩事咧。咁呢個咧，我哋誒積金局。

194
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:20,170
係會咧，係誒會有做一啲大型嘅宣傳係啦。希望咧就係話令到佢哋誒可以係知道其實成件事係一個乜嘢嘅安排啦。佢哋甚至係可以喺未做嗰個誒誒預設投資策略呢一個噉樣嘅過度安排之前咧，其實可能係已經啊，我哋。

195
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:31,850
所謂誒逐漸瞓醒咗，可能係再睇下自己個誒户口裏邊嘅誒投資安排，然後係主動咧係做一啲咧即係誒佢哋嘅投資指示嘅。

196
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:52,650
咁另外亦都聽到咧，就係話對於嗰個係誒實施日期，大家都係有一啲即係誒好緊張，希望可以即係有足夠嘅時間去做。正正係咁咧，我哋其實就係都想喺呢度喺誒呢個法委員會裏邊努力啲工作咧，非想快啲係即係嗰個誒法例係可以得。

197
00:42:52,650 --> 00:43:12,660
到即係大家嘅支持咧，就實施呢個噉樣嘅投資策略，希望可以盡快咧。誒，我哋嘅受託人啊，等等所謂嘅即係我哋嘅服務提供者咧，可以係誒快啲開始佢哋嘅工作，包括向基金局咧係即係作出個申請啊，係誒嗰個投資策略係點樣樣去。

198
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:24,340
去即係啊設計啊等等嘅嚇誒噉我諗我就住呢個呢兩個。我睇下積金局方面有冇邊位想有咩補充？馬誠信先生。

199
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:44,820
Thank you, Chairman. I'll just respond very quickly on an issue that was raised by several submissions about the need for continuing focus on educating members so that they are capable of making investment decisions. We of course support that, and the authority and the industry and other stakeholders continue to invest resources in doing that.

200
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:57,330
however, we need to recognise that the whole focus of this proposal is designed for a different set of members. It's all very well to have information out there and to be able to provide skills to people to make decisions.

201
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,560
但我們知道，both localy and internationally，有個大group of members who couldn't care。

202
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:23,190
會never be upskilled or just don't find the time to do it. So there'll be lots of reasons, even if you've got it out there, that people won't make decisions. And that's what this proposal is about: better protecting the interests of that group. So those two things need to work together because there are two different, at least two different sectors in society in that respect. And so we recognise that though, and we and

203
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:35,120
We, the industry and other stakeholders, do need to continue to invest resources to better educate members, so those who do want to make decisions and are capable of doing so, do best look after their own interests.

204
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:55,410
albeit with a better framework for protecting those who do not. Thank you, Chan。好噉就誒議員嘅發問嘅時間啦。咁暫時咧就有兩位係舉手啊，想誒問問題嘅。噉啊，大家可以啊問團體嘅代表或者問政府方面。噉就有鄧家彪議。

205
00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,790
議員同埋陳建波議員嚇，噉就每位都係誒五分鐘啊！就

206
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,420
好，阿鄧家彪言。

207
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:24,710
多謝主席。首先，多謝咁多專業界別、咁多團體咧嚟到誒聽證會，係提出你哋嘅意見。咁亦都正如一次政府咁講咧，基本上對於預設投資策略咧，就核心基金咧，基本上所有團體都係同意嘅。咁當然喺技術上，其實未必。

208
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:44,720
嘅技術啦，可能喺利益考慮上，對於所謂惡勾惡in咧，就有誒好明顯係受託人咧，係好有自己嘅睇法。咁但係咧，我諗作為勞工團體或者熟悉即係一般市民嘅諗法嘅議員咧，係唔會同意咧，係即係誒惡in嘅，一定係即係。

209
00:45:44,720 --> 00:46:04,730
先由即係呢一個嘅預設投資策略咧，係問咗。如果你冇反對，就直接即係轉移去啊預設投資策略或者核心基金咧，呢個係較為恰當嘅做法。一個邏輯好簡單嘅，本身你都唔做投資選擇咯，點會面對呢啲表格會願意或者係懂？

210
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:24,740
得或者係想研究啊，究竟係發生啲咩事咧？咁所以對於啊呢一個嘅安排，我哋絕對同意嘅。尤其我覺得比較咧，令我覺得啊，即係一致咧啊。成日政府話而家勞資要有共識咧，唔容易，但係我睇到有共識啦，因為今日冇出席嘅兩個好重要嘅商界團體咧。

211
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:41,260
佢都有個意見書嘅，噉就係中華總商會同埋中華廠商聯合會，佢哋都係好清晰講，第一，如果由十幾個、十五個活躍嘅受託人自己再自己組合一個D.I.S咧。

212
00:46:41,540 --> 00:47:00,180
啊，成效係係令人質疑嘅，因為一個就係個個規模效應，一個咧根本咧都係比較唔到，噉啊都係咧同意咧單一嘅DIS或者少數，並且最好研究咧由公共手攤去做。哇，勞資好有共識喎！

213
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:20,530
點解政府同基金局唔採納咧？噉就算我見到咧，係第一個發現啊啊！專業及資深行政人員協會阿坡所講啊，都可以一次用盈富基金嘅做法啊，將嗰個投資嘅責任或者投資嘅角色係用一個高度經。

214
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:40,540
競爭嘅方式咧，喺市場上邊揾兩三個，好似而家盈富基金噉樣嘅處理。噉我哋又覺得唔錯嘅，因為教育界用緊公積金就係呢個模式。咁所以真係令我哋質疑咧。最後咧，雖然你成功咧，或者好堅決啊，用惡鬥，但係咧，似乎又將而家嗰。

215
00:47:40,540 --> 00:48:00,550
嗰個核心基金交翻畀十幾個受託人自己搞咧，又畀我哋覺得並唔係喺打工仔或者成員嘅最佳利益嘅立場裏面去做呢個標咯。咁所以即係呢個就係我我基本嘅概括嘅睇法。噉啊，希望咧一陣間有所回應。第二就係對於我哋工聯會特別提。

216
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:11,400
出一個就係管理費點樣可以夾到實啊！即係唔好用其他名義去即係誒令到嗰零點七五呢個percent嗰個上限咧，係突破咗個上限。

217
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,400
咁第二嘅咧就係究竟佢個表現，如果係根本合理嘅預期，唔好跑輸通脹啊！

218
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:38,690
咁喺呢一度有冇懲罰嘅機制，加強嗰個嘅即係誒監管，令到誒作出投資決定嘅嘅受託人，或者係佢哋下面嘅一啲嘅投資機構，真係會睇實我哋嗰個核心基金咧，而唔係誒，既然嗰啲都唔理自己強積金嘅，我求其啦個表現，有冇一啲？

219
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,090
噉嘅措施可以加強嗰個表現啊？點解？

220
00:48:42,370 --> 00:49:02,380
好，邊位想答啊？鐘女士，多謝主席。誒，我先講翻就係誒，其實而家喺嗰個法例裏邊咧，唔係話將成個預設投資策略咧，全部畀曬受託人去設計嘅。其實我哋喺個誒法例裏邊咧，都講得好清楚，係需要有一啲原。

221
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:22,390
質嘅，包括係話嗰個需要有一個全球分散投資啦。另外咧，就係話嗰個係佢係啊，我哋呢個策略裏邊咧，其實係有兩個成分基金嘅。呢個都規定咗，而兩個成分基金裏邊所有嘅誒高風險投資或者低風險投資嘅一啲嘅誒。

222
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:42,400
裏邊嘅成分咧，嗰個誒百分比咧，我哋亦都係有規定嘅。咁另外仲有一樣嘢就係話，去到佢哋要個降低，係因為個年紀而降低嗰個風險嘅呢個機制咧，亦都擺咗喺嗰個法例裏邊。咁喺將來如果法例係得到實施嘅話咧，受託人係需。

223
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:57,310
要根據呢啲噉嘅原則咧，去啊設計佢嘅即係嗰個噉樣嘅誒預設投資策略嘅。咁誒呢個係喺個法例底下嘅，或者我請啊誒馬成俊先生都講一講即係個誒仔細。

224
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,890
好，馬成信先生。

225
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:17,560
Thank you, Chairman. If I can respond to a couple of Mr. Tang's points. Firstly, in relation to the opt-in/opt-out, there have been several comments in relation to that. If I just explain the background and how this works a little bit, so there's no misunderstanding. For the majority of accounts.

226
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:37,900
Opt-in will apply. All members will, before commencement and after commencement, get a notice about this new thing. And if they so wish, they can tick the box to choose to invest in the default investment strategy. The rule is slightly different for a smaller group of accounts, and that is accounts that exist before the start.

227
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,800
係新法。

228
00:50:40,080 --> 00:51:00,090
That are wholly, wholly invested in the current default, and where the trustee has no basis to believe that the member has hasn't made a choice. So that is a relatively constrained group. When members get when we get to clause by clause, we'll take members through that specific section just to see how limited it is. For that group, the rule proposed is that they'll get an

229
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:20,100
noticed，所以，efforts will be made to notify that person。但係， consequence is if they don't do anything，因為，they are defaulters， they will be moved to the default investment strategy。We think that's consistent with the outcomes of the consultation。We also think it's consistent with the nature of this change， that it deals with people who don't make choices。And as far as

230
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:34,540
We can tell it's also consistent with the transitional arrangements that have been made in the only other system we can see that has imposed this type of default investment strategy after the event. So we think it's consistent with the objective, the history and the and the reason for doing that.

231
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,740
嗯。

232
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,620
啊！

233
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,690
下位啦，就阿陳建波員。

234
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:57,840
係多謝主席。第二輪啊，首先係多謝各位今日出席呢個誒聽證會，變咗我哋可以瞭解多啲啦。噉我諗聽完之後咧，似乎有一個重點就係話嗰個誒最重要就係嗰保險業界同埋呢個投誒信託人工會，佢哋都一致咧覺得話係。

235
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:18,130
誒關於opt-in定opt-out咧，咁即係究竟係畀個客選擇參加定係誒不選擇參加？呢個係好係好重要嘅。我覺得而家係差唔多係最重要咧，係佢哋對呢樣最最有意見啦。其實兩種方法都有好處嘅。嗱，當然我明白政府點解會會會會咁做啦。你而家做opt-out，即係話咧，如果佢唔選擇參加，

236
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:38,140
家你就驚咧，好多人根本就都唔會理嗰啲嘢。噉佢咧就變咗，好多人咧都都係咧係誒，佢能夠自動參加啦。即係政府嘅意思係咁啦。咁但係嗰啲誒服務提供者擔心咧，就係話咧，如果係噉樣做咧，其實一變相咧就將佢自動參加咗。自動參加咗結果之後咧，第日佢發覺輸咗錢咧。

237
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:58,150
就會找嗰啲嚇服務提供者晦氣㗎嘛？即係佢話當時我幾時又同意你啊？當然你亦都係用個法例去保障咗個服務投資，但係去投訴去嘈嗰時，唔係去嘈政府啊嘛，係嘈嗰啲服務提供者啊嘛。佢哋係根據佢哋而家個經驗咧，而家啲人咧又好中意爭取自己嘅權益㗎嘛。噉你真係事實上又真係未必好清。

238
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:18,160
清楚嘅喎，咁所以你究竟究竟應該係用opt in啦，定opt out，即係咁畀佢書面選擇參加，定係話你要書面選擇退出咧？即係呢個邊個方法好咧？我諗你值得係繼續同我哋傾咯。即係我明白兩兩兩方面嘅嘅好處或者唔好處，但係事實上呢個未白未解決啊嘛，係嘛？咁所以我希望。

239
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:33,250
你真係要誒花多啲時間繼續同所有啲服務提供者咧係詳細討論。你現在有啲所謂有啲修改咗話咧，係如果以前係有一啲指示嘅，又可能豁免啊咁嗰啲噉嘅嘢咧，其實係冇解決到問題咯。即係你唔好以為係噉係解決咗問題。

240
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:53,960
事實上，如果你有咁有信心，你係能夠係有大量嘅教育活動，可以令到市民係明白究竟成個計劃做乜嘅話咧，你都唔使擔心啦。如果你覺得你係咁透徹嘅，你真係咁多宣傳嘅，每一個人都明白緊自己做緊乜嘢咧，佢就會咪咪等佢選擇參加咯，係嘛？咁所以咧，呢啲係講唔通嘅呢啲。

241
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:13,970
自相矛盾㗎，一方面你又話啲市民根本都唔會好清楚啦，一方面你又話有大量嘅誒宣傳教育令佢清楚。如果佢真係清楚，你咪等佢做一個自願性好清楚之下而有決定咯。因為真係你唔能夠排除有個風險嘅，真係會損失好多錢㗎嘛。佢有一個特別係有啲保證嘅基金，有啲保證嘅基金突然間你將佢轉。

242
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:33,980
咗去一啲咧，係真係有誒好大損失。噉你難辭其咎啊！我而家唔係要求你即刻答我，即係希望你咧係繼續呢個唔好中斷你哋嗰個溝通啊，大家互相理解去做一個咧係令香港市民特別係嗰啲係最唔懂得投資嘅市民咧，係一個最好嘅保障。噉我希望你繼續做呢樣啊。

243
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,100
好。

244
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:55,390
誒，一個意見嚟嘅。下一位咧就係潘少平議員。多謝主席，噉啊，亦都多謝今日嘅團體嚟畀意見。當然，即係正話都有同事講，今日大部分嘅團體咧都係即係贊成呢個誒預設基金呢個法例嘅設立。咁其實咧就誒，正話有聽到團體講咧，就係關。

245
00:54:55,390 --> 00:55:15,400
關於對嗰個誒收費嗰個意見啦，噉就誒大家即係其中有啲工會團體，即係好希望咧，就係嗰個收費咧，即係而家零點七五。當然咧，就係係一個單一收費嘅，唔有其他啲即係額外嘅，即係其他嘅收費。咁亦都希望係一年。

246
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:35,410
有一檢嘅噉就因為事實上即係嗰個費用咧，我唔知道而家我哋而家嘅條例裡面咧，即係當然而家就希望透過呢個預設基金咧，就將嗰個市場嘅力量咧，令到個收費可以進一步降低啦。噉我我唔知道誒對嗰個一年一檢，如果喺我哋條文裡面係唔係？

247
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:55,420
可以即係加落去咧，呢個第一個嘅嘅希望，依家可以解釋一下各方嗰方面。第二個咧，正話都講過咧，就係可能誒，我我嘅理解咧就係誒，你唔選擇就會落咗呢個預設基金啦。咁事實上以往就啲顧員就唔會誒有部分真係唔識選擇，噉。

248
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:15,430
就誒舊嘅嘅賬户理論上就係你一路佢都要再問佢一次嘅，咁如果佢肯制嘅，佢都會擺落去。咁另外一方面，我聽講咧，亦都有啲誒户口根本係冇人認嘅，就即係等於而家銀行都有啲户口咧係有錢冇人認。咁呢個情況，我唔知道誒，資金局裏面有冇呢啲資料可以提供啊？究竟？

249
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:35,440
有幾多呢啲户口甚至冇咧？就將來會唔會喺而家二能嘅條例裏面去處理埋呢啲冇人認嘅户口嘅安排咧？咁講。好，阿鍾女士係咪你回應啊？好啊。不過你回應嘅時候最好盡量靠近呢個麥嚇，因為個聲音唔係好夠。好。同埋我都想你誒澄清一點，而家咧即係話個管理費係零。

250
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,690
零點七五。

251
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:57,260
呢個咧仲有一啲費用係未包在內嘅，譬如有啲咩會計啊、律法律服務啲費，大約嗰度應該有零點二到，咁所以加埋咧就唔好誤會零點七五唔係包底嘅，嚇應該係零，可能最後去到一都唔定嘅，噉你澄清一下。

252
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:17,270
啊啊！好啊，阿鐘女士，好唔該，主席嚇。誒嗱，其實喺我哋而家個法例底下咧，基本上就誒將嗰個誒收費咧，係喺誒我哋第三十四D C條嗰度咧，就係係嗰個誒收費嘅一個管制嚟嘅。咁即係裏邊包含嘅嘢。

253
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:37,280
咧誒就包括係誒誒嗰個零點七五嗰個百分點啦。咁同埋就係話呢個零點七五裏邊其實係指一啲乜嘢嘅啊所謂嘅付費嘅服務咧。咁噉就包括係關於呢個核准受託人啦、指明服務提供者啦，或者係註冊計劃嘅規誒規限。

254
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:57,290
限誒管限規則裏邊指明嘅保賬人或者誒推薦商噉樣樣嘅，咁所以就係話誒，所以其實佢哋呢一個噉樣嘅收費限制咧，已經係喺一個法律嘅框架嗰度㗎啦。咁至於誒或者誒誒嗰個誒呢個咧，除咗呢啲範圍之外，我哋知道咧會。

255
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:17,300
有一啲實付嘅開支嘅，就正如頭先主席所講啦。誒，譬如話係一啲可能係需要畀啊會計師啊，誒或者係核數人員啊，或者係律師費啊、郵費啊，誒一啲或者係係一啲係可能係印刷嘅費用啊，甚至一啲畀政府係註冊嘅費。

256
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:37,310
費用啊，等等都會係一啲誒一啲實付嘅開支咧，係喺呢一個零點七五嘅百分點嘅除外嘅一啲開支嚟嘅嚇。咁呢個咧其實喺我哋較早之前咧係交翻畀立法會嘅一個誒文件咧，就住上一次嘅誒呢個草案委員。

257
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:53,650
會誒，大家問嘅問題咧，嗰度我哋都有講到嘅，嚇嚇。咁至於咧，就係話嗰個零點七五咧，係點樣樣去監管嘅咧？或者我請阿馬生誒，可唔可以即係誒都誒同大家交代一下？好，馬誠信先生。

258
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,970
嗯，Thank you, Chairman.嗯。

259
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,670
Can I go first to the question about the unknown members and the opt-in, opt-out?

260
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,560
誒。

261
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:23,980
不同 schemes 有不同 level of members  that they don't have contact details for. Our understanding is that that likelihood is greatest in the industry schemes where employers contend to just register members on a relatively informal basis. So in those schemes, there are more members whose contact

262
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,630
細節都唔知。

263
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:46,010
anecdotaly trustee tell us that figure could be up to a figure around ten percent in those particular industry schemes that that figure of course is much lower in the master trust schemes which are not the industry based schemes it's not that group though that is the issue in relation to the opt in opt out the issue is that for whatever reason

264
00:59:46,010 --> 01:00:06,020
There's a group of people who've not made decisions, and based on what we know about this, there are lots of reasons why they don't make decisions. They couldn't be bothered, they're not engaged or whatever. So asking those people to make a decision is counterintuitive to what this is about. If we go to the effort of making a best fit solution for for people who do not make

265
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:26,030
decision，then we think it's consistent with the objective。但those people who haven't made decisions in the past go there，albeit they're entirely free，if they are informed and they are engaged and they do get the notice and want to do something，they're entirely free to make some other decision，either stay where they are or to pick some other funds。and that's the type of form that we're developing in conjunction with the industry to

266
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:46,040
make that work. In relation to the fee cap, I won't repeat what's been said in the submission or what Mr. Chong just said. In terms of how that'll be supervised, it will be an ongoing daily obligation. We will issue some guidelines to help the industry understand how that's to be calculated. It will be covered by the

267
01:00:46,040 --> 01:01:01,430
the scope of the normal audit requirements, and of course we will have all the normal enforcement powers, which are also set out in the paper that's been provided, to be able to enforce any of those obligations. And there will be serious consequences for people who breach that.

268
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:08,380
And there's there's no buffer over that, so it's it's a daily limit, and they'll be required to comply with that on a daily basis.

269
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,360
好，下一位啦，阿梁繼昌議員。

270
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,880
誒唔該，主席。

271
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:33,170
嗱，我想問一問咧，呢呢個零點七五呢個誒管理費嘅上限係點樣定出嚟？因為咧，我睇翻一啲有關嘅報告，比如O E C D有一份報告《Fees in Individual Account Pension Scheme: A Cross-Country Comparison》咧，呢個零點七五咧都唔係一個即係最最低嘅標準嚟嘅。其實即係我覺得。

272
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:53,180
喺長遠嚟講咧，即係呢個應該係有啊下調嘅空間。我我想即係各方回應一下啦。誒，第二個問題咧，我我想問一問翻頭先關於個opt in opt out嘅問題，大家係咪即係放大咗誒呢一個嘅問題咧？其實如果講緊係一個現有M P F嘅誒。

273
01:01:53,180 --> 01:02:13,190
一個member，而佢係應係啊，實際上係揀咗佢自己嘅嘅投資組合，即係揀咗擺咗喺度剔咗。咁當呢個DIS實行嘅時候，誒，如果你畀一份form佢填，噉佢需唔需要真係再填翻返嚟？如果佢真係唔理唔擺喺度，究竟？

274
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:22,220
究竟即係而家現有呢一大班嘅誒揀咗投資組合嘅朋友會唔會啊受到影響咧？兩個問題，唔該。好，邊位上答？

275
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,470
阿鐘律師。

276
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:44,760
誒零點七五嗰個誒，究竟嗰個誒所謂個基礎喺邊度嚟咧？咁其實我哋喺我哋之前嘅諮詢文件啊，就住投資誒誒預設投資策略嘅諮詢文件第五十五段嗰度咧，都有交代到咧，就係話其實我哋喺二零一二年咧誒做咗一個顧問報告嘅，咁喺個。

277
01:02:44,760 --> 01:03:04,770
報告裏面咧，亦都講咗就係話，知道咧喺誒我哋所謂嘅加權平均基金開支比率咧，裏邊咧誒，我哋當中受託人執行強積金基金行政工作嘅加權平均成本咧，係每年管理資產嘅零點七五percent嚇，所以嗰個。

278
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:09,390
百分之零點七五咧，其實係喺嗰個顧問報告嗰度嚟嘅，嚇。

279
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:18,310
係咪安永啊？consultancy firm嚟，係Ernst Young，係咪Ernst Young report你refering to？係零點七五%。

280
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,840
yeah okay.

281
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:34,750
但係我即係想同啊主席講講咧，其實即係綜觀其他國家嘅誒類似嘅計劃，其實零點七五並唔係一個最低嘅標準啦。噉啊，第二條問題唔該。好，第二條問題。

282
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,400
呃，並未上島。

283
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:57,890
我可以 supplement just the first question too. There were lots of factors that went into coming up with the zero seven five figure. The cost analysis by EY was one thing, but that suggests a slightly higher figure actually. That suggests if administration costs are zero seven five, by the time you add on other costs, the fee level should be much higher than that. But

284
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:17,900
We wanted to set a stretch target for the industry, so ultimately that came down. We also had regard to international practice. International fee comparison is a nightmare to do. I've spent a lot of time trying to do a lot of it, but it's very difficult and very meaningless at the end of the day. But we do have one useful reference which was influential here: that the UK is introducing a very similar fee cap for default products.

285
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:38,170
And they came up with the figure of zero seven five. I think their figure is actually higher than ours because theirs is not as inclusive as ours. But that was a useful reference point. So those sort of factors, there's some arbitrariness in this. But we think it had to be a stretched target. In relation to the opt-in/opt-out question, the member's perfectly right. This

286
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:58,180
this opt out issue only applies to a small subset of members. For the vast majority of members, over ninety percent who've actually made a decision, this doesn't affect them at all. They will get a notice saying if you want to you can choose this new thing, but that will only matter if they actually do something. So for them, both their current benefits will stay where they are.

287
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:18,190
where they are and any new contributions will be invested in their current choice unless or until they change their mind. So for the vast majority of members, this has no impact. The only subset of members we're talking about are those described in subsection DF, which we'll talk about when we come to the clause by clause. And as I said, that's just a small group who.

288
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:34,460
Only invested in the current default and who trustees believe are there because they didn't make a choice. And as identified, there are some exceptions to that even for guarantee funds and people over 60 anyway. So that is a small group. For the vast majority of members, this transitional provision does not affect them at all.

289
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,600
好，下一位啦，阿中國斌議員。

290
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,770
多謝主席。呢個誒管理收費咧，即係大家都。

291
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,430
認為係最大嘅其中一個問題。

292
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,610
噉啊，兩樣嘢，第一樣嘢咧。

293
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:49,860
嗯。

294
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:58,200
即係大家知道，最近有啲報道咧，即係今年嗰個強積金户口平均咧，啲打工仔係損失六千五百蚊。

295
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:11,360
咁即係第一就證明，即係你啲基金經理無論佢賺與蝕，佢都要收呢個費用。所以變咗，正話有人提過咧，就話與呢個表現掛鈎咧，咁呢個即係政府可唔可以考慮？

296
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:31,650
第另外咧，就有啲基金經理同我反映過咧，其中一個佢哋收費貴咧，就因為冇一個叫做中央資料庫，所以變咗佢哋好多時嗰啲打工仔換户口嗰陣時，佢哋要好多行政嘅費用。即係中央資料庫呢樣嘢咧，可唔可以考慮設立咗，就令到咧佢哋即係？

297
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,750
有啲藉口，定話嗰個行政費用高，而令到佢哋做多啲嘢嘅。

298
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:40,530
咁第三樣嘢咧，第三個問題咧，正話有提過咧。

299
01:06:40,810 --> 01:07:00,820
就係話誒零點七五咧，實際上咧就唔係個上限，即係表面好似係上限，但係有好多不同個費用，即係話阿阿鍾小姐有提過，就係話咩印刷費啊、郵寄費啊、核數費啊呢啲噉嘅嘢就唔包嘅。咁呢啲可唔可以包埋在內？噉你可以話喂呢啲錢？

300
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:20,830
錢好似似乎唔係好多錢，但係亦因為到時嗰啲基金經理收費嗰陣時咧，佢寫出嚟佢唔會即係逐條細數寫出嚟，咪就係一個大數。我收到你誒兩誒零點零點兩個percent噉樣。我比較少感覺咧，就好似高鐵噉樣。高鐵咧就話在屆政府話。

301
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:40,840
由香港去廣州總數就係四十八分鐘。哦，原來唔包站嘅，唔包停站嘅。咁呢啲咧就係話，哦，我上限係零點七五，原來又唔包呢樣，唔包嗰樣，所以變咗咧，我覺得即係話政府應該係要將呢啲咧包埋在內。即係如果政府唔包嘅話咧，我會考慮做一條C S四，令到。

302
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,780
爸爸教到。

303
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,950
啊，鍾女士，啊，三個問題。

304
01:07:45,230 --> 01:08:05,240
誒，多謝主席。我先答翻關於誒收費係咪可以同嗰個啊所賺到嘅錢掛鈎啦，或者佢嗰個收益掛鈎啦噉。噉我諗喺我哋而家嗰個誒積金條例啦，或者我哋呢一個噉樣嘅誒條例草案裏邊咧，係誒有。

305
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:22,330
嗰個零點七五嘅規定咧，亦都裏邊究竟係包含咗一啲乜嘢規定？咁誒誒，而喺啊呢一個啊誒設計嗰個誒預設投資策略嗰度咧，亦都係有一啲規定。咁至於你話到誒最後嗰個啊，

306
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:43,580
受託人點樣樣去設計去嗰個預設投資策略，係咪可以誒用頭先阿誒中議員所講嘅嗰個方法，而係令到係符合到我哋呢一個法律嘅誒，即係框架嘅話咧，呢個先至係我哋要睇誒最重要嘅誒誒嗰個係點嚟嘅係啦。

307
01:08:43,580 --> 01:09:03,590
咁誒，我哋就唔會喺個法例裏邊咧特別講到呢零點七五。我哋而家冇呢一個噉樣嘅誒，即係誒誒呢個proposal就係話將嗰個零點七五咧同嗰個誒預設投資策略嘅最後嘅收益啊，或者係掛鈎嘅嚇。咁最終咧，我哋只係希望嗰個誒。

308
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:23,600
受託人咧，可以係符合翻而家嘅積金條例，同埋我哋呢一個係誒條例草案咧裏邊嘅一誒嘅框架咧，係去設計佢哋將來喺嗰個計劃啊，同埋嗰個預設投資策略裏邊嘅嗰一啲即係係仔細嘅誒事情噉樣樣嘅。

309
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:30,690
誒可唔可以包埋？即係零點七五，可唔可以包埋其他費用啊？噉樣啊？

310
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,710
啊，鍾女士，誒，或者我請阿阿馬成信先生。

311
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:57,000
Thank you, Chairman. We consulted explicitly on the basis about capping management fees, and so what the law does is to identify those management fees which are capped. Mr. Chung rightly points out and has set out in the submissions that there are some out-of-pocket things that are beyond that. We we did.

312
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,510
originally struggle with can we put a different cap that includes those types of things? The problem is

313
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:22,800
There are two principal problems why that can't be done, and I don't see it done elsewhere. And that is because fees are predictable and they are a forward promise. So a trustee is capable of setting the fees in a way that is capable of being a promise for the future. So they just set them, be it their fees and the other service providers, in a way that doesn't get over that zero seven five on the.

314
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:42,810
daily basis，the problem with the expenses is they're fact specific，so they might only arise in certain circumstances which are actually outside the trustees' control. Trustees，the funds will incur some costs in making changes to implement this law. They didn't know that a year ago，so that is something that is a not a daily thing.

315
01:10:42,810 --> 01:11:02,820
所以會有要要求完全重構這個每日費限額，而且是不可預測的。而每一個其他那些都是不是在必要內在受託人控制。有些是，例如審計費，他們可以談判這個。但大多數，例如法律、自掏腰包、郵費，都是在不可預測的方式出現，因此不能包括。

316
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:09,870
included in a daily fee cap, it would require a completely different model to build those in, and probably a completely different figure.

317
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:30,160
The second question on the central database, yes, we accept that reducing the cost of administration is an important part of keeping fees down, and the authority is working at the moment to look at ways of centralising any of the data or operational features in a way that can reduce costs. An important issue is how that then translates to lower fees for members, reducing costs.

318
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:39,380
providers is one thing, and just going back to the issue about performance fees. Performance fees are not necessarily

319
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:53,860
not permitted under this proposal. It could be possible that someone could have a performance fee within that 0.75, but logically it can only relate to the investment management side. Administrative activities are not related to performance, so

320
01:11:54,140 --> 01:12:14,150
Trustees still have to process the contribution, send out the forms, deal with the complaints, have a call centre, deal with withdrawals, manage offsetting, do all these things regardless of performance. So that part is completely unrelated to performance, and we couldn't have the situation where they just stop providing those services because they've reached a certain performance is negative.

321
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:28,420
但係， not beyond the realms of possibility that the part of it that relates to the remuneration for the investment manager, which is within the .seven five, could be related to performance. Structurally, that might be a little difficult, but it is conceivably possible.

322
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:44,480
主席，我係有冇有冇時間畀我跟進定要排隊？誒，排第二輪啦，好唔好啊？因為有幾位都等緊。誒，第一輪嘅仲有梁家傑議員。誒，多謝主席。首先我多謝今日誒出席我哋呢個公聽會嘅所有嘅朋友啦，同埋組織啦。

323
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,880
嗯。

324
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:50,180
嗱，主席，其實咧呢一個誒。

325
01:12:51,210 --> 01:13:11,220
噉嘅即係組合基本組合嘅安排咧，我覺得唯一有一點咧，就係我想搞清楚啊。就係譬如而家，如果照阿馬承信先生頭先講咧，即係只有有少數人受影響，我唔係好聽得明白嗰個少數人係。

326
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:22,520
點樣嘅嗱？譬如而家有啲打工仔咧，噉佢參加呢一個強積金，而佢咧係冇選擇到投資組合嘅。

327
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:38,490
咁究竟佢嗰啲錢咧，嗰啲公款去咗邊嘅先？即係我嘅理解咧，即係而家未有而家呢一個新嘅安排之前咧，佢哋係去咗一啲即係保本啊，最即係穩陣。

328
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:47,650
嘅即係有保證，你嗰個誒本金唔會係有損失嘅嗰啲極低風險嘅。

329
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:51,220
誒組合嗰度嘅，首先我想澄清呢度係唔係啦？

330
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,350
噉啊！如果真係噉嘅話咧，其實呢一個。

331
01:13:54,630 --> 01:14:01,800
條例咧，其實係令到呢一個情況改變咗嘅喎，因為咧呢一個誒。

332
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,990
噉嘅組合咧，其實基本組合咧。

333
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:26,280
其實係幾複雜下嘅，即係佢又要同你年齡掛鈎，咁又要係當你嗰個誒承受嘅風險咧，你越後生咧就承受越高，咁咧同你投資落去一啲比較高啲風險嘅組合噉樣，咁其實。

334
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:34,600
其實咧，呢個係改變咗而家嘅現狀啊嘛！即係我，我諗我要搞清楚呢一點先，因為頭先講得有啲唔清唔楚啊。

335
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:54,890
咁如果真係噉嘅話咧，就我諗即係好似頭先我哋聽阿夏哲偉先生講咧，就唔係冇理由嘅，即係佢話你唔應該喺嗰啲打工仔誒不知情嘅情況之下咧，係令到佢由而家一

336
01:14:54,890 --> 01:15:14,900
個即係差唔多係完全冇風險嘅組合咧。你夾硬要佢加入去呢一個所謂D.I.S.啊，嚇呢個係有風險嘅。噉我想聽清楚啊，馬先生可唔可以講清楚，或者中文嚟女士可以講清楚。我頭先嘅理解係啱唔啱？誒，其實呢一個誒見。

337
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:25,650
建議嘅草案係有一個咁根本嘅改動嘅咧，主席。好，阿鐘女士，你係咪想答話先？或者哦，你畀馬順先先上答，哦，馬先生。

338
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,550
Thank you, Chairman.

339
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:47,870
at the moment, Mr. Loon is right. Each scheme has its own rule about what happens to people who don't give instructions, and they're all different. So at the moment, of the thirty-eight schemes, twelve use a mixed asset fund that is some equity, some bonds. Twelve use the conservative fund, the most conservative option. Six use a guarantee fund. Four use target date.

340
01:15:47,870 --> 01:16:07,880
或Lifecycle strategies， a bit like what we're proposing， to use another type of money market fund， to just spread it across all the constituent funds in the scheme. So it's a bit all over the place. Actually， where the risk lies depends on the scheme， so they're all different at the moment. It is perfectly correct though that by moving people that will

341
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:27,890
change the risk for those either upwards or downwards, depending what sort of fund they're coming from. The logic for that is, you know, we think that is consistent with if we're going to the trouble of coming to a consensus on what is the right strategy for someone who doesn't make a decision, why not apply that to the people who haven't made decisions in the past, albeit.

342
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:48,010
with the opportunity to give them some notice about what's happening, so that they are not totally in the dark in relation to that. But accepting that we're dealing with a category of people who generally don't or won't want to make a decision. If they make a decision, that's good, and they'll they'll certainly be provided with all the information necessary to help them make a decision. If that's what they want to do, we know.

343
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,730
從國際實踐，那

344
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:52,670
when presented with that sort of choice.

345
01:16:52,950 --> 01:17:12,960
The majority people actually don't want to make a decision because quite rightly they struggle with what is the right answer here. If someone's gone to the trouble of defining what is the right investment approach or the preferred or best average fit solution here, people tend to default to that because this is a very difficult decision. Academically and in theory, it's a difficult decision. What is

346
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:32,970
The right strategy. So, having gone to the trouble of developing consensus, we can't say it's objectively perfect, but we can say this is the best developed consensus solution for those who don't make decisions. There is a reason in principle why it ought to apply to those people, both as a matter of principle and as a matter operationally. There are also issues about

347
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:52,980
How will these ever get scale if it only applies to new people and new accounts after commencement starts? And that's an issue. The scale issue is one that's been raised in other contexts。主席啊，多謝啊馬長順先生個澄清啦。我相信咧，我哋呢個草案委員會咧，跟住落嚟咧，可能個討論嘅焦點咧，都係即係究竟呢個所謂。

348
01:17:52,980 --> 01:18:05,720
你冇選擇係咪？你自動所謂opt-in啊嚇，即係呢個討論啦。同埋咧，我相信就係誒，可能呢個d i s咧，究竟係咪？

349
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:24,690
而家政府建議嗰個噉嘅組合咧，係咪最好？對於呢一啲誒，佢哋唔去真係自己主動去選擇嘅誒參與者咧，係咪最佳嘅一個安排？我相信我哋都要，我可能佢哋要提供多啲資料先得呢度啊。好。

350
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:34,890
就誒，阿張女士都聽到啊，即係議員都希望提供多啲資料啊，即係覺得背後嗰個決定有啲咩考慮嚇。

351
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:39,760
就誒第一輪嘅，如果哦第一輪誒。

352
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:50,620
梁國雄議員五分鐘嚇。啊，多謝主席，因為喺隔離都有會開。嗱，其實我覺得強誒呢個誒強積金計劃，如果再檢討嘅話咧，

353
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,770
就應該係大刀闊斧噉樣進行改革㗎啦。

354
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,450
因為喺開頭。

355
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:00,390
成個呢個誒？

356
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:19,800
強積金嘅計劃咧，其實一個妥協嚟嘅，係咪？即係當年喺誒回歸之前，因為要解決一啲我哋人口開始老化而出現嘅退休嘅問題咧，係做咗一個妥協嘅。咁而家大家都承認嘅，當年為咗。

357
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,740
誒。

358
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:36,300
呢個誒中國政府驚住呢個誒英國人咧係做一個制度咧係不可維持嘅，咁所以咧就反對咗佢哋建議嘅誒，即係呢個老人金嘅制度。

359
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:45,860
咁而亦都為咗要誒爭取呢個誒資方嘅同意咧，就所以咧就有對沖嘅制度，即係話咧。

360
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:53,200
佢哋喺同意成一個新制度嘅時候咧，佢哋會睇到中間有啲利益咧可以攞翻嘅。

361
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,430
咁而至於盧芳嚟講，更加係冇嘢講咧嗰陣時，因為點解咧？嗰陣時。

362
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:11,660
喺立法會即係嗰陣時嘅立法局裏邊，直選嘅人都少，而實際上面直選嘅議員裏邊係勞工界嘅都少。

363
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:17,110
啊！功能團體裏邊嘅勞工議員。

364
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,440
係競盤沒值嘅啫嘛，求其嘅啫嘛，喺工人團體。

365
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,950
裏邊即係當年嘅工人團體裏邊。

366
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,700
爐即係好明顯係用爐方。

367
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,370
即係用呢個誒勞工。

368
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:36,840
嚟出選嘅呢一個工人團體嘅議員係相當少，其他嘅工人界別相當多。

369
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:42,480
咁所以，如果到而家嚟講，再話修修補補咧，係冇意義嘅。

370
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:52,430
係咪？第一我就我都唔明點解一個政府去強逼人哋去儲蓄嘅，無論係資方或者勞方都好。

371
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,080
點解政府唔係誒承擔嗰個誒呢個？

372
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:07,880
誒管理嘅責任嘅咧，或者唔係有一個誒保證，就係話只要你肯聽我政府講去儲錢嘅時候，你個回報。

373
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,820
係會得到一定嘅保障嘅咧。

374
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,890
嗱，呢個問題係到今日政府都。

375
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,260
冇答到嘅。

376
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,090
而家嘅政策咧，就係。

377
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:25,000
負責去管理強積金嘅基金嘅公司咧，從中漁利。

378
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,170
而家我哋又哦，賠得太犀利啦，不如～

379
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:37,600
政府發明嘅產品啦，或者喺市場嗰度做一隻產品出嚟畀嗰啲唔想搏嘅勞工階層啦，根本呢個就係廢話嚟嘅。

380
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,410
因為如果我哋，

381
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:49,100
誒喺呢個誒管理我哋嘅誒政府嘅誒盈餘啊，或者儲備嘅時候咧。

382
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,670
如果我哋係用呢一個誒金管局嘅方法，

383
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:58,110
去攞收入嘅時候，個回報率。

384
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,120
係穩定嘅。

385
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,550
而係畀。

386
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,560
而家呢一個。

387
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:10,140
嘅誒誒誒誒，用用呢一個基金嘅方法。

388
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:12,890
係高嘅。

389
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,340
咁政府已經用緊啦。

390
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:20,640
係咪？任志剛或者而家陳德霖睇多飯會唔會死咧？

391
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,460
呢個佢唔政府又唔使答嘅喎。

392
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,490
咁好簡單，就係話哦。

393
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:34,500
老闆去對沖嗰個利益不可以逆轉，因為咧佢當年。

394
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:38,990
話喂，我如果你我畀五個percent相沖，我一定要對沖。第二。

395
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,740
個業界嘅利益又幫佢受損。

396
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,920
咁最後屘受損嘅一定係勞方㗎啦。

397
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,630
係咪啊？咁如果你話梁振英真係要改要改革嘅？

398
01:22:50,210 --> 01:23:10,220
第一，你咧就廢除個強積金；第二，如果你唔廢除強積金嘅時候，梗係正本清源，就係話第一，你政府履行嗰個責任就係話，既然而家係立法強逼人哋儲蓄嘅話，你要對嗰個去儲蓄嘅人有一個期許，就係第一佢嘅儲蓄係不會越嚟少，第二唔會受到無無理。

399
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:22,280
你嘅中介費用，第三就係政府作嘅責任。既然間你喺金管局管理嗰啲我哋嘅儲備嘅時候，行之後嘅方法，點解唔可以用嚟惠及三百幾萬嘅打工仔咧？

400
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,710
佢達唔到嘅。

401
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,770
所以根本就係界別。

402
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:32,850
就係反映咗呢個立法會裏邊功能團體嘅利益嘅啫嘛，冇其他嘢㗎啦。

403
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,790
所以我我嘅講法就係應該徹底改革。

404
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,950
政府承擔佢嘅責任，一係就廢除，一係就承擔佢嘅責任，就咁簡單。

405
01:23:42,990 --> 01:24:03,000
好呢個係阿梁國雄議員嘅意見嚟嘅嚇，噉就跟住第二輪咧，又有四位咧係想要求要繼續誒發問嘅。噉我講講個次序啊，就係鄧家彪、陳建波、鐘國斌同埋梁繼昌。噉我哋繼續咧係用五分鐘嘅時間嚇，噉就鄧家彪。

406
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,530
在席咧，我哋請阿陳建波議員。

407
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:25,820
好啊！我想問一問阿彭寶林先生啊，因為彭寶林先生係誒，大家基金界好好資深嘅人員啊。我想佢講講睇，你睇一睇一提到嗰零點七五個嗰個嗰個百分比咧。咁咧，我想畀你，你都畀啲意見咧，即係因為我都要比較，即係個，因為好多時人哋覺得個基金經理收最多噉樣，但係大家知道咧，零點七係包埋嗰啲行政費啊。

408
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:45,830
即係話，如果行政嗰個強積金行政嗰個程序太太複雜咧，亦都唔自動化咧，其實嗰度都要有啲費用啦。咁另外，當入邊有啲基金費用啦，但係你都要個基金費用都要同嗰個零售嗰基金費用差唔多先得㗎噉樣。噉你對嗰個零點七五或者你可唔可以講講有咩睇法咧？係咪都差唔多啊？定係爭好遠啊？定點咧？當然好多人都講咧，就話好。

409
01:24:45,830 --> 01:25:05,840
睇你個計劃嘅，即係譬如你話澳洲嗰啲或者芬蘭嗰啲，佢已經係有幾十年嘅，嗰嚿錢大到不得了，咁嗰個比例當然係會低啦。咁但係如果香港嘅，噉你根本係個咁咁後生嘅計劃，得嗰十十幾年，噉啊亦都會即係個慢慢都會降低。你可唔可以同我哋講講係對呢個嗰個零點七五嗰個睇法點？

410
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,150
啊！

411
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:26,440
啊，彭寶林先生，好啊，誒，主席，誒，主要咧就首先講唔講退休金先啦。一般香港啲認可嘅基金咧，就如果股票基金咧，通常係一個percent至到二點幾係最最高嘅。咁包括曬所有嘅費用，就唔係正話所講咧，淨係個管理費嘅。咁如果係債券嘅基金咧，一般係。

412
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,240
零點五。

413
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:47,530
個percent左，有至到最多一個percent，亦都係包括曬所有嘅費用嘅。咁但係當然咧，就係強積金就嗰個誒size同埋體積咧。雖然我哋成立唔係好耐，由二千年到而家，但係事實上咧都係大嘅。咁所以嚟講咧，個費用係係應該係由即係而家係一路有下調嘅空間。

414
01:25:47,530 --> 01:26:07,540
咁落到幾多咧？我哋覺得，所以我哋覺得咧，就係如果你要係真係平嘅話，又好咧。我哋就所以點解我哋專資會就提議就話，你只能夠一個用一個指數基金啊！指數基金就好似盈富基金噉樣，咁啲基金即係譬如話，佢第一個股票有派。

415
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:27,550
息啦，咁亦都係令到嗰個減低咗嗰個誒誒費用開支嗰個比率啦。咁呢方面咧係係最好嘅，同埋咧就亦都係喺美國有啲好多統計。如果你係美國嘅基金咧，長期跑贏嘅股市咧，當然主動基金係有嘅，但係個比。

416
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:47,560
比例好細啊，得大概兩成左右。但係，如果你係指數基金咧，如果個費用低嘅時候咧，有誒做得好嘅可以跑贏噉。所以咧，變咗我哋覺得，如果真係做到零點七五咧，係可能係要即係包括曬所有費用嚇，可能係真係要指數基金先得，即係話。

417
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:57,220
將來嗰個誒組合嚟講，大部分係指號指數基金，或者我哋嗰個誒size個體積咧，就就好大嚇，先可以做得到。

418
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:18,120
好噉，我我另外咧就想問一問政府咧，就係話誒，而家你已經講咧嗰個誒所謂嗰個費用係不斷下調啦，大概一點六啦，而家嚇噉。但係我又聽好多誒，即係服務提供者講咧，其實佢哋嗰個成日佢有折扣畀個客户嘅。噉我想問你，政府會唔會考慮點樣去做翻一個真正嘅？

419
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:38,130
做出嚟咧，即係話誒，你而家計嗰個平均嗰個開支比率啦。但係可唔可以做一個實實際際所謂淨嘅開支比率咧？即係折扣之後嗰個數咧噉樣。因為啲同我講咧就話可能嗰個折扣可能有十幾二十percent嘅，咁即係話如果一點六咧，可能其實係一點四啊，或者甚至更加低。噉我希望你政府可以盡快咧係要考慮即係。

420
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:58,140
公佈翻呢兩個數字，你可以將每一家公每一間公司都要求佢公佈佢嘅數，即係佢嘅數字啦。然後你整合噉樣公佈，你唔需要每一間公司公佈㗎，等佢有即係自己覺得做生意都放心啲啦。但係你可以整體一個市場嗰個數字，就令到大家咧對嗰個強積金嘅制度更加理解啊，即係個正確嘅數字去評論究竟你個費係。

421
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:04,890
高啊低咧，噉我諗呢個係一個方向，同埋即時可以做到嘅。噉啊，希望誒政府都考慮，或者緊資金都盡快考慮。

422
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:09,910
好，阿鍾女士可唔可以做呢樣嘢咧？嚇，可以提供啲資料嚇。

423
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:30,070
好就誒翻返嚟啊，鄧家彪議員啊！啊，多謝主席。誒，真係唔好意思，因為今日同聲有三個會噉啊，有個係破產嘅條例，有個係福利，所以其實個個雙重性都好高嘅，要走嚟走去。咁但係無論如何咧，誒都係對於我哋一直好關心嘅，繼續即係個討論。

424
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:50,360
嗯，第一咧就嗯頭先所講點樣可以將佢嗰個收費盡量係明確係零點七percent就零點七percent。當然即係我喺即係書面嘅問題裏面都得到你哋嘅一個推算嘅澄清，就係話。

425
01:28:50,360 --> 01:29:10,370
話呢啲管理費以外嘅其他開支係啲基礎投資項目嘅開支，誒亦都好多係睇落去同行政有關嘅買賣成本啊、交嘅税啊、一啲印刷，噉啊約零點二percent，但係呢個零點二嘅percent其實係已經。

426
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:22,970
存在喺建立咗一段十零年嘅整體強積金嘅一個平均數，對於一個新成立嘅DIS。

427
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:43,900
點會係零點二percent啊？因為呢啲聽落去似一啲固定嘅開支成本，你唔會話我一開始成立個基金都嗰幾廿億噉，我嗰個呢啲固定開支就會隨住呢個幾廿億嘅規模咧，再縮翻細。我估唔會嘅，所以你哋實質有冇一個推算咧，就係零點七？

428
01:29:43,900 --> 01:30:03,910
七五percent嘅管理費以外，其他嘅實質開支，第一，你哋可唔可以再補加張詳盡嘅清單，究竟係乜嘢？第二，係咪真係零點二嘅percent咁少咯？除非呢一個嘅核心基金嘅做法係歸一咗去一個好。

429
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:23,920
好大嘅基金五百幾六百億噉，我信啦，可能更低添，因為規模效應嘛。而家你又唔採納呢個方向，搞翻畀十五個受託人去做，就冇咗規模效應。係咪真係守得住都係零點二咧？同埋呢個零點二percent係咪持續都係零點二percent？定係其實有個趨勢，除咗個規？

430
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,840
規模越大，應該會越少，唔該。

431
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,270
誒，邊位先答？

432
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:50,270
誒，主席誒，張律師嗰個收費咧，誒嗰零點二，即係話所謂嗰啲實付開支咧。頭先啊，誒馬生都有講過咧，就係話誒，其實誒呢個係可能係喺一個年裏邊發生啦。咁同埋咧，係會需要係有啲滯後嘅。噉啊，另外就係。

433
01:30:50,270 --> 01:31:10,280
講到就話，我哋有冇方法可以去啊，即係話將呢啲實付嘅數究竟係幾多？誒誒，係講出嚟咧噉。其實咧，而家就算係喺而家我哋呢個制度底下咧，佢哋呢個所謂嘅誒，我哋叫做FPR咧，佢哋都係需要公佈㗎啦。噉樣樣咁誒，就唔。

434
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:30,290
係話誒，而家係唔知嘅，咁其實而家係知嘅，嚇噉樣樣。咁誒，至於你話誒，我哋可唔可以就住將來嘅誒DIS，究竟係預測呢個零點二係會跌啦，定會係高咧？咁頭先講過有一啲實付開支，可能係因為佢要成立嗰個誒預設投資策略。

435
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:50,300
嗰兩個基金咧，係會係需要牽涉咗嘅。咁亦都咧係因為係一個百分比噉樣樣去計咧，跟住嗰個誒，即係嗰個資產值。咁所以喺個資產越多咧，阿誒，鄧議員講得係啱嘅，就係話個資產越大嘅話，其實呢個數係會跌嘅。咁但係我哋都知道咧，就話要。

436
01:31:50,300 --> 01:32:10,310
時間啲人咧嗱，起碼我哋嘅過度安排都已經要時間啦。要啲人慢慢去參加嗰個誒預設投資策略咧，嗰個數咧先至可以拉平均地噉樣咧係跌。但係我哋預計咧嗰個數應該係當嗰個誒預設投資策略嗰筆錢越滾越大嘅時候咧，理論上嚇嗰個數係。

437
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:13,650
會呢啲噉樣嘅所謂嘅誒誒誒。

438
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:18,400
呢啲資誒開支咧，其實係會跟住下跌嘅，嚇。

439
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:39,030
好啊！我好快去追問，即係都係呢一個範疇啫，就係話第一都係希望你哋有個清單咧，話畀我哋聽咧，即係管理費以外，即係不受管控嘅管，即係一啲開支，嗰啲名目現時究竟係有幾多個噉嘅，即係？

440
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:48,960
項目咧，第一，第二有幾多係每年都要去即係畀嘅？有幾多係一筆過嘅？淨係成立嗰一刻要畀嘅啫。

441
01:32:49,240 --> 01:33:09,250
咁第三就係可唔可以做啲比較咧？即係現有咁多股債混合基金，你可唔可以嚟拎其中一隻？可能佢個資產規模係我亂噏話，可能係五十億嘅啊。可能佢個開支比係一點五嘅。咁有幾多係管理費？有幾多係其他不受管控？起碼我畀我哋委

442
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,090
議員都知道現實係點啊！如果唔係，真係。

443
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:19,330
我驚呢個咁大嘅缺口係令到成個政策出台好尷尬咯。

444
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:21,980
係，啊，邊位先生答？

445
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:28,990
邊位想答？馬成尚先生，If I'm not mistaken，I think。

446
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:40,700
The last question is answered in para 15 of the answer provided. We have. Let me try to explain what the maths behind this is. This 0.20% figure is accurate.

447
01:33:41,110 --> 01:34:01,120
within its context, what it is is a manual analysis of the difference between the FER figure for funds and the disclosed management fee figure. Finding that disclosed management fee figure is a very labour-intensive process because we have to add it up not just at the constituent fund level, but at all the funds that it invests into. So there's

448
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:21,130
There's a lot of manual work to do that, but as best we can do that, it is zero two zero at para fifteen. We've tried to do to answer the exact question that Mr Tang just posed that there is a difference in scale. Of course, a lot of these are fixed fees. Legal costs don't vary depending on the size of your fund, nor do audit costs. And looking at mixed asset funds, those over one hundred un

449
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,770
Under 100 million dollars.

450
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,430
those other expenses were calculated at point thirty two.

451
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:42,770
rather than twenty points. For those over at the other end, the really big ones, the ones over ten billion dollars, had an average of only zero one four. The average across the whole group of mixed asset funds is zero two zero, though, the same as the system average. And that's how we came up with those figures.

452
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:46,660
好，誒，下位啦，中國賓議員。

453
01:34:47,060 --> 01:35:07,070
多謝主席，都係相同嘅問題啫。阿馬生有提過咧，即係當然有好多嘢係不預不預計得到嘅費用啦。咁但係即係鍾小姐有啲例子，始終都係佢講嚟講去都咩郵費啊、影印費啊、咩政府費用啊、核數費啊，呢啲畀人嘅感覺唔係係好好大嘅銀碼或者龐大嘅數。

454
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:07,750
好字。

455
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:28,040
咁即係呢個係唔係真係誒喺一開始嗰陣時就唔可以豁免咗佢，或者包含在喺嗰個零點七五裏邊咧？尤其是即係你嚟睇下，如果喺英國嘅例子咧，最終呢啲預設嘅投資基金咧，有七成嘅誒誒市民係會走咗去嗰度。

456
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:48,050
即係，如果你講緊七成有六千幾億嘅，你變咗七六四二四成四千幾億嘅咁嗰個咁大嘅數字嚟講咧，係咪呢啲所謂嘅油費、影印費咧，係不能包括在內？咁另另外，正話有一個問題就未答嘅係一個中央資料庫啊，呢個可唔可以成立咗，令到嗰啲管理公司？

457
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:56,040
佢唔可以再有啲藉口，就話喂嗰啲嘢係太零散，冇一個中央嘅資料，我哋可以。

458
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:01,250
揾唔到嘅，咁令到佢哋又多啲理由去收收高啲嘅管理費喎。

459
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:05,060
誒，邊位想再補充下，再解釋下？

460
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:25,850
不如講咗嗰個誒公共誒嗰個所謂嘅中央資料庫嗰個嗰個誒嗰件誒嗰個我哋講先咁嗱誒，其實咧，我哋誒喺誒誒喺誒立法會嘅誒誒其他嘅誒事務委員會裏邊咧，都有誒簡單。

461
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:31,070
都之前交代過咧，就話我哋其實而家做緊一個咧，係誒。

462
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:51,620
啊！E.M.P.F.嘅即係一個噉樣嘅啊，所謂嘅電子平台啦。咁誒，我哋都希望咧，而家其實啊啊，資金局咧，佢哋已經幫我哋咧係誒，即係啊完成咗誒，即係誒前半部分嘅誒顧問嘅報告。咁咧就誒，而家咧就住一啲。

463
01:36:51,620 --> 01:37:05,680
即係仔細點樣樣去誒誒誒落實嗰個誒誒嗰個計劃咧？而家佢哋在做緊一啲仔細嘅研究嘅，噉我哋希望盡快咧，嗰個係會有一啲資料可以畀到大家啦嚇。有冇有冇時間表啊？

464
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:13,350
誒，我哋其實係誒希望都會喺誒誒誒呢一年。

465
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:25,990
裏邊我哋會有一啲，即係啊，積金局可以有一啲資料話到畀我哋政府聽，究竟點做，噉我哋政府先至再有一個決定，即係就住佢哋嘅啊，畀我哋嘅報告再研究一下噉。

466
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:29,020
好，阿梁繼昌言。

467
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:40,310
誒，多謝主席。嗱，而家呢個安排底下咧，就每一個嘅受託人咧都可以成立一個DIS作為一個Constitution Fund。

468
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:56,910
嗱，咁如果即係你哋有冇限制話，究竟一個受託人可唔可以啊成立多過一個DIS？因為即係你都知，而家每一個受託人可能下底都有即係兩三個唔同嘅誒MPS scheme嘅。我我要提個問題啊，唔該。

469
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,990
誒邊位想答？

470
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:14,250
誒，其實喺而家我哋誒誒條例草案裏邊第三十四D B條裏邊咧，就講到每一個嘅誒核准受託人咧，佢嘅註冊計劃底下咧，係會需要提供一個嘅預設投資策略嘅。

471
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:34,760
即係即係，你係計一每一個註冊計劃底下噉。即係我我我都提出質疑咧，因為好多好多同事頭先都講咗，你都冇咗個個synergy嗰effect，因為你你即你個冇個pull，你個即係投資個誒嗰個投資個金額係可能真係唔係咁大嘅時候，你嗰個誒管理費。

472
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:54,770
係等等咧，其其實都係會係即係會偏高嘅，因為你個pool就越大，應該個管理成本越低。所以，我覺得呢一個政府應該諗一諗。因為最初誒，我諗做諮詢嘅時候都問過好多問題，就話究竟係一個啊，亦話得幾個啊？咁而家你每一個註冊計劃都整一個咧，我。

473
01:38:54,770 --> 01:39:10,660
我又覺得真係好好奇怪咯。嗱，再退而求其次，你睇下，咪每一個只係選每一個信託人，整一個咧，咁即係你有好好多唔同嗰個嗰個選擇㗎嘛？咁點解你到最後會選擇咗一個每個註冊計劃底下一個咧？

474
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:21,380
係，有咩解釋？或者我請阿馬生講下嗰個我哋預計嗰個實際操作情況咧，會唔會係有啲所謂頭先阿梁生所講嘅synergy啦？嚇。

475
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:23,720
好啊，馬成信先生。

476
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:44,130
Thank you, Chairman. The question is a good one, which has troubled us all the way through this development process. The starting point, though, is that each scheme has to have a set of rules about what happens if they don't get instructions. So there has to be a solution at every scheme level. Structurally, the law requires money to be allocated between constituent funds. So that solution is constituent funds.

477
01:39:44,130 --> 01:40:04,140
每一個方案，Mr. Long is right that some providers provide more than one scheme. How they invest that and pool that is a different question. And we would fully expect that a provider who has multiple schemes and they're actually working to reduce the multiplicity of those at the moment, but to the extent they have multiple schemes, they should be looking for pooled solutions at the investment level to.

478
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:19,360
to achieve the economies of scale. Beyond that, we're encouraging providers of different schemes to look at common pool solutions, so that we don't have multiple investment pots, and so we do have a chance of achieving the economies of scale that Mr Long refers to.

479
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:40,090
O.K.好誒，主席，我諗我轉一轉個個話題咧，就講翻個個對沖嗰個問題。頭先啊，自由黨啊，陳生咧，陳浩廉先生就講咗一個嘅嘅嘅study就話咧誒，如果取消咗對沖咧，就好大部分嘅中小企誒就會轉型。

480
01:40:40,090 --> 01:41:00,100
違規呢樣嘢咧，咁究竟呢一個嘅誒，即係誒資料嗰個下低有啲乜嘢嘅最最最基本嘅一啲假設，即係講轉型違規，你係咪講緊全部所有嗰箇中小企嘅僱員立刻係離職啊？咁？

481
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:06,120
你你講緊盈同虧係咪講緊一年咧？一個數年，我我想多少少資料唔該啊。

482
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:26,410
陳浩廉先生，好，咁嗯，首先嗰個嘅轉盈違規意思，其實就係話佢會係個誒operating，即係嗰個嘅營運嗰個嘅啊，以一個年度計咧，係會啊虧蝕而唔賺錢啦。咁至於啊，佢如果有呢個情況出現咗之後，其實。

483
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:46,420
當其時嗰個誒報告或者訪問係冇再問嗰個僱主會做啲乜嘅，因為呢個係一個估算嚟嘅。噉啊，但係我諗喺一個好正常嘅道理去推推敲都會知道嘅。如果嗰間公司本來賺錢，便是前啲後，當然佢會做一啲嘅應對。噉我哋相信就包括佢係咪要縮減佢嘅規模？

484
01:41:46,420 --> 01:42:06,430
甚至乎係咪要會去某個地步要結束佢嘅經營？噉我哋認為噉樣嘅情況下咧，係會削削弱咗我哋香港競爭力，亦都降低咗我哋香港整體嘅生產能力，從而影響我哋經濟發展嘅。啊，我想問一問咧，你你呢個報告係一個你向每一個中小企僱主發出嘅？

485
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:26,440
問卷由佢答你哋，佢認為佢個公司會誒誒轉型為虧啊，亦話係一個誒揾一啲誒獨立嘅機構做一個量化估算，究竟係前者有後者咧？你嗰個報告誒，我想要澄清翻咧誒，我啱講呢個係一個。

486
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:46,450
數據咁呢個數據話呢個所有嘅報告並唔係由我或者我哋個黨自己做嘅，而係轉述翻咧有學者講過呢個數據嘅。係即係你都唔係好清楚，即係究竟嗰個嗰個誒原本嗰個假設係點樣樣，因為都係學者誒做出嚟嘅。係我都係轉述翻誒喺報道上學者講過嘅。

487
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:52,210
同埋佢哋講嘅誒追述，唔該，好唔該，誒，我我夠鐘，我下一次再問。

488
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:59,040
誒第三輪嘅咧就有鄧家彪議員，有冇邊位想問第三輪？噉啊梁繼昌議員。

489
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:09,190
梁繼昌議員，你可以問。喂，冇人啊，冇嚇，唔好意思，我睇唔到鄧家彪唔喺度，原來。

490
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:24,580
即係我想其實咧都睇翻整個強積金嘅即係改革嘅方向咧，咧其實誒好多當然我哋即係議會入邊有好多唔同界別嘅議員有唔同嘅即係睇法或者即係。

491
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:25,760
誒。

492
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:43,910
一啲利益亦都有嗱，咁但係其實咧個對沖啦，其實我我想問一問誒政府咧，如果你要將強徵金呢樣嘢係完全係可以portable，即係可攜性嘅，即係話咧係由僱員去誒。

493
01:43:44,450 --> 01:44:01,470
定奪究竟呢？我係我係買邊一隻強積金，或者係參加邊一個誒註冊計劃時候咧？嗰個對沖，即係話完全取消咗對沖，係咪一個首要嘅誒條件咧？呢個第一個問題。

494
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:02,810
嗯。

495
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:09,870
第二個問題咧，我都想問一問咧，將來嘅誒改革嘅計劃。

496
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:30,160
嗱嗱，其實誒聽到好多唔唔單止係市民或者我哋啲同事都講，強積金其實就即係好多好多嘅嗯，因為收費高啊，或者因為啊市場上嘅波動咧，係會影響到嗯參加者到退休嘅時候誒嗰個啊啊。

497
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,640
crew benefit有幾多？

498
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:51,930
嗱，我我諗即係亦都有聽到其他嘅議員同事講話，好唔好跟翻即係誒，外匯基金嘅投資噉，但係但係實際上睇翻整個個商業環境同埋我哋而家作為一個誒亞洲嘅資產管理中心咧，我我想諗一個大家思考嘅問。

499
01:44:51,930 --> 01:45:02,140
提就係話咧，喺個行政上咧，的確強積金咧係一個高昂嘅一個啊計劃嚟嘅，行政上。

500
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:22,680
噉，但係睇翻個資產管理成個行業嚟講咧，強積金啊，的確係即係亦都有好大嘅貢獻。嗱，我想問一問咧，政府有冇一個好長遠呢個唔唔會係即係呢幾年會做得到嘅嘅長遠嘅計劃，就將整個強積金嘅計劃有一個大。

501
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:42,690
嘅變動，個變動冇即係咩咧？主席，我哋將受託人嗱，當然受託人可能唔係好中意聽我講呢嘢，將個受託人咧係變為一個中央嘅信託人，而下低咧係仍然有翻咁多種唔同嘅投資組合畀啊，我哋嘅誒，即係啲誒市。

502
01:45:42,690 --> 01:46:02,700
市民去選擇嗱，係將個受託人變為一個中央嘅受託人。嗱，呢個改革咧係會即係我諗喺其他國家嘅誒經驗嚟講咧，都係大大個減低咗嗰個行政費用，係一個即係當然係比較一個誒大嘅改革方向咧。我想問。

503
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,780
噉，問政府有冇一啲噉嘅諗法咧？唔該。

504
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,760
好，嗯。

505
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:25,170
鐘女士，兩方面咧，一個就係其實阿梁議員問緊嘅就係嗰個公共受託人啦，另一個就係問全自由行嗰個計劃究竟係點。咁誒，公共受託人，我諗我哋上次嘅條例草案委員會都有講過㗎啦，就係話我哋而家暫時喺而家呢一個階段咧，我哋認為。

506
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:45,460
強誒強積金制度或者呢個預設投資策略咧，係應該由市場營運嘅，就並非係由政府或者係即係公共機構啊或者非牟利組織去營運嘅。咁誒呢個誒私人營運一個強積金制度咧，嗰個討論咧，我估經過好多年啦，即係最終先至係一九九五年係即係。

507
01:46:45,460 --> 01:47:05,470
落實咗以而家呢個形式去進行啦，就話其實成個理念都係透過即係硬性規定，就業人口同埋佢個僱主做供款啦，等佢哋喺工作時可以退休，即係可以誒退一為自己退休生活咧做個儲蓄嘅，噉啊未雨綢繆。二咧就係令公共資源咧可以集中用喺其他有需要嘅人士身上噉。

508
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:10,300
咁誒，其實咧就係話，我想特別指出一點咧，就係話。

509
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:30,590
就住預設投資策略呢個為保護一啲唔唔識得揀或者係冇時間去揀佢自己嗰個誒誒強積金點樣投資嘅誒計劃成員嚟講咧，誒我哋喺做呢樣嘢，由構思到到即係推行個公用諮詢，到到而家拎個草案上嚟誒立法會咧，其實只係用。

510
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:50,600
咗即係兩年幾嘅時間，咁已經係以一個最喺時間上係最快嘅時間，可以咧係我哋睇到嘅喺個強積金制度底下嘅一啲問題咧，盡快係去改咗佢先嘅。咁所以，我哋而家咧係誒冇頭先啊梁議員所講嘅計劃，話要將個預。

511
01:47:50,600 --> 01:48:10,610
是投資策略咧，係由一個公共機構或者政府去營運。至於誒全自由行嗰度誒，我哋都講咗就係話誒，其實我哋而家誒就住呢一樣嘢咧，我哋就係誒進行緊一個叫做啊積金二嘅一個電子平台嘅研究嚇，是否研究佢係。

512
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:30,620
咪可行啦。咁誒，我哋亦都誒希望咧，就係話呢一個推行呢個積金易呢個噉樣嘅係一個電子平台嘅可行性咧，會為日後咧實施全自由行咧係提供一個基礎建設嘅係啦。因為我哋都需要一個噉樣嘅電子平台先至可以做得到噉。

513
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:43,040
積金局或者係政府咧，都仍然需要就住積金二咧，就係做一啲好多詳細嘅研究。而家呢個階段咧，我哋未有推出積金二或者全自由行嘅時間表嘅。唔該，主席。

514
01:48:43,350 --> 01:49:03,360
好，阿鄧家彪議員，多謝主席。誒誒，我喺第二輪提問有個要求啦，即係希望你哋之後可以啊一個書面嘅回覆，就係嗰啲非管理費嘅開支，即係非規管項目嘅開支，究竟有張清單羅列出嚟，而且邊一？

515
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:23,370
啲咧係誒預計一筆過嘅設置嘅，可能呢啲開支有啲邊啲係每一年行上要要花嘅洗費，我希望即係有個清單畀我哋，即係更加掌握嗰個收費管控。日後嗰個真正嗰個實質效果係點樣？因為第一誒，第二咧，對於嗰個誒。

516
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:30,140
即係保交回覆我嘅文件裏面顯示咧，有一個嘅就係保證基金嘅問題。

517
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:50,430
咁而家咧，誒預計推算擺咗落去預設嘅誒基金嘅金額係六百九十六億。咁當中咧，其實一百八十億咧係擺咗落四個受託人底下所開設嘅保證基金。咁喺呢個法例嘅內容係。

518
01:49:50,430 --> 01:50:10,440
唔會自動轉移咧。呢一啲喺保證基金上面嘅錢噉，我但係我再細再細緻去睇咧，呢一百八十億裏面咧無條件保證，即係話咧，其實你轉移我，我估計啊，憑字面推斷係應該唔會有乜嘢額外。

519
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,550
外嘅損失。

520
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:19,210
嘅誒幾隻嘅保證基金咧，其實呢度係佔成一百七十三億。

521
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:32,940
係咪可以都將呢個轉移埋咧？或者加啲特別嘅提示咧？因為即係恕我直言，我對強積金咁多種基金嘅觀察，保證基金係。

522
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:34,480
係好貴嘅。

523
01:50:35,070 --> 01:50:55,080
好貴之餘，而佢個回報的確係保證，不過唔係唔係係偏高，而係偏低嘅。有一啲嘅例子係盜竊嘅。咁當然我唔係講而家第十點裡面所講嘅只基金，而係我觀察到的確係咁多隻保險基金裏面通。

524
01:50:55,080 --> 01:51:05,140
通常個情況係唔理想，又貴，回報唔係咁好。咁所以如果嗰個嘅咁大嘅錢有一百，

525
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:13,770
誒七十幾億擺咗喺兩個受託人底下嘅無條件保證嘅保證基金，係咪都可以做？

526
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:28,670
再諗清楚，做一個轉移嘅處理咧，避免又係雷聲大雨點小啦。原來即係即係呢一個部分嘅，即係佢根本唔想投資、唔識投資嘅打工仔都可以得到即係核心基金保障啦。

527
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:49,490
啊，鍾女士，多謝主席。你靠近呢個麥嗰啲，好啊，大家聽上比較辛苦。其實咧，誒，阿鄧議員，你呢個觀察係啱嘅。咁所以喺我哋而家個條例草案第三十四d j條，即係第八條嘅裏邊嘅而已嘅三十四d j條裏邊咧，就住保證基金咧，我哋係有一個噉樣嘅。

528
01:51:49,490 --> 01:52:09,500
誒安排嘅就係話，如果呢啲噉樣嘅喺屆滿日期，呢啲噉嘅保證基金嘅有關權益嘅市值係少於有關基金喺該日保證會支付與有關成員嘅價值咧，則有關計劃嘅核准受託人不得按照計劃嘅預設投資策略將該等權益係投資。

529
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:13,570
換句話説咧，就即係話，如果佢係會蝕咗錢嘅話咧。

530
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:19,120
誒受託人係會唔喐喺保證基金裏邊嘅錢嘅嚇。

531
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:24,080
咁咁即係話嗰條線畫喺邊度咧？

532
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:44,370
因為受託人佢可以一個好長嘅觀察期，佢點樣做呢個決定？你哋點樣監察到？因為一直以嚟嘅互動話畀佢聽，其實你哋係要好仔細去特定噉樣問受託人啊，你嘅基金轉移情況係點？而佢唔會主動彙報㗎嘛？你點樣處理呢個問題？誒，或者就？

533
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:49,230
住監察誒，我或者請阿馬生誒，再誒誒。

534
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,440
解釋一下，好嘛？好，馬成信先生。

535
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:58,520
Thank you, Chairman. Just to re-explain the objective of this section, it is so that.

536
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:10,100
For most of the guarantee funds set out in the paper, this section won't have application because you'll notice for the big ones you're referring to, they're not conditional.

537
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:20,060
The objective of this provision is that if the value of the guarantee is more than the market value at the date Miss Chung referred to, then

538
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:40,680
The member keeps the benefit of the guarantee. They stay in the guarantee. We don't want to have the situation where the guarantor is let off the hook, so to speak, from the guarantee. So, how many of those get transition will depend on a this market value versus guarantee value analysis, but also whether it's conditional. If the guarantee is payable.

539
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:46,660
In any event, then they will be transitioned because there's no loss of value and.

540
01:53:46,940 --> 01:54:06,950
notwithstanding what the actual conditions are on the guarantee, it may yet be the case that providers will agree to pay up to the guarantee point anyway. So most of those may end up being transitioned. That that can be at an individual provider level as to how to calculate that. The trustees, consistent with the obligation.

541
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:26,960
In their deeds and constitutive documents, have to value the market value and the guarantee value regularly, and that is subject to all the usual due diligence processes and audit processes. So we're confident there are not calculation issues. But this is a new bit of work. When that notice goes out to these people, they will have to. When the notice at the end of that notice.

542
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:38,500
Notice period，做this extra bit of work to figure out is the guaranteed value worth more than the market value， and if it is， the person does not get transitioned even if they have not responded to the notice。

543
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:56,680
哦，即係話誒，會最終係由受託人去做一個誒報告啦，然後就由金誒積金局去睇，究竟佢會唔會係低過，然高於市值，然後就會啓動嗰個轉移，係咪啊？即係簡單嚟講。

544
01:54:57,390 --> 01:55:17,400
馬成尚先生，I don't envisage that the MPFA will play a real-time role in that. We may ask for reporting about that process once it's completed, but the assessment of that on the day, because there could be tens of thousands of them, will be a responsibility of the trustee. We will of course require them to do it correctly, and it's subject to all the normal.

545
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:37,410
due diligence compliance and audit processes, so we're confident that the usual pricing mechanisms within the fund are reliable in that sense. But of course, yes, we we can certainly consider requiring some after the event reporting to confirm how many people were in that category and the extent to which the market value was higher or lower.

546
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:40,240
then the guaranteed value. We can take that suggestion up.

547
01:55:41,150 --> 01:56:00,480
誒，等我標完可以問落去啊，因為個時好誒，即係話誒，我想再問即係仔細啲，就係有條件保證、冇條件保證嘅幾種保證基金個處理係係咪真係咁講？係完全冇分別，都係睇佢報告裏面睇係咪高於市值、低於市值，係冇分別嘅，係咪啊？

548
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,400
馬成信先啊！

549
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:23,650
for those that are unconditional, they can never satisfy the test. The market value will equal the guaranteed value at any point in time. Or sorry, the guaranteed value can't be higher than the market value, so they will be transitioned. That is if the guarantee is honoured. The guarantee can't be worth more than the market value in that situation. So

550
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:43,940
That and I think that is the majority of cases. As I said, we have to look at this in the context of each provider. But we can extend the reporting obligation and the checking obligation to all of them. I suppose it's perhaps not a bad idea that we're not just concerned about those who who don't transition, but we will also look to those who do transition and seek some reporting in relation.

551
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,510
係。

552
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:57,160
誒，我想睇下仲有冇大家有咩跟進嘅問題？如果冇咧，我想睇睇今日誒出席嘅團體代表有冇咩？你哋誒仲想誒再話畀我哋聽嘅咧？

553
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:58,710
有冇？

554
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:15,960
如果冇咧，我哋喺呢度咧就好多謝各位團體代表今日出席我哋誒呢個會係畀意見我哋嘅嚇。噉你可以先行離開。噉我哋咧就誒，我想問下各位嘅意見，我哋嘅會議係應該繼續進行㗎嚇。誒到十二點半嘅啊。

555
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:19,790
咁誒，我想去翻咧，就係。

556
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:26,060
誒，我哋有一份文件，就係立法會誒C B括弧一。

557
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:33,370
三九六斜洞一五至一六零二號文件，嗰份文件咧就係誒。

558
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:45,520
因應委員喺二零一五年十二月十五號會議上，同埋啊，鄧家彪議員喺十二月二十一號嘅信件當中所提及嘅事宜。

559
01:57:45,800 --> 01:58:04,700
就誒政府方面咧，就有個回應噉啊。回應咧都有好幾版紙嘅。噉我想睇睇係咪啊，張女士，你都同我哋誒講講嗰個主要嘅內容嚇。咁然後我哋睇下大家就咩問題啊，想提出好嘛？啊，張女士，好啊，好唔該，主席。

560
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,070
誒。

561
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:11,560
我簡單就個文件嗰度誒講一講啦，咁誒。

562
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:32,000
第一部分嗰度就係話講喺新嘅法定預設投資策略安排生效之後，預計而家冇作出投資誒選擇嘅計劃成員轉移或者係根據預設投資策略誒投資所涉及嘅成員人數或者百分比咧，呢個其實喺文件嘅第二段嗰度咧有誒講到嘅。我想。

563
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:52,010
強調幾點咧？一咧就係話，其實喺而家嘅誒強積金條例底下咧，我哋係並冇規定誒強制性公積金計劃嘅預設投資安排咧係誒究竟點樣做嘅。咁因此咧就係話，我哋嘅核准受託人咧，亦都無需咧就住呢一啲預設。

564
01:58:52,010 --> 01:59:12,020
投資安排誒，即係我哋法例底下嘅DIA咧，就係話係去向積金局咧報計劃嘅成員嘅人數啊、帳目嘅人數啊，或者所涉及嘅累算權益嘅。咁但係因為咧，為咗我哋都知道呢一呢一揸人咧，即係話而家喺預設投資安排底下嘅。

565
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:32,030
誒計劃成員咧，應該就係我哋嘅目標要保護嘅對象啦。咁所以咧，我哋其實為咗實施個預設投資策略，即係我哋嘅DIS咧，係作咗準備咧。我哋其實積金局已經要求咧，係核准受託人咧開始識別嘅程序，即係去揾呢一啲人翻嚟。咁所謂嘅因此，根據呢一樣啦，我哋而家。

566
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:52,040
已經開始準備啦，同埋咧就係話根據二零一五年十月底積金局有嘅資料啦，咁同埋根據翻我哋二零一三年向計劃成員進行嘅一項調查，仲有就係話較早時業界進行嘅一啲調查咧，我哋就就住誒我哋所牽涉嘅誒誒呢啲噉樣嘅啊。

567
01:59:52,040 --> 02:00:12,050
預設投資安排底下嘅誒，我哋估計嘅人數啊，估計嘅户口啊，咁都喺第二段嗰度咧，同埋所牽涉嘅權益嘅錢咧，都已經喺第二段嗰度咧係交代咗。咁誒呢度仲要再強調多一點，就係話咧呢啲數咧係喐嘅，不停噉樣變嘅原因就係話。

568
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:32,060
我哋會有新成員加入啦，而佢哋亦都冇任何嘅投資嘅誒指示啦。咁誒有機會咧，亦都係有成員係會離開嗰個強積金制度嘅。咁同時咧，就係話喺我哋頭先講咗喺誒會之前講咗，話我哋有好多大型宣傳咧，我哋估計咧可能會有一啲嘅計劃成員咧。

569
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:52,070
佢之前係冇作任何嘅誒投資嘅指引嘅。噉，但係咧，佢誒而家可能係因此而誒，我哋叫做瞓醒咗啦。就係話佢可能係會主動提出一啲嘅即係投資嘅安排嘅向佢哋嘅受託人。咁亦都咧誒，頭先喺會度都有講過下咧，就係話誒。

570
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:56,400
其實有一啲誒類別嘅人士咧，我哋係誒。

571
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:16,750
嗰個誒預設投資策略嘅誒呢個安排咧，係對佢哋咧係冇影響嘅。包括就係話喺誒，如果現有嘅計劃成員佢喺條例生效前已經年過六十歲啦，或者係一啲咧佢嘅投資係擺喺保證基金，而因為佢轉移至預設投資策略，會導致佢失。

572
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:36,760
去佢應該有嘅承諾嘅回報咧，呢啲噉樣嘅計劃成員咧，喺嗰個誒，我哋嗰個誒誒誒呢一個預設投資策略底下咧，係估計咧都唔會喺係唔會喺裏邊嘅啦。噉樣咁誒，雖然係咁啦，而家呢啲只係一啲估算嘅數字啦，我哋都預期咧喺即係接。

573
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:56,770
近啲誒二零年二零一六年年中嘅時候咧，核准受託人咧可以提供一啲比較準確啲嘅資料嘅嚇。咁呢個係第A部分嗰個誒，至於第B部分嗰度咧誒，大家就係問到話啊，其他司法官管轄區佢哋誒採用一啲類似啲。

574
02:01:56,770 --> 02:02:16,780
e.i.s嘅計嘅退休計劃嘅誒，即係啊，會係邊一啲咧？咁同埋嗰個佢嗰個誒詳細資料係點樣樣咧？咁咁誒，其實咧就已經喺個文件嘅誒第五段嗰度交代咗嘅。咁誒呢度我先要指出咧，就係話其實咧一個正面直接嘅比較咧係。

575
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:36,790
有困難嘅嚇誒，因為咧就係話佢哋可能係誒所有嘅可能係實施嘅誒細節咧係有唔同啦。咁誒，甚至就係話有啲可能係誒有個法例規定，有啲就只係用一個指引去規定嘅啫。咁誒，所以我哋咧就誒基本上係冇拆析到咧。

576
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:56,800
係採用同香港係一模一樣嘅，我哋而家建議嘅呢套嘅噉樣嘅誒預設投資策略嘅，喺其他司法管轄區我哋揾唔到嘅嚇。縱然係咁啦，我哋都誒揾咗兩個地方咧，就係智利同埋墨西哥咧，就係去誒做誒畀大家咧去睇下，因為已經係即係呢兩個影。

577
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:16,810
係最接近香港個模式㗎啦。咁誒有幾點我想誒即係誒強調嘅喺你呢兩個嘅比較嗰度，就係話誒個基金數目同我哋都係指嘅。咁誒佢哋都喺個預設投資安排底下咧，係多於一個嘅即係成分基金嘅。咁個收費安

578
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:30,110
排咧同我哋有唔同嘅誒，譬如話智利咧，佢哋係用一個計劃成員嘅收入係作為嗰個誒一個百分比去收費嘅。墨西哥就同我哋似啲嚇，佢都係用翻嗰個誒。

579
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:50,570
誒嗰個資產淨值啦，咁但係咧裏邊咧就係唔包咧係嗰啲誒，即係個基礎基金所收嘅費用㗎。咁另外就係話誒個淨誒資產值咧就誒兩個其實都係誒比香港係大好多嘅噉。咁私部分嗰度咧，其實就係大家要求。

580
02:03:50,570 --> 02:04:10,580
關於誒想睇一睇同DIS類似嘅而家一啲混合資產基金咧，佢哋嗰個誒基金開支比率啦，同埋佢個十年嘅年率化回報係點樣樣，同埋個資產淨值究竟係乜？咁呢個喺第六段嗰度咧，我唔我唔再提啦。呢啲只係一啲數字嚇誒，D部分嗰度咧。

581
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:30,590
就大家問到關於就係話誒而家嘅核准受託人係指定嘅誒用一個誒保證基金作為佢哋指定嘅預設投資安排，係個數字係點啊個資產淨值係點，亦都喺第七段嗰度講咗。簡單嚟講就係話，其實而家有四個嘅核准受託人咧，喺七個嘅強積金計劃之中。

582
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:36,630
中咧就採用咗保證基金咧，就作為嗰個預設投資安排嘅。咁誒。

583
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:56,970
頭先亦都係鄧議員都已經講過啦。噉我哋呢度簡單交代咗咧，有一啲咧係有條件嘅保證嘅。啲條件包括就係話可能係要相當嘅一段時間係將個投資擺嗰個誒保證基金裏邊啦，又或者係誒佢哋係等到個成員係退休啊，或者因為誒死亡啊，或者喪失行為能力啊。

584
02:04:56,970 --> 02:05:05,520
啊，等等咧，佢先至可以攞翻啲錢出嚟啦，咁等等。咁另外一啲咧就係無條件嘅保證嚟嘅，嚇噉樣。咁誒？

585
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:26,730
二咧就係話，我哋估計咧喺第十一段嗰度有講啦。採用保證基金作為預設投資安排嘅強積金計劃之下咧，我哋誒粗略嘅估計，根據誒受託人嘅粗略估計咧，大概有廿一萬嘅帳户咧係投資於呢一啲噉樣嘅保證基金嗰度嘅嚇噉樣咁誒。頭先阿馬生佢其實都有交代。

586
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:46,740
到嗰個即係保證基金，究竟嗰個誒嗰個監管安排係點咧？就喺第十二段嗰度。噉我唔喺呢度再睇啦。誒，至於第二部分嗰度咧，就係話講到係誒我哋嗰個收費誒管制啦，就係話除咗係誒即係誒管理費之外，係有冇其他嘅誒？

587
02:05:46,740 --> 02:06:06,750
即係嘅誒費用咧，咁要講咗係誒誒有嘅一啲即係實付嘅開支啦。咁喺第十四段講咗，同埋頭先嘅討論都應該講咗好多，我唔喺呢度再誒即係再誒講啦。咁第F部分嗰度咧，其實就係第十六七段嗰度同埋第十七段嗰度咧，係講咗話誒，我哋而

588
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:26,760
家嘅嗰個係監察嘅權力究竟係點嘅？咁基本上我哋就係話而家嘅一啲調查權力啦，或者係一啲誒要求誒誒客長受託人向積金局提交一啲資料啊、文件啊，誒或者係即係誒要求呢一個誒受託人將一啲性質重要嘅事情通知積金局呢啲噉嘅權力咧。

589
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:46,770
而家呢噉嘅權力咧，都會伸延至到咧將來嘅誒預設投資策略嗰度嘅嚇噉樣咁誒，我哋亦都將咧而家即係話我哋法定嘅誒彙報規定啦，擴展至涵蓋咧呢一個係誒d i s嘅誒佢嘅誒嗰個投資啦、轉移啦、通知啦、收費啦，同埋降低風險嘅規。

590
02:06:46,770 --> 02:06:56,790
規定全部都係即係會擺埋落去噉樣樣嘅。咁誒，我諗我嘅簡介係嚟到呢度啦，嚇。好，唔該。睇下大家有冇咩問題想提出。

591
02:06:57,650 --> 02:07:17,660
誒，鄧家彪議員，多謝主席。即係誒，再問嗰個保證基金係咪，即係話到時如果保證基金嗰個表現出咗嚟，再再同嗰啲即係高於市值嗰個誒做一個報告，噉係咪即係話佢個可能轉移，可能唔轉移呢？係第一，但係如果轉移。

592
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:34,160
係咪會滯後？可能整個核心基金個出台，譬如話，可能核心基金係即係一七年一月，咁會唔會嗰個誒保證嘅基金，如果真係低於市值，係會唔會嗰個轉移係要一年之後咧？即係我想問問具體啲，呢個係一個。

593
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:54,450
誒第二個咧就係誒對於誒一個誒好好概括嘅表咧，就係C段第六點咧，就係話嗰啲股債混合基金裡面嘅誒十年嘅年率化回報。

594
02:07:54,450 --> 02:08:14,460
嗱，當然超出六十percent，甚至係即係去到八八成嘅股票就唔適用嘅。適用嘅應該係投兩個二十至四十、四十至六十，即係比較可以比較到啦。我估即係同而家核心基金嗰個，因為最高都係六成係股票啊嘛。噉我係睇個回報係睇落去係。

595
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:15,840
係穩陣嘅。

596
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:36,260
如果係噉，未來嗰個收費又會低過呢一啲嘅話咧，即係到時可能係三點五，就再即係加翻啲咧多出嘅，即係誒，即係唔使咁多錢嘅開支，就估計可能會更更理想。咁所以我又想問啊，既然睇到個數據咁有信心嘅話，正如頭。

597
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:53,570
先，我哋有列席團喺工聯會講，有啲懲罰機制保下底得唔得咧？即係如果佢嘅表現持續係衰過通脹率嘅，有一啲懲罰罰啲受託人，甚至我覺得係咪受託人根本都冇資格再去做咧？

598
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:55,890
你哋會唔會去諗咧？咁解。

599
02:08:56,530 --> 02:09:16,540
誒邊位上嚟？阿張女士誒誒，我哋而家暫時唔唔會考慮誒。我諗基本上呢個係一個私營嘅誒誒強積金制度啦。咁變咗即係其實係一切由個市場去決定。佢如果個回報率係低嘅話，呢啲係啲公佈嘅數字嚟嘅。噉我相信即係誒。

600
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:31,290
誒個市場會話畀嗰個受託人聽，佢嘅表現不濟，嗰個後果係點樣樣嘅？至於頭先啊，誒鄧議員講關於嗰個實際操作咧，嗰個保證基金嗰度，或者我請翻阿馬生誒交代嚇，唔該。好。

601
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:37,440
Thank you, Chairman. The timing, as I understand, goes to the sorry. The question goes to the timing.

602
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:47,500
The way the timing works is that after commencement, the trustees have six months to send the statutory notice, the specified notice.

603
02:09:49,390 --> 02:10:09,400
Once they send the notice, the member's got forty two days to respond, and it's at the end of that period, that forty two days, that the assessment is made and the comparison between market value and guaranteed value. And if the guaranteed value is higher, the member will not be transferred into the DIs. If they're the same or the market value is

604
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:29,410
higher，then the person will be transferred within 14 days. So there's no delay. Like all other transitions, that same statutory time period applies. So within the six months, the notice and it's 42 days plus transfer within 14 days. No different for guarantee funds. The only difference for the guarantee funds is the test depends on

605
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:49,420
Whether the market value is higher or lower than the guarantee？OK，誒，阿主席，我就係希望即係針局又好，政府又好，對於呢個操作又係用書面做報交嗰個回應。我對於我認為要表現上面咧，即係個積金嘅回報都要加啲懲罰或者管控措施係有必要嘅。

606
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:58,440
即係收費都可以管控，點解表現唔可以加一個保底線去做懲處佢哋咧？咁呢個係我嘅基本睇法。

607
02:10:58,890 --> 02:11:02,320
好，阿鍾女士，可唔可以有個書面嘅回應？

608
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:03,620
因為好。

609
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:23,920
嗯，好啊，好，大家睇下大家仲有冇咩問題啊？孫總監員，主席，我都係問翻第六段嗰度啦。係，其實係咪即係可以理解成咧，將來嗰個誒，當然而家唔係完全誒呢一個第六段嗰個表嗰啲咧，就唔係等於將來嗰個嘅基金啦，但係都相類似啦。我相信你。

610
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:26,510
即係做一個相對比較。

611
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:44,430
直接都係比較，咁如果嗱，因為而家佢個做到咧就係基金嘅開支比率誒比率咧就係即係一點六五個percent，如果二十至四十嘅，跟住四十至六十嘅股比重就係一點七二，咁叻咗咧其實就係二點。

612
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:47,090
誒二八。

613
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:51,560
上面嗰個咧就係都係誒一點幾嘅啫，噉樣。

614
02:11:51,900 --> 02:12:05,960
即係誒都唔夠二，咁其實兩個都打唔到，打唔贏，邊唔贏通脹？係咪咁講啊？叻咗之後，定係你個十年嘅回報率呢個？我冇睇過註冊嗰度，你係叻咗叻咗收費㗎係咪啊？

615
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:18,190
係，誒阿鍾女士，你講清楚嗰個嗰回本嗰個第七嗰個個個註冊嗰度冇講係咩收費嘅，即係三點五四四點七同埋四點四係咪咩咗收費嘅？

616
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,380
係咪？係啊，係啊，正確。O K O K。

617
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:39,540
咁呢個係咪OK？如果係叻咗收費，即係點啊？即係即係即係減豁除收費，噉係咪即係你哋大大體啦？當然啦，就係你我我我知道好多provision，即係歷史嘅回報唔等於將來嘅回報，我清楚嘅啊，我我明白嘅。噉係咪即係有個？但係都從歷史去。

618
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:50,800
去預測係咪即係呢啲嘅回報率係即係相若將來誒嗰個嘅即係所謂你哋講個預設基金嗰個嘅回報咧？

619
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,730
阿鍾女士。

620
02:12:54,460 --> 02:13:14,470
誒嗱誒，我諗誒預設投資策略或者係任何嘅呢啲噉嘅基金咧，回報水平其實都係受個全球資本市場或者係相關投資期嘅表現嘅影響啦。咁所以咧就話誒，我哋最多都只能夠就係話睇相類似。

621
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:34,480
嘅呢啲噉樣嘅混合資產基金嚟到去睇，作為一個啊或者係我哋叫做嘅參考啦。但係我哋都唔明白，明白唔想嘗試喺呢度。即係呢個呢，我我明我一定唔係唔係相約啦，唔係唔係唔係等同啦。即係，但係呢一個你呢個表其實即係誒最近。

622
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:36,180
榜嘅比較係咪咁解啊？

623
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:37,310
好。

624
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,370
好，睇下大家仲冇其他問題。

625
02:13:41,370 --> 02:13:51,220
如果冇咧，我就誒想話誒可以繼續去咧，就係關於個條例草案嗰個具體嘅逐項嘅審議。

632
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:09,480
啊！請啊，張女士。

633
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:16,920

668
02:21:41,550 --> 02:22:01,560
啊，黎生係啊，多謝主席。誒，基本上，如果我哋喺草兒方面嚟講咧，副本就真係只係一個，即係誒，我哋英文所謂嘅誒誒copy啦。即係一個係誒一個有一個正本，有一個副本噉嘅分別。咁如果個文本嘅話，通常我哋就係指佢係誒誒兩份之間都係有一個真確性喺度嘅。噉我哋就唔再分話，即係邊一個係。

669
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:21,570
係一個正本，邊一個一個副本噉嘅用法。噉啊，呢度嚟講咧，我哋覺得係誒用一個所謂誒比較概括啲嘅講法，一個文本咧係比較正確嘅，因為嗰個誒即係所謂嘅文本，亦都係要交出嚟作為一個誒報告嘅咁去處理嘅。啊，多謝主席。咁即係日後核數師作報告時候就要誒兩份。

670
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:31,030
呢兩份都係正式嘅文本嚟，係佢本身都係一個文本嘅意思，都係一個正式嘅誒嘅嘅一個誒文件嘅地位噉樣嘅。多謝。

671
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:37,430
另外嗰個誒講，即係嗰個條文裏邊講到嘅核數師。

672
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:51,610
咁即係第二日咧，就係呢啲DIS嗰啲嘅計劃咧，就即係所謂正話傾到零點七五以外嗰啲費用，係咪就包括要支付呢啲核數師嘅費用咧？定係呢啲？

673
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:53,670
呢啲費用係喺邊度嚟嘅咧？

674
02:22:53,970 --> 02:23:00,130
即係支付核，即係而家喺個條文裏邊所講嘅核數師嗰個費用。

675
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:21,780
啊，主席，呢個咧理論上係就係話，當嗰誒管理局係覺得嗰個受託人冇遵守到係我哋關於DIS嘅一啲法律上邊嘅規定嘅時候咧，佢就會可以要求佢哋咧係安排一個核數師。咁頭先我哋講緊就係話，我。

676
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:39,440
哋誒講嘅一啲核數咧，可能係佢哋平時係需要管理嗰個噉樣嘅誒成個誒成分基金或者係個計劃咧所牽涉嘅一啲核數嘅費用嘅嚇。咁但係呢個核數師嗰個費用到時係應該係。

677
02:23:39,810 --> 02:23:41,020
係邊個畀啊？

678
02:23:43,130 --> 02:23:44,100
啊！

679
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:52,180
呢個都會係其他嘅費用嚟嘅，即係話所謂嘅我哋頭先講嗰啲實付費用啊，係會包咗喺裏邊嘅嚇。

680
02:23:53,020 --> 02:24:07,840
即係話，積金局懷疑到有問題嘅時候，就可能要求呢個計劃就揾一個核數師去再睇一睇。係噉，然後咧呢筆錢嘅費用都係落翻去嗰個誒，即係個計劃裏邊嘅。

681
02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:12,940
好，大家仲有咩問題？

682
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:21,100
如果冇咧，我請啊繼續。

683
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:41,390
咁誒頭先我未讀誒第誒誒誒括弧三同埋括弧四嗰度咧，係誒我哋喺第三十括弧二條嗰度咧，喺第一之後加入呢一個劃一A，因為我哋加咗咧係喺誒括弧一A呢個條文嘅。咁同樣地喺三十括弧三條嗰度咧，我哋都。

684
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:53,600
都喺嗰度係加入咗劃一A嗰度咧，係令到嗰個誒我哋本來加嘅一A嗰度咧，亦都係適用嘅喺呢一個有關嘅誒三十二括弧二同埋三十括弧三條嗰度適用。

685
02:24:56,660 --> 02:25:16,670
好，繼續好咁誒，到到第七條嗰度咧，其實我哋修訂咗第三十三條括弧贊免和終止核准受託人管理誒註冊計劃三括弧嗰度。咁呢個咧係誒成個條文咧，主要咧就係話我哋係將誒而家呢一個可以係誒誒懲處。

686
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:36,680
呢一個啊啊誒受託人咧嘅誒一啲嘅誒誒方法咧，係可以令到咧佢哋係違反咗呢一個誒預設投資策略裏邊嘅一啲規定咧，亦都係適用嘅咁咁誒。第括弧一咧係第三十三喺第三十三括弧一括弧A。

687
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:56,690
呢條嗰度咧，我哋廢除咗個畫字，咁咧就代以咧一個係分號。咁呢個係一個即係誒，我哋喺個誒文字上面嘅改動嚟嘅啫嚇。咁另外咧就係喺第三十三個回一誒B條咧，就廢除個逗號，然後咧就取而代之係咧係一個啊呢個分號，然後咧就係畫。

688
02:25:56,690 --> 02:26:16,700
噉啊，然後咧，我哋因為咧呢個係學要加入咧，就係話第三十三括弧一b括弧b條之後咧，我哋係加入咧就係話誒，該受託人沒有遵守咁呢個咧，其實係同我哋之前咧係誒都誒似嘅，係誒呢一個第誒四條嗰度咧係即係將所。

689
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:30,960
所有同呢一個係誒預設投資策略啊有關嘅一啲嘅誒誒要求咧，係加翻曬落去咧，係致使到呢個罰則係可以做。我唔詳細讀啦，因為嗰度都成誒八行嘅主席嚇。

690
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:56,080
好。咁第括弧四嗰度咧，就係就住第三十三誒括弧六括弧B條嗰度咧，我哋係廢除咗嗰個係分號啊，咁誒而代翻一個誒代以一個分號係句號噉樣。咁誒呢個咧其實都係一個只係一個文字上面嘅文字上面嘅改動嘅啫。咁第誒括弧。

691
02:26:56,080 --> 02:27:16,090
五第三十三括弧六括弧B條咧，我哋都係一啲文字上面嘅改動嘅啫。咁到到係第誒括弧六嗰度咧，亦都係一樣啦，就係加入翻頭先我哋所講嘅同誒預設投資策略有關嘅一啲嘅法例嘅規定啦，令到咧就係話有關嘅誒，即係啊呢一個誒站面或者中。

692
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:26,990
指核准受託人管理誒註冊計劃呢啲噉嘅罰則咧，係得以咧係用喺唔遵守預設投資策略嘅安排上面嘅嘅誒嘅受託人身上嘅噉。

693
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:33,080
有冇問題？冇咧，就繼續。

694
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:53,850
咁去到第八條咧，其實呢個誒成個部分咧都係誒就住咧就係話嗰個誒預設投資策略嘅誒成個嘅安排，包括係誒佢嗰個啊啊過渡安排啊，誒或者係嗰個誒誒就住嗰個嗯收費嘅管制啊。

695
02:27:53,850 --> 02:28:13,860
等等嘅嘢，同埋咧係呢一個係啊誒財經事務及副務局局長，佢可以誒誒去修改啊呢一個誒策略底下嘅一啲原則啊，同埋係嗰個誒嗰個誒收費限制咧，就係嗰個係嗰個文本嚟㗎啦。咁

696
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:29,670
咁誒，我或者由誒三十四d a開始讀啦。咁呢個咧係一個誒釋義嚟嘅。咁誒就住咧就係第一個就係喺誒我哋就住個有一個生效日期嘅釋義啦，就即係指本報生效嘅日期。

697
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:41,760
咁第二咧就係話，我哋就住既有賬户咧（pre-existing account）咧，呢度就係講咗指在生效日期前開立的註冊計劃的計劃成員的賬户。

698
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:55,900
係好，馮仲佳怡，我想問咧嗰個生效期咧，就你估計啦，就係誒喺法例即係三讀通過之後幾耐到可以生效？

699
02:28:57,070 --> 02:29:17,080
我哋其實咧喺誒呢度係講咗，就係話誒希望喺肯獻之後咧六個月之後咧嗰個條例就係生效嘅，係啦。咁即係話咧誒到到時咧有新嘅成員加入呢一個強積金制度咧，嗰個誒對佢哋嚟講，如果佢

700
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:17,870
唔。

701
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:25,690
誒做任何嘅投資決定嘅話咧，理論上佢就會放咗落去嗰個漁池投資策略嗰度㗎啦，嚇。

702
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:29,860
鐘女士誒，當嗰個生效日期。

703
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:40,890
誒公佈你就通過憲報刊登個日誒嘅嘅宣佈，然後就六個月之後，仲使唔使再翻嚟立法會或者之類？唔需要。唔需要嘅。唔需要嚇。

704
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:45,530
好，仲有冇咩問題？

705
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:47,520
噉。

706
02:29:47,800 --> 02:30:07,810
既有賬户，我估冇冇問題。噉我繼續讀就係特定投資指示（specific investment instructions）。就註冊計劃的計劃成員的賬户而言，指該成員向該計劃的核準受託人給予的指示，其內容為按照該成員在管限規。

707
02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:14,960
則所準許的範圍內作出的選擇，將該帳户內的累算權益投資。

708
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:23,550
有冇問題？大家。

709
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:40,280
預設投資策略成分基金，括弧D.I.S.Constituent Fund指A六十五歲後基金附表十第一條所界定者，或核心累積基金附表十第一條所界定者。

710
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:51,310
係，誒，馳總嘉義，我冇睇到呢個附表十嗰度，因為呢個mapper都冇嘅，可唔可以介紹下附表十嗰個咩係，點樣樣？

711
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:56,750
張女士，可以可以，誒。

712
02:30:57,430 --> 02:31:00,510
附表十咧，其實係喺誒。

713
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,180
係。

714
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:25,290
附表十咧，其實係就住嗰個誒預設投資策略嘅一啲規定，包括咧就係話嗰誒預設投資誒策略底下兩個成分基金誒嘅誒資料啦，同埋所謂較高風險嘅資產究竟係乜嘢嘢啦。咁另外就係話對預設投，

715
02:31:25,290 --> 02:31:45,300
投資策略嘅規定，例如就係話誒講到兩個成分基金底下誒，佢哋係點樣要用一個啊，全球投資分散嘅方式嘅誒誒作設計嘅一個成分基金啦。咁另外就係話裏邊嘅淨資產值裏邊咧有誒乜嘢嘅比例？

716
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:49,910
係需要擺喺較高風險嘅資產啊！誒誒。

717
02:31:50,190 --> 02:32:10,200
等等嘅咧，就係有一個規定嘅喺呢個附表十。咁另外附表十咧，亦都係有講到就係話，如果啊誒到到呢一個嗰個降低誒誒風險，根據年齡降低風險嘅呢一個噉樣嘅誒策略，究竟係點？喺邊一個年紀開始嚇？誒，然後咧。

718
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:30,210
咧，亦都附表十亦都有講到咧，就係話喺誒，我哋去喐嗰個兩個係基金成分基金底下誒裏邊嘅嗰個誒百分比誒錢嘅百分比，究竟係點咧？呢個亦都係有誒清楚噉樣係講到嘅喺呢一個附表十裏邊。我我主持人我諗。

719
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:38,010
我見到喺個Mark Copy嘅第廿三頁嗰度有啦，噉就或者我等間我哋都或者去到嗰陣時，我先再問嚇。

720
02:32:38,290 --> 02:32:39,030
好。

721
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:43,970
好，咁請繼續啊！

722
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:50,190
好，咁咧誒，而而家我去到第二誒分部預設投資策略。

723
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:53,430
即係而已嘅三十四d b條。

724
02:32:54,960 --> 02:33:14,970
核准受託人需按照預設投資策略將累算權益投資。誒括弧一誒註冊計劃的核準受託人括弧A，需在該計劃的規管管限規則中提供符合附表十第二部的規定的預設投資策略。B需。

725
02:33:14,970 --> 02:33:34,980
確保關乎該策略的任何投資均與本部及附表十第二部的規定相符。C括弧除第二括弧款及第三及四份分部另有規定外，需按照該策略將計劃成員的累算權益投資，但如該成員已就該等權益。

726
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:42,250
給予指定投資指示則屬例外，及D需確保該策略可供計劃成員選擇。

727
02:33:44,780 --> 02:34:02,200
括弧二，在不侷限第二十七二A條的原則下，如計劃成員在生效日期前已年滿六十歲，則有關受託人不得按照有關策略將該成員的既有帳户內的累算權益投資。

728
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:08,080
法律顧問好似有啲問題誒，要求澄清嘅。啊，法律顧問。

729
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:28,370
啊，多謝主席。嗯，咁關於呢一個議議第三十四D B括弧二條啦。咁誒，我喺法律事務部咧，之前喺誒十月二十三日咧，就係去信政府係誒問過關於呢一條條誒議議條例。

730
02:34:28,370 --> 02:34:48,380
嗰個誒內容嘅噉，我亦都得悉到嗰個政府嘅回覆啦。咁喺喺呢度，希望有一個係跟進問題，可以問翻政府嘅。誒，關於第誒以三十四D.B.誒括二條入邊嗰個誒條文入邊咧，有一。

731
02:34:48,380 --> 02:35:08,390
個誒預計日，我哋由嗰個逗號後開始睇預計劃成員在生效日期前已年滿六十歲。咁喺呢個部分咧，希望政府可以澄清，就係嗰個計劃成員嗰個誒法律上嘅定義咧，係包唔包括誒嗱，首先該

732
02:35:08,390 --> 02:35:24,280
位計劃成員係已年滿六十歲，而佢本身嘅累算權益咧，其實已經喺投資咗現有嘅預設投資安排入邊。呢一類嘅成員咧，係喺呢個條款入邊咧，係包唔包括埋喺嗰個定義入邊嘅咧？

733
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:44,510
鍾女士，係好，誒，其實咧，誒，如果呢一個啊啊喺三十四DB二個操作底下咧，一個而家嘅已經係而家喺個誒強積金制度底下嘅一個啊計劃成員啦，佢已經年滿咗六十歲。

734
02:35:44,990 --> 02:36:05,000
咁而佢嘅誒既有帳户嘅累損權益咧，誒理論上咧，誒而佢係冇作出咗任何嘅誒誒誒投資選擇嘅。不過佢咧又即係擺咗落去一啲誒而家嘅預設投資安排底下咧，喺我哋嘅法例底下咧，佢係唔會因此咧係要誒經。

735
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,570
個嗰個過渡安排嘅係啦嚇。

736
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:18,140
咁即即唔影響佢嘅，唔影響佢。如果佢喺個法例係誒生效日期之前已經年滿咗六十歲。

737
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:20,500
已經年滿咗六十歲，係啦。

738
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:25,540
好，法律顧問係清唔清楚？係清楚啊！多謝主席。

739
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:42,490
係啊，鄧家標議員。噉就即係一個政策，即係個問題，我想問問多次，即係話咧，誒，法例生效之後，佢嘅錢係擺喺而家嘅預設基金度，佢幹佢生效嗰陣時已經六十歲啦，佢就唔會轉移到DIS啊。

740
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,850
咁呢度又真係佔幾多錢啊？

741
02:36:46,720 --> 02:37:06,730
即係越縮越少咯，即係保證基金有可能又唔轉移啦。呢一批有可能轉移啦，咩出生日期唔明確嘅又我唔知有幾多噉啊，出曬期明確啦，又唔轉移，真係有幾多啊？即係你驚住D.I.S嘅參加嘅人唔會太多啦？誒係咯，即係究竟係係點咧？有冇個推推論啊？

742
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:08,530
係邊位上凳？

743
02:37:10,530 --> 02:37:27,620
We don't have exact data on ageing of members. We've done some projections and maybe we can respond to this in writing. It's a relatively small group, the over 60s, but we'll go back to our data. We don't get reporting on a per fund basis on this, but we can.

744
02:37:27,930 --> 02:37:29,420
做些Further分析。

745
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:41,150
Sorry, just in response to the question too, just so there's no confusion, this is only a transitional provision. So for a new member who starts

746
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:55,770
Who joins the scheme the day after commencement? If that person is 63 and they do not make a choice, they still go into the default investment strategy. This is only a provision that applies in a transitional sense for someone with a pre-existing account.

747
02:37:57,170 --> 02:38:13,730
係，阿鄧家彪，我我想再問得明確啦。咁而家個就業率都OK啦，希望冇冇失業率即係上升嘅問題。咁即係話，如果一個六十一歲工友，佢有份新工喺新下期之後，佢唔做投資選擇，噉佢會係咪跌翻落DAS？

748
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:15,150
okay。

749
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:16,990
好清楚。

750
02:38:18,150 --> 02:38:21,630
好，如果冇其他問題，我哋誒請阿鍾女士繼續。

751
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:29,300
誒，噉我就跳去三十四DC嗰度啦。

752
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,290
管制就有關。

753
02:38:32,870 --> 02:38:36,330
預設投資策略。你靠近啲個麥，我哋聽唔到。

754
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:43,220
誒三十四DC管制就關乎預設投資策略的服務作出的付款。

755
02:38:43,950 --> 02:39:03,960
括弧一除第三括弧三款另有規定外，註冊計劃的核準受託人需確保不得就第括弧二款所指明的服務，誒A向該計劃的預設投資策略成分基金收取或施加付款，或B向投資。

756
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:08,170
於該基金的計劃成員收取或私加付款。

757
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:10,990
我冇喺呢度停一停先。

758
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:12,930
有冇問題？

759
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:35,890
請繼續括弧二為施行第括弧一款而指明的服務，是以下人士就有關預設投資策略成分基金所提供的服務：A有關該有關核准受託人；B指明服務提供者；或C在註冊計

760
02:39:35,890 --> 02:39:41,390
計劃的管限規則中指明為保鑣人或推銷商的人。

761
02:39:46,060 --> 02:40:06,070
有冇問題？啊，鄧家彪議員啊，因為呢度應該就係個收費管控最核心嘅部分，即係咩包咩唔包，係準受託人名啦。即係現時個十十五個活躍嘅服務提供者喺現有嘅嘅法例，即係現有強積金嘅法例又好，或者其他相關可能同即係證券。

762
02:40:06,070 --> 02:40:07,940
啊！保險金融有關條例。

763
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:28,510
指明服務提供者有冇現有已經有嘅法律適宜係包含啲乜嘢嘅？即係誒誒部分認可嘅嘅人士有啲有啲，譬如話承保人啊，有啲係基金經理啊。我我即係我我據我所知啊，有啲係中介人啊，有啲係行政嗰方面。咁呢個服。

764
02:40:28,510 --> 02:40:44,320
無提供者即係會包含啲乜嘢嘅咧？現有法例有冇一個即係引申咁？當然，司嗰個保賬人同埋推薦商咁都頗明確啦。咁所以睇下可唔可能有個噉嘅演譯，究竟係即係咩嚟咧？

765
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:47,010
係邊位相睇？

766
02:40:55,970 --> 02:41:11,930
誒張女士，喺邊位上台？誒喺我哋個誒法例裏邊咧，其實咧啊，就住誒指明服務提供者咧，如果大家去揭翻去嗰個法例文本裏邊咧，後邊係應該係括弧。

好，即係後邊有個説明嘅，有啊，即係喺C二三一六嗰度，一陣間我哋會傾到嘅。哦，哦，嗯，O K。

772
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:04,080
好，有冇其他問題？

773
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:09,630
如果冇咧，請繼續。

774
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:29,920
好誒，括弧三第一款不適誒，第括弧一款不適用於就有關服務作出的符合以下説明嘅付款：A按預設投資策略成分基金的淨資產值的百分比計算的；B符合以下兩項羅馬數字一，是就保管人所提供的服務。

775
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:47,180
擴户與持有或維持該基金的投資或進行該基金的投資的交易相關者，三擴户而收取或私加的及誒羅馬數字已關上，並非按該基金的淨資產值的百分比計算的。

776
02:42:47,750 --> 02:43:02,980
括弧C就關乎設立該基金或將該基金清盤的服務而收取或施加的，或括弧D就有關成員取得無需根據本條例提供的文件的文本而向該成員收取的。

777
02:43:06,170 --> 02:43:08,460
好，括弧第三條有冇問題？

778
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:29,770
誒主席係誒鄧局長，我我諗呢個就係頭先個清單個問題，有幾多係即係非管控嘅，即係實質開支嘅嗰個清單。噉我我我想第一搞清楚就係誒第三條同我所要求嘅清單，可唔可能喺補交，即係可能下一次匯報交文件裡面有個。

779
02:43:29,770 --> 02:43:49,780
即係誒有個應用嗰個誒誒誒顯示咧，即係譬如話誒，你哋嗰個清單可能有啲個開支就係符合緊講緊三A或者係三B一噉樣，可唔可能有個更清楚嘅顯示咧？第一，第二、第三點嗰個即係誒非管控嘅。

780
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:54,670
嘅開支咧，係一個盡列嘅，定係一啲原則性嘅咧？

781
02:43:57,060 --> 02:44:17,070
鍾女士，係誒嗱，其實喺誒第三嗰度咧，我哋都已經誒靠埋啲個麥，冇意思嚇誒。我哋喺第誒括弧三嗰款嗰度咧，其實都講得好清楚，就係話誒第一款唔適用嘅服務究竟係一啲乜嘢噉，即係話咧，其實喺如果我哋將誒第

782
02:44:17,070 --> 02:44:37,080
括活三款A款嗰個零點七五呢一個，同上面嗰個一齊睇咧，基本上就係話所有嘅費用咧係唔可以係係因為呢一個噉樣嘅呢啲噉嘅服務咧係唔可以超過零點七五呢一個嘅，必須係要係一個啊百分比啦噉。

783
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:55,510
咁然後如果我哋再睇埋後邊誒誒附表十一嘅話咧，嗰個百分比係乜嘢咧？嚇點樣計法咧？噉樣噉係兩個一齊噉樣操作嘅嚇。咁或者我請請阿馬生再誒誒詳細介紹一下兩件事究竟點樣操作嘅嚇。阿馬成瑞先生。

784
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:08,570
Chairman, I hear the concerns Mr Tang expresses, wanting a itemised list. I'm just not quite sure what can be produced in that sense.

785
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:18,610
Because the objective here is to control some known fee elements. There are things that are not fees, which are outside this.

786
02:45:18,990 --> 02:45:25,720
what that might include, we've tried to summarise in the response we've already provided.

787
02:45:26,630 --> 02:45:46,640
If we do this textually, if we go to the actual documents, the scheme documents, to try to segregate those which are the fees from other things, we can give you an awful lot of text. We can give you some extracts, but it's not terribly helpful because fundamentally this goes back to an old trust concept that trustees were entitled to be.

788
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:58,340
compensated for the costs of actually running a trust. Modern trusts trustees can also charge fees, so it's the fee element, which is the profit part of it, covering their cost plus profit, that is.

789
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:18,630
The bit we're trying to capture here, I'll give some more thought to it to see if I can satisfy your concern about having a list. But a checklist is technically not possible because short of giving you and it's textually very long. Extracting from all the deeds the description of other things that can be extracted from the corpus of the fund is quite hard.

790
02:46:18,630 --> 02:46:29,180
Let me think about it further. I understand your concern. We want to have an understanding of what's in and what's out. But the best we can categorise it is in the way we have. But let me think about if we can do that better for you.

791
02:46:30,810 --> 02:46:45,430
啊，鄧家必源，啊啊，主席，即係我我唔係懂得基金嘅運作嘅，但係即係既然呢個法例嘅精神就係要即係有個上限嘅，即係基金嘅管理費開支。

792
02:46:45,710 --> 02:46:56,080
我哋就即係當然係擔心啦，從最市民嘅角度，即係嗰啲錢嘅開支嘅名目咧就挪移啦，嚇轉變啦，原本咧可能係符合。

793
02:46:56,360 --> 02:47:16,370
第二條嘅就變為第三條啊！你話要啊唔用百分比去計嘅開支咧，噉我部全部變曬一個實數一筆過咯，得唔得咧？我唔知得唔得嘅。噉我亦都明白，可能呢個世即係即係好複雜啦，所以可能激即係咁講，未必容易即係羅列曬出嚟。但

794
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:34,670
譬如我舉一個例子，即係我唔，我就咁即刻睇條例咋嚇。睇第二條二B指明服務提供者，噉啊去翻藍紙草案嘅C二三一六，咁個指明服務提供者係包括咗咧第二點，該計劃嘅計劃資產的保管人。

795
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:54,960
好啦，即係話咧，保管人嘅提供服務咧係應該咧係管佢嘅，啊，簡單嘅佢開始管佢。但係去到第三點，B一符合呢兩個條件咧就可以不受管嘅就係保管人所提供嘅服務而收取或私加嘅括弧，我唔講啦嚇。噉我就好混淆啦，起碼我。

796
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:59,880
紅色基金啦，可能有實質分別，但係嚇都係保管人喎，咁即係管理唔管咧？

797
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:03,490
啊，邊位想介紹？

798
02:48:05,750 --> 02:48:25,760
Let me try to, chairman. The custodian thing is an example of this exactly as you put it. We're trying to capture the management fees, so the fees that those who do the management. There was a question of whether custodians are in or out. As it turns out, there are two types of custodian fees. There's a fee they perform for.

799
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:34,690
get for doing their service, and that is the intention is that that's captured, but that they also custodians also

800
02:48:35,890 --> 02:48:55,900
also get compensated for performing particular acts in the role as custodian, and that's transaction specific. So if a fund goes and buys certain shares in certain markets, and there's a corporate action like a dividend payment or something, then the custodian, as being the holder of the assets, charges a fee in relation to that. That's not their management function, but that flows from the fact that a

801
02:48:55,900 --> 02:49:11,710
特定交易已經發生，和所以我們試圖區分那些。所以，在三B，所以這在effect是什麼是內在費限。有部分的保管費是內在費限。

802
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:32,000
So and they are those for the service of a custodian connection with doing those things. Sorry, these are the ones that are out that are customarily not calculated percentage of the net asset values of the fund. So there's there's two parts to to that exception. They have to be services for those types of things and the cust.

803
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:38,960
customarily not calculated as a percentage of the net asset value, and that's for two reasons. A, they're not in the sort of management

804
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:41,290
categorisation。

805
02:49:41,570 --> 02:50:01,580
但also， we get calculation impossibilities if we start including fixed costs. So a transaction one is not AUN based. It's not related to the net asset value of the fund. So it can't be added into the .75. So we try to distinguish those. And there's also this limitation about it's not customarily done. So we don't want the situation

806
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:11,070
Where trustees and custodians get together and agree, well, we're going to do this on a non NAV basis, so it's outside the fee cap. We say you can't do that because that's

807
02:50:11,350 --> 02:50:21,470
if it's if it's a if it's if it's of its nature something that is customarily done in that way, so we're trying to limit the extent to which custodian fees are outside of the fee cap.

808
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:26,570
There are just different types of custodial functions that that are impacted by that.

809
02:50:27,850 --> 02:50:44,400
誒，啊，主席，即係即係即係，我我聽落嚟就明啦，即係話咧，誒係有誒，因為唔同嘅功能，咁可能咧管嘅收費就係呢一個部分功能，唔管嘅收費係另外嗰部分嘅功能。

810
02:50:44,680 --> 02:51:03,440
噉我先講先，三C D我絕對理解嘅係嗰啲一筆過嘅開支設置或者係清盤所需要嘅開支。當然設置裡面究竟有冇啲即係明明係恆常嘅即係開支又化為一筆過？呢個我我覺得都要再再留意啦。

811
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:20,830
D就係話，如果個成員本身咧法例冇豁免嘅權利，可能佢額外要攞一啲資料嘅一啲行程費，我當呢啲我都接受。但係B咧，似乎就真係對於一個想監察、想知多啲強積金制度嘅人，舉個例，鄧家彪立法會議員，我都唔明。

812
02:51:21,110 --> 02:51:26,420
咩保管人喺咩情況真係要管，咩情況真係唔管？我係絕對唔明嘅。我睇文件。

813
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:43,610
咁即係我唔知呢個係咪缺口啦嚇，咁所以阿阿主席喺呢度有冇辦法再澄清多啲，甚至係咪係咯？法律顧問希望你又講下觀點，會唔會法即係條文上面已經有啲古怪咧嚇？

814
02:51:44,250 --> 02:51:45,590
法律顧問。

815
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:49,740
係誒，多謝主席。

816
02:51:50,680 --> 02:52:10,690
噉就誒，關於嗰個條文上面嗰個細則，點樣斷定邊一啲誒服務係包括咗喺嗰個誒所謂嘅誒誒管制嗰個預設投資策略服務作出個付款個上限啦，同埋邊啲係唔誒並不適。

817
02:52:10,690 --> 02:52:30,700
用於邊一啲服務係並不適用於呢個議議嘅條例入邊咧？咁誒，其實誒，我諗條文上嚟講，當然呢方面嗰個關於嗰個草議上，可能我哋係誒需要誒法律草議部嗰邊嘅同事，可能要畀啲意見。

818
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:50,710
就關於草案上方面啦，咁但係關於嗰個誒理念上能能夠達至嗰個目的咧，就誒法律事務部嘅意見就似乎睇翻中立翻本身呢一個二條文啦，以及係我哋睇翻嗰個男子特別。

819
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:52,400
係C二三一六。

820
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:59,750
誒入邊嗰個指明服務提供者底下嗰個誒。

821
02:53:00,230 --> 02:53:02,580
一啲嘅特定嗰個。

822
02:53:03,050 --> 02:53:05,740
誒，佢嗰個誒。

823
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:15,160
條文上寫出嚟，佢定斷邊啲人士喺關於提供服務喺個計劃入邊提供服務嘅人士。

824
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:35,450
嗰個條文上細則咧，似乎嗰誒，我理解到議員嗰個疑問。咁但係睇翻個條文細則，似乎咧係誒個清晰度咧係喺度嘅。咁誒，當然草擬上邊有啲乜嘢誒可以作出改進咧，或者呢方面可以要可能需要嗰個誒法律。

825
02:53:35,450 --> 02:53:41,620
草業部嗰邊嘅同事嘅誒，都想可能要睇睇。

826
02:53:41,900 --> 02:54:01,910
嚇噉，但係嗰個清晰性嚟講咧，誒喺法律事務部嗰個立場嚟睇咧，誒我哋係睇到其實誒誒關於釐定邊一啲服務係需要接受嗰個上限、嗰個管制，而邊啲咧係現時嚟講喺嗰個誒。

827
02:54:01,910 --> 02:54:09,620
條文入邊咧唔受管嘅咧，咁喺呢方面嗰個斷定咧，我哋法律事務部嘅意見係認為咧，嗰個清晰度咧可以接受嘅。

828
02:54:10,630 --> 02:54:13,900
誒政府嘅政府律師啊，黎生有冇咩補充？

829
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:16,240
喺個草耳嘅方面。

830
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:36,570
多謝主席。噉啊，據我理解，其實依家嗰個啊議員嘅問題，基本上就係誒關於嗰個條例方面咧，就係三嘅B嘅誒細羅馬一同二喺實際嗰個應用方面係點樣去定奪嘅。咁呢方面嚟講，其實主要即係睇翻嗰個實際情況咧，同埋睇翻嗰個誒強積金管理委員會佢係點樣實施嗰個。

831
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:41,900
條文嘅時候咧，去誒就呢啲噉嘅條文作出一個誒適當嘅解釋嘅啊，都係主席。

832
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:43,620
啊，鄧家彪員。

833
02:54:43,900 --> 02:54:45,340
嗱，誒。

834
02:54:45,790 --> 02:55:05,800
譬如佢用翻藍紙話A二，該計劃嘅計劃資產的保管人，噉就應該跌咗落去二B，就服務提供者受管。咁呢一個大嘅呢個，咁但係咧，如果佢作出某一類嘅工作，我唔敢講係服務啦，係工作。

835
02:55:05,800 --> 02:55:25,810
係去咗三B一同埋二咧，佢就可以豁免嘅。即係我哋幾關關心第一呢一類工作係幾常常會發生，定係一個一不過一次性嘅？如果你話佢每週每月佢都會發生嘅，咁似乎又有違咗管理費或者日。

836
02:55:25,810 --> 02:55:45,820
常管理費嘅呢個概念咧，第一，第二就係點樣預防佢挪移，即係明明可能係應該受管制嘅慣常嘅服務提供，就變為咗咧跌咗落去三B一同二啊。你話按百分比收就太明顯，要管啦。我用定價。

837
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:50,050
啊！去收咯，即係呢呢啲就係我個兩個嘅疑問咯，係啊。

838
02:55:50,670 --> 02:55:56,490
我諗誒，議員可能就擔心咧，即係而家雖然話你個管理費零點七五。

839
02:55:56,770 --> 02:56:16,780
但會唔會嗰個誒法律嘅條文寫出嚟嗰啲嘢咧，係可能會日後會導致到啊話零點七五係唔包括在內嘅，佢可以另加嘅嘅費用，誒咁因而咧，即係嗰個所謂零點七五咧，即係啊即係虛有其名。

840
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:24,110
可能第日可能係誒係遠遠唔止，因為佢可以用其他名目收費，係咪咁意思咧？係啊。

841
02:56:24,390 --> 02:56:42,610
咁呢方面點樣可以令到誒議員可以安心咧？誒，主席，同埋佢嘅實質性質即係乜嘢？三B一二實質佢係一種恆常會經常出現嘅一種工作引致收費，定係唔係嘅？係一一次性嘅，我都要搞清楚。

842
02:56:43,070 --> 02:56:45,640
咁好唔好？你哋再揾個書面。

843
02:56:45,920 --> 02:57:05,930
嗱，寫清楚佢，即係究竟呢啲係講緊啲乜嘢嘅，嚇會唔會導致到第日又即係好似畀咗啲藉口嚇，去再增加一啲嘅誒行政嘅管理嘅費用係啊？善眾嘉議員，你完咗先啦，我我跟住問。係。你你你你。啊冇冇冇冇！我叫佢畀。

844
02:57:05,930 --> 02:57:08,350
一個書面嘅誒資料，我哋嚇。

845
02:57:08,760 --> 02:57:25,900
去到呢一個咁技術嘅問題上面咧，我都開始有啲唔明嘅啦。嗱，因為咧，其實嗰啲預設基金咧係，我我相信係一個基金嚟嘅啫。但係咧，就因為，如果我冇理解錯啦，你啲powerpoint介紹咧就隨年齡降低投資風險。

846
02:57:26,180 --> 02:57:42,350
噉啊，除年齡降低投資風險咧，就其實就係誒有個叫核心累積基金，有個叫做六十五歲嘅基金噉樣。噉係咪即係有兩個基金？佢個佢持嗰即係點啊？佢擁有嘅權益就係呢兩個基金嘅比例。

847
02:57:42,630 --> 02:57:43,680
係咪噉嘅意思？

848
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:51,310
噉係咪？因為你個比例咧係誒，根據你個誒附表十嘅第三嗰度咧，你係誒。

849
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:58,680
我唔同嘅類，我我唔同嘅年紀咧，就有轉移嘅噉嘅樣。

850
02:57:59,140 --> 02:58:17,090
噉就當然啦，佢每年都有供款嘅，咁可能你因應個供款裏邊咧，如果佢年紀大嘅咧，噉就一路咁供落去嗰個誒六十五歲後嗰個基金嗰度啦，個比例噉樣樣都得。咁但係可能唔係咁突突冚㗎嘛，咁嗰啲可能佢會唔會需要即係誒誒喺？

851
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:23,480
第二輪個新基金嗰度沽緊啲，然之後喺攞翻啲，咁呢啲費用係咪包喺喺度嘅嚇？

852
02:58:23,990 --> 02:58:25,390
明樣問題嗎？

853
02:58:26,690 --> 02:58:27,950
係邊位上答？

854
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:30,170
啊！啊，馬上。

855
02:58:30,790 --> 02:58:33,070
Chairman, I'll I'll try.

856
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:53,520
yes you understand the concept perfectly the funds don't change the asset allocation within the funds is static so the core accumulation stays at sixty forty the risk reduction is achieved by moving person out of that fund and putting more of their money in the other fund and that's done once a year only it's not done every month that's only supposed to be done once a year

857
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:54,490
啊。

858
02:58:56,070 --> 02:59:16,080
In terms of fees associated with that, no, the fees are not allowed on a transfer between funds in a scheme, unless it relates to an actual cost incurred in buying or selling assets. That's unlike no no funds currently charge that. It's called an anti-dilution levy, as as you'd be aware.

859
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:36,090
That's not actually a part of the MPF system at the moment, but it is. It is possible. That would not be within the fee cap because that's not a fee. That goes back into the fund. So in short, in effect, there'll be no fee for that to happen. And once every year, there'd be that reallocation. And any new money coming in in the following year would be allocated between those two.

860
02:59:36,090 --> 02:59:38,910
兩個基金， in the proportion set out in that table.

861
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:44,250
好，啊法律顧問都有嘢想補充下。

862
02:59:44,580 --> 03:00:04,590
係誒，多謝主席。就住頭先議員嘅發問啦，同埋嗰個政府回覆啦。咁關於而以誒第三十四D C括三底下嗰個條款咧，咁誒或者可能其實都希望政府係作出誒有關補充，特別係關於。

863
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:24,600
誒三庫B底下誒羅馬數字一底下咧，其實嗰個相對上羅馬數字一同二相對上嚟講，羅馬數字一嗰個誒喺嗰個定義上邊咧係比較冇咁含糊嘅，因為嗰度係其實特別誒可以留意翻就係是就保管人所提供的服務。

864
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:41,980
括弧與持有或維持該基金嘅投資或進行該基金嘅投資嘅交易相關者，生括而收取或私加的，咁變相嚟講，其實括弧入邊嗰個誒定義咧，其實對於個保管人所提供乜嘢服務係？

865
03:00:42,360 --> 03:01:02,370
誒嗰啲服務係唔適用於嗰個所謂嗰個收費上限，嗰個誒理論上相對嚟講清晰。咁或者政府可以係就誒關於羅馬數字二入邊嗰個所謂嘅慣常，並非按該基金嘅淨資產值百分比計算嗰個項目咧。誒，我相信就係。

866
03:01:02,370 --> 03:01:22,380
係誒或者議員嗰個問題所在，亦都係唔清晰所在。咁有關羅馬數字二啲方面嗰度，或者政府可以係希望就住呢一個範圍係關上，並非按該基金嘅資產總淨資產值嘅百分比計算呢一個項目咧，係作出有關嘅一啲誒。

867
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:23,110
書面呈請。

868
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:24,710
好，冇嘢。

869
03:01:24,990 --> 03:01:25,640
好。

870
03:01:25,950 --> 03:01:45,960
啊！特嘉，表議員誒，即係亦都係舉實例啦。即係譬如話，如果誒誒抽任何一隻即係股債混合基金，究竟三B一二即係實質佔個開支係百分之幾？唔知會唔會揾到一啲虛，即係一啲例子。當然唔使開名啦，去畀我哋一個好實。

871
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:46,700
嘅。

872
03:01:47,050 --> 03:01:48,730

阿鄧家彪議員，呢度係講到嗰個基礎投資項目基金嗰度，你覺得點？係，嗯，我真係唔好意思，可唔可以多啲講解？因為呢個即係實質係啲乜嘢嚟嘅？即係某一類型嘅基金先至會出現基礎投資項目基金啊？誒，係一個設置嘅費用。

901
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:43,330
用啊，定係行上又會出現，因為似乎喺個條例裏面咧，呢一個嘅基金費用亦都係豁免於外不受管控嘅。我我嘅理解係，我想搞清楚究竟係咩？係可唔可以再解釋下？

902
03:07:43,750 --> 03:08:03,760
馬成先生，Thank you, Chairman. This is the complex part. The structuring of MPF schemes is such that actually no investment activity happens at the constituent fund level. So most of these fees, there's nothing at the constituent fund level. So there's a trustee fee, but none of the actual investment costs are incurred at the

903
03:08:03,760 --> 03:08:23,770
CF level，所以，the problem we had is if like any other country that's done this， we limit it to the pension fund，the CF，we will miss most of the fees。所以，what these definitions try to do is to capture the same types of fees，the trustee，investment manager，custodian，promoter and sponsor，if they occur at any underlying

904
03:08:23,770 --> 03:08:43,780
investment fund. So the objective is to capture exactly those, not to exempt them, but to capture them. The maths is quite complex. The A times B is effectively you have to apportion them. But what we're trying to capture is any similar fees that we're talking about at the CF level, which occur at the underlying fund level. And the types of funds we're talking about are those in the

905
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:45,930
定義 of underlining investment fund.

906
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:52,540
most of the investment activity occurs in things called APFs in paragraph A there approved pooled investment funds.

907
03:08:53,110 --> 03:09:13,120
In practice, all constituent funds, all all of these DIS funds are likely to invest through APF. So we definitely want to capture any trustee type fee, any sponsor type fee, any investment manager type fee that happens there, and also the second one, index funds. It's likely they'll use funds like they may use tracker fund to get Hong Kong equity exposure. So

908
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:26,430
If there's an investment manager cost at that index fund level, that also gets included in the calculation, and similarly sees any other types of collective investment schemes are allowed to invest in. So the objective is, as

909
03:09:26,710 --> 03:09:34,510
was suggested that we deliberately are capturing those types of funds at underlying fund levels.

910
03:09:35,140 --> 03:09:36,570
啊，馮總監員。

911
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:39,680
呢度都係多謝解釋啊！

912
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:43,530
呢個其實都係有一個問題喎，嗰個翻嗱可能。

913
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:48,240
如果睇英文咧，underlying investment分咧就比較容易理解啲。

914
03:09:48,870 --> 03:09:49,900
即係。

915
03:09:50,450 --> 03:09:55,240
但係如果你用中文咧，就基礎投資項目基金咧。

916
03:09:55,900 --> 03:09:58,030
就有啲誤導性喺度嘅。

917
03:09:58,950 --> 03:10:00,000
誒。

918
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:08,310
因為如果你英文嗰個即係字字面嘅嘅嘅嘅意見意思咧，就係即係。

919
03:10:09,110 --> 03:10:18,480
其實你個中文有解釋嘅成分基金啊嘛，即係你你呢個你呢個投資策略嗰個D誒D4 investment scheme裏邊嘅一個。

920
03:10:19,580 --> 03:10:26,560
下面組成嘅投資成分嘅基金噉樣樣係嘛？即係呢啲係會唔會係？

921
03:10:27,090 --> 03:10:40,130
我相信鄧家，唔知係咪鄧家彪都係有個呢個噉嘅，即係見到基礎投資噉樣樣就好似無啦啦整咗個新嘢出嚟。但係其實呢個係指呢一個default investment default。

922
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,260
預設。

923
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:46,300
投資嘅組成基金嘅。

924
03:10:47,050 --> 03:10:53,410
同佢有咩關係嘅？我我調翻轉問翻，即係個D.I.S.Construction分同呢一個Underlying Investment分有冇關係嘅？

925
03:10:54,570 --> 03:10:57,610
係，邊位先答？阿馬成信先生。

926
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:18,050
To explain the structure, the term DIS is not a fund. That's just a concept. So it's a strategy about how you invest in CFs. All schemes are split into some pots, and we call them in the law constituent funds. So the two CF and the DIS are just some different pots within the scheme. So

927
03:11:18,050 --> 03:11:38,060
所有 money 會 go into the CFs， they actually are invested not through the CF， but the CF will then buy into other funds， typically APFs or index funds。所以 it's the costs that are incurred at that lower level， which is where most of the costs will actually be incurred。所以 we want to uplift those， as if they're an

928
03:11:38,060 --> 03:11:58,070
都 have to be added to the cost at the CF level. So we'll be adding the cost. This is the A plus B. The cost incurred at the CF level plus the cost incurred at the underlying fund level, and apportioning those because they'll be in different percentages. So that's the structure. Money goes into the CF and is used to buy units in.

929
03:11:58,070 --> 03:12:17,300
underlying A-PEFs or index funds， and the actual investment happens below that. If they invest in further funds， they're also caught， because they have that's indirect investment. The definition captures those as well. So the intention is that we'll uplift any underlying investment funds to be added to the actual costs at the constituent fund level.

930
03:12:18,980 --> 03:12:20,630
誒，等下畀。

931
03:12:20,910 --> 03:12:31,410
即係當然，我自己有責任惡補一下佢呢啲係乜嘢嚟嘅。但係我想問清楚咧，即係我我我我而家再睇清楚條文就係話四B。

932
03:12:31,690 --> 03:12:51,700
裡面都寫得好清楚，就係話咧，誒嗰個收費管控零點七五咧，係會管埋呢一個咧，誒中文叫做基礎投資項目基金所引申嘅開始收費，係咪啊？應該係包埋㗎嘛。O.K.，所以喺個原則嘅角度咧，即係基金局做好監管咧，就即係會處。

933
03:12:51,700 --> 03:13:11,710
嚟到頭先講嗰種可能出現嘅嘅變化，噉我我我想誒另外個問一個問題就係話咧誒對於整個強積金即係闊少少嘅，對於整個強積金嗰個收費高咧，有啲專業人士同我講過咧誒誒強積金嘅運作咧又有好多個部分嘅，其中一個部分咧。

934
03:13:11,710 --> 03:13:31,720
即係譬如投資經理啊、受託人啊，其中一個部分咧叫sponsor，我唔知中文名叫咩名啦嚇，就係話咧，其實通常往往就係受託人嘅母公司裡面咧，誒當開啊基金嗰陣時咧，係收取唔少嘅錢嘅。咁呢啲誒佢哋嘅歸歸咎就係一個利益嘅關係啊，因為母公司。

935
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:50,200
公司叫子公司開一隻產品噉，又自己要有啲利潤。我想問誒，即係呢一啲嘅講法，譬如話誒sponsor嗰個角色同呢一個新設嘅DIS有冇咩關係咧？誒，嗰個收費管控會唔會處理到呢一啲有專業人士嘅質疑咧？

936
03:13:50,810 --> 03:13:52,530
啊，馬成尚先生。

937
03:13:53,730 --> 03:14:13,740
Thank you, Chairman. The role of the sponsor is a bit of a question. They're not defined in the law previously, but we know they exist. And yes, we know the sponsor gets a fee. Typically, they are looked at as the business owner. So, as you rightly put it, in some structures, that's the holding company of the trustee. They set the thing up.

938
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:19,240
And they do the distribution, so notionally their fee relates to distribution.

939
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:39,530
We did. We tried to define these in an earlier version to define them, but it doesn't matter what they do, as long as the person who is the sponsor, their fee is captured in the zero seven five. It doesn't matter in a sense what they do. They probably do different things, but in reality, their fee is does relate to distribution typically because.

940
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:42,230
within a large bank or insurance company, it's the

941
03:14:42,510 --> 03:15:02,520
umbrella organisation which does most of the distribution work, but we went away from trying to attach the fee control to a function, because these sponsors and promoters might have different types of function. So the way that the section now works in that definition of specified service provider, it's

942
03:15:02,520 --> 03:15:04,100
just a person who.

943
03:15:04,500 --> 03:15:05,650
嗯。

944
03:15:07,010 --> 03:15:08,070
to see.

945
03:15:09,120 --> 03:15:29,130
Sorry, wrong subsection. So we capture them just by by their name. So as long as they're named in the documents, and all of the schemes have some of these people, they will be caught by the fee provision. So that's 34 DC 2C. We capture a person named as the sponsor or promoter in the governing rules. So in the end, it doesn't matter what they.

946
03:15:29,130 --> 03:15:33,890
或如何他們split their role with the trustee，因為兩者嘅費用都係會被捕捉。

947
03:15:35,510 --> 03:15:53,260
啊，鄧家彪，O K，即係所以嗰個誒疑慮咧，就應該處理咗，因為第一喺個計劃嗰個嗰個構想都會係處理呢個問題。第二，頭先講無論係誒三十四D C二B定係二C，我見到保賬人啦，英文叫sponsor，就係處理緊呢個問題係咪啊？

948
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:54,470
O.K.

949
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:57,990
好，如果冇嘢咧，我哋繼續落去。

950
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:07,250

有冇問題？

955
03:16:49,150 --> 03:16:50,870

啊，鐘女士，可唔可以解釋一下呢個？可以可以。誒，呢個咧，其實就係話我哋喺嗰個誒預設投資策略底下咧，就誒有誒都有一啲部分咧係誒，我哋認為係誒建議咧，係財經事務及副務局局長咧，可以直住憲報公告咧，係誒。

03:19:54,200 --> 03:19:58,470
誒，亦都係誒，局長亦都可以係作出修改嘅，嚇。

969
03:20:01,070 --> 03:20:21,080
即係話，我哋呢個法例咧就授權咗畀財經事務及副務局局長，佢嘅權力可以作出修改。噉啊，修改嘅時候咧就係啊，憲報刊登嘅公告就得啦。即係唔需要嚟翻立法會做任何嘅咩啊？呢啲要再解釋。啊！

970
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:33,780
啊，鐘女士，誒呢個係誒我哋平時所謂用誒呢一個誒negative vetting嘅方式去處理嘅啊，主席，即係要negative vetting，即係翻返嚟立法會嘅啦，啊，即係我哋可以提出唔同嘅意見。

971
03:20:34,060 --> 03:20:37,470
所以我就呢樣嘢想問清楚啲。如果唔係咧，

972
03:20:37,810 --> 03:20:42,600
財經事務局咧個局長咧，可能就有咩事，佢要承擔曬所有風險㗎啦。

973
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:46,180
係啊，鄧家彪員。

974
03:20:46,460 --> 03:21:02,120
都係主席誒，投資嘅嘢我我就真係唔識啦嚇。當然頭先講過嗰個即係誒市民嘅訴求，就係誒盡量係合理回報，即係跑及通脹。噉我唔知點樣可以透過三十四D。

975
03:21:02,400 --> 03:21:22,410
三十四D D一A裏面嗰一啲，即係修訂附表作出調節。即係我，我唔知係咪。如果係有個噉嘅訴求，你哋接納嘅話咧，我唔知係咪喺呢一度裏面做改動。但係咧，另一個咧相對清晰嘅咧就係三十四D D一B，就係嗰個誒。

976
03:21:22,410 --> 03:21:30,290
附表十一管控零點七五percent嘅收費，我係當然好希望咧，呢個收費越嚟越低啦，或者。

977
03:21:30,950 --> 03:21:50,960
再可能係基本啲嘅，就係都起碼指明有一個時間，喂點都要再睇睇嗰個嘅誒，即係嗰個誒有冇空間啦，或者會唔會出現一種社會誒唔係咁滿意嘅情狀況，就係話係啊，佢哋的確咧個個管理費全部係零點七五。

978
03:21:51,030 --> 03:22:11,040
齊輯輯，但係咧，佢有好多咧非管控嘅項目嘅百分比扯得好高，嗰度有零點七五，我亂噏下，即係夾埋係一個大家不能接受嘅數。咁即係即係點樣嘅情況之下，局長先至會係出咗第一輪零點七五，然後會。

979
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:26,030
再做調整，當然呢個調整係向下啦。大家希望即係即係我哋關心係有冇個時期嘅保證，或者係一種誒狀況嘅嘅情況出現咗，就會做呢個調整。我哋即係希望再清晰啲。

980
03:22:27,670 --> 03:22:30,310
係有咩解釋？想唔想而家講？

981
03:22:30,750 --> 03:22:35,760
或者主席，我哋喺誒書面回覆嗰度再誒交代呢一個得唔得？

982
03:22:36,250 --> 03:22:56,260
好，不如咧，我哋就傾到呢度啦。嗯，就因為大家剛才都講咗一係列嘅問題，都誒有啲嘢希望佢用一個書面嘅方式誒再講清楚、講透啲嚇，因為呢個部分咧都幾重要下嘅嚇。噉啊，然後咧，係阿錢仲介。

983
03:22:56,260 --> 03:22:58,110
主席，我都係誒。

984
03:22:58,450 --> 03:23:07,470
誒同意你嘅説法書面，但係即係都都，因為你你頭先講嗰啲咧，咩underlying分嗰啲咧，你可唔可以即係誒？

985
03:23:07,930 --> 03:23:27,940
因為你但最初嗰個presentation嗰度咧係個即係喺一個conceptual嘅解釋嚟嘅。今次咧喺啲即係啊，I think you need to。I I hope you can explain in more detail how you know different funds controlling their underlying funds。I think give us a a new presentation。

986
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:33,270
with sufficient explanations.

987
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:56,180
大家有冇咩嘢認為希望喺個書面回應嘅時候再強調一下嘅，或者再精析啲嘅？有冇呢啲問題？啊，唔好意思，真係要好厭煩。我咁講多次，就係對於嗰個誒誒不規管嘅開支，究竟就現實去睇，或者經驗去睇？

988
03:23:56,180 --> 03:24:16,190
究竟係有啲乜嘢嘅項目？有邊啲係一次性嘅？有邊啲係持續性嘅？咁究竟會唔會引申到而家個法例裏面，即係嗰個第三條裏面所所出現嘅已經即係誒嘅條文咧，係咪可以引申落去咧？呢個我好想。

989
03:24:16,190 --> 03:24:30,720
即係掌握多啲，甚至一個誒一個實質嘅推算啦。咁即係佔幾多百分比咧？喺呢一個項目啊，如果以某一隻現成嘅基金做例子，唔開名。呢個第一個，第二個就係嗰個誒附表十一。

990
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:51,030
即係透過憲報公告，究竟日後個調整嘅方式？誒，當然我估你哋唔希望寫寫落條文嘅，但係政策上嘅討論會係點樣咧？你哋會點樣處理？誒，附表十一啊，可以包埋附表十，即係日後如何作一個調整個決定嘅機制係點，標準係。

991
03:24:51,030 --> 03:25:11,040
係點樣咧？誒，我諗起碼呢兩樣好清晰。第三就係誒，都係政策上問嘅啫，即係你哋會唔會再考慮喺表現上面？你哋會有一啲誒加強嗰個罰則，令到佢哋即係嗰十幾個受託嗰個誒核心基金D.I.S嗰個表現咧？

992
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:14,400
係合符大家期望，即係話唔好跑輸通脹。

993
03:25:15,430 --> 03:25:30,260
好清楚啊嘛。好，誒，法律顧問有冇咩你想補充下？多謝主席。好，如果冇咧，我哋今日會議到呢度結束。我哋下次會議咧就係誒一月二十六號星期二十點九。多謝大家出席。
