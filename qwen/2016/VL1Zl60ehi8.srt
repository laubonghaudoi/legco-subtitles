1
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,610
你坐等緊。

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,830
咁咧。

3
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,420
Okay, Mr. Tan, please.

4
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,460
provide。

5
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,000
同埋佢嘅誒同事出席啦，嚇。

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,940
議程先，如果大家睇下反反對啦，如果唔係，我哋都係。

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,680
誒，我想咧就好唔好啦？就我哋先傾咗。

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,700
等等都係再等多十分鐘嘅啫嚇，即係而家我哋已經正式開咗會㗎啦。噉啊嚇，咁但係。

9
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:42,970
That the law draftsman has written to the committee to explain the situation, bearing in mind that advice which is consistent with what I said previously. What we're now proposing is to

10
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:11,170
Thank you, Chairman. Just very briefly, I think members asked a number of questions that we did follow up and responded in our submission. The one I would like to highlight really is the.

11
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:46,380
啊！呢個富麗叻嘅草王咧，噉我哋先請咧就呢個誒西九嘅朋友咧，就誒去解答一下、介紹一下。咁誒，我哋首先歡迎啊！

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
嗱，不過咧，我哋今日嘅議程咧就分兩部分。第一部分咧就係接應嘅團體嘅，聽佢哋意見。咁誒，翻嚟嘅團體咧都唔係太多，噉就有五個團體，但係有三個咧就話應承嚟，到而家都未到。

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:51,380
如果大家喺度等，就好似好嘥大家時間。我好冇我意見咧，就好冇傾咗我哋第二部分，請西九文化區嘅代表，即係解咗我哋上次提好多問題先。如果喺十五分鐘之內有團體到。

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:11,670
我哋咧就喺佢哋解完之後咧，我哋就暫停咧，就恢復翻去第一個議程，聽下團體嘅意見。如果過咗十五分鐘佢都都未到，我哋就取消第一個、第一個、第一個議程啦，係嘛？即係你我哋一路做咁冇理由。

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:31,680
嚇！即係你成半個鐘頭，最後先係到噉。我又我又開翻呢個議程，因為好多同事可能就已經去咗其他會議啊，或者其他地方。我諗呢個都係公平啲去處理，好唔好啊？好，如果冇反對嘅咧，我哋就咁處理啦。咁好嘛？我哋而家就開會先，就先傾第二個議程咧，就係關於呢個西九文化區嘅。

16
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,050
嗯。

17
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,220
原來冇嘅。

18
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,320
嗰個誒。

19
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,750
請舉手，係係啊！

20
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,190
大家嘅先，多謝主席。

21
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,490
O.K.，大家有冇提問？

22
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,000
梁家傑，再冇啊！請舉手。噉啊，每人誒暫時四分鐘，連問連答先啦，係嘛？

23
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,470
即係我哋要求話將個願景同埋使命嘅陳述咧，原來係擠咗喺邊嘅？

24
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:20,080
which I understand is not acceptable. That's why we're now proposing that it goes into a preamble, essentially before the title heading.

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:18,640
即係原來擠在喺邊？一而家咧，佢話擠喺佢話擠喺嗰個誒序言嗰度啊嘛。原來係喺邊度㗎？

26
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:51,200
草業專員嘅意見咧，就佢將嗰個誒願景同埋使命咧，就擠咗喺佢個序言嗰度。咁原本係擠喺邊嘅？我想知資料提供啫。

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:20,170
I think we have addressed all of those in our submission. We have provided the guidelines on assistance from the police. We have also provided the guidelines on the use of reasonable force. So I think we've covered all of those points. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:03:02,960
for the a sort of preamble to the to the bylaw, which will state the the relevant the relevant section that members have asked for. So we will make that adjustment. As far as the the remaining

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:31,460
The suggestion that we should include in the bylaw the guiding principles that the use of the public open space should be open, accessible wherever possible, and to require us, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, to enforce the bylaws in a way which aims to achieve the mission. We understand.

30
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:58,480
主席，我我多謝柏志高先生頭先誒個解釋啦，即係誒，尤其是係法律草擬專員封信咧誒，我都睇咗嘅。但係我就係想誒，阿柏志高先生提供一個資料嘅，就係原本嗰個誒草擬文本咧，係將誒。

31
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,720
呀。

32
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,890
This。

33
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,950
你 welcome.

34
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,160
誒。

35
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,380
係咩？Tom Johnson Two噉。

36
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,390
We are welcome.

37
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,760
Do you have any comment on?

38
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,330
But I'm just interested to know.

39
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,300
主席，這係律師會給的建議。

40
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,770
And that's that's the distinction that's been accepted from the Lord Drausman's advice.

41
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,460
I see, Chairman. So, so the preamble will appear immediately.

42
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:48,630
這是什麼？我們做了，但我們現在必須重新考慮，以律師的建議為依據，我們現在把它作為前言，仍然放在前面，但不會干擾起草條約。

43
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:17,880
Immediately after the title, which says West Kowloon Cultural District Public Open Spaces by law, and before the interpretation section, is that my understanding? That, Mr. Chairman, that's correct. 好，多謝主席。

44
00:05:47,210 --> 00:06:04,700
If you look at page two, the last section, he explains or she explains exactly what the the formula should be. The the existing enacting formula located immediately after the title heading included extraneous text relating to the purpose of the bylaw. That's where that appeared.

45
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:40,700
誒，佢白大攞冇嘅，唔係係啊！我知交嚟嗰份嘢就冇啦。但係即係如果照法律草擬專員嗰封信咧，佢係原來執咗喺某一個位置嘅，佢就認為唔係好適當，執喺嗰個位置，噉就建議咧執喺另外一個地方。咁而家咧，柏志高先生就話西九管理局咧就接受咗。

46
00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:12,700
Mr. Chairman, perhaps I can clarify. The the original submission from us when we did the very first draft would have had some additional references in the enacting formula, which I understand was not, in other words, immediately after the title heading.

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:47,210
主席，If I may, Mr. Mr. Prescott, I still am not able to follow you. Where did the mission statement originally appear in the draft that you submitted to the Lord Draftsman for advice? Yeah, if you you you said you've seen Lord Draftsman's letter. Letter, yes.

48
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:36,620
Where did you put the mission statement? Originally, originally we put it there. Oh, you put it there? That's right. I see, I see. Yeah, because we felt it was indeed. If if members may recall during the subcommittee discussion of the bylaw, members did ask that we put it right up front as an opening statement, which

49
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,740
啊。

50
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,940
到政府。

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,420
我回問佢阿叔。

52
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
委員。

53
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,590
多謝主席。

54
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
suggestion about your later return.

55
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,850
我們唔提供 drafting 服務。

56
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,070
所以，有個初始觀察，係 set out in that letter。

57
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,880
It's very much around vetting that legislation.

58
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,070
You will have received my letter of the eleventh of April.

59
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,280
that the Department of Justice is only responsible for providing legal advice.

60
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,950
as set out in that letter, it's not usual for the law draftsman to appear.

61
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:51,000
所以當我們 vet the legislation， we are looking for consistency with the standard format of Hong Kong legislation.

62
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:42,870
我們也唔提供法律建議或決定內容，的立法，如擬議的《條例》。

63
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:03,320
在 Subcommittee meetings， where the proposed legislation is legislation not by the government， but by a non-government entity such as the authority who is here today。

64
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:27,510
not to non-government entities. So our role is very much in relation to the proposed legislation by non-government entities such as the West Kaluan Cultural District Authority.

65
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,830
by way of location.

66
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,920
它係咪一啲嘢？

67
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
when vetting the legislation.

68
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,830
Mission and vision statement.

69
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,700
Mission and vision matters.

70
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,210
我們也 look for presentational matters.

71
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,040
and made the comment that that was inappropriate.

72
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,120
我們 may also make observations during that process.

73
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,400
如果我可以address the particular matter that was raised around the.

74
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,450
或，for example， if there is a penalty without an offence。

75
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,720
律法 drafting division has no authority over the legislation.

76
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,070
Matters like incorrect references, grammatical errors and typos.

77
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,970
and those observations may be around things like plain English readability.

78
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,650
我們也做了觀察，那Section Four Two of the Empowering Ordinance set out.

79
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,150
一名官員喺律草案起草部門指出，呢個係包括喺立法公式入面嘅。

80
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:29,090
那些觀察是基於非政府實體，例如這裡的機構，做出自己的決策，就政策和內容而言，並承擔政策和內容的責任。

81
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,470
bureau。

82
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,320
The instructing.

83
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
and as explained, the inclusion or non-inclusion.

84
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,930
律法 drafting division also made observations with.

85
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,150
作為一matter of courtesy，我係 happy to stay for this meeting.

86
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,110
律師 drafting division made no further comment on the issue.

87
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,720
與The Bureau of the Law Drafting Division's Limited Role。

88
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,840
and it continued to make its own decisions on final policy and on drafting.

89
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,320
我 mention here, of course, too, that the authority has an independent legal adviser.

90
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,910
about matters that came to its attention during the vetting process, but there was a clear understanding.

91
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:18,370
and that the authority need take on board only those comments that were made regarding format.

92
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,220
of this or any other matter in the bylaw is not a matter for the Department of Justice to decide.

93
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,080
我強調，那、那不是法律起草部門要決定的，那應該在別處做。

94
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:19,140
第三 thing that we said was that if in fact the authority wished to include a mission or vision statement in the bylaw and

95
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:37,040
後續草稿，我們收到的，刪除了目的文句，從動文法中，不插入目的，其他。

96
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:47,030
但，我係 happy  to answer questions regarding format or the matters of vetting. It would be appropriate to direct questions regarding policy or content elsewhere.

97
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,590
Okay.

98
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,370
係，阿胡志偉。

99
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,140
多謝主席。我沒有進一步的質詢。

100
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,470
Thank you. Oh, thank you, Mr. Madam Johnson.

101
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,780
我唔係噉。我謝謝 honourable member for his question。

102
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
way or means of handling it.

103
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,070
In due course, and whether that.

104
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,980
Thank you, Chairman. If I may.

105
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:00,420
That is of for the purpose of including the mission and vision statement is acceptable to the law draftsman.

106
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:34,640
我我我 just wondering whether the law drafter or the responsible officer in your department has.

107
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:43,960
read the preamble as suggested by Mr Duncan Pescott that they would introduce to this subcommittee.

108
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:40,430
誒，其他同事仲有冇誒意見？對於嗰個即係願景擺喺個變現嗰度，有冇意見？如果冇咧，我哋就再誒。

109
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:25,630
welcome the Lord Ruffman to the subcommittee meeting, and particularly the fact that she has made an exception to appear before a subcommittee, which, of course, we are grateful.

110
00:11:51,910 --> 00:12:07,420
嗱，而家其實咧就大家都同意擺㗎啦，不過即係擺喺前言嗰度咧，依個係擺喺第一條前邊咧，咁即係依個大家畀意見啫，係嘛？咁首先大家如果有意見，再請舉手啦嚇。阿梁家傑。

111
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:27,000
而而，使用前言在附屬法例中並非常見，但並非無先例。在香港，我亦無見到困難，於包括前言。至於內容，當然要由當局決定。

112
00:13:42,790 --> 00:14:02,800
多謝主席。誒有一個細嘅查詢，因為我留意到咧，即係喺一啲嘅係誒工作人士嘅回應裏邊咧，就提到一點就係喺西九文化管理區裏邊咧，即係我而家用嘅詞彙叫休憩嘅。咁唔知可唔可以講一講，即係呢個所謂休憩好休閒用地或者文化嘅嘅部分嘅事？

113
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,150
嗯，多謝主席。

114
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,610
好嘛？關於休憩用地，阿張小姐講，等等。

115
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,360
嘅範圍裏邊，可以作為一個係。

116
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,090
sale of food subject to all of the relevant.

117
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,060
That all users of the park and open space have proper respect for other users.

118
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,760
可能係生活體驗好文化嘅一個反映嘅一個部分咧，我想想了解呢一點。

119
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:43,130
Some refreshments. We have a kiosk, for example, and we would expect there to be opportunities for properly organised.

120
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:59,660
Hong Kong legislation for safety and hygiene etc. So that's something we are already looking at. But as far as unrestricted access, that would not be permissible.

121
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:13,080
我我可唔可以咁理解，即係話咧？誒喺公眾嘅一啲查詢裏邊所聲稱嘅一啲，譬如小販咧，其實就唔會存在喺呢個世界文化管理區。

122
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:57,520
係會由西九文化管理局管嘅啦嘛，咁所以我瞭解呢一部分啫，多主席。咁即係阿胡議員就講兩樣嘢啫，一樣就係休憩呢個用詞係適唔適當喺我哋啲情況例法例裏邊，同埋嗰個文化包含。

123
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:33,740
legislation that applies in Hong Kong in terms of food safety etc etc would apply within the within the park and open space area anyway. We are already looking at and have already within the nursery park provided

124
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:22,810
因為佢一路都強調就話文化，可能嗰個概念好廣泛都唔定。譬如而家呢度可能以藝術文化作為基礎啦，咁但係誒誒飲食文化會唔會都係喺你呢個條例去裏邊可以覆蓋嘅東西？咁如果係覆蓋到，譬如飲食文化，可能牽涉到一啲即係誒。

125
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:43,240
誒，可能啲熟食經營都唔頂嘅，或者小販經營都唔頂嘅。咁呢啲嘅情況，即喺現有嗰個西九管理嗰個條例下邊，或者呢一個嘅嘅議嘅係即法律審草擬嘅過程裏邊咧，其實係用咗乜嘢機制咧，係去誒納入個規範裏邊嘅咧？因為你呢一步咧係即到其實呢個場地本身就係。

126
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:17,810
Okay, yeah, okay, Mr. Chan, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll leave Monica to answer on Yao Hei. It's it was something that we actually debated as to the use of that phrase, because we do want to be as general as we can, but perhaps Monica can address that specifically. On the issue of hawkers, of course, all the normal

127
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:44,050
Mr. Thank you. We, for example, are looking at different ways to activate the space. That may include, for example, a food festival with properly licensed food stalls, but unrestricted hawker access.

128
00:16:44,050 --> 00:17:04,060
I'm afraid is not going to be considered acceptable, simply on the hygiene and food safety grounds. So I'm afraid you know there is always going to be a balance in a public space, and that balance we will be looking to ensure all at all times that people who come into the park and open space can do so safely, and

129
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,460
係啊！

130
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
大家對於依樣嘢就冇。

131
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,190
如果冇咧，我諗請誒。

132
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,950
願景同埋使命，大家仲冇咩提問？

133
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,930
翻譯嘅中文嗰個誒條例嘅。

134
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,710
喺喺第一題誒，關於嗰個。

135
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,500
誒西九文化區管理嗰個法例本身嘅。

136
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,540
傾緊呢一個負例咧，因為我哋係要誒跟翻嗰個誒。

137
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,300
我想回應一下咧，就係因為呢一個，嗯，我哋而家。

138
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:58,610
已經係誒用咗公眾休憩用地嘅，咁所以咧，我哋係誒要跟隨跟隨呢一個嘅。

139
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:16,260
主席有冇跟進啊？嚇，多謝主席。就因為咧，其實喺誒康文署管嘅一啲公園嘅場地咧，其實都會誒。

140
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:49,460
經過一啲嘅程序審批之下、規範之下咧，係令到佢有噉嘅功能或者功效咧發生得到。譬如話，可能將來有機會搞年宵嘅時間，可能選擇呢個世界文化管理區裏邊嘅啲合適場地都唔定。

141
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:26,000
For example, on the very last event, we had a special marketplace aimed at dog lovers and pet lovers. So we have various different types of operation to to activate the park, and certainly that sort of market approach is is is within our intention. Yes.

142
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:49,910
本身嗰個用詞嘅噉，如果誒，如果各位睇翻第三段誒嘅E嗰度咧，係誒有解釋誒related facilities，即係相關設施嗰度。咁E嗰度咧係叫做public open space，而嗰個誒中文嘅翻譯咧係。

143
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:36,550
喺一啲條件之下咧，係開放去作為一啲好似市集啊，可能去墟市啊呢啲噉嘅做法。噉我想了解下就話喺而家我哋西九文化管理區裏邊，其實係做得到嘅，還是係做唔到嘅事情咧？係咪會好似呢個康文署所管嘅場地噉樣樣？喺某啲條件之下，其實你可以係即係經

144
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,980
Okay.

145
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,840
聽唔聽到咩？

146
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,820
Thank you.

147
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,400
Could you explain that?

148
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,000
誒，Madam Johnson，please。

149
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:51,160
The preamble is certainly of value in interpreting provisions within.

150
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:37,600
冇呢一個噉樣嘅，即係唔可能有呢個作用嘅，或者呢方面咧，可能喺而家律政司嘅法律專業喺度嘅時候，都可以去作一個嘅解釋嘅。

151
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:00,880
法例，到 which it's a preamble， the extent to which it governs outcomes is one for ultimately for judicial interpretation.

152
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:16,450
我我唔知道法律顧問，你頭先嘅誒，即係質質疑啊，係咪Law Draftman已經答咗？因為你好似有有個問題。

153
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:05,440
個兩點啊，係誒作為一個指引，或者係要貫徹呢兩點，可唔可以寫清楚呢個概念咧？噉樣我冇咁寫啦。

154
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:53,030
主席，我就想問下阿柏志高先生咧，其實佢嗰個誒序言咧，幾時可以誒將嗰個文本交嚟我哋呢個委員會睇一睇？

155
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:31,740
二，The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority aims to manage the open space in ways which aim to achieve the mission for the open space to inspire, promote and encourage cultural pursuits for all. So it's a very simple statement. Of course, as Lord Dawson pointed out, that's already in the ordinance anyway, so it replicates it.

156
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:35,960
你覺得係誒喺preambule度係唔會有任何嘅約束力係咪？你嘅意思係咪咁？誒，因為如果係一個嘅即係法律嗰個草擬嘅角度嚟講咧，其實嗰個最然嗰個作用咧，就係提供一個即係話係嗰個誒附例立法嗰個背景。

157
00:18:50,340 --> 00:19:10,350
Mr. Chairman, yes, I can confirm that that's certainly our intention. And indeed, operating the nursery park for the last eight to eight nine months, we have had a number of market operations during free space happenings on the second and the second last Sunday of the month. We

158
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:13,580
係，係噉樣。Mr. Chairman, we have already given the text. It's in our submission. I can read it out if members are interested. The text that we intend to use is: Whereas, one, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority aims to provide or facilitate the provision of free and accessible open space within the leased area to the general public.

159
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:53,890
誒，主席，我就係想提一提咧，就係誒喺呢一個罪言嗰度咧，可唔可以誒考慮誒寫埋落去咧？就係話當執行嗰個誒附例嘅時候咧，誒應該係以呢一個誒罪言裏邊所講。

160
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:29,500
誒多謝主席。咁其實就住頭先阿梁議員嗰個提問咧，誒瞭解當中咧就係話，其實嗰個罪嫌咧就係話去即係誒係提供一個呢一個即係附例嗰個嘅即係立法嘅背景。咁至於用呢個附例咧去即係凌駕於嗰個條文咧，即係如果個條文本身係清晰毫無疑問嘅話咧，嗰個罪嫌咧係並冇。

161
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,410
呃。

162
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,950
by comparing.

163
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,520
Specifically, ask this question.

164
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,640
可唔可加到嚟？誒誒，Chairman，if I may。

165
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,890
And therefore, we.

166
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,060
where the law draftsman will find under four， bracket one。

167
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,950
如果你講到係話用一個罪言咧，係令到即係話想去誒。

168
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,740
The enforcement agency, which in this case would be WKCDA authority.

169
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,400
set out the functions of the authority, and under bracket two, there is.

170
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:17,740
by drawing a comparison with section 4 of the main ordinance in chapter 601.

171
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:41,010
We really want to make sure that in enforcing this set of bylaws.

172
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,410
一聲明，要説，該機關將在第1款下履行其職能，以達成以下目標。

173
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:32,270
since we have the law draftsman here, and I hope the law draftsman knows where I came from.

174
00:23:49,060 --> 00:24:00,220
will not enforce it in such a way that would result in a very restrictive use of the open space in WKCD.

175
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:16,200
要特別係提到呢一點嘅，即係不能夠削弱到即係話個別條文，因為如果真係要睇翻個別條文咧，我哋就要仔細去斟酌，就多個話喺嗰個罪嫌嗰度咧，去誒有一個即係有呢個功能咯嚇。我想帶出嚟就係呢一點嘅。

176
00:22:42,230 --> 00:23:02,240
去即係凌駕於個別條文嗰個噉嘅功能咧。誒，我理解咧就係話誒，唔係去到呢一種噉樣嘅，即係有呢種噉樣嘅做法嘅。咁呢一個，所以誒，我就想而家喺即係阿法律草擬專員喺度嘅時候，其實呢一個亦都係誒睇翻我哋一般即係誒法律草擬嗰個噉樣嘅功能上面咧，係即係。

177
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,530
唔使。

178
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
If.

179
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,510
Thank you, Mr. Leun.

180
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,770
Sure that the.

181
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,650
我 believe will be given.

182
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,760
I think that is the that is the point, Chairman.

183
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,360
但perhaps我could make some general observations.

184
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,020
predominant effect when it comes to interpreting.

185
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,370
什麼 enforcement and the scope of the bylaw.

186
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,270
我若要 refer to the actual words that are set out in the proposed preamble.

187
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,980
所以section four one和section four subsection two。

188
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,450
Now, what I want to achieve by the preamble and the

189
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:53,480
一係，係，

190
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:43,090
它不是通常的案例，對於法律起草部門來説，實際上要就非政府立法的法律效果提出意見。

191
00:24:45,730 --> 00:25:05,740
Learned adviser to this subcommittee is querying whether by including something like well in enforcing this set of bylaws, the WKCDA ought to make.

192
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:28,070
The two points made by Mr. Pescod in the preamble would be sufficiently observed and given effect to. That sort of statement, if it is included in the preamble, will it have the effect that we intended?

193
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,430
O.K.

194
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,730
Mr. Tan, please.

195
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,000
前言又好引用翻。

196
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,480
Any comments on Mr. Lam's suggestions?

197
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,070
我聽到法律草擬專員咧就冇話噉樣唔得啊，當然我明白即係佢嘅。

198
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,770
誒，主體法例咧，應該都可以滿足到你所講嘅嘢。

199
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,070
我唔 believe， on my reading of them， that they。

200
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,190
邊仲有一個主體法例去涵蓋咗佢？噉你引用翻。

201
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,300
我，我唔 feel 質疑化到給，任何 legal opinion eyond that。

202
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:28,340
嗱，誒誒，主席啊，即係噉，當然睇下其他委員點樣睇啦。但係即係我我點解會話覺得誒頭先啊？

203
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:37,570
在一種 sense， take the matter any further than to evince an intention that this is the way in which the authority will administer the bylaw.

204
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:49,030
即係寫得清楚，就係你一同二寫出嚟啦。就係當執行嘅時候，你係咧係用一同埋二作為一個誒，即係指導咧誒，同埋貫徹佢咧咁解啫。好啊，阿何志高。

205
00:26:47,500 --> 00:27:07,510
我諗係咪可以解到解到你咧？阿梁梁副主席個意見咧，因為拗起上嚟你都有個條例已經係overshadow咗佢，蓋過咗佢呢個附例㗎啦，係嘛？即使頭先阿法律顧問講呢個前言，只不過係一個背景資料，但係你喺上邊。

206
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:48,630
柏志高先生講嗰度咧，如果係可以誒寫得即係畫工仔畫出長一啲，即係話咧誒，當嗰個嗯負例啊係被執行嘅時候咧，頭先講嘅一同埋二咧係會誒即係。

207
00:27:48,630 --> 00:28:08,640
係應該獲得一個誒貫徹同埋考慮咧，就因為你呢一套誒符禮咧，始終係講緊管理嗰個場地啦。咁既然你寫得一同二咧，你不如寫得白啲，噉係咪即係仲好啲咧？我。

208
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,960
啊，要食蛋糕。

209
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,780
唔係，唔知啫。

210
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,140
even without the bylaws.

211
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,520
誒主席，我我唔打算再繼續跟進啦，我睇下其他委員點。誒，胡志偉，唔該。

212
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,880
所有嘅行政細節咧，就寫曬喺個法喺個法例裏邊㗎嘛，咁誒。

213
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,020
If the Lord Draffyn's not in a position to advise on that, I'm damn sure I'm not. I'm sorry.

214
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:51,470
and two that you just read out from your draft, which I do not have, would

215
00:29:52,020 --> 00:30:03,850
have a, well, I don't know how I should put it. It should have a overarching effect, or it will, it will, well, those.

216
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:24,340
Well, Mr. Peskov, as I understand Lord Altham, who was so kind as to make an exception to render some legal advice, which strictly speaking ought not to be within her turf.

217
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:33,360
佢佢已經好人啦，因為佢一一一般嚟講，佢係唔應該喺度畀法律意見嘅。我明白噉，但係咧，我就反而今次想問下柏志高先生，即係佢既然去到寫咗嗰個序言嘅一同埋二啦，雖然我而家冇嗰個文本喺度，我聽佢講嘅啫，但係一同埋二可唔可以再即係送佛送到西？

218
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:44,630
I'm just asking you as the administrator whether you would take the extra mile by reciting in the recitals that when it comes to implementing those bylaws, the points one.

219
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:24,140
enforcing the set of bylaws will give sufficient consideration to points one and two in the draft or the draft proposed by recitals that you just read out. Something along this line，主席。好嘛，簡單啲答啦，好嘛。

220
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:47,370
是是第一， obviously we can't do anything that's in contravention of the ordinance. The ordinance has much more power than this anyway, so I think that's that's the first point. So we must be compliant with the ordinance. But second point, it seems to me that the most important thing from our point of view is to ensure that all of the.

221
00:30:47,370 --> 00:31:07,380
Instructions, guidelines and other documentation that we provide to our team is given the same preconceived perspective. In other words, that they are they will be required to adopt that particular approach in their administration of the of the bylaw.

222
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:27,410
所以我認為那會address你的點。它係已經在序言裡，而我們會強化那在指引和其他指示和手冊。因為它絕對，我想要明確這一點，它是我們在所有時候都採用那種方法。而我認為我們已經在育嬰場所已經展現了那種方法。

223
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:55,120
代主席，我諗啱啱柏志高先生咧就答咗我嘅一個諗法，因為咧我理解就係話個by loss佢寫清寫錯嘅話，咁好自然就係喺我哋審議嘅過程裏邊都會係即係根據翻即係原先PMB所講嘅內容咧，係作為基準去考慮佢係唔係搣到嗰個PMB。

224
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:15,130
部所講嘅條件，然後我哋就即係誒同意或者不同意嗰個相關嘅安排。咁因此就話喺個by law裏邊咧，其實就如果係啲明文規定嘅東西嘅話咧，就理論上喺我哋成個憤即係法律審議嘅過程裏邊咧，應該處理到嘅。我我諗大家最大嘅concern就話，因為你唔可能係將

225
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,770
明白。

226
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,970
嗯。

227
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,890
用任何方法都得嘅。

228
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,370
你高願唔願意加依句？

229
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,730
我理解係噉樣樣嘅，會食得。我覺得就係話誒，第一。

230
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,700
頭先我聽到白志高先生講，就話佢佢會係喺嗰個行政嘅手段上邊咧，係確保誒。

231
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:42,940
again, Mr. Chairman, I guess this is a this is a drafting issue. I'm not sure that it's necessary because of our the obligation to comply, but we can perhaps look at that.

232
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:50,470
I think it's important that we all recognise that we are obliged to follow both the ordinance, which contains much more detail in terms of the principle, and the bylaw. Once they're enacted, there's absolutely no question.

233
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:24,230
誒咁誒，亦都係可能引喻到呢個都係有一個凌駕性啊，或者係一個誒，即係誒，即係有一個所有法例都要會誒喺呢個底下之下進進行嘅，可唔可以寫明個注釋喺邊度咧？

234
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:26,400
realistically you can have a you can have a lovely bit of paper but if it's not enforced properly and consistently then we would have a problem and we would be prosecuted presumably so I can give you that assurance but I don't see that there's a need for further reinforcement because by definition we must comply.

235
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:48,000
當個園區裏邊嘅同事要執行呢啲法例嘅時間，要寫嗰個instruction好，cul practis都好啦，都會係根據嗰個嘅P.M.B所講嘅內容去做。咁第一個當然啦，即係呢個公開承諾可能其中一部分啦，但係就係其實會唔會係喺嗰個審議，即係喺個法案。

236
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:08,010
草業過程裏邊咧，其實有一句噉嘅説話可以延shout到落去，噉啊變咗確保就係話，即係嗰個誒西九管理局咧都要係即係喺去準備所有嘅instruction嘅時間咧，都應該就要係即係按照呢個plan部所講嘅條件咧，係去去準備咁解。我我。

237
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:32,170
夠唔夠咧？由呢一個嘅administrations嗰邊去一個公開嘅承諾，係咪已經足夠去處理嗰件事，還是就話我哋需要喺個法案裏邊咧係有句嘅説話咧，就係講誒管理局管理當局咧都會係按照呢一個噉嘅係example咧係去係即係草擬相關嘅執行細節噉樣樣。好啊，啊。

238
00:33:50,750 --> 00:34:10,760
That we would not follow that. That that's a that that point must be emphasised. And and I what I'm suggesting beyond that is that in complying with the ordinance and with the bylaws, we will also ensure that all our staff are properly briefed to ensure compliance. I think that's the key issue here because.

239
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:49,240
啊！我都有對依樣嘅有個意見咧，睇下啊，陳志高可唔可以解釋咧？即係可唔可以答覆咧？就係話，如果我哋寫咗依個願景之後咧，可唔可以有個註釋？就係根據係《主體法例》第幾章第幾節係係引述出嚟嘅噉樣。因為你你有時你喺你嘅園區或者某一啲適當嘅地方。

240
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,780
OK。

241
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,130
提高。

242
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,160
好似係朱元璋。

243
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,760
講咗佢專員講咗啲嘢先。

244
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,560
啊，零三嗰份文件。

245
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,770
誒，你哋再有冇問題要問誒法律專員啦？

246
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,920
歡碌嘅嚇，唔係頭先所講嘅意見。我知道。O.K.，佢話翻嚟睇睇。

247
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,970
係，咁跟住咧，我哋好唔好都係跟翻誒啊？

248
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:57,160
誒法律顧問有冇其他嘅傾向？如果冇，我哋就係完咗依一部分。阿陳議員係咪都係關於市民？OK。

249
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:04,280
你頭先講咗Paragraph Two，請阿法律誒草業專員可以離離職啦，佢好忙啊嘛嚇。我哋講完啊嘛。

250
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:20,010
我講嘅係講寬碌，就唔係你嘅。唔係唔係，我講佢，我講緊佢講而答我哋問題先。佢頭先係答我嘅問題。我知道。嚇，噉佢就話佢翻去睇睇先，look it。

251
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:51,560
誒，我諗誒，頭先啊柏志高嗰份文件之後，仲有幾個問題，你需唔需要再介紹埋？如果唔係，我哋個會就讓大家睇下仲有冇其他問題，然之後去調問㗎啦。

252
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:19,550
如果冇嘅咧，誒，我哋好多謝誒法律專員啊啊咩都莊順嚟呢度嚇。噉我知道你哋好忙，所以你哋可以先行離職嚇。

253
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:51,210
咁誒誒，柏志高先生，你會唔會就你個文件第三、第四、第五，仲誒之後嘅咧會再誒討論、講介紹一下，抑或誒？

254
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:10,060
係，咁都想跟進，係咪真係有機會將我哋啲觀點擺咗落去咧？我都想問，係咪？正話正，我翻去睇睇。剛才白志高講話，我翻去睇一睇啦。噉我就想個意思咩意思？唔該。

255
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:33,190
係一嗰個係咪取消㗎啦？而家一即係第一行唔嚟㗎，冇嚟到啊！係因為已經過咗十五分鐘，全部都冇嚟到啊！係啊，而家到而家都未嚟，所以取消。Thank you，謝謝。

256
00:34:49,240 --> 00:35:09,250
你會顯示個大攞呢個附例出嚟嘅，噉你顯示個附例出嚟咧，噉啊，第一條、第二條大家都好清楚。突然間有個誒遠景喺度，使命喺度，咁人哋或者會話：依個係咪唔使跟㗎？係咪一定要跟依度啊？如果你有個注釋，依個都係睇主體法例出嚟嘅時候，人哋好清晰，依個都係法律嘅一部分啊。

257
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,860
我哋就完咗你呢份文件㗎啦，嚇！

258
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:01,610
Mr. Chairman, as I said, I think they were really just providing information to members, and we have provided the information requested.

259
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:11,880
啦，咁但係我會有即係我會跟住呢啲次序嗰度咁誒，逐樣問落去嘅。咁喺第三段嗰度咧。

260
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:38,640
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I just want to emphasise that the provisions that we are talking about here are no different to the general provisions under the law that any

261
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:10,710
The police, frankly, should be the only people who have those powers. So that's the first point. The second point, in respect of the actual equipment, they have minimal equipment. To be frank with you, they are not.

262
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:26,120
誒公園大士同高級公園大士咧，其實即係真係好似我哋嗰啲誒誒導賞人員噉嘅啫，即係完全係文職人員嚟嘅。但係保安部門嗰批係乜嘢人咧？咁呢個我關心。

263
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:21,360
都有一條法例係畀嗰個誒權力畀佢哋去使用合理武力，即係我哋自己都有誒誒指引啊，各樣嘢啊。噉我哋自己保安同事雖則唔係警隊人員，但係會知嘅。噉就同埋喺誒我哋保安同事。

264
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:11,930
嗱，呢啲都係我哋關注嘅，即係佢哋究竟係好似食環噉，即係冇乜裝備，定抑或好似警隊咁好多裝備？咁同埋佢哋請嘅，我見到咧，佢有公園大師啦，高級公園大師啦，亦都有保安部門。咁嗱。

265
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:23,370
咁喺度咧，我哋即係係係係，我喺呢度咧就再佢既然介紹，即係講咗啲文件啦，同埋已經話冇其他補充咧。我想大家睇下總體有咩問題好嘛？或者你就你嘅問題咧提出曬先，至到條文嗰個度審議好嘛？嚇係啊，何所律誒誒，主。

266
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:43,380
呢份文件咧，誒誒，柏士高先生頭先讀咗佢嗰個preamb嗰個草擬文本呢份文件咧，其實後邊仲有好多係講嗰個合理武力。好，你咪問咯。O K，得啦，得。咪如果咪所有其他問題，O K，得，我放畀大家問。係，因為我我以為淨係。我叫佢介紹，佢話唔使介紹啊嘛。唔使。而家介紹嚟你問咯。O K。

267
00:38:43,380 --> 00:39:03,390
嗱，主席，噉我就逐段問落啊。四分鐘啊，連問連答。O K嚇，誒嗱，因為我我上次咧，我只我最大嗰個誒誒誒關注咧，就係誒乜嘢人使用合理武力嚇，咁誒立法會咧，我哋啲保安同事咧。

268
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:41,960
誒誒執行咗維持秩序之後，點樣交接畀誒警隊？我哋係有曬指引嘅，咁所以我都即係好想好想知道，即係清楚睇翻誒西九呢個文化區嗰度咧，係邊啲係獲授權人員？咁嗱，我我都多謝西九。

269
00:39:41,960 --> 00:40:01,970
管理局咧，佢就畀咗即係詳細嘅誒指引畀我哋嘅。咁裏邊就有誒爆炸品啊，或者係誒自殺企圖自殺啊、樹木倒冧啊、遺失物品啊噉樣樣。咁主席，我就我就即係頭先誒誒，我等緊大家講嗰個辯言嗰度。

270
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,390
Honestly.

271
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,680
park users.

272
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,800
appropriate to that level of of interaction.

273
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,420
在 dealing with the public and dealing with our people who are using the facilities.

274
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,420
因為someone's playing with a ball and it you know gets out of control, goes into someone's picnic.

275
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,290
That is that's part of the logic that we're applying here. It's to ensure consistency.

276
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,860
whether it's outside staff or core staff, they will all go through the same training and they will be required to work to our standards.

277
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:51,640
我 do not want them to be involved in that confrontation. So the whole philosophy is to de-escalate and to avoid confrontation. And they are provided with equipment.

278
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:42,270
好啊，你打一打你哋個形式係係外判啲運作。Mister Chairman， I I think yes in due course as the size of the facility grows， we will have a core staff that are under our direct control。

279
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:28,850
保安部門噉係即係你係誒好似而家咁批一個合約出去啊，係出邊嘅誒私家保安隊伍啊，定係你哋自己即係有一個較為穩定啲嘅保安隊伍，即係好似我哋立法會咁咧？

280
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:32,760
就佢講咗嗰個誒合理武力啦。咁呢呢度咧就話佢係即係最低程度噉，同埋唔能夠懲罰同埋盡別盡快交畀警務人員嘅。咁嗱，呢呢三點係O K嘅，但係喺警務人員未嚟到之前。

281
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:53,180
警務人員未嚟到之前，即係如果嗰個情況係惡劣嘅，譬如好似佢後邊誒指引嗰度噉，即係有人嗰個精神狀況係失常啊，好難控制啊，諸如此類。噉你你嗰個誒獲授權人士佢係有啲咩裝備，佢可以使用啲咩裝備啊？各

282
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:59,230
member of the public can enforce in a situation. So if, as you quite rightly pointed out, you have someone who's disturbed and they're creating a situation, a member of the public can take reasonable force to calm the situation down. And that's the logic that we're applying. We're not giving them police powers. We don't want police powers. We think.

283
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:31,000
trained to be able to wrestle with people, they're not trained to be able to, you know, engage in direct physical confrontation. The whole point, and again, I want to emphasise, if you read what we said in three, is that it should be minimal, and it should stop as soon as necessary, as soon as appropriate, once the situation has been resolved.

284
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:51,010
Our approach at all times will be to to try and avoid escalation of a situation. It's always about de-escalating. If someone's confrontational, we want to try and remove him from the situation. But once they're removed, that's the end of the situation. So equipment is minimal, and that's deliberate. And the

285
00:42:51,010 --> 00:43:11,020
The level of interaction with the people is also intended to be minimal, so that's the philosophy that we've approached. It is already working very effectively in the nursery park context. Our park ambassadors have had to deal with some difficult situations, usually confrontations between.

286
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:41,140
All of the situations we've had to deal with so far have been able to be de-escalated by this approach of talking to the parties, getting a resolution, and that's the approach I want. However, in future under the bylaw, if there is a situation where it is escalating and it is getting out of control, I do want them to call in the police.

287
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:15,090
係啊，主席，即係嗱，呢個其實係兩難嘅情況嚟嘅。一即係如果情況好惡劣，我哋又驚佢即係唔及唔掂嚇。但係普普通通咧，我哋又唔想佢有大太大嘅權力，咪搞多個食環隊伍出嚟噉樣樣。噉你想點咧？咁但係但係頭先柏志高先生未答我，就係佢哋請咩人做嗰個？

288
00:44:42,550 --> 00:45:02,560
for peripheral staff. And for example, if we're running an event in the park, we bring in additional staff from outside security contractors. That's normal. We already do that. So for for large events like Free Space happening, we bring in additional resources. But the core staff will be our own staff, and that's the the philosophy. Does not matter.

289
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,670
活動能力。

290
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,400
嗯。

291
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,400
first of all， no handcuffs。

292
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,120
等到警方嚟咧，即係你呢個係咪授權到畀你咧？噉你可唔可以解釋下？

293
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,750
no, no ties, no ropes, no batons.

294
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:30,270
第二咧，你哋會唔會有一啲地方可以有權力去扣留佢咧、拘留佢一段時間咧？

295
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:51,180
於是乎佢哋唔會濫權啊，各樣。咁主席，我跟住問落去咧，即係如果冇人排隊，噉我我又唔係唔係，誒誒冇嚟嗰度啫，誒仲係冇其他人物。

296
00:45:51,580 --> 00:46:01,840
如果冇咧，我都都有啲問題嘅，我都有。我覺得咧，佢啊或者哥你答啊何秀娜，嗰啲使用嗰啲誒設備咧都唔答得唔夠嘅。你哋會唔會有武裝咧？

297
00:47:45,700 --> 00:48:00,240
again the bylaw will provide for the ability to retain someone, usually in our management office until such time as they can be handed over to the police. But that is provided for in the bylaw, and again training will be given.

298
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:41,710
O.K.啊，主席，即係我，我同意呢個方向嘅。因為如果佢哋即係就咁批出去咧，我哋大家最近都見到有啲新聞咧，就判出去嗰啲保安咧，有時都可能品流複雜，唔知係咩人。噉我係希望即係西九管理局咧，就即係會有自己一支好穩定嘅隊伍。咁慢慢有你哋嗰個即係機構文化。

299
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:22,310
你使會唔會食好一啲武器咧，甚至或者手扣咧？噉你如果你話要制服一啲人，唔想佢誒移走佢，你哋會淨係用對手啊，亦或會唔會用手扣啦，或者十啲索帶啦、膠帶啦、繩索啦，或者其他嗰啲嘢咧，令到佢去失去？

300
00:46:44,140 --> 00:47:04,150
That we would certainly not be providing to anybody. I don't think that's the appropriate message you'd want to give in a cultural or or a family situation. So absolutely not. In terms of of the the the sort of practical situation that you have to deal with.

301
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:25,690
this is something which I can perhaps best explain in terms of my experience in housing department. The housing department staff are not armed, they are not provided with equipment, and yet they have to deal with very very difficult situations all the time. But they are trained to de-escalate as well. They are trained to

302
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:45,700
remove people from a situation by inviting them to join them to escort them out. It's that sort of approach, and I think that works very, very well. Obviously, this is something that we will keep under review, and it's something that we are constantly looking at, even now with the events that we organise. In terms of detention.

303
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:20,670
唔係，多謝你啊！因為講呢樣嘢唔係好笑，因為主要咧，我哋要講清楚係嘛，即係你話冇武器就到時唔好真係出現到有咩情況都係你有武器。如果講嚟好似好好笑啊，警棍啊、繩索啲嘢，但我哋覺得佢法例就法例，大家講清楚啫啊，呢樣嘢。咁好多謝你嘅意見喺武力嗰度方面，仲冇其他提問。如果

304
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:40,890
係係，主席，我就想喺誒嗰個誒指引後邊嗰度咧，即係好快脆，我得誒四五個問題嘅啫。後邊指引嗰度，因為佢佢有個附件嘅，就係事故管理指引嗰度嚇，要警方誒協助嘅。噉嘅誒，我我逐度逐度問落嚟啦，可以嘛？即係如果冇。

305
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,620
嚇。

306
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,140
嗯。

307
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,240
會唔會唔畀佢入啊？

308
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,760
咁但係籤咗又點咧？

309
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:10,710
即係佢佢如果成日係常客，成日走嚟破壞，即係你你簽完一趟下趟又係噉啊！噉你點搞咧？

310
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:20,680
主席，跟住我就誒會問嗰個處理焦躁不安寵物動物嗰度喺誒第六頁嘅。

311
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:24,240
Mr. Chairman, this is something that we would like to avoid. We don't want to bar people from from situations, but at the same time, you know.

312
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:11,370
We will have an area within the park that they can do graffiti without any cost. If they do it in the wrong place, we want them to know it costs us to clean it up. It causes disturbance to other people. It's that sort of approach that we're taking.

313
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:16,780
the law applies within the park, except in those designated locations where dogs can be allowed to roam free, and those are already available within the nursery park context, and will, we hope, be available in the park in due course.

314
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:39,260
vandalism is is not a cost-free activity, so we're trying to balance the two things. I think if someone was a persistent vandal within a situation, then you would have to take steps to try and prevent them becoming, you know.

315
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:58,160
冇其他同事排隊嚇。我第一個想提出嘅咧，就係喺呢個破壞物件嗰度，即係喺指引嘅第四頁嚇。咁咧佢就話，即係如果係拒絕簽署承諾書咧，就會通知保安部門報警處理噉。

316
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:55,550
如果有啲誒寵物，佢攞曬訓練證明書啊，誒誒，香港都有呢啲課程畀寵物同埋寵物主人上㗎嘛。即係其實如果佢攞曬呢啲證明書咧，咁管理局係咪可以考慮即係有個license，所以畀佢哋即喺嗰度就唔需要受呢個法例管理咧咁？

317
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:59,550
being able to continue that that activity, this really is is as much about the person acknowledging what they've done as anything else. It's about making it clear to them that this, you know, young people they don't sometimes understand that by graffitiing, it seems it's just something that happens, but you know.

318
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:42,910
我我想問咧，香港即係而家我哋嗰個貓狗條例咧，即係譬如話中型以上嘅狗咧，就即係一定要有條嘅誒狗帶，係啦，或者喺公眾地方戴口罩嚇。咁呢個喺西九裏邊係豁免啦，定係照用㗎？係誒，Miss特登。嗯，梁。

319
00:50:42,910 --> 00:51:02,920
主席，當然，條ordinance適用。我們在WKCD內面有，而且我們會擴大這個範圍，是一個指定區域，讓狗可以放鬆，但我們的邏輯是，公園內面的狗必須受控，這意味著必須牽繩。

320
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:37,160
嘅，嗱，主席，即係我，我又我就係保護動物嘅，即係我又唔係寵物主人嚟嘅嚇。咁誒誒，其實寵物公園呢個概念係好好嘅。噉我我就希望誒西九管理局咧，即係實施咗一段期間之後，係可以即係檢討誒誒。如果即係當然啦，即係如

321
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,920
仲話冇。

322
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,320
你心儀啦，好嘛？

323
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,410
啊！有冇咩介紹？

324
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,540
噉我諗用中文先啦，係嘛？

325
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,110
如果唔反對，我哋就有得進行。

326
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,620
如果冇咧，我哋係咪誒？

327
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,040
我諗係一個平衡，因為通常。

328
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:00,000
誒，啊，Mr. Duncan，你先，possible。

329
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,710
佢逐條可以讀出嚟，我等我哋睇下冇意見啦，好嘛？

330
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,310
去到誒逐條逐項審審議佢條文嗰度。

331
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:24,440
誒我咧，我哋咧就主要咧就用中文版啦，係嘛？咁請西九嘅同事。

332
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:44,710
咁至於嗰個前言嗰度咧，我諗仲如果再一次會議咧，我哋就先至追翻前言嗰度審議啦。

333
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:55,310
Mr. Chairman, perhaps if we're going through the Chinese version, I'll ask Monica to take us through it. But we will follow up on the on the preamble separately, as you suggest.

334
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:59,530
即係而家可能都未係咁廣泛啦。咁但係及後如果係推廣得到，咁希望西九管理局可以考慮咯。嚇得啦，我暫且問曬住。係，其他同事仲有冇對於整份文件嘅附例啊、附件或者其他問題可以提問？

335
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:24,340
People are afraid of dogs, even if they're very friendly dogs. And I think it is correct to make sure that they're always under control. Where people know that a dog will be off the leash in the designated areas, that's the safest way. Then, then young children who don't get get afraid of a dog, even if it's very friendly, is it's not causing disturbance. And I think

336
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:44,350
那係，那係，那係。

337
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,450
喺。

338
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,520
誒。

339
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,320
你都識聽㗎啦。

340
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,910
咁誒，第二個誒。

341
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,050
通常會引用嘅一啲嘅誒。

342
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,560
咁第一步咧係導言，就係誒解釋喺呢個附例誒上邊誒。

343
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:47,830
我哋下次先要再翻翻轉頭講變現嗰度啦，好嘛？你講下低第一誒由目錄開始講。

344
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:52,280
批租地區入邊嘅任何公眾用地咧，係可以係誒劃定呢一個區域嘅。

345
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:26,910
關於相關設施入邊嘅醫嗰一段咧，係引用嘅，所以係誒，我哋係用咗公眾休憩用地呢個字。

346
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:24,560
第三條咧就係第三個字咧就係準許permission，噉我哋喺第四條咧就誒誒誒係引用咗呢一個字嘅。

347
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:24,920
西九文化區管理局附例第六零一章第三十七條係經立法會批准嘅規則之下訂立嘅。

348
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:14,330
係咁誒，就有關呢個西九文化區公眾休憩用地附例咧，就係由誒西九文化區管理局根據。

349
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:42,340
咁誒喺公眾休憩用地咧，我哋喺呢個扶勵上邊咧，我哋係誒會根據第五一條，我哋係誒管理局咧就會係。

350
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:39,290
咁誒，我哋咧就會加翻上呢個辯言。咁呢個辯言咧，就頭先我哋喺誒之前嘅討論入邊咧都有傾過㗎啦。噉我喺呢度咧就唔再重複。

351
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:16,020
字句啦，咁第一個咧就係公眾休憩用地，咁頭先咧誒我都已經解釋咗，呢個咧就係誒其實呢個公眾休憩用地嘅用字咧，我哋係跟翻嗰個主體法例嘅。

352
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:12,410
誒用詞咧就係呢個公園行政辦公室。噉我哋會喺誒呢個公園誒，即係誒呢個公眾休憩用地咧，我哋係有一個誒辦公室嘅誒建築物嘅。

353
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,550
由第五條開始。O.K.

354
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,740
誒同埋誒財物啊、財產嘅安全啦。

355
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:34,790
美國嘅人員、僱員或者其他人士係誒旅行。

356
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:32,070
讀曬條文出嚟嚇，咁唔係概括講講嗰樣嘢，好嘛？好嚇，你逐啊，你讀曬條文出嚟。

357
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:47,130
同埋喺誒，任何人都可以喺有秩序同埋唔受騷擾嘅情況之下咧，係享用公眾休憩用地嘅任何部分嘅。

358
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:59,820
咁另外啊，跟住落去咧，就係關於獲授權人士，我哋係根據第三條咧，係釐定係乜嘢係獲授權人士嘅解釋嘅。

359
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:46,340
獲授權人士喺呢個負例下邊嘅職能，或者執行其他形式係去履行或者誒同管負例相關或者有關嘅職能嘅。

360
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:39,550
誒跟住咧就係發布publish，咁呢個咧我哋係如果誒各位睇一睇第五條咧，我哋係講緊咧誒關於誒呢個誒。

361
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:22,880
就咧，通常都要誒比較有靈活性啦。咁所以咧，我哋係喺呢度咧，就係有一個準許嘅誒，即係嗰個誒。誒，我諗咧就你要逐個條讀曬條文出嚟嘅。

362
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:32,880
咁呢個係誒，亦都好重要啦，因為誒係誒，我哋而家扶例嘅主要目的咧，就係要誒能夠令到喺公眾休憩用地嘅人咧，係誒保障到佢嘅誒安全啦。

363
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:18,580
下一段咧就係誒確保公共安全或秩序，咁咧就係誒呢一個咧，我哋係誒引用誒即係海洋公園嘅副例入邊咧係誒有用到呢一句嘅。

364
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:59,940
公眾休憩用地嘅區域啊，或者有其他嘅適當嘅指示咧，我哋係會誒用呢個誒電誒一啲電腦或者其他器材咧，或者係一啲告示咧，係使到公眾咧能夠知道嗰個誒圖質係點樣。

365
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:28,870
咁跟住誒第二部分咧，我哋係誒誒畫出咗呢個誒，即係誒講咗呢個公園誒公眾休憩用地嘅界線啦、出入啦，係管理同埋控制嘅。咁誒主要嚟講咧，就係誒管理局咧，如認為合適咧，係可以授權任何管理。

366
00:58:49,970 --> 00:59:09,980
另外，因為係喺某一啲嘅情況，譬如啊籌辦一啲活動嘅時候咧，咁可能我哋會係書面上咧係準許某啲人士或者係獲授權人士係可以誒畀書面或者口頭嘅準許畀某一啲嘅誒人士，例如誒舉行活動嘅。

367
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:56,480
係，後生啦，有冇意見？想問翻第三、第四條啊，因為即係嗰個授權嗰度咧，係係我最關注嘅。噉我由第三條再開始啦，第三條嚟問。係啦，嗱，第三條嗰度咧，佢佢就講到管理局咧就可授權任何管理局人員、僱員或其他人士去行使。

368
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,610
咁誒？

369
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,900
誒，或者講。

370
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,640
要做 certain tasks within the the open space and the park.

371
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:59,870
即係請誒誒管理局翻去度一度，點樣區分開兩類咯？

372
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,570
Mr. Chairman, thank you. The point here is that.

373
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:34,580
暫時係去拘留住一啲破壞秩序嘅人，等佢移交警察。咁所以即係呢個權力其實唔細㗎。

374
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:29,640
到那些 people who are authorised, what their powers are. I think that's the best way: transparency and clarity for all users as to who has those authorised powers.

375
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:24,440
咁呢度，因為佢確實即係喺誒嗰個維持誒誒公共安全或秩序嘅時候，可能真係會牽涉到要做一個決定係誒。

376
01:00:49,290 --> 01:01:02,250
暫時拘留一啲破壞規則嘅人，等待移交畀警隊。咁呢啲獲得呢一類權力嘅人，係應該喺某個職級以上寫得翻清楚啲咧。

377
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:48,890
好似你嗰個指引裏邊咁咧，甚至有啲係志願人士添噉啊嚇！噉佢哋係咪獲得呢個授權咧？係咪應該講清楚，即係獲去維持秩序，甚至係可以誒？

378
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:28,920
Obviously, for our own employees and officers, we have to authorise them. But as as I've already indicated, we will be employing outside contractors to provide some services, including security services. And in those cases, we need to be able to authorise those people to have

379
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:34,880
確實裏邊係有啲係可能引起衝突嘅。咁如果你喺呢度好概括噉樣講話，可以授權，甚至話其他人士都可以履行呢個職能咧，我會即係你冇翻嗰個層次咧，我會有啲擔心咯。啊，即係會唔會誒誒？

380
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:16,490
嗰個職能咁當然咧，即係職能係有兩部分嘅，即係有兩個層次。一啲就係誒你搭佢迷路啊，邊樣嘢喺邊度啊，噉就係嗰啲公園大事啊嗰啲啦。我見到嚇咁呢啲係即係大家唔擔心話有咩衝突，但係咧你去到即係我哋頭先睇嗰個指引嗰度咧。

381
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:49,210
Certain powers within under the bylaw. It's it's that context, and certainly not. I would not anticipate someone who is simply volunteering having any of these authorised permissions. That is not the intention of this of this provision. This is specifically to allow us to employ outside contractors.

382
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:13,050
啊！主席，其實誒柏志高先生以前都係政府官員啦，即係佢佢誒誒可能即係涉獵到保安範圍嘅時候，我哋都提出亦都以前係有法例係咁寫，就係即係譬如行使到某一類權力嘅時候，係要求列明係某個職級以上㗎嘛，係嘛？

383
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:54,870
所以我我希望西九管理局咧，你翻去諗一諗，或者你而家你答唔到我嚇，但係你翻去諗一諗點樣區分開一個普通做旅客查詢誒做導遊誒嗰一類嘅職能，同埋去到可能要暫時拘留一啲破壞規矩嘅人嗰個權力。噉我我。

384
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:20,160
Mr. Chairman, in fact, this is one of the issues that we've looked at, and we want to make it very clear who has the authority has would be granted under this. So we're looking at having those people who are authorised to have a badge that indicates who they are and what the authorities are. So it will be very transparent to to all users as to and.

385
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,830
先嚇。

386
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:13,980
可以。

387
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,630
你理解。

388
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,330
例如。

389
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,110
仲有冇其他人對第四條有提問？

390
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,750
如果冇咧，我哋就去第四條。

391
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:29,910
但係，係小事情，你知唔知？人會話：，我丟咗個球喺樹，我可唔可以去揾佢？

392
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:57,950
O.K.咁誒，對於第三條，大家同時各位議員仲有冇其他意見同埋提問咧？

393
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:38,000
你唔係要寫一張note，that says，this person has the permission to go up the tree。你係just要say yes，and it's that context。

394
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:12,610
Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, if you look at Section 10, which deals with conduct of conduct of events, the first item says: except with the written permission of the authority, person must not conduct an event in a public open space.

395
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:56,710
O K，好嘛，即係如如果係噉嘅情況就可以咯。係啦，即係啲突發嘅或者一啲好細微嘅嘢。O K，因因為頭先啊，因為頭先我理解咧，就係你將嗰個口頭授權畀咗嗰個主辦活動嘅團體，噉我就覺得噉就唔掂啦。

396
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:50,150
啊，即係我主席啊，聽阿阿柏志高先生咁講，即係佢哋未必會誒誒再寫個條條例啦。即係呢度第三同埋第四嗰度，誒其實第四我都有問題嘅，幫我解決咗第三先。咁如果管理局佢誒唔肯誒誒去寫得細緻啲，咁可能我會提出修訂嘅講。

397
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:23,280
誒主席，我最誒大關注咧就口頭嗰度啫，因為咧頭先誒西九管理局代表咧就話，如果有一啲活動係誒批准咗有啲團體去誒誒做嘢啦，咁噉就可能會口頭畀一個授權畀佢。

398
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:43,290
佢哋噉，我覺得你你批咗嗰個團體去辦嗰個活動，其實係可以好清晰喺書面嗰度寫曬㗎啦嘛，即係各樣點樣喺園區裏邊去誒執行。咁點解要用口頭咧？因為及口又口同鼻拗啊，咁即係滑啫嘛。佢話滑啫嘛，咁即係可以包括咯。即係哦，我我就想。

399
01:04:43,290 --> 01:05:03,300
排除啊，Mr. Chairman, perhaps I can I can make it clear what this is about. Of course, if an event is a formal event, you need to be able to give that in writing, and that's our intention. But there are many many interactions on a daily basis where someone who's in the park wants to play flying the kite or wants to.

400
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:23,310
retrieve a kite from a tree or something. We don't want people interfering with the trees, but we also have to be able to allow that person to go up the tree. So that's where the oral permission comes in. In other words, it's to deal with the practical, day-to-day administration of the events in the park. Formal events, of course, they'll be given permissions in writing.

401
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,510
none of that's been designed.

402
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,720
好繼續，有有有提問，係啊，黃議員。

403
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,570
所謂呢一個公眾休憩用地啦，係咪咁講？

404
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,690
所以我們説，我們可能要時不時提供新的計劃。

405
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,940
即係嗰啲所謂restricted area，應該就係盡量minimise，即係個原原則係咪噉樣樣咧？

406
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:49,150
並可不時安排發佈一份新的圖則，以取代現有圖則。

407
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:57,650
亦可不時在現有圖則或新的圖則上批註，對其作出嘅任何修訂。

408
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:42,510
O.K.係，照讀每個資料照讀。管理局需安排發布一份劃定所有公眾休憩用地嘅界線嘅圖則。

409
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:24,940
咁如果有，會唔會都係擺埋喺個附例嗰度嘅咧？定係點？嗯，係。No, Mr. Chairman, I I need to point out that the park hasn't been developed yet.

410
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:14,380
誒，主席，我想問下，而家呢一個公眾休憩用地嘅界線圖則係咪已經有喺度啊？定還是係未有喺度？

411
01:07:51,340 --> 01:08:03,790
主席，而家即係而而家係冇圖則嘅，咁但係大概喺所有非建築用地以外嘅其他地區，就應該可以係。

412
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:32,440
如果冇咧，我哋進入第五條啊！請阿張小姐逐字讀出嚟。第五條咧係關於公眾休憩用地嘅界線嘅。咁誒，管理局咧係需安排。你你讀翻一管理局照讀啊！

413
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:45,640
and we we certainly haven't designed half of the open space so we can't provide a plan at this stage but we will have to when we start to apply this to a particular area provide those plans what we do have at the moment is is a plan for the nursery park which is the only space that this would apply to so it's an evolving situation which is

414
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:28,860
即係話嗰個square啊，所有街道啊、誒公園啊，總之所有building以外嘅地區都係公共休憩用地啦，係咪啊？即係我想，我想，我想澄清下，究竟公共休憩用地嘅定義係啲咩？我嗰度講咗㗎啦，重複啦，講界線啦，不如。

415
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:48,870
Just to give you an idea, obviously the park will be covered under park and open space. The squares, Artist Square, Central Square, rooftop areas that have public access will be covered. The lanes and alleys will be covered because they will have public access. But at the moment.

416
01:08:50,790 --> 01:09:10,800
所以，我唔 afraid，我我唔 can physically provide plans for them，但係， it will cover all of the open space within the district in due course。即係話個原則應該就係盡量maximise嗰個所謂公共休憩嘅用地啦，係咪？即係話禁區，即係下一條就講禁區㗎啦。

417
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,090
That's right.

418
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,900
法例嘅第五嘅第二點咧。

419
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,940
過咗之後，佢係立即生效，係咪啊？立即生效嘅。

420
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:21,370
嚟嘅問題啦，應該係事務委員會或者工作小組裏邊，你去同佢討論去爭取嘅問題啦，好嘛？

421
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:41,200
係咪立即生效？Yes, Mr. Chan。啊，咁立即生效咗之後，如果我哋要修訂呢個附例。

422
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:29,060
你對條文上，主席，我想我想問清楚先，呢一個嘅附例，誒過咗之後。

423
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:33,980
We we haven't come on to that, but the intention is at all times to to ensure that we always minimise the restricted areas, so that the maximum public access is provided at all times, for reasons of safety etc.

424
01:12:45,710 --> 01:13:00,760
因為咧，佢而家呢個寫法咧，就係話嗰個管理局可以不時去發布另一份嘅即係圖則嘅，咁即係話其實個權咧就喺誒管理局嗰邊咧，就係話以嗰個嘅界線去到邊一度，咁誒。

425
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:54,430
主席，因為呢個呢條條例咧個授權咧，就係管理局隨時都可以改變嗰個界線。即係我就我有一個擔心就係會唔會整下整下咧？呢條界線就越縮越細，即係原本公眾嘅地方咧就變成咗商業用途，就變咗咧就係禁止。

426
01:09:54,430 --> 01:10:14,440
啲公眾喺嗰度活動，即係我想知嗰個嗰個誕生，即係會去到邊度？呢個唔係法例問題啊，因為呢兩寫得好清楚，佢話佢會不時會誒發布佢而家個界線係嘛？至於你個界線覺得佢係用咗做誒商業用途啊，或者其他用途咧，應該留翻喺事務委員會。

427
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:34,450
傾咯，或者小組傾咯，工工作小組傾咯，就唔係嗰個法例。我諗我哋研究翻嗰個條文，你係咪覺得有乜嘢唔清楚？主席，因為而家呢度嗰個授權制管理局，佢隨時可以改嗰個界線。咁因為未許好曬啊嘛，即係我反而覺得佢應該有一個最大嘅界線，即係將來最因為法例。

428
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:54,460
講咗邊個叫西九嘅嘅文化區幾大個，但係而家有啲可能畀人用緊，或者未未未發展好。你可以話佢而家管係嘅界線，噉佢不時會發布佢，所以呢度都會話發布佢。最後嘅時候咧就唔能夠大過遠，即係最粗係講個大係最最大個地方嘅啫。但係佢而家嘅時候佢會。

429
01:10:54,460 --> 01:11:14,470
唔同嘅時段，佢有接收唔同嘅嘅地方可以做佢唔同嘅嘢，做好咗佢就咪管理咯。唔做好嗰啲嘅時候，喺佢嘅地方佢咪可能變為禁區，唔畀人入咯。因為可能工地又或者剩佢自己嘅工地係嘛。咁呢啲我覺得就由翻佢去發布咯，係嘛？呢個即係你你所擔心嗰啲嘢咧，就應該唔係法。

430
01:11:41,860 --> 01:12:01,870
就係要翻翻嚟事務委員會啊！係唔係咁？嗰都又有一個草案委員會再修訂啊！而家唔係唔需要修訂㗎。而家你畀權佢去劃一劃嗰個界線啊嘛，因為而家個界線係變緊㗎嘛，分好多face㗎嘛。即係話，如果將來我哋對於嗰個所謂界線，因為嗰個界線跟住就係第二點講嗰度啦，即係。

431
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:21,890
佢哋可以誒限制公眾喺任何時間唔可以入邊一啲區域。咁如果到時有爭議，就喺事務委會嗰度討論。你係咪咁講啊？係啊，因為佢譬如你而家ampers未起好嘅時候，佢劃咗佢嗰度係禁區，唔畀人入嘅。噉你你你你覺得有得入嘅，你咪事務委員會爭議咯。呢個唔係法例問題啊嘛。

432
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:41,900
誒唔係呢個，我想法誒，我想請啊，我哋嘅法律顧問喺邊度啊？喺度，喺度。誒，我想知如果過咗第五嘅一二噉樣啦嚇，噉我哋喺事務委員會，如果對於嗰個所劃定嘅界線有爭議嘅時候，事務委員會有冇權挑戰呢一個？呢個唔係法律。

433
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,610
係嘛？

434
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:29,460
O.K.第六條咧。

435
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,160
第五。

436
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:24,190
如果冇意見咧，我哋當埋第二啦，好嘛？

437
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:34,650
一第六第六條係一般入場等。

438
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:20,250
對於一二條呢個第五嘅一二，大家仲係冇咩意見。

439
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:42,170
凡管理局以書面發出，或獲授權人士給予的指示。

440
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:11,060
第四，根據本條擬備的圖則，須存放在管理局的辦事處。

441
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:27,680
管理局的辦事處及其網站以及公園行政辦公室均需備有根據本條已備的圖則的文本，以供公眾查閲。

442
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:57,160
是為確保有關公眾休憩用地，包括任何限制區域或封閉區域的公共安全或秩序，任何人需遵從所有該等指示。

443
01:14:46,570 --> 01:15:01,500
好，第三，第三，在第二款中提述的圖則內，須劃定和明確地標示限制區域，以顯示進入該等區域是被限制的。

444
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:14,320
講又好，你拎翻嚟相關嘅委員會講又好，呢個係係係係行政上啊，即係工作上嘅嘢啫嘛，唔係法例上嘅嘢啊嘛。即係我我覺得已經係好清晰啦。誒，即係誒，我哋法律顧問已經話畀你聽㗎喎。

445
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:38,190
唔係係，即係如果睇翻個條文本身咧，就唔係喺呢一度講嘅，因為佢已經有個權可以畀佢去。係咯，咁呢個咪同頭先主席講嗰個話，第日翻事務委員會傾，唔係法律問題，咁其實冇得傾㗎嘛，你已經受咗權，佢畫佢點畫得㗎嘛，係咪噉啊？

446
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:21,680
我相信呢一個其實係即係話，如果佢係嗰個圖質嘅話，咁可以喺嗰個嘅委員會再去傾嘅。因為如果呢度嘅寫法就係話，佢管理局係授權佢去不時發布一份圖質，咁個界線都由佢定嘅。咁但係就似乎如果你想話你要挑戰佢嗰個嘅界線咧，就誒唔。

447
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:58,480
喂！依個係一個即係你工作上嘅嘢啊嘛，係咪啊？你而家你ampus未舉個例，ampus未起好，佢劃咗嗰度係禁區或者唔畀你入，咁依啲係工作上嘅嘢，唔係法例上嘅嘢啊嘛。法例係只不過話叫佢去劃界，不時去劃界，將條界覺得你滿唔滿意咧？你你親自同佢。

448
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:45,300
誒第二第二款咧，就係誒管理局可不時安排發佈另一份圖則，或定在第一款描述嘅界線內的界線內的任何區域，以限制公眾在任何時間均不得進入該區域。

449
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,350
第二款。

450
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,530
第七條又冇意見。

451
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,550
District is built out.

452
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,520
限制區域。

453
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,960
如果冇咧，就第七。

454
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,980
一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

455
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:58,640
第二款，任何人違反第一款，即屬犯罪。

456
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:05,520
如果我我佔領呢個地盤，噉我係咪犯第七啦？噉樣。

457
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:20,440
或指令任何人立即離開公眾休憩用地或其任何部分的權力。

458
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:52,990
一任何人未獲准許，不得進入或留在或企圖進入或留在限制區域。

459
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:58,710
仲冇其他題目？噉你就應該所有都係限制區域咯，即係你係嘛？即係呢條法例如果生效之後，你有就一幅草圖，就係所有都限制區域噉嘅。會嘅，會嘅，最初係。

460
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:12,590
管理局或獲授權人士根據第一款的權力，包括拒絕任何人進入公眾休憩用地或其任何部分的權力。

461
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:36,280
此等權力只有在管理局或獲授權人士合理地相信，為確保公共安全或秩序而有必要時，方可行使。有冇意見？第六條一頁。

462
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:25,220
係，我想問咧，頭先係咪話而家未有嗰個圖則出現啊？但係如果呢個法例生效嘅時候，你要誒fulfill第五括弧四括弧五，你係咪要有一個圖則放咗喺你你嘅辦公室同埋網上供人查閲啊？就算你日日改都係係日日改。

463
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:45,230
個問題呀，係Mr張。Mr Chairman, as I said, the only plan we have is the nursery park plan because this would only apply to the nursery park at this stage. None of the rest of the district is ready for public access, so that that plan is is already available. But the general plan, which applies the whole district, is something that, as the chairman said, we'll have to build out as the

464
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:25,920
誒好誒，That's a different matter。OK，誒，法律顧問有提問，係多多謝主席。咁喺第七條嘅第二款嗰度咧，就話任何人咧違反第一款咧，即屬犯罪。咁一經定罪咧，可處第一級罰款。呢個管理局咧，會否咧就係話考慮加上咧，就話如冇合理辯解啊？因

465
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,010
所以。

466
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,500
嗯。

467
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,750
OK，誒。

468
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:41,030
如果冇咧，我就過咗依條啦，好嘛？第八條。

469
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:44,810
第八條係關於封閉區域。

470
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:38,170
依兩依兩條仲有冇提意見啊？陳議員或者其他議員。

471
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:10,890
鄰接該區域或建築物的顯眼處展示告示。

472
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:29,630
Mr. Chairman, we we'll have a look at that。好嘛，研究下啦，可能佢畀狗追咁追咗入去，咁都冇辦法㗎喎嚇。

473
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:53,670
因因為喺其後有幾多係相關嘅條文底下都有呢一種噉樣嘅即係寫法，咁呢個我諗係都值得管理局咧去即係考慮嘅嚇。

474
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:05,060
即係我，我覺得需要咯。你限制區域好多啊嘛！你唔係買嗰場飛去睇嗰場，係嗰個人入錯戲院、入錯個嗰個噉，好似我哋入入錯房噉，你就犯罪，咪好大劑。

475
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:20,780
Mr. Chairman, this does not apply to the indoor areas. This only applies to the open space.一樣嘅啫，你劃咗個區唔畀人入，佢入咗個你個地盤，你咪叫佢走咯，係嘛？你即刻可以告佢犯罪。噉佢可能迷路啊嘛。

476
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:42,550
因為呢一度咧就冇講嘅，就係話如果係即係違反咗第一款咧，就已經係犯罪㗎啦。咁即係會唔會都考慮翻？就話如果有合理辯解嘅話咧，咁其實就唔屬於咧，就係話佢即係誒誒呢一個嘅係犯咗呢個罪嚇。多謝主席。可唔可以？

477
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:20,010
新㗎，唔係唔係講乜嘢，即係個法官都判佢係合理㗎嘛。咁所以即係法律顧問嗰個意見好好啊，加咗呢個落去，對嗰個誒公園使用者嗰個即係保障係大啲咯。即係今日柏志高先生你唔會亂告人啫，第二日唔知邊個錯㗎嘛，係嘛？係啊，可能你自己行錯㗎喎。

478
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:41,670
again，Mr. Chairman，this is this is not an absolute requirement. We we would obviously have regard to the circumstances before we consider any form of prosecution。但係我哋誒即係法律顧問提嗰個意見，我作為主席我都覺得，或者作為一個議員我都覺得係好好都好啱，好合理咯。係啊，何秀蘭。

479
01:19:42,280 --> 01:20:02,290
誒，我我覺得咧，即係擺埋個合理辯解落去咧，其實好多其他法例都係噉嘅，即係而而家噉樣寫法，即係連合理辯解呢個都冇咧，就變咗西九嗰個管理管理局呢個權力真係勁大啊！咁同埋，就算有合理辯解，喂嗰個人都要有合理辯解先甩得。

480
01:20:45,320 --> 01:21:05,330
管理局或獲授權人士可臨時關閉公眾休憩用地的任何部分，或在公眾休憩用地內的任何建築物不開放予公眾使用。方式是在該封閉區域或建築物內，或在。

481
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:16,590
OK。

482
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:49,410
OK。

483
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,120
第四款。

484
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,940
如果冇，我諗誒誒。

485
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,740
入口或出口的權力。

486
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,630
噉啊，睇下你哋如果一一拼去討論。

487
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:39,980
佢依個第八條，大家仲有冇其他意見？除咗頭先我講嗰個。

488
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,630
第九，第九家居動物一。

489
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,150
所有管理局都會願意翻去再睇睇傢俱噉嘅降跌循來。

490
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:31,380
OK，我諗第四款都係頭先嘅意見咧，可唔可以有個合理辯解咧？係咪加埋落去？

491
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:14,670
但通過由管理局指定為公眾使用的出入口則除外。

492
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:25,920
任何人違反第三款，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

493
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:24,090
第二款，管理局或獲授權人士根據第一款封閉該區域，包括建築物的權力。

494
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:09,700
管理局可不時藉在公眾休憩用地的任何部分展示的告示，禁止任何人攜帶某些種類的家居動物進入公眾休憩用地。

495
01:21:50,550 --> 01:22:07,550
第三款，任何人不得進入或離開根據第一款關閉、不開放與公眾使用的公眾休憩用地的任何部分，或在公眾休憩用地內的任何建築物。

496
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:44,380
包括在有合理需要時，為確保公共安全或秩序，利便在封閉區域內的修理或維修工程，或為舉行活動，封閉在公眾休憩用地內的封閉區域或建築物的任何入。

497
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,250
第二。

498
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,000
誒寵物。

499
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,570
第三。

500
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:43,380
誒誒。

501
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,300
物受到管束。

502
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:18,580
會唔會考慮你喺東湧吊車富麗同埋遊樂場嗰度咧，就改翻即係？嗰啲我哋，我哋，我我哋可以。

503
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:20,580
任何人不得攜帶根據第一款禁止的任何種類的家居動物進入公眾休憩用地。

504
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:09,840
即係外地真係有人養，我唔知香港有冇人養啦。咁喺呢度你可唔可以講一講？你考慮呢條條文嘅時候咧，家居動物係包邊啲唔包邊啲咧？同埋你喺嗰個。

505
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:57,580
即係，比如你第三段裏邊講嗰啲雞鴨鵝啊嗰啲，你當唔當咧？因為嗰陣時殺雞令咧，都都有啲人話雞係寵物嚟㗎嘛，係嘛？嚇，咁即係係啦，有有啲細細只嘅豬仔咧。

506
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:41,810
之間即係點樣做嗰個取捨嚇？噉我我想管理局咧喺呢度即係再講多次咧，即係落記錄都要㗎啦嚇。你心目中嘅家居動物係乜嘢咧？係咪？

507
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:42,860
任何人不得攜帶家居動物進入公眾休憩用地，除非該動物是時刻被牽領或放在適當的籠或容器內攜帶，或由負責看管該動物的人以其他適當方法使該動。

508
01:23:45,760 --> 01:24:05,770
係咪呢啲誒？我諗呢度停一停咧，好嘛？阿何秀蘭誒，主席誒，我就想翻翻去咧誒，當局覆我哋法律顧問嗰個附件嗰度，因為我哋法律顧問都好好提咗好多問題畀佢，就係文件嘅誒c b二一二六三誒括弧零五嗰份咁喺誒。

509
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:26,010
第一即係第一頁咧，就已經講咗家居動物呢度㗎啦。咁當然咧，就文件講翻咧呢個家居動物呢個詞咧，就都係回應我哋誒誒一五年三月嗰陣時提出嚟嘅意見嘅，即係喺呢個誒加速誒家居動物。

510
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:30,510
即係誒九會一嗰度就話誒，你會喺嗰個誒公眾休憩地方就用個展示牌，話你禁止攜帶某些種類嘅家居動物入去。咁邊啲你心目中而家係准入，邊啲又唔准入咧？係拎住龍雀噉，即係喺個即係你後邊嗰度會有。

511
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:50,520
講啦，咁拎住籠咗，噉我我誒誒誒想象之係一定準入啦。但係我唔喺度講清楚啲咧，同埋喺誒佢覆我哋法律顧問第四段嗰度咧，都講咗誒寵物同埋動物呢兩個字咧，喺呢個遊樂場地規例同埋東湧吊車。

512
01:25:50,520 --> 01:26:10,530
福利嗰度咧係誒，佢哋就用寵物嘅呢度就經過考慮用動物。噉我唔知有冇政府官員喺度，好似好似冇啊？有有民政事務局嚇噉。如果呢度，如果我哋議會覺得用家居動物係一個好啲嘅詞，咁民政事務局。

513
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,570
Okay.

514
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,710
prohibit birds.

515
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,330
誒，阿黃碧雲。

516
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:41,410
唔，唔使啦，得得。

517
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:32,960
誒，主席，我想問九嘅一嗰度講咧就。

518
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:19,850
即係咪已經係噉樣樣咧？Mr. Chairman, no. As I said, our approach is very much everything's acceptable.

519
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:48,500
Mr. Chairman, perhaps I can answer in a general sense. What we're saying here is that.

520
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:54,770
咁咁即係點咧？即係我哋通過一條法例，其實誒界線唔知噉，你話未起好噉，我哋唔講啦。咁動物。

521
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:46,060
誒可以禁止任何人攜帶某啲種類嘅家居動物進入公眾休憩用地，但係乜嘢叫做某啲得、某啲唔得？呢度係完全又唔知係乜嘢。

522
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:24,230
例咧，去諗住係一個比較寬鬆嘅處理，噉佢係一條條文去處理嘅。但係，譬如喺遊樂場地規例裏面咧，佢除咗即係寵物之外，亦都有其他條文，譬如講羊啊、講貓狗啊噉樣。咁所以即係誒都要考慮翻成個規管嘅制度先可以再作考慮嘅。

523
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:46,790
puts the onus on the owner, the controller, to make sure that they don't allow that animal to create a nuisance, a danger or annoyance to other people. The whole logic is totally different to LCSD. We don't want to prohibit unless we absolutely have to. We actually want to welcome.

524
01:28:55,660 --> 01:29:12,900
即係我哋都大概知道有咩物種㗎啦，除非有啲新嘅突然間DNA爆出啲新嘢。即係究竟呢度係咪其實西九管理局已經大致上有個list，有個list邊啲係可以acceptable，邊啲唔係set唔唔唔可以接受，邊啲可以接受？

525
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:30,850
to be consistent with the general situation. That's why two allows us to prohibit, but generally we want to allow people the flexibility to bring their domestic animals in. It's not for us to question whether a pig is a domestic animal as long as it's under control. So that's the logic of this, and that's why four.

526
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:38,870
唔係呢個範圍啦，我哋覺得用使需唔需要用翻寵物或者呢啲樣嘢，或者點解用家居動物？唔係後邊嗰啲係consequential amendment啫，即係民政事務局即係翻去躲一躲得啦。但係今日喺呢度，我相信就即係要講翻誒家畜啦、受飼養動物啦、家居動物啦、寵物啦噉。好啊。好啊。

527
01:26:50,630 --> 01:27:10,640
We generally accept domestic animals. We don't really mind if it's a bird or a cat or a dog or a hamster or a guinea pig. It's got to be under control. That's the key issue. That's the key issue. And that's why we've written it this way. We may have to prohibit, for example, if bird flu comes up again, then clearly we would have to.

528
01:27:48,680 --> 01:28:08,690
O.K.，好嘅，得嚇。噉，民政事務局代表講，係簡單啲答啦。哦，好。誒，多謝何秀蘭議員嘅提問。誒，我哋將個意見帶翻去畀相關嘅同事考慮。不過，即係誒，我哋都要指出咧，其實相關嘅條例咧，同呢一條條例本身個機制都有啲唔同嘅。因為呢個誒西九管理局嘅副。

529
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:40,640
係。

530
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,230
誒。

531
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:18,020
即係我我想知道你哋將會點樣去執行呢個權力啊！

532
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:01,800
即喺個community裏邊，真係有人係會喜好。

533
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:23,640
again, Mr. Chairman, the the logic of this is that

534
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:28,720
會處理咁咁咧，即係其實公共衞生嗰度比較有一個清楚嘅。

535
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:12,230
and I believe that the the principle of people being aware before they even come to a park of the nature of the park is the best way to control this.

536
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:50,310
所以它係那種 sort of approach，係一個非常 different approach， to  what is traditionally applied in Hong Kong。 我們嘗試去接受， 但係 people 有唔同。

537
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:55,910
即係一定會係噉樣，有啲人好中意蛇或者啲爬蟲類，有啲人見到就好驚打冷震。咁嗰個你點樣處理呢一個？

538
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:21,620
嗯。O K。陳講完。咁即係話，即係任何人帶啲咩嘢都入去都得嘅，誒，除非人投訴或者有啲公共衞生嘅理由，噉樣先至會。

539
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:13,370
可以係一個好好衝突嘅一個場面。咁西九管理局你點去取捨咧？係咪有一個人投訴就唔畀啦？定還是有十個人投訴先唔畀咧？

540
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:44,800
想象嚇，即係我哋知道係咩情況，但係如果話有冇人投訴作為一個考慮咧，噉就會出現好多衝突，因為有啲人好中意狗狗，有啲人好怕狗狗。

541
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:40,210
所以如果 people want to bring a snake, as long as it's under control, we're happy. Where we expect to have to introduce the restriction under 91 is where there are maybe a situation in the community which we've had before. Bird flu would be an example. We would not want people to bring birds into a park if bird flu re-emerged.

542
01:29:50,680 --> 01:30:10,690
types of domestic animal that they may wish to bring in, as long as it's under control, we will say yes, unless there's a good reason to say no. So it's a very different approach. And at this stage, there's no particular reason why we should say anything should not be allowed, because as I understand it, there are no restrictions within the community. So it's a very different approach.

543
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:43,930
We want people to know if they come to the park, there may be animals in the park. There may be dogs. There may be cats. There may be birds. We've seen people with hamsters. We've seen people with hedgehogs. We've seen all sorts of people coming to the park. So their expectation is managed even before they come to the park. That's the first principle. Secondly, if there are complaints regard

544
01:31:43,930 --> 01:32:03,940
作為，我們説這裡， danger、nuisance 或 annoyance， 則我們必須要有權力去處理這些情況。這條款會讓我們處理這些情況。但一般來説，我們不是採用這種方法，即是要説你不能帶你的動物進來，只要它在控制之下。所以，再次，這是我們要達到的另一種方法。

545
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,030
陳主任。

546
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,120
O.K.，just a minute.

547
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,770
咁咧，我亦都見過野豬。

548
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,150
非法禁藥係啊！報紙賣個報紙賣過。

549
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:14,250
睇到啲新聞啦，咁都想問喺呢情況下個處理上點啊？唔該。

550
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,680
And that's the best way to to to put the proof of it. Okay, thank you.

551
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:11,240
即係有啲係噉樣嘅，到時係咪個成個壓力都擺翻喺嗰啲誒公園大廈啊嗰啲員工身上咧？

552
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:23,810
誒係，首先我我歡迎誒，即係西九管理局局啊一種開放嘅態度。

553
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:19,510
即係等住個事件事件各樣，先去管理而家街道啲嘢，有時都好多矛盾產生嘅。點樣先能夠呢方面做到更加好啲咧？唔該。

554
01:33:56,420 --> 01:34:04,800
咁但係到時嗱，當我呢個即係好極端嘅，但係而家時嘅社會我都覺得，我諗多少少可能。

555
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:48,950
people not controlling their their dogs, for example, but the ambassadors are trained to deal with those situations, and we've never had a problem that's escalated. So I'm I'm confident that this approach works because we've tested it.

556
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:35,290
Mr. Chairman, in fact, as the members are aware, we've been running the nursery park basically using this logic for something like eleven months now. There have been occasional incidents where we've had

557
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:44,100
咁咧就係誒，但當中誒我諗都要諗下啦，因為到時都有嗰啲員嘅管理員或者嗰啲大肆管理㗎嘛，咁咧就會到時有啲嘢咧，即係就可能誒去到誒都幾得拗撬嘅，例如有啲人而家中意養一啲咩咧，鱷魚仔啊，佢即係。

558
01:32:50,050 --> 01:33:10,060
想講噉，所以我就覺得，即係我首先先歡迎歡迎西九管理局呢個態度係好嘅。但當你要去對啲人去做管理嘅時候咧，係咪去到某啲地方你都要小心處理咧？即係當開放同有啲人，佢認為嗰啲佢可能認為自己掂㗎，但佢就唔理你公眾點睇佢㗎嘛。我哋睇報紙有時監狗有時。

559
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:36,410
That's exactly why we need these particular provisions in the bylaw. But particularly if I draw your attention to nine four, we're putting the onus on the owner. We expect them to abide by the provision that if they bring a domestic animal into this open space.

560
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:56,420
They must not allow it to cause danger, nuisance or annoyance to other people. So that's that provision. It allows us to take action if they if they do contravene that provision, then under subsection nine, then we can deal with that. So we want to welcome them, but we we have to have the power to deal with the problems. And I think the honourable members.

561
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,080
啊！

562
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,240
七。

563
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,430
誒。

564
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,620
第六款。

565
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,470
好，黃碧雲。

566
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,840
O.K. 好，跟住讀落去係嘛？

567
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:23,800
即係佢可以去執行到，即係佢佢都想做咗一個盡責任嘅狗主。

568
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:46,380
及B，需以清水稀釋該動物留在公眾休憩用地的尿液。

569
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:38,210
啲香港係容許，不過要攞牌照，但係冇攞牌照嘅動物，你會唔會容許佢喺西九管理嘅園區裏邊即係存在咧？

570
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:08,890
我我我好似跳得快啲噉去咗第六嗰度嗱誒，我係歡迎歡迎。誒，我諗講翻第一二條好唔好先嚇？如果都都係相關嘅，因為呢個係講緊。

571
01:36:49,300 --> 01:37:00,760
係好啊，第六條，誒呢度六嗰度，我想問下咧，就嗱，當然呢啲係啲狗嘅誒主人咧，應該要做嗰啲功德嚟嘅，即係啲衞生。

572
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:38,400
攜帶家居動物進入公眾休憩用地的人，A需將該容該動物留在公眾休憩用地的任何糞便、移置廢物棄置容器。

573
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:17,920
誒噉，但係咧就配套咧，就我唔知西九管理局有冇安排啲狗公廁，誒喺個公園有足夠嘅地方，同埋收集呢啲狗糞便嘅嗰啲容器，同埋有冇地方畀佢方便攞到水？

574
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:58,370
主席，我相信法律會apply in that case。我唔諗The Bligh laws會be able to overtake the provisions under the ordinances that exist，所以那會be something for the relevant authority to deal with，而我們會of course comply with whatever the ruling is from the relevant authority。

575
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:21,630
第五款，攜帶家居動物進入公眾休憩用地的人，須遵從管理局在公眾休憩用地的任何部分所不時展示的所有關於控制該等動物或該等動物的善後清理的告示。

576
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:29,180
誒西九呢一個管理局，我諗讀到嗰度先嚟做啦，係冇啊？啊一陣再傾啦。O K，好啊，好。第二條仲有冇？一二條又冇提問，冇咧。我都有個問題，譬如話你咁寬鬆咧，如果有啲人帶啲動物，佢係呢啲貧危嘅動物，或者係香港禁止進口嘅動物，或者甚至有啲。

577
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,080
第八款。

578
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:09,880
如果冇咧，繼續計七。

579
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,600
嗰個主席，噉就住咧係第九條咧。

580
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:08,040
跟住再冇提問，第五第六。

581
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,350
即係喺呢啲安排嗰度係點樣樣啊？

582
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:52,520
有幾多呢啲狗公廁咧？有啲寵物公廁咧？

583
01:38:54,470 --> 01:39:00,140
嘅條同埋第九款，需唔需要交翻有合理辯解呢句説話咧？啊！

584
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:54,190
O.K. 整體上第九有冇問題咧？第九誒，即係第九。

585
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:34,330
第七款不適用於攜帶援助動物進入公眾休憩用地的殘疾人士。

586
01:37:53,660 --> 01:38:03,500
嗯， well， we haven't designed the park， so I can't I can't answer that question， but there will be some。我諗呢個唔係法例問題啦，佢要答應提供就OK啦，係嘛？

587
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:47,630
第九，任何人違反第二、三、四、五、六或七款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

588
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:23,690
第七款，在獲授權人士的要求下，任何攜帶家居動物進入公眾休憩用地的人，需將該動物從公眾休憩用地移走。

589
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:39,150
係附例咧，嗰度咧就冇去寫明呢一樣嘢嘅。咁當然第九款亦都一個相同嘅問題咧，就係話誒，就請西九管理局考慮交翻合理辯解呢一個嘅係即係個抗辯嘅嚇，都係主席好嘛？

590
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:48,620
Mr. Chairman, yes. In fact, within the the unleashed area, we do provide water. We do provide bins throughout the park for disposal of faeces, so that that is already provided in the nursery park, and of course will be replicated in the new parks and open spaces as we develop them.

591
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:24,890
第八款咧，我都有一個嘅係誒，即係想請西九管理局咧去考慮嘅，因為呢度講到咧就係話第七款咧不適用於攜帶援助動物進入公眾休憩用地的殘疾人士。咁誒會否咧就考慮即係話呢一個嘅援助即係援助動物咧，係咪要畀佢一個定義咧？因為而家呢一個嘅。

592
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:59,440
Mr. Chairman, this this issue was raised by the legal adviser in writing to us previously, and our response is very clear. We are aware that in different jurisdictions, different types of animal are used as assistance animal. The issue here is there is no definition.

593
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,290
係。

594
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,630
啊，法律顧問有冇意見？

595
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:32,420
你知，它

596
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:26,160
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, we've we've we've studied this in some detail. There are examples of, for example, monkeys using helping people who have no limbs.

597
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:28,860
advertently preventing someone using a particular animal that may be an assistance animal that we don't know about. So that's that's the logic of why we don't have a definition here.

598
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:40,310
即係大家愛護動物政策都應該向前行㗎嘛，係嘛？係。As I said, Mr. Chairman, that's what we intend to do. I take the point. It's the only sensible way forward.

599
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:29,210
係指即係寫落嗰個指引嗰度，然後我哋即係兩年或者某個時間之後，即係去做一個檢討。當然最好就係將呢個即係誒誒指引裏邊寫落嚟嘅定義，即係嗌政府都採納埋添。

600
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:07,800
動物佢就係聲稱係援助動物嘅時候，噉你哋需要佢提供一啲咩核證嘅即係證據，去顯示呢個真係一隻受過訓練嘅援助動物咧？因為呢個其實都係關乎一個即係個法例嘅清晰度啦，嚇，多謝主席。

601
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:16,920
我都係活作動物咯喎，佢拉住我嚟行，我唔使用電。噉你噉你會出現點咧？係嘛？咁噉你你你你你佢咁講，佢話有依只噉嘅動物咧，噉你你你你就係咪畀佢入呢啲誒禁止嘅地區咧？

602
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:26,600
Quite honestly, we can't. There is nothing in Hong Kong that allows us to do that. So how can we define something that the Lord doesn't? What we will do as a way round this is in the guidelines we will provide information on, as you said, the U.S. and the Australian models, but

603
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:19,450
And it would be wrong, I think, for the West Kalim Cultural District to define something where the the government itself hasn't come up with a definition. We're happy to comply with whatever definition the government eventually comes up with. But we believe that this is sufficient for us to be able to administer these bylaws without inadvertently.

604
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:53,920
因為咧，其實呢個嘅即係援助動物assistance animal咧寫得出嚟噉，其實就譬如啊喺澳洲或者美國咧，其實佢哋都有個定義咧係寫咗出嚟嘅。咁問題就係話，如果而家唔寫嘅時候，譬如喺個執行上面，我都想即係請西區管理局可唔可以即係誒提供啲資料？譬如有人帶咗一隻動

605
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:55,580
誒，何所難啊？主席嗱，我我哋係想解決個問題嘅啫。我我明阿柏志高先生嗰個嗰個睇法嘅，即係香港法例裏邊而家未有嘅定義啦。你又唔想行得先個政府噉，但係咧頭先我哋法律顧問咧就想攞個定義，柏志高先生畀我哋嗰個書面文件咧，佢就講。

606
01:41:55,580 --> 01:42:15,590
講即係用一個名單嗰個手法去處理咁名單咧，其實都係弊嘅。噉我建議可唔可以即係你喺指引裏邊都寫埋咧？因為嗱，即係如果你唔想早個特區政府有一個法律嘅定義，但係起碼你可以參考頭先法律顧問話，即係外國嗰啲例。

607
01:42:41,260 --> 01:43:01,270
但但其實都有有啲問題嘅，因為你寫得噉樣嘅情況咧，因為通常我哋而家日常生活咧所講呢啲援助動物都係畀一啲誒盲人啊或者視力有障礙嘅人咧去用多。如果你噉樣寫嘅時候咧，我係一個殘疾人士，噉我坐住個輪椅揾只狗揾只狗嚟拉，又揾只鹿嚟拉噉。

608
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:46,450
There are examples of horses being used to pull chairs. There are many, many different examples around the world. This is the problem. It isn't just dogs for people who are visually impaired. There are many different types of assistance animal, and you know it is so difficult.咁即係你都預咗畀只馬入嚟㗎喎，係嘛？

609
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,510
四。

610
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:00,700
第九條，如果冇咧，我哋第十開始，好嘛？

611
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:09,690
舉行活動，第一。

612
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:51,300
馬嘅我哋，miniature horses have been used. Yeah, yeah.

613
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:57,770
O.K.，仲有冇提問？八九啊，或者整題整條第九行。

614
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:06,570
十誒誒誒陳議員咧係咪第八冇九冇啦？O K，第十畀佢讀咗先啦，好嘛？

615
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:50,640
或B就入場參加某活動而要求換票或其他許可證。

616
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:18,120
B就進入用作活動場地的公眾休憩用地的任何部分。

617
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:17,500
除非獲管理局書面准許，任何人不得在公眾休憩用地舉行活動。

618
01:45:52,910 --> 01:46:00,820
管理局獲授權人士或籌辦人可作出下列任何一項或多於一項事情。

619
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:10,060
A.限制可進入用作活動場地的公眾休憩用地的任何部分的人數。

620
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:28,410
二管理局可一般地或在個別情況下給予任何人，包括籌辦人書面準許。

621
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:43,030
三，除非獲管理局書面準許，籌辦人不得A就某活動而樹設任何建築物、支架、攤位、平台或展品。

622
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:51,580
都係頭先嗰個建議啦，希望喺嗰個指引嗰度寫低，噉就即係一段時間之後誒去做一個檢討咯。我諗都係要寫清楚，有啲嘢都相對清楚一啲係嘛？噉你又話殘疾人士，你情緒唔係幾好又唔算殘疾人士，咁呢啲又排拗嘅，所以你都要寫清楚啲啦嚇。

623
01:43:52,400 --> 01:44:12,410
唔係佢主席啊！佢去到西九之前咧，只馬要真係喺喺馬路度畀佢行先得。唔係佢可能架車車在嗰度放佢落嚟啦。係咯，我喺度停一場。香港而家冇馬路㗎啦，即係有車路嘅啫。噉佢入唔到去。但係即係主席，我我同意阿柏志高先生講咧。

624
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:32,420
其實嗰個援助動物咧，即係唔單止係導盲犬嘅。即係我開頭睇嘅時候咧，我都我都會想話：，喂，噉你不如寫清楚係導盲犬啦。但係即係再睇多啲資料，係我同意，唔單止係導盲犬嘅，即係可能係誒安幫佢安撫情緒啊，或者提醒佢做第啲嘢啊。咁誒，但係即係我。

625
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:34,350
第六。

626
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:05,040
第五。

627
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,030
第七。

628
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:28,010
第八。

任何人在被要求離開用作活動場地的公眾休憩用地的任何部分後，需立即離開。

635
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:07,280
任何人如不符合有關的年齡要求，或不能或不願意根據第五款的要求出示年齡證明，

636
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:26,060
有關獲授權人士或籌辦人，可要求該人離開用作活動場地的公眾休憩用地的該部分。

637
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:53,540
則由有關的獲授權人士或籌辦人所判定的該人的年齡，即為就本附例而言該人的年齡。

638

第九。

642
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:29,400
係咪真係要攞牌畀你批准咁先得咧？

643
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,500
嗰啲咁嚇，咁呢度即係請管理局下次答我啊。好啊，黃碧雲。

644
01:49:55,870 --> 01:50:00,830
佢冇你事前嘅批准嘅，唔該。誒，唔使答住。啊，你唔使答，下次。

645
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:44,060
健身啊嘛，咁咁呢啲係咪又又變咗會犯法咧？無端端。

646
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:38,670
即係咩叫活動咧？即係我唔知大家有冇去過啲公園晨操睇過，一定係一堆堆人已經喺度活動緊㗎啦，做緊體育活動啊嘛～

647
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:50,350
任何人違反第一、三或八款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

648
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:15,220
O.K.，我諗第九條咧，因為時間嘅關係咧，即係我哋今日嘅會議就結束啦。噉樣咧，好唔好下次先至問問題咧？啊！

649
01:48:50,920 --> 01:49:04,520
十，在本條中，籌辦人（organiser）就某活動而言，指已獲管理局給予書面準許舉行該活動的人。

650
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:35,860
嚟準備好唔好啊，主席啊，或者如果有係啦，問問題你問多個問題，下次準備好。我我第九誒對唔住，第先先畀陳婉嫻先。陳婉嫻，你會唔會講咗你個問題，不過唔答你嘅？我講問題咧，其實呢條都幾多問題想問。我你講咗啲問題，等我一個問題啫。陳婉嫻先，你又第一條就又呢條好緊要啊！一齣問題咧就。

651
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:55,870
會罰款嘅，我就想問：，除非獲管理局書面準許任何人不得在公眾休憩用地舉行活動，嗱呢個你規定嘅。不過我就想講咧，例如有啲表演場地啦嚇，突然間有個主流嘅誒活動喺處好開心，另外有啲人本身要做翻啲即係佢即興嘅嘢啊，如果類似呢啲人又點去處理咧？

652
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:21,120
係誒問曬問題先啦，阿誒何秀蘭誒主席誒兩部分嘅問題，第一咧就係呢條法例同即係呢個附例呢度咧，同呢個公眾娛樂場所條例嗰個關係係點？因為公眾娛樂場所條例咧，即係亦都有好多限制，要攞好多申請，咪同唔同部門嚇噉。

653
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:41,130
即係呢度，呢度西九管理局喺自己嗰度，使唔使攞其他牌照嗰啲嘢？係啦嚇，即係你係咪要滿足咗嗰邊啊，再滿足埋呢邊啊？定係呢度係即係你一次過西九管理局準你做咧，你就乜都做得曬啦。咁諸如此類，第一啦，第二咧就係呢個活動同公眾活動有乜嘢分別咧？

654
01:50:41,130 --> 01:51:01,140
即係我就好擔心咧。你有一啲一個兩個人唔係好滋擾嘅嘅行為，你都跌咗入去活動呢個範圍，噉啊乜都要攞牌噉啊死啦。但係如果你講明係公眾活動，噉我哋即係知道哦，即係你係會誒表演啊、各樣啊，或者誒誒呢個美誒誒美酒佳餚啊嗰～

655
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:25,790
誒，我我都覺得咧，呢度對於所有活動咧，真係好大範圍嘅嘢嘅喎。即係譬如一噉，如果朝頭早嗰度你有個公園喺度，就肯定好多住喺附近嘅人過嚟晨運啦。咁啲人圍埋一齊跳跳下舞、打下太極拳噉，噉。

656
01:51:44,410 --> 01:52:04,420
O.K.啊，陳主係啦，我都係想誒，世界管理局澄清或者諗多少少活動嘅定義啦。譬如有個人去派嘢，扭波派畀啲細路仔，佢即係隨心去做，唔係又唔係賣，唔係牟利。母親節你去派花咁嚇喺嗰度，咁算唔算係活動咧？派貼紙咁又譬如誒。

657
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:41,800
嘅出席，多謝。

658
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:18,500
噉我諗呢啲活動啊，誒，我諗下次答啦，好嘛？再冇其他提問啦。

659
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:13,020
有人去做一啲街頭嘅問卷調查噉樣，咁嗰啲算唔算係活動咧？即係會唔會受呢個第十條所規管咧？咁？

660
01:52:20,690 --> 01:52:40,700
如果冇咧，噉我哋就會後咧就會同秘書處，秘書處就會同呢個西九管理局同埋誒政府嗰邊咧，大家誒聯絡咧，就定再定下一次嘅會議日期。咁大家提嘅問題都好好。噉我哋下一次由第十條嗰度再搭翻開始啦，好嗎？多謝大家。
