1
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,130
嗱。

2
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
王碧雲議員。

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,570
立法會主席。

4
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,550
請各位同事翻回座位。

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,220
我話陳志全議員，要求點算法定人數？好嘅。

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,790
陳偉業議員而家係開緊會嘅，請你縮靜同埋坐低好嘛？

7
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,770
誒，主席，我發言支持由郭榮亨議員提出。

8
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:00,560
咁亦都係喺法案委員會得到支持，而家咧係由陳健林議員以法案委員會主席。

9
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,510
哋喺網絡上邊表達自由或者二次創作所帶嚟嘅影響同埋傷害嘅。

10
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:45,180
自由市場經濟係非常之重要，咁亦都係立約法，亦都係合約法嘅一個重要基石嚟嘅。

11
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:09,510
係提出嘅一項全體委員會審議階段嘅修正案，噉係關於限制合約零價性嘅。

12
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:56,680
嗱，但係我想指出咧，就係立約嘅自由亦都唔係絕對嘅，即係話合約嘅雙方中意點樣定都得，係唔需要理會其他嘅法律。

13
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,890
約束。

14
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
又或者合約。

15
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,020
作為消費者。

16
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,790
咁呢啲嘅合約啊、合同啊，係一種嘅法律上邊。

17
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,720
租屋嚇，即係租客同埋業主之間嘅合約啦。

18
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:51,240
釐定嘅關係，即係當事人通過協議，係替做法律上邊嘅權利同埋義務。

19
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:57,460
網民同網絡提供嘅公司之間嗰個嘅議價嘅能力。

20
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:15,650
當我哋去購買一啲服務或者產品嘅時候咧，好多情況咧都會受到商户所訂立嘅嗰啲條款。

21
00:15:52,350 --> 00:16:05,170
咁雖然係噉樣樣啊，合約係需要兩位或者兩位以上嘅當事人達成，但喺日常生活裏邊咧，我相信大家都亦都好明白，包括在座嘅政府官員。

22
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:32,370
最近我都簽咗幾份合約，就關於咧我辦事處咧係要係誒續訂嗰啲上網嘅誒同電信公司誒簽嘅合約係要續約嚇上網嘅服務或者電話線啊等等。

23
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:13,680
如果人人都可以話啊，我哋喺合約裏邊雙方中意點都得咧，咁其實即係奴隸制度都可以變成係一個有效嘅合約嘅，噉就會繞過曬現有嘅法律框架。嗱喺合同法中嘅所謂合同contract。

24
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:49,060
咁所以咧，好多時候喺簽訂呢啲噉嘅合約嘅過程裏邊，消費者同埋服務提供者其實唔係喺一個同等嘅、對等嘅、平等嘅關係上邊去協商嗰個合約嘅內容。咁消費者又或者我哋而家講緊嘅網絡。

25
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:31,980
即係你籤就籤，唔籤就唔籤，唔籤你就得唔到呢一個嘅誒公司提供嘅服務。咁所以好多時候咧，消費者咧就係變咗，其實係冇得選擇。你嘅選擇只係幫襯呢家定係嗰家嘅啫。啊，咁但係家家都係噉樣做嘅，都係要你籤嘅。

26
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:29,980
咁呢項修訂咧，目的咧就係確保草案新增嘅法定豁免嗰六項係唔會因為網民因為使用網上服務而簽訂合約嘅時候咧，係因此而受到約束，係冇辦法行使佢哋嗰個嘅權利嘅。噉係令到相關。

27
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:49,990
個六項嘅豁免咧變相失效，咁即係話咧法例對網民嘅保障有可能因為合約係具有凌駕性而冇辦法落實佢哋喺呢一方面誒豁免嘅權利，噉係令到網民咧係非常之擔心通過咗呢條版權修訂條例咧對佢。

28
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:17,120
嗱，政府嘅講法咧就係誒喺商務及經濟發展局局長蘇錦良喺一月二十一號喺立法會動議恢復二讀辯論《二零一四年版權修訂條例草案》發言嘅時候咧，就咁講，就話政府咧經小心考慮之後咧，認為本

29
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:37,130
本條例草案係唔能夠接受啊！郭榮亨議員提出嘅呢一個修正案嘅噉，我係非常之遺憾，即係局長呢一個説法嗱。不論喺法案委員會階段，亦或係局長喺恢復二讀辯論時候嘅發言啦，都多次指出立約自由對香港嘅。

30
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:35,650
係一個具有法律約束力嘅協議，由兩位或者多位當事人咧係有共識而達成嘅。日常生活裏邊嘅例子咧，有好多嘅啊，呢啲噉樣嘅合約、契約、合同，包括咗一啲買賣嘅合約啦、保險嘅合約啦、一啲誒租。

31
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,270
黃碧雲議員。

32
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,680
嗱，版權持有人。

33
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,250
當然，佢嘅着眼點就係利潤。

34
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,940
而要負上民事法律責任嘅。

35
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,540
誒，陳宇駒議員，請你唔好講電話，翻返座位。

36
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,450
點樣去確保網民嗰個言論同埋創作自由，唔會因為新訂立嘅？

37
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,820
我主席，我而家係解釋緊畀你聽呢度嘅關係，因為我哋而家係講緊contract over why嘛。

38
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:41,590
豁免係冇辦法行使啊嘛，咁所以咧，佢最後可能係令到網民都會因為違反咗呢一份合約。

39
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:35,640
提醒你，我哋係講緊版權法。唔啊，主席，我而家一路都係講緊呢一個嘅修訂嘅。因為版權法，網絡商同消費者係冇一個版權嘅啊制約嘅，但係所以我希望你翻返嚟喺個版權法嗰度講講啊呢個合約嘅問題。

40
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:52,660
咁但係咧，簽嘅時候一定係跟住即係一啲啲字寫得密密麻麻、細細只嘅一份噉樣嘅合約嘅要求條款係要簽嘅。如果唔係，你根本上咧都攞唔到嗰個上網嘅服務或者嗰條嘅電話線嚟使用。咁好多時候咧，消費者會受呢啲商户定立。

41
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:12,670
嘅條款約束，但係當中嘅條款同埋條件咧，其實好多時候就唔會話同你簽合約嘅時候同你商量下，你同唔同意啊？會唔會當中有邊條可以刪去？你唔同意嘅係獲得豁免啊？又或者咧，你可唔可以將新嘅你嘅意見寫落去嗰啲合約嗰度啊？其實都唔容許消費者有呢種選擇。

42
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:17,830
喺合約嘅釐定上邊，其實根本上咧就唔係一個平等嘅關係，可以話咧係十分之懸殊嘅。嗱，作為立法者咧，我哋咁多位立法會議員而家坐喺度，嗱，我哋必須要站喺保障消費者權益嗰個角度去思考呢一條嘅版權修訂條例嘅。

43
00:18:45,100 --> 00:19:05,110
而家我咪講緊contract呢樣嘢咯，合約呢樣嘢咯，就係講緊合約嘅雙方係消費者冇嗰個議價能力咯。嗱，我哋必須要站喺保障消費者嘅權益嗰度咧去思考呢個問題。嗱，今次版權法嘅即係從今次版權法嘅。

44
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:25,120
修定啊！呢一個角度嚟睇啦，我哋當然咧係一方面要保護嗰個版權人、原有版權人嘅嗰個嘅權益，但係亦都要考慮究竟有冇為網民係提供足夠保障啊嘛。而家我哋一路都係講緊呢樣嘢啫嚇，即係講咗拉布拉咗咁耐，都係講緊呢一樣嘢。

45
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:52,740
呢一個嘅條例，佢哋嗰個傳播權利咧係誒受到削弱，即係而家草案所提議嘅係為戲仿啦、諷刺啦、營造滑稽或者模仿、評論時事同埋引用目的係提供公平處理嘅豁免。咁呢度係。

46
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:12,750
係有六項嘅豁免，噉我哋係明白嘅，亦都係比原先嗰條例係進步咗嘅。呢個我哋係冇質疑過，亦都好清楚嘅。個問題就係話，究竟呢六項嘅豁免，因為呢條修訂條例通過之後，係咪就真係行使到呢啲嘅權利咧？咁噉，我哋係有質疑嘅。

47
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,390
係。

48
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,860
啊！

49
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,770
王碧雲議員。

50
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,830
簽訂合約。

51
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,270
有幾多？即係已經係超過八十萬啦。

52
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:08,990
係要求YouTube嘅約束用户喺佢嘅平台上邊可以分享作品嘅性質，包括現時條例下所賦予嘅版權豁免。

53
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:40,900
講到六樣豁免都應該好夠好足夠保障到大家，但係事實上咧就變成空中樓閣，睇得到，但係最後咧係真係用唔到，保障唔到佢哋嘅。咁所以喺噉樣嘅。

54
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:32,760
因為咧，我哋係好擔心會唔會啊，係喺誒網絡公司提供呢啲服務嘅時候，要同消費者網民簽訂合約嘅時候，佢會唔會係因為簽訂喺合同裏邊列出一啲嘅細節，而呢啲嘅細節咧，係令到原先法例裏邊所講嘅呢六項。

55
00:20:49,620 --> 00:21:09,630
將利潤最大化嗱，當然佢係會用盡一切嘅辦法，係會為佢嘅版權作品咧爭取最大嘅商業利益嘅。咁所以版權持有人絕對係有有因啦，去訂立合約。陳志全議有議員喺後邊講電話，大主席話過唔準嘅，好啊。

56
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:52,090
嗱，主席，所以版權持有人咧，絕對係有有因咧去訂立合約。嗱，正所謂咧，魔鬼在細節中噉，所以網上嘅使用條款之中咧，一般都係咧寫到密密麻麻，好細只，係又唔顯眼，又十分冗長。好多時候消費者未必睇得清楚，就已經即係畀。

57
00:21:52,090 --> 00:22:12,100
agent咧，即係sales叫你快啲簽啦咁噉。版權持有人有可能咧，會係喺使用條款當中咧設下條款，限制一啲本來法律容許嘅二次創作嘅行為嘅。又譬如網民經常喺網站發表改圖啊，發

58
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:32,110
翻唱啊，等等呢啲嘅作品，藉以表達佢對社會某一件事嘅關注，咁都有可能咧誤墮法網。嗱，呢類具諷刺時弊嘅作品咧，往往會吸引大量網民咧，佢係轉載、瀏覽、like、share，所以咧一個網絡創作團體，譬如咧。

59
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:52,120
誒學舌鳥為例啊，嚇舉例啊，佢哋咧係將劉德華嘅歌曲《獨自去偷歡》咧係改編而成為咧日日去救護，咁可能唔知大家有冇聽過，但係就肯定即係喺網上邊係非常之受歡迎。咁呢個二次創作咧，就係要表達市民。

60
00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:12,130
喺佔領區被警方咧係誒清場之後，佢哋繼續咧以所謂購物或者係購物嘅形式去示威。呢個係一個好創好創新嘅佢哋誒發明嘅一個表達，佢哋喺政治上邊嘅不滿嘅一種宣泄，就透過。

61
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:32,140
劉德華嘅原來呢首《獨自去偷歡》咧，係將佢改咗，咁咧要嚟宣泄對於警方清場啊，佢哋所謂持武啊，警方所謂持武，原來亦都會拎支棍嚟打你嘅，咁咧表達佢嗰種不滿。咁呢條影片咧喺YouTube嘅點擊率咧，啊主席，你之前。

62
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,660
嗱，合約零價一詞咧係指版權物嘅持有人。

63
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,170
同使用者之間，佢哋嘅同意啊，嗰個嘅consent。

64
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:55,850
嗱，某啲又或者全部有關版權嘅使用限制咧，都唔執行嘅。

65
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,830
擁有人係按雙方已定嘅條款訂立私人協議，例如透過。

66
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:18,630
咁所以咧，我哋講緊啊，根據呢一個嘅誒定義咧，如果法例容許合約零價。

67
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:38,870
特許授權他人為特定目的嘅使用版權作品，版權擁有人在此。

68
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:28,010
條例草案所畀嘅所謂六項嘅新增豁免，頭先我講過啦，就可以變成形同虛設。

69
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:12,340
澳洲嘅法律改革委員會亦都有類似嘅建議嘅。咁根據澳洲法律改革委員會喺二零一三年十一月。

70
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:38,820
咁呢個二零一三年嘅報告書裏邊提到合約凌格，又或者喺澳洲咧，佢哋有時會用另一個名詞嘅，就叫contracting out。

71
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:10,630
例如，版權物嘅使用者或者會同意，唔會以合理使用（fair use）或者合理處理（fair dealing）係為使用嗰啲版權物嘅理由。

72
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:28,110
出嘅佢哋嘅一個報告書，咁呢個係一百二十二號嘅報告書，英文咧叫做《Copyright and the Digital Economy》，中文咧即係話版權與數碼經濟嘅報告書。

73
00:26:48,300 --> 00:27:05,260
權益係能夠行使嘅話咧，噉我唔明白點解政府同埋建制派嘅議員唔認真考慮下接受法案委員會而家提出嚟嘅，我哋係接受呢一個啊contract override呢一個嘅修訂。

74
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:23,400
嗱，知識產權處曾經就郭榮亨議員有關合約嘅凌駕性嘅事咧，係誒覆個信啊。咁政府喺該份回覆嘅文件裏邊咧，就表示按現行制度，個別使用者可以同版權。

75
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:55,950
嗱，對於YouTube嚟講咧，YouTube係以點擊率嚟賺取廣告收費嘅。而對於版權人嚟講咧，當然佢哋嘅着眼點就係呢條二次創作嘅影片帶嚟嘅經濟收益。咁所以版權持有人絕對係有有因咧，係想同YouTube。

76
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:29,280
嗱，所以我可以預見，如果今日辯論嘅就版權豁免加入限制合約凌駕性嘅條文，如果得唔到在座各位議員立法會嘅支持咧，法例新增嘅版權豁免咧，其實係形同虛設，即係好似局長。

77
00:24:41,250 --> 00:25:01,260
思考同埋憂慮底下咧，我係支持郭榮亨議員提出咧，就係話我哋要重新思考呢個所謂合約凌價性嘅問題。contract over wide，噉我一講翻contract over wide呢一樣嘢啦。嗱，對於加入限制合約凌價性嘅條文。

78
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,810
properly。

79
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,460
The argument here.

80
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,470
Why should a consumer?

81
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,870
consumers in general.

82
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,480
That's the whole point of.

83
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,250
We're all ordinary consumers here.

84
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,180
consumers are consumers.

85
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,420
Why would we need to be taken to court?

86
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,460
very nicely behaving himself, suddenly become the accused.

87
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,980
I think no one would particularly dispute that statement. The fact is.

88
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:08,160
在《common law》精神，what is not disallowed is allowed。

89
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,930
Mr. Rasmussen said, "Don't you worry, guys. The court would tend to protect."

90
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:26,210
係冇辦法得到呢一方面嘅保障，咁所以主席咧，我係發言支持呢一行修訂。你停止發言，冇辦正業。

91
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:35,730
innocently， but you just might be taken to court for something you thought you didn't do.

92
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:25,910
to explain ourselves for something we thought we did perfectly legally, perfectly.

93
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:40,600
This is a debate, and I feel obliged to speak against what our honourable member Abraham Rasic expressed earlier today.

94
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:48,300
即係話戲仿啊、諷刺啊、挖窪啊、模仿啊、評論時事啊、引用啊，所以咧，即係呢六樣嘢嚇。如果我哋真係局長或者各位議員認為係真係值得，我哋係有呢啲豁免，係令到呢一個嘅精神能夠兑現呢種。

95
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:59,160
誒，在批予特許嘅同時，可能要求使用者承諾不會作出若干允許嘅作為，除非使用者願意繳付雙方均同意嘅代價，就作別論。咁所以可以見得咧，政府亦都其實認同版權擁有人其實係可以透過私。

96
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:19,170
私人協議或者呢啲合約咧，對網民嘅二次創創作咧係著作出約束嘅。咁包括現時條例提出嘅六項新增豁免，可以咧因為合約係如果不具凌駕性咧，誒誒，如果呢個合約具有誒凌駕性嘅話咧，係令到市民。

97
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,260
with the court.

98
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,800
become the defendant.

99
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,550
The courts never there to prosecute the good, let alone persecute.

100
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:13,490
That's the argument here. It's got nothing to do with separation of powers.

101
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:26,140
I think that the woman screenwriter, she actually told the press that the copyright of that movie.

102
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:17,790
yes，and the screenwriter of this very popular movie is Sunny Chan， she I think。

103
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:24,680
And another colleague here，馬鳳國，Quite rightly said，to protect consumer rights，you can always go to the consumer council.

104
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:35,910
quite indeed, except there's something you have to do on your own. You have to actively go and get your rights protected.

105
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:46,650
但係，what he failed, Mr Rousek, to understand, is that the court is there to prosecute the bad and protect the good.

106
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:39,610
has been sold to Hollywood. She told the press last December, and she said, what did she get as the screenwriter? Ten US dollars.

107
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:49,970
Is that fair again? And I also like to remind Mr. Marfong what I was told reminded just now that if Mr. Marfong is quite so keen to protect our

108
00:30:52,970 --> 00:31:07,330
The good, right? A perfectly innocent man, or at least the defendant thought he was, should be taken to court and let the court decide whether he might be ignorant, but he's still actually innocent.

109
00:31:50,450 --> 00:32:07,550
Copyrights，especially in the entertainment arena，he should note a particular case。There's a movie，a popular local movie by the name of《新紮師妹》，I think in English is《Love Undercover》。

110
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:58,130
This is what we mean by copyright protection, or indeed contract override. Exactly what this screenwriter has signed any contract with the movie producer and so on and so forth.

111
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:11,680
Another argument by Mr. Rasic goes as far as saying that our honourable member Dennis Quock's amendment would the effect of which could amount to harming the separation of powers.

112
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,920
and。

113
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,790
authority。

114
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,950
now to come back.

115
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,310
應該 take legal

116
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,120
Seriously, to what we're talking about here.

117
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,620
你會 assume，normally that。

118
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,580
what I failed to actually think at a time thoroughly, that is of course, yeah.

119
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,210
We're talking about consent between adults, fine, and that's why.

120
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:40,430
basic right to enter into agreements, contracts with other people.

121
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:27,360
most people, I should assume, wouldn't particularly think of freedom of contract.

122
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:23,630
That's why I still at the time of at the end of the bills committee, I personally.

123
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:35,930
just didn't occur to you, right? If you're not in that sort of business, copyright business, for example.

124
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:48,570
How could you say that you can just make a law and override my personal wishes and things?

125
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:33,240
had reservations about Dennis's amendments. I thought you might be infringing my

126
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:19,610
在生活，我們講自由，自由的各種。我們通常，我通常，會注意自由的報紙、自由的言論、表達等。

127
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:31,970
這係真係 nonsense。what he talking about basically is that the executive and the judicial no the executive and the legislative powers should not never harm or or tread upon powers that are that should be rested.

128
00:33:43,010 --> 00:34:03,020
Let's do something together. Let's get this done. So there's a contract between you and me. We agree to do the what's going to be done on conditions of such as and so on, and verbally even the agreement.

129
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,790
我係。

130
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,480
no，I。

131
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,510
public arena。

132
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,470
在公共domain。

133
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,080
私隱合同， fine。

134
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,860
really add on to the.

135
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,750
what about public interest?

136
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,070
what about public policy?

137
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,970
at a time I wasn't sure, so I refrained from talking because I don't want to be seen as

138
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:05,240
Seriously, answered my question. It's from Yale, Yale University, Yale Human Rights and Development.

139
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:38,440
Where do you draw the line? What is private and what is public? Anyway, so having giving it a lot of thought and

140
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:56,050
Anyone by legal training, right? I'm not. I have nothing to do with the legal trade, but I do read and read quite a lot. And I actually found this line which.

141
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:43,700
debate here. So subsequently, since then, I did quite a bit of research. Of course, we all knew that I'm not anyone by. I'm not.

142
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:20,950
我 lend you some money at some interest rate, five percent and so on and so forth. It's okay. It's between two parties. It's absolutely private. But when it comes to huge

143
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:28,060
always follow one journalistic rule and that is if in doubt leave it out. If I don't know anything, I would keep my mouth shut. And if in doubt, check it out. And I did, I have done. So here I am talking about what I want to.

144
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:59,520
The things, I'm now prepared to say what I failed to talk at towards the end of our bills committee sessions because I wasn't sure at a time. I'm not blaming the chairman of the bills committee for not giving me time at all. No, no, I'm not saying that. I I am stressing that.

145
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,530
arbitrary regulation.

146
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,290
That's exactly my question.

147
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,940
and I double checked the copyright.

148
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,390
what I normally call public interest.

149
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,780
so ever without written written permission, except

150
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,950
to regulate it in the common interest.

151
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,670
Their property rights, nor contract rights, are absolute.

152
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:15,180
equally fundamental with the private private right is that of the public.

153
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:16,440
journal， it's a particular article. Now don't worry, I'm not reading out paragraph after paragraph. I'm just reading out two lines.

154
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:13,180
thing here, it says all rights reserved. Of course, although nobody's too sure what what's all in all rights reserved. But it does say here, because I.

155
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:56,310
For animal rights campaign，呢本書，which I always quote， and I actually learned the word "umf" from this particular book called *Molly and Me*.

156
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:52,720
Except in the case of brief quotations embodied in critical articles and reviews, so I would assume I'm quite safe with my quotations and things. But.

157
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:43,580
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would claim I am a keen reader. Although, unlike the education chief who said who boasted that he would read up to 30 books a month or something, right? No, I would say I read one book a month on average, one book.

158
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:37,230
The first line was: It's actually a question. It says here, can a right, a basic right, right of contract, contractual spirit, we talk about, right? It says, quote, can a right be both fundamental and subject to a fairly large amount of?

159
00:37:43,840 --> 00:38:03,850
basic human right, rights of contract, and the answer is it is clear that the right to contract a contract is subject to some limitation. Full stop. Quote: It's the ruling of a court case in America. It says, quote, neither

160
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:33,520
I don't know if I've met. I've made myself very clear. I tend to quote this book fairly often, either physically in real life or in the cyber world. And it says here, no part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner whatsoever.

161
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,860
Have I?

162
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,980
這本書。

163
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,240
我double checked。

164
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,450
this book's copyright.

165
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,470
我用它very often in the last.

166
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,840
關於呢個contract override business。

167
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,610
The thing is, I not only quoted.

168
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:43,380
然後我 told myself， maybe I'm just getting too uptight。

169
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:40,050
我有 scanned pages of this book。我有 actually had a little video clip。

170
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,800
no one's going to take you to court for that. What are you making all these of?

171
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm not sure. I would need legal consultation, legal opinion on this. So.

172
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:29,590
10 years for teaching English. I am an English teacher as well. Especially white elephants. It's such a popular phrase these days, right?

173
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:54,180
the to teach English, right, to kiddies to and to try to arouse their interest. Oh, elephants white and what it's about? Why it's wasting money? Blah blah. Now.

174
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:23,750
retrieval，gosh，I do have that online clip of mine. Technically，I could，I must have infringed.

175
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:11,420
Here and please, Dennis Quag, must listen. Always reserved, right? No part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system.

176
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,480
嗱。

177
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,490
好張良議員。

178
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,740
誒，主席。

179
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,430
remarks and fuss about for.

180
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,530
what's this about now?

181
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,550
copyright about books.

182
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,470
This is more than unsettling.

183
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,550
我唔可以借畀任何人。

184
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,770
Government who prosecute our citizen and put them on trial in court.

185
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:06,730
And maybe maybe in modern times, all those book.

186
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:31,390
rather meaningful life, right? It was quite lenient, I thought, in my understanding of.

187
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:13,290
condition that it shall not, by way of trade or otherwise, be lent, resold, hired out.

188
00:42:51,640 --> 00:43:04,150
to teach politics, and surprise, surprise, the line actually said, except in the United States of America, this book is sold subject to the

189
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:51,360
This is the newest. A friend gave it to me, Thinking Fast and Slow, by a Nobel Awardee, Daniel Kahneman. Quite meaningful. I use it.

190
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:22,630
stipulations copyright stipulations would have become just a bit more lenient, you would think, because with the first one, this novel not novel, Mali and me is about a doc's.

191
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:13,570
With this book, I'm not too sure now. I may need to check with Dennis Kwok, my most likable colleague here, whether I've done anything wrong legalistically or technically at least. Now, this book is called Red Herring and White Elephants.

192
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:43,760
So we need some amendment to assure consumer rights, about readers' rights。請你停止發言。I would like to point out to the honourable member. You might have breached your journalistic, you know, principle. Hong Kong court does not prosecute our citizen is the

193
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,120
誒。

194
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,250
嘅話咧，而政府。

195
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,680
我係覺得完全應該做嘅。

196
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,050
即係大家都要合理，同埋咧係有一個誠意去經。

197
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,620
就佢開出面又講話咧，誒。

198
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,950
就係串流嚇呢個呢個傳播權利，依家冇法律禁止㗎嘛。

199
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,930
嗰個嗰個豁免咧，係拎走咗一啲嘅權利。

200
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,450
本身就拎走咗，網民依家係唔會受到禁制嘅權利。

201
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:02,940
唔去一齊參與，或者積極去到回應嘅話咧，政府係失職嘅。

202
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:45,470
我先回應辛之難啦，即係馬逢國議員今朝講嘅幾個觀點嚇，簡單嘅啫。

203
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:07,560
誒，今朝喺呢個環節發言嘅時候咧，就有幾位同有兩三位同事咧講到呢個四方會談嘅問題。噉，你請你容許我咧好簡單講講我嘅睇法。

204
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:18,700
我記得我喺第一次二讀發言嘅時候都講過話，應該要經，就我覺得唔應該係貼板一塊噉啊，仲比阿局長咧係揶揄我，就話我咧你係咪可唔可以代表曬泛民主派咁講啊噉樣？當然冇人可以代表曬一切人。

205
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:35,120
去宣示一個立場喺呢度，不過我只係代表一個一個有誠意嘅態度嘅表示，就係話呢啲問題咧應該大家要透過一個談判嚟到咧係找出一個出路啊！我就講唔多啦，主席。

206
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:14,150
咁咧，於是乎咧，你就話你仲要搞啲所謂呢啲禁誒限制呢個誒呢個合約零價噉樣，係唔公平。噉我就針對呢個拎走啲權利呢個講法，其實成個嘅條例嘅制定。

207
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,890
第三。

208
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,980
佢嘅收益係有限嘅。

209
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,460
嘅時候咧，法庭都要睇埋係咪牟利嘅。

210
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,660
呢個好緊要，要睇埋係咪牟利㗎嘛？你睇清楚嗰個法例啦。

211
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,830
透過互聯網就正正係噉，其實你先拎走咗市民嘅權利啊！

212
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,880
依家係你要立法去要確認有傳播權。

213
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:03,250
噉嘅原原則咧，唔係使大台船、大企業受益。

214
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:26,910
一定係大財團，好多時候啊，你嗰啲時，你啲誒誒創作者。

215
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:34,410
當你未成名嘅，或者你未知道你個創作品係會幾成功嘅時候咧，你個版權都賣斷咗啦，已經。

216
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:47,020
所以你唔好嘅出發點咧，就話依家我哋希望有啲合理嘅豁免，就係拎走咗呢個版權人嘅權利，呢個完全係本末倒置嘅。

217
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:45,510
如果大財團大企業去利用第二次創作係牟利嘅話，就梗係唔得啦。如果唔牟利嘅乜所謂啫？我想就冇乜所謂。咁所以咧就係誒。

218
00:46:47,560 --> 00:47:00,220
第二點，馬元都講過話咧，就唔係淨係大財團、大商家誒誒誒嚟到誒受益於呢個所謂contract override呢啲噉嘅原則噉樣。

219
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:58,570
呢點咧，所以又係唔成立嘅。噉我我希望大家咧睇清楚咧，其實contract override呢樣嘢本身啊嗰個唔公平嘅地方喺邊度，而我哋而家要求。

220
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:30,720
喺呢啲問題上高涉及到一啲權益之間嘅一啲嘅衝突嚇或者矛盾，而需要揾一個適當嘅平衡咧。呢啲問題係應該絕對要大家坐低傾，繼續傾傾到有結果為止。如果大家願意傾嘅話，當然係要in good faith。

221
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:54,340
依家既然陳陳嘉林議員代表建制派嘅同事提出，我哋呢邊民主派嘅議員亦都覺得係應該支持，而我亦都相信版權界裏邊無論係版權持有者嘅代表，以致到用者啊，所謂網民嘅代表，啲願意傾。

222
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:20,870
其實攞嚟講，識做呢啲合約嘅點會唔係大財團、大商家唔方鬱敏出本書，佢嗌人哋籤張口份合約咩？緊就唔會啦，係嘛？攞嚟講，我哋好多我哋好多呢啲小作家出嗰啲都唔唔係好介意人哋翻版啊，有人睇最緊要啊。攞嚟講，不過依家最大嘅問題咧，你做親呢咁複雜嘅合約咧。

223
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:57,270
呢個好清楚，呢個行業你點會唔清楚啫？其實最大嘅得益者當然係買起呢個版權嘅財團同埋企業啦。咁但係都呢個都冇所謂，呢個係一個商一個自由世界，你願意賣你嘅版權咪賣咯，係咪啊？咁所以咧就係，但係就唔好話咧呢個contract override呢啲噉嘅噉。

224
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:25,260
馬逢國然後講話咧：，餵你啲原創人賣畀啲大企業，你啲唔上得大企業，走去利用呢個豁免嚟到又又戲仿，又又又諷刺，用第二次創作噉樣。不過我提醒咧，就係呢個公平處理呢個豁免嘅原則咧，當佢應用。

225
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,230
第二點。

226
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,360
嚇就唔應該。

227
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,500
其實唔係。

228
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,680
資料啦，一啲歷史嘅資料啦，係咪啊？咁所以咧。

229
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,210
噉佢唔係咧，佢但係佢有利用《三國志》裏邊嘅一啲一啲嘅。

230
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,820
噉啊！今日阿長毛講得好好啊，係咪啊？《三國演義》噉樣，你話佢咪抄《三國志》啊？

231
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:03,220
複雜啦？點樣咧？就每一個個案咧，你就唔係睇法律啦，你仲要睇埋合約。

232
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:07,490
要限制呢啲零價性合約嗰個道理喺邊度？嗱，其實我盡量係。

233
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:56,970
就係其實咧，如果你容許係有合約嘅零價咧，噉就會好複雜。

234
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:17,850
就係第二次創造另一個天地。我哋係要保障合理地保障嚇呢啲噉嘅權益，尤其是。

235
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:47,310
你知道牟利本身係唔掂嘅，如果你用呢啲豁免，就好大可能會唔掂嘅。咁所以咧，你要明白呢一點，呢個權利係要保障嘅。

236
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:55,080
話完全係抄襲，唔係抄襲，唔係話係利用嚇嚟到嚟到咧係剝削一個原創人，唔係嘅。其實第二創作另開一個天地。

237
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:18,470
咁其實我喺第一次發言就講咗咧，呢個大英圖呢個英國圖書館啊，British Library曾經做過一個研究咧，發覺佢哋簽咗成一百種合約，而個個合約裏邊。

238
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:23,560
唔去重複，有啲同事都講過，不過我真係重申幾個項目最緊要嘅。第一，保障我哋最基本嘅權益，《基本法》講到好多同事講咗啊，《基本法》裏面講到自由嘅誒表達啊，消息嘅傳播呢，即係自由嘅嘅表達。

239
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:43,850
創作嘅自由、出版嘅自由，呢啲好基本嘅原則，呢個使到我哋嘅社會進步發達嘅其中一個最重要嘅嘅基石。呢個我哋必要有呢個噉嘅社會嘅環境。咁依家咧就係誒，我哋發覺社會上個的確係有一種第二次創作，而呢啲第二次嘅創作。

240
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:38,140
我哋一所講嘅幾樣闊誒嘅嘅嘅闊面咧，戲謔啊、諷刺啊嗰啲噉嘅問題咧，都係喺今日一個社會上高好多人啊，係利用呢個噉嘅方式嚟到咧，係參與政治、參與公共事務，而唔係牟利嘅。

241
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,330
第三點。

242
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,310
呢個商業合約。

243
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,990
有幾多闊面去用？

244
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,750
所在有嘅。

245
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,410
我哋點解要容許？

246
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,310
一個好簡單嘅公平原則。

247
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,460
依家仲加埋啲修訂啦，仲要睇埋合約。

248
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,210
係保障大家嘅，係符合公眾利益嘅。

249
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,940
有啲人係可以，因為佢有嗰個更高嘅議價能力。

250
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,380
原來你話畀佢聽，唔係淨要睇一個咁複雜嘅一個版權條例。

251
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:27,320
如果我哋成個社會透過立法都會覺得嗰啲豁免係應該有嘅。

252
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,100
長財雄勢大，然後逼人哋簽合約，去放棄一啲法定。

253
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:38,130
咩嘢可以做，咩嘢唔可以做，唔係睇法例嘅，原來要睇每個合約裏邊係容許。

254
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:30,600
即係誒禁，即係限制呢個零價性、合約零價性，即即係所謂所謂限制個豁免咧，係咪都唔同嘅？

255
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:52,500
嗱，你諗下幾大件事，一百款合約要揾人去睇，要揾律師去睇，然後先知道邊啲嘢可以再做，邊邊度可以做，邊啲嘢唔可以做。對小市民嚟講，點點捱得住啊？

256
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:14,490
咁所以咧，好多專家已經講咗咧，你會使到嗰個法律係更加複雜，因為咧仲會牽涉到咧複雜嘅嚇，同埋咧多多種類嘅。

257
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,560
所謂contract out。

258
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,020
邊個人有錢打官司咧？

259
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,790
佢就話：我幫啲小市民係啱嘅。

260
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:46,030
係會好隨便拎呢啲問題去法庭。

261
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,320
嗰就就喺法例之外再納藥。

262
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,770
畀一啲任何嘅人士嘅一啲權利咧。

263
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:42,550
其實有咩咁大件事咧？你仲要記住一樣嘢，唔係普通人。

264
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,410
呢個係好公平嘅一樣嘢嚟㗎，其實呢樣嘢呢個我哋傾咗咁耐。

265
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,390
呢一啲幾呢一紮嘅闊綿，係已經係一個好合理嘅平衡。

266
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:54,340
係唔應該嘅。如果我哋今今日通過咗，如果大家通過咗呢啲闊面，係應該要有嘅。

267
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:06,820
係，其實上高係我哋公共政政策咧，係唔容許。

268
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:01,430
係合理嘅，係符合公眾利益嘅。點解轉手可以畀人用合約去拎走咧？我哋已經舉咗好多例子。

269
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:37,340
當然，我哋仲會加埋一個fair use啊，即係個公平嘅使用嚇，即係擴闊咗公平處理啦，多一個噉，其實都係法庭嘅啫，都係法庭再睇多幾個原則。其實我啲講過嗰四個原則，都已經喺埋個法例裏邊已經。

270
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:23,690
兩兩兩兩兩百兩嚿水嘅啫嘛，佢嗰啲成萬幾兩萬蚊，點似咧噉樣？噉我每每年啊都唔知處理噉嘅個案，我同大家講，L.V.嗰個總裁啱先嚟到立法會特登見我，都係講呢啲嘢。

271
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,110
嗯。

272
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,390
見律師都好複雜。

273
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,350
就係，既然我哋覺得。

274
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:52,030
約咧係相當複雜嘅，我諗啊，廖議員都好清楚嗰個合約咧，即係嗰個條例咧。

275
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:10,310
嘅影響或壓力，或任或運用任何不公平的手法。

276
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:09,170
普通市民係唔會同佢打官司，都冇錢打官司。其實有啲案咧係好邊緣嘅，我覺得。我睇過嗰個款式咧，同佢L.V.

277
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:42,280
第三點嘅消費者是否能夠明白與提供貨品嘅服務或可能提供貨品或服務有關嘅任何文件？呢個做到啦。

278
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:58,670
來源喺邊度？你停止賣咧，噉我哋就唔會告佢㗎噉樣。噉我話你告佢都冇用嘅，冇水嘅，邊有錢啫？嗰啲個個當個成檔嘢畀埋你，我話係咪啊？咁所以就佢哋咧都明白咧。

279
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:22,530
做咩？Hermes嗰啲係差好遠嘅，其實不過只係有啲地方佢係黐黐地噉樣，但係你冇得打嘅嘛，你打咩啫？咁所以大家明呢樣嘢咧，你唔好嗌啲小市民立亂去去法庭。

280
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:30,520
嘢咁一個小市民噉啊，相對相差好遠啦。第二，是否由另一由另一方所作嘅行為，以致消費者必須遵守啲條件，而呢啲條件對於保障另一方嘅合法權益而言咧，按理並非必要，都唔係太難呢樣嘢。

281
00:53:48,450 --> 00:54:08,460
我自己做議員，幫好多小市民去解決啲問題。個個都係震騰騰拎封信嚟，話我收到封來私信，點搞啊？噉樣又又話我買咗件嘢，好似L.V.喎嚇，好似呢個呢個誒誒誒誒呢個布拉達喎噉樣，布拉達喎誒點搞啊？噉樣其實都唔係我嗰件嘢。

282
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:47,160
因為佢哋的確唔係有心，佢都唔識咁複雜啊。喺喺大陸買翻嚟嗰啲廠，咁所以好多時候都嗌佢哋即刻停止賣，唔好同人打呢啲嘢，打嚟做咩嘢噉就。然後咧就話畀對方聽，究竟係邊啲個貨物個來源喺邊度？噉佢就話我哋咁做係啱嘅，應該同第啲同事講，佢又唔好撐佢呢啲嘢。你最緊要話個來。

283
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:44,810
只係撞啱有個議員啱識呢啲嘢，咁可以問下有啲叫法律諮詢。如果唔係都唔知點算噉，所以咧就大家要明白呢點。所以最後一點就翻返去今日啊，廖長江議員講嘅嘢。我啱今朝唔喺度，不過我聽咗同事講咧，佢都係再講翻嗰個不合理嗰個誒誒合約嗰個問題。其實不合理嗰個合約。

284
00:55:52,790 --> 00:56:12,800
就法庭咧，要考慮嘅因素係係有一係列嘅。噉我簡單倒讀嗰幾個因素出嚟咧嚇。佢第一，消費者與另一家另一方之間以價地位的相對實力。咁呢個容易啦，係嘛？噉你你誒去去一間大公司買。

285
00:56:42,660 --> 00:57:02,670
嗱，第四者咧就比較又複雜啦。嘅有關提供貨品或服務，或可能提供貨品或服務方便另一方或代表另一方行事的人，有否對消費者或代表消費者行事的人施加不當？

286
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:30,740
咁當然最後一點咧，就消費者向另外一方獲得相同或對等貨品嘅情況之下，所需付嘅金價，即係金價唔係好離譜嗱。其實咧，你睇下嗰啲因素咧係複雜嘅，而每樣嘢咧係需要嗰個嗰個所謂受到不公平合約嚇誒所誒。

287
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,170
就此發言。

288
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,780
我有問議員。

289
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,440
多謝主席。

290
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:44,060
嘅人拎走市民所享有嘅權利。

291
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,560
署名李慧瓊同埋蔣麗雲，跟住個區員叫吳保強。

292
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:37,500
因為我住喺公屋，我又攞唔係我，我又非公屋，又非中環住户，係嘛？

293
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:20,410
呢啲豁免係應該嘅，係合理嘅，符合公眾利益嘅。你做咩仲要我哋去法庭？

294
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:31,690
咁於是有個街坊問我：鬱敏，你可唔可以問佢幫下手攞兩次性生活津貼啊？

295
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,930
不用合約條文，凌架版權條例法定豁免條文。

296
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:49,260
嗱，我頭先聽咗好多支持，又聽咗好多成客都喺度講呢個所謂合約凌駕性。

297
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:27,520
防止或限制作出任何根據版權條例嘅相關條文，就唔會構成侵犯版權嘅行為。

298
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:25,300
佢話咧，即係申請呢個協助申請關愛基金嗰啲非中户同埋非公屋嘅住户攞啲一次性生活津貼。

299
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:41,830
定明呢一個條款咧，不得強制執行。呢一係列嘅修訂案原本就係郭榮亨議員提出嘅，咁不過法案委員會表決通過，就由法案委員會主席陳鑑林代為提出。

300
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:51,400
誒誒，所壓榨嘅嚇個人咧，即係所謂所謂原句，你要提出證據嘅個法庭唔係咁輕易就話呢個合約係不公平嘅，因為法庭嘅出發點樣覺得，即係大家係如果係如果大家係好明係你係好清楚神智清醒，你係成年人簽合約係唔應該立亂推翻嘅，所以。

301
00:57:51,400 --> 00:58:11,410
呢個呢個咧，以我做咁多案件咧，知道咧係比較極端嘅情況先得。好啦，你而家將佢呢啲個樣嘢應用喺一啲噉樣嘅合商業合約嗰度，即係係咪適合嘅咧？我都唔敢講話呢啲係咪屬於貨品或者服服務啊？我都唔知道。但係最大一個問題咧，主席。

302
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:40,790
然後就話呢啲叫不合理，呢個不公平合理嘅嘅合約咧，噉樣唔需要啊，因為我哋根本都覺得呢啲豁免係依啲法律所賦予，即係製成一種權利賦予大家，唔應該畀一啲有權有勢大企業啊，或者任何人都好啦，佢有議價力。

303
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:18,270
即係呢個就版權豁免加入限制合約凌駕性的條文，噉就係第一節嘅分組辯論。咁內容都係圍繞住陳監林議員代表法案委員會提出嘅一係列修正案，噉就限制透過合約條款防。

304
00:59:50,880 --> 01:00:10,890
即係大家對個聖字咧，就情有獨鍾係咪？喂，合約零價咪合約零價咯，大佬係咪？合約唔係最大嘅噉係嘛？噉你成日都要個聖字啫。我有一日喺九龍城，即係都係我選區，就睇到一條橫額，就民建聯出嘅噉啊，上邊。

305
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,180
OK。

306
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,770
誒。

307
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,170
請佢打官司就。

308
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,560
都有著數，係嘛？

309
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,270
呢兩座嘅大狀都發達嘅。

310
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,550
啊！當然真相梗唔係咁啦，係咪？

311
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,140
否則，條例一切嘅法定豁免就形同虛設。

312
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,690
器官捐贈又出嚟啦，係嘛？一次性工作又出嚟啦，咁點搞咧？係咪？

313
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:47,410
零價性係零價合約定合約零價咧？係咪都講到一嚿嚿，所以咪跟住講到。

314
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:48,440
嗱，禁止透過合約條款防止或者限制作出所謂版權條例嘅允許行為，係非常之重要嘅。

315
01:01:53,570 --> 01:02:05,080
容許合約條文凌駕，即係某一啲喺本會已經花咗好長時間討論嘅闊面條文，先至係真正嘅浪費公堂。

316
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:17,730
點解版權條例嘅法定豁免可以透過私人合約條款免除或者限制咧？係嘛，大家都要問呢個問題。相信有好多人係一頭霧水。

317
01:00:48,290 --> 01:01:08,300
即係語無倫次，所以個性字好危險嘅嚇。嗱，呢啲修訂案咧，分別針對《版權條例》第三十九、三十九大A四十一A二二百四十一同埋二百四十一A同埋二百四十二A條裏邊規定一啲允許作為嘅條文咧，提出修訂內容咧，幾乎係一樣嘅。

318
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:31,820
籠統就叫做合約凌駕性嘅修正案，所以我覺得秘書處咧或者主席啊，都應該將嗰個辯論主題啊，所以就版權豁免加入限制合約凌駕性的條文咧，改一改佢啦，唔好唔好係又個性啦，係咪咁於是就啊呢個即係強制性。

319
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:38,020
喺呢個會議廳裏邊，我哋有啲好多大狀，有啲大狀就猛同你講合約精神，有啲大狀就話：，誒合約唔可以凌駕嘅。噉我哋真係呢啲都係法律界人士，我就真係拗曬頭嘅，唔知信阿廖長江好啊，定係信阿郭榮亨好喎？兩個都係大狀嚟嘅喎，係咪啊？噉你話普通市民？

320
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:58,030
民係咪一頭霧水咧？請問喂，香港自由社會、自由經濟，合約好緊要。我哋要尊重合約精神，但係有啲議員話唔係呢一個合約不能凌駕，係嘛不能凌駕呢啲豁免。噉我聽邊位大狀好咧？後來我一諗呢條文越定得複雜，越定得多爭議性嘅。

321
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,980
因此。

322
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,810
即係我哋局長。

323
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,060
嗱，呢一條講咩咧？

324
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,490
嗱，所謂其他權利及義務係講咩咧？

325
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,410
當然就係包括私人合約條款。

326
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,950
第三十七括弧一條清楚定明。

327
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,580
嗰陣時，我冇喺呢啲法案議會咧，我一定幫佢改宗文，OK。

328
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:20,250
當時嘅議員可能忽略咗第三十七括弧一。

329
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,600
呢個分佈係再有就版權作品而允許嘅作為。

330
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:14,680
本分部指嘅就係《版權條例》第二部嘅第三分部。

331
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:15,480
嗱，立法局，立法局喺一九九七年審議版權條例嘅時候。

332
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:28,970
最近經常念念有詞嘅涵蓋相當全面嘅六十幾項法定豁免。

333
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:07,910
嗱，自從一九九七年訂立咗之後啊，呢個版權條例第三十七條一條從來都冇修訂過。

334
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:34,350
本分部嘅條文指明，某啲喺儘管有版權存在嘅情況下，仍可就版權作品而作出嘅作為。

335
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:45,960
喺呢一個部分嘅條文，即係嗰個法定豁免啦，就唔會影響限制作出任何該等指明作為的任何其他權利或義務。

336
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,430
誒。

337
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,950
四好就係。

338
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,210
咩叫三保咧？

339
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,540
誒條例草案咧，就引入六大項。

340
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:03,610
最好笑就係知識知識產權處處長梁嘉麗女士咧。

341
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,480
叫做三保條例同埋四好條例嚟形容。

342
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:02,140
儘管版權條例豁免若干允許行為、允許作為。

343
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:17,410
雖然呢個係民事責任，但係都係可大可小，係嘛？

344
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:42,480
嗱，政府當局硬推呢個條例草案嘅時候，就不斷話。

345
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:32,460
呢度好多人都可能未知，佢講三寶係講咩咧？三寶四好啊！呢條修訂條例。

346
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:10,820
係侵犯版權嘅責任啊！有關人士仍然有機會因為違反合約而負上法律責任。

347
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:43,310
咩三保啊？保障版權擁有人，保障用家在合理範圍裏邊使用版權作品，保障言論自由，噉啊三保咯。

348
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:58,160
嘅新嘅豁免，言論自由咧就因此得到更大嘅保障，用家可以喺合理嘅範圍使用版權作品。

349
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:14,270
就甚至即係唔知係咪佢發明嘅啦，或或者佢覺得呢一個講法係好有型啊？我就話呢啲係最狗屁不通嘅講法啊！

350
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:57,430
對版權擁有人好，對用家好，對中介平台即係服務提供者好，同埋對整體社會創業產創意產業發展同埋經濟都好。

351
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:34,830
誒，對於啲小市民嚟講，佢都有機會傾家蕩產，係咪啊？好似最近我司法複核上訴、申請上訴，佢我輸咗，個法官就要我畀七皮嘅，係咪啊？咁都好，林鄭月娥話你有九萬三一個月，都未夠你一個月人工，係咪啊？

352
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:58,870
該等條文只係關乎侵犯版權嘅問題，嗱呢個好緊要，而不影響限制作出任何該等指明作為的任何其他權利或義務。局長有冇睇過呢條啊？一九九七年嘅版權條例三十七括弧一。

353
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:19,640
係。

354
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,280
有。

355
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,920
總係好過冇。

356
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,940
佢喺念個咒啫，你就。

357
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,290
我記得八十年代咧。

358
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,960
嗱，本席認為條例草案連同原有嘅法定豁免。

359
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:40,940
六十幾項嘅闊別雖然未臻完善嚇，但係好多人都會認為。

360
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:27,650
即係即係，我當做仲棟篤笑噉，但係氹下大家開心啫嘛！一次性生活津貼，你要唔要啊？

361
01:07:53,940 --> 01:08:00,900
喂，你講呢啲三好四好有咩用啫？係咪？具體嘅事實就唔係啊嘛，係咪？

362
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:22,860
爆你唔記唔翻啦，係咪？講文明、講道德、講禮物、講禮貌、講秩序，係咪？噉啊，為之唔講咯，係咪？

363
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:33,680
四誒呢個四美係誒唔係四美係咩啊？知唔知咩美啊？黃毓民，你嚟題啦！我梗係冇離題啦，傻傻地我而家講佢三寶四好啊！

364
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:12,980
喺中國有藥商所謂五講四美三熱愛，我想問下呢度呢啲有共產黨背景嗰啲老友，記唔記得八十年代嘅五講四美三熱愛係講咩啊？黃國興知唔知啊？

365
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:58,960
但係由於版權擁有人佢係可以肆意透過合約條款限制呢一啲噉嘅法定豁免嘅，你唔可以話畀我聽，誒唔會嘅噉，即係等於好多時立法嗰啲法係咩咧？係緊箍咒嚟嘅。

366
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:53,440
喂，因為你噉樣噏法咧，你認為好記，但係結果咧，啲人都係唔記得嘅。我話畀你聽啊，你唔同喺中國大陸咧強逼要記，不過呢班唔係畀中國大陸共產黨洗腦就唔使啦。三熱愛就係熱愛中華人民共和國，熱愛社會主義，熱愛中國共產黨。誒，我熟過你啦，真係係咪？

367
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:21,330
嗱，你又好啊，你係唔識講呢啲啊？佢可能讀得嗰啲大陸大陸書多啊。呢位呢位知識知識產權處處長真係勁啊，係咪？即係我隨即諗起隨口噏啫，主席，你唔好話大到我可我可以講五節。我而家話畀你聽，我準備嘅資料。不過因為大家悶悶地，即係等啲氣氛。

368
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:19,250
係嘛？好似唐三藏噉，佢冇辦法對付法力無邊嘅孫悟空，噉佢有乜辦法咧？佢就有一套緊箍咒。先探孫悟空咧，就帶咗個金剛箍話畀佢聽啦。靚仔，嗱，今年後年咧就嚟嘛。靚仔呢一個頭飾冇得頂嘅係嘛？咁呢個孫悟空咪帶咯，一帶。

369
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,930
受制於任何嘅合約條款。

370
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,390
即係同意啊！

371
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,490
海市蜃樓，係咪啊？

372
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,140
有通天本領都冇用啊！呢啲叫個緊箍咒。

373
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,440
我就曾經嘗試提出修訂第三十七條。

374
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:18,410
就算全部獲得通過，仍然係有不足之處。

375
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,550
喂，有好多惡法避而不用，佢咪係嗰個緊箍咒嘅作用咯？係咪啊？

376
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,380
嗱，郭榮亨議員建議嘅修正案只係針對六項條文。

377
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:24,450
版權擁有人仍然可以透過合約條款限制其他嘅法定豁免。

378
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:48,400
修訂草案嘅人嘅講法係嘛？咁但係，如果啲版權擁有人，

379
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:41,230
即係有好過冇，係嘛？呢個係政府嘅講法，亦都係支持版權條例。

380
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:51,130
即係唔通其他嗰啲豁免可有可無咩？係咪？假如我哋採用美國概括模式嘅豁免，公平使用、限制合約零價。

381
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:36,810
嗱，郭議員發言嘅時候就解釋點係針，定係點解針對六條最重要嘅豁免提出修正案咧？咁呢個係仿效英國嘅做法。嗱，我咧就未能。

382
01:10:51,770 --> 01:11:05,290
誒呢個法定即係豁免嘅條文，咁又要點搞咧？何去何從咧？請問係咪嗱？你好多人喺度講公平使用，就係講美國啦，係咪？啊，所以。

383
01:09:48,710 --> 01:10:03,710
佢係可以任意透過合約條款嚟限制呢啲法定豁免嘅，咁有就分分鐘變成冇，係嘛？所謂即係六啊幾項嗰啲法定修嘅豁免咧，就分分鐘就變成咧，即係。

384
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:30,850
將各議員修正案嘅原則延展到適用於成個第二部嘅第三分部，就頭先我提到咗三廿七一括弧一。換句説話講，呢一個即係我提出嘅呢一個修正案咧，如果獲得通過，所有嘅法定豁免都唔會受。

385
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,050
係嘛？

386
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,290
主席。

387
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,240
我咧。

388
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,220
因此。

389
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,520
不批准提出。

390
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,910
即係提出嗰啲修正案咧。

391
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,860
嗱，小弟雖然無功而還。

392
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,800
係非常之具建設嘅，係嘛？

393
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:45,730
就影響到成個條例草案冇觸及嘅全面條文。

394
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,640
同埋有建設，我就唔會有建設性嚇，同埋有益性噉啊！

395
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,180
起碼通過呢個辯論，有啲唔熟書嘅人，佢焗住要去熟書。

396
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:59,540
曾玉成咧就裁定呢啲修正案咧就超出咗法定嘅主題，違反議事規則第五十七括弧四括弧四A條。

397
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:45,940
嗱，好多議員喺本次辯論發言嘅時候咧，其實都發表類似嘅講法，但係我就唔知你哋幾時先得到呢個啟發啦，係咪？但係。

398
01:11:47,550 --> 01:12:00,590
你之前冇付諸行動喎，係咪？點解而家忽然間諗起咧？咁可能就有好多人提供啲資料畀你啊！噉你開始就恍然大悟，所以成個辯論咧，主席係非常之有益。

399
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:32,470
通過呢個辯論，咦？發現有好多地方係可以以錯逆真，係嘛？所以呢個係好事嚟嘅，就唔好即係話啊拉布啊，即係個時間好冗長啦。咁嗰時即係搞到我哋即係大家虛耗好多生命喺呢度，係嘛？但係其實都係有益啊。

400
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:25,150
但係，蘇局長咧就已經承諾，條例草案通過咗之後，政府當局咧會隨即啟動修法諮詢。屆時本席必然舊事重提，推動修法，使到整個第二步、第三分步，所有嘅法定豁免都不會受制於任何合約條款。

401
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:52,570
李卓仁議員。

402
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:15,920
咩事啊？你。

403
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:27,020
但係政府本身。

404
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,500
請各位同事翻回座位。

405
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,830
係要求點算法定人數？

406
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,660
希望就算蘇局長來屆冇得留低。

407
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:52,700
有冇搞錯啊？到底政府係想解決問題定唔想解決問題？如果政府係唔想解決問題嘅，當然老實講，主席。

408
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:51,250
嘅功能喺度嘅，係咪？你又繼承上一屆政府啲嘢，下一屆政府又要繼承你嗰啲政策，道理係一樣。講完第一節。

409
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:39,950
你都可以提醒內界，即係嚇，即係要留翻條尾巴畀內界嘅政府咧，即係去對呢個承諾，因為政府係有延續。

410
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:42,530
即係我覺得，其實如果四方係係向一個正面嘅方向去走，然後政府官員去潑冷水。

411
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:31,270
我哋依方面向一個積極嘅方向去走嘅話，咁點解我哋又聽到啲官員啊私下講又話，誒唔得嘅，即係誒政府都好難吞㗎啦噉樣樣，噉係唔係咧？唔該政府澄清下。

412
01:28:52,980 --> 01:29:08,220
代主席，我哋都可以飛起政府嘅，即係如果大家建制派，其實你哋唔使理政府㗎。如果大家根本啲修訂，如果係啊，即係就算分組點票，如果成個議會裏邊同意曬，我哋根本就唔使理政府點諗嘅。

413
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:24,670
當然，政府亦都應該，我覺得佢應該積極啲、正面啲去睇問題，唔應該採取一啲負面嘅態度。既其實而家即係即係我哋喺度整個平台，大家去傾咧。

414
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:58,350
將啊民間嚇網民同埋版權持有人同埋建制泛民啊，大家四方嘅大家嘅分歧，希望可以係解決到。噉我覺得依個係即係啊，如果各方真係有個善意嘅話咧。

415
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:41,260
主席就頭先咧就誒聽到好多同事咧就啲言論，噉我回應下。第一個就而家大家都好，即係有講到個四方會議平台。咁當然我哋工黨係樂見咧個問題係朝向一個正面嘅方向，希望可以。

416
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:18,640
我哋相信係會朝向一個比較積極啲嘅方向，但係即係我哋當然誒，大家都唔敢有咩話一定誒好大嘅期望，因為最後要坐埋傾咗先知道。但係我覺得最失望嘅一樣嘢咧，主席就係即係啲官員嘅態度，即係蘇錦良嘅態度，啊林鄭月娥嘅態度。咁即係如果大家已經

417
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:13,350
三萬塊。

418
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:32,000
請各位同事坐低。

419
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,340
啊！啊，主席，數算法定人數。

420
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:33,570
即係限制合約嘅凌駕性。

421
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,530
嚇？定係反對限制，即係咁講講下，我覺得。

422
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:19,130
於個法律，咁然後就誒梁美芬咧就跟住講咧，就係。

423
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:55,590
轉唔好阻住件事向正面嗰度走，唔好潑冷水。我哋都唔要求你去積極啊！算啦，我放棄你依個政府。

424
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:29,100
同意不能任由強弱一方咧，即係強欺弱嘅。嗱，依度我就唔知佢講咩。嗱，到底佢係啊支持？

425
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:32,370
約自由嗱，依個咧就係即係其實個成個理論本身咧，係一個法律理論，就唔係一個政治理論嚟嘅。政治理論咧就係到底資本主義發展到今時今日嘅自由市場咧，係好多時係以大欺小、以強欺弱咧，其實係要制約嘅。

426
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:47,310
其實唔去負責任，去將嗰個問題係疏解下去協調，倒翻轉要我哋自己做咧。其實政府都係已經失咗職。不過我而家唔係話即係一定大家。如果我哋傾掂數，淨話知佢失職，但係我覺得政府唔好阻住地球。

427
01:29:56,030 --> 01:30:16,040
但係咧，起碼就唔好負面噉，所以即係我覺得即係即係石蘇錦良喺成件事裏邊，真係要算下佢嘅賬。本身去做咗啲咩嘢，由頭到尾都唔積極去協調，搞到今時今日噉。其實大主席咧，其實有另一個方法去處理。

428
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:36,050
而家個處境嘅，就我哋成日講啊，我哋工黨動議咗五萬五一A，啊否決咗，仲有五萬五一B都可由個專責委員會去處理。所以咧，我哋覺得其實，所以咧，我哋覺得其實，美

429
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:56,060
啊！咁即係我意思就係，最後個結論就係喺四方個方面，就係其實如果而家主席用五萬五一邊咧，其實個專責委員一起咧，又等於一個四方會議可以去㗎啦。不過而家主席未有咁決定啦，噉我而家公開呼籲主席咁做啦。咁而今朝亦都聽到一啲言論咧，其實就係。

430
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:16,100
係誒回應我琴日嘅言論嘅，噉啊梁美芬就第一咧就講話一開波咧就話con即係合約法啊，法學即係讀法律第一年就係要讀個誒合約法本身咧就係立約嘅即係權利同自由，噉啊自由市場裏邊咧大家可以有個立

431
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:52,660
即係資本主義要制約，自由市場要制約，依個已經係一個即係好多時全世界嚇政治學上已經公認咗一個一個方向，或者一個係好重要嘅一個啊民主社會發展個一個啊進一步去限制資本主義啊壟斷同埋強。

432
01:31:52,660 --> 01:32:12,670
強欺弱嘅一個啊啊發展一個方向嚟，咁但係即係可可惜，大家再捉翻嗰樣舊嘢出嚟。如果自由市場大曬，根本就唔使法律添啦。既然有法律，法律裏邊有豁免，就冇理由淨係講自由市場，而法律上有豁免，你都冇理由合約可以凌駕。

433
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,100
傳召時間已經過咗，會議廳裏邊不足法定人數，我現在宣佈休會。
