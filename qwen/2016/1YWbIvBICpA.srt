10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:57,150
團體誒每個人發言係五分鐘嘅，噉我亦都提醒代表咧誒，佢哋嘅發言咧同埋嘅意見咧都唔會。

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:50,540
如果誒各位代表如果準備咗發言稿咧，佢可以喺發言上稿上寫上自己嘅名咧，然後就離開之前咧，就交畀職員咧，畀我哋立法會用嘅啊。

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:35,440
須知係已經夾喺喺秘書處發畀各位嘅函件之中，亦都放喺大家嘅桌誒台上嘅，噉就誒旁聽誒嘅公眾席人士亦都可以同在場立法會保安人士咧，可以攞到依啲須知嘅，啊。

13
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:22,880
首先係歡迎誒各團體同埋政府當局係出席今日嘅會議。誒，今日咧係有七個團體代表係報名誒出席會議，另外有三個唔出席會議嘅團體都都分別提出咗意見書嘅。誒，我想提醒各位團體嘅代表咧，如果有需要咧，用。

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:18,080
受到啊立法局權力及特權條例嘅保障，咁亦請佢哋留而喺立法會綜合大樓會議室出席會議，或喺公眾旁聽會嘅公眾人士須知啊，亦都嘅中其中咧係各項保安措施，依份。

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:18,750
嗯，主席，各位早晨。咁誒，我哋咧就係香代表香港投資基金公會嘅。我哋個會最主要咧嘅會員公司咧，都係一啲嘅誒投資管理公司啦。噉就係包括誒管理退休金啊，或者啲零售基金啊，或者一啲係誒。

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:42,110
咁誒喺AEOI呢一個嘅誒立法方面咧，我哋咧基本上咧就係誒支持政府推出呢一個嘅誒法案嘅。咁因為其實呢一樣嘢咧，就係我哋覺得係必不可少啦，同埋亦都係配合嗰個大嘅全球國際趨勢啦。

17
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,940
嚟。

18
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,590
The diagrams before you show you these data pools.

19
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,980
universal right to privacy, including of financial information.

20
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,200
係咁啦，多謝主席。第二位就係Mr.阿亨，就係Step Hong Kong Limited嘅顧 Chair。

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,920
誒法案咧，係其實係好重要嘅一環咧，去突顯我哋呢一方面嘅嗰個嘅工作嘅。

22
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:07,120
of both Hong Kongers who invest and bank abroad, and foreigners who bank and invest here in Hong Kong.

23
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:17,790
它會做這由創造永久的池子，高度敏感、細緻的資料，的本地和外國帳户持有人。

24
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:46,670
這些 abuses 將會 result in identity and property theft, political extortion, political oppression, blackmail and worst of all, the kidnapping of children for ransom.

25
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:33,740
這些數據池不能在現實世界、數字世界，被適當地保護從盜竊和 abuse，由 snoops、 犯罪黑客和盜竊者和不scrupulous 政府機構。

26
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:46,340
溝通噉，我哋都好多謝咧，就係政府同埋誒税局咧，畀到好多機會我哋咧去將業界嘅一啲嘅諗法，尤其一啲技術上咧，就反映畀佢哋。咁嚟緊咧，其實仲有好多工作，噉我哋希望咧就話，即係個重點就係點樣去配合個落實嘅工作。

27
00:02:42,110 --> 00:03:02,120
噉，因為大家見到啦，其實呢一個咧係嗯，即係尤其自從金融風暴之後啦，國際間嗰個嘅税務嘅嗯聯合啦，同埋有個合作咧，係越嚟越多嘅。咁點樣係作為一個負責任嘅國際嘅金融中心咧？我覺得呢一個嘅。

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:29,210
咁誒喺具體落實執行上啦，咁當然就係因為我諗即係每一個業界、每一個即係金融行業咧，尤其咧係誒當然會面對挑戰嘅。咁誒，我哋喺FACO嘅經驗亦都見到啦。咁但係咧喺過去呢一段時間啦，我哋同即係政府方面咧，亦都咧係好緊密。

29
00:03:46,620 --> 00:04:06,630
咁或者最後一點咧，就係關於嗰個嘅誒教育方面啦。我哋覺得咧，喺公眾教育嗰個係非常之重要嘅，因為裏邊牽涉到咧就係關於一啲嘅投資者誒個即係個人嘅資料啦、個保密咧、個安排點啦、佢哋嘅責任係點啦。因為咧喺呢一個嘅誒整個過程。

30
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:26,640
裏邊咧有個好重要嘅工具咧，就係叫self-certification。咁嗰個嘅責任就係委會落咗喺個個人嗰度嘅。咁要明令佢哋明白，誒當中佢哋扮演嘅角色點，佢哋要做啲咩咧？噉我諗其實呢一個咧係未來嘅工作嘅誒重要嘅一環咯。噉我嘅發言。

31
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:54,320
German honourable members, thank you for the opportunity to address you. I address, I represent STEP this morning, which has a detailed submission before you. I wish to make a highlight of a number of points in the in the submission. First, the bill in its current form will seriously damage the fundamental, hard won and

32
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:12,360
The submission gives examples of recent thefts of data to support our contention that this data cannot be adequately protected. Today, the IRS owned up to losing data on 700,000 of its taxpayers. Second, the bill also will also irreputibly.

33
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,860
嗯。

34
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,360
damage。

35
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,250
是attach to that submission.

36
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,960
特異的 sensitivities to confidentiality.

37
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,270
這是什麼？這些submit這這個法案是所有關於。

38
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,810
We do not need this information on our own people.

39
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,270
We need to make two changes to it. First, we need to ensure that our CRS.

40
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,840
once this foreign money leaves our shores, it will be extremely difficult for us to get it back.

41
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,020
72% of the customers are foreigners, many of whom from our own region, with their

42
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:24,790
The USA already the biggest repository of offshore funds in the world will become the world's privacy haven.

43
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,430
它會被用於由那些要求他們的隱私權受到尊重，為既合法和不合法目的。

44
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:18,980
treaty partners do not collect and give to their revenue departments nor ours data on our own people and those who invest here.

45
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:25,260
金融服務業業這裡，which generates 18% of our GDP, contributes significant need to government revenue, employs more than a quarter of a million people.

46
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:54,260
this industry, this risks serious damage, because an incalculable number of these vital foreign investors who we work so hard to attract and keep over the years will leave Hong Kong once they learn that the data is so exposed to the risks that I have mentioned.

47
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:14,550
他們會either retreat and invest within their own borders, legally or otherwise, or they will exploit the gaping loophole in the whole system, namely the USA, because it refuses to sign up to CRS for the reasons that are set out in the submission and in the Economist article which.

48
00:07:41,170 --> 00:08:01,180
第三點是，我們不實際需要威脅私隱權利的我們人民和外國人投資者，或威脅威脅健康我們的金融服務業，為了向OECD和其他人顯示我們真的想幫助在進行的税務逃税戰爭。

49
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,730
比賽。

50
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,740
啊！我會用英文嚟啊！好啊，冇問題。

51
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,570
從一個税standpoint，因為我們唔 tax 我哋嘅人民喺外來來源嘅收入。

52
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,640
this change will eliminate the data pool and the associated risks with it.

53
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:16,680
SEIEMA is fully supportive of the initiative to have AEOI in Hong Kong.

54
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:44,380
好啊！第三位就彭志偉先生，亞洲證券業與金融市場協會，啊，彭生。

55
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:06,200
這些兩項變更將允許香港更好地保護其內地人民及來自海外選擇投資的個人的隱私權。

56
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:42,730
第二，如果我們 tell 我們 CRS 合作夥伴，我們只會報告他們的居民有可報告的帳户。

57
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:26,410
There are several reasons for this. The first one is that the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) is an initiative of the OECD.

58
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:35,910
檢控的税 evasion everywhere， and our genuine commitment to eradicate it. And we can do all this while retaining our sovereignty. Thank you.

59
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:36,450
to increase transparency to combat combat tax evasion, as a member of OECD, Hong Kong must comply with this initiative.

60
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:56,630
The first one is, for example, in 2009, OECD name Hong Kong and put Hong Kong as a blacklist as a tax haven jurisdiction.

61
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:46,710
But apart from the fact that Hong Kong is a member and therefore have to comply with the OECD initiative, what are some of the other reasons? There are a few.

62
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:57,560
那將 significantly reduce the depth of that data pool and thus the risks to foreigners. And we can do this while making it much much harder for foreigners to use Hong Kong to cheat tax in their home countries.

63
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:26,760
它將不無謂地威脅我們作為領先國際金融中心的地位，因為我們將尊重我們外國投資者的私有權。它將使外國人更難逃税，利用香港，而且它將讓我們向國際社會展示我們的。

64
00:09:48,150 --> 00:10:08,160
Thank you very much, Chairman and Honourable Members. I represent the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, ASIFMA. ASIFMA is a regional trade association, an independent regional trade association with more than 19 member firms representing both the sell side and buy.

65
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,670
secondly。

66
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,600
going abroad.

67
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,210
now falling from the previous point.

68
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,990
this is damaging to the reputation of Hong Kong.

69
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,520
and promoting Hong Kong as a offshore RMB centre.

70
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,930
和香港可被 perceived shamefully，once again， as a tax haven。

71
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,910
如果香港不 adopt CRS， in line with other international financial centres。

72
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,030
它會 not be compatible with the government's efforts in implementing AML and KYC rules.

73
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,780
last year in June, the EU categorised Hong Kong as one of the world's 30 worst offending tax havens.

74
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:25,800
政府一直喺宣傳香港係一個國際金融中心，由參與國際組別，例如亞太銀行和亞太經合組織。

75
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Currently, there are over a hundred countries adopting CRS, with 56 of these countries already already started in January first this year.

76
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:10,980
under the OECD guidelines, all investment entities in non-adopting jurisdictions will be categorised in such a way that the controlling persons of the entity will need to be disclosed.

77
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:16,940
Okay, so the Hong Kong government has made significant efforts in enhancing the anti-money laundering and know your customers rules to be in line with international international practices.

78
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:48,530
It will also discourage other business ventures from overseas to set up operations in Hong Kong. If Hong Kong investment entities will be faced with such disclosure hurdles in opening accounts outside Hong Kong.

79
00:12:49,850 --> 00:13:08,960
Fourthly, if Hong Kong is labelled as a tax haven, then undesirable customers will be will consider setting up in Hong Kong and doing business in Hong Kong. This will further taint the reputation of Hong Kong and financial institutions in Hong Kong could face significant challenges in screening their customer base.

80
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:31,270
This is a very long-winded process. If Hong Kong does not participate in CRS, investment entities that are resident in Hong Kong will have to overcome such disclosure hurdles in opening accounts with financial institutions in other jurisdictions. This could greatly restrict the ability of Hong Kong resident investment entities.

81
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,030
謝謝，主席。

82
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,430
holders based on their residence.

83
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,200
我係今日嚟到代表香港 trustees association。

84
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,490
所以，我會 stop 這裡， and those are my our views.

85
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,210
An independent industry body representing the trusts and fiduciary services industry in Hong Kong.

86
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:13,680
好啊，下下一位就係劉家時女士，香港信託人工會嘅阿劉女士。

87
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:34,580
在促進高標準的專業ism和Corporate Governance，和進步香港作為國際金融中心。

88
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:08,590
YEOI regime will have a huge impact on the financial services sector, which the trust industry is part of.

89
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:19,040
我 just want to also before I stop also talk about maybe two other stakeholders here. The first one is the financial industry.

90
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:44,730
作為一個 trusts centre， our industry covers a wide range of trust sectors， from corporate and fund trustees， pension schemes， private trusts to charitable trusts。

91
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:59,920
The HKTA wishes to express our appreciation to the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and Internal Revenue Department for consulting with the related industries' representatives on the pending AEOI legislation.

92
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:59,290
Hat on behalf of the trust industry will continue working with FSB and RLD on the drafting of the DIP and the practice notes to provide guidance to the fund industry in accommodation to the new AEOI.

93
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:43,920
我們也想強調我們對主要信任因素的看法。對於企業信任基金，我們很高興政府、政府對HATA和基金受託人的批評已經被FSTB在擬訂法案時考慮到。

94
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:27,380
We recognise that to be a responsible international financial centre, Hong Kong must be a participant in enhancing the transparency of tax information on financial accounts of relevant persons. Therefore, the HKTA is supportive of the government on this important initiative.

95
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:39,330
金融業實際上，我認為是中立於採用CRS，因為它的要求類似於外國帳户税遵從法（FATCA）由美國在2014年引入。FATCA和CRS都要求金融機構報告帳户的金融資訊。

96
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,320
Thank you, Chairman.

97
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,660
for private trusts.

98
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,200
Working group since inception.

99
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,070
and have set on the common reporting standard.

100
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,750
Would not breach the personal data protection ordinance.

101
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,880
We thank you for the invitation to give views on the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill 2016.

102
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:40,180
The privacy commissioner must ensure that the collection of personal data, including

103
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:12,930
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Bills Committee. I am representing the Hong Kong Association of Banks.

104
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:49,210
The TIN and the DOB, the date of birth of both reportable and non-reportable control persons, as required or authorised by the IRO.

105
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:08,860
requirements for client due diligence (CDD) and reporting requirements, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and responsibilities.

106
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:19,110
The current market practices in the fund industry, according to the existing licensing regime under the SFO, should be adopted for AEOI as well.

107
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:02,590
下一位係阮漢章誒先生，香港銀行公會誒經合組織嘅共同彙報標準工作小組嘅誒，先生。

108
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:34,230
quite a bit of concern has to be addressed, but amendments to IRO need to prescribe which trust parties to do the due diligence and what are the DD requirements in relation to such parties.

109
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:32,050
PF schemes and register also schemes are included in the list of non-reporting FIs. Some of the necessary explanation on the finer details will be provided in the DIPN and we hope to work with IRD where appropriate in finalising these practice notes.

110
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:50,890
finally, we wish to stress that AEOI will have a huge impact on Hong Kong's economy as a whole, and it is of paramount importance that individual rights of confidentiality and personal data privacy are stringently safeguarded with introduction of AEOI in Hong Kong.

111
00:13:42,670 --> 00:14:02,680
The other stakeholder is what about the the account the account holder opener account holder? Well, as far as for law law abiding taxpayers is concerned, this would be no more than reporting their their income to the tax authorities, which should have been reported to in the first place.

112
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:13,920
for charitable trusts, while there is no blanket exemption for charity as such, in practice most charities will be exempted from reporting, which is which is good. For pension schemes, we are pleased that the government has taken out has taken out comments and justification in relation to retirement plans, and that.

113
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,390
呃，next January。

114
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,740
播啲粵語。

115
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,380
and it is here to stay.

116
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,560
and the fight against tax evasion.

117
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,980
而個數字係會達至約一百。

118
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,410
on tax transparency, compliance.

119
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,190
AEOI是個means to achieving it.

120
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,440
Customer financial account information changed forever.

121
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,270
and helps to protect the integrity of our financial systems.

122
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,440
This follows a raft of legislation and global initiatives.

123
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,140
在同一年，OECD發布了共同報告標準。

124
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,610
The association embraces these principles and the purposes they serve.

125
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,690
beginning of this year，over 50 jurisdiction wrote out CRS。

126
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,130
Many of these countries are business and trading partners of Hong Kong in Asia Pacific and beyond.

127
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,870
設計 to create a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial information.

128
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,610
當USFCA came into effect in two thousand fourteen， the global landscape of reporting and exchanging.

129
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,000
We have a good start.

130
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,580
和銀行 etc.

131
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,360
could be operationalised.

132
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,680
passing the bill is crucial.

133
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,900
作為一個關鍵國際金融中心。

134
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,320
to maintaining Hong Kong stature.

135
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,960
作為一個例子，彈性度的更寬廣的策略。

136
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,540
In line with the nature, size and complexity of their businesses.

137
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,640
要perform customer due diligence is necessary for banks.

138
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,030
The bill aligns with OECD CRS and provides.

139
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,690
such as customers, taxpayers, the regulators.

140
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,570
在管理的風險和 controls，和 costs of servicing customers。

141
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,090
The association appreciate the timely introduction of the bill by the government, and we support the bill.

142
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,650
provisions for optionality that the banks could take up when setting their policies and procedures.

143
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:44,170
As it seeks to promote a pragmatic and effective CRS regime in Hong Kong, by offering a framework that, in our view,

144
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:39,400
However, momentum must be maintained. It is important that the government continues to set aligned and balanced expectations amongst stakeholder groups.

145
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,940
Nevertheless.

146
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,480
Through ongoing dialogues.

147
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,910
notably，staff and the customers.

148
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,850
Peer review on Hong Kong in the near future.

149
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,670
and touches most, if not all, parts of the banks.

150
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,160
CRS implementation is complex.

151
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,270
could possibly influence the global forums.

152
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,480
一general high quality implementation outcome from the industry as a result.

153
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,810
Taxpayer have a key have key roles to play within the EUI ecosystem.

154
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,710
Further guidance on interpretation of technical matters from the IRD is crucial.

155
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:57,210
AEOICRS represent yet another burden, compliance burden for banks.

156
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,750
The association welcomes the initial steps IRD has taken in furnishing AUI information on its website.

157
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:52,210
The timetable before us is ambitious, and implementation are already underway, despite the fact that the bill is still going through its legislative process.

158
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:32,960
banks need to be ready to perform CRS customer due diligence from January next year. That is ten months away.

159
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:12,110
The DIPN, for example, is expected to play a pivotal role in helping banks apply, implement, and comply with the requirements.

160
00:21:52,730 --> 00:22:04,230
therefore, the association respectfully requests that the IRD considers adopting a soft lending approach to early enforcement and sanctions in relation to oversights within the system.

161
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
such as。

162
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,090
belief more needs to be done.

163
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,220
member banks，however。

164
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,100
and launched as soon as possible.

165
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,990
政府-led public campaigns.

166
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,770
to protect the confidentiality of all data received.

167
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,720
particularly on matters generally subject to interpretation.

168
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,260
whether from financial institutions or from EEOY partners.

169
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,070
我們是持觀點，認為這樣的宣傳活動應該是可見的、可持續的。

170
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,740
definition, self-certification, trusts and beneficiaries, compliance etc.

171
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,890
when designing, developing and delivering customer communication strategies.

172
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,510
Drawing from past experience, for example, it is of paramount importance that the banks could work with and build upon.

173
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:12,870
我們會歡迎更多細緻，在有意圖的實施方法上，政府在資訊安全。

174
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:40,550
We understand that these matters would be best addressed by relevant authorities through detailed guidelines, departmental notes and perhaps awareness campaigns.

175
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:21,220
在我們的提交中，正在被最終化，協會已識別出幾點在法案上需要釐清。

176
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:57,160
With the growing concerns around data leakage, we understand that the government intends to institute stringent controls and strict operational security measures.

177
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,140
誒。

178
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,260
We submitted.

179
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,420
these such guidance etc. should be subject to future engagement with the banking industry. In closing.

180
00:23:47,700 --> 00:24:02,160
notwithstanding these matters under discussion in the Waysman, the association support the bill's progress through electoral without delay. Thank you. 好啊，阿譚振雄先生，香港會計師公會誒税務師會執行委員。

181
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:17,920
誒個service比較effic in relation to呢個呢個implementation有呢個CIRS啊嘅時候咧，個我個offences咧係可以extend to佢哋嘅，咁呢個就誒似乎好似係有少少無辜嘅。

182
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:36,690
畀個誒税局嘅時候咧，有冇可能係一個duplicate誒個information誒maybe畀個個taxpayer本身？如果真係有發覺有錯嘅，佢可以有個mechanism去去誒呢notify懷錯或者係呢個機會去defend佢自己。

183
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:22,780
誒啊，振龍先生，誒早晨啊！首先好多謝啊梁主席同埋Build Committee嘅各位誒議員。誒，會計師公會係嘅立場咧係誒support呢個AUI嗰個legislation嘅。咁其實頭先咁多個其他嘅誒誒團體都講過咧，就係追。

184
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:42,790
主要嚟講咧，係香港唔能夠perceive to be啊一個啊密切cooperative嘅嘅jurisdiction to嗰個誒誒喺個啊transparency啊嗰方面。咁誒，特別特別打脱嘅標本身咧，噉就誒我哋同誒律局。

185
00:24:42,790 --> 00:25:02,800
亦都又不斷又又誒誒誒聯絡嘅，咁喺嗰個標本身咧就已經拍啲嘅嘢，我諗可能有兩點可能要要要研究下嘅咧，就係誒propose個section五十C三嗰度咧，就係呢單所有嘅information that will be required啊to be by

186
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:22,810
The bank to the I.O.D. to be submitted to the啊the other authority嘅噉，但係有一點就喺誒三B嘅咧，就講緊any other information that the board of income revenue specifies。咁呢個嚟講咧就變咗係比較open ended啦。即係換句嚟講咧，就係誒，如果係需要多啲。

187
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:42,820
誒資料嘅時候咧，就冇需要喺誒立法過程去話需要乜嘢咩資料。咁呢個就比較open end咧。我哋有少少話objection to呢樣嘢嘅。咁喺誒另外一個喺誒嗰個五十drop啊五十h嗰度咧，就講係可以impose個fences to個service。

188
00:25:42,820 --> 00:26:02,830
providers to F.I.咁呢個似乎嗰個extended to啊，比較係啊過分啲咁多，因因為我我哋僕阿公覺得咧，就係話，如果假如係一個啊律師或者一個會計師，或者啊甚至乎係一個computer嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅service provider provide個F.I.

189
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:38,340
噉就其其他嗰啲，我都覺得係可以喺DIPN嗰度可以誒誒deal with嘅，即係例如咧就我哋有一個observation就嗰個所謂嘅safeguard to taxpayers咧誒喺誒NXC嗰度有講咧，就話應該嚟講攞翻誒similarly applicable to誒。

190
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:58,350
C.D.T.A.同T.E.S.嘅exchange information嘅嘅準則，咁誒有一樣嘢就係誒個taxpayer本身嘅資料係畀人哋去去審議，就畀誒第二個經過I.R.D.去審議，就畀第二個tax authority。咁有冇可能係錯？

191
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:18,360
佢咧有啲information，咁喺呢個喺呢方面嚟講咧，就暫時似乎我睇唔到有乜嘢可以話係有個save格畀嗰個taxpayer知道有啲咩information係submit咗係錯嘅，或者噉我哋提議嘅就係有可能咧就將來個必誒FI畀呢個information。

192
00:27:40,160 --> 00:28:00,170
喺誒五十K呢個呢個可能係少少dropping嘅啫。喺五十K嗰度咧就係我哋發覺到咧就係話嗰個冇錯呢個目個objective呢個標就係for AEUI。咁但係似乎咧可以係extend to嗰個authority to嗰個use of information by the ILD or

193
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,640
誒。

194
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,690
即係人員嘅。

195
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,720
有關呢個。

196
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,400
本會睇法咧就有幾點嘅。

197
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,140
噉我哋嗰個會咧嘅會員咧。

198
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,350
Administration of the IO itself.

199
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,420
咁因為金融行業咧，係其實係養活好多香港嘅。

200
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,540
就我係代表澳洲護理師工會香港分會嘅。

201
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,180
Fully support呢個呢個initiative嘅，噉我想講唔多。

202
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,630
誒税務嘅誒修訂咧，就我哋。

203
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,590
大部分都係管理護理師喺各國月咧就業，特別係誒。

204
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,660
誒上市公司啊，包擔任呢個中層、高層嘅管理工作嘅。

205
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,780
眾所周知咧，香港嘅金融行業咧就係我哋嘅經濟嘅支柱，係重要嘅支柱。

206
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:57,910
好啊！啊，下一位就伍國賢先生係啊，Annie Yeh Yeh C M A Australia嘅，啊伍生。哦，多謝。誒，首先多謝主席。

207
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,770
誒。

208
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,560
就。

209
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,290
咁喺呢一方面咧。

210
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,660
即係金融嘅業務，當然咧，包括係基金公司。

211
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,710
誒本會係誒歡迎呢個税務修訂嘅，因為。

212
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,660
金融嘅公司嘅成立，就創造咧就業嘅機會。

213
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,780
呢個有啲税務咧，就變咗可以鼓勵多啲嘅。

214
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,360
咁喺呢個金融行業裏邊咧，其實我哋並非咧係。

215
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,800
誒所謂獨市嘅，我哋咧係周邊咧好多外圍競爭者嘅，例如咧係新加坡。

216
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:49,230
税務局咧可以盡早咧發出呢個税務指引，令到咧就有關相關誒。

217
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,320
噉就有關嗰個税務，如果得到通誒税務呢個修訂咧，得到通過嘅話咧，本會咧係希望咧。

218
00:30:49,630 --> 00:31:00,560
有受呢個法例影響嘅相關人士咧，就得以咧係知道係點樣係做，或者係配合税務局嗰個要求。

219
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:08,730
噉我哋個睇過呢個税誒税務嘅修訂咧，其實目的之一咧，就係要吸引咧誒多啲外資咧喺喺香港咧投資呢個。

220
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:16,160
總的嚟講咧，本會係支持呢個税務嘅修訂嘅。多謝主席。啊，多謝你，多謝七位誒團體代表咧就發言嘅。咁或者我而家請政府會唔會簡短啲回應佢啊嘛？

221
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:23,860
根本嚟講咧，就係又冇可能喺beyond啊，exchange information之外咧，係啊I.O.D可以用呢information去啊有關於本地嘅taxpayer嘅問題嘅嘅一個issue去address。咁呢個似乎係可以啊extend一個power嘅，我覺得就。

222
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:43,870
因為其實係喺税局嚟講喺五十入五十A嗰方面已經可以丟呢個metrics嘅，咁有冇需要喺呢個啊draft呢個AUI呢個proposal legislation嗰處咧，就加多啲權力畀畀税局咧？噉我覺得係冇噉嘅必要嘅。咁但係現今嚟嚟講咧，我哋都係誒工會係。

223
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:36,480
多謝主席。誒，我都想喺呢度多謝咁多位誒今日出席嘅團體啦。咁事實上當中誒不少都喺我哋去年做諮詢四月至六月諮詢嘅時候咧，我哋都有得到佢哋表達嘅寶貴意見，亦都咧係有誒同佢哋保持個溝通嘅。咁誒有幾點我都想簡單回應。

224
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:56,490
首先，我留意到咧，就在座嘅誒團體，包括亦都有寫入嚟嘅信件嘅團體咧，都誒大部分都係對於誒我哋去落實呢一個嘅自動交換資料嘅一個誒法律框架係表示支持。噉我淨係想重新咧，就係我哋事實上誒香港作為一個誒税誒一個。

225
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,880
避税天堂，以致對於營商嗰方面咧有啲不良嘅後果。

226
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,170
簡易同埋容易明白嘅一個方法咧，係向佢哋做出一個教育同宣傳嘅。

227
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:06,700
保持聯絡咧，去以備誒嗰個有關嘅細則同埋嗰個執行嘅指引。

228
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:02,420
噉啊，正話聽到啊副秘書局啊副秘書長講咧，就啊有好多啊。

229
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:56,080
有人話香港係一個逃税嘅地方，咁依啲誒，即係我哋睇到咧，都係冇冇根據嘅。

230
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:27,730
進行呢一個嘅誒自動資料交換嘅誒做法嘅誒，多謝主席。好啊，而家或者係委員嘅發問誒時間咧，誒我諗誒每人四分鐘先啦。啊，林建夫生，阿葉，多謝主席。

231
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:16,500
金融中心咧，我哋係有需要盡快咧去落實呢一套嘅誒誒資料框架啦，以便誒以便咧令到我哋咧係可以係符合個國際嘅標準，同埋咧避免咧係受到一啲國際嘅團體，包括係誒O E C D或者係歐盟嗰方面咧，係會有一啲誒將我哋係當成。

232
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:41,260
第二咧，我都留意到，剛才有團體咧都表達嗰個立法嘅時間嘅急迫性，而依樣咧，我哋都係理解嘅。事實上咧，如果要令到我哋去符合嗰個誒國際嘅承諾咧，誒，我哋係希望財務機構咧係可以喺二零一七年嘅開始咧就已經進行有關嘅嗰個盡職審查，咁所以。

233
00:32:41,260 --> 00:33:01,270
對於誒金融機構嚟講咧，事實上佢哋要去準備同埋落實嗰個嘅時間係緊迫嘅。噉我哋一定咧會喺誒處理呢一個嘅誒立法嘅程序嘅同時咧，繼續同佢哋保持聯絡啦。希望喺嗰啲執行細節啊，同埋其他一啲嘅誒字眼或者係一個細節嗰方面咧，我哋能夠同佢哋。

234
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:27,110
第三方面咧就係誒，剛才都有提到啦。事實上咧，呢一套誒落實呢一個框架咧，係需要誒有關嘅帳户持有人咧去提供資料畀金融機構，而提供資料嘅嗰個責任咧就係在於個帳户持有人。咁亦都咧係要倚仗住咧佢哋提供嗰個自我證明嘅。咁呢一，

235
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:47,120
方面咧，我哋都體察咧係需要咧做多啲嘅公眾教育嘅工作。噉我哋亦都咧係誒誒會係好樂意咧，同誒金融機構嘅組織，包括銀行公會啊、誒信託基金會啊、保險公司啊各樣咧，都去誒大家共同咧去誒舉行一啲。

236
00:33:47,120 --> 00:34:07,130
去誒教育市民嘅呢一啲嘅工作噉，當然咧所受影響嘅咧，主要就係一啲喺香港以外嘅税務居民嘅噉，但係事實上都有唔少嘅呢啲嘅人士喺香港噉，我哋需要將有關嘅譬如自我證明啊，同埋其他佢哋所需要履行嘅責任咧，我哋希望用一個簡。

237
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:32,510
最後咧，有團體都有誒，其實不少咧都有表達咧，對於嗰個保障個人資料嗰個私隱啦，同埋資料個保密性咧呢一方面個嗰個保障嘅誒訴求嘅。咁誒，我想重申一點咧，就係誒香港咧，我哋係選取咧係誒做呢一個共同匯報標準嘅前提咧。

238
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,310
行。

239
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:24,030
嘅税項嘅問題嘅，咁響處理taxresidence同埋residence tax嗰度，係咪用一個唔同嘅？

240
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:26,060
噉我哋就會參與有關嘅協議。咁但其實過去幾個月咧，我哋都睇到有其他嘅協議咧，就我哋喺香港都係做咗嘅。

241
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:54,980
時間咧，去同多個一個嘅税務管理局咧去做呢個自動資料交換。咁喺香港嚟講咧，我哋係選取一個比較有序同埋務實個方法嚟做。

242
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:16,300
咧係會預實，啊根據協議咁去處理咧。咁誒，因為依啲咧都誒牽涉到一啲誒外國人響香港嘅。

243
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:16,800
誒國際間認同嘅誒協議咧，咁香港咧就仲未參與嘅。咁依個係其中一個。咁參參誒將依一個條例草案修訂咗之後。

244
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:44,610
咁誒，依啲係咪已經足夠咧？係唔係話可以向外國嘅人士顯示？當然誒，我絕對相信誒特區政府咧係有噉嘅決心同埋能力咧，去維護我哋嘅誒金融聲譽。

245
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:52,520
我哋係希望咧，同我哋而家現時C D T A或者TIA嘅嗰啲嘅夥伴咧，係進行呢一個自動資料交換。換句説話嚟講咧，我哋會係喺個雙邊嘅嗰個嘅税務交換協定嘅嗰個嘅框架之內咧嚟做。而每一張嘅呢啲協定咧，誒喺當年咧亦都係經立法會。

246
00:34:52,520 --> 00:35:12,530
去審批當中咧，亦都咧係有一個嘅條款咧，羅列咗有關嘅資料保障啦，誒同埋個個人資料嘅嗰個嘅誒確保個私隱咧不被侵犯嘅呢啲嘅保障措施嘅。咁所以我哋咧係希望喺呢個框架之下嚟進行咧，以確保咧我哋係能夠選取合適嘅夥伴嚟。

247
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:48,030
香香港一路以嚟咧都係評為一個最自由嘅地方嘅。噉啊，響貿易啊、金融貿易啊啊等等咧啊，都係國際上邊咧都有一個好高嘅評價嘅。咁近幾年咧就我哋時不時都聽到咧就有。

248
00:36:44,890 --> 00:37:04,900
啊，税務上咧，亦都係一一向都好公開嘅，用一個公平、公正、公開嘅態度去處理嘅。噉啊，但係啊，每每當有一啲法例啊推出嚟嗰陣時咧，啊有事發生嗰陣時，或者啊市民又好啊。

249
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:24,910
金融機構又好，有事發生嗰陣時咧，啊，有啲人似乎就唔係好明白啊法例嘅內容啊。噉啊，響啊宣傳嗰方邊咧啊，我覺得除咗係向有關機構，例如啊今日嚟表達意見嘅啊專業機構之外咧。

250
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:44,920
即係市民咧，其實都係需要多啲喺呢一方面瞭解嘅。啊，正話亦都有誒，我哋嘅嘉賓提出咧話誒，可唔可以做多一啲宣傳咧？咁喺呢一方面，你哋有啲咩安排咧？嗱，咁另外啊，正話你都有提到咧，啊，副秘書長都有提到咧，就私人嗰方面嗰個平衡。

251
00:37:45,590 --> 00:38:05,600
其實好多人都好擔心啦，啲資料畀咗你哋之後，畀咗税務局之後，税務局畀咗有關嘅誒協議嘅國家去到嗰邊咧，啲資料唔知去邊㗎啦。噉啊，依依個點樣可以誒向我哋有一個保證啊？依啲係會誒對方。

252
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,950
個成本增加呢兩樣嘢。

253
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,710
第二咧，嗯，我就想知道其實誒。

254
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:22,480
國際嘅標準，咁所以喺呢一方面咧，我哋非常認同要多做功夫。嗯，喺我哋呢一個條例草案。

255
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:02,060
税局咧喺執行過往呢啲税務資料交換嘅表現係點樣樣嘅？多謝主席。好啊，阿梁繼昌議員。

256
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:33,960
講咧有一個類似噉樣樣嘅準則，而喺外地咧亦都有相類似一啲居住嘅嗰個嘅準則嚟到去評定嘅。咁呢個我諗我哋要多做功夫，同埋多翻強調。

257
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:23,090
嗰個data，我哋由香港send出嚟嘅data有啲乜嘢嘅保障？即係話你哋會唔會？嗱，我知道會會交咗畀税局先嘅個data。咁喺嗰個保安方面，即係我想知道你哋有啲咩計劃。嗱，雖則我知道而家都可能係太早問呢個問題。

258
00:43:45,310 --> 00:44:04,250
啊，DTA嘅一啲國家要求翻咧攞翻香港居民嘅一啲嘅資料咧嗱，噉就呢三個問題咧，咁第一第一，我想問一問，真係誒嗰個data flow，即係如果香港係誒進行咗自動税務資料交換嘅時候。

259
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:44,320
誒處理方法咧，因為都係一樣同埋一個處誒相同嘅處理方法咧。誒，秘書長，好多謝主席，多謝啊，議員嘅提問嘅。咁誒，我聽到有大概有四方面。就住第一方面咧，對於香港咧去履行國際喺税務事宜嗰方面嘅標準咧，我想指出嘅就係過去我哋。

260
00:38:44,320 --> 00:39:04,330
得立法會同意誒，我哋進行一個誒資料，純粹係税務資料交換，即係TIA嘅協定嘅嗰個立法草案咧，係令到我哋喺誒資料交換嗰方面咧，係誒邁進一步咧，去以變符合咗國際嗰個標準。咁誒而家喺議員嘅誒誒所。

261
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:24,340
審批嘅呢一個嘅條例草案，所處理嘅關於誒財務帳户嘅税務資料自動交換咧，係誒OECD最新落實嘅標準。咁誒，我哋事實上如果係誒能夠通過呢一條嘅條例法案咧，我哋得到誒OECD同埋個誒税務透明嘅嗰

262
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:44,350
個嘅誒Global Forum所認同咧，就係我哋會符合到嗰個國際標準嘅。只不過咧，我都想帶出就係而家世界嘅趨勢咧，有不少嘅税務管轄區咧，佢哋會選擇咧係用一個多邊嘅形式，甚至咧佢哋會簽訂一個多邊嘅税務協作嘅一個協定咧，係去一同一。

263
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:15,620
第二咧，對於市民教育嗰方面咧，我非常之認同，就係誒，我哋喺誒税務誒呢一方面嘅嗰個嘅誒資料嘅標準咧，事實上係每一年咧都發展係一日千里嘅。香港咧，其實都有花好大嘅氣力咧，去一不停咧噉樣去跟進翻緊隨住各。

264
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:42,770
遞交嚟立法會嘅同時咧，我哋都有喺誒税務局嘅網頁上邊咧，去提出一啲比較簡單易明嘅一啲嘅F A Q咧。當然係話我哋仍然呢一樣咧係尚待審批嘅喺立法會。咁但係我哋最希望咧係要去讓公眾能是能夠掌握到咧呢一套嘅誒嘅標準咧，其實。

265
00:40:42,770 --> 00:41:02,780
涉及同埋影響嘅係啲咩人？呢度可以帶佢哋。最後，你提嗰條問題就係關於嗰個嘅誒tax residents。我哋係會多翻強調咧誒呢個涉及要交換嘅資料咧，係同一啲香港以外嘅税務居民所有關。而個税務居民嘅呢個定義喺個條。

266
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:22,790
例裏邊咧，我哋都有清楚定明咧，係以居於嗰個地方，而居於或者位於嗰個地方咧，一般而言咧，係以當地嗰個法律咧，以佢喺譬如喺一年之內誒居住超過半年以上啦，或者係連續兩個嘅誒平歲嘅年度咧，係超過三百日。咁香港。

267
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:54,670
第三咧都係去翻嗰個私隱嗰個嘅問題啦。誒，當然除咗我剛才提到喺嗰啲税務協定裏邊誒個框架咧，有啲條款咧係去限制嗰個資料交換嘅時候去確保個保密性之外咧，我哋當然認為呢一個誒唔唔會係足夠嘅。我哋其實咧係需要咧都要。

268
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,120
就。

269
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,980
資料啦，三個問題，唔該，主席。

270
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,770
係嘛？或啊，先生。

271
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,570
有邊位可以答？

272
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,870
第三點，我就想問翻誒財經事務副務局。

273
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,830
個實際情況就係話，每一間銀行唔同，因為佢自己嘅。

274
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,220
Factor同AUI嗰個性質係相似。

275
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,500
Hello，啊，根據普遍嘅嗯經驗。

276
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,500
咁主要，如果做compliance嘅，又應該係響customer due diligence。

277
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:40,920
誒多謝呢個問題啦。就根據，我聲少少麻煩，唔該。根據普遍。

278
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,410
啊，FCA就check US-specific persons啦，咁CRS AEO就check呢個tax residence，就利用呢個。

279
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:24,210
或者畀與會者答答你第二個問題。誒，大家對你哋而家factor嘅compliance裏邊，你哋嘅成本有冇啲資料可以話畀議員聽？

280
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:40,110
client base唔同，咁如果係多啲foreign嘅嘅嘅account holders咧，噉佢要做嘅compliance assurance嘅work就會增加，嚇，噉就所以。

281
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:45,150
而家如果做自動税務資料交換嘅時候，或者與會者都可以講一講，同你哋而家好多機構做緊factor嘅compliance，實質上你哋個成本啊或者時間會唔會多咗好多？呢個我想知嘅。

282
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:14,680
要誒去參詳翻咧，過往我哋簽咗税務協定嘅嗰啲夥伴咧，佢個track record，即係所謂佢喺佢當地嗰個立法嘅框架啦，同埋佢執行嘅時候誒，有冇去秉承翻呢啲保障資料嗰個私隱嘅佢嗰個嘅誒經驗同埋佢嗰個表現咧係點樣？而事實上我哋得。

283
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:34,690
知咧，誒O.E.C.D.GlobalForum嗰邊咧，已經咧係誒走準備走訪咧，所有全球參與咗呢一個標準嘅國家同埋税務管轄區，發放咗一係列嘅問卷單張咧，包括香港在內。我哋最近亦都填報咗咧一份咧驗身報告啊，去睇翻我哋喺。

284
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:54,700
保障資料啊，同埋執行呢啲國際標準嗰個嘅表現如何？而喺度順帶一提咧，點解嗰個時間同埋個需要咁急迫性咧？就係誒Global Forum已已經預備喺二零一七年咧進行開始進行個相互評估，佢哋會喺今年嘅四月咧都會派員咧嚟香港咧去審視翻。

285
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:22,470
啊，多謝主席。誒，我諗誒，今日大部分嘅與會者都贊成呢一個嘅誒條例草案個方向，雖然亦都有部分嘅與會者都擔心個私隱嘅問題，啊，同埋執行嘅時候係咪會即係令到嗰啲誒金融機構咧係嗰？

286
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:45,240
咁亦都有朋友亦都帶出咗，喂，究竟如果一啲香港嘅居民佢係定居咗外地嘅時候，即係香港嘅税務局亦都會唔會要求誒外地嘅金融機構，即係簽咗當然簽咗呢個誒税務資料交換協議，或者係個。

287
00:44:50,240 --> 00:45:10,250
或者税局喺政策上，你哋會唔會要求啊外國嘅金融機構啊攞香港税務居民？但係香港税務居民呢樣其實係喺我哋嘅本地嘅税務條例台冇咩叫咩税務居民呢樣嘢㗎嘛？係咪香港？你會唔會實質上會唔會要求佢哋攞香港居民嘅？

288
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:23,700
咁性質類似，但係個步驟當然唔同，咁所以個經驗可以leverage，咁但係就實際嘅工作就係分開嘅，咁所以係，咁當然啦，頭先我嘅誒presentation就係話佢個compliance burden係會增加，咁但係增加幾多，咁要睇實際整。

289
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,240
好啊，或者誒，Mr. Henderson。

290
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:14,410
好啊！誒，政府為咗答埋誒梁議員第一、第二、三條問題。

291
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:56,720
咁嗰啲又係唔同嘅，咁所以好多好難概括而論。咁但係就可以借fact嘅經驗。

292
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:49,100
嗯，呢個當然係睇個個scale同埋個品種。咁如果佢係特別多institution嘅客同係個人嘅客。

293
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:09,730
這項提案，和履行我們作為國際公民的義務，致力於幫助根除逃税。

294
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:17,760
好啊，或者有冇其他議會成員想？想啊，補充下咧，就啊喺Faker嗰度嘅情況咧，我係細會計師都吸埋cross到嘅咧，就係而家銀行一般咧就叫個客户啊，理公去去啊IRS嘅web去攬啊，what the form啦，咁攞個form成日咧嗰種form係非。

295
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:37,770
非常之complicated嘅，即係即係我嚟講，我自己as an accountant都有having problem。咁好好舉例先，譬如我有個客户噉，其實佢咧就係誒唔係美國居民，乜都唔係嘅。咁但係原來咧，佢個BI公司咧就有個疏叫self account噉樣嚇。咁原來哦。

296
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:57,780
啲人咧嗰嗰間B.V.I公司咧變咗係一個F.I本身㗎，噉我都唔知嘅。咁原來呢就當一個好似passive investment嚟睇。咁原來個B.V.I公司咧要去register嘅。咁咁呢方面嚟講咧，我諗係啊希望咧就係啊就implement嘅時候咧，慢慢去去借助喺factor嘅經驗嚟。咁

297
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:17,790
依家真係factor都啱啱開始，冇幾耐嘢噉就係呢啲咁所謂叫做誒初步嘅階段啲嘢，可能有好多誒un unforeseen到嘅mistake係係honest mistake by the taxpayer，或或者by嗰個所謂嗰個誒誒professional service provider嘅嚇。

298
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:40,610
Chairman, if I may, the data that's described in the pools that I, in the diagrams that you have with you, no amount of clauses in legislation or agreements is going to provide adequate protection of that data. That is just the plain simple fact.

299
00:48:40,610 --> 00:49:00,620
在數位世界，所以我認為，我們需要做的是認識那，並説：，什麼？我們可以做？答案是減少那數據，可以被遺失、偷竊和濫用，到最低限度，讓我們可以忠實地實施。

300
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:34,790
誒就住第一條問題咧，關於嗰個嘅誒資料交換嘅時候個保密個系統咧。誒，我想簡單講一講誒，跟住我請税局或者講一講。其實誒喺誒我哋香港呢邊嘅税務當局同埋我哋到時交換嘅夥伴嘅税務當局咧，就會大家之間咧係有一個保密嘅。

301
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:54,800
嘅一個嘅系統嘅portal。咁事實上，而家O E C D咧都設計咗一啲，畀咗一啲template啦，同埋畀咗一啲指引啦，就係就住嗰個資料個保密性同埋嗰個系統嘅嗰個保密性咧，點樣去做嗰啲措施同埋功夫。咁誒，税務局咧就當然而家我哋嘅着力咧，主要集中喺個條例同埋做個指引。

302
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,760
噉樣先可以睇得到嘅。

303
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:53,160
佢係需要咧重新交入嚟嘅，噉就唔能夠話我攞翻我再去改，唔會係噉嘅程序嘅。

304
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:45,740
攞到嗰啲賬户資料嘅，即係換句講，即使一間金長輩機構需要更改佢嘅資料咧。

305
00:52:51,370 --> 00:53:00,390
嗰啲誒帳户持有人嘅資料咧，喺第日第二交個報税表過程之中，我哋需要係加密嘅，即係簡單嚟講，有個密碼。

306
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:43,470
亦我哋喺每日日日子咧，會聽取大家嘅意見，睇邊方面可以更加改善嘅。無求咧，就係希望咧嗰個保物個標準可以達到嘅。

307
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:17,750
咁要用簽證咧，亦都係用個電子簽證，我哋英語上就叫digital signature嘅。咁咧，digital signature咧，嗰個財務機構會有一有一組啦，咁最好有一組，要兩組嘅聲明書先可以睇到裏邊嘅賬户啦。

308
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:31,050
係喺UI on request嘅法律框架嘅嗰啲嘅步驟咧，嚟到去進行，同呢一個咧係分開嘅。主席，我好問嘅問題係：香港特區政府會唔會主動去向簽署咗即係誒税雙邊税務資料交換條款嘅國家？

309
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:14,810
噉，但係另一邊咧，佢哋亦都有一個專責嘅隊伍咧，就係去發展呢一方面個系統。我哋好好好可能咧，亦都會係借咗緊而家咧喺海外佢哋，因為喺二零一七咧將會有一批先鋒者去做嘅一啲國家，譬如英國啊，或者一啲歐美國家。噉佢哋咧應該會係先設立咗一啲噉樣嘅。

310
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:34,820
資料交換嘅系統，噉我哋會參考同借鏡嘅。咁誒，最後第三條問題咧，誒阿阿梁議員有提到，就係話，對於香港嘅税務居民，我哋咧亦都會唔會要求海外嘅嗰啲嘅誒財務機構去咧去取誒索取呢一啲香港税務居民嘅資料？我想。

311
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:54,830
強調咧，就係而家呢一套A E O I嘅框架咧，係根據呢一個定名嘅財務帳户資料嘅嗰個框架嚟嚟做嘢。如果誒喺呢一個框架之下咧，當地嘅税務當局咧唔會將呢啲資料咧再轉去，亦都唔可以咧轉去第三者，包括當地嘅財務機構。至於喺當地嘅税，

312
00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:14,840
税務當局，佢哋誒會唔會喺之後再需要喺佢哋個法例執行嘅時候，需要去索取翻同香港一啲税務居民有關嘅咧？呢個會沿用翻而家喺E.O.I. on request，即係喺經要求下所索取資料嘅嗰個渠道嚟做，而每一個嘅個案咧，亦都要跟翻咧之前我哋。

313
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:51,340
去攞香港税務居民嘅資料，即係會唔會做呢個request？我我問會唔會？其實一個政策嘅問題。李處長嚇。誒，我諗或者我可以噉樣答啦。我哋唔冇話喺一個政策層面咧要求要噉樣樣做。咁但係咧就誒，事實上税務局咧。

314
00:51:51,340 --> 00:52:11,350
咧，佢哋喺評税啊，或者係去誒誒做調查嘅時候，佢哋當然係可以運用佢哋所有嘅權力，而因應嗰個個案所需咧，去索取有關嘅資料。噉我諗就住呢一度，或者頭先剛才提到嗰個系統嗰度咧，或者我請啊税局嘅趙生去補充。啊，税務局嘅，好多謝。

315
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:31,360
主席誒，就嗰個自動誒資料交換嗰個系統，或者我略略咁講，税務局嘅初步構思啦。因為整個系統都喺一個開發嘅階段過程之中嘅。咁誒，第一點咧，就所有要需要申報嘅財務機構咧，就

316
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:51,370
就呢個智能資料交換咧，係需要離税局咧設立一個賬户嘅電子賬户嘅。咁所有嘅誒通訊咧都要係透過呢個賬户進行嘅。基本上咁個好處係咩咧？因為所有嘢咧就可以會係更加容易進行保密嘅，尤其是。

317
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:51,910
成本係一樣會增加嘅，就唔會話做一件嘢咧，就等於幾多件？呢個一個情況。

318
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:11,510
另一個外地嘅税務管理區咧，亦都會將有關香港居民嘅資料，係交翻畀香港税務局嘅。

319
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:46,920
誒不方便咧，等等，可唔可以提供畀大家知道？咁同埋當局宣傳，頭先我都聽到誒。

320
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:22,010
困難有冇咩誒喺合作處理呢一次誒嘅？包括我哋嘅税務安排嘅有關嘅立法。

321
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:28,540
多謝主席。誒，首先亦都多謝今日嚟參與誒，即係我哋呢個標琴嘅誒提供意見嘅各位業界啊，同埋有關專業界別嘅朋友。

322
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:38,530
如果我哋時間上誒係咪都係好適合？中間咧會唔會你哋預計？如果誒快啊慢啊等等咧，有冇啲所謂叫誒後備方案？即係如果萬一慢咗，又有冇咩誒引起嘅？

323
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:45,750
誒，聽咗咁多意見咧，我都係同剛才好多有啲類似，不都應該表達一下嘅。首先咧，呢個整個税務修訂條例裏邊咧，都係涉及到一個國際性，即係逐步係。

324
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:38,420
咁而家初步嘅構思就話咧，誒或者用一個簡單嘅觀念咧，就話簡單嚟講，資料咧就有入冇出嘅，即係換句嚟講咧，你畀得我，你係冇機會攞翻走嘅。呢個噉嘅道，呢個政策，呢個觀念上嘅好處咧，就可以杜絕咧任何情況之下有人咧非法咧喺税務局嗰度咧。

325
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:13,450
咁另外一點咧，我要指出咧，國際上咧，其實呢個都係經合法組織咧，佢哋主導嘅，噉就會有一個咧國際嘅平台嘅，亦都係相據我哋理解，都係會要求好高嘅格調去保密嘅。咁呢個平台咧，亦只係有關税務嘅當局參與咗資料交換嘅，先可以。

326
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:33,460
去一度嘅平台，而呢個平台咧就係簡單嚟講，税務局咧就透過呢個平台同外國嘅税務機關咧係進行資料交換嘅。所有資料亦都會係加密先可以進行嘅。咁咧，我希望誒議員同委員會都誒留意到咧，其實呢個保密咧係我哋税務嗰個工作一個最重要嘅環節嘅。

327
00:54:43,750 --> 00:55:03,760
噉就最拉尾香港税務居民嗰一點第三條嘅題目咧，其實因為一般嚟講，我哋嘅税務協議咧，同埋嗰個税務資料交換嘅協議咧，都係一個雙邊性嘅，即係換句講，你噉樣對我，我亦都會噉樣對你。所以喺過程之中咧，香港方面交出資料畀一個外國税務管理區咧。

328
00:55:46,030 --> 00:56:06,040
誒大膽講句咧，就係都係好多誒喺利益上邊嘅，如何去誒提升？即係好多國家喺各方面嘅所謂誒想取得啊，取得一個你話係咪誒喺監透過監管而得到更多嘅？

329
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:26,220
誒爭取唔好漏咗任何利益咧，依啲噉樣嘅做法咧，都我相信都係陸續即係陸續都會誒會係誒嚴格咗嘅。咁但係同時咧，亦都係做到使到行業咧誒，可能個成本最終即係都係。

330
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:46,230
去到轉嫁到或者係引起翻咧，都係畀翻呢個客户承擔，或者呢啲機構咧，係佢嘅利潤方面咧就會適量咧就被縮窄，咁呢個都係一個結果嚟嘅。咁所以咧，我哋希望咧，呢一樣嘢嘅即係增加咗呢個呢。

331
00:56:46,230 --> 00:57:06,240
呢啲類型嘅一啲所謂叫資料嘅交換咧，都係要避免咗嚇，避免誒嗰個成本增加太快。所以第一點咧就係個系統咧、人員培訓咧、客户嘅誒，仲要宣傳啦，因為要解釋畀客户聽啦，啊以及審查嘅事。

332
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:12,970
五兩食完。

333
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,480
即係加重咗好大嘅監管嘅壓力同埋成本。

334
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:57,900
最後咧就係話執行執行嘅時候咧，誒有冇一個適量嘅檢討嘅？

335
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:28,340
做好件事，因為面對住國際嘅嗰個評估咧，唔係淨係税局嘅問題，係要得到全部財務機構嗰個合作，同埋佢理解嗰個嘅做法咧，先至能夠有效實施嘅。

336
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:36,160
係將好幾個嘅呢啲國際性嘅誒合作性嘅一啲規則咧，就做一啲檢討啊，畀啲時間做一檢討。咁最終咧一點咧就係話，如果處罰即係被國際其他機構處罰嘅時候，

337
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:26,250
後嘅嚴格性咧，具體操作未來嘅資料交換嘅一啲所謂操作上邊嘅誒嚴防失誤啊，呢啲噉嘅問題咧，噉我覺得呢個都會可能係誒各個機構，包括銀行機構咧，都要承擔好多增加咗嘅誒工作。

338
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:46,260
物成本咁呢點咧？希望咧亦都係大家應該要互互相嘅體諒，即係監管當局應該知道啊！呢呢類嘅成本，頭先講就算税務美國嘅税務嘅資料提供啊等等咧，要開始咗之後咧，我相信都唔係話誒其他繼續增加嘅話，就類似嘅成。

339
00:57:52,190 --> 00:58:12,200
第二咧就係我想知道咧就係各方面咧，即係多方嘅合作咧，要需要好多誒，即係國際嘅誒之間啊嘅合作咧，係咪喺時間控制上，即係我哋本港咧啊，同相關嗰啲地區等等嘅誒，有冇咩？

340
00:58:47,200 --> 00:59:07,210
有關嘅同誒誒嘅行業咧，都提到包括銀行業都係都希望咧，就喺宣傳方面咧，就唔係單靠銀行自己啦。啊，如果係政府因為推出呢啲係國際性嘅要求咧，能夠做啲宣傳咧，令至到客户覺得呢個唔係銀行單方面嘅要求，係一個國際需要。

341
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:27,220
係一個誒所謂增加咗成本又好，或者增加咗佢嘅麻煩都好咧，都係一個配合或者一個符合國際嘅進進一步嘅需要。對唔住主席，我提供多少少嘅建議添啊。就另外喺監管方面咧，頭先我都好同意咧，就係係逐步逐步，特別有啲。

342
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:47,230
開始嘅時候有啲誤點咧，即係有啲錯誤嘅嘅嘅處理咧。希望咧有彈性嘅處理，避免監管當局同呢個啊呢個行業之間咧，由因為呢啲噉嘅新增嘅情況咧，產生太多嘅誒無無需要嘅，或者係產生更更多嘅最即。

343
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:18,380
嘅計劃，或者一個一個檢討嘅誒機制，因為而家陸續呢啲噉樣嘅國際性嘅監管嘅問題咧啊，包括啲國際嘅誒誒呢啲資本控制啊等等一啲比例嘅監控咧，都好多嘅噉，所以可唔可以喺適當時間咧？

344
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:56,450
誒政府嘅監管當局會唔會扮演某一類嘅角色去參與瞭解同埋協助咧？咁好啊，好啊。誒，比上簡單啲盤答。多謝阿吳議員提出咧，好幾個都好有誒關聯同埋好誒誒合理嘅一個提法。誒喺合規成本嗰方。

345
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:16,460
方面咧，打從我哋做諮詢開始咧，我哋都唔低估誒財務機構喺呢方面需要做嘅合規嘅嗰個嘅困難同埋成本嘅。咁誒，我哋喺成個嘅立法嘅精神就係用一個務實，同埋係慢慢慢慢做，有序咁做，雙邊噉樣樣做。咁所以咧，我哋係盡

346
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:36,470
量都係希望咧，喺我哋要符合呢一個誒共同彙報標準嘅前提下咧，睇下有邊啲方面，我哋盡量係可以將嗰個嘅合規成本嘅影響或者嗰個困難咧，可以係慢慢慢慢噉樣去適應，同埋將嗰個影響儘量咧去誒減低啦。

347
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,600
我啊，做緊新業。

348
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,550
啊啊啊！演出。

349
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,630
可以提供啲答案。

350
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,060
咁所以呢方面咧，我哋會誒參詳佢哋提供嘅一啲嘅誒意見。

351
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:11,940
即係會一句嘅同誒你哋嘅發言啦噉樣。咁其實咧，我就誒想誒問一問咧，就噉樣。

352
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:11,720
噉我想問咧，你哋所理解啊，或者你哋所理解個法例誒？而家呢套通過之後咧。

353
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:04,350
啊！嗰啲transaction啊，即係嗰啲嗰啲誒誒，即係誒交易啊嗰啲咧，就會誒喺度嘅噉。

354
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:46,830
第二咧就係你哋咧，因為係有嗰個人誒，同佢係誒誒客户啦嚇，即係啊，一定客户啦噉。

355
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:05,350
誒主席，就誒我好多謝誒即係出席嘅誒誒業界啦。咁誒其實我一路即係遲咗個，但係我一路揸車都一路聽住。

356
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:56,710
咁咧就佢就有好多財務嘅出出出入入啊，誒或者係誒誒相關嘅資料咧。

357
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:24,600
因為咧，而家咧就政府立咗條例啦，噉我就想問業界咧，不如你要遵守嘅時候咧，誒究竟嗰個標準啊，或者點樣咧，會唔會有啲咩誒情況咧？噉樣，我想問一問。但因為咧，

358
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:44,470
點解你明明佢buy passport free啦？咁點解你話佢佢話冇passport噉，你唔問佢咧？噉啊，即係去到幾細節，你誒所理解，你哋自我理解嗰個責任去到幾高咧？

359
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:38,250
誒最基本咧就係誒誒，我我覺得有兩個角度，一個角度咧就係嗰個人咧就填一啲誒資料，OK，即係就係去報嘅一啲資料啦，或者誒去分析嘅資料。

360
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:23,370
啊！呢啲嘢咧，可能要交佢㗎噉。呢個一陣間，我哋會再同政府嗰邊討論咧，所謂叫第一層執法咧，第二層執法嘅問題。我上一次講就即係可能咧啊。噉啊，我想先問一問業界裏邊，你你點樣理解係你哋嘅個職責去到邊一個層次咧？噉樣好啊！業界有邊位？

361
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:56,480
但係當然，我哋都明白咧。剛才頭先都有團體表達到，雖然而家我哋都係做緊嗰個誒美國嘅海外帳户嗰個合規嘅法案啦。誒嗰個嘅系統同程序咧會相類似嘅，個經驗會相類似。咁但係因為去攞取嘅嗰啲資料咧，始終有所不同。咁所以咧，我哋都會喺呢。

362
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:16,490
一方面咧，誒誒，税局咧已經係同各個誒財務機構咧有表達過。當嗰個框架落實之後咧，我哋係會咧去走訪啲財務機構。其實我哋會係希望有一個協作嘅方式咧，誒多過係一個去監管佢、去處罰佢哋嘅嘅做法。我哋會走訪，希望咧係大家共同。

363
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:48,790
時間嗰方面啦，誒的，而且確係好緊迫嘅。誒，議員提到有冇後備方案啦？誒，我相信咧呢一方面咧，我我必須要指出咧，我哋所面對嘅嗰個誒誒個時間嘅嗰個嘅緊密嘅情況咧，係好難有一個所謂後備方案。咁但係誒，我哋其實都希望嘅咧。

364
01:02:48,790 --> 01:03:08,800
就係，如果我哋要達到個國際嘅承諾，話喺二零一八年之前做到第一次嘅資料自動交換咧，我哋就要期望喺誒今個立法年度落實框架之後咧，隨而咧要誒物識到一個我諗至少一個合適嘅夥伴，而務求能夠喺二零一七年之前。

365
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:28,810
咧就同當嗰個夥伴咧去簽呢一張嘅誒協定，咁所以我哋希望嘅做法就係至少揾到一個啦。咁而我哋揾呢個夥伴嘅時候咧，除咗去考慮佢嗰啲誒保密同埋佢立法嘅嗰個嘅誒標準之外咧，我哋會係徵詢團體。

366
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:48,820
嘅意見誒，業界嘅意見，睇下邊一個夥伴對於我哋嗰個嘅貿易有利啦，亦都咧係能夠喺佢哋去誒落實嗰套系統同埋程序，佢哋要去辨識嗰啲客户、帳户、客户嘅時候咧，嗰個夥伴選取嘅時候咧，都其實都會對佢哋有啲影響嘅。

367
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:32,030
你哋係需要好積極咁去差唔多誒翻箱倒籠噉啊，或者咧誒睇下佢誒，就算佢話冇passport噉啊，佢點解會咁多呢啲咩交易啊？誒，甚至咧就誒可能咧有一個entry咧，原來咧就係誒electronic咁交一個passport fee咁噉啊啊，要你睇到噉。

368
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,660
根據。

369
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:01,910
要求畀嘅資料。

370
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,640
噉，譬如我哋個。

371
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,970
咁當然咧，佢填翻翻嚟。

372
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,840
嘅補習，而完成之後咧。

373
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,720
係基本上係誒唔會開户口嘅。

374
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,050
而我哋做咗一個叫做Reasonable Test。

375
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,560
咁當然check就係根據銀行現有嘅資料。

376
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:59,190
多數呢啲資料都係喺個system入邊嘅，search electronically searchable嘅資料。

377
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:48,570
就要去check check佢係係唔係香港啲UI partners個country嘅tax residents。

378
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:39,050
噉就呢個標嘅requirement之下咧，就有一至兩年嘅時間咧，睇下你個户口嘅銀碼係幾多啦，個balance。

379
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:25,230
個標嘅requirements啊，其實就係會做一個同類嘅reasonable test，就係睇下佢同現有嘅資料吻唔吻合。

380
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:10,440
咁如果發覺要需要去問個客人嘅話咧，噉我哋就要佢做一個cell certification。其實同新嘅客係一樣嗰嗰嗰個form嘅。

381
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:59,600
咁喺而家呢個標嘅requirements之下咧，同國際一樣嘅，即係基本上就係如果佢做冇做足呢個self certification。

382
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:28,690
咁呢一個就係嘅呢個基本嘅嘅步驟。咁至於你話誒，sorry，我唔係講開唔開户口，而係講交啲資料。譬如你你你現有嘅客户點咧？啊，咁呢個就係開户口啦。咁如果現有嘅客户咧？

383
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:47,940
誒多謝陶議員嘅問題啦，就或者將個咪擺近少少。多謝陶議員嘅問題，就關於個責任咧，就我諗相對嚟講，就係響新分開新開户後嘅customer，即係客人，同埋現有嘅客人。

384
01:05:44,750 --> 01:06:04,760
啊！幾低咧？抑或係其實就好簡單，你填阿Sir，你填啦啊！你填乜嘢，我咪交畀税局乜嘢啊？噉啊，總言之，如果有咩事噉啊，你負責咯，係嘛咁噉啊？你哋咧其實咧，基本上係minimum啊，佢交嚟啊。咁當然你可能提下佢，話阿Sir，你你你填啊，小心啲啊！

385
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,460
啊！

386
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,350
慢啦。

387
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,400
好啊！阿阿譚生。

388
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,260
呢個就係現有嘅規規例。

389
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:29,880
即係嗰個就係Hong Kong A M A規定之下睇嘅。

390
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:43,890
expectation咧就係亦都同國際一樣啦，就係列名。

391
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:35,150
個file話佢有好似有五個地址唔同國家嘅，咁可能佢真係有五個唔同嘅tax residence嘅countries。

392
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:43,730
噉我哋就需要問一問，嚇噉，但係佢簽咗名之後咧，就呢個就會作實㗎啦個certification。

393
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:25,580
噉就有一個程序，就可能會需要一個enhanced嘅due diligence。咁嗰度就會睇現有KYC同埋AML嘅資料嘅啫。

394
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:14,110
但係有有某類嘅客，譬如係多過所謂high value account就多過一個million美金嘅，香港就係七百八十。

395
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:19,300
咁但係你見佢好可能用你嗰度有一個transaction就轉錢，其中一個或者誒誒credit account啊，就然後咧交咗五十磅啊，即係passport fee噉樣。

396
01:08:47,980 --> 01:09:05,380
主席，我幫佢跟進一個簡單。誒，或者畀誒你跟進咧，你跟進。好簡單。我我意思係噉啊，即係話咧，你哋所理解咧，舉個例，我就先舉個例啦。就譬如佢明明話佢冇誒嗰個U.I.跟住，即係嗰個交換國家嘅誒叫國民身份啦。啊噉。

397
01:09:44,170 --> 01:10:03,610
有六樣嘢我哋會望嘅，會睇嘅電話地址啦，啊諸如此類啦，同埋有啲啊standing instructions啊，嚇咁除咗呢啲之外咧，我哋唔會話去特登去抄佢個花話頭先話成日要交學費嗰度啊，或者係諸如此類嘅嚇噉。

398
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:39,650
即係去到噉啊？或例如好簡單，譬如你話佢佢佢冇乜都冇嘅嘛？啊佢成日就交呢個誒誒西班牙嘅某間屋嘅電費啊差響喎噉。即係你去唔去到你哋要做到噉樣search？即係你噉樣嘅意思啊？即係我意思啊？嘅分析然後再再分析嘅，我唔使嘅，因為個誒個標嘅。

399
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:54,520
其實之前咧都同啊啊税局啊交換意見嘅時候都提過，就最主要嚟講嗰個resident嗰個test咧就問題啲輸啦。個resident本身咧係根據你個fact。O.K.噉你你學我學學户口嘅時候，可能我係舉個例先，我係加拿大居民，噉我咪declare我加拿大居民咧噉。

400
01:10:54,700 --> 01:11:14,710
咁但係有個possibility係我三年之後我係become一個nonresident加拿大嘅喎，咁點咧噉樣？咁所以個education係好重要啦，即係我呢啲我銀行冇責任去為你而家唔係nonresident嘅啦喎，咁噉你你你可唔可以可唔可以除咗你係要嗰個taxpayer自己本身去notify嘅銀行或者同樣。

401
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,290
嘅誒definition of香港税務居民。

402
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:18,960
同樣反應嚟講，譬如我係拿士寧嘅，安生嚟，我必給一個。

403
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:26,980
個tax residence，佢話佢係法國tax residence，我哋就會接受，就唔會去偵去探下佢係咪有搣嗰個法國嘅residence嘅tax嘅。

404
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:41,100
咁誒業界有冇一啲嘅誒可能畀到一啲誒市民一啲指引咧？嗱兩個問題咧，主席唔該，兩邊都可以答。或誒或者。

405
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:45,430
啊，唔該，主席，我想問一問咧，嗯，喺嗯而家呢一個草案入邊咧，係有exemption嘅嘛？financial，某些financial institution，咁呢個exemption同factor嗰個exemption會唔會係類相類似？第一個問題。

406
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:38,420
對方嘅第係其他國家居民，我可能唔知嘅，銀行亦都唔知嘅。咁呢方面嚟講咧，係誒有冇一個make嘅

407
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:58,710
同同fact係先，唔同fact就係因為係basic citizen㗎嘛，或者basic你係咪green card嘛，咁好clear啦。咁但係就resident比較係有少少嘅困難嘅呢方面嚟講就哇，劉女士你係咪想答？冇啊，即係佢講我哋，我哋trustees都需要做呢啲噉嘅work，unrelevant。

408
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:18,720
account，即係我哋同M誒經政府一直都講嘅咧，我哋唔係做偵探，所以好清楚，好似同我Hong Kong I B一樣，我哋會用reasonable，我有咩data，我collect呢啲data之餘咧，除非我有come into我awareness，我發覺察覺到有一啲嘢畀我知道，我需要去再查問多啲，otherwise就算。

409
01:12:45,710 --> 01:13:05,720
誒第二個問題咧，我諗誒誒梁繼昌，如果你即係其實你問就最好就問誒誒與會者咧。好，我政府政府你遲啲問啦，因為點解因為與會者會坐喺度等住你哋問。我我我再兩邊都可以答嘅呢個問題，其實即係即係大家都會答。即係我想問完政府，再再睇下佢哋有咩comment。但係呢條問題咧。

410
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:25,730
都係嗰個香港税務居民呢一個嘅定義，我諗大家有唔同嘅解讀。咁當然，如果你同一個國家簽咗CPTA或者Tear嘅時候呢？咁誒喺嗰個Tear或者CPTA入邊係有一個係誒一個協議上邊嘅。

411
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:49,580
咁誒，但係呢一個協議入邊嘅定義咧，好多時同我哋domestic law，即係我哋而家I O入邊，餵我哋根本冇香港税務居民呢樣嘢喎。可能即係誒係，因為我哋係地域來源徵税啊嘛。咁誒，外國嘅誒。

412
01:13:49,600 --> 01:14:09,610
誒，税務當局去處理呢個問題嘅時候，當肯當然都係要翻嗰個account holder自己去去報報告自己係咪香港税務居民啦。噉我我諗呢樣嘢咧誒會幾confusing，因為咧香港，比如話一啲香港嘅移咗移咗居去外。

413
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:29,620
外地嘅居民，或者甚至一啲香港本地居民，又喺外國有有account嘅誒人咧，都未必知道自己係咪香港税務居民，因為我諗喺本地嘅法例同埋嗰個C.T.T.A.入邊嗰個香港税務居民，我唔講外地，因為我哋嚟源徵税嗰個嗰個概念咧係完全唔同嘅。咁究竟即係税務局或者我諗。

414
01:14:43,510 --> 01:15:03,520
姚會長有咩有冇答案？我我我係同意啊，梁議員嘅嘅講法嘅。即係個Russell先生嘅係好好比較複雜嘅。點解咧？即係其實當然每個國家有每個國家嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅定論啦，嘅個definition啦。同樣情況之下咧，嗰個tax treaty本身咧亦都會跌。

415
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:57,800
啲資料咧。

416
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,500
噉啊，居英權係重犯。

417
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,420
係咪香港居民會可能係㗎？

418
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,300
啊！就就補充嘢啊，阿梁繼昌業。

419
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,560
佢又未，佢有啲好多係未。

420
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:47,900
因為咧高英權究竟究竟佢佢因為最慘咪多人喎啊咁究竟譬如如果高英權嗰啲佢係唔係英國嘅税務居民咧？

421
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:36,430
誒，主席，其實咧我都係誒誒誒跟跟翻就先，我嗰個問題想問多深入少少嘅啫。嗱，當然即係即係呢啲其實係誒一法律實施咧，就無論嗰啲誒。

422
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:22,390
每一個國家佢個法律誒同埋佢嘅指引，去點樣去評定嗰個税務居民，同埋誒佢哋個有關嘅法律條款。噉我哋都會借鏡有關嘅嗰個資料咧，睇下點樣可以利用嗰個咧去宣傳喺翻本地嗰度。好啊，陶恩新言。

423
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:23,530
翻啊個居民嘅咁有有人可係可以tax resident in both countries嘅。咁喺呢個時候咧，就喺嗰個税務協議嗰處去去判斷啦。咁講噉，譬如假如我係喺香港住嘅噉，但係我亦都可能係Canadian嘅resident，都唔奇嘅。OK，咁好多時喺方面嚟講喺加。

424
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:43,540
大税局同香港税局喺執行嗰個税務協議嘅時，先定話我到底係咪加拿大居民咁噉。實所以頭先我咁講啊，即係嗰個個taxpayer知道本身佢係咪邊申報咗去加拿大税局係好非常之重要啦。咁無啦啦，突然間咧，我原來税局話話啲錯誤嘅。

425
01:15:43,550 --> 01:16:03,560
嘅嘅嘅嘅detention，定咗我係加拿大居民，咁加拿大税咁買咁找我付起噉嘅麻煩啦，係咪？噉我覺得嚟講咧，就係啊一個呢個一個第一個education好重要啦，第二嚟講咧係嗰個所謂叫做溝通係非常之重要，嗰個所謂叫做除咗頭先講話保障嗰個嗰個嗰個private嘅protection之外咧。

426
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:23,600
嗰個頭先講個safeguard嘅taxpayer到底個資料去到外國有冇錯誤嘅？唔係一定話銀行嘅錯，或者未必一定係ILD嘅錯，但係有可能係delete some taxes係誒呢個taxpayer知道我係會可以defend我係咪居民呢樣嘢啊？同樣道理誒，係我加拿大住。

427
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:46,150
啊！啊，秘書長或者局長有咩問題？多謝主席。係好簡單，提供翻兩個資料啦。就住豁免嗰度，誒共同匯報標準咧，就住嗰個財務機構同埋誒帳户咧，都有提供一定嘅豁免。噉佢哋嗰方面咧個標準之下有提供十五項豁免。噉我哋經諮詢咗誒團體之後咧，喺

428
01:16:46,150 --> 01:17:06,160
而家現行法例裏邊咧，我哋提供多五項嘅豁免噉，基本上咧都類似喺海外帳户個合規法案裏邊有嘅咧，我哋都有提供。第二咧就係個税務居民嗰個定義，誒有關嘅資料咧，O E C D咧都誒最近已經發布咗喺個網頁嗰度咧，誒好詳細羅列。

429
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,450
嗱，再提供多一次。

430
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:42,900
佢咧就好多人咧就由你呃呃咗你哋，就搏咧碎骨汁。

431
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:14,700
就問翻咧，就譬如話，我嗱，我就建議一個噉嘅。

432
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:19,420
我建議咧就係一個叫做second tier嘅，即係嘅。我上一次啊，就政府就會會覆我哋。

433
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:25,560
噉啊，第三咧就係有關於話香港係冇taxation呢樣嘢嘅。

434
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:18,460
今次咧，如果你嗰啲嘢係錯啊假嘅咧，就係刑事啦，坐監啦，咁即係舉個例嚇噉。

435
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:06,110
誒或者我簡短講講，因為嗰個resident啊，或者係tax resident（税務居民）呢樣嘢咧，第一首先係一個好複雜問題。

436
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:16,240
税務條例個簽署嗰度咧，嗰個text page裏邊係有有條文嘅，有條文點樣定咧？即係有咩界 line，有四五點咧，係定嗰個咩叫税務居民。

437
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:18,820
第二咧就係話嗰個譬如銀行啊，或者係代呢個客户點樣填咧？呢個銀行去明白或者瞭解咩叫tax residence咧，我覺得係對銀行一個負擔嚟。

438
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:31,960
就係話一個第二陣嘅執行嘅點咧？就總言之，你哋咧負責咧就係問佢一啲question呢啊咩咩都好啦，即係education嗰啲啊叫啊，噉啊答答曬你啦，噉啊你咪如果你覺得係嘅，咪比誰高咯噉。

439
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:57,070
捉唔到出嚟，先至先至咧就就搏搏搏搏得一搏啦噉啊！啊噉啊，有有有咩嘅嘅影響，或者你哋嘅情況有咩意見咧？噉樣好啊！誒，團體有咩意見？係啊，伍生。

440
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:49,110
噉啊，當然如果有啲情況，税局睇完之後發覺咦唔妥喎，喂點解呢個明明呢個係㗎噉樣？噉我就建議咧就唔好咧，就係由嗰個客向你哋提供嗰樣嘢咧，就作為刑事嘅誒誒誒誒罰罰嘅基礎。

441
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:56,860
叫誒客户啦嚇，一隻你哋嘅客户誒，或者咧個公司，即係你哋誒銀行啊，或者財務機構咧，就要要做㗎啦嘛，係嘛？咁所以咧嗰個理解咧係幾重要，即係我哋緊立緊啲咩例咧？誒咩人係有一個強制嘅責任去誒誒做啲乜嘢咧？噉，因為我誒個諗法咧就係，如果佢叫佢提供一啲原始

442
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:18,140
噉我覺得咧就公道啲嘅。如果叫佢去誒做一個結論咧，法律結論咧，噉啊好危險嘅，因為佢自己都可能唔知啊，即係噉樣啊。噉啊，譬如你原始資料就係你你你你所知你自己有冇誒誒誒咩嘅誒國籍噉。咁當然當然都有複雜嘅，即係譬如你揸住誒A嗰個國家pass。

443
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:38,150
咁其實原來你噉嘅親生老竇咧就係私嘅噉，佢又走咗佬，從就從來都冇認你嘅噉樣。噉啊，突然間走翻出嚟嘅時候咧，你又麻煩啦。即係你有私國籍嘅噉樣，嚇，即係乜都乜都可能嘅，即係好到好複雜啊。甚至你阿媽都唔話畀你聽，原來你係美國出世咧，根本你就有美國籍嘅啊，從來咁即係你你明嘅，即係複好複雜啊呢啲嘢，即係啊人生間嘢。

444
01:18:50,840 --> 01:19:10,850
未咩？未未去攞passport嘅喎。OK，即係佢，因為我知我所知嘅居英權咧，就係佢直情係畀可有啲甚至咧就係誒誒誒誒，佢喺誒英國可能佢登記咗你係英國居居公公民，但係你自己咧連passport又冇攞，又未去去land，又未成，乜都冇嘅。OK，噉啊變咗咧就煩到即係不得了。咁所以我就不如。

445
01:19:49,390 --> 01:20:09,400
就應該咩咧？應該咧就係税局發覺有啲問題啦，有個人就由税局出一封信畀嗰個人。嗱，我係税局啊，啊嗱，而家我就要有責任去交換嘅。O.K.我就由呢個銀行咧或者綜合咧就誒收到啲噉嘅資料，就你就話唔係O.K.或者點點點咁咁咧嗱。如果你請你。

446
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:39,390
噉我就提議係噉樣咧就好啲，就好過咧即係銀行個經理有時話：誒阿阿陶生得唔得閒啊？喂，填填兩句，喂唔緊要嗱嗱聲快啲誒誒，十分鐘搞掂佢，五分鐘搞掂佢，即係有時係驚啊！你明嘛啊咁噉啊？我覺得唔知你哋嘅睇法覺得係點咧？覺得因為會唔會寬鬆個頭啊？噉啊搞到咧就原來咧就係我哋。

447
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,340
噉。

448
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,670
銀行係會。

449
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,710
就包括嗰個structure啦、syntax啦。

450
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,620
如果嗰個O E A U I嗰個portal上面冇呢一個資料咧？

451
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:21,690
所以可以有個指引。好啊，誒變為阿阮生。

452
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,940
即係普遍嚟講咧，銀行只會test個structure同埋個syntax嘅啫。

453
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:55,380
同埋香港第日，我相信亦都係。如果O E C呢個portal上邊有嘅嘅tax residence嘅資料，

454
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:19,700
銀行係可以唔使check唔使check嘅，根據OECD個指引，我諗香港除非佢specifically寫話要啦，如果唔係就唔會去菲律賓㗎啦。

455
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:46,990
啊！咁而家嘅指引咧，國際上譬如Wave One嗰啲countries啦，即係頭先啊啊秘書長講嘅先行者嗰啲國家咧。

456
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:20,540
即係當然有有時間性啦，但係佢自己係應該知噉，所以咧個配合咗個self certification咧，同埋佢嗰個reasonable test咧。

457
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:45,050
普遍嚟講，銀行係唔會畀誒customer，即係in normal course of banking transactions咧，就唔會畀客，即係唔會offer客誒tax and legal advice嘅。

458
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:33,850
我我想誒，首先講誒，就銀行普遍嚟講啊，我可能有個別啊，可能有個別銀行就唔清楚，但係。

459
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:10,600
咁雖然我哋我就唔會即係太draw on to嗰個tax residence嗰個definition啦，但係咧，其實呢一個係關於嗰個客individual又好，公司又好，係一個meta factor。

460
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:34,440
咁所以即係頭先陶議員講嗰個tier two、second tier嗰個方式咧，其實個概念上就即係個平常個概念啦，但係執行起上嚟咧，其實係會好睏難嘅。

461
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:58,130
咁呢樣包括咗factor啦，咁當然我哋亦都會同樣嘅principle apply落呢個C.R.S.嗰度，咁所以填個self-certification咧就真係literally根據嗰個字啦，佢自己嘅certification。

462
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:37,960
我哋覺得而家執行上咧，雖然有challenges，但係咧還可以噉樣去做嘅，因為factor有個經驗。但係我同意，亦都誒，就算銀行入邊都會傾，究竟我哋要去test到幾reasonable咧？

463
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:45,870
咁而誒外國就即係我哋喺對外有啦噉，我相信嗰個嗰個誒叫做解決嘅嘅方向啊，就係我哋香港同外國嗰簽署嘅協議咧，根據個model treaty嚟講咧，即係《奧伊西尼model treaty》裏邊咧有個誒resident一個定義嘅。

464
01:21:45,870 --> 01:22:05,880
可以跟嗰個定義去做，即係可能有四五個step嘅。即係主要就係話，就算我哋冇我，就算我哋誒香港税例係冇或者少咧，有關誒tax resident Hong Kong tax resident或者第二啲tax resident啊，我哋可以咧係誒引用或者係就基於咧嗰個。

465
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:46,400
兩。

466
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:40,260
台新金融仲有跟進。

467
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,550
information on our residents who bank abroad.

468
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,040
誒，主席，我或者講多一句好簡單嘅啫，其實個意思。阿低登登，Mr. Hung，OK。

469
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:44,990
which, if I may, through you, Mr. Chairman, seek the administration's views upon.

470
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:42,730
嗱，我即係我唔知道I.D.有啲咩資料啦，可以去check啦，individually。但係如果我哋將收集咗嘅self-certification

471
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:56,600
在Our submission， we question why the IRD wants to obtain from foreign governments.

472
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:45,740
圖 diagram which is before you. I'd just like to know the policy imperative for that when we don't need that information because we don't tax our people on it.好啊，秘書長。

473
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:37,890
嘅執法咧，其實未必會好似我哋嘅夥伴一樣咁需要。咁但係基本上呢一套嘅協定嘅一個交換資料嘅誒前提同埋嗰個嘅精神咧，係互惠噉樣做嘅。

474
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:12,320
咁新嘅客户當然更加會影響到佢開户口嘅嘅速度啦。咁呢個如果係誒外來投資者啊，或者做生意嘅，咁亦都會影響到。咁所以嗰個執行起上嚟會困難嘅。

475
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:59,060
就算新嘅户客户又好，舊嘅客户又好，要畀個volume好大嘅，會畀啊一啲咧。咁嗰個turnaround time咧係未必可以能夠做到而家國際上一至兩年嗰個要求。

476
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:16,220
in our in our FATCA agreement it is non-reciprocal. We don't require the Americans to fish around their banks to tell us about Hong Kongers who bank in America. My question is why is it

477
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:39,240
Mr. Chairman, I agree with the previous speakers. This is a not an easy issue, but one I believe that can be adequately addressed in the individual treaties. And as the information gatherers get more experienced, I have a related question which arises from the submission that we made.

478
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:36,530
That Hong Kong is proposing to make these agreements reciprocal, so that the foreign financial institutions fish round their accounts to identify Hong Kongers, get that information, give it to their tax authorities, who then pass it on to ours, as per the data pool.

479
01:26:46,280 --> 01:27:06,290
答呢一個誒針對嘅問題啦，誒我諗呢一個成個AEOI嗰個誒經合組織嘅嗰個標準咧，都係建基於喺互惠嘅原則啊嚟到進行。咁誒亦都係好似我哋而家做誒一啲誒税務交換資料協定TIA或者CETA咧，都係一個互惠嘅原則嘅。咁

480
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,010
啊，先生。

481
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:38,880
而嗰個人咧，係要搭税局。

482
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,750
佢會怪你哋嘅同事咧，就唔係。

483
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:49,530
誒，即係好認真咁警告佢啊！嚇啊咩啊，坐監啊咩咩咩噉。

484
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:35,970
真係誒誒誒有懷疑嘅，噉佢就要同嗰個人再確認一次。

485
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:08,670
點樣send我啫？噉樣嚇咁噉，你即係你你只要做啲問卷咧，成日咧有印象咧就係我你你噉，即係啲人會有噉樣，即係有一部分人起碼會噉樣諗法嘅。

486
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:50,600
誒，朱姐嗰個，誒，我頭先所講或者我我我講得唔係幾好啊，誒，我我驚誤導咗你哋就，即係我意思係話咧就誒。

487
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:41,010
即係你你明我講咩？即係因為因為因為因為可能有時你個主任誒見佢忙嘅話，誒得啦，你填得㗎啦，係咁依填得噉啊啊啊誒或者係誒誒得啦，總之你你別你你有就填落去啦噉，即係變咗咧。

488
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:46,130
凍死人啊！多倫多又翻誒，咪揾個温又翻翻嚟。哇！噉你又係又係庶民居民喎，大佬係咪先？即係咁變咗呢啲嘢咧，我覺得咧，即係你要明白嗰個闊度啊，嗰啲嘢咧，就我唔知道誒。你你覺得呢個係咪係咪？因為因為啊，你你好都好擔心，就調翻轉。

489
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:28,700
嗯，檢查啦，噉你哋就覺得即係係可以開到户口啦，咁即係我意思係話佢哋税局啊，係誒認為誒如果有問題嘅時候咧，就係往後佢收集咗好多啦嚇，噉佢如果覺得有啲嘢佢係。

490
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:26,300
所以香港咧喺履行呢個誒標準同埋去落實個框架嘅時候咧，我哋都係秉承翻呢一個互惠嘅原則嚟到做。縱使咧誒，我我我同意就係話喺大部分情況下税，因為我哋唔係全球徵税啦，咁所以税務局係咪需要去倚仗呢啲資料去再進行其他嘅税務？

491
01:27:51,400 --> 01:28:11,410
如果誒，你哋收集到嗰啲sales duty duty period，即係自我誒填咗啲問卷咧，噉你交曬畀税局噉，其實咧就就就算你開户口都好咧，我就理解咧，你哋係中言之，你覺得過咗誒duty duty period啦嚇，即係你哋嗰個基本嘅合理嘅誒嘅誒。

492
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:59,170
因為一般我哋市民咧，即係好老實講咧，我哋搭税局咧係認真過我哋搭銀行好多嘅。OK嗱，當然你話喂噉，你喂喂搭銀行噉，你咪咩咁咁？有時你問你你知因為你嗰啲問卷嘅嘢咧，好多時咧就話你話喂誒幾多薪金咩咩誒每年啊。其實我成日覺得啊，你哋可能咧就都係分析下誒，我嚟。

493
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:28,960
噉啊，所以咧就，但係税局唔係喎，税局問親你，喂，有咩嘢就啊，你會認真好多，就變咗咧就我就唔想咧，即係會好危險咧。就有時咧，即係真係比較誒誒掉以輕心啊，或者casual即係答咗，而最後咧就攞嗰樣嘢嚟就告佢咧。噉我覺得你你哋可能調翻轉，你個主任咧都畀人怪啊，即係。

494
01:29:49,810 --> 01:30:09,820
噉啊，你哋一一般嘅面口唔會咁㗎嘛，係咪先啊？咁但係你税局再再寄到信畀佢，或者誒誒誒再問查問嘅時候，噉你如果都答啊，噉啊死而無怨啦，即係大佬答，嗱乜你啲啊仲唔係噏噉樣，係嘛？即係我覺得反而咧就同埋同埋一般而家啲市民咧就唔會唔會覺得喂，我原來畀你，你又畀佢，佢又畀咩外？

495
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,600
噉。

496
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,930
到。

497
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,740
名畀聽，依個就係A。

498
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,970
國家嘅tax resident畀曬啱啱嚟。

499
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,790
某一個市民，唔好講公司先啦，講市民。

500
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:35,520
我咁即係誒，我想睇睇政府嗰度啦。其實好簡單嘅。

501
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:10,400
噉我就唔清楚會税局有冇噉嘅資料去verify。

502
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:08,910
其實你税局係冇可能查到邊個係嘅喎。

503
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:49,390
啊，或者佢嘅functional equivalent啊，咁呢啲definition就喺個OECD或者個表度有嘅。

504
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:25,460
唔需要銀行係畀呢個self certification嗰個copy畀税局嘅。

505
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:18,320
就住呢個問題咧，就我諗有幾點啦。第一，而家現行個標嘅嘅requirement啫，就唔需要。

506
01:32:53,400 --> 01:33:03,460
咁其實你又會交畀A國家，即係經過你嘅步驟啦。噉，但係餘有啲冇交畀你係A國家嘅。

507
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:46,850
當我哋前同A嘅國家簽咗交換協議，噉就銀行就畀咗一揸。

508
01:31:51,940 --> 01:32:05,400
咁當然啦，最基本即係最緊要就係呢兩組嘅data，個country同埋個天，啊，噉就算就算我哋將嗰個self-certification畀咗税局。

509
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:30,780
Off the street，噉佢填咗啦。我話係A、B、C country嘅，噉我唔知道税局會唔會有呢啲data可以去check到啊？呢個係咪啱嘅？然後就寄封信問佢嚇，呢個我就唔知道可唔可行啦。就要我諗。OK，我哋問翻佢。

510
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:42,620
嚇，咁呢個第一啦。咁第二咧，self-certification上邊關於tax residence嘅嘅嘅新嘅data啦，即係我哋collect嘅咧，就係兩個，就係佢個country個countries of tax residence。如果佢多過一個嘅話，同埋佢相應嗰個叫tax identification number。

511
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:29,830
哇！搞到咁遠嘅係嘛？即係你記住，而家我哋係好闊㗎嘛。嗰啲唔係個個都係我哋啲，即係我哋啲醒啲嘅叫咧，就知道咩事啊。有啲其實烏下烏下噉樣，我媽噉嘅噉。你你有時你答啲嘢噉，但係你記住係咪？test washington冇嘅喎，可能分鐘誒。有啲佢跟住阿阿媽跟住佢移民去加拿大幾日幾年後，哇！東哥頭。

512
01:30:46,520 --> 01:31:06,530
太多人係咁呃，而而嗰個税局咧又又check唔到，於是第啲國家咧就嘈冤巴閉，跟住我哋係畀人針對啊，又話要制裁，有冇去到咁咧咁？阿道懷生，我就噉樣建議啦，即係第二陣先至先至税局先至先至畀畀佢先至當嗰個係一個誒刑事嘅事實基礎噉樣。好啊。

513
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,860
好啊，張華峯議員。

514
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,840
揾警察拉鬼咗佢，即刻就。

515
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:56,910
上法庭啊！因為你有咩步驟去執行呢個法律咧，或者你噉樣解釋畀阿土議員聽會比較穩陣啲啊！撒花撒翻我啲好嘛？

516
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:49,340
一個介入式嘅調查，亦都唔係咧，係去誒研究嗰個當地嘅税務居民嘅法律，或者咧去提供法律嘅意見。呢個嘅精神係非常清楚嘅。

517
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:23,800
直至到A國家話唔係，有一個叫陶錦新啊，就係噉樣。你幫我處理，你只會處理㗎嘛，你唔會有一大扎探員去周圍揾㗎嘛，係咪？噉。

518
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:44,150
然後個問題就陶恩生就話係啦，嗱，佢啊呃咗冇田畀你，佢啊霎下霎下噉樣，銀行叫佢唔嘅一田，誒上乜田啫噉樣A國家噉樣好啦。咁之後即係税局或者政府可唔可能講你跟住你會係點樣做咧？會唔會又即刻？

519
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:17,680
多謝主席。誒，你個理解係正確嘅。誒，正如頭先團體所表達啦，其實成套嗰個嘅要求個標準咧，都係去制定套程序，誒，同埋嗰個提供資料嘅嗰個嘅一啲指定嘅格式。咁而我哋係期望財務機構咧，去依循。

520
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:37,690
嗰地既定嘅程序，同埋揾出所指明嘅嗰幾項身份標記，誒，然後咧，佢哋用翻一個合理嘅程序咧，去辨識同埋識別咧，做複核咧，就可以㗎啦。喺税局嘅層面咧，我哋係信納財務機構所提供嘅資料。當然啦，正如你頭先所講啦。

521
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:57,700
誒看似就係話咁點樣去確保個有效實施咧？咁誒税局咧冇其他嘅資料咧，係可以去評估所提供嘅嗰啲誒税務居民啊，或者個天咧係咪正確，或者仲有冇漏報嘅咁誒？税局咧係將有關財務機構所提供嘅一係列嘅對嗰個夥伴所有關嘅財。

522
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:17,710
財務帳户資料咧，就係轉交畀佢嗰個夥伴嘅國家。誒，如果夥伴嘅國家認為裏邊有啲資料不符或者係有漏報咧，佢哋可能會提出翻嗰個嘅誒回應咧，畀翻税務當局。噉我税務當局咧去跟進咧，就住依套框架個標。

523
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:37,720
標準係咪有效實施咧？我諗我哋要履行個國際標準，就係話去睇翻咧財務機構係咪有合理地跟翻個程序，同埋合理地去揾標記，都係跟翻個程序同埋嗰個格式。係從呢個角度，誒共同會報標準已經係誒強調咗咧，唔係期望財務機構做。

524
01:35:51,440 --> 01:36:11,450
誒主席，嗱頭先聽到梁生議員嘅建議咧，我覺得係非常好嘅，亦都代表咗金融機構嘅關注。咁作為呢個證券界嘅代表咧，我哋證券界都好關注嗰個合規嘅成本。我哋好即係擔心咧，呢個複雜嘅呢個呢。

525
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:31,460
個程序咧會增加我哋嘅人員啊嘅成本。噉啊，我哋希望咧即係啊執法機構咧喺定定呢啲噉嘅即係個調劑措施係嚴格，但係咧執行咧應該係寬鬆啲嘅。咁頭先我哋都聽到副秘書長講，我哋係合作。

526
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:51,470
就唔係政府想加多一啲噉嘅監管，噉我諗呢個方向非常之正確。咁因為我哋個證券行嘅客户嘅種類就好多㗎，大大細細都有，所以希望咧政府將來啲拜訪啲公司咧，不論咧大細，特別係我哋中小企咧，都多啲。

527
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:45,740
唔參與依個C.R.S.嘅。

528
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:50,240
咁呢一個會唔會對整嚿？

529
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:06,960
嚇！噉你咧就要畀資料佢嘅。如果我哋某一日去同美國去參與，

530
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:36,330
税例係唔同嘅，咁但係人哋又乜人咧？就A、B、C、D、E、F、G國家，佢而家為咗。

531
01:40:50,530 --> 01:41:00,010
呢個國際合作係出咗大問題咧，即係美國就係最簡單，就係有入冇出嘅。佢又係任何人問佢攞資料，佢都唔採你嘅。

532
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:43,110
話係每一年都要入地，係冇錯。好嘛？啊嗱，或者畀我問一個問題先，因為Mr.亨講過咧，其實誒喺佢個submission佢講過咧，其實係美國係。

533
01:38:52,460 --> 01:39:09,650
嘅誒自我證明，直至我哋認為咧兩方面嘅資料咧係合理，同埋咧係冇含糊。咁呢個就係最緊要就係個財務機構運用你手頭所現有嘅一啲身份嘅標記嘅資料咧，係去評定翻嗰個自我證明是否合理同埋正確。

534
01:36:51,470 --> 01:37:11,480
去了解多啲，去啊瞭解佢哋嘅運作，然後咧定出嚟你嘅呢個啊嗰個工作程序會適合我哋啲嘅。咁喺呢度，我想問問，即係呢個叫想問問咧，即係如果我哋有個客户，佢自認為咧佢唔係嗰個其他嘅納税嘅居民。

535
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:32,420
但係咧，我哋知道佢經常嘅出入嗰個國家，或者佢嘅電話係一個外國嘅聯絡嘅電話，係外國字頭或者八十六號嘅字頭噉嘅情況之下，我哋要唔要跟進咧？雖然佢自己講，佢依佢而佢已經唔係嗰個嗰個其他。

536
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:52,430
地方嘅嗰個納税嘅嘅嘅納税人，但係喺今日情況之啊，我哋要唔要跟跟進嗰個責任喺邊度咧？我哋需唔需要負責任咧？誒，秘書長，呢個誒特別呢個誒最誒一個噉樣嘅誒情況之下咧，誒喺嗰個係誒共同會報標。

537
01:37:52,430 --> 01:38:12,440
上所定定嘅盡職審查程序裏邊咧，亦都有講嘅嗰個誒，最主要嗰個建基於咧，就係嗰個客户佢提供嘅有一個文件嘅證據咧，證明或者係一啲自我嘅證明，就係佢話佢係咪某一個地方嘅税務居民。嗱，假使咧佢係有一個證明嘅文件，話畀你聽。

538
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:32,450
佢唔係當地嘅税務居民。咁但係，如果嗰個誒金融機構佢喺佢自己嘅一啲電子系統啦，或者你一啲誒文件裏邊查識到，譬如好似係電話號碼呢啲噉樣樣嘅一啲身份標記啦，因為電話號碼可能都會係反映佢經常係用嗰個係佢嗰個電話。

539
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:52,460
打號碼咁程序裏邊咧，就誒會係誒期望咧個金融機構咧誒可能會認為嗰個所索取嘅身份嗰個嘅證明同埋嗰個自我證明咧，可能係有唔清楚或者含糊嘅地方噉，所以就會要求財務機構咧，你係可以合理地咧係去要求佢哋咧再作出翻一次。

540
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:29,940
好啊！誒，我想問問嗰個客户嘅資料要唔要update咧？譬如係每年咧更新一次再check過一次，定係即係開户口嗰陣時講明就係咧，要唔要一個update嘅時間？時間幾耐咧？好啊，李處長。誒誒，如果香港同某一個夥伴，譬如國家A去簽訂咗喺一個新報年裏邊。

541
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:49,950
交換嗰個資料啦，咁税務局咧就會向外頒布同税務同財務機構咧去通知佢哋喺邊一個申報年咧就需要去提交嗰啲資料，咁而佢哋都需要喺申報年之前嗰一年咧完成嗰個盡職審查，咁喺嗰一年所索取嘅資料咧就會係反映嗰個年份有關嘅資料，咁誒。

542
01:39:49,950 --> 01:40:09,960
如果喺以後所提供嘅時候咧，其實喺我哋香港嘅嗰個個人資料私隱條例裏邊咧，亦都係誒期望咧財務機構係必須要通知嗰個帳户持有人誒呢啲資料嘅用途，同埋咧要確保有關嘅資料咧係更新同埋正確。咁所以我哋亦都係誒同財務機構咧。

543
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:34,380
冇噉樣做。

544
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,330
好啊！阿梁家昌要。

545
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,210
都係遠參搭嘅啦，我諗。

546
01:43:57,210 --> 01:44:01,580
係可以根據翻税務條例咧，係係即係有有罰則嘅，其實。

547
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:52,930
美國唔參加就完全冇事，咁依啲喺國際標準嗰度點樣去睇咧？

548
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:47,260
攞佢嘅税務居民嘅税咧，就問曬我攞資料。咁依個係好單一方向嘅。噉啊，我哋唔參加就人哋又話我哋係税務天堂。

549
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:12,740
啲資料嘅，咁噉你哋嘅發覺有冇一啲噉嘅誒，或者你哋嘅呢個係compliance有冇同佢傾過？你哋有其實有冇一個誒additional嘅嘅嘅民事或者刑事責任？咁喺個自動税務資料交換呢方面，唔該啊。

550
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:17,920
咁喺呢一個誒自動税務資料交換嗰個草案入邊，誒，你哋有冇發覺會即係有多咗一啲嘅民事或者刑事責任嗱？呢個我未未詳細睇過整個草案，即係我諗誒。

551
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:29,970
提醒咗佢哋，當佢哋做嗰個個人資料收集聲明嘅時候咧，要更新翻呢一方面，提醒佢哋啲客咧係去確保有關嘅資料係正確，因為嗰個資料咧係屬於嗰個客嘅嗰個誒。如果佢提交嗰啲資料唔反映佢最新嘅情況咧，其實只係會誒誤導咗佢自己嗰個嘅税務居民個狀況。即係換句説話。

552
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:27,250
噉你O E C D又要推行依樣嘢，而美國就係唔參與一個即係咁大嚿，咁會唔會對整個執行依樣嘢咧？尤其是對我哋香港，即係我哋因為實際上我哋就冇需要攞人哋，即係我哋Western使外邊嘅資料，因為我哋嘅。

553
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:13,530
多謝主席一個好好嘅問題。首先我想誒講得清楚咧，就係誒美國所行嘅嗰套海外法規合規嘅法案咧，其實喺香港個執行嘅時候咧，冇經税局嘅，純粹就係誒財務機構佢將佢有關嘅資料同誒美國嘅税務當局去登記。

554
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:33,540
同埋將有關嘅資料提交畀佢係噉樣嘅。咁而誒而家喺O E C D所要落實同埋期望唔同嘅國家去做嘅咧，就係一套誒全球性統一誒，希望係有一個一致性嘅做法。咁誒誒，我哋都留意得到啦。其實大部分全球而家有九啊幾個嘅管係。

555
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:53,550
區咧已經係表達咗參與，而當中超過五十個以上咧，都會係二零一七年先鋒行咗做。呢五呢九啊幾個國家之中咧，當中喺我哋嘅頭二十位嘅貿易夥伴咧，當中超過一半咧，都已經係會誒表示係做呢一樣嘢。咁所以，我諗基於香。

556
01:42:53,550 --> 01:43:13,560
香港對外嘅呢一個貿易同經濟嘅考量咧，我哋都認為係有需要去誒跟隨呢一個噉樣嘅國際嘅趨勢嚟做。嗯，我哋明白，譬如喺美國嗰方面，佢有佢另一套嘅做法啦。咁所以更加之令我哋覺得咧，當我哋去落實呢個框架而去揀夥伴嘅時候咧。

557
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:33,570
我哋縱使喺O E C D個方面多翻咧，都向我哋有一個壓力，要我哋去簽多邊。我諗我哋咧都喺現階段嘅政策嘅方向咧，都會係去堅持，儘量堅持翻雙邊揀選一個合適嘅夥伴嚟做，而唔係一個大大範圍大規。

558
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,050
做。

559
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:45,190
就。

560
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,030
響或者。

561
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:16,710
咁呢個就係我哋。

562
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:51,270
我諗，或者即係悲傷，會唔會？

563
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:34,750
就有責任identify同verify嘅。

564
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,320
每年去嘗試多一次嘅。

565
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:38,650
咁嗰個就唔係C.R.S.啦，嗰個就係A.M.L.

566
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:25,870
如果講緊係誒verify啦、核實啦，我相信係叫做。

567
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,910
嗯，咁至於響誒C.R.S.嗰個requirement之下咧。

568
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:31,780
響現行嘅AML誒order之下咧，響即係KYC啦。

569
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:10,200
佢可能會成為一種叫做undocumented account，嗯，咁嗰種account咧嘅requirements咧就會需要嗰個relationship manager。

570
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:47,240
先即係我頭先講嗰個情形，噉就當然undocumented accounts又會有相關嘅誒，即係報畀税局嘅reporting requirements。

571
01:46:51,550 --> 01:47:02,870
喺幾時會出一份即係指引？起碼畀嗰啲FI知道咧。啊，你哋嘅要求，佢哋係究竟係做啲乜嘢嘢就可以滿足曬。

572
01:45:45,960 --> 01:46:00,660
某一類嘅客人就如果不合作嘅態度啦，就經過self certification我哋嘗試去攞嗰個self certification multiple times攞唔到，譬如include埋既定程序啦，喺銀行入邊之下咧。

573
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:57,210
啊，唔該，主席，我想問一問翻啦。嗱，當然而家喺現行嗰個税務條例底下咧，税税局咧係可以啊要求銀行或者一啲financial institution咧，就某些個案咧係提供誒資料嘅，即係誒你哋客户嘅資料。而如果你哋唔合作嘅時候咧，誒税局喺

574
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:38,210
啲機構誒可唔可以講一講有冇一啲誒，即係你覺得係加重咗嘅誒民事又好，或者刑事襲嗱？你哋其實只不過係一個中介者嘅啫，你只係負責啊將一啲嘅誒誒資料咧，係畀税局。

575
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:58,350
咁但係你係冇即係一個即係primary嘅誒responsibility或者即係去核實嗱呢啲資料嘅，即係個資料嘅準確性其實都係源於你哋個客户係咪？你哋冇一個即係基本嘅責任咧，係去誒verify呢啲。

576
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:37,010
知道嘅嘅責任就係一個程序嘅問題，嚇就唔係一個銀行認事嚇。銀行認事嗰個就係當一個reckless或者係wilful一個啲一個fraud嘅situation啦，嗰個就另外一個category嘅。但係如果你話我哋要verify客人嘅資料咧，就只係限於我哋頭。

577
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:42,200
submission that's been handled more by steps.

578
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:06,930
啊！你嘅要求啊，因為事實上啊，你。

579
01:49:47,530 --> 01:50:01,360
落實到咧，至到財務機構去開始做嗰個蒐集資料咧，大概有半年嘅時間。我哋希望喺半年裏邊可以密羅緊股同財務機構去共同去誒做好呢啲噉嘅指引。好啊，Miss。

580
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:38,280
of the previous lady in charge of this edition of Monica Bart here speak to a staff conference here in Hong Kong two years ago. So yes, we are in touch with them in terms of official.

581
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:27,320
可以做好多嘢嘅，但係其實越做多嘢個成本就越多嚇。咁但係即係學似頭先啊，遠生講，佢只要做到呢一度係咪可以滿足曬，即係啊政府或者法例嘅要求咧？噉樣呢個就比較誒主要嘅。因為如果唔係咧，啊梁星遠都講，即係你。

582
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:47,330
個成本係可以啊！你越做多嘢，越越越增加得大嘅。噉啊，實際上啊，面對即係又是F.I.面對種種嘅要求，由A.M.O.一一路咁去做咧，啊，係做好多嘢嘅。噉啊，當然即係啊，遲少少嘅即係正。

583
01:47:47,330 --> 01:48:07,340
政府都要諗諗一套成套嘅，你由嗰啲compliance嘅，即係同金管局諗埋一套一齊做，唔好話即係分開唔同嘅做法咧。其實都好辛苦嘅啊！又要有個database係要做啊，每次你加啲嘢又要轉依個即係電腦嘅程式啊，依啲都係唔係容易做嘅。即

584
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:27,350
即係唔係咁容易做嘅嘢嘅，咁所以即係最緊要係令到啊F.I.啊大又好細又好，佢知道自己要做嘅合法合規係要做啲乜嘢嘢啊個程度係乜嘢嘢，咁或者你會即係考慮幾時會同誒業界一齊商量啊呢一套噉嘅標準。

585
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:47,500
多謝主席，我哋係會考慮噉樣做嘅，而我哋都覺得呢一個係必須嘅。咁事實上，我哋當前嘅誒任務就係希望可以將嗰個框架裏邊嘅嗰個原則同埋嗰啲誒誒誒名詞啊、誒誒啲誒注釋啊，就定落嚟啦。咁然後嗰個就。

586
01:48:47,500 --> 01:49:07,510
係一個基礎咧，誒，讓我哋去誒吸納咗啲財務機構誒畀我哋嘅意見，咁然後咧就係去草擬有關嘅嗰啲指引。咁誒，其實我哋同財務機構嗰個誒溝通咧，一路都進行當中。佢哋不時咧，當佢哋同佢哋嘅會員有傾咗，都有一啲唔同嘅方。

587
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:27,520
方面咧都有畀啲意見咧，希望就住個法例。如果當立法會已經通過，知道嗰個確立咗咧，噉佢哋就會希望喺一啲唔同嘅範疇、個細節嗰度咧，係希望我哋再去注釋啦。嗰個係一方面。噉我哋都希望嗰個指引咧，可以由財務機構嘅角度嚟出發。誒，亦都頭先剛才聽到好多。

588
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:47,530
多位議員同埋團體提到税務居民，我哋都會希望從誒居民嗰個角度啦，嚟到去出出發，儘量睇下點樣將嗰啲資料整理誒較易去明白啦。咁可能我哋都要分階段噉樣做，由個條例草案如果能夠喺誒即係誒我哋立法會年度前。

589
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:22,670
作為一項ongoing process with this bill，could you please establish with the administration whether they intend to respond in detail to the various submissions that have been made to this committee？My experience in in the past has been that they have so responded，and I wonder whether they intend to。

590
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:42,680
我諗即係政府係會詳細回應誒所有誒咁多個啊submission，即係包括你哋同埋書面啊或者其他團體嘅。咁依個我哋即係法案委員會都會係睇住政府係有適當嘅答案，然後滿足我哋，我哋至會。

591
01:50:42,680 --> 01:51:02,690
誒繼續去審議嘅。阿梁繼昌，姚好快想問一問啲啲啲機構啲朋友誒。過往咧，嗯G二十或者O E C D嘅一啲代表有冇嚟過訪問過你哋啊？即係For various purposes, have have they conducted visits um to to various institutions to O E C D or

592
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:36,090
Of course, I mean they they have dialogues with the government.

593
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:32,380
G20或OECD，因為我諗。

594
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:22,870
誒會議日期係三月二十二日星期二嘅，啊上午十點四十五分，好嘛？多謝各位。

595
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:28,450
先生，我我認為係一個好 idea， for industry organisation to establish a more proactive dialogue with

596
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:19,970
知你話誒誒CDTA裏邊有咩問題啊？噉佢都有有同我哋有交流嘅有。

597
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:50,870
世界辦公室在倫敦，which has made submissions on the content of of this whole scheme。其他團體有冇？

598
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:55,070
But of course, I mean you you have your own concerns as well, and I do think in future if you want the regime to run smoothly, I think you need to to to speak to D20, you know, or OECD directly, and also with the government, so that you you are in the loop.

599
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:22,700
The G20 representatives in Hong Kong, yeah. Mr. Personally speaking, I have met the former head of the division of the OEC, which meets the which deals with this, Mr. Pascal Sandemans, and indeed his predecessor, and we had the lady in charge.

600
01:51:51,850 --> 01:52:11,860
係啊，啊，啊，譚生，誒有冇交換意見咧？就誒喺China就有嘅，好似尤其是係啊，締盟總局噉，我哋譬如嘅施工會每年都同佢有個有個交流嘅，咁噉就唔係唔係我呢個呢個A O A U啊呢樣嘢，咁但係一般嚟講，譬如好似。

601
01:52:55,350 --> 01:53:15,360
Thank you。好啊，噉我諗時間今日嘅會議時間差唔多到啦。咁首先係多謝誒團體係出席，亦都畀咗好多寶貴意見我哋嘅。噉我諗誒政府就會係詳細係誒回應嗰啲誒問題嘅。噉就誒下次嘅誒。
