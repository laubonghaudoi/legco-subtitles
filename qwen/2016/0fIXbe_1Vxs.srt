1
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,720
早晨。

2
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,210
誒，我哋。

3
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,670
六百零一。

4
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,070
誒，早晨各位啊！

5
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,770
vision and mission statement.

6
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,740
同呢個誒。

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
夠鍾又夠人嚇，咁而家開始開會。

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,690
And that was to state explicitly.

9
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,160
誒請誒西九同埋政府嘅代表入嚟。

10
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,140
西九管理局嘅會議同埋政府嘅會議咧，就。

11
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,470
啊！噉我哋而家就開始開會。咁咧，議程嘅第一項咧就係。

12
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:24,840
And I'll go through that just in the order that it's it's presented. The first issue, of course, was the question of the proposed amendment to the preamble.

13
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:54,380
即係簡介下依份文件，噉我哋討論完咗依個文件，解決咗我哋上次啲提問之後咧，我哋先至再進入翻嗰個誒法例個誒文稿嗰度先啦，係嘛？誒西九邊位同事？你説得緊住。

14
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:12,900
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There are there are two things I need to address. The first is the follow-up for the meeting, and then if members will recall, at the end of the meeting there are a number of questions that were unanswered. So I'm happy to deal with those as well as part of this comments. The first part is the paper.

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:37,630
誒上次佢有個我哋問咗好多問題，叫佢書面回應嘅。噉佢嘅回應咧就已經喺嗰個誒文件C.B.括弧二一四二六slash十五-hyphen十六括弧零一號文件嘅。噉我想有冇西九嘅代表誒？

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:51,060
什麼？我們現在所提出的，是加作為序言的以下措辭：，「，一、，西貢文化區公共空間及西貢文化區的願景和使命，是根據《西貢文化區公約》第4條2m款所制定的。」

17
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,090
嗯。

18
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,790
要與Senior Park大使合作。

19
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,050
Authority for members of the public under the bylaw.

20
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,620
和，

21
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,610
The second issue that we were asked to

22
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,420
and to be given to each of these types of authorised persons under the bylaw.

23
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,100
Beyond that, of course, supervisory personnel such as senior park ambassadors or park managers.

24
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,260
要 inspire, promote and encourage cultural pursuits for all, so we're proposing that that be added as the preamble to address that first point.

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:33,000
look at was to specify in section three of the proposed bylaws the type of persons who would be given authorisation.

26
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:31,420
所以，會有不同層級的授權，和人員會被簡介和訓練，作為合適的層級，他們會被授權操作。例如，會有層級的人員，僱傭於相對基本的任務，例如園藝和清潔。

27
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:47,040
such personnel will be authorised to interact with the public to assist and advise, and of course give simple permissions for day-to-day matters. An example of this would be to allow members of the public to retrieve football from an area which is marked off for repair.

28
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:49,750
由WKCA和的functions，每種類型的授權人士須履行的職責，以及特別是賦予的權力，尤其是根據第10部關於拘留違反擬定規則的人的執行權力。

29
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:15,600
我們 wanted to clarify that personnel employed by WKCDA to work in the public open space will be given authorisation for the implementation of the proposed bylaw appropriate to their level of engagement with members of the public in their day-to-day work, and this should be reflected in their job descriptions and training.

30
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:12,960
二，西九龍文化區區署 aims to provide or facilitate the provision of free and accessible open space within the leased area to the general public， and three，西九龍文化區區署 aims to manage the open space in ways which aim to achieve the mission for the open space to.

31
00:04:51,530 --> 00:05:11,540
There'll be further levels of authorisation to personnel such as park ambassadors, who'll be briefed and trained to engage and guide members of the public as to what behaviours are not allowed under the proposed bylaw, or to give permissions when necessary, as allowed by the proposed bylaw, so as to better enable members of the public fully to enjoy the freedom intended by the.

32
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:40,390
安security personnel will be further authorised, briefed and trained to undertake more intensive enforcement action where discussion and persuasion from the park ambassador has not succeeded in preventing members of the public from breaching the proposed bylaw, or to detain members of the public who are clearly in breach of the proposed bylaw and refuse.

33
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,750
user-friendly manner.

34
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,810
的 authority is also considered.

35
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,840
the relevant requirement under the proposed bylaw.

36
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,900
Further, in the event of an offence under the proposed bylaw.

37
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,240
那係一個非常重要的概念。

38
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,420
和章五的 prosecution code published by the Department of Justice would refer.

39
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:46,390
在事件，一 offence under the proposed law has been committed， West Kalim Cultural District Authority would still have to consider whether it is in the public interest to prosecute the offender.

40
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:32,740
except in any smoking section, or cause a nuisance or annoyance to any other person after being requested to desist, we don't see any contemplate, do not contemplate any reasonable excuses which could justify a breach of these provisions.

41
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:31,480
relevant references including the Ocean Park Bylaw, the Kaduri Farm and Botanic Garden Bylaw, and the Pleasure Grounds Regulation, which legislation contains similar provisions relating to offences, but which do not provide a defence of reasonable excuse.

42
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:32,800
在眼，睛，

43
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:16,640
如果任何公園開放空間人員被要求給予許可，超出他的或她的代表權限，他或她會諮詢他的監督員，再上權限鏈，或請有關的訪客接近公園管理員，特別是如果需要書面授權。

44
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:14,130
In case there are good reasons which justify a departure from the requirement in the proposed bylaw, but are not expressly provided for in the proposed bylaw, an authorised person may give written or oral permission to relax these requirements pursuant to section 4 under Part 2 of the proposed bylaw.

45
00:05:43,730 --> 00:06:00,150
WKCDA considers there's no need to specify in section three of the proposed bylaw the type of persons who would be given authorisation and their functions, as those authorisations will be part of the job description and training given to the public and open space personnel.

46
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:55,630
第三 area that we were asked to comment on was this idea of a reasonable defence or reasonable excuse for offenders to be set out in sections seven, two, eight, four and nine, nine, as well as other offences punishable with a fine under the proposed bylaw, so as to enhance the protection for members of the public who might inadvertently contravene.

47
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:19,500
我們有考慮過這件事，細節，而我們認為並不需要提供合理的辯解來解釋這些違法行為。例如，第十三條一項的擬定法例要求公眾不得在公園或開放空間進行某些行為，例如不得吸煙或帶有火柴的香煙或煙鬥。

48
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:53,320
在 circumstances where there may be lawful excuses for contravention of the provision of the proposed bylaw, express provisions have been made in the proposed bylaw to provide for such a defence. For example, under section sixteen one, it is provided that except with a lawful excuse, a male person must not enter into any part of a public convenience.

49
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,220
just to give you the reference.

50
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,230
作為定義事件。

51
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,640
10. of the proposed bylaw.

52
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,920
所以， for these reasons， we don't consider the inclusion of a reasonable excuse is appropriate in the proposed bylaw.

53
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,870
where members of the public are free to attend without restriction or control of admission， the PPE does not apply.

54
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:01,350
如果 offender 有個合理的 excuses，such that the public interest would not be served by prosecuting the offender，the authority would not do so。

55
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:51,080
individually, that's the content of our written submission, Mr. Chairman. If you'd like, I can go on and address the remaining outstanding items.

56
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:50,460
Under Section 72, it would read: A person who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes Subsection 1, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at level one.

57
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:04,790
It is events of that nature which will require the written permission from the authority under Section Ten One of the proposed bylaw, in order to enable the authority to ensure public safety or order.

58
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:18,720
where such an event requires the authority or the organizer to restrict admission by closing parts of the public open space by ticketing or other means, such an invitation-only event, of course, the place the public entertainment ordinance would apply.

59
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:36,630
section seven two eight four nine nine, ten nine seventeen four twenty two two twenty three three and six， with exceptions being eleven two twelve three eighteen three and twenty three eight。

60
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:22,740
however, if members considered that there is a need to insert a reasonable excuse defence, we are prepared to add in, for instance, section seven below as an example, the appropriate wording without reasonable excuse, and these would be in.

61
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:41,160
as the proposed bylaw is subsidiary legislation, it would not override the operation of primary legislation such as the Place of Public Entertainment Ordinance. In circumstances where that ordinance would normally apply, and that means we would have to consider each case.

62
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:52,630
for the purposes of the proposed bylaw, an event is an activity of that kind which will occupy such amount of the public open space as may present members of the public or not members the audience some inconvenience or restrict their free access to the area concerned.

63
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:35,270
the essence of an event is that it is a performance, entertainment, activity or gathering, organised for the purpose of the organiser to present and engage the audience for a purpose, say for entertainment, education or any other purpose. Attendance by the public might be paid for or not, or ticketed or not.

64
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:12,250
我們亦都 requested to clarify the definition of events, the conduct of which would require the written permission of WKCDA under Section Ten One of the proposed bylaw, and advise whether persons who intended to conduct events in the public open space would be subject to the relevant requirement under the Place of Public Entertainment Ordinance, in addition to those under the.

65
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,140
係。

66
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,120
嗯。

67
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,090
所以，我們不 make 任何區別 between 公共和私隱事件。

68
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,020
the second area, the second question was whether persons who intended to conduct events in the public open space.

69
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,190
There were some questions about distribution of balloons, flowers, stickers, surveys, etc.

70
00:11:52,930 --> 00:12:02,110
at the end of the last meeting, there were a number of questions that were raised by members, which I thought I would just address directly.

71
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:33,190
的公共開放空間，which is closed for the event with ticketed or otherwise controlled admission, or would present the authority with difficulty in ensuring public safety or order.

72
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:19,550
The next question was: What is the difference between event and public events? And would events only involving a small number of participants, not causing nuisance, be subject to requirements to seek permission?

73
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:07,130
would be subject to the relevant requirements under the Place of Public Entertainment Ordinance, in addition to those under Section Ten of the proposed bylaw, and I think I've already addressed that in my previous comments, so I won't go into that again.

74
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:47,360
如果 no conditions were attached to management of the event, so again this is a judgement call. But basically, of course, we want to allow spontaneous events, and it's really only issues of safety and public order that we would try and control the areas.

75
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:37,410
作為extension to that question， I guess would morning exercise， dance and practice of tai chi without prior permission be prohibited？ Of course not。 In fact， I would encourage people to come and do tai chi and do exercise in the park。 I think it's something that we would like to see。

76
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:35,980
Would the authority consider specifying only that permission is required for public events? I we don't actually differentiate between events and public events. That's certainly not a reference that's included in the bylaw.

77
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:54,060
the as I've said before in answer to the earlier question, the issue here is really the nature of the event. What we want to do is to allow for spontaneous events. We certainly don't want to interfere with them. So if people come down and want to organise a small singing group, which happens all the time at the moment.

78
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:55,520
however, if we get ten thousand people wishing to do an organised tai chi event for safety reasons, we would have to look at that and we would of course talk to the organiser. But generally, one or two people doing it on a casual basis, even if it's on a regular basis, would not be subject to control.

79
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:22,460
One was: Will spontaneous activities without prior permission from the authority be allowed? Of course, the answer is yes. Has to be. Such spontaneous events would be allowed. The criteria to be applied is whether the activity is such that it creates inconvenience to other users. For that reason, should be isolated in a part.

80
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:14,530
They're free to do so. It's really only when it causes inconvenience to the public that we would have to look at what necessary additional control might be necessary. So we don't see that there is a distinction between public or private event. The issue is whether an area within the open space would be restricted access, and that's the definition that we're looking.

81
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,150
我哋畀大啲佢。

82
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,280
O唔OK？

83
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,700
噉樣搞到自己。

84
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,670
噉你逐點去？

85
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,560
誒，但係我度有啲問題。

86
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,810
誒已經聽我哋講加咗。

87
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,020
啊！誒，我哋提問就每人四分鐘聯問聯答。

88
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,330
第一嚇，括弧一嗰度咧加咗噉樣寫法，大家睇下咩意。

89
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,510
I think I'll stop here, Mr. Chairman. If I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions.

90
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,160
issues relating to the sale of such items is different, and that's something that would be caught and would require permission.

91
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:02,260
大家討論嚇過咗就我哋就唔傾啦，好嘛？我哋先講第一點嗰度咧，關於嗰個傳言嗰度咧。

92
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,990
噉我咧，咁咧就我哋先解決個呢個文件咧，我哋有四點嘅嚇，佢頭先回應咗先。

93
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:33,410
similarly, the distribution of balloons and flowers, or the conduct of a survey would not fall within the definition of event under the bylaw. But let me stress.

94
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:54,100
部分誒用喺即係公共空間嘅嗰部分咧，我覺得係咪即係唔得全面咧？

95
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:25,480
the distribution or fixing of bills, placards or notices without permission would be prohibited, and that's section 12e of the bylaw. While stickers could perhaps be considered as placards and be caught by 12e, the distribution of such in the public park and open space would not be an event within the meaning of the expression in the bylaw.

96
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:45,880
應該大家好，我想問下，即係西九管理局咧，點解你淨係加四個會議M咧？點解唔係成個四個會議都應該加曬落去咧？因為成個四個會議咧，就係嗰個前沿，即係我哋個vision嗰個使命嗰個整，即係整體嘅使命啊嘛。你淨係加咗其中一。

97
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,100
明咯。

98
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,350
有冇回應？

99
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,840
啊，係啲嘢。

100
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,710
係，我哋都係要考慮到呢個。

101
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,050
多謝主席。主席，你個觀察都非常之好。不如我調轉問咧，即係如果有議員查走咗個M。

102
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:54,370
如果其他同事都誒覺得冇問題，我就唔堅持咧，因為你頭先都解釋咗，我哋記錄喺我哋嘅文件裏邊咧嚇，但係睇一睇其他嘅同事嘅意見先。

103
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:20,570
唔係你個前言，你唔冇理由將佢分隔開嚟加入去㗎嘛，係嘛？你就係加M嗰M嗰度噉樣。其實佢誒主體法例嗰度有幾個噉啊？法律顧問。

104
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:07,960
先生，當然，我們已作出參考有關的相關條文，即係《主要法例》中提及公園及開放空間。其他條文並非與本節有關，所以無需要作出參考。

105
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:59,710
係咪唔夠全面咧？Mr. Chairman, of course, the primary legislation overrides the bylaw anyway. We are obliged to follow all the provisions within the the primary legislation, regardless of whether they're referred to in the bylaw. The point here is we're trying to make reference to the relevant section of the

106
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:41,430
其實而家西九喺嗰個嘅即係個誒辯言嗰度嘅第三段咧，就係講咧就係話係誒西九文化管理局咧，希望以旨在達成休憩用地嘅使命，即係啟發推動同埋鼓勵鼓勵大眾參與呢個文化活動嘅方式。咁因為睇翻咧喺嗰個主體法例咧section咧。

107
00:17:41,430 --> 00:18:01,440
就誒，即係第四條第二款咧，下低咧，即係除咗M以外咧，其實其他譬如喺誒G咧就會講誒，即係第四條嘅第二款G就會講誒，鼓勵本地社會更加廣泛參與各類嘅藝術文化啦，又或者係D啦，係提升對種類廣泛又多元化嘅藝術嘅欣賞。咁仲有其他各項。

108
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:21,450
其實都係涵蓋到即係一啲係推廣嘅文化藝術。咁點解呢度唔可以寫得闊啲咧？就係話係根據係such誒，即係第四條第二款咧而擬定嘅，而係淨限於M咧。即係呢度會唔會係有一個即係比較窄嘅廣，即係嗰個寫法，而係唔可以涵蓋到嗰種即係推動同埋鼓勵大眾參與文化活動嗰個嘅市？

109
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:42,840
或者我即係講，如果你仲用M咧，你即係講用呢個地方嗰個即係做法點樣做。但係嗰個活動嘅性質咧，其其其他嘅誒即係條文裏邊咧係有講埋嘅性質嘅。噉我覺得，如果喺個性質裏邊嘅時候你冇冇寫落依度咧，你有權覺得嗰個性質就隨你自己去諗啦。噉。

110
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:20,000
primary legislation in the context of the bylaw, but I can assure members that there's no question. the primary legislation, as the legal advisers pointed out, has much wider context, but we can't make reference to all of those relevant sections. Nevertheless, they will be the driving force behind which we will operate, and that's why we added the extra.

111
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:40,010
兩個section，section two and section three，which in a sense repeats the general approach，which is to inspire，promote and encourage cultural pursuits for all。We believe that's the appropriate way to proceed。In other words，to mirror the general provision，which is in the primary ordinance，rather than necessarily cover every single section。

112
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:23,340
淨係四闊會議咁喺呢個法例嘅執行上邊會會有啲咩唔同嘅效果？會唔會為政府或者為未來有啲咩不便？定係到時有拗叫要睇闊啲就只係噉樣噉。其實你話你都會睇主題法例㗎啦。咁咁嗰個分別在於乜嘢咧？

113
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,030
係。

114
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,940
Four two M。

115
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,990
即係呢個唔係問題，你問我嘅啊。

116
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,890
instead of in the light of section 42m.

117
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,690
絕對。係，我哋，我哋有冇 objection 到那，Mr. Chairman？

118
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,510
嗱，主席啊，其實咧就或者可以誒。

119
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,480
how about in the light of section four and in particular?

120
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:47,320
你求職答啊陳志全議員講咧，你都冇乜問題嘅，你炸咗佢都冇問題，咁不如炸咗佢咯。咁大家亦都唔會特登去幹預你㗎啦。嚇，誒，梁家傑議員。

121
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:05,050
問下即係誒西九文化區管理局咧，譬如可唔可以考慮我用翻個英文本咧？譬如話誒。

122
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:13,030
主席，噉你可以考慮，或者我哋，或者你都得喎，即係查走M達政府會點會點樣回應？佢冇分別嘅喎，咁冇分別，我尊重阿主席你嘅觀察同埋你嘅講法喎。係，其他誒有。

123
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:57,600
立法，你知，the whole point，as I understand it， of putting this preamble in， is to ensure that we adhere throughout to the principles that are set out in the primary legislation， and that's what we're doing。

124
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:55,950
即係條文咧，而呢一個附屬嘅法例咧，係應該誒服膺於嗰個大宏觀嘅大體嘅。咁既然我哋委員有噉嘅要求咧，即係我覺得係咪我頭先嗰個建議都無傷大雅咧？

125
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:43,350
係，謝好啊！誒，請答答啦。嗯，Mr. Chairman，我，It doesn't make any difference. We're just trying to make the the bylaw as succinct and and accurate as possible. I mean, the whole point of this is that we don't want to suddenly copy the primary legislation into the bylaw. We're making reference to the relevant subsection of the by of the primary.

126
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:36,920
即係，我覺得我哋都唔會吉寫成段誒A，即係由A至到N咁寫落去㗎啦，係嘛？我哋淨係寫依個條文噉樣嘅啫。不過你有你精簡啲，連個M都查埋，咪仲精簡。係啊，係啊，但係個概括性大啲。不過即係我覺得，即係如果。

127
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:36,680
呢個會唔會係一個誒可以接受咧？因為成個第四款咧，就係即係嗰個，即係頭先啊柏志高先生講咧，係嗰個誒，即係宏觀嘅，即係整體嘅嗰個誒。

128
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:20,980
咁或者誒，噉啊誒梁家傑議員講嗰個意見，可能我哋大家都放心啲咧，因為有真係有時候有啲嘢仲要講個性質啊，嗰個表現出嚟點樣，唔係淨係用你笪地方㗎嘛嚇。噉我覺得誒喺四日二嗰度已經好詳細概括。咁如果你噉樣寫。

129
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,890
好嘛。

130
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,640
點提？

131
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,690
誒。

132
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,960
係啊！係啊！

133
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,890
噉啊，到司。

134
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,540
頭先都解釋咗㗎啦，嚇。

135
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,830
嘅法，噉我諗大家冇意見咧。

136
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,970
即授權人士。

137
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340

如果咁寫，大家冇意見，我哋又過嘅咯喎，嚇。

141
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,540
如果冇意見，噉我哋通誒就過咗呢個A呢度，B嗰度咧，大家有咩意見？

142
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,860
有關呢個西九管理局講活動嗰對定義啊，咁大家有冇提問？

143
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,550
C咧就係講合理辯解，已經加咗啦。噉啊，大家冇冇新嘅意見啊嘛嚇。

144
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,190
B。

145
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,420
我哋先開始啦。

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,160
第十條係誒舉行活動。

148
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,040
咁同埋講一講點解要舉誒噉樣寫法咧嚇？

149
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:01,040
三，除非獲管理局書面準許，籌辦人不得。

159
00:23:52,430 --> 00:24:09,210
因為喺而家C嗰度關於合理辯解咧，即係佢有個別嘅條文都係誒加翻，咁但係佢有我哋而家做條審議咧。如果去到一啲個別條文，其實佢都係未有加到嘅，或者我哋去到相關嘅條文再去即係討論翻誒誒，即係有冇需要即係加翻啦嚇。

160
00:24:48,320 --> 00:25:08,330
由第十項開始，噉我想誒西九管理局嘅同事咧嚇，即係宣讀嗰個附例之前咧，都解解釋下嗰個定定呢個附例嗰個依依一條，即係你宣讀嗰條嘅嘅目的咧嚇誒嘅原意係乜嘢咧？咁可唔可以講一講之後先宣讀個附例啦？

161
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,910
六。

162
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,370

可要求該人離開用作活動場地的公眾休憩用地的該部分。

176
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,640
有冇提問？

177
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,580
係，好收啦。

178
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,000
噉佢即係入嚟拍。

179
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,600
嗰陣時可能未必係商業嘅，但係過咗之後。

180
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,170
如果冇意見咧，我哋進入下一條，好嘛？第十一條。

181
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,330
主席，第十一條係商業拍攝電影、攝影和錄像。

182
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,800
或公開展覽，關乎以上描述的行為的任何項目。

第二款，任何人違反第一款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第二級罰款。

184
00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:05,340
佢可能做一個嘅誒project，佢發覺即係嗰條片係可以攞嚟用嘅，咁及後嗰個發行變咗為商業，噉你又點處理咧？即係拍嘅時候冇商業嘅目的，但係及後用咗商業嘅用途，噉你追究定唔追究？

185
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:42,680
係主席啊！而家嗰啲即係手機咧，其實係係好普遍㗎嘛。你大家揸住個手機都即刻可以拍啦。噉我亦都留意到咧，其實解釋誒活動嘅時候咧，誒西九管理局都講咗，其實佢哋係用嗰個嘅restriction to access嗰度去計。

186
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:31,330
七，任何人如不符合有關的年齡要求，或不能或不願意根據第五款的要求出示年齡證明，或該人根據第六款被判定為不符合入場的年齡要求，有關獲授權人士或籌辦人。

187
00:29:44,840 --> 00:30:04,850
第一款，除非獲管理局的書面準許，任何人不得在公眾休憩用地內拍攝電影、攝影或以任何形式記錄視覺圖像或聲音，以求為利益或收益而在業務過程中出售、發表。

188
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,830
都都。

189
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,670
嗯。

190
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,730
嗯。

191
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,710
再再冇提問，邊位？

192
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,140
照片之後咧，佢都可能會放喺圖片社。

193
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,800
publicly exhibited or for sale is the appropriate test.

194
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:52,470
We want to make this distinction where it is for commercial purposes. If you simply use it as

195
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:20,510
That's why why we've made that distinction. So, in this case, we believe that having that test of being published.

196
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:37,310
因為我都想問下咧，譬如攝影活動咧，即係我自己都影相啦，好多朋友佢影相嘅時候咧，佢係影咗啲。

197
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:23,590
They may have sound equipment separate, etc. The distinction is is very clear, and that's that's why we've set it at quite a high standard. We don't want to catch the inadvertent person who simply brings their their iPhone and takes photos. That's why we're making the distinction. We believe this is a more flexible approach.

198
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:46,280
嚇，主席噉啊點樣處理？即係拍嘅時候未必係，即係可能你唔知啦嚇。誒，或者係拍嗰個人，佢佢做呢段錄像嘅時候都冇諗住係用商業用途，但係及後又喺一啲商業產品嗰度出現，咁李西九點處理啊？係啊，咁之後點處理？誒。

199
00:30:43,400 --> 00:31:03,410
嗱，我我點樣提呢個呢呢個問題出嚟咧？就係因為你拍攝嘅時候，其實係咪應該誒就住佢會唔會影響其他人用嗰個地方呢個準則，而唔係話商業咧？嗱，當然，如果佢係一個電影公司或者。

200
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:23,420
拍廣告，佢一嚟就已經係商業嘅，噉佢通常佢都費事麻煩，梗係同你申請啦。咁最好就係你幫手維持秩序，即係唔好有咁多人入鏡添。咁但係如果你真係誒一啲業餘嘅拍攝，噉佢誒可能學生電影係嘅學生，佢都唔係做商業嘅。

201
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:46,290
其實你係咪又要佢一樣係書面申請？如果佢係規模好細嘅，根本係唔會阻到其他人，你係咪可以寬鬆啲去處理咧？咁噉，主席，我覺得呢個係應該用，你會唔會阻礙其他人去用嗰個場地嚟做個原則咯？同埋咧，拍攝嘅時候咧，如果佢真係用手機拍，佢拍。

202
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:25,640
This is this is one of those issues that we've actually been trialling out in the nursery park. We have had a number of instances where people have approached us for commercial filming. We've had a number of instances where people have not approached us, but yet have clearly been using the park area for commercial purposes. So it it is actually

203
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:45,650
是，非常清楚，的。的，issue，as，we've，defined，here，is，where，it's，for，to，sell,，publish，or，publicly，exhibit，any，items.，We，don't，have，a，problem，with，the，casual，photographer.，I，do，photography.，I'm，sure，you，do，photography.，That，would，never，be，caught，by，this，provision.，The，issue，has，to，be，and，we.

204
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:13,010
inconvenience to the to members of the public. Quite honestly, we already get that with people who are doing just personal photography. They may ask someone to move. They want a better shot. We don't want to get into that situation. So that's why we're actually setting quite a high benchmark as something that is for a commercial purpose. and

205
00:33:46,690 --> 00:34:06,700
That that sort of thing will happen. Of course, with with smartphones, everybody can do that. We're more concerned really about the situation where, you know, people come in, they start to put in place, you know, lighting systems. They put in place the sort of major tripod.

206
00:34:41,420 --> 00:35:01,430
係或者佢有人適合嘅時候溜佢賣，佢唔係主動去諗住去揾錢，但係後期人哋覺得你影得好，不係你賣咗幅上去啦，或者收收購你幅上，咁呢啲算唔算咧？咁第一、第二，頭先即係阿Patrick講咧就話啊，你用三腳架啊，用呢啲噉啊，其實三腳架都好普遍嘅啫嘛，係嘛？尤其是你影。

207
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:21,440
想你唔用三腳架手震噉啊，好似我哋而家年紀大咁會手震嘅喎，咁梗係一定用三腳架靚啲啦，係嘛？而且咧有啲拍婚紗相咧，你見到成棚人嚟影咧，又反光板又成咧，其實全部都可能係業餘嘅喎，係個攝影會嘅啲活動嚟嘅喎，依啲都係文化藝術活動嚟嘅喎。你你其實應該係方便佢哋嘅喎。

208
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,070
OK。

209
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,020
可唔可以？

210
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,200
係啊啊！

211
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,500
大家嘅意見嚇。

212
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,120
咁仲有冇提問對呢個？

213
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,960
Makeup artist, they come with.

214
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,450
畀佢哋好啲，做一個即係管理，唔使影響其他人啦。

215
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,690
change of clothes， it's a whole different environment， and you can easily spot the difference.

216
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:10,990
噉我諗希望你哋即係誒得閒嘅時候就唔好影響到嗰啲業餘嗰啲攝影團體、藝術攝影團體嘅活動嚇，好啊。

217
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:13,480
然後我們可以Approach them and say sorry. You need you need to apply for permission because you are using this for a commercial purpose. That we've already dealt with, and it's it becomes very clear.

218
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:26,820
主席，咁誒呢一條咧就喺第二款嗰度咧，就誒會唔會喺西九嗰邊咧，會唔會考慮加入合理邊㗎？因為呢度就根據個書面嘅回覆，就誒應該唔包括呢一行嘅嚇。

219
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:43,960
We don't see the need in this case, as we say, we've already looked at the issues. It's very clear in many cases. There's there's really very little dispute whether it's a commercial activity or otherwise. So in this case, we don't see the need.

220
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:31,130
where it's just an individual coming in with his wife to be, and the the the groomsmen takes the photo, we we never have a problem with that, and we've dealt with those situations before. Again, yes, we do have amateur photographers bringing tripods.

221
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:41,450
係嘛？當然佢喺嗰個唔好滋擾到其他人嗰個情況底下，嚟佢先可以進行啦。噉我覺得依啲你係咪可以容許咁做咧？係嘛？佢又冇標識到話佢係一啲商業嘅婚紗攝影公司，佢可能只不過睇到佢係係就算有標識都可能某一個攝影會。咁依啲你可唔可以鼓勵咧？轉頭。

222
00:35:43,110 --> 00:36:03,120
Mr. Chairman, yes. In fact, this wedding issue is again something we've already experienced in the nursery park. If someone comes in and they're taking photos of a wedding group, we approach them and we say, you know, by all means enjoy. We take a note of who they are. If they come back two or three times, it's clear they're doing it commercially.

223
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:51,510
particularly for some of the spectacular photographs of Hong Kong Island, it's the best way. We never worry about those sort of things. Really, we're talking about something where there really is a a commercial element to this. And the wedding photographers that we tend to pick up as commercial wedding photographers don't just come with a tripod. They come with light stands. They come with make

224
00:37:50,470 --> 00:38:10,480
如果冇意見，噉我哋都根根據依樣嘢啦。我諗，如果佢業餘嘅藝術團體咧，我諗可以事先即係通知收緊管理局咧。噉我諗呢個管理局都會通融畀佢哋，雖然人多或者佢架撐多咧，都會畀佢玩玩嘅。如果唔係咧，即係早啲同佢哋講講啦。咁呢個都可。

225
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,030
啊！

226
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,740
冇 question。

227
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,530
對個。

228
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,470
大家意見。

229
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,210
第十二條。

230
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,590
好，下一條第十二條。

231
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,280
O.K.各位同事有冇提問？

232
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,400
係，佢話啊法律顧問。

233
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,110
遵從告示及指示。

234
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:10,070
好問咧就係嗱，如你譬如而家接住呢個十二闕湖三咁講啦。

235
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:58,560
或跌序而發出、給予或作出的，在公眾休憩用地內的人，均需遵從。

236
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:06,670
第三款，任何人違反第二款，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

237
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:51,110
第二款，凡管理局根據第一款發出的書面告示及獲授權人士所給予的任何指示或作出的要求，是為確保公共安全。

238
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:32,660
呢一個嘅誒十二條嘅第三款嗰度咧，因為係都係牽涉到即係話係要符合嗰個嘅誒告示同埋啲指令啦，咁會唔會係都考慮加上一個即係合理嘅辯解啦？可能都要考慮某啲情況下都需要作出嘅嚇。

239
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:37,300
一為確保公共安全或秩序，管理局可設在公共休憩用地的任何部分的顯眼處展示的書面告示，限制或禁止公眾在公共休憩用地的任何行為。

240
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
嗰個法庭。

241
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,410
其實佢唔係。

242
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,330
咁譬如佢佢吐咗痰噉樣。

243
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,580
有意去違反嗰個。

244
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:41,510
你話譬如你話個告示係你不能夠在誒此地吐痰先算啦。

245
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,900
嗰啲誒執行腐敗嘅人員去拗撬啊！即係我想知道其實嗰個諗法係點樣？噉樣由柏志高先生解釋多少少啦。

246
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:23,420
即係唔係誒點講啊？即係唔係話誒冇遵從嗰個告示同埋指示。

247
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:14,860
噉我要咁做啊！噉樣咧，即係我相信咧，呢啲咧就法庭可以接納為咧，佢唔係誒。

248
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:34,280
噉我相信嗰個法庭咧，應該都係有個酌情權㗎，係嘛？即係因為嗱，你你個問題噉，我睇下你個告示講咩啫。

249
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:37,970
嘅罰款咧，嗰個程序係點㗎？你你唔係派牛肉乾咁㗎嘛，係嘛？即係你你係點點樣做㗎？你都要係咪？如果佢唔同意，係咪都可以見官㗎嘛？係嘛？

250
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:12,310
嗰個誒，即係審訊嘅過程咧，即係如果佢真係有，又可以同個法官講，即係佢誒喺嗰度。

251
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:25,350
譬如你真係捉到有個人係冇根據嗰個誒告示或者指示嚟到行事咧，噉你要佢即係處以呢個第一級。

252
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:53,880
again in this case we think that because public safety and public order is concerned that these are issues that should not be amenable to a reasonable defence a reasonable excuse defence we believe that because the written notice is done deliberately and for a purpose it should be sufficient that people should comply they should

253
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:58,360
嗯，Mr. Chairman，We don't have any fixed penalty arrangements under this ordinance or the or in the bylaw. In each case, there would have to be a prosecution。係啦，咁所以我我就咁諗，即係點法律顧問講嗰樣嘢咧，其實應該可以咧，喺誒，即係事發之後咧，如果係喺

254
00:41:45,620 --> 00:42:05,630
咁但係咧，佢就話誒係啊，個指示係叫我唔好吐痰。不過咧，因為我嗰個時刻咧，我係誒即係有有一個唔知咩咧，就有種有種病，有種咩，我係控制唔到自己嘅，我有不隨意。

255
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:39,680
告示同埋指示啦，即係我明白管理局點解佢會唔唔係輕易寫嗰個叫做合理辯解，因為如果佢合理辯解寫落去咧，佢係咪驚喺在場去執行呢個誒附例嘅時候咧？咁嗰啲市民咧可以話我有合理辯解，噉就同。

256
00:42:48,580 --> 00:43:08,590
Mr. Chairman, actually, I think the honourable member has answered the question himself. It's about the level, the type of evidence that we would have to produce to convince the court. The court always has the discretion to make a decision. That's the nature of the court. So we believe there's no need for a reasonable excuse here, in the sense that we say no spitting. If someone

257
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,760
得出個邏輯係咩？我係我我未曾邀邀請啊，陳柏治高先生解釋之前。

258
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,490
喺你嗰個本位上邊，你可唔可以睇到佢嘅邏輯？

259
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:03,280
即係嗰個嘅，即係個保障咧，其實就睇落去咧，就係都係誒弱咯。如果係冇咗呢個寫法嘅話，嚇。

260
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:51,260
就係而家管理局願意加合理辯解同不願意加合理辯解個理路邏輯係咩？你可唔可以可唔可以幫幫我？

261
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:24,360
嗰個嘅變價畀到佢，噉我諗係畀佢嘅誒嗰個保障咧係會大啲咯。因為如果你依度係冇寫嘅話咧，變咗管理局咧就應該可以話佢係因為冇遵從個指示。

262
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:22,250
needs to spit， you know， you do it into a handkerchief to use that example。 I think really it comes down to the this the appropriate situation in these sort of circumstances。 If we decide to prosecute， it should be left to the court to decide。

263
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:39,980
我我唔知，我想請教法律顧問，唔知你你覺得我頭先我哋嗰個誒交流，你覺得喺即係立法會嘅法委員會法律顧問嘅角度嚟睇，係點樣睇啦？我想我想聽一聽，我唔知有冇諗漏到嘢。

264
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:54,840
個噉樣嘅，即係如果佢喺呢度冇加嗰個合理辯解嘅話咧，咁變咗係咪話嗰個嘅係誒公眾人士佢其實嗰個合理嘅辯解，我諗誒相對嚟講咧，佢就已經喺嗰個法定嗰個條文度咧係冇咗呢一個噉樣嘅誒。

265
00:43:41,640 --> 00:44:01,650
係，咁即係當然，即係如果佢而家噉樣嘅寫法咧，因為嗱，因為而家咧佢有一啲其實係都會係考慮加入呢個合理辯解嘅，咁但係如果呢一度佢唔寫咧，就變咗係其實佢有個誒即係情況就係話，如果佢真係冇遵守嘅話，已經係可以係判罰佢即係所以二千元呢個。

266
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:21,660
嘅罰款嘅，因為而家有啲條文底下嗰個嘅違反咧，佢係會加入嘅，咁變咗有一個分別喺度。其實係即係我都係因為咧呢個睇翻誒，我哋最近嘅啟德遊輪嗰個嘅誒法案嗰個委員會嗰度，亦都係有啲類似關於即係誒即係話要遵守呢個通告同埋一啲指示咧，其實都會有呢一個噉樣嘅寫法喺度，所以我呢個就。

267
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:41,670
比較係都想睇下，即係管理局嗰個嘅即係講法係如何，因為都係比較係誒會有呢個嘅寫法咯嚇。啊，主席，我想再問一問法律顧問咧，即係你你睇得即係仔細啲啦，用用嘅時間一定多過我嘅。即係我想知道就係你可唔可以理順得到？

268
00:44:53,190 --> 00:45:13,200
因為咧，如果喺其他嘅條文，即係佢有啲係誒喺呢一個扶例底下咧，佢亦都係有一啲其他嘅違犯咧。佢係加入咗呢個合理嘅辯解，噉佢嗰個嘅即係誒當事人咧，如果佢係即係違反咗嘅話，噉佢就喺個法定嗰個嘅即係個法定。

269
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:44,650
而個目的係即係佢係誒冇符合到，即係不能夠去誒確保個公眾嘅安全，或者係個秩序咧。噉就已經係可以即係構成咗一個，即係佢一個係違違規嘅咯。即係如果我咁睇，因為佢呢個寫法就係有啲地方係有，有啲係冇，噉就會係即係凸顯咗呢一個其實。

270
00:45:44,650 --> 00:46:04,660
都係冇一個誒一個辯解嘅嗰個理由啦，即係如果有合理辯解，變咗喺呢度可能都已經係觸犯咗嗰個嘅規例。嗯，唔係，主席，我我我我明白，但係我想問啊法律顧問，即係以取得一啲進一步嘅協助咧，就係我相信佢有啲有，有啲冇咧係有邏輯㗎嘛。係，所以我都嗰個邏輯係咩？你你睇下。

271
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:36,650
誒都係議員，咁咧其實佢啊，即係誒管理局嗰個就係，如果即係佢當然亦都有之前佢誒即係解釋到就話，佢都會可能係考慮咗其他嘅因素啊，咁各樣嘢先至決定佢係咪即係誒會對呢個嘅有關即係違反嘅人士作出檢控啦。咁但係如果就著依一

272
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,630
yeah。

273
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,400
唔用用咧， prosecute。

274
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,530
知唔知呢樣嘢？

275
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,540
所謂strict liability嘅offence嘅，即係話。

276
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:01,350
作為我哋會簡介出嚟畀相關律師行或者律師，喺社區度，我哋唔用公訴官。

277
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:53,820
係係啦，噉就我實就未未曾問佢哋嘅法律顧問之前咧，我想問下，即係作為立法會法律顧問。

278
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:27,780
到最後上庭都會係由誒律政司負責咧，定係會由管唔係個管理局會有legal prosecute嘅？No, it would be handled by us.

279
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:35,970
因為都過咗好多時間啦，就哦唔好意思，噉我可以再排嘅，唔使再排啦。第二，我我想離席，因為我我知道呢個噉嘅問答係會不斷重複嘅。好啊，誒誒，阿楊楊鶴橋。

280
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:13,500
哦，即係，We might use Mr. Leung for example, if he would support us on this.我我有招牌，我驚阿阿梁生佢唔識做嘅。

281
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:26,620
誒，我想了解一下誒，即係係會由管理局以誒自己去揾外邊嘅誒私人嘅監控人員去做。

282
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:06,960
譬如我頭先噉樣講，你其實你哋嘅角度係我係啱定唔啱？我可能錯㗎，即係我我係我想問下啫，係啱定唔啱？因為呢個就算咁寫法都唔係一個即係strict liability offence啊嘛。

283
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:23,700
咁誒，但係我頭先就問你有冇邏輯嘅咧？佢邊啲肯加，邊啲唔肯加，你就似乎唔唔係好覺得佢嘅邏輯係好清楚啦。咁一陣間呢個機會，主席你可能畀個機會阿柏志高先生解釋啦。我諗下啊。

284
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:45,090
即係唔可能話你冇寫合理辯解咧，咁咧你就誒一定係做咗個動作就有罪㗎啦。咁即係我唔知道，我即係因為我知道西九管理局嘅法律誒顧問都喺度啦嚇，即係。

285
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:47,500
briefed out to the appropriate prosecution groups within the legal community. DOJ only deals with cases that would be prosecuted by the police, for example.明白。噉我亦都再想見，基於呢個問題，再瞭解下管理局諗住安排幾多位誒非，我唔知中文係咪lay prosecutor。

286
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:23,780
唔係主席，不如咁啦。我我想橫僑發展高先生喺度咧，即係佢可唔可以交代一下嗰個邏輯咧？嗱，因為我個理解就係噉樣，即係就算你冇寫合理辯解咧，呢一類噉樣嘅誒，即係叫做犯罪行為咧，喺法律上咧都唔會變成一個。

287
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:56,330
唔該，主席。誒，想請問管理局咧，誒喺針對即係處理呢一類型即係誒違法嘅行為嘅過程裏邊咧，管理局係嗰啲職員係會獲授權係會出告票，直接係向嗰啲即係誒有可能幹犯嚇罪行嘅人係。

288
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:16,340
出傳票啊，或者告票啊，定係係會交由誒執法人員去處理，跟住再由律政司去負責檢控嘅。好啊，得一答。Yes, we under the bylaw, we would be authorised to issue the summons. The prosecution would be dealt with either by us, or if it's a more serious offence, by the police。誒，對唔住，我驚我漏咗。咁即係話去。

289
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,660
市民受到滋擾。

290
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,210
誒，剛才係噉嘅講法，係咪啊？

291
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:36,000
佢講得好清楚啦，佢會而呢個誒將會係喺將來嘅預算嘅一部分嘅裏邊咧，我相信。

292
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:45,840
係唔係都即刻告人咧？噉樣可唔可以噉樣？嗯，Mr. Chairman， with all due respect， it's for the courts to decide whether there is a reasonable excuse or not.

293
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:39,880
Well, Mr. Chairman, as I said in my introductory remarks, we don't actually see the need for a reasonable excuse. We're prepared because members have indicated they would like it to to put it in where we think it's acceptable. But there are cases, and this is one of them, where we don't think it would be appropriate. We want our staff.

294
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:22,960
咁其實你如果咁講嘅，你條條都唔使合理辯解㗎啦。你有咩説同法官講咯？噉樣你嘅你嘅意思就係咁啫嘛。咁噉係一個咁噉係咪好擾民咧？依樣嘢係嘛？即係你唔所你需要解説啦，你同法官講啦。有大律師啊，你去請大律師啦。咁點解咧？

295
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:34,120
咁輕微嘅罪行而需要管理局動用龐大嘅資源去外聘律師或者大律師咧，其實呢個就係即係誒喺公堂上面嘅花費，我覺得就唔係好合比例。咁所以呢一個係想特別誒提出嘅啫，主席。哦，噉啊，記錄在案啦，即係同個條文就冇關嘅嚇。咁誒。

296
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:56,370
即係因為外聘誒律師呢個都可能費用唔平啦嚇。有陣時，如果你揾剛才嗰個嘅話，就一定唔平啦。Exactly，I mean，you know，no nobody wants to prosecute. Let's be quite frank about it. We would much rather，and I've said this from the day one，we'd much rather talk to people，explain to them，deal with it，deal

297
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:16,380
我明白，因為點解咧？因為其實我關注咧，就係其實誒個比例唔係好，即係唔係好成比例嘅。因為其實根據即係而家條文所講咧，相牽涉嘅嗰啲罪行其實就係好相對好輕微嘅啫。咁如果因為係要處理呢一類型。

298
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:54,410
我我都有個問題喺第一輪咧，就係頭先講翻頭先咧，即係如果你唔加入呢個咧，就令到你呢個條文咧嗰個權力好大，冇乜即係制約噉樣。譬如我睇到頭先梁議員問你嗰個對於同其他條文有冇咩衝突啊，或者相關咧，我又睇到咧就話如果有其他條文就會話。

299
00:51:54,410 --> 00:52:14,420
啊！除非合有合理辯解，但如果你想即係繞過呢個合理辯解咧，只要出一張告示出嚟噉話，噉你就可以話畀啲公眾聽嗱，我已經出咗告示啦，我唔需要你解釋啦，你接告票啦。咁當然誒，上到法庭，好似阿梁議員講都唔係一定話告得入有啲嘢，但係你都令到嗰個事。

300
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:36,250
受到，因為市民唔係咁得閒啊，要同你上法庭，又要請假，又要成噉樣。我覺得係唔係？如果你佢有一定嘅解釋，而你聽到佢解釋之後，都覺得係可以合理聽到個誒佢嘅合理化合理㗎啦。咁同埋可以誒好快脆可以解決咗個問題，你就唔使。

301
00:52:46,180 --> 00:53:06,190
We would have to, as I've indicated to to the honourable member, we would have to provide the evidence that we have that that offence has taken place. The fact that there's a reasonable excuse is something that the courts would have to judge. We would also always, before we take a decision to prosecute, listen to the individual, understand why.

302
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:26,200
They did what they did, and then still have to take a decision. It's not automatic. It's not the situation, for example, like a summons where you see something, you give them an on-the-spot position. You've got to collect the evidence. You have to present the evidence. You have to brief it out to the to a barrister or whoever to prosecute on our behalf. So the

303
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:46,210
process is very prolonged and expensive for us. So, where we feel that there is a reasonable excuse, we're prepared to put that in. And the example I've given in my introduction would be, you know, a male entering into a female toilet. A reasonable excuse was.

304
00:53:46,210 --> 00:54:06,220
我，我女兒在哭，我妻子沒在，我必須去，那完全可接受。但係在涉及公共秩序或安全問題，我們不認為我們應該考慮那，在我們有足夠證據之前採取行動。那係為什麼我們不認為有區別。在這情況，係黑或白。

305
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,200
O.K.

306
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,410
好。

307
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,740
附例規定嘅罪行咧。

308
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,380
而另外一啲咧，就唔使嘅。

309
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,790
係現場係可以有得解釋嘅。

310
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:20,320
即係叫做犯罪行為啦。

311
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,830
我諗我初初初嗰個估計都係啱嘅，即係話咧。

312
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,400
咁而個分野係咩咧？就係有一啲動作，就係。

313
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:26,130
實就唔想咧，嗰啲管理局嘅執法人員咧。

314
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:55,620
咁所以咧，其實呢個邏輯咧就係有某一啲誒嗰個。

315
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:16,710
佢就想誒，就住某一啲嘅可能誒。

316
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:05,850
喺個執法人員去執法之前，係要聽取同埋決定是否有合理辯解。

317
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:48,240
要 take that action seriously. We want safety to be number one at all times, and that must be a message both to our staff and to the members of the public.

318
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:35,890
係要誒聽取是否有合理辯解，然後先去執執行嗰個誒條例。

319
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:47,820
咁所以，我我估佢係噉嘅意思啦。即係我我試下講講論述一次啦。即係如果阿柏志高先生係唔同意我講嘅，佢可以誒去澄清啦。

320
00:54:52,630 --> 00:55:03,990
啊啊！兩位，係多謝主席。我我想都再跟一跟先啦。即係嗱，我嘅理解係噉樣啊。我如果聽完啊，白志高先生最後呢一輪嘅答案咧。

321
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,390
嘅罪行嚟嘅。

322
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:51,790
即係主席，唔好意思啊！呢個係我我我我係即係比較技術啲啦嚇。

323
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,720
嗰個叫做犯案嘅心態，即係叫做menswear。

324
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:38,210
喺刑事誒法裏邊咧，就一定唔係屬於嗰種不需要證實。

325
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,840
係由佢哋自己嘅誒，即係即係官員啦，係上庭嘅。

326
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:46,170
嗰個資格嘅，我相信誒法律顧問係知道嘅嚇。我我想聽一聽就住呢兩點，阿柏志高先生嘅回應嚇。

327
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:02,730
咁所以咧，你有冇嗰個犯罪心態咧？個menswear咧，係必須要喺庭審嘅階段由控方證明嘅。

328
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:16,440
咁當然即係誒誒，我我諗啦嚇，即係你話你次次都去外判大律師咁嚇。

329
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:29,630
有啲咧就留翻你去畀官同官講啦。嗱，因為咧，我嘅理解咧就呢一類噉樣嘅誒罪行咧。

330
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:57,620
Let me answer the second part first. I don't intend to have any in-house staff to deal with these things. I've dealt with them in housing authority, for example. We had some staff that were taking

331
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:57,190
即係誒，我唔希望會咁啦嚇。不過，即係如果真係有好大量呢一類噉樣嘅誒檢控咧，即係好似食環署咁啫嘛。食環署咧嗰啲誒，我哋叫做部門嘅傳票啊，departmental summonses。

332
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:40,410
就係呢樣嘢，我想尋求法律顧問嘅協助，或者咧誒嗰個西九管理局嘅法律顧問都可以提出你嘅講法，然後由我哋嘅法律顧問去印證嘅嚇。咁呢一點第一點啦，第二點咧，關於楊嶽橋議員提出提出嗰樣嘢咧，我我相信咧。

333
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:23,050
咁所以咧，只係你唔係冇得解，而係你係向邊個解啫？即係有啲咧，由於佢方便係在場執法咧，佢就唔想你係去擔誤嗰個執法人員，就喺現場去解。你有料嘅，你可以同個官解，因為呢啲罪行咧，我唔相信係strict liability啦。即係，但係我我。

334
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:36,730
就的確，我諗我同意楊愛橋醫院講嘅，即係呢個唔划算，都唔需要咁做啦。咁但係你如果要係自己職員誒去誒法庭去處理呢一類噉樣嘅傳票咧，你係要為特定嘅幾位職員咧係爭取出庭。

335
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:17,920
proper training, given training by Department of Justice and other people, I I really think that these will be very few in in number, and therefore I don't anticipate having in-house staff to deal with this. I I would much rather brief it out. I think it it retains an objectivity because the the briefout company can

336
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:37,930
Can advise us whether this is worth pursuing, which is another safeguard in this way. So I think that answers your question. Getting back to the first one, no, I I don't see this as a you know a blind strict liability issue. It cannot be. Of course, every situation requires an intervention, and as I said before.

337
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,130
係。

338
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:01,770
嗯。

339
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,230
我話楊學傑。

340
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:56,120
strict reasonable excuse defence in this case.

341
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:51,620
where we try to de-escalate and avoid that becoming a prosecutable offence, hence we don't feel the need for.

342
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:24,370
In this case, I really do feel that it is appropriate not to have a reasonable excuse defence because safety must be paramount.

343
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:47,230
旅行或者即係上庭嗰啲處理辦法嘅，咁誒管理局係咪都會誒承擔埋呢一部分嘅責任㗎？嚇，唔該。

344
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:38,680
都係可以減免咗咧，我相信即係將來喺管理上邊、喺執法上邊咧，即係管理局嘅嗰啲嗰啲麻煩嘅。噉啊，當然即係剛才梁家傑議員提到，即係呢個會唔會係一個strict liability咧？即係我亦都同意咧，就誒。

345
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:16,630
must always be. It's only if, as we say in other sections, it's only if there's a persistent activity which is in breach of the notice. The notice has been drawn to their attention. Then we would have to take action. But again, we'd have to provide the evidence to the court in every case, whether or not there's a reasonable excuse defence.

346
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:57,940
The first intervention will probably be at the park ambassador level. They have no jurisdiction to initiate a prosecution action. Their intervention will be: look, please stop what you're doing. There is a notice. Here's the notice. You understand why we've put that notice up? Please stop. That's the very first interaction, and it.

347
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:44,660
and I keep saying this because you know we are talking about a public park where there will be you know children there'll be adults there'll be people on bikes there'll be people playing football there'll be people playing flying a kite we need to have safety as something which is really black and white but in any case the action of prosecution comes after a series of steps.

348
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:22,060
噉啊，咁講啦，即係剛才我聽到誒行政總裁嘅講法咧，當然我就覺得咧都係有翻個合理辯解咧，就會係全面啲嘅，即係令到成個法例睇落去，同埋咧亦都係令到其他途人係會知道自己嘅權利係去到邊度，咁亦。

349
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:58,970
呢個亦都唔似，即係根據個就噉嘅drafting噉樣嘅字眼咧，亦都唔似係一個即係誒strict liability嚟嘅。咁但係始終咧有個合理辯解嘅字喺度咧，亦都即係有好多唔識法律嘅人，起碼都會知道自己有啲位就唔需要去到即係西九嘅時候就會有呢個不必要嘅懼怕，或者唔知道自己。

350
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:18,980
會唔會不必要嘅時候唔當法網咁？呢個就係一個意見啦。另外咧就係誒，其實都想進一步瞭解，如果當誒西九管理局係會係誒自己決定去揾外判嘅律師嘅話咧，如果將來真係有人佢係被即係被告啦、被控啦噉。

351
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:38,990
誒，西教管理局係咪都會接受埋呢一啲人士？佢去同你誒係商討，可唔可以唔告？即係好似律政師咧，因為而家都有噉嘅功能啦。即係有啲被告人咧，如果佢幹犯一啲相對冇咁嚴重嘅罪行，其實咧佢係可以同即係有佢嘅法律代表去同律政師去商討嗰啲罪。

352
01:02:47,520 --> 01:03:07,530
Mr. Chairman, the first one, we have actually accepted some reasonable excuse provision should be included in the bill. We're not saying in all cases there should be none. So let me just make that clear. I'm saying in this particular case, we feel it should not apply for the reasons I've explained. On the question of

353
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,770
好嘅。

354
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:42,390
啊！我我有啲問題都想問下法律顧問咧，如果佢？

355
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:46,990
誒第十二條或者其他之後咧，出現一啲噉嘅行為，佢。

356
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,480
the the the decision to prosecute is the last step in a process to try and avoid it.

357
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:54,230
所以個管理局去告人嘅時候咧，咁既然佢自己去告人咧，呢種算係一種民事定係刑事咧？

358
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:35,490
所以，那那 ability to prosecute must be here，otherwise there's no logic to the bylaw。That's that's why we have to proceed on that basis。

359
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:22,700
First point. Of course, we have provided for a reasonable excuse defence in case of the toilets. We absolutely agree with you on that point. On the second one, you know, the issue, of course, as I said before, is that.

360
01:03:54,770 --> 01:04:09,660
唔係佢呢個咧，其實喺而家嗰個咧係誒西九嗰個咧係嗰個嘅主例啦，同埋而家呢一個咧即係草擬嘅副例嗰度啦，其實亦都係賦權咗咧，就畀呢個嘅係西九管理局咧有一個咧係檢控權嘅。

361
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:27,540
討論， of course， we're always happy to discuss. And in fact， you know， it's going to cost us money to prosecute someone. If we can avoid a prosecution， then of course we would try to do so. However， the bylaw must have those provisions. Otherwise， there is there is nothing to back up the provision within the bylaw.

362
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:30,240
即係都係算一種刑事檢控㗎咯喎，都係一個係啊，都係一個刑事個檢控嚟嘅。噉係啦，咁其實頭先咧，梁家傑我都想回應翻咧，因為就算呢個誒係一個even呢個係一個即係所謂係誒strict liability嘅嗰個嘅係offence嘅話咧，其實喺一個普通法嚟講都有個係抗辯，就係話佢有一個所。

363
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:50,250
所謂誠實啦，同埋一個合理即係錯誤嗰個信念，即係理解啲事實咧，其實都可以有一個抗辯嘅。只不過，如果係套用喺呢一類噉樣嘅即係誒違規嘅情況下咧，噉就可能即係要去斟酌係咪真係可以適用咯。咁其實係有呢樣嘢，但係誒，正如頭先阿誒楊議員都提過啦。咁其實呢一個如果係寫清楚有個合理嘅辯。

364
01:04:50,250 --> 01:05:10,260
辯解咧，嗰個保障咧係會係清晰啲嘅嚇。即係我自己都同意咧，即係依個係重要嘅，加個合理辯解。即係有啲嘢你真係唔知道會犯錯，或者你解即係你你你你睇下你點解啊？譬如你話係入錯廁所，我諗冇人未試過唔入錯廁所嘅，一定會試過大個人係嘛？因為你睇唔到個嘥係嘛，有時你諗。

365
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:30,270
講緊嘢睇住手機，咁中咗入去嚇，全部女人㗎，咁先中中翻出嚟。噉你如果冇合理辯解，冇剩啦，哦，你即刻去要去罰人嘅時候咧，即係你你你起碼有機會畀人辯解你聽，即係合唔合理就你另外一件事啦，係嘛？噉你起碼連解釋都唔解釋，就叫人哋去見官，噉就我覺得。

366
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:50,280
都係有啲問題，同埋第二咧就除咗去見官之外，呢啲犯咗呢啲情況之下，有冇一啲仲裁嘅地方咧，或者係嚇調解嘅機制去大家去傾咧？如果你喺你裏邊都冇一個調解嘅機制，一下咧，尤其是呢啲公共地方好多誒普通市。

367
01:05:50,280 --> 01:06:10,290
市民佢都會出誒出入呢啲地方嘅時候咧，佢真係冇呢個法律常識，佢係驚得好緊要嘅喎。就算最後冇事嘅時候，都嚇親死啦，係嘛？噉你一喐下就去告人，噉我覺得係咪可以即係你哋有冇一啲即係調解或者仲裁嘅機制支持咧？噉樣。嗯，just to address your

368
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:48,770
having to prosecute, we we see this as really just the necessary final step. If we can't deal with a case through negotiation or discussion, that process is inherent in our approach to the management of the of the the open space. So yes, there will be a process of.

369
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,800
J。

370
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,580
I。

未獲準許，不得邀約出售或出售任何物品或服務。

375
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,130
你哋翻去再諗一諗啦。噉我哋爭論啦。噉啊，跟住落嚟係第十三點。

376
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:14,840
燒啲不得投擲石頭或投射物，或發射槍、氣槍、弓箭。

377
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:16,540
O.K.，噉我諗咧，大家都好清晰咧，我哋就希望你翻去再諗一諗啦，好嘛？噉我哋因為頭先嘅大部分議員都希望有依個噉嘅條文。

378
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:47,490
如被獲授權人士要求停止某種對任何其他人造成妨礙、妨擾或煩擾的行為，不得作出該妨擾或煩擾的行為。

381
01:06:48,770 --> 01:07:03,960
discussion between you know people who are in breach of that of these various provisions that's automatic, but there comes a point where cannot take place. You have to be able to prosecute. Hence, you have the provision to allow us to prosecute.

382
01:08:51,350 --> 01:09:08,220
如管理局已藉告示禁止在公眾休憩用地的任何部分進行球類遊戲、使用單車、滑板、滾軸溜冰鞋或其他類似的器材或設備，不得進行該等活動。

啊，唔該。

404
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,770
係，轉出去。

405
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,570
即係你嘅高度三公嘅人。

406
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,930
Flying requirements.

407
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,900
radius around that of three kilometres.

408
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,320
對依條有冇咩提問？第十三條。

409
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,070
And therefore, we have to comply with the civil aviation requirements.

410
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:33,460
你個中心點喺邊度？In this case, it would be the Suntec Centre as the centre point and

411
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:18,510
三公里範圍係，即係飛入咗你嘅範圍都係受你嘅負利所限。三公里，即係話你個範圍之外嘅三公里。

412
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:26,810
係啊，It's a radius. So, in other words, if if that's the centre point, we are.佢個半徑個圓心喺邊度？Sorry.

413
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:08,260
裏邊講呢飛行靶機同埋模型飛機，譬如啲航拍器材，其實係咪都係會受呢一條誒法例所規管到？

414
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:59,060
係誒，我想問翻K嗰度啦。K嗰度咧講緊呢啲飛行物體咧，係喺西九呢個範圍裏邊去放出嚟嘅飛行物體啊，定係個飛行物體係飛咗入去西九嘅範圍嘅上空，都已經係受呢條附例嘅規管咧？誒，裏邊。

415
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:30,980
Mr. Chairman, this is basically within the within the space that we control. We can't obviously control space outside our our area. But if the launching takes place within the district, they have to have permission. And this is purely a safety issue because we are within, I think it's three kilometres of a helicopter land.

416
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:09,800
張寶塵。

417
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,870
即係所有飛行機器。

418
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,800
not what they're doing with it.

419
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,650
主席，唔該。

420
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,480
哦，仲有冇啊？

421
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:49,070
陳月武就啊楊。

422
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,780
被禁止，我想確認呢一點嘅。

423
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,910
咁即係唔係你個問題？係。

424
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,630
If I could just interrupt just for a moment, the Department of Civil Aviation also.

425
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:38,060
Mr. Chairman, there's two distinct things. The issue isn't the photography, it's the flying device.

426
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:47,190
攝影是 irrelevant to the flying device，所以 whether it takes photographs or video is we don't have a view on that。 It's the fact that they shouldn't be flying。

427
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:23,920
呢區呢度咧，佢誒風箏同埋氣球都有個高度限制嘅。咁如果係模型飛機或者航拍機係低飛，可唔可即係有冇高度限制嘅？

428
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:38,850
誒，呢個係咪再飛行器啊？As I say, there is a general prohibition on flying aircraft on the on the harbour front. Obviously, we are simply mirroring what is in existing legislation, so I can't give you specific details beyond that.

429
01:13:49,910 --> 01:14:05,960
prohibits the flying of any model aircraft or any other sort of aircraft anywhere on the shores of Victoria Harbour. That's specifically set out in the civil aviation orders.

430
01:14:49,400 --> 01:15:07,120
好，楊國權。唔該，主席。誒，針對K咧，我即係純粹係字面上，我想了解清楚咧。誒，如果我哋睇誒，我係想問航拍機嘅。咁即係如果我哋睇英文咧，就我相信英文會容易理解。

431
01:12:46,040 --> 01:13:06,050
即係個你你。No, we are within a three-kilometre radius from, for example, in in our case, it's the Macau ferry terminal. There is a a helicopter landing pad on the top, which is used very frequently, and therefore we have to comply with the the civil aviation.

432
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,200
嗯。

433
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:11,720
嘅，我就係想確認一下，當我覺得被滋擾嘅時候，我向管理局嘅職員投訴。

434
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:57,220
嗱，因為主席點解我特別攞第十一齣嚟講咧？因為第十一嗰個咧就係誒。

435
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:37,550
畀埋啲例子，咁市民會容易理解咧。誒，呢個第一點啦。第二就另一個題目就針對G嗰度啦。誒，G嘅意思咧？

436
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:24,280
gentleman, can I just answer the first part? If they want permission, they have to go to the civil aviation department to fly. They wouldn't come to us, so that's the first part. On G.

437
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:07,990
啊，都唔可以啦！將佢即係任何飛行拍攝咧，佢就自己揾個雲梯擔梯、擔天梯上去咯。如果唔係咧，佢就揾呢啲航拍機咧，佢已經係違反嗰個依依條例㗎啦，企依條例。

438
01:17:56,690 --> 01:18:12,570
噉你哋作出警告，噉佢就必然係要遵守，而不需要去理會咧本身呢個提出誒complain嘅呢個人佢嘅呢個投訴咧係咪真係合理咧？定係局方自己都要去考慮呢個係咪真係qualify誒，即係nuisance或者係noise咧？

439
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:55,820
個飛行器我嚟做乜嘢咧？噉就係另外一件事啦。但係而家佢話直情係唔可以飛高過誒，即係五十誒十米。噉我去，如果十米之內可以。唔係啊，主席，個個如果就咁睇K嘅話咧，誒飛行器咧就唔關高度事添。

440
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:56,090
係咪即係任何人士，即係任何誒喺嗰度嘅公眾人士？如果佢向執法，即係或者去局方誒表示佢係受騷擾，而如果局方係向其該名騷擾中人啊，即係誒當事人咧，應該話。

441
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:27,410
但係如果去到中文咧，就電動飛行靶機咧就未必一般市民會明白嘅，主席。嗱，因為我睇到呢一段之後咧，我同一時間注意到第十一誒section十一嗰度咧，就話係唔容許拍攝㗎嘛。噉係咪即係其實航拍機都必然係？

442
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:17,760
除非有準許先至可以去拍任何即係攝影啊，或者即係嗰類型啦。咁因為而家航拍機當然都係誒可能都係會喺商業都唔定㗎嘛。噉我就想確認啫，係咪第一咧就係如果有誒局方嘅準許咧，就可以有航拍呢個？

443
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:37,770
係咪可以嘅？唔得啦，因為依個飛行器依度。The the problem is that that we have to comply with the civil aviation department requirements. If the civil aviation department says you cannot fly on the waterfront, they cannot fly. Nothing to do with us, and that we're just replicating that.我諗都好清晰㗎啦。依個都係講飛行器。

444
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:28,730
跟住我，純粹一個建議啫，即係因為針對K咧，我頭先啱啱第一下就亦都講咗嗰個建議，因為飛行打機咧對好多即係市民未必會理理解嘅，咁可能喺將來法例呢個都，我覺得都可以接受，但係可能去到實體真係出告示嘅時候，可能可以即係。

445
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:44,570
As we say, it's causing a nuisance after being requested to desist. It's not an automatic action. The whole purpose of our approach is, if if someone complains, we speak to them. We say, please look. If you want to play football here, it's dangerous because there are children nearby. Could you move across there? We don't take action.

446
01:18:44,570 --> 01:19:04,580
自動化地，just to say no， it's not our approach。我我已經ready do that in the existing nursery park， and it works very well。我我明白呢一點嘅主席，但係我就係想澄清一下咧，即係有陣時你都知有啲市民咧，佢可能佢作佢覺得被騷擾咧，嗰個嗰個程度咧，大家人人唔同。

447
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:32,010
呢個管理局嘅職員應該自己佢會去衡量，即係究竟我呢個投訴係唔係真係合理㗎嘛？我就係想確認呢一點啫，係嘛？Yeah, of course. And that's that's the job of the staff on the ground. They've got to react to a dynamic situation. If there is no threat, if there's no danger, then of course

448
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:52,020
會 be a matter of saying look, this person is is concerned by what you're doing. Would you please move and do it in some other location? There are many ways to deescalate a situation, and that's the training we're giving our staff. We're trying always to ensure that if there's a bit of a conflict, there's a compromise solution. That's the far by far the

449
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,530
兩家概念。

450
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,040
主席，我我就。

451
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,040
best way to approach these situation.

452
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,010
即係其他全部都冇嘅。

453
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,590
即係講廁所嗰度啊！

454
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:07,380
即係理據喺度嘅，就係咧，當你一套符例。

455
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:39,150
喺理解上咧，就會當咧，即係或者唔好當啦，或者佢傾向就係唔畀人解釋。

456
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:04,740
主席啊，即係我就唔係特別有興趣講呢個K，不過咧，即係你。

457
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:33,620
噉我覺得好奇怪咧，就合理辯解咧，淨係喺第十六條有嘅啫。

458
01:20:53,690 --> 01:21:02,120
點解公廁係咁特別咧？嗱，因為咧，法律顧問其實係有有一個誒。

459
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:26,870
即係頭先誒嗰段時間咧，我就睇咗一籌成份呢一個西九嗰個附例咧。

460
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:15,290
用頭先我哋講嘅合理辯解嗰樣嘢咧，噉我作為法律顧問，跟住下一個問題，你叫我哋注意咧，就係點解唔喺括弧二咧加埋合理辯解嗱？

461
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:32,590
就會令到其他冇嘅，即係冇合理辯解啊！呢一個噉嘅誒寫落去嗰個附例裏邊嘅條文咧。

462
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:20,190
係有一啲，或者喺呢個例子度就有一種情況，就係公廁係有，而其他都冇咧。咁當個法庭去理解呢套法例嘅時候咧？

463
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:53,320
咁咧就同埋咧，我亦都用咗啲時間咧睇咗個海洋公園個附例咧，全條附例都冇合理辯解嘅，啊，咁噉我又想問下柏志高先生。

464
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:59,440
你明嘛，主席？即係我想覺得，我想發展高先生解釋一下點解佢對公廁情有獨鍾係要加呢一呢一個呢一個合理辯合法辯解裏。不你冇咗，其實仲好。你冇咗咧，就大家就去法庭解啦嘛。噉就冇即係口齒。

465
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:33,310
咁呢一套符例咧？

466
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,020
Why would there be a reasonable excuse for that?

467
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,900
其餘嗰啲冇嘅，噉你會點理解咧？

468
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:37,510
有七八個就有合理辯解嘅。

469
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:31,080
我即係我我同個柏志高先生傾下啫，即係如果你當你自己係裁判法官。

470
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:14,580
嗱，主席，我OK，我我係睇漏咗啊！即係原來佢咧係誒加咗好多合理變價喺其他地方啊，除咗公廁之外。

471
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:49,250
no exceptions. So we are we we we have moved on those areas where we believe it is appropriate to have a reasonable excuse concession.

472
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:25,510
咁但係噉係解決唔到我嘅問題，即係因為咧個問題係噉啊！而家你譬如你係個裁判法官啦。

473
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:12,010
我又聽得唔係好清楚嗱。如果你話好似海洋公園咁咧，我啊反而冇問題喎。你全部都冇噉，即係全部都冇咧，噉就一視同仁啦。噉樣嚇，即係嗰啲例我講。

474
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:25,810
一視同例啊！但係而家變咗唔係，咁變咗你嗰個邏輯就要解得好清楚先得。如果唔係咧，我哋通過咗一份噉樣嘅附例咧，將來我就要憂慮嗰個法庭點樣理解佢啊！

475
01:22:49,530 --> 01:23:05,700
但我們相信，特別係喺呢個case，為什麼你會有合理嘅理由亂丟垃圾？為什麼你會有合理嘅理由唔要得到民航局嘅許可去飛一架飛機，去飛一架飛機？所以，我哋喺個區別喺個case by case basis，正如應該嘅。

476
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:43,390
尤其是理解嗰啲冇合理辯解嗰啲條文。係。嗯，Mr. Chairman，I think there's a couple of things here. First, of course, the court's going to listen to every excuse. They have no choice. That's a fact of life. And I'm sure the honourable member knows it better than I do. So I don't think that's an issue. Um, as

477
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:19,450
薄皮或者有不同嘅待遇啊嘛，但係你而家就係唯獨是十六條有，其他所有條文都冇，咁咧作為一法律理解咧，就會有產產生個疑問喺度，可唔可以主席你請佢解釋下？Sorry, Mr. Chairman, perhaps the honourable member wasn't in when I made my opening remarks. We have actually con

478
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:39,460
承認，那我們會把它放到第72、84、99、109、174、222、233和6的例外。我們指出的例外包括112、123、183和238，我們認為這已經夠清楚了，應該。

479
01:23:41,270 --> 01:24:01,280
即係你係作為裁判法官咧，梗係理解。咁其他啲係我唔聽啦。即係連你去庭審階段咧，我都唔聽你有咩理由㗎啦。噉啊，當然佢唔應該噉。不過咧，即係你你寫成咁咧，我作為立法者嘅角度咧，我都要諗啊嘛。即係你點解有一啲有，有啲冇？噉我接唔接受你嘅邏輯咧？咁嗱，你嘅邏輯咧？

480
01:24:43,750 --> 01:25:03,760
The legal adviser herself said there's a general provision within common law of reasonable excuse. So the question is, do we need to put it in here? And we've taken the view in some cases, of course we can, but in some cases, and this is one example, where the issue is black and white. If someone comes in and puts rubbish on the ground,

481
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,170
係。

482
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,810
Pick up your rubbish.

483
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,310
似就真係屋都冇得住。

484
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,300
但，如果某人來，和是 disposing of， let's say a vehicle。

485
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:27,140
required， and as we said， all of our staff are trained in de-escalation approach， not in confrontation.

486
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:54,770
We looked at, you cited yourself the the Ocean Park bylaw. You could talk about some of the other bylaws that we've made reference to.

487
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:09,360
as a as a rule, we've not prosecuted anybody. In fact, so far, the reality is that we always talk to them and say, look.

488
01:25:55,130 --> 01:26:04,980
Kaduri Farm Bylaw doesn't have it. They're all subsidiary legislation at the end of the day, so you have to question whether it's necessary in subsidiary legislation, and that's the approach we're taking.

489
01:26:46,040 --> 01:27:00,160
告唔到佢㗎嘛？你解釋咗之後，你覺得佢唔合理，咪繼續告佢咯？噉我係咪可以加依條咧？嚇，啊，發言者講先啦。嗯，Mr. Chairman， that's absolutely right， and that's exactly the way we already administer the park. We don't prosecute.

490
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:26,570
We believe that that's the appropriate way, and we're happy to debate each one as we go forward. In an which is the appropriate way to deal with these things, so we can take take a view. But you know, the general principle of having an excuse for whatever you do is there anyway. So the question is, do you need to reinforce that? And in

491
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:46,580
In some cases, perhaps you can. But you know, our starting position, and you know, I have to give this to the honourable member, is that when we first, when I first responded to this in writing, we said we don't believe it should be in here. It's a pretty new development, as members will recall. This is not something that's established in many of the bylaws that exist.

492
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:26,030
主席，你畀我轉跟跟多轉，因為我再排，我再排。我我我我我我講問一問啦，我再排。係因為有時候咧，即係好似你你以前房屋署都係噉嘅，即係點不罰人咧？人哋佢個袋度跌咗張紙，你就垃圾藏足。咁其實佢可能銀袋又好袋得唔好跌咗出嚟，咁可能人哋張紙有用㗎嘛。

493
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:46,040
係嘛？人哋都即時執翻，你都唔畀人哋執翻啦。因為你冇合理辯解依個條文咧，你又唔使解釋啦，你見官啦係嘛？咁如果我有合理辯解，喂，我自己跌出嚟咗，我即時已經執翻咯喎。咁呢啲即係已經證明係我有用嘅嘢，就唔係一定係呢啲liter啦、垃圾啦係嘛？噉你你畀人哋個機會解解釋，你解釋都唔係等於你。

494
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:36,860
There's very little doubt that if they leave the vehicle there for three, four, five, six days, that has to be dealt with. So where's the reasonable excuse? So that's the distinction we're making. The first step in all of these interventions is to deal with the situation on the ground. If someone drops a piece of paper, ask him to pick it up. Far better solution.

495
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:57,460
唔係啊啊啊啊！柏志哥，你你你講啊，梗係咁啦！你而家又好好啊，但係喺執行上咧，嗰啲職員咧就未必好似你咁仁慈啊！尤其是我以前即係喺屋村裏邊嗰啲管理員咧，佢都係誒唔使講啦，我就即刻抄咗你身份證先啦啊！噉啊，分分就扣扣扣十扣七分，扣得兩。

496
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:19,600
當時都係噉嘅情況出現。咁如果你有個合理辯解，噉佢即刻可以辯解嘛？如果你冇合理辯解嘅時候，執行嘅人員佢未必可，未必需要跟你咁講控人詞，一定要做咗呢個步驟嘅喎。因為呢個唔係物事，唔係一定要做啊嘛。Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I think it comes down to the training.

497
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,790
好收啦。

498
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,330
噉你都要講㗎。

499
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,410
好啊！如果講咗就真係唔～

500
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,870
O.K.噉啊，梁家傑。

501
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:41,950
上嗰個嘅係一個嘅係誒，即係許可係無關嘅話咧。

502
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:47,150
誒變咗，如果佢有合理辯解咧，都未必，未必係即係一個合法辯解嚟嘅。

503
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:40,500
嗱，咁主席或者我調翻轉頭嚟問啦，咁喺呢度落合法辯解得唔得？有咩分別啊？喺呢條。

504
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:54,570
主席啊，誒嗱，我唔係讀法律嘅，我我亦都即係從來唔想停嚇。

505
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:54,680
即係，所以其實兩者係有分別。嗰個合法辯解其實嗰個範圍係窄嘅，而合理辯解係闊嘅。咁其實係有分別嘅。

506
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:49,590
噉啊！頭先講咗啦，不如嗰登勤誒講，可唔可以熱絡合合法辯解唔好，由你辯解啦。

507
01:28:54,870 --> 01:29:08,520
我哋法律顧問咧，可唔可以解釋畀我哋聽咧？合法辯解同合理辯解有咩分別啊？因為其實我留意到第十六條嗰度咧，講緊用誒洗手間咧，其實係用合法辯解。

508
01:30:49,870 --> 01:31:05,060
Lawful excuse is narrower than than reasonable excuse, as the as the legal adviser has advised. I'm not sure lawful excuse would be appropriate in this case at all, to be honest with you, as we don't see reasonable excuses appropriate in this case either.

509
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:45,220
There's a very different mentality and approach, and I'm not speaking in theoretical terms here. I'm talking in practical terms based on our experience over the last eight months in the nursery park, where we've not had any of these provisions. We've had to address it in this way, and I can assure you that it is working very well.

510
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:37,410
咁如果合法辯解咧，的確係要有一個係誒法律上咧，即係佢係有一個即係誒lawful authority，即係有一個係佢係嗰個法律上去容許去做嘅。而合理辯解係可以包括合法辯解，但係咧合理辯解其實個範圍咧係大過合法辯解嘅。咁所以變咗咧，如果嗰樣嘢係同嗰個係法律上，

511
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:14,970
噉，比如喺第十六條嗰度咧，男人入女廁，女人入男廁。我諗，我哋講到嗰度先再講好嘛。我哋講翻。唔係唔係，主席，即係其實咧，因為呢個係相當原則性嘅。我相信啊，梁家傑議員提出同埋西九畀我哋嗰份文件咧，佢都consist咗，即係有幾條嗰度加埋合理辯解啊嘛嚇。點解佢有時即係？

512
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,260
呃。

513
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,260
嗯。

514
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,060
呃。

515
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,990
是 exercising my mind.

516
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,580
If you concede.

517
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,090
without the phrase without reasonable excuse。

518
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,430
to include reasonable.

519
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,330
Allow me, Chairman, to engage Mr. Peskott in English.

520
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:50,260
呃，such phrases in all the sections.

521
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:21,930
Mr. Pescott, I am sure you understand what.

522
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:45,200
I would rather that you, like the Ocean Park by law, do away with all.

523
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:14,470
Now, as a matter of legal interpretation, that will cause some problems.

524
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:50,170
to it being being included in sections seven, two, eight, four, nine, nine, ten, nine, seventeen, four, twenty, two, two, twenty-three, three and six.

525
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:37,690
Of course, there are pros and cons about including or excluding such a phrase without reasonable excuse.

526
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:25,380
When whoever is prosecuted under those other sections to go before a court and try to explain to the magistrate.

527
01:31:50,980 --> 01:32:05,560
That immediately flexes up a difference between these sections and other sections that you do not include the without reasonable excuse phrase.

528
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:34,980
即喺呢度，佢又肯加合理邊解噉，但係喺嗰度又又用合法辯解咧。噉我哋可唔可以即係早啲，即係講得翻清楚呢個原則嘅問題？我諗講翻呢條先啦。如果噉樣講就誒跳咗兩三條，唔係咁好啦，好嘛？我哋記低啊，陣間我哋都要去解釋啦。咁呢度係咪可？

529
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,890
before。

530
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,100
要走那那路。

531
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:09,910
Explanation.

532
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,830
Well，呃，Chairman，allow me。

533
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:35,880
Any clear, logical.

534
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,260
and the logic behind such an explanation.

535
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,530
That phrase in some, but not other sections.

536
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:51,640
The phrase without reasonable excuse and those that they do not.

537
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:32,550
因為所以 far我沒聽過從Mr. Pescott Chairman。

538
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,810
你see，if you do this，you have to give us a very clear。

539
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:56,620
rather than in introducing that clause.

540
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:59,040
Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Chairman, in fact, the honourable member is quite right. Our view is there should be no reasonable excuse.

541
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:47,330
articulate reason for drawing the distinction between those sections that they concede they would introduce.

542
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:11,460
We accept that position entirely. The reason that we've suggested these these sections could be is because we believe that there is a distinction between those where there is, in our view.

543
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:27,640
We as legislators should endorse such an approach. All right, so that I hope explains my concern, which is a concern of some principle or of principle.

544
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:31,750
There should be no dispute as to whether someone is in contravention or not, and therefore no reasonable excuse. But we agree with the honourable member, and in fact in our written submission we did make that point. We feel that it would be far preferable to be consistent throughout the the bylaw. So we're happy.

545
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,320
嗯。

546
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:00,000
其實呢個係唔公平。

547
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:16,320
The two different approaches. Absolutely. Thank you.

548
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,800
And that, Mr. Chairman, is why we would rather go without.

549
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:47,180
to some extent，because you are deciding that。

550
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:21,170
provisions exactly the same as as the honourable member has suggested, which is why.

551
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:55,880
not between the individuals on the ground. That already happens. So the question is.

552
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:42,880
If you go about it in such a haphazard manner, you are actually usurping the function of the magistrate.

553
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:29,860
睇下派幾多有冇可唔可考慮嘅嘢。嗯，Mr. Chairman，In fact, sorry, but I would reverse the logic of that, in that the sense that

554
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:13,060
You introduce without reasonable excuse to all provisions, or you don't, because as I said, there must be pros and cons about.

555
01:34:47,820 --> 01:35:03,000
In respect of some of the offences here, there could be no reasonable excuse. Whereas others, there could be reasonable excuses. Then in that sense, you are usurping the function of the court. So I would rather you go either way.

556
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:57,570
員嘅訓練同埋對呢啲法例執行嘅時候嘅認識程度咧，一定唔夠警察咁深刻嘅呢呢樣嘢，即係理論上係嘛？噉你你自己去執行嘅時候，你唔畀機會市民再畀一個解釋咧？

557
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:48,670
It's after we failed to understand why a particular offence has been committed by an individual. Would we then prosecute? The reasonable defence referred to in this bylaw refers to a reasonable defence within the courts.

558
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:42,140
即係，所以我我哋都唔，我我我想講幾句啦。我都覺得大家都同意話冇啊。我寧願你全部都有合理辯解，因為個原因就係好簡單，因為你你哋嘅你哋係由你職員去執行呢個法例，唔係由警察或者係政府嘅人員去執行呢啲法例咧。你哋嗰個職

559
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:20,790
嚇！你因為你你你受咗幾多訓練咧，我都唔唔明。你個個大事好，管理人員又好，你警起碼唔係警察嚟㗎嘛？嗰個佢你你變咗，我覺得咧，所以我覺得咧，寧願你全部都有合理辯解咧，咁對市民就會公道啲咯。嚇，對啊，係啊。

560
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:16,170
Should we give the court that opportunity to consider a reasonable defence? That's the distinction that we're talking about. You're absolutely right. I don't particularly want my staff to be having to take those judgements. I much rather leave that to the court, and the best way to do that is not to have this provision, but to make all of the different.

561
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,150
好啊，有冇得？

562
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:23,100
標語牌或告示。

563
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:11,820
禁十四禁止行為。

564
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,760
第四步，保護公眾休憩用地及環境。

565
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:55,590
二不得在公眾休憩用地內派發任何。

566
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,790
住設物或裝飾物的任何部分，張貼任何膠貼。

567
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:47,400
and that's why I don't want them to have that access. So I agree with you entirely, Mr. Chairman.

568
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:46,640
二任何人違反第一款，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

569
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:42,070
四不得在公眾休憩用地生火、燒烤或以其他方式烹煮食物。

570
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:34,760
B不得移走、幹擾、破壞或傷害任何在公眾休憩用地的樹木或植物。

571
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:50,710
二不得餵字或試圖餵字，在公眾休憩用地內飼養或發現的野生動物或鳥類。

572
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:56,690
唉，噉我哋嘅表達咗我哋嘅意見，你翻去諗諗先啦，好唔好啊？噉我哋跟住下一條啦，第十四條禁止行為。

573
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:27,120
任何人未獲準許，不得移走、幹擾、破壞或損壞在公眾休憩用地的任何部分的任何設備、器械、裝裝置、固定附著物或設施。

574
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:39,670
或F不得移走、置換或以其他方式幹預管理局在公眾休憩用地內所提供的任何救生設備，但使用此等設備於以設以公的用途除外。

575
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:41,460
In our view, it's better to be consistent and say it's the same. Doesn't matter whether it's under nine three or six four or whatever. It's the same approach. So that's why we would prefer. I think the concern the the chairman has and it's quite right is should our staff be taking a decision on whether a defence is correct or not? And of course they shouldn't.

576
01:38:55,870 --> 01:39:15,880
張貼標語牌或告示，亦不得在公眾休憩用地內的任何樹木或植物上，或在公眾休憩用地內或圍繞公眾休憩用地的任何建築物、欄杆、長椅、座椅、閘門、牆壁或其他構築物。

577
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:31,300
附例所提出修正案嘅嘅稿嚇，因為今日都係冇嗰個改改咗嘅稿。

578
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:38,750
下次嘅會議日期咧就係五月十七號晏晝四點至六點嚇，啊下次會議見，好多謝。

579
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:24,620
咧就今誒今日討論完咗之後咧，我哋會請西九管理局就呢啲法律誒就委員同埋法律顧問今日出席嘅關注嘅問題咧，提供嘅書面嘅答覆啦。咁請西九管理局咧就提交誒。

580
01:39:49,740 --> 01:40:09,750
咧，噉我哋就喺度停一停，好嘛？咁咧就因為主要就係我唔係唔想延長時間，因為下一個會咧就接得好近，因為你知道而家個情況咧，咁所以我哋都誒而家暫停個會議，好嘛？下一次會議咧，我哋就繼續誒討論呢個條文，噉。
