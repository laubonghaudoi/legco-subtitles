Over the past 17 years, the compound annual growth of air cargo throughput HKI is 6%.

Thank you。好啊，誒，因為啊隔離方又要投票，噉啊又要停多五分鐘。

Further development of HKIA will not only contribute to the city's economy, but will also drive job creation.

Good morning. Cathay Pacific Services Limited supports the building of the three runway system of Hong Kong International Airport.

13
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:23,450
With passenger traffic and flight movements consistently growing, we see a pressing need to speed up all infrastructure development at HKIA.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:17,110
香港， on the other hand, is facing anticipated runway capacity challenge, which limits airlines' abilities to secure preferred takeoff and landing time slots.

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:49,570
HKIA has established an enviable international reputation since it since it opened in 1998. In view of approaching the maximum runway capacity, we see the need to enhance the city's infrastructure and build a third runway as soon as possible to maintain the hub status and competitiveness.
