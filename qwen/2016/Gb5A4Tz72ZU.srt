15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:37,000
We've looked at it again, and we understand that members are concerned about providing for that. I understood the honourable member's comments about all or nothing. So, what we've decided to do is that rather than resist this, we're just going to accept the list that the.

可由管理局在切實可行的範圍內，盡快以售賣或其他方式處置。

59
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:09,320
管理局財產而不受一切權利及產權負擔的影響，而管理局可直售賣或其他方式處置該財物。

60
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:29,910
邊位講？等佢。Mr. Chairman, yes, we have agreed to provide family toilets, and of course, in that case, it's not specified for male or female; it's for a family situation. So these provisions wouldn't necessarily apply in respect of entering into a family toilet.

61
00:06:51,830 --> 00:07:11,840
係陳志全。誒，我記得我哋早前討論過就係西九會唔會有無分性別嘅洗手間？噉我記得誒有關嘅誒負責人係答會有嘅，係咪？我想釐清呢樣嘢。咁如果喺無分性別嘅洗手間裏邊，係咪就冇呢相關嘅任何？

62
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:16,390
第十七條遺失或誤放的財物：一、任何人在公眾休憩用地取得看來是遺失或誤放的財物的管有，須在切實可行的範圍內，盡快將該財物交予獲授權人士；二、如管理。

63
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:58,700
或B，如屬任何其他情況，可由管理局在管理局或獲授權人士取得管有後保留該財物，為期三個月。如三個月期限屆滿後，該財物仍無人認領，則該財物須當作成為管。

64
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:30,120
第三款，管理局無需因作為任何遺失或誤放的財物的受寄人或其他身份而就該財物對任何人承擔法律責任，而任何人不得就該財物向管理局申索賠償、申索損害賠償。

65

好啦，主任。

66
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,640
啊！

67
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,100
就唔使上嚟啦。

68
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,970
指引嗰度自己行嚇。

69
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,550
行政上邊出解決呢個問題。

70
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,890
O.K.有冇提問對呢個？

71
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,320
如果冇問題咧，我哋進入第十八條。

72
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,310
We would be able to deal without without the need for a bylaw.

73
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,870
the the the reason that we we need it this way is that we need to have the right to dispose of it.

74
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,090
詳細講，嗯，主多謝主席。第八步係關於車輛嘅。

75
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:10,640
誒，各位同事認為依個冇問題啊嘛嚇，即係依個佢諗住就喺自己嘅內部嗰個。

76
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:41,380
第四款，任何人無合理辯解而違反第一款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

77
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:33,170
主席，那些是程序上的問題，我唔覺得需要喺《條例》入面。當然，如果有人上來證明，我們會會睇佢嘅

78
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:22,680
可以即係開出一啲佢所認為合理嘅離上之後咧，就喺扣除一啲即係出售同埋處置失物嘅一切開支之後咧，誒咁而將誒有關嘅得益咧，就係畀翻呢一個噉樣嘅原先嘅擁有人咧嚇。

79
00:10:44,400 --> 00:11:00,080
once we've disposed of it, how we use the the income from that is is really open to us, and it could be, you know, it could be something where the value of the disposal is is negligible, or even negative exactly.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:09,010
誒都係主席嘅噉，其實喺十七條咧，需唔需要加入一個條文咧？就係話規定喺管理局出售或者係處置生物後一段時間之內，誒咁嗰個生物嘅原先嘅擁有人啦，或者之前對嗰個生物有實益權益嘅人，如果證明到佢擁有權啦，而又或管理局接納嘅話咧，咁會唔會咧？即係管理局可？

81
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,540
OK，啊，馬逢國。

82
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,280
誒，多謝主席。我想問一問咧，即係。

83
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,860
緊急服務車輛（emergency vehicle）。

84
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,580
O.K.誒，各位同事有冇提問？對於第十八條。

85
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,200
噉我想問下，如果佢可唔可以攜自己攜帶呢個單車咧？啊！

86
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,740
D正在執行他或他的職責的獲授權人士。

87
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,110
Yes, bicycles. We will actually both allow bicycles and provide. That's not a motor vehicle.

88
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:12,550
第三款，任何人無合理辯解而違反第一款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

89
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:15,000
咁譬如話類似LCSD啊，你維園誒城市論壇噉，可能佢都會畀啲嘉賓嗰啲車咧係進入嗰啲場地。咁類似噉嘅情況咧，如果根據呢個條例咧，

90
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:23,990
第四款，在本條中，汽車（motor vehicle）具有道路交通條例第三七四章第二條所給予的含義。

91
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:56,340
指由任何下列人士駕駛的車輛：A. 正在執行他或他作為警務人員的職責的警務人員。

92
00:11:47,180 --> 00:12:02,160
二第一款不適用於A子宮運載無活動能力人士或傷殘人士之用的動力輪椅或其他類似的設備，或B緊急服務車輛。

93
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:40,530
停車場car park指由管理局指定為停車場的任何區域，而該區域是向公眾開放，不論是否直接由管理局營運或由其他人營運，亦不論是否徵收泊車費用。

94
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:14,380
B正在為生病或受傷的人提供交通服務的救護服務的成員；C在緊急情況下提供交通服務的消防緊急救援或支援服務的成員，或民眾安全服務隊的隊員。

95
00:13:47,560 --> 00:14:04,690
如果喺一啲特定嘅情況，或者日子，或者一啲特別嘅誒活動咧，咁其實好多時咧都會誒，可能都係通過譬如話管理局嘅安排，係容許一啲誒機動車啊或者汽車咧係進入嗰個場地嘅。

96
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:46,680
第十八條禁止汽車進入一除在公眾休憩用地內的停車場外，任何人未獲準許，不得將汽車駕進或帶進，或安排將該汽車駕進或帶進公眾休憩用地。

97
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,840
O.K.

98
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,430
括弧一條。

99
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,190
O.K.，係。

100
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,460
第十九適宜。

101
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,170
我諗第十九條有冇提問啊？

102
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,230
如果冇咧，就二十條。第二十條。

103
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,270
第一條，OK，係任何人未經準許。

104
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,230
馬宇文解答到啦嘛，OK，下一條啦嚇。

105
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,940
撥出並指定為指定道路的任何土地。

106
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,490
for the setting up of a stage, we have to allow for those vehicles, so we will be able to give permission for that to happen.

107
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:22,830
第三七四章第二條所給予的涵義，指定道路（designated road）只由管理局根據第二十。

108
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:33,320
Okay, I'm sorry. Can you point out which clause? Section eighteen, subsection one. Yeah, a person must not drive, bring or cause to be driven or brought any motor vehicle into a public open space without permission.

109
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:10,760
on duration of time that they could remain within the site, etc. The whole logic of this is that basically we don't want vehicles in the park or open space, but we recognise that at some time we need to have them. So, for example, if someone has a delivery,

110
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:35,290
誒管理局都冇權咁做嘅，因為你冇嗰個法定嘅權力畀佢咁做啊嘛。咁呢度會唔會係有咗一啲有少少疏漏咧？即係起碼應該係一種噉嘅特殊情況咧，應該係授權管理局係可以作出呢啲噉樣嘅誒誒安排嘅。Okay，啊，好。Mr. Chairman，in in fact，if I can draw your attention。

111
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:55,300
to the wording without permission, that gives us permission to allow for these other vehicles to come into the into the park and the open space areas. So there is a permit system that will be put in place to allow people to bring vehicles in. But in doing so, of course, we would apply restrictions on speed restrictions.

112
00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:13,030
跟住我哋去到第九步，公共交通十九適宜在本部中，公共服務車輛public service vehicle具有道路交通條例第三七四章第二條所給予的含義。私家巴士private bus具有道路交通條例。

113
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,130
C。

114
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,770
三。

115
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,470
二。

116
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,620
公共服務車輛及私家巴士。

117
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,750
認為合適，並不是指明的時間內。

118
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,970
好誒，各位同事對第二二十條有冇提問？

119
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,190
在經以下列明的變通後，適用於公眾休憩用地。

120
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,860
A對路或道路的提述，包括指定道路。

121
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:58,280
任何人在無合理辯解的情況下，違反適用於本附例之下的公眾休憩用地的道路交通公共服務車輛規例。

122
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:26,030
在應用第三十一及三十二條時，凡提述警務處處長，需解釋為提述警務處處長或西九文化區管理局。

123
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:12,030
第三七四章附屬法例D第三十三、三十四、三十五或三十六條的任何條文或規定，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第二級罰款。

124
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:11,600
B除司段另有規定外，凡提述處長需解釋為提述運輸處處長或西九文化區管理局聯同運輸處處長及。

125
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:22,330
二管理局可決定公共服務車輛及私家巴士可使用指定道路的用途和條件，及可使用根據第一款指定的土地的條件。

126
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:45,610
如果冇咧，我哋繼續二十一條。第二十一條道路交通公共服務車輛規例的適用一道路交通公共服務車輛規例第三七四章附屬法例D第四部。

127
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:45,310
在就指定道路應用經第一款變通的道路交通公共服務車輛規例第三七四章附屬法例D第四部分第四部時，可由獲授權人士執行有關條文。

128
00:16:43,180 --> 00:17:03,190
一管理局可撥出在公眾休憩用地內的任何土地，並指定該等土地為指定道路，供公共服務車輛及私家巴士使用。有關使用須為管理局認為合適並不時指明的用途，及於管理局。

129
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,030
好。

130
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,850
嗯。

131
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,300
O.K.有冇提問？

132
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,600
都係指唔同嘅地方。

133
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,970
好啊，啊，翻嚟講埋一啲題目。

134
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,360
好啊，唔該，再冇提問，各位。

135
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,000
of the site where there is an interface between our site and the public roads.

136
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,210
用地的任何碼頭、特提、棧橋或船澳。

137
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,390
O.K.嚇，第廿一條咧，大家同事有冇咩提問？

138
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,910
個嘅係誒指指明嘅道路啊，還是係公眾休憩用地？因為喺用詞上面咧，就唔係好統一嘅。

139
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,900
第二，任何人無合理辯解而違反第一款，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

140
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:35,020
其他同事係啊，同同埋其他道路誒喺呢個三七四章底下嘅道路交通條例同埋其他嘅附屬法例都係會適用於呢一個嘅誒指明道路誒以及公眾休憩用地係係咪噉樣嚇？

141
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:54,810
That's the problem. We have to be able to do that as necessary. So, for example, if we designate a drop-off and pick-up point for taxis or public-like vehicles, we need to be able to apply the public the the cap 374 requirements in terms of signage to the public open space. So, yes, it applies in both cases.

142
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:45,260
誒，關於第二十一條嗰個咧嘅用字嗰度咧，因為咧喺第二十一條嘅第一款咧就係講係公眾休憩用地嘅，咁然後去到呢一個嘅第二款咧就用咗係指明道路，咁去到第三款咧又用翻咧公眾休憩用地，咁呢個係咪即係管理局可以澄清其實你係指緊？

143
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:12,510
Mr. Chairman, this is a peculiarity of the nature of the site. We will have areas which adjacent to public roads, laybys, which will be within the open space. So we have to provide for the equivalence in terms of the road traffic ordinance to cover those layby spaces. So it's a it's a peculiar requirement just because of the nature.

144
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,080
係。

145
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,210
okay。

146
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,300
大家有冇提問？

147
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,640
唔。

148
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,280
表明其真確地址。

149
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,690
你話係咪？

150
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,030
其任何部分相關的職責或工作。

151
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:44,020
係啊，法律顧問。主誒多謝主席。咁呢個遊樂船隻嘅定義係需唔需要係作出界定咧？嚇。

152
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,820
根據第二款作出的要求，或管理局根據第八一條所展示的告示。

153
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:09,630
Plundercraft is quite clearly marked by special numbers and things, so it's easy enough to pick out. No, no special definitions needed.

154
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:00,280
No definition is required. The definition of pleasure craft is set out in the relevant legislation and

155
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:18,860
三，任何人無合理辯解而沒有根據第二款出示其身份證明或表明其真確地址，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

156
00:23:46,760 --> 00:24:04,420
第五款，如任何人沒有根據第四款所提出的要求離開公眾休憩用地或其任何部分，獲授權人士可將該人士從該公眾休憩用地移走，需要時可使用合理武力。

157
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:20,980
如果冇咧，我哋第二二條。第二十二條，停靠於公眾休憩用地碼頭的船隻，一任何人未獲準許，不得把任何船隻，包括包船、水上的士或渡輪及遊樂船隻，停靠於連接或服務公眾休憩用。

158
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,120
噉，

159
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,980
八。

160
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,700
第六款，任何人無合理。

161
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,040
呢個移移走呢個動作，其實。

162
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,770
O.K.誒，各位同事有冇提問？對於第二十三條。

163
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,710
係咪應該等警察嚟做？如果係你哋去做，你哋嘅合理武力係會係點樣去理解咧？

164
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,900
There is a risk that that situation could actually escalate rather than be de-escalated, so we need to have these provisions.

165
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:56,050
Mr. Chairman, this is a practical issue. Of course, we would love if we could just call on the police to do these things for us, but reality is.

166
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:08,260
任何人無合理辯解而拒絕根據第七款隨同獲授權人士，或拒絕接受扣留，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第二級罰款。

167
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:21,480
辯解而沒有按根據第四款提出的要求離開公眾休憩用地或其任何部分，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，可處第一級罰款。

168
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:35,700
第七獲授權人士如合理地懷疑任何在公眾休憩用地內的人已干犯本附例所定的某罪行，該獲授權人士可A。

169
00:26:45,190 --> 00:27:00,890
them to discuss with them and that that does work in 99% of the time, but the 1% unfortunately, you do have people who are not controllable through reason and you need to be able to detain them. and in that case again, our staff will be trained.

170
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:53,680
要求該人隨同該獲授權人士前往管理局的辦事處、公園行政辦公室或警署，及B，在該人交予在該人被交予任何警務人員拘押以按照法律處理之前，扣留該人。

171
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:35,110
係，阿陳志柱。誒，我想問嘅係第五點嗰度，需要時可使用合理武力。嗯，獲授權人士應該就係西九管理局即係屬下或者保安公司嘅人，就唔係警察啦。咁因為呢個條文裏邊下邊會再有警務人員㗎嘛，噉。

172
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:39,880
如果冇提問咧，我哋進入第廿三條嚇。係跟住係第十步執行第二十三執行一，任何人不得妨礙、騷擾或幹擾獲授權人士或管理局的代理人或管理局的承包商履行或執行其與公眾休憩用地或。

173
00:22:43,450 --> 00:23:03,460
第二獲授權人士如合理地懷疑任何在公眾休憩用地內的人已違反本附例，該獲授權人士可在告知該人構成該懷疑為例事項的作為或不作為後，要求該人出示其身份證明及表。

174
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:39,150
四在以下情況下，獲授權人士可要求任何人離開公眾休憩用地或其任何部分：A.獲授權人士合理地懷疑該人已違反本附例，或B.該人沒有遵從任何獲授權人士跟。

175
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,710
O.K.

176
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,360
調翻轉。

177
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,930
the sequence of escalation, because on the spot, waiting ten minutes may be too late.

178
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:36,460
try to get them to understand why it's a problem. The third situation is if they refuse to to then.

179
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:13,030
Of course, as I said, this this is exactly why they will be trained, and the first instruction is.

180
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:02,500
佢要佢，因為佢有個責任喺警察嚟之前或者點樣，佢要去將嗰樣嗰個人移走，係會令件事升温而唔係降温咯。

181
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:06,910
and in those cases again, staff will be trained into what is considered to be appropriate force in different situations, and they'll be properly trained in that regard.

182
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:53,120
仲有冇提問？我想知即係到真係運作，你話呢個係實際嘅操作問題啦。你會點樣訓練佢？畀個指示佢去融合你武力。反而我覺得，如果你將個責任畀咗嗰個獲授權人士。

183
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:36,270
continue to be the case. Yes, I would agree with the honourable member. If I could have a policeman permanently stationed there, then the first thing would be to call the policeman. But I'm afraid, unfortunately, that's not likely to be the case. So authorised people need to have a certain amount of power.

184
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:29,070
don't deal with this on your own. Get someone else with you, so that you that there is adequate support for you. Second instruction is, if someone is creating a problem in the park, try and approach them and talk to them and explain the problem.

185
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:26,570
好O.K.啊，嗱，主席條例就係咁寫咧。但係我我同意你去到畀指令佢話請你離開啦。噉係即係如果但係如果佢唔合作嘅時候，你可能一般真實到發生嘅時候，你都可能會等警察嚟先至去做一啲移除。

186
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:16,440
On the spot, not likely to be a police officer, and our whole objective, the whole logic of our approach is to try and avoid having to use any force. What we want to try and do is persuade people. But if you don't have the ability to use reasonable force to remove someone from a situation,

187
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:45,190
from a purely practical point of view, I've said before that in having these provisions, our staff must be properly trained, and the the training is two parts. The first is in the measures that are appropriate to deescalate a situation. In other words, to calm people down, to reason with.

188
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:21,180
to use the absolute minimum force necessary to detain those people, and often, in our experience, the reason that these people need to be detained is for as much their own safety as the safety of people in the park or the open space, and that is the logic that we've applied already, and it's it will.

189
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,570
係。

190
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,160
yes.

191
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,090
即係比較寬鬆啲嘅。

192
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,230
啊，講嚟講去。

193
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,460
大家再冇提問對呢題。

194
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,060
嗯，OK，好，唔唔該曬，多謝。

195
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,860
We don't believe an interpretation is necessary.

196
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:58,540
要試，要

197
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:15,130
Let me stress, this is not what we regard as the norm. This is the exception. But in an exception, you have to have these provisions.

198
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:34,700
It's it's whatever people have on them that they can show the authorised person in those circumstances.

199
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:43,790
信啊！等佢哋，因為佢而家都未有依樣嘢嘅，咁亦都相信佢都係有能力去做到依樣嘢。除咗依個問題，仲有冇其他問題？

200
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:07,300
我會 expect them to call on assistance from other people within the park，所以有 sequence of escalation to to be able to deal with those situations。

201
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:27,040
It's not the same as having B. One of the immigration ordinance. This is a someone asks for a proof of identity. It could be a Hong Kong ID card. It could be a credit card. It could be a a bill from Hong Kong Electric.

202
00:31:46,630 --> 00:32:04,010
多謝主席。喺第二十三條嘅第二同埋第三款所提述嘅身份證明，誒係咪而家同入境條例第誒十七B一所講嘅誒含義係咪一樣咧？如果係即係誒睇下西九會唔會即係考慮就係加翻嗰個定義落去嘅嚇？唔該。

203
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:51,610
所以你你 say， this is a situation you may encounter， these are the circumstances， what do you do， and you you test them， so it's it's an iterative process， so you get people who explain。 the other thing of course is that， I would not expect one of my young park ambassadors

204
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:56,770
stop the behaviour or to comply with the request, then you would would would start to say, look, I must ask you to to be removed. So there's a sequence of escalation. It's not straight in to the use of force. The use of force is to be avoided, except where it becomes absolutely necessary.

205
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:46,860
即係移動嘅嘅行動，但係如果你話你嗰班誒獲授權人士佢都係要喺短時間內有呢個責任嘅時候，噉我就想知你畀佢嘅訓練係點樣，你嘅想像係點樣去將佢移走咯？如果你哋有冇一套嘅訓練方法？Mr. Chairman，I mean，we're getting

206
00:29:46,860 --> 00:30:06,870
Into a little bit of speculation, which I'm always hesitate to do. But I'll give you an example. Okay, you have someone who's drunk or on drugs, they are committing a problem. They're attacking young children in the park. You don't wait for a policeman. You deal with that problem. You have to. You can't let other people be affected by that situation. That's why we have to have.

207
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:33,740
simple fact， you've got to be able to deal with the problem as you see it。That's why we must train our staff to know about the different situations。The way you do that training is， of course， you have written rules， you have， you know， practice sessions， you have rehearsal sessions， so you actually place them in a situation and you test their response。

208
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:35,550
O.K.我諗依樣嘢，佢哋翻而家制定個法律啫。佢裏邊嗰個做法咧，噉我哋記低個會議記錄。希望佢哋有一啲好明確嗰啲訓練啊，或者指示，都喺唔同嘅環境底下作出任何嘅行動咧，好嘛？咁將來有機會嘅時候咧，就先至再查。

209
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,490
issues.

210
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,100
OK。

211
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,780
嗯。

212
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,870
Prosecutable action, and I would be.

213
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,740
The prosecution is undertaken under the bylaw. Of course, we deal with it.

214
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,180
好貴㗎，係啊！我知道啊，主席啲利益沖突啦，點啊？

215
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:52,270
如果冇咧，我哋就去到廿四條啦。嚇，第二十四條就罪行提出。

216
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,880
如果我們 invite the police to come in and deal with a criminal type action，then of course it's up to the Department of Justice.

217
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:10,990
O.K.係嘅。Of course, we don't need to. We will seek our own legal advice from our own legal advisers on these issues。咁呢個我都記得上一次誒都有。There be a lot of work for lawyers on this one。

218
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:49,500
方法去演譯法律，亦都係誒。我相信誒管理局亦都唔會話係動節就會係去提出檢控。呢個我相信係管理局嘅態度係咪？

219
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:25,200
But once you have bylaws, you do have to have some teeth, and it's the teeth are there to back up the bylaw. But so far, in eight nine months of operation in the the nursery park, we've not had to resort to any form of

220
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:28,210
係，誒楊楊議員，唔該主席。誒，想請問管理局咧，會喺乜嘢嘅情況底下會諮詢律政司嘅意見？喺邊一類型嘅情況咧，係管理局會自己處理咗個檢控？唔該。

221
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:59,800
所以我可唔可以理解為誒任何係喺今次條例裏邊所規範嘅行為，只要係跌咗入去條例所包含嘅，就管理局就會自己處理，而不會徵詢律政司意見。我噉樣理解有冇錯？

222
00:32:52,550 --> 00:33:11,490
就罪行提起法律程序時可用的名義，在不損害任何關乎刑事罪行的檢控的條例，法律政司司長就檢控刑事罪行的權力，根據本附例提出的檢控，可用管理局的名義提出。

223
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:38,480
嗱我唔係有啲平嘅，有啲cheap啲嘅，一間嚟嗰啲貴。誒，不過咧就誒都想特別提一提主席咧，就係誒對唔住，唔係提主席。咁緊要？誒特別想提翻局誒管理局咧，就誒我相信管理局應該都會係以一個相對寬鬆嘅方。

224
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,510
好，我哋散會。

225
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,360
誒，其實都係提一句，即係誒，我特別就關心，因為。

226
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:28,680
Absolutely, as I say, our whole objective, and I can state this quite happily here, is to avoid prosecution.

227
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,960
By every means, but we need to have that provision.好，唔該主席。之外，仲其他同事就冇提問呢點。

228
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:36,460
fairly confident in saying this will be a very rare occurrence. It's not something I would see every week, or every month, or maybe once a year.

229
00:37:50,200 --> 00:38:03,180
任何嘅意見的話咧，可能呢個會議就唔使開啦，好嘛？噉我哋就咁處理。如果唔反對的話，好喺度再次多謝大家嘅誒到嚟同埋提供咁寶貴嘅意見，多謝大家。

230
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:51,980
如果冇咧，我哋整個附例嘅審議已經完成咗啦，嚇！好多謝大家，好多謝大家嘅努力。咁咧就我哋審議嘅時候係用中文版本嘅，所以咧我哋請誒法律顧問咧都從我哋審議嘅。

231
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:28,210
就有關呢個誒，亦都希望你哋提交呢個附例嘅修正案嘅草誒嘅草稿，咁因為我哋都會拎上大會㗎啦，嚇，好嘛？咁呢度大家仲有冇其他事項、其他問題？

232
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:21,610
其他嘅方法係去處理，噉我亦都相信管理局都會願意係用嗰啲其他方法，即係例如即係交付法庭係以不提正供起訴，先保守行為。Only by no，我相信局方都都會有呢個態度啦，係嘛？

233
00:34:49,810 --> 00:35:09,820
In in fact, I did explain this at a previous meeting. Our whole appoint approach to this is to avoid getting into the courts. As you say, it is expensive. It's time consuming. By the time you get into the court, you know the event is months months away. So our our philosophy is is actually de escalation to avoid these.

234
00:35:43,730 --> 00:36:03,740
檢控工作係好冗長，亦都係相對複雜嘅。咁其實我就相信管理局未必會願意花資源喺嗰度。誒，尤其是亦都想提咧，就係如果有，因為如果係律政司處理咧，佢哋就有個正常嘅程序，係會同嗰啲誒潛在嘅被告人咧，係會用。

235
00:36:52,370 --> 00:37:12,380
角度咧，去睇睇英文版本嗰度點樣誒？修訂、修改有冇妥協？咁另外咧，我哋都即係多謝西九管理局同埋我哋法律顧問嘅同事出席啦。噉就住今日，如果有啲咩提問，或者如果有的話咧，就請你哋用書面咧回覆翻我哋，好嘛？咁咧。

236
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:50,200
如果冇咧，我哋下次咧都會有一次細會嘅，都要見誒，就係大概係三誒五月三十一號，今個月最後一日，就下晝四點四十五分。噉我哋翻嚟再最後睇睇有冇咩回應。如果誒嗰啲文本修改稿畀大家，大家都冇。
