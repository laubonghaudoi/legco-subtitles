1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,710
立法會主席。

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,790
主席，唔知前要求點算法定人數？

3
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,390
各位早晨，本會在繼續處理《二零一四年版權修訂條例草案》。

4
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,010
全體委員會審議階段，本會現在成為全體委員會。

5
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,510
全體委員會嘅辯論同埋表決嘅安排，請委員參閲講稿嘅附錄。

6
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:21,950
全體委員會係會先進行五項嘅辯論，第一及第二項辯論涉及陳鑑林議員作為。

7
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,210
條例草案委員會主席。

8
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,270
提出嘅修正案。

9
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:39,360
第三項辯論涉及商務及經濟發展局局長嘅修正案。第四項辯論涉及黃毓民議員嘅修正案。第五項辯論涉及冇修正案嘅條文。

10
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:53,670
五項辯論結束之後咧，全體委員會係會先表決納入冇修正案嘅條文，然後分別表決黃毓民議員、商務及經濟發展局局長同埋陳健林議員嘅修正案。

11
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,690
而且係會表決納入相關嘅條文。

12
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:20,750
第四、六、八、九、十三、十八、十九、二十一至二十七、三十至三十五、三十七、四十一、四十二、四十三、四十七、四十八、五十、五十二、七十五、七十六、七十八至八十一。

13
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,180
八十三、八十四、八十六至八十九條。

14
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:45,020
全體委員會現在進行第一項嘅辯論。陳嘉明議員已經作出預告，動議講稿附錄所在嘅佢嘅第一組嘅修正案，修正第十八、十九、二十四、七十五、七十六以及第七十八條。

15
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:53,670
修正案咧係旨在就版權豁免加入限制合約凌駕性嘅條文。

16
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:00,140
委員咧可以就第十八、十九、二十四、七十五及七十八條嘅相關部分。

17
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:10,410
第七十六條嘅原條文，以及陳淦霖議員嘅修正案進行合並辯論。陳淦霖議員，你仲可以動議你嘅第一組修正案。

18
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,800
主席。

19
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:23,370
我動議講稿附錄所在嘅我第一組嘅修正案，以修正第十八、十九、二十四、七十五同埋七十八條。

20
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,720
就版權豁免加入限制合約凌駕性嘅條文。

21
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:37,080
昨日陳志全議員提到有三條嘅誒，有三項由我提出嘅修正案咧，係得到法案委員會支持嘅問題。

22
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,060
事實並非如此。

23
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:59,350
我要澄清嘅係有關嘅修正建議，雖然間喺審議嘅期間，不同嘅議員都不斷有提出討論。然而，政府官員及部分嘅議員亦有提出不同嘅意見，只係三位議員喺最後提出咧，要求本人作為法案委員會嘅新主席。

24
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:08,680
身份代為提出修訂，因此不表示三項修正案係整體法案委員會共識下獲得支持嘅。

25
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,080
本人今日提出修訂，不表示本人會支持有關嘅修訂。

26
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,720
以下係本人對有關修正案嘅睇法。

27
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:30,530
香港嘅版權法提供咗豁免，容許使用者為某啲目的，例如教學、研究、評論等。

28
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,290
而公平處理版權作品。

29
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:44,350
不會擔心咧係侵犯版權，但係與此同時，版權擁有人仍然可以利用合約嘅方式。

30
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:52,030
同作品嘅使用者訂立合約，限制呢啲法定嘅版權豁免嘅實施。

31
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,010
呢個就係所謂合約凌駕性。

32
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,240
我哋而家討論嘅修訂案咧，其目的就係要限制呢一種合約嘅凌駕性。

33
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:12,260
具體而言，就係如果有合約條款嘅作用，係限制使用者喺法定版權豁免之下可以做嘅行為。

34
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,030
呢啲條文咧就會無效。

35
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:34,180
郭榮亨議員喺審議初期就提出呢一方面嘅關注，認為既然間立法豁免版權作品嘅使用，就唔應該讓私人合約超越法例，相對嘅剝奪咗法例嘅效力，故此咧係提出限制合約嘅凌駕性。

36
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:48,620
簡單而言咧，呢一個修正案嘅效果係不允許有任何合約，使得法例嘅豁免係被取消，喺一定程度上限制立約嘅自由。

37
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:58,900
但係喺現實嘅社會裏邊，特別係一個商業社會裏邊咧，合約自由係我哋呢個社會運作嘅基本原則。

38
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:14,930
當然呢一個原則唔係神聖不可侵犯嘅，喺公共利益嘅考慮底下，尤其係考慮到某一啲社會羣體嘅議價地位，我哋係可以通過立法去限制立約嘅自由。

39
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:27,440
更好噉樣咧，去保障呢一啲羣體嘅利益，例如不公平嘅大廈公契嘅條款，或者係不公平嘅消費者嘅條約。

40
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:39,570
即使係定立之後，亦都唔會有效力嘅。然而，要限制私下立約嘅自由咧，我哋就必須要係基於實際嘅。

41
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:54,090
理由只有當出現問題，而且咧係唔能夠通過自由市場嘅運作以及自由立約嘅方式去解決嘅話，我哋先至應該作出干預嘅。

42
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:02,470
我哋現在面對嘅實際情況係咩咧？就係版權條例一直都有提供唔同類型嘅版權豁免。

43
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:22,760
而呢啲豁免咧，亦都係一直運作得非常良好，並冇出現版權人不合理嘅利用合約嘅方式去排除版權豁免嘅問題。現階段我哋睇唔到有需要咧，係去立法幹預市場嘅運作，完全禁止版權人同埋使用。

44
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,400
者自行訂立雙方接受嘅安排。

45
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,710
我哋反而見到嘅就係，如果立法幹預嘅話，

46
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,290
只會製造新嘅問題。

47
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,730
舉一個例子。

48
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:57,520
喺容許合約凌駕性嘅情況底下，一名小説嘅原作者可以同電影改編者立訂立協議，不容許戲房之內嘅改編演繹。呢個係合情合理嘅做法。如果我哋冒然立法規定呢一種嘅協議無效，

49
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:16,930
咁會唔會出現咧？係改變咗原作者嘅原創作嘅嗰種精髓，歪曲咗原創者嘅創作原意。另外，亦都會擾亂咗原作者同埋改編者之間嘅正常商業合作嘅信心咧。

50
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:32,090
另外，我哋亦都要睇下，如果教學機構與版權人訂立合約嘅安排清晰噉樣去劃界，講明乜嘢可以做，乜嘢唔可以做，噉就可以減少呢？

51
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,490
爭議同埋訴訟嘅風險，其實對雙方都係有利嘅。

52
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:48,430
版權法可以講係十分複雜嘅一條法例，包括點樣先至構成公平處理係唔容易界定嘅。

53
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,800
麥克吐温曾經講過，佢話世界上有一件事上帝都搞唔清嘅。

54
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,880
就係理解地球上任何嘅一條版權法例。

55
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:21,220
其實現時咧，有不同嘅國家都有不同嘅版權法例。既然間係噉樣嘅話，版權人與用家用合約嘅方式去清晰噉樣劃定彼此之間嘅權責界線，係可以減少爭議，尊重創作。

56
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,580
增強互信。

57
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,240
呢個係有實際嘅需要嘅，我哋唔應該冒然咧就限制呢啲嘅合約安排。

58
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:47,060
香港一直話要發展成為知識產權嘅貿易中心，但如果限制合約嘅零價性，一啲嘅版權作品同埋授權嘅合約就可能唔會喺香港籤立，亦都不會以香港為法律管轄地。

59
00:20:47,410 --> 00:21:01,410
英國喺二零一四年立法限制合約凌駕性嘅時候，佢哋嘅上議院曾經有過激烈嘅辯論。呢個問題咧，亦都係一個非常之重要嘅關注點。

60
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,460
有議員就擔心，如果英國唔容許合約零價性。

61
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:16,240
提供內容嘅公司可能就會選擇到其他可讓他們自由商議合約嘅司法管轄區去訂立合約。

62
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,440
影響英國嘅競爭力。

63
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:31,540
因此，我哋都要小心評估，到底立法限制合約嘅凌駕性係咪會影響到香港嘅競爭力，影響到香港發展知識產權嘅貿易？

64
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:42,430
亦都有人擔心，針對新增嘅戲仿版權豁免，版權人可能會比以往更加傾向利用合約作出限制。

65
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:53,330
呢個當然係其中一個可能性，但係我哋都要睇到合約只能係限制立約嘅雙方，不能夠限制第三者。

66
00:21:53,610 --> 00:22:13,620
版權人想利用合約廣泛地限制一般用户享受版權豁免嘅權利係唔容易嘅。有人擔心版權人會會同大型嘅網絡平台簽訂零價版權豁免嘅條款，從而咧限制呢啲網絡平台嘅用户。

67
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:31,790
嗱呢一種嘅憂慮係忽略咗大型網絡平台本身嘅倚架地位，佢哋只會按自己嘅商業策略去考慮容許用户發布乜嘢嘅內容。如果佢哋唔想用户發布某一啲嘅內容，

68
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:43,210
佢哋完全係可以按自己嘅意願咧，係去移除呢啲內容嘅。就算有限制合約靈活性嘅立法，亦都唔能夠阻止佢哋噉樣做。

69
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,260
另外啊，根據香港嘅普通法同埋成文法。

70
00:22:48,540 --> 00:23:07,890
包括不合情理嘅合約條款咧，一啲不公平或者係違反公共政策嘅合約條款，亦都未必能夠獲得法庭嘅認可得以執行嘅。因此，版權人想限制版權豁免嘅實施並不容易。

71
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:23,100
退一步嚟講，假設將來不合理地利用合約去限制某一類嘅版權豁免嘅情況，真係變成一個問題嘅時候，到時我哋再考慮點樣去立法去禁止，亦都唔遲嘅。

72
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,310
有人話：沒有限制合約靈駕性嘅規定，就好容易令人咧。

73
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,650
係墮入版權嘅法網，嗱呢個講法並不全面。

74
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:56,030
必須要指出，如果雙方訂立一個有零價版權豁免條款嘅合約，而用家一方面咧又唔遵守呢一個條款，其實佢係冇侵犯版權，更不會構成咧係刑事嘅罪行。佢個問題只係違約而已。

75
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:07,550
如果一個人自願訂立合約，清楚自己嘅責任，佢因為違約而被另外一方面去追究嘅話，咁又有乜嘢不合理咧？

76
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:16,820
對目前呢一個修正案，我認為佢仲有一個實際嘅問題，就係按字面嘅理解，呢個修正似乎係有追索力嘅。

77
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,340
即係話現有嘅合約同商業嘅安排都適用嘅。

78
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:42,630
換言之，一啲而家已經係合法有效嘅合約條款，都可能會變成無效。修訂嘅實際效果係咪噉樣咧？如果係嘅話，對訂立呢啲合約嘅各方面又係唔係公平咧？我希望支持呢一個修訂案嘅同事一定要好。

79
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,100
小心噉樣去考慮。

80
00:24:44,530 --> 00:25:04,540
限制合約零價性係一個好新嘅概念，喺英國亦都只係喺二零一四年先至制制定嘅，而且其過程都係充滿爭議。英國政府亦都同意要喺未來嘅五年裏邊咧，去評估新法實施嘅影響。

81
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:24,730
澳洲當局亦都曾經詳細嘅研究有關嘅問題，但係並冇立法。我哋認為香港喺呢個問題上面應該採取一個審慎嘅態度，要小心研究英國嘅實踐嘅經驗，並且詳細諮詢各方持份者嘅意見，先至好作出。

82
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:44,740
決定，鑑於特區政府已經表明會喺未來一段時間裏邊咧，係就住版權法檢討中去處理呢個問題，我哋認為現階段係不適宜支持限制合約凌駕性嘅立法嘅，因此本人同埋民建聯係反對有關嘅修訂案嘅。多謝。

83
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,170
地主席。有雞腸魚。

84
00:25:48,650 --> 00:26:08,660
謝謝，主席。Speaking to support the committee stage amendment proposed by the honourable Dennis Quirk, which was tabled just in the chamber by the honourable Chan Kam Nam, the chairman of the Bills Committee. In fact, what Mr Chan has already told us, in fact, were the

85
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,530
但係，real reasons for the acceptance of the contract override provision。

86
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:21,730
Now, let me explain a simple scenario under which copyright commercial contracts will arise.

87
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:31,630
Now, Mr. President, I would like to make use of the music industry again to illustrate how contract override will.

88
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,150
rectify absurdity in contractual situations.

89
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,170
Now，suppose，I，am，a，music，composer.，I，have，composed，a，song，and，lyrics.

90
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:52,170
The first contract in relation to copyright is that I will sell my contractual rights, my copyright, to a music publisher. Is really

91
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,530
一 piece of music plus the lyrics.

92
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:06,860
The music publisher is a corporation with huge financial resources and muscle, like you know RCA, Polygram or these big companies.

93
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:18,250
And what the music publisher will do is that they will engage a singer, engage a band to do the recording, and then after which.

94
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,650
They will.

95
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,290
first of all， trying to sell CDs。

96
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,600
now。

97
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,630
In fact, each of the CD is an implied license.

98
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,070
what is implied in this license to the consumer is that

99
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:50,060
Each of the purchaser of the CD will have a licence to listen to the music produced by the music publisher. Okay, that is what it is said in the licence when you get a CD.

100
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,890
Now, a very absurd situation will arise. For example.

101
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:15,060
我有個CD喺家，我播喺我HiFi，，和後來我諗，係一個好嘅主意。例如，如果我想要做一個CD嘅複製，然後播喺我嘅車度，當我開車去上班時，主席，呢個係啲人經常做嘅，即係聽佢哋嘅愛好音樂，當佢哋開車去上班。

102
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:21,430
OK， I make a copy of my CD by whatever means， and play it in my car。

103
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:33,060
Now, of course, under the present copyright ordinance, there is such an exemption because I make my own copy, I put it on another machine and I play it.

104
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,170
However, for some special reason, I'm.

105
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,800
If the music publisher thinks that, I think.

106
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,700
We could do better. We could have a bigger market. We could have a bigger sale if we.

107
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,680
forbid people to make private copies of their CDs.

108
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,560
unless they are paying extra.

109
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,480
And if this is what it is excluded in such a contract.

110
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,510
我認為，這會造成一啲情況。

111
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,750
Now, if we allow people to do this without the contract override provision,

112
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:29,620
那會 mean that no people even if they buy the CD, they won't be able to play it in the car or make a copy and play in the car. Now, the reason why in England in 2014 they make such a amendment after very lengthy consultation, is that

113
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,100
The music publisher.

114
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,430
The consumers.

115
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:48,090
and also the creator of music, they are in different bargaining position. It is just exactly what Mr. Chan just said in speech, because they are in different bargaining position.

116
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,080
The corporation has a lot of resources.

117
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,470
financial powers or otherwise， and consumers.

118
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:05,490
cannot negotiate a contract at all. If they buy the CD with that implied license, saying that oh they can make a copy, they have to accept that.

119
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,300
similar situation arises, Mr. President.

120
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,850
And I can draw an analogy from the Employment Ordinance, Chapter Fifty Seven of the Laws of Hong Kong.

121
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,630
section seven seventy。

122
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,330
of the employment contract said.

123
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:40,340
任何條文或僱傭契約，其目的為 extinguish 或減少任何權利、利益或保護，賦予僱員的，由本法令，將被宣告無效。無效意味著不可執行的契約。

124
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:47,440
now this contracting out provision or prohibition against contracting out provision.

125
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:56,060
was inserted into the employment ordinance in June 1997. Now, why should we need this contracting out provision?

126
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,730
The real reason is that.

127
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,400
The employer.

128
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:09,250
and employee are both in an unequal bargaining position. They are not equal partners in a negotiation.

129
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,210
If I tell you this is the employment contract, Mr. A.

130
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,100
Take it or leave it.

131
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,180
and if such employment contract contains terms which violates.

132
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,390
The employment ordinance saying that okay, I'm going to pay you severance. I'm not going to pay you.

133
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,300
all kinds of benefits.

134
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,800
what do you think now if an employee is in a dire position?

135
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:41,460
要得job，他會有 no 其他 choice 但要 take the contract。

136
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:53,410
所以，section 70 of the employment ordinance is to protect employee because the employee is in a less, much less favourable bargaining position.

137
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,510
similarly， in this CSA。

138
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,460
The prohibition against contract override is to protect.

139
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,860
people who are in a much less favourable bargaining position.

140
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:26,690
Mr. President, the example I have set out, first of all, it is the music creator, the sole proprietor who writes music, who creates the lyrics. He is a sole proprietor. Most in most circumstances, he sells the right to the music publisher.

141
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,180
and secondly.

142
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,840
那係啲音樂出版商。

143
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:42,230
who sells different types of licences to different types of people. For example, I'm a consumer. I buy a CD. I get a licence to play on my mum machine.

144
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:52,100
And then also, if there is a radio station, there is a music programme. If the DJ plays that piece of music, of course.

145
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:06,190
他 has to pay a license fee to the music publisher, or public broadcasting would need a license if the radio station or the public broadcaster plays a piece of music.

146
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,660
Now, how about if a contract says, okay?

147
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,780
你可以 just play my music，但，如果你 ever try to criticise my music，

148
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:23,510
That is illegal. That is outside my contract. I'm not going to give you a licence to criticise my music. You just play it.

149
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:33,590
How about that? Is this a contracting out? If the most popular to say, I don't want anyone in this world to criticise this piece of music. This is the best in the world.

150
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:42,410
This is of course against the exemption granted by the copyright amendment ordinance of the bill.

151
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:59,700
But if that is such kind of contract, it is quite absurd, because naturally, when the DJ plays the music, he will say okay, because he will just criticise or review the type of music played, the quality of singing and recording, etc.

152
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,070
now of course there may be some problems.

153
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:22,170
When enforcing the contract override provision, and I think, Mr. President, I will take my next opportunity to tackle each of these problems you know encountered by the UK experience.

154
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:34,490
Now, one of the thing I need to talk about is a concept about freedom to contract. Now, of course, in a commercial world, everyone is free to contract.

155
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:47,530
You can buy and sell goods. You can buy and sell services. But there are two main exceptions to freedom to contract. In fact, the contractual terms are not that free.

156
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,900
Now there are ample amount of literature, Mr. President, which tells us that.

157
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:59,240
兩個 contracting party are not free to negotiate whatever they want in their contract.

158
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:12,600
我可以舉一個極端的例子。如果我問你，我給你一個合同，要殺某人，是那條法律合同？那條合同可執行嗎？它完全不是。

159
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,900
Now, of course, illegality of contract comes in two very distinct situations.

160
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,420
First, it is illegality against public policy.

161
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,780
如果的合法性的合同 falls into this category.

162
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:37,340
Then it will be up to the court to decide what is, and what is not against public policy.

163
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,660
The second type of illegality arises is that it is statutory illegal.

164
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,020
now of course。

165
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:59,550
My honourable friends on the opponent's side would say, oh, all these contract override prohibition would create a lot of uncertainty. But we are not talking about the first category of.

166
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,210
illegality illegality because of

167
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,360
doing something against public policy.

168
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,850
If we have a provision, a very clear, consistent provision in a statute which says.

169
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:25,630
或合同，which contains contractual terms which reduce the protection or anything.

170
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,440
stipulated by the ordinance is unenforceable and void.

171
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:40,950
那係一個非常清晰、簡明及一致的詞彙，可以告訴受約方忘記。

172
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:49,910
whatever is said in the law, you cannot override. Whatever is said in the law, it is clear.

173
00:36:50,270 --> 00:37:00,860
We have gone through hundreds of hours of debate. The UK Parliament has gone through hundreds of hours of debate in order to arise at the contract override provision.

174
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,600
The honourable Mr Chan has just quoted.

175
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,470
The debate about counter override, when it took place in 2014.

176
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,410
造成一個 disturbance，只在議會。

177
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,780
我認為，在下議院。

178
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,980
There was a consensus.

179
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:28,980
因為，每當英國政府提出一項立法，他們會經過兩個非常 thorough 的過程。一

180
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,990
是一 study，一 thorough study。

181
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,530
and all.

182
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:42,290
Legislations in relation to intellectual property law in the UK has gone through very thorough studies.

183
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:54,430
and in fact it is on the evidence based that they will publish the first consultation paper, and there are maybe one or two rounds of consultations.

184
00:37:54,850 --> 00:38:03,920
所以，我唔認為英國條文2014係一個草率處理商業合約的方式。

185
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:15,010
Now, as I have said, there are issues in relation to the enforcement of the contract override provision, and I've got a few of them.

186
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,330
但這些條款。

187
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,930
唔係，那，佢哋唔可以解決，佢哋可以解決，但係要睇下。

188
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,040
and since we are now talking about technology, talking about innovation.

189
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:41,440
Why can't we embrace something advanced, something innovative, something which can provide more certainty and not uncertainty to the contracts?

190
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,510
Now，in fact，when you look at this。

191
00:38:46,580 --> 00:39:06,590
The problem created by the enforcement or the letters of the law, we can do something to it. Of course, the government can issue interpretation notes or enforcement notice of how the particular section now could be enforced. This is doable.

192
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:16,130
And in fact, in my next speech, I will try to explain in more clear and succinct terms how each of these situations can be remedied.

193
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:29,930
主席，我認為我會留給下一次演講處理所有具體情況，因為這是一個相當長的長列表，我需要處理的事情。謝謝主席。

194
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,270
我永亨業。

195
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,540
多謝主席。

196
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,850
主席，其實。

197
00:39:43,590 --> 00:40:03,600
版權法咧，即係本身係一個幾複雜嘅法律概念嚟嘅。佢亦都係間接啊，或者直接嘅，係會啊影響到一個個別人士或者組織嘅私有利益，特別係喺金錢上嘅利益咧，係會有個好大嘅影響。更

198
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:17,840
更加係會間接噉樣咧，係影響好大部分人嘅公共利益嘅，所以市民咧對於版權法嘅修訂同埋誒定立咧，有一個強烈嘅誒。

199
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:38,350
感受或者係對於有一個誒誒某一個條文係比較敏感咧，呢個係絕對正常。而且平心而論，主席而家我哋喺度審議嘅條例草案咧，比喺二零一一年時候政府提出嘅版本咧，以及係比現行嘅誒版權條例咧，係。

200
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:47,760
係有一個明顯嘅改善，對於好大部分嘅市民嚟講咧，或者網民啦嚇嘅保障，亦都係增加咗唔少嘅。

201
00:40:48,040 --> 00:41:05,580
專門辦理版權法案案件嘅大律師公會主席譚允之資深大律師啦，同埋喺古惑天案案當當中咧，代表被告嘅潘國雄大律師啦，已喺傳媒訪問中表達咗一啲嘅佢哋嘅睇法。

202
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,560
啊！條例草案引入嘅公平處理原則咧。

203
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:20,260
係對於誒一啲啊時事評論啊、誒戲仿啊、諷刺啊、營造滑稽模仿目的嘅作品咧，係有。

204
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:40,660
在非用作誒一個誒討論嘅時候咧，係有一個誒實質嘅作用喺度咧，係令到有一啲誒誒喺非誒商業或者牟利嘅用途嘅情況下咧，係提供咗有啲誒有用嘅闊面，係唔不是誒不是作為。

205
00:41:40,660 --> 00:42:00,670
一個版權侵犯嘅行為咧，係免去刑事同埋民事責任。不過，儘管如此都好啦，嚇條例草案對於網民嘅保障其實係未夠周全嘅，因為喺一個法治嘅社會裏邊，除咗法律之外咧，仲有各種各項各樣嘅一啲誒合約或者。

206
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:20,680
契約係會規限一個人嘅權利同埋自由嘅，最明顯嘅例子咧就係僱傭合約啦。大家都知道啦，嗱，每一個打工仔都要照住合約咧，係翻工、放工或者係根據佢嗰個僱主畀佢嘅指示，係做一啲特定嘅工作。喺呢一方面。

207
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,790
其實條例草案係一個好大嘅漏洞。

208
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,040
咁漏洞係乜咧？就係。

209
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,380
喺一個冇定私人合約。

210
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,420
不能限制條例草案嘅豁免嘅作品同埋行為咧。

211
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:47,560
變相係畀版權人咧，或者客第三者咧，譬如説一啲社交網站啊、Facebook啊、Twitter等等咧，可以喺嗰個用户合約裏邊咧。

212
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,050
加啲條款。

213
00:42:49,520 --> 00:43:04,670
嗰啲條款會講咩咧？就係佢話限制咗一個用家或者一個網民咧，做以上等等咁多種嘢。本來嗰個網民或者個市民咧，其實佢係可以用到法例上嗰個嘅豁免。

214
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:17,270
就係話啊，我做戲仿，我做誒諷刺嘅二次創作，或者咧係用嚟做研究等等咧，其實佢係可以啊有個闊面嘅。不過，

215
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:37,790
私人嘅啊一啲啊網上平台或者誒好似一啲版權擁有人，佢哋喺同啊網民或者啊一啲購買佢嘅商品嘅人咧，佢喺可以喺個合約嘅條款裏邊咧講明就係話你唔唔能夠用香港。

216
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:57,800
法例賦予畀你嘅一個本身，你應該有嘅一個豁免嘅權利。所以咧，呢個作品咧，你係唔可以做戲仿，唔可以做誒誒呢一個誒諷刺等等嘅一啲二次創作。咁但係，我會話：咦，法例其實畀咗依一個豁免我嘅。不過，

217
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:17,810
佢會同你講就係合約上邊咧，我係可以再加啲條款去約制你，唔畀你用喺法律上邊你本身有嘅一個豁免權。呢一個咧就係正正就係產生咗一個不確定嘅因素啦。嗱，我哋同啲版權擁有人去討論嘅時候，我都會好直接問。

218
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,310
佢。

219
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:38,600
其實你點解咁擔心我提出呢一個合約凌駕性嘅修訂咧？其實你會點用咧？嗰啲版權擁有人就同我講話誒，其實我哋都未諗到真係會點用。不過我哋一定要保留呢個權利，因為我哋可能第時真係要喺合約嗰度加啲條款咧，係啊去。

220
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,140
去保護我哋。

221
00:44:40,420 --> 00:45:00,430
嘅權益就可能咧，真係要係啊，限制一啲用户佢哋嗰個嘅啊喺法律上邊本身有嘅權利，就唔畀佢哋做戲房，或者唔畀佢哋去做一啲根本上喺法例上已經豁免咗佢哋嘅一啲行為。咁嗱，噉我就反問啦。咁如果係。

222
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:20,440
噉樣嘅話，我就更加一定要堅持我嗰個合約凌駕性嘅嘅修訂啦。點解咧？就係因為你同我講話，你真係會咁用啊嘛？你真係會係用合約嘅條款咧，係去啊限制咗一啲啊普通人或者網民佢哋本身有嘅權利。咁其實我哋而家。

223
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,190
立依條法例已經係啊，政府同埋我哋咧已經係作咗一個初步嘅公共政策。

224
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:47,480
嘅一個睇法，或者已經畫咗條線，就話咧呢啲噉樣嘅二次創作、呢啲噉樣嘅誒戲仿等等嘅作品咧，其實係應該唔受到任何版權法嘅限制。所以我哋先有呢個豁免啊嘛。但係如果唔係嘅，調翻轉我哋作咗呢一個公共政策嘅取向之後，畫咗喺法例上。

225
00:45:47,480 --> 00:46:07,490
上面畫咗一條線哦，原來唔係嘅。原來嗰啲私人嘅誒誒呢個版權擁有人，或者甚至有啲網絡嘅平台咧，係可以作出一啲噉樣嘅私人合約嘅條款去限制翻嗰個用户嘅自由嘅話，咁咪好似完全係等於冇立法噉樣，或者立咗法。

226
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:27,500
就等於係啊啊，其實冇冇冇資格去實際上去享有嗰個嘅發表權嘅話咧，其實呢一個係大大削弱咗我哋今次嗰個誒法例本身嘅原意嘅。咁所以即係大家要睇清楚嘅就係私人合約其實係一個好大嘅。

227
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:37,030
權力去限制嗰個發言，或者限制嗰個自由言論嗰個基礎。點解我哋要有氣房豁免諷刺呢啲等等嘅啊？

228
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:57,500
啊豁免權咧，就係要希望喺呢一方面可以確保啊市民大眾喺呢一方面嗰個言論自由啊嘛。如果有人可以用私人嘅合約條款去反而去限制咗呢個言論自由，噉我哋嗰個法律嗰個啊基礎或者嗰個一貫性咧，係會大大受到影響嘅喺二。

229
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:17,510
以下落嚟嗰個誒辯論咧，我會係講翻點解嗰時喺英國上訴誒誒唔係上訴法院，但係喺呢一個誒誒House of Lords即係誒上議院嗰度咧，其實咧係誒有個好充分嘅辯論，就係點解有啲人就反對有呢個合約凌駕性咧，就係因為佢哋話合約自由。

230
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:37,520
係好重要。有啲人咧就話誒誒，唔係嘅誒，應該好似頭先我所講，應該咧喺依一方面嗰個闊面咧係有一致性嘅，即係無論我用Facebook、我用Twitter或者用其他社交網站都好，佢唔可以用嗰個誒用者條款裏邊或者喺私人合約條款裏邊咧限制咗我去。

231
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:57,530
用呢啲噉樣嘅喺法律賦予咗畀我嘅一啲豁免嘅權利。咁所以即係大家睇到其實嗰個嗰個誒，而家有噉嘅需要，尤其是喺香港一個比較細嘅，雖然有一個國際社會，但係誒，相對嚟講比起一個國家係比較細嘅一個商業社會，Facebook、Twitter咧，可能係佔咗。

232
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:17,540
誒，用户或者佔咗而家互聯網上邊嗰個誒九十個percent以上嘅一個誒誒用户嘅嘅需求。咁其實佢哋如果喺嗰個條款用者條款裏面加一啲合約嘅嘅原則或者條款咧，係唔畀你去用嗰個嘅誒括。

233
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:27,240
免權咧，其實會係大大影響咗誒嗰個言論自由，同埋而家法例誒本身賦予畀網民嗰個嘅。

234
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:47,710
自由噉，頭先我都講過啦，即係Facebook嗰個使用條款咧，係其中一個真係可以係令到網民係唔能夠刊登或者傳播一啲以評論時事、戲仿、諷刺、營造滑稽同埋模仿目的嘅作品，噉就等於禁止禁止咗好多網民咧，或者是。

235
00:48:47,710 --> 00:49:07,720
市民咧喺Facebook上邊咧，係作出呢啲噉樣嘅行為噉樣嘅私人合約咧。如果係凌駕咗嗰個誒版權法、凌駕咗個法律嘅話咧，係會甚至即係誒會令到嗰個私人合約咧，其實係有一個可以喺誒而家版權法就算如果通過咗之後咧，係一個特別。

236
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:27,730
嘅一個性質嘅主席，我喺法案委員會嗰陣時咧，就已經提出咗呢個漏洞，亦都同官員咧係有三番四次嘅好多辯論啊，或者係同版權擁有人咧，亦都有來來往往傾過好多次。究竟咧就係即係保障呢一個誒合約自由中？

237
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:47,740
要啊，抑或保障啊市民嗰個嘅誒誒誒言論自由啊喺網上自由重要咧，即係我就認為肯定係後者更加重要嘅，尤其是喺依一個誒誒世代咧，我哋係講緊即係誒互聯網嗰種重要性，我哋要。

238
00:49:47,740 --> 00:50:07,750
係啊！啟發嗰個創作啊，啟發誒網民或者誒市民咧，佢哋有更多嘅空間咧。其實呢一個係國際大方向嘅，所以點解我覺得英國嗰個發展咧係正確嘅，就係應該佢係鼓勵啲人咧係可以喺網絡上邊有一個更大嘅自由，唔會受到一個私人。

239
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,200
契約嘅誒。

240
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:29,670
誒一個嘅限制，當然啦。講翻轉頭，我其實係尊重呢一個合約自由嘅重要性嘅，因為咧，其實佢當然合合約係要嚟保障雙方喺簽合約嘅時候咧有一個充分嘅自主性。嗱，呢一個基本嘅原則咧，我完全係誒同意㗎。不過，

241
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:49,680
正如所有嘅自由咧，都唔係絕對嘅啦。呢一樣嘢建制派係好中意成日講嘅，就話自由唔係絕對嘅，都有誒都有限制嘅。咁呢個係啱嘅，冇錯嘅，同意嘅。正如你唔可以喺一個啊戲院嗰度大聲嗌有火燭噉樣，呢一個呢啲唔係你嘅言論自由。

242
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,140
因為呢個會向誒對其他人構成危險嘅。

243
00:50:53,420 --> 00:51:13,430
咁當然定合約嘅時候咧，自由咧呢一樣嘢，合約自由咧，其實都應該受到限制。根據補通法嘅原則咧，任何私人嘅合約咧都唔能夠凌駕或者違反法律嘅。用翻僱用合約呢個做例子啊，如果有一份合約寫明一個工人係必須做足七日。

244
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,410
冇休息，又冇薪水嘅。

245
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:29,820
咁呢一個合約咧，其實好明顯都已經係違反咗合約誒僱用條例，所以咧係會自動失效嘅。局長本身都係律師，對於呢個法律原則咧，應該亦都係非常之熟悉，所以咧喺任誒。

246
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:50,260
點可以話係誒？有人可以訂立合約喺合約裏邊咧，講明話呢啲噉樣嘅本來豁免咗嘅零價合約條款咧，就係無效啦嗱。其實即係本身嗰個法律概念，如果噉樣講完之後咧，其實我希望即係大家或者係誒，如果有市民聽緊嘅話咧，其實都應該睇到。

247
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,520
當中嗰個啊啊！

248
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:12,810
當中嗰個誒矛盾係喺邊度？究竟我哋係要畀大家一個完全絕對冇限制嘅合約自由啊，亦或我哋喺合約自由嗰度定一啲限制，就係唔可以畀佢加入條款咧，係會令到呢啲豁免嘅誒，本來已經有豁免嘅條款咧，係變咗無效。

249
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:16,460
變咗畀唔到一個誒法律保障一啲市民。

250
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:26,180
當然，政府當局咧就會講啊，既然呢啲合約條款係唔能夠啊凌駕法律嘅話，其實已經係補通法嘅本身一個原則啦。咁

251
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:37,480
即使版權條例冇寫明嘅話，對於網民嚟講，其實已經有同樣嘅保障，所以係無需接納我修正案。嗱，呢一個論點咧必須要講清楚嘅，就係佢話。

252
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:57,840
其實而家我哋法例如果通過咗嘅話，已經有依個豁免，已經係畀咗網民或者市民一個噉樣嘅誒氣房嘅豁免咁先講啦。根據普通法嘅原則（common law）嘅原則咧，其實你喺合約裏邊咧，就算你寫明話我而家要限制你呢一個啊啊～

253
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:17,850
呢一個自由，我要限制你呢個誒使用呢個闊面嘅權利。其實喺普通法上邊咧，其實都誒誒呢一個條款可能都係冇效力㗎啦。嗱，可能係冇效力，可能係有，可能要打官司，可能市民會喺度去諗究竟以Facebook上邊咁寫個。

254
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:37,860
user term個用用用誒嗰個用家原則係咁寫規則，噉我係咪以身試法？我係咪試一試搏一搏睇佢告唔告我誒違約啦？咁嗱，即係呢一個好多市民嚟講咧，都係唔會以身犯險嘅，因為你噉樣咧，其實其實咧，即係係叫人去試下挑。

255
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:57,870
挑戰Facebook，叫人試下去毀約，跟住睇下人哋會唔會告你？咁咧，即係對一般嘅市民嚟講，或者對一般嘅網民嚟講咧，呢一個係好大嘅風險。大家都知道香港打官司係非常之昂貴嘅，咁誒法援咧亦都係嗰個誒基礎係好差嘅。咁如果冒冒然叫啲人去違，

256
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:05,200
玩一個合約嘅話咧，係誒，其實一個好大嘅嘅風險。咁所以，我提出呢個修正案咧，主席。

257
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:11,160
主要係希望保障，令市民得到一個安心，就係就算。

258
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:31,990
面書Facebook佢真係要擺一啲噉樣嘅條款裏邊去限制一個人嗰個自由、網絡自由嘅話咧，都好啦嚇。其實市民都會知道，其實呢啲條款咧，香港嘅法律裏邊咧係唔適用嘅，係唔會有效嘅。咁咧呢個係其中一個例子。噉我之後嘅發言咧，亦都會去講其他嗰。

259
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:35,060
個誒呢個合約凌駕性嘅重要性，多謝主席。

260
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,130
馬逢國議員。

261
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,720
誒，長者有冇咩問題？

262
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,960
我發覺咧就誒今朝早幾位發言嘅議員咧，就都有偏離咧我哋議事規則五十六一。

263
00:54:49,280 --> 00:55:01,910
五十六一，因為講到好清楚，係只能夠討論呢條法案嘅細節，不能討論其原則，所以請啊主席。

264
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,160
我認為發言嗰個議員咧都係冇違反議事規則嘅，馬逢國議員，請你發言。

265
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:30,050
主席，The contract override provisions in the proposed exceptions are a new and untried concept in UK copyright law, and the provisions were subject to heavy criticism during the legislative process as being formulated too hastily without going through a proper public consultation on this subject matter.

266
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:39,180
The UK government has agreed to review the working of these provisions by the Intellectual Property Office no later than April 2019.

267
00:55:40,000 --> 00:56:00,010
我同意與觀察和評論由專門知識財產部作出，亦都分享和贊同由最近提交的由香港律師公會，部分由丹尼斯霍克議員選區，的英國的態度是新的，並非無控制。

268
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:00,660
Overseas.

269
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,400
所以，是唯一一國在世界有噉樣條款。

270
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:15,900
Any exploitation of copyright must be made by way of contracts. The contract provides rewards and incentives for investors to invest in copyright products.

271
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:35,180
作為法律社會， has rightly pointed out，自由貿易合同 plays a vital role in Hong Kong's free market economy， and freedom to contract is a fundamental common law principle which should not be lightly interfered within the absence of compelling and properly thought out reasons.

272
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:47,810
In fact, digital networks offers new opportunities for content providers and innovators to contract directly with the end users of their respective works at a much lower cost.

273
00:56:48,340 --> 00:57:00,000
Those users who want to use the copyrighted materials under the fair dealing exceptions may still be able to do so if they feel that a contractual provision limits an exception.

274
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:09,920
There is no evidence that the users cannot take the benefit of fair dealing exceptions because of a contractual provision limits such exceptions.

275
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:26,920
According to the chairperson of the bar association and a leading copyright specialist, Ms Winnie Tam, in recent press interview, acknowledges that Hong Kong is in urgent need to pass the copyright amendment bill to combat online piracy.

276
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:46,090
Mr. Tem placed the bill, which contains some of the broadest copyright exceptions in the world, as the government grants the six exceptions, including for parody, satire and commenting on current affairs, which are very broad and provide greater protections than other jurisdictions.

277
00:57:47,210 --> 00:58:07,220
另一名高級顧問和前立法會議員Ronnie Tongaia認為，引入限制合約法例將傷害合約精神，因為它會施加限制自由合約，並影響索償損害的侵權案件的民事責任。

278
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:12,660
但fails to address the fundamental issue of criminal copyright infringement cases.

279
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:34,200
Furthermore, I would like to add that, like the UK counterparts, Hong Kong copyright industries have expressed their grave concern over the issue and strongly oppose any introduction of contract override provisions at this stage, because the change would have a greater economic impact on them.

280
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,330
As it create uncertainties regarding the working of the present licensing arrangements.

281
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:44,720
Giving rise to more disputes and putting creative industry at risk.

282
00:58:45,000 --> 00:59:00,580
如果政府支持成長一個活躍的創意產業，或許我們應該聽從版權投資者，因為公平交易例外的益處仍然存在，作為對那些不是合同雙方的人的承諾。

283
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:21,290
在一些，版權所有者可能就其版權對任何使用者採取行動，無論是透過合約或透過版權法。如果存在合約，版權所有者只能透過合約爭議來執行，因為任何聲稱的版權侵犯都是不當的。

284
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:25,210
會被 inevitably met by the fair dealing exception.

285
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:41,060
Nevertheless, I share with the views of the administration that Hong Kong court will unlikely to enforce any contractual clause purporting to override exceptions because of consumer protection law and of public policy.

286
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:51,550
On the contrary, the remedies available to the copyright owners are different in the case of breach of contract as compared to those in copyright infringement.

287
00:59:52,320 --> 01:00:04,760
such an injunctive and related relief, account of profit, on punitive damages and in some cases criminal sanction against the infringers who could be liable to a fine of.

288
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,080
50,000 per infringed copy and imprisonment up to four years.

289
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:28,860
Copyright owners must look to the contract itself for relief against a breach of contract, and they may only demand monetary damages in respect of real damage suffered, and the amount is likely to be insignificant as compared to those in copyright infringement.

290
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:44,910
In summary, I tend to agree with the view of the Intellectual Property Department and the Law Society of Hong Kong that the issue is complex and we should not likely take it on without proper public consultation on the subject matter.

291
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:59,960
Furthermore, Hong Kong should learn from the experience in other leading jurisdictions. So far, only the UK has override provisions. Before we consider whether there is benefit in introducing such provisions into our copyright law.

292
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:11,790
In the meantime, end users are same as before, still able to enjoy the free use of copyrighted materials that are within the scope of the fair dealing exceptions.

293
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,420
Mr. President.

294
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:24,950
Why should Hong Kong rush to follow the UK example and incorporate such a proposed amendment into the bill at this stage?

295
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:30,360
Why not stay wary to keep in view of the impact of the UK's implementations?

296
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,810
It is advisable to get more convincing empirical evidence.

297
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:48,060
我歡迎積極的姿勢，由行政會承諾在法案通過後立即進行全面的審查，以檢討英國的實例。

298
01:01:49,870 --> 01:02:00,810
For all these reasons, I cannot accept the amendments suggested by Mr. by Mr. Dennis Quock and will not support them. I so submit. Thank you, President.

299
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,930
咁其他委員要發言。

300
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,040
何秀蘭議員。

301
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,330
誒，陳志全議員。

302
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,990
要求點算法定人數？

303
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:21,280
誒，現在係會議廳裏邊係有足夠嘅發電量。

304
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:26,490
誒請議員喺會議廳裏邊嘅時候保持肅靜。

305
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,770
我收難議員。

306
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:37,670
誒好啊！多謝主席嚇。

307
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,190
我再次再次提出要求，點算法定人數？

308
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,610
誒請議員盡快返回座位。

309
01:16:42,980 --> 01:17:02,990
好，秀蘭議員請你發言。好啊，多謝主席。誒，我首先趁馬鳳國議員啱啱講完，我就誒盡量回應咗佢頭先嘅論點先。誒，馬議員咧頭先係誒講咗好多關於英國嘅例子。其實當英國引入呢個誒。

310
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:23,240
誒合約凌價嘅條文嘅時候咧，佢哋係針對一個好簡單、好基本嘅消費者行為，就係因為以前咧誒呢啲電子嘅誒消費品冇噉嘅普遍，大家唔係有一啲好輕便嘅誒設施可以聽除。

311
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:43,250
新音樂，所以咧就嗰個音樂嘅版權就係用以前嘅科技嗰個生活模式咧，就係買一隻誒黑膠唱片，後來變咗為定錄音帶，變為C.D.，但係到後來有誒呢個蘋果公司出咗咁多咁方便。

312
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:52,240
可以隨身攜帶喺裏邊有成三千幾隻歌隨意去聽嘅物品嘅時候咧，就出現咗一個情況啦，就係當。

313
01:17:52,700 --> 01:18:12,710
一個消費者，佢本來已經畀咗錢去買一個版權物品，以歌曲為例啦。如果佢自己本身擁有幾樣呢啲電子消費品，嚇，佢想將佢買咗嘅歌轉落佢其他個人嘅電子消，

314
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:16,980
廢品嗰度咧，以前嘅條例係不容許嘅。

315
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:37,270
所以，當個生活模式改變，大家越嚟越普遍可以應用呢啲科技，每人可能揸住兩個智能電話，一個就係隨身音樂嘅儲存器嘅時候咧，咁呢個豁免呢個法例嘅更新就變為有需要。

316
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:40,490
而佢哋當時個法例更新咧，就係容許。

317
01:18:40,770 --> 01:19:00,780
個別消費者將佢買咗嘅版權歌曲再放落去自己其他嘅電子消費設施嗰度，個豁免係咁窄咁簡單嘅啫。咁當然啦，佢哋誒對於版權嗰個更新咧，其實都有一個好漫長嘅。

318
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:20,790
過程喺二零零六年有嘅Gowers Report，然後去到二零一一年咧有Hargreaves Report喺下議院嗰度咧係獲得接受係通過成為法例，但係去到上議院喺進行審議嘅時候咧就係有不少嘅辯論。咁呢個咧。

319
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:32,800
誒，大家都好勤力嚇，去睇曬呢啲記錄，然後喺呢度咧可以幫到香港市民去睇其他嘅普通法統國家係點樣處理。當時辯論裏邊咧。

320
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:53,180
亦都有講到歐洲嘅模式，佢哋為咗用一個好方便嘅方式去處理呢啲新嘅電子消費品設施同埋版權人收益嗰個問題咧，佢哋就諗到一個方法，就係不如咁啦，逢買機咧就要先畀一個特許費先。咁喺法。

321
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:59,380
國嗰度咧，每人買一個呢啲電子消費嘅設施咧，就先畀十五蚊歐羅，即係香港就係。

322
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:19,680
一百八十蚊到啦。咁但係無論你聽唔聽嗰只歌，無論你用唔用即係嗰個嗰個音樂，你買嗰個誒誒智能電話係咪要嚟聽音樂都好咧，都要都要畀呢個特許費。咁變咗咧，你對消費者其實係唔公道嘅，並且。

323
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:39,690
當呢個電話壞咗之後，要再買第個機嘅時候咧，再畀過噉，所以咧，大家睇到其實你唔同嘅設施、唔同嘅管制咧，都會有佢嘅即係對某方面嘅好處，或者係對消費者有佢嘅唔好處。咁但係我是必要喺呢度講翻清楚，當時英國嗰個。

324
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:59,700
討論咧，其實係一個好窄、好窄嘅範圍。咁翻翻嚟，我哋香港啊，郭榮亨議員提呢幾個修訂啦。其實嗰個目的咧，好簡單。正如啊郭議員頭先講，就係希望法例賦予市民資訊流通嘅保障咧。

325
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:19,920
係唔會畀人同人或者人同機構之間，或者機構同之間嘅合約去凌駕嗰個原則。簡單就係合約裏邊嘅條款係唔應該畀法例更加多嘅限制。如果法例放，

326
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:39,930
寬咗我哋嗰個豁免，例如好似政府今次講誒批評啊、評論啊、報導啊、戲仿啊、各樣嘢啊、教學啊、接受教學目的啊嗰啲咁咧，係可以有一個豁免嘅時候，喺人同機構之間簽嗰個合約，就唔應該有呢啲超。

327
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:59,940
符法例，畀普通人嗰個保障。咁而今次郭榮亨議員嗰個修訂咧，雖然就係有六條咁多啦，其實就係同樣嘅性質，就係放喺不同嘅範圍。噉就包括第三十九條嘅批評評論。

328
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:19,950
引用及報導和評論時事嘅豁免，以及第三十九A條嘅戲仿、諷刺、營造滑稽及模仿嘅豁免啊。主席或者你陣間更正我讀骨溪定滑溪啦嚇，取俗定係跟翻正確嘅讀法。第同埋咧就擺咗喺第四十一A。

329
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:27,610
呢條教學接受教學目的而作嘅公平處理，咁呢度咧雖然只係三個範圍，但係因為佢後邊咧。

330
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:48,250
允許嘅作為嗰度咧，係會再出現多次，所以咧就係其實係三對嘅豁免，但係主要咧就係喺三個範圍裏邊。咁其實國議員有提其他嘅範圍嘅，不過主席裁決咧就係今次今次政府畀出嚟嘅修訂草案咧係冇涉。

331
01:22:48,250 --> 01:23:02,780
及到嗰啲範圍，所以嗰啲咧就唔批准。咁呢個咧就真係慢慢下一次咧，即係再嚟嘅時候咧，我哋係要爭取將呢啲合約凌格嘅條款咧，係擺埋落去嗰啲範圍嗰度。

332
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:07,260
咁誒，正如郭議員頭先講嘅，其實版權商咧。

333
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:27,830
都唔知道即係想點㗎喎！真係真係喺呢個草案審議完結咗十二月中開始嘅階段咧，其實版權誒持有人大聯盟咧，即係佢哋嗰個立場，我覺得都係比較反覆。當然，即係對嗰個市民嘅檢控同唔檢控，佢哋開始嘅時候就。

334
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:41,750
話唔會告嘅，唔會幫手告嘅，得不償失。誒，多翻作出保證，咁亦都係細神劈完就話，就轉政府告都好啦。佢哋係唔會提供證供，等政府告唔成嘅。

335
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:47,290
咁但係咧，如果你真係誒有咁硬正，

336
01:23:47,570 --> 01:24:07,580
咁堅實嘅承諾係唔想侵犯個別市民嘅資訊流通自由，覺得起訴個別市民嘅侵權行為係得不償失，甚至令佢哋嘅社會聲譽受損添啦，即係都唔好樣唔好過啦。咁點解佢哋又唔肯接？

337
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:27,590
受郭榮亨議員提出呢個合約凌價嘅條款咧，其實如果佢哋真係真心誠意唔想告嘅話，佢哋亦都唔應該喺合約裏邊設置一啲超乎法律畀嘅闊面啦，去收緊嗰個空間啦，因為我哋擔心。

338
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:35,420
嘅係乜嘢咧？就算法律裏邊係有呢個豁免，但係如果機構同用户之間簽嘅合約，

339
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,510
係收窄咗個闊面。

340
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:47,540
凌駕於法律，咁其實將來咧，佢可以作為簽約嘅一方咧，用違約呢件事去告個別市民。

341
01:24:47,820 --> 01:25:07,830
同樣係可以係將市民帶到去法庭，令佢要經過呢啲司法訴訟啊，好繁複，亦都好擾人嘅程序。噉，所以我哋覺得，既然版權商即係你表明心跡唔想告，但係又唔肯去接受呢個合約零價，亦都好似頭。

342
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:27,840
頭先啊，郭榮亨議員咁講，其實佢哋都唔係好知道接受或者唔接受做乜。總言之，就維護咗自己嘅權利，保留最大嘅權權利先啦。咁但係調翻轉頭，我哋作為保護市民權益嘅直選議員代表，我哋必須係要喺法例裏邊。

343
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:47,850
係寫得清楚明白法律嘅保障咧，喺合約裏邊係唔可以被掃除、被收窄嗱。主席其實合誒合約咧，即係呢個立約嘅自由咧，喺誒法律界誒，無論執業者或者係學者嚟講。

344
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:55,370
可以係一個哲學問題嚟嘅，嚇，誒英國普通法法統，佢係好珍惜。

345
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,570
兩個自由人。

346
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:01,890
之間以自由意志去定立。

347
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:08,410
誒規範佢哋自己行為模式嘅契約，呢個咧亦都係要。

348
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:28,730
兩個自由人係有咗呢個契約之後咧，係用嚟作一個更加堅實嘅承諾。如果違約嘅時候咧，佢哋係可以互相追究。但係要留意一點就係兩個自由人之間以自由意志去立嘅契約啊。但係時到今時今日咧，我哋睇得到。

349
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:48,740
合約咧，起碼係有即係幾種唔同嘅立約人，大家一齊去訂立嘅。一最好嘅就係剛才我哋頭先講立約精神、自由立約嗰個起源啦，就係大家都係自由意志，係平等對等嘅立約，係一個君子嘅立約。但係，

350
01:26:48,740 --> 01:27:01,030
另外一種咧，就係人同機構之間嘅合約，呢個就係我哋而家香港要處理嘅嘢啦。啊，機構咧，佢畀咗好多服務出嚟。

351
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,500
我哋好多時咧，都係會有呢個嘅誒。

352
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:25,790
即係好差嘅經驗嘅嚇，最即係最大家最常講咧，就係呢個隱私問題。你一買佢嘅服務咧，佢就後邊有成抽嘢就話啊，佢可以用你嘅個人資料啊，各樣啊噉。除非你唔用佢嘅服務，咁但係當呢種服務提供者。

353
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:31,810
數量唔多嘅時候，其實市民係冇乜選擇㗎喎。

354
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:52,100
咁當然啦，即係我哋香港最近嘅法例都改咗啦，就係要求金融機構餵你要用書面得到顧客嘅同意，然後先正可以用佢嘅個人資料。呢個係我哋自己嘅一個改進，但係未曾去到所有嘅範圍。例如當我哋去購

355
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,320
買要付款嘅電視服務嘅時候。

356
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:16,650
一隻手數曬啦，有幾多個服務提供者啊？係嘛？如果呢啲要付款嘅電視廣播機構裏邊嘅合約講明，喂，你同我買呢樣嘢啫，你睇你只能夠睇我嘅節目，你不能夠用我嘅節目內容。

357
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:26,900
去做批評啊、評論啊、報道啊，或或者戲仿、諷刺啊、營造滑稽啊呢啲嘢。咁其實咪將我哋而家立嘅法例？

358
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,970
畀市民嘅保障。

359
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,150
即刻抵消曬咯！

360
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:51,440
所以其實政府亦都係應該支持我哋呢個修訂嘅，即係當然最簡單就係局長你提我哋呢個修訂啦，就唔使分組點票，又唔使話凡事泛民議員提出就必須反對啦。但係喺呢個人同機構之間嗰個立約，其

361
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:56,450
其實係不對等嘅，即係除非我哋立下心腸唔要。

362
01:28:56,730 --> 01:29:13,840
咁但係即係接收公共資訊係現代生活嘅一部分啊嘛，點可以唔要咧？我自己個人經驗咧，就係我同一個即係有廿五年歷史嘅付費電視台，我搬屋，我去籤我份新約，籤嘅時候我識啦，我就話你唔可以用我嘅個人隱私。

363
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:31,010
佢初則咧就話唔得，噉我唯有企硬，就冒住唔睇呢個電視機構誒頻道嘅風險，我就話你唔豁免我呢樣，你一定要我個人隱私，我就唔買，我寧願唔睇。結果熬咗兩個禮拜。

364
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:51,300
然後先正可以講得點數，但係主席即係我哋呢啲咧係明白法律嘅，畀香港市民嘅保障，知道佢唔可以隨便亂用個人資料，所以我哋睇到嗰條條文細細粒字嗰啲條文，我哋識同佢據理力爭，但係普通市民唔識。

365
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,650
噉啊！好多時我哋去。

366
01:29:55,190 --> 01:30:15,200
不管係即係買電視服務啊，或者係美容健身啊，預繳式嘅服務啊，或者係去銀行開一個户口，後邊嗰條合約或者申請一個信信用卡，兩版A四紙咁多嘅條文，六號字體，哇，仲要淺灰。

367
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:35,210
灰色唔通，我哋次次去納約嘅時候，都帶埋一個律師，帶埋一個法律顧問去睇下啱唔啱我哋啱唔啱而家現行法律，然後先正簽咧，冇呢個可能嘅。所以主席即係郭榮亨議員呢個合約零價嘅修訂係刻意擺埋落去，而家政府。

368
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:55,220
畀即係市民嘅豁免嗰度咧，其實係一個好合適嘅方法。可能政府一陣間會話加牀疊屋，其實我哋法例有嘅，即係法院都唔會因為呢條合約去誒判呢個機構得直啦。咁如果唔會嘅，

369
01:30:55,220 --> 01:31:15,230
正如我頭先所講，既然你咁有信心唔會，點解你冇信心寫落去咧？呢個又係一個即係邏輯嘅問題。如果寫埋落去，令大家安心，確實呢個矛盾、呢個衝突係可以容易啲拉得埋嘅。主席一陣間咧，我會繼續發言講。

370
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:22,390
講其他誒，香港面對嘅誒呢個合約零價帶嚟畀市民陷阱嘅細則，多謝。

371
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:23,940
想支持你。

372
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:47,970
多謝主席。首先咧，多謝陳鑑林議員作為二零一四版權修訂條例草案委員會嘅主席咧，係動議咗呢一組嘅修正案嘅。呢一組嘅修正案咧，包括有第十八、十九、廿四、七十五、七十六、七十八條。噉啊，簡稱咧就係。

373
01:31:47,970 --> 01:32:07,980
誒限制合約零加成噉，大家都知道咧。呢六條修正案咧，係由郭榮亨議員咧係提出，最後咧喺法案委員會咧係以多數啊票係通過咧，而可以通過法案委員會主席陳淦林議員係提出嘅。咁陳淦林議員頭先咧，佢。

374
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:27,990
第一次發言嘅時候咧，就講佢話其實咧噉係唔代表咧誒法案委員會咧，大多數議員係支持呢一個議案㗎，因為咧只不過係誒議員提出，跟住咧大家就話介唔介意我作為主席代大家提啊噉樣。我覺得呢個講法咧係非常之誤導。

375
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:48,000
好啦，喺法案委員會每一條修正案嘅提出咧，理論上係應該經過議員嘅討論，有充分嘅討論，大家表達咗正反嘅意見之後，之後再投票睇下咧，係咪由嗰個法案委員會提出？稍後咧，我哋討。

376
01:32:48,000 --> 01:33:08,010
討論英國嘅案例嘅時候咧，當年英國咧亦都有曬正反意見喺法案委員會喺佢哋嘅類似啦，唔係佢哋唔係叫法案委員會啦，係提出嘅時候咧嘅正反論據。但係如果大家今次睇翻我哋呢個立法會，由二十名立法會議員嚇十三個建制。

377
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:28,020
派七個民主派議員誒所處理嘅法案委員會喺最後階段，郭榮亨議員提出呢誒，其實佢提出咗八條嘅，唔係六條嘅修正案嘅時候，我哋有冇經過一個充分嘅討論咧？主席，我可以話畀你聽，係絕對沒有。

378
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:48,030
啊，可能好多議員同陳鑑林議員頭先講嗰種諗法一樣，我冇所謂啦。即係法案委員會，阿陳鑑林代阿郭榮亨提出呢個修正案啫嘛。阿佢最多咪就講多一次咯，即係嚇噉。最後我哋投票都係可以反對佢㗎，所以咧跟。

379
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:52,100
根本喺法案委員會嗰度咧，就冇去正正式式。

380
01:33:52,380 --> 01:34:10,730
去深入討論過郭榮亨議員提出呢個修正案㗎，所以咧，我希我唔想爭拗落去喺呢度浪費太多嘅時間。但係，無論係陳監林主席定係法論委員會裏邊反對今次我哋呢一組合評辯論呢六條修正案嘅議員，請你承認。

381
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:19,960
你當其時喺過去嘅日子，係冇深入研究過郭榮鏗當日提出嗰八條修正案，你哋覺得冇所謂。

382
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:40,250
嚇，抑或者係漏招啊！根本你哋就諗就冇諗住會過到，或者過唔過到都唔緊要，係甩碌你認咗佢就得㗎啦。因為客觀環境而家喺我哋，當然好似你哋咁諗啦。就算係陳監林提好、郭榮亨提好、陳志全提好，最後一條都。

383
01:34:40,250 --> 01:35:00,260
都冇得過，唔理你有冇道理嚇，噉就講完啦。但係你哋唔好再拗話咧。由法案委員會通過通過主席陳監林議員提出咧，同一個議員自己提出咧，係冇分別㗎。呢個係好可笑㗎嚇。咁以後法案委員會。

384
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:20,750
提出嘅議案同議員，譬如好似黃毓民議員，佢提出咗九百零三條誒動議。大家知道，跟鬼法案委員會咧係冇空間去逐條逐條去研究黃毓民議員嗰個嗰啲動議㗎。咁所以最後就佢亦都唔唔要求法案委員會提啦。噉啊，主席最後裁決咗啦，呢個就唔講。

385
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:40,760
講住啦，講到黃旭文議員嘅時候，先講蔣麗雲議員咧，就話我哋即係要好仔細噉樣講啲細節啦。咁頭先咧幾位誒議員都冇好仔細、好有層次噉樣講誒呢六條修正案，所以咧，我想花少少時間咧係仔細啲講一次嚇，畀大家去知道。

386
01:35:40,760 --> 01:36:00,770
郭榮亨議員提出嘅第十八條喺誒藍紙草案裏面第十八條修正案咧，就係對應翻咧係版權條例第三十九條嘅。第三十九條咧係包括批評、評論、引用、報導同埋評論時事。嗱呢一組誒呢六。

387
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:03,400
個項目咧，大家要要誒留意嘅。

388
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:21,120
批評、評論同埋報導時事，或者當其時咧叫做新聞報導咧，喺原原有嘅誒法案咧已經存在㗎啦啊！咁呢個喺三十九條咧係加入咗乜嘢咧？加入咗引用同埋評論時事呢兩個範疇。

389
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:41,610
第十九條，第十九條修正案咧係新增第三十九A啊，呢個就係一個戲辱啦，戲謔、諷刺、營造滑稽同埋模仿。其實過去咧喺合拼辯論裏邊，誒喺誒二讀辯裏邊咧，我哋都冇真真正正咧辯論過呢四。

390
01:36:41,610 --> 01:37:00,260
個呢四個範疇嘅誒闊面，究竟佢真係運用起上嚟嘅時候咧，會遇到啲乜嘢嘅難度㗎？大家咧好似想當然噉樣咧，就諗啊寫咗未就係佢會發揮佢嘅作用咯。對唔住，其實咧。

391
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:20,550
戲仿、諷刺、營造滑稽同模仿咧，第一並無法律定義。並無法律定義喺法案委員會裏邊，政府咧都係用字典嘅定義喺字典嘅定義咧，所以大家咧亦唔好想當然咁睇喎嗱。因為呢part我唔係詳細辯論呢樣嘢，我只係舉一個例子。

392
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:25,490
譬如模仿，啊，模仿係咪可以得到豁免咧？

393
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:45,870
對唔住，嗰個模仿咧，唔係大家諗嗰個imitation嗰個模仿喺法例裏邊咧。誒嗰個模仿咧係pastiche，呢個其實唔係英文嚟嘅，係法文嚟嘅。喺字典嘅定義係在風格上仿效另一作品，藝術家為某為某時期作品所作出嘅模仿。

394
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:47,110
嗱。

395
01:37:48,250 --> 01:38:03,210
唔係深入討論，我而家先係點出咗嗰個問題所在。第二十四條修正案、男子草案裏邊咧，係第四十一A、四十一咧係為教學或接受教學嘅目的而作出嘅公平處理。

396
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:06,060
呢個係新定係舊咧？

397
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,680
呢個係半新舊。

398
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:28,970
因為其實咧，我哋而家成日話六個豁免範圍咧。我諗我哋在座嘅議員咧，如果你喺出邊接住問咧，叫人講嗰六個範圍咧，我敢寫包單，主席同你輸到係冇一成嘅議員咧係可以答到好清楚咁講到嗰六個豁免範圍，因為政府咧或者傳媒啦一路咧。

399
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:34,440
去講嗰六個擴面範圍咧，就會講戲仿、模仿、滑稽、諷刺。

400
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:45,700
誒誒提提醒主席，即係剛才陳志全議員一路發言嘅咧，我睇唔到佢同我哋而家辯論嘅議題有直接關係。你可唔可以？

401
01:38:45,980 --> 01:39:05,990
除咗口罩，講我聽唔到你講乜嘢。對唔住，即係我我聽唔到陳志全語言講嘅發言咧，同我哋而家辯論緊嘅contract override有咩直接嘅關係？係，當局主席。陳志全語言請你盡快翻。主席，我我我從來冇離開過。我先先要點出喺藍紙草案裏邊十八。

402
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:15,820
十九、廿四、七啊、五、七啊、六、七啊、八，裏邊相關嘅範圍，先至在未來嘅發言咧，係逐步分去進入點解呢啲地方去加入。

403
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:36,110
限制合約凌駕性嘅條款合理，我會我會好，我講咗亦唔會重複。我亦議員咧，唔應該花太多時間咧去將個條文嘅原文讀出嚟，因為我冇讀我冇讀原原文讀出嚟，主席呢個原文好長嘅，如果我成個三廿九A讀出嚟咧，係讀分幾鐘㗎，我而

404
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:56,120
而家只係將個標題去去講出嚟，大家知主席好冇問題。嗱，為教學或接受教學目的而作嘅公平處理咧，其實係一個半新舊嘅闊面。點樣叫做半新舊嘅闊面咧？因為喺二零一一年嘅版權修訂條例嗰度咧已經出現㗎啦。但係因為當年咧個版權修訂條例咧。

405
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:12,650
係胎死腹中，所以咧，今次咧喺呢個法案裏邊咧，係加入翻落去呢個條例嗰度。所以其實六大豁免範圍係乜嘢咧？頭先講嘅砌房、模仿滑梯、營造嗰啲係一個嘅啫，嗰一個就叫做。

406
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,070
模仿，即係同一類嚟嘅。

407
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,800
跟住又引用啦。

408
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:26,790
跟住頭先我講嗰個係評論時事，呢個係三個新新嘅啦。咁仲有三個範疇係乜嘢咧？嗰三個範疇咧就係。

409
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:37,660
為教育界為授課而傳播版權作品嘅豁免，其實咧四十一A咧係都足足及到呢個範疇。

410
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:43,710
第五咧就係讓互聯網服務提供者快取處理數據提出豁免。

411
01:40:43,990 --> 01:41:00,820
第六咧就係允許媒體轉讓嗱，我講翻清楚畀大家聽，就正如何秀蘭議員頭先講嗰個合約零加成喺一張唱片嗰度，點解會出現呢一個問題？我哋法例裏邊明明係寫咗。

412
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:04,920
媒體轉換係可以有豁免嘅。

413
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:20,900
即係話，我買張CD翻屋企，我將佢壓做MP3、壓做數碼數碼檔案，放入我電話，放入我iPad，呢個係豁免嘅。但係，如果個合約嘅零加成係寫咗出嚟話係唔得嘅。

414
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:41,190
噉係咪就話喺法例條文裏邊畀我哋豁免嘅嘢，會因為喺唱片封面、啊唱片封底或者唱片個膠套寫咗呢句説話而去去刪除咧？嗱，頭先個三樣咧，跟住另外七十五、七十六、七十八咧，我就唔會重。

415
01:41:41,190 --> 01:42:01,200
復啦，因為呢個咧係一組，係一個對應對稱，同十八、十九、廿四咧係對稱嘅。佢嘅分別在於乜嘢咧？佢嘅分別咧就係在於七十五、七十六、七十八咧係講緊喺表演中嘅權利嚇。咁其實另外，郭榮亨議員咧都提出咗。

416
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:21,210
第三十八條㗎，但係主席咧，你就誒裁決話咧，因為政府喺呢啲條文之中並無提出修正案，所以係唔畀佢提出㗎。三十八條咧牽涉嘅係研究同埋私人研習。主席，你冇錯㗎嚇，因為按照傳統咧。

417
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:36,060
如果喺藍紙草案裏邊冇提出嘅修正案咧，係並不能係被議員作出修正㗎。但係咧，呢個咧就睇到咧政府喺立法過程之中咧，佢嘅。

418
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,830
迂腐啦！

419
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:58,150
通過咗呢一啲修正條文之後咧，就會令到法例上邊咧有一啲唔均稱嘅地方。其實唔係淨係喺我哋呢條法例會見到佢咧，就用呢個理由咧就作為噉，不如你唔好改啦。就算我哋辯論到最後覺得啊，好有道理喎。阿郭榮亨議員你或者民主派議員你提出嗰啲問題。

420
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:07,240
但係都係唔改得。啊，陳議員，我認為你發言咗十一分鐘咧，都未曾直接講到你點解支持或者反對。

421
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,200
嗯。

422
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:28,560
而家我哋要主席嗰啲修正案，當然咧，我係支持阿郭榮亨議員咧，唔係喺個陳監林議員代郭榮亨議員提出嘅呢六條修正案㗎。但係咧喺我提出理據之前，我先先咧都要誒批評一下郭榮亨議員先嚇，因為郭榮亨議員咧其實都係流招嘅嚇嗱三十八。

423
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:48,570
條你就將佢裁決為，因為唔喺男子草案裏邊啦。其實男子草案裏邊咧，仲有頭先我提出嘅，譬如媒體互換啦，譬如為誒研習教學目的啦，同埋誒呢個快取檔案咧，嗰啲咧，其實各樣聽完都或者我哋咧都可以將。

424
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:53,320
合限制合約靈格性嘅條款咧，係放入裏邊。好啦。

425
01:43:53,710 --> 01:44:05,380
嗱，限制合約靈格性嘅條款，嗰條條款其實乜嘢咧？就係某合約條款犯歧義，係防止或者限制。

426
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:15,720
作出任何根據本條不會構成侵犯版權嘅作為，憑藉該有關條款不得強制執行。

427
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:24,790
咁咧，反對呢條條反對郭榮亨議員呢一個加入呢個説話嘅人，佢會最大嘅誒？

428
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:34,320
誒指出會係乜嘢咧？就係話立約自由、合約自由。嗱，一份合約。

429
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,320
係。

430
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:44,570
版如果喺我哋版權條例之下咧，係版權擁有人同埋使用者之間。

431
01:44:44,850 --> 01:45:02,080
去替結嘅一個誒，所謂透過合約去同意一啲嘢啊！咁使用者咧，其實喺呢條條例裏邊咧，有兩最少可以有兩種人㗎，包括個人用户，即係或者我哋網民啦；第二係中介平台。

432
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:09,450
噉佢哋通過呢個合約咧，就話全部或者某部分嘅版權使用限制。

433
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:17,250
呢個版權使用限制而家講緊嘅咧，就係我哋喺條例草案裏邊所賦予嘅豁免。

434
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,470
並不履行。

435
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:19,920
啊！

436
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:40,250
咁但係，大家就話哦，原來嗰個係版權使用者同意嘅。啊，頭先陳淦林議員佢嗰個都話啦，即係你自己同意嘅。如果你自己同意同人進入咗呢一個合約關係裏邊，咁到時你自己違反呢個合約關係，對。

437
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:56,890
方向你追究法律責任係合情合理嘅。嗱，一般情況之下，如果真係大家喺一個公平，雙方係公平嘅環境，係好清楚嗰個條文，而進互相簽署呢個合約。

438
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:07,840
佢應該係受到尊重，但係喺數碼世界裏邊，究竟而家講緊呢個合約，林嘉升嘅合約嘅簽署或者嗰個。

439
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:26,190
版權持有人、版權擁有人同埋版權使用者係咪一個對等關係，定係一個非常傾斜嘅關係咧？嗱，傳統合約就係有張紙喺度，有律師好冇律師好，大家畫只龜，吸個印落去，係用書面形式嘅。

440
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:30,470
但係而家喺電子數碼世界咧，合約嘅形式係點咧？

441
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:32,340
係電子合約。

442
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:52,660
電子合約同傳統合約有咩唔同咧？傳統合約咧就係嗰個立約人咧，或者合約提供者、合約草擬人咧，佢咧有個責任向對方咧係詳細解釋個合約。譬如我哋去gym嗰度要籤一份合約，水蛇春咁長，九尺咁長，噉你唔可以話乜？

443
01:46:52,660 --> 01:47:07,960
都唔睇，眯埋眼叫佢簽個字落去㗎。佢有一個責任咧，係要去解釋呢個合約畀對方知道。但喺數碼世界上邊咧，呢個解釋合約嘅責任咧，就好似免除咗喎，因為我嘅合約咧就係攤咗出嚟。

444
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:15,080
下次補充，前總監言，主席，嗯，我都係發言咧，就係誒。

445
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,850
支持啊！

446
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:37,610
陳監林委主席代郭榮亨提出嘅修正案。不過雖然如此咧，我都想借呢個機會咧，就問一問，透過你問啊，誒始作俑者嘅郭榮亨，關於佢嘅提出嘅修訂。嗱，當然咧，我好清楚見到而家你嘅修訂咧，就係關於誒喺誒草案嘅十八。

447
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:57,620
十九、廿四、七廿五、七廿六、七廿八呢幾條裏邊咧，係加入呢一個所謂誒合約凌駕性，即係具體講就係合約條款咧，就誒凡其二是防止或者限制作任何根據本條不會構成侵犯版權嘅行為，憑藉該有關條款不得強制執行。嗱，主席，我想。

448
01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:00,090
問咧就係誒，其實。

449
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:19,680
我察覺到即係佢而家呢個修訂咧，就係因為男男子重案咧就有修訂呢誒呢六條啦，所以咧就喺呢六條裏邊咧加入呢一個所謂合約凌駕性嘅條款喺裏邊。但係其實咧係咪作為一個版權條例咧？我誒阿阿郭榮亨議員係咪可以解釋下？係咪其實？

450
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:40,150
除咗呢六條之外，其他地方係咪都應該要有一個所謂誒合約凌駕性喺度？只不過限制於因為作為一個議議員嘅修訂咧，你唔可以修訂誒政府咪冇提交嘅冇提交嘅一個嘅誒修正案，你就唔可以改，所以你就唔可以咁做。但係如果作為一個

451
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:51,750
一個即係如果你誒誒誒誒由由頭草葉起咧，就應該有一個成個條文裏邊咧，就有一個合約凌駕性喺度，係咪合適啲咧？噉樣，呢個第一，第二咧。

452
01:48:52,530 --> 01:49:12,540
啱啱可能局長都會提到㗎啦，就話香港有一個叫不誒不公平嘅合約法咁上下嘅嘢嘅，噉就即是話咧誒原則上嚟講咧，香港嘅法例咧就誒唔可即係唔即係訂一啲合約咧就唔可以即係超越香港嘅法例噉樣。咁當然咧打起官司上嚟咧就。

453
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:27,860
如果喺呢一個條款裏邊加入呢一個所謂合約零加升，就易打好多。咁誒，要去到法庭去申請某個合約係即係不公平，所以係無效。咁可能嗰個嗰嗰個打喺官司上嚟咧，就。

454
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:48,180
就難好多啦噉嘅樣。我希望啊，郭議員陣間能夠誒發言誒，即係回應一下主席。其實呢啲嘢咧可以喺委員會裏邊傾嘅，不過咧，實際上去到委員會後期，當我哋誒啲議員提呢一個法誒修訂嘅時候咧，實際上個討論空間唔係好多啊，即係各個各有個提啦噉樣樣。咁所以咧就誒我。

455
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:54,860
呢啲嘅討論其實可以喺法案委員會討論，但係而家咧，我哋只有用呢個時間咧，就希望大家回應一下。

456
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,520
主席，關於呢個所謂。

457
01:49:57,230 --> 01:49:58,960
版權嘅合約咧。

458
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:10,740
喺誒舊世代同新世代都有啲唔同嘅。而家呢個數碼年代裏邊咧，好唔少嘅版權產品咧，已經唔係咧，已經唔係咧。

459
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:17,330
係好似阿阿阿阿梁繼春員噉樣樣攞盒CD上嚟。

460
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:37,620
跟住咧就揭開佢睇睇裏邊後面有冇合約。頭先啊，邊個所講嗰啲咩font size六啊嗰啲咧，而家已經係舊㗎啦。如果你而家去買一啲誒版權產品，例如一啲軟件，又或者呢一個遊戲，唔少呢啲軟件同埋遊戲咧，買嘅時候係點？

461
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,380
點買咧？

462
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:53,810
網上購買嘅啫，咁網上購買咧，噉你要你同意即係agree啦嚇，跟住咧佢會彈一即係唔係唔係跟住，你同意之前咧就有一大版嗰啲合約喺度，嗰啲合約裏邊咧可能你一路噉樣scroll落去咧，scroll誒。

463
01:50:54,100 --> 01:51:00,100
三兩分鐘咧，先scroll到底，然之後先可以click做agree同意噉嘅樣，好啦。

464
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:10,110
老老實實、客觀啲咁講，誒，頭先阿阿阿何生語言都提，事實咧，香港人都明白，就算香港嘅法例咧，香港嘅法例。

465
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:30,720
公平好唔公平都好啦。你為咗香港嘅法例噉啊，心甘命抵啦。香港咁多人法例，係咪條條法例你都睇你都睇暈曬？誒，你都明白曬，所以你唔犯法咧噉樣樣，梗係唔可能啦，係咪先啦？咁但係，既然香港嘅法例定咗啦嚇，香港市民要遵守法例，咁違法就違違法香港嘅法例。

466
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:39,030
但係如果你話有一個叫做不公平，誒唔係有一個叫做counteroffer，就我買一個產品，頭先我所講嗰啲噉樣樣，裏邊有一啲嘅條款。

467
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:47,770
合乎香港嘅法例，唔係，係即係誒超越香港法例容許嘅嘢，噉我唔覺意係click咗，噉佢可以告我咯。

468
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:54,770
嗱，呢個亦都好簡單嘅scenario，好簡單嘅情況。局長其實都要考慮下喺而家。

469
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:57,630
所謂呢一個嘅地球村啊！

470
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:02,840
買嘢咧，唔一定係喺呢一個香港買嘅。

471
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:05,730
買嘢唔一定喺香港買嘅，買嘢。

472
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:13,150
有啲軟件，有啲認音產品，有啲數碼產品咧，係全球噉樣去賣同買嘅。

473
01:52:13,490 --> 01:52:33,500
咁如果某啲地方嗱，究究竟個責任誰屬咧？就係究竟站就話，我買嗰個，我要睇曬所有嘅嘢條款，我先至去買。買完之後咧，我要睇下嗰個條款係咪噉樣用法咧，我先去用。咁差唔多每個人咧都要誒成為法律專家咧，先用得呢啲數碼。

474
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:41,460
賣產品定係咧賣嗰個佢覺得香港呢啲嘅法例，OK，太過唔公平啦，對佢嚇噉佢。

475
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:53,270
喺賣售賣嘅過程restrict咗，唔畀嚟香港賣噉樣樣，究竟個責任喺邊度咧？阿局長，你一間起身都可以講一講。因為如果而家我哋唔少嘅數碼產品咧，其實咧。

476
01:52:53,820 --> 01:53:13,830
事實上喺一個地球村裏邊咧，係超越國界、超越地域嚇。噉啊，阿阿局長你都身兼數職啦，其中一樣嘢要推越推廣呢個數碼產品。香港同樣香港賣嘅誒版權產作品嘅嘢咧，亦都會可能有機會賣去呢一個嘅世界各地。噉係咪同樣？

477
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:33,840
響香港嘅版權賣嘅時候，亦都擁有呢一個所謂即係合作凌駕性。我哋香港賣嘅數碼產品，可唔可以訂立一啲條款，超越美國或者係歐洲地方嘅國家嚇凌駕於佢哋嗰個嘅法例咧？噉嘅樣。咁喺呢個前提之下，我覺得咧，我哋如果今日

478
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:53,850
阿郭榮亨嘅議員呢個修訂能夠獲得局長接納，其實局長應該一早考慮呢個接納咧。就唔單止即係我相信阿郭榮亨跟都會話，由於嗰個法例嘅修訂嘅侷限性，所以咧佢好滲序地咧就要將一條簡單嘅條款加落去六條嘅修訂裏邊。其實可能呢一個嘅條款等喺。

479
01:53:53,850 --> 01:54:04,330
即係一個一個一個總會上面咧，係更加合適都未定嘅。阿謝偉聰岌岌頭，我希望跟佢起身講一講，係咪噉嘅安排更好啲？其實如果局長，

480
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:23,730
你立咗《國榮亨》嗰個修訂，接喺頭咧，咁咧，我覺得可能係一個對呢條條例嚟計啊，可能仲更加理想嘅，好過咧就好累贅啲喺三十喺三十八括弧三三廿九括弧六三廿九A括弧二。

481
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:31,080
二四一括弧五，二四一A括弧二，二四二A括弧四A。

482
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:35,890
我如果冇數漏咧，最少七七度地方加入呢個修訂。

483
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:44,250
有啲累贅同埋侵贅，但係加完之後咧，都唔係萬法調中，都唔係包羅曬所有呢個版權條例裏邊。

484
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:58,790
即使可能啊，郭榮亨都有會留招咧，就係有啲地方咧係仍然存在咧個合約凌駕性嘅空間喺度嘅，咁所以嗰個嗰個嘅狀態係唔理想嘅，誒同。

485
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:04,280
以前啊，嗰個年代去比較，即係以前買嘢就可能係誒。

486
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:24,660
有一個嘅版權嘅產品，後面有啲附加嘅條款、合約嘅條款嚇，咁咧就好細字噉樣樣。咁嗰個都唔少咧，係挑戰嚇你細粒字啊，放大鏡睇完噉樣樣。但係而家新世代用嗰個數碼產品買買買買數碼產品嘅時候咧，實上咧。

487
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:37,640
我相信大部分嘅市民咧都唔會好詳細，就算詳細睇啊，即係坦白講句，你喺買買首歌、買套戲度，你scroll嘅時候，你同意到咧，可能。

488
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:42,110
你睇就真認真去睇都好啦，你都唔一定明。

489
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:47,430
因為嗰啲各國嘅語言啊，各國嘅法例咧，可能都唔同。

490
01:55:49,190 --> 01:55:52,820
我希望局長跟都都都都都都。

491
01:55:53,100 --> 01:56:13,110
回應一下啦，係嘛？即係如果唔少嘅現金產品真係唔喺香港即係出品嘅，啊，但係亦都可能係售賣到香港，而售賣嘅途徑咧係與傳統嘅方法唔同。即係頭先所講咩叫傳統都難講啦。將來可能傳統嘅方法就係咩咧？

492
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:20,160
就係網上嘅啦，例如買咩啊？買本書都係啦，係嘛？我我相信都唔少朋友。

493
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:32,130
喺唔好講咩名啦，咩傻嗱噉樣買啲書嚟睇嘅嚇，有啲人都即係中意睇呢一個用平板電腦啊等等嚟到去睇一啲佢喺網上購到嘅書噉樣樣。

494
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:52,420
咁呢啲咧都係有一個合約嘅條款喺裏邊。咁如果合約條款如果有零加成嘅時候咧，咁對版權使用者有啲咩嘅風險，有啲咩嘅危機咧，係好難嘅。而實際上政府都答唔到咁多啦，我相信係嘛？因為點講啦？美國法例同英國唔同，同埋其。

495
01:56:52,420 --> 01:57:02,730
其他地區嘅法例亦都會唔同，咁所以我希望誒各議員亦回應我兩個問題，不公平誒嗰個嘅誒合約會唔會？

496
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:12,970
已經足夠，咁當然啦。佢提提提得，梗係覺得唔足夠，所以佢先提啦。第二咧，就係其實係咪加咗呢七款之外咧？

497
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:33,280
加咗呢一個七個嘅修訂之後咧，係已經解決咗呢個零加升。咁誒，呢個就我問阿郭榮興議員，佢因為佢提出修訂。第二樣我想透過主席你問阿局長嘅咧，就係其實局長真係咪有冇考慮過咧？就係吸納咗阿郭榮亨議員嗰個修訂，就加一個條款，就成個法例咧都有一個。

498
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,150
嘅，誒，即係。

499
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:49,380
係咪凌駕性喺度？呢個係咪一個可以解決到更加理想嘅問題？咁故之然就係頭先我問過幾個問題，就係喂，咁啲使用者買世界各地嘅產品嘅時候，佢點樣可以？

500
01:57:50,520 --> 01:58:00,580
冇呢一個合作靈活性嘅前提之下，保護到佢權益咧，係咪啊，局長你都可能有機會買下啲地方世界各地嘅？

501
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:05,520
數碼產品，書又好，電影又好，歌曲好，或者其他遊戲都好啦。

502
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:08,360
你係咪都會好似誒？

503
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:18,400
你係律師，你係咪會每個條文睇曬，然之後先去買？定係你覺得唔使睇都唔會觸犯合約裏邊嘅？

504
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:31,180
法例嘅規定，嚇，即係我頭先都講過，即係法例香港法例，你明又好唔明又好，嚇觸犯咗都有呢個風險㗎啦。但係而家問題就係超越咗呢個法例。

505
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:46,040
合約裏邊，如果違反咗，係有呢一個所謂被呢一個民事起訴嘅可能性。噉啊，局長，你可唔可以教一啲市民嚇，即係佢有冇啲乜嘢嘅誒做法係可以？

506
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:50,610
安全保證啲嚇，我暫時發言到呢度啦。希望誒局長回應一下。

507
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:52,830
我睇番魚。

508
01:58:54,170 --> 01:59:14,180
主席誒，今朝喺誒一開始嘅時候，陳監林我哋嘅草案委員會嘅主席咧，佢發言嘅時候咧，就特別係指出咧，即係雖然呢一個嘅修訂同埋其實跟住落嚟都有一啲嘅修訂啦，就係阿陳議員佢作為主席咧，就代表委員會提出嘅，但係佢都講咧，就係。

509
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:34,190
話呢個並非就係委員會同意嘅誒嘅修訂嚇，亦都甚至乎話咧，亦都未係喺個委員會入邊做到一個廣泛嘅討論，所以先提出嘅。咁當然啦，我相信咧喺電視機旁邊嘅好多嘅市民咧，都會覺得非常。

510
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:54,200
知唔明白嘅，即係作為主席自己講話，佢自己親字。其實佢責任上，實際上今日我哋議案所有嘢印喺度，都係話陳監林議員提出的第一組修正案的條文等等。咁但係原來咧就話佢又唔同意，唔大唔再講噉，甚至乎咧仲係大部分嘅。

511
01:59:54,200 --> 02:00:14,210
建制派議員喺呢一個委員會入邊亦都佔咗多數嘅咧，原來都唔同意嘅。其實係反映咗乜嘢嘢咧？其實反映咗咧就係大家有冇尊重喺嗰個草案委員會入邊嘅工作。原來咧喺個草案委員會嗰度咧，可能當時好多嘅議員就係諗住到時嚟到大會呢度夠票就會通過得到㗎啦。

512
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:20,410
咁所以自己明唔明條條例講緊啲乜嚇？乜嘢都唔緊要嘅嚇。咁咧，所以咧。

513
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:37,840
主席，我見到咧批評佢哋咧，佢哋而家咧就決定咧就要少息啦。咁咧就係呢個咧就係最重視作為議員嘅責任嘅一種表現啦。噉啊，希望主席而家咧就要點算法定人數啦，因為呢班人咧就已經個個出去啦。

514
02:15:19,570 --> 02:15:20,860
莫乃光議員。

515
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:31,790
主席打斷我發言，我冇所謂啊！若果大家中意嘅，可以打斷三四次，即係出去再點多幾次人數都冇所謂。主席。

516
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:52,390
我就講翻嗰個委員會入邊嘅工作，即係以主席咁尷尬地要提出一個其實佢都唔支持，甚至乎政府亦都唔支持嘅嘅一個修訂。其實某程度亦都反映咗咧，誒就唔係話即係嗰個委員會入邊有冇共識嘅問題。最主要咧就係其實好多委員點樣？

517
02:15:52,390 --> 02:16:12,400
處理嗰個委員會個工作嘅態度嘅問題，咁其實當時可能大家佢哋都係諗住夠票嚟到呢一度否決咗佢，唔好咁煩啦，快啲做完嗰個草案委員會啦。主席嗰陣時又唔夠建制派嘅人喺度，咁於是咪畀我哋通過咗就主席要就提出，噉佢亦都唔反對，噉我都我都幾。

518
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:32,410
尊重啊，主席，即係呢一個嘅嘅決定，當時噉嘅做法。但係好明顯就係咧，其實咧，今日喺度嘅議員咧好多咧，都係唔明白、唔理解我哋提出嘅呢啲嘅修訂嘅內容嘅。咁而家咧就即係當然啦，大家就表面上好似好勤力坐曬喺度，咁但係咧其實係等投票嘅啫。咁其實好多議員而家唔喺度咧。

519
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:52,420
其實係準備緊佢哋嘅發言嘅，所以咧，大家你可以笑，你可以笑，可以打斷我嘅發言。大家同時肅靜。但係，如果香港市民認為咧，坐喺度等投票就係等於做咗工作，政務司司長都唔識得嗰條法例，話唔明白條法例，不過叫你通過去，認為呢個係應該嘅常態嘅話咧，噉我真係覺得香港人要。

520
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:53,600
自求多福啦！

521
02:16:55,370 --> 02:17:11,660
主席，我好希望咧，市民咧係要睇清楚咧，我哋而家喺度辯論嘅條例嘅內容係咩？一個正常嘅議會，如果要真係要深入噉樣去了解一條條例去討論嘅時候，應該係講啲乜嘢嘢？

522
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:13,520
我喺間原先坐低。

523
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:35,690
呢啲係同修定係無關嘅，即係一係列嘅廢話嚇。同埋咧就請你坐底，莫大光耀主席。即係我就覺得咧唔啱聽嘅嘢就話係廢話嘅咧，呢啲嘅態度咧即係非常之離譜。即係我而家講緊嘅咧，只係講翻成。

524
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:49,230
成個委員會點解令到呢一條嘅嘅呢一個嘅呢一個嘅修訂案係由主席去提出嘅一個背景？噉我已經講完㗎啦。我講翻而家入去咧，就講翻呢條條例入邊。

525
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:57,560
依一個嘅修訂噉，其實喺頭先啊，陳鑑林議員佢發言嗰陣時咧，佢都提到一點，就係話咧。

526
02:17:57,930 --> 02:18:00,220
合約自由係好重要嘅。

527
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:02,060
咁不過咧。

528
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:22,350
就係，除非咧，就係要保護一啲缺乏議價能力嘅少數嘅羣體。噉我呢個大概嘅轉述翻個意思啦。咁其實我又覺得，阿陳議員呢一段嘅説話，其實正正係非常之準確嘅。呢個亦都正正就係咧，當時郭榮亨議員佢提出呢個合約凌價性嘅限制嗰。

529
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:42,360
嗰個嘅原意噉，其實咧誒，今日我哋好多都講呢條個合約凌駕性嘅限制咧，最先咧就喺英國提出嘅。咁喺英國嗰度咧，其實咧誒，政府提供畀我哋嘅文件，我哋自己嘅研究都會見到咧，就係其實政府政喺英國政府。

530
02:18:42,360 --> 02:19:02,370
佢哋當時喺英國嘅上議院嗰度，佢哋係點樣解釋嘅咧？就係合約凌加性咧嘅條文咧，係可以令到使用者、消費者同埋企業咧確切而清晰噉樣瞭解到，無論個合約嘅條款為何，新定嘅公平處理嘅豁免係會適用於。

531
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:22,380
所有嘅情況，如果冇咗呢個條文咧，限制合約零加成咧，就將可以咧阻止誒有關嘅豁免所允許嘅使用，以致到咧有關嘅豁免所帶嚟嘅好處咧實現唔到。合約零加成嘅條文咧，可以確保凡喺合約、凡喺法律之中定有嘅版權豁免咧。

532
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:42,390
市民係可以喺呢個喺呢個法律作為依依據之下咧，係唔需要釐清是否有與此相反嘅一啲合約條款喺唔知邊度存在嚟避免咗咧一啲各種各樣嘅法律嘅情況。咁其實呢一個嘅説法咧，首先我想指出一點就係咧，其實當

533
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:58,190
喺呢個上議院提出咧，即係話咧，其實已經係通過咗下議院嘅。咁所以咧，其實咧，呢個立場咧係得到英國國會嘅普遍嘅支持嘅。咁但係佢個立約呢一個嘅提出呢一個修訂。

534
02:19:58,470 --> 02:20:18,480
我覺得最主要嘅兩個目標同埋重點係乜嘢咧？第一個係要清晰，第二個咧就係要放心，令到市民放心。其實亦都係我哋引入呢一係列嘅豁免嘅原因。如果唔係咧，使乜搞咁多嘢啊？啲版權人又話：，唉，我都唔告你啦，以前都冇乜告你㗎啦，咁以後都唔會啊！你

535
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:38,490
信我啦，噉樣樣噉，正正就係有陣時，我哋唔可以淨係靠信字啊嘛。我哋係要法律去做一個保障啊嘛。我哋甚至乎可能係有啲情況之係用合約去做一啲限制啊嘛。咁所以點樣做翻呢個平衡嘅位，令到個市民係可以係覺得清晰同埋放心。正正就係我哋。

536
02:20:38,490 --> 02:20:41,930
要求引入呢一個修訂嘅原因，其實咧。

537
02:20:42,380 --> 02:21:02,390
喺討論嘅時候咧，郭榮亨議員咧亦都指出，其實香港而家嘅法例入邊已經有唔少嘅地方咧，係已經有合約凌駕性嘅一啲嘅誒一啲規一啲限制合約凌駕嘅限制合約自由、限制合約凌駕嘅一啲嘅條文嘅，咁所以大家亦都唔好將呢樣嘢咧係視為一。

538
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:22,400
樣洪水猛獸，從來都冇做過嘅，全世界第一次見到嘅就係英國做咗做咗少少，其實香港都有喺其他法例入邊已經係有㗎啦。例如係僱傭條例第五十七章第二十一條有關無效條件，同埋殘疾歧視條例第四百七第四百八十七章。

539
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:26,890
將第八十三條有關合約嘅有效性及修正。

540
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:29,580
咁立約自由。

541
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:43,180
大家都係聽到好多議員都有提到政府嘅論調，今朝陳健林議員嘅講法，合約自由對於香港，啊馬逢國議員亦都係咁講，合約自由咧對於香港嘅自由市場嘅經濟係好重要。

542
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:52,010
咁呢個的確係，但係咧，大家都明白都知道呢個唔係絕對嘅，我哋唔可以就係話我同你拿不條約，然後係犯法嘅。

543
02:21:52,290 --> 02:22:12,300
咁呢個係絕對係唔得嘅。好似頭先引用嘅一啲嘅條例喺香港嚟講，的確係有用一啲限制翻合約嘅一啲嘅條文係存在嘅。咁而且啊，當局亦都有解釋啊，佢又話你唔使驚。若果真係有啲噉嘅條文嚇係唔公道嘅，噉啊，發覺係有違。

544
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:20,700
公共政策嗱，噉啊唔知咩先至係公共政策喎？噉啊又要問翻一陣，我哋好多問題要透過主席去問。

545
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:27,350
梁國雄議員，我懷疑呢度係應該好似唔夠嘅。誒，你懷疑錯啦，莫乃光議員。

546
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,440
開始。

547
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:29,480
小直。

548
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:37,950
小直，你係要制止佢呢種行為㗎，因為我去梁國雄議員請你坐低，莫乃光議。

549
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:40,150
請大家停。

550
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:45,590
請大家肅靜，梁國雄議員，我叫你坐低，請你坐低。

551
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:59,860
冇睇關要主席，即係希望你都限制一下，即係啲議員有時嗰個噉嘅行為，即係佢哋可能坐喺度太悶，有陣時要輕鬆一下噉樣樣。咁但係都唔好擾亂個議會嘅進行。

552
02:23:00,140 --> 02:23:00,930
主席。

553
02:23:01,850 --> 02:23:21,860
主席喺我哋，我哋而家講到咧，就係話，若果有啲條例咧係合約嘅條款，係發現可能係有違一啲公共政策咧，我都想透過主席咧一陣，希望郭榮亨議員都解釋一下，或者其他係律師嘅嘅同事，包括係建制派嘅同事，話畀我哋聽乜嘢先至係有。

554
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:41,870
有違公共政策，但係咧，如果係咁咧，或者係涉及一啲重大嘅大公眾利益咧，法院係可以介入。但係其實若果係噉嘅話咧，喺市民頭上嗰把刀咧，已經係好好大把，已經嗰條繩咧嚇，大家會覺得咧係好兒戲㗎啦。你要等個法庭去。

555
02:23:41,870 --> 02:24:01,880
介入，然後就幫一個小小嘅網民去解決一個佢哋可能面對呢啲噉嘅不公平嘅合約嘅問題。咁所以不可避免發生嘅咧，就係會出現一啲嘅白色恐怖。白色恐怖即係話，我哋網民如果話，咦，我哋去到一個網上嘅社交平台，社

556
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:21,890
社交媒體嘅平台，發覺咧，原來或者佢唔知啊，或者佢知啦，就發覺特別係佢知嘅時間間，佢見到原來咦話誒，原來戲房又唔得㗎，乜嘢又唔得㗎，佢唔會諗呢條法例係咪畀到佢一個嘅保障，會唔會咧個法庭會幫佢去介入？佢會諗嘅就係噉，不如咧我就。

557
02:24:21,890 --> 02:24:41,900
唔好搞啦，我就唔好去做呢一個嘅二次創作嘅行為啦。咁呢個正正咧，就係我哋希望避免嘅一個白色恐怖。就算嗰個網民係話我照做啊，試下啦。咁跟住，如果佢要面對好大嘅法律風險，要面對好高昂嘅法律嘅訴訟嘅費用。

558
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:48,890
咁呢個係唔係有公平咧？咁所以呢個咧，正正亦都係我哋引希望引入呢個嘅。

559
02:24:49,170 --> 02:24:51,850
合約凌駕性嘅限制嘅理由。

560
02:24:52,570 --> 02:25:12,580
其實立約嘅自由咧係好重要，但係咧並非係絕對嘅，咁亦都一定咧係要有一啲嘅限制。咁而呢啲限制咧，特別就係因為咧喺好多情況之下咧，大家嗰個企嘅位，大家嘅議價能力係不一樣嘅。頭先講到，譬如有邊啲嘅持份者可能係關乎。

561
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:32,590
啲一件事嘅咧，有有一啲用户啦，有創作人啦，有一啲大財團，佢哋可能亦都係一啲版權嘅擁有人啦，等等，亦都有網絡嘅公司啦，等等。好明顯咧，若果一啲普通嘅市民、普通嘅網民咧，喺成件事入邊，佢哋嗰個議價能力咧係最低。

562
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:52,600
低嘅噉，所以啊，低到啊，甚至乎啊，不存在一個議價嘅能力啊。主席，如果你去sign up，你去上網去一個嘅使用一個嘅誒平台，或者你去啊用一個嘅網上嘅誒下載或者唔係下載啦，串流串流嘅音樂或者電影嘅平台。

563
02:25:52,950 --> 02:26:00,430
入邊有一啲嘅條款，噉我都唔好講話你會唔會睇啦，或者其他嘅議員或者市民會唔會睇啦？

564
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:16,170
無論你睇與唔睇，如果你睇咗覺得喂有啲嘢真係好離譜喎，唔係好公道喎，或者都唔知係咪同香港嘅法例符合嘅噃，噉你會點做咧？你可唔可以就係話啊？我聯絡呢間公司，我同佢議價啊！

565
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:20,210
有得議咩？冇得議嘅，噉你最多唔用。

566
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:25,190
若果唔係咧，我哋就要你話點就點，搏一搏。

567
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:34,230
咁所以咧，呢個議價能力咧係根本係唔存在嘅。啊，政府文件入邊咧曾經有提過一句説話，就係話咧。

568
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:48,490
按現行嘅制度，個別嘅使用者可以同版權擁有人按雙方已定嘅條款訂立私人協議。哇，講就好聽啊！你試下去同呢個。

569
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:54,250
呢啲嘅版權嘅公司團體，去同佢一個普通嘅網民。

570
02:26:54,680 --> 02:27:12,830
甚至行政長官啊，一個超然嘅行政長官，可唔可以同呢啲嘅版權擁有人按雙方已定嘅條款訂立私人協議咧？係唔會得㗎嘛？咁所以根本就不存在呢個雙方有議價嘅機會。

571
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:33,690
而且咧喺版權呢個問題入邊咧，即係一方面我哋要面對一啲版權公司啦、大企業，亦都其實有一啲網絡公司平台，佢哋亦都係一啲大企業。咁若果你係一個小市民嘅話，一個網民嘅話，去面對，不論就係呢啲好細隻字，頭先都有議員提到啊，都唔知啲人睇定唔睇，甚至乎。

572
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:53,700
有時咧係一啲連字都冇嘅字都冇嘅，就係好似咧啊！今日我我都攞翻阿梁繼昌議員今朝攞出嚟嗰張C.D.啦。你以為攞咗張C.D.音樂，你認為點樣用就係你自己可以決定，原來唔係嘅。入邊咧亦都有一啲，甚至連細字都冇嘅。有陣時我哋買盒軟件咧，有陣時都好多細。

573
02:27:53,700 --> 02:28:13,710
字，但係去到C.D.啊、電影啊依啲咧，其實連細字都冇。但係佢畀你嗰個使用嗰陣時咧，嗰個其實有一個一啲implicit一啲其實冇講明，但係已經有嘅條款咧，其實係包括咧，你係唔可以將嗰個格式係轉換嘅。咁當然啦，喺今次嘅修訂入邊，亦都係二零一一年嗰陣時嘅修訂入邊有提出。

574
02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:24,110
出過就係要引入呢個嘅格式轉換嗰個嘅豁免啦。咁呢個如果今次條例通過嘅，大家咪可以享受到呢個豁免咯。咁但係咧，其實咧，

575
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:45,110
其實呢種噉嘅豁免咧，正正就係一個例子，就係話原來有好多嘅呢啲嘅合約。到時咧，當我哋即使呢條條例通過咗嘅時候，萬一嗰啲版權人繼續係堅持佢哋自己嘅呢一個嘅凌駕性嘅一個法嘅一個合約，就係話其實你仍然係唔可以將。

576
02:28:45,110 --> 02:29:05,120
去做格式轉換嘅，咁又會如何咧？所以重樣嘅精神，我哋就覺得咧，而家我哋希望引入嘅呢啲嘅頭先講，即係今次我哋特別係針對二次創作嘅各種嘅呢啲嘅闊面咧，一定係要得到呢個限制合約凌駕性嘅保護先至可以。咁當然啦，呢個咧我都頭先都誒向阿郭宇。

577
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:20,970
員去請教過，就係發覺咧，即係可能咧都係漏咗嚇。就係咧，我哋其實講緊呢一個格式轉換嗰度咧，其實都有需要係要有一個合約嘅凌駕性嘅條文嘅。不過可惜喺今次我哋連修訂嗰度都未有，將來我哋一定要處理。多謝主席。

578
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:22,760
冇猛情意。

579
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:30,670
contract override is not a term easily understood by many.

580
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:41,470
In a nutshell, it's about private contracts overriding legal protection, legal exemptions.

581
02:29:42,270 --> 02:29:44,210
And as a result.

582
02:29:44,490 --> 02:29:45,840
It's obvious.

583
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:51,470
Our proposed amendment by.

584
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:53,160
丹尼斯·科特。

585
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:56,360
It's essentially only one line.

586
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,450
That.

587
02:30:00,730 --> 02:30:14,500
一條約定是無力執行，到盡度它承諾阻止或限制任何行為，不會侵犯版權。

588
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:35,220
所以它非常 obvious，what this is all about，and some people would say，oh that's been argued，because the only jurisdiction in whole wide world is the UK，where there is such

589
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:39,930
exemption in the copyright laws.

590
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:48,420
但係，佢太新，佢非常爭議，所以我們應該等下再睇。

591
02:30:49,160 --> 02:31:05,240
另一個argument goes, even, even the United States hasn't got this kind of law because it's too arguable, it's too debatable. Now that's all perfectly understandable.

592
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:10,270
except，since when，we need to follow。

593
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:21,640
United States examples, or for that matter, the UK example. This is Hong Kong. This is 2016.

594
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:25,190
We're here at this legislature.

595
02:31:25,870 --> 02:31:32,990
to have new amended laws to help preserve our basic freedoms and.

596
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:45,000
Protect our population. A law is here to serve the people, not to restrict, to prohibit the people in any way.

597
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:48,030
unless it's perfectly illegal.

598
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:49,260
Sir。

599
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:56,820
some people would still say that because this concept about not allowing

600
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:17,110
私隱合同來override legal protection or exemptions in general is so new. Why couldn't we just wait? As a matter of fact, the government has actually promised they will review this copyright law in due course.

601
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:23,420
That brings us to another issue, and that is trust.

602
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:26,240
I'm sure everyone here.

603
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:40,060
Would agree that trust is a key factor, if not the most important factor, in politics. Now that bureau chief is going to say again, please do not.

604
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:55,980
politicise this issue, like he did with that HKTV licence application. But this is a political issue, of course. That's what we're doing here. What's the legislature supposed to be doing?

605
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,740
solving。

606
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,330
Politics.

607
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:02,610
problems， two， right。

608
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:10,260
How could you dispute that? The fact that he's actually got some political assistant in his office.

609
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,350
tells you that.

610
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:15,510
Every government policy.

611
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:17,820
係一個政治性嘅問題。

612
02:33:20,350 --> 02:33:27,490
香港不是民主社會，這不是美國，也不是英國。

613
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:43,030
We do not have a genuine political system. We do not trust this government. This amount of distrust is so abundant that everyone can see.

614
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:50,340
amongst the population, any outsiders coming to Hong Kong, could detest that sentiment.

615
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:56,350
If we need to follow Western.

616
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:59,990
doings on the legal front.

617
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:02,030
shall we not?

618
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:04,760
just see what the

619
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:08,410
The U.K. government has been doing.

620
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:12,450
Protect the people first.

621
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:19,450
and then we'll see what happens afterwards. Contract override.

622
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:27,070
It's obviously considered a good thing, and that's why they do it in the UK.

623
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:42,870
litigations or controversies followed, fine, we reveal it afterwards. But this Hong Kong government is trying to do it the other way round, and we do not trust they would actually reveal it to the.

624
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:45,670
the better, the greater good.

625
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:47,000
altogether.

626
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:53,370
Well, this trust business, when it comes to this copyright amendment bill.

627
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:54,890
has been a.

628
02:34:55,320 --> 02:35:15,330
exemplified by our chief secretary Carrie Lam. One day she would say, "Oh well, we might have to consider taking away, shelving this amendment bill first." The next, she would immediately refute herself.

629
02:35:15,330 --> 02:35:18,540
説：，That there's never been such a plan.

630
02:35:19,190 --> 02:35:35,930
And then our bureau chief will come back out and say, "Ah, well, we just might consider still." So what are you talking about? Artful rhetoric, right? My argument, Mr. President, is that.

631
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:40,670
this contract override issue.

632
02:35:41,950 --> 02:35:46,370
是 controversal，但for the better good。

633
02:35:46,710 --> 02:35:48,860
We should get it.

634
02:35:49,400 --> 02:36:05,110
included. This amendment should be accepted by the government first. Let's do the protection first. If there's any hole in it afterwards, we will review it as the government has promised.

635
02:36:05,630 --> 02:36:10,810
要，

636
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:15,140
在最尾一節，我們的委員會。

637
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:23,960
我 was, I I actually hesitated a bit over this particular amendment.

638
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:38,840
因為我問了很多問題，我得到回覆來自政府官員，負責説，可能我們應該對私營合約有更多尊重。

639
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:59,130
and I immediately could imagine if I were some writer, I'm a booker, I'm an author, right? and I had some contract with my publisher. I would have assumed that contract is between not just me and the publisher, but

640
02:36:59,130 --> 02:37:08,110
Also covers all my rights vis-à-vis the entire society, the entire outside world, would it not?

641
02:37:08,670 --> 02:37:20,230
If you have legal exemptions, that would maybe infringe infringe my rights as an author as well. So I was hesitating.

642
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:25,140
但係，我作為一個作者，如果我係，

643
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:26,350
as if

644
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:37,100
Vis-à-vis the entire population, the entire world, this internet age, this cyber world.

645
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:40,700
This 2016 era.

646
02:37:41,350 --> 02:37:42,740
我 think。

647
02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:44,390
maybe。

648
02:37:45,070 --> 02:37:48,950
greater good， should hold the upper hand。

649
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:51,610
但係，我我冇實際。

650
02:37:51,890 --> 02:37:54,400
Absolutely, made up my mind.

651
02:37:54,680 --> 02:38:03,180
at the time, I just thought let it get passed first. The Bills Committee would accept Denis Quock's amendment.

652
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:10,020
We do the better side of things first.

653
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:30,670
But it's very curious the chairman of our Bills Committee would now be the proposer of this amendment, and he's come out to speak so specifically that he's against it. Tells you a lot about the system of ours at this chamber.

654
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:33,340
或喺呢個 legislature。

655
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:38,050
which is copied after the U.K. model, by the way.

656
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:55,880
Talking about artful rhetorics, right? This government is also very good at telling everyone the three powers of society: the executive, the legislative and the judicial powers should perhaps cooperate.

657
02:38:56,600 --> 02:39:06,960
合作，係such a meaningful word。Why don't we just cooperate with the government when it comes to this particular amendment bill?

658
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:09,610
合作，ration， harmony。

659
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:15,680
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the chief secretary has actually come to you.

660
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:18,420
佢話。

661
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:22,200
as perceived, pressurise.

662
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:25,070
hopefully，this chamber。

663
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:28,040
this legislature to pass.

664
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:30,730
this unwanted bill.

665
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:51,170
As soon as possible. This is just not right. But I surely appreciate your apparent standing firm on the issue. I'll come back to this contract override thing. Yes, I've been talking about contract override all this time, sir.

666
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:56,490
因為佢哋係一班lier， and not very good liers。

667
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,790
嗯。

668
02:39:59,650 --> 02:40:09,100
Some people now, this is a debate, right? I'm replying, responding to some of the arguments previously put forward to.

669
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:14,500
That if you're so innovative, why don't you just

670
02:40:15,050 --> 02:40:35,060
do things on your own, do the designs on your own instead of copying others. Well, the person, correct me if I'm wrong. I got too much information. I may have been confused. I think is exactly the chairman of the bills committee telling this chamber that if you're so innovative.

671
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:38,060
don't be a copycat，that's what he said.

672
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:46,340
但他 certainly didn't know anything about Andy Warhol and his Campbell's soup designs.

673
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:54,160
Sir，what about I.M.Pei， the world renowned architect? He and his glassy pyramids.

674
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:56,140
outside Louvre。

675
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:58,010
the pyramids。

676
02:40:58,290 --> 02:41:00,070
啊， ancient。

677
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:01,800
埃及。

678
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:05,200
祖上遺址。

679
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:15,020
誰會 ever accuse I M P of copying the Egyptians and do a French artwork?

680
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:18,370
在法國首都，巴黎。

681
02:41:18,890 --> 02:41:21,300
那係我另一個點。

682
02:41:25,030 --> 02:41:27,020
and so as I was saying.

683
02:41:27,610 --> 02:41:29,180
誒，啲嘢 bills。

684
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:30,680
committee。

685
02:41:31,210 --> 02:41:34,410
We really haven't got much.

686
02:41:34,690 --> 02:41:46,660
Time much opportunity to talk about contract override in details because people either absent or they hear they shut up.

687
02:41:47,070 --> 02:42:07,080
或，他們簡直，不會 bother。他們認為，任何被政府否決的事，不會通過。所以，不重要我們的委員會是否同意，就讓它通過程序。

688
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:12,750
Things will get sorted out because they've got enough votes out there, right?

689
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:20,940
just let it drag through and it will pass. That's not right. That's not right at all.

690
02:42:21,220 --> 02:42:30,420
在 life， we always say， Mr. President， if there's a dilemma， what do we do？ We take the lesser evil。

691
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:36,200
但喺呢個case，係唔係較小嘅惡，係較大嘅好。

692
02:42:36,890 --> 02:42:38,850
保護先， first。

693
02:42:39,510 --> 02:42:41,490
Let's make sure.

694
02:42:41,890 --> 02:42:50,630
Hong Kong people are being protected to start with. You can't say this is not perfect.

695
02:42:50,910 --> 02:43:01,160
And so take it first. Let's find it acceptable first, and we'll better it afterwards. This is not the way to go.

696
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:02,620
因為。

697
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:11,950
We do not, as I was saying, trust this. I think the honourable member is repeating herself. No, I'm not repeating myself because.

698
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:32,390
This greater good business is most important in law or in the legal world. We have this saying: ignorance is no defence. You can't claim that we can't. The judge should have sympathy on someone who was.

699
02:43:32,390 --> 02:43:52,400
是Caught spitting in the street, spitting in public, because he didn't know is an offence in Hong Kong to spit in public. Right? Ignorance is no defence. But what if the general population just didn't know? If something I bought it says all rice.

700
02:43:52,400 --> 02:44:01,760
served and I thought I had some legal protection or some basic rights in this new world to disseminate.

701
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:04,760
to reuse some information.

702
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:10,410
But as a matter of fact, I didn't. I wasn't allowed, and I didn't know.

703
02:44:10,690 --> 02:44:14,910
我唔得get protected， and this is just not fair.

704
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:21,290
所以，我們需要至少去追尋公平，來開始。

705
02:44:21,690 --> 02:44:22,360
Thank you.

706
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:26,040
黃雍文議員。

707
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:29,060
主席。

708
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:41,030
本席根據議事規則第四十括弧四條，對《二零一四年版權修訂條例草案》全體委員會提出休會待續議案。
