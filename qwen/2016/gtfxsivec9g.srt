各位團體嚇，咁亦都歡迎政府官員。

亦都向可以向在場嘅立法會保安人士索取有關嘅誒，須知嘅。

5
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:29,080
間咧，我哋畀誒四分鐘。我哋而家首先請誒財資市場公會嘅張泰強先生，唔該你，張生。

6
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:11,680

7
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:13,060
都提醒各位參加聽證會嘅人士咧，除咗立法會議員及出席會議指定官員之外咧，出席今日會議嘅人士，其口頭陳述同埋書面咧，均不受《立法會權力及特權條例》所保障嘅。

8
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:39,040
係誒爭取時間咧，或者可以誒喺團體即係表達意見之後，我哋可以誒一並去回應。如果係誒誒仲有時間，我哋都可以去睇睇文件裏邊嘅一啲細節嘅。

9
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:42,800
啊，首先喺聽取團體嘅發言之前咧，我想就請政府就誒啱啱收到嗰份文件C.B.括弧四五三四十五下劃十六零一號文件，可唔可以簡單介紹你哋喺上就上次嘅問題嘅嘅嘅答覆先啦？唔？

10
00:02:44,060 --> 00:03:04,070
啊！多謝主席，係唔該各位委員。誒，我哋上次個文件咧係回應啊，有啊委員提出啦。啊，我哋過去就住條例草案同誒不同嘅界別同埋團體接觸嘅時候，收到嘅一啲意見啊，而同埋我哋嗰個睇法嘅。噉我。

11
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:24,080
相信誒，我哋喺文件裏邊誒誒表達咗嗰啲誒事情咧，可能同今日誒各位團體誒誒會表達嘅一啲意見咧，可能係誒有誒類似嘅地方，或者係會再次誒有個討論。咁誒，因此誒，如果係，

12
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
香港設立依啲財資中心啊，噉樣。

13
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,440
都好好頻密，咁股票市場更加係好一個好大嘅市場啦嚇。

14
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,990
再加埋嗰個本身嗰個基礎建設咧，好好穩健嘅嚇，咁整整體上即係呢個誒。

15
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:53,360
市場嘅對沖嘅用工具嘅使用啊，係充分令到香港能夠發揮到個財資市場嗰個中心點嘅角色嘅。

16
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:01,520
咁所以咧就依個誒誒喺未來嗰五至十年咧，誒師傅依個功能咧係越嚟越重要，依個第一點。

17
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:59,330
好好好，誒今日嘅誒聽取團體嘅嘅意見咧，我就想向各位即係介紹一下咧。如果你戴上耳筒嘅話咧，誒頻道零號咧就係現場嘅收音，頻道一號咧就係粵語，頻道二號就係英語，頻道三咧就係普通話嘅。我亦都。

18
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:33,350
誒，請各位團體代表留意喺立法會綜合大樓會議室出席會議或在公眾席旁聽會嘅公眾人士嘅須知中列出嘅各項保安措施。該須知以及在秘書處發給各位嘅函件之中，亦都放咗喺各位嘅枱面上邊。喺旁聽席同埋公眾席嘅人士。

19
00:04:40,260 --> 00:05:00,270
我亦都請個別團體代表咧啊，逐一發言。每位時間係四分鐘。發言時咧，只需指出意見書嘅重點，你唔使全個意見書讀嘅，而無需重複意見書嘅全部內容。根據慣常嘅做法咧，委員會已將收到嘅書面意見書咧上載喺立法會嘅網頁，亦都係分發咗畀我哋嘅位。

20
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:20,280
委員，嗱，倘若各位未有意見書或者尚有書面補充嘅意見咧，歡迎喺會喺呢個會之後提供。此外，各位喺發言時咧，唔好中英夾雜，即係話你可以用中文或者用英文，以免咧我哋嘅翻譯嘅同事咧引致啲不便嘅。咁誒，每位團誒每個團體嘅時。

21
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:51,160
誒，OK，多謝畀我機會發展發表嘅意見嚇。誒，財資上咧，其實我哋都喺依個誒誒依個企業財資中心嘅發展裏面，都要係一個好好重要嘅誒睇法嚇。因為我哋知道咧，就依個商業財資中心咧，其實好似一間誒機構裏邊嘅內部銀行啦，可。

22
00:05:51,160 --> 00:06:11,170
可以促進咧佢內部資金嘅調配啦，即係喺可能甲公司有多餘嘅資金，乙公司少咗，可以互互相去去調配下。咁呢個係誒呢個好重要嘅一個其中一個一個功能嚟嘅嚇，更加係可以將一啲誒流動性嘅管理係更加有效率啦嚇。咁有時如果需要誒將啲錢去去。

23
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:31,180
某某個供應商啊，要付款啊，咁呢個都係喺喺個集中處理，係好有考慮嘅。同埋有時如果需要去籌集資金嘅話咧，咁呢個都係一個一個一個中心點去去處理樣嘢。所以呢個好處好明顯嘅嚇。咁所以誒，我咧就呢個好重要啦嚇。噉我哋都誒睇過香港個軟軟件啊、硬件。

24
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:51,190
方面喺呢方面嘅配合，其實香港喺嗰方面其實誒作為一個國際金融中心咧，其實配合其實都好好嚇誒，包括我咁大家知道銀行係好充裕誒，各類銀行都喺度可以誒服務緊香港嘅市民嚇咁誒資金亦都係流動性好好嘅嚇噉啊個外匯市場嘅加入。

25
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:23,280
誒呢個監管局啊，都喺呢方面嘅嘅嘅設計咧，都係其實都好完善嘅嚇。咁誒更加唔使誒去去去再重複就話呢個誒，譬如喺喺會計方面啊，喺法律方面啊，都好完備啦嚇。咁但係我哋當誒同啲行家去傾下點解啊？點解嚟唔嚟？

26
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:46,130
其實最終講嚟講去，撈尾可能都會有一點就話：，咦，個税務可能係有啲有啲誒困難，即係嚟講唔係好誒好有優勢嚇。咁誒更加係如果同鄰近一啲地方，可能係一個相對相對係劣勢添嚇。咁所以喺

27
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,100
正如啊，頭先啊啊啊啊誒！

28
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,380
With associated corporations, we submit that this should be clearly defined.

29
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,010
呢幾個地方噉，香港喺方面咧的的確確係一個背腳石。

30
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,360
所以咧，佢哋都對香港依個財資市場中心依個政策咧，係非常歡迎。

31
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:21,600
Group financing business， we believe the definition of of intragroup financing business is unclear and uncertainty exists.

32
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:35,260
If it is not possible to improve the clarity of the meaning of integral financing business in the bill, we suggest the committee urge the LD to issue a practice note on this matter shortly after the bill is enacted.

33
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:52,410
It is uncertain whether a company who lends to group companies, but with no or little borrowing from associated corporations, will be considered as carrying an intra-group financing business and hence qualified as a CTC.

34
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:38,000
We illustrate the importance of the issue with two examples. First, in some countries, for example Germany, income derived from any group internal financing would be would be caught under the German CFC rules. So a proposed CFC or CTC may wish to be funded by third party debts.

35
00:07:46,130 --> 00:08:06,140
呢度發現呢個問題之後，我哋就一二年，我哋成立嗰個誒工作小組去研究呢個問題點去處理呢個問題噉，所以就終於就係我哋都覺得啊，其實喺喺税務方面咧，其實要處理嘅咁內容，我唔我唔，大家都清楚，我唔我唔再再重複一樣嘢啦。嚇噉，所以我覺得誒解決埋。

36
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:26,150
喺個即係我哋覺得係一個重要嘅一個一個一個困難咧，應該係對於個商業財務中心嘅發展應該好有幫助。噉啊，唔單止係誒公司啦，我諗喺銀行方當然都係好有幫助，因為其實銀行係亦都係配合公司嘅需要，喺無論係外匯啊、喺集資方面啊、喺

37
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:46,160
嗰樣嘢都係，其實都係一個好配合嘅噉，所以我諗對於整體嘅誒金融中心嘅發展係一個好重要嘅嘅過程裏邊咯。咁再有一點就係話年青人嘅工作機會咧。我諗如果誒將來好多誒公司喺度切入呢啲財資中心，或者係地區嘅誒總部咧，咁對於年青人嘅將來嘅就業機會咧，係一個。

38
00:08:46,160 --> 00:09:06,170
個好好嘅誒機會畀佢哋咯，咁呢個係未來係五年、十年一個喺嚟講係一個重要嘅發展，我覺得誒好應該我哋去支持樣嘢。我發現係咁多。好，唔該曬張生，下一位係誒國際企業財資中國協會主席黃偉文先生，黃生唔該你。好多謝咁多位。誒，作為國際財資。

39
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:26,180
中國協會企誒企業協會嘅主席會長啦，噉我誒擁有二十至三十年嘅誒財資方面嘅經驗，噉我係今日係代表業界咧係發表對呢個啊政策嘅一啲睇法嘅。咁誒，首先我誒都喺倫敦啊、紐約啊、香港啲作為呢個金融中心，都比較過誒各自嘅優。

40
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:46,190
好使啦，咁喺個誒誒睇到咧，就係話喺依個財資管理喺Churchmanagement，即係依個誒依個師傅嘅角色嚟講咧，喺亞洲或者誒依個大中華區咧，依十五年嚟咧係誒依個不斷噉樣係上升嘅。咁誒譬如話喺公司發嘅企業債券啊，喺個財資。

41
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:21,810
第二點咧，我哋業界覺得咧，就係話係推行呢個財資市財資誒企業財資中心呢個政策咧，除咗係會誒令香港嘅金融嘅法規咧與時並進，消除咗公司內部資金調配嘅不合理税務成本之外咧，更加咧係強調咧呢個誒。

42
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:41,820
誒公司對於集中管理財資風險、融資投資方面嘅重要性，所以咧，我哋咧就係喺方面咧，覺得係非常之重要嘅一個環節嚟嘅。噉我哋喺誒依個國際領域同依個國際嘅誒，譬如一個誒國際一啲財資協會嘅代表啦啊，或者國內嘅誒。

43
00:10:41,820 --> 00:11:01,830
即係一啲誒的中資嘅企業，包括民企、誒國企都有談過呢個問題。咁發覺咧，就佢哋其實喺誒當我哋選擇一個誒呢個誒誒誒跨國性質嘅財富中心咧，考慮嘅嘅點裏邊咧，佢會考慮譬如荷蘭啊、嗱盧森堡啊、誒或者新加坡啊、誒嗰啲。

44
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:35,420
誒誒，位講者講咗啦，啊，二零一二年開始咧，我已經加入咗呢個誒工作小組。咁喺呢幾年誒四五年裏之間咧，其實咧誒，通過我哋協會同埋呢個誒財資小協會嘅合作咧，我哋已經係啊充分噉樣誒，即係反映到業界嘅一啲誒即係建議，而呢個政策咧亦都充分誒。

45
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:55,430
反映到呢個建議，誒亦都係對香港將來個發展係非常之正面嘅嚇。咁所以咧，我覺得依個誒即係政策咧係值得我業界嘅支持嚇，同埋誒依個將來推行嘅嚇。多謝大家。好，唔該曬你，黃生。下一位係啊德勤會計師樓嘅合夥人殷國偉先生，唔該。誒，thank you。

46
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,080
多謝。

47
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,280
主席和成員，感謝您們對委員會的邀請。

48
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,700
我們已經有個一般反避税條款，第61A。

49
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,490
和facilitates Hong Kong's banks compliance with the relevant Basel III requirements to strengthen their capital positions.

50
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:04,400
create asymmetry tax treatment and to attract non-Hong Kong enterprises to set up CTCs in Hong Kong.

51
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,010
ACTC may enjoy half the normal tax rate only if the income derived relates to a non-Hong Kong associate corporation.

52
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:49,720
The bill has been generally well received by the industry, as it brings Hong Kong banks to a level playing field vis-à-vis their peers in other international finance centres.

53
00:14:50,980 --> 00:15:01,710
The language in section sixteen two C C, the main or one of the main purposes, has a wider application than the language in section sixty one A, the sole or dominant purpose.

54
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:25,320
The last point is on non-Hong Kong associated corporation, which is defined to mean an associated corporation which does not carry on any trade, profession or business in Hong Kong.

55
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:30,280
We do not see the need to, at the same time, introduce a taxing provision. There is already a well-established general principle to determine the source of interest income under the operations test.

56
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:13,860
We do not agree that the interest expense deductions proposed by the bill should be subject to a stricter anti-avoidance test than any other transactions which are subject to Section 61A.

57
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:18,140
The introduction of the deeming provision on interest income may discourage non-Hong Kong enterprises from setting up operations in Hong Kong. The bill is to deal with the unfair treatments on interest expense deduction.

58
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:46,520
Number three, the main or one of the main purposes, under Section 162C, interest expense deduction will be denied if the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the borrowing of the money is to avoid, postpone or reduce profit tax.

59
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:15,440
主席，我係David Yuen of Deloitte。We have sent in our written comments on the bill. We also wish to present the following views. Firstly, say that the definition of inter-group financing business, inter-group financing business in relation to a corporation is defined to mean the business of borrowing of money from and lending of money to.

60
00:12:52,700 --> 00:13:12,710
第二，where a company is funded by equity with no borrowing from associated corporations or third party, and lends the funds to associated corporations, there is a concern that the deeming provision, section 151IA, would apply on its interest income if it is regarded as carrying an interest

61
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:56,150
Number two is on dimming provisions on interest income. For the dimming provision on interest income, section 151IA, we consider it not necessary and unjustified. The bill is to provide relaxation of interest expense deduction by amending our existing rules, which in some situations.

62
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:54,340
因為根據非香港附屬公司的定義，當CTC收入與海外集團公司有關，而該集團公司透過在香港設立分部進行香港業務，此CTC收入不能享受優惠税率，即使該交易與海外集團公司無任何關係。

63
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:14,350
business in Hong Kong. This is not necessary, and we propose that the preferential tax rate should apply to income relating to an associate corporation, not in connection with any business carried on in Hong Kong by that associate associate corporation. And we hope the committee will consider our submission. Thank you. 下一位香港銀行公會嘅Mr. Dale Miller，唔該。

64
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:39,570
香港銀行協會會表達其對政府推動該法案的感謝，以應對業界要求釐清溢利税及印花税對由銀行發行的附加Tier 1及Tier 2規範資本證券的處理。

65
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,960
Next.

66
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,690
阿個 bank。

67
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,140
firstly.

68
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,240
第二。

69
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,610
協會要求第十七A、二、B、C和三。

70
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:31,250
The limitation in the current definition of security in the bill, such as convertibility into common equity and discretion.

71
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,930
為避免未attended result，協會請求第17F條被修改，以容許按月扣除利息。

72
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:05,610
被移除，such that RCSs for the purpose of the bill include all the Basel III compliant 81 and 82 instruments.

73
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:43,020
但係，因為一個未登記的公眾，一小部分的RCS是被指定的連接人，以他們的職能作為一個承保人。

74
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:21,450
然而，協會有幾項具體的關切，關於現時草擬的法案，以及要求修改或澄清，是在以下情況下。

75
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:32,750
This could happen, for instance, where RCS issued by a bank is either directly or indirectly funded by externally issued regulatory capital securities to the market.

76
00:18:52,210 --> 00:19:05,060
到達extent，that the RCS issued to connected parties are directly or indirectly funded by externally issued regulatory capital securities and not held for the benefit of specified connected persons.

77
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:10,700
協會因此支持該法案，就規管資產證券而言，將AT1和AT2工具視為債務，將 coupon 當作利息，用於利得税和印花税目的。

78
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:21,980
The current drafting of Section 17F may result in full disallowance of interest deduction where only a small portion of any regulatory capital security is held by a connected party for genuine commercial purpose.

79
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:24,360
In order to facilitate orderly resolution for banks and to protect other banks' creditors' interests, regulators, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, may require issuance of regulatory capital securities through financial service holding companies.

80
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:50,670
for the issuer to make distributions are not consistent with the qualifying criteria for 81 and 82 under the Basel III regulatory requirements, and therefore may exclude the applicability of the debt-like tax treatment to certain bona fide issuances of regulatory capital securities.

81
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,780
DC regime.

82
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,730
of the current bill.

83
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,590
comments or suggestions to the current draft bills.

84
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,180
啊！下一位特許公認會計師公會嘅黃建華先生，唔該您。

85
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:35,690
these these would not be a financial institution for the purpose of the inland revenue ordinance and hence will not be eligible to claim interest deduction pursuant to the bill.

86
00:19:49,940 --> 00:20:01,970
Section 17G seeks to introduce the OECD developments, separate legal entity and profits attribution principles, to Hong Kong branch of overseas banks issuing RCSs.

87
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:14,520
this is a significant change and a move away from Hong Kong's current source-based principles, which may also result in inconsistent treatment between Hong Kong incorporated banks and Hong Kong branches of non-resident banks.

88
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:48,750
而利息收入收到會被徵税，給 rise 到非對稱税待遇。協會要求法案覆蓋 RCS 發出由金融服務控股公司，因應監管要求。

89
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:07,140
If this is not the legislative intent, the association requests the drafting to be amended as appropriate. Otherwise, the association would request 17H to be removed from the bill until more comprehensive consultation has taken place. Okay, thank you.

90
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:31,290
這些是複雜原則，which require careful deliberation on practical application. The association therefore requests section 17G to be removed from the bill and defer the introduction after more comprehensive consultation with the industry. Finally, and apologies for overrunning.

91
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:51,580
section 17H has currently drafted can possibly be interpreted to codify the OECD separate legal entity profits attribution and transfer pricing principles into the domestic legislation and extend the application to all non-FI and non-RCS issuing taxpayers, which clearly falls outside the.

92
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:32,470
Thanks everyone. I'm Kenneth Wong representing ACCA. Firstly, I think ACCA fully welcome and support the introduction of the CTC regime, and to allow the flexibility and practicality and also the attractiveness of the CTC regime, we have three key

93
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:55,900
although some of them have already covered by some of the representators, but I think they are important, so I reiterate them. Firstly, I think for the draft 14D subsection two, there are certain restriction on a corporation or standalone entity to enjoy the.

94
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:17,070
practically, I think a lot of headquarters they have more functions than CTC, and if they have other functions like regional support functions, although now you have introduced one safe harbour rules which is around seventy five percent, and I think from a practical viewpoint.

95
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:37,080
Quite a number of headquarters may not be able to enjoy this CTC regime, so our suggestion is to relax or even remove these requirements to allow some headquarters to simply set aside its business unit to separately account for the CTC function which qualified.

96
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:57,110
under the qualification of the CTC activities, the interest income and expenses derived from that specific BU will be able to enjoy the CTC function. We believe this will largely increase the practicality and also the application of this CTC regime to.

97
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,810
sixteen two G。

98
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,970
finally，is on the interest deduction。

99
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,770
second is relating to the dimming pollution。

100
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,160
等我哋有多啲時間去討論同理解點樣去實行呢個十七G。

101
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,020
Lot of MNC setting up CDC and regional quarters in in Hong Kong.

102
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,340
maybe caught by this event, so we believe this dimming provision is not necessary.

103
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:53,240
Allowed up to the lower rate between the two, so that's the three key recommendation from us. Thank you.跟住係亞洲資本市場税務委員會嘅張延浩先生，張生唔該。

104
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:08,070
係，我首先想感謝委員會邀請我啊代表亞洲資本市場税務委員會嚟發言。啊，較早前咧，我哋CMTC就今日嘅草案咧已經提交咗意見書啦。

105
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:27,100
Section Fifteen One Subsection I A and Subsection L A， we believe that this steaming provision is not necessary， because I think the already proposed new provision under Section Fourteen have already give the sufficient taxing capacity.

106
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:47,110
for the CTC regime, introducing this diming provision will actually give some ambiguity in the test law, which in in the old days when or the current legislation for the non-CTC type of intercompany borrowing and lending.

107
00:23:47,110 --> 00:24:07,120
currently we rely on the provision of credit tax, which some of the interest income is able to enjoy offshore claim and not taxable in Hong Kong. But with the introduction of this new proposed provision 151IA and LA, those non CTC intercompany borrowing and lending.

108
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:40,100
There is a requirement for the recipient of the interest income at the other side before the Hong Kong CTC able to allow the get the interest deduction. For the recipient, there is a requirement that the interest income should be subject to tax and un.

109
00:24:40,100 --> 00:25:00,110
Under the definition of the proposed bill, the definition of subject to tax there is a clause saying that the tax has been paid or will be paid. We believe this criteria is practically quite difficult and not too practical. For example, if the other side is a lost company, then it's quite hard.

110
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:20,120
to wait until when it will be paid. Also, it will be make the whole legislation a little bit hard to apply. So we believe that this cost should be removed. And also the recipient side, there is a restriction that the the tax rate should be not lower than the.

111
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:40,130
effective tax rate in Hong Kong that the interest expense is allowed enjoying the deduction, i.e. 16.5 or 8.25. We believe that there should be some relaxation on this at least if the other side the tax rate is lower than in Hong Kong, the the interest deduction will be.

112
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,760
複雜嘅。

113
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,120
如果條例一旦通過，

114
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,620
佢哋喺税處啊嚟處理。

115
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,890
講清楚呢啲條例實際係點樣去操作。

116
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,710
同大家業業行啊，銀行業界去討論。

117
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,420
我C.S.L就啊有呢啲噉嘅案例嘅，但係佢哋冇一個類似十七G嘅。

118
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:40,160
如果唔清晰嘅話咧，啊，會令到啲納税人同埋税務局產生不必要嘅爭議嘅。

119
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:01,550
出全部放曬喺香港嘅分行嚟嘅扣税，換言之咧，十七G係一種反避税嘅條文嚟嘅。

120
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:52,910
嗱，香港嘅税制咧就有簡單嘅優點嘅，仲有一個獨特性就係有呢個來源地嘅概念個source concept啦。

121
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:53,600
嗱，但係未未有啊業界個共識嘅話，就算通過之後，税務局出嘅執行指引咧，到時候都會有好多爭議嘅。

122
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:04,350
我哋可以參考翻外國點樣去處理RCS類似RCS啊，式扣税嘅啊方法啦，睇睇啊新加坡。

123
00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:04,380
即係如果收入係非來源於香港嘅咧，就通常就唔需要畀香港税嘅。咁呢個來源啊嘅概念點樣同十七G配合咧？

124
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:28,390
喺草案不同唔同嘅地方咧，都提出咗唔同嘅想法。所以今日嘅時間，發現時間有限啦。我淨係想從重點講清楚草案嘅第三部分，關於啊監管資本證券RCS税務處理嘅十七G條。我哋嘅要求咧係想抽起十七G。

125
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:53,590
誒喺第一次嘅草案會議當中咧，啲議員都有問過十七G係咩用途嘅。政府嘅回答咧就係因為而家嘅草案咧係畀啲RCS嘅利息支出可以扣税，所以十七G嘅用途咧就要限制啲外國總行將RCS嘅利息支。

126
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:21,840
但係誒，政府而家想引入呢個啊十七G，唔係就係咁簡單，係啊利息扣税嘅問題嘅啫。佢仲係會引入一啲全新嘅啊概念嘅，例如將一間外國銀行嘅香港分行被視為一家完全獨立企業，又會假設分行。

127
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:41,850
擁有自己嘅股權啦，同埋借貸資本，並且需要對分行嘅職能啊、啊資產同承擔風險能力作出各種各樣嘅假設嘅呢啲要求咧，係啊對而家畀香港金管局對於香港分行嘅監管規定咧，係更加。

128
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:24,810
而家啊，係咪所有來源自香港以外嘅收入，根據十七G都要畀税咧？咁呢啲噉嘅問題就係其他啊，十七G帶出嘅問題，譬如啊，一間香港分行同埋本地銀行嘅處理方法會唔同嘅？我哋就需要啲充分嘅時間去同税務局。

129
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,990
去誒。

130
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,060
作出嘅限制嘅。

131
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:25,660
日本咧就花咗三年多嘅時間去商討同樣次十七G嘅議案，而澳洲咧就更加係由一三年開始討論到而家都未完成。

132
00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:05,070
咁雖然十七G係全啊嘅全獨立企業原則咧，都係由中啊經合組織啊O E C D度嚟嘅，而我哋咧都會絕對同意香港税例咧係遲早要實行啲O E C D提出嘅方方案。

133
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:46,480
咁另外咧，十七G同十七A至十七F係冇乜大關係嘅。啊，其他所有嘅反避税條例，譬如十七E啊同十七F都喺度啦。而且而家的税例，譬如十六括二、六十一同六十一A，都可以對利息扣税同避税。

134
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:25,360
但係啊，要做多啲充分嘅誒諮詢同討論啊。之前嘅諮詢同討論喺十七G呢方面咧，就比較短嘅時間嘅咧。所以同埋之前提出嘅意見咧，都未被接納。所以我哋係要求抽起就呢個十七G，等我哋有更更多時間去討論同瞭解。

135
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:45,370
係點樣去實行？多謝曬。好，下一位企業師傅工會嘅何志文先生係多謝主席。誒，主席各位委員，我係代表香港誒企業師傅協會發言嘅。誒，首先多謝誒立法會邀請我今次發表意見。誒，我哋協會會員係包括香港土生土長或。

136
00:30:45,370 --> 00:31:05,380
或者係外來香港投資嘅誒大同埋中型嘅公司，呢啲公司有一個共同之處就係我哋都係誒個會員，每日都會係處理唔同性質誒、唔同誒數量嘅誒財資或者師傅業務。噉我哋個會咧係非常支持誒政府今次嘅努力同埋佢哋嘅啊啊。

137
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:25,390
方向去優化香港嘅誒誒誒金融嘅地位，吸引更加多嘅誒本土或者係外國企業，將誒佢哋嘅誒師傅嘅業務集中喺香港，成為一個地區或者國際嘅誒中心嘅。誒，我哋喺

138
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:45,400
唔同方面咧，亦都睇到誒依個所謂財資或者師傅嘅行業嘅重要性，日漸提提高。第一就係話，隨住國際化嘅誒誒提誒增長，誒每一家公司喺誒海外投資嘅機會多咗，咁變咗喺點樣處理？唔單止係誒集資誒。

139
00:31:45,400 --> 00:32:05,410
誒誒或誒，甚至乎係全球嘅資金集中管理誒誒，同埋呢個管理係外匯風險誒，或者係應對唔同金融誒市場嘅變化嘅時候咧，佢哋實實係需要有一個誒集中嘅辦公室或者集中嘅地方。

140
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,460
原則。

141
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,550
叫做。

142
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,220
嗯， in particular， the proposals contain a restrictive condition that.

143
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:16,260
然而，有啲區域，我們相信修訂應該作出到法案，以確保政府嘅目標會被達成。

144
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:20,470
overseas tax has been paid or will be paid by the overseas recipients companies. We can we recommend that the office the

145
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:51,780
This could be achieved, for example, by excluding dividend income and investment in subsidiaries from the profits and asset tests under the relevant safeguard rules of the bill.

146
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:41,130
We therefore recommend the definition of a qualifying CTC in the legislation be amended to cover a genuine CTC which also acts as a holding company.

147
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:32,040
the the conditions that officers has to be paid should be changed from should should be changed to the simple a simple subject to test requirement.

148
00:35:52,170 --> 00:36:04,660
Secondly, the provisions allowing the deduction on interest paid by CTC to overseas group companies, as proposed in the bill, are currently too restrictive.

149
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:29,910
In respect of CTC proposals, we consider that the scope of the concessionary test rate will exclude Bona Five CTC, which also serve as a group holding company.

150
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:13,180
Development interest income of a corporation is non-taxable under the so-called operation test. The corresponding interest expense would be disallowed, regardless of the proposed relaxation of the interest deduction rule under the proposed section sixteen two G of the bill.

151
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:25,420
去處理依啲誒誒越嚟越重要嘅誒事務嘅，噉我哋亦都見到喺過去十年或者更加長嘅時間咧，誒地區嘅國家包括新加坡、馬來西亞等地咧，都有佢哋本身推出嘅政策咧，去吸引誒跨國公司，特別係大公司或者係中型嘅企業。

152
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:45,430
去佢哋地方設立係財資中心。誒，我哋覺得政府依一個誒誒誒誒誒提議咧，係會更加強化香港作為誒地區或者國際財資市場金誒中心嘅，會有一個好大嘅誒誒誒動力。咁

153
00:32:45,430 --> 00:33:05,440
我哋嘅會員由於都係喺香港成立咗一段相當多時間，誒包括百幾年歷史嘅公司，咁所以站喺我哋嚟到講咧，如果係完全喺短期內誒調整自己，去單獨去誒改變公司嘅架構或者商業嘅運作模式。

154
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:27,410
達到依一個誒誒税務嘅誒誒條例嘅優優勢咧，未必可以即時做到。咁但係我哋亦都會配合市場嘅誒發展，去盡量自己睇翻自己嘅商業嘅情況，去誒安排翻誒最理想嘅財資嘅誒誒運作模式。

155
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:47,570
噉，但係雖然係噉，我哋亦都睇到政府今次嘅努力同埋今次嘅動議咧，係會係更加強化香港作為國際誒金融或者係依個誒財務管理中心嘅地位嘅誒。點解咧？第一誒會吸引誒更加多嘅公司誒。

156
00:33:47,570 --> 00:34:07,580
啊！考慮將依個誒業務集中喺香港，因為喺依個動議如果可以得到立法會通過之後咧，香港喺各方面嘅財務嘅安排嘅優勢咧，會同誒其他周邊嘅國家拉近。咁同時會造成一個凝聚力咧，就係誒會將更加多。

157
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:27,590
嘅啊，財資嘅業務嘅交易咧，帶嚟香港變咗周邊配套嘅舉例嚟講，銀行、誒法律、會計啊，或者係誒誒誒文件處理、信息處理嘅行業咧，都係隨住依個誒誒誒動作咧，而家。

158
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:47,600
大噉，亦都可以對整體香港嘅發展，誒香港金融中心嘅地位得到進一步鞏固嘅。噉就我最後呼籲咧，誒亦都政府繼續誒留意周邊市場嘅發展，可以將誒而家建議嘅安排咧更加優化，等更加多誒香港。

159
00:34:47,600 --> 00:35:07,610
或者係誒誒其他嘅公司咧，誒把握到呢個機會，誒將佢哋業務、財資嘅業務、誒管理嘅模式帶嚟香港，等香港更上一層樓。多謝大家。安永税務諮詢有限公司啊，康樹榮先生，康生，thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I sincerely support the overall objective of the bill.

160
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,410
實猖狂辦著。

161
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,120
However, this proposed app.

162
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,890
sell essentially a simple loan of money.

163
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,440
relevant associates of the insurance FI in all circumstances.

164
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,960
留意你個submission，因為我都畀多咗一分鐘。噉我而家請誒。

165
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,540
in this regard, we propose that the disallowance should be proportional to the amount of LCS that are held by

166
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:24,890
香港版《條例》的投資人誒費，requires further and wider discussions under a separate consultation exercise.

167
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:48,710
as such, these two dim provisions have the potential of driving away such financing activities from Hong Kong, which would not be good for the general economy of Hong Kong.

168
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:57,470
Proposed set of resource rules of the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed may not necessarily align with the source principles and rules developed by the court over the over the years.

169
00:37:49,010 --> 00:38:02,900
Furthermore, these two dimin provisions may also be said to be discriminatory, in the sense that they only apply to an intra-group financing basis of a corporation, but not to a long intra-group financing basis.

170
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:42,520
啊，specifically section seventeen, section seventeen D provided the chargeable profits of such Hong Kong bond of a non-resident FI have to be ascertained, taking into account the functions performed, asset used and risks assumed by the non-resident FI.

171
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:16,590
In regard啊，to Long Bam Holding Company，嗯，我稍等，我要，我稍等，我稍，你你嗰個喺呢個呢個廳喺度，係，誒，我哋睇到你個submission嘅啦，噉我我諗我哋就我會誒再。

172
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:55,730
Thirdly， the two deemed provisions， debt deemed interest income and profits from certain test instruments to be testable are unnecessary and cannot be justified by the proposed relaxations of the interest deduction rule. This is because it based on the current test law case law.

173
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:35,220
Specifically, the introduction of these two new provisions could send a warm message that taxpayers would no longer be able to rely on the provision of credit tests to claim their interest as being non-taxable offshore income, even where the interbank financing activities involved do not amount to a business or the lending involved.

174
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:25,000
而啊，in respect of RCS， our views are as follows. Section seventeen D of the bill, which proposed to treat the Hong Kong branch of a non-Western FI as an enterprise separate and distinct from other parts of the FI, could potentially fundamentally change the source rule for profits derived by.

175
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:17,870
as such, this may lead to the undesirable result that there is a one set of statutory source rule for Hong Kong boundaries of non-Western SIFs under Section Seventeen Seventeen G and a different set of case law based source rules for Western SIFs. We believe such potential fundamental change to the basis of taxation for

176
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:49,540
有將呢啲條文咧，同有關嘅團體同埋界別嘅人士去分享，同埋吸留佢哋啲意見。

177
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:46,330
第二，section 17F of the bill seeks to disallow distributions of outs on RCS in full in certain situations where the funds are not entirely transferable to an external use. Can you finish it within 15 seconds? We consider this all or nothing approach is too restrictive.

178
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:42,250
政府咧就團體嘅意見作出一個簡單回應，兼且咧就順便介紹埋誒零一號嘅文件。阿殷女士先啦，唔該。好啊，多謝主席。或者我先就誒團體同埋誒議會人士剛才發表嘅意見咧，誒作出一啲誒。

179
00:40:42,250 --> 00:41:02,260
總體嘅回應，然之後我請阿廖俊傑先生同埋啊，税務局嘅副局長咧，可能係對於誒其中一啲誒誒要點咧誒係特別喺我哋文件誒有足及嘅要點咧，就作出補充嘅。誒，我想作出幾點誒總體嘅回應咧。第

180
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:22,270
第一就係好多謝各位團體今日發表嘅意見。誒，我聽到嘅意見咧，誒，亦都係同我哋以往一啲誒收到嘅意見係一致。特別係咧，誒，今天我相信所有團體都係支持我哋條例草案裏邊有兩個主要項目嘅建議。第一個就係話喺個税務

181
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:42,280
處理上面咧，可以便利到我哋嘅財資企業財資中心喺香港嘅設立。呢個就包括喺利息支出上面咧，可以作出税務扣減啦。同埋，如果係喺香港設立財資中心咧，能夠有減半嘅一個利誒利得税嘅一個括誒減半嘅處理嘅。

182
00:41:42,280 --> 00:42:02,290
咁另外一個誒範疇咧，就係關於喺銀行佢為咗去啊符合呢個巴塞爾三嗰個要求，如果發出一啲係所謂監管資本證券嘅時候咧，我哋亦都係建議咧係能夠喺將佢當作作呢啲債券利息嘅處理嚇。

183
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:22,300
可以喺作出誒税務方面嘅扣減，包括印花税嘅扣減噉樣樣。因此我聽到係一啲誒誒支持嘅建議。誒當然誒我哋亦都係承認咧，喺呢一兩個大範疇所牽涉嘅種種嘅技術嘅層面，以致概念嘅層面係唔係簡單嘅。

184
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:42,310
事物嚟嘅，亦都唔係簡單嘅事情。誒，正如亦都有誒業界人士剛才提到啦。誒，以往誒亦都有業界不斷有同我哋反映喺税務上面係我可以作出一啲處理。誒，我哋亦都係收到呢啲意見，但係唔係一時一刻我即刻可以。

185
00:42:42,310 --> 00:43:02,320
回應得到就係因因為當中牽涉税務嗰個處理嘅複雜性。今天我哋經過係過往年多以嚟咧非常密集嘅一種嘅諮詢嘅方式，就包括兩啊輪嘅一方面係誒首次嚟講，我哋係作出一啲概念性嘅諮詢諮詢。

186
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:26,330
係誒寬減咗一半嘅，咁所以誒呢個係絕對係提供咗一個好大嘅誘因啦。

187
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:59,290
流嘅價值，否則咧係成套嗰個嘅誒優惠嘅措施咧，未必係可以完滿噉樣樣咧，係達到佢有關嘅政策目的嘅。

188
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:22,490
咁剛才有好多即係財資工會啊，或者其他嘅界別人士，我哋都有誒唔同嘅接觸。希望喺概念上認為係可行嘅時候咧，我哋去去作出內部嘅一個功夫去工作咧，去做出統籌去誒誒去推行呢件事情。

189
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:42,500
咁誒喺概念上確立佢係可行嘅時候咧，我哋就第二個階段咧就係進入一個草擬嘅法例嘅工作。呢個亦都我哋亦都係誒請咗我哋嘅律政司個誒法律草擬專員嘅同事幫我哋一齊起草。而當我哋有主體嗰個條文嘅時候咧，我哋亦都啊有。

190
00:43:49,820 --> 00:44:09,830
嗯，或者我喺呢度講講誒，剛才有好多誒，其實誒，無論喺我哋過去一年嗰個啲密集式嘅諮詢當中，或者係剛才團體誒發表嘅意見咧，其實都係非常之有用。我哋喺誒適當嘅時候，亦都係吸吸納咗咁誒。但係點解都係有？

191
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:29,840
好誒唔同嘅意見咧，噉樣樣誒。當然，我哋誒主體嗰個目的啊，一個誒目標，呢兩個主誒嗰個建議都係一種所謂推動市場或者便利市場嘅舉舉措，即係話所謂market facilitation嘅舉措誒。如果可以做到好便捷。

192
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:49,850
誒冇要求，呢個係最最好、最理想嘅一個方式。咁但係同時間，我哋必須要顧及咧喺推行市場便利嘅措施嘅同時咧，誒亦都要諗到會唔會誒被濫用啊？誒而個事實上唔單止睇翻香港嗰個情況，誒。

193
00:44:49,850 --> 00:45:09,860
如果香港情況一般嚟講，大家係用税務條例下邊嘅所謂嘅general嗰啲anti-tax provision，即係一般嘅所謂反避税嘅條文。但係因為我哋今天講嗰啲誒幾種嘅誒建議咧，係比較好技術性，亦都好專門，因此我哋需要一啲專門嘅反避税嘅嘅。

194
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:29,870
措施噉，同時結合咗國際嘅要求，所以誒，我哋即係一般誒背後嘅考慮係噉樣樣。咁誒，其餘誒當然啦。誒團體喺今天誒或者誒喺文件上面發表嘅意見咧，我哋都會繼續去考慮。特別喺行文嘅時候，我哋。

195
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:49,880
亦都係誒留心咧，我哋即使係有一啲建議、有啲要求，我哋都希望喺行文上做到咧，淨係規範喺我哋今天所講嘅題目上面，即係話誒企業財資同埋嗰個誒監管證券誒嗰個誒誒資本證券嗰。

196
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:09,890
而希望佢唔會影響到其他税務嗰個條例嗰個嗰個運作。咁或者喺呢幾點之下咧，我誒請阿廖俊傑先生去講一講我哋個文件觸及嗰啲要點嚇。誒都係剛才誒有議會人士講嘅啲問題。好啊，廖生唔該。啊，多謝主席。啊，首先亦都多謝。

197
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:29,900
咧誒，今日咁多位出席嘅團體嘅代表咧，喺其實過去嗰一兩年咧時間，都畀咗好多唔同嘅意見。我哋，我哋亦都咧，盡可能好似正話，殷小姐所講咧，係吸納咗好多嘅意見。咁剩翻落嚟嘅一啲嘅誒技術性嘅誒提議或者係意見咧，誒我哋。

198
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:49,910
誒係細心去衡量過，誒誒誒，即係曾經聽過嘅意見咧，係先至落實咧呢個條例草案嘅條文嘅。噉啊，每一次我哋往往提出即係話喺有税務嘅寬減啊，或者税務優惠嘅時候咧，我相信絕大部分嘅誒公誒誒業界咧都會係支持。

199
00:46:49,910 --> 00:47:09,920
有關嘅建議嘅，當然咧喺誒有啲嘅反避税嘅條文裏面咧，誒業界係有一啲嘅疑慮啦，或者唔係好清楚究竟政府嘅用意係啲咩嘢嘅時候咧，我哋好樂意咧係誒向業界咧，向誒有關嘅納税人啦，向誒向誒呢個委員會咧係詳細去解。

200
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:29,930
介紹，為此咧，我哋今日亦都特別係誒總結翻喺過去我哋喺草擬呢個條例草案嘅時候曾經接獲嘅主要意見，其實同今日咧我哋所聽到嘅意見，同埋誒早前咧係誒誒，秘書畀過我哋一啲嘅誒誒，即係團體誒用書面嘅形式表達。

201
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:49,940
嘅意見咧，其實大同小異嘅。噉我覺得我哋都有責任咧，係同誒主席同委員各位咧，係分享翻政府嘅睇法，即係睇翻即係喺個別嘅一啲條文裏面咧，點解一啲嘅誒誒一啲嘅即係措施或者係反避税嘅措施咧，係一定要有嗰個保。

202
00:50:46,670 --> 00:51:00,080
嘅話咧，噉我哋就覺得要考慮個公司要考慮佢整體嘅税務效率啦，同埋佢集團形式嗰個嘅誒策略嘅考慮。呢一個我相信，即係誒，我哋香港嘅業界一定有方法係去應變得到。

203
00:54:42,220 --> 00:55:00,220
就會有一個唔對稱嘅問題，所以調翻轉嚟講，我哋都要處理埋嗰個利息收入係應該用乜嘢嘅税務原則去處理。咁正如我上次亦都誒好開清楚同各位委員去交代咧，我哋今次喺嘅十五條嗰個diminishing provisions咧，並唔係話。

204
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:19,580
咁誒，我個文件分咗做主要七個誒七個具體嘅意見咧，亦都正話大部分人士都有提及到嘅。啊，雖然誒第一項咧就係話，我瞭解到即係大部分嘅誒財資嘅業界嘅人士咧，正話都有幾位代表都清楚咁講，其實佢。

205
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:39,590
佢哋整體上係歡迎誒呢個利得税嘅寬減嘅噉，但係咧，對於個別有啲公司嚟講咧，可能由於佢哋個集團嘅運作或者架構咧，佢亦都未必一時三刻可以咧係誒誒完全係配合到誒呢個條例有關嘅要求咧，就係話我哋要求咧有關。

206
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:59,600
集團公司要用一個獨立嘅法團嘅形式去從事嗰個企業財資活動，而事實上，我哋都係好認真咁諗過業界誒，就呢個意見就係問係咪可以一定要用一個獨立嘅法團嘅形式去從事企業財資活動咧？如果唔用嘅話，

207
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:19,610
又誒，可唔可以咧？噉我哋都內部都有好多嘅研究同埋辯論，都睇過就係我哋誒有一個擔心，就係話我哋誒以往誒提出一啲噉嘅措施嘅時候，我哋都會考慮到誒，因為今次係一個半額嘅課税嘅制度，噉係將成個利得税係總共。

208
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:46,640
畀個別嘅公司咧，係會誒將一啲嘅所謂嘅金融交易所產生嘅一個虧損咧，包裝成為企業財資嘅交易咧，用以降低一個香港集團公司嘅應課利得税。呢一個係一個實實在在嘅擔心嚟。二如果我哋唔倒失一個可能會出現嘅流

209
00:49:46,640 --> 00:50:06,650
流動嘅時候咧，對我哋嗰個税基嘅侵蝕咧，係會有不良嘅影響。唔單止我哋係香港會係有一個影響，亦都我哋會有機會畀國際社會咧係誒會批評我哋香港咧係做一個噉嘅措施，係誒做到係税基侵蝕或者係誒雙重不課税嘅情。

210
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:26,660
況噉，所以我哋希望咧，就係話，如果業界睇到有個好處係誒利用呢個利得税嘅寬減咧，去減低整個嘅誒誒誒財資中心嘅經營成本嘅話咧，我哋歡迎佢哋咧係誒做一啲嘅調整咧，係用一個獨立法團嘅形式去從事企業財資活。

211
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:46,670
動，於是者咧噉就會防止一啲集團公司將一啲唔屬於企業財資中心嘅收入轉入半額嗰個課税制度，咁亦都係避免爭拗。呢一點我哋相信咧，對於誒納税人嚟講咧，對於税局嚟講咧，都係可以做得到嘅安排。但係至於會唔會每一間公司都會轉變呢個架構？

212
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:20,610
第二咧，正話我哋都誒聽到有一一兩位誒誒意見咧，係表示過咧，就係對嗰個股權公司嘅股息收入誒，會唔會影響到咧？噉我我諗要澄清就係，我諗誒主席你都好清楚，股息收入喺香港係唔唔需要係徵税嘅嚇。噉我哋呢套制度。

213
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:40,620
亦都唔會咧，係對控權公司嘅股息收入嘅徵税咧有任何嘅影響嘅。咁所以，我哋希望業界唔好誤會，就係話誒呢個寬免點解唔能夠誒惠及到控權公司咧？其實控權公司本身嘅股息收入已經係唔唔喺香港係徵税㗎啦。但係如果

214
00:51:40,620 --> 00:52:00,630
係誒，正如有誒代表有朋友有提到，就係話會唔會又有啲控權公司做緊少少或者部分嘅企業財資職能嘅時候，咁又點算咧？噉樣樣噉，我哋其實都考慮過嘅喺我哋誒草擬呢條法例嘅時候，我哋亦都聽到呢啲意見，我哋認真地咧就覺得我哋不如。

215
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:20,640
試下提供一個安全港嘅規則，咁喺條文裏面咧喺個十四E條亦都提供咗出嚟，就係話如果嗰個發團整體嚟講有百分之七十五以上嘅利潤係源自企業財資活動，咁亦都同時有百分之七十五以上嘅資產係進行企業財資活動嘅話咧，咁有關。

216
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:40,650
嘅合資格利潤咧，我哋都畀佢按半額去去利得税去繳税，咁即係唔係一個一刀切嘅原則。我哋即係如果佢大部分嚇百分之七十五嘅利潤或者係資產，我嚟做財資活動，我哋都畀佢一個半額嘅利得税嗰個寬免啦。咁而股息收入，無論如何都唔會。

217
00:52:40,650 --> 00:53:00,660
係徵税噉，我相信呢度已經有一個合理嘅平衡咧，係確保咧係主要經營企業財資活動嘅公司係符合呢個條件，而亦都呢個就係我哋正正今日嗰個嘅誒政策嘅目標。我哋今日政策目標唔係特別話係推廣股權公司，因為本身嚟講股息收入已經唔徵税。

218
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:45,620
噉樣係唔會影響嚇現時企業財資中心嗰個競爭力同埋。

219
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:12,340
誒subject to tax嘅意思咧係has been paid or will be paid嘅。

220
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:33,580
即係要交咗税嘅啦，咁但係如果係個虧損好大，根本間企業。

221
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:19,090
誒，咁點解唔係同一般？即係話，比如你有個law situation，你。

222
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:26,680
你冇得比啦，噉你會唔會有？即係嗰年，如果嗰個overseas company。

223
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:22,180
咁第三行咧就係誒有誒一兩位誒誒誒業界嘅代表有提及到咧，就係話對於誒税務條例第十五條嘅第一款嘅I A同埋L A條嗰個誒税務處理嗰個即係政策用意係係做緊乜嘢嘢咧？咁噉我喺呢度有責任要向委員解。

224
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:42,190
解釋咧就係當初我哋有一個動機去做呢個條例草案嘅時候咧，係因為業界咧嚇，亦都我哋睇到係一個事實，就係話誒有噉嘅情況，有一個税務不對稱嘅問題。嗰個税務不對稱嘅問題咧，就係話有一啲嘅企業財資中公司喺香港，佢哋經

225
00:53:42,190 --> 00:54:02,200
經營一啲內部融資嘅業務，佢哋同非香港嘅商業化團嘅貸款交易咧，佢哋嘅收入係要課税嘅。因為現時有案例同埋嘅税務嘅指引，亦都已經講清楚嗰個operation test咧係佢哋係要課税嘅。咁但係咧，佢哋嗰個嘅誒同呢啲非香。

226
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:22,210
香港商聯化團嘅借款所產生嘅利息支出咧，又冇得扣除，即係一方面又要喺個利息收入徵税，喺個支出咧又冇得扣税，咁咪唔對等噉嘅情況啦。噉我哋覺得呢個業界嗰個考慮係誒，我哋可以處理嘅。咁所以我哋就用第十六條係畀即係開。

227
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:42,220
開多個窗口，畀佢哋啲利息支出可以係可以扣減嗰個利得税。但係當有一個扣減嘅時候，我哋一定要確保就係個大前提就係，正如亦都個不對稱嘅情況，一開始就係話，因為佢哋嘅利息收入係會課税㗎嘛，咁先至會喺而家冇呢條法例底下嘅情況。

228
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:20,510
容易引入新嘅原則，而事實上嗰個經營測試嗰個原則咧，係喺Orang Caribbean嗰個case以後咧，一直税局亦都沿用。我哋針對嘅唔係普通嘅誒借款嘅交易，唔係一般嘅landing或者誒有關嘅transaction啊，講緊嘅係內部融。

229
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:40,520
資業務嘅時候嘅一啲嘅貸款誒嘅產生嘅利息收入嘅噉，所以我哋今次第十五條嗰個修訂咧，其實冇改變税例第十四條嘅徵税條文，亦都我哋唔認為咧係超越咧Oriental Caribbean呢個案例同埋現時咧DIPN十三裡面咧有關嘅。

230
00:55:40,520 --> 00:56:00,530
原則嘅，咁對於一般如果並不屬於誒經營集團內部融資業務嘅貸款嘅交易咧，有關嗰個嘅誒利息收入咧，我哋仍然係會沿用咧誒提供信貸測試方法，即係professional credit test嘅。噉我哋喺誒草擬。

231
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:20,540
第十五條嘅時候係好小心去寫嗰個條文咧，就令到誒唔係話所有嘅landing嘅transaction，所有借錢嘅trans誒貸款嘅transaction咧誒顯身嘅interest income利息收入咧都會係徵税。我哋只係話經營集團內部融資業務叫嗰啲嘅利。

232
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:40,550
息收入先至用呢一個經營測試方法去處理嘅。噉我相信呢個，如果經過我哋咁詳細咁去釐清，或者喺誒誒條條例草案通過之後咧，税局如果係會出一啲嘅税務嘅practice notes嘅DIPN嘅指引，我相信亦都會係令到係解釋得清楚嘅話咧。

233
00:56:46,860 --> 00:57:06,870
咁誒，亦都正話有團體有提到，就係佢哋非常歡迎四十六二G啊，提供一個新嘅窗口，可以畀佢哋呢啲誒經營內部融資業務嘅誒公司咧誒，係可以喺嗰個利得税裏面扣減個利息嘅支出啦。嚇噉，但係我哋過往。

234
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:26,880
講嘅經驗咧，就係喺十六二裡面嘅利息扣減咧，係一貫以嚟都提供咗好多嘅誘因咧，係會有啲公司係刻意安排咧，係一啲嘅貸款誒一啲借款，令到咧產生龐大嘅利息支出嘅。咁誒，我哋所以我哋十六二嘅G嗰個新定嘅條例裡面咧。

235
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:46,890
我哋要確保要有個避税嗰個機會咧，就係話我哋誒畀你減呢個利息嘅誒誒支出，但係同時咧，我哋要知道嗰個利息同一個集團裡面嗰個利息收入喺另一個地方係課税。咁呢個亦都係符合。啊，我想暫即係暫停你呢度啫。我想問呢個問題。

236
00:57:46,890 --> 00:58:06,900
就係究竟而家呢個誒呢個anti-avoidance呢一個specific provision咧，係subject to tax similar to profit tax呢個一定要pay the tax咧。究竟點即係究竟係點樣樣咧？可唔可以澄清下？我哋喺嗰個誒主席誒，多謝你嘅提問。我哋喺誒嗰個條例裡面咧，其實都講咗係。

237
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:40,480
好誒敏合嘅情況咧，就係個十七G嗰度，呢個我哋正話都聽到有兩位有提提議嘅。

238
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:32,020
銀行業界或者其他委員都有提及過，我哋要小心，就係話會唔會我哋太過優厚，即係令到誒有出有機會出現一個嘅abuse嘅情況咧？噉。

239
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:46,970
啊，係一個in-law situation，即係冇冇interest，即係冇冇profit tax畀到，但係佢係subject to tax喎，即係佢將來會畀嘅，佢將係會畀嘅。foreseeably，佢佢會make profit。咁究竟減唔減減唔減到咧？即係香港公司減唔減到嗰個interest deduction咧？究竟啊，呢個情況啊。

240
00:58:47,950 --> 00:59:07,960
誒，我請阿税務好阿趙副局長，唔該你啊。多謝主席。誒，喺解解釋嗰個subject to tax呢個觀念上高咧，如果嗰個收嘅group company有pay個tax噉，即係佢真係交過税，咁呢點咧，我諗係比較清楚可以理解嘅。

241
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:27,970
如果個情況係話有一啲虧損，噉啊點咧？咁亦會有幾點會考慮嘅，因為嗰個企業整體可能有利潤，有其他嘅虧損，但係我哋都係睇一個即係盈利減咗虧損之後，使唔使交税？因為個利息嘅收入係其中一部分嘅。咁喺呢種情，我哋都認為係。

242
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:53,870
好多年都冇交過税，噉我哋唔認同咧。呢個係交咗税，或者將會係交税嘅情況。嗯，好，即係都要睇情況。好啊，阿阿廖生，請你繼續，唔好意思。誒，多謝主席。就呢一點咧，我哋誒都要小心咧，就係因為好意思啲喺上年通過咗嗰個嘅誒，即係Beps啦，税基侵蝕同埋。

243
00:59:53,870 --> 01:00:13,880
誒，即係希望誒唔同嘅地方咧，都有一個雙重不課税嗰個嘅誒情況咧。所以我哋都要好小心，就係話，如果我哋誒唔要求有關嘅利息收入喺另外一啲地方係獲徵税嘅話咧，我哋香港亦都會有機會咧，係畀其他嘅地方咧係話我哋係做緊。

244
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:33,890
一啲損人不利己嘅問題啊，或者係誒有一啲唔合理嘅雙重不課税嘅跨國交易，我哋都畀佢喺香港扣税咧。呢個對我哋香港嗰個税基嗰個嘅誒信心咧，係誒會有即係影響，亦都對我哋一貫以嚟嘅聲譽係會有影響嘅。咁所以我哋呢個。

245
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:53,900
個係平衡過有關嘅國際嘅壓力咧，係先提出嘅一個嘅誒情況嚟嘅。噉我哋都希望咧業界能夠瞭解。咁最後咧，我想補充就係誒嗰個監管資本證券個税務處理咧，就係誒喺我哋誒同唔同嘅銀行誒討論呢個題材嘅。

246
01:00:53,900 --> 01:01:13,910
嘅時候咧，一貫我哋都聽到個信息就係佢哋非常歡迎呢一個嘅誒誒有關嘅税務處理，因為咧，我哋咧係將嗰啲嘅誒巴塞爾條例誒協定三底下嘅一啲A.T.一同埋T.A. Two嗰個誒誒資本嘅誒一啲嘅票據咧係。

247
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:33,920
視為債券噉係畀銀行可以一個扣税嘅用途嘅，咁呢個情況係可以令到咧係誒銀行嗰個利得税咧係可以因此而獲得扣減。噉我哋都誒唯一咧就係我相信業界同我哋嘅其中誒僅有嘅一兩個嘅唔係好吻合，有啲意見唔係。

248
01:01:40,850 --> 01:02:00,860
噉我其實上一次會都有提到，就係誒十七G嗰個嘅誒獨立企業嘅原則咧。其實我哋希望誒誒業界唔好誤會咧，就係話誒我哋呢個十七G其實係純粹係為咗係處理個監管資本證券集資嘅情況而衍生嘅税務問題，我哋先至會。

249
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:20,870
用十七G去處理，咁即係話咧，如果有境外嘅銀行，其實佢唔係透過發行監管資本證券去集資嘅話咧，根本就唔存在十七G即係可以適用呢個情況。而我相信我哋喺逐條審議嘅時候帶委員去睇嘅時候咧，你都會睇到咧，十七G並唔會有一。

250
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:40,880
一個咧係超越咗嚇資本證券，即係嗰個集資嘅情況以外嘅税務情況咧，都會適用。咁呢個並唔係我哋嘅用意嚟嘅。咁誒喺嗰條條例裏面咧，我哋其實為咗只係為咗係想確保咧，就係一啲境外嘅銀行唔會將過量嘅誒一啲嘅利息支出。

251
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,550
情況，但係咧，你哋。

252
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,260
我哋團體，淨得我一個啫嘛！我問下啦。

253
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:05,880
要向海外嘅母公司及其他海外嘅分支。

254
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,970
取得相關嘅數字，只能夠向税務局報税嘅。

255
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:39,570
我我就講到呢度，我就畀時間啊，阿委員啊，張華峯，你首先你有冇問題問我哋嘅團體先啊？啊啊張議員。

256
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:26,900
噉，但係我睇到亞洲資本市場税務委員會啊，CMTC嘅意見咧，似乎咧條例入邊咧，特別係十七支條咧。

257
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:16,160
發行LCS嘅税務處理咧，嗱，所以呢條條例應該為業界帶嚟便利同埋帶嚟實質嘅利益嘅，噉就唔應該反而咧增加業界嘅負擔嘅。

258
01:07:47,370 --> 01:08:01,610
銀行嘅不平等嘅條約，嗱，根據我所瞭解咧，如果海外銀行喺香港分行，如果因為發行RCS而想得到政府税務嘅優惠咧，

259
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:48,000
就回應翻啊團體今日所提出嘅喺呢個文件度未未涵蓋嘅一個一啲嘅論點啦。咁誒，另外咧，我想啊啊廖生頭先講嘅十七H咧，其實十七H嗰個解讀咧。

260
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:30,790
咁實質上佢哋係難啲做到。頭先咧有啲誒代表已經講過，即係佢哋嘅解釋同埋論點啦。我而家想問問政府咧，呢條條例修定之後咧，誒是否與香港地域內源嘅徵税原則有相？

261
01:02:40,880 --> 01:03:00,890
咧係放喺香港做扣減，因為我哋瞭解過，唔係所有嘅地方都做咗我哋呢一個監管資本證券嗰個嘅税務嘅優惠喺度嘅，咁所以變咗一啲跨國嘅銀行咧，係會有有因咧，係如果我哋係冇呢一個十七G嘅話咧，而。

262
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:20,900
喺香港係以一個分行嘅形式經營嘅時候咧，因為分行同總行其實係同一個個體嚟嘅，嚇。咁如果冇一個噉嘅十七G嘅時候咧，會有機會咧出現咧，佢哋喺香港嘅利息收入、利息嘅扣減咧係過量嘅。咁呢一個亦都我哋要平衡，因為我喺我哋聽其他唔係。

263
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:52,330
所以十七G，我哋係亦都保障庫房嘅税收咧，就係我哋引入一個獨立企業原則。其實呢個獨立企業原則咧喺我哋誒簽嗰啲嘅誒double taxation嘅treaty，亦都經常出現㗎啦。咁所以誒，應該咧，我哋相信唔會話即係誒對於業界嚟講係陌生嘅，亦都呢一個。

264
01:03:52,330 --> 01:04:12,340
原則咧並唔係話諗住喺誒，我哋藉住十七G或者十七H咧，係影響誒其他唔係銀行啊，或者唔係而家我哋所講緊監管資本證券嘅税務狀況咧，裡面嘅其他嘅運用呢個並唔係我哋嘅用意嚟嘅。我哋喺文件裏面都講得好清楚，我哋。

265
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:32,350
十七H咧係唔，我哋希望係做到就係話釐清咧呢個條例呢個條文咧。十七G咧係唔會影響呢個原則喺監管資本證券以外嘅情況運用。咁所以我正話聽到可能有啲團體即係會擔心，哇會唔會即係引入咗一個新嘅税務原則？誒呢個。

266
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:52,360
税務原則咧就會有機會誒，完全係對香港嘅税務嘅誒誒誒架構啊，或者一貫以嚟嘅誒其他嘅税務嘅狀況會有影響，而有翻天覆地嘅變化。其實就呢個並唔係我哋嘅用意，我哋只係想處理係如果境外銀行藉住分行誒喺香港。

267
01:04:52,360 --> 01:05:12,370
講嚟做呢個扣減嘅時候，嘅利息扣減一定要係相稱，同埋唔好過量。咁如果做到呢個效果，我哋覺得而家十七G同埋H嘅草案係可以做到呢個效果嘅。噉我哋可以喺逐條審議嘅時候咧，再將誒即係呢啲嘅意見咧對對照翻有關嘅條文，我可以再喺嗰個層。

268
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:32,380
詞裏面再同委員去解釋嚇，噉我諗個介紹可以去到呢度。多謝主席啊，阿廖生唔該咁麻煩啦。嗯，政府咧，如果呢個零一號文件係未涵蓋今日今日嘅團體一啲嘅論點嘅時候咧，請你再畀多一份補充嘅文件。噉我就睇翻呢個similar format，一個table form嘅。

269
01:05:48,510 --> 01:06:08,520
嗰個interpretation咧就係引起好多爭議，因因為其實十七eight我就覺得根本就唔係話加咗好多嘢落去，只不過澄清咗就係啊個arm星同supplement誒enterprise principle咧就就應該就唔就就會係誒唔會apply喺其他non financial institution嘅情。

270
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:30,880
草擬呢條條例嘅時候咧，就畀人哋一個感覺咧，就話：喂，唔係喎，原來我哋唔係會apply到其他嘅情況喎。即係即係你哋喺一個草擬嗰個嗰個技術層面上，可能有有有些少問題係係要調節嘅呢樣嘢。你哋諗一諗嘅十七H係一個好大嘅一個解讀嘅一個問題嗱。

271
01:06:43,620 --> 01:07:03,630
嗱，呢個呢個呢個其實呢個修訂咧，目的係希望提出一啲優惠嘅呢個呢個税務咧，去吸引即係海外嘅投資者喺香港設立個財資中心嘅。咁以及咧釐清咧根據巴塞爾協議三銀龍發行師或

272
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:33,300
係。

273
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,650
違反咧。

274
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,480
阿張華峯議員有冇跟進啊？你？

275
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:02,410
我掌握嘅資料，手上嘅資料係冇咩問題嘅啦。

276
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,200
阿張議員，你仲有冇對呢條條例草案有冇其他問題啊？

277
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:10,530
希望多啲瞭解下，即係嗰個條例之中嘅嗰個存在嘅問題啦。嗯嗯嗯，好。

278
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:20,070
嘅原則去檢驗佢係咪真係要交香港税？咁所以咧，我諗我哋要澄清呢點嘅十七支係冇改變現時香港沿用咗幾十年嘅地域來源嘅原則嘅。

279
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:06,920
就跟住一個國際標準，考慮佢嘅職能啦、資產啦同埋風險嚟計算佢應該有幾多利潤。喺計到算到呢個數字之後咧，我哋再用翻我哋本地嘅地域來源。

280
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:41,820
誒，冇啦。好誒，噉我可以今日就好多謝各位團體出席。噉我會我哋會成個委員會咧，係會詳細考慮你哋提出嚟嘅意見，再下一次會議咧，再再同政府去商討各項嘅提出嘅建議。多謝曬，唔該曬各位。

281
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:47,370
啊，對佢哋帶嚟有啲困擾嘅，噉啊，可能影響銀行日後如果要合符嗰個法例嗰方面咧，就會更加複雜啦。噉啊，條例亦都改變咗香港一直以來人樣嘅地域來源嘅徵税嘅原則。噉啊，十七支亦都始會成為銀

282
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:52,940
誒，反而令到香港嘅税務更加複雜，會否影響外資嚟香港投資嘅意欲？係阿周華峯議員，你有冇嘢需要誒，我哋嘅團體去補充或者回應你㗎？誒，幾乎我已經瞭解咗大部分。好，咁不如咧，我我我請埋政府答完之後，就團體可以離席先，因為之後我要。

283
01:08:52,940 --> 01:09:12,950
會再誒有其他嘅嘅跟進，但係呢一條問題咧，十七G呢條問題其實都有好多人關心，所以我都想啲團友聽聽。阿邊位回答啊？十七G呢個問題係咪會影響個地域來源徵税原則咧？好啊，不誒誒，我請阿税務局局誒副局長誒講講呢幾。

284
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:32,960
實質層面，或誒或者誒，我誒講一講頭先啊張議員誒，多謝佢意見咧。誒所觸及嘅一點咧，當然我哋而家嘅建議咧，誒特別係嗰一個誒誒企業財資同埋銀行嗰個誒監管資本嗰個證券方面咧，其實誒喺我哋。

285
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:52,970
吸引啊外資嘅企業嚟嘅同時咧，我哋亦都希望係做到咧本地嘅企業都係誒受惠嘅。咁因此呢一度咧，喺特別喺企業財資方面，剛才誒亦都有企業嘅代表講，我哋如果香港嘅集團嘅嘅公司誒，佢哋都希望可以係用到，亦都實際上。

286
01:09:52,970 --> 01:10:12,980
佢哋都會因應環境咧，誒喺佢哋嗰個內部個企業個財資處理嘅時候咧，希望用到我哋依一套嘅便利嘅措施。因此咧，誒對內對外，我哋都希望做到一個誒推動。噉就住嗰所謂地域來源嗰個税務嘅問題，我請阿副局長。

287
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:32,990
係，阿阿趙生，唔該你。多多謝主席。就條文嘅十七G咧，其實一個比較特別針對性嘅反避税條文嘅。嗱，裏邊用到嘅所謂獨立嘅原則咧，其實喺香港咧唔係一個新嘅概念嘅。喺我哋嘅雙邊嘅税務協議已經引入咗呢個觀念。

288
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:53,640
咁喺考慮話呢個條文裏邊會唔會改變咗我哋地域來源呢個準則咧？其實係唔會嘅。嗱，我哋首先係決定一個誒誒金融誒呢個財務機構嘅分行應該有幾多利潤咧？我哋要跟隨呢個獨立企業原則。

289
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,890
啊，座務委員有問題啊，其他。

290
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,370
一六年嘅今年二月廿九號。

291
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:25,680
嘅嘅關注點咧，係會剔除咗嘅，嚇，唔該啊！

292
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:56,800
或者你會出幾多個DIP咧？諗住喺喺喺呢條條例草案入邊啊，唔該嚇。

293
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,580
本嗰個嗰部分嘅，即係會有兩張嘅DIP，有兩張DIP。咁噉，我有一個嘅誒。

294
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:57,260
誒聽到業界意見啦，同埋啊主席，你剛才一啲建議，我諗我哋翻去考慮嚇誒，即係最好多個做法，多謝你，包括DIPN嗰個做法嚇。

295
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:55,840
出嘅逐條審議，噉我喺呢度咧係宣佈今日嗰個啊財委會會議暫時結束，噉係好多謝各位委員，亦都好多謝啊政府官員入嚟嘅，唔該曬啊！

296
01:13:44,910 --> 01:14:01,940
值嘅建議咧，你可唔可以第一即係可唔可以睇緊十七H係咪真係要需要擺一個噉嘅條款喺度去澄清一樣，即係澄清嘅喎整個十七H。如果你覺得十七H個澄清嘅作用其實反個頭嚟會係。

297
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:30,890
啊，或者我我有一條嘅問題咧，就頭先提出咗嘅。我諗我諗就政府要考慮下就誒，因為其實我聽到大部分嘅誒議會嘅人士咧，都都關心十七G同埋十七H兩個section嘅。

298
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:51,070
咁第一，我聽到就誒阿阿廖生講過話，可能會有一個誒DIPN，或或者我唔知局長會會係即係可以喺度澄清嗰個誒DIPN係咪即係會涵蓋呢一個嘅誒CTC誒同埋個intercut、integrated finance。

299
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:17,360
多謝主席。咁咧，税局個立場咧，我哋一定會出一個D I P解説咧，就係呢個企業財資中心係點樣去徵税，或者嗰個寬減係點樣可以攞到嘅。咁有一有會有一張D I P喺度，我哋初步構思會有另外一張添，就解説呢個誒所謂銀行監管資。

300
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:44,910
提議或者一個觀察咧，因為十七H咧就的確係引起一啲嘅用家，就算係有有法律背景嘅嘅，或者係做咗税務好耐嘅用家一啲嘅關注。而十七H的確只不過係澄清一啲嘅疑點。嗱，如果你哋可以考慮啊本。

301
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:22,230
仲即係製造多啲嘅誤解嘅時候，倒不如咧，你可唔可以將十七H呢個澄清嘅作用擺咗喺你個DIPN嗰度咧？因為你係咪都有兩個DIPN㗎啦？咁反正嚟講，即係你哋可唔可以做咗呢一點咧？如果係做咗呢一點嘅時候，我諗好多嘅業界朋友嘅嘅。

302
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:47,150
好啊！多謝主席。啊，殷殷女士係係多謝主席。嗯，實證正如你所講咧，其實誒十七H個原意咧就係話提供一個確定性同埋清晰嗰個情況，即係話即係我哋誒建議嘅係針對翻而家講嘅嚇所謂監管資本嗰個情況嚟㗎。不過誒。

303
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:21,250
嗱，如果冇嘅時候咧，就我就可以就宣佈今日暫時就停召會，因為咧，我都想大家有啲時間睇翻各位團體上嚟嘅意見，同埋政府嘅答案咧，先正係會逐條審議。而我希望咧，就最快而家我哋定到咧就係。

304
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:45,060
星期一下午四點三十分就會誒再開呢個草案委員個會議。如果希望喺之前咧係攞到啊，政府今日回應啊團體嘅補充文件，噉我哋希望咧下次咧就討論完個補充文件之後咧就可以再。
