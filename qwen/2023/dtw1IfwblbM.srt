令到樂園成為香港市民喺疫情期間一個休閒與親友共度節日假日嘅一個目的地。

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:41,370
噉我哋而家歡迎政府嘅代表同埋迪士尼嘅代表出席我哋今日嘅會議。嗯，我哋今日有誒，我哋。

27
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:59,120
三年嘅疫情咧，對香港迪士尼嘅營運咧，其實係帶嚟咗好大嘅挑戰。入境旅遊、入境旅遊咧全面停頓，而樂園咧亦都需要強制關閉咧，合共十三個月。但係香港迪士尼咧靈活應對。

28
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:43,820
唔使，我講聲啦。請我哋政府嗰邊開始。好啊，好啊，好啊，多謝主持。有十分鐘。係。好啊，好啊。今日嘅議程咧，其實係彙報香港迪士尼咧喺二零二二年嘅財政年度，即係話由二零二一年嘅十月初去到二零二二年嘅十月初嘅營運情況。

31
00:02:43,900 --> 00:03:03,910
我哋今日有我哋嘅啊楊局長啦，我哋有啊，我哋嘅沈鳳軍嘅旅遊事務專員，同埋我哋鍾允妮女士啊，我哋嘅副專員嘅。咁迪士尼有我哋嘅Michael啊個行政總裁，跟住有Anita係。

32
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,730
嘅音樂會咧。

33
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,490
We facilitated cast testing and provided on-site vaccinations.

34
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,570
最 importantly， we have not laid off any cast members in the past three years.

35
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,490
requirements relating to face masks, COVID testing, capacity limits, and more.

36
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,360
And we provided support to underserved groups in our community, which I will share with you more later.

37
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,820
但Despite all these challenges, we did not stop investing and continued to launch new products and offerings for our local guests.

38
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:06,940
at the same time, we are very focused on the well-being of our 6,000 cast members, their family, and supporting the wider community.

39
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:56,320
作為一間設計和建構以支援旅遊的企業，我們 had to make significant changes. Changes I believe will make us stronger as we begin our recovery.

40
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:46,700
however， inbound tourism， both for mainland and international arrivals， was brought to a stop， and we had to focus on a locals only market strategy.

41
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:29,720
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the past three years, we've weathered challenges and enjoyed successes, but I'd like to start by talking about the challenges first.

42
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:38,370
同香港芭蕾舞團推出嘅Stellar夢想起舞吧嘅表演啦，以及復辦咗香港迪士尼樂園十K Weekend二零二三嘅派步跑步活動。

43
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:35,800
honouring what I said last year, we have not asked for additional funding from Legco. The Walt Disney Company upsized our revolver to 2.7 billion to support our liquidity should we have needed it.

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:44,190
since 2020， our resort went through multiple mandatory closures， which lasted for more than a year in total。 We were subject to a long list of anti-pandemic measures， including travel restrictions and flight bans。

45
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:17,770
週年嘅慶典活動等等，政府對香港迪士尼未來嘅業務同埋長期嘅潛力咧，係感到樂觀。我而家請樂園嘅行政總裁莫偉霆先生Michael同大家介紹樂園喺二零二二年嘅財政年度嘅營運情況，然後咧我哋會回答委員嘅提問。Michael，over to you please。

46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:28,100
誒樂園咧係喺單靠本地市場之下咧係捱過咗幾年艱難嘅時光。即使喺二零二二年財政年度全年咧係只係開放咗一百九十日，香港迪士尼咧喺年內嘅總入場人次咧仍然係按年上升咗百分之廿二，去到三百四十萬，再創全年本地。

47
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:25,230
繼續致力服務本地社羣，包括派發近六萬張嘅門票畀弱勢社羣，投入超過三千小時嘅義工服務等等。我哋咧亦都好一好開心咧，知道咧誒香港迪士尼咧係致力推動文化、娛樂、體育同埋旅遊融合嘅工作，例如舉辦咗六場迪士尼音樂拉。

48
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:58,680
踏入二零二三嘅財政年度咧，入境嘅旅遊會逐步復恢復甦，加上香港迪士尼咧，今年一連串嘅項目包括咗喺七月重開迪士尼荷里活酒店，十一月推出嘅全球首個《魔雪奇緣》世界主題樂園主主題園區，以及迪士尼咧一百週。

49
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,710
key pillar of Hong Kong tourism.

50
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,530
和 guests age 60 and above.

51
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,500
一個career development and job recruitment expo。

52
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,090
Revenue grew 31% to 2.2 billion.

53
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,070
however，against all these odds，we've found our way forward。

54
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,160
with multiple scholarship opportunities for those who aspire to join the industry.

55
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,530
among locals， we've seen another historic high for attendance from young adults， youth programmes。

56
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:28,130
for a third year in a row, we posted record-high local attendance, driving total attendance up by 22%.

57
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,760
With the resumption of inbound tourism and resorts expansion, we also held the Disney Open House for Dreammakers in February this year.

58
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:58,370
Our financial results have shown steady improvement across all fronts year over year, as we continue to manage our costs prudently while driving revenue.

59
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:48,350
我們也深層我們的聯繫與我們的粉絲羣體，跨越所有人口統計，如我們的Magic Access成員，達到歷史高點，也成長22%。

60
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:12,900
EBITDA improved 11% to negative 861 million， and net loss improved by 12% from the previous year to 2.1 billion.

61
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:48,920
With respect to jobs, we're happy to see the resort was once again recognised as one of the most attractive employers in Hong Kong, and we continue to be one of Hong Kong's largest employers in the tourism and family entertainment industry.

62
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:23,690
We also focus on providing opportunities for the city's youth to thrive with the annual Disney Imagination Hong Kong Design Competition that nurtures future talent and storytellers. Additionally, we launched the Dare to Dream program to inspire young people to dream big.

63
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:17,000
To better manage our costs in such a tough business environment, we were compelled to adjust our park and hotel operations for another year, with the theme park only open for about half the fiscal year, twenty five days less than the previous year, and on the hotel front, only the Disneyland Hotel was open throughout fiscal twenty two.

64
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:33,460
Our value to Hong Kong goes beyond this. However, in the past seventeen years of operations, the resort has brought in approximately one hundred and sixteen billion dollars of value to the Hong Kong economy and created over two hundred and seventy seven zero jobs. We are benefiting the economy, creating jobs and serve as a

65
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,200
and donating around sixty thousand complimentary tickets.

66
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,800
with the Hong Kong Ballet in 2023, all with rave reviews.

67
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,930
We've developed an expansive cadence of cultural tourism offerings.

68
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,300
我們也服務年輕患者，以獨特的方式，以迪士尼魔法。

69
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:45,040
We're doing our part to promote synergy among culture, entertainment, sports and tourism as well.

70
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,780
We believe we have a big role to play in our community, especially in times when Hong Kong needs it the most.

71
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,070
The pandemic was a reminder that our community work needs to be agile, especially for the elderly.

72
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,270
The resort offers inclusive products and offerings, including theatrical interpretation in its theatre shows. The barrier-free

73
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:03,010
The return of our 10K weekend in March this year also saw record high attendance, with close to 18,000 contestants.

74
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:10,940
to nurture the next generation of athletes, our sports legacy scheme programme is providing training to underserved youth students.

75
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:04,930
ambassador training program and the Disney side by side journey, which is designed to provide a friendly job environment and opportunities for people with disabilities.

76
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:55,270
We hosted Hong Kong's biggest homecoming celebration for local athletes, without with around 100 without around a thousand medalists and their teams joining.

77
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:38,890
Not only did we support them with complimentary park visits, our Disney volunteers continue to care for the elderly over the phone, while we were under strict social distancing.

78
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:21,200
partnering with Make-A-Wish Hong Kong and other NGOs, we are humbled that we were asked to help support these children and families as they face some of life's toughest challenges.

79
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:43,490
We put in place initiatives to empower and uplift the people of Hong Kong, including donating food and essentials to underserved families, creating free online storytelling videos, bringing joy to kids at home.

80
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:34,470
The first ever in-park live orchestra performance, curated with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 2021, was a huge success. We continued with the momentum by holding six Disney Live in concerts in 2022, and debuted Stella Lou's Wonderful Wishes ballet.

81
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,890
嗯。

82
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,700
咧都期盼一個叫做。

83
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,380
漫威英雄嘅新園區，唔知有冇落成嘅時間表？

84
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,160
《World of Frozen》 represents Hong Kong Disneyland's largest expansion so far.

85
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:58,220
Thank you, Michael, and thank you for the invitation. And I work with the secretariat office to to liaise on on the dates for for possible visits to to Disney then.

86
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:49,180
looking ahead，the much-awaited World of Frozen，the world's first and biggest themed land based on the Frozen movie，will officially open at Hong Kong Disneyland in November.

87
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:27,840
優達跟議員融海欣言十四個人，噉我哋每誒三分鐘連問連答。誒please誒keep the誒the answer short，because we um and precise please。

88
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:20,170
Beginning on July 14th, hotel guests can check out the new look of the hotel lobby and two restaurants at Disney's Hollywood Hotel, which has been closed for scheduled renovation during the pandemic.

89
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:32,470
在過去幾年，我們 laid 一個強固的基礎，上邊我們開始踏上一個顯著的轉變，藉助迪士尼無與倫比的敍事、創意和創新。

90
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:08,290
Frozen has has has a strong fan base and is the number one Disney franchise in Asia. Mr. Chairman, I would like to extend an invitation to all the panel members to join us for a visit to the Kingdom of Arendelle later this season.

91
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:48,330
普唔普遍，還是係係咪都要改善下咧？我諗全世界都冇話喺個電商買完之後就自己去現場攞嘅噉樣嘅做法嘅。嗱，我想聽聽佢哋解釋。唔該。好，唔該，局長。迪士尼嗰邊答呢個問題嚇。

92
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:48,160
Now with renewed energy and excitement, we are grateful to have the boundless support of our cast members, Hong Kongers, guests and stakeholders as we step into this next phase of our recovery, development and growth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

93
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:16,780
好OK，咁誒，而家我讀一讀誒，我哋所有嘅委員嘅問題問題嘅次序啦，係周文港議員、林建峯議員、林少露議員、陸仲雄議員、田北辰議員、蘇蔣榮議員、黃俊石議員、陳少雄議員、姚柏良議員、林新強議員、李慧雲議員、嚴江議員。

94
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:48,130
好，嗯，周文廣議員，唔該，係多謝主席。見到而家迪士尼樂園咧，就係都係維持喺每週五日嘅有限度服務。咁咧，唔知係因為人手問題啊，定係其他考慮？因為而家內地遊客都蜂擁而嚟啦，而我哋可能有生意都做唔到。咁呢方面咧，唔知點解決？第二樣嘢咧。

95
00:14:48,130 --> 00:15:08,140
其實睇到迪士尼咧，二零一七年開始咧已經獲得咗股東同意注資一百零九億，但係咧見到佢唔同嘅項目咧，其實喺個落成時間上邊咧經常性出現延誤。我係想知道咧，而家佢啲錢方面啊，或者啲項目方面，而家嗰個最新嘅進展啊，以致到好多迪士尼迷。

96
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:33,750
最後一樣嘢咧，增加迪士尼嘅收入都好重要。我見到咧就誒喺個園區嘅電商平台入邊啊，個銷售唔知個情況係點樣樣咧。同埋佢一個好奇怪現象就係佢入邊咧喺個網頁入邊有條咧就話買完喺電商買完之後咧係要去現場攞嘅噉樣樣。我唔知呢個情況咧係。

97
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,460
demand.

98
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,660
Okay，Marvel。

99
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,030
Okay, Michael. Mr. Chairman.

100
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,500
If I could, Mr. Chairman, address the question.

101
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,080
As it relates to the overall expansion, we're very excited that.

102
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:20,860
With the results of the expansion so far, the Moana stage show is doing well. Of course, the Castle of Magical Dreams.

103
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:45,310
In operations that that really suits the demand, as it relates to the the overall workforce.

104
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:30,190
In Hong Kong, or they could pick it up in the park. It really is up to the guest at that point. It's been a popular feature of the website.

105
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:34,100
has been a wonderful addition to the park and a symbol of hope, really a symbol of the transformation the park has had over the last 15 years.

106
00:18:52,390 --> 00:19:08,120
Still quite unknown, and make a recommendation on the timing once we know a little bit more about our recovery. Meanwhile, I think World of Frozen is going to be a fantastic addition to to the resort, and Hong Kong is going to be proud of it.

107
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:16,330
Thank you for the questions. As it relates to our five-day operations, we're looking at the market situation every day to to gauge the demand. Right now, we are keeping our our park open between five and seven days, depending on that demand. Beginning.

108
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:36,340
As it relates to our operations, we are seven days at the Disneyland Hotel, the Explorers Lodge, and beginning in mid June, we're going to be opening the park six to seven days. We're going to continue to watch the market situation and go for.

109
00:16:45,730 --> 00:17:05,740
We are currently right now hiring. We're looking for you know over a thousand new cast members to help support the demand and our expansion throughout the the rest of the year. And we're hiring right now. However, our operations are really determined based on the the.

110
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:54,390
In the world of frozen, of course, is coming up this year. As it relates to future expansion beyond that, we have to remember that we're just out of the COVID lockdown and we really need to take a look at the pace of our recovery for when we move forward with the expansion.

111
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:18,790
If if I understand the question correctly, we have functionality on our e-commerce site for guests to be able to purchase merchandise at home through our website, and those guests have the option then to either have those goods delivered to your house.

112
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:52,390
As it relates to the Marvel, the Marvel expansion. Yes, yes. We are right now. Our focus is to make sure that we open up the world of Frozen properly. I think my advice to the shareholders is going to be to to gauge the pace of the of the recovery, which is still.

113
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,950
香港旅遊業界。

114
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,650
誒維持。

115
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,080
好，唔該，麥麥克，please。

夜間時spectacular momentous， but moreover， what we're seeing is good results， while

117
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:40,380
迪士尼園嗰個生意嘅，噉啊，我亦都好高興就話聽到啊，總裁講咧，就響呢個疫情期間咧，佢哋係保持原有啊員工嘅工作，咁亦都做咗一啲支援社會嘅工作。

118
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:15,550
可以刺激本港市場啊，包括利用佢佢哋嘅品牌效應啊啊等等。咁另外咧，噉我亦都想問一問迪士尼園咧啊，佢哋通關之後咧有冇做過一個統統計？

119
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:23,830
thank you好下一位誒林健鋒議員，嗯都係主席誒大家都知道啦，響疫情期間啦，香港嘅遊客係大減嘅，咁誒政府咧亦都為迪士尼園咧補貼咗唔少嘅營運誒資金。

120
00:19:40,660 --> 00:20:00,670
咁呢啲值得我哋支持嘅。咁而家疫情過後啦，啊，國內同海外嘅遊客咧都再次嚟講啦。噉我想問一問樂園未來用啲乜嘢方式嚟到吸引啊遊客嚟香港，吸引香港嘅旅客用多啲呢個呢個樂園點樣？

121
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:35,840
啊！樂園啊，帶嚟嘅收入嘅旅客咧，嗰個比例即係香港啊、啊國內啊、啊其他地方啊，咁邊一類係比較多啲唔多嘅？同疫情之前比較個變化又有啲乜嘢咧？噉啊，迪士尼響收入平衡平衡嗰方邊咧？

122
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:55,900
我相信我今日問你咧都係太早㗎啦，但係咧，即係我哋都要有個預算㗎。你哋會點樣？如果真係去到年尾，今年有錢賺啦，點點樣去利用多一啲啲依啲嘅盈餘咧，進一步去誒強化誒依個樂園同埋吸引遊客咧？多謝主席。好，唔該。

123
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:15,910
好啊！誒，或者喺吸引遊客嗰度咧，我哋當然會同迪士尼一齊合作啦，去做好呢方面嘅工作。迪士尼本身係一個品牌咧，亦都有一定嘅吸引力，所以大家見到我哋做推廣旅遊嘅時候咧，迪士尼誒或者加埋其他海洋公園啊等等，都會成為我哋吸引旅客嘅一啲嘅嘅誒。

124
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:35,920
方法啦，誒其他有關運作嗰啲，或者我請阿Michael去去打達。好，咁阿阿主席啊，既然誒局長講到話，即係佢哋會利用香港其他嘅品牌一齊聯合去推廣啦。咁或者如果有時間嘅，可唔可以講多啲咁多？即係用啲乜嘢方法咧？啊，將依幾個咁好嘅品。

125
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:55,930
排誒嗱，其實誒我驚，我驚一間未未必夠時間。不過好快打，即係我哋喺我哋嘅推廣裏邊咧。誒，因為我哋都睇到我哋嘅旅客，其實佢哋都係希望有多元嘅一個旅遊嘅體驗。咁迪士尼固然係一個樂園咧，作為本身有一定嘅吸引力。但係，譬如我哋會同埋，譬如海洋公

126
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,090
重新平衡嘅收支。

127
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,250
平衡到個收支。

128
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,330
下一條問題，誒下下一位，誒林少龍議員。

129
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,380
依盤生意，我睇曬所有文件，冇講到畀我哋聽幾時，冇講話賺大錢。

130
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,740
噉我想問嗰個問題咧，就係嗱，如果樂園係一個商業嘅營運嚟講，

131
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,420
Jeffrey's asking for, by submission maybe, by by by submission. Okay, we can do that. Yes.

132
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:42,950
多咧就令到誒，起碼咧蝕少咗噉樣嚇。呢個係我得到嘅信息。

133
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:13,450
在公園和酒店，他們正在享受像迪士尼的Premier Access，這是一個付費的優待產品。

134
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:52,700
但係現實嚟講，你睇翻二零零五年開源至今嘅三年咧，係正數嘅啫，其他全部係蝕錢嘅。

135
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:44,330
是飛機容量來回。在勞動節，我們的陸上客源回到2019年水平，特別是從廣東，和香港。如你所知，只有60%。

136
00:24:50,210 --> 00:25:05,350
Okay, I think you, especially you can provide us the profile breakdown by the like mainland, overseas, the type of change, whether is a how how does it compare to two thousand eighteen, two thousand nineteen? That that's what I think.

137
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:49,670
We have enjoyed record high Magic Access membership during the fiscal year, more than double of 2019. So I think we're positioned well for the recovery right now, and we're already seeing very strong strong results.

138
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:15,940
院啊，嗰啲我哋變咗有多啲。我哋做宣傳嘅時候咧，係容許我哋有多啲嘅選擇，去畀我哋喺外地或者內地嚟嘅旅客咧嚟到嘅時候，佢可以各色其色揀自己中意嘅嘢去做。咁當然迪士尼亦都會做好多宣傳去吸引嚟到香港嘅旅客去迪士尼嗰度玩嚇。

139
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:38,470
Thank, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it relates to our activities to reignite tourism around the border, one of the first things we did was really be the first to open up the the the boundaries. We were in the mainland talking with our partners, reigniting the industries. We've partnered with the

140
00:22:40,360 --> 00:23:00,370
And we've also held events. We were the first to hold a mainland China travel summit with all the the leaders there, really showing everyone what we have. And what we have is is is quite a lot considering that a lot of tourists haven't seen the Castle of Magical Dreams, our new.

141
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:29,470
not prepared to talk about our financial results for this fiscal year. What I can tell you is that Easter, we have seen Southeast Asia attendance back to 2019 levels. Many people from the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, and our penetration of those arrivals is even higher than 19. All we

142
00:23:44,610 --> 00:24:04,620
The other thing, question you asked about the tourist, we're seeing a new tourist behaviour emerge. Really more sophisticated. They're like they're looking for experiential and premium products, and that fits well with our positioning at Hong Kong Disneyland. And of course, we're seeing them spend more.

143
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:33,880
And we're also encouraged to see that locals are still travelling, even when they're not travelling outside of Hong Kong, they're still coming to the park. Of course, when the weather is good, so we are enjoying that. And one other point as it relates to locals, I mentioned in the in the upfront.

144
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,710
度。

145
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,480
啊！

146
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,980
誒。

147
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,220
誒對比。

148
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,440
我亦都想知道咧，就係。

149
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,670
佢哋嗰個財務個表現。

150
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,320
第二樣嘢，如果依個係一個旅遊基建嘅話，

151
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,640
國際上邊或者世界上邊其他嘅迪士尼園區？

152
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,640
嗱，以往我哋投資咗咁多年啦，誒，好長時間嘅虧蝕。

153
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,890
究竟嚟緊，尤其是我哋嘅財務誒環境，我哋財政儲備已經係冇以前咁好。

154
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:32,450
來年或者再往後，我哋嘅財政儲備係咪要有啲咩預算咧？係咪繼續補貼咧？噉樣？

155
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:06,790
經濟帶動對誒人青年人，畀佢有一個就業嘅機會，畀一啲有藝術或者係希望喺娛樂業發展嘅，亦都畀到一啲機會畀佢。咁呢啲係我哋喺成個考慮迪士尼或者而家嗰個表現嘅時候，我哋整體嘅考慮。

156
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:35,620
主席就無論睇文件又好，或者頭誒頭先聽誒樂園嘅代表去展述咧，就即係過往幾年嗰個誒表現差咧，係主要因為疫情啊。誒亦都係咧誒樂園或者政府方面都投入好。

157
00:26:48,250 --> 00:27:08,260
對比香港係一個咩情況咧？如果依個未有答案嘅話，我希望可以會後畀翻個資料我哋。多謝主席。好唔該，局長。誒，主席就誒喺個迪士尼嘅運作間，我請阿Michael打一打。但係從誒政府嘅角度咧，我哋投入去誒喺二零零五年迪士尼開嘅時候，或者資

158
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:28,270
之前我同佢傾嘅時候咧，其實係一個即係好重要對香港嚟講，尤其是喺嗰個時候咧，我哋係點樣帶動或者重新去畀我哋成個旅遊業有一個新嘅一個景點去做。咁誒，正話譬如誒，大家如果睇到迪士尼正話畀嘅其中一張slide都有講。

159
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,920
嚇！一個即係大家畀人一個發夢嘅地方嚟嘅，其實係。

160
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:34,050
噉我覺得發夢咧就唔一定係發即係西式嘅夢啊，係咪？咁有冇可以加入一啲嘅中國嘅元素啊、香港嘅元素啦？我見咧上海迪士尼咧就比較多中式嘅元素嘅。

161
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:41,420
見到喺個財政上邊係有係有一定嘅嘅誒增長喺度。咁至於公司嗰個情況，或者我請阿Michael答一答誒。Michael，can you comment on the breakeven possibility or the assessment？Yes，thank you，Mr. Chairman。

162
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:34,770
噉啊，其中一個問責咧，同埋增加透明度咧，就係我就發現咧，我係抄唔到咧香港迪士尼高層嘅相關嘅薪金同埋一啲花紅啊嘅數據嘅。

163
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:20,000
香港個經濟啊、旅遊業啊，有個正外部效應嘅嚇，就唔係淨係應該睇嗰個帳面嘅暫時嘅，但係咧唔睇都唔得嘅。O.K.噉啊誒，過去嘅財政年度咧就蝕咗廿一億，噉啊EBITDA咧都蝕咗八點六億。

164
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:14,610
有冇一個相關嘅監管嘅機制？呢班嘅高層係咩表現之下可以獲得乜嘢嘅酬金同埋獎金咧？我想問一問呢個關於管治嘅問題。另外一個咧就可持續發展嘅角度啦。噉啊，迪士尼其實個最大嘅主題就係夢幻。

165
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:49,000
由開源到而家，佢嗰個GDP嘅投入，即係對嗰個經濟嘅帶動，去到一千一百六十一億，如果我冇記錯嘅話，大約係我哋GDP嘅零點三個百分比。咁呢個本身唔係淨係睇個源本身究竟賺錢定蝕錢，而係我哋睇成個對成個經濟嘅帶動，除咗經。

166
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:27,080
迪士尼本身，如果大家睇翻，正如正係議員所講，佢開頭嗰段時間其實係未能夠達至收支平衡。但喺疫情之前嗰三年咧，的確係見到佢嗰個嗰個財政係有一滴嘅進步喺度。噉啊，當然而家誒冇人可以知，即係話如果冇疫情會點啦。咁但係的確，我哋。

167
00:28:41,700 --> 00:29:01,710
So I think it's important to keep in mind that the recovery really is just a few months old right now, and we're still learning about the pace of our recovery and how how fast that will go. I think some forecasts are that air flight capacity will only be seventy percent at the end of this calendar year, and of course.

168
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:21,720
our attendance from Southeast Asia and North Asia is very dependent on that, and so I think our recovery is largely dependent on the recovery of the overall industry and the overall market. What I can say this is that, as I mentioned earlier, we are doing better than the market right now. We just need for the

169
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:41,730
market to get better. I can also say that we have used our time and resources wisely. I believe during COVID, we have kept our costs down and we're going to continue to be prudent in managing our costs as as we look into the recovery. I think we have some reasons to be optimistic.

170
00:29:41,730 --> 00:30:01,740
主席，唔好意思，誒，我頭先講，我想要佢哋香港對比。

171
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,260
好。

172
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,380
shareholder咧，即係作為一個投資者。

173
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:14,750
to make sure that they have access, and and we have targets to to improve.

174
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:53,660
As our resort continues to mature, more and more of what is unique about Hong Kong will will come through.

175
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:25,260
those, finally, I'd like to thank you for being a Magic Access holder, and as it relates to our plans to include more Hong Kong elements.

176
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:05,920
好，嗯，啲時間都用得比較長，所以儘量大家誒，委員都係儘量keep住分半鐘，咁回回應嗰度儘量keep住分半鐘，好唔好啊？唔該，係田北辰議員，唔該。

177
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:31,100
Solar farm in Hong Kong, and we're actually planning on expanding that by 40% this year. As we contribute, we also have programs for recycling food.

178
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:47,930
and and food donations to limit waste as well as food for for energy. In addition, we are very focused on the sustainability of the food we serve and the products that that we make.

179
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:21,750
畀其他地方係嘛？Michael，can you please give us a written submission on the comparison between among all those Disney theme parks how they perform compared to us post COVID? I don't have access to all of the other theme parks. I think later on, public information, given the public information.

180
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:41,760
Certainly, yeah. I think what I can say is that the theme parks around the world, you know, where the markets have opened up, they've they've recovered fully in the United States and in and in Europe. Yeah, let's just work on a written submission for whatever you can provide.

181
00:30:41,760 --> 00:31:01,770
O.K.好，下一位係陸仲紅議員。誒，多謝主席。誒，小新報啦，我屋企人咧都有買迪士尼嘅年票嘅，噉我啊陪佢哋去啊嚇，冇佢哋去得咁多，平均都差唔多一年去到一次嘅。咁所以咧，對於迪士尼咧都係一個都幾經常嘅用家。噉我都理解咧，迪士尼作為旅遊基建咧，對香。

182
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:55,060
噉，我覺得呢方面係咪應該要增加透明度，大家都有個問責咧？因為畢竟咧，迪士尼香港迪士尼樂園咧，政府佔五十二個percent嘅大股東嚟㗎嘛，即係市民嘅大股東嚟㗎嘛。咁啲高層出幾千糧，我哋都應該起埋個支持啦。其次咧，就係政府。

183
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:54,340
咁香港嘅迪士尼有冇呢方面嘅計劃咧？譬如迪士尼都有個I.P係即係花木蘭啦，係嘛中中國嘅古仔嚟嘅。咁有冇啲香港元素可以加入咧？除咗呃人名嗰個之外，最後咧就係誒本地就業同埋採購方面咧，有冇啲乜嘢嘅優先？特別係用翻我哋本。

184
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:14,350
地嘅設計師，誒本地嘅民創嘅團隊去做翻誒迪士尼裏邊相關嘅工作。唔該，主席。好，唔該，我諗誒局方盡盡量盡盡盡簡單，我講一講嗰個誒嗰個喺即係作為政府作為一個誒即係。

185
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:36,670
我哋喺嗰個管理上邊，而家香港迪士尼係間獨立嘅公司啦。我哋作為投資者，我哋有誒，我哋官員係坐喺佢嗰個管理上邊咧，係喺個board裏邊咧，喺個董事會裏邊咧，係睇佢誒日常嘅運作嘅。咁但係因為呢個亦都冇一個我哋所謂嘅恆常嘅資助畀佢，大家會。

186
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:56,680
會見到其實我哋投入咗一次個投入咗一個誒一一個資本嘅投入之後，只不過係每一次如果需要有更加多資本投入去起一啲新嘅園區嘅時候，我哋先再需要去作為一個投資嘅啫。咁所以喺個日常運作裏邊，我哋會有監管，我哋都會睇住，但係有啲所謂嘅誒。

187
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:16,690
公開資訊嘅要求咧，我哋就要跟翻即係香港個公司嗰個即係公司法嘅做法，同埋即係因為佢亦都係誒美國迪士尼嘅誒，佢係上市公司嘅一部分咧。咁所以有啲誒佢裏邊嘅誒條例啊，或者規矩，我哋都要跟翻嘅。主席，反而美國迪士尼嘅高層。

188
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,830
第二。

189
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,460
多謝主席。

190
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,060
不過係咪真係你叻曬咧？

191
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,150
如果總收入起五億，營運成本起四億咧？

192
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,560
你追一百年啊！一百年都唔會收支平衡。

193
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,720
無論你蝕幾多都照收，咁呢樣嘢我不嬲都揞住，覺得好離譜。

194
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:02,170
到二二係咪都係升廿二？如果佢升三廿幾，你就真係好渣啦。如果佢升十幾，你就好叻啦嚇。我到時話你聽。

195
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:46,490
喺呢咁多年咧，迪士尼專利費就從來冇減過，七點五個percent年年照收。

196
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:12,950
但係咧，我而家最關注就由二一到二二咧，你個總收入就起咗五點三億，但係呢個營運成本就起咗四點二億啦。呢個好麻麻嘅。

197
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:36,890
過去八年咧，我哋係虧蝕嘅。當然最近三年就情有可原啦，係天災啦。但係之前嗰五年咧，就其實就係唔係天災。

198
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:24,180
我有兩個問題，第一個問題咧，我就希望啊政府誒回應，政府回應唔到，我希望迪士尼回應，兩個都冇咧，噉啊你遲早都要誒畀submission，應該唔使。第二咧，就應該就迪士尼先答得到啦。嗱，第一個問題。

199
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:10,140
不過我哋簽咗個噉嘅條約，噉啊冇得講啦。我只不過想請問下全世界迪士尼有冇試過喺專利費嗰度某一年某一個地方作出讓步，因為當地有啲好特殊嘅情況。我淨想知呢一點啫。

200
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:31,920
睇由二一到二二年咧，誒嗱，首先呢度咧，我要讚一讚迪士尼㗎嚇。疫情之下咧，你哋竟然二二年咧嗰個本地嘅人數啊，可以創開幕以嚟嘅新高，升成廿二個percent。嗱，呢樣嘢係難得嘅，我相信你做到好多嘢。

201
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:36,700
層咧，我話炒到佢嘅薪酬啊，同埋花紅喎。香港迪士尼我我哋係唔知政府又係大股東噉啊。局長兜咗一個圈之後咧，其實你第一你知唔知啦？第二你有有冇機制？第三有冇透明度？市民可唔可以知得到？誒，第一我哋係知嘅，我哋作為即係嗰個。

202
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:56,710
個誒管理嗰個董事局，我哋知道即係誒嗰個大致上嘅安排同埋個機制管理係點誒。至於係咪一個誒誒，即係需要去去去公開即係迪士尼嘅咧？誒，我我只可以話而家咧，我我暫時睇唔到有噉嘅需要喺度。

203
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:17,550
唔該，嗯，後面第二個係關於誒sustainability同埋嗰個誒本地採購，或者請Michael just be brief on on those two areas. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are from a sustainability standpoint, we're proud of our record. In fact, we have the largest

204
00:35:48,210 --> 00:36:08,220
as it relates to procurement, we have a strong local focus. In fact, we are championing several procurement initiatives in Hong Kong to support under-served groups such as women-owned and minority-owned businesses.

205
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:45,550
I think it's important to make sure that we are absolutely positioned as Hong Kong's park. We do that in our food, in our merchandise styles, and the the types of costumes that we wear that differentiate ourselves from Shanghai or Tokyo or even the the US parks. And so I think as as

206
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:55,350
噉啊，因為舊年咧就解封啊嘛，係咪？咁於是乎就好多人都出嚟噉啊，周圍消費咁咪一定去迪士尼啦。咁所以你哋將來即係我未而家下判斷，你到底係咪咁叻？我要睇睇海洋公園嗰個本地入場人數以一。

207
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:41,850
噉，但我又估計咧，你二一年係咪有一啲開支啊？係減省咗，可能有啲特殊性嘅開支減省咗。如果你減翻嗰筆數出嚟咧，其實你二一年其實個開支就唔止二廿六點八六，應該高啲嘅。咁咧就似樣啲啦。噉你即係你總收入。

208
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,230
誒。

209
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,000
Michael，please。

210
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,340
Why do you have to have me ask?

211
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,330
我諗集中答到呢個問題先啦。

212
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,740
一千年都追唔翻，而家我就問你呢個問題啊嘛！

213
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,160
延期收嗰個royalty嘅嗰個專利費嚇。第二個問題，我請威哥答。

214
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,200
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it relates to the local attendance, what we are seeing right now is that

215
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:54,770
所以令到你二零二二年不可減省，所以你嘅營運成本起成四億。

216
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:02,030
因為你如果係收入起五億，營運成本起四億，你一八年啊，你都追唔翻呢條數。

217
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:21,450
over 21，that's correct。okay，so in that case，I think you did a pretty good job in cost control。thank you。you can put that in the paper。let us know。

218
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:47,900
因為時間問題，你可唔可以答我個問題啫？二零二一年個廿六億係咪有啲嘢減省咗？

219
00:39:41,850 --> 00:40:01,860
加五億咧，你營運成本可能加一二億啊，噉樣樣就唔係四億。咁呢個要問你個細節。而一年有冇啲特別成本減省咗？係二二年減省唔到嘅兩個問題。好唔該，誒好簡單。第一個問題喺誒二零二二年嘅財政年度咧，香港迪士尼係暫緩咗收嗰個誒。

220
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:37,490
三出四香港人相信，香港迪士尼樂園是個地方嚟慶祝，和在任何一天在公園，一齣四係嚟慶祝生日和週年，畢業，和所以，我認為什麼我們現在看到的是，香港香港人有。

221
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:32,430
Okay, I'm sorry. I was asking the question is, was our local attendance? No, it's about your operating expenses. Okay, the third question was about the operating expenses, and during last fiscal year, our cost did go up 418 million Hong Kong dollars.

222
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:52,440
and a large from the prior year, a big part of that was that in the prior fiscal year we had the benefits of the employee support scheme from the Hong Kong government, which is approximately one hundred and fifty million dollars. Okay, one hundred and fifty million. In addition to that, we also had.

223
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:12,450
How much was that? It was more than the one hundred and fifty million dollars. So all together, it's almost over three hundred million. It was over three hundred. You have to incur in twenty two.

224
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:43,920
Anyway，啊，主席多謝你。我我好快想問問啊，局長，你正話話我哋今年唔使畀專利費啊？我延遲咗。咁延遲咗係咪都要畀㗎？誒，如果個個誒主席，如果個財政去翻一個即係可以嘅，我哋都要畀嚇。其實唔知幾時。最終嗰個都係跟跟翻嗰個合約做事。哦，即係咁呢？

225
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,010
誒，多謝主席。

226
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,280
二零二一年。

227
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,130
而一年咧就縮到去五千人。

228
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,490
誒，我好同意。

229
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,860
比較二零年咧。

230
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,890
吸引遊客嚟香港等等。

231
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,110
變成係一個膽嚟嘅啦，所以咧就。

232
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,650
兼職咧，千百人咧縮到去。

233
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,130
誒，今日以嗰個迪士尼嘅事情。

234
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:05,420
誒，正話阿局長喺回答其他議員嘅問題嘅時候話咧，就將。

235
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:26,760
請嘅人咧就原來係五千三人嘅正職嘅，但係。

236
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:13,440
誒嗰個旅遊文化建設咧，就同海洋公園嗰啲串埋一齊嚟考慮，我同意嘅。但係咧，以事論事。

237
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:14,970
先係確保佢嘅運營質量同埋吸引力，所以我有兩個問題我想問下嘅，一個咧就係誒，我發現咧就。

238
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:57,340
個即係佢哋都話好畀面嘅啦，因為佢哋年年都收嘅嘛。好啦，我諗係睇實際需要啦，嚇，即係大家都係想做嗰件事。哦，我希望唔使收啦，我哋食得好金，廿幾億，拜託你啦嚇。好，唔該，下位蘇長榮義。

239
00:43:46,190 --> 00:44:05,320
迪士尼樂園唔能夠簡單以賺錢賺錢或者賺錢幾多嚟衡量，佢佢確實係香港一個好需要存存在而且係發揮作用嘅噉樣嘅一個基建。所以咧，我所係關心咧就係即係點樣。

240
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,270
second question。

241
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,580
去更有特色。

242
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,290
咁第二個咧就，我今天已經疫情開放。

243
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,800
來源咧保唔保障到，即係個員工能夠提供充望充分服務，保唔保障到？

244
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:03,540
proposition going forward as one of the you know

245
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:31,640
新 cast members， as I mentioned earlier， we're looking to hire over a thousand right now for our recovery and expansion。

246
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,980
因為接落嚟咧就大量遊客入嚟啦，我就唔知道有關嘅職位。

247
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:12,290
我好好想知道誒，究竟海管理層裏邊或者係個企業嘅定位策略有咩辦法？

248
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:23,300
入到香港，和，作為我提到的聖誕節和五月黃金週，我們已經看到積極的跡象。黃俊石議員。

249
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:24,890
更有差異性，吸引同呢個上海迪士尼競爭，同橫琴嗰個長隆樂園競爭，使。

250
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,680
誒千二人，噉我就唔知道究竟係疫情嘅影響，定係嗰啲人自動離職，定係你哋為咗縮皮誒去減省人手。

251
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:36,460
我哋嘅迪士尼樂園更有吸引力，可能可以提高佢嘅有關收益。多謝。好，我哋壓住或者我請阿Michael。好，Michael，be brief please。

252
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:36,640
而家咧，對於迪士尼誒呢個海洋公園嘅傳費以下，以及咧就下一步點樣搞咧，政府同埋各界都各懷心事，咁所以變成迪士尼樂園咧喺旅遊文化建設，包括吸引嗰個遊客嘅。

253
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:56,920
Okay, thank you. As it relates to our cast members, we over the past three years we have not laid any cast members off. Any change in our overall cast member base has been a result of of natural attrition, other words their their decision. As it relates to our

254
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:24,190
We're a popular destination. We've been recognised as a top employer in Hong Kong, and we've been fortunate that we've been able to hire so far. Although I do have to acknowledge that the job market is is very challenging right now, and we have a number of tactics in place in the market right now to attract and retain.

255
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:53,680
As it relates to our overall competitiveness, I think you have to look at the differentiation between our product and the product that you might find in Shanghar, Shanghai or Chimalong. You know, we certainly have our own complement of products, and the guests who come here rate us highly. I think when you look at the lineup.

256
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,200
需要。

257
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,510
你生啲plant。

258
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,830
所以，作為 relates to our

259
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,650
overseas university graduates to come Hong Kong and work in the Hong Kong Disneyland Park.

260
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:50,290
係咁誒，即係完全係復常嘅時候啦，而遊客咁多嘅時候，五千個全職，千二個兼職。

261
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:20,060
法可以改善嚟緊呢個狀況，同埋幾時還錢畀政府？多謝主席。唔該，局長。或者請阿Michael。好，Michael please。

262
00:50:51,790 --> 00:51:01,660
哦，We could grow globally。我諗我哋，我你你畀我哋去facilitate啲問題好唔好啊？好，我哋因為問咗啦已經，我等佢哋答埋第另外啲事。

263
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:23,290
issue in Hong Kong, and we need to continue to work with universities and vocational schools to help make sure we're training Hong Kongers. Can I confirm how many people you have hired in the in the job fair in Fabri this year?s

264
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:13,690
new things that we have for guests who have not visited Hong Kong right now, we stand apart from I think anyone in the market. The Castle of Magical Dreams, the the stage show, the nighttime spectacular, momentous, and of course now the World of Frozen, our largest expansion yet. I think we have a lot to offer in bringing tourists.

265
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:44,050
好多謝主席。主席誒，我想跟進啱啱蘇展榮議員問嗰個問題嚇。咁其實即係局方都有答過話，而家都係會想去徵聘呢個職位，但係其實我哋都知道，成個香港而家都請又好睏難啦嚇。咁當然疫情期間嘅時候，可能迪士尼即係縮減咗營營運時間啊，或者嗰個誒日子嘅時候都應付到。而家佢我哋。

266
00:47:50,580 --> 00:48:10,590
真係未必夠噉。其實我哋點樣可以？雖然即係而家個part就係one of the more attractive employers in Hong Kong，但係我哋即係點樣可以吸引更加多唔同嘅人、年青人入行咧？依個第一個問題。第二個就係關於數字上嘅問題啦。噉我留意到依個誒折舊與攤分即係depreciation and amortisation咧，就下跌咗十四個。

267
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:30,600
個percent即係誒一點九四億噉。當然文件咧就話係誒，一係有好多嘅誒誒一啲嘅furniture fixtures啊，即係一啲嘅誒建築物啦，已經係誒完全地誒折舊所致嚇噉啊！亦都知道嚟緊有一啲新嘅建築誒會落成噉，我想問下咧，會對於我哋成個收益表income statement？

268
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:50,610
呢一個誒折舊與收益將會帶嚟嘅影響，雖然係冇冇現金流嘅影響，但係我哋都要知道個impact，誒即係個影響有幾多。第三個就留意到一個非流動資產入面咧，噉我哋即係嗰個嘅誒借貸啦，由二十億到上升到四十億。咁當然知道一個短期嘅資金嘅週轉。

269
00:48:51,660 --> 00:49:11,670
落完未必有一個誒直接嘅誒一個誒一個嘅利息嘅支出，或者係近乎冇啦嚇。咁但係問題就係我哋一個高嘅借貸，其實對於任何一個機構、有一間公司又好，甚至乎政府都唔係一個好嘅誒影響啦。因為一個咁高嘅leverage，噉我想問下有咩辦？

270
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:49,120
Our cast base, we are looking to hire a thousand people right now, and as one of the the top and most desired companies to work for in Hong Kong, I think we are fortunate that we are able to to get people to come to our job job expos. An example of this is in February, we

271
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:40,830
好，good。And I'm not certain that I got the translation correct on the third question. Non-current liabilities.

272
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:43,140
瞭解嗱，關於未來發展喺文件十三至第十七段咧，就有大約講咗下，但係點唔到題。

273
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:18,310
而中國內地訪客比例接近一半嘅，國際訪客大約就係二十百分之二十到啦，本地客就係三分之一。

274
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:32,500
That will go online next next fiscal year, and you'll see the impacts of that on next next fiscal year's financial statements.

275
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:53,480
嗱，翻查記錄，自動樂園開業以嚟，只有二零一二、二零二一四年三個年度錄得盈餘之外咧，其餘所有嘅年度都係虧損嘅。

276
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:33,680
Should we needed the liquidity? But we're in a position right now where you know we're recovering and seeing improvement. We haven't made any. The last draw we made on the

277
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:14,690
二零一九年因為黑暴事件，以及二零二零至二零二二年度受住新冠疫情嘅影響，呢啲特殊情況下，樂園嘅業績係錄得嘅虧損係可以理解嘅。

278
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:47,690
The revolver, which is the the cause of the change, which was 1.8 billion dollars at the end of last year. We haven't made a draw since then. So I think we're in a position

279
00:52:48,060 --> 00:53:01,670
to improve, and our focus is to to pay off our revolver and improve our financial standing. Okay, thank you, Michael.下一位陳少雄議員，唔該。多謝主席。

280
00:53:53,810 --> 00:54:09,600
頭先阿林兆龍議員就問咗我想問嘅問題，就係誒個盈虧平衡點啊點樣處理咧？咁噉我特別針對就係考慮到誒有盈利嗰幾年，二零一三至一零一四年度入場人次七百五十萬左右。

281
00:49:49,120 --> 00:50:09,130
had the the job expo for dream makers we hired three hundred people on the spot we've been fortunate to get people to come and to be able to hire again there's other tactics that we have in in place although we can't discount that there is a significant labour

282
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:43,590
So in the job fair in February this year, we hired three hundred on that day. There was a halo effect. We hired some more after that, but that's not unusual for a one day, you know, job job expo. Is there any plan that you would like to like? I mean, recruit some.

283
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:22,750
Okay, you have two more two more points on the depreciation amortisation and financing. Yes, as the as the the park matures, some assets will come off the the register. All the depreciation that's incurred is according to the accounting policy and is consistent from year over year. With World of Frozen

284
00:51:41,320 --> 00:52:01,330
The borrowing has been increased from two billions to four billions, and of course I understand that the park might probably enjoy low or even no interest borrowing from the government. But it's still not a good financial healthy position for the park to have such high borrowing. Is there any plan to increase?

285
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:21,340
I mean the equity portion or decrease the borrowing from the governments. No, right now, right now there's no no plans to ask Edgeco or either shareholder for any additional funds for operations. The Walt Disney Company upsized our revolver from 2.1 to 2.7 billion.

286
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:34,980
啊！主席啊，如果以迪士尼樂園嘅規模去做一份公司嘅週年年報，誒短短五頁紙嘅附件咧，我認為就唔合格嘅。嗱，大家關心嘅係咩咧？就係未來發展嘅展望，如何讓市民大眾對於前景啊，誒樂園嘅前景有所。

287
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:38,690
噉我想政府連同迪士尼真係對於你會後提供書面回應嘅時候，特登針對一啲重要嘅數據，例如話你哋未來嘅展望，即係話有幾多嘅入場人次？誒而喺入入場人次入邊，中國內地訪客比例同埋本地訪客比例嘅組合係幾多咧？咁如果要想

288
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:58,700
超越呢個盈虧平衡點，誒以達至轉虧為盈嘅目標，有啲乜嘢要做咧？咁嗱，主席。此外咧，其實我哋所瞭解就係話攞住呢個迪士尼樂園作為一個誒生意去管理嘅話，迪士尼嘅固定成本咧其實基本穩定嘅，但係多一個入場人士嘅編製成本就好低嘅。

289
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,140
水平。

290
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,020
Michael，please。

291
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:08,630
誒誒，利潤畀我，作為我個我個回回報。誒，但係同樣地。

292
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:36,810
一對迪士尼有信心啦，即係誒過去大家如果睇佢嘅成績，見到喺一困難時候，佢仍然能夠堅持到。

293
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:41,520
privilege product, our hotel rates as as well as food and merchandise to make sure that we are optimising our profit potential for that next guest, as as you mentioned.

294
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:32,760
例如話，現時嗰個標準嘅票價大約係七百蚊咁上下，個價格嘅敏感度有冇做過分析咧？我哋畀佢畀佢哋答好啊！唔該，唔該，局長。好啊，或者我請阿阿Michael答啊。好。

295
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:50,610
Yes, as it relates to the mix of attendance that we're seeing. Oh, sorry, let me let me interrupt. If there if you already answer part of those questions, you just just just add on. You don't need to repeat, please. Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

296
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:18,710
因此，編制收入同埋利潤咧多咗一個入場人士就可以增加，從而影響整體嘅盈利。咁所以，我第二個問題就係入場費嘅收費啊，係會影響咗入場人次。就除除咗樂園提供所謂誒年票啊、套票之外咧，有冇檢討過個入場嘅收費？

297
00:55:50,940 --> 00:56:10,950
So as it relates to our aspirational goals for mix of tourists going forward, we'd like to see you know roughly an equal mix of of local mainland and in international attendants. Although that is it's going to be some time for the recovery in order for that to happen.

298
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:31,060
作為relates to our ticket costs， we have added two new tiers to our ticket pro， costs to take it up， and we're going to continue to look at our pricing not just on our main gate but， but other products such as Disney's Premier Access which is a pay per。

299
00:56:41,820 --> 00:57:01,830
好，主席，我好想補發根據一點咧，就話即係作為一個負責任嘅政府，應該係要考慮到即係過往嗰兩三年嘅情況之餘，仲係要展望將來，即係點樣可以確保樂園嘅持續發展，而又從而咧增加到香港整體個經濟嗰個嗰個即係發展。

300
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:21,840
嘅嘢噉，所以我覺得政府應該有個態度，就即係譬如話頭先，我哋幾位議員都問你認為樂園擔當咗咩重要角色？如果佢蝕錢唔緊要，但係蝕錢之餘係成個嘅經濟嘅誒所謂嘅增長點同埋個乘數效應係得到，我哋想聽一聽呢一類嘅即係政府嘅表態。唔該，主席。誒，政府補充下。主席。

301
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:41,850
主要好簡單嘅啫，即係其實過去樂園咁多年咧，唔係年年都蝕錢嘅，曾經試過賺錢嘅，噉我亦都將佢賺嘅錢咧，係投入翻咧去做佢更加多嘅建設，去將嗰個樂園更加發展。作為一間私人公司咧，佢冇可能唔希望賺錢嘅，即係對股東嚟講，即係固然。

302
00:57:41,850 --> 00:58:01,860
我哋香港嘅股東，外在政府嘅股東，我哋會大體啲去睇對成個經濟帶動到幾多，所以我哋唔係push，即係唔係逼佢每一年餵你都一定要賺一個一個幾多錢翻嚟，或者我哋唔係睇淨係呢間公司佢帶嚟嘅收益對政府，即係可以畀翻幾多。

303
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,540
誒，多謝主席。

304
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,020
increase their visitation.

305
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:23,020
通嘅噉，麻煩你哋再誒誒書面再交翻入嚟啦，好唔好？唔該，下一位葉柏良議員。

306
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:55,110
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it relates to the Greater Bay Area, you know they really are right at our back door, and it's a it's a big focus of ours. We we look that they could really

307
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:40,580
在前線嘅員工，咁誒呢個政府亦都係誒作緊一啲嘅思考研究咧，去睇下用用咩方法去解決。咁誒至於特別喺迪士尼嘅問題，或者我請阿阿Michael作答嚇。係啦，關於嗰個誒大灣區咧。

308
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:56,380
where GBA guests can come in for a short period of time and then head back home and enjoy those those events. Of course, we're excited about what the world of frozen will do when it opens up in November as well. It'll be a very strong draw for GBA guests.

309
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:28,920
另外一個股東作為美國嘅嘅公司，佢作為上市公司，佢亦都有一個壓力要去誒，需要有一個收益翻去畀佢。咁所以誒，我知道大家都見到啲數咧，係可能會擔心話啊，間公司會唔會長遠？餵你究竟想點做？我我覺得大家要對即係第一。

310
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:57,210
將嗰個虧損係收集喺過去一啲年份，佢仍然係佢係喺早喺二零一二年嗰陣時已經賺過錢噉，佢亦都願意投入翻落去做，繼續去去擴展，係表達咗佢對成個生意其實係有一個信心喺度。如果唔係，唔會再入去投資噉。所以從政府角，

311
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:17,220
度，我哋希望間公司係可以起碼做到收支平衡，有回報就係最好啦。呢個亦都係我哋希望可以做到。第二樣嘢就係話佢佢係能夠帶動到成個經濟，為香港嘅經濟發展咧係帶嚟一個正面嘅作用。好唔該，局長。噉我諗有關於嗰個展望將來，阿阿陳議員一路有講嘅。咁如果你哋仲有補充？

312
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:44,830
迪士尼樂園咧係一個非常之重要嘅，即係香港旅遊業嘅一個景點啦。噉啊，發展旅遊業，你需有吸入優質嘅景點去吸引旅客嚟香港。咁當然純粹睇盤數噉啊，係唔理想嘅嚇，係蝕緊錢。但係就即係對整體對吸客嚟講咧。

313
00:59:44,830 --> 01:00:04,840
一直都發揮住一個好重要嘅作用。噉我有幾幾幾點問題想問一問嘅，其實就即係頭先我哋好多議員都關注到啦，人手嘅問題。其實而家旅遊業真係人手短缺係一個好大嘅問題。噉啊，頭先元芳都回應議誒議員同事嘅時候，都講到佢哋都係即係誒喺呢方面都。

314
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:24,850
會加加大力度去招聘啦。咁但係就即係知道今年又會進一步擴展嘅誒，酒店亦都會再再開埋即係誒開裂活。咁喺呢方面嚟講，係咪有足夠嘅即係信心係可以能夠招募到人手咧？咁如果人人手呢方面局方又有冇啲咩嘅即係其他嘅措施可以能夠幫助業？

315
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:44,860
界咧呢度都想問一問。另外一個就係話誒迪士尼樂園其實喺疫情期間咧，即係喺本地市場呢度咧係做得相當之出色，真係係誒好多數字都創咗一個新高。咁呢個可喜嘅。咁但係就點樣可以用到呢方面嘅經驗去擴展到去整個大灣區嗱？迪士尼樂園如果純粹靠香港，

316
01:00:44,860 --> 01:01:04,870
講啲七百幾萬人口嘅市場嚟講咧，我諗呢盤生意係冇得做嘅。但係如果整體睇翻成個大灣區有成八千幾萬人口咧，呢個嘅潛力其實非常之巨大。所以即係點樣用翻喺香港呢個本地市場呢個經驗，去令到去做大灣區市場嘅時候咧，可以盡快去能夠吸納多啲大灣區嘅旅客嚟。

317
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:24,880
嚟香港入入樂園嚇，呢個我係想問嘅，同埋點樣去持續噉樣保持到一個競爭力？好，局長講句。主席喺人手上邊咧，其實我哋好多場合，成個政府都有都有講過，我哋完全誒明白，即係而家香港面對一啲誒人手短缺嘅問題，喺唔同嘅層面咧，包括。

318
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:18,450
Because of the great access that they have to Hong Kong. Not only that, but what we're finding right now is that there are a lot of Disney fans right across the border in the GBA. And so when we're looking at our attendance right now and our recovery so far, we're seeing that the GBA is our attendance from the GBA.

319
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:38,460
是是 recovering the fastest over one hundred percent of of prior year, so I think our focus is going to continue to be, you know, working with our travel trade partners and and making sure we have the right opportunities for those guests to to come into Hong Kong and continuing to provide strong special events.

320
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:16,760
好唔該，誒，我哋而家咧同我哋預計時間已經超過八分鐘，噉我哋仲有七位未問嘅，噉我就想攞大家嘅誒認可啦，我哋就將今日嘅會議延長多十五分鐘到啊十二點四十五，好唔好啊？唔該，咁繼續請大家儘量誒精。

321
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,520
佢曾經亦都有段時間咧，係曾經。

322
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:40,490
個意見都唔錯嘅，我覺得係都值得去做嘅，都值得去做嘅嚇。

323
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:32,460
個樂園能夠為香港整體帶嚟嗰個經濟收益同埋對嗰個就業個影響咧，係比較重視啲嘅嚇。好唔該，啊李慧文議員。

324
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:18,880
之前咧，政府咧喺迪士尼樂園東邊就做咗竹篙灣第二期嘅填海佔地咧，就六十公頃。原本咧就留畀迪士尼擴建嘅，但係最後尾咧就晒陽，就曬足十年，最後咧做咗隔離營。

325
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:36,770
揀啊！林生強議員唔該，主席。誒，我睇到迪士尼呢盤數咧就有啲嚇親嘅，基本上咧就係長期蝕本啊。繼續噉樣做落去咧，最多咧都係咧賺咧就賺粒糖，蝕就蝕間廠啊。誒，所以咧我睇落咧誒都係唔會賺錢㗎。就算啊，姚議員咧。

326
01:03:41,270 --> 01:04:01,280
但係呢個世界咧有危就有機嘅，我哋要想想新嘅辦法，睇下迪士尼點樣增加收入啊！我我嘅建議就係，喺迪士尼咧可以好似地鐵噉樣喺迪士尼樂園旁邊嘅竹篙灣興建迪士尼新市鎮啊，令迪士尼咧就轉規為營，增加咧新嘅旅遊景點啦，誒同埋咧又可以。

327
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:39,240
喺二零二二年，即係上年啦嚇。美國迪士尼咧就已經展開新業務啦，要喺咧加州興建具迪士尼風格嘅新市鎮啊。誒，所以咧我建議政府同迪士尼傾下，一齊咧去發展竹篙灣新市鎮。裡面咧就有商場啊、私樓啊、居屋。

328
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:59,250
啊，公屋啊，就有地鐵啊，都可以興建。而家政府咧研究緊話收翻高爾夫球場三十二公頃，最後咧就只係計劃用八公頃去起屋，都可以預計咧住三萬人。咁六十公頃嘅迪士尼新市鎮估計都可以住十萬人啩。噉我希望政府可以考慮一下。

329
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:19,260
意見多謝，局長。誒，當主席就誒喺誒，即係迪士尼旁邊嘅第二期用地咧。誒，其實而家政府都係誒作緊一啲研究咧，睇緊即係長遠個發展係點樣咧。咁誒，但係至於話即係就算真係正如阿阿林議員所，

330
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:39,270
講話要發展一啲大型嘅項目，究竟點樣發展法？係咪需要牽涉到迪士尼咧？誒，我哋呢個會長遠去去作一啲嘅考慮，因為已經完全唔係嗰回事㗎啦。即係已經係即係第二第二樣嘢，我哋點樣利用、點樣盡用嗰沓地去為社會帶嚟最大嘅益。

331
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:59,280
咁呢個係我哋即係作為政府要去考慮嘅一樣嘢。咁誒，我知道大家都好擔心誒，即係睇落去啲數迪士尼嗰個財政。咁誒，過去三年的確係令到好多迪士尼想做嘅嘢，或者佢原本有嘅發展咧，係受到一啲嘅嘅阻礙。咁誒，正如我所講，如果我哋睇翻前啲咧。

332
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:22,000
直情係賺過錢嘅，咁所以我諗誒睇多幾年，我哋睇佢個努力，我相信佢應該係會帶嚟到一啲即係誒即係令人滿意嘅成績啦。咁但係無論如何，從政府嘅角度作為一個誒其中一個誒誒即係投資者嘅角度咧，我哋係較睇咧佢成個。

333
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:52,890
主席，嗯，我理解即係對上嗰幾年嘅疫情咧，好好明顯帶嚟一個前所未有嘅一啲挑戰啦。噉啊，誒同時間亦都我諗好多議員都針誒誒聚焦喺嗰個財政上面問到好多唔同問題。噉啊誒，亦都知道迪士尼咧做好多即係誒支持本地誒個。

334
01:06:52,890 --> 01:07:12,900
經濟啊，同埋誒就業機會嘅一啲工作，噉啊，但係都亦都要提就係，因為啱啱都講到咧，即係誒文件所誒提供嗰啲資料係得三年有盈利。噉我我想少少從另外一個角度問咧，因為整體迪士尼作為誒美國一個上市公司咧，佢係有盈利嘅，佢係做得都唔錯嘅。

335
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,810
yes，thank you，Mr. Chairman。

336
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,070
增加房屋供應啦嚇！

337
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,630
好，咁下一位嚴光議員，多謝主席。

338
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,900
We'll continue to watch these market conditions and be prudent with our costs.

339
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,260
誒嗰個誒帶嚟一啲盈利咧，咁另外咧就。

340
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:01,640
China provinces, as it relates to our overall profitability.

341
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:46,960
市場唔該曬。嗯，呢兩個問題都問過，噉我諗我請局長同埋公司去補充，好冇？好快補充嚇，我請阿Michael好快補充嚇。

342
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:40,280
對於Disney咧，係疫情期間以及咧今年咧復常之後，支持咧社會慈善嘅行動咧，我首先咧表示充分嘅肯定嘅。

343
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:32,910
嘅業績各方面噉，所以即係有幾多程度係一個我哋自己，譬如話本本身管理嘅問題，或者香港誒存在嘅一啲嘅情況咧，而導致到個盈利唔理想咧。咁另外咧，亦都留意到喺誒嗰個文件入邊提提供嗰啲數據咧，喺個收入係一路有增加嘅，即係撇除咗嗰個疫情嘅時段。

344
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:52,920
啦嚇噉，甚至乎咧，即係去到差唔多六十億嘅一個收入嘅水平咧，但係仍然係冇盈利。但係咧，之前咧係去到唔夠五千億嘅一個誒收入嘅水平咧，都有盈利。所以中間係即係嚟嚟去都係開源節流啦。噉係咪嗰個支出嗰方面有啲乜嘢地方可以調整到，令到？

345
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:17,550
誒誒，啱啱都有議員提過，即係話誒同上海嚟比較啊，或者甚至乎誒姚柏玲議員都有講到大灣區個發展。我其實想多啲聽，我自己本本身就都認為係有誒香港有佢嗰個誒獨特嘅嗰個優勢嘅，而且同埋特特別係即係吸引一啲大灣區嘅客户係近。

346
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:37,560
啲啊，咁但係我想聽多少少就係個策略，你有啲乜嘢嘅推廣宣傳，甚至乎可能就咁睇翻嗰個內地嗰個誒啲遊客嚟到有幾多成分係咪好大嘅誒成分都已經喺大灣區或者係你哋有啲咩具體嘅計劃去做呢啲推廣同埋係誒宣傳去誒吸引呢個咁龐大嘅。

347
01:08:55,090 --> 01:09:15,100
As it relates to the publicity that we have going on right now in the Greater Bay Area, we have several campaigns. One, the Reignite the Magic, which is you know essentially our welcome back campaign for for guests, and we have out of home advertising and the high speed rails.

348
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:35,110
train stations etc. We've also engaged in a lot of publicity efforts to do the same. This summer we're going out with a larger campaign, really promoting what guests have not been able to see: our Newcastle and our nighttime spectacular in the GBA. Now within with

349
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:55,120
within that within our recovery right now we're absolutely seeing the the GBA recover faster it's largely because of access across the boundary both the buses and trains and high speed rail is is easier and has higher capacity than the airlines right now from the other

350
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:21,930
As I mentioned earlier, we are we are you know brand new into this recovery right now. We are watching our costs very carefully, and and you know we are you know we're doing better than the market, but the market needs to to do better right now, and.

351
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,030
嗯。

352
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:38,340
嗰三個先唔該，好或者我請阿Michael答咧嚇嗰啲數嘅嘢嚇。

353
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:27,520
是是，something to take into consideration as well as an inflation. But

354
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:37,670
你你知，我們你知，我們我們 no 錯過到 profitability， and 我們 eager to get back。 so the revolver loan comparing to the government loan。

355
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:32,060
少年咧生理康復嘅課程，如果咧呢個效果好嘅話咧，都建議咧可以涵順化嘅。多謝主席。好，局長，即係請阿Michael考慮一下嚇。

356
01:10:40,840 --> 01:11:00,850
咁咧呢度咧都想建議下Michael啊。誒，由於咧疫情嘅影響，咁咧本港嘅學生咧係其實面臨更加多嘅心理嘅問題嘅。對於呢啲患有心理障礙嘅青少年，誒青少年咧，可否Disney咧係今年暑假期間可以咧考慮？

357
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:20,930
同香港以及大灣區嘅相關機構咧聯手，去捐造一期針對心理疾病嘅青少年，可以係家長嘅陪同之下咧，係Disney嘅夏令營嘅。咁咧係歡樂開心嘅氣氛下咧，同心理輔導師義工一齊，可以提供一個有造於青少。

358
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:53,510
Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you may know, we do a lot of work with youth programs this year. Our youth programs enjoyed its biggest year ever last fiscal year, and we also work a lot with NGOs. And these are all good ideas, and we'll take these under advisement. Thank you.

359
01:11:53,510 --> 01:12:13,520
好，唔該。啊，下位啊，邱達根議員。誒，多謝主席。係，我先申報啦。我公司係有做娛樂行業嘅誒業務嘅。噉我幾條問題咧，不如我都可以希望好短嘅答案，因為我問嘅都好好大粒。噉你話譬如長期貸款啊，我哋呢個無抵押嘅長期貸款啦，係。

360
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:33,530
有啲係由迪士尼提供，有啲就係由香港政府提供嗰四十億。誒，我想知道咧，誒係咪兩邊畀嘅呢個貸款都係冇利息嘅？如果有利息，誒港府同埋迪士尼畀嘅呢個貸款有冇分別？係咪所收嘅息率都係一樣？

361
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:53,540
嘅咁頭先局長提到嗰個誒franchise fee啦，嗰嗰個誒defer咗一年，二零二一到二二咁遲收咗，但係歷史嚟會唔會計翻我哋利息喺遲收嘅部分，定係都係啊純粹遲收啫？收嘅款項都係一樣嘅，咁呢啲可以作答好短。咁另外咧。

362
01:12:53,540 --> 01:13:13,550
有個誒其他嘅問題就係誒，我諗每個遊樂場咧都會有啲測算嘅，就定期會計算自己個收支回報個點，即係我哋所謂break-even point啦。噉啊，頭先好多議員都係問幾時回本啫，但係我相信迪士尼一定有個測算，我哋個break-even point係邊度，即係幾多旅客噉。

363
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:33,560
我諗誒，可唔可以回答下我哋要幾多萬嘅旅客，我哋先做到呢個break even？我哋有冇呢個測算，定係你冇做，定係唔方便透露啊？咁呢個可以好快回答。噉啊，仲有啲好快嘅，噉就一啲我哋match幾個park之間嘅比例啦嚇。噉啊，其實。

364
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,100
OK，好，唔該。

365
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,670
But we we don't know about the market mix and how that that recovers.

366
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:16,310
我認為歷史數字係一個好嘅度量，

367
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,510
what what is the interest rate comparison? It's it's it's lower than.

368
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:51,070
我mean，我mean，the government loan，the government loan is is interest rate free or are are we charging the same interest rate as Disney or

369
01:18:44,580 --> 01:19:01,190
常年都唔開，噉佢哋都想理解翻點解咁耐都唔開，同埋呢個呢個呢個景點第二時個將來個發展係點樣？唔該，主席。好，咁三個問題咧：請人嘅難處，誒產品服務，同埋第三個係個森林區。啊，或者我請阿Michael。好，Michael官。

370
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:53,570
香港啊、日本啊、上海啊，我相信因為迪士尼都係一個股東啦，佢就可能唔方便誒head to head去比較。咁但係我喺媒體度睇咧，其實好多就會哦香港對日本嘅比較，香港對上海嘅比較。咁如果我哋喺中文嘅媒體度一般去睇咧，網上幾個平台咧，成日會將譬如香港同上海比較，噉啊土地。

371
01:13:53,570 --> 01:14:13,580
地就上海會大啲啦，咁個誒誒個塔可能個castle有上海六十米，香港廿三點五米，咁好多時候個媒體方面咧都會排上海嗰個咧優勝於香港。咁呢方面我哋點做咧？即係喺個媒體方面有好多呢啲head to head嘅比較，香港同上海，香港同日本。咁可能你公司又

372
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:33,590
要避免個競爭，噉就喺個媒體方面唔能夠咁主動咁去推廣香港，只能夠話：誒，我哋有新嘢啦，有新嘢啦。咁喺呢啲比較方面，係咪可以幫我哋爭取更加好嘅一啲媒體方面嘅比較咧？好。咁第四條問題其實佢哋誒局方係會交submission㗎啦。噉我諗嗰度就冇唔使答啦，淨係答咗前面。

373
01:14:41,450 --> 01:15:01,460
the the hotel loans are at a higher interest rate than the revolver loans. The revolver is three month high bor plus one two five, and I can get back to you on the on the bank loans, but they are higher. The royalty fees, which were deferred, are at

374
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:21,470
no interest rate, no no additional fees for the deferral, and as it relates to the the break even number, I think you can look at our historical attendance figures for proxies for what that break even attendance figure might be. Although I think the difference in guest spending from each origin.

375
01:15:52,100 --> 01:16:12,110
So the revolver is high bore plus one point two five. I know, but that's one is from Disney, right? I mean, the one from from government. The one from government, I believe, is high bore plus something higher than one point two five. I can get back to you exactly on that. And can we assume the breakeven point would be around seven million visitors? Can we assume that? You said from historical numbers.

376
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:44,520
下一位，容海欣議員。唔該，主席。誒噉，儘管係疫情期間咧，睇翻文件啦，迪士尼喺二零二二年嘅財政年度都為香港經濟帶嚟咗七億嘅誒港元嘅增加值嘅，係相等於本地生產嘅總值百分之零點零三。咁誒，亦都係即係睇翻過往啦，其實成。

377
01:16:44,520 --> 01:17:04,530
個業績咧，我哋都理解到誒個營運個問題，尤其是而家人手嗰方面。噉我亦都上網揾到啲資料啦，亦都係係有啲網民亦都係同我哋反映啦。誒係唔係而家個請人嗰方面係有困難咧？即係響個誒，即係過往啦，響響疫情期間，當然公司係要誒維持翻一定嘅。

378
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,800
Michael，please，any comments to add？

379
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,350
好，唔該，下一位誒，周浩鼎議員。

380
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:05,370
好，唔該。嗯，下一位李浩然議員。好多謝主席。

381
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:30,760
係佢哋喺屯門都可以做多啲招聘，因為我哋好多本區嘅屯門居民咧，我相信佢哋係樂意去到嗰度翻工嘅。好，唔該，好，局長。

382
01:22:49,220 --> 01:23:01,080
No, thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the suggestions for recruiting into Moon. It is a very popular place for our cast members to live, and and any support on bus 33 would be helpful to our cast. Thanks.

383
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:18,600
attraction， we've had to with COVID we've had to make a lot of a lot of changes， but we're happy to say that that will be coming along， you know later this calendar year， so thank you。

384
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:45,820
誒，我諗我哋會會考慮啊，議員嘅意見啦。誒，即係盡量我哋誒做到，即係幫到手，點樣去做，去盡量去做。或者我睇下Michael有冇嘢補充嚇。

385
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:24,540
誒人人人工喺度，或者係一啲嘅誒人喺度去經營、去維持翻成個樂園嘅嘅營運。咁所我想問翻咧，而家我哋逐步逐步係開放翻個樂園啦，想問翻而家喺個人手上面誒係咪面對一啲難處咧？咁誒，亦都係有啲網民咧，其實想我哋代問嘅，即係佢哋理解到而家樂園。

386
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:44,550
誒而家希希望可以係點樣提質提量誒，將個經濟或者係誒帶嚟畀香港多啲咧。但係佢都都希望個質個樂園嘅質素可以提高，包括係飲食上面，佢哋會認為係太太貴嘅，即係睇睇翻網上有一啲資料咧，一隻火雞比係一百六十蚊港幣，但係兩年前咧係九十八蚊港。

387
01:17:44,550 --> 01:18:04,560
幣誒比較喺東京咧係六十蚊港幣，即係佢哋會作出噉嘅比較，即係唔係話話啲咩？大家都係飲食一樽水係要三十蚊港幣。佢哋當然佢畀咗樂園嘅錢，佢哋都希望可以盡興咯。但係如果喺呢啲個價錢上面或者喺商品上面唔夠多元化咧，呢個亦都係對比喺其他嘅樂園咧，佢哋。

388
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:24,570
會有一個作出大嘅比較，就令到佢哋啊嚟到香港可能誒個個滿意度不足噉樣，咁會唔會喺響個質素提升同埋點樣去利用科技去排隊買嘢食啊？因為而家多數都係要真係自己落單買嘅。喺美國佢哋有一啲嘅手機個app咧，一啲程式咧係可以幫佢哋落單，亦都可以快啲攞。

389
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:44,580
到食物，咁快啲攞到食物就可以自自動可以去多啲地方咯。咁呢個兩個問題啦。第三個問題咧，佢哋就話：，誒，深龍森林船屋其實一路都關閉喎，係咪請唔到人咧？噉樣，因為呢個亦都係影響到成個樂園嘅誒，畀人哋個感覺對佢哋個即係個觀感上面唔好啦。因為有一啲嘅原來一啲設施係長。

390
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:24,730
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, it is difficult in the job market right now. Unemployment's at three percent. The travel industry has really been, you know, impacted negatively with COVID. We are fortunate that we are a preferred employer right now.

391
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:44,740
But it's not to say it's without its difficulties in the market, as as we have discussed, and we've had to put a lot of tactics in place in order to to attract and retain. As relates to our product, you know, thank you for your advice on that. Our our ambitions are to provide opportunities that are

392
01:19:44,740 --> 01:20:04,750
可達得到 for for all incomes, you know, having products that are both, you know, good, better and best options for for all of our guests. And thank you for your advice on the the mobile ordering technology. It's something that the team is working on right now. So thank you for that. As it relates to the treehouse.

393
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:41,880
係唔該啊，主席。誒，咁其實迪士尼喺過去，我瞭解即係疫情嘅期間咧，都誒冇裁減人手嘅。噉我覺得呢個都對一個社會嚟講，都負上咗好即係好大一個一個嘅責任啦。噉我覺得都係好嘅。咁所以都呢個都即係認為都覺得應該要表揚下，即係。

394
01:20:41,880 --> 01:21:01,890
咁困難嘅環境都係大家盡量確保唔好有炒人嘅情況。誒，我咧第二個問題，我想了解下咧，就係誒根據而家睇到嗰個誒復甦嘅情況咁強勁啦。咁當然都仲有誒一條漫長嘅道路要行嘅，因為我見到今日嘅數字咧都係講緊三百四十。

395
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:21,900
十萬嘅嗰個人次，噉我記得咧疫情之前咧，如果講緊疫情之前，一般講緊都係五六百萬到嘅數。我甚至乎記得咧，好多年前喺立法會啲同學都講咧，即係去預期咧，如果去到某一個嘅年份嘅時候咧，應該一路咁增長，係希望去到八百到九百萬嘅人次嘅。咁所以。

396
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:41,910
我相信呢個咧都有賴樂園同政府嗰邊再繼續努力啦嚇，即係希望嗰個人數繼續去誒推翻落去。咁誒請人嗰度咧，我有一個意見嘅。其實我一路都鼓勵樂園方面咧可以考慮下，誒都可以考慮下請喺屯門區嗰度咧係做多啲招聘，因為我哋本區咧好多屯門。

397
01:21:41,910 --> 01:22:01,920
嗰個居民咧，而家我哋知道有條屯赤路咧，根本上去樂園係好方便，咁可能會幫助到你比較容易揾到一啲本地嘅兼職啊，或者半職嘅工作啦，甚至乎而家好多年輕人咧，佢會寧願做半職兼職嘅，咁所以如果你話屯門比較近咧，我覺得你哋可以考慮下。我都知道咧有一架巴士即係叫。

398
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:51,580
嗯。

399
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,190
係嗰人手喺邊？

400
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:54,000
第四項議程。

401
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:30,320
嘅需要咯，噉啊呢方面我哋會繼續同誒迪士尼一齊合作去做好呢方面嘅嘢嚇。好。

402
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:10,260
噉我哋而家邀請政府官員入會議室，有意發言嘅請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。

403
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:49,850
噉我哋今日嘅誒呢個議題就已經完結，咁多謝局方，多謝我哋迪士尼嘅管理層。

404
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:03,140
規管海上醉價同埋藥價，立法會文件係C.B.括弧四四四二斜洞二零二三零五號文件。

405
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:42,950
唔該，噉我補充最後一句啦，就係誒啱啱話啲跨跨文化等等，都希望你各方能夠可以都支持我哋仿製製衣嘅一啲嘅同埋啲時裝嗰邊啦，係。

406
01:24:45,730 --> 01:25:03,670
同一啲本地藝術家，我見到都有，不過就好細規模嘅。咁可以點樣進一步即係有個樂園啦，已經喺度啦，亦都揼咗咁多錢落去啦。點樣利用佢能夠去即係進一步加大促進我哋本地文化產業嗰個發展咧？我兩個問題唔該。好，局長唔該。誒，多謝主席就誒。

407
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:21,930
out三十三嘅咧，可能而家唔係話開得咁密嘅噉，但係我諗都誒，我哋都同政府嗰邊都溝通緊，睇下會唔會可以即係呢啲車咧可以好多都其實基本上係接載啲員工誒翻去去樂園開工嘅噉，睇下會唔可以再有機會加埋一下。但係我係好希望即係樂園嗰方面都能夠考慮下咧，都喺鼓勵。

408
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:25,660
誒，我哋睇到咧，其實喺區域內咧，即係呢啲大型嘅主題公園嘅即係模式咧，都越嚟越多啦。咁即係除咗有上海啦，我哋同時講咗之外，咁其實北京亦都開咗新嘅主題樂園。咁以至咧就係喺誒珠海、喺廣州，其實佢嘅主題樂園亦都做得越嚟越好。噉我想睇下咧。

409
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:45,670
其實誒，國方同埋園方咧，有冇即係就住我哋鄰近嘅一啲競爭對手，即係越嚟越多啦。誒，以致係即係做得越嚟越好咧。其實對我哋嗰個影響係點樣？因為其實除咗頭先所講直接競爭嘅大型樂園之外咧，其實最近喺區域內咧，亦都興起咗好多中小型嘅一啲主題樂園嘅模式。

410
01:23:45,670 --> 01:24:05,680
咁包括深圳亦都已經誒有好幾個開始係即係就嚟有啲，亦都就嚟會開門營業噉樣。咁呢度其實咧都即係即係第一剛才問題咧，就係我哋點樣去評估即係呢啲嘅競爭對我哋嘅影響啦。咁其實呢裏邊咧都有個相關嘅，就其實林建峯議員好即係比較早嘅時候提到咧，即係個遊客來源咧。

411
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:25,690
其實都係即係對我哋去掌握呢個影響，其實十分重要。呢個第一個問題。誒，第二咧就係即係，既然我哋都即係對樂園啦嚇，即係我諗其實頭先好多同事嗰個意見都講咗，就係誒一啲就係即係好睇嘅睇盤漲啦嚇，一啲就係覺得啊，其實佢都有對本地有促重作用嘅。咁但係不無論如何咧，其實。

412
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:45,700
我哋即係政府抌咗咁多錢落去咧，其實誒可唔可以或者可以點樣去加強咧？即係樂園對於我哋本地嘅文化產業或者係一啲藝術產業嘅一啲嘅帶動作用咧。雖然而家係有嘅，但係都同一啲即係比較大型嘅，即係誒，例如金飾啊等等咧呢方面係有啲合作啦，以致咧其實。

413
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:23,960
當然喺誒嗰個我哋去睇喺區裏邊其他競爭嘅時候，誒我哋成日都要考慮，即係其他裏邊大家究竟有誒唔同嘅樂園嘅時候，大家嘅競爭係點啦。咁但係我相信誒迪士尼本身佢有佢一定嘅吸引力喺度，佢亦都有一個即係。

414
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:44,390
迪士尼本身嘅I.P喺度咧，喺其他咧唔係咁易可以去誒完全去同佢作為一個競爭嘅。咁當然誒，你話會唔會有啲人誒？譬如近啲嘅地方去咗嗰個樂園，會減少咗去嚟香港。我唔排除有呢個可能性，但係可能更加多嘅係都會。

415
01:25:44,390 --> 01:26:04,400
去唔同嘅樂園，大家一齊，因為佢譬如去旅行嚟到香港，佢自然都會去，即係都會被吸引咗去迪士尼嗰度去玩啦。咁亦都唔代表佢唔會去長隆啊，或者去其他地方。噉，但我諗有唔同嘅樂園，有唔同嘅地方，再加埋香港其他嘅吸引嘅景點咧，我相信我哋自己本身。

416
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:24,410
係有一定嘅吸引力喺度，咁所以呢方面我哋我哋會做。至於話點樣加強同誒其其他文化界啊嗰啲嘅合作咧，其實我哋過去見到迪士尼都已經誒喺呢方面係開始緊做緊一啲嘅工作。咁當然佢都要整體平衡咧，即係喺誒推動嘅時候，佢亦都會考慮翻佢自己成個運作。

417
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:20,740
有冇？

418
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,930
邊幾個人嚟嗰啲？

419
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,740
我哋今日有。

420
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:36,780
運輸及物流局副秘書長。

421
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:33,850
朱瑞文啊，副秘啊。

422
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:27,300
係啦，我哋而家歡迎當局嘅代表出席會議啦，誒。

423
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:52,390
黃世誒發先生，海事處副處長；温志洋先生，運輸及物流局助理秘書長；黎志東先生，海事處助理處長港口管理嘅。

424
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:16,710
好誒，主席各位委員，大家好。係噉，今日咧，我同海事處嘅同事咧，其實就嚟同各位議員咧，就介紹翻就住立法規管香港水域上面嘅海上醉駕同藥駕嘅最新進展嘅。咁其實咧，誒咁而喺目前嘅情況咧，現時咧，香港咧係冇一個特定嘅法例啦。

425
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:36,720
係規管咧香港水域裡面嘅醉駕同埋藥駕嘅海事處其實係要靠其他嘅海事法例咧，咁咧去去執法嘅。咁而由於我哋冇特定嘅法例規管啦海上嘅醉駕同埋藥駕啦，咁所以咧其實亦都冇一個法例上賦予海事處同埋警方嘅權力，就係萬一係發生咗一啲海

426
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:56,730
上交通嘅事故之後咧，就要求咧涉事嘅人士咧接受強制嘅酒精或者藥物嘅測試嘅。咁因此咧，其實為咗提升翻個海上安全啦，噉我哋就建議咧訂立一條新嘅法例啦，噉樣咧就規管翻海上嘅醉駕同埋藥駕，並且係賦予海事處同警方嘅權力啦，就喺有需。

427
01:28:56,730 --> 01:29:16,740
需要嘅時候咧，就要求咧相關涉案嘅人士咧，就進行呢個強制嘅酒精同埋藥物測試嘅。咁接住落嚟咧，我會請海事處嘅同事咧，用一個投影片嘅形式咧，去介紹翻我哋今次嘅立法建議嘅內容。咁之後咧，我哋係誒好樂意咧接受誒委員嘅提問同埋查詢嘅。咁唔該，咁有請海事處嘅同事。好唔該，係誒。

428
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,180
所進行化驗。

429
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:56,050
咁另外咧，亦都係可以向船隻嘅擁有人啦、代理人啦，或者係船長咧，係誒發出指示。咁甚至乎就係話，如果有壞嘅時候，其實係可以喺船上面進行調查嘅。

430
01:32:51,340 --> 01:33:03,130
咁然後誒，大家可以睇到啦，呢度基本上就係兩個儀器。咁誒，左手邊嗰個就係手提式嘅呼氣儀，誒右手邊嗰個就係一個誒台頭式嘅分析儀器嘅。

431
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:49,910
個程序嘅噉，然後如果係任何人士，如果係冇合理嘅誒解釋而拒絕進行測試嘅話咧，或者係拒絕係提供一個樣本做測試嘅話，其實佢都係犯法嘅。

432
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:27,990
就就係講緊操控嗰條船在航時嘅嘅情況，同埋亦都係包括香港嘅誒領港嘅人士、誒船長啦、誒機房嘅操作員啦，同埋履行一啲特別職責嘅人，譬如話係照顧乘客安全嘅海員都會係跌咗落去嘅。

433
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:35,610
個資格係六個月至到五年不等嘅。咁如果佢從犯又點咧？咁從犯嘅話，如果個法庭或者裁判官認為唔適宜再繼續容許呢個人士係操作船隻或者係喺船上面履行任何嘅職務嘅時候，其實法庭亦都可以取消嗰個人嘅終身嘅資格嘅。

434
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:36,750
誒多謝主席，同埋多謝咁多位議員。噉就住今日嘅規管海上聚價同埋約價嘅立法建議，咁誒，我哋都先頭秘書副秘書長都提咗，就係我哋有一個誒簡介片嘅。咁第一個背景咧，就我諗爭取時間，我都唔會再誒重複嘅啦，因為。

435
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:56,760
先頭副秘書長都介紹咗，其實我哋而家嚟講係並冇一個誒法律嘅賦權係可以做海上呢個藥價同埋測試嘅醉價嘅工作嘅。咁誒就住誒一連串嘅工作咧，其實過往咁多年咧，我哋係一路係做緊嘢嘅。噉就係喺二零一九年咧，其實我哋係邀請咗。

436
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:16,770
喺香港科技大學為咗誒醉駕嘅呼氣檢測儀器咧，係進行一個測試嘅。咁二零二零年咧，其實我哋亦都委聘咗醫學專家咧，為咗誒藥價嗰方面咧個尿液檢測測試工具咧係進行咗測試。噉係誒亦都係制定咗海上現場嘅清醒度嘅測。

437
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:36,780
是嘅。咁去到二零二一年咧，其實我哋亦都係委聘咗臨牀嘅毒理科專家咧，檢視有關海上醉駕同埋藥駕嘅工作流程。咁然後其實誒咁多年嚟，我哋都一直同律政司同埋誒警務處啦緊密合作啦，噉就草擬新嘅法例同埋制定嗰個執法程序嘅。

438
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:57,710
咁喺海上醉駕同埋藥駕罪行嗰方面咧，就誒其實正如投影片所介紹啦。任何參與操作嘅船隻嘅人士喺在航船上或者係要履行一啲嘅職務嘅人士，如果受到酒精同埋藥物嘅影響咧，喺第一就係話嘅。

439
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:17,720
佢就算程度未去到一個誒體內嗰個標準，但係佢都冇能力去妥善操作船隻或者履行指定嘅責任。咁而第二咧就係話佢個體內嘅酒精咧係已經係超過咗定明嘅限度。咁而佢喺藥物嗰方面咧，亦都係喺體內咧含有任何。

440
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:37,730
何嘅指定嘅藥物嘅時候，其實佢係已經係犯咗法㗎啦。咁誒，我哋喺呢度想強調就係話嘅法例嘅誒草擬咧，係只係適用於在航嘅船隻，即係話如果個船係喺趴埋啊、定喺度啊，或者靠喺碼頭嘅時候咧，係誒唔會係跌落去呢一條例嗰個誒執法嗰個。

441
01:31:50,560 --> 01:32:10,570
咁適用範圍咧就誒係包括香港水域內所有誒，如果諗翻之前嗰個投影片咧，就係在航嘅船隻，咁亦都係包括本地嘅船啦、誒內河船啦同埋遠洋船嘅。咁誒至於話嘅誒跌咗入去所謂叫做操作船隻嘅人士咧，就係其實。

442
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:48,780
咁醉駕嘅誒程序咧，就係第一，我哋係有一個誒呼氣嘅測試啦。咁如果係未能夠通過嘅時候咧，咁其實係會再要求佢做一個誒呼氣嘅分析儀嘅一個樣本嘅測試嘅，又或者係提供尿液或者係血液咧，係畀政府化驗。

443
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:52,630
二月，噉我哋都有時間嘅，咁誒五分鐘。

444
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:41,340
住海上醉駕同埋藥駕嘅監管啊，同埋審視埋國際組織嘅規定，咁喺二零一九年。

445
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:47,410
咁誒，而家我哋建議嘅罰則同埋《道路交通條例》第三百七十四章之下誒六上面嘅罪架同埋藥架嘅罪行咧，係罰則都係類同嘅。

446
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:23,510
咁而喺海上醉駕嗰方面咧，咁誒其實亦都係可以做一項或者係多項嘅測試嘅。咁第一咧就係其實我哋有一個海上現場清醒度嘅測試。咁第二咧就係誒一個快速嘅口腔液嘅測試，其實即係簡單啲就係刮一刮嗰條脷，係攞一啲嘅唾液嘅。

447
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:43,520
咁而第三咧就係尿液嘅誒檢查嘅測試。咁而係如果係第一次未能通過嘅話咧，咁其實佢就會做第二個誒程序。咁第二個程序咧就係誒要求嗰個誒誒被我哋執法人員要求去提供樣本嘅人士咧，就要提供尿液或者係血液嘅樣本嘅。

448
01:33:43,520 --> 01:34:03,530
咁當我哋收到呢啲樣本嘅話，其實我哋都會送去政府化驗所嗰邊做化驗。咁大家同樣睇到誒左手邊嗰個咧，就係其實係誒簡單，我哋就係話嘅刮嚟嗰個誒唾液嘅收集，而右手邊嗰個咧就係一個尿杯，我哋簡單啲講叫尿杯啦，就係尿液嘅收集嚟嘅。

449
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:24,330
咁喺執法嗰一方面咧，就係誒我哋建議咧，就係誒海事處嘅二級海事督察啦。誒，如果係警方嗰邊咧，就係警長或者係呢個職級以上嘅人員咧，都應該係有呢個權利嘅。咁第一就係話喺意外發生嘅時候，誒我哋或者係喺交通意外進行抽查嘅時候，要求。

450
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:44,340
後參與操作船隻，誒或者喺船上面履行職務嘅人咧，係進行一個酒精或者係藥物測試。咁第二咧，亦都係授權嘅人員咧，係當佢有合理由嘅誒懷疑某人已經係幹犯罪行嘅情況之下咧，都可以逮捕嗰個人，然後將嗰個人咧係帶離開嗰條船嘅。

451
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:17,290
咁罰則嗰方面咧就誒，基本上就係誒，約價同罪價係一樣嘅，罰款係由五千蚊至到五萬啦。咁或者或者係誒，同埋咧就監禁六個月至到三年嘅。咁當然法庭咧就亦都可以命令取消某一個人喺船上面操作船隻或者係履行職務誒。

452
01:35:48,070 --> 01:36:08,080
咁業界諮詢嗰邊，其實我哋由二零一七年三月咧都就呢個立法嘅框架建議啦，噉就通過我哋亦都諮詢咗我哋本地船隻嘅諮詢委員會啦、港口行動誒事務委員會啦、領港事務委員會啦，同埋高速船嘅諮詢委員會嘅，咁委員都係誒。

453
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:28,090
誒支持嘅，咁海事處其實誒亦都會係誒喺今年嘅五月咧，就重新再諮詢上個上面個我先頭提到嗰四個委員會，咁委員都係誒支持嗰個建議嘅。咁喺個立法時間表呢一方面，我哋就希望可以誒經過今日委員嘅支持。

454
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:48,100
之下，我哋就希望可以今年年底之前將條例草案咧就提交誒立法會審議嘅。咁誒歡迎啊，主席同埋各位議員提問，多謝。好，唔該。咁而家我哋睇到咧就有三位議員誒有提問嘅，我讀一讀先。係陳肇雄議員、周文港議員、譚志明。

455
01:36:52,920 --> 01:37:12,930
誒人多，我到時先再咳啦。咁五分鐘連問連答。誒，陳少雄議員，唔該。好啊，多謝主席。現時本港就冇法例去監管海上醉駕同埋藥駕，噉啊，只能夠以船泊及港口管制條例下喺海上係及他人安全一般罪行一罪人檢控檢控。

456
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:33,060
咁呢個情況咧就係真係誒並不理想，咁因此咧我係贊成當局係立例規管香港水域內海上醉價同埋有價格行為嘅。主席，我有三個問題，第一咧就喺文件第三段度我睇到咧，當局就早喺二零一五年成立咗跨部門工作小組審視香港就

457
01:37:41,620 --> 01:38:01,630
就曾經向立法會進行諮詢。咁當時政府表示咧，計劃喺二零二零至二一年度嘅立法年度以條例草案形式咧就提交議議嘅法例。我我想詢問下局方處方嗰邊條例草案點解到而家都仲未完成個草議，即係提交？

458
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:21,640
交立法會嘅原因係咩咧？噉你涉及到譬如話係道路駕車人士嘅醉駕同埋藥駕嘅，即係有關法令用咗好多年，其實就係因為係海上嘅執法咪涉及到不同部門，所以先就加咗呢啲噉樣嘅，就咁耐時間先搞掂啦。噉我想了解下。第二嘅咧就係我都想了解。

459
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:41,650
一啲過去當局以喺香港水域內危及他人的安全嘅法例進行嘅檢務入邊，有幾多單係涉及海上醉駕同埋藥駕嘅個案咧？噉，主席，我啊嘗試係抄有關嘅資料咧，但暫暫時都未揾到。而喺二零一九年呢一項立法建議當時去立法會。

460
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:41,310
各位議員審議啦，咁到時都好歡迎咧，議員在我哋條例草案裏面咧就提出意見嘅，係啦。

461
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:48,720
好唔該，誒都十二點半啦，咁所以我就喺呢度畫咗線先，誒唔好再加。

462
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:15,540
即係出現咗呢啲噉嘅問題咧，咁咁而且喺喺外國，即係可以據我哋參考嗰啲，噉佢有好多法例法規或者係測試嘅方法。我覺得香港唔應該係即係即係重新開始去做呢樣嘢，應該係有好多可據參考性嘅。

463
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:44,560
啲咧好明顯咧，可能飲醉咗，揸到好似舞龍一樣，噉你冇理由去唔去唔去截停佢去查佢㗎嘛噉樣。咁尤其是特別喺夏天咧，呢啲香港嘅遊艇出沒比較頻繁嘅海域咧，可唔可以增加啲嘅搜查次數？主要係噉啊，唔該主席。係。

464
01:38:41,650 --> 01:39:01,660
諮詢嘅時候，應該有啲誒議員詢問過呢個資料嘅。如果係當局冇呢啲記錄，係點解咧？第三個問題就係誒喺誒海頭先海事處都介紹，就話二零二三年五月啊，誒就住呢個最新嘅立法建議，就曾經諮詢本地船隻諮詢委員會。

465
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:21,670
港口行動事務委員會、領港事務諮詢委員會同埋高速船諮詢委員會。嗱，我注意到文件個寫法咧，佢就第十二段，佢話顯示各個委員會大致支持建議。主席，我想了解下大致支持嘅意思係咩原因咧？就係咩意思咧？

466
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:41,680
就係唔係呢啲委員會仍然有一啲顧慮，或者啲咩保留有關嘅內容係乜嘢？當局係如何處理咧？唔該，主席。係唔該，陳副主席或者好多謝陳議員嘅三個提問啦，或者我先答頭嗰兩個，咁到最後諮詢嗰度咧，我請海事處嘅副處長補充啦。咁首先就係誒嗰個立法時間嘅問題，我哋都明白咧係要。

467
01:39:41,680 --> 01:40:01,690
盡快咧去做呢個立法嘅工作。咁其實咧，我哋政府內部咧就住條例嘅草擬咧，其實都已經完成咗。噉我哋今日諮詢完咧委員會之後，如果委員會同意咧，咁其實我哋應該係會盡快咧將條條例加上立法會嘅。咁其實咧誒，因為咧其實係一個全新嘅條例啦。咁所以其實喺一九年咧，我哋嚟個諮詢委員會，委員同意我哋嘅方向之後咧。

468
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:21,700
其實我哋好似頭先啊副處長嘅投影片都講啦，咁其實我哋已經咧就會誒出新嘅條例，我哋會同律政司啦、警方啦就住個執法嘅安排會進行一個溝通啦，去釐清咗嗰個誒安排嘅情況啦。咁另外其實咧，因為咧海上面測試誒醉駕同藥駕嘅儀器咧，咁雖然我哋係用翻陸路嗰度，咁但因為海上咧其實係。

469
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:41,710
漂下漂下㗎嘛，咁所以其實咧，我哋都要委託翻相關嘅專家咧，確保嗰個進行測試，確保個儀器咧喺海上面嘅時候咧個準確度都係一樣嘅。咁呢個係第一個誒部分嘅答案啦。第二個就係嗰啲誒海上醉價同藥價嘅數字係啦。咁其實咧就真係咧，因為而家其實我哋係冇一個法例咧去規管醉價同藥價嘅，咁所以。

470
01:40:41,710 --> 01:41:01,720
咧，的確，我哋係冇一個執法上嘅數字嘅。咁其實海事處咧就有關危及卡人安全嘅海上執法嘅數字。咁但係由於其實當中咧亦都冇一個細分，就話咩係醉駕同藥駕。咁所以其實我哋嚟家目前咧，的確咧冇呢一個數字嘅。噉就住本地諮詢嗰度咧，噉我請我請個副處長補充啊。係誒，多謝阿陳議員，亦都。

471
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:21,730
誒主席，咁誒就住嗰個諮詢嗰度咧，其實就唔係委員裡面誒委員會嗰四個諮詢委員會裡面有委員反對，而係佢哋係想澄清一啲嘅細節。誒，我舉個例子，有一個就係話嘅，因為我哋而家係跟道路誒交通條例嗰個誒標準嘅，我講嘅係醉駕。

472
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:41,740
噉就係喺一百毫升嘅呼氣裏面咧，就唔唔應該係超過有廿二個微克嘅誒嗰個酒精嘅。咁但係喺國際海事誒標準嗰度咧，即係國際海事組織嘅標準咧，係二十五個微克嘅。噉啊變咗，其實當時係誒有委員就係問話嘅啊，咁遠洋船嚟到香港。

473
01:41:41,740 --> 01:42:01,750
噉佢應該係跟邊個標準啊？點解係你哋同國際海事標準係唔一致㗎？咁其實呢個就唔係一個問題嚟嘅，因為根據國際海事組織嗰個標準咧，其實自己嘅其他國家都係嘅，你嘅港口係可以定立自己嘅要求，你係可以畀佢再嚴謹嘅。咁所以其實就唔。

474
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:21,760
係話嘅誒，嗰四個諮詢委員會係有委員反對，而係佢哋想澄清一啲嘅細節嘅啫。咁誒，多謝主席。啊，主席，我想好快跟進我第一個問題就其實誒四年嘅時間去去到今天都仲係即係草擬，徵詢我哋意見咧。其實就誒喺個過程之中係咪即係遇到啲咩困難？

475
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:41,770
譬如頭先所講，純粹係個測試個工具同埋測試嘅方法啦，定係話即係喺有好多即係誒成個過程之中推進，係有啲誒即係想象唔到嘅困難，譬如包括埋係咪唔想即係誒未成熟，立法會立法會又會有好多即係疑問啊噉。其實我我想誒誒一個好重要嘅信息就係話誒。

476
01:42:41,770 --> 01:43:01,780
進化要立法呢個大家都有共識嚟嘅，就只不過你個立法入邊嘅細節盡早即係出台之後，等我哋可以幫你一齊去審視咧相關嘅法例點樣寫得好。咁因為一般誒即係市民大眾嘅諗法就係話，其實你而家道路嘅誒有關嘅醉駕、藥駕嗰啲，其實行咗好多年㗎啦。咁點解就應用喺海上會？

477
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:38,430
係。

478
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:18,820
整道測試嗱，陸上好簡單咧，佢喺度行條直線咧，睇下你有冇左搖右擺啦噉。但係海上點做嘅咧？佢喺度搖下搖下喺個海嗰度。

479
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:33,850
安全嘅嘅嘅罪行嘅，咁呢個就會變咗係誒會個別去處理咯。係多謝啊，主席。好，唔該。誒，下一位譚志明議員。

480
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:50,250
開麥，呢個所謂誒海上嘅最高或者藥價咧，你哋嗰個檢測嘅標準係咪同陸上嗰個嘅標準一樣咧？即係個酒精含量度啊噉樣。

481
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:36,140
好，李書長哦，好多謝誒陳議員嘅噉。其實好似頭先咁講咧，其實我哋咧誒內部條例嘅草擬嘅工作咧，其實都誒已經係完成嘅啦。噉我哋其實所有嘢咧，其實都誒無論係誒測試啦誒各方面啦，其實我哋都已經誒處理咗嘅。咁之後咧，今次委員會同意咧，咁其實我哋下一步就會將條法案咧提交立法會，就畀大誒。

482
01:43:49,000 --> 01:44:09,010
個議員嘅提問啦。咁下一位係周文港議員，唔該。多謝主席。其實咧，我係支持當局就住呢個規管海上醉價藥價係立法嘅。咁但係我睇到咧，佢就誒個個現已法例咧，只係適用於在航嘅船隻，唔包括呢個冒泊係岸同埋國淺嘅船隻。咁但係咧，一般咧嗰啲。

483
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:29,020
譬如話遊艇啦噉樣嚇，噉佢如果發生意外撞埋咗去噉樣，咁停低㗎啦。其實，咁呢度會唔會因為你唔包括頭先所講嘅三個情況，而冇辦法去查佢咧？呢個係第一個問題。第二樣嘢咧，就會唔會未來喺嗰個誒抽查一啲嘅海上船隻嗰方面咧，因為有。

484
01:44:44,850 --> 01:45:04,860
局方係誒多謝主席。咁誒其實回應翻阿議員先頭嗰個問題。咁第一啦，或者我倒轉由尾嗰度答起先啦。咁誒其實喺我哋嘅巡查嚟講咧，我哋除咗佢話嘅係幹犯咗一啲嘅海上交通條例啦，或者係佢直情係違反咗一啲嘅避碰條例啦。咁其實我哋

485
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:24,870
我哋都會係抽樣誒調查嘅。咁如果譬如話喺我哋嘅巡查嗰陣時候，我哋見到有船，即係等於一個人飲醉咗走行路，佢係之字型嘅都行唔到直線嘅。咁其實我哋係會誒去截佢嘅，我哋都會上船調查嘅。咁另外喺個調查嗰方面，其實唔係淨係誒我哋海事處嘅，因為好多時我哋都

486
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:44,880
都會同埋警方咧都會做一啲嘅聯合嘅行動。咁其實誒，警方嗰邊佢自己都有佢自己嘅誒巡查嘅，所以喺呢一方面咧，就對於一啲誒喐緊嘅船，其實誒我哋係係會做到我哋應該係要做嘅工作。咁至於你話嘅誒，如果今日有一條船停泊咗喺度誒，其實咧船上面啲。

487
01:45:44,880 --> 01:46:04,890
啲人咧都飲到誒，即係講句冇聽醉呼呼，或者係係已經係服咗藥。咁然後有另外一條船行緊撞咗埋去嘅話，咁嗱，首先喺呢一條條例嚟講，我哋嘅草擬咧就係話，船上面嘅人如果佢係飲醉咗，係我哋係誒唔會唔會對佢做任何嘅嘢。

488
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:24,900
嘅，因為我哋都講咗係佢唔係在行，但係嗰個嚟講，我哋喺海事處嘅執法，甚至乎嚴重、再嚴重嘅話，其實誒警方都會介入嘅。咁嗰個我哋係屬於一個交通事故嘅調查。咁調查之後，其實又會翻返去先頭誒提到嗰樣嘢，佢可能都會干犯到一啲危及他人。

489
01:46:50,530 --> 01:47:10,540
第二樣咧，頭先你都解釋咗話海上執法嘅，海上執法好難㗎嘛。陸上執法睇佢揸車有冇擺嚟擺去就好易睇啊，喺條馬路嗰度。但係海上離遠睇，除非你喺尾跟住佢嘅啫。如果唔係嘅話，你點樣睇到佢擺嚟擺去咧？噉啊，有相當嘅難度啊嚇。咁咧就誒，當然你頭先都講咗啦，除咗海事處，當係水警誒。

490
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:30,550
都會幫手去去執法啦。咁但係你頭先提到咧巡查，我想問下咧咩叫巡查嗱？頭先你講咗啦，如果有意外發生，噉你就去去誒上船去檢查，噉就梗係check下佢哋有冇飲酒啦，噉樣諸如此類。咁但係其實誒呢個都唔係我哋最關注，反為就喺啲誒熱天啊，譬如西貢啊嗰～

491
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:40,310
咪case出現啊嘛！

492
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,350
係，多謝啊，主席。好，仲有冇補充？

493
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,140
唔反對啦，即係支持支持，好唔該。

494
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:06,180
如果冇其他事項咧，噉就宣佈今日會議結束。多謝各位，多謝大家。

495
01:51:56,420 --> 01:52:01,470
好，噉我哋呢一個議題都完結啦。咁最後其他事項。

496
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:28,920
其實我哋都會係誒制止佢嘅。咁當然咧，當我哋制止佢，如果站喺而家我哋建議嘅呢條例嘅情況之下，其實我哋係有權要求佢誒做一個藥價或者係誒醉駕嘅測試嘅。

497
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:55,110
其實玩快艇或者係誒先頭啊議員提嗰樣嘢，即係話比較一啲高速嘅動作。咁當然啦，第一樣嘢我哋其實都會睇，就係話佢其實係未已經所謂叫做超速。

498
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:50,890
啊冇啦，主席啊，我支持呢個呢個修例嘅嚇。好噉，多謝所有嘅委員今日嘅提問啦。咁誒亦都多謝政府各方面。咁請問誒請諮問我哋委員誒詢問委員係咪誒有否不反對政府當局將上述嘅立法建議提交立法會？

499
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:50,560
啲好多啲遊艇喺度出入嘅地方啊，咁啲人啊飲咗啲西少酒啦，未必飲醉㗎，噉啊落去揸快艇啊，拉下人去劃水啊，咁嗰個先係最安最危險嘅地方啊！咁嗰啲你哋巡查咪即係你哋會來唔少去嗰度即係檢抽查咧？噉啊，即係噉啊，就另外咧就係誒，當然頭先我提到啦，呢個範圍。

500
01:47:50,560 --> 01:48:10,570
咧喺呢啲嘅誒遊艇出沒嘅地方，好多人聚集喺度玩快艇咧，先至係往往咧市民受傷嘅地方嚟嘅。呢啲有咩方法可以去防止或者係減少咧？咁咁頭先你都提到咧，海上清醒度測試，我唔係好理解點樣可以做海上清醒。

501
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:39,110
好，我諗海事處。好啊，好啊，係，多謝主席，多謝阿譯議員嘅提問。咁第一咧就係誒，我哋同陸上嗰個誒罰則或者嗰個標準咧係誒一樣嘅，即係我哋同陸上嗰個標準係約價同埋誒醉價都係一樣嘅。咁第二咧就係講緊搖擺嗰樣。

502
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:59,120
嘢咁誒，其實有我哋通常如果啲船係亂咁揸，或者佢係違反咗嗰個交通條例嗰個誒，因為海上有海上自己交通條例嘅。簡單啲講，我哋叫避碰條例。佢係如果係唔跟住個避碰條例揸，其實我哋係睇到，我哋會知道。咁當然亦都回應翻阿阿譯議員嗰個誒講法。

503
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:19,130
就係話，其實我哋唔係要等到有事故發生，然後我哋或者睇到有啲船嗰個運作係有啲怪，我哋至去截佢嘅。其實我哋都會做抽樣調查嘅。咁另外再講就係話，除咗我哋自己海事處嘅船隊啦，咁其實誒警方嘅船隊都係會幫我哋一齊去執法嘅。咁至於誒。

504
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:39,140
清醒度嗰度咧，就誒或者我會交我助理處長嗰度啦。因為其實岸上誒海上面咧，阿議員係講得啱嘅。誒海上面有陣時候會係風平浪靜，但係有陣時候亦都會係有我哋叫有湧啦、有浪啦，船係未必係可以好穩定噉樣停喺度。咁呢一度或者我想交誒我。

505
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:59,150
我助理處長阿黎生答一答馬奕議議員呢個提問啦。啊，好啊，誒誒，多謝阿議議員嘅提問。至於個海上清醒度測試咧，其實就根據陸上而家用緊嗰個誒，譬如行直線啦、單腳跳啊，佢modify出嚟嘅，咁亦都係參考咗即係陸上呢個誒測試啦，亦都參考咗外國一啲執。

506
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:19,160
百機構嘅測試，而到揾呢個醫學專家咧，嚟到寫出嚟嘅程式嘅，其實佢都係誒經過問一啲問題啦，睇下佢清唔清醒啦，識唔識得答啦，同埋一啲誒身體嘅協調啦，譬如誒手掌拍啊，或者拳頭交互去誒誒誒一個答一個噉樣，咁誒令到我哋係誒去。

507
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:39,170
去平平衡究竟呢個誒人士係咪會受到酒精嘅影響咯？咁呢個都係一個初步嘅測試嚟嘅。明白。誒，可唔可以講一講點樣防止嗰啲啊，即係熱天啊玩快艇所產生嗰啲嘅意外滑水啊嗰啲咧，會車親人啊咁？有咩方法啊？因為呢年都都有呢啲。

508
01:50:55,390 --> 01:51:15,400
或者佢係一啲嘅所謂叫做誒速度限制區裏面咧，佢係誒唔合適去處理或者係進行呢一類嘅活動。咁第三就係話嘅，如果當佢嘅動作係牽涉到危害，唔係淨係講緊佢自己，而係附近嘅交通嘅海面其他使用者都會製造咗一個危險嘅時候，其實。
