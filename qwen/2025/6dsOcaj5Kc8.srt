1
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,420
喺。

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,900
誒喺。

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,410
誒！我哋而家夠鐘又夠人。

4
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,600
我想請問委員有冇意見？

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,080
第二項咧，就係下次會議嘅討論事項。

6
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,730
委員建議嘅項目咧，經整合後已經係納入咗喺待議事項一覽表入邊㗎啦。

7
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,480
如果委員冇意見嘅話，下次會議就安排討論上述嘅議題。

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930
同事，大家早上好，歡迎大家出席交通事務委員會會議。

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:50,100
文件上咧就大家應該都見到有兩份嘅一個待議事項一覽表同埋跟進行動一覽表。

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,600
噉啊，下次嘅例會咧，就係將喺三月二十一號星期五上晝十點四十五分至到下晝十二點四十五分進行。

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:34,760
誒秘書處就喺誒網上同埋畀各位委員咧發出咗五份文件，噉樣再列咗喺會議程上，我想請委員察悉。

12
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:23,400
今次嘅議程咧有幾項嘅，我哋進入第一項咧就係自二零二四年十二月十六日會議後咧發出嘅資料文件。

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:10,850
如果大家冇其他問題咧，我哋進入個議程嘅第三項就係香港電車有限公司嘅加價申請。我想請工作人員邀請政府當局嘅代表同埋電車公司嘅代表進入會議室。

14
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:24,790
政府當局就建議討論以下兩項議題嘅，第一個就係公共小巴業界嘅經營環境，以及第二項係公共道路設施優化及景觀美化工作。

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:02,920
噉係誒分別係立法會C.B.庫三二零零斜洞二零二五庫零號一號嘅文件，另外一份就係立法會C.B.庫三二零零斜洞二零二五庫零二號文件。

16
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:51,230
我就想誒請各位委員察識啦。誒，我同埋副主席就喺上個月誒，喺今個月二月十一號同埋局方商討，同埋跟進委員喺上次一月十四號會議上建議嘅討論項目。

17
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,360
嗯。

18
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,020
嘅收入咧，亦都係繼續會有波動嘅。

19
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,190
大王，博先生，Mr. Paul Tavaldi， welcome to the meeting.

20
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,140
未來營運成本、收入、利潤同埋回報嘅預測，同埋公眾嘅接受程度等等嘅。

21
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:59,340
同埋誒電車有限公司財務及採購總監陳學生先生，啊，歡迎大家出席呢個會議。

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,780
相關嘅文件咧，當局提供咗喺立法會CB庫三二零零斜洞二零二五庫三庫零三號文件嘅。

23
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:53,050
已經係在於政府發出嘅文件咧，電車公司嘅代表咧稍後亦都會就佢嘅加價建議、營運同埋財政狀況咧，同埋服務提升嘅計劃咧，向各委員咧係作出簡介嘅。

24
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:28,860
持喺相對高嘅水平，政府亦都鼓勵電車公司咧喺傳承電車歷史價值嘅同時咧，推行一係列改善項目同埋引進創新嘅措施咧，持續提升電車服務嘅吸引力，為乘客提供更加安全同埋舒適嘅旅程。

25
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:07,990
另一方面咧，電車公司嘅總營運成本就持續上升。由於電車公司嘅成本咧結構咧係相對缺乏彈性，員工嘅成本佔總營運成本咧大約三分之二，令到咧可以節省成本嘅空間咧係相對有限嘅。

26
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:25,560
鑑於營運成本持續上漲同埋未來幾年收入嘅不確定性咧，電車公司係提出加價建議，以期喺長遠而言咧維持公司嘅財務穩健，亦都可以係繼續有能力以合理嘅票價提供優質高效嘅電車服務。

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:45,550
噉啊！出席嘅代表咧，分別就有運流局啊葉海英副秘書長，誒同埋運流局二至運輸處嘅其他政府代表，我哋唔一一講啦。咁另外咧，我都歡迎香港電車有限公司嘅代表，分別就係董事總經理。

28
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:21,620
好啦，噉就誒稍後落嚟咧。我知道誒運輸及物流局副秘書長葉海英先生咧，佢會準備咗一個簡介嘅文件嘅，噉就會喺電腦嘅投影片做一個介紹。噉啊，如果大家委員係有意提問嘅，

29
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:41,630
咧請誒按鈕誒提問噉啊！我暫時定嘅時間咧就係四分鐘連問連答。噉啊，首先請啊葉秘書長誒同我哋做一個簡介。係，多謝主席。啊，主席各位委員，大家早晨。今日咧，我哋就電車公司加價申請咧，係諮詢委員會嘅意見嘅。噉啊，長情咧。

30
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:13,340
電車咧喺自一九零四年以嚟咧行走於港島北岸，提供零排放同埋價格相宜嘅公共交通服務，發揮重要嘅輔助功能。電車咧非常有香港特色，亦都係具有特別嘅歷史意義，一直咧係廣受市民同埋遊客歡迎嘅。一直以嚟咧，電車公司嘅服務質素咧為

31
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,010
But Hong Kong Tramways is much more than a company running a commercial activity.

32
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,840
這positive contribution to the community is deeply rooted in Trump's DNA.

33
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,360
International benchmarks, and we have a very positive satisfaction score and love from the public.

34
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,120
這positive contribution to the Hong Kong economy is not measured, but it is real and it is significant.

35
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:54,310
它contributes to sustaining the core activity and to expanding the outreach of the company, generating a positive dynamic.

36
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:05,590
having sustained for 120 years now, Ding Ding is very resilient. However, we also face significant challenges. Three of them being prominent.

37
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:03,880
This is not an easy decision, and I know that some of you have expressed concerns. I hope that this presentation and our discussion will help to describe our ambition and to address your concerns.

38
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Dear Chairman, Honourable Legislative Council Members, Dear Government Representatives, I'm Paul Chavodé, Managing Director of Hong Kong Tramways. I'm here with Sam Chan, Head of Finance for Hong Kong Tramways.

39
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:34,490
Besides offering unforgettable memories to Hong Kong residents and visitors, as well as pleasant and relaxing journeys, Hong Kong tramway also aims at generating a positive contribution to the community.

40
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm going to share some information with you regarding our application for a fare increase, and the reason why we think it is the right decision for Hong Kong Tramways, for its employees, its passengers and its ecosystem.

41
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:46,080
similarly, you are well aware that our business model has evolved over the years. As we obviously cannot extend the tram line, we have developed new activities and business lines besides transportations using the tram brand as a platform.

42
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:48,720
Over the years, we have partners with many NGOs and local stakeholders, either offering tram tours for people in need or certain categories of population, or by letting them use our trams to increase their outreach, raise funds or organise events.

43
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:10,780
tramways also generates positive economic externalities for the community and Hong Kong economy, both as a convenient public transport, reducing congestion in the island city centre, and by helping to attract more visitors and tourists in Hong Kong.

44
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:29,190
就住公司嘅營運狀況同加價申請同座位咧，係作出介紹嘅。噉我哋樂意喺聽到委員嘅意見之後咧，係再作交流。多謝主席。好，Mr. Paul Tavaldi， we like to start your introduction and the briefing on the subject matter， please。

45
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:11,400
今日咧，我哋會認真聆聽各位委員對電車公司加價嘅申請嘅意見。咁稍後咧，我哋會係諮詢交通諮詢委員會，然之後咧再向行政會議咧係作出個建議嘅。咁而家咧，我先想請咧電車公司誒董事總經理Mister Paul Tuvadi。

46
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:49,440
與此同時咧，基於香港島居住人口減少啦，同埋面對其他公共交通工具嘅激烈競爭，電車嘅乘客量咧出現下跌嘅趨勢。預計喺未來幾年咧，電車乘客量同埋每年車費收入嘅增長咧會放緩，而電車公司嘅廣告收入同埋其他非車費。

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:46,050
正如文件提到咧，喺評估電車公司加價申請嘅時候咧，政府一如以往會做好把關工作。我哋會全盤考慮各項嘅因素，當中包括電車服務同埋改善項目嘅質同埋量啦。電車公司自上次調整票價以嚟嘅營運成本同埋收入嘅變動。

48
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:25,800
所以你 all 知道香港 tramway 是 very well，所以我會 be very fast on this part of the presentation。但係， it is very important to note that besides being a part of the heritage of Hong Kong and a very famous landmark， it is still a very popular transportation means with around 140 000 passengers per day， which is extremely significant for a tram line， according to。

49
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,350
and I would like to emphasise that our employees fully deserve their their salaries.

50
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,230
但第一，和最，重要，作為情況變得危機，在二零二二年。

51
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,520
Our second challenge is the patronage, which has been structurally decreasing over the years.

52
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:09,000
This is the main reason why our operating expenses have increased over the recent period, as summarised in the in the paper.

53
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,310
It was necessary, and we reinvested much more than the revenues generated by the previous fare increase in these salary increases.

54
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,510
Our staff drive, repair and build the trams in-house, and we have more than 500 loyal, dedicated and skilful employees.

55
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:27,940
Our activity is based on people. We have a very high level of internalisation, and the salaries represent 70% of our overall costs, including investment.

56
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:54,670
我們不期望 ridership 到達 pre-COVID 水平，因應新模式、結構性改變、人口結構和經濟活動在香港島。

57
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:45,480
We have been working a lot on retaining and recruiting our staff, and I can develop our actions later if you wish. In particular, retention of the staff and reduction of the turnover really matters to us.

58
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:18,000
The first challenge that we face is about the workforce, as you are fully aware of. The public transport is a very labour-intensive industry, and it is even more the case with tramways.

59
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:35,260
We have been working very hard over the past few years about this issue, as it represents a vital challenge for Hong Kong tramways. If we cannot handle this challenge properly, the very existence of Dingding could be at stake.

60
00:10:50,510 --> 00:11:02,380
We decided to trigger significant salary increases for the front-line staff, as the salaries we offered at that time were below the market level and below the salaries offered by other companies for similar positions.

61
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:06,320
The situation is even more critical for technicians who are very strategics as the trams are made in house. The age pyramid is unfavourable, with a significant share of our technicians aged over 65.

62
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:22,060
Besides, we have a lot of different expertise. We have mechanical fitters, electrical fitters, plumbers, welders, carpenters. They are all the skills are very different, and it takes a significant amount of time and experience to really master a technical position in Hong Kong Tramways Company.

63
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:52,690
However, we have been facing a long-term decreasing trend of our headcount, and at the same time, our workforce is ageing. At the moment, two-thirds of our staff is aged 50 years old or more, and a significant share of them is aged above 60 years old.

64
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:37,740
However, if we are much closer to the market, to the labour market right now, following the market trends will also be challenging, as average annual salary increase rate in transportation sector is structurally well above the inflation, according to the official statistics.

65
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,410
但。

66
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,680
For a transportation company, safety is key.

67
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,210
Our second direction is to keep developing new activities and additional revenues.

68
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:36,020
In particular, we develop new tourism products, free ride days, and a lot of different revenue streams.

69
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,600
或由 upgrading the infrastructure and the trams to improve the quality of our transportation service.

70
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:16,700
Although our safety statistics have improved since 2021, according to official statistics, we want to do better. We have to do better.

71
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:45,140
Our passengers also expect a better passenger experience, which is the reason why we will release this year a tram app to communicate the next tram information to our passengers.

72
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:04,070
We have three main directions. Our first main direction is about our core business. We are a transportation company, and this is our primary mission on Hong Kong Island.

73
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:15,950
It makes us very different from other transportation companies, which order vehicles and rolling stock from industrial suppliers. We manufacture our own vehicles and rolling stocks.

74
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:29,830
As for the other challenges, we listed some actions undertaken in the recent period to modernise our system and keep it up and running, with a significant increase in investment both on the tram and the tram infrastructure.

75
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:09,180
similarly to the third challenge, we didn't remain idle. We acted in two main directions. The first one being to improve the passenger service and experience, for example by installing a new electronic payment system.

76
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:29,470
Our second direction has been to increase commercial revenues, as you encouraged us to do in the past. It worked successfully with almost 10 percentage points increase in commercial revenues from 2020 2014 to 2024.

77
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:49,420
However, this stream of revenues is by nature less stable and more volatile, and we already harvested the low-hanging fruits, meaning that finding new profitable IDs is more and more difficult year after year.

78
00:12:51,980 --> 00:13:05,290
Our third challenge is to maintain and modernise our unique system, which is designed and built in-house. It requires a significant level of expertise, effort and investment to do so and keep operating trams after decades.

79
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:35,280
And for example, we will install cameras on the tram for safety purpose. For example, to have better investigation after after accidents or better training of our tram drivers. And we will use our new smart ding ding system, which has been completed last month, to monitor better monitor the speed of the drivers.

80
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:51,840
So, in a nutshell, over the recent period, we have significantly invested in our staff and in our assets. It delivered results. We are stabilising the situation in terms of headcount, and we are gradually consolidating our technical foundations. However, this has to be confirmed, and this has to be amplified in the coming future.

81
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,450
I can mention three examples.

82
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,880
這些projects require resources on top of the necessary salary increase trend.

83
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,630
第二方向，consistent with our DNA and with the Hong Kong government policy， is to accelerate on tourism.

84
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:22,040
eventually, we started a digital transformation plan to improve our internal efficiency, quality and productivity.

85
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:14,540
similarly, we must replace important tram components which are invisible to the passengers, but which 30 to 40 years of existence.

86
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:24,910
在terms of financial parameters，as mentioned in the document from TLB， tramways has been slightly profitable in 2024 with around 3% margin。

87
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:34,340
However, we are planning for the future with a 100 million investment plan until 2029, on top of the dynamic trend in terms of salary increases that I mentioned.

88
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:47,860
Our third direction is to keep modernising our system. Most of these actions are invisible from the public, but in the coming years we will have to renew key components of our system.

89
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:04,140
The first example is that we are installing at the moment digital screens with our advertising licence on some tram shelters to further increase the advertising revenues from the tram shelters.

90
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:51,690
第一項是，去年，因為折扣票價和促銷活動，近45%的乘客付了比全價少於3美元的票價，這是很顯著的。

91
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:15,230
第三點，這增加，經過三年的穩定，是相似於百分比到運輸工資指數過去兩年的增加。它因此反映我們的成本。

92
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:36,370
Third third point, leveraging on the success of this activity, we are going to design and build a new party tram with the aim to also use this new party tram for tourism-related activities.

93
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:40,430
This is the reason why we propose today this fare increase of 30 cents per ride, which can seem quite important in percentage but remains moderate in absolute value. I would like to mention three points.

94
00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:03,860
Second, with this increase, tramsways would still remain the most affordable means of transportation on Hong Kong Island, maintaining a 31% gap with the cheapest parallel bus route. This is the gap that we closely monitor.

95
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:24,340
We are revamping our sightseeing tram, named the tramoramic, and we are currently developing new tools. I can explain more later, but it is a strategic pillar for us, and we work more and more closely with the Hong Kong Tourism Board on this angle.

96
00:15:48,230 --> 00:16:06,880
sorry to be a bit technical, but regarding the tram track, we are going to renew many points and crossings, which are strategic equipment on the tram line. In terms of safety, most of those have been installed for more than 25 years old, and are now reaching their life end. We have to replace them in particular for safety reasons and prevent any derailment.

97
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,540
噉啊！

98
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,500
分別讀出個名咧，就。

99
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,380
多謝。多謝，Mr Tavaldi。

100
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,470
主席，噉啊真係好少，我撳到第一個嘅嚇。

101
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,570
Investments which could jeopardise the future of Hong Kong tramways.

102
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,220
Furthermore, we do not apply for a fair increase every year, and this increase has to be considered in a plenary annual perspective.

103
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:24,190
育兒假，譬如誒呢個婚誒產假嘅優化，噉我想聽下有啲咩最新嘅進展啦。

104
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:47,890
It is therefore especially important for us, in addition to the commercial revenues that we strive to develop, to ensure significant revenue from our core transportation business to finance this investment in our staff and in our assets.

105
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:53,910
多謝電車公司嘅代表誒，戴先生。以下落嚟嘅時間就係我哋委員誒發表意見同埋提問嘅時間。我見到示意表達想發言嘅咧有七位，暫時。

106
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:11,590
So to conclude very shortly, I would like to emphasise that Hong Kong tramways is at the same time very resilient, as it has been proven over 120 years of existence, but at the same time it is also still fragile, with several critical risks which, if not addressed properly, could threaten its long-term viability.

107
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:15,750
第一位陸仲雄議員、李振強議員、陳學鋒議員、嚴光議員、郭偉強議員、張欣宇議員同埋姚柏良副主席嘅，噉啊，我定個時間就係誒連問連答四分鐘先。噉啊，第一位請陸仲雄議員。

108
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:54,980
噉啊！再加上電車又好叻嘅，即係識得揾信用卡公司做合作。噉啊，你用信用卡do嘅話咧，仲減一蚊添。咁所以我個人咧都成日搭電車㗎嚇，即係我主要就為立法會咧搭電車去灣仔，去好多工會咧，我哋會址嗰度開會嘅。

109
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:37,810
噉啊誒電車嘅加價咧，其實誒個加幅咧，其實都相對温和嘅，即係起碼喺個實際金額上邊，我相信都唔會為即係市民帶來太大嘅壓力嚇。就算誒成人都係加三毫子啫，係咪？香港地三毫子都唔係咩錢啦。

110
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:31,910
所以我們的ambition at the moment is to keep consolidating Hong Kong tramways in the long term, for it to contribute even more to the attractiveness of Hong Kong and to the quality of life of its residents. Most of the projects we present have a long term impact and will benefit Hong Kong, and we want to avoid a scenario of attrition and we want to avoid to reduce.

111
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,480
In terms of employee.

112
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,590
工具即係即係，其實我覺得係對電車公司好唔公平，所以我我哋一直都建議咧，譬如。

113
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,830
政府應該畀個特別嘅scheme畀電車嚇，你直頭津貼老人家免費搭電車。

114
00:23:53,510 --> 00:24:00,680
供畀係誒電車公司嘅嚇，噉就住第二部分，可能請電車公司嘅代表解答下嚇。好啊，請啊大生。

115
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:53,760
also the maternity leave from 40 weeks, 14 weeks 80% pay to 18 weeks full pay, and I have other examples, similar examples, so we pay a significant attention to the well-being of our employees.

116
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:21,240
Sorry, the employees are the main asset of the Trump company, and we pay significant attention to the well-being of our staff. And apart from the salaries, we increased the benefits over the past few years. For example, in 2024, we introduced one day of childcare leave for our staff.

117
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:54,030
啊！啊，主席，我覺得應該真係同政府反映一下，即係唔單止係幫電車公司，我相信咧對我哋嗰個政府財政咧誒都有啲幫助嘅。噉我係呢幾點意見啫，唔該，主席。好啊，啊六二啊，仲有誒，仲有一啲唔好意思，仲有一啲工會特別叫我睇睇佢問嘅。

118
00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:12,980
就係咧，誒誒，可唔可以咧延長咧我哋啲車長嘅退休年齡，由六十延長到六十五歲？因為而家其實六十至六十五歲，第一就冇乜長者福利嘅，除咗搭車之外，第二咧呢班車長咧都係有經驗亦都有能力嘅，係唔可以延長個退休時間？唔該。

119
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:15,420
噉我都用家噉樣咁咧嗱，不過我想問幾個問題嘅。第一個咧就係誒，都係工會嘅關注嘅角度，想了解下咧誒電車公司咧呢幾年咧誒對於誒回應我哋工會一啲嘅訴求，包括係加人工啦啊、追落後啦一啲嘅家庭友善政策啦誒，譬如。

120
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:44,490
咁咧就另外一方面咧，就係誒，我都即係覺得要同政府提下咧。其實電車咧係真正唯一沒有接受政府資助嘅，即係誒主流嘅大型嘅公共交通公司嘅企業嚇。噉我覺得其實對於即係電車嘅競爭。

121
00:20:44,490 --> 00:21:04,500
市場競爭嚟講咧，唔好公平嘅。咁所以呢個你話政策上咧，我哋其實都一直都建議咧兩蚊搭車，或者叫做唔係叫兩蚊搭車，因為即係電車老友記啊，只係個半嘅啫，都唔使兩蚊。咁所以政府一直都呢個理由咧就冇資助畀電車嘅。即係我覺得咧，其實就係懲罰咗一個咧比較廉價嘅交通。

122
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:36,120
你津貼佢個半搭電車咧，佢可能咧慳翻咧搭巴士、搭地鐵嗰個兩蚊乘車優惠嗰個政府嘅補貼嘅喎。你諗下，你搭巴士或者搭港鐵，你政府一程補貼老人家可能要幾蚊，噉你而家補貼著老友記搭電車都個半啫嘛，喺財赤之下。

123
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,880
係嘛？

124
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,660
咪就係。

125
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,950
to generate new revenues.

126
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:31,630
提議加價加得夠唔夠，係咪過於剋制？係考慮點樣樣？第二咧就係關於啲飛票無收入，包括埋係咪善用咗你個車廂做一係列嘅特色嘅誒產品噉樣樣咧？噉啊，即係請誒電車公司代表啊，大生。

127
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:33,270
好啊！誒，六議員問嘅基本兩組問題，第一組關於工人嘅福祉，誒包括頭先誒都提到就話延長嗰個誒工作嘅年期啦。咁第二咧就係我諗係政府都可以回應下嘅，因為問到誒究竟政府喺電車公司嘅營運入邊會唔會考慮？

128
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:53,280
提供某一種嘅資助或者係津貼啊等等，我哋咁噉啊，不如我想請副秘書長先答咗第二條問問題先啦。第一條問題稍後想請電車公司嘅代表講一講你對工人嗰方面嗰個福利啊同埋個薪酬等等、工作時數安排等等嗰啲一拼去回應啦噉。咁先請阿副秘書長先。

129
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:13,490
好誒，唔該，主席誒，多謝議員嘅意見啦。咁誒，就住電車嗰度咧，其實如果交通費咧，咁現時當然我哋六十歲以上，我哋兩元乘車優惠咧，咁如果個價錢三蚊，噉我哋會補貼翻中間個差價啦。咁長者嗰度咧，電車其實一路以嚟都係佢會有一個仲低過兩蚊嘅，即係票價就畀呢一啲。

130
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:33,500
誒長者啦，咁其實政府咧對於誒電車嗰個營運嘅資助咧，我哋係都喺安全角度出發咧。其實早幾年或者到今天咧，其實我哋都有一啲嘅支援畀電車公司嘅。譬如早幾年咧就係一啲配對嘅一啲係我哋路軌嘅圖層，佢有一啲工程做咧，係一啲硬件嘅提升。咁其實都改善到個噪音問題啦，亦。

131
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:53,510
都改善到佢行車嘅時候更加可以穩定。咁另外當中，如果疫情過去幾年啦，當然我哋都有一啲支援啦。咁而過去嗰兩年咧，其實我哋都有一個嘅誒關於路軌維修嘅支援，因為佢喺嗰方面嘅投資咧都比較大啦。咁亦都係牽涉到即係可以加強佢誒營運方面嘅安全。咁所以呢啲咧，我哋都一路有係提供。

132
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:41,530
We also introduced a marriage leave, three days of full pay in case of a wedding, and in two thousand and twenty-five, we just introduced a family care leave, one more day for each employee to take care of their family or in case of special events, unexpected events. We extended the paternity leave from five days, eighty percent eighty percent pay to ten days full pay.

133
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:14,050
Regarding the retirement age, actually, we employ most of our staff after sixty, except in case of health issue. We have increased health control for the staff after sixty, but generally speaking, we will employ most of the drivers after sixty. 好，咁下一位請李振強議員。誒，代主席，當當。

134
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:34,060
公車我細細個已經開始搭啦，即係以前坐坐坐叮叮當當嗰只。啲人話叮叮車，我就覺得係當當車比較Q啲，係啊。噉就其實誒，其實即係見到電車咧，佢哋嗰個嘅投訴率就好低啦，意外率又係超低。其實即係係一個嘅即係借渣嘅價錢，坐緊燒我嘅味。

135
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:54,070
地道嘅一個嘅即係交通工具嚟，咁其實即係特別喺疫情之後啦，即係嗰個嘅即係乘客量叫做下跌啦。咁而家嗰個嘅誒即係小小童加加一毫子係咪啊？即係成人都係加三毫子，咁老人加加兩毫子。其實我都覺得係好剋制，咁剋製得嚟咧，其實我都想問翻。

136
00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:14,080
其實會唔會剋製得滯咧？即係呢個加幅，即係其實我知道，即係如果你加得太多嘅時候，即係可能亦都擔心，喂會唔會乘客量又會下跌，即係下下降。其實即係電車，其實你嘅侷限就係淨係得係港島，咁呢度港島嘅人口就比較增長比較慢，加上有地即係沿線咧，即係港島北嚟講咧都有好多。

137
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:34,090
多嘅一啲嘅即係地鐵嘅站，咁其實依個就一個結構性問題難以解決。噉你又話喂未來又話增加好多一啲嘅系統，包括一啲嘅即係資訊乘客資訊系統啊等等。其實呢啲又再加埋又換路軌啊，係咪又話加人工啊，又去追翻通脹啊？其實你哋你哋點樣可以令？

138
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,440
電車。

139
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,720
多謝。嗯。

140
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,230
幾年咧？你係投放一億落去。

141
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,950
但係，你諗下，其實。

142
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,520
都係一啲流水式，兩個站、三個站。

143
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,990
接近近十年，你哋淨係搞路軌，搞咗兩三次。

144
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,320
That the trams are made in Hong Kong。嗯，好，下一位請陳學鋒議員。

145
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:20,090
喂，係咪可以慳慳就住個荷包去做咧？安全嘅措施要做，但係非安全嘅設施係咪可以偷偷咧攤場嚟做咧？嗱，我自己喺港島咁多年。

146
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:39,840
值得去去表揚，亦事實上佢哋亦都做咗好多功夫，誒包括有唔同機構去包一啲車啊噉樣，誒呢個係令到佢哋嘅收入穩定咗嘅，亦都見到呢段時間咧電車公司嗰個收入開始走向穩定。

147
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:56,480
但係咧，你要問我今次嘅加價咧，即係我我自己覺得係一個雙面刃機熱，即係可以係令你嘅收入增加，亦都可以令你收入減少。點啱講咧？你要知道電車公司嘅營運模式咧，其實唔會有人由堅尼地城坐電車坐到筲箕灣嘅。

148
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:54,100
到真係有信心，今次嘅加幅係可以做到收支平衡，甚至係可以畀你賺多少少錢咧。呢個係第一。今日就我都有啲橋可以畀下嚟嘅，即係希望你哋都都可以聽下。第一就係話，即係其實你哋嘅廣告同埋一啲嘅懷舊車廂係做得幾好。其實好多年代嘅車廂，我哋以前細個嗰陣時坐啲嘅。

149
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:14,110
木頭車廂啦，當然而家仲有少少，而家大部分都係譬如鋁製嘅，即係鋁製嘅車廂。咁好多嘅係列唔同嘅款式嘅年代，你會唔會不定期咁推出喺市面上行仔，而係可收貴啲咧嗰啲嘅票價？呢第一，第二就係會唔會即係設立一啲嘅博物館，可以喺你哋嘅屈地街嗰度？我都講過，其實喺個即係屈地街嘅。

150
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:34,120
上邊可以整到天橋嘅一海濱搭過去係咪啊？無處不旅遊，可以畀人哋旅客瞭解到哦。原來電車嘅維修維護或者電車本身出車嘅時候係咁整喎。因為我見到啲龍友咧係專登趁住你屈地街車廠啲電車出嘅時候咧，特別啲特別嘅車嘅時候咧，佢哋就真係影相。所以如果你，

151
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:54,130
定時定後有啲噉樣嘅，即係話畀人知有啲噉嘅告示，我覺得會好啲。第三就出一啲係一係列嘅車，譬如好簡單，姜圖係列啦、Pokemon係列啦，甚至哪吒係列啦、熊貓係列嘅，係咪啊？嘅嘅嘅列車嘅嘅嗰啲，即係唔係一價半價喎，係一個係列喎，一個series唔同款式嘅，係啊。

152
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:14,140
咁會唔會可以打造咗一個哇？好似一隊軍隊噉樣一隊一隊一隊，即係一即係嚟嚟嚟，令到增加啲旅遊項目，令到即係嗰啲市民旅客都好都有眼前一亮嘅感覺咧。唔該曬，主席。好啊，阿李議員問嘅問題基本上都係關於電車嘅兩大問題，一個就係你而家。

153
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:54,380
So for the first part, we think that in terms of financial viability, this fare increase aims at ensuring the financial viability of Hong Kong tramways for the coming few years. Actually, we have to to fight hard on the different for our different business lines. So first of all, we have to fight hard to retain ridership, passengers, and to even attract more passengers and.

154
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:14,390
generate more fairbox revenues, so this is also what this fare increase is about. And on the other hand, we fight very hard to find all possible new sources of commercial revenues. Advertising, you mentioned the free ride days, which have been very profitable over the past two to three years. Different types of concepts using the tram as a platform and leveraging on the brand of the

155
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:37,240
regarding the museum, you mentioned the idea of having a museum. It's true that every time we have depot visits, people are amazed by what they see in the depot. Actually, our tram depot is one of the latest factories on Hong Kong Island, and I wish we could open open it much more to the public to make it discover to open it to Hong Kong people and to open.

156
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:57,250
Need to visitors and tourists. At the moment, it's very challenging because the depot is packed. We have not so much space, and it is an industrial facility, so it would raise concerns in terms of safety and tourist and visitor safety. But I really hope that we can have some projects in the future to showcase more what we do in the depot, and especially the facts.

157
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:25,040
其實都要讚下地鐵公司喺過去幾年將嗰個飛票電車公司係嘛係電車公司係誒都都要讚下佢咧，將嗰個票務即係非票務收入咧係提到一個比較高嘅水平嘅誒，去到四成咧，其實我諗好多好少公共交通工具能夠做得到誒，呢個我覺得。

158
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,250
回答。

159
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,550
係。

160
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,750
第三咧就係。

161
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,870
好唔該曬陳議員。誒三個問題，我諗都係請電車公司啊，大生。

162
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,850
Your information with hopefully a positive impact in terms of in terms of ridership.

163
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,590
吸引到遊客去做嘅項目，我覺得你哋要諗多啲依一類嘢，先至能夠增加個票務收入咯。

164
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:34,110
係咪有需要噉樣咁頻密去做呢啲噉嘅工程咧？即係我我都想了解究竟點解唔唔分開做咧？

165
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:19,690
regarding the investment projects, we think that they are critical and essential for the safety and the performance of the tram.

166
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:25,060
And that's why we monitor the gap, as I mentioned. With this fare increase over the past ten years, the gap between tram fare and the short bus route, the cheapest bus route on the island, would remain more or less stable in terms of percentage.

167
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:52,930
即係誒，事實上都係要有一啲誒亮點去去增加客流嘅。誒，我同意咧，係電車廠嗰度係一個優勢嚟嘅。點樣將電車廠？我哋一路都提嘅。其實同電車公司提過好多次。嗱，我將電車廠，我哋同阿黑琴主席都研究過。

168
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:20,810
其實電車過往好明顯係因為個票價嘅性價比比較高，導致到好多譬如喺上環坐去中環、中環坐去金鐘兩三個站。你而家噉嘅加幅咧，其實對於其他公共交通工具嚟講咧，你嘅票務嘅性價比咧，雖然你頭先講話仲比嗰啲巴士仲要平。

169
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:44,790
又唔夠快，又冇冷氣，噉你你再加價，其實嗰個優勢就越嚟越少。咁所以我係擔心咧，你再加價咧，係令到你嘅票務收入狀況咧係越嚟越惡劣嘅。呢個你哋點去評估咧？第一，第二咧，我就見到即係電車公司誒。

170
00:31:45,160 --> 00:32:05,170
即係都好肯投放資源落去做一啲即係誒工程啦，去去更新。但係係咪有噉嘅必要咧？嗱，我哋立法會都睇住政府荷包啦，冇錢咪做少啲咯，係咪？你我頭先睇你個數，你今年即即順利後賺一千萬，税後賺一千萬，但係未來。

171
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:13,220
電車廠同中西區點樣去結合起嚟咧？電車廠如果能夠慢慢變成電車博物館，去畀人參觀，再結合埋出邊嗰個批發市場，如果能夠做造成一啲旅遊項目嘅話，其實係增加你哋嘅收入嘅。誒，你哋再可以將一啲即係過往幾代嘅電車。

172
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:33,230
喺度展出，甚至乎如果可以喺路軌上去行走，去收一啲貴少少嘅票價，我相信旅客係受歡迎嘅。你仲要睇到啊，而家其實香港嘅旅客嘅數字不斷上升嘅。誒，每日堅尼地城，你哋嘅電車總站堅尼地城宏都嗰個站係日日都企曬人，呢啲可以吸。

173
00:33:50,330 --> 00:34:10,340
Thank you for these questions. So the first question about the passenger, the impact of the fare increase on the ridership, is a very good question. We think that we monitor it very closely because our point is to remain affordable and cheap means of transportation on Hong Kong Island. This is part of our DNA to be accessible to every all the people.

174
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:45,350
第二個點是，當我們有做獨立調查，我們的乘客，是他們在尋找更高品質的服務。他們的關心是列車數量、列車頻率和乘客資訊。這些是我們乘客的兩大關心。所以基本上，我們認為，如果我們有更多的資源，我們可以提高更多的駕駛。

175
00:34:45,350 --> 00:35:05,360
And we can increase or stabilise or even increase the frequency of the trams, which is the key one of the key competitive edge of tramways. And second point, as I mentioned, in terms of passenger information, the investment that we did and that we are finalising at the moment will help to share more information about the next tram, which will significantly improve the passenger.

176
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,000
啊。

177
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,100
even more.

178
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,920
sometimes.

179
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,690
That we develop in the Trump Company.

180
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,850
唔該曬，Thank you。下一位請嚴光議員。

181
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,550
所以係啲點，and also we we really want to keep a steady rate of investment.

182
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:18,880
咁咧，到誒由二零二零年到二零二四年嘅移民總成本咧，係提高咗，睇呢個數字咧，提高咗百分之六十五嘅。

183
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:08,120
嘅，誒第二個問題咧係誒睇嗰個報告入邊咧，員工嘅成本咧佔到總成本嘅三分之二嘅。

184
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:52,240
which is the reason why we are going to install manganese rails in these curves to be able to renew the manganese rails are more expensive but the frequency of renewal will be will be lower.

185
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:12,080
to avoid in five to ten years to face like a cliff of investment and to have to renew let's say the whole tram track at the same time, so we have to keep this steady pace and significant pace of investment to sustain the tram tram company in in the long run.

186
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:50,400
Trump Museum is challenging, as I mentioned, the depot visits are challenging. It would require significant investment to open the depot to the public due to safety concerns. But we work very significantly on tourism and attractiveness, and we are at the moment, for example, developing new Trump tours.

187
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:39,980
It's true that in some location on the infrastructure we have to renew the tram track very frequently. For example, sorry to be a bit technical, but in some curves, some curves, some curves, have a very small radius and the wearing rate is very high. That's why to prevent any derailment in the curves, we have to renew the tram track every two, three, four.

188
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:34,290
What about the third question? We regarding extra effort to increase the non-ticket, non-fare type of revenue, such as considering the tram museum etc. So the tram museum, as I mentioned, increasing the non-fare box revenue is very critical for us. We did a lot and we aim at doing.

189
00:36:50,680 --> 00:37:10,690
Based on our trameramic, we are partnering with a shop, a Chinese traditional dress shop, Shepa. Sorry for the the bad Chinese accent. To have tours with the visitors dressed in Chinese traditional dress to take photos and very something very Instagrammable and very valuable for Hong Kong. So this is these are this type of initiatives.

190
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:37,630
多謝主席。誒咁呢次電車公司申請加價咧，係介乎嗰個兩毫子到六毫子之間咧。對於市民嚟講咧，相信咧唔會構成咧誒大嘅負擔嘅。但係咧誒，針對嗰個加幅嚟講，噉啊呢次咧對於六十五歲誒之上嘅長者嘅加幅係最大嘅。誒。

191
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:57,640
達到誒百分之十五點四嘅，咁咧我咧係對呢個咧有誒有疑問嘅。咁咧對於啲冇收入收入能力嘅加幅係最大嘅。咁咧誒電梯公司都未靠呢個加呢個兩毫子咧可以賺大錢嘅，所以希望咧係將呢個咧誒對長者加幅咧可以降到百分之十以下。

192
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:39,170
咁咧，如果按照prolata嘅話咧，係咪誒你員工嘅成本咧都係差唔多增加咗百分之六十五左右嘅？如果係嘅話咧，誒除非你員工係增加好多嘅，如果唔係嘅話咧，噉你應該你誒電梯公司員工嘅salary嘅嗰個加幅咧，應該係全香港。

193
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,530
increase.

194
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,020
The pre-COVID subsidy.

195
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,630
since the economy and the world has come back to normal, we the

196
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,890
三個問題，好。三個問題，我諗啊，副秘書長都係請電車公司答㗎啦，係咪？哦，噉啊，大生。

197
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:47,470
當最高嘅，佢總共咧四四年咧加咗百分之五十以上嘅，噉你呢個方面咧係希望咧誒電力公司去澄清一下嘅。

198
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:43,640
So, regarding the first part of the question, actually we increased. We propose an increase of 20 cents for the senior fare and 10 cents for the child fare.

199
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:17,950
好，主席，我都我哋有冇跟進？誒，再次重申咧，就係話加寬咧嗰個錢咧係唔多嘅，但係咧社會觀感咧係唔好嘅，最希望咧誒電力公司再次考慮啦嚇。

200
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:23,670
對啦，誒特色嘅電車線路啊，呢啲都係考慮嘅方向。誒，我想問一問咧，誒對於邊一啲新業務咧，依家誒電車公司係最有把握嘅，係誒最注重咧，誒要係開發嘅。

201
00:40:45,350 --> 00:41:01,530
Hong Kong government helped the company to sustain during this very difficult time for Hong Kong, as it did for other public transport operator. So what you can see in the paper are the net operating costs, not the gross operating costs. Meaning that if you

202
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:44,980
Over time came back to the pre-COVID level, and the third component is that we significantly, as I mentioned, increased the salaries. But most of the impact, most of the 65% that you mentioned, is due to the base effect, the reference effect for 2020, which takes into account the pre-COVID

203
00:41:47,460 --> 00:42:04,660
And regarding our activity, we are the most confident in. As I mentioned, at the moment we work a lot on tourism-related activities, trying to develop tourism product and develop the connections regarding tourism. And we hope that it can generate significant increases in revenues in the coming years, even if it will require a lot of work.

204
00:38:47,750 --> 00:39:07,760
誒第三個咧係誒睇到咧廣告嘅收入咧佔咗公司總收入嘅接近一半啦嚇。咁咧誒報告都講咧未來咧提升嗰個廣告收入嘅個空間係非常之有限嘅。咁咧啱啱咧誒電車公司都介紹咗㗎啦。咁咧你誒新嘅業務咧，譬如話咧電車排

205
00:39:43,920 --> 00:40:03,930
Last time it was the opposite. It was twenty cents for child fare and ten cents for senior fare. So if you look in the over long term perspective, the kind of ratio between the senior fare and the adult fare would remain more or less stable between forty three to forty seven percent over the past ten years. So in the long run, the senior fare increase.

206
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:23,940
The senior fares are similar compared to the adult fare. It's just that we either had the choice to propose 0.1 or 0.2. It would have been very difficult to propose 0.15, which means that this time the proposal for the senior fare is higher in percentage than for the adult fare. But it was the opposite for the last, the latest fare.

207
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:45,350
所以那係第一點，就係關乎運營成本增加。我想要強調嘅係，喺《香港交通及物流局》嘅報告中，佢哋嘅運營成本喺二零二零年包括一個香港政府嘅補貼，一個受新冠影響嘅補貼。我哋非常感激。

208
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,840
好。

209
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,420
第一位老人，老人嘅價格嚇，係好啊。

210
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:42,550
So regarding the first part, in terms of local versus visitors, we reckon that we have around 15 to 20% of visitors and tourists riding our trams on a daily basis, which is quite significant. And we have been the COVID period has been a good test. I mean to check this this assessment.

211
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:22,030
set aside the subsidy, the operating cost in 2020 would be higher, and the increase from 2020 to 2024 would be lower. So this is the first part. Second part is that during the COVID period, we reduced the overtime of our drivers because we adapted the service, the frequency of the service and overall.

212
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:43,180
好啊！下一位係請張欣宇議員。哦，OK。啊，多謝主席。噉啊，我我首先其實我想表達咧，我係支持今次嘅加價申請嘅，因為我覺得其實個加幅啊，即係如果睇百分比咧，好似就高，但係對於市民嚟講，真正畀出去嘅係畀嗰個實際嘅銀碼啊嘛。

213
00:42:43,180 --> 00:43:03,190
咁如果你睇實際嘅五碼嘅話咧，其實個加幅係講緊一毫子、兩毫子、三毫子，咁呢個數字其實係相當誒有限嘅，你甚至乎係話好非常温和嘅。噉我哋睇翻電車公司個成本嗰筆數、嗰個帳，佢經營嘅狀況其實係清清楚楚，個理據係非常之明。

214
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:23,200
確噉啊！我亦都係誒都有留意翻呢個加價嘅新聞出咗嚟之後，其實喺無論係網上啦，或者我哋坊間去問翻啲啊實際嘅使用者、啲市民嘅睇法啦，其實大家都係覺得支持嘅，應該好少係會有啲公共交通工具加價喺市民層面咧，大家覺得係。

215
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:43,210
合理嘅，因為點解？因為叮叮車其實已經唔止係一個公共交通工具咁簡單。作為香港市民，大家都希望佢係可以可持續噉樣營經營落去。大家亦都知道，如果再係即係唔畀你有個合理嘅加價或者係個一個一個批准嘅話咧，其實有機會可能佢未必係可可。

216
00:43:43,210 --> 00:44:03,220
持續嘅叮叮車，按照而家嘅嗰個個做法，而呢個我哋係都唔想見到嘅，因為其實佢已經係一個城市嘅文化同埋個招牌。咁所以咧，我想表達我對呢個加價支持嘅一個態度。噉我都想探討下咧，其實關於未來即係叮叮車嘅嗰個電車嘅路向啦。其實我哋都知道，其實如果純粹用通勤嘅交通，

217
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:23,230
通勤本地通勤嘅嗰個誒需求嚟講咧，呢度係挑戰好大嘅，因為誒即係無論係我哋嘅嗰個覆蓋啦，嗰個本身嘅誒嗰個效率啦，或同埋港島區整體嘅人口啦，我相信大家都見到，其實呢個將來唔會係一啲好樂觀嘅因素。咁誒，咁呢部分咧，其實。

218
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:43,240
即係如果我哋純粹係誒，即係淨係去發揮或者睇重佢通勤commuting嘅呢個價值咧，其實係誒呢個挑戰好大嘅。但係咧，其實佢真正嘅誒嗰個啊嗰個嗰個潛力咧，其實在於佢係香港，尤其係港島一個文化一個招牌。咁呢樣嘢其實係可以轉變轉化成為。

219
00:44:43,240 --> 00:45:03,250
一個旅遊嘅資源同埋一個旅遊嘅價值，咁呢一度咧，其實係有一個附加嘅價值，有個附加嘅一個增值咧，係可以去我哋可以去capture啊，可以去攞到嘅。噉啊，都見到呢幾年其實喺呢方面，其實誒電車嘅誒努力都唔少，同埋亦都係市場係接受嘅。而家好多遊客嚟到香港都會專登走嘅。

220
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,090
從從遊客和訪客。

221
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,250
好唔該曬，下一位請郭偉強議員。

222
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,540
誒電車公司嘅一啲回應，第一個咧就係。

223
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,640
誒，所以剛才有同事都提過，誒。

224
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:03,220
處同埋路政處都即時跟進，誒加咗一啲圍欄啊，或者喺某啲位置咧加強咗一啲。

225
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:24,100
主席誒，事實上咧，電車嘅經營係艱難嘅啊。雖然誒兩蚊乘車長者係好歡喜，不過其他交通工具嘅兩蚊乘車咧，電車用唔到。

226
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:36,050
電車嘅價格優勢係比其他交通工具嘅兩蚊乘車係大大壓縮咗嘅。喺咁艱難嘅環境底下，電車仍然維持運作，我係感恩嘅。

227
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:16,140
誒誒處理安全隱患嘅措施，我哋都係感謝嘅。咁但係就住誒一啲未改善咧喺度，希望提出嚟聽下誒運輸處同埋。

228
00:47:45,920 --> 00:48:02,410
And to jump to your second question regarding smart driving, so we are doing first steps in this direction by introducing more digital technologies. As I mentioned, we will install cameras on the tram to record more videos and use use it as investigation and training materials.

229
00:48:53,510 --> 00:49:12,600
對於加價當然唔希望啊，即係市民一定唔希望有加價。咁但係事實上要保持維持電車嘅運作咧，佢亦都只能加價啊。呢個所以就冇即係喺我哋嘅角度就理論上就好難話反對嘅啊，亦都冇得反對，除非你唔要電車嘅啫。

230
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:23,260
電車呢度去打卡啦，或者影相啊。咁呢度其實目前嚟講，我哋我我覺得我哋喺呢方面仲有好多嘅潛力係可以去揾嘅。噉啊，所以會唔會其實而家你哋手頭上都掌握啲數據，或者有啲市場分析？而家搭我哋呢個電車嘅嗰個比例啊，例如本地乘客真係通勤嘅比例，同埋一個遊客過嚟。

231
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:43,270
係體驗呢個噉樣嘅誒嗰個方式嘅一個比例，大約係誒係幾多？同埋點樣有咩方法可以更加進一步係將遊客嗰度嘅旅遊價值咧係可以更加去增值啦？咁呢個係一方面。咁另外一方面咧，都想講喺交通嘅技術嚟講咧，其實而家喺嗰個智能駕駛啊，即係喺嗰個我哋。

232
00:45:43,270 --> 00:46:03,280
唔係講緊無人駕駛，咁呢啲公共交通工具呢個仲有誒比較遠嘅距離啊。咁但係嗰智能輔助駕駛，令到我哋嘅司機其實揸呢啲車嘅時候可以更加安全、更加輕鬆啊，同埋亦都你仲容易揾到更加適合嘅司機。嗰個培訓方面嘅嗰個嗰個效率都可以更加高。咁其實呢一個咧都已經係去到。

233
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:23,290
一個好先進同埋一個進步得好快嘅階段，咁電車公司會唔會都考慮喺呢方面係同誒，即係去做翻一個誒投入啦，或者探討啦，令到將來我哋嗰個人力資源方面嘅嗰個誒投入個效益咧，都可以更加高。多謝主席。好，唔該曬誒兩組問題誒，係咪請電車公司啊，大生回答？

234
00:46:43,100 --> 00:47:03,110
Our visitors, the point, the main point for us in terms of economy and business model is that the visitors are ready to pay much more than three dollars or three three dollars to take the trams, whereas the locals are much more price sensitive. So the question is how to how to say extract the value and get more value from these tourists and these visitors, and this is the reason why we.

235
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:23,120
We want to try to develop new products because if we want to extract to get more value, we have to offer something more to these visitors. We have the tramoramic that I mentioned that we are refurbishing at the moment, and for example, from eight different from audio guides in eight different languages, we will have sixteen different languages, including Arabic, for example, to address Arabic.

236
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:43,130
阿拉伯-speaking visitors, and these are the type of tours that we want to develop. At the moment, for example, today my team is in India with the tourism board in a tourism fair to try to develop connections as well with overseas travel agencies and channel them directly to our special tram tours to really feed this pipe in terms.

237
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:22,840
Regarding most advanced technologies, we had some tests. However, the difficulty would be to extend to generalise this kind of technologies to one hundred and sixty-five trams. Our fleet is quite large, and in terms of cost efficiency, it could still be very expensive compared to the benefits. So the return on investment has not been proven at the moment, but

238
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,470
意見。

239
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,730
This is something that we closely monitor.

240
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:25,140
電單車以致私家車進入個路車改，所以導致到加安全隱患。

241
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,680
前少少咧，二零一九年咧，有電單車咧，因為佢要喺條路軌度出入咧。

242
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:20,050
回應一下，你點樣處理呢啲誒其他嘅車輛，包括單車？

243
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:28,480
誒喺舊年啊誒二零二四年嘅十一月咧，就曾經有誒。

244
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:47,770
喺金鐘咧就有單車咧，就誒即係左穿右插咧，就橫跨雙白線咧，就入咗電車路噉啊，係炒咗車嘅。咁其實都反映咗咩咧？反映咗咧嗰啲單車咧，而家因為貪行電車路方便咧，就

245
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:48,570
都係主席，我唔係呢個委員會嘅委員，但係都係主席畀我發言啦。咁因為上一屆其實我都係港島區嘅立法會議員。誒幾樣嘢嘅，第一就係誒電車一定係我哋香港島，甚至乎成個香港一個特色嘅交通工具啦。誒電車能夠繼續營運就係最好嘅保育方法啦。

246
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:56,340
亦都感謝電車公司嘅誒，即係同事啦、誒車長啦、維修誒技工啦嘅付出嘅係啦。咁喺舊年嘅年底咧，我就做過一個誒記者發佈，就係關注一啲誒電車嗰個道路上嘅安全隱患。咁運輸。

247
00:50:48,050 --> 00:51:08,060
出出入入，出出入入，涉來涉去，其實車長係好難睇到佢哋嘅嚇。咁所以其實誒執法部門有冇同警方或者誒點樣溝通過，可以加強呢方面嘅執法誒，防止一啲電單車又好，單車又好咧，行駛電車路咧，因為再推。

248
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:33,970
啱啱嗰日又落雨咧，綫胎咧，佢一壓嗰條路軌咧就綫低咗。其實橫跨嗰個路軌係唔係太適當嘅做法，特別係單車同埋電單車。希望誒誒部門都能夠留意去誒做一個跟進。咁另外第二個誒安全隱患咧就係。

249
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:54,300
舊年連續兩單啦，二零二四年嘅八月咧就有私家車喺灣仔入坑入咗一個維修坑，咁二零二四年十二月咧又有一架的士咧喺鰂魚湧入咗個維修坑，咁都想了解翻究竟維修嘅時候啦，維修一定要做嘅，咁但係維修嘅時候有咩辦法？

250
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:14,310
再提高嗰個意識，或者引起駕駛人士嘅注意，而防止入坑咧，都係主席好啊。誒兩條問題都係誒屬於安全隱患嘅關注。咁喺呢一方面誒，請副秘書長啊，定係運輸處嘅代表去。

251
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:45,780
副秘書長係都係主席，多謝各議員嘅意見啦。咁亦都好多謝各議員，即係舊年提出好多有用意見。咁其實誒，處方我哋處方同埋路政署咧，都喺現場同電車公司一齊咧，係就住有啲站咧，的確嗰個行人安全方面，我哋加強咗，加咗啲圍欄。咁亦都多謝各議員意見。咁另外就係話，如果有陣時可能有一啲。

252
00:52:45,780 --> 00:53:05,790
誒安全嘅問題，譬如話有啲駕駛者可能佢誤入咗嗰個電車嗰個誒軌道嘅空間。咁其實呢方面咧，我哋會係睇下點樣可以誒做多啲嘅標示，即係提醒一啲駕駛人士嗰度可能係會係電車軌。咁呢方面行人嗰度我哋都會做，即係運輸署已經有喺可能喺一啲站中間咧就加咗啲紅色。

253
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:25,800
留意乘客啊，留意電車啊，咁呢啲噉嘅標示咧，我諗我哋會去繼續去喺唔同嘅情況咧，儘量做可以係加強翻嗰個駕駛者留意翻個路軌喺嗰度個安全喺嗰度嚇。嗯，好咁喺呢方面，唔知電車公司誒代表對於呢一類嘅安全隱患有冇一啲誒？

254
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,770
好。

255
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,860
繼續努力，增加收入，唔該。

256
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,100
下一位請姚柏良副主席。

257
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:17,390
百分之五十七個percent嘅收益咧，係嚟自即係非票務嘅。

258
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:58,640
咁喺呢方面我都想問一問政府咧，其實就我記得誒喺二二年五月份，即係上次申請加價嘅時候，我都特別問到當時嘅副秘書長，即係其實。

259
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:10,480
點樣去加強對遊客呢方面嘅一個業務？多謝。好好啊，噉啊就住頭先嘅兩條問題，第一條請副秘書長回應啊，第二條就請電梯公司啊，大生誒一間回應。

260
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:12,110
又唔影響到即係正常嘅一個日常即係交通工具通勤嘅呢方面嘅一個功能，呢個我想問政府。咁當然我都想問一問誒電車公司一個問題啦，其實就睇到而家大概百分之五十。

261
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:29,950
可持續噉樣穩健、可持續噉樣運營咧，係非常之重要嘅。因為咧，香港電車咧真係有一百二十一年嘅歷史，係一個活生生嘅喺路上行走緊嘅一個即係古董嘅。

262
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:49,320
呢個即係交通工具，咁呢個非常之具香港嘅特色。即係頭先都介紹到啦，香港電車係即係本地設計、本地組裝、本地維護，咁其實好在地嘅，咁所以話好值得去保育同埋咧係支持佢穩健嘅營運。

263
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:49,000
I share the we share the same observation. Actually, the tram environment is extremely challenging. This is a very busy area. We have only thirty percent of dedicated lane, and most of the time we have to share the road with other road users, with private cars, taxis and pedestrians. So that's why we are in very close communication with the transport department.

264
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:09,010
With the highways department, we raise the risks and the potential risks that we observe on the tram line. They also have to cope, I guess, with the, I mean, the constraints coming from the other road users. And we are in a continuous improvement mindset, trying to use the, I mean, the situation that we meet to improve day after.

265
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:29,020
the safety of our tram line, and we are working at the moment on a safety campaign that we would like to display on our trams to raise awareness of pedestrians and of cyclists or motorcyclists about the trams. Because sometimes trams have a friendly image, so people could think that trams are slow and are not so dangerous. But we have to raise a bit the awareness of the public about

266
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:49,030
the risk of the tram and the fact that being on the tram lane can be dangerous。嗯，好。誒，主席，郭議員，好快有冇啲咩？係第一運輸處嗰度咧，希望真係同警方多聯係，希望加強有關嘅執法。另外，第二咧冇乜嘢，就係想賺一賺。其實電車公司嘅民創都做得唔錯，希望誒。

267
00:54:54,430 --> 00:55:14,440
誒，都係主席，主席，我都認為即係今次呢個加價咧，係相對係温和可接受嘅。咁特別係喺個月票價格都係保持不變，呢個對於即係誒平時係主要靠電車通勤嘅呢方面嘅影響都係即係唔會帶嚟一個影響啦。咁誒，我一路都認為咧，即係電車咧，即係嗰個。

268
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:19,020
電車頭先誒代電車公司代表都講到啦，即係就算而家誒疫情之後恢復到一定嘅遊客嘅情況下，其實旅客佔嗰個乘客嘅比例，即係都係大概十二十個percent甚至二十個percent度。咁其實暫時嚟講未算一個好高嘅比例，但係睇到。

269
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:39,030
未來個方向就係話，如果電車公司純粹靠呢個票務個收入同埋一啲嘅廣告個收入嘅話咧，呢個係即係未來都好難去持續維持嘅。咁喺呢個政策上邊嚟講，有冇去同即係去諗下，即係喺喺未來個營運上邊？

270
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,450
頭先個問題。

271
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,580
第二條問題，請電車公司啊，大生回應。

272
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,960
and at the moment, tourism represents, I mean the

273
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:23,810
Because even if we create these new tools, if the awareness is not there, it's meaningless. We are also investing in the social social media.

274
01:01:48,270 --> 01:02:04,710
先搭。如果庫備資金有補充嘅，可以再打搭。因為電車就行軌行軌道嘅，咁所以基本上自動化駕駛即係應用嘅機會就應該高。不過就香港人煙稠密，可能帶來好大挑戰。我請阿戴生電車公司代表就回應下。

275
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:29,340
可能旗袍嗰個噉嘅傳統，配合翻電車個旅遊個體驗，點樣可以做一啲創新嘅產品？咁呢方面咧，佢哋其實都繼續會做。咁亦都我哋會鼓勵，亦都係如果佢哋有需要咧，我哋係絕對願意咧。我哋係可能同唔同部門一齊誒夾埋一齊諗下計，點樣可以能夠成件事係做得更加好啊！好。

276
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:59,040
因為佢具備一個旅遊嘅功能，或者可以講話，即係其實都有條件可以申請作為一個景點噉樣嘅營運嘅。即係喺目前作為公共交通工具嘅角度，即係仲有冇啲政策上嘅空間，係畀佢喺營運上邊能夠更有彈性、更靈活咁去推出新嘅，即係同旅遊相關嘅產品而。

277
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:37,680
咁但係就誒都睇到電車公司好努力噉，即係推出一啲電車全景遊啦，一全新派對電車啦。咁喺呢方面，其實我覺得都仲係可以有空間去多啲去即係創新一啲嘅體驗，同埋推多啲嘅不同類型嘅產品，同旅發局又好，同我哋旅遊業界。

278
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:57,690
又好去加強個合作，一齊去吸多啲旅客嚟誒乘搭電車。呢個其實非常之有賣點嘅。咁但係呢方面即係其實目前嚟講，呢方面嘅收益其實佔你一個非票務嘅收益裏邊係大概幾多percent咧？即係呢，我都想了解下。咁仲有冇空間，同埋你哋有冇具體嘅計劃未來點？

279
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:30,770
唔該，副秘書長。誒，唔該曬副主席嗰個意見啦。咁其實咧，就對於電車嗰個支援咧，噉我哋政府咧，其實主要就係喺佢嗰個硬件營運方面咧，我哋其實頭先提到咧，我哋都有一啲嘅支援，即係話，譬如考慮到佢可以點樣加強個安全營運啦，加強佢整體嗰個系統嗰個誒人。

280
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:50,780
性啦，咁所以呢度咧，我哋其實近年我哋喺嗰個路軌維修嗰方面咧，其實我哋有一啲嘅支援畀佢。咁希望咧喺營運嗰度可以幫佢少少噉，等佢整體個營運，譬如話可以推動其他嘅一啲誒非票務嘅收入上咧，嗰個空間個彈性會更加大。咁亦都頭先聽到大家好多好好嘅意見，點樣可以喺旅遊嗰方面加強同電車結。

281
00:58:50,780 --> 00:59:10,790
合啦，咁呢方面，電車公司陣間可能都可以再介紹下。其實佢哋同誒旅遊發展局咧就係一個緊密合作。咁亦都頭先誒電車公司提到咧，佢哋未來就住一啲新興嘅旅遊嘅市場，可能係中東啦或者係印度啦，噉佢哋都會嘗試去加強做啲宣傳，同埋都結合咧佢哋有一個新嘅創意，就係可能結合翻本地一啲傳統。

282
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:55,980
Thank you. As has been mentioned, actually, in terms of tourism, we have to work on two sides. The first side being the supply, and the second side being the demand. So, in terms of supply, it is about, as we mentioned, developing new products based on our trams, new types of tram tours, new packages for the tourists to live different experiences and, if possible, Instagrammable.

283
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:15,990
experiences in Hong Kong, and the second is to connect these packages and these products to the demand, and that's the reason why we work even more closely. We have been working over the past few months even more closely with the tourism board to come with them at international fairs for the travel agencies in the world to be aware of our tourameric of these tour.

284
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:16,960
好。

285
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:08,910
好。

286
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:17,980
啊！

287
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,170
阿戴先生。

288
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,280
喺呢方面，你哋咧有咩睇法咧？

289
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,420
下一位請葉劉淑儀議員。

290
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,150
This policy, this neutrality policy for Hong Kong, Sharmois.

291
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:15,460
Based on the technologies developed in the mainland, for example, but at the moment it's still very challenging.

292
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:07,560
政府機構公益嘅活動，誒，佢可唔可以畀我哋買下告白，同埋會唔會有啲特價咁咧？

293
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:44,130
For example, we have now an account on the Little Red Book, and we are also very intensively promoting tramways on Douyin. Sorry for the accent, but the Chinese Chinese TikTok through partnerships with key opinion leaders to create some buzz and some attractiveness on all the different markets, which could attract visitors to our tourism product.

294
01:00:48,240 --> 01:01:08,250
旅遊業專門部分代表幾percent of our revenues，但係我們真係希望它可以擴展喺未來。因為tramway係某啲獨特喺香港，你唔可以喺度揾到叮叮或者類似叮叮嘅嘢，喺全世界。所以我們真係要喺度利用呢啲獨特嘅特色。好，唔該曬。下一位請。

295
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:28,260
嚴江議員，第二輪發言誒三分鐘。好多謝主席，簡單誒，我想跟進一下嗰個電車嘅個自動化駕駛嘅嗰個時間表。咁咧，請問咧政府或者係電車公司咧，對於電車嘅自動化駕駛咧，有冇咩最新嘅規劃？誒，會唔會咧，儘快可以？

296
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:48,270
實現咧電車係香港嘅自動化駕駛。而國內咧，誒幾個城市咧，春節誒嗰個的士咧已經開始自動化駕駛㗎啦，上路㗎啦。咁咧，如果咧我哋電車可以盡快咧自動化駕駛嘅話，我諗住咧會吸引更多嘅乘客去體驗嘅。唔該。好，呢個請電車公司。

297
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:30,310
Actually, autonomous trams are a dream for engineers, but in the real life and in our very busy environment, it's extremely it would be extremely challenging. As I mentioned, we operate in maybe one of the most the most dense environment in the world. There are many pedestrians crossing the line at all every time, jaywalkers.

298
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:50,320
Even our stations are very narrow, so the question if we had an autonomous tram would be to calibrate the algorithm and for the algorithm to recognise when a tram is when a pedestrian is just a regular client and when a pedestrian is a danger. If the algorithm is too sensitive, it means that the tram would stop all the time and it would impact the performance.

299
01:02:50,320 --> 01:03:10,330
If the algorithm is not sensitive enough, it could be a concern in terms of safety. So at the moment, I am not sure the technologies are ready yet to cope with these very constraining and challenging types of environment. But of course, this is something that we monitor, and maybe in the very long term future, this could be one option for tramways.

300
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:40,870
四分鐘。誒，我有個簡單嘅問題問下電車公司嘅啫，都係有關佢哋嘅收入啊。即係阿姚議員都問佢哋可唔可以同誒票務以外多啲嘅廣告啊，其他嘅收入啦。咁有個問題，我以前都問過㗎啦。咁其實我哋啲政黨政團就好中意電車嘅。

301
01:03:40,870 --> 01:04:00,880
因為佢行得慢啊嘛嚇，噉啊如果將我哋啲相啊咁貼上去咧，噉啊好有幫助嘅。咁但記得當年咧係電車公司就話佢唔賣政治告白嘅嚇。咁想問下今日佢哋嘅誒立場係點咧？即係如果唔係誒政治告白，純粹一啲誒所謂非政，

302
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:29,250
呢個誒，我諗誒兩方面都可以回應下嘅，就先請電車公司啊，大生回應下你哋嗰個誒立場，或者係嗰個誒準則會唔會有改變？政治廣告可唔可以賣，或者係其他啲非政府機構嘅廣告可唔可以賣？第二就如果係秘書長、副秘書長，即係就。

303
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:55,390
The long-term policy and the policy of Hong Kong tramways for a very long time has been to be neutral, politically speaking, and not to advertise for any political parties on the trams, not to take any side in the debate. This is not—we are a transportation company. We are not. This is not our goal and our mission to take sides in the political debate in Hong Kong.

304
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:47,590
噉。

305
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,220
電車公司代表又大聲。

306
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:54,460
咁或者請誒電車公司嘅大生先回應，或者係副秘書長稍後都可以誒簡單回應下。

307
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:06,340
誒嗱，葉阿葉劉淑儀議員有冇跟進？誒，我會同公司跟進。係好，好啊。會後可以繼續跟進。會後跟進嚇。好，好啊。噉啊。

308
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:30,460
On the other end, our commercial revenues depend on the economic context, the financial situation of corporate clients. So, any reliable long-term forecast is challenging to establish and subject to many uncertainties.

309
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:55,400
咁而家政府當然，我哋有咗好多宣傳嘅活動咧，其實都會喺電車嗰度賣廣告嘅嚇。咁誒，但係如果你話整體上就住個別嗰個實際上嗰個運作嗰個守則咧，就可能要睇翻個別嗰個營辦商佢自己嘅一啲考慮啦。

310
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:55,790
meaningful, how to say, missions or causes to the public. We we have partnerships, either partnerships or commercial discounts. This this is something which is possible, and actually that we encourage to really bring something more to the community.

311
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:13,180
我噉我想問下，如果係一啲民間嘅組織宣傳，譬如話誒，climate change、sustainability呢啲，法國都好支持嘅。噉啊，誒電車公司會唔會畀我哋登啲廣告，同埋會唔會有一個係即係一個好啲嘅rate咁咧嚇？

312
01:04:55,390 --> 01:05:15,400
We have advertising for the government or for government departments, agencies or for NGOs, provided that they respect. We have some criteria to respect in terms of to make sure that the advertising is not offensive or that's I mean kind of guidelines from the advertising sector. But at this stage, we are we stick on this.

313
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:40,880
好誒，第二個問誒誒副秘書長會唔會補充下？誒多謝主席，多謝議員意見。咁呢度咧，其實就就住每個唔同公交咧，噉佢哋自己誒下邊有一啲非票務收入、啲廣告嗰啲安排咧，都係佢哋即係自己有一個內部嘅守則咧。我知架，我知道佢哋自己就會跟住去做啦。咁

314
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:38,300
regarding NGOs or civic organisation, as I mentioned in the presentation, we have we had a lot of partnerships in the past with NGOs or with local community. For example, for Chinese New Year, we had a partnership with the Children Cancers Children Foundation to have a special Chinese New Year Trump for this NGO. So for this type of non-political organisation promoting

315
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:26,750
依家落嚟，我我本人發言咧，咁其實我就誒聽到誒各位委員同事都表達咗，住大部分都係支持加價㗎啦。噉啊，即係有有好多理由，我都唔重複啦。咁但係我想問呢個問題就係喺上次電車公司申請加價時，我都問過類似，就今次咧就。

316
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:46,760
無論你話叫做剋制嘅加幅，或者係加幅大噉，即係純粹數字啦。噉啊，我哋有啲議員同事都問話加得夠唔夠啊？咁咁嗱，按照你而家呢個加幅嘅建議咧，你哋預測喺二零二五、二零二六或者未來三年嘅個盈利嗰邊大致上會係點咧？當然，如果你覺得，

317
01:07:46,760 --> 01:08:06,770
呢啲公司秘密噉，咁呢個都理解。但係我因為涉及到公共交通服務，噉啊，如果係政府要審你呢個加價申請嘅時候，都要考慮到按照乘客量大致不變作為一個情景，誒成本你可以預測得到㗎啦，通脹預測得到㗎啦，人工嗰啲大致上都估到，因此。

318
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:42,530
好。

319
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:58,750
好。

320
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,960
參考。

321
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,390
好，我哋下一行嘅議題咧就係。

322
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:53,510
提升及優化行人過路設施。

323
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:08,710
噉我哋今次誒就住呢一個香港電車有限公司嘅加價申請呢個議題咧，我哋都誒進行咗一個小時有多嘅討論。

324
01:09:50,750 --> 01:10:01,610
transportation sectors, we have to leverage on all sources of revenue. So of course, non-firebox revenue, and we will keep working on this, but also the firebox revenues, which are the reason for for this fare increase.

325
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:43,870
嘅渠道收集嘅意見底下，噉你哋會作一個通盤嘅誒考慮同埋分析啊。噉就誒，我哋今次呢個討論咧到此就結束啦。噉就多謝政府當局嘅代表，亦多謝電車公司嘅代表誒。

326
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:57,670
客咧都會係繼續係即係受歡迎嘅，繼續都會係用電車呢個服務。咁呢方面，我哋繼續會同電車公司保持即係緊密嘅溝通，亦都監察住佢嘅營運。咁睇下，希望佢可以喺其他嘅非票務收入咧，可以做得更加好，咁維持翻個長遠嘅財務嘅可持續性。

327
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:26,780
似，如果你加呢個加幅，假如係誒，即係批准咗之後，你未來嚟嘅二零二五、二六、二七嗰個盈利嘅情況點樣？點解我問呢個問題咧？我注意到你今年二零二四年誒有個税後盈利增加到一百四十八點九嘅百分點啊，咁實際上又有一次性嘅廣告咧。

328
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:47,200
嘅收入就入咗嘅，噉你二零二五、二六有冇呢個預算咧？可能冇咗嘅話，咁究竟你到時係都係誒蝕錢啦，定係即係加咗價之後咧，又或者都係打個平啦？咁會唔會好快又要即係翻翻嚟，又要同我哋本會去去討論呢一個加價嘅嘅議題啦？

329
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:18,180
So first of all, I would like to mention that financial forecasts are very difficult to establish for our company, as we navigate in a very complex environment. Our revenues depend on many external factors regarding the farebox revenue and ridership. It depends on the office vacancy rate on Hong Kong Island, the population of Hong Kong Island, inbound outbound flows of visitors and local residents.

330
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:50,750
Our goal with this fare increase is for tramways to maintain a minimal profit margin in the coming years, very likely positive, to be able to confidently invest both in our staff and in our assets, and to maintain the activity in a positive dynamic. So this is and to maintain this slight reasonable profits given the current trend in salary increases in the

331
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:22,110
好，副秘書長可唔可以簡單回應下？或者我補充少少，主席其實就頭先，我哋都提到咧，睇到誒長遠嚟講咧，的確即係受制幾個因素啦，即係港島區嘅人口啦，同埋係其他嘅公共交通工具競爭咧。誒，我哋睇翻可能即係佢嗰個誒票務收入或者乘客量大幅提升嘅空間咧。

332
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:42,120
個係有限嘅，咁可能未來幾年咧，我哋預計都會大致係保持平穩。咁但係即係睇翻咧，電車其實都有自己嗰個獨特嘅優勢啦。咁除咗佢有特色之外咧，頭先大家都提到佢本身個站都相對密嘅。咁如果港島北大家其實個班次都頻密啦，亦都係相對平啦，有競爭力。咁短程嘅旅客咧，其實我哋相信嘅成

333
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:29,000
噉啊！頭先我啲委員同事咧喺發言同埋提名嘅時候咧，都誒大多數都表示理解電車公司個經營嘅情況，而對於誒本次嘅加價申請咧，佢哋都基本支持嘅。咁咁當然咧，就誒政府當局就今次聽咗我哋嗰啲意見，咁稍後連同埋咧其他。

334
01:11:53,790 --> 01:12:13,800
政府當局提供嘅文件就C.B.庫三二零零斜棟二零二五庫零四號文件，同埋另外一個就係立法會秘書處移備嘅背景資料簡介，就係C.B.庫三二零零斜棟二零二五庫零五號文件嘅。噉我想請誒工作人員邀請政府當局嘅代表進入會議室。

335
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,150
簡稱發聲裝置。

336
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,310
我而家首先介紹發聲裝置嘅部分。

337
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:54,210
同埋更新黃波燈兩個部分嘅。

338
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,110
故障率咧有上升嘅趨勢，因此咧就需要更換。

339
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,750
我哋今日會向委員會介紹兩項正在進行中嘅。

340
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:13,220
電子行人過路發聲裝置為視障人士提示行人。

341
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:20,400
運輸署已經委託咗機電工程處更換全港嘅公共道路上誒斑馬線過路處嘅傳統黃波燈。

342
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:29,260
文書處已經為咗呢兩項工程咧，就取得咗撥款啦，並會以現有嘅資源承擔日後嘅經常性開支。

343
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:29,890
誒為提升行人過路設施嘅二行道咧，替做行人友善嘅環境，並推動步行成為可持續嘅綠色出行模式。

344
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:06,910
行人過路設施更新計劃分別係行人過路處嘅電子行人過路發聲裝置及公共道路上嘅斑馬線嘅黃波燈。

345
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:51,270
運輸署藉住呢次更換老化嘅發聲裝置嘅契機咧，誒計劃喺更新嗰個時候咧就加入一啲新功能，從而更便利視障人士及其他市民使用過路柱。

346
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:19,910
我哋啲委員同事有意誒表示發言嘅話咧，請你誒按鈕。噉我哋一間稍後都係因應時間嘅話，就先會畀四分鐘連問連答先。噉啊，我想請廖振新副局長。係誒，主席各位委員。

347
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:39,810
噉我哋喺呢度咧就誒，首先歡迎運輸及物流局嘅副局長廖振新先生，同埋運輸局嘅首席助理秘書長鄭思玲女士，以至咧就有其他嘅運輸處嘅代表啊，都一一參加。噉我唔詳細讀啦，因為都有個名單啦，大家可以。

348
01:12:44,880 --> 01:13:04,890
噉我想誒首先就請啊啊廖振新副局長誒同我哋簡介下文件，同埋咧我知道你哋會將會以電腦嘅投影片做進一步嘅誒簡介嘅噉。係噉啊，請啊廖振新副局長可以開始簡介啦。但係喺呢個時候咧，就如果係我哋。

349
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:50,180
政府一直致力妥善管理行人過路處設施及維持其有效運作，並留意相關嘅技術發展及檢視使用者嘅需要，在更新裝置時考慮加入適用嘅新功能，應對日益增加嘅交通及行人需求。

350
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:34,260
燈號狀態，令視障人士可以依照聲音嘅提示安全橫過馬路。現有嘅發聲裝置咧，喺二零零三年起開始安裝嘅，咁大部分嘅裝置咧已經連續使用咗超過二十年㗎啦，誒超過咗正常嘅使用年限，誒加上呢啲裝置嘅固

351
01:14:52,040 --> 01:15:12,050
至於斑馬線嘅黃波燈咧，運輸署亦亦已經喺部分嘅斑馬線進行咗試驗嘅計劃，採用咗優化設計嘅黃波燈。試驗結果顯示咧，新型嘅黃波燈咧對提醒嗰啲駕駛者喺斑馬線過路處停落嚟，讓行人過路嘅效果就好正面嘅。

352
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:49,550
誒接下嚟，我請運輸署嘅同事咧以投影片就為大家詳細介紹下呢兩項新嘅措施，然後我哋好樂意回答委員嘅問題。多謝主席。邊位係咪馮生？係好啊！主席各位議員，今日嘅簡介咧係會分為更新電子行人過路發聲裝置。

353
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:48,830
新功能方便咧。

354
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:45,670
電視傳講大概有一萬三千個嘅發聲裝置。

355
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:32,150
部分嘅路口嘅振動組件咧，係附設有行人過路按鍵。

356
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:19,970
跟住，我會大為大家介紹新裝置嘅外觀同埋新功能嘅。

357
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:37,470
畀行人咧喺有需要過馬路嘅時候咧，啟動行人嘅綠燈燈號嘅。

358
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:35,620
將來咧，有行人過路按鍵嘅振動組件嘅面板咧，係藍色嘅。

359
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,720
第二個新功能係裝喺裝置嘅右邊嘅摸讀地圖。

360
01:17:56,410 --> 01:18:02,440
發光組件嘅作用咧，係幫助視障人士更加容易去揾到過路處嘅位置嘅。

361
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:30,090
同而家嘅發聲裝置一樣啦，新裝置咧係有發聲組件同埋振動組件兩個部分嘅。

362
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:56,130
裝置嘅第一樣新功能咧，係裝喺裝置上方增設嘅發光組件。

363
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:43,640
而冇按鍵嘅咧係灰色嘅，外觀上咧係會比而家嘅裝置咧更加容易去分辨。

364
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:17,570
現時咧喺行人過路處嘅發聲裝置咧，主要有兩個組件嘅，即係發聲組件同埋振動組件。

365
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:03,890
隨住發聲裝置技術嘅發展咧，運輸署希望藉住今次更新嘅契機咧，引入設立使用者需要新功能。

366
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:27,190
而發聲組件同埋振動組件係會分別透過發出唔同嘅響號同埋振動模式咧，為視障人士提示行人燈號嘅狀態嘅。

367
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:55,300
啲裝置咧，大部分已經連續運作咧超過咗二十年，超過咗正常嘅使用年限，故障率咧亦都逐漸有上升嘅趨勢。

368
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:15,000
運輸署咧喺二零二一年至到二三年嘅期間咧，開展嘅更新發聲裝置嘅先導計劃裏邊咧，已經喺二十個路口測試過將會添加嘅新功能。

369
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:17,450
嗯。

370
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,680
係。

371
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,000
同時間咧，主要。

372
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,700
呢個就係示範嘅。

373
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,240
誒使用方法。

374
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,190
而係呢個功能嘅示範。

375
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,560
畀使用者咧知道身處嘅位置。

376
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,810
好，第四個新功能係非接觸式嘅行人過路按鍵。

377
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:34,180
第三個新功能係語音信息朗讀朗讀功能。

378
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:14,750
而家個發聲裝置咧，喺夜間咧已經設置咗比日間較低嘅音量。

379
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,470
第五個新功能，亦都係最後一個功能咧，係靈活聲音調節嘅功能。

380
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:30,270
彌敦道亞街老街，彌敦道亞街老街，Nathan Road, Argyle Street。

381
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:16,070
彌敦道亞街樓街，彌敦道亞街老街，Nathan Road, Argyle Street。

382
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:46,550
由於使用者係無需觸碰裝置咧，已經能夠啟動按鍵嘅啦。呢方面咧係可以減少佢哋喺衞生方面嘅顧慮嘅。

383
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:47,290
行人只需要按動振動組鍵下邊嘅語音訊息按鍵裝置咧，就會以粵語、普通話同埋英語去讀出過路處附近街道名稱。

384
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:26,720
唔好讀地圖係以觸覺嘅方式咧，將行人過路處嘅佈局資訊咧提供畀視障人士，例如前邊有幾多條行車線啦，有冇安全島啦，或者有冇電車輕鐵路軌等等。

385
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,370
去提醒司機。

386
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,630
新型嘅黃波燈。

387
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:51,590
喺斑馬線前面停車讓路。

388
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,610
我哋將傳統嘅黃波燈更換成為新型嘅黃波燈。

389
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:59,420
我哋預計喺二零二七年嘅年底咧，就會換曬所有嘅發聲裝置。

390
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,790
其後咧，裝置係會將音量咧自動回復翻原本嘅水平嘅。

391
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,640
跟住落嚟咧，我會交畀我同事何先生咧，繼續介紹簡介嘅下半部分。

392
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:48,240
運輸署咧已經喺就住呢個更換計劃咧，根據程序咧批出咗合約。

393
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:54,780
而且咧係會喺今年嘅第二季開始咧，逐步安裝同埋將新裝置咧投入運作。

394
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:11,790
可能請誒揸緊啲時間啦，因為我哋都預留多少時間畀啲委員去誒提問同埋表達意見。

395
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:19,050
唔該，唔該，主席。咁接住落嚟啦，我會介紹第二部分啦，就係更新公共道路上斑馬線嘅黃波燈。

396
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:37,640
噉我政府不時都接獲到市民嘅意見啦，指部分嘅司機啦就冇喺斑馬線前面停車啦，讓路畀行人，影響過路嘅安全。

397
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:29,510
斑馬線咧係香港常用嘅地面行人過路設施啦。咁現時全香港咧總共有二百三十個嘅斑馬線。

398
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:46,700
咁針對針對呢個問題啦，我哋處方亦都留意到啦。其實喺一啲地區啦，已經喺部分嘅斑馬線咧採用咗帶有優化設計嘅黃波燈。

399
01:21:53,660 --> 01:22:07,150
我哋喺二零二二年嘅四月份，分別喺葵青區、深水埗區、九龍城區同埋大埔區，總共五個嘅斑馬線過路柱進行進行咗一項維期六個月優化斑馬線設施嘅試驗計劃。

400
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:35,040
喺新嘅夜間減音模式之下咧，新裝置咧將可設置同埋發出比現時更低嘅音量。而視障人士咧係可以利用新增設嘅專用無線裝置或者手機應用程式嘅遙控功能，喺過馬路嘅時候咧短暫噉樣提供發聲裝置嘅音量。

401
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,170
我哋嘅簡報就完結，多謝各位。

402
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,600
左手邊係傳統黃波燈，而右手邊係新型嘅黃波燈。

403
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:31,870
由於試驗嘅效果理想啦，運輸署已經安排咗。

404
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:00,510
咁由於設置咗更多嘅發光組件啦，即使係喺日頭啦，其實都可以吸引到注視嘅。

405
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:54,300
我哋可以睇到啦，短片上啦，新型紅燈嘅設計咧，其實佢比舊嘅設計就更加顯眼同埋明亮嘅。

406
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:56,620
我哋同時亦都會配合宣傳教育同埋執法嘅行動，加強提醒駕駛者喺斑馬線前面停車讓路畀行人。

407
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:38,910
噉啊！我而家會播放個短片啦，讓委員可以誒瞭解到誒新型黃波燈嘅設計同埋傳統黃波燈嘅設計嘅分別。

408
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:40,450
機電工程署更換全香港公共道路上面嘅黃波燈，相關嘅更換工程咧已經喺二零二四年底開展咗。

409
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:49,310
我哋預計喺二零二五年三月份開始啦，就會喺斑馬線逐步安裝及投入運作。預計喺二零二七年全部就會安裝完成。

410
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:24,730
個新設計係比舊設計更加明亮顯眼，而大部分嘅受訪者亦都誒表示，更多嘅駕駛者係願意喺斑馬線前面停車讓路畀佢哋過馬路。

411
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:14,710
試驗計劃顯示啦，駕駛者喺斑馬線前面停車讓路畀行人嘅比例明顯上升啦。根據現場嘅意見調查啦，大部分嘅受訪行人咧，亦都表示誒。

412
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:29,950
相對於傳統嘅黃波燈嘅黑白相間之處同埋黃色球體，佢亦都附設咗帶有可以發動閃動黃光嘅光環，而之處部分亦都可以發出閃動嘅白光。學生，我建議你個接近個咪多少少，係啦，噉啊會收音清晰啲。唔該曬。

413
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:21,460
好啊，唔該曬。以後落嚟就係委員表達意見同埋提問嘅時間。噉啊，而家誒見到個名單上示意發言嘅就有，暫時有五位，分別就係陳佩良議員、劉業強議員、陳學鋒議員、嚴光議員同埋田北辰議員嘅噉。噉我。

414
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:41,470
一定嘅時間就連問連答四分鐘。第一位陳佩良議員，誒，多多謝主席。就誒，更換呢啲誒老舊嘅設施咧，其實都係誒對提升行人嘅安全係有一個好幫好幫誒好好嘅幫助嘅。誒噉，我有兩個簡單問題啫。第一就係嗰個誒。

415
01:24:41,470 --> 01:25:01,480
發聲裝置去更新咧，其實係好嘅，同埋增增加咗啲功能。但係咧，我啊反為又擔心咗咧，增加咗啲功能會唔會令嗰個發聲裝置複雜咗？咁譬如或者個操作上，頭先我哋睇到同樣一個咁細嘅裝置咧，其實多咗幾樣嘢㗎嘛，包包括喺下邊誒摸一摸佢有。

416
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:21,490
會誒讀出唔同嘅語言啦，噉樣咁同埋咧，嗰個仲有嘅靈活調節聲量。咁其實喺個操作上會唔會係有啲未必真係誒好達到理想咧？譬如如果靈活聲量操作咧，我諗緊，如果嗰個智障誒視障人士行到嗰度，未必好弱嘅，佢都未必聽到。

417
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:03,930
哦，係。

418
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,530
變為。

419
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:01,060
咁至於嗰個誒？

420
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:57,970
係比較複雜啲嘅，有冇一啲更更簡單啲嘅方法咧？咁嗰個遙控我都想知係咪每一個視障人士你都發一個畀佢啊？定係點樣樣嘅咧？到時候咁呢個係係一個啦，就操作嗰個方便性嗰度咧，點樣去誒考慮一下佢嚇噉樣。

421
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:41,510
咁跟住佢又要一係就攞個遙控，一係就係用手機程式去嚟將佢提升翻一段短時間。一來個個時間上，如果用手機程式，我唔知視障人士用用得到啦，係嘛？咁噉嘅係咪可行咧？呢一樣嘢同埋你調調節咗個音量，佢跟住又收翻細啊噉，個操作都。

422
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:21,420
黃波燈嗰度咧就誒，因為其實呢一個咧，我覺得咧啲斑馬線停唔停車咧，其實好視乎嗰啲駕駛者態度嘅，我又覺得嚇，呢一樣都好重要，所以我好同意咧，你哋話要加強嗰個宣傳配合，點樣令到嗰啲駕駛者咧係知道去到誒嗰個斑馬線嗰度要停停誒，要要停。

423
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:41,430
車讓行人過馬路噉，同埋我都仲想誒諗多一樣嘢，就係其實嗰個黃波燈嗰度咧，有冇機會可以裝啲攝錄裝置咧？即係話，你如果你有個攝錄裝置喺度咧，個駕駛者係會更警惕啦。即係為你衝一衝，或者係當有人行過係嘅時候，究竟邊個讓邊個咧？啲爭執都少啦。我。

424
01:26:41,430 --> 01:27:01,440
我有個裝置喺度㗎，佢真係衝咗過去，噉我影低咗佢，咪第日咪告你咯，係嘛？即係呢個有冇可能咧？咁長遠嚟計嚇，唔該。嗯，好啊，兩組問題，阿副局。好啊，嗱，我我嘗試答第二條問題啦。啊，咁第一條問題咧，其實就我會請運輸署嘅同事答。好。不過咧，誒，據我瞭解咧，就誒運輸署嘅同事咧，同嗰啲盲人。

425
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:21,450
團體咧都有好深入溝通，就即係誒同佢哋傾呢啲新裝置點樣用嘅。咁第二條問題咧，其實都關乎我哋係咪用多啲誒攝錄裝置去誒管理交通嘅問題，即係唔止係黃波燈呢個問題嚇。咁誒嗱嗰度咧都有好多考慮嘅。咁誒以往咧最最敏感嘅考慮。

426
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:41,460
就係個私隱嘅問題啦嚇咁誒，而家嚟講咧，我哋暫時未有一個好誒，即係好好好好好確定嘅計劃去利用呢啲C.T.V咧嚟嚟做多啲嘅誒交通管理。當然，我哋而家喺誒現有嘅計劃有嘅，即係喺喺喺啲關鍵嘅道路咧，就睇。

427
01:27:41,460 --> 01:28:01,470
住一般個交通流量誒，但係就唔會牽涉話誒誒影到嗰個車嗰啲詳細嘅資料啊，或者嗰啲人嘅資料嘅啊。咁所以咧就係話純粹，如果黃波燈嚟嚟誒加埋呢啲噉嘅攝錄裝置咧，誒，我哋而家冇呢個計劃嘅嚇。誒，我請運輸處打答第一條。噉啊，馮馮。

428
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:24,220
誒誒，歐生誒，多謝署長，多謝議員嘅提問。噉我講關於個呢個我哋嗰個電子發聲裝置嗰個情況啦。咁因為電子發聲裝置咧，嗰個使用主要嘅對象咧就係啲視障嘅人士嘅，所以我哋係好關心佢哋作為個用家咧。

429
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:44,230
對於我哋新一代嘅電子發聲裝置，佢嗰個接受程度啊，會唔會用得慣？我哋都好緊張嘅，所以喺二一年至到二三年呢幾年兩年幾時間咧，我哋特登咧就同佢哋嗰啲組織咧就係一齊咧就做咗個試驗嘅計劃，就喺全港。

430
01:28:44,230 --> 01:29:04,240
講二十個位置咧，就首先咧就安裝咗一個我哋叫新一代嘅電子發聲裝置嘅prototype啦嚇試用版噉樣樣。咁喺呢個過程咧，我哋就同佢做咗好多呢個即係聯絡功夫啦，睇下佢哋用家會唔會容易學得到、接受得到新嘅裝置裏邊啲功能同埋呢？公

431
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:24,250
功能對佢哋係咪有用嘅？咁所以即係而家我哋將會喺全港都會做呢啲裝置咧功能咧，佢哋大即係佢哋都會明白，同埋佢哋已經知道點樣用。咁去到正話有個位咧，就係我哋有一個遙控功能啊嘛。咁呢個遙控功能其實都係我哋同佢哋即係磋商翻嚟一啲。

432
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:44,260
新增嘅功能嚟嘅，噉佢哋本身就係希望即係能夠透過個裝置。如果喺夜晚比較上靜個裝置發聲嘅聲量都較少嘅時間咧，可以幫佢過馬路咧，就暫時提升嗰個裝置嗰個音量。咁呢個操作咧，佢哋其實都要。

433
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,580
影響呢個誒推行咧？

434
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:59,510
都會將佢更換成我哋最新一代嘅，咁包括新界、香港、九龍噉樣樣去換發嚇。

435
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:30,570
誒變行易行嘅社區環境，噉我表示支持嘅。咁同時咧，我有以後有啲問題想跟進，就希望政府可以回應。

436
01:30:55,340 --> 01:31:03,030
提供一個相同功能咧，就可以用得翻嘅啦。嗯，好，下一位劉業強議員，誒係主席。

437
01:31:50,860 --> 01:32:00,580
誒都好多長長者啦，我覺得誒都係有需要，可唔可以諗下下一步係咪喺鄉郊可以係誒施行呢啲嘢咧？咁誒。

438
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:11,850
誒有冇計劃？咁如果有計劃，誒係點樣去加強宣傳同埋誒去等等到係即係嗰邊嘅居民可以係比較瞭解點樣用唔該。

439
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:35,650
誒主席，好呢個啊呢個撥款咧，其實我哋已經係攞攞即係已經獲得咗批准嘅。咁呢個兩個撥款咧，佢佢佢唔係一般工程嘅撥款嚟嘅，佢因為其實就係一個更換設備嘅性質。

440
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:58,960
已經掌握到㗎啦，噉我哋都會派發一個誒叫做遙控裝置，咁同一時間我亦都會喺我哋運輸處嗰個應用程式出行語裏邊咧，就加裝呢個噉嘅功能嘅，咁呢個裝置。

441
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:34,820
就等佢哋可以揸住個遙控器咧，就喺嗰個即係路面上邊使用噉樣樣嘅。好，啊，巡捕人員有冇跟進？哦，都係嗰個遙控器咧。如果第日壞咗啊，維修啊，係咪繼續都係由即係運輸署嗰個供應畀佢哋㗎？

442
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:19,270
因為佢哋誒，我所知啦，即係香港市況，如果係全盲嘅人士咧，香港有萬幾個㗎。咁有超過一半咧，其實佢哋咧係超過六十歲嘅，所以佢哋可能對應用程式嗰個掌握咧就未必咁高。所以我哋政府亦都安排咗咧，係第一次一次性咁派發畀佢哋。

443
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:55,340
噉嘅，我哋同誒相關嘅視障人士團體都溝通好㗎啦。咁第一個我哋畀佢咧就係免費派發嘅。咁當將來譬如真係丟失咗啊，或者係壞咗咧，佢哋可以選擇同個供應商咧就去再買翻一個，又或者咧就用我哋免費嘅出行易嘅應用程式就。

444
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:23,320
咁近年推出係多項嘅誒變類行人過路同埋呢個計劃啦，同埋措施啦。咁今次係使用多年嘅俗稱黃盒嘅電子行人過路嘅發聲裝置，咁同埋呢個係斑馬線黃波燈進行嘅大規模更更換啦。咁都係可以改善市民出行嘅體驗，咁打造誒。

445
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:50,860
噉啊，關於喺誒新界鄉郊嘅咁近年係展開咗呢個計劃啦，先嘅計劃就深水埗南區由由尖旺二十個路口就安裝呢啲誒新嘅電子過路發聲裝置。咁頭先都介紹得好清楚。咁但係就未有喺新界同埋鄉郊地區試用。噉你大家知道誒鄉郊地區。

446
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:33,000
好啊！啊，副局長啊！啊，我啊啊，主席，我請運輸署嘅同事誒誒講講呢個問題啦嚇。係咪歐處長啊？係你好，好啊！主席啊，劉議員誒，我哋之前喺二一至二三年做嗰個試用計劃咧，所揀嘅地方咧誒，主要係一啲視障人士。

447
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:53,070
比較上活動多啲嘅地方，或者係佢哋嗰啲機構或者工場集中嘅地方，咁方便佢哋去試用嘅。咁亦都即係個試驗成功啦。噉我哋而家去到下一步咧，就係會全港性將所有路口，即係如果係有呢啲即係我哋叫黃盒嘅地方咧。

448
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:20,000
啊！阿劉議員有冇跟進？我想問下，咁如果你即係呢個計劃係咪財爺都係即係好積極，係會撥錢咧？因為你都花費九千八百幾萬，係緩慢三個呢啲發聲裝置。噉啊，而家係成日都話財赤啦，政府都話都係財爺都話會係慳錢啦。咁呢個係咪誒唔會影？

449
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:11,580
你哋有冇統計損壞率係幾多咧？誒，其實如果唔換，

450
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:04,390
好咧，我諗你哋再研究下，因為非接觸式，我自己覺得就好一般嘅啫嚇。誒，最後一個咧就係嗰個。

451
01:33:55,950 --> 01:34:05,860
其實已經係有咗呢個撥款㗎啦。不過咧，我哋推行嗰陣時候咧，因為都要誒都要嗰啲時間啦，所以就分幾年噉樣推行啊。剛才亦都講過時間表啊。

452
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:51,910
誒主席，誒副局，係咪請阿歐生、夏陳議員四個問題？咁誒第一個問題我嘗試答啊，以第二三四個問題咧都比較技術性啲，我就請運輸處嘅同事答。

453
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:23,190
等到頭先我講嘅總體規劃能唔能夠捱得到一次過去總整體去去提升咧，而唔需要夾硬再喺度誒申請呢次嘅撥款咧。

454
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:35,170
誒，仲有就係而家新嘅呢種嘅裝置，你哋估計嘅年限係用到幾耐咧？會唔會又係二十年或者更加長嘅時間去去做咧？

455
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:40,440
燈號出嚟嘅，誒過馬路紅色佢就成條斑馬線紅色嘅，誒綠色佢就綠色嘅，咁讓駕駛者、讓行人都會更加清晰。呢一類嘅諗法，你哋會唔會去思考咧？而唔係淨係純粹做波燈咧？嚇！

456
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:51,410
嘅部門咧，大家一齊傾一傾，喺邊度咧係需要裝多啲智慧燈柱。不過咧，喺據我知咧，喺啲新發展區咧，其實嗰個誒就即係預留方面咧，會做得比較好啲嘅。喺舊區裝翻咧，個困難就大啲。噉啊，我我或者請翻誒運輸嘅同事講翻另外嘅三條問題啊。

457
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:55,950
咁所以咧就誒，即係佢係符合政府一般收入帳嘅非經營帳目嘅分目誒，即係一個六零三嘅關於機械啊、設備嗰啲嗰啲類別嘅。而呢類嘅類別咧，我哋通常咧就係透過嗰個誒誒誒嗰個撥款條例草案咧，就向立法會攞錢嘅。咁所以咧嗱就。

458
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:26,610
好，好，好跟進㗎。好，唔該，下一位請陳學鋒議員。誒，多，多謝主席。誒，我哋誒其實近年咧都做咗好多誒關電燈柱誒嘅工程嘅，喺啲各方面嘅信號啊，誒甚至乎掛嗰個紅色燈啊噉樣。而家做。

459
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:46,620
同埋呢個即係優化誒，我唔知部門有冇考慮過咧？真係整體去審視我哋嘅電燈柱，做一個即係更加誒高層次嘅升級，唔好好似掛聖誕樹噉啊！得閒諗起又掛一樣嘢，得閒諗咩又掛一樣嘢。我哋而家啲啲燈柱咧，好似真係誒得閒。

460
01:34:46,620 --> 01:35:06,630
掛紅燈得閒啊，掛個啷啷噉樣。而家誒有冇依個噉嘅總體考慮誒？作為一個智能燈柱總體去規劃咧，呢個你哋有冇噉嘅思考模式咧？如果有嘅話，其實係唔可以一一拼去處理咧。第一個，第二咧就誒，而家就現有嗰啲發聲裝置就話用咗二十年啦，開始有個損壞。

461
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:55,460
仲有一個就係誒，我我有個建議嘅就誒非接觸式咧。我喺立法會部lift咧，我都相當或者喺而家好多升降機咧，都會好有感受嘅非接觸式咧。好多時唔係想high佢，佢都會high到佢嘅。咁其實會唔會增加咗個損壞率咧？誒係咪真係？

462
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:25,190
你而家做波燈啦，即係斑馬線個波燈啦。誒，波燈嗰個效果明顯嘅，睇到嗰個片係明顯嘅。但係我見咧，其實內地咧好多喺個地面嗰度咧藏咗落去地底，譬如話上海，其實斑馬線嗰度咧就將啲燈咧藏咗喺地底。其實佢更加明顯去反映到嗰個即係誒所個燈。

463
01:36:52,190 --> 01:37:12,200
咁第一個問題咧，其實就係關乎係咪搞一個所謂智慧燈柱啦。其實我哋有喺啲唔同嘅區咧，都嘗試過誒誒搞智慧燈柱，不過就唔係誒純粹係我哋交通嗰個嗰個需求嘅誒，都有好多其他嘅嘅要求，譬如係環保柱啊，即係誒誒睇埋啲誒。

464
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:32,210
路邊嘅空氣質素啊之類，咁誒嗱嗰度咧，主要就係誒誒創新科技誒嗰邊局負責誒整體統籌誒。當然啦，我哋運輸方面咧都會有啲誒有啲方便嘅，有啲使用嘅啊。咁呢方面咧就誒要誒幾個跨局嘅嘅。

465
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:04,410
啊！

466
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:12,810
呢一次咧，我問你個問題咧，你係預想不到嘅。

467
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,980
部長，琴日喺大會咧，同你激辯咗六個鐘頭。

468
01:41:51,820 --> 01:42:03,120
多謝主席。好，下一位嚴光議員。誒，田北辰議員咧有家事咧，畀佢講先啦，好嘛？啊，好啊。噉啊，田北辰議員先。誒，有兩個調咗嘅好。

469
01:37:51,700 --> 01:38:11,710
啊，朱立。啊，歐生，其實就仲有四個問題嘅，一個就損壞率，一個就連限，另外一個就非接觸式嘅個設施嗰個誒效果，第另外一個就係波登地面嘅，即係內地使用地面嗰種嘅顯示咁等，呢四個問題。好，我首先講講就係嗰個電子。

470
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:31,720
發聲裝置嘅損壞率先啦，咁數字上咧就一五年嗰陣時咧，當佢哋都仲係喺壯年嗰陣時咧，就我哋收到嗰個故障報告咧，就一年有一百三十組嚇噉樣樣嘅情況。即係個率係幾多啊？一百單即係一百三十個呢啲黃盒咧，就出現故障總。

471
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:51,730
數咧總數幾多？我哋一萬三千個。一萬三。係啦，冇錯。咁去到一七年咧，噉就開始個數就攀升，因為已經過咗嗰個保用期啦，即係嗰嗰個使用壽命啊。噉就我哋嗰年就錄得咧就有成一千一百組嘅燈咧，就即係呢啲黃誒呢個電子發聲裝置咧出現故障啦，即係唔同。

472
01:38:51,730 --> 01:39:11,740
形式噉樣啦，就高幾倍嘅，咁所以就喺嗰年咧，我哋就覺得有需要準備去更換，所以係嗰陣時咧就同即係嗰個唔同嘅時尚組織咧，就去研究下一代嗰個裝置點樣樣啦。咁另外就關於個交通燈柱嗰個情況，即係我哋而家就有。

473
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:31,750
有啲唔同嘅即係設施放上去啦，即係可能係而家電子發聲裝置啦，亦都有可能我哋可以投射啲紅光落去地面，即係提醒啲行人有關個紅公仔啦。噉我哋個設計正正咧就係希望做到個模組化，即係一個燈柱嘅設計咧，佢可以適應唔同路口嚇，即係可以有啲唔。

474
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:51,760
唔同功能就唔需要咧，就每個路口咧就用啲唔同嘅燈，即係交通燈柱咁啦。咁有啲燈有啲地方可能需要，即係譬如又係黑點啦嚇，有啲車撞人機嘅意外多咧，我哋就會裝埋呢個紅色嘅投射嘅裝置噉樣樣啦。咁即係如果係完全冇過路。

475
01:39:51,760 --> 01:40:11,770
設施嘅監控燈口咧，我哋就唔會裝呢個我哋叫黃色箱仔，即係電子發聲裝置噉樣嘅。咁呢個就係容讓到即係一個標準設計咧，有最大嘅用途啦，減輕將來要更換嗰個需要啦。咁關於嗰個誒非接觸式嗰個問題啦，噉我哋其實二一至到二三。

476
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:31,780
三年咧就首先就試用呢個非接觸式嘅噉就去到而家咧，我哋見到佢嗰個功效都仲係即係冇乜點壞，同埋咧誒驚啲人會唔會好容易經過就點得到咧？其實我哋嗰個黃色箱嗰個接非接觸式咧係可以做調教嘅，喺唔同。

477
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:51,790
同可以調教到咧，係喺唔同距離咧都可以叫做誒啟動嗰個誒接觸嗰個嗰個綠色嗰個誒燈號嘅。噉我哋而家嘅調教咧就發去到一個位置咧就啱啱好，啲人真係有心去想過咧，就放隻手埋去唔使掂到就得，但係都唔會容易咧就。

478
01:40:51,790 --> 01:41:11,800
讀錯咗啲人喺隔離企喺樹度，當佢想過馬路噉樣樣啦。咁至於仲有一個問題咧，就關於我哋係咪可以有啲城城市咁咧，就將呢啲誒黃黃波燈嗰個情況就放喺地底噉樣樣嘅。噉我哋都有好多唔同考慮啦。咁其中個考慮就係即係譬如。

479
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:31,810
駕駛嘅角度，車跟住車嘅話咧，如果放喺地面咧，佢有機會畀前邊啲車有可能撞，即係阻住嘅。但係我哋如果用黃波燈個傳統嘅情況咧，咁車後邊車都有機會容易見到嗰個斑馬線嘅存在啦。咁另外香港個環境都係一個獨特嘅，即係車就多。

480
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:51,820
路就少，咁嗰個損耗咧就比較上大嘅。如果裝咗喺地底嘅話咧，我哋將將來嗰個維修咧，嗰個頻密度會高，咁亦都可能會影響到個交通。噉我哋好多個考慮之下咧，我哋都可能同而家其他嘅城市一樣咧，主要都用翻喺黃波燈作為一個警示嘅作用啦。

481
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:51,740
其實。

482
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,310
誒RF一樣啦。

483
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:14,820
咁當時政府咧就係用藍牙去做。

484
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:22,070
噉我其實對呢啲嘢都唔係好熟，因為。

485
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:54,970
即係話咧，佢待住呢個機，佢去到某個情況咧。

486
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:18,060
誒主席，運輸署二三年咧就首次安裝呢類嘢啦。

487
01:43:55,250 --> 01:44:00,300
睇附近嘅路聲咧，佢會大聲啲；夜晚咧又會細聲啲，噉啊皆大歡喜。

488
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:18,310
面積大過香港二十倍，都係得八千個。我哋一個城市有一萬三千個。

489
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:10,980
如果你fix死一個聲音咧，一時就冇人聽到，一時就嘈過頭。咁當時佢又整咗個啲噉嘅控制。

490
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:24,860
噉啊！我哋去落去睇過阿成咧，就唔知點解咧，就唔係好做到。噉佢哋啊要求嗰個叫咩啊？RF啊，radio誒frequency去做。

491
01:42:52,400 --> 01:43:02,250
要佢聽到咧，就係要嗰個當時嘅過馬路嘅聲，同埋嗰個嗰個系統嘅聲咧，有一個相當距離。

492
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:47,710
係，亦都係多謝再你啦。透過我多謝你啦。原來你哋可以揾藍牙啲供應商咧，搞到而家咧，佢個功能咧係同呢個。

493
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:11,270
嗱，而家咧全世界都有唔少地方裝呢啲，不過我有啲嘢詫異喎，就我查過，原來丹麥係全世界最多嘅，應該，誒。

494
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:36,800
咁政府就某啲原因就好想繼續去做用日南系統，噉啊搞搞搞咗一啲，我今日好開心，點解佢哋走嚟多謝我？

495
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:50,320
佢如果嗰個過路燈太大聲咧，附近啲人會嘈得好犀利。尤其是夜晚太細聲，啲人聽唔到，所以成日都有呢個問題。跟住走嚟揾我，就係話。

496
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:38,040
即係你即係冇乜接觸個羣體，噉啊二一年咧，誒有啲智障組織代表嚟揾我幫手同政府溝通，咁政府之前介紹嗰度都有張圖，即係我哋坐啲開會，其中個問題好簡單，個智障人士。

497
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,430
香港係全世界。

498
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:40,970
對視障人士嚟講，最無障礙嘅一個城市。

499
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:21,970
佢哋知道嗰個係一個叫做斑馬線，就可以讓行人去過馬路噉樣咯。

500
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:25,070
嗱，噉我呢度就一定要讚下你，即係你個天物對於呢件事啊，即係畀盡心機。

501
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:34,150
噉我啊問題係咩咧？捉到鹿要識脱角啊！可唔可以同羅素佩傾下？喺旅遊方面大力推廣。

502
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:16,720
亦都非常好，噉我我諗我哋翻去同誒誒旅遊嗰邊誒傾一傾啦嚇，即係睇下呢個係咪一個誒推銷點啊嚇。好，好啊，田院有冇跟進？冇啦，冇啦。好，下一位，阻止多謝。好，我個下一位嚴光議員。

503
01:44:41,250 --> 01:45:01,260
嗱，我諗呢樣嘢係一個賣點嚟嘅。我終於有樣嘢咧，我覺得我哋係全世界第一嘅。主席，好，我只不過幾個建議你啫。啊，副局呢個建議，你點有咩回應？啊，主席啊，好多謝啊啊田議員嘅讚賞啊，誒非常寶貴呢個讚賞啊。咁另外咧就話誒嗰個建議。

504
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:37,010
誒多謝主席。咁咧，我提嘅問題咧，關於黃波燈嘅。咁咧，舊版黃波燈嘅條件之下咧，誒，各方有冇誒統計過咁咧？係由於黃波燈咧唔夠顯眼而誒產生嘅個交通事故咧，係未屬於多發嘅。誒咁咧，舊年咧誒呢方面嘅。

505
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:57,020
誒誒車撞人嘅誒，由於黃燈嗰個唔夠閃眼，產生嘅誒車撞人嘅個事故咧有幾單嘅。咁呢個有冇呢個數字？咁咧係財政咧，依家而咁嚴重嘅情之下咧，誒是否都可以咧？誒就係話，如果係唔係多發嘅，是否可以咧係有損壞？

506
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:17,030
之下咧，誒更換更換一個，唔係一個全面鋪開嘅。咁咧，即係話咧去拉長嗰個誒，你依家預計係二零二七年完啊嘛。如果可以咧係誒為咗一個咁咧誒換一個咁咧，可能咧係拉多到二零二九啊、二零三零年咧。咁咧，如果噉樣話咧誒，可以可以慳可以慳啲慳啲。

507
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:37,040
啦噉啊！依家嘅情形之下，咁咧呢個係一個建議啦。唔該。好啊，呢個係個建議。噉啊，副局係主席。誒，第一個問題，我請誒關於嗰啲誒數字咧，我請運輸署嘅同事講講。咁但係講誒財赤慳嗰個問題咧，即係誒正正咧，就係因為我哋而家想大規模更換咧，先係可以。

508
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:57,050
將嗰個每個更換嘅錢咧就可以平啲。如果逐個更換咧，嗰個錢咧就會誒貴好多嘅。咁呢樣我都請啊，即係嗰個誒每個每個每個逐個增更換同埋我哋而家一批更換嗰個分別咧，都請運輸處嘅同事畀一畀啲數字啊。好啊，噉啊，在李處長啊，歐生。好啊。

509
01:46:57,050 --> 01:47:17,060
冇問題嘅，誒主席啊，議員噉就關於個意外數字啦。咁香港而家有大概二百三十個斑馬線過路處嘅，咁喺過去五年啦，平均每一年喺交通斑斑馬線位置出現嘅意外，大概每年四十宗噉樣嘅嚇。

510
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:37,070
咁誒，我哋喺早兩年、二年咧，就喺香港五個位置咧，就裝設咗新嘅誒呢個交通，即係誒斑馬線嘅黃波燈嚇。咁喺裝呢個裝置之前，喺五個位置咧，噉我哋睇得到個數據咧，就有。

511
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:57,080
五單嗰嗰幾年有五單交通意外，咗兩年幾嚇，噉就有兩個死亡個案啦，噉就一個嚴重受傷啦，咁剩翻嗰兩個咧就係輕微受傷嘅。咁裝咗呢個改善咗嘅即係新嘅黃波燈之後咧，誒嗰個情況咧就係呢五個位置咧過去。

512
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:17,090
嗰三年幾咧，就有三單輕微嘅交通意外嘅啫。噉我哋見得到個成效都唔錯嘅，所以我哋都覺得呢個係值得向即係香港其實為數唔多嘅二百三十個嘅位置咧，都換埋嗰個新型嘅黃波燈。咁駕駛者亦都容易啲見得到得一種新嘅黃波燈。

513
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,700
慳翻啲時間，呢個就係正正係做嗰樣嘢。

514
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:48,790
即係我諗，我哋好多嘅，好似人人暢道通行啊！我哋過去起咗咁多嘅電梯。

515
01:51:46,990 --> 01:52:01,290
盡佢咧，喺今次呢個更新咧，正如足剛才介紹咧，誒邊啲要近邊啲唔近咧，我哋都有個明顯嘅分別，就顏色嗰個分別，即係正喺喺投影片嗰度都介紹咗。希望噉樣咧就會令啲人就更加容容易明白啦嚇。

516
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:23,660
去保障呢個行人過路安全，去提升呢啲設施，即係亦都有一定嘅年期啦。咁當然我絕對係會支持你哋去做一個逐步嘅更新。誒，我有一個少少問題啫，就係關於嗰個非足式嗰個問題。

517
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:42,620
好，阿嚴議員有冇跟進？冇，冇跟進。好，下一位請姚柏良副主席。誒，多謝主席。主席頭頭先阿田北辰議員所講嘅，即係我哋香港喺嗰個無障礙城市嗰方面嘅發展咧，即係呢個係絕對係我哋香港個賣點嚟嘅。我其實之前喺其他一啲會上面都有講過。

518
01:48:49,070 --> 01:49:09,080
誒喺嗰啲嘅隧道同埋一啲嘅誒上上山嘅一啲嘅嘅地區咧，係直跟增加咗好多啲無障礙設施。咁喺我哋過過馬路呢方面嚟講咧，其實對於聽障視障呢方面嘅照顧，亦都係即係做得相當之好嘅。我覺得噉，所以對於呢個工程咧，即係我我自己其實做誒。

519
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:43,950
嗱誒，我發覺咧，其實都唔單止我嘅，其實我都見到好多遊客咧，有時都分分唔清，即係啊，原嚟喺度等緊個燈，一路等佢轉綠燈，好乖喺度等，等等等等等等，極都唔轉綠燈嘅咧。噉啊，佢哋唔為意係要要先拍一拍個掣，你要求一個個即係轉燈嘅。

520
01:49:43,950 --> 01:50:03,960
過路嘅即係要要求一個轉綠燈嘅一個噉嘅指示，噉佢先會轉嘅。如果唔係嘅話咧，可能好耐都唔會轉嘅。咁嗱，我自己都有同樣嘅嘅經歷嘅，即係有時真係唔為意嘅。噉你轉咗呢個新嘅呢個呢個系統之後咧，其實嗰個標示能唔能夠更加清晰啲？嚇，呢個我都係一個要注意啦，即係。

521
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:23,970
呢個能能能唔能夠做到呢樣嘢咧？另外一個咧就係如果諗緊，其實而家非足式，即係你始終都係要靠近去，即係即係唔掂都好啦，都要靠近去養一養手噉。可唔可以做到就係話直情一個感應嗱？其實你個感應嗰個，就算嘅錯誤率都好啦，其實都唔影響啲咩太大問題嘅，因為你嗰個。

522
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:43,980
係，只不過嗰個對於嗰個綠燈嗰方面，可能嗰個誒同平時嘅誒嗰個轉燈嘅嗰個時間，同埋誒撳咗之後個轉燈嘅時間係嗰有少少嘅差別啫，都唔係一個好大嘅差別嘅。咁而家你又組又裝咗一啲嘅，即係誒有個投射個紅紅色嘅範圍噉，會唔會？

523
01:50:43,980 --> 01:51:03,990
個人一去到紅色範圍，就自動已經感染到咧。嗱，即係呢啲，我諗如果做到嘅話咧，係會更加便利，同埋咁多樣設措施咧，係更加有個成效啦。啊，多謝主席。好，副局。啊，主席。誒，第二個問題關於感染嗰個咧，就其實就係正正就係我個我哋誒之前話要推行嗰個實時監。

524
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:24,000
交通燈調節系統誒要做嘅嘢啊，咁嗰個咧就誒舊年都攞咗錢啦，我哋已經選定咗五十個誒路口，即係誒誒對呢方面有幫助嘅。咁嗰度亦都係會誒感應埋行人方面，即係如果你冇行人嘅誒，就唔好畀啲綠燈啲行人行啦噉樣嚇。即係喺嗰度。

525
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:46,990
誒，只要話誒，即係誒，有啲要撳，有啲唔使撳咧。啲純粹都係因為嗰個誒，即係嗰個誒，我哋想，如果佢入行人唔係好多嘅，我哋咪盡量想多啲綠綠燈嘅時間畀啲車咯。噉啊，有行人嗰陣時撳佢先會轉綠燈。誒，噉就變咗嗰個車流方面咧，就可以誒誒用。

526
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:22,360
阿主席，我就想講話，即係呢方面個顏色嘅分別點樣令到大家知道好清晰入到腦，甚至遊客都知道，就唔會話面面喺度即係呆等咯嚇。係明白嘅，明白呢呢樣嘢就係誒，即係要做多啲宣傳教育嗰個問題啦嚇。好唔該。好噉，另外係咪阿歐生有補充？誒，可以嘅噉。

527
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:42,370
噉就關於非足式同埋呢個即係我有撳手啦，你叫做需要行人去按鍵或者係一啲冇撳手。噉我一正話阿副局都講啦，噉我哋香港有兩款嘅。咁如果係誒有啲路口咧，係本身佢嗰個行人過路嘅安排咧，係喺啲行車嘅中。

528
01:52:42,370 --> 01:53:02,380
間我哋安排畀佢咧，咁嗰啲其實就係唔需要用行人去著嗰個叫做過路嗰個信號嘅，咁嗰個嗰種我哋而家新嘅嘅黃箱咧，我哋本身咧就會用一隻灰色嘅情況，同埋喺上邊有啲好清楚嘅顯示咧，就係話畀啲行人知唔使撳嘅。總之嗰個綠公仔咧就會去到嗰個時候咧就會。

529
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:50,150
係需要讓行人係優先嘅。

530
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,410
有啲司機咧個駕駛態度咧。

531
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,230
好，啊，陸議員有冇跟進？

532
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:07,750
係黃燈設計，噉啊會逐步推廣啦。

533
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:04,290
噉，但係佢今次咧又提出咧有一個新嘅喺斑馬線嘅。

534
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:13,720
噉啊，係一件好事嚟嘅。咁但係咧，我都留意到咧，其實而家喺斑馬線上面咧。

535
01:55:53,510 --> 01:56:01,060
我希望呢個要加強一啲嘅宣傳咧，即係藉住呢一次咧，即係換黃波仔呢個咁誒。

536
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:27,630
係啊，就唔係幾好嘅，即係都唔係好讓啲行人嘅，嚇，即係好問都會誒照過，甚至乎我見有人仲要加速添噉樣。

537
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:59,750
未開咪？係係我開咪先。誒，我曾經都有諗過咧。其實斑馬線係咪政府都一個係作為一種誒，逐漸係唔採用嘅一種過路設施咧？即係其實都少嘅，而係喺新區。

538
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:22,390
畀到個行人用㗎啦。咁有啲情況咧，譬如有啲可能建喺一條好長嘅路中間，零零丁丁有一個行人過路柱嗰只咧。咁嗰個咧就係因為如果行人唔係多咧，噉我哋咧就會安排一個要去觸碰或者要去搖去即係摸一摸。咁等嗰個誒。

539
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:42,400
交通燈知道有行人想過馬路，咁嗰個撳咗之後咧，嗰個燈號就盡快安排嗰個綠色人像畀個人過馬路。咁如果冇人需要嗰陣時咧，就會將嗰啲剩餘時間就畀車行，噉啊等啲車咧就冇咁容易塞，流通好啲噉樣咯。好，唔該曬，下一位陸俊雄議員。

540
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:47,940
噉我想問咧，過去呢段時間咧有冇做相關嘅執法，同埋咧安裝咗呢種新型嘅黃燈之後咧，會唔會就住斑馬線，即係司機應有嘅駕駛態度，會做翻一輪嘅公眾教育同宣傳咧？唔該，主席。嗯，好啊。啊，副局。啊，主席。誒，我請運輸署嘅同。

541
01:54:47,940 --> 01:55:07,950
同事講講下啲數字啊，同埋啲細節啦。噉，哇，係咪再嚟？處長啊，歐生，係係你好啊，主席啊，陸議員。噉我哋睇到警察咧，其實喺即係捉呢啲喺斑馬線裏邊即係違規操作嘅司機咧，其實佢都一路有即係叫做努力嘅。噉我哋有最近。

542
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:27,960
五年嘅數字啦，嚇咁二零二零年開始咧，佢係有四百三十七宗嘅；二零二一年咧就五百六十八宗，嚇；二零二二年咧就七百八十宗；二零二三年咧就七百三十七宗。咁去到最近即係二零二四年咧，就去到八百一十一宗嘅。噉我見到佢嗰個誒檢控數。

543
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:47,970
字咧，其實執法數字咧係一路上升緊嘅。咁當然執法係一環，即係好似有陸議員咁講，我哋絕對認同咧，教育咧係好緊要，宣傳好緊要嘅。即係所以我哋喺唔同嘅即係渠道咧，一路都向緊公眾，即係尤其是係架勢者宣，即係講呢個個信息咧，就係喺斑馬線咧。

544
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:21,350
標誌性嘅一個設計啦嚇，因為其實我哋望住黃波仔咧，由細望到大咧，其實你一個改設計咧都都幾震撼㗎，我覺得都噉啊仲識發光㗎添，即係即係而家都識發光，即係再有個圈噉樣啊，有個光環噉樣嘅設計，咁希望咧真係做一輪嘅宣傳教育啦。噉我亦都係歡迎咧見到個數。

545
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:01,070
噉啊，接下嚟就誒，我提問時間。

546
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:26,030
誒，我相信我哋區嘅同事咧會好專業噉樣去睇翻嗰個當地嗰個環境，而去誒設置翻誒相應嘅行人過路設施嘅。

547
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:57,250
嘅即係較為安全嘅過路嘅環境，畀嗰個即係附近街坊。咁所以我都期望誒誒部門啦，或者地區同事可以再審視翻個別嘅個案，係啦。唔該，主席。好啊。

548
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:37,640
地方我哋先會用個斑馬線同埋加個斑馬線。至於剛才你提嗰個誒個案咧，我諗我哋即係會後咧再翻去了解下，就誒誒再同阿阿梁議員商討下啦嚇。咁個標準我請運輸署嘅同事講講。好，誒邊位提問？

549
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:41,360
咧，其實警方咧係有努力去執法嘅，但係關鍵咧都係個宣傳。唔該，主席。好啊，好啊，誒主席啊，聽到陸議員呢個意見啊，即係好，我哋翻去翻去睇下點樣誒推誒推行啊。好啦，好聽到意見啊。下一位請梁文港議員。係多謝主席。誒，亦都係支持，即係包括係更新呢一個。

550
01:56:41,360 --> 01:57:01,370
個即係電子發射裝置啦，同埋會更新即係而家誒過路處嘅誒黃波燈，跟住呢兩個都係支持嘅，因為誒始終去改善嗰個誒即係過路嘅設施，然之後方便到唔同有需要嘅市民誒，能夠更加方便咁過到馬路。另外，亦都可以誒包括行人啦，同埋駕駛者都可以更加安全噉。

551
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:21,380
噉樣去通過相關嘅誒路口咧，咁呢個我哋即係都責無旁貸啦，一定支持政府去做。不過就住嗰個黃波燈嘅嗰個誒，即係安排上邊咧，其實誒我都想了解下嗱。當然誒，而家現有嘅或者需要更新嘅，咁頭先我哋提到一定支持。咁但係喺選擇一啲地區或者路口要再額外加。

552
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:41,390
呢啲黃波燈嘅時候，其實個標準而家現時係點樣咧？原因係因為喺地區上，其實我哋過去都收到啲個案，係可能有啲路口誒，可能都誒，因為個車流量嘅情況，或者係誒個別嘅設施，可能佢特別多一啲誒，包括誒小朋友啊，或者長者會經過咁誒，亦都。

553
01:57:41,390 --> 01:58:01,400
曾經發生過啲交通意外嘅位置，係希望可以加設呢一啲誒過路設施嘅噉，但係誒地區上面誒部門嘅同事都可能因為各種嘅原因誒誒，可能未必做得到。再頂籠咧，就係喺個地面度可能都會有啲顏色啊，令到佢嗰個誒嘅更加顯眼，都未能夠設置呢啲相關嘅過路。

554
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:21,410
嘅誒嘅設備誒，而家我特別提咧就係深水埗嘅即係誒麗盈街誒，即係海盈邨去對面海濱長廊嗰個路口，因為曾經發生過多次嘅交通意外誒，特別係一啲即係小朋友上誒同埋誒長者喺早上或者傍晚會去嘅時候，呢個特別多嘅，即係都試過幾次。咁但係地區同時都係。

555
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:41,420
但係最多都淨能夠喺地面度畫啲顏色，誒改即係令佢睇顯眼啲啦。但係都冇辦法可以做到呢一個黃波燈噉，所以我都想了解個標準上面究竟係咪真係要即係小意外唔得嘅，要大意外死人先至做得嘅咧？即係呢啲位置，即係我想向體恤處方個標準係或者部門嘅標準係點咧？多謝主席。好啊，就請政府。

556
01:58:41,420 --> 01:59:01,430
回應之前咧，就我注意到時間，我哋都接近十二點鐘，我哋原定會議結束時間噉，我想誒延展十五分鐘咧，即係應該喺餘下時間可以處理埋其他嘅討論同埋個下一個議題。我想啊，副局長，係啊，主席誒，其實啊，梁議員其實係講緊係加一。

557
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:21,440
一個過路嘅裝置，即係唔止係加個黃波燈，因為而家我哋如果有斑馬線嘅地方咧，都係會有裝個黃波燈嘅。所以佢佢而家嘅提問咧就係話，可唔可以加多個類似斑馬線嘅嘅過路？咁嗰個標準嚟講咧，我就請阿請阿誒運輸處誒誒講一講啊，即係話誒喺咩？

558
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:57,930
係啊，誒胡生係咪？係係誒香港有唔同嘅行人過路處啦。咁地面嘅行人過路處有斑馬線啊、交通燈控制嘅路口啊、行人輔助線等等呢幾種唔同嘅。咁喺選擇唔同類型嘅誒行人過路設施嗰陣時候咧，我哋會考慮唔同嘅因素，例如道路環境啦。

559
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:18,050
誒車輛嘅流量啦，行人嘅流量啦，車速限制啊、意外記錄等等，咁喺一啲誒人流車流相對唔係太誒繁忙嘅過路處咧，誒設置一個斑馬線咧，可能喺個較佳嘅選擇嘅。至於誒一個具體情況誒，可能正話你提到嗰個地點咧，誒如果。

560
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:46,830
係誒梁宇有冇跟住？我諗誒主席，即係誒，因為其實過去都同地區嘅部門、前線同事都有溝通嘅。噉佢都解釋咗頭先類似你哋睇嘅原因。咁但係因為其實而家我所瞭解到，就算加咗喺地面度有咗唔同嘅顏色咧，誒都誒未能夠即係好完全可以替造翻一個安全。

561
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:44,080
咁誒誒嗰個東湧嗰個試驗計劃嗰個情況，請運輸署嘅同事誒介紹下。

562
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:17,700
可唔可以喺呢個階段，你透露一下嗰個誒目前嘅情況？最新就同我哋交代一下。

563
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:29,710
香港嘅環境喺香港唔同嘅路況咧，會邊啲係適合，邊啲唔適合啊？噉樣啊。好，誒，我哋瞭解到呢一類嘅倒數器咧，其實就個供應商嘅品種都唔少嘅。

564
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:57,040
我誒主席，噉我哋喺東湧之前喺達東路有個過路處咧，就試咗個我哋新款嘅，即係叫做誒行人過路倒數器嘅。咁喺嗰個位置咧，噉我哋見到。

565
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:51,260
咁到最後賣數個金額係幾多度咧？即係可唔可以提供啊？如果而家手邊冇唔緊要，可以會後提供嘅。噉我啲關心就安裝咗之後係咪你哋都進一步去誒，即係瞭解咗佢嗰個成效咧噉。

566
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:16,960
誒，首先我都發言表示支持呢一個誒建議啦，因為始終都係利民便民，尤其是仲有機會係涉及到交通安全嘅考慮嘅話咧，呢啲嘅設施係需要嘅。

567
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:37,250
咁頭先誒，我聽到誒覺得各位委員咧都表示即係支持呢一個即係有關裝置嘅安裝，但係當然接落嚟嘅時候就係嗰個誒公堂嘅適當運用啦，即係究竟個造價幾多咧？係咪可以進一步節省咧？而且喺個更換嘅過程之中會。

568
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:57,260
唔會誒有一啲措施係避免到，即係你譬如打交通嘅時候，影響咗啲即係道路使用者啊等等嗰啲。噉我哋深信運輸署都係即係好有經驗喺呢方面去逐步推行嘅噉。噉啊，我想問就係除咗誒今天講呢兩個題目之外咧，噉啊，關於呢啲。

569
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:17,270
道路設施嘅誒，頭先局方都提過有個過路處投射紅光輔助嘅誒設施，咁噉啊，我哋又多謝運輸處有幾次就同我去到現場望過啊，睇下嗰個功能同埋作用同埋將來設計點樣可以進一步優化啦，咁咁誒跟。

570
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:37,280
據誒之前嘅資料，就係二零二三年十一月開始就喺各區共約一百個行人過路處就裝呢個紅光嘅輔助裝置。咁應該就係喺二零二四年十二月底咧就完成㗎啦。噉我我想問下，即係如果完成咗之後，其實就按照誒從前個預算。

571
02:02:51,540 --> 02:03:11,550
呢個第一個，第二個就係又係二零二三年喺東湧達東路美東街燈控行人過路柱就裝咗個新款嘅行人交通燈倒數器嘅，噉啊進行測試嘅噉。咁原計劃就應該係喺二零二四年年中就完成㗎啦。噉我想。

572
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:38,000
好啊！唔該，戴副局係第二個問題，我請同事誒講講。第一個問題咧，就其實誒我可以誒誒政誒講咧，就係話嗰個安裝工程咧喺舊年嘅年底就全部完成㗎啦。至於話嗰個最後嗰個費用咧，因為而家手頭上冇嗰個數據，噉我哋誒會後誒揾翻誒報報告翻畀阿主席聽啊。

573
02:06:39,490 --> 02:06:43,780
你哋出席呢個會議，並提供一啲誒適當嘅回應。

574
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:52,690
下一個議程咧就係誒其他事項嘅，咁如果大家冇其他事項嘅話咧，我就宣佈會議結束。多謝大家。

575
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:38,980
啊！咁有冇打算？你將來嗰十六套都係可以試下不同嘅誒技術或者供應商嘅提供嘅設備咧？

576
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:17,640
嗰個倒數器咧，個功效咧，同以前我哋十幾年前試過嗰兩轉咧，就係有啲唔同。佢係帶到有少少嘅改善嘅，咁見得到呢一個噉嘅位置啦。噉我哋亦都明白，因為淨係得喺東湧一個位置去試咧，就未必可以代表到香港其他嘅路段。

577
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:37,650
嘅噉，所以咧，我哋其實已經着手咧，就喺香港揾咗其餘其他地方有十六個有代表性嘅路段咧，係再做一個進一步嘅測試，為嘅咧就係要確立到底喺東湧嗰個見得到嘅成效咧，係咪咁即係正面啦，同埋。

578
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:57,660
如果唔係嘅，咁喺啲乜嘢路段，佢係適合，有啲咩路段係唔適合？咁等我哋將來可以有個方向去點樣去向前行嚇。咁呢個就係嗰個東湧嗰個倒數器嘅試驗嘅情況。多謝。Professor，即係佢，即係換句説話講，個具體計劃未有嘅，就打算就以東湧嗰個成效，然後又睇下。

579
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:17,670
啊！擴展到誒全港九新界有邊啲地方可以再進一步做測試？誒，我哋揾到十六個位置咧，再做多一次試驗嘅。咁而家就進行中啦，嚇咁未落地嘅。咁試嗰呢十六個做完之後咧，噉我哋就可以有個即係叫睇法啦，就係呢啲新嘅倒數器咧喺香。

580
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:59,470
誒，我哋主要就針對嗰個功能啦，即係我哋就唔會即係即係話要揾邊個供應商噉嘅。咁例如我哋喺嚟緊呢十六個位置咧，咁有四個位置咧，我哋會增添一個功能試埋嘅。而家我哋喺東湧嗰個咧就係綠色公仔倒數啊嘛，噉我哋。

581
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:19,480
喺嚟緊個十六個裏邊有四個，除咗綠色公仔倒數之外咧，我哋會再試埋就紅色嘅公仔倒數。咁等啲等候緊過馬路嘅行人咧，就有希望佢有個掌握，就係知道佢會等多幾耐咧，就變咗做綠燈試下佢會唔會噉樣會增加到佢等候嘅耐。

582
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:39,490
性咁呢個亦都係一個新嘅嘗試嚟嘅。嗯，好唔該曬。噉啊，我哋誒就住呢一個題目提升及優化行人過路設施，就大家討論完畢。噉我哋進入誒下一個誒項目之前，我就多謝運輸局同埋運輸局誒運輸處嘅代表，多謝。
