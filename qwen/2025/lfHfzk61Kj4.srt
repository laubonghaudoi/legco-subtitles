26
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:23,600
二零二四年嘅財政年度咧，對於香港迪士尼嚟講咧，係破紀錄嘅一年嚟嘅。縱觀全年咧，誒樂園總嘅入場人次係按年上升咗百分之二十一，去到七百七十萬。事實上咧，係自二零零五年開幕以嚟咧嘅歷史新高嚟嘅。EBITDA即係話。

27
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:43,610
未扣除利息税項折舊同埋攤銷前嘅盈利咧，係增長至歷史新高嘅二十三億二千三百萬元。啊，亦都係咧誒淨利潤創歷史新高嘅八億三千八百萬元嘅。誒喺我哋香港迪士尼樂園，當然係香港十分重要嘅旅遊景。

28
00:03:43,610 --> 00:04:03,620
點根據二零二四年誒香港旅遊發展局嘅訪客訪港旅客分析報告咧，喺最受過夜旅客歡迎嘅香港付費景點排名之中咧，迪士尼係排第一嘅。除咗係提升香港嘅吸引力之外咧，香港迪士尼亦都係帶嚟可觀嘅經濟效益，累計。

29
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:23,630
嘅增加值咧係達到一千四百九十一億港元嘅。咁作為本港旅遊同埋家庭娛樂行業最大嘅僱主之一咧，香港迪士尼亦都帶嚟大量嘅就業機會，培育包括款待、工程、創意同埋設計等領域嘅專才，亦都係投資於青年發展嘅。與此同，

30
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:52,750
今年咧係香港迪士尼誒樂園咧係會慶祝開幕二十週年，由今年嘅六月起咧會推出一係列嘅全新節目，包括咧週年限定嘅城堡舞台表演、歷來規模最大嘅花車巡遊表演，以及特別版嘅夜光夜間光影匯影等等嘅誒。

31
00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:12,760
香港迪士尼將會聯同旅發局、旅遊業界同埋合作夥伴，繼續喺唔同嘅客源市場咧，係進行針對性嘅宣傳推廣，吸引更多旅客到訪嘅。至於未來發展方面咧，正如香港旅遊業發展藍圖二點二點零所講咧，文體旅局會繼續同華特迪士尼公司緊密合作，推。

32
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:32,770
推進跨年擴展計劃餘下嘅項目，其中係包括以漫威Marvel為主題嘅新園區，同埋亦都會探討未來嘅計劃，提升迪士尼對旅客嘅吸引力，確保業務嘅協同效應，同埋鞏固咧香港迪士尼樂園作為香港標誌性旅。

33
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,540
Thank you, Madam Chair.

34
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,810
Revenue and EBITDA.

35
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,280
We have delivered record financial results across the board in fiscal twenty four.

36
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,740
我 proud to report that we have continued to grow from strength to to strength.

37
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,030
We are incredibly proud of our results and the positive impact we have made on Hong Kong.

38
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,480
香港迪士尼樂園made history with record profit during fiscal 24，along with record high attendance.

39
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,780
We lead the way in Hong Kong's Hong Kong's tourism growth, creating a unique tourist destination in the Greater Bay Area.

40
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,620
We have also been preparing for the future, positioning Hong Kong Disneyland for sustained growth and contributions to the city in the future.

41
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:38,460
我誒，

42
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:47,160
23， how we were emerging from the challenges of the pandemic， and how we were establishing ourselves as a key driver of Hong Kong tourism.

43
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:42,740
旅遊景點嘅地位，其中咧，香港迪士尼最近亦都宣佈咗咧，會自資擴建全新嘅披薩比斯主題樂誒娛樂體驗嘅。

44
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:37,510
Today, I'm pleased to share with you that fiscal 24 has been a magical year for Hong Kong Disneyland. Last year, we we shared how we turned turned profitable during calendar.

45
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:07,560
As we approach our 20th anniversary, we have become a fixture in Hong Kong as its top paid attraction, a bright spot for tourism in the region, and proud to be Hong Kong's flag flagship tourist destination.

46
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:30,260
However, it's important to remember that all of us are still managing through the lasting impacts of COVID nineteen on the travel industry, and when combined with regional macroeconomic factors as well as a slow economy, we can see that the market is undergoing a significant transformation.

47
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:22,570
漁山旅遊島發展方方方向嘅重要一環，結合北大漁嘅休閒康樂元素同埋南大漁嘅生態旅遊元素。咁而家咧，我請阿莫偉庭先生向委員介紹迪士尼營運情況。多謝主席。Thank you。多謝Mr Moriarty。Your your turn to say something。

48
00:05:43,170 --> 00:06:03,180
噉啊，香港迪士尼作為國際級嘅度假區咧，喺推動香港以至大灣區嘅旅遊發展咧，係擔當重要嘅角色嘅。與此同時咧，憑藉佢嘅主題樂園啦，同埋係三間度假式嘅酒店咧，香港迪士尼亦都將會成為政府喺藍圖二點零裡面提出深化大。

49
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,160
台灣、泰國、日本和新加坡。

50
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:17,000
Our top five source markets outside of Hong Kong and the mainland are the Philippines.

51
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,300
Our increased cash flow has allowed us to accelerate our loan repayments as well as invest in new guest experiences.

52
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,770
We have also utilised this cash flow to invest in our future, which we will talk more about later in the presentation.

53
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,970
所以，Despite arrivals being below pre-pandemic levels, Hong Kong remains a top tourist destination in the world.

54
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:55,590
We saw record high attendance, up 21% to 7.7 million, with a balanced mix of guests from all around the world.

55
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:03,840
Our strong business performance has significantly improved our cash position, with cash and equivalents increasing twenty-eight percent.

56
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:54,870
not only are we driving direct value, but Hong Kong Disneyland guests spent an additional 21.6 billion dollars while visiting Hong Kong.

57
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:18,270
We have generated historic results across the board with net profit of 838 million, representing a year-on-year improvement of 1.2 billion.

58
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:28,770
54% increase in revenue to 8.8 billion， along with prudent cost management， improving EBITDA to more than 2.3 billion。

59
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:54,680
lastly, like to thank both of our shareholders, the Hong Kong government as well as the Walt Disney Company, who have been incredibly supportive of our commitment to continue investing in our future.

60
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:37,910
We've also started to repay the term loans from the Hong Kong government and the Walt Disney Company, and as of the first quarter of this fiscal year, we have already repaid about two thirds of our term loans.

61
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:44,840
for nearly two decades, we have offered a unique Disney storytelling and authentic experiences to locals and tourists alike, transforming the industry, becoming an icon for Hong Kong's tourism as its top paid attraction.

62
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:25,590
The Walt Disney Company provided a revolver facility during the COVID pandemic, which Hong Kong Disneyland did not draw on in fiscal twenty four. In fact, we fully repaid the outstanding balance in the first quarter of fiscal twenty four.

63
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:10,620
I'm delighted to share that attendance from all segments, local, mainland China and other markets, surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 18, and our non-local attendance growth continuing to outpace Hong Kong's overall arrival growth.

64
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:43,930
Achieving this level of success under the unfavourable market conditions cannot be done alone. We appreciate all of our guests, our stakeholders and supporters, who have become friends and advocates, who have stood by us since day one.

65
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,790
和GBA主land城市。

66
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,210
It is our hope to share this magical moment with everyone.

67
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,380
來到香港，歡迎各位蒞臨。

68
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,070
The impact of Hong Kong Disneyland's magic extends beyond the financial and into the hearts of those who need us the most.

69
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,810
We also launched Hong Kong's largest social adaptation training program for children with special educational needs.

70
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:45,570
Last year, we donated more than one hundred thousand park tickets to NGOs, bringing happiness to every corner of the community.

71
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,510
Our cast members have also given more than one hundred and twenty-three thousand hours since we've opened to help those in need.

72
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:04,510
It's this type of contribution that has paid for Hong Kong Disneyland's investment and makes us an important part of Hong Kong's economic future.

73
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:13,650
In fact, the government has mentioned in 2016 that Hong Kong Disneyland has achieved economic break-even by 2012.

74
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:59,410
To empower youth across boundaries, the Disney Imagination Hong Kong Design Competition invited guests from the GBA as well as international universities to join.

75
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:37,260
And our 10K weekend continued to be very popular, attracting a record-breaking 20,000 runners, making a record number of participants from international destinations as well.

76
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:26,230
香港迪士尼樂園繼續支持本地體育發展，由舉辦回歸慶祝會為香港中華代表團參加巴黎2024奧運會。

77
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:11,480
We also organised our first performing arts inspiration program, a magical odyssey in music, for local and other cities' youth. The program featured young artists from the Philippines, Hong Kong.

78
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:09,720
To expand upon the impact of Hong Kong Disneyland's magic to those who need us, I am thrilled to announce that in celebration of our twentieth anniversary, we will double our donation of complimentary tickets to two hundred thousand to the community this year.

79
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:29,910
作為一個個別公司，去年我們貢獻了超過120億美元給香港的總GDP，並創造了超過2,000個就業機會。我們非常驕傲地回饋我們的城市，並為香港人民帶來價值。

80
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,720

Take part in this special celebration, available only at Hong Kong Disneyland.

84
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,480
As I mentioned just now, we are celebrating a very special milestone in 2025.

85
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:28,900
We are also leveraging the leveraging the strong network at the Walt Disney Company to amplify the buzz and noise of this campaign to all the Disney fans around the world.

86
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:48,370
The steadfast support of our guests and the unwavering dedication of our cast members are important in driving our success and strengthening Hong Kong's tourism.

87
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:25,090
In addition to the 20th anniversary offerings, we have confirmed another project that is entirely funded by Hong Kong Disneyland, which is a Pixar entertainment experience.

88
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:54,210
Just like the successful launch of the world of Frozen, we will have a series of worldwide and regional publicity and promotions leading up to the launch of our twentieth anniversary celebration.

89
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:43,020
Everyone is saying how Hong Kong is back now, and as we enter our 20th year in 2025, we will make it not only a celebration for Hong Kong Disneyland, but a celebration and mega event for all of Hong Kong.

90
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:17,650
Hong Kong Disneyland provided over 380,000 hours of professional and technical training to our staff last year because we firmly believe that investing in our talent is an investment in our future success.

91
00:13:48,650 --> 00:14:03,360
Our achievements would not be possible without them. On average, Hong Kong Disneyland employed about 9,000 staff members during 2024, remaining one of Hong Kong's largest employers in the tourism and family entertainment industry.

92
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:43,140
Following the successful launch of the World of Frozen in 2023, and our current expansion plans with more Marvel themed experiences as well for our guest offerings, also in development, and with the support of our shareholders, Hong Kong Disneyland has a solid pipeline for our future growth.

93
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:34,560
Looking back at 2024, Hong Kong Disneyland continued to bring happiness and support the community as we launched Play Well with Disney at Hong Kong's Children's Hospital and served more than 800 children and their families. We also joined hands with Make-A-Wish Hong Kong to host Summer Snow Day Wishes Celebration at the World of.

94
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:14,500
since mid February, our team has been and will continue to visit seven international markets to conduct trade briefings for our twenty th anniversary celebrations. In the coming months, I'll be with the team in Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines and mainland China, working with our partners in the trade industry to invite everyone to come to Hong Kong.

95
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,360

突破一樣嘢，但係酒店入住率咧，誒就七十三個percent，十年前咧就九十三。

118
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:38,760
因為間酒店整改緊咧，因為仲有其他嘅一啲原因，你哋分析過係可以再做好啲咧。咁依個第一點。嗱，第二點咧就喺誒。

119
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:48,200
Thank you for your observation on the cars travelling into Hong Kong and the availability on Lantau. We're very close to the situation and we're looking for opportunities on how we can work together there.

120
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:23,980
起碼會唔會有一啲即係，哎我一定要全球六個，我都要睇過嘅。而香港呢啲有咩特點，佢未睇過，噉樣去吸引到即係你哋啲長遠嘅、長久嘅支持者嚟香港咧？多謝主席。

121
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:44,780
邊位答啊？誒主席，我我或者講一個小point就係誒，我哋頭先講嘅漫威同埋Pizza比斯嗰兩個嘅誒新嘅園區咧，誒政府都係無需額外注資嘅。誒漫威嗰個已經有發展基金係喺度，咁而至於比斯嗰個咧就會係用盈利咧係。

122
00:19:52,630 --> 00:20:12,640
Thank you, Madam Chair. As we focus on investment right now, our focus is very, very close in. As I mentioned, the 20th anniversary will feature a Newcastle State Show, a new parade. In fact, it's the largest parade that we've ever had at the resort, as well as in addition to our nighttime spectacular in Momentus.

123
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:32,650
After that, of course, will be the Pixar Entertainment experience, and then Marvel. So I think we have a very solid lineup. I think any discussions about expansion after that will really have to be to the shareholders. And as it relates, just to repeat again, as it relates to any additional funding, we have no plans to come back.

124
00:20:48,480 --> 00:21:08,490
As it relates to visas and the addition of visas, making Hong Kong effectively more friction free to visit, we welcome any of those policy changes, not just from the mainland, but for other countries in Southeast Asia. As we look at one of the opportunities that have come from that, as you mentioned, the GBA.

125
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:28,500
And the focus on all of the cities in the GBA, our fastest growing segment within our Magic Access program, which is our annual pass program, is in fact guests from the GBA. So we are finding those guests that think of Hong Kong as part of their living circle are really attracted to that product and coming to Hong Kong Disneyland for.

126
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:53,210
主席，就誒，我諗迪迪士尼個表現隨住香港個旅遊誒發展復甦，依個絕對係好事嚟㗎。數字反映到，我兩個具體嘅問題，我想了解一下。嗱，就對比十年前咧，其實誒喺個誒入園率咧，佢個。

127
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:28,390
嚇噉，我都理解咧。即係當中有一間酒店喺度誒整修整修緊，噉就誒你有信心咧。即係整完之後咧，就可能嗰個使用率去到八十八。噉我第一個問題咧，我想問翻，即係喺呢個入住率呢方面嚟講咧，即係依家都仲有少少差距咧，係咪純粹係一？

128
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:10,890
係。

129
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,240
係。

130
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,650
no no further points to add.

131
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,560
No, ma'am. I think I I answered both questions.

132
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,240
噉我都有兩個小問題想問一問嘅。一方面想問一問誒局方。

133
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,950
冇冇跟進啦嚇，林議員嚇。噉啊，下一位姚柏良議員。

134
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,690
誒都係主席，主席好高興見到迪士尼樂園咧，即係盈利創新高。

135
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:21,230
界咧，去能夠為我哋香港去鞏固呢個世界級誒首選旅遊目的地而作出貢獻嘅。

136
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:36,260
其實喺文件裏邊咧，我都好高興睇到，即係十五段裏邊提到，即係藍圖二點零咧，提出迪士尼將會成為深化大嶼山旅遊島嘅重要一環。

137
00:24:48,040 --> 00:25:01,300
What is unique and special about us in Hong Kong? We do not have a database for all six parks and who those fans might be, but they do. They do come. They do come to Hong Kong and visit us here.

138
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:47,540
10 years ago, the resort was operating two hotels, roughly a thousand hotel rooms, between the Disneyland Hotel and the Disney Hollywood Hotel. Subsequently, we've opened up a third hotel with 750 rooms.

139
00:22:49,970 --> 00:23:09,980
本身你有冇一個系統，即係喺於主題公園又好，或者係即係其他啊迪士尼誒相關主題嘅愛好者，有冇啲我哋俗稱所謂鐵粉？你哋有冇一啲噉嘅資料庫係可以咧，係幫到你哋去推廣就係香港依個主題樂園依個特色嚇誒？係。

140
00:23:47,880 --> 00:24:07,890
And so that is part of the reason reason why occupancy is lower. We've added a lot more hotel rooms. I think it's also important to recall that part of last fiscal year was still during a time of recovery for international and overnight vacation arrivals in Hong Kong.

141
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:27,900
And so I think it's really reflective of that. In fact, I think we're very proud of how the hotels are performing this this fiscal year, certainly above pre-COVID levels. We, as it relates to your question on VIPs, we have a wonderful program that guests can join called the My

142
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:47,910
Disney fans account and we often provide regular benefits to them. As it relates to a worldwide database, while there are many fans that that enjoy all Disney parks and we see that happening quite frequently, especially from around the region. We see guests from Shanghai and from Tokyo coming to visit.

143
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:53,980
噉啊，無論入場嘅人次啊，即係新增嘅客源啊，以致到即係酒店各方面嘅呢個指標咧，都係一個有個可觀嘅增長嘅。噉啊，作為旅遊業界咧，我真係非常之樂見。噉啊，都睇到即係迪士尼樂園咧，其實喺過去疫情期間，以致到呢一兩年嘅嗰個努力咧，係。

144
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:13,990
見到個成果，噉啊，正正就係睇到即係不斷創新個產品、創新個體驗咧，就能夠把握到呢個即係疫情之後呢兩年復甦嘅呢個機遇，所以能夠有噉啊好嘅業績。噉啊，今年亦都係二十週年啦，噉啊都希望元芳繼續努力去引領我哋旅遊業。

145
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
多謝，主席。

146
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,560
有，我都可以講話係世界級嘅景點。呢個昂平山六零。

147
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:28,220
客人可以有啲嘅特別嘅優惠，而令到佢哋可以能夠助力我哋將呢啲過境或者轉機客咧變成入境客，都係主席。

148
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:59,440
引領我哋旅遊業界，令到我哋業界大家個個唔同嘅前份者都都能夠得益，呢個都係希望迪士尼能夠發揮到呢個功能。

149
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:30,510
運輸物流局嗱，其實你最左呢呢三個局咧，即係誒機管局就係運輸物流局睇㗎啦。咁噉啊發展局又睇緊成個南南大嶼嘅發展。

150
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:46,000
共用，因為我哋都會有新嘢，噉就誒，我哋亦都應該要同其他嘅，譬如話發展局啊，或者係運輸物流局咧，就係有更加緊密嘅溝通，大家一齊去做好呢件事嘅。噉啊，第二個問題，我交畀阿莫先生啊，主席。Good morning，阿Chief。嗯。

151
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:56,550
咁呢個大嶼山大嶼山旅遊島咧都講咗好多年啦。噉我哋嗰陣時提話喺其實大嶼山咧係絕對有潛力可以能夠發展成為世界級嘅國際旅遊島，因為我哋有世界級嘅一個國際機場，我哋有世界級嘅景點迪士尼樂園，亦都。

152
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:20,990
咁仲有我哋大嶼山、大嶼南呢邊咧，都係有世界級嘅生態旅遊資源。咁呢方面咧，但係我就到今天嚟講，都仲係希望即係誒局方可唔可以話到少少畀我聽，即係而家文體旅局誒同呢個旅誒同呢個發展局同。

153
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:50,800
咁呢方面嚟講，即係有冇啲具體嘅一啲嘅即係工作嘅措施啊，或者個方案咧？點樣去打造大嶼山成為一個誒世界級嘅即係呢個國際旅遊島啊？呢個其中一個即係比較大啲嘅問題。另一個細啲嘅問題咧，想問問即係迪士尼嘅，其實就即係。

154
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:19,730
噉啊！而家我哋希望喺嗰個客源開拓嗰方面，特別係我諗誒啲誒過境客誒或者轉機客，希望能夠吸引佢哋成為入境客。噉我覺得迪士尼咧呢度可以即係絕對有能力可以利用你哋嘅品牌嘅效應去做多啲，或者會唔會特別針對呢啲嘅客？

155
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:48,810
局長呢個問題，局長好啊，好啊。誒，多謝主席，多謝姚議員。其實冇錯嘅大嶼山旅遊島咧，其實大嶼山呢個整體發展同迪士尼嘅協同效應，二戰岸平三岸平呢個題目，我哋都喺議會又討論咗好耐。現在個契機真係好明顯啦，因為咧，其實我哋將來呢幾年咧喺大嶼山。

156
00:28:48,810 --> 00:29:08,820
真係會有好多嘅發展嘅。首先，誒香港國際機場嗰邊已經機管局宣佈咗佢哋SkyCity嗰樣嘢。咁SkyCity包括有即係好多嘅當然商業嘅元素，但係更重要嘅咧，佢哋會有譬如話係誒停泊遊艇嘅地方，可以讓好多嘅遊艇嚟得到啦。另外，

157
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:28,830
又亦都會有一啲即係唔同嘅好吸引人嘅新嘅嘅誒景點，咁同埋藝術品嘅一啲嘅畫廊啊等等，咁都可以咧吸引到唔同嘅遊客咧。佢會喺誒機場嘅附近咧，係會用更得更加多嘅時間。咁同時咧，迪士尼都係可以有個協同效應。咁第二樣嘢咧。

158
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,690
嗯。

159
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,740
嗯。

160
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,550
好值得讚賞。

161
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,120
整體上睇個數字。

162
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,490
好啦，跟住係陳勇議員。

163
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:26,190
整體嘅旅遊啊，香港經濟嘅發展咧，可以有額外現金呢方面嘅財政嘅支持咧，我想了解一樣嘅，多謝主席。

164
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,860
Keep people in Hong Kong as they as they transit from other locations. As we serve as a hub, not just for tourism in Hong Kong, but for the Greater Bay Area as well.

165
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:48,840
係發展局而家都去大嶼山嗰度咧，係誒大嶼南咧，係邀請緊一啲嘅意向書，希望咧係可以喺嗰度睇睇嗰個度假旅店或者度假酒店嗰樣嘢啦。啊，度假區啊，會唔會有一啲嘅商業意向係可以提供到出嚟？有冇建議書？噉我都好希望嗰樣嘢咧係大家積極噉樣去提。

166
00:29:48,840 --> 00:30:08,850
啲建議嘅噉，粵車南下嘅機遇，剛才周文港議員都提過一啲噉，絕對迪士尼係應該把握呢個機遇，特別係如果車係可以去得到迪士尼嘅就更好啦。噉就可以成為第一站去旅遊。咁除此之外咧，其實誒亞博館咧亦都係興建緊佢嘅二期嘅二期嗰度咧會有一個好大嘅新。

167
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:28,860
新嘅表演嘅場地，噉我哋亦都覺得咧，同迪士尼漫威嗰個誒新嘅園區咧，嗰個落成嘅時間會相當接近，亦都係會有協同效應。咁頭先講咗咁多之後咧，其實誒未來嗰幾年的確係咧，誒迪士尼可以喺大嶼山旅遊島嗰度咧，喺發揮更大嘅功。

168
00:30:47,990 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, first of all, thank you for your congratulations and your support for Hong Kong Disneyland. Certainly, Lantau Island is a tourism hub with inbound traffic coming in, and we are one of those attractors both to Hong Kong and to Lantau Island. So, hopefully, there are some things that we can do together to help people.

169
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:57,000
你講睇得唔得？一誒而家有啦，係啦，即係話整體上咧嗰個成績係好值得讚賞嘅，因為誒我哋見我唔重複啲數字啦，即係淨利潤都百億幾咧，呢啲係好鼓舞嘅，尤其當而家整體上嗰個財政壓力咁大嘅時候，同埋咧遊客嘅人數啊，同埋呢樣嘢，我覺得除咗大家努

170
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:17,010
之外，都好多謝誒中央咧同埋國家畀我哋嗰個政策呢方面，局長特別熟悉啦，第手又親自去推動咧，同阿局長咁變咗整體上下流咧，同埋預預差嚟緊都會就係增加緊嘅，呢啲都係好消息。所以咧做好嗰個容量，即係擴容啊，同埋接待嗰個愉快感咧，保。

171
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:37,020
保持住呢個發展，令到人多再多啲，譬如再多四四成嘅話咧，我哋來源都能夠招呼得好，令到佢開心。呢個好關鍵就避免咧，即係話你佢多，但係我哋接待唔到咧，呢個又小心嘅。另外一個比較關心咧，誒讚賞嘅，我唔多講咧。整體上都係好值得讚賞啦。誒，我另外一個想關。

172
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:57,030
關注嘅就係話，我自己介別啲選民啊、選委都都會問多啲嘅。咁如果我冇理解錯咧，到二零二五年財政年度第一季咧，迪士尼已經償還咗超過六成嘅貸款㗎嘛，同埋咧誒有咁轉虧為盈咁好理想嘅盈利嘅時候咧，噉啊預測啊，噉啊而家即係整體政府財政壓力大嘅。

173
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:17,040
誒預計到幾耐到咧？按照而家當然建基而家，另外嗰四成嘅貸款咧可以能夠逐步完成啦。第二咧，誒就算未完成曬歸還咗好啦，但係咧就誒而家啲盈利裏邊有會唔會能夠有一部分可以回撥翻畀政府又好，或者對？

174
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:46,770
阿局長係主席。誒，其實咧，而家嘅誒迪士尼香港迪士尼樂園啦，喺誒即係對政府嘅誒貸款咧，其實仲有四成未還。咁呢四成咧，今年係會還還翻畀我哋㗎啦。但係咧，誒股東亦都同意咧，因為正如好似阿陳勇議員頭先講咧，我哋。

175
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,310
開咩？

176
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,450
Thank you, Madam Chair.

177
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,920
Mr. Moriarty。

178
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,580
Mr. Moriarty, anything to add?

179
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,280
香港嘅迪士尼更具吸引力，可以吸引嗰面即係中東嗰面嘅旅客咧。多謝主席。

180
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,890
咧喺噉嘅情況底下咧，攞咗呢啲錢嚟做一個新嘅吸引嘅園區咧，都係比較好一啲。咁多謝主席。嗯。

181
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:28,680
The value for money, the kindness of our cast members and the cast member experience, really across the board. So thank you for your comments there.

182
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:41,890
補充一句啫，主席就係話咧，好多都推陳出新啊！但係個米奇幻想曲嗰啲咧，睇咗好多年，最近都係嗰個咧提升下咧，會吸引好多誒熟客咧再翻轉頭嘅嚇，唔該。

183
00:33:46,770 --> 00:34:06,780
其實而家係好需要維持住第一擴容，讓我哋嘅樂園咧繼續可以推陳出新，亦都咧個容量越嚟越大，先至可以咧令到我哋嘅旅客嚟同埋有個好嘅體驗。咁呢個我哋十分同意嘅。咁所以咧，我哋亦都同意咧將呢啲嘅誒即係還嘅錢咧係可以攞嚟咧同誒華。

184
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:26,790
迪士尼公司嘅即係一樣，就係話將呢啲嘅錢留喺個樂園裏面，成為一個自資嘅新嘅誒，即係誒誒誒attraction。咁呢一個咧就係誒嗰個比斯嗰個就係會喺度噉樣去處理。咁而誒，我覺得呢樣嘢咧都係一件好嘅。

185
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:46,800
事情，因為誒當然咧，目前嚟講誒政府嘅財政狀況，我哋可能未必咁容易咧，係去做一啲好龐大嘅新嘅旅遊基建。但係，如果迪士尼係有能力喺用嗰個還款嗰度可以做一啲自資嘅新嘅具吸引力噉，而比斯都係一個好嘅題材。噉我哋就覺得。

186
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:18,160
Yes, Madam Chair, thank you very much for your comments and and concerns on overall capacity, as it's so highly correlated with our overall guest experience. I am proud to say that our guest experience has continued to improve year over year, not just in terms of the overall experience, but in terms of

187
00:35:42,170 --> 00:36:02,180
誒，下一位黃俊石議員，好啊！誒，多謝主席。主席，我記得咧，舊年五月嘅時候，我依度都係迪士尼啦。噉啊，比較關注就係佢哋嘅誒財務事宜啦。即係作為一個會計師，噉啊，亦都見到佢而家轉虧為盈。我哋見到個net profit都去到有八億嚇。噉啊，亦都係頭先啊，局長講有record high啊，噉啊。

188
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:22,190
恭喜翻迪士尼先噉啊！關於即係過往嘅嘢，就之前問過啦。而家我就係想問將來噉啊，亦都見到咧，其實有好多嘅旅客啊，即係由誒即係東民啊或者菲律賓咧，都其實好多都過嚟香港依面啦。噉啊，特區政府我哋而家都係即係好多時都係瞄準中東嗰面嘅市場。噉我又想問一問香。

189
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:42,200
香港迪士尼，我哋有幾多嘅啊，即係資源啊，或者宣傳係去中東嗰邊嘅市場咧？因為即係而家我哋見到好多中東嗰邊嘅國家嘅對香港一個迪士尼都比較弱啊。咁而且好多時佢哋都香即係取近就即係寫近就取遠去咗法國嘅迪士尼。噉我哋點樣可以宣傳多啲？等香

190
00:36:53,080 --> 00:37:13,090
Well, one of our primary appeals as a resort in Hong Kong is our international appeal, and I think that's why we do attract so many international guests, not just from Southeast Asia or North Asia, but really from all over the world. In fact, if you were to look at you know Southeast Asia.

191
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,080
咁成績係非常之理想。

192
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,670
啊，主席，我話想算一算帳咧。

193
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,960
誒好細心啦嚇，陳少紅姨。

194
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:58,600
Food and beverage offerings that are appealing to guests from from Muslim countries.

195
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:22,030
係歷史新高點啊！去到八點三八億，呢個真係值得誒，即係祝賀嘅。

196
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,930
These fronts, it's one of our, I think, biggest appeals and biggest contributions to Hong Kong tourism.

197
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:32,710
Both for outdoor vending as well as restaurants, and we have prayer rooms for both genders. Yeah, facing the east. Yes. Thank you.

198
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:21,780
數啦，誒旅遊咪展，噉我都會去參與，同埋會去誒呢兩個地方嘅誒同當地嘅旅遊官員啦，或者係業界嘅一啲主要持份者咧去會面，親身去推廣咧香港作為一個即係畀中東朋友嘅一個度假勝地。多謝主席。

199
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:33,100
roughly one in five people on every on every every seat on every airplane is coming to Hong Kong Disneyland. If you were to look at what we are doing right now in the Middle East, certainly our partnership with HKTB, we are there with them in lockstep. But if you were to look at our attendance from arrival.

200
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:53,110
Middle East, it's one out of every three person on every plane. So I think we are very attractive to our guests in the Middle East. But not only that, but guests from Malaysia and Indonesia as well as we have worked hard to implement a lot of facilities, infrastructure, policies and.

201
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:18,890
the the work is going to continue on as I mentioned earlier in the presentation we were going to be in all of our core markets promoting Hong Kong internationally in fact next week I'm going to be in Southeast Asia promoting our 20th anniversary with all of our travel trade partners and we'll continue along.

202
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:45,610
啊！主席，我都補充一句，誒喺迪士尼嗰方面，當然佢哋會做佢哋自己嘅推廣工作。剛才阿莫先生都提到，誒其實咧啊，每三個嚟香港嘅係坐飛機嚟嘅中東旅客咧，有一個已經會去迪士尼。咁呢個係一個誒好大嘅數字。咁但係我諗比。

203
00:38:45,610 --> 00:39:05,620
呢個精結就係我哋想希望吸引更多嘅中東旅客嚟香港。咁誒，其實咧我自己個人咧都會，本人都會帶團咧係連誒喺咁個月尾嘅時候，我哋會去杜拜同埋會去沙地阿拉伯。咁咧就係專門喺杜拜咧有一個旅遊業界嘅誒一個所謂trave

204
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:42,280
啊，黃宇好啊！多謝主席。誒，都聽到誒頭先局方啊，同埋誒迪士尼嘅回應啦。即係我諗去，即係我哋三個嚟香港嘅中東旅客有一個去迪士尼噉，當然呢個係一個好嘅數字。但係我哋而家我係想係增加個規模，即係我點樣將三個變到更加大，直情係我哋要做嘅。咁當然去T B有即係佢哋part。

205
00:39:42,280 --> 00:40:02,290
partner with T V去做其中一個方案啦，但係我哋真係要諗下，其實個市場咁龐大，資金咁多嘅時候，我哋係咪要有啲establishment喺嗰個度啊？或者一個即係長期嘅project，唔係一啲one off嘅。不過依個係一個小小意見，即係供迪士尼同埋局方去作一個長遠嘅參考，因為我哋依個都係同我哋而家成個香港政府嘅政策係要一致。

206
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:22,300
多謝主席。If I could jump the queue and but in, you know, to attract Middle East visitors, do you have halal food or facilities for prayers? Because I noticed from my visit to European resorts, they do have prayer areas. Yes, yes, Madam Chair, we have halal food offerings.

207
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,030
一七百七十萬。

208
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,310
又係四百幾億嘅。

209
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,550
應該我睇翻啲數字咧，就係一千。

210
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:19,930
我就睇下啦，樂園嘅設計最高容量係一千萬到。

211
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:29,470
咁如果七百七十萬嘅話咧，加上大家嘅努力底下，好快又會接近呢一千萬嘅高容量。咁不其然就令我諗起。

212
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:53,830
究竟中間有幾多係第一次或者係誒重複再嚟香港嘅？你有啲咩策略去再吸納或者係吸引佢哋多啲嚟咧？兩個問題，唔該主席。

213
00:42:49,760 --> 00:43:03,260
氛圍都唔係咁好嘅，嗱而家氛圍好咗啦，而家預計我哋都比較正面嘅。我想問下局長，係咪都有呢個打算開始去籌籌劃呢樣嘢咧？噉我第二個問題咧，都係講誒關於誒客流嗰方面嘅。

214
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:21,520
因為誒大嶼山旅遊島邊頭先啊誒有議員同事問咗我唔問誒，你而家喺誒二零二四年咧就本地同埋非本地大約係四十同埋六十個百分點之間，好嘅，即係非本地係佔百分之六十㗎啦。

215
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:56,380
誒主席，主席，我哋記得喺舊年本事務委員會傾同樣嘅題目嘅時候，阿莫偉霆先生誒就交代咗下喺舊年我哋討論嗰個時候已經係知道誒迪士尼樂園咧係將嗰個虧損啊收窄，咁當時已經係預計。

216
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:16,390
即係來年就應該誒唔錯嘅一個表現嘅噉。當然而家見到二零二四年誒轉虧為盈，而誒人數又增加到係七百七十萬嘅，即係人次總入場創開元以嚟嘅歷史新高。凡此種種，再加埋淨利潤又係。

217
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:47,630
誒記得喺一九九九年前後，當特區政府係確定要誒推動呢個迪士尼誒樂園嘅時候，有一啲數字嘅。其中一個咧就預計迪士尼樂園開完咗，即係開咗誒營業之後咧，大約係四十年內就會誒為香港帶嚟。

218
00:41:52,590 --> 00:42:12,600
咁今次阿局長連同埋文件都提過啦，喂！如果係按照過去十九年啊累計，已經幫香港嘅經濟增加咗又係一千四百幾億，即係話係達到標喎。呢個係係值得鼓舞，而且咧當時嘅估算咧就係都係誒十五年度嘅盈馴就有三百零萬，咁而家十九年度有。

219
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:49,760
我哋未來嚟計，局長係咪會同迪士尼真係傾一傾五年後、十年後，究竟迪士尼樂園係咪應該要擴容咧？咁擴容嘅時候，地從何來咁？噉我哋知道隔離有笪地嘅。噉啊，喺舊年嘅時候問阿即係前局長嘅時候，佢就話啊，未有噉嘅打算。咁當時個分

220
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:41,810
咁喺非本地入邊咧，有二十二個百分點咧，就係嚟自誒其他市場。咁頭先提嗰個中東嘅其中一個啦。噉我想問下，究竟你按照你嘅分析底下，我點樣再擴充多啲呢啲非本地而又係非內地嘅遊客嚟香港而？

221
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:14,460
誒主席，我我或者答出第一條先咧，因為呢個關於嗰個擴建啊噉樣，呢個係股東應該答嘅問題。誒，其實我哋地係有嘅，啊二期嘅地，誒當然我哋現在都冇一個長遠嘅誒一個具體嘅特別。

222
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:01,630
To all of that, improve me as as the macroeconomic situation and plane flight capacity increases.

223
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:34,470
指定咗嘅用途，咁所以咧誒，如果有需要嘅話，地係有嘅。誒，但係當然啦，其實大家都會剛才聽我哋嘅介紹，見到咧就係我哋其實仲有一啲嘅誒土地啦，喺一期裏面，我哋係可以擴建嘅。咁喺擴容裏面咧，每一次嘅擴容一個新嘅園區咧，其實我哋

224
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:54,480
都可以咧係有數以十萬嘅一啲新嘅所謂capacity係可以帶入個迪士尼樂園。咁因此咧，我哋其實而家咧，因為香港都寸金尺土，所以我哋其實而家亦都好希望咧可以用盡真係每一寸嘅土地。誒做到咧就係香港迪士尼，雖然個面積或許冇外地或者內地嘅。

225
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:14,490
迪士尼咁大，但係我哋有一個好大嘅長處咧，就係我哋麻雀雖小五臟俱全，同埋好快咧。我哋可以行到個園咧，玩到好多嘢。其實裝飛更加值錢嘅，咁呢個第一。第二咧就係話，當有一日我哋真係覺得咧，我哋係有需要去考慮一個新嘅園區嘅時候咧，或者係新嘅樂園嘅二期啊。

226
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:34,500
啊！等等嘅誒設施嘅時候咧，我哋亦都當然要考慮下嗰個誒客源啦，係咪有噉嘅需要咧？另外就係睇一睇股東嗰個所謂注資嘅呢個胃口啦，係點樣樣個維納係點樣樣？咁目前嚟講，當然我哋嘅園區未用曬，我哋仲可以有擴建，我哋仍然都可以。

227
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:54,510
有新嘅容量去提供出嚟咧，暫時當然未必即刻會諗一個好大嘅擴建，但係呢樣嘢咧，其實喺香港嚟講最重要就係有冇地啦。而家如果我哋暫時都係有地嘅話咧，呢一樣嘢我哋就係會喺我哋嘅reader screen啦，我哋會誒留心住嗰個睇嗰個進展嘅。多謝主席。噉啊，第二條問題我請。

228
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:14,520
暫時性生。Any Mr Moriarty, any points to add on expansion plans and how to encourage repeat visitors? Madam Chair, as we look as we look to expand our attendance and our occupancy, we look not just for repeat guests but also

229
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:34,530
First-timers as the markets of income-qualified tourists are coming into Hong Kong and and available to travel outbound from their markets. I think we are poised to really attract and be attractive to these people, but with events like the 20th anniversary and the new Pixar entertainment.

230
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:54,540
Expansion in Marvel, of course. After that, but I also think that Hong Kong is well prepared for it too, with the expansion of the third airport and the activities going on in Lantau, making it more attractive for and not just attractive, but the ability for people to come into to Hong Kong. So really looking forward.

231
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:26,390
好唔該啊，主席。誒，我都想跟進一個問題咧，就係其實誒迪士尼嘅二期用地喺早幾年的，而且確係啊政府曾經都一度公佈話，即係誒收翻先，然後再諗下究竟點樣誒處理點樣用啦噉。咁去到今日，我哋見到啊迪士尼。

232
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:46,400
今年嘅成績真係恭喜係做得好好嘅噉啊！八億嘅盈利，七百七十萬嘅人次啊！我會形容係奇幻經濟，即係呢個真真係奇幻經濟。咁誒，如果想延續呢個奇幻經濟咧，我都想進一步問啦。嗱，剛才局長都話呢個二期用地而家暫時你哋未。

233
00:47:46,400 --> 00:48:06,410
有即刻嘅諗法，但係會唔會你哋都可以借呢個契機咧，都同迪士尼，即係或者迪士尼亦都可以諗下。即係如果大家都覺得係有咁大嘅潛能，誒，我哋係其實有能力吸引到咁多嘅旅客，包括係內地好、海外嘅旅客都好，其實係絕對有條件可以做。

234
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,680
王先生。

235
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,170
誒。

236
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,180
Thank you。嚇，跟住周浩鼎議員。

237
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,500
噉我想問下咧，而家即係園樂園裏邊咧。

238
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,100
噉我想問咧，迪士尼有啲乜嘢嘅措施咧？即係喺即係。

239
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,720
嘅多謝主席。嗯，噉啊，跟住係誒陸仲紅議員。

240
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,700
另外一個咧，我關注咧嗰個誒人才方面嘅問題嘅。

241
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:23,160
多謝主席啊！噉啊，今次咧就迪士尼就人丁兩旺啦嚇，丁財兩旺，噉啊有一個好好嘅盈利。

242
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:56,760
即係人，即係遊客咁暢旺嘅情況之下咧，仍然保持到一啲遊客比較良好嘅誒遊玩嘅體驗，嗰個人潮嘅管理嘅措施。

243
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:16,700
咁誒，我睇到咧就文件第七段提到咧，迪士尼為其發展高技能同高質素嘅勞動力咧，年內就提供三十八萬二千幾個嘅專業嘅小時嘅培訓。

244
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:38,860
咁誒有幾個問題嘅，第一個問題咧就即係當然啦，人多係好事嚟嘅，但係咧即係我個人嚟講咧，我就好怕去啲人多嘅主題樂園嘅，噉啊排隊排好耐啊，有時嗰個遊玩體驗啊比較差嘅。

245
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:20,770
數目有幾多，同埋會唔會同更多嘅大專業啊合作？誒，設立呢啲噉樣嘅課程啊，或者係一啲工作機會嘅銜接機制，令到咧學院培訓咗呢啲人才咧，同企業嘅需求咧能夠精準咁對接啊，善用我哋香港嘅青年人才。唔該，主席。

246
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:26,420
多啲客嘅生意，你做得好，亦都係幫香港帶動經濟。我都想你奇幻經濟成功，所以可唔可以即係或者諗一諗？誒，我見到你哋而家咧，今次介紹咧，例如你而家園區裏面Marvel，你都話有啲誒迪士尼全資去誒發展嘅，即係有啲係佢全資揼錢落去做嘅一啲。

247
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:46,430
新嘅誒擴建嘅諗法做法，會唔會可以？局長都或者都再可以同進一步都同迪士尼探討下。喂，會唔會其實二期用地既然有機會攞到出嚟，而迪士尼都可以其實佢嘅方式亦都可以係佢自己全資都可以揼一啲去做一啲嘅擴建。當你嗰啲做得。

248
00:48:46,430 --> 00:49:06,440
得更加多吸引嘅嘢，咁嗰個迪士尼要鞏固佢呢個旅遊旗艦嘅地位，就越高嘅嗰個能力。所以我仲想聽下，即係局長呢方面有冇咩特別嘅諗法啫？係唔該，係。啊，局長係多謝主席。我諗或者澄清一下，就唔係迪士尼，唔係話得迪士尼公司去全資去做呢個事情。

249
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:26,450
因為咧，香港迪士尼樂園咧，其實嗰個誒經營嘅合作嘅模式咧，就係要香港政府作為大股東，同埋華特迪士尼公司作為誒小股東，兩邊咧係去合作嘅。咁所以，如果我哋喺現在喺一期裏邊咧，我哋樂園裏邊嘅誒。

250
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:46,460
要建設新嘅景點咧，有兩個方法嘅。主要一個方法咧就係當然經過股東嘅磋商，然之後咧大家願意係用唔同嘅方法去注資。有陣時可能係現金嘅注資，有陣時可能係以借貸嘅方式，亦都有時可能係以股本增加股本嘅資誒嘅方式去注資。咁呢個會係。

251
00:49:46,460 --> 00:50:06,470
係喺一啲大啲嘅發展計劃，譬如我哋當日起嘅第三間酒店啦，或者現時我哋嘅擴展計劃，包括埋萬威都係擴展計劃嘅下邊嘅其中一個嘅項目嚟嘅。噉我哋剛才話咧係可以存資，不需要股東再注資或者係再花誒花錢去做嘅咧，嗰個就係畀C Pizza嗰個。

252
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:26,480
咁嗰個咧就會係喺香港迪士尼樂園嘅營運嘅盈利裏面咧，係自己去自資。咁呢個所謂自資咧，就由香港迪士尼樂園噉。但係當然嗰個誒股權嘅分佈底下，都係政府同埋華特迪士尼公司共同擁有呢一啲嘅即係資本嘅。咁至於周。

253
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:46,490
議員頭先講，如果而家我哋持續向好的話，會唔會有一個我剛才所講嘅股東會唔會有個投資為立去諗一個新嘅即係園區啊，或者甚至係一個二期嘅樂園啊等等咧？咁呢個我哋有待觀察嗰個誒，即係誒客源係咪真係穩定地不斷增加？

254
00:50:46,490 --> 00:51:06,500
另一方面咧，就係亦都要諗諗個融資模式嘅，因為大家都明白過往我哋都嚟本會咧。如果係迪士尼有一個大嘅誒誒擴展嘅話咧，我哋必須要嚟本會係爭取撥款。咁喺目前嘅情況底下，我哋係咪咁容易，或者係咁應該嚟爭取撥款咧？咁呢個我會小心考慮。

255
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,340
Mr. Moriarty.

256
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,910
議長。

257
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,660
continued to be on the rise.

258
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,910
嗯，好，thank you。

259
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,290
誒，跟住咧就係張欣宇以。

260
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:59,490
work that we have, we like to say we don't offer jobs, we offer careers, but also also fair pay.

261
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:16,940
In fact, this year, our our merit and bonus was very healthy, and our cast was there, and that was in addition to our other programs that we have, including employee benefits and other training. That of course are all self-sufficient.

262
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:41,790
佢呢一方面嘅人才做唔做到自給自足咧，能唔能夠做到最大程度上減少誒輸入一啲外地嘅人手咧？嚇，即係我哋都希望，即係你能夠最大程度上去即係促進嗰個本地就業啦，係咪？

263
00:52:41,790 --> 00:53:01,800
第二個咧就係我都關注到咧，V.T.C.有個課程咧，就叫做主題公園及劇場創意科技高級文憑嘅。咁裏邊咧都有提到咧，話學生有機會去到誒迪士尼實習嘅。噉我想問下咧，即係園方咧去提供呢啲嘅實習嘅。

264
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:47,200
Thank you for your questions on our cast experience and our guest experience. One, as it relates to our overall guest experience, capacity is very important in terms of managing wait times and the overall experience of of our guests. It is something that we are are.

265
00:53:47,200 --> 00:54:07,210
very knowledgeable about and understand the relationship between the number of people in the park and ridership and the overall experience, etc. It's also something that we manage several ways. We we manage with a tiered pricing program, whereby on higher demanded days

266
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:27,220
We have higher tier pricing to keep attendance levels down. We also have programs where we take park reservations to make sure that we do not go over a certain desired amount of of guests in a park, so that we can ensure that a guest is having a good experience. As I mentioned earlier, our guest experiences.

267
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:50,350
As it relates to our cast members, thank you for asking about our 9,000 cast members. I think we view ourselves as a top employer in Hong Kong. In fact, during a very challenging labour market, we've been able to to grow our cast base. I think that has a lot to do with not only the great

268
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:44,400
好，都係主席噉啊。誒，第一個問題係想問翻關於個報告當中咧嗰個貸款嘅一啲數據嘅情況，見到喺嗰個流動負債嗰度咧，其實係誒提到係誒將政府嘅借款咧係誒由今年開始誒即係當成一個流動嘅負債。咁頭先亦都聽到喺個回應當中咧就話。

269
00:55:44,400 --> 00:56:04,410
話啊，係今年其實啊，迪士尼公司就應該會將政府嘅負債係全部還清，係咪？誒，想確認下呢一樣嘢。咁但係咧，頭先講到啊，還清咗之後咧，其實呢筆錢咧又會流存喺迪士尼公司做一個將來嘅誒資本開支或者係一個投入。咁想問清楚，其實當中呢個操作同埋呢個。

270
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,230
哦。

271
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,730
啊！多謝主席。

272
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:36,530
協議咧係誒睇住誒誒迪士尼嗰個誒營運啦、財務嗰個情況啦、盈利啦噉樣咧，喺適當嘅時候咧係轉換呢啲股本嘅。唔該，主席。好，跟住田田北辰議員。

273
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:24,420
機制係究竟係一個誒點樣嘅安排？噉啊，呢個第一個問題咧，關於貸款啦。咁第二咧，就關於其實啊，整體上嗰個財務結構啦。咁而家政府其實係呢個誒公司嘅大股東。咁但係咧，其實喺誒啊，除咗係大股東之外咧，其實當年起嘅時候咧，我哋仲有誒四十。

274
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:44,430
益嘅一個附屬股本，咁當時都有講咧，其實係可以啊，將來係會慢慢轉成普通股，同埋係可以出售嘅。而喺當年喺一九誒九九年誒初期啊，同埋喺二零零五年嘅時候咧，其實政府當時嘅方向都係話啊，喺適當時候其實係會出售政府持有嘅股份。咁想都想了解下，咁其實。

275
00:56:44,430 --> 00:57:04,440
誒政府而家仲係唔係呢個方向，同埋有冇計劃？其實即係或者係乜嘢嘅情況之下係會誒開始會誒即係慢慢由呢一個誒公司當中嘅股份去誒退出啦。噉啊，然後咧誒仲有時間噉啊誒第三樣嘢咧就宏觀少少啦，就誒其實頭先都聽到啊啊。

276
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:24,450
總裁嗰邊咧就講到喺個大灣區嘅嗰個客啊個客量咧係增長得比較強勁嘅。咁始終大灣區都係我哋好重要嘅一個腹地啦。咁咪都有同事都關注點樣去吸引多啲。咁啱啱其實喺琴日我哋誒鐵路事業小組咧都有講起，我哋紅水橋去前海都確定咗係會起一條新嘅跨境鐵路。

277
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:44,580
咁都誒，其實呢一條跨境鐵路咧係有一個南面嘅延伸段係已經規劃咗嘅。咁當中咧，其實正正就係會經過欣澳。咁所以咧，其實都希望我哋誒即係文體旅局啦，同埋迪士尼公司啦，都大家一齊去爭取推動，起碼將呢一段我哋起咗先，因為呢一段相對嚟講咧，全部都係隧道啊，施工嚟講咧都唔。

278
00:57:44,580 --> 00:58:04,590
啊，就比較簡單嘅。咁如果呢一段你諗下，如果由前海唔知去到洪水橋，直程可以嚟到恩路咧，咁呢個對於我哋去吸引大灣區嗰個客流啊、客量啊，配合埋深中通道，都係喺前海落點咧。咁呢一個交通上面嗰個誒基建配套咧，就會相當啊理想啦。就頭先阿姚議員講，我哋大漁山有世界級。

279
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:24,600
嘅機場啊，有世界級嘅景點啊，亦都有好方便嘅聯絡同我哋中環嘅核心區，但係同北部都會區同大灣區嘅交通聯絡咧，而家其實係一個短板嚟嘅。其實呢啲就係一個契機啦，其實應該係值得去推動嘅。噉啊，最後可能都知道有一個問題，可能比較複雜少少，都希望主席係可以容許誒會後做一個書面。

280
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:44,610
面嘅一個誒補充就係關於嗰個經濟回報率，睇翻當年咧，其實我哋嗰時誒預測嘅時候咧，就係開幕二十年咧個經濟回報率係去到二十四點七個percent。咁而家二十年過咗去啦，都想睇睇啦，其實誒實際嗰個表現同埋個數據係點樣，同埋我哋嗰啲係所講嘅額外消費啊或者增加值咧，其實嗰個。

281
00:58:44,610 --> 00:59:04,620
參數啊，模型啦，係咪同一九九九年係一樣？定話其實隨住嗰個誒時代嘅變化，其實都調整過嗰啲誒計算嘅參數。多謝主席。咪局長先係主席，我我得翻卅秒，我盡快誒嗰個頭先啊張議員最後嗰個題目咧，就誒我哋係需要即係用一個書面去答㗎啦誒。

282
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:24,630
剛才講過咧，誒嗰個幾時政府會出售我哋嘅股份，我諗誒我都講咗好多年，誒我哋嘅立場咧就係政府而家覺得咧迪士尼樂園咧，香港迪士尼樂園係我哋香港旅遊一個好主要嘅基建嚟嘅，咁因此咧政府保持個大股東嘅地位。

283
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:44,640
咧係重要嘅，特別現在咧，我哋喺新冠疫情之後，我哋走出咗疫情。誒，現在咧，希望係將個樂園咧去擴容，誒，係進一步吸引誒旅客，找住機遇嘅時候咧。事實上，我哋過往每一次有新嘅園區或者景點或者係擴建計劃咧，政府作為。

284
00:59:44,640 --> 01:00:04,650
大股東咧係可以係對於嗰個設計啦，或者係針對嘅客羣啦、內容啦，都係可以有一個主導性嘅去參與同埋投入。咁因此咧，我哋暫時咧係冇計劃咧係要改變政府作為香港迪士尼樂園度假區大股東呢一個嘅地位嘅。咁至於紅前。

285
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:24,660
鐵路嗰方面咧，當然如果係呢個鐵路去即係誒誒誒起嘅時候，我哋當然希望咧盡儘量可以同到喺誒迪士尼喺欣澳附近嘅即係地方咧有一個協同效應。呢個咧我哋都會去將我哋嘅一啲嘅睇法啦，同埋我哋嘅建議咧係投入。

286
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,460
佢又冇喎。

287
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,560
九億去到廿三億。

288
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,540
噉啊！我係寫個服字嘅。

289
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,790
其實都係體驗嘅啫，嗰啲唔係大嘢嚟嘅。

290
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,050
咁即係其實咧，佢好多開支係固定嘅。

291
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:16,480
但而beta咧就多咗一百五十個percent。

292
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,790
嗱，我理解咧，入場客嘅來源咧，呢個最緊要啦。

293
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,390
嗱，睇細數咧，佢總收入比去年咧只係多咗五成。

294
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:27,070
誒，嗰所以係一個好即係high margin、high fixed cost business。

295
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:05,190
二零一二一三一四加埋先得個六點八，佢今年一年可以破曬佢哋三年加埋。

296
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:51,390
嗱，呢樣嘢對本地嘅零售業界係好有啟發性。點解全港零售業額連跌十二個月？

297
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:59,990
去年十二月實施咗深圳一千六百萬人一簽多行，啱啱個二月仲係跌咗十四個percent。

298
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:43,130
本地客因為港人北上消費咧，竟然下跌咗三成，但係內地客又上升咗九成，海外客仲勁，上升咗一百四十個percent。

299
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:57,840
嗱，局長咧，我就曾經公開講過好多次。今日我要再贊下呢個迪士尼管理層同埋成個團隊嘅努力。佢今年賺八點四億，係開元以嚟嘅新高，但係比過去十四年只有三年賺錢。

300
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:44,670
去啊！運輸及物流局嗰個誒，畀佢哋參考同埋加入去紅線鐵鐵路嗰個計劃裏邊。誒，我請阿旅遊專員好簡單咁講一講嗰個貸款而一個情況啊，主席。誒，主席誒，主席誒，關於貸款嗰度咧，其實主要係迪士尼咧開第誒起第三間酒店嘅時候咧，係同政府有一筆貸款。

301
01:00:44,670 --> 01:01:04,680
嘅咁嗰度係大概係七億元噉，正如頭先所講啦，其實已經誒去到而家已經還咗六成噉。而家個計劃咧，亦都係喺今年咧係會誒誒全全部還翻畀誒政府噉，亦都所以咧係因為喺今年會還啦，咁所以咧就會由一個誒即係誒誒長期嘅貸款變成咗一個誒短期嘅喺嗰個財政個報告。

302
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:24,690
度噉樣樣去表述嘅，因為今年就已經會還啦。咁誒，另外就住股本嗰度咧，頭先啊局長誒都講咗啲啦。咁另外就係，亦都係根據翻迪士尼誒，根據翻嗰個誒合約嘅協議裏邊咧，其實咧就係喺二零一四年嘅時候咧，政府已經有四億嘅附屬股本咧，已經轉為咗普通股本㗎啦。噉我哋亦都會繼續跟住呢個。

303
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:21,930
噉啊，過去二十年，你都知我哋啲零售業啊，食老本啦，係咪根本就冇新意嘅？噉佢可以咁做咧，就係其實同嗰個魔雪奇緣都好有關係啦。我所聽講咧，魔雪奇緣全世界第一個喺呢度，係阿莫總自己發明嘅，好似當。

304
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:41,940
除咗其他區嗰啲咧，好似有啲反對聲噉，因為佢搶咗風頭。咁所以咧，其實一定要係持續唔使政府投資，佢內部資源，佢依家仲有地嘅，第一期仲有地嘅，去發展多啲嘅新嘅主題。嗱，佢正話講Marvel同埋Pixar咧。

305
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,350
其實。

306
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,460
主席。

307
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,780
大嘢咧就一定要有機動嘅遊戲。

308
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:45,590
另外嗰堆咧，你正常收錢，但係嗰日嘅額咧就限咗係咁多，因為唔想逼爆啊嘛。你可唔可以考慮下？

309
01:03:48,090 --> 01:04:01,370
咁依度個遊戲咧，你inside反轉女朋友，你諗反轉老朋友，你揸住架車行下又excitement，行行下又sadness，行行下又joy，都唔知幾多人玩。

310
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:36,610
你可唔可以考慮下？你平時禮拜日我諗大二萬零個人入啦，你攞一半嘅額出嚟啦，譬如萬五個啊，畀全香港淨係香港永久性居民抽籤就免費入場。

311
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:20,310
噉我想問下，你會唔會考慮一啲真係有規模，好似《魔雪奇緣》噉嘅嘢，又再係全世界第一個Disney去做嘅？好啦，最後咧揼你心口啦，二十週年紀念日就係九月十二號星期五，噉啊兩日後星期日九月十四號。

312
01:04:48,770 --> 01:05:08,780
誒多謝阿田議員一啲在商言商嘅建議嚇。誒我諗我或者噉樣講一講先。首先咧，誒迪士尼嗰個誒即係成功咧，我諗有好多方面啦。當然《魔雪奇緣》過去一年以嚟嗰個誒吸引力同埋佢對即係有一個新鮮嘅產品。

313
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:28,790
對於誒喺剛剛復甦嘅時候，大家好耐冇嚟過迪士尼樂園咧，係個吸引力非常之大嘅。咁呢個係第一點解會令到個業績咧，我哋相信係可以創到高峯，其中一個都係好關鍵嘅因素。咁而至於頭先嘅田議員提到個零售業咧，其實我據我掌握下，我冇許好。

314
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:48,800
即係確切嘅數字喺我手，我掌握嘅咧就係我哋而家話，我哋今年嘅二月嘅一個誒一個三位數字嘅跌幅咧，其實係同去年嘅二月去比較噉。首先，去年嘅二月咧係誒農歷新年啦，今年嘅二月咧已經再兩個月加埋都係跌誒。咁但係咧另一樣嘢咧就係大家。

315
01:05:48,800 --> 01:06:08,810
唔好忘記，二零零四年誒二零二四年嘅年頭咧，我哋當時大家見到一個報復式出遊嘅一個嘅誒出遊嘅情況。今年咧嗰個情況有些少唔同啦，同埋因為嗰個長假期嘅結構唔同，可能更加多人咧係去咗一個即係長嘅誒路線去出門噉樣。

316
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:28,820
咁呢個喺香港同埋喺內地咧都有呢個噉嘅狀況。但係其實如果我哋仔細睇一個數字咧，今年二月嗰個零售咧，其實係比我哋今年一月而我哋今年一月係有農歷年嘅，我哋都係有一個輕微嘅升幅㗎。今年二月比對今年一月嗰個零售咧，其實有一個輕微嘅升幅。我掌握可能係。

317
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:48,830
係百分之一啊，一點幾左右噉，所以咧，我哋睇數字嘅時候咧，都好小心咁去睇咧，有啲咩嘅啟示。誒頭先講到誒Marvel嗰度咧，就想同阿田議員解釋一下Marvel咧係我哋一個好大嘅一個新園區，裏邊一定有刺激機動遊戲。而事實上咧，呢一個園區唔。

318
01:06:48,830 --> 01:07:08,840
只一個刺激機動遊戲㩒，仲會有其他嘅配套嘅遊樂設施。佢係好似啊Frozen噉樣，魔雪奇緣噉樣，係一個園區嚟啊。而當年嘅魔雪奇緣咧，亦都係我哋去考察咗喺啊美國佛羅裏達州嘅魔雪奇緣嘅嗰一個園區之後咧，我哋就發覺我哋喺香港咧必

319
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:28,850
需要做一個更大更好，咁現在咧亦都感謝即係香港迪士尼嘅誒同仁嘅努力，我哋真係做到一個更大更好、更加有吸引力。咁所以喺即係今次我哋呢一個漫威Marvel嘅園區裏面咧，我亦都可以向大家誒保證，我哋咧係希望會做一個大嘅、好嘅、巨級。

320
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:48,860
人力嘅園區咁至於誒，我哋去到今年嘅慶祝嘅時候，迪士尼樂園二十週年生日嘅時候，我哋有啲乜嘢嘅回饋畀香港市民咧？就我諗容許我哋咧有多一啲嘅時間去考慮。田議員剛才嘅你呢個嘅建議咧，我哋係聽到嘅，我哋去考慮一下。多謝主席，多謝局長。誒誒。

321
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:07,330
誒。

322
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:39,010
嗯，夠鐘啦嚇！我請下一位嚴剛副主席嚇。

323
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:46,080
好誒，多謝主席。首先咧，都要恭喜Disney咧，舊年取得良好嘅業績。

324
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:34,370
咁而喺香港嚟講咧，雖然我哋都以中文係為多，但係咧我哋嘅英文亦都係相當突出。噉就希望咧能夠以兩文三語咧係對外國嘅旅客咧，亦都成為一個更大嘅吸引。

325
01:10:46,890 --> 01:11:01,330
咁但係在於政府嚟講咧，我哋係要求香港迪士尼咧係有我哋自己本地嘅一個好大嘅特色，同埋咧係有我哋自己本地不能去其他地方即係重複嘅一個體驗。咁而誒。

326
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:25,910
我哋喺比較上面有啲咩即係優勢咧？因為誒呢個即係我諗都睇到反映一啲就係，例如我哋同上海嘅嗰個比，可以睇到係即係中國嗰個誒消費者嘅嗰個market啦，而即係東京個比較可能就係成個亞洲嘅market一個情況噉樣。咁誒呢幾個問題唔該主席。

327
01:07:48,860 --> 01:08:08,870
夠，而家下一位李浩然議員。誒，多謝主席。咁首先咧，就即係好樂見，即係亦都欣喜，即係今年嘅業誒業績咧係做得即係相當好啦。咁噉啊，我首先有誒第一個問題啊，就係關於成本。雖然政管好似頭先亞田議員都提到咧，睇翻EBITDA咧，其實即係似乎個成本就唔係好變化好大。

328
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:28,880
但係都想誒，因為喺個文件材料裏邊咧就冇比較仔細，都想了解多啲咧，就係關於個成本方面有冇啲咩嘅變化噉樣。咁呢個係第一啦。第二咧，我係跟進翻頭先咧都有同事問到嘅，就係誒我哋即係關於嗰啲annual pass咧有幾多係即係非本地嘅即係持有嘅。

329
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:48,890
誒噉樣，咁以及咧同一個呢個相關咧，就係即係喺個園區裏邊咧，嗰個誒首次入場同埋一啲嘅回頭客嗰個比例大概係點樣？而回頭客佢大概即係平均係幾多次嘅次數噉樣？有冇一啲嘅統計？咁因為呢個咧都可以睇到，即係個即係誒遊客嗰個即係組成。

330
01:08:48,890 --> 01:09:08,900
啦咁特別係一啲未未必係本地嘅客嘅一個結構噉樣噉。最後咧就誒有另一個問題咧，就係話誒。當然頭先局長都講到啦，我哋嘅呢個園區係比較即係五臟俱全啦。咁但係即係我哋周邊都有啲好誒同質化競爭嘅誒，包括例如上海，亦都包括例如東京嘅同一誒樂園啦。

331
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:46,860
誒主席，或者我答一答第三個問題，然之後頭一二個問題關於成本同埋誒嗰個誒年票嗰個情況，我請阿莫先生去解答。誒冇錯嘅，我哋喺亞洲區咧都有兩個，其實嚴格嚟講係三個添，因為東京有兩個迪士尼樂園，咁然之後咧就上海有一個誒香港。

332
01:09:46,860 --> 01:10:06,870
講嗰個好處喺邊度，或者我哋嗰個競爭嘅優勢喺邊度咧？首先，除咗係話佢係好適合一家大細咧，一整天咧可以玩到最多嘢之外，亦都唔行得太辛苦，唔唔會好即係好好大好遠之外咧。另一樣嘢好誒明顯嘅咧，就係我哋希望喺我哋香港樂園嘅園區裏面咧，觀

333
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:26,880
住一啲香港嘅特色，大家如果去玩嗰個鐵甲奇俠嗰個誒啊機動遊戲嘅時候咧，你會見到其實嗰個背景咧係香港嚟嘅。將來嘅漫威咧，其實我哋新嘅景區咧，我哋都會進駐有呢個元素，令到咧大家係覺得咧呢一個噉嘅遊樂設施咧，必然係香香港先有，所以。

334
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,600
My Mr Moriarty.

335
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,210
啊！吸引更多嘅校園，多謝主席。

336
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,250
Thank you. As it relates to our local attendance.

337
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,430
誒現時咧係得嗰個好似係金級先有噉樣嘅優惠嘅嚇。

338
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:36,930
一方面咧可以優惠咗港人啦，一方面咧港人咧可以多啲帶啲家人咧可以入園啊嘛，呢個係提升向誒港人咧嗰個誒發客嘅嗰個人數。

339
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:58,190
And it is what it sounds like. It's two tickets for the price of of one, and that's going to be extended from now through the month of July.

340
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:39,150
嗰個先進嘅優勢係咪係Disney嘅個街頭個表演咧，可以推出嗰個誒機器人嘅誒嗰個表演嘅嗰個依依卡同遊客可以互動嘅嗰個節目，噉樣保持一啲新鮮感同埋神秘感。

341
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:46,860
Time show, but as you mentioned, also the promotional aspects as well. So for our Magic Access guests, there are a lot of benefits, including birthday benefits. Right now, we actually have an offer for just Hong Kong locals called Double the Fun.

342
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:46,890
咧，我哋要嚟香港嘅迪士尼樂園。咁嗱，另外一樣嘢咧，亦都係誒，我哋喺即係我哋自己嘅，譬如話受歡迎嘅產品嗰度啊，譬如我哋而家喺香港有比較受歡迎嘅一啲誒誒Duffy同佢嘅朋友嘅產品，我哋就會喺呢度咧多做功夫。咁呢個亦都可以請阿莫先生咧去講得多。

343
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:21,690
我哋亦都係咧，誒喺即係我哋嘅誒國際化上面咧，亦都係希望係做得好，因為咧香港嘅迪士尼樂園咧，我哋係兩文三語嗰度咧係相當突出嘅喺亞洲嘅誒樂園嚟講。因為日本主要係日日語啦，喺內地嚟講喺上海嚟講，主要就係中文啦。

344
01:11:46,360 --> 01:12:06,370
誒咁咧都睇到咧Disney嘅報告咧誒，舊年取得咁好業績嘅同時咧，我睇到本地嘅遊客咧嗰個人數係下降嘅，下降咗百分之二十五。所以咧唔知道誒啱啱有冇議員提提問過咁咧係咩原因啊？嚇咁咧誒，我諗住咧誒，如果係綁誒，本住咧。

345
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:27,620
香港嘅園區咧，服務多啲香港人嘅嗰個宗旨咧，可唔可以考慮一下？即係咧，好似誒海洋海洋公園噉樣咁咧，香港港人咧深入嗰一日咧，可以咧畀深入嘅港人咧誒，可以畀半價，甚至係畀免費嘅嗰個門票咁咧一。

346
01:12:43,490 --> 01:13:03,500
咁咧，另外一個咧，誒啱啱浩然議員咧都提及過。咁咧，誒香港嘅Disney咧，誒未來潛在嘅誒最大潛力最大嘅遊客羣咧，應該係亞洲客嘅，所以咧誒特別咧係東南亞同埋內地嘅。咁咧，預點可以避免咧？誒啱啱講。

347
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:23,510
講嘅同質化嘅競爭，同嗰個上海同埋東京Disney同質化競爭咁咧。誒，陽區咧，舊年推出嚟嘅誒《魔術奇緣》咧係非常之好啊，反應非常之好。咁咧，今年咧有冇更多嘅嗰個創新嘅項目？譬如話咧，利用好咁喺依家誒，我哋內地嗰個機機械人嘅嗰。

348
01:13:49,790 --> 01:14:09,800
In two thousand and twenty four, our local attendance actually it did decline from two thousand and twenty three. But I think we have to remember that in absolute terms, two thousand and twenty three was a record year for us with local attendance, largely as a result of still being impacted by the effects of.

349
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:29,810
COVID-19。That being said, I think it's probably important to note that our attendance in 2024 for local guests is still well above 2018 levels, so pre-COVID levels. And I think a lot of that has to do with the improvements that we've made to the resort, including the Castle of Magical Dreams, the night.

350
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:18,740
So, we're excited about about that. I think as it relates to the overall mix, I think that as we move forward, we're going to continue to look at a mix of balance mix between local, mainland and inbound international guests. Roughly one third one.

351
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,030
哦。

352
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:05,630
nearby Hong Kong Disneyland, yes, we can look into that. Thank you.

353
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:16,350
旅遊業發展藍圖二點零咧，就提到深化大嶼山旅遊資源。

354
01:18:51,080 --> 01:19:01,560
係誒嗰個協同，我相信係大嘅。誒至於另外一啲咧，我就睇睇啊誒關於二十週年嗰度，睇下莫生嗰個補充。Mr. Moriarty。

355
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:09,470
That are really well represented as to our uniqueness and differentiation in the market. We have unique attractions, unique to Hong Kong attractions as well.

356
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:50,180
我我唔知你用過未嚇，即係可用嘅碼頭嚇，㗎會點樣去配合咧？啊，例如交通配套啊、周邊景點協同效應等等，有冇一個具體嘅規劃咧？多謝主席。

357
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:38,750
一third，一third。Of course，that will change over over time，but that's what we're targeting right now。And it's really the differentiation that we have to your questions about the uniqueness of our attractions。In addition to World of Frozen，we have the largest Marvel hub in all of the Asia parks。We're opening up a brand new unique

358
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:58,760
The largest that we've ever had here, and of course our nighttime show is unique to us as well. In addition to a number of other attractions, including Mystic Manor, which is only at Hong Kong Disneyland, Grizzly Gulch as well. So I think in addition to those things that the secretary mentioned earlier, that

359
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:30,430
嚇，林建豐議員都係主席局長，你腳頭非常之好。啊，阿Michael Marriot，你個腳頭都唔錯。咁咧就我好高興咧啊，見到香港迪士尼響舊年咧個表現係相當亮眼嘅。不過啊，我有幾點咧想問一問。

360
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:50,440
誒香港迪士尼嘅局長同埋香港迪士尼嘅，咁有可能有部分咧，之前誒啲同事都都問過嘅。咁第一咧就誒迪士尼開幕二十週年就會推出呢個Fantastic巡遊同埋全新城堡表演等嘅活動啦，仲計劃興建新嘅樂園。噉我。

361
01:16:50,440 --> 01:17:10,450
我就想問一問咧，依個擴建同慶祝活動預計係會帶嚟幾多額外嘅旅客？個分佈係會點樣樣咧？政府同迪士尼有冇具體目標KPI，尤其係大灣區同埋海外嘅市場，會唔會有一啲誒針對性嘅推廣咧？咁誒，第二咧就係政府嘅旅。

362
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:36,640
南大魚擁有獨天獨厚嘅自然環境，噉啊，完全係可以咧成為一個世界級嘅海洋生態旅遊區啊！就好似法國南部噉樣，嗱，完全係可以發展island誒依個island hopping。咁迪士尼咧啊，作為一個重點，亦都有個。

363
01:17:51,050 --> 01:18:11,060
啊，局長誒，主席，剛才我哋其實比較詳細咁講咗嗰個南南大魚海島遊嘅林議員。不過有少少時間，我諗我呃要講多一次誒。其實咧，我哋喺南大魚嚟講，或者喺大魚山作為一個海島遊咧，目前係一個好嘅契機。我哋有機場嘅誒SkyCity啦，我哋有誒。

364
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:31,070
嗯，粵車南下將會係會有好多車可以經大嶼山嗰邊嚟到香港啦。另外咧，我哋嘅亞博二期咧，亦都係會興建啦。咁會有一個誒好大嘅新嘅一個表演場所。咁同埋咧，其實發展局亦都係就住頭先阿林議員講嘅，誒喺大嶼南嗰度咧興建。

365
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:51,080
一個即係誒度假區或者係度假嘅酒店嗰度咧，係邀請商界提供意向書。我亦都咧係好密切咁關注住咧，睇下有啲咩好嘅建議嘅。咁相信咧個協同效應係誒同迪士尼嚟講，因為我哋亦都有新嘅園區嘅發展，同埋有誒新嘅誒自資嘅項目，咁所以咧係。

366
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,290
嗯。

367
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:16,860
啊！

368
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,400
等佢坐定先嚇。

369
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:45,060
噉啊，先請誒。

370
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,400
噉我哋進入議程嘅嚇。

371
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,750
噉我哋請誒官員進入會議室。

372
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:37,310
噉啊！我歡迎政府當局嘅代表出席會議。

373
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:45,520
噉我哋完成討論呢個項目啦，噉啊啊多謝局長。

374
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:23,150
噉啊！有意發言嘅委員可以誒禁制誒要求發言啦。

375
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:12,420
最後第五項啦，噉就空運危險品嘅法例修訂建議嚇。

376
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:39,410
劈曬一個啦，其實就係用盈利自己嗰啲盈利，我哋儲翻翻嚟咧，就我哋自資去投資落呢一啲嘅誒新嘅誒設施嗰度，而唔需要係向誒立法會申請嗰個注資嘅嚇噉樣。唔該，主席。

377
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:59,900
Thank you, Secretary Law and Mr Moriuchi. It remains for me to congratulate Disney Hong Kong on the twenty-th anniversary, and for your stellar performance. I'm sure you go from strength to strength. Thank you.

378
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:21,850
Madam Chair, so as a release for our twenty-th anniversary, we we do not talk necessarily about the commercial terms or expectations of what's going on. But yes, we have those KPIs in place. What I can say is that we are planning on leveraging everyone in our Disney fan base right now. Those who have come before.

379
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:41,860
as well as working with the Walt Disney Company and larger platforms like Disney Plus throughout the region to invite first-timers to Hong Kong and to Hong Kong Disneyland. We're going to do this through a very targeted marketing campaign in all of our key markets throughout Southeast Asia, North Asia, and of course.

380
01:19:41,860 --> 01:20:01,870
And in mainland China, in addition to those marketing campaigns, we'll have targeted promotions by channel and by by country to attract people to Hong Kong throughout different parts of the year. With respect to the Lantau Island work, especially the pier.

381
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:26,130
好啦，誒，跟住咧就張欣宇議員第二輪三分鐘嚇。啊，好，多謝主席。其實我好快追翻頭先一個技術問題啫，因為啱啱啊，即係啊啊專員講到，即係嗰個貸款係一個為咗酒店嗰度嘅七億貸款。噉我我想誒誒瞭解少少就係，因為我哋誒起呢個迪士尼嘅時候初期其實政府係。

382
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:46,140
係有一個六十一億嘅貸款係借咗畀呢個公司嘅，咁嗰度係咪其實已經還曬㗎啦？係咪一個誒噉嘅情況咁？同埋頭先問咗個機制，就係誒，即係其實佢還咗嘅還咗政府嘅貸款咧，因為頭先聽到話流傳喺間公司入邊去做進一步嘅資本開支，想想問想想了解下呢個呢個機制其實係點樣運作嘅？

383
01:20:46,140 --> 01:21:06,150
多謝主席，局長。誒，專員，哦，專員得誒誒。主席頭先誒講過，而家咧，而家嘅貸款咧，其實淨係淨翻誒大約係誒二億幾三億嗰個頭先講過嘅，即係因為嗰個酒店嗰度係借咗七億嘅，同政府咁而家還咗三分之二度嚟緊，嗰啲就係會喺今年還曬啦噉嘅樣噉。

384
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:26,160
噉你頭先提過就係喺早期嘅時候有一啲係注資啦，或者係貸款啦。咁嗰啲其實已經完全全部清還，而家係剩翻係第三個酒店呢一個嘅嘅貸款嘅啫。咁誒第二個問題咧係關於嗰個誒自資嘅，就係誒有一啲誒迪士尼嘅誒誒設施啦。其實嚟緊亦都有新嘅，例如。

385
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
喂，姐。

386
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,820
依然固體。

387
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,580
政府嘅代表咧，係介紹下個文件同。

388
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:35,240
以就住兩套嘅附屬法例作出相應嘅技術性修訂。

389
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:00,950
根據國際民航組織發出危險品安全空運技術指令。

390
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:54,340
好，唔該，副司長、副秘書長，跟住我會介紹今次空運危險品法例修訂嘅建議。

391
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:08,810
簡稱技術指令。就空運而言，危險品包括爆炸品、壓縮氣體、易燃液體。

392
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:46,030
充電寶咧係放喺行李架上邊，噉就似咧民航處咧就一直同航空公司係誒緊密咁聯係嘅，咁或者而家我交畀魏主任講解一下誒國際民航組織相關嘅修訂。

393
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:54,300
國際民航組織每兩年會更新同埋公佈一次危險品安全空運技術指令，噉我哋咧就係簡稱技術指令，噉係會詳細列出空運危險品包括佢嘅分類啦、包裝、標籤同埋誒裝載上機等等嘅各項要求嘅。

394
01:22:50,590 --> 01:23:10,600
好多謝主席。係啊，洪洪思敏女士，運輸局嘅副秘書長。我哋有民航處嘅助理處長吳毅先生，民航處高級航空安全事務主任韋少芬先生，阿洪副秘書長。好多謝主席。誒咁多位。

395
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:30,610
議員好，噉我嚟一個簡單嘅簡介，然之後我哋咧稍後都係有一個誒好簡短嘅PowerPoint嘅。咁今次嘅會議嘅議題咧，就係為咗配合國際民用航空組織，即係簡稱誒Icao啦，國際民航組織最新公佈有關危險品空運安全嘅標準。咁政府咧係見。

396
01:23:54,580 --> 01:24:14,590
咁喺二零二五年一月一號起，最新嘅技術指令咧已經係納入咗誒國際誒航空協會IATA佢嗰個嘅危險品規例。咁所以咧，國際航空界咧而家已經係按住個技術指令最新嘅規定去處理呢個運輸危險品嘅安排嘅。咁

397
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:34,600
所以今次嘅修例建議咧，我哋係旨在將技術指令嘅規定正式納入本地嘅法例，以確保咧我哋香港嗰個規管制度咧係緊貼國際嘅標準。咁具體而言咧，誒誒睇下議員視乎議員嘅意見啦。咁政府咧係建議咧就將最新版本嘅技術指令咧就係誒修訂落。

398
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:54,610
去危險品航空託運安全規例，即係第三百四A章，以及係航空危險品規例係第四四八C章嘅附表十六。咁因誒接下落嚟咧，民航處嘅同事咧係會講解成個修訂嗰個嘅建議。咁另外咧，最後我都想藉此機會咧向委員。

399
01:24:54,610 --> 01:25:14,620
説明咧，政府喺誒對危險品嘅其他嘅監控措施啦。咁除咗頭先講嘅國際民航組織嘅相關規定之外咧，喺有需要嘅時候，民航處亦都會對本地航空公司咧係作出額外嘅要求嘅。咁正正如就係近期多宗有關飛機乘客攜帶同埋使用鋰電池。

400
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,520
第一條危險品。

401
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:33,160
列出咗空運危險品嘅規定。

402
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,040
氧化物質、有毒物質。

403
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,310
規管咗貨運人同埋貨運代理人。

404
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:01,960
航空託運安全規例第三百四A章。

405
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:44,740
而最新嘅技術指令已於二零二四年九月發布。

406
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:27,420
規管飛機和機場營運機構對危險品嘅操作安排。

407
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:49,600
法例修訂重點包括更新技術指令嘅定義。

408
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:19,680
感染性物質、放射性物質同埋一啲腐蝕性嘅物質等等。

409
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:56,290
以2025、2026年版取代2023、2024年版嘅提述。

410
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:39,940
詳細規定亦都羅列於國際民航組織每兩年更新一次嘅技術指令裏邊。

411
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:12,040
喺提供危險品，以於空運前必須妥為處理危險品嘅規定。

412
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:54,820
技術指令嘅規定藉住兩套本地附屬法例而喺香港具有法律效力。

413
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:30,510
為咗確保航空安全，國際民航組織制定《國際民用航空公約》附件十八。

414
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:21,720
第二條係航空危險品規例，即一九九五年飛航香港令第四四八C章附表十六。

415
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:40,520
而法例修訂嘅目的係確保香港嘅空運危險品規管制度可以緊貼國際民航組織標準，保障航空安全。

416
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:34,700
嘅外置充電器，即係我哋所講嘅充電寶有關嘅安全事宜，民航處已經向本地嘅航空公司發出通告，就係由誒本年嘅四月七號起，乘客咧就不得喺航班上咧就係使用充電寶為佢哋嘅電子裝置充電，或者為充電寶充電，以及咧就唔可以將

417
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,430
文件要求。

418
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,500
在本港具有法律效力。

419
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,700
亦都設立咗查詢電話。

420
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,570
另外，更改特殊規定。

421
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,390
喺危險品運輸文件上邊。

422
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,290
使到技術指令嘅最新規定。

423
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,020
而其中有以下嘅例子。

424
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,230
致函持份者，説明修訂嘅詳情。

425
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,170
亦都透過講座向航空貨運業界簡介有關事宜。

426
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:13,020
一個指明含有鋰興電池嘅裝置嘅特殊規定。

427
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:33,990
需要為每個含有某一啲放射性物質嘅包裝件列明尺寸。

428
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:31,930
而發布技術指令嘅新規定就包括咗上載於民航處嘅網站。

429
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:03,760
其他嘅修訂例子亦都包括更新咗標記名稱，將鋰電池標記更名為電池標記。

430
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:22,340
加入咗條件，就可以令到小型裝置，例如手錶或者温度記錄儀，可處於未關閉嘅狀態下運輸。

431
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:17,730
另外，新嘅技術指令主要修改咗空運危險品一啲技術規定，包括咗某啲危險品嘅分類標準、包裝要求、標記同埋標籤嘅要求。

432
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:51,260
允許乘客攜帶嘅危險品喺新版嘅技術指令裏邊，一個有關允許乘客攜帶危險品嘅注釋被遷移，以便更合適地反映出其適用性。

433
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,230
小心。

434
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,330
多謝阿代主席。

435
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:33,100
並隨即生效。

436
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,380
好，誒，先生，我依下先。

437
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:14,440
第一個就係誒，我注意到係。

438
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:11,370
噉我就借呢機會想問問局方處方咧兩條問題啫。

439
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:58,010
呢個規規例係全球業界認可嘅空運危險品參考標準。

440
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:54,340
誒，而且公佈咗誒有關危險品空運安全嘅最新標準。

441
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:48,170
國際民用航空組織就喺舊年九月嘅時候已經修訂咗佢一個技術指令。

442
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:31,190
至於修訂嘅時間表，我哋嘅目標係經修訂嘅法例可以喺二零二五年七月完成立法程序。

443
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:19,560
而所有代表對通過修訂兩套本地附屬法例實施最新規定嘅建議，都沒有異議。

444
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:52,180
另外，技術指令嘅最新修訂內容，亦都喺國際航空運輸協會出版嘅危險品規例公佈。

445
01:31:54,900 --> 01:32:05,470
咁特區政府就建議修訂本港嘅法例咧，以就香港實施有關嘅標準咧，呢個係屬於技術嘅修訂咧，我係支持嘅。

446
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:11,660
至於業界諮詢，民航處亦於二零二四年十一月諮詢咗代表貨運人、貨運代理人同埋航空公司嘅協會同機構。

447
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:37,230
好，依家係委員提問嘅時間咧。依家暫時咧係有兩位議員，誒，係陳陳志宏議員同埋誒本人有有問題。咁咧，延時十五分鐘時間，誒，你問你答，應該五分鐘。

448
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:54,860
唔該，嗯誒，我哋今日個會議係應該六點十五分結束嘅，但因為可能未必準時完成啦，咁各位同唔同意延長十五分鐘嚇？多謝咁咧，因為本人要出席一個典禮啊，噉啊，麻煩嚴江副主席代主持嚇，多謝你。

449
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,100
第六段嗰度。

450
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,030
就係喺航班上。

451
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,960
如頭先誒，處方都解釋咗一下。

452
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:46,030
第二點就係誒，有注意到誒。

453
01:33:57,110 --> 01:34:01,980
佢呢個技術指令更新咗之後咧，有一句嘢，因為佢係英文嘅，佢冇中文。

454
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:07,850
誒，我見到喺文龍處都冇中文嘅翻譯嘅，噉我説讀出嚟就話addition of a requirement。

455
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:28,090
噉啊！阿副秘書長又提過，就係關於一般嘅乘客會感到困擾嘅嘢。

456
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:56,830
國際民航誒組織咧，其實佢出嗰個技術指引咧，佢有一個叫誒附表八hyphen一一E嗰度。

457
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:25,920
咁但係係咪切實可行咧？噉我就收到不少嘅市民大眾，佢係即係做飛機乘客嘅時候，佢都唔知點樣處理好，唔擺上行李架上。

458
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:15,110
好啦，但問題就係呢一個規定，當然民防處出咗四月七號出咗個指引，有一個指令就就四月七號開始就唔可以誒做呢啲動作。

459
01:32:49,290 --> 01:33:02,560
喺個航班嘅過程之中充電使用，或者就唔畀佢擺上去行李架嘅。咁呢個理解，因為頭先都即係主方都介紹過，係的而且確出過一啲航班上嘅一啲意外。

460
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:41,280
誒唔可以用明白，但係點樣即係保管住嗰個誒充電寶咧？咁噉，除非佢要帶個袋去，或者係袋喺自己嘅衫袋噉。咁其實係咪都都唔安全咧？咁呢個一點。

461
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:48,550
就就算誒民航處冇出呢一個指引到啦，咁其實有個別嘅航空公司都做咗嘅，就係禁止佢哋誒將佢哋攜帶咗上機嘅所謂誒充電器或者叫做俗稱尿袋嗰啲咧，就誒。

462
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:28,140
for devices containing lithium batteries carried in the cabin to be protected from damage and inadvertent activation。嘅意思即係新增要求，就係任何載有鋰電池、鋰電池嘅元件喺航班上，你要確保不受損壞或者及不慎。

463
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:48,150
地啟動噉，咁唔唔係太明佢嗰啲意思係咪即係我哋要帶一啲保護嘅裝置去保護住嗰個充電寶咧？咁究竟如果執行嘅時候係點樣可以切實可行去去執行咧？咁同樣地喺個table八一即係有個有個附表八一嘅一e咧。

464
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:03,960
噉。

465
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:57,980
助理處長，助理處長係。

466
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,100
係誒，唔該曬，主席。

467
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:37,620
好誒，第一個問題係嘛？另外有一個問題，有個亞特嗰度嗰個係係點樣計算啊？

468
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:31,180
咁誒大誒，亦都係唔可以用誒，或者係為佢哋插電嘅。咁呢個大家應該都誒都聽過啦。咁誒。

469
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:40,030
種可能會造造成一啲困擾嘅啫。如果加入一啲誒最佳做做法嘅話咧，如果畀啲市民帶入去參觀，我覺得係好。

470
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:30,680
反對嘅情況之下咧，基本上誒個乘客都可以攜帶嘅。咁如果我哋冇一個特定嘅要求啊，用某一種袋啊或者某一種嘅嘅東西去裝住佢嘅嚇。

471
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:35,700
買得到，咁咧第二個問題啊，主席，我想問埋咧就係喺其他修訂嗰度，即係第十段咧，頭先都係大致介紹過，就話佢其中一個誒修訂係將鋰電池標記。

472
01:34:48,150 --> 01:35:02,630
佢就誒請要求咗，就係話：如果假如係乘客或者係誒航班嘅嗰個誒服務員，佢上飛機嘅時候，佢可以帶嘅一啲誒active devices啊。

473
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:22,920
就誒，如果佢係有一啲你嘅電池啊，等等，佢嗰個瓦特hour即係嗰個亞特嗰個咧，佢佢係係應用喺唔係個別嘅電池，係成個元件噉。噉我就唔係太明，因為我拆唔到嗰個原原來個table，因為要畀錢先至可以。

474
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:55,990
更名為電池標記，誒，我又唔係太明咧，因為冇個細節啦。佢係咪任何電池，就算唔係鋰電池，都要納入相關嘅規定咧？咁咁點解佢會即係有噉嘅改動咧？兩個問題，唔該。好兩個問題，噉你誒吳處長誒請啊。

475
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:22,860
噉啊，多謝議員嘅提問啦。咁誒，首先咧，我就先講一講喺航班上個情況啦。咁誒，因為由於我哋係希望即係保障乘客誒航空嘅安全啦，咁所以其實都係實施咗個新嘅最新嘅要求。噉就係話呢一啲嘅充電寶咧，就係誒誒唔可以放上行李架上面咧。

476
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:51,470
喺呢一個嘅情況之下咧，其實誒我哋都都瞭解啊，乘客話誒噉，我哋放喺邊啊噉樣。我哋建議呢一個咧，可以向翻即係航空公司去查詢，因為其實唔同嘅航空公司航班上面嘅設備啊、誒配備都係唔一樣嘅。咁呢一方面，我希望可以解答到呢個問題。即係意思，我哋誒要承擔某一個航

477
01:36:51,470 --> 01:37:11,480
航班嘅時候就未去搭飛機，或者我check in嘅時候就同佢問一問佢。但係我試過情況都係佢佢都搭唔到你嘅喎，因為總之你就唔可以擺上行李架啦噉。咁其實有冇一啲即係未必係民航處做嘅嘢啦，但係有冇一啲譬如政府可以提供一啲建議啊？譬如係咪揾一個即係買買個袋個。

478
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:31,490
袋係誒點樣嘅尺寸，或者可以裝到啲上去咧？咁如果唔係嘅話，就坊間嘅可能就求其買個袋噉。但係咧，通常如果係有一件物件嘅話，嗰個空中嘅服務員佢係唔畀你就咁擺噉，可能要係擺個誒墩底嘅噉樣樣。咁所以凡之總。

479
01:37:41,300 --> 01:38:01,310
誒主席，我嘗試回答呢個問題。咁誒呢個係明白嘅。咁咧就誒，或者我講一般個情況啦。一般嚟講咧，咁誒我哋作為飛機乘客咧，噉就係話誒呢個誒機組人員都會要求將呢一啲自己隨身嘅物品咧，就係放喺行李架或者放喺誒呢個。

480
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:21,320
前邊嗰張凳嘅下邊嗰個位置啦，咁誒有啲好細件嘅，可能佢亦都會讓你即係袋喺袋啊等等。咁由於呢一啲咧，其實可能都牽涉咗啲個人嘅選擇啦。噉我哋只係話即係喺個規定上面咧，由於安全理由就唔可以放喺個行李架上面。咁而其他嘅選項咧，其實就即係如果係個機組人員即係唔。

481
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,980
好，係一位議員，誒，要批兩頁。

482
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:10,230
個一百瓦時嘅嘅誒充電裝置嘅。

483
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:25,780
或者每一個充電寶，如果一萬瓦特、一萬個誒M W嘅話，佢可以帶幾多部？有冇呢個指引嘅，請問？

484
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:56,020
清楚知道一個噉嘅規定，咁令到嗰個航空嘅安全能夠得到保障。咁呢個我係誒有個噉嘅少少嘅意見咧。多謝主席。

485
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:42,030
咁所以咧，其實就將呢一個標記改做一個比較即係通用啲嘅誒嘅嘅名稱啦。噉就係電池標記，噉就係包括埋呢一個誒鈉同埋鋰電池啦。

486
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:26,890
個即係溝通瞭解啊，咁呢度都想即係瞭解翻少少詳情，即係航空公司有冇咩有冇咩嘅誒誒顧慮啊，或者有咩嘅意見咧？咁但係就同頭先阿陳兆雄議員想問嘅嗰個問題咧，我都有少少嘅一啲嘅誒誒意見嘅，其實就。

487
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:59,060
誒呢一個亞特方面咧，其實就可能喺個我哋可以嘗試揾翻誒民航處。我哋有一個嘅網頁上面咧，就係關於誒誒乘客同埋機組人員可以攜帶嘅危險物品。咁嗰度咧，其實我哋都有提供咗一個方法咧，可以係計出嚟嘅。即係譬如你有個知道嗰個footage個。

488
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:19,070
伏特啦，噉你知道佢個誒個電流啦，咁其實可以計到條數出嚟嘅。咁如果係有需要嘅話咧，可以聯絡我哋民航處咧，我哋都我哋同事都可以幫手解答呢個問題。係啊，朱姐，你如果唔介意，我就想追問呢個問題。我我都收到好多好多嘅即係查問，就係究竟一個人一個乘客可以帶幾多部充電寶？

489
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:46,420
現時咧，根據呢一個技術指令嚟講咧，咁誒可以攜帶上去誒飛機嘅話咧，就只係限每一件咧係一百個瓦特hour留下先至可以誒攜帶嘅。咁呢一個係國際民航組織嘅要求嚟嘅。一件誒，但係咧嗱誒，呢一個國際民航組織要求就係每一件。

490
01:39:46,420 --> 01:40:06,430
每一件乘客攜帶上去嘅呢一個嘅備用充電嘅誒裝置咧，就不能夠超過一百個瓦時。咁而誒數目方面嘅話咧，就係如果係根據呢一個國際運輸協會IATA咧，佢哋就有額外另外規定，佢哋咧就會話每個乘客最多係二十件。呢一啲不超過。

491
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:30,710
好，另另外一個就係個陳議員咧，誒時間咧真係有限㗎，你咪畀頭先頭先佢未答過嗰個電個 lithium 誒個鋰電池標記一個，可以簡單簡單回覆啊，好簡單回覆啊。咁呢一個嘅標記嘅話咧，其實就係話因為國際民航組織留意到咧，除咗而家鋰電池之外咧，另外仲有納電池 sodium。

492
01:40:47,770 --> 01:41:07,780
誒都係，代主席誒，本嚟就冇諗住按冇諗住問嘅，不過頭先啊副處長啊副處長嗰個回覆咧，我就變咗我都都要問一問，因為頭先喺呢個介紹裏邊咧就誒係話十一月係咪有去同啲航空公司有做一個做一個。

493
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:47,180
誒保障航空安全呢個，我都相信每一個每一個飛機嘅乘客，大家都係應該有呢有呢份責任噉啊。但係最重要就係話你呢個誒呢度嘅呢個技術性嘅修訂，呢個法例嘅修訂，我哋肯定係會支持嘅。問題就係點樣要有一個清晰嘅指引畀到乘客，等我哋清楚掌握。

494
01:41:47,180 --> 01:42:07,190
可以點做，唔可以點做，呢個好重要嘅。譬如咁頭先嗱，你講到明就話誒，唔可以擺上行李架上邊啦。但係其實就譬如噉，好似如果即係嘅意思，即係話你係要更新嚇，你要更新，噉你一係袋喺佢自己衫袋度，一係咧擺喺自己即係緊即係隨身攜帶。

495
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:27,200
大嘅一個小袋、小包，或者擺落去擺落去墊底，呢個係一個即係大家容易理解嘅做法啦。咁但係譬如講，如果我有啲有啲時候，譬如講你你件西裝擺喺個袋度，跟住咧你幫即係有啲飛機乘務員將個西裝啊幫你掛翻去佢個衣架、佢個衣櫃嗰度，咁嗰啲呢啲得唔得咧？咁即係我諗呢啲我都需要一啲嘅。

496
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,870
公司溝通咗咧，都係可以讓讓佢帶上去飛機嘅呢啲。

497
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:22,880
上就冇特別嘅要求啦。咁咁呢個應該相對話，如果關於存放咧，相信係應該清晰嘅。

498
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:14,010
O.K.咁咧冇其他問題，咁咧陳議員，你啱啱仲有冇仲有冇問題要問㗎？

499
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:56,530
關於嗰個誒清晰嘅指令就係指引啦，就係話即係關於呢個誒充電寶等等呢裝置應該放喺邊度咧？咁誒。

500
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:25,410
誒，仲係上飛機啦嚇。咁咧，如果飛機上面咧都冇誒嗰個充電嘅誒設施嘅話咧，咁咧一啲病人。

501
01:46:55,190 --> 01:47:12,360
係指某幾種類別嘅誒，包括sodium、包括lithium嘅電池嗰種係屬於危險品咧，就受呢個規管嘅啫。其他嘅包括一啲總之唔係重用或者充電用嗰啲咧，其實就係唔會受呢個影響嘅。係咪我我理解啱唔啱啊，陳？

502
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:47,210
嘅澄清嘅，需要清晰嘅指引嘅，唔可以話一個簡單就話誒誒，你問翻航空公司啦。咁其實即係呢個我諗大家唔想要嘅答案嚟嘅，係要需要啲清晰嘅指引，令到同埋亦都係要加強個宣傳添。定咗之後，定咗啲原因之後，要加強宣傳，要畀所有嘅誒航空嘅旅客都要。

503
01:42:56,300 --> 01:43:16,310
好誒，都多謝誒姚議員咁咧。我嘅意見咧，同姚評議員一一致嘅。咁啱啱咧誒都講過，唔使重複，即係加大嗰個宣傳啊，加大宣傳，畀啲親誒更加清晰嘅嗰個指引。咁咧，另外咧一個我嘅簡單問題咧，就係依家咧新規，如果係真係實施之後咧，佢唔畀嗰個。

504
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:45,700
又係有啲病人咧上飛機咧係攜帶嗰個自誒製氧機嘅，係嘛氧氣咁氧氣咧，如果係唔足嘅話咧，要要充電嘅。咁咧，如果係呢啲誒特定嘅個情況之下咧，有冇機會咧去考慮咧？一定嗰個安全標準嘅誒嗰個認證之下咧，可以豁免啦。

505
01:43:48,630 --> 01:44:08,640
好誒，多謝主席誒同埋議員頭先提問啦，我都一並誒回答啦。噉啊，睇下如果有誒再技術補充，我請同事再補充。咁首先咧就關於十一月嗰個簡介啦，噉我亦都係同業界包括呢一個誒一啲嘅貨運代理人啦、誒貨運人啦、航公司等等咧，噉就係做咗簡介會嘅。咁誒呢個簡。

506
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:28,650
簡介會裏邊咧，我哋都將誒我哋呢一個修訂啊，同埋即係所知道呢一個嘅技術指令最新嘅一啲嘅主要嘅修訂咧，就同佢哋講解咗一次嘅。咁誒咁多位嘅即係持份者咧，都係冇表示過有不同嘅意見，噉佢哋都係冇乜問題嘅。因為其實都講多少少咧，呢一個嘅國際運輸協會。

507
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:48,660
會data咧，佢哋喺誒比較早嘅時間就即係佢哋有參與喺國際民航組織裏邊呢一啲技術討論咧。咁有一啲呢啲嘅相關標準咧，已經放咗落佢哋自己嘅指引嘅規定裏邊㗎啦。咁所以好多航空公司啊等等嗰啲，其實誒已經知悉呢一啲噉樣嘅指引啦，亦都係跟隨緊嘅。咁呢個第一部分啦。咁誒第二樣嘢咧就係關。

508
01:44:56,820 --> 01:45:16,830
其實喺我哋考慮呢一個嘅噉嘅最新要求嘅時候咧，都考慮到誒，即係誒，讓翻一啲靈活性或者彈性畀翻啲乘客同埋航空公司嘅。咁所以唯一唯一大家知道嘅咧嘅要求就係唔可以放喺個行李架上邊。咁基本上呢個就係唯一嘅要求。咁其他就基本。

509
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,090
都喺呢度。

510
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:38,950
有一個係其他事項，誒，如果冇其他事項咧，我宣佈咧會議結束，多謝大家。

511
01:47:53,980 --> 01:48:12,070
佢即係整合咗，成為咗乘客同埋機組人員攜帶物品危險物品嘅一個規定，放咗喺我哋民航處網頁。咁裏邊就有羅列咗寫咗嗰啲咧，全部都係話誒，可能係限制上可以有有啲限制之下可以帶啊，或者邊啲不準帶啊。呢啲就比較清楚係畀乘客睇嘅呢個就。

512
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:43,190
咁誒，而第三咧就係關於嗰個誒，即係如果病人嘅設施嗰度啦。咁誒，一般嚟講咧，我哋對於呢一個嘅誒，即係一啲誒係用嚟做一啲嘅，譬如係誒治療啊、醫療設備啊等等咧，咁都係有一個不同嘅一個誒嘅豁免方面嘅。咁但係當然都有啲限制啦。

513
01:45:43,190 --> 01:46:03,200
啊，譬如佢個電量方面啊，等等咧，呢啲都係有限制嘅。咁呢啲咧係可以佢事先同航空公司溝通，咁然後咧就係話可以讓佢帶上去誒呢個航班。咁譬如而家一啲嘅輪椅啦，其實喺電動輪椅咧，佢有好大嚿電嘅。咁但係佢係如果符合嗰啲情況之下咧，其實佢同航。

514
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:35,180
啊！多謝主席。其實答咗㗎啦，就只不過我誒唯一一個誒關注點就係頭先第二個部分，咪講緊將鋰電池就改名做電池。噉就當然啦，你sodium啊或者其他啲咧都係危險品嗰種嘅。咁但係好好多啲街坊問我。

515
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:55,190
我就如果假如噉樣改動嘅話，咁若不嬲誒帶開啲三個A嗰啲嗰啲唔係即係誒可以充電嗰種，咁會唔會呢一個就已經係誒新規要求咧？噉我我覺得就唔係嘅，只不過細節就係我想趁呢個機會，你哋都解釋一下。其實嗰個真係。

516
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:33,970
係多謝袁提問啦。咁誒，其實呢個誒啱啱講緊嗰個標記咧，係用於誒貨運，即係譬如佢要將一件貨送上貨機，噉佢個黐嗰個嘅標記咧，就係用叫做電池，噉就話即係唔係用即係之前就鋰電池啦，咁而家就電池。咁誒，所以呢一個咧係其實唔。

517
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:53,980
唔影響乘客攜帶佢個誒，譬如話我帶一個嘅誒充電寶，或者係帶一啲其他裝置噉，能夠容讓呢一個誒乘客攜帶相機嘅物品咧。其實技術指令裏邊係有即係已經有個列表，係話乜嘢可以帶，就包括頭先我講嗰啲啦。咁而呢一啲咧，我哋都將佢。

518
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:33,150
O.K.誒冇其他問題，咁咧討論誒完畢誒完畢啊！咁咧請問咧委員是否支持咧係將上述嘅立法建議咧係誒提交個立法會？支持好咁咧誒都多謝今日咧三位政府官員咧嚟參會嚇，咁誒最後。
