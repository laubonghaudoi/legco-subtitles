1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
進度多謝主席。

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,460
質詢。

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,820
第一項質詢，石禮軒議員。

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,590
多謝，主席。

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:25,440
The report of the steering committee of the review of legal education and training, released in August 2001, recommended that the postgraduate qualification programme, namely postgraduate certificate in law (PCIL),

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,490
被 discontinued， and a freestanding institution be established.

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:47,500
preferably in its own premises to conduct a course of practical vocational preparation for law graduates seeking to be admitted as barristers or solicitors in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Law Society proposed a new

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:01:07,790
Qualifying examination for solicitors to replace the examinations conducted by the three universities running Bachelor of Laws and PCIL programme, namely University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong. In this connection, will the government inform this council? A.

9
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:28,230
whether it knows in the past three years the respective numbers of LLB or juris doctor (JD) graduates from these three universities, the respective numbers of LLB and JD graduates from local and overseas university applying for and being admitted or not admitted to the

10
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:48,240
PCIL program run by these three universities, their success rates and the admission criteria of such programs. B. Of the basis and authority on which the government has granted these three universities, which are institution providing tertiary education, the

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:03,330
Power to determine who shall be qualified to be a lawyer, or running by running the PCIL programmes, as completion of such programmes was a prerequisite for law degree holders to become lawyers, and C.

12
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:23,630
given that the PCCL programme run by the three universities have different curricula and examinations, whether the government will consider making reference to the practice of the United States and Australia in introducing a common qualifying examination for law graduates in order to uphold

13
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:43,640
the principle of fairness and openness, and to ensure that the entrance to the legal professions are well qualified. Whether the government will actively considering introducing amendments to the legal practitioner ordinance to abolish all PCIL programmes, if it will of the details, if

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:55,490
Not the reasons for that, and whether it will adopt measures to increase the number of legal practitioners in Hong Kong and enhance the professional standards. Thank you. 教育局局長。

15
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:10,430
主席， as the present question is concerned with policy matters under the purview of both the Department of Justice and the Education Bureau.

16
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,380
我代表兩方，給予一個聯合回應，如下。

17
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,870
for the first question.

18
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,610
從The Academic Year 2010-11 to 2012-13。

19
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:44,900
The total number of students graduating from each year from the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) programmes, including the double law degree programmes offered by University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong and City University of Hong Kong, ranged from 310.

20
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,150
到三千四百四十三。

21
00:03:47,580 --> 00:04:04,590
as for the juris doctor JD programmes, which are offered by the three universities on a self-financing basis, total number of students graduating each year ranged from 294 to 341.

22
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:25,020
Over the past three academic years, total number of applications for the postgraduate certificate in laws (PCLL) programmes received by the three universities each year range from 1,203 to 1,522, including both.

23
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:42,480
836 and 1,003 applications lodged by the graduates with local law qualifications, and between 326, as well as the 405 lodged by graduates with non-local law qualifications.

24
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:52,870
It should be noted here that a law graduate can submit applications for PCCL admission to more than one university.

25
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,530
The total number of admitted PCLL students as a percentage to the total number of PCLL applications.

26
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:20,820
receive by the three universities has been quite stable over the past three academic years, ranging from forty one percent to forty six percent in respect of students with local qualifications, and forty two to forty three percent in respect of students with non local qualifications.

27
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,430
係。

28
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:32,600
given that law graduates can lodge multiple applications for PCCL admission, the actual success rate of applicants should be even higher.

29
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:42,290
Further details, including breakdown figures by institutions, are set out at the annex A. For sake of time, I will not repeat here.

30
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:54,090
pursuant to the Section 474A, Section 1 of the Legal Petitioners Ordinance, Cap. 159, LPO.

31
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:03,170
The Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training (SCLET) has been established since 2004.

32
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:22,880
among other things, S.C.L.E.T. is empowered under the Section 74A, 2A, Section Subsection 2 of the L.P.O. to keep under review, evaluate and assess the academic requirements and standards for P.C.L.L. admission.

33
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:43,250
SLET has prescribed the entry requirements to the PCLL applicable to all students seeking admission from September two thousand and eight onwards. A copy of the relevant statement by the SLET on the entry requirements is at the Annex B.

34
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,730
係。

35
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:56,780
All three universities have confirmed that, for applicants who have fulfilled these stipulated entry requirements, selections for PCLE admission is solely based on merit.

36
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:04,260
Taking into account a number of factors such as academic excellence and interview performance.

37
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,250
第二個問題。

38
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:25,020
Empowered by their respective governance ordinances to offer the degree programme, City U, Chinese U and Hong Kong U, currently provide a variety of law-related degree programmes at various levels for those who wish to pursue legal education and training.

39
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:36,850
for example, LLB, including the double law degree, JD, PCLL, as well as other law-related taught and research postgraduate programmes.

40
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:46,120
In so far as the eligibility requirements for admission, as solicitors or barristers in Hong Kong are concerned.

41
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,760
They are set out in the LPO and its subsidiary legislation.

42
00:07:51,110 --> 00:08:11,120
According to section 4 and 27 of the LPO, the court may admit a person whom the court considers to be fit and proper as a solicitor or a barrister of the High Court, provided that such a person has complied complied with the relevant requirements prescribed by the two legal

43
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,320
專業專業體，namely Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association.

44
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:37,610
The Council of the Law Society and the Council of the Bar Association have, for this purpose, prescribed requirements with respect to residency, the passing of examinations and the completion of the vocational training for prospective lawyers. Completion of the PCLL programmes offered by any of the three universities is currently.

45
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:53,350
Currently stipulated is the in the subsidiary legislation made by the two legal professional bodies as a prerequisite for entering into a trainee solicitor contract or for admission as a barrister.

46
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:01,550
relevant provisions can be found in section seven of the trainee solicitors' rules, as well as the section four of the barristers.

47
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:23,030
Apart from prescribing the entry requirements for PCL admission and among other things, SLET is also empowered by the LPO to keep under review, evaluate and assess the system and provision of the legal education and training in Hong Kong. SLET is now chaired.

48
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,180
由啲 honourable justice。

49
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:35,310
Patrick Chan and P.J. and consists of members representing the judiciary, the Department of Justice, Education Bureau, Law Society.

50
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:43,450
The bar association, the three universities, the Federation for Self-Financing Teacher Education, as well as members of the public.

51
00:09:43,740 --> 00:10:03,750
The administration understands that SCLT will conduct a large-scale review of the present system of the legal education and training in Hong Kong, with a view to enhancing the system to meet the challenge the challenges of legal practice and needs of Hong Kong. The question of a common qualifying exam.

52
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:23,760
資格 for entry into the legal profession is likely to be one of the issues to be studied by this SCLT in the review. Administration takes the view that the SCLT is an appropriate forum to consider the issue, given its terms of reference and its membership, which includes representatives from the

53
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,560
兩個法律專業體係、兩所大學和司法。

54
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:47,090
行政進一步指出，律師會最近已通知立法會法律事務委員會，關於行政公署司法及法律事務處，律師會將舉行諮詢會，就公證人資格考試的可行性進行討論。

55
00:10:47,370 --> 00:11:07,380
The administration will give due consideration to the results of the review to be carried out by the SCLT and the consultation to be conducted by the Law Society. It will also listen carefully to the views of all stakeholders with a view to enhancing the professional standards of our legal petitioners and the development.

56
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,360
of the legal profession. Thank you. Sir, let him you.

57
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,670
多謝，主席。我感謝秘書長給予全面的回覆我的問題。

58
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:28,980
The reply actually highlighting the failure of the present system of PCIL, in meeting with the popularity of legal studies.

59
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,730
在香港，The aims of education of the university is to transfer knowledge.

60
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:42,420
and to provide vocational training, and not to play God to decide who can enter the kingdom of.

61
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
律 legal profession.

62
00:11:44,670 --> 00:12:04,680
所以，如果你見從The Reply Annex A of the of the reply given by the Secretary of the local graduates who can qualify to be admitted to the legal profession, only 45 around 45% of the local graduates that can.

63
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:24,690
be admitted to the PCIL program, so the other fifty five percent would have to, after three years or four years training, they have to have, even if they want to be a lawyer, they would not even be given the chance to sit in the examination to go for a qualifying legal profession. So I like to.

64
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:38,320
No, from the administration, what what are the views of the administration in giving the university the right to decide who should be loyal, who should not be loyal among qualifying students?

65
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,780
局長。

66
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,590
先生，多謝各位成員的質詢。

67
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,580
If you look at the

68
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,410
S.C.L.E.T.

69
00:12:52,790 --> 00:13:12,800
The development and the decision is to conduct a comprehensive review of the whole provision and qualification, in particularly the law societies' intent to have an overview of the centralised examination qualification. This.

70
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,960
all pointed out to the.

71
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,090
the need of another good overall review. That's the first point I would like to make.

72
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:41,380
The second point is the universities that have pretty much a high level of autonomy, working together with the UGC and also the self-financing planning as to how many, what content, so on so forth of the provision and the planning out of the triennium.

73
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,890
教育 provision。

74
00:13:43,170 --> 00:14:03,180
and the good news would be the universities when doing all this also work very closely with relevant stakeholder groups including the professional bodies. last but not the least, as far as I understand, President, many of the law degree graduates they may not because of the needs of

75
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:16,740
The communities getting a lot more diversified. They might be going to the commercial sector and other sectors as well. There's a very ample need as well, the legal professional services as well. So that's my few points of responses. Thank you.

76
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,410
郭榮亨議員。

77
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:40,000
主席，啊，主席好，啊，多謝石禮謙，啊，石禮謙議員咧，今日提出呢個啊問題。我知道石議員佢自己都喺度讀緊法律嘅一個課程，以佢嘅聰聰明才智咧，我相信佢入到BCL係絕對唔難嘅。不過，啊，石禮謙議員今日提出嗰個誒問題咧，確實係真。

78
00:14:40,000 --> 00:15:00,010
係好多啊！讀緊法律嘅學生面對嘅你睇翻今日誒局方畀嘅數字咧，其實誒喺本地法律學誒嘅學生咧，其實每一年有差唔多七百個，再加上喺外國畢業嘅咧有成一千四百幾個每一年嘅法律誒院嘅學生，但係。

79
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:20,020
係咧，P.C.L.L嘅學位咧，你每年只係收六百個，即係話過半數讀法律嘅學生咧，都係攞唔到呢個誒P.C.L.L嘅學位。咁變咗，其實變相就係扼殺咗佢哋喺法律界嗰個嘅發展。咁其實誒係咪話呢過半數嘅學生咧誒？

80
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:40,030
七百幾八百個都係全部都係唔應該做律師嘅，或者係冇噉樣嘅能力啦。我覺得絕對唔係啊！有好多呢啲學生咧，佢哋係喺外國嘅一啲好好嘅學校誒誒畢業，而係誒攞嘅成績咧，起碼都有係二等誒榮譽嘅誒生嚟嘅。而且你。

81
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,810
提出啲問題。

82
00:15:41,090 --> 00:16:00,430
主席，我想問咧，就係其實PCLL咧，啊啊嗰個重要性係肯定㗎啦。咁但係我哋而家唔夠，噉啊教育局點樣可以相應提供更多嘅資源，令到PCLL嗰個學位可以增加，令到PCLL嗰個教育質素可以提升咧？多謝主席，局長。

83
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:22,320
啊！多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。如果你睇翻咧，就係喺呢個UGC誒三大院校嘅課程，佢哋相當係自主式噉樣去運作，亦都係咧係配合翻咧係一啲嘅自資嘅呢個課程嘅呢個舉辦，所以變咗咧佢唔係純粹喺呢一個。

84
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:42,330
個U.G.C下邊嘅位數呢？度係重要嘅一部分。第二部分咧，頭先咧提咗咧係呢一個S.C.L.E.T呢個係啊法律教育及培訓常設委員會，亦都係瞭解到咧係要做一個咧整體嘅點土呢個咧，亦都係希望咧呢個都係一個課題咧，佢哋係。

85
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,060
都要考慮嘅。多謝主席。

86
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,200
耀祥工業園。

87
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,310
多謝主席。誒，我先申報，我係香港大學校務委員會嘅委員。

88
00:16:51,650 --> 00:17:01,970
主席喺法律專業證書課程咧，係取得本地法律執業資格嘅主要途徑。如果唔係唯一嘅途徑嘅話，

89
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:13,650
但係自個課程自從喺一九七二年開辦以嚟咧，只係喺二零零一年由當時嘅檢討香港法律教育及培訓督導委員會委託嘅顧問。

90
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,440
Rebun and Roper.

91
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,490
進行一個研究，雖然顧問公司係建議停辦呢個專業課程。

92
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:27,650
同同埋成立一個獨立機構咧，係提供法律專業職業嘅課程。

93
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,490
但係，最終督導委員會係唔接納有關嘅改革建議。

94
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,320
只係喺課程嘅內容同埋考核方面咧，作出改革。

95
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,350
而家過咗十年啦。

96
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,480
Juris Doctor同埋雙學位法律課程咧，正喺度不斷咁擴展同埋膨脹。

97
00:17:44,760 --> 00:18:02,320
而司法亦都不斷向香港嘅法律服務業開放內地市場。我想問一問有關當局，會唔會再次對呢個法律專業證書呢個考核機制咧作出一次全面嘅檢討？就唔係一忽一忽咁去做。

98
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,930
如果唔係嘅話，請問原因係咩咧？局長。

99
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:26,850
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。呢個正正係問題嘅核心。我哋好希望咧，係透過呢一個常設委員會嘅檢討之後咧，係全面噉樣去睇呢個咧有關嘅呢個情況同埋建議，然之後咧再作呢一個進一步嘅分析。多謝主席。

100
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,910
善眾加油！

101
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:47,190
喺嗰個SCLT未檢討完成之前咧，就我想問教育局有冇一啲嘅誘因或者措施，你哋可以做，亦都係誒相對尊重到院校嘅自主性嘅前提之下，能夠誒增加到。

102
00:18:48,830 --> 00:19:04,900
啲學生入讀呢個即係法律嘅學士學生入讀呢個P.C.L.O嘅機會咧，似乎而家咧就嗰個數字係令人失望嘅，亦都係可能耗費咗一啲嘅資源咧，培訓咗一啲即係法律知識嘅人咧，但係攞唔到法律嘅資格。

103
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:17,940
噉啊，政府有冇啲咩嘅誘因？例如有冇啲專款專項可以係誒透過啲學校增辦課課程等等噉樣樣，咁令到嗰個嘅誒能夠入讀呢啲嘅學生咧？

104
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,280
嘅機會係增加嘅，例如改善到有冇嘅指標改善到係百分之七十啊，或者百分之六十啊噉樣樣，局長。

105
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,620
多謝主席。

106
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:49,020
我哋咧喺呢個係UCC嘅機制之下咧，一個三年嘅呢一個檢討嘅程序咧，呢個時間表係繼續嘅。所以如果係有需要喺呢方面需要加強咧，我都會係同呢一個UCC嗰方面咧喺呢個討論呢個問題。第二部分咧，我再強調咧，啊主席。

107
00:19:49,020 --> 00:20:09,030
喺呢一個提供呢一個有關嘅學習機會嘅時候咧，我哋幾個層面都有做嘅。我再強調咧，就係呢一個咧自資嗰個啊層面咧，亦都有好多學位喺嗰度誒呢個推展。再提翻有時頭先有提到少少關於PCLL嗰部分啦。如果我嘅資料冇錯嘅話咧，喺

108
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:29,040
使用公帑資助嘅PCLL嘅學額咧，喺零七零八年咧，都已經係將佢咧加堆個位數一百七十，加到去二百零六。咁咧都睇到咧，係都不斷咧就有關嘅需要咧，都會咧係作適時嘅一啲嘅誒檢視。再強調咧就係咧，我都係好期望咧嗰個SCLET嘅委員。

109
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:37,460
會整體全面嗰陣時咧，正如頭先威議員提到咧，係整體噉樣去睇嗰個整個項目整個範疇，多謝主席。

110
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,270
更加要。

111
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:52,110
主席，我嘅理解咧，就係如果你由學生去進入依個法律界咧，依個法學專業證書課程係唯一可以取得執業資格嘅途徑嘅。

112
00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:12,480
主席，依個誒，所以畢業嘅人數咧，係直接可以影響到法律界咧，每一年咧係有幾多新血。噉我睇到啲數字咧，我係留意到咧，就係持有非本地法律資歷嘅畢業生所佔嘅比例咧，其實都去到大約三成一度，噉係一個相當高嘅比例。我想問問局。

113
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:32,490
想啊，就係咧，就係其實誒，當局有冇做過任何嘅研究或者調查咧？依啲非本地法律資歷嘅畢業生，其實有幾多係繼續係係香港人，同埋繼續會留喺香港度執業咧？噉，即係我理解，其實誒不少嘅即係其他地方，包括係內地嘅學生咧，都。

114
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:52,500
選擇嚟香港係就讀香港法律嘅，噉我就唔係好明白，始終唔係好明白點解會有啲噉嘅情況出現。但係個情況就存在咁誒，有冇作過研究去諗啊？其實有幾多人攞到個資格之後，其實係留喺香港執業咧？若果係誒太多人唔係留喺香港執業嘅話，我哋需唔需要檢討？

115
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,810
報一下呢個比例咧，我想我局長可唔可以回答一下？局長。

116
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,440
多謝主席。

117
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:15,860
啊！我哋咧冇呢個有關呢一方面嘅資料，不過咧，我會答應議員咧，我翻去睇一睇我哋現有嘅各種嘅來源嘅資料裏邊咧，有冇呢一方面喺呢方面咧作一個係同大家稍後嘅一個分享，如果我有關嘅資料，多謝主席。

118
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:24,840
即係話會面回覆我哋係嘛？啊，湯議員，佢係咪即係話會會書面回覆我哋係嘛？啊，局長，可否書面回覆議員？

119
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,300
誒可以嘅，可以書面誒會後咧係回應會議員。

120
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,770
嗱，呢項質詢咧已經係用咗啱超過二十二分鐘啦。第二項質詢，湯家華議員。

121
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:56,060
主席，較早前咧係有本地嘅傳媒報導一宗喺意大利法庭審理嘅案件。身為前參議院嘅被告人咧，夏青前參議員喺作證嘅時候透露，本身係天主教徒嘅上任行政長官，曾於二零零八年透過時任本。

122
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:16,070
本港駐布魯塞爾歐洲共同體特派嘅代表，下稱特派代表，現任嘅運輸及房屋局常任秘書長房屋引線，要求該參議員安排他獲時任教宗本篤十六世私人接見。

123
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:36,130
前參議員又表示，他曾答應作出安排，但提出以香港政府拒絕向意大利檢控當局移交涉及意大利前總理舞弊及洗黑錢案的證據作為交換條件，而特派代表書面回發回覆他時表示。

124
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:56,140
已與當時的律政司司長商討該事宜，並正跟進前參議員的要求，就現規就現規管行政長官及政府官員以其公職身份處理私人事務，以及當局向海外檢察部門移交案件。正

125
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:16,150
證據，政府可否告知本會一哪些特區政府官員曾處理上述事件，以及上述的會面有否進行？若有會面詳情為何？包括會面的日期以及是否官式會面？而根據現行規定，行政長官。

126
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:36,160
官是否有權指使官員為其辦理私人事務？若然，有關的準則為何，以及有何監察機制防止濫用？該底私人事務的範圍是否包括涉及個人信仰的事務？若不包括，政府會否調查？

127
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:56,170
在上述事件中，是否有任何人以權謀私或行為不當？約會詳情為何？若否，原因為何？及三，根據現行規定，行政長官是否有權指示律政司及司法機關拒絕移交刑事案件的證據與？

128
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:16,180
海外檢察部門若有權力的法律基礎及來源為何？政府會否調查在上述事件中是否有任何人曾作出不當的行為或作出妨礙司法公正等違法行為？若會調查，詳情為何？若否，原因為何？

129
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:23,720
商務及經濟發展局局長主席就提問嘅三個具體部分咧，而家係回覆咧係如下嘅第一部分。

130
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,880
根據記錄，上任行政長官於二零零八年並冇出訪歐洲。

131
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:50,170
亦都沒亦沒有會見教宗。此外咧，上任行政長官喺二零零八年亦冇透過時任香港駐歐洲共同體特派代表（下稱時任特派代表）要求一位前意大利參議員安排佢獲時任教宗本篤十六。

132
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,090
私人接見。

133
00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:10,580
問題嘅第二部分，《基本法》第四十八條規定咗行政長官所行使嘅權力，包括作為特區政府嘅首長，領導特區政府施政。行政長官及其領導嘅特區政府一直依法施政，受相關嘅法律所約束。

134
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:30,870
就安排行政長官嘅外訪活動方面咧，一直以嚟由特區政府有關嘅經濟貿易辦事處（下稱經貿辦）同埋政府新聞處協助安排。由於官式出訪嘅行程大多咧係十分係緊湊充充實，如有需要。

135
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:50,880
咧經貿辦亦都會就行程中嘅非官式活動提供適當嘅協助，目的咧係要確保誒整個行程咧係暢順進行。但喺整體嘅行程安排上咧，必定係以公務嘅活動咧為先。經貿辦嘅工作重點。

136
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,460
亦都係以公務活動咧為優先嘅考慮。

137
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:15,290
問題嘅第三部分就涉及刑事事宜嘅法律協助方面咧，刑事事宜相互法律協助條例（香港法例嘅第五百二十五章，下稱條例）已經清楚就香港處理其他司法管轄區喺刑事事宜上要求。

138
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,660
提供協助嘅安排，訂定有關嘅條文。

139
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:31,720
就湯家華議員嘅提問中引述嘅傳媒報導，律政司已於本年十月三日發出新聞公佈，文本咧係見附件嘅。

140
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:42,870
詳細交代有關嘅事實，正如該新聞公佈所述，律政司喺二零零六年九月收到意大利當局就。

141
00:27:43,300 --> 00:28:03,310
在當地進行嘅一宗刑事程序及偵查發出嘅司法請求書，要求交出包括銀行記錄及在搜查指定嘅商用和誒住宅嘅地點後咧，檢取嘅文件嘅證據。二零零七年一月十六日，本港嘅財。

142
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:23,320
裁判官根據條例就批准搜查入相關嘅商用及住宅地點，發出四份嘅搜查令。呢啲嘅搜查令於二零零七年一月十八日執行，但其後由於該事件衍生咗多次嘅法法庭嘅申請同聆訊，律政司喺。

143
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:31,480
喺二零一三年八月，先至能夠咧將因執行搜查令而取得嘅資料送交意大利當局。

144
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,250
整段期間。

145
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:53,550
律政司一直係嚴格依從包括條例嘅香港法律行事處理要求請求書嘅整個過程，完全係冇受到不當嘅影響，亦都冇考慮其他與該案件無關嘅因素。正如上述新聞公佈所述，由

146
00:28:53,550 --> 00:29:13,560
二零零六年九月至二零一三年八月期間，時任特派代表與律政司就上述有關司法請求書嘅唯一聯絡，只有佢哋與時任律政司處理國際法律專員，下稱處理專員，於二零零七年十月九日及十。

147
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:33,570
日進行嘅電郵聯絡當中咧係並冇提及任何關於約見教宗嘅要求，佢只係通知處理專員時任意大利參議員Gregorio，即係時任嘅意大利參議院國防委員會主席及時任特派。

148
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,390
代表於羅馬嘅其中一名聯絡人，曾與佢聯誒接觸。

149
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:50,610
誒並且查詢上述要求書喺香港執行嘅情況，時任特派代表指出，佢已經告知時任嘅參議員。

150
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,310
誒，Gregorio若果事件咧，已經於法庭去提訊。

151
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,600
政府不可能發表評論。

152
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:18,890
時任特派代表就佢應該點樣樣去應對時任參議員嘅Gorio嘅查詢咧，要求律政司提供意見。處理專員於二零零七年十月十日回覆時任特派代表嘅電郵，證實律政司已收到上述請求書並告知。

153
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:29,940
時任並告知時任特派代表有關當事人正就審查令嘅有效性同執行過程嘅合法性，提出司法複核。

154
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:41,810
處理專員建議時任特派代表可告知佢喺羅馬嘅聯絡人有關執行意大利當局提出嘅相互法律協助嘅法律事宜。

155
00:30:42,090 --> 00:31:02,100
正在喺香港嘅法庭處理。除此之外咧，時任特派代表並冇就上述嘅請求書與律政司任何人員，包括處理專員同時任律政司司長進行溝通。時任律政司司長亦都證實，佢係冇就處理該。

156
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:22,110
事件與時任特派專員商討或進行任何其他形式嘅聯絡。此外咧，時任律政司司長亦都冇收到上述時任特派代表及處理專員之間嘅電郵副本。律政司喺處理該請求書嘅時候，從

157
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:42,120
沒有考慮其他與該案件無關嘅因素，包括安排與教宗會面。多謝主席。張家賢，我即係對於誒即係當局嘅回覆，噉就非常之詫異嘅。主席，我呢個誒質詢咧係問關於前特首嘅操守嘅行為，噉我就唔明白第一點。

158
00:31:42,120 --> 00:32:02,130
點解會係商務及經濟發展局局長回答？唔係政務司司長或者政制事務局局長回答。第二，主席啊，局長係完全冇回應到我第二同埋第三個問題嘅。不過，因為我只可以有一個跟進問題咧，主席，我就問一個最重要嘅問題。主席，事實咧就係外國有位。

159
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:19,500
參議員喺個司法程序裏邊提出咗言之確確嘅證據，就係話佢要求我哋嘅前特首啊作為交換條件咧，係拒絕咧係誒即係將一啲誒有關嘅證據咧係而交畀意大利嘅法庭。

160
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:30,330
而依個依對於噉嘅要求咧，我哋嘅前特首咧，根據依個參議員咧係答應咗嘅，亦都係指使當時嘅專員咧係去跟進。嗱，我而家唔係問。

161
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:50,840
佢實際有冇做到呢件事，或者係律政司有冇被幹預？我唔係問呢個問題，我問嘅就係話：若果我哋嘅前特首係真係好似呢位參議員咁講，向一位外國嘅議員去承諾去幹擾我哋嘅司法程序，呢個噉樣嘅過程，呢個噉樣嘅承諾本身。

162
00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:05,810
係咪行為不當？第二就係話，若果有機會行為不當嘅，我哋特區政府有冇就呢個前特首嘅行為去徹查事件？有個結果係乜嘢？冇點解冇去徹查？

163
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,370
局長。

164
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:29,010
即係我想回應呢個問題咧，其實頭先啊湯家華議員講咗好多唔係事實嘅嘢，我必須要澄清。喺我嘅主題答案裏邊咧，已經係將呢件事咧係係好詳細咁去解釋。喺呢一個嘅誒關於呢個司法嘅程序裏邊咧，係有前參議員咧係對於呢件。

165
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:49,020
件事咧作出一個查詢，咁作為咧我哋嘅時任嘅特派代表咧，亦都因為呢個係司法嘅一個嘅程序咧，係當時咧係有曾經有個電郵去查詢呢件事係係個情況係點樣樣，得知亦都喺法庭裏邊處理緊，所以亦都一個答案咧就係呢。

166
00:33:49,020 --> 00:34:09,030
呢一個法例法定嘅程序進行之期間咧，佢係唔能夠評論事情就係噉樣。特首喺呢件事裏邊咧係冇牽涉喺裏邊嘅，所以唔存在有啲乜嘢嘅承諾係由特首度嚟。呢件事咧就係好清楚，已經喺我主題答案裏邊咧，喺呢個是將我哋嘅你我。

167
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:17,310
據我哋了呃瞭解嘅一個一個嘅事實咧，已經喺我哋嘅主體答案裏面咧，已經係講得好清楚啦。多謝主席。

168
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:29,520
冇帶啲問題。嗰時我哋嘅口頭質詢成日都係雞同鴨講嘅，主席。請重複你問題。係好簡單嘅，因為呢位參議員喺意大利嗰個司法程序所作嘅證供係事實嚟嘅。

169
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,640
佢係講咗，佢唔係話去查詢。

170
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:53,930
誒誒，而家個進度係點樣？佢個證據好確鑿，係話佢要求而特首亦都承諾去啊啊，幹預依個司法香港嘅司法程序。咁依個噉樣嘅指控提出咗，我個問題係問點解特區政府唔會徹查事件？有冇去？

171
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,510
要求前特首係解釋。

172
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,390
如果冇嘅，點解冇依個噉樣嘅徹查嘅過程？

173
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,680
局長，唔好錯。主席，我再重申，其實呢一個咧係二零零七年。

174
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:27,070
十月九號同埋二零零七年十月十號嘅電郵咧，係由現任嘅特派代表同埋咧，我哋嘅律政司裏邊嘅同事咧，去查詢呢一件事係冇特首牽扯裏邊，唔成完全咧。頭先啊湯議員講嘅。

175
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:39,160
所謂嘅事實咧，係係完全冇涉及到呢個嘅誒特首參與喺呢個查詢裏邊，亦都呢個亦都唔係事實。所以主席，我已經講得好清楚。

176
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:47,750
我唔係問個電郵嘅問題，我係問呢個參議員喺外國嗰個司法程序所作出嘅正功嘅問題，點解唔答我咧？

177
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,130
啊，局長。

178
00:35:49,410 --> 00:36:09,420
是否有就誒意大利嘅參議員嘅政功，特區政府要作調查？是否要作調查？有冇調查？主席，據理解，據我嘅瞭解咧，已經係喺成件事嘅情況咧，係已經喺我嘅主體答案裏邊講，就係當時嘅誒前參議員咧。

179
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,970
係有一個嘅查詢，係透過我哋嘅誒時任嘅特派代表咧，係。

180
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:37,260
係用啲電郵嘅方式，電郵嘅內容咧，其實亦都好清楚披露喺裏邊。特首根本就冇牽扯喺裏邊，來能夠話即係單憑一方面嘅就呢一個嘅喺意大利嘅程序咧，就話呢一個係事實。因為我哋嘅據理解，我哋嘅我哋嘅事實嘅理解咧，已經喺我嗰個嘅主題答個裡。

181
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,380
面咧好清楚咁披露出嚟啦，多謝主席，梁家傑。

182
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,650
誒，主席啊，唔怪得大公報咧～

183
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,980
都話蘇錦良局長論盡啦。

184
00:36:48,320 --> 00:37:04,370
其實而家湯家華問嘅問題係好簡單啫嘛，你睇下第二條問題，佢話根據現行規定，行政長官是否有權指示官員為其辦理私人事務？

185
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:24,660
咁呢個係問可唔可以公僕私用嘅問題啊？嘛，唔係問有冇公僕私用啊？嘛，咁都唔明白，仲唔係論準？我畀多次機會你洗脱呢個論準嘅指控啦。你不如答一答湯家華議員，究竟根據而家嘅規定，行政長官有冇權？

186
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:31,180
去指示官員為其辦理私人事務咧，主席、局長。

187
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,280
我估唔到啊！

188
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:53,050
阿梁議員咧係用啲標籤嘅去加啲加諸於於官員，咁所以你中意噉樣樣，我亦都唔能夠阻止你。不過回答你嘅問題咧，我哋經貿辦嘅同事咧係負責咧喺啲公務方面咧，為我哋特區政府嘅同事咧作出呢個安排。

189
00:37:53,330 --> 00:38:12,390
但係好多時咧，佢哋呢一啲嘅公務咧，因為都係嗰啲安排咧係非常之緊湊，喺我主體裏、主體答案裏邊咧，亦都已經係講係提述咗。但喺唔影響公務嘅活動嘅誒日程嘅安排同埋資源許可之下之下咧。

190
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:32,680
我哋嘅經貿辦嘅嘅同事咧，亦都會就主要官員嘅非官式嘅活動去安排，提供一啲適當嘅協助，例如係提供一啲嘅意見，例如係協助佢哋聯絡噉。目的咧係令到整個嘅外訪嘅行程咧，各個環節咧都能夠順利嘅配。

191
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,900
同埋咧係順暢嘅進行，咁呢個係好清晰嘅。多謝主席。

192
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,980
借位尊女。

193
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:59,660
即係本會咧，就一個委員會經過六七次嘅聆訊咧，就發覺原來即係我哋嘅廉政公署嘅專員咧，都可以委派佢啲同事咧，就替佢買魚蛋、牛腩，好多私人嘅禮物都可以做得嘅。個問題就係咁啦，咁特首有冇噉樣做咧？咁主席，我哋未發展到咧，我哋嘅所，我哋嘅領。

194
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:19,670
導人咧，所有嘅口頭嘅通訊咧，都好似美國總統一樣，無論個BlackBerry又好電話，係咪錄音又係有記錄嘅。香港係未有呢個制度嘅。噉，正如特首琴日回答有關香港電視發牌嘅時候講，記錄上冇呢個高官嘅對話，冇呢個承諾，梗係冇啦。口頭㗎嘛，呢個世界有口頭嘅嘢㗎嘛。一問你就係話。

195
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:39,680
究竟有冇發生嗰啲噉嘅事？我想問一問局長，就係第一個問題，你答案裏面話根據記錄冇出訪，噉啊講一大輪嘢啦。但係你似乎就完全冇任何查詢嘅動作做過嘅。相反咧，第三段答案咧，關於前任或者現任律政司咧，有好多時有證實嘅。咁個。

196
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:54,110
政策係點樣嚟嘅咧？係全靠你記錄啊，定還是有口頭上問過咧？咁呢一方面，究竟當局有冇嘗試過同時任嘅特首、時任嘅任何官員去了解實際情況，定還是望一望記錄冇就答冇咧？

197
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,700
局長。

198
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,360
即係其實喺呢件事裏邊咧，係我諗語言係混淆咗兩件事。

199
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:21,650
喺二零零七年，我哋講緊嗰樣嘢咧，就係意大利嘅前參議員咧，係曾經同我哋現任嘅特誒特派代表咧，係查詢過關於呢一個法律司法嘅程序。噉係有兩個嘅電郵，啊，即係兩日嘅電郵，誒十月九號同埋十月十號嘅嘅電郵裏。

200
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:41,660
邊咧係大家咧係有畀過呢一個嘅誒呢個程序啊！我哋嘅律政司嘅同事咧喺呢度咧，佢個電郵嘅內容咧已經係好清楚係披露咗出嚟。咁呢個係二零零七年發生嘅事，係關於個司法程序發生嘅事。二零零八年咧係另外一樣嘢咧，就係。

201
00:40:41,690 --> 00:41:01,700
特首曾經咧係安排咧，二零零八年原本咧係去出訪去歐洲嘅。咁呢個係二零零八年事，兩件事係分開。二零零八年咧，亦都係因為特首咧公務在身咧，係決定咗係唔會係出訪歐洲呢一個嘅行程。兩件事唔而家你將佢連埋一齊咧。

202
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:11,250
我認為咧，亦都同事實不不符。咁所以咧，據我嘅瞭解，呢個亦都係同埋咧，誒，據我哋同埋時任嘅。

203
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:19,100
誒特派嘅代表同埋上任嘅行政長官瞭解過之後咧，今日作出嘅答覆，多謝主席。

204
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,510
國家奇遇。

205
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,010
你睇。

206
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:45,300
我哋嘅蘇局長咧，最近唔知係咪受咗好多委屈噉啊？呢個有線呢個免費電視嚇，搞到佢琴日想喊咁滯。雖然又話佢演技麻麻，我而家問嘅問題就係噉。而家講講到咧，就係話有特首就話要求去見呢個教宗，佢話記錄上冇。

207
00:41:45,850 --> 00:42:05,860
你有冇問過前特首？佢有冇問過想見教宗啊？係咪連見教宗呢一啲嘢都要寫落個記錄？政府係明年呢啲所有嘅私人嘅要求，譬如話現任特首有啲特別嘅要求，或者上一任嘅廉政專員買魚蛋咧，都會用一個文字寫落去。如果唔係嘅話，點解唔會去調查或者問？

208
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,520
前特首，多謝主席，局長。

209
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:20,950
即係容許我講講，即係喺頭先，因為喺誒個答案裏邊咧講咗好多二零零七年發生嘅嘢，我想講緊二零零八年，唔想自然之間咧係將兩件事咧係混淆咗。

210
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:25,020
啊，有關呢啲嘅會議咧，亦都係喺多年前發生。

211
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:39,120
據我哋嘅瞭解咧，誒時任特派代表咧喺意大利嘅外訪期間，喺二零零八年嘅四月二十七號咧，係獲邀與該時任嘅參議員咧，即係Gregorio咧去會面。

212
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:53,370
時任嘅參議員咧，亦都係香港Italian-Sanit-French Group嘅前嘅前召集人，因此咧係同香港嘅駐布魯塞爾嘅經貿辦經常咧係會有聯繫嘅。

213
00:42:53,830 --> 00:43:13,840
誒，該時任嘅誒參議員咧，知道咧，布魯塞爾已經謀辦咧，係正就上任嘅行政長官可能會喺二零零八年到訪歐洲作準備，於是咧係主動去提出可以協助安排上任嘅行政長官咧，同埋教宗私人嘅見面。

214
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,700
亦都據我哋瞭解咧。

215
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:22,540
事任嘅特派代表咧，將有關嘅信息咧，向上任嘅行政長官親自去轉達。

216
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:42,830
上任行政長官請時任嘅特誒特派代表咧表示謝意，但係上任嘅行政長官亦都係告訴誒前任嘅特派代表咧喺香港嘅梵蒂岡代表咧已經就此事咧係與佢直接聯誒集直接咧係接觸嘅。

217
00:43:42,830 --> 00:44:00,460
所以成件事就係好簡單，係有一個嘅誒一個嘅誒offer啦，即係有一個嘅誒主動係係呢個嘅意大利嘅參議員咧，有呢一個嘅主動話接觸我哋嘅話可以安排，但係呢一個咧係冇受到接受嘅。多謝主席。

218
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
香港要。

219
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:24,000
亦我頭先問佢第二個誒問題嗰度咧，佢個回覆官誒正式嘅主體答案咧，佢就話：如果係涉及非官式活動咧，佢哋會提出適當嘅協助。我想問一問誒局長咧，其實佢有冇呢個非官式活動？其實有冇有冇限制嘅？有冇一個範？

220
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:41,430
範圍嘅，即係頭先同事都有問過，喂，咁買牛啊，依個魚蛋牛腩係咪都都都算係非官式活動咧？或者係買飛睇戲都係非官式活動？噉啊，我哋嘅公務員都會代特首去做呢啲嘢咧。我想佢講清楚，其實有冇限制？局長。

221
00:44:42,200 --> 00:45:02,210
主席誒，首先講個咩叫非官式活動咧？非官式活動咧，就指嘅所指係所有官式活動以外嘅活動，包括私人用膳啦，或者係會面噉樣樣嘅。咁當然頭先我主題答案咧已經係講咗啦，係以公務嘅活動係為優先。

222
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:22,220
咁喺呢一方面咧，整體要配合翻整體嘅公務嘅一個嘅誒環節咧，能夠順利去配合同埋暢順進行咧，誒我哋嘅經貿辦嘅同事咧，喺冇誒喺資源許可嘅誒情況之下咧，係會提供協助嘅。多謝主席。

223
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,550
型。

224
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:33,230
要雞同鴨講都冇辦法。主席，我問一個問題就係，即係如果前特首係要公務員去買牛腩、牛腩魚蛋、買飛睇戲。

225
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,090
佢可唔可以咁做咧？

226
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,790
局長，會補充。

227
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:58,080
我都講咗咧，其實咧係喺唔影響公務活動嘅日程安排同埋資源許可嘅情況之下咧，為咗使到整個外訪行程嘅各個環節能夠順利去配合同埋暢順嘅進嘅進行咧，係會係誒提供咧適當嘅協助嘅。多謝主席。第

228
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,040
第三項質詢，陳家洛議員。

229
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,210
多謝主席。

230
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:21,440
據報，香港考試及評核局（下稱考評局）從政府獲得的資助不足以支付舉辦公開考試的開支，而考評局需按自負盈虧的原則運作，因此未必有足夠資源改善其軟件及硬件設施。

231
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:36,610
就此，政府可否告知本會一過去五年考評局每年獲得的公帑資助總額、從各類公開考試獲得的考試費收入，以及舉辦公開考試的開支總額是多少？

232
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:56,920
二會否考慮檢討現時向考評局提供資助的機制及資助的水平？若會，詳情為何？若不會，原因為何？及三會否考慮由公堂支付所有公開考試的開支，以免除考生繳交考試費，從而舒。

233
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:04,700
寬緩他們的經濟負擔，若會詳情為何？若不會，原因為何？交通局局長。

234
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,600
主席。

235
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,020
就陳議員提出嘅問題，而家嘅答覆咧係如下嘅。

236
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,060
香港考試及評核局。

237
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:38,350
俗稱考評局喺一九七七年係根據《香港考試及評核局條例》，下稱條例係第二百六十一章成立嘅，係一個獨立嘅法定機構。主要嘅職能係配合本地教育制度同埋社會嘅需要，舉辦香。

238
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:44,030
講嘅公開考試，同埋協助舉辦專業同埋國際嘅考試。

239
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:56,390
根據條例第九條，考評局嘅資源係包括考生參加公開考試，或者該局舉辦嘅其他考試或者評核需要繳付嘅費用。

240
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:10,190
考評局為提供嘅服務而收取嘅費用，同埋由政府為協助應付各項公開考試舉辦費用而提供畀考評局嘅資助等等。

241
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,930
而家考評局收入主要嘅來源係嚟自考試費。

242
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:22,620
其次咧，就係啲罕物嘅銷售，同埋為個人同埋團體提供同埋考評相關嘅服務嘅收入。

243
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:37,310
由於考評局係香港唯一嘅法定機構，負責呢個舉辦香港中學文憑考試，係政府提供優質教育制度同埋支持新高中學制嘅策略夥伴。

244
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:43,970
喺有充分理據之下，政府係會向下平局提供非經常性嘅撥款。

245
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:51,120
以供推行同呢個公開考試有關嘅一啲特別非常常性嘅一啲措施。

246
00:48:51,570 --> 00:49:07,930
噉樣做法唔單止係有幫助到呢個減低舉辦公開考試嘅成本，亦都係確保咧考試嘅費用大致上係能夠足夠支付經常嘅開支，而且係處於市民可以負擔嘅水平。

247
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:26,930
喺過去五年，零九到一三年度，考評局獲立法會財務委員會批核嘅一次個撥款嘅資助，同埋咧舉辦各類公開試嘅收入同埋開支同埋收費，已經列喺呢個書面嘅回覆之中，我就唔喺呢度重複。

248
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:37,460
喺呢個第二條問題，下評局一直都按住個條例係以本身嘅收入同埋資產維持自己日常嘅運作。

249
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:47,310
喺充分理據支持之下，政府係會向考評局提供非經常性嘅撥款，從而減低呢個舉辦公開考試嘅成本。

250
00:49:47,590 --> 00:50:05,110
目前嘅制度運作咧係大致大致良好嘅，政府咧係暫時冇打算改變，不過政府會繼續留意考評局嘅財政狀況、舉辦公開考試嘅日常營運開支同埋呢個考試費嘅水平。

251
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:17,530
考評局必須提供或者處理嘅特別非經常性嘅服務，同埋對考試費可能帶嚟嘅影響等等，以檢視咧考評局對非經常撥款嘅需要。

252
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:37,940
第三條問題提到喺呢個公堂需要咧係要係使用得宜，用者自負係行之有效，亦都係體現咗喺唔同嘅政策範疇嘅收費嘅制度喺呢個原則之下，政府唔適宜咧一刀切為所有嘅考生支付。

253
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:56,850
所有嘅公開考試嘅開支，不過政府亦都理解到咧，公開考試對應考人士嘅前途同埋出路係好關鍵嘅作用，所以亦都咧係有政策係確保學生唔會因為經濟問題而唔能夠參加學校認為恰當嘅公開試。

254
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:05,230
鑑於青訓學生喺報考公開考試嘅時候，需要面對繳交考試費嘅負擔。

255
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:11,120
學生資助辦事處而家係設有考試費減免嘅計劃。

256
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:29,270
畀參加考評局舉辦嘅公開考試而經濟有需要嘅合資格學校考生，提供呢個考試嘅係減減免考試費嘅減免，合資格嘅學生可以申請全額或者半額嘅呢個考試費減免。

257
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,700
喺二零一二一三年度。

258
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:43,160
大約係有二萬五千六百個學生係成功申請到考試費嘅減免，佔整體學生考生數目大約係百分之三十四。

259
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,270
資助發放嘅總額大約係五千二百萬。

260
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:57,440
除此之外，社會福利處亦都係向領取綜合社會保障援助嘅家庭嘅學生提供公開考試費嘅津貼。

261
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:06,750
因此，合資格而經濟上有需要嘅學生，唔會因為經濟上嘅問題而唔可以參加公開嘅考試。

262
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:18,810
除咗資助經濟上有需要嘅學生考考試費之外，政府亦都係根據合理嘅依據，向考評局提供非經常性嘅撥款，以減低呢個公開考試嘅成本。

263
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:39,100
根據條例，公開考試費用嘅釐定係需要獲政府嘅批准嘅。政府喺決定係咪批准考考評局提出嘅考試收費嘅時候咧，考慮嘅因素係好多，包括通脹、本港嘅經濟狀況同埋考評局嘅財政狀況等等。我哋認為而家嘅模式係合理同埋公平，既可以保

264
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:48,370
並唔會有學生因為經濟困難而唔能夠參加公開試，亦都咧考試能夠咧維持咧市民能夠負擔嘅水平。多謝主席。陳家樂議員。

265
00:52:49,390 --> 00:53:00,900
主席，首先宣佈咧，我係因為大學嘅工作咧，喺一九九八年去到今年嘅十月之間咧，係一直協助考評局其中一個科目嘅考評嘅工作。

266
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:07,410
主席，我諗吳克儉局長都應該比我清楚嘅咧，就係佢自己本身加入政府之前咧。

267
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:27,700
亦都係考評局嘅成員，亦都係做過考評局嘅主席。雖然佢同考評局已經係分道揚標，但係我對於佢嘅答案咧，我就十分之不滿。講緊嘅其實係第二條，集中問嘅就係而家嗰個嘅營運嘅模式是否係能夠咧係繼續支持咧考評局。

268
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:42,660
一個作為我哋喺香港本地嘅公開考試一個咁重要嘅法定機構嘅工作，事實上今日主席除咗我嘅口頭質詢之外，都有兩條嘅書面質詢，加埋一齊睇咧就會知道考評局如果係處理本地。

269
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,940
嗯。

270
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,010
公眾職人士立即縮靜。

271
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:54,230
誒公眾席嘅人士離開會議廳，立即離開公眾席。

272
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,400
立即離開。

273
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:09,980
係啊！

274
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,900
打到邊個啊？李嘉誠。

275
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:38,650
整個六月。

276
00:54:41,890 --> 00:55:01,900
主席，事實上今日除咗我呢個口頭質詢之外咧，都有另外兩條嘅書面質詢，加埋一齊睇就會知道咧。如果單單淨係睇本地嘅考試考評局咧，係虧損，係平均咧係三千多萬一年，但係佢能夠賺嘅咧就係靠賺所謂嘅外快，亦都即係話咧一啲專業同埋海外嘅。

277
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,690
嘅考試亦都要靠咧考評局嘅職員咧，係走出街跑數。

278
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:27,080
局長呢個噉嘅運作模式咧，根本就不能夠持續嘅。請問局長你自己覺得曾經作為考評局嘅主席，呢個時候係咪應該檢討考評局嘅運作同埋資助嘅模式，等佢能夠咧係真真正正無正業而唔係不無正業咧？主席，局長。

279
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,730
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問同埋意見。

280
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:52,020
如果你睇翻呢一個考評局過去嘅情況，喺個別嘅項目上邊咧，佢係有虧損嘅。佢嘅虧損裏邊咧，通常例如話，最後一屆嘅呢個中學會考，佢一個咧虧損係比較大，亦都係在在咧政府誒呢個教育局咧係亦都定期咧係有派。

281
00:55:52,020 --> 00:56:00,570
我哋嘅代表坐喺有關嘅委員會上邊，我哋都係咧緊密噉樣咧同考評局咧係呢一個咧接觸同埋瞭解。

282
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:19,000
喺呢一個考評局嘅委員會上邊，包括佢財務委員會，其他咧都係經常檢討佢哋嗰個誒財政嘅模式嘅。大家都覺得咧，而家呢個階段裏邊，加埋其他有關嘅服務咧，基本上咧佢都係能夠咧係儘量做得到咧，係財政呢一個咧係平衡。

283
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:39,290
喺呢個大前提之下咧，佢哋會擔心嘅咧就係一啲個別嘅一啲嘅非經常性嘅項目，所以變咗咧啊呢個教育局政府咧特別係針對咧非經常性一啲特別需要嘅項目上面咧，我哋係多啲嘅呢一個支援，在在咧就係現在嗰個模式嘅形式。另外一部分都重要嘅咧就係咧。

284
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:59,300
因為考試咧都係個人一啲嘅一啲嘅安排，一啲其他嘅專業事咧，亦都係提供到一啲服務。咁變咗咧喺幾個多元嘅呢個服務模式之下咧，係能夠希望盡量達得到咧係財政平衡咧。呢個咧就佢現在呢一個噉嘅模式。啊，作為考評局以往七年嘅二。

285
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:19,310
嘅呢一個主席同埋參與好多嘅活動咧，我嘅理解咧都係咧，喺呢個係夏平哥本身咧都係覺得呢一個模式咧係相當咧係能夠可行，係都係希望咧係喺密切嘅呢一個交流同埋合作情況之下咧係可以咧係達到，亦都係畀佢咧有足夠嘅自主權咧係繼續優化。

286
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,410
佢個專業嘅服務，多謝主席。

287
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:41,930
對唔住，冇答你問題。冇答案問題嘅地方咧，就係在於佢話考評局嘅誒方面咧，係唔滿意呢個方法。如果滿意嘅就唔會係不務正業地去跑數。唔能夠容許辯論。請你重複，你認為局長冇答你嘅問題。主席，我問嘅問題就係吳克儉局長，你身為考評局以前嘅一個成員，會唔會？

288
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:46,400
喺任內，喺今年開始同考評局商討，檢多佢營運模式。

289
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,030
局長是否會檢討？係多謝主席，多謝議員。我今日咧係用呢個啊。

290
00:57:54,490 --> 00:58:14,500
教育局局長嘅身份答呢個問題，我喺呢個考評局嘅嗰七年咧嘅義務服務咧，已經係喺呢一個咧二零一二年七月一號咧完成咗。我而家由好客觀嘅角度咧去睇整件事件，頭先提到我係有我嘅代表坐喺呢個考評局嘅委員會上邊，佢哋都係咧。

291
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:34,510
同佢咧好合作，好經常性嘅檢討。如果有需要嗰陣時咧，我哋睇邊一方面咧係可以加強佢一個支援。呢個係大前提，亦都同呢一個咧，黑平谷主席同埋呢位誒呢個佢一個誒呢個秘書長咧係經常都有呢個交誒呢個溝通嘅。所以咧，正如頭先我主題有提到咧，我哋會不斷咧。

292
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:46,180
係呢個繼續咧，係同呢個哈蘋果咧係合作，佢係我哋策略性嘅夥伴。有需要嗰陣時候咧，我哋可以咧就各個項目裏邊咧係呢個係誒呢個支援嘅。多謝主席。

293
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,750
兩月鐘完。

294
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,600
主席。

295
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:59,960
今次考評局咧喺依個嘅海外考試入邊咧，係得到係七百幾萬嘅誒額外嘅盈餘咧，噉就用嚟咧就係畀依個嘅員工作為獎勵。

296
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:20,250
咁咧，其實咧，呢種做法咧係唔單止係冇為呢個本地收費本地考生嘅收考試收費咧而減低之外咧，仲造成好多唔公道嘅地方。就係因為咧，佢員工咧本身自己嚟講話咧，亦都有一個獎勵嘅計劃嘅。就係如果質素好，即係工作質素表現好嘅話咧，其實根本就已經有壓。

297
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:40,260
外嘅一個嘅獎獎賞嘅啦。咁而今次咧就係佢一個喺呢個獎賞之外咧，仲要加大碼加大碼之外咧，仲要係肥上瘦下。點解咧？有高層嘅管理階層咧就攞咗八萬蚊，而但係低層嗰啲咧攞得幾千蚊，甚至係啲合約員工咧係冇得攞嘅，因為佢話佢。

298
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:45,640
即係短時間之內就到期噉樣樣，噉嘅做法嘅話咧，係唔單止。

299
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:56,340
激勵唔到係員工嘅士氣，而對一啲本地考生未來嗰考試費用裏邊嚟講話咧，唔能夠留翻個基金去即係減低成本。所以問一問局長。

300
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:07,560
點解你會容許咁做？點解要容許考評局將依筆嘅盈餘咧，係作為一個額外嘅加大碼嘅獎賞畀員工，而將來？

301
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,300
考考評局會唔會繼續繼續咁做？

302
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:21,350
同時，將來有盈餘嘅話咧，會唔會留作係減輕本地考試考生嘅收費咧？局長。

303
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,460
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。

304
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,120
我哋咧要誒，要從一個。

305
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:39,970
事實根據嘅角度去了解今次呢個夏蘋果用七百萬做嘅呢個咧啊特別嘅獎勵畀員工呢個計劃。

306
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,620
呢個係一個一次性嘅一個獎勵計劃。

307
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,540
最主要咧，喺二零一零年到二零一一年。

308
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,620
考評局因為要應付呢一個失。

309
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,910
新高中、中學文憑試整個安排。

310
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,380
我親身感受到。

311
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,280
啲員工過去嗰兩年。

312
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,390
農曆新年假期都放唔到。

313
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,160
平時咧都要咧係。

314
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,550
十八小時以上嘅工作。

315
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:30,840
禮拜六、禮拜日停車場爆滿曬泊車，同事去做嘢。佢哋冇攞其他特別嘅資助，或者係呢個O.T.嘅補償。佢哋個目的只一個，成個考評局喺過去幾年只有一個呢個口頭嘅一個咧宗旨嘅使命嘅一個一個口頭説説語，就係英文叫做deliver。

316
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,320
with ply.

317
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,290
喺噉嘅大前提之下，留意到同事。

318
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:57,060
完全全程嘅投入，共奉獻咗喺整個事件上邊，睇到好多嘅呢一個流失量好高，百分之十三十四，只係整體個別部分咧三十四十。而咧嗰個軟件嘅發展啦，一啲課題嘅安排係好緊切嘅時間表，所以咧管理層。

319
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:17,070
咧作出一個建議，而經過曬咧整體嘅一個咧完全咧係正常嘅程序，由呢一個咧係人力資源管理委員會到呢一個咧財務委員會，經過各項分析，瞭解到咧啊呢個一個有效嘅方案，好多方案裏邊其中一個重要嘅係作為一個考慮。

320
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:37,080
況之下咧，喺二零一一年底咧，係由呢一個咧係呢個係啊委員會咧啊，夏平谷嘅委員會咧係發班話，我哋支持呢個，而要睇實際嘅發展情況去做呢個一次性。主席係一次性嘅呢一個誒呢一個係一個啊一個認可嘅一個一個一個手段嚟嘅喺呢個裏邊咧，佢都分兩期去發放。

321
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:57,090
目的咧就係咧，整體都知得到咧，為香港一個咁重要嘅一個改革係完成佢嘅使命咧，係作為一個咧象徵式嘅一個呢個補償，係一個認可，係一個讚賞，純粹呢個角度咧去做呢樣嘢。第二點重要嘅咧就係咧，佢嗰七百萬咧唔係嚟自我哋尊重。

322
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:10,570
嘅一部分，我哋呢個咧資助嘅一部分係嚟自咧佢咧特別努力咧喺其他嘅呢一個咧係專業嘅考試情況之下咧係賺取嘅額外個部其中一部分咧係攞出嚟噉樣用係一次性嘅。

323
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:30,860
再強調咧就係咧，佢其他嘅部分嘅活動唔係呢一個咧不務正業，希望議員咧真係要尊重佢哋嘅專業。好多嘅專業嘅考試都係咧，因為香港考評局嘅高度嘅專業水平得到國際嘅認可，好多嘅國際市喺其他地方冇進。

324
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:50,870
淨係嚟香港進行，就係代表咗對佢哋嗰個咧專業嘅呢個認可。呢啲事咧，好多香港嘅學生咧係都想考嘅。如果佢喺香港唔舉辦咧，佢要去飛去其他地方去考試。呢啲係其他地方現在咧嚟香港考呢啲特別嘅專業事。所以咧，佢哋並唔係一啲嘅咧一啲額外不務正業嘅。

325
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:54,070
係有實際需要嘅一啲嘅考試，多謝主席。

326
01:03:55,030 --> 01:04:15,040
冇答案問題，或者冇答案問題啊！誒，即係主席咧，我誒請你重複你嘅問題。好啊！誒，我哋唔係話唔尊重考評局嘅同事咧，出出咗咁多努力。我只想問，就喺未來咧有類似嗰啲嘅考試嘅嘅金額盈餘嘅話咧，會唔會留作翻？

327
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:22,980
畀一個嘅其他考試誒嘅費用咗做咧，以減輕個成本，而係唔使就係收費咁高啫。

328
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:27,330
局長，營業會唔會我哋降低嘅收費？

329
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:47,730
係，多謝主席。我嘅理解咧，考評局喺呢方面咧係已經係作出呢個誒一個決定嘅。喺年初嘅時候咧，佢點知諗住咧，來年度嘅考試費咧係唔會因為通脹而調整，就係咧係希望咧儘量降低嗰個考試嗰個誒收費嘅水平，係將呢一部。

330
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:59,970
份咧係協助香港嘅學生，唔需要咧受到通脹，需要畀額外嘅考試費。佢每一年都做檢討，依家我理解咧，佢已經凍結咗咧來年度嗰個考試費。多謝主席。田北辰議員。

331
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:23,260
主席，我都想跟進呢個七百萬呢個獎勵金嘅事項。正話聽阿局長講咧，係因為嗰一兩年咧啲流失率好犀利，噉就希望呢個獎勵金咧可以對呢方面作出啲貢獻。噉我諗諗，廉署嘅流失率都好高啦，噉。

332
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:31,910
噉係咪應該佢哋又要發放獎勵金咧？咁好多政府部門有呢個問題㗎。咁所以咧就想問下啦，誒局長。

333
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:33,910
噉你誒？

334
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:54,590
喺考評局發放獎金之前同獎金之後嘅流失率，你有冇要求佢哋交啲數畀你睇？睇下到底佢呢個七百萬花咗啊，有冇任何嘅成效咧？咁如果冇嘅話，你有冇覺得啊？監管方面嘅力度咧，就？

335
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:56,910
不足，稍為欠奉咧。

336
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,560
局長。

337
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:18,740
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。我都有留意到咧呢一部分嘅情況。我舉一個例咧，二零零九到二零一零年，佢整體嘅呢一個流失率係百分之八點三到十點九。二零一三年頭嗰九個月咧係八點一。

338
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:39,030
呢個咧係一個咧高峯期咧係落咗去嘅，呢個係重要嘅一個數字，因為特別裏邊咧個別嘅部分啦，我哋特別留意咧佢一啲嘅誒科目呢個特別科目嘅呢個誒委員會裏邊嘅公職人員誒呢個職職員啦，同埋咧佢一啲軟件嘅。

339
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:47,450
員工咧都留翻喺度咧，係作呢一個噉樣嘅貢獻，所以咧答翻議員嘅題目咧，佢係真係噉樣樣落翻嚟嘅。多謝主席。

340
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,240
六位國員。

341
01:06:52,380 --> 01:07:12,390
主席就我就留意到誒，今次答案裏邊附交嘅資料咧，就係最近呢幾年嘅大型一啲嘅公安考試嗰個考試費嘅收入同埋開支咧，雖然都係有正有負，但係大致上咧係應該都係平衡嘅。咁裏邊咧係。

342
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:32,400
比較特別嘅，其實頭先嘅問誒問答裏邊咧都有顯出咧，就係有幾個特別嘅情況，譬如話誒最後嘅香港公開程度會考咁方面，當然需要一啲額外嘅資源。咁呢個咧，本會咧以往亦都有過一啲非經常性嘅撥款，所以我就睇唔到咧呢種模式之下咧呢。

343
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:52,410
個考評局嘅運作不能持續嘅情況，噉啊，不過我哋想問局長咧，就除咗話個即係收支平衡，除咗話咧有需要嘅考生係獲得資助以外咧，我哋都係咪都應該可以評比一下同香港生活水平相若嘅鄰近城市？

344
01:07:52,410 --> 01:08:12,420
佢哋嘅公開考試費用究竟係大約點樣樣咧？就喺呢個係咪可以作為一個客觀嘅印證？係香港呢啲公開試嘅收費係唔係一個即係合理嘅水平？如果假如局長今日提交唔到資料，會唔會喺誒會後咧喺提交到呢一方面嘅資料咧？又或者可能考評局？

345
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,820
過往都曾經做過呢啲評比都唔定啊，主席、局長。

346
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:36,950
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。啊，我哋會有呢啲數據嘅。我嘅理解咧，考翻呢個要入大學嘅試，香港嘅收費咧係平過考GCE A Level入大學嘅試好多嘅。作一個例子，不過咧，我會稍後咧係書面回答議員，提供多啲呢方面嘅資料。多謝。

347
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:37,420
主席。

348
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,890
國家企業。

349
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:45,530
主席，頭先聽完啊，局長講咧，就其實最應該加人工啲政治助理，因為走到不得了嘅。

350
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:57,310
噉我啊想問一問局長，嗱，而家新生學子咧就相當之慘嘅，要負擔極高嘅費用。你有冇覺得你當年仲喺考評局嘅時候做咗個決定咧？

351
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,830
係分花紅呢個做法咧？

352
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:16,120
係唔應該去做，因為事實上噉樣咧係做咗一個好壞嘅先例，不但只令到考試費嘅增加有壓力，亦都喺公共機構入邊咧做一個好壞嘅榜樣，呢個係不得，即係要不得，都係絕情。局長。

353
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:21,990
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。

354
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:42,710
我喺考評局裏邊咧，最後討論呢個咧，係之前一個月嚟開，但係真正喺呢個委員會討論而作出咧，係會係接納原則上接納，用呢個或者其他形式去呢個咧，係係認可同事嘅貢獻，同埋咧係呢個咧應付。

355
01:09:42,710 --> 01:10:02,720
流失率呢個咧係二零一一年年底嘅呢一個委員會上面嘅會議，我冇直接參與咧喺二零一二年咧誒八月裏邊咧，根據實質嘅一啲客觀嘅資料，然後咧決定咗咧佢哋嗰個貢獻嘅實質嘅表現，而咧作出裏邊咧係分誒呢個分花誒呢個咧。

356
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:15,850
咧論功行賞嘅呢一個誒誒呢一個措施，同埋佢點樣嘅分佈呢部分咧，主席我係冇參與嘅，因為我離開嗰陣時咧，七月一號已經離開咗，而佢所喺入邊咧，佢都根據咧。

357
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:36,320
人力資源委員會、財務委員會、策略發展委員會同埋整個考評嗰個委員會嘅討論咧，係而作出嘅。呢個咧，我好清楚咧，佢哋咧係跟足曬程序去做，我就唔會直接參與到咧，主席佢整個過程裏邊。所以咧，我就答唔到議員咧呢方面，只係答得到咧二零一。

358
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:56,330
一年底委員會上邊咧，知道管理層知道員工遇到嘅問題，而咧大家討論咧係用呢個咧啊，根據呢一個特別嘅一個一一一次性嘅一個鼓勵嘅措施，或者其他可以考慮嘅方法嗰陣時咧，我作出咗咧支持原則上係支持呢個噉嘅議案。

359
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:04,690
多謝主席。呢項質詢咧用咗二十四分鐘啦，對唔住啊，郭議員，你如果要跟進咧，請你喺其他嘅途徑。第四項質詢林大輝議員。

360
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:05,930
好，主席。

361
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:22,780
主席，據報本月有大批跨境學童嘅家長到北區同埋屯門等地區嘅幼稚園門外通宵排隊輪候入學申請表格，因並因而顯生出中介人代家長排隊嘅情況。

362
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:33,040
部分內地家長批評有關嘅幼稚園安排失當，而本地嘅家長則遊行抗議跨境學童影響本地學童入讀就近幼稚園嘅機會。

363
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:53,330
此外，由於龍年效應，二零一二年喺本港出生嘅嬰兒較其他年份為多，而佢哋明年會報讀後年入學嘅幼稚園，有香港家長因而憂慮明年嘅幼稚園學額競爭情況較今年更為激烈。就此，政府可否告知本會一？

364
01:11:53,480 --> 01:12:13,490
過去五年，每年本地及國際學校嘅幼稚園分班按區議會分區劃分嘅數目，該等幼稚園分別提供嘅幼兒班、低班同埋高班嘅學額，以及申請人入讀同埋錄獲錄取嘅跨境學童人數分別為何？

365
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:22,460
二有否推算未來五年全港嘅幼住院學額需求，以及當中跨境學童所佔嘅數目？

366
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,780
如有有關個數字。

367
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:31,690
同推算方法嘅詳情為何？如否？原因為何？及三。

368
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:51,980
鑑於教育局局長喺本年十月七日曾公開表示，幼稚園可以運用空置嘅課室，靈活提供各級嘅學額。政府估計喺二零一四至二零一五學年，北區、屯門、元朗同埋大埔分別有多少間幼稚園可透過？

369
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,880
此方式提供額外嘅學額。

370
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,410
以及每區運用空置嘅課室，靈活提供嘅學額。

371
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:07,580
當局預計喺二零一四至一五年學年，該等地區分別會錄取嘅跨境學童人數為何？

372
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,060
交通局局長。

373
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,170
多謝主席。

374
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,960
就林議員嘅提問，我嘅答覆如下。

375
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:26,150
第一條問題喺過去五年，即係二零零八零九年到二零一二一三嘅學年。

376
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:31,620
按分區劃分嘅本地同埋非本地幼稚園嘅數目。

377
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:39,280
按分區同埋級別劃分嘅本地同埋非本地幼稚園學生嘅人數同埋學額。

378
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:50,810
以及咧按地區劃分嘅跨境幼稚園學生嘅數目，分別咧長列喺附表一、二同埋三，我喺呢度咧唔再重複。

379
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:57,700
香港嘅幼稚園，包括呢個幼稚園暨幼兒中心，全屬私營。

380
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:06,570
家長可以按個別嘅需要申請報讀一所或者多所適合佢子女嘅幼稚園。

381
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:11,600
幼稚園取錄學生方面係屬於校本嘅決定。

382
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:20,260
我哋並冇申請入學幼稚園人數嘅資料，包括咧有幾多申請人係跨境學童。

383
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:32,470
第二條問題喺推算香港整體幼稚園學額嘅需求嘅時候，我哋會考慮嘅因素係有相當多嘅方面。

384
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,640
包括一。

385
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:40,220
已經喺幼稚園就讀嘅學生，包括呢個跨境學童嘅人數。

386
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:59,350
第二學齡人口嘅推算數字，呢啲數字係根據香港統計、香港政府統計處不時更新嘅人口推算同埋最新嘅人口變化，包括咧內地新來港兒童人數而編制，係不斷噉樣即時嘅更新。

387
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:07,390
第三，不同年齡嘅幼童喺就讀幼稚園入學嘅比率，同埋佢最新嘅趨勢。

388
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:13,600
最後重要嘅地方就係跨境合作嘅估計嘅數字。

389
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:20,050
喺上述各項之中，人口推算涉及多項因素同埋假設。

390
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,760
當中亦都係有關內地婦女喺香港所生兒子嘅假設。

391
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:29,710
對於推算結果嘅影響，尤其重要。

392
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:37,130
但係呢啲嬰兒來港定居嘅實際數目同埋時間，都好難咧，係準確噉樣樣去預測。

393
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:49,560
至於跨境學童嘅數字，係因應佢家庭嘅因素、居住地點嘅分佈、相關政策嘅調整等等，年與年之間係都有差異嘅。

394
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,670
因此，亦都唔可能咧，係準確噉樣去預測。

395
01:15:54,020 --> 01:16:12,520
基於呢啲嘅限制，我哋一向喺教育局每一年嘅管制人員報告裏邊咧，係只會預測咧來年度幼稚園學生嘅人數。至於整體幼稚園學額需求嘅長遠推算，我哋認為只係適宜作內部嘅參考。

396
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:33,270
鑑於公眾對呢個幼稚園學額嘅關切同埋關注，我哋喺較早嘅時間啦，特別係就二零一四一五年度學年嘅幼稚園整體學額需求作出一個預測，大約係十六萬八千個，而估計鄰邊。

397
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:43,150
邊四個地區？呢個誒邊境四個地區，二零一四一五年學年嘅三至五歲學童，包括跨境兒童嘅數目。

398
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:59,330
喺附表四裏邊，呢啲預測都係參考咗二零一二一三年度啊，實際幼稚園學生嘅人數，並已考慮到咧香港就讀幼稚園嘅跨境學童數目同埋按年遞增嘅狀況。

399
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:16,760
今年稍後嘅時間，我哋當我哋掌握咗二零一三一四年度幼稚園學生嘅實際數字，我哋就可以準確噉樣樣，更加準確噉樣樣去預計估計咧，二零一四一五年度呢個學年咧幼稚園整體學額嘅需求。

400
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:18,850
第三條問題。

401
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:40,030
教育局係會密切留意各區幼稚園學額嘅供求情況。如果有需要咧，增加學額嘅供應，我哋都會要求咧幼稚園係儘量利用校舍空間去增加課室，鼓勵幼稚園充分使用已經註冊嘅班房收生，例如重新使。

402
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:57,030
使用二時空置嘅課室，亦都同辦學團體商討咧，鼓勵辦學團體咧到有學位需求嘅地區擴充或者開辦幼稚園。而家已經有辦學團體響應教育局嘅呼籲，喺二零一四一五年度咧喺北區開辦新嘅幼稚園。

403
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:17,320
二零一二一三年度嘅北區、屯門、元朗同埋大埔嘅空置課室，可以提供嘅五千二百個學額，涉及大約係六十所嘅幼稚園，詳情咧都喺附表五裏邊。至於一四一五年學年嘅預計空置課室同埋我提供嘅學額數目，需要咧今年稍後時間我掌握到。

404
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:23,970
二零一三一四年嘅幼稚園學生學額嘅實際數字咧，先至可以作出準確嘅估算。

405
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:44,260
北區、屯門、元朗同埋大埔二零一四一五年度三至五歲年齡組合嘅人口，包括跨境學童在內嘅預測數字，已經喺附表四。由於本局已經公佈咗一四一五年度咧，大埔同埋北區實行咗六項嘅幼稚園收生特別措施，而家咧比較難估計咧喺特別措施。

406
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,480
之下咧，最終有幾多跨境學童會係被取錄？多謝主席。

407
01:18:48,970 --> 01:19:08,980
林大輝議員，主席有大批家長咧喺街頭通宵排隊輪候呢個入入學表格。國長竟然話係正常嘅行為，所以思想影響行為。所以國長一開始就唔知呢件事太嚴重，掉以輕心，只係搬出一大堆似是而非嘅數字，希望就安撫家長，冇嘅實際行動，直至到有幾百個家。

408
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:28,990
長啦，上街遊行示威，你先知道大事不妙。咁到嗰時就如夢初醒，恍然大悟，見步行步急就將推出你所謂嘅六大措施，以為噉樣就可以得到完滿嘅解決。你話得唔得？梗係唔得啦，因為家長已經講明係唔信你同對你冇信心啊。主席，我個問題就係點咧？嗱，今日阿局長回答。

409
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:49,000
個問題咧有個非常之唔正常嘅現象啊，就係出現咗。佢話均難以準確預測，不可能準確預測，誒，稍後才可作出較準確嘅估算，現時很難估計。咁知唔知答咩啊？咁主席，所以我問呢個問題其實好簡單，亦都係根本性嘅問題。嗱，如果政府想挽回家長對你嘅，

410
01:19:49,000 --> 01:20:09,010
信心同埋妥善安排呢件事情，局長可唔可以斬釘截鐵、實牙實齒、直截了當向家長作出個承諾，百分百嘅保證。如果佢哋喺園區或者就近嘅學校報讀咗，政府一定係會保證佢可以喺園區或者就近嘅學校咧，誒得到個學位有書讀。我相信。

411
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:14,280
只係來者不拒，咁政府咧先可以令到家長放心嘅啫，局長。

412
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,580
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。

413
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:22,160
睇翻過去幾年嘅發展。

414
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:37,110
睇翻最近由呢一個九月底到十月初開始，特別係十月二號開始到十月十二號期間，裏邊咧嗰個排隊潮、嗰個咧恐慌程度係睇到嘅。

415
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:52,400
如果你睇翻喺北區作為一個重災區嚟講，主要咧報章報導七八日係報其中一間幼稚園嘅情況，大約咧如果超過兩日喺報章上邊報導嘅幼稚園，大約係四間。

416
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:59,740
呢個咧在在睇得到咧，我哋都話其他地區咧基本上咧供求可以應付，北區咧係比較緊張。

417
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:20,030
今年嘅問題咧，突發嘅情況有兩個現象出現。主席去年咧都有個別情況咧，都好有疊聚噉樣去排隊喺去年嗰時候咧，同啲誒幼稚園相討嘅時候咧，因為雖然係私營，我哋都有好多嘅討論，佢哋好多咧都話咧係特別今年年初咧已經諗定咧係喺個派表。

418
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:40,040
派申請表過程裏邊咧，做多啲功夫，呢個就係佢哋處理咗嘅。我親身探探訪裏邊嘅幼稚園，佢話畀我聽咧，今年係採用咗呢個網上呢一個收表咧，係真係湊效。一個朝頭早咧，一開始排隊，跟住咧就已經個隊就唔見咗，跟住咧就喺呢個網上咧移收。

419
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:47,360
三百個登記即刻出現咗，呢個咧就係在在睇得到咧。一遇到突發嘅情況嗰時咧，我哋即時去反應。

420
01:21:47,670 --> 01:22:07,680
大家議員都希望瞭解喺呢一個北區裏邊咧，係誒連埋大埔區有六十幾有成七十一間幼稚園喺我哋呢個月裏邊咧，已經開咗三次嘅會，大家即時咧係羣策羣力去處理有關嘅問題。喺短短十幾日之內咧，係呢個大家覺得咧係六個措。

421
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:27,690
師咧係大家一齊去共識推到出嚟，呢個咧就係在在我哋咧係呢個即時咧突發都好啦，都希望咧即時咧處理有關嘅問題。我哋咧發覺咧今次呢個效果係相當好，呢個好唔係話咧政府指定係要點樣做，因為再強調咧係私營性質，但係咧亦都係瞭解到咧業界咧。

422
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:47,700
咧係好關心呢個問題，所以咁短時間之內咧，佢哋即時咧係決定咧係一啲共通嘅六個措施。六個措施裏邊咧，我特別要強調一點好重要嘅。呢個過往一路都有呢個問題。如果同家長講，我琴晚都見啲家長，之前我都見咗唔同嘅家長嘅小組，都講得好清楚。我最擔心嘅咧就係冇。

423
01:22:47,700 --> 01:23:07,710
位於是乎咧，我哋報咧四五個、六七個，好明白點解要咁做。但係以往嘅情況咧，就係喺九月、十月報咗，等到來年嘅八九月，有啲仲未攞到，因為咧有個別家長可能仲係咧hold住咗啲位唔放。呢個就最大嘅問題。你點樣嘅測試、測算都冇用，所以咧。

424
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:27,720
咧今年用咗咧一學生一學位噉嘅安排之後咧，將嗰個時間縮短咗，唔需要等十個月嘅時間去去煎熬。係咧十月十二月一完咗咧，我哋有個統一嘅呢一個係登記日，跟住二月咧統一嘅註冊日，就鼓勵大家咧一個學生一個學位。

425
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:47,730
噉啊！之後咧，希望咧喺二三月裏邊咧，已經大部分嘅位咧能夠分派到出嚟，係將以往咧需要十個月嘅煎熬咧，係就係呢個減減嘅出嚟。呢個咧在在咧就係咧，當遇到有突發嘅情況，我哋即時喺呢個變動。我再強調咧，就係喺呢個統計數字裏邊咧，我哋係瞭解係明白，所以。

426
01:23:47,730 --> 01:24:07,740
咧喺十月三號、四號，當我一開始咗第一次嘅會議嘅時候咧，我咧特別強調咧就係明白咧北區作為一個例子，係四千五同埋四千四嘅對比得個一百個位推算上邊嚟講，我哋覺得咧係好緊張嘅，所以咧已經即時咧同個別學校咧係同大家商量，可唔可以？

427
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:27,750
考慮咧喺呢方面咧做一個咧係啊兩手準備嘅安排。結果咧，大家真我真係要多謝啲幼稚園嘅嘅負責人。短短嘅時間之內咧，已經有五間嘅幼稚園咧係表達到咧佢哋願意咧係呢個係續嘅安排咧考慮交位，但係佢唔可以即時話到畀大家聽，因為咧佢要同。

428
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:47,760
呢個咧，自己嘅校董會去聯絡佢，即係喺實際嘅情況同我哋同事繼續商討。過去嗰一個月裏邊咧，我哋已經開咗三次會。另外有啲國別校咧係響應我哋嘅呼籲，譬如咧喺呢一個北區，就已經起碼有一間學校咧係覺得需要咧建一間新嘅學校。阿局長，由於正話議員嘅提問咧係作咗。

429
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,540
啲。

430
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:56,300
誒批評，所以我理解咧，就局長係回應議員批評，但係議員亦都係提出係要求局長咧。

431
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:04,340
斬釘截鐵、實牙實齒、直接了當，係作一啲承諾。局長會唔會回應呢方面？主席你好英明啊！主席。

432
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,370
多謝多謝主席嘅提示。

433
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:11,200
我只喺度能夠講嘅咧，就係以北區為例。

434
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,100
琴日七十一間幼稚園，六十五個代表出席咗。

435
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:20,980
大家對咧呢個咧就近上學嘅原則，大家係絕對贊成同埋支持。

436
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:28,230
咁亦都有校長同我講句話咧，局長，你話叫我保證畀位你，你可唔可以保證咧？我畀咗位佢一定翻嚟。

437
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:47,520
以往嘅問題咧嘅情況，大家係相相對比嘅。有啲學校就話咧，我畀曬位出嚟，最後一分鐘咧有一半有三分一冇出席嘅，所以咧呢個亦都係雙方邊要考慮嘅選擇問題喺個大前提裏邊咧，大部分嘅校長同我講就話咧，局長，我哋都希望收翻同村。

438
01:25:48,040 --> 01:26:08,050
附近嘅學生，因為咧喺教啊、學習啊、家校合作咧，都會比較好嘅。呢個咧，佢可以好肯定。甚至乎個別情況，如果個別家長話：我到時間都未有位，校長就話咧，你叫佢揾我，我盡量安排等等。呢個咧係我能夠做得到。我之所以唔能夠話咧百分之一百保證，因為咧仍然我要尊重咧。

439
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:12,360
係呢個咧，幼稚園咧係私辦性質，係大家嘅合作。多謝主席。

440
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:30,810
莫國興議員，誒林大輝議員，主席，我想我諗佢又唔清楚你問題，亦都唔清楚我問題，所以我充份問題。誒，你認為局長唔夠斬釘截鐵？唔係，除咗唔夠斬釘截鐵、直截了當之外，我要保證同承諾，佢知嘅答案會唔會保證，會唔會承諾得㗎啦？誒。

441
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:38,170
我認為局長咧已經答咗你嘅問題，即係佢答咗係冇唔承諾就唔保證啊。局長有冇咩補充？

442
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:59,410
我要答或承諾好容易，各位議員主席，但係咧，我要瞭解到實際嘅情況。即係唔即係唔能夠保證。我只能夠話咧，我相信我有信心咧，喺呢個同學，特別係呢一個咧原誒呢個就近上學呢個原則咧，我相信咧大部分嘅同學咧應該可以咧攞到自己喺呢。

443
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:09,610
個咧係誒就近上學呢一個噉樣樣嘅安排。如果有特別嘅問題嗰陣時候咧，校長同埋我哋分區嘅同事咧，係會咧全力咧去支持佢哋。

444
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,970
我講嘢。

445
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:13,070
多謝主席。

446
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:26,630
主席，跨境學童嘅問題咧就由來已久，而且咧越嚟越犀利。咁咧就，我想透過你咧就係問局長，局長你會唔會？

447
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:31,740
有冇計劃嚟去咧？去同呢個深圳。

448
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:52,030
方面咧嚟去商討，誒推動、誒鼓勵又好，或者係促進又好，誒辦學團體或者咧係內地嘅政府部門係喺內地設立呢個港人嘅學校，包括幼稚園誒以至小學等。

449
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:52,670
嘅。

450
01:27:52,950 --> 01:28:05,670
等等嘅級別，令到咧啲同學咧唔使跨境就學，咁從呢個根本上面咧嚟去解決呢個問題，你會唔會噉樣做？噉啊考慮咧，局長。

451
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:27,190
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅提問。呢幾年裏邊咧，我哋都係做咗幾個實驗計劃，係試辦睇緊佢一個功能嘅發展，包括咧港人子弟學校有兩間喺深圳，同埋四個咧港人子弟班等等，亦都瞭解到咧，唔單止淨喺深圳喺上海啊、北京都。

452
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:47,200
都有，亦都有香港人去辦嘅一啲幼稚園，呢個亦都有發生。我哋咧亦都係開始同呢一個深圳教育局咧係聯絡同埋接觸，睇下咩方法同埋咧係多啲瞭解實際上面嘅需要。我想同大家報告一下咧，其實喺我哋呢段時間裏邊咧，我哋都做咗好多功夫。大前提咧就話。

453
01:28:47,200 --> 01:29:07,210
咧，究竟有幾多人係想讀啲乜嘢嘅課程？我哋問咗嘅早翻，我哋有計劃咧諗過，大有百有有萬個大致上嘅呢個跨境父母，但係真正攞到資料嘅咧，得個一千個都唔夠，因為佢哋好多咧就係唔提供呢啲資料，所以咧我哋都小心咧喺呢個數據上面咧係做分析啊。

454
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:27,220
啊！亦都同呢一個深入兼緊咧，就話咧，如果係香港個別嘅團體願意喺做咧國際學校形式去做咧，佢哋現在嘅安排仲有喺度嘅。咁所以咧，一睇緊咧嗰兩個實現計劃裏邊嘅一路嘅發展；第二咧，亦都睇緊咧其他特別嘅需要嘅情況，同埋現在嘅安排係點樣樣。多謝主席，陳志全。

455
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,820
你。

456
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:48,290
主席，跨境學同通宵排隊搶奪北區學位呢個問題咧，好多家長非常之關心、十分關注，但係佢哋就覺得政府係唔關心，或者講係後知後覺。頭先局長嘅答案咧，其實就係噉話畀阿林大飛議員聽嘅：幼稚園其實一盤生意嚟嘅，即係私營嘅，啊收生就學校決定嘅。咁當然。

457
01:29:48,290 --> 01:30:08,300
你鼓勵佢有位就收多啲，開多啲啦。喂，局長唔使你搞佢做生意啊，即係佢有位有心有力，佢實會收多啲學生嘅。我嘅問題係咧，有馬鞍山嘅街坊向我反映咧，佢哋嘅社區嘅幼稚園咧都開始有呢啲跨境學童咧要爭位啦。嗱，局長你頭先話大埔同北區咧就採取咗六項嘅收生措施啦，包括有就

458
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:28,310
附近入學嘅優先取錄政策，咁大家好想知呢個政策其實真係落實嘅時候係點樣落實咧？嗱，假定你係落實到即係話北區同大埔都係做到啦，咁會唔會就變成將個問題乾坤大難移噉樣咧？就沿住火車軌線推咗落去馬鞍山，即係令到咧。

459
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:38,950
沙田馬鞍山嗰啲又開始咧，有啲跨境學童去爭位啦。呢個你點樣去回應？點樣去令到其他沿鐵路社區嘅家長可以釋懷咧？局長。

460
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,670
啊，多謝英及錦文。

461
01:30:41,950 --> 01:31:01,960
首先咧就係六個措施咧，喺琴晚嘅家長會裏邊咧，我哋都特別咧啱啱同呢一個六十五間幼稚園嘅代表傾咗一啲實質嘅推行情況，都講埋出嚟。我哋會預計咧十月初咧就會安排一啲嘅家長嘅推介會，詳細羅列。

462
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:21,970
亦都將一啲資料咧係印冊一啲嘅一啲嘅單張係話畀啲家長聽，整個過程接觸層面，我哋都會考慮咧係用呢個熱線同埋咧係同同我哋接觸。凡此種種咧都希望咧盡量將嗰個措施嘅實質嘅情況咧係推廣，亦都盡量盡早攞家長個別嘅一啲意見。

463
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:32,790
一啲細節上面一啲嘅問題，係作出嚟咧係安排，所以咧我哋都好有信心咧，係大家羣策羣力出嚟嘅咧，係應該完全咧係推動到呢個第一點。

464
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:53,080
第二咧，呢個措施成與敗咧，係咪整體整體嘅幼稚園咧一齊合作去做？我喺之前都有講過，就係咧其他區裏邊咧，如果啲校長會佢哋覺得咧整體佢哋可以咁做嗰陣咧，我哋好樂意同佢哋咧係繼續商討呢啲措施嘅部分。譬如其中一區我哋商量緊啦，佢哋咧六個。

465
01:31:53,080 --> 01:32:13,090
措施裏邊咧，佢哋有四個咧覺得係好嘅，所以咧佢哋嗰啲主動咧係贊成推行嗰四個，另外嗰兩個咧佢哋會考慮一下先有冇需要去推。呢個咧其他區裏邊咧嘅情況，我哋好希望咧，如果係能夠行得到，能夠幫得到過程裏邊嘅措施，如果大家嗰啲應該要做嘅時候咧，我哋一定咧會盡量去支持。但係咧嗰啲各，

466
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:32,340
別嘅條件嗰部分咧，因為都係新嘅措施咧，我哋希望盡快能夠將佢咧係做到出嚟咧，係攞到經驗咧，將佢優化兼埋。多謝主席。主席佢冇答到我個問題啊！我即係話，如果你嘅措施喺大埔同北區係收效，咁會唔會將啲學生跨境學生接咗落去沙田？咁到時你又話將嗰六個措施又去到沙田做，跟住一路接落去？

467
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:41,830
佢冇答到呢個問題。啊，局長，對於其他區可能受影響，政府有冇啲乜嘢準備？係多謝多謝主席，多謝議員。

468
01:32:42,140 --> 01:33:02,150
我哋睇到咧，就係呢個跨境學童佢嘅行為咧，唔係一個咧係方程式噉樣去處理。事實上邊嚟講咧，而家你睇到咧，報紙都有賣好多嘅跨境學童咧，未有呢個問題之前咧，都要去唔同嘅區。所以咧，你話咧，會唔會擔心咧？佢會咧係誒？

469
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:22,160
誒誒會流失咗人，即係超入咗去其他地方噉樣樣咧。我睇第一就係北區四個區裏邊咧，又特別除咗係呢個北區比較緊張咧，其他區咧仲有相當嘅呢個空額喺度。咁所以咧應該預計得到佢嘅數咧，係永遠都比本地嘅學童嘅人口比較大嘅。呢個有另外一個特別嘅地方。其他區裏邊咧。

470
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:42,170
亦都係好主動咧去呢個咧係呢個招收有關嘅呢個跨區學童，所以幾容易一齊發生。有時咧一個跨區學童去到馬鞍山其他咧，未必因為咧佢喺呢個北區冇，而係咧就特別心儀嘅個別學校咧都係佢選擇之一。一個家長可能揀幾間學校，呢個都係一個情況。不過我哋。

471
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:42,570
係。

472
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:46,190
誒呢項質詢咧，已經用咗。

473
01:33:46,830 --> 01:34:06,840
差唔多二十三分鐘，誒，除咗提出主體質詢嘅議員之外咧，只係得兩位其他嘅議員咧係有機會提出呢個補充質詢，所以我想提醒誒官員回答議員問題嘅時候咧，希望係避免提述同問題冇。

474
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:18,280
冇直接關係嘅事項，亦都請議員提問嘅時候咧，係避免發表評論，否則咧，我係好難唔畀官員咧就你發表嘅評論咧作回應嘅。

475
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,190
第五項質詢，梁耀忠議員。

476
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,120
主席。

477
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:40,700
近年咧，每當立法會議員辯論同埋表決重要嘅議案或者法案時咧，政府往往都會派遣一啲公職人員喺立法會綜合大樓嘅咧各個主要通道同埋出口駐守。就此，政府可否告知本會？

478
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:41,960
第一。

479
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:48,140
作出上述嘅安排嘅原因，以及該等公職人員嘅具體職責為何？

480
01:34:48,420 --> 01:35:08,430
第二，上述安排每次涉及嘅公職人員嘅數目、佢哋嘅職級以及該等人員嘅執行該項職務嘅期間嘅薪酬開支為何？及第三，有否檢討作出該項安排是否有實際需要？而有檢討所採取嘅準則為何？而檢討結果唯有。

481
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:17,580
需要那個部門同埋職級嘅人員咧，就該項安排作決定，會否考慮不再作出該項嘅安排？

482
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,500
公共事務局局長。

483
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:24,980
主席就梁耀忠議員嘅提問，我而家綜合回覆。

484
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:45,360
誒，政府非常尊重立法會制定法律、監管公共開支同埋監察政府工作嘅職能。各司局長咧，不時都會親自嚟到立法會向議員介紹同埋解釋政府嘅政策，參與同政府議案或者法律取案嘅討論，同埋處理各項同立法會有關嘅事務。

485
01:35:45,670 --> 01:36:05,680
喺呢一方面咧，其他嘅政府公職人員，包括其他政治委任嘅官員同埋公務員咧，亦都不時需要協助同埋支援各司局長。具體嘅工作咧，包括協助佢哋同相關嘅議員取得聯絡，瞭解議員嘅意見，關注佢哋嘅投票取向。喺需要嘅時候咧，向議員作出。

486
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:22,700
詳盡嘅解釋，同埋提供進一步嘅資料，同埋掌握立法會以會議進行嘅情況嘅第一手資料，包括相關討論嘅內容、議員整體出席同埋投票進行嘅情況等。然後咧係向有關嘅司局長係彙報。

487
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:42,990
協助司局長處理立法會事務係政府公職人員嘅職責嘅一部分。如果有關嘅人員履行呢啲職務嘅時候，需要喺立法會要進行嘅期間進出立法會大樓，佢哋均會採取非常謹慎嘅態度，亦都嚴格遵守大樓嘅嘅規則。

488
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:51,170
保咧唔會影響或者妨礙立法會會議嘅進行，同埋議員或者其他使用立法會大樓嘅公眾人士。

489
01:36:51,640 --> 01:37:11,650
由於各立法會事務嘅性質，需所所需嘅時間同埋涉及嘅程序各有不同，政策局或者部門咧會因應佢哋嘅個別嘅情況同埋實際需要，安排適切數目或者職級或及職級嘅人員咧係執行支援嘅工作，所以咧我哋未能夠提供上述安排。

490
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:24,870
所涉及嘅人手數目、職級同埋薪酬嘅概括數字，依然咧有關嘅工作只係涉及各政策局或者部門嘅現有人手同埋資源，並冇其他嘅額外開支。

491
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:45,400
各司局長咧，每一次需要處理重要嘅立法會事務嘅時候咧，有關嘅政策局或者部門嘅高層咧，會按個別嘅情況衡量同埋考慮是否需要提供支援，亦都作出有關人手嘅調配。由於需要處理嘅立法會事務各有不同咧，各個政策局同埋部，

492
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,970
們咧會各自作出相應嘅部署。

493
01:37:48,280 --> 01:38:06,170
我哋會不時檢討就處理重要立法會事務所需作出嘅人手支援。如果發現某一方面嘅安排需要調整，我哋會作出相應嘅調動，務求能更加適切咁處理各項與同立法會有關嘅事務。多謝主席。李宇忠議。

494
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:20,060
主席，個長根本係迴避問題咧，係冇膽量咁正面回答我哋，就去派出呢啲公職人員咧，其實根本就係俗稱嘅狗仔隊，就係監視我哋議員咧係出席一會議或者離開一會議室嘅。

495
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:40,370
依個做法裏邊嚟講話咧，對我哋議員嚟講係實在帶嚟一個係好唔舒服，因為事實上咧佢好似監視住我哋議員嘅出席情況。依個做法咧，我覺得係唔知點解政府需要咁做，亦都唔係好似頭先局長所講咧，佢啲公職人員咧係去遊説或者解釋政府立場嘅，係只不過係監。

496
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:45,060
持住我哋嘅啫，所以我想問一問政府，其實。

497
01:38:46,440 --> 01:39:06,450
你剛才所講嘅遊説或者係瞭解我哋投票嘅情況，同呢一個監察有咩嘅關係咧？度咧，你會唔會係停止噉嘅做法？同埋咧，如果你唔會停止嘅話咧，如果繼續有噉嘅做法嘅時候咧，你會唔會尊重我哋立法會議會？因為呢一粒議會咧。

498
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:16,240
係獨立嘅，唔係你哋嘅政府嘅範圍之內，會唔會諮詢我哋主席或者諮詢我哋議員先，然後先作出呢個決定，採取呢個措施咧？

499
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:36,950
局長啊，主席就有兩議員所提嘅提問咧，有有點我哋想解釋翻咧，就算嗰個支援嘅工作咧，呢啲同事啊支援司局長嘅工作咧，係包括各方面嘅，包括譬如話同議員再詳細解釋嗰個有關嘅議案啊噉樣。當然亦都要留意翻啊，即係嗰個投票嘅情況。

500
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:56,960
亦都確保，譬如話，我哋需要啊，有啲需要支持我哋嘅議員啊，嗰個投票嘅情況啊，呢個需要去做個彙報。噉佢佢哋所做嘅工作咧，其實係唔會影響到議員嗰個情況嘅。啊，咁至於我哋啊，同時進入呢個立法會咧，我哋當然一定係同秘書處係係獲得呢個。

501
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:03,590
即係嗰個許可證先可以進入，亦都會嚴格咁遵守立法會大樓裏裏邊嘅規則。

502
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:25,040
李卓仁議員，誒梁議員冇答你問題。局長完全冇答我問題嘅，係迴避問題嘅。清楚講出你問題。我想問清楚，即係再次重新個問題咧，就係我問局長，究竟你如果再做一手咧，會唔會係諮詢我哋立法會議員，同埋特別係主席閣下，同埋咧我哋個行管會嘅？

503
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:32,580
因為咧，依個立法會大樓咧係我哋屬於係立法會嘅，唔係政府話要入咧你就入咧你嘅，而家要你係攞個證咧。

504
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:44,630
個證有冇係知有冇講明清楚入你嘅目的係邊嘢乜嘢咧？係揾邊個人咧？因為我哋所有嘅人咧入親嚟依個立法會咧，都係見邊個人。我相信你重複咗你嘅問題啦。

505
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:52,170
局長，啊，主席，我重新就係我哋所有政策局或者部門嘅同事。

506
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:58,180
進出入呢個立法會大樓咧，係獲得呢個立法會秘書處嘅許可證先進入呢個大樓嘅。

507
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:07,130
李卓，誒，答我問題喎。阿梁耀榮，我認為咧，局長係答咗你嘅問題，但係你唔滿意局長嘅答覆，你認為？

508
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:16,240
政府方面呢個做法，你覺得誒唔恰當嘅話咧，請你喺其他途徑去跟進。你上月。

509
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:36,560
嗯，其實咧，即係頭先阿梁耀忠議員話係即係監視啲議員咧，佢從來冇監視我哋嘅，佢就係監視建制派嘅啫。佢從來冇問過我到底點樣投票啊。大家嘅經驗一樣，一定會一模一樣。所以其實咧，成件事個答案本身全部係不盡不實嘅。第一，佢唔係關。

510
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:42,240
注投票取向，佢係淨係關注支持政府啲人嘅投票取向啫。第一。

511
01:41:42,520 --> 01:42:00,800
第二，佢從來都唔會解釋政策，我唔相信咧。當去到九走到呢個階段嗰時咧，仲有人去講解釋政策嗰方面，解釋政策都揾局長啦，唔方揾個公務員會解釋咩？嚇，所以咧，成件事本身所有啲答案都係不盡不實。

512
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:21,090
浪費公帑，我關注咧就係係咪要噉樣去浪費公帑、浪費我哋啲公務員人才？嚇！如果你話要mark投票嘅話，你當啲議員係咩啊？嚇！佢哋即係要畀你箍住啊！嚇！啲議員如果自己唔想投，就等佢自己唔投嚇，就唔應該由。

513
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:24,200
公務員去搞佢哋，所以我嘅問題就係。

514
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:44,760
局長到底為咗呢件事，你浪費咗幾多公堂，用咗幾多公堂，同埋嗰啲公公務員啊？你話呢度咧就話並無其他額外開支係假嘅，因為佢用咗佢啲時間嚇，噉佢要加班嘅，佢要有嘢自己嘢做嘅。你對嗰啲公務員都唔住，所以我問嘅問題就係。

515
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:56,380
到底你用咗幾多公帑？會唔會係將呢啲公帑慳翻攞嚟做啲正經嘢，而唔係去監去搞呢個議員嘅投票取向嘅？嚇，局長。

516
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:16,670
主席就李員所提嗰個提問，我有兩點澄清啦。首先就係啊，公務員嘅同事或者係當然咧，或其他嘅政治委任嘅官員，佢哋幫助呢一個司局長去推動一啲政府嘅議案或者其他方面嘅工作咧，呢啲係佢哋份內工作嘅一部分，所以呢個唔會話。

517
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:36,680
所以所以唔會話構成所謂嘥資源呢個問題。不過我諗我哋解釋咧就係我哋唔需要額外資源去做嘅。呢啲係用翻我哋基本上現有嘅資源去做呢啲工作。咁呢啲去對於一啲誒公務員嘅同事嚟講咧，其實亦都係訓練一個部分，因為佢哋能夠好一手咁睇得到嗰個議會嘅進行嗰。

518
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:56,690
嗰個辯論嘅情況啊，點樣？咁至於話另外一方面，就話需要去即係落等提醒，即係議員咧去投票啊，或者去噉樣嘅咧個情況咧，呢啲係我哋咁需要做嘅，因為大家知有時我哋嗰個辯論咧個時間相當長嘅，咁有時我哋係需要提升一啲議員係去即係。

519
01:43:56,690 --> 01:44:16,700
啊，去做投票，或者或者同我哋再講翻現時嗰個辯論去到咩嘅情況。咁至於我哋整體嗰個支援嘅工作咧，當然有啲同事係負責，即係啊報告翻畀司局長聽，到底有幾多議員喺喺個議會裏邊啊噉樣。但係亦都有啲同事咧，亦都會同啊，即係啊比較高級啲嘅同事，亦都。

520
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:36,710
都會有少有時會同議員再做最後嘅遊説或者最後嘅解釋嗰個議案嘅情況嘅，呢個唔可以概括一輪話全部都係只係做呢一個所謂啊啊即係點名嗰個情況嘅，有唔同嘅工作去做，呢啲情況亦都唔係淨係而家嘅開始㗎啦。我自己亦都喺差唔多廿幾年前已經開始有呢啲。

521
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:49,490
工作去做㗎啦，啊，咁所以呢一類嘅工作其實係喺議會地方嗰邊咧，係係基本上一個重要嘅工作。但係當然我哋擔保就係話，我哋一定唔會話影響議員嗰個嗰個情況。

522
01:44:50,060 --> 01:45:10,070
借位咗議員，佢冇答到我嗰個，即係到底用咗幾多工時啊？即係我額外開支，其實佢係用咗工時喺度。係你要求係幾多？佢冇答到我。同埋我咧，頭先主席佢講嘅嘢係侮辱咗啲議員。啲議員候票都要睇住嘅。議員我唔能夠容許呢個答問嘅環節咧變咗做一個辯論啊！你。

523
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:14,940
要求局長係提供一啲誒數字。

524
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:19,460
誒，局長是否可以提供？主席誒，我哋冇呢一個噉嘅數字。

525
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:40,360
借位進議，多謝主席。主席，既然我哋廿幾年前都開始咗呢種制度嘅話，我想了解下啦。噉我哋有冇即係參考其他國家咧？佢哋係咪真係有類似呢種噉嘅狗仔隊監控嘅情況出現咧？咁特別咧，我想問一問咧，就究竟我哋而家嘅做法係點樣咧？喺邊一個級別嘅官員決定幾時需要派呢啲狗仔隊？

526
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:54,370
出現去支援咧，噉啊揾啲咩人咧做替死鬼，或者做呢啲噉嘅壯丁咧？又或者係究竟係咩級別，係咪可以降低佢哋唔需要揾啲即係咁高級嘅人士做，唔好嘥用啲資源咧？既然唔能夠完全避免，可唔可以減低個浪費咧？

527
01:45:54,850 --> 01:46:14,860
局長，主席就謝議員所提咧，就有兩點啦。第一點係當然，我哋頭先個主體答案都有講啦。我哋當然一時都會不時都會檢討嗰個嗰個做嗰個程序啊。譬如舉個例嚟講，喺新嘅立法會大樓咧，我諗個做個情況同喺舊嘅立法會大樓已經唔同。咁至於你話人手嗰度咧，我諗有分喺兩邊啦。

528
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:34,880
如果有啲作最最後嘅遊説咧，當然呢個係基本上比較高級啲嘅同事啦，因為對於嗰件事啊比較能夠解釋到畀議員聽。但係如果你話基本上係誒睇下到底監察翻嗰個情況，譬如有幾多議員喺個議會裏邊啊噉樣嗰個情況咧，去向翻呢個司局長彙報咧，基本上我諗都係比較。

529
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:54,890
有誒資資歷上相對比較淺嘅同事，咁呢個其實咧係作於佢哋一個一個經驗一個培訓嘅一個部分嚟講。至於人手方面咧，我諗係交翻畀每一個局，佢嘅議案嗰陣時，佢哋嗰個局長或者個秘書長，佢哋會決定到底需要幾多人。當然我諗我哋都明白呢啲嘅情況。

530
01:46:54,890 --> 01:47:13,100
我咧，我哋如果係唔需要嘅話，唔需要咁多人咧，我哋又唔會做咁多，唔需要噉嘅做嘅。咁亦都唔係每一個議案，通常都係一啲比較重要嘅議案，尤其是議案嗰個辯論嘅時間比較長啊，或者嗰個啊情況比較即係誒誒比較緊要啲嘅時候，我哋先會做呢啲嘅安排。

531
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:22,690
由於冇參考外國經驗咧，由於香港冇政黨政治呢個問題，令到你哋有個困難。誒，對唔住啊，謝議員，我認為你提出新嘅多謝先。

532
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,070
嗯。

533
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:26,290
陳家樂演。

534
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,780
多謝主席，我諗。

535
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:47,860
主席同埋秘書長都應該好清楚，我哋議員咧係知道點樣投票、點樣被提醒投票，係唔需要咧公務員咧去幫我哋去做呢樣嘢嘅。其實呢個並不代表我哋嘅議會係唔成熟，只不過係政府不成熟，係要用狗仔隊跟蹤我哋。主席，我問題好簡單。

536
01:47:48,220 --> 01:48:08,230
我都好多同學咧，都係做緊公務員團隊嘅一份子。佢哋都會話係浪費時間，佢寧願咧用呢啲時間咧係做啲更加重要嘅係服務市民嘅工作。當局長、公務員事務局局長答我哋議員嘅問題嘅時候，就會不時檢討呢方面嘅安排。公務員。

537
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:21,880
事務局局長可否告知本會，會否徵詢曾經參與呢啲跟蹤議員嘅公務員是否接受或者係繼續願意接受呢一種嘅工作咧？多謝主席，局長。

538
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:42,170
主席就陳議員所提問，首先我都解解釋咗啦，即係呢一類嘅工作，亦都係喺即係同事嘅工作嘅份內嘅工作嚟嘅。咁所以當然我哋喺個檢討時候咧，當然我哋亦都會聽翻喺實際上參與呢一方面工作嘅同事個意見。但係我想重新咧，就係呢一方面嘅工作。

539
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:49,730
係喺公務員裏邊咧，係支持呢個司局長喺立法會嘅工作咧，係份內嘅工作嚟嘅。

540
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:52,140
國家奇遇。

541
01:48:53,740 --> 01:49:04,980
主席啊，局長撐得好辛苦啊，將一啲似是而非嘅理由講完又講。不過我唔唔知點解嗰啲保皇黨嘅議員唔出聲，因為監視係佢哋。主席，我問題就係。

542
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:25,340
政府咧不務正業，解釋呢個政策或者做好政策就唔做，去做狗仔隊。我想問咧，就公務員事務局咧喺呢一啲誒派狗仔隊出呢個立法會嘅時候咧，有冇做到監察？有冇唔用呢狗仔隊過去？有冇一啲政府咧係用？

543
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:36,270
用咗，而係事實上係嘥咗。亦都有冇足夠嘅支援，有冇一啲狗仔隊嘅特訓班啊，或者有冇教佢，譬如去其他其他娛樂版嗰度咧，跟下點樣做狗仔隊？多謝主席。

544
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:37,370
局長。

545
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:58,620
就過完嘅提問，首先我唔會用狗仔隊嚟形容呢啲嘅工作啦嚇。基本上，我覺得解釋咗呢個工作咧係支援司局長喺立法會裏邊嘅工作。咁其中一樣嘢當然就係睇下要監睇翻嗰個立法會嘅投票情況啊，去提供一手資料。咁至於話同事用幾多人啊？咁呢個咧因為。

546
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:18,630
頭先我都提過，因為每一次每一個嘅議案啊，或者每一個事務都有唔同嘅情況，呢個一定要交翻畀個別嘅局去做決定。到底佢哋要調配幾多嘅人手？當然，如果佢有啲意見嘅話，當然可以徵詢我哋或者係行政處方面就住呢一方面係去提供意見。但係基本上咧，係由交翻畀。

547
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:38,640
個別嘅局同埋佢哋部門去決定，主席。我問佢一個兩個具體嘅問題冇答，一個就係話究竟佢有冇做一啲諗住做一啲檢討？第二就話對於呢一啲噉嘅被批委監察又好，狗仔隊又好啦，有冇一啲訓練、特訓同埋支援？誒，議員應該知道，你只能夠問一個問題。局長冇補充。

548
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,000
誒，主席，我補補補補充。

549
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:48,680
洪健基議員，係主席。誒，立法會大樓咧係屬於立法會嘅。

550
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:53,910
係應該由我哋立法會全權負責同埋管理。

551
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:14,370
誒，我想問誒，局方響呢啲狗仔隊啊，我叫佢狗仔隊啦，即係嚟睇住我啲議員嘅時候咧，一你有冇嗰個新係咪以一個不騷擾到議員嘅議會工作，以致議會裡面嗰啲大樓裡面嘅工作為標準咧？如果噉，係咪我哋作為立法會？

552
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:22,850
應該畀一個制度你啦，譬如話要申請、要批准、要限定你人數、時間，多謝。督長。

553
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:43,340
誒主席就副言所提咧，我諗喺主體答案，我哋都解釋咗啦。我諗我哋誒，我哋個目標咧就係當然係支援司局長個工作啦。咁但係當然佢哋入樓立法立法會裏邊咧，進入立法會係獲得即係一個誒，我哋有一個申請，亦都有個一個填表咧，我哋係誒。

554
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:57,220
係交翻畀呢一個嘅立法會秘書處。咁頭先我都重申咗啦，我諗佢哋喺裏邊嘅工作一定係唔會影響或者騷擾到議員或者其他誒參加立法會事務嘅人士嘅。

555
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:00,090
我認為。

556
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:15,820
主席，阿局長提到話係要即係協助司局長啦，噉我相信最重要嗰陣時就係投票啦，係要支持，好似李議員頭先講係支持政府嗰啲票啦，所以有陣時我哋都受監察嘅，主席嚇。

557
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,850
阿局長，呢有冇研究過咧？

558
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:21,650
點解啲議員有咁大嘅困難？

559
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:25,670
去留喺呢度，去踴躍支持你哋咧。

560
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:47,010
局長，主席，多謝劉議員嗰個提問。嗰呢樣嘢，我諗誒，當然呢個喺呢個呢個答案應該唔係由我答嘅，呢個應該由即係由議員自己答。但係我諗最主要，我諗大家要明白，有時一啲議會嘅討論長度比較長，咁同時有時同時有啲議員亦都有，大家都係誒好多嘅工作要做。

561
01:52:47,010 --> 01:53:07,020
咁可能佢有時佢係需要我哋提升翻佢，嚇，因為可能佢有其他嘅事務去去忙去做，咁所以呢個其實不嬲嚟講都有噉嘅情況。呢個我哋絕對係尊重議員嗰個情況嘅，噉我哋純粹就係其實我哋同事只係將嗰個情況啊報告翻畀呢一個司局長聽。咁當然呢個要交翻畀。

562
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:27,030
司局長決定咧，係需唔需要同有關嘅議員去聯絡啊？即係叫佢翻嚟投票啊，各方面呢個一定交翻司局長去做。呢啲同事基本上佢只係同呢個司局長係報告翻嗰個喺個議會方面嗰個情況係點樣？兩先議員誒，局長係冇答我條問題嘅，佢話要交翻畀我哋個。

563
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:47,040
當然，議員唔喺度，梗係議員可以解釋。但係你要檢討下點解啲人咁辛苦，唔肯啃，唔肯去支持你啊嘛？你有陣時係咪你哋自己嗰啲建議係好難好難支持得落咯？有冇有冇檢討下咧？唔好嘥納税人啲錢啦！你哋，我認為呢個問題咧已經係離開咗嗰個。

564
01:53:47,040 --> 01:54:07,050
主體質詢啊，吳良星議員。多謝主席。就住誒政府答覆咧，就係講到係協助司局長嘅處理立法會事務，係政府公職人員嘅職責嘅一部分咧。誒，既然有噉嘅職責去做咧，我希望係誒政府方面嘅公職人。

565
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:23,520
員有冇提出一啲要求？睇下我哋立法會本身提供嘅設施，你哋作為公職人員去盡責嘅時候，係咪可以享受到合理嘅福利咧？同埋有啲咩設施係而家係未完善，畀到啲公職人員去盡你哋嘅職責咧？

566
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:44,060
局長，誒吳議員，而家基本上咧，我諗大家都知，我哋喺立法會裏邊咧有一個公職人員嘅辦公室，啊，咁呢個係方便，我諗即係同事有時有啲工作啊，或者聯絡啊噉樣。咁其實喺呢一方面誒，當然如果有咩需要，我哋會繼續同秘書處聯絡。但係現時嚟講咧，係覺得即係對於即係一方。

567
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:53,320
各方面嘅安排，我哋誒，我諗即係誒，即係我得翻嚟個個意見咧，基本上大家都認為係相當滿意嘅嚇。農業中院。

568
01:54:54,910 --> 01:55:14,920
主席，我想同啲同事啊澄清一下咧，就係佢唔係啲狗仔隊咧，唔係淨係針對住嗰啲建制派嘅。我哋咧出我哋出入咧都都係數我哋嘅，因為佢數下咧我夠唔夠票咧，阻住佢啊嘛。咁所以唔係淨係監視嗰邊啊，我哋都被被監視嘅。希望你哋都唔知你有冇身有同感咯，我就有身同感。咁咧就我想。

569
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:15,990
誒，主席啊！

570
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:36,630
阿局長咧不一而再再而三，佢話嗰啲嘅公職人員咧係幫助誒司長或者局長咧推人一啲嘅政策或者一啲立場噉樣樣啦嚇。但係不過咧，我哋見到嗰啲嘅公職人員，甚至乎有A.O.級嘅職公職人員咧，佢係由朝企到晚，一言不發地坐喺度或者企喺。

571
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:56,640
度嘅係冇同任何議員咧有溝通同接觸嘅。佢點樣樣去同嗰啲議員去推行，或者係瞭解佢嗰個投票同埋對政府嘅政策嘅認識咧？你可唔可以講畀我聽？究竟佢透過乜嘢嘅方式去做呢個工作咧？同時期。

572
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:06,500
你話得到個秘書處批准你，我想問清楚：你同秘書申請嘅時候係以乜嘢嘅理由同乜嘢目的嚟作出申請嘅咧？

573
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:27,740
啊，局長、主席，就兩兩議員所提嗰個題目有兩點啦。第一點咧就係誒誒，我頭先都解釋過，因為我哋誒支援司局長有唔同嘅同事啦，當然佢哋負責誒有分工嘅工作嘅，譬如有一啲比較知地比較淺嘅同事，可能佢對於嗰個課題，可能未必能夠足夠可以向議員解釋。

574
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:47,750
咁當然佢哋係幫助司局長咧，係睇翻嗰個現場嘅情況，係作一個第一手嘅資料去去提供翻畀司局長。至於話有啲其他幫助司局長向議員解釋翻個政策，呢啲可能譬如話副局長啊，或者秘書長或者副秘書長嗰啲比較啊高級啲嘅同事咧，係會同即係。

575
01:56:47,750 --> 01:57:05,620
解釋咁呢個以往有時我諗大家都知喺個別嚇，就算或者喺呢個誒休息室啊各方面，如果有機會見到同事見到啊議員咧，都會同大家去解釋。咁呢個我哋有個分工去做嘅。咁主要我諗我哋申請方面咧，我諗我哋亦都係基本上係會誒。

576
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:19,530
係會同秘秘書處咧有一個嘅誒表格咧，我哋填翻，即係個名嗰個同事啦，佢嗰個誒職位啦，係邊個啦？啊，咁最主要我諗喺喺呢一方面，我哋需要提供呢一方面嘅資料。

577
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:34,270
又呢項質詢咧已經用咗差唔多二十三分鐘啦，議員。誒，局長咧其實已經答咗多項議員嘅補充質詢，呢項質詢已經用咗差唔多二十三分鐘，所以如果議員未滿意咧，請你循其他嘅途徑跟進。

578
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:37,190
最後一項口頭質詢，黃定光議員。

579
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,170
多謝主席。

580
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:58,770
政府以原則上批准香港機場管理局（下稱機管局）採用三跑道系統作為香港國際機場（下稱香港機場）嘅發展方案，以應付每年上升嘅客運量同埋貨運量。

581
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:15,420
機管局現就興建第三條跑道進行環境影響嘅評估，下簡稱環評，同埋相關嘅規劃工作。就此，政府可否告知本會？一

582
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:32,250
鑑於香港機場嘅飛機升降量持續上升，並預計會喺二零一五年上升到每小時六十八架次嘅跑道最高升降容量。

583
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:40,860
但第三條跑道嘅興建工程仍動工無期，當局有否？

584
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:47,860
有有乜嘢措施解決航班升降飽和嘅問題？

585
01:58:48,250 --> 01:59:03,200
有否評估呢啲問題會否造成航班嘅延誤同埋影響到航空安全？若果有評估，詳情為何？若果冇，原因為何？

586
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:11,870
二，鑑於第三條跑道嘅環評最快喺本年底或者明年初先至完成。

587
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:32,160
而有關嘅興建工程據悉需時至少要十年，但鄰近地區嘅機場不斷擴建同埋增添國際航線，當局有否評估香港機場嘅航機升降量飽和？

588
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:50,670
會導致香港有幾多經濟損失，同埋對競爭力嘅影響。當局如何努力保持香港作為國際航空樞紐嘅地位同埋優勢？及第三。

589
01:59:51,690 --> 02:00:07,370
鑑於民航處有官員向報章表示，正係同內地、誒同埋澳門嘅民航當局協商，放寬珠三珠江三角洲空域嘅高度限制。

590
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:27,660
並預計屆時區內咧，每日航班嘅流量可以由現時嘅三千班增至五千班。有關季計劃，可否喺二零二零年之或誒二零二零年之前落實？

591
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:39,920
計劃嘅長程為何？有關計劃嘅會對香港機場嘅升降容量造成乜嘢影響？運輸及房屋局局長。

592
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:49,780
主席，香港國際機場係全球最繁忙嘅國際貨運機場，同埋全球位於前列嘅國際客運機場。

593
02:00:50,060 --> 02:01:01,930
喺二零一二年，處理客運量係超過五千六百萬人次，貨運量係超過四百萬公噸，同埋咧飛機起降量咧係三十五萬二千架次。

594
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:07,130
對於維持香港作為國際同埋區域航空樞紐嘅地位。

595
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:17,690
及提升香港嘅經濟競爭力至為關鍵，並且對推動香港嘅全球連係性、經貿同埋旅遊發展，亦都發揮住重大嘅作用。

596
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:37,980
一直以嚟，機場管理局（下稱機管局）同埋民航處都不遺餘力，積極提升香港國際機場嘅設施同埋容量，以應付持續上升嘅航空交通需求。有見及現時機場嘅雙跑道系統喺未來幾年將會達至飽和，同埋面對區域內其他。

597
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:44,500
國際機場嘅激烈競爭，我哋係認同，的確有需要擴建香港國際機場。

598
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:51,000
事實上，我哋嘅一啲競爭對手，例如新加坡，亦都喺度咧，係大力擴建機場嘅。

599
02:01:51,370 --> 02:02:01,700
政府已經喺二零一二年三月原則上係批准機管局嘅建議，採納三跑道方案作為香港國際機場嘅未來發展規劃方向。

600
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:09,120
機管局現在正係積極進行規劃工作，包括法定嘅環境影響評估，即係環評。

601
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:29,410
擴建嘅設計細節同埋財務安排等等，環評嘅程序預計可以喺明年第三季左右係完成。若果環評係順利獲得通過，我哋期望可以盡快係展展開工程，爭取呢個三跑道系統喺二零二三年落成啟用，以應付。

602
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:44,360
最少到二零三零年嘅航空交通需求，屆時每年嘅客運量預計係超過九千七百萬人次，同埋依個貨運量咧係達到八百九十萬公噸嘅。

603
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:49,040
就黃定江議員提問嘅各個部分，我綜合答覆如下。

604
02:02:49,970 --> 02:03:09,980
為咗應付中短期嘅航空需求，提升機場每年可以處理乘客量係到七千萬人次，以及係提升貨運處理量咧係到六百萬公噸嘅能力。機管局正係展開中長範圍第一期嘅發展工程，興建一座客運廊，提供。

605
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:18,780
額外二十個飛機嘅停泊位，有關項目已經喺二零一一年開始，預計喺二零一五年係分階段完成。

606
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:29,170
與此同時，機管局亦都係展開咗機場中場範圍第二期嘅發展嘅方案設計工作，研究係再增建額外嘅停機位。

607
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:48,500
此外，機管局亦都會喺西停機坪係增建二十八個停機位，並且會喺二零一四年年底前分階段完成。當呢啲擴建工程全部完成之後，機場嘅飛機停泊位數目預計係會增加三成多嘅。

608
02:03:48,820 --> 02:04:00,210
喺貨運設施方面，新嘅國泰空運貨站咧，亦都喺二零一三年二月開始分階段係投入運作，並且喺十月咧係全面投入服務。

609
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:19,960
除咗上述嘅發展計劃之外，機管局亦都喺二零一一年展開維期三年嘅設施翻新計劃，進行多項嘅升級工程，涵蓋客運大樓、登機橋、行李處理系統、旅客嘅接運系統以及飛行區嘅地面燈號系統。

610
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:40,990
主席，保障航空安全同埋航班嘅暢順運作係航空交通管理嘅首要工作。而英國嘅國家航空交通服務有限公司，簡稱係NATS，NATS嘅專業顧問誒技術顧問咧，亦都係有維基管局二零三零規劃大。

611
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:57,530
剛咧係評估雙跑道系統嘅實際最高容量嘅。當時佢哋嘅評估咧就係最高係去到每小時六十八架次，亦都係考慮咗呢兩個重要嘅元素，即係上述所講安全啊、航班嘅暢順。

612
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:17,820
民航處嘅航班協調辦公室根據國際民航組織嘅指引，設立咗航班時段分配機制。通過呢個機制咧，民航處係有有效管理跑道嘅容量，令到航班使用量係更加合乎效益，亦都係有將航班嚴控制喺。

613
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:19,410
喺合理嘅水平裏邊。

614
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:33,490
民航署係會繼續同機管局研究喺第三條跑道投入服務之前，點樣去滿足航空公司對跑道時段嘅因設需求，係善用機場嘅設施同埋航班起降嘅空間。

615
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:53,920
香港民航處一直係有同中國民用航空局同埋澳門民航局咧係商討點樣去改善珠江三角洲空域嘅使用。三方嘅工作小組已經達成共識，採用統一規劃、統一標準、統一程序嘅原則，明確規劃咧二零二零年之。

616
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:54,510
以前。

617
02:05:54,790 --> 02:06:14,800
調整優化珠三角地區嘅空域結構喺呢個前提底下，三方工作小組係同意喺中長期逐步優化珠三角地區嘅空域結構同埋管理，逐步係建立包含香港、深圳、澳門同埋珠海機場在內嘅南珠三角。

618
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:27,520
航空交通管理區，令到區內嘅航空交通管理更加係協調得好啲，並且係減低航空交通管理嘅複雜性，增加航機喺區內運作嘅效率。

619
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:37,730
以及咧係逐步統一空管標準同埋程序，從而係提高空域使用同埋空管嘅運行效率。

620
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:47,880
有效有關嘅改善措施，可以處理區內預計航班增加到二零二零時嘅約滿每日五千嘅架次。

621
02:06:48,690 --> 02:07:06,440
上述呢啲措施亦都係充分考慮咗香港國際機場三條跑道嘅運作模式同埋空域嘅需求，即係預計到二零三二年嘅時候咧，每年最高係約莫六十二萬架次呢個起降量嘅運作。代主席，黃連光議員。

622
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:27,690
誒，由於我哋興建第三條機場跑道咧，係引起唔少環保嘅團體反對嘅意見嘅。我想問一問，誒頭先誒局長冇答覆到嗰環評報告係幾時能夠確切完成到初步？

623
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:34,780
有乜結果？張局點樣樣拉近同環保團體嘅分歧呢？

624
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:36,270
局長。

625
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:57,230
誒環評係誒三跑道嗰個公嗰個項目咧，其中一個最重要嘅一個誒範疇。咁誒環保署喺舊年嘅八月份係發出咗環評研究嘅概要嘅，噉啊要求機管局咧就呢個三跑道工程對空氣啊、噪音啊、水質啊、海洋生態同埋健康影響。

626
02:07:57,230 --> 02:08:17,240
響咧係做一評估，我哋估計咧誒整個環評嘅程序，希望喺明年嘅第三季再完成。咁當然咧，我哋係先要將嗰個誒或者機管局應該先要將環評報告咧係交畀依個環保處，環保處會去評核啦，亦都要去環境嘅諮詢委員會。咁亦都有時間咧係畀公。

627
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:24,060
仲去去評論嘅咁整個程序由開始到完成曬咧，有冇通常嚟講係一年嘅？

628
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:25,890
姚思榮儀。

629
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:29,740
多謝主席。

630
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:33,690
而家距離呢個二零二三年仲有十年時間。

631
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:40,170
誒二零一二年咧，處我哋已經處理個遊客誒呢個客運量咧係五千六百萬人次㗎啦。

632
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:47,710
去到二零二三年咧，香港機場個跑道咧，我哋誒之前咧可能會出現呢個飽和現象嘅。

633
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:51,300
係超過當局估計嘅七千萬人次。

634
02:08:51,760 --> 02:09:11,770
你當局會唔會有一個後備嘅方案咧？當如果嗰個客運量超過七千萬人次嘅時候咧，個處理嗰個誒有乜解決嘅辦法去處理嗰個航班嘅升降咧，以免影響香港未來喺區內嘅競爭力。如果有嘅話咧，個長程為何？如果冇嘅話，誒原因？

635
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:13,280
為何咧？局長。

636
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:34,300
首先咧就誒呢個國際嘅誒客運貨運咧，對香港嘅經濟競爭力咧係非常重要，亦都係對旅遊業係好重要嘅。香港個國際機場咧係一個二十四小時嘅誒使用嘅機場，但係喺晚間我哋更加要對噪音係小心，因為要影響到。

637
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:54,310
一啲可能受嗰個航道誒誒覆蓋嘅地區，噉啊喺嗰個誒容量方面，無論客運或者係貨量咧，剛才喺我主席答問都講到咧。誒，我哋係知道誒嗰個增長咧係比預期係為快嘅，亦都會喺未來幾年咧誒，可能一五年誒。

638
02:09:54,310 --> 02:10:14,320
二零一五一六年咧會達至飽和，所以點解機管局咧亦都係誒全面咧係推行一啲誒擴大嗰個容量嘅措施。剛才我提到咧中期誒誒中長範圍嘅擴建計劃等等，希望能夠將個誒飛機泊位咧亦都係增加三分之一誒誒三成幾。

639
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:34,410
噉啊喺嗰個跑道嘅使用方面咧，誒，目前我哋係個誒起國起降嘅架次咧，係誒每小時咧係六十四班。噉我哋希望能夠咧去到二零一五年嘅時候咧，係用盡嗰個限量咧，就去到六十八班。咁依個咧喺。

640
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:40,240
誒國際顧問過去睇我哋依個誒容量咧，認為依個係實際最高嘅容量嚟嘅。

641
02:10:41,260 --> 02:11:01,270
冇多啲問題。主席佢冇多問題，我就問下有冇個後備方案？如果係超出誒當局預算嘅時候，有冇其他後備方案？會唔會出現就係話直情就係限制誒呢個航班誒其他航班增加嘅航班升降嘅可能？誒，張有冇補充？誒，主席誒機管局一直係有台。

642
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:21,280
同誒各方面嘅航空夥伴咧，包括特別航空公司咧，係保持一個緊密嘅溝通嘅，喺點樣去誒，儘量係善用我哋現有國際機場嘅設施同埋嗰個誒航機嘅起降空間。咁當然咧，需求係不斷嘅增加嘅。咁航空公司亦都有將佢哋嘅一啲誒。

643
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:28,150
誒意見啊，佢對嗰個誒未來嘅交通需求嘅評估咧，亦都有同機管分享嘅。誒誒。

644
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:48,440
任何嘅國際機場最終都會受到佢嗰個容量嘅限制。我中剛才喺主題答問都講到咧，我哋鄰近嘅其他嘅主要誒國際機場咧，亦都不斷擴建啊，包括喺新加坡嘅樟宜機場啊，或者其他機場。所以咧，從政府又好或者機管局角度嚟講咧，就誒增建呢個。

645
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:51,000
第三跑道咧，的確係急不容緩嘅。

646
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,420
何君� imperium。

647
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:13,010
多謝主席，非常之高興咧。黃定光議員提出今日嘅質詢，佢嘅跟進嘅質詢裏面咧，亦提到環評嘅報告，我係非常之高興嘅。咁咧，因為有漁民咧，經常向我哋反映，就話顧問公司對於漁業誒，對於呢個環評嘅評估嘅知識同埋行業知識咧，非常之膚淺，有冇喺環境？

648
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:33,020
發展同埋漁業之間取得平衡，例如填完海之後咧，又可能又喺隔離劃個海洋公園，禁止進行捕魚活動，包括一c一o嘅休閒釣魚活動，咁令到漁民咧喺雙重損失呢個捕魚區域。咁所以咧工程完成咗之後咧，又要喺機場附近，可能係機場啦。

649
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:51,100
機場附近咧挖一個唔畀漁船或者其他航船進入嘅範圍，喺呢啲區域咧又冇賠償嘅，冇賠償嘅。而最搞笑咧就係佢嘅環評啊，好多份啦，最後得出嘅結果咧都係對漁業影響輕微。咁呢個我嘅問題就係話，我哋嘅問題就係話。

650
02:12:52,110 --> 02:13:12,120
政府對呢一種結果，呢一種我睇落係不公嘅結果，你有咩睇法？你點樣解決？點解減少咗咁大量嘅捕魚區，你都覺得對漁業影響輕微？多謝主席，局長。誒，主席喺一啲大型嘅工程，誒特別係呢個誒三跑道工程咧，因為牽涉到。

651
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:32,130
到咧係需要填海嘅，係六百幾公頃嘅。咁因此咧就誒一定要好小心去評估咧，究竟對嗰個誒海洋生態或者其他環境方面嘅影響。咁剛才我提到嗰個環評咧，最終嘅報告會喺明年係提交畀環保處。誒到時誒當然喺機管局方面咧，佢去。

652
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:52,140
佢誒準備呢個環評報告咧，佢需要做好多專家嘅論證，確保咧誒社會上包括環保團體所關心問題咧，都能夠妥善去處理。最終嚟講，如果需要係誒填海引起嘅一啲對海洋嘅影響，包括一啲海洋嘅生物啦，誒中華。

653
02:13:52,140 --> 02:14:12,150
白海豚等等噉，當然咧，一直以嚟咧，亦都有一啲誒緩解措施去處理，包括海洋公園啊，其他嘅措施。咁呢啲都係需要誒從呢個專家或者係環保方面嘅一啲誒角度咧，去誒充分去平衡。如果需要誒，如果真係影響到漁民嘅一啲誒捕魚生計嘅，

654
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:28,960
時候咧，亦都喺政策上咧係有一個補償嘅喺呢度。我覺得咧，我哋應該係畀將來咧，環保處又好，或者係環境諮詢委員會咧，詳細去睇誒機管局所提交嘅環評報告。誒，我哋希望咧，依個環評報告係能夠聚得最好嘅一個結果嘅。

655
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:51,790
限制區係冇賠償嘅，咁政府冇答到。啊，局長冇補充。誒，主席嗰個如果真係影響到有啲誒海域咧，係限制漁民嘅捕魚嘅作業咧，喺現時誒漁農自然誒護理處咧，亦都係有同誒漁民界方面係溝通誒，睇下佢哋個實際需要點樣。

656
02:14:51,790 --> 02:14:56,100
過去有啲嘅措施咧，係會有誒一啲嘅補償嘅。

657
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:57,580
冇經驗。

658
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:21,510
所以我係想問咧，阿局長，你哋嘅研究裏邊咧，誒，除咗係講緊環評啊各類之外咧，會唔會都考慮咧？就係究竟第三條跑道咧，係可以提供幾多嘅就業機會，同埋日後會唔會咧係幫助優東湧嘅居民優先就業喺東湧區裏邊咧係？

659
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:24,070
做一個招聘啊，局長。

660
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:26,430
主席，誒。

661
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:46,930
香港國際機場連帶埋機場島咧，其實對經濟啊、就業方面有係好大嘅作用嘅。啊，我可以畀少數字。誒，如果我哋講緊誒二零零八年咧，直接產生嘅職位咧係六萬二千個。如果去到二零三零，假設我哋有三跑道。

662
02:15:46,930 --> 02:16:06,940
嘅系統嘅話咧，我哋講緊直接增誒增加嘅職位咧，誒誒印嚟嘅職位咧係十四萬一千個嘅，咁仲有啲其他嘅連帶職位加上嚟咧係接近誒二十萬個嘅。目前嚟講咧，誒機場島對嗰個職工方面嘅需求係好殷切嘅，亦都誒當然要住喺東。

663
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:26,950
通沖嘅人士咧，更加係誒接近機場島誒嘅設施咧，更加係誒可以回應到誒嗰個誒人力方面嘅需求誒。過去咧，機管局亦都係聯同咧勞工處咧做好多嘅招聘嘅工作誒。我哋亦都提點咗機管局咧，希望能夠聯係機場島裏邊。

664
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:35,690
啊！其他嘅商業夥伴咧，啊，做好一啲誒吸引誒誒各地嘅勞誒嘅人士係樂於去機場度工作。

665
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:37,340
葉志明議員。

666
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:41,570
啊，多謝主席。就啊。

667
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:54,530
阿黃定江議員問阿局長嘅問題咧，就係話喺二零一誒二零二三年即係新跑道落成之前咧，當局有啲咩措施解決航班升降量飽和嘅問題？

668
02:16:54,810 --> 02:17:14,820
咁局長喺個主體嘅答案咧，就都係大部分強調緊咧，就啲硬件嘅設施嘅提升。噉啊，姚思榮議員追問咧，你亦都冇答到啊。嗱，咁頭先啊，局長你講咗啦，我哋個機場廿四小時運作嘅，根據顧問講咧，我哋最每小時可以有六十八架次啊，最高。咁即係話咧，如果

669
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:23,310
廿四小時運作應該一千六百三十二班次每一日，但係目前香港大概超過一千班到嘅啫，即係使用量實際上有六十個六十一個percent。

670
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:43,600
咁頭先啊，局長你又講咗咯喎。而家其實行緊有六十四班次每一小時，咁即係話咧，其但係如果你計六十四咧，廿四小時運作應該行到一千五百三十六班次嘅。咁即係話我哋嘅喺個好明顯，有一日裏邊咧有好多個時間咧係並冇用盡嗰個嘅跑道嘅升降量嘅。噉我想。

671
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:58,290
想問下局長，你有咩方法去吸引嗰啲航空公司係盡量利用而家已經有嘅time slot，嚟令到我哋嗰個嘅升降量可以提升，可以做多啲嘅誒遊客嘅生意咧？多謝主席，局長。

672
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:19,010
誒主席，目前咧民航處同埋機管局咧，亦都係保持嗰個積極溝通咧。點樣盡量係善用誒嗰個跑道可提供嘅空間。咁嗰個航班嘅誒分配機制咧，亦都係希望達到呢個目標嘅。剛才議員所講的確係誒，我哋每日咧唔係話。

673
02:18:19,010 --> 02:18:39,020
每小時都去到嗰個最高誒實際最高嘅容量，即係六十八次誒班次。目前嚟講係六十四班次到嗰個實際容量，但係喺誒晚間嘅時候咧，因為要考慮到呢個噪音嘅問題啦，咁所以咧而家實際上咧喺凌晨誒零時啊到凌晨一時咧。

674
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:59,030
誒嗰個最高升降容量咧，係定為咧係每小時四十二班，咁而喺凌晨一時到朝早七時咧，係定喺每小時三十七班。咁呢個都係兼顧咗嗰個對環境嘅影響。因為任何嘅航空運作咧，我哋就唔係可以淨係睇嗰個單係回應航空公司。

675
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:14,130
啲方面需求，而事實上咧，航空公司佢點樣去考慮喺咩時刻嚟到係誒誒誒誒升降咧？亦都係睇佢業務上嗰個需要啊，同埋佢誒嘅客方面啊，或者係貨運方面嘅需求嘅。

676
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:16,620
梁志祥議員。

677
02:19:17,010 --> 02:19:17,870
主席。

678
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:27,610
第三條跑道呢一個誒方案咧，其實一直都聽到業界咧喺呢方面咧殷殷切嘅要求。

679
02:19:27,890 --> 02:19:34,260
咁但係政府方面咧，就似乎就雷聲大，雨點少，都係檢討多過做嘅。

680
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:54,710
噉我亦都擔心到咧，就好似港珠澳大橋一樣。我唔係擔心環保團體，反而係擔心一啲政治團體，好似公民黨咁咧，就揾啲人出嚟咧司法複核，令到呢一個啊第三條跑道咧係胎死腹中。咁所以我都同阿姚思榮語言一樣咧，我提。

681
02:19:54,710 --> 02:20:10,920
咧就我就問咧誒局方會唔會誒有一個更好嘅優化方案？噉你講嘅優化方案只係增加三分一，有冇更好嘅優化方案去到三分二咧？令到一啲人所謂收入複合都唔會令到我哋香港嘅機場癱瘓咧？

682
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:12,270
局長。

683
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,470
誒主席誒。

684
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:34,760
當然，任何嘅私有複複合咧，都係市民即係享有嘅法律上嘅自由。咁但係咧，都係要有理據嘅。咁從而家誒第誒三跑道工程嘅嗰個規劃嚟講咧，第一，我哋希望個環評係做得最好，係能夠好順利地通過。第二咧，就喺嗰個機場嘅。

685
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:54,770
工程嘅規劃啊、設計方案方面嘅準備，其實而家已經啟動緊㗎。當然，仲有第三樣都好重要嘅咧，就係嗰個財務安排，到時嘅融資係點樣樣。噉我哋會喺適當時候咧，會嚟本會啊相關嘅事務委員會咧，係作出一個詳細啲嘅介紹。誒，整個誒三第三跑道工程咧係複雜。

686
02:20:54,770 --> 02:21:12,850
嘅，佢嘅複雜程度咧，誒接近誒當年即係喺九十年代初，喺而家設立國誒新國際機場整個項目，亦都牽涉大規模嘅填海。咁因此，我哋唔能夠低估任何方面社會上嘅關注。但係我聽剛才幾位提問嘅議員。

687
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:32,580
我感覺到咧喺本會裏邊咧係有相當強烈嘅支持呢個第三跑道嘅方案，所以希望咧誒將來咧喺誒推動呢個項目方面咧誒我哋唔會遇到太大嘅困難。但係反正呢個都係一個大規模項目咧，社會上誒作出各樣嘅一啲提問啊、關注都係可以理解嘅。

688
