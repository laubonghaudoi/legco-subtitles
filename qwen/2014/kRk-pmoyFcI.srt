00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
官員同團體入嚟啊！

2
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,390
就我哋以前第一項咧，就確認通過會議紀要嘅。

3

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,090
我哋而家請緊啲團體同政府入嚟。

7
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,240
咁今日咧就應該有十個團體嘅。

8
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,790
咁而家好似有一個未到。

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,540
有兩個，有一個未到。

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,510
第一同第五未到。

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
嗯。

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,950
咁咧就喺。

13
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,420
誒。

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,150
團體同官員坐緊低嘅時間咧，我就做埋。

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,060
介紹，等我哋可以爭取啲時間。

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:39,140
誒今日出席會議嘅咧，就有食物衞生局副秘書長黃國斌先生、食物衞生局首席助理秘書長林淑儀女士。

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,810
漁農自然護理署助理署長薛漢忠獸醫。

18
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,290
呃。

19
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:55,410
律政司就係誒黎啟鵬先生，漁農自然護理署高級獸醫師就係楊利獸醫。

20
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,510
誒食物環境衞生局助理秘書長就鄭健瑩女士。

21
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,800
嗯。

22
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:18,280
今日除咗出席代表嘅團體咧，就亦都接獲咗有一百五十六份未有出席會議嘅團體嘅嘅信件嘅。

23
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,620
咁咧就個別人士提交嘅意見書。

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,160
咁咧就有關嘅意見書咧，亦都係送交咗畀委員同政府㗎啦。

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,300
咁咧就歡迎誒今日出席嘅誒會議嘅團體同埋誒代表同埋個別人士。

26
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:46,150
咁咧就誒，今日我哋就係會，我會按我嘅次序咧，就誒邀請團體發言。

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:57,610
咁咧就誒每人係三分鐘，噉就等我哋都可以有啲時間咧係預留翻係誒之後，我哋有同事誒我哋議員嘅問嘅問題。

28
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:09,350
咁咧就會議室個計時器咧到三分鐘就會發出聲嘅，咁到時大家都知道係應該係誒時間到㗎啦。

29
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:22,640
咁咧，如果你哋誒唔夠時間，亦都可以將你哋嘅意見書咧誒會後咧係補翻畀秘書處。我哋都會同你去誒畀翻啲誒議員嘅。

30
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:38,180
咁咧，今日如果大家使用個耳筒咧，零號嘅頻道就係現場版本，一號嘅頻道就係廣東話版本，二號頻道咧就英文嘅版本，三號頻道就為普通話嘅版本。

31
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,410
誒同埋喺發言嘅時間咧，使用誒呢個米高峯咧，就係要方便傳譯嘅。

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,220
咁所以即係大家最好就係對住個米高峯，好似我咁講，因為我哋個傳疫源喺裏邊要做傳疫。

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:11,260
咁咧就亦都為咗方便傳譯咧，希望大家發言嘅時間用單一語言。換句話，你係用英文就用英文，用廣東話用廣東話，千祈唔好加翻幾句英文咧，噉就變咗係啊好睏難誒翻譯嗰方面。

34
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:19,900
亦都提議提醒出席人士咧，今日你哋喺會議上嘅發言並不享有立法會權力及特權條例。

35
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,660
第三百八十二章所定嘅保障及豁免。

36
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,190
你哋所提嘅意見書，同樣不在該條例保障及豁免。

37
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,460
及豁免嘅範圍內。

38
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:45,820
咁咧，亦都誒提醒各團體代表同埋個別人士咧，留意喺立法會綜合大樓會議室出席會議或在公共席旁聽會議嘅公眾人士。

39
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,770
須知咧。

40
00:04:48,050 --> 00:05:05,470
誒各項嘅保安措施，該須知以及喺秘書處發給各位嘅函件中，並於各位嘅面前桌上，在旁聽嘅公眾人士亦可向在場立法會保安人員索取有關嘅須知。

41
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,010
咁咧就誒，而家有兩位未到嘅，我請誒。

42
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,460
第二個團體自由黨寵物權益關注組林偉文先生。

43
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,130
啊，多謝主席。

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:41,450
多謝主席。誒獸醫註冊條例由一九九七年開始而嚟啦，獸醫嘅行業持續蓬勃發展，而相關嘅投訴咧亦不斷咁增加嘅。咁獸醫管理局咧，由於現行嘅架構同埋運作模式咧，未能夠有效噉樣應付持續增加嘅工作量。

45
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:48,200
令到唔少嘅個案堆積，每宗個案由管理局收到投訴到到結案。

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:06:05,570
平均需時長達十六個月，漫長嘅處理時間唔單止對被投訴嘅獸醫嘅聲譽有所影響，亦都令到投訴人同埋嗰個獸醫身心俱疲。所以自由黨贊成擴大獸醫管理局，提升局方處理嘅能力。

47
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:16,630
但係，當局應該注意擴大後管理局嘅代表性。我哋認為當局建議新嘅獸醫管理局只係得六名非獸醫成員係唔足夠嘅。

48
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:24,170
有鑑於獸醫服務經常牽涉到其他醫藥，例如牙科等專業嘅知識，我哋應該。

49
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:34,910
認為當局應該將相關業界嘅成員由一名增加到三名，包括係在港嘅執業醫生啦。

50
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,230
藥劑師咧，同埋牙醫各一名。

51
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:49,680
同時，亦都由食物衞生局局長喺動物愛好團體、關注動物權益嘅非牟利機構等代表使用獸醫服務。

52
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,290
這利益嘅業外人士中咧，去委任六名代表。

53
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:05,550
自由黨相信咧，噉樣係可以確保管理局咧有效咁發揮專業嘅判斷，同時亦都可以廣泛吸納其他相關持份者嘅意見。

54
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,460
去保障服務。

55
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,190
使用者嘅合理權益。

56
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:24,540
從而提高管理局嘅認受性同埋公正性。考慮到局方嘅誒規模啦，局方可以因應實際嘅情況底下咧，去考慮將註冊嘅獸醫成員由原本計劃嘅十二名。

57
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,700
照原本計劃嘅十二名咧，或者相應只係增加九名。

58
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:40,370
另外喺貴局產生辦法，當局建議新增嘅獸醫成員會由業內人士推選。

59
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:52,310
雖然喺當局參考海外相關嘅機構當中咧，由委任產生嘅成員嘅比例咧，係往往會高過由於選舉產生嘅成員。

60
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,680
但係考慮到本港嘅政治趨勢啦，委任制咧已經開始萎縮㗎啦。

61
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,800
太過多嘅委任成員咧，難免令到公眾去質疑當局偏袒部分嘅持份者。

62
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:19,540
等到政府承擔咧，係不必要嘅質疑同埋責任嘅。我哋建議新嘅管理局全體註冊獸醫應該去由業界選舉產生。

63
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,080
等到業界嘅獸醫有更多嘅機會同業內嘅事務。

64
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,800
參加管理工作。自由黨建爾東。啊，sorry。下一位係香港獸醫學會陳風玲獸醫。

65
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,580
嗯。

66
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,780
Thank you.

67
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:46,100
The Hong Kong Veterinary Association believes veterinary medicine is being practised at a very high level in Hong Kong, and it is in the profession's best interest to continue this.

68
00:08:46,380 --> 00:09:06,390
我們 acknowledge and fully support the veterinary surgeons' board disciplinary role in maintaining this standard. However, we believe that this disciplinary function should be carried out in a just and fair manner to both the veterinarian and the public. There has been a feeling amongst the profession that members being complained against.

69
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:16,130
是考慮由董事會認為有罪，直到證明無罪。我們也對未解釋的註冊獸醫的延誤表示關切。

70
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:36,240
HKVA supports the bill's proposal to increase the number of board members and the formation of more preliminary investigation committees. There is a need to improve the efficiency in handling the increasing number of complaint cases, which have resulted from the rapid growth of the profession over recent years.

71
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:52,530
It is hoped that these changes will result in faster handling of disciplinary cases, and furthermore, among the additional members, there will be six practising veterinarians chosen by election by the profession, which will increase the transparency and representation of the board.

72
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:01,300
The HKVS supports the proposed composition of two veterinarians and one lay person of the preliminary investigation committees.

73
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:13,570
兩位獸醫，當選擇為他們的專業領域時，會有能力做出合適的判斷，基於他們對獸醫藥學的知識和對當地實踐條件的理解。

74
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:22,300
The lay person will provide the transparency and accountability demanded by the public, and will represent the public's perspective.

75
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:42,590
If the PICs are dominated by layperson, it is feared that such committees would lack adequate professional knowledge, would take a longer time in handling complex cases, and might make incorrect decisions, which adversely affect the standard of veterinary practice in Hong Kong, and most importantly, negatively impacting on the welfare of our animals.

76
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:53,090
我們相信，當前兩比一的Vets與非Vets在PIC和VSB中已經足夠讓一般公眾在管轄區內得到代表。

77
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,470
Overseas jurisdictions have a higher ratio of vets to non-vets.

78
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:05,000
我們相信，這個 profession，一起同軍事復原者協會，應該係working 向最終目標——自我規管。

79
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:25,290
我們 wish to see a licensing system for veterinary establishments. Under the current ordinance, non-vet owners of veterinary clinics are not answerable to the VSB for the practices occurring in their clinics. The HKVA is putting effort into introducing a voluntary clinic accreditation scheme as means to partially address.

80
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,230
呢個係一個大問題。

81
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:38,570
We would like to see the establishment of a charities commissioner, due to concerns that business entities might abuse charity laws against, negatively impacting on the welfare of our animals. Thank you.

82
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,330
誒，下一位係誒。

83
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,250
Dr. Paul Essy，灣仔動物 clinic。

84
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,260
Good morning.

85
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,830
我 commend the Legislative Council on their willingness to receive submissions to improve the manner in which the veterinary profession is managed in Hong Kong.

86
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:10,490
It is my submission that at most one lay person on the board is sufficient to ensure that the interests of animal owners are protected and transparency in decision making occurs.

87
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:28,510
An uninformed lay person would have no idea of what the veterinary profession entails, would be a hindrance in board discussions as the veterinary members would need to spend an inordinate amount of time to explain to the lay person what a reasonable veterinarian would do in each and every circumstance.

88
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,510
lay persons on the board can only take advice given by those of the medical profession.

89
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:50,390
他們 not in a position to judge or even question advice given by those within the profession about our profession. They can only use common sense to see the fairness in such advice or ask for a second opinion. They are not professionals. They are lay people.

90
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:03,570
The proposed legislation, without further changes, still falls woefully short of the required number of veterinarians when compared to the Hong Kong Medical or Dental Council.

91
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,410
this in our opinion is unacceptable.

92
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:17,630
The ratio of medical professionals to lay people on the medical council is six to one. On the dental council, the ratio of professionals to lay people is eleven to one.

93
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:27,400
now you are proposing that that we make this two to one on the veterinary surgeons registrations board. It is woefully short and unacceptable in my opinion.

94
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:36,890
在所有層面，生活，有來到被虐待的慈善條例。這是最明顯的，當我們看所謂的私人醫院在香港。

95
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,680
the same is happening in the veterinary sector.

96
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,850
They are supposedly not-for-profit groups that have none of the entry requirements stipulated by so many well-respected charities abroad.

97
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:55,600
charitable groups in Hong Kong have no means test and no way of of determining whether or not a client is truly indigent.

98
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:07,910
Indeed, it is my opinion that they use their charitable status merely as a tax shield, and the board should be requiring them to open their books to the public and have a means test instituted.

99
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:21,080
until such a time that this happens, they are merely cynically taking advantage of a poorly regulated system, and the end result is an unfair competitive advantage over private veterinarians.

100
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,140
Furthermore, there is profligate abuse of the advert of the advertising rules of the code of conduct.

101
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:34,720
by advertising as a not as a not-for-profit clinic, the insinuation in the mind of the public is one of cheaper services.

102
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:48,160
This practice needs to stop. Welfare groups must be compelled to audit, to be audited, and the source of funding and expenditure of that funding brought out into the open, so as not meant to mislead the public.

103
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:57,840
增加在數量的白人人民在董事會，可被構思為一個陰險嘅嘗試，嚟遮掩這些非營利組織從審查，他們所真正應得。

104
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,060
Thank you.

105
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,570
下一位咧係誒Dr. Jane Grey，香港愛護動物協會。

106
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:28,350
Hi, the SPCA Hong Kong fully supports the proposals to amend the Veterinary Surgeons Registration Ordinance. The profession in Hong Kong has undergone major changes since the formation of the board in 1997. There are currently over 600 practising vets. This, together with advancements in the science and higher expectations of pet owners,

107
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:40,480
has obviously resulted in an increase in complaints. Unfortunately, the structure of the board has not kept up with these developments, and protracted delays in complaint handling has caused dissatisfaction on both sides.

108
00:15:40,760 --> 00:16:00,770
長 waits for complaint closure from two to five years are incredibly stressful for the vets involved. This situation is also not acceptable to complainants who expect the board to act in an expedient and professional manner. It's obvious the number of preliminary investigation and inquiry committees are woefully insufficient to deal with the high demand.

109
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,110
嗯。

110
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:16,660
在 addition， the formation of the board with only appointed members had resulted in a lack of transparency and respect。 Including members directly elected by the profession in a fair and open manner would increase trust and improve the relationship between the board and local vets。

111
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:31,120
比例為 vets to non-vets at two to one，是 Well within the remits of comparative jurisdictions such as Australia two to one and the United Kingdom four to one。在無任何管轄權下，比例為一比一。

112
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:51,600
reviewing boards worldwide, non-vets are present to ensure transparency and that public needs are met. Veterinary issues pertaining to the way the profession is run, such as ethics and acceptable standards of treatment, can only be judged by those with suitable training and knowledge. Vets undergo at least five years of university training and are sworn by oath.

113
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:01,410
Qualifying to uphold their profession and act in the best interests of animal welfare, they are best placed to regulate their profession with oversight from non-veterinary members.

114
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,440
whilst finally, while supporting the proposals in principle, the SPCA would like to make the following recommendations.

115
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:25,090
with regard to the PICs, a further refinement is to ensure one of the two vets present is from clinical practice. The majority of complaints are those involving clinical practice, and as such, it is vital at least one member has an in-depth knowledge in the field in which the complaint is being judged.

116
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:43,880
The chairman should be directly elected by other board members, to consider an increased proportion of elected to appointed vets, as with other professions. In the meantime, a more transparent selection process would increase the general public's and the veterinary profession's confidence in the appointed members of the board.

117
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:54,950
Performance pledges regarding timeframes for complaint handling and vet registration, likewise with regards to vets providing information on complaints, these should also be done in a timely manner.

118
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:07,140
For complaints presented in Chinese, the board should be responsible for translation of the documents to English and vice versa, so the complaint can be reviewed and processed consistently by all concerned.

119
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:26,510
和最後，考慮到一個執業系統，為獸醫診所控制標準，和增加公眾對會和獸醫行業的信心。總結來説，我們頌揚政府努力改善現行立法，並希望進一步的修訂到提出的修正案將會考慮，無論是現在還是未來。謝謝。

120
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,010
下一位咧係誒中國香港獸醫學會會長蕭家和獸醫。

121
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:55,610
咁咧總括而言咧，噉就誒本會就贊同條例草案修訂嘅獸醫註冊條例大部分嘅修訂嘅。噉就誒所贊同嘅要點咧，就第一維持翻獸醫管理局入邊註冊獸醫同非註冊獸醫嘅比例為二比一啦。第二咧就係初步調查委員會由兩名獸醫同一名非獸醫所組成嘅。咁第

122
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:15,620
三咧就係新增加嘅六位獸醫成員，係由受註冊獸醫業界人士所注選出嘅註冊獸醫。咁第四咧，由目前獸醫管理局成員有十個，就增至十九個。十九個人當中咧，六位係由食物及衞生局局長委任嘅註冊獸醫，另外六位咧就係由上邊第三點所提及嘅註冊。

123
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:35,630
註冊獸醫，剩翻嘅六位為非註冊獸醫嘅成員。咁咧誒，我哋而家香港嘅獸醫管理局咧，就其實誒嗰個年資非常之年輕，係九七年後先至成立嘅。咁咧，其實誒喺呢一方面，其實我哋可以參考下，係係喺而家現行獸醫管理局發出嘅獸醫註冊申請文件附表。

124
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:55,640
小一裏邊國家嘅嘅相關嘅獸醫機關，誒，例如英國皇家獸醫學院啦，噉佢哋嘅成員人數係係好多，係四十二個，噉佢係獸醫同非獸醫比例係三十五比七，咁誒，如果係將來會誒誒擴張呢個呢個獸醫管理局嘅人數去到十九人咧，誒，不妨參。

125
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:15,650
考下人數差唔多嘅南非獸醫委員會，噉佢嘅成員人數啱啱好係十九個人，咁獸醫對非獸醫嘅比例咧就十三比六。咁第二個相似咧，加拿大安大省獸醫學院委員會，噉嘅成員人數係十八個人嘅，咁獸醫對非獸醫比例咧就十三比五。噉就其實你參考附表一嘅國。

126
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:35,660
家喺我嗰個誒手寫報告有寫㗎啦，噉啊大部分國家嗰個獸醫同非獸醫嘅比例咧超過咗二比一嘅，噉就誒入邊點解咧？因為獸醫學嚟講咧就相當之專業啦，噉就算係喺我哋所有註冊獸醫嘅範疇當中有誒專長大動物啊、專長小動物啊、有病理㗎咁等等，咁如果要

127
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:55,670
去誒誒，畀出一啲專業意見，或者係對於獸醫有一公正嘅嘅嘅誒誒審理啲案件咧。噉我相信誒誒，嗰個獸醫註冊獸醫嘅專業獸醫嘅成員係應該係個比例上，起碼都係二比一係最最低要求嚟㗎啦。噉啊，跟住落嚟咧就誒。

128
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:15,720
關於非非獸醫委員嗰度咧，噉就誒，其實如果參考翻呢個誒，南非獸醫委員會咧，或者係其他外國嘅委員會咧，就有部分係一個註冊嘅獸醫護士。咁香港而家目前冇立例去管制呢個註冊獸醫護士啦。咁但係香港人而家已經成立咗誒註冊呢個誒香港嘅獸醫。

129
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:35,730
啲護士協會嘅，不妨喺嗰嗰一邊嘅人去揾一啲誒非所謂嘅非獸醫委員，咁仲有一啲動物嘅嘅誒誒誒誒誒保育組織咧，或者係動物保護組織都係好嘅。咁但係咧，目前我哋仲冇未有啲動物保護組織誒誒下任何嘅法律上嘅定義。

130
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,360
咁所以誒，我希望呢度可以做多啲，唔該。

131
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,450
下一位係莊柏堅，守義。

132
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,900
好。

133
00:21:44,180 --> 00:22:01,060
獸醫咧其實係一個非常專門嘅行業嚟嘅。我哋用咗至少五年嘅時間喺獸醫學院學習關於唔同種類嘅動物，由佢哋嘅行為、身體結構到到病症，呢一個大隻係開始。喺開始工作之後，我哋其實係要一直去到學習嘅。

134
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:15,570
我非常同意，現時獸醫管理局嘅架構係需要更改，因為獸醫嘅數目比以前大增，投訴自然亦都會上升，所以有需要增加人手去處理唔同嘅問題，例如投訴、診所管理等等。

135
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,410
但係，我唔同意將管理局內嘅成員比例，獸醫同非獸醫嘅數目變成一比一。

136
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:40,040
原因係獸醫同其他行業好唔同，動物同人係好唔同嘅。例如用藥已經係完全誒可以係唔同嘅，好多事絕對唔可以三言兩語可以解釋得到，亦都唔係其他專業人士，例如人嘅醫生、藥劑師等係能夠明白嘅。

137
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,640
我哋增加人手，係想處理事情可以快一啲，好一啲。

138
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,820
但係，如果管理局入邊非獸醫嘅數目上升嘅話，

139
00:22:50,100 --> 00:23:08,710
好多嘅事將會複雜化，因為可能我哋要花好長嘅時間逐項解釋畀誒一啲非獸醫聽，佢哋但係佢哋都未必去明白。到頭來，好大機會有機會會誒處理啲事嘅時候誒所需要嘅時間會增加，甚至乎係判斷錯誤。

140
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:16,540
而且好多嘢咧，未必係一定能夠誒解釋得到嘅，所以我哋每日翻工嘅時候，其實都係喺度學習緊。

141
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:23,340
誒好多嘢只係我哋行內人咧，誒憑經驗先至可以知道係啱或者係錯嘅。

142
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:44,310
誒，而且好多時我哋好多案例，我哋得到嘅資源都十分之有限，同人嘅醫生唔一樣。例如主人好多時佢哋唔會同意我哋做一啲最基本嘅檢查，例如驗血、照X光、做手術等等。誒，可能係因為價錢嘅問題啦，或者係價值觀嘅問題。佢哋好多時。

143
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:56,500
只係同意能夠試下藥噉樣，但係呢啲時候咧，嗰個病症往往無奈地咧就係需要被拖延，所以好多時醫治嘅效果唔理想，而因此可能係造成一個誒投訴噉樣。

144
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,400
如果非獸醫而處理呢一啲投訴，佢哋點樣能夠判斷獸醫有冇犯錯咧？

145
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,570
真正要喺診所經歷過呢啲嘅事嘅人，先至可以能夠真正明白誒點樣去到處理。

146
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:22,670
我現時亦都有份參與分析呢啲投訴誒嘅嘅案例嘅，我做過嘅案例誒一份嘅資料可能超過一百頁，往往需要好長嘅時間去到逐項分析，而且非常複雜。

147
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:31,680
作為獸醫去到睇去分析對或錯，其實有時都會好睏難。誒，好多時都係靠實際嘅經驗，何況係非獸醫。

148
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:42,480
二是獸醫管理局處理誒投訴嘅時間誒，好多時都超過一年以上啦。獸醫往往被投訴嘅誒之後所承受嘅壓力都會好大。

149
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:59,250
我亦都曾經試過一次被投訴，誒，我可以話畀你知嗰個壓力真係非常之大，所以我支持增加管理局人手，誒誒，增加到十八人加一個主席，但係反對將管理局入邊嗰個受醫同非受醫嘅數目變成一比一。

150
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:07,080
安尼克斯學校獸醫，獸醫 medicine 至於大學香港，Dr. Richard Brown。

151
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:16,240
先生，我們都同意，在過去，Cat 529並未滿足客户、獸醫或相關動物屠夫的需求。

152
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:25,100
The best guardians of animal welfare are vets. They are the men and women with the education, practical training and experience who are best able to safeguard animal welfare.

153
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:37,490
然而，what does one do if one of these guardians of animal welfare is substandard or allows cruelty to occur? This is the age-old problem of who guards the guardians. Solving that problem is the purpose of this piece of legislation.

154
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:54,240
When a situation occurs where doubts have been raised about a vet's ability to perform professionally and so safeguard animal welfare, then the resolution of this situation must have three elements. The solution must be timely, it must be fair and it must be well informed. We believe our written submission covers these three elements.

155
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:14,530
時限ness is important. If the process is slow, then the animal owner is stressed, and while the case is pending, we may also impair the performance of one of the guardians of animal welfare, the vet. Therefore, this period must be made as short as possible. Secondly, it must be fair. That is obvious. That is why there is a PIC and IC. However, what is truly fair may not at first sight appear.

156
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:27,780
The reason for this is that we are not well informed about the true reality. That is why I come to the third point. The solution must be well informed. We are all informed today. There is a plethora of information available on the internet.

157
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:39,010
一 significant fraction of this information is inaccurate and ill-informed. It is tragic if a solution which appears outwardly correct is in fact wrong because it is made by people who are not well-informed.

158
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:48,350
therefore, very briefly, Mr. Chairman, I will run through a précis of most of our recommendations under these three headings: timeliness, fairness, and well-informed.

159
00:26:48,760 --> 00:27:03,110
On timeliness, we recommend more PICs to be formed from board members. That the IC must increase the frequency of its quorum meetings, and this should be linked to a performance pledge. In addition, a review of all previous performance pledges and the creation of new ones for the whole process.

160
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,870
On fairness, the membership of the VSB should be expanded and the ratio of non-vets to vets be lowered to match the medical council.

161
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,710
This will increase the number of PCs and ICs conducted per year and make them more effective.

162
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:27,460
On well-informed, interested veterinary surgeons who meet relevant criteria should be asked to support the work of the VSB by acting in an advisory role as part of the PIC committee process.

163
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:39,600
A veterinary PIC member appointed under section three brackets two should have sufficient professional experience in the subject area of complaint, e.g. small animal practice.

164
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:49,670
PIC和IC deliberations should be enhanced by access to a retained list of specialist clinics or veterinary schools, from whom they can speedily obtain accurate advice.

165
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,150
The board should improve its standard of communication.

166
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:00,650
And fully explain the cogency of its decisions in various ways. Thank you for your time.

167
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,590
下一位係誒，香港獸醫管理局陳善琪獸醫。

168
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:25,910
各位，今次獸醫管理局係主動提出修訂嘅。第一方面，修訂其實係源於執業獸醫人數嘅增加，呢一個係好容易理解，亦都唔需要多講。但係第二方面，獸醫管理局係應覺得應該維持二比一局員嘅比例，即係話兩個獸醫一位。

169
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,670
非獸醫嘅比例呢一度，我覺得需要掌握。首先，大前提。

170
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:42,120
其實有獸醫嘅專業資格，亦都可以有客觀持平嘅態度；有正統嘅獸醫訓練，其實亦都可以有平衡嘅視野。呢個係相輔相成嘅。

171
00:28:42,570 --> 00:29:02,580
雖然只係得一個局，但係其實裏邊有八個委員會，其中兩個包括咗初步調查委員會同埋言訊委員會。呢個最需要嘅係起碼有兩位獸醫，一個非獸醫去評核同埋辯論每一個個案個受嗰個角度，先至可以全面。點解我咁講咧？

172
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,880
譬如一隻糖尿病嘅貓，佢用胰島素嘅分量、種類、監察嘅方法係咪正確？呢個係需要獸醫去睇。

173
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:30,170
一隻畀車撞咗嘅狗，佢骨折用嘅鋼片號碼、鋼釘嘅數目、鋼閃橋嘅方法係咪適當？呢啲係要用獸醫先至可以有完整嘅角度去去批判成個個案。仲未計另外有六個委員會，包括咗持續專業發展，即係獸醫讀書同埋再培訓呢啲課程，譬如超資。

174
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,410
照超聲波、心臟手術係咪適當？要有獸醫先至知道。

175
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:54,930
專業資格認受性係咪任何獸醫攞住張沙紙都可以話自己係專科咧？呢個係需要獸醫去睇嘅，甚至睇落好似好簡單。話一間學校或者某個地區嘅獸醫應唔應該喺香港執業，應唔應該幫香港嘅市民去睇佢哋嘅貓狗，或者保護香港嘅公共衞生？呢啲需要有足夠嘅。

176
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,560
獸醫去批核同埋審議。

177
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:04,540
各位議員、主席，我覺得唔應該架空獸醫管理局嘅專業性。

178
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:16,040
相反，應該借呢個機會，邦局發展可以信任同埋可行嘅架構，從呢一次機會去吸納更加多有能力嘅人才同埋人物。

179
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:36,390
今次獸醫管理局可以藉住呢一次機會，去揾到更加好嘅獸醫，更加好嘅人物，可以參與局內嘅事務，去保護市民同埋動物嘅福祉。希望你哋明白，每一個被刪走獸醫嘅局員，就係減少咗一個可以保護市民同埋動物嘅機會。唔該。

180
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:45,520
誒有兩位未到，我哋唔知佢應該遲下會唔會到。政府你有冇一個整體回應啊？對正華嘅團體？

181
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,180
阿黃生。

182
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:54,720
誒，我哋主要都係聽誒誒，或者陣間我哋誒再聽咗議員嘅提名上，我哋或者再嘗試做一個回應。

183
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,490
啊，何秀蘭議員，啊，唔該，主席，我哋而家五分鐘先啦，好唔好啊？好啊，嚇。

184
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:21,780
誒唔該，主席嚇，多謝大家嘅咁多位誒出席誒，畀意見畀我哋誒。其實咧，就我之前咧，我都有見過誒誒獸醫嘅代表同埋愛護動物嘅代表，噉佢哋都誒同我哋反映係希望獸醫同埋誒誒非獸醫個比例係二比一嘅。

185
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:41,790
嘅嚇，因為誒做嗰個投訴嗰度咧，都需要係好多人手。咁但係咧，我哋上一次咧就問個政府，佢冇答我哋，就係點解佢要保留六個委任？點解唔交曬畀業界？即係十二個都係大家選出嚟。咁但係有一啲獸醫同我傾咧，佢佢哋。

186
00:31:41,790 --> 00:32:01,800
都好得意喎，都贊成保留委任喎。佢話因為成個行業咧就好新啊，好多誒執業嘅就誒唔唔夠七年，係忽然間誒急速膨脹嘅。噉我我當然好奇怪啦，點解大家有得選都放棄呢個權利咧？咁所以我想問一問出席嘅各位受。

187
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,190
留意，即係你哋同唔同意留翻呢個委任，定抑或係希望？

188
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:24,960
十二個獸醫都應該係由界內自己選舉產生，以達到一個真正嘅專業自主，而唔係畀即係政府咁去影響嗰個管理局咧。有好幾位獸醫喺度，你想問邊位啊？我睇唔到有人舉手。

189
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:31,380
我我睇下大家自己答啦，即係如果如果業界自己都冇意見嘅，噉就冇辦法。

190
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,690
Thank you. Okay, Doctor Paul Essy.

191
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:45,890
I think it's perfectly feasible, and I can't see anyone in the profession complaining to have all of the members of the board return from the from the members of the profession in the public.

192
00:32:46,170 --> 00:33:06,180
Indeed, that's actually hard to done in the UK, and that's also hard to conducted in the South African Veterinary Council. Of course, it would be preferable for those members to come from the profession. As to why the profession has given up and they have accepted, possibly six coming from the administration and six being appointed by members of the profession, as possibly.

193
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,490
一問題係經驗。

194
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:17,640
We have known the vet board to be reasonably sclerotic in their dealings with the members of the profession, and this even this even this bill has now been sitting in limbo for eighteen months.

195
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:37,930
數

196
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,570
所以，我 think。

197
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:53,140
In answer to your question, why has the veterinary profession accepted so quickly and so willingly the proposals that have been set forward? I think it is purely because we have had

198
00:33:53,430 --> 00:34:12,850
Lengthy discussions about this, it has this this has already taken a very long time to get here, and just in in in in everybody's dealings with the board in the past, this is probably the most timely fashion to achieve this. However, I agree with you 100%, and I think most members of the profession would agree with you as well, that.

199
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:20,070
We should actually have all of the members returned from the profession and not from the administration. Thank you.

200
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,440
仲有冇其他？誒，Yes，Doctor Jane Grey。

201
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,060
誒唔該，開開佢個麥畀佢。

202
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:52,950
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Sorry, I'm a bit ignorant of these things. I just like to agree with what Paul said. I don't think it's that we've given up at all. I think we all ultimately, and that's what my my comment was, that ultimately there should be more elected members. Ideally, all. I think we just live in a realistic world, and I feel that I feel all of us sitting here want.

203
00:34:52,950 --> 00:35:10,360
Something to happen. We need something to improve soon. The situation has been a long time already, too long with waits and things. It has to improve. So I think it's more about trying to get what we think realistically we can get, as opposed to giving up. I don't think anyone here has given up.

204
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:30,300
但你又 not certainly against having all vets elected. No, I would prefer that for sure. I mean, maybe there should be one or two from government sitting on it to oversee the government side. But in general, the vast majority of the vets on the board should be by direct election from the profession. I think that is the way that we must ultimately go.

205
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,000
啊！陳善其獸醫。

206
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:53,430
係誒，好多謝議員你嘅提出嘅。噉我諗要諗多一層嘅咧，就係一個叫做可信性之外咧，同埋可行性。咁其實香港咧，我哋而家大約係有七百零誒八百位，差唔多近八百位嘅獸醫誒，已經係誒根據獸醫管理局啱啱嗰個號碼誒。

207
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,900
應該係整誒。

208
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:15,190
係開始應該唔係全部執業，大概係四百零位到啦。噉你要明白咧，如果我哋十二個獸醫全部都係哦六百誒，如果全部啲獸醫都係誒由一個誒中文我諗唔到，不過basket即係由一個地方去揾出嚟嘅話咧，其實有可能咧誒。

209
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:35,200
喺做任何嘅誒前審會或者係喺聽審會嘅時候咧，都會遇到一啲困難嘅。噉我唔係話呢一個唔應該係一個原因，唔應該繼續去諗點樣將呢六加六或者係十二個變成全部都係誒選舉出嚟，但係亦都要諗到嗰個可行性就。

210
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,670
係當呢啲個案提出嘅時候，點樣樣係可以更加平衡去睇成件事。

211
00:36:41,950 --> 00:37:01,960
啊，陳家樂議員，主席啊，早晨，亦都歡迎咁多位獸醫嘅朋友同埋關注嘅團體咧，係出席今日嘅公聽會啦。亦都將佢哋嘅意見交畀我哋考慮。啊，主席，我個問題比較具體啲嘅。今日咧，大部分嘅朋友都好關注嗰個比例問題，二比一啦，還是更加高或者更加低嗰個問題。

212
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:22,000
咁當然呢個亦都係我哋誒委員會喺審議呢個條例嘅時候咧，會係會跟進，我哋都會聽到你嘅意見嘅。咁但係除住之外咧，我都想有啲時間咧，就想聚焦一啲問一問在座嘅獸醫朋友，你留意得到咧喺而家呢一個嘅條例草案當中咧，就會見有六位嘅成員咧由選。

213
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:42,010
選舉產生啊，即係由獸醫自己選舉產生。咁但係呢個條文裏邊嘅第十三條咧，就係咁講嘅。成個選舉咧係將會由政府即係話食物同埋衞生局嘅局長咧嚟到負責，包括佢嘅選舉辦法啊，包括佢投票制度，包括乜嘢喺邊度投票，幾時投票啊，同埋係點樣。

214
00:37:42,010 --> 00:38:02,020
為之個投標結果係誒係係確認咧噉樣樣，噉我就想問一問具體啲咧，你覺得呢一個做法係咪喺獸醫嘅誒朋友當中咧係可以接受？同埋你哋喺呢一刻可唔可以畀啲意見我哋？你認為乜嘢嘅選舉方法咧係對於你哋嚟講咧係先至係誒最公道咧？還是你都唔諗啦？根據。

215
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,410
條例畀曬政府咧，幫你哋決定，就算噉樣樣咧。多謝主席。

216
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,990
有邊位獸醫？

217
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,170
想答呢個問題。

218
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,920
yes，Dr.JenKui。

219
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:37,610
I would just like to say that I think every vet who is registered and working in Hong Kong and practising should have a say. It should be the practising vets, so one vote, one vet, which is what we all want in Hong Kong. And then obviously, how it's—I mean, how it's done. I mean, of course, the government have to be responsible for organising the election.

220
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:57,620
election per se, but we just need it to be fair and transparent. There should be a period where people can apply for election and have their own manifesto, which is circulated to all the vets. And obviously, on that day of election, then every vet should have a say. So it should just be, to me, a very simple process. But that's how I would see it. There should be

221
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:07,860
no loading of votes or anything. It should purely be one vote, one vote, and it should be those registered and practising in Hong Kong, because those are the people that are being judged by the board at the time.

222
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,860
仲有冇其他獸醫想啊喺呢度？

223
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,920
畀意見啦，關於正話陳家洛語文嘅問題。

224
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,140
啊，yes，Dr. Poese。

225
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:43,240
In the UK and indeed the South African Veterinary Council, it's quite a simple process. You know, ballot paper goes out at the end of the year. There's there's a specific list of candidates. You you you take your pick and you choose. As Dr. Gray has pointed out, of course, how the actual procedure comes to be will have to be.

226
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,590
Implemented by the government.

227
00:39:44,870 --> 00:40:04,880
但，as far as the implementation of it or how how it comes about, I think that could be relatively means of just one man one vote and a paper ballot. You know, the vet the veterinary board can assist in send in sending those ballots out. You have a registration number. All of us have a practice certificate number, and that practice certificate number could be used to identify the

228
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:24,890
獸醫，和然後誰他們選擇誰他們選擇然後代表代表董事會，我認為如果要問我個人意見，這只是我的意見，如果要問任何一員的專業，他們會選擇有六個代表來自政府，還是六個代表來自他們自己？他們會説，其實不，我們更喜歡。

229
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,520
to represent all of them ourselves. Indeed, the profession itself needs to be self-regulatory.

230
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:43,280
There have been there have been instances in the past that have come to our attention where actually, for example, certain members of the board are not performing their function, or not not performing their function in in in the.

231
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,450
在眼，的成員，的行業，適宜。

232
00:40:46,730 --> 00:41:06,740
我 want to see how the medical board would respond to having an engineer oversee them. I mean, at one stage there was, you know, there there was an engineer that was chairman of the board. I don't think that is the case in in in terms of the medical or dental council. 主席，我我諗，主席，我我多謝先，因為咧，其實我相信要多啲時間，我都再邀請大家。

233
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:26,750
翻去再諗一諗，再可能畀翻啲意見我哋。因為頭先講就係一位獸醫一票，但係呢有六位嘅啊代表咧，將會被選出嘅。咁到底係一位獸醫可以選六個人啦，定係一位獸醫只係選一個人？呢個一一個問題。第二個問題就係好多時我哋都會知道咧，選唔到嘅獸醫會唔會畀政府委任翻入去咧？如果噉樣，大家可唔可以？

234
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:46,760
去接受咧噉樣樣，我都想知多啲。我問呢啲問題嘅原因好簡單，因為我本身係研究政治科學，我對選舉制度咧係有一定嘅認識，咁所以我都想聽多啲意見，就唔係好想咧由政府自己話曬事。請大家即係積極畀多啲意見。我我唔係有意批評或者獸醫唔識政治，其實好多行業都唔識嘅。你講嗰啲問

235
00:41:46,760 --> 00:42:06,770
係啊，太高心噉，但係點到咧？呢個我相信我哋主席，我唔同意你高心問題嘅決議嚟啫。唔係我哋審議條例嘅時間咧，我諗係可以即係我哋同政府去問佢，即係我相信好多人都想了解究竟你委任之前去選舉啊，會唔會選輸嗰啲嚟委佢啊？即係區議會，我哋都傾過好耐個委。

236
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:26,780
委任制度係點樣樣噉，所以亦都有有自由黨嘅嘅愛護動物嘅講話。而家個委任制都根本唔多做啦，噉你係咪仲要委任咧？咁即係大家有唔同嘅諗法咯。非常好，主席多謝你持開放態度。不過有時有句有我排評論畀佢答，好嘛？我排評論畀佢答。你叫佢哋諗噉，佢寫得切入嚟，可能我啲審議員呢條法例嘅。

237
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:46,790
因為我唔覺得呢條法例係需要，即係我唔知道係咪你哋泛民都要攤換埋政府，連呢條例都唔畀佢過啦。我唔係質疑你噉，但係如果唔係咧，呢條條例其實好簡單嘅，有嘅意見先。唔係到佢諗得嚟咧，到佢諗得嚟嘅時間，可能我已經做完呢條條例。哦，噉我尊重業界，已經就即係誒。

238
00:42:46,790 --> 00:43:06,800
誒，你係尊重業界下一位陳志全議員。多謝主席，亦都多謝今日咧關心呢條條例嘅朋友上嚟發表意見啦。誒，大部分嘅朋友出席嘅都係獸醫業界代表啊。佢今日我哋主要討論兩個問題，一個就係業業內人士同非業內人士。咁頭先我都聽到好清楚。

239
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:20,490
大部分絕大部分嘅朋友都係覺得二比一係足夠，亦都多謝你哋提出咗相關嘅理由。其實我哋亦都唔係話即係好似要攻呢條條例想。

240
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:40,810
想增加，一定要增加非業界人士。當然從常識角度諗，我哋會擔心依依相為，即係自己人查自己人，嚇呢個係第一個擔心。噉你哋都講出咗嗰個困難，同埋我哋而家大前提係想個效率提高。如果你哋話啊，注入啲非業界人。

241
00:43:40,810 --> 00:44:00,820
是會拖延咗個效率嘅，噉我明白呢樣嘢。咁翻翻去另一個問題就係選任同埋委任嘅問題啦。啊，如果委任嘅人數減少，亦都可以減低咗大家公眾擔心嗰個政府操控啦啊嗰方面。其實有一題我想問政府嘅就係誒。

242
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:10,890
不過，一人簡字答就係：如果其實獸醫嘅人數係咁少嘅時候，有冇做過一個全民即係全獸醫嘅普查？對於誒。

243
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:31,180
呢個全普選即係全選舉委員嗰個誒，佢哋有冇強烈嘅意見係去表達咧？定係就噉你擺出嚟話六六，大家接受與唔接受，代與唔代咁個問法就唔同㗎咯喎。係如果你全開放噉樣去問大家意見，咁頭先我想跟進翻啊，陳。

244
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:51,190
其獸醫咧，誒，你頭先講講到選舉嗰個問題，好似回應何秀蘭嘅時候，你講話，如果同一個地方揾出嚟嘅時候，係會誒有啲唔好處。你頭先嘅意思，同一個地方係咪話，即係如果全全選舉就叫做同一個地方揾出嚟？

245
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,240
咧噉樣嚇誒，呢個一陣間有時間可以即係討論，同埋。

246
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:17,530
唔知當年政府譬如委任定係選任嘅時候咧，政府好多時就話：如果選未必有啲業界係中意去競爭去選嘅誒。如果選反而有啲人唔想鬥爭嘅，就未必會出嚟㗎啦。即係嗰啲能者，反而你委任佢咧，佢覺得政府睇重佢，佢就會出嚟。咁喺獸醫業界有冇呢個問題咧？先。

247
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:37,540
或者我哋唔熟悉咧，即係話啊。如果真係選選都未必有人肯出嚟爭出嚟選嘅嚇，反而委任德高望重，噉佢哋會肯為社會服務。呢個我都想問下業界有冇朋友即係可以話翻呢個情況畀我哋知。我諗呢個都係問獸醫嘅問題，有冇邊個獸醫可以答答？好簡單一個問題嘅。

248
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:45,370
即係咪即係德高望重嘅獸醫就唔肯出嚟選，就委任長做咧咁？阿陳風玲獸醫。

249
00:45:45,700 --> 00:46:05,710
係誒，首先多謝阿陳議員問呢個問題先。首先，我想回應翻誒兩點嘅第一點就係你話驚一個好似醫商衞噉樣嘅情況喺誒獸醫管理局嗰度出現咁誒，但係我可以即係可以好大膽咁講咧，其實大部分執業嘅誒獸醫咧，其實都即係憑良心做事，佢哋唔會。

250
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:25,720
其實唔係真係為錢，如果為錢唔會做獸醫，因為其實真係揾得唔多。咁咁呢個第一樣啦，即係相比起醫生啊或者其他嘅誒專業醫護行業入邊咧，其實我哋真係揾得唔多。咁所以就誒，即係好多我哋都係真係憑住為動物或者為即係誒嗰個誒動物嘅權益啊，或者或者係即係醫動物噉樣。

251
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:45,730
去做事咁而誒，好似我哋正話誒，我哋獸醫學會嗰個誒submission都有講啦。其實即係要維持一個業界好高質素嘅誒醫術咧，其實呢個係誒對我哋自己本身呢一個業界係一個好大益處。咁所以其實我哋就唔會話擔心咧，係如果你好多獸醫喺個獸。

252
00:46:45,730 --> 00:47:05,740
區管理局嗰度咧，係會有一個即係互相維護嘅情況。咁同埋，如果佢而家現有架構，據我瞭解咧，就係如果誒喺個誒獸醫行誒唔係，所以嗰個VSB入邊，你嗰個誒執業嘅獸醫喺審視一單嘅誒調查入邊，如果係有一個利益嘅衝突嘅時候，其實需要申報。即係譬如啊，原來我識呢個。

253
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:25,750
個誒被被被complain嘅嘅獸醫嘅噉，其實佢哋係唔可以處理呢一個案件咯。咁亦都係呢個原因噉，所以誒，如果你唔係咁多獸醫喺嗰個board嗰度畀佢揀嘅時候咧，咁其實你揀嚟揀去都係嗰幾個，然後誒呢個又唔坐得，嗰個又唔坐得嘅時候，咁個單案就會keep咗喺度。呢個第一點誒，第二點。

254
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:46,010
就係死啦！唔係好記得啲選舉問題係咪？係啦，選舉個問題嗰度咧，咁其實咧誒，因為現有個獸醫界入邊，其實真係人數唔係好多，即係就算你話registered嘅，即係誒都係得七百幾，咁真係做真係每日喺度翻工做嘢，其實真係可能四百至六百人，因為個數字係流動嘅，因為。

255
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:55,550
有啲可能出出入入啊，未必一定全部喺香港。咁誒，選舉會係一個好好嘅方法。咁但係可能誒，因為但係。

256
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:15,840
做緊嘢獸醫其實可能都分好多門派，大部分係小動物嘅獸醫，咁但係亦都有啲可能，譬如係誒馬會嗰度做係做誒馬嘅，或者誒有啲可能喺政府入邊做，或者可能喺大學入邊做一啲研究性嘅工作。咁誒可能喺個選舉嗰方面，我唔知道會唔會都即係in consideration就係有翻即係少少噉樣嘅。

257
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,970
嘅嘅嘅分別，或者誒按佢哋個比例去有翻一個代表性喺度咯。

258
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,240
正話有邊位舉嘅手嘅係阿陳？

259
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:33,230
趁啊，先期受益。多謝議員，我諗我應該係講清楚翻，我頭先講嗰個唔係地方。

260
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:53,520
嗰個裝文植翼咧，應該係嗰個男子嚇，即係嗰個男子咧去揾一個獸醫出嚟咧，就好似頭先陳風玲獸醫咁講。如果我哋只係得大約四百至六百人係獸醫嚟嘅，咁如果揾嚟揾去都係同一班，呢個係一個其中一個擔心。呢個唔係唔可。

261
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:13,530
可行，不過係要好小心去揾適當嘅人選。咁好似你咁講委任，其實亦都幫輕咗呢一個業界去揾到一啲未必肯行出嚟選舉嘅首爾。咁呢一個唔係話我哋想將所有啲嘢交曬畀人哋幫我哋決定，只不過係需要好清醒咁睇。

262
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:18,640
係究竟可行性係有幾多？因為我哋好了解個行業裏邊係一個新嘅行業。

263
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:35,660
你要佢全部一齊選曬出嚟，佢可能到到去即係調查委員會同埋言順會嘅時候，佢哋望住大家，我又睇識你，你又識我，噉我點算咧？我又要去等好耐先揾到第三者出嚟。咁如果可以嘅話，有唔同嘅男子。

264
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:43,130
一啲係委任，一啲係選舉，去開始呢一件事，因為其實我哋好需要去增大嗰個局員㗎啦，呢個係。

265
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:51,660
一個好緊張嘅情況嚟㗎啦，咁所以我覺得首先要清醒一件事就係邊一樣係可行性先。

266
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:03,890
咁跟住之後，下一步先至係到成個局可以成熟，熟到到獸醫嘅業界係成熟之後，先至可以有下一步嘅話，噉我相信到時局亦都可以去睇呢一件事嘅。

267
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,820
唔該。誒，張麗雲議員。

268
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:27,660
唔該，主席。其實咧，一般市民咧都係關注咧，關注就係啊啊驚，即係譬如話係啊嗰個服務啊好唔好咧？獸醫足唔足夠咧？嚇，獸醫嗰個啊醫德同埋醫技醫醫術技術如何咧？噉係嘛？因為假如你啊人獸

269
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:47,670
人手唔夠嘅話咧，咁咧你可能會間接咧就會令到咧就係啊呢個啊啊需求大於供應㗎啦。咁咧就亦都間接咧導致咧就醫療嘅費用咧可能好貴，因為而家亦都有啲市民咧就講話，唉，只狗睇醫生嘅病。

270
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,340
咧睇醫生嘅嗰個醫療費咧，可能仲貴過一個人啊噉樣。

271
00:50:52,620 --> 00:51:12,630
咁所以，因此咧，即係對於誒你哋啱啱有朋友提出嘅建議，話要由選舉產生咧，其實我都有啲保留嘅，因為咧作為一個啊選民嘅代表，即係你哋獸醫嘅代表咧，佢個基本職責咧就肯定咧就要維護翻獸醫嗰個。

272
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:29,450
個啊利益嚇噉，所以肯定好多方面咧，可能佢都要企喺獸醫角度去講嘢同埋做事。呢個係必然嘅，因為呢個亦都係人之常常情，亦都係該位代表嚇，假如被選出嚟嘅代表，佢應有嘅責任。

273
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:50,220
噉就所以誒，即係我我我我我我只係想問咧，即係點樣可以釋除到市民呢個疑慮咧？咁咁另外第二樣嘢，我亦都希望啊，主席，我亦都希望咧，就係啊，在座啲朋友能夠係講一講啦。嗱，通常咧就係啊，假如

274
00:51:50,220 --> 00:52:10,230
話有啲市民投訴啊，或者係即係投訴個獸醫啊，嗰個誒一啲問題，我相信咧多數係兩方面嘅。一方面咧，可能係啊佢嗰個啊專專業技術或者佢個啊程序上出錯。咁呢個我同意啊，啱啱啲朋友講嚇。

275
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:30,240
咁咧，獸醫誒只有自己嚇或者行內業界人士知道啊啊！呢個啊程序錯在哪裏係嘛？外人可能講極都唔明㗎啦。噉，但係另一方面咧，亦都係有服務程序失當嘅嚇。咁所以咧啊，呢一啲嚟講咧，其實誒。

276
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:50,250
誒業外人士咧一樣明白服務程序嚇，咁所以咧就點樣可以適宜到嚇，即係養有寵物嘅市民對於會唔會啊，即係投訴無門咧？因為而家你個投訴機制亦都有個問題㗎，因為你始終係有兩個。

277
00:52:50,330 --> 00:53:07,500
啊！業界代表嚇，仲係管理啊局嘅成員派過嚟嘅，又只係一個誒呢個外外邊嘅代表，而呢個外邊嘅代表咧，隨時可能又係藥劑師或者一啲醫生，咁所以我哋點樣可以適宜呢啲問題咧？咁

278
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,150
啊，陳善琪獸醫。

279
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,440
我會快。

280
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:28,880
陳千奇議員，係蔣議員，我我諗首先你可能要聽清楚我係頭先所有業界講嘅，誒，我頭先嗰兩分半鐘以及係各位誒人士喺度咧都講清楚一樣嘢，有專業資格可以客觀持平。

281
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:38,300
有正統訓練可以平衡視野，呢樣嘢一定要講清楚先。唔係一定即係好多，我哋而家係講緊你信定唔信。

282
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:47,700
呢一樣嘢咧係你要攞隻動物去之前，你已經知道就係所以有個局要去審批呢啲獸醫可唔可以嚟香港執業？

283
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,720
呢個係第一步。

284
00:53:50,030 --> 00:54:10,040
registration執業，噉我哋其實個局裏邊係需要獸醫去睇住係咪邊一個地方嘅攞住個砂紙嘅都可以嚟香港度睇你只貓睇你只狗咧？呢一個就係個局要做嘅嘢，呢樣嘢希望你明白。第二樣嘢就係當有事真係發生嘅時候，而家個局係好清楚嘅，佢係有你有投。

285
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:19,180
就你係可以拎上去佢哋嘅office，同佢哋講你有乜嘢投訴，呢個渠道其實係好清晰，完全係冇任何含糊嘅地方。

286
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:39,490
只要你講話，即係究竟應唔應該有非獸醫議員誒？非非獸醫局員喺入邊呢個而家已經係進行緊㗎啦，係二比一。從來我哋誒一個局都冇睇輕呢件事，從來都係有二比一，有兩個獸醫對一個非獸醫去睇每一件事。咁呢個唔係一件新嘅。

287
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,510
事嚟嘅嚇，咁所以希望長醫院，你明白。

288
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,760
阿主席啊！

289
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:54,840
Yes, I understand the worry about collusion, but I'd like to point out, and this is true, I'd say for the veterinary profession worldwide, we have a standard, a professional standard.

290
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:10,520
And if we believe a member, be a man or woman, is below that standard, we will throw them out, and that is the guarantee, and that is our, that is what's behind this. I understand it. There's some idea that we won't, but actually no, we are proud of our standards, and we don't like people below standard.

291
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,920
Dr. Jane Gray。

292
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:33,210
Hi, I would just like to point out as well that on the PIC there are two vets, well recommended two vets and one lay person. That lay person should always be there. I'm not suggesting that vets self-govern. I think it's really important for lay people to be watchdogs for the public. That's why they're there. And therefore, I think you know that's the view, the way I see the lay.

293
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:53,220
people working together with us, I think that's really important. The other point about concern about all the eggs in one basket that was mentioned previously is is also a suggestion, and I I'm also in agreement with it to have additional people from outside the board who are appointed as assessors that can come.

294
00:55:53,220 --> 00:56:13,230
If there is these conflicts of interest with everybody knowing each other, then you can alleviate that very easily by getting in an assessor who obviously doesn't have a conflict of interest. So I think while we've discussed the the new board system, we've also maybe admitted to talk about the role of assessors and also people helping the PIC.

295
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:33,270
prior to to the complaint being thrown out or not, so I think there are these mechanisms that have been suggested to alleviate those fears. So I think appointed members versus elected, I think there isn't a problem if you did elect say 90% of those members because you would have the backing of assessors and other people to call on.

296
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,280
若必要。

297
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,560
到真係時。

298
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:55,900
First of all, I just want Dr. Gray and Dr. Chan have answered the rest of your questions. In terms of your fees, I've been practising in Hong Kong for 16 years. It has been my experience that all everybody wants to pay less fees. Whether you go to a doctor, whether you go to a dentist, whether you go to your vet, everybody

299
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,360
我哋 always 去 St. Pauley's.

300
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:15,240
Okay, so in terms of looking at what the costs of veterinary fees are in relation to the rest of the world, that's very easy. All you have to do is look at the recommended fees from the South African Veterinary Association, Australian Vet Association, and in the States, and you'll find that Hong Kong actually ranks as one of the cheapest places.

301
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,450
to have your animal treated in the world.

302
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:34,710
所以，當你講起過度收費，我唔相信呢個一分鐘，唔係，唔係，唔係，全部。喺談到供應方面，有冇增加？有冇減少

303
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:52,630
所以喺那點嘅觀點，你完全incorrect，你wrong。所以當佢嚟到費，喺terms of vets in Hong Kong overcharging，我認為你incorrect喺那點。喺terms of there being an excess demand for vets outstripping supply，我認為你亦都incorrect。

304
00:57:53,350 --> 00:58:00,450
my personal opinion and from my experience that I've had in my practice has been that actually the opposite is actually the truth.

305
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:19,750
There's an oversupply of it, and this is actually going to result in fees dropping across the board just by considering the laws of supply and demand. Furthermore, a big problem when it comes to fees is the charities ordinance in Hong Kong, and there's flagrant abuse of this system.

306
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:24,260
是flagrant abuse of the charities ordinance， not only by the medical profession。

307
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:32,800
但 now it's also be becoming a problem in the vetting profession as well. So until there is a regulated charities ordinance in Hong Kong, which there is not.

308
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,800
Is going to continue to be this problem.

309
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,580
啊，Thank you.

310
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:59,600
張慧雲議員，你正話舉手係第二輪定係點啊？第二輪。O K。而家完咗啦，我第一輪嘅時間。而家而家未完，第一輪。而家何秀蘭議員舉手，我都未問我嘅問題，所以你要排第二輪唔緊要。好啊。何秀蘭議員。誒，多謝主席。嚇，我我想問翻阿陳善其獸醫嘅，因為頭先就。

311
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:14,390
住嗰六名仍然由誒政府委任嘅獸醫嗰度咧，誒都想提出進一步嘅問題。誒，我明白嘅。如果喺獸醫嗰啲誒誒成員裏邊咧，有部分係嚟自誒。

312
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,590
誒政府，即係政府部門裏邊嘅人啊，即係例如好似誒。

313
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:39,880
呢個誒醫務委員會噉，裏邊都有誒嚟自醫管局啊，或者係衞生處啊，誒亦都有嚟自各大學嘅成員。咁誒，尤其是佢哋嚟自嚟自醫管局同衞生處，係可以代表到政府佢嗰個誒政策。於是乎，同誒個委員會大家有更加好嘅溝通。但係我想問咧，其實喺～

314
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:59,890
喺獸醫裏邊咧，政府自己有冇一個部門咧？即係漁農處裏邊有啦，嚇。咁誒誒，我理解係裏邊嗰度應該有獸醫啦。但係如果係嚟自漁農處嘅獸醫去代表政府同大家業界溝通，需唔需要六個咁多咧？同埋佢以往委任嘅係咪就係漁農處嘅獸醫定一？

315
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:04,650
話都係嚟自業界嘅，如果係嚟自業界嘅，點解唔可以大家選舉產生咧？

316
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:25,100
誒，正話之前咧，又唔同人，唔同獸醫答過其他嘅同事，你唔喺度嘅，即係你係咪都想揾佢哋再答多你一次咧？嚇，因為誒嗱，主席，我唔知道係咪問翻誒剛才嘅同事咧，係咪問翻嗰六名係咪都係嚟自政府，即係代表佢佢哋冇嚟自政府部門。

317
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:31,940
冇咁細，咁有冇邊位獸醫喺呢度？阿陳善其醫生，你可唔可以答下呢個問題咧？

318
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,660
可以嘅，主席。

319
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:52,050
啊！我諗我清晰啲講一講啦。誒，嗰六位委任嘅，暫時呢個提議喺修例裏邊話六位委任嘅獸醫由政府委任。誒，唔係由政府裏邊做公共衞生嘅獸醫，而家係講緊由政府委任。

320
01:00:52,330 --> 01:01:00,950
可能係有公共衞生嘅獸醫，亦都可能有小動物，亦都可能有做馬誒類醫學嘅獸醫。

321
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:11,150
呢一個係我哋頭先講過嗰個誒比例嚟嘅，咁但係我都要重新講翻，呢一個係一個暫時。

322
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:31,900
提議六比六呢一個提議去推前呢一個修例，因為其實呢個修例已經等咗好耐㗎啦。噉係想呢個修例能夠推行到噉，可能頭先我講好似Doctor Jane Green咁講，如果真係可以可行嘅，能夠將嗰個比例由委任。

323
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,350
嗯。

324
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:53,200
變成選舉可以更加多，而呢一個行業更加成熟嘅時候，咁可能呢件事可以發生到嘅。主席嗰個嗰待住先嗰個心態，我好明白嘅嚇。不過我就係即係我想問嗰個答案，就係嗰六名委任裏邊有點解？即係反問，點解唔係嚟自漁農處嘅有即係一位？

325
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:07,390
兩位，於是乎就真係真係做到剛才啊陳善其秀醫講嗰個誒政府同埋業界一個橋梁嘅溝通啊嘛。呢呢個一陣間我哋問曬政府一次過再或者答啦，好嘛？

326
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:11,840
噉啊，仲有冇問題？有冇其他？

327
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,790
誒獸醫可以想答答啊，何秀蘭議員問個問題，正話。

328
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:33,290
Yes, very, very quickly. I think Dr Michelle Young sits on the board currently, and she is the AFCD representation on the board. And I think there always always is. So there's always one at least. Am I right, Olivia? Yeah. So there is always one.

329
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,640
即係本身係有㗎啦。

330
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:51,300
好嘛，咁第一輪我都想問問兩個問題啦，就正話自由黨，我聽到佢哋嗰個寵物權益咧，就講到話政府委任非獸醫嘅人咧，就喺嗰個牙醫、醫生同埋誒。

331
01:02:51,580 --> 01:03:00,510
係咪斯蒙斯嗰度各揀一個喺嗰六個裏邊？咁當然自由黨又覺得咧，即係呢三個人其實都。

332
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,630
有用嘅，咁點解唔係每一個？

333
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:23,920
都可以委任一個咧喺呢個非獸醫裏邊，咁但係就擔心會唔會六個少一啲咧非委任嗰啲噉，但係當然我諗正話大家都我都想問嘅就係，似乎睇翻啲文件咧就獸醫同非獸醫大家都覺得二比一係舒服嘅，咁而政府。

334
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:43,930
啲文件亦都講到咧，喺外國咧個委任同選出嚟嘅咧，都似乎就係二比一噉嘅。咁所以咧，即係你哋要諗諗，即係同埋正話我都想問埋咧，就啊一間你政府答啦。正話啊，DoctorRichardBrown都講到咧，即係講個服務承諾啊。

335
01:03:43,930 --> 01:04:03,940
講到公唔公道啊，處理啲事幹誒啲投訴可唔可以快啲啊？呢啲噉嘅問題咧，我相信你哋都要去考慮埋而家現有嘅人數，即係以六比誒以十二比六足唔足夠去處理咧？因為我諗我哋上次都有同事問過咧。

336
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:23,950
嗰個服務承諾㗎，咁而家你呢個仍然都係冇，因為你講你有好多困難，有好多獸醫可能又誒識嗰個人啊，正話都有誒獸醫嘅代表啊嘅嚟講，所以可能處理過案咧唔係咁容易，咁又要就時間啊，上訴又唔可以同翻。

337
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:34,320
開頭聽嗰個咁噉，所以我諗嚟喺個人數度咧，我明白雖然得幾百個，不過我其實有個問題好想問阿陳善其醫生嘅，阿手醫嘅。

338
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,880
其實誒。

339
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:50,310
我哋自由黨咧對而家醫務委員會咧去登記嚟香港行醫嘅醫生，佢做個門檻咧，我相信同民主黨咧，我哋都有個好大嘅意見。

340
01:04:50,600 --> 01:05:10,610
而家你正話講咧，係誒獸醫管理局去登記或者去註冊呢啲嘅外嚟嘅獸醫，你就講到話，噉係咪係人有個證書都可以嚟行醫咧？我哋唔係想見到噉，但係亦都唔係咧見到一個誒醫務管理局。

341
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:30,620
或者一個獸醫嘅管理局可以去做到啲門檻，係排除所有嘅人唔嚟得香港去行醫，因為你哋覺得或者你做好高嘅門檻，令到人哋冇得嚟。雖然嗰啲冚冷都係好公認嘅嘅嘅誒誒，外國嘅獸醫都唔。

342
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:50,630
個個問題而家好彩咧，就香港尚未有一個即係我唔知有冇啊。即係香港其實獸醫係咪香港大學都有得讀嘅？香港大學冇冇得讀嘅城市嗰個又未未未啊，又又又做唔到噉，所以變咗我哋香港冇冇內冇本地產生嘅。

343
01:05:50,630 --> 01:06:10,640
噉我就反而好擔心咧。如果香港有本地產生嘅咧，你咧就即係淨係畀本地嘅去行醫，其他外國嗰啲唔嚟，咁咧就搞到我哋嗰啲誒，即係消費者要畀好高嘅費用。不過好彩，正話聽到啊，Doctor Paul S講就話，我唔知係唔係因為我冇寵物㗎，噉就話。

344
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:20,210
即係香港個個獸醫嘅費用係全世界即係算係低㗎啦。咁噉，所以都好多謝你哋繼續喺度行醫。咁但係咧就誒。

345
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:26,300
即係呢個係我會好擔心嘅。阿阿陳壽醫，你可唔可以搭搭？阿陳善其壽醫。

346
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:31,190
為咗避免我由廣東話由英文，我不如直接由英文答啦，哈，主席。

347
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:52,080
點樣話對唔住？我諗我因為好多係有英文嘅夾雜詞語，我直接用英文答啦。好啊，唔緊要。I actually have asked several questions and made several statements, so I will try to tackle the ones that I understand, and I will leave the other ones to my colleague if they have any feedback. The first question is whether we actually have

348
01:06:52,610 --> 01:07:12,620
set up the bar or the benchmark to restrict foreign vets to enter to Hong Kong. That is actually not the case. The unique situation in Hong Kong is that we do not produce our own vets. We actually have to have all vets graduates at a different location than Hong Kong to come back or to come to Hong Kong to work.

349
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:32,630
With that, we actually have schedules. We have schedules that we have vetted out to say that these are the international standards, such as the AVMA, the RCVS, and we use those as the as the benchmark to register vets who are allowed to come into Hong Kong. And there is another sort of additional or supplementary clause.

350
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,810
that allow us to do individual assessment.

351
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:41,900
How did you go about? I think that's a very elaborate process, and I wouldn't intend to go into death. It's going to be too long.

352
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:47,110
所以那係 registration，所以如果那 answers 你 first part of the question。

353
01:07:47,480 --> 01:08:07,490
唔緊要，我係問嘅啫。即係我係有啲擔心啦。我喺我講嘢嘅時間，我都講得好彩，我哋冇本地產生嘅獸醫，好似我哋兩個香港兩個醫大學有自己嘅醫生，就唔畀其他嘅人入嚟行醫，我就唔覺得呢一個或者係整到好高嘅門檻。呢個我有。

354
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:08,520
好大嘅意見。

355
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,950
Dr. Richard Brown， yes。

356
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,810
嗯。

357
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:23,280
我 realise it's quite a contentious issue. This issue of whether vets or students in Hong Kong should be trained to become vets here in Hong Kong.

358
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:28,880
The one point I would like to make is, I believe in education.

359
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,350
and I believe in fairness.

360
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:38,210
And I think that if we had a vet school here in Hong Kong, not producing a lot of vets, but producing.

361
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:43,120
a small number of qualified, a small number of very high quality vets.

362
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:50,080
We might satisfy some of the aspirations of some young Hong Kong students whose parents do not have a lot of money.

363
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,590
and therefore give them an education that they would not be able to get.

364
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,800
所以，我認為一個issues to do with a vet school is to do with education.

365
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,090
and also research link to that.

366
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:03,530
Thank you.

367
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:24,600
我支持CityU on that issue，even though I am not a pet lover。但係呢個唔係討論嘅地方。我唔知點解你會咁講。我唔知點解你會

368
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,610
我冇其他，同時有第二輪。

369
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,910
誒，獎勵雲員。

370
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:49,410
都係五分鐘啦嚇。好啊，啊唔該啊，主席。我另外我都想問下咧，而家咧就誒，即係或者一啲唔知有冇一啲數據咧，就係咧，即係譬如話係有幾多個獸醫？獸醫咧係對動誒對動物嗰個比例咧噉。譬如香港嘅冇乜誒，即係嗰啲誒牛啊、羊嗰啲啊嚇。

371
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:59,320
香港主要都係有好多流浪牛啊！我哋有冇有冇入啊？嗰度好似有三百幾隻，咁咧就會唔會誒有個比例咧？咁嚇。

372
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:12,510
誒呢個我諗係咪政政府有咧？誒誒阿阿陳風玲獸醫你有呢個數字？誒我冇，但係我相信漁護處嗰度應該有嘅。係啊。

373
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:17,310
Dr. Poese，I believe it's 12 to 1400 to one。

374
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:25,230
12到1400 pets to one or animals to one。12，它12到1400。

375
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:45,530
Okay，does that include big animals like horses?Yeah，I，know，we，have，more，vets，in，the，jockey，club，than，quite，a，bit，more，vets，in，the，jockey，club，with，horses，you，know，than，1200，to，one。That's，small，animals，only。Okay，small，animals，1200，or，12，000。1200。1200。

376
01:10:45,530 --> 01:11:05,540
O.K.啊啊，陳善其醫誒獸醫張張議員誒，主席我我冇一個實際嘅號碼，不過我知道嗰陣時我哋誒獸醫學會曾經做過一個誒誒study，做過一個嘅研究噉就係知道香港如果比起日本同埋美國咧，我哋嘅獸醫對動物即係寵物。

377
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:13,080
嘅人數咧，誒個比例咧，我哋係最其中一個最多嘅，即係話我哋好足夠嘅獸醫去對每一個寵物嘅。

378
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:33,460
呢個梗係最好啦，因為所以點解啲費用係即係唔高就咁解啦。阿蔣麗雲議員，誒阿主席啊，咁不如，假如有機會嘅話咧，唔係我我希望或者係政府當局能夠係誒畀一誒。我我都預備問佢，即係一陣間佢如果答唔到，遲下都補翻啲文件嚟睇下香港有幾多度。

379
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:53,470
動物嚇，甚至個獸醫佢啲委任第日，我諗政府如果今日答唔到，第日都即係下次開會都畀啲文件我哋講講。就係譬如你委任嗰啲有同事問到，會唔會喺唔同嘅誒攬度去揾人咧？例如馬會，你會揾過啊？你漁農處又有啊？誒。

380
01:11:53,470 --> 01:12:13,480
小動物嘅有啊，即係乜都揾啲噉。我諗你應該答到就答，你答唔到就遲下畀翻啲數字我哋係。我哋我哋都希望保證有足夠嘅細獸醫咧，就提供服務啦。咁另外，我亦都想係問一問，即係或者係啊業界嘅人士啊，或者有關佢哋嗯呢一個。

381
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:23,580
個啊，獸醫管理局啊，噉佢會唔會有一個可以做一個服務嘅啊守則或者服務嘅指引，喺一段時間內咧，成唔成落到做呢件事咧？

382
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,340
誒阿陳。

383
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,830
善奇獸醫，你你明唔明啊？

384
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:50,700
你要個佢哋服務嘅守則同服務嘅指引啊，係一個服務嘅守則咧，即係譬如話獸醫嗰個服務一個啊規範啊一個守則啊，譬如話我哋最近咪有一個嗯，即係衞生局啊，都有一個誒畀嚇一啲用醫療。

385
01:12:50,700 --> 01:13:10,710
設備嘅一個守則出嚟啊，咁嗰類嗰啲嘢嘅，咁會唔會有咧？政府官員有冇人可以幫幫？誒，有冇人明白啊？獎勵員問嘅問題。我諗誒獎勵員嘅意思係咪話要有一個嘅獸醫嘅實務實業務守則嗰嗰方面啊？即係話規範住獸醫嗰個嘅業務。

386
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:30,720
作係有嘅，而家已經有而家管理局嘅其中一個好重要嘅工作咧，就係誒，即係定咗嗰個嘅誒業務嘅專業嗰個嘅水平。咁有一份嘅業務守則，而違反呢一啲業務守則咧，就其實就係會誒，我哋其中一路講緊嗰啲嘅個案裡面咧，佢係會有。

387
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:50,730
冇呢一個嘅誒紀律言信，就係話佢違反噉。如果佢真係違反，而又被裁決話佢係誒有一個嘅誒紀律嘅問題嘅時候咧，最高嘅嘅懲罰啦，你可以話就係會除牌嘅，吊銷佢嗰個註冊嘅。呢個網上有得睇嘅啦，係咪全部全部？

388
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,210
你你上網可以睇，唔使叫佢拎嚟啦，好嘛？仲有冇其他問題？

389
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:15,650
冇就誒，陳家樂議。多謝主席，就跟進翻我第一輪問嘅關於選舉方法個問題。頭先見到幾位誒在座嘅獸醫朋友都有舉手想回應嘅。咁好具體嚟講，我就想即係重新翻啦，即係我真係好關心，因為呢一部分喺個條文裏邊有寫嘅，將來你哋都要參與個選舉啊，投票啊。

390
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:35,660
好或者係參選也好，誒，我好尊重，都好相信專業自主嘅原則。誒，我就唔係好覺得誒誒，太過擔心，即係選咗出嚟嘅獸醫代表咧，會有所謂醫醫相違嘅問題。即係你如果係噉樣做嘅話咧，咁下次都冇人再覺得呢一位嘅獸醫有咩？

391
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:51,280
公信力可言啦，係咪？咁所以我好具體問嘅就係大家對個選舉嘅辦法喺呢一刻有嗰啲咩嘅意見，想畀到我哋呢一個委員會再同政府去講咧。因為如果唔係嘅話咧，就所有嘢由政府決定曬，未必係好清楚聽到你哋嘅意見嘅。邊位？

392
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,580
畀啲意見我哋啊，唔該。啊，Yes, Doctor Gray。

393
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:14,950
Hi, yeah, thank you. I'm I'm glad you've given me chance to reply. Yeah, I'm obviously originally from England. I've been here twenty-three years, so I consider myself a Hong Kongian now. Even though my Cantonese is very bad, but basically, I'm also a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in New K, because that's where I qualified. And every year they hold election.

394
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:34,960
for elected members, what happens is there is we have one vet one vote, but if there are six members up for election, then we have six votes and we have to mark six places on the election ballot. And as was alluded by one of my colleagues, each each time we get sent out information on each vet, they have to.

395
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:54,970
prepare a manifesto to explain why they want to sit on the board, what they can bring, what they hope to achieve, just like in any governmental style position. And obviously, then I I always read it and I I basically make my decision. The good thing is you can do it both by paper ballot and now, hopefully, Hong Kong is a very technological place. You can also should.

396
01:15:54,970 --> 01:16:14,980
be able to do it by by computer as well. Electronic way. Yeah, I have I have a password that's exclusive to me. I can go onto the pass onto the computer and then I can make my vote. I think there's no reason why the Hong Kong can and maybe shouldn't adopt the UK. But I'm just suggesting that's my personal experience and I don't see why there's any reason.

397
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:18,520
They couldn't adopt that procedure. Thank you.

398
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,800
有啲 opinions regarding the methods of election.

399
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:34,890
Yes, Dr. Brown. I mean, I would support Jane. I think that sounds reasonable. It sounds fair, and if it's done efficiently in the modern age, it should be should be okay.

400
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,150
仲仲有冇？

401
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:42,310
要跟進，陳議員，你等佢哋答你。係啊。

402
01:16:42,990 --> 01:17:03,000
佢哋冇人想答你咯喎。啊，Doctor誒S，Thank you。There can also be a paper ballot， you know， with the ballot being posted out to the practices as long as the practicing number corresponds to the veterinarian。I mean， there can be multiple means of of of offering the ballot within a certain time period， so there can be you know even as Doctor Jane is is

403
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:23,010
is suggesting there can be a technological method, there can also be one you know just a normal written in ballot. As long as it just as long as the veterinary is correctly represented, and there's and there's a certain time frame. For example, they could do it in the first two weeks of September, from the first to the fourteen th of September, written in ballots as well as as as

404
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:33,220
as well as a ballots using technology, in a shorter time frame as possible, so that it's fair and transparent, and something like that really should be very easy to administer.

405
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:54,360
OK，thank you。唔該曬。我諗，主席呢個問題，我哋而家開會再同政府去傾一傾，睇佢哋點樣同啊。我諗變咗，我哋審議時間可以講，甚至去到佢未必有個實質，佢可以喺二讀三讀嘅時間，如果越趌起身講，佢想點咁都可以嘅。如果佢哦咁睇翻個條例草案點樣寫啦？睇下呢方面點樣樣係可以進一步落實。

406
01:17:54,390 --> 01:18:01,750
嗰個選舉嘅辦法咧，多謝主席。已經就問就問曬啦。誒，政府你哋有冇一個整體嘅回答啊，黃生？

407
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:13,550
誒主席或者我嘗試下，即係誒有幾個，即係剛才誒，無論業界或者係誒議員都，即係討論得比較多嘅問題咧，我簡短咁做一個回應啦。

408
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:33,840
首先嗰個誒啱最最啱提個問題個選舉方法嗰度咧，噉我想講一講咧，就係而家誒喺大家面前嗰個誒法例咧，就主要係授權誒局長去做呢一個誒誒誒選舉法例噉，但個選舉嘅方法噉，但係咧嗰個誒。

409
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:53,850
其實個手續咧，就係我哋都會透過一個即係附屬法例形式咧，再徵詢嘅立法會個意見，然後然後先至落實嘅。咁即係會簡單嚟講咧，就立法會仲有會有機會誒，係就住嗰個誒選舉方法咧，係提出佢嘅睇法，亦都亦都喺個過程裏邊，亦都可以再聽即係業界嘅意見啦。咁呢個會係一個，亦都會係一個即係誒。

410
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:58,180
下一個步驟同埋一個即係即係公開透明嘅一個一一個一個過程嚟嘅。

411
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:18,710
誒第二樣咧就講咗誒誒，亦都其實無論係上一次嘅會或者今次啲會咧，都有講過好多就關於嗰個誒比例啦，二比一個比例嘅問題啦。噉我呢度我我我唔再重複啦，政府嘅立場。噉我哋誒誒以前都講過，就係我哋係睇咗今天嗰個嗰個情況，我哋覺得誒呢個噉嘅嗰個。

412
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:38,720
比例係適合嘅。咁剛才都有議員咧，係再再細心咁再問咧，就係當我哋講話二比一個比例嘅時候咧，其實二嗰度當中咧，其實係有誒有六個咧係誒選任嘅，有六有六個咧就係誒誒誒係將來係會即係透過呢個選區產生嘅。噉就住呢一個噉嘅即係誒。

413
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:58,730
做法咧，誒，其實我想提出咧，就係誒，我哋喺兩年前做嗰個誒誒公眾諮詢，亦都牽牽涉誒，亦亦有有有呢個誒徵詢呢個業界意見嘅時候咧，呢一個呢個比例其實已經係即係講過誒誒出咗嚟嘅。噉我我我我哋好相信咧，就係即係無論業界或者其他啲即係潛民者都係。

414
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,060
係。

415
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:19,350
誒，好似我哋咁咧，就睇咗香港而家實際嘅情況，譬如話嗰個個業個個業界個發展有幾成熟啊，等等咁嚟就落即係落一個大體嘅判斷，就覺得呢個呢一個噉嘅誒比例咧，亦都適合香港今天嗰個情況。咁長遠嚟講，會唔會好似即係話有啲業界或者有議員講？

416
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:39,360
講話啊！我哋會再會要多一啲嘅嗰個即係選舉嘅成員咧。咁呢個呢個可以係一個即係長遠長遠嘅嘅一個一個到時再考慮啦。咁但係今天即係我想再即係提一次咧，都呢個亦都係喺而家個個畀畀大家發嚟一個一個一個好具體嘅建議咧，就係我哋講而家嗰個擺大嘅。

417
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:59,370
面前嗰個咧，我哋覺得大體應該係即係適合香港而家個個情況。考慮到好似我之前講誒誒個業界整體嘅發展嘅情況啊，我哋嗰啲即係誒誒，我哋睇得到，譬如話以往呢一個誒誒細個兩個會會咧，其實佢佢係大。

418
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:19,380
大體個運作咧，其實係嗯公正嘅。咁但係，只不過咧就係因為喺嗰個，因為因為人手問題咧，喺誒嗰個投訴多咗咧，係係喺處理個投訴咯，確切咧係可以即係可以喺個效率度可以再做好啲。咁正正係就就算呢點咧，我哋係而家亦都建議咧係誒增加人手啦。

419
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:30,150
無論係嗰個誒委員會自己本身，我哋誒誒誒部門嘅人手，亦都會按住嗰個需要咧，係去增加，去希望可以處理處理好呢個問題嘅。

420
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:40,370
咁另外誒，正話都有一啲委員誒，亦亦都有誒業界誒嘅嘅嘅朋友講過提提出一點咧，就係而家喺嗰個。

421
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,400
市面上咧係有可能個別嘅。

422
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:59,230
一啲係誒水診所，係用一個即係誒非牟利或者係即係唔賺錢嗰個嗰個嗰個誒一個噉嘅一個一個一個一個一個性稱去去去運作啦噉樣，咁誒嗰個就其實係一個。

423
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:19,750
遠遠闊過呢個獸醫行業呢個問題啦，因為嗰個係牽涉到即係究竟啲誒有有人投資喺呢啲呢啲呢啲呢啲誒誒呢啲診所嘅時候，佢誒究竟係賺錢唔賺錢啦？呢啲係亦都有有啲人用一個所謂即係誒誒誒時時段睇嗰個個個個名義去做，咁呢個係一個好好闊嘅問題，唔係單係即係即係獸醫行業咯。我我自

424
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:39,760
喺度即係想講咧，就係誒喺呢啲情況之下咧，其實個診所本身裏邊嘅獸醫佢哋嘅操守一定係受嗰個即係誒即係同呢個誒獸醫有誒誒專業有關嗰個嗰個誒誒，正如我講過啦，嗰啲code of practice需要去管嘅。噉就誒喺呢方面，我我哋覺得而家個制度興。

425
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:59,770
應該係應該係即係誒冇問題嘅。咁至於話誒有有一啲投資人士用一個誒慈善、慈善嗰個個個個個理念去去做呢樣嘢，或者或者其實唔係，其實佢誒即係話就話係慈善，其實就唔係唔係慈善。咁呢個呢個呢個問題咧係唔係即係唔係我。

426
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,790
呢個法例可以可以處理到嘅啦，恐怕。

427
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:03,510
咁誒？

428
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:24,200
誒，剛才都有問到一啲即係資料嘅問題啦。誒，提出就譬如話誒，我哋譬如話誒，同呢個譬如日本、美國點樣點樣點樣點樣誒誒比較，即係譬如話個誒收醫嘅人數相對於嗰個誒人口或者嗰個即係即係動動物嘅比例等等。咁誒，剛才提嗰啲數字。

429
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:44,210
應該係準確嘅，我哋嘅掌握都係咧，就係個數字大概都係應該係一比一千二百咁上下，我記得嚇。如果冇記錯，呢個我可以稍後補充嘅。咁亦都誒呢個比例咧就係誒剛才説係啱嘅，就係如果我哋比比較日本啊或者美國等等等咧，其實我哋即係受依個個人。

430
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:49,740
個人人人人數咧係唔少嘅嚇，即係我我哋覺得應該係誒足夠嘅。

431
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:52,290
噉就誒。

432
01:23:52,840 --> 01:24:08,280
亦都上一次嘅誒會議都有講，亦都今次都有再重複啦，就係啊誒，我哋可唔可以喺嗰個將來呢一個誒管理委員會喺處理呢啲誒投訴個案嘅時候咧，有一個performance plan，即係話可唔可以有一個誒，即係誒？

433
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:28,670
誒一個承諾咧，就住嗰啲譬如服務時間等等。咁誒，我我想再重申一次咧，就係喺而家嗰個處理嗰個誒投訴嗰個環節裏面咧，其實有有幾個唔同嘅環節咧。第一個就係個即係排期嘅環節咧，跟住咧就係嗰個個審理嗰部分咧。噉我上次都有解釋過，我再再重申咧，就係我哋好相信咧，就係人手多。

434
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:34,820
咗之後咧，喺嗰個排期嗰度咧，我哋確切係可以會可以。

435
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:55,160
誒會快好多嘅，嚇會會會快嘅。咁只係快到幾多咧？我我我哋其實就想咧，係就喺個新嘅制度實踐咗之後咧，我哋開始睇清楚問題嘅時候咧，然後先去諗係咪要有一個即係所謂服務承諾咧。喺呢個位度咧，我哋我哋唔排除，我哋可以即係就算唔係今天咧，喺喺嗰個喺個制度運作一段時。

436
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:15,170
眼之後咧，或者係可以畀到個風聲落，但係就住嗰個案件每一個個別案件本身，佢調要查幾耐呢？呢一個環節咧，就我我哋就都係維持我哋嘅嘅睇法咧，就我我哋覺得就唔適宜喺呢一個位度咧有一個所謂即係風聲啦，因為咧每一個案佢佢自己本身咧可以有佢自己獨特性。咁如果睇。

437
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:34,310
睇翻我哋過去誒呢呢十年八年嘅運作咧，其實實情咧近年嗰啲誒個案咧，嗰個複雜性咧係越嚟越即係誒越嚟越複雜嘅。因為可能因為我哋即係我哋嘅獸醫行業入入咗好多啲即係好專業嘅一啲一一一啲一啲一啲誒誒即係誒治病方法啦。咁所以喺呢一個位度，即係

438
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:48,890
每一個自己本身調查呢個呢個環節，要要幾多時間咧？我哋嘅確切就喺呢個階段，我哋覺得係即係誒，未未必係即係未必係誒係係係適當咧，係做一個作為即係服務承諾。

439
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,280
就誒。

440
01:25:51,730 --> 01:26:11,740
或者我講到呢度啦，或者我我可能都遺漏咗，因為實誒實實情，剛才提嘅問題都相當多。噉我誒喺度等停一停咧，咁睇下議員有冇其他嘅嘅問題，或者我稍後可以再嘗試補充。多謝。而家我哋審議嘅時間，我哋都可以翻轉頭傾，有冇同事想有政話你問嘅問題，政府冇答，你想而家問啊？

441
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,840
問佢，叫佢答。

442
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,270
冇啊嘛。

443
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:34,650
阿何秀蘭議員，誒，我都我都係問翻嗰個問題就係主席，就係即係佢嗰佢嗰六名委任咧，裏邊點解即係唔係唔係漁農處裏邊有獸醫喺度，而係喺業內度揀？咁既然如果係即係業內自己監管，你又揾翻業內嘅人，咁點解唔放埋出嚟畀業界裏邊選舉產生咧？

444
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:54,660
噉我睇翻個文件，佢冇答過嘅喎。佢而家仲有個新嘅名號咧，主席，佢又唔講委任，佢叫選任與非選任啊。誒唔緊要啦，就誒黃生，你答唔答到呢個問題？誒而家現目即係嗱，喂，我只係講話今天啦。誒而喺現目其實嗰六位席位裏邊咧，其實係有。

445
01:26:54,660 --> 01:27:14,670
個位係誒我哋護理處嘅同事嘅，咁個理據咧，其實因為誒可能即係話即係即係啲誒誒業內人士喺度提出咧，就係喺整個獸醫服務行業裏邊咧，冇錯誒負責呢一個誒我哋叫做啲小動物嗰個即係護理嘅，佢個佔嘅比例係多嘅，但係咧我我哋都唔好。

446
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:34,680
忘記咧，就係其實嗰個行業好好闊嘅，亦都有一個譬如一個範疇咧，就係即係公共衞生、公共誒公誒public health呢個呢個範疇。咁所以我哋喺選任嘅時候咧，都有兼顧到咧點咧。噉就誒，即係除咗係馬馬嗰方面有有代表咧，可能誒我我哋而家喺個誒公共衞生嗰邊咧，亦都有一個即係漁護處嘅代表咧，就係即係。

447
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:54,690
兼顧翻呢一方面咁噉，我相信將來我哋做嗰個委任啊，誒都會係即係用翻即係同樣嘅原則去睇睇嗰個問題啊。多謝主席，仲有大學啲教授咯，咁所以係冇錯，係啊，都係都係主席其實咧，我同意係應該嚟自各個崗位嘅。即係如果政府要委任，即係一到兩個係漁護處咧。

448
01:27:54,690 --> 01:28:14,700
呢個即係我都明白可以接受，但係既然你講得出話啊，係分誒唔同嘅動物種類，咁其實你可以講埋出嚟嘅就請業界自己喺即係唔同動物種類嘅獸醫嗰度，大家自己互選咯，唔使你同佢揀。唔係啊，何秀蘭姨，我我明白你係即係想叫佢一係就誒噉樣委任，一係。

449
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:22,740
係就選曬出嚟噉，呢個有唔同嘅同事有唔同嘅意見噉，但係其實正話業界你唔喺度咧，佢哋都好。

450
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:43,030
即係好點樣講啊？待住先啫嘛，大家但係最終都想選曬。佢接受有一半委任嘅，咁即係個個理由係有唔同㗎啦。咁但係佢哋嗱，主席，我我嘅意見咧就係即係現實係由人創造嘅。唔係我我明，我我冇意見。但但係咧，我想政府自己補翻一點咧，就係因為佢嗰個文件。

451
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:51,690
咧係完全迴避咗呢個問題，起碼佢要白紙黑字自己講得翻出嚟，因為我哋上個會有問佢㗎嘛，但係咧你睇佢文件咧。

452
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:59,890
第四段、第五段、第六段咧，佢係迴避曬呢個問題。唔緊要啊！我哋繼你繼續問啦，即係我哋有嘅時有的是時間。

453
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,660
O.K.，蔣麗雲議員。

454
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:22,020
唔該，主席。嗱，啱啱咧就誒政府方面就回應咗啦，嚇動物從獸醫嘅比例大概係一比千二啊，即係其他嘅地方啦，係咪？噉我想知道而家香港係一比幾咧？因為你喺文件裏話你估計咧就將會有足夠嘅獸醫。唔係，我諗我諗佢講係一比千二係香港嘅比例。

455
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:30,180
比例外國有好多比例係其實仲多嘅，講講話日本啊咁都係類似啊嘛。誒你誒薛守義。

456
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:51,650
補充一下，頭先啊，王秘書長講個比例咧，一比千二咧係講香港係一個獸醫比一千二百隻嘅小動物嘅比例。咁至於日本咧，大概係一比二千，係啦，一比二千。而美國咧就係一比三千三到，一比三。

457
01:29:51,650 --> 01:30:00,300
三千三呢個係二零一二年嘅數字，噉啊兩年之後會唔會有轉變咧？噉我係會翻去做啲研究，再話畀你聽。

458
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:02,890
將來運營仲有冇跟進？

459
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:16,050
誒，暫時係咁先。O K，嗱，我哋要問嘅問題咧，就誒關於團體出席嘅咧，已經差唔多去到呢個環節，我哋做完㗎啦。

460
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:35,120
咁咧就誒，我哋會繼續同政府去討論嗰一個條例嘅政策。咁咧就多謝今日出席嘅團體。咁咧就誒，咁即係亦都多謝你哋提出嘅意見啦。噉我哋就會同政府，你哋可以誒先行離席。Yes，Doctor S。

461
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:41,950
我 just like to ask one or two questions, please, before we before we adjourn. I'm sorry.

462
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,080
yes.

463
01:30:43,360 --> 01:31:03,370
所以我 just我 just like to ask Mr Wong one or two questions before before we change the topic. Can you put it in writing? Because on this deputation, this is we we can't keep allowing dialogues between the people coming in or and talking to the. I understand that, but we have but we haven't been given any opportunity. I just

464
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:09,160
call， I just call that part. If you need to ask them a question, please write them. Okay.

465
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:16,660
因為，otherwise， if I allow you to ask questions， and officials to answer the question， then the others

466
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:25,770
people could also be doing the same thing， and then we we would be， this would be out of control。 okay。 okay， understand。 thank you for coming。

467
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:47,020
咁咧，政府當局已經喺十月廿八嘅會議上咧提出嘅事項，有作出回應。有關跟進嘅事項及當局嘅回應咧，就已經喺立法會C B括弧三一三三縮十四D十五括弧零一同埋C B括弧三一三三縮十四。

468
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:55,150
第十五括弧零二嘅文件，噉就阿黃生，你會唔會簡單啲解釋下，定係阿？

469
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,640
林女士，你解釋啊！

470
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:19,070
係誒，多謝主席。誒噉，我哋個文件上面咧，其實就回應咗上一次誒喺個會議上面誒議員所提出嘅一啲嘅誒問題咯。咁誒，剛才阿何議員都有提到嘅，我哋喺文件裡面咧，就首先就有即係再重新講翻誒誒獸醫。

471
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:39,080
管理局咧，佢嗰個嘅工作噉，我諗喺誒剛剛誒同業界一齊嗰個討論裡面咧，都已經討論咗好多咁誒，即係特別有一點我哋想即係誒強調嘅就係獸醫管理局除咗即係處理一啲嘅個案之外咧，其實佢哋最最緊要嘅都係喺嗰個嘅誒獸醫專業嗰個嘅。

472
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:59,090
監管裏面噉，所以我哋睇到嘅就係誒嗰個成員比例嗰方面咧，佢哋係有即係需要有誒唔同即係同埋嗰個嘅專業嗰個背景啦。我哋睇到係即係相當重要嘅。咁有一點我哋特別想重申嘅就係話誒，獸醫管理局係一九九七年成立嘅。雖然佢哋誒而家十位。

473
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:19,100
啲嘅委員咧都係由政府委任，咁但係其實佢哋嗰個運作一直以嚟咧都係獨立運作，就即係誒冇受到政府嗰個嘅誒誒即係誒影響嘅。噉我哋誒睇到就係過去佢哋嗰個獸醫同非獸醫嗰個比例咧係大概二比一，噉我哋相信咧即係。

474
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:39,110
呢一個比例對誒平衡整體嗰個公眾利益咧係誒合適嘅。咁所以當我哋喺兩年前去做嗰個嘅公共諮即係公眾諮詢去做呢個修改嘅時候咧，其實我哋都係建議翻呢一個二比一嘅比例。咁誒喺當時嘅公眾諮詢嘅時候咧，都係大部分誒有我哋收到七百幾。

475
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:59,120
幾份嘅誒回應啦，咁大部分都係支持。咁剛才誒業界嘅代表其實都對呢一方面有一個即係都係支持嘅。咁至於阿何議員剛才其實有特別有問到關於誒誒政府委任嗰個嘅比例，嗰即係嗰啲嘅誒委任人嘅獸醫嗰方面嗰個嘅專業。

476
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:19,130
咧，其實我諗係可能誒，我如果可以補充少少嘅話咧，就係香港嗰個嘅情況就係一般誒誒。剛才阿黃秘書長提到啦，如果係誒公共衞生咧，因為香港我哋基本上誒，如果要管理譬如農場嗰啲嘅動物啊，誒監管住誒食物衞生嗰方面嘅獸醫嗰方面嗰個嘅。

477
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:39,140
誒誒誒公誒公共獸醫衞生啦，我哋叫做都係其實全部都係來自公營機構嘅噉，所以過去咧，我哋會有一位嘅誒委任翻一位公職人員坐喺裏面咧，佢其實唔係代表緊話即係政府或者漁護署誒去坐喺個獸醫管理局，而係因為呢一方。

478
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:59,150
方面嗰個嘅專門嘅專業嘅知識咧，係喺誒坊間，因為大部分如果係喺外面執業嘅獸醫咧，可能大部分都係講緊一啲小嘅小型寵物，誒貓啊狗啊比較多啲嘅。咁而係講緊喺公共衞生呢個範疇咧，就基本上嗰個嘅專業知識或者。

479
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:19,160
嗰方面咧就會係保留咗喺公營機構裏面。咁另外一方面咧就誒誒一啲嘅動物，剛才其實誒出席嘅代表都有提到，譬如馬會誒，我哋有好多嘅賽馬啦。咁嗰個嘅即係專業知識係好專門嘅。咁另外大家其實頭先冇提到嘅一啲動物園裏面嘅動物啦，海洋公園啊。

480
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:39,170
誒或者誒其他嘅誒動物動物園啊，誒康文署嘅下嘅動物園啊等等，嗰啲嘅動物咧誒嘅即係嗰方面嘅專業知識咧，其實亦都係唔一樣嘅。咁所以喺嗰個委任嘅時候咧，其實而家睇翻即係嗰個背景咧，上一次因為會議。

481
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:59,180
嘅時候，誒議員冇要求嗰方面嘅資資料啦。咁所以我哋就淨係集中講咗，即係誒一啲非獸醫嗰個誒誒委任嘅人誒誒成員咧嗰個嘅背景。咁誒，所以變咗過去係委任嘅時候咧，都會確保翻有喺唔同嘅專業範疇。

482
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:19,190
嘅一啲嘅專家咧，係會被委任入去嗰個嘅誒管理局裏面。正如頭先講咗啦，因為嗰個管理局佢係需要去為住誒唔同範疇嘅獸醫服務啊個專業咧，去定定嗰個嘅誒標準嘅。咁所以我哋睇到嗰個背景，佢係需要對即係我哋希望嗰個成員嘅組合裏面。

483
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:39,200
咧係對唔同範疇嘅獸醫服務或者個獸醫專業咧都有相當嗰個嘅即係誒背景嘅。咁翻返去誒頭先嗰個文件裏面咧，上次誒委員咧亦都有誒要求我哋去提供翻咧誒我哋香港我哋而家建議嘅獸醫管理局同商海海外嘅獸醫專業嘅監。

484
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:59,210
管機構嗰個嘅成員組合個比例嘅嘅比較啦，同埋喺香港嘅其他誒自我規管嘅專業嘅誒監管機構嘅嗰啲嘅比例，咁呢一啲嘅誒詳細嘅資料咧，其實就已經喺文件嗰度即係羅列咗出嚟。噉我哋就即係喺呢度唔再誒唔重複咯。咁至於關

485
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:18,230
關於誒，剛才有提到嘅就係話喺個管理局裏面嘅一啲非誒，即係或者業外人士嗰個嘅背景啦。噉我哋就喺我哋嗰個嘅附件B嗰度咧，亦都有顯示咗出嚟嘅。咁誒，上次其實都有提到啦，喺我哋去誒考慮呢一啲嘅。

486
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:38,640
非業即係或者業外人士嗰個嘅誒考慮嘅時候咧，佢哋根據法例嗰個要求咧，就係話代表住呢一個會使用誒誒呢一個嘅獸醫服務嘅誒人嘅嘅誒，即係利益嘅。咁所以大部分咧，佢哋如果去睇翻嘅話，過咁多年咧，我哋都會盡量會有一啲。

487
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:58,650
寵物擁有人啦，誒，亦都會係一啲嘅誒動物福利諮詢小組，即係特別誒係關注動物福利嘅一啲嘅代表啦，以及一啲嘅誒愛護動物協會嘅誒代表會喺裡面嘅。咁嗰啲咧就會係大家一路都好關注，就話希望一啲嘅愛護動物團體嘅代

488
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:18,660
代表誒可以即係會誒即係誒喺獸醫局裏面咧係會有呢個代表嘅。咁喺過去我哋去委任嘅時候咧，都會有考慮呢一啲嘅代表咯。咁誒另外有一兩位嘅有家禽學會嘅會長啦，亦都有即係誒馬主理事會嘅理事啦。噉佢哋就會係即係誒針對住一啲。

489
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:26,190
啲家用誒或者一啲食用動物咯，誒同埋馬方面啦嘅，即係使用各方面嘅服務嘅代表嘅。

490
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:47,810
咁至於誒處理投訴嗰個嘅誒時間啦，同埋誒嗰個程序咧，其實剛才啊黃秘書長喺回應誒誒業界代表嘅嘅誒問題啊，同埋嗰個嘅意見嘅時候咧，都已經有討論咗啦。咁誒喺呢一方面，我就唔再重複。

491
01:38:49,580 --> 01:39:09,590
咁去到誒另一方面，就係上次議員好關心嘅，就係當誒我哋擴大咗誒獸醫管理局嗰個成員嘅人數同埋組合之後咧，會唔會即係可以加快到嗰個嘅誒誒案誒案件嘅處理嘅時候咧？咁會唔會喺秘書處方面嗰個嘅？

492
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:29,600
嘅誒人手咧反而唔足夠咧，咁喺呢一度我哋其實都有交代咗咧，就誒嗰個秘書處其實就誒係即係專專門咧去為呢一個獸醫管理局去服務嘅，咁但係喺行政架構上咧，佢哋就設喺漁護處裡面嘅，咁其實漁護處一路咧都會留意住誒管理。

493
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:49,610
個秘書處嗰個人數嘅人手夠唔夠啦？如果唔足夠嘅話咧，其實我哋亦都會按照翻政府內部嗰個嘅即係資源分配嗰個嘅安排咧，去爭取一啲即係增撥資源嘅。咁喺二零一二年咧，我哋就增設咗一名嘅高級行政主任嘅職位啦，同埋一個嘅二。

494
01:39:49,610 --> 01:40:09,620
二級行政主任嘅職位，咁整體而家秘書處咧嗰個嘅人數咧就係有誒十名嘅嘅人手去誒支援嘅。咁誒日後咧，我哋都會繼續即係留意住嗰個人手嗰個嘅需要啦。如果係真係有需要嘅時候咧，我哋都會喺內部去爭取翻資源。

495
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,060
去處理嘅。

496
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:34,180
咁最後一方面咧，就係上次委員咧又問到關於喺處理嗰個紀律處分嗰個程序嘅時候咧，包括係咪誒嗰個言訊係咪公開咯，同埋誒相關人士係咪可以有律師嘅代表嘅？咁呢一方面嘅資料咧，我哋就白誒喺附件D嗰度即係誒羅列咗出嚟嘅。咁簡。

497
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:54,190
單嚟講咧，喺香港獸醫管理管理局嘅情況咧，就係啊，而家法例寫明嘅啦，就係喺言訊委員會咧係有權準許或者禁止公眾或者任何個別公眾人士喺言訊嘅時候在場嘅。咁誒，即係佢會按情況去做嗰個決定咯。而根據翻獸醫管理局個紀律。

498
01:40:54,190 --> 01:41:14,200
處分程序咧，就言訊嘅任何一方咧都可以有律師或者大律師嘅代表出席嘅。咁呢一個情況其實我哋睇翻同其他喺誒本地嘅其他嘅專業監管機構嘅情況，其實大致相同。誒，例如即係我哋睇咗嘅醫務委員會啊、藥劑業誒，又或者牙醫管理委員會。

499
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,510
等等，好，誒，主席，噉我介紹就到呢度。

500
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:20,360
仲有冇其他官員有嘢補充？

501
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,390
誒，張麗雲。

502
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:38,790
啊，主席啊，我都想再問一問清楚政府方面咧，就係嗱，過去咧就誒誒，通通都係委任㗎啦，係咪十名成員都係委任啦？咁而家咧你就增加到十九位，噉你可唔可以再講清楚咧？

503
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:49,060
點解你增加呢十九位嘅其中有六位會變咗做係授意互選產生嘅咧？即係個嗰個原因同埋個動機何在？唔該。

504
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,910
誒，黃生。

505
01:41:51,190 --> 01:42:11,200
主席，我哋主要個考慮點咧，都係希望，即係即係覺得咧，就個首頁喺香港發展嘅階段咧，我哋覺得適宜咧，即係讓佢哋有誒選舉產生嘅成員咧。我我哋希望透過呢呢樣嘢咧，係誒創造空間啦，等即係業業內人士係係有可以更加積極咁參與即係管理誒。

506
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,120
自己嘅事務啊，咁呢個係我我哋個主要嘅原因嚟嘅。

507
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:35,060
仲有冇跟進？有啊，主席，即係其實咧，因為啱啱咧，我問嗰啲問題咧，其實啱啱與會者都有人答咗啦。譬如我話會唔會咧導致到啊，第日啲啊，即係費用或者貴啊，或者首爾供應不足啊等等嘅問題咧，噉佢就唔會。即係而家我哋其實香港嘅費用都好平㗎啦，噉。

508
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:55,070
咁其實好平嘅原因咧，就係而家呢個制度之下咧，咁咧就誒，即係所以誒，即係嗰個嗰個醫生供應量係足嘅。咁咧就誒，好似你啱啱講咧一比千二啦，係咪呢個呢呢個數目咧係誒，即係醫生嘅誒呢獸醫嘅量係對翻動物嚟講係高嘅。

509
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:58,680
所以呢個係好嘅，對市民大眾係歡迎嘅。

510
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:05,460
噉你而家無端端白事，你而家又擴大呢個委員會，而擴大委員會裏邊阿主席。

511
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:25,750
即係你做加民選成分，你大家都知道啦。你獸醫互選產生，你梗係互相維護翻啲獸醫㗎嘛？阿主席，你明唔明啊？所以我就要知道，嗱，你要改一條法例唔緊要，我我哋好多時都會支持政府，但係你一定要講得服我，係咩原因呢？啱唔啱啊？你而家唔止加咗。

512
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:42,380
改咗一條法例，你同埋咧，你仲要將呢一個啊當中嘅一個成員比例就由佢哋獸醫自己互選產生入嚟嘅話，咁會唔會反而導致而家呢一個啊自由機制更好嘅，設更好嘅機制會變得更差咧？

513
01:43:43,420 --> 01:44:03,430
即係你咪講緊，你反對有呢個誒互選產生嗰六位嘅嘅制度，你想佢委任埋係咪？唔係，我只係想希望咧，就係政府方面能夠畀到一個啊，即係合理嘅答案。我哋即係我起碼，我哋代表市民嘅人喺呢度，我哋都要話畀大家。

514
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:23,440
張麗雲，我諗佢答咗你，不過你未必中意佢答案啫。噉我哋有其他同事又即係冇答案啊嘛，主席，你明唔明啊？咁咪佢解釋咗個畀你聽點解佢要繼續有委？佢講解釋咩嘢啊？繼續有互選啦，黃生，你再解釋多啲。咁咪係咯，點解你有委任有？佢認為喎。我聽佢解釋咗，不過我唔想代。

515
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:43,450
佢再解釋畀你聽啫。係誒噉啊，黃生你講啦。誒，我再重申一次啦，就係我哋係考慮咗即係呢個誒業界喺過去嗰十幾年嘅發展啦。因為誒誒，大大家都知而家佢個行業都發展到係有成誒超過七百人啦。咁嚟考慮到誒香港而家嗰個即係整體情況，特別係誒，我諗主要。

516
01:44:43,450 --> 01:45:03,460
個法例嘅主要個個個目標咧，其實係喺即係要確保我哋有即係誒好嘅誒即係服務啦嚇。咁誒，我哋考慮咗呢一欄自己因素之後咧，我哋覺得係適宜咧，係喺係喺喺喺我哋擴擴充嗰個嗰個誒成員嘅時候咧，係引入呢一個誒誒誒呢個。

517
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:12,410
自選嘅嘅嘅成員咧，係鼓勵業界咧能夠更加積極咁參與咧，係管理翻誒自己嘅事務嘅。咁呢個係個嗰個主要嘅原因嚟。

518
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:21,130
咁即係主席，佢你而家嘅話咧，啲誒誒誒，即係誒管理局就冇咁誒積極去管理翻自己嘅內部事務咩？

519
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,940
黃生。

520
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:43,990
誒呢個誒，我我我誒，我我答覆就係話，即係點解要引入咁引入？我我哋希其實係有少誒有有一啲係向前看咧。噉我哋其實係希望即係業界咧係即係更加多人咧係去去自己落實落腳去，即係誒睇睇翻自己事務。噉我哋誒睇。

521
01:45:43,990 --> 01:46:04,000
畀翻其他誒，譬如話係海外即係成功嘅一啲一啲個案，都有一啲都係當佢哋發展到某個階段嘅時候，你其實佢都會引入一啲即係誒自選嘅成員嘅噉。我我哋其實睇考呢個問題時都有有有參考呢啲呢啲做法啦。咁誒，特特別我哋睇過嘅。

522
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:24,180
誒有比較即係即係成功嘅例子，譬如話，又係誒英國、澳洲啊，等等誒紐西蘭等等嘅地方，呢啲呢啲地方佢哋發展到咁上下嘅時候，咧其實佢都會引入嗰個即係即係選舉個嗰個成員嘅。噉我哋覺得呢個呢個做法，可能喺香港都係誒誒係時候要要要做啦。咁誒再睇翻就係。

523
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:31,250
誒，今天嗰個誒行業發展到個個個規模咧，我哋覺得都係適合適合咁做嘅，多謝。

524
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:51,710
張麗雲，啊，主席啊，嗱，即係管理局咧。假如話誒，即係我誒政府認為啊，我哋應該啊呢個開放啲，趁管理局咧有更多嘅獸醫入嚟咧，就係參與個管理嚇，趁啲獸醫咧就互相咧，亦都係啊嚴格啲。

525
01:46:51,710 --> 01:47:11,720
係嘛，即係啊，做好佢哋嘅服務工作，我係支持嘅，點會唔支持咧？但問題在點解當中你就要獸醫，大家有互選咧？係咪咁？換言之嚟講，而家即係其實呢個係一個大問題啦，係咪噉啊？因因為你過去唔使選之下，你都係服務得幾好啊，而

526
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:31,730
而家要選嘅話，OK，咁點解？對唔住，對唔住，阿阿陳志全議員，你你未走住我，我想等佢，我我想問問，十二月大家可唔可以開開會？我我都唔想話等到尾，我先問，好冇？我知你想走，阿蔣麗雲議員，你你等等先，我畀人畀人你問啊嘛，因為秘書又講咗，我哋十二月二號有一個。

527
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:51,740
會咁跟住咧，我哋就要到下個月嘅一月。但十二月十九號咧，其實就有個空檔，唔知道大家十九號會唔會喺香港，同埋朝頭早嗰個十點九，大家有冇時間？咁又唔使隔成五個禮拜就開第二個會。誒，大家十二月十。

528
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:53,880
九號十點九得唔得？

529
01:47:55,340 --> 01:48:13,280
陳志全議員，得。阿陳家樂議員，阿撞發展，不過應該得嘅，冇問題，坐得到。發展開到十一點，都得，應該得嘅，都得。唔該。蔣麗雲議員，你得唔得？我冇問題，主席。好嘅，噉我哋加多十二月十九個會啊！唔該曬，陳志全議員。阿蔣麗雲議員，你繼續啦。

530
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:35,800
O.K.，主席咁咧就嗯，我哋即係一定要啊瞭解。當我哋要改一條法例嘅話咧，就一定係基於過去喺過去嘅基礎上都做。噉我哋一定知道咧，過去咧呢個法例行使期間咧有啲乜嘢嘢做得唔好嘅嚇，唔好嘅嘢我哋先至要改善。

531
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:55,810
係嘛噉，但係而家嘅話，我就唔知過去有啲咩做得唔好嘅係嘛。噉你假如答我政府答我話啊，我哋加多啲人，O.K.，我係支持揾多啲，因為而家多咗獸醫嘛，係咪咁？你多啲獸醫嘅話，咁誒誒加入呢個管理局誒一齊去去工作，我係支持㗎嚇噉。

532
01:48:55,810 --> 01:49:15,820
咁但係問題在你話當中有部分要改為啊，獸醫互選，OK咁咧就唔要接受委任。噉我就有一個質疑啦，因為其實點解咩事咧，主席啊？因為其實我都好驚，你知而家香港點解醫療系統其實咧，而家有時醫生唔夠啊，你去到啲公立醫院各方面等等。

533
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:35,830
咧，即係好牙煙嘅，OK？點解咧？其實大家無可否認咧，其實醫生之間，OK？譬如話你嗰個啊，即係嗰個誒誒，都係有啲醫療隔，即係醫生佢哋嘅組織係有一啲保護主義存在㗎，OK？地方保護主義存在，咁所以因此咧，即係我覺得啊，我哋一定要好小心。

534
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:55,840
處理咗呢一樣嘢，唔係話誒有啲國家開放喎，噉我哋又開放咧噉。噉你又話畀我聽有幾多國家唔開放啦？係咪啊？嘛開放有咩好處啊？即係你要同公眾交代㗎嘛？係咪？我覺得你唔唔知點解你要噉樣改？我真係好驚，到時啲貓貓狗狗。

535
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:03,740
即係睇醫生嘅費用就會昂貴。而家唔仲未話叫做好貴，但係你噉樣搞法，日後可能就昂貴啦嘛。

536
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,610
黃生。

537
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:24,610
誒主席，或者我嘗試即係再即係吞下少睇睇個問題啦，即係如果我理解冇錯啊，張議員個問題咧就係話，即係究竟喺嗰個誒委員會上邊嗰個誒嗰個專業同埋非專業嗰個比例咧？噉我我我我覺得我哋。

538
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:45,090
前一陣都已經講咗嗰個，即係討論咗，就係我我哋睇嗰個比例應該係都係維持翻二比一，即係而家個問題咧就喺個二裏邊喺呢個二裏邊咧就係點點樣去即係即係揾呢啲人咁解嘅啫。咁誒答翻阿長官嘅問題咧，其實如果如果大家都接受嗰個二比一係一個即係適合比例，即係話呢個。

539
01:50:45,090 --> 01:51:05,100
而而正正係呢一個比例，呢個比例過去咧。啊，主席，我唔係話二比一，你搞清楚。我嗱二比一咧，我都冇乜所謂。OK嚇，我我唔介意。OK，因為咧，即係啊，多啲業界嘅人士，佢哋瞭解問題，我同意㗎。但係問題在你話啊，獸醫啊，其中。

540
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:12,490
加嗰六位係由互選產生呢一樣嘢咧，我就係啊有保留嘅，阿主席真係有保留，因為咧。

541
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:22,810
假如互選產生嘅任何嘅一個啊被選出嚟嘅代表，佢個責任咧就一個嘅啫，維護受醫權益。

542
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,770
你明唔明啊？咁呢個係就係我擔心嘅。

543
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:47,580
你嘅擔心同埋你有保留，即係你重複咗好多次。噉我都唔係好介意，因為我原先咧多啲時間，我想入去逐逐條審議嘅。但係而家得翻幾分鐘咧，我就唔去做呢樣嘢。不過你即係你你要明一樣嘢，我哋有啲同事就係覺得所有嘢人要選，你又覺得所有人。

544
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:52,140
要被委任，咁大家有唔同嘅意見咧，我覺得即係係。

545
01:51:52,480 --> 01:52:12,490
即係得嘅，我覺得何秀蘭議員分分鐘都對佢條條內有保留。點解有六個委任咧？你係有保留。點解有六個選出嚟咧？咁唔緊要，大家有保留。咁去到投票嘅時間咧，我哋就去投票。不過我哋法例仍仍然要審議，即係你你講咗幾次都係咁㗎啦，好嘛？大家如果同事冇其他，

546
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:32,500
問題嘅咧，我諗我哋今日個時間都都幾夠㗎啦。咁咧就誒，我就留翻下次咧，我哋就作條審議啦，好嘛？即係十月二號同十月十九號嗰個時間。十月二號咧就係呢個星期二嘅誒八點三十分。

547
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,110
啊，係。

548
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:54,400
大家上次講咗嘅十月二號八點三十分喺二A房，咁跟住我哋再加多個會，十月十九號就係喺呢個誒十點九，咁變咗咧。如果我哋好彩嘅咧，我哋就可以呢個今年度可能殺科。不過我想問問政府咧就。

549
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:02,620
你正話講個選舉辦法有resolution啦，即係我陳家洛議員都講，你遲下會有resolution啊！我想問你呢條條例過咗。

550
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:10,120
你個醫管局嗰個成員幾時？你諗住會跟個新嘅法例去做啊？

551
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:25,800
噉你就跟住個resolution。嗰個誒簡單嚟講咧，嗰個我哋要分期咁做，我哋要首先即係過咗嗰啲誒。唔係你你首先要過咗條條例先啦。係啊，過咗條例，然後就過咗條例之後幾耐，你會改變呢個。

552
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,960
個醫管局嘅成員啊！

553
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:32,020
講緊獸醫管理局。係獸醫管理局。

554
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:53,010
誒係啊，因為誒，我哋要會有即係，如果誒立法會同意會有呢一個選任嘅時候咧，其實就要做嗰個選舉，我哋先可以有一個新嘅即係獸醫管理局產生到出嚟嘅。咁所以誒，根據我哋而家嗰個期望咧，誒呢一個大嘅誒主體法例咧，就係畀咗個授權。

555
01:53:53,010 --> 01:54:13,020
啊！食物及衞生局局長可以去做嗰個嘅附屬法例，咁所以下一步即係當呢一個生效之後咧，噉我哋就會做嗰個附屬法例啦。咁個附屬法例係另一個嘅即係立法程序嚟，咁所以我哋都會即係需要有諮詢同埋去翻即係事務委員會。即係你咪話畀我知，我哋通過咗呢條條例，仲需要啲，可能都要N年因。

556
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:33,030
係你要睇下個選舉條例幾時拎resolution嚟？我你係咪噉樣聽到啊？係係我所以點解要我知你咁問題？我代你問佢。而家佢答我咧，我就覺得好似講緊any即有呢個resolution啱唔啱嘛？主席，我我係其實代表緊你哋去，即係我我聽緊佢講嘢，不過我唔明佢哋講。

557
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:53,040
主席，其實我哋誒喺即係誒通報即係事務委員會嗰方面，其實我哋都有個計劃。我哋希望係喺出年第一季咧誒左右咧，可以將嗰個即係附屬法例嗰個嘅方案咧交上誒事務委員會討論。咁如果一切順利，咁因為嗰個即係如果即係立法會同意。

558
01:54:53,040 --> 01:55:13,050
我哋嗰個建議啦嚇，就誒會係以一個嘅先定立後審議嘅程序嘅。咁所以我哋希望係。你你都仲係未聞聽到我問你個問題。其實我好簡單，我哋知道你點做嘢嘅。我而家想問你就係你個袋係咪已經袋咗？第二日嗰個選舉呢六個人嗰個嘅機制，你想點做？

559
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:33,060
係咪可能你嗰條resolution已經寫緊係咪咁？你一定有個諮詢㗎嘛？我當我哋十九號搞掂咗呢條條例，即係我哋十九號審完啦。可能一月我哋就二讀三讀過埋啦。O.K.噉我而家就想問你，噉你過完咗呢條條例，你幾時會去諮詢啲受？

560
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:53,070
獸醫啊，我哋啊，第日個選舉方法係點做咁諮詢完，你先搦個resolution上嚟，有個negative voting啊嘛。咁呢個時間你預咗幾耐？咁跟住嗰個新管理局個獸醫管理局啲人可以變咧。噉你你其實我而家問緊你個有冇個時間表喺度啫嘛？粗略地。

561
01:55:53,070 --> 01:56:13,080
有個時間表嘅。剛才其實講緊，我哋希望係明年嘅第一季可以做嗰個諮詢，同埋同呢一個事務委員會去做嗰個諮詢啦。咁如果順利之後嘅話，噉就可以希望係年中之前咧就會可以即係上到嗰個嘅通過通。Negative vetting啊，係嘅，Negative vetting係嗰個係。

562
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:33,090
係誒附屬法例嚟嘅，附屬法例啦。啊，咁但係呢個如果過咗之後，其實就已經係嗰個管理據，就可以就可以進行可以進行過曬呢啲就可以進行選舉，就進行選舉，係啦，就可以做呢樣嘢啦，係啦，包括登記授醫。咁所以呢個新嘅授醫管理局喺我嚟講，唔。

563
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:48,870
唔會早過二零一六年可以會有新嘅組合咧，係咪根據呢條條例嘅組合咧？可以噉樣講，可能需要都係咪先？你都要，你都要選舉嘅話，可能講緊都要十二月間啦，係咪啊？合理啊，O K。

564
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:53,550
啊，係薛守義。

565
01:56:54,660 --> 01:57:14,670
想補充少少資料畀阿蔣議員嘅，關於頭先你講到話收費嘅問題咧，其實咧響授於註冊授於實務守則裏邊咧，亦都規定咧啊，有個啊註冊嘅授於咧要要遵守呢個收費嘅原則嘅，唔可以啊啊收費太高。如果佢收費，

566
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:21,580
係太高咧，或者係超速啊，超出某一啲收費咧，亦都係要受到嗰個紀律嘅嘅處分嘅。

567
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:42,030
何秀蘭議員係啊，主席嗱一我追嘅政府保文件咧，就係過去佢委任嗰六名獸醫係誒，即係係邊個範圍嘅人啦。第二咧，主席，我就頭先聽見政府官員話又先定立後審議嗰個即係選舉辦法。喂，其實即係而家都已經十一月啦，我哋即係都都目標。

568
01:57:42,030 --> 01:58:02,040
要十二月十九號去審完，佢明年可以諮詢。其實佢有個底稿，唔該你攞埋出嚟先啦。同埋，我想政府答點解你要先定立後審議咧？即係業界到時可能都好大意見。你點解唔喺做今次呢一個呢一個法例嘅時候，即係你你要攞住呢個權力咧？點解你唔可以？

569
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:12,100
我諗我哋啲議員多意見過啲業界，聽啲業界又待住先唔緊要，嚇！即係多啲人好辦事。

570
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:32,390
O.K.，問得啊！誒，政府你下次答埋啦，好嘛？主席，即係我我請政府畀翻，即係畀翻書面答案。我我諗你可以講埋畀我哋聽，你已經有冇一樣嘢喺度咧？咁當然而家有。如果你有，你就攞埋出嚟。啊，有演員攞埋噉，我哋可以同一時間大家睇，都阻慢咗我哋呢個審議呢度。我哋都都還是都係case by case，下次。

571
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:52,400
啊，同埋點解你要先定立後審議咧？嗰個嗱，我諗呢個你已經喺呢度噏咗㗎啦，啱唔啱啊？其實好多人都噏過，係根本唔係好中意negative vetting呢樣嘢嘅。係咯，噉我而家晨早就啱啊！即係我我再講嘅，唔係淨係呢條條例，好多條條例大家都好唔中意negative vetting嘅，包括。

572
01:58:52,400 --> 01:59:12,410
佢自由黨O.K.陳家洛議員，我哋仲有一分鐘。誒主席，多謝我諗，亦都係就住嗰個嘅誒選舉辦法嗰個審議嘅程序方面，我希望政府聽聽我哋嘅意見啦。即係既然有底稿，盡快攞出嚟。如果有嘅話，即係下次可以喺從條審邊嘅時候睇埋最好，因為去到嗰度都會問㗎啦。係咪你話by regulation咩regulation點樣做？咁另外咧喺。

573
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:32,420
嗰個回應文件當中咧有兩點，希望都補充一下啦。下次可能書面答咧，時間不足啦。就住C嗰度咧，你畀咗個平均嘅處理一個個案嘅月數，即係譬如十六宗，係嘛？就係講緊零七年到誒二零一一年期間噉。噉我諗我哋做誒做統計嗰啲都會想知道埋個range，即係最快係幾多個？

574
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:52,430
月嘅case最耐嘅case係幾多個月咧？咁先得出一個嘅平均數嘅十六個月呢一個噉樣嘅數字咧？咁咁另外就住人手嗰度咧，我上次都有擔心到嗰個嘅即係工作壓力嘅問題。噉我多謝你話畀我知，而家有十個喺處裏邊嘅，即係喺嗰個漁護處裏邊嘅一個秘書處，噉啊一位秘書帶住好多嘅幫手咧。咁但係法律

575
01:59:52,430 --> 02:00:12,440
顧問始終只係得一位嘅，即係主席，我就擔心即係嗰個即係誒工作量方面係點樣樣咧。佢應該唔係處裏邊嘅人員嚟㗎啦，法律顧問係嘛噉就由即係誒局長委任嘅。咁所以呢方面我都想即係關心一下，到底誒喺嚟緊呢一個條例修定之後有啲咩辦法，會唔會咧都有一個機會去增加即係法律顧問嗰個嘅人。

576
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:18,660
手去應付嗰個PIC，即係嗰個啊調查嘅工作，誒新增嘅壓力咧，多謝主席。

577
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:23,870
O.K.，噉我哋誒對唔住啊，周麗雯議員，我哋過咗鐘，好嘛？

578
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:40,610
咩話？我淨係想咧，就希望咧，誒，因為我就提咗出嚟，O K，我話話，假如你加咗嚇呢六個選互選嘅獸醫嘅話，有啲咩唔好處，我就提咗我嘅意見出嚟。但係始終咧，即係我覺得誒，政府方面咧，你都要。

579
02:00:40,890 --> 02:01:00,900
話畀我聽，你話多呢六個選舉互選產生嘅獸醫誒入管理局有什麼好處？喂，噉我都可以話畀市民聽。喂，其實好好㗎，加咗有啲咩好處？咩好處啊？即係我可以同人講嘛。而家我諗唔到有好處喎，只有壞處。你過咗時間啦，長榮院阿黃生，你睇下你可唔可以覆埋？

580
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:19,210
話畀蔣麗雲聽，點解你有呢個噉嘅決定？有六個選舉，有六個委任啦嘛。好啊，或者我用文字再再交代一次。我諗你盡快下個誒畀到文件，我哋你聽到我諗呢個條例唔係咁困難，我哋亦都有個時間表，都希望幫你完成佢。咁所以你唔好拖我哋啦。
