1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
交由內務委員會處理。

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:18,660
本會現在恢復二零一四年司法雜項條文條例草案嘅二讀辯論，審議上述條例草案嘅委員會主席郭榮亨議員就委員會嘅報告向本會發言，郭榮亨議員。

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:40,710
Thank you, Acting President. In my capacity as the chairman of the Bills Committee on Administration of Justice Miscellaneous Provisions Bill Two Thousand and Fourteen, I like to report on the major deliberations of the Bills Committee. The Bills Committee has held four meetings with the administration and the judiciary administration to examine the bill which.

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:01:00,720
seeks to amend various legislation to implement various proposals relating to the administration of justice. The Bills Committee notes that Part Two of the bill amends the definition of live television link by replacing the reference to a closed circuit television system by audiovisual facilities in the evidence taking process.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:20,730
process for criminal proceedings. Some members have relayed the concern of the Hong Kong Bar Association about the security issue that may arise from replacing the expression closed-circuit television system by audio-visual facilities. These members have suggested that the judiciary should consider the drafting of the proposed amendment to the.

6
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,620
事實上，同意刑事法院使用者委員會，應在任何設施之前尋求。

7
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:46,950
Regardless of the technology use, could be introduced by the judiciary in the evidence-taking process. According to the judiciary administration, the users committee is a non-statutory committee. The judiciary does not consider it appropriate to prescribe in the law the role of this committee relating to the choice of audiovisual facilities.

8
00:01:46,950 --> 00:02:06,960
為address members' concern， a committee stage amendment will be moved to the effect that such facilities should be subject to the approval by the chief justice. Administratively， the judiciary will seek views from the relevant parties， including the users' committee and others， for the chief justice' consideration before.

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:26,970
他的 approval， the administration has also agreed to introduce committee stage amendments to address the bill's committee's concern about the textual inconsistency between the Chinese version and the English version of the proposed amendments regarding the definition of live television link and to refine the drafting of the legislative.

10
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:46,980
有關條文，有鑑於成員的意見，法案委員會指出，法案的第4部分修訂了地方法院法令，以便判決的理由可以以口頭或書面形式交付，而判決的理由則繼續以口頭形式交付，之後再轉為書面。一些成員認為，有關修訂允許。

11
00:02:46,980 --> 00:03:06,990
給地區法官彈性，以釐定刑事程序中判決理由的寫法，直接而無偏袒被告人的權利。這些成員也指出，司法機構應考慮釐定有關因素，應由地區法官決定判決理由的傳達方式。

12
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:24,140
Given the members' preference and after careful consideration, the judiciary has agreed that it was set out by way of a practice direction the relevant factors that a district judge may consider when deciding whether the reasons for verdict should be delivered orally first or directly in writing.

13
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:44,430
一些成員在法案委員會建議，一份關於判決的理由，直接以文字形式提供給公眾，透過互聯網。此外，關於判決的口頭理由，然後轉為文字，應該以類似的方式發佈，就像直接以文字形式發佈一樣。

14
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:53,150
By way of making a copy of such reasons to the public through the internet, the administration has agreed to move committee stage amendments to this effect.

15
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,610
the bills committee notes that.

16
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:15,900
Part five of the bill repeals a section of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ordinance to abolish the existing as of right appeal mechanism for civil causes or matters to the Court of Final Appeal and make certain consequential amendments thereto. Some members have expressed reservation about the proposed abolition of the as of

17
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:35,910
Right arrangements for civil appeals. Some members note that if the as of right appeal mechanism is to be abolished, leave to appeal to the court of final appeal will only be allowed if, in the opinion of the court of appeal or the court of final appeal, the questions involved is one which, by reason of great general or public importance or otherwise.

18
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,430
或要被提交至四分之一的審裁庭作出決定。

19
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:48,420
這些成員批評指出，因素可能被考慮由法官在或否則條款下應被明確列出。在這種情況下，

20
00:04:48,860 --> 00:05:07,300
The judiciary has advised that in other comparable common law jurisdiction, there is no automatic right of appeal to the highest court. The judiciary has also examined the relevant cases and sum up the factors and circumstances under which leave has been granted under the or otherwise limb.

21
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:18,960
can broadly be grouped into three categories. These include legal errors causing grave injustice, relatively important subject matters and miscellaneous matters.

22
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,520
司法界強調，決定批出留學許可。

23
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:43,060
通常，通常，fact specific，任何 categorisation of the factors or circumstances under which leave was granted by the court can only be a broad guide. If the bill is passed under commencement of the Part Five, all appeals in civil matters to the Court of Final Appeal would be subject to.

24
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,770
discretionary leave.

25
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,690
Acting President, next, I would like to give my personal views on.

26
00:05:49,970 --> 00:06:09,980
the issue concerning the appeal to the court of final appeal. This bill raises important issues relating to the administration of justice. This includes allowing the use of more advanced audiovisual technologies in the evidence-taking process for criminal proceedings, which we have just touched on. And on behalf of

27
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:24,940
法律 profession， I'm especially grateful for the administration's acceptance of my suggestion to move a CSA to ensure that the reasons for the verdict for cases in the district court would be made available to the public through the internet.

28
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:43,100
我認為這會對律師業、客户以及一般公眾都極為有幫助。不幸的是，這項法案並非沒有爭議。特別是，正如我所提到的，關於廢除上訴機制的議點，受到一些懷疑。

29
00:06:43,380 --> 00:07:03,390
It must be acknowledged that the reservations raised against the proposal are not without merits or logic, as as of right civil appeals alleviate the restrictions from existing rights of appeal, which is a matter of particular concern to litigants in this jurisdiction. For instance, I note that a

30
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:23,400
一數個民事上訴達至CFA，透過《上訴權》條文，根據《香港終審法院上訴條例》第22條第1節A項。在2012年，27個民事案件在CFA上訴，6個是上訴權上訴，共。

31
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,970
這些六個案件，兩個是成功的。

32
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:46,370
The as-of-right appeal mechanism is also consistent with Article 35 of the Basic Law, which provides for the right to access to courts and judicial remedies. While the court of the court of appeal safeguards this right, there is a sentiment that all avenues of legal recourse should be pursued before justice is considered.

33
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,280
要被 serve。

34
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,690
although I'm sympathetic with litigants who share this point of view.

35
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:12,010
It must be remembered that limitations of appeal to the CFA serve the legitimate purpose of enabling our top court to focus only on judgments which are of particular importance. In fact, not only is there doubt as to whether an as of right appeal mechanism founded on the one million dollar monetary threshold

36
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:20,310
can help secure proper and efficient administration of justice. It may even make matters worse for the following reasons.

37
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,690
Number one.

38
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:40,580
The appeal mechanism is objectionable by principle. The one million monetary, one million dollar monetary threshold is an arbitrary figure, which establishes an exclusive privilege to appeal. This suggests unacceptably, in my view, that monetary figures give rise to rights.

39
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,030
when the

40
00:08:42,310 --> 00:09:02,320
CFA ordinance was passed in 1995. There was a proposal to repeal the as of right mechanism for this very reason. It was not repealed at that time, primarily because the then AG claimed that such a move would be a radical departure from the then existing system of appeals to the Privy Council. As we know, Hong Kong.

41
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:17,270
司法已經成熟，顯著地改變，自那時起，並需並行的變革，以適應這些發展。第二，上訴機制在現代司法體係中是奇怪的。

42
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:37,560
As of right, appeals to the highest appellate court are not features in the legal system of common law jurisdictions that are comparable to Hong Kong. Leave must be obtained for appellate cases to the Australian High Court, to the New Zealand Supreme Court and the UK Supreme Court. In Canada, leave to appeal has been required in most.

43
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:57,570
cases since 1975. While Singapore and Ireland retain as of right appeals, it is because their judiciaries do not have intermediate appellate court. As a matter of fact, the Singapore Court of Appeal has explained that as a general rule, there should only be one tier of appeal.

44
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,010
係一啲嘅問題。

45
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:19,300
Thirdly, not only does the appeal mechanism lead to an ineffective appeals system, but it also unnecessarily drains judicial resources. For instance, the as of right appeal mechanism has repeatedly led to situation where the CFA has had to consider and hear unmeritorious appeals.

46
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:39,340
這些 cases benefit neither the respondents nor the appellants, and only serve to increase the legal costs for litigants. More importantly, they lead to delays or possible appeal denials of hearings of meritorious cases. Unmeritorious cases have regularly been held by

47
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,220
由司法，係一啲嘅嘩費，既司法資源同時間。

48
00:10:46,380 --> 00:11:06,390
Acting President, the judiciary has frequently pointed out that the as of right appeal mechanism would often give rise to problems in actual practice. Last September, the Chief Justice dismissed an as of right appeal, saying that in the judgment that if leave to appeal had been required, there is no.

49
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:19,310
無 doubt that such leave would not have been granted for this case. He also remarked that this is yet another all too common example of an unmeritorious appeal which has reached the CFA by this.

50
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,600
Route.

51
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:34,600
The chief justice's criticism echoes the sentiments of other CFA judges, such as Justice Ribeiro, who accurately observed that the role of the CFA isn't to let litigants have a third bite of the cherry.

52
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:55,200
last but not least, the as of right appeals create room for an abuse of the process. It makes it possible for litigants with more financial resources to bring the case and litigate matters all the way up to the CFA, regardless of the merits or the issues involved in the case, just to gamble on the possibility that the other.

53
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:15,210
誰，會可能較少財富或較少資源，會無法確保足夠資源來請律師辯護案件，直至上訴至CFA，從而導致早期和解。考慮到香港現有的經濟不平等，這

54
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,600
Fortunately, happens way more often than one could imagine.

55
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:33,060
你可見從這些點，如何作為上訴，對於民事事務妨礙我們的司法系統，和是壓抑，甚麼時候是壓抑，對訴訟者，如果在上訴法院贏了兩次。

56
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:54,050
一次在高等法院第一審，第二次在高等法院上訴。它等於顯而易見，如何這些爭議引發不公義，由拒絕更多有 meritous，如果不是數字上較不重要的案件，進入CFA。法律應該不應該更傾向於那些有財力利用法院程序的人？

57
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:07,820
The time to abolish the right appeal mechanism for civil matters is long overdue, and the court of last resort should be permitted to conduct affairs befitting to its purpose and serve litigants equally.

58
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:14,370
作為end note，我會想説，很多我的同事，包括那些在民協內。

59
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:34,660
belief that the test for the CFA leave to CFA is excessively strict and should be revisited. I'm talking about the leave to appeal mechanism. However, I'm equally of the view that this concern can be addressed without compromising the bill. A practical remedy is to elaborate.

60
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:54,670
on the or otherwise ground of leave as per section 22, subsection 1, subsection B of the existing ordinance, as opposed to the part of the provision covering leave for matters of great general or public importance, or otherwise is comparatively vague and unclear. The judiciary has come up with

61
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:14,680
以一般定義，這或那種，包括三類案件：第一，法律錯誤造成嚴重不公或不同結果；第二，相對重要的主題；第三，雜項事項，與其他法院命令有關。

62
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:34,780
但係，一much more detailed explanation and jurisprudence is desirable and necessary for future development of our current judicial appeal system. This is especially clear when one compares with the tests adopted in foreign jurisdiction. For instance, neither the High Court of Australia nor the Supreme Court of Canada

63
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:54,790
Canada，phrase grounds of appeal in such loose terms as or otherwise quote and unquote。在高等法院，澳洲的司法權力賦予高等法院有責任決定一個法律問題是否需要由最終上訴法院來解決不同法院之間或同一法院內的意見分歧，或者是否需要考慮到當事人的利益。

64
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:14,800
Administration of justice require consideration by the High Court in granting leave. Similarly, in Canada, the Supreme Court grants leave if it is of the opinion that, by reason of the importance of any issue or law, or mixed law and fact involved in that question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme Court or is for.

65
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:22,770
或任何其他 reason of such nature or significant as to warrant decision by the Canadian Supreme Court.

66
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:31,970
Ultimately, the threshold for leave should be mitigated to ensure that litigants are not deprived of access to Hong Kong's highest court of appeal.

67
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:52,270
Reference to foreign legislation can inform the expansion of the or otherwise ground of appeal, so as to relax the present stringent tests currently imposed by the CFA. It is to be hoped that with the passage of this bill, the judiciary would go on to address the issue in due course.

68
00:15:52,270 --> 00:16:06,440
Whether it is in subsequent judgments explaining further the use of the or otherwise ground, or in expanding the current jurisprudence regarding the grant of the leave to appeal.

69
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:23,040
Acting President, those are my personal views on the bill. I understand that my fellow members, including those in my party, would speak and perhaps differently on some of the issues involved in this bill. But those are my my views, and I.

70
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:30,040
Ask that this bill be considered carefully by members of this legislature.

71
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,390
For reasons that I have mentioned earlier, thank you, Acting President.

72
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,970
鄧家彪言。

73
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:56,350
啊！多謝代主席。今日當局提交二零一四司法執行條文啊條例草案，主要係為咗改善咧法庭運作而提出各種嘅修訂嘅措施。當中咧包括喺多個法院同埋審裁處嘅條文。身為勞工界議員嘅同埋啊，勞工界嘅代表咧。

74
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:16,360
自然係關注咧，當中咧關於勞資審裁處運作嘅相關條文，所以咧我係參加咗條例草案嘅審議工作，並喺會上面提出咗一啲嘅問題同意見。當然之前亦都喺司法嘅事務委員會裏面咧，係做咗一個過冷河嘅一個嘅誒諮詢，我亦都係提出咗一啲嘅意見。

75
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:36,650
喺度咧，係感謝咧。嗯，當局採取我哋勞工界嘅意見，尤其喺司法事務委員會嘅階段裏面咧，係將勞資審裁處原本諗住可能係修訂咧，係加入一個限制披露資料嘅條文咧，係刪除。嗯啊啊，將呢個嘅。

76
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:51,830
嗯，限制披露資料嘅條文咧，係唔再成為一個嘅草案，因為有關限制確實咧係會對工會協助工人去爭取勞工權益以及係工人嘅索償嗰度咧係有一個好大嘅影響。

77
00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:12,120
啊，代主席啊，俗語話：身不入官門。本身咧，勞資審裁處係一個啊低成本嘅法庭，希望咧係啊啊唔會阻礙工友透過法律法庭係尋求佢自己嘅補償，甚至係公義。咁但係咧，其實咧，本身咧由勞工處或者係出現。

78
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:32,130
一啲勞資糾紛去到勞工處，再去到法庭，即係勞資審裁處登記落案，再完成一個嘅審訊咧，冇半年都亦都有，即係冇一年都有半年，係一個好漫長嘅時間嚟嘅。咁所以咧，如果勞資審裁處嗰個嘅誒誒法例或者係程序上面係做得唔夠妥當，或

79
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:52,140
或者係一啲嗯客觀上面嘅條文咧，係對打工仔走入勞資審裁處係造成一啲限制，或者係不鼓勵咧。嗯，對打工仔對工會嚟講都唔係好事，所以我哋係十分之敏感。嗯，根據司法機構嘅數字咧，二零一三年勞資審裁處個案咧係有四千。

80
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:12,150
三百一十五宗，當中絕大部分咧係屬於有金錢嘅申索嘅個案。而家唔少基層打工仔喺勞處理勞資審裁處嘅法律程序，以致應訊嗰陣時咧，都會係向工會尋求協助，並且係向審裁官尋求同意，係委。

81
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:20,790
委託工會，即係工會嘅代表咧，係代表呢位新索嘅打工仔喺審裁處上面咧，係發言嘅。

82
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:41,090
而工會喺協助工友處理個案，當然會涉及到僱主或者喺呢間公司裡面嘅一啲嘅文件、一啲嘅合約、一啲可能係涉及到行政人士。舉個例，簡單到一張編間嘅表。咁有時工會要求證，究竟工友嘅申索係咪有理？

83
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:53,420
有據依足法例，甚至係合約上面已經係承諾嘅，自然會尋求呢個伸縮工友嘅其他同事嘅求證，或者係問意見。

84
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:13,710
咁所以咧，如果根據當局原先嘅建議，誒裡面其中嘅修訂就係頭先我一開始所講限制披露資料嘅規定，就係話咧，除咗勞資審裁處嘅法律程序目的以外，都不可以披露涉及文件及資料予其他人，否則將構成藐視。

85
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:33,720
違法程序而需負上法律責任。如果呢個修訂真係出現嘅話咧，我哋好憂慮咧，工會根本唔能夠協助工人，工人亦都唔敢求助工會，因為會會將呢啲噉嘅資料一畀咗工會，會唔會就變成藐視法庭咧？咁當然個官未必咁睇，但係僱主可能會。

86
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:44,010
即時向個法官投訴，誒工友將公司嘅資料畀個工會睇，噉啊，我我認為佢藐視法庭，咁都已經係令到工友係卻步。

87
00:20:44,290 --> 00:21:04,300
噉，所以我哋對於本身原有嘅呢個建議係十分之憂慮嘅。我又舉一個例子啦，譬如我哋處理一間酒樓員工欠薪嘅個案嗰陣時，可能係得一個咧工友嘅求助，但係工會對於酒樓欠薪係好敏感嘅，咁會瞭解究竟除咗呢一個正式走入法。

88
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:24,310
嘅工友，佢係咪面對欠薪，都會同時間咧希望瞭解佢哋嘅同事係咪都係面對欠薪，以推斷究竟呢一個酒樓嘅東主呢個僱主會唔會因為週轉不靈而欠薪，甚至係隨時倒閉，令到所有工友都係。

89
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:44,320
有所損失，甚至最終係所謂誒用破欠嚟找數，工廠找數。咁所以咧，對於誒如果走入法庭嘅工友，佢要披露嘅資料畀工會造成一啲限制咧，我哋認為根本係綁住工友，亦都係綁住工會嘅一個嘅做法。

90
00:21:44,390 --> 00:22:04,400
所以，對於政府喺司法事務委員會嘅階段聽咗我哋嘅意見，同意剔除或者係抽走呢一個喺勞資薪財處裏面限制披露資料嘅條文，我哋係表示十分之歡迎，亦都肯定你哋對我哋嘅尊重。我哋呼。

91
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:24,410
呼籲政府當局，如果再想提出，係一定要同勞工界做一個深入廣泛嘅諮詢，而唔係咧就咁用一個書面嘅啊回調問勞顧會嘅委員問你哋有冇反對，都冇人知究竟發生咩事，一次會議都未發生過。

92
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,680
就話咧啊，冇反對，噉樣係唔得嘅。

93
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:41,450
誒，至於喺今次嘅集行條文裏面，亦都有一個部分係關於勞資審裁處，我哋工聯會或者工會都係有所啊顧慮嘅，就係喺保證金嘅制度。

94
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,800
啊！

95
00:22:43,510 --> 00:23:03,520
喺勞資審裁處條例第三十條，有關係涉及咧，有關條例涉及咧，命令繳存款項喺勞資審裁處或提供保證。事實上咧，有一啲嘅僱主咧就好懂得運用財技喺畀打工仔伸索嘅時候，可能係會。

96
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:23,530
將資產轉移、調動，又或者咧係濫用司法程序，一拖再拖，去拖延嗰個嘅誒聆訊或者認訊嘅過程。於是咧就有咗第三十條嘅規定，列明咧審裁處可以要求被告人係繳存足夠嘅款項，又或者係提供。

97
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:43,540
足夠嘅保證，啊，代主席，呢個事實上睇落去係合情合理嘅訴求，因為無論打控走同法院都唔想有一啲嘅誒僱主喺被控嘅期間，突然間突然之間一走了之，或者係轉移資產，令到頭嚟咧，就算作咗裁決，亦都起唔到作用，或者又係最後。

98
00:23:43,540 --> 00:24:03,550
要破欠找數啊，累及公堂噉，所以就有個噉嘅條文。但係咧，今日誒條例嘅修訂裏面咧，有啲嘅新加入咗新嘅例理誒理由，例如咧喺第三十股一條中咧，提供保證即係保證金嘅人咧，由被告人改為。

99
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:23,560
命令任何一方，即係就算話呢個申索原本係由僱員訴僱主啊，大家以為咧，通常都係誒審裁處嘅法官要求僱主提供保證金，就變為咧僱員、僱主都有可能被審裁官咧係誒即係有。

100
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:43,570
個噉嘅命令，咁所以呢個係我哋憂慮嘅。新嘅理由咧，包括咧就係頭先我所講啦，被告人將財產移嚟香港啦，及任何一方濫用勞資審裁處嘅法律程序，以及沒有遵從勞資審裁處嘅裁斷命令或者指示等具體嘅條件。對於新條文之

101
00:24:43,570 --> 00:25:03,580
要求僱員繳納保證金嘅問題或者可能性咧，我曾經喺誒審議條文嗰陣時咧，其實已經係無論口頭定係書面咧，都向當局查詢。但係當局嘅回覆就係話啦，其實過去就算有冇修例，都一直係有審。

102
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:23,590
審裁官係要求僱員繳納保證嘅，而如果繳納保證金嗰陣時有疑問咧，有關人士可以作出複核或者上訴。所以其實誒本身呢個制度係令人憂心嘅，因為審裁官係喺記錄上係的確係已經係叫打工仔咧係。

103
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:43,600
畀保證金，但係咧可能嗰啲嘅個案咧係僱主訴僱員，譬如話追一啲所謂啊突然離職嘅代通知金，咁而家呢個修訂咧就變為咧任何一方，咁即係話咧僱員可能畀啊審裁官要求啊即係啊命令畀一個保。

104
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,330
保證金嘅機會咧，就再大咗。

105
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,720
嗯。

106
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:08,010
代主席先生，我嘅擔心咧喺根據一啲嘅誒，我哋服務嘅個案咧，其實係真係有理由嘅。誒，我哋工聯會底下有個勞工服務中心，裏面呢個中心裏面有幾個同事真係協助求助工友咧，係陪佢哋上法庭啊，協助佢哋咧係處理。

107
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:28,020
一單單走咗入去司法審，誒走咗去勞資審裁處，去到誒聆訊階段，陪同佢哋，甚至係誒出席協助發言。咁呢啲同事同我哋反映咧，佢係最近呢兩三年咧，佢係睇到勞資審裁處係的確多咗嘅個案咧，係要求咧僱員。

108
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:48,110
係啊，畀保證金嘅。嗯，以一個嘅嗯例子咧，就係話咧有一個工友咧係嗯申索十幾萬嘅欠薪，以及係代通資金喺申索嘅嗯頭嘅階段咧，嗯嗰位嘅審裁官咧，竟然喺一開始認為咧呢個工。

109
00:26:48,110 --> 00:27:08,120
就可能性數不足，要求咧佢先畀八千蚊嘅保證金。咁最後點咧？其實最後呢位公油係贏咗嘅，因為咧佢啊提供嘅證據，甚至係人證啦或者物證咧，係十分之充裕。咁審裁官亦都合情合理咁作出一個公有勝訴嘅裁決。但係我可以睇到咧。

110
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:28,130
原來唔係公有被告誒。原來而家審裁官已經有個咁大嘅任意性啊，中意邊個要畀就畀噉。所以雖然睇落去呢個條文咧係明確咗一啲嘢，但係其實我哋前線服務嘅經驗話畀佢聽咧，審裁官嘅任意性好大。咁所以咧誒。

111
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:48,140
誒，對於呢一次嘅修訂咧，我哋抱住一個係誒觀望嘅態度。咩意思咧？就係話，其實現實上，審裁官已經有好大嘅權力去處理呢個保證金嘅命令。誒，我哋覺得或者睇到條文係清晰化咗，或者合理化咗一啲大家都公認係誒，即係合理嘅理。

112
00:27:48,140 --> 00:28:08,150
據舉個例，拖延法律程序啊，或者可能係轉移資產，令到我哋有信心啊。呢個條文係的確係比較有利打工仔，但喺實踐起上嚟又的確咧有好多令我哋憂心嘅地方。但係我哋本住權衡整個誒嘅即係司法執行條文係一個一男一修例，亦都本住劇。

113
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:28,160
本身現在已經有保證金嘅呢種做法咧，我哋對呢個嘅法案都係會予以支持，但係喺度敦促當局，第一就係要建立一個啊資料庫，係能夠話畀我哋聽究竟喺勞資審裁處裡面過去以及嚟緊命令保證。

114
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:48,170
金嘅情況有幾多係僱主，有幾多係僱員，個金額如何命令咗之後，究竟係邊一方勝訴？我哋好希望你能夠建立呢個資料庫，話畀我哋嘅打工仔同埋工會知道咧。政府所做嘅修例繼續會係令到勞資審裁處係能夠。

115
00:28:48,170 --> 00:29:08,180
顧及到我頭先一開始所講係一個低成本，令到打工仔有信心走入法庭去解決佢僱傭關係所衍生嘅嘅嘅糾紛問題。嗯，亦都喺度呼籲同埋邀請當局，如果呢個法例最終獲得通過，希望你就住保證金嘅呢個制度。

116
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:18,370
過去嘅經驗嚟緊，你嘅諗法係實實在在噉樣同唔同嘅勞工團體係有一個深入嘅溝通，畀到我哋一個保證。

117
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:30,960
誒，我當然亦都係盼望司長可以喺一間嘅回應裏面係可以回應到我呢啲嘅憂慮。代主席先生本人支持條例草案恢復二讀以及三讀，僅此陳辭。廖長江議員。

118
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,560
主席，誒本人係贊成廢除香港終審法院條例第二十二條一A。

119
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:53,140
關於將所涉及誒嘅款額或者價值達一百萬元或以上提出嘅民事訴訟上訴咧，視為一項當然決定而受理。

120
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:08,470
經過改革咧，會使到所有中審法院嘅民事訴訟案上訴咧，係會均要得到上訴法庭或者中審法院酌情給予許可嘅情況之下咧，先至可以提出。

121
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:16,260
主席喺一九九七年香港回歸之後，根據香港基本法第八條。

122
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:24,230
香港嘅原有法律，即係基本法、衡平法條例、附屬法例同埋習慣法。

123
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,910
除咗同基本法相抵觸。

124
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,650
或者經過香港特區立法機關作出修改嘅之外咧，係予以保留。

125
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,310
所以香港係繼承。

126
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:44,000
咗同埋延續咗英國樞密院司法委員會嘅上訴制度中嘅當然決定。

127
00:30:45,160 --> 00:31:05,170
但係隨住時代嘅變遷，幾近每一個同香港有緊密聯繫嘅普通法國家咧，包括英國、澳洲、新西蘭，同埋大部分經加拿大最高法院處理嘅案件咧，都係廢除咗當然權。

128
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,690
嘅。

129
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:15,380
目前香港係仍然保持民事訴訟上訴嘅當然權利，係未能跟進主要普通法地區嘅發展。

130
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,270
係現代主流普通法司法司法系統嘅二類。

131
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:30,150
然而廢除當然權利並唔僅僅係要同其他普通法係嘅國家看齊。

132
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,130
而係出於法理上嘅需要。

133
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,300
現存嘅制度。

134
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,950
將一個上訴權利同埋一個主觀嘅金錢限額。

135
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:49,240
即係港幣一百萬元掛鈎，實際上係使到超於金錢限額嘅上訴人。

136
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,810
比其他較小額嘅上訴人咧，係擁有更多嘅權利。

137
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:05,380
上述案件嘅衡量標準應該係案件本身嘅理據，而非係既定嘅金錢限額。

138
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:21,070
喺當然權利之下，冇上訴價值嘅案件，能夠直接喺中心法院受理；而循此路徑提交中心法院嘅上訴案件咧，好多可能都係缺乏上訴理據。

139
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,820
噉樣做係嚴重妨礙咗香港法律上訴系統嘅效率。

140
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,960
不僅導致案件延期，因而否定司法正義。

141
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,500
法院無法及時庭審。

142
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,050
其他更具充分理據嘅上訴案件。

143
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,450
特別係公法領域嘅案件。

144
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,140
呢啲係對香港司法系統嘅濫用，係對公共資源。

145
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,340
嘅嚴重，喺公共資源方面嘅嚴重浪費。

146
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,570
主席值得注意嘅係咧，提高金錢限額咧，並唔係一項選擇。

147
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,620
金錢限額嘅適當標準係難作定奪嘅。

148
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:14,120
況且提高金錢限額喺上實際上咧，係咪對係咪能夠顯著減少無意義嘅上述案件咧，係非常值得懷疑。

149
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,450
反對金額。

150
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:25,390
限額嘅存在嘅根本原因咧，係如上所述，係上述權利同埋金錢限額嘅連結。

151
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,950
提高金錢限額，唔能夠根治上述權利同埋金錢限額嘅不合理連結問題。

152
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,630
此外，廢除。

153
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:47,990
民事案件上訴中嘅當然權利咧，係有助有效咁整合香港司法系統民事、刑事嘅上訴機制。

154
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:59,800
喺刑事上訴系統下咧，上訴權利係完全取決於上訴案件本身嘅理據，係同任何金錢限額係無關。

155
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:08,280
所以主席，我係贊成廢除香港終審法院條例第二十二條一A下嘅當然權利。

156
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:20,520
呢個唔僅係出於法理上嘅考量，而且係更符合公眾利益，同埋有助香港司法系統同埋法治嘅健康發展。近似陳詞。

157
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,660
有冇其他議員想發言？

158
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:33,080
如果冇，現在請政務司司長發言答辯。喺政務司司長答辯之後，辯論即告結束。政務司司長。

159
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:53,910
主席，首先我要感衷心感謝二零一四年司法雜項條文條例草案委員會（簡稱法案委員會）主席郭榮亨議員及各位委員喺審議二零一四年司法雜項條文條例草案（簡稱條例草案）時所付出嘅努力。

160
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,610
令條例草案嘅審議工作得以順利完成。

161
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,620
法案委員會舉行咗四次會議，對條例草案嘅條文作出詳細及深入嘅討論。

162
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:13,370
我喺呢度感謝法案委員會嘅工作，亦感謝持份團體同埋人士向法案委員會表達對條例草案嘅意見。

163
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:33,890
政府提出條例草案嘅目的係落實司法機構就法庭運作所作出嘅改善建議，涉及以下範疇：第一，喺民事重案或者事項中向中審法院上訴；第二，喺刑事法律程序中，藉電視直播聯係錄。

164
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:53,900
取證據嘅安排。第三區域法院喺刑事法律程序中宣告裁決理由嘅方法，各嘅方式。第四符合上任裁判官委任資格所需經驗嘅計算。第五勞資審裁處嘅運作，以及第六各個法院審裁處對訴訟。

165
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,120
用人儲存金嘅管理。

166
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:16,750
喺條例草案審議期間，法案委員會特別關注司法機構有關取消民事事項中以當然權利提出上訴制度嘅建議。事實上，剛才郭榮亨議員以作為法案委員會嘅主席同埋個人嘅發言，以及廖長。

167
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:36,760
楊江議員誒嘅發言咧，都係針對呢個嘅建議，可見咧呢個議題咧係相當重要嘅。我特別聽高興咧，係聽到郭榮亨議員雖然誒誒佢反映咗法案委員會裏邊有唔同嘅意見，甚至佢所屬嘅政黨咧，或許對於呢個。

168
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:47,850
建議咧都有所保留，但係佢嘅本人咧係同意政府今次提出嘅建議。佢提出嘅理由咧，同司法機構嘅考慮咧，都大致係啊相同㗎。

169
00:36:48,130 --> 00:37:08,140
我係想重新咧提出建議嘅原因係呢個制度喺原則上並不妥當，將上訴嘅權利同隨意定下嘅金錢限額掛鈎嘅後果係不論件案件嘅理據是否充分，只要訴訟人所提出嘅上訴爭議嘅事項所涉及嘅訴訟款額。

170
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:28,150
或者價值達一百萬元或以上，則中審法院需提需是提出該上訴為一項當然權利而受理該上訴。呢個實質上令到有關訴訟人所得嘅權利係比申索額較少嘅訴訟人為多。對於訴訟人尋求司法公正而言，

171
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:48,160
呢個係唔平等嘅。中審法院曾經喺多宗案件中嚴詞批評，當然權利呢個制度，因為呢個制度會導致法庭聆訊有合理理據嘅案件時咧係有所言誤，更甚者會導致不公平。亦都係正如好似郭榮亨議員同埋廖長。

172
00:37:48,160 --> 00:38:04,880
楊江議員提出，喺其他同香港製度相近嘅普通法司法司法管轄區，呢個制度咧早已被廢除。喺該等司法管轄區中，案件必須先取得許可，然後先就可以向最高級別嘅法院提出上訴。

173
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:26,100
中審法院係香港嘅最終上訴法院，而非與上訴法庭以相同基礎運作嘅第二上訴法庭。喺修訂法例後，只有在上訴所涉及嘅問題具有重大廣泛嘅，或者關乎公眾嘅重要性，或者因其他理由，以致應交由中審法院。

174
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:46,110
裁決時，該等上訴才會由中審法院審理。司法機構曾經向法案委員會提供資料，解釋中審法院及上訴庭也曾順水基於或因其他理由，或者連同其他理由給予上訴許可。因此，呢一行建議咧，並不會令上。

175
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,370
上訴人嘅權利受到任何實質嘅損害。

176
00:38:49,850 --> 00:39:05,430
司法機構認為不宜喺法例列出批准或者拒絕根據或因其他理由呢個部分提出嘅上訴許可申請嘅考慮因素，因為呢個噉樣做咧係會減少中審法院處理呢啲申請嘅靈活性。

177
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:26,030
法案委員會亦都關注到喺刑事法律程序中，藉住電視直播聯繫錄取證據所使用嘅視聽設施嘅安全性。司法機構向法案委員會表示，會確保有關視聽設施均配配備安全保護功能，亦都會就有關科技設備嘅使用。

178
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:35,910
諮詢刑事法庭使用者委員會，司法機構亦都建議喺法例中定明有關設施需經終審法院首席法官批准。

179
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:56,990
有關區域法院喺刑事法律程序中宣告裁決理由嘅方式，司法機構接納咗法案委員會嘅建嘅提議，喺法例中定明應透過互聯網向公眾提供直接以書面形式發下嘅裁決理由嘅文本，以及定明轉為文字記錄嘅裁決理。

180
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:03,120
理由嘅發佈方式應與直接以書面形式發下嘅裁決理由嘅發佈方式相若。

181
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:23,830
代主席，剛才鄧家彪議員關注條例草案有關勞資審裁處條例嘅修訂，特別係保證金呢個問題。根據現時嘅勞資審裁處條例，勞資審裁處有權喺某一啲情況下命令訴訟人提供保證金。為咗加大審裁處嘅案件管理能力。

182
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:43,840
條例草案其中一項修訂係修改勞資審裁處條例，賦予審裁處一般嘅權力，讓其隨時可以在任何一方申請或者複核裁斷或命令嘅程序中，如認為公正同埋合宜，便可命令另一方為裁斷或者命令嘅款項提。

183
00:40:43,840 --> 00:41:00,010
公保證金可能作出如此命令嘅情況，包括有關一方嘅所涉資產有被耗散嘅風險，該方言情罪，或者該方喺沒有合理辯解嘅情況下不遵從審裁處嘅指示等。

184
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:21,030
有關嘅建議修訂適用於申索人或者被告人，而勞方同埋資方均可能係申索人或者係被告人。例如，資方可以向僱員提出申索，以追討代通知金或因違反僱用合約而需支付嘅損害賠償。此外，作為申索人嘅

185
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,720
嘅牢方，亦都可能遭到作為被告人嘅資方咧提出反申索。

186
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:46,010
鄧議員擔心修訂對勞方不公平，我想指出，資方同埋勞方都可以係案件嘅申索人同埋被告人。我哋認為，不宜咧喺法例上對勞方同埋資方作出不一致嘅處理方法，而應該盡量提供彈性，讓審裁處可以按案件嘅個別。

187
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,550
情況作出最合當嘅安排。

188
00:41:48,830 --> 00:42:02,370
審裁處喺決定是否作出提供保證金嘅命令時，有關一方是否有足夠嘅財力繳付所需款項，係其考慮嘅因素之一。噉樣嘅安排咧，亦都係得到勞工顧問委員會嘅支持。

189
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:22,900
鄧議員發言時表示，針對呢個修訂咧，佢會採取觀望嘅態度，但係希望當局咧，政府當局咧係承諾喺條文通過後，需要就保證個案作出統計，或者佢所講嘅建立呢個資料庫，同時咧亦都係希望政府當局認真考慮設立。

190
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,730
復檢機制處理保證嘅問題。

191
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:37,050
由於有關個案咧係屬於司法機構嘅工作範圍之內，我會將鄧議員有關建立資料庫嘅建議咧，係轉達畀司法機構嚟到考慮。

192
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:57,710
但至於設立復檢機制呢個建議咧，司法機構曾經向法案委員會表示，正如其他勞資審裁處嘅命令一樣，若勞資審裁處作出要求某一方提供保證嘅命令，該一方咧可以提出複核及或上訴。司法機構認為咧係冇需要令。

193
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:04,340
另行作出一個仲裁嘅安排，或者如鄧議員所建議咧，設立一個復檢嘅機制。

194
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:24,780
代主席，因應法案委員會嘅意見，政府對條例草案提出數項修正案，目的係回應委員嘅建議，以及作出文字修訂。有關修正案均已呈交法案委員會考慮及討論，而我會喺全體委員會審議階段動議有關修正案。代主席，條例草案。

195
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:44,790
提出嘅修訂對於改善法庭有多多方面嘅運作非常重要，我懇請議員支持條例草案及我稍後動議嘅各項修正案。多謝代主席。我現在向各位提出嘅代決議題係《2014年司法雜項條文條例草案》予以移讀，現在付諸表決。

196
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,940
贊成嘅請舉手。

197
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,720
反對嘅請舉手。

198
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:59,310
我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。二零一四年司法雜項條文條例草案。

199
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,090
全體委員會審議階段，本會現在成為全體委員會。
