OK。

15
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,470
我知道。

16
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,110
我記得喎，我記得，不過個view是nothing controversial。

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,460
畀佢即係多食下。

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,170
綜藝節目，我冇睇太多嘢。

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,070
just exam right.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,500
佢啲exemption有冇得apply the exemption？

21
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,380
都可以。

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,270
幾時會可以？

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,940
ok。

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,950
Are they coming?

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,100
yes.

26
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,430
得閒。

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,560
可唔可以用英文啊？可唔可以用英文啊？

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,440
係。

29
00:02:43,310 --> 00:03:03,320
Okay, well welcome everyone from the Law Society. I've been informed that there is no going to be no representatives from the Secretary for Justice today, but we'll soldier on nevertheless. We only have one hour today, so first of all, I'm going to invite representative of the Law Society.

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,210
To explain their position on this issue, and then we'll open the floor to the members. Thank you.

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,680
多謝主席。

32
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,700
好，my name's Dennis Brock. I chair the Foreign Lawyers Committee of the Law Society.

33
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:31,830
Before you, there are these amendments which are focused on. The only substantial amendment to our rules is to bring in a new

34
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,690
And yet, unnumbered head six, which would be the new constitutional exam.

35
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:45,740
As you know, any foreign lawyer wanted to be admitted in Hong Kong has to go through the overseas lawyer qualification exam, of which there are presently five heads.

36
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,010
There will be an additional head on our constitution.

37
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,230
There are then three.

38
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:06,030
或四項，的，釐清，，effectively codifying or memorialising what is already policy in relation to considering applications to sit the exam.

39
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,470
The amendments were passed by Ledgeco.

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,390
and the negative vetting period expired on the 28th of May this year.

41
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:23,510
The only residual aspect is the commencement date, which we have proposed as 2nd of January, 2015.

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,640
Thank you, Ms. Brock.

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,890
Any other representative for law society would like to contribute?

44
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,980
If no, then I'm gonna open up the.

45
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,480
Panel to the members of this committee，啊，議員有冇咩提問？

46
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:58,360
係。你而家做好又幾時會做好嗰個syllabus啊？嗰個成個package係嘛？即係嗰個誒誒時間表係嘛？啊嚇。

47
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,510
有清或者。

48
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,720
講講嗰個時間表嘅問題。

49
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,550
係。

50
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,110
既然佢講廣東話，不如我講啦。其實咧，誒，英文都得嘅，冇問題。

51
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,250
啊，OK。

52
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,590
In fact, the the only addition to the

53
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:22,610
exam is the paper on Hong Kong constitutional law, and all the other examination we have been holding it for.

54
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:37,510
How many years? 1995. Since 1995, so it's a 20 years practice. So there's only the only addition is a one additional paper, and I understand from the secretary of the law society.

55
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,130
that they have.

56
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,720
In that line, up the panel for that.

57
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,040
paper。

58
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,580
And invitation was sent out.

59
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,610
所以， we are pretty sure that the

60
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,970
will be ready for the commencement in the coming January.

61
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,120
Thank you.

62
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,920
If if there are no other questions, yes, Mr. James Towe.

63
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,420
主席，係，冇意思，因為因為我誒記得咧嗰陣時內會咧，我唔係我提出成立嘅。

64
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,110
就係阿湯家華議員咧，就我見佢舉手提出成立嘅。

65
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:32,400
噉就第一，我見佢就冇參加呢個委員會咧。我你有冇知唔知道佢有冇咩嘢係誒問？有佢同我講過，我會代佢提出問題。噉你不如你你問啦，因為因為我咧就即係驚唔夠人咧，就幫手組成個委員會，等佢可以問嘅。係噉，如果你如果係我係有問題嘅，噉我可以聽聽你啲問題噉樣啊噉樣。好，嗯，in fact the

66
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
嗯。

67
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:53,650
The questions that I have, since no other members have questions, is regarding the policy of overseas lawyers of the Law Society. The policy of the Law Society in granting exemptions in the past regarding papers, and also this new paper that which will be introduced.

68
00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:00,730
What is the policy regarding possible exemptions, if any, if an applicant wishes to apply in the future?

69
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:12,800
And who will set the syllabus? And I understand the panel of examiners will. Is there? Is it possible to give us some sort of

70
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:33,340
indication or guidance on what sort of questions or what sort of topics will be examined under this this heading. So, couple questions: exemptions, policy on overseas lawyers generally, and also actual examination topics under this heading.

71
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,200
That's.

72
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,710
That's for me, I guess.

73
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,350
The gateway to being allowed to take the exam is.

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,610
兩年。如果如果申請人有五年經驗，然後他們有資格申請豁免。

75
00:07:49,890 --> 00:08:05,030
Generally, if someone has at least at present, if they have five years, they are automatically exempted from Head Two, which is litigation. Effectively, Head One is conveyancing, and it is in in view of the fact that Hong Kong has.

76
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:25,540
A globally unique conveyancing system, based upon a riding of Yorkshire system in 1924. There is no possibility or prospect of anyone obtaining an exemption from conveyancing. So that's always sat. Head three is company commercial, which my friend John Chan looks after and makes sure.

77
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:45,550
The candidates have adequate company commercial experience. It used to be the case that if you're a commercial litigator, that was probably good enough. We're somewhat more stringent now in wanting to see a proper level of commercial law awareness. Head for is accounts and ethics. Essentially, if you've taken a course and been passed in something.

78
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:57,160
which looks like our sister accounts rules, then we're comfortable. So put it bluntly, if you come from England or Australia or New Zealand or Canada and have passed the accounts course, that's fine.

79
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:09,980
It's a combined paper with ethics, so the ethical standards are broadly similar. Some jurisdictions have bifurcated and don't have an accounts module, and that's been causing us some internal.

80
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,810
discussion.

81
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:26,800
And I think we're moving to a point where, unless your jurisdiction has an accounts module, you'll be required to take head four. The reason being is that the handling of client funds is very important, and an awareness of our sister's accounts rules is very important.

82
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,120
所以，那係廣義上嘅架構，係點樣去處理豁免嘅問題。

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:39,610
It's fair to say that we are, how one put it, John, inclusive. Yeah, if I may add something to what Dennis said.

84
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,200
what then is said is。

85
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,520
About epicentrum, a common law jurisdiction.

86
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,450
所以，那係五 years，那。

87
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:58,670
previous experience in the practice of law，such an applicant would be entitled for exemptions，but for lawyers from non-common law jurisdictions。

88
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,750
normally，the，we，we，don't，grant，exemption。

89
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,310
except。

90
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,530
嗯，The。

91
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,690
啲papers on on the principal common law.

92
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:18,830
which is an oral examination, if an applicant from law and common law jurisdiction, and he has set or passed a

93
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:33,680
Well，taking courses in common law，like masters in common law in the local university，then we will grant exemption to those non-common law jurisdiction lawyers。Otherwise。

94
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,500
no exemptions granted to any non-common-law jurisdiction lawyers.

95
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:49,980
And for sitting exam, these lawyer from non-criminal law jurisdiction, we require them to have five years' previous experience instead of two for the for the criminal law jurisdiction lawyers.

96
00:10:50,680 --> 00:11:01,730
And that period of exemption or period of experience must be in the previous ten years. So if someone hasn't been practising, if they've been farming for the past ten years, then they are.

97
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,400
shut out.

98
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:23,820
所以， for someone who is from a non-common law jurisdiction but has taken something like the master of common law program at say the Hong Kong U, he or she would be regarded as a common law lawyer who would be, or still a non-common law lawyer, but who would be qualified for exemption after five years. No, if they if they apply

99
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:34,130
作為一名民事律師，但他們碰巧有修讀過學術課程，則我們會考慮該課程的內容，如果它滿足。

100
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:44,890
us that it matches the the requirements, the six core topics of a common law subject of a common law exam, then we'll exempt them from the vivre, which is head five.

101
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,810
One of these amendments is a sort of tidying up amendment, which is if.

102
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,890
We had a slight anomaly in years gone by, which is someone came from say.

103
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:10,810
typically the PRC qualified in the PRC and then went to New York and qualified in New York. We took a first a first touch route, which meant your PRC you have to be a civil lawyer. Now there are many PRC lawyers who take the bar and.

104
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:22,320
China go to New York, spend 20 years in New York, and then come to Hong Kong, and that was ludicrous. So we've now taken the view, as a matter of policy, and now as a matter of rule change, that they can elect.

105
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,350
所以，那P.R.C.律師或法國律師或。

106
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:36,020
Dutch lawyer, if they've got a common law qualification, they can then say that's my point of entry, and then they can seek exemptions under their common law qualification.

107
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,420
But what I think, John, we we don't give exemptions for academic.

108
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,440
common law success.

109
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,530
我see。

110
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,950
唔同，changes。

111
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,460
Apart from the additional paper of the constitutional law, the change this time is also that we give the applicant the choice to choose.

112
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Their jurisdiction. If they they they are admitted in different jurisdictions.

113
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,090
所以。

114
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,700
In cases like if they're middle inPLC and then

115
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,170
They went to England or went to the U.S. and get a common law jurisdiction qualification, then they can choose.

116
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,890
Obviously, the

117
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:33,180
The concern of the Hong Kong legal profession, I like to say and put this on record, is that although we run a so-called open jurisdiction that we welcome and encourage the best lawyers from around the world to come and work here in Hong Kong, we also want to ensure that there are sufficient checks and

118
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:53,190
balances and also sufficient qualification criterias that will be applied to assess whether a person is qualified to be a Hong Kong lawyer or indeed qualified for any exemptions. So for this head, what is your your view on going forward? How about for this specific head?

119
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,350
Well, is there any established sort of guidance or policy that you guys are thinking about?

120
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,430
Well, obviously it's new and it's a paper that, in fact, I think was a creation of mine and.

121
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,390
Martin Rogers some ten years ago.

122
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,440
因為我們認為重要。

123
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,390
That.

124
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,100
律師 had a grasp of our constitution.

125
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,510
誒。

126
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:33,600
It hasn't been set yet, but it's obviously going to focus on the basic law, and one assumes it'll focus on the the cases we've had in the last 17 years where the courts have sought to interpret the basic law.

127
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,250
啊，梁議員，你啱啱入咗嚟，你會唔會有咩問題啊？誒，我要跟一跟先，唔好意思。好啊。嚇，你哋傾緊咩啊？

128
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,450
阿石生，阿石議員。Yes, I'm glad that someone's back here now. I don't have to keep you company.

129
00:14:50,370 --> 00:15:10,380
My question actually is quite simple. Understand that the Law Society is consulting on a examination for local lawyers. That people who who who call who actually graduated without attending the PCL. I think that was.

130
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:18,910
was being discussed in this chamber last year. Now, there are a lot of frustrated law graduates.

131
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:25,010
who failed to gain admission to PCIL by the three institutions.

132
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:34,360
and those graduates then if they go overseas and get gain admission, having got their L.B. or J.D. whatever it is.

133
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:42,070
having been qualified for for in overseas, can they come back and seek

134
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,470
嗯，嗯，this。

135
00:15:45,770 --> 00:16:01,330
as what you call this abstention from this four heads? Because since they have studied a lot in Hong Kong and they well versed with the constitution, do they still need that five years requirement?

136
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,560
the fact they're the fact they've studied law in Hong Kong.

137
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:19,490
makes them eligible to be admitted in, say, England or Australia, but they apply for the exemption from the OLQE as being either an English or Australian lawyer, where they took their first degree is not.

138
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:39,780
Of our concern, we look at their their place of qualification, and then they can seek exemption if they've gone through the gateways. But the but the the purpose of setting for the heads for constitutional law, convening and so they would have studied this in their undergraduate years.

139
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,830
所以， why did they need to sit for examination again?

140
00:16:46,370 --> 00:17:06,380
without I mean without the five years because a lot of people we do need I like the openness of this profession and different from barristers there is a close shop but you you are actually opening the doors to attract more talents to Hong Kong which is a financial commercial centre of the world so we need a lot of lawyers and.

141
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:26,390
the the very nature of the control by the Trinity University to debar people from entering into the the lawyer's field, which is rather pathetic. So so basically, this is a way out for people who have actually studied locally and passed.

142
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:46,400
the examination having qualif need because they don't want to be qualified overseas because of this arcade system of this control by the three university badly so so they gain admissions overseas and coming back to they still my question is very simple they were worth of all the heads of the different examination.

143
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:54,040
Why they need to sit for that examination if they are if they have been less than five years experience?

144
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,340
Mr. Le Broc. Mr. Lee Chan, two point to clarify your your questions.

145
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,690
I still remember when before I joined the legal profession, I was in the transport department.

146
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:16,840
所以people， they can pass the exam here， the driving test， so they they went overseas and get a license and come back to Hong Kong and change for Hong Kong driving license。

147
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,150
所以，那係某啲你你，似乎，你係講緊，但係，有，有。

148
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,740
something different. One is that we recognise the people's

149
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,140
practice and law experience。

150
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,120
not the academic qualification. So, regardless of what they have studied.

151
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,530
The basic requirements is that if there are common common law's restriction, we need them to have practice.

152
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:56,320
The law of his own jurisdiction for at least two years before he is allowed to sit examination. Yeah, right. For a common law jurisdiction, five years. But the so the second point is, you talk about convening paper.

153
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,970
as far as I understand.

154
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,380
在香港，你只可以研究佢嘅發明，你係PCRL。

155
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,410
但係，如果你完成咗PCLL，你唔你唔 need to take the the overseas lawyers examination。

156
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,350
you can you can just go straight.

157
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,840
to Chinese Chinese ship in Hong Kong.

158
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:27,170
但係，但

159
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,890
Very likely. No, no, no one gets exempted from conveyancing. Okay. Regard because there's no, as I said, I think you may have missed it.

160
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:55,440
香港系統的傳承是獨特，它基於一個系統，在英格蘭約克郡的一個選區從一九二四年開始，他們放棄了它，然後我們有八十五年的香港普通法。沒有任何人來。我同意你，我沒有，我沒有在做辯論，我是在做。

161
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:06,710
case for the many, many and frustrated graduates who are forced overseas, unless until you have that examination.

162
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:27,040
as as proposed by the law society under consultation now that they can come back and sit for that examination, that they can be qualified and then enter into the system. But we are forcing out a lot of young people out from Hong Kong into overseas for for for for admissions. And I'm I'm

163
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,770
asking you to consider it.

164
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:49,060
作為一個特殊類別， of those people who want to make Hong Kong their home, who want to work in Hong Kong as a lawyer, and being deprived because of that three university, they they took a lot of money encouraging people to study law, but not by admission of qualification by.

165
00:20:49,060 --> 00:21:09,070
By a mission of merit, a lot of local graduates were actually deprived of the chance to enter into the profession because they can't start the PCL. So I'm totally in support of law society to start a thinking now that which is under consultation on.

166
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:18,080
一 examination which I think is a very good thing for a lot of our young lawyers to be. You know, sorry, I'm just.

167
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,000
considered about this.

168
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:35,400
Specific case is very unique. We have churn out a lot of law graduates, but every year we limited the number of people into the profession. Not by the law society, but by the three universities, which is not the purpose of university.

169
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:55,770
我我完全同意，就是是，整個事情必須在律師公會的控制之下。對於律師，但係 somehow 這個事情係唔係噉樣。所以如果你可以考慮回顧，唔係針對呢個特別的條例，如果可以為呢個特殊羣體做啲嘢，幫助佢哋回歸香港。

170
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:05,070
那係一個情況，我認為係好重要。唔係關係呢個，但係趁呢個機會，唔係完全唔關係，係一個公平嘅問題。我認為，Mr. Brok。

171
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,860
Well, thank you for your comments. Good to know we've got another vote in favour of changing the system.

172
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,970
As you rightly point out, it's beyond the remit of.

173
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:31,350
the the foreign lawyers committee, although the relationship is that if if there were to be law society files introduced in Hong Kong, that would possibly eradicate the need for the overseas lawyers qualification exam because it would be a single point of entry. Thank you.

174
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,250
兩億。

175
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:54,310
嗯，Thank you, Chairman. In fact, I first of all I have to declare interest. I I I have been teaching at City University Law School, but I do not teach PCLL. So a long time back, I have suggested the legal community to explore the

176
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:14,320
possibility to have a common examination based on the fact that we truly have a number of good candidates who might not be able to go into PCCL. That is a fact. Okay, so for that, we I personally, and I know some other academics are are open. In fact, worthwhile to explore.

177
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:34,430
However, concerning whether examinations and this kind of additional conversion courses requirement is concerned, I truly think some of the courses are very unique for Hong Kong. I taught different kind of students from Europe, from other common laws, and also civil law.

178
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:51,960
system， so basic law， land law， are very different， and then concerning， actually you list some other more general course from from a point of view is contract law， tort， criminal etc.， we also have our own precedents now。

179
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:08,390
Because after handover, only Hong Kong precedents are binding to Hong Kong and other common law jurisdictions are persuasive. So I have a question to ask is concerning 5D.

180
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,660
5D，因為它有數據在。

181
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,990
啊！

182
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:22,950
That the period of privilege, privilege cannot be recognised as post-ambition experience. Do you mean that, in fact?

183
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:33,380
to be barrister overseas， you know， in many jurisdictions like Singapore， New Zealand， actually， they there is fusion。

184
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:46,510
The lawyers are both advocate and solicitor, right? So, how I I I would like to know. Maybe you can clarify. Does it mean that?

185
00:24:47,400 --> 00:25:01,050
barrister pupilage is excluded as the eligibility eligibility criteria, or or just purely only the pupilage pupilage period. How about article collection?

186
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:22,410
I think you're talking about the description of how we define practice experience in the practice of law. So we've been counting article clerkship, traineeship, and legal practice course in lieu of training. So the two years they counted, they counted.

187
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:28,340
This two years article counted, but why not pupilage? Why? Because it's different. It's a different branch.

188
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:48,630
Because we are talking about practice experience in the practice of law for the purpose of overseas lawyers' qualification examination, which is targeted at solicitors. Okay, Chairman, may I further? Yes, please. In many jurisdictions, solicitors and barristers they now actually they have fusion. I'm I'm just concerned like.

189
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,240
Like, why you just exclude?

190
00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:12,600
barrister or or pupillage, if they would like to take the same courses. In fact, I I graduated from Hong, I took PCCL in Hong Kong, so actually it's just a matter of choice after we finish PCCL to choose whether we will take pupillage or article clerkship. In some other jurisdictions, I know.

191
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,180
Actually， they don't have such distinction nowadays. So

192
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,510
Are you only referring to to to UK or what?

193
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:35,170
Yeah, if for jurisdictions that have fused profession, then there is no distinction, so we'll count the period of training. So if they have no distinction, then they will count that year of training.

194
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,500
That's right. Yes. Okay. So which jurisdiction is in your mind? UK? UK. Yes.

195
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:52,130
Right, many other common law jurisdictions are already no distinction between barrister and solicitor. Yes, UK is one.

196
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,720
any more.

197
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,830
因為你寫得 so explicitly。

198
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:10,610
Can't think of any. Can't think of any. Yeah, okay. But even you came. Singapore already come fusion. You you can be an advocate and a solicitor together.

199
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,580
所以。

200
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,820
also， in fact。

201
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:32,140
for this requirement of the duration of this, like for example, article clerkship. So you say common law jurisdiction, you only require two years. Non common law jurisdiction, which cover China and so for law countries.

202
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,180
then they need to have five years practising experience.

203
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:45,350
Does it include their? They might also have one or two year like training. Would it be counted also?

204
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,910
我哋max。

205
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,280
year，one year training only. Article clerkship also only count one year. I see.

206
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:09,690
Yes. Yes. I I thought it's only for the unless the one year or two years they are required for the admission into the foreign jurisdiction.

207
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:18,240
then we will count them. So, pupilage, for instance, if they are required as part of the admission requirement in that foreign jurisdiction.

208
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,140
要成為律師，然後我們會處理。我們會考慮。

209
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:31,900
但係，如果係一種喺，喺加上，到入境要求喺，喺

210
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,990
For instance, just give you example.

211
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,670
In U.S.

212
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:45,190
law school graduates after admission, they would typically get a clerkship, right, with the Supreme Court, with whatever court.

213
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,710
那會 not be counted.

214
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:54,400
In here, because that's not part of the practice, unless we construe it as good enough practice of law.

215
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,530
That's exactly what post admission, yes. Yes, Chairman.

216
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,130
no we.

217
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:21,060
嗱，

218
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:37,300
So will that will those people be counted? It's like they take the same lawyer's examination. Then later on they they will enter the judiciary. Will those years of experience be counted? Has it been as

219
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:57,590
Seriously considered the specific. Well, if if it's pre-admission, as Dennis reminded me, if a pre-admission, for instance, in New York, is not counted because it's not part of the admission requirement. Okay. But if it's post-admission in New York, we would consider it whether if it.

220
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:13,710
It is good enough practice of law as we as defined here, so its practice of law then will count it. But if it's not, then it's not counted. So may I clarify from you? If a graduate, a law graduate from UK.

221
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,880
They would like to go into the pupillage and then become a barrister.

222
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,820
如果他們 want to,

223
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,570
come back and choose this channel to become solicitor again.

224
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,420
Then， both privilege and their practice as a barrister will not be counted.

225
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,690
Am I correct?

226
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:58,350
No, the practice of barrister will be counted. Will be counted, so they can actually, it may be a switch miracle for those young barrister to come back to be soliciting in Hong Kong if they have proven experience. They have the sit exams.

227
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,440
Yeah, of course, you have to sit exam.

228
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,330
但係，佢哋 still need to take all those courses， right？

229
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,000
except the common law if they arrest them，嚇？Yes，sorry，I can't hear you。

230
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,690
except the paper and common law， the waiver， yeah。

231
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:27,150
Except the paper on common law, they are exempted. You mean, yeah? If the okay, the hypothetical English barrister, barrister from England and Wales, with five years experience.

232
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,560
會畀啊！

233
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,270
First of all, because he comes from England and Wales, he's exempted from.

234
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:41,150
The common law viva, so he then has at the moment four, and the next year we five exams, and if he goes through the various gateways of

235
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,400
五 years in the practice of law, he will be eligible at present to be exempt from procedure.

236
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:57,470
Typically, barristers don't get exempted from accounts and ethics because they don't do assisted accounts rules in England. Obviously, they have to do conveyancing. Commercial is

237
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,880
whether they can demonstrate adequate knowledge of commercial law.

238
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:09,210
We don't treat them any differently. The fact they come from the barristers' branch or the solicitors' branch in England, or wherever, is irrelevant. It's what

239
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,490
It's what they've been practising.

240
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:19,710
In their home jurisdiction, and indeed what they've been practising here. If they come here and register as a registered foreign lawyer, we give them credit.

241
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:40,150
哦，sorry， Chairman， I got some confusion. You just mentioned again five years practising experience, but from what we are aware of, we are mentioning graduate and also relevant common law experiences. Only two years, so exemptions is five. Exemptions is five. Gateway is two.

242
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,600
Okay. So embarrassed to coming from England.

243
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:59,240
has got to wait two years because in order to catch up with a solicitor from England who's done two years articles or what are they training contract, so the two kids who go to law school the same day in England, they can come to Hong Kong on broadly the same day and sit the exam.

244
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,680
嗯。

245
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:16,930
Okay. Now, if that child, if that person happens to be a Hong Kong graduate and went to England and spent ten years at Freshfields in London, then he can come back and get exempted and sit the OLQE and requalify in Hong Kong. We don't treat them any differently.

246
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,370
他可以 get the exemption of courses.

247
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:38,340
We, I mean, I think in a broad statement, we expect the foreign jurisdictions when they admit people in those common law jurisdictions to have satisfied themselves as to the academic component of the admission. We don't delve into what they studied at university.

248
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,510
係咪清？

249
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,910
多謝你。

250
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:53,660
And so all these required causes are taken care by the law society.

251
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,350
second。

252
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:11,560
they they all these additional all these required courses are taken care by the law society right so there are professional providers yeah I I read that so there will be a bundle of materials and they will have syllabus etc.

253
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:23,280
We have a set syllabus. It's we provide the syllabus. We don't provide courses, so we have commercial providers in the market to do that.

254
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,070
maybe maybe there is some confusion here I think.

255
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,550
啊！

256
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:50,840
We are dealing with foreign lawyers only, those lawyers who have been admitted overseas, not in Hong Kong. Okay, Hong Kongers can go through PCCL and they can automatically get into the legal profession. But then we are talking about these foreign lawyers who studied overseas and become a lawyers overseas.

257
00:34:50,840 --> 00:35:04,460
They come to Hong Kong, they want to become Hongkongers. So we don't really offer them courses. We we decide whether they should sit all five exams, or they can sit just one. That's what we do. That's what the committee does.

258
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,830
and then in order to determine whether that person should.

259
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:29,120
Take five or take two, we look at their practice. If they had five years of practice of law, and that's very qualitative, in addition to quantitative, and then we use the syllabus to judge to certain extent whether that person has been exposed to these different areas of law.

260
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:37,600
as would a Hong Kong solicitor be required to be exposed to, over in the law school or in the PCLL?

261
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,500
或During the two years of training, so actually they can do self-studies.

262
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,070
just take the examination.

263
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:55,090
They can be taken online. They can study overseas if they wish. They don't need to be here to do it. They take the exam here, but they can study overseas.

264
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:17,870
In a way, we are trying to create a kind of a fair to certain extent, right? It's a fairness for for us treating foreign since we are inviting foreign lawyers to come to practice Hong Kong law, so we want to be kind to them and we want to set a standard. So that's basically the standard that's been.

265
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:28,010
set over the past many many years, unless you want to set a higher bar, that would be a different issue, right? Somebody another gentleman mentioned earlier.

266
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,860
I come from New York. I pass New York bar. I'm from China actually, but I pass New York bar.

267
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:54,240
The New York is different. Anybody has to take an exam, okay, 26 subjects at a time. So you have to go through the barbary or whatever review courses and then you take it. But then you must have one common law education, like one year. So you take a LLM, one year, then you are qualified. If you just fresh from China without

268
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:13,650
Without any common law education and you want to sit that exam, no. But if you come from Hong Kong, yes, you can. From Hong Kong, you a law school and you want to sit the New York exam, yes, you can because it's a common law jurisdiction. So for New York, is only that one year education that counts.

269
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:21,690
otherwise，everybody goes through the the examination，but then there's no training，two year training，there's no PCCL，that kind of stuff。

270
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:31,610
係啊，議員，其實 just to do fairness to the requirement of these courses，因為我我我唔 aware， and I also support。

271
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:41,100
to require those courses because especially conveyancing and basic law, constitutional law are totally different and.

272
00:37:41,380 --> 00:38:00,020
Like like you say in New York, New York bar or California bar, actually you take a master course there, then you can take the exam. But in Hong Kong, the students really have to complete four years undergrad. If we we don't talk about JD.

273
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:20,310
and then one year PCCL in order to be qualified. So we do have very serious and intensive training for the law graduates. So I think it is fair. Otherwise, it will become a shortcut for those who are not qualified to enter our law schools in Hong Kong, and then they just get that.

274
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,110
趨勢。

275
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:36,940
然後佢哋 come back喺一個非常 easy 路，所以， in fact， I I would like to see standards。 I from my suggestion is we should see standard。 I mean at least if they want to practice in Hong Kong， they should meet our standard。

276
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,210
We agree, and that's what we do.

277
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:51,570
I think today's discussion is focusing on one issue, which is the commencement date. So, unless there are any more questions relating to commencement date.

278
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,060
Well, this is related, so they are entitled to ask questions.

279
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,140
啊。

280
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:10,540
I wonder, I see. I'm not sure. Is that right? Are they related? I mean, we're talking about the substance of the exam. Yes, the exam has been approved by Legco. Legco members are entitled, and indeed, it is their duty to ask questions.

281
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,800
I see that there is another member, Mr. Porte. I

282
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,770
Otherwise, if you have no further questions, I intend to draw this meeting to a close. If there are no further issues.

283
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,040
我唔需要任何問題。謝謝。

284
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,380
係真。

285
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,850
今日下個禮拜先。

286
00:39:51,660 --> 00:40:10,220
啊！誒各位議員啊！誒頭先秘書就同我講，佢就話誒，如果今個禮拜五要即刻上呢個內會做報告咧，就可能未做得切，咁可能要到到下個禮拜五咧，我正係代表呢個委員會去做一個報告。咁如果係噉嘅話，可能要延展嗰個審議期係咪啊？

287
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,880
你下個禮拜三冇？

288
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:24,730
即係下個禮拜三大會，我會去誒誒動議係延展嗰個咩啊嗰個審議期。但係如果誒即係儘量做得唔得，如果唔我哋而家做唔做？

289
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,630
佢冇comment。

290
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,000
即係譬如。

291
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,380
OK。

292
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,540
今日禮拜二。

293
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,290
最遲禮拜四會出到嘅。

294
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,010
O.K.即後邊。

295
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,580
Okay.

296
00:40:42,330 --> 00:41:02,340
咁咁誒，秘書就驚真係未必講得切。咁如果真係盡量做啦嚇，如果做到講得切而可以將個報告咧嗰個草稿可以交畀律師會去審議，噉就如果做得切就禮拜五，我會代表呢個委員會咧係喺內會嗰度做一個報告。如果真係做唔切，我哋先係誒喺禮拜三。

297
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:22,350
嘅時候，下個禮拜三我動議去一個延展啦。噉就因為而家大會嗰個議程實在係好飄忽，因為我真係唔知道話如果你要提延展，係咪真係做到咧？如果真係做唔到噉，做到㗎啦，大生。嚇，OK，好，就就噉樣啦。如果各位委員冇其他問題或者意見嘅話咧，啊，法律顧問有冇其他？

298
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:31,550
乜嘢？嚇！咁好多謝今日啊出席嘅誒代表人士啦，嚇！噉就我會係代表呢個委員會做一個報告，嚇！會議結束。
