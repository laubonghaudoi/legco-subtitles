多啲多啊！

85
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,360
一個Playful。

86
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,140
好。

87
00:10:43,100 --> 00:11:03,110
噉我哋進入以前嘅第二項，就係西九文化區發展嘅進度彙報。誒文件咧就係C B會議三零六縮十四至十五誒括弧零一至零三文件嘅。噉我哋請秘書咧誒邀請西九管理局同埋我政府部門嘅代表進入。

88
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,770
好嘛？

89
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,910
好。

90
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:55,950
我哋好多謝誒民政事務局同埋誒西九管理局嘅代表。我哋首先請誒民政事務局常任秘書長馮婷淑儀女士誒同埋西九管理局代表咧介紹呢個文件啦。

91
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:16,240
啊，係咪啊？講解先係多謝主席。誒，今日我聯同西九管理局嘅誒各位嘅誒成員咧，係嚟到呢度咧向各位咧係介紹西九嘅文化區嘅進展。咁誒，首先我或者做一個簡單嘅介紹啦。其實喺過去數個月咧，西九文化區咧喺軟件同埋硬件嘅發展上面咧，都得到一啲進展嘅。

92
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:36,250
喺硬件工程方面咧，戲曲中心嘅地基建築嘅工程咧已經係完成咗。我哋會喺今年年底咧係開展嗰個大樓嘅建築嘅工程嘅。M+嘅地基工程亦都喺今年八月咧係動工啦。而誒另外一啲嘅展館，好似小型藝術館啊、西九公園啊，同埋係演藝劇場嘅設計工作咧，亦都係展開。

93
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:56,260
咁亦都希望能夠誒喺公園落成之前咧，畀到市民咧係享用呢個公共空間咧。西九管理局咧預算喺明年嘅下半年咧，會係首先咧係將一個嘅臨時嘅苗圃公園咧係誒開幕啟用畀市民係去享用嘅。咁但係亦都有一點係令到大家誒，我哋比較關心嘅咧就係關。

94
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:16,270
關於西九嘅綜合地庫同埋一啲嘅政府誒出資興建嘅工程咧，由於誒我哋喺上個立法年度咧已經將嗰個嘅申請撥款咧係入咗呢個誒喺公務小組委員會嗰度排緊隊等批核，咁但係到而家咧都仲未能夠審議到咧呢一個咧就可能將會影響到咧誒。

95
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:36,280
Plus嗰個嘅整個整體嗰個發展嘅，亦都令到整體嘅成本咧係增加，咁亦都影響埋演藝劇場同埋藝術廣場個地庫嘅設計嘅。咁所以非常之希望咧，係立法會能夠盡快咧係誒撥到呢一個嘅誒審審批到呢個撥款申請喺整體嘅規劃方面咧，管理局咧誒係。

96
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:56,290
向城市規劃委員會咧申請咧，係放寬西九用地嘅最大總樓面面積，同埋係最高建築物嘅高度限制。呢一個申請咧喺誒十一月十四號咧已經係獲得通過㗎啦。喺文化軟件方面嘅發展咧，西九管理局繼續咧係舉辦多項嘅表演同埋視覺藝術啦，嚟到拓展觀眾羣。

97
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:16,300
啱啱呢個週末咧，喺西九嗰度咧就係舉行咗自由野，係有超過四萬三千人咧係誒參加咗，亦都係一個紀錄嚟嘅。咁喺另外一方面嘅培養藝術人才啊，同埋係同持份者保持溝通咧，西九喺過去大半年咧亦都係做咗好多嘅功夫，喺公園個設計同管理咧。

98
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:36,310
咧，佢哋做咗一個好廣泛嘅誒公眾嘅意見收集，亦都將呢啲意見咧，將來會喺誒我哋明年咧會提交畀呢個誒立法會同埋特別呢個聯合小組委員會誒審議嘅嗰個公園附例嗰度咧，都會係反映呢啲嘅公眾嘅意見。管理局嘅文提交嘅文件咧，已經係報告咗誒上。

99
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:46,110
上述嘅情況，而家我請管理局行政總裁連立志先生咧，用投影片嘅方式嚟到向各位咧係介紹西九項目嘅最新嘅發展嘅。好啊，睇下。

100
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,400
鄰居。

101
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:57,260
Thank you, Betty. Mr Chairman, congratulations on your reappointment. Mr Deputy Chairman, congratulations.

102
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:17,630
After a somewhat eventful summer, very pleased to be back to be able to give you some indications of progress that's been made. There we are. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick photos from the Free Space Festival at the weekend, where, as Mrs Fung said, that was a very good.

103
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:25,780
event the third time that we've done the event and oh hang on sorry I just

104
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,020
Move forward. Yes, sorry.

105
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:51,210
Okay, great, thank you. Just wanted to quickly update you because we finished at about eleven thirty last night. Some forty-three thousand people attended. Working across the site, we had twenty thousand come on Saturday, twenty-three thousand on Sunday. As you're aware, the event was free.

106
00:15:51,210 --> 00:16:11,220
We also were able to utilise ferry transport for the first time to the site. All sorts of activity. Both, one of the high points was the orchestra on bicycles. Some very rather large overgrown penguins. Lots of music. La Fiera del Busto.

107
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:31,230
從西班牙，一些相當驚人的花式舞蹈項目，和一些很棒的項目，為全家人，包括這個項目，於週末進行，非常成功。然後是主要的付費活動，當晚的摩。

108
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:51,240
Laws production from Barcelona from La Fiera del Bas, so I think it was a very good way to reintroduce the concept of free spaces. We move on to talk about the buildings and to also reinforce the notion that as of this festival will now be in the.

109
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,730
position where the park will start to be closed. We'll have the temporary park open as. Thank you.

110
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:19,300
temporary park open by the middle of next year. So I'm just going to quickly run through a little developments on a number of fronts, including reference to the town planning board application for minor relaxation of the gross floor area that was approved by the town planning board on the fourteen.

111
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:39,310
I assume members may want to come back and have some further discussion about that. Just to reiterate where we are, Zhishu on the Canton Road end of the site. It's been now under construction for some fourteen months, and as of this week, we will conclude the found.

112
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,890
foundation and preliminary works.

113
00:17:42,370 --> 00:18:02,380
which will be an important step forward. On the other end of the site, design work on the park, the free space, the arts pavilion, now nearing completion with a view to the commencement of works. M Plus, we have commenced construction. I'll say a little bit about that. And the Lyric Theatre has.

114
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:22,390
Undergone substantial design work. Clearly, one of the issues in relation to M Plus and the lyric are the decisions by the Public Works and the Finance Committee in terms of the funding issues in regard to the basement. And clearly, the bigger, no longer term issue is the impact of.

115
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:30,870
The XRL on the project, including the already reported delays and some of the issues around that.

116
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:51,160
Zishu， I'm very pleased to report is now at the almost completed final stage. I think we have two more days' work to do on the actual centre on the foundation work, and then we will be announcing the we will be awarding the construction of.

117
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:08,720
the main superstructure within the next two weeks, and we believe construction will begin on the Zishu site in the second week of December. And now, in terms of the whole project, I think there's a real sense of

118
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:29,010
Achievement that we've got this to this point, and that we and that the decision to place this building on the Canton Road end of the site without any impacts from the XRL was an important step forward. We clearly feel excited by the.

119
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:38,390
idea of starting to build on the the building itself and with the other activities that are going on in other places. We'll talk a little bit about that down the track.

120
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:56,900
It was also incredibly gratifying last month to begin work on the foundations. Now that photo is a little is really the first steps in terms of M plus, but that work has accelerated greatly over the course of the last couple of weeks.

121
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:17,190
with the the work on the foundations, clearly integrally linked to the foundation projects and the public infrastructure works, and the work going on around the rest of the site. Completion for M Plus is anticipated in the first half of two thousand and eighteen, but

122
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:37,200
The important issue from our point of view is subject to the Finance Committee's approval of the funding applications for the related integrated basement and the public infrastructure works. But I think in terms of public perception, and clearly one of the issues well recognised by the crowd there for free space at the.

123
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:55,850
Again, was the idea that from the initial exhibition that took place earlier this year on Amplest and the architecture collection, we have now moved to the beginning of the work that will see that building in such a prominent site there by 2018.

124
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:16,560
Clearly, the park is really important, as members of this committee have made very clear, including the arts pavilion and the free space. We unveiled the concept design in July and briefed you or briefed the then committee on that. We have moved on substantially in terms of schematic design.

125
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:36,770
We have also, in terms of the overall delivery programme, the design team is adopting an organic approach. Both permanent development and interim improvement works are being planned, so that the work on the temporary park is now about to commence. Off the back of the events that took place this weekend and.

126
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:56,780
Next weekend, we will open that section of the park in early or the middle of two thousand and fifteen, with the works around the temporary tree nursery park and the ability to keep the park as a facility for the public right through the period of construction.

127
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:17,060
I think you will remember the concept design which I showed to members in July. The construction works are scheduled to commence around mid two thousand and fifteen, and then that clearly picks up the two pieces after we've opened up the part on the top.

128
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:31,140
左 hand corner, which will be the temporary park and the temporary performance space, the temporary bike track and the temporary access to the water. I might also point out that in regard to

129
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:51,430
The event we had at the weekend, testing the idea of the ferries, we used the ferry pontoons outside the project site office to be able to bring people from Hong Kong Island and from Kowloon to the site. We think that was a very good first step, and are hoping that.

130
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,740
We will be able to accelerate the work in terms of permanent ferry access.

131
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:18,780
The temporary park on the the top left hand corner is an important part of trying to ensure that we remain open for the public through the construction of the park. The nursery park, as you probably know now, has some one five hundred trees.

132
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:38,790
That were put there to be able to test and to develop them. The park designers in the process now of working on those trees with the the experts to work out where some of those trees will ultimately be relocated, which other trees need to be brought in.

133
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,250
要使個site work。

134
00:23:40,530 --> 00:24:00,540
Well, but we will be able to keep open, you know, that section of the site through the whole of the construction time, and I think that's an important recognition that always under some demand our public spaces in Hong Kong, we see that as a good way of being able to meet.

135
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,970
temporary demand.

136
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,950
嗯。

137
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:24,240
The lyric theatre, which we said a little bit about last time, will be the second major performing arts venue to be provided in West Kowloon after the Zeeshu. In May this year, we announced that the joint venture of AD and RG from Hong Kong and Nieuw Studio from Netherlands was selected to.

138
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:44,250
設計和 administer the construction of the Lyric Theatre. The work on the design has been going on over the last months. We're looking at some interesting challenges, both in terms of the basement issue, the proximity to M Place and the development of Artist Square. We're

139
00:24:44,250 --> 00:25:04,260
We're also undertaking some reviews at the moment to see whether we could bring that project a little bit forwards, so that we could safely say that all of this of the western end of the site could be completed by two thousand and twenty, which we think would be an important step.

140
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:24,270
在整個發展，The Artis Square site is really and in addition to the park, will be our priority. In addition to ZHU, clearly there are issues reflecting the XRL project, the issues in regard to.

141
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:44,280
the funding of the integrated basement and the delays on the XRL project. So our focus is very much to deliver the issue, to be able to then look at both the the cultural facilities, the OACF facilities, some of the income producing activity.

142
00:25:44,280 --> 00:26:04,290
The first of the residential and the office space and the artist's hostel project that we're looking at doing next to the Cross Harbour Tunnel, that is very much the priority at the moment, and clearly we can accommodate that within the.

143
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:18,090
Funding packages, we just hope that we're able to deal with some of the the timing issues on that. In parallel to that, will be the all of the park project, which will roll out over the course of the next two years.

144
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:29,350
And we see that as very much. If we are able to deliver all of those facilities by 2020, we think that augurs well for the future development of the rest of the site.

145
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:49,970
我 just wanted to move on quickly, talk a little bit more about the intensity of the audience and capacity building that's been going on. You know, in working on cultural software development, particular audience building and capacity building, and I think some of the things that like to draw to your attention, clearly.

146
00:26:49,970 --> 00:27:02,390
M Plus's representation at Art Basel in Hong Kong, and was important in I think both focusing attention on the collection, focusing attention on the beginning of the building.

147
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:23,130
We attracted over 12,000 people to the stand that we set up in the foyer there, and I think that was a good way of reinforcing the messages going forward. We've been doing a number of other major community works, take a swing in Yamate Community Rest Garden.

148
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:43,140
五千老、young， and even all sorts of people there. Which was in July. I thought that was a very successful activity in broadening out within our local community the idea of the role that dance and performance takes within the site. We've also done

149
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:56,070
Done some really, I think, groundbreaking work in terms of what's happening on our website and our associate websites, and what we're doing in terms of moving into the digital world.

150
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:16,360
the online exhibition project Mobile M Plus was a huge success. We've also launched a major new initiative called Decade, an interactive music and film platform inviting the public to create their own interpretation of Hong Kong through decades by rearranging the 10 film.

151
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,200
film clips and ten music accompaniments created by the artists. I think that's been very popular project.

152
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:43,600
我已經説過一點關於FreeSpace，我只係 glad that it didn't rain。 The forty-three thousand participants participated in a whole range of things， both from local performers and some international performers across dance， music， literary arts， physical theatre， as well as the farmers。

153
00:28:43,600 --> 00:29:03,610
market， no a flea market。We really focused this year on the idea of audience participation， where the performers worked closely with the local community。The first interactive anchor show， MURS， which created a really interesting。

154
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:23,620
Different experience, I think, for Hong Kong audiences. We sold that show, and that was sold out as part of the overall festival. I'd like to share a few of the other upcoming events. Rising Stars. As you know, we're not able to put the Bamboo Theatre on the site because of the building works.

155
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:43,720
This coming year, so we are now undertaking an extension of the whole Rising Stars in Cantonese Opera. Fourteen young Cantonese opera artists performed, and we're now we're going to extend that project and undertake the project through Chinese New Year and.

156
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:59,950
And after that, at Ko Shan Theatre Annex, the new wonderful space that was only opened a couple of weeks ago, that will take place over 10 days. And Mr Lo Kau Ying is invited to curate the performances.

157
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:20,260
We are also moving to do a number of other major mobile M Plus events, including moving images. The first time we've dealt with the issue of moving image, that's going to be a really important step forward, showcasing Hong Kong work and.

158
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:38,010
the connections to the moving image program, we see that as a very interesting way of connecting the the film, the multimedia and the visual arts communities together. Tentatively programmed at this stage for February to April 2015.

159
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:58,920
After, oh sorry, let me just go back one. Importantly, to recognise that after the successful Lee Kit exhibition at the 2013 Venice Biennale, we were invited by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council to collaborate with them again for 2015.

160
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:18,930
The dates of that have now changed, and we'll start in May two thousand and fifteen. So we're working on a rather aggressive timeline. We've selected Changkin Wah, who had been one of the artists we highlighted in our mobile Yamate project two years ago.

161
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:37,100
作為藝術家代表香港，我們看到現在正在發展的藝術，我認為會進一步加強香港在威尼斯雙年展的關係，並讓香港藝術家受到更多關注。

162
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,730
我們也已經在進行一連串的學術辯論，就係關於。

163
00:31:43,010 --> 00:32:03,020
With experts from all over the world, seminars, workshops, training programmes, internship schemes and other collaborative projects. We've also been doing work on new work to be able to make sure that the local arts community are moving in line with our plan.

164
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:23,030
plans for the buildings to be able to look at being able to create new work, innovative work, to be able to be there when the venues have opened. And also on that front, we've been doing significant events as part of the M Plus Matters series, exploring critical issues with key players from across.

165
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:39,800
The world in the visual arts field, which I think have highlighted both the increasing significance of the visual arts in Hong Kong, the increasing interest in M Plus's activities and in the broader development of the Hong Kong artists.

166
00:32:40,970 --> 00:33:00,980
I think also it's probably important just to reiterate. Within all the programmes, we're looking at very expanded fellowship programmes, internship programmes across all sides of our activity, and that's going to be an important next step as we prepare the next business plan for 2015.

167
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:20,990
Onwards, and just finally on the stakeholder and public engagement, you will be aware ongoing dialogue with the arts community, looking at the development of the buildings, looking at the preferred uses of the buildings and the impacts on the local companies. The consultation panel has received significant.

168
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:41,000
In focus, in helping us gauge public views on on issues like the park, the bylaws, the development of the the park overall. Over three thousand people were collected, or responses were collected, and seven focus groups involving over fifty people were held. Those views.

169
00:33:41,000 --> 00:34:01,010
were a valuable input into what we're doing. We're now in the process of finalising the bylaws, taking into account the park's vision, mission, as well as the public views, and we'll be bringing those back to a hopefully a very close future meeting, because we would want to have some sense.

170
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:19,130
of understanding within the temporary park of of how those things were going to happen. So I think that's it, Mr. Chairman. I'm very happy to answer specific questions along the way. Okay.誒，多謝Mr. Lin.誒，而家咧就大家提問嘅時間。頭先舉咗手有黃碧雲、陳婉嫻，請大家繼續舉手。

171
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:39,630
馬逢國、李慧瓊、陳志全，仲有黃碧雲，每人四分鐘，聯問聯答啊。誒，主席誒，西九文化區，我哋最關心兩樣嘢啦，即係個錢啦、進度啦。咁當然頭先講嗰啲，即係誒軟件啊、誒嗰啲，都係我哋關心。我特別關心。

172
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,720
心咧就係嗰個進度啊！

173
00:34:42,000 --> 00:35:02,010
即係西九文化區嗰度咧，有部分土地同高鐵嗰個總站重疊，噉係誒有我唔記得幾多公頃啦，就係借咗畀高鐵嗰邊。我想問下，而家佢哋誒同誒西九文化區，你哋呢一邊係咪有協議？大概？

174
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,220
幾時佢哋會可以交翻曬所有土地出嚟，而唔影響而家呢一個嘅工程嘅進度嘅咧？

175
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:29,730
誒邊位答答？誒西九。Well, no, I think the issue in regard to the XRL site clearly, you know, the reality is that the the project is going slower than we would have hoped. The XRL had a short term licence over a large part of the site to be used as their work site.

176
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:49,740
Their bargeing points, and for specific works that are being both done under our site and on the adjoining site, our focus over the last year and a half, recognising some of the issues, was to focus on the zhu end and on.

177
00:35:49,740 --> 00:36:09,750
The area of Artis Square and the park, so that we our focus in the batch one venues and hopefully the batch two venues is that we would complete the batch one venues, do Artis Square, do the park, do Zee Shu, and then by that stage the XRL would have moved.

178
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:29,760
Moved out of the site, and subject to the resolution of the funding of the integrated basement, we would then be in a position to finalise the the two remaining batch two venues, and then be able to start looking at the the longer term future of the site. We don't need that site.

179
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:48,810
at this point, all of the venues, with the exception of the two of the smaller theatre venues, are venues for from batch three, and largely the sale of the office and residential spaces to the north of the site, as you can see on on that map.

180
00:36:49,840 --> 00:37:09,850
主席有時間嚇。誒，我想問就而家我哋誒會分期做嘅，我知道嚇。就誒個大概咧係會先做好個小西九先。嗰個小西九係誒應該大概係二零二零係咪？即係你哋而家嗰個計劃係完成曬小西九。

181
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,050
係咪？

182
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:17,800
咁而家我想問咧，就係話個成個大西九係咪而家係冇時間表㗎？

183
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,180
成個西九文化區其他嘅部分，答一答啦，係嘛？

184
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:42,650
Well, no, we have a timetable. In I think we've always said when we announced more than a year ago the change timetable, batch one and batch two by early two thousand and twenty-two, and then batch three was likely to be no sometime over the next six or eight years beyond.

185
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:49,000
That subject to where we were on funding and resolution of any of those other issues.

186
00:37:50,090 --> 00:38:10,100
主席，咁即係話，其實成個大西九咧，我哋都唔確定係咪真係會起得到喎？有幾個重要嘅場館，噉啊，即係話要睇下有冇資金咁噉，所以即係話資金同埋時間表都唔係好確定嘅。關於大西九，係咪可以咁講？因為上一次上上一。

187
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:30,110
次會議咧就上幾次會議咧，應該畀嗰個表就係分兩兩三個stage嘅去起嗰啲誒建築物嘅。噉我諗佢再畀翻，再重新再畀個我哋加埋一個timeline，即係如果即係已經確定嘅建築嘅嘅工程嘅有timeline啦。係啊，馮太主席，其實誒事務。

188
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:50,120
副司長喺誒今年嘅五月咧嚟到立法會交代嘅時候咧，已經講咗我哋而家嘅資金咧係足夠誒，應該係可以足夠起第一同第二期嘅設施。咁上次啊，主席頭先提到嗰個表咧，都列出咗第一、第二期嘅設施係包括啲乜嘢。咁當然第一期就係誒，而家已經係有啲係工作係開展咗嘅，包括誒氣局中心啦、M plus啦。

189
00:38:50,120 --> 00:39:10,130
誒公園啦，同埋係誒我哋嗰個小型嘅演藝場地啦。咁至於第二期嗰個演藝中心咧，已經係開始咗嗰個設計工作。噉我哋仲有兩個係第二期嘅場地咧，就係一個嘅誒當代藝術嘅表演場地，同埋一個係中型劇場，都係喺第二期嘅。就呢啲咧，我哋誒而家目前咧都係希望喺二零二。

190
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:30,140
二二年咧係做好個工程，跟住係稍後嗰兩年咧就會係開幕。呢個仍然係而家嘅時間表。但係第三期咧，包括係誒另外一啲嘅設施咧，譬如大劇院咧，暫時我哋係冇一個實際嘅時間表嘅。咁呢個嘅文件我哋可以再向誒立法會嗰度再畀翻嚟。唔係，再畀翻嗰個表同埋加埋第一期嗰個timeline。

191
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,330
準確一啲詳細嘅timeline啦，好嘛？下一位陳婉霞，唔該主席。

192
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,190
因為誒，我諗呢個我係我哋誒關心嘅問題嚟嘅。

193
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:59,480
因為嗱，如果按照而家我同業主要講，上次係有個三三個階段性，我哋知嘅，亦都知道你嘅錢只能夠去到第二嘅啫。咁即係話我哋都好清楚嘅。而家問題咧就話誒喺第二嘅呢嘅期間裏邊咧，你當中牽涉到有個嗰個地庫嘅問題嗱。

194
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,540
地庫嗰個，我冇印冇冇記錯印象，你係而家冇錢嘅。

195
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,170
啱唔啱啊？

196
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:13,360
啱唔啱啊？我我哋係需要嚟立法會申請個。冇錯啦，咁變咗嗰個度地方，可能牽涉到你第二期嘅工程㗎喎。

197
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,720
噉你呢個問題，你點處理咧？

198
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,320
係邊位答？誒，主席，我哋係其實誒。

199
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,300
會。

200
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:41,590
In regard to the integrated basement, we're hopeful that the processes of the ledge go will allow those decisions to be made over the course of next year, so that that work which has to happen before you can do anything above the ground, that that work is able to happen, and then we'd be able to move forward. You know, any of those.

201
00:40:41,590 --> 00:41:01,600
venues，the remaining venues in batch two，and then the future planning of the batch three venues，the office residential and commercial space that will be built over that whole part of the site。Our focus，as we said last time，is very much to

202
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:16,530
deliver the western end of the site by 2020 and then be able to move forward beyond that point once we've resolved some of the difficult issues like the funding for the integrated basement.

203
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:36,840
我諗阿馮太係啊，主席或者答翻阿陳議員嘅提問咧。其實關於個綜合地庫咧，我哋就誒都成政政務司司長咧，我哋西九管理顧局嘅主席咧，亦都係講咗咧，政府係會承擔嗰個綜合地庫個建造嗰個費用。咁其實我哋都係會分期咧嚟立法會度申請嗰撥款。第一個申請其實已經而家係。

204
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:56,850
喺公務小組委員會嗰度排緊隊，係應該係第以前第七項嘅，據我瞭解。咁咧就誒嗰度就係佢第一期申請款，就係喺翻M plus嘅地庫嚟嘅嗰個part。咁稍後出年年中咧，我哋會再嚟咧係申請第二期嘅錢咧，就係做其他嘅設計同埋係一啲基建嘅工作嘅。咁所以誒地庫嘅錢係。

205
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:16,860
會分期嚟立法會係攞唔亦唔單止係影響第二期嘅發展，其實第一期嘅地庫咧，亦都要係盡快攞到個錢先可以興建到。呢個我哋知嘅，所以咧就話你剛才咁講咧，實講到個進展咧，我就覺得你講係即係誒總監講咧，係一啲屬於點講啊？係啲係表表面嘅。

206
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:30,660
嘅即係嘅狀況啦，咁所以變咗咧就我自己我自己覺得就話，你如果最後要預期去到二零二零嗰啲或二零二嗰啲咧，你包括Amicus啊，包括一啲嘅等等咧，我覺得係基本上就。

207
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:51,210
你得個講啫喎！嗱，我唔知道立法會嘅情況點樣，但係成個政府要有個準備㗎嘛。即係政府有個準備嘅呢個政治現實就噉樣啦。你排第七，可能去到一年後都攞唔到都唔出奇。咁變咗你成個政府喺董事局裏邊係咪有個處理呢個問題咧？就咪等我哋嘅。如果等我哋講咧？

208
00:42:51,210 --> 00:43:11,220
老實講，我覺得係好唔現實啦。咁所以變咗，我覺得你係有個，即係我上次都同阿李太講，即係我哋都提出咗呢扎問題出嚟嘅，即係話你要一個就時間嘅問題，但係又牽涉到你有筆錢係未有嘅，可唔可以喺第二期裏面嘅資金調撥？我唔知你點樣應付，係咪就話哦，我你唔畀錢我啊，我就調咗去上上高啦？噉我覺得即係。

209
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:31,230
呢個拗氣，即係個你要有個誒行政嘅現實，你要處理㗎呢個問題啦。另外個問題咧就有關剛才咧就誒總監都提到有關嗰啲即係佈局嘅問題，我係好關心即係泊車位嘅規劃啊、零售同飲食嘅規劃，同埋碼頭理論上就而家我哋去到二零二零咧，都係要有成好多年啦。

210
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:51,240
二二年到好多年咧，喺呢啲期間，你有好多好多活動㗎，好似自由嘢噉樣。就例如碼頭嘅，你到底係點樣去處理咧？我都覺得主席喺啲地方佢重疊嘅問題未解決嘅。我哋認為有啲嘢放咗提前嘅，例如碼頭嗰啲又點去處理咧？噉你再再需要成國管理，我就覺得西九管理局裏邊喺啲問題上咧，就一個。

211
00:43:51,240 --> 00:44:11,250
平嘅睇件事發展，客觀上你好多而家未處理到㗎嘛。明白噉，所以我嗱，主席，我唔知係咪應該政府咧，即係我今朝發覺咧，就唔好意思，我無無意挑撥矛盾。不過就覺得好多時咧，就一去到我哋想問阿馮晴淑兒講嘅嘢咧，就誒總監要要要出去講嘢㗎啦。噉我就覺得我呢單嘢咧，錢係我哋畀出嘅香。

212
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:17,650
冇人畀嘅監察，成個政府監察嘅調咗個李太過嚟，咁李太到底個角色係監察説點咧？

213
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:38,180
即係你，你而家做唔到嘢，我覺得，我覺得做唔到嘢喎，主席空中流國在而家嗰啲啊。我諗OK嘅嘅，我哋清楚㗎啦。我諗我都會會後咧，即係將你頭先所講嘅嘢咧排一個隊咧，從即係逐個逐個，我哋都會問嘅，好立體性咁問。噉啊，馮太嗰度咧，我諗就好唔好會後咧，你都畀一個。

214
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:58,190
個時間表即係你未必全部畀到嘅成個地庫，即係你會睇咩時候會嚟攞邊部分錢，邊部分錢大概總共你誒計到就計啦，係嘛？但係起碼前頭嗰個stage one、stage two，你都可能會有一個約摸嘅數計到出嚟嘅，咁可能加一份文件上嚟，好嘛？誒排隊再。

215
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,060
要跟啦，好冇？好多人跟佢啊！阿馮，阿馬馮國。

216
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:12,790
誒，多謝主席。我兩個問題。誒，首先係再一次申報咧，我係西九管理局嘅董事咧，係最近得到即係再一次任命，需要再申報。

217
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:33,080
誒，我第一個問題咧，就想了解一下誒。其實咧，我都瞭解，都都我跟得都幾貼嘅，就係今自從今年年初咧，誒電影界咧就對即係西九個發展裏邊咧誒過去一段時間冇考慮到即係電影界嗰個需要咧，就有好強烈嘅意見啦。咁喺誒其後。

218
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:53,090
後嘅見行政長官誒嗰度咧，就得到行政長官一個比較明確嘅即係支持嘅態度啦。咁之後通過我嘅努力咧，誒電影界都同西九開咗誒一個溝通嘅會。咁之後咧亦都有好多嘅書信嘅來往啦。誒包括佢哋提出幾樣嘢，就係西九應該係增

219
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:13,100
加一個電影元素，第二咧就係應該有場地咧係可以畀誒電影界咧係有一個好好嘅誒誒誒大型嘅節慶嘅活動或者頒獎禮嘅活動啦。第三就係希望有一個比較誒似樣嘅一個大型嘅電影放映場地啦，去舉行一啲經常性嘅首映首映禮。

220
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:33,110
活動啦，同埋有恆常嘅喺西九嘅未來咧，係應該係可以觀賞電影嘅一個場地噉樣。咁咧，即係我就好想咧，即係借今日嘅機會咧，就即係畀誒管理局又好，政府又好咧，公開咁去回應一下咧，即係呢一啲噉嘅誒誒嘅訴求啦。呢個係第一點。咁第二點咧，就我就關心到嗰個。

221
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:53,120
地庫嘅問題咧，地庫嗰個融資咧，咁即係政府曾經講過咧，就係誒願意係即係承擔成個地庫嗰個工程嘅。咁而家咧，即係工程嗰度嘅規劃同埋落實咧，要馬上開始啦。咁但係咧嚟誒立法會撥款嘅時候咧，往往又會受到好大嘅拖延。噉我想問下咧，其實點樣誒政府有咩？

222
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:02,910
嘅打算去落實誒西九地庫嗰個建設工程嗰個撥款嚇，令到呢個計劃可以誒順利進行咧。多謝主席。不過馮太講咗地庫先。

223
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:23,210
誒主席就誒關於地庫嘅資料咧，我哋其實誒五月嘅時候畀過一啲即係好粗略嘅資料。咁到而家我諗，我哋都有啲嘅即係誒更新，可以係稍後會後畀翻大家。我哋而家規劃到咧，去到二零一六一七咧，係都睇到嗰個撥款嗰個分期係點樣樣個數數額係幾多，都可以畀翻立法會噉。

224
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:43,220
誒，至於頭先阿陳議員同埋阿馬議員問到咧，關於立法會批核嗰個誒地庫工程嘅款項同埋其他基建嘅款項受到阻延咧，我哋其實而家係同西九管理局咧都喺度研究緊有啲咩可行嘅方案。咁但係因為誒西九管理局自己嗰個嘅撥款咧，二十二百一十六億咧係有一個使使用嘅限制嘅，即係可以。

225
00:47:43,220 --> 00:48:03,230
使啲喺啲乜嘢上面唔可以使喺啲乜嘢上面咁喺究竟中間有幾多嘅空間係可以走賺咧？呢度我哋都同翻有關嘅政府部門喺度研究緊。咁但係我哋而家最急切嘅就係話，我哋而家申請緊嗰誒第一期嘅三億咧，係必須要盡快攞到，就係因為喺amplas嘅下邊。咁呢度有冇其他嘅權益嘅地方咧？我

226
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:16,470
希望或者係下一次嘅小組委員會咧，我哋可以嚟到呢一度咧，係同大家再匯報嗰個方案係點樣樣嘅。而家係同管理局方面咧都研究緊呢方面嘅問題。好啊，誒請阿Mr Lynch講一講電影工業嗰個問題。

227
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,330
Yeah, thank.

228
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:39,070
Thanks, Mr Chairman. Thanks, Mr Maher. We've had some very constructive engagement, and I thank you for your engagement with the film community around, in particular, the issue of the lyric theatre and the increase in capacity of the lyric theatre, if possible, to be able to ensure that for big.

229
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:59,080
For film openings and for the Hong Kong Film Festival, that the Lyric Theatre would be able to be used as a substantial new injection of quality film space. We see that as very much part of the planning that's going on at the moment. Clearly, the issue within M Plus itself.

230
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:19,090
There is provision for the more artistic side of the film business. The project that I mentioned earlier, the Moving Image Project, is an important step at bridging the relationship between the visual arts and the film community, and we see it as important to know to be able to look at whether there might be.

231
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:39,100
Commercial facilities there, within some of the other buildings that might address the film industry's concerns. Although we are also recognising that the building we've got substantial commercial cinema complexes in elements next door to us, and that.

232
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:53,220
那會really be dependent probably on the the next stage of the commercial development, rather than what we're doing at the moment. But we see it really is important. I think no, I think to have a venue like the Lyric Theatre of

233
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:13,510
with capacity for one thousand four hundred and fifty seats would be a really valuable injection to the film industry in terms of those opening events, some of which have even been shot on our site. would be great idea to be able to be able to use them in a more constructive way to continue to showcase it while.

234
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:31,500
At the same time, recognising that film, multimedia and the digital side will be an important part of both what's in the collection. For M Plus, we have many pieces of work that have been bought on that front, and that will provide good interface between the visual arts community and the film community.

235
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:40,030
好啦，多謝你。我諗你哋翻去諗下，睇電影工業有咩貢獻啦，細九即係嚇，唔係淨係場地方面。請李慧瓊。

236
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:53,790
係，誒主席，而家咧臨地庫嘅撥款能唔能夠得到立法會嘅通過位支持咧，成為西九項目嘅一個非常重要嘅關鍵。誒，我我想了解下咧，你而家就排緊隊啦，若然。

237
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:14,330
誒能夠順利通過固然最好啦。若然係會延遲或者係啊大幅都未能夠獲得通過，其實對於嗰個誒成本會有幾大影響？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題就係政府都要作幾手準備啦。頭先議員都提醒政府或者要求政府咁做，我想問下啦。若然真係本會唔能夠通過呢啲？

238
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:34,340
其實有乜嘢實質嘅誒計劃嘅咧嚇？呢個第二個問題，第三個問題咧，我想問翻咧就係嗯文件嘅第三段咧，你就講到咧就話西九文化區同鄰近地區嘅連接事宜。噉我見今日嘅工作報告咧就冇講你哋喺上次會議之後，二零一三年啊。

239
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:54,350
十二月十七號之後咧，實質有咩工作進度嘅？我觀察咧就係嗰度依然唔算係一個非常暢達嘅地方，尤其是個西九嗰個海濱長廊。誒，第二咧就係嗰個停車位依然係不足嘅。咁呢段時間你哋落實咗啲乜嘢改善措施，令到佢同啊周邊嗰個？

240
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,990
鄰近地區嘅連接更加大咧。

241
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:17,280
唔該，阿馮太先答埋嗰個地庫。誒，其實剛才都講過，我哋係誒絕對明白嗰個嘅誒撥款阻延咗咧，對於成個西九嘅發展係有好大影響。咁誒而家最誒緊要嘅咧就係第一期，頭先我哋講到嗰個申請，下一期其實咧就係二零一五年嘅年中到咧，我哋。

242
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:37,290
打算咧係嚟立法會申請第二期嘅錢。噉我哋而家先先咧同西九管理局研究緊第一期。如果去到出年今年年底、出年年初都攞唔到呢個撥款嘅時候，嗰個處理嘅方法，我哋誒想係同西九管理局傾咗、傾好咗之後咧，我哋先至嚟立法會嗰度去彙報。因為而家暫時我哋都未能夠傾到一個確實嘅方案。

243
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:57,300
案咁誒有一啲方案係考慮緊嘅，噉我希望稍後可以又同誒議員去匯報翻。咁至於出年年中嗰一期咧，我哋都諗緊其他有冇啲方案咧，係可以誒，即係儘量用到西九自己嘅資源去做一啲工作，而係又符合咗佢個西九嘅撥款嗰個範圍，可唔可以噉樣樣做到咧？

244
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:17,310
呢啲都係我哋去諗緊一啲方案，但係因為牽涉嘅錢係好多，下一期我哋可能嚟申請係講緊係誒四十億嘅嘅錢，咁所以變咗咧嗰個西九自己可唔可以動用到自己嘅撥款嚟到去做呢啲工程咧，都係一個好大嘅疑問。咁如果用咗嘅時候，佢自己又可以起嘅嘢又會可能係少咗，所以好多方案都仲係。

245
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,550
喺度研究緊嘅。

246
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,520
Okay, Mr. Lin.

247
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,570
連接性咧，誒請啊或者西九嗰邊。

248
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:46,310
Yeah, thanks, Miss Lee. I guess the point that we've in my earlier comments, we have kept the public space open up to this point, and we will keep it open until early next year. But to do the the necessary work that you've talked about in terms of

249
00:53:46,340 --> 00:54:06,350
the the waterfront, the tracks, the infrastructure, the trees, the buildings that are going to be in the park, the arts pavilion and the free space. It is just not possible to do the work and to build the park at the same time. So the

250
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:26,360
主席和秘書長在上次會議中，提出在這個公園的北部部分設立一個臨時公園，這個公園將會在公園建設完成後的兩年內保持開放。

251
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:46,370
We've been doing substantial work with the transport department in looking at both the issues of interrelationship between our site and the other sites, the impacts on the new XRL site. So connectivity is still one of the three.

252
00:54:46,370 --> 00:55:06,380
Embedded principles. The ferry project that we did at the weekend with Free Space was meant as the first step to see whether the people of Hong Kong would embrace the idea of using ferry transport to get to West Kowloon. It's always been regarded by us as a fundamental precept of making.

253
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:26,390
making it accessible and making it connected, and also taking advantage of the fantastic site. I was very pleased to see the response over the course of Saturday and Sunday to the ferries. gives me absolute confidence that ferry transport or water taxi transport will be real.

254
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:44,030
really important. The only issue for us is beyond what we've just had approved by the town planning board and what's approved in the development plan. We now have to progress, which we will do over the course of the the coming months. The two proposals for piers on on the side of the park.

255
00:55:45,240 --> 00:56:05,250
O.K.，我諗誒答答得唔係咁好啦。依個我諗會誒揾個時間咧，我哋會詳細講即係西九同埋鄰近地區嘅交通連接啊，或者其他嘅交通安排。我諗我哋誒會揾一個時間詳細再傾一傾有關工程啊、交通啊等等呢啲噉嘅連接性嘅問題啦，好唔好啊？

256
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:26,580
多謝主席。噉我第一個都係關心Empress地庫前期工程啦。咁政府就講話即係擔心嗰個撥款嘅延誤，我想佢可以清楚啲講你嘅預算而家嘅日期係幾時通過公務小組委員會，再去埋財委會係攞到呢個撥款。

257
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:46,660
點樣至係你嘅理想日子？點樣至叫延誤咧？啊喺文件裏邊，你話你哋有一個審批進度噉，去到點樣至叫延誤？同埋話嗯呢個前期工程如果遲咗，就會對西九其他場地發展帶嚟深遠嘅成。

258
00:56:46,660 --> 00:57:06,670
成本及時間影響噉，梗係好嚴重啦。即係講到，但係聽頭先聽誒阿馮太講嘢話，即係出年中期嗰個，你話四十億就好難自己調配啊。咁言下之意，呢三億半就好似可以自己調配到喎，係咪噉嘅意思咧？咁呢個係第一條題目。第二個題目就係關於。

259
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:26,680
頭先講開自由嘢，噉我琴日都有去到啦。咁順從人數講，四萬幾人去都係即係叫做成功啦，因為呢個項目都係招牌菜，係令到每年啲公眾可以即係認識，真係去到呢個西九文化區嚇。以前佢嘅印象就係一笪空地，誒，可能地產項目，可能大白象工程，但係自由嘢畀大家。

260
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:46,690
去到，但係純從人數嘅誒去評估佢成功失敗咧，我就覺得唔夠嘅。即係琴日都好多不愉快嘅經驗，我我諗你哋可能都會聽到，例如我哋行成半個鐘至行到去啦，因為太多人啦。啊，由呢個港鐵站同埋咧中間如果有車過咧，嗰啲客咧係被啲工作員呼喝。

261
00:57:46,690 --> 00:58:06,700
呼喝佢哋行翻上去誒行人路嗰度，同埋有啲的士可能你嘅指示唔夠，佢駛入咗去之後咧，誒行錯路入咗你個範圍咧，好似捉賊咁咧，成班人圍佢，跟住唔畀佢落車，因為佢嗰個位唔準落車，跟住嗰啲人係要落車喎，噉就產生一啲衝突。即係我唔想大家去到西九第一次經驗就會係。

262
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:26,710
有啲唔愉快嘅經歷，所以呢一啲你哋搞呢啲活動嘅時候都要好好去檢討。不過，我想問翻自由野嗰一個問題就係由賣飛變到送飛咧，呢個我都係解我唔明嘅，即係即係本身就賣飛都賣咗兩成半，後來你哋中間決定係免費，咁呢個決定個時間係點樣嘅咧？因為連先生，你你當。

263
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:44,630
出嚟答就話，整個文化區咧明年就會關閉啦，進行建築工程，希望有更多人可以趁住最後呢一次喺海濱長廊舉行活動嚟西九睇下，決定免費入場。但係呢個你唔係講下先知㗎嘛，你成個計劃你計劃賣飛嘅時候，其實你已經知個時間表，你幾時關閉，你係。

264
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:55,320
想鼓勵多啲人嚟㗎嘛？咁咧，今年事前你又決定賣飛咧？O K，我諗阿馮太簡單啲答個地庫嗰個誒誒，我想揾阿馮太答先啊，我問住你答。

265
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:15,610
誒，關於啊，陳議員提嘅問題咧，就誒誒，其實嗰個時間表咧，其實係好緊迫嘅。我哋喺五月嚟立法會嘅時候咧，就已經係講咗，我哋希望第一次嘅撥款咧，喺夏季咧係批到嘅，即係今年嘅夏季已經過咗啦。因為當時時咧，我哋準備咧誒，西九係會誒批出嗰個嘅M plus嘅地啊。

266
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:35,620
嗰個嘅地基嘅工程嘅，咁其實喺個地基工程裏邊咧，有一個嘅選擇咧，就係話佢哋係可以邀請埋呢個嘅地基嘅嘅工程嘅成成建商咧，係起埋呢一個地庫嘅工程嘅，呢個係一個選擇。咁所以而家我哋個即係急嘅地方咧，就係個地基工程咧，其實出年八月就已經係做完㗎啦。咁如果我哋喺呢個人哋做完之前，都唔能夠話。

267
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:55,630
畀人聽起唔起埋呢一個嘅地庫嘅工程咧嘅地基咧，就係一個即係好大嘅損失，而亦引致到咧洗費咧係會多咗。而喺我哋畀立法會誒嗰個補充文件嗰度咧，我哋都提到咧誒，如果係成個M plus嘅每一個誒嘅延期每一個月咧，係牽涉係二千萬嗰個嘅財政嘅影響嘅，即係。

268
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:15,640
因為因為跟住嗰個嘅誒誒通脹啊，同埋係建造費嘅增加咧，以百分之六嚟到計咧，每一個月係增加二千萬嘅開支，所以唔淨止個工程地基工程增加，而係嗰個成個M plus嘅上蓋工程咧，個費用都會增加。咁呢筆三億半係咪可以自己調到咧？頭先即係我你你講。

269
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:35,650
係啊，你個deadline啊，同埋啲三億半係。頭先我講嗰個嘅option咧，即係話係佢請埋M plus嘅地基嘅嗰個嘅建造商做咧，我哋希望最遲最遲其實喺個合約裏面寫咗最遲一月咧係需要有呢一個嘅決定。如果唔係咧就係誒好難再加到落去，同埋跟住嗰個延期嗰個引。

270
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:55,660
個財政影響係好大，咁三億係咪可以自己付咧？呢個亦都要睇翻究竟西九是否可以付呢一筆錢啦，同埋咧係將來付咗呢筆錢之後攞唔攞得翻啦？攞唔翻嘅時候會對成個西九嗰個嘅財政都有好大影響。好啊，Mr. Linch，你簡單答一答自由嘢，點解由賣飛變咗送飛咧？好嘛？Yeah, I thank you very much.

271
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:15,670
For coming, I'm sorry it was a difficult experience for you. I guess the issue is just to clarify a couple of points. We have never charged for free space. We were proposing this year to charge a $50 entrance fee because there'd been some discussion at our board level and in

272
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:35,680
在更廣泛的狀況下，有人、人民應該作出一些貢獻。我認為當我們規劃《Free Space》時，這個理論並沒有站得住腳。那是一個非常困難的時期，在香港，我們決定最好還是讓我們自己來做。

273
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:55,690
free in line with the first two festivals. We haven't know which we didn't charge anything for. I think that decision was right, but we clearly were always a little bit unsure as to what the audience expectation would be when it was free. We had twenty zero people there for the first.

274
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:15,700
第一個free space， 30,000 for the second free space， and then 43,000 yesterday. And so I think that led us to, you know, I think it was the right decision to open it up as much as we could to Hong Kong. But the space is a the space we had in the previous two was much larger than the space.

275
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:26,100
We had yesterday because of the building projects. So, you know, we learn something on that, and clearly we'll, you know, be able to look at that in terms of any of the other projects. Okay, time up.

276
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,330
誒，跟住副主席嚇。

277
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,570
多謝主席。

278
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:43,810
誒，我諗咧喺香港即係搞文化藝術嘅人咧，尤其是即係連立志先生同埋你嘅團隊咧，一定會。

279
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:52,160
為而家雨傘運動喺廣場上邊見到嘅嗰種文化創意同埋藝術咧，係感到好驕傲嘅。

280
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,530
誒。

281
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:03,340
當然，呢個唔係去討論誒喺廣場上面嘅學生同埋參與者嘅政治訴求嘅場合。

282
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,300
但係，我想喺度講嘅就係。

283
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,780
究竟？

284
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:17,870
即係如果我哋見到喺廣場上邊層出不窮、令人耳目一新嘅，無論文化藝術嘅作品。

285
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:25,100
誒喺西九個團隊嗰度有冇一啲誒想法？

286
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,810
即係因為我自己咧，就有一個噉嘅反省嘅。

287
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,480
即係原來咧。

288
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,400
文化藝術咧係唔需要點樣設計嘅。

289
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,500
即係你，只要畀到一個空間咧。

290
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:53,890
其實香港人嗰個創意咧，無論喺藝術文化方面咧，都可以發揮得淋漓盡致嘅。呢個從我哋喺雨傘廣場上面見到嘅作品已經係。

291
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,430
好清楚。

292
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:06,610
噉我想問下咧，即係誒點樣可以將呢個香港人嘅本土嘅品味啦，嚇誒創作過程產生嘅樂趣啦？

293
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:19,000
誒嗰種觀感啦，同埋嗰個與佢認知嘅享受啊、渴望啊、追求啊呢種噉樣嘅觀察啊。

294
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,150
即係點樣可以指導一下？即係西九。

295
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:31,750
未來嘅嗰個發展嘅方向咧，或者咁問你好難答嘅，或者我聚焦兩點啦。

296
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:32,940
第一。

297
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:52,080
可能你哋都知道，即係有一班誒好有心嘅朋友，自從大概三個星期之前咧，已經係好主動、有系統地係去誒收集呢個雨傘運動嘅藝術品。

298
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:57,630
咁譬如西九有冇諗住？即係無論你嘅政見係點樣嚇。

299
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:14,110
梁振英當然個政見係唔同㗎啦，同雨傘廣場嘅人。咁但係呢一個噉嘅歷史嘅時刻咧，我相信一定，我好肯定會係喺中國同埋香港特區嘅歷史裏邊係一個重要嘅一個時刻。

300
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:26,620
西九有冇諗住咧，係將呢一啲藝術文化嘅創作，係作某一個程度嘅保留，啊嚟到去凝聚呢個歷史時空咧？

301
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:41,510
第二個問題咧，就係誒，有冇諗過？既然今次即係從實踐檢驗到個真理咧，就係其實你唔需要點樣多設計嘅嚇，即係你畀到個空間，你畀到個土壤。

302
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,960
其實。

303
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,140
香港人充滿創意。

304
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:51,070
噉你有冇諗過自由嘢？一年搞一次嘅啫，係嘛？阿馮總監。

305
01:05:51,500 --> 01:06:02,210
咁誒，即係呢個噉樣嘅觀察，有冇諗過點樣可以令佢發揮得更加淋漓盡致咧？主席。OK，誒，Mr. Lynch or

306
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,350
啊。

307
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:23,810
Thanks, Mr. Deputy Chairman. We haven't been approached as yet in any formal sense, but we're clearly aware, and it's you cannot not be aware of the range of activities that have been taking place around this building and the other parts of town. I guess our view is it's a little bit early to be looking.

308
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:43,820
看，知，呢個正式嘅角色，我們可能會有進一步嘅討論。但係，我們亦都會考慮，同其他嘅工作一樣，例如《香港王》嘅工作，或者其他嘅香港社區嘅工作。

309
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:57,950
consider you know who owns it, you know whether people are trying to donate it, look quite rigorously as whether it sits within the acquisition policies. I think on the issue of documentation, there's no question.

310
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:18,240
作為一個事件，這是一個高度documented事件，而且大家都知道。而且明顯，這會是未來某種方式反映在電影、電視或動畫中的。

311
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:38,250
collections, but at this point I think it's still too early to to start looking at that. I think the one point I would make, which I've made repeatedly over the last three and a half years, which I think is relevant to those critics who said Hong Kong is a cultural desert. No, I think clear.

312
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:52,970
Really, it's not. There are no huge involvement from the arts community in all sorts of activities. Some of it will eventually find its way into our museum, and some of it may well find its way onto the art market.

313
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:59,290
誒，因為時間關係咧，請大家都問答都精簡啲啦。喺何秀蘭議員。

314
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,680
係啊！唔該，主席。誒，確實咧，喺誒。

315
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:23,990
近呢兩個月咧，大家見到只要有空間咧，其實就有好多創意發揮到出嚟㗎啦。咁誒，就算係誒西九嗰個誒收誒收集藏品嗰個政策，暫時而家未去到民間呢個誒層面，但係我都希望西九管理局咧睇得到誒。

316
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:44,000
如果你係有一個空間，有一個時間畀大家咧，大家攞曬嗰啲誒創意嘅作品嚟咧，就已經係非常之豐盛喺誒樓下下角度咧，畀我哋最大嘅啟發咧，就係原來一個唔需要報名參加嘅誒展覽一個嘅場地咧，原來可以吸引到即係好。

317
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,670
好多好嘅人喺出嚟展示佢哋嘅創意，主席，我我其實咧我就想問呢個文件裏邊咧係。

318
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:55,060
就呢個資訊科技同埋多媒體嗰度咧。

319
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:15,490
係冇提及嘅咁誒，我睇到誒你哋喺培育人才啊，同埋其他活動嗰度咧，其實係做咗好多講座，亦都係誒有一啲誒表演嘅節目，或者係有一啲活動。噉我啱啱就上去西九管理局個網站度睇咧，就發覺多媒體嗰度咧。

320
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,460
其實就即係相比起你哋做過嘅活動咧。

321
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:39,750
比起上嚟咧，係相當不足夠，因為尤其是有一啲誒座談，譬如好似誒你文件第十三段B嗰度噉，Amplus思考係列嗰度噉，已經即係去到第七回啦。咁但係裏邊嘅一啲座談啊，或者係裏邊誒誒一啲藝術品。

322
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:59,760
誒攞嚟做參考嘅咧，噉我覺得呢啲誒研討會或者係座談都好，其實由頭到尾錄影曬放上去網嗰度咧，係可以讓更加多人係誒誒，第一佢未必係業內啦，未必受到你邀請啦，但係佢亦都係有個興趣誒去聽去。

323
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:17,110
睇呢啲政策，咁既然大家可以用咁多人力資源去準備一個實體嘅研討會，即係點解唔加多少少就將佢化為錄像，並且係擺上個網嗰度咧？即係就算唔係喺你自己。

324
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:37,460
嗰個網頁即係擺上YouTube嗰度咧，其實唔使即係唔使好多好多誒誒誒記憶體嘅錢嚇。呢個係即係一個好公共嘅誒集體嘅資訊空間，係絕對係可以擺到上去。即係除非你話嗰個版權有問題啦。我反為咧就見到有啲新聞發布咧，譬如。

325
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:57,470
嗰啲什麼什麼動土儀式咧，即係其實係除咗啊，棺蓋混集啊，大家影張相之外，實在對嗰個文化推動又唔係話太有幫助。咁西九你而家其實有幾多資源人力擺咗落去多媒體嘅記錄，甚至係。

326
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:09,740
發展推動誒運用多媒體呢一方面咧，人力係幾多，物力係幾多，同埋即係你係擺喺呢個誒邊個項目之下嘅咧？唔該，主席。好啊，請請教呢度。

327
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:30,030
I would take exception to your judgement. I think our website is probably now one of the best arts websites in the world, including the documentation of many of the events. And if you compare our website this year from our website last year, we have made extraordinary progress in.

328
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:50,040
Being able to document the events in a number of ways, with things like the neon sign exhibition, the seminars, that all of that material is available to be to be used, and we'll clearly see the dissemination of digital M plus will be a really big project that we're engaged.

329
01:11:50,040 --> 01:12:10,050
with at the moment the decade project on on the music and the film front and we will be using the website as a major part of the public communication of West Kalim. So we take on board some of your suggestions, but I think you're being a little harsh to us in terms of.

330
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:24,210
The progress that we have already made in terms of the use of the multimedia and and and the use of the digital space as part of the way of propagating.主席啊，我唔知道啊，係第二輪啦，係嘛？劉慧卿委員。

331
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,170
誒，多謝主席。

332
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,860
咁快cut我嘅，過曬鐘好耐啦。

333
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,030
我過咗卅秒到嘅啫喎。

334
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,240
點止？哦，劉慧卿委員。

335
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:36,980
啊，主席。

336
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,480
唉，呢個西狗咧～

337
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,900
真係咧！我相信真係搞多十幾二十年都未必。

338
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:48,340
即係未必有嘢睇嘅，真係，即係大家都好遺憾咯。

339
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,310
即係各方面嘅問題，即係多到咧，煩到不得了，主席。

340
01:12:53,590 --> 01:13:13,600
咁而當局咧係真係要努力啲去尋求立法會啊公眾嘅支持，令到啲嘢唔好咁爭議。如果唔係你嚟到立法會咧，係好難咧係獲得支持嘅。嗱，主席，我想再問清楚，而家高鐵嗰度咧就真係搞到一鍋泡啦。咁大家咧就講畀我哋聽。

341
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,330
聽咧就話完全冇影響第一二期嘅，係咪真係完全冇咧？

342
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:24,670
同埋呢個地庫嗰度咧，即係點解要咁大咁貴咧？

343
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:32,530
呢啲大家初初唔預期嘅喎，你又要節外生枝，咁嗰度如果唔批咧，個工程又做唔到。

344
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,410
咁點解要搞咁多麻煩咧，主席？

345
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,730
唔係我教佢。

346
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:40,580
係打一打嘛，你做啲。

347
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,390
沙中鮮補肉骨。

348
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,990
係。

349
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,470
do you do you want to go first?

350
01:13:47,120 --> 01:14:07,130
誒，哦好啊，工程係啊，劉議員誒，你剛才問關於呢個高鐵嗰個嘅影響咧，咁其實咧嗱，大家都喺呢度睇到咧，嗱呢一個咧就係西九嘅總站啦。咁其實咧，佢嘅工程咧就會入咗落去呢一個嘅範圍裏邊嘅，咁所以而家呢一個範圍咧，基本上咧都係呢個西鐵嗰個嘅誒。

351
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:27,140
工地嚟嘅噉，除咗呢一個範圍之外咧，另外呢一邊咧都係佢哋有一啲嘅誒，譬如係混凝土嘅誒嘅工地啊，佢哋嘅office啊噉。咁所以咧，其實喺呢一帶嘅地方嚟講咧，現階段咧係誒基本上都係畀呢一個誒西鐵嗰個嘅誒工作誒影響嘅。咁誒，我哋第一期咧。

352
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:47,150
我哋講緊嘅呢個戲曲中心咧，其實戲曲中心咧就誒而家嗰個階段嗰個嘅工作咧係唔會受到呢一個誒高鐵個影響。但係咧去到誒後尾即係近住係譬如一六一七嘅時候咧，其實我哋係需要同佢哋咧係配合喺出邊呢一個underpass嗰個嘅誒。

353
01:14:47,150 --> 01:15:07,160
誒嘅興建嘅，咁所以呢一個咧，我哋就要密切嘅同佢哋咧，大家要有一個嘅誒，即係有一個誒好好嘅聯繫啦。咁另外咧，我哋講翻咧就誒Batch One嘅誒Venue咧，其實誒譬如我哋講嘅Ample咧，其實誒喺而家嚟講咧，係基本上唔受到呢一個誒西鐵嗰個嘅工地嘅影響。

354
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:27,170
強嘅，你講高鐵係咪啊？誒誒，高鐵啊，sorry，誒高鐵嘅影響嘅。咁另外咧，呢一個嘅公園咧，誒原則上咧，我哋已經係完全係不受到呢一個高鐵嗰個影響嘅。噉啊，唯獨是咧，就去到呢一個演藝中心咧，其實喺呢一個南端嗰度咧，佢哋仍然需要咧一啲嘅地方咧，愛嚟做佢哋嗰個嘅誒。

355
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:47,180
誒誒運即係海運嘅誒工作嘅，咁所以呢一度咧就根據我哋現階段同佢哋傾咧，大約會係喺一六年尾到咧，佢就可以放翻出嚟嘅。咁而至於呢一個誒位置咧，就係誒我哋而家仍然咧係同佢喺度誒有一啲嘅商討啦。根據佢哋現階段嗰個嘅時間表咧，應該喺誒一七。

356
01:15:47,180 --> 01:16:04,850
七年開始咧，就會逐步噉樣樣係放翻出嚟嘅。咁當然呢個亦都要視乎咧呢個高鐵咧日後佢哋嗰個進展係點樣樣。噉我哋都係誒同佢哋保持有一個緊密嘅聯絡。咁希望佢哋可以咧按照而家我哋大家傾嗰個嘅時間表啦，係可以交還啲土地嘅嚇。

357
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:08,680
應該地庫咧？地庫個啊，房太。

358
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:29,750
我哋一早唔知道有咁大咁多錢要畀嘅。誒主席誒，根據即係Foster嘅design咧，即係個設計咧，就係所有嘅交通運輸系統咧，大部分都係要喺地庫，咁所以先至引致到我哋需要起一個大嘅地庫嚟到做一個接駁嘅誒系統。咁誒，但係其實我哋而家嚟。

359
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:44,080
立法會申請嘅撥款咧，亦都唔係單純係為咗地庫嘅，我哋亦都有一部分嘅錢咧係為西九文化區提供基建，而呢啲基建係誒政府係擁有嘅，咁所以呢個係兩個部分，我哋都需要嚟立法會呢度申請撥款。

360
01:16:44,360 --> 01:17:02,760
嗱，主席，我覺得佢嚟依度開會一定要要交代，亦都要同其他議員啊，要多啲溝通，多啲解釋，先至可以令到大家啲問題答得曬，可以支持你啲項目。如果唔係咧，真係慘啦！即係二十年啊，主席，可能二十年後啊，乜嘢都冇得睇啊！係好。

361
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:17,150
嗱，我哋第一輪就問曬㗎啦，第二輪有，因為我哋已經超咗時十五分鐘，咁睇下有冇誒同事咧要第二輪嘅答誒提問。舉咗手有陳婉嫻同埋何秀蘭，仲有冇其他同事？我畫一條線啦，好嘛？

362
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,130
如果冇嘅咧，我哋就呢兩位咧，每人咧就兩分鐘，好嘛？陳婉衡。

363
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:26,260
主席啊，我剛才嘅問問題咧，實係好清楚嘅。

364
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,920
就政府係未面對嘅。

365
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:43,850
即係話嗱，而家你因為你誒你嘅錢係可以使到第二期啊嘛，咁但係你當中咧而家地庫牽涉第二期裏邊都係係㗎嘛，咁但係而家你偏偏呢筆錢咧又擺咗樹嘅，即係當然仲有其他啲之前嘅講嘅錢咧。

366
01:17:44,130 --> 01:18:04,140
你而家睇到而家局面咧係好難，咁所以我就意思就話你點去面對？我剛才講政治問題，政治解決，即係呢個你需要成個政府諗嘅。但係問題就係現實問題，你冇嘅時候咧，噉你要諗辦法調動所有嘢。嗱，我想讀一段內容咧，佢就就講翻而家係李太嘅差總監需。

367
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:11,060
擔任協調政府各決策局、部門高層、西九管理局及其他相關各方嘅領導角色。

368
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:23,160
而呢個領導角色裏邊咧，再強調唔係淨係政府嘅，包括有細狗嘅。面對住噉嘅局面，你再畀阿連阿連生佢哋一路講，跟住個陳嘅陳生樹講，佢佢佢。

369
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:43,450
我覺得佢次嚟講嘅嘢咧，我哋好似傻傻地咁聽完講之後，跟住我哋發覺係去唔到嘅。鄭主席講就講啦，即係而家你咁打平睇，好似啊係喎，好好開心。二零二零有啦，二零二二年有啦，係冇㗎嘛。客官講係冇嘅，係去唔到嘅。就講跟住嚟嘅第二項目講要開兩個官員嘅。老實講，我同意嘅。

370
01:18:43,450 --> 01:19:03,460
即係上任做咗政策，上任係冇監管嘅西九。而家嚟到李太，我期望好高嘅。而我同佢合作喺喺九龍誒，即係東嗰邊咧。老實講，即係佢係有嗰定嘅責任心。上任就冇嘅。咁所以好啦，我就算我我同意咗，你嚟緊要我要去咩啊人事編制啊？你點？

371
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,440
點過咧？

372
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:16,270
即係我覺得整會諗啲嘢先得嘅，例如你話我我即刻諗啦，呢啲錢説使緊，你剛才講嘅每日每個月都使緊嚟錢嘅，而使緊錢嘅時候，你點樣用嗰啲嘢填翻而家個損失咧？

373
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:36,630
即係我覺得官員就要一個應變先得。如果你再畀連三一路走去咁講講講講講講到我都唔知即係幾多主席，我一講簡單就話你而家你嗰個碼頭啊，如果剛才陳志全講問題，而家你碼頭將提前要做，你本身解決咗，你未來我唔知你幾時啊？劉慶講啊，二十年都唔知得唔得咧，真係。

374
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:49,340
有可能，我諗我哋專題講，所以我就覺得你而家面對住噉嘅狀況，你政府有應變計劃，有B計劃上先得㗎嘛？冇嚟睇天而嚇，聽天而行嘅點得啫？好多謝你哋發表嘅意見。

375
01:19:50,490 --> 01:20:10,500
你你仲有咩問題？答我㗎，佢喺呢part答唔到，我下part第二節嘅環節，我都要嚟再問翻問題啊。咁咧誒，交通嗰啲咧，而家冇時間詳細答。唔係講交通，我講緊你睇講政府部門嘅角色面對而家政治上噉嘅劇變咧，我哋立法會嘅不合作咧，你點去處理翻咧？唔該，主席。秘書長答一答。

376
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:30,510
誒，你有咩應變措施？O.K.，大家正正如我頭先答過好多次咧，我哋唔係唔知道而家嗰個問題，我哋係知道，我哋都好著緊係同西九管理局嘅誒，即係同事同埋亦都我哋自己董事局咧，我哋都喺度研究呢個問題。我哋誒希望下一次嘅董事局咧，我哋都會將呢個問題提交畀董事。

377
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:50,520
局去考慮咁有一啲嘅方案，而家我哋傾緊，但係我哋而家係未成熟，唔能夠喺今日呢個會議度向啊議員去交代。但係我哋一承諾一定會翻嚟呢度咧，係諮詢大家。我哋無論點樣做法，頭先議員提過一啲嘅方法係咪可行嘅咧？我哋都係會考慮嘅。咁至於長遠嚟講，成個地庫嗰個工程嘅價個造價或者係價錢，

378
01:20:50,520 --> 01:21:09,410
點樣咧？我哋亦都會係喺唔同嘅方案咧，睇下可唔可以盡量壓低嗰個嘅造價嘅價錢，同埋係誒，即係就算係用到西九自己嘅資源去調配咧，呢個亦都有誒影響嘅。即係自己，因為如果佢用咗喺呢度嘅第啲地方係少錢，係咪牽涉到再要注資呢啲問題咧？我哋都係要全盤去考慮嚇。阿何秀蘭。

379
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:29,710
嗱，主席，我唔介意同時超時，因為我覺得兩分鐘唔夠，兩分鐘變咗三分四十五秒。不過你一視同仁啊，得㗎啦。嗱，頭先咧就阿連生就未答我嘅嗰個誒多媒體嗰度咧，你究竟有幾多人、幾多資源擺咗落去？你係將呢啲定多媒體嘅開支？

380
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:49,720
係擺入去邊個項目？頭先就大連生就話我 harsh啦嚴苛嚇，咁其實咧就相對於即係其他嘅政府部門咧，確實你嗰度已經係多咗多媒體，但係對一個即係專職去推動文化政策嘅部門咧，就

381
01:21:49,720 --> 01:22:09,730
真係上多個即係錄影錄像啊！噉我唔知阿連生上次幾時上你自己網頁啦。即係譬如好似誒一個關於誒戲曲嘅座談會都係得上，而唔係即係有錄像喺度。噉我覺得對嗰個座談會嘅舉行係一個浪費，因為你即係要增加多少少嘢。

382
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:18,000
你就可以將嗰一個活動嘅價值，即係其實係提高咗好多。噉啊，請阿連生答啦。好啊，阿連連生，你。

383
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:38,530
巴打。嗯，Well no, I guess what I said, I thought your comments were harsh in regard to your assessment of our website. I think I've looked at many thousands of websites, particularly in Hong Kong and in other places, and the work we've put into our website and a substantial investment of funds is clearly.

384
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:58,540
and the fact that it is now in, you know, it's one of the best bilingual or trilingual websites in regard to an arts organisation that you can find anywhere. Clearly, we have resources working to expand both the education, the learning side of what we're doing. Maybe let us focus on the.

385
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:18,550
video recording on the event that took place instead of the entire website in general. Well, we've got, we will be able to provide all of the things that we actually undertake. We'll be able to upload them to the websites, and clearly that's the intention that events that

386
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:38,560
We do clearly the issue of performance is still until we start producing performances ourselves and the copyright issues are grappled with. We're not able to put Cantonese operas up there that don't belong to us, but we are looking at using our website to facilitate audience development.

387
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:58,570
The whole idea of the Rising Stars project is very much to be able to disseminate the work that comes out of that project. All of our projects, whether they're Free Space, we've taken substantial video footage which will be uploaded to the website of the performances, and we'll.

388
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:18,580
Continue to do that because we think it's the best way of building the support from the local community and the broader community in terms of what we're doing. But you owe me an answer on how much the resources and how many persons. Well, I can't give you the specific. I've got ten people working on the digital.

389
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:38,590
Side of our organisation, clearly, I'm very happy at some further point to brief you on our plans in terms of communications, marketing, and the development of things like digital M plus, a number of other specific initiatives, which I think will be very much answers to some of your.

390
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:58,600
我諗你會後提供多啲資料畀阿何議員啦，好嘛？咁誒，今日咧我哋就完成咗呢個議程，但係當然有好多問題，大家都唔滿意，或者係好大疑問，好似地庫啊、交通啊、啊電影啊，就算甚至係收藏作品呢啲等等咧，我哋之後咧會。

391
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:07,510
會再逐個item咧，依啲分類咧，再同佢詳細咧，我哋喺度再討論嘅，好冇？噉我哋下一個議程咧，就係。

392
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:10,110
關於依個誒。

393
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,540
建議。

394
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:27,110
以前三建議呢個西九文化區延長一個首席嘅政府工程師同埋一個首長級頂級嘅政務官嘅編內職位嘅，噉啊文件C.B.C.U.二三零六十四至十五。

395
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,500
括弧零四至零五文件嘅，我請誒。

396
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:50,790
誒啊，秘書長咧就介紹個文件，噉我哋多謝西九嘅同事出咗啦嚇。多謝主席，或者我簡單咁講講呢個文件啦。我哋建議咧喺民政事務局裏邊咧係延長一個嘅首席政府工程師係首長級第三級嘅職位，同埋一個首長級丙級政務官就係第二首長級第二級嘅。

397
01:25:50,790 --> 01:26:10,800
偏外嘅職位係維期四年嘅，就繼續監察同埋協調咧西九文化區嘅計劃嘅推行。呢兩個首長級嘅職位咧，其實首次咧喺二零一零年七月咧係誒開設咗嘅。咁咧係到出年嘅三月三十一號咧就係誒終止㗎啦。咁而家因為西九嗰個嘅設施嘅發展。

398
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:30,810
啊！籌劃啊興建啊，以至文化軟件咧，個個工作咧都係進行得如火如荼。咁亦都頭先，我哋喺上一個議程度咧都介紹咗啦。喺一五至到一九年咧，將會陸續咧有多項嘅設施咧係落成啟用。咁誒，亦都係誒需要咧係緊密噉樣樣咧，同有關嘅政府部門啦嚟到去溝。

399
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:50,820
溝通啦，協調有關嘅誒基建啊、基建設施啊，同埋係誒攞到一啲嘅規劃嘅批准啊等等。噉，所以我哋希望呢兩個嘅職位咧，都能夠係延長四年咧，由一五年四月一號咧去到一九年嘅三月三十一號嘅。咁誒工程總監呢個職位咧，就係而家係阿李太係誒做緊啦，就係負責監察。

400
01:26:50,820 --> 01:27:10,830
西九各項工程嘅進度協調同埋統籌有關嘅政府部門，其中一個重要嘅工作咧就係推展頭先我哋提經常提到嘅綜合地庫，同埋係支援西九共用同埋政府設施嘅發展，亦都咧係需要為呢啲設施工程設施咧嚟到財委會嗰度咧係申請撥款嘅。咁至於首長級誒首席助理被。

401
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:30,840
秘書長嘅職位咧，就係誒負責監察管理局嘅工作係咪有根據有關嘅法例咧嚟到進行咧，保障公共資源得以妥善嘅運用，同埋確保管理局嘅運作係具問責性同埋透明度嘅。咁誒首席助理秘書長咧，亦都咧要係確保咧誒管理局咧同其他有關嘅團體誒。

402
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:50,850
持份者咧係充分嘅溝通啦，喺佢哋制定誒藝術嘅定位啊、管治模式啊、管理嘅安排咧，都要考慮到其他持份者嘅意見，同埋亦都咧係同其他文化藝術設施咧係配合誒，達到咧協同嘅效應。咁如果得到誒小組委員會嘅支持咧，我哋會向人力事務委員會咧喺個誒徵詢佢。

403
01:27:50,850 --> 01:28:04,040
佢哋嘅意見，然後咧係尋求財委會嘅批准嘅。咁有關嘅詳細嘅情況咧，都喺文件嗰度交代咗啦。多謝主席。好啊，各位提誒，同事有冇提問咧？對於支持呢個誒延長呢兩個職位？

404
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:06,690
誒舉咗手有啊陳遠霞。

405
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:09,090
劉慧卿啊，陳展鵬先。

406
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:13,840
係主席，我剛才咧係我剛才講咗咧，我支持嘅。

407
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:23,270
因為咧，實際我喺過去喺西九咧，好多時揾西九傾咧嚇，噉就好多時誒列席嗰個代表住民政嘅官員咧。

408
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:43,660
成個大配角冇嘢講嘅，我唔知係咪因為佢職能強，我再睇翻而家佢職能咧好強嘅喎。咁所以，我剛才就提一紮問題咧。我點解要強調咧？就係而家西九去到噉嘅狀況咧，我覺得面對而家噉嘅狀立法會嘅情況或者社會嘅情況咧，政府要喺個施政上要攞啲辦法出。

409
01:28:43,660 --> 01:29:03,670
出嚟唔係喺樹等喺樹遮一日嗰日噉樣唔得嘅嗱，我支持呢兩位嘅進格，兩位我對印象都好嘅。但係問題即係肯做嘢人啦，肯推進啦，喺度肯推動啦。但係問題咧，你解決到嘅嘛？就算我而家支持你，而家你正會面對住包括埋我哋嘅人事編制過唔過到咧？我真係驚。

410
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:13,560
好難啦，即係呢個努力咧，大家噉啊好啦。我當咗就算係噉樣掂咗，你點去真係履行翻年內你民政喺西九角色咧？

411
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,190
我一直問緊好多人，我不過問咗林太係點去履行緊政府角色。

412
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:39,480
即係嗱，例如好似剛才講，佢畀個文件話咁培養人才，我哋都同意嘅。但係你知唔知佢而家未來嘅發展將要有大批管理嘅嗰個管理？如果以而家狀況就三個三個咁加落去，咁足唔足夠將來更多場地去管理咧？特別而家香港，我哋後生仔好多新嘅構思喺構。

413
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:59,490
之下有冇更多呢啲人才幫翻佢哋咧？又例如你哋對於成個西九而家既有嘅現有嗰啲研究之外咧，可唔可以有啲嘢畀啲年輕人參與咧？嗱，例如等等啊，都唔係唔係西九去諗掂去㗎嘛，係政府去處理而家新嘅局面下，佢點樣處理咧？咁所以覺得就係話我支持增加。

414
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:16,050
兩個官員，不過如果以政府而家政策，假如咩都唔喐咧，第一個等立法會啦，第二個咧好多嘢咧，你仍然嚇，即係你唔給予個權力重新去去去安排好咧，最後你都係由於成個西九佢現有嘅班子咧，佢好強嘅嘛，佢今日唔到你嚟㗎。

415
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:36,640
即係特別嗰陣坐住個陳嘅總工程師，佢經常好多時你講完曬之後，佢啲啱嘅，我仍然照翻去支教冇意思嘅，因為我做過好多次好多次，即係由低温佢又喺度跟呢件事跟到而家，好多時令到自己幾hurt㗎。咁所以我就想話主席，我支持政策嘅，我連係問咗一紮問題，政府你要答談我先得，有冇決心去處理而家嘅問題？

416
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:56,650
有決心喺將來履行呢個職位，去做好呢個監管工作，唔係吊吊飛咁畀由西九啲誒噉，畀我哋感覺就係咯。嗯，好，阿馮太打打係誒，主席多謝阿陳議員，佢對西九係好關心，亦都係好誒，畀咗好多好多意見。我哋嘅過去一段時間咁誒，當然即係西九管理局佢自己係一個獨立。

417
01:30:56,650 --> 01:31:16,660
嘅法人啦，係一個獨立嘅團體，但係佢唔好忘記佢嘅主席而家仲係政務司司長噉，亦都我哋成個民政局咧係有一個好強嘅一個嘅監察，同埋係誒即係誒喺政策上面亦都要畀一個主導佢哋嘅。咁西九作為嗰個管理局咧，當然佢要配合成個政府嘅文化發展嘅政策啦。但係當然西

418
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:36,670
西九自己亦都有一個好強嘅誒團隊，專業嘅團隊，佢亦都可以咧係畀好多意見誒喺成個文化政策上面，有冇一啲嘢係可以改動嘅、扭鬆嘅嚟到係畀我哋去考慮。咁所以其實我哋同西九咧，民政局同埋西九管理局咧係一個好互動嘅關係。而家亦都已經係發展。不過誒誒，我想話上邊咧，我唔係。

419
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:52,660
阻你，我不過想問你明我先得。你咁講係冇意思嘅，即係我意思話點樣令到新嘅批官員我當咗順入再做啦，或者而家都做緊咧？點樣令到佢哋真能夠發揮你原來嘅職能咧？我抄曬職能喺書㗎，唔錯㗎。

420
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,150
係做唔到嘅。

421
01:31:54,430 --> 01:32:04,500
次次我講又冇嘢做唔到，我就舉個例，碼頭點樣咧？泊車場我哋點咧？講實好多規劃我帶埋工程師，帶埋文化界嚟，係冇意思嘅次次。

422
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:08,150
即係我覺得我講完要對住空氣，噉我覺得冇意思㗎。

423
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:28,560
我就覺得應該要本身你做監察緊你進度嘅官員係有責任處理㗎嘛係誒，或者好簡單噉樣答啦。就誒，當然即係政府我哋嘅監察嘅角色喺度嘅。阿李太其實佢一個好勤力嘅官員啦，佢誒成日都會同唔同嘅部門去開會，亦都係即係捉住西九嘅同事去開會。咁但係西九而家有一個嘅誒。

424
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:48,570
改變就係佢哋自己，亦都咧聘請咗一個營運嘅總監嚟到去統籌所有工程上面嘅工作。咁同我哋咧係有一個誒，而家係比較好嘅一個嘅誒溝通同埋協調嘅。我哋每一個月都有誒例會咧，同佢哋去去開會去追嗰個嘅進度。噉我希望誒阿陳議員喺嚟緊呢半年度咧會睇到一啲比較誒。

425
01:32:48,570 --> 01:33:08,580
反應快啲啊，同埋有有有回應嘅一啲嘅反應，係西九管理局嗰方面畀到你。咁但係呢個就係啊總監咧，佢需要喺嚟嘅呢個時間咧，佢更加係誒追翻啲進度。有啲遲咗嘅，我哋會追；有啲係應應承咗要做嘅，亦都要喺嗰段適當嘅時間係要即係交交向各位去交代翻呢個進度。O K，好。

426
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,040
阿偉，阿劉偉。

427
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:17,550
啊，主席啊，其實啊，陳婉嫺議員頭先講嗰啲問題咧，即係都係好嚴肅問題咯。

428
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:37,920
即係猛咁要畀使錢去加位或者去延續啲位，但係有啲遲瞓者咧，你哋嗰個係咪有個諮詢委員會？佢哋有啲直就話要解散，佢哋好多個都係業界嘅，亦都好唔開心。大家都做到噉樣，我哋喺呢度又見唔到啲工程有進度嚇，即係。

429
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:57,930
真係我頭先都講啦，係未十幾二十年都未曾有嘢睇，噉你又猛咁要要再使多啲錢落去去加人，你要畀立法會覺得真係做到嘢，甚至你同議員嘅溝通去解釋你哋嗰啲嘢，去尋求支持呢方面都做得唔足夠啦，噉你自己個。

430
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:17,940
班咩諮詢委員會又係搞到個個都即係好多個都好唔開心。噉你哋有冇明白到即係點嘅啫？有啲又話：，誒個管理局嗰度又自己喺度搞，又唔係好同政府有有合作。呢個港鐵又關人啦嚇，好多嘢都費事理你哋。即係唉咁搞法啊！你又走嚟要攞咁多錢。

431
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:37,140
即係大家點可以支持咧？其實你西九嘅項目，人哋支持咗你好多年㗎啦，搞到今時今日，完全係裹足不前。即係你話阿司長，司長而家邊有時間你啊？佢嗰次嚟仲話好似話想唔做主席添。唉，搞到噉樣係咪即係要爛尾收場咧？

432
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:58,420
係啊，誒，李書長誒，多謝劉議員嘅提問。其實誒，我哋新一屆嘅董事局咧，就剛剛喺十月咧係誒，即係委任咗啦。噉我哋都會喺嚟緊十月咧開第一次嘅董事局。咁呢一個嘅新嘅董事局，可能咧佢哋會對西九嗰個嘅發展咧，會有一啲新嘅意見啦。同埋頭先阿議員提到嗰個諮詢。

433
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:18,430
委員會咧喺誒上一次呢個小組委員會討論完之後咧，其實佢哋都開咗會，咁亦都司長好誒啊主席啦，即係西九管理局主席，亦都係司長咧，就係親自去開咗會，亦都係希望咧呢一個嘅諮詢委員會能夠發揮更大嘅作用，特別係就住西九同年青人同埋一啲持份者嗰個嘅關係咧係。

434
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:38,440
採納佢哋意見呢度咧，要大力度咁做多啲功夫嘅。咁而家諮詢委員會都喺嚟緊呢個日子裏邊咧，佢哋會更積極噉樣樣咧，向翻西九咧係去提意見嘅。咁誒，至於頭先議員提到話誒，我哋作為即係民政局啦，同埋西九亦都多啲需要向議員去解釋我哋嘅工作。咁呢個我係絕對同意嘅。喺誒。

435
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:58,450
誒，我哋無論喺會食誒會議上面，或者喺會議以外咧，我哋都應該多啲咧，係同議員咧去解釋。而家我哋成個工程嗰個進度困難點喺邊一度？咁呢一個日後嘅日子咧，我哋誒呢個民政事務局嘅團隊咧，誒會聯同西九一齊咧去做多啲呢方面嘅功夫嘅。阿主席啊，嗰董事局啱啱委任。

436
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:07,570
我哋都冇資料啊，係咪啊？冇啊，我自己都冇。喂，有冇搞錯啊？今日嚟開會都唔畀嗰啲資料我哋，即係咩嘢咩事嚟㗎？你哋？

437
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:27,860
誒，我哋可以喺會後交。我哋其實係喺出咗新聞稿。新聞稿啊，你可唔可以畀一份我哋秘書？你知唔知我哋有個委員會喺度㗎？餵！你真係，我覺得真係好過分。而家我又睇唔到嗰啲新聞喎，主席，我都唔知你真係委任咗嚇。好公平。唉，真係咁甩碌咁做嘢法，你真係你委任。

438
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:47,870
因為嗰個局係重要㗎嘛，幫你睇住，噉你都唔需要話畀呢個委員會聽邊啲人係做，喺度新去做係點樣做法。喂，阿秘書長，你係咪真係噉樣做事㗎？誒，有幾多新人有幾多舊人啊？個委員會，誒，我哋可以稍後畀翻嗰個嘅會議嘅嗰個委員新一屆嘅董事局嘅成。

439
01:36:47,870 --> 01:37:05,260
畀議員嘅嚇，阿主席你知唔知啊？我唔知，我諗。喂，你要做主席你都唔知啊！真係，真係好心你哋當局，你唔可以噉樣對我哋呢個委員會啦。噉我諗你盡快啦，同埋你嗰啲新委員會都唔好一年開一兩次啦。如果一年開兩次開個茶會就算啦，係嘛？

440
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,470
咁下一個誒副主席。

441
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:29,560
嗱，其實個董事局換咗幾多人咧？可唔可以講講咧？你唔需要講名嘅嚇，即係可能我哋聚過啦，冇睇你嗰啲即係政府嘅新聞公佈啦，係嘛？但係即係可我我希望阿馮太唔會對我哋太苛刻咧。我哋每日睇嘅文件實多到不得了，汗牛充棟嚇。

442
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:38,880
即係誒，改咗幾換咗幾多人？陣間你可以略為講一講啦。我就係知道我哋嘅同事馬逢國就獲得再次委任啦。頭先佢自己講嘅嚇。

443
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:59,380
嗱，其實我我睇翻咧嗰個誒立法會，即係上次開呢兩個偏外職位嘅時候咧，就最主要就啲誒同事咧就住誒首席政府工程師嗰個位咧，就話係咪一定要工程人員咧？即係係咪即係？

444
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,560
建築師都可以考慮咧，噉。

445
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:17,240
噉就誒，或者一間誒啊啊啊，李太係咪？你都係自己講下啫。你做咗誒第一段時間啦，噉你覺得點咧？咁噉，我哋都得個支持都好嘅。

446
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:21,250
咁但係至於誒呢個首長。

447
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:28,420
助理秘首席助理秘書長呢個職位咧，我諗羅忠女士都可以講講，即係你嗰個。

448
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:48,850
經驗啦，因為咧，我相信頭先譬如陳宇駿議員佢嘅問咧，都係一直以嚟誒本會嘅一啲關注啊，即係應該咧就係呢個首長級嘅丙級政務官咧，就係即係政府同西九管理局嘅橋梁啊嘛，之間嘅橋梁係嘛，即係最簡單嚟講係因為。

449
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:49,900
噉樣理解啊！

450
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:54,070
咁呢個橋梁其實係輸送緊啲咩嘢嘅咧？

451
01:38:54,490 --> 01:39:14,500
即係由局去政府，由政府翻去局，係有啲咩實際嘅嘢係誒經過啊？羅女士，你喺呢個職位上面係發揮嗰個橋梁嘅角色嘅咧，噉我都想即係知道一下。O K，多謝主席。或者主席，我答咗第一個問題先啦，就誒。

452
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:34,510
誒西九管理局嘅新一屆嘅誒董事局咧，喺十月二十三號咧就係誒任期係開始嘅。我哋誒誒政府咧係委任翻八位嘅誒現有嘅成員咧，作為呢一個嘅誒董事局成員。另外咧係加入咗六位新嘅成員嘅。咁誒名字方面咧，我誒稍後會畀翻委員會。

453
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:38,350
好，其其他同事，另外兩位同事或者啲志願，有冇補充？

454
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:58,970
誒至於你誒另外一個問題問咧，就係誒係咪一定要工程師先可以做啲嘅位置誒建築師得唔得咧？咁其實係可以嘅。咁咧，其實最緊要咧就係誒，無論邊一個人選咧，就係佢要喺過往嘅經驗裏邊咧，曾經係處理過啲較為大型嘅一啲嘅誒基建嘅項目。咁因為咧係。

455
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:14,170
喺誒呢個西九誒文化區咧，佢裏邊咧唔單止咧係有好多唔同嘅building啦，另外咧就係佢同周邊嗰一啲嘅工程咧有一個好密切嘅關係，咁所以咧只需要咧誒嗰個人選係有呢一方面嘅經驗咧，其實都可以應付得到嘅。

456
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:34,480
好啊！阿羅小姐，想唔想？想唔想答？咁但係你你過去嗰段時間，即係你唔覺得，因為係工程師而有任何嘅即係欠缺啦，係咪一定？即係因為因為因為我睇翻歷史文文獻嘅啫，我唔係質疑你嘅你嘅工作表現啊！你睇可以問你明白，因為我哋一直討論咧，就話。

457
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:40,620
啊，會唔會建築師會好啲啊？噉樣噉，所以我聽下你即係作為第一新嘅經歷啫。

458
01:40:40,920 --> 01:41:00,930
誒，因為可能過往咧，我喺誒啟德嗰度都做咗一段日子嘅。咁喺啟德誒，其實嗰個情況係同呢度係差唔多。咁誒，而且咧，我下邊咧亦都有誒建築師係support我㗎。咁所以誒，喺現階段嚟講，我覺得暫時我睇唔到有啲太大嘅困難。多謝我，我請阿羅啊，劉小姐。

459
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:20,940
多謝主席。誒，其實西九管理局佢自己都已經有一個哦，即係一定數目嘅專業團隊啦，有有豐富文化藝術方面嘅經驗嘅。而我哋喺民政事務局咧，就會覺得需要一個有公豐富公共行政經驗嘅同事咧，去做作為政府同埋西九管理局嘅橋梁。咁誒，我自己本人咧就啊～

460
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:40,950
會係會坐西九裡面嘅行政委員會啦，佢嘅博物館委員會啦，誒表演藝術委員會啦，誒同埋誒薪酬委員會嘅。噉我哋嘅角色咧就係誒誒去監察翻西九管理局喺佢誒使用公帑方面啦，喺佢嘅企業管治方面啦，同埋佢要係喺各樣運作。

461
01:41:40,950 --> 01:42:00,960
方面咧都要符合翻西九管理局嗰個哦條例方面嘅要求，噉就誒變咗，我哋就會覺得唔需要一定要由一個我本身係出自文化藝術界嘅人去擔任，反而係即係我哋政務官嘅同事喺過往唔同嘅崗位上面咧都累積咗一啲啲誒公共行政嘅經驗咧，可以幫到我。

462
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:20,970
好，政府喺監察式誒西九個個計劃嘅進度方面，可以而發揮作用咧。嗱，主席頭先我我唔知要排第二輪啦，不過你你揸第二輪嘅啦，已經係哦好啊。噉我我頭先我問喺第一輪啫，我哋冇二輪喺嗰個橋樑上邊咧，嗰種來往啊嘅交通係可唔可以具體講講係啲咩嘢嚟？

463
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:21,350
係。

464
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:32,170
嗰種來往，多謝主席。誒，就唔可以好難量化嘅。噉我頭先數咗一啲委員，唔係量化，即係啊，主席唔好意思，即係我想即係知道嗰個性質係咩嘢。

465
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:52,210
即係頭頭先，頭先啊羅女士就解釋咗，即係佢會參加嗰四個小組嘅會啦嚇。噉佢就係愛嚟，即係確保咧，即係西九管理局呢幾個會咧，係唔會越權啊，係即係知所恆止啊噉樣啊。我明白啦，呢個角色。咁但係即係你係。

466
01:42:52,530 --> 01:43:00,070
雙向啊嘛，嗰條橋梁，咁咁有啲咩帶去政府嗰度㗎？政府有啲咩會通過你係帶去局嗰度㗎？

467
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:20,360
誒，譬如咁講話啊，以表演藝術誒嘅場地為例啦。咁誒西九嘅團隊去計劃佢嘅誒表演藝術場地嘅誒將來嘅定位啊、運作模式啊。噉我哋喺民政事務局都起個橋樑誒嘅角色咧，就係將文誒康文署嘅經驗，咪都帶翻去西九，我去。

468
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:40,370
即係互相去交流，將來實際喺西九好上面點樣落實咧？噉我覺得咧，我哋政府方面嘅經驗當然唔係話西九西九當然唔係要跟政府嗰套啦，但係我哋過往實質運作嘅經驗都可以幫到佢哋咯。我最後問埋呢樣嘢，即係譬如連立志先生啊，佢想。

469
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:50,190
同阿主席，即係林鄭月娥司長去講一個意見。佢係透過你轉達啦，亦或佢直接打個電話畀林鄭嘅咧？

470
01:43:51,250 --> 01:44:11,260
我答啦，就誒作為西九管理局嘅主席咧，政務司司長係有定期嘅誒溝通嘅渠道，同啊誒西九管理局嘅行政總裁同埋佢哋嘅一啲總重要嘅委員會嘅主席嘅，佢有直接嘅溝通渠道。但係因為實在西九嘅工作實在太多，咁所以我哋每一日咧，其實我哋四個咧。

471
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:21,400
都係同緊西九咧喺度有一個溝通，係有啲嘢我哋需要講畀佢聽，或者佢有啲嘢想通過我哋咧去徵詢主席啊，或者係其他部門嘅意見。咁呢個係我哋嘅工作嚟嘅。
