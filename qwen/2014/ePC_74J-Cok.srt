1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,080
立法會主席。

2
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,550
各位早晨。

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,550
誒為咗。

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,240
誒早一啲，讓議員誒知道做準備咧。

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,430
就我決定。

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:49,720
將我哋本來呢次會議議程上邊嘅兩項無立法效力嘅議員議案咧，係留到喺我哋三月十九號嘅會議上邊先至處理。

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,980
即使話咧，我哋呢次。

8
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,090
會咧喺完成咗而家呢一個條例草案之後，就仲有兩個。

9
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,270
誒議員議案係誒。

10
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,470
要要處理嘅。

11
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,980
之外咧。

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,080
兩項無立法效力嘅議員議案咧，我哋係會留翻三月十九號嘅會。

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,710
我哋而家咧係喺。

14
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,030
嗯。

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,800
我哋嘅講稿嘅第七十四頁。

16
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,420
第十七條。

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,210
運輸及房屋局局長已經作出預告。

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,410
同以再列喺講稿附錄一嘅佢嘅第四項嘅修正案，修正第十七條。

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,650
就建議嘅第七十條第括弧二款作技術性嘅修訂。

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:56,010
郭榮亨議員咧亦都已經作出預告，係動議再列喺我哋嘅講稿附錄一嘅佢嘅第二項修正案，修正第十七條喺建議嘅第七十條加入。

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,390
括弧四款。

22
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:05,250
豁免為未成年人購買住宅物業繳納買家印花税。

23
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:26,260
李慧瓊議員咧已經作出預告，動議再列喺我哋講稿附錄一嘅佢嘅第四至第七項嘅修正案，修正第十七條嘅噉啊。李慧瓊議員嘅第四至第七項嘅修正案咧，都係為徵收額外印花税及買家印花税嘅相關條文。

24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,400
訂立停止生效嘅日期嘅。

25
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,570
全委會咧係會先表決。

26
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
喺負六一嘅。

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:50,410
運輸及房屋局局長嘅第四項修正案，咁不論局長嘅第四項修正案是否獲得通過咧，都唔會影響郭榮亨議員動議佢嘅第二項修正案，或者李慧瓊議員動議佢嘅第四至第七項修正案嘅。

28
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,710
亦都不論郭榮亨議員嘅第二項修正案是否獲得通過咧，李慧瓊議員都可以同意佢嘅第四至第七項修正案。

29
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:08,070
咁如果郭榮亨議員嘅修正案獲得通過咧，我已經批准咗李慧瓊議員修改佢就第十七條提出嘅修正案㗎啦。

30
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,880
如果你為《憲議員》嘅第四項修正案獲得通過咧，佢就不可以動議佢第五項修正案。

31
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:24,690
但係不論佢嘅第四或者第五項修正案是否通過咧，李慧瓊議員都可以動議第六項修正案。

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:34,500
但如果第四項或者第五項修正，我覺得通過，我亦都已經批准咗李慧瓊議員修改佢嘅第六及第七項嘅修正案。

33
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,770
最後咧，如果李慧瓊議員嘅第六項修正案獲得通過咧，佢就唔可以同意佢第七項嘅修正案。

34
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,250
啲大家記唔記得上面所講嘅嘢？

35
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,600
各位委員就可以就第十七條嘅原文。

36
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:06,560
以及就該條文提出嘅修正案進行合並辯論。噉我先請局長發言，以及動議修正案，然後再請郭榮亨議員同李慧瓊議員依次發言。但係呢，佢哋暫不可動議修正案。

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,570
局長。

38
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,640
主席，我動議，再列於講稿附錄一，我嘅第四項修正案。

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,880
已修正第十七條。

40
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,850
有關嘅修正案係技術性嘅修訂。

41
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:30,740
有關嘅修訂並唔會對條例草案裏邊嘅內容造成任何實質嘅改變。

42
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,590
政府提出嘅修正案。

43
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,860
主要係清楚説明。

44
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,590
倘若應繳付加強後嘅額外印花税嘅文書。

45
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,690
已經按照現行條例繳交舊有嘅額外印花税。

46
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:59,370
但係預期未繳付新舊額外印花税嘅差額嘅時候，税務局係只可以就呢個差額係去徵收罰款。

47
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:09,350
我理解郭榮亨議員同埋李慧瓊議員提建議，就條例草案第十七條係提出修正案。

48
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:19,100
政府係不能同意有關嘅修正案嘅，但係我會喺聆聽誒各位議員嘅發言之後，先作詳細嘅回應。多謝主席。

49
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,520
郭榮亨議。

50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,920
Good morning, Mr. President.

51
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:35,590
在我的演辭 earlier yesterday，我已解釋， in full， 我的原因 for putting forward， the present， CSA。

52
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:49,330
shall I shall not waste time in repeating in full my reason for doing so in my arguments behind the CSA, but suffice to do, I suffice to do.

53
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,100
That we are to refer to the central principle.

54
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,730
在 our rule of law and our legal system, which is that of certainty.

55
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,040
啊！

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:21,330
I believe that this is not a principle which is new to us, nor is it something that we are making up in order to support the CSA. Certainty is a principle that is central to our system of rule of law, and I shall repeat briefly what the chief

57
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:40,610
Justice, the former Chief Justice said in the quarterfinal appeal judgment of Solicitor versus Law Society of Hong Kong, certainty in the law and predictability and consistency in its application are of great importance. They provide the foundation for the orderly conduct of commercial business and other activities.

58
00:06:41,450 --> 00:07:01,460
That is why we believe that the CSA, as proposed by me, is cardinal to ensuring that there shall be consistency and orderly conduct of commercial transaction, especially when it comes to the acquisition of properties, which this bill this bill deals.

59
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,960
with。

60
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,090
Now may I begin with the crux of the matter, because

61
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:26,530
The reason why we are facing the present dilemma stems from the way this bill was drafted, and in particular, section 1, subsection 2, which states that this ordinance is deemed to have come into operation on the 27th of October 2012. Now, this very provision.

62
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,090
is extremely unusual. It's unusual because no bill.

63
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
No bill would have the.

64
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:50,280
Operation date very rarely stated retrospectively from the 27th of October 2012, meaning more almost two years from the date.

65
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,830
when it comes into operation, almost 18 months.

66
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:05,370
The reason why we are in the present dilemma is because the way this bill is proposed, it is unusual because it is not a subsidiary legislation.

67
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,940
但係，它 takes the form in effect in effect。

68
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:16,290
of negative vetting, it comes into operation immediately, without any legislative scrutiny.

69
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:26,780
and we pretend that this is a blue bill. In the secretary' response yesterday, he said, well, you can't.

70
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,900
take up the blue bill.

71
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:48,250
and pretend that every provision in the bill will come into passing at the end of the day because this is only a blue bill, so no one, including lawyers, can treat every provision, including the exemptions, as being the law of the day.

72
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,740
因為它 may not be passed by the legislative council at the end of the day. True.

73
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:14,050
But in the usual course of matters, that is of course true. No one will run around and say holding a blue bill saying this will be law, so we better act in accordance with it. But the unusual feature of this blue bill, as I've pointed out, lies in section one, sub section two. It comes into operation immedi.

74
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,740
立即。

75
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,850
and it acts.

76
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:36,400
In effect, as a negative fetting, although you don't call it negative fetting, but what's in the name, as Shakespeare said, that which we call rose by any other word would smell as sweet. That Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, meaning that dear perfection he owes without title. This is in effect negative fetting.

77
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,570
In effect, although you don't call it negative fatting.

78
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,080
And the the reason why we are in the present dilemma, if you look at Article.

79
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,080
76， as my honourable friend。

80
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,990
Ronnie Tong pointed out every legislative enactment.

81
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:05,700
is supposed to go through the legislative scrutiny of the Legislative Council before it is passed into law. That is how our system work, and that is why.

82
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:26,100
The administration is facing so many problems and so many arguments over this bill because it is not following the usual procedure of legislative enactment, allowing this council to have a full debate, full deliberation before this bill comes into operation. Now, be that as it may, I understand the.

83
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:46,110
Administration is taking an unusual measure in unusual circumstances by putting forward special stamp duties in order to stamp the heat of the housing market. We understand the policy objective, but it still remains the case that this is a very unusual way of putting forward legislation.

84
00:10:46,310 --> 00:11:00,690
by allowing it to come into operation retrospectively on the date of its announcement, and this is an unusual feature which administration must accept. This is not how things are done in the usual way.

85
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:20,430
And that is why when you take away exemption, when you take away exemption which you have announced, which you have represented to the people in Hong Kong that such exemption will take place, that you can't simply on a U-turn or on a sudden change of policy.

86
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:35,840
decide retrospectively that ah now we're not going to have this exemption because of whatever reason. So whoever fools out there believe that this exemption would apply is ah is to their own fault.

87
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:56,320
They have no one else to blame but themselves because this is only a blue bill. But this is not how a responsible government should behave. Because you know very well this bill will come into operation on the twenty seventh of October two thousand and twelve. You know this is a very unusual procedure and you know that people rely on your representation.

88
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:14,380
not by only by way of the bill, but also by way of the staff in Revenue who's been repeatedly telling people that Hong Kong permanent resident miners will be exempted from paying special stamp duty, but on a sudden U-turn, you change that policy.

89
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:23,310
disregarding all the representations, all the transactions that people have relied upon that representation in making.

90
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,270
So this is an unusual, unusual legislative.

91
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:40,030
procedure， and that's why we put in the CSA to remedy the effect of a sudden U-turn or change of policy on the part of administration.

92
00:12:40,310 --> 00:13:00,320
Not allowing the stamp duty to bite on transactions that has already entered into prior to the gazetted date of this ordinance, so that transactions or people who have relied on the representation of the administration regarding the exemption will not be affected.

93
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:20,630
so as to reduce the retrospective or uncertainty that will be caused by the sudden U-turn or change of policy on the part of administration, so as to reduce the uncertainty that will be caused by this bill, and it comes back to the reason why we believe the CSA.

94
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,840
是 important in preserving that cardinal principle in our legal system, that is of certainty.

95
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:47,130
Mr President, I shall, if necessary, rise again to address some of the replies or comments made by my colleagues. But there is only one point which I would address, which the Secretary has raised yesterday in objection to my CSA, which is that my amendment.

96
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,770
Only comes into effect on the gazette of on the gazzetto of the bill.

97
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,960
But and and during that period, he say it will cause further uncertainty.

98
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:19,250
We're talking about a matter of days before you gazette this bill. Once it is passed, it is absurd to say that there will be numerous miners rushing to buy properties before the gazette of this bill. You're talking about matters of days. You could do it as soon as possible, and I think it is an excuse.

99
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,570
to say that it will cause further uncertainty when the very uncertainty

100
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,000
那 is being caused is your U-turn or your sudden change of policy, which we are trying to address.

101
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,720
President, thank you.

102
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:42,900
誒主席，呢一節嘅合拼辯論咧，係關於豁免為未成年人購買住宅物業繳納。

103
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:56,280
買家印花税及有關收有關誒徵收額外印花税及買家印花税相關條文停止生效嘅日期，咁呢節我誒喺度發言咧，係先要誒報告。

104
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:06,230
誒誒法案委員會裏邊討論啊，就住係誒加入日落條款嘅內容。噉我其實會代表法案委員會咧，就提出。

105
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:19,120
誒四項嘅動議啊，包括係第四項啊，建議咧係定明徵收額外印花税嘅相關條文於二零一四年十二月三十一日午夜停止生效。咁呢一個。

106
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:34,080
誒建呢個動議咧，由張宇人議員提出，經法案委員會誒通過咧，由我本人代為提出。第五項嘅誒動議內容咧，係建議喺第七十條加入第四及第五款，以定名就。

107
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:54,370
徵收額外印花税嘅相關條文於二零一五年十月廿六日午夜到期。呢一項嘅誒動議咧，原係由梁君彥議員提出，亦都係喺同日經法案委員會咧係通過，由我本人咧喺度提出。咁第六項嘅內容咧，就係建議。

108
00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:14,380
以誒係建議喺第七十條加入第四、第五款，以定明就徵收買家印花税嘅相關條文，於二零一四年十二月三十一日午夜停止生效。咁呢一個建議亦都係由誒張宇仁議員提出，噉啊經法案委員會通過咧，由我本人喺度提出。咁第七。

109
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:34,390
項嘅誒動議內容咧，就係建議喺第七十條加入第四、第五款，以定明就徵收買家印花税嘅相關條文，於二零一五年十月廿六日午夜到期。呢一個建議咧，係由原動議人阿梁君賢議員提出，亦都經法案委員會咧係通過由。

110
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,570
由我本人提出。

111
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:56,130
咁法案委員會咧，其實曾多次討論誒應否就有應否就需求管理措施定立日落條款。咁部分委員認為政府應設定客觀及可量化嘅指標，以提高政府就撤回有關措施所作決定嘅透明度，讓商業投資者同埋置業人士可進行。

112
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:16,140
整體風險評估，以及喺知情嘅情況下作出取得物業嘅決定。有委員促請政府咧係就有關措施定立日落條款，喺政策上給予商界同埋市民確定性，以維持商界嘅信心及物業市場嘅平穩發展。另一方面，部分委。

113
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:27,360
委員咧對日落條款咧表示有保留。委員咧認為咧係冇單一嘅指標可以完全反映物業市場嘅狀況。由於物業市場性質複雜，加上外圍。

114
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:47,660
加上各項外圍因素影響，預設一個認為無需再推行有關措施嘅日期咧，係不切實際，亦可能會向市場發出錯誤訊息及刺激需求，從而削弱有關措施嘅成效。政府當局咧亦都承諾會喺條例草案獲通過後一年進行檢討，並向。

115
00:17:47,660 --> 00:18:07,670
立法會啊作出彙報，而詳細嘅誒法案委員會討論嘅內容咧，亦都再列喺誒法案委員會嘅報告文件當中。噉我相信各位委員咧都係收到㗎啦。咁由於我係喺呢一節咧，係代表法案委員會誒。

116
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:25,800
誒去提出呢個動議有呢個發言嘅時間，我會先讓咧動議嘅議員咧誒原動議嘅議員或者其他議員咧表述佢對誒呢啲動議內容嘅睇法，然後我再就民建聯誒就住上述嘅誒條文咧作出誒。

117
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,700
誒民建聯立場嘅展述嘅，主席本人僅此陳詞。楊君健議員。

118
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:41,490
主席，我喺法案委員會審議階段係提出咗兩項日落條款嘅修正，即係而家由法案委員會主席誒李慧瓊議員代表委員會提出嘅。

119
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,950
將限期定喺二零一五年十月二十六日嘅修訂。

120
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,630
基民聯誒建議將日落時間定喺二零一五年十月。

121
00:18:52,980 --> 00:19:12,990
夜六日午夜就係原因係本誒原本額外印花税，即二零一一年嘅相關修訂法案限期係至二零一二年十月夜六日，故此修訂以十月夜六日為限期，符合政府由兩年拉長到三年嘅目標。

122
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,370
亦都畫條日落線，就係因為我哋要確保政府會。

123
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:28,840
為依項非常時期嘅非常措施，啊，白紙黑字寫法例上一個最後檢討同埋撤銷嘅限期。

124
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:39,820
因為一個信奉自由經濟嘅社會，就唔應該有一條永久歧視非本地人，或變相懲罰選擇以公司名義買物業嘅人士。

125
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:59,710
主席，官員喺審議法案時係多次強調，香港並唔係全球唯一一個有額外印花税嘅地方，但係大家都好清楚，額外印花税依種行政手段去幹預物業市場喺國際上並唔係常見嘅做法。

126
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:20,000
政府嘅資料亦都顯示到，同樣有額外印花税嘅澳門就喺引入依項措施新税後嘅兩年作出檢討。由此可見，喺適當時候就印花税作嘅措施係作出檢討係的確係有其必要。依個正係經。

127
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,010
民聯多番強調，訂立日落條款。

128
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,140
但。

129
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:44,510
非但唔向不會向市場發放錯誤嘅信息，而且更符合草案嘅立法原意，為物業市場嘅長遠正常運作提供多一重嘅保險。因此咧，我完全唔同意局長喺恢復議讀時候所講嘅定立入落條款會對市場。

130
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,310
釋出創嘅信息，刺激到日後嘅需求。

131
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,950
正如我喺法案恢復議讀時係講。

132
00:20:52,230 --> 00:21:01,950
面對美國退市、減少買債、融資成本趨高、市場情緒向下嘅情況，本港嘅樓市係存有下滑嘅風險。

133
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:22,300
負資產嘅情況係有機會重現。作為一個負責任任嘅政府官員，應該係吸取歷史嘅教訓，喺辣椒推出過後嘅適當時間去緊審慎去審視辣椒嘅成效同埋需要，以及有關嘅税收水平。

134
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:42,310
嘅形同埋形式，就要畀市民同市場清楚睇到政府喺依個，我會檢討嘅決心係做好最好嘅方法。就係因為啊條例草案定下一落條款嘅理由啊，因為其實一個非常時期。

135
00:21:42,310 --> 00:22:02,320
啊，去啊，做一個非常時期嘅措施咧。啊，經民聯係認同嘅，但係依個非常時期咧係唔係非常長期，因為依個嚴重係扭曲一個市場，所以政府一定要有決心啊，話畀市場聽，佢係會利用依一個啊。

136
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:22,330
辣椒依個時間去做好嘅工作，例如搞好土地嘅啊供應啊，誒搞好個麵粉同埋製造麵包嘅成本啊，畀市民有個決心，知道係有長期啊嘅地係繼續供應嘅。咁誒，我亦都想回應咧誒。

137
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:33,330
局長喺第一個組啊分組嗰陣時咧，就話啊，我哋嘅修訂咧係冇共識嘅，我想指出畀啊。

138
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:53,620
局長知咧係有共識嘅。如果冇共識咧，就法案委員會主席就唔會代表我哋提出嘅。咁當然大家每個政黨有佢嘅投票決定，但喺當日咧係有共識，係畀誒李慧瓊議員咧作為法案委員會主席咧係。

139
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:03,990
係代表我哋出啊，去提出呢樣嘢，咁所以我希望咧，即係局長都啊要考慮呢一點嘅。主席，我跟次陳詞。謝李先生。

140
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,010
兩件。

141
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,210
我會 first 講 on the.

142
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:20,120
C.S.A. amendment of the Honourable Dennis Cokk. I'm sorry that he is not here to to listen to what I've said.

143
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
他的演講 has given me.

144
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,280
An insight.

145
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,530
of the civic parties, southern.

146
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,760
and better than not having it.

147
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,670
某種 resurrected sense of justice。

148
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,150
係啲。

149
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:48,640
not supported, the honourable, Regius C S A vis-à-vis the government's machine of taking over the C S A.

150
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,080
他會 not have created.

151
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,590
那 uncertainty。

152
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,220
由 civic party。

153
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,180
having supported that.

154
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,530
政府C.S.A. or depriving the eighteen years old.

155
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,080
Right.

156
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,330
to own a property, as he gallantly defended that the drafting of the bill, not only the drafting of the bill.

157
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:21,200
the the very nature of the bill that the government

158
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,390
have initially expressed that they have given the right through.

159
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:34,140
equality through the basic the 18 years old Hong Kong permanent resident.

160
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:44,050
或18歲或under 18歲香港居民，都有權購買物業，不需支付15%。

161
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,290
The civic party members.

162
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:59,600
To many citizens in Hong Kong, they were perceived were I use the word were perceived to be the defenders of the faith in defending our core values.

163
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,670
They were perceived.

164
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:12,090
to be the custodian of the protection of rights of citizen. That's how the city civic party originated from the forty five concern group.

165
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,180
Now, yesterday they have done something completely different. I have challenged the Civic Party.

166
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,340
to to debate with me, why they have not said anything.

167
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,950
當原的草擬法案。

168
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,900
給給的rights to the under eighteen HKPRs。

169
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,530
They said nothing.

170
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,530
and at the same time, when the

171
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,460
當The CS Government CSA。

172
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,160
was tabled. They had. I have also asked them to say something. They said nothing.

173
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,580
所以，佢哋 make their bed of thorns，佢哋佢哋 have to be prepared。

174
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,070
to lion it.

175
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,820
而 now in his CSA.

176
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:05,320
丹尼斯講 about certainty， which I totally agree with him， and talk about predictability。

177
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,840
但，why seek certainty when you have created uncertainty?

178
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,140
因為你有支持政府CSA。

179
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:28,890
I personally support you your your CSA to the extent that you are removing some sense of uncertainty from people outside this who has not been protected.

180
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,160
As they originally being.

181
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,650
I believe to have been.

182
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,010
told that they have that rights.

183
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,200
Dennis， as a barrister， and I。

184
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:57,770
And as a person that I know you very well, to the extent that you speak the truth, but somehow silence to the truth, as I said earlier, is worse than ignorance of the truth. I really don't understand why Civic Party supported.

185
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,770
政府CSA on the under 18.

186
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,970
Mr. President, although Denis Cough has

187
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:17,350
Come out and with the CSA, but the very nature that he has supported Regina the government CSA, I find despite of this.

188
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:33,470
matter. I found this his CSA reasonable, and hence I tried to ask myself to support him. But writing is wrong for a period of time when they when in the original place, the whole concept is wrong.

189
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,430
Why don't you do it?

190
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:53,800
As pointed out by the submission, as I think Dennis yesterday actually raised a case by the Messrs Wong Hoy and Company Solicitors, the original bill excluded from the BSD. I think that was the the case that you referred.

191
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,620
EDUCs who sign sale or purchase agreement as trustee for Hong Kong miners.

192
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:12,040
After the bill was consented, the Inland Revenue openly confirmed this position through Q&A and articles published on its website and through its telephone enquiry services.

193
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,620
It turns out that many people have been deprived.

194
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,620
由的 unforeseen U-turn in stripping the Hong Kong permanent resident miners.

195
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,250
of the B.S.D. exemption.

196
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,570
I think this was the case referred to. If I'm wrong, tell me.

197
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,590
Clearly, it will be unfair to those relying on the original bill, as you have stated earlier.

198
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:43,060
和代表由IRD和政府官員在這個理事會。

199
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:59,710
They have those people have signed agreement to act as trustee for Hong Kong PR miners before before aware that the government would have accepted the origin the honourable Regine's ICSA and withdrew and removed the exemption.

200
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,560
政府會輕易回覆你，Mr. Cock。

201
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,370
Nobody ask them to buy.

202
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,870
Nobody ask them to listen to government. This government always changes his mind.

203
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,780
The certainty is， don't buy until the law's passed.

204
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:30,150
They don't. They don't care about what misrepresentation is all about. They are not lawyers, or even if they're legal advice, they have different legal advice. They they choose to listen whatever they decided to.

205
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,750
政府應向公眾説明。

206
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:43,720
這這撤銷了，一個簽署於1998年的《受託人對於香港PR礦業》的協議，之前宣佈將會受影響。

207
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,120
The administration says that.

208
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:58,800
The suggestions not to apply the relevant CSA to acquisitions of residential property by Hong Kong PR miners through their trustee or guardians before cassating the amendment.

209
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,580
Ordinance.

210
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:11,510
would be contradictory to the principle of processing bills, and would cause the public unnecessary confusion regarding the BSD regime.

211
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:21,470
However, it is obvious that it was the government that first confused the market by disseminating erroneous messages.

212
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,560
Now, the whole concept that the opposition camp.

213
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,700
Yesterday, voted against.

214
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:37,200
the negative the negative wetting, and now that you have in a way asked the government

215
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:48,590
to grandfather, grandfather, the those people who have who have purchased before the gazetting of this ordinance.

216
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:59,970
所以你係實際，ask him to eat back the，the the，challenging the very nature that the government put forth on the negative weighting。

217
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,300
this is something new and something that the government could consider, but

218
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,830
但佢哋唔係。

219
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,360
但 nobody to be blamed. The only one to be blamed, a civic party, had you.

220
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,020
你和反對派支持。

221
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,240
我，在我的反對。

222
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,110
到這項修訂。

223
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,530
We don't have to face this music.

224
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:37,120
Thank you for for for doing that, and now I cannot support you because I cannot use one wrong, one right to remedy a wrong. The wrong itself is wrong. Thank you, Mr. President.

225
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,150
呢位建議。

226
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,430
係。

227
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:58,490
主席，我先就民建聯嘅立場咧，回表述一下我哋對呢次綜合辯論各項嘅議案啲睇法。就郭榮亨議員提出個修正案咧，其實誒作為法案委員會嘅成員同主席咧，我記得都係比較後期。

228
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:04,420
嘅時間咧，先至交入嚟法案委員會係誒，當我哋。

229
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:13,330
阿葉劉淑儀議員嗰個C.S.A已經討論完畢，亦都政府知識政府已經係誒係接受。

230
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:34,970
基本上，我嘅理解係法案委員會完成之後咧，國議員再提出嘅。所以其實琴日啊，國議員講嘅論點咧，我都係好仔細聆聽。當時誒收當時收到國議員呢個建議咧，我都覺得係誒有佢嘅道理嘅，因為我哋當時提希望取消未成年小朋友。

231
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,640
個闊面當然係唔想影響其他人嘅，雖然我我哋知道係少數。

232
00:32:40,310 --> 00:33:00,320
誒，但係咧，就當我向政府當局查詢咧，佢哋就反應非常大嘅，因為呢個係違反一般法律嘅原則，因為所有人咧不能夠認為咧法例生效前咧係不應該假設咧整條法例嘅原整條法例係會原裝通過，並應該唔應該對此有合理期望。噉啊，聽。

233
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:08,240
呢個法律觀點噉，我都覺得係有道理嘅。咁冇理由，冇理由誒未通過就當佢係。

234
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:28,530
嗯，可以通過，而跟住就係誒有一個誒，因為噉就要做翻呢個呢個呢個豁免，讓翻佢哋唔受影響。不過即係大家都係同樣係法律界啦，各議員由各議員提出，佢亦都係法律界人士。咁政府嗰個法律觀點亦都係法律界人士提出。噉我其實又唔係好理解，咁所以。

235
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,620
而想向阿國議員或者其他議員啦，都啊～

236
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:48,990
查詢一下嘅就係頭先誒誒都阿郭議員都指出咧，就係話誒呢一個做法咧係好常係好罕見嘅，因為咧係嗰個藍紙草案嗰個標裏邊咧係誒有一個追索力。

237
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,960
啊！

238
00:33:51,240 --> 00:34:11,250
令到咧就呢啲無辜嘅人士誒受損噉，我想問是否喺你或或者喺其他法律界人士都可以話畀同我哋分享一下，即係是否呢啲情況真係係只係呢條標先會有咧？因為如果喺我哋個考慮嚟講，我就覺得如果政府嗰個論述係成立嘅話咧，誒，我主要考主要支持佢原因。

239
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:31,260
就係我亦都唔想構成先例，因為如果係噉，誒第時有啲標喺度討論，誒未討論完，咁市民就誒基於呢個藍紙草案嘅內容做咗啲事情，而跟住又向本會嘅議員申述，噉就要求本會議員協助，然後咧我哋就誒誒誒豁免翻佢，咁咁似乎又係唔係好合理？咁所以我又其實想。

240
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:51,270
先誒做一啲誒誒澄清，想做一啲瞭解先嘅。噉我哋民建聯當然唔希望，因為我哋法案委員會嘅議員或者包括我哋提出要求政府處理呢個漏洞，而影響到呢啲買家。而我哋相信咧，呢啲買家咧當時誒透過未成年人誒。

241
00:34:51,270 --> 00:35:11,280
監護人或者係佢爹哋媽咪買咧，係亦都係誒恩實嘅。不過另一個觀點，我哋都問過，及後我哋都問過我哋嘅法律部，佢都話：喂，理論上佢嘅律師應該提醒佢呢個條例草案未通過嘅，噉係都有可能誒條例草案通過之後有唔同，亦都有機會咧係不獲豁免買。

242
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:19,830
計印花税，噉我唔知呢點喺法律觀點上，誒幾位朋友可唔可以都有啲回應，讓我哋對呢個議題咧可以多啲深入瞭解。

243
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,590
主席本人嘅私情節。

244
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,230
張麗雲議。

245
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,880
唔該，主席。

246
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,770
其實就誒有關呢個設定嗰個日落條款嘅問題咧。

247
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,570
即係其實啊！

248
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:50,350
啊，即係諗深一層咧，其實咧係有啲唔合邏輯嘅，因為咧今次咧就啊，正如係啊，大家呢幾日都有辯論有關先定立後審議啊呢一類嘅嘢。

249
00:35:50,630 --> 00:36:08,860
咁因為啊，假如任何嘢係牽涉到咧重大預重大嘅利益，而以預告式嘅制度去推出嘅話咧，肯定咧會係為市場咧係帶嚟好多不可估計嘅影響。

250
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:29,150
咁即係，正如話誒，大家都知道嚇，二零一四年嚇十二月三十一日誒，假如就將會係啊呢一個誒取消有關嘅印花税啦。咁噉啊，肯定咧喺呢段期間咧，今年咧肯定真係冇人會買樓㗎啦。

251
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:38,060
大家都會等到呢個二零一五年頭嚇，噉啊一月一號可能大家都唔去旅行，個個去排隊買樓。

252
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:59,270
咁咧就誒，其實政府推出嚇呢一啲嘅啊啊雙辣椒啊噉樣，咁咧都係因應市場嗰個調節嚇供需問題嚇，同埋市民社會大眾嘅反應先至去定。

253
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:19,280
出嘅又正如早前有關限奶令噉啊，亦都有議員提出係希望誒訂立誒一個入落條款係嘛？咁但係政府都要回應翻誒負責任地誒要拒絕呢一個噉嘅。

254
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,090
要求，因為你。

255
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:42,670
今日臨時推出一個，喺邊盡快推出一個政策啊！只係因為個市場出現咗一個突變啊！我相信當有日個市場回復自然嗰陣時，回復正常嗰陣時，政府能夠調控到嗰陣時，我相信。

256
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:51,500
相信啊，有關嘅一啲必須嘅政策，一定會自然，亦都會係或者係取消。

257
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:10,590
而我哋立法會議員咧，即係大家都知道，我哋啊唔止有立法權，有啊呢個啊呢個，亦都有廢除一啲法律嘅權利。嚇，相信到適當嘅時候，自然啊有關心嘅議員就會提出呢方面嘅意見啦。

258
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:30,910
所以咧，即係無論限奶令又好，或者我哋今次雙辣椒啊呢個呢個嘅定立咧，係都應該都係為回應市場嘅要求，即係嚇，即係市民啊，實際上有亦都渴求希望呢一個雙辣椒能夠盡快係。

259
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:50,920
誒喺我哋嘅立法會通過，而我亦都支持政府呢一個嘅啊行啊呢一個誒誒嘅嘅政策嘅推出，因為我話我認為佢係真正係為咗呢個社會嚇，為咗回應市民嘅需求而推出有關嘅政策，噉啊本。

260
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,090
本人僅次陳馳。

261
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,270
江淮風雨。

262
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,150
啊，主席。

263
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:06,800
又喺美國推出量化寬鬆、實行低利息嘅政策咧，令到新興市場嘅資產大幅嘅飆升。

264
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:24,590
香港亦都難存其身。過去幾年，本港樓價好似坐火箭噉，即係累重新高，遠遠超過市民負擔嘅能力，造成一個好大嘅社會問題，導致民怨四起。故此，新一屆嘅政府。

265
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:39,560
為了遏制樓市不尋常嘅升勢，誒連環使出辣招為樓市降温，市民基本上係歡迎，但係問題在於政府嘅觀念，往往為求達到目的。

266
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:49,880
啊！無所用，無所不用其技，甚至出現咗殺重糧慢嘅現象。我所講嘅咧，就係有軍。

267
00:39:50,170 --> 00:40:10,180
受託人方式為未成年子女置業嘅安排，本係政府定出嘅修訂，令日後以呢種方式購置誒物業嘅人士，不再豁免買印花，不再豁免買加印花税。呢個係無可厚非，亦都支持。

268
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:30,190
嘅問題就政府突然間咧就唔認數啊，推翻先前嘅承諾，要追翻買家嘅印花税，由二零一二年十月二十六號買家印花税公佈當日起計起計翻轉頭，連到原先信政府所講以信託方。

269
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:50,200
方式，未成年子女置業唔使交十五個percent印花税嘅人，而家都失去預算，不知如何是好。市民政府點解點樣向呢班人交代咧？因為呢筆數目絕對唔少，今日嘅樓價咧，一般都。

270
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,350
痕痕哋都要五六百萬，即係要畀多咧七八十萬嘅印花税。

271
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:15,930
如果上千萬嘅當然咧要畀到咧幾百萬嘅印花税。主席，我熟悉嘅朋友之中，亦都因為早前受託人嘅方式，給子女咧即係置業咧就唔需要咧買印花税，但如需要付印花税，但係而家畀政府追。

272
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:25,280
講到咧就好激氣，同埋覺得畀政府誒即係愚弄，因為佢唔係炒家，佢係香港永久居民。

273
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:45,600
只不過係為自己嘅子女置業，等子女面對前景時少少咗一重嘅擔憂。就因為政府突然間咧改變主意，而今就中咗招，無端端咧要畀好多税，佢好想知道點解政府會噉樣唔講道理嗱。

274
00:41:45,600 --> 00:42:01,620
招致在打擊醜家，為何要呢啲無辜嘅香港市民一齊陪枕？主席，你都知道事前事件嘅搞到而家，同政府突然間喺上個月接受葉劉淑儀議員嘅建議。

275
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:10,230
一刀切嘅收回現先准許為未成年子女以信託方式置業。

276
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
sorry。

277
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:32,370
誒確豁免買家印花税嘅承諾，而政府又唔肯接受郭榮亨以前嘅建議，由十二月由十由一九由二零一二年十月二十七日至本條例通過及誒顯誒罕顯時間豁免違背承諾。

278
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:43,970
香港永久居民業者繳交印花税，我認為政府堅持係毫無道理，根本咧就唔能夠令人信服。

279
00:42:44,500 --> 00:43:01,250
因為由公佈誒實行買家印花税，到政府上個月突然改變立場，成年禁制，而家要叫人交翻所有嘅買家嘅印花税，但係人哋當初買樓就～

280
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:06,530
就唔係因就因為咧，政府所講嘅可以豁免。

281
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,000
先至話子女自業。

282
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:19,340
唔係話咧，而家政府準備收嚟，自匆匆入市，市民政府點解會咁唔講信用？人哋仲～

283
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:39,630
點樣咧？信你講嘅嘢咧？主席，我想政府此政府此政府嘅此道政，我想政府啊此道理，依不不顧嘅行為，誒唔講考詞嘅做法，只會令到市民對政府嘅誠信同埋施政毫無信心。

284
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:46,830
希望政府引以為鑑。本人僅此陳詞，支持郭榮鏗議員嘅修正。多謝。

285
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,650
郭榮亨議。

286
00:43:48,930 --> 00:44:08,940
主席，啊，本人想回應一下頭先啊幾位議員提出嘅問題。啊，李慧瓊議員咧頭先問到話，其實誒呢啲噉樣嘅做法係咪好罕見，係咪誒好少有？大家都知道，其實我哋一我哋喺我哋嘅憲制框架底下，一般嗰個立法程序咧，都係一定係先。

287
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:28,950
要經過啊立法會嘅審議，然後先生效。當然有一啲附屬法例係可以經過negative即係誒負面審議，或者係誒先定立後審議，或者喺依個條例係先生效後審議嘅一啲誒做法都有。但係先生效。

288
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:48,960
後審議嘅主要法案，而仍而係會影響到咁多人嘅權利嘅話咧，係非常非常之罕有。我記得誒嗰時審議限奶令嘅時候咧，我哋有問過政府：喂，你誒噉樣一限奶令，亦都係先生效後。

289
00:44:48,960 --> 00:45:08,970
審議㗎嘛，亦都係一開始就就誒有有法律效用。跟住點解大家就係佢之後嗰個條文出咗問題，拉錯人啦。之後後屘咪有個有個爭議，就係點解咁做咁？當時我哋亦都問過政府，政府嘅回應咧都係話先生效後審議，好似呢啲噉樣有刑責嘅。

290
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:16,960
嘅法案咧係非常非常之罕見，唔係必要時期咧，佢哋都係唔會咁做嘅，因為佢哋知道一旦。

291
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:31,420
誒生效咗，任何人士違反呢條法例咧，都會可能要負上刑責。而呢條法案係未經過立法會嘅審議咧，呢啲噉樣嘅做法係非常之罕見。而呢個。

292
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:45,190
我哋手上揸住嘅男子草案，佢嗰個做法咧，其實亦都係非常非常之罕有。一般嘅法例根本上都唔會咁做嘅，唔會話先生效後審議，而佢生效咗之後咧。

293
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,360
誒。

294
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:57,960
如果佢係改變任何由誒二零一二年十月開始之後，佢改變任何嘅誒當中嘅條文咧？

295
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:18,250
佢係會影響好多人，佢哋買賣樓宇或者係啊做呢啲啊買賣嘅時候嗰個嘅權利。頭先張華峯議員都舉過一個例子，就係即係佢識嘅朋友係點樣受到影響。呢個我都唔需要係詳細去解釋，大家都知道你買咗以本來以為唔使交嘅，點知原來政

296
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:38,260
府而家追交翻，咁呢個係影響好好好好麻煩嘅，即係平時根本上法例就唔會咁做，所以答翻你慧瓊議員咧，就係誒一般嚟講，根本上法例係唔會去用呢個途徑。如果你係真係非常時期啦，我哋都知道呢個係非常時期要打壓樓市嘅一個非常手段，咁但係你都唔可以。

297
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:46,590
咁離譜就係話啊！我而家朝政力改就係話誒誒，我我我中意誒誒。

298
00:46:46,870 --> 00:47:06,880
今日就同你講話係啊，會有依個豁免嘅。聽日我中意改係啊，你傻啫嘛！依個都唔係法律嚟嘅，都未係法律。噉你自己信信錯人咯。咁呢個咩政府啫？噉你仲話叫我哋信你嗰啲咩口頭承諾啊？仲話叫你信信你講話得㗎啦！我好有承擔㗎，我真係誒好莊嚴噉樣向你向你作出承諾第時。

299
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:26,890
會點點點咁？你連呢個寫咗喺度，你自己周圍同人講，即係你嗰啲誒誒税局嗰啲人同人講話得㗎啦，會豁免㗎。我我聽日又轉嘅噉，你叫市民點信服啫？所以即係答翻你維瓊議員咧嘅嘅誒嘅問題咧，就係即係係好少做，但係你做都唔可以做到咁離譜。

300
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:33,070
如果你真係改嘅話，起碼你畀翻嗰個喺嗰段時間信咗你嗰啲人。

301
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,920
佢哋買咗嘢，透過誒誒。

302
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:57,210
監護人或者信託為子女買咗誒樓宇嗰啲啦，起碼佢哋唔應該受到影響咯。噉你都話頭先局長都有講過話，相信呢一類人其實唔係好多。咁如果唔係好多嘅話，佢哋對對樓市對價格所造成嗰個嘅嘅嘅影響都唔係咁多啦。個税款亦都唔。

303
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:04,510
唔係話數目會好大啦，咁點解你一定要去追翻呢啲人咧？呢個係太霸道，太唔講道理。

304
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:18,870
Mr. President, in further response to my learned, my honourable friend Abraham Schex grave allegations that the Civic Party has been neglecting its its duty in defending

305
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:24,500
the rule of law and our legal system and the rights of the Hong Kong citizens.

306
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:42,450
as as I've pointed out, I think there's been a fundamental misunderstanding that my friend is misconceived in his argument that we are not somehow protecting the rights of Hong Kong permanent residents minors by supporting the CSA proposed by Regina Yip.

307
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,170
That is not so.

308
00:48:44,450 --> 00:49:04,460
在眼，的法律，，as I've said yesterday。在眼，的法律，，we've always treated minors as somewhat different from adults。as any first-year law student would tell you，that minors do not have the legal capacity to enter into transactions。that's why the law required them to

309
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:24,470
Enter via trustees and guardians. We've always treated minors differently. It is not discrimination, nor is unequal treatment. Now, if Mr. If Mr. Schäck wants to argue that we should perhaps lower the age of voting to below 18, I'll be happy to engage him in that argument. But the fact remains.

310
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:33,410
means that we've always the law has always treated miners as different. So, as a matter of policy, as a matter of policy, when it comes to this bill, we can.

311
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:51,870
Then have different views on whether minors should be exempted. That is a matter of policy, not a matter of fundamental right. We may differ on whether, as a matter of policy, they should be exempted. We are the view that they they they they should not by supporting this this CSA.

312
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:02,030
I I respect you. You you see the matter differently, but it is not as you put it a fundamental question of rule of law or the right of

313
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,690
of miners to to acquire properties, nor is it discrimination.

314
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:27,380
And in further reply to Mr. Schek's point about the need to deal with the retrospective effect of these exemptions not applying to transactions that were entered since October 2012, the law has always been very.

315
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,100
sceptical.

316
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:42,730
very worried about retrospective legislative effect, especially those that has not been through the scrutiny of legislator. We've always been very wary of that. That is true throughout the common law world, not only in this jurisdiction.

317
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:55,030
我found last night a judgement handed down by the Canadian Supreme Court by the learned judge De Jean J, where she put it very succinctly.

318
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:05,100
Explaining why retrospective legislation are to be avoided at all costs, unless only in exceptional circumstances.

319
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,080
And she said, and I quote.

320
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:24,330
There are a number of rules of interpretation that can be helpful in identifying the situations to which new legislation applies, because of the need for certainty. Because of the need for certainty, I repeat and emphasise as to the legal consequences that attach to past facts and conduct.

321
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:31,170
courts have long recognised that the cases in which legislation has retrospective effect must be exceptional.

322
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:39,680
must be exceptional. More specifically, where legislative provisions affect either vested or substantive rights, as they do in this case.

323
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:59,970
因為你講緊關於實際實質權力， of people acquiring properties， and we know how important that that right is in this jurisdiction. Retrospectivity has been found to be undesirable. is undesirable. New legislation that affects substantive rights will be presumed to have only prospective effect.

324
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:06,450
Unless it is possible to discern a clear legislative intent that it is to apply retrospectively.

325
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:20,560
So there you have it. The the the court, the Canadian Supreme Court, there very eloquently summarises why we have always avoided retrospectivity in any legislation.

326
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:40,930
Because it damages the certainty of the law, and you are talking about past conduct and past actions being subject to the law, affecting the substantive rights of people, and that's why we we oppose it as a matter of principle, and that's why we need to pass.

327
00:52:40,930 --> 00:53:00,940
this CSA，that's why we move this CSA，so as to so as to address this problem that will arise whenever you have a legislating legislation affecting substantive right having retrospective effect，it is not to be decided，it is undesirable，and we are trying to reduce the uncertainty，the negative effect of this legislation。

328
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,710
legislation。

329
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,060
兩個相處。

330
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:27,000
多謝主席。我想就呢幾個日落條款，四個日落條款咧，綜合作出一啲嘅回應。咁呢四個日落條款包括有額外印花税S S D喺二零一四年十月三十號午夜停止生效，S S D喺二零一五年十月二十六號午夜前生效失效，同埋咧。

331
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,790
另外兩個嘅修訂就包括馬家印花税B.S.D喺二零一四年十月三十一號午夜前停止生效。

332
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:43,400
同埋B.S.D.買家印花税喺二零一五年咧十月二十六日午夜前咧係停止生效嘅。

333
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,960
嗱，所謂日落條款。

334
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:50,050
身失provision啦，嗱睇翻呢一類嘅。

335
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:59,670
provision嘅歷史咧，其實唔係我哋呢一啲嘅普通法嘅司法管轄區咧，係好常見嘅。

336
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:06,780
其實 sunset provision咧個源於咧就係一個大陸法嘅條文，係個Roman law嚟嘅。

337
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,640
噉，但係咧。

338
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:17,670
喺普通法國家入邊，喺邊啲國家係會好通常採用咧？係美國比較多啲。就算通常採用咧，都係非常罕見。

339
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:24,270
嗱，所謂新式provision咧，呢個條款咧就話咧係指明咧喺條條例入邊。

340
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:39,970
有一個條款，令到嗰條條例或者條例入邊嘅某一個部分咧，係喺一個某一個日子入邊係終止生效，嗱，直至另一個新嘅啊條款咧係另立新嘅法律。

341
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,650
嗱，我睇過香港嘅法律。

342
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,740
加拿大嘅法律同埋英國嘅法律。

343
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:56,850
嗱，其實日落條款幾時先會應用到咧？係非常非常之罕有。我可以舉一個例子。

344
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:10,400
近期喺英國嘅法例入邊有應用到日落條款咧，就其實佢哋喺二零零五年啊，係啊通過咗一個叫Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005。

345
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:21,950
嗱，呢一條條例咧，就的確引起非常大嘅爭議，因為咧佢係涉及到最基本嘅人權同埋人身自由。

346
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:29,240
而當年啊，工黨政府Labour Party喺下議院。

347
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,910
去首讀呢個。

348
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:38,490
條例嘅草案時候咧，當年係二零零五年嘅二月二十二號啊！

349
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:46,490
亦都受到好多佢哋自己工黨本身嘅backbenchers嘅非常之不滿，而係唔投票。

350
00:55:47,410 --> 00:56:00,640
嗱，呢一條Prevention of Terrorism Act最主要係畀咗當時嘅Home Minister，佢嘅內政大臣咧，係可以就一啲涉嫌、涉嫌咋suspect。

351
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:08,090
進行恐怖活動嘅一啲人士咧，係進行係拚發一啲叫control order。

352
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,700
人身嘅自由令限制佢嘅自由。

353
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:32,520
嗱，呢限啊，限制人身自由令咧，control order咧，可以咧係拘禁呢一個啊所謂涉嫌嘅恐怖分子喺佢嘅住所入邊，亦都唔畀佢用佢嘅啊電話啊，或者佢嘅互聯網啊，亦都可以攝取佢嘅。

354
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:46,250
流動電話或者佢電腦入邊嘅資料嗱，呢個係一個非常之嚴重，亦都係非常之影響到呢個基本人權嘅一條條例嗱。但係當時點解？

355
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:57,930
工黨政府要去咁快去做一條草案，就因為當時實在係有噉嘅需要，亦都有幾多嘅恐怖活動喺英國本土係進行緊。

356
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,140
嗱，但係當呢條嘅。

357
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:07,560
條例草案過咗下議院之後咧，就去到上議院啦。咁上議院啲law咧。

358
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:27,920
就擺咗一個日落條款喺度，因為實際上呢條條例咧係實在太具爭議性，亦都咧影響到基本嘅人生自由嗱。呢一個咧就係一個好好嘅例子。點解我哋會有一個日落條款嗱？呢個係非常之特別情況底下先會用嘅。

359
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:37,000
嗱，咁睇翻我哋而家呢一條條例草案咧，政府所定立嘅額外印花税。

360
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,170
嘅改動，或者係新引進嘅。

361
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,050
買家印花税。

362
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:47,600
基本上咧，係一個市場調控嘅行為。

363
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,120
一個影響消費。

364
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,480
嘅調控行為。

365
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:55,770
嗱，我哋嘅經濟。

366
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:00,040
體係我哋嘅物業市場係非常之互動嘅。

367
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,680
嗱，我哋都唔係上帝，我哋都唔知道二零一四年。

368
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:12,290
嘅十二月三十一號，或者二零一五年十月二十六號，究竟？

369
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:18,750
有啲咩事情會發生？喂，究竟嗰個樓市係咪到時係會瘋狂啊？因為點樣樣？

370
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:27,460
嗱，如果到時話個樓市真係升咗百分之五十嘅，到時噉你又話啊，你個誒條例會終止生效喎，噉係咪傻㗎咧？

371
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:47,880
嗱，如果個樓市平平靜靜、無風無浪嘅時候，而有呢兩個日子擺喺度嘅時候，咁由而家開始至二零一四年十二月，或者至二零一五年十月嘅時候，係咪即係咩事都冇發生咧？係咪個個都喺度等緊採取觀望態度，令到我哋嘅樓市一潭死水？因為大家都知道，到時咧就冇。

372
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,250
冇咗個SSD又冇咗BSD啊嘛！

373
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:56,580
噉樣點解要擺兩個日子喺度咧？我都唔係太明白。嗱，當然。

374
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:17,180
日落條款另外一個做法咧，就係把一啲嘅條件，就比如話，啊當市場啊或者個樓市係降咗幾多percent，或者係到經濟係點樣樣情況嘅時候，或者甚至係美國嘅量化寬鬆係退市啊等等嘅時候咧，嗱我哋就會將呢一個誒S S

375
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:33,540
啲或者BSD咧就會取消啦。嗱，呢一個亦都唔係太一個精準嘅一種做法，因為其實我哋講緊係一條法例、一條條例。我哋唔可以有太多太闊嘅解讀，關於個經濟嘅一個情況。

376
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,880
所以咧。

377
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:55,440
總的來説咧，我都覺得日落條款如果擺喺一個市場調控嘅一條法例入邊咧，係唔係好適當嘅。嗱，再者咧，基本上咧，我都覺得日落條款咧，係喺我哋憲制框架入邊咧，係其實係冇乜地位喺我哋香港特別行政。

378
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,140
區嘅建制框架，因為其實咧，我睇過曬。

379
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:15,160
香港嘅所有法例入邊咧，係而家係暫時都未有一條法例係有用緊嘅日落條款。嗱，憲制上我哋立法會，我哋每一個議員咧係有權去審理每一條嘅法例。

380
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:21,220
反過嚟講咧，當呢條法例被廢除嘅時候咧。

381
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:32,920
正當嘅做法，尊重立法會嘅做法咧，就應該咧由立法會通過既有嘅程序咧去廢翻呢條法例。主席，我僅此陳辭。

382
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,500
先嚟先你。

383
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:59,290
Thank you, Mr. President. Dennis actually has raised a challenge for me to debate with him, but I'm not engaging in a legal debate, which I'm not as learned as you are. Secondly, I'm not a barrister; I'm just a common man seeing common rights, seeing common practice on that basis.

384
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,110
從一個common man perspective， to see what justice is all about.

385
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:11,660
你會你講 about， that children's minor rights is different from。

386
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:19,320
adopt rights. That is wrong. When a child is born, he is born with that right, or he is given the right.

387
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:24,120
how the rights is being being actually implemented.

388
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:44,630
That's a different matter because he's a minor. He need guardians guardianship. So don't confuse rights and application of that rights, Mr. Corb. I mean you are a lawyer. I I might not even be a first year student, but as a common man, I know what's common man.

389
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,130
我。

390
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,630
sense of justice.

391
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:52,200
Why didn't you talk when the government said that they have the rights?

392
01:01:52,530 --> 01:02:06,600
在第一 place as in the bill， why didn't you raise query when the government withdraw this right？ from a legal point of view， don't you see there is a big differences？

393
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,260
my dear learned friend， speak the truth。

394
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:23,770
and this is why I said your your mo your CSA I I tend spiritually I support it because you try to right the wrong, but why do you support the wrong in the first place?

395
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,250
If it's wrong, you can't find it into a right path.

396
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:33,970
that that is the essence. You talk about ritual activity.

397
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,280
我完全同意你。

398
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:42,160
That's not that's not what we used to. But our this government.

399
01:02:42,450 --> 01:03:02,460
They are God. They play God. They decided when. They use emotion. They use feelings. They use a sense. Their their their their personal judgement. They don't talk. Making law, we we do away with all this. We talk about logic. We talk about reason. Do they have reason in this bill?

400
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:11,540
taking miners right away， come on defend it， don't defend yourself because you you have supported， doesn't matter， if it's wrong it's wrong。

401
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:18,640
this is the the essence of being a good legislator, this is the essence of being a good common man.

402
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:40,850
主席，我而家想講講關於誒我嘅另外誒日落條款。我先答咗阿阿梁繼昌日落條款咧，就唔係經民聯或者係自由黨咧提出嚟，最最早提出嚟喺日落條款咧，我記得咧又係民主黨。

403
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:55,730
嚇喺誒，我唔記得咗邊條條例，我哋係我哋係淨係圖緊新嘅喺度，嚇好在喺度啫。嚇講日落條款啦，點解依個非常時期用非常守法啊嘛？非依條條例啊！

404
01:03:56,110 --> 01:04:16,120
阿阿梁先生係啊，點解啊？依條條例咧就就係因為個市道係已經控制唔到啦，咁成政府咧就出一條條例，但係依條條係臨時，因為面對一個好非常時期。如果依一條條例非常時期啊，你喺我哋依條。

405
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:36,130
條例啊！你唔可以唔點解唔可以擺個日落條款喺度？你講得好似完全唔可以有喂。就算如果係啊，你又睇唔到，好似你啊一誒政府揾你去講係啱啦。你成個係政府人講答嗰個問題噉。佢話我點睇到有將來嘅點嘅事情發生啊？誒，佢就噉啊。佢你信我啦。

406
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:56,140
你信我啦。如果市跌，我咪negative咯。我話先執行後審議咯。如果市起，我成少轉呢個政府成時轉㗎。你你而家講咩？你唔好用你嘅價值觀去睇呢個政府先啦。你用翻一個值，用翻佢個價值觀睇佢啊嘛。所以你企喺度。

407
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,380
講到好似阿張耀，我以為以為阿阿局長講緊嘢添。

408
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:20,720
你你係你個common professional，你講官法點法律個點？而家係咪未試過？你淨係睇用法，你想翻hands啊？講依個新式clause唔該，如果你唔清楚，因為你唔喺度，我知道問一問你你啲同同事誒，你你嗰邊嗰啲同事咧日落條款啊？問問阿阿阿梁議員啊，阿長毛。

409
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:36,980
佢日落條款啊，日落日落日落講咗幾講咗好多鐘頭，依個就係個日落條款咧，就希望咧唔好畀個政府有警惕，唔好唔好用個一個權係畀佢臨時用，唔係長期用。多謝主席。

410
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,670
呢個建議。

411
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:53,080
誒主席，誒多謝郭榮亨議員嘅回應。不過我佢嘅回應咧，我都未完全被説服，誒亦都想再回應一下。誒喺男子草案誒。

412
01:05:53,650 --> 01:06:04,630
公佈咗之後咧，咁確實係經過立法會審議咧，係有啲改變。雖然石禮謙議員都批評我啊，我係其中一個民建聯都係支持誒，冇辦法啦，要堵塞漏洞噉啊。

413
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:25,010
誒攞翻走嗰啲未成年人，要未成年人嘅豁免噉啊！呢個係啊，無論你同意與否，起碼琴日嘅表決咧都係立法會啊誒誒同意修改嘅。噉我哋當然聽到議員講話指控政府隨意改噉，但係呢個亦都要公道啲。呢個係確實大家都記得當時法案委員。

414
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:38,470
唔會大家都好多人批評嗰個相關漏洞，要求政府諗辦法。但係你話呢個係咪一個好嘅辦法？你話呢個係咪一個值得支持嘅辦法？呢個反而另一個問題。但係起碼經琴日嘅表決結果咧，呢個就大家同意嘅方法。

415
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:47,020
咁咁所以呢個係改變嘅原因。咁跟住就去到啊，郭議員另一個講法就係話：喂，其實誒呢啲法例咧就係誒。

416
01:06:47,300 --> 01:07:04,720
啊！有追索力嘅法案咧，係好少嘅。嗯，理解嘅噉我我亦都相信咧，係非常時期，非常措施咧，先至會考慮用呢啲噉。但係好少都，畢竟係係有嘅。咁而我估計嚟緊咧都有機會有嘅喎，係嘛？即係琴日我哋都通過咗。

417
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,970
嗰個修訂機制咁嚟緊，如果要調整嗰個印花税率。

418
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:29,430
誒，其實都有可能面對同樣嘅情況噉啊！坦白講，每次《男子草案》嚟到立法會，我哋又唔應該假設立法會啊，照單全收㗎，係咪？如果我哋都唔會有廿二次會議、四十四個小時嘅討論啦，係咪？咁即係如果噉，係咪每次如果有可能有啲嗱，即係公道啲，我都對嗰啲係誒買咗樓嘅。

419
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:49,440
嘅minus同埋佢啲受託人真係非常同情嘅。咁但係，咪每次我哋噉樣都要都要去豁免翻佢咧？今次我哋可以話喂，其實係好少人啊啊，好少人啫。我哋應該咁做噉，但係如果成為先例嘅話咧，我真係非常擔心。噉我都請下各議員，可唔可以呢方面去去講講佢嘅睇法咧？因為呢個兩邊。

420
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:59,830
都係法律意見，我哋都問過我哋法律顧問嘅啲睇法。噉我哋作為議員，我哋梗係唔希望因為我哋同意嘅一啲修訂而影響到人。但係如果作為先例，第時我哋嘅

421
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:20,140
係男子草案誒嚟咗立法會，佢有改動噉，咪會引起第另一輪誒誒呢啲噉嘅誒討論啦。噉啊，另外就係話誒，我亦都問過啲法律界朋友，佢都話喂，其實誒理論上啊，呢個非常時期非常措施存在，當佢買樓嘅時候，佢嘅法律佢嘅律師其實應該會提醒佢嘅。

422
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:40,170
係嘛，即係個條例仲喺審議當中，噉啊有可能有呢啲風險嘅。咁如果噉嘅情況底下，我哋又唔能夠話佢完全係無即係完完全係唔知情㗎喎。當然我都同意佢係好慘啊，即係我哋都即係想諗辦法去去幫佢，所以我先至係一路提問咁多問題。噉我希望同大家分享下我嘅睇法，都希望一陣間，尤其是法律界。

423
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:48,650
朋友都可以啊，幫手解答一下我呢啲疑問。噉啊，亦都請政府咧，如果陣間回應嘅時候都要講講，再説服我哋，因為啊。

424
01:08:48,930 --> 01:09:08,940
確實呢個情況係好罕見嘅，而因為我因為誒誒政府以至立法會個個個誒修訂咧，係令到有啲人咧係受到影響。噉啊，過去係點咧？有冇例子咧？點樣處理咧？咁都讓我哋議員作決定嘅時候咧，好清楚知道嗰個事實情況。咁至於日落條款嘅回應咧，我其實知道有啲支持。

425
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:26,600
嘅議員咧都係會發言嘅，我會先聽取誒提議啦。自由黨其實我都好希望聽啊啊啊啊Tommy佢其實提出日落條款個諗法，特別係佢定嗰個時限。雖然大家都係一個著情嘅時間，但係如果你睇翻嗰個時間咧，二零一四年。

426
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:32,840
十二月三十一號就停止，二零一四年十二月三十一號就距離而家好近。

427
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:49,070
即係我我其實真係未被説服誒，係係係點解咁短時間或者係呢個時間？咁雖然我都明白有個酌情權，所以我係希望聽取特別係支持有日落條款嘅同事發言，我哋再作一評回應。主席本人嘅資質，做緊新議。

428
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,870
主席，我第一次發言嘅呢個合兵辯論，我聽咗李慧瓊議員講好笑。

429
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:57,590
我我以為佢係官員添。

430
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,730
即係佢聽咗人哋又反應噉。

431
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,390
即係我照計。

432
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,330
民建聯應該。

433
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:24,180
一定係討論個好詳細啊嘅諗法，咁其實噉佢撳掣，噉我以為佢撳掣嘅講，噉佢梗係講佢自己意見啦，係嘛？原來佢話講下聽下大家意見，然後再回應噉，咁咁使乜使乜你講啫，係咪先啫？係嘛？咁仲有就係如果民建聯係真係仲好小心。

434
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:31,610
而家聽完意見先至決定嘅立場嘅，噉我尊敬你喎。不過我奇怪，就民建聯咧係一個咁有規模嘅黨。

435
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,840
照計唔會咁做嘅嚇。

436
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:45,820
所以我好奇怪，即係點解佢咁講咧？噉係嘛？噉你咪講咗啲debate啊嘛？咁怕、咁怕、咁怕debate都咪講嘢先，見定為應該、唔應該，甚至你話呢個初步意見。

437
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:54,660
咁如果人哋講，噉你咪辯論咯，係嘛？你係官員咩？你聽曬人哋講完，又自己先講喎，啊真係奇怪，真係，唔好意思啊，真係。

438
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,490
主席，我覺得咧嗰個誒李慧瓊議員所講咧，就話。

439
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:09,350
即係點解點處理嗰個所謂追訴性嘅問題咁？嗱，我我諗咧，希望大家明白咧，呢一個法例裏邊咧，即係我講喺國榮亨園嗰個修訂。

440
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,670
因為咧，第一佢係徵税。

441
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,340
而佢徵税咧，佢講明咧就係乜嘢唔徵税。

442
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,520
嗱，即係佢建議徵税嘅範圍係咁多嘅啫噉。

443
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:28,360
咁即係換句話講咧，如果一般啊，你用誒冇追索力嘅法例咧，佢就係通過咗呢個税，然後去徵税。

444
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,160
係咁㗎嘛？

445
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,840
咁如果係咁咧，就唔會發生。

446
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:40,750
因為因為幾時徵税或者咩範圍徵税咧，全部係通過咗買咗憲報之後生效。

447
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:51,750
咁所以任何人嘅行為就係而家法律係點，咁咪咁咯，徵咪徵唔徵唔徵咯，係嘛？噉啊通過咗法律之後係點，咁咪咁咪嗰用嗰個嚟計咯。

448
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:57,730
但因為本身你係有追索性，即係換句話講咧，如果我哋今日通過。

449
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,900
噉你係追索翻年幾之前？

450
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,630
就猶豫，嗰陣時已經通過咗。

451
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,870
你記住。

452
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,690
永遠冇人可以擔保政府提出嘅藍紙草案。

453
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:16,770
嗰個範圍咧，係一定通過。

454
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:20,630
但係記住，當你有追訴力嘅時候咧。

455
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,970
你就要小心啦。

456
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:30,220
人家咧係有合理嘅期望，對待你政府，你提出嘅法例係講明唔精粹。

457
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,700
嗱，如果你，

458
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,610
你你你你明白咧？就你政府相對於市民咧，係噉嘅。

459
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:40,470
因為徵税一個好強制嘅行為嚟嘅。

460
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:54,460
如果人哋按照你嘅規矩，嗱當然嗰個同同刑事未必完全一樣，但係同樣你你諗下，如果如果我哋話我哋立一個法係追訴幾耐之前嗰個刑事行為？

461
01:12:54,790 --> 01:13:00,470
噉你如果一開始立個草案嘅時候話嗰樣唔犯法，然後跟住咧就話犯法噉。

462
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:11,460
咁即係嗰位無端端做嗰個行為嘅時候，以為唔犯法，或者將會唔犯法，點知突然間拉咗坐監喎？話你啊，琴日做嗰啲就就係犯法嘅噉。

463
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:15,890
咁呢個咧，如果喺刑事咧，就一定違反憲法。

464
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:24,560
民事，我唔我唔係話你違反憲法，不過從一個所謂就係陳大謙所講嘅equitable principle。

465
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,350
郭榮亨議員所講嘅係咪公道？有冇誤導？

466
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:47,190
係咪equitable stopple？係咪stopple？即係呢個咧，即係防止咧，就係你政府講嗰啲嘢，然後跟住咧，你人哋就跟住你個行為去做佢嘅安身立命嘅嘢，然後跟住咧，你去到突然間就話誒，嗰啲其實我啊要徵税啦噉，記住喎。

467
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:54,800
而家仲仲問題大係咩咧？係政府自己抽翻出嚟喎。嗱，你話如果係議員。

468
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:06,590
議員可以修訂啊！大家議員修訂話唔得，嗰啲要徵税噉，或者嗰啲要要要徵税。咁即係徵税咧，係政府收入多咗㗎嘛，減少個豁免啊嘛。

469
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:13,830
噉你仲可以講咧，就話喂，我政府都冇冇計喎噉。咁但係當然啦，議員都自己都要諗，佢係咪應該咁做？

470
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:21,490
但係，如果由政府，而政府竟然咧無動於衷，覺得自己冇問題嘅，抽翻出嚟。

471
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:25,520
O.K.，而又冇一個噉嘅追索性嘅豁免。

472
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:45,810
噉，我覺得咧，其實本本本英國榮亨議員提出嗰個咧，就應該係政府提出嚟，就以補補足自己係藍字草案入咗一個噉樣。我唔我唔能夠話你粗疏嚇，因為你係用原本嘅原則就覺得大人同細路咁都有自居需要，你係噉樣嘅公平嘅角度。

473
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:50,510
但係起碼你抽翻出嚟呢個闊面嘅時候，係由政府應該政府入啦。

474
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:54,220
政府唔入，個人生員入咗個修訂。

475
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:59,610
咁而家咧，就其實咧，就可以處理翻一個。

476
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,040
追索性徵税。

477
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,980
而係當你講嘅時候，係唔徵税嘅。

478
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,920
其實一個噉嘅情況。

479
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:16,010
咁所以，我覺得即係你除非你話個社會，你你仲有咩特別其他嘅原則係可以蓋過呢個原則咧？噉。

480
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:17,680
嗱，我諗唔到。

481
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,140
政府講咩啊？

482
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:32,560
政府嗰個原則就係，唔係，如果你誒咁用噉嘅原則，咁分分鐘你而家誒通過咗，咁賣憲報之內，咁誒有人咪湧去誒誒做做咩啊？誒買搶搶住買樓啦噉。

483
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:36,710
即係噉，你就要諗究竟佢搶住買樓嗰個幾日？

484
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,230
係咪動搖你嘅根本？

485
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:45,890
會有幾多人會個搶住同埋幾多樓用樓嗰個市場喎？唔係買煙買酒喎？係嘛？

486
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:49,220
推點樣成交都幾多宗？你走咗幾多税？

487
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,240
同埋原本你。

488
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,560
男子操岸嘅時候，你都唔係靠嗰個税嚟到食飯㗎嘛？

489
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,880
咁所以你用呢個噉嘅例子。

490
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:05,750
係你嘅袁國強司長畀你㗎啦，定係啊呢個法律嘅分析，技術分析。

491
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:16,620
但係就好屎咯，好渣咯，好無謂咯，好唔合比例咯，就係噉嘅意思啫嘛。

492
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,780
即係你用你用你你唯一嘅論據就係咁啦，冇啦。

493
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,200
主席。

494
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,540
日落條款嗰度咧。

495
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,830
我哋要搞清楚。

496
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,710
點解要日落條款？

497
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,930
個原因咧，就因為政府話呢個係臨時措施。

498
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,970
特殊措施。

499
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:40,960
唔係永久措施，唔係中期嘅措施。

500
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,200
係應付一個特別嘅情況。

501
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,180
嗱，或者我。

502
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,640
畀阿梁議員咧。

503
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:57,480
梁繼昌員咧一個例子，佢講啱，而家暫時係應該係冇一個咧生效緊嘅日落條款。

504
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,240
但係租管咧？

505
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,030
呢個日落條款咧，係生效咗好耐。

506
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:13,590
政府會兩年，嗱記住，一般啲租約都係一兩年啦，但係政府會兩年就檢討一次。

507
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:20,640
以前幾廿年前行嘅租管係唔係會兩年就決定係咪延續一次？

508
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:26,570
即係換句話講咧，嗱當然呢個嗰陣時係英英國政府啦，殖民地政府啦嚇。

509
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:33,170
佢嘅諗法就係因為唔夠屋，咁所以咧，如果唔租管咧，就係。

510
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:41,050
啲人咧就猛加租咧就貧無立錐之地噉，咁於是咧就頂住先，噉啊配合麥理浩十年建屋計劃，當時背景係噉。

511
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:47,830
咁但係佢當時佢諗點解要租管咁？而兩年就檢到一次。

512
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,030
其實即係換句話講咧，佢係逼自己。

513
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:54,070
嗱，第一佢講明呢個性質係臨時嘅。

514
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,990
咁當然佢臨咗幾十年啦，係嘛，真係好不幸啦。

515
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:02,040
咁但係我唔希望你而家呢個係有幾十年㗎嘛？

516
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:07,380
因為你個意識唔係咁㗎嘛，但係人哋起碼佢嘅一路都話呢個係臨時。

517
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,690
如果繼續需要，就繼續立法會決議案延續。

518
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,380
但係，起碼每兩年係延續一次。

519
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,650
呢個入落條款咧，好多種方法嘅。

520
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:31,320
一種方法咧就係要正面審議啦，又講翻啦，即係立法會要夠三十一票，即係以前就可以延續，或者咧你如果設計到你話係。

521
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:47,180
自動延續兩年，除非立法會喺兩年之後嘅某一段時空，例如嗰兩個月內，立法會係以一個決議案否決佢噉啊。以前咪又係嘥一票咯咁都得㗎。你可以兩個噉樣設計，但係個意思即係係立法會。

522
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:51,130
嚟到去確認呢個效果係唔係繼續延續？

523
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:59,770
嗱，我當時我研究咧，我都覺得奇怪，因為兩年做一次，餵你租約都係一年兩年啫噉，咁即係話講咧，佢真係話畀你聽。

524
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:18,240
想話畀個民眾聽，我好有決心去供應土地。當然佢仲唔做得一件事，但係起碼你話畀人聽，你有決心啊嘛。咁而家你如果咁講咧，即係咧，你連日落條款兩年一次，你都唔敢噉，即係換句話講咧，分分鐘你連續幾年嘅好多年嘅，因為你冇供應啊嘛。

525
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:27,120
而日落條款另一個含義咧，就係強制檢討。

526
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:34,120
政府話：我又承諾你啊，我莊嚴承諾你，一年後我檢討啦。噉，咁唔檢討又點咧？

527
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,860
唔檢討係點啊？

528
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,540
噉你你即係講得俗啲，如果係叫咬佢啊！

529
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:47,010
冇啊，佢唔檢討啊，係嘛？但係有日落條款咧，就係。

530
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,000
你必定要檢討。

531
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:55,950
你必定要檢討作為一個立法嘅準則，去延續呢個雙辣椒。

532
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:02,470
嚟到有數據、有研究、有分析，當然有預期。

533
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:04,120
嗱，噉樣去。

534
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,620
作為立法延續嘅依據。

535
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,540
呢個係好嚴肅，因為你係要。

536
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:13,240
修改法律，延續呢個情況。

537
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:19,220
但係，政府當然從一個行政方便。

538
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:23,510
甚至自己根本冇料嘅心態。

539
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,890
鵬雞。

540
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,260
弱勢。

541
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:33,500
噉啊，梗係驚啦！哇，兩年嚟走嚟立法會啊，哇！而家都咁大煲啦，兩年嚟啲錢咪好大煲。

542
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,420
就咁咋嘛？

543
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,340
所以，從一個行政方面，永遠係咁諗嘢嘅。

544
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:46,400
好啦，另一另一個論據就話：，喂，會唔會炒預期喎？

545
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,310
好老實講。

546
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,580
立法會係咩組合？

547
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,420
政府有幾強勢，有幾大嘅認受性。

548
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:02,270
能夠令到個民意有幾強，去令到立法會去點樣回應？

549
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,500
呢個係互動。

550
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,330
但係，最後就係。

551
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,160
一個有魄力嘅政府，有信心嘅政府。

552
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:33,690
佢會話畀個社會聽，個社會亦都對佢可以有預期，就係如果真係需要嘅，政府一定通得過嘅。如果需要嘅，政府一定能夠駕馭到個局勢嘅。如果真係需要嘅，辣椒係可以繼續延續嘅。仲有，如果需要嘅，政府一定夠土地可以快。

553
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:34,690
快啲取消嘅！

554
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,340
就係咁咋嘛？

555
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:39,430
但係政府驚得要死啊！

556
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,880
一見到日落條款就唔制嗰啲咧。

557
01:21:44,160 --> 01:22:03,440
其實係最弱嘅政府，最冇信心嘅政府，因為佢覺得我弱到嘅程度死啦！如果兩年要嚟啦，發過一次，咁咁市民就唔知我能唔能夠過到啦。明明嗰啲係啱嘅、好嘅、識嘅英國政府啊社會嘅，都唔知過唔過到啦。就係咁啫嘛，講穿咗。

558
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,240
所以我希望各位同事明白。

559
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:11,800
日落條款唔係咁恐怖嘅嘢，日落條款。

560
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,440
如果由政府提出。

561
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,910
係表明一個決心。

562
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:27,590
表明政府嘅公地嘅決心，表明政府一定會定期檢討嘅決心，表明政府話呢個係臨時嘅措施。

563
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,340
仲有喎！

564
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:34,480
日落條款就係，例如講兩年後。

565
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:55,310
當然，我民主黨都唔同意嗰個今年就話誒幾個月後就話就話就日落啦噉。噉我我哋都覺得唔通嘅，你要起碼有一個合理嘅時間。但係嗰個時間咧，一般預計咧，你點都要強制檢討啦啩，你點都要再嚟立法會攞一次嘅授權啦啩。

566
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,380
其實就係噉嘅意思啫嘛。

567
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:03,500
咁所以，即係呢個日落條款，正正係一個試金石。

568
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,670
就睇下個政府。

569
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,450
掂唔掂啦？

570
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,920
唔掂嘅政府。

571
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,500
一定會恐懼入落條款嘅。

572
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,440
梁繼昌議員。

573
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:37,390
主席，我想綜合回應翻阿陶錦新議員同埋石禮謙議員關於日落條款嘅一啲問題。嗱，當然我講緊而家我哋審議緊嘅係第十七條第四項、第五項、第六同第七項呢四個日落條款，就並非係陶錦新議員關關於啊點樣去建。

574
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:38,000
佢話。

575
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:58,290
入落條款或者點樣去草擬一啲啊唔同形式嘅入落條款，我哋只係講緊呢四條嘅入落條款，所以咧，我頭先講嘅亦都係限只限於咧呢四個嘅誒修正案嘅內容。嗱，當然入落條款嘅做法好多款，亦都有可以話好似係阿陶錦新議員所講話。

576
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:03,520
我哋要誒強制政府去檢討呢件事情。

577
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:23,810
嗱，但係並非而家我哋講緊呢四項日落條款啊嘛。佢講嘅嘢嗱，我都知道咧。即係議會入邊嘅同事，即係喺我啊參與呢個議會工作之前咧，亦都喺好多嘅草案委員會上邊咧，都提出過好多唔同形式嘅日落條款，包括啊，當然阿陶家新議員啦。

578
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:30,570
啊！頭先啊，石禮謙議員講過啊，梁國雄議員啦，甚至啊吳偉兒議員喺個《涉聽條例》入邊咧。

579
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,840
都有提出過個日落條款。

580
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:54,320
嗱，當然，但係個結果就係咧，而家冇一條啊，即係喺香港法例入邊係一條應用緊嘅日落條款。睇翻外國例子嚟講咧，日落條款的的確確咧係喺一啲好特殊情況底下，亦都大部分係喺影響一個人身自由、人權底下一啲法。

581
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,460
法例咧，我哋係需要日落條款。

582
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:12,490
嗱，當然你睇睇個入落條款點樣去草業點樣建構咧，我哋先可以定明嗰個入落條款係咪適用嘅。咁喺呢度嚟講咧，呢四條嘅入落條款咧，我都覺得係並不適用嘅喺條草案入邊。

583
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:28,990
嗱，頭先石禮謙議員講話，喂，點解我要用我嘅價值觀去睇政府？我當然要用我自己嘅價值觀去睇政府啊！唔通我用人哋嘅價值觀去睇政府咩？我係二萬五千個選民選出嚟嘅，點解唔係用我自己價值觀去睇政府咧？

584
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:36,830
嗱，當然政府話呢一個啊特別印花税、買家印花税係一個臨時措施咧，其實。

585
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:48,130
我心底裏係唔相信呢個係臨時措施嚟嘅。其實，縱使你講咗咁多次，我都係唔相信你哋相信你哋嘅事，我係唔相信。總之，所以咧就冇入落條款。

586
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,590
嗱，呢個簡單。

587
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:51,940
好啦。

588
01:25:52,480 --> 01:26:00,450
另一方面，我會想回應議員阿凡·沙克和丹尼斯·科克斯的辯論。

589
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:11,880
About the exemption afforded to buyers of properties for minors, those children under 18, using a trust structure.

590
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:17,930
now first of all, I agree with Abraham's observation that.

591
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:23,240
All men, women, are born with equal rights.

592
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:39,570
And only is the application of rights that is different, because of course, as we all know, physiologically and psychologically, minors may not be capable of making fully informed and sound decision.

593
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,970
Now.

594
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,160
Even I've said so.

595
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,820
我 still agree with Honourable Denis Cox.

596
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,560
Committee stage amendment.

597
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:56,090
what's wrong if we use a right to address a wrong?

598
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:58,920
That wrong has been done yesterday.

599
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,680
Now, if the government,

600
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:05,050
有個 vision， to accept my own amendment。

601
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:13,920
to introduce the concept of導 missile, that you won't have to debate today. Now, of course, the concept of導 missile is difficult, is uncertain.

602
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,970
但係，係一個ablished legal concept。

603
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:22,700
那，因為條法呢度有回溯性效果。

604
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:26,260
It is only equitable that.

605
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:29,310
those minors below 18.

606
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:31,940
should be given the exemption.

607
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:40,280
for the grace period in between, if they buy property and they don't know the certainty of the legislation, they should be given exemption.

608
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:44,910
and I do not see a reason why the under EPM check that.

609
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:56,780
他cannot accept that to use a right instrument or a device to address the wrong, and the wrong has been passed and it has been done yesterday.

610
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,190
Thank you, Mr. President.

611
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:21,600
誒主席，我必須回應啊，陶景新議員對我嘅指控嘅。誒，第一咧就民建聯對於日落條款嘅立場咧，其實非常清晰嘅。如果啊陶議員有留意我二讀嘅發言咧，我哋係不認同條例草案定立日落條款，因為根本咧冇人可以預知乜嘢時候咧樓市先至回覆合適嘅時候撤招。

612
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:41,610
亦都明白咧，香港嘅樓市咧受多重嘅因素影響，所以我哋咧基本上咧係唔會支持日落條款嘅設定。我哋嘅立場咧其實好早已經講咗啦。亦都咧喺呢個時候咧，我只係希望咧多聽議員嘅意見。如果認為多聽議員嘅意見咧都係誒唔合適嘅話咧，咁呢個係不公平亦都唔合適嘅評論嚟嘅。我亦都想。

613
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:44,880
想回應嘅陶議員嗰個講法，其實誒。

614
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:54,690
誒，亦都想回應翻定日落條款誒，議員嘅一啲日期嘅一啲誒誒建議誒，正如我頭先。

615
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:15,010
講咧，二零一四年十二月三十一日點解我邀請下自由黨去去發言咧？就因為其實二零一四年十二月三十一日咧，我自己嘅判斷就係誒都幾誒，除除非真係有外圍環境嘅變化啦。如果唔係，二零一四年佢離而家其實好短嘅時間，我哋點能夠喺咁短嘅時間就能夠判斷到二零一四年？

616
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:35,020
十二月三十一日係一個適當嘅時候撤招咧。咁如果真係有外圍環境嘅變化咧，咁可能就需要用即時嘅減壓，而唔係透過日落條款去處理咯。咁當然我哋都清楚聽到咧，議員就話訂立日落條款咧，就係希望逼政府咧有個決心去做好件事，亦都咧係。

617
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:55,030
係啊！顯示啊，政府咧係誒願意咧喺嗰個時候咧再去處理呢件事。不過大家都明白啦，其實樓市能唔能夠回復常態，樓市個病係咪可以醫得好咧？我相信政府縱使好努力咧，其實都未必有誒，未必有咧係。

618
01:29:55,030 --> 01:30:15,040
可以見到誒好大，或者我哋想見到嘅預期嘅效效果嘅。畢竟誒土地供應嘅增加，如果公道啲講啊，特首呢屆誒任期裏邊確實係希望做好多嘢，但係做唔做到咧，都唔係行政機關咧嚇單獨咧可以去去去決定嘅。

619
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:35,050
就咁講改劃用地係咪？我哋知道喺啊地區方面，亦都面對唔同嘅困難。噉啊，講填海、講開發新市鎮、講發展大嶼山，喺議會裏邊、喺議會外邊，其實都面對大量嘅困難。咁要增加土地供應又談何容易咧？我哋又覺得即係二零一四年。

620
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:55,060
誒十二月三十一日，誒其實都係一個比較早嘅時間。就算二零一五年十月廿六日，噉我哋都誒覺得都係即係即係，如果有一個硬性嘅日期咧，其實就係誒令到咧誒嗰個辣椒咧，其實嗰個減辣嗰個味道咧係誒好即刻顯出咗個減。

621
01:30:55,060 --> 01:31:15,070
鹹辣嘅味道㗎啦，咁加埋正如我頭先講啦，即係樓市嘅供應確實係並非政府單獨可以努力去做而達至嘅成效嘅。噉啊，除咗土地供應，我哋大家都明白另一個外圍因素就係資金嗰個誒充裕情況啦。啊，而家睇嚟雖然話陳德林局長嚟到我哋誒財。

622
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:35,080
啲事務委員會雖然話有可能咧，就啲遊資會走嚟個市場噉，但係睇嚟而家個市又唔係。早前我哋同誒啲年輕朋友同啲記者講啊，都係話喂，而家似乎係佢都問我而家係咪入市嘅時機啊？而家啲一手盤咧嗰個誒售樓誒壓力已經開始大。

623
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:55,090
已經開始增加啦，佢哋都觀察到有啲誒好多不同嘅人都入市啦，咁所以嗯，所以其實你話由由資撤走噉，即係我又唔覺得係。咁利息正如我喺二度發言嘅時候已經講，利息香港其實冇得用呢一個工具去調節嘅。咁所以嗯，根本嗰個樓市市場咧就係實在有太多不。

624
01:31:55,090 --> 01:32:01,800
明朗嘅因素咧，去導致到究竟誒，究竟咧係誒？

625
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:22,090
究竟乜嘢時候先至係回復常態？乜嘢時候先至唔適合有呢個辣椒？咁所以，我係誒係未被説服。即係二零一四年十二月三十一號係應該加入呢個日落條款，以至二零一五年十月廿六日廿六日咧係應該要誒誒誒停止啦，有呢個相關嘅。

626
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,770
而係有呢個日落條款嘅。

627
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,010
將人魚。

628
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:39,120
主席對於當局一直係拒絕交代呢個評估額外印花税嘅客觀指標咧，自由黨係感到非常失望。

629
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:46,240
冇具體嘅評估準則，我哋點樣自又知道SSD是否達標咧？

630
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:50,430
噉樣何時SSD才可以撤銷咧？

631
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,530
美國而家都將呢個誒。

632
01:32:53,900 --> 01:33:01,320
量化寬鬆嘅政策係改變緊，我哋只係咪亦都可以一路坐喺度，然後坐以待斃啊？

633
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:09,500
今日嘅物業市場彷彿係由政策規劃，而不是市場主導，而所謂政策只係長官嘅意志。

634
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:21,510
好多投資者近日都跟我講：如果香港冇穩定嘅投資環境同埋政府嘅政策，隨時都憑長官嘅意志可以改變嘅話咧，佢哋點敢投資落去？

635
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:30,430
政府經常開外講，這啲些所謂需求管理嘅辣椒已見成效，其實呢個自欺欺人。

636
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:43,390
我唔否認喺二零一二年十月額外印花税加碼後咧，大大阻壓咗炒樓活動。不過，需知道辣椒退出後咧，樓價基本上係依然高舉不下。

637
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:54,780
根據差響物業估價署剛剛公佈去年十二月私樓售價嘅指數咧，實用面積一零七六方尺以上嘅大單位。

638
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:58,400
按年樓價仍然係微升。

639
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:02,790
零點四個百分點，即係一千分四。

640
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:15,260
實用面積咧一千零七百一千零七十六尺以上嘅中小型住宅單位咧，按年樓價升幅更去到百分之八。

641
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:20,840
歸根究底，因為政府用呢個行政手段咧。

642
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:27,930
人為地增加物業市場嘅風險，以致業主咧出售物業嘅意欲大減。

643
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:41,200
二手盤咧供應減少，加劇咗咧供不應求嘅情況。同時，港人上車或置業條件亦都同時被大大提高，不敢冒然入市。

644
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,550
令食膠大減。

645
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:50,850
市場並非係冇需要，只係被壓抑，紛紛轉去租樓罷了。

646
01:34:51,270 --> 01:35:03,820
換言之，一般真正需要置業嘅人士依然未能上車，即使香港真正需要處理嘅住屋問題仍然係未解決，故怎可能説成有成效咧？

647
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:17,800
相反，交頭談正，首當其衝就係一眾地產嘅代理，連帶裝修、清潔、保養、建材、傢俱、電器、物流運輸同埋相關嘅行業，均大受打擊。

648
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,350
相關從業員均手停口停。

649
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:31,140
地產代理業界聯席會議喺其意見書強烈批評當局推出所謂嘅辣椒，其實對香港造成三輸嘅局面。

650
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:49,550
我在此引述咧，第一書就香港物業市場同埋香港整體經濟受到嚴重嘅損害；第二書咧就香港市民喺物業市場得不到其應有嘅權益，包括上車換樓、改善住屋環境同埋投資物業嘅權利。

651
01:35:49,870 --> 01:36:06,710
第三書咧就係香港地產業同埋相關行業極度受到傷害，估計地產代理行業未來嘅將有百分之十到百分之二十嘅倒閉，亦都有百分之十到二十嘅從業員咧係會失業。

652
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:27,430
踏入二零一四年，大家都睇到咧，美國聯聯儲局咧已經多次傳出預備退市嘅消息，意味就本港加息週期即將展開。事實上，本港新造按揭嘅利率咧已經由三年前只有一釐或以下咧，升至到目前嘅二釐或以上。

653
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:38,820
近日樓價升勢有放緩嘅跡象，其實與辣椒嘅關係不大，反而係同利息嘅趨升同埋新盤嘅供應增加有關。

654
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:43,520
我哋嘅意見其實好簡單，就係政府係唔。

655
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:47,450
唔應該過度幹預香港嘅物業市場。

656
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:58,740
亦都切忌呢個繳往過剩，殃及無辜。説到底，增加不同嘅土地嘅供應，只係穩定樓價嘅基本啊方法。

657
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:03,380
李慧瓊議員咧不停咁問自由黨點解個日落條款？

658
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:23,670
誒定呢個日子咧，咁咁其實我都唔明佢點解不停咁問我，我就以為個局長問我，我或者以為佢做咗局長添。不過點都好啦，如果你既然民建聯係冇興趣支持呢一落條條款咧，問題都嘥氣嘅啫，你咪投反對啦。乜問題冇問題，大家知道大家點樣企，你係超級。

659
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:29,550
級保皇黨，噉我哋咧就係實事求是嘅黨，咁但係我亦都要話一話畀你聽咧。

660
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,470
話話畀你聽咧～

661
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:47,930
係咪你係認同啊？話話畀你聽咧，我哋建議呢個修正案咧，就係因為額外印花税加入咗日落條款咧，係可以讓物業嘅市場係有其有序地回復呢個自由市場嘅正規。

662
01:37:48,230 --> 01:38:02,530
自由黨認為咧，隨著美國退市，樓市充滿暗湧，以今年嘅年底為期咧，踏入二零一五年即告撤銷額外印花税咧，係適合不過。其實都有多過兩年嘅時間。

663
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:15,410
但係，如果屆時有任何嘅特殊情況咧，政府甚至社會上咧認為有需要延期嘅，房屋局局長可以經立法會批准後，刊憲指明另外一個撤銷嘅日期。

664
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:35,780
因此咧，李慧瓊議員，你同你啲同事咧都唔需要擔心咧。就係話誒日落咗就即係有咗日落條款，就係誒會到時就即刻真係要限時限刻就要撤銷。咁即係我相信你都會知道係點解嘅。咁咧就誒希望你因為噉。

665
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:55,790
噉啊！我解釋完咧，你又會投支持，即係自由黨呢個修訂啦，係咪？我哋係誒依然係可以因時制宜嚇，但係決定權唔係喺政府，係喺立法會，從而確保有關嘅措施咧，經大家討論後得到共識，自作決、自作定論，充分發揮立法。

666
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,990
會把關嘅角色。

667
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:03,840
所以，主席，我係呼籲各同事支持自由黨建議嘅修正案。本人僅此陳辭。

668
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,170
我明閪嘢。

669
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:18,890
主席，我知道今次係第三次發言，但係啊，李慧瓊議員咧，佢誒仲話誒提出咗一啲嘅問題啦，我都會。

670
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:23,520
努力咁嘗試去希望解釋佢聽，説服啊！

671
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:29,870
李慧瓊議員對我嗰個誒修訂嘅一啲睇法，嗱，其實簡單啲講，我再講多次就係。

672
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:49,180
今次依個法案嘅做法咧，係有三個罕見，三個罕見。第一個罕見係咩咧？就係一個有追索力嘅法例，有追索力嘅法例咧，本身已經係好罕見嘅啦。即係譬如我哋見到係一啲好緊急嘅情況，例如好似限奶令噉樣，一啲附屬嘅法例，佢係有追索力。

673
01:39:49,460 --> 01:40:09,470
呢個第一個罕見，第二個罕見係咩咧？就係一條主嘅法例，而家唔係講緊附錄附屬法例添啊，講緊一條主嘅法例草案提到上嚟，已經係先生效後審議。呢個係第二個罕見，係好少好少有噉嘅情況係誒。

674
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:12,980
誒有追索力，仲要係一條主嘅法條例。

675
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:33,910
係有追索力，呢個第二個罕見。第三個罕見係咩咧？就係喺審議呢條法案嘅過程，政府本來話佢哋嗰個嘅政策方針係一啲人係有豁免嘅，因為佢哋自己決定係改變呢個政策嘅立場，改變初衷。

676
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:45,120
而令到一啲人本來係唔受呢個法案影響嘅人，而家佢哋要受到影響，呢個第三個罕見。呢三個罕見咧。

677
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,410
係。

678
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:47,920
我相信。

679
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:52,120
從來都未試過發生嘅。

680
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:55,910
所以你話誒？喂，會唔會誒？

681
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:16,250
製造一啲好壞嘅先例，第時咧就係話有啲人就揸住呢個男子騷案，就話：喂，誒我睇過咯，本來誒我唔受影響，噉你而家過咗之後，令到我哋誒受到影響啦，又有追索力啦，咁誒係唔係第時就好多人會咁做咧？其實根本。

682
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:36,260
上唔會發生，因為點解咧？就係因為頭先我講嘅就係呢個噉樣嘅情況，呢三個咁罕見嘅情況，根本上第時我希望第時永遠唔會發生。因為點解咧？就係去翻去嗰個穩穩定性同埋確定性。頭先李慧瓊議員都講過好多次，就係佢都擔心嗰個。

683
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:44,520
市場嘅穩定性啊，誒誒會唔會誒造成混亂啊？你噉樣畀佢做法，明正正咪造成混亂咯。

684
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,060
就係正正造成好多不穩定性咯。

685
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:57,410
因為你畀佢噉樣咁罕見嘅情況，去可以噉樣改變初衷，令到一啲本來唔受影響嘅人變咗受影響喎。

686
01:41:57,690 --> 01:42:14,500
仲要係因為你同佢講話係客面，因因為豁免嘅。因為我哋我哋唔係單單睇嗰個男子錯誤，我哋仲會講埋就係你睇翻成個成個時序啦。佢不斷咁同市民講，就係話有一啲人係會受豁免嘅。

687
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:22,220
佢呢個係佢係咁講嘅，當然佢話哦呢個未未未係立法，因為可能到最後會變同樣。

688
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:29,680
調翻轉嚟講，喂！你話我而家要畀誒印花税啫，我點知最後我使唔使畀啊？

689
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:43,370
你而家條男子草案話我要畀印花税，我點知你最後過唔過到？可能最後三讀唔通過啦，變咗個個都唔使畀啦。咁同樣即係嗰個誒誒互相嗰個效應，其實已經係對沖咗。

690
01:42:43,650 --> 01:43:02,330
有啲人佢會覺得，哦，我我咪博你可能唔通過咯，我博你畀人誒否決咯，或者有啲人啊博你啊，本來嗰個誒豁免係誒話有嘅，跟住我我就誒睇下可唔可以之後改變，令到呢個豁免被取消。同樣嘅道理，但係。

691
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:04,430
個唔同咧，就係。

692
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:14,000
一啲人本來你同佢講話係唔需要交交交印花税嘅，到最後你改變咗你自己嘅政策。

693
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:17,190
放棄咗你之前同嗰啲人講嘅承諾。

694
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:37,480
就令到呢啲人咧，而家變咗要要要交要交啦。頭先陶錦新議員舉嘅例子係好好嘅，就係本來一啲人佢做嘅嘢係唔係違法嘅，你過咗一條法例追索翻佢當日以前做過嘅行為，話佢噉樣係一個違反嘅啊啊啊法例嘅行為。

695
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,390
噉樣咧，係令到。

696
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:55,450
唔單止，如果你話係刑事條例如果有噉樣嘅追索力嘅話，呢個肯定係違憲。但係同樣，雖然呢個係講緊係税務，講緊係一啲民事嘅嘅嘅事項，呢個亦都係影響係好深遠嘅喎。

697
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:01,690
所以我哋點解認為呢個追索力咧係唔能夠喺今次？

698
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:13,150
噉嘅情況之下咧，都畀政府通過咧。如果係噉嘅話，立法會嗰個功能咧係會大大咁削弱，因為我哋就要正正係保障呢啲事唔會發生啊嘛。

699
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:17,550
條條例根本上，佢一開始就話生效。

700
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:38,200
到拎到嚟立法會審議嘅時候，如果我哋噉樣都畀佢可以隨時改變嗰個政策初衷，隨時改變嗰個承諾，令到一啲本來唔受影響嘅人受影響咧，噉我哋立法會係冇盡到我哋嘅職能。所以喺呢個咁罕見嘅情況之下，我哋唔擔心話會唔會有啲好壞嘅先例。

701
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:50,290
係令到第時啲人咧個個都咁講話，揸住一條男子草案就當呢個係政府嗰個嘅立場，跟住就當呢個係法例，梗係唔會啦。因為根本上呢個係一個好罕有嘅情況。

702
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:57,510
啊，主席，啊，頭先亦都有人講過日落條款嗰個問題，我哋都好。

703
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:06,030
簡短噉樣講述下公民黨嘅立場。日落條款喺其他嘅情況同呢個情況係好唔同。日落條款咧。

704
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:26,730
誒，當我哋講緊，譬如好似設定條例噉樣，我哋知道本身嗰個條例係錯漏百出嘅。我哋知道嗰個條例本身咧係嚴重深深咁影響緊香港人喺基本法底下嘅權利，所以咧我哋就要求局方去立一個日落條款，去迫使。

705
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:36,530
喺局方咧，係過咗某一段時間之後，一定要係深入去檢討嗰個法例咧，令到佢係減少對。

706
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:47,630
香港人，減少對人民造成嘅一啲啊傷害，尤其是喺憲法上佢哋權利嘅侵侵犯。咁所以，我哋喺嗰啲情況之下。

707
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:51,340
佢要求佢做一個日落條款咧，同今日。

708
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:58,770
議員所提出嘅遊樂條款嗰個嘅情況係非常之唔同，因為而家係講緊一個税項。

709
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:10,050
要睇嗰個，當然嗰個背景就係嗰個市場嘅變化。市場嘅變化未來係點樣，冇人可以啊真實噉樣去預測到或者估計到。

710
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:25,760
同以前嗰啲情況話要誒落一個日落條款，係為咗保障喺基本法底下誒一啲人嘅自由同埋權利咧，係嗰個誒出發點咧係好唔同。主席本人僅此陳辭。

711
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,800
林大飛兒。

712
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:35,220
多謝主席。主席今早咧，你都聽過誒法律界嘅代表郭榮亨啊。

713
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,400
會計界嘅代表啊，梁繼昌。

714
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:45,600
地產界代表石禮謙多次嘅發表意見，我諗都係時候聽聽我哋呢位。

715
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,910
誒，既務實又踏實又老實嘅工業界代表。

716
01:46:51,190 --> 01:47:03,630
講幾句説話啦！嗱，既然工業界嘅代表又係老實又答實又務實，所以咧我啊必須從香港普羅大眾市民嘅角度啊去分析件事嘅。

717
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,850
啊！從香港人個心態。

718
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:10,170
香港人嘅人生觀，香港人嘅價值觀。

719
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:16,990
啊！呢幾方面咧，去分析下，到底咧呢個日落條款咧。

720
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:22,880
係有冇需要？有冇必要？或者係咪佢哋大家都希望嘅？

721
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,460
啊，主席。

722
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:28,310
好多香港人啊！不少嘅香港人，包括我自己。

723
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:29,960
一身咧。

724
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,090
唔好話一生啊，最少二三十年咧。

725
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:35,530
都係為咗。

726
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:42,770
居住或者置業咧，去奔波，去勞碌，去努力，去奮鬥。

727
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:48,560
置業咧，已經係香港人嘅人生大計中嘅大計。

728
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:52,610
噉啊！你如果想計劃人生咧？

729
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:54,830
就離唔開置業嘅。

730
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:59,340
噉你置業咧，就離唔開時間表嘅。

731
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:03,850
你個人生大計嘅目標咧，又必須要有時間表嘅。

732
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:16,540
嗱，點解咧？你要涉及供樓㗎嘛？首期啊，每個月嘅供樓啊，你個供款能力啊，你諗住打工打幾耐？做老細做幾耐啊？你個壽命幾耐咧？估下。

733
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:22,490
好多時供樓供到最後死咗一啖一啖氣之前啊，都未供完嗰層樓嘅。

734
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,190
嗱，今次呢個雙辣椒咧。

735
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,550
政府就話，因為要同樓市降温。

736
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,930
令到香港人有優先置業嘅。

737
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:34,020
需要幫佢哋接。

738
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,210
但結果個樓市大家睇到咧，一潭死水。

739
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:43,650
炒家又唔買，用家亦都唔夠膽買，點解啊？買咗怕跌啊嘛！

740
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,130
政府成日出口説呢啲辣椒啊！

741
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,310
隨時會加辣㗎！

742
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,920
呢個B.S.D啊，咩A.S.D啊，隨時會加辣㗎。

743
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,510
噉你點買啊？

744
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:11,720
政府專家嚟㗎嘛？佢成日講話先定立後審議，因為佢對市場個信息、市場個變法掌握比我哋叻嘛。成日出口説話加難，噉就更加唔教得賣。咁點啊？同個原則咪完全違背咗，自相矛盾咯。

745
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:14,210
好啦，點解有落條款咧？

746
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:16,330
正如我講。

747
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,060
人生要有計劃㗎嘛，計劃離唔開時間表㗎嘛，噉啊究竟我哋想知道？

748
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:27,010
政府成日講話呢個所謂臨時措施。

749
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:29,330
臨時到幾耐咧？

750
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:45,530
阿特斯特棒特棒咗幾耐咧？因為佢成日牙牙擦擦嘛，佢先定立後審議，佢最叻掌握市場嘅變化嘛，未預知未來嘅利率點樣升發啊嘛，個外來嘅資金幾時會湧現，幾時會走翻出去啊嘛？

751
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:52,330
個供應佢更加知啦，十年起四十七萬啊嘛，佢有曬計劃去去提高個供應啊嘛。

752
01:49:52,680 --> 01:50:01,320
家家就同供需求有好大關係㗎嘛，佢掌握曬身喺手上啊嘛，但佢知我哋唔知，咁所以我哋都應該覺得。

753
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,790
買咯，係雖然有個時間表嘅。

754
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:06,350
而且香港人咧，好得意嘅。

755
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:13,580
一層樓咧，除咗愛嚟安住之外咧，其實係佢哋咧向上流個動力嚟㗎。

756
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:15,410
香港人咧。

757
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:26,320
如果靠打份工咧，好多人靠架打份工咧，靠每年加嘅人工咧，其實追唔上物價嘅，追唔上個通脹嘅，好多時咧就係好似當樓咧係個商品。

758
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:32,490
啊！我現在兩公婆死慳死抵，供個三四百尺。

759
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:35,570
遲啲我升咗職，或者好少少。

760
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:36,780
啊！

761
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:40,850
有啲橫財，甚至乎噉啊，供個五六百尺。

762
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:43,300
啊，六七百尺，一千尺。

763
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:52,570
樓換樓，樓換樓，增值增加資產，向上流改善機會。但呢個換樓其實有個時間表嘅喎。

764
01:50:53,280 --> 01:51:03,800
唔能喺空中流過。唉，我諗住做幾多年嘢，我點樣兩個日日加班兼職做幾多份嘢，諗住搏三四年，唔唔唔娶老婆住或者唔生仔住。

765
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:07,500
諸如此類，全部有曬時間表，有曬計劃嘅。

766
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:17,330
啊，噉啊就扭換扭向上流嘅，咁即係話咧，其實我講嘅所有嘢咧，都一定有時間表㗎嘛。

767
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,610
冇時間表點做啊！

768
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:30,480
主席，你一成日提我哋啦。嗱，今晚開到十二點啦，聽日記住九點鐘啦，都一個時間表啊。啱嘛，我知道幾時起身，幾時再做勤力啲做嘢啊。

769
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:32,990
主席。

770
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:37,230
政府成日講咧，市場變幻無測。

771
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:42,830
市場個變化莫測極啊，都唔夠政治個變化莫測大啦。

772
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:49,990
政治啊，可以話一日都延長啊嘛，風雲變色啦，變數又多。

773
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:58,020
政改都有時間表啦！你試下政府推人政改，唔推個五部曲出嚟冇時間表，你估有冇成效啊？

774
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:05,380
政府十二月四號推個諮詢期出嚟，都係維期五個月諮詢，跟住有五步曲，然後落實二零一七年嘅。

775
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:11,040
普選啦，全部都有時間表做人㗎嘛，人生就一定有時間表嘅。

776
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:18,000
冇時間表做人咧，其實就好似冇靈魂嘅行屍走肉嘅，冇得計劃人生嘅。

777
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:21,150
所以咧，我其實係支持咧。

778
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:25,110
每一個措施、每個策略，都要有個時間表。

779
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,480
但呢個時間表可以定期去檢討，唔緊要。

780
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,810
隨住個市場個市場個變化。

781
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:43,090
隨住種族外來內在嘅因素，去加以調整、加以變通，但最少要畀一個期望人哋，畀一個願景人哋。譬如你話哦。

782
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:50,840
呢個呢個呢個打到成個市場一壇死水嘅辣椒，二零一五年十月廿六號做。

783
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:57,970
定啦，咁大家可以期我計咯。哦，二零一六就會飆升㗎啦，噉我話跌埋心水。

784
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:08,450
唔好諗住供樓咯，唔好做兩唔好做兩班啦，做一班算啦，唔好加班啦，唔好兼職啦。尤其我諗住二零一五年一切咗之後就會飆升，我都供唔起㗎啦。

785
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,190
噉我咪去排公屋咯。

786
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,250
排居誒等居屋咯。

787
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:20,690
點解？正正因為點解噉樣咧？你冇時間表，咪好多人去排咯。

788
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:27,090
佢排咪點解最近數字出咗啊？二十幾萬啊，排居屋、排公屋。

789
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:29,910
八萬幾啊！

790
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:41,120
係非長者嘅年青人啊，三五歲以下，其中專業人士幾萬個、四萬個屬於大學生學歷啊，因為冇冇將來啊嘛，冇期望啊嘛。

791
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:47,830
驚啊！唔知政府幾時又辣，有有啲事又唔辣，亂七八糟。

792
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:51,820
仲話讓年青人有所發揮。

793
01:53:52,690 --> 01:53:54,250
啊！各展所長。

794
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:56,090
主席。

795
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:04,390
剛才陶錦新講得好啱嘅，點解冇時間表啊？因為想掩飾政府揾唔到供應啊嘛。

796
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:08,120
掩飾政府係冇板斧啊嘛！

797
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:22,000
咪拖住先咯，拖都係拖咯，呃得日得一日咯，啊！而家個市咪好咯，冇交投啊嘛，一潭死水啊嘛，證明你唔需要，唔需要。

798
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:26,620
買樓啦嘛，唔需要買樓，唔好逼我揾供應啦。

799
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:37,770
二十四萬排公公居屋，三啊萬、四啊萬、五萬萬居公屋，有分別啫？環境都解決唔到嘛，咪變咗三啊萬咯，跟住四啊萬、五萬萬咯。

800
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,660
一個都唔多啦。

801
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,780
主席。

802
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:50,860
土地供應咪真係咁難啊？咁唔係唔難啦，新加坡大把地啦。

803
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:53,940
發展新東北，發展新㗎林。

804
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:56,180
好好方向啊！

805
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,600
不過揾唔啱人去做啫嘛。

806
01:54:59,730 --> 01:55:01,810
揾唔啱人去傾啫嘛～

807
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:05,340
聽到係劉皇發都慶曬咁解啫嘛～

808
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:09,550
點會冇地啫？打開地圖睇到曬有地㗎啦！

809
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:12,700
邊塊地可以傾，邊塊地唔可以傾。

810
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:16,120
一目瞭然㗎啦，問題你點樣去傾？

811
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:19,340
盡快釋放啲土地。

812
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:26,260
快啲起居屋，快啲嘅公屋，噉就唔使出啲辣椒去打擊呢個私人市場。

813
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:29,780
講走曬嗰啲外來投資啊！

814
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:33,860
拱去東南亞，拱去外國啊！

815
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:37,340
於事無補嘅，依然解決唔到。

816
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,370
香港人上樓嘅。

817
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,330
只係令到咧。

818
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:46,760
個公屋個條龍咧越嚟越長，直到搞到咧年青人越嚟。

819
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,860
越冇上流嘅希望。

820
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,450
主席。

821
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,730
嗰個落日條款。

822
01:55:53,320 --> 01:56:00,150
日落條款唔係落日同日落都差唔多㗎啦，啊個條款咧。

823
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:05,020
擺街引花税，李慧瓊話唔明點解喎。

824
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:16,380
喂，三十二零一二年十月二十六號推出嚟，到二零一五年十月廿六號咪三年咯，三年畀政府做仲唔夠時間啊？

825
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:19,320
唔通三廿年啊！

826
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:32,640
噉你人人哋提兩年，你又問人哋兩年點解？提一年一年點解？總有個日子㗎嘛。三年好合理啊，三年做咗好多嘢啦，啱唔啱？所以咧即。

827
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:43,460
政府咧，我希望聽聽大家意見，除咗聽法律界、會計界、地產界，聽聽佢個務實嘅工業界講幾句忠告畀聽。

828
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,520
啊，係需要定時間表嘅。

829
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,820
等到大家都有個希望，主席畀人緊住陳詞。

830
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,480
陳偉迪。

831
01:56:52,520 --> 01:57:04,890
係多謝主席。主席咧原本冇諗住發言嘅，但係頭先阿石禮謙嘅發言咧就畀咗好多嘅啊啟發同埋刺激啊。噉啊，特別佢講到佢自己係。

832
01:57:05,170 --> 01:57:25,180
即係普通人咧，即係呢一個形容詞就可圈可點。我諗啊，石禮謙議員代表嘅身份喺呢個議事堂咧，即係啊人哋美國有個Captain America，即係石石禮謙可以話係Captain Hong Kong啊，佢所代表嘅利益同埋資產。

833
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:27,210
咧係超過香港嘅一半。

834
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:47,500
咁所以佢嗰個身份係超級富豪嘅代言人喺呢個議事堂。噉啊，呢幾日即係石禮興，咪充分表現佢呢個嘅超級富豪代言人啊嗰個嘅身份，就翻呢個條例咧，即係好似編將呢個條例編絲啊，即係編到呢個條例咧。

835
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,690
咧就一錢不值。

836
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,990
馮親石，李謙反對嘅我都支持嘅，基本上。

837
01:57:52,270 --> 01:58:10,740
啊，即係因為大家階級立場唔同啊，我哋係代表小小市民，佢就代表呢個嘅超級富豪。所以當石禮謙反對嘅嘢嘅時候咧，我哋要好小心，更加留心去睇。特別佢反對政府嗰陣時咧，我哋更加要小心睇。啊，頭先佢講到公義。

838
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:14,740
即係我即刻感到，即係覺得好諷刺。

839
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:25,790
即係十八歲以下嘅未成年嘅人買樓嘅公義喺佢心目之中係大到無倫嘅。香港市民嗰個嘅選舉權。

840
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:34,480
被呢一個嘅不斷拖延，被呢一個嘅不斷呢個壓殺，呢一個公義何在啊？

841
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:37,370
Captain Hong Kong。

842
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,750
所以。

843
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:43,120
即係見到呢一啲噉嘅議事。

844
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:53,490
嘅即係水平同埋呢一啲價值嘅取向嗰種嘅選取性嘅偏頗同埋扭曲。

845
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,910
將公義。

846
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,570
嗰個嘅描述。

847
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:04,280
喺啲超級富豪代言人嘅心目之中，就係等同。

848
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:07,070
呢一個嘅金錢。

849
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:18,990
即係任何嘢影響啲富豪賺錢嘅呢一個就唔係公義，係嘛？向呢一個權貴獻媚嘅，剝剝奪香港市民嘅選舉權嘅，呢啲係公義咩？

850
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:26,350
所以唔好以公義之名，為呢個富豪謀取呢個嘅暴利。

851
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:30,220
嗱，主席講到呢一個嘅。

852
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:36,560
日落條款咧，我相信呢個議事堂提日落條款嘅修訂，冇人多過我嘅。

853
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:56,950
即係其實頭先啊林大輝講好多日落條款方面嘅論述咧，其實我一年前已經講咗好多嘅。但當時佢哋投票全部投反對票嘅，包括自由黨在內，係嘛？咁當時即係我哋提拉布嘅時候，哇！我提咗數以十計嘅日落條款，全部被否決。

854
01:59:57,380 --> 01:59:59,480
咁呢一次，我亦都。

855
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:12,710
好難支持啊！即係特別係自由黨提出嘅有關入落條款嘅條文。嗱，我從兩個嘅角度去分析。如果從條例嘅精神同埋原則咧，

856
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:19,920
佢哋絕對正確嘅提日落條款，因為政府，因為政府基本上。

857
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:25,970
係關於呢個嘅雙辣椒嘅提出咧，講明係一個嘅。

858
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:27,420
啊！

859
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:38,170
緊急或者係特殊嘅措施，因為基於呢個樓價嘅問題，佢要諗一啲嘅措施咧，去壓抑呢一個嘅樓價嘅上升。

860
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:55,950
嗱，呢個係一個嘅並非治本之道，啊！呢個係一個嘅緊急臨時嘅措施咧，喺流雨未提供足夠供應嘅情況之下咧，佢要有一啲嘅行政或者一啲一啲財政嘅措施咧，愛嚟。

861
02:00:56,230 --> 02:01:06,040
用人為嘅因素，用一啲嘅技術嘅因素咧，暫時打擊樓市嘅增長，或者係迫使去下調。

862
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:26,620
咁所以逢親係一啲臨時緊急嘅措施咧，喺呢個嘅論述上、理論上咧，理應係有個入落條款咧，係限定幾時咧？係三年、五年定係幾多年啊？因為你樓好多樓未起啊嘛。頭先林大輝議員講到樓王發樓王發發火，我都發火啦。我係樓王發發火咗十年添啦。

863
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:46,630
啊，係嘛？即係有乜理由？即係姓李嗰啲嘅土地古洞，我講過好多次啦。姓李喺古洞嘅土地一劃就劃咗，全部係住宅，咁啱嘅喎，凸凸冚嘅喎，係嘛？姓劉嗰啲擁有嘅土地全部係綠化地帶，你啲人明黑我啫，係嘛？即係唔反台就假啦，啲鄉事應該早反。

864
02:01:46,630 --> 02:02:02,320
海啦，係嘛？有乜理由啲大財團嗰啲嘅土地規劃上就特別照顧啊？鄉事嗰啲嘅土地就即係係特別呢一個嘅歧視，即係鄉事嘅土地啊，佢話你鄉情啊，有鄉情啊，所以畀翻啲綠化地帶你啊噉。

865
02:02:03,810 --> 02:02:11,500
呢個係另一個議題啦，噉啊，所以鄉事反台就係呢個嘅啊應有之義嚟嘅，呢個係。

866
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:21,400
講翻呢個嘅日落條款頭先，我提到就係話，從邏輯理論上咧，你既然係緊急措施，理應係有呢個嘅時間表。

867
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:23,060
咁但係咧。

868
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:33,650
人民力量嗰個嘅判斷同埋分析咧，呢一個雙辣椒，我哋覺得我哋贊成梁繼昌喎，呢個應該係長久永久存在嘅。

869
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:45,480
因為呢個係捍衞本土嘅利益，你唔係香港人嚟香港買樓，理應就係要畀多啲嘅啊，即係呢一個嘅税啊，畀多啲嘅印花税。

870
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:50,010
咁呢個係對香港市民應有嘅保障。

871
02:02:50,290 --> 02:03:10,300
咁所以從政策上，我哋好希望呢一個政策係永久存在，所以我哋基本上咧係反對呢一個嘅啊日落條款嘅定定咧，因為有關嘅措施咧，我哋希望可以即係永久存在。當然技術性上喺邊？

872
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:30,310
一方面或者公司方面嗰個嘅誒，即係安排啊，將來會唔會可以作修訂？嗰一段期間裡面作修訂咧，以香港人擁有嘅公司，如果某啲年期裡面佢係完全冇買賣嘅，可以退翻億嗰個嘅印花税畀佢咧。咁嗰啲嗰啲嗰啲嗰部分咧，我。

873
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:33,180
我哋覺得可以再作修訂，啊！

874
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:53,950
咁但係最好嚟講，呢個條例，正如我哋喺二讀辯論嘅時候提出咧，即係最好就唔能夠通過啦。唔唔能夠通過就好多方法啦。一個就係三讀嗰陣時反對啦，其他嘅條文投票嗰陣時反對啦，係嘛？另一個方法就開會唔夠人咧，導致到呢個條例條例咧係胎死腹中，主席點人？

875
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:28,190
現在以嚟。

876
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:31,870
嗱，主席即係。

877
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:52,260
好多人唔係好明點解人民力量一方面講話支持呢一個條例嘅精神原則，即係點解就誒用咁多方法誒，意圖阻礙呢個條例嘅通過。咁其實即係個理由好簡單嘅啫，因為呢個條例有好多嘅問題咧，係仍然存在，特別係局長同兩個大黨撕雙。

878
02:14:52,260 --> 02:15:12,270
受受達成呢個協議咧，係違反曬所有立法嘅應有嘅程序，同埋扭曲咗呢個立法嘅原意。咁所以咧，基於個原意被扭曲咧，我哋希望呢個條例咧應該係重新上翻委員會咧，就翻呢個局長啊私下同兩個大黨傾掂嗰啲嘅安。

879
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:32,280
排咧理應用文字嘅形式咧寫翻喺條例裏面啊，即係如果你係下條嘅就先修訂後審議嘅上條嘅就先呢個嘅啊審議後後修訂嘅咧，咁應該就喺條文裏面加多一個條文呢個嘅啊，即係落實。

880
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:52,290
咁透過一個嘅文字嘅確認咧，呢個係最正確嘅，因為立法唔可以私相授受，立法唔可以好似阿田北俊議員所講咧，大陸化即係共產化係嘛？咁呢一共產化係我修定你嗰個意思嘅啊，即係大陸化其實即係共產化啫。

881
02:15:52,290 --> 02:16:10,530
係嘛？一般講大陸，中國大陸就講共產黨啊嘛，係嘛？咁所以大陸化即係共產化。咁所以即係如果你將嗰個條文誒，淨係透過私生熟嘅形式咧，呢個絕對唔能夠接受。同埋我想指出一點咧，因為好多議員講呢個嘅日落條款，其實局長應承。

882
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:21,550
民建聯同埋呢個經民聯兩個行政會議成員主導嘅政黨呢一個協議咧，其實裏面係有個隱含嘅日落條款嘅。

883
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,500
唔知咧，大家。

884
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:40,620
誒石禮謙就知啦，因為佢係地產界個代表最熟悉啊。其他啲人都蒙在鼓裏都唔知，其實係有個日落條款嘅個日落條款就係局長公開講呢一個嘅承諾係引係喺現任政府。

885
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,640
都唔同。

886
02:16:41,970 --> 02:16:52,510
呢一屆係有效，但係呢個日落條款咧有好多不穩定因因素嘅，因為大家都唔知道呢個現任政府捱到幾時。

887
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:53,870
係嘛？

888
02:16:54,150 --> 02:17:06,470
話就話二零一七年啫，未必㗎嘛？呢個政府隨時落台冧台㗎嘛？喂，你點可以有一個咁重大嘅承諾、咁重大嘅政策嘅安排？

889
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:26,810
而有一個咁唔穩定嘅因素，特別喺呢個風雨飄搖嘅政府情況之下，哇！因為呢一個因素，哇，共產黨就唔炒你梁振英魷魚啊，可能都唔出奇嘅，可能裡面有啲嘅特別嘅利益喺度，係咪啊？哇，可能透過呢一個嘅承諾咧，我嚟令到呢一個政府。

890
02:17:26,810 --> 02:17:43,220
可以繼續延長都未頂嘅喎，咁呢個並非香港人嘅意願啦，係嘛？喺呢個議事堂啊，特別喺我左邊嘅林大輝都希望呢個政府快啲諗啦，係嘛？啊啊，咁呢個你自己你自己問心啦啊，咁所以所以。

891
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,090
林大輝嘢，我要求。

892
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:55,320
誒主席裁定佢剛才對我嘅無理，要收回佢剛才嘅説話，呢個事關重要啊！陳偉業。

893
02:17:55,760 --> 02:18:11,670
主席，呢個係猜測嚟啫，呢個唔係無理，即係呢個議事堂可以議事議事規則，即係唔可以揣測呢個嘅，可以揣測別係啲議員嘅助理願唔願意收翻你嘅？主席，呢個係我夢中嘅説話，我收翻主席。啊，陳偉，啊主席。

894
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:22,080
雖然我係講到林大輝嗰個嘅即係本意，不過即係呢個耳穴堂就係充滿謊話㗎啦，好多。佢繼續污衊我，呢個唔係我個本意。

895
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:39,960
我一係一定係支持特區政府依法施政，落實一國兩制。好啊，陳偉業議員。主席，我支持林大輝頭先嘅講法，佢係支持特區政府，唔係支持呢個嘅梁振英政府啊，好清楚嘅。嗱，主席就唔好糾纏呢個問題啦，講翻呢個日落條款呢一個嘅日。

896
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:46,520
呢個隱含嘅日落條款，嗱。

897
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:57,820
主席喺立法會咁多年嚟，有關嘅條例嘅通過，從未試過有個隱含嘅入落條款嘅，同埋呢個隱含嘅入落條款其實係有個法律效力嘅。

898
02:18:58,890 --> 02:19:01,750
含忍定忍忍含啊，忍含。

899
02:19:03,030 --> 02:19:23,040
主席，阿長毛似乎想我講啲不良嘅説話啊，噉就不雅嘅説話嗱。主席嗱隱含嘅日落條款其實係一個好嚴重嘅問題嚟嘅，同埋係一個好扭曲立法原意同埋立法嘅程序嘅一個嘅做法嚟嘅。

900
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:43,270
即係你點可以透過私相授受嘅形式，一個咁重大嘅政策，一個重大嘅條例喺文字上完全冇描述。除咗喺呢個議事，除咗喺呢一個嘅啊立法會啊嘅記錄喺我哋嘅憲臣裏面，即係個逐字記錄裏面咧，就會有啊。

901
02:19:43,270 --> 02:20:03,280
局長嘅承諾啦，咁但係啲人一般係睇條文㗎嘛，即係任何律師又好，任何人士又好，睇呢一個嘅有關嘅條例，睇呢個雙辣椒咧，佢係睇翻呢一個二零一二年印花税修訂條例，佢係睇個條例㗎嘛，你個條例裡面唔會將呢一

902
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:13,540
個嘅局長嘅承諾啊，同埋呢兩個大黨唔見得光嘅協議寫喺度㗎嘛，係冇㗎嘛。

903
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:26,930
你幾個月後個條例通過咗之後，當有任何嘅人要作出決定嘅時候，任何律師畀意見呢一個嘅客户嘅時候，佢係揦住個條例去作演繹㗎嘛？

904
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:38,500
除非喺呢段期間裏面有聽呢一個嘅辯論，同埋有跟呢一個嘅條例嘅朋友咧，就可能會知道有噉樣嘅隱含嘅日落條款。

905
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:54,800
但係其他嘅人士，特別海外嘅律師、海外嘅朋友啊，喺呢段期間冇關注呢個問題嘅人，係完全唔會理解，完全唔會知道有呢一個有法律性、有法律約束力嘅隱含條款喺度㗎嘛。

906
02:20:55,290 --> 02:20:56,590
咁所以。

907
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:59,090
喺噉嘅情況之下咧。

908
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,800
其實理應，理應。

909
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:22,280
呢一個嘅條例咧，應該係重新發還委員會再審議，就有關呢一個嘅唔見得光嘅黑箱作業嘅協議，再擺翻上去委員會，還翻委員會嘅專業，埋翻委員會嘅公道，還翻市民嘅公道。

910
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:41,490
特別係日後市民有啲人因為唔清楚、唔知道有噉樣嘅條文、有噉樣嘅協議，而日後受到呢一個嘅不必要嘅影響，或者唔知情情況之下咧，佢個法律權利權利咧係受到呢一個嘅傷害啊嘛。咁所以條文嘅審議。

911
02:21:41,830 --> 02:22:01,840
嘅公開性係極為重要嘅條文有關嘅法律，任何適合到呢個條文有關任何嘅法律有約束性嘅行為，都必須要以呢個嘅字面啊，以文字形式咧喺條文裡面清楚呢個嘅描述。

912
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:02,270
係。

913
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:05,020
咁所以。

914
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:08,160
即係呢個嘅誒。

915
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:28,450
日落條款，如果有嘅話咧，如果要嘅話咧，特別係局長同兩個黨達成協議嘅條文咧，必須要擺喺裏面。令我最後想講一點咧，就係我已經多年嚟指出咧，梁振英係有個陰謀嘅，要懟冧呢個樓市。當然我哋支持呢個樓市下調啦，去懟冧呢個樓市咧，等個樓市冧到啊！

916
02:22:28,450 --> 02:22:29,970
啊！即係。

917
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:50,270
啊！七國咁亂嘅時候咧，啲中資機構就會入股㗎啦嘛，就會紅色資金入香港市場，就會操取代呢個華資嘅地位㗎啦嘛，係嘛？咁所以香港呢一個嘅紅色入侵咧啊，包括啊，即係呢個以人多啊，包括以呢個啊，即係民建聯操控嘅。

918
02:22:50,270 --> 02:23:10,280
啊！好多嘅組織啊，等等咁咧啊，連呢一個嘅施君龍殺咗人嘅人都可以即係入嚟香港嘅係嘛？呢個係極端無良同埋無恥嘅做法。咁所以呢一個嘅日落呢一個嘅條例咧，雙辣椒咧，其實另一個政治陰謀咧，就係日後呢個樓市冧之後咧，香港嘅地產就會畀紅色嘅黐。

919
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:15,280
產咧係呢個嘅取代嘅，咁所以啲地產商咧石禮興咁強烈反對有理由嘅。

920
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:16,980
謝偉全議員。

921
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:20,270
誒，多謝代主席。

922
02:23:21,550 --> 02:23:28,020
誒，我首先宣佈咧，我擁有物業同埋有啲有顧問公司咧，從事呢個物業嘅買賣嘅。

923
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:30,940
主席啊，喺樓市咧。

924
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:36,920
過度亢奮嘅嘅非常時期咧，辣椒咧係有佢嘅作用嘅。

925
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:45,470
就係好似沙士嘅時間咧，我哋啲救命藥雖然服用後可能會出現一啲副作用後遺症。

926
02:23:45,770 --> 02:23:52,060
但係權衡輕重咧，喺冇其他更好辦法可施嘅情況之下咧。

927
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:54,860
亦都不得已唔執行。

928
02:23:55,770 --> 02:24:07,680
目前香港嘅防疫房屋供應咧係嚴重不足，主要嘅原因咧係過往政府並未有為房屋供應去制定目標同埋計劃。

929
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:21,360
即使政府喺近年加推土地，有意增加公私型住宅單位嘅數目，但係建屋需時，短期內根本係冇辦法係大量咁增加供應。

930
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:23,740
喺求過於公。

931
02:24:24,050 --> 02:24:27,400
利率偏低，外來資金帶動。

932
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:30,980
短期投機炒賣嘅活動咧，變得熾熱。

933
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:34,480
導致咧物業價格咧不斷飆升。

934
02:24:35,390 --> 02:24:41,270
遠遠拋離市民可以負擔嘅能力嘅情況之下咧，政府採取。

935
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:47,950
剛性嘅需求管理措施咧，以辣椒為樓市降温。

936
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:52,580
緩和呢個樓價進一步唔理性嘅上升。

937
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:59,260
喺呢種非常時期，採取非常措施，為樓市降温。

938
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:02,450
雖然。

939
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:05,890
呢樣嘢咁做法咧，對香港。

940
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:11,950
向來奉行嘅自由經濟原則咧，係會造成一定嘅衝擊。

941
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:16,370
但係，整體而言，我係理解同埋支持。

942
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:20,980
至於條例草案咧，引申出嚟。

943
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:29,810
關於應唔應該設立日落條款呢個問題咧，我覺得係確實值得我哋去。

944
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:33,670
長加考慮同埋研究嘅。

945
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:43,780
事實上，政府推出熱銷以嚟咧，市場嘅物業價格大幅飆升嘅情況已經唔再見到啦。

946
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:50,780
但係市場咧，亦都同時咧變得好淡靜，交投好低。

947
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:55,100
有好多有能力置業嘅市民咧。

948
02:25:55,640 --> 02:26:09,200
佢係除非有迫切嘅需要咧，佢而家就唔會冒然入市，因為佢哋唔想喺而家樓價高企、未來市況唔明朗之下咧去入市。

949
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:16,940
我哋亦都睇到過往咧唔健康嘅炒賣嘅活動咧，亦都明顯收斂。

950
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:21,720
呢個亦都令到物業市場嘅成交大減。

951
02:26:22,530 --> 02:26:33,160
當然，除咗買家係觀望，賣家咧亦都會考慮喺未來一段日子內，嗰啲單位供應都係仍然。

952
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:35,150
屬於偏低。

953
02:26:35,430 --> 02:26:39,390
以利息方面咧，亦都會處喺低水平。

954
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:49,580
加上呢個資金咧係充裕，令到佢哋對未來樓市唔會有太悲觀嘅睇法。

955
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:55,700
所以佢哋冇迫切嘅需要減價促銷。

956
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:00,790
咁造成咧，買家咧就唔敢買喎。

957
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:08,030
賣方咧又唔急於去出售，雙方就變成拉攏嘅局面。

958
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:12,940
所以導致咧，呢個成交嘅數量下跌。

959
02:27:13,730 --> 02:27:16,470
所以，我覺得我哋係有責任。

960
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:18,220
盡早。

961
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:20,120
完成審議。

962
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:27,360
今日有關嘅條例草案，令到市場咧就可以有清晰嘅。

963
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,820
條件之下咧，就去。

964
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:32,470
進行活動。

965
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:33,940
主席。

966
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:41,290
根據咧一間大型物業代理提供嘅統計字號字咧，本港整體嘅樓宇買賣合約啊！

967
02:27:41,570 --> 02:27:43,770
由二零一三年一月份。

968
02:27:44,370 --> 02:27:48,490
大概有八千三百宗，減到咧。

969
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:54,120
一三年十二月份，十二月份咧，只係大概有六千宗。

970
02:27:54,460 --> 02:28:08,220
當中咧二手私人住宅嘅買賣合約咧，亦都由一三年一月嘅四千三百九十九宗，下降至到一三年十二月份嘅二千四百二十八宗。

971
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:12,680
跌幅咧，其實好犀利，有百分之四十五。

972
02:28:13,730 --> 02:28:21,820
咁呢個成交量嘅減少係咪純粹因為呢個辣椒所引致咧，抑或有其他嘅因素咧？

973
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:25,390
我相信大家可能心中都有數。

974
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:31,230
但係咧，我想強調啊，物業買賣嘅成交量咧。

975
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,730
有高低。

976
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:40,160
佢好大嘅程度咧，係視乎買賣雙方咧對未來市場嘅睇法。

977
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:46,840
咁當中咧，有好多不明朗嘅因素，亦都有其他嘅考慮。

978
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:54,650
包括個利率咧，會唔會有變化咧？供應量市場上嘅資金嘅多寡咧？

979
02:28:54,930 --> 02:28:56,960
同埋政府喺政策。

980
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:00,600
嚇對樓市嘅政策等等咧，呢啲因素。

981
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:07,240
而去年咧生效有關規管售賣一手樓語嘅法例。

982
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:14,480
亦可能係影響一手住宅短期供應量嘅因素之一。

983
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:21,380
數據顯示咧，其實一手嘅私人住宅買賣合約咧，喺一手。

984
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:25,500
呢個樓銷售條例喺去年。

985
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:29,180
四月生效之後咧，就係。

986
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:30,860
減少咗。

987
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:36,230
喺二零一三年六月份咧，更加錄得。

988
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:39,210
一個月啊，只有一百零六宗。

989
02:29:39,490 --> 02:29:44,380
呢個數字係唔及過往啊幾年嘅平均嘅。

990
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,300
百分之十都唔到。

991
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,760
所以。

992
02:29:49,270 --> 02:29:59,570
我諗到，如果當初政府冇推出呢個辣招，又或者而家呢個印花税修訂條例嘅草案咧，唔獲得通過。

993
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:09,190
喺而家利率仍然偏低、市場供應量不足、資金相對仍然充裕嘅情況之下咧。

994
02:30:09,470 --> 02:30:23,760
我係擔心會對樓市造成一啲我哋唔係想見到嘅刺激同埋波動，令到短期投機同埋炒賣嘅活動再變得活躍。

995
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:37,230
令到而家似乎開始睇到呢個樓價上升嘅情況咧，其實有收斂，甚至我哋睇到係其實慢慢咁下調。

996
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:42,600
咁如果係唔通過咧，可能令到個樓價咧調頭回升。

997
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:50,240
我亦都相信，亦都幾有信心咧，有可能咧就會急速咁飆升。

998
02:30:51,160 --> 02:31:00,560
辣椒嘅失效之餘咧，我覺得市民同埋整體嘅經濟咧都會變到最大嘅受害者。

999
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:02,630
呢啲後果咧？

1000
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:06,450
我覺得我哋大家都要再三嘅考慮。

1001
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:13,610
另外，我覺得呢個法案咧，始終咧唔係呢個治本嘅方法。

1002
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:26,620
就算如果呢個法案係獲得通過，我更加希望咧，政府能夠喺各方面咧可以加快，包括增撥資源啊，增加人手啊。

1003
02:31:27,070 --> 02:31:30,620
誒，尤其是公務員咧，員方面咧，就配合呢一個。

1004
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:37,650
加建呢個房屋單位，為呢個市場咧提供充裕。

1005
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:41,020
嘅住宅單位去解決解決呢個房屋嘅問題。

1006
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:42,870
主席。

1007
02:31:43,310 --> 02:31:47,170
就喺非常時期咧，用啲短期嘅非常措施咧。

1008
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:52,720
對市民或者對市場都係有裨益嘅。

1009
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,260
但係辣椒係要清晰。

1010
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:58,180
呢個係最重要嘅。

1011
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:01,380
當中可能政府。

1012
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:04,580
係咩時間加辣？

1013
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:06,880
咩時間減辣？

1014
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:10,310
同埋乜嘢時間會撤招咧？

1015
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:14,670
事實上，政府啊推出呢個辣椒，其中一個目的啊。

1016
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:21,170
係要進一步咁壓抑投機同埋短期炒賣嘅活動。

1017
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:24,820
而家辣椒咧，其實咧已經係。

1018
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:28,530
推出咗一個一段時間嘅。

1019
02:32:28,810 --> 02:32:37,810
我哋開始睇到咧，近月發展商咧喺推出新樓盤嘅時候，為咗吸引買家，紛紛以各種優惠。

1020
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:40,540
同埋折扣嚟招來。

1021
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:42,950
例如最近。

1022
02:32:43,230 --> 02:32:55,560
推出喺東區啊，港島東區一個新樓盤咧，發展商咧其實係提供咗特長嘅成交期，有二百七十天。另外，亦都有多項嘅。

1023
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:00,590
折扣同埋優惠合共咧，達到樓價超過百分之二十嘅。

1024
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:07,740
咁由此可見咧，其實辣椒對市場或者發展商咧，都係有一定嘅影響。

1025
02:33:09,490 --> 02:33:24,120
係因應有咁少人咧關注，究竟政府係會幾時減辣或者撤招，所以咧呢個法案委員會最終係同意啊委員嘅建議咧，要求政府咧喺法案中咧加入日落條款。

1026
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:33,740
主席，我喺開始發言嘅時候已經講過，係我係同意同埋支持政府喺非常時期採取非常措施。

1027
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:35,740
但係，我亦都認為。

1028
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:42,330
政府應該為呢個撤招咧，定下一啲客觀嘅因素。

1029
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:50,790
例如政府喺咩時間同咩因因素、咩條件之下，會考慮啟動撤招嘅安排咧？

1030
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:54,210
呢啲因素同埋條件。

1031
02:33:54,490 --> 02:33:58,990
我覺得可能包括樓價下調至到咩水平？

1032
02:33:59,270 --> 02:34:02,490
樓宇供應達到乜嘢嘅數量？

1033
02:34:02,770 --> 02:34:12,980
按揭利率又升到咩水平？空置率又增加到幾多咧？以及或者成交量去跌到邊個水平等等？

1034
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:19,860
政府係應該要向市民同埋呢個市場有一個清晰嘅交代。

1035
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:22,610
使到大家咧有心理準備。

1036
02:34:22,890 --> 02:34:25,660
更加可以有所適從。

1037
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,850
知所進退。

1038
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:33,260
我真係希望局長咧喺呢方面咧，可以有個清楚嘅交代。

1039
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:35,100
主席。

1040
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:40,550
對於議員建議喺法案中加入日落條款呢個修正案。

1041
02:34:40,830 --> 02:34:43,490
定明呢個撤招嘅日子。

1042
02:34:44,350 --> 02:34:45,350
我認為。

1043
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:51,780
係唔恰當嘅，因為冇人會知道，亦都唔可以準確咁預示未來啊！

1044
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:57,360
究竟係咪今個年底，亦或明明年底？

1045
02:34:57,640 --> 02:35:01,760
係取消呢個辣椒最適當嘅時候咧。

1046
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:10,740
但係無論如何咧，我對於政府唔考慮為呢個辣椒去説明一啲適切嘅。

1047
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:12,580
日落條件咧？

1048
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,600
我係感到非常失望嘅。

1049
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:18,230
多謝主席。

1050
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:20,350
細細影。

1051
02:35:21,230 --> 02:35:21,980
直接。

1052
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:23,060
誒。

1053
02:35:23,340 --> 02:35:43,350
關於郭榮亨嗰個誒誒修訂咧，我哋聽完誒佢個佢個意見，雖然係佢係支持咗誒政府嘅修訂咧，但係佢做一件，即係而家佢更正翻呢件誒喺個最艱難嘅期間，即係政府呃咗好多人嘅時間。

1054
02:35:43,350 --> 02:36:02,000
喺度咧，佢係雖然係錯嗰度咧，去尋求翻個真理喺度咧，我哋係支持你嘅。我哋傾完啦，我哋會畀我哋個個票畀你咧。希望咧，嗰啲苦主咧，即係相信政府嗰啲去買樓嗰啲咧，就而家可以有個機會翻身。

1055
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:22,670
另外咧，主席，我唔知唔知應唔應該多謝阿阿阿陳偉業議員咧，佢咁用用咁咁輕嘅字眼，我佢咁慈悲地咁去批評我，又冇鬧到我係咩咩狗，好似佢用啲用鬧啲官狗官啊噉。

1056
02:36:22,670 --> 02:36:34,280
噉樣樣嘢，哇！噉佢對對我都有少少愛心嚇，但係佢話佢又畀到我一個新嘅名稱，話話我係Captain Hong Kong，我又好多謝佢。

1057
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:40,870
我唔知應唔應該回翻個禮畀佢咧，叫佢做Captain Vancouver噉。

1058
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:55,760
點解captain recover咧？即係好似話人在草草營，草營心在漢。佢咧佢人在香港，愛心就冚𠰤喺温哥華，所以佢要倒壘香港嘅市場。

1059
02:36:56,180 --> 02:37:01,920
嚇！咁咧就大大聲聲，中意講嘅嘢就可以講。

1060
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:22,210
我哋而家講緊落日落條款，佢就話自由黨哇邏輯好應該要有嘅噉，突然間咧佢話依個係我講時講，而家佢又又又唔跟住佢個講個邏輯喎，佢話喂政府講嘅嘢已經係有引暗即係呢即係有噉樣。

1061
02:37:22,210 --> 02:37:40,200
誒，Latin即係隱形嘅誒日落嚇。含隱，我唔想用嗰個字，含隱嘅字。咁有個已經有個日有個含隱嘅意思喺度，會有日落條款啊咁去講乜嘢啊？我哋喺呢度講咗咁多，佢琴日又投票投票。

1062
02:37:40,890 --> 02:37:42,120
反對。

1063
02:37:42,770 --> 02:37:44,460
政府個承諾。

1064
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:53,270
佢今日又話有依樣嘢，第二樣嘢，佢又話阿田少講話要國家化咗香港啊！

1065
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:58,120
喺《基本法》第五條啊，人哋講明㗎。

1066
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:07,740
國家嗰個政策咧唔會落嚟香港，我哋香港係用一個資本主義社會，係五十年不變嘅，我哋嘅生活。

1067
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:16,350
所以佢又講咩？佢就咧就想咧，就轉基本法去轉細個基本法㗎。佢要帶嚟咧一個階層鬥爭。

1068
02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:25,000
要令到香港係變咗嚇一個社會主義，佢哋中意個啱嘅唔緊要，香港係自由港，任佢點講。

1069
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:31,840
但佢又冇邏輯，噉啊！佢話石禮謙，你代表地產，你冇權講。

1070
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:52,160
講公義，公義係每一個人都有㗎。有錢係有，冇錢係有。點解有錢就罪？點解阿阿佢喺屋佢喺加拿大買有錢買嘢就唔係罪咧？點解佢可以做佢做嘅嘢？一個一個正當嘅生意人就唔可以做啦？點解石禮謙喺度叫希望？

1071
02:38:52,160 --> 02:39:05,590
即係我哋，佢話佢話支持政府嘅精神，要令香港人買啦，買翻香港樓。我哋都支持㗎，只係就係我哋唔希望喺依個咁非常時期，香港人因為用一間公司買唔到樓。

1072
02:39:05,870 --> 02:39:25,880
咁喺度，即所以佢冇邏輯嘅。佢講嘅嘢靠大聲，完全咧。佢話石禮謙講嘅嘢我就反對。誒，我啱啱睇翻嗰個投票嗰個嗰張紙嗰度咧，佢原來佢支持咗我嘅修訂嘅喎。琴日真係好笑，佢即係佢嗰啲係即係左手不知右手知，頭同埋個腦咧。

1073
02:39:25,880 --> 02:39:36,150
即係即係即係即係口同埋個腦咧係唔搭嘅，主席。所以咧，我好希望咧，即係佢平時講嘢好喺出唔喺呢個議會講嘢好有邏輯。噉佢就話。

1074
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:53,720
生意佬冚唪唥衰㗎啦，噉我又明白點解有時佢又同阿生意佬傾下偈、食下飯啦，唔好講一套做一套啊！每一個人都有個權，每一個人喺依個權行使嗰陣時，唔令佢係有錢冇錢。基本法廿五條。

1075
02:39:54,000 --> 02:40:14,010
阿阿陳議員，你唔喺度，係香港永香港市民喺法律上係平等嘅《基本法》五條。我哋喺一個資本主義社會都係好清楚就喺度，所以一個一個咁高質素嘅議員，一個Captain Vancouver。

1076
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:34,020
嚇，Captain Vancouver夠膽企喺度講啲批評人批評係唔緊要，你你口做好似我係因為哇，佢話我係少人，但我係少人，我係代表地產界。如果佢覺得係嘅，我冇話到我唔係代表地產界，我又冇話到佢要做你林陳偉業做嘅嘢啊！你講嘅嘢，我有時知。

1077
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:54,030
支持㗎，你講啱咪支持，你講錯我咪唔支持咯。好似佢琴日講，忽然間佢良心發現，佢支持咗我個修訂喎，哈好笑喎嚇。噉佢有時佢都有一點即係嚇個人都唔係壞得咁犀利嘅嚇，佢就要攞票，攞票唔係噉嘅。而家我哋爭取十八歲以下都有翻呢個權。

1078
02:40:54,030 --> 02:41:03,960
買唔買樓唔緊要啊？點解點解佢哋冇咗呢啲權咧？佢話唔得，地產發發地產代表唔可以講呢樣因啊！佢冇依個資格講呢樣嘢。

1079
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:24,250
資格，佢自己又去買間樓，佢又用公司去買咗間樓，買一間樓就去做佢個嗰陣時同鬱敏地一齊㗎，買買完間樓唔夠幾年就賣咗間樓啊！佢有冇炒樓啊？佢又有依個權啊？點解第啲人就冇啊？而家好多，而家好多好多。

1080
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:44,260
議員啦，係有有公司揸住間樓㗎，局長用個公司揸住間樓，佢就反對有啲而家香港永久居民用間公司買樓。實情佢有個利益衝突。如果佢反對我個建議咧，有個利益衝突，因為佢而家咧點解啊？因為人哋就唔可以用公司買，如果要可以買，就畀十五個percent。但係而家。

1081
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:55,960
啊！佢哋反對嗰啲咧，就令到啲人想用公司買都買唔到。噉佢揸住幾間間公司咧，可以賣公司，咁已經賺咗十五個percent㗎。所以唔知依個係咪利益衝突，我唔知啊。

1082
02:41:56,610 --> 02:42:11,520
嚇！依個好緊要嘅啊，陶錦新都揸住個啊匯標啊嚇，啊啊，頭琴日啊啊邊個啊有幾個？而佢哋啲員都話佢有噉嘅樓喺度啊，所以唔好有口話人，冇口話子。

1083
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:12,970
決。

1084
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:21,400
公義個個人都有，權係基本法賦予畀我哋嘅，我哋有。關於日落條款啊！

1085
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:33,070
我而家想講講關於日落條款啊，因為好仲未未開始講，或者唔夠講一陣間先禁標啦，主席啊，咁畀翻聽第二個第二個人講翻，唔好阻住人啊，多謝主席。

1086
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:35,080
啊，田北俊言。

1087
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:42,860
啊，主席。

1088
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,960
石禮議員，你就冇咁興啦。

1089
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:50,120
一慶咧，日日都慶㗎啦！啊，呢度有篇係贊你喎。

1090
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,960
我啱喺度睇。

1091
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:53,490
今日咧。

1092
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:56,030
星島有篇來論。

1093
02:42:56,380 --> 02:43:06,750
指住舔笑話，我阻住呢個法例過，叫轉頭贊緊阿石禮謙，話石禮謙咧話代表地產商啊，話拖下去冇好處。

1094
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:10,300
呢篇來論咧，分明就係張局長啊！

1095
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:13,240
唔喺立法會度回應我哋啲。

1096
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:17,550
説話，我就覺得呢篇嘢啊，係特首辦寫出去嘅。

1097
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:20,340
個筆名叫金鐘仁。

1098
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:41,090
講得幾好㗎！講到我就嚟唔使申報利益㗎啦。佢話石禮軒又代表大地產商，話我咧同一個中型地產商有啲私交喺度益緊佢，跟住話得我仲好話我係小型地產商，咁最好啦。可能我係小型地產商，我就冇乜利益仔申報啦。啊，我以前都批評過少少。

1099
02:43:41,090 --> 02:43:46,180
少錢見又冇乜事㗎嘛，咁少少地產商應該冇乜事啦，係咪咁講咧？

1100
02:43:46,630 --> 02:43:47,560
主席。

1101
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:51,310
今日成個講法，關於呢個日落條款。

1102
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:56,620
我哋係接見咗好多中產人士，好多地產經紀。

1103
02:43:57,340 --> 02:43:59,300
喺呢個辣椒入邊咧。

1104
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:02,310
最受損害嘅就係中產。

1105
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:04,710
最受損害嘅咧。

1106
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:06,940
亦都係。

1107
02:44:08,130 --> 02:44:10,480
中產嘅啊經紀。

1108
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:13,520
嗱，我雖然係小型地產商。

1109
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:15,190
我都留意到啊！

1110
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:17,250
大型地產商。

1111
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:18,630
嘅運作。

1112
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,320
其實同我哋一樣，只不過係大幾廿倍啫嘛。

1113
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:25,700
即係好似我哋成日打嘅比喻。

1114
02:44:26,010 --> 02:44:30,920
就係做地產咧，就好似做麵包，你而家買咗麵包、麵粉翻嚟。

1115
02:44:31,570 --> 02:44:33,450
就整多個麵包出嚟啦～

1116
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:38,400
咁最弊咧，就係做麪粉變麵包，可能啊！

1117
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:43,060
一兩日幾個鐘頭焗得熟，但你地產咧買塊地翻嚟。

1118
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:47,070
要變咗做陳友咧，閒閒地五年嘅。

1119
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:52,850
咁呢個週轉期咧，就可以貴嚟貴去就平嚟。

1120
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:54,400
平去。

1121
02:44:55,060 --> 02:45:02,900
你話而家嘅地產商係呢排，謝偉全都都議員都話啦，啲地價係平咗啲。

1122
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:05,410
梗係啦！我都識計數啦～

1123
02:45:05,690 --> 02:45:09,900
而家啲嘢我平啲賣咗出去，攞筆錢啊！政府買塊地畀我哋啊！

1124
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:14,270
仲平喎，就嚟而家市區政府招標啲地啊！

1125
02:45:14,550 --> 02:45:22,240
五六千蚊一尺買到，以前五六千蚊啊買到去將軍澳嘅，而家將軍澳咧可能跌到去三四千蚊。

1126
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:23,700
當然結。

1127
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:26,760
建造費貴咗，係另外一件事。

1128
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:30,230
但係從呢個邏輯嚟講咧，辣椒。

1129
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:50,810
從石禮軒元代表嘅大地產商或者中型地產商，地產商角度講係冇乜所謂嘅。呢塊地嚟得貴，我就賣貴啲。而家調轉頭，我塊地啊要賣翻平啲，對唔住，我層樓要賣翻平啲出去先。但係積翻塊地啊，賣平好多嘅喎。

1130
02:45:50,810 --> 02:46:05,290
所以地產商，我啊覺得得咧，就冇賺多咗，或者賺少咗。年年計數會嘅，而家辣椒一齣嚟，啲樓唔賣得，可能佢係賺少啲。但佢減咗價賣咗出去。

1131
02:46:05,630 --> 02:46:10,820
比起兩三年前佢買翻地嚟，或者四五年前買翻地嚟，唔係啊！

1132
02:46:11,180 --> 02:46:15,450
是，只不過賺少咗，但係調翻轉頭嗰塊地賣入平翻。

1133
02:46:15,730 --> 02:46:20,090
第一個條數，第一個最傷嘅咧，就普羅大眾啦。

1134
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:40,780
政府嘅資料都顯示到啦，九成幾嘅樓啊係喺私人嘅業主手度，都唔夠一成啊喺咩發展商啊或者地產商度。而家冇成交嘅就係二手樓，二手樓咧就全部㧬出去就冇人要。點解咧？即係幾樣嘅辣椒，有啲咧就係要揸夠六個。

1135
02:46:40,780 --> 02:46:44,370
個月就可以畀少啲税，揸夠兩年就畀少啲税。

1136
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:48,180
嗱，嗰邊咧就係外來人士，就要畀十五個税。

1137
02:46:48,460 --> 02:47:00,870
所以變咗啲二手樓就全部唔賣得，所以中產啊就好多同我哋自由黨投訴。喂，呢個辣超咧就好似害唔到地產商，佢一手攞平啲賣出，仲攞我二手樓啊！

1138
02:47:01,270 --> 02:47:06,570
壓低啲，咁個二手樓壓低啲，更加冇人成交喎。點解咧？

1139
02:47:06,850 --> 02:47:08,210
嘅地產經紀。

1140
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:15,970
去揾食嘅過程中，緊係從啲地產商一下湧出二三百個單位，四五百個單位。

1141
02:47:16,330 --> 02:47:26,710
佢同你推銷啦！你畀我一層樓，我同你做咁多功夫，買嚟買去都買得嗰一層樓，收得幾多傭啊？所以啲地產經紀喺二手樓。

1142
02:47:27,470 --> 02:47:29,900
去推銷咧，更加係。

1143
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:33,900
所以政府自己都承認㗎，呢兩年辣椒生鬧之後啊。

1144
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:38,120
嘅地產嘅成交啊，成交唔係嘅價錢。

1145
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:42,240
嘅成交樓跌咗八成，喂！如果樓價跌咗八成咧？

1146
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:51,520
就政府，我諗都唔想嘅，係嘛？但係調翻轉頭，而家成交量大跌八成，咁政府初初個願意。

1147
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:53,450
就係為咗辣椒。

1148
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:59,100
可以令到啊，普羅大眾冇樓嘅人買到樓啊嘛！

1149
02:47:59,380 --> 02:48:01,400
咁而家情況係唔係先呢兩年嚟？

1150
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:04,590
呢兩年嚟冇樓嘅仲係冇樓喎。

1151
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:16,400
點解咧？因為個業主啊，即係二手樓嗰啲業主啊，唔肯降價，成交量成交量從一萬跌到來二千，嚇有二千係買到啦，仲有個八千係買唔到嘅。

1152
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:20,600
咁買唔到嗰啲，就問你政府啦，你幫到我咩啊？

1153
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:23,750
幾年後一樣嘅情況嘅啫喎。

1154
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:29,540
咁如果而家我哋呢個日落條款講緊政府初初嘅措？

1155
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:42,890
嘅政策目標啊，好似啊張局長，不過嗰次佢就冇口頭承諾啦。佢哋計劃就係呢兩年賣出嘅地，五六年後咧一定有啦，六萬個單位，七萬個帶嚟。

1156
02:48:43,310 --> 02:48:45,290
噉嘅價錢。

1157
02:48:45,610 --> 02:48:57,570
就一定落，因為貨多啦嘛，夠用啦嘛，就唔使追啦嘛。如果就算用你嘅邏輯，噉係咪你唔中意入落條款兩年或者三年，你都可以有個入落條款？

1158
02:48:57,850 --> 02:49:01,290
五年㗎！你嘅政策竟然話我而家推咁多地出嚟？

1159
02:49:01,860 --> 02:49:05,920
五六年後一定起得好嘅，所以喺現屆政府。

1160
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:26,260
完結之前，即係二零一七之前啊，可以起到呢度六萬七個單位，嗰度私家樓咧又起到四萬幾嘅單位，每年啊私家樓有二萬個單位啊，可以起得成嘅。如果係噉，噉你邊個信心啊？擺個入落條款啦，你可以自己建議㗎。我要入落五年，因為我五年啊。

1161
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:30,380
先可以令到個市係去到一個合理價。

1162
02:49:30,770 --> 02:49:32,500
謝偉全議員都問嘅。

1163
02:49:32,780 --> 02:49:37,340
你呢個條款，如果係做嘅話，咩叫做合理價咧？

1164
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:42,490
政府都可以畀市民有一個期望㗎。你要喺個市區啲樓賣到二萬蚊一尺。

1165
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:45,650
太貴，噉你政府咪話咯？係咪一萬蚊合理啊？

1166
02:49:45,930 --> 02:49:48,800
噉你一萬蚊合理，你咪話咯嗱，到一萬蚊咧。

1167
02:49:49,350 --> 02:49:50,540
我就撤銷啦。

1168
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:56,320
但係掉磚頭點解呢樣嘢做唔到啊？就係因為政府喺成個機制。

1169
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:58,480
喺推地出嚟嗰陣時。

1170
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,300
都係得一個方法，就係攞出嚟。

1171
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:03,110
投標或者拍賣。

1172
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:11,280
咁投標同拍賣過程中咧，市民包括立法會啲泛民議員都覺得公平公正嘅咧。

1173
02:50:11,560 --> 02:50:15,540
就高價者得喎，唔通你仲想好似內地十幾年前？

1174
02:50:15,820 --> 02:50:28,010
只知我係邊個咧？嗰塊地係我嘅。而家內地都唔得啦！而家內地所有啲地啊，都攞出嚟掛牌，個個啊都要公平公開啊，公開拍賣攞到。咁如果你用噉嘅制度做？

1175
02:50:28,330 --> 02:50:29,730
拍埋得一塊地。

1176
02:50:30,010 --> 02:50:35,260
係咪？梗係最貴嘅得啊！唔通你夠膽話哇？你買到一萬蚊一尺嘅地價？

1177
02:50:35,650 --> 02:50:50,860
股元你起六七千蚊，到時你賺未賣二萬，噉啊樓價到二零一七都唔會落㗎。對市民嚟講都係買唔到樓㗎。噉你夠唔夠單位？而家啲地我就唔係高價者得，招標下個禮拜啟得都有幾塊出嚟㗎啦。

1178
02:50:51,310 --> 02:51:11,320
唔攞出嚟話高價者得啊！喂，二三二三千蚊尺最低價得啊？哇！我諗香港冇人接受呢樣話。噉樣啲麪粉係貴嘅，幾年後加埋建築費嘅麵包又點會平咧？嗱，我唔敢可以話局長，你係咪喺度誤導緊市民？嗱，將嚟有平樓賣呢個講法。

1179
02:51:11,320 --> 02:51:18,460
將嚟可能經過通脹啊、剩啊，咁可能將嚟啊，五年後二萬蚊一尺唔係貴，我又睇唔到而家啲市區樓。

1180
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:25,790
點可能係照而家買嘅地價，將嚟啊會得有一萬蚊嘅樓可以畀我哋啲後生仔？

1181
02:51:26,570 --> 02:51:36,340
所以關於個入落條款咧，我哋都覺得，如果政府係冇信心嘅，你當然唔可以落啦。咁即係所有啲嘢咧，就唔係話口頭承諾係口頭。

1182
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:37,620
噏住先。

1183
02:51:37,910 --> 02:51:48,450
啊！而家有咁多地喺度啦，到時起多樓出嚟咧，幾年後就大把樓喺社會度咧，就樓價一定會得跌或者平穩。

1184
02:51:48,740 --> 02:51:55,320
但係調翻轉頭，如果你真係咁講嘅話，呢個辣椒再實施多幾年，我相信香港嘅中產。

1185
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:04,500
特別係二手樓嗰邊，想樓換樓嘅過程中，買出買入啊，你畀唔畀税，我畀唔畀税啊？又賣畀內地嗰方面咧。

1186
02:52:04,930 --> 02:52:06,530
係大有問題嘅。

1187
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:13,920
主席，另外一樣嘢，因為呢個日落條款，你同內地朋友買樓嗰十五個percent有關係嘅，我都想講講。

1188
02:52:14,430 --> 02:52:16,980
呢個同我哋而家最近遊客嚟香港。

1189
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:19,530
多唔多？香港市民。

1190
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:24,320
有冇反感？遊客係咪應該設個上限？

1191
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:27,230
或者遊客嘅增長要設嘅上限咧。

1192
02:52:27,570 --> 02:52:29,060
都係息息相關嘅。

1193
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:35,860
我會覺得，如果我哋而家香港人仲係有噉嘅諗法啊，或者好似。

1194
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:46,730
即係今日嗰個來論啊，嗰位金鐘人，我認為係特首辦公廳放出佢嘅筆名咧嘅講法，就嘅市民再咁分化落去。

1195
02:52:47,010 --> 02:52:49,520
就係話對外內地嘅朋友。

1196
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:51,800
遊客又有噉嘅睇法。

1197
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:55,920
買樓又有個睇法咧，我覺得呢個係好唔健康嘅。

1198
02:52:56,260 --> 02:53:02,090
從中央政府嘅角度講，緊係香港希望中港啊和諧啦。

1199
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:12,420
內邊入邊幾多省市嘅領導覺得中央政府對香港呢度都特別好㗎啦！呢度遊客畀你咁多，ship咧又畀咁多優惠你。

1200
02:53:13,020 --> 02:53:21,210
調翻轉頭去揾咁多人嚟買你香港啲房地產嚟香港投資，調翻轉頭咧，你香港個意見多多，我遊客太多喎。

1201
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:30,600
跟住咧，就話你買樓嗰啲又加你十五個percent税。如果咁做落去，呢個噉嘅印象啊，喺內地就會咧形成。

1202
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:32,320
你香港人。

1203
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:34,000
就一係唔歡迎我。

1204
02:53:34,580 --> 02:53:37,450
一係咧，就歧視我。

1205
02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:44,880
但係呢啲噉嘅印象，我會覺得如果有咗，將來想扭轉翻嚟，就會得非常難嘅。

1206
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:47,860
如果我唔正式處理呢樣嘢，

1207
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:52,190
從遊客又好，從呢個買地嘅税又好。

1208
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:54,480
外國人啲錢。

1209
02:53:55,080 --> 02:54:02,450
就可以，對唔住，內地人啲錢就可以畀外國㗎啲人吸去嘅。我哋作投資嗰啲係知道嘅。

1210
02:54:02,990 --> 02:54:07,670
而家幾多內地朋友？因為你香港有十五個percent嘅税。

1211
02:54:07,970 --> 02:54:19,840
而家你睇睇倫敦、紐約，其他啲冇講佢啊，幾乎我哋去睇親乜嘢盤啊，個對手都有個內地朋友喺度睇，而且對我哋嚟講。

1212
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:21,230
最。

1213
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:25,450
突出一點，就我哋傾到差唔多埋牙嗰陣時咧。

1214
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:30,810
人哋個盤賣咗啦，賣咗畀邊個啊？原來一個大陸嘅朋友。

1215
02:54:31,090 --> 02:54:35,940
總之佢加你幾百嘅啫，佢又唔加得你多。你傾緊乜㗎？總之佢加啲咧。

1216
02:54:36,220 --> 02:54:37,620
就即刻攞咗去。

1217
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:57,910
do diligence即係去睇嗰啲文件都唔使睇啦，因為你香港啲投資者叻啊嘛，你香港啲投資者請啲律師啊、會計師睇過曬，傾傾下咧，佢就出多啲錢少少就買咗佢。噉佢覺得英國歡迎佢，New York歡迎佢，倫敦歡迎佢。當然我都知道而家。

1218
02:54:57,910 --> 02:55:01,530
温哥華咧都開始出緊啲問題啦，啊話呢幾年嚟啊～

1219
02:55:01,810 --> 02:55:04,810
內地嘅移民啊，温哥華。

1220
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:12,840
去得太多啦，就開始啊啊接觸，咁即係外國係有呢啲噉樣樣嘅政策去接觸，或者。

1221
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:22,000
唔好用歧視啦，截住內地啲投資者。但係我哋喺呢個一國兩制嘅概念之中咧，我覺得呢一樣嘢係要小心處理嘅。

1222
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:29,290
如果從一個高層次嘅政治嘅講法，如果社會上越來越對個一國兩制行行開。

1223
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:32,530
即係分開咧，係對香港好唔好？

1224
02:55:32,810 --> 02:55:35,000
香港人而家就見到內地。

1225
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:38,380
遊客又好，買奶粉又好，買嬲又好。

1226
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:45,120
好大抗拒，全部講到去兩制，特別係誒泛民一位議員都唔喺度。

1227
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:47,550
泛民咧就全部係兩制曬。

1228
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:50,750
呢邊咧好多我哋喂提翻了。

1229
02:55:51,030 --> 02:55:58,650
一國啊！我諗最好嘅咧就個一國兩制入邊要小心處理。如果我哋呢個日落條款，政府唔～

1230
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:19,150
唔考慮，特別係當然內地嗰十五個percent，人哋就會都話啦。如果你係非常時間嘅非常措施，上海、北京而家買樓都有啦。但係人哋嘅非常措施係非常之有有膽撤銷嘅，因為政府喺入邊啊揸得準。我幾年後真係起到咁多樓出嚟，所以咧我啲非常措施你唔係。

1231
02:56:19,150 --> 02:56:39,160
上海户籍嘅你唔準嚟買買咧，就要加咩嘢？佢有信心做得幾年後啊，就唔做嘅。但係我哋咧就反為對呢一點就唔敢表個態。我覺得呢一點咧政府要再諗諗，所以自由黨係支持一個條款。但係當我而家講講下又嘥氣嘅，因為講咗嚟都十四個月啦。初初我哋話兩年。

1232
02:56:39,590 --> 02:56:51,860
入落即係廿四個月，而家去都去咗十四個月啦。咁如果你話再入落一年咧，亦都冇乜意思。再同政府講係咪入落條款兩年、三年咧？照而家政府最新嘅建議，就係作出咗個承諾。

1233
02:56:52,140 --> 02:57:12,150
當要加咧，就經過我哋議會度傾減咧，佢自動減咁即係話佢嘅意思咧。局長可能表達就係我唔需要有入落條款，即係減嗰陣時，我隨時減得嘅。我亦都唔需要你擺個兩年嘅入落條款，我可能一年零十八個月，對唔住一年零誒九個月，我已經可以減啦。

1234
02:57:12,150 --> 02:57:32,160
啊，或者咧，我兩年定幾個月又減得，亦都唔需要啊，五年六年，我隨時減得。噉我希望啊，呢個係政府嚟做，但係呢一樣嘢仲有一啲時間我要講埋啦，就正正係造成啊市場啊不明朗，市場不明朗咯，就係因為正正啊睇住政府竟然係隨時可能減，我咪等你。

1235
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:40,080
減咯，你冇入落條款嘅，但你中意減就隨時減。噉我哋等待政府嘅好消息，希望你聽日就減啦，我請問主席。

1236
02:57:40,550 --> 02:57:41,770
盧偉國議員。

1237
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:55,080
代主席，正如本人先前發言嘅時候強調，有關各方面喺深入討論條例草案嘅各項修訂嘅時候咧，必須同時兼顧法理情。

1238
02:57:55,360 --> 02:57:57,300
有所平衡同埋取捨。

1239
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:01,680
本條例草案所訂立嘅各項需求管理措施。

1240
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:07,060
畢竟係屬於非常時期嘅非常措施，屬於特事特辦。

1241
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:12,880
實施時間係唔應該過長，唔應該演變成為特事長辦。

1242
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:14,850
否則就過猶不及。

1243
02:58:15,130 --> 02:58:22,090
會損害香港嘅自由經濟運作，導致市物業市場咧係受到過度嘅規管。

1244
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:26,750
本來希望幫助港人置業，結果可能適得其反。

1245
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:47,090
有不少意見認為，政府應該制定撤回有關措施嘅計劃，並且設立客觀同埋可以量化嘅目標指標，以釐定何時撤撤離咧係有關嘅措施，提高決策嘅透明度。

1246
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:51,310
但係，當局就認為唔容易做到。

1247
02:58:51,910 --> 02:58:55,410
現實上，市場經濟複雜多變。

1248
02:58:55,820 --> 02:59:00,810
係唔容易以量化嘅方式準確估計同埋掌握嘅。

1249
02:59:01,250 --> 02:59:10,820
不過，即使美國退市啊，都可以事先張揚，都可以有定立啟動退市嘅具體指標。

1250
02:59:11,930 --> 02:59:13,590
喺噉嘅情況之下。

1251
02:59:13,880 --> 02:59:20,570
我都認為訂立入落條款不失為一個實際可行嘅辦法。梁君彥議員嘅修正案。

1252
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:32,190
建議定明額外印花税同埋買加印花税咧，喺二零一五年十月廿六日午夜到期，可以提高政策嘅確定性，係值得支持嘅。

1253
02:59:32,730 --> 02:59:46,410
從政府嘅角度咧，可以藉此獲得一個契機，喺該時限屆滿之前咧，對於民營市場重新作出整體而全面嘅檢視，進而採取相應嘅政策措施。

1254
02:59:48,690 --> 02:59:51,270
不過，張炳龍局長可能又會話。

1255
02:59:51,990 --> 02:59:58,780
入落條款會對市場帶來錯誤信息，影響政府決心壓抑樓價嘅姿態。

1256
02:59:59,530 --> 03:00:02,840
我哋對呢種講法咧，並不陌生。

1257
03:00:03,170 --> 03:00:07,840
你get到重複聽過好多次㗎啦，字眼雖然未必係完全一樣。

1258
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:29,170
議員同事就本條例草案嘅各項修訂，無論是否真正能夠完善政府提出嘅樓市管理措施，例如咧石禮希石禮謙議員咧係建議容許港人公司咧係可以以先徵後退嘅方法。

1259
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:32,140
政府咧就一概。

1260
03:00:32,530 --> 03:00:34,200
視之為減辣。

1261
03:00:34,670 --> 03:00:39,680
是之為咧，影響市民對政府壓抑樓價嘅信心。

1262
03:00:40,640 --> 03:01:00,650
政府呢種態度，議員同事不滿之餘咧，更加擔心現屆政府班子可能又重演喺回歸以來特區歷屆政府喺房屋政策上面堅步行步、缺乏長遠規劃、施政混亂、反口覆説嘅嚴重錯失。

1263
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:07,920
首任特區行政長官董建華先生上任不久咧，就提出八萬五建屋計劃。

1264
03:01:08,310 --> 03:01:10,320
當時的確贏得掌聲嘅。

1265
03:01:11,370 --> 03:01:14,910
但係，隨住一九九八年亞洲金融風暴。

1266
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:20,340
經濟逆轉，樓價下挫，香港出現大量負資產。

1267
03:01:20,940 --> 03:01:23,710
當我手喺二零零年。

1268
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:29,620
六月到啦嚇，問及會否修訂呢個八萬五嘅時間咧？

1269
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:41,610
嚇就話八萬五呢個咧係冇提出啦嚇，就鬧出一個咧所謂嚇冇講過就唔存在嘅笑話。

1270
03:01:41,960 --> 03:01:44,330
啊！唔再講就不存在。

1271
03:01:46,220 --> 03:01:50,680
令人令香港人好慘痛嘅經驗就係咧。

1272
03:01:51,020 --> 03:02:01,990
而直至到二零零三年中度咧，當時嘅負資產按揭竟然佔所有按揭嘅百分之二十二咁高。

1273
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:06,530
而至到咧，有啲市民由於資金鏈斷裂。

1274
03:02:07,250 --> 03:02:08,860
笑談輕生。

1275
03:02:11,050 --> 03:02:19,140
政府房屋政策一百八十度嘅逆轉喺二零零二年，不單止宣佈咧係停建居屋。

1276
03:02:19,550 --> 03:02:25,860
仲將紅灣半島居屋變私樓，畀人批評為佔賣。

1277
03:02:26,690 --> 03:02:31,360
及後市民對於公共房屋嘅不足咧，係越來越不滿啦。

1278
03:02:32,220 --> 03:02:35,280
曾蔭權特首咧，又堅持唔起居屋。

1279
03:02:35,560 --> 03:02:41,390
以致到咧，以往行之有效嘅公屋、居屋、私樓嘅旋轉門咧。

1280
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:47,520
就變成公屋二手居屋私樓嘅低腳旋轉門。

1281
03:02:48,650 --> 03:02:56,880
直至到曾特首任期嘅尾聲咧，佢先至無可奈何噉樣咧，要選擇重建居屋。

1282
03:02:57,450 --> 03:02:58,170
主席。

1283
03:02:59,350 --> 03:03:03,330
呢段十幾年嘅特區房屋政策嘅歷史。

1284
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:07,720
證明政府嘅政策措施往往係滯後嘅。

1285
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:14,200
到呢啲政策措施生效嘅時候，往往就係市場逆轉嘅時候。

1286
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:16,150
現任特區班子。

1287
03:03:17,090 --> 03:03:22,230
現任特區政府班子，如果唔想喺經濟，

1288
03:03:22,570 --> 03:03:26,730
下錯樓市逆轉嘅時候咧，成為罪人咧。

1289
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:32,470
就一定要做好風險管理同埋期望管理。

1290
03:03:34,570 --> 03:03:35,520
代主席。

1291
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:41,360
本世紀至嚇二千年至到而家咧。

1292
03:03:41,690 --> 03:03:44,630
全球經濟係波濤洶湧。

1293
03:03:46,020 --> 03:03:49,170
二零零八年九月嘅全球。

1294
03:03:49,630 --> 03:03:51,490
金融海嘯。

1295
03:03:52,040 --> 03:03:53,400
直卷。

1296
03:03:54,880 --> 03:03:57,120
全世界嘅所有經濟體係。

1297
03:03:58,050 --> 03:04:01,850
二零零一年咧，歐洲主權。

1298
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:10,200
嘅嚇嘅危機，歐洲主權債券嘅危機，到今年咧，美國退市。

1299
03:04:10,840 --> 03:04:14,300
利息咧，極可能咧又再入升軌啦。

1300
03:04:15,600 --> 03:04:22,090
咁喺噉樣情況之下，風險管理及期望管理咧係更加重要。

1301
03:04:22,370 --> 03:04:29,860
日落條款正正係風險管理同埋期望管理嘅其中嘅一啲有效嘅方法。

1302
03:04:32,330 --> 03:04:42,920
此外咧，對於郭榮亨議員提出嘅修訂，訂明喺二零一二年十月廿七日至到本條例通過同埋刊憲期間。

1303
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:51,090
豁免成為豁免為未成年嘅香港永久性居民購買物業繳交買家印花税咧。

1304
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:52,710
我認為。

1305
03:04:52,990 --> 03:05:01,790
政府喺整個過程之中咧，的確就呢種情況可否豁免嘅説法咧，有相反嘅信息。

1306
03:05:03,490 --> 03:05:07,070
因此，為咗體現公平嘅原則咧。

1307
03:05:08,570 --> 03:05:11,320
郭榮鏗議員嘅建議咧，係值得支持嘅。

1308
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:25,000
主席，現屆特區政府已經開始喺增加土地同埋房屋嘅供應着手，以解決本港嘅房屋供求嚴重失衡嘅問題，係對症下藥之舉嘅。

1309
03:05:25,710 --> 03:05:35,240
短期而言咧，政府企頭依賴本條例草案咧，以打擊炒賣之風，令到炙熱嘅物業市場降屈。

1310
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:42,660
本會同事喺呢幾日嘅為呢個條例草案嘅各項修訂嘅激烈嘅辯論咧。

1311
03:05:43,340 --> 03:05:52,770
市民可能難以全部瞭解裏邊嘅細節，包括重案嘅細節同埋建議修訂嘅細節。

1312
03:05:53,300 --> 03:05:55,680
甚至無我哋本會議員啦。

1313
03:05:56,090 --> 03:05:59,070
一路過程裏邊咧，都產生有啲混亂。

1314
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:04,240
以致咧，有啲人話我哋咧唔知拗乜。

1315
03:06:04,970 --> 03:06:09,810
即使有咧，比較瞭解一啲嘅咧，都會話拗嚟做乜？

1316
03:06:10,730 --> 03:06:16,600
其實我哋正正係想為香港嘅樓市嘅健康發展去盡力。

1317
03:06:17,460 --> 03:06:18,310
當然。

1318
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:38,970
與審議同埋修訂本條例草案相比咧，喺增加土地同埋房屋供應方面，政府當局、立法會同埋社會各界必須付出更大嘅努力，尋求共識，以作出恰當嘅平衡同埋取捨，甚至係滿足市民置業安居期望嘅長久之計。

1319
03:06:38,970 --> 03:06:39,550
該。

1320
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:42,270
代主席，本人簡短陳辭。

1321
03:06:42,570 --> 03:06:43,710
細路仔咪。

1322
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:47,360
多謝，Mr Acting President，The

1323
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:53,430
The CSA introduced by BPA建民律和自由黨。

1324
03:06:54,510 --> 03:06:59,170
Before this council at this moment under debate, I give my support.

1325
03:06:59,470 --> 03:07:01,670
The honourable Andrew Lans.

1326
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:16,520
CSA proposes that the SSD and BSD lapse by midnight of 26 October 2015. That is coincide with the bills for the SSD and the BSD.

1327
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:24,630
而家，Hon. Jones C.S.A. 提出，將S.S.D. 和B.S.D. 擊敗，到12月21日凌晨。

1328
03:07:25,030 --> 03:07:33,600
我會支持，Either of these two amendments， as a sunset clause， can serve as an effective instrument.

1329
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:35,810
要 compel the government.

1330
03:07:36,090 --> 03:07:41,670
要Act on its duty to review the BSD regime before the sunset date.

1331
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:45,470
As you have tried to do it through your oral.

1332
03:07:46,150 --> 03:07:55,440
commitment on the increase of of the measures or the draw of the measures.

1333
03:07:55,720 --> 03:07:56,930
As always.

1334
03:07:57,210 --> 03:08:17,220
Mr. Acting President, the administration perpetual explanation is that it is impossible for the government to protect future market changes. Nobody can, and various external factors, and to choose a date when demand side management measures would no longer be required.

1335
03:08:17,450 --> 03:08:22,410
therefore it argues that any prescribed sunset clause

1336
03:08:22,690 --> 03:08:27,970
會only send wrong messages to the market and fuel demand.

1337
03:08:28,530 --> 03:08:37,100
thus undermining the effectiveness of the measures. The effectiveness of the measures take precedent over everything.

1338
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:39,670
甚至個rights of individual。

1339
03:08:39,950 --> 03:08:47,400
however，this is a specious argument，seems to be right but in actual fact wrong。

1340
03:08:48,370 --> 03:08:56,430
Where the BSD, SSD and DSD are concerned, the government always deceives the public, unfortunately.

1341
03:08:56,710 --> 03:09:16,720
當政府引入SSD在11月2010，第一SSD，當時行政局表示，SSD是個特別措施，因應當時香港的特殊情況，以應付短期內的樓市炒賣。

1342
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:18,730
我支持那條法案。

1343
03:09:19,420 --> 03:09:31,600
在MSCA的 sunset clause， 對《的税捐條例》修訂法案2010被否決，當時大部份的市議會在批准投票中被政府騙。

1344
03:09:32,150 --> 03:09:33,830
by the same token。

1345
03:09:34,250 --> 03:09:53,660
The administration pledge in the stamp duty bill in 2010 to review the SSD once every 24 months or earlier after the enactment of the bill, or as circumstances require. However,

1346
03:09:53,940 --> 03:10:01,310
三 years have passed， and this review have proved to be no more than an exercise or gesture.

1347
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:10,330
The S.S.D. has already becoming a standing stamp duty, instead of a special stamp duty.

1348
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:15,370
然後， incumbent administration told the same.

1349
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:23,840
我我唔會say lie， told the same excuse to the people when it introduced the BSD in October two thousand and one two。

1350
03:10:24,190 --> 03:10:41,680
And the DSD in February 2013, the distressing reality is that there is no end in sight to the SSD, the BSD and the DSD. Given the likelihood of boosting flatsapai as pledged by the chief executive, is bleak.

1351
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:43,920
In the next five years.

1352
03:10:44,380 --> 03:10:57,500
At this rate, it is likely that the so-called extraordinary measures for exceptional times will last forever. Will be, as I said earlier, a standing stamp duty.

1353
03:10:57,970 --> 03:11:09,310
Now that the administration has again undertaken to review and report to LECO one year after the enactment of the 2012 bill, I hope that we can do it today.

1354
03:11:09,590 --> 03:11:23,270
Should we trust the governments, with again and again, Mr. Acting President, when the finite becomes the infinite, the extraordinary will become the ordinary.

1355
03:11:23,580 --> 03:11:35,670
If we allow this to happen again with the B.S.D. regime, it will fly in the face of the objective of imposing tough measures on the property market on a temporary basis.

1356
03:11:36,040 --> 03:11:48,210
This was supported by Kenneth Leung. If we're going to make this a permanent feature, most well, the negative vetting has no place. Must be a positive vetting.

1357
03:11:48,970 --> 03:11:53,230
而家行政部門指責《太陽花》。

1358
03:11:53,510 --> 03:12:09,990
for the possible confusion it would bring to the property market, the administration ought to do some soul searching. Who was the first to disseminate erroneous messages to the market and distort market behaviour by saying that the measures are temporary?

1359
03:12:10,270 --> 03:12:14,440
It was unquestionably, the government itself.

1360
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:32,490
In this context, a sunset clause is necessary to provide a mechanism to put things right, to put things back on the right track, by obliging the government to halt its intervention after a sufficiently long period.

1361
03:12:32,890 --> 03:12:48,050
Furthermore, a sunset clause will provide the government with a timetable to conduct a genuine review of the effectiveness of the BSD, SSD and DSD, and report the results back to the legislature.

1362
03:12:48,610 --> 03:12:53,470
This is what our friend in the opposition camp was asking for.

1363
03:12:53,750 --> 03:13:05,980
Without such a mechanism, there is no guarantee that the administration will undertake any of these commitments. Much as we trust you, and much as they distrust you.

1364
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:22,300
先生，我強烈不諒行政院的主張，即係《太陽曆》的條款，由閣下和譚耀宗議員提出，超出了《印花税條例》的範圍。

1365
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:30,180
In fact, I would like to remind the administration that I also propose a sunset clause.

1366
03:13:30,710 --> 03:13:33,470
be incorporated in the previous.

1367
03:13:34,610 --> 03:13:41,240
在條文 relating to the SSD in the Stamp Duty Amendment Ordinance 2010 Bill。

1368
03:13:42,100 --> 03:13:43,210
和。

1369
03:13:43,630 --> 03:14:03,640
在sections twenty nine C A, twenty nine D A and head one blanket one A A and head one blanket one B in the first schedule of that bill. However, this proposal was not accepted, and therefore no sunset clause is included in the current stamp duty ordinance.

1370
03:14:03,640 --> 03:14:04,020
嗯。

1371
03:14:04,300 --> 03:14:20,470
主席，根據律師會秘書處律師的顧問，對於《撥款委員會》關於印花税修正法案2012，它是清楚地指出，懸頂條款是超出法案的範圍。

1372
03:14:21,330 --> 03:14:25,100
It has no bearing on Part One of the bill.

1373
03:14:25,450 --> 03:14:33,900
where the existing SSD regime is given effect, it is consistent with the long title of the bill.

1374
03:14:34,290 --> 03:14:38,480
And it won't terminate the current SSD regime.

1375
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:41,560
The special stamp duty.

1376
03:14:42,320 --> 03:14:57,410
或者always stamping standing stamp duty (SSD) is charged under the head one bracket one A A and bracket one B of the first chapter of the stamp duty ordinance, cap one one seven.

1377
03:14:57,690 --> 03:15:17,700
The bill proposed to amend by clause 18 the head 1 bracket 1A and 1B to increase the rates of the stamp duty on certain agreement for sale and conveyance on sale of residential properties that are acquired after 27 October.

1378
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:21,710
2012， and disposed within six months.

1379
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:28,490
12個月和36個月，至20%、15%和10%，分別。

1380
03:15:28,770 --> 03:15:48,780
This is effected by adding a part two to have one bracket one A A and one B respectively. The existing S S D regime will become part one and have effect only in the respect of residential properties acquired on or

1381
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:55,080
After 20th November 2010, but before 27th October 2012.

1382
03:15:55,560 --> 03:15:57,290
The sunset clauses.

1383
03:15:57,610 --> 03:16:00,660
have no effect on such amendments.

1384
03:16:01,230 --> 03:16:06,630
They also do not affect the effectiveness of the provision during the first period.

1385
03:16:06,910 --> 03:16:15,540
By the provisions of the bill, the application of the existing provisions imposing SSD is limited to the first period.

1386
03:16:16,130 --> 03:16:21,310
The sunset clause as presented would cause the provision added by the bill.

1387
03:16:21,590 --> 03:16:34,660
To head, rather technical, one blacket one A A and one B and sections 29 C A and section 29 D A cease to have effect after the stipulated expiry dates.

1388
03:16:35,120 --> 03:16:36,750
屌你閪！

1389
03:16:37,110 --> 03:16:44,440
they only affect they only affect residential properties acquired after the respective expiry dates.

1390
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:52,700
sorry，我 have to be a little technical，Mr. President，because I expect the government to answer on this particular aspect。

1391
03:16:52,980 --> 03:16:54,650
在 premises。

1392
03:16:54,930 --> 03:17:08,490
The sunset clauses have no retrospective effect and could not be said to have negated the existing provision imposing SSD or the enhancement provision proposed in the bill.

1393
03:17:09,080 --> 03:17:22,070
When it comes to the long title of the bill, Mr. Secretary, the legal advisers states that the sunset costs are not inconsistent with the long title of the bill.

1394
03:17:23,470 --> 03:17:34,180
The sunset clauses do not affect the operation of the provisions imposing SSD, but only restricting the application of these provisions in time.

1395
03:17:35,870 --> 03:17:42,550
The long title does not state the time during which the SSD regime must remain valid.

1396
03:17:42,980 --> 03:17:53,670
There is no presumption that the provisions of any bill must remain in force indefinitely, and their application could not be restricted in time.

1397
03:17:54,370 --> 03:18:04,370
The sunset clauses do not have the effect of terminating the existing SSD regime if the proposed enhanced regime is not passed.

1398
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:17,750
Moreover, each of the sunset clauses have built-in provisions to allow the expiry date to be amended, so that the SSD provision may be continued after the stated expiry date.

1399
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:22,510
repudiating the administration misconceived argument.

1400
03:18:22,860 --> 03:18:27,170
在第11個小時，關於終止的影響。

1401
03:18:27,450 --> 03:18:47,460
The current SSD regime by the use of sunset clauses. If the proposed amendment to the bill in relation to the SSD are not passed, the legal advisers, our legal advisers, further highlights the fact is that the proposed amendments in the bill have imposed a date, limiting the operation of the current.

1402
03:18:47,460 --> 03:19:05,660
SSD regime up to and include 26 October 2012, and simultaneously propose an enhanced regime to have effect from 27 October 2012. The sunset clause proposed no more than an end for the SSD regime.

1403
03:19:05,940 --> 03:19:18,150
It is within scope for the administration to impose an end date for the existing regime. It is equally within the scope for the members to propose a CSA to.

1404
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:22,100
要 impose a different date.

1405
03:19:22,520 --> 03:19:24,190
Mr. Acting President。

1406
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:37,220
The our our our our president have won kudos for his impartial ruling based on sound reasons and solid legal basis.

1407
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:56,780
In contrast, the administration' rigid and unbending attitude in thwarting the illegal attempt to move the sunset clause until the last minute demonstrate its overbearing attempt to undermine the legitimate power of this legislature, as evidenced by its letter dated.

1408
03:19:57,070 --> 03:20:05,550
11 February to the Legislative Secretary before the deadline for submitting CSA to the bill. This is very rarely being done.

1409
03:20:05,830 --> 03:20:11,390
作為法律顧問的意見，如果行政局的論點被允許保留。

1410
03:20:11,670 --> 03:20:19,390
It would practically mean that the only the administration could introduce amendments to the existing provisions.

1411
03:20:19,920 --> 03:20:34,330
成員們並未被允許提出CSA，就行政修訂的條款而言，這會有影響。改變該條款，除非該變更與行政建議一致。

1412
03:20:34,610 --> 03:20:36,950
This is unacceptable.

1413
03:20:37,610 --> 03:20:38,790
Obviously.

1414
03:20:39,070 --> 03:20:44,590
There is a point in the administration trying to inhibit the electrical from moving the sunset clause.

1415
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:47,560
this was certainly an act of sabotage.

1416
03:20:48,230 --> 03:21:08,240
On the well-established separation of powers, the keystone of one country two system, which is set in stone under the basic law, there is a Chinese saying: a straw shows which way the winds blow. The degeneration of the relationship between the executive administration and the legislative council is evident.

1417
03:21:08,240 --> 03:21:15,860
The acting president, as the old saying goes, fool me once, shame on you; fool me, fool me twice, shame on me.

1418
03:21:16,330 --> 03:21:19,530
You can't pull this over us again. Thank you.

1419
03:21:20,400 --> 03:21:21,750
謝偉俊議員。

1420
03:21:22,660 --> 03:21:42,670
主席，現階段嘅發言咧，就係想表明我嘅立場咧，係支持誒分別由郭榮亨議員提出嘅修訂案，同埋李慧議員代表其他兩位議員提出嘅有關日落條款嘅修訂案。雖然咧喺個次序上咧喺個列序表上咧，就應該係郭榮亨議員嘅修訂案行先。

1421
03:21:42,670 --> 03:21:50,330
不過咧，我亦都希望由於嗰個重要性嘅關係咧，就先講講個日落條款嘅方面嘅一啲嘅觀點。

1422
03:21:51,140 --> 03:22:08,130
主席，剛才多多位同事都講咗咧，點解要有呢啲噉嘅落條款啦？噉啊程度上當然希望可以咧有個所謂check and balance，誒喺即係一個監控或者監察政府嘅施政，特別咧希望可以咧有啲喺唔係咁受歡迎或者唔係噉。

1423
03:22:08,410 --> 03:22:25,560
一般性嘅條文，即係可以令到政府可以加快力度、加快效率去處理有關嘅問題，能夠令到有關嘅原先令到需要立法處理嘅所謂mischieve一啲嘅啊針對嘅政策，可以得佢盡快解決。嗱，呢啲我唔需要多講。

1424
03:22:25,990 --> 03:22:46,000
但係貫徹於我自己不嬲嘅信奉嘅一啲嘅自由市場經濟體係，唔單止淨係話保障誒所謂代主席閣下都經常提嘅保障呢工商界啊、專業界。其實我哋應該唔係淨話保障嗰兩個界別，我哋應該係爭取保障香港呢個最基本最。

1425
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:57,170
undermental最原本嘅一個所謂自由市場，呢一個噉嘅制度先係更加重要。不論你係咩階層，不論你咩背景，香港就係香港咁多年嚟，我哋就係呢個自由市場經濟體係。

1426
03:22:57,740 --> 03:23:16,600
咁所以任何政策係喺呢一方面咧，係cut down我哋或者係想破壞我哋，想誒減少呢方面嘅，我哋要好小心處理。而亦都咧，今次呢一個噉嘅誒意外咧，亦都相對嚟講係非常之重大地損害香港嘅經濟自由呢個噉嘅大原則。

1427
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:26,240
主席，其實咧就剛，我記得有啲議員就講話，喂，我哋其實香港都冇乜現成嘅落條款喺度啊，噉。

1428
03:23:26,520 --> 03:23:45,280
的而且確係，因為歷史上咧，香港都係強勢嘅政府，係不嬲。除咗話以往港英嘅政府係一個殖民地嘅政府之外咧，九七之後嘅政府都係行政主導，甚至有啲有啲議員批評為行政霸道嘅一個政府。所以呢一方面咧，我哋係未吸收到民主社會嗰種噉嘅發展。

1429
03:23:45,710 --> 03:23:56,270
相反咧，睇翻譬如我哋嘅嚇比較成日比比較嘅一個制度啦，英國嘅制度咧，佢哋其實而家呢個日落條款咧，每一年咧最少有兩三個起碼。

1430
03:23:56,610 --> 03:24:10,780
而事實上咧，喺啲工商界別嘅有啲針對性或者係要規管性嘅條文裏邊咧，啊好多時候咧都會有自動自覺地啊，先考慮下應唔應該有日落條款去將有關嘅啊干涉。

1431
03:24:11,060 --> 03:24:23,730
誒工商界運作嘅一啲嘅條文咧，係主動地啊，係定期咧係要檢討，同埋甚至乎咧係，正如我所講咧，係可以自動消失，除非係有關嘅條文再被誒通過。

1432
03:24:24,140 --> 03:24:32,380
咁呢個其實係依唔係一個所謂怪嘅現象，或者不平常嘅現象？相反咧，喺工商界裏邊係一個普遍嘅現象添。

1433
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:54,070
特別主席咧，我哋唔知我留意到咧，有關税項咧，由於税本新呢個噉嘅動作咧，呢個噉嘅性質咧，係將市民嘅財產咧係強制性地徵收而作一啲社會上需要用嘅福利或者其他基建用途。所以咧，每一年咧，我哋都謹慎地咧係處理。

1434
03:24:54,070 --> 03:25:07,530
有關政府提出嘅收嘅議案嘅一個誒財政預算案，而每一次咧都係刻意地咧係去審批佢，再重新咧係將呢個有關嘅税嘅呢個噉嘅條文咧，係每一年好似我哋。

1435
03:25:07,810 --> 03:25:15,050
誒每一年銅鑼大會操噉啊，一個銅鑼就言宣誓咧，要再重新確認嘅。噉啊，税係呢個噉嘅性質喺裏邊。

1436
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:24,380
咁所以完完全全咧，唔係話一個特別嘅誒誒限制，而係一事實上係唔單止係方向，而係應該咁做添。

1437
03:25:27,180 --> 03:25:28,320
主席。

1438
03:25:28,600 --> 03:25:29,530
當然啦。

1439
03:25:29,810 --> 03:25:45,880
我哋而家講嘅條款咧，就唔係講話有啲乜嘢特別事件發生，譬如話有啲咩股票去到咩程度啊，或者地產市場咩發生嘅先至會引發呢條落條款啦。我哋講緊即係個日期上嘅入落條款，咁呢個係當然係亦都係經常可以用嘅一個嚟。

1440
03:25:46,500 --> 03:25:49,800
今次主席，我想再補充講講咧，就係話。

1441
03:25:50,190 --> 03:26:10,200
剛才有同事提過關於基本法嘅問題，咁當然咧，正如我上一節嘅發言咧，基本法咧由於佢本身係一個憲制性嘅文件咧，喺文字上喺深度上咧，雖然係非常重大議題，但係往往咧都係流於比較係表面同粗疏，變咗好多時咧，香港咧就係人都話咧，基本法保

1442
03:26:10,200 --> 03:26:30,210
保護呢樣，保護嗰樣，但係做真正佢打到官司、佢訴訟，甚至係唔同級別嘅訴訟，初初可能原狀法庭會判一個立場，上訴庭可能確認個立場，往往去到終審庭咧，先完完全全推翻曬以前嘅立場。噉啊，政府亦都曾經多次咧係受過呢個方面嘅教訓，因為市民基本。

1443
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:50,220
本法本身咧就係好多好多原則性嘅，係好視乎法官咧，特別係中審庭嘅法官咧，去到佢嘅層面嘅時候咧，佢點樣睇啲價值觀？而事實上咧，誒中國人講個官字兩個口咧係冇錯嘅，因為去到嗰個層面咧，有關嘅法官係完全完全可以用佢自己嘅主觀嘅判斷咧，用佢嘅價值觀咧。

1444
03:26:50,220 --> 03:27:03,860
係揾到適當嘅法理嘅理據咧，適當嘅條文咧，誒令到佢個判決咧喺合法理上咧好似合理噉。咁所以呢個咧就係一個係非常之誒一個有爭議性嘅問題。而事實上咧，香港係更加大爭議。點解咧？

1445
03:27:04,290 --> 03:27:07,740
因為香港咧唔能夠咧，好似我哋誒。

1446
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:28,030
激誒立法會咧，相當大嘅限制咧。我哋唔能夠即時就終審庭嘅判決咧，馬上立法去，無論係誒消滅佢又好，減低又好，更改又好，有關上訴庭嘅所謂最終嘅判決，其他國家有中有終審。

1447
03:27:28,030 --> 03:27:48,040
審權嘅國家啊，對唔住，其他國家咧，地方咧，如果係有一個權咧，立法會係冇呢個基本法裏邊，由於修改同埋釋法嘅政治同法律上嘅限制咧，係唔能夠好似其他地方咁咧，係隨便咧喺立法層面度咧係更改翻法院嘅判決。香港呢個方面嘅所謂終審庭嘅判決。

1448
03:27:48,040 --> 03:27:56,080
係非常之重要，而係唔能夠被更改，咁所以咧就更加傷害更加大。如果係我社會就係唔接受呢啲變調嘅話，

1449
03:27:56,570 --> 03:28:01,860
無奈我哋建基於現實咧，我哋更加要小心睇翻《基本法》裏邊有關嘅條文。

1450
03:28:02,320 --> 03:28:04,330
誒，雖然我剛才講話。

1451
03:28:04,610 --> 03:28:23,230
好多時都係估估下啦，但係起碼咧，就如果牽涉嘅條文越多嘅話咧，我哋更加越要小心咧，瞭解有關嘅誒議案修訂案會否係侵犯或者會否被認為侵犯任何一條基本法？如果係越多越有爭議性嘅話咧，我哋越應該小心。

1452
03:28:23,650 --> 03:28:43,660
嗱，主席，我誒之前嘅發言咧已經講過，最起碼有七條基本法嘅條文咧，會喺呢一次嘅修訂案裏邊咧會牽涉到，我唔需要重複啦。但係我想講講從其中一條咧係可以話非常之關鍵重要嘅咧，誒就喺我哋個總則裏邊嗱，總則咧就當數係而家係。

1453
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:49,430
最重要啦，因為開宗明義最總嚇一個將成個基本法畫龍點睛嘅一個總則啦。

1454
03:28:49,710 --> 03:29:09,720
咁裏邊嘅其他條文牽涉到咩咧？譬如包括第一條嘅講香港嘅主權啊、迴歸啊，誒包括話第第二條咧，關於過高度自治嘅問題啊。誒第四條關於依我哋嘅一個保障香港人嘅權利啊，而第六條咧就保護私有財產啊。第八條咧就話用翻法律啊，用翻普通法啊。

1455
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:29,730
誒呢啲冚論都係最基本、最根基嘅重要條文，而《冚》當中裏邊咧第五條咧，第五條咧，呢個可以話全世界嘅憲法裏邊都揾唔到有同樣有噉嘅憲法嘅喎，就話到明咧，我哋係唔會行社會主義，唔會行社會政策，係會保持我哋嘅資資本制度、資本嘅政。

1456
03:29:29,730 --> 03:29:31,120
政策基本嘅主義。

1457
03:29:31,400 --> 03:29:49,750
嗱，如果呢條咁基本嘅條文咧，係被衝擊、被挑戰嘅話咧，其實係我哋更加、更加要小心睇。但係點解呢條咁基本嘅條文咧，好似我哋大家都好似得個講字係冇真係確切去瞭解到究竟我哋嘅政策每一次嘅條文有冇侵犯呢條條文咧咁？

1458
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:53,890
其中，我相信最重原因咧，就係誒。

1459
03:29:54,300 --> 03:29:57,390
香港咧就訴訟費非常昂貴嘅。

1460
03:29:57,670 --> 03:30:08,920
噉啊！一般咧，市民咧，除非係有啲誒係獲綜援支撐，否則嘅話咧，就未必咧係隨便咁去挑戰政府喺呢啲噉嘅基本法嘅問題上。

1461
03:30:09,530 --> 03:30:16,270
咁而恐怕呢一條嘅第五條條文咧，對於誒一般誒有。

1462
03:30:16,550 --> 03:30:18,370
法律援助支持嘅。

1463
03:30:18,650 --> 03:30:38,660
啊！市民嚟講咧，就未必會用呢一條嘅。相反咧，呢條咧，可能好多時都係會一啲啊工商界啦、專業界咧，或者對於嗰個好似我噉，對於一個自由經濟原則係比較着重嘅人，先至會用呢一條，或者覺得咁緊要。咁但係咧，就正如我剛才所講咧，訴訟費咧個風險咧非常之大嘅，加埋。

1464
03:30:38,660 --> 03:30:47,000
條文本身咧都係可以話係好多空間可以走賺嘅，咁所以咧亦都唔容易攞嚟做一個基礎咧，光為呢條條文咧去出挑戰。

1465
03:30:47,490 --> 03:30:48,350
但係。

1466
03:30:49,130 --> 03:31:01,210
噉樣講法唔等於話我哋咧，將我哋如果任何嘅修訂案、任何嘅政策，要同呢一個基本法第五條對稱嘅時候咧，我哋唔唔應該或者唔需要更加小心去做。

1467
03:31:01,860 --> 03:31:08,750
咁今次咧，恐怕咧就誒呢一個政策本身，雖然好多同事支持話一個緊急嘅政策。

1468
03:31:09,030 --> 03:31:29,040
誒當然我程度都係啱嘅，但係更加重要咧就係話，如果政府口口聲聲話一個臨時嘅政策，話一個關鍵緊急嘅政策嘅時候，而可以咧漠視基本法第五條，漠視其他其他另外五六條嘅基本法條文，包括譬如話誒我。

1469
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:40,430
我哋可以即係啊，推廣呢個地產市啊市誒市場啦。我哋保留香港作為國際金融都會啊，誒嗰啲噉嘅，或者我哋要有低税制啊，呢啲係問題好重要嘅條文。

1470
03:31:40,710 --> 03:31:53,560
噉嘅情況之下咧，我哋更加要小心去睇睇，究竟而家呢個政策有冇乜嘢咧，係過咗位、過分地觸及、過分地侵犯呢啲咁基本嘅條文。

1471
03:31:54,600 --> 03:32:14,610
嗱，主席，我哋誒稍為有留意下以往判案嘅市民咧，都會知道有啲所謂中審庭嘅引用基本法嘅時候，用一啲所謂比合是否合乎比例嘅測試，所謂proportionality test。而當中咧嗰啲近期咧都有個非常之大家受關注嘅案件咧，就孔運明案咧。咁而政府由於咧佢。

1472
03:32:14,610 --> 03:32:19,450
佢所引用嘅一啲嘅誒條文，去支持。

1473
03:32:19,990 --> 03:32:40,000
有關嘅綜援政策由零四年之前嘅一月誒一年就可以獲取，改到去誒七年。呢個政策嘅改變咧，由於政府提出嚟嘅理據咧，足以誒誒支持佢嘅理據咧，只係一啲話，譬如話我哋要保護翻我哋嘅嚇資產唔會過分係。

1474
03:32:40,000 --> 03:33:00,010
係啊！使大咗福利方面，又或者我哋保留翻我哋嗰個中門制度嘅可持續性啊！啊，呢啲噉嘅理由咧，就被中新聯一一駁回啦。包括話我哋誒有一啲需要，由於我哋係誒人口政策啊、誒人口老化呢啲冚棒咧，逐條逐條。

1475
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:20,020
調去稱嗱，呢個逐條稱嘅一個過程咧，將來假如有人真係用我哋基本法咧去測試政府嘅政策同措施嘅時候咧，係至關重要。咁所以咧，更加需要咧睇翻政府而家呢個政策佢嘅支柱、佢嘅理據是否可以面對呢？

1476
03:33:20,020 --> 03:33:22,680
啲測試咧，係承受到呢個壓力。

1477
03:33:23,300 --> 03:33:24,860
嗱，當然咧。

1478
03:33:25,270 --> 03:33:33,560
噉嘅情況之下咧，政府係應該咧盡可能咧係解釋清楚誒點解有呢個原委，點解需要噉樣做。

1479
03:33:33,960 --> 03:33:53,970
亦都咧需要咧有責任咧，將呢個噉嘅傷幹犯或者係侵犯我哋基本法嘅一啲嘅舉措或者政策或者法例咧，盡量減到最輕微、最低或者最短期嗱。呢啲亦都係唔單止話係我剛才好多同事都講咗關於經濟上。

1480
03:33:53,970 --> 03:34:06,400
對於社會影響、對於學員嘅影響，呢啲我都唔需要再多講啦。而係事實上喺法理嘅時候咧，我哋有呢個責任，有呢個需要咧，係將有關嘅幹預咧係減到最低、最短暫。

1481
03:34:06,870 --> 03:34:26,880
噉嘅情況之下咧，而家有關嘅呢啲噉嘅熱絡條款咧，係正正係唔單止係可以幫到呢一方面嘅裁決，甚至講得唔好聽，可以話啲救命草嚟。萬一將來咧，政府有受挑戰嘅時候咧，呢啲噉嘅短期嘅政策、短期嘅措施。

1482
03:34:26,890 --> 03:34:38,100
加埋一個新set clause一個日落條款咧，係可以用作一個充分嘅理據，作為點解政府今次係喺誒明顯地。

1483
03:34:38,730 --> 03:34:58,740
誒，所以engage到啦，即係接觸到我哋嘅基本法嘅有啲嘅限制條文嘅時候，所作出嘅喺誒程度上嘅幹預、程度上嘅破壞，是否可以誒喺法律上合理咧？咁咁呢啲咧就誒。

1484
03:34:59,060 --> 03:35:02,340
正如我所講咧，唔單止係喺。

1485
03:35:03,640 --> 03:35:04,890
政策上。

1486
03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:23,720
喺我哋經濟信息萬變上，喺對於市場上嘅幹預，喺而家我哋亦都退市啊呢啲噉嘅種種嘅原因之下，係有理由，而喺法理上咧，亦都有非常之非常之重要嘅嘅根據。咁所以咧，主席，我誒喺呢一方面咧，無論係誒張雨仁嘅。

1487
03:35:24,170 --> 03:35:25,310
或者另外。

1488
03:35:25,710 --> 03:35:45,720
無論係邊個條款，總之可以能夠令到呢個時限制嘅時間、幹預嘅程度係可以受到一定嘅約束過咧，我覺得喺道理上都應該支持。咁當然咧，政府係隨時有權咧，好似我哋嘅税收樣咧，每一年咧就可以去更新嘅。咁而好似剛才啊陶錦生員都講過咧，當年我哋嘅税務管制。

1489
03:35:45,720 --> 03:36:05,730
嚟都一樣，所以咧唔係當然一般嚟講咧，我哋嘅法律係希望有啲長久性，但係嗰種法律係係針對一啲嘅，譬如刑事啊，其他我哋社會上一啲向前行嘅進步嘅法律係啱嘅，但係啲短期嘅措施，特別工商界嘅措施，包括好似我哋所講嘅限奶令咧，呢啲破壞香港自由經。

1490
03:36:05,730 --> 03:36:24,330
甚至係侵犯大家自由嘅條嘅條文咧，係應該咧喺原則上嘅個方向先係有個諗住點樣限制。而實際上咧，英國而家咧個做做法咧就係每一次佢哋有咩政策嘅時候，第一件事就問：夠呢個幹預係咪應該有個日落條款添？咁當然我哋呢個係英國嘅參可值得參考嘅做法。

1491
03:36:25,180 --> 03:36:26,500
有咩意見？

1492
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:39,750
主席，嗱處理呢一個嘅條例咧，即係基本上係有兩個嘅重大嘅範疇咧，即係同埋個價值咧，要作出呢個嘅選擇。

1493
03:36:40,170 --> 03:37:00,180
噉，正如我喺先前兩次嘅發言提出咧，即係局長誒同兩個嘅組織之間嘅協議咧，係違背咗同埋損害咗呢一個嘅審議條例嘅尊嚴，亦都傷害咗呢個立法會嘅尊嚴。咁如果喺呢個角度嚟講咧，我哋理應用各種方法咧。

1494
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:20,190
去否決或者係否定或者係阻礙呢個條例嘅通過啊！希望呢個條例可以重返呢個嘅委員會咧，再進行呢個討論，還翻呢個尊嚴畀呢個議會。但係從階級嘅立場，特別即係大家睇到我同石禮謙嘅針鋒相對咧，係明顯顯露呢個條例。

1495
03:37:20,190 --> 03:37:40,200
本身咧對對對呢個地產商嘅利益嘅傷害咧，至令到石禮謙即係瘋狂噉樣樣咧，即係作呢一個嘅回應啊，同埋咧不斷發言啊，即係用盡各種嘅方法誒手段啊，包括用一啲嘅人身攻擊抹。

1496
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:44,720
黑嘅手段咧，即係以達到佢嘅政治目的。

1497
03:37:45,000 --> 03:38:05,010
頭先佢唔係好明，我封佢做Captain Hong Kong，即係嗰個嘅意思。如果大家睇過呢個電影咧，《Captain America》嘅電影咧，都見到呢一個啊，即係好英勇嘅人士咧，為咗個目的咧，可以奮不顧身。其實今日石禮謙就為咗香港地產商嘅利益咧。

1498
03:38:05,060 --> 03:38:12,400
其實我唔應該叫做Captain Hong Kong嘅，我應該叫做Captain Hong Kong，即係Hong Kong Landlord Captain。

1499
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:17,140
係嘛？即係香港地主，特別係大地主。

1500
03:38:17,430 --> 03:38:37,440
根本係地產商啊，即係嘅打手啊，即係為咗捍衞地產商嘅利益咧，可以係不擇手段啊嚟呢個嘅誒達至呢個效果。嗱，你睇翻呢一個嘅條例，我諗如果從較為深層次嘅政治嘅角度要。

1501
03:38:37,440 --> 03:38:43,190
要分析嘅話咧，即係究竟點解呢個六百九啊？點解呢個嘅梁振英？

1502
03:38:43,470 --> 03:38:53,920
喺完全冇諮詢情況之下，喺好多大地產商都唔認同情況之下咧，推出一個夠膽推出一個。

1503
03:38:55,350 --> 03:39:02,270
損害香港既得利益集團嘅一個嘅條例同埋呢個嘅政策啊！

1504
03:39:03,740 --> 03:39:14,240
即係如果你仔細分析呢個條文同埋呢一個政策帶嚟啲咩效果咧？嗱，第一就係樓市會下跌啦，樓市會下跌。

1505
03:39:14,520 --> 03:39:34,530
啊，當然佢美其名就係為咗香港嘅普羅大眾，你唔好畀呢個嘅樓市嘅影響咧，而導致到個經濟啊同埋呢一個嘅啊，即係市民嘅福利受影響。喂，但係另外呢個自由行啊，即係每年跟下五千四百萬嘅遊客嚟。

1506
03:39:34,530 --> 03:39:49,890
香港呢一個嘅自由行所引起嘅效果，同樣令到香港嘅樓市瘋狂上升嘅，特別係呢個嘅商業商業嘅樓宇，但係佢就無動於衷，繼續係鼓吹呢一個嘅。

1507
03:39:50,360 --> 03:40:10,370
即係自由行，包括一簽多行，係繼續推呢一個香港商業樓市去到瘋狂嘅程度喎。最近不過有啲好出名嘅食肆都因為呢一個嘅啊租金嘅瘋狂上升而要被逼結業，但係你睇到呢個矛盾喺度嘅喎，點解同？

1508
03:40:10,370 --> 03:40:22,730
一個政府同一個政府，一方面為咗呢個嘅樓市嘅問題，啊，用呢個立法嘅手段去做；另一方面，同一個政策令到個樓市瘋狂飆升。

1509
03:40:23,010 --> 03:40:27,600
啊！呢個自由行當然石禮軒咪極力支持啦，係嘛？

1510
03:40:27,920 --> 03:40:33,650
點解會有咁精神分裂嘅情況咧？係嘛？

1511
03:40:33,930 --> 03:40:42,300
當然家下即係好多嘅政治人物都有啲精神分裂㗎啦，即係口不對心係嘛？好多時投票咧就揞住個良心投票嘅。

1512
03:40:43,240 --> 03:40:59,620
噉你好明顯睇到嗱，其實如果你從政治嘅角度去睇咧，即係你分析呢個六百九做任何嘢，最後都係從政治嘅啫。你唔可以從呢一個嘅常理，唔可以從呢個良知，唔可以從呢一個嘅啊，即係一般嘅公共政策嘅。

1513
03:40:59,930 --> 03:41:06,160
分析咧，去試圖瞭解有關去推動某啲政策背後嘅目的。

1514
03:41:06,440 --> 03:41:24,330
咁點解兩個嘅政策，一個辣椒雙辣椒，一個呢一個自由行？點解兩個政策都係六八九推動，而背後大家都睇到即係之間嗰個結果同埋嘅影響係有呢個矛盾性，而呢個嘅六八九係繼續推動咧咁？

1515
03:41:25,630 --> 03:41:39,010
咁一個就係華資透過呢一個嘅雙辣椒咧，可能係要動搖香港華資嘅政治地位同埋社會嘅同埋經濟嘅地位同埋影響力。

1516
03:41:39,290 --> 03:41:40,140
係嘛？

1517
03:41:40,870 --> 03:42:00,880
另一個就係透過自由行，進一步加強呢個嘅內地，特別係大陸對香港嘅經濟、民生、文化、社會等等嘅影響力。阿陳議員，我認為你而家係離題啦。嗱，主席呢個同呢個即係啊落日條款有啲關。

1518
03:42:00,880 --> 03:42:12,370
問題嘅，因為落個條款係削減個影響力㗎嘛，係嘛？即係削，因為定咗個時間之後咧，就會影響咗呢個條例嘅落實。進而呢個條例嘅落實咧，係影響咗某啲嘅政治嘅影響力。

1519
03:42:12,650 --> 03:42:32,660
即係可以咁解釋嘅，主席。千祈唔好發表太多，應該喺二讀辯論嘅時候發表嘅。啊，呢個係嘅修訂條文，家下討論緊呢個日落條款。噉我家就討論翻日落條款裏面，基於個時間嘅限嗰個嘅條例，因為某啲時空嘅規限咧，而導致到個條例嘅政治嘅影響。

1520
03:42:32,660 --> 03:42:52,670
響，因而受到呢個嘅削減噉。不過多謝主啊，主席嘅指正啦。啊，咁基本上即係如果你從嗰個嘅實際嘅效果去睇翻咧，所帶所帶嚟嘅即係效果咧，即係我相信大家係唔可以忽視。當然呢一啲嘅有關嘅效果。

1521
03:42:52,670 --> 03:43:12,680
啊！包括如果係日落條文得以呢個落實，而有關嘅誒政策同埋嘅法例所帶嚟嘅影響，因而得到呢個嘅削減咧。但係整體嘅政治嘅效果咧，都係呢個嘅不容忽視嘅。咁所以當然即係我冇呢一個嘅水晶球啦。

1522
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:29,220
啊！最後都係要睇相相應嘅發展咧，特別係三年之後啊，即係究竟香港整體嘅政治、經濟、民生嗰個嘅扭曲同埋個改變程度，即係去到邊一部分？但係對人民力量嚟講咧。

1523
03:43:29,530 --> 03:43:49,540
喺有關嘅投票咧，我哋係喺一個兩難嘅位置嘅啊，一個就即係針對市民嘅利益，誒，即係減低呢個地產商嘅影響力；第二就係要捍衞呢個議事堂嘅尊嚴。咁所以，我哋喺不同嘅時候咧。

1524
03:43:49,540 --> 03:44:09,550
可能會喺投票取向上咧，係會有呢一個嘅選取噉。但係，我想就翻日落條款特別呢個嘅郭榮亨議員所提出嗰個嘅修訂咧，即係我都係帶出一個好重要嘅問題，就係有關法例嗰個追索期，即係嗰個嘅公正性嘅問題。

1525
03:44:10,080 --> 03:44:30,090
啊！任何嘅條例要有呢一個嘅即係追溯先前有效嘅話咧，除非係一個好特別或者係好誒，即係有理據嘅話，咁如果唔係咧，誒，因為即係因為你任何追溯追溯性都好咧，一定對被追。

1526
03:44:30,090 --> 03:44:50,100
數嘅社羣或者係有關人士咧，係帶嚟呢個嘅利益嘅影響，咪主要係損失嘅。咁當有關人士喺事前唔知，喺事後至被追討咧，呢個違反基本嘅自然公正嘅原則嘅。咁所以喺。

1527
03:44:50,100 --> 03:45:10,110
呢個嘅入落條款，特別涉及到一啲追索性嘅條文嗰度咧，噉我覺得我哋係會誒支持啊，即係有關嘅誒建議，因為即係對一啲嘅人士，如果喺佢唔知情情況之下，事後自備誒即係追索有關嘅利益嘅話咧，我哋覺得呢個係違。

1528
03:45:10,110 --> 03:45:12,120
反自然公義嘅，多謝主席。

1529
03:45:13,050 --> 03:45:14,250
謝偉俊議員。

1530
03:45:14,940 --> 03:45:21,480
多謝主席。主席呢個環節，我希望可以咧就誒解釋一下，我就郭榮亨議員所提出嘅修訂案嘅立場。

1531
03:45:22,610 --> 03:45:23,860
主席嘅。

1532
03:45:24,170 --> 03:45:33,120
睇翻呢個有關嘅條文咧，就係就呢個賣家印花税咧，最先提出嘅時候係二零一二年嘅十月二十六號。

1533
03:45:33,400 --> 03:45:36,170
就話喺二月十七號，即係之後會生效啦。

1534
03:45:37,010 --> 03:45:51,300
然之後咧，我哋睇到咧就係一路要去到，由於審議嘅階段嘅需要啦，去到咧就二零一三年嘅十二月十八號咧，先至有本會嘅同事啊，葉劉淑儀議員咧提出佢嘅。

1535
03:45:51,580 --> 03:45:59,240
誒建議嚇咁而而家呢個建議咧個日期係二零一三年十月二十十月對唔對？十二月十八號。

1536
03:45:59,520 --> 03:46:19,530
而秘書處咧就亦都就有關嘅建議咧，就喺二零一四年嘅一月七號咧，就有個要求畀政府咧要進一步誒回應。而政府咧，我嘅文件上面咧睇唔到個日期，即係寫一月二零一四，但係根據個存真嘅日子咧，應該就係二零一四年嘅一月六號咧，由秘書。

1537
03:46:19,530 --> 03:46:21,320
分發畀所有議員。

1538
03:46:21,630 --> 03:46:25,120
嗱，主要點解我講呢啲噉嘅日期咧？個重要性喺邊度咧？

1539
03:46:25,900 --> 03:46:37,220
主席，誒，我哋由於種種原因咧，今次呢一個有追索性嘅立法咧，先執行後審議嘅立法咧，係拖咗唔少嘅時間。

1540
03:46:37,740 --> 03:46:46,930
如果你話係一個短嘅時間，大家都明白到咧立法一定有風險咧，係可能會喺過程中咧有更改，但係由於呢個咁長嘅時間咧，

1541
03:46:47,210 --> 03:46:54,860
加上一個係誒追索性嘅理由咧，呢兩個加埋咧，嗰個影響咧，我哋必須要係評估嘅。

1542
03:46:55,340 --> 03:47:08,260
噉我哋喺衡量任何誒公道又好合尺度又好嘅審視嘅時候咧，必須要審視埋呢一個比較長嘅一個誒期間。

1543
03:47:10,350 --> 03:47:30,360
主席誒，多位同事包括郭永欣議員咧，都就有關嘅一個所謂法律上嘅基本原則，即係唔應該追索性講咗好多地方，我都唔需要再補充。啊，唯一我哋當然要講呢個問題嘅時候，要小心分野究竟係講緊啲乜嘢，因為有啲同事可能我哋講嗰陣時就誒將好多概念撈埋一疊嚟講嘅。

1544
03:47:30,360 --> 03:47:47,720
包括譬如話係咪一啲嘅誒誒所謂追索性咧，以前做咗嘅行為咧，於是就而家開始將以往嗰啲都算係違法咧噉。咁呢啲咁嚴重嘅，當然係要更加緊要小心處理個追索性啦，亦都應該一般情況之下係唔應該咁做啦。

1545
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:56,730
係，只要有啲可能係話以往發生嘅事，不過將來咧有啲咩後果，有啲咩可以跟進咧？呢啲可能咧都係某程度上追索，但係性質上又唔同。

1546
03:47:57,010 --> 03:48:17,020
嗱，至於而家講緊話係有啲法例誒，特別有需要。由於譬如一般嚟講喺税收方面咧，由於個市場敏感、時間上關鍵咧，於是咧我哋需要咧係先立法，或者先表明政府嘅態度或者立場或者政策，然之後咧先至係誒完成嗰個立法程序。

1547
03:48:17,020 --> 03:48:37,030
呢啲又另一種嘅追索性，所以我哋一定要搞清楚噉係邊一樣嘢，而係唔同嘅場合、唔同嘅情況、唔同嘅性質，同埋唔同嘅一個長短情況下咧，係應該有唔同嘅一尺度嘅量度。係乜嘢情況之下，我哋可以輕輕寬鬆翻少少？乜嘢情況之下，我哋完全寸步不讓咧？

1548
03:48:38,040 --> 03:48:44,530
主席誒，今次另一個，我都係比較需要誒留意嘅誒地方咧，就係。

1549
03:48:45,090 --> 03:48:47,600
誒有關嘅修訂。

1550
03:48:48,120 --> 03:48:49,550
並非由。

1551
03:48:50,030 --> 03:48:51,100
誒。

1552
03:48:52,190 --> 03:48:56,880
所謂議會經過審議嘅過程提出。

1553
03:48:57,220 --> 03:49:01,920
誒由議當然而家技術上都係議員提出啦，但係事實上咧。

1554
03:49:02,230 --> 03:49:03,220
嗯。

1555
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:23,510
並非因為政府佢嘅政策本來冇改動，但係由於面向或者面對不可預見嘅情況，政府嘅有關建議係被否決，又或者咧被任何議員提出嘅修訂案咧獲通過之後咧，政府係需要咧係被逼接受呢個政。

1556
03:49:23,510 --> 03:49:39,920
政策上嘅更改，嗱，今次咧呢個咧係政府本身咧，當然背後有冇事先同阿梁葉周阿葉劉劉翠怡有有個傾偈，有溝通，有去負責誒帶帶領呢個噉嘅出路，甚至攞彩呢個，大家都可以自己有自己嘅判斷。

1557
03:49:40,200 --> 03:50:00,210
但係起碼咧，喺原則上咧，今次並非好似政府咁講咧，就話一般嘅原則下，我哋立法，我哋唔包保、唔包生仔嘅。你哋大家市民咧要小心，依個係我哋政策，但係喺立法過程裏邊咧，我哋並不包或者並不保證有關嘅政策措施、有關嘅條文。

1558
03:50:00,210 --> 03:50:20,220
咧係獲原汁原味咁通過嗱，呢個講法咧，如果係平常情況下咧，係被逼嘅咧，可以個力度可能大啲，亦都好似有啲官員誒曾經嘗試同我溝通嘅時候，都喺呢方面嘅理解咧，我都明白呢一點嘅啊。一般嚟講，市民係應該會知道啊，有呢個風險，但係今次咧就。

1559
03:50:20,220 --> 03:50:40,230
係一個可以話係政府個態度咧，喺政策上咧係一百八十度轉變咗喺呢一方面，而係如果稍為政府係事先周詳啲諗過嘅話咧，可能咧就唔需要面向呢個咁尷尬嘅問題。但係政府正如佢推出嘅時候咧，係拍曬心口講咧，原先嗰個政策嗰個。

1560
03:50:40,230 --> 03:50:49,380
立場咧係符合法律、符合基本法，甚至攞個誒法律嘅意見係應該值得推薦嘅，誒係可以捍衞嘅。

1561
03:50:49,660 --> 03:51:09,670
咁但係咧，就冇幾耐之後咧，就經過審議嘅時候咧，就發覺原來咧都好多漏洞。咁當然呢個咧亦都係誒，正如剛才所講咧，誒，我哋都有時會見到情況發生，但係由於配合埋剛才所提嘅咧喺程序上嘅拖延咧，係令到可能有人咧，雖然可能數目唔係多，但係。

1562
03:51:09,670 --> 03:51:19,510
依賴咗政府嘅政策嘅公開宣告，而係喺行為上、喺交易上受影響咧。咁呢個我哋不得不咧，係要小心處理。

1563
03:51:19,790 --> 03:51:39,800
主席，噉嘅情況之下咧，我覺得配合翻剛才所講嘅一個所謂係一個negative rating，一個先審先執行後審議嘅情況，一個係拖咗咁耐嘅情況，而中間嘅時間係非常之長，導致到咧能夠影響市民嘅權利嘅機會都多咗好多。加埋咧，呢個係唔係政府本身？

1564
03:51:39,800 --> 03:51:59,810
誒嘅誒，對唔住，依個唔係本政府咧，係遇到困難，係冇法子獲得足夠嘅支持，甚至乎係被議員咧係主動提出一個修訂案咧，係通過咗，迫使政府咧係要改變立場。咁雖然呢個表面而家都係包裝成咁啦，但係事實上並非係咁啦。今日情況之下咧，我覺得我哋。

1565
03:51:59,810 --> 03:52:02,560
係需要咧，係考慮翻有關嘅情況。

1566
03:52:02,990 --> 03:52:13,030
咁另外一個論點咧，我亦都見到有一啲嘅論述咧，係有啲誒律師行代表個別嘅當事人提出嘅論點咧。

1567
03:52:13,310 --> 03:52:14,760
特別就係話。

1568
03:52:15,050 --> 03:52:29,350
即使如果真係唔能夠完完全全係確保誒有關嘅人事唔會喺誒好似郭文欣議員所講咧，去到立法生效起。

1569
03:52:29,910 --> 03:52:46,160
先至係被剝奪呢個噉嘅豁豁免嘅權利咧，係咪都應該考慮下咧？喺政府提出佢修訂嘅時候、修改佢政策原意嘅時候，意思即係話咧，去到二零一四年嘅一月六號或者七號嘅時候。

1570
03:52:46,440 --> 03:52:49,810
再公告天下啦！話政府而家經考慮。

1571
03:52:50,200 --> 03:53:01,310
周長經個議員嘅誒喺立法過程中嘅理解多咗之後咧，政府係更改佢嘅立場咧，噉。

1572
03:53:01,590 --> 03:53:21,600
都起碼用呢個日期咧，作為一個cut off date一個關鍵嘅轉折點咧。咁呢個係誒當而家唔係我哋枱面上見到有嘅修訂案嘅內容，但係呢個如果政府能夠可以喺佢哋誒或者回應嘅時候，可以講講點樣處理呢個噉嘅情況，係咪可以有任何嘅讓步咧？雖然喺程序上可能需要啲特別嘅修訂。

1573
03:53:21,600 --> 03:53:32,210
但係，如果係能夠噉樣做法嘅咧，我覺得都係一個係誒有責任嘅政府應該考慮嘅問題。嗱，主席，我哋喺法律上咧。

1574
03:53:33,500 --> 03:53:34,680
誒。

1575
03:53:35,160 --> 03:53:51,450
剛才所提過嘅政策原則，或者一般嘅法立法嘅原則咧，就係話法律未通過一日咧，都係仍然係只係藍紙草案嘅，係一個草議案。於是咧，市民你哋應該要知道咧，呢個係有風險嘅一個草議案。嗱，呢個原則咧，一般嚟講係啱嘅。

1576
03:53:51,910 --> 03:54:03,250
誒或甚或咧，就比較難去挑戰一個誒喺法律上挑戰政府呢個做法咧，究竟係冇所謂叫做即係違法啊？能唔能夠可以去司法覆核佢咧？

1577
03:54:03,530 --> 03:54:23,540
但係，作為一個誒有信守信實嘅政府咧，甚至希望可以喺市民心目中咧係誒增加佢嘅正面嘅形象嘅政府咧，係應該更加要小心咧。就係話任何呢啲噉嘅做法，配合翻剛才我所講嘅多點嘅特殊原因之下咧，係應該特別去小心處理任何一個。

1578
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:33,420
就算任何一個受害嘅對象咧，都應該係要適當地考慮同處理，因為基本上呢個做法咧係政府自己所帶出嚟。多謝主席。

1579
03:54:33,730 --> 03:54:34,730
我叫你。

1580
03:54:38,080 --> 03:54:58,090
嗱，李慧瓊議員嘅第四至第七項修正案，即係第七十條啊，噉就誒兩個部分嘅。第一個部分咧就係關於徵收額外印花税定立呢個立定入落條款，另一個部分咧就係為咗徵收呢個買家印花税誒定立呢個入落條款啊。嗱，我首先表明個立場，我唔。

1581
03:54:58,090 --> 03:55:18,100
支持為呢個額外印花税定立入落條款，但係支持為買家印花税定立呢個入落條款。啊，呢個係從一個常識嘅角度出發嘅。啊，首先即係喺二零一零年十一月二十日開始，任何一個人或者公司誒嘅名義喺二零一零年十一月二十日或

1582
03:55:18,100 --> 03:55:38,110
以後取得嘅住宅物業，並且喺取得呢個物業之後二十四個月去轉售，就要畀呢個五個percent至到十五個percent嘅交易金額計算嘅額外印花税啊！咁呢個主要就係針對本地市場炒賣過熱嘅現象，希望藉著噉樣可以徵收呢個即係所謂額。

1583
03:55:38,110 --> 03:55:58,120
外印花税嚟增加呢個買家嘅成本，但係從一個房屋政策嚟講，其實你最終嘅目標，你都係希望即係話香港人啊，即係香港嘅永久居民啊，能夠成功置業喺一個噉嘅市場裏邊，係嘛？即係你壓抑嗰個樓市炒賣。

1584
03:55:58,120 --> 03:56:18,130
過熱呢個呢個，所以呢一個係即係個嗰個目標係好清晰嘅，係咪？所以政府話反對即係呢個誒額外印花税定立條款嘅理據咧，即係我又唔係好接受嘅，因為你講你個講法就係唔可以揣測日後嗰個市場嘅變化，或者冇單一嘅指標能夠完全反映物業。

1585
03:56:18,130 --> 03:56:38,140
市場嘅基本狀況等等呢啲噉嘅講法係咪？嗱，其實政府似乎忽略咗咧呢個額外印花税原來嘅意義啊嘛，係咪？額外印花税除咗係針對針對本地市場炒賣過熱嘅現象之外，亦都希望喺個需求裏邊入手，係咪？透過減少需求而從而減低呢？

1586
03:56:38,140 --> 03:56:42,290
個樓市嘅價格係咪？但係今時今日。

1587
03:56:42,570 --> 03:57:02,580
嗰個樓價樓市嘅情況係嘛？即係樓即係個樓價高企嘅原因就係因為供需失衡啊嘛，啱唔啱啊？係嘛？即係無論你用幾多辣椒，其實如果嚴格嚟講啊，即係從一個結構性去睇問題嘅，佢都冇辦法令到個樓市價格大幅下降嘅，係咪？所以有啲人。

1588
03:57:02,580 --> 03:57:22,590
人擔心，哇冧市啊！點冧啊？嚇嗰個完全係一個市場供求問題，好清楚㗎啦，大佬係咪？你就算而家要徵收十五個percent嘅買家税，都可能有嗰啲人嚟買樓嘅一樣啱唔啱啊？係咪即係佢可能唔炒，但係佢買嚟擺喺度都好係咪都有㗎嘛？一樣係咪？

1589
03:57:22,590 --> 03:57:42,600
啊！所以你無論用幾多辣椒，你其實係冇辦法令到個樓市價格大幅下降。好似阿田北俊話齋，你都唔想佢冧啦，係咪？你都係嘛個市冧，你都死啦，一樣嘅啫嘛，係咪？其實而家呢啲辣椒，你可唔可以冧市咧？係咪令到冇可能嘅？基本上係咩？即係因為你供應不足啊嘛，你。

1590
03:57:42,600 --> 03:57:44,580
供應嚴重不足。

1591
03:57:44,860 --> 03:57:52,000
所以你睇翻點解嗰個長策會會提出啊？嗰個所謂十年即係興建房屋四十七萬。

1592
03:57:52,940 --> 03:58:11,040
個單位係嘛噉啊，公私營嘅比例係六比四，即係話咧，你呢個所謂不可揣測日後市場變化論斷係站不住腳㗎嘛？都講明畀你聽，以後十年有四十七萬個單位啦，係咪係嘛？噉你你嗰個講法點合理啫？

1593
03:58:11,340 --> 03:58:13,560
係唔通嘅，基本上係，係咪？

1594
03:58:13,840 --> 03:58:26,170
誒，除非你話六八九啊講大話嘅，係咪？誒政府咧一定係冇辦法喺未來十年起到四十七萬個單位嘅，包括你老人家啊，即係。

1595
03:58:26,530 --> 03:58:27,620
應承。

1596
03:58:27,900 --> 03:58:43,890
即係嚇，要按照呢個長策會個建議嚇，起多啲呢個公營房屋啊，每年兩萬個啊，兩萬對六千啊，呢個呢個資助房屋公屋就兩萬，居屋就六千噉。到時呢一可能又。

1597
03:58:44,300 --> 03:58:53,520
彈票噉啊，噉啊啱啦！你呢個揣測就啱啦，因為呢一個所謂不可能揣測日後的市場變化咧，喺你個手裏邊啊嘛。

1598
03:58:53,800 --> 03:58:54,920
啱唔啱？

1599
03:58:55,530 --> 03:59:15,540
而家我哋成日講地產霸權，喂，最大地產霸權咪政府咯，簡單啫嘛。你加我啲地產商，好似啊誒田北俊嗰啲噉嘅規模嘅大佬，佢梗係貴買貴賣㗎啦。高地價，建築成本又高，佢最好而家輸入大量勞外地勞工，起得快啲，成本。

1600
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:26,680
低啲，噉佢又會話畀你聽。阿天少就嗱，咁啲屋都可以平啲啦，大佬我成本低啊嘛，係咪？而家我計個條數萬幾萬一隻成本，我梗係賣你兩皮一隻啦，係咪？

1601
03:59:27,130 --> 03:59:33,550
邊個造成啫？呢個係一個結構性問題嚟嘅。今日講呢個唔係咯，今日講呢個係咩啊？

1602
03:59:33,830 --> 03:59:34,710
喂。

1603
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:52,000
你又令到香港永久性居民可以置業安居，係嘛？兩公婆揾幾皮嘅嗰啲噉嘅中產階級買到樓咧，起碼要好過兩個喺度牛衣對泣，兩公婆專業人士加埋揾五六萬一個月係冇辦法買樓嘅，而家係係嘛？

1604
03:59:52,490 --> 04:00:06,110
個關鍵就喺呢度，所以咧，如果譬如而家最近咧，主席誒話香港人排外，週一我唔知咪發咗咩癲，話係可唔可以呢個物係種族歧視喎？食錯藥，噉你咪同一個種族嘅咩？

1605
04:00:06,390 --> 04:00:26,400
大陸人同香港人唔係同一個種族嘅，原來。即係如果按照週週一我個邏輯就係，大陸係唔同種嘅，同我哋黐線嘅呢條友short咗，噉啊。所以呢條友咧做食衞局又係short，走去做平機會主席一樣係short嘅。原來所有而家呢啲噉啊，即係法定機構，包括你時間，總之喺六八九嘅一。

1606
04:00:26,400 --> 04:00:30,290
影底下全部都short咗嘅。啊，黃議員，你發言離題啦。

1607
04:00:30,630 --> 04:00:32,380
冇離題嘅，主席。

1608
04:00:32,660 --> 04:00:39,120
呢一個條款，成一個成個修訂條例草案主席，我話畀你聽，就係一個排外條款，啱唔啱啊？

1609
04:00:40,450 --> 04:00:44,170
你唔敢講啫嘛？呢個就係一個排外條款嚟㗎嘛！

1610
04:00:44,650 --> 04:00:51,270
令到香港以外、香港永久居民以外嘅人嚟買樓，要畀多啲錢。

1611
04:00:51,980 --> 04:00:59,220
要畀十五個percent印花税，咁仲咪排外條款啊？呢個係不過你唔敢講啫嘛，你政府已經帶頭都排外，不我歡迎。

1612
04:00:59,580 --> 04:01:02,940
O.K.，因為你保障咗本地。

1613
04:01:03,220 --> 04:01:06,530
香港人，香港永久居民買樓。

1614
04:01:06,810 --> 04:01:17,700
嗰個權利啱唔啱？政府做呢樣嘢，我係贊成。不過啲修訂案裏邊咧，搞到亂曬龍啊！先定立後審議嗰啲，三讀先鬧你。O K，係嘛？

1615
04:01:18,690 --> 04:01:23,450
琴日咧就好好彩嘅，講就講啊，第十六條納入嘅時候咧。

1616
04:01:23,730 --> 04:01:43,740
我啊唔知去咗邊喎，即係所以咧，我而家咧就陶謹申唔喺度，因為佢之前走埋嚟提我㗎啦，我又蒙查查噉佢嗱呢度咧就可能都畀人否決㗎啦，不過咧十六條嗰度咧又有自由黨啊，有石禮謙啊，加加埋埋咧可能夠票懟冧佢嘅，你明唔明啊？噉我一聽見咦都好喎，我嗱主體成個法。

1617
04:01:43,740 --> 04:01:54,160
係咧，修訂我係贊成嘅。辣椒係嘛排外條款，O K，政府帶頭排外，政府本土主義，我梗係贊成啦，啱唔啱？係咪？

1618
04:01:54,640 --> 04:02:14,650
但係嗰條十六條可以攔下你啊嘛，因為你做衰嘢啊嘛，有口頭承諾啦，係咪？又一陣間咧呢個先定立後審議又畀你過啊，即係又過咗啦，係咪？喂，噉我又慶啊嘛，你明唔明嗱？我真係立場一定要講清楚，我慶啊，所以其實我都唔知咩事嘅。咁阿土嚟同我講，喂，既

1619
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:22,710
得啊！咁好啦，我就話畀個助理聽。點知我同佢溝通有問題，我就出去咗食嘢，即係就啱啱遇著，剛剛就嗰個時間。

1620
04:02:22,990 --> 04:02:35,290
咁撚咩？我睇咦，咁仲有就當仲有個方剛咧，係咪？跟住仲有兩個激進派，係咪啊？仲有仲有湯家華，仲有林大輝。啊，王議員，你發言離題啦！

1621
04:02:35,570 --> 04:02:55,580
唔係，我借呢個機會咧要道歉啊嘛，大佬我嗱，我哋即係打就要，錯就要認，打就企定，你明咩？咁好在有幾個陪葬。如果唔係得我一個咧，就真係大件事。不過其實都無關宏旨。請你就十七條及各項修正案發言嗱，我我我咧，因為咧今日咧呢個主角咧石禮謙啊，所以佢。

1622
04:02:55,580 --> 04:03:15,590
發言最多噉，我都盡量嚇，即係少發言咁咧。就就就就我啦，大佬係唔係？我而家三讀又講十五分鐘㗎，係咪天馬行空㗎啦？係咪有建設性嘅啲講法，啟發性嘅呢個咪排外條款啊？主席係咪係百分之一百嘅排外條款嚟㗎嘛？排外唔一定係唔啱㗎嘛。

1623
04:03:15,590 --> 04:03:30,960
係嘛？所以我就噉樣引申到呢個週一樂安居縮咗就咁解啦。繼續講嗱，頭先我話政府反對即係為呢個額外印花税定立入岸條款個理據係講唔通嘅。OK，你話。

1624
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:41,140
不可能揣測日後市場變化，大佬你話畀人聽，十年內之內起四十七萬個單位㗎嘛？

1625
04:03:41,420 --> 04:03:46,340
係咪個市場喺你手度㗎嘛？講嘢。

1626
04:03:47,950 --> 04:03:59,400
即係你呢一個噉嘅供應，公司型房屋四十七萬，未來十年，你係係成個市場喺供應方面就出現一個轉變啦，係咪？

1627
04:03:59,680 --> 04:04:04,400
除非你話畀我聽，你個政府又係揾我襯，噉啊冇得講啦，係咪先？

1628
04:04:05,110 --> 04:04:07,570
嗱，即係。

1629
04:04:08,310 --> 04:04:09,660
如果，

1630
04:04:09,940 --> 04:04:29,950
政府嗰個承諾喺四十七萬個單位兑現嘅話，佢個樓價就可能又會出現回落嘅情況。到時呢個外印花税咧啊，就會窒礙到本地即係啊呢個香港永久居民買樓係咪？你會對佢有影響啊嘛？係咪？

1631
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:40,070
所以當呢個本地市民購買力足以應付市場嘅價格嘅時候，即係話你公屋又起咗好多，啊居屋又起係嘛噉。

1632
04:04:40,350 --> 04:04:43,140
又拋出去市場度，有人去買。

1633
04:04:44,040 --> 04:04:52,640
噉你就應該要取消呢個額外印花税啦嘛，啱唔啱啊？好，呢個從排外條款嗰個角度出發啦，係咪？相反。

1634
04:04:52,920 --> 04:05:04,250
同額外印花税唔同，買家印花税係針對本地，即係非本地買家嗰個，即係令到佢提高佢嗰個置業嘅成即係成本，唔係或者炒樓嘅成本。

1635
04:05:04,540 --> 04:05:24,550
即係好似政府成日講嘅，誒，我哋香港經濟咧喺個外向型經濟嚇，好容易受外圍經濟波動影響啊。因此咧，如果對呢個買家印花税定落日落定立呢個日落條款，就無疑係恢復非本地買家嘅炒賣活動。

1636
04:05:24,550 --> 04:05:44,560
講嗱，買家印花税嘅原意係增加外來資金進入本地住宅市場嘅炒賣成本，並非針對本地人嘅正常即係置業嘅活動，係嘛？香港經濟體係喺外圍事實上存著大量熱錢，因此即使呢個買家印花税。

1637
04:05:44,560 --> 04:06:04,570
係非常時期嘅非常手段，但係買價印花税都不宜喺短期內取消，係嘛？因為呢個非常時期講緊可能唔係兩三年嘅，係咪？所以而家你定呢個日落條款嘅時間咧，我哋就唔會接受，係嘛？所以即係呢個係我哋嘅立場好清晰嘅，係咪？即係。

1638
04:06:04,570 --> 04:06:11,570
我哋支持即係呢個為買家印花税定立入落條款，但係反對。

1639
04:06:12,090 --> 04:06:17,240
即係為呢個額外印花税訂立入落條款，多謝主席，林大輝議員。

1640
04:06:18,950 --> 04:06:20,020
多謝主席。

1641
04:06:20,650 --> 04:06:40,660
主席，誒，我好明白，即係亦都好理解政府推出今次嘅辣椒嘅雙辣椒嘅原意，即係希望將呢個樓價降温啦，樓市降温啦，就減少咗呢個市場嗰個泡沫風險啦。呢個我係理解嘅。

1642
04:06:40,900 --> 04:06:43,400
所以政府講話呢個政策係。

1643
04:06:43,720 --> 04:06:49,300
特殊特辦、特殊政策、臨時性嘅措施，呢個我都係同意嘅。

1644
04:06:49,610 --> 04:06:53,620
不過，政府咧必須明白咧，任何政策咧。

1645
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:59,810
就必須有利，必係有利有弊嘅，因為根本世界上冇完美嘅政策嘅。

1646
04:07:00,280 --> 04:07:02,820
事實上，就算幾好嘅政策咧。

1647
04:07:03,180 --> 04:07:05,700
都會係有後遺症。

1648
04:07:05,990 --> 04:07:12,210
同埋副作用嘅，所以個執行個政策咧，絕對係不能夠墨守成規嘅。

1649
04:07:12,490 --> 04:07:16,970
亦都唔好諗住啲政策咧行之有效，永遠都啱用嘅。

1650
04:07:17,470 --> 04:07:19,280
即係呢個政策咧。

1651
04:07:20,880 --> 04:07:25,700
大家推咗出嚟之後，好多人都批評係扭曲咗呢個商業嘅行為。

1652
04:07:26,210 --> 04:07:28,660
破壞咗香港嘅自由經濟模式。

1653
04:07:29,090 --> 04:07:31,460
話用行政嘅幹預咧。

1654
04:07:31,740 --> 04:07:35,480
係引起咗好多人對呢個討論。

1655
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:40,280
咁所以，我覺得政府喺執行上咧，必須係要靈活嘅。

1656
04:07:40,970 --> 04:07:48,470
必須咧係睇住個形勢去變通，去改變個計劃嘅，其中時間性係非常之重要嘅。

1657
04:07:48,970 --> 04:07:53,270
即係，正如剛才我講，呢個政策咧，就算幾好，都會有利有弊。

1658
04:07:53,800 --> 04:08:02,020
啊！帶嚟副作用就好似而家啲當當，而家個樓市好似啲癌症噉樣，你而家落啲標靶藥去醫佢。

1659
04:08:02,300 --> 04:08:04,320
可能一時之間有效。

1660
04:08:04,810 --> 04:08:20,110
但係亦都唔係長期有效。但係依個過程中咧，呢啲標靶藥雖然對癌症好有用喎，但係可能帶來醫療上嘅喺個過程上個病人好多其他嘅痛苦喎，又甩頭髮啊，啊又又又作嘔啊。

1661
04:08:20,720 --> 04:08:24,060
所以咧，呢方面咧，政府必須明白到嘅。

1662
04:08:24,340 --> 04:08:27,390
剛才阿鬱敏就講話呢個政策排外。

1663
04:08:27,970 --> 04:08:34,130
噉我又佢又錯唔得曬嘅，但我又唔同意講排外，最頂期量係半排外。

1664
04:08:34,530 --> 04:08:54,540
點解半排嘅咧？因為大家對國家嘅觀念唔同，佢又當內地人咧就係外人。我啊，老實講，我對中國所有同胞都係自己人嘅，所以我啊永遠都唔會用排外嘅。當然呢個政策咧係係同時係適用於非香港永久性居民，包括。

1665
04:08:54,540 --> 04:09:03,340
係內地人，以至係即係外國人啦，所以所以咧就半排外。但其實我覺得呢個政策咧，嚴格嚟講叫做港客政策。

1666
04:09:03,620 --> 04:09:05,610
港客啊，廣州啲客啊！

1667
04:09:06,700 --> 04:09:12,930
即係其實就等於其實你同限奶令冇分別嘅啫嘛，限住人買兩罐奶粉嘅啫嘛。

1668
04:09:13,410 --> 04:09:15,740
啊嘛，遲啲你。

1669
04:09:16,830 --> 04:09:21,310
煙税加時限住人食少，希望人食少啲煙咁解啫嘛～

1670
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:24,570
冇分別嘅啫，係港客啫嘛。

1671
04:09:25,170 --> 04:09:26,970
咁呢個港客政策咧？

1672
04:09:27,630 --> 04:09:29,170
最開心邊個咧？

1673
04:09:29,940 --> 04:09:38,690
嗱，如果我哋港客政策冇，我一定要帶埋入落條款嚟講，咪主席係停我嘅。呢個港客如果冇入落條款咧，最可心咩？

1674
04:09:39,160 --> 04:09:44,180
其他鄰近個國家咯，因為嗰啲人民走去鄰近國家投資咯。

1675
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:50,900
最開心啊！我哋成日講英美勢力嗰啲啊，光與香港嗰啲啊，咪去咗英國投資咯。

1676
04:09:51,200 --> 04:09:52,980
去到日本投資咯。

1677
04:09:53,260 --> 04:10:06,950
去到新加坡投資咯，趕走曬啲客，呢客一趕走啊，唔係聽日你叫翻嚟就翻嚟㗎啦。你試下去茶餐廳飲茶，去趕走你，你聽日會唔會去翻個茶餐廳飲啊？都唔會㗎嘛，呢樣嘢。

1678
04:10:08,020 --> 04:10:18,510
所以講下政策咧，就必須有後遺症，有時間性。講講下就要停㗎啦。如果講講下你唔停咧，你要執笠㗎，你要關門大吉㗎啦。

1679
04:10:18,790 --> 04:10:21,000
點可以一路講啊，一路咁講落去啊！

1680
04:10:21,330 --> 04:10:24,150
唔可以㗎，有計劃性講嘛。

1681
04:10:25,110 --> 04:10:38,450
講啊，啊講係唔係講嘢講係講啊！我諗主席你唔糾正我，你糾正我冇長相啊嘛！除咗黃曉明議員之外，冇乜人有能力可以講走啲人嘅。啊，講走啲客係啦。

1682
04:10:38,730 --> 04:10:42,970
主席，你又唔啱啊！你成日抖正佢，唔抖正我，等我出咗洋相嚇。

1683
04:10:44,430 --> 04:10:54,800
咁嗱，主席，今朝我咧從個微觀個角度去分析個日落條款啦，就話即係用一個香港人嘅人生觀啊、價值觀啊。

1684
04:10:55,080 --> 04:11:15,090
去睇下點樣講個人生事業嘅大計，覺得需要入落條件，因為入落條件有咗之後咧，人就可以計劃佢個事業啦。噉啊，呢節我係想用個宏觀經濟嚟講下。啊，剛才我講話窒礙咗呢個商業行為啊。啊，講講下係咪啊？啊，講啊，講講下，即係朝。

1685
04:11:15,090 --> 04:11:22,750
即係我潮州人啊，新界啊，發哥，你唔好成日叫我講新界話啊，搞到我啲新界就噉。噉我覺得你有啲離題啦，但係好對唔住啊，主席。

1686
04:11:23,910 --> 04:11:31,580
即係我覺得，如果你冇呢個日落條款咧，除咗剛才我講帶嚟呢個商業危機之外，呢個經濟發展危機之外，

1687
04:11:31,860 --> 04:11:34,140
其實仲會帶來一個政治危機。

1688
04:11:34,430 --> 04:11:37,260
仲會衝擊呢個一國兩制嘅危機。

1689
04:11:37,700 --> 04:11:39,530
何來政治危機啊？

1690
04:11:39,880 --> 04:11:54,360
喂！呢個政策你唔好寫明就，其實你係針對內地人嚟投資啊嘛！你嗰陣時係話報紙報道啦，你哋都成日講啦，內地人如果發達啦啊，經濟起飛啦，大把錢嚟香港炒樓，即係又唔使按揭。

1691
04:11:54,750 --> 04:12:00,980
嗱，講真啲，佢你唔敢寫落文件度啫嘛，你係針對唔畀內地客人嚟買樓嘛。

1692
04:12:01,290 --> 04:12:07,740
啊，所以就加重佢個成本啊嘛！喂，過去中央政府啊，推出咁多政策啊。

1693
04:12:08,020 --> 04:12:12,100
都係惠及香港同胞嘅，點解香港要推出一個政策？

1694
04:12:12,880 --> 04:12:15,000
係要打擊同胞啊！

1695
04:12:16,720 --> 04:12:25,990
當然啦，以市民唔知道，以為我而家做緊乜嘢？其實你想增加供應去解決樓市降温最有效，就唔係通過啲加税啊嘛。

1696
04:12:26,270 --> 04:12:39,810
而且加税仲連香港個註冊公司都唔畀，仲一刀切殃及池魚添啦。我認為呢啲説話亦都應該係喺二讀辯論。唔係唔係唔係，我只講入落條件，佢要有政治問題啊？點解咧？如果你冇入落條件？

1697
04:12:40,370 --> 04:13:00,380
呢個潮氛係事實，就令到內地好多同胞好興㗎，內地好多投資者好激氣㗎。佢覺得國家成日惠及你香港，點解你香港政府咁愚昧制定啲政策針對我？你唔可以單單針對嘅政，係針對外國人咩？你外國人嘅就要加香港人唔誒內地同胞唔使加都得㗎嘛。其實，

1698
04:13:00,380 --> 04:13:06,150
講嚟講去就針對埋佢，咁所以如果呢個呢個對立呢個仇視。

1699
04:13:06,670 --> 04:13:09,650
啊！或者呢個關係一路路保持唔落去，唔好。

1700
04:13:10,210 --> 04:13:14,870
個關係會去到一個一個一個一個一個點咧，就破裂㗎嘛。

1701
04:13:16,170 --> 04:13:36,180
咁所以咧一定要有日落條款，就話畀佢聽，我哋特事特辦誒，你哋忍住先啦，唔好買住先啦，等我揾到地方起咗公屋，起咗居屋啊，我氹掂啲地產商啊，噉啊放啲地出嚟，早啲推出啲私樓出嚟，或者抵冧啲啊，唔好。

1702
04:13:36,180 --> 04:13:45,530
冇我麵粉貴啫，你哋做麵包平少少啦，幫幫政府依法施政啦。我即係氹掂咗之後，市場供應咪大咯。你畀三年時間我。

1703
04:13:46,050 --> 04:13:49,130
三年時間，我就可以搞掂硫磺化，可以。

1704
04:13:49,410 --> 04:13:51,490
新東北發展順利推出㗎啦！

1705
04:13:52,230 --> 04:14:06,930
三年啦，發哥，三年好傾掂佢啦，咁咪香港人受惠受受害㗎，啱嘛？畀三年時間我，呢個日落條款就咁啦，可以喺個時間度逼政府做嘢，喺呢個時三個三年內去諗掂點供應。

1706
04:14:08,010 --> 04:14:15,490
啱唔啱？諗點點樣釋放土地？唔好空口講白話。咁內地政府就同啲。

1707
04:14:15,770 --> 04:14:25,990
內地投資者講：忍下三年啦，為著香港繁繁榮安定，為著我哋要落實一呢個港人治港，畀三年時間佢啦。

1708
04:14:26,490 --> 04:14:34,690
係忍下啦，唔好唔好唔好激氣啦噉樣。所以呢個時間性好重好重要，每一個人都有忍耐期嘅，你畀個忍耐期佢。

1709
04:14:35,190 --> 04:14:37,190
喂，另一個我。

1710
04:14:37,470 --> 04:14:42,260
啊，主席，你冇話我離題啊！其實對一國兩制衝擊好大嘅。

1711
04:14:42,540 --> 04:15:00,510
所以咩一國兩制你都知啦。香港行資本主義，內地行特色特色嘅社會主義。而家攞所謂內地嘅特色社會主義，咦？唔係好似以前嘅計劃經濟嘅冇離題，冇離題。我解釋起身就唔離題嘅。請你講翻第十七條同埋啊，日落條款嘛，日落條款啊嘛。

1712
04:15:00,840 --> 04:15:07,630
一六條款嘛，所以我意思話，而家我哋係國內地政府領導成，要我哋唔好乾預個市場。

1713
04:15:07,910 --> 04:15:09,870
等個市場自動調節。

1714
04:15:10,360 --> 04:15:13,310
自動調節咧係最自然、最有效嘅。

1715
04:15:13,590 --> 04:15:15,790
噉我哋自己搞個江魚。

1716
04:15:16,190 --> 04:15:36,200
啱啊！咁當然，中央政府咧明白你呢個光雨係因為特事特辦，但中央政府都希望你有個時間㗎嘛。如果唔係搞架，你走咗資本主義，走咗社會主義嘅個制度點搞啊？噉啊唔成功一國兩一國兩制咯，變咗一國一制咯，大融合咯，你走去走社會主義。

1717
04:15:36,200 --> 04:15:42,160
光與市場，我啊內地就走資本主義，開放市場，搞搞變咗一國一制。

1718
04:15:42,550 --> 04:15:44,660
咁咪咪衝擊咗一國兩制咯！

1719
04:15:45,390 --> 04:15:50,070
噉啊！真係你啊，真係做咗立大功啦，大融合啦，唔使等五十年啦。

1720
04:15:51,370 --> 04:15:54,370
所以，局長，你必須用時間證明。

1721
04:15:54,650 --> 04:15:57,980
我呢個江雨係短暫性嘅。

1722
04:15:58,390 --> 04:16:00,850
嚇係臨時性嘅。

1723
04:16:02,190 --> 04:16:20,950
要話畀中央政府聽，我唔係想改變我哋個資本主義制度，我哋都唔係想走去社會主義、特色社會主義，我哋唔係想計劃經濟，唔係想幹預市場，同你嘅管理大領導大思維係違反你嘅。你叫我哋唔好乾預市場，我係幹預市場，哇！好鬼惡過你，即係山高皇帝遠啊！

1724
04:16:21,230 --> 04:16:23,960
咁所以，我覺得咧係一定有個時間性嘅。

1725
04:16:24,800 --> 04:16:27,710
所以為咗咧，唔好影響商業嘅。

1726
04:16:28,110 --> 04:16:30,600
發展香港未來商業發展。

1727
04:16:31,090 --> 04:16:32,110
唔好。

1728
04:16:32,520 --> 04:16:35,560
製造政治嘅危機，冇衝擊。

1729
04:16:35,840 --> 04:16:42,500
一國兩制呢個模式，我希望局長咧考慮喺新買家印花税入邊咧。

1730
04:16:43,220 --> 04:16:47,640
係接受呢個一落條款。主席，本日緊接陳詞。杜根新議。

1731
04:16:50,900 --> 04:17:00,610
誒主席，就誒我一點誒之前冇講到嘅咧，就係因為有一位同事就係誒或者幾位同事啦嚇，包括誒李慧瓊議員咧。

1732
04:17:00,930 --> 04:17:07,880
都誒，位局長咧，都曾經喺以前位今次咧講過咧，就係話日落條款咧。

1733
04:17:08,500 --> 04:17:14,830
就唔應該嘅，因為咧冇人係可預知到幾時先應該。

1734
04:17:15,110 --> 04:17:17,930
係要退市，或者誒？

1735
04:17:19,520 --> 04:17:22,520
誒，依個法例唔應該再使用啦，噉。

1736
04:17:23,370 --> 04:17:27,630
就或者咧，誒冇人喺有水晶球在手噉。

1737
04:17:28,140 --> 04:17:28,900
主席。

1738
04:17:29,540 --> 04:17:37,200
但係我哋而家咧，依個日落條款，當然日落條款有好多種啦嚇。OK，但係我哋而家呢個討緊討論緊呢四款啦嚇。OK。

1739
04:17:38,490 --> 04:17:45,050
我哋唔係定一個日子，譬如話誒，一年後、九個月後噉，或兩年後噉。

1740
04:17:45,390 --> 04:17:46,440
然後咧。

1741
04:17:46,720 --> 04:17:49,350
冇啦，冇咗，誒，突然間冇咗噉。

1742
04:17:50,460 --> 04:17:53,040
而係寫到明咧。

1743
04:17:53,320 --> 04:18:02,830
係可以喺嗰個第下邊另一條條款咧，同一個題裏邊咧，就話無論係立法會或者局長咧。

1744
04:18:03,440 --> 04:18:04,990
係可以咧。

1745
04:18:05,440 --> 04:18:06,450
去修訂。

1746
04:18:07,270 --> 04:18:09,130
仲有個修訂咧，呢度咧。

1747
04:18:09,410 --> 04:18:17,510
已經係冇好似誒有另外一啲嘅日落條款噉樣咧，就係話只係誒不多於兩年。

1748
04:18:18,130 --> 04:18:28,280
OK，冇喎，所以呢個其實係好與人方便嘅。即係換句話講，你下一次如果你真係認為需要咧，理論上如果議員又同意咧，你可以改成。

1749
04:18:28,560 --> 04:18:30,710
啊！另外三年。

1750
04:18:30,990 --> 04:18:36,880
都得個，或者五年都得。當然，如果你話另外十年咁噉，我我又覺得奇怪啲啦，係嘛噉。

1751
04:18:37,310 --> 04:18:38,440
咁但係咧。

1752
04:18:38,720 --> 04:18:44,380
就唔係話我哋去到某一日咧，就自動停咗，停咗之後咧就冇啦噉。

1753
04:18:44,660 --> 04:19:03,700
咁當然你即係退一萬步講，噉你可以拗，你話都唔係停咗冇嘅，噉你喺停嗰日之前，誒能夠通過一個三讀嘅一讀、二讀、三讀修訂條例，咁可以改咯，咁啱係，因為用例改乜都得㗎啦噉，但係嗰個可能係比較長啊，比較麻煩啦。

1754
04:19:03,980 --> 04:19:07,090
咁但係你記住喎，而家呢度咧係講緊一個附屬法例喎。

1755
04:19:07,580 --> 04:19:15,150
咁即係換句話講咧，有啲同事猛話冇人可以預知到幾時咧，就其實就唔唔通嘅，因為。

1756
04:19:15,430 --> 04:19:16,770
個意思就係。

1757
04:19:17,120 --> 04:19:23,770
嗰個日子咧，其實係你會定一個稍為遠嘅日子，但係就個意思即係。

1758
04:19:24,050 --> 04:19:39,110
係表明唔係無限期嘅，唔係即係呢個法例有別於其他我哋制定咗咁多嘅條例咧，係冇日落條款，就因為我哋認為嗰啲係一路有效嘅，直至到修訂為止。

1759
04:19:39,450 --> 04:19:41,070
但係呢個咧就唔係。

1760
04:19:41,500 --> 04:19:44,310
呢個咧係臨時措施，係特別措施。

1761
04:19:44,850 --> 04:19:53,380
所以我即係呢個問題咧，就係唔好再講話咩有冇水晶球，唔係噉嘅意思，唔係某一日就自動消滅，唔係噉樣。

1762
04:19:53,890 --> 04:19:56,010
第二咧就係啊。

1763
04:19:57,400 --> 04:19:59,970
有有位同事咧就講，佢話。

1764
04:20:00,360 --> 04:20:20,370
喂，我哋而家係討論緊而家呢個日落條款，唔係討論緊一般嘅日落條款，係討論緊呢四款啫。我皆知啦，因為如果我講一般嘅條款，但係到最後呢四款咧，其實係有我所講嘅一般嘅條款裏邊嘅主體嘅特質喺裏邊。

1765
04:20:22,270 --> 04:20:23,900
呢四款裏邊。

1766
04:20:24,190 --> 04:20:36,700
嗰個分別喺邊度咧？因為因為我我似乎見到李慧瓊議主席佢代表我哋委員會咧，佢都冇特別講呢四款係乜嘢，而其他誒提出嗰幾位誒。

1767
04:20:37,080 --> 04:20:39,080
啊，係啊！

1768
04:20:39,420 --> 04:20:58,410
同時咧，即係喺委員會提出，而而而希望誒委員會設立成為誒誒委員會嘅修訂，令李慧瓊主席提出咧，都都冇提。解呢四款有咩分別咧？有好多人可能冇冇冇留意到，我覺得都要解解釋一下嗱。誒，李慧瓊議員主席代表我哋提嘅第一款咧。

1769
04:20:58,870 --> 04:20:59,750
就係。

1770
04:21:00,240 --> 04:21:03,730
個日子咧就係一四年十二月三十一號。

1771
04:21:04,540 --> 04:21:21,840
咁呢個咧，我我先講主席，我哋認為民主黨都認為咧，呢個係太近嘅。OK，噉我都我都反對嘅，我哋都。不過佢嘅意義咧就係話，佢定一個就係一四年尾。咁當然佢同佢嘅原原因嘅意義，啊張耀仁議員都講過，就係兩年啊嘛，就係當時引入嘅時候兩年。

1772
04:21:22,170 --> 04:21:26,180
但係咧，佢嗰個誒能夠。

1773
04:21:26,460 --> 04:21:32,340
去延續或者咁講咧，延續呢個生效嘅日期咧，就由局長提出。

1774
04:21:33,160 --> 04:21:34,370
正係局長啫。

1775
04:21:35,840 --> 04:21:39,620
但係跟住第二款咧，即係第二第二個修訂咧。

1776
04:21:39,900 --> 04:21:42,720
李慧瓊議員提過修訂咧，就係立法會。

1777
04:21:43,030 --> 04:21:46,230
立法會嘅意思咧，即係話咧，其實係議員都得嘅。

1778
04:21:46,650 --> 04:21:48,720
議員又得，局長又得。

1779
04:21:49,000 --> 04:21:55,180
OK，但係個日子咧就係誒一五年十月廿六號，OK。

1780
04:21:55,460 --> 04:22:01,450
咁而第三款咧就係一四年十二月三十一號，就淨係局，依睇先啦，所以。

1781
04:22:04,490 --> 04:22:15,390
誒局誒係附件七嗰度係誒一四年十二月三十一號嗰度就係咧嗰個B S D，然後咧就係局長提出。

1782
04:22:15,670 --> 04:22:22,320
然後跟住嗰個咧就係一五年十月廿六號就係買家印花税，但係立法會都係提出。咁即係換句話講咧。

1783
04:22:22,600 --> 04:22:24,140
如果有同事認為，

1784
04:22:24,780 --> 04:22:27,100
唔可以立法會議員提出嘅。

1785
04:22:27,380 --> 04:22:28,810
只可以。

1786
04:22:29,190 --> 04:22:32,770
政府提出，噉你咪贊成政府提出嗰個嗰嗰款咯噉。

1787
04:22:33,120 --> 04:22:39,370
噉就係我即係話咧，其實你問議員係咪可以提出咧？我覺得議員都應該有呢個立法權嘅。

1788
04:22:40,690 --> 04:22:44,560
我舉翻較早我講過前講過嘅就係租管。

1789
04:22:44,840 --> 04:22:48,750
事實上，其中有一次嘅嗰幾十年嘅租管嘅延續咧。

1790
04:22:49,170 --> 04:22:52,000
有一次嘅兩年嘅延續咧，係我提出嘅。

1791
04:22:52,440 --> 04:22:55,530
咁嗰陣時，我記得房屋師咧就係。

1792
04:22:55,810 --> 04:22:58,450
啊，房屋因為房屋師咧。

1793
04:22:59,050 --> 04:23:00,530
就係誒。

1794
04:23:01,560 --> 04:23:09,030
死啦！真係事唔記得咗啲，唔緊要啊！即係佢咧就猛喺度話咧就唔應該提出噉，咁但係最後咧都獲通過嘅。

1795
04:23:09,870 --> 04:23:17,410
誒，所以咧，當然，如果議員真係要提出係去誒延續嘅話，

1796
04:23:17,690 --> 04:23:21,940
咁當然啦，佢亦都有啲理據，點解要延續啦？佢想同時啦。

1797
04:23:22,220 --> 04:23:29,740
亦都要講點解佢延續嗰一日係大致上咧係可以接受嘅一個日子。

1798
04:23:30,320 --> 04:23:32,390
如果佢太近，啲人話冇意思嘅。

1799
04:23:32,670 --> 04:23:34,840
一一一講快又要檢討啦噉。

1800
04:23:35,240 --> 04:23:39,220
如果太遠嘅，噉啊，即係根本講，亦都冇意思。

1801
04:23:39,500 --> 04:23:45,070
咁所以佢一定咧，通常咧，大約啦呢啲噉嘅日落條款咧，一般嚟講咧，係真係兩三年。

1802
04:23:45,480 --> 04:23:48,680
咁其實好多時，政府如果真係，

1803
04:23:48,980 --> 04:23:54,660
喺兩三年之內，即係個日期之內，係認為根本應該要退市咧。

1804
04:23:55,180 --> 04:24:02,110
你噉你唔你你唔緊要㗎，你可以嚇嚟到啊去用。

1805
04:24:02,390 --> 04:24:04,870
再快啲嘅方式嚟到做。

1806
04:24:05,540 --> 04:24:10,620
就係你，如果而家通過咗啦，冇辦法啦，琴晚納入咗啦，就係嗰個附屬法例嘅形式。

1807
04:24:11,080 --> 04:24:17,910
咁所以你其實係絕對咧變相，如果你想早過呢日子完結咧，其實咧取消將個税咧變得零就得㗎啦。

1808
04:24:18,190 --> 04:24:24,700
就已經完結咗啦，已經個效率已經冇咗啦噉，咁所以咧就政府延長係可以。

1809
04:24:25,290 --> 04:24:35,830
縮短就用取消附屬法例嗰度，誒誒誒税率嗰度啊，咁所以咧就係係一個係誒互相緊扣嘅誒方方式嚟嘅。

1810
04:24:39,940 --> 04:24:41,680
有冇其他委員要發言？

1811
04:24:47,790 --> 04:24:49,940
郭榮亨議員，你是否要再次發言？

1812
04:24:53,210 --> 04:24:54,950
主席，我無需再次發言。

1813
04:24:56,550 --> 04:24:58,290
局長，你是否要再次發言？

1814
04:25:01,450 --> 04:25:02,480
主席。

1815
04:25:03,390 --> 04:25:13,120
政府不能同意郭榮亨議員提出建議，將政府撤回有關未成年嘅買家印花税豁免嘅修正案。

1816
04:25:13,560 --> 04:25:17,110
延遲生效嘅誒誒修正案。

1817
04:25:17,530 --> 04:25:26,190
政府亦都認為李慧瓊議員所代表法案委員會一啲委員提出日落條款嘅修正案不能接受。

1818
04:25:26,470 --> 04:25:31,900
我會先解釋政府對各議員所提出嘅修正案嘅立場。

1819
04:25:33,150 --> 04:25:53,160
較早前，本委員會係通過政府所接納原先係由葉劉淑儀議員提出嘅修正案，係撤回所有未成年嘅香港永久性居民透過受託人或者係監護人購買住宅物業時，可獲豁免買家人花税。

1820
04:25:53,230 --> 04:25:57,970
以回應法案委員會非常憂慮。

1821
04:25:58,250 --> 04:26:09,590
為咗未成年嘅香港永久性居民作出買家印花税嘅全面安排，係容易被濫用，從而係削弱買家印花税嘅成效。

1822
04:26:12,930 --> 04:26:14,240
局長，請你等一等。

1823
04:26:14,810 --> 04:26:15,750
嗯。

1824
04:26:16,120 --> 04:26:16,960
秘書。

1825
04:26:17,450 --> 04:26:18,630
向終結人生。

1826
04:28:45,710 --> 04:28:46,990
唔一定要兩點鐘要。

1827
04:38:13,130 --> 04:38:13,910
局長。

1828
04:38:14,330 --> 04:38:14,900
嗯。

1829
04:38:17,190 --> 04:38:18,470
主席，我繼續。

1830
04:38:18,790 --> 04:38:21,060
誒，各議員嘅修正案。

1831
04:38:21,340 --> 04:38:41,350
係建議上述誒嘅政府修正案咧，係不應應用喺修訂條例草案、修訂條例刊憲前所作出嘅交易。政府係不能接受呢個噉嘅建議嘅。原則上，政府原先提交嘅條例草案當中再列嘅各項豁免。

1832
04:38:41,350 --> 04:38:46,140
安排係代表政府就買家印花税建議嘅執行方案。

1833
04:38:46,550 --> 04:38:59,650
一月所有嘅條例草案，呢條條例草案在正式成為法律之前，係必須喺立法程序中經過充分討論。佢嘅內容亦都可能咧係會被修訂嘅。

1834
04:38:59,930 --> 04:39:11,270
立法會如果認為有需要，亦都可以對條例草案提出任何嘅修訂。市民係唔應該有所謂法案必定通過嘅不合理期望。

1835
04:39:11,580 --> 04:39:19,170
剛才我聽到郭議員同埋其他一啲議員所講，的確呢一條嘅條例草案係有關於。

1836
04:39:19,690 --> 04:39:38,100
買家印花税同埋係增強嘅額外印花税呢兩項嘅税項咧，都係屬於非常時期嘅非常措施。咁因此咧，呢個條例草案係包括有一個追索力，但係我哋覺得根本問題咧就係任何嘅。

1837
04:39:38,610 --> 04:39:46,300
法例任何嘅條例草案喺立法過程當中，嗰個所謂明確性、穩定性同埋非穩定性。

1838
04:39:46,610 --> 04:40:06,620
就以我哋今日呢條二零一二年印花税修訂條例草案為例，我哋到今日呢個時間咧已經討論咗係超過二十五個鐘頭，但係最終嚟講，呢個條例草案能唔能夠被通過咧，仍然係一個問題嘅，所以係好難去。

1839
04:40:06,620 --> 04:40:25,360
確定究竟個明確性係點樣去睇？市民可能好多都期望啊，呢個條例草案最終係被通過。但係，假如唔通過嘅時候，咁究竟要係立法嘅不明確性咧，因為明確性咧，我覺得係唔容易去去講得清楚。

1840
04:40:25,780 --> 04:40:35,790
翻返去而家呢個呢個修正案，事實上咧未成年香港永久性居民嘅買家印花税豁免，誒呢個修正案咧。

1841
04:40:36,200 --> 04:40:56,210
政府亦都係基於立法會嘅議員同其他嘅持份者提出嘅意見同埋回應咧，係提出誒呢個誒誒修正案嘅，同埋亦都有其他嘅修正案咧。政府都係有提出嚟，例如話咧係改善為重建項目係退回馬街印花税。

1842
04:40:56,210 --> 04:41:02,740
嘅機制啦，呢個喺個審議過程裏邊，到最後政府係接納法案委員會意見，如果作出一個修訂。

1843
04:41:03,030 --> 04:41:23,040
議員本身亦都提出咗唔同嘅修正案，有一啲修正案亦都係誒目的咧係擴闊呢個條例草案底下嘅全面安排，亦都有啲係誒目的咧係收緊呢個安排。假如呢啲修正案係未通過嘅話咧，亦都會對喺誒從二零一二年誒二零一二年十月份。

1844
04:41:23,040 --> 04:41:35,590
開始係受到我哋依個新措施影響嘅人士咧，可能佢都會聲稱咧係受到影響。咁所以喺原則上，我哋認為咧係誒。

1845
04:41:35,940 --> 04:41:55,070
只有喺立法會完成審議條例草案，並且喺修訂條例草案刊憲之後，啊，咁有關我哋誒，希望能夠誒落實嘅呢個加強誒後嘅額外印花税同埋買家印花税嘅制度咧，個運作咧先係真係去去實施嘅。

1846
04:41:56,510 --> 04:42:16,520
我哋認為唔應該將政府嘅修正案應用喺誒修訂條例刊憲前，即係國員所提出由未成年嘅誒香港永久性居民透過受託人及監護人購買住宅物業嘅交易嘅建議咧，同處理條。

1847
04:42:16,520 --> 04:42:36,530
草案嘅既定原則咧，係並不符合，亦都可能會對公眾就買家印花税機製造成不必要嘅困惑。如果認同有關豁免安排可能出現潛在漏洞嘅同時，又容讓部分交易啊，無論多少都好，係可以繼續享有有關豁免，依個同政府。

1848
04:42:36,530 --> 04:42:43,820
府同埋法案委員會希望係確保買家印花税嘅成效，呢種共同意願咧係並不一致嘅。

1849
04:42:44,390 --> 04:43:00,870
仲有一樣就係呢個建議會為有意利用啊相關潛在漏洞嘅人士咧，係提供誘因，係鼓勵佢哋咧喺一個過渡期裏邊係藉住利用未成年人士名義購買住宅物業嚟到去逃避呢個買家人發税。

1850
04:43:01,200 --> 04:43:18,720
各議員嘅修正案亦都可能會提供呢個機會，因為佢個修正案如果通過之後咧，呢個條例草案呢個條修正條例啊刊憲之前咧係有一段日子嘅啊，雖然咧係幾天都好啦，但係因為我哋講緊咧係一啲以

1851
04:43:19,450 --> 04:43:27,050
八萬計嘅誒住宅物業，同埋咧百分之十五嘅買家印花税税率咧，佢唔係一個小嘅數目。

1852
04:43:28,260 --> 04:43:36,420
咁所以原則上咧，政府係唔能夠接納各議員嘅修正案，亦都希望各位議員咧係慎重考慮政府呢方面嘅顧慮。

1853
04:43:37,070 --> 04:43:51,980
較早前，税局、税務局喺網頁裏邊就買家印花税嘅常見問題嘅前當中咧，的確係已經清楚指出買家印花税制度每代相關條例草案完成修訂後落實。

1854
04:43:52,730 --> 04:44:09,590
之後喺政府決定接納葉劉淑儀員嘅修正案，並且係通知立法會有關嘅決定之後咧，啊啊會提出一個政府修正案呢個決定之後咧，税務局亦都隨即係更新佢個網頁，係通知公眾最新嘅建議安排。

1855
04:44:10,700 --> 04:44:14,950
至於李慧瓊議員代表法案委員會。

1856
04:44:15,230 --> 04:44:35,240
嘅委員提誒動議引入日落條款嘅修訂案，正如我哋多次提出，政府真係冇水晶球，我哋唔係話誒去誒重複過去講過嘅論調，我哋唔可能咧係去揣測市場嘅變化同埋各項嘅外圍。

1857
04:44:35,240 --> 04:44:36,030
噉，所以。

1858
04:44:36,310 --> 04:44:54,890
並且係隨意咧，係設定一日期，無論係一年又好，兩年又好，從而估預計咧，呢個需求管理措施係咩時候咧，係唔再需要、唔再適用。因此去制定任何硬性嘅入落條款，只係會發放誒錯誤嘅市場信息誒。

1859
04:44:55,170 --> 04:45:04,710
客觀上會刺激呢個需求，包括啲投機性嘅需求，係增加市場波動，係影響到咧需求管理措施嘅誒效力嘅。

1860
04:45:06,090 --> 04:45:26,100
有議員係就問：咁究竟政府用乜嘢指標嚟到決定將來對呢啲需求管理措施嘅調整或者撤撤銷？嗱，政府當然係會繼續參考有關嘅指標，啊密切地去監察呢個樓市嘅狀況。實際上，樓市係受好多內外嘅因素。

1861
04:45:26,100 --> 04:45:46,110
數所影響嘅，包括宏觀經濟環境、我哋嘅利率同埋資金嘅狀況，同埋市場嘅供求狀況。政府一直係會參考不同嘅指標嚟到去監察呢個物業市場嘅變化，包括咧，但係亦都唔限於樓價、置業負擔能力、物業嘅成交。

1862
04:45:46,110 --> 04:45:50,420
供量、供求嘅平衡，以及係按揭貸款嘅增長。

1863
04:45:50,700 --> 04:46:09,830
仲有就係本地同埋外圍嘅經濟因素嘅變化，例如其他國家同埋地區因應市場形勢而推出一啲嘅措施，呢啲措施對香港嘅誒經濟環境嘅影響。啊，歐美國家調整同埋撤回量化寬鬆政策嘅步伐等等。

1864
04:46:10,110 --> 04:46:30,120
咁所以可以睇到咧，影響香港樓市發展嘅因素其實係誒好多方面嘅，亦都係複雜多變嘅，同埋因素之間咧，亦都係會有互動嘅關係。有啲因素會刺激到或者影響到其他因素，係冇一個單一嘅指標，更加係冇一個可以能夠好簡單。

1865
04:46:30,120 --> 04:46:50,130
地去量化有個數字，有個百分比噉嘅指標咧，嚟到係完全去反映呢個物業市場嘅狀況。所以誒，政府咧係唔可以，亦都唔會咧係只係睇個別指標嚟到咧係作一個決定。但係當然我哋要參考所有相關指標，同埋咧誒佢哋互動之間所產生出。

1866
04:46:50,130 --> 04:46:54,320
出嚟嘅一啲趨勢，嚟到去幫我哋做一個整體嘅評估。

1867
04:46:55,070 --> 04:47:06,990
原則上，政府過去有講過，今日想可以再重複，就係政府會喺物業市場供求回復平衡之後，係考慮適當地去調整有關嘅管理需求措施。

1868
04:47:07,300 --> 04:47:27,310
我過去喺法案委員會亦都承諾咗，今日亦都再作一次承諾，就係話會喺通過呢個條例草案後一年向立法會交代對相關措施嘅檢討。當然喺檢討嘅時候，我哋會同大家去分析政府點樣睇啊當時嘅嗰個誒內內部嘅經濟狀況、外圍嘅經濟狀況。所以我懇請。

1869
04:47:27,310 --> 04:47:33,550
議員咧係反對誒李議員代表法案委員會所動議嘅修正案。多謝各位。

1870
04:47:34,120 --> 04:47:40,960
現在我提出嘅待決議題係運輸及房屋局局長動議嘅第四項修正案，預議。

1871
04:47:42,070 --> 04:47:43,070
啊！

1872
04:47:43,680 --> 04:47:44,860
多人喺度裏邊。

1873
04:52:19,600 --> 04:52:20,940
啊，咩問題？

1874
04:52:21,500 --> 04:52:24,350
啱啱入嚟，而家呢個代決議題係。

1875
04:52:24,860 --> 04:52:31,980
呢個係局長動議嘅第四項修正案，係修正第十七。

1876
04:53:46,100 --> 04:53:47,040
拆佢啦！

1877
04:57:13,880 --> 04:57:14,520
嗯。

1878
04:57:18,970 --> 04:57:30,480
我哋在委提出嘅待決議題係運輸及房屋局局長動議嘅佢嘅第四項修正案，予以通過。現在付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

1879
04:57:31,220 --> 04:57:33,060
反對嘅請舉手。

1880
04:57:33,740 --> 04:57:35,030
我認為。

1881
04:57:35,940 --> 04:57:37,260
議題。

1882
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:45,820
獲得在席委員以過半數贊成，我宣佈修正案獲得通過。

1883
04:57:48,590 --> 04:58:04,140
誒，我哋同大家講咗咧話，我哋呢個會到兩點鐘到就要暫停，我相信我哋唔夠時間去處理下一行嘅了決啦，所以喺呢度我哋就暫停會議，會喺今天下午嘅八點正恢復。
