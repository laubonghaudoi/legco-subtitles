27
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,160
ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:55,010
The tentative recommendation on adverse possession were published in consultation in December of 2012.

29
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,560
We have attended the meeting of this panel in February of 2013.

30
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:12,420
And we have received over one hundred and ten organisations and individuals proposals or or comments on our views.

31
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,850
Now, in preparing the final report on the first session, we have reconsidered those recommendations.

32
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,770
Taking into account the views that we have gathered from the public,

33
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,310
and these are summarised in the report.

34
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:41,170
The report contains two new recommendations. That is, recommendation nine and ten. They are basically to deal with particular decisions of the CFA, because.

35
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,220
It is the final court of final appeal in Hong Kong. We feel that.

36
00:07:46,500 --> 00:08:06,510
If the law is to be changed by the court itself, it may take another number of years when a suitable case come up and when litigation has reached that level. And having regard to the fact that we feel that the decision is absolutely wrong, we feel that the better way to do it is by

37
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,840
way of legislation, and hence will make the recommendation.

38
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:18,060
Now the rules relating to acquisition of land through adverse possession are really contained in the limitation ordinance.

39
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:35,510
and also some case law, and basically the period of the limitation period in relation to land owned by the government is sixty years, for other private owned land is twelve years. That is the provision at the moment.

40
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:52,330
altogether we make ten recommendations on the topic. The first recommendation relates to the question whether there should be squatter title at all, and we come to the view that we should still have squatter title under the existing system.

41
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:04,870
And in fact, from the comments that we receive from the public, the majority are in favour of retaining squatter title or adverse possessory title.

42
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:19,180
There are of course organisations who are opposed to that, and in particular, I think the Hung Yi Kok is one of the leading organisation against any squatter title at all.

43
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:27,520
now the consultation responses from individuals, however, is quite different. The individuals actually

44
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:41,510
mostly feel that property owners should not actually lose their title to the property. That is counting in terms of numbers of of individuals who have expressed their view.

45
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,510
但係， regard to the fact that we have had

46
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,690
a long history of having squatted title, and also.

47
00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:05,320
squat title does help to solve certain of our existing problem, in particular in relations to land say in the new territory in particular, where the legal boundary

48
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,340
and the possessory boundary are often different.

49
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:22,470
所以它 serve some useful purpose at the moment. We feel that taking everything in the wrong, we should still retain the the the the law on adverse possession.

50
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,800
We also discuss, of course, the boundary problems in in in this respect.

51
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:52,090
And in practice, we find that very often the boundary problem are long rooted, and in many cases actually it springs back from the year of 1905 or thereabout, where there is a complete survey and done not by today's standard, not very professionally.

52
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,540
Of course, in those days, one couldn't really put much blame on on the matter.

53
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:05,340
And very often we found that adverse possession is really the only solution to some of the boundary problems.

54
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,980
那。

55
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,350
then we also considered。

56
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,700
第。

57
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:21,230
the law, what the law should be, when we have, when we have registered land title.

58
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,570
And we feel that the law would have to be completely revamped.

59
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,260
under a registered title system.

60
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:49,550
And in that regard, actually, by and large, we propose a system whereby, if and when we should have registered title, we will adopt the English system of requiring the adverse possessors to give notice and to to register owner.

61
00:11:49,550 --> 00:12:00,820
And give the register owner an opportunity to oppose the application by the adverse possessor for registration of his interest in the land.

62
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:21,110
bearing always in mind that under registered title, it is the land registry, the register that counts, and it is not really by the transfer or the deed that counts. So one ascertain ownership simply by going to the land registry and find out who is the.

63
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,660
Register owner and that is supposed to be conclusive.

64
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:32,750
所以，如果我們要有averse possession，咁當然，squatter就要自己註冊。

65
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:53,230
Now under the registered system, if we look at law in other jurisdiction, there are jurisdiction with register land whereby it did not permit any squatter title at all. That is because one must bear in mind that it is the register, which is the supreme.

66
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:06,360
which has got the supreme say as to who owns the land, and that is why. But we feel that by and large we can still, on top of that, have a a worse adverse possession on registered land.

67
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,790
and we prefer to adopt the English system, which we feel really.

68
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,240
誒。

69
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,280
really suck at the at the right balance.

70
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:39,570
Now we also recommend that there should be the abolition of the implied license theory, and the implied license theory is basically to say that in the 70s there were some decisions, particularly in England, and some of them were all also adopted in Hong Kong, whereby it is said that the squatters would not.

71
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:52,400
be able to get a squatter title if his use of the land is not inconsistent with the true with the owner's intention as to how the land should be made use of.

72
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,840
now that is a theory which is.

73
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:07,210
which would make adverse possession more difficult to get, of course. But on the other end, we feel that there is no justification for such theory. In England, the position has been.

74
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:25,480
put into the right trench by the limitation amendment act, and there are some case law which also says that that line of decision is wrong in any event, and therefore we feel that for the removal of doubt, we should really adopt the same approach in Hong Kong.

75
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,790
In relation to other recommendations.

76
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:46,200
We feel that our recommendation five and seven are generally supported, except Law Society and the香怡公，which did not agree with our recommendation. And for recommendation nine and ten.

77
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,290
我已經提到，那係因為特定 aspect of the of a decision of the Court of Final Appeal。

78
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:05,460
Now, so far as the boundary problem is concerned, we recommended that the government should be urged to step up its efforts to address the boundary problems in the new territories.

79
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:13,330
And but of course, a resurvey of all the land in the new territories has not been recommended by us.

80
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,080
bearing in mind the cost involved and it does not actually by itself solve all the problems.

81
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:39,860
now in relation to Joeland the land in Joel, and because of the of the law which says that if the land is held on trust, you cannot actually completed your adverse possession title unless you dispossess each and every beneficiaries.

82
00:15:40,140 --> 00:16:00,150
Now, if that be the case in the case of Joel and in the new territories, having regard to the fact that every male member born by that Joel would automatically becomes a beneficiary, in effect, there is that you cannot really have adverse possession against.

83
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:07,960
now it is an anomaly, but we feel that a the problem is not really that acute.

84
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:27,330
And secondly, we see no reason to disturb the long-established rule, which is enshrined in our limitation ordinance, which requires you to dispossess not just the legal title owner but all beneficiaries under any landholding trust.

85
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,110
So we really.

86
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:50,530
accept that this is an ancient kind of landholding institute in under Chinese law, and unless that institution of landholding is really got rid of by legislation, which is not part of our function, we prefer not to touch.

87
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,480
on this particular aspect.

88
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,710
嗯。

89
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:08,310
Well, I think basically that is a summary of our recommendation. Our recommendations number one to ten are in fact contained in our in our report.

90
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,960
And I don't think it is necessary for me to read it out all over again.

91
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:28,530
好，嗯，多謝陳景生主席。咁而家咧就係啊，請委員發言嘅。咁睇下有幾多位委員對啊，翼權管有呢一次嘅建議書有啊。

92
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,920
有意見。

93
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:53,120
係譚耀宗議員。誒，如果未有人問我啊，先問先係好。噉我就首先因為都而家暫時係譚耀宗議員啦，我自己都會發問啦。我暫時會寬鬆少少啦，嚇噉就係誒，我畀個都係五分鐘嘅誒誒指引先啦。但係我會寬。

94
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,850
鬆少少處理嘅係李慧瓊議員。

95
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,290
嚇！咁而家連埋我就係三位，咁首先請阿譚耀宗議員。

96
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:15,850
誒喺呢個業權管有呢個問題上，其實個都係有一定嘅爭議嘅。誒，因為有啲人擔心就自己喺唔知情嘅情況底下，噉啊畀人哋啊經咗一段時間之後，就畀人攞咗佢嗰個嗰個嗰個權利啊，嗰個業權。

97
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:36,320
咁而家咧，我見咧就誒做咗一啲調整，咁即係話將嗰個年份咧就縮短咗，即係從十二年去到十年。但係咧就要誒，即係你要誒支回嗰個業權人啊，即係喺十即係十年之後你要支回個業權人，然後誒你你先可以進行。

98
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:45,120
咁誒，但係有時咧，資助嘅業權人嗰度咧，即係用咩辦法嚟資助咧？有時都幾～

99
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:57,150
幾頭痛嘅一樣嘢，譬如如果你話登報紙噉，咁可能呢啲嘅業權人佢可能亦都唔會話每日睇曬所有嗰啲報紙嘅，咁所以就。

100
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:17,440
誒，佢可能嗰啲業權人，佢亦都誒未必察覺得到，或者你想通知佢咧，亦都唔容易去誒誒通知得到嗰啲人。咁所以我就想問下喺呢方面，法改會誒有冇啲諗過點樣嘅處理嘅辦法咧？噉樣好，陳主。

101
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:35,750
主席，阿阿譚議員，我首先要澄清一點嘅，要好重要就係喺現時嘅土地制度之下咧，我哋係冇建議到要畀呢個通知嘅。即係而家香港暫時，我哋所有嘅地啊，都係unregistered land。

102
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:56,050
即係話咧，我哋而家嗰個咧，唔係唔係有一個業權嘅註冊嘅。我哋呢個建議咧，係等將來我哋嗰個land title啊，land title ordinance，即係我哋嗰個土地嗰個啊業權嗰個注嗰個條例生效咗之後咧，我哋先正會。

103
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:16,060
實行，因為當嗰條條例生效咗之後咧，每一笪地喺填土廳度咧，都有一個註冊業主。嗰個註冊業主嗰度咧，當然有佢點樣。你任何如果你做咗註冊業主咧，我哋亦都即係合理地期望咧。如果你更改地址啊～

104
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:36,070
你咩嘢咧？你自己就應該去個註冊制度嚟講明啊！我陳某某，我係呢幾笪呢度以下物業嘅業主，而家我改咗地址啦。咁噉，所以咧將來嚟講咧，因為有一個噉嘅中央登記嘅制度咧，係可以好方便對揾到邊一個係業主嘅。

105
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:51,240
即係呢個只其一啦，因為而家嚟講咧，我哋係真係冇辦法嘅。而家你都有有時啲地點唔知去邊度嘅業主，因為你而家我哋所去前草廳登記咧，只不過係登記咗係一啲契約嘅登記。

106
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:11,530
嗰張契約真定假咧，其實咧，填土廳都唔保證嘅，即係你可以整張假契上佢登記咗，做好似登記業主都得嘅。而家因為噉嘅制度咧，將來嚟講咧，就當然要誒比較有一個比較嚴密啲嘅，容易揾得到邊個業主嗰個嗰個方法啦。

107
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:31,540
咁再且當然咧，我哋都明白到咁業主都會死嘅啫，登記業主都會死，死咗又未必有有人做承辦咁嗰啲。咁呢一啲噉嘅嘢嚟講咧，就冇辦法嘅啦。喺外國亦都要咁處理，即係佢假係要有一個機製出嚟，例如好似要登報或者獻報啊，或者。

108
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:51,550
你用某種嘅其他嘅形式，我哋係冇一個好誒，我哋冇一個好詳細嘅誒講出嚟應該點做，因為呢一個咧，我哋係有一個大方向嚟行。我相信咧，我哋好容易咧可以抄咗英國嗰個制度過嚟，因為英國嘅制度喺二零零。

109
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,930
二年咧，到而家都行咗十幾年啦。咁即係我哋可以根據佢嘅經驗嚟做嘢咯。

110
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:18,840
係譚議員。誒係誒，好多謝啊誒主席嗰個啊陳主席嗰個澄清。噉就誒不過嗰業權登記制度咧，嗰個法例已經誒定咗好耐，不過而家都仲未行得到。噉就所以可能如果要做埋呢個，前。

111
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:38,850
睇啦，噉就都係要要仲有好多功夫，甚至行到呢一步噉，所以可能法改會即係呢個建議，可能都都都仲有有排先行到呢條路啊。咁不過我我只係即係即係澄清咗，我都明白多咗。嗯，多謝好。咁跟住係阿李慧瓊議員。

112
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:48,940
係誒主席，亦都多謝誒法改會主席佢哋嘅誒介紹啦。其實益權。

113
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,430
誒佔有。

114
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,660
呢個業權管有呢個概念咧，對於好多法團嚟講咧，舊樓嘅業主嚟講咧，就～

115
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:17,240
佢都好難明白嘅。雖然我大家尊重法律啦，但係即係大家都明白有佢歷史嘅緣故嚇。即係如果大家有落區瞭解下咧，都可能同我經歷過同樣嘅誒個案，就係一啲天台啊，有啲誒。

116
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:37,530
後巷嘅公用地方，因為歷史緣故咧，就被一啲人佔咗。咁但係當年咧，即係講緊五六十年嘅樓位，四五十年嘅樓咧，初初咧就冇發團嘅，亦都冇話誒通知佢哋誒叫佢唔好用呢個地方。咁但係就因為有呢個業權管。

117
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:57,540
本有嘅案例，亦都因為係有十年或者十二年呢個要求咧，啲法團就好驚嘅。誒，噉佢哋都成日同我投訴議員噉樣，咪即係變相鼓勵啲人去霸佔其他人嘅地方，咁法律點會點點可能係係噉樣處理嘅咧？我唔知你喺呢個做呢個誒報。

118
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:11,790
報告書裏邊咧，有冇考慮到呢部分嘅意見嘅咧？如果有，你哋嘅考慮點係點咧？如果冇，誒，其實你哋又點去理解呢啲居民佢哋嗰個關注咧？可唔可以都喺度即係讓大家知識一下咧？好，陳主席。

119
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:31,040
誒，我哋係即係我其實我哋第一個第一個建議recommendation咧，就係究竟我哋需唔需要仲應唔應該繼續有業權嘅誒，業權啊侵佔嘅嘅嘅權力啊嗰啲嘢嘅。咁但係我哋諗過咧，就係第一咧就係。

120
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:39,650
如果你係法理學嚟講咧，而家我哋個土地擁有制度咧係basic possession嘅，係佔有嘅。

121
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:50,940
咁即係話，所以咧就係，如果你佔有笪地夠一個長嘅時期嘅時候咧，你就冇人能夠證明到佢嘅權。

122
00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:00,330
係畀你嘅權大嘅話咧，噉你就係呢個土地擁有者，呢個就係英國法律對土地嘅基本睇法嚟嘅。

123
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:08,620
咁所以咧喺英國嗰度咧，就已經有亦全擁有呢一樣嘢咧，亦都有咗相當耐嘅時候。

124
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:26,270
咁但係咧喺香港嚟講咧，我哋亦都有呢條條例咧，亦都有咗好多十年，一九三五年到咧都應該有嘅啦。之前亦都有，咁所以嚟講咧，你話突然間取消咗佢嘅時候咧，亦都有好多方便之處嘅。

125
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:40,380
咁當然咧，有好多時咧，我哋都要睇睇就係，例如喺新界嘅土地人士咧，有好多人咧，佢自己佢住緊間屋咧，有半間屋咧，其實係歪咗嘅。

126
00:25:40,660 --> 00:26:00,670
咁如果你冇咗呢個役權啊，佢唔可以繼續擁有嘅時候，噉佢係咪有人可以走嚟？佢就話餵你畀翻半間屋我咧噉。咁所以呢一個問題嚟講咧，我明白到啊，我哋都知道咧，有好多人亦都好有理由地講就係我明明係業主，點解入？

127
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,440
有人可以攞咗我啲嘢去嘅咧，噉。

128
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:23,730
咁誒，而且咧個年份嚟講咧，係我哋睇翻個legal policy嚟講啊。以前最先咧係二十年嘅，係啊最近呢二十年到先正改咗作十二年。咁所以嚟講咧，如果我哋而家霎時間話喂唔應該唔應該係十二年十二年太容。

129
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:36,430
同意啦，應該完全冇之後咧，又似乎咧就睇下我哋嗰個法律啊，嗰個行走嗰條路線咧，就似乎係倒倒退咗添。咁所以有好多方面咧，我哋都有考慮過呢個問題。

130
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:57,380
啊，主席，李議員，即係呢個我諗，可能新界同市區都係有不同嘅情況啦。即係如果喺市區舊樓咧，你講嗰個倒退，可能喺佢嚟講有十二十年變翻十二年咧，就真係個倒退，因為但係呢個倒退咗好耐㗎啦嘛。係我明白，我明白。咁而家十二年又變翻十年，就另一個倒退添。

131
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:17,390
因為你點樣去處理佢嘅一個一個一個講法啦？話佢唔啱嘅，佢哋唔係法律專家，就係話喂，係咪呢個域權侵佔係鼓勵啲人去霸地咧？噉係咪咁？你佢係佢係真金白銀去買嗰個地方係佢公用地方，只不過以前大夏法團係。

132
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:37,400
冇成立，亦都佢哋個人個別業主冇辦法去管理到呢啲公用地方。咁但係因為有呢個業權侵佔咧，佢哋就好驚啦嚇，無端端咧冇咗塊地噉。噉你點樣去回應佢呢個關注點咧？我都我我都解唔通噉啊，所以請你嚟幫手回應下，陳主席或者其他幾位。

133
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,300
或者我可以誒誒幫啊主席代答呢一部分啦。

134
00:27:41,580 --> 00:28:01,590
佢最主要嘅問題咧，唔怕我哋話稍為寬鬆少少，因為最主要嘅問題就係咧，從嗰個現時嘅土地嘅業權擁有嘅制度之下咧，根本咧，如果一個業主話我嘅我係業主，就因為譬如話有個官批，有個個誒。

135
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,920
啊！

136
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:22,210
Crown lease噉我就係個業主咧。其實呢個個個理解有少少錯誤嘅，因為從嗰個普通法嘅角度嚟睇咧，係嗰個possession係佔有嗰個地咧，你就係業主嘅。嗰個官批咧批咗畀你咧，只不過係你嗰個業權嘅淵源係。

137
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:42,220
由來係點嚟？你而家最大嘅問題就係咧，一日我哋未曾有一個土地嘅業權登記嘅制度之下咧，根本上係冇辦法冇咗adverse possession呢個概念咧。呢個係最大。呢個呢個概念真係好難，讓讓短時間讓讓啲市民明白啊！或者要再嚟。

138
00:28:42,220 --> 00:29:02,230
解下我排第二輪啦，主持。好啊，得誒，或者我自己都可以跟進一下問題嗱。首先咧，呢個役權管有嘅概念，我哋可能啊喺香港讀法律嘅咧好多，即係考試都有一定考，大家都熟。但係對於普通嘅市民嚟講咧，其實一個幾深嘅一個概念，同埋即係好似啊李議員其實即係我哋都好經常與。

139
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:22,240
遇到同樣嘅問題，佢哋有啲覺得不可思議嘅嗱。我首先講下，譬如附近嘅管轄區咁先啦嚇。香港好多人咧，咪幾廿年之後翻返去內地就要追翻啲幾廿年前嗰啲祖屋啦，係嘛？就畀人佔咗幾廿年啦咁咁咧。但係咧，即係誒誒，大家會覺得啊，如果係非法佔有嘅噉，就應該係誒我第日有翻。

140
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:42,250
追索翻，我係繼承人，我就應該可以追翻。但係喺香港咧，即係大家睇到咧嗰個法律嘅處理係唔同，咁以致到咧就係話誒嗱，我哋都遇過有唔少嘅個案，我哋想你哋可以再有機會再研究一下，譬如有啲長者婆婆公公咧，佢哋係真係。

141
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,130
係畀佢啲朋友使用。

142
00:29:44,410 --> 00:30:04,420
嗱，使用咗之後，佢係即係咩都冇嘅，或者佢又租啊又信啊噉樣擺咗去，咁其實帶有蒙騙嘅成分咁啦嚇。咁過咗一大段時間，人哋嗰啲一係租霸或者職業嘅，佢又用呢一個咧，佢有機會可以係誒根據役權管有咧，就調轉咗嗰個所有權嘅喎。咁咧又另外咧就係話。

143
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:24,430
話誒喺誒所謂通知嗰度，頭先阿譚議員有提過啦，就係即係我哋其實係比較難去通知到。當然我係支持嘅加通知呢樣嘢咧，呢個方向我一定係支持嘅。只不過咧，就係喺誒嗰個我哋認為對某啲人咧，可能係惡夢。

144
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:44,440
嚟嘅喺香港嚇，譬如你頭先講係走道，有啲咧其實佢可能係出門口嗰度噉，而家都有啦，有啲個案係嘛，佢做咗餐廳或者其他嗰啲業主係唔知嘅，佢理所當然佢認為佢有呢個權利。噉我諗咧，如果話繼續我哋係喺呢個方向咧，其實對於公眾嘅教育，第一都。

145
00:30:44,440 --> 00:31:01,650
都好重要，嗰啲人做咗業主咧，去大安置業，佢唔會噉樣畀人非法佔領咧，就會冇咗嘅。呢個係好緊要嘅，對有啲人嚟講。第二咧，我我想問下陳主席咧，即係話嗱，鄉議局我哋好清楚啦，點解佢係唔同意啦？啊，律師會又因為咩唔同意啊？

146
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:22,500
誒，佢保留咗佢嗰個意見。律師會咧就係佢同我哋最大嘅分歧咧。律師會以為咧喺現時我哋嘅土地制度之下咧，都應該可以實行我哋個新建議，即係就係話咧，你唔可以有業權、業權擁有。

147
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:32,700
如果你冇畀到個通知畀個業主，嗱呢樣嘢咧聽落咧就好似好好，但係實質行起上咧就有幾個大困難嘅。

148
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:53,060
第一個咧就係話你係幾時啊？先正可以即係你你畀邊個嗱？你畀首先你畀通知畀個業主，邊個係業主咧？咁因為而家嚟講咧係冇一個最權威嘅方式去揾到邊嘅業主，你畀邊一個業主？

149
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,440
嗯。

150
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:06,690
第二個咧就都仲有嘅問題咧，就係話，如果你話十年之後你可以畀，噉你係擁有咗，如果係超過十二點咧，係幾時開始咧？

151
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:14,210
因為而家係position base嘅時候咧，我哋咧就有呢個噉嘅誒概念上嘅困難嘅。

152
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:34,500
咁所以我哋就覺得咧，與其係而家有一套話，如果我哋而家實行一套制度，又明知咧遲早咧香港都有咧即set title嘅時候，噉我哋點解要做一啲咁咁麻麻煩嘅嘢啊？因為土地改革咧就唔係話一招一直嘅事。

153
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:54,510
嘢嘅，我哋係要睇長遠嘅。例如好似你就算啊，上一次將嗰個疫權佔有嘅時間由二十年改到係十二年咧，都係有有一個好長嘅誒transitional period可以去有一個過渡期嘅。咁所以我就覺得咧，就係既然我

154
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:05,970
我哋已經有咗個land title order嚟洗套啦，將來啊始終都會實行啦，因為嗰個法例已經過咗，咁始終實行嘅時候，我哋而家又點會等一套？

155
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:26,260
噉嘅制度喺度去實行一個時間又唔知幾長嘅時間喺呢個概念上亦有問題嘅，所以我哋唔主張喺而家嘅現時制度之下等嗰個誒畀通知嗰個噉嘅廣泛落去。再且嚟講就係誒，例如。

156
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,770
好似到而家有人已經霸咗，例如佢十年或者霸咗八年，咁嗰啲情形點咧？

157
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:53,110
如果而家霸咗十一年嘅，噉佢係咪即刻要畀咧？咁即係好好多方面咧。我哋覺得就係，如果係有一個新嘅制度咧，就不如等我哋有一個新嘅土地擁有嘅制度有一個新改變，重新嚟過一個新業。係而家咧，我哋就係唔好改，因為點解越改咧？

158
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,260
就越煩嘅。

159
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:05,770
越煩嘅時候咧，就係當然喺律師嚟講就梗係梗梗好嘅。你越多啲噉嘅嘢，越多官司打越好。咁但於市民嚟講，未必係好㗎嘛。

160
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,150
係，就係咧。

161
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:28,570
而家點解我哋話嗰個建議話第二日要畀通知咧，就要等佢嗰個有業權登記條例先嘅。點解咧？因為第二日咧，你係登記咗嗰個register owner就係業主，但係而家咧，你好多時你睇契咧，你都唔知道邊個係業主嘅。咁其實咧，亦

162
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:35,570
權擁有、佔有呢樣嘢咧，係有一個好有用嘅做嘢，就係從一個誒。

163
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:51,800
轉售物業個過程之中，好多時咧，我哋做律師咧都會發現有好多好多業權咧係冇辦法醫嘅，即係啲契咧係有啲technical defect，你係醫唔到嘅。唯一咧，你就係坐夠十二年。

164
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:04,110
夠鐘咧，咁個業權就靠業業權業權擁有嗰樣嘢嚟填補嗰啲罅隙嘅。如果你有通知嗰樣嘢咧，你基本上就係。

165
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:13,890
廢咗呢一個啊，逆權擁有愛嚟保鑊嗰個嗰個方式㗎啦嚇。嗯，誒第二輪係啊。

166
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:34,610
係好咁咧。而家有第一輪嘅誒，郭榮亨議員，跟住第二輪仲有兩位嚇誒，跟住吳亮星議員。好，郭榮亨議員，誒多謝主席。首先咧，我誒想係多謝啊法律改革委員會嘅成員咧，係花咗咁多時間同心機去研究。

167
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:54,620
有呢個問題，而我知道成員咧，其實係都係即係一個pro bono噉樣嘅嘅形式去幫手噉，所以其實都真係花唔少時間同埋精神去研究一啲咁複雜嘅法律問題。咁其實我哋睇過我自己睇過嗰個啊建議嘅內容咧，其實具。

168
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:14,630
睇嚟講，我都係同意嘅，因為確實而家香港嘅情況咧，唔係我哋從白紙開始，我哋係已經有一套行咗好耐嘅一個啊一個啊土地法律。咁如果你突然間話要改，逆權侵佔，因為你覺得逆權要侵佔喺某啲情況之下唔公平咧，其實。

169
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:34,640
其實佢變相亦都衍生咗好多其他好複雜嘅法律問題出嚟嘅，咁呢個大原則係噉樣。第二咧就係其實啊，主席，我哋都應該問一問究竟局方咧，究竟其實佢喺嗰個土地註冊嗰個新嘅條例，究竟佢係諗住幾時實施啊，同埋嗰個進度係點樣啊，主席。

170
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,350
我哋係咪依個委員會咧？其實都應該。

171
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,460
誒去研究下呢個問題，同埋叫局方嚟去作一個具體嘅回應，因為呢個。

172
00:36:43,820 --> 00:37:02,650
啊！真係過咗個法例咁多年啦，仲未實施，噉我都唔需要講嗰個歷史啦，大家都好清楚啦。咁所以主席，我都有個提議，就係睇下局方究竟而家打算係點樣，我都想知道。好啊，我哋可以傾下。誒，首先請阿陳主席誒。

173
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,900
頭先話即係你哋。

174
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,580
估計嗰個係會等幾耐啊！

175
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:28,870
我我哋我哋唔唔唔到我哋話事嘅呢樣嘢，我哋都絕對冇影響力嘅。係因為我哋我哋個term of reference咧係唔唔唔處理到嗰個land title嘅問題嘅。嗯，所以呢方面咧，我哋只有配合。我哋知道有條噉嘅條例，我哋知道條條例過咗，我。

176
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:48,880
我哋知道條條例未生效，所以我哋嗰個我哋嗰個心存一定嘅就係話呢條條例遲早會生效，所以所以我哋先作出呢個相應嘅建議。好啊，不如我建議我哋委員會咧寫封信去問下大家而家諗住即係嚇點樣處理噉，我哋咧都。

177
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:58,070
我覺得呢個係值得討論嘅嚇，既然我哋討論疫權管又討論咗即即幾次嘅啦，其實係嘛都做到呢個階段，咁咧嗱誒。

178
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:24,750
嗰陣時咧係係攞上嚟通過嗰陣時，我哋都係提咗好多以往嘅marketing咧喺度畀咗好多好多意見。嗰陣時政府都係要咁去做咧，依個唔係封信叫佢加快，叫佢點去改翻好佢，即係你要加快。主席即係你講，即係你你要你我喺度。

179
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:42,480
講翻個歷史畀你聽，主席。嗱，陳議員，嗱，因為噉，誒，我必須咧有吳亮星議員排緊隊。嗱，我哋我真係吳亮星議員問完之後咧，我就誒誒suppose你會係發言，好冇？畀五分鐘你嚇，唔緊要，你補充，因為你係好有經驗喺呢一方面。吳亮星議員。

180
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,920
多謝主席。

181
00:38:44,200 --> 00:39:04,210
誒就似呢一點咧，即係因為頭先我聽咗幾位誒，即係對呢個役權擁誒管有呢個噉嘅，即係嗰個基本嘅定義咧，的確喺我哋上次討論呢個香港嘅資產管理嘅時候都有個誒類似嘅情況，咁誒。

182
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:20,050
即係呢個係可能儒家思想咧，就係路不拾遺嘅，誒唔係自己嘅唔好攞啦噉樣。但係問題就西方發展嘅過程咧，我哋呢度咧亦都要承認呢個歷史嘅發展。噉啊，所以。

183
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:40,340
情理法都都涉及嘅，就係依一個役權擁有嘅話，噉我同意咧，就係話如果要處理好一啲資產嚇，即係你擺咗件嘢喺度，大家都唔用呢個，即係呢個肯肯定係即係所謂暴殄天天物嘅問題。咁但係如果要擁有就，

184
00:39:40,360 --> 00:40:00,370
誒，如果有咗條款法例嘅時候咧，擁有咗先咧，咁嗰個手段就係一個問題嚟嘅。噉啊，所以我就想了解一下咧，有冇研究過喺擁喺管有嘅時候咧，係用乜嘢方便去佔領佢或者佔有佢咧？嗱，呢一個如果係喺歷史上可以查。

185
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:20,380
得翻，譬如話佢係十幾年啫，但係十幾年之中，佢會係有人或者有人證、有物證去證明到咧，喺管有嘅時候，嗰個取得嘅手段係有某啲情情況係誒有問題嘅。我唔好講佢有冇犯法先，噉你。

186
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:28,000
時候呢一個喺到時，即係所謂喺正式登記或者等等嘅時候，會有啲乜嘢嘅誒？

187
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:48,310
爭論或者誒另外嗰啲糾紛出現咧咁嗱，呢點有冇喺你哋研究呢個時候誒？第日喺正式登記處理嘅時候會有啲乜嘢嘅做法？我想先問一個。好啊，陳主席。嗱誒喺現時嗰個法律制度之下咧，就。

188
00:40:48,310 --> 00:41:04,450
總之，你係有業業權侵佔咗嘅時候咧，噉就係就係業權侵佔，即係話你未得到嗰個業主個同意，你佔用咗個地方，咁呢個咧就已經係構成業權侵佔嘅。

189
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:24,740
咁亦都咧，當然咧，你係唔可以，你係要諗住就係話，你係要佔用咗呢個地方，你要有噉嘅意意圖。咁喺呢一方面嚟講咧，誒，如果例如佢係行騙，或者佢呃，如果佢原原先佢係得到業主嘅同意嘅，業主話嗱。

190
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,180
得啦，你一路喺度住啦，就誒。

191
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:39,690
直至到咧，我通知你走，噉你就走啦。咁噉嘅時候咧，其實就唔係業權，唔係業權侵佔嘅。不過當然咧，我亦都明白到咧，係。

192
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:58,930
法律就一個問題，舉證又另外一個問題，因為通常譯權侵佔呢啲案件咧係發生嘅時間咧，起碼都十幾年前啦。咁所以咧舉證個方面咧，往往係有困難嘅。但呢一樣嘢咧係唔影響到啊嗰個法律應該係點嘅。

193
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:19,220
因為咧，除咗土地之外咧，我哋嗰個limitation of time時限法例咧，亦都有其他嘅，例如好似你係合約嘅，一般嚟講係六年。如果你六年都唔告嘅話咧，你就係已經係唔可以再告㗎啦。咁即係例如呢呢樣嘢咧，唔係淨係土地嘅。咁所以我我。

194
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:26,130
我嘅睇法咧就係誒，逆權侵佔呢個概念咧，亦都而家已經幾幾establish嘅啦。

195
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,630
咁所以咧，我哋都冇需要喺作作出有任何嘅修改。

196
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:39,710
將來有咗土地註冊嘅嗰個註冊嗰個誒業權註冊嘅時候會係點咧？咁咁當然啦。

197
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:55,760
政府如果佢係畀一啲人註冊做某一個物業嘅業主之前咧，我相信政府亦都要經過一個嚴謹嘅審核嘅。咁所以咧，可可以咧就應該喺嗰個land title嗰度咧。

198
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:16,050
要預先咧有做做咗一個嚴謹嘅審核，就邊一個先至有資格去做呢個業主？咁喺呢一方面嚟講咧，就係誒當然係喺註冊嘅時候咧就把關啦。噉啊，想問問，如果喺把關嘅時候，即係係咪有一個比較完整嘅上訴或者？

199
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:36,060
嘅推翻嘅機制喺度咧，我嗱呢個就其實唔係我哋個職權範圍嘅，呢個係registered title入邊嗰個職權範圍。但係我即係我自己作為一個律師嚟講咧，我覺得一定要有啦，唔通咪係人都對張紙上話啊？我係我我我係會封銀行嗰笪地個個業。

200
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,760
主噉，又梗係唔掂嘅。

201
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:59,060
好啊！我仲問問咧，就關於新界即係誒主要建議第六項嗰度咧，咁咧就新界土地嘅重新劃嗰個新劃嘅部分咧，誒會會出現一啲仍然係所謂由專業人、專業人士、專業機構去做㗎啦。咁但係依度裏邊去。

202
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:19,070
佢提到咧就話，可能有啲誒唔會接受嘅。若然唔接受嘅時候咧，就等最好就等到呢個土地業權條例實施過程嘅一並解決。噉就係呢個諗法係咪到時將呢啲本來行政上或者一啲一般性嘅糾紛咧，變成喺法庭裏邊去透過呢？

203
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:39,080
一條條例去解決係咪有呢噉嘅諗法咧？係陳主席，我我嗱呢個又係僆差同嗰方面嘅問題嚟嘅。噉我相信咧誒，唔係一定要法庭嘅。如果係一個好大嘅好大個註冊嘅問題咧，可能有一啲特別嘅審裁處，又會有一個特別嘅特別嘅情。

204
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:59,090
再去處理都未定，但呢一方面唔係我哋呢個疫疫權啊方面嘅職責範圍嚟嘅。係好噉，因為排第二輪嘅咧就啊，剩翻我係排隊噉啊，我問埋第二輪咧，我哋就睇下點樣跟進，好冇啊？係阿謝偉俊議員，畀你。

205
00:44:59,090 --> 00:44:59,500
係。

206
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:20,030
誒，多謝主席，主席啊，唔好意思，我舉手慢咗嚇。誒，幾點啫？我留意咗咧，就一就係有關嗰個土地業權條例咧。大家都知道，零四年已經通過咗㗎啦，而家已經十週年紀念㗎啦。咁晾咗喺度咁多年咧，究竟點做咧？咁剛才都同事表達咗對，包括郭榮鏗議員，包括石禮謙議員咧，就呢個。

207
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:40,040
噉嘅情況咧，就表達咗關注啦。噉我都同意咧，我哋應該馬上咧就唔係一封信咁簡單，而係即時啊，真係要了解下究竟發生咩事幹。咁而見基於特別法會今次咧，亦都係誒有關第二同第三項嘅建議，都係見基於將來有業權誒土地業權條例通過之後，先至會誒有用嘅嗰兩個建。

208
00:45:40,040 --> 00:46:00,050
建議下噉。呢第一點，我想都補充翻，即係我嘅意見，就呢一樣嘢咧。誒，或者我想問一問兩點，一就係話嗰個我哋理解到，法改會咧，零二零零六年就已經係誒被委任誒處理呢個法呢個法改嘅問題，但係到而家今時今日先至係有嘅結果，當中個過程咧。

209
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:20,060
當然係起承轉合啦，亦都大家當然各場各編委員講咗好多謝大家努力啦，係無即係無上努力。但係你睇下點解個過程會真係咁耐咧？當中有啲乜嘢政府或者係誒喺處理呢方面係屬於係拖延啦、不足啦，定還是貴會咧係喺工作上出現咗啲困難，令到你哋係需要咁攞時間先有呢個結論咧？呢個第一點。

210
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,220
第二點咧，我想理解下就係。

211
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:42,610
就有關立法會嘅要求或者建議咧，係第四、第七、第九、第十咧，都分別係就有關於誒喺我哋嘅嗰個誒事限條例裏邊咧，做一啲修訂嘅。咁呢一方面，政府當局咧，而家目前為止佢哋嘅立場係點樣？就呢啲建議咧，有冇一個取態咧？誒，政府今日我相信律政司冇代表喺。

212
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,230
做啦，但係會唔會係有人可以瞭解到呢個方面嘅答案？可以講一講咧？

213
00:46:47,510 --> 00:47:05,120
好，陳主席傾咗八年。第一個咧就係誒，我哋慢就對不起啦，就就係其實咧就我哋工作咧係可能就冷散咗啲，咁因為我哋亦亦都唔係話即係有一個好長嘅，即係我哋我哋唔係話誒。

214
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:14,730
有一個好discipline嘅timetable啦，咁當然啊，我哋都要做consultation啦，出邊嘢亦都要問啦，咁噉啊。

215
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,990
呃。

216
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:36,520
第二樣嘢咧，就當然呢一樣嘢咧，其實啊，我哋喺淨係研究呢樣嘢嘅時候，我哋亦都要睇歷史嘅成因啊，各方面嘅嘢。咁所以咧，雖然我哋都係法律工作者，但係咧，法律工作者又一件事，研究個法律嘅根源咧，又另外一回事。咁所，

217
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,090
所以我就係花咗一啲時候喺嗰度嘅。

218
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:52,250
咁當然我哋中間亦都有人事嘅改變啦，你你都都睇到就係我哋有人 resign，亦都有人加入，咁所以嚟講咧就重複咁討論咗咧，就係嘥咗啲時候嘅。

219
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:59,580
咁所以咧，就我哋即係我哋自己都係嘥咗若干年啊，先正有呢個報告出嚟。

220
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,920
噉啊，我。

221
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:22,330
我哋係冇咩話特別嘅困難，亦都冇話有咩特別嘅團體畀我啲壓力。噉我亦都亦亦都其實除咗呢樣嘢，我亦都諗過有好多其他肢節嘅問題。例如好似我哋都考慮過啊喺聽證時嗰嗰嗰啲誒應該點講？

222
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,240
啊。

223
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:43,850
有啲相關嘅問題啦，例如好似我哋最近嗰個嗰個第十項建議嗰個條例，係源於咧就係嗰個役權擁有人啊，究竟佢係咪要將自己得啊，還是佢得嘅嗰個fruit就係畀咗佢嘅業主咧？咁咁呢一啲問題咧，我哋。

224
00:48:43,850 --> 00:49:03,860
都即係都研究過，咁但係我哋最後就發覺咧，呢個問題咧，我哋第一問題唔大，第二咧就我哋覺得亦都即係唔唔需要話特別作出一個一個嘅建議噉。咁所以咧，唔係話我哋嘅討論問題唔係話凈係呢本嘢入邊嘅，有啲相關嘅嘢我哋。

225
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:11,840
考慮過之後，就覺得即係都唔應該係誒踩只腳落去噉，咁所以我哋亦都冇講出嚟。

226
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:18,950
噉你至於你第二個問題咧，誒，我係冇咩特別嘢可以補充到嘅。

227
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,930
主席，今日司法。

228
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:34,450
誒應該就冇冇同事喺度代表係嘛？誒喺呢個冇啊！嗱，點解我哋唔揾埋最先一早嗰時？我明我唔明點解我哋今次呢個檢討誒？我諗咧就係係咪啊？

229
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:45,910
安信華女士，You represent the DOJ，Yeah. Could I just supplement in relation to the report being taken forward?

230
00:49:46,210 --> 00:50:01,570
That in fact the development bureau has advised that, in consultation with the lands department and the lands registry, it is now studying the recommendations from the LRC. Can you speak louder? I'm sorry.

231
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,130
yeah it's okay you.

232
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:15,390
Okay, the the development bureau has advised that it is studying in consultation with the lands department and the lands registry.

233
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,480
The recommendations of the LRC.

234
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,150
嗯。

235
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:41,440
噉樣啦，我諗誒，如果有時間，我用喺我幾多少少意見下好嘛，冇事誒。我建基於剛才啊，陳主席介紹關於你哋個立場，關於誒，如果有一個土地業權條例之後咧，你哋都建議係有個誒註冊嘅制度咧，能夠更加清楚喺呢一方面咧。咁但係亦都理解到律師會咧，佢哋。

236
00:50:41,440 --> 00:51:01,450
亦都喺呢一方面咧，就由由於而家未有或者有冇呢個土地業權條例生效，開始咧，佢哋有啲唔同嘅意見同個立場。咁其實呢一方面咧，喺關於個通知方面咧，當然我明白到個困難就係，當你如果連嗰個業主本身喺邊度、係邊個都唔知嘅時候，一定困難。但係見機，我哋而家呢個土地業權條例都唔知幾時先至會。

237
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:21,460
有機會生效嘅話咧，喺中段時間，我明白到有啲可能，剛才阿欣大律師都講咗話，可能對於一啲排咗隊嗰啲人，會唔會依或者嗰期嗰啲會唔會唔公道咧？咁噉，但係有一個有一個所謂trade-off，有個中段嘅比較臨時性嘅做法，係咪應該要要求？如果要畀通知嘅話咧，係唔唔係淨係賣報？

238
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:41,470
紙唔知點賣法，我哋冇冇時間成日check住報紙嘅，而係有一個類似好似即係破產嘅通知啊，或者破產註冊嗰類噉嘅制度係臨時性嘅，一唔緊要，但係要中央統籌咗所有啲通知，就係就任何業主如果想check下自己個地有冇煙人侵佔緊或者準備侵佔過咧，都可以馬上查到。咁呢個噉嘅。

239
00:51:41,470 --> 00:52:01,480
做法係咪一個咖啡溝，所以大家可以理解到，幫助大家唔好喺呢方面咁多喺喺黑喺空氣中、喺黑暗中摸黑嚟互相對抗咧，而可以比較公道啲、透明啲。大家知道究竟有啲咩例危險性嚟緊，有啲咩應該做而唔做咧，就可能會有風險發生嘅。又或者，如果任何人咧，即即使未有呢個土地權條例生效之前，

240
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,870
都有一定嘅透明度，一定嘅保障啦。陳主席。

241
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:06,340
嗯。

242
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:26,960
即係，如果大家以為係呢個實要係需要實行嘅咧，我相信亦都唔係話一定做唔到。但係建基於個，如果你話一定要畀咗通知之後咧，喺現時嘅制度之下咧，除起咗個業主係失咗蹤，或者個業主死亡冇人攞成辦，如果唔係嘅話，

243
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:40,750
話咧，其實咧就等於廢咗攞到役權侵佔呢一個噉嘅概念嘅，因為冇一個業主會畀人話：，嗱，你呢笪地啊，我要攞你嘅時候咧，個業主係唔採取任何嘅行動嘅。

244
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:57,710
咁所以喺呢一方面嚟講咧，我哋亦都平衡過。當然咧，係有啲有一好好多人嘅建議，就係話業權我哋要保要要保障，亦都好多人個建議就係話喂，但係我哋亦都唔應該咧係。

245
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:18,000
有一個，我哋唔應該係令人咧就話啊，你可以永遠都係霸住嗰笪地又唔用啊噉。同埋實質土地使用者啊，佢一路使用咗個笪地，亦都可能咧喺個笪地嗰度咧係做咗些少嘅發展，係例如好似佢起咗樓啊，佢喺度住噉。咁喺呢一方面嚟講咧。

246
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:38,010
我我哋都要平衡翻，就係話嗰個逆權擁有、逆權佔有咗個笪地用使用緊個人啦。噉佢嗰個利益就係點樣咧？佢亦都可能誒花咗一啲時間、一啲心思落去。咁所所以呢一方面嚟講咧，我哋係要兩方面都要平衡嘅。

247
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:53,620
咁仲有咧，就係因為我亦都一再重複，就係我哋已經有咗逆權擁有呢一個噉嘅概念咁多十年，咁突然間話冇咗，咁呢一方面嚟講咧，亦都係需要啊一啲嘅一啲嘅justification嘅。

248
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:02,060
係，即係我用一個，我諗我哋時間，我哋誒都聽到嘅。其實你嘅，唔係我我想補充一好快一點啫。

249
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:22,350
就係話，因為我哋而家都係最主要係個時限條例裏邊，其實個權冇冇喺冇extinguish數，只不過因為係個時限條例阻止咗佢起訴嘅權利咁解啫嚇。真正個權一係其實係冇係冇冇話，因為嗰個法律本身係冇咗嘅。唔係啊，section seventeen啊，係誒第section seventeen就係extinguish咗佢。我我知，但係即係變咗佢。

250
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:42,360
佢咧，我我意思就想講咧，就係噉樣，因為我哋而家嘅潮流咧，都越嚟越咧喺權益上咧，都盡可能透明度高嘅，無論係民事刑事都係。咁但係呢一方面，導致我哋咧就容易保留翻一個比較喺黑暗中摸黑作戰嘅一個噉嘅一個噉嘅做法，似乎真係不合時流嘅。咁呢方面都對，即係個平衡嚟講，對某啲人係好唔公。

251
00:54:42,360 --> 00:55:02,370
度噉，我覺得係呢個需要係再檢討下嘅。不過，我呢個係我自己意見啫。好，誒，我其實又排咗第二輪啦，又順便都做埋個即係我哋睇下點樣處理呢個問題。誒，即係我想都同陳主席講咧，其實即係我諗有役權管有嗰陣時嘅，即係最早嘅理念都係唔想嗰啲土地荒廢啊。誒，頭先你都提到啦，有。

252
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:22,380
啲可能喺上邊仲發展咗一啲嘢啊，噉樣咁呢個咧係一個合理去對待嗰個土地嘅發展嘅。但係咧，我覺得誒，我哋嘅委員問今日嘅問嘅題有好多咧，其實係好好嘅，包括就係話你點樣取得嗰個手段，你點樣取得嗰個土地嘅手段，如果動機係咩，當日嘅意圖係乜嘢，冇冇含含糊糊定？

253
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:42,390
點樣樣咧？其實佢會令到咧，即係因為我哋咧，可能喺民間接觸好多咧，即係有啲業主佢真係老㗎啦。其實通常出現喺啲老嘅業主先會出現呢啲問題，蒙查查噉。原來嗰個咧就畀人逆權管有咗，又唔識點處理。咁所以喺即係話處理呢個逆權管有嗰方面，既然我哋而家話考慮點？

254
00:55:42,390 --> 00:56:02,400
點樣改善？能唔能夠都真係加翻啲要素、元素考慮落去，即係包括咧，就係誒佢當日真係點樣取得呢個土地嘅誒？包括咧，你通知嘅時候，的確係嘅。如果嗰個人佢本身長者，佢可能就係得嗰個細嘅單位或者點樣嚇，佢畀人佔咗，或得個小嗰啲地噉，佢。

255
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:22,410
佢繼承人，佢合法繼承人，咁其實佢係應該有有嗰個權利係被通知，即係話啊呢個地原來我上祖輩係誒好辛苦，佢先至誒誒擁有到，咁而家就哇就冇咗嘅原來噉。譬如呢啲其實都係合理嘅，你知尤其是喺中國人呢一方面咧，其實。

256
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:42,420
嗰個即係我覺得可以考慮多少少元素，就誒而家好多時咧，即係所謂佢哋形容話摸黑咧，其實就咪即係一齣現咗之後先知，一打完官司話冇咗啦，咁先至知，即係好似李慧瓊議員講嗰啲，即係法團突然間就企曬喺度，我哋成日都睇到呢啲求助個案，有時亦都好難去幫佢噉。

257
00:56:42,420 --> 00:57:02,430
如果我哋講改善，會唔會諗多啲元素？因為誒，你非法佔有好啦，但係真係我哋見過有啲咧蒙查查，佢係畀人住住咗之後，因為十幾年啦，大家冇證冇據噉，又又攞咗又申請非法佔有，又會嘅。咁呢啲大家點樣可以令佢釐清咧？咁咁最後咧就係話你都講，你話唔知幾耐。

258
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:22,440
耐，因為個條例唔知幾耐喎，咁咁真係好耐嘅可以，咁所以如果我哋覺得通知呢個咧，其實都係一個好嘅，即係即係出路嚟嘅，對於比較平衡大家嗰個誒方式，所以誒係咪真係等個條例生效咧？即係我覺得律師會嘅意見，我哋都希望委員會。

259
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:42,450
或者都可以參考誒，但係咧，而家我哋處理委員會對呢件事咧，頭先誒柴禮謙議員又走咗啦，本來想畀佢講，噉佢就提到咧嗰個條例，佢認為起碼佢我諗佢係好清楚，即係參與得好多嘅，就好多嘅漏洞，咁咧就唔係立亂話叫佢生效，而係應該要睇翻即係。

260
00:57:42,450 --> 00:58:02,460
當日喺十年前，即係嗰個漏洞係點噉，不如咁啦，即係我都接受咧。大家即係你就咁寫封信咧，即係唔係好咩？既然大家真係有興趣呢個問題，我哋不如都問下究竟，即係而家誒誒提供一節嘅機會喺呢一度作出討論，跟進下嗰條條例，亦都。

261
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:22,470
請政府嘅代表、律政司嘅代表又上嚟，大家相關嘅誒解釋一下，究竟你係話諗住大修改正就咁劈咗喺度咧？噉你而家呢個誒疫權管又又等佢條條例生效喎？咁呢個問題咧，我覺得就值得我哋委員會去討論嘅。係阿郭榮亨議員，主席啊，誒。

262
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:42,480
即係我正式提把呢個議程咧，係擺上我哋呢個司法事務委員會嘅誒誒議程嘅事項裏邊咧。噉我哋有時間，我哋就叫局方上嚟。到時再麻煩一次，阿陳景生資深大律師同埋佢嘅委員咧，係再上嚟一次啊，或者可以當面。

263
00:58:42,480 --> 00:59:02,490
問一問佢哋究竟發生緊咩事？係因為當日我哋呢批，我諗除咗少數咧，我哋係冇參與到當日嗰個即係條例啦。噉我哋都希望更新下，同埋因為你哋嘅建議係同嗰樣嘢掛鈎，你哋嘅條例、你哋嘅建議要條例生效，噉我覺得我哋係值得。噉我覺得誒，我哋會。

264
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:19,080
都誒剔啊，大家嘅意見，我哋將佢擺喺咧誒可行嘅時間，我哋會編配嘅嚇。咁多謝啊，陳敬生主席同埋其他嘅代表誒，今日上嚟同我哋誒簡介咗翼權管有嘅建議。

265
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:25,560
咁咧誒，跟住我哋就會進入下一個議程啦。咁多謝陳主席。

266
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:47,140
下一個議程咧，就係法律改革委員會關於刑事訴訟程序條例附表三所列嘅例外罪行嘅報告書。咁誒相關嘅文件係C B括弧四二六四足十三-hyphen十四括弧零七，就係發稿。

267
00:59:47,140 --> 01:00:04,180
委會關於刑事訴訟程序條例附表三所列嘅例外罪行嘅報告書嘅摘要，咁根據二二一章咧，法庭係唔可以就住附件三所列嘅例外罪行選擇判處緩刑。

268
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:19,070
咁所以咧，而家咧嘅制度有一啲嚴重嘅罪行咧，就唔會擺喺附表附表三之內，但係一啲輕微嘅罪行咧，就列咗喺附表三。咁法改會喺今年嘅二月二十五號咧，就發表咗。

269
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:35,320
刑事訴訟程序條例附表三嘅報告書嚇例外罪行嘅建議廢除附表三嘅例外罪行，以便法官同埋裁判官咧可以基於罪行嘅情況作出公正同埋適當嘅判刑。

270
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,480
亦都可以選擇暫緩執行或者係扣押嘅懲罰等等。

271
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:58,840
咁而家咧就先請法改會處理秘書長晏善華女士介紹刑事訴訟程序條例附表三所列嘅例外造行嘅報告書，跟住我哋會請大律師公會嘅代表發言嘅。

272
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,780
好。

273
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,490
Thank you.

274
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:19,820
Yes. Thank you. The LRC report, as you've said, was published on the 25th of February this year, and it was proposing the repeal of accepted offences listed in Schedule Three to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.

275
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:33,600
the the problem is that under the ordinance, suspended sentences as an option is not available to the court in respect of the offences listed in the schedule to the ordinance.

276
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:46,650
however, there appear to be some anomalies in this list of accepted offences, in that some serious offences are not on the list, while some less serious ones are on the list.

277
01:01:47,220 --> 01:02:00,790
例如，一名犯人 convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under thirteen， which is currently not an accepted offence， may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment but suspended.

278
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:17,840
In contrast, the court has no discretion but to impose a term of immediate imprisonment for an offender convicted of attempted indecent assault, where a non-custodial sentence is not appropriate because it is listed as an accepted offence.

279
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:24,970
such a state of affairs can give rise to a general sense of unfairness and arbitrariness.

280
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:37,380
by way of background, the concept of suspended sentences was introduced to Hong Kong under the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill in 1971.

281
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:54,890
和的creation of accepted offences was the result of strong opposition to the bill from the unofficial members of the Legislative Council at that time, who had expressed concern about the sharp increase in the rate of crime.

282
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:10,210
The LRC believes that the public sentiments behind the creation of accepted offences some 40 years ago have long gone, and that the original rationale for having accepted offences no longer applies.

283
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:23,350
The LRC published a consultation paper on the topic in June 2013, and the consultation period ended in September 2013.

284
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:36,960
those in favour of the proposal included the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society, who generally endorsed the consultation paper's rationale for repealing the entire Schedule Three.

285
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:46,540
overall, 39 responses were received. 28 were in favour, five were against, and six were neutral.

286
01:03:47,530 --> 01:04:04,960
The LRC believes that judges and magistrates should not be restricted from exercising their discretion to achieve a just and appropriate sentence, depending on the circumstances of the offence and the offender, including the option of suspending custodial sentences.

287
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:18,480
of the jurisdictions studied that have a similar suspended sentence power, none of them has maintained exceptions as wide and extensive as those currently applying in Hong Kong.

288
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,210
The LRC welcomes the views of members of the panel.

289
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:32,500
好，咁跟住我哋請誒大律師公會嘅代表，Mr. Andrew Bruce，please。

290
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:38,120
Thank you. The Bar Association strongly supports this.

291
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,420
This proposal, we take the view that judges.

292
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:51,520
今天， probably yesterday， are well equipped to make judgments about when it is right to suspend a sentence.

293
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:58,310
for most of the offences on this list， you would never think of suspending the sentence anyway。

294
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:06,150
for a number of reasons. First of all, the offence is inherently serious. You notice the list starts with manslaughter.

295
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:14,660
The other thing is that you have to make a decision to impose a sentence of imprisonment first, and then decide.

296
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,820
要，suspend it。

297
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:30,120
And you can only do so. You can only impose a sentence of a maximum of two years, and you can only suspend it for three years. So we're talking about at maximum pretty low level offences.

298
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,390
and。

299
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:41,560
如果法官或 magistrate 做錯事，有上訴程序，包括檢察院有很強的審核權。

300
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,050
嗯。

301
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,450
The.

302
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:45,760
誒。

303
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:52,690
這係其實係 quite a modest proposal, very small proposal in its own way, and.

304
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,290
It seems to me that.

305
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:07,670
for serious offences, there's going to be no change. It's just going to be where another option, possibly the rehabilitation or reformation of the offender.

306
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:08,880
where。

307
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:22,840
他或她做某樣錯事，單一個案，有個更好的處理方式。所以，因為這些原因，律師公會強烈支持這個建議。

308
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:40,320
OK，thank you，Mr. Andrew Blus。啊，而家咧，我哋就係請咁多各位委員誒發問。咁暫時咧就只有郭榮亨啊議員。噉我哋就誒都係建議五分鐘，但係我會寬鬆啲處理噉樣啦，好冇？跟住有吳亮星議員。

309
01:06:41,050 --> 01:07:01,060
郭榮亨議員係主席。誒，其實呢個議程誒，我睇到就係誒嗰個理據都好清楚。因為如果相反睇翻誒嗰個文件裏邊咧，其實你話有冇話真係理據係誒講話點解唔應該取消呢個呢樣嘢咧？

310
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:21,070
咧就只有第十段嗰度輕輕提到，就話因為嗰陣時一九七零年嗰個社會氣氛係需要對於呢啲噉樣嘅嚴重罪行咧，係嗰個懲處係好好嚴格嘅。咁但係呢個我相信即係時代轉變咗。誒，而家香港二十一世紀啦，我哋誒嗰個法院同埋誒。

311
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:41,080
司法人員咧，亦都係已經啊作咗咁多，有咁多年嚟嘅一個啊進步同埋成熟啦。其實真係嗯嗰個今日啊局方提嗰個嘅建議，其實都係好成熟，同埋我相信爭議性都唔大。咁嗯至於就係嗰個我睇到第十三。

312
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:56,260
三段嗰度咧，有八成嘅司法人員咧都係贊成應該取消呢呢呢一個啊啊exceptional offences呢樣嘢嘅，咁所以我我哋公民黨係會贊成呢個嘅啊取消。

313
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,320
好。

314
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,370
跟住係吳亮生議員。誒，多謝主席。

315
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:17,390
就住第十八段關於個五位回應者嘅反對意見嗰度咧，即係我注意咗，除咗有誒婦女組織啊、風雨難呢啲，都屬於嗰嗰嗰個即係嗰啲嘅性質嘅N.G.O啊。

316
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:37,680
咁誒，其他有當然有律師，咁誒，但係更重要嘅咧就警務處處長係其中一位。噉我先要感覺到係咪因為佢哋喺執法嘅？咁如果睇到呢部分嘅誒取消，會係引致某啲方面。

317
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:55,590
喺執法方面遇到嘅問題咧，噉係咪喺呢度可唔可以作少少少量嘅補充畀我哋知道？誒，佢即係警務處長嘅意見，同埋你哋點樣對佢嘅意見考慮過之後，誒又認為有啲咩嘢嘅唔同意？

318
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,210
Miss Ainsworth， please。

319
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:06,810
我我我 believe that the reason was basically a maintenance of the status quo and.

320
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:18,150
The Commission felt that maintaining the status quo was not the appropriate way forward on this, and that the majority view was in favour of reform.

321
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:39,650
誒係，但係同同時咧，嗱，我我住呢個方面咧，就亦有第五，即係有第五點嘅提議嘅就係，如果係認為有啲保留或者認為有需要再繼續，但係未必係全部刪除嘅話，第五點嘅誒意見咧就。

322
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:59,660
就係話修訂附表三，而唔係將佢全部廢除。咁呢點嘅考慮有冇咩特別係有修訂嘅必要？誒，即係嗱，如果就噉樣提修訂，當然唔係最好嘅啦。係修訂邊啲？有冇當時修改啲噉嘅資料？

323
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,930
噉你哋都考慮成點咧？

324
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:05,980
嗯。

325
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:24,030
The Law Reform Commission report at paragraph 5.19 talks about the difficulty of the arbitrary nature of picking and choosing between certain offences to include and certain to exclude.

326
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,050
and it concluded that.

327
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:32,650
It was better to take a wholesale approach than to take an arbitrary line.

328
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:53,530
誒嗱，呢啲困難各樣嘢咧，我相信咧，今後誒類似呢啲噉樣突然之間用咗一段時間就會撤銷啊！呢啲咧，我雖然同意就係政即係嗰個政局或者當時嘅七零年嘅時候嘅一啲情況係，佢不即係已經唔能夠。

329
01:10:53,530 --> 01:11:13,540
相提並論，但係咧，凡親誒完全取消同通過曾經修訂過之後咧，係應該有有兩個階段嘅，即係採取唔同嘅。噉我個人傾向咧，誒，我冇細緻研究呢啲誒附件三。

330
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:33,550
嘅誒係到而家為止，真係咪誒包括警方佢哋喺執法嘅時候誒所即係感覺到會取消曬咧個壓力，對誒再發生類似嘅一啲誒情況嘅機會同埋嗰個誒阻嚇作用嘅。

331
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:51,710
嘅考慮啦，噉我冇冇研究過，不過咧，我始終覺得係社會嘅進步咧，都係會逐步嘅。噉啊，有修訂然後再取消咧，係更好。噉我只有表達咗依個意見啫。好，咁咧跟住係阿梁國雄議員，誒誒，Miss。

332
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:57,350
Answorth，can you speak closer to the microphone? Sorry，we can't hear too clearly. Sorry，thank you.

333
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,320
當年突然間提出，即係話有啲嘢不能夠判緩刑，咁其實就係。

334
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:11,600
非常粗暴啦，係咪？咁所以你改變佢嘅時候都要好粗暴啦。

335
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,740
我當年都唔合理嘅，其實。

336
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,550
誒。

337
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:19,870
即係警務處長講嘅嘢，我覺得真係都唔知講咗去邊。

338
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:27,120
唔，呢唔係佢嘅工作嚟嘅。你負責捉人嘅啫嘛，你負責檢控嘅啫嘛。點都唔係佢添喎，負責捉人。

339
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:34,050
咁呢個律政處走去檢控咩嘅罪，又唔係佢去理嘅，噉啊理乜嘢啫？佢喺度。

340
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:37,390
即係根本就九，即係講句唔好聽，九唔搭八。

341
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:47,560
即係如果如果噉樣都得嘅，即係佢就係就覺得可能就會畀個意見㗎咯，就話呢個法庭嘅定罪率過低。

342
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,490
咁都得嘅，即係我哋咁辛苦捉人。

343
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,200
咁拎咗嚟告，噉你哋又放咗佢。

344
01:12:54,930 --> 01:13:08,300
即係我覺得根本都即係人哋，其實我覺得稍微懂邏輯嘅人都明咧，即係話嗰個法庭嘅酌情權更加充分咁行使啊嘛，係咪？即係話哦，如果有個有啲罪行。

345
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,770
係可以誒？

346
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,770
即係配門型咯，配門型咯，咁嗰啲。

347
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,820
將嗰啲誒好。

348
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,850
重嘅罪行，你估法官會畀緩刑咩？我未聽過，真係。

349
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:25,300
所以其實就多餘嘅，因為當年太過籠統，就溝埋曬啲嘢佢。

350
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:31,780
咁解啫嘛，係咪？咁所以我覺得，即係如果係畀翻個酌情權畀。

351
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,140
法庭咧合適嘅，因為其實有有啲就係因為。

352
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:37,920
過重又唔得，噉啊，反而過輕。

353
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:58,650
就咁解啊嘛！阿吳吳生，你明唔明啊？即係個意思就係，即係如果你硬硬話冇得換刑，噉佢咪跌咗落去過輕咯？即係可能要畀啲輕啲嘅咯。所以我我覺得畀翻佢又冇冇問題嘅，即係嗰啲法官。不過當然，如果法官做得唔好，係另一回事呢個。即係話佢誒恢復咗。

354
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,850
所有個誒呢一個。

355
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:04,550
酌情權即係話有啲嘢佢判緩刑，咁呢個。

356
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,160
佢如果行使個權力係差嘅時候咧，你就另一個問題嚟㗎。

357
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,920
即係你畀你畀啲自由嗰啲人嗰啲人行使自由唔好嘅噉，另一個問題嚟嘅。即係，但係我覺得。

358
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:25,290
即係，既然間一九七零年嗰陣時係做得太籠統啦，咁今次一次過將佢恢復翻之後，咪睇下個實際上做成點咯。

359
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:31,360
我睇法係噉。好，誒，需唔需要啊？Miss Answorth。

360
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,840
去答。

361
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:39,000
嚇。O K，咁咧就誒好啊，謝偉俊議員。

362
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:59,330
多謝主席。主席，我原則上亦都誒，同律師會、大律師公會同埋八十個percent嘅司法嘅誒法官一樣咧，都覺得咧係需要誒，而家採立啊法改會嘅建議咧係合適嘅，因為我哋誒七零年代嘅所擔心嘅咧，而家的而且確係已經係時勢咧係過咗。

363
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:19,340
其特別，我哋嘅司法人員嘅質素方面咧，我相信今時今日嘅香港社會咧，都相對係接受佢哋係屬於優質嘅。咁所以能夠多啲畀佢嘅酌情權咧，少啲佢嘅掣肘咧，呢個係合適嘅。不過我想理解下誒，或者因為再一次咧，我有啲遺憾就係我哋律政司方面咧係冇代表在場咧，就有關法改。

364
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:39,350
會嘅建議咧，佢哋初步嘅睇法點樣？咁如果佢贊成嘅話，幾時到？有咩時間？佢哋會考慮改呢個修改入入翻法例。咁呢方面，我唔知我哋有咩可以跟進啦。但係我希望或者以後下一次有機會有呢個呢類性質嘅報告嘅時候，係咪應該都啊有政司代表在場咧，會更加恰當咧？咁呢個第一點想睇一睇咧。第二，我想要。

365
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:59,360
家下我唔知我哋有冇記錄咧，就特別我就有關嗰啲誒share use fee，即係嗰個列取出嚟嗰啲罪行裏邊咧。雖然我原則上同意話係全部應該係廢除曬啦，但係由於特別我理解到，亦都由於以往誒執業上遇到呢啲嘅經驗咧，特別有關於譬如話非禮案件啊，誒。

366
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,090
喺第第六行嗰度咧，又或者係第九行。

367
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:23,380
有關於係係藏有呢個攻擊性武器，呢啲可能係可以可大可小嘅一啲罪行嚟嘅。但係事實上咧，喺判刑嘅時候，如果有一個限制咗唔畀有一個緩刑嘅考慮嘅話咧，變咗。剛才兩個議員講得好啱曬，逼住本來係應該判重少少嘅佢，為咗咧咪有機會可以行使呢個誒緩刑咧，逼住減低咗個緩刑。

368
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:43,390
佢兩兩年之下係一個好人工化、被逼性嘅做法。咁呢方面，我唔知有任何律法界會嘅同事們，或者任何或者啊MissAndrewBruce啊，SeniorSupervisoryCounselinPrimal誒，關於嗰個誒有呢兩方面嘅困難，關於非禮案件同埋台油公職務會係咪特別多，係不公義嘅情況出現？

369
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:55,010
好，Missainsworth，啊，yeah，你係also member of DOJ right？但係你係now wearing the head of the law reform committee。yeah yes， that's right。

370
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,590
嗯。

371
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:06,690
in in relation to implementation, the the question on that, I believe that the report is being considered by the administration at the moment.

372
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:14,220
it it was only published relatively recently, so the recommendations are still being studied in detail.

373
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:21,010
Any ideas to when it will be sort of a decision will be made regarding the proposals by the law reform commission?

374
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:25,160
我唔可以comment on that，我唔sorry。

375
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:41,460
O.K. 啊，跟住係啊，劉慧卿議員。主席啊，誒，我想問下咧，因為講到第十八段嗰度話反對有關建議咧，就包括關注婦女性暴力協會同埋風雨蘭。

376
01:17:41,840 --> 01:18:01,850
咁都係兩方面都係即係好關心嗰啲嚇對女性嗰啲嗰啲性暴力啊嗰啲，噉佢哋反對個主席，其實真係當局係咪亦即係或者法工委會諗得好清楚咧？即係其實頭先啊，主席話另外我哋會再處理會後，即係處理嗰個咩咩個屏障啊。

377
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:16,780
畀佢受審啊！係啦，嗰啲其實嗰啲咁少嘅嘢都做咗咁多年都做唔到，而家又再搞啲嘢喺度，令到佢哋好唔安心。咁實在即係即係大家點睇㗎？即係你哋明唔明白嗰啲婦女嗰啲憂慮嘅咧嚇？

378
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,110
嗨，Miss Ainsworth。

379
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:37,730
The concern of the women groups. Yes, the concern of the women's groups was aired during the consultation exercise, and it was taken very careful account of by the law reform commission in formulating its final recommendations.

380
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,060
但係， the

381
01:18:40,910 --> 01:19:00,920
the consideration was that this would only ever be used in very rare cases where the circumstances of the defendant was such that imposing mandatory imprisonment would not be appropriate. So perhaps with very young defendants, boyfriend-girlfriend situations.

382
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,320
things like that, so that's why.

383
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:20,100
They decided in the end that even even with relation to something like indecent assault and sexual offences, that it should be also included in the list to be repealed.

384
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:41,300
所以，Madam Chairman， has that been explained to these women's groups, particularly Rain Lily, because they really have very genuine concern and concern that the administration is not very sensitive about their worries, and also the legal profession, because I understand the legal profession doesn't want to have the screen.

385
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:59,280
在法院，所以，但係這些係非常真實的擔憂，已經表達了很多年，而且似乎他們一直都被忽略，而且很多女性受到攻擊，而且他們沒有得到多少保護。這是非常非常遺憾的狀況。

386
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:08,750
Hi, Miss Swythe. Well, I am just expressing the final conclusion that the law reform commission came.

387
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,280
但。

388
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:17,070
it obviously it will be something that the administration will need to consider when it's looking at implementing the recommendations.

389
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:23,370
Well, Madam Chair, I think it's very important for the administration to take all these points on board.

390
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:43,660
I mean, okay, there may be very strong reasons for taking forward the recommendations, but the worries of the women's groups should be considered very seriously, and to you know set their minds at ease, rather than to just say, oh go ahead, go away, you are just a minority. I just don't think this is acceptable.

391
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,750
yeah。

392
01:20:46,040 --> 01:21:06,050
我希望啊，MissAngus你聽到啦，但唔止聽到噉嘅咁簡單嘅，因為咧今日就啊有兩有幾位佢特別關心呢方面嘅問題嘅議員，啱啱亦都唔喺度咧。頭先劉偉興議員咧亦提咗，我自己都係想即係跟進呢方面嘅問題，因為咧喺啊，其實喺上一屆。

393
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:26,060
我哋一樣係誒有幾有幾次聽證會，就係關於嗰個性罪行嘅受害人希望有屏障咁咧，亦都係同樣嘅呢幾個嘅，起碼裏邊有一啲係誒重疊嘅嗰啲婦女團體啦。佢哋最擔心咧就係話你係誒修改咗呢個法例。

394
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:46,070
嗰個誒畀社會上一個信息，好似咧就會係判輕咗嗱。即係我係因為咧，我見到所有嘅都係冇其他意見，我係補充翻講翻出嚟咧。噉佢哋係有一個誒關注喺度㗎，我記得。咁而呢個關注咧，我亦都好好記得嗰，亦都係Mr.Drew Bruce喺度佢一。

395
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:56,770
定係好好支持呢一次嘅噉嘅修改嘅。嗱，呢個修改咧係對我自己都認為咧係對於答辯方咧係係當然係係更加受歡迎。

396
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:17,060
嗱，當然咧，客觀地講咧，我唔覺得將呢樣嘢畀咗誒法庭咧，佢一定會輕判嘅。即係其實，即係法庭佢擁有呢個酌情權多啲咧。其實佢可能對於嚴重啲嘅情況，佢都唔會輕輕放過嘅。只不過咧，即係誒，確實即係我我都要提出咧，嗰啲婦女團體。

397
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:37,070
佢哋提出嗰個憂慮，即係話可能令到一啲特別，可能係誒年青嘅佢有時對於特別你講嗰啲係誒性罪行啊、猥瑣行為啊，即係類似呢一啲，即係好似可能嗰個感覺啊，係啦，你修改啦，噉係咪輕啲咧？咁所以呢個我哋都係要求，我記得上次都係講你哋。

398
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:49,890
修改咧，你要做足嗰個推廣咧，就係即係要令到佢知道咧。嗱，去咗酌情權就唔係話咧，就係可以覺得係輕輕咗嘅，只不過嗰個酌情權係喺嗰個法庭。

399
01:22:50,170 --> 01:23:05,600
但係咧，我都希望你解釋下啦，即係頭先，因為同事都係支持八十個percent嘅司法人員啦。咁另外嗰二十個percent嘅司法人員，其實佢係憂慮啲乜嘢咧？你哋會唔會可以都講下，喺我哋委員會裏邊作一個好清楚嘅記錄咧？

400
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:23,630
係十三段裏邊，即係你八十個percent絕大部分，噉你頭先都用嘅very rare cases，咁即係有啦，有rare cases啊嘛。噉你可唔可以解釋得清楚少少？即係我哋對呢啲關注嘅婦女團體同埋反對嘅意見，我哋都係有一個清楚嘅交代咧。

401
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:31,240
第十三段，即係你八十一percent，即係有二十一percent係即係唔贊成啦。

402
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,610
係司法人員裏邊都。

403
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,900
啊！

404
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:43,350
the the situation with the judges again, I think it was.

405
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:53,010
Right, I'm sorry. It's at paragraph five point four three.

406
01:23:53,290 --> 01:24:07,020
《The LRC Report》它説，幾位法官和司法官員，who did not experience difficulty arising from the statutory restriction，accordingly saw no need to remove such restriction.

407
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:18,980
and then the reasons for the minority view that the statutory restriction should be retained are as follows, and it lists four reasons.

408
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:24,250
4A， indecent assault cases are becoming prevalent.

409
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:30,560
B. The offence under section 33 of Cap 245 is serious.

410
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:35,850
C. Removing the restriction may send a wrong message to the public.

411
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:40,770
and D removal needs community consultation.

412
01:24:41,180 --> 01:25:01,190
所以頭先嗰個意見裏邊嚇係有提到係錯誤嘅信息，同埋其實係誒有嗰個趨勢，亦都有機會係增加嘅。咁如果喺呢一方面嚟講，

413
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:08,950
講咧，佢即係即係佢嗰度嗰啲司法人員就係即係做諮詢啦。噉我哋諮詢，我哋有我哋有團體要表達個意見。

414
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:27,460
誒，我諗咧，我哋委員會誒喺呢一方面咧，頭先啊，我哋聽到咧，我哋委員可能都有一啲唔同嘅誒保留嘅嚇。噉，不如我又問下大家嚇嗰個嘅意見啦嚇。咁咧就啊。

415
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:31,820
基本上仲有冇委員要補充發言？

416
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,960
嚇，咁咧就誒，如果冇嘅咧就。

417
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:59,360
我諗主席係有少時間，我想send you back誒回應翻我剛才問個問題。究竟喺嗰個非禮案件同埋喺嗰個喺誒藏有攻擊性武器嘅方面，佢經驗嚟講咧，係咪有依方面嘅困難，或者冇依個方面困難？好啊，阿謝偉俊議員想跟進嘅係你哋，可唔可以都補充畀資料我哋？

418
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:07,700
係。sorry，我係問Mr. Andrew Bruce，你個你嗰邊你嗰邊左邊先啱係。哦，OK，我我你你係address畀Mr. Andrew Bruce手啊。

419
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:25,370
Mr Andrews, the questions are addressed to. Yes, as far as indecent assault, I don't have statistics, but it is my strong impression that this is an offence which has increased in the last 10, maybe 15 years.

420
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:33,700
但那，as that has happened, the range of circumstances in which it is committed.

421
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:38,010
have also been demonstrated to be very wide.

422
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:39,790
and。

423
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:58,320
Let us not forget that a suspended sentence, the law says it can only be imposed in exceptional circumstances. That's what the law says. So you're not changing things all that much. So the accused person would have to demonstrate after conviction.

424
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:05,430
that this is a sentence which for good reason, compelling reason, should be suspended. So

425
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:19,390
你哋要理解，個change here is not that great。 for any other more serious sexual offence， for instance， rape。 The idea that you look， remember， if it's a sentence above two years

426
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:21,080
你唔可以 suspend 它。

427
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:28,020
所以，the idea of a sentence of two years or less for a rape is just plain silly.

428
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:38,960
as far as possession of offensive weapon, or for example, the offence is under the weapons ordinance. The next section down in this schedule.

429
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:59,380
There's also a range of of circumstances in which this occurs, from the silly young kid who gets himself in a tangle, to somebody who's carrying a weapon for quite nasty or violent purposes, possibly to do with public disorder, possibly to do with.

430
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,580
something more serious.

431
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:07,330
And it seems to the bar association to deny a magistrate or a judge.

432
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,710
The ability to make a judgement about.

433
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:19,920
seriousness of the offence, and let's not forget, deterrence is not the only sentencing concern. Reformation and rehabilitation.

434
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:40,280
are also concerns, and that would be something which might cry out for a suspended sentence. In other words, you do this again, young man or young woman, and we'll deal with you in a very different way. So it seems to the bar association that this is a circumstance where.

435
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:44,710
essentially trusting judicial officers to be sensible.

436
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:47,940
is is is a

437
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,110
嗯。

438
01:28:49,670 --> 01:29:09,680
A compelling argument. If I can just address one other thing, which is not on topic, for Miss Lao, there was a judgment of Justice Zervos about three months ago on screens for sexual offence cases, which I personally regard as a very powerful.

439
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:26,800
judgment, and I would think you probably won't need an amendment to the law after that judgment. But anyway, that's a topic for another time. But in case she was not unlikely, but in case she was not aware of that, I thought it right to bring it to her attention.

440
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,780
但，這些係。

441
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,410
As I say, the change here is not that great.

442
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:37,350
and it's a change which if it goes wrong.

443
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:58,030
The court of appeal has powers to put it right。嗯，係嗱，Mr. Andrew Bruce頭先都有講咗佢嗰個意見啦。噉我諗咧，我哋就想噉樣啊，即係你睇到有有保留意見嘅，其實都係最擔心就係話一個錯誤嘅信息啫。噉我見到咧，其實所列罪行就唔係淨係嗰啲。

444
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:18,040
性罪行嘅，其實仲有其他一啲，即係好可能，即係會容易被公眾誤解為咧，就係覺得輕，即係會判輕咗啦。噉你包括啊持槍啊，仲有其他等等啦嚇，無牌管有各方面。我覺得你哋係有需要係多少少啊，向公眾要解釋。

445
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:38,050
翻其實就唔係話咧係減輕咗嗰個即係誒嗰個判罰，而係將個酌情權交咗交翻畀法官，即係話對法官有一個更高嘅一個誒信任嘅。其實基本上咁嗰個就唔一定半輕㗎嘛。頭先都講到噉係。

446
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:58,060
誒，that's why即係嗰個原因就係點解八十個percent司法人員佢係同意咧。我哋係好理解嘅，即係佢用，即係佢可以根據當時嘅情況。咁但係我覺得你哋有責任要做翻呢樣嘢嚇，因為保留嘅司法人員都係怕一個錯誤嘅信息係誒發放畀社會。噉我咁呢個咧，我哋係喺。

447
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:10,070
喺記錄嗰度咧，我哋委員會係要作出呢一個嘅要求嘅嚇。噉我希望你哋都正式承諾，你哋會做翻呢一個向公眾嘅補充嘅誒解釋同埋誒宣講啦。

448
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:11,210
嚇！

449
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:37,060
係啊，Miss Ensor，呢個question係address。 yes， we will pass those comments on to the administration。 yes，即係希望唔係就咁pass啦，即係我哋係有噉嘅要求嚇，噉係對一啲誒關注嘅團體咧係一個交代，好冇啊嚇？OK，咁多謝你哋先，咁跟住咧就係。

450
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,640
我哋係進入下一個議題。

451
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,930
thank you，誒。

452
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:51,470
建議咧就係律政司民事法律科開設一個副首席政府律師常額職位嘅。

453
01:31:51,750 --> 01:32:04,260
咁咧就文件咧就係C B括弧四二六四stroke十四-hyphen十五括弧零八，政府當局提議建議在律政司民事法律科開設一個職位。

454
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,160
誒，另外一個文件就係《闕湖零九》。

455
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:14,330
就係立法會秘書處就有關議題啊，擬備嘅。

456
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:27,030
建議嘅背景資料簡介，咁律政司而在民事法律科開始一個副首席政府律師常額職位。

457
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:45,480
起薪點係第二點，由二零一五年四月一號起生效，以取代二零一五年四月一號到期撤銷嘅現有副首席政府律師編外職位。當局建議開設該職位，係為了推展。

458
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:53,860
持續提倡同埋推廣香港更廣泛使用調解作為解決爭議方法嘅工作。

459
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:59,380
並處理關於調解同其他解決爭議方式的職務。

460
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:05,520
咁而家我哋先請律政司嘅代表簡介當局提交嘅討論文件。

461
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:09,650
噉就請誒律政司嘅代表。

462
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:15,010
係誒主席，就誒。

463
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:35,640
律政司咧，其實咧早於喺誒二零零七年咧，其實已經承諾咗咧係長期肩負提倡同埋推動香港更廣泛使用調解，係以解決爭議嘅工作。噉就誒喺最新嘅施政報告同埋財政預算案演詞咧，亦都係政府重申呢一個嘅承諾。

464
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:51,670
咁為咗推動呢樣工作咧，其實喺呢個二零一零年嘅九月咧，就已經係開設咗誒，我哋今日講到咧有一個咧叫做誒副首席誒政府律師嘅一個噉嘅職位。咁當時咧係誒用一個誒。

465
01:33:51,950 --> 01:34:11,960
誒N.C.S.C.嗰個形式咧，開設咗三年嘅。咁跟住咧就係誒二零一三年咧，即係四月咧，就係用一個誒有時限嘅一個公務員噉嘅方式咧，就開設咗呢個位咧，做咗兩年。咁而家因為咧，我哋睇到咧誒呢個誒職位咧個。

466
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:25,820
個工作咧，其實係恆常嘅。噉我哋未來一路都要做落去。咁誒，主要嚟講咧，誒呢一個嘅誒副首席政府律師咧，佢咧係負責咧係一個誒，即係誒。

467
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:46,110
我哋調解小組，即係佢作為一個誒，佢嗰個誒主管啦嚇。噉佢嘅工作咧就係誒第一咧就係要誒提供呢個誒秘書處服務畀一個由律政司司長做主席嘅誒調解督導委員會嚇。咁委

468
01:34:46,110 --> 01:35:06,120
委員會屬下咧係有三個嘅委員，誒係個誒小組委員會嘅嚇，咁亦都係由佢哋誒即係誒誒提供呢個支援啦。咁另外嘅工作咧係包括誒一啲譬如政策方面咧，就係要誒睇睇嗰個誒一啲誒關於喺調解嗰個誒。

469
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:26,130
雙方嗰個通訊裏面有啲咩闊面咧，可以咧就誒方便第日咧一啲人士咧係做一啲研究或者教育用途啦。咁亦都係誒研究緊呢個叫道歉法例啦嚇。咁誒實務工作有啲推廣方面咧，亦都要係舉辦一啲嘅誒，譬如呢個調解周啊，咁同埋咧就係。

470
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:46,140
要舉辦好多嘅講座啊，噉樣樣噉，亦都咧係一個工作咧，就係要監察呢個誒調評會嚇，就誒二零一三年成立以來嗰個運作嚇，睇下需唔需要作出一啲嘅改善。咁嗯，詳細嗰啲誒佢嗰個職責咧，就喺文件裡面嘅附件B嗰度有。咁另外咧，關於一啲。

471
01:35:46,140 --> 01:36:06,150
佢嗰個工作咧，亦都喺誒文件裏面第廿一、廿二段亦都有提及。咁咧就誒，我哋好希望咧能夠咧係開到呢一個嘅職位嚇。如果唔係咧，就變咗咧喺呢方面嘅工作咧係，如果開唔到啲職位咧，可能要停頓嘅。係多謝主席。好誒，多謝卓生誒咁咧。

472
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:10,170
誒，而家就係委員發言。誒，首先係郭榮亨議員。

473
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:16,220
多謝主席。係誒，我就想問一問咧，即係誒，當然誒。

474
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:36,510
喺呢個調解嘅工作上邊咧，我哋都係支持嗰個呢方面嘅發展，亦都睇到係有需要係增加人手嘅。咁但係咧，我睇緊就係嗰個誒而家嗰個civil division嗰個誒誒圖表咧。咁其實誒可唔可以誒邀請專員咧解釋一下邊位同事係負責？

475
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:48,720
推廣仲裁嘅，因為喺仲裁發展方面咧，你知道我我自己好關心依樣嘢啦。噉就想睇下佢人手方面係唔係都足夠咧，定係啊邊一位同事係負責咧噉樣？

476
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:50,970
係，卓生。

477
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:58,510
誒仲裁方面咧，其實而家咧就係呢個誒法律政策科嗰邊嘅同事咧係負責嘅。

478
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:19,310
咁如果人手嗰方面咧，誒係咪需要都相應增加咧？因為其實喺推廣仲裁嗰度咧，我哋香港確實係落後咗新加坡好多年嘅。咁其實人哋咧喺無論喺資源同埋人手方面咧，都擺好多誒誒落去嘅。咁所以我就想問，即係如果你增

479
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:28,640
增加人手去推廣呢個誒調解咧，誒喺仲裁方面咧，係咪亦都有噉嘅需要，係相應咁增加人手同埋資源咧？

480
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,550
係，阿卓主任。

481
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:50,840
主席，以我理解咧，誒，處方咧，亦都會係咧，就誒，或者係就呢個仲裁同埋呢個調解咧，可能誒喺未來會有一個再即係整體啲個嘅檢視，睇下係咪有有一個空間咧？譬如話將兩方面嘅工作係更加好嘅噉樣去去整合嘅嚇。

482
01:37:50,980 --> 01:38:00,770
即係遲啲會有誒誒新嘅建議上嚟，就係話，譬如增加仲裁推廣嗰方面嘅人手同埋資源，係咪？

483
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:21,490
出專員係我哋暫時未有呢個計劃，但係我哋不排除咧，即係任何嘅可能性嚇。即係視乎主要係我哋嗰個即係嗰個工作計劃啊，各方面啊，噉就要點樣要幾多人手噉樣嚇。係我我誒希望專員同埋其他律政司嘅同事可以喺呢一方面下多少少功夫，因為確實我哋如果再唔追翻。

484
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:41,500
翻嘅話咧，我哋有好多仲裁嘅案件咧，都係去咗啊新加坡嘅。因為最近，譬如我同啊律政司嘅同事去到緬甸咧，去推廣香港嘅仲裁啦。你問人哋咧，一開口佢話：我仲裁梗係去新加坡啦，即係佢諗都未諗過香港啊。點解咧？其實唔係話新加坡咩特別好，只不過人哋新加坡咧喺好多年。

485
01:38:41,500 --> 01:39:01,510
年前已經開始推廣，咁咧喺佢哋好多東南亞國家嘅嘅律師嘅心目中咧，如果講到仲裁就係自自然然會諗到新加坡。但係其實如果我哋依一方面出做得多啲功夫嘅話咧，其實可以追翻好多翻嚟。係卓專員，係主席或者我誒補充一啲，亦都同依個人手誒唔係有直接關係。

486
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:21,520
係嘅資料啦，噉係我哋其實律政司係非常之重視呢個即係推廣仲裁，香港作為一個仲裁中心嗰個工作。咁亦都係啱啱係早幾日咧，我哋都出咗一個係誒新聞嘅發布咧，亦都上咗網啦。其實咧就係我哋咧係話畀誒好多人聽咧，就將

487
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:41,530
會第日咧喺呢個政府，即係前政府合署嘅誒西座，同埋嗰個誒前呢個法國外方傳道會嗰個大樓咧，整棟咧係拎出嚟咧，係畀一啲法律相關組織去誒使用嘅嚇。噉我哋咧就係正式咧係邀請組織咧係提交佢哋嘅申請。咁咧就誒我哋。

488
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:54,530
係即係知道咧，喺呢方面咧，其實我哋係即係誒有好多功夫要做嚇。咁嗰方面，我諗其實係已經係做緊嘅，係亦都做得相當之積極嘅嚇。嗯，係個個議員。

489
01:39:54,810 --> 01:40:04,310
O.K.係，誒，我都有少少跟進啦。咁首先咧，我就係支持你哋呢個方向就。

490
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:07,990
加一啲資源咧，去推動調解。

491
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:22,020
誒，我諗一個社會，如果大家肯選擇用調解去解決問題咧，可能咧就誒比較多嘅爭議咧係可以大事化小，噉我覺得咧呢個係值得推廣嘅。

492
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:42,350
誒第二咧，我亦都係好高興你哋再提翻就係嗰個道歉嘅法例啦嚇，因為好多時社會嘅爭議係就係欠缺咗一句道歉，包括私人嘅問題，亦都係一樣。噉我覺得呢一方面嘅研究，我哋上次有參加你哋嗰個國際研討會咧，我覺得係誒係非。

493
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:47,970
非常之好嘅，噉我希望咧誒遲少少有一啲比較具體嘅嚇誒跟進啦。

494
01:40:48,280 --> 01:41:03,310
第三咧就係頭先啊誒，郭議員提到咧仲裁嗰個問題咧誒，嗱，的確咧就新加坡咧係誒好早係做得好好好嘅啊，就算我哋九三年我哋嗰陣時要。

495
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:23,620
誒去研究嗰個仲裁條例嘅時候咧，都真係首先就去咗新加坡去做參考。但係隨住咧，即係香港同內地嘅紛爭，特別係商業上嘅紛爭嗰個增加咧，其實我睇到咧，我哋香港嘅仲裁中心都係作為。

496
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:34,580
國際特別牽涉到同內地有嗰個爭議嘅時候咧，係一個佢哋喜歡選擇嘅地方，包括外國嘅投資者嚇。

497
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:54,870
係同內地嘅爭議，佢又會揀香港啦。誒，內地嘅又都會喜歡揀香港嘅喎，有啲噉。所以咧，誒喺呢一方面，我哋係積極，即係人哋咧好多時係國家係真係畀資源佢哋去promo去去推廣嘅。噉我哋香港其實而家就係啊～

498
01:41:54,870 --> 01:42:14,880
背靠呢個中國咧，其實好多嘅爭議，尤其是我哋香港喺普通法裏邊係有呢一個嘅優勢啊，所以咧應該係儘量係即係，我覺得係栽培同埋支持佢哋啦。噉你就因為頭先阿卓專員提到話搬office嗰度啫，噉啊少少提及，因為我哋即係之前啦，你都知呢度討論過呢個問題㗎。

499
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:27,460
咁亦都係瞭解過，就算仲裁中心裏邊嘅一啲同事咧都提過，即係搬咗之後可能冇咁方便啦。佢哋要多啲去推廣啊。當然你嗰個誒喺嗰個。

500
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:47,800
之前中審法院嗰個大樓嚇誒可以有綜合嘅呢啲服務咧係好嘅，不過即係我覺得誒嗰個推廣同埋政府嗰個支持嘅態度咧係可以令到佢哋做得更加好啦嚇。咁誒我都係表示支持嘅。噉我諗睇下誒。

501
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:56,830
係好，劉慧卿議員。阿阿主席啊，係原原則上咧，我都係支持嘅嚇。但係咧，就其實當局喺份文件嗰度咧。

502
01:42:57,110 --> 01:43:02,330
即係未來發展嗰幾段咧，都講咗好多嘢咧。其實佢都好似冇乜信心噉嘅。

503
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,220
咁亦都係，即係。

504
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:13,280
即係有啲人咧就好中意走去打官司，尤其是嗰啲財大氣粗嗰啲啦嚇，佢就話佢條氣唔順啊，啊！

505
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:33,570
咁所以咧就即係其實有冇啲數字覺得而家真係好多係走咗去做調解嘅咧？啲個案即係唔去法院啊，即係呢個其實好似你呢度講，即係都係有排搞。一方面係咪嗰啲調解員嘅質素係咪咁好啦？大家好有信心啦，同埋即係市民係越嚟越接受。

506
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:36,120
用呢個方法去處理啲紛爭咧？

507
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:56,710
係徐專員，主席，我諗首先要即係去即係坦白講咧，其實我哋冇全面嘅數字嘅，我哋而家主要掌握嘅數字咧係誒法院嘅一啲嘅公開嘅數字。咁喺嗰啲數字嚟睇咧，其實咧睇到咧，其實誒使用仲裁呢個誒呢個誒調解呢個方式咧，其實咧係呢啲個案。

508
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:09,900
係多咗，噉我哋誒自己政府亦都喺過去嗰幾年咧，亦都係做咗九十幾宗嘅，啊，咁而睇得到嗰個譬如喺法院啊，喺無論係呢個誒誒誒。

509
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:30,270
高院或者係喺呢個誒區域法院咧，其實嗰個睇到嗰個費用咧，其實係相對係即係相異，係講緊誒用嘅時間係講緊五六個鐘噉係誒萬七八蚊咧，噉就可以解決一個噉嘅個案。咁即係我哋係誒覺得咧係誒，即係呢一個要建立我哋喺嗰個未。

510
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:50,280
誒未來路向嗰度講，我哋要建立呢一個噉嘅調解嗰個文化咧，其實相信係誒，亦都誒，當然市民對於呢方面咧，亦都要加深認識。噉我哋咧就係喺今年嘅三月咧，就出咗呢個一個新嘅一個宣傳短片啊，同埋喺電台嘅聲帶啊，咁亦都搞咗一個叫誒呢個仲裁周嚇。

511
01:44:50,280 --> 01:45:10,290
咁裡面咧，其實咧就請咗好多誒，包括譬如中小企係就請咗佢哋特別咧嚟我哋一啲嘅某一啲嘅誒講座啊噉樣樣。咁喺即係，即使即係少少係因為可能係移風易俗嚇咁咧，即係其實係正如主席講係好多好處嘅。咁但係我哋諗依度依個推廣咧係會有一個過程。

512
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:30,460
噉我哋係會，亦都諗緊咧，就係點樣樣能夠將嗰啲即係即係數字，可能我哋真係未必短期可以收集得好齊全。但係即係除咗喺法庭嗰個數字之外，究竟係咪可以第啲地方我哋可以收集到啲數字咧？依個我哋係正係即係正在係研究緊。好，跟住咧係，好，我覺得。

513
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:41,780
即係嗰啲數字啊、數據嗰各樣嘢，皆要收集啦。如果你話要要使多啲錢啊，各樣嘢，咁同埋咧，即係如果老實講，即係有啲嘢係好嘅咧。

514
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:45,040
香港人咧就好醒嘅，主席。

515
01:45:45,450 --> 01:46:05,460
有乜理由有啲嘢好，佢唔會爭住要啫？即係即係應該就搶住要㗎嘛，係咪啊？又咁好，又咁短時間，又咁平，又解決曬，哇！應該蜂擁湧嘅嚟搞㗎嘛，係咪咧？咁咁而冇出現，咁實在係咩原因咧？咁好明顯，佢就唔係覺得咁值得，咁值得要啦。

516
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:25,470
咁成日，當局有冇考慮過咧？好似講到咁好啊，咁平啊，咁平靚正啦，應該就真係爭住嚟要嘅喎。嗯，咁個同埋我頭先問嗰啲調解員啲質素啊，各樣嘢，同埋個口碑啊嘛，即係有人做過口碑好，即係你去過餐廳食過好正啊，噉樣你有好嘅口碑，好多人話哇係。

517
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:30,760
好喎，我都爭住去㗎啦。噉你呢個情況冇出現喎，係點解咧？

518
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:39,670
嗯，卓專員係誒，或者我先誒嘗試解答咁睇下，我哋誒阿賴生或者阿李生有冇補充？

519
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:59,960
正如頭先講啦，其實咧誒，雖然我哋話推廣呢個調解咧係誒推廣咗幾年啦，咁但係其實咧係譬如今年大家睇到係比較我哋個力度大啲啦，二零一四年啦咁噉，相信其實係要做多啲，即係喺市民方面，譬如我哋睇到一啲誒，譬如就算日常生活嚇噉，我哋係為咗譬如環保處。

520
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:19,970
啊！誒，食環境衞生署啊，我哋都幫啲同事咧，啲政府嘅部門咧，亦都咧係即係推介咗呢個誒誒調解畀佢哋嘅嚇。咁咧就希望佢哋好多啲簡單，如啲流於滲水啊之類嗰啲咧，係可以能夠用多啲呢一方面嗰個嗰個誒誒，作為一個爭解決爭議嗰個方。

521
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:39,980
啊，噉我相信係我喺我哋喺宣傳方面咧，係要再加大啲力度嘅。咁但係睇下其他同事有冇補充？係賴專員。啊，多謝主席啊，或者我補充嘅又誒，實上推動呢個調解係作為三方面咧都要下功夫嘅。第一個司法部，第二啊政府，第三咧就民間嘅方面嘅喺政府。

522
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:59,990
方面，頭先啊，我我哋同事已經阿卓生已經解釋過噉樣。實際我哋透過呢個誒呢個誒調解督導委員會咧，實同埋核嗱個三個小組咧，已經做咗好多功夫。特別係宣傳嗰方面咧，好似今年三月嘅時候咧，就有呢個誒調解嘅大規模嘅調解嘅會議，同埋廿四個嘅調解嘅講座嗰度啊。

523
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:20,000
啊！我相信主席都有參加其中一個大型嗰個推動嗰個活動噉樣啊，嗰個收效都非常之唔錯噉樣。同埋咧，政府就誒呢呢一未來呢一兩年咧，集中喺嗰個九個界別嗰度，包括中小企啊、金融界啊、誒工商界啊、醫學界啊、教育界啊、誒呢個樓宇大樓嘅管理。

524
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:40,010
啊！加市界啊，嗰度咧都係呢個大事，呢個推動呢個調改工作。相信今後咧就唔會改變啊。實際施政報告同埋呢個誒呢個誒呢個呢呢呢個誒財政預算報告嗰度，亦都係講到係一個政府嘅常規政策嚟嘅。所以我哋今我哋今次咧亦都係提出誒呢呢個誒誒設呢個常額。

525
01:48:40,010 --> 01:49:00,020
嘅嘅嘅嘅副首席呢個誒政府律師嗰個職位，繼續咧去推廣呢個調解工作啦。呢個政府方面嘅下功夫啊，司法部嗰方面咧，石上咧喺呢個二零誒一零年一月份咧，就頒布呢個實務守則第三十一條嗰度咧，就喺規定嗰個誒誒嗰個誒誒進行呢個。

526
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:20,030
個誒訴訟嗰個誒類別嗰度咧，如果係唔進行呢個調解咧，咁第日就算官司勝訴咧，喺法庭咧係有權咧係將嗰個誒法庭個堂費嗰度咧係作一個適當嘅考慮嘅，得啊嘛。即係如果冇好嘅理由咧，可能會減少甚至冇唔畀嗰個堂費都未定嘅。咁呢個個。

527
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:40,040
司法部嗰個下嘅功夫，相信咧就係即係不為預嚟嘅方面都誒，好大家都好清楚。咁除咗司法部同埋呢個政府嘅推動嘅方面咧，喺民間嘅推動，我哋有我哋而家成立咗個調評會啊。調評會亦都大事咧，係宣傳呢個調解個功夫，同埋加入其他啲民間各類嘅誒調解嘅組織咧。我相信今後。

528
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:43,800
嚟講啊，喺呢方面嚟講，亦都係誒會會誒會會。

529
01:49:44,080 --> 01:50:04,090
繼續推廣呢個調解嗰個好處，同埋喺無論喺時間嘅方面同埋金錢嘅方面咧，等啲市民多啲認識啊。噉啊，同埋唔隻止市民啊，同埋業界，包括律師在內咧，係即係繼續推廣呢個誒呢個喺民間度推廣呢個調解嗰個功用、個功能嗰度嘅。

530
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:11,400
達達達到呢個啊，多啲使用呢個調解個方面嗰個主席啊，有冇有冇聽過啲好好嘅口碑啊？

531
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:31,790
即係用過嗰啲人話，誒好正喎，一定要搞啊！有冇咧嚇？你有冇聽過？抑或其實嗰班人做完翻嚟話，你千祈唔好鬥佢，真係冇用㗎。即係你有冇聽到啊？你講畀我聽。係主席嗱，就好坦白講句，即係如果你係個統計數字，我我就畀唔到誒阿阿阿阿劉議員噉。

532
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:51,800
不過噉嘅，譬如啲數字，我哋上一次都好似。唔係數字，我講口碑，你有冇聽過啊？有冇人贊過話喺度猛咁推薦，抑或個個柴台嘅？你聽過啊？啊，主席，嗯，劉議員，佢呢個噉嘅誒嘅講法咧，我哋都明白嘅。喺我哋二零一三年，我哋做過一個嘅就調解為先嘅誒嘅會。

533
01:50:51,900 --> 01:51:11,910
噉我哋咧，亦都係啊揾到一個真係用過嘅用家，佢作咗一個經驗嘅交流。佢真係覺得係調解係為佢解決咗個問題，因為佢用咗時間、用咗金錢喺嗰個誒誒嗰個誒法庭嗰度做咗好多功夫，但係即係未可能都未知之數，真係會最後尾會點樣？佢唔知，但係。

534
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:31,920
透過調解真係好快速解決咗問題。我哋明白到，我哋亦都睇到其他唔同國家嘅經驗係需要時間建立，最緊要建立就係誒用家市民對調解嘅信心。我哋喺過去幾年，我哋著咗做咗好多功夫，就係製造嗰個規管架構，係誒即係誒我哋係令到我哋嘅資格資力誒調。

535
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:40,500
解員資歷問題咧，我哋做咗好多功夫，我哋已經有好多係調解員喺度。噉我哋下一步，我哋繼續要做多啲嘅功夫咧，就係推廣。

536
01:51:40,780 --> 01:52:00,790
同埋咧，真係好似頭先啊，議員咁講，我哋希望多啲嘅宣傳係係有一個經驗嘅交流。當然，亦都係要明白到係調解係需要保密，但係令到多啲人有真係嗰個感受潛移默化噉，令到佢哋咧就係知道調解好處係邊一度啊。或者我都係。

537
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:20,800
個宣傳短片個口號咧就係調解為先，互利雙贏啊！實際上喺三月份咧就推出呢個宣傳短片。我哋首先政府建立個口號，希望咧就口號之後咧就有好嘅口碑嘅出現。就好嗱噉樣啦。誒，佢哋好盡力啦。啊，不如我都我自己就都講下啦。我排咗第二輪咧講。

538
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:40,810
嚇少少啦！誒誒，即係我第一我自己係仲裁員啦，即係過往幾年。但係第二咧就係調解咧，我就係即係最中意鼓勵調解。你哋未推廣，我哋已經叫你哋㗎啦。所以喺嗰個雷曼咧就有呢個金融調解中心，用金融調解呢個機制咧，的確係對市。

539
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,940
少即係弱少嗰一方。

540
01:52:43,220 --> 01:53:03,230
係好嘅，因為咧，通常我哋遇到嘅個案咧，就係你係大家嗰個財政嘅實力懸殊嘅時候咧，一定係有錢嗰方係要去打官司嗱。咁當然咧，喺家事最好用調解啦。打完官司就一定散曬冇機會。有啲調解咧可以恢復翻，我家都有。

541
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:11,080
我頭頭先好高興咧，你講司法嗰度咧都有少配合，就係話堂費嗰度盡量係鼓勵誒用調解啦。

542
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:31,370
誒，我哋即係即係喺強拍嘅時候咧，我哋喺呢度有討論過咧，即係個冇過到啦。嗰個我都係覺得係啱嘅方向，就係話其實有一啲類似強拍呢一類咧，係鼓勵而家就係鼓勵啦。其實即係一個叫做necessary procedure，你一定要經過一個調解咧，其實係對嗰個弱小個。

543
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:51,380
一方咧，其實係好事嚟嘅嚇。咁而其實對大家避免到打官司係最好啦。啊，大家一樣有錢嘅咪大家去打過啫嚇。但係你真係好多人係打唔起嗰個官司。咁所以咧，我自己就經經驗裏邊咧，就係喺民間嘅糾紛，包括樓宇管理嗰啲咧，如果係有好嘅。

544
01:53:51,380 --> 01:54:06,650
調解員啊，當然我自己都係法律界嘅，我自哋自己揾人幫手都係法律界背景多。但係咧，如果你係牽涉到金融啊，或者你嗰啲樓宇管理咧，如果有一啲其他由呢方面專行嘅調解員咧，其實係一個team噉樣做。

545
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:25,320
唔係一個因嘅，有時噉你會多啲機會咧，係達至成功。咁所以我都希望將呢個經驗同你哋分享翻咧。你哋要推廣嘅時候咧，你哋係可以考慮埋。即係我覺得民間我自己遇到，我通常都係勸啲人，啲街坊你唔好打，係打咧好慘嘅。

546
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:45,610
嚇，真係好慘㗎！小家庭去打官司啊，最後真係嚇家家都散埋嚇，破產都破埋，噉樣都唔夠律師費嚇。即係你話，所以咧呢一方面咧係要同佢哋講解，噉啊唔係純係個口號啦，口號係唔夠㗎嚇。真係用一啲實際嘅個案用個心咧去推廣呢樣嘢。

547
01:54:45,610 --> 01:55:05,620
喺法律界推廣多啲咯，嚇開頭法律界未必係咁咁buy呢一樣嘢咧，我覺得為咗社會咧係應該鼓勵多少少嘅嚇。噉我諗咧就誒，基於呢個大前提，我哋支持你啦。咁但係你哋應該係吳乃星議員有咩補充？我我提問題啊！啊，你想第二輪啊？唔係，我未提嘅。

548
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:07,100
啊！你咪誒？

549
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:28,770
誒，我第一輪嚟嘅。哦，頭先你第一輪舉咗手，啊，我畀阿吳靚星員問埋啦，我可以有個酌情權畀翻你問翻嘅。好，我就係第第八段裏邊咧，就好明顯睇到咧，就係最後一句咧，就係話而家即係要推廣嘅對象咧，就不限於乜乜咁之後咧。

550
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:48,780
就建造業啦、教育啦、家事啦、金融啦、保險啦和法律界都要提到法律界都要推推廣。咁咧依個第一根本上打親官司傾親嘅梗係經過法律界噉就係㗎啦。咁咧依個問題都仲要向佢推廣咧，都有少少笑話嘅。咁但係咧。

551
01:55:48,780 --> 01:56:08,790
咧就無論點樣啦，我就有另外嘅諗法，就係或者依個一般人一啲叫layman嘅諗法咧，就係會唔會佢哋直接利益嘅關係，所以佢哋唔好想你下下拎佢調解，不如等經我去代表你去法庭，仲好過啦噉。

552
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:20,710
因為依個係直接利益嚟㗎嘛，咁咁呢個你如果再同佢去推廣，遇唔遇到啲困難咧？咁嗱，依個咧就想聽一聽。第二個問題咧就係話。

553
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:28,980
就算喺嗰個小組委員會啊，叫公眾教育及宣傳小組委員會啊，我諗都應該加翻法律界嘅。

554
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:49,630
係嘛，同埋工程界有好多噉嘅濕濕碎碎成日裝修啊，乜乜Kクラ香港而家好多小維修、大維修都係牽涉工程界，呢度就冇提到好緊要嘅工程界嘅人嘅參與。係啊，咁咧第三咧，我就想問一問咧，就係話法援會唔會係用喺？

555
01:56:49,630 --> 01:57:09,640
調解嗰度咯，有冇得申請嘅咧？咁如果唔係嘅話咧，有啲咧就不如法律就猛咁嗱，法律律師方面即係法律界咧就一定招佢哋入嚟去法庭。點解你走去調解啊？我冇我冇得撈啦，收少咗好多咯。嗱呢啲咧，我係想呢個問題現實啲嘅都。

556
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,090
問。

557
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:30,380
好，卓專員，或者我我回答啊，吳議員第一個問題啦，就關於話即係誒會唔會好似誒影響到法律界嗰個直接利益嗰度啦？咁另外嗰兩條關於話嗰個誒教育及宣傳小組係咪應該加翻誒法律界、工程界啊，即係嗰個即係嗰個誒成員方面？

558
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:50,390
咧同埋話嗰個誒法援係咪可以即係做到呢個調解咧？我或者畀翻我哋專業同事答。咁誒嗰度關於話誒，即係譬如如果我係法律界噉，不如你我代表你好講啦，係嘛？咁調解做咩嘢咧？噉樣噉，但係咧，正如頭先阿賴專員講咧，噉係呢個喺二零零九年咧，其實就法院。

559
01:57:50,390 --> 01:58:10,400
咧係誒，頒佈咗呢個實務指示三十一調解咁調解而已經係一個民事訴訟一個一環嚟嘅。咁如果你唔去調解，你冒冒然乜嘢，你都就去打官司咧。其實喺第日嗰個即係法庭嗰個判決啊嗰度咧係即係即係係會考慮到呢一點嘅。咁所以呢一個咧，我相信係一個誒誒。

560
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:30,410
法律界需要考慮嘅一個嘅因素嚇，咁其他啲或者睇下阿賴生或者李生嚟回答。啊，多謝主席啊，補充先喺嗰個法律界，實上即係都明顯嘅，係早推行嘅早期嗰時，好似頭先唔唔，議員都誒睇睇都誒明白到，即係係有一部分嘅誒法律。

561
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:50,420
界人士係抗拒嘅喺度，所以啊，我哋喺法律界都係要推動嘅，就唔係話所有律師都啊，即係誒好完全噉樣支持呢個誒調解。噉啊，咩原因我哋明未未未必完全明白，但係都一定係一個推推行嘅對一個推推行呢個推廣呢個調解嘅對象噉樣。

562
01:58:50,420 --> 01:59:10,430
其他嗰兩個問題咧，就關於呢個我哋嗰個宣傳小組咧，實上係包括有法律界同埋工程界嘅人士喺度嘅。咁最深屘嗰個問題，關於呢個發緩嗰度咧，係佢誒誒涵蓋呢個誒調解嗰個工作嘅。嗯，即係可以根據係想調解去申請發緩。係佢包括發緩定係佢？

563
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:12,550
佢如果純粹想去調解，佢申請。

564
01:59:13,790 --> 01:59:17,090
定一定要訴訴訴訟中間調解咧？

565
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:37,380
主席，誒據我所知，就係如果佢申請調解，因為有官司，噉佢申請發悶嘅時候咧，其中一項佢可以若係係係包括在內嘅咧，就係調解嘅費用。噉，當然佢要係中間訴訟中嘅調解嚟講。嚇係嚇啊！即係話一開手調一開手選擇佢想講嚇。

566
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:57,390
唔能夠申請到法院咯，啫嘛？唔係啊啊啊啊！主主席噉啊，就根據法院嗰度咧，仍然係要第一佢兩兩個即係實有啲基本嘅條件。第一嗰個誒，佢嗰個誒財富嗰個嗰個誒審查啊，同埋嗰個本身個個案嘅審查。噉啊喺嗰個個案之中咧，如果係佢覺得係。

567
01:59:57,390 --> 02:00:17,400
即係有噉嘅需要調解或者進行呢個調解一個呢個呢個呢個程序咧，係發緩咧，係喺嗰個經費係包括咗呢個調解嗰個費用嘅。基本上，我諗佢暫時答咗你，佢你唔可以話佢唔選擇佢嗰個，佢係係係誒，佢批咗發緩之後，中間過程調解嗱，我哋咁啦，阿吳議員，我諗咧，你個問。

568
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:37,410
題非常之好，我哋喺法援嗰個section咧，我哋應該追問下法援嚇，就問下佢可唔可以噉啊慳翻我哋法援嗰啲係嘛？我知道你係諗緊咧，就係法援嘅經費能唔能夠係誒，亦都可以省減咧？如果我哋推廣咗呢一樣嘢之後係嘛？咁好啦，噉我諗咧就。

569
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:57,420
就啊！如果大家冇問題咧，首先我係好多謝好多謝律政司嘅代表啊，好多謝我哋啊吳亮星議員啊，去到最後頭先咧，其實啊劉慧卿議員啦都係去到最後今日咧，係冬至，祝大家冬至快樂噉，亦都咧多謝秘書處嘅同事堅守崗位。

570
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:03,180
到而家咁咧，我哋就新年之後見啦！嚇，祝大家聖誕快樂，新年進步。
