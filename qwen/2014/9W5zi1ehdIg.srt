1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
安。

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:21,450
本會現在恢復《合約第三者權利條例草案》二讀辯論，審議條例草案嘅委員會主席梁繼昌議員就委員會嘅報告向本會發言，梁議員。

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:33,670
先生，主席，在我擔任《議事委員會》關於《合約權益第三方法案》主席委員會主席的職務下，我報告《議事委員會》的討論。

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,000
法案委員會支持《的合同權或第三方法案》，簡稱《法案》。

5
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,780
which seeks to provide for the enforcement of contractual terms by third parties and related matters.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,890
委員會指出，這係應對香港律師公會提出之擔憂。

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,740
deeds of mutual covenants, DMCs。

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,040
are to be excluded from the application of the bill.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,170
因為律法relevant to building management and enforcement of rights under a DMC。

10
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:19,270
consist of a range of applicable legal provisions under the Building Management Ordinance, Chapter 344.

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,600
《The Conveyancing and Property Ordinance》第219章和《The Common Law》。

12
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:38,100
這些適用的法律原則，創造一個獨特且複雜的法律體係，which sets clear limits on the enforceability of land covenants.

13
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:55,140
The current legal regime for the enforcement of a DMC has, over the years, developed specifically in response to the needs of regulating the occupation and management of multi-storey buildings and estate developments in Hong Kong.

14
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:07,230
任何 change to the DMC regime will affect a large number of people, and it would be inappropriate for the bill to alter or relax the legal regime of DMC.

15
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,020
Without full consultation, specifically aimed at reform of this branch of the law.

16
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,920
to address the issue that a DMC may contain terms not relating to land.

17
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:28,410
The administration has proposed to amend clause three, sub-section two of the bill.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,160
所以，為咗釐清，所有條文喺一個DMC。

19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,180
作為一個契約，relating to land.

20
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,910
are to be excluded from the application of the bill.

21
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:52,860
法案委員會已就是否排除DMCs從法案適用範圍內，會使私人建築物的租客，

22
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,090
和使用者，Common Parts of Private Buildings。

23
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,770
Who are not owners of the private buildings, unable to rely on the bill, to enforce a term of the DMC.

24
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,850
According to the Department of Justice.

25
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,580
作為租客，私有建築物。

26
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,660
and users of common parts of private buildings, are not owners of

27
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,090
私人建築。

28
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,330
They are generally not entitled to bring an action under a DMC.

29
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:35,300
The exclusion of a DMC from the application of the bill does not act or diminish the rights under the DMC.

30
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,510
Neither does the exclusion preclude contracting parties.

31
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,400
If they so intend.

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,280
from from conferring an enforceable right of action.

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,220
Against a tenant.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,970
或一使用者， of the common parts of a private building.

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
所以，長，作為，要求。

36
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,750
Under other applicable laws, are complied with.

37
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,870
委員會主席：，委員會主席，先生，指出，一個第三方。

38
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:12,050
可以 presently seek to enforce a contract from the court through devices such as agency and trust.

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:24,070
Members of the Bills Committee have asked whether the rights of the third party to enforce a contract would be diminished following the implementation of the bill.

40
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:38,040
As clarified by the Department of Justice, the bill, if implemented, would provide a third party with an additional channel, which is more convenient, to enforce the contract.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,650
如果它是承諾方的意圖，允許第三方執行合約。

42
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,460
Mr. President.

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,540
The objective of the present reform is to confer rights on a third party.

44
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,790
rather than to derogate from them.

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:06,160
thus, the existing rights of a third party under statute law and at common law would not be affected after the implementation of the bill.

46
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,960
on the implementation arrangements.

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,490
The administration has been asked to step up publicity efforts in the promotion of the new legislative regime.

48
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,930
with a view to assisting the general public and various stakeholders in preparing for the implementation of the bill.

49
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,060
In response to members' suggestions.

50
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,410
The administration has advised that it would liaise closely with the legal professional bodies in this regard.

51
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:46,650
The administration also agreed to consider the feasibility of bringing the new legislative regime into operation one year after the passage of the bill.

52
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,950
Next, Mr. President, I would like to give my personal views on this bill.

53
00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:05,480
Mr. President, the doctrine of privy of contract provides that a person who is not a party to a contract cannot acquire any rights under that contract.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,540
或被subject to any of his burden。

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,770
this remains the general rules in Hong Kong law.

56
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,620
The fact that a third-party beneficiary of a contract.

57
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,290
Could not enforce the contractual benefits in his favour, was generally regarded as unsatisfactory.

58
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:33,670
and indeed, a number of devices were developed in the past in order to circumvent this aspect of privy doctrine.

59
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,870
In addition, a number of exceptions.

60
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,820
were developed where third-party rights were recognised.

61
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,610
這些devices and exceptions，可以 artificial and complex。

62
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,200
所以，那有理由為改革第三方受益人制度。

63
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,190
這些 devise,s and exceptions remain, despite the enactment of the bill.

64
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,840
The bill follows the major contents and direction of the English contracts.

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,550
In bracket, Rights of Third Party Act, 1999.

66
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,440
very generally speaking.

67
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:22,020
The bill allows a third party to a contract the right of enforcement, provided that either limb of a two-limbs test is satisfied.

68
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,890
First, either that a third party may enforce the contract.

69
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,090
If the contract contains an express term to that effect.

70
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,500
或。

71
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,950
If the contract contains a term which purports to confer a benefit on a third party,

72
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,070
那 party may enforce that term， unless on a proper construction of the contract.

73
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,960
The parties to the contract do not intend the third party may do so.

74
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,420
先生，我支持通過該法案。

75
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:07,310
Indeed, I think the bill should come at an earlier date, so that Hong Kong's contract law system can be more in line with that of most other common law jurisdictions.

76
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,850
There are three types of contracts which I would like to mention here.

77
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,960
這些係合同，which would have more bearings on the daily lives of the citizens of Hong Kong.

78
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,150
第一，合同規管的關係之間，僱主和僱員。

79
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,370
先生，條法案唔會alter啲合約協議，訂立喺之間嘅僱主同僱員。

80
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,450
在的，能力，或，對，一，份，就業，契約。

81
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,150
然而，the bill contains a provision under clause three, subsection four.

82
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:54,840
要 prohibit a third party from enforcing a term of employment against an employee by a third party.

83
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,490
This provision does not apply to an employer.

84
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:08,360
In simple terms, a third party may still be able to enforce a term of an employment contract against an employer.

85
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,170
Provided conditions of the enforceability requirement in the bill are satisfied.

86
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,510
這條款給更多保護給一個員工。

87
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,590
Who is often seen as the party with the weaker bargaining power in an employment relationship?

88
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,870
第二，我亦都Concerned about consumer rights in a consumer contract.

89
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,700
The honourable Dennis Quaid raised a question in the 7 May 2014 Bills Committee meeting.

90
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,940
essentially， the requirement of the enforceability test under Clause 4 of the bill.

91
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:55,770
which I have highlighted about, above will not enable consumers to have direct and convenient remedies for damages.

92
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,860
injury or loss suffered due to a breach of a contract.

93
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,750
to which he was not a party to.

94
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,860
呢個觀點確實係由消費者諮詢委員會所分享。

95
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:17,960
政府在應對此關切時，明確表示，政府與法律改革委員會共識。

96
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,780
and considered that it is more appropriate to give effect.

97
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,610
to the contracting parties' intention.

98
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,960
whether to confer legally enforceable right on a third party.

99
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,950
This response, I believe, is not satisfactory.

100
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,120
And I would urge the government to review this aspect of the bill at an appropriate time.

101
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,050
now，indeed，would，the，government，let，me，know。

102
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:56,930
The redress and remedies a consumer can obtain if he is injured by a faulty product as a consumer, but nonetheless he is not a party to a consumer contract.

103
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,770
我認為任何聲稱都可以進行。

104
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,090
Under a tortious claim hat.

105
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,470
或，個 statutory claim under any product liability legislation.

106
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,450
但我會非常 grateful if the government can confirm that point.

107
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:24,800
Third, it is important to note that insurance contract is not excluded from the bill, so it would be possible for parties to an insurance contract.

108
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,690
to exclude the operation of the bill in the contract.

109
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,180
Through proper construction of the policy wording, if the party so intended.

110
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,350
在contest of insurance contracts.

111
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,160
我因此關心，這項保險的對象。

112
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,570
Who may not be a party to insurance contract? Maybe he is not paying the premium.

113
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,590
may not be able to enforce such a contract.

114
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,980
在terms of the complexity and technical nature of the bill.

115
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,910
and the fact that normal citizens and consumers in general will be affected by the bill.

116
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:15,870
我會勸促政府，和 indeed律師公會，要投入足夠的資源和時間，去教育公眾，關於法案的影響力，於法案通過之前。

117
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,510
And I would like the government to give an undertaking in this council to do so.

118
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,000
last, on behalf of my constituents.

119
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,850
我會要求政府明確地釐清法案對企業文件的影響。

120
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:40,620
The first type of document I'm concerned about is the constitutive documents of a Hong Kong incorporated company.

121
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,880
I.E. the memorandum of association under the new companies ordinance.

122
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:55,390
現在，什麼是該法案對傳統上只綁束股東和公司的憲法文件的影響？

123
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,420
and secondly.

124
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:07,290
what is the effect of the bill on any public offer documents for shares or securities offered to the public?

125
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,330
under the companies ordinance.

126
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,440
所有的 Securities and Futures Ordinance。

127
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:22,030
the proper construction of the second question, I believe, of any public who subscribes for shares or securities.

128
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,300
Under public order document.

129
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,310
should be a party to a contract.

130
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,880
而The terms of the public offer document would become the terms of the subscription.

131
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,440
Therefore，those subscribers are not third party to such a subscription contract.

132
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,250
任何 purported exclusion clause drafted under the bill will have no effect on the subscribers.

133
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,030
Please, will the government confirm that my understanding is correct here?

134
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,660
主席。

135
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:08,850
subject to my above comments, I support, and would urge my honouring members of the council from across the political parties to support the resumption of the second reading and the passage of the bill. Thank you, Mr. President.有冇其他議員想發言？

136
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,130
李慧瓊業。

137
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:33,730
主席，本條例草案係喺香港合約法嘅框架底下引入讓第三者強制執行授予佢嘅權利，呢個做法係打破咗過去唔係合約一方就唔能夠根據合約而取得強制執行權。

138
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:42,890
按照過往嘅原則，合約各方就算想令第三者受惠，除非第三者係藉助代理或者信託等法律原則。

139
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:52,020
去協助執行，誒，否則咧，若然係無法執行咧，喺現行嘅合約法框架底下咧，亦都不能夠落實。

140
00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:08,060
所以咧，經常畀人批評咧，係會作出一啲令人牽強嘅決定，而且亦都違背咗合約各方咧要令第三者受惠嘅意願。喺某種情況底下咧，第三者為咗強制執行有關嘅權利咧，就需要用。

141
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:28,390
大量分開訂立嘅合約，等等呢啲形式咧，去執行招致額外嘅費用，造成複雜同埋不便。主席面對呢個不理想嘅情況咧，好多嘅普通法嘅司法管轄區已經通過立法改革呢個原則。呢啲司法管轄區咧，包括澳大利亞、加拿大、英。

142
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:48,400
英國、新西蘭同埋新加坡，主席民建聯咧係支持法改會多年前發表嘅《納約各方嘅相互關係報告書》，建議透過詳細嘅立法機制改革目前《納約各方相互關係原則》，亦都支持通過本條例草案去落實法改會嘅建議，以改善香港合。

143
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,560
約法制度，以使制度能夠與其他主要普通法司法管轄區做法看齊。

144
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:15,070
主席，追本溯源，立法各方嘅相互關係報告書早喺二零零五年九月已經發表，但係由建議到立法到生效，前後差不多經歷咧十年。呢個咧再次説明香港喺唔同嘅範疇嘅發展咧，都係以龜速前進。呢個情況咧，絕對係一個警號。

145
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:31,670
為咗提升香港嘅競爭能力，去喺唔同層面上競爭能力咧，特區政府咧必須檢視每個環節，點對點諗諗咧點樣可以加快完善咧法規嘅程序。主席用讓第三者強制執行授予佢嘅權力，第一步。

146
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:51,960
呢一步咧，香港雖然走得好慢、好細，英國咧喺一九九九年咧已經引入合約第三者權利法例，但係無論如何，作為第一步咧，今次嘅修訂係參考咗英國同埋其他國家落實相關法例後嘅案例，平衡咗合約方嘅意願同埋第三者嘅權益，亦都合，亦都。

147
00:16:51,960 --> 00:17:11,970
考慮咗香港一啲獨特性，包括咗土地契約。誒喺而家嘅安排底下咧，係獲得豁免。誒法例亦都安排咗另一啲嘅豁免，包括匯票啦、提單啦、信用狀、公司章程，針對僱員嘅僱傭合約條款等等。而第三者咧必須符合兩項檢驗嘅其中一項咧。

148
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,710
先至能夠係誒強制執行。

149
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:36,000
畀佢嘅權益噉，第一就係合約本身已經規定咗第三者可以強制執行。第二就係合約有賦予第三者相關權益嘅條件。若然合約本身冇容許第三者執行嘅意圖咧，第三者咧就不能透過相關嘅法例咧要求強制執行。呢兩項檢驗咧都係保障合約雙方。

150
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:56,010
令到咧法例嘅改革唔會令到合約方咧係引致無法估計嘅訴訟風險，亦都唔讓香港走向一個咧動接訴訟嘅社會。不過有利都有弊，呢個安排咧對於一啲度身訂造合約各方實力均等下簽訂嘅合約咧，都係一個合理嘅安排。不過訴訟門檻。

151
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:16,020
相對高咧，對簽約時議價能力低嘅一方咧係不利嘅。議價能力弱啲嘅方咧，我哋通常諗到就係消費者啦。頭先阿梁議員都有提過啦，大家都好清楚知道，其實好多嘅合約咧係由服務供應商啊已經係寫好，消費者簽約過程裏邊咧其實係冇太大。

152
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:36,030
大嘅修改空間嘅呢個問題咧，消委會其實都留意到嘅，所以喺佢嘅意見書亦都指出咗，即使引入條例草案咧，對於改善消費者作為合約第三方嘅權益咧，亦都冇實質太大嘅幫助。消委會因此建議咧，將上述兩項檢驗略為放寬，容讓消費者。

153
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:56,040
較容易作為第三者提出訴訟，以補充現時冇綜合保障消費者嘅條例。當然啦，法改會指保障消費者權益唔應該透過呢個條例落實，而條例草案根本嘅原則咧就係要尊重合約方嘅自由。若然按消委會嘅意見放寬咧，就違反咗立約自由嘅原則。

154
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,370
係。

155
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:16,660
主席，我認為啊呢個講法咧就啊納約自由呢個原則，如果放棄一啲度身訂造嘅合約，雙方議價能力相約嘅情況底下咧，都係非常合理嘅。但係正如我頭先講啦，睇翻好多誒合約嘅訂立咧，其實誒無論係喺資訊啦、技術啦，以至

156
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,440
至係知識方面咧，嗯。

157
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:39,890
合約方咧都未必處於一個均等嘅狀況，噉我哋隨便舉啲例子都會揾到嘅，例如消費者同銀行啊或者保險公司簽嘅合約，啊事實上雙方喺資訊技術同埋知識上咧係唔係完全嘅對等嘅。喺呢個考慮底下咧，如果降低消費者作為第三者強制執行嘅門檻，

158
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:59,900
咧，亦都係一種平衡。主席，我雖然明白咧呢個階段咧，當局係唔會考慮嘅。作為引入合約第三者權利條例草案嘅起步，我係支持，亦都明白呢個做法咧會更加讓社會各方接受。但係咧，我請當局咧就唔好啊，唔理解現實啊簽約嘅過程裏邊咧，確實有不少合約嘅。

159
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:18,720
定立合約方或者各方嗰個啊，無論喺資訊啦、技術同埋知識上咧，係有不均等嘅情況嘅。噉我誒民建聯咧係要求當局咧繼續監察本條例草案落實嘅情況喺下一輪檢討時候提出相關嘅修訂。本人僅此陳辭支持條例草案。

160
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,670
有冇其他嘢想發言？

161
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,360
如果冇，我現在就請律政司司長發言答辯。喺司長答辯之後，辯論即告結束。律政司司長。

162
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:50,650
主席，我喺今年三月向立法會提交《合約第三者權利條例草案》，由梁繼昌議員擔任主席嘅法案委員會已經係詳細審閲該條條例草案。我僅此衷心感謝梁繼昌議員、各法案委員會委員同埋有關團體。

163
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,200
嘅寶貴意見。

164
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:12,490
正如我響提交條例草案嘅時候指出，條例草案嘅目的係落實香港法律改革委員會響二零零五年九月發表嘅納約各方嘅相互關係報告書中有關改革普通法下合約各方相互關係原則嘅建議。

165
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:32,500
根據普通法嘅相互關係原則，非合約一方嘅人士簡稱第三者，唔能夠根據合約而取得或者係強制執行合約下邊嘅權利。呢一個原則往往令到合約各方唔能夠實現，令到第三者受惠嘅意願，引致。

166
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:41,300
致對受引致對第三者權利造成唔公平或者唔方便嘅情況，因此一直係受到批評。

167
00:21:41,610 --> 00:22:01,620
條例草案容許合約各方按其意願賦予第三者可強制執行嘅合約權利。簡而言之，假如合約各方嘅用意係容許第三者可強制執行合約，則條例草案可以落實合約。

168
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:10,140
各方嘅意願，為第三者提供更直接嘅法律途徑，強制執行合約。

169
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:18,770
若果合約各方係唔希望條例草案嘅條文適用於合約，亦都可以喺合約裏邊定明。

170
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:37,910
條例草案唔單止能夠進一步完善香港嘅合約法制度，亦都可以令香港嘅合約法同其他嘅主要普通法司法管轄區，包括英國、澳洲同埋新西蘭等嘅有關法律看齊。

171
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:58,860
稍後我會動議兩項嘅委員會審議階段修正案，呢啲嘅修正案全部係獲法案委員會同意。我現作簡單嘅介紹條例草案第三括弧二條定明新嘅法律規定係唔會適用於某啲類。

172
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:18,870
類別嘅合約，其中一類嘅合約係關乎土地嘅契約，包括公契。但係由於公契可能再有並非關乎土地嘅條款，因此我哋建議修訂條例草案第三括弧二條，以明確將公約中所

173
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:28,320
所有嘅條款以及關乎土地嘅契約列入條例草案不適用嘅合約類別範圍。

174
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:39,810
此外，我哋係建議對條例草案英文第八括弧二嘅條稍微修訂，務求可以完善呢一條嘅表達方式。

175
00:23:40,090 --> 00:24:00,100
主席，正如我剛才指出，若果條例草案獲得通過，將會有助完善香港嘅合約法；而修訂建議則可以進一步完善條例草案嘅內容。我僅此陳詞，懇請議員支持二讀合約第三者。

176
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,660
權力條例草案以及我哋稍後動議嘅各項修正案，多謝主席。

177
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:16,470
我現在向各位提出嘅代決議題係《合約第三者權利條例草案》予以議讀，現在鼓勵表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

178
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,010
反對嘅請舉手。

179
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:29,700
我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。合約第三者權利條例草案。

180
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,080
全體委員會審議階段，本會現在成委。
