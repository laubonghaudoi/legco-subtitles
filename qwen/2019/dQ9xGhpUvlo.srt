57
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:27,810

on the ninth of December.

63
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,650
我們也正在準備為第58屆威尼斯雙年展香港館的展示。

64
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:14,610
again，very much part of an M plus voice，how we work across disciplines of design and architecture，moving image and visual art。

65
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:12,340
東亞展覽，我們做一個名為《東南亞動畫混音》的節目，看導演來自柬埔寨、印尼、馬來西亞、菲律賓、新加坡、泰國和越南。

66
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:44,940
collaboration that MPlus undertakes with the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, and we were very privileged to be working with Samson Young and Ying Kwok, the curator, to represent his work for Hong Kong audiences.

67
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:53,430
發展在 cinema 呈現，where we work with musicians and artists to engage in expanding the dimension of what cinema might be in the twenty-first century.

68
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:18,940
as as mentioned previously with Samson Young, this is the fourth time that we are partnering with Hong Kong Arts Development Council to present Shirley Tsai, who is Los Angeles-based Hong Kong artist.

69
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:38,540
一 close collaboration with Hong Kong ADC in the selection of this artist, coming via the curator Christina Lee. It was a very important conversation to undertake with ADC and a unanimous decision on both sides.

70
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:16,580
關於社區參與，呃，兩個終點，一個是We Dance，這個是跟Free Space Happening一起主辦的，呃，跟不同的亞洲，今年的主題是亞洲舞蹈，我們請不同的國家的亞洲舞蹈家來香港，跟本地的舞蹈家和學生合作交流。

71
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:39,690
然後最後介紹，呃，大家我們C九幺零幺係列，這是我們，呃，免費的，呃，課程都歡迎，呃，所有的人可以來更深入的學習各個藝術門類，包括戲曲、舞蹈、話劇，還有舞，呃，舞美製作等等。

72
00:12:50,590 --> 00:13:10,600
Okay, thank you. Very nice to be beginning two thousand and nineteen, talking about the achievements of M Plus as part of the district. And I will begin with audience building, because as we all know, a museum is far more than just a building. It is of course a relationship between our audiences and.

73
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:30,610
what and our ideas. Last year we did three major exhibitions. The third one still continuing. The first was Samson Young Songs for Disaster Relief World Tour. This was the return exhibition of the very successful presentation of Samson Young in Venice Biennale.

74
00:13:45,220 --> 00:14:05,230
The second exhibition was titled In Search of Southeast Asia through the M Plus Collections, and for the first time, we presented to Hong Kong audiences our thinking and our collection building in relation to Southeast Asia, a region, a geographical region for us, and it was.

75
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:34,900
extremely successful again with great critical responses for this exhibition. The third, titled Naguchi for Jan Vow Counterpoint, is the first time that we've worked with two singular artists, and working with major international partner.

76
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:54,970
Naguchi Foundation and Museum in New York to bring major loans to Hong Kong. Again, a very successful start for us, and as you can see, numbers climbing. And this on the back of M+ topping out at the end of November, which is such a landmark moment.

77
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:17,580
其他 aspect of our work, of course, include live art. We, as Alison mentioned, we work very closely with our colleagues in the performing arts department to see where we can intersect our interests. And our first was a live art presentation over a period.

78
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,230
Think about museum learning programmes.

79
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,800
新 museum that opened in Abu Dhabi was

80
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,840
museological exploration of mid-twentieth-century art.

81
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:33,410
museum， and we had a extremely interesting symposium called looking at these ideas of art and design.

82
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:05,070
moment to profile M Plus's interests in and in relation to our building progress, our collections and our programmes. Great audience reception as well.

83
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:23,170
with the support of the Design Trust and is awarded to strengthen points of research and thinking around design and architecture in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region.

84
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:31,540
極為 interesting， with a conversation after his major lecture presentation about the design by Jean Nouvel and then what it means to open a new museum in the 21st century.

85
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:38,800
We also announced the Sig Prize at the end of last year, a major launch for us, which recognises outstanding artistic practice in the Greater China region, and this prize.

86
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:37,590
of for three days with 720 participants coming to that. The other live arts that we presented was in relation to cinema and film, and this was called haunting haunting images live art cinema by Lim Gyeong. Again, a major

87
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:59,280
Audience building, of course, continues in other forms, such as R.M. Plus screenings. Over last year, we did three presentations. The first, looking at French and Hong Kong cinema through a programme called Beneath the Pavement. The second presentation was in relation to the Southeast.

88
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:32,630
And then finally, a very important solo presentation of the seminal Hong Kong filmmaker Ann Hui, called Face to Face, the film Life of Ann Hui. And we also did an important seminar with Ann Hui called Face to Face.

89
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:55,960
Our audience building also includes working with lectures and symposia formats and public workshops across the year. And last year we did a group of these, beginning with M Plus Matters: Post One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty Nine Visual and Material Culture in China. Very important.

90
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:22,820
We also then moved into the twenty-first century very definitely with M Plus matters art and design in the digital realm. Very important aspect of what we do. Digital culture is absolutely integral to M Plus and our vision, especially as a twenty-first century.

91
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:54,760
Lastly, but not least, to intersect with the business of Design Week, M Plus also presents a keynote, and we invited Manuel Rabate, the director of the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Knowing as we at Westkauwloon build major cultural infrastructure, to learn from.

92
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:14,770
international colleagues is always a great experience and to share publicly what that learning is is something that we really encourage and seek to enhance Hong Kong's cultural capital. So to have Manuel Rabate here to talk about this major new

93
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,200
Our future.

94
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,430
very important part of

95
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,250
as we prepare for opening of the museum next year.

96
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,200
最著視覺藝術國際平台 in the world.

97
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,590
confident working with them that the future of the museum is in good hands.

98
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,190
Audience building. Duncan, I have to ask your team to speed up on the presentation. Okay, I'm almost finished.

99
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:46,310
continues to expand the work of the Chinese Contemporary Art Award, which has been going for the last twenty years.

100
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:24,170
We have an alumni of 400 youngsters, and I should add that one of those young people has returned back as one of our interns this year.

101
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:07,960
Our own M Plus docent program. It's a volunteer program, and we have recruited now over a hundred docents in preparation for the museum opening.

102
00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:03,700
Our internship programs are as important. We we see this as an essential part of the work that we do because these these interns are the future of our museum capacity.

103
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:52,490
Audience building also continued at Art Basel Hong Kong last year, and Plus commissioned a special booth at what is really a very important international connection vis-à-vis Hong Kong's cultural infrastructure development. So it's a great.

104
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:26,330
Audience building continues in relation to our own thinking around museum learning programmes, and we have developed a series of lectures called Open Up, Museum Learning in the Twenty-First Century. A series of talks that were that are aimed really at our.

105
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:46,340
And training, but we've opened up to the public and our colleagues across the museum sector in Hong Kong. Extremely well attended, every single lecture is fully subscribed, and we bring major speakers from all over the world to discuss what does it mean to

106
00:20:49,960 --> 00:21:09,970
Capacity building, of course, a central part of what we do. Working with colleagues and collaborators to develop programmes. The M Plus Design Trust Research Fellowship is one such programme. It's an annual research grant that we deliver.

107
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:24,040
this year we expanded our internship program to ten interns working with us for an entire year across different professional disciplines in the museum. they're an incredibly energetic and highly engaged group of youngsters, and I feel so

108
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:51,050
We also expand that that internship program to the Venice Biennale again, working with the Hong Kong Arts Development Council to deliver a program of 12 interns working over the period of six months at Venice to learn about what it means to be in the most prestigious.

109
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:28,250
Co-volunteers who do exhibition tours to schools and the broader audience, and our docents provide these tours in three languages: in Cantonese, in Mandarin, and in English. This is again a very important part of our capacity building.

110
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,130
啊！

111
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,020
西九文化區。

112
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:25,310
好高層次文化藝術什麼咁嚇，咁而第二咧就係我啱收到一個誒投訴。

113
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:25,970
We've had young people up in Beijing, and this programme will be reported in more detail next year.

114
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:56,390
嘅文化軟件發展咧，就介紹咗嘅。噉啊，而家咧就係啊，議員發問嘅時間嘅。噉啊。

115
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:54,950
issue really is, are they going to be attracted to a district that's not really yet ready for operation? We're gradually opening. Not ready. Of course not. We're gradually opening the facilities. We have the CITU centre.

116
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:40,720
You said you had three persons making presentations, including yourself. That's that was it. Okay, good, thank you. So首先咧就誒多謝幾位就住依個。

117
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:22,360
申請你會唔會鼓勵佢哋申請？首先，如果嚟申請，係咪真係亦都可以批到嘅呢？咁大家就唔需要喺市區嗰度啊，即係有呢一類嘅啊，有人認為係滋擾嘅表演咯，唔該，邊位回應？

118
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:53,780
公共、社區和青年 engagement， again a very essential part of how we think about the future, the future museum for Hong Kong and the future audiences for Hong Kong, and and frankly the future cultural interest for Hong Kong as we move.

119
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:13,790
move forward. There are clearly vocational interests here that we want to encourage, but also a greater sense of joy and learning when we look at creative capital in this city. Once again, we did the M+ summer camp. This is our fourth, and now

120
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:58,180
Yes, so right. So we we we have already gotten your presentation paper. So if you could just wrap it up. Wrap it up. Okay, we've got our rover, the creating stu the creative studio, and finally my last slide is to say that we've launched our first major access.

121
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:18,190
ability program for students in special schools. This is again an essential part of museum building. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I can just add, obviously the missing element is the Hong Kong Palace Museum. The focus this year has been on recruitment, and that's progressing. But in parallel to that, we've been working with the Palace Museum.

122
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:17,360
因為我哋今日有兩個項目嘅，咁另外一個項目咧就係啊有關西九文化區二區嘅最新發展嘅。咁如果係有關嗰個部分嗰啲咧，我哋稍後先至啊討論。噉啊，而家就有四位報咗名嘅，第一位就係毛孟靜議員，跟住就係謝偉。

123
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:37,370
全議員馬逢國議員同埋黃碧雲議員就每位四分鐘連問連答啦。咁首先請毛孟靜議員。誒唔該主持人。Now I I thank the presentations just now, but the previous one was quite unnecessarily done in Putonghua. This is Hong Kong.

124
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,150
咁所以喺呢度咧，其實係誒。

125
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,800
同埋，亦都係可以有各類。

126
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,820
Actually, try to apply. Of course, if they register.

127
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,210
We have no objection to that. Oh, that's good. No, that's all I want to know. Thank you.

128
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,860
誒多謝主席。噉啊，當然誒西九文化區咧呢個發展項目咧，其實～

129
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:10,690
誒呢方面嘅啊文化好緊要啦，係嘛？我哋唔可以針對某一類淨係擺喺度。咁呢度係我非常欣賞，亦都好多謝頭先咧，就係誒就誒西九最新一啲誒。

130
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:57,580
We stick to, we tend to at least stick to English, and then Cantonese. Thank you very much. It sounded all rather forced as a result。我想問嘅問題咧，就係啊，你哋嗰個街頭娛樂表演嘅許可證咧，就發出咗三百個，但三。

131
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:17,590
三百個聽落好少啦，係嘛？係誒，即係一年一誒，一年三百六十五日，一日一個都唔夠嘅。我就想問清楚係咪批得好嚴謹嘅咧？因為你基本上係講街頭娛樂表演嘅許可證，有娛樂兩個字就唔一定話即係要好。

132
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:45,940
自從旺角行人專用區殺街之後咧，嗰度好多嘅街頭表演咧就周到而施啦嚇。其中一個點咧，而家就係我哋新嘅中環碼頭，我哋摩天輪嗰度啊啊就啊話有大媽佢誒嗰個投訴就話入侵誒中環碼頭。

133
00:27:45,940 --> 00:28:05,950
我唔用入侵呢字眼啦，佢哋就喺嗰度佔據係表演，但係佢哋基本上咧係誒要求收錢嘅。我就想問喺西九文化區呢咁大個區，你可唔可以容納到？尤其是啊，即係嗰度冇民居啦，你有音樂啊等等都唔會滋擾嘅。如果佢哋嚟新

134
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:42,650
I'll deal with this one. We have a very very simple permit system. We just want to know that they can do what they claim they can do safely. So if someone comes to us and says they can juggle knives, they've got to do it safely. It's basically that perception. We don't restrict the numbers. If we had four or five hundred more, we'd be very happy. The issue

135
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:16,140
Now I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking about. This what's called in English simple translation Dharma performances. Usually at squares. Some people like them, some don't. It's a matter of opinion. Never mind. But then they should be allowed if they.

136
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:47,380
第二啊，未去第二位之前咧，我都想講講，我哋香港咧係用兩文三語嘅，所以我哋任何嘅官員或者係啊社團代表啊，包括西九嘅代表，我哋係歡迎你用啊兩言兩言三。

137
00:29:47,380 --> 00:30:07,390
三語兩文三語，任何一種，所以我哋亦都係有即時嘅傳譯。你用普通話、英文或者廣東話咧，我哋都有即時傳譯㗎。咁所以你哋隨便可以用任何一個誒兩文三語裏邊嘅語言嘅。咁跟住落嚟係請謝偉全議員。

138
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:34,150
我諗香港好多市民都期待嘅，因為擺咗咁多錢咧，亦都講咗咁耐咧。咁喺呢方面咧加快，同埋香港作為一個國際城市咧，當然咧喺即係我哋，尤其是講到文化藝術，我哋係包容，即係各方面都有，即係包括咧，即係誒呢個好似頭先主席講啦，即係我哋喺。

139
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,350
嗯。

140
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,880
thank you.

141
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,600
誒，多謝主席。

142
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,040
誒，跟住馬逢國議員。

143
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,760
And the design will be unveiled next month. So we are taking that point.

144
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,690
特區政府那個投入的資源呢，可以説是前所未有的，拿到國際上來説呢，也是非常大的。

145
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:12,350
誒，我曾經是四九的那個管理局的董事，十年到去年十一月三十號，我就誒任滿了。

146
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:38,420
啊，今天反而我就覺得很簡單啦，我是純粹是回歸一個民意代表，一個業界的代表，所以呢，我很多呢就感覺呢可以很自由的去問啊，沒有什麼顧慮。

147
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:26,050
呃，之前呢，我一直還是這個委員會的成員，但是我自己覺得是非常的尷尬，因為我不能在這裡呢問很多關於細節的事。理論上我是董事，我應該很清楚，所以呢，我是從來都不問問題的。

148
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:30,610
嗰個誒令到年青人有興趣嘅時候，喺呢方面咧，譬如簡單完一啲遮陰嘅地方啊、台台凳凳啊、誒坐嘅地方啊，就算啲照明燈啊，喺呢方面有冇機會或者推動畀年青人有創意同埋佢喺個設計方面有機會咧？唔該。

149
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:56,880
啊，一，是我做了那個西九的十年的董事呢，啊，一直我都想推動一個事情，就是希望呢西九管理局，啊，對香港，就是整個區呢，對香港的那個文化藝術的發展，扮演一個很重要很重要的角色，因為我們呢。

150
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:54,160
喺議會都好清楚，即係發言啊，或者講嘅時候咧，就係用咩語言。其實咧都係一個表達，即係我哋唔可以針對某類噉。亦都我都感謝咧，即係其實誒西九誒文化誒管理局咧，即係喺呢方面咧，亦都係採取畀我感覺喺呢方面係包容。

151
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:30,980
誒節目或者發展啊等等，可以畀到我哋一啲誒，即係好簡單嘅彙報呢方面嘅。咁誒，我睇到咧，其實喺嗰個人才培育嚇拓展觀眾非常重要啦。喺呢方面，令到多啲人喺即係呢方面咧，即係發揮到西九文化區。

152
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:50,990
即係帶嚟嘅呢方面，畀市民同埋大眾呢方面嘅一種，你覺得享受又得，或者個欣賞又得，或者個誒誒參與知識又好。咁所以呢度嚟講咧，其實係誒，我覺得係誒好嘅。就另外咧，就喺嗰個，我覺得頭先介紹亦都喺嗰。

153
00:31:50,990 --> 00:32:11,000
個軟件好嗰個推動咧，藝術同文專業發展咧，甚至即係喺將來管理或者管治方面咧，其實喺呢方面咧，其實都係重要嘅，因為一個誒，頭先我講啦，呢個文化區擺咁多錢啊，即係幾誒數以千億啦，即係可以講我分分鐘成千億。

154
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:33,440
我希望咧都喺嗰個考慮嘅時候可以多一啲。噉我哋軟件硬件都有有呢方面，所以我向來過去主席我都強調嘅。誒，就算軟件硬件方面，都希望突顯到咧呢個係西九文化區有文化藝術方面嘅呢啲表達出嚟。咁好耐以前都已經講過上一屆。

155
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:53,450
都講即係，就算嗰啲連係嗰啲隧道好，甚至而家今日嚟講，我天橋嚟講，我覺得即係都係行人天橋嚟講，我支持係有啲特別嘅呢方面嘅，即係呢方面嘅設計啊。咁當然即係誒用幾多錢咧，唔係一定係我成日強調，唔係一定係。

156
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:13,460
用多啲錢一定得到好嘅結果。有陣時咧就係可以用一啲誒合理嘅價錢做出相當好嘅效果。噉啊，呢度咧我又想問下西九誒管理嗰方面咧，即係因為點解咧成個西九文化區咧裏邊亦都有唔同嘅設施，其中有啲藝術公園。咁其實喺

157
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:51,570
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, in fact, obviously the art park itself is an integrated design. We have one of the world's leading park designers that have come in to design this, so all of those features are already integral within the design of the park. However, the idea of engaging young.

158
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,910
建。

159
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,720
兩百五十億。

160
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,040
政府文化資源的一半。

161
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,430
啊，多謝。

162
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,550
所以加起來，如果算地價的話，就肯定不止一千億。

163
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:05,570
到底對香港未來的那個文化藝術的，大家的理解是如何理解的？

164
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:24,630
怎麼利用這個資源？大家怎麼掌握利用你手裏的資源，來為香港的文化藝術，來推動、來發展？

165
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:14,160
我一直都説這是一個遷移工程，可能有人不同意。現在呢，我們那個地户馬上就出來了，又要重新嚟立法會拿錢，就申請錢。

166
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:15,510
超過一半，甚至於説，啊，可以動用的，因為那個LCSD，它有圖書館啦，還有其他的那個設施，所以C九是掌握了幾乎是一半的那個資源。

167
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:49,880
大家的不同的角色是在哪裏？共同點在哪裏？如何能夠互相配合？未來是大家怎麼理解那個工作的分工？呃，這裏那個報告。

168
00:37:50,160 --> 00:38:02,530
簡單介紹了很多已經在做的工作，我覺得很好，有一些是，這也也有很大的成績，但是我們要看，就是我們投入那麼多的資源，大家手裡面掌握了幾乎是香港。

169
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:18,480
一個是願景，整個C九這個是這個工程啊建成以後，馬上第一個已經出來了，它對香港的未來的文化願景是怎麼樣呢？大家怎麼理解呢？這是第一個問題。

170
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:32,420
我們很多年前給了兩百一十六億，加起來已經快五百億了。那累累到今天的那個價值已經超過了。另外，我們把那個可以作為商業酒店、啊辦公室的那個發展的的權益，也重新注到西九。

171
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:38,380
第二個問題呢？具體工作的時候，他跟很多我們香港的那個搞文化的機構，特別是跟政府有關的，啊，包括那個L C S D，包括那個呃A D C藝術發展局，還有比如説那個演藝學院，都是最主要的那個、那個、呃、呃、那個機構吧。

172
00:33:51,570 --> 00:34:11,580
people in refining and developing is something that we are looking at. Absolutely, not necessarily to look at benches or trellises or what have you, but other elements that would enhance the attractiveness of the park. So I accept that point entirely. Something we are looking at.哦，希望呢度可以多畀機會本地尤其是本。

173
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:31,590
本地嘅設計喺呢方面，唔該。Yeah, in fact, could I just say that we will be opening in next month, free space probably the temporary pavilion, which was designed by local designers as a result of a competition. We had over four hundred design groups, architectural groups, all local that competed.

174
00:34:41,880 --> 00:35:01,890
誒，我準備用普通話發言，誒誒，因為我準備用普通話發言，因為有兩位，誒，我覺得用普通話，這可能更簡單一點，因為我們這裡咧有零一二三，三就是普通話。剛才我們有同事呢，説普通話就不應該，我覺得不應該這樣子的，所以我還是用普通話來説，更好的溝通。

175
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:58,210
用國際的標準來説，不是一個少的數。但是我一直想問一個問題呢，特別是今天三位準備都負責我們那個細酒的軟件的那個工作的那個呃那個高管呢都在了，我就想問大家怎麼去理解這樣的一個工程，這樣的我們要做那個軟

176
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:45,090
你的，譬如説一些主要的指標，key performance index KPI是什麼樣的東西？大家有什麼那個目標？啊，三年以後應該是怎麼樣？五年以後應該是怎麼樣？大家的願景是怎麼樣？到那個時候，我們可可以期待大家做了什麼工作，出來什麼東西，我都希望能夠講一講。

177
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,090
Okay.

178
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,110
啊。

179
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,470
嗯。

180
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,540
As I'm sitting here, I just want.

181
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,900
Infrastructure in the city, and of that I am certain.

182
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,950
Yeah, thank you. I'll pick up where Sahanya left off about.

183
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:41,180
文化是未來 for 香港，The reason that after 15 years in another city, sorry.

184
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:18,530
answer in terms of the facilities that will be open. But I don't think that's sorry. You don't have to give me the answer because I know some of this discussion. So that's why I'll give within the board, right? But

185
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:37,600
The board member or the management to answer my question to the public. Yeah. Because for me, I know. Of course, we have certain discussion already. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So that's why I'm going to ask Alison and Sir Hania to answer. All right, Miss Friedman. Oh, who would? Okay.

186
00:38:47,710 --> 00:39:07,720
Honestly, I'd like to to ask Alison and Sahania to start because I think they're at the front end of the software development. But let me say, yes, we do have KPIs. We report to the board on these, and of course they're being refined as we get moving from development to operation. They will change. In terms of three years, five years, I can give you the simple.

187
00:39:40,810 --> 00:40:00,820
Let me just say that that Hong Kong has decided to build the West Kowloon Cultural District is one of the most outstanding pieces of cultural infrastructure in the world, and it is known as such internationally. That Hong Kong people have invested in our city here with this level.

188
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:20,830
of ambition is extraordinary. When you ask what is the vision, the vision is transformation of this city. There is no question in my mind that the software that is being built in West Kaluan Cultural District right now, and certainly at M Plus, is one that will transform the city.

189
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:40,840
Change the positioning of the city internationally as well as internally, both outside and inside. This is—I am absolutely certain of it. I've come from Australia, where I worked on a similar project in a much smaller city than Hong Kong, in Brisbane, and saw transformation take place.

190
00:40:40,840 --> 00:41:00,850
through cultural infrastructure, but this is of a whole other dimension, and I am certain of it. And why I say that is because of the calibre of the content being put together, the collections, the exhibitions, the learning teams, the young young people being trained, the capacity.

191
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:20,860
這就是需要的。香港是領先在金融，在一整套的其他事情，而現在是我們的時刻去爭取文化資本，而這是一個非常重要的部分，成為一個主要的國際文化城市，是發展。

192
00:41:41,770 --> 00:42:01,780
15年在另一個城市，代替移回我的家鄉，我來這裡是因為我被這個轉變的視覺所啟發。正如Sahania説，香港已經有所有其他東西，它是最好的購物、吃飯和旅遊城市。文化是它的未來，不僅僅是香港，而是整個亞洲。

193
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,070
噉我覺得咧。

194
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,700
頭先話賣二。

195
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,610
阿編書長。

196
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,030
跟住係黃碧雲議員。

197
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,390
誒係喺學校嗰邊嘅。

198
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:33,710
Thanks to the investment that Hong Kong has made in West Kowloon, we will in turn help Hong Kong be the thought leader of creativity and innovation for the region and the world, and everybody's watching and waiting for this.

199
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:43,330
誒主席，就我有三個問題啦。就第一個咧，就係誒，我比較關心嗰個啊社區同埋公眾參與嗰部分。咁似乎誒，如果睇誒呢度嘅講法咧，都比較多。

200
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:20,610
講係話diversity、vitality同埋個global嗰個profile係提高咗，所以多元化、活力化同埋更加突顯嗰個誒國際嘅吸引力咯。咁希望慢慢可以帶動翻個產業化，同埋令到我哋呢個整個嘅ecosystem個生態系統係更加具活力。多謝。

201
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:21,790
The world. The before our buildings have even opened, all of our colleagues have been investing in the local talent, the local artists, the local arts managers, the local infrastructure, so that the people of Hong Kong will lead this region in all genres of the art, in innovation, in creativity, and thank.

202
00:42:41,980 --> 00:43:01,990
喺誒香港嚟講咧，係有唔同嘅持份者喺替做嘅。咁雖然西九係扮咗一個其中一個，我可以講係話最重要嘅角色之一。如果用嗰個比例咧，如果我哋呢個文化嘅願景係一個皇冠的話咧，西九肯定係皇冠上邊一個最亮麗嘅一粒珠寶。咁但係呢粒珠寶要閃亮咧，都係比其他。

203
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:22,000
係託住嘅噉，或者我用誒五六句去簡單講啦。咁首先，將以政府係會投入咗好多，包括係民政事務局咧，同埋係康文署。咁康文署有好多個表演嘅場地啦。咁亦都我哋都知道咧，如果淨係靠一間官員咧去推文化藝術咧係唔得嘅，因為文化藝術咧佢有個自由度，有個。

204
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:42,010
發揮有個創意嘅，咁所以政府咧亦都資助好多好多嘅團體，誒包括誒藝發局啦、誒演藝學院啦，亦都承擔唔同嘅基金，誒譬如粵劇發展基金、藝能發展基金等等咧，係推動有一啲誒大型嘅表演團體係會恆常地獲得資助，亦都有啲唔同嘅計劃畀一啲小型。

205
00:43:42,010 --> 00:44:02,020
嘅團體特別一啲新進嘅藝人可以有所表演噉，但係大家發覺咧，我哋一路嘅硬件，譬如喺誒，無論係一啲誒政府資助嘅非政府組織，或者喺康文處，都係喺聖喺香港嘅唔同角落嘅。但係西九啊，刻意一塊好大嘅地方，四十幾公頃嘅，係全塊都係做文化，同埋佢嗰種。

206
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:22,030
打造咧係一種整體嘅，將文化藝術融入咗生活裏邊嘅，有一啲係公園啊、誒開放嘅地方，畀一家大細去玩嘅。咁所以，我覺得咧，其實睇得到咧，佢將佢放為一個殿堂級，好似一個鎮山之寶噉，希望用硬件帶動軟件，然後軟件再帶動得硬件嘅發展。如果我用嗰

207
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:47,920
嘅。

208
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,170
咁似乎誒，又唔係咁多。

209
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,200
譬如呢個Amperes嘅Summer Camp。

210
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,620
咁嗰度講緊四個夏季咧。

211
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,840
咁呢啲其實都係好嘅啫，我希望你哋可以去多啲。

212
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:54,130
咁但係我哋見即係我唔知誒，西九管理局放咗幾多資源落去做社區同公眾參與啊？

213
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,970
噉你哋而家都有一啲咧，就係樂區嘅你嗰個誒Amper嘅感嘆號嚇創作。

214
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:06,710
咁但係即係我我見你哋其實真係個withdraw係太少啦，噉我希望你哋誒即係。

215
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:59,650
啊，或者係誒，即係你哋想推廣嘅，我哋想推廣嘅，關於誒誒文化或者各商各方面嘅藝術嘅創作。

216
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:14,440
其實都係誒參與嘅係得一百個學生，噉你咪即係一個新聞，你即係做得一個二十五人度嘅一個新聞cam。

217
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:06,240
誒流動創作教室，噉你哋都有去學校嘅。噉啊喺誒舊年嘅二月至六月，你哋去咗誒三十間學校。

218
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:27,070
噉我覺得真係係咪係咪太少太少人參與啊？噉我唔知啦嚇，即係我而家睇你呢一個slice，我見到係噉樣樣嚇，即係喺over過去嘅四個summers。

219
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:42,040
個好簡單，三個形容詞去總結我呢個噉嘅介紹咧，就係佢會將我哋原本已經多元化嘅係更多元化，令到我哋多元化更上七層樓。亦都應該係要西九呢個咁大型一個咁整合嘅發展咧，令到嗰個活力咧係更加突顯。亦都因為呢個活力嘅突顯同埋呢個噉嘅設計咁亮麗。

220
00:44:42,040 --> 00:45:02,050
嘅設計，於是我哋吸引咗好似阿邵康、阿Alison呢啲原本喺香港以外嘅地方工作嘅人嚟到香港，亦都我哋而家有好多全世界嘅誒誒重要嘅客人嚟到香港咧，都要求去西九望一望嘅。咁覺得呢個令到我哋喺個世界版圖上嗰個地位提高咗，所以我會。

221
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:47,360
噉啊，我唔知係咪每個新聞你都有一百個學生，咁但係其實個數目真係好少。咁另外誒，我喺以前啲會議都成日提咧，就其實雖然嗰個嘅誒建築物嗰啲infrastructure未好起好曬，但係其實冇阻礙到我哋落區嗰度做呢啲社區嘅參與同活動。

222
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:30,130
咁除咗去學校之外咧，我覺得就誒，你哋呢一個community engagement係咪都可以去到啲尋常百姓家？即係話你落到區又得唔得咧？即係喺社區嘅層面誒，唔單止係去學校，可能去屋邨啦，去唔同嘅區。

223
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:50,140
區啦，尤其是有啲咧就北區啊，或者係一啲誒偏遠一啲嘅屋村，可能佢哋會覺得使好多錢走嚟西九呢邊咧，佢哋又未必會搭車出嚟。咁可能你哋入去佢哋嗰度，去唔同嘅區域，等佢哋有機會接觸到誒文化。

224
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:27,080
我唔知可唔可以，你哋係撥翻多啲資源重點落去誒，因為我哋唔希望呢個藝術或者係西九文化區係只係為小眾一小部分嘅high end嘅嗰啲嘅誒誒市民先至會嚟接觸文化。咁所以你去到grassroot，去到唔同嘅district。

225
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:31,420
誒，我我係完全同意啊，黃碧雲議員咧就話應該誒。

226
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:23,900
Disabled groups, youth groups, teachers, all of these different targets. But you're right, we should do more. I I I understand this kind of cooperation is not limited to Hong Kong groups. Absolutely. Overseas talents, they come here and and work together with the Hong Kong talents.

227
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:47,110
去到誒唔係淨係學校，係培養緊呢一班人，等佢哋更深認識藝術，呢個係最重要嘅。噉我想問問一問就係，即係你哋誒誒，即係可唔可以再放多啲資源去做好呢樣嘢？誒，另外你有啲amplas嘅放映會，噉就喺週末做，噉我唔知你喺邊度。

228
00:48:47,110 --> 00:49:07,120
做啊，同埋你哋嘅宣傳係點樣咧？可唔可以令到多啲人都知道咧？咁咁誒誒，係咪唔收費嘅咧？咁咁似乎唔係好多市民知道你哋有啲噉嘅放映會或者啲噉嘅活動嘅。噉我諗你哋可能要要要加強嗰個宣傳。咁誒，另外就係。

229
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:27,130
係關於嗰個導賞員嘅招募同培訓，噉我覺得呢個都係good idea。但係個問題就係你招募嘅對象，佢哋需要有啲咩條件咧？你又畀佢啲咩培訓咧？係令到佢哋可以透過呢個義工參與，佢哋自己都有有成長、有學習，又可以帶動到其他人。噉我去問嘅。

230
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:47,140
問題。Mr. Chairman, let me start with the general point. In fact, we have a programme of working with the district councils. For example, last year we had three district councils we worked with. Central and Western District Council had over 12,000 people joined that programme. We're already talking to, I think, Shatin.

231
00:49:47,140 --> 00:50:07,150
And we're talking to others, so we are reaching out to the districts through the district council network. But there are eighteen district. Yes, exactly. We do three or four a year, depending on their own programme. We don't force them to work with us. We approach them and offer them a chance to work with us. We also have outreach through the rover to community groups, and we.

232
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:27,160
We do take it to the districts, to public housing estates, to community centres. That's already part of the programme. So the figures that you see in terms of the school attendance is only part of the total programme that we use. On top of that, we're also working with art for the disabled groups because we see the disabled as a particularly important target.

233
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:47,170
target for us. So, for example, at Free Space happening on on Sunday, we had a group from the arts with the disabled that are running programmes for us in the district because we think that that connection is very important to develop. Perhaps Sirhan, you can talk about the M+ stage. Yes, just to add, for sure, we do reach out to.

234
00:50:47,170 --> 00:51:07,180
community groups as well as schools. the the program is devised over two semesters. it's a travelling studio and and we have to work through with community groups and schools the access arrangements as well as their own program. so we fit in with what they have.

235
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:56,640
要嘅，噉我就純粹想問下，誒而家呢啲訓練嘅係義工，噉佢可能做完一段時間又未必會一路咁做喺度啦，有冇全職嘅同事嘅咧？嚇，就係呢兩樣嘢啫。唔該。

236
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:23,450
咁多有關本土或者外國嘅文化嚇，亦都啊響啊或者合作上邊咧，亦都可以做得更闊啊，更更深嘅。咁跟住落嚟啊，周浩鼎議員。

237
00:53:51,710 --> 00:54:09,730
啦！我相信如果你係有資源嘅問題咧，我哋都會好支持你去啊申請一啲經費啊，令到我哋啊市民啊講啊，即係依個啊可以更加多啲認識依個西九文化區香港。

238
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:27,190
Already planned. It's an essential part of what we do, and reaching out to the community is very, very important. In terms of docents, the training is very intense. They work very closely with our learning team, our learning curators, and the curators vis-à-vis each individual exhibition. We also have

239
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:47,200
有那open up series，那我們initiated，所以那他們get access to some of the world's best thinkers on museum training。We and we do that for free。In relation to the screenings programme， we do have to charge， because that is part of our relationship with Yomate。

240
00:51:47,200 --> 00:52:07,210
Broadway cinema take, it's usually between eighty to ninety per cent subscribed by individuals. But I take your point about being more savvy about advertising and marketing. We we have so many art teachers in secondary school, primary school and in tertiary education.

241
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:27,360
Did you ever try to contact them, get them together and tell them what kind of resources we have? We also do do art education. Yes, we do teacher training, just for teachers in high schools and primary schools, and preschools. We bring them in without.

242
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:47,370
Their students to do training and offer them what they would ask them what they would like in relation to student students visiting the pavilion. So we do that quite separate to Rover. We do a training for teachers. Absolutely. And indeed, can I just add that we're working with the Hong Kong Federation of

243
00:52:47,370 --> 00:53:07,380
Youth groups to try and increase the scope, and it's it's worked very well. For example, they they put on a separate coach to go around touring with an acapella group last year, which raised awareness of some of the programmes that they have, which we help sponsor. So we're targeting different group district groups.

244
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:51,710
去多啲區去介紹推廣，咁咧而家只係去咗三個區咧，似乎係少啲。噉啊學校啊或者其他嘅團體咧，我覺得如果係做多啲咧啊會更好嘅。噉係咪一個資源嘅問題咧？啊，噉我聽到啊啊黃議員正話呢個提議咧。

245
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:44,450
唔該啊，主席，我講之前咧，我想好嚴肅咁做個回應咧，就係誒，我同意啊，主席你講咧，香港咧兩文三語嘅地方嚟嘅，誒，對於即係嚟到嘅嘉賓選擇邊一種嘅語言，我哋都係尊重。但係因為頭先有委員咧嗰種發言嘅講法，係會令到人哋。

246
00:54:44,450 --> 00:55:04,460
誤會我哋刻意咁貶低普通話嘅，所以我諗我都我自己作為即係呢個委員嘅成員，之後我係應該，我希望大家聽翻清楚，即係我哋兩文三語絕對係尊重，冇任何貶低普通話嘅意思，係個別嘅委員噉嘅講法係會令人哋有誤會嘅。即係我諗想呢樣真係要講翻清楚誒。

247
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:24,470
咁首先咧，我就誒有一個嘅誒意見同一個問題啦。咁首先講咗意見先咧，就係嗯，當然啦，我睇到即係而家大家都做緊好多嘅功夫，我特別同意頭先有講者提到咧，啊，香港其實除咗我哋畀人認知嘅係啊啊一。

248
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:44,480
一個金融中心之外啦，其實我哋亦都可以係一個誒匯聚文化嘅中心嚟嘅。我亦都希望呢樣嘢透過我哋西九呢個文化區咧，能夠推廣畀全世界睇。我覺得呢樣嘢係我哋有嘅資產，同埋非常值得做嘅。誒，其中一個少少嘅意見咧，就係。

249
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:26,720
嗯。

250
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:29,780
O.K.

251
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:16,110
大學培育出嚟嘅咧，咁多而家好多知名。

252
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:27,650
作為我們的保安人員，因為他們都交集在一起，在訪客體驗方面，我們知道需要絕對完美。

253
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:49,680
個網絡咧，佢哋嘅親親朋戚友啦，都可以啊多啲合作，咁咧亦都可以揾呢個基地咧，作為啊啊你哋培養觀眾。

254
01:00:50,680 --> 01:01:06,060
誒，等到佢哋成為一批新嘅種子嚇，噉啊，而家我哋需要多啲年輕嘅人嚇，老嘅嚇，唔係淨係聽粵曲、聽京劇啊，噉我都look forward to啊，下個星期嗰個。

255
00:55:44,490 --> 00:56:04,500
啊！我最近留意到啦，即係有啲啊部分嘅荷里活嘅電影咧，其實係用咗香港嚟做故事嘅背景，其實係有嘅。噉啊，我亦都最近睇過一套戲咧，就叫做即係《Crazy Rich Asians》啦嚇，即係有套噉嘅戲。噉佢嘅戲咧，其實就攞新加坡嚟做背景。

256
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:24,510
但係我點解攞呢個位嚟講咧？就係其實我哋而家西九有咁多嘅呢啲咁聚焦做嘅文化工作咧，我哋都希望唔知會唔會管理局將來有機會，如果能夠喺一啲世界嘅電影上面咧，同到佢哋有啲合作，可以喺佢哋嗰啲電影嘅脈絡裏面，將我哋呢一個嘅即係。

257
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:44,520
香港係世界匯聚文化一個中心咧，呢樣嘢或者就係西九呢樣嘢，可以喺啲電影度講到出嚟。其實係潛移默化咁畀人知嘅。因為我自己本身我就算睇一套戲，我叫我睇完之後，起碼一樣嘢啲人知道多咗關於新加坡嘅嘢。噉我覺得其實呢個咧都可以一個將來大家。

258
00:56:44,520 --> 00:57:04,530
考慮下個諗法嚟嘅，咁呢個只係一個意見嚟嘅啫嚇。咁第二咧就一個問題咧，就係我見到咧誒計劃你哋畀出嚟咧有講過咧，就係嗰個誒導賞員嘅義工訓練計劃。噉我都見到咧，其實過去咧都訓練咗一百零六位嘅導賞員嘅。但我就想問下咧，其實呢一啲嘅。

259
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:24,540
導賞員係咪佢哋一定就係義工嚟咧？定還是佢哋會唔會有啲係全職嘅同事喺度幫手咧？因為我過去有啲經驗去過其他嘅地方一啲嘅博物館，我係見過有一啲我令我感覺到好認真，亦都係令我真係好讚賞不絕嘅導賞員係。

260
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:44,550
誒有幽默感啦，咁再加埋佢係好輕鬆咁表達到曬所有講街嘅一啲，就算你以為好沉悶嘅知識，經佢咁講完出嚟咧，係令你好好愉快嘅。咁誒，我諗呢種導賞員咧，其實係對嗰個整個嘅啊博物館或者嗰個地點嚟講係重。

261
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:16,930
Duncan, Mr. Chairman, just a comment. We we actually have already appeared in an international film. It's something we'll look more at once we get more buildings. Right. Well, he's not aware of that. Maybe you have to do more publicity to. He should have watched that film instead of crazy rich Asians. I I can say that.

262
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:36,940
Crazy Rich Asians mentions M Plus in the book. Yeah, so yeah, so we are already appearing in that space. So it's it's good good for you to know regarding docents. Docents actually are one of the most committed groups of museum workers in the world.

263
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:56,950
And our docents are no different. It's an incredible group of of people who want to enhance the visitor relationship for people walking into our museum. And right now, that is via the the pavilion site. The training is intensive.

264
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:16,960
challengeing， but they all know that they are the first face of the museum for most visitors. And we work. We have dedicated trainers in our curatorial learning team to do exactly that. But we also work very closely with our visitor services team, as well.

265
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:50,820
最後咧，我都想問一問咧。其實我都留意到咧，響局方介紹嗰度咧，就講有關大學嗰個參與啊嘅方法啊程度咧，就唔係講得太多嘅。但係我哋香港嘅大學生咧，即係好多都係修讀呢個藝術文化啊，噉佢喺呢一方面咧。

266
00:59:50,820 --> 01:00:10,830
就我認為，如果佢哋可以多啲機會去西九嗰度啊參與嚇或者學習咧，係好事嚟㗎。噉啊，我哋亦都希望將來佢哋可以啊，因為依啲噉嘅經驗咧，喺唔同方面發展㗎。咁另一方面咧，過去咁多年啦，我哋。

267
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,530
啊，第二輪嘅就有黃碧雲議員，仲有邊位？馬逢國議員。

268
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,160
啊，因為我哋仲有一個議題，三分鐘啦，噉啊，每人少少少。

269
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:37,290
嘅一睇，噉我哋期待喺嚟緊呢幾年咧，可以得到呢方面係倍數噉樣增長。我哋喺誒香港嘅社區參與同埋年青人嘅推廣方面嘅成果。

270
01:06:46,690 --> 01:07:00,220
主席，我都係繼續問嗰個community engagement嘅，就誒嗰個Amper嘅放映咧，你哋係咪喺草地嗰度放映，亦或係喺室內去邊度放映？即係另外再揾場地。

271
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:35,400
接咧係去社區表演嘅嗰啲唔係區議會嘅活動，係區議會嘅活動之上嘅。咁另外咧，我哋亦都有鼓勵一啲藝團咧係直接同學校咧結成一啲夥伴計劃，係誒即係幫啲學生咧係加強佢哋嗰個文化藝術嘅氛圍嘅。咁呢啲都係我哋陸陸續續喺度做緊嘅。O K。

272
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:36,400
嘅藝術家，咁其實西九係咪可以組成一個誒所謂校友聯絡網啊？令到佢哋可以一齊多啲參與、多啲聯絡，咁亦都多而家將有一笪新嘅地方畀佢哋嘅交流啦。我覺得咧係好事嚟嘅，咁而且透過呢個。

273
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:26,350
粵劇首映啊！咁但係其實講起粵劇咧，有好多年青人嘅咧，而家參與程度已經係唔係好足夠㗎啦。咁點樣可以利用一啲噉嘅聯絡網啊，等等其他嘢咧啊？不論新嘅舊嘅，咁多啲新舊交流，噉啊～

274
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:46,360
我覺得係係一件好事嚟㗎。咁呢個興趣係要培養㗎，唔係話一場半場咧就可以解決得到嘅。啊，甚至係可以以一啲行動啊或者金錢去去支持呢啲嘅啊係啊呢個藝術創作等等嘅啊，所以。

275
01:01:46,360 --> 01:02:06,370
我覺得啊啊，黃議員正話提出嚟咧，即係佢大家咧睇察到咧，而家唔係咁多人知嗱，點樣去擴擴闊呢個範圍咧？擴闊多啲人可以參與嘅咧，即係我都希望啊，政府同埋局方咧都去參考一下。我我正話就講大學啊，其實啊，社區又好。

276
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:26,380
好多大小唔同嘅藝術團體咧，佢哋都希望多啲瞭解、多啲參與嘅。噉我我我都想問一問政府同埋誒局方咧，喺呢一方面，即係你哋會點樣處理咧？誒係咪將來嗰個outreach嚇學校嘅outreach同埋社區嘅outreach嗰度誒擴大嚟做咧？

277
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:47,590
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll ask Louis to talk about the C two issue specifically. But let me just very quickly deal with the universities. You're absolutely right; they are a key key target. In fact, earlier last year, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the APA, for example, because they're a key target for us training.

278
01:02:47,590 --> 01:03:07,600
partnership going forward, we're already working through M Plus with Hong Kong U. We're also working with international universities because we see this as very much an international scope. So, for example, Goldsmith in the UK, we've been working. We had a group of alumni come through recently. I can't remember. Alison, who is that group from the alumni?

279
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:27,610
Stanford. So we are reaching out and targeting universities and their alumni as a particular group. In terms of the publicity efforts, in fact, we are focused obviously at the moment on CITU, and I think everybody knows what's happening on the CITU side. As we get closer to opening.

280
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:47,620
different facilities. The next one will be Free Space in May. Then the focus will shift towards more towards Free Space. In any case, we hope shortly to be updating our website because that is nowadays for younger people a key source of information. So our web presence, our website, our social media presence that's all.

281
01:03:47,620 --> 01:04:07,630
being developed as as we move forward. So perhaps Louis, you can talk about the C2 development. 好啊，多謝主席。誒，其實喺誒社區個參與啊，同埋誒點樣同年青人參與個方面咧，我哋嘅經驗咧就係過往喺好多年裏邊咧，因為我哋未有自己嘅場地，噉我哋比較

282
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,390
啊，主席。

283
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,760
人真係同你connect到啊！

284
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,480
西九文化區係已經有嘢係做緊㗎啦。

285
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:50,980
就放映唔同嘅一啲，無論係不同形式嘅藝術。

286
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:46,130
喺嗰個park嗰邊做，到夜晚就放映。

287
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:06,900
嗰個調節上咧，係可能誒唔能夠期望以一個即係一般已經起好曬嘅設施去係咯嚇。

288
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:27,640
多咧係一啲户外嘅活動裏邊咧，同埋一啲誒外展嘅活動裏邊，裏邊嚟到做咁誒。隨住戲曲中心嘅開幕咧，噉我哋見得到咧就我哋越嚟越多呢類噉嘅活動會發生㗎啦。咁頭先同誒同事有提過一啲我哋唔同嘅導賞員計劃啦，誒我哋嗰啲場地導覽嘅計劃啦，誒噉我哋亦都係。

289
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:47,650
得到一個誒基金會嘅贊助咧，戲曲中心裏邊咧，我哋可以每個月咧都做到誒兩場誒，畀誒中學生嚟到睇誒戲曲嘅導賞嘅一個計劃。咁呢個咧係會維持嚟緊嗰三年都會咁做。噉我諗隨住越嚟越多場地啦，頭先誒，登勤都有講今年戲曲中心。

290
01:04:47,650 --> 01:05:07,660
跟住誒自由空間，咁跟住咧就到Amplus嘅場地出現咗之後咧，我哋有自己嘅場地之後咧，我哋一定係我哋誒社區參與啊，同埋誒年青人嘅活動咧，一定係以誒倍數或者係十倍噉樣嚟到增長，因為誒我哋好多嘅建築出到嚟嘅時候咧，自然咧就伴。

291
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:27,670
本身係好似喜谷中心咁啦，已經變成一個地標噉樣樣。本身已經好多吸引好多人。噉我相信誒，隨住自係空間同埋emphas誒開幕咗之後咧，自動就真係會出到一個一個區噉樣嘅形象，凝聚到大家嘅注意力。咁無論係本地啊，或者係外國嚟咧，都會嚟香誒嚟到西九嚟去睇。

292
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:57,580
好，簡單嘅係講幾句。誒，其實咧係誒教育局同埋係誒民政局咧，其實都係攜手係喺學校同埋大學裏邊推廣嘅。誒，首先喺基礎教育階段咧，誒文化藝術係八個關鍵項目之一。咁高中有部分同學咧係選修文化藝術呢個，噉我唔詳盡呢個啦。咁另外咧喺一

293
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:17,590
般而言咧，我哋其實有學校文化日啦，誒高中學生體驗計劃啦，誒中學生嘅演藝誒上色計劃啊，或者係戲棚粵劇等等。亦都咧，我哋喺誒二零一八一九開始咧，通過康文署咧，我哋做咗兩樣嘢嘅。第一咧，我哋有個社區文化大事嘅計劃。另外咧，我哋亦都會資助啲藝團咧，係直

294
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:21,230
百老匯、油油麻地嗰邊，誒，其實誒西九嗰邊我哋去睇過啦。你有個好靚嘅park，有好大笪草地。其實嗰個park應該已經係available，即係好快可以用。即係其實你你哋可唔可以即嗱？因為而家你哋樣嘢都做啲，但係就唔好講。

295
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:41,250
同埋唔係好多人知道，識得去參與。譬如你可唔可以regular噉樣，即係每個禮拜六或者禮拜日，你可能喺daytime日頭嘅時候，你有一啲誒workshop或者有啲activities誒，無論你係跳舞又好，或者係一啲creative嘅一啲創作，係喺日頭嘅時候。

296
01:07:51,260 --> 01:08:11,270
嘅電影噉係變咗，大家就知道逢星期六或者星期日我就去個草底去揾你哋，噉就一定有活動啦。日頭又日頭嘅活動，夜晚又放映會，咁大家咪已經習慣咗去西九文化區，而唔係喺度等你個地盤起嘢啊嘛。咁即係我唔知你，即係我。

297
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:31,280
我覺得而家最需要係多啲人知道。如果你好耐都唔搞一次，咁又冇人知道要去嗰度。咁所以如果得嘅話，你儘量係安排日頭、夜晚，總之weekend我哋嗰度一定有嘢㗎啦。大家行入嚟一定唔會令你失望嘅。噉你咪容易啲宣傳咯。咁即係我而家見到你哋做嘅嘢係唔係咁多人？

298
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:54,050
即係可能係一here and there有啲人就同你哋engage到，但係其他啲人就唔係真係咁engage。我唔知你哋係咪宣傳上面，即係因為你間唔中有啲嘢，又唔可以話你冇嘢。你明唔明啊？即係你可唔可以有個commitment話我哋由而家開始，我哋個park一ready，我哋根本。

299
01:08:54,050 --> 01:09:14,060
每個weekend都有活動，大家可以嚟嘅噉。如果你唔夠資源，我相信西九管理局或者康文署都可以鋪多啲resources落嚟去做呢啲噉樣嘅活動啦。咁當然另外你亦都要出去出邊weekday你咪出去出邊咯，或者weekend可唔可以叫啲人埋嚟咧咁？等佢習慣咗之後，身

300
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,410
所以你 have to time it anyway.

301
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,130
啊，最後係請阿馬逢國議員。

302
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:13,800
When she did her secret tour, because that's the way it should be.

303
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:08,270
In conjunction with the LCSD, so we're we're going to be working with them. The difference, I think, is that in terms of our

304
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:40,110
啊！唔係，我淨係想講一句咧。誒，我明白黃議員嘅睇法嘅，因為講真，我未做呢個位之前，我都唔係好留意西九咧。實在太忙，即係我係講一句公道話啫。因為我上咗呢個位之後咧，我其實就自己未服行過西九都好幾次，即係第一次，因為我唔冇通知任何同事啊。即係意思，我意思係話誒。

305
01:09:40,110 --> 01:10:00,120
誒誒誒，我係完全冇通知任何人，我係自己weekend就搭公共交通去到我自己。因為我噉樣樣，我先可以有增長去睇到。噉我去到嘅時候咧，我發覺咧佢個open space咧，即係誒明白一點咧，就係我當初第一次去咧，佢喺M家附近係起緊好多嘢嘅，所以係睇唔到乜仔。到後來佢而家開。

306
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:20,130
放咗咧，佢好多時都有活動嘅。你上佢個網頁咧，係睇到佢好多時weekend咧，即係即禮拜六日啦都有嘅。噉我亦都咧自己曾經誒自己去M家誒去戲曲中心去開咗台之後，我即入去咗兩次戲曲中心咧去睇，噉就拉埋衫尾聽啲導賞員介紹嘅。咁所以其實總的嚟講，

307
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:40,140
講咧，我覺得以一個啱啱出咗世嘅B B仔咧，因為大家都知道其實佢啲誒設施係開放咗冇耐嘅。其實坦白講係做得唔錯。咁當然你話有冇改善嘅空間，絕對有啦。咁譬如即係宣傳嗰度可以係做好啲。咁但係總的嚟講咧，誒如果你去誒，我覺得去上網揾咧，其實見到佢茶館好多節目誒佢。

308
01:10:40,140 --> 01:11:00,150
佢嘅誒草地M家外邊嘅都好多節目噉，同埋咧係誒佢M家嗰個展覽咧都不停係換，同埋幾多元化嘅咁誒。由於佢嘅建築嗰度咧係不斷噉係變，因為佢要一路逐陸逐逐落成嗰啲嘢咧，咁可能即係大家要明白誒，佢喺嗰個空間。

309
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:27,420
Mr. Chairman, I think I need to add a couple of things. Really, we have had a film show already as part of Free Space, and in fact, our programming at the moment is focused on Free Space, which, as I'm sure members are aware, is every second Sunday in the winter months. The summer months, it doesn't work. It's too hot. It's too humid. People won't sit on the grass when it

310
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:49,700
the the second point really is that there are other hirers for the venue and of course weekend is the popular time for them to hire so we don't want to conflict by pre-booking the facilities to preclude other people using the venues so again there are restrictions on our ability which is why we think once a

311
01:11:49,700 --> 01:12:09,710
是about right for our dominance of the use of the site. Having said that, as more facilities come on stream, particularly the indoor facilities, free space for example, that gives us the opportunity to do more in the summer months, and we will reconsider that. But I have to say I'm delighted to hear that the permanent secretary didn't find anything surprising.

312
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:39,000
嗯，謝謝主席，我還是想跟進我剛才説的，因為我我覺得沒有答答覆我的問題，就是説那個，啊，比如説LCSD，他也在做很多的活動嘛，啊，我是説你怎麼樣去識別新酒做的，跟我們原來做的，啊，包括你現在説什麼徐安華的。

313
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:59,010
電影人生，我們電影資料館，任何時候都可以做類似的program，所以一定要説給大家知道，就是你有那麼豐富的豐厚的資源，你的願景，跟原來的有什麼不同？你帶領香港的文化藝術的發展到怎麼樣一個層次？然後你這個vision，你這個那個。

314
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:19,020
願景如何能夠實施嘛？實施的時候，你一定有很多的那個衡量的指標，就是那個key performance index，那個是怎麼定？因為現在已經馬上開始了，還而且已經有一些活動已經開始組織了，那你怎麼樣來評價？怎麼樣來衡量自己的那個工作到底那個成？

315
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,260
走啦！

316
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,390
誒到此為止。

317
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:05,020
啊！主席，或者佢哋換位，而時候開始做緊。

318
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,640
O.K.咁咧就誒呢個環節咧就。

319
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:02,310
府啊，同埋西九管理局嘅代表咧，就入嚟會議室嘅。

320
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:11,080
O.K.噉，不如我哋而家就開始先。咁首先，或者請。

321
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:39,030
是如何，所以我問是這個問題，但係我覺得剛才沒有答到我這個問題。啊，謝謝主席。Mr Chairman, we have a whole range of KPIs. In fact, I did try to answer that question earlier. The whole point was that the KPIs have been drawn up at the moment in terms of the delivery of the project, so the primary focus is on.

322
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:59,040
Safety, health, the commitment in terms of the programming for the development of the individual facilities. As we're moving into the operational phase, then we start to look much more at audience numbers, attendance at events, programming and exhibitions. We will be doing audio.

323
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:19,050
surveys and we've already started that programme, both in terms of our audience, but also in terms of general surveys, sort of equivalent of the government's household survey, to get awareness within our organisation as to what are the issues that we need to address, and they will then inform the function of drawing up the KPIs.

324
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:39,060
KPIs are then reported annually to the board, as well as individually to the relevant subcommittees. So that's part of the process that we're developing. To go back to the first part of the question, how do we differentiate with LCSD? Well, actually, we see and I'm sure LCSD see us as partners.

325
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:59,070
We need to work with them. We are already working with them, and we, for example, when we did the popular culture show at the M Plus Pavilion, we were very graciously loaned some items for inclusion in that show from L C S D. Likewise, the Situ Festival that's coming up is.

326
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:28,560
focus。It's very much about the the the highest level of performance. We won't be taking, honestly, the NGOs to come in and book our facilities, which is what LCSD has to do. It's quite right. That's not our target. We'll be working with the professional groups. We'll be working with the highest standards, and that's the differentia.

327
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:48,570
非常straightforward，李書長，誒主席，因誒想補充幾句咧，因為呢個係誒政府同西九嘅互相配合咁願景，我哋係有嘅噉，但係呢一個願景咧，亦都係要一路行實踐落去啦，係一路誒一個誒一個活嘅，係互相配合嘅。譬如我舉一個好簡單嘅例子啦。

328
01:15:48,570 --> 01:16:08,580
因為戲曲中心啱啱落成啊，大家知道喺戲曲裏邊咧，誒，除咗西九，我哋有油麻地戲院，有高山劇場，誒，亦都咧係沙田、元朗、葵青北區呢啲地方咧都有做粵劇嘅。咁如果大家係睇睇佢嘅節目表咧，其實一睇完之後，你都已經好明白，中間一定有個定位嘅分別。

329
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:28,590
嘅，譬如誒，我諗誒頭先好似柏志高先生講咧，喺康文署嘅場地咧，如果係一個非政府組織，係一個誒不牟利嘅組織咧，佢係可以喺個場地租任嗰方面咧，係有一個所謂係誒相宜啲嘅價錢嘅。但係西九佢主要睇咧就係個藝術嘅成分、藝術嘅含量，同埋喺當然即有時。

330
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:48,600
係一個程度上嘅分別，譬如我哋有其他嘅地方可以畀一啲新進嘅劇場，或者係啲新手錶演，甚至一啲老人家做粵劇。但係我諗西九未必會係做呢啲，因為佢係殿堂級，係世界級嘅。咁所以如果我哋睇嘅時候咧，誒一拼所有嘅場地去睇咧，其實睇個節目表都已經係模模糊糊係睇到佢嘅分嘢㗎啦。

331
01:16:48,600 --> 01:17:08,610
咁當然，佢日後其他嘅表演場地一路出嘅時候，我哋會一路係大家係保持密切嘅聯繫咧，係會大家去誒誒誒繼續磋商點樣去令到咧係喺大家誒，你話完全冇重疊係唔可能嘅，但係係會大家喺個定位上咧係會誒有個分嘢嘅，令到西九係真。

332
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:28,620
係喺我哋整個文化藝術嘅誒嘅景象裏邊咧，係行得叫係最國際化、最殿堂級、係最高端嘅一個。因為服務社羣、服務基層嘅咧，噉係翻一個政府係通過康文署同埋民政事務局啊，同埋係誒區議會呢啲去。

333
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:10,290
present the main points because yeah absolutely. I I like to to allow more time for my members to we we only have one slide. Thank you.

334
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:39,280
場誒嗰度嘅上蓋嘅發展咧，其實誒喺依個藝術廣場北邊嗰兩座嘅誒。

335
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:07,910
咧係相等於十個，我重複係十個嘅香港大球場，或者係相等於七十七個嘅標準游泳池嘅。

336
01:21:48,210 --> 01:22:01,940
啊！彭亞妮女士咧，係對呢個撥款嘅建議咧，作更詳細嘅解釋。多謝。好，Mr. Chairman，I'll ask Y.C. to introduce the the first part of the presentation， and we'll hand over. I like you to just

337
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:56,970
咁咧就誒多謝政府同埋西九管理局嘅代表咧嚟到今日介紹有關誒依個文化軟件嘅發展嘅。噉我哋就會進入去第二個環節，就係西九文化區兩區嘅最新發展。咁咧，首先咧，我哋就係請有關嘅政府。

338
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:34,300
啊，秘書長，你介紹今日有關嘅啊文件好嘛？好誒，主席，管理局咧係採納咗four zero partner嘅概念圖咧，作為怡貝西九發展圖質嘅基礎。咁綜合地庫咧係呢個概念圖質嘅主要組成部分嘅。噉佢嘅目的咧就係將行車嘅交通咧就放喺地底，以騰。

339
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:54,310
出地面嘅空間作為文化藝術嘅用途嘅，咁而綜合地庫二區咧就係最大型嘅地庫區嘅。噉我哋今日咧除咗向委員匯報西九二區嘅最新發展之外咧，亦都會簡介七六三C優號嘅工程計劃、西九文化區綜合地庫餘下工程提升為甲級撥款嘅建議嘅。

340
01:18:54,390 --> 01:19:14,400
咁已進行綜合地庫二區餘下嘅工程，咁按付款當日嘅價格計算咧，估計所需嘅費用咧係一百七十五億嘅。噉我令到亦都希望咧，利用少少嘅時間去講講最近即係呢幾日喺報章見到嘅一啲誒對於呢一個嘅誒申請撥款嘅一啲誒誒資料，我想做一個解釋嘅。咁

341
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:34,410
有有啲人咧係問點解嗰陣時政府喺二零零八年批出嘅二百一十六億唔可以包含呢樣嘢啊？呢個額外撥款係咪政府有少少係誒誒毀咗佢嘅諾言，唔再攞錢啊？噉我想澄清咧，呢個二零零八年畀二一六誒二百一十六億嘅咧就係興建核心嘅文化藝術設施啊，其他。

342
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:54,420
嘅文化設施等等嘅，連呢一個噉嘅綜合地庫嘅概念啦，喺零零喺二零零九至一一年間進行過三個階段嘅諮詢，然後採納咗fourstand partner。咁喺時序度咧，亦都睇得到咧。其實呢個綜合地庫係並非我重複一次係並非涵蓋喺二零零八年才為。

343
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:18,210
咁咧就另外咧，我亦都想講講咧，就係話其實呢一個而家撥款嘅一百七十五億咧，一誒其實係同當初二零一四年嘅估算係相若嘅。二零一四年咧，我哋嘅估算咧，當期時已經估算咧個成本咧係大概係二百三十億嘅，二百三十億咁喺二零一。

344
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:38,220
五年嘅七月同埋二零一八年嘅一月咧，我哋係分別係嚟個財委會兩次係撥款嘅。咁嗰陣時，總共咧要嘅撥款咧係誒分開係三筆嘅，一個係二十七點二億，一個係三十一點八億，一個係二億嘅。咁剩翻餘下咧就係一百七十，咁同我哋而家攞嘅一百七十五點五咧，其實係非常之相近嘅。

345
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:58,230
咁最後一點咧，我想講講埋咧，就係話有啲人話係咪好貴啊？呢個設施其實大家如果睇翻個地咧嗰個size咧，就會知道咧，其實呢個價錢係誒邊個同事嘅誒誒土木工程拓展處嘅同事睇過咧，都係屬於合理嘅。其實呢個地綜合地庫二區嘅規模。

346
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:28,200
咁同時間咧，佢有別於一邊嘅地庫咧，其實呢個綜合二區嘅地庫嘅工程咧，係需要滿足多項功能上嘅特殊需要嘅。譬如佢承託於綜合地庫二區上邊嘅上蓋發展，亦都係要容納一個係大概零點八公里長，可以畀雙層巴士。

347
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,750
個接駁嘅。

348
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,610
委會批出嘅二百一十六億嘅撥款之內嘅。

349
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,220
誒辦公室嘅大樓咧，同埋咧喺佢喺依個誒。

350
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,060
綜合地庫咧，亦都係支持呢個西九文化區嘅基礎建設嗰個中樞嘅骨幹。

351
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:46,020
嘅設施，誒，呢個咧都係喺呢個規劃裏邊咧，係誒希望咧係盡早嚟去展開。

352
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:48,960
誒，我哋呢啲餘下嘅工程咧，都係集中喺咧綜合地庫嘅二區嘅範圍。而家我哋圖片咧見到誒二區嘅範圍裏邊嘅。

353
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:18,360
誒而家西九嘅發展咧，其實係正係跟住當年誒公眾諮詢所採納嘅方案，同埋咧係政府之前向立法局交代嘅誒發展模式咧嚟到去推行。

354
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:40,550
而且咧，我哋都得到一啲階段性嘅誒成果嘅。今次咧，我哋七六三C油號工程計劃咧，誒提升為甲級嘅撥款申請咧，主要都係用作咧推展呢個西九文化區綜合地庫嘅餘下工程啦，嚟配合咧西九文化區呢個分階段發展嘅。

355
01:23:44,570 --> 01:24:01,730
嗯誒演藝綜合劇場側邊嘅一個藝術家嘅旅舍同埋公寓咧，其實嗰個誒籌劃工程亦都係誒進行當中，我哋咧都係諗住用一個誒B.O.G.建造營運同埋咧係轉讓嘅方式咧，係誒盡快咧係開展。

356
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:19,770
誒上蓋嘅發展咧，係需要有呢個地庫嘅發展咧嚟到配合㗎，誒先至可以咧係同步嚟到進行。因為綜合地庫咧嘅設計咧係提供咗必要嘅交通道路網絡以及咧係停車位，呢個都係上蓋發展咧係必須要嘅設施嚟嘅。

357
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:48,210
使用嘅地下行車道同埋相關嘅設施，亦都會容納一啲配套，例如停車場啊、上落客貨區啊，同埋各種嘅公用設施。咁誒咁做最後咧，我就想誒請請阿柏志高先生咧係作一個即係誒補充嘅介紹，同埋亦都請土木工程拓展處南拓展處處長。

358
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:30,950
或者我用而家依張依張slide咧就簡好好簡短咧介紹一下而家嗰個地庫嘅工程嘅進度。其實個地庫咧，如果大家睇翻個圖咧，係喺誒三B嘅松嗰度咧，係開始一路咧就去到戲曲誒側邊嗰度咧就停止。噉啊，住依條地下行車路咧。

359
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:50,960
咧亦都喺三A嗰邊咧係開始咗。咁其實大部分嘅誒已經開展嘅地庫工程咧，就喺三B嘅誒，我哋依個誒演藝綜合劇場嘅地庫咧已經係展開咗㗎啦。誒而喺二A棟嗰度咧，誒高鐵咧佢哋都開始咧係交還。

360
01:22:50,960 --> 01:23:10,970
佢哋嘅誒土地啦，因為誒高鐵亦都開咗幕喺嗰一邊咧，亦都係有部分嘅結構咧，亦都係已經係誒完成咗呢個綜合地庫。咁所以其實整體嘅地庫工程咧，誒係差唔多有二十五至到三十個percent咧，係已經開展咗或者咧係誒進行當中嘅啊。

361
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:30,980
誒另外咧就係至於上蓋嘅發展咧，喺已有嘅誒地庫嗰度咧，誒其實喺M加咧，我哋已經係平頂咗啦。誒綜合演藝嘅綜合劇場嘅工程咧，我哋亦都係誒批出咗呢個合約，啊亦都係開工。至於喺誒呢個誒藝術廣

362
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:40,060
誒，至於喺而家申請撥款嘅二B、C同埋二A誒呢個地方裏邊咧，誒有關嘅文化項目咧就包括咗誒音樂中心啦、大劇院啦，同埋咧係音樂劇院喺二A裏邊咧係有一個中型嘅劇場，同埋咧係文化方面嘅教育。

363
01:24:46,300 --> 01:25:06,310
誒，至於誒喺二B、C同埋二A、C誒個地方裏邊嗰啲誒零售啊、餐飲啊，或者係呢個誒上蓋嘅建築咧，我哋都係喺規劃嘅當中咧嚟配合呢個地庫嘅發展誒，亦都係咧係打算係用一個誒B.O.T嘅形式咧嚟到進行。

364
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:38,840
或者我將而家以下嘅時間咧，係交翻畀誒土土木工程拓展處嘅誒彭女士咧，係講解呢個撥款嘅內容。好，彭女士。多謝主席。誒，我會用投影片咧，簡單噉樣介紹下今日提交文件嘅內容㗎。誒，我哋綜合地庫咧係西港文化區發展概念圖則嘅主要嘅組成部分啦，而且係一個好重要嘅角色。

365
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:38,210
噉啊！而家有五位啊，六位。

366
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:46,400
綜合地庫嘅二B、C區嘅建築計劃咧，我哋希望咧可以喺二零二零年咧就分階段咁展開嚟配合上蓋嘅發展。

367
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:18,730
呢一張投影片咧就係B二層嘅誒平面圖啦。我哋睇到咧誒，除咗一啲一般嘅停車位之外咧，都有旅遊車嘅停車位嘅。

368
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:24,830
同時間咧，我哋咧都計劃喺二零一九年嘅下半年咧，展開呢個綜合地庫二B C區嘅詳細設計，包括咧籌備呢一個誒建造工程嘅招標文件啦，同埋審批呢個標書嘅。

369
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:37,740
綜合地庫二B、C區咧，主要嘅用途都係支援上蓋嘅文化藝術設施啦，同埋誒酒店、辦公室、住宅嘅項目嘅，以及咧承託咧一段咧八百米長嘅地下人車路嘅。

370
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:08,480
再落嚟咧，我睇到誒B二M層啦，其實B二M層同B二層咧都係可以提供空間咧，畀西九管理局咧設置一啲停車位嘅，同埋咧可以有啲機房啊，其他嘅設備喺度嘅。

371
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:54,970
經過我哋路旁嘅上落客區啦，經過公共嘅電梯大堂咧，就前往到誒上邊咧誒各項嘅設施啦。將來咧管理局咧亦都希望咧喺B一層咧設置一啲貨物嘅起卸區嘅。

372
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:12,680
做依個presentation完啦，係嘛？冇其他，OK，唔該。咁誒，我就我我喺未誒請委員發言之前咧，我就想提一提啦，依個項目咧係會涉及。

373
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:20,810
我哋由呢一張剖面圖咧，就更加可以清楚睇到咧。我地庫咧就一共有三層啦，最低層咧就係B二層之上咧，我哋有B二M層同埋B一層啦。我哋建議建造誒地下行車路嘅路段咧，就喺我綜合地庫嘅B一層裏邊嘅。

374
01:28:46,680 --> 01:29:03,610
當呢一段二B C嘅地下行車路咧，喺二零二七年我哋希望完成之後咧，就可以連貫到二A區同埋二B區嘅地下行車路啦。咁咧就可以大幅咁加強咧西九文化區嘅整體嘅通達性啦，同埋內部嘅連接交通嘅。

375
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:57,960
七六三C號工程計劃咧，西九文化區綜合地庫嘅餘下工程咧，按付款當日價格計算咧，我哋估計所需嘅費用咧，大約係一百七十五億元嘅。請委員咧，備悉我哋提升七六三C號工程計劃為甲級嘅建議。誒，歡迎咧委員提問嘅。誒，多謝。好。

376
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:39,040
依張圖亦都表示到咧，我哋其實港綜合地庫裏邊咧各類嘅設施啦，包括咧西九文化區各個場館同埋上蓋發展咧，其實都好高度融合嘅。所以我哋建議咧就會委託咧管理局咧一並咁咧展開誒有關嘅工程，可以配合上蓋嘅發展咧一齊同步噉樣推行嘅。

377
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:31,790
誒呢個撥款建議嘅，咁所以根據議事規則第八十三A條嘅規定咧，如果委員要就佢有直接或者間接金錢利益嘅議題發言咧，誒委員咧係需要響披露有關利益嘅性質後先就可以發言嘅。

378
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:11,160
二A區嘅地下行車路預計喺二零二五年噉樣完成咗之後咧，屆時咧，我哋就可以通過呢個地下行車路咧嘅交界處，連接到外邊一啲外圍嘅交通，誒連接到去咩咧？就係誒柯士甸道西一個地下行車道，同埋可以直接連接到去呢個連翔道嗰度嘅。

379
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:58,850
嚟嘅將行車嘅交通咧設置喺地庫咧，就可以咧騰出地面空間咧嚟做呢個文化藝術嘅用途，並且咧係創造一個咧無車嘅地面環境畀市民享用嘅。同時間咧，對西角發展咧提供最少二十三公頃嘅公共休憩用地咧，嚟符合到呢個法定嘅要求咧，亦都係不可或缺嘅。

380
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:24,400
誒之前咧，我哋就住誒綜合地庫嘅首階段啦、第二階段同埋以及第三階段嘅撥款申請咧，已經得到財委會嘅批准㗎啦。有關嘅撥款主要咧都係用作喺三A同埋三B區嘅工程費用嚟嘅，以及咧綜合地庫二區嘅部分設計同埋工地勘測嘅費用。相關嘅工程咧，而家都係正在進行中啦。

381
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:06,220
畀啊政府嘅呢啲會計嘅數字咧，係多咗啲十六億啊？點樣應急咧？唔該。

382
01:26:49,810 --> 01:27:09,820
隨住咧個誒綜合地庫嘅發展咧，依個亦都係咧我哋誒二區咧，亦都係地庫最大區域啦。嗱，東面咧我睇到咧係誒比鄰依個戲曲中心啦，而西面咧可以通過三B嘅地庫咧誒，亦都係可以咧同依個綜合誒綜合演藝劇場嗰邊咧係誒能能夠有個。

383
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:31,990
我哋嘅誒綜合地庫二區嘅設計顧問誒工作咧，其實已經喺二零一七年嘅二月都展開咗㗎啦。管理局咧已經就住呢個誒地庫同埋上蓋發展嘅工程分項嘅策劃同埋合約安排咧，制定咗呢個分階段嘅發展計劃。所以咧，如果今次我哋得到財委會嘅批准撥款。

384
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:52,000
嘅話咧，就可以按計劃喺二零一九年嘅年中，就可以分階段咁咧展開呢個綜合地庫二A區，包括呢個地下行車路嘅建造工程㗎啦。我哋希望咧可以二零二五年咧就可以完成嚟配合咧二A區裏邊上蓋有關嘅酒店啦、誒辦公室同埋住宅發展嘅。而且咧，當我哋

385
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:41,570
接住呢張投影片咧，我哋就睇到B一層嘅平面圖，橙色嘅部分咧就係八百米長嘅地下行車路段啦。我哋睇到咧，除咗呢條路之外咧，我哋都要喺路旁咧要做啲行人路啦、上落客區啦、供水啦、排水啦、誒基電工程啊、消防設備等等啦，同埋走火通道嘅訪客咧可以通。

386
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:58,510
就我讀一讀出嚟啦，就係毛孟靜議員、姚思榮議員、黃碧雲議員、謝偉全議員、馬逢國議員同埋周浩鼎議員，就每人四分鐘。今次咧，我就會揸緊呢個時間㗎啦，因為我哋六點半咧就呢個會就完結嘅。咁首先請毛孟靜議員。啊唔該，主席嗱，之前咧聽到官員有提到咧。

387
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:18,520
咧話有關綜合地庫嘅造價撥款嚇，啊之前已經攞過分別廿七億、三十一億、兩億噉啊，即係夾埋六十億嚇。咁而佢亦都亦都提過咧，二零一四年嘅估算咧應該係二百三十億嘅。咁如果二百三十億已經攞咗六十億翻嚟咧，就應該攞。

388
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:38,530
再攞係一百七十億，就而家多咗少少，係啊，多咗五億啊六億咁上下，我就想睇睇啊有冇解釋嘅咧？即係以今時今日嚟講，五六億幾乎都不是問題，咁但係始終係數目上係有啲差距喺度嘅。誒，呢個係我主要嘅問題，其他就係我。

389
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:58,540
想問清楚，你顧問費同埋住工地人員嘅薪酬咧，就總共要十三億。咁薪酬就冇得講嘅，簽細約要畀嘅。我想問問顧問費大概係牽涉幾多咧？而最後就係應急費用咧，去到十六億，就好似真係比我平時睇。

390
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:26,610
誒，我即係請阿彭女士。好，阿彭生，阿彭署長。多謝主席，誒，多謝議員嘅提問。噉就住我哋誒嗰個撥款申請咧，係阿毛議員講得係啱嘅。我哋當時咧係再攞咗大約六十億度啦。咁但係咧，我哋當時嘅估算咧，你都知道，我哋其實係講二零一三年當時做嘅估算，假設咧我哋二零一四年。

391
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:46,620
可以開工一次過，可以起好個綜合地庫嚟做個估算。噉我哋多番響立法會咧，我哋都表示咧，嗰當時我哋做嗰都係一個粗略預算啦。因為事實上當時亦都未曾完成我哋嗰個誒設計嘅。咁所以咧，我哋就話咧，我哋應承咧，就今年嘅年初咧，我哋會翻嚟咧，同立法會彙報翻我哋其實誒。

392
01:33:46,620 --> 01:34:06,630
誒整個綜合地庫究竟要幾多錢咧？噉樣噉，所以咧，我今次咧就翻嚟同議員講咧，因為咧，我哋嗰啲圖積咧，基本上我哋有一個誒圖積嘅基本設計咧，已經同屋宇署嗰度審議咗㗎啦。所以我就基於個圖積咧，我哋就可以做啲更詳細嘅估算。咁咧，其實嗰個差別咧，即係都係誒一啲。

393
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,050
係。

394
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:38,630
成本嘅。

395
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,940
第三個問題就係。

396
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:17,390
黃碧雲議員。

397
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:19,520
主要嚟講咧，就話誒地基我哋要做啦，同埋條路要做啦，同埋一個誒石屎廊。噉我嗰個誒做嗰三層地庫咧，都係由政府誒出資嘅。誒多謝主席。

398
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:54,290
咁嗰個公共道路咧就會由政府咧去全資咧去誒做翻嗰個保養維修嘅啊，主要就係噉樣分隔嘅啫。誒，多謝主席。頭先我問有關酒店啊、住宅啊、辦公室嘅收入咧，將來會唔會補貼嗰個頭先有關工程開支嘅？

399
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:26,640
啲數字係係啱嘅，即係有幾億嗰個誒誒數字喺度。噉我想澄清翻咧，都係一啲誒好基本嘅嘢嚟，因為地庫咧本身都係啲石屎啊、鐵啊，同埋一啲挖掘嘅工程，都唔係有啲咩花巧嘢，都係實量實度咁嚟嘅啊。咁關於第二誒個問題就係話誒啲開支嘅問題啦，噉我係顧問費開支問題啦。

400
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:46,650
顧問費咧，主要嚟講咧，我哋都係會招標，即係睇下嗰個顧問誒成。我唔使問程序，我想知幾錢啫。誒呢個細數咧，我可以喺下一次咧誒上誒公務小組嘅時候咧，可以再提供一啲細數喺度嘅。咁至於嗰個風險評估咧，其實我哋內部咧一貫咧，我哋都有啲風險評估嗰個誒預。

401
01:34:46,650 --> 01:35:06,660
算即係話，譬如睇翻我哋誒一般，我哋以往誒看呢啲工程類似會有啲咩風險嘅因素咁咧，我哋會做一個誒有系統噉嘅誒估算。咁而家一般嚟講咧，我哋而家呢個估算咧都係一誒一般工程嘅預算到啦，大約都係百分之十嘅誒工程費用嘅估算，唔係一個特別。

402
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:26,670
誒話高或者係低嘅股算都係用用翻我哋一啲誒以往嘅經驗。應急咩咧？請問誒，多謝主席啊，多謝議員嘅跟進。其實其實主要嚟講咧，就話我哋咧唔會話即係冇扭入螺絲冇鋼筋係咪？工程上呢啲都算係應急嘅咧。誒，我主要嚟講咧就話咧。

403
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:46,680
有陣時候，我哋會有啲不可預見嘅情況底下咧，我哋如果預見到咧，當然我哋喺我哋估算裏邊已經評估咗啦。咁但係咧，有陣時候會有一啲誒，我哋可能未預見到嘅情況發生，噉我哋都要撥備一筆款項。咁呢啲都係一般我哋喺公務工程咧誒常規咧，我哋都會有一筆噉嘅費用喺度嘅。誒，多謝主席。

404
01:35:46,680 --> 01:36:06,690
即係銀貨先或者未能預計出嚟嘅嘅事項啦。係啊，多謝主席，冇錯，你理解。啊，姚思榮議員。誒，多謝主席。就有關誒呢個工程咧，頭先聽介紹咧，就係誒呢個嗯，佢係在其中部分工程係支撐上蓋嗰啲有關誒。

405
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:26,700
誒嘅建築嘅，嗯，包括可能酒店啦、辦公室啦或者住宅噉樣，噉嘅話咧，咁嗰啲費用咧係咪都係誒，即係所謂支撐上嘅，包括可能打樁啊、啊一啲基礎嘅工程啦。咁如果係噉話，呢啲費用係咪都係一百七十五億嗰度畀，還是喺部分咧係要？

406
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:46,710
由翻誒西九管理局嗰度畀嘅。第一個問題，第二個問題就將來，因為呢個地庫起好之後咧，有啲設施係有收入嘅。咁啲收入誒嘅話咧，有收入嘅政府將來會唔會分同西九一齊分攤，還是呢啲收入都係由西九管理局去負責誒處理嘅咧？咁？

407
01:36:49,250 --> 01:37:09,260
酒店、辦公室、住宅，將來誒誒對外有個嗯可能投標啊，或者係拍賣咁啦嚇。咁如果呢啲收入本身咧，會唔會將來補貼呢一筆一百七十五億？咪頭先講過其他嗰六十億嘅開支嘅咧，噉樣三個問題。係邊位答？誒主席，我簡單夾幾句，然後就請阿彭女士跟進。

408
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:29,270
誒誒，希望大家明白咧，其實呢個綜合地庫咧，係對於西九嚟講咧，係一個佢嘅設計嘅一個好重要嘅元素，亦都咧係西九發展土質一個誒好不可或缺嘅組成部分。因為通過呢個噉嘅綜合地庫咧，先至能夠有足夠空間騰。

409
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:49,280
出二十三公頃嘅公眾休憩嘅用地，如果唔係咧，就唔能夠符符合西南九龍分區計劃大疆圖嘅用法要求嘅。咁所以我哋一定係通過呢個綜合地庫嘅設置咧，先至可以製造一個無無車嘅地面環境，畀公眾使用同埋滿足到個分區大疆圖嘅。

410
01:37:49,330 --> 01:38:09,340
咁至於誒，我哋而家政府撥款咧，就其實係誒個綜合地庫整體一個大嘅部分。其實係你諗下，如果唔係嗰啲行車路去咗地底喺地面嘅，其實呢啲所謂嘅基礎建設都係政府負責嘅。只不過佢哋去咗地底，我哋政府係繼續負責翻呢一度啫。咁誒，至於誒。

411
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,500
然後咧，就叫佢搞掂呢幾五項工程。

412
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:43,370
誒，亦都冇講嗰個誒管理費。

413
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:41,610
盤啦，咁咁攞咗啲錢之後咧，你係畀西九管理局。

414
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:38,760
如果你整咗一個幾百億嘅地牢，如果中間出現有事，又剪鋼筋啊，又唔知點樣啲石屎啊，又擰唔埋啊，噉啊大禍啦！

415
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:07,440
其實我哋投影片咧都有誒簡單咁講咗啦，譬如尾二嗰行咧，就係管誒西九管理局咧，我哋預算畀佢嗰個誒。

416
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:55,780
咁咧就起啊成，即係去去起啲地下嘅道路啊，成個地庫係西九管理局去揾人起嘅，係咪？係咪啊？

417
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:30,120
有管理局嘅角色又係乜？因為咧，事實上我哋已經試過攋嘢咧，沙中線。我哋係見到政府根本係睇唔實，港鐵，港鐵又睇唔實，下邊啲承建商。

418
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:56,350
即係嗰個工程嘅嗰個監管嗰個管理費，誒嗰個分項係幾多嘅？咁咁如果你完全冇breakdown拎上嚟，叫誒公務小組甚至財委會批咧？

419
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:29,350
好詳細嗰個所謂interfacing個工程啦，我點樣搏接搏咧，係牽涉到好複雜嘅問題。咁所以我哋咧就呢樣嘢係攞咗錢之後咧就會委託西九幫我哋起嘅。咁此詳細嗰個數目嘅分嘢，我請阿阿女士咁講啊嚇。阿彭處長，啊多謝主席誒，多謝議員嘅提問。其實主要嚟講咧，我哋而家嗰個撥款。

420
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:49,360
費用咧都係我哋嗰啲基本備置工程嚟嘅，其實都係講緊咧我哋嗰個石屎廊為主，同埋加一條路咁解嘅啫。咁當然啦，我哋因為託住呢幾層嘅誒地庫，而地庫咧亦都係承託住上邊一啲上蓋物業。頭先嘅圖片亦都睇到咧，其實我哋每一層嘅地庫都高度融合，亦都有唔同嘅機房啊。

421
01:38:49,360 --> 01:39:09,370
設備喺度，咁當時我哋政府咧都係話誒承接呢個誒誒基，即係呢個地庫咧，其實都係畀一啲基本嘅備置工程。咁將來咧，如果係西九管理局本身佢自己嘅停車場嘅話咧，佢哋有佢自己嗰個誒通風走火咧，就由佢哋去去再做翻嗰啲設備嘅。不過咧，我哋主

422
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:39,810
咁嗰個頭先講嗰啲收入啊，嗰方面嘅開支都係將來西九負責啦，係咪？誒，多謝主席，誒，多謝議員嘅提問。誒，就住咧嗱，我哋個地庫咧本身咧誒，我哋咧就會畀發畀咗西九去營運嗰個地庫嘅。咁嗰度咧佢咧就會用日常佢嗰個保養維修嗰個地庫咧就由佢哋出資嘅。不過條路咧，因為係公共道路嚟嘅。

423
01:39:55,010 --> 01:40:15,020
Duncan, do you have something to add? Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to remind members that under the enhanced financial arrangements, there will be provision for for revenue sharing between WCDCA and the the government, and that applies to all of those income sources from HOr, from cars, etc. So there will in future be a revenue share.

424
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:37,840
誒主席，我想問問咧，就而家講緊誒個啊地庫咧，就總共喺第七段講有五項工程嘅，咁總共咧而家就講緊一百七十五億，咁但係咧就呢度冇誒分項嗰個嘅誒。

425
01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:16,640
咁似乎呢個係不可能嘅，因為我哋根本判斷唔到，譬如你嗰啲工程監管費或者顧問費，又或者每一個分項嗰度大概係幾多錢，甚至亦都唔能夠判斷到呢一個噉樣嘅價格係咪合理。咁所以，我唔知點解你哋會冇曬呢啲分項咧。我我我諗啊，常備。

426
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:36,650
喺喺政府咁多年都知道，我哋上嚟唔可能完全冇一個冧心。我開價一七五，你就要包大包曬佢噉。咁呢個係一個誒問題嚟嘅。第二，我想問清楚咧，就係頭先誒誒阿Alice都講咗，係呢個三層地庫都係由政府出資，而家要嚟立法會攞撥。

427
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:19,280
誒呢個呢個呢個係咪表達啊？抑或抑或唔係啊？我我我我諗不不如你問曬，等佢因為因為咧而家唔係好清楚咧，究竟邊個負責去成去去建造，邊個負責監管？誒，政府土木工程署嘅角色係乜？民政事務局嘅角色又係乜？西九

428
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:59,050
即係唔通又炸咗個西九地牢佢咩咁？O.K.不如等咁即係你可唔可以講清楚究竟嗰個嘅責任同監管究竟係點，同埋個breakdown係點？係阿彭處長，喂，請阿秘書長首先講講先。我講幾句係嘅誒啊！首先咧，呢個唔係B.O.T.，呢個我哋叫做entrust嘛，即係話我哋係由於兩個工程咧好多要行。

429
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,040
之前咧，大概攞咗成誒。

430
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,940
咁誒，咁呢個係咪都係BOT啊？

431
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:35,570
啊！我我諗時間到，因為我正話已經講咗，我會揸緊啲依個時間嘅嚇，噉你再第二輪再問啦，好嘛？

432
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:19,060
接嘅interface problem，所以我哋咧就係要將佢entrust咗交咗畀誒西九去幫我哋做埋個決。咁期間咧，我哋亦都係因為呢個工程嘅複雜咧，所以其實啊應芬方女士咧，其實土木工程發展處不過借咗嚟係一個誒首長級嘅第三級嘅D three嘅同事咧，而家係作為我哋H A B一部分嘅。

433
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:39,070
噉佢都代表H A B啦，開西九嘅會嘅。咁亦都同一時間咧，政府內部咧係有一個三層嘅嘅架構咧，係成立咗咧，係同誒西九管理角度咧係好緊密咁去合作嘅。噉我記得喺誒睇嗰啲數字咧，係係喺過去嗰幾個月咧，佢哋係開咗幾十次會嘅嚇，同埋係都去咗好多次嘅地。

434
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:59,080
地盤咁誒，咁所以咧，我哋明白咧，即係呢個工程係浩大，同埋亦都係一個公堂嚟嘅。咁所以土木發展工程署咧，我知道佢哋都係開咗一啲誒人手咧，係喺誒專門係做呢個工程。咁詳情我交畀阿林處長。好多謝主席，多謝議員提問。我先誒就住阿黃議員咧講話，我哋分項嗰度咧。

435
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:27,960
內部管理費嘅上限嚟嘅，即係同以往一樣啦。我哋咧就會誒成設一個上限，但係咧都係一個實報實銷嘅誒嘅嘅做法嚟，即係話咧佢哋都我哋都係見咗佢真係使咗，我哋先畀嘅。咁至於咧就話誒政府係咪一筆錢攞咗就畀咗管理局咧？絕對唔係嘅，因為咧我哋咧係。

436
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:47,970
會誒就住佢咧，因為我哋誒同佢嘅設施都有高度融合啦。咁到時候咧做咗之後咧，我哋見咗佢出咗錢，譬如畀咗承建商嗰筆錢係核對咗，由公料測量測量師睇過呢筆錢係認為係應該係政府要負責嘅部分咧，我哋會先至會畀錢，亦都係一個一個誒。

437
01:44:47,970 --> 01:45:07,980
誒實量實度誒實報實銷嘅機制咧，去畀翻錢啊，西九管理局嘅絕對唔係落咗佢袋度先嘅，而係話咧佢使幾多，我哋只係畀翻佢誒嘅嘅費用嚟嘅啫。咁至於咧就誒嗰啲分項數字咧，其實咧我哋咧誒當然啦，我哋去到公務小組會有個詳細嘅分誒分拆啦，但係咧我哋喺個個秘。

438
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:27,990
住下低嗰度咧，我哋都嘗試咧將個一百誒四十億咧，就係嗰個綜合地庫二A二B C區嘅地基啊，基本誒誒地庫結構啊，同埋道路咧，我哋就用個百分比嚟顯示咗佢嗰個誒價錢嘅。等啊，議員咧就容易啲理解咧，佢究竟我哋啲錢其實使咗去邊一度。噉我哋會誒。

439
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:48,000
盡誒盡快咧，就可誒上去公務小組嘅時候咧，我哋都會提交一啲更詳盡嘅一一啲資料嘅。咁至於咧就啊啊，我知道黃議員都好關注咧，就究竟係咪誒西九管理局一路做嘢，我哋土木工程拓展處都係冇監管嘅咧？其實我哋絕對咧就做好重視啊議員嘅意見，我哋咧亦都誒加強咗。

440
01:45:48,000 --> 01:46:08,010
講我哋對佢嘅監管噉就住過去誒六個月咧，我哋嘅同事其實都誒好努力咧，就話除咗做誒工作上嘅嘢咧，我哋儘量抽時間咧都落去地盤咧作啲監測。咁過去六個月咧，我哋去過誒西九管理局嘅地盤咧，都去咗七啊六次，就去咗十四次係突擊檢查嚟嘅。咁當中咧參與嘅人次咧。

441
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:28,020
就一百一七十七人次係去去做一啲噉嘅檢查。我哋當然啦，日常嘅誒管理工作咧，仍然係西九管理局要誒負責啦。但係我哋希望咧有我哋嘅參與咧，嗰個誒看質量啊、監管裏邊咧，大家都緊張啲，同埋咧可以睇得誒謹謹慎啲。誒，多謝主席。好，跟住係謝偉強議員。主席啊，主席，可唔可以？

442
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:58,770
誒喂喂！請個主席幫我嚟追咧，因為頭先嗰個比較複雜，涉及咁多個持份者，咁可唔可以請誒政府書面畀我嚟清晰知道邊個政府部門佢嘅監管嘅角色係點樣嗰個問責系統？因為而家涉及好多個部門嘅呢度，可唔可以請佢書面畀翻我哋？可以OK。同埋嗰個嘅誒breakdown咧。

443
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,990
六十億嗰度。

444
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:16,520
超過差唔多七十。

445
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:44,170
補充少少解釋嘅下個安排，唔該。

446
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,260
到嗰個嗰個需求嘅喺喺公共交通方面。

447
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:07,200
用咗個六十億係咪用曬？阿彭處長，係咪你答啊？

448
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:12,640
answer that? No, we haven't yet. We haven't we haven't spent all that money.

449
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:56,490
啊啊，邊位？誒，主席，或者我邀請啊，五生去解釋一下誒西九嗰度個交通設置啊、誒泊車安排啊、誒同埋係誒一啲旅遊巴停嘅地方。好啊。

450
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:18,780
就唔知點解喺文件裏邊冇嘅，而係投影片先有。誒點解委事務委員會我哋會唔知道？誒呢啲嘢喺文件嗰度，要嚟到開會先至知。O.K.好噉啊，秘書長，麻煩你將有關阿黃議員要求嗰啲資料手後畀我哋啊，唔該。跟住落嚟係請謝偉全議員。多謝主席。噉啊。

451
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:38,790
誒，梗係㗎啦，即係最近政府好多基建咧都出現誒超時、超支，甚至質量嘅問題，噉啊，大家都好關注。咁喺呢度咧，即係誒，希望咧，我相信亦都會咧，即係係有關誒西九呢方面啲工程嚟講咧，喺嗰個監管方面。

452
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:58,800
咧即係可以用到咧獨立專業人士，就唔係好似有啲噉樣維維維，大家自己都用個家。咁呢方面咧就希望係真係小心啦。噉我哋希望咧即係誒支持咗嗰個誒項目，尤其是使錢之後咧就唔會再出現咧又質量唔對板啊，或者超時超支。就呢樣嘢，我想問。

453
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:21,330
六十億到啦，係嘛？咁呢六十億個工程係咪誒已經做完咗？而嗰個數字嚟講咧，亦都係符合翻嗰陣時嘅估算，冇乜剩咧。包括嗰陣時嗰六啊億咧，大概係咪有冇嗰啲應急費用斜都用埋咧？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題咧，我想問咧，就係因為。

454
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:41,340
三田地庫咧，即係頭先解釋咗啦，即係係誒上邊都解釋咗，即係點解喺地庫咁呢個有個好處。咁但係另外咧，就係我就誒，因為將來咧我都關注咧誒咁多個文化或者戲曲中心啊，或者啲表演場所啊，到時咧即係好多時候咧。

455
01:48:41,340 --> 01:49:01,350
夜晚或者咩咧，即係好多表演咧，可能散場啊、開場啊，都係同時誒出現嘅。咁睇到咧就有呢啲誒誒旅遊泊位嘅車噉，但係因為尤其是散嘅時候咧，可能大家差唔多時間嘅咁呢個咧，我會擔心到時即係會唔會造成個交通問題或？

456
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:21,360
或者上落啊，即係喺度等人啊，有啲嗰啲誒旅遊巴嗰度咧，各方面可唔可以誒解釋一下嗰個處理？咁另外咧就將來咧嗰個誒管理嘅問題，因為你集中成個地庫，將來上邊有一啲係文化藝術嘅設施之外咧，亦都有啲誒商業嘅用。

457
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:41,370
用途啊，包括頭先講零售啊，或者甚至酒店啊等等嗰啲，噉啊呢方面咧嗰個管理方面，可唔可以講講咧點樣去個權責問題啦？因為呢啲係誒係共用啊嘛，我相信即係裏邊好多設施，包括泊位啊、停車場啊等等，咁誒另外有啲電梯啊等等，咁呢方面可以。

458
01:49:56,780 --> 01:50:16,790
吳生好誒喺呢個綜合地庫咧，特別喺呢個二區咧，就大約係有一千三百個誒停車位到啦私家車。咁coach parking咧誒旅遊巴咧都係有二十六個左有嘅。咁誒至於誒議員關心咧，就係話即係譬如散場嘅時候嗰個安排。咁其實除咗喺呢個誒。

459
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:36,810
地庫嘅停車兩旁咧係有依個，即係我哋所謂呢帶咧，可以拍到誒私家車啊、巴士誒旅遊車啊。其實喺翻誒柯士甸道咧，亦都係有一個二百米長嘅誒好長嘅呢帶咧，係可以拍到誒的士啊、旅遊車啊，誒可以係即係安排到咧誒唔同。

460
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:56,820
散場嘅觀眾羣咧係可以散嘅，咁亦都咧大家唔好忘記咧喺誒西九咧，其實我哋係連接咗三個鐵路站啦，包括咗喺東邊嘅柯士甸站、西面嘅九龍站以及咧係高鐵，咁所以中共嘅交通咧係非常之方便嘅，咁所以我相信喺個依一個安排咧係可以即係可以滿足。

461
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:34,560
噉係咪即係仲有政就喺呢度係即係其實政府就實報實銷啊？多謝主席啊，多謝議員嘅提問啊！我都想報告下咧，我哋誒講各區一啲進度啦。咁等誒議員都明白我哋而家個使錢嗰個情況。就住三A區咧，其實我哋最主要嚟講咧，就係去支援M家博誒個博物館啦。

462
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:54,680
咁嗰度咧，其實我哋咧所有嘅誒地下行車路嘅裝柱，我哋打曬㗎啦。而咧，我哋最緊張個機場快線隧道工程嘅保護工程咧，亦都已經做起曬㗎啦。咁而家餘下我哋仲爭啲咩未做咧？都係一啲柏油路誒去做翻條路面，同埋一啲機電嘅嘢。咁咧，整體嚟講咧，都係得啲好少嘅。

463
01:51:54,680 --> 01:52:14,690
數目亦都嗰啲咧，我哋係會有一啲招標價可以做參考，所以我係相信咧，我哋喺三A區裏邊咧係唔會超出我哋嘅預算嘅。咁當然啦，我哋都要到最尾結算嘅時候咧，我哋睇下可以剩翻幾多錢嘅。噉就住三B區咧，就係演藝綜合劇場嘅地庫嘅所在地啦。噉我都好高興同議員講咧，其實我哋嘅泥咧都挖到超。

464
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:36,820
嘅percent咁多嘅泥已經挖起咗㗎啦。如果地庫嘅挖掘咧，已經去到一半咁上下。主席，因為時間問題，我其他一個問題啫。如果有錢剩，係咪政府嘅就唔係西九嘅？多謝主席誒，多謝議員提問，係㗎。因為咧，所有嘅錢如果剩到咧，係我哋會翻翻去庫房嗰度嘅，亦都唔可以咧喺依一區裏邊咧拎去第二個區嗰度用嘅。誒，我亦都係翻。

465
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,740
噉我想問咧，就係。

466
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,740
誒嘅。

467
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:58,840
好合當啊！希望以後注意。

468
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:25,100
確咧，即係大家嗰個基礎係咪一樣嘅咧？呢個我想問嘅。

469
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:58,630
the the key issue is that by the time we approach Ledgeco for funding.

470
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:53,280
Acom sorry mods sorry mods, so they're not the same bridge. You can't compare the two, but.

471
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:13,860
噉我就好想問咧，未來即係如果你同樣呢個工程咁大筆費用係entrust，即係交託咗由西九管理局嘅。

472
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:44,510
The first bridge was designed by Wilkinson Eyre and was rejected by Lechko. We then went about and redesigned the bridge using, I think, Arabs, isn't it?

473
01:55:16,230 --> 01:55:33,520
嘅去執行嘅時候，點樣確保佢能夠呢啲錢係唔會造成一個奢華浪費咧？即係點樣去管理好呢個呢個噉嘅費用咧？多謝主席。好，啊，Donald。Let me just address the bridge issue. The um, there are two different bridges. They're not even the same design.

474
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:56,830
翻庫房嗰度，啊多謝主席。馬逢國議員，多謝主席。誒喺呢，我先提一提咧。頭先有啲有誒西九嘅朋友咧，講到立法會嘅時候咧，仍然用立法局呢個詞咧，我覺得真係不能接受嘅。即係回歸咗廿廿二年啦，啊，仲係用立法局咧，就即係似乎唔。

475
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:19,350
咁另外咧，我想問咧就係，即係而家啲地庫由政府，即係由西九去做曬啦。咁誒，將來有你未知道係邊個係發展商嘅，即係做嗰啲上蓋啊、酒店嗰啲。咁點樣確保到我哋嘅地庫係適合到佢哋將來嘅用途咧？因為未必未知邊個會中標啊！呢個呢個第一個問題啦，即係誒咁而。

476
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:39,360
第二個問題咧，即係我之前咧喺西九喺立法會辯論嘅時候咧，我都提過，應該係按一個四不嘅原則咧，就係不壓縮規模、不拖延進度、不退質素同埋不奢華浪費啦。咁而家拖延進度咧已經出現咗㗎啦，就係因為呢個高鐵噉，我哋有一定嘅拖延噉，但係呢個唔係西九管理局嘅責任啦。

477
01:53:41,020 --> 01:54:01,030
誒之前二零一四年政府即係嚟講嘅時候咧，就話二百三十億咧加埋曬。咁當時計嗰二百三十億係用二零一四年嘅當時嘅價值嚟去計啊，定係用咩價值去計咧？咁如果用嗰個計算咧，而家你誒唔係超好多，超咗五億啦嚇。咁到底啲你嗰個？

478
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:21,040
而家嗰個誒誒要嚟攞一百七十五億呢一個價值，又係幾時嘅價值咧？呢個係咪二零一九年嘅價值咧？咁呢個二零一四嘅二百三十億同二零一九嘅二百三十五億，即係加埋個六十億，咁中間有咩差別咧？係咪當時高估咗咧？定係而家係誒呢個先係準確？

479
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:15,230
OK。

480
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:31,130
咁誒，跟住落嚟啊，周浩鼎議員。

481
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:55,260
O.K.嗱，仲有兩位，我我其他嗰兩個問題冇回應，車位有幾多同埋？

482
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:22,030
嗱，仲有兩位誒委員咧，就排緊隊發言嘅，噉我都會畀翻。

483
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:28,670
捉時間，佢哋發現，所以咧，我延長嘅時間十五分鐘，咁咧就亦都冇第二輪發言啦。

484
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:49,560
And as I said, the funding that we've secured so far, for example, for the basement, we are not yet at the point where we've spent all that money because it's being so carefully controlled.

485
01:56:55,790 --> 01:57:12,680
點樣監督？誒，我可以打一打個車位嘅。咁喺整個頭先我都講過咧，喺二喺個松二裏邊咧個車位數量咧係大約誒一千三百個。咁而成個西九咧文化區裏邊咧就係有大約二千二百個車位。

486
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:17,060
We will have, as we have in this case, detailed design, which will have been fully costed by independent quantity surveyors. Those costs would have been checked and verified by CEDD, and all the way through, as my CEDD colleague has explained, they are checking us.

487
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:45,390
咁另外一個咧就係誒車位有幾多啦，即係我都想問一個好簡單數字。咁最後一個問題咧，我都想問咧，就係即係其實之前咧誒，我自己喺西九管理局嘅時候咧，就就住嗰個行人天橋咁咧誒。當時局裏邊討論嘅時候咧誒誒，管理層就話兩個設計。

488
01:54:45,390 --> 01:55:05,400
係基本上個價值係一樣嘅，即係佢需要嘅費用一樣。但係結果嚟到立法會嘅時候咧，嗰個出現嘅就受到挑戰嘅。咁最後咧就嗰個可以壓縮咗一億幾嘅。咁呢一個就誒，我問翻喺喺董事會啲問翻點解會出現噉嘅情況咧，都得唔到一個合理令我信服嘅解釋啦。

489
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:37,370
They have their own independent consultants that are advising them, and they check us, and we have our also separate independent quantity surveyors etc that are doing checking. There's multiple layers of verification to ensure that the funding is spent in accordance with the approved approval from the legislative council.

490
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:52,000
唔該啊，主席。噉就誒一百七十五億，當然絕對唔係一個細數目啦。咁當然我亦都瞭解到之前原來已經係即係大家明白係已經係有一個誒批准喺裏面。咁不過我就想誒問一問咧，嗱，因為我亦都留意到今次呢個綜合地庫咧，誒根據文件裏面亦都提供講。

491
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:12,010
都好清楚，由於部分嘅範圍咧，上個係攞嚟做酒店啦、主宅啦、住宅啦、辦公室啦，係由私人發展商去做嘅。咁亦都文件講得好清楚咧，啊，私人發展商係自己分擔翻佢嗰個部分嘅成本，噉係按照嗰個樓面面積咧去做翻一個分配啦。咁呢個係明白嘅，我主要。

492
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:32,020
都想問一問咧，就係話嗱，市民係好最擔心咧，就係超支，即係咁大筆嘅一百七十五億嘅款項嘅安排。今日係咁計，但唔知道去到何時何日，當你做完嘅時候，會唔會突然間又爆多十零廿億出嚟要畀？咁誒有一個監察咧，我唔知係咪可以做到嗱，私人發展商佢。

493
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:52,030
自己都孭緊佢嗰個成本去做佢哋嗰個部分嗰啲酒店啊、住宅㗎嘛，你哋會唔會喺呢啲工程一路進行嘅中期或者一啲階段性嘅時間咧，同翻立法會有啲交代一下？就係唔單止你哋自己嘅工程嗰個進行嘅使錢嘅進度，其實。

494
01:58:52,030 --> 01:59:12,040
如果私人發展商佢哋自己做，用咗幾多嘅成本或者階段性嘅情況，係咪都可以畀我哋掌握到咧？嗱，其實好老實講，如果喺嗰個過程裡面，私人發展商自己都發現有啲開始超支嘅問題，喂，噉我哋立法會都要先知先覺啊！

495
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:19,750
定係另一啲問題咧？

496
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:16,310
嘅協議嗰度，亦都會有相當嘅條款咧，係保障翻政府嘅利益嘅嚇。

497
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:57,940
誒第三期二零一八年一月咧就三十一億，咁今日你而家喺我哋眼前嘅文件即係一百七十五億。

498
02:01:39,330 --> 02:01:50,110
有一三年投嘅四點八億就係設計及工程計劃啦，呢個地庫跟住首二二期就二零一五年就廿九點二億。

499
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:32,050
早啲掌握到，因為佢都可能有啲問題招之，係咪同你哋有啲關係咧？或者係因為咩嘅因素？係咪因為有啲嘅因素，大家一齊會受到影響嘅？噉我哋都要早啲要掌握啊嘛。所以啊，我就想問下，係咪會有機會有呢啲噉樣嘅匯報嘅安排？係唔單止你哋，即西九管理局啊，而私人。

500
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:52,060
發展商嗰個嘅成本嘅情況，你哋有冇辦法都睇到下嘅咧？噉我就想問一問誒局方嗰個情況嘅，係唔該誒Duncan or，I think this is one for government to to answer. Okay，啊多謝周浩鼎議，其實咧誒，我哋政府咧都好緊張即係公堂嘅使用嘅，即係我。

501
01:59:52,060 --> 02:00:12,070
講咧，其實係我哋係誒政府入邊咧，同西九管理局咧係設立咗唔同級別嘅誒工作會議，亦都有個專責小組去睇嘅。咁亦都咧，我哋其實基本上咧係誒總部工程發展處，基本上每個月咧都問西九去攞個進度嘅。咁而西九入邊咧，佢有個叫做發展小組。

502
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:32,080
跌翻啱啱committee咧，要睇住佢硬件嘅進度。咁而我哋誒阿影女士作為我哋誒民政事務局嘅代表咧，其實亦都坐喺嗰個會度係睇住即係西九嗰個進度嘅。咁亦都咧，我諗誒，議員哋都知道咧，我哋呢個聯合小組咧，叫joint committee，係兩個月開始會。咁其實喺誒每年咧，我哋總有。

503
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:52,090
誒兩三次咧，係會向大家介紹嗰個硬件嘅進度嘅。咁另外咧，誒喺我哋同西九個所謂entrustment嗰個委託合約嗰度咧，其實我哋有啲有啲定一啲條款咧，係保障誒政府嘅利益嘅。譬如話，如果係有誒疑誤嘅時候咧，咁西九咧亦都係要誒。

504
02:00:52,090 --> 02:01:12,100
作出一個即係當然啦，西九亦都會誒向翻佢嘅承建商等等啦，就就追討翻咧，佢都有即係誒彌補翻我哋嘅損失嘅。噉我哋亦都係可以有個合約裏邊咧，亦都有啲誒糾紛嘅調解機制等等嘅。所以政府同西九個處理咧，亦都好似一般嘅一啲誒商業。

505
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:39,330
最後啊，陳志全議員係誒唔該，主席。主席我就做咗七年議員啦，即係今年第七年。我記得經我手咧誒批過嗱西九本身嗰個大嗰個建築費就係在上上兩屆嘅立法會係批嘅啦，就係二百一十六億。咁經我首批咧誒有。

506
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:18,230
其實我相信在座嘅委員咧，都好難喺政府提交畀我哋嘅文件裏邊咧，可以評價到究竟呢個一百七十五億係合理啊，係貴啊，定係可唔可以平啲啊？噉樣，我相信我哋未必有噉嘅能力喺咁簡單嘅文件嗰度可以處理得到。咁睇埋個投影片。

507
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:38,240
當然係多咗一啲數字，誒嗰一百四十億嘅分項，亦都有個百分比喺度。但係我都希望去到誒公務小組嘅時候咧，可以有更詳盡嘅分項，而且如果可以幫到我哋，即係而家你出去問捉住一個議員問究竟呢個價錢係合唔合理，我都唔敢答啊，因為上次嗰條天價天橋，我哋嘈一嘈又可以誒。

508
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:19,730
誒。

509
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:58,900
要做嘅面積咧，亦都係非常之大嘅。其實我哋要做嗰個建築樓面面積咧，係講緊成誒。

510
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:48,080
實係幾多錢嘅？咁至於大定細，我頭先就講過咧，呢個I即係呢個integrated basement嘅phase two咧，係等於十個香港大球場咁大嘅。咁至於個合理性，我就交畀阿彭女士、阿阿阿阿應女士講啊嚇。

511
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:54,490
到大家個大嘅圖像，所謂headline capture睇咗之後，然後先至咧逐步喺呢二百三十億裏邊係逐漸去攞嘅。因為你知大家攞嘅時候咧，政府係要做埋一個詳細嘅設計，先至夠膽話我究竟要攞幾多錢。

512
02:08:40,110 --> 02:08:57,530
咁而最遲咧，亦都要喺誒嘅嘅路段咧，要喺二零二七年先能夠落成嘅。任何嘅設施，佢要攞到嗰個使用許可咧，一定係要有道路係要提供到嘅。咁所以故此，音樂中心係最快咧，都係能夠先可以喺二零二七年落成嘅。

513
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:58,250
低咗三十個percent嘅嚇噉，我希望咧誒政府喺公佈嘅時候可以提供到畀我哋咧，就係首二期、第三期佢包括啲咩項目誒做起咗啲乜嘢啲錢點使個area即係個個面積係幾多？我哋都盡我哋嘅能力去理解。

514
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:18,260
解去，當你無論投票支持好、反對好，你都係要講到呢一百七十五億，究竟係咪一個係咪啱數？嚇呢個我覺得我哋議員都係有呢個責任，即係唔好話誒。而家洗濕咗個頭，你點都要畀㗎啦噉樣嚇噉。但係係咪可以平啲？而家我唔敢講嘅，即係話啊喂。

515
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:38,270
當然，我可以乜都唔做。誒，可唔可以平啲啊？上次你又可以平咗三成個percent喎，今次又冇得好似街市買餸咁平十個實得嘅，不如畀個discount啦噉樣。我今日都講唔講唔到呢樣嘢。我希望即係政府喺上公務嘅時候，真係可以畀啲唔單止係話畀我哋知，係幫助我哋去。

516
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:58,280
去有個表，可能比較簡單啲。每一期做咗啲乜，佢嘅錢係點樣，幫我哋去做一個對比。究竟而家如果計翻上兩次，究竟係咪又所有嘢又貴咗啊？噉樣而家就咁睇，你講地基、基本地庫結構、行車路嘅分佈嗰一百四十億，我哋評評價唔到嘅。誒，另外我想了解多。

517
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:18,290
多啲咧，就係我睇翻文件嘅第四段，就話管理局將會優先推展位於二B、C區嘅音樂中心，並預計喺一二二七、二八年落成。其實點解要去到咁咁遲先至？而今年一九啦，二七、二八年先至落成，係咪都係關個地庫嘅問題？

518
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:40,750
啊，李處長。啊，首先咧啊，因為頭先可能其實我開場白解釋呢個呢啲嘅，不過可能阿陳議員嗰時唔喺度，因為點解我完全明白陳議員講乜嘅？因為我嚟咗個八個月啦嚇，我當初都覺得哇好多數字啊，咁咧我追完之後咧，我會解釋畀你聽咧。其實嗰二百一十六億咧，大家要明白喺二零零八年條條例過咗冇。

519
02:04:40,750 --> 02:05:00,760
攞就攞咗喺二百一十六億攞嘅時候咧，其實係未有個設計出現嘅。嗰而所以，如果二百一十六億嗰陣時咧，係估計佢啲文化設施要嘅。嗰嗰陣時咧誒係冇呢個噉嘅地庫誒地下綜合嘅地庫嗰個概念嘅。呢個綜合地庫，正如我想講咧，係喺二零零九。

520
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:20,770
至二零一一年嗰個諮詢期間先話啊，我哋攞Four Star Partners嘅城市中的公園個概念嘅，所以諗下零八年攞二百一十六億，零九至一一年嘅諮詢先走咗呢個綜合地庫出嚟嘅，咁所以咧大家要將呢二百一十六億同個綜合地庫嘅錢係分開兩橛嚟睇嘅，咁跟住去到綜合地庫你。

521
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:40,780
非常好好啊！即係做咗啲即係資料嘅蒐集，冇錯。喺一五一八年咧，你係批個大概總數係六十億㗎。但係喺嗰陣時，因為政府係一個坦希望係即係坦白透明咧，所以二零一四年咧已經講話，如果我哋起呢個綜合地庫咧，粗略估算，我重複係粗略估算嗰陣時咧，係總體需要二百三十億。即係其實畀。

522
02:05:54,770 --> 02:06:14,780
咁於是咧係分階段去做個詳細節計，咁一五年攞咗二十七點二啦，一八年嘅就分別攞咗三十八三十一點八億去做三A三B餘下工程，然後咧再係攞咗一啲兩兩億咧係做一啲誒誒勘測嘅嘢嘅，咁所以而家就剩翻呢個二A嘅綜合地庫再攞錢啦，咁所以應該睇咧。

523
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:34,790
係二百粗略估算二百三十億，再減咗頭先嗰六十億，剩翻呢一橛。咁所以咧，而頭先咧誒阿彭女士都講咗咧，點解其實係一個後來有少少嘅誒誒差幾億咧？原因就係因為當你做到好詳細嘅估算嘅時候咧，咁咧就會即係總會有啲誒做到詳細設計，你先知道確。

524
02:06:49,990 --> 02:07:10,000
即係我講一講啦，其實誒雖然銀碼大，其實咧就係工程所牽涉嘅嘅種類咧係唔繁複嘅。即係我哋好簡單，係要打地樁，跟住咧就要掘到去即係誒誒地庫第二層啦，噉啊掘泥，噉啊運泥出去，咁呢啲亦都係大家好容易理解。跟住就好似阿。

525
02:11:14,290 --> 02:11:16,110
響落車上落。

526
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:46,780
都係實用，但係。

527
02:11:57,510 --> 02:12:01,200
咁始終咧，如果有啲活動，有一啲噉嘅擺設咧。

528
02:11:37,230 --> 02:11:41,450
個人表演咧都冇乜場地嘅，響街啊～

529
02:10:47,130 --> 02:10:53,360
可唔可以更加令到佢更加善用佢咧嚇？咁誒？

530
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:26,500
係交代埋呢一啲過去嘅嗰個歷史，等大家可以一目瞭然明白到嗰個數字嘅。咁衷心感激各位議員今日畀我哋嘅建議。

531
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:36,730
我我哋一路都覺得誒，即係公務員係係精英嚟嘅，咁亦都好專業嘅。咁但係有好多數字上邊嘅嘢咧。

532
02:09:57,020 --> 02:10:09,080
工程咧就可以進行嘅。不過我我我有少少意見咧，我都想講，因為正話好多啊啊議員咧都提到地下個空間，其實我講咗好多年咧，即係香港土地。

533
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:15,750
即係大家睇落去都舒服啲，唔係淨係睇四捧場嚇。依個我少少意見。咁今日咧就誒冇其他事項㗎啦。不過今日誒，因為依個誒。

534
02:10:29,370 --> 02:10:44,490
咧，噉啊嗱，而家依個西九底下嗰個啊地底咧，就係用嚟做交通啊，等等其他嘅嘢啦。噉我就覺得咧，如果淨係啊公共交通或者係想落車泊車噉樣樣咧，

535
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:57,220
當然，我唔係講話淨係響誒某一啲地方響街頭唱歌嗰啲啦。即係我我都希望咧，即係可以去考慮一下，唔係淨係咁咁緊堵噉樣去做停車場啊、巴士上落嚇。咁依個係我少少嘅意見。

536
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:30,010
誒彭處長所講啦，我哋咧就係板鐵石屎落石屎嘅啫，做一個石屎廊，跟住咧就起嗰條誒嘅誒誒地下行車路。咁呢啲咧其實咧喺我誒即係我自己都係做開工程出身啦。其實工程嚟講咧，依個係唔複雜嚟嘅。咁亦都喺個預價裏邊咧，佢哋都能夠參考到。

537
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:50,020
之前做三A三B喺翻同一個嘅工作環境情況底下，噉嘅誒誒承建商所落嘅標價咧，係在在做呢個第二區呢個嘅評評價嘅。咁所以其實呢個一百七十五億咧，係啱啱好似阿誒誒秘書長所講啦，誒銀碼係大，但係其實我哋。

538
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:19,190
二十誒二十幾萬平方米嘅樓面誒建築樓面面積嘅係非常之大嘅。咁所以嚟講咧，就啱啱都講過工程本身咧係唔複雜，只係因為我哋面積大同埋做嘅時間比較長咧，所以咧係需要咁大嘅費用嚟嘅。咁而

539
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:40,110
啱啱亦都有問到點解係誒音樂中心咧係需要大係預計二零二七或者二八年先能夠落成咧？亦都係要配合翻誒地庫依一個建築工程嘅。咁啱啱嗱，其實地庫嘅建築工程咧，我哋都希望能夠盡快完成。咁最快嚟講咧，應該可以首階段咧喺二零二五年落成。

540
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:18,050
係，秘書長。我最後想講一句係誒，衷心感激各位議員今日嘅發言嘅，因為誒我諗我哋希望份文件儘量簡短，但係都明白好多數字。咁喺我哋做公務工程嗰份文件嘅時候咧，會因為頭先阿陳議員問嘅問題咧，都有一兩位議員係問過，噉我哋會誒順便儘量。

541
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:57,020
你要畀多啲資料我哋去了解同埋分析，咁咧就啊，即係話聽啊陳議員啊要求你哋提供嗰啲數字咧，佢哋希望響啊公務小組或者財委會咧，都可都可以盡早去啊批，即係批准依啲依啲撥款，噉啊等有關嘅公

542
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:29,370
唔多，噉我哋最好咧就係善用我哋個地下空間。噉啊，即係我哋去啊好多唔同嘅地方啦，特別日本啦睇到啦，佢哋用好多地下嘅空間咧，就啊用嚟做唔同嘅用途嘅。咁有商場啦，或者一啲其他嘅設施啦。

543
02:10:54,280 --> 02:11:14,290
當然啦，喺個成本嚟講咧，你挖得越深，呢個成本越高嘅，有可能啊，未必一定咁花算。但係如果你而家唔做咧，以後就冇得做㗎啦嚇。咁所以咧，我都希望咧係咪話啊可以啊喺底下一啲啊一啲畀人用，一啲畀車用。

544
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:37,220
側邊啲空位嗰度啊，做一啲可以畀呢啲藝術家要嚟做一啲擺設啊，或者展覽啊，啊，即係或者有啲有啲商鋪啊，或者有一啲小型嘅表演，誒，即係表演嘅場地。因為正話咧，有有講到啦，即係而而家有啲藝術家個人。

545
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:09,570
O.K.噉就。

546
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:13,550
啊！我而家宣佈啊，散會。多謝各位。

547
02:12:52,750 --> 02:13:03,460
空間發展嘅最新進展，同埋啊第二個項目咧，就係西九文化區與鄰近地區嘅融合同埋連接。

548
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:32,340
討論嘅議題咧，啊，我哋我亦都聽到大家委員個意見咧，係支持嘅。噉我哋就會誒將有關嘅議題咧，就誒支持交去公務小組同埋財委會咧去處理啦。咁誒依個。

549
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:52,750
議程就到此為止，噉就誒有冇其他事項？委員想提出冇，咁咧就下一次嘅會議咧就將會係響三月二十二號星期五上晝嘅八點半至十點半舉行。咁討論嘅事項咧有兩個，第一個咧就係藝術公園及自由空。
