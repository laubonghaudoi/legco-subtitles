1
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,290
我哋繼續F.C.L.二零一八一九七廿三文件。

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,650
第八十四條有關係，有直接金錢利益之下表決嘅規定。

3
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,240
誒，我係非常支持律政司咧，係要請多啲人馬嘅。

4
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:44,830
係喺律政司、民政法律科同埋法律草兒科咧，講開設一個首席政府律師上下職位。

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:53,140
以便咧能夠有效應付，因應該兩個科現有嘅同埋新展開嘅工作，大幅增加工作量。

6
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,790
人事編組編制小組委員會咧審議上述嘅建議，係大概兩個鐘頭啦。政府當局如果提交咗多份資料文件。

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:37,300
係請本委員會咧通過人事編制小組委員會喺二零一八年十月十九號就依C二零一八一九十七號文件初提嘅建議。

8
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:26,520
主席，我發言咧係支持律政司民事法律科同埋法律草擬科各開設一個首席嘅政府律師上額嘅職位。

9
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:16,110
上次我哋財委會用到一小時廿五分鐘討論上述嘅建議㗎，同埋喺解答大家問題咧，我哋有律政司政務專員蕭餘斌先生同埋政府嘅團隊啊。咁而家第一位發問嘅就梁美芬議員，係五分鐘。

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,010
二咧將於下午七時結束，有需要咧我會最多延長會議十五分鐘。提醒委員咧，假如今天咧委員有就會議事宜有直接或者間接金錢利益嘅話咧，請委員按照議事規則第八三幾條規定，就該事宜擺嚟之前咧披露有關利益性質。亦都請委員注意咧議事規則。

11
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:51,530
啊，我覺得咧喺香港啊，回歸之後二十一年咧，誒香港確實咧亦都多咗好多法律嘅問題，亦都因應有唔同嘅啊法律嘅發展，我哋又要制定誒唔同嘅法例。咁而誒正係喺我哋喺近年嚟。

12
00:01:51,530 --> 00:02:11,540
誒一啲所謂嘅誒候型申請嘅個案，亦都即係除咗法庭都已經係誒叫苦啦嚇，唔夠人咧。我相信即係律政司其實係應該咧，係更加即係能夠請到人係聚焦去協助舒緩嗰種案件嘅積壓。噉你哋。

13
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:31,550
如果係誒喺無論立例，係因為呢個咧，我喺司法委員會都可能會邀請律政師上嚟講啦。但係即係話誒，其實誒中審法院大法官都開咗聲，即係話希望律政師都要研究下法例上誒能唔能夠協助到，唔好造成咁大嘅案件積壓等等咧。

14
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:51,640
我認為咧，根本開設呢兩個職位咧就刻不容緩。其實我就即係認為可能係唔足夠添。不過咧，係比率政司回應我嘅時候就講解下，係咪真係呢兩個職位就已經足夠，需唔需要一啲係其實仲有一啲相關嘅應該要誒增設咧？噉樣可以具體啲回應我。

15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:11,650
哇！蕭餘斌先生係啊，主席，多謝議員嘅提問。誒，我哋誒首先係多謝議員支持我哋咧，係開設誒依個建議嘅職位。噉我哋誒律政司一向所採取嘅態度咧，就係話我哋開設新嘅職位嘅時候咧，我哋係用好嚴謹嘅方式咧，係去睇咗誒嗰個工作量嗰個。

16
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:31,660
增加以至複雜性啊！我哋係真係睇到嗰個需要，而我哋都係經過咗我哋內部人手調配各方面咧，認為咧係的確有確實嘅需要咧。噉我哋先提出咧係呢個增加誒人手嘅需求。咁當然咧，我哋係亦都係誒曾經咧係增加過一啲咧係呢個非首長級。

17
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,180
誒。

18
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,960
係邊位得？

19
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,810
誒提問，誒張錦維律師嚇。

20
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,350
屋組係去處理嘅咧，因為我想知道呢一啲增加嘅工作量係點樣具體分佈喺唔同嘅組別裏邊。

21
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:19,900
嘅工作啦，當其時律政司方面畀我答覆咧，就話呢啲案件咧係由城市規劃地政。

22
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:51,890
係講三四成，第二次講你哋可以翻聽翻錄音嘅，我有翻聽翻。第二次咧就講三至四個percent，兩者相差係非常之大。咁所以我想今次問清楚，我想核實。

23
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:51,670
嘅人手咧係誒支持我哋呢方面嘅工作嘅，咁但係我哋睇到咧，我哋而家建議依個兩個職位咧，佢依個首席依個政府律師嗰個層次咧，係自一九八零年以來咧誒年代以來咧都係未調整過嘅，咁所以我哋覺得咧，而家我哋係睇到嗰個工作量嗰個持續增。

24
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:11,680
加個複雜性亦都係持續咁增加咧，咁所以喺呢方面咧，我哋認為咧係需要咧係增加呢兩個職位。係主席，即係我我就誒建議誒律政司認真翻去咧，亦都誒考慮可以誒聘請一啲可能未必去到首席嘅嗱原因咧，我知道咧即係誒。

25
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:31,690
其實要培養一個法律嘅專才喺律政司自己都需要時間嘅，咁所以你哋應該咧係要勇於咧要諗下你成個編制，譬如三年之後你可以有啲乜嘢係比較有經驗嘅，喺入咗去個部門唔一定即刻就可以去獨當一面㗎。我而家好明白案件嘅複雜性，你哋根本就唔。

26
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:51,700
唔係好夠人，噉我覺得你喺各大院校啊誒誒喺畢業誒同埋即係一啲你覺得適合嘅唔同級別咯，即係唔係話一定要到首席噉你先可以栽培到個階梯咧，係應接將來嘅一個誒誒嗰個嘅法律成個法。

27
00:04:51,700 --> 00:05:11,710
律改革嘅需要，噉我當然要申報啦。我係三大法學院裏邊其中一間係教書㗎，咁但係呢個咧同嗰個係冇關嘅。我係好希望你哋嗰個司法誒律政司嗰邊咧係救人，係有經驗嘅人。而家我係我哋有啲人嘅印象就係經驗唔夠咯，有時好冇啊？早啲吸納培養嘅時間。

28
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:31,720
要多少少先至出嚟，再處理個案件咧，你哋會順暢好多咯嚇。好，主席，我呢個係一個評價，或者睇下律政司有冇回應啊。好啊，阿阿專員有冇回應？係主席，多謝議員個建議啊！我哋係會係做好我哋嗰個內部嗰個培訓工作咧，等到我哋一啲係年青新加入嘅律師咧。

29
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:51,730
係可以咧，係得到咧係適當嘅培訓咧，係逐步咧係晉升到咧係呢個首長級嘅職位。嗯，範國威議員係四分鐘。好啊，今次我第二輪提問咧，就想跟進翻我第一輪嗰陣時問過有關民事法律科工作量嗰個嘅分佈嘅。誒特別係政府畀我哋嘅文件第四頁。

30
00:05:51,730 --> 00:06:11,740
嗰度講就話誒每年需要負責即係誒仲喺度進行緊嘅司法複核嘅案件嘅宗數，咁嗰陣時我希望有個清楚嘅圖像，瞭解到底喺民業民事訴訟組裏邊要加設呢個常額嘅政府律師職位。咁上次誒我問咧，當然就涉及到城規會嗰啲司法複核。

31
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,890
哦。

32
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,440
嗱，而家咧就有誒。

33
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,200
咧就會係誒由誒。

34
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,310
啊！呢個規劃環境地政房屋組嗰邊去處理嘅。

35
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,760
係咧，一千一百四十三宗，大約係有幾多個百分比係？

36
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:53,170
表面上有三位，其實得一位在席嘅周浩鼎議員啦。噉我呼籲大樓嘅議員咧，盡快落嚟，我好快都要表決呢個項目啦。嚇，周浩鼎議員五分鐘。

37
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:11,970
事翻嚟有二十六段又咁寫咧，會唔會你哋對於虛擬貨幣嘅監管已經有一套即係誒相關嘅法例立法監管嘅時間表？因為目前據我哋瞭解係未有一套完整嘅法規咧去監管呢個虛擬貨幣嘅。噉我淨係想問下呢個問題啫。唔該，主席。

38
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:45,450
訴訟，所以係個歸納咧，係呢一個比較係有個特別嘅。即係民事訴訟組一，而家要去處理嗰個即係誒，舉例一七年個一九八零三宗嗰個佔嘅宗數同埋百分比嘅比例係高過要處理規劃環境地政組係去處理嘅。誒。

39
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:40,280
房屋組咧係去處理，就唔係由今次誒需要新開設呢個嘅民事訴訟組一係去處理嘅。咁嗰陣時，我仲得到咧就話，當我問誒城規會司法複核嗰陣時，佔所有司法複核嘅總數幾幾多嗰陣時咧，我就好有趣地咧聽到兩個唔同嘅答案。第一次講咧就。

40
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:12,180
第四頁表格裏邊講嘅，仲喺度處理緊嘅司法複核嘅宗數，二零一七年嘅九百零三宗裏邊，到底有幾多宗？有百分之幾係今次需要加開呢個民事訴訟組一係要去處理嘅咧？而又有幾多宗百分之幾咧？係由呢個規劃地政房？

41
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:46,470
多謝誒，議員再有一次機會畀我，或者去清楚解釋下咧工作嗰個分佈。就住城規會嗰方面嘅工作，包括係提誒提供意見同埋訴訟咧，係喺我哋嘅規劃環境地政房屋組嗰度處理。咁呢個係喺附件嘅誒誒文件嘅附件。

42
00:07:46,470 --> 00:08:06,480
裏邊亦都係顯示到呢一組嘅誒工作嘅性質係點樣樣誒喺訴訟組裏邊係處理呢方面嘅城規會嘅工作。上次嘅數咧，我可以誒誒確定咧係司法複核方面咧，大概係有四個percent。唔好意思，我嘅誒出錯咗。上次睇嗰個數係誒唔係。

43
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:26,490
四成係四個percent嘅咁誒嗰個工作噉嘅分配就係純粹因為嗰個類別點解唔係喺誒我哋而家誒傾緊嘅訴訟組裏邊負責咧？因為嗰個類別係誒關於嗰方面地政嘅係誒城規嘅工作，所以係要有專家嘅同事咧，係特別去處理呢方面嘅誒。

44
00:08:46,340 --> 00:09:06,350
嗰個九百零三嗰個數，或者係去到今年，其實已經係去到一千四百多宗個數咧，係裏邊係包括咗誒城規嗰方面嘅誒司法複核案件，其實係所有司法複核案件裏邊嘅嘅總嘅總數嚟嘅。咁今次呢一個嘅民事訴訟組一要去處理嘅係。

45
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:32,890
誒唔好意思，或者誒我請我同事方面補充下個詳細嘅資料。係啊，黃華怡女士。係多謝議員提問。誒個答案應該大概係誒一成到嘅，有九成咧就係誒而家我哋將會開設嘅誒首席政府律師，即係其中一位咧係會處理嘅。咁大概係有誒一成到咧。

46
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,400
嗯。

47
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,240
邊位答？

48
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,520
係，係啊。

49
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
Miss Thomson。

50
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,590
噉我想問下咧，就誒。

51
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,070
好，我黃碧雲議員五分鐘。

52
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,400
誒副法律草擬專員去做嘅咧。

53
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,830
阿阿朱聯，你答定邊啊？

54
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,940
誒主席就誒。

55
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,890
I thank the member for this for this question.

56
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,410
佢嘅工作就主要係負責誒，即係啲獨立。

57
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,870
究竟呢一個新增嘅一名副法律草擬專員咧？

58
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,290
expect into the future seeing drafting instructions provided to the law drafting division.

59
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:07,910
我想問咧，就係誒而家開呢個會咧，其中一個最重大工作就係嗰個法律嘅草擬啦。

60
00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:13,460
誒唔該，主席啊，我都係支持開設呢個位置嘅，因為都睇到過去咧誒，無論係訴訟嘅數目或者係處理嘅工作咧，都的確越嚟越繁多。咁呢個我會支持嘅。不過有一個小問題想請教下咧，就係我睇到今次嘅文件二十六段咧，特別係提到啊，由於咧我哋應對。

61
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:33,470
呢一個金融同商業領域課題嘅法律問題越嚟越複雜，亦都係全球趨勢啦。咁有需要咧，係增加一名副法律嘅草擬資源啦。誒等等啦。咁誒特別係提到嚟話打擊洗黑錢啊，或者係打擊個恐怖分子資金籌集等等嘅事宜嘅。我想就呢個問。

62
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:53,480
問題問一問咧，就係因為最近亦都誒有呢個虛擬貨幣嘅興起啦。咁虛擬貨幣咧，誒透過呢種嘅運作係可以做好多嘅啊，即係可能犯罪嘅活動或者洗黑錢都可以，亦都係好多惡片係透過虛擬貨幣去做。我想問下，既然律政司打算係再請誒新嘅同。

63
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:45,320
When it comes to issues like cryptocurrency, it's a matter of the relevant bureau forming policy, and then that policy being something that's passed in the form of drafting instructions to the law drafting division. So I think it forms just one of many areas of complexity that we would.

64
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,730
Miss Johnson。

65
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,960
我感謝成員 for this question.

66
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,740
立法，但。

67
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,270
effectively the drafting area where it will be personal drafting of particular.

68
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,660
律法 drafting division with that particular area of responsibility, so

69
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:07,150
The duties of the proposed role will reflect the same generic duties as apply for the two existing deputy lord draughtsmen. They will cover two areas.

70
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:51,400
就係話誒嚟緊《基本法》二十三條立法嗰個國家安全法嘅本地立法草擬，係咪會包括埋喺而家新開嘅呢一個職位裏邊，要求呢一位同事係負責支援嘅咧，或者領導嘅咧？

71
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:13,330
as regards the issue raised by the member, the government's position has already been clearly set out by the chief executive and by the constitutional and mainlands affairs bureau on various occasions. If members have specific views about certain issues relating to

72
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:42,700
獨立地負責一啲重大嘅立法項目嘅草擬工作啦。咁呢個係第二十六段所講。噉啊，我知道之前都有議員追問過，就係誒，我哋比較關心政府而家手頭上有啲乜嘢好重大嘅立法項目係必須要加一個誒。

73
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:36,370
probably more prominently the supervisory role in relation to the work of a particular subdivision within the law drafting division, in terms of providing guidance to the drafters in that subdivision, and constantly reviewing the legislation that is being prepared. So

74
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:56,380
ensuring the quality of the legislation prepared within Subdivision Three, that would be the intention. The other aspects for which the third Deputy Law Draftsman would be responsible relate very much to the strategic and operational aspects of the Law Drafting Division, and in that regard.

75
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:16,390
Our paper mentions the Camera Ready project that is being proposed. This is something that the third deputy law draftsman would lead that particular project. What we are looking for is to ensure that the effectiveness and efficiency of the law drafting division is kept up to standard.

76
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:36,400
啊！主席，我剛才問就係話政府啊，係咪手頭上邊已經有一係列嘅重大嘅法律係準備係要草擬嘅？噉啊，但係我唔係好聽得清楚，即係剛才嗰個答冇有答到，或者我比較誒再集中啲問啦。

77
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,600
to miss。

78
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,550
嗱。

79
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,420
浙江省。

80
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,160
係咪噉樣樣咧？

81
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,950
咁諗啦嚇，啊！

82
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,000
人哋邊度有口？喂，阿主席，我可以講未啦？

83
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,540
上個禮拜答咗啦，大家可以睇翻嗱嗱。

84
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,430
If you Miss Joseph, if you can tell me what future,

85
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,360
You you can do it again. Sorry, um, two two questions.

86
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,350
我 want to address this question.

87
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:32,390
嗯，no，I'm not going to repeat this question because I I think Claudia you will have a chance to to ask this question again.

88
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:39,330
嗱，大家嗱，大家好簡單嘅啫，你哋可以睇翻啲大嚇，因為我就聽住，我就聽到佢筆試嚇。嗱，你哋你哋翻去睇個大先。

89
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:15,720
嗱，各位同事，嗱，你哋噉樣講好唔公道，你自己又唔去又唔去睇底，主席又坐喺度聽咁多嘢，你起碼去睇完先話陳建波唔啱啦，唔該你做咗呢樣嘢先。嗱，如果唔係，唔好去圈話嚇。阿梁繼昌，係。

90
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:54,750
年有幾多條重大嘅法律比較複雜，需要增加人手，你先至嚟呢度財委會話開會嘅咩？你而家叫我翻翻轉頭去逐個局問啊？係咪去問林鄭月娥？係咪打算做二十三條立法？

91
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:55,110
嗱，各位同事，大家鎮定啲。嗱，聽我講，你哋咧，你哋而家可以隨時出去睇翻帶嘅。而家咧，我而家就係要繼續我哋嘅問題，好唔好？噉你啱再翻嚟啊！下一位咧就係梁繼昌議員，梁繼昌議員係五分鐘，梁繼昌議員。

92
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:33,620
that issue, then they should be addressed to the policy bureau. There's not a link between the proposal to create this role, which is very much required because of a general increase in the workload, both in terms of volume and complexity of the legislation being required from the

93
00:15:40,160 --> 00:16:00,170
If we look at the trends that are set out in the paper at paragraphs twenty three and twenty eight, there are very clear statistics about the increasing volume and the increasing workload of the law drafting division. Generally, law drafting division has been trying to absorb that additional workload, but that's no longer sustainable.

94
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:20,180
and the creation of the proposed post will enable the drafting work, the quality assurance work that I mentioned earlier, the training and other work of the existing two deputy law draughtsmen to be shared across three law draughtsmen.主席，我我唔知點解誒誒，我得唔到。

95
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:40,190
我想要嘅答案係咪政府唔想唔想答啊？定係點啊？你叫我去問翻逐個局，誒，佢哋有啲咩條例而家準備係要呢個同事幫手嘅？喂，如果你叫我逐個去問嗰個局，噉我哋呢個會都可以中止㗎咯喎，係咪啊？唔係政府已經知道手頭上面嚟緊嗰幾？

96
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:18,550
好啊，時間夠啦。不過我想提一提大家咧，上個禮拜都係有位委員不斷追問，而且問得好清楚啊。問你而家係咪為咗二十三條立法而要加人咧？噉我哋見到好少見啲政府部門咁清楚，話畀佢聽不是。好可惜咧，佢做咗不是咧，嗰個嗰個委員都繼續追問你係你係你係噉樣。我諗有冇噉嘅需要咧？我諗大家繼續諗。

97
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,490
啊！

98
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,270
Miss Thompson please.

99
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,590
但，我 must say。

100
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,520
start off with you know the drafting in English, of course.

101
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,720
There is the occupational retirement schemes amendment bill, which will update.

102
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:35,370
我感謝成員 for this question. If I could highlight the future legislative projects that are not mentioned in the paper.

103
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,940
The ones that I am at liberty to speak about, because the the government has already publicly announced them. There are those.

104
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,500
and these are in addition to the trade single window project that is mentioned in the paper and the corporate rescue bill that's highlighted in the paper as well.

105
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:31,500
The ordinance to enhance the powers of the registrar to ensure that the schemes are in fact genuine employment-based retirement schemes, and to improve the governance of occupational retirement schemes.

106
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:55,440
Legislation is in the pipeline because you can't guess what what the bureau will you know table or or give instruction to to your department. Can you tell us currently what?

107
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:24,850
And of course, I I I expect that you must feel the pressure, or there must be a morale issue of your team if you are going to ask for extra pairs of hands.

108
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:06,140
The Chinese translation of these laws are very poorly done, and as a very experienced member in handling bills of various types.

109
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:11,600
Big chunks of legislation is your division undertaking at the moment. I want to know what kind of you know complexity you've been facing in drafting these legislations. I mean, what what big and complicated legislations are are you undertaking at the moment?

110
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm I'm unable to comprehend the Chinese translation of these bills. Although I mean your English work is of a very quality standard, but your the the Chinese translation of these bills is incomprehensible. And how are you going to fix this problem, Ms. Johnson?

111
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:12,520
但， there are for example items on the public legislative programme for the second half of the 2018-2019 year, including bills such as the medical devices bill, which will regulate the supply of medical devices in Hong Kong through pre-market and post-market control.

112
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:45,140
And secondly, I would like to know, is Chinese language a prerequisite for the for these positions? Because as I understand it, of course, you you are drafting the laws based on on the common law precedents of some other countries sometimes, and and of course you.

113
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,300
Thank you.

114
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,820
嗯， and.

115
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,960
好下一位，陳志全議員。

116
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,140
to improve the situation with owners' corporations.

117
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,430
我會 have to say that I think the corporate rescue bill is exceptionally complex.

118
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,740
which are the more complicated and convoluted, you know, pieces of legislation, Ms Johnson.

119
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:19,190
律法 drafting division puts a very high priority in doing all that we can to ensure that the Chinese version.

120
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:11,800
How about my second question about the Chinese language translation? Yes, thank you. In terms of bilingual legislation.

121
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:09,380
The trade single window bill also falls into that category because of the nature of the matters that those bills and projects will cover.

122
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:01,440
especially for issuing insurance-linked securities in Hong Kong, I think the like the subject matters that I'm talking about there, are indeed complex.

123
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:43,930
Mr. Johnson, can you highlight any of those legislation which you think conceptually and technically are more difficult to deal with? I don't want a list of these shopping list of legislation, but in your view.

124
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:36,660
of the language, and we're not talking just about a translation, but in effect, something that is legislation of itself is of a higher standard. We continue to explore options that are available in order to come up with something that is, in fact, of the highest standard.

125
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:27,090
但係， in terms of other legislation that's not mentioned in the paper that the government has committed to introducing, I would have to say that the building management amendment bill falls into that category in terms of seeking to keep pace with the changes in that particular subject area and

126
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:50,560
我們有 announced policies that have been included, for example, in the CE's policy address and the policy agenda, which deal with the introduction of limited partnership regimes for private equity funds, and also the formation of special purpose financial vehicles.

127
00:23:40,290 --> 00:24:00,300
係係主席嗱，上個禮拜尾段咧，我都有喺度去提問。我的而且確咧就收唔到啊。主席，你頭先話阿法律草業專員咁斬釘截鐵咁清楚答我哋。咁當然，我而家希望我嘅提問可以問得更好，誒，專員答得更好，令到。

128
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:20,310
同事係收到呢個信息，有無謂話咩？大家去睇底啦，噉係咪要停咗個項目去去睇底咧？咁嗱，上次會議係有唔少議員咧，係問到新開設呢個常額副法律草擬專員係咪負責敏感而又重大嘅法例，包括廿三條嘅立法嘅？我覺得。

129
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,510
Miss Johnson。

130
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,020
擔心呢樣嘢，唔該，主席。

131
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,870
發發項目嘅草擬。

132
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,980
會唔會考慮？

133
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,250
when we're talking about drafting services.

134
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,320
This is a generic requirement across the existing two.

135
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,100
deputy lord raftsman, there is no intention that this

136
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,590
和一 deputy lord drafterman performing personally drafting services.

137
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:51,020
This is for the most complex and for the most sensitive legislation.

138
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:06,300
喺呢個副法律草擬專員嘅職責之中列明係唔會負責廿三條，咁呢個最清楚啦。如果你草精都講埋呢次，佢哋唔會再追問啦，或者承諾。

139
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:33,840
嘅立法項目嘅草擬工作係唔係今日開始呢個副法律草擬專員係要負責咧？噉樣嗱，如果當局想去釐清呢樣嘢，想我哋支持嚇呢個位，我建議有幾個方法嘅。

140
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:18,700
唔係好多，佢都係視為重大議題，係要法律草擬即係科去專項噉樣去負責，咁牽涉到廿三條係好多條法例嘅修改，點會唔係重大議題咧？即係負責重大。

141
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:40,320
得上個禮拜咧，政府係冇好肯定一句，好似頭先主席你噉樣講咧，去回答嘅。但係如果我睇翻文件，我去理解咧，我真係會有呢個憂慮。喺第廿六段講到，實有必要增加一名副法律草擬專員，獨立負責重大。

142
00:24:42,150 --> 00:25:02,160
第廿七段咧就提到，過去法律草擬科負責至少兩項重大議題，即財政預算案及税務相關措施，以及為國歌法進行本地立法。大家可以睇到國歌法咧，列德權局長都話國歌法係相對簡單嘅法例嚟嘅，即頁數都唔。

143
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:54,130
啊！包括將呢個位改為偏外啦，偏外就真係做你講得出嗰啲，就淨係做嗰啲。又或者咧，為將來廿三條立法咧，另外開一個又開一個位，係專為廿三條嘅草擬立法嘅嗱。我知道政府答咗答過好多次，但係今次你可唔可以話畀我聽？

144
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:26,590
未來會另外開，如果將來為廿三條立法係會另外開設一個職位去去做呢樣嘢，係會會去做廿三條咧，咁可以釋除我哋疑慮嚇。就算話今日你冇呢個plan，但係唔代表呢，我哋今日開咗呢個位，他招佢會畀政府塞埋呢個工作落去，即係大家議員係。

145
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,950
嚇政策嗰一啲係立法嘅原因。

146
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,230
The law drafting division has tried to absorb the additional workload.

147
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,920
and again, I point back to those statistics that are set out in the the paper.

148
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,950
all of the legislation that is required within the government's legislative programme.

149
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,870
量多嚇，喺呢方面咧，其實要加人手。如果唔係，啲嘢就會拖慢。

150
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,540
There is just a very clear trend in terms of the increasing volume and the increasing complexity of legislation.

151
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:20,560
position which we are seeking to have created will be for any specific project. As you point out, if we were seeking it for a particular project, then a supernumerary position may be appropriate. But we are seeking a permanent position to, in fact, enable us to fulfil our duties and responsibilities to.

152
00:27:42,900 --> 00:28:02,910
謝偉全議員，主席，主席嗱，你聽到佢冇好斬釘截鐵去重複你話你上堂收到嘅嘢，話呢個職位唔會負責廿三條立法。我頭先問得咁清楚，佢答咗一抽日係以前講過嘅嘢，都冇答到喎。陳志全議員嗱，你聽我講嗱，如果我記得咧，當時陳唔係你記唔記得佢肯唔肯再講？佢唔肯再講。

153
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:22,920
我要講翻上次講咩先嗱？啊，上次啊啊，杜根生就問佢：你係咪因為廿三條而立法而而要做呢樣嘢？佢話唔係，係因為工作量。佢話冇關嘅。噉你哋係咪認為佢可以話畀聽？我以後都唔寫廿三條咧。我唔覺得佢可以咯。唔係以後咧，就係呢個位會唔會負責？佢一家人就因為佢唔夠人，佢畀你睇廿。

154
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:42,930
廿幾年都冇加過人，佢有家人，有好多要做。你點可以要求人哋講明以後，以後都唔準寫廿三條？你可以咁做咩？佢會答你咩？啲多餘啊！你做啲嘢噉樣係嘛？啊！而家謝偉全議員啦，謝偉全議員，你咩演繹？佢咪講得好清楚嗱。如果我聽咧，我一個平常心聽，我就覺得佢話咧。

155
00:28:42,930 --> 00:29:02,940
係冇關係嘅，純粹係工作量嘅啫。但係你哋要夾硬執佢，唔好做廿三條，我覺得你係白費心機，係做唔到你嘅目的嘅，亦都浪費我嘅時間。謝偉全議員五分鐘。係多謝主席。其實誒文件咧都交代咗啦，主席頭先已經講過啦。其實喺過去呢十幾廿年咧。

156
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:22,950
律政司嘅民事呢個法律科同埋呢個法律草擬科嘅工作量係大增㗎嘛，大增嘅時候我哋睇咧，其實過去咁多年咧，就呢個首長級嘅人手都冇乜點樣變過。咁呢個正正咧，就係我點解要支持呢個開位啦嘛，工作。

157
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:49,350
噉啊，法律草擬科咧，其實我瞭解咧，就係負責嗰個草擬法例啦，包括即係嗰啲條文啊、用字啊，係咪通上啊？有冇同其他法例有抵觸啊？咁當然最重要咧，係咪可以落實咗相關呢方面嘅原意？

158
00:29:52,230 --> 00:30:12,240
咁誒，至於嗰個政策立法啊、政策嘅目的同埋執行啊等等咧，呢啲細節係點樣咧？我覺得係應該係相關嘅呢個政策局去負責嘅。誒，草擬主席就係草擬嗰個法例啦，個法例係我。

159
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,960
率啊嘛！

160
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,340
Miss Thomson。

161
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,820
誒幾時立法？

162
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,600
另外就係，如果唔加人。

163
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,160
我覺得係同呢個誒。

164
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,650
政策局要做一啲法律上嘅條文。

165
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,500
第二樣咧，就係至於有人提過，譬如二十三條。

166
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,680
啊！你你個問題就唔好針對某一條條例咯，覺得其實佢哋嚟講。

167
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:01,320
要需要嘅立法嗰個時間係一路一路噉樣拖延落去。

168
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,540
另外，主席，我都想佢答一答，即係而家加人係咪因為工作量嘅問題？

169
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:55,420
咁嗰啲有咩方法去做咧？係咪即係將有關佢哋工作唯有拖長，令到咧即係有適切或者？

170
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:39,790
所以我喺呢度咧，我係支持嘅。咁但係我想問咧，頭先我講咗一輪，即係嗰個草擬誒政策誒呢個草擬個法律草擬科嗰個，我話嗰個工作嗰個包含咧，嗰個理解啱唔啱？我想問第一樣嘢，理解啱唔啱？

171
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:33,450
我諳的 member， yes， your understanding is correct in that the law drafting division drafts provides those drafting services when drafting instructions have been approved by the relevant policy bureau， and they come to the law drafting division. It is at that point in time that we become involved.

172
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:09,530
草擬方係無關，因為呢個唔係佢哋嘅職責，或負責幾時去立法。政策局佢決定啊嘛。啊，噉我想我想誒誒呢呢方面可唔可以答不答？我嘅理解啱唔啱？唔該，主席。So, Miss Johnson, you want to comment on Honourable Chair's comment?

173
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:32,250
諗草業科都係跟翻政策局嗰個要求，或者佢哋想嗰個指示，想做乜嘢去做嘢㗎嘛？咁呢個至於即係係頭先講邊條法例，你叫佢哋點樣答咧？你即係難為咗佢哋嘅啫，因為其實佢哋係做一個喺呢方面。

174
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:52,260
工作係草擬啲法例，呢個法例邊條去做咧？佢哋跟佢做噉。如果太多嘅時候人手唔夠，咁咪加人啦。噉你認為喂佢哋係效率唔夠啊？亦或真係呢個工作量係要加人咧？咁大家去判斷啊嘛。呢樣嘢你如果唔知道，問多啲咯，即係工作量啊嘛。

175
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:21,940
係要做嘅，佢哋唔係跟嚟草議咯。呢個呢個其實就係佢哋嘅職責。咁所以同呢個工作量，你十幾廿年都冇交過，大家嘅期誒市民啊各方面嗰個期望又提升，工作量又複雜咗，咁人手唔加，咁點做咧？唯有拖啫嘛，拖咪冇效率咯。我哋而家想有效。

176
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:26,080
If I could refer to the figures that I mentioned in the paper, and perhaps add one to it. In two thousand and six, the law drafting division drafted five hundred five thousand two hundred and fifty two pages. By two thousand and seventeen, that's up sixty three percent to more than eight thousand.

177
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,390
嗯。

178
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,110
啊！

179
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,850
都係比較複雜。

180
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,210
stop。

181
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,320
The fact that we have only two.

182
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,440
在terms of what it means to the law drafting division.

183
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,160
That relate to quality, for example, around readability.

184
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:50,010
deputy lord raftsman means that we need to be quite pragmatic in the way in which we meet the timetable.

185
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:34,120
last year in fact the figure was above nine and a half thousand pages and of those we had many that were

186
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:21,480
things that are the absolute essentials is the scheme workable, legally effective, the same in English and Chinese. If we have

187
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:33,100
an opportunity for more supervision at that level, then the clearances that are provided could happen at an earlier point in time, and they could look more at other issues.

188
00:33:51,590 --> 00:34:11,600
It means that the number of checks that are done by the deputy law draftsman occur at a later point in time. So they are looking at a narrower scope of things. They are ensuring that legislation is legally effective, that the meaning between the English and the Chinese is the same. They are looking at the

189
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:58,070
好，阿石禮謙議。主席誒辛苦你啊！直叫今晚直叫七點鐘。如果你同佢哋，你嘅責任唔係要佢哋明白，你嘅責任只係做呢個會做得去順利嘅啫。通過我係需要通過啲依啲誒需求喺度。如果佢哋唔明白咧，係唔係你嘅事？佢哋明白，因為佢冇。

190
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:18,080
自己冇心去理，或者佢冇噉嘅時間去了解。主席，我話嘅真係唔需要理佢哋，唔需要同佢哋拗嚇。你係太好心去解釋畀佢聽，但係有時啲越解就佢哋越唔明㗎嚇。我我係呢度咧，我係支持呢個開位嘅主席，同埋頭先啊，Teresa。

191
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:40,500
阿梁繼昌嗰陣時個問個問題答得好清楚㗎。佢依個依啲個位開個係所謂叫general係嘛general個位嚟㗎。如果有specific嘅咧，佢又要專門有一個需要要人嗰陣時，佢就會嚟翻嗰個panel嗰度，然後e s c都個噉，然後佢同意曬啦。

192
00:35:40,500 --> 00:36:00,510
先嚟我哋依一度個情況一路好清晰嘅，嗰個程序就係噉啊嘛。而家你再去行翻轉頭，冇可能嘅。第一，第二咧，就算係有廿三條，佢而家攞咗依個人啊，佢冇話到唔做廿三條。如果佢要可以有廿三條畀佢做嘅，佢哋又可以做得到嘅。我哋點？

193
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,360
Thank you.

194
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,050
Miss Tsangson。

195
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,500
嗰個法律。

196
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:40,310
主席，我就仲想跟進就係頭先嗰個誒，我哋嗰個其中嘅問題就係話。

197
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:33,370
下一位郭家麒議員五分鐘。否認咗喎，上次同廿三條係完全無關係，否認咗喎。人哋邊度有否認過啫？

198
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:28,200
Indeed, I would think that that is a fact well understood by members. The law drafting division needs to be equipped with adequate resources to provide an up-to-service

199
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:51,860
咪，所以你話邊個係複雜化唔複雜化？佢哋自己有衡量，佢自己點去做啊？主席，誒，為為你自己身體唔需要咁勞氣啊，同佢哋知唔知啊？啊！

200
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:44,720
唔需要咁理去解佢哋明唔明白之前嘅問題咧。嗱，而家好似好似我講講緊嘢，我係好平心靜氣地嚇，好唔好啊？多謝主席，我時間仲未到啊，阿Miss Wong。

201
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:55,240
制定草案等等啦，我哋都係明白嘅。但係個問題就係法律草案嗰部分，咁頭先有委員都問得好清楚啦，同個二十三條嘅關係喺邊？我畀多啲時間你去答下。

202
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm not sure that there is anything more that I can say on this particular topic. Providing drafting services for legislation that's proposed by the government, that is the primary responsibility for the law drafting division.

203
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:20,520
喺喺基本法分分功夫喺度。如果我哋冇可能管佢哋點做乜嘢，幾時做乜嘢，我哋只係佢需要人，我哋係配合到佢哋個人喺度。如果佢有需要要做廿三條，佢又唔需要請人嘅，都甩緊啲，佢咪做咯。而家唔係，而家我哋唔可以每一單每一。

204
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:40,530
條條例都要問佢幾時做？呢條例係有嗰啲人喺度，啲功夫去到嗰度，佢咪做咯。主席咁簡單嘅嘢係唔應該同佢拗㗎。誒，加翻住個成個情況喺度，我哋咪好，我個人好歡迎啊！你攞埋嚟最最好啊，唔需要加人做添，係咪？

205
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:13,110
多謝，多謝阿阿石禮謙議員。不過我想講咧，其實我只係將嗰啲上次開會嘅資料提供畀啲委員嚇，噉佢唔領情，其實冇問題。個問題係咧，如果佢噉樣糾纏一啲唔應該糾纏嘅嘢咧，我覺得佢係重複，亦都浪費我哋個會。因為呢個項目咧，如果前後都傾咗成四個幾鐘啊，如果你話，

206
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:33,120
個個項目噉樣傾咧，香港市民大鍋啦嚇，一樣都唔使做啦，係嘛？咁所以我係急係急呢樣嘅啫。其實都係，不過多謝你嚇，因為學你話齋，你有個權喺度。如果佢哋係噏啲廢話嘅，係或者佢係唔明白嘅，你冇需要延長個會。我哋係唔白喺度都係支持你去應該要你做嘅情況，你。

207
00:37:45,190 --> 00:38:05,200
阿毛孟靖議員，請你尊重下人哋啦。人哋講嘢啊，你講嘢冇人冇人阻你，冇人嘈你。你講嘢啊，就喺執啊噉樣唔啱㗎嘛。就算你道理啱曬，你都尊重人哋嘅權利啊。你五分鐘，你又唔好搞人哋。O K？如果唔係你噉樣嗱，如果你第日噉樣，你係噉，你講嘢人哋又閘你，你我就唔會阻止啊，因為你慣咗係噉。不過我。

208
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,010
Miss Tanzen。

209
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,810
Ms. Johnson.

210
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,260
相為背，所以我哋先至問得咁多。

211
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:55,460
或者我可以噉樣問啦，即係呢一個新增嘅職位咧，你個？

212
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:52,160
時係曾經呢一個要求，而呢一個要求係要你增加邊一啲嘅人手同埋個數字。

213
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:49,450
with the finance committee's approval, to deal with the general increase in workload, both complexity and volume.

214
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:17,330
The Department of Justice is the government's legal adviser. Our communications in that capacity with government and with

215
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:07,550
我 can again repeat that providing the drafting services for legislation proposed by the government is the primary responsibility of the law drafting division.

216
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:41,050
up to standard service. In terms of particular projects, this position is not being created for a particular project or projects. This position is being created.

217
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:33,130
with the bureau and with the departments, they are subject to legal professional privilege, and that extends to whether there is any draft bill or related information as to whether or not there's a particular bill or any drafting instructions for a particular bill.

218
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:13,010
講法或者我當係你嘅承諾，亦都因為你知喺財委會入邊嘅所有嘅，嗯，我哋有曬記錄嘅，即係話呢一個涉及加位嘅呢一部分，喺而家或者將來都一定唔會涉及二十三條立法呢一部分，可唔可以確定？

219
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:52,020
for this reason, we're not in a position to confirm whether or not there's any work or anything in contemplation on any proposed legislation, unless the information's already been disclosed by government. and I trust that the concept of legal professional privilege is well understood by members.

220
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:25,210
我唔鼓勵呢樣嘢嚇。阿石禮謙議員，你仲有冇嘢係要補充？我主主席叫你即係係跟翻住你應該要做嘅事情，你去做嚇。你就係依個會嘅master procedure，你去決定去做依個法法律上基本法上各個喺法律個個判詞都有畀到你依個權嘅。主席，多謝你。好嘅，唔該曬。

221
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:42,920
The law drafting division will need to provide drafting services for whatever legislation the government requires. That is the answer that I am able to give。咁即係話咧嗱，我清得好清楚咧，就係誒法律草擬科咧，就係無論政府攞任乜嘢嘅條例，我哋講緊嘅二十三條，即係香港人係極之討厭呢一。

222
00:40:42,920 --> 00:41:02,930
條咧，如果真係拎到嚟咧，你係冇法子去拒絕。亦都點解咧？專員，你明白點解喺呢一度咧？其實唔係留難你，或者唔係留難你嗰個部門嘅。你要明白，我哋擔心咧就係政府借刀殺人，即係話咧利用你個部門咧，係作為一個政治嘅一個工具咧，去施行一個廿十三二十三條立法。

223
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:22,940
呢個係我哋成個即係討論入邊咧，其中一個重要一點。你亦都明白香港嘅處境底下咧，係一個冇民主選舉嘅政制入邊咧，公眾同埋立法會員對於二十三條立法係一個好大嘅憂慮，亦都呢個係同基本法入邊啊，即係畀香港人嘅民主自由等等咧係。

224
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,980
為二十三條立法。

225
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,910
今日我哋處理呢個人事編制。

226
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,970
有工作方面要編排。

227
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,240
無論佢係二十三好，二十四、二十五至二十六。

228
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:44,280
主席，我想澄清係有啲咁多嘅言論嘅問題嘅謬論啦，噉就。

229
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:36,730
啲公務員、非政治任命公務員所要求嘅一啲嘅水平嚟，我希望你明白。何君耀議員。

230
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:09,750
如果個政府係透明同埋公正嘅話咧，所有佢曾經考慮過嘅立法，無論邊一條法例。

231
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:29,950
佢亦都唔能夠同你透露任何嘅咩問題。又講翻即係白少少，就算係要去。

232
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:55,520
呢一個項目咧，文件就寫得好清楚，建議開呢個位咧，就就係協助政府去立法。

233
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:09,640
二零一八一九七三根本又唔係講二十三，但係你哋啊啊郭郭醫生就猛喺度為二十三條糾纏，你根本都冇噉嘅。

234
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:40,910
當然而家唔係呢個情況啦。有有咩問題啊？二十三條基本法裏邊，其中一個我哋嘅憲制責任嚟㗎嘛？

235
00:42:52,320 --> 00:43:02,330
我個認知同你又唔同，因為事實上每一毫子嘅公帑喺今日咧，包括你個科要開個位咧，都係納税人同埋香港人嘅錢嚟。

236
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:24,230
亦都唔恰當咧，就話你可唔可以擔保啊？專員，而家我畀呢個位你啊，呢個人完全唔會掂二十三條嘅嘢。個專員點能夠可以作噉嘅承諾嘅啫？佢根本都冇噉嘅冇噉嘅權力可以作出噉嘅承諾。

237
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:21,700
若果係香港有需要立法嘅，咁噉佢哋嗰個即嗰個嗰個技術官僚就要照做㗎啦。噉啊，剛才專員亦都已經講得好清楚，噉佢哋係上邊有咩政策，佢哋就係技術官僚就起草草擬嘅法案。噉啊，而家草擬啲乜嘢咧？

238
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:45,550
噉我就誒想喺你嗰度可以確認啦，喺你過往呢誒呢一段時間，喺你上任呢段時間，政府有冇曾經係開始誒探討過你嗰個科入邊係需要誒未來去預備一啲人手去預備最重要二十三條立法？如果有嘅係幾？

239
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:30,050
當然，我哋係討論緊二十三條嘅話咧，公眾係有權知呢啲錢，無論而家個位或者理科入邊嘅人咧係咪涉及？因為如果呢一樣嘢得唔到一個清晰嘅回答嘅話咧，即係你已經有一個即係取向，就會幫政府去掩飾某啲動作。咁呢個唔係我哋即係睇一啲。

240
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,640
小錯情。

241
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,540
係啊！

242
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,080
執行咗呢個憲制責任未啊？

243
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,190
誒，主席就。

244
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,380
而況且，我剛才講二十三條，就算要立法，當然呢刻未有啦。

245
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,680
但係我哋更加明白，基本法都講明，我哋要普選特首同埋普選全部立法會議員㗎。

246
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:39,950
喺唔同嘅層面討論過，咁所以我完全支持呢一個開位嘅嗰個嗰個誒誒嘅要求啊！嚇，多謝。好啊，黃碧雲議員四分鐘。

247
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:41,190
如果你而家加開呢個位嚇，開多一個嘅誒法律草擬科嘅一個一個高級嘅職位，去處理一啲重大而複雜嘅一啲法律條文嘅操作嘅時候，噉我哋梗係要問你㗎啦。噉係咪包埋要起草二十三條嘅本地嘅立法啊？咁？

248
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:51,430
你唔好講到何君彥話啊！你係咪驚定係畀人拉咗？你抗拒呢樣嘢啊！你點咪太小家啲小人之心嚟嘅？上次啊，二零零三年嘅時候搞呢條立法，全香港五十萬人上街，塞到成個中環、成個銅鑼環、成個灣仔爆曬啊！點解啊？因為人人覺得。

249
00:44:41,190 --> 00:45:01,200
我二十三條立法有乜問題啊？你而家你當你自己係咩咩人啊？你自己係係諗住違反二十三條，所以好鬼驚有二十三條嘅嚟去去去去去去抵暴你，所以你而家盡量要阻住佢噉樣。咁根本即係呢個問題岔開嚟講，睇翻呢一個F.C.L。

250
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:49,840
納入喺嗰個嗰個嗰個草誒誒誒呢一個草擬誒法例委員嘅佢佢嗰個專員下邊嘅工作係好好順理成章㗎，咁所以點解你會覺得呢件事係係洪水猛獸？第二，你剛才講嘅話，香港人對呢個二十三條好反感，我唔知道你喺邊度有噉嘅嘅嘅基礎。

251
00:45:49,840 --> 00:46:09,850
我話反感係咪啊？我就覺得呢個應該要做添啦，要快啲去做添啦，唔好遲添。所以你嘅香港人同我香港人嘅定義係乜嘢咧？我又唔知你代表幾多香港人係咪啊？咁所以我哋唔好再喺度糾纏係咪誒開呢個位係為二十三條嘅問題。我覺得專員剛才已經答得好。

252
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:29,860
骨子好企理，佢話根本冇任何嘅嘅嘢喺度，亦都唔方便話畀你聽。咁所以你你而家噉樣插隻手埋嚟去micromanagement咧，係好唔恰當。噉啊，主席，我覺得呢個咧就唔唔需要再糾纏落去，應該要要批准批准。上次喺A J O S又討論過。

253
00:46:43,750 --> 00:47:03,760
即係我哋見到建制派議員，其實佢哋嘅責任都係坐喺度禁制嘅啫。咁所以即係佢哋都唔係好明點解我哋要問咁多問題。咁但係其實佢哋應該係要領教過坐喺度禁制嚇，唔諗清楚個問題，唔問清楚嘅後果嘅最近嘅一個後果，咪就係嗰個財政。

254
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:23,770
預算案你哋通過咗咯，裏邊咪就係已經係申請長者綜援嘅年齡由六十六十歲本來合資格嘅，而家咧要改到六十五歲咯。林鄭話係你哋禁制支持㗎嘛，咁所以如果呢個政府係噉樣做嘢嘅話咧，你唔怪得我哋一定如果要問清楚嘅喎，如果。

255
00:47:41,860 --> 00:48:01,870
咁如果我哋而家問都唔問嘅話咧，政府嚟啲乜嘢嘢交去法律草擬科，你都要寫㗎啦嘛？咁當然就會包括埋二十三條立法啦，唔可以排除呢個可能性㗎嘛。咁所以其實你左閃右避冇答，但係我又唔明點解財委會主席嘅波哥話：，誒一定唔會做二十三條立法，你根本就表

256
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,630
條條例寫得好差。

257
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,790
Any respond on this one?

258
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,130
有冇回應？我想聽下。

259
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,090
The chief executive has.

260
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,910
政府嗰邊。

261
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:37,050
係咪有可能包括埋《基本法》二十三條立法嘅草案？

262
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,150
when we look at what the workload of the law drafting division has been.

263
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:42,990
been quite clear about the government's position in relation to that, and I can say no more.

264
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:31,300
係今日強人所難，佢哋係政府一個部門，政府要去做乜嘢，佢又做乜嘢㗎啦？係咪啊？你根本問嘅多餘嘅，根本。

265
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:23,800
同埋喺財政預算案，所以今次一定要問清楚喎！你就唔好喺度執執博幫政府擋箭，你嘅責任係主持會議，而唔係幫政府答問題，仲要答錯。

266
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:14,350
Draft the legislation that's required by the government. That puts to one side the responsibilities to do other things, for example, the vetting of members' bills.

267
00:49:49,440 --> 00:50:02,540
There has just been a very clear trend in terms of increasing the volume and increasing the complexity. In terms of what the law drafting division's primary responsibility is, it is in fact to

268
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:11,840
人人覺得人人人人自危，公民嘅基本權利、表達自由、新聞自由、學術自由、言論自由，全部都會受到影響。作為立法會議員，今次開呢個位，我哋係咪應該問清楚？我哋已經畀你設嗰一鑊啦嘛，財委會。

269
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:33,190
所以，當它來到什麼那，可能，我們看什麼是公開可得的，我們知道那那是，法律起草部門的責任將會在將來的期間，當它來到那個特定的問題，當成員提到。

270
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:24,830
咁所以根本上人哋就冇咁講過，人哋就話政府要整啲咩嚟？你咪問下局長咯，問下林鄭咯，要起草啲乜嘢？加呢個位嗰個人咪要去做咯。佢哋冇得say yes or no㗎嘛。咁所以我哋而家點解唔係問清楚啊？嗱，雖然基本法二十三條係講咗我哋要進行本地立法，我哋明白，我哋有呢個憲制責任。

271
00:50:43,640 --> 00:51:03,650
好嗱，因為阿黃碧雲議員咧反覆講啲錯誤嘅嘢，所以我一定要澄清嗱。我叫大家去聽帶，你哋又去睇帶，你就唔去。噉我而家要求秘書處咧，將阿陶允新講啲説話咧就截錄咗出嚟，咁大家可以即係評個道理啦。陶允新當時咧喺上個禮拜就問呢個post會唔會做廿三條？

272
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:23,670
當時阿Mr Dixon誒Dixon嘅答案就係not for any particular item of legislation，唔係特別為某一個項目而做。我覺得佢講得好清楚啊，講明唔係啦。你而家要求人哋話畀人聽，你一定唔可以做廿三條。我覺得係一個好好幼稚、戇居、好傻嘅問題。

273
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,720
Miss Johnson， any comment?

274
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,330
我感謝成員 for his support.

275
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,630
誒，請大家唔好喧譁，已經大家唔好喧譁嚇。

276
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,540
係咪就係佢唔會寫條廿三條咧？如果有需要嗰陣。

277
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,790
簡直無謂嘅呢個問題，譚志明議員，譚志明議員。我話主席。

278
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:01,270
Yeah， but he said about some laws are not sufficient， and there's more things to be done。

279
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:30,790
O.K. Indeed. Marine Department. O.K. 鄭美芬議員。係主席，我諗咧就係誒。

280
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:48,280
係咪先？我我我覺得兩件事係冇直接嘅關係嘅，我都我都唔明，我喺度拗乜嘢啊？不過anyway，我講完啦，我係支持啦，誒呢個呢個呢個要求嘅。

281
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:35,570
同埋好多海事法例，你仲最近都未追完啊！啊，嗰啲I&M嗰啲。嗱，另外一個問題咧，主席，我唔明我哋喺度拗乜嘢？我哋法民啲同事係咪話？係咪話如果律政署呢個位我哋唔批？

282
00:51:42,190 --> 00:52:02,200
誒主席，我可以發言未咧？好啊，請講，請講，請講。O.K.啊，到你時間，你又講請禁制啊？請講，阿譯志明議員。嗱，我啊，主席，我發言咧係支持律政署咧係加人手嘅啊，因為咧我自己就覺得誒而家好多嘅法例咧係需要加快咧去update嘅啊。就舉個例，近來報紙成日講嘅。

283
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:22,280
避風塘，我哋霸位過嚟擺船咧，我都要求喺事處去執法。咁但係問題咧，法律並不賦予佢有呢個權力喺今時今日，係必須修訂個法例嚟進行嘅。咁所以咧，其實咧，我喺我哋交通嗰度相關運輸嘅咧，相當多個事項需要去進行。咁所以咧，我係支持你哋開會盡快去做。

284
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:23,300
唔使答啦。唔使答。Okay, he said that there's no need to answer. I think he probably probably uh taunted your department to sort out what he think is not sufficient. Well, certainly when it comes to policy, that is not a responsibility for the law drafting division. It would be appropriate to speak to the relevant bureau.

285
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:51,090
Miss Theresa Johnson咧係答得非常清楚，佢亦都唔可以再答落去呢個議程咧。我哋喺二零一八年六月司法及法律事務委員會，我哋進行過詳細嘅討論，包括埋咧一九八零年代至今，其實喺人手啊都未曾做過調整。

286
00:53:51,090 --> 00:54:11,100
大家知道啦，九七年之後有基本法啊，司法覆核啊，頭先已經講埋啦嘛。誒，嗰啲號型聲稱佢等等等等，仲有好多例法例咧。我哋自己喺社會發展咧嘅過程中都要制定根本咧。我就好好吃驚嘅，當時我知道佢話一九八零年代至今嗰個。

287
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:31,110
未有作出一個比較誒，我覺得合時嘅調整。好啦，嗰啲同事再三逼佢講二十三條。第一，我就拗曬頭，我覺得莫名其妙。第一咧喺司法覆覆事務委員會，我又聽唔到佢哋咁問啦嚇。我哋成個議程討論嗱，第二咧，我真係覺得呢個問題係非常之唔恰當同埋幼稚嘅。

288
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:51,340
因為咧，佢哋你知唔知律政司佢做乜嘢咧？佢做嘅就係配合政策。我你哋自己討論咁多次，參加嗰啲委員會都知道，政策局決定咗，如果要立例先至去到律政。佢點點可能答你佢將會點樣？但係個問題佢答得非常之好，佢根本就係。

289
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,120
我想問，可唔可以打一答，Miss Johnson？

290
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:56,560
即係票添，你咪係棄權咗啊！攞呢個做例子。

291
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,300
我諗，The Member for these comments，The workload of the law drafting division at present is extreme.

292
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:03,860
另外一樣嘢，我就覺得即係其實誒誒，梁美芬議員都講咗啊，好清晰就係喂，我覺得即係。

293
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:20,820
唔應該特定問一個特定嘅法例去問，喂會唔會喺呢個位？噉我用一個啊反問法，即係可能你哋嘅邏輯係中意逆向啲嘅。我又想問，如果唔加呢個位啊，政府當政府要考慮做廿三條嘅時候，你哋而家係咪都要做啊？

294
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:54,350
作為我指出了，我們在事實上有近10,000頁的立法，那是在去年發表的。我哋講緊37個條例，那是在2018年通過的，28個法案被公佈。

295
00:54:51,340 --> 00:55:11,350
工作量過重，然之後佢要配備多一個人手。你而家咧就將你自己，你個你哋某部分人啊，最怕嗰條法例好啦。咁相繼咧又揾一條啦，會唔會立呢個咩誒集體訴訟啊？你立唔立？你唔立，你要想話no咗先，唔可能嘅。呢啲係非。

296
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:31,360
非常之唔恰當，你叫佢答我几几即係好，我覺得佢真係好好嘢，我非常之欣賞佢就係答到最正確嘅答案，佢亦都唔可以再講落去。呢個先係佢嘅崗位嚟㗎嘛。如果唔係，我哋都要在座個個都可以問一條啦，我都可以即刻問啦。你會唔會就住婚姻條例？你你會唔會有？

297
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:51,370
修改啊！你修改，我即刻就否決你。你哋仲唔係話否決添？你要佢即刻噉樣回答都唔係佢個政策，佢唔係咁噉。所以，我覺得有一啲問呢個問題嘅人係非常資深嘅立法會議員。我認為咧，大家嘅討論要去翻一個合理嘅一個環境，而且司法及法律事務委員會。

298
00:55:51,370 --> 00:56:11,380
討論過一致嘅喎，嗰陣時咁點解而家會出咗呢啲問題咧？所以我真係本來咧我就唔唔，我覺得頭先一開始已經講夠，但係我亦都唔想話誒用point or quota，所以我自己撳掣排排過嚟，清清楚楚講清楚。我唔認為呢個問題再應該喺呢啲咩二十三條嗰度。

299
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:31,390
攪錢落去，如果政策局佢係能夠畀我哋説服，我哋根本好多人認為要立二十三條添，係咪啊？我哋而家仲喺度鬧緊，點解仲唔起步？係咪啊？你哋唔中意，我哋中意，咁點咧？係咪啊？我我係咪話你要立啊，我先至批咧？唔係噉樣去做嘢㗎。我覺得我哋大家好多係知。

300
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:51,400
心嘅議員嚟㗎，問嘢係咪要合理？你明知佢哋而家係講緊佢要加人手，係工作量嘅問題。呢個係我覺得佢係好合理，亦都已經盡可能係答到。佢答到答咗咗，或者由佢根本都唔可能，佢唔喺個崗位可以噉樣回答你個問題㗎嘛？主席，我就喺度增加翻啲資料同埋嗰個。

301
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,190
麥迪議員。

302
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,800
三分鐘。

303
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,330
係唔該，主席就。

304
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:29,490
啲立法嘅時候就反映咗喺寫呢份文件嗰個行文裏面啊，主席。

305
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:11,810
因為咧，啊陶謹生議員唔係無的放矢去提出嗰個關於二十三條嗰個問題，點解同事會？

306
01:01:54,830 --> 01:02:03,420
你有呢兩個元素加埋一齊嘛？噉你要我哋唔好向呢個方向諗，你咧就要。

307
01:00:53,820 --> 01:01:03,150
我就上次聽會咧，聽到阿陶錦新議員嗰個提問之後咧，我會形容係靈機一觸啊！

308
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:37,740
好似屠瑾新議員咁講，你無情情咧就將一個其實係好簡單嘅國歌法嘅立法咧，就講成為一個重大嘅議題。

309
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:25,010
有呢個印象，就因為你個文件裏面，你有兩個部分係令人有噉樣嘅誒睇法啊嘛。第一就係喺二十七段裏面，二十七段裏面。

310
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:30,240
所以， all I can say is that the workload within the law drafting division is very high, and I do not believe that it's sustainable to continue with only two deputy law draftsmen. We have gone from having only 19

311
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:54,520
嗱，咁呢個係第一個線索，第二個線索就係喺附件七裏面，噉你就話呢一位誒新嘅專員咧，就係要親自草擬最為複雜或敏感嘅法例。

312
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:47,130
council within the division in 1982 to having 48 at the present time, and so the management structure within the division is in dire need of additional supplementary resources at that deputy law draftsman level.

313
00:56:51,400 --> 00:57:11,410
記錄，我哋司法及法律事務委員會其實係作出詳細嘅討論，並且係冇反對嘅情況底下，即係係係拎上嚟誒財委會嘅。好啊，多謝阿梁美芬主席嚇喺呢個司法事務委員會嘅補充呢個資料。劉國芬議員五分鐘。誒，都係主席。誒，本人都係支持咧，係。

314
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:31,420
呢一個開會嘅誒，特別我哋都睇得到而家好多嘅啊法律嘅草擬啦、法案啦，其實都係因為人手或者工作壓力嘅問題咧，都係做得好慢嘅。咁所以，如果係增加人手嘅話，可以加翻快個速度或者進度咧，都係值得支持嘅。咁頭先我自己都即係喺上面聽到啊，黃碧雲議員講。

315
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:51,430
因為即係緊係要睇清楚先去支持啦。噉我哋一定係睇清楚，但係應該要支持嘅嘢咧，就應該實事求是嘅。頭先佢攞財政預算案做一個例子，我以為佢有咩咁醒添，佢咪攞嚟投棄權表，講到好似自己投咗反對票噉樣喎，係嘛？即係我又以為佢投咗咩？

316
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:14,650
The workload is very high, and the subject matter on which we are drafting laws is increasingly complex. Sophisticated areas are being legislated for that, I guess, reflect Hong Kong's place in terms of international obligations, etc.

317
00:59:47,410 --> 01:00:07,420
其實事實就好清楚，基本上《林立廿三條》就係呢個啊政府同特首嘅決定。如果佢覺得民情適合啊，民情係O K嘅時候，佢覺得要立嘅時候，律政司加唔加呢個位，佢都要去做噉。所以誒，即係如果佢要做嘅時候，亦都用翻而家嘅人手，可能真係喺其他法例可能跟。

318
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:27,430
更加辛苦啲咯。咁所以，我又希望即係大家都唔好去糾纏，即係將政府嘅決定佢擺在一啲啊，即係啊司法啊或者公務人員嘅身上面咧，其實係唔公道嘅。因為其實佢哋而家面對嘅問題唔係立唔立邊一條法律嘅問題，面對問題就係而家佢嘅人。

319
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,260
唔相信可以持續。

320
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,380
攞嚟去提煉啲濃縮有用嘅。

321
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,610
唔係開呢個位去做㗎。

322
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,740
喂，你記住呢個係開呢個位。

323
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,010
如果你話阿譯志明講嗰啲噉嘅，

324
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,230
又係開嗰啲好敏感，又直接要領導嗰啲啊！

325
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:43,240
噉我都明啊，梁美芬議員就會話係哦，最為複雜，可能係你嗰啲啊。

326
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:38,100
同埋嗰個法已經做完啦嘛，係啦，嗰個法做完之後，跟住你再話有啲叫做最為複雜嘅嘢。

327
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:43,440
喂，咁廿三條咪一樣要做啊？噉你聽到Miss Johnson答咩啊？喂，我哋好辛苦，工作量好大。

328
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:10,870
咁所以，如果而家唔開呢個位，工作量咁大，你Johnson就話佢唔相信可以持續落去。

329
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:34,880
劉國芬嘅問題咧，正正係補充埋我嗰點咧，就而家水落石出㗎啦。兩分鐘，點解咧？佢問如果冇唔畀呢個位佢？

330
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:24,860
喂，如果咁講，商界又話：喂，你創創資金對沖又不準你寫啊！你啲集體朋友不準寫，今年唔work㗎嘛？你講得清楚，唔係為某一條啊嘛？已經講得好清楚啊！台灣新聞都好清楚，無論台灣新聞都好精警，但係你答得好清楚啊嘛！台灣新語員到你時間啦，啊，三分鐘。主席啊，我好多謝劉國芬語員個問題啊，真係問得好啊！

331
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:47,440
手已經係好緊張，佢係需要增加人手咧，去應付啊現有嘅啊法例嘅草議同埋未來啊或者好多嘅法例嘅草議。咁呢個先係一個最重要嘅問題。咁所以啊，即係我亦都唔需要用十五分鐘。咁主席，我係支持啊增加呢個人手嘅。好啊，啊朱愛。

332
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:24,060
解翻清楚，到底你喺二十七段做乜會將國歌法呢啲咁簡單直接就咁轉移過嚟啫嘛？抄功課噉樣嘅法例就講成為一個重大議題，因為其實係一葉之秋嘛。你你用呢個政治嘅眼鏡去睇呢？

333
01:02:44,070 --> 01:03:04,080
婚姻嗰啲係嘛？就你覺得係最為複雜嗰啲噉，但係大家老實，其實知道二零一九年嗰香港係咩咩狀況啊嘛？你都未立廿三條，就已經攞埋嗰啲誒社團條例都可以，即係攞嚟舞嚟舞去，去禁制人哋啲社團嘅運作。

334
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:24,090
跟住誒取消議員資格，趕走記者，已經乜都做得出啦。咁市民有乜理由係冇個基礎去反對你廿三條立法咧？因為你拿住把三瘦嘅刀，你都斬死人啦，仲要畀你磨把磨把呢個倚天劍出嚟劈人。

335
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:44,100
咁其實個嗰個類比就好似噉啊，主席點解如果有呢個噉樣嘅疑心咧，就會反對咧？就係我就會形容廿三條就係一個核彈嚟嘅，就炸死曬啲人㗎啦。咁而家呢個法律草擬科咧，就係一個核心嘅部分，就好似嗰啲離心機噉樣，就係話喂。

336
01:03:46,660 --> 01:04:06,670
噉我如果你有噉樣嘅嫌疑嘅話，咁個個緊係衝曬出嚟反對你啦，主席。所以係有噉樣嘅背景底下咯，你唔好覺得我哋好似無的放矢咯。阿阿阿朱國定議員，如果唔係因為噉，我唔會畀你問咗個幾鐘。但係你問咗個幾鐘，佢都講得好清楚，佢唔係為某一條法例啊嘛，咁講清楚啦。好似梁美芬咁講得好好啊。

337
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,070
Miss Miss Johnson。

338
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,910
噉佢其實係嗌救命。

339
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,380
我哋係講個capacity。

340
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,130
佢係唔答我啊！

341
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,610
咁所以服務處咪全部畀佢肯開咯。

342
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,610
at this point in time, at the beginning of two oh one nine.

343
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,470
If I could refer back to paragraph 27 of the paper.

344
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,600
有冇一個可以做嗰個位？

345
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:34,770
好啦，主席，我哋而家唔係講呢個位係咪做某一樣嘢。

346
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:54,520
草二科或者呢個位開咗之後，或者而家有冇做緊？

347
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:48,940
但係我上一次問過，我話特首話嘅前期工作啊，我問。

348
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:04,810
即係換句話講，你幾可能性一三可能性？一係就而家根本就做緊啲前期工作，佢頂唔順啦。

349
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:30,330
我點搞啊？你叫我廿三條，我點做啊？因為呢個就係正正要開到個位先得。建制派同事聽唔聽得明啊？

350
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:21,660
即係咩啊？你如果再畀啲廿三條嗰啲畀我，佢見directly，喂，我用李主席嗰個嗰個講法，我聽到出嚟就係。

351
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:53,190
這 paper was prepared at a time at which the two hundred and eighteen budget and tax related measures had not been drafted, and the local legislation for the national anthem law had been announced, but also had not been drafted.

352
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,470
邊位答？

353
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,270
啱喎，yeah， so you want to continue? Yeah, please.

354
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,330
所以， we now look at what is mentioned in the paper about what's further ahead.

355
01:09:54,070 --> 01:10:03,570
角色去做法例議稿㗎啦，然後梁美芬同埋謝偉全就話啊，工作量增加。今日我哋去講嗰件事。

356
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:34,090
職位係咪幫助你處理積壓嘅個案？當局你可唔可以回應下？首長級職位對於積壓案件其實係咪有幫助？好簡單答我，我得翻三十秒。

357
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:08,510
那工作 has now been completed and that forms part of the nine and a half thousand pages of legislation that I was talking about in relation to 2018.

358
01:07:51,030 --> 01:08:02,410
或， in fact， the subject of other government announcements， to illustrate the fact that the workload of the law drafting division is continuing at a very high level。

359
01:08:48,360 --> 01:09:01,680
上依個亦都係適用於而家兩位現有嘅副法律草擬精草擬專員，佢哋作為較高級嘅同事，當然係佢哋係負責一啲較為複雜嘅法例，依個係順理成章。

360
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:16,940
阿歐樂軒，餘兩分鐘。無論啱啱蕭生咧，定係主席你嘅講法都好啦，我嘅解讀都係係有呢個幫廿三條立法嘅可能性。你話not for any particular project嘛，話阿誒Miss Johnson。

361
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:30,580
And we talk about two mega projects there, the Trade Single Window project, and I'm happy to provide further details to justify why that is considered a mega project, and also the statutory corporate rescue procedure.

362
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:33,780
佢啱啱答兩位議員，聽下佢嘅講法啦。當佢答陳志全議員，佢係話not any specific project。佢答黃碧雲議員，佢係講the post is to draft legislation required by the government，so that if there is a requirement。

363
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:28,410
第二就係而家咧，就唔係做緊廿三條，乜個就預計可見將來要預備。如果特首政策科一撳掣話要做，我有spare capacity係有副專員嗰個位，係可以領導去做咁清楚。

364
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:51,030
project，both of those are mega projects，and then later this afternoon I have given examples of other complex legislative projects that have been announced by the government，whether they've been included in the CE's policy address of 2018 or are on the legislative program。

365
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:28,350
sorry，阿蕭生，你想講下？誒，主席，頭先有議員亦都提到，即係文件嘅附件七裏邊咧係誒有誒一啲描述咧。誒，我喺希度喺乜依度咧都希望咧係做一個解釋咧，希望議員咧依方面咧係唔需要咧係過分解讀文件裏邊有講咧，就係話依個新嘅職位嘅同時咧係會親自草。

366
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:48,360
草擬最為複雜嘅法例，咁呢個咧係一個誒非常合理嘅安排，就係話誒當然係比較高級嘅同事咧，係當然係佢哋負責咧係一啲複雜啲嘅法例，呢個係順理成章嘅。而呢個噉嘅要求咧，並不是咧係只限於呢個咧係新設嘅副法律草擬專員嘅職位，事實。

367
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,610
受團。

368
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,590
阿毛孟正議員三分鐘。

369
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:19,090
things are getting so sad.

370
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:18,810
而家即係當局唔止論據有誤，連論證嘅數據都唔真實。

371
01:12:54,900 --> 01:13:06,420
別講避而不宣，將冇需要寫成龐大需要，我對於律政司去講呢誤導性嘅表述咧，係十分之不滿，亦都違反咗法律專業操守。

372
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:13,560
費事我哋畀人話我哋亂咁嘥納税人嘅錢啦，呢啲都係話我哋本會嘅同事好嘅啫。希望各位舉手機器嘅同事為住納税人嘅荷包着想，本人僅此陳詞。

373
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:42,430
其實你都懷疑啦，主席文件講一套，批錢做另一套。啲文件嚟撥款嘅時候，政府已經係用咗啦。第三最後就係我哋而家經濟放緩嚇，公堂咧要審慎運用。

374
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:34,610
至於法律草二科，陶敬生議員就問廿三條，連簡單嘅是非題都淨係喺度同我哋講not specific, not any particular project，都唔係直接答yes定係no，係咪真係有難言之隱？

375
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:11,880
料就係每一年新增嘅案件咧，係達到五千至六千宗。咁大概喺呢個案件裏邊咧，我哋但係數目係冇轉變啊嘛。所以主席，我而家係唔信納佢哋嘅答案。我緊動用財委會議事程序第三十九條，要求中止呢一個嘅項目。

376
01:13:42,880 --> 01:14:01,000
我哋長期依賴賣地收入，今年個賣地收入追唔到一千億㗎嚇。我哋最近賣地成績唔好啊，啟德嗰個標又流標啊。未來政府嘅財政狀況係令人擔憂。公帑運用得宜，我哋應該要審慎睇每項支出，包括加位，仲要加個永遠嘅位。

377
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:54,070
但係，legislating article twenty three，佢就會做㗎啦。當然，嚇呢個第一啦。因為政策，第二會做咯，係啦。第二，第二，所以何君瑤講乜嘢唔係為廿三條立法？我請佢唔該睇文件第廿四段，如有重大立法工作，嗰個副專員就會擔任中央推動。

378
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:23,890
你睇翻係啊，佢哋都話啊工作量增加，但係我哋攞咗文件之後，原來每年新增嘅案件係冇一個特別增加嘅水平㗎。佢所講嘅到頭嚟，我理解就係原來積壓案件啊。咁所以我哋審議問題，你話工作量增加要問嘅問題就係話加咗呢個首長級。

379
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:55,760
阿張惠張金華議員係講緊民事法律嗰方面嘅，係啦，我諗佢搞錯咗，應該係唔係我我最初講法律草案係我而家講民事法律，而家講民事法律。O.K.，請請答。我簡單回答誒，多謝主席誒，積壓嗰個數咧，其實係亦都有一大部分咧係複雜嘅案件，我哋喺誒補充文件嗰度亦都畀咗一個知。

380
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:32,220
好啊，你而家先講三分鐘啊，你解釋點解你要做呢件事啊？好，明白。我有三個主要嘅理由，主席。第一，文件理據係不盡不實。會議嘅文件雖然好長，但係仔細閲讀文件同埋提問之後，發現當局提交嘅理據不足，部分用嚟論證開位嘅理據更加係不。

381
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:52,230
符邏輯，正如我之前喺會上面提過，文件反覆強調免顯反申請嘅個案同埋司法覆核有大量積存嘅個案，人為噉樣去製造需求，但係民事訴訟組嘅新增職位根本就唔係負責做學型申請嗰組開位都冇辦法分擔嗰啲工作，呢一啲噉樣樣嘅理。

382
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,710
projects in due course.

383
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:17,060
係，有啲乜嘢？

384
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:34,420
但係，呢次Meeting Chairman。

385
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,040
about these two new posts.

386
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:58,530
successfully stirred up some distrust.

387
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:03,320
on my part, that there could be some collusion there.

388
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:22,290
因為originally， nobody saw anything dodgy。

389
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:53,000
and we were wondering at the time why you would call a national anthem law particularly complex.

390
01:16:53,430 --> 01:17:01,590
它隻係三張紙或四頁紙 at most， right？ and then it's not voluminous in any way.

391
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:14,210
我唔知，可能唔涉及任何一位坐喺度嘅，但係喺呢個立法會同政府之間。

392
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:29,990
我係講，事情係 getting so so sad and ironic。我 had no intention of speaking again on this particular item originally。

393
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:47,770
因為上次，follow-up on James To的questions，我did ask about the connection between the legislation of Article 23 and this new appointment of a new head law draftsman。

394
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:44,620
但係，the fact that you actually cited the national anthem law as one example of laws law drafting which could be complex and voluminous， right？ We used those two adjectives last time， last week。

395
01:11:52,230 --> 01:12:12,240
句係誤導我哋議員審議呢個項目，更加荒謬嘅係實際上免遣返申請個案嘅數目係持續下降。張子榮議員都有提過，根據兩個禮拜之前保安局答覆梁美芬議員嘅查詢，就係話去到去年年底上代入境處審核嘅申請個案係得翻大約五百四十宗。

396
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:54,900
呢一點係冇辦法令到我信服。文件提述嘅理據，其實係咪廿三條先係真正開位嘅理由咧？第二，政府嘅部門亦都係屢次誤導我哋。律政司不論喺文件同埋答覆，都對於敏感嘅草案係實際包括乜係冇特。

397
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:26,710
呢啲不會唔係無的放矢，而係有前居可㗎。民政府、民嘅誤導同埋欺騙，我哋立法會都唔係第一次。主席，我知道你都留意立法會F.C.一零八一八一九零一號文件，亦都係朱議員去訊問幾項濾水廠水務工程嘅投標審批程序，因為而家懷疑緊水務署濫用財委會嘅批款。

398
01:14:48,470 --> 01:15:08,480
And I got the reply to the effect that you couldn't really either confirm or deny anything, any particular law being involved or to be involved, right? Because it's all subject to where the government's legislative.

399
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:31,270
So you couldn't confirm naturally, but you couldn't deny either, and I found that perfectly reasonable. I took it, I accepted that, and so I was prepared to stay quiet and just raise my hand to pass this request for funding.

400
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:55,060
claim that you categorically deny that this new post has anything to do with the legislation of Article 23, and he kept telling us that we were wrong, that we were the ones we are here being childish and so on, and that.

401
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,790
第二嘅主席。

402
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,510
張國軍議員。

403
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,340
好，就呢噉樣。

404
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,810
又認為要營造下一下氣氛先。

405
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:06,280
普選特首同埋普選全體立法會議員嘅，咁但係政府嘅講法咧就話，而家佢冇時間表。

406
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:58,050
噉我哋都誒同政府講好多次，我哋同誒特首亦都講過好多次，要求佢重啟政改，係盡快落實。

407
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:33,590
誒，主席就因為我哋始終聽唔到政府解答咧，就係佢而家開呢個位嗰位同事咧，係唔會。

408
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:42,010
做法或者政府詳詳細啲講清楚畀我哋聽，新加嘅呢一個位佢嘅具體嘅工作範圍，包括咗啲乜嘢重大而複雜嘅法律係需要而家呢個時候請人。

409
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:48,380
或者會係處理《基本法》二十三條立法嘅。咁民主黨嗰個立場講得好清楚啦。噉我哋認為咧，喺未落實雙普選之前咧，我哋係唔贊成為二十三條立法嘅。

410
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:20,620
And then we thought about Article 23, and that's how this discussion started. I rested, I thought, but this chairman started it. He restarted this discussion. So let this discussion be adjourned. Your time is up。

411
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:30,100
咁如果你政改嗰度都要慢慢營造氣氛，營造氣氛就唔使用錢嘅。咁如果你政改嗰度都未搞掂咧，我哋啊更加唔認為咧要去誒請人咧係有可能咧係要而家為二十三條立法咧係偷步走嘅。咁所以我哋認為而家宗旨咧都係一個適合嘅做。

412
01:18:44,750 --> 01:19:04,760
主席啊，即係我覺得今日誒有啲泛泛民反對嘅論據咧，我覺得真係有啲匪夷所思。即係我哋而家糾纏喺嗰個位咧，我完全係想像唔到。即係律政司之下開設呢個民事法律科同埋法律草擬科，當然係將來就係處理法律草擬同埋民事法律啦。噉你話將來佢嘅工作裏邊包唔包括某？

413
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:24,770
一樣嘢好視乎嗰樣嘢。嗱，假設你話二十三條係將來會唔會係政府嘅議程係嘅時候，如果佢係屬於法律草擬科噉，啊當然係屬於法律草擬科嘅工作啦。而家咧，我覺得咧有少少強人所難咧，就話假設我哋而家食環署開位請多個清潔工人，你就要食環署咧承諾咧呢個清潔工人將來咧可唔可以？

414
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:44,780
承諾唔清潔邊幾條街啊，我先畀你開。我諗冇一個人可以喺呢個時間咧承諾你將來究竟呢個人喺個科裏邊有啲工作係一定唔可以做嘅。我諗呢一個咧對於律政司嘅同事嚟講咧係有啲強人所難，亦都咧我覺得咧係一個唔適當。所以咧我係堅決反對呢一個宗旨嘅提。

415
01:19:47,890 --> 01:20:07,900
多謝主席。主席頭先啊，歐樂軒議員咧就提出就話佢要中止，其中一個原因就話誒，其實誒而家嗰啲誒學型申請嘅數字都不斷下降，咁呢個係事實嚟嘅。不過咧，佢只不過講咗事實嘅一半，就冇講埋另外一半。實際上面咧，就係而家做。

416
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,650
嗯。

417
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:45,870
啊。

418
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,010
多謝主席。

419
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,350
設計就係。

420
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,780
劉國芬議員。

421
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,310
咧係完全唔合邏輯嘅。

422
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:08,290
啊！拋之腦後，完全唔理嘅時候咧，我覺得係好荒謬嘅。咁所以我係反對呢個宗旨嘅，胡志偉議員。

423
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:18,550
主席，我就聽建制派嘅同事嘅回應咧，就有少少咧係即係將我哋嗰個問題嘅焦點咧係改咗嘅。

424
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:59,260
誒，我係反對終止呢個議程嘅。我覺得誒，反對派唔單止係因人廢言，亦都係因煙廢食嘅。老實咁講，你為咗一個即係。

425
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:39,230
必須要去處理嘅，因此歐議員剛才提嘅呢個論點咧，我認為係唔成立，我哋唔能夠支持佢嗰個終止代族嘅議案。劉國芬議員三分鐘。

426
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:38,760
老實咁講咧，頭先即係在座又好，或者啊解答嘅都好，都講咗。喂，其實佢哋政府一部分當特首或者政府決定咗一樣嘢嘅時候，無論佢加咗人手或者唔加人手嘅時候，佢都係要佢做㗎啦。但係個問題而家逼。

427
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:27,910
仲有六千幾七千宗嘅型申請者咧，係進行緊上訴，因此律政司嗰方面嘅工作咧係非常之沉重，亦都係需要多啲人手。即使我哋中審法院嘅大法官咧，亦都提出呢個係對司法機構咧係造成一個好大嘅壓力，係。

428
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:19,630
啊！即係你自己嘅政治啊立場，你覺得為即係你就一定係為廿三條服務，咁所以咧就我唔理你係有幾大嘅工作量都好，或者而家啲法例啊草擬得幾慢都好，我都唔理㗎啦，我都係唔畀你開位呢個。

429
01:21:40,780 --> 01:22:00,790
佢哋個工作量好重啊嘛，咁難道就係喂佢將來有機會係啊，即係為廿三條立法嘅時候咁好啦？我見到佢即係好多嘢做，好多嘢都即係做唔切嘅時候，或者工作量太大，我哋香港好多重要嘅事都等緊係即係草擬嘅時候都。

430
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:38,840
其實我哋民主派嘅同事，我哋當然好擔心廿三條嘅立法，亦都係一路我哋民主派嘅立場，覺得就係話未有呢一個雙普選之前咧，廿三條嘅立法咧係會引起社會動盪。呢一個係我哋嘅憂慮，呢個事實。咁誒喺今次嘅係誒呢一個嘅係職位嘅開設裏邊咧。

431
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:58,850
其實最大嘅問題就係話，政府官員咧係唔能夠回應我哋問你，你有冇就住廿三條立法嘅前皮前期嘅準備功夫咧，係要展開工作喺呢一點上邊？我需要答案只係有同埋冇嘅問題，但係咧我都只係聽到就係話。

432
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:18,860
即係嗰個回應咧，係無零兩可嘅。從呢個角度嚟講，其實我哋嘅憂慮咧，其實就反而就係話，因為作為特首曾經公開都有講過，現時個社會氣氛咧係完全唔適合展開廿三條嘅立法。但係攞咗呢個職位嘅時間，如果你當中已經係有咗。

433
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,300
陣知全員。

434
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:42,090
基礎，咁因此就係我希望。

435
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:08,310
咁正月我會交個鈎打落嚟，但係起碼你今日你都要清清楚楚答應呢一點。

436
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:29,950
因為主席你嘅理解同議員嘅理解係唔同嗱，專員答唔係為咗準備。

437
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:19,960
條例我就唔支持啊！嗱，如果政府司法科輸咗，要修訂婚姻條例，跟住專員唔可以講話啊？呢個位會唔會他朝真係要趕住㗎？

438
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:21,390
嗱，頭先個幾鐘頭嘅多輪提問裏邊咧，大部分嘅問題都係環繞究竟法律草擬科呢個誒位係係咪為咗準備廿三條立法？我覺得呢個討論咧係有價值嘅。

439
01:24:48,610 --> 01:25:04,320
個話，如果喺法律草擬科裏邊原來已經有所準備，而你今日喺個會議當中亦都唔清楚交代個話，呢一個係足夠令到我哋係要終止呢一個嘅係職位嘅申請，亦都定到我哋係可以清楚表述我哋嘅立場同睇法。

440
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:16,380
誒唔排除就唔排除嘅喎，噉樣你而家要問嘅啦。而家我畀你，你講明買遊戲機我就畀你。如果你而家答得隱隱晦晦又話誒唔知啊，到時使到需要用我咪買咯。咁即係又唔會一定買嘅。噉樣而家我都唔夠使，我都買唔到㗎啦。其實咁但係。

441
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:38,870
個係廿三條立法嘅係準備嘅功夫係展開當中嘅話，而你又唔講清講楚畀大家知嘅時候，其實某程度上亦都係隱瞞咗一啲政府嘅係工作嘅推展嘅。我哋係喺呢個基礎下邊咧，係覺得呢一個嘅誒文件所展述嘅內容咧，係我哋唔能夠接受嘅。

442
01:23:42,570 --> 01:24:02,580
或者官員可以即係準確啲答一答，就係話呢一個嘅廿三條嘅立法嘅準備功夫，而家係咪已經喺法律草擬科裏邊咧？係當中放咗喺你工作嘅日程上面，還是就係話好似你文件所講，其實而家冇嘅，我哋仲要專注其他嘅內容嘅。咁當然啦，我唔知道將來幾時。

443
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:28,600
你就算答咗民主派都會因為呢一個憂慮，可能都仍然係唔贊成呢一個職位嘅開設。但係始終都係清楚公開交代咗廿三條嘅立法喺政府嘅工作程當中，而家係企喺個乜嘢位置上邊，而大家都可以有之所準備有所應對。畢竟廿三。

444
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:48,610
三條嘅立法係香港社會市民大眾一個非常非常之憂慮嘅一個嘅係，即係影響到我哋嘅言論自由嘅一個嘅法例。而呢一個憂慮由零三年開始係延續到今天，仍然係在其中嘅。咁因為噉樣樣，我亦都覺得就係林鄭月娥自己都講咗，佢覺得係唔適合嘅東西。

445
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:50,240
某一條法例唔係為咗準備任何一條法例嚇，但係噉樣唔等於同廿三條無關嚇。即係我哋其實個個討論過程就係啊，你話開呢個位你要做A、B、C，咁會唔會做D啊？噉樣噉佢就話唔咁D會唔會係廿三條啊？噉樣嗱，佢啲。

446
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,730
噉。

447
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:25,670
個所謂所謂重點工作嘅，你未解到嘅。

448
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:44,670
我支持咧，係因為嗱，而家陳一勤咧就話。

449
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:31,630
咁咧，我覺得你係冇答冇答咩問題咧？冇答到底。

450
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:30,470
即係就係誒何俊賢又幫手畫公仔，畫埋出場。

451
01:29:54,360 --> 01:30:01,800
噉佢梗係唔答啦，亦都唔會肯啦。佢都佢冇呢個權㗎嘛。咁但係誤會咗，我哋唔係。

452
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:40,150
咁但係我我支持呢個宗旨咧，主席就唔係因為誒唔係因為佢已經畫咗出腸啊，佢未畫出腸嘅。

453
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:54,070
佢咧係唔肯承諾，即係話我哋啊就逼呢個律政司就答，話你一定要承諾，佢唔做廿三條。

454
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:08,840
我都覺得係冇咩好要再拗落去㗎啦，即係都係立場嘅問題。不過就冇唔認，你你唔使幫佢解話，就話誒唔關事啊噉樣。議員就係懷疑關事。

455
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:22,330
要落嚟支持你，支持你快啲清曬所有嘢，為咗解決我哋香港長遠嘅問題，立廿三條你就鬧你啦，你啦呢個位我實支持你嘅，放心，主席。朱凱迪議員三分鐘。

456
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:28,490
阿陳志源議員，你個例子其實不適當，因為點解咧？而家佢係冇得揀㗎嘛，政政策局叫佢做乜佢做乜。嗱，你話佢就算你唔加人畀佢會點咧？到時咪淨係做廿三條第二章唔做啫嘛？你明唔明啊？即係噉樣佢佢個情況，你哋問嘅嘢真係真係無謂咯。不過你講得啱啊，我最或者同意你一樣嘢就話。

457
01:25:50,240 --> 01:26:10,250
根本話佢佢根本唔知道會唔會做D嚇，係咪先咁？所以如果我哋有個合理嘅懷疑，而通過個討論係令到我哋嘅懷疑覺得好大機會嘅，咁唔支持或者要支持一個宗旨係好好正常。其實梁美芬議員頭先講都啱嘅，佢話：如果係咪如果誒修訂婚姻？

458
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:40,250
我覺得梁美芬都有居唔支持喎。啊，如果你講到明話係做強積金對沖或者好合理，懷疑佢會做嘅時候，如果唔知自由黨唔支持佢，佢唔支持好好合理嘅喎，嚇。咁但係我哋話唔係唔係應該糾纏落去，我係同意。如果已經釐清咗就係咁㗎啦。佢係有機會，有機會做D，D係有機會。

459
01:26:40,250 --> 01:27:00,260
三條噉啊，講完㗎啦。其實嚇就投就投反對票咯，噉樣嚇。但係主席，你唔可以誤導你啲啲啲市民。我講好簡單例子嗱，你唔中意啲仔女打機啊，即係話爸爸畀五千蚊我買嘢，跟住你問你係咪攞去買誒遊戲機啊？我唔係，我係誒我自己使用啫。噉樣噉，你會唔會買遊戲機啊？

460
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:36,670
你明唔明嗰個嗰個比喻就係就係噉樣啊？主席議員你可以搏嘅，即係以即係其中一個考慮就係我而家開咗個位，你要做呢件事，我哋維你呢件事噉。我而家畀多咗子彈你，畀多咗人力你嚇，你咪可以更加快做得更加所謂更加好喺你哋嘅嘅立場嚟。

461
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:56,680
我哋就話其實，如果你人力更加緊，噉你即係啊十個煲得五個蓋，噉啊望你就唔唔開果擠住噉樣。咁呢個又係好好合理嘅嘅要求嚟嘅。我我相信經過呢一轉嘅誒終止代續嘅討論，同埋如果專員可以再講一次。

462
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:48,780
討論夠啦，要表決啦，好簡單。何俊賢議員，你講咗我想講嗰樣嘢啊。頭先如果嗰個細路仔話買遊戲機係佢自己嘅決定嘅話，咁唔使講啦，你梗係有嘅反對嘅理據啦。但係問題律政司做乜嘢？唔係佢話事啊嘛，立例係特區政府整體嘅決定嚟啊嘛。咁所以咧，我你頭先嗰個。

463
01:28:48,780 --> 01:29:08,790
個細路仔買遊戲機畀五千蚊佢咧，係不適用嘅。咁其實我咧亦都好少去去做一啲政治嘅投票。不過頭先啱啱聽到咁多嘅議員講，哇！如果你唔清咗啲嘢，佢就就我就係要你清唔曬啲嘢，等佢唔做二十三條。誒，如果你噉樣講，我我又覺得有道理喎。點樣做咧？我而家就係。

464
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:22,090
我哋唔係因為話佢唔答呢個問題，所以係要提出終止嘛，而係當陶錦山議員喺上次會開始咧，即係打開咗呢個話題之後，睇個文件，亦都我我認為律政司未解到點解你要寫國歌法作為二零一八年嗰個。

465
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:01,510
何君謠言。

466
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:34,300
係唔係要增加？

467
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,200
一係咧，就叫林鄭講。

468
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,310
噉我諗翻嚟之後，大部分同事對呢個位。

469
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:44,570
一個人手，而增加呢個人手咧，係已經有一啲工作係就住誒二十三條立法做準備啦。呢個問題咧。

470
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:59,890
加多支筆，等佢續快啲嘢，就唔會有太大嘅疑問啦。所以我喺而家呢一個狀態底下，我係支持呢個終止嘅議案嘅。

471
01:30:44,930 --> 01:31:01,800
我都同意啊，主席就係而家律政司坐喺度嘅人咧，就算佢知道咧，佢都答唔出。咁邊個答得出咧？噉啊，再高級啲嘅咯，一係就負責嘅嗰個局就係保安局，噉啊叫李家超講。

472
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:25,830
咁而家既然呢個就變成咗，我唔係淨係話不畀你好似買支筆噉樣嘛。法律草議就係買支筆，買多兩支筆噉樣去去寫字，唔係淨係一個工具啊嘛。我哋變成一個政治問題嘅爭拗嘅話，噉我覺得就不如喺今日就。

473
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:45,840
逼大家去表態啦，因為可能係，可能又唔係噉啊。應該將呢個問題咧，就交翻畀而家話得事嘅嗰啲官喺二十三條問題上面話得事嘅官去講翻句説話，就住佢呢個位噉，我覺得咧，我哋就誒釋除大家嘅疑問，噉就可以翻嚟。

474
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:22,510
主席啊，即係越拗佢哋啊越糊塗。實際上咧，雖然係糊塗啊，但係佢亦都已經承認咗一樣嘢：你冇權噉樣限制住專員話，如果我加咗啲人手之後，人手之後啲副專員同埋兩個助助助手，以後唔能夠掂邊條條例啊！就算你要問啊李家超或者問特首都好，噉佢。

475
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:42,520
都唔會，佢都唔會話我，我我同你達成嘅協議啦，加呢個位咧，我就唔會掂二十三條。噉我呢個起步點已經係錯冇個法律嘅根基。你你完全係過分嘅呢一個樣嘢，根本唔合適去問呢個問題。咁所以而家你條你條氣唔憤氣就話喂，你好似冇講得咁清楚，但係專。

476
01:32:42,520 --> 01:33:02,530
專員佢自己係講，我只能夠講到我嘅嘢。不過而家你都承認一樣嘢，話佢頂籠係講咁多啦。唔該，你同我問埋特首李家超會唔會將來呢個副專員會幫手整二十三條嘅時候，係係係畀個答案你。如果佢畀個答案你話有可能嘅喎，唔通我請嗰啲公務員翻嚟坐喺度食飯㗎？

477
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:22,540
呢一個二十三條係立法係已經既定咗㗎啦，不過時間表係未未有。如果有的話，將來要做有乜問題啊？呢個位即係你你唔好喺呢度混淆咗先。突然之間逃緊身，就好似發現咗一個哥倫布發現新大陸噉啊！其實就戇居居噉啊，真係個專員係佢佢做技術專專員，佢係愛嚟去。

478
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:42,550
起議草擬法案㗎嘛？你你送咩法嚟過去？有個政策上佢就要做㗎啦。呢個係個任務嚟㗎嘛。咁但係二十三條係咪任務？咁唔單止係任務，係一個係一個憲制嘅責任。但係今日同呢個位係完全未扯上關係。不過多謝你提出嚟。噉我如果認為話就就算。

479
01:33:42,550 --> 01:34:02,560
係今日專員，佢講可能唔應該講都講埋，有可能噉我都會完全支持，舉腳贊成添。噉啊，真正佢要開個會喺二十第二十四段同第二十八段裏邊寫得好清楚，工作量大。我哋過去嗰十年八載啊，嗰啲答看看看獻出嚟嘅嗰個法例嘅業數越日日。

480
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:22,570
都都增加法例係越嚟越複雜。佢想講畀你聽，我係唔夠人手啫，係高聲噉樣已經嚟去求救。但係你就話你唔準做二十三條。佢而家都未得人同你做二十三條。馬上如果佢開兩個副專員嘅位，我就會話我畀添啊！謝多謝。我反對呢個終止嘅誒誒辯論嘅動議。好啊，阿。

481
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:23,330
即。

482
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:29,380
啊，係。

483
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,080
嗰嗰啲人啊！

484
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,020
打五分鐘，唔該。

485
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:54,100
如果冇咧，阿～

486
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,460
歐樂軒，請你發言答辯係一分鐘。

487
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,020
嗱，就冇其他委員禁制。

488
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:13,690
二零一八一九七廿三個文件，要唔要打鐘？

489
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:48,130
特政司處心想事情，主席，我反對呢個終止議案。O K，好。

490
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:10,150
而家仲要諗下，究竟呢個法、呢個呢個噉樣樣嘅開位係咪真合理咁解？時間夠啦嚇，我現在將下述議題付諸表決，本委員會決定終止議程項目FCL。

491
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:43,890
聽聽唔到啊！阿謝麗，我我想問下大家傾咗咁耐，又係而家又要中止個，都傾到咁上下，大家都冇可能對方同我哋依方面咧，係大家可以傾到一個個解決個辦法出嚟，我。

492
01:36:44,230 --> 01:37:03,620
我提議咧，就係一一提完呢個票咧，我哋就係要入學另外嗰邊投票，好唔好？唔好再畀佢講啦，主席。唔係咁咁唔係唔畀佢講。不過我哋我打算都係差唔多時間。你你嘅觀察好正確，因為三個幾鐘。係因為你再講落去都冇咩意，大家已經就離題萬丈啦，已經。係啊，啱啊。

493
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:42,580
葉劉淑儀議員，主席啊，我覺得律政司處答得好差。人哋問你又多啲資源會唔會準備做廿三條？你應該話我永恆都準備做廿三條，因為係憲制責任啊嘛。特首禁制我就做，我送葉建源嘅徽章畀你，祝你。

494
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:19,410
開開始啦，係咪啊？啊，請講下。首先多謝各位發言嘅議員啦。咁誒，我唯一想回應陳克勤議員嘅，因為陳克勤議員誒好關心啲學型申請誒處理唔到，不過我都要再次講，呢個民事訴訟組嘅新增職位咧，就唔係負責做學型申請，開咗。

495
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:39,420
位都處理唔到嘅工作，呢個就係我否決嘅原因，我反對上會嘅原因。第二就係關於嗰一個即係工作量嘅問題。噉啊律政司嗰邊又覺得佢要做好家嫂，就同大家講話工作量好多，要分擔緊啲。不過大家不如試下到底諗一諗。

496
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:59,430
啊！由八八年開始個編制去到今日都未加過，噉佢哋係咪都要真係認下錯咧？係咪要為咗過往咁耐以嚟冇加個位剝削啲同事，搞到而家工作量咁大，咁先至走上嚟上會係承認下自己錯誤咧？我希望我哋唔好借同事過橋，但。

497
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,680
係啊！

498
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:55,170
打中。

499
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,640
呢個真嘅。

500
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:19,960
你有中意邊個？

501
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:42,270
邊位？

502
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,820
打五分鐘。

503
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:19,170
好啊！現在開始表決。

504
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:26,290
現在停止表決，顯示點會結果？

505
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,380
咁誒，我哋而家仲有冇邊位要提問？

506
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,790
啊！我講咗啦，啊太遲啦嚇，誒有冇人要打鐘？

507
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:39,920
如果冇咧，本人將F.C.由二零一八一九七廿三年點付資畀佢。

508
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:54,000
如果冇嘅冇咧就啊打五分鐘，唔該打五分鐘。

509
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:36,390
阿何君堯議員，你會唔會再問啊？我唔問啦，講咗啦。

510
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:32,430
十三票贊成，三五票反對，五票棄權。我宣佈咧，建議遭到否決。

511
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:23,930
唔係，仲有人，仲有仲有人要問嘅，但係都一兩個啫。問完咧，我哋就投票啦。如果冇曬。

512
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:47,100
好啊！首先提一提大家咧，我即將處理就係咪即係誒中止呢個項目啊？大家係咪支持中止呢個項目先啊？

513
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,180
嗯。

514
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,760
建完又翻咗嚟喎。

515
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:09,140
好啦，現在開始表決。

516
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,480
我係等佢哋坐低先。

517
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:52,180
嘅營運等等。

518
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,550
打五分鐘表決鐘。

519
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:16,320
現在停止表決，顯示點嘅結果。

520
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:30,260
改善財政狀況，確保考評局咧可以持續運作。

521
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:21,660
贊成卅六票，反對十四票，四票棄權。我先冇見獲得通過，我要進入下一個項目。

522
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:48,730
為咗解答大家問題咧，財務委員會咧有以下官員列席：楊潤雄局長啊。

523
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:06,040
現在我首先請教育事務委員會嘅主席啊葉建聯議員咧，係彙報事務委員會討論結果。啊葉議員。

524
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:58,260
大家我即將投票咧，係咪支持開呢個開呢個律政司民事法律科同埋法律草擬科各開設一個首席政府律師嘅崗位啊？

525
01:48:52,470 --> 01:49:09,180
此外咧，係事務委員會通過兩項嘅議案，促請當局考慮以經常撥款形式為文憑試校學校考生支付同成本相若嘅考試費，以減輕考生嘅經濟負擔同埋考評局嘅營運成本。

526
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:41,700
一個項目FCL二零一八一九七十四號文件，請委員會咧係批准一筆為數三億六千零八萬嘅申請金額，用以支持香港考試局同埋評核局由二零一八年九月一號至到二零二二年嘅八月三一號四個年度有效嘅運作。

527
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:26,380
誒主席誒，首先祝各位新年快樂啊！啊誒主席誒，教育事務委員會喺二零一八年十二月七號嘅會議上面咧，討論以一筆個撥款誒資助考評局嘅建議，委員咧係支持呢一行嘅過渡措施嘅，並且認為咧當局應該咧係制定時間表，研究可行方案，協助考評局咧改。

528
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:50,550
委員提出嘅建議包括咧，第一誒就係檢討一直錄得虧損嘅香港中學文憑試嘅營運模式，第二咧亦都監察咧考評局嘅營運開支，誒第三咧就為考評局咧制定開源節流嘅措施，第四咧以及咧係成立基金支持考評局。

529
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:45,650
誒。

530
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:05,540
有關嘅問題咧，會持續惡化嘅。

531
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:42,640
學校考生咧係提供資助，咁呢個動議咧亦都獲得教育事務委員會通過嘅。

532
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:16,430
政府當局嘅書面回應已經隨住立法會嘅誒文件咧，係送交全體議員嘅。

533
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:44,410
繼續營運，有效咁去做嗰個文憑試。第二個問題，亦都係好多議員關心嘅，究竟應政府應唔應該資助曬所有考生嘅考試費？咁咧就誒。

534
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:32,000
而家政府一筆過去撥款畀考評局，而又唔向非本地考生收回成本價咧，即係用公帑咧去補貼非本地考生。

535
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:19,030
費咧並唔實際，噉我想誒當局明白呢個其實係一個原則嘅問題嚟嘅。嗱，而家文憑試嘅收費並唔係按成本去收嘅，即係文憑試一定程度咧係要由考評局去補貼。

536
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:43,150
我哋教育事務委員會即係誒通過嘅呢個動議，恆常資助所有學校考生係咪一個可以考慮嘅方案之一咧？噉樣。另外咧，誒喺當日嘅會議裏邊咧，誒。

537
01:52:46,230 --> 01:53:03,770
我哋喺文件度已經講咗咧，喺第一個問題裏邊，我哋有個四年嘅時間表啦。我哋喺四年裏邊希望可以解決到呢個問題，就係話考評局長遠點可以達至到收支平衡咧？誒，長遠係咪都需要政府嘅資助？如果真係要嘅話，政府資助嘅模式係點咧？

538
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:37,430
好啊！第一位嘅陳志全議員五分鐘係誒喺十二月七號啦，即係舊年嘅教育事務委員會嘅會議裏邊咧，我就曾經提出咗一個動議嘅，係要求誒政府每年按每名學校考生嘅文文憑試成本開支，直接咧向學。

539
01:49:42,920 --> 01:50:02,930
喺教育局嘅回覆裏邊咧，就話當局亦都承認目前考評局嘅營運模式同埋成本結構咧，未能支持考評局長期營運文憑試，導致該局嘅財政困難，難以維持有效運作同埋繼續舉辦文憑試，而且咧預計。

540
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:25,830
噉啊就話考評局正與政府協商研究可行嘅方案，以確保其財政可長遠維持。現階段係咪有定案？咁第一個問題就係，我想問下局長有冇一個時間表嚇，話畀我哋知幾時先至可以研究到一個可行性方案，而我？

541
01:50:43,700 --> 01:51:03,710
就我話誒，因為文憑試係國際認可嘅考試，即係當局話嚇誒，因此非本地人都可以嚟考，但係因為非本地人咧佔嘅比例咧好少，所以咧如果向佢哋即係向非本地人額外收。

542
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:52,290
即係更加諷刺嘅係，而家考評局負責嘅其他國際認可考試咧，個收費又可以係誒超過成本嘅喎。咁當局咧先至可以用其他國際認可考試嘅收入咧嚟補貼翻文憑試。咁既然國際慣例都冇話以公

543
01:51:52,290 --> 01:52:12,300
公堂去資助一啲非本地生考本地嘅市嘅噉，當局可唔可以即係調升啊？呢個如果佢唔係揸香港身份證嘅咁嚟考文憑試嘅考生，唔止收回成本添啊，即係賺佢都仲得啊！即係係確保唔會出現我哋公堂。

544
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:32,310
講去津貼一啲非本地考生去考文憑試咧噉啊，局長誒主席，我或者誒，因為時間都唔多，好快咁嘗試去解決個問題誒。我哋而家有誒，目前長遠嚟講誒，經過同議會嘅討論咧，我哋有兩個問題要解決。第一個咧，點樣長遠令到考評局可以誒？

545
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:03,220
主席。

546
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,600
啊！

547
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:02,530
噉我知道咧，我哋嗱，我自己都係教育界。

548
01:54:52,520 --> 01:55:01,730
嗰個券咧就唔係由政府資助嘅，係由非嗰啲非國際性考試嗰啲錢咧去資助嘅。如果你要噉樣睇都可以嘅，我未分完五分鐘。

549
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:14,830
教育局建議要畀三億六千萬畀考評局咧，喺個大方大方向嗰度咧，我係會支持嘅。

550
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:32,020
喺呢段時間裏邊，我哋亦都可以考慮埋咧，即係話，譬如係咪誒本地生、非本地生，尤其是如果係政府畀錢去。

551
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:58,630
查出嗰份卷，你就會追翻究竟佢係啲人要求啲人點教係咪？然之後就再睇翻咧，就係學生、老師同埋社會點睇。

552
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:28,950
咁咧誒，我哋有誒開記招去批評咗咧，第二年咧就會少啲，我哋認為係不不合當或者唔適合高中生去考嘅，或者擺落去必考題嘅。

553
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:16,940
咁喺有啲科目嚇，即係譬如通識科，我哋一路咧都係提出，我哋睇到份卷係唔掂。每一次即係誒一個誒公開考試卷出咗嚟。

554
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:47,450
誒，我記得我關心幾科啦，過去嚇就係呢個高級文憑試啦，嚇中文科同埋通識科。誒，其實我哋咧就係睇嗰個output嘅啫，嚇我哋啊，除咗睇嗰份卷。

555
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:31,120
但係咧，我一定要咧跟進咧，就係考考評局，即係作為我哋都係啊公堂去支援嘅咁重要嘅考試嘅機構咧。我認為現時嚟講啊，佢哋嘅運作咧係欠缺透明度。

556
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:21,920
咁誒，但係經過上次嘅誒，即係議會嘅喺教事務委員會嘅討論之後咧，我哋係會喺考慮嘅同時咧，將議員嘅要求話政府係咪應該要承擔曬所有學生嘅考試費一並去考慮嘅，會喺喺嗰個時候一並會考慮。

557
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:52,490
誒，畀本地生考試嘅時候，我更加唔會畀非本地生。咁到時嗰個究竟係點樣咧？我哋會一評考慮喺呢四年裏邊咧。我覺得我哋嘅睇法咧，就係話我哋維持考評局用而家嘅運作，因為而家點樣定考試費，點樣收唔同人嘅考試費咧，係由考評局自行決定。雖然。

558
01:53:52,490 --> 01:54:12,500
佢每一年都要嚟問一問我，去加呢個考試費，我畀唔畀？噉我就與其我喺呢度再糾纏呢四年中間，究竟譬如非本地生個數目唔多，究竟應該加多幾多咧？我哋而家嘅提議就係呢四年用現行嘅模式去運作四年，我哋一次過去解決曬所有呢啲嘅問題，然後喺四年之內咧。

559
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:32,510
有個長遠嘅方案咧，係會誒提交出嚟畀誒大家去考慮。主席，我講多一句嘅啫。阿局長，我同意佢。如果由政府畀錢，冇理由要誒政府去資助一啲非本地考生。咁其實今日我哋批呢嚿錢都係一樣嘅，都係政府畀錢，都係未來咧，都係呢四年。李局長話變唔到啦，但係我哋都係做緊同樣。

560
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:52,520
嘢係政府畀錢去資助非本地學生。主席可唔可以著少少回應？我話聽講嚇嗱，誒可以噉樣睇。而家個誒文憑試咧係由其他國際考試去畀嘅。噉你誒如果令你安心啲嘅睇法咧，你不如當咧誒嗰啲非本地生咧，其實佢多。

561
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:57,470
但係。

562
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:34,590
嘅一啲議題嚇，譬如誒。

563
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:49,350
佢哋好多識答嘅咧，就係話：我唔明白佢裏邊講乜嘢。

564
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:34,460
噉啊，停幾年咧，淨一一一唔睇咧，又出翻嚟嘅。

565
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:42,580
所以我要即係我一直要跟進嘅，即係我哋社會人士、公眾畀咗咁多嘅意見。

566
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:44,650
誒，我仲記得有一條就係民主指數與經濟競爭力嘅關係。我拎呢條問題去問啲高中生。

567
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:59,270
我只需要學識點答題目。而家啲老師都係講㗎，答題目識答就得㗎啦。睇嗰個表唔需要了解個內容㗎，嗰度可能當係外語噉樣都得㗎。

568
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:55,640
我好明白出卷梗係要保密啦嚇，我亦都同意佢哋一定會係好認真。可能嗱誒有有啲國家你直情係關門一個月，大家係完全都唔接觸外界嘅，呢啲我哋係理解嘅。

569
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:11,130
點樣去有回應到社會對某啲學科嘅咁嚴峻嘅批評？譬如通識科，我本人喺教育界，我提出咁多次，點解唔可以取消咗個必考題？

570
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:16,290
呢個正正就係通識科相反嘅方向，所以我經常話：點解唔可以檢討嗰個？首先係咪一定要咁考試？好啦，考試係咪一定要必考題？連學生選擇範圍都唔畀咧？

571
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:31,470
嚇！除咗佢必考題，以往曾經試過連續幾次都係問一啲高度，我認為不恰當嘅政治議題，要逼學生一定要回答嗰啲範圍嚇。如果唔係佢肥佬啦，係咪啊？嗰份卷你你你必考㗎嘛？一係咧，突然間咧就係問一啲咧，我覺得係唔適合高中生。

572
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:37,210
點樣考評局點解唔回應咧？噉我唔知有冇考評局啊？考評局有啊，蘇博士喺度，願唔願意係聆聽社會意見？將來會有修改，可能唔係你嘅，你可能係新去到呢個崗位，即係我希望瞭解你哋嘅態度咯。我批呢嚿錢，我都要覺得即係我信啦，係咪啊？嚇，好啊，或者我。

573
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:57,220
我請阿蘇博士去講一講考評局點樣回應社會上邊唔同嘅意見。好啊，阿蘇博士。好啊，多謝主席，多謝梁議員嘅提問。誒，考評局出題目嘅時候咧，其實都要參考誒課程同埋評核指引，即係呢個喺文憑試誒成立嘅時候咧，就透過誒課程發展嘅專家。

574
01:58:57,220 --> 01:59:17,230
同埋平日嘅專家一齊嚟定嘅，咁所有個出題目咧都一定要基於呢一個嘅誒課程同埋平日嘅指引嚟到出嘅。咁而我哋每一次出咗題目之後咧，亦都會考慮誒蒐集誒唔同持份者嘅意見，然後先至會喺新嘅一年嘅題目裏面咧，就會再誒參考呢啲嘅意見。

575
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:37,240
嘅噉，所以誒頭先誒梁議員提出嚟啲嘢，一定係其中一個參考嘅其中一個部分啊。咁當然長遠嚟到講喺未來嗰個發展誒考評嗰個題目點出咧，都係要參考呢一個嘅指引。噉我都知道，即係如果係喺課程檢討誒有大嘅修改或者點樣都好啦，即係呢個都一定要。

576
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:49,050
十分鐘。

577
02:00:42,030 --> 02:00:47,490
好啊嗱，聽到意見我哋會跟進。好嘅，我哋已經開兩個鐘頭會，我而家暫停會議。

578
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:41,750
嘅唔諗學生係點樣，或者社會點樣睇？呢個係一座大山。我希望教育局咧，你係要代表即係公眾咧，都一定要將你嘅意見反映，同埋要有改進咯。

579
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:09,210
誒誒，未來出題嘅時候咧，繼續作為參考嘅。但係我聽講啊，嚇，我都揾過一啲以前做過委員，即係我覺得佢話嗰裏邊好，即係好自己係誒。

580
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:57,250
再去到誒課程同埋平日專家一齊去討論，然後先至可以去釐定嗰個方向。噉我諗喺而家嘅情況咧，我哋出嘅題目誒仍然都係跟足呢個平日指引咧，就我覺得已經係誒回應到誒唔同示範者嗰個意見。當然頭先梁議員提出嚟啲意見，亦都會繼續喺我哋嗰個嘅。

581
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:29,840
自成自自成一派噉嘅，即係係好defensive嘅。對於外界嘅意見係唔會變嘅。總之就係我哋就係噉就係咁㗎，連你你畀啲comment咧都好難會更改，即係好似一座大山噉啊！如果話幾座大山，教育界嘅大山可能考評局裏邊點樣出卷，點樣擁抱呢啲考試嘅模式，成日覺得自己呢個模式係最正。
