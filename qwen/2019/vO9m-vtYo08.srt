1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,090
梁繼昌議員。

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,060
立法會主席。

3
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,460
to fill the vacancies.

4
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,210
which is unparalleled in other parts of the world.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,920
extension of retirement age amendment bill，2019。

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,940
The supply and demand for judges are great.

7
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,070
The independent judiciary is a spine of our rule of law.

8
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,720
and this necessary entail enough good quality trained judiciary.

9
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,360
但係，有兩個因素，which would affect the attractiveness of the bench。

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,160
The reason why I say this place is unique because we have developed a bilingual judicial system.

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,230
Mr. President, I'm here to speak to give my support to the resumption of second reading of judicial officers.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,850
As we all know, Hong Kong is a unique place to provide legal service to international business community.

13
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:56,010
now the supply of top quality common law judges is a problem in many common law jurisdictions, not just mentioning Hong Kong.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:15,440
但係，也係事實，如果更多國際公司選擇香港法作為 govern law，和 govern jurisdiction。

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:04,330
Now I'm not just talking about this based on the fact that we are the prime arbitration centre for commercial disputes in Asia.

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:29,030
under Hong Kong courts, that would mean Hong Kong's legal business community and the professional services sector as a whole will benefit from this choice of law.

17
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,460
now in。

18
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,780
to be。

19
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,260
first of all。

20
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,070
和benefits。

21
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,210
或，Independence of the judiciary。

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,430
lucrative professional job to take on the bench.

23
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,280
Hong Kong's judiciary remain independent, but this, you know.

24
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,220
在過去22年，後的回歸主權到中國。

25
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,990
Some circumstances, this statutory retirement age could further be extended.

26
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,340
now，taking the two points I've mentioned about the prestige of joining the bench。

27
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:26,010
now one one of the very key component of good judiciary is independent.

28
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,660
這些 legal practitioners, many of whom are very experienced lawyers, who have given up a very

29
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:18,090
the prestige of the bench. Secondly, the benefits we are going to reward.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:03:01,130
and the main crunch of this bill extends the retirement age of the high court judges, court of appeal judges and court of appeal judges and the final court of appeal judges to seventy, and in

31
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:56,220
Very good quality is coming to a lot of encroachments, especially when judges have been criticised in many media by key opinion leaders, politicians, columnists, etc. I think.

32
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:48,880
now of course this bill which extends among other things which extends the retirement age of the top court judges put us on par with the arrangements for many other common law jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.

33
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,600
has to be very low key.

34
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,710
now，having。

35
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,600
and in return for that.

36
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,320
We will have a very respectable.

37
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,130
and like most common law jurisdictions.

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,540
and prestigious judiciary，that is the key point.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,210
他或她有個非常高的標準來 observe。

40
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,360
fix the benefits and tenure of the judges is one thing.

41
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,190
now normally speaking， the judges in this jurisdiction is， you know for life.

42
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,650
Now of course talking about benefits, that will include tenure of judges.

43
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,100
and to maintain the independence, integrity and the prestige of the bench is another.

44
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,030
A judge to be living this life. A judge leads a very low profile life.

45
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:19,390
not just not to make comments in public about current affairs, but his social life, personal life, family life.

46
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:27,700
now, most recently I've read a very alarming report prepared by the

47
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:53,620
The tenure of judges in Hong Kong are guaranteed lifelong, of course, unless the particular judge has committed a very serious, you know, misconduct.

48
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:46,630
Foreign Affairs Committee of House of Commons of the UK concerning British judges' British judges' role in Hong Kong's top court, and the headline is they are very concerned about the erosion or the perceived erosion of the one country two system.

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,550
has been handled by the government.

50
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,350
and， of course。

51
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,070
它意味著，equality。

52
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,520
Treatment of all people before the court.

53
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,910
從英國、澳洲和加拿大政府。

54
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,070
Of course, it also mean a system.

55
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,290
and which will lead to the actual or perceived.

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,240
and my understanding is that these common law jurisdictions.

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,690
now this is quite alarming, Mr President, as you know the committee has pointed out.

58
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,090
erosion of the one country two system and hence the independence of the judiciary.

59
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:16,420
and， the committee also further recommends that there should be a coordinated response.

60
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,680
It means accessible to independent legal representation at an affordable cost.

61
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:56,820
外務委員會的英國議會也非常關心關於最近的危機。

62
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:32,350
also supply the judges, the overseas non-permanent judges of our top court, the CFA.

63
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:06,860
The rule of law, as mentioned by my learned friend Regina Ip in this chamber, meant a lot of things. It means an independent judiciary.

64
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,310
The bench.

65
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
and the second more important point I have mentioned.

66
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,840
Too much protectionism to enter the profession.

67
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,930
of law which affords basic protection to human rights.

68
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,700
That once you become a judge, you cannot go back to private practice.

69
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,950
of judiciary to this city. One is the benefits and tenure of.

70
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:06,010
and it is a lifelong commitment, and you have to lead a very quiet life being a judge in the high court.

71
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:41,100
這些係核心價值， enlisted by the honourable Lord Bingham in his very famous book《The Rule of Law》，which I have read many times。

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:24,190
now there are two criticisms about the supply chain. I shouldn't say supply chain because it is a bit degrading. As a supply of good quality lawyers to fill the bench, mainly in this city, there are one.

73
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:47,610
now for example if you're a graduate of even you're a graduate of first class honour holder from Cambridge or Oxford when you come to practice or when you come to enrol the PCLL course in this city and only three universities here offer the PCL postgraduate certificate in law courses.

74
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:27,460
兩位講完，我覺得你離題啦，因為我哋唔係講緊PCLL嘅。我哋而家係而家係講緊二零一九年司法人員延展退休年齡嘅。請你翻返嚟呢個題目好嗎？哦，this piece of bill itself is not sufficient to deal with。

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:57,990
the the recent incidents of course have been quoted by many of my colleagues that it is a demonstration of the erosion of the rule of law, but I totally disagree with this point because these are incidents of breaking the law, but these are not incidents of breaking the rule of law.

76
00:07:41,710 --> 00:08:01,720
嗱，我哋有好多議員咧，都。I'm not surprised that Mr. President, Mr. 我哋今次嘅辯論咧，就係講二零一九年司法人員。

77
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:21,730
延展退休年齡，我亦都係聽咗你係好耐咧，都係離開依個題目。請你翻翻嚟依個題目。Okay, the supply of the judiciary. I have talked about you know two points, which I think, Mr. President, you have totally missed my point because two points will increase the supply.

78
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:53,170
It's about integrity and and prestige of serving on the bench, which you have totally missed the point. And thirdly, now I come to increasing the supply of you know experienced lawyers joining the bench, which is more of a problem because as you know, and has also mentioned by my many learned friends.

79
00:09:48,590 --> 00:10:08,600
still， you have to go through quite a ridiculous conversion course， and I have to say I have to declare my interest because my one of my children is pursuing a law degree and is becoming a lawyer soon。 but despite that fact that even a first class graduate from a first

80
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:47,750
the supply of the judiciary in this city, because merely extending the legal retirement age will solve the immediate problem, but not the long term problem of filling the judiciary, and we have to remove many of the artificial.

81
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,880
裁決。

82
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,880
遠離咗，請你翻翻嚟，亦都係收回你嘅指控。

83
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,450
如果你唔收為你嘅指控咧，我就會需要。

84
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:55,500
你係判決，我唔係問你判決，因為我係講緊我嘅法案，我話咗要增加供應嘅律師。因為你係指控我，請你收回你嘅。

85
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:09,990
子雄，I am saying the yesterday of your treatment on the tax concession bill and this bill is different. Is it an allegation? I do not think it's an allegation. I'm stating a fact。我現在暫停。

86
00:10:47,750 --> 00:11:06,270
Protectionism to enter the legal profession. Okay, of course. I mean, I I think, Mr. President, you have using been using two yardsticks because as we remember, you have allowed people to speak on all subjects. 啊，梁繼昌議員，你係指控我。

87
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:26,560
係用兩把尺，係咪？請請你講，你係咪指控我係用兩把尺？我希望你收回依樣嘢。因為今日今日依個辯論咧，我係用同一把尺，我亦都係提醒你，你係。
