在 my capacity as member of the advisory committee of corruption.

6
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,390

fighting corruption is a long-term and uphill battle. The ICAC continues to adopt a three-pronged strategy, combining law enforcement, prevention and education in the fight against corruption.

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:10,600
In November 2008, the ICAC sent experienced trainers to Myanmar and Cambodia to conduct training programmes for officers of their anti-corruption agencies.
