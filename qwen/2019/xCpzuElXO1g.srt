12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,570
法律事務部就二零一九年仲裁委任仲裁員及調解員決定嘅修訂規則。

13
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:25,330
關於二零一九年仲裁豁免委任仲裁員及調解員和決定仲裁員人數嘅修訂規則。

00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:41,140
我哋可以啊，而家就試試，因為咧，我哋人數唔算多啦，咁所以可能都會畀足夠嘅時間畀大家嘅。

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:17,200
我提醒各位委員，要披露任何與二零一九年仲裁委任仲裁員及調解員和決定仲裁員人數修訂規則有關嘅直接或間接金錢利益。

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:55,910
噉我哋係會逐項審議條文嘅，嚇，亦都係咧就係啊小組委員會如果完成研究有關規則嘅政策之後咧，我哋咧就會係逐條審議。

17
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,920
係。

18
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,030
好。

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,850
我知道。

20
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,720
工作中心緊張。

21
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,550
Are you going to speak?

22
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,730
係，委員，如果有人想。

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,070
Thank you very much.

24
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,980
即係聽日可以討論嘅。

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,580
嘅秘書長啊，Miss Sarah Grima。

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,320
O.K.好，咁咧就誒，我諗我哋咧就係誒正式。

27
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,280
誒，我第一陣先嚇，我都要問一問啊，秘書先。我哋如果延展嘅呢個嘅討論。

28
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,390
就會係最遲聽日進入會務討作出討論㗎。係即係，只不過係你噉。

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:03,790
啊！並且要同大家宣佈咧，就係根據委員喺上次會議商定，我作為小組委員會主席。

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,940
誒，劉橋先生同埋李天恩政策專員係誒，睇下邊一位係咪Miss Sarah Glima？

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:15,160
將會喺聽日六月五號立法會會議上動議將規則嘅審議期延展至二零一九年七月十號。

32
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,550
waive the fee in in certain cases.

33
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,410
There are three other proposed amendments that are primarily technical in nature.

34
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,980
That our equivalent HKIC may move ahead and make a decision, and we would move that.

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,860
I'm sorry, I didn't. I didn't hear the translation of your introduction, so.

36
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:46,210
The third amendment that we are moving is that the

37
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:24,980
第一是，H.K.I.A.C.有能力 amend 任何的時間限制，那目前適用於規則。

38
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:47,950
在一些案件，會似乎適宜HKIC有權豁免那筆費用，對於案件的爭議金額較小，例如。

39
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:46,140
I will introduce the proposed amendments. Yes, briefly, briefly, very briefly. After your introduction, we would go through the regulation.

40
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:45,010
That be a discretionary decision to allow us more flexibility in terms of situations where it may not be appropriate for us to move forward and make a decision.

41
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:37,820
This can be important, for example, where a party has not complied with the current time limits and, for example, requests an extension. This is very normal in how we operate under our rules, and really is a matter of our internal process.

42
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:37,210
at the moment, for a party to an arbitration to request a decision from HKIAC, HKIAC must charge a fee of Hong Kong dollars eight thousand for any request.

43
00:05:46,490 --> 00:06:04,710
The provision with respect to the delivery of documents or the service of documents under the Cap 609C be amended to align with the delivery of documents under the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance. At the moment, that is not compatible.

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:24,350
那係，我們想插入一個新規則，第13/2A，根據這個規則，HKIAC有權豁免任何申請人根據《香港仲裁條例》作出裁決時所須繳付的費用。

45
00:03:46,420 --> 00:04:05,520
provision by provision, yeah. Okay, understood. Well, thank you very much. The proposed amendments that the HKIAC is seeking to introduce for Cap Six Hundred and Nine C fall into four main categories, but there is one main amendment that has motivated the proposed amendments.

46
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:11,000
誒，宣佈會議開始。宣佈會議開始之前，我自己都要誒陳述啦。我都係誒有做仲裁嘅工作，亦都係誒有做仲裁員嘅工作嘅。咁呢一度咧就係簡單説明一下。誒，而家咧我哋就請誒香港國際仲裁中心。

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:05:08,260
和，what we find in our experience under our cases is that we have, for example, one dispute where more than one decision is required from HKIAC and the party moving for the decision is required to make two payments of 8,000 Hong Kong dollars. So we would be seeking to have the power to

48
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,300
係。

49
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,420
no，it's a one-off fee。

50
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,070
understand what we have been, yeah.

51
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,470
那係個總結，係四個主要嘅建議修訂。

52
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,490
Our powers under the ordinance are only applicable where Hong Kong is the seat of arbitration.

53
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,290
嚇，定係有有案件嗰個range嗰個嗰個誒數額嘅分別㗎？

54
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,870
correct，the eight thousand Hong Kong dollars applies to all cases，no matter what the amount in dispute is。

55
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,630
That is correct, and it would also be an incentive for parties to opt for Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration.

56
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:56,700
咁咧就誒嗰個八千蚊就係誒一次，即係每次而家最基本收八千蚊嘅係嘛？最基本嘅費用嚟嘅。

57
00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:01,530
O.K.嗯，咁咧就誒，我哋誒而家現時呢一部分咧，都係喺政策上嘅，睇下委員有冇問題。

58
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:35,850
first of all decide the number of arbitrators and then come back and and request the appointment of an arbitrator. In that scenario, they would have to pay the fee twice.

59
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:54,930
即係每一次有一個決定就要畀八千蚊，誒唔根據嗰個案嘅一個誒誒牽涉到嘅數額嘅，因為我記得有時我哋做嗰啲都幾貴幾貴嘅，佢係幾十億嗰啲誒商業嘅紛爭，其實佢都係同樣嘅收費嘅。

60
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:22,780
咁即係話，如果而家你哋有酌情權去豁免咧，就其實亦都可以令到一啲面額更細嘅案件咧，係被吸引佢可以誒，即係都選擇我哋香港嘅仲裁嘅中心作為紛爭解決嘅一個選擇。

61
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:26,570
The final amendment that we are proposing is that HKIAC have the discretion to make a decision after the expiry of certain time limits. At the moment, in two places in Cap 609C, it is provided that HKIAC must proceed to make a decision. In two other places, there are.

62
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:21,830
啊，或者咧，我自己都想問清楚少少嘅啫。誒，好多謝阿誒Miss誒Grima頭先嘅簡介啦。咁咧就頭先你提到咧就係話嗰個可以有權力去豁免誒八千蚊嗱，因為我希望誒Miss Grima誒或者其他嘉賓都誒代表都理解。

63
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:41,840
係啦，我哋希望公眾咧能夠跟進我哋嘅討論，所以咧我都會盡量係會用誒廣東話，都起碼大家聽會嘅時候咧就會知道我哋討論緊嘅重點嚇。咁所以可能誒一定要聽嗰個耳機，you might need to rely on the S I啊， to

64
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
香港 much more attractive.

65
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,380
所以， first and foremostly， it would be a benefit to Hong Kong as the seat.

66
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:46,240
some of the feedback that we have received over several years now is that.

67
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,420
誒通常係咪細到會唔會係得幾萬蚊到十幾萬噉樣？會唔會係呢啲咁細嘅數額？

68
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:56,950
因為 of the fact that we have to charge this fee, no matter the size of the case, when compared with say other venues that are popular for maritime arbitration, for example London.

69
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:15,940
誒，我想啊，Miss Grima又解釋下，或者其他都可以補充嘅，係係誒，係咪因為海事仲裁通常又係數額係比較細啊？

70
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:09,200
咁所以嗰啲亦都可以，當然可以係好大面額，好大面額嘅，因為牽涉到保險，咁可能大家就會牽涉到賠償，究竟係邊度？咁香港其實我哋個海港係好活躍嘅。

71
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:40,010
It is true that this proposed amendment would benefit maritime arbitration and that it would make Hong Kong more attractive as a seat. One of the motivations behind this proposed amendment is feedback from the maritime arbitration community as well as the construction arbitration community.

72
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:35,580
我補充少少喺誒二零一五年咧，我係舉辦咗我自己有份舉辦嘅一個誒國際研討會喺啊，係講到一帶一路嗰陣時，亦都有一個新嘅思路係See係Water嗰個嚇。

73
00:09:46,020 --> 00:10:05,310
係誒有一啲啊討論咧，就係話呢一個而家呢個修訂咧，係會對於海事仲裁，即係嗰個啊發展，即係攞咗海事仲裁業務（maritime arbitration）啊，亦都會係啊增加一個吸引力。

74
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:26,140
Under the ordinance, HKIC can make three decisions. We can appoint an arbitrator, we can decide on the number of arbitrators that the parties have to agree, and we can appoint a mediator. So a party can come to us asking for one of those decisions. In some cases, a party may need to come to us in the same case to take two decisions. For

75
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:17,240
the fee charged for appointing an arbitrator in London by the London Maritime Arbitration Association is lower than our fees, and so in order to make us more competitive and more attractive as a venue, then being able to waive the fees in certain types of cases in low cases where there is a low amount in dispute would make

76
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:55,870
咁咧就其中一個國際嘅專家都有提到咧，就係話啊，其實海面上咧誒，如果講緊一大誒嗰個誒即係sea belt啊嗰個海上嗰個嗰個途徑咧，就會有機會出現誒海盜嚇，即係真係會有人搶咗海上嘅貨啊噉樣。

77
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,100
數字。

78
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:31,080
Workers, international trade cases, and sometimes there's quite a lot of overlap between international trade and maritime cases.

79
00:14:49,560 --> 00:15:04,320
可以有機會，正如我哋講，而家降低即係個收費可以免埋啦。我哋應該有機會會搶多幾多個case咧？唔知你哋會唔會有啲噉嘅估計嘅啫？嚇，即係唔知有冇係啦？唔該。會唔會有啲數字畀我哋參考咧？嗯。

80
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:29,490
啊，如果有近嘅紛爭，能夠我哋誒吸引到海事仲裁，係能夠由細係去到大，即係慢慢我哋可以有機會係準備好啲，我哋多啲呢啲專才咧。誒，我覺得係誒好事嚟嘅。噉我雖然我覺得可能係唔需要申報嘅，不過都會誒提及一下啦，因為成大咧。

81
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:49,500
係喺幾年前咧，有開到一個海事仲裁嘅研究中心嚇，噉係我啲同事去做嘅嚇。我係做商事仲裁嘅啫。噉我覺得，如果將來係可以係鼓勵多啲新嘅新嘅仲裁員，佢可以涉足海事仲裁，或者將來會有好大嘅面額嘅紛爭，係唔出奇咯。

82
00:12:49,500 --> 00:13:09,510
嗰個發展，OK，噉我就見到啊，周浩鼎議員想問問題嘅，啊，請周浩鼎議員。係誒誒，唔該，主席。咁對於目前今次即係豁免呢個收費安排，都正如頭先Screamer都解釋啦，都係希望能夠可以增加我哋本身香港個本地嘅仲裁中心嗰個。

83
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:29,520
個誒競爭力噉，我相信呢個都冇爭議嘅，都係好希望做好件事啦。誒，我就想問下咧，因為頭先亦都聽到咧，關於個海事仲裁嗰方面咧，即係而家就誒頭先聽到就話，可能倫敦本身嘅收費都比我哋低嘅。咁而家我哋誒再積極啲啦，咁咁唔知有冇一啲？

84
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:49,530
啲啊，過去啊，你哋掌握嘅數據，即係比如話，可能喺倫敦本身一啲小額或者做嘅海事仲裁，佢哋嗰個case嘅數量大概係點？又或者我哋而家自己本身過去啊一段時間裏面誒喺你哋掌握到嘅數字裏面，我哋自己做海事仲裁嗰個大概嘅case。

85
00:13:49,530 --> 00:14:09,540
嘅數量係幾多咧？誒呢個一個小問題啦。咁另外一樣嘢咧就係誒都係一個意見啫。咁而家因為高增值航運業咧，我自己本身就比較關注嘅。咁誒海事保險咧，政府就已經業回應咗業界訴求咧，就今年開始咧就減税。噉啊，亦都呢個咧係呼應。

86
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:29,550
翻我哋一路都希望咧，係成個高增值航運業咧，就正正包括船泊租任啊、船主啊、船東啊、誒誒海事保險啊，或者仲裁、仲裁就係啱啱而家我哋講緊啲節啦，能夠儘量吸引喺香港度做，或者佢哋喺呢度落户咧，噉啊可以成個產。

87
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:49,560
產業集羣咁形成咧，噉啊，如果做到咁咧，噉啊，真係有助於香港成個產業同就業個安排嘅。所以我就比較關心，即係唔知道可能同時會唔會有啲基本數據已經話畀我聽，即係過去嘅一段時間，我哋嘅海事仲裁機制係幾多，或者你哋可能預計啊，我哋同倫敦嘅比較未來係咪？

88
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:25,310
Of course, thank you very much. So every year, HKIAC administers between two hundred and fifty and three hundred arbitrations, and last year, fifteen point one per cent of those cases were maritime cases. So that gives you a sense of it's an important sector in our work, and also some of a large sector of our.

89
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:51,370
I don't have the specific figures for the London Maritime Arbitration Association, but they are much higher than ours. But they are also much higher than any international arbitral institution in the world. They really are the leaders. So they run into I think it's even into the thousands per year, but I would have to check that. So I think that.

90
00:15:51,370 --> 00:16:11,380
What steps we can take, we should take to attract more of these cases to Hong Kong. And I'm glad that mention was made of the Belt and Road initiative, because the government's policy, of course, is that Hong Kong is a is a leading venue for dispute resolution for Belt and Road disputes, and we do see that reflected in our caseload. We've started to see some.

91
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,950
嗯。

92
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,420
誒，嚇！

93
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,690
and express power, so there is no issue.

94
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,110
在 practise， we do move out. we do

95
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:43,990
no discretion，即係以前係完全冇呢個酌情權，係延期噉。通常出現咩情況，我哋真係變咗冇得做啦。係遲點樣出現呢個問題？

96
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:33,660
may, if the circumstances of any particular case so justify, amend any of the time limits under the rules. Of course, that would not apply to time limits that the parties themselves have agreed upon, which we would we would be obliged to respect.

97
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:59,970
收唔到啦啊，或者有黑客收唔到啦噉，係需唔需要有合理嘅理由咧？定係就誒呢個算係誒差唔多必然嘅，有機會可以延期咧嚇？Thank you。

98
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:25,160
唔知可能spaming啊，又可能係太多啊，成lock資料，即係你全部用電郵啊嘛，咁好多文件十幾二十個，咁可能即係有啲都會係話係收唔到，咁即係話以前其實都有呢個酌情權嘅，而家就將佢明確。

99
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:50,930
得好，第三點啦。頭先講送達請求誒，現你話而家修改咗之後就會劃一誒，以前係唔符合唔符合乜嘢啊？我唔知有冇聽漏咗，所以我想你講清楚少少。

100
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:09,770
明即係即係現時咧，其實都有喺個別，如果佢有合理嘅解釋嘅情況底下咧，你哋都會容許嘅。因為我舊我以前做嘅一啲仲裁咧，的確就算用電油咧，都可能係話收唔到㗎。

101
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:31,390
海峽爭議出嚟，和也，我們有最高數量的案件，係中港中國公司和非中國公司，和那一直係HKIAC的標誌，和重要部分的案件，係在海事領域，所以那給你一種感覺。

102
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:52,840
好嚇，係好，周浩鼎議員。誒，我就係啦，咁唔該曬同事咧。咁至少我哋而家睇到，即係起碼我哋都有相當份額嘅誒數字，佔咗我哋所有嘅份額裏邊咧，都係做海事仲裁嘅。咁當然我哋都其實清楚知道咧，香港同同倫。

103
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:12,850
咧喺海事啊，maritime business方面，成個產業嚟講係好難比，因為佢哋真係而家全球嚟講，無論係海事保險啊、仲裁啊，或者所有嗰啲啊shipping finance嗰方面咧，都係領先嘅。咁好難話攞我哋香港即刻去同佢比較。不過誒，我同意咧，即係。

104
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:32,860
我哋都係以一個高嘅誒水平作為一個目標啦，希望我哋點都可以慢慢追上啦嚇。因為新加坡都係好喺呢方面好積極，咁所以我哋而家都怕落後啊，所以而家都要加緊咁去做。噉我諗我係呢個意見啫，冇其他㗎啦。唔該啊，主席。好啊，我我自己都有畀啲資料，我早早。

105
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:52,870
其應該九九五年已經係有協助，even內地上海啊、北京啊，佢哋係海事仲裁嗰啲啊工作嚇，同埋啊出版嘅宣傳嘅。咁所以我諗，我哋係加強啦。我哋自己啊一個幼苗咧，我相信係可以成長嘅，而香港嘅。

106
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:13,010
人才嘅實力嚇好誒嗱誒，我另外仲要想問清楚嘅，其實我想喺政策上了解咗咧，我諗我哋陣間逐項條文咧，其實就未必需要好花好多嘅時間，因為我哋都希望今日就可以搞掂曬佢嘅。如果我哋啊，所以你就啊好清楚簡短咧，我啊。

107
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:33,020
誒誒誒講咗畀我聽嗰個答案就可以㗎啦。誒第二個你提到嘅建議就係話時限嘅規定喺內部誒就而家經過呢個修訂就可以延期嘅，有噉嘅係咪內部有個權限？係咪未修定係唔可以啊？定係延即即係咪absolute？

108
00:18:49,390 --> 00:19:09,400
We do act outside the strict time limits that are under the sub legislation at the moment, and so that's a matter of internal practice. And what we're seeking with the amendment is to make that express that that is not an issue, and that would mean that we would not have to face arguments from parties saying that that is within our power or not.

109
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:29,410
under the current sub legislation, what the time limit is that I'm specifically talking about is the fact that we must give the respondent party fourteen days to submit comments on any request. That is something that we always do. We must adhere to that. It may be, for example, that a request is served on a respondent and the respondent

110
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:49,420
Let's us know that it has only received the request say one day before it is required to make comments. In that situation, it is advisable to give the respondent more time to make their comments, which would then inform our decision. So that is what we are already doing. But this amendment is seeking to make that.

111
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:45,550
係咪？亦都可能係咪？現在明確呢個延期可以批准延期嘅酌情權，需唔需要有合理嘅即係理由咧？即係好似我剛才講，我哋有好多電郵嘅往來，但係文件量太多，有時都塞咗，即係即係直情啊塞咗車啦！喺喺電郵係。

112
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:20,430
Thank you. To be clear, in the current sub legislation, it is not precluded. We're not precluded from extending the time limits. It's silent, but you are correct that we would only be seeking to extend time limits where the case so justifies. So the wording that we are proposing is that HKIAC.

113
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,840
啊。

114
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,000
嗯。

115
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,250
on page five.

116
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,130
And again, under Rule Ten, Subsection Two B.

117
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:25,340
Profession by profession, your recommendation of amendment. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I will move through page by page.

118
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:43,050
咁其實係咪應該由首席仲裁員佢都可以去做決定，定係由直情係由你哋去去做決定咧？

119
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:43,270
嗯，咁如果一方唔同意咧，覺得誒另外一方係不合理嘅要求。

120
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:54,970
before the constitution of the tribunal， it will be HKIAC。OK，嚇，即係喺喺行政嗰方面咧，就係你哋要做咗一個決定㗎啦。

121
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:34,610
嗯，但係誒喺呢啲批，譬如雙方有爭議啦，唔想延期，一方入一想需要又提供咗理由，一方咧就唔想啦，梗係啦，因為對不嚟咪可能延長咗。

122
00:24:46,660 --> 00:25:04,630
由相關費，這裡我們提出要插入，如果適用，這會然後連結到權力給我們放棄。這個提出的變更是重複，也，在第8條第2B節，這是2頁上。

123
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:13,710
yes a very typical example would be the one that I expressed before where for example we receive a request from the claimant and then that is delivered to the respondent but within the 14 day period perhaps late the respondent may write to us and say we need more time to make our comments or we may hear from the legal

124
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:33,720
或respondent to say we have only just been instructed by the respondent we need more time to review the file and to come back to you with our comments in that situation we would extend the time limit a reasonable amount not to hold up the proceedings but a reasonable reasonable amount to ensure that we obtain the information.

125
00:22:43,620 --> 00:23:03,630
噉嘅時候，你哋係咪就要作出一個決定嚇？噉你譬如譬如平時嚟講呢種噉嘅決定，就係要畀使唔使畀八千蚊啊？呢啲唔使啦，係嘛？呢啲唔需要㗎啦。

126
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:23,640
almost，very，very，common，very，common，so，we，make，that，decision，all，the，time。That，kind，of，procedural，decision，is，not，something，that，the，party，would，have，to，pay，for。The，party，only，needs，to，pay，the，8,000，when，they，first，lodged，their，request，for，the，appointment，of，an，arbitrator，for，a，decision，on，the，number，of，arbitrators，or，for，the，appointment，of，a，mediator。

127
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:17,690
That's correct. OK，好誒，仲有冇委員發問？如果冇咧，我哋就進入逐項審議啦，好冇啊？咁逐項審議咧就係誒，首先誒請香港國際仲裁中心協助委員開始逐項審議規定。May you help to brief um our members to follow。

128
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:46,660
on the first page, the first proposed amendment is to insert the what the words in parentheses, if applicable. This relates to the first proposed amendment with respect to the power to waive the fee. You see here that under Rule Six, Subsection Two, the request must be accompanied.

129
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,080
嚇！

130
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,960
係啦。

131
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,820
okay。

132
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,210
所以係喺頁六。

133
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,060
按照本條例第十條。

134
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,110
係講緊第十條係講緊乜嘢？

135
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,610
呢啲咧有冇可以提提個第十條？

136
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,330
好，啊，有冇委員有問題？

137
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,630
10 of the Hong Kong Ordinance, and then if you compare

138
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,940
按照本條例第十條。

139
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:56,480
因為我哋嘅法例咧係中英文版都係啊一樣生效嘅，就唔想中文版有太大嘅出入。

140
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:27,420
then if you turn to page six of your document, then you find the central change which would give effect, give HKIC power to waive the fees.

141
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:14,120
Rule 6, subsection 3A, you see that it is written that the service will be to the last known address or addresses of the other party.

142
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:38,200
Yes, thank you. So, Section 10 sets out how a party is to deliver documents to the other party. It provides that

143
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:49,490
誒，我哋都要因為有啊中文版，可能誒法律顧問亦都係啊，我哋一齊咧都要啊，我哋點樣都要睇一睇嗰個中文版嗰個對應嘅，咁所以咧，我哋有時會停一停嘅，噉樣咧就啊。

144
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:58,490
Documents will be served on the other party at the the personal address of the other party, or at the place of arbitration, or at the party's habitual residence or their mailing address. So those are the options that you have under section.

145
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,130
所以。

146
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,480
啊。

147
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,530
嚇，page two。

148
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,200
Okay, you give the discretion.

149
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,400
係，因為因而家有好多方式㗎啦。

150
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,060
係嘛？即係話證明送達咗就得㗎啦。Correct。好。

151
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,550
好，咁咧就係跟住係誒零零零二第。

152
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,220
and there you will see the inconsistency between the sub legislation and the ordinance.

153
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,100
which says for the purposes of subrule three, double registered post constitutes good service.

154
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,750
Here is the introduction of the word may instead of must. You will see that the rule provides.

155
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:32,080
The thinking behind this provision originally is that, notwithstanding that the other side does not respond, we may move forward.

156
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:05,170
Thank you. There is one other change to on page 0001, which is the deletion of rule 6 subsection 4.

157
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:28,620
我們 propose to remove that because that has raised confusion by parties as to whether or not double registered post constitute is the only way to constitute good service, which is not the case.

158
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:20,000
currently that if no information is received within 14 days after a request by HKIAC to the respondent party to the request, HKIAC must proceed to make an appointment of an arbitrator.

159
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:56,000
咁咧就誒呢個都係隨住社會改變啫，即係有唔同嘅方式去送達我哋嘅相關文件係啊認可㗎啦，喺法律上都好，我哋應住就係第二頁啦，好冇啊？就進入嗰個七配胡四係。

160
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:41,340
嗯，所以由making reference to section ten of the ordinance， we bring the sub legislation。其實係咪應該更早咧？更早就寫按照條例，因為誒unstable model law呢個憲法誒示範法係好重要。其實應該係更早做呢樣嘢嚇。OK，我冇意見嚇，改翻呢個。

161
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,320
however，它currently worded that we must move forward.

162
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,940
我們 may wish to not move forward， and I can give you an example.

163
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,770
put the case into abeyance. We take note of that and we do not move forward.

164
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:18,500
在那場景，我們唔會 wish to move forward with an appointment。 我們想有機會可以 hold that。

165
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:57,320
case where the case goes into abeyance and into a dark hole that no one can see. We are always in contact with the proceedings.

166
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:11,130
在那間時間，claimant writes to us and says we would like to suspend our request because we are in settlement talks with the respondent.

167
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:44,740
你都要去押判咗嗰個仲裁員，即係我瞭解下啫。夏州浩整賢問得非常之好，因為仲裁好重視嘅係程序。

168
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:46,510
在其他地方在《子法》中，它被寫成「我們可能向前走」，而我們認為「可能」更為優先，因為有幾種情況。

169
00:29:51,400 --> 00:30:02,040
say you have a situation where a claimant has requested that we appoint an arbitrator. We write to the other side and we give them 14 days to submit their comments. We do not hear from them.

170
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:55,040
係係好，周浩鼎議員。誒唔該啊，主席。誒其實啊，Miss Grima解釋得好清楚嘅，因為我頭先都諗緊呢個幫點解要改翻嚟，但係又衍生咗另一個問題，我請教下。好似你頭先講嗰個scenario咁啦，嗯。

171
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:37,540
所以那係一個例子。所以呢個變動係要首先同其他法例領域對齊，特別講《規例九三》用到「可」字，而《規例十一四」，你唔見喺呢份文件入面，亦都用到「可」字。

172
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:28,300
at any time, if one of the parties would like the case to resume, then they have the power to unilaterally resume the proceedings because there the agreement for suspension has finished. So the moment a party moves us to then move forward, we move forward under the applicable rules.

173
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:15,330
原來有啲情況，可能佢話：喂，原來想又可能是哪一方想suspend想停一停咁好啦。咁按照你大家既然有噉嘅意願，噉我就唔proceed住啦嚇。我may may may wish to not proceed，噉我咪停一停咯。咁但係喺呢度，如果變如果以前寫must咧，你就見到啲時間限制就真係。

174
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:35,340
見佢一定要咁啦，但係而家因為未咧，你某程度上就嗱，因為容許佢有咗個option啊嘛，我可以延一延啦。咁但係就冇一個係咪冇一個time deadline嘅咧？即係冇一個時限嘅誒誒，即係係啦，會唔會仲有一個時限嚟？你最長只能夠延到幾時咧？我明白。

175
00:31:45,140 --> 00:32:05,150
時限噉，我哋呢個酌情權去到幾多？即係如果唔係咧，大家有冇機會濫用咗呢一個誒延展又延展、延期又延期咧？即係雙方嚟講嚇，即係仲裁嘅程序係係最好重要㗎嘛嚇。Yes, great嚇。The way that we manage this kind of scenario is where the parties agree to

176
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:49,210
In terms of practicality, how do we manage the time limits? When a case is in abeyance, we provide a time limit to the parties to give us a status update as to what is happening in the case, and that way we always have a point in time at which we are seeking the parties' information as to what's going on in the proceedings, so that there there is no

177
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,150
得。

178
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,240
係。

179
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,170
five。

180
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,120
噉，噉。

181
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,240
有冇問題？

182
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,950
佢會議細B嚇。

183
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,240
OK，得consistency啫。

184
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,930
如果冇去零五啦，零五頁page。

185
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,450
嚇，好，咁跟住我哋落去零零零四頁第九。

186
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:40,020
again，this is the same change made again，insertion of the rule may instead of must。

187
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:08,160
啊！主席，主席一句啫，啊都好清楚嘅，即係如果係噉，都唔會話好似頭先阿Miss Kima講，我唔知去咗。

188
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:21,710
and then reference to section 10 of the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance and deletion of the double registered post language.

189
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:13,350
On page three, we have the repetition of the two changes that were mentioned on the first page. So the insertion of the of the words if applicable.

190
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:24,510
去咗唔知邊度咁遠，都一路唔搞，都都唔會嘅。咁純粹我只係一個問題請教下啫。誒，既然即係你哋處理好多經驗啦，通常呢啲情況，就算真係有咁發生，現下咁假設咁做啦。誒，大概係咪可能？

191
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:58,350
嚇，不過我嘅經驗都是嘅，有啲拖得好長啊。就算我自己參與嗰啲，總之大家都係拖咗好耐。啊，咁咧就誒好，咁跟住如果第二冇問題，就第三頁啦。嚇，第三頁嘅二B八。

192
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:41,880
三幾個月、半年點都應該處理到阿pond到咯。我呢個純粹一個瞭解嘅啫，合合理嘅時間嚇。Yeah, time. It depends on the case. Usually, we would put put in place a time limit of between one and three months to check in with the parties. Yeah.

193
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,980
是。

194
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
okay。

195
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,280
okay。

196
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,590
Capital A。

197
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,670
yeah you actually.

198
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,950
Okay, then page six.

199
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,430
未嘅未charge eight thousand for making。

200
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,370
所以，其實，係consistent。你你 keep the discretion。

201
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,680
The appropriate threshold would be cases under 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars.

202
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:56,530
And again, here on page five, we see the three changes that are consistent with the previous changes we've discussed.

203
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:52,820
That wording we would propose to keep as it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I can see from thirteen.

204
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:33,820
誒，我就其實都睇到咧，喺十三一嚇thirteen subsection one咧，就算係未改嘅時候，你哋用嗰個字咧都係。

205
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:16,130
頁六是 where we find the principal amendment and that is insertion insertion of reference to subrules two and the new proposed amendment two a.

206
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:54,050
proposing to do is to practice is to publish a a guideline with respect to the kinds of cases that we would consider waiving fees, and that would be measured according to the amount in dispute in the particular case. We have studied the

207
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:36,420
which is set out just below there, which says that the HKIAC may, if it considers reasonable in any particular case, waive any of the fees referred to in sub rule one. So that there is the power for us to waive fees if we consider reasonable in any particular case. For your information, what we would be

208
00:35:54,330 --> 00:36:14,340
applications we have received under the ordinance between 2015 and 2018 to determine what would be an appropriate threshold, both in terms of making a meaningful contribution to to users, but also ensuring that financially speaking, the impact on HKIAC would not be of concern, and we have determined that.

209
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,720
啊。

210
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,080
誒。

211
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,960
Okay.

212
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,360
批文。

213
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,520
logistic.

214
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,340
much earlier.

215
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,510
Yeah, good.

216
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,070
Okay, yep.

217
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,690
We also have to update it.

218
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,460
Check, correct. Okay.

219
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,630
So then go to page seven.

220
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,630
Okay, then let's go to any question.

221
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,980
Those are repeated on pages eight and nine. Because check.

222
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,050
係咪？係

223
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:03,840
have answered our question here, right? I have exactly what we discussed exactly just then, yes.

224
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:33,210
頁七反映我們會引入到形式，當事人必須填寫的表格。當他們提交申請時，這些是與當事人需要勾選和通知如何繳付費用有關的非常形式化的變更。

225
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,230
Okay.

226
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,170
yes。

227
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,140
你覺得需要？

228
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,010
decision number。

229
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,220
用另一個表格。

230
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,200
表格二。

231
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,180
哦，好啊，好啊，好啊，得啊，你畀埋。

232
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay，呃，page eight。

233
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,740
Okay，嗯，then is page nine。

234
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,020
Yeah, this is the same change. Yeah, with respect to a form three application. Yeah.

235
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:31,360
Okay, okay, good. Yes, our legal consultant has some questions.

236
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,540
你以前咪用表格二啊？用表格，what what form did you use? You mentioned form two.

237
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:53,810
啊！好多謝法律顧問啦，法律顧問咧就提出咧，就係喺啊一。

238
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:12,990
所以，depending on which request has been submitted, you fill in a different form. Okay, all right, yeah. So it's consistent with before. Correct, it's the same change. Yeah.

239
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:03,140
所以有三forms that are relevant. Form one is for the appointment of an arbitrator. Form two is for a decision on the number of arbitrators, and form three is for the appointment of a mediator.

240
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:28,260
This is this is the same proposed amendment to the the relevant form. So this is the form if you need a decision on the number of arbitrators, it's form two. This is the form that the party would fill in, and so there we're also amending to update with respect to payment method.

241
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,090
嚇。

242
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,410
嚇，OK，啊秘書話唔係五月廿四號，係三十一號。咁其實因為，

243
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:38,040
We've worked well with the Department of Justice with respect to the timeline that would apply, and so that we believe would be the appropriate date.

244
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:22,510
八區嘅區議會同埋兩個專業團體同埋委員咧，睇下佢哋會唔會有啊？

245
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:13,190

00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:31,110
Sure, thank you very much. That date is motivated by a calculation of the time that it would take for the legislation to be approved or through to pass through the process at at this body, and so with a view to
