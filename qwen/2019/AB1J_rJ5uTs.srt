1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,810
各位早晨。

2
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,920
上星期六。

3
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,750
我已經就呢個安排。

4
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,380
我留意到過去幾日。

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,500
就二零一九年逃犯修訂條例草案而言。

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,310
要求當局澄清條例草案裏邊嘅細節。

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,910
我哋已經喺上個星期五向政府發信。

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,700
請佢哋考慮內務委員會所發出嘅指引。

9
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,170
詳細咁書面向全體議員解釋。

10
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,040
內務守則同埋秘書處一貫嘅行事方式。

11
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,320
議員就秘書處嘅做法有唔同嘅意見。

12
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,950
秘書處一直以嚟咧，都係不偏不倚咁服務議會。

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,450
呢個安排同樣係根據議事規則。

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,290
秘書處係向法案委員會嘅所有委員以書面嘅形式。

15
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,940
秘書處協助議會審議法例嘅工作咧，從來都係政治中立嘅。

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:40,160
政治中立呢個原則咧，秘書處以往、而家同埋將來都會持守。

17
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,390
嘅一個。

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
秘書處從來。

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,420
係。

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,510
都以有則改之。

21
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,550
無則加勉嘅態度面對。

22
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,170
聚焦處理手頭嘅工作。

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,690
秘書處希望將時間同埋精力。

24
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,460
甚至係近乎欺凌同埋滋擾。

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,200
至於一啲善意嘅批評同埋提點。

26
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,580
呢啲言論同埋行為對秘書處嘅同事係極不公道。

27
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,410
逃犯條例草案嘅審議仲有大量工作要做。

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,270
但我同時亦都留意到，有啲人嘅批判言論同埋行為。

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,280
我希望有關人士馬上停止攻擊同埋傷害秘書處。

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,540
我想首先感謝連日嚟支持同埋鼓勵秘書處嘅所有議員。

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,860
我更加要感謝緊守崗位、默默耕耘嘅所有秘書處同事。

32
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:43,760
我哋會一如既往獨立專業咁協助議會處理條例草案嘅審議。

33
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,360
一個先係有。

34
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,540
你個車？

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,370
就係點解係一？

36
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,400
啲問題冇解決。

37
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,730
因為呢個應該係。

38
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,990
我都覺得。

39
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,100
我想問下你，而家室誒嗰個。

40
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,000
即係應該就邀咗幾個委員會。

41
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,450
即係因為佢寫明，所以又非常。

42
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,990
分鐘誒咁耐都唔去。

43
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,380
第二個就係我睇咗條新聞嗰個回應啦，但係留言。

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,610
咁誒律師信嘅內容，我哋係需要同誒法律部門去商討啦。

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:28,120
誒，我首先答誒你第二條問題先啦。誒，琴日誒早上咧，誒我係收到有議員誒對我發嘅律師信。

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:48,290
咁誒，所以我我哋我哋確實誒未能夠出席冇預先安排嘅會議，咁誒先對誒等咗好耐嘅議員講聲唔好意思。

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:04:09,560
咁咧，第第一個你頭先問嘅問題咧，其實我已經誒書面好詳細咁向所有議員解釋啦。噉啊，書面嘅誒誒書面嘅解釋同埋個嗰個通稿咧，已經喺上個星期日發出。噉我喺呢度冇進一步嘅補充啦。

48
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:58,830
誒，亦都答第二條問題先啦。誒，確實誒，就係唔係開會去誒處理誒發誒呢個內會畀誒範委會嘅指引咧？我哋喺我哋嘅書面嘅解釋咧，亦都詳細講咗啦。咁誒，我喺呢度真係冇進一步嘅補充啦。誒誒，至於。

49
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,720
好重。

50
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,410
我冇打到，就係。

51
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,300
做啲乜嘢？

52
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
我玩嘅時候就。

53
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,230
相關相關嘅。

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,420
嗰個需要，包括你嗰。

55
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,580
同緊新兆威第二次換嘅，繼續公司換。

56
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,630
會唔會考慮佢哋成日都要求話要選擇呢樣嘢？

57
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,190
咁但係如果喺個真空狀態嘅時候，點解氣栓全部？

58
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,710
比比依張其實咧，你嗰個你話書面嘅回應咗啦，但係成即係琴日點解咁大爭議，就係好鬼遠。

59
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,350
同埋亦都畀佢定嗰個第三次嗰個時間，咁誒同埋誒物業費其實唔係揾咗你。

60
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,410
同緊新主持首次會議之後，個法案委員會就處於一個冇規則嘅真空狀態，所以你就用呢個宣傳嘅方式，就呼問啲議。

61
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:17,210
於誒誒，尋日下晝誒，其實誒石禮興議員已經指示咗誒秘書處咧，就改咗誒上本來原定誒琴日開嘅會，噉啊將會呢個會將會喺星期六進行，噉啊有關嘅通報亦都已經發出啦。

62
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:21,030
誒，首先誒答咗你第二條問題先啦。誒，我哋喺誒我哋嘅書面嘅解釋嗰度咧，已經講咗誒成件事嘅發生嘅過程，包括咧就係第一次誒法案委員會開完會之後，第二次誒法案委員會嘅會議安排，我哋。

63
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:41,040
確實已經喺誒書面裏邊解釋咗，咁誒書面嘅解釋咧，我知道係誒有唔同議員有唔同嘅意見嘅，咁誒確實呢個係一個好負爭議嘅問題，咁誒我容許我喺呢度唔再作詳細嘅解釋啦。我哋根據誒一。

64
00:06:41,040 --> 00:07:01,050
路以嚟，我哋嘅誒誒嘅專業嘅獨立嘅判斷，誒睇咗議事規則、內務守則，同埋我哋參考咗我哋一貫嘅行事方式咧。我哋將詳細嘅誒做事嘅解釋已經用書面嘅形式誒列出嚟，所以喺呢度我真係冇再進一步嘅嘅嘅。

65
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,180
四零。

66
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,150
佢快過。

67
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,230
即係。

68
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,740
嗯。

69
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,930
即係嚟嗰個集團。

70
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,090
咧，點就係咧？

71
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,990
清楚究竟係乜？

72
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,450
資料事件係邊啲人？

73
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,440
同埋你頭先，你嗰個發言。

74
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,230
令咧，啲水質中氯性依啲實質。

75
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:38,560
誒會議咧將會改期喺誒星期六舉行，咁誒呢方面我哋嘅立場亦都十分清晰啦。

76
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:29,820
誒，好似我頭先誒答回答另外一位誒朋友嘅嘅誒問題嗰陣時，亦都講咗啦。我哋琴日按石禮謙議員嘅誒嘅指示咧，其實已經好清楚咁誒交代咗嗰個會議誒，即係第三次嘅法案委員會嘅。

77
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:25,310
答你誒第二條問題誒，秘書處一路持守嘅都係一個誒政治中立嘅原則。誒立法會係處理好多政治誒好誒好受爭議嘅一啲嘅法案誒，同埋一啲議題。秘書處一直以嚟咧都係。

78
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:45,320
係以誒政治中立呢個好重要嘅原則，同埋以我哋專業獨立嘅一個態度咧，去處理嘅。咁誒秘書處做嘅所有嘅安排誒，大家有目共睹誒。可能有唔同嘅議員有唔同嘅意見誒，我我。

79
00:08:45,320 --> 00:09:05,330
喺呢度咧，希望咧，大家都係誒聚焦，可以畀秘書處可以翻翻嚟聚焦我哋眼前嘅工作。因為呢個逃犯修訂條例咧，確實係有好多爭議嘅地方。噉我哋上個星期五咧，其實就誒已經發信畀政府，羅列出一係列希望。

80
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,360
一少少。

81
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,900
唔同。

82
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
中立性嗰個問題。

83
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,420
你個責任其實。

84
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
多謝。

85
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,150
呃，嘅地位喺社羣媒體，and，how。

86
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,490
回到進入的階段，會唔會有啲事情發生？

87
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,210
專業獨立咁去支援佢哋完成呢個審議嘅工作。

88
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,310
We have always upheld our political neutrality.

89
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:39,410
我答到，冇答到。其實你琴日喺唔喺立法會度，同埋其實你頭先問到就係，其實你覺得而家嘅情況。

90
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:17,110
As I have said in the opening statement in Chinese.

91
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:55,610
知道誒條例草案有佢嘅一定嘅複雜性，我哋係我哋嘅團隊而家係確實係需要翻翻嚟聚焦做翻我哋手頭嘅工作。

92
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:25,340
政府澄清嘅問題，其實裏邊包括好多係誒一啲具體嘅細節，我哋係需要誒去研究嘅。咁所以，我希望所有議員都誒可以翻翻嚟講呢個誒條例草案嘅內容。咁秘書處咧係會一如既往噉。

93
00:09:44,140 --> 00:10:04,150
我其實頭先答咗嘅誒，頭先咧，我亦都誒講咗。我哋琴日喺收到誒律師信之後咧，我同我嘅同事同埋誒誒法律部嘅同事咧係去研究誒律師信嘅內容，所以真係未能與誒即係未未預預先約定嘅。

94
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:24,160
議員開會，噉我喺呢度同佢哋講聲誒唔好意思。咁誒誒，至於我哋誒做嘅一路嘅安排，我頭先講咗我哋背後嘅原則同埋我哋嘅理念誒誒，當中當然係誒針對呢個負爭議嘅議題咧有。

95
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:45,190
議員有唔同嘅意見，有市民亦都有唔同嘅意見。誒，我覺得如今嘅我最希望嘅咧，就可以容許我哋誒秘書處我哋嘅團隊誒能夠聚焦翻我哋眼前嘅工作，因為睇到我哋誒上個星期我哋提出嘅問題，大家都。

96
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:43,600
Over the past many many years, ever since the Secretariat has come into existence, we have always worked against this principle. We have dealt with very controversial issues. We have used always endeavour to use our best professional judgement.

97
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,940
different。

98
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,610
我哋嘅，因為。

99
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,970
The guidelines.

100
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,140
我我 notice that.

101
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,410
On Saturday, we responded.

102
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:45,420
We will always review ways that we can do our work better, but for comments that are

103
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:52,460
And independent thinking to serve the council and its all its committees.

104
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:22,090
From list of questions, those details are important and needs to be thoroughly thought through.

105
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:37,360
to the House Committee's decision to issue a set of guidelines to the Bills Committee, and we have accordingly.

106
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:36,200
Members have expressed different views on what the secretariat has done. Different

107
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:53,720
faction's have different opinions on what we have done. First of all, I like to thank all the members who in the past few days have expressed support and given us enormous encouragement. I am deeply grateful.

108
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:36,510
If I may continue, I have also noticed that there are criticisms for what we have done. For those constructive comments, we have always taken the attitude that if there is something that we can improve upon, we will.

109
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:12,750
What we have done last Friday was to issue a letter to the Security Bureau, hoping to clarify a number of questions relating to the details of the bill. As everybody would understand.

110
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:57,820
Based thinking on the rules of procedures, house rules and past practices, we issued in writing a circular to invite all bills committee members to consider.

111
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:20,260
In doing so, we have made reference to, as I said, what we have always done, looking at the rules of procedures, the house rules, and acted according to our past practices. What I have.

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:14,010
I am also very grateful to all my colleagues who have stood fast amidst all these controversies and acted according to their usual high professional and work standards.

113
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,010
係。

114
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,490
構成。

115
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,920
其實大。

116
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,900
誒標小費錢。

117
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,480
嘅哮喘症。

118
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,530
Is that because?

119
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,820
Also, can you state very clearly that?

120
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,500
兩份itation，或者two allegedly。

121
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,890
You are not trying to seek the source to.

122
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,130
your circular beyond to say you are following the rules.

123
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,640
urge such comments and actions.

124
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,320
almost bothering on bullying, I.

125
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:08,700
to cease right away. What the secretariat need to do now is to refocus our efforts on this very controversial and very technical bill. We have always

126
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:29,170
Worked tirelessly to support our bills committee to complete its scrutiny of the bill, and I hope that our colleagues get to do just that. Kenny, Kenny, you seem very hesitant to explain your previous position to.

127
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,160
係咯。

128
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,360
唔該曬，因為佢想展開十金之寶。

129
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:12,990
唔好意思，因為我而家十點九咧，我而家誒事實上有一個誒小組委員會會議要開，噉我希望我我講到我交代嘅嘢就講到呢度啦。啊，我我。

130
00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:12,640
If I may respond to your first question, we have in fact set out our thinking, our reasoning in in in detail in the circular that I issued to all members on Sunday just two days ago. In it, we have explained we have set

131
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:32,650
出的背景、 of the situation, what has transpire, and in the bills committee, and our reasoning behind doing what we have done. Yesterday, honourable Abraham Shack has already instructed the secretariat to issue.

132
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:52,660
Circular informing Bills Committee members that the meeting originally scheduled for yesterday has been rescheduled for this Saturday. Originally scheduled yesterday to be rescheduled for this Saturday. Beyond that, I have nothing to.
