1
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,970
現時。

2
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,000
and to provide for related matters.

3
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,110
for privately offered funds.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
子代續條例草案交由內務委員會處理。

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,030
我會講述有關《香港國安法》的審議過程。

6
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,660
係給分profits tax exemption under Chapter 112。

7
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:12,300
publicly offered funds，whether they are onshore or offshore funds。

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,080
The object of the bill is to amend the Inland Revenue Ordinance, Cap 112.

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,300
條例草案委員會主席梁繼昌議員先就委員會報告向本會發言。梁繼昌議員。

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,330
only offshore private offered funds and offshore private equity funds enjoy profits tax exemption.

11
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,760
本會恢復二零一八年税務豁免基金繳付利得税修訂條例草案嘅二讀辯論。

12
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:07,210
this tax disparity is not considered conducive to the further development of Hong Kong's asset and wealth management industry.

13
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:57,170
岸上私有化基金，with the exception of open-ended fund companies，do not enjoy profits tax exemption.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:56,980
to allow profits tax exemption for certain funds, whether or not the central management and control of the funds is exercised in Hong Kong.

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:35,370
Acting President, in my capacity as Chairman of the Bills Committee on Inland Revenue Proviso Tax Exemption for Funds Amendment Bill 2018.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:35,000
for the purpose of the bill, publicly offered fund refers to mutual fund, unit trust or similar investment scheme that is authorised as a collective investment scheme under section 104 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance.

17
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,230
the bills committee supports the bill and the objectives it seeks to achieve.

18
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,490
因為它會 disincentivise funds to dock missile or be managed in Hong Kong.

19
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,820
to further consolidate Hong Kong's competitive edge in the manufacturing and management of funds.

20
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:03,050
and to avoid being put on the European Union's list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.

21
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,460
成員們已討論過，是否一個基金會成為不資格申請税額豁免的基金。

22
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:41,220
我會 now highlight the major issues and concerns expressed by the Bills Committee in the course of its deliberation.

23
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,560
如果它投資在一家直接參與這些上市商業活動的公司。

24
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:34,880
The bill provides that a fund does not include a business undertaking that directly engages in certain commercial activities listed in the bill.

25
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:48,110
this may not meet the latest base erosion and profit shifting standard of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:26,620
and to adjust certain tax treatment for funds, so that Hong Kong remains competitive in the face of increasing regional and international competition.

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:25,750
Furthermore, the European Union has identified Hong Kong's tax regimes for offshore funds to be problematic on account of their ring fencing features.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:37,570
referring to the current situation that certain onshore privately offered funds cannot enjoy profits tax exemption that applies to their offshore counterparts.

29
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:24,160
一 fund， therefore， can be in the legal form of， for example， a partnership， a limited partnership， unit trust， an open-ended fund company， mutual fund corporation， or contractual arrangement。

30
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:15,830
The administration purposes proposes to introduce amendments to CAPTURE One One Two, to remove ring fencing tax features for fund entities under the existing tax regimes.

31
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:10,860
成員們已討論了基金的定義在法案中，並指出基金涵蓋了合同安排的概念，以及民事法管轄區的法律安排。

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:56,890
The bill seeks to add a new section to define fund, and provides for the conditions by which any arrangement that meets this new definition would be eligible for profits tax exemption.

33
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,460
如果它投資在一個私營公司。

34
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,530
which engages in those listed commercial activities.

35
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,040
even if a fund is taxed on its non-qualifying transactions.

36
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,700
In respect of the income derived from his investment activities.

37
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,150
一open ended fund company exempt from profits tax.

38
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,480
If at all times during the basis period for a year of assessment.

39
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,620
at present, under Section Twenty Eight H of Chapter One and Two.

40
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,320
and the fund may still qualify for profits tax exemption under the bill.

41
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,070
and would therefore unlikely to be able to qualify for tax exemption.

42
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,870
行政已經解釋過，一個商業或工業用途的企業。

43
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,090
The administration has clarified that it would be part of the normal operation of a fund.

44
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,460
It is a resident person and is non-closely held, as defined in Section Twenty A I.

45
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,630
The purpose of this non-closely held condition is to ensure that an open-ended fund company.

46
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:56,830
and carries out commercial or industrial transactions would unlikely to be able to satisfy the definition of fund under the bill.

47
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:36,440
成員有查詢，Whether a company which undertakes both commercial and investment activities would claim profits tax exemption.

48
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:21,920
the bills committee notes that there will be no tainting effect in the bill, so that the tax exempt profits of the fund will not be tainted.

49
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,940
enjoying tax exemption.

50
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,120
will be replaced by clause five of the bill.

51
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,270
and they have queried how the situations.

52
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,910
and to prevent an individual or corporate investor.

53
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,620
是 not owned by a handful of individuals or corporate investors only.

54
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,990
however， members are aware that sections 28H and 28I。

55
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,640
as those were the other funds, so that there would be a level playing field for funds operating in Hong Kong.

56
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:51,270
abuse the tax exemption by repackaging as business as an open-ended fund company.

57
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:53,350
或 be a qualified investment fund， in order to be eligible for profits tax exemption under the bill.

58
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:37,990
作為開放ended fund companies， are already subject to stringent regulation of the Securities and Futures Commission.

59
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:14,640
That the two sections seek to prevent would be handled if the non-closely fund condition is not reinstated elsewhere in the bill.

60
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:48,140
行政機構認為，他們應該繼續享受股息税豁免，於更廣泛的交易範疇。

61
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:26,350
行政已經解釋過，開設基金公司的條件，要符合税收優惠，基本上應該是相同的。

62
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:45,610
All funds, including open-ended fund companies, are required to engage a specified person to arrange or carry out its transactions in Hong Kong.

63
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:27,970
The administration has informed the Bills Committee that open-ended fund companies are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission, and at least ninety per cent of their investments are required to be securities or related products.

64
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:10,870
Members also note that, unlike other funds, an open-ended fund company is eligible for profits tax exemption, whether or not the assets in transactions are specified in the proposed Schedule 16C of the bill.

65
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,020
will still be taxable.

66
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,990
The profits arising therefrom.

67
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,490
行政維持，那，它會是困難。

68
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,180
或持有such assets that are utilised to generate income.

69
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,100
行政已經解釋過，作為一個原則。

70
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,770
as the operations of each open-ended company differ.

71
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,810
and appears not appropriate to specify such circumstances in the bill.

72
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,800
in such class of assets, or utilises such assets to generate income.

73
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,910
如果它 engages in direct trading or direct business undertaking in Hong Kong,

74
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,730
議會委員會已討論過如何發展反避税措施，以及它們在實務中的運作。

75
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,340
成員 have discussed whether the bill should specify the circumstances under which an open-ended fund company.

76
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:49,640
The profits of a fund arising from direct trading or direct business undertaking should be chargeable to profits tax.

77
00:09:50,150 --> 00:10:00,410
而一間開放型基金公司，可能享有profits tax exemption on transactions in assets of a non-schedule sixteen C class under the bill.

78
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:35,720
會被視為進行直接貿易或直接業務承諾在香港的資產，以非排定16C類別，或持有該等資產以獲取收入。

79
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:49,840
The administration indicates that, after the bill is passed, the Internal Revenue Department will issue a departmental interpretation and practice note, which will cover the interpretation and practice relating to the bill as a whole.

80
00:08:49,720 --> 00:09:09,730
The bill provides that an open-ended fund company would not be entitled to profits tax exemption if it carries on direct trading or direct business undertaking in Hong Kong in assets of a class that is not specified in the proposed Schedule sixteen C of the bill.

81
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,330
In particular.

82
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,920
Over the private company's assets.

83
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,290
The objectives of these measures.

84
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,870
As the price of immovable property fluctuates over time.

85
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,630
If the latter's immovable property exceeds ten percent of its assets.

86
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,330
under the bill, a fund would be taxed on its profits arising from investment in private company.

87
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:54,090
the bills committee supports the resumption of the second reading debate on the bill at the council meeting today.

88
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,220
are to discourage funds from investing excessively in the local immovable property market.

89
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,860
成員們有查詢，如何基金的資格，對於税額豁免可能受到影響。

90
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:50,580
The eligibility would be assessed according to the proportion of the immovable property's value.

91
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,930
to encourage funds to focus on the long-term prospects of the invested private companies.

92
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:02,300
行政已經也解釋過，這些採用的各種測試並非新嘅。

93
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:08,590
成員們已考慮過一宗情況，即係一基金投資於一間私營公司，該公司持有某啲資產係不動產。

94
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:42,560
The administration has explained that a snapshot of the private company's assets would be taken when the fund makes a transaction in that private company.

95
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:46,020
and to reduce the risk of tax abuse by engaging in trading activities through sales of shares in private companies.

96
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:18,280
They are either modelled on the existing profits tax exemption regime for open-ended fund companies, or are developed have regard to the information gathered from the private equity fund sector in the earlier consultation exercises.

97
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,530
alot of practitioners.

98
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
The main pusher of this.

99
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
或the purpose they serve.

100
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,580
now，more than ten years have now passed。

101
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,870
You know, proposed bill is mainly coming from EU.

102
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,560
quite beneficial regarding this bill.

103
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,090
But in in in fact, I think there are four things which are.

104
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,940
The only reason I can see, apart from the lobbying effort of the funds industry as a whole,

105
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,760
No amendment to the bill will be proposed by the Bills Committee.

106
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,490
And now，ridiculously，I，think，very，unfortunately，why，did，the，government，do，this，in，such，a，short，time？

107
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:07,670
Edwin，Chairman，here is my own view on the Inland Revenue Profits Tax Exemption for Funds Amendment Bill 2018.

108
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:16,530
now this is in fact a very landmark legislation which would be welcomed by the funds industry in Hong Kong in general.

109
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:48,730
工業 players have been lobbying the government to relax this regime in order that you know to increase the fund activities in Hong Kong and to benefit the fund management industry as a whole.

110
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:34,760
now first of all, I think we should note that the definition fund has been expanded to capture different kinds of bona fide funds and operations, regardless of their structure, size.

111
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:33,520
In fact, since the profits tax exemption regime for offshore funds, meaning those funds, qualified funds with the central management and controlled outside Hong Kong, were given the exemption from profits tax.

112
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:57,180
A fund in the context of this bill, acting president, can be in the legal form of unit trust partnership, limited partnership, open ended fund company, mutual fund corporation, or even contractual arrangement, which is very common in civil law jurisdiction.

113
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,450
啊！

114
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,280
and if.

115
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,170
馬修斯。

116
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,800
to avoid.

117
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,580
In fact, when

118
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,310
Bill has done is to expand the definition.

119
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,150
invest in immovable property.

120
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Of course， there is also other anti-avoidance。

121
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,830
It is very likely that it fails to qualify as a fund.

122
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,860
那 entity，那 particular legal entity is carrying such a trade or business.

123
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,840
The other second significance of this bill is that.

124
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,060
and of course these private companies, they are allowed to carry on trade or business.

125
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:35,430
Of course, in order to qualify as a fund, a fund of course undertakes investment. The fund cannot be carrying on a trade or business.

126
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:03,900
它 allows the fund to invest in private companies, both private companies outside Hong Kong and private companies established inside Hong Kong.

127
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:34,370
speculation excessive speculation in real estate in immovable property situated in Hong Kong, so there is a minimum a maximum threshold of 10% the valuation of the company taken together, if they have

128
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:21,000
The administration is drafting was drafting this bill. It definitely has taken into consideration the definition of a collective investment scheme, which is defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance in Part One, Schedule One of that piece of legislation. Now, this is one thing which the

129
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,840
ineligible assets。

130
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,760
Now, I would urge.

131
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,700
It has just allowed.

132
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,430
and a final.

133
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,530
嗯，The tinting effect。

134
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,000
significance of this bill is that.

135
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,810
在過去，如果基金投資在某

136
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,550
那係第二、第三，real significance of this bill.

137
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,220
一個 ineligible fund is investing in a private company in Hong Kong.

138
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,160
can give some highlight and rationale of know what what this bill is all about.

139
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:36,430
now，however，this bill has compartmentalised the eligible part and the non-eligible part.

140
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:03,440
will get taxed. The other part of the fund will still, if other conditions are qualified, be able to get the profits tax exemption.

141
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:28,670
The whole fund will be tainted, and the profits tax previously given to this fund will be forfeited. The whole fund will not be eligible.

142
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:49,770
The value of those properties cannot, those immovable properties, I mean, cannot exceed a 10% threshold, and that is one of the criteria when.

143
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:20,850
My honourable colleagues, to support this bill, although it sounds very technical, it sounds very you know convoluted, the whole bill. But I hope my very brief explanation of what the bill does.

144
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:53,870
If a fund, for example, has invested in a private company and that private company holds immovable property which has exceeded the threshold, then only the profits deriving from those ineligible investment—that is, the private company.

145
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,070
Now.

146
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,950
羅。

147
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,150
As the number one.

148
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,700
asset management centre Asia。

149
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,330
and，as at today。

150
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,700
Between the years two, one, three, one, four.

151
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,210
will further enhance our.

152
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,820
唔 necess to say， the passage of this bill。

153
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,470
And will generate more business, and will generate more.

154
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,520
has risen by 62% in those five years.

155
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,340
The number of funds authorised by SFC.

156
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,650
In Hong Kong, and that is a very encouraging figure.

157
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,290
the funds just look at the funds authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission alone.

158
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:34,870
as we all know, Hong Kong is an important international financial centre. In fact, if you look at some figures,

159
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:51,660
to to years 2017, 2018, and within a time span of just five years.

160
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:12,980
We got 2,799 SFC authorised collective investment schemes.

161
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,900
Now, of course.

162
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,090
quality employment。

163
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,760
underestimate this effect.

164
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,300
investment into private companies.

165
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,140
Apart from securing funding.

166
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,090
of untapped， you know。

167
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,230
this bill also encourages.

168
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,450
但，more importantly， I must say.

169
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,640
and this is very important, and we should not.

170
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,890
from these venture funds, private equity funds, whatever you call them.

171
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,100
第三個 reason 為我哋應該支持呢個法案，和，喺事實。

172
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,830
funding from these funds will be a major source.

173
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:46,840
for people supporting the funds industry, the administrators, the bookrunners, the professionals.

174
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:21,980
from the stock exchange, maybe they're too too small, without track record, maybe they don't want to go public.

175
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:10,350
new startups, companies involving in fintech, high tech, whatever kind of technology they would like to do, they need money, they need funding.

176
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:46,890
income for these companies located in Hong Kong, these private companies can now locate in Hong Kong, can now do the R and D. They also benefit from the R and D no super deduction, and now they have the source of funding.

177
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,980
Now.

178
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,050
which meets.

179
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,180
In fact, I have.

180
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,130
國際上，有個叫

181
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,780
The business community and the

182
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,520
In Hong Kong, and I have to say this. I have to tell the business community.

183
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,390
立法會制度， in particular a tax legislative regime.

184
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,260
我有工作，非常 hard 去 secure 一個早 passage of 這 bill，是那。

185
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,810
differs the treatment between onshore and offshore operations.

186
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,040
And Hong Kong is not a tax haven. We have the most stringent, you know, regulation.

187
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:54,610
however，I think we should not be complacent because there are quite a few things which the government has failed to deliver.

188
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:21,140
regulators in EU is not quite happy that you know is not is not happy that our

189
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:22,310
The financial regulators in the EU have to tell the tax authorities in the EU, we have done it. We have done it properly, quickly, effectively and efficiently.

190
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:45,210
and if we are not going to change the law to give a level playing field between onshore and offshore operation in respect of the funds alone.

191
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:45,530
The international standard, and we are still moving forward, and we will retain the number one place in asset management as a, also in Asia and hopefully later a number one asset management centre of the world.

192
00:21:45,530 --> 00:22:05,540
There is a very high risk that EU may somehow one day trying to do something to Hong Kong and to enlist Hong Kong as a not very you know transparent or competitive tax regime and maybe putting us on a kind of watch list and this unwelcoming news if they do so.

193
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,200
喺幾分鐘後。

194
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,780
我 must， you know。

195
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,430
and of course the government has been telling.

196
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,050
We should be told what the economic effects are if there's.

197
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,630
所以， altogether， by the end of this day， I hope。

198
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,040
We have dealt with two tax legislations, and we're going to do another one.

199
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,720
但我們沒有見到太多具體的證據或數據。

200
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,480
We have given a lot of incentives to various sectors of business of the economy.

201
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,930
We are pushed through 12 pieces of legislation, which are all tax related.

202
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:13,230
and since the beginning of this year, 2019， is just two two two months。

203
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,840
to tell us what kind of economic benefits these legislations have brought us.

204
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:05,870
make a small statistics in the past one year during 2018 there are nine tax related bills which have been passed nine.

205
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:28,650
to report to the financial affairs panel on a regular basis of the performance of these various financial sectors once these bills have passed, or else.

206
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:40,590
tell you the truth that many of these bills, if not all, could be wasted. Your effort would be wasted. The effort of all our colleagues in vetting the bills would be wasted.

207
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:18,360
ask that yes it would it would be beneficial to the economy it would be beneficial to employment but no such figures were ever given to us and then I would urge the government.

208
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:05,760
We need to be told what are the economic benefits. We want to see some statistics. We want to see, for example, like the employment figure. For example, like you know how many funds have established things like that.

209
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,050
no economic effects。

210
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,510
and secondly, I think.

211
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,610
and research.

212
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,660
on how you know carry interest.

213
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,080
should come down to a very serious study.

214
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,420
Okay，back to the private equity business。

215
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,500
must be finalised and.

216
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,440
formalised as a legislation, and we need that urgently.

217
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,920
company used by a lot of you know Americans.

218
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,770
The Limited Partnership Law, as a collective investment structure.

219
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,920
this could be due to two reasons. One, you are not promoting.

220
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,510
The bureau and the inland revenue department has as a whole.

221
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,850
you know the incentive enough or two the incentive given is too little too late then you must change the law.

222
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:16,020
Are we doing good? Are we doing okay? After this bill, I don't think so. There are a few more things that you should consider pushing forward quickly. One.

223
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:43,370
I mean the limited partnership for collective investment purposes, and not the limited partnership for professional firms. So, as a very popular investment vehicle.

224
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:30,970
I think on many occasions, many of my colleagues, including my colleague Dennis Kwok, has been telling the government that you have to push through the legislation for the establishment of limited partnership in Hong Kong.

225
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,520
蔡主席。

226
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,690
should be taxed.

227
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,430
I think.

228
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,660
although we got so many other advantages.

229
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,750
有有冇其他議員想發言？

230
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,860
would not choose Hong Kong, would avoid Hong Kong in the long run.

231
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,660
can galvanise the support of the whole house. Thank you.

232
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,680
你 have to devise a clear cut way.

233
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,770
要deal with carried interest，你cannot just hide yourself under the sand。

234
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:12,510
Thanking Chairman, President, that is my speech on the bill, and I hope this bill.

235
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,230
如果冇，我請局長答辯，之後辯論即告結束。財經事務及庫務局局長。

236
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:46,280
and treat, you know, you know these, you know, accrued carried interest on a case by case basis.

237
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,270
which is a very common, you know, incentive arrangement for private equity funds.

238
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:05,090
我哋建議嘅税務措施嘅支持，以及喺過程裏邊提及提出一啲有意意誒有非常有用嘅意見。

239
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:56,810
because if we do not have a consistent and clear policy, let alone a piece of legislation, many of these private equity funds

240
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:56,810
我感謝法案委員會主席梁繼昌議員同埋其他委員，以及立法會秘書處同埋法律顧問嘅努力，令到二零一八年税務豁免基金繳付利得税修訂條例草案呢個審議工作係得以順利完成。我亦都感謝業界對我。

241
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,810
於迴避税嘅條文，以防止漏税。

242
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,500
誒包括第一相關實體係需要符合基金嘅定義。

243
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:32,900
實外基金嚟到香港註冊同埋喺香港管理，係不利香港資產同埋財富管理業嘅進一步發展。

244
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:11,550
特定目的實體嘅層面嘅税項豁免，將係會按基金持有嘅呢一個實體嘅權益百分率而定。

245
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:44,790
另外一方面，即係可以為喺在香港營辦嘅在岸基金同埋離岸基金，係製造公平嘅競爭環境。

246
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:35,560
要剔除歐盟對香港適用於以私人形式發售離岸基金呢個税務安排存在分隔措施嘅疑慮。

247
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:02,860
合資格交易而係受到影響，我哋亦都建議，如果基金透過成立特定目的實體持有同埋管理佢哋喺私人公司所作嘅投資。

248
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:10,800
第二基金嘅交易係需要由獲證監會發牌嘅發團喺香港安排或者進行，或者基金係屬於符合資格嘅基金。

249
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:25,400
第二條例草案針對以私人形式發售嘅基金，只要佢哋喺香港營辦並且符合若干條件，無論佢哋係喺在岸或者係離岸，以及佢嘅結構、規模或者目的，都係可以享有利得税豁免。呢一方面係。

250
00:28:45,070 --> 00:29:05,080
根據現行嘅税制，喺以私人形式發售嘅基金中間，只有離岸基金同埋在岸開放式基金型嘅公司係享有利得税豁免，其他在岸基金不能夠同樣噉樣享有利得税嘅豁免。喺基金投資層面方面，

251
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:25,090
税務條例目前定明，以私人形式發售嘅離岸基金，如果要享有呢個税項豁免，佢哋可以投資喺在海外成立嘅私人公司，但係佢哋不可以投資喺本地嘅私人公司。上述嘅不同嘅税務待遇，或者會。

252
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:53,590
就此，我哋制定咗條例草案喺税務條例中間加入咗獨立成章嘅修訂條文，畀所有喺香港營辦嘅在岸基金同埋離岸基金，只要符合若干條件，都可以享有同樣嘅利得税豁免嘅安排。需要符合嘅條件。

253
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,120
會唔會現在？

254
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,260
反對嘅請舉手。

255
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,910
二零一八年税務豁免基金繳付利得税修訂條例草案。

256
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,790
我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

257
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:50,910
我現在向各位提出嘅代決議題係二零一八年税務豁免基金繳付利得税修訂條例草案，予以議讀。贊成嘅請舉手。

258
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:39,550
條例草案已經得到法案委員會嘅支持，我懇請本會預議通過，畀呢個税務擴面安排可以喺今年四月開始實施。代主席，我緊止陳詞。

259
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:27,290
由於境外基金投資喺本地私人公司嘅税務安排，亦都已經移除，本地初創企業亦都應該會因為有機會成為基金嘅投資對象而受惠。

260
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:31,090
而符合資格嘅基金係需要有最少五名嘅投資者，並且需要符合關於資本認繳總額同埋發放淨收益嘅相關要求。以及第三，基於投資喺指明資產嘅利潤可以獲得利得税豁免，呢一啲啊包括基金通常。

261
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:51,100
常會投資嘅證券同埋其他類別嘅金融產品。此外，基金投資喺本地同埋海外私人嘅公司都可以享有離得税豁免。此外，我哋建議基金可以享税項豁免嘅利潤，唔會因為其他嘅需要繳税嘅非合。

262
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:31,930
為咗減低避税嘅風險，我哋亦都會引入咗防止濫用嘅措施，包括對基金喺私人公司嘅投資嘅不動產持有期同埋短期資產作出一啲規限或者要求。此外，我哋亦都喺條例草案裏邊保留咗基金嘅防止於。

263
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:55,250
法案委員會曾經就基金嘅含義、防止濫用嘅措施呢啲實際操作、開放式基金型公司日後嘅税務安排、特定目的實體嘅税務安排等技術嘅細節係進行咗討論。我哋已經就各項嘅事宜向委員會作出詳細嘅解釋，委員會。

264
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:15,260
佢並冇進一步嘅問題。代主席，我哋認為條例草案將會有助加強香港喺製造同埋管理基金方面嘅競爭優勢，亦都可以帶動其他相關專業服務嘅需求，促進香港整體金融服務業進一步嘅發展。此外，
