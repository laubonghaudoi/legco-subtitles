1
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,890
時間。

2
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,110
噉啊！

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,110
大家冇問題，OK。

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
啦，咁可以開會啦。

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,050
就唔係舉手發問。

6
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,860
係啊，毛岸者議員，對吧？

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,920
喺列咗喺個議程嗰度嘅。

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,660
誒就喺待議事項一覽表嘅第一行。

9
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,690
噉啊！大家如果陣間有問問題咧，要禁制啊，所以誒。

10
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:13,280
OK，如果冇意見咧，噉我哋就去議程第三，就係競爭事務委員會嘅工作報告。

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,520
誒競爭事務委員會公約部，我哋而家可以請佢哋入嚟啦，好吧？我係請競委會一啲誒同事入嚟。

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:05,110
誒，第二個議程咧就係空運危險品嘅法例修訂建議，就喺待議事項嘅第二項。噉啊，大家委員有冇意見？

13
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:23,030
O.K.咁上次會議於二零一九年三月廿五號，誒秘書處共發咗五份資料文件畀大家。誒文件就係。

14
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:42,130
咁今次就係將會係經委會就係簡介佢哋工作報告啦，就會係由佢哋嘅行政總裁簡介個問題。噉啊，大家可以而家禁制排隊快問啦。

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:49,910
咁下次會議討論嘅事項咧，噉啊，下次嘅會議將會係二零一九年五月廿七號星期一上午十點正五分舉行，就將會政府而家建議咧，就討論兩個項目，第一個項目咧就提升香港船泊註冊處嘅服務。

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:18,330
我想問問一問嗰排序啫嘛，趁佢哋。哦，OK，嗱，暫時有七位嘅委員排撳咗掣。哦，第一位揾邵謙議員，跟住姚思榮議員，跟住譚志明議員、毛孟靜議員、陳振英議員同周浩鼎議員，同埋梁繼昌議員，暫時七位。

17
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,820
with alleged cartel conduct comprising the bulk.

18
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,570
Both of us will report on different aspects of the commission's work.

19
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,920
around 60% of the complaints and queries relate to the first conduct rule.

20
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,570
The number and depth of complaints and inquiries received during the year continue to grow steadily.

21
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,850
冼博倫先生，行政總裁，誒報告一下競委會而家現時嘅情況，誒。

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,790
暫時充足四分鐘先，好冇？噉我哋而家請競委會誒。

23
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:06,530
在委員會第三個完整年份的運作中，我們繼續執行執法行動，這些行動主要由投訴驅動。

24
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:58,330
the rest are either second conduct rule matters or general enquiries relating to competition matters or the ordinance.

25
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:31,830
We also have a representative of the government, Ms. Leona Law, the Principal Assistant Secretary of CEDB, who is joining us as well.

26
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:41,160
佢有三位三位誒同事嚟，第一位就係誒冼博倫先生行政總裁，第二位就係畢仲明。

27
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:57,450
While I focus on the Commission's enforcement work, Mr. Butt will report on our policy advisory and advocacy initiatives during the year.

28
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:18,910
queries, whistleblowers, leniency applications, referrals, and other information we obtain to identify potential contraventions of the ordinance.

29
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:54,120
先生就係高級行政總監，第三位就係羅家榮女士，就係誒我哋商經局嘅首席助理秘書長。噉我哋而家先請啊～

30
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:39,660
as of the end of March 2019, the commission has received and processed over 3,500 complaints and inquiries since full operations began in December 2015.

31
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:46,670
By and large, we are pleased to report that the Commission has made good progress across its various aspects of work over the past year, and we are excited about the trajectory that we are on.

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:17,880
Brian, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and panel members. We appreciate the opportunity to report on the work of the Competition Commission over the past year. I have with me Mr. Rasul Butt, who is our senior executive director.

33
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,950
That interpret the ordinance.

34
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,970
Let me take a moment to talk about applications for decision.

35
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,830
and provide guidance to the commission's enforcement, as well as to the business and legal communities.

36
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,790
這些 cases are also significant because they will establish additional judicial precedents.

37
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,640
and other conduct that we have reasonable cause to suspect has the object or effect of harming competition in Hong Kong.

38
00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:00,790
The commission is able to build on its growing experience to take on more complex investigations involving both serious anti-competitive conduct.

39
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:08,210
Around 200 of these complaints were assessed further, of which 15% have proceeded to full in-depth investigation.

40
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:40,920
我們也確認， at the same time， that the Commission has no current intention to take further action in respect of the present version of the code.

41
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:19,980
The commission has also referred 130 complaints and queries in relation to the telecom and broadcasting sector to the communications authority.

42
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:19,560
在過程，leading to the trials，the tribunal has made a number of important procedural rulings in the commission's favour in these cases，which will guide our enforcement work going forward.

43
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:07,590
The trials of the commission's first two cartel cases filed in 2017 have been completed, and it's expected that judgments will be handed down by the competition tribunal in 2019.

44
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:54,190
It was the first time the commission brought direct enforcement action against relevant individuals, driving home the deterrent message that both companies and individuals engaged in cartels may expect to face the full force of the law.

45
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:31,370
In response to an application from the banking sector, the Commission published a decision last October, finding that the Code of Banking Practice is not excluded from the first conduct rule by the legal requirements exclusion in the competition ordinance.

46
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:38,200
在September two thousand and eighteen， the Commission commenced proceedings in the Competition Tribunal against three renovation companies and two individuals for alleged market sharing and price coordination in the provision of renovation services in a housing estate.

47
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:51,580
在 addition to the cases mentioned above, we are pursuing an increasingly diverse range of investigations encompassing both the first conduct rule and the second conduct rule, which may result in various enforcement outcomes, including some we anticipate later this year.

48
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:59,360
In January this year, the Commission received an application for a decision from the Hong Kong Association of Pharmaceutical Industries. Excuse me, please. How how long shall report? Probably another two minutes for me, and then about five.

49
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,960
yeah。

50
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,730
and.

51
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,360
嗯，因為。

52
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,640
minutes for Mr. Butt.

53
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,400
we we only have forty five minutes.

54
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:18,200
Left for the sections, so maybe you can have a brief report rather than have to.

55
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,230
Apart from bringing cases to the tribunal for litigation, the commission will start making use of different remedies provided under the ordinance as appropriate.

56
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:56,390
benefit to competition and consumers in Hong Kong. As we've done in our third case, we plan to continue to pursue liability not only for culpable businesses but also relevant individuals to enhance the deterrent effect of the law and to encourage compliance.

57
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:38,700
Tell us everything. Okay, all right, thank you. Just to give you a sense of what to expect going forward, guided by our enforcement priorities, we'll continue to make use of our our enforcement power and prioritise those investigations and enforcement actions that result in the greatest overall benefit.

58
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:27,570
now， I think I will go ahead and pass to Mr. Butt to report on our policy advice and advocacy work in the past year. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Butt. 嗯，主席咁多位委員，噉我好快重點講講幾幾樣嘢啦。咁過去一年，我哋建委會都啊就住唔同嘅議題提供咗同。

59
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:47,580
競爭有關嘅意見，同埋我哋亦都做咗好多教育倡導方面嘅工作嘅。咁喺投提供意見方面，我哋因應有資料同埋投訴顯示，有一啲企業佢哋採用嘅僱傭措施可能會引起競爭嘅問題。咁所以，我哋建委會喺二零一八年嘅四月，我哋發布。

60
00:09:47,580 --> 00:10:07,590
到咗一份嘅意見公告，係提醒僱主、僱員同埋人力資源界從業員，佢哋要注意同僱員措施相關嘅潛在競爭嘅風險嘅。我我哋亦都喺年內誒加強咗同政府部門啦、公營機構佢哋嘅聯係，誒為咗協助公營。

61
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,710
係啊，百香。

62
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:59,390
甚至我睇翻數據，你亦都有啲係控告咗啦。噉我問題有兩條啊，主席，一個就係誒誒，剛才啊啊啊總監都講咗啦，就做咗大量一啲嘅誒。

63
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:27,600
界別同埋政策制定者去識別同埋評估公共政策對競爭嘅影響。我哋喺去年嘅五月發布咗競爭條例嘅公營界別指南，隨後我哋亦都喺同年嘅九月舉辦咗一係列由國際競爭法專家主講嘅培訓。咁今年年初我哋亦都就突破性。

64
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:47,610
創新科技嘅競爭問題，為公營界別舉辦咗一場後續嘅培訓嘅。咁透過呢啲交流同接觸，我哋建委會同政府部門同埋公共機構就誒達成咗更緊密嘅協調，就不同嘅領域共大概有三十多項嘅政策議題提供咗意見嘅。

65
00:10:47,610 --> 00:11:07,620
噉我哋亦都好高興咁見到政府部門同埋公共機構喺年內亦都好頻密噉樣就唔同嘅競爭事宜諮詢我哋競委會嘅意見嘅。咁至於我哋教育倡倡導嘅工作，我哋為咗協助誒本地嘅傳媒加深對誒競爭條例同埋相關。

66
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:27,630
關嘅課題嘅認識咧，我哋誒都誒安排咗一個誒工作坊，幫助佢哋深入講解誒條例嘅內容同埋概念。咁有關嘅活動，我哋亦都得到傳媒嘅踴躍支持嘅。咁至於教育年輕嘅一代，亦都一向係我哋警委會嘅誒重要。

67
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:47,640
工作之一噉，所以除咗喺中學同埋大學，我哋行上升會舉辦一啲講座同工作坊之外咧，我哋亦都舉辦唔同嘅挑戰賽。咁誒，其中嘅挑戰賽，我哋將一個冠軍嘅作品做藍本，推出咗我哋首首個嘅微電影。咁呢個電影亦都喺。

68
00:11:47,640 --> 00:12:07,650
啊！網絡啊，唔同嘅平台嗰度播放，亦都受到誒廣大市民嘅接受嘅。咁喺我哋而家邁向條例全面實施嘅三週年，我哋誒去年十一月亦都舉辦咗首個國際會議。咁嗰個會議提供咗一個適時嘅平台，畀香港同其他嘅司。

69
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:27,660
誒司法管轄區吸取知識同埋經驗，亦都促進咗我哋跨界別同埋跨地區嘅合作。咁最後今年我哋其中一個重點嘅工作咧，我哋就會聚焦中小企嘅合規培訓嘅工作，加強佢哋守法嘅意識同埋能力。誒，我哋競爭條例係。

70
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:47,670
適用於唔同嘅界別、唔同嘅企業啊，無論你係大中小都好。噉，我哋建委會亦都理解到一啲中小企佢哋未必好似一啲大型又或者跨國嘅企業，佢哋有法律嘅資源同埋經驗去了解條條例嘅重點，又或者組織佢哋嘅合規培訓嘅。

71
00:12:47,670 --> 00:13:07,680
咁所以我哋建委會亦都繼續誒會計劃進一步接觸中小企啦，同埋我哋亦都會為一啲誒冇誒佢哋可能冇競爭法經驗嘅律師行，我哋亦都會為佢哋培誒提供一啲培訓，誒幫助佢哋誒提供一啲合規培訓嘅誒增。

72
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:27,690
加強佢哋合合規培訓嘅能力嘅咁有關工具同埋培訓，我哋將會喺今年內推出。咁以上就係我誒我同我行政總裁啊，就住我哋執法啊，提供政策意見同埋教育倡導工作嘅簡介。咁如果議員有任何嘅提問，我哋好樂意去解答嘅。多謝主席。

73
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:47,750
因為有成十位議員誒撳咗撳咗掣嘅，噉啊，暫時四分鐘先。第一位揾徐經議員，誒多謝主席。誒首先就好多謝警警委會喺過去誒嘅工作啦。咁好似剛才行政總裁同埋文件所講啦，都我哋知道都係接咗大量嘅投訴，有幾千宗。噉就有啲都係誒進行一調查。

74
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:19,680
教育對外工作，包對中小企啦，對誒公眾啦。但我發現咧有情況嘅，其實唔少公共機構或者大企業都中招嘅。噉就包括誒房委會屬下嘅一啲投訴都唔少啦，有一啲仲甚至誒去到法庭添嚇。咁亦都有誒一啲工程係涉嫌違標。

75
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:39,690
啲話有啲問題會出現咗咁誒誒，我知道你哋唔會評論個別個案啦，係咪有啲仲進行緊啦？噉我想問啊，有一啲比較誒社會上關注嘅嘅團體或機構，包括譬如房屋署或者誒公共屋邨或者誒居屋嘅法團，甚至附近日鬧得比較多嘅就係一啲誒公營街市啊、領展。

76
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:59,700
點見話誒有有一個比較惡嘅點點，佢名佛山信聯噉樣，即係佢哋係唔聽嘅。噉我我想問你哋嗰啲嘅誒工作、教工作或者建議提醒，會唔會都同呢啲機構會有一個度身訂造、主動同佢傾咧？會唔會甚至乎有啲主動嘅延伸措施畀佢？佢係咪有啲嘢成？

77
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:19,710
譬如個程程序上出現問題咧，我第二個問題都係簡單嘅，主席就係我知我我留意到咧，阿阿誒呢個競委會主席阿胡鴻玉咧，早前提到關於誒航空公司合併啊，即係國泰同埋香港快運嗰度，噉就而家條例就就住嗰合併守則上面咧，唔好唔好講漏洞啊，起碼唔給。

78
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:39,720
罰到先嚟㗎，係咪咁誒？呢一度誒，經委會或者我想問下官方，即係秘書長會唔會答一答？會唔會有主動嘅一個修例堵塞在，免得咧而家嗰個誒合併手續淨係監管電信業咯。噉就其他行業啲大嘅企業合併嘅時候就完全誒唔受到監管。區主席，好啊，邊位回應啊？行政主座定係？

79
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:50,880
us to go back and gather more evidence from the complainant, to do research of public sources to see what we can begin to understand about the complaint and the conduct under investigation.

80
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:57,780
社噉佢哋如果定立一個最少譬如半個月或者一個月時間通知，噉佢哋有一個噉嘅共同一個噉嘅協議或者默契噉嘅情況之下，會唔會涉及一個所謂違反競爭條例嘅問題咧？嚇，兩個問題先嚇。好啊，係咪不生定啊？

81
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:39,240
我哋建委會係好樂意提供一啲意見，係喺依個程序裏邊，會唔會有啲咩方面可以兼顧下競爭呢一方面咧？好啊，咁依一個我哋係跟進緊。下一位啊，姚思榮議員。誒，多謝主席。就誒有關競爭法呢個問題咧，咁誒。

82
00:15:41,000 --> 00:16:01,010
誒主席，不如由我解答依兩個問題啦。咁第一個問題就係誒關於啲公營機構嘅咁誒，我諗議員都會知道啦。咁公營機構其實係喺誒競爭法之下係豁免嘅。咁但係雖然係噉樣誒，當年誒立法會立例嗰陣時候，亦都有講過。

83
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:21,020
雖然捐營機構啊、政府部門佢哋係豁免呢條法例，但係佢哋亦都要跟循我哋《健身法》個精神嘅。噉，所以我哋喺誒，我哋誒，健委會除咗係執法方面咧，我哋亦都有一個誒提供一啲政策意見嘅職能嘅。咁依一個我哋亦都誒好。

84
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:41,030
好誒緊密去做噉，我哋亦都會同唔同嘅政府部門啊、公營機構，我哋有聯係。譬如你有提到嘅誒誒房屋處啊，噉樣嗰啲，我哋都房委會啊，我哋都有做嘅。咁同埋我哋而家越嚟越誒發覺咧，就係越嚟越多嘅政府部門同埋公營機。

85
00:16:41,030 --> 00:17:01,040
佢哋喺制定佢哋嗰啲新嘅政策嘅時候咧，其實佢哋已經會揾我哋競委會畀意見，睇下我哋從競爭嘅角度睇會唔會有啲咩問題。噉我哋已經誒盡早畀咗意見佢哋。咁當佢哋可幫助佢哋推出呢個政策之時咧，已經兼顧咗誒。

86
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:21,050
競爭呢一環誒環節㗎啦，咁所以其實我哋係見到逐漸逐漸係進步緊嘅。咁另外一條物議員另外一條問題就係關於國泰收購誒呢一件事嘅。咁誒據我哋所知，其實呢一個收購暫時都係誒未曾安落定嘅。咁誒頭先。

87
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:41,060
議員都提到啊，係誒好正確嘅，就係我哋競爭法之下係有一個合併守則，但係我哋而家合併守則咧係唔適用於除咗電信業係唔適用於第二個界別嘅。咁雖然係噉，我哋亦都誒，雖然合併守則係誒而家唔適用啦。

88
00:17:41,060 --> 00:18:01,070
噉，但係我哋建委會對任何誒市場誒發生嘅事，如果係對競爭有影響，我哋都好關注嘅。噉，所以我哋亦都主動去誒接觸有關嘅政府部門。我哋希望佢哋，如果誒，譬如依一個合併係誒，依個誒誒。

89
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:21,080
合併會進行嘅，我哋會希望誒有關部門會睇下，會唔會依個合合併啊？又或者依個收購係係要需要係滿足某啲法例啊，又或者有啲牌照嘅要求，佢哋係要誒遵守嘅。咁如果係有依啲情況出現，我哋咧。

90
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:59,610
我我哋係誒知道咧，而家社會上咧就有好多投訴啦。咁但係誒都你哋都有二百宗係處處理緊嘅喺當中，你哋會唔會有一個誒篩選或者評估嘅機制，去誒使到有啲比較多人關注嗰啲項目，你哋會優先處理？

91
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,190
即係嚟緊，競委會仲有啲乜嘢可以做，或者官方仲有啲咩可以做？

92
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,400
九呢個四月廿八號嘅新聞嚟嘅，啊隔離嗰間又噉嘅價錢，再隔離嗰間又係噉嘅價錢。

93
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:44,590
事實上，證委會成立嗰陣時咧，對於即係調查油公司，我哋有啲期望嘅，但係而家似乎出咗嚟。

94
00:21:51,300 --> 00:22:04,930
the Hong Kong Seaport Alliance, we believe that it raises such issues of importance for the local community that we are prioritising that investigation over some that may have pre-existed it in the Commission.

95
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:19,620
還是你係唔係嘅？就優先秩序就係按照你早嚟，我啊早處理，遲嚟遲處理咧噉樣。咁第二個問題就有關誒一啲對競爭法條例嘅理解問題。誒，我假設譬如誒有啲航空公司嘅協會，噉佢哋有一一大部分航空公司係入。

96
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:39,630
組會嘅噉係為咗即係使到誒旅行社或者消費者能夠清晰誒嗰個佢哋有關嘅要求，譬如佢哋對燃油附加費啦，或者税項嘅要求，佢哋要要加價啦。咁誒佢哋係誒要提早一個時時間去通知啲消費者或者。

97
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:18,440
Okay, I will go ahead and address those questions. With respect to the first question in whether we have a sequence or a process that we follow in handling complaints, the answer is generally yes. Complaints as they come in are reviewed and processed.

98
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:38,450
Many require no further action, especially those that are simply queries. Those that are deemed to raise potential issues of contraventions of the competition law are usually then escalated or elevated for an what's called an initial assessment, which requires.

99
00:20:51,270 --> 00:21:11,280
And during the course of that initial assessment process, if we obtain information or evidence that suggests or gives us a reasonable cause to suspect that a contravention has occurred, we can then elevate that once again to a formal investigation, which allows us to use our make use of our.

100
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:31,290
formal investigative powers, such as our ability to execute search warrants or compel the production of documents or information, while it is very often the case that complaints that come in earlier are processed more quickly. We don't have a hard and fast rule along that.

101
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:51,300
and in fact, certain investigations that raise particularly important public issues can be prioritised. We announced last January that we have an investigation of the Hong Kong Seaport Alliance, for instance, and despite the fact that we have complaints and investigations that may have predated.

102
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:25,480
With respect to airline associations, I think you can say that airline associations really are not really any different from a competition standpoint than other types of trade associations and other market sectors, and certainly there can be issues.

103
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:45,490
That arise in the context of trade associations that certainly do raise competitive concerns and could give us a reasonable cause to suspect that a contravention has occurred. In which case, then we would conduct an investigation. But it really depends on the facts of a particular case and the issues that are raised.

104
00:22:45,490 --> 00:23:05,500
thank you。誒，跟住葉志明議員，唔該主席。誒，主席啊，我唔明點解今日冇官員出席啊？因為有啲我哋唔滿意嘅嘢咧，都冇人跟進嘅喎。有有有有商經局哦，又喺度啊，唔好意思啊，阿羅女士睇漏咗嗱。誒，文件裏邊嘅第十二同第十三段裏邊咧，有提到。

105
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:25,510
境委會之前做過一啲研究啦，當然我都有誒誒出個聲嘅，關於本地汽車嗰個燃油市場嗰個調查。咁誒話誒委員會咧係出咗一個嘅調查研究報告啦，咁亦都有啲建議嘅。咁誒記錄裏邊都講咗啦嚇，而係委員咧對於環境局對該等建議嘅回應係表示失望嘅。

106
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:45,520
嚇，即係乜都唔做嗱，咁咧就誒，我想喺度引誒引述一下咧，四月二十八號嘅嗰個一個新聞報導，就講香港燃油價格嗰個嘅高企，咁裏邊提到咧就訪問一啲市民啦，噉佢就話啊呢間油價今時今日咧大概十七個四毫。

107
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,560
誒。

108
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,010
北京， coffers。

109
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,570
bidding and auction.

110
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,900
just insidiously by.

111
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,580
being, what they they have come under.

112
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:58,150
money from red China. What do you have to say to that? Thank you.

113
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:51,280
so that we would have more competition in this particular trade. Now, talking of which.

114
00:27:51,560 --> 00:28:00,850
bidding an auction. I've heard so many complaints from businessmen in Hong Kong that they are

115
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:09,660
Right, I will. Oh, not to mention, not to mention the political clout that comes with the red money investments.

116
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:59,290
下去儘量誒睇誒照顧曬唔同方面嘅因素，但係有時真係有一個誒取捨或者唔同因素之間，大家誒有唔同嘅誒，我哋有唔同嘅考慮咯。冇分別，議員。

117
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:25,060
unfair competition because Hong Kong, the Hong Kong market is now inundated with red capital from China, mainland China. Some of it allegedly has actually the backing of the huge

118
00:23:50,680 --> 00:24:10,690
噉佢就話咧，其實今個月就加三次㗎啦。但係減油價永遠都係一兩個月先減一次，油價咧就不停咁加。噉佢咧都好深水呢個新聞報道又講咧誒，而家燃油嗰個零售價咧差唔多係紀錄以來最高嘅，但係國際油價就唔係二零零八年七月原油價格一百四十七蚊每。

119
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:30,700
幾金一桶，當時咧賣十六個八毫一，一公升。今日咧跌到內五六十三蚊一桶，反圍咧嗰個零售價格仲貴咗百分之六。嗱，我就對於燃油嗰個嘅監控咧，個市場監控咧係表達非常之大嘅關注嘅。不過咧，由於呢個責任跌咗環境局，我就唔感覺到環境局咧覺。

120
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:50,710
得監管個價格咧係佢嘅職責啊，所以我唔知政府邊個部門應該跟進呢樣嘢。另外一樣嘢我亦都成日提嘅就係嗰個柴油，柴油係免税嘅，而柴油照我所理解咧，由新加坡嚟香港嗰個入口價咧仲平過稀油啊，但係咧佢買個價格咧都十幾蚊嘅喎，但係中間冇税。

121
00:24:50,710 --> 00:25:10,720
嘅，我哋點解容許啲油商可以賺取一個咁高嘅利潤嘅咧？咁咁當然佢好多理由嘅，又呢樣貴嗰樣貴。咁牽涉另外一個問題啊，就因為個地價，而家咧講緊幾億去投一個油站嗰個地價，我哋已經畀緊六個零六嘅汽油税，仲要畀雙重税項，就因為政。

122
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:30,730
政府高地價政策噉，我唔係話地係冇價值，但係係咪可以有一個？即係當時我都建議咗啊嚇，亦都同阿阿阿畢生傾過嘅啊。你哋都其實係好含蓄地咧喺你報告提出，就話其實係有一個機會咧，係作一個嘅變動嘅。不過可惜，我哋政府咧冇人願意跟進呢樣嘢啊。噉我唔知。

123
00:25:44,870 --> 00:26:04,880
就唔係嗰樣嘢，同埋諸乎嘢係做唔到啲乜嘢？噉我睇下邊位回應係咪誒？阿羅小姐，你可以回應下。係唔該，主席。誒，其實政府喺制定或者檢討一個政策崗子咧，誒，要評估同埋考慮多方面嘅因素啦。咁當然其中一個因素就係。

124
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:24,890
對經濟嘅影響，亦都包括對競爭嘅影響嘅。噉我都好理解。誒，競委會之前出咗一個誒市場研究報告，咁亦都誒有同環境局誒交換個意見。而交誒環境局其實係考慮過唔同嘅因素之後咧，都覺得有部分意見佢係可以誒。

125
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:44,900
實施得到噉佢會做啦，但係有部分佢都覺得現階段佢又唔唔係睇到好大嘅利，佢覺得應該做嘅。咁誒，我理解佢之前都喺誒環境事務委員會度都交代過，咁所以我都唔代佢哋重複啦。咁但係誒個原則其實係即係政府應該喺可以嘅情況之下。

126
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:19,580
嗯，Good, Isaac. Now I surely appreciate the work of the Commission, especially when you would dare to attack the government's very obvious protection of the Hong Kong taxi trade, the existing.

127
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:39,590
stakeholders, stakeholders and those with vested interests are quite so obviously being protected by this government, and the fact that you would actually call on the authorities to please allow.

128
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,800
blessing。

129
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:35,220
所以，Whether or not the auction's a secret or open, they have the clout.

130
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:15,220
what you were saying just now, if you find any reasonable causes to look into.

131
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:25,260
You can't basically, right? They're simply armed with political backing and.

132
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:06,180
But Hong Kong is supposed to be a free market. We conduct allegedly one of the world's freest economies.

133
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:55,510
Then we would have the ability to investigate it. Whether we are or not investigating any particular conduct at this point in time is not something I would be able to share.

134
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:24,730
The focus of the competition commission would be on any conduct that we have reasonable cause to suspect contravenes either the first conduct rule or the second conduct rule of the competition ordinance.

135
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:51,850
So what are you going to do about that? Or you would think up more sort of criteria to make sure that political clout alone, for example, is not enough for you to win any bid.

136
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:48,300
and so they can't compete with the government coffers, right? They are falling behind, and it is unfair competition they would claim. And Hong Kong economy, they would also say, is being taken over very quickly, if not.

137
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:45,020
And without going into details about how we would be inclined to look at any particular conduct, any particular types of financing arrangements or anything like that, certainly if we had the reasonable cause to suspect that particular conduct or particular financing schemes were in fact harming competition in Hong Kong.

138
00:30:52,430 --> 00:31:12,440
If there is information evidence that suggests that there is conduct taking place in Hong Kong that has you know the effect of harming competition in Hong Kong, we can look at it. But again, it it depends very much on the facts. You know, I can say.

139
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:33,660
Well, that's my response. Okay，如果冇其他議員誒再禁制，我喺呢度畫線先，好嘛？陳振英言句好唔該，主席誒喺文件度咧都披露咗咧一五年以嚟咧就一共處理咗三千五百宗投訴啦，競委會噉啊二百宗咧就初步評估裏邊。

140
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,340
嗯。

141
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,210
嗯。

142
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,910
誒，辯委回應。

143
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,990
does it bring?

144
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,000
唔該，thank you。啊，周浩鼎議員。

145
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:06,520
去使用依一個訴訟基金嘅，啊，陳生議員，佢未答你個頭兩題啊，頭兩題。

146
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:42,480
With regard to whether we have actually conducted investigations of the financial sector, however, that is something I cannot comment on, just to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of any of our investigative work.

147
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:30,990
噉我想問下啦，雖然就話誒冇講實當時嘅兩億用幾耐，你哋有冇預計咧？誒隨住而家嘅訴訟案件嘅數目咧，呢筆兩億嘅撥款咧，可以應付到你哋未來幾多年嘅訴訟支出，需唔需要咁上下咧就要翻嚟再攞錢咧？唔該。

148
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:53,860
誒有三十宗咧進行深入調查，噉我都想問下咧，作為即係代表金融界嘅即係議員咧，喺誒可唔可以披露下咧？喺呢三種唔同嘅調查裏邊咧，誒涉及金融或者銀行界嘅有幾多？你哋有冇印象咧？因為我從誒你哋嘅年報或者網頁資料就揾唔。

149
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:13,870
到呢個資料嘅，咁第二個問題咧就係誒，我知道二零一八年十月啦，證委會就公佈咗就話確定銀行營運守則咧，就誒唔會憑藉條例下邊嘅法律規定豁免咧，就獲得誒免除第一行為守則之外，但係證委會咧就認同咧銀行營運守則嘅目。

150
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:33,880
的咧係促進業界良好經營，噉就冇打算就現行版本嘅銀行營運守則咧，展開進一步嘅調查或者採取執法行動啦。噉我個人咧當然歡迎誒，競委會對銀行業界同埋銀行營運守則嘅認同。但我想問，除咗銀行工會有誒主動噉樣樣向你哋申請之外咧？

151
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:53,890
有冇其他行業嘅工會都有類似嘅申請？如果有嘅話咧，我唔知道係可唔可以透露下邊啲行業同埋有幾多個行業係做緊呢一樣同類嘅申請啦？誒，最後一個問題咧就係誒，你哋文件第十五個點咧就講到你哋嘅訴訟個案係不斷增加啦。咁政府當局咧就由

152
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:13,900
二零一八到一九年度就撥咗一筆兩億嘅專用撥款咧，就畀你哋，我嚟支持未來嘅訴訟工作。噉你哋都披露咧，就話一七年入品嘅兩宗個案咧，預計審裁處就一九年可以作出裁決。噉我相信誒相關嘅費用就會喺兩億嘅專用款項裏邊撥出嚟啦。

153
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:59,360
答下個第三條問題係關於我哋嗰個誒訴訟基金嘅嗰個二億嗰個訴訟基金。誒，我哋依一個訴訟基金，即係首先我哋好好感謝政府誒畀咗依個訴訟基金畀我哋啦。因為我哋建委會，我哋係誒有有別於有一啲。

154
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:19,370
誒外國嘅競爭機構，佢哋係可以自己去誒做一個決定，去對一啲反競爭行為，佢哋可以誒個機構自己可以誒施加啲罰款嘅。但係我哋香港行嗰個制度咧，就係我哋競委會係做咗個調查，我哋調查咗之後，我哋覺得係有case咧，我哋。

155
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:39,380
就會交畀法院去定奪嘅。噉，所以我哋都好需要誒有呢個訴訟基金。咁至於呢個訴訟基金，我哋有冇估計係可以用幾耐咧？呢個誒唔唔易講，因為真係要睇下我哋誒每年大概有幾多嘅案件會提交誒法院啦，同埋嗰啲案件嘅。

156
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:59,390
複雜程度係點樣啦？但係我哋相信呢個二億啊，二億元嘅都可以誒幫助到我哋有誒好幾年嘅誒訴訟經費嘅。咁當然，如果我哋係贏到官司嘅話，我哋亦都可以會攞翻一啲噉嘅cost嘅。咁所以我哋亦都會好小心。

157
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:27,070
I will address the first two questions. With respect to whether we have received complaints, inquiries and conducted investigations of the financial sector, I can say that we certainly have, from time to time, received complaints, inquiries about the financial sector.

158
00:35:42,760 --> 00:36:02,770
With respect to the second question, whether we have received applications for decision from any other sectors other than the financial sector related to the code of banking practice, we have. We also had received a block exemption order application from the liner shipping association in.

159
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,080
問題，因為我哋知道咧，其實查嗰啲案件。

160
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,030
對唔住啊，主席，有啲有啲後生。

161
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:21,820
將來我哋可以根據經驗再諗下，誒有啲咩地方嗰個條例會唔會都有誒改善或者再誒修訂嘅空間噉樣。

162
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:22,780
二零一六，年，that we issued a decision on in two thousand and seventeen, and more recently we have received an application for decision from the Hong Kong Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, which we received in January and hope to release a decision on later this year. Okay.

163
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:45,710
誒唔該啊，主席噉就有三個問題啦。第一個問題咧就係啊，過去我自己一路都提咧，就算競委會成立嘅時候，我都有個意見啊。目前咧，因為而家我哋嘅競爭條例咧都仲未能夠容許個私人訴訟嘅安排，所有違反競爭嘅行為當然都係透過你哋啊。

164
00:36:45,710 --> 00:37:05,720
即係去檢控啦，甚至乎去處理嗰個訴訟。其實私人訴訟咧，我我自己就認為都係多一個渠道。咁如果人哋未必去到啊你哋嘅層面去協助去做嗰個競委會嘅檢控，其實有啲人可能選擇用私人訴訟嘅方式都可以解決到問題。咁其實我就想知道呢方面。

165
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:25,730
究竟而家敬委會或者政府有冇任何諗法？因為就算啊胡鴻濤主席都曾經係講過，如果敬委會運作咗一段時間之後咧，係可以去諗下睇下係咪可以去用私人訴訟嘅途徑去容許噉嘅處理。咁呢個就第一點啦。第二個問題咧就係關於而家敬委會個人手。

166
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:53,430
嗰個競委會咧，好多時我要做任何嘅調查，特別係關於違反競爭行為。根據過去外國嘅經驗咧，就係一單案件都用好長嘅時間，因為好複雜。噉我主要就想知道下，其實而家競委會你哋嘅人手處理夠唔夠咧？即係如果你唔夠，你要開聲，因為我哋儘量希望咧，你哋。

167
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:13,440
有足夠嘅人手去處理嗰啲案件，因為而家個個投訴亦都越嚟越多嘅。第三個問題咧就係關於嗰個油價嗰個合謀定價嘅指控嘅問題。其實而好多市民都依然係對於嗰啲油站合謀定價嘅質疑係存在好大嘅一個嘅指控喺裏面。咁大家都感覺係噉嘅，不。

168
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:33,450
個唔知點解，即係經委會可能出咗份報告，講到好似係冇呢個合謀定價。咁但係我就想追問一樣嘢，就係話誒，經委會個報告都曾經提過，如果要解決個油價高嗰個問題咧，係唔係應該可以引入一啲其他性質嘅汽油產品，包括唔係淨係而家單一嘅九十八R？

169
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:53,460
L.O.N嗰只產品，而係有，比如話九十五L.O.N嘅產品，你畀人哋多個選擇，噉啊有機會可以有多啲競爭咯。咁呢個其實都一個辦法嚟嘅喎。咁但係我又唔知道呢方面嘅推進，政府方面有冇去真係積極咁去考慮去處理呢個噉嘅問題咧？唔該啊，主席。誒，邊位回答？啊，OK。

170
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:13,470
羅小姐，主席唔該誒，我答咗第一條問題，關於私人訴訟先啦。誒，其實政府喺二零一零年向立法會提交呢個競爭條例草案嗰陣時咧，裏邊係有條文容許呢個獨立私人訴訟㗎。咁即係如果任何人啦，如果佢覺得誒佢受到一個反競爭。

171
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:33,480
嘅行為影響而蒙受損失咧，當時政府嘅建議就係誒可以向呢個競爭事務審裁處提出訴訟㗎。咁但係其實係就係喺呢個誒草案審議嘅期間啦，咁有唔同嘅意見，包括當時就中小企就表示好憂慮咧。呢一個誒獨立私人訴訟呢一個噉樣嘅條文咧，就。

172
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,450
issued report。

173
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,190
到到原則，或自由市場經濟。

174
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,990
Would you be able to confirm one way or the other based on your?

175
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,160
down with adjustment of the oil prices because it's a matter of supply and demand and it's you know we have to hear

176
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:50,960
但係，我我 do think there is a case that you need to launch a more comprehensive study.

177
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:19,490
are different. I mean, different. All companies have different cost structures. So, what is the rationale of having a

178
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:12,510
of course they are they may be giving out different types of discount, but bearing in mind their core structures.

179
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:14,950
同油站雖然嗰個牌價係一樣，但係最終你嗰個消費者買嗰個人係畀嗰個價錢係咪一樣？可能係唔同嘅。O K，好啦，誒過過咗好多時間，梁繼昌議員。

180
00:42:51,240 --> 00:43:04,760
on whether there is a cartel, I mean existing amongst the oil companies. As, as Mr. Butt has already pointed out, right, the prices charged by the oil companies are the same.

181
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:34,140
same， you know， off-the-shelf price in the pump station， it it it does not make any sense. Of course， there can be two explanations to this phenomena. One is that it is a perfectly competitive market.

182
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:52,790
which I don't think your report has mentioned it because they're selling homogeneous product and it is a perfectly competitive market. If that is the case, and I I I won't raise any more issue. Second, of course, it would be a cartel. There would be price fixing. Even the rate of adjustment of those prices.

183
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:53,490
可能令到佢哋被大企業咧濫用，就變咗誒，即係畀大企業濫用呢個條文，就係打壓啲中小企，咁認為好擔心。咁所以當時政府都聽咗各方意見之後咧，就刪除咗呢個條文㗎。咁誒，即係所以當初政府嘅本意係想有呢一個條文喺度㗎。咁咁當然誒，而家誒競爭條例都話。

184
00:39:53,490 --> 00:40:13,500
運行咗三年幾噉樣樣噉，如果你話誒將來會唔會都有個空間再一次檢討呢件事咧？噉我哋都覺得誒，其實可以即係當當個條條例再運行多啲，同埋誒當有多啲嘅誒訴訟嘅個案，同埋都都有立誒法庭都有裁決嘅話咧，其實。

185
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:42,880
啊，北生簡單回應唔該。係，誒，主席，我可以答埋另外兩條問題。第一條問題就係關於我哋嘅人手方面。咁而家人手方面，我哋大概有六十二個位同事嘅，一半嘅同事係做調查誒執法嘅。咁依一個數目，你話誒多唔多，少唔少？咁其實我。

186
00:40:42,880 --> 00:41:02,890
我哋亦都誒要因應我哋而家去做嗰啲誒誒案件啊，咁暫時我哋覺得係足夠嘅。噉我哋亦都唔想話一下子我哋加太多人。咁同埋隨住我哋越嚟越多多嘅案件，我哋亦都發覺我哋自己啲同事嗰啲能力亦都越嚟越誒高啦。

187
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:22,900
啦，誒，亦都佢哋做得更加誒有效率啦。咁所以我哋暫時即係好多謝議員你嘅關心。我哋暫時我哋覺得係足夠嘅。咁至於誒另外一個問題係關於油價嗰方面。噉我想重申一點，當日我哋誒推出依個誒誒報告啦，依個車用燃油報告。

188
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:42,910
好咯，其實我哋唔係話做咗一個概觀定論，話一定係冇合謀依樣嘢。我哋當日誒想講搞清楚一樣嘢，就係如果單單係話唔同嘅油站佢哋收嗰個排費，即係誒係一樣咧，同一個價咧，嗰一個唔係話一個好。

189
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,500
或任何conduct in the wet markets is

190
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:03,640
companies that run the wet markets or by LinkReit, we would certainly investigate it under the competition ordinance.

191
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:51,040
我 do have concerns that a study like that would not ultimately be particularly effective or answer the questions I think you are rightfully raising.

192
00:46:52,550 --> 00:47:10,570
又係佢嘅子公司買凍肉，又係噉。然之後咧，你又發現咧，原來豬肉嘅後邊咧嗰個批發商咧都係佢間公司，即係佢一條龍啦。連供應到到零售，甚至租埋嗰啲鋪都係佢嗰間公司。咁其實呢啲又有冇違反到呢個競爭行為咧？咁？

193
00:41:42,910 --> 00:42:02,920
好實質嘅證據證明係有合謀定價依樣嘢嘅，因為所謂平衡定價，你有一個油站係charge住個價，跟住另外一個跟隨佢噉。依一個喺經濟上唔係話一個歧視噉。兼夾亦都喺香港，我哋有一個誒折扣誒，好多油站都有折扣嘅。咁所以你如果話去入油喺唔同，

194
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:35,440
Thank you, Chairman. I just want to follow up on the issue of the oil companies as well. Our honourable members, Mr. Houdenciar and also Mr. Yik, has already raised some issues. Now, primarily, I'm not concerned about the profit margins of the oil companies, nor am I concerned about the rate of

195
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:21,740
Or, if you're not unable to do so, would you be considering launching a more comprehensive and in-depth study on the issue of cartel and price fixing for the oil companies? Thank you. Okay, be my. I'll go ahead and address that question. Certainly, we know that the.

196
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:41,750
Auto fuel prices are an issue of some significant public concern, and certainly the prices warrant that, given that they are quite high. Obviously, as I think you've already acknowledged, the fact that prices may be high is not in and of itself an indication that any cartel is in existence.

197
00:44:41,750 --> 00:45:01,760
or that there is any anti-competitive conduct that is that's occurring. However, if we were to develop evidence or get information that suggests that there was such conduct going on, and we had a reasonable cause to suspect that a cartel was in place amongst the oil companies, then we certainly would.

198
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:21,770
investigate it using our investigative powers, with respect to whether a more in-depth study would be warranted or would possibly be effective in assessing whether a cartel has taken place. You know, we can certainly take that under advisement and and consider.

199
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:41,780
I think one of the challenges related to conducting such a study, however, would be that we would need to develop information in order to really properly assess that market, assess pricing in the industry and things like that. And without the ability to compel information in connection with the study,

200
00:45:52,520 --> 00:46:12,530
有冇冇跟住？O.K.麥美娟議嘅。主席，我想問下咧，就係誒，警方會唔會咧，即係或者曾經有冇做過一啲誒調查啦？係關於而家喺好多誒，特別係領匯誒，即係而家領展佢哋旗下嗰啲嘅街市嗰個誒誒經營嘅方法，究竟？

201
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:32,540
有冇違反呢個誒競爭嘅行為咧？因為誒，我哋以前咧，我哋記得誒，你曾經咧喺未成立之前咧，曾經有調查過關於東湧咧，就係發現咧喺東湧日東村嘅街市裏邊咧，原來幾檔都係即係所有嘅賣豬肉嗰檔咧，都係同一個公司嘅噉，有唔同嘅名，但係原來。

202
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:52,550
轉轉背後咧都係同一個老細。咁而家嘅情況更加嚴重嘅就係領匯佢哋自從將一啲街市咧外判咗畀某間公司咧去經營咗一個承包之後咧，噉啊連咧佢哋賣豬肉又係佢嘅子公司，賣魚又係佢嘅子公司，然之後賣雞咧。

203
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,970
嚇，因為咧。

204
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,630
頭先誒商經局嗰個答案咧，我就唔係幾滿意嘅。

205
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,330
搶噉就係啦，咁所以即係我自己覺得咧，誒。

206
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:08,040
誒又唔一定係因為係環境局，所以佢哋就偏向某一方面。噉我哋政府都係整體噉樣睇嘅。嗱，我再補充啊，阿主席。

207
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:17,200
喺個誒土地使用嗰度咧，係一個比較大嘅變化。咁但係商經局有個角色㗎嘛，就係點樣維係香港嗰個個營商環境。而家係即係畀人即係。

208
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:38,100
市民能夠享受一個咧較為合理嘅油價嘅問題嘅啫，即係主席，我唔知應該點跟進啊嚇，即係你咪呢個明日呢個大眾市民係好關注呢樣嘢，亦好不滿嘅，噉啊，所以係咪羅小姐回應下？

209
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:39,690
依一樣嘢嘅，有警戒。下一位陸仲雄議員唔喺度，再跟住胡志偉議員唔喺度，再跟住譚文浩議員唔喺度，就跟住笑。O.K.，阿譚志明議員，好啊，唔該主席。

210
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:31,740
Anyway, I'm happy to address that question. We are aware of the public interest in the wet markets and and links' role in the wet markets. Whether we have studied that or not, whether we have investigated whether links' conduct.

211
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:56,250
raises a possible contravention of of the conduct rules of the competition ordinance. I I can't confirm. Needless to say, if we do develop information or evidence that gives us a reasonable cause to suspect that either there's conduct by any of the

212
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:23,940
O.K.誒噉啊，雖然你哋唔能夠confirm究竟有冇做緊，但係我都希望你哋真係有冇都好。如果你真係冇嘅，噉我真係請你哋都研究下，因為呢個其實誒，正如頭先好多同事都講關於有嘅問題，呢啲其實係我哋市民生活好好貼身嘅一啲嘢啦。咁呢個係對我哋嗰個影響咧好嚴重，所以誒，而且我哋見。

213
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:43,950
到嗰個趨勢喺近年咧係越嚟越嚴重，因為呢個集團咧，自從畀Link咧畀畀領展噉樣去誒栽培佢之後咧，佢規模越嚟越大啊。佢嗰個train，佢嗰個佢嗰條鏈咧係可以做到越嚟越大嗰個誒影響嘅範圍，其實越嚟越緊要。所以我就好希望你哋真係可以認真去調查。另外一個。

214
00:48:43,950 --> 00:49:03,960
咧就係想問關於喺一啲嘅公共屋邨裏邊，誒石油氣嗰個供應嘅問題。我相信誒知道你哋之前都有個研究嘅噉，其實誒亦都要誒房署開始去做一個招標啦。即係以前就係唔招標㗎，咁而家開始做咗招標啦。其實喺呢方面，你哋有冇啲咩嘅跟進嘅工作咧？或者你可唔可以再講一講你哋上次嗰個做咗？

215
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:23,970
關於誒屋村嘅石油氣供應，即係唔想畀某啲誒誒供應商壟斷嗰個情況係啊，阿畢生好快咁講一講啦。誒，當日我哋做咗一個誒意見公告嘅誒，就係就住依個啊家用石油氣嗰個誒模式。誒，當其時嗰個。

216
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:43,980
個誒房協嗰個做法就係佢哋會誒之前已經有個固有嘅供應商嘅，咁到咗誒有一個特定嘅年期，到咗差唔多最尾嗰陣時，佢哋就會以前嘅做法就會決定誒問下啲誒居民，你覺得過去咁多年誒佢哋做得好唔好啊？

217
00:49:43,980 --> 00:50:03,990
咁如果做得好咧，就會繼續再畀多誒若干年。我我唔係好清楚記得，大概有十年到嘅。咁噉樣續落去嘅。咁當其時我哋睇到依個做法，我哋覺得其實如果咁噉樣繼續咧，就會誒不斷都係嗰個固有嗰個供應商會繼續去供應㗎啦。咁所以我哋就畀咗意見畀。

218
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:24,000
佢哋係採應該採用一個招標嘅形式。當你個年期到嗰陣時咧，應該再公開招標，睇下會唔會有第二啲嘅供應商，而佢哋會唔會嗰個喺價錢嗰方面亦都會誒提供一啲更相宜嘅。咁依依個我哋誒據我哋所知，房協都有跟進到而。

219
00:50:45,250 --> 00:51:05,260
誒，我唔知競委會有冇機會可以再同呢個相關嘅政府部門去傾下我哋以前嗰個建議啦。如果有需要，我好樂意參與添嚇。咁事實我都同環境局咧係詳細解釋過我個諗法嘅。咁但係當然呢個咧牽涉到香港喺嗰個過往所謂招標。

220
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,860
it。

221
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,260
OK，邊位會議？

222
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,960
因為你見到咧，而家油價咧。

223
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,630
OK，他們何以？

224
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:18,290
由冇競委會變咗有競委會，仍然都係噉樣，呢個係接受唔到嘅，大眾市民。

225
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:12,370
咁咧，可唔可以講一講啦？其實我啱啱都寫一個動議交畀主席嘅啦，就係我覺得油公司係絕對好大問題，我覺得競委會係絕對要查。

226
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:36,570
Will a a motion from from the Lechko panel be sufficient for us to start an investigation?

227
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:27,110
Actually submit a motion to the chairman just now and to urge for your commission to start an investigation. Would that be sufficient for you to start the procedures?

228
00:54:52,260 --> 00:55:04,080
噉啊，更加係咪？甚至乎喺外國好多地方，就係話同一間油公司喺唔同嘅地點，佢哋嘅油價都可以係唔同。其實咁先係正常㗎嘛。咁但係香港唔係噉樣嘅喎。

229
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:38,820
If we have reasonable cause to suspect that there is a cartel amongst the oil companies, then we would have the ability to investigate and we would investigate. Whether we are in fact investigating is not something I can publicly confirm.

230
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:44,230
有好多嘅油站嘅地咧，係需要再次招標，所以係提速提供咗一個契機咧，有一個大大程度嘅一個變更。咁呢個係個制度上嘅變更嚟嘅。我知道政府係要考慮，但問題就係而家環境局諗都唔諗啊嘛～

231
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:56,150
誒同埋好一樣有冇跟住？哦，okay，in in in that regard，okay，what do you need to start off your investigations？Is that obvious enough？I mean，like all those，you know，company they selling the price at exactly same time，same price。

232
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:42,630
政府又有個責任嘅，但係咧，我就唔係好唔明咧，就點解油價嘅監管咧會跌咗落去環境局？我覺得咧應該翻返去商經局，佢係恰當啲嘅嚇。咁然之後你先會有一個責任啊嘛，因為環境局而家就係我睇環境嘅啫，你啲價格都唔關佢事嘅，所以佢佢哋睇佢嘅答案，佢即係大家都唔收貨啊。咁究竟如何跟進咧？

233
00:51:42,630 --> 00:52:02,640
即係係咪我哋以後都唔改變咧？即係你而家嗰個唔好嗱，當然我哋冇證據證明佢而家係有一個叫合謀定價啦。不過高度一致性咧，嗱呢個就即係冇人會否定嘅。咁點解可以會高度一致性嘅咧？啊，當然個燃油價格入嚟香港嗰一刻咧，大家都知啊，都係來自新加坡嘅。咁但係每一個

234
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:22,650
個營辦商佢嘅內部營運成本係會有唔同，因為我唔係淨係做零售，我都有buy purchase去買油嘅。我知道個制度係點行嘅。而家政府亦都唔係冇嘅，就係嗰個石油氣嗰個嘅用方程式嚟定價方法，基本上係存在嘅。而家只不過政府係願唔願意接受一個變化，令到。

235
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:58,460
嗯，主席，嗯啊，議員講得啱。誒，而家油價嘅事宜其實誒嗰個政策局就係環境局嘅。不過我相信其實無論係環境局定係商經局，我哋從來做每一個政策或者誒去檢討每一個政策嗰陣時，我哋都係睇曬所有有關嘅因素嘅噉，所以。

236
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:28,330
我個建議嘅即係仿效誒LPG即係石油氣嗰個嘅方程式定價咧。其實我係同呢個消費者委員會溝通過，佢當時都提出啲疑問。我解釋咗之後咧，佢都認為可行嘅。噉我同競委會嘅溝通咧，我都覺得你哋係認同我個方法係可行嘅嚇。所以你哋咧喺個上一次嘅文件報告咧就話因為。

237
00:53:49,970 --> 00:54:09,980
誒多謝主席。誒嗱，我都係想講翻油價呢一個問題嘅。頭先咧，即係政府當局咧，阿羅小姐咧，你就即係我都花咗啲時間嚟聽你答畢葉志明議員講嘅答法，其實即係都係繼續研究噉嘅啫。你可唔可以畀多一啲實質啲嘅嘢，係未來諗住點樣做？嗱，因為

238
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:32,250
誒，即係叫做高位回落咗咁多啦。但係其實而家油價係不斷創新高，而最離譜一樣嘢就係話，你會見到唔同嘅油公司、唔同嘅油站，佢哋賣同一個價錢。而所謂嘅同一個價錢係爭住個cents，去到幾多仙都係一樣嘅喎。即係呢一個先係最大問題啊嘛。咁如果你話喺噉，

239
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,440
主席，我嘅動議要求經委會查啊嘛。

240
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:26,170
係會有啲新嘢係會攞出嚟，係會控制個油價噉樣嘅咧？唔該，政府。

241
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:59,230
certainly the facts that you are calling to our attention are facts that we can take into consideration. However, in in making that assessment.

242
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:53,100
油價嘅，當年啲人就成日覺得啲油就係永遠都係升嘅時候，我哋就香港第一時間就隔夜就演升跌嘅話咧。

243
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:20,160
我唔係話講話政府個個政策，我個動野寫叫警會查啊！咁同警會有我再同李處長傾偈。噉啊，啊邵家輝議員誒問先。

244
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:24,600
呢個係一個重點，希望你能夠做到嘅嘢嚟。嗱，到今日啦，噉啊，睇逆志明議員即係舉咗好多例子講畀你聽啦，即係頭先講緊嗰啲嘅啊啊。

245
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:56,980
係咪？即係嗱，你講就話其實你哋冇執法權啦。咁嗱，啊，今日其實競委會就係under商經局啦。噉啊，商經局就揾咗阿阿阿羅小姐喺度啦。係咪？即係誒。

246
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:49,740
We have to have evidence that gives us a reasonable cause to suspect. That is the standard in the ordinance, and if we don't have that, we cannot open an investigation and exercise our formal powers.

247
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:45,460
啊，羅羅女士，羅小姐，主席。誒，由於油價嘅誒政策局其實係環境局啦，而我都理解佢就住呢個題目，其實之前喺環境事務委員會都交代過、彙報過嘅。咁誒，如果誒議員有啲咩提問或者有咩意見，我樂意轉交畀佢哋嘅。

248
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:44,160
尤其柴油噉樣啦，柴油直頭政府其實嗰六蚊税都唔收嘅，係咪？但係而家都喺出面都係賣緊十四啊幾銀錢。你嗰啲你嗰啲正式嗰啲油都係賣十七啊幾，佢收你六蚊税，佢都賣十七啊幾。噉你點解嗰個唔收六蚊税嘅話，去到賣十四啊幾？即係你你噉佢噉佢咪賺到飛起？

249
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:52,260
嘅情況即係你都覺得佢哋唔係合謀定價嘅話咧，我都唔知點樣先先算係啦。你同我講話，即係譬如你話誒投個地誒投個地嗰個標嘅價唔同，係啊，又或者佢攞嘅油地方唔同，所以會牽涉到佢可能定價唔同，係啊。噉我哋應該先見到就係話唔同油公司應該唔同價錢先啦。

250
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:16,440
down to cents, okay, we're talking about down to a single cent. That is, you know, pretty to me, it's pretty obvious evidence that you know those old company well certainly something going on. And I think for your commissions, it's you know you should you know initiate in in investigation on that. For that regard, I.

251
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:19,810
O.K.嗱，噉我當咗即係而家，我哋一個希望陣間會通過啦，大家噉啊一個希望正式我哋起碼個立場畀conditions，O.K.噉你話嗰啲evidence，頭先我講過㗎啦。只要你睇一睇郵站，你行出街望一望都知㗎啦。嗰啲evidence係咪先？咁好啦，翻返政府嗰度啦，政府嗰度其實有冇啲乜嘢？

252
00:57:46,160 --> 00:58:06,170
誒，同埋要議員，事實上油價或者誒油呢樣嘢係屬於環境局嘅。噉我唔誒同秘書處傾過咧，即係今次因為係紀委會係報告佢哋個，即係呢段時間做過啲乜嘢，所以變咗誒你嘅動議咧，應該翻翻去環境。唔係。

253
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:40,450
哦，係唔該，謝嗱，我都係即係關於嗰個誒有嗰方面嗰個問題嘅嗱。我想睇題咧，即係誒競爭事務委員會咧，即係我印象中其實當年成立咧，即係即係呢個委員會，其實喺坊間都有好多討論，咁好多吸引好多市民支持你哋去成立呢個委員會，其中一個。

254
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,030
其實。

255
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,180
畀你放收女仔，賴咗兩句。

256
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,220
多謝議員嘅提問。嗯。

257
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,220
好啦，唔該，係咪啊，羅小姐繼續回應？

258
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,510
我咧，即係嘅焦點就係打擊。

259
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,920
咁而家即係啲油價咁高，即係一路都係噉，佢做咗啲咩啊？

260
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,310
咁噉，我想問關於啲油價嗰度，噉佢建議有啲咩做得到啊？做啲咩啊？

261
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,150
交畀環境局，跟住環保局，佢一定講畀人你，你加價減價個價錢唔啱，係咪有競爭？關佢咩事啊？

262
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:50,600
噉你喺度推嚟推咁又推幾年？你擺上嚟，你又係揾你出嚟畀我哋制其鬧嘅啫喎！嗱，你係女仔，話鬧少兩句，咁但係咁咁點搞咧？

263
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:32,640
樓係環境，即係影響環境。大家明白講銀紙啊嘛，講銀紙你推畀佢做咩咧？你講銀紙一定係雙邊局㗎啦。而家根本就係講緊佢嘅價格嘅問題。全香港啲人都係歪言咗好多年，得個嗌字。每一次嗌完之後咁點咧？

264
00:58:53,380 --> 00:59:13,390
國際油價跌極嘅話咧，我哋都跌唔到啊嘛！即係喺新聞上邊，我哋成日都係每日都係報住咪國際油價等等嘅情況，而我哋親眼亦都係目睹我哋嘅油站嘅價錢係幾多錢，大家都係見得到。所以當年成立呢個你哋事務委員會嘅話咧，好多香港市民都支持，好多議員都支持。

265
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:17,590
我知啊，局長佢哋好多嘢，就話局長啊成日要飛，係咪？副局長有好多法例要做，咁但係即係淨係靠你一個來啊，羅小姐，你頂唔住啊！即係老老實實，即係頭先我聽落去，葉生即係議員問你嗰啲問題，你講嚟講去又講翻去環境局，係咪？噉你都要諗個方法，唔係諗個方法，你喺度推嚟推去嘅喎。即係環境局啊，睇環境嘅油，嗰啲油。

266
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:22,910
因為政府做一個政策嗰陣時，係要睇唔同方面嘅因素。我嘅理解，環境局當佢哋考慮競委會之前就住油價呢一個嘅市場研究報告嗰陣時，其實都係佢哋唔係淨係睇環境呢個角度，亦都會諗誒。如果有啲改動，將來對於消費者佢哋要畀嘅油價係多咗。

267
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:42,920
定少咗啊，或者有啲嘢嘅實際嘅可行性啊等等方面，其實佢哋都有全盤去諗嘅。咁所以誒，我哋誒都相信環境局係全面地諗咗之後，佢哋誒決定就係有部分競委會嘅建議，佢哋可以實施得到；有部分咧就覺得暫時未做得到㗎嘛。

268
01:01:51,280 --> 01:02:11,290
嗯，其實競委會嗰個誒嗰個報告裏邊有唔同方面嘅嘅建議嘅，我記得有大概六定五定六個噉樣嘅。咁同埋有一啲覺得誒話嗰個油價要清楚噉樣喺嗰個誒油站度標示出嚟咧，呢等等嘅。

269
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:31,340
嘅建議咧，其實環境局係做得到嘅。咁當然有啲其他誒進行即係比較結構性嘅建議，就覺得難啲喺我我同你講，一定係唔得咯。環境嗰個黃錦星自己都搞唔掂啦。嗰啲咩固體收費嗰啲，全部都畀人冚曬旗咁滯。你仲交呢一嚿，佢自己直接負責嗰啲又搞唔掂。你呢嚿嘢唔關係，你交畀佢搞，你攞翻。

270
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:51,350
啲權力畀翻競委會等競委會搞啦，如果唔係講咩永遠都搞唔掂啊！跟住陸續嘅議員，誒多謝主席。誒工聯會一直都係關注咧能源一個公平競爭嘅問題嘅。第一個問題咧就係油價嘅問題誒。當其時競委會咧都提出過咧，即係建議可以賣九五油。咁但係油公司咧咁多年嚟都冇即係跟。

271
01:02:51,350 --> 01:03:11,360
上呢方面嘅建議，我想了解下，經委會咧會再做啲乜嘢？同埋油公司咧現時即係佢採購嘅誒成品油咧，以我理解啊，基本上都係喺同一間嘅新加坡嘅煉油廠。點解佢哋冇去其他東南亞鄰近嘅地區去做一個公平公開嘅採購？

272
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,000
阿爸啲，antan。

273
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:52,830
定價，然後係嗰個價格係向下調嘅話，係咪理論上即？

274
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:27,050
代主席唔好意思啊，誒，我我想問下就可能有同事問過都唔定嘅，關於呢個係海港聯盟嗰個問題啊，噉就誒，因為佢哋夾埋咧仲同營運緊超過九成嘅泊位啦，咁誒。

275
01:07:53,740 --> 01:08:11,150
如果真係噉樣樣走啊，如果調翻轉，當然係唔通啦，係咪啊？即係佢係令到嗰個嘅係自己競爭力係會增加，令到個消費者係會有得益嘅話，咁呢一個係對嗰個條例嘅理解上面係咪都應該有個正面嘅考慮咧？係邊位？

276
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:31,370
後咧，內地嘅、台灣嘅、越南嘅等等，含沖冇煉油廠咩？嚇，係咪會價格會比新加坡平咧？係嘛？至於即係我相信消費者都應該有唔同嘅選擇嘅。第二個咧就係石油氣嘅投標機制，特別係喺政府嘅公共屋邨，誒仍然有一部分嘅屋邨。

277
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:51,380
咧係用嘅石油氣嘅，誒我知道咧政府咧做緊個誒試驗嘅計劃，先導嘅計劃，咁但係咧仍然有屋村咧就係未公開招標，亦都有一啲咧係一啲舊標咧，佢誒延長咗個時限嘅。誒，我想條間嘅競委會咧就住呢關方面咧石油氣嘅喺屋村裏邊嘅。

278
01:03:51,380 --> 01:04:11,390
招標咧，我會畀政府進一步嘅建議嚇，要求佢哋咧做開一個好嘅招標。特別係個招標咧，唔能夠淨係話話你畀政府嘅錢租，關鍵就係你畀啲用家幾多嘅優惠。因為而家政府個招標咧，其實都好業主導向嘅，就係你畀佢你。

279
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:31,400
畀幾錢房署多啲，我咪畀個位你賣石油氣咯。咁其實誒居民啊，即係啲屋村嘅住户咧，冇冇受惠嘅。最後就係好多人近期關注嗰個國泰收購Hong Kong Express嗰件事，誒是否會造成一個誒壟斷嘅情況？

280
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:51,410
警委會點睇？即係國泰喂，佢貴又做，平又做，噉啊，即係佢咪玩曬咯？即係同埋佢，即係會唔會喺嗰個誒市場，即係特別係某啲線路咧，譬如好似去日本嘅線路，佔成一半，咁會唔會係涉及一個可能係壟斷嘅情況咧？警委會喺嗰個現

281
01:04:51,410 --> 01:05:11,420
時嗰個合併守則裏邊係誒係咪淨係應用喺電信業務係咪唔夠咧？係咪應該都要擴展去其他行業咧？唔該主席。呢個呢個正話有委員都問過，不過好簡單嘅回再回應一次，好嘛？阿畢生主席，不如由我答依幾個問題啦。咁第一第一個問題係關。

282
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:31,430
關於話誒，我我哋其中上次做依個車用燃油報告，我哋其中一個誒誒提議嘅就係引入九十五辛烷值汽油嘅，因為依依一樣嘢我哋其實真係百思不得其解，點點解香港會淨係得九十八辛烷值？九十八辛烷值係一個最。

283
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:51,440
高級別嘅汽油嚟嘅，咁而我哋亦都有當時亦都有委託大學做一個研究。其實香港嘅車大大概九成九嘅車都可以用九十五辛烷值汽油，而喺國際上，如果係九十五辛烷值嘅汽油對比九十八辛烷值汽油咧，其實都會有一個價格上嘅分。

284
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,670
OK。

285
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,280
哦。

286
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,920
係啊！

287
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:26,240
聯營啦，嚇嗰個範圍啦，簡單講就係噉樣樣。

288
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,770
It really depends on on the facts and.

289
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:20,810
即係或者海港聯盟嗰個問題，其實會唔會跌咗入去嗰個嘅係所謂合謀？

290
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:55,830
contravene the first conduct rule, which would potentially apply to issues related to pricing.

291
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:34,170
哦，我其實我想係借呢個場合咧，等你澄清一下，就因為喺呢個背景裏邊咧。

292
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:40,180
and make an assessment of the possible efficiencies that flow from it, and that requires an investigation.

293
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:03,730
到競委會嗰個條例嘅係規範咧，即係嗱，當你調查結果，我知一件事，但係即係我都想知呢一個係條界線咪噉樣劃咁解啫。

294
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:27,600
We have made that investigation a matter of of priority for the commission, and it's our hope that we will be in a position to wrap up the investigation by the first quarter of 2020.

295
01:05:51,440 --> 01:06:11,450
別嘅九十五係會低啲，譬如喺新加坡佢大概係有十幾個percent嘅嘅分別嘅。咁誒，但係喺香港嚟講，我哋有兩種汽油，就係誒特級又或者補通嘅汽油，但係其實兩隻都係九十八新遠值汽油。咁所以依依一個我哋係有啲唔明義香。

296
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:31,460
香港依兩個汽油同屬九十八新遠值，但係佢哋都有一個價格分歧，係大概個幾銀錢嘅。咁所以如果佢哋都有個幾銀錢嘅誒分別啦，咁點解九啊八？如果你係引入到九啊五，點解九啊五會有可能平啲咧？依個係第一個問題。第二個問題就係點解油公司會？

297
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:51,470
誒多數啲人都係由新加坡運入嚟啦。咁據我哋所知，其實香港誒四間其中四間嘅油公司，佢哋嘅煉油廠就係設喺新加坡嘅。咁依個亦都係佢哋誒向我哋解釋點解佢哋啲油會係喺新加坡嗰度入嚟，而唔係喺第啲地方嘅。咁至

298
01:06:51,470 --> 01:07:11,480
於第三條問題就係關於誒誒，不談呢個不如講一講石油氣嗰度啦。唔唔誒，太過曬鐘㗎啦。我而家最後啊，胡志偉議員仲要處理譚文浩議員嗰個動議，但係你正話問嗰個問題，正話喺第二啲委員嗰度都問咗，都要有回應咗㗎啦。噉啊，阿胡志偉議員最後唔該誒。

299
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:47,340
第一，我唔知噉樣樣嘅，當然我知係調查當中嘅，啊，咁表面上咧就會誒有一個可能係合謀工作啦，我唔一定係定價啦，合謀工作嘅狀態。咁但係誒，當我哋講合謀定價好，合謀工作都好啦，咁其實都牽涉到就係公眾利益嘅裁斷嘅，即係如果佢合謀。

300
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:49,930
As we have indicated last January, we have an open investigation related to the Hong Kong Seaport Alliance, and in particular whether the agreement that they've reached, the joint venture agreement, and the way that they intend to intend to conduct their their alliance would come.

301
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:16,160
And so, as part of the investigation, we will be looking at those issues and also at issues related to efficiencies that this alliance may raise that bring benefits to consumers in Hong Kong. But all of those issues are wrapped up in this investigation that's ongoing.

302
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:54,620
如果係經營者去聯聯營嘅之後咧，係會令到個efficiency提高，同埋嗰個價格係向下調嘅話，咁即係喺呢一種背景下邊嘅聯營，其實係咪都可以好清楚向公眾去即係表述，就係話如果噉樣樣嘅話，咁其實係唔會受。

303
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:33,320
The mere fact that a the competitors could get together and agree to lower prices rather than raise prices is not conclusive one way or the other as to whether the conduct is pro-competitive or efficiency-enhancing. You really have to look at the totality of of the conduct.

304
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:46,340
哦。

305
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,630
禁制排隊。

306
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,750
嚇，撳機啊！唔該。

307
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,020
嘅系統最新嘅發展。

308
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,480
個香港國際機場三跑。

309
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,990
誒認唔認同要處理呢個動議先？

310
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:42,350
大家認同OK？如果處理呢個動議，大家通唔通過呢個動議？

311
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:26,370
本會誒促請經委經委會立即。

312
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:34,160
立刻就此事展開即正式調查，以保障本港消費者嘅權益。關於油價，咁大家。

313
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:50,570
大家通就，大家舉手贊成通過呢個動議。O.K.，如果大家都一致通過，誒。

314
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:18,280
誒，同埋佢嘅機管局嘅總經理環境事務三跑項目李仲騰先生，同埋機管局嘅財務執行總監啊，羅志聰先生。

315
01:12:46,620 --> 01:13:05,190
運防局嘅機場擴展統籌辦嘅總監鄭念泰先生，同埋呢個運防局嘅助理秘書長楊麗珊女士，就仲就另外機管局咧就會有誒行政總裁潘嘉宏先生。

316
01:10:41,950 --> 01:11:01,960
誒明白，噉我想問下喺個報告裏邊，其實會唔會就住呢一點咧都有所係即係説明咧？因為如果唔係講，我可以想象到就係而家level嗰個嘅係即係經營者咧，因為佢係九成剩翻有十一成，咁可能係受害者都唔頂嘅，相對嚟講。咁因為噉樣樣嘅時候，佢可能就最有可能。

317
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:21,970
可能係運用呢一個嘅係法例，畀佢嗰個嘅係權力，然後就係佢一路追住競委會要judge，而家呢個九成嘅係海港聯盟咧，反而係所做係令到市場競爭改善、價格下降，係反而係有違法行為。我要處理譚文豪議員嗰個動議啦。噉啊，佢嘅動議就係促請。

318
01:11:51,700 --> 01:12:11,710
呢個動議，我相信都冇人棄反對同棄權嘅，係嘛？噉啊，通過咗就我哋而家促請警委會就係積極去處理調查香港嗰個油價係唔係有呢個壟斷嘅行為。OK，唔該大家。咁因為時間，我哋要跟住處理呢個。

319
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:45,870
誒哦，好唔該。政府當局同埋機管局咧，就會有一個電腦投影片嘅，就介紹畀委員知而家三跑嘅最新嘅情況。咁而家請誒政府官員就包括有誒運防局嘅副副局長阿蘇偉文博士，有誒。

320
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:38,570
噉啊，副局係邊位去介紹呢個三跑？誒，主席，我哋會有首先會有個簡單嘅開場發言，跟住機管局同事會做一個簡短嘅叫做簡報嘅。誒，主席各位委員，香港國際機場一直係全球最繁忙機場之一。二零一八年，香港國際機場接待旅客超過七千。

321
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,400
多謝主席。

322
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,350
Kevin， please. Thank you.

323
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:59,440
And as always, scheduled to be done during this year.

324
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:35,700
包括both sloping seawall and vertical seawall。There is extensive ground improvement works that have been done within the footprint of the reclamation。

325
01:15:51,310 --> 01:16:01,870
三跑道項目執行總監潘嘉雲先生同埋佢嘅同事簡介三跑道系統項目嘅最新嘅進展，多謝主席。唔該，副局。

326
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:30,990
繼改善海牀地質嘅深層水泥拌合工程後，機管局及其承建商喺去年五月展開填料鋪設工程。稍後機管局同事會詳細介紹有關工程嘅進度同埋所面對嘅挑戰。

327
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:15,180
統對香港嘅未來發展十分重要，而特區政府會繼續支持香港機場管理局按計劃推展三跑道系統項目。機管局已於二零一八年順利展開三跑道系統工程，首階段主要進行六百五十公頃嘅填海工程。

328
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:58,580
千四百萬人次，貨運量超過五百一十萬公噸，航班數目更加係超過四十二萬架次，三項均為新年度嘅紀錄，更連續九年成為全球最繁忙嘅貨運機場。為咗應付長遠持續增長嘅航空交通量，及維持香港得嚟不易嘅航空物流交通樞紐地位，三跑道係。

329
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:51,280
根據機管局嘅估算，三跑道系統嘅建造成本按付款當日價格計算，約為港幣一千四百一十五億元。根據機管局提供嘅資料，機管局已批出嘅主要合約總值大約係四百八十億元，位置喺預算之內，並繼續喺已喺預算一千四百一十五億元。

330
01:14:51,280 --> 01:15:11,290
內完成整項三跑道系統項目為目標。財務方面，基金局按所建議嘅融資方案，喺今年二月成功發行，為期十年嘅五月五億美元債券，反應熱烈。而基金管局正計劃喺二零一九至二零二零年度發行五十億元。

331
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:31,300
五十億港元三年期嘅零售債券有關個項融資方案嘅最新進展，機管局嘅同事稍後亦會為各位委誒委員作出介紹。鑑於三跑道系統嘅項目嘅規模、成本同埋複雜程度，公眾期望政府密切監察機管局落實該項目嘅工作同埋進度。

332
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:51,310
我哋十分明白，議員及社會大眾喺呢方面嘅關注，亦認同三跑道系統嘅推展需要受到社會同埋立法會嘅監察，並聽取各持份者嘅意見。我哋會繼續定期向立法會同埋各位議員匯報三跑道系統嘅最新進展，並聽取議員嘅意見。主席，我而家又請機管局。

333
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:26,690
The progress of the works, main as you see on this slide here, the reclamation works comprise many items, comprising seawall, which is progressing very well. As you can see, we now have forty-six percent of the seawall around the perimeter is up above sea level, which allows us to fill behind it. This

334
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,160
嗯。

335
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,560
我 just hand over to my colleague now. Take you through the environmental aspects.

336
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:54,740
This is another area of reclamation fill on the runway. So we continue to fill in all the areas. What we are doing is prioritising the critical areas for the follow-on works.

337
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:52,330
shows the the phasing that we intend. Obviously, you'll appreciate that it was never our intention to complete all of the reclamation before we carried on the follow-on works, and so we are.

338
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:10,090
你可見喺右邊嗰度，係最上層嘅樓層，係已經完成嘅。

339
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:23,410
你會見到那係現在高過海平面，而且實際上沉降在最終水平是正在進行。所以我們有信心把那區交給我們，以及後續的區，讓我們能夠按時完成這個計劃。

340
01:18:50,880 --> 01:19:08,120
which is on the original programme. That green area, if I just show you some photographs, which might be helpful to members, you'll see there that is that green area or a large part of that green area. That's the first phased area that we have to hand over in the third quarter of this year.

341
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:50,600
Our date of 2022, following this phasing plan. The big area you'll see, the first area which we intended always to hand over this year is the green area. In fact, we will start handing over that in phases. The green area, starting in the third quarter of this year.

342
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:55,990
Members may remember we're using a technique for the first time in Hong Kong deep cement mixing. It has been very effective. I'm pleased to report that we now have 92% of that DCM complete. The small amount that still remains to be done is actually adjacent and very close to the runway, the existing runway.

343
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:19,800
The last part of the reclamation process is the filling itself. Now, members will note in the paper we've identified, as we did last November in our update, that there have been some delays to the filling operation. As of now, those delays have continued.

344
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:39,810
And we are now 18 weeks behind on the filling operation. This is different from being behind on the entire programme. We have a number of measures which we're doing with our contractor to mitigate these delays. Primarily, this phasing plan here, which members will have an annex to their paper.

345
01:17:52,640 --> 01:18:12,650
conducting a phasing operation, very large areas. The dotted red line around the perimeter of the north runway, you'll see at the top of the the diagram, is the primary area. And for two thousand and twenty two, we need to complete that area as well as the the T, the bottom part leading down to the to the

346
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:32,660
existing island, and you'll see there the phasing for the handover to our reclamation to our follow-on contractor. The follow-on contractor has already been appointed on programme, and the phasing that we intend here takes cognisance of the delays we have to date, and we will still achieve.

347
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:43,800
This is another view of that same area from the north. Looking, you'll see in the foreground is the seawall for the north runway, and that area is in the middle ground, showing substantial area ready or soon be ready to hand over to our contractor. And you can see the existing airport, the lights in the background.

348
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,780
環境嗰個業資源嘅。

349
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:22,550
個計劃咧，可以幫助到啲漁民咧，有機會即係轉型，或者做其他漁業以外嘅行業嘅。

350
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:33,030
係希望有九千至一萬二條嘅噉，亦都係投放喺我哋南跑道嘅西邊嘅位置，一個誒海事禁區嘅位置啦。

351
01:23:53,530 --> 01:24:02,100
個中華白海豚嘅保育區嘅位置嘅，咁變咗從連接呢個幾個保育區咧，希望可以提升到對中華白海豚嘅保育嗰個誒效果嘅。

352
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:13,760
咁跟住落嚟一個誒好簡單嘅縮時影片，有誒分零鐘，咁希望可以大家瞭解。誒，我我我我諗呢個唔好做啦。O K，好嘛，因為冇乜時間。咁或者我最後有幾張幻燈片交畀羅先生。

353
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:16,120
Of course, there are a number of other elements of a project this size, and there's extensive change to Terminal Two. And so you see here the Terminal Two area on the existing island. These works are well advanced now. You'll see in the left and right areas that we're we're constructing outside.

354
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:36,130
The footprint of the current terminal two, we're able to do that, and by the end of this year, those works will be sufficiently advanced that we will then close terminal two to allow us for the extensive modifications work that's necessary for that. In the bottom of the picture, you'll see two pictures, one.

355
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:56,140
On the left, you'll see the picture of what's the APM depot, which is to the the east or to the bottom of T2. This is a large depot, a very very large underground construction for to allow us for the APM being the automated people mover systems. That depot has now been the structure has now been

356
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:37,220
誒，thank you，Kelvin。誒咁跟住嚟咧，就為同大家誒報告翻我哋環境方面嘅事事啦。咁誒自三跑工程開始期間咧，其實我哋都嚴格執行我哋嘅環境監察同審查嘅工作啦，確保我哋嘅承建商咧都執行曬所有應該做嘅誒緩解措施。咁但係除此之外咧，其實我哋亦都就住誒我哋之前承諾。

357
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:57,230
咗會提升呢個海洋生態同埋漁業資源嘅工作咧，我哋做咗係列嘅工作，包括喺二零一六年底咧，機管局係注資咗四億元，就成立咗一個海改善海洋生態基金啦，同埋一個漁業提升基金嘅。咁喺過往呢兩年咧，呢個基金分別係已經誒批出咗誒超過一千八百萬，係支援咗有十六個項目嘅。

358
01:21:57,230 --> 01:22:17,240
咁譬如喺嗰次可能生態方面咧，我哋就支持咗有兩個嘅項目啦，分別係喺珠江口嘅伶仃洋啦，同埋一個珠江口滘西嘅位置咧，做翻一個中華白海豚嘅調查，即係從而咧可以掌握到多啲關於白海豚嘅資訊啦。咁另外一個譬如喺漁業方面，我哋亦都支持咗一個誒珍珠養殖嘅試驗計劃啦。咁亦都希望就住咧。

359
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:43,030
咁除除咗呢個誒兩個基金之外，其實機管局亦都自己自發一啲資助同埋管理一啲海改善海洋生態嘅提升嘅措施啦。當中包括咗我哋有一個改善生誒環境生態嘅海堤設計啦。咁喺我哋嚟緊新嘅填海區入邊一個大約十三公里長嘅新海堤入邊咧，我哋會選擇一啲。

360
01:22:43,030 --> 01:23:03,040
適當嘅海堤嘅位置咧，做啲啲誒誒幻燈片上面睇到嘅一啲即係誒環保嘅海堤設計。噉啊，海堤嘅設計嘅好處係咩咧？佢其實佢就提供一啲比較粗造啲，同埋有啲坑紋嘅表面咧，希望可以即係藉此咧就提升呢個微生物嘅生長，就提升呢個生物多樣多樣性，從而咧亦都希望有望可以提升當地嘅。

361
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:25,530
咁另外一個措施咧，就係我哋誒亦都計劃係做一個投放魚苗嘅先導計劃啦。噉我哋嚟緊希望李生，你簡單啲，因為好多委員排緊隊問，要簡單啲，盡快。噉我哋呢個投放魚苗咧，就希望喺下個月去進行啦。咁亦都誒誒諮詢咗漁民嘅意見啦。噉我哋嚟緊會放，譬如三種唔同嘅魚啦，咁亦都係。

362
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:53,530
咁最後啦，其實另一個比較重要啲嘅誒，我哋個緩解措施咧，就係我哋誒喺三跑全面運作二零二四年嘅時候咧，我哋誒希望成成立一個三跑六個海岸公園，咁個面積大約係二千四百公頃啦。咁成立咗之後咧，就希望可以連接到現有嘅沙洲龍虎洲海岸公園啦、大小無都海岸公園啦，同埋珠江口嘅一

363
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,300
嗯。

364
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,180
As I said, we we could.

365
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,120
Hi, Kevin.

366
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,890
至今為止，一粒海沙都未有。

367
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,550
好，誒邊位回答？

368
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:25,820
And we do not envisage any cost overrun at this stage.

369
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:59,470
知幾多？而最重要嘅就係究竟原定嗰個員工日期啦，會唔會受住而家呢個情況之下有所影響？陳主席。

370
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:31,480
呢個嘅三跑道嘅項目，亦都讓佢哋可以分享我哋基本局嘅成果。咁多謝主席。O.K.，唔該，羅生。嗱，而家就有九位議員誒撳咗掣，咁如果大家唔再撳掣，我就喺度畫線啦。咁第一位就係抗進議、抗進議員跟住陳振英議員。

371
01:27:43,140 --> 01:28:01,780
We have a contract with the contractor for which he is responsible for sourcing those materials. So it is not intended that we would pay more money than our contract allows, applying the terms of the contract. So he is responsible for sourcing those materials. As to the delay.

372
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:34,160
我盡快解釋，多謝主席各位議員。誒，我哋嘅詳細嘅嗰個嘅融資方案咧，其實係以前同立法會介紹過，亦都喺公眾嘅記錄裏邊。裏邊大致上講咧，就係我哋會透過債券同埋透過銀行貸款咧去融資，最多不啊最高不多於六百九十億嘅一個嘅總嘅融資額。咁咧就。

373
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:54,170
誒喺裏邊咧分開，即係誒短期同埋中長期。喺短期裏邊，如果大家睇個圖嘅時候咧，其實咧你會發覺我哋其實有一個嘅項目已經做咗，而一個項目正係籌備，將會進行。做咗嗰個咧就係一個嘅十年期嘅一個嘅美金嘅一個債券，喺今年二月嘅時候做嘅。咁而即將籌備嗰個咧啊，就係我哋係啊一個五十億。

374
01:24:54,170 --> 01:25:14,180
億嘅一個嘅港幣嘅零售債券，咁咧就我哋喺二月份做嗰個嘅誒嘅債券嗰個嘅發行咧，其實就係誒二月十三號，噉啊，我哋發行五億美金，咁咧就但係我哋認購嘅總額咧，啊，從機構投資者嚟嘅認購總額係三十六億美元，咁即係話咧係七倍嘅認購嘅，噉啊。

375
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:34,190
誒誒，嗰個嘅票面利率咧係三點四五釐，喺當時嚟講係一個極優惠嘅一個嘅利率嚟嘅。噉啊，呢個係誒同我哋嘅機構嘅評級、信貸評級誒Double A Plus係一模一樣嘅。噉啊，呢個嘅反映到即係金融界對我哋嗰個三跑同埋對基金局嘅信心。噉我哋亦都即係誒誒對我哋。

376
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:54,200
以後做融資嘅時候，更加帶嚟鼓舞。我哋而家籌備緊嘅係一個嘅啊零售債券嘅一個項目。咁咧就誒，我哋會係大概係三年期，噉我哋嘅發行額會係五十億港元嘅。噉我哋希望咧係讓咧公眾香港公眾只要有香港身份證嘅時候嘅市民咧就可以去認投。噉我哋。

377
01:25:54,200 --> 01:26:14,210
係誒，希望咧係啊，每一個嘅申請本金，即係話每一手咧係大概一萬元港幣噉啊。誒，想亦都希望係喺誒香港聯交所誒誒上市嘅。噉啊，我哋希望呢一個咧就會喺誒二零一九年或者二零二零年裏邊嘅時候進行。噉我哋希望咧能夠更加多能夠讓市民去參與啊。

378
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:51,770
好啊！多謝主席。因為咧啊，呢個嘅三跑填海咧，並且個社會係非常之關注。我好想問咧，首先係到而家為止係咪真係一粒海沙都未有？而家就話啦，預計咧就話嗰個嘅啊，鹽漬咧都已經差唔多係十八個星期㗎啦。呢個鹽漬究竟有冇啊，令到佢超支超支？

379
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:23,130
Yes, perhaps I can answer. It was always the intention for the reclamation to source materials from a number of sources. The member has mentioned marine sand. We continue to, or our contractor who is responsible for obtaining all of the materials, continues to source materials from a number of sources.

380
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:43,140
Including looking for marine sand. Primarily, he's using manufactured sand at the moment, supplemented by sand from overseas. Whilst he continues to source materials from other sources, he's we are hopeful that we will be shortly sourcing sand from Guangxi. So those materials are coming.

381
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:22,070
The delays on the fill process only—that's an important part of the reclamation—but we are mindful that, as I've explained with that phasing diagram, we will still achieve our deadline of the opening the runway in two thousand and twenty-two and completing the three RS in two thousand and twenty-four.

382
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,700
Northern Runway.

383
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:40,780
三千四。

384
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,630
唔可以保證。

385
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,770
呢個三跑填海工程有所超支，就咁簡單啫。

386
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:28,310
循環貸款咧，我想問下，而家係咪已經開始誒用緊啦？咁呢呢度幾個問題，唔該主席。好，邊位回應？

387
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:18,180
As I say, we're pushing our contractor very hard to comply with this contract. We do not foresee that we will. We will. We are confident of achieving our programme by 2022, and we do not foresee any cost overrun.

388
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:46,220
可可唔可以喺呢度能夠有個保證？首先保證唔超支啦，同埋保證到喺個原定日期前完工。因為聽落去咧就話我哋而家有幾方面咧就能夠即係採購呢個海沙，但係呢個畀人感覺都好似好唔穩陣喎。因為而家你哋已經喺個文件上面都話滯後十八個星期啦，而後頭先都未答到我問題，係咪資？

389
01:28:56,730 --> 01:29:16,740
We we continue to take we have a considerable amount of sand has been already placed in the reclamation as those pictures showed. We we continue to source those materials through our contractor. We continue to push him very hard to cover to catch up those eighteen weeks. But notwithstanding that, because

390
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:36,750
Because of the phasing, we are we're phasing the works to prioritise those areas necessary to hand over to our contractors for the construction of the runway itself. As I said, we're we believe we're on programme to do that, and we do not see any cost overrun, and we are confident of achieving our programme by two thousand and twenty-two to open the.

391
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:58,080
我針對嘅係延遲咗十八個星期嗰個供應商啦，即係而家頭頭先所講嘅就係誒你哋而家傾緊嗰度，而家都仲係拗緊，好快就十九個星期、二十個星期嘅主席。而家我問個問題就係話你睇唔到即係，既然係噉，可唔可以喺你度保證唔會因為呢延十八個星期或以上嘅時間係引致？

392
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:39,450
我誒，我我明白，因為個超支唔係預期，當然我哋當然好明白啦。但係個問題在於，而家我哋嘅擔憂就係我哋見得到咧，好快可能又到下一次回報，點知都仲未有就係我講緊主要而家同你哋爭緊你哋海砂嘅供應商，你哋有冇信心可以有一個日期內係可以問佢攞到你哋應該要攞到嘅海？

393
01:30:41,130 --> 01:31:01,140
Can you briefly answer? Yes, we are confident that the contractor will be able to achieve what he's required to do. Okay，陳俊英議員跟住譚文豪議員。誒唔該主席。誒海沙嗰度咧，我想跟進一個問題，因為我知道咧，佢話延遲咗之後咧，就除咗內地沙源就會。

394
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:21,150
誒向菲律賓同埋馬來西亞嘅唔同沙源度採購沙粒啦。噉我想問下誒呢個非內地沙源嗰個供應咧，你哋諗住係佔總體嘅供應量有冇一個百分比？心目中有個比例嘅咁呢個簡單嘅跟進。第二個咧就係誒喺文件第十七都點都講到咧，二號客運。

395
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:41,160
大樓就今年第四季度就暫停運作，進行誒主題工程嘅改建啦。噉就話可行嘅情況之下咧，改建工程產生嗰啲拆建物料咧，就盡可能用翻喺三跑呢個系統裏邊。噉我想問呢啲拆建物料咧，會用喺邊方面嘅工程？其實係幾多要重用？你哋係咪已經有計劃同埋呢個？

396
01:31:41,160 --> 01:32:01,170
喺你嘅成本上邊，應該係咪扣除咗即係二號客運大樓拆咗，可以慳翻一部分嘅成本咧？噉樣最後一個問題就頭先嗰個零售債券嗰度啦。我見誒誒都介紹咗下佢個計劃，但係咧就淨係講話係固定利率。咁頭先都講啊，機構投資者嗰邊咧就。

397
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:21,180
誒係三點四五釐啦。噉我唔知你對呢個固定利率咧有冇一個，因為我估計咧，我哋誒市民大眾都幾有興趣去即係認購呢個誒債券嘅。咁嗰個利率你有冇一個諗法咧？咁誒，即係譬如稍高啊，定係差唔多咧？咁第二個咧就係話個一百億嘅備用銀行誒。

398
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:30,390
六分。

399
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,520
嗯。

400
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:33,330
係，即係唔係？

401
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:54,690
或committing to use as much public fill as we possibly can from the fill banks, we are taking material from Chun Kwan O and from Tuen Mun.

402
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:42,880
菲律賓和馬來西亞，當 moment，我 pass on to my colleague to talk about Timor Two。誒好啦，阿譚文豪議員，跟住田北神議員。

403
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:26,780
舊年開始嘅年中咧，應該已經開始運送呢啲海沙嚟香港啦。去到而家呢一刻，係咪一粒大陸海沙都未收到？

404
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:57,600
唔該，主席嗱，本身呢一個嘅填海工程咧，就要用一億立方米嘅海沙。其實由我未做立法會議員到我做立法會議員三跑工作小組，我一直都喺度講緊海沙呢一個問題係不容輕視。

405
01:33:49,170 --> 01:34:05,430
其實講真，我哋亦都到今天，亦都未係籌組到，未係去到要籌組一百億嘅階段嘅。噉我哋而家係暫時有五十億，噉我哋往後我哋會再再繼續籌組去一百億。咁但係絕對絕對係未到應用嘅階段。主席。哦，噉啊。

406
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:16,410
有關當局啦、機管局啦，不斷就話啊冇問題㗎啦，我哋已經定咗價買到足夠嘅海沙，仲話好開心添。對於呢一個嘅海沙價格，結果而家咧，頭先咧，阿鄺俊宇議員問得唔好，因為咧，而家我要問嘅你嘅問題就係本身你嘅海沙咧，就應該喺廣東省送嚟嘅，就或者係大陸送嚟嘅。

407
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:49,140
係咪啊，羅生啊？好啊，咁誒，主席，噉我先回應第三個問題啦。第三問題關於咧嗰個嘅誒利率問題啊，利率嘅嗰個嘅釐定咧，誒呢個咧其實喺現現階段我哋籌備嘅階誒嘅過程當中嘅時候咧，我哋稍為言之過早，我哋未去到嗰個階段，但係可以一般性咁講。

408
01:32:49,140 --> 01:33:09,150
零售債券咧，因為咧嗰個零售嘅投資者，即係一般市民咧，佢哋對風險嘅嗰個嘅承擔力咧，係相對上係誒低啲嘅，因為佢哋缺乏好多工具對沖啊之類。咁所以咧，我哋咧估計咧就係咧，我哋零售債券個息率咧應該比機構投資誒嘅嘅嘅嘅債券咧應該係稍高。咁但係究竟？

409
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:29,160
首高係幾多咧？我今天真係唔能夠答到。我哋亦都喺後往後嘅時候，我哋要同我哋嘅啊聯席嘅啊牽牽頭嘅銀行，我哋會去商討。咁亦都要睇好多市場嘅因素，譬如話即係利率嘅走勢啊，各方面。咁所以呢個係第一個答案。第二個答案就係話備用貸款嗰度咧。誒，顧名思義，備用貸款咧係當我哋其他嘅。

410
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:49,170
融資途徑都係用盡嘅時候咧，備用貸款就係一個即係啊備用嘅方式。噉我哋作為一個即係健全啊財政嘅一個嘅機構咧，我哋不斷都有備用貸款嘅。咁但係我哋誒估計，因為三跑嘅工程嘅量大，要啊一千四百幾億，咁所以我哋咧會增加到一百億嘅呢個嘅備用貸款。咁呢個。

411
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:26,840
The sand. It's always been our plan to source the fill materials for the reclamation from multiple sources. Our contractor for the reclamation is responsible for sourcing those materials, and to fulfil his contractual obligations, he continues to source those materials.

412
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:46,850
from different provinces of the mainland, overseas and locally. The principal sources of sand material at the moment is manufactured sand from Guangdong and also from Fujian province. He continues to pursue those. We are also using.

413
01:34:54,970 --> 01:35:14,980
We're also the contractor is also pursuing materials from other overseas and mainland sources. We anticipate, or the contractor anticipates that we may have sand just after the mid-year coming from Guanzhong. They are through their process now, or well advanced in their process.

414
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,640
多謝主席。

415
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,300
要鮑魚啊嘛！

416
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,880
你用多咗幾多錢？

417
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,560
嘅地方用咗DCM。

418
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,850
但係咧，就絕口唔提時間表。

419
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,560
誒，邊位回應用咗用多咗幾多錢？

420
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,450
你 pay more？ How much extra did you pay for the extra DCM？

421
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:11,560
或helps with the construction of those. Well, can you answer my questions? I don't need to know all that. How much?

422
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:14,020
機管局喺二月廿五號發表聲明，話填料方面承建商按合約要求負責乜乜乜乜乜乜，佢已經確定咧，目前掌握嘅砂源咧可以供應誒呢個三跑誒運運啦嚇。

423
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:57,670
冇嘛？你書面答翻。第二，第二就係因為供應唔到海砂而導致到呢種滯後或者做多咗D.C.M嘅喺呢部分，你會唔會追翻中交建即係本身供應海砂嘅contractor追翻佢個成本？Can you give us the information later? Okay。阿田北辰議員，跟住阿姚思榮議員。

424
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:35,730
What I'm saying is that the the costs of the DCM are are also in terms of benefits in terms of. I don't need to know the other benefits. Of course, all the all the good reason why you got the DCM. But the point is, without without being lack of the marine sands, then you do not require the extra DCM.

425
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:34,990
Of securing the necessary mainland approvals to export sand to us, and Guangdong is continuing with their own process. And we are in the interim, the contractor is we are encouraging our contractor to diversify as much as possible and sourcing materials from Southeast Asia. That includes both.

426
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:54,030
piece of sand，唔得，如果我們講marine sand，那係正確。We are we are sourcing material。Okay， that took out that should sand。Take out即係話其實大陸應承咗話會交嘅海沙一粒都交唔到。而家你哋做嘅補嘅方法係點咧？就用D C M，即係深層水泥拌合法，做多啲呢一個個。

427
01:36:54,030 --> 01:37:14,040
落水泥嘅方法嚟到追翻個工程嘅進度，你而家已經係滯後咗十八個星期㗎啦。你用呢一個嘅DCM嘅方法，梗係好啦，只不過個問題係變咗貴啊嘛。我正想問你，你而家用多咗，比原本設計多咗。

428
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:44,920
同埋會唔會影響嗰個實際嗰個成本？So, if I can clarify, members, correct, we we are having increased in the amount of DCM. If you recall, DCM is a technique that has not been used in Hong Kong before. It's been used a lot around the world. I'm very pleased through our supply chain that we able to establish.

429
01:37:44,920 --> 01:38:04,930
some very very reliable contractors to deliver the DCM very successfully. So we have taken the opportunity to have some more DCM in areas where it benefits the follow-on works. So in terms of where we're constructing, the it is beneficial to us in a number of ways to have DCM. It improves

430
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:56,020
No, my question is, how much did you pay for this extra volume of the DCM? I'm trying to explain that the. Well, you don't need to explain. I need to number. Well, I need I need a dollar sign. How much? Okay, the extra DCM is not solely to reduce the amount of sand, although that has it has resulted in reduction of sand. It has also resulted in a number.

431
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:16,030
主席啊，我覺得完全嘥緊我時間。我用咗成分鐘畀你慢慢喺度講㗎啦，已經。唔係，噉你畀佢答埋先啦。唔係佢不斷講畀我聽D.C.M.其他benefit，我梗係知其他benefit啦。但係問題就係話，如果你唔係因為唔夠海沙，你焗住變咗用多咗D.C.M.嘅話，根本上唔需要做啊嘛。即係等於食一餐飯，我個知食鮑魚好啦，但係明明我唔係。

432
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:39,030
咁有冇影響嗰個嗰個實際成本？Does that affect the actual誒cost or or budget？I I don't have the cost with me. As I say, it is not just a simple add-on.嗱，你而家你而家冇冇冇冇冇數字。第一，我唔信你去到而家同我講話冇唔知道幾多錢。呢個要求你書面答翻。你話你而家。

433
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:50,520
嗯。

434
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,280
二月上半月暫停。

435
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,810
啊！噉啊，問佢，佢話冇事。

436
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:45,960
二月廿五號出個公佈，提都唔提。

437
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,560
而家立法會文員寫一段就話啦。

438
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:33,450
噉啊！今次立法會文件咧，我一睇就跌咗落地。

439
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:05,650
咁即係其中，就滯留咗十四個禮拜啦，十八個禮拜啦。

440
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:20,230
我重點係有冇人隱瞞事實？

441
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:48,280
定係，你really don't know what's going on in another department.

442
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:43,830
我想問下，阿Mr. Po，你係刻意隱瞞呢？

443
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:39,580
因為到時我已經當時我已經聽到好多傳言咧，話嗰啲供應停咗。

444
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:29,320
你嚟得立法會，當時滿天飛嘅啦，謠言話啲供應冇咗，斷咗。

445
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:38,120
你哋竟然作過公開聲明，提都唔提呢件事。今日就話二月初已經冇供應，二月底出份報告，提都唔提。

446
01:40:52,640 --> 01:41:01,500
咁咧就要遲十八個禮拜先至揾到廣西嘅海沙去繼續接住。

447
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:15,930
噉我所知道咧，佢哋可以喺其他地方個工程做住先，就成個工程唔會拖延十八個禮拜。但係呢個唔係我重點。

448
01:40:18,130 --> 01:40:29,380
年當月月初已經開始冇收到內地飼料，即係廣東嗰啲機砂嘅供應，一個咁重要嘅事實都冚住。

449
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,550
Kevin。

450
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:22,930
啊，卑偉會議。

451
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:20,340
唔清唔楚，都唔知點睇你份文件。

452
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:50,040
喂，副局長，你解釋下呢份文件講咩㗎？副局。

453
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:09,090
東基沙有簽合約，如果佢交唔足貨，你可唔可以告佢㗎？可唔可以要求賠償啊？

454
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:16,810
左一兩個禮拜嘅啫，跟住就收緊啦。咁既然係噉，點解會滯後十八個禮拜咧？

455
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:17,290
好簡單一問噉啊，跟住姚思榮議員，可唔可以答埋呢個問題？誒，由阿Kevin，可唔可以要求賠償啊？

456
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:45,110
二月初停咗，到而家都未有，要等到誒廣西嗰啲沙六月嚟。佢而家話原來二月初暫停係因為農歷新年喎，呢份文件咁寫嚟立法會咪好誤導。

457
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:56,250
responsibility to deliver the materials in accordance with the programme, and we continue to push him very hard. A to achieve. So, will you claim them for loss in terms of reduction? We will apply the contract which has the normal contract provisions. Okay, so you will. All right, good. Okay,葉志榮議員跟住就係胡志偉議員。

458
01:41:52,460 --> 01:42:12,470
I can clarify quite clearly. It was not our intention to conceal any fact. So why was it not mentioned? The fact is that the timetable hasn't changed. Our timetable remains. No, my question is why was the stoppage not mentioned? Perhaps I can clarify that. The the stoppage was anticipated over Chinese New Year.

459
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:32,480
作為你話，

460
01:42:50,760 --> 01:43:10,770
多謝田北辰議員嘅提問啦。其實十一段咧，主要係解釋翻咧喺二月初暫停咧，係因為農歷新年嗰個年假嘅關係咧，令到內地有啲工作咧係暫停嘅。好，副局長，我想問你，咁呢個過年停咗嘅嘢，而家所謂嗰啲廣東嘅機沙啊，係咪而家已經日日收緊㗎？冇錯，即係停。

461
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:43,850
啊，其實咧就嗰個十八個禮拜咧係嗱，我哋舊年十一月咧就有份誒誒information paper就話滯後係幾個禮拜嘅。咁跟住其實係一路落去咧，誒一路呢幾個月咧都係嗰個沙嘅量或者填料嘅量係咪係好足夠？咁所以係誒一路係由。

462
01:43:43,850 --> 01:44:03,860
即係誒開工到依家，嗱，即係話一路係唔足夠，但係就冇停到，係冇停到嘅。嗰個機沙咧就只係可能我哋文件咁唔該，你以後啲文件寫清楚啲啦。嚇，冇問題，冇問題，係嘛？我哋只係嗰個農歷新年嗰段時間係暫停個機沙。咁邊個需要負責咧？阿主席唔好意思，我想問下，你哋唔係同廣

463
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:38,500
perhaps I can clarify the the we have a main contractor who's responsible for both sourcing and placing the fill materials that includes the manufactured sand from Guangdong I apologise the paper was not perhaps clear enough it did stop for an extended period in February the sand has now coming further coming back from Guangdong it is the contractor's

464
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:16,540
多謝主席。誒就有關嗰個財務安排嘅咁誒，今次文件主又講個融資啦。咁但係其他兩部分，一個就係政府個誒唔需要上繳嘅利潤呢部分咧，就冇介紹到嘅。咁另外就係機場建設費個收入嗰度咧。噉我我想第一個問題就係問咧，即係。

465
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:02,380
係。

466
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,250
嗯，呢位回應。

467
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:05,260
信心除咗三跑之外，頭先我所講嗰幾個項目，你哋都可以誒做到預期嗰個誒，即係建成嘅目標咧噉樣。

468
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:06,460
誒機場口岸島，唔係唔係呢個廣州誒呢個口岸誒島方面都係由誒機誒你哋機管嗰方面負責，可能策劃嘅噉樣。

469
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:59,270
即係誒其他，即係話誒，譬如中轉大樓啊，或者係呢個誒博覽館二期呢方面，係咪你哋呢個部分負責嘅，還是係其他部門負責嘅？

470
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:36,410
所以咧喺嗰個嘅最終嗰個借貸嘅六百九個億裏邊咧，其實已經係減先減除咗呢啲嘅項目，咁所以咧六百九個億咧仍然係一個誒可行同埋穩健嘅一個嘅融資方案嚟。

471
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:16,450
因為會話或者我補充一句誒，我哋喺公司嘅內部結構上面係分得好清楚嘅，三跑嘅工程同埋非三跑工程，非三跑工程係由另外一個部門負責。好清楚，胡志偉議員唔喺度啊，周浩鼎議員。

472
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:46,610
The filling operation only. The other reclamation processes are working, proceeding very well. I look together with all the other works that we will achieve opening of the third runway in two thousand and twenty-two and completion of the full third runway system in two thousand and twenty-four.

473
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:24,220
咁咁多項目，你哋有冇信心？除咗三跑之外，其他嘅基建都能夠誒同步進行，而避免因為其他嘅基建影響到誒三跑開通之後整體嗰個規劃嘅安排咧？兩個問題先。嗰個邊位回應？

474
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:36,550
誒誒呢誒正式誒唔使上繳政府嘅效益方面，同你哋原來嘅預算係誒相差幾多咧？另外機場建設費方面同樣啦，都係誒你哋當時有個預計嘅。據我所知，你哋嗰個預計收入比誒實際而家收入係高嘅。咁誒你？

475
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:56,560
你哋呢度係點樣樣去誒評估你哋整個融資安排？第二個咧就係有關誒二零二四年三炮會起動啦，但係期間咧，你哋要面臨好多嘅基建啦，包括航天城誒呢個誒中轉大樓，仲有博覽館二期，噉啊，仲有呢個。

476
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:44,590
啊！多謝多謝姚議員嘅問題。誒，第一個問題關於到咧，就係話啊，喺嗰個餘餘嘅兩個融資來源裏邊，就係政府啊啊，我哋停止派息同埋話嗰個嘅啊基建建設費嗰度咧，我想講咧就係咧喺我哋個財務模型裏邊嘅時候咧，我哋啊根據我哋手頭有嘅資料咧做出作出估。

477
01:46:44,590 --> 01:47:04,600
估算，誒喺過去呢三年裏邊咧，誒我哋嗰個現實嘅情況咧，其實係同估算嘅係相若嘅，咁所以咧，我哋覺得咧呢個咧到今天嚟講咧，我哋都係仍然係有信心，我哋呢個融資計劃咧係穩健同埋可行嘅。第二個咧就係話，關於到啊其他嘅設施，我哋誒有好多唔同嘅工程係進行，咁呢個。

478
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:24,610
咧，其實我哋當日建立我哋嘅財務模型嘅時候咧，其實我哋亦都已經咧將呢啲放咗落去嘅。譬如話，我哋而家嘅一號客運大樓嘅擴建啦，我哋四號停車場嘅擴建啦，或者我哋起一個嘅誒天際走廊啊，去連接到北衞星廊呢啲誒等等等等嘅誒嘅建設咧，其實我哋都喺模型裏邊有遇到嘅。噉。

479
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:56,700
啊！阿朱，我先問一問題，或者誒你話誒差唔多啦，咁可唔可以誒事後你補翻個文件啊？好嘛，好啊，即係即係即係呢三年嗰個財務嗰個實際情況點樣啊？咁另外就誒頭先講一個財務啦，咁另外個工程安排誒有啲係想涉及到誒基管局要負責嘅，咁呢方面你哋有冇？

480
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:20,870
唔該，主席。

481
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:20,560
好啊，邊位？

482
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:25,570
Miss Tepu.

483
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:44,140
有一個答覆嘅，好啊，唔該，誒。

484
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:04,840
So we are, we don't see oversee see any overrun either in time or in cost at this stage.

485
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:58,600
Will be done within the original estimate that we gave to this house some considerable time ago for the reclamation costs. We continue to work diligently to make sure that we contain costs.

486
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:18,970
建議等到機管局提交咗個發展方案之後咧，政府係會全面咁檢視北大嶼山機場島同埋香港口岸人工島之間嘅交通接駁需要同埋嘅設施嘅。或者而家請機管局同事咧，係解答關於第一個嘅提問。

487
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:31,120
Yes, apart from the delay to the filling operations, there's a lot of other aspects and activities which continue in parallel, and I'm very pleased to report those are making very good progress. Even some of those are actually ahead of programme. So that is why we are confident that, notwithstanding a delay to.

488
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:41,160
啊，就兩個問題啦。第一就係關於個海沙嘅供應嘅問題。嗱，當然我一路聽或者睇個文件就講就話咧，而家嗰個沙源嘅海沙嘅沙源供應係有所拓闊嘅。咁但係咧，我就想問一個好重點嘅問題咧，就係話，由於始終今次係發生過。

489
01:49:41,160 --> 01:50:01,170
和啊，供應上有疑誤啦。噉啊，雖然我聽到你哋講話會追得翻個時間冇影響，但係我比較關心咧就係由於呢種疑誤嘅出現，你哋而家嘅評估對於個最後個總成本會唔會構成影響？因為市民最關心咧就係。

490
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:21,180
話而家你一旦出現過任何嘅疑誤，噉你可能就因為咁咧，有機會衍生到一啲成本嘅增加。咁成本增加就可能會又會超出咗你哋原來嗰個開支預算。噉我諗啊，市民係關心呢樣嘢，所以你哋可唔可以畀個明確嘅答案我？喺而家呢個目前嘅評估，對於嗰個整體。

491
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:41,190
啲嘅成本嘅控制，同你哋本來預期嗰個整個融資嘅誒開支嚟講，已經有冇一啲嘅情況出現，會係超支嘅？你哋你哋點樣評估呢樣嘢？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題咧，我想提咧，就係因為我留意到你哋文件都講咧，繼續係維持二二年咧，就三跑應該係完成嘅。

492
01:50:41,320 --> 01:51:01,330
噉我過去咧一路咧都提啦，因為三跑嘅完成就明明係可以帶嚟好大量嘅就業機會，直接嘅就業機會可能講緊係十四萬。咁而家我就想問咧，喺而家嘅東湧往來，你哋機場由東湧往來機場咧，就靠嗰啲巴士兜來兜去啫，六路交通。

493
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:21,340
咁但係呢個我相信就唔能夠應付未來再加多十幾萬嘅就業人口，因為嗰啲就業人口你都想佢能夠做到園區就業。咁如果你要做到真正嘅園區就業咧，你應該畀佢有集體運輸。簡單講咧，就係政府其實而家究竟對於過去我哋曾經。

494
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:41,350
提過，亦都有報告係畀咗政府講係究竟東湧線係咪可以延長，係可以延到去呢個機場站，作為一個集體運輸去處理未來嗰個就業人口嘅安排。究竟呢件事而家政府當局或者堅股谷，你哋究竟嘅定案係點？因為登咗好耐都未。

495
01:51:45,740 --> 01:52:05,750
啊，主席副局，或者我首先解答啊，周議員第二個個關於機場去東中個交通個問題先，跟住咧請機管嘅同事咧去解答關於海沙同埋個成本個問題。咁其實政府咧已經係邀請咗機管局咧就香港誒整個港珠大橋香港口岸人工島嘅發展咧提交咗一個發展嘅。

496
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:46,110
Okay, if I can answer regarding your your concern of additional cost, quite understand. Notwithstanding that delay, we are very confident that we will not incur additional cost above the budget of one four one five. We've talked about the fact that we've taken on certain measures, including additional DCM. We're still confident that those work.

497
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:07,190
哦，阿阿主席。

498
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,370
I'm sorry. No translation on that.

499
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:56,590
That's a target, and we will certainly try and use as much feathers we possibly can in the future.

500
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:10,520
precisely to allow us to reduce the fine contents in that material, so it can be used underwater. So we've actually commenced early using our

501
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:41,200
噉啊，胡志威議員，戴主席，我誒希望咧，機管局咧係可以將而家嗰個成本開支嘅狀態咧，係有具體文件交上嚟，因為過往咧，誒，我哋每一次喺呢啲大型工程嘅討論咧，

502
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:19,150
埋個比例會係點樣樣，而令到即係我哋信任咧，嗰個工程嘅推展咧係會如期完成。好啊，邊位啊？係咪阿羅生可以講下嗰個文件可以交，係咪可以確認呢一點啊？啊，可以交文件，關於你哋嗰個誒成本控制個。

503
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:27,480
sorry，我我每一句追好，跟住嚟嚟咗十嗱嗰個嗰好簡單啫。嗱嗰個誒成本嗰度控制，當然而家你哋誒答案係咁啦。但係我哋都係敦促你哋真係要做好，唔好到時又真係出現有其他超支啦。翻翻去頭先嗰個港鐵嗰個問題，冇冇冇得翻啦，冇得翻。噉啊，仲有四位議員排緊隊，所以我要延遲十五分鐘。OK。

504
01:53:41,530 --> 01:54:01,540
未爆煲之前個講法都係話，我哋係會係喺個budget之內咧，係做好件事嘅。噉我想睇到第一有冇個mouse通喺呢個過程裏邊，每一個mouse通而家所involve嘅cost嘅狀態點樣樣，你點樣能夠係確認畀我哋聽，即係你嗰個成本嘅控制咧係能夠within budget。噉我想係。

505
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:21,550
個文件嘅可唔可以啊？呢個嗱，第二個想問翻嘅就係呢個其實喺文件嘅第八段有提到，就係即係三跑系統咧就會啊逐步逐步咧係去用更多嘅公眾填料作為佢係填即係填土嘅一個誒來源嘅。噉我想問下。

506
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:41,560
就係誒，可唔可以講講呢一部分嘅係填土來源咧？其實會係大概係用幾多度咧？第一、第二就係因為你要填嘅係一個誒相當大面積嘅人工島，一千四百公頃嘅人工島嚟嘅。咁因為噉樣樣嘅話咧，如果按照現時我哋喺填料庫上面一得。

507
01:54:41,560 --> 01:55:01,570
一千五百萬公噸嘅填料嘅話咧，其實個距離你能夠運用到佢去完成工作嘅需要咧，係好遠好遠水路嘅。咁所以想亦都問下就係話，你另外嘅填料咧，可能係要頭先你用D C M啦，亦都用咗呢一個基沙嘅，可唔可以講一講呢幾範加加萬？

508
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:41,140
I will answer the question on on public fill, perhaps. Thank you for the question. You're correct. We are trying to use as much public fill as we can, recognising that the fill banks are are getting full in Chuenkwano. This is resulting our contractor building sortation lines actually at the the fill banks. We.

509
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:44,640
係。

510
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:23,950
係啊，李生。

511
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:14,440
好關心嗰個沙嘅問題，但係。

512
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:31,670
都引述翻二月嘅報紙嘅報導啊！

513
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:47,440
咁第三就係你而家文件裏面咧，淨係講到咧。

514
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:52,020
係唔該，主席。誒，我有三個問題嘅。第一個問題咧，就係。

515
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:09,140
約填料嗰部分嘅九十二億元咧，係完成到嘅。咁即係話。

516
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:18,940
有一個可能性，就係有啲消息人士講啦，就唔止九啊二億㗎，噉我都唔知幾多錢。噉你可唔可以回應下呢一個誒報道？

517
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:41,480
報紙報道係咩咧？就係話三跑填海工程咧，有消息人士講，就已經咧落後咗半年啦。

518
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:27,730
睇到呢份文件咧，第一其實而家市民都唔知道到底你幾三跑，個個都話係一億立方米嘅填料，咁到底係咪咧？咁呢個誒第一已經唔知啦。

519
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:42,970
第二咧就係到底而家你誒有啲想嘅頭先話哦已經露出水面啊噉樣，咁到底係呢個一億立方米我哋需要嘅填料，咁而家到底係有幾多係填咗落去咧？

520
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:43,560
誒，其實公眾填料咧喺我哋誒個工程入邊一路都有考慮到會使用嘅。咁其實去到誒頭先講緊咧，其實我哋而家一路都係加強緊用多啲公眾填料。其實我哋最終咧係講緊大約係一成多到係總量入邊咧係屬於公眾填料嘅。OK，張開地議員。

521
01:55:41,140 --> 01:56:01,150
Built three sortation lines at Chunquanou and one at Tunmunn to allow us to maximise the use of that fill. The original intention of our contract was to use public fill above water level, but in an effort to use more public fill, we've actually changed that, which is why the sortation plants actually sort the material more, more, more.

522
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:30,850
The public fill. The it was mentioned earlier by a member that our target was always the design was one hundred million cubic metres of fill material. Through our careful design and also by substituting areas of DCM, we have actually reduced the total fill demand.

523
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:50,860
By some twenty percent, and so we're still keen. Using public fill is an issue in terms of of the supply rate. We continue to work and push our contractor to diligently use as much public fill as we can. You mentioned our target of fifty million million tons of material.

524
01:56:57,190 --> 01:57:17,200
誒，主席唔好意思，我我想跟進呢一點，因為誒講緊用緊五十萬公唔係對唔住五千萬咧，應該係五千萬公噸嘅public fuels咧，其實係即係差唔多就要佔用緊嚟緊嘅呢幾年嘅係所有嘅公眾填料都係投入去呢個係機三跑路用，係咪噉嘅意思啊？

525
01:57:52,300 --> 01:58:12,310
其實誒機管局咧，成日叫人信佢就唔會超資同埋唔會延期咧，我哋真係聽咗太多呢啲廢話㗎啦。咁實際上咧，我哋要嘅係誒數字清楚嘅進度嗱。今日咧嗰個文件咧真係好廢啊，因為大家都～

526
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:03,300
perhaps。

527
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:20,770
第三咧就係。

528
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:24,230
都講咗好耐啦，主席，舊年咧。

529
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:28,170
其實嚟事務委會咧，我就問過佢嘅。

530
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:26,750
噉我睇到咧，政府就係誒個回應民話有五類嘅建造業要會批准嘅工程。

531
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:37,880
of materials lies both manufactured sand, public fill, and sand from Fujian and and further afield in in Southeast Asia.

532
02:00:46,610 --> 02:01:01,210
二零三五嘅規劃大綱，即係其實就係三跑餘下仲有啲項目嘅嗰啲工程嘅規模同埋佢嘅成本，要隱瞞公眾到幾時咧？三個問題，唔該。嗯，好啊，邊位回應？

533
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:46,330
到底呢個二零三五年嗰個規劃大綱去咗邊度咧？咁當時阿馮永業先生就話：哦，二零一八年底就會公佈啦。咁而家已經係二零一九年就嚟五月都嚟緊啦。噉你到底想將呢個？

534
01:58:47,720 --> 01:59:07,730
得啲來源嘅啫，就係話哦，有廣東省同福建省嘅機沙啦，有田料啦，跟住有誒內地同埋東南亞嘅沙粒資料啦。錢我都唔同你計住啦，你可唔可以講翻你每一個呢啲來源嘅量到底係幾多咧？呢個係第一方。

535
01:59:07,730 --> 01:59:27,740
方面嘅問題，第二咧就係今日呢個會咧點解會集中講沙呢個誒問題？就係因為二月嘅時候有傳媒爆料啊嘛，即係下下都要傳媒爆料。噉你哋又而家嗰個三跑小組委員會又畀人殺咗，噉啊兩個月幾之後咧先至傾，所以我有。

536
01:59:42,160 --> 02:00:02,170
咁咧，因為誒而家原本嗰啲海砂就到唔到，就要尋求其他嘅填料，包括誒頭先啊文建都提啦，係東南亞嘅填料。咁所以咧就令到咧誒成個價錢係冇可能喺嗰個合約。

537
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:25,370
Perhaps I can try and help. In terms of the different supplies, I would emphasise the airport authority has a contract with the main contractor for the reclamation. It is under that contract, he is responsible for sourcing the materials. He has sought a diversity of

538
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:58,970
That's his matter to source those materials. We continue to push him to achieve our programme. But as of today, we are still anticipate no overrun. There will be no overrun on the the time, nor on the the cost. As perhaps I mentioned, perhaps I could emphasise again.

539
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:18,980
In terms of the total material, the original members correct, and the original design, we anticipated one hundred million cubic metres of fill material. Through good design and revision, including the additional DCM, but not exclusively that, we have reduced that fill material. There's a number of advantages.

540
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:38,990
Both for the it reduces sand material, but it also means better for the follow-on works. So we've reduced the total sand demand by about twenty percent. So we continue to enforce our contract to make the contractor continue to source the materials. Regarding the the point about the media.

541
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:59,000
I would just remind members that we issued a paper, our six monthly update paper last November, where we already indicated that there was a problem with sourcing some of these fill materials, and our contractor had fallen some weeks behind. That was last November, which I think predated the the media report.

542
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:19,010
好嘅，天橋。阿陸仲豪議員，主席，可唔可以請佢？好簡單，二零三喺邊度？冇冇啊，過過過曬過曬鐘啊！你你問都問咗三三分幾鐘啊？So sorry，陸仲豪議員，唔該。哦，唔該，主席。我好直接嘅問題，一個仔人。個個都好多問題啦，個個都好多問題。我幾sorry。啊，陸仲豪議員，係，畀翻時間我。又係第一個人力資源嘅問題。

543
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:09,240
香港而家已經冇曬位。

544
02:08:09,530 --> 02:08:13,690
佢話要等到呢個三跑開到之後，先有位。

545
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:45,050
區域嘅安排嚟緊，同深圳都有個三排，人哋深圳嘅三排快過我哋，一年就搞掂，我哋要二至二三年。

546
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:16,440
叫做深層水泥拌合法嗰度啊！噉佢我都見咧有一啲嘅專才嘅，一啲好高級嘅技術人員去操控嗰啲機。

547
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:55,740
咁但係喺粵港澳大灣區，香港嘅定位咧，其實好清楚嘅，就係鞏固嗰個國際航空樞紐嘅地位。我哋正正就係為有三跑，就係你話呢樣嘢。

548
02:06:55,610 --> 02:07:10,870
大灣區一個空域類比嘅誒模擬工作，會去分析咧幾個機場入邊嘅一啲數據，去制定一啲具體嘅措施，進一步咧去優化我哋嘅空域同埋航空交通管理。我哋預計呢個工作咧應該係今年年內咧就會完成㗎啦。多謝主席。

549
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:26,600
啊，主席啊，我覺得關鍵咧就喺人工嗰度，即係去其實去三跑翻工咧幾遠嘅，即係我覺得應該係比市區嘅工種咧略為高一點咯，嚇噉你先至真係搞唔掂，你先至申請輸入外勞。噉，唔該主席。好啊，最後少交費員。

550
02:04:56,020 --> 02:05:11,820
噉係咪有政策上嘅支持咧？我哋運房局或者係機管局咧，盡快能夠同內地咧去協調，同深圳咧，我哋點樣分配好我哋個空域，令到我哋起好三跑之後咧，能夠充分運運用咧？唔該，主席。好啊，編委會。

551
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:47,040
噉啊誒去幫助填海需要嘅人手，但係我同時間咧留意到咧有消息咧就係話喺舊年嘅年底咧就係誒都有承辦商一次過咧就係幾百個嘅申請嘅輸入外勞喺補充勞工計劃嗰度，咁但係同時間我見到建造業咧喺今年。

552
02:03:47,040 --> 02:04:07,050
開工嘅情況咧係差咗嘅，即係有啲建造業嘅工友都話：，喺今年開工咧唔係好夠工開。噉係咪有個人手嘅錯配？你點樣能夠善用本地嘅人手，減少嘅輸入外勞？同時間咧，我見到咧，其實我哋上次去參觀咧，喺嗰個誒。

553
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:36,730
咁嚟緊，可能香港咧仲會有大型嘅填海工程啊。咁喺本地呢方面嘅人才培訓係咪能夠早啲做好？透過今次嘅三跑，甚至乎一路做嘢一路培訓，就減少去輸入外勞咧。第二個問題就係誒嗰個想前瞻性啲問下咧，嗰個空？

554
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:35,440
咁首先回答關於啊輸入外勞呢一個問題先啦。咁基建局咧同埋佢嗰個填海承建商咧，其實一直好配合政府嗰個勞工政策，係畀本地人咧優先就業嘅。同埋佢哋都好緊密咁留意本地嗰個勞工市場，按需要噉樣咧去進行招聘。咁三跑道系統咧，佢需要嗰個誒專

555
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:55,450
業嘅人員咧係一啲技術嘅工人嚟嘅，並唔係咧香港嘅一啲主流建造業嘅工種。佢哋呢一啲都係一啲非常之冷門嘅誒行業嚟嘅。咁咧誒，其實佢哋係要有一啲足夠嘅海事工程技術經驗咧，先至可以做到。但係好可惜咧，一路喺香港聘請咧都未可以聘請到足夠嘅呢啲人手。

556
02:05:55,580 --> 02:06:15,590
噉啊！之前頭先啊，陸議員提過啦。舊年係我哋係透過啊補充勞工計劃，勞工處係批咗誒數百個嘅誒空缺，係畀機管局嘅啊承建商去聘請嘅嚇。噉佢哋而家都陸陸續續有誒開始上班㗎啦。咁嚟緊會係。

557
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:50,940
噉啊！下次會議係五月廿七號。

558
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:48,090
情嘅話，我就誒宣佈會議結束。多謝。

559
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:19,480
成個香港嘅經濟，我哋而家你諗下，我頭先講話嗰啲嘅航道，佢唔嚟香港嘅話咧。

560
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:44,340
大家睇住嗰個時間表做啦，又唔好超支同埋嗰個嗰個進度可以誒把握到個時間，好嘛？多謝大家。如果大家冇乜其他事事，

561
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:34,030
佢噉佢飛去邊度？咪飛去周邊嗰啲地方咯，將啲人帶走咗去咯。我哋啲競爭力就係噉樣一拍一拍噉樣減少曬，三拍已經拖慢咗，所以希望即係你誒歸處盡快完成。我只係誒表達意見嘅主席，佢唔使點乜嘢復嘅。哦，好啊，噉啊。

562
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:32,790
係啟動呢個三跑呢一個即係目的，咁所以咧係第一啦，就即係支持大家即係繼續去努力，咁亦都希望咧係遲啲咧有好啲嘅消息咧講畀我哋聽嚇。多謝主持。好啊，唔該。誒，噉啊，呢個疫情都完啦，噉啊，希望。

563
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:35,600
係繼續點嘅樣咧？咁機管局係會透過一個先招聘後培訓嘅一個方式，同埋會喺盡可能嘅情況之下為本地人提供一啲培訓，令到可以誒達到政府目標，就係畀本地工人優先就業嘅。咁第二個問題係關於空域嗰度嘅嚇，民航處咧會繼續透過國家民航局啦，同埋啊澳門民航局組成。

564
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:55,610
嘅三方工作小組去積極研究咧，同埋落實點樣優化珠三角空域嗰個管理嘅措施，務求咧可以逐漸咧誒將香港國際機場三跑道系統達到每小時處理一百零二班航班呢一個長遠嘅目標嘅。咁頭先提到大灣區呢一個嘅啊合作啦，其實三方工作小組而家做緊大。

565
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:46,890
啊，係唔該，主席，就誒想表達下咧，即係呢個三跑系統咧，即係要盡快去做好佢。即係我喺近近排近近年嘅話咧，其實都唔止有一間嘅誒誒，我諗應該可能航空公司定係即係類似噉嘅公司咧聯絡我咧，就話佢哋同。

566
02:07:46,890 --> 02:08:06,900
即係政府想申請啲誒誒航班過嚟香港，其實根本就已經係爆曬冇位，係嚟唔到啊！即係佢上次即係經過啲議員啊去幫手去同政府傾，噉我瞭解內其實根本即係根本都已經爆曬，係講緊嗰啲外國嘅地方開啲航班過嚟香港，為幫我哋帶啲遊客過嚟。

567
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:33,980
噉你即係噉，你可想而知，其實即係如果呢個三跑，我哋唔係即係而家做緊話，你香港真係執笠都得㗎啦。即係根本就已經拖慢咗好多，所以咧即係呢個三跑工程話，你一定要如期完完成啦。噉我喺報章上面聽到，因為其實機沙上面嘅問題嘅話咧，即係可能即係啊要啊負運啊咁等等，即係可能有機會延遲啦。不過咧。

568
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:53,990
咧，即係整體你嘅工程，即係我瞭解，其實都係唔會變嘅。咁即係呢個就不恆不恆中之大恆啦。咁希望即係啊啊貴國家貴處啊等等嘅朋友，即係一定要盡快去做好。同埋咧，即係誒喺誒啊頭先我都聽到，即係喺輸入外勞嗰方面啦。即係對於我哋嚟講，最緊要完成個工程。

569
02:08:53,990 --> 02:09:14,000
嘅啫，所以你喺人手，即係你話如果材料即係誒有穩妥啦，人手嗰方面嘅話咧，如果即係本地嘅朋友係唔夠嘅話咧，輸入外勞，我亦都希望你哋咧盡快即係要求政府配合，可以揾多啲人去完成呢個工程，因為對於我哋香港唔係淨係講喺機場，而喺背後嘅話咧，係整體我哋成。

570
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:55,010
噉啊！大家積極啲做啦，係咪好啊？好，盧偉國議員啦，多主席嚇，因為太多會，所以就誒誒，我先話一先一分鐘一嗱，因為咧係物料供應啦，特別係機砂咧係出現問題咧，都係絕對唔出奇，因為個市場咧不斷變化之中，我諗咧就好希望咧就誒A嘅同。

571
02:09:55,010 --> 02:10:15,020
同事咧都係即係務實面對咧問題咧，即係盡快解決。我知道目前咧呢個問題咧未至影響到整個工程進度，但係咧絕對唔希望咧呢個情況惡化咧，去到影響工程嗰個進度咧，噉就即係極不理想，同埋亦都係即係難以係達到嚇，即係我哋咁急需嘅誒。
