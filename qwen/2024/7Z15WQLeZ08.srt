1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,870
研究。

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,270
啊！

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,340
各位早晨，蘇貞。

4
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,230
去早日完成立法。

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,220
維護國家安全條例草案。

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
去召開特別立法會會議。

7
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,330
正如行政長官多番表示。

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,210
就條例草案進行首讀同埋二讀。

9
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,830
政府同埋立法會都必須盡一切嘅努力。

10
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,270
我哋應合力，盡快堵塞國家安全嘅缺口。

11
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,890
喺剛才嘅立法會會議上咧，已經進行咗首讀同埋二讀。

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,400
昨日我係收到行政長官嘅來信，去建議盡快。

13
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:11,080
我亦認同相關嘅立法工作係有必要性同埋急切性。

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:32,000
法案委員會亦都係緊接喺今日下午咧，就條例草案咧係展開工作。

15
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,590
同基本法第二十三條相關事嘅小組委員會咧，而家已經變身成為。

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:56,520
事實上，《基本法》第二十三條立法係整個香港特區嘅憲制責任。

17
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,140
我相信。

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,680
早一日完成立法。

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,030
我係按照已是規則。

20
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,380
因此，作為立法會主席。

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,720
亦都接獲咗好多正面嘅意見。

22
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,240
維護國家安全立法係特區嘅憲制責任。

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,630
國家安全就會早日得到有效嘅維護。

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,280
亦向政府提出咗好多具體同埋建設性嘅意見。

25
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,030
細心去參詳議員嘅意見，去完善個法例。

26
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,310
依個既係主權國家嘅固有權利，亦都係國際嘅慣例。

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,690
我留意到喺諮詢期間，唔同嘅界別都係積極反映意見。

28
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,190
政府當局會繼續秉承秉持廣攬兼聽嘅精神。

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:23,790
諮詢嘅結果係顯示，就第二十三條立法係獲得高達九十八點六嘅百分比嘅支持。

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:02:00,900
政府喺今日立法會諮詢文件亦都提到，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全嘅法律。

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:38,920
議員亦都係之前嘅小組委員會同埋事務委員會聯席會議上咧，係充分如實反映市民嘅意見。

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:49,750
第十四一同埋二條例嘅規定，喺今日召開咗立法會會議，以盡快履行《基本法》第二十三條立法嘅重要建制責任。

33
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,830
我哋都有信心。

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,620
喺個重要嘅時刻。

35
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,760
我 also fully agree that.

36
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,870
亦係責任重大。

37
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,980
我用英文講幾句啦。

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,160
過去二十七年都未能完成。

39
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,770
改善民生，令一國兩制行穩致遠。

40
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,840
There is a genuine and urgent need for the legislation.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,840
為國家、為香港穩定同埋發展努力。

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,360
能肩負呢個歷史嘅任務咧，係我哋第七屆立法會係感到光榮嘅。

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:48,010
喺完成制定有效維護國家安全法例之後咧，就能夠全力聚焦發展經濟。

44
00:04:51,980 --> 00:05:01,060
both the government and Legco must make every effort to complete the legislation process as soon as possible.

45
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:31,680
全體議員一定係上下一心，全力以赴審慎審議法案條文，以履行我哋嘅憲制職能。

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:51,700
to legislate for Article Twenty-Three of Basic Law is the constitutional duty of the entire Hong Kong SAR.

47
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:25,340
在立法會會議剛剛，《 safeguarding national security》法案，被引入到議會進行第一次和第二次閲讀。

48
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:40,620
The sub committee to study matters relating to Basic Law Article 23 legislation has been turned into Bills Committee and will commence scrutiny of the bill immediately this afternoon.

49
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,380
and we have.

50
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,700
historic mission.

51
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,400
at this critical juncture.

52
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,130
fail to do so in the past 27 years.

53
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,920
and enact laws to safeguard national security.

54
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,810
Meanwhile, legislative members also reflect the views of the people.

55
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,040
as mentioned in the government consultation document, each country

56
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,480
It is the inherent right of the sovereign state, and the international practice.

57
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,960
The Seventh Legislative Council is honoured to be able to shoulder this historical.

58
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,830
with a view to contributing to the stability and development of the country and Hong Kong.

59
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:17,380
We would spare no effort and work together to plug the national security loophole as soon as possible.

60
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:42,810
enactment of legislation to safeguard national security is the constitutional duty of the Hong Kong SAR.

61
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:21,490
truthfully and gave specific and constructive advice to the government during the meetings of the subcommittees and joint panel.

62
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:32,450
I believe that the government will continue to listen extensively and study carefully members' views to enhance the legislation.

63
00:05:51,930 --> 00:06:06,260
我 have note that ninety eight point six per cent of the views received during the consultation period support the legislative exercise and gave positive comments.

64
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:34,980
As the president of LECO, I call a meeting of the council today in accordance with sections 14, bracket one and bracket two of the rules of procedures to fulfil our constitutional duty.

65
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,390
四折。

66
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,390
軍事。

67
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,840
就這兩個人。

68
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
唔會繼續加。

69
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,420
You tell me.

70
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,930
大家有咩問題？

71
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,610
electrical for

72
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,390
resumption of second reading and the third reading.

73
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,010
Why are we rushing? We have you know in.

74
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:33,940
and ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of one country, two system.

75
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:08,390
two weeks, three weeks， they enact 15 to 20 laws. So why can't Hong Kong do it in a speedy manner?

76
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:58,220
The bill is necessary to safeguard the national security. We should enact it. If you look at other countries, they enact it in within a day.

77
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:23,830
Finish scrutiny, it went to you go to the House Committee for report, and then we'll then schedule when you'll come back to the.

78
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:51,300
I think right now the first reading and second reading had just been.

79
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:25,860
我有每有

80
00:07:51,700 --> 00:08:11,710
Through is up to the bills committee to do the work, and I'm sure you know the bills committee will do everything possible to speed up the process. But I think with the legislature, everything is you know we have set process, and I think.

81
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,210
去加快嗰個立法。

82
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,270
is workable.

83
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,070
嗯。

84
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,960
好，大家嚟，唔該。

85
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,260
一日噉，但現時係冇死線，亦都冇一個時間表。

86
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:48,200
緊嘢啊，都留夜翻嚟嘅。咁呢個係佢嘅責任啊，亦都我諗係佢哋嘅榮幸。噉我諗你問個別議員點解佢會？

87
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:25,620
嗱，而家我哋已經進入一個立法程序。頭先咧就已經係首讀同埋二讀，咁跟住咧就因為我哋已經係。

88
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:59,580
翻到嚟去做啦，噉樣雖然琴日嘅通知係好急，但係誒大家都可以講到收到我通知，坐飛機喺北京都翻到嚟啊！嗯，冇錯。

89
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:46,060
開嗰個誒誒小組嗰陣時咧，已經講明咧，一去到首讀二讀咧，就會轉為一個泛愛委員會。咁泛愛委員會主席誒廖長江議員咧，就會同立法誒同呢個呢個泛愛委員會咧，會盡一切努力去完成呢個工作。立法。

90
00:09:46,060 --> 00:10:06,070
法會嘅工作都係一步一步嘅，咁一定係要法案委會完成咗之後去內會彙報，咁然後至可以翻翻嚟大會。噉我哋係靜候啊，皆音希望即係廖長江議員同埋啊所有議員咧係一齊工作。我哋嘅目標都係啊早一日。

91
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:39,220
我諗誒，當議員知道有一個咁重要嘅法案首讀二讀咧，大家頭先我覺得咧，依一個都係我哋嘅第七屆立法會嘅光明。咁大家係盡一切時間誒去做。我知道有啲議員係已經來往咗誒北京兩次啊，有啲喺外地誒做緊。
