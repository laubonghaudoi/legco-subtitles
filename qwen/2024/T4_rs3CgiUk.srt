1
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,960
界線。

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,440
各位。

3
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,380
我想強調。

4
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,280
實在係振奮人心嘅。

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,050
確保咗香港今後能夠喺。

6
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,930
同時為國家嘅高質量發展出力。

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,090
我係十分高興，《維護國家安全條例草案》。

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,210
經過一整天高質量嘅審議同埋辯論。

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,190
同時係亦都代表香港踏入一個新嘅一頁。

10
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,610
維護國家安全條例係切合國家同埋香港社會嘅需要。

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,790
係獲得第七屆立法會喺今日嘅六點五十三分三讀通過。

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,910
香港特區維護國家安全嘅法律制度同埋執行機制係得以完善。

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:08,350
更安定嘅社會環境下，集中精力，替造一個更繁榮嘅香港。

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:42,880
第七屆立法會今日就《基本法》第二十三條立法嘅審議工作畫上咗完滿嘅句號。

15
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:12,310
今日對立法會、對特區政府同埋對全港市民嚟講咧，都係具有重大歷史意義嘅日子。

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:35,760
條文係按照現行普通法嘅常用語言去編寫，清晰易明，令大眾更瞭解法律嘅。

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,910
兼融互補。

18
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,230
及時防範。

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,210
我係十分認同行政長官嘅建議。

20
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,920
去堵塞國家安全嘅缺口。

21
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,310
係整個香港特區嘅憲制責任。

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,540
同時，亦都完善咗現有嘅法例。

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,590
抵禦同埋消除國家安全嘅風險。

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,460
再以香港實際嘅情況去立法。

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,690
條例草案同香港國安法相輔相成。

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,270
今次亦都借鑒咗其他普通法國家嘅經驗。

27
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,380
維護國家安全，就《基本法》第二十三條立法。

28
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,790
跟住行政長官所講嘅，早得早一日，得一日。

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,030
更有效係實施維護國家安全嘅機制。

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,990
正如行政長官喺三月七日向我致函嗰陣時強調。

31
00:02:51,580 --> 00:03:03,870
立法工作係刻不容緩，所以喺第日就召開特別會議，去啟動條例草案嘅二首讀同埋二讀程序。

32
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:28,100
另一個重要嘅要點就係條例草案，亦都係依法保障香港居民基本法同埋相關國際公約下所享有嘅基本人權同埋自由。

33
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,230
沈晨。

34
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,390
監察得到。

35
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,700
包括加入條文。

36
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,630
另外就。

37
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,630
議員提問咗過千條嘅問題。

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,750
嚴謹同埋全面去研究每項條文。

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,490
法案委員會更加開咗馬拉松式嘅會議。

40
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,640
整個審議係公開透明，公眾係可以睇得到。

41
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,640
消除咗唔少疑慮，亦都反駁咗唔少謬誤。

42
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:01,510
罪行同埋多項字眼嘅定義係作出咗修訂，令到法案更加完善。

43
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:51,330
副權行政長官會同行政會議可以訂立維護國家安全嘅附屬法例。

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,750
立法去過喺過去兩個星期咧，議員同埋政府官員咧係合力審議咗個法案。

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:47,030
議員理職盡責，全力以赴，問得貼地；官員亦都係準備充足，答得到位。

46
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:13,700
相信大家都認同呢一個過程係高質、高效同埋認真，亦都顯示咗行政立法關係嘅良性互動。

47
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:26,860
審議依個質素咧係達至新嘅高度、新嘅標準，為我哋日後嘅法案審議工作起咗良好嘅示範作用。

48
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:40,800
喺法案委員會審議維護國家安全條例嘅條文嗰陣時，政府亦從善如流，接納議員提出多項建設性嘅意見。

49
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,760
係。

50
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,780
翻啲嘢一路。

51
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,210
本身都影子。

52
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,250
即係會唔會？

53
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,650
當年嘅雪麗。

54
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,730
錯咗個慣例。

55
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,960
即係話，成個面嗰個。

56
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,290
主席，即係今日你都。

57
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,830
提到，即係如果你嘅一票。

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,940
從今日起，香港會成為一個更宜居。

59
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,860
維護國家安全條例係充分體現咗特區政府。

60
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,030
同埋立法會對國家對全港市民嘅責任同埋承擔。

61
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:10,480
同時，亦都彰顯咗行政立法目標一致、步伐協調、齊心為香港去打拼。

62
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:39,360
啊！第一樣嘢，我頭先都講咗啦。二十三條立法咧，唔係一個普通嘅立法，係我哋拖欠咗國家。

63
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:39,510
更易遊，更適宜大家嚟營商同埋發展嘅地方，國家同埋香港更繁榮穩定，百業興旺，市民安居樂業。

64
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:59,800
一國兩制係行穩致遠嘅。最後，我係感謝所有嘅官員同埋我哋立法會秘書長同副秘書長帶領嘅團隊去支援今次嘅立法工作，令到呢個立法係得以喺順利同埋短時間去完成。

65
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,900
how do you

66
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,500
Why did you?

67
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,270
係，因為。

68
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,160
apping of the.

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,900
係。

70
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,150
嗰時嚇。

71
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,720
啊！

72
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,790
A special occasion for special consideration, and I want to have.

73
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,470
Now I just I repeated in English that usually the president refrains from voting.

74
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:25,210
八十九人投票，八十九個全票通過，咁依個係一個歷史時刻，將來嘅。

75
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:34,770
有唔同嘅，我明白呢個係一個好大嘅突破，但係呢啲突破就係一突破嘅時刻係要做嘅。

76
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:25,480
永恆、 prosperity and stability of the country and Hong Kong would be short of solid foundation, and we owe

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:57,290
將近二十七年，咁呢一個咧，其實係關乎唔單止係香港嘅本地法例，而係關乎國家嘅啊安全福祉。如果冇國家，我哋香港點樣發展繁榮，都係冇實際嘅基礎。

78
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:17,580
噉我今次去做嘅就係我覺得，我哋全體嘅議員咁辛苦去審議條法案，大家嘅意見都係一致去投贊成票。噉我覺得今次嘅完美審議，我係值得去投票，令到我哋有完美嘅成績表。

79
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:15,760
但the legislating of Article Twenty Three is not merely a Hong Kong law. It's not an ordinary legislation. It concern the national security and the well being of both Hong Kong and our motherland. And with our national security, the develop

80
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:47,010
Country, twenty more more than twenty six year for delaying the legislation of Article Twenty Three. I know my fellow legislator work extremely hard, and they have expressed they will all vote for the legislation, and I think this is.

81
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,100
怪聲。

82
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,550
officials.

83
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,430
How do you feel?

84
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,250
global downgrading of

85
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,650
喺香港，佢跑。

86
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,310
所以，Mrs Regina。

87
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
now and what?

88
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,610
我唔想知道多啲。

89
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,620
Mr. Chan, Stephen.

90
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,290
Why do you think there's more impetus

91
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,620
plain the law or to move on? Why so?

92
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,730
Just Hong Kong phase and how's it different from 2005?

93
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,370
second attempt as a lawmaker, and as you mentioned previously.

94
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,360
Would the next step be to continue?

95
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,570
八十 nine members， we have eighty nine votes.

96
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:01,170
perfect， you know， record， so I vote this time， so that we have。

97
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,840
二。

98
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,500
都唔係其實。

99
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,030
啊，唔知呢？

100
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,990
whatever comes。

101
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,610
as well as possible downgrade it.

102
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,810
It comes, we don't mind.

103
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,700
Indices against Hong Kong for passing.

104
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,190
你可以見其他國家做一切，嚟保護佢哋嘅國家安全。

105
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:45,050
I'll let Martin to answer the first part, and then Regina answer the second. Sorry, so what was the first part? I'm also listening.

106
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:04,170
sorry，downgrading of what？travel，travel。Well，I，yeah，later。Well，I can only tell you one thing。

107
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:40,250
whatever will come will come, okay. But that's not my consideration. I think you know what Martin said is for. I can also speak for all my legislator. You know, we have to legislate for the security of our country and Hong Kong.

108
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:24,550
我我諗會做，會just做what we think is right to do。我諗we're doing the right thing， and i i don't think we give other consideration。 no extraneous matter can influence us in one way or another。 we'll just go and do the right thing， and this is the right thing to do。 so you're confident that sanctions won't come because it's the right thing。 well

109
00:10:50,470 --> 00:11:10,480
And why can't we protect our national security? Okay, be it downgrade, be it whatever, you know, we don't mind. But Hong Kong is such a beautiful place for doing business and travelling into Hong Kong. So if they don't come, if they don't do business here, they miss their chances.

110
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:32,360
The Safeguarding National Security Bill, which was just enacted, will make Hong Kong safer and more secure. So I don't see why any country would want to downgrade the travel advisory. As the president pointed out, Hong Kong is a very appealing city. I think people who take action

111
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,350
有大有小。

112
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,370
Two outcompetors on the mainland.

113
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,850
announcing the Article 23.

114
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,460
好啦，我哋都做咗成日啦，最後一條問題。

115
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:34,070
Legislation is not only a constitutional duty; it's actually a legal requirement under the Basic Law.

116
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,840
我的普通話不好，李衞瓊，你來吧。李衞瓊，啊，李大，李衞瓊，李衞瓊。

117
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:15,070
促發展、改善經濟，啊，為民為民生做更多實事，好嘛？多謝，好啦，拜拜，拜拜。

118
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:43,910
and this is also a moral responsibility to safeguard the national security because we we do have a moral responsibility as well.

119
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:23,970
more secure going forward, and this legislation is good for everybody, for the country and for the entire community of Hong Kong. Yes, I also wish to emphasise that.

120
00:12:46,650 --> 00:13:01,720
所以我們 not talking about Hong Kong security here. We're talking about national security. So I think I think we we have to get that right. You know, have to keep our eye on the ball. That we have to focus on national security and not Hong Kong security. And we have that responsibility.

121
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:52,370
against us who downgrades us or threatens sanctions against us, they will regret it, and we are not daunted by these threats. As for myself, I am deeply honoured that I am able to take part in this legislative exercise for the second time in different capacities. The complete

122
00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:12,380
iction of our constitutional duty to safeguard national security is long overdue. We are all very happy that we are finally able to complete this highly honourable duty, and I'm sure Hong Kong will do better going forward. We will become more prosperous, more safe.

123
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:46,850
啊，其，誒，其實，其實，誒，我們現在完成我們的二十三條立法，那就好像那個丁總理跟我們説一樣，我們可以輕裝上陣，集中精力發展經濟，改善民生。我相信我們全體立法會議員，議員會好像，啊，維護國家安全一樣，以同樣的拼。

124
00:13:46,850 --> 00:14:06,860
去為香港拼經濟、謀發展，呃，融入國家發展大局，包括大灣區的建設。其實我們很多同事來自不同背景，也有不同的年紀。其實過去、現在、將來，他們一定會做更多的工作。我們也相信行政長官帶領下的特區政府，也可以全心全意。
