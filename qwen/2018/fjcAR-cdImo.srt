1
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,260
家電房。

2
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,590
嗯。

3
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,270
喺嗰邊。

4
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,550
都係中銀香港嘅誒顧問。

5
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:47,110
早晨，阿張首席助理秘書長。早晨，各位金管局同埋律政處。

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,730
首先，我代表小組委員會咧，歡迎今日誒各個出席嘅團體代表咧出席今日嘅會議啦。早晨，各位。

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:56,400
等嘅代表嚇，噉我我哋因為夠法定人數咧，我哋而家就邀請誒銀行團體嘅代表，亦都一齊入嚟啦。

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,990
議員噉啊，我哋夠鍾開會，亦都夠法定人數。噉啊，不如咁啦，我哋先誒邀請誒今日議會嘅一啲公眾人士入嚟先，好唔好？唔該。

9
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:49,210
及特權條例所規定嘅保障同埋豁免嘅，噉我哋而家開始誒團體代表嘅發言。首先請誒大新銀行嘅代表阿黃柏玲先生誒發言先啦，唔該，黃生。唔該，誒主席，各位議員，早晨。

10
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:43,100
嘅誒法律草擬高級助理法律草擬專員阿林少忠先生啦，誒亦都係高級政府律師朱影紅女士，亦都係誒仲有咧就係另外一位金管局誒處置機構辦公室嘅陳健怡女士嘅，噉啊～

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:24,660
噉我介紹下今日誒政府嘅代表先啦。噉啊，包括財經事務及副務局啊，張首席助理秘書長，誒香港金融管理局處處置機構辦公室嘅Mister Amon Wright，誒亦都係金管局處置機構辦公室嘅Mister Robert Pobian，誒律政司嘅。

12
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,600
或稱豬血。

13
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,430
我將簡潔敍述我哋嘅意見。

14
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,220
本地銀行已被視作資本充裕。

15
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,050
由於我們為十分小型嘅銀行。

16
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,940
相關規定並並並不適用於我哋。

17
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,170
香港本地銀行於全球金融危機期間。

18
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,890
雖然根據原先巴塞爾協定二之規定。

19
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,760
有賴金融香港金融管理局之監管措施。

20
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,140
或之後均無需政府動用公帑協助。

21
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,420
誒虧損能力簡稱LAC之草案規則之討論。

22
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,900
隨著金管局於今年一月發出LAC嘅諮詢文件後，

23
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:56,900
啊！十分感謝小組委員會邀請我哋今日啊參加今日誒呢個吸收吸收。

24
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:04,660
我們相信以前本港本地銀行資本充足率，相對任何全球標準，應該是相當充裕。

25
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:16,270
當LAC與歐美討論呢個議題時，個議題目標似乎只係針對具系統重要性之國際銀行。

26
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:54,990
但於全球金融危機後，本地銀行明白需維持更高嘅資本要求及遵從更多嘅規管，而以大幅提升資本充足水平。

27
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:16,910
由創興銀行、大新銀行、富邦銀行、大眾銀行及上海商業銀行組成嘅小型銀行組啊組隊咧，已提交咗書面意見給予啊小組委員會。

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:02:11,020
咁誒就呢個金融機構儲置機制吸收虧損能力規定銀行規規則發表意見噉啊誒好多謝你哋咁早一齊嚟到呢度。噉我亦都歡迎政府當局頭先誒講過嘅代表出席啦。首先我要申報下利益先，我誒係呢個小組委員會嘅主席，但係我本身亦都。

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:33,840
咁誒，我想講咧，就係各位代表，如果需要即時傳譯服務嘅議會人士咧，請戴上耳筒同埋麥啦。誒，你哋可以選擇頻道嘅頻道零就係現場收音，頻道一係廣東話，頻道二係英語，頻道三就係普通話。今日一共有九個團體代表出席，其中咧七個團體代

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:53,850
代表會發言嘅噉，另外秘書處亦都喺會前收到誒五份嘅意見書啦。噉就其中一份咧係由五間銀聯銀行咧聯合去提交嘅。我今日會先請各個團體代表咧輪流發言，每個團體嘅發言時限係五分鐘。發言完畢之後咧，我會請政府當局嘅。

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:13,860
代表咧作出初步嘅回應，然後委員咧可以向團體代表，又或者向政府當局咧提問嘅。按照慣常嘅做法咧，除非有關團體或者人士表明咧佢提交嘅意見書係唔可以公開，否則咧秘書處已經將大家嘅意見書咧上載去立法會嘅網頁㗎啦，亦。

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:33,870
都已經分發畀各個委員去誒參考。如果團體代表係未有提交意見書，或者尚有意見書需要補充，你哋嘅意見咧，亦都請你哋盡快喺會後提供。噉我要提醒出席嘅各位團體代表咧，你哋嘅意見書同埋會上嘅發言咧，都唔會誒享有立法會權力。

33
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,010
啲雪。

34
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,560
及按其權力而決定。

35
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,790
及本地系統重要性銀行，或稱。

36
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,640
並認為金管局之門檻標準實為太低。

37
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,560
我們肯請各委員再作檢視。

38
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,490
會小組委員提交我哋與我們最初交與金管局大致相同嘅意見。

39
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:04,430
我哋認為小型銀行不應受LAC規則所規範嘅理由，很明很明確。

40
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,150
我們獲知其系統重要性之定義為，金管局可根據LAC的規定。

41
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,980
亦因此，不應被納入LAC之規限，並懇請得到小組委員會嘅支持及理解。

42
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,890
我們建議以百分之二市場佔有率之門檻係標準嚟取代。

43
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,280
有別於普遍設立為具系統性重要銀行之定義，即諸説。

44
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:25,740
我們認為小型銀行不應被視作草擬LAC規則內所述之具系統重要性銀行。

45
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,430
小型銀行並不足以以構成需被納入LAC規定之系統重要性銀行。

46
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:13,490
我哋提交及小組委員會嘅意見，書面意見包括六點理由。由於時間所限，我不一一讀出。

47
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:11,450
我們對於LAC嘅規定可能會規範某些，好似我哋係喺市場佔有率少於百分之二嘅小型銀行感到憂慮，因此我哋於今年三月十五日向金管局喺呢方面提交了意見。

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:31,970
於今年十月十九日刊發之《十務守則》草擬稿中，金管局將納入L.E.C.規定嘅門檻，定為綜合資產總資產係一千五百億港元，或現時市場佔有率誒大約為零點六個percent。我哋就此向立法。

49
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,620
我哋嘅結論係一。

50
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,880
即不需要用納税人嘅金錢舒困。

51
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,560
三，由於小型銀行不具不具系統重要性。

52
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,770
resolution of entities and material subsidiaries, so they reach the point of non-viability.

53
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,630
並削弱其為本地中小企業及社區提供更好銀行服務嘅能力。

54
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,770
二LAC嘅實施將給小型銀行帶來重大且無成效嘅成本。

55
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,300
on behalf of BOC Hong Kong, it's a deepest honour to express my gratitude to your close attention to the draft rule.

56
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,820
全球嘅監管機構只專注於誒應用此規則於assets及assets。

57
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:44,970
of the total light requirement framework and its profound impact. Today, I would like to briefly share our views on the draft.

58
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:28,240
Good morning, Mr. Chairman Chan and members of the Committee on Financial Institution Resolution Requirement Banking Sector Rules.

59
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:27,850
因此，如果小型銀行有倒閉情況，其處置將不會引致對香港金融系統重大衝擊。

60
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:46,340
亞洲沒有其他監管機構將這些規模誒規則應用於小型銀行，而且很多根本沒有應用LAC嘅規則。

61
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:42,810
我們建議修改草案規則之第五條內所述之門檻標準，應以綜合總資產於市場佔有率不少於百分之二計算而免除小型銀行受LAC之規管。

62
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:18,900
誒，國會議員表述我哋嘅意見，多謝主席。誒，多謝。頭先誒發言嘅就係大新銀行阿黃百玲副行政總裁。咁跟住落嚟咧，就係誒中國銀行香港有限公司嘅副總經理阿嚴婉君女士。請唔該。

63
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,280
For instance.

64
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,900
within the GC groups.

65
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,250
主席，This concludes my view. Once again, thank you for attention.

66
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,300
sufficient room for MA to accommodate the request from the industry.

67
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,830
Taking into consideration of Hong Kong unique status and situations when formulating its own TLE standard.

68
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:49,400
We understand that effective resolution to international financial institutions relies on effective cross-border cooperation between resolution authorities.

69
00:10:50,120 --> 00:11:00,780
This is a prerequisite, not just for implementation of TLEP framework, but also for whole resolution planning phase and rule-making phase of minimum TLEP requirement.

70
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:44,610
ENEG會 need considerably more time to prepare and implement the TLEP in order to fine-tuning the financing structure and increase weight of debt securities.

71
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:33,210
The FSB has requested EMEEGCP to implement that requirement in a phased approach, starting from 2025 to 2028, about six years later than non-EMEEGCP.

72
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:41,730
We hope the MA will reach out agreements and consensus with home authorities in regards with implementation schedule and specifics of internal TLab requirements for material subsidiaries of EMEGSE in Hong Kong.

73
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:19,360
In pushing to FSB Teletext standard, host and home resolution entities should reach out an agreement through CMG. When formulating internal Teletext requirements to material subsidiaries of GIC, we trust that MA has made significant effort in this regard.

74
00:11:44,890 --> 00:12:04,190
Material subsidiaries of EMGZ are facing similar challenges in Hong Kong. In consideration of macroeconomic conditions in emerging market countries and practical situations, EMGZ will face a dilemma if MA implements a much earlier schedule for their material subsidiaries in Hong Kong.

75
00:08:43,110 --> 00:09:03,120
我哋肯請小組委員會考慮修改LAC規則，以清楚界定資説、資説和總和總資產超過本地銀行市場佔有率多於百分之二嘅認可機構為納入LAC規限資處置實體。再次感謝小組委員邀請我哋今日出席嘅會議及向。

76
00:09:45,250 --> 00:10:05,260
首先，我們完全支持EMA嘅努力，來 establish the TLEF framework in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a preeminent global financial centre that plays host of twenty nine out of the thirty GCF. We believe the implementation will enhance the stability and effective operation of Hong Kong financial system and facilitate orderly.

77
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:31,220
The TIA framework that meets international standard will undoubtedly enhance Hong Kong's status as global financial centre and highly valued by the industry. We understand just as other initiatives of resolution planning that on the condition to ensure largely consistency with FSB standard. The MA has.

78
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,180
According to the Code of Practice consultation set out by the Hong Kong MA.

79
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,840
of a recovery and resolution framework to safeguard the stability of the financial system of Hong Kong.

80
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,150
應該由該項資產的法律性質來決定，而不是由其會計分類決定。

81
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:31,130
The instrument accounted for as equity on the AI's balance sheet, such as 81 instruments, will not be considered as a debt component of lag.

82
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:21,400
台所指嘅一千五百億嚇，依個門檻方面啦，同埋嗰個時間表啦，各方面其實係咪應該可以即係考慮可以將個門檻提升啊，將個時間表可以誒？

83
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:48,030
In fact, those eighty-one instruments being classified as equity under the accounting rules are actually available for loss absorption during the resolution situation, as they are not subject to any hard trigger threshold for write-off during the pre-resolution period.

84
00:14:51,710 --> 00:15:10,130
業可以成個經濟入邊個個增長係有一個支援嘅，咁希望呢啲各方面意見可以大家可以接納到嘅。咁最後我諗我哋想提到兩點咧，就係話第一方面咧就話，如果假設誒，如果最後呢個機制一定要去執行嘅時候咧，其實都希望第一嗰個門檻嚇，跟之前嗰個code of practice出。

85
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:24,480
在 some we earnestly request M&A to fully consider a coordinated implementation arrangement of TLEP for EMEGZIP and their material subsidiaries to promote more effective cross-border resolution coordination and optimal allocation of TLEP capabilities between juristic.

86
00:12:42,010 --> 00:13:02,020
Meanwhile, we suggest MA to suggest adopting minimum TLAC requirements of eighteen percent under the FSB standard and allow a phasing approach. As Hong Kong has already rolled out more prudent and stringent regulatory capital requirements and standards than vast majority of other jurisdictions, we trust there's.

87
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:27,060
Lastly, we agree that implementing localised regulatory framework that meets best international standard will improve financial sustainability and enhance Hong Kong's status as global financial centre. But we do believe that a fair and reasonable regulatory framework would help providing level playing field for all market participants.

88
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:51,540
誒，唔該曬誒，阿嚴副總經理。跟住落嚟咧，係誒創興銀行有限公司陳錦基財務總監，唔該。好啊，誒多謝主席、各位議員、誒金管局、誒財經事務局嘅各位誒代表嚇，早晨嚇。首先我諗多謝誒主席誒或者委。

89
00:13:51,540 --> 00:14:11,550
係畀我哋有個機會可以喺處發言嚇，噉我諗我哋創興銀行嘅，其實我哋喺誒整個過程當中嘅時候，我哋都啊同啊黃生啊其他業界咧，亦都有好多同誒金管局好多接觸嘅嚇。咁喺個過程當中嘅時候咧，我諗我哋曾經表述過嗰啲意見，或者喺今日都唔再重複啦嚇。噉我諗第一點。

90
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:31,560
點嘅話，其實我哋想重新嘅話，就係我哋喺業界入邊，其實我哋係支持政府當局、金管局推人所有嘅措施，點可以穩定到香港金融業嗰個穩定、穩健嘅個增長嚇。咁但係當中嘅時候，噉我哋提及過嗰啲觀點嘅話，其實我哋相信喺書面入邊誒，仲話黃生提及過啲論據嘅話，其實我哋都相信。

91
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:51,710
係呢啲係可以幫助到香港銀行業，係成個金融市場有一個穩健嘅，同埋一個健康，亦都有一個具競爭力嚇，即係同喺國際市場面度具競爭力各方面嘅發展。咁亦都希望我哋自己本身即係作為喺業界當中就係可以支持到香港成個整體經濟嚇，作為金。

92
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,250
Our bank therefore proposes that for those 81 instruments.

93
00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:01,910
Although account for as equity, they should be considered and included in the debt component for the minimum debt calculations for the lag requirement.

94
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:27,660
The reason being that all such AIs may need to raise significant amount of lead instruments in the market for fulfilling the required lead position in a relatively short period of time.

95
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:16,370
第二，我們 noted that it is a general concern of the industry that the proposed implementation timeline of lag for non-Gzip AIs for meeting the lag requirements in 24 months is rather too tight.

96
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:16,990
作過程裏邊嚟講，係咪可以再評估喺對於香港個經濟影響程度嗰個嗰個誒誒關鍵性誒，然之後逐間去考慮誒係咪需要納入去呢個L.C.呢個噉樣嘅誒處置機制裏邊嘅？

97
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:52,540
嘅競爭咧，佢可能亦都需要將呢個牙癌嘅成本都要誒有能力去轉價去，或者係有個誒機會去轉價去誒畀客户咧，先至可以去誒維持佢嗰個盈利嘅同埋業務嘅發展，否則。

98
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:44,200
given the volatile economic condition and tightening market appetite for primary bond supply, fundraising through debt capital markets will be a big challenge for all of us, and the resultant high funding cost is going to put pressure on the bank's profitability.

99
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:41,950
誒請上海商業銀行有限公司嘅雍麗善財務總監誒發言嘅，請唔該。多多謝主席誒各位議員，阿黃百玲先生咧已經代表小型銀行同埋我哋嘅銀行咧就發表咗意見嘅，噉我冇額外嘅補充。

100
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:41,690
畀一個較為長嘅時間，佢令到業界方面嘅各方面嘅準備會做得好啲。咁最後嘅時候咧，我諗我哋都會即係一定會係喺業界當中會即係支持或者配合成個個發展啦，成個銀行業嘅發展。嚇噉，但係我諗正話誒，兩位都發言都提及過，除咗個所謂嘅叻嗰個利息嘅資之外咧，其實成個儲置。

101
00:15:41,690 --> 00:16:01,700
機制方面咧，喺個配套方面，點去做一個所謂resolution plan嚇？有冇定立我哋嗰個策略？咁其實呢個都會耗用相當多嘅內部資源嘅。咁希望呢個好重大嘅支出嗰陣時候咧，我都希望就話喺誒當喺個實法案實施嗰時候咧，希望有個彈性嘅處理，亦都較為可以喺誒唔同。

102
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:21,710
類型銀行嘅時候咧，希望嗰個時間表啦，同埋要求咧，係畀一個較為長同埋清晰嘅指引，咁以便我哋可以去即係可以執行得到嘅嚇。咁呢個係我哋誒一部分嘅意見，同大家分享嘅。好，誒唔該曬阿阿陳總監。咁誒接住落嚟咧，係東亞銀行有限公司。

103
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:41,720
王漢成副行政總裁兼營運總監，阿唐總監，唔該。Good morning, Chairman. Thank you for inviting the Bank of Asia to give our view on the rules prescribing loss-absorbing capacity for authorised institution in Hong Kong. I take this opportunity to state that our bank is fully supportive of the development and implementation.

104
00:16:48,120 --> 00:17:08,130
In respect of the proposed debt rules and the debt code of practice consultation, our bank has two major comments. First, while we understand the rationale to have the minimum debt requirement aiming for the AI to be recapitalised without an external source of funds, we have the view that the loss-absorbing debt quality

105
00:18:44,550 --> 00:19:04,560
as such, events suggest that MA should formulate the implementation timeline in a more flexible manner. In order to achieve a smooth implementation for lag, the authority should review the proposed time that deadline for meeting the lag requirements for each individual AI according to its specific situation and its actual.

106
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:24,570
gap position of the lab compliance, Hong Kong MA may consider introduce a phasing approach for implementation starting from year two thousand and twenty-two. I hope the authority could consider our bank's comments and suggestions. Thank you very much. 啊，唔該曬啊，唐總裁，跟住落嚟咧，我哋係。

107
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,120
啊，some of our peer banks about the applicability of the.

108
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,430
Thank. Good morning, committee chairman and committee members.

109
00:19:42,290 --> 00:20:02,300
哦，好唔該。咁誒接住咯，我哋就有南洋商業銀行有限公司簡麗芬財務管理處主管嘅，請啊簡主管唔該。係誒各位誒，我代表南洋商業銀行咧誒發表一個意見嘅。咁其實頭先誒有好多同業都提出就係話誒，響個徵詢誒嗰個徵。

110
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:22,310
申稿裏邊咧都啊，今個提出就係要以一個一千五百億港元總資產值咧，作為評估我哋本地註冊銀行係咪要納入呢個嘅儲資機制嘅底線咧。我哋銀行嘅意見都係認為呢一個係誒需要有所考慮，因為誒喺呢個情況，我哋都覺得喺其他誒參考其他國際地區咧。

111
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:42,320
嗰個對LAC嘅要求咧，亦都主要係針對誒全球或者係本地系統重要性嘅銀行咧，去誒先推出呢一樣嘅要求。咁由於我哋覺得即係話，如果將全港所有誒銀行都差不多都納入曬落呢個機制裏邊嚟講咧，咁其實都未必係完全話即係能。

112
00:20:42,320 --> 00:21:02,330
咪能夠達到即係原本個目的，就係話維持個金融嗰個嗰個穩定性，係咪真係誒有個個誒益處咧？同一時間推出噉，所以咧，我哋認為咧，即係響推出嘅時間咧，應該就係要有所即係循序漸進啦。有誒中對於中小型銀行裏邊嚟講，即係佢哋已經係誒響嗰個運。

113
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:37,280
咁另外，我哋都考慮啦。如果要即係畀納入去做LAC嘅銀行咧，噉佢都需要係要滿足一點五至到兩倍嘅LAC要求嘅話，咁即係話我哋要誒額外增加一個即係個發債嘅成本啦。咁而對於呢個發債成本，銀對於銀行嚟講，佢係要面對其他大型銀行或者市場。

114
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:13,230
其實如果將差不多所有嘅本港銀行都將佢納入去LIC，係咪反而會對於我哋香港地區金融嗰個嗰個發展會唔會誒有個負面影響咧？咁所以我哋都係建議就係話要將呢個一千五百億嘅呢個總資產值嘅底線再去考慮，係咪可以修改為誒考慮？譬如話喺

115
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:33,240
用一啲嘅整個佔一個整個市場嘅比例，譬如話誒係，譬如話佔誒本地註冊銀行嘅總資產值嘅三percent去考慮，及究竟係咪需要納入去嘅。咁另外，我哋覺得誒，因為誒都有個誒要求，就係話除咗要誒做本港嘅銀行咧，其實都要對誒可能要對。

116
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:53,250
一個成成個整個集團性咧，係要包含在內，佢要做呢個LAC。噉我哋覺得就係話誒，除如果噉樣做法咧，就除咗我哋我哋銀行響誒發行呢個債券嘅時候咧，除咗要誒cover我哋自己香港嘅業務咧，其實要更多就係要cover翻誒其其他地。

117
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:13,260
地區子公司個處置機製成本啦，尤其是如果成個集團可能其他地區個子公司咧個佔比反而誒可能有一定程度再誒佔比比較高嘅時候咧，我哋覺得反而我哋法制嘅成本係主要係處理咗其他地區嗰個處置成本，咁會唔會一個合適嘅一個誒誒做法咧？咁？

118
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:33,270
所以我哋建議係咪現階段都係推行至到我哋誒本地銀行嘅銀行層面，譬如話combined level或者surreal level，而其他地區嘅子公司咧就按翻佢哋自己當地註冊嘅監管條例進行佢嗰個處置計劃嘅。咁另外最後咧，我哋都都建議就係話誒，如果真係要推出嘅話，

119
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:53,280
話都應該考慮就話，如果得兩年嘅時間去誒誒要求銀行去提升嗰個即係去符合嗰個L.C.嘅暫緩要求咧，噉我哋覺得喺同一時間市場要要吸納咁大量嘅資金，咁有可能會令到個市場利率會上升啦。咁銀行都要偏誒承擔偏高嘅成本嘅，咁會唔會係？

120
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:13,290
不利於香港嘅整體經濟發展咧，咁所以我哋都建議係要需要分批進行啦。咁譬如話大型銀行可能即係會喺二零二年達標啦，咁中小型銀行可唔可以去另一個階段就延遲到譬如話二零二四啊？誒呢啲年誒整體上面個分階段嘅時間表可以有所誒推遲咯。嚇，咁多謝各位。

121
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:33,300
好啊，唔該啊，簡主管。咁誒，接住落嚟咧，就係富邦銀行香港有限公司嘅亢國榮高級副總裁同埋金融市場部門主管嘅，請阿亢生。啊，多謝主席。啊，各位議員早晨。係，其實我都頭誒好同意頭先誒在座各位業界嘅代表所講嘅誒內。

122
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:53,310
同埋嗰個誒，即係嗰個誒原因點解要誒LAC啊啊，可唔可以推遲？咁其實我哋誒補充嘅唔會太多，只不過係係因為中資銀行確實喺現今呢個經營環境之下咧，其實係確實好睏難。咁況且加上呢個未來。

123
00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:13,320
嘅經濟環境，同埋加上即係政治不明朗等等因素，咁誒都構成銀行喺未來，我相信係嗰個經營係十分之困難。咁如果而家加上推呢個L.A.C.嘅話咧，咁誒可以話係百上加斤。咁可唔可以即係誒強調一點，就話喺嗰個時間準備方？

124
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:33,330
方面咧，可以畀中資嘅銀行咧係較多嘅時間可以去準備，因為依個誒第一就話根本而家係銀行經營嗰個誒成本上升啊、資源不足啊咁等等已經係好睏難。咁如果再加上依一樣突然間嚟嘅一個啊L A C requirement咧。

125
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,970
instruments.

126
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,200
穩定和有效應運香港金融系統。

127
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,710
which will undermine their profitability and weaken their competitiveness in the market.

128
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,120
which is only about two point five percent of the total assets of OAs in Hong Kong.

129
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:32,620
That means almost all local banks will be classified as resolution entity and accordingly be subject to F.A.C. requirements.

130
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:59,760
First, such LAC requirement should only be applicable to those systemic important banks, but not to those small bank in Hong Kong.

131
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:31,570
It's my pleasure to be here to give our view on behalf of our bank on financial institution resolution loss-absorbing capacity requirement, banking sector rules.

132
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:05,420
important and its non-viability would pose a risk to financial stability in Hong Kong, including to the continual performance of critical financial functions.

133
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:31,450
AI with this size would not be likely to pose a risk to the stability and effective working of the financial system of Hong Kong. This can also avoid threatening the competition for small AIs in Hong Kong.

134
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:50,750
In general, we have no objection on the basic principle that resolution entity and material subsidiary should be required to meet LAC requirement in order to facilitate the orderly resolution of non-viable AIS. However, we would like to express our view on certain areas.

135
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:52,370
Therefore, such smaller banks should not be should not be classified as resolution entity and material subsidiary, and should not be subject to LAC requirements. To be in line with the approach of setting systemically important banks, it is more appropriate to set the LAC requirement to cover

136
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:53,340
係相信係誒，好多銀行都係好吃力，咁所以係懇請誒大家誒，即係議員或者係誒M A方面係考慮我哋中資銀行係係喺個未來嗰個經營環境之下，係如果再推行呢個L A C嘅話咧，係會遇到一定嘅嘅即係好。

137
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:13,350
好大嘅困難嚇，多謝主席。好誒，唔該曬，康主管誒。我想問下誒華僑永亨或者係招商永隆兩位銀行嘅代表，想唔想誒講嘢？好咁誒，邊位先咧？係華僑永亨誒有限公司陳有良北亞區首席風險官啊，陳生。

138
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:37,780
OCB匯豐行has actually submitted its written submission on the the views about the the proposed lag rules. We are generally supportive of implementing lag rules in Hong Kong, especially given the the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. We have we shared similar concerns with.

139
00:26:41,410 --> 00:27:01,420
leg rules for the smaller banks. Hence, in our proposal, we have actually suggested to provide additional filter on what is a scope of applicability of our leg rules. We have quoted an example of a deposit market share of not exceeding three percent as a as a benchmark, instead of 150 billion.

140
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:21,430
然後，asset size， we shall capture many of the smaller banks in Hong Kong。我 have nothing further to add。Thank you， Chairman。Okay，唔該曬阿阿陳風險官啊。咁誒，跟住落嚟就係招商永隆銀行有限公司嘅張仲強財務總監啊。張生，聽。Good morning， Chairman and honourable誒，Negotiated Council。

141
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:20,190
Under section two point six of the draft code of practice on resolution planning LAC requirement, the HKMA consider that the long viability of any local incorporated AIS with total consolidated asset of more than one hundred and fifty billion Hong Kong dollar will be likely to pose a risk to the.

142
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:54,290
The proposed threshold of 150 billion Hong Kong dollar is only 0.6% of the total assets of all AIs in Hong Kong, which is considered very small. AIs with such insignificant market share would be small in size and simple in operation, and should not be regarded as systemically

143
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:26,050
Small bank has already been required required to incur significantly increased compliance costs as a result of the imposition of Basel III regulation. Imposing LAC requirement on small bank would further increase their compliance costs as they are required to issue higher cost LAC debt.

144
00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:12,660
到global systemic important bank and domestic systemic important banks，G級和D級，if HKMA would like to cover certain non-G級 or non-D級 in the wide group，it is suggested to increase the threshold to 600 billion Hong Kong dollar.

145
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:04,520
係。

146
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,770
冇喺其他地區係比較。

147
00:30:51,740 --> 00:31:05,430
Expected to be classified as West Russian entity and material subsidiary by 1 January 2020, and so will need to meet their respective LA requirement by 1 January 2022.

148
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:41,220
imposition of T-LAC requirement, imposing a T-LAC requirement in Hong Kong when others in the region are planning to do so on a slower timetable would put banks in Hong Kong at a competitive disadvantage.

149
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:51,740
Second, timeline for meeting LAC requirements should be in line with other country in the region and the parents' home regulator. We looked at the present intention is to classify resolution entities or material subsidiaries of law EMGZ in 2019. The other relevant entity.

150
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:26,020
The implementation schedule seems quite fast when compared with other country in the region. Australia just issue a discussion paper and is estimated to implement TLE in 2023. Mainland had not yet fixed their implementation time schedule. Certain countries such as Singapore are still pending on the

151
00:31:41,760 --> 00:32:01,770
In addition, the implementation should be in line with the parent home regulator as far as possible. As for our Chinese banks, the LAC debt instrument issued by the Hong Kong subsidiary will most likely be subscribed by our parent in the mainland. It will then require our parent bank to.

152
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:21,780
In parallel, similar LAC debt instrument to avoid capital deduction at its solo level. However, mainland have not yet announced the time schedule for implementing such LAC requirement and the treatment of holding of such instrument. It is estimated that it is most likely to implement after 2020.

153
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:41,790
Therefore, it is expected that the HKMA should kindly consider this factor to bring forward LAC requirement to Chinese banks to keep in line with the timeline of their parent home regulator. Thank you, chairman.好，唔該曬張總監。咁誒，我諗而家我想請即係政府當局咧，誒，我諗兩方面。

154
00:32:41,790 --> 00:33:01,800
噉樣啦。第一個就係其實委員會上次都有三個誒意見，希望你哋解釋。咁啱啱有銀行界嘅代表喺度，不如你都可以順便介紹埋啦。第二個咧就請你哋回應下頭先誒，即係與會嘅團體代表嘅幾個觀點。我唔知你哋可唔可以？第一個就係關於嗰個啊，我首先咧想同個。

155
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:21,810
委員講嚇，今日我哋而家審緊咧，就係嗰個規定rules。但係頭先好多銀行界代表反映嘅一條門檻咧，一千五百億呢個咧就擺落佢哋嘅實務守則code of practice裏邊嘅。咁所以咧就誒，我哋都要搞清楚佢佢而家即係金管局實行。

156
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:41,820
嗰時咧，我哋個rules時間，我哋今日會審或者係將來會審係一一套嘢啦。另外，大家銀行界反映得好熱烈嗰個咧，其實就仲有一個就係金管局自己會發嘅code of practice，噉就喺度做緊一個諮詢嘅，噉係係噉樣樣。噉我諗誒，頭先銀行代表咧有講過一個係誒，你哋。

157
00:33:41,820 --> 00:34:01,830
喺實務守則裏邊提到嘅一個門檻啦，而家係零點六個percent啦。咁有啲代表我聽到係兩個percent、三個percent、二點五個percent都有嘅。噉我希望你哋亦都回應下啦。亦都有提到E.M.E.G.十喺內地嗰個實施時間啦，有提到嗰個誒實施嘅時間表有冇可以？

158
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,230
OK。

159
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,410
啲具體啲嘅回應。

160
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,010
或者我首先。

161
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,340
The rules themselves do not automatically set lack requirements.

162
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,710
審議嘅呢一個誒附屬法例，其實係誒制定關於lock嘅一個規則。

163
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:47,030
銀行咧就係誒因應自己誒集團裏邊或者係銀行個別嘅情況咧，誒希望金管局有啲彈性嘅處理。噉我想講呢個正正咧就係處置機制嘅一個特色。

164
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:22,640
去檢視佢嘅情況，然之後根據佢嘅情況制定佢最即係有效嘅一個處置方式，或者係佢需要誒遵守嗰個誒吸收虧損能力係應該係點樣做。

165
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:21,840
比較多啲嘅彈性啦，誒另外亦都好多誒中小型銀行都講話誒，你其實行resolution plan或者係strategy都會用咗好多資源，有冇考慮我哋香港嘅競爭力啦？咁競爭力呢個問題亦都係包括埋喺誒，如果所有銀行都統一或一要發誒leg instrument嗰。

166
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:41,850
時咧會唔會對香港嘅金融誒競爭力有影響啦？亦都有銀行提到咧，就誒講叻嗰時應該係考慮佢嘅legal form，唔係一個accounting standard啦。咁呢個因為都好technical，我我請你哋都回應下啦。噉就誒另外亦都有講話集團誒可能有啲業。

167
00:34:44,200 --> 00:35:04,210
佔比重嘅噉係咪應該先考慮實施本地誒集團其他地區嘅可以放慢一啲咧？噉我誒drop低嘅point就喺度啦。噉我請啊張秘書長同埋金管局啊啊Mister Amon Wright可以，或者係Mister Robert Probin，你哋可以誒先回應一下先，好冇？唔該。

168
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:27,300
講幾個整體嘅回應先啦。嗱，誒即係觀乎頭先誒代表誒所提及嘅意見，咁誒其實有幾樣嘢都係誒共通嘅。誒第一就係嗰個門檻嘅問題。咁正如頭先主席誒都有總結，其實誒我哋而家喺呢個小組委員會。

169
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:54,000
咁呢一個其實係誒幫誒呢一個規則制定一個框架，咁而至於喺呢個框架之下有乜嘢嘅誒金融機構會被歸類為處置實體，呢一個咧就係誒由誒金管局即將會誒出嘅一個實務手則。

170
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:14,010
誒裏邊具體作一啲誒，即係佢哋基於咩考量，有啲乜嘢具體嘅門檻嚟界定嘅。咁嗰個實務守則咧，而家金管局咧由十月十九號開始做緊公誒諮詢緊業界。噉我亦都當然歡迎業界即係多啲向金管局反映，即係你哋個別嘅考慮同埋個別嘅意。

171
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:34,020
見噉，我相信金管局誒收取呢啲意見之後咧，會仔細考慮，然之後先至會落實呢一個守則嘅。咁今日呢個會其實都係一個好好嘅機會，等金管局可以即係直接收取大家嘅意見。我相信佢哋已經聽到啦。咁第二咧就係誒時間表誒同埋有個別銀。

172
00:36:47,310 --> 00:37:07,320
佢本身就係要求誒處置當局咧，係要就住個別金融機構嘅情況，每一間銀行做一個處置嘅即係規劃。咁所以咧，呢個框架制定咗之後咧，即係Lacros呢個框架制定咗之後咧，金管局就可以同個別銀。

173
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,210
covered by the D.P.S. protection.

174
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,070
Same views on the 150 billion threshold.

175
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:48,610
those who are not covered by the DPS could lose access to their funds for years during the insolvency process.

176
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:55,090
elaboration on the MA's consideration of the threshold on this issue, I think we see the sort of systemic importance as a spectrum.

177
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:41,710
但The DPS does not cover all deposits, nor all funds. If an entity fails, is not resolvable and goes into liquidation.

178
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:08,300
The resolution already has considered these factors in work in identifying the entities that are proposed to be within scope of the lack rules and identifying the one hundred and fifty billion threshold.

179
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:32,570
系統性風險和失敗是其規模的存單取款活動，這是一個非常重要的點。如果一個機構失敗且無法解決，所有存款人將面臨失去存款和帳户的風險，一段時間，直到DPS支票發放。

180
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:27,100
And we think that this this is a balance, and it tries to strike the right balance between protecting financial stability, and depositors in Hong Kong, and avoiding, insofar as is prudent, the imposition of onerous requirements on smaller institutions.

181
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:42,980
而時間表方面亦都係一樣，即係其實誒，當佢開始做呢一個誒，即係所謂firm-specific，即係一要因應個別金融機構做嘅呢一個功夫之後咧，其實佢都係需要花一段即係頗長嘅時間，先至可以完成到嘅。而佢做呢一個誒，即係工作。

182
00:37:42,980 --> 00:38:02,990
嘅過程之中咧，當然亦都要因應個別金融機構嗰個規模同埋系統重要性，逐間逐間去做嘅。咁所以即係誒，當可能誒即係大家誒，而且做嘅時候咧，亦都會因應個別情誒個別銀行嘅情況，佢可以喺誒符合。

183
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:23,000
要求嗰個時間表上面咧係有一有一定嘅彈性喺度嘅。咁另外咧就係有誒幾間銀行亦都提及，即係跨境協調嗰方面嘅工作。我想講呢個亦都係誒金管局會採採取嘅措施嚟嘅。咁而誒而家就我想請啊Mr. White誒去做一啲。

184
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:46,520
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman, honourable members and the banks here today. A number of issues were raised, so I hope you allow me around ten minutes, maybe, to address them. If that's all, that's okay. Okay, sure. And I think to just reiterate the point made by FSB, the LAC rules. What we're aiming to establish here is a framework for implementing LAC requirements for all.

185
00:38:51,620 --> 00:39:11,630
For that to happen, the HKMA needs to engage engage in resolution planning on a case-by-case basis with each individual institution, set a preferred resolution strategy based on a detailed understanding of that firm's position, and that's what these rules aim to facilitate. The rules themselves do not automatically set

186
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:31,640
The lack requirements. Now, the MA in deciding what criteria to take into account when determining which AIs are subject to the lack rules will consider a range of criteria, including the one hundred and fifty billion assets consolidated assets threshold discussed here today, and that has been set out in a draft code of practice.

187
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:51,650
Published by the MA, and again I really welcome the. We're here today to gather comments on that issue. We'd also actively encourage banks to contribute to the consultation process before it closes on the three rd of December this year. We'd welcome those submissions, in particular the.

188
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:15,360
But I think it's important. Maybe just give me a few minutes just to explain the MA's consideration of why that threshold is currently under consultation, and some of the factors that we've taken into account in setting out that threshold of one hundred and fifty billion. And I think the key issue here is we've examined the extent to which the.

189
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,420
instead。

190
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,850
Presentation to the resolution authority on that matter.

191
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,010
that are double capital requirements.

192
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,010
And for the meeting of lack requirements.

193
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,950
This would result in significant harm for those depositors not covered by the DPS.

194
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,190
The threshold represents a starting point for the resolution authorities' AI-specific resolution planning.

195
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:19,910
public as depositors and the wider economy, but in taking into account views on the 150 billion threshold.

196
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:50,890
However, for any entity that the failure of which would pose a risk to the financial stability of Hong Kong, it is appropriate that such an entity is resolvable, which is likely to require being subject to some lack requirements.

197
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:34,030
We recognise that banks here today have expressed a different view. As such, for banks below the 300 million billion threshold, the resolution authority is considering allowing a longer timeline for classification.

198
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:56,420
所以那係一個關鍵點，我諗我們想重申。另外，正如在諮詢草案的《操守守則》中所指出，裁決委員會會期望維持該門檻的審查。具體而言，裁決委員會會期望審查該門檻不低於每三至五年一次。

199
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:47,010
Only following the assessment of AI specific information and its individual circumstances, as well as formal decisions by the resolution authority to set a preferred resolution strategy and a designation under the LAC rules, would an AI need to comply with the LAC rules? Again, there's nothing automatic in the rules. Instead, it depends on case by case work.

200
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:35,370
不 viability of any locally incorporated AI, big and small, would likely pose a risk to the continued performance of critical financial functions, in particular, taking into account the extent of deposit-taking activities. So, in considering the 150 billion threshold, we've examined the number.

201
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:55,380
of depositors in individual banks, the volume of deposits, the number of transactional accounts, which is a particular measure of how reliant individuals are on regular access to their accounts for day-to-day payments. We've also examined carefully the number of depositors that are not fully

202
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:47,390
Now we recognise that some small banks here today that fall above the line may have different views. In particular, the argument has been made that entities that are not D-SIBs are not systemically important, and so should not be subject to the LAC requirements. Just to provide you a little bit further.

203
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:15,800
DSBs are those entities that are very top of that spectrum, whose disorderly failure would potentially have an extreme adverse impact on financial stability and the system as a whole. But the fact that an entity is not a DSB does not mean that it does not pose any systemic risk if it fails. We have said in the draft code of practice that a key measure of an entity.

204
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:15,240
The resolution authority must balance the interests of private banks who are subject to the LAC rules, and the general public's interest in depositor protection, in determining which institutions must be resolvable, and we should not sort of underplay the importance of LAC in protecting depositors.

205
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:35,250
所以我 think that's a key point that we'd like to highlight. But in determining any resolution strategy for an AI, the resolution authority will engage in detailed bilateral dialogue with with that institution. Under the rules, any entity that is proposed to be classified as a resolution entity or material subsidiary has the statutory right to make represent

206
00:43:51,170 --> 00:44:11,180
And as mentioned earlier, as a premier international financial centre, Hong Kong's economy benefits from a large banking sector. But the banking sector is very large in relation to Hong Kong's GDP compared to other jurisdictions. So we need to ensure that we have appropriate measures in place to maintain financial stability for the benefit of the sector.

207
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,540
在實踐。

208
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,030
for smaller AIs.

209
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,260
The larger AIs in this non-decid group.

210
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,270
會 lack requirements, therefore needing to be met no earlier than the 1st of July 2022.

211
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:07,560
所以，那最 earliest 分類日期 for AIs that are not DSBs，會 be the first of July 2020。

212
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:48,400
The resolution authority is prioritising DSBs in its resolution planning bilateral work, and in its classification processes.

213
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:38,860
所有嘅諦規則都係只係喺個個案個案嘅基礎上，所以有彈性喺度，畀MA去考慮到個公司嘅特定情況。

214
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,230
On timeline, all non-Chinese GSIBs are working to comply with the FSB's TLAC term sheet deadline of 2019.

215
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:09,940
Then the first of January two thousand and twenty-two onwards, and I'd like to emphasise that's the earliest point in which we're planning that any DSB in Hong Kong would be required to meet the lack rules.

216
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:59,460
The resolution already current intention is that DSBs will be classified around the 1st of January 2020, so that they would have to start meeting lock requirements no earlier.

217
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:33,650
Will be engaged in these bilateral discussions with the resolution authority, well before those AIs that are only just above the 150 billion threshold. So in practice, they are likely to have more time.

218
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:48,000
before classification and more time to meet the lack requirements. So I hope that sort of we've sort of heard the timing points, and I think we wanted to provide better clarity on our planning assumptions and that clarification on timing.

219
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:17,380
那那係 sort of key points I think on the threshold. There's a couple of other important points I'd like to address, particularly on flexibility within the lack rules to take into account case case specific circumstances and the position of smaller AIs. So it's important to note that having assets above 150 billion threshold does not imply that an AI will automatically be required to meet lack.

220
00:45:47,370 --> 00:46:07,380
And specifically for smaller AIs above the one just near but above the one hundred and fifty billion threshold, lack requirements could be reduced by up to fifty percent of the resolution component ratio if the AI's resolution strategy envisages a partial property transfer or a whole bank transfer, and this is likely to be most relevant.

221
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:39,590
Therefore, under the rules, they can be required to meet Lac requirements three months after classification. They are probably facilitating compliance with the compliance of their relevant Hong Kong operations with the FSB's TLAC 2019 timeline. All other AIS will have 24 months following classification.

222
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:30,230
Of course, the MA has the flexibility to take into account firm specific circumstances. Whether that is to provide more time for that institution to issue the lack requirement, taking into account the market circumstances at the time, and that will be done on a case by case basis. All

223
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:59,710
This date is the very earliest. Any AI besides the non-Chinese GSEs will be required to meet lack requirements in Hong Kong. However, to provide clarity to the market for all non-GSEs, not just those below the 300 billion Hong Kong dollar mark, the resolution authority's intention is to stagger the classification of such entities.

224
00:48:48,920 --> 00:49:08,930
咁因為時間關係咧，我想都畀誒，因為趁團體喺度咧，就畀啊我哋嘅委員發問咗先。咁不如我等委員都誒先發問咗先。第一位委員係阿陶瑾新誒議員，唔該。好誒，主席就誒誒唔好意思，因為我咧本嚟誒誒十點半咧要去一個巡視咧，同啲非議員去。

225
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,500
個問題就係。

226
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,120
可能噉樣同我哋講嘅。

227
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,420
我唔係話佢哋係壞人。

228
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,990
不過，你有嘢就好講啦。

229
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,870
低到噉樣都都要搞嘅。

230
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:51,220
因為咧，你要講得我哋明咧，係好具體，我知道你講嘅乜，邊樣嘢唔掂。

231
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:21,440
但係咧，我好坦白講，對我立法者，我立咗廿幾年法，我乜嘢唔同嘅範疇，我點會唔知道官僚點樣諗嘢？

232
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:44,940
因為咧嗱，我唔係叫你好似我噉樣啊，即係可能我啲夥係反對派，我哋啊，即係啊比較唔同嘅態度啦嚇，嗰個聲調啊噉，但但係咧。

233
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:18,270
喺西區，所以我咧就好關心呢條標，我就好多謝咁多位銀行界嘅朋友咧嚟表達。咁尤其是咧，就我係確實咧係。

234
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:38,850
坦白講，主席剛才講話誒，我唔係嗰啲咧，就誒跟住咧就係個實務守則。哇，對唔住主席，我我我知道呢啲嗰個唔同嘅letter，咁擺喺邊度點樣？

235
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:32,090
噉我我就奇怪啦！噉啊，你搞死人嘅喎！我呢個同原本嘅大例咧，同我原本嗰個諗法咧，通過你大例嘅時候咧，係完全唔係呢套嘢嚟嘅喎。

236
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:16,820
咁犀利，嗰啲銀行咧係重點招呼啊！咁呢個冇辦法咧，我哋應承全世界一齊打聯防啊嘛。但係而家你搞搞下，搞到咧就係係又搞，唔係又搞，最細嗰啲即係我覺得俗啲，即係唔好意思啊，我冇得罪你哋嚇啊，即係。

237
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:35,380
啊，有啲驚訝啦，就係我啊聽到啊，尤其是中小型銀行啦，咁講啦嘅意見咧，就啊其實都幾強烈嘅。當然你哋咧係用你嘅措辭，已經好温和啊，我聽得出。咁但係我第一件事咧，我就係希望你哋唔好太婉轉啦。

238
00:49:51,870 --> 00:50:11,880
有時我覺得監管局嗰個角度咧，佢好簡單，佢一樣嘢咧，佢覺得佢一切咧從自己嗰個啊合宜嘅角度啦、行政方便啦，甚至佢覺得自己咧將會係好合理對待你哋嘅啊，好講道理嘅。誒case by case，你唔點咧，我都畀時間你嘅。OK，嗱佢。

239
00:50:40,790 --> 00:51:00,800
我哋原本立嗰個主例嘅時候，個講法嗰個大嘅原則就係話：，喂，有啲銀行大到唔掂咧，即係死嘅喎。咁哦，噉啊，國長話：，喂，噉我哋一齊要搞搞搞啲嘢，搞搞掂佢，唔係一齊死嘅喎。咁咁其實嗰陣時咧，個針對重點咧就係啲會影響全石全球啊，啊，甚至影響香港，而香港影響全球啦。啊，我哋噉。

240
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:52,690
當然，如果你話大吉利是在在呢度所有嘅夾埋個個都係一個percent嘅啫啊誒冇添啊，可能噉啊夾埋曬咧唔止啦啊夾埋曬就有十幾percent啦咁喂。如果佢哋一齊死咁咪會唔會一齊令冧咧噉樣？仲有喎，有啲大銀行又唔冧喎，佢哋一齊死嘅啫咁噉我。

241
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,280
即係先係複合。

242
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,970
因為講掂數先。

243
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,700
如果唔係，搞唔掂㗎，真係。

244
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,900
要要求你哋，餵你哋都要。

245
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,610
你J.R.話唔通點J.R.啊，大佬？

246
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:07,020
唔好意思，你都有大學生嘅優，OK啊，眾人都大啲啊，咁但係咧。

247
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:02,700
頂住啦，一齊係嘛，整整啲資產嚟到啊！咁但係我心諗呢個永遠都係風險為本估計係咪？

248
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:42,570
咁所以希望咧，第一件事，主席，所有呢啲觀點咧，希望金管局咧係政府咧詳細用書面答。

249
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:53,680
唔講掂數，令到人哋擔驚受怕，唔好話講幾多廿四個月，一三六個月，仲話度身訂造，而你就想通過呢個例咧？對唔住，我第一個我就一定反對咗呢個先。

250
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:33,560
哎呀！我哋好安全嘅噉樣，我哋安全過全球啲銀行嘅，我都知啦，大佬係嘛？噉你講到呢邊就好安全，然後到嗰陣時咧，你就講到咧就係話我哋喂佢可能一齊唔安全咧噉，喂噉我真係覺得呢呢件嘢好奇怪嘅。

251
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:41,500
嚇！即係係係唔掂啊！嗱，我我知道你都唔可唔會講到你自己好唔掂啊！哇！你你畀誒五年我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年，我都遵守唔到，但係你唔知佢誒誒誒五年

252
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:17,140
好啦，如果你講到乜嘢都去到嗰個誒實務守則，然後就逐個同你講，喂，我坦白講，我同你啲銀行講聲，你無險可守啊？點啊？你最尾佢等佢佢覺得好合理，你覺得唔合理，噉你兩個簡單啫。

253
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:42,570
噉你如果嗰陣時先講咧，就死得㗎啦！話畀你聽，記住，我冇你哋啲銀行股啊嚇，我check清楚先。我存款係有，應該就冇啊。OK啊，咁所以咧，我覺得咧就係如果你嗰個税務守則係嗰條線畫到係我哋覺得大致上唔妥當嘅咧，而你想話你唔。

254
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:19,990
我而家我睇上嚟啦，當然啦，佢哋咧永遠都唔會講到自己就嚟死嘅大佬啊。佢乜嘢冧啊？個擠提咪死係嘛？梗係唔會啦。但係而家你講嘅呢個係好大鑊嘅時候，需要去注資啊，頂住嘅時候咧。喂，好老實講，你你夾佢哋都夾到個個啲資本要求啊，嗰啲幾多percent？你自己必個總裁出嚟呢度講啊！

255
00:53:42,860 --> 00:54:02,870
因為只有詳細專篇答，而亦都有機會咧，畀翻今日出席嘅朋友咧，佢亦都可以再畀submission。嗱，你唔好客氣啊，真係啊，我唔係我唔係煽動你去對抗佢啊，而係呢樣嘢咧，你係代表咩？代表你好多員工，代表好多咧有係希望幫助小銀行嘅客户，唔受嗰啲大銀行。

256
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:27,450
呢個希望你明白，我哋講道理嘅。O.K.呢度其他同事咧，佢好多建制派嘅。O.K.佢哋都講道理嘅，佢亦都明白你哋嘅處境，但係直接啲啊，因為咧有啲嘢咧，我我我我我睇完，譬如我睇完，哇咁婉轉嘅，噉你咁講究竟係得咧唔得咧？係係你講廿四個月咧，幾多咧咁？

257
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,240
發行新股啊！叫股東再集資啊！

258
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:55,810
Thank you, and and thank you, Mr Patel.

259
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:53,170
定點啊！定將所有轉轉嫁喺啲我哋啲小傳户嗰度啊！我我唔知喎，真係係嘛噉，所以咧，你行國際協議。

260
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:41,480
Scope of the FiRO is not limited to banks above 150 billion in assets. Instead, as considered by Legco, the FiRO applies to all AIS.

261
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:10,990
I think the one of the objectives for the HKMA today was to ensure that there was a consultation outstanding on the 150b billion threshold to inform the discussion here today on the rules.

262
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:49,440
激惡或者激動，我只係咧係真係好關心呢單嘢咧，係要講清楚個位喺邊度，個平衡喺邊度，就係咁多啫。好，好，啊唔該曬。誒，首先我諗請當局回應下阿陶議員嘅嘅一個關注先啦，好唔好啊？

263
00:54:53,460 --> 00:55:13,470
大家世界打聯防，保障香港安全係重要嘅。但係我希望你明白，而家咧，我我起碼我今日聽完之後咧，哇！我諗啊，喂，你啲意見有冇畀過佢嘅咧？如果你係啞音啞音到依家先講，又好奇怪。如果你之前講咗畀佢聽嘅，佢就上一次仲同我哋講，仲話唔係。

264
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:33,480
係喎，同你傾過曬，好好喎嗰個諮詢嚇進展，好好我先嚟嚟嚟立法會條標啦噉啊！噉我心諗發生咩事咧？係咪係咪你忍住唔講咧？係咪佢誤導我哋咧？我而家都搞唔清嗰個gap點解喺邊度？點解今日就盡盡訴心中情嘅咧？噉係嘛？主席啊，唔好意思，我大聲唔表示係誒。

265
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:31,420
We thought it was very important to enable legislative members to assess the rules, but also to provide an opportunity for banking sector representatives to understand how the MA planned to apply the rules before the rules were finalised. So it was, we think it's very important to be transparent about how we.

266
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:51,430
plan to take forward our work, and we look forward to the consultation responses on the code of practice and the 150 billion threshold, which is currently not not a finalised or set number. So, and we are, I think, what we want to say today is that we are listening to the feedback that we are receiving from banking sector representatives, and we will consider the.

267
00:56:51,430 --> 00:57:11,440
feedback that we receive before the end of the consultation process。但但係，Mr. Wright，我想講咧就係誒，最緊要咧係要address到啊陶議員嘅其中一個困商，因為嗱，你哋想我哋立法會過呢個Leg Rules，但係Co-op Practice咧就十二月先完嗰個諮詢期噉。

268
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:31,450
中間有一個time lag啦，噉我哋過咗之後，你個諮詢期之後，你你保留翻係一千五百億定係你提高，我哋係冇辦法知道㗎嘛。咁阿陶議員嘅問題就係話：，喂，你唔嗰度講得清清楚楚，而家今日聽完，你大約個方向係點行咧？佢好。

269
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,750
this would allow them longer to prepare to meet the requirements.

270
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,950
under the FARO are required in order to protect.

271
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:21,220
Regime to apply where the failure of a bank would be expected to pose a risk to financial stability.

272
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:09,860
As my colleague has already said, we are happy to consider a longer implementation timeline for banks under a threshold of 300 billion.

273
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:58,510
金融穩定，所以，啊，the the HKMA's considered view is that a 150 billion threshold is the correct indicative threshold from which to start.

274
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:53,560
Practice, so I stop there. Okay, Robert, you want to supplement a little bit, right? Yes, thank you. So in relation to Mr. To's question, and if I correctly understood some of the points coming out of the deputation.

275
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:40,660
Having assessed each individual firm's circumstance, so I think that's a really important point. The legislation is broader than what we are proposing here today, and we think this reflects the MA's judgement of those firms that are most likely to present a risk if they fail out and enter liquidation.

276
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:20,500
to take into account those circumstances for small firms, but specifically on the code of practice proposes that it is only instruments that are accounted for as liabilities and not those accounted for as equity that should count towards minimum debt requirements. However, the resolution authority is actively considering the details of this issue.

277
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:51,460
好難叫佢去支持，或者其他誒委員啦，我哋議員去支持話呢個leg rule就冇問題，可以畀你過。即係佢嘅concern係呢度。咁點可以address嗰個嗰個？我唔會過呢個rule。係啊係啊，即係即係呢一樣嘢。即係我明頭先誒啊，Mr. Wright，你都reiterate咗你哋成個process或者你哋嘅一個。

278
00:57:51,460 --> 00:58:11,470
諗法，但係我諗阿陶議員嘅諗法就係話：餵，你嗰個係十二月，你先最尾出嚟喎。你而家係要我批呢個？簡單講咧，你你等佢哋翻政府翻去諗下，有冇法早啲能夠令到我哋喺通過呢個rules之前，起碼我作為議員啦，我唔我唔係淨係要考慮嗰啲銀行嘅利益，而係再一個平衡。呢個係咪一個？

279
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:31,480
合適嘅位，我哋可以通過咧噉。嗯，係啦，即係。但係如果今日咁講咧，我對唔住，我哋通過唔到嘅真係嚇。即係嗰個point係呢度嚇。我唔知阿Mr. Wright你會唔會有啲諗法可以address到呢一個point咯嚇。Yeah. Um, so I guess I go back to the primary legislation, the fire, and the

280
00:58:41,880 --> 00:59:01,890
And all financial institutions within the scope of the FIRO. So in that sense, what we're providing here today, and what the lack rules under section 19 of the FIRO are allowed to encompass, are all AIs. What we're setting here today is an is a a set of priorities that define a subset, a smaller group.

281
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:22,140
Of institutions within what the fire provisions already allow, as as within scope proposed at least under the consultation that's currently ongoing, as proposed to be most likely subject to the lack rules. Again, not on an automatic basis, on a case by case basis, subject to formal decisions that will follow.

282
00:59:41,460 --> 01:00:01,470
Mr. Chairman, I have two more points I wanted to respond to in the deputations very briefly, and one with respect to the Chinese GSB operations in Hong Kong. I think we can very clearly state that, as part of home and host cross-border resolution planning best practice in making classifications and imposing any lack requirements.

283
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:21,480
In relation to any subsidiary in Hong Kong of a Chinese GSB, and indeed of any subsidiary of any bank headquartered outside of Hong Kong, the resolution authority will cooperate and coordinate with the relevant home authorities. So I can really, that's a core part of how we take the implementation of any resolution planning for across.

284
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:37,760
On failure, will not be subject to lack requirements.

285
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:06,170
第二啊，推行時間啦，噉啊，新加坡連日子都未定，我哋已經定咗出嚟咧，就係二零二二咧開始做，你開始做。

286
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:37,450
就會令到銀行經營困難，反而咧會削弱咗銀行嗰個實力嘅，就令到佢更加容易倒閉。噉啊就違反咗個政策原意嘅。

287
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:12,980
咁所以我冇停佢。我諗我哋大約每位先六分鐘到啦，好唔好？噉啊，陳建波議員先啦，唔該。都係主席嗱，我諗個法例嘅原意咧嗱，首先我申報先，我係東亞銀行嘅獨立非執行董事啊。

288
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:28,030
咁個法例原意就係要令銀行業穩定啦，令到政府唔需要咧，當銀行倒閉嗰時係要係誒即係付抄啦。咁但係如果不合理噉樣去推行呢一個誒政策咧，就一定會增加銀行不必要嘅經營成本嘅。

289
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:41,490
Cross-border bank forward, we will always be engaging and are actively engaging in cooperation with home authorities. And I can reassure the members here that in setting lack requirements for any foreign bank's operations, we will do that in a corded way with the home authorities. Okay. And finally, on the minimum death requirements point, I just like to clarify.

290
01:00:41,490 --> 01:01:01,500
The code of practice. Well, we recognise that meeting that requirement may create challenges, particularly for some small firms with limited debt issuance track record. To meet, so in such cases, the resolution authority would therefore consider whether it is appropriate to allow a longer implementation timeline.

291
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:40,790
Based on the ongoing dialogue with industry, and we welcome consultation feedback on this point. I think we're particularly open to the views expressed here today and the consultation feedback on this point specifically. So we're I think very happy to take that on board and consider how we can reflect it as part of the final code of.

292
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:13,850
I think the concern was raised that smaller, medium-sized banks would be subject to lack requirements, notwithstanding that they are not systemic and would not pose a risk to financial stability. So I just think it might be useful to clarify that the FIRO, the primary legislation, only allows the resolution.

293
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:41,760
In the the lack rules, the the HKMA does not have the resolution authority. Will not have the unfettered discretion to classify entities as resolution entities or material subsidiaries. It is only those entities for which the resolution planning indicates that stabilisation options.

294
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:34,090
But in addition, would also provide these smaller banks with the opportunity to demonstrate that should they fail, they would not pose any risk to financial stability, and so they could be safely allowed to go into insolvency. The bottom line is that any bank that is not anticipated to pose a risk to financial stability.

295
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:58,820
O.K.啊，我都讀一讀。我哋其實誒幾位委員都舉咗手想問嘢，噉我講一講個順序，等大家知道下啦嚇。誒，陳建波議員、梁繼昌議員、張華峯議員同阿盧偉國議員嘅咁誒。我諗頭先咧，因為阿陶錦新議員咧，佢講得好好好誒興致好好高啦。

296
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:58,110
咁咧嗱，香港即係當然，我哋香港係要跟國際嗰個標準去行啦。但係就唔應該採用世界世界上最嚴嗰一套啊。例如喺處置機制咧，美國都係應用於G涉啫，係嘛？你香港已經G涉D涉呢個做埋，你仲話連中小銀行都要搞埋咧，我諗就就好過分咧，都係冇需要。

297
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:26,460
噉啊，好似係好係好遲咧。但係其實你話，就算你畀人哋有啲容許嘅時間，你可能都係半年三個月已經好似黃恩大赦噉樣。其實咧，如果你話要將人斬頭，你遲一個時辰斬頭有咩分別咧？係嘛噉，所以最緊要話你啲條件係咪不合理先？你係咪真係嚴重影響啲銀行先？咁嗱，我頭先咧就我睇到咧冇乜。

298
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:46,470
真係大嘅國際性銀行今日出現啦，即係話佢哋可能都冇大問題啦。但係似乎中小銀行就好大咯，中小銀行全部喺曬度啦，係咪？咁所以我諗對佢哋係一個好好大，亦都係一個合理嘅憂慮。正如阿陶錦新議員講，其實如果今日過咗，將來過咗咧，其實嗰個corporate咧鬼咁辣咧，又冇改變咧，其實佢哋真係影響好大。

299
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:26,070
因素啦，同埋呢個時間表嘅啊，咁呢個呢個第一點。第二點咧就誒，呢個陳議員都講到咧，就話。

300
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:38,590
啊！阿王富恆鼎總裁，大新銀行嚇。陳阿王主席，係多謝誒各位議員誒陳議員嘅誒提問。噉我哋咧就誒覺得呢個所謂息率咧。

301
01:05:46,470 --> 01:06:06,480
所以佢哋，但係佢哋一向，因為我都做咗銀行好多年啦，銀行保險都係斯文人啦，所以就唔會講得即係好痛苦都唔會同你講話嗰個害係係話幾大。但係咧就嗰真係嗰個嚴重性係好大噉，所以咧嗱頭先金管局講得好清楚啊，佢哋係有一個好大嘅執行性嘅彈性。我希望佢哋真係有誠信去做得出。噉。

302
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:26,490
我覺得咧就政府要留意邊幾樣啊？咁第有幾樣要一定要留意？第一，你嗰個處置實體嗰個對象啊，係咪適當咧？噉樣係咪應該好似美國噉，淨係做資摺咧？淨係真係真真正正系統性國際性銀行先做咧嚇？D摺係咪應該做？噉我諗你要考慮啦，係嘛？第二嗰個。

303
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:46,500
時間升係咪過急咧？我哋係咪要做全世界第一咧？有冇需要咧？點解我哋唔同嘅競爭者，例如新加坡，甚至慢過新加坡？你點解我唔做？人哋連日子都仲未定。第三就係話個別銀行影響係咪過高咧？即係譬如我唔知有邊間可能你第日哇影響好大嘅，令到佢根本譬如我舉例啊，如果你令佢每年。

304
01:06:46,500 --> 01:07:06,510
年嘅盈利都少幾個percent，甚至十個percent，對佢公唔公道咧？係嘛？噉你個影響又又又會點咧？咁呢啲如果你有咁大彈性咧，你真係唔應該係即係浪費咗。人哋世界性嘅組織就係睇到每一個地方都唔同啊嘛，每一個地方嗰個儲備又唔同，嗰個銀行嘅能力又唔同，所以就畀個彈性你，你就唔好咧行到最。

305
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:26,520
辣嗰套喺香港係最興咁啦嚇，將全世界最辣嗰啲全部套喺香港，噉你做嘢監管機構容易做，但係你會監管死嗰啲畀你監管嗰啲人咧噉樣。咁咧嗱，因為咧其實而家我哋全球嘅經濟咧走向危機，而家香港嘅股市、樓市都大跌㗎啦，將來會我自己估計嚇。咁咧就同你二零一七年咧金

306
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:46,530
官佢做研究嗰時咧，個情況咧已經完全係不同嘅，包括嗰個社會經濟環境啦、利率啊、成本啦，全部都唔同。咁所以而家我想問一問誒各位在座嘅，即係趁各位代表喺度啦。嗱，政府畀立法會嘅文件入面有講咧，就話佢計你哋嗰個，即係話你要符合呢個leg requirement嗰個債務。

307
01:07:46,530 --> 01:08:06,540
冇成本咧，佢話估你四個percent噉樣。佢呢個係二零一七年做嘅，佢係當二零一七年啲誒持牌銀行交畀金管局嘅數字，就係話咧二級資本加權平均成本略低四個percent噉樣。噉我想問各位邊位可以答咧？就係話你估而家喺今時今日利息趨升，跟住喺幾年後？

308
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:26,550
波利率，你仲係咪四個percent咧？係咩percent咧？可唔可以有人勇敢話畀我聽係幾多啊？金管局唔會追究你，唔使驚嚇。你快啲話畀我聽，係咪邊位想答我呢個問題？係咯，誒，各位議會代表有冇啲估計嚇？因為即係我哋，我哋都睇到個文件就係四個percent嘅。噉我唔知你哋有冇你哋自己嘅估計啊？

309
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:58,880
係誒過於簡單啊！嚇，即係第一就利利利息就誒催升嘅啊。仲有咧，就如果話好多香港嘅銀行咧都要喺誒，你話二零二二啊，或者二零二三咧都要去誒發行噉嘅新嘅債券咧啊，同埋呢啲會係需要。

310
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:18,890
要build in啊，特別嘅條款咧，市場都要仲要發展啊，仲要適應。咁而家其實冇一個直接可以作比較嘅，咁所以咧，我嘅睇我哋嘅睇法咧，其實嘅息率咧就四個percent應該偏低啊。究竟係咪應該誒出於五個percent嗰邊咧，或者甚至更高咧？其實都會睇將來市場嗰個環境啦，市場嗰個。

311
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:46,520
係呢個誒，對於我哋講緊而家針對係中小嘅銀行個影響啦，嚇對可能盈利啊，對誒向呢個市場、向呢個客户啊、中小企啊啊同埋各種誒客户嘅服務咧啊個影響。噉我想補充下咧，就其實誒我哋嘅睇法咧就。

312
01:09:46,520 --> 01:10:06,530
誒增加呢方面嗰個誒所謂叻嗰個誒liability啦嚇，咁金管局誒都向大家可能講起啊，其實即係嗰個誒考慮咧就可以循序進展，誒進一步步嚟，咁可以咧就話係以誒一點五誒或者去到。

313
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,780
個比率係幾多咧？係九十九個percent。

314
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:48,500
誒，而第二點關於嗰個誒。

315
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:14,830
明白點解政府不能夠將呢個門檻擺喺個rules入邊嘅schedule嗰度？

316
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:26,020
誒第三點，我要指出咧，誒我我諗。

317
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:43,730
同佢你高，大家你高啲，咁到時你咪把呢個schedule five喺度set out個門檻咯，可能千五億、二千億、三千億，呢個第一點我我想講。

318
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:19,890
旗下，亦話你哋係喺根據call practice有可能將個廿四月可能調價到三十六個月啊，四十八月，depending on即係銀行嗰個啊風險。

319
01:13:50,350 --> 01:14:08,960
都你都提過就係我哋嘅cover practice其實就喺呢條rule之後過咗，即係蘇州過後冇聽答㗎啦。我哋而家唔講咧，你將來點樣去做咧？都即係就算我諗，即係各位呢度與會朋友有咩反對，都係你哋同即係MA自己去去去即係周旋嘅，到時。

320
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:26,540
兩倍噉，但係可能咧就中小銀行咧，相信就會係起步喺一點五倍喺佢哋喺我哋嘅核心個資本個要求啊個總個叻嘅嘅需求啦嚇。咁而家咧基本上咧，但係講中小銀行咧，佢哋我哋嘅資本充足比率大大概係接近十八個percent度。係，sorry，繼續啊，我我補。

321
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:46,550
都買得好快啲，咁咁如果話要增加一點五倍咧，即係誒去即係用個less嘅requirement嚟計算啦嚇。我哋睇到咧呢個相關嘅less嘅比率咧，相對於個誒我哋講緊係誒即係經風險嚇即係調節嘅資產啦，我哋叫risk。

322
01:10:46,550 --> 01:11:06,560
asset咧嗰個比率咧，大概應該最少都接近二十一個percent嘅。咁即係話咧，我哋要增加咧嗰個相關嘅債務咧，相等於我哋風險資產咧係有三個percent或者或者再以上啦。咁呢個講緊咧，如果睇緊二零二至二零二二三嗰啲時間，我而家向前睇，用中小銀行一個綜綜合。

323
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:26,570
誒平均嚟睇緊而家嗰個佢個資產誒，或者係佢個負債個規模咧，可能講緊涉及嗰個相關嘅債務啊。佢叻嘅債務咧係係唔係講得少嘅，係講緊好多十個億啊，或者咧至到超過係一百至到二百個億嘅。

324
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:46,580
哦，好睇有啲銀行規模發展幾快同埋幾大啦。即係呢個唔係講緊一個好細嘅金額啊。咁相關嚟講咧，對於個成本咧，相對於而家中信銀行咧，而家講緊可能每年賺緊係大概誒，即係講緊係十個億至到二十個億咁講啊。我哋講緊將來如果用緊呢個誒。

325
01:11:46,580 --> 01:12:06,590
又要發行噉嘅債務同埋嗰個成本咧，可能講緊好幾個億或者以上嘅影響㗎啊！我想相信咧，就向議員同埋向金股講作出呢個噉嘅陳述咧，就係我哋真係睇緊呢個個影響同埋個成本方面咧，係頗為大嘅啊！我哋聽到金股就話啊，我哋時間。

326
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:26,600
表可能有彈性啦，逐個咧可能會再傾啦啊，或者係個要求咧，再睇翻各種個發展啦。但係嗰啲例一定落嚟，同埋個實務守則以金管局去去操作去實行嘅話咧，以而家提議出嚟用一千五百億嘅總資產作為起步點咧，點樣兩三年、三幾年調節得好咧？其實。

327
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:46,610
真係偏低嘅，仲有仲有補充一點咧，就話咧，相對於香港廿二間即係本地啊設立嘅銀行啦，而家提議緊一千五百億作為總資產作為起步點咧，就係涉及嗰啲銀行所誒持有嘅資產，相對於呢廿二間銀行嘅總資產。

328
01:12:50,320 --> 01:13:10,330
O.K.，即係話咧，係我哋而家涉及嗰個層面係涉及嘅銀行咧，所經營嘅業務範疇嚇嗰啲以一千五百億而家嘅資產或啲以上嘅個別銀行咧，從小型銀行去到大銀行咧，總體嚟講係會納入呢個噉嘅leg嘅誒誒。

329
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:30,340
要求之內咧，我哋涉及資產咧就講九十九percent。咁好多國家嚟講咧，呢個講緊係D級啊，最大型嗰啲啦，甚至係D級。咁所以咧呢個層次，我哋覺得咧都係誒去得比較深同埋闊嘅，同埋時間咧都係過急嘅。好，誒我畀阿陳議員跟進少少。啊，如果你容許，因為我唔想阻其他同事啊，你容許我第二輪嘅話。

330
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:50,350
我畀好，好會會。噉我二輪再問啊。好啊，咁下一位係阿梁繼昌議員，唔該。誒，聽咗咁多位同事同埋各位議會者嗰啲意見咧，我諗我有我有三大點嘅。第一點咧就頭先金管局同小講咗，你嗰啲所謂彈性處理等等咧，誒都係會擺喺個code practice度。噉啊，主席你？

331
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:24,200
仲有一樣嘢咧。

332
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:22,300
究竟，比如每十億嘅或者五億嘅每或一每一億嘅leveraged instrument，其實你嘅估計嘅成本喺唔同嘅interest rate嘅底下會幾多咧？計埋曬啲click-clack嘢，我都想知嘅，唔知有冇啲補充資料可以畀到啦？呢個呢個我未問完啊！

333
01:17:44,670 --> 01:18:00,810
買翻曬對方嘅，我又唔知你哋有冇一個prohibition話唔畀，唔畀嘅，唔畀嘅，唔畀嘅，一定保險公司同銀行都唔準，唔唔準作hold。咁好啦，香港啦，噉你喺外邊嘅銀行或者保險公司咧，外國可唔可以hold香港嗰啲咧？

334
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:59,480
唔可以寫喺條rule入邊個schedule嗰度啦，主席啊。好，誒，首先我想問誒銀行嘅代表咧，有冇人想回答啊梁議員咧？關於一億大約你個involve嘅成本係幾多？有冇人想答先？如果冇咧，噉我就將佢嘅問題先由政府嗰邊，係啦，係啦。

335
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:29,380
噉我睇翻條條rules，當然我我主體法例當然係誒可以令到金管局係即係對誒所有AI即係author institution都有一個權力去去apply呢個lab rule，但係咧當然你而家係要即係根據翻個風險同埋實際情況咧去定下究竟我哋。

336
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:49,390
個門檻係幾多嗱？我亦都聽到頭先跟本哥嘅同事啊，Mr. White講過咧，佢哋每三年至五年係會去檢討呢個門檻嘅嗱。呢個門檻係緊要嘅。噉你而家定咗一千五百億個資產總值，當然你喺三年之後真真正實行嗰時候，呢個數都可能已經改變咗，亦都會。

337
01:14:49,400 --> 01:15:09,410
噉我哋擔心就係話，究竟呢個一千五百億究竟係咪一個誒，太過即係risk averse嘅一個估計？咁當然亦都我啲同事都聽到同事講話，喂，呢條rules乜都冇嘅，正之後個call先會擺咗喺喺度，好多嘢都，我就唔。

338
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:35,210
咁到時你哋話要改啊提高或者降低都點都要走翻嚟立法會走一轉，雖然係係會用咗些少時間。我覺得你把呢個schedule five喺個rules度咧set out翻嗰個門檻咧，我覺得比較實際啲，對於我哋各位議員安心啲。噉你話而家同

339
01:15:48,780 --> 01:16:08,790
即係彈性，即係係咪誒得二十四個月時間？噉我又聽到話，喂，如果有啲即係誒A.I.要多些少時間去去做嘅時候，金管局係會畀多多啲時間。我我唔知呢個二十四個月係咪你你一定係係係噉樣嘅一個誒法例上規定咗嘅一個。

340
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:46,550
叻嘅instrument嘅發行咧，其實對銀行有啲咩成本咧？我睇到除咗嗰個誒利息之外啦，當然利息可能有啲人話係projection四個percent、五個percent甚至六個percent，我哋不知道嘅呢樣嘢。咁當然而家啲利息咧係係可以扣税嘅，咁都係即係。

341
01:16:46,550 --> 01:17:06,560
冇咗個十六點五percent嘅啫。咁其實除咗嗰個利息之外咧，其實仲有發行嘅誒成本啦，Issuing Cost啦。其實你仲有誒marketing嘅成本啦，其實仲有一個合規嘅成本等等嘅。其實都都有其他嘅成本喺入邊嘅。其實對於銀行嚟講，我我諗我都想知道銀行即係有冇估計到。

342
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:44,670
喺上一次嘅會入邊，亦都好多嘅我哋嘅誒誒小組委員會嘅同事講咗，究竟let instrument嗰個市場係邊啲人去去去買呢啲instrument咧？如果你哋銀行之間互相互hold翻大家let instrument咧，其實呢個係一個systematic risk嘅，即係話香港啲銀行自己。

343
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:21,100
又唔畀嘅，咁如果咁唔畀之下咧，咁有咩人咧？我哋啲小小投資者更加唔會，又唔準啦。咁真係雞雞埋埋咧，我諗真係有個大問題。所以嗰個廿四月三六嘅四十八月咧，我諗即係一定係要即係諗一諗啊！我諗即係金管局，即係呢。

344
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:41,110
啲三大問題嘅啫，都係即係有一部分問題可能議會真係答到，有啲可以誒金管局而而家都答到，但係我都希望啊主席，你要求翻誒政府同埋金管局咧，畀翻一個詳細嘅文件，係set out翻呢啲答案畀我哋嚇。唔該，我最緊要嗰樣係點解我嗰個誒門檻點解唔？

345
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,880
instead，the rules apply to all AIs.

346
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,260
Tailored approach, take into account firm-specific circumstances.

347
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:04,140
for certain firm-specific circumstances.

348
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,910
around the cost of that and how we factored that into the consultation process.

349
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:16,960
historical data. None of us can tell with perfect accuracy what costs will be in the future.

350
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:20,650
I would echo the same point. I think that's a key point. We've emphasised that the rules provide a framework.

351
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:12,710
誒，即係被實施一個light requirement嘅一個確切嘅門門檻，噉係會因應個別情況而調節嘅。噉我請兩位同事亦都可以作一啲具體嘅補充。

352
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:37,070
and the reason that and there's nothing automatic in the rules in setting lack requirements, that's very important because the risk of having automatic requirements set out in the rules mean that it would impose a one size fits all approach.

353
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:20,840
啊啊，都係啊，王副行政總裁，你你請講。我簡單講講咧，就誒頭先誒講到話有關誒開發即係發出嘅成本啊，或者叫E-Cost啊、Marketing啊，同埋Compliance Cost咧，呢個呢個係好好真實嘅。咁相對於一億嚟講，或者係甚至係再大啲嘅發行金。

354
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:40,850
金額咧就可能誒嗰個唔係一個簡單一個好單一嘅比率嘅嚇咁誒。其實咧就對於誒中資銀行嚟講咧，其實更加處於不利嘅位置啊，因為點解咧？我哋可能要去做roadshow嗰啲啦嚇，我哋要去誒做呢個評級啦。其實咧，你大細咧，其實都係要。

355
01:19:40,850 --> 01:20:00,860
要噉嘅成本啊，咁相對如果相對嘅誒價嗰個成本其實仲高嘅啊，咁所以咧就簡譬如用簡單嚟講一個億咧，其實呢個涉及咧都可能去到幾十萬或者係一百萬大概嘅成本，噉啊涉及好好睇喺初期嗰陣時嘅市場嗰個未成熟，咁更加要做多啲功夫啦。頭先講到係可。

356
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:20,870
以誒投資者有有限啦，咁所以喺呢方面嘅marketing啊，同埋攞到誒評級啊，同埋要作出其他嘅配合咧。咁當然合規方面都係另外相相應，都係要加強同埋要要去符合嘅。咁所以成本咧都會係增加嘅。好唔該啊，黃總座。噉我諗咧，頭先其實啊陳建波議員同啊

357
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:40,880
梁繼昌議員兩位議員問過嘅一啲嘢咧，噉我唔知道誒政府當局會唔會統一都回應嚇？不包括誒住址實體嘅問題啦，時間性問題啦，會唔會影響嘅銀行面？頭先誒有團體代表都講啊，九啊九個percent喎，噉就誒呢個發行嘅成本啦。頭先啊梁議員問到。

358
01:20:40,880 --> 01:21:00,890
到點解唔將嗰個COP裏邊嘅一啲具體嘅要求擺落去我哋嘅schedule啦、彈性啦等等問題，我唔唔知誒政府當局可唔可以回應一下咧？唔該誒，我想回應下誒，即係誒梁繼昌議員誒，多謝梁梁議員嘅意見誒，佢誒提到係咪應該將嗰個？

359
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:20,900
個實務守則擺喺法例下邊，噉我相信呢個有少少難度，因為其實誒呢個處置機制，我頭先亦都提過一個重要嘅特色咧，就係真係要誒因應個別機構個別情況去處理。咁所以如果係將誒，

360
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:40,910
呢啲守則都寫埋喺法例度咧，我恐防嗰個即係呢一個彈性就會彈性。主席啊，我想澄清咧，我就係想要個門檻嗰個數字啫，其他你可以擺喺其他度。我需要個門檻，如果你要轉門檻咧，就要經過小組委員會，即係以後即係噉樣樣嚇嚇。我相信個門檻咧，誒頭先誒兩位金管局嘅代表亦都有澄清。

361
01:21:40,910 --> 01:22:00,920
亦都第一呢個諮詢期未完嘅，即係個門檻而家唔係一個定案。第二就係嗰個門檻，而亦都只係一個開始嘅，即係等佢哋去因應個別銀行嘅情況去做檢視嘅一個起點。嗰個門檻唔係最後決定佢係咪需要。

362
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:57,360
not based on individual firm circumstances, so we want to be that's a key priority for the MA is to be able to not take one one approach on resolution planning for all firms regardless of their starting point. Instead, the flexibility to set different resolution strategies.

363
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:17,370
For example, consider partial transfer or transfer strategies which provide a 50% reduction in the resolution component requirement for small banks. That's a really good example of how we can use our judgement to take account of firm circumstances. If there's a risk that if everything was hardwired into the rules, it would be more difficult to do.

364
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,260
誒，要做七。

365
01:26:47,990 --> 01:27:00,500
and if necessary phased appropriately should costs and market conditions deteriorate. 好嘅，我我諗都要畀其他委員先問一問先啦。張華峯議員唔該。

366
01:25:53,320 --> 01:26:07,690
When developing resolution plans and resolution strategies, to engage with individual firms on a bilateral basis in detail, and then also around the setting of an implementation timeline. So the rules provide for.

367
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:33,030
what we did to come up with that four percent number was take the weighted average of the responses we got from locally incorporated licensed banks and actually round it up a bit to ensure that we were being appropriately conservative.

368
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:57,950
三點三或者三三點至八個percent嘅gap位嘅，咁如果要從呢個計算咧，咁每間銀行咧可能要增加咗法制啊七億五千萬至到誒七誒七億五千至二二十億元嘅呢個呢個。

369
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:58,790
七年咧，股災嗰個政見大發，佢哋政府都lobby我哋係冇問題嘅，對呢世經濟完全冇問題嘅。但係而家發覺咧，以前我哋個少經幾嘅佔嘅市場比率咧三廿個percent，而家降到七個percent，所以我覺得好多好多咧，即係魔鬼都藏喺。

370
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:37,380
And the cost could be disproportionately felt by banks with different types of business models. So that's one of our key objectives, and the balance we're trying to strike is to provide some clarity in the code of practice, to provide some guidance, but so that it facilitates the application of judgment, so that we can tailor.

371
01:23:40,540 --> 01:24:00,550
key point of that is on a case by case basis we can consider implementation timelines. If individual firms face evidencable challenges in meeting the requirements, that it's open to the MA under the rules to take that into account. The rules provide powers to the MA to vary certain requirements to take into account.

372
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:24,460
所以24個月問題，那係一個硬要求喺分類上，但係分類嘅日期係根據EMA嘅判決，以及基於個案個案嘅做法。所以呢個係反映咗框架，即係條例提供嘅。而家冇任何條例規定最低150億歐元嘅資產閤格線。

373
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:47,170
What we're trying to provide in the code of practice draft code of practice currently under consultation is facilitate industry feedback on the MA's current judgement of where the line should be. We are open to industry feedback on that point. Maybe I'll ask my colleague Mr. Probert to talk about the debt issuance and and our thinking.

374
01:24:51,620 --> 01:25:11,630
Sure, thank you. So on the cost, as identified, we modelled on the basis of a four percent number. Just to clarify, this number was based on a quantitative information survey returns that we received from industry, which of course at the time necessarily reflected.

375
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:53,320
Of course, going forward, no one expects that that will necessarily be the cost of lack debt instruments indefinitely, and this is exactly where the type of flexibility that my colleague has just been talking about will come in. So useful. So both around the ability of the resolution authority.

376
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:27,980
24 months after classification, but also my colleague has already explained that leaving to one side for the moment non-Chinese Gsibs, no Dsibs, no Dsibs will have to meet lack requirements any earlier than 1 Jan 2022, no non-Dsibs will have to meet any lack requirements earlier than 1 July 20.

377
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:47,990
And for firms below three hundred billion, we'd consider further extending it. And just to re-emphasise, these are the earliest possible dates. So, in terms of classifying firms and requiring lack requirements to be met, this because of the flexibility provided by the rules, this can be done on a case-by-case basis.

378
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,050
就。

379
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:58,840
I guess.

380
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,000
sure.

381
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:46,740
就係唔需要強調即係咩黨派，因為實際上咧，今日好幾位發言嘅誒，我哋嘅議員咧，其實嘅睇法都有好多地方係都幾一致嘅。

382
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:53,720
個誒呢個呢個一千五百億係冇一個誒改變嘅話咧，誒我唔排除咧否決咗呢個草案啦。唔該，主席。好，唔該曬張議員。咁誒政府想唔想先回應下先咧？阿張秘書長或者係阿Mr. Wright。

383
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:55,170
resolution planning on individuals firms to set resolution strategies and there isn't anything in the primary that says what that strategy should be or what the requirements should be because it's designed to be able to take account of firm specific circumstances.

384
01:33:48,580 --> 01:34:07,220
在座嘅咧就都係真係業界嘅朋友，每一次咧有工商專業嘅朋友嚟到聽證會啦，佢哋表現咧都真係即係理性客觀好多啊，亦都務實噉樣反映個意見。有時即使個熱議係非常之強烈啦，就似乎都表達得太過温和啦。

385
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:20,790
啊！多謝主席。嗱，政府制定金融機構恥恥恥機制咧，目的係避免一些大到不能倒嘅銀行一陣出事咧，咁咧就對整個個金融系統帶嚟衝擊嘅。咁咧即係針對一啲大到不能倒嘅金融機構，當時咧二零一五年我都係。

386
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:40,800
嚟參加呢個呢個panel嘅，當時我哋大部分嘅討論都係點樣處置？如果發生呢個問題，個程序點樣處置嘅嘅嘅制度係點嘅？咁但係咧，今日咧佢哋誒攞翻嚟，我哋嗰個panel咧就係講到咧嗰個咧嘅安排就係一千五百億個資產線上。

387
01:27:40,800 --> 01:28:00,810
邊嘅噉啊？所有嘅銀行都受到規管嘅。咁從呢個數字嚟睇咧，即係咧誒，每間銀行就算市即係市場佔有率得零點六個percent，或者整體銀行總資產嘅一個percent嘅銀行，都納入呢個條例監管之下。噉我覺得咧，投

388
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:20,820
頭先好多好多嘅議員都誒有表達過，對呢個銀行嘅嗰個誒嗰個個規限咧就太嚴，對於嗰個銀行嘅資金運作而產生好大嘅問題。但係我喺呢度想表達咧，即係規模比較細嘅銀行並不是等於風險大嘅。即係而家咧就我睇到咧普遍嘅。

389
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:40,830
嘅銀行咧都誒有嗰個誒十八個percent資產充足比例嘅規定㗎。咁如果我哋呢啲銀行要實行新嘅呢個let嘅要求咧，咁咧就似乎要提到二十一至二十六個percent誒嗰個嗰個比例。咁中間咧有有。

390
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:20,550
七億五千萬到二十億元嘅呢個發行嗰個嗰個債券，咁對於呢個銀行係有好大嘅影響。誒頭先我都聽到啊，香港H M咧嗰個陳小姐講呢個只係一個框架嘅啫，但係呢個框架咧，我覺得咧，如果定咗落嚟咧，誒再去討。

391
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:40,560
討論細節嘅，根據每間銀行嘅呢個情況去定細節，我咧就好難即係改變㗎啦。呢個呢個呢個框架咧，如果定咗落嚟，以後咧你想有啲要求咧，都好難改變啊！呢個呢個政府嘅呢個呢個態度㗎啦，即係突然間畀個冷尾，百。

392
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:19,080
即係嗰個良好嘅炎黃之中嘅啊，咁嗰個我我就係希望咧，即係誒呢個誒香港S M咧，即係聽咗我哋大家嘅意見，即係好好嘅考慮咧，對整個市場嘅發展嘅。咁因為頭先亦都好多啊，即係語言都講曬講曬所有嘅理理。

393
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:39,090
幾句嘅啦，噉我亦都覺得咧呢個誒銀行嘅呢個表達係非常之誒誒正確，而且咧對整體香港嘅呢個金融業咧係有長遠嘅嗰個發展嘅貢獻，所以我亦都好似阿陶鰲新議員一樣咧，如果呢個。

394
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:19,130
Reminding all members today that we are looking at the rules rather than the draft code of practice in which the one hundred and fifty billion threshold is set out for industry consultation, and the rules themselves cover all AIs like the FiRo itself. And in terms of sort of the point about lack rules providing a framework, again.

395
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:39,140
This is consistent with the primary legis the intention in the primary legislation to not specify set requirements because it's very important that the resolution planning process is done on a case by case basis. So under the primary legislation, the individual resolution authorities are provided powers to engage in.

396
01:31:55,750 --> 01:32:15,760
Exactly the same way, the lack rules are designed to take account of firm specific circumstances. So I think we're very much consistent in terms of the proposed approach to lack rules. What we're trying to do in the draft code of practice is provide a little extra clarity about how that judgement would be applied by the AME, and we look forward to.

397
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:35,770
今天，我認為我們已設定出思考，這已影響MA的判斷，關於為什麼150億的門檻是適當的。但我們非常活躍於我們今天聽到的回饋，我們會肯定地把它納入考慮，作為諮詢過程的一部分，以及我們在12月3日前收到的書面回應。

398
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:56,270
啊！但係我想誒講翻咧，我而家聽到，起碼有三到四位委員就話咧，即係如果你嗰個誒COP實務守則嗰樣嘢唔有一啲明確性嘅嘢，同呢個rules有啲誒掛鈎咧，佢哋唔排除會否決呢個rules。噉我想先將呢樣嘢同大家再講講，即係。

399
01:32:56,270 --> 01:33:16,280
即係明確下先，噉我不如我哋誒等下一位阿盧偉國議員都問咗先，好冇？阿盧議員唔該。誒多謝主席。誒阿陶根生員就誒不在席啦。不過佢頭先誒發言嘅時間咧，我就係我唔會因人發言，所以我同意佢有啲觀點㗎。但係咧，我亦都認為。

400
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:36,290
佢咧嚇嚇就猛強調建制派非轉制派呢個冇必要嘅，即係我好希望咧就話對於重要嘅，對於香港嗰個金融業、銀行業發展重要嘅問題，對於咧實際上都牽涉到好多民生嘅問題啦。大家咧都係平心靜氣嚇，即係客觀去睇、客觀去分析嚇。

401
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,530
啲擔憂嘅。

402
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,450
誒。

403
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,570
在座嘅其實。

404
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:13,000
有陣時，香港咧即係做到加零一啊，即係不得止㗎啦。

405
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,920
今日講得好好啊！誒，我哋唔會一刀切嘅，我哋會咧每個個案去考慮嘅。

406
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:23,150
對於香港特別係中小企，對於好多客户咧，都係重要嘅夥伴。

407
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:14,950
要做，但係今日咧就與會者實際上提咗好即係實質嘅問題㗎，其中有一啲咧。

408
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:47,940
向行業啊，向好多咧係需要呢個銀行服務嘅中小企客户去交代嘅喎。

409
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:12,400
今次咧，主席啊，如果我哋就噉啊冒然通過呢個框架嘅法案嘅話咧，就等於開一張空頭支票，嗯。

410
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:42,440
咁誒，亦都由於咧另一方面嘅要求咧，使到本地嘅某啲大銀行嚇向來都係號稱自己為香港人嘅服務嘅銀行咧，都基本上趕住中小企。我哋喺以前堂上咧聽到唔少咧呢一方面嘅苦水，話連開户都困難。

411
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:27,510
啊！噉啊，有啲手法咧，我唔係鼓你用啊。不過好概嘆咧，你有陣時會見到咧，就喺聽證會之前咧，已經下邊示威區拉曬橫額㗎啦。啊，今日你哋冇做啦。噉啊，亦都有咧，係組織一啲個別人士咧，就安咗好多粗口嘅組織名啊。噉啊，令到咧～

412
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:47,520
就主席都好尷尬，唔知讀唔讀佢嘅組織名號，即係即係立法會聽證會咧，就周時都出現噉嘅狀況。所以咧，我覺得今日咧，其實就誒誒，雖然咧我誒遲咗入嚟會議室啦，因為有其他事務，實際上一路都聽住大家嘅發言，就其實有好多點咧係誒大家共同係非常。

413
01:34:48,810 --> 01:35:08,820
誒主席就我我覺得咧，就當然作為誒香港係一個國際金融中心咧，當然好多喺國際上嘅啲規矩啊，特別一啲合規嘅大家嘅即係協議咧，當然我哋都要去執行。但係咧，就我都聽到好多位朋友，包括我哋議員都講咧，即係。

414
01:35:42,720 --> 01:36:02,730
所以即係我唔係話有意講咗第啲話題，不過咧呢個正正係咧睇到業界面對嘅問題，佢哋成本增加咧，其實最終受累嘅就係香港嘅企業，特別中小企、香港嘅客户。咁所以我我我我覺得係。

415
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:39,210
咁先至得人驚啊！如果你唔清楚講畀我哋聽，你考慮有邊幾個誒誒因素？啲因素咧，你點樣定嚇？誒，譬如話個門檻嚇等等。噉我哋即係開張空投資票咧，就好似就即係好難向。

416
01:36:48,340 --> 01:37:08,350
誒，所以我唔知道即係點樣誒處理最好，但係呢個點樣處理咧，我諗等在席嘅誒誒政府代表啊，同埋監管局即係去去去考慮啦。即係你知道咧，我哋嘅困難原則上咧，我哋覺得咧係即係啲合規方面嘅誒嘅誒執行咧，我哋。

417
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:00,720
head of timing in Hong Kong.

418
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:28,070
The consultation threshold has been discussed at the highest levels within the HKMA.

419
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:20,970
佢就係某一啲嘅誒銀行集團喺香港嘅分公司。

420
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:32,200
I just respond quickly to a few of the points, and on the 150 billion threshold.

421
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:22,050
However, I want to reassure members and the banks that are here today that we will listen to the feedback that we've received, and certainly I can reassure them as well that.

422
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:52,170
嘅就係呢啲嘅誒誒誒G S I B咧，就佢哋嗰個實施嗰個時間咧，又可以寬鬆一啲嚇，亦都定咗一啲。

423
01:39:48,990 --> 01:40:01,270
process. So, I think that that's that. I want to make clear that we will we will take that take the feedback into account in considering what the appropriate final threshold should be, and we won't ignore the points that have been raised here today.

424
01:37:52,450 --> 01:38:05,800
延後一啲嘅實施時間嘅，咁即係呢啲，如果你唔係清清楚楚，即係向立法會交代嘅話，我我哋點點過嗰個所謂做一個框架嘅法案得㗎？誒，主席，即係呢個都係。

425
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:17,890
Now, I'd like to ask my colleague very briefly to touch on the point about international comparison. Some comments have been made that Hong Kong is sort of front-running, and maybe I just provide a little bit of context as to, you know, the global effort that is currently ongoing to set lack requirements for large and small banks.

426
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:25,320
主席嘅問題，主席主持呢個都會有難度。我我想聽下睇下在職官員緊點答，或者咧特別係咧，我哋今日有銀行嘅代表啦，有多啲苦水唔該你再講啊。我主席咧會寬鬆畀有時間講啊。係啊，誒噉啊，好，Mr. Wright，你想先回應下先，好唔該。

427
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:41,260
噉佢哋嘅母公司咧，其實所在會係不同嘅經濟體。咁不同嘅經濟體喺國際上咧，其實就呢一方面L.V.C嘅嘅執嘅嘅執行咧，其實都有一啲嘅諗法，有一啲嘅即係協議啊。譬如喺呢個新興市場經濟體裏邊咧。

428
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:52,490
We've talked today about what's informed the setting of that threshold for consultation, and I hope the sharing of our views has at least explained the factors that we are trying to consider from the perspective of the MA. And in particular, we're trying to balance private interests and recognise the costs, and we have.

429
01:38:52,490 --> 01:39:12,500
spent a lot of time analysing how the lack requirements would impact individual institutions, but we're trying to balance those costs against the interests of depositors and the wider financial stability interests here for the Hong Kong economy overall. So this the current threshold is an expression of our current thinking.

430
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:48,990
But equally, this feedback will be discussed again at the highest level within the HKMA in considering the threshold as part of the consultation process. And I can reassure members and the banks here that we will take their feedback seriously in considering what is the appropriate final threshold after the consultation.

431
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:38,260
Okay, Robert. So in relation to that, actually, I would like to draw attention to the response that was submitted to the question coming out of the previous subcommittee meeting, asking for a comparison of progress on the timeline implementation of LAC requirements in Hong Kong compared to other major international financial markets.

432
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:58,270
Markets, and we were asked to comment on the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and the mainland. Just to very quickly go through those one at a time. So in the the US, final TLAC requirements will come into force from 1st January 2019, so considerably ahead.

433
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,590
does not require.

434
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,400
代表仲想補充，OK？啊，中銀香港啊，啊，啊，嚴副總係。

435
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:43,980
In China, as has been pointed out, the imposition of TILAC requirements remains pending, and the FSB TILAC term sheet.

436
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:16,020
50% at the end of 2017, implying that that deadline of 2025 on that mechanism is very likely to come forward.

437
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:27,070
And in Japan, the TLAC requirements are being phased in from 31st of March 2019. We were also asked.

438
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:39,620
This year, and that is sort of four plus years ahead of the time in which we're now talking about lack requirements actually needing to be met by

439
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:33,360
In Singapore, they do not have they have not yet imposed TILAC requirements, but eligibility criteria for bail-in instruments was set out in regulations that have just been published in October this year.

440
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:58,310
AI's in Hong Kong, and I think it might be that it's the it's the early engagement and the fact that we are aiming to give industry a long lead-in time that perhaps has created the perception that we're front-running other jurisdictions. But I hope, as the evidence I've just set out demonstrates, we don't think that that is the case.

441
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:19,500
In the UK, UK GSBs will be required to meet minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements from 1 Jan 2019, with smaller firms being required to start meeting requirements from 1 Jan 2020. Again, ahead of anything we are proposing here.

442
01:41:45,870 --> 01:42:05,880
Chinese GSEs to meet TLAC requirements until 1 Jan 2025, but it's important to note there is a caveat to that, in that that timeline will be brought forward if the corporate debt to GDP ratio in China exceeds 55% before the end of 2020, and this ratio was close to.

443
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:47,600
to consider this was including these jurisdictions, so you'll have seen in the administration's response, it was also said out that in Switzerland, obviously another major financial centre, final loss absorbency requirements were published in October 2015, being phased in up until the end of 2019. So I think on the

444
01:42:47,600 --> 01:43:07,610
basis of those comparisons, what we see is that actually Hong Kong is not front running other jurisdictions, and if anything, certainly in reference to some of those, we're coming a little bit behind. I think the perception might have arisen that we are front running because what we've been trying to do is to.

445
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:27,620
engage at a very early stage in the process, in order to exactly allow for appropriate consultation, and then allow industry a lengthy lead-in and preparation time. So the the first public engagement on this policy was the publication of the consultation paper in January.

446
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:19,640
O.K.啊嗱，我想先問咗啲委員先，因為誒，如果你哋仲有問題問我哋嘅銀行團體代表咧，噉我就誒，即係如果你哋冇其他問題咧，我就先請啲團體代表就離開咗，我哋再同政府當局開會。咁誒，我睇下你哋有冇嘢仲想問啊？有銀行。

447
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:44,690
誒，因為咧誒，其實誒，中文香港咧就係一間DC，而佢嘅舞行就係China，咁喺個跨境，所以當才頭先我都講咧，喺個跨境cross border嗰個cooperation同埋個discussion係好重要嘅。噉我哋其實係由今年，其實都唔係今年啦，由舊年開始，即係都認識。

448
01:44:44,690 --> 01:45:04,700
知道有一個噉嘅情況咧，其實都一直有同我哋嘅母行啦，係儘量去溝通。咁其實喺C B I C，因為誒大家可能都知就係今年嘅年中，佢哋做咗一個重重整啦，噉啊改咗係一個銀保監會。咁其實喺個過程裏邊咧，我哋都儘量去了解，其實究竟喺個resolution大家嗰個溝通喺。

449
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,470
係。

450
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,550
個咩藥咩情況咧？咁噉我哋。

451
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:44,420
包括個合規成本增加，而一個中型銀行都有幾百人啊，做緊compens。

452
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:54,870
嗰邊嗰個情況，咁而誒武行嗰邊喺China咧，其實又冇一個已經清晰。

453
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:58,780
嚇！但係就唔需要係而家二零二二年一月，或者我甚至要plan係更早就要去做Tlet嗰啲嘅issuance。

454
01:46:55,180 --> 01:47:08,870
個好嘅一個互相兩個resolution entity咧，有個好嘅discussion。咁誒，我哋都同金管局講過好多次，即係希望喺呢個呢個噉嘅溝通裏邊咧，做得比較到位，同埋。

455
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:16,550
噉我呢個係我哋覺得喺誒我哋嘅誒意見咯，咁所以都希望金管局同埋誒各議員可以喺個考慮上面，其實都有嗰個誒誒執行嗰個問題咯嚇。好啊，唔該誒，想問下銀行代表仲有冇補充？

456
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:28,030
覺得喺個過程裏邊咧，其實真係係一個好primary stage嘅，即係即係好好初步、好初步嘅情況。咁頭先有議員都問佢話：誒噉我買T咧誒係咪唔得咧？銀行之間係咪唔可以買互買咧？咁誒，in principle你可以買嘅，不過你會減你個capital嚇，因為其實佢就會用你個capital base去減你跌得嘅capital。

457
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:48,040
咁所以呢一啲一大堆嘅問題咧，其實喺我哋同誒武行嗰個所謂resolution咧，當我要去做呢樣嘢嘅時候，因為佢都要二零二五年先至已開始。但係因為喺我哋嗰個resolution嗰個strategy裏邊咧，其實我哋係需要同武行有個好好好close嘅接軌嘅。咁喺嗰個位裏邊咧，其實我哋會影響武行。

458
01:45:55,150 --> 01:46:15,160
誒，即係佢嘅時間表就係睇住二零二五。咁究竟係會好似頭先啊，Mr. Wei講話會提早二零二三啊，定二零二四？其實又係一個question mark嚟嘅，即係淨係得個講，唔知幾時。咁所以其實喺成個過程咧，都喺啲uncertainty嘅底下咧，去叫銀行去plan啊head。

459
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:35,170
你個叻點樣去comply咧？咁噉，所以誒呢一度咧，其實我哋由今年一月都有同金管局一直去discuss，因為誒明白佢對dissip有一個即係佢覺得係一個影響系統性整個financial industry啦。咁所以我哋都理解嘅，我哋都明白嘅。咁但係喺個過程裏邊就一直都覺得應該要有個cross border。

460
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:55,180
一個好嘅溝通。如果冇嗰個跨境嘅溝通咧，其實喺個實踐上邊咧，誒，我哋都覺得會帶嚟一個幾混亂同埋幾困難嘅情況啊。咁呢個喺COP裏邊咧，已經佢唔再即係唔再係touch呢樣嘢啦，因為佢已經預咗個discipline行啦。咁所以我哋喺一直嘅過程嘅傾咧，都係覺得應該要有個。

461
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:29,160
如果真係要提早嘅，誒，譬如好似佢哋所講，誒，因為我明白佢哋個ratio係講緊GDP ratio啦，同埋嗰個誒外債嗰個ratio啦。噉佢話中國而家已經去到一個比較接近，就係FSB誒所謂嗰個trigger要佢哋行T rate提早行T rate嘅情況。咁但係其實都仲係有個距離，究竟？

462
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:49,280
誒而家China嗰個情況係咪可以仍然每年咁grow得咁快噉啊？情況底下去做到嗰reach嗰個ratio咧，其實都係一個question mark。噉我哋覺得，如果真係誒冇行係可以under China嘅jurisdiction，提早喺二零二三或者二零二四佢要行嘅噉，其實中銀香港一定會跟。

463
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:40,040
哦，好啊，好啊，阿陳議員，你第二round嘅問題啦。啊，唔該曬。嗱，我諗誒，今個喺呢二三十年咧，其實管理係做得好好嘅。啊，上次金融風暴之後咧，我哋都冇乜銀行出事咧，都大幅增加咗資本要求啦、風險管理嘅要求啦，都好好嚴格嘅。噉啊，近年啲銀行嗰啲經營成本啊大幅增加，咁好多因素啊。

464
01:48:44,700 --> 01:49:04,710
噉啊！另外啲充資本充足比率啊、流動現金比率都大幅提升咗。咁呢啲咧雖然係會增加銀行成本，但係真係有助於銀行去穩健啊嘛，唔會出事啊嘛。但係你相反呢個叻嘅要求咧，如果根本都做得唔好咧，不但不會令銀行更加穩健啊，反而會咧削弱咗銀行嗰個盈利基礎，令佢哋更加容。

465
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:27,200
係啦。

466
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,850
你都去表達下啦。

467
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:35,170
誒，各位銀行代表，有冇啲阿陳議員講佢佢仲未為你哋講出你哋心聲嘅嘢，你哋可以再補充嘅。

468
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:48,150
啊，黃副行政總裁係，請講。誒，各位議員就誒，我想回應翻頭先金管局誒，Mr. White啊誒所講或者誒同誒。

469
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:24,720
出事，即係所以你希望你明白呢一個leak同嗰個compens同埋你資增加佢啲資本嘅嗰個作用係完全唔同嘅嚇。噉啊呢個如果噉樣做得唔好咧，根本有一個典型嘅本末倒置咧，好心做壞事啊。所以我建議咧，就政府點做？第一，你放過啲中小銀行啦嚇，只限G涉或者D涉嗰個嗰。

470
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:44,730
兩類，你認為個噉你咪做咯？點解要搞佢哋咧？咁起碼好處就係咧，就唔會咁多銀行一齊向市場即係發呢啲噉嘅誒letpaper啦。咁令到有需要嘅銀行多多啲空間啊嘛。你你而家佢哋又出出嚟爭埋一份，咁個市場咪爭到即係非常之貴啦。第二咧，對其他指定為處置實體嘅咧，亦都要。

471
01:49:44,730 --> 01:50:04,740
係即係佢要考慮對佢嘅成本嘅影響咯。即係如果明，哇！我正如我講，佢盈盈利影響十幾percent，噉你每年咁搞係咪適當咧？係咪風險成嗰個嗰個風險同嗰個成本係咪成比例咧？呢個要要要諗啦，儘量減到最低啦。第三就推行嘅時間啊，要配合本地銀行嘅需要啦啊！即係你你基本。

472
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:24,750
上符合國際需要咪得咯？你點解要行到最？即係我知道政府成日都否認話佢行到最快嗰個嘅，但係你都係合格咪得咯？你唔使攞優㗎，我諗係咪？即係總之你要對新加坡或者對我哋相附近嘅國家都係保持競爭力啊嘛。咁所以我想最後問咧，即係各位有冇各位銀行界有冇咩？我呢度冇講，或者各位議員都冇講，你哋都係羣相希望。

473
01:50:48,570 --> 01:51:08,580
Robert都講過下啦，即係話嗰啲誒同國際方面嘅相比較啦嚇，咁都提出咗誒有相關領先嘅國家啊，甚至有啲亞洲國家啦，包括中國嗰啲比較時間表啦。咁噉，我想喺度想提出或者係澄清一點咧，就。

474
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:28,590
係基本上呢啲國家，譬如講美國啊、英國啊，或或者美國啊、誒誒歐洲啲國家啊、誒日本啊，即係比較領先嘅國家咧。其實佢哋講緊嗰個叻嘅誒相關嘅誒法規啊、相關嘅規則咧，係針對佢哋嘅G C。

475
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:48,600
啊，或者係誒D社啦嚇，咁譬如日本咁講，其實佢係講緊係三大最大嘅銀行，再加一最大嗰個誒金融誒證券公司，噉啊四間就係頭先講緊係話啊，二零一九開始要飛先噉樣嘅嚇，咁其他日本嘅中型小型。

476
01:51:48,600 --> 01:52:08,610
嘅金融機構係不納入佢哋嘅T零嘅要求啊。咁美國都係啦，又講緊嗰八大嘅最大嘅誒銀行佢哋嘅支持。OK，咁美國其實咧就已經喺十月咧就已經進一步話誒去誒執行佢哋喺五月。

477
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:28,620
國會所頒布嘅法例咧，係對銀行嘅監管咧進一步放鬆嘅。啊，包括係七千億美金總資產以下嗰啲銀行受監管嘅要求咧，係作出係適當嘅放鬆嘅。咁而家佢哋都冇話特別呢啲係誒最大嘅百間銀行之下嘅leg。

478
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:48,630
Requirement係點樣去推動？咁所以講緊嘅嘢咧，我哋係要作出一個噉嘅澄清啦。咁頭先講到新加坡就話冇呢個叻 requirement 啊，啊啊，即係噉樣。噉我咁其實我想講其他亞洲國家其實都冇呢個叻 requirement 嘅。啊，特別係係去到話啲係誒佢哋non-deep嗰啲嘅銀行咧。

479
01:52:48,630 --> 01:53:08,640
啊！多謝大家。好，嗯，其他我哋嘅委員誒有冇想？仲有一位，仲有啊，東亞銀行啊啊，唐富行正總裁。多謝主席。噉我諗誒想補充一下咧，噉我哋一路講緊咧就誒叻嘅paper咧，其實係大連銀行一個額外嘅。

480
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:28,650
誒資金成本咁呢個所謂額外，其實係因為相對於咧誒存款或者銀行，如果出先呢一date咧，咁呢個出let咧一定係貴過依兩樣嘢嘅。咁呢個第一點啊，咁第二咧就係誒，由如果好多銀行喺同一時一個好短嘅時間咧，都需要喺市場咧出let paper咧，咁呢個因為供求嘅關係，亦都。

481
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:28,590
好，誒，仲有冇其他銀行代表想？

482
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:33,010
都補充意見。咁委員嗰邊咧，我想請問委員有冇？

483
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:07,800
咁喺過程裏邊，究竟政府嗰個諮詢工作點做㗎？

484
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:56,620
個起點，亦都唔係自動代表咧。如果你過咗一百五十誒一千五百億嗰個門檻咧，就自動。

485
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:42,730
想啊啊，盧偉各位誒，多謝主席。我我真係好好真係好想問翻咧，就政府代表同埋金管局代表咧。

486
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:24,200
到咧銀行喺出叻批賠嘅時候咧，可以唔需要喺咁短時間要出曬，咁可以攤分分開幾年嘅時間嚟到出嘅話咧，咁令到嗰個誒即係利息嗰個誒誒喺喺利息嘅方面就可以咧就誒正常翻少少。

487
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:48,660
都會咧就誒令到咧嗰個融資成本上升嘅嚇，咁呢個就係誒誒由於個時即係個時間嘅問題緊迫嘅問題帶嚟嘅一個結果。咁所以我我希望金管嗰邊可以考慮咧，就正話有我哋啲同業提出啦，誒會唔會唔同銀行有唔同嘅時間表，即係或者甚至唔同嘅。

488
01:53:48,660 --> 01:54:08,670
起步，咁另外一方面咧，就算一間銀行嚟講，會唔會誒採取一個好似類似Basel III capital buffers嗰個方法嚇？譬如我哋二零二二年開始係起步，噉就完全達標可能係誒over譬如兩三或者四年噉樣嚇，咁先至去到叫誒完全達標，咁依個亦都令到。

489
01:54:43,030 --> 01:55:03,040
嗱，今日咧就其實與會者，我頭先都話啦，即係佢哋即係講得好斯文㗎啦。但係咧就完全理解到咧佢哋嘅擔憂同埋面對嘅困難，同埋咧即係可能最終咧呢成本轉嫁到係誒企業轉嫁到客户嚇，特別係中小企個個影響。

490
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:28,190
呢啲問題唔係應該今日喺度，即係大家你眼望我眼嘅喎，係咪應該一早已經即係傾好曬，使到業界咧冇擔心噉，然後將嗰個啊即係而家要要要過嘅呢一個規則咧攞嚟我哋立法會咧噉啊，好簡單嘅問題，睇下邊位可以回答個啊？

491
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:48,200
張秘書長，係多謝盧議員嘅誒意見同埋問題。誒，其實誒，正如主席一開始已經誒澄清過咧，誒，我哋而家審視緊呢一個係一個規則。噉就住呢個規則，其實我哋係做過兩輪嘅諮詢。第一輪就係今年嘅年頭，係公眾諮詢。咁然之。

492
01:55:48,200 --> 01:56:08,210
之後，當我哋有一個誒，即係誒草擬嘅法例嘅初稿嘅時候咧，金管局亦都即係誒對住就住業界誒進行咗第二次諮詢。咁但係我觀乎頭先，其實主要大家針對嗰個問題係講緊嗰個門檻。咁誒，即係誒，我哋喺今次個會度亦都。

493
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:28,220
好多次解釋，呢個門檻其實係擺喺個實務守則嗰度。實務守則裏邊嗰個所謂一百五十誒一千五百億嗰個誒要求咧，其實仲係一個草擬嘅階段。而家正正就係做緊諮詢，誒呢個諮詢期係去到十二月三號。咁正如頭先金管局嘅同事亦都。

494
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:48,230
再三表示誒，今日或者係喺諮詢期收到嘅意見，佢哋會重視，亦都會誒，即係仔細考慮，先至最後定定嗰個一誒一千五百億嗰個門檻。而一千五百億嗰個門檻咧，亦都係佢哋為個別銀行做誒，即係策略分析嗰個。

495
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:16,910
被要求實施呢個誒large requirements，或者一定係去到即係雙倍你嗰個基本嘅一個資資本要求。咁呢個我想即係再三強調誒。另外咧就係誒大家都誒，即係雖然我哋諮詢期係未完啦。啊，金管局嗰個就住誒實務守則嗰。

496
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:36,920
個諮詢期係去到十二月三號，咁但係今日我哋都喺即係，因為誒金管局其實過去一段時間亦都同銀行業界係做咗好多個誒，即係會議啊、會面啊、聆聽佢哋嘅聲音。所以今日喺個會議度咧，金管局亦都分分享咗一啲初步嘅睇法。咁呢啲初步嘅睇法當然亦都幫到業。

497
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:55,350
係啦。

498
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,160
五分鐘啦。

499
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:51,130
阿松先啦嚇嘛，唔該。

500
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:18,620
咁呢個問題就即係佢哋應該預計到嚟到，我哋會遇到咩困難㗎啦？係咪啊？

501
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:32,020
即係噉，如果咁講，係咪應該個到到到呢個年底，諮詢佢過曬啊，真係講掂曬嗰啲細節咧，然後先至即係我哋通過呢個而家呢個框架咧？咁誒，係咪應該噉樣處理更好咧？

502
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:50,890
界同埋議員理解，我哋而家做緊嘅嘅嘅，即係一啲一啲思路啦。噉我哋係好樂意喺呢個會之後咧，好快即係用誒書面嘅形式提供畀誒呢個小組委員會等大家作為參考。

503
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:29,010
今日誒，大家提出嚟嘅問題，你哋會點樣解決？然後我哋先至可以，佢哋又滿意到呢個答案啦。噉我先至進入去逐條審議啦。咁誒，我睇下嗰位委員覺得噉樣處理方法O唔O K？同意。同意啊，阿。

504
01:57:51,950 --> 01:58:11,960
啊！主席，即係我我我就覺得即係呢個答案就我真係唔好滿意嘅。即係我相信政府都會諗到你個框架叫我哋通過。正如我講咧，就開一張空頭支票噉啊。日後喺執行上，我哋就即係冇權再過問啦。咁即係噉，我我哋好難做㗎嘛。

505
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:52,470
嗱，其實咧，誒，政府當我想，我聽到今日有差唔多係全部嘅在席嘅委員咧，都對而家呢個框架同埋實務守則之間存在一個即係誒冇冇能夠連接起嚟咧，係有一個擔憂嘅。噉我覺得咧，頭先啊，陶錦新。

506
01:58:52,470 --> 01:59:12,480
議員都講啦，或者啊啊梁繼昌議員都講，就希望你哋即係回覆咁誒，要講翻咧，就係話你哋諗住點樣樣將兩樣嘢咧，我諗連接起嚟，噉我哋令到我哋而家在座嗰啲委員咧，先有信心咧去通過誒呢條噉嘅條例嘅。咁所以本來咧，今日應該係。

507
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:32,490
聽完公眾嘅意見之後咧，我哋就開始進行逐條審議。但係而家因為收到大家咁多唔同意見咧，我係冇可能進入去逐條審議嘅。噉我希望咧，當局咧就係誒，頭先啊張秘書長都講啦，用書面咧回應咗今日所有議員提出嘅問題，包括陶錦生議員嘅問題啦，梁繼昌議員提出話可。

508
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:52,500
可唔可以用schedule去去將某一啲誒即係數目咧擺咗入去呢一條主體嘅嘅規則裏邊等等嘅嘢，你哋嘅諗法係點樣樣？噉我哋先至可以咧去到即係審議嘅。如果唔係，我諗大家睇唔到你哋嘅一個回應咧，佢哋係唔可能畀我進入去逐條審議嘅。

509
01:59:52,500 --> 02:00:12,510
咁呢個第一點，所以今日我係唔會進行逐條審議嘅。但係咧，誒，我想講就係其實法律顧問啦，我哋嘅法律顧問啦，或者上次我哋呢個委員咧、委員會咧、小組委員會都有一啲問題咧，我就想yen咧，就借呢個機會咧，就等你哋可以講曬先。咁變咗下一次咧，就主要集中咧，就係。

510
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:49,540
有冇其他委員表達唔同意見咧？冇咧，噉我就團體嗰邊。如果大家冇問題咧，我就多謝曬各位團體今日抽時間上嚟。噉就誒，大家可以先離席。咁等我哋同政府嗰邊咧，就頭先我講啲問題咧，就誒一日去先處理，好唔好啊？唔該曬各位。咁不如我哋休會五分鐘先啦，等大家都鬆。
