00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,280

00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:26,350
委員會，尤其表達深切嘔心，和驚訝，關於貧。

24
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,300
It's said that the secretary of the transport and housing is not here, for he was the supervising.

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:44,500
委員會已決定舉行進一步聽證會，並延遲一份有關此議題的完整報告。

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:20,850
covers our conclusions and recommendations on the chapter on procurement and maintenance of government vessels only.

27
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:36,550
Effectiveness, in particular, for the Discipline Services Department to carry out law enforcement and emergency duties.

28
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:36,420
In view of the number and complexity of issues raised in the chapter on administration of lump sum grants by the social welfare department, supervised by the social welfare bureau.

29
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:42,920
judgement of marine department and the inexplicable decision in suspending the processing of vessels procurement projects for 35 months from December 2009 to October 2012.

30
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:53,750
The committee expresses alarm and finds it unacceptable that the marine department had failed to fulfil its duty in providing effective and timely government vessel procurement service for the user departments.

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,210
This。

32
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,950
在2014。

33
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,050
Marking scheme for the tender assessment.

34
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,690
The case only came to light, Mr. President.

35
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,570
委員會也表達深切 concern。

36
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,760
In this connection, the committee finds it appalling.

37
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,700
不acceptable about the deficiency in the marine department maintenance term contract management mechanism.

38
00:04:51,210 --> 00:05:00,930
委員會指出，此決定在中止船隻採購項目，導致採購新船隻嚴重延宕。

39
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:12,070
The average ages of the four major classes of government vessels have increased significantly in the past 10 years as a result of such delay.

40
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:26,940
MD's performance in implementing new vessels recruitment projects, and step up its supervisory role to proactively identify problems faced by the marine department.

41
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:14,460
This was reviewed by a case of long outstanding payment of 1.68 million dollars for 98 works item carried out between 2010 to 2014.

42
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:13,250
Performance monitoring role effectively in the present case of the Marine Department implementation of vessels procurement projects. It's sad that he is not here. He should have learned more. The Transport and Housing Bureau is urged to closely monitor.

43
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:32,110
The delay for this 1.68 million was caused by the subject inspector who did not obtain approval for the job orders and did not submit relevant invoices to the Marine Department Accounting Services Section for processing.

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:32,500
In turn, call for more preventive maintenance and incur extra maintenance costs and downtime for the vessels. As a result, the user department's operation safety, efficiency and effectiveness have adversely been affected.

45
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:46,680
委員會已研究其他與提供維護服務有關的議題，包括海事部門的不足，包括報告船舶可用率的不足，以及從預購維護期合約中獲得的有限競爭。

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:26,570
The marine department is responsible for the procurement of new vessels as well as their maintenance for 14 government departments, including five discipline services departments. The vessels are essential for the department's operation, safety, efficiency.

47
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:14,740
Among the 25 ongoing vessel projects, 12 of them, Mr. President, have experienced delays, including five projects which have missed their target vessel delivery dates by five months to four years, and seven projects which were still in tender shipbuilding stage.

48
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:56,860
That the transport and housing bureau, Mr. Secretary in absentia, as the bureau overseeing the operation of the marine department, as in other cases previously investigated by the committees on department under its supervision, have failed again to perform.

49
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,020
當啲合約要續簽。

50
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,040
質詢底下質詢，林卓廷議員。

51
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,350
lastly, I like to record my appreciation.

52
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,870
委員會 notes that the marine department have taken various measures to enhance the management of TOEUM contracts.

53
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:04,290
Of the contribution made by members of this committee, our gratitude goes to the witnesses who attended the hearings. I would also like to express.

54
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:16,380
Our gratitude to the director of audit and his colleagues for their unfailing support, and last but not least to our secretary for their unfailing support too. Thank you.
