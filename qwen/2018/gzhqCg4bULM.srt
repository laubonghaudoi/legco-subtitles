This report contains our conclusions and recommendations on Chapter One, on management of restored landfills, and Chapter Eight on Charting Section of Route Eight.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:39,920
在香港，有13個廢棄垃圾填埋場，不是設計符合當代環境標準，需要進行復原工程，需要復原

15
00:01:53,230 --> 00:02:13,240
In view of the various site constraints of these landfills, such as ground settlement and continuous generation of landfill gas, which may cause environmental and safety problem to the surrounding areas, recreation use is the most suitable after use.

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:36,050
The committee expresses astonishment and grave concern and finds it unacceptable about the EPD's failure in its important role to monitor the contractor's compliances with statutory and contractual requirements in operating restoration facilities.

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,960

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:29,800
The committee expresses serious dismay and finds it unacceptable about the delay and lack of effective coordination in the development of after-use facilities in restored landfills.

26
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:53,920
EPD only came to know about the non-compliances after receiving complaints in two thousand and sixteen, some ten years after the contractor took up the aftercare work of this landfill.

27
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:20,730
section which links沙田和長沙灣was built in to alleviate the traffic congestion between鰂魚湧和沙田。The construction works of the project was implemented through awarding three work contracts.

28
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:56,720
delay in project there was project delays and cost overrun as a result of ineffective coordination between the LCSD, the Home Affairs Department, the architectural architectural services department and the EPD.

31
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:46,840
The committee recommends that the relevant departments should take appropriate actions, such as forming a working group among the departments and hiring an external consultant to assist in identifying viable development options for the closed landfills in view of the various physical constraints.

32
00:05:40,070 --> 00:06:00,080
As it is common for government works department to engage consultant in major public works, the committee strongly remind this department that unsatisfactory performance of consultant will have significant impact on the progress of the relevant works. This may cost.

33
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,340
consultants。

The use of the latest and advanced information technology should be explored in assisting the preparation and vetting processes.

37
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:11,480
for the present case, the Legislative Council only knew about this extra contractual settlements in the Director of Audit Report Number Seventy.

38
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:38,500
Three contracts, a similar or extra contractual settlement sum of 130 million dollars was agreed between the administration and consultant.

39
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:26,870
The committee strongly demand the administration to explore setting up a reporting mechanism to let go for similar cases. Lastly, I wish to record my appreciation of the contribution made by members of the committee.

40
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:56,670
discrepancy were found in the tender documents and in drawings prepared by the consultant. The committee strongly demands the works department to review the existing mechanism in vetting the tender document and consultant outputs.

41
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:43,890
Now, gratitude also goes to the witnesses who attended the hearings, helped by the committee. I would like to express our gratitude to the director of audit and his colleagues for their unfailing support. Last but not least, I like to thank the secretariat for their hard work. Thank you.

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:40,750
The committee expresses astonishment and grave concern and finds it unacceptable about the highway department failure to properly vet the outputs and monitor the performance of a consultant in the Chartine section project. Omissions or and

43
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:20,090
Long delays and subsequent and subsequent rectification works, which will incur additional costs substantially, the relevant works departments should bear an ultimate responsibility and role to monitor monitor these unsatisfactory performance of some of the.

44
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:26,370
The director of audits report number seventy revealed that an extra contractual settlement sum of two hundred and seventy three million dollars, on a without admission of liability basis, was agreed between the highway department and the contractor in two hundred and one two, in one of the.

45
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:58,820
under the same contract, the committee considers it inexplicable and unacceptable that the Legislative Council have no effective means to monitor such claims and extra contractual settlements between the relevant works departments and the contracted consultants for.
