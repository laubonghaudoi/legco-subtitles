有冇中文？冇中文嘅。

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,460
我想唔想我讀曬佢哋啲名出嚟咧？

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,810
寫翻一、二、三，噉樣睇唔到個直頭。

13
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,280
聽下佢好多好多法學法學院嚟曬，同埋好多團體嚟。

要到有五分鐘，他們他們他們不能進來，所以我希望你們能理解。那是一個鐘頭的鐘，好的。

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:28,850
We have simultaneous interpretation. If you need, you can use the facility. And also, I need to explain to you. I hope we could get your understanding, because nowadays the Legislative Council is just so busy. In the same time slot, we have members who have to go for.

30
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:48,860
three different rooms at the same time 4:30, so they may swap from one room to another. Some may be above, but actually our members are here. But I think because we need to vote in the other room, so I expect they might need.

31
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:26,550
嗯，咁咧就剛才我哋啊，我哋而家恢復會議啦。我哋剛才咧就係嗯誒，已經係決定咗下一次嘅會議嘅議程喺呢度咧。我亦都係要啊同啊委員會宣佈咧，就係我哋新加入咗一位新嘅委員，就係鄭永信議。

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:51,570
而至於下一次嘅開會日期咧，就係啊，我哋係會由啊四月二十三號係改到四月三十號嘅。咁咧嗰個咧主要係誒，因為我誒四月二十三號咧係唔喺香港，咁所以我哋就順延一個星期，咁喺翻四月三十號啊。

33
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,810
同樣嘅時間，啊，四點三十分嘅。

34
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,270
公眾提供嘅法律服務嘅影響。

35

商業學係，亦都有誒香港大學嘅法學院。

36
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,590
會上面討論，咁睇下可唔可以講得切咧，或者睇下會委員覺得有冇需要咧。好好，多謝阿許志峯議員。

37
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:07,240
嘅題目，我亦都希望邀請大家嚟咧，同我哋嘅委員同埋政府咧，分享一下大家對呢方面嘅睇法，或者係一啲要求㗎。

38
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:19,910
咁咧，我哋啊今日相關嘅文件咧，立法會自己啊準備嘅文件係C B括弧四七六二stroke十七-hyphen十八括弧零三。

39
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:49,800
啊！亦都有咧，係啊，中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會嘅，亦都有香港大學學生會法律學會嘅主席，香港中文大學法律學院嘅院會嘅會長。

41
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:15,100
好啦，咁而家咧，我哋就正式進入我哋要討論嘅事項。係你好，阿温兆堅議員係，我係許志峯，係係。啊許，sorry，係啦。我進入去正式討論之前咧，我都想提一提，因為我喺早前咧都誒去咗信律律政司司長，亦都係誒副判。

42
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:35,110
我呢係畀咗個客就關於我想誒喺委員會係考慮下，係咪需要討論我所要求檢討個致命意外條例？噉就因為嗰個誒當中嘅親屬喪亡之痛嘅賠償金額咧，有二十一年冇檢討過，噉就所以我都想諮詢下誒。

43
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:55,120
誒，即係在座委員啦，或者主席、副主席你啦，誒，認為呢一個知名嗰條例個檢討嘅金額咧，需唔需要擺喺未來嘅委員會討論？因為過往歷史上咧，就誒直接就去咗大會，委員會都未討論得切嘅，咁過往就冇乜討論嘅經驗，咁所以睇下大家有冇噉嘅需要。

44
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:15,130
如果唔係咧，我個人嘅都係傾向咧，直接係入大會提出一個決議案去做做修訂嘅。OK，誒，我同我哋可以誒喺今日個會議之後，我哋商討一下嗰範圍咧，一定係屬於我哋誒司法及法律事務委員會嘅範圍。咁最主要咧，同政府傾下，同埋我哋嗰個時間安排。咁喺。

45
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:35,140
誒四月我哋啱啱定咗啦，五六七月我睇下會唔會有一啲時間畀到我哋委員會去討論呢個議題，好冇呢個議題都可以屬於我哋討論範圍，但係我要同律政司嗰邊都商討一下。都畀識，因為如果我呢段時間入決議案畀大會嘅話咧，就會最快喺五月九號嘅大。

46
00:05:41,870 --> 00:06:01,880
誒咁咧，就跟住落嚟，我哋正式進入今日嗰個誒討論事項。誒第一個討論事項咧，就係香港法律專業喺全球一體化趨勢下嘅未來發展，以及有關趨勢對法律專業和向。

47
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:57,720
好啦，咁咧亦都誒講一講今日會議嘅安排。今日咧就誒一共其實有十一個團體代表係報咗名會出席今日嘅會議嘅。首先歡迎大家嚇咁咧就誒誒，我相信今日嗰個題目咧喺法律界裏面亦都係誒一個好熱門。

48
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:27,570
咁咧就誒，我哋係首先歡迎大家啦，亦都咧係誒想同大家講咧，我哋嘅團體咧係啊分別咧就係啊有啊我哋嘅啊根據次序咧係啊樹仁學院嘅啊法律及商。

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,720
咁咧就啊喺。

50
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,920
啊！仲有就係一帶一路國際研究院嘅研究員。

兩位嘅代表就係Mr. Robert Pang同埋Miss Kim Margaret Rooney。

53
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:05,360
或者咧覺得唔足夠嘅時候咧，事後可以補充一啲書面意見，畀翻我哋委員會繼續跟進。

54
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:03,660
亦都有啊！城市大學學生會法律學科聯會臨時行政委員會嘅主席。

55
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:54,230
我就想請咧，就係黃慧聰資深大律師、律政司嘅法律政策專員，首先咧係介紹。

56
00:10:52,410 --> 00:11:03,760
誒註冊外地律師呢一個嘅誒機制啦，咁同埋咧其他咧誒有關點樣誒進入呢個法律專業行業？

57
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:52,130
講出而家香港誒法律嘅專業，分開咗誒律師啦，同埋大律師誒兩個誒主要嘅誒流別。咁另外咧喺我哋誒誒香港特區咧，係誒亦都係有。

58
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:29,630
仲有咧就係啊，我哋城市大學法學院嘅啊代表嘅，咁咧陣間我都會邀請大家一一發言。咁亦都有一啲嘅團體咧，就係啊，我哋有代表出席，包括咧就係我哋嘅專業團體香港大律師公會啦，就係有。

59
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:58,040
現時嚟講咧，我哋首先咧就係啊，想同大家講咧，今日嗰個發言咧，誒，大家嗰個團體嘅代表咧就唔會受到立法會權力及特權條例嘅保障同埋豁免嘅。噉你哋咧亦都可以係啊，口頭去表達或。

60
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:25,650
暫時咧，我哋誒畀各委員嗰個同埋團體代表嘅發言時間咧，希望就唔超過三分鐘。但係由於因為有幾位嘅代表誒，包括咧中文大學法學院嘅院長咧，佢係臨時有事係唔可以出席咧。誒，我哋其實有少少時間係。

61
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:45,660
充裕咗嘅，咁大概都會有十分鐘、十五分鐘嘅時間。咁如果大家咧覺得需要多啲唔多時間咧，我就都會盡量希望大家係可以啊完整嘅去表達咗你哋嘅意見嘅。咁而家咧，我就首先係請政府當局咧係介紹文件，噉。

62
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:15,010
請黃專員，係唔該，主席。首先多謝主席咧，就提出今日呢個會議嘅議題嘅。咁誒，我從主席嘅理解咧，就係希望咧誒法律界啦、誒誒法律嘅學院啦，同埋誒修讀緊法律嘅同學都有個機會咧，係嚟到本委員。

63
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,410
誒。

64
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,350
資深嘅誒律師啦。

65
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,400
啲誒收開嘅收費。

66
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,820
喺呢方面嘅睇法嗱，而家咧，我哋係啊。

67
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,580
設發展呢一方面嘅機遇嘅，咁由於嗰個誒文件咧都誒。

68
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:43,000
誒其實都相當誒易明同埋理解嘅，所以我呢度咧就唔特別誒花委員會太多嘅時間誒逐點噉樣咧係去重複啦。唔該，主席。

69
00:14:52,630 --> 00:15:06,750
實際上誒會代表一啲小人物嘅咧，個機會係好少好少嘅，因為佢哋個個咧誒都係要顧及自己嘅商業嘅誒嘅嘅關係嘅。

70
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:28,050
就算我哋無論幾唔認同佢嘅誒理念啦，或者佢嘅案件，我哋都必須要盡我哋嘅力量去去誒幫佢打一件官司嘅。嗱，依一個誒重點咧係能夠誒。

71
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:35,020
會咧係提出佢哋嘅睇法同埋意見嘅，咁為咗咧係幫助委員會係討論呢個問題咧。誒律政司呢一方面咧就係已備咗一份誒討論嘅文件。咁呢份文件咧其實就唔係太長嘅啫，咁主要咧都係誒比較誒呃要噉樣咧係講。

72
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:24,050
嘅誒一啲標準噉樣嘅，咁亦另外咧，亦都咧係誒提及咧喺係啊全球化嘅發展方面咧，誒香港嘅律師點樣可以投身內地嘅法律服務市場啦？咁同埋咧係誒有關於一帶一路同埋大灣區嘅建

73
00:11:43,400 --> 00:12:03,410
誒，我諗陣間咧就啊，或者我哋都會再畀時間專員嘅誒，因為咧呢個題目咧其實誒，我哋唔係喺本委員會講過好多次嘅，噉我覺覺得可以係另一啲特別係啊，唔係法律界背景嘅委員咧，佢可以比較清楚啊政府嘅意見啦，同埋我哋啊，即係以往。

74
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:27,110
先邀請香港大律師公會嘅代表係誒彭耀雄資深大律師誒發言，係請。係誒唔該，主席各位委員誒噉，我哋誒大律師公會咧就係必須要強調啦，就係雖然喺呢個全球化裏邊咧，誒香港係一個少有嘅誒領域咧。

75
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:47,120
係有一個誒分開嘅誒律師嘅行業服行業嘅噉，但係我哋必須強調一個誒獨立嘅大律師嘅行列咧，係對於我哋誒現行香港嘅法制咧係扮演一個十分之重要嘅角色。我哋誒大律師公會咧係有一個不可。

76
00:12:47,120 --> 00:13:07,130
佢拼嘅規則，我哋所謂cap rank rule，亦即是話咧，任何一位人士咧，如果無論佢嘅誒案件啦，係誒幾唔受歡迎啦，佢自己本人係幾唔受歡迎，如果佢可以誒出得到誒提出一個我哋正常大律師。

77
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,330
一。

78
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,020
預防。

79
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,580
誒，仲有冇其他補充？

80
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,160
Okay，thank you，thank you，Mr. Miss Rooney，我唔。

81
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:34,590
誒同樣都係認為，我哋必香港必須要有一個誒強壯、誒獨立嘅大陸師行列。好。

82
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:42,760
Additional fees for arbitration, which the bar would support, and there's various things we think could be done with the High Court rules, but perhaps we can come back to that.

83
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:22,520
只係出席就唔發言嘅，咁到時我只會讀咗個團體出嚟。咁而家首先咧，我哋就請誒Dr. Claire Wilson，Head of Department，誒，of Hong Kong Shue Yan University。

84
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:54,710
Miss Rooney, you would like to add some of your remarks? Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Vice Chair, Mr. Robert Pang has addressed the general position regarding the bar in Hong Kong. The bar wished to briefly mention a few other matters to do with globalisation.

85
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:32,230
and there should be more promotion of Hong Kong in terms of its legal system, and as a dispute resolution centre. Be it the courts, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, facilitated negotiation, Hong Kong is an innovator in dispute resolution of all forms and dispute.

86
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:25,750
誒，所以我哋係誒認為咧係誒一個係誒十分之重要嘅一個嘅議題，誒甚至乎咧香港律師會對唔住誒都係認同我哋嘅立場嘅誒，噉佢哋應該係亦都有去信咗依誒委員嘅。

87
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:48,340
讓一般嘅市民，任何一一般嘅市民咧，係如果有一個適當嘅案件，可以挑戰，譬如一啲嘅大嘅誒機構啊、大嘅團體啊，甚至乎政府嘅。如果係冇咗我哋依個誒不可拒聘嘅規則咧，實際上誒有有一。

88
00:13:48,340 --> 00:14:08,350
啲嘅誒誒律師流啦，或者如果係誒公司啦，係會好擔心誒佢哋自己嘅誒商為咗商自己嘅商業問題咧，而拒絕代表誒某一啲嘅人士啦，或者甚至乎，如果係誒有一個人係。

89
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:28,440
誒抱住一啲係誒唔受歡迎嘅誒意見而去挑戰法誒政府啊或者其他機構誒，噉佢哋誒嘅可以上到法庭、可以提出嘅意見嘅誒挑戰嘅機會咧，就相繼減少咗好多啦。

90
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:48,490
咁呢個現象咧，其實我哋都可以見到，其實唔係淨係喺誒可以可以喺誒美國啦，誒亦都係誒可以見到嘅。其實佢哋嘅誒Supreme Court誒裏邊咧誒，實際上有獨立誒有有能人嘅誒嘅一啲嘅。

91
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:15,170
And these are, and forgive me if I go quickly because I know there's little time. Globalisation we think provides offers a lot of opportunities to Hong Kong to its people and to its profession, laws including lawyers. And to support that, the bar does respectfully suggest that there should continue to

92
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:54,310
Hong the bar is currently exploring the opportunities presented by the Belton Road in Greater Bay and will be seeking, I think, to say more about that in the future. We are also looking at opportunities provided by the International Commercial Court's proceeding in English, which is springing up around the world, including in Belgium.

93
00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:14,320
已經在新加坡、迪拜和其他中心，而且可能有機會在英國。雖然現在可能看起來有點遠，遠，人工智慧是肯定提供機會給我們專業人士，但同時也帶來挑戰，我們正在研究這個。就法律改革而言。

94
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:34,330
我們支持，當然，法律改革的努力。我們尊重地，我們幫助支持第三方資助仲裁和調解立法的實施，去年通過。我們期待，我們理解，可能在管道中會有一些諮詢。

95
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,320
呀。

96
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,440
then。

97
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,290
My thanks to the panel for.

98
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,710
我 dare say that the

99
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,240
There is no other law school in the world, yeah, which is more internationalised.

100
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:54,030
on a separate issue, the graduates would like to raise a consideration related to the teaching of postgraduate professional legal education.

101
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,850
和， on behalf of those students, I do wish to thank the three universities for providing them with the opportunity to further their legal studies.

102
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:34,480
我 complete my report to inform you that 11 graduates have sought legal education in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United Kingdom.

103
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:45,220
這些figures speak for themselves， and they show that only a small percentage of Hong Kong university graduates continue to pursue a legal career in Hong Kong.

104
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:21,760
Specifically, the graduates welcome more input on the teaching side from practitioners, particularly also in the areas of dispute resolution.

105
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:46,540
Okay, thank you, Dr. Wilson。跟住咧，我哋就係請Professor Michael Ho, Dean, Faculty of Law, Hong Kong University。Please。

106
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:34,970
In short, our institution supports any proposals put forward to open up legal education to allow more students access, and our graduates would welcome a more practically focused approach. Thank you.

107
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:16,320
自從第一批畢業生在2011年，23人被 admit to the JD，12人被 admit to the PCLL，4人被 admit as solicitors in Hong Kong。

108
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:10,630
They suggest that more emphasis could be placed on application and professional skill development, and at this point I would like to support Ms. Rooney's proposition that areas of artificial intelligence and technology could also be absorbed into the curriculum.

109
00:18:44,910 --> 00:19:01,960
Our graduates, so far we've had a total of 344 students that have graduated from the Department of Law and Business at Hong Kong Shue Yan University with a Bachelor of Commerce in Law and Business. So we are different from the three other law schools represented here today.

110
00:17:49,080 --> 00:18:09,090
係，我會宣佈嘅。咁咧就好多謝大律師工會嘅代表，佢哋係先發言㗎。咁跟住落嚟咧，我就會請誒今日嘅團體逐一發言。咁咧就誒，大家有一個次序咧。頭先我亦都係有誒講到㗎啦。咁有一啲團體咧就係誒。

111
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:44,910
多謝主席，和謝謝各位再次給予我這個機會，表達我對蘇燕和我們畢業生的觀點。我今天會盡量簡短，因為我們已經在過去幾次會議中表達過很多觀點。首先，讓我表達一些最新的數據，關於。

112
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,320
We are more than open here to listen to you at any time.

113
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,420
Introduction to Chinese law, yeah, in China, yeah, so we take.

114
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:15,010
香港大學學生會法律學會主席任朗軒先生，請。

115
00:22:47,710 --> 00:23:03,890
Just an example of the the things that we are doing. Yeah, we a number of things are still on the boil and and you'll you'll be hearing about it. I hope. Yeah, in in the next few years. Yeah, I just want to point out the challenge that that is likely to arise because

116
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:14,450
For inviting me, it's a pleasure to be here. Yeah, I want to assure the panel that Hong Kong University is completely committed to globalisation, internationalisation, yeah, and a healthy mainland interaction. Yeah, and in fact.

117
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:43,730
thenHong Kong University. I I don't mean to to be to put down the other two law schools. Yeah, I'm sure that they are they are pretty international as well. Yeah, let me just say that the three law schools yeah among the three most internationalised law schools in the world. Yeah, we have people from all over the world.

118
00:21:43,900 --> 00:22:03,910
envying the kind of internationalisation that we have here. Just just a brief idea of what we do. Yeah, about half of our undergraduate students would have gone for an exchange program to some of our 60 partners. Yeah, six zero. Yeah, and

119
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:23,920
Of course, our faculty is incredibly international. You can, I suppose, you can consider me international. I come from another jurisdiction. And we do all kinds of things, especially in the mainland. And that's it's not receiving the sort of publicity that it should. We have started teaching.

120
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:47,710
50、60學生，and we take them to our partner schools in Shanghai，復旦and East China University of Politics and Law，and they study Introduction to Chinese Law there，and we hope to grow this program，and we hope one day that all our students would would actually go to to the mainland to do Introduction to Chinese Law。

121
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:24,250
There's a limited amount of space. Yeah, there's a limited amount of time. Yeah, in in law school. Yeah, because we cannot forget that our our primary mission is to train competent Hong Kong lawyers. Yeah, in Hong Kong law. Yeah, and that's sometimes can can be a challenge. Yeah, to to do.

122
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:44,260
And also to have a very strong international programme. And at some point, the time and the space is going to be filled up. And we're going to have to decide whether it's going to be this or that. But I think that is a good problem to have. And I look forward to any ideas which anyone has on internationalisation, mainland engagement.

123
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,650
兩樣即係同無論係全球化啦，或者係本地律師行業有關嘅事，多謝主席。

124
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:08,050
好，多謝阿阿張生。咁跟住落嚟咧，就係啊請一帶一路國際研究院嘅研究員啊顧敏康教授請。

125
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:20,110
啊，謝謝主席。三分鐘，啊，只能講幾個point。啊，首先我要指出呢，全球化和區域一體化是一個不可逆轉的一個趨勢。

126
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:57,230
with the legal disputes resolution, and maybe alongside with the policies implemented by the three universities, so that students would be able to get a good grasp of handling arbitration cases. Thank you.

127
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:34,050
那麼，這個全球化和區域一體化也就意味著國際投資和貿易的這個不斷的會增長，也就是需要香港培養更多的涉外律師和涉外法律顧問的人士。

128
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:55,320
Thank you for inviting our society to this meeting. On behalf of the Undergraduate Law Society of the Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, I would like to raise the following concerns over the future development of legal profession under globalisation.

129
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:25,220
額外負擔已經施加在學生身上，因為缺乏明確性。在這個階段，而且有擔憂，它會變得更加困難，讓本地學生能夠在法律界獲得一個位置，因為競爭變得更加激烈。

130
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:10,360
首先，它可見到未來會有更多海外律師在香港註冊。當本地學生畢業於法律學院時，他們可能需要參加新實施的入學考試，這學生們並不熟悉。

131
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:50,030
那麼全球化對香港的法律人才，啊，它有一個特殊的需求的變化。首先，我們感看到啊，這個香港以前這個對英語流利的法律人才是非常需要的。

132
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:38,750
好多謝誒張先生。跟住落嚟咧，我哋係請誒一帶一路國際研究院嘅研究員顧啊啊，sorry，係香港中文大學法律學院院會會長係張傑富先生嚇。

133
00:27:45,710 --> 00:28:04,030
for accessing to PCLL, hence students will have no choice but to complete their studies by deferring, and there is the possibility to further look into transferring credits as a better alternative than deferring, in an effort to encourage students to experience a diverse legal education.

134
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:08,210
Thank you。啊，跟住咧就係我只係想講講就係啊，Mr. Keith Martin Brent，嗯，who is today with us，Secretary International Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong，但係他唔係going to deliver a speech。啊，所以咧就下一位咧，我哋就係請。

135
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:35,300
各位主席，咁多委員、個議會人士噉，首先好希望代表香港大學生會、法律學會，感謝即係邀請我哋出席呢個會議。咁其實咧，今剛我剛才咁多位議會人士都講過啦，其實佢哋對於全球化或者係一啲嘅即係對於法律行業嚟講咧，其實都好重視。而亦都聽到即係可能係港大嘅法律學院啦，其實佢哋對於

136
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:55,310
喺exchange program啦，或者係唔同嘅教學方面咧，都有好多嘅即係貢獻。同埋咧，我係相信咧，即係作為法律學生，我哋喺呢方面咧都好重視。尤其是包括就係頭先講到一啲本科生嘅課程設計啦，一啲嘅國際法、中國法，或者係甚至乎一啲嘅海外交流同埋雙學位計劃。咁其實而家都知道，我哋其實廣大咧都會有一啲嘅計劃係畀我哋去。

137
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:15,320
海外做一個交流，同埋做對啲J.D. program。噉我相信呢啲係誒我哋作為法律學生都好重視噉，亦都好希望即係喺之後落嚟嘅議程，或者係之後嘅時候咧，都能夠有更加多嘅支援畀到我哋喺誒呢一方面咧，等我哋去交流更加多。咁但係誒，除咗之外咧，咁其實我都好想講翻誒，即係本會其實。

138
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:35,330
一直都好關心嘅議題啦，亦都喺過去嘅時候都曾經就呢個議題發過言，就係有關咧誒一個統一統一執業時嘅問題。咁其實我相信誒喺國際喺全球化底下啦，我哋固然要顧及翻即係喺點樣令到香港嘅律律師行業啦、法律嘅行業啦能夠更加去即係發展落去。咁但係我相信喺未來幾年咧。

139
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:55,340
其實都會實施有機會實施呢一個嘅統一執業時啦。噉我好相信誒呢一樣嘢對對於我哋學生嚟講咧，可能係有更加大影響。咁亦都希望即係能夠，無論係政府或者係有關方面，都能夠夠關注呢樣嘢啦。咁亦都我哋都會保持繼續去誒觀望翻。其實嗰份嘅report咧，我睇翻即係個發展到底係點樣。咁而另一樣嘢就係。

140
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,380
stay back in other countries.

141
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,920
之間的區別已經逐漸減少。

142
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,650
看到中國有名的律師事務所不斷地在香港設立分所。

143
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:25,080
內地的香港的企業也普遍需要懂得兩文三語，兼具普通法和內地法律知識的公司律師。

144
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:57,450
我們是否可以考慮將兩者整合？當然，這是一個值得探討的課題。我認為兩者整合的好處就在於能夠增加增強律師的競爭力。

145
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:34,690
去解決法律問題，啊，這就是我的一些觀點。謝謝。好，啊，多謝阿顧教授。跟住落嚟咧，我哋係請香港城市大學學生會法律學科聯會臨時行政委員會主席梁希俊先生請。

146
00:30:44,080 --> 00:31:01,450
香港需要打造成為國際爭端解決中心。香港未來的律師需要兼啊，不僅是成為律師，而且應該成為仲裁員、調解員，這也是一個非常重要的發展的趨勢。

147
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:43,740
第二個，我們就看到目前正在實施的大灣區建設，毫無疑問，大灣區需要制定統一的法律合作框架，需要三地律師的緊密合作，需要法學教育的合作和城市羣的調解制度的配合。

148
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:15,350
有關大律師去實習嘅事宜，噉我哋好希望咧都能夠繼續喺呢方面有得跟進啦。咁亦都係誒對於我哋嘅就業嚟講，甚至乎係即係未來嘅律師行業內點樣去有一個更加健康發展啦，同埋嗰個嘅律師人數啊，或者係市場嗰個嘅分佈嚟講咧，都有好重大影響。所以好希望都喺呢度提翻呢兩。

149
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:45,710
Furthermore, globalisation advocates the idea of exchange programmes for students, such that students could equip themselves with more experiences, better communication skills, as well as an international vision. However, there are 11 mandatory core topics to be covered, which serve as the prerequisite.

150
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:24,500
最後，橫，帶動和路倡議和灣區發展提供強大支援，讓香港設立一個國際法律和爭議解決服務中心在亞太地區。而且，因為《香港仲裁條例》，香港被普遍認可為一個先進的。

151
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:44,510
plays for dispute resolution in the world. As a result, more job opportunities will be expected from these worldwide projects, including important transactions and trades. The concern raised here is whether more resources will be invested in the legal education in Hong Kong, that students will have more opportunities to come into contact.

152
00:29:50,310 --> 00:30:10,320
但是現在，我們看到既能講英文，又能講廣東話，又能講普通話的法律人才，是更受到歡迎。這就説明香港的未來的法律人才，是需要有掌握這樣一些技能。那麼，這裡有兩個重要的證據。第一個，我們已經。

153
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:21,920
第三，我覺得香港未來的法學教育應該擴大生源，實施統一職業律職業考試。律師會啊，打算在將來實施律師統一職業考試，我覺得這個建議非常好。這不僅可以營造三家法學院之間的良性競爭，而且可以使更多。

154
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:41,930
有志成為律師者，提供一個更合理的管道。我尤其認為香港應該開設更多的法律學院，令更多的律師能夠服務於全球化和大灣區各項事務。同時，我也認為目前在香港大律師和事務律師。

155
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,630
If this this may lead to a potential loss of lawyers from Hong Kong, and if this continues,

156
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:33,160
use there shall be a reduction in lawyer count as time passes, assuming setus paribus, and the supply of legal services will gradually decrease in Hong Kong.

157
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:53,280
嗯，好多謝誒，梁先生嚇。噉我哋今日咧係有啊八個團體同埋大律師工會係同我哋表達咗意見㗎。

158
00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:03,220
If there would be some error happening in the area of criminal law, it would be possible that it would lead to the defendant losing his own freedom just due to some poor quality.

159
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:30,280
就係誒撥開咗唔討論住嘅。噉我哋而家咧首要嘅一個誒誒着眼點咧，就係點樣可以能夠盡快咧係呢個第三方資助仲裁呢一方面咧嗰個條例可以最快噉樣實施。咁其實咧誒。

160
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:32,230
條件收費點解咁講咧？相信大家知道，就係其實好多其他國家啊周邊嘅地區咧，啊嘅律師嗰個收費已經係可以有個噉樣嘅彈性。如果我哋係冇噉嘅彈性嘅話咧，確實係喺呢一方面會輸蝕嘅。咁所以我問問呢一個計劃有冇喺度咧？係專員請。

161
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:18,020
那麼第最後一點，我想指出的就是，香港的法律專業人才呢，應該不僅是要注重法律知識的培養，而且應該注重在教學中，介入啊，這個增加學生開發和使用電腦軟件，包括處理判例和法律條文的這樣一些軟件。

162
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:55,160
on behalf of the on behalf of the law students society of the City University of Hong Kong Students Union, I would like to express my greatest gratitude for the panel to invite us to share our views. Now, my learned friends from Hong Kong University and the Chinese University have already shared the points about the opportunities, so I wouldn't like to elaborate on those points.

163
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:15,170
rather I would like to point to possible challenges faced by the Hong Kong legal profession under globalisation. One of the major problems of my concern is that with the influx of with the influx of foreign firms into Hong Kong, there may be a brand effect which will be instilled in Hong Kong people's minds, which they might have a belief that since those firms are from.

164
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:35,180
Other countries which have a much greater common law basis compared to that of Hong Kong, it is possible that they may choose to go to those firms instead of the local firms that are still thriving in the current process. Therefore, it may be now personally speaking, this this sort of competition is quite beneficial to the Hong Kong society, but.

165
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:55,190
我認為政府必須採取措施，確保這種競爭不會變得惡劣，否則最終會損害香港法律界整體。第二，隨著本地學生前往其他國家，尤其是英國，一些人可能選擇留在外國學習法律，因為

166
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:15,200
面對當前香港面臨的巨額競爭，當併合了可能的入學考試的模糊性以及入職法律專業的改革，他們可能擔心無法回港，因此選擇。

167
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:53,640
And when there are less lawyers, it is inevitable that the burden of the legal practitioners that are still here would increase, and this may, due to greater pressure, lead to a decrease in the quality of services. This would be disastrous to the legal system, to the legal services provided in Hong Kong, given that the importance of the quality is that.

168
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:23,660
It would be analogous to the situation in the medical field, and therefore it is a challenge for the legal profession to try and attract students from Hong Kong students who have gone overseas to return to Hong Kong and practice. To conclude, there has been challenges that arose in the course of globalisation, which.

169
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:43,670
如果 not dealt with carefully, may lead to threats that would harm the profession. Ultimately, care must be taken when we deal with these opportunities and charges to the legal profession. Or, as everything that may be implemented have effects that unforeseeable or even detrimental, detrimental to the Hong Kong society. Thank you.

170
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:13,570
咁咧就啊，我就想而家咧先將嗰個嘅時間咧就畀各位委員。咁暫時咧，我哋係有三位委員啦，包括我自己。噉我諗每一位咧，我先畀五分鐘先。咁亦都誒，大家可以係向各位團體嘅代表係誒發問啦，或者咧係問下。

171
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,540
就剛才啊，誒。

172
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,900
至於另外一樣嘢啦，又係關你事嘅，就係嗰個集體訴訟嗰樣嘢啦，可唔可以報告一下嗰個進展係點樣？好，誒。

173
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:04,720
員咧係保持呢個聯絡，同埋希望咧係透過誒呢一個嘅機制咧，盡量聽到業界嗰個聲音，然後睇下咧點樣去再跟進嘅。唔該，主席。好。

174
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:33,580
啊！我哋政府嘅代表嘅噉，其實今日嗰個主題咧，誒比較可以讓大家咧係誒誒比較闊咁去討論嘅。其實就唔唔使話淨係就住一個比較窄嘅議題，睇下我哋啊法律界嗰個喺全球化嘅影響底下咧，究竟係誒即係大家應該點樣走嘅方向？

175
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:53,590
嘅咁第一位咧就係阿郭榮亨議員，係多謝主席。誒，如果講到全球化嘅話咧，我相信最必須要講嘅就係而家嗰個國際仲裁嗰個嘅走勢啦。咁誒誒，大家都知道，我哋過去通過咗幾條同仲裁有關嘅法例，咁呢個都係有助提升香港作為一個仲裁中心。

176
00:36:53,590 --> 00:37:13,600
嘅地位啦。噉我想問問專員咧啊，就住呢一個收費，即係律師收費啊，按條件收費或者按啊啊呢一個啊結果收費啦，會唔會啊作一個諮詢？就係就住國際仲裁或者啊商業仲裁去畀咧律師咧係可以做一個按條。

177
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:52,780
誒，首先咧，好多謝誒副主席啊，郭議員咧，係提出呢個問題嘅。咁呢個問題咧，其實咧喺較早前咧喺立法會咧，我哋係誒有關呢個第三方啊資助仲裁呢一方面有關嘅條例草案通過過程裏邊咧，誒都有討論過嘅。咁個情。

178
00:37:52,780 --> 00:38:12,790
況咧就係誒，我哋首先咧第一個步驟咧，就係當時考慮呢個第三方資助嘅時候咧，首先咧就係要睇咗誒關於仲裁呢一方面啦。第二咧當時咧係的的確確咧係將有關誒收費嗰個方式咧係由於之前法改會咧係曾經考慮過，所以咧就。

179
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:50,790
明朝咧就應該咧會有一個公佈關於誒誒呢個呢個仲裁方面嗰個發展嘅。咁由於誒而家個計劃係明天先係公佈，所以我而家唔可以比較具體噉樣答。咁但係咧誒呢一方面咧誒我哋係著急嘅。咁誒我哋希望咧盡快咧。

180
00:38:52,890 --> 00:39:12,900
誒，Miss Rooney啊，大律師都曾經有提過啦，就係我哋希望咧係盡快咧係喺呢個第三方資助仲裁嗰方面咧，透過誒一個誒法定嘅諮詢過程，可以將誒有關嘅實務守則可以能夠公佈，然後順利咧。

181
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:32,910
可以將嗰個法例咧係推行，咁喺呢一個推行之後咧，我哋希望咧嗰個經驗咧係有助咧，我哋去再考慮誒嗰個收費模式嗰方面。咁同埋喺收費模式呢一方面咧，無論喺仲裁界又好，又或者誒法律界都好啦，我哋都係與誒持份者，即係包括。

182
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:52,920
誒律師會啦、大律師公會啦，同埋相關嘅仲裁機構咧，係保持聯絡嘅。咁誒，尤其是啊郭議員提到有關呢個誒仲裁呢一方面咧，我哋係會繼續用我哋誒已經成立咗嘅機制，就係呢個諮詢委員會同諮詢委員會嘅成員。

183
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:25,440
誒想追問係咪？係保保，即係即係。我聽到專員講就係會去誒落手去諗點樣去推呢一樣嘢啦。咁誒，關於嗰個第三方注重嗰樣嘢，即係我哋大家都希望嗰條法例達盡快可以實施啦。咁其實有啲誒最尾嘅步驟，噉我哋都希望你盡快走完佢啦。咁誒。

184
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:53,430
都講講仲裁先。誒誒，我都有信心咧。聽日有關嘅公佈咧，都應該係正嘅嚇。咁誒誒，關於立誒誒集體訴訟呢個議題咧，誒我都知道誒立法會本身啊，同埋本誒委員會咧都係好關注嘅。咁誒啱啱我哋。

185
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,730
可以回應一下嘅。

186
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,120
或者誒推廣呢啲方面嘅業務。

187
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,280
家嘅完善嘅大學嘅同學係法律係嘅。

188
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:51,640
第日要做律師咧，我哋要準備好將來我哋為我哋嘅客户誒去去辯護嘅對象咧，就係一個AIB型啦。

189
00:40:53,430 --> 00:41:13,440
上阿阿阿雲律師係上兩個禮拜嘛，我哋先開咗上一次嘅會。咁誒，我哋個討論咧係誒都，我又唔敢講好成熟，因為咧誒，我之前答過譬如周議員啊或者其他議員嗰個誒提問都係啦。因為好多時咧誒要討論一啲誒議題嘅時候咧。

190
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:33,450
就可能會誒牽涉，因為嗰啲議題咧係環環緊扣嘅，係會牽涉其他誒可能已經討論過，但係又會受影響嘅議題。咁但係大家可以放心嘅，因為咧我哋就唔係好空泛噉樣喺嗰個相關嘅誒誒委員喺嗰個相關嘅工作小組同埋屬下嘅小組委。

191
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:53,460
會入邊咧，誒好空泛噉樣討論，而事實上咧，我哋喺內部嘅討論過程裏邊咧，係誒的的確確咧係有一個同步係誒條例草案誒嗰個嗰個諮詢草案嘅形式去作討論嘅，咁所以個討論咧其實係相當之具體嘅，咁所以。

192
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:13,470
呢一方面咧，大家唔需要擔心，我哋係誒繼續係有進展嘅。唔該，主席。好，我諗誒喺今屆咧，我哋都應該喺啊之後幾次會有次機會係政府翻嚟匯報嗰啲工作進展嘅時候咧，可能都要準備下呢一方面嗰個進進度嘅問題。我諗委員會嘅成員都係好關心嘅。

193
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:33,510
咁咧就誒跟住落嚟係阿容海欣議員係主席誒。我同意啦，香港法律專業喺全球一體化趨勢下咧有一個誒更加大嘅未來嘅一個發展。噉我想喺兩個層面度講啦，亦都好多謝今日誒在在會嘅所有團體嘅發言啦，畀好多意見。

194
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:53,520
畀我哋噉，我哋睇到咧有兩個層面嘅。其實第一個喺教育上，第二個層面就係喺我哋誒法律專業嘅執業上面點樣可以推進多啲。咁啱啱亦都聽到誒香港大學嘅教授亦都有講誒，其實我哋亦都睇到啦誒。而家譬如我哋誒法律博士呢個專業啦，其實喺香港大學。

195
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:13,530
咧都有一個嘅聯合嘅一個誒program，即係一個學科誒係係同加拿大一間大學啦U.B.C.同埋廣廣大一齊合作嘅。噉我認為咧呢一個即係呢一個類型嘅合作咧係可以推進去點樣可以推進我哋更加多嘅國際投資啊、貿易啊，令到我哋學生咧更加知多啲嘅國際。

196
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:33,540
立法，誒城市大學亦都有啦。我哋國內嘅大學啦，包括人民大學嘅誒碩士課程啦，我諗都係推進我哋，令到香港律師或者香港嘅法律專業咧，可以更加多人去國內發展。噉我睇到誒大學上係有多方面嘅唔同嘅推進嘅。咁喺專業上面，譬如執業上咧，我哋大律師公

197
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:53,550
會亦都有大中華事務啦。阿彭資深大律師咧，都誒之前都有講過有關於相關嘅嘅事務。噉我亦都係關心咧，譬如我哋大律師自己專業咧，去國內其實真係唔易嘅。去國內實習或者去國內誒做執業咧，根本係幾難。話就話可以係誒直。

198
00:43:53,550 --> 00:44:13,560
接可以受聘，但係其實實際有幾多單成功個案咧？我諗我哋自己都未有一個噉嘅數字，亦都冇噉嘅誒一個一個一個數據啦。我哋自己我都覺得大律師公會其實都可能推進多方面嘅呢一方面攞多啲數據，令到點樣令到我哋自己執業者咧？

199
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:33,570
係可以喺國內誒做多啲國內生意啊，或者誒跟進一帶一路嘅議題啊。咁呢方面都可以跟進多啲。咁誒，我我我都想講下有關於我哋大大律師公會嘅守則呢方面，即係誒響推進或者推廣宣傳上咧，我哋誒公會可唔可以畀多啲支援畀我？

200
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:53,580
大律師即係解釋誒，根據啲乜嘢情況下，我哋係可以接其他誒國外嘅生意，或者係點樣先得誒？報税上啊，或者其他執行啊，噉樣我哋都我諗其他嘅誒新進嘅大律師咧，都係歡迎嘅。噉我我我亦都承認咧，誒，我哋香港人或

201
00:44:53,580 --> 00:45:13,590
或者係誒香港大律師，或者香港嘅律師咧，去國內或者國外去執業咧，或者去做其他生意咧，有一個窒礙嘅點，一個就係心理關卡，同埋誒文化上嘅差異。噉我我相信咧，呢方面喺我哋教育上咧，其實都可以喺交流上啊，都可以推進嘅。咁誒。

202
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:33,600
誒就係我開始講啦，兩個兩兩個層面。第一教育上，第二執業上點樣去協助咁？我希望咧，即係唔同嘅專業團體，無論喺國際調解或者仲裁上，誒或者係我哋誒第二時繼續去轉研國際法嘅情況下，咁希望咧各個團體同埋誒學校咧。

203
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,950
誒各方面唔同嘅誒法律層面嘅認識。

204
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:28,240
代表我哋係誒喺香港呢方面，而家係點樣迎接即係呢個機遇或者係挑戰咧？咁呢個第二個問題。

205
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:19,990
咁咧呢呢個同學或者呢一批佢哋喺唔同嘅國家嚟嘅咧，我睇到咧就係佢哋好積極咧，就係諗緊打緊大陸嘅市場嘅主意。

206
00:47:51,940 --> 00:48:09,600
就係一個係啊，嗰啲啊類似係啊誒係機械人嘅一個一一啲出現嘅一個問題。佢係認真噉樣去成個啊presentation，成個分享二十分鐘就係講佢哋研究緊呢樣嘢。

207
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:46,390
第三個問題，我想講嘅咧就係誒，其實我係想都係問下，因為今日咧誒大律師公會嘅代表嚟咗啫，只有，但係我正正咧都想講，因為我首先我都要申報啦，第一我自己都係誒大律師啦，第二我喺城市大學係教法律啊，又教J.D.啦、J.S.D.同埋P.H.D.嘅。

208
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:45,340
可以畀一啲意見，好冇？噉我首先會唔會係都係將我呢個問題畀阿彭資深大律師先，跟住我想問下幾位嘅誒法學院嘅代表喺迎接即係年青人同埋海事啊，或者呢一方面我哋國際法律嗰方面嘅準備工作嚇。

209
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:53,610
或者係其他機構咧，都可以畀多啲嘅支援畀大律師或者律師。唔該。好誒，會唔會係誒彭之森大律師回應下呢個問題？係係誒，我哋誒多謝主席誒，容議員誒，我哋誒大律師公會咧嘅誒誒code of conduct方面咧係有誒相當之一大部分咧。

210
00:45:53,610 --> 00:46:13,620
就係誒好詳細列明喺咩情況之下誒係可以誒直接受委聘誒受聘用啦誒咁如果係一啲嘅誒外國嘅律師係需要得到香港嘅法律意見誒係可以直接誒聘用誒大律師嘅咁依啲依。

211
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:33,630
啲相當啲詳細噉，我亦都好多謝啊，容議員啦提出呢一點啦，或者我哋都會考慮下誒。日後我哋可能會舉辦多一啲嘅誒誒talk啦，就係誒介紹畀我哋嘅誒新晉嘅大律師咧，就係誒如何更加能夠有效地誒去誒接觸誒。

212
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:56,410
多謝楊議員。好，噉係跟住係我嘅時間啦。噉我首先咧就係啊，好多謝大家，尤其是咧就係咁多法律學院嘅同學嚟呢度表達咗意見。噉我就有幾個層面想即係啊，畀大家啊分享下，同埋或者相相關嘅都。

213
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:18,020
第一咧，我想同同學嗰個界面去講先，因為咧近日咧，我都有去過啊一啲國際嘅論壇，係全部都係法學院嘅啊一年班或者二年班嘅同學，咁有其中有一啲係中中歐嚟嘅，誒即係所謂「一帶一路」嘅國。

214
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:41,820
咁咧就我諗時間係計錯咗，係咪啊？同事應該從零開始再計過啦。係啦，嚇應該係已經係另外一位啦。嚇咁咧就誒，我想講先噉啊誒呢一個呢一個嘅分享咧就同阿Miss Rooney頭先講嗰個係好雷近咯，即係佢我覺得咧即係嗰啲同學喺度一路講緊咧就係話我哋。

215
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:40,280
咁所以咧，我就覺得即係我哋嘅法學院，首先咧，即係我點解佢好希望聽到同學嘅意見，就係誒，我覺得咧，我哋喺呢一方面咧係要誒積極啲，點樣咧，再要將嗰個目光係睇未來十年，除咗話所謂全球化之外，就係科技化咧，緊我哋。

216
00:48:40,280 --> 00:49:00,290
個所謂嘅法律服務，傳統嘅法律服務嗰個即係演變，應該係點樣樣？咁第二個問題咧就係海洋法啦，因為咧就係誒海上之籌之路啦。而家即係提出嚇一帶一路，就係有海上之籌之路，好多人都係話香港可以做一個比較強嘅海洋法嘅。

217
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,630
啦。

218
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,760
係彭志森大律師，請嚇。

219
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:43,260
即係呢方面，將來會唔會可以加緊啲睇下？我哋會唔會有一啲嘅誒改革係可以幫到手呢一方面咧？

220
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:49,810
得我知道嚇。如果誒，如果冇即時想回應嗰個問題咧，我會喺第二輪嚇。咁而家就請啊，周浩鼎議員。好。

221
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:38,700
個法例誒去誒畀一啲意見嘅，咁依啲依啲我哋會繼續同埋，亦都會盡量去強化我哋依個計劃嘅。嗯，好啊，其他會唔會想回應先，定係其他同學會唔會想回應嚇？

222
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:20,300
或者海洋嘅法嘅仲裁嘅服務都可以嘅。咁現時嚟講咧，就誒內地做好多嘅喺上海誒，佢有好強嘅一個誒海事法嘅仲裁中心。我哋喺香港呢方面，譬如三大法學院啊，或者我哋喺專業嗰方面啦，我哋今日有國際仲裁中心嘅人喺度啦，佢代。

223
00:49:46,670 --> 00:50:06,680
咁咧，基本上咧，我好想了解一下，我哋其實而家係想諗下點樣幫嗰啲佢其實好有心加入咗大律師行業嘅年青嘅大律師，將要加入大律師行業，因為好中意上法庭。但係同時咧，點樣可以令到佢哋喺內地或者特別？

224
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:26,690
喺誒全球化，我哋話咧，而家咧好多競爭嘅，包括合資企業啊、國際嘅經濟、國際經濟法。我自己都有教合資企業法啦。之前即係點樣可以令到佢哋係誒唔會係受咗侷限啊？因為香港現時嗰個。

225
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:46,700
機制咧，始終就係最後。我見到一啲同學，佢好想做大律師，最後佢話翻畀我聽，兩年之後佢又做翻律師，就係因為咧覺得誒嗰個發展嚇從經濟嘅收入開頭嗰五年太難捱啦。噉我哋點樣可以令到而家國際嘅趨勢其實咧？

226
00:50:46,700 --> 00:51:06,710
全球嘅年青人入法律界，可能都打緊呢個主意嘅時候，我哋點樣協助？報即係律師同埋大律師，佢都係可以有嗰個競爭，而同時我哋又保障到。我好明白嘅大律師佢上庭同埋我哋嗰個。

227
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:26,720
行業係有一個好特別嘅一個，我覺得社會嘅責任嘅。無論律師同大律師，咁點樣可以做到呢一方面咧？咁噉，我除咗即係大律師公會嘅代表，我都希望法學院同埋在座嘅誒，仲有嘅啊法律界嘅代表係可以畀意見嘅。如果你哋想都可。

228
00:51:50,040 --> 00:52:10,050
誒多謝主席。誒就住依個問題咧，誒我哋誒大律師公會咧，就一向以嚟咧都係誒會作一個誒，尤其是誒幫助一啲誒年青新晉嘅大律師咧，就作一啲嘅誒再培訓啦。誒希望咧能夠誒增加佢哋喺誒。

229
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:33,240
誒咁實際少少咧，我誒自己個人都認為咧，其實誒亦亦都認同咧誒顧博士頭先所講嘅啦，就係如果係誒兩文三語咧都係誒貫通嘅話咧，誒對香港大律師誒亦都會係一個優勢嚟嘅誒。噉我亦都個人都亦都希望咧就。

230
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:53,250
就係誒各個誒法律學生啦，就第一樣嘢咧就係誒要鞏固自己嘅語言能力，喺三方面嘅語言誒都係非常之重。如果能夠誒融會貫通三方面嘅語言咧，誒絕對喺誒喺國際層面，尤其是如果係誒跟。

231
00:52:53,250 --> 00:53:13,260
住呢個一帶一路誒嘅商機咧，誒能夠發誒能夠發揮到我哋本身固有誒普通法嘅精神，但係咧就引入去誒一啲誒可能唔係咁慣用普通法嘅誒區域誒，咁依個誒我相信就係我哋嘅誒機會嚟嘅。

232
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:34,180
啊！我我提出啫，可以第日再我哋再跟進，即係喺機制上，即係點可以讓大律師都你知而家律師就嗰個空間好大啊嘛，佢可以合作搞律師行啊，直情係係接好多大嘅project啊。噉我哋好明顯咧，律師就做一個比較個人嗰個，比佢普通法嘅顧問工作。

233
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,350
誒。

234
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,110
專員請，係誒唔該，主席。

235
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,780
二零零三年到現在已經十五年。

236
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,320
跟住係何君瑤議員。

237
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,820
多謝主席，我就誒。

238
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:41,310
我哋能夠為我哋嘅年青學生而家教法律嘅時候，順便咧係做埋誒多功能嘅。

239
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:41,330
咁所以我就喺度提個意見，或者睇下專員會唔會有任何嘅誒回應，可以話畀我哋聽，你哋嘅理解係咪咁咧？或者你哋喺呢方面嘅推進會係點樣處理咧？嚇，唔該啊，主席。

240
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:53,910
誒唔單止淨係考香港嘅律師牌，仲要考埋內地嘅嗰個司法公開考試。嗱，你睇下司牌到現在咧，我哋已經有成。

241
00:53:44,200 --> 00:54:04,210
我哋誒大律師公會咧，亦都係過往咧誒有同一啲誒國內嘅誒律誒有一個誒同國內嘅律律師協會啦，誒就有誒好緊密嘅聯繫嘅。誒噉我哋誒誒亦都可以從誒從誒律政處方面講。

242
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:24,220
嗰誒嗰個意見書啦，可以見到啦。誒大律師公會亦都係有誒一個機制咧，就誒可以誒委派一個或者一個誒國內嘅律師行咧，都可以聘用一個香港嘅大律師咧作為顧問嚟到誒就住香港。

243
00:54:50,090 --> 00:55:10,100
誒唔該啊，主席，噉就有兩樣嘢啫。第一就因為頭先提到嗰個集體訴訟嘅發展啦，噉啊，即係基本上因為過去法改會亦都幾年前已經有個報告係講推進香港嘅集體訴訟咧，首先可能先試點咁講啦，就從消費者嗰個集體訴訟，亦都可以取。

244
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:30,110
個平衡啦，因為商界可能對於個營商環境嘅影響，佢哋亦都會有啲關注。噉我諗取個平衡咧，消費者嗰個集體訴訟咧就比較相對嗰個可行性或者嗰個探討性會比較高啲。咁主要喺度提嘅意見咧，就係當然即係專員都唔需要而家呢刻答我嘅。不過過去你都正如你所講，即係。

245
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:50,120
喺立法會嘅大會嘅層面，喺唔同層面，我哋都問呢個消費者嘅集體訴訟。誒，究竟係幾時？你哋如果喺小組嗰個會議經過好多次，有啲階段性嘅進展，可以同翻我哋嘅委員會報告咧。咁都期待你未來嘅時間有一定嘅進展，會翻翻嚟話翻畀我哋聽嘅。咁呢個就第一點。

246
00:55:50,120 --> 00:56:10,130
點啦嚇誒第二點咧，就係關於嗰個誒，我哋啊誒，即係律師嘅行業喺內地嗰個誒工作嗰或者拓展業務嗰方面嘅問題嗱。其實咧，我就誒睇到咧，立法會為我哋準備嗰份文件裡面嘅其中誒有啲內容就提過咧，截至到二。

247
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:30,140
二零一八年嘅三月一日咧，我而家香港同內地嘅律師事務所獲準誒設立咗十一家嘅合夥聯營嘅誒誒誒律師行嘅，咁有七間咧就喺前海，有兩間喺啊廣州，有兩間又喺珠海。咁另外咧，原來就一八年一月，亦都廣東省政府係宣

248
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:50,150
報咗咧，就可以係啊，設立嗰個合夥聯營嘅試點，去擴大到成個廣東省嘅嗱。我主要就想有個意見提出咧，就係誒過去咧，其實我哋特別係見到有啲中小型嘅律師行嘅行家咧，都多番提出就係話誒，有時佢哋碰到嘅問題就係大門開。

249
00:56:50,150 --> 00:57:10,160
開小門就未開，點解咁講咧？可能就係話誒，內地政府可能畀咗一個政策話支援啊啊，鼓勵佢哋上去開業，但係咧有一啲去到真係賣門嘅時候，有啲實際嘅情況困難咧，碰到咧佢解決唔到。例如舉個例，個股權嘅分配，例如話可能內地嘅律師。

250
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:30,170
行咧誒，如果你同佢夾咧，佢始終要揸可能超過五十一嗰個股權。咁並咗嚟講，我哋本地有啲律師嘅行家咧，就會感覺即係可能覺得誒未必好啊，有信心即刻噉樣做，即係佢希望可能睇下會唔會有機會呢方面咧係有所改變噉樣。

251
00:57:44,790 --> 00:58:04,800
領導，唔該，主席。聽到好清楚。誒，剛才啊，周議員咧誒講得冇錯嘅。誒，法改會嗰個建議同埋我哋目前嗰個工作誒誒小組咧，就正正就係針對呢個誒消費者方面嗰個集體訴訟咧，係做功夫嘅。咁所以呢一方面咧，周議唔需要擔。

252
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:24,810
心噉啊！另外一樣嘢咧，就係關於誒香港嘅律師誒，如果想誒打入內地市場嗰方面，咁誒剛才講到其中一個問題，就係關於嗰個股權分配啊、誒資金啊等等。咁呢一啲嘅問題咧，誒律政師同埋。

253
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,310
誒。

254
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,750
好唔該，誒首先咧，關於嗰個誒。

255
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,490
仲有一樣嘢，而家仲喺度搞緊話誒第三十一段。

256
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:06,040
將製造到好多嗰啲障礙性嘅問題，驚呢船頭驚鬼船尾怕黑。咁人哋全世界都以LLP行得好啊，所以呢個corporation。

257
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:55,550
應該呢個噉嘅mindset咧，一定要改三樣嘢喺我哋嗰個法律嘅構建基建嘅infrastructure嗰度咧，我哋嘅大學應該而家要籌備為我哋。

258
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:24,110
整嚟都冇用添，有人話根本都畀LLP replace咗。咁但係我覺得唔係，都要做嘅多啲選擇。而家人哋講緊MDP啊，multi-disciplinary practice。咁所以喺噉嘅情況裏邊，我哋嚴重滯後。講到我哋嘅practice嘅mode啊，咁嗰個形式，即係我係同個專員講。

259
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:56,160
誒好保守，你哋淨係搞LLP都已經搞成十年，誒講呢個solutions corporation搞廿一年仲未搞掂。唔好意思，我仲係chairman of呢一個噉嘅嘅嘅committee in誒in North Side啊。咁但係我哋往往做咗出嚟嘅時候咧，好多挑剔嘅嘢。

260
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:44,820
律師會同埋其他持份者咧係保持聯絡嘅。咁相關嘅誒建議同埋相關可以誒更加便利香港嘅法律執業者可以投入內地市場呢一方面咧，我哋係透過super嗰方面咧係同內地磋商嘅。咁由於呢啲問題咧都仍然喺呢個。

261
00:58:44,820 --> 00:59:04,830
個誒磋商嘅階段啦，所以而家咧就唔方便咧喺呢度咧就公開噉樣討論。咁但係咧誒，亦都希望周議員係唔需要擔心嘅，因為相關嘅當初提提出啦，或者其他相關嘅問題咧誒，我哋咧都喺個議程入邊咧係同內地咧係保持住聯絡嘅。唔該，主席好。

262
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:32,920
我我認為咧，香港我哋自己不能夠獨善其身。噉我亦都覺得係話，面對於全球一體化，即係呢個法律專業一體化嘅呢個大前提下邊咧，我哋真係一定要去加快步伐。我有三點去希望同大家分享下，就以大學嚟講咧，誒，若果。

263
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:17,150
寥寥可數得一百一十七名香港居民係攞到內地嘅執業資格，而呢個一百一十七名當中，裏邊咧係有雙重身份係香港律師而考到嗰個嘅咧，我諗少於一半添啊！我我按照我嘅記憶咧，得三十零人係有誒Jew Qualification。

264
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:37,240
嗱，如果我哋三間大學或者甚至乎樹人都好啦，開始籌辦我哋教我哋自己四年嘅學科嘅時候咧，亦都為我哋嘅新一代咧製造埋，爭取到考到呢個全國司法公務考試啦。呢個有變有利於我哋嘅人才嘅嗰個出路。第二咧，我哋律政署嗰度咧，實際上唔好意思。

265
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:44,400
人哋內地又有CFA，英國又有CFA，而家香港我哋先談到arbitration third party分定噉，然後講到civil litigation裏邊咧，我哋應唔應該畀呢一個噉嘅CFA咧？仲喺度行三步就褪四步，即係冇進步，仲要褪後添。噉我哋係咪應？

266
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:15,840
新青年有新出路，而我哋嘅Department of Justice咧，唔好講話Class Action啦。我哋Solicitor Corporation都搞咁耐，我覺得真係好嚴重滯後。呢個好高興啊！即係唔知係我哋A J O S提出呢個問題，還是係佢Department of Justice整出嚟噉。但係我覺得應該要做，應該要諗。

267
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:40,880
我哋仲喺度搞緊話，包括第五屆嘅香港法律服務論壇呢啲已經嚴重落後過時嘅嘢。你叫我去我都唔去添。已經早喺二十年前咧就會好有興致勃勃。今日我哋仲喺度上邊話話畀人聽，我哋要香港做arbitration，點好你過嚟啦噉樣。咁咁點樣？

268
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:30,480
其他地方度，如果我哋仲係，我就對唔住阿阿阿彭大律師，我。

269
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:04,380
研究，不過同埋我或者都講少少意見咧，因為誒，剛才聽到大家嘅意見，包括我哋委員嘅意見咧，其實我覺得我哋誒。

270
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:36,750
訴訟人嘅廣大公眾利益嘅咁呢一方面，我哋小心。最後一點，唔好意思，要快啦嚇，就係關於誒正話所講嗰啲推動誒。

271
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:35,300
好得啦，我諗咧就誒我誒跟住落嚟要畀謝偉俊議員發問啦，因為咧今日我哋都應該算係有足夠時間嘅，我就寬鬆咗誒寬鬆少少嘅嚇，因為我都可以容許第二輪嘅。咁咧而家咧就係阿謝偉俊議員請。

272
01:02:40,880 --> 01:03:00,890
兩張係咪先係你又冇contingency fee嘅嘅嘅arrangement？喺而家又啱啱個some party點啦，你過嚟啦咁噉。但係我喺內地裏邊已經有華南㗎啦，我哋都有呢一個北京嘅國際仲裁啦。我哋點同你爭咧？好啦，除此之外，噉你仲有咩sell listing？噉我如果嚟就嚟㗎啦，你都唔使你唔使。

273
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:20,900
睇佢sell你嘅legal service㗎，因為呢個stock market O K，我會過嚟。咁整落嚟仲有乜嘢咧？Nothing冇㗎啦，除咗mediation同埋呢一個listing commercial嘅嘢冇㗎啦。咁所以我就希望咧就係真係要認真諗諗呢一度。多謝。啊，想唔想專員回應啊？係專員請回應。

274
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:46,660
內地司法考試嗰方面啦，咁誒呢一方面咧，我相信誒各間大學嘅法律學院咧，會有佢哋嘅考慮嘅。因為我都聽到有同學誒，剛才有表達，即係話可能佢選科方面咧都有啲限制啦，因為嗰個時間關係。咁呢度咧誒，如果有需要咧，我。

275
01:03:46,660 --> 01:04:06,670
誒絕對相信咧，有關嗰個誒我哋叫Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training嗰個上次委員會咧，係可以誒討論嘅。而正正咧，嗰個委員會咧，亦都係委任咗誒顧問係同各個持份者咧係誒研究緊誒。

276
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:26,680
相關嗰個問題嘅噉啊，另外咧誒，我哋唔同意咧誒律政司咧就嗰個誒誒律師嗰個誒執業嘅模式咧係保守嘅誒。事實上咧，剛才阿何議員所講咧有關誒有限法律責任。

277
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:46,690
任嘅合夥人咧喺實施，應該如果冇記錯，二零一六年三月實施之後咧，誒其實無論係本地嘅律師行，即係香港嘅律師行啦，亦都係一啲誒外地律師，即係我哋叫foreign lawyers，即係唔係講緊國際行定本地行嗰個意思啫，真係執業香港法律同埋執業。

278
01:04:46,690 --> 01:05:06,700
外地法律嘅律師行咧，誒嗰個誒數目咧都係持續增加嘅。咁另一方面咧，就係有關誒律師嘅公司所組成嗰方面咧，誒嗰個誒以我哋嘅理解咧，就係誒而家咧係律師會咧係努力噉樣咧係誒準備緊。

279
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:26,710
相關嘅附屬法例咁之後咧，誒如果係得到誒中審法院嘅首席法官嘅同意嘅時候咧，誒相關嘅附屬法例咧就可以呈上誒立法會誒，到時咧就可以以附屬法例嗰個誒方式咧係可以誒。

280
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:46,720
誒誒誒立法噉，然之後咧就可以實施㗎啦。咁誒另外咧，就關於誒嗰個收費模式呢一方面咧，誒主要嗰個障礙咧，其實就係上一次誒都相當年之前啦，但係主要咧都係誒法改會嗰個報告咧。

281
01:05:46,730 --> 01:06:06,740
之後，誒律師會咧認為嗰個跟進係有困難咧，主要係由於咧係誒英文咧所謂after the event insurance，即係話誒點樣可以有一個誒誒現疏咧係可以保障誒嗰個敗訴一方咧係可以。

282
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:33,580
誒第幾段啊？誒第。

283
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,740
正話所講十一家嗰度廿一同廿五元。

284
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:43,520
第十六段係唔該，第十六段誒有十一家嗰啲咧，全部都喺廣東省嘅。

285
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:26,940
誒支付勝訴嗰一方咧嗰個誒重費嘅噉，但係無論如何啦，就呢一方面咧，誒我哋必須咧從律政司嘅角度咧考慮係要誒小心嘅，因為除咗要睇誒誒法律界嘅利益之外咧，同時亦都要好小心咧，要睇嗰個消費者嗰個利益同埋其他。

286
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:57,220
誒嘅活動，咁呢啲活動咧，其實我哋馬不停蹄咧，同埋點解我哋繼續做咧？係誒好明顯係有需要嘅，因為各個誒法律嘅誒兩個法律專業團體啦，誒有關嘅仲裁同埋誒調解嘅機構都好踴躍誒去。

287
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:17,230
去參加，而當地參加嘅人咧，亦都係相當多嘅。上一次誒文件所講喺南京嗰個咧反應係好熱烈嘅，有八百人參加嘅。咁呢啲咧，我哋絕對唔同意咧係誒嚴重滯後，同埋唔同意咧誒呢啲誒或者講得俗啲咧，即係呢啲呢啲唔係冇嘢sell嘅。

288
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:56,150
主席，首先好多謝咁多位嘉賓幫我哋誒畀意見啦。咁但係由於真係個課題非常之闊嘅，咁三分鐘係完全唔公道嘅。啲你講特別係剛才我誒留意到啊，特別阿顧教授咧，其實好多點關於特別係誒特別譬如話統一考試啊，或者係誒fusion啊呢啲問題咧，好大嘅課題咧，其實我哋應該深入。

289
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:24,970
除非有個好大嘅一個所謂嘅destruction，一個破壞性嘅災難性嘅嘅推動力，否則嘅話咧，香港嘅律師行業咧，仲係喺度好保守地，仲係講緊唔好意思講緊cap rent rule。大佬啊，我哋一講緊係全球化，一帶一路，起碼都講緊即係點樣一係就多啲人入嚟，一係就出去。

290
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:50,770
我唔知你哋有冇記錄咧，有邊一位bar嘅member咧曾經試過係有人complain過佢cap ring rule係違反咗，於是係有一個discipline hearing咧，as far as notice none。變咗之後，呢個係一個好理想嘅，即係北極星又好，你話係一個民主理想又好咧，講嘅啫，但係真係做咧係做唔到嘅，即係一千個理由咧唔接。

291
01:08:50,770 --> 01:09:10,780
個case啊，即係你永遠都捉唔到一個大律師咧，違違反啲cap law咧，於是係受受誒規範。噉我覺得呢啲，我哋而家關鍵嘅問題就係點樣能夠喺而家今日課題咁大、全球化，跟住又好多根本係誒，無論係人哋供我哋好，我哋供人哋好咧，好多嘢要諗要做嘅。唔好講話你香港本身，你講嘅大。

292
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:30,790
灣區再進而係一帶一路，再進而係整個大陸，再進而係全球化。我哋嘅language，我哋common law，唔好講話即係好多super嗰啲。剛才我同意何君如所講咧，我哋好多嘢根本仲係唔落地嘅，即係嗰啲小龍門冚冚唔開嘅。得個港字，我由day one開始practice，所以聽講super呢樣。

293
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:50,800
嘢噉就係講到而家究竟有幾多個lawyer真喺大陸揾到食？除咗話係真係打工嘅，除咗話係大老細大嘅firm誒，對唔住大嘅生意人咧，帶埋佢去做下個一個second consulting之外，有幾多lawyer真係可以喺大陸有個好嘅practice咧？即係我未見過誒，人哋嚟香港人哋大陸咧都係因為人哋。

294
01:09:50,800 --> 01:10:10,810
U.S. firms啊，U.K. firms啊，European firms啊，佢哋本身有businessman insist堅持話，佢哋本身當地嘅lawyer參與一份咁先有得做啫嘛。如果我哋靠香港律師開firm，等人揾我哋執梗啦，即係所以，我覺得呢啲即係唔係好實際嘅。即係我我亦都當然唔怪D.O.J.啦，因為你哋政府部門好多嘢要審慎。

295
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:30,820
冇講律師咁複雜啦，咁多jurisdiction問題，咁多language問題，咁多誒conflict laws嘅問題。醫生咁簡單入唔到嚟啦，即即人都係一個啫，law就好多種嘅，但係都仲係咁難嘅。咁即係呢啲有排都講唔曬。不過擔心在乜嘢咧？就係我哋如果唔能夠好啲準備，我哋無論係學生方面。

296
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:50,830
某程度上，何君義員所講嘅話，學一同時學兩樣law咧，可能比較兩樣法律咧，可能係比較係誒進取一啲，因為考兩個牌咧真係唔容易，一次過讀書搞掂香港嘅法律本身都唔容易。但係呢個題，如果真係將來想行一條路嘅話咧，的而且確你要早啲諗呢個問題，無論嘅語言方面，我哋法律體係方面，我哋甚至。

297
01:10:50,830 --> 01:11:10,840
乎而家剛才有提過關於A.I.方面，誒將來好盛行趕法律師冇得做㗎啦，因為會replace by所有呢啲誒，我哋唔夠人鬥嘅，即係捉棋一樣啦，我哋冇得玩嘅。我哋唯一叻嘅就係話，我哋點能夠可以將喺即係人情化啲嘢誒，盡早可以誒掌握咗啲A.I.幫我哋手，然後我哋做翻個。

298
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:02,070
誒。

299
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,500
誒，關於第誒。

300
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,650
嚇就喺誒三分鐘啦嚇。

301
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:03,290
有一段係個人嘅嚇，係大律師個人嘅嚇，咁所以兩條數係分開嘅嚇嚇。

302
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:07,990
咁誒就住依方面，我哋想回應嘅就係咁多。

303
01:15:50,520 --> 01:16:01,070
型嘅模式咧，就能夠令到我哋大律師誒，任何一個人都係可以揾到一個適合嘅大律師咧，去打任何一個案件嘅。

304
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:30,230
佢哋咧就互派律師嘅，咁所以嗰條數就係喺呢一度嘅。係好，誒彭志森大律師會唔會想補充回應？多謝主席。誒謝議員。誒其實我誒。

305
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:58,100
咁呢啲就係誒合夥誒聯營，咁呢個合夥聯營同之前嗰個措施有咩分別咧？嗰個進展咧就係呢個合夥聯營嘅措施咧係可以誒誒分賬嘅，咁所以咧就係第二段你係講個人嘅喎。

306
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:41,610
誒，亦都擺埋喺呢條數咧。以我嘅理解咧，就冇特別分開佢哋本身之前係唔係誒內地移居咗香港成為永居永久居民之後，再攞到呢個資格嘅。我唔知阿張小姐誒，可唔可以張小姐有冇補充？

307
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:57,940
誒多謝主席單嚇，係廿五段嗰度嗰個香港永久性居民咧，就係淨係講佢而家申請嘅時候嘅身份。噉佢之前係咪要通過單程證嚟香港咧？呢個就冇特登再有個分誒分別嘅數據嘅。噉我都補充下就廿一段啦，嗰個誒。

308
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:30,850
master，然後立being a certain咁解啫嚇。我哋隨時隨時輸嗰啲層障都，咁依啲含埋我哋好多課題需要處處理準備嘅。咁無論係學校方面，似乎聽唔到太大嘅一啲嘅突破。關於呢方面誒，或者係誒行業方面，好可惜連律師會都唔嚟添啦，就係律大律師公會啦。咁咁誒D.O.J.更加係啦，連連。

309
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:50,860
即係今冇咩可以做得到嘅噉，我我我睇翻你哋個記錄啦，或者我趁翻少時間都停停問一問噉，你答答啦嚇。有排講嘅呢個課題，你哋所講嘅，譬如話截至二零一七年三十誒一誒為止咧，有幾多一百一十七位誒香港居民係屬於係誒廣東省嘅律師。我想了解下，其實呢個。

310
01:11:50,860 --> 01:12:10,870
數字係咪佢哋係香港人？但係其實主要係one-way traffic單方面為止，就係內地嘅人嚟香港，同時做埋香港居民之後做到律師嗰個數字啦，定還是我理解香港律師上內地做嘅就絕無僅有嘅。剛才威然講卅幾個，我相信可能冇咁多添，因為呢個係一個好大嘅一個障礙。第二咧就係。

311
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:30,880
話誒，你哋講關於嗰個誒legal consultant喺大陸law firm度咧，到轉bar surprising要三十幾三十個以上啊，律師得兩個，我就唔知啲數字係點樣得嚟。究竟我哋有冇一個或者先研究問題嘅宗誒個問題嘅症結咧？瞭解我哋數字上有啲乜嘢，我哋而家係係幾幾誒幾？

312
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:50,890
幾有限嘅先，然之後希望先從一個比較實質上嘅，就唔好太多講一啲唔落地嘅一啲議題。噉我我哋冇得做。好，我都畀翻多少少時間你啊，畀阿專員回應先。咁會唔會阿彭資深大律師都想回應一下？我哋先請專員。好，唔該。就第廿一段嗰個數目咧，呢個數目咧就。

313
01:12:50,890 --> 01:13:10,900
因為咧，誒，我哋掌握到咧係一啲個別嘅大律師係可以喺內地嗰度係擔任喺個律師事務內地嘅律師事務所擔任顧問嘅數目。咁呢個數目咧就有別於咧香港嘅律師，因為通常香港嘅律師咧佢就未必會個人上去內地嘅，通常咧係一。

314
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:30,910
個香港嘅律師事務所同內地嘅律師事務所係合夥經營嘅。咁呢啲情況咧，所以係兩條數嚟嘅。咁誒而所以點解咧？喺大律師咧就係以個別個人嘅名義，我哋可以數到幾多位。咁但係以律師嚟計咧，就係以嗰個律師行啦，或者個律所啦。咁呢個就係誒另外問。

315
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:26,790
二十五段嗰度，以我嘅理解咧，個數目咧係誒講緊係香港擁有永久居民身份。但係呢啲喺香港擁有永久居民嘅人咧，佢哋係誒之前係唔係有內地嘅户籍，然後移居香港作為香港永久居民之後誒，然後。

316
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:18,330
誒大律師作為誒呢一個誒法律顧問啦。咁另外誒律師方面咧，其實一般而言，律師就唔會通過呢個大律呢一個scheme咧，就用skip嘅，因為skip入邊咧誒律師自己本身咧，另外咧就有一個優惠措施，就係誒一個內地律所可以誒同埋一個本地所咧就可以。

317
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,980
咁咧就唔緊要，未準備好咧，就真係要急起直追。

318
01:20:53,590 --> 01:21:01,120
啊！呢個真係畀我一個好清晰嘅，噉我答何君瑤議員咧，呢個題目咧係誒我哋委員會自己提出嚟。

319
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:53,310
啊，首先咧就係啊，我必須要講啦，我係認為係律政司喺呢一方面咧係未準備好嘅。

320
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:44,870
嚟嗰個中心嘅地位啦，就係要靠呢啲噉樣嘅改革。咁所以希望大家可以一齊去啊，去進行呢啲改革，亦都係盡快去睇我哋點樣去進啊去做咯。多謝主席。

321
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:44,800
係有啲噉嘅建議，但係亦都唔係侷限咧，就係話誒律師行嗰個問題。第二個咧就即刻跳去咧，就係得國際仲裁啦噉樣。即係其實咧兩樣嘢咧，完全只係喺而家，我覺得香港咧，我哋一定要正視咧個洪流嚟緊啊！

322
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:50,520
認為咧就其實呢個cap rank rule不可拒聘嘅規則咧，誒係相當之重要嘅。誒咁當然咧係要同呢個大律師獨立經營係相輔相成。咁呢個不可不可拒聘嘅規則咧，誒除咗係誒有一個實際嘅精神上嘅作用咧，加埋加上呢個獨立經營。

323
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:28,630
係，阿謝偉俊議員，你講乜嘢？有冇數字啊？實有冇具體嘅數字？會唔會有一啲數字咧？誒，我手頭上就冇依個數字嘅，咁或者我哋翻去如果有嘅補充畀我哋委員會，好冇？好嘅，唔該，多謝。多謝。咁跟住咧就係第二輪啦。第二輪咧，首先就係阿郭榮亨議員同埋我啦。我諗我哋儘量啦嚇。

324
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:52,220
係主席誒，我想問就係即係誒，其實頭先呢有幾位人士，譬如包括顧教授啊，啊都講話係咪需要而家考慮合併誒，大律師同律師嘅行業咧？我自己本人就非常之反對合並。我認為頭先啊，大律師工會嘅代表講得好清楚就係，其實大律師呢個行業咧係對於啊。

325
01:16:52,220 --> 01:17:12,230
香港嘅法治係一個好非常之重要嘅一個啊地位啦。咁但係雖然係咁講，但係謝偉俊議員頭先講嗰個啊，即係啊，大律師行業係咪需要啊睇下點樣去改革咧？呢一個確實係啊非常之有道理嘅啊。我知道大律師公會喺今屆啊都係已經考慮緊啦。

326
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:32,240
研究緊係誒將嗰個誒大律師嗰個誒訓練咧變成係有償薪嘅，即係pay pupilage。咁呢一樣嘢係一個誒需要嘅改革。咁但係咧呢一個本身係唔夠嘅，即係確實而家好多年青大律師咧，佢哋都係啊啊揾工作係非常之難啊，尤其是係誒年輕五。

327
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:52,250
至七年之內嗰啲噉啊，好多時我哋都喺度問，究竟點樣可以幫到佢哋咧？咁喺英國，我哋見到嗰個經驗就係啊七年以下嘅大律師係可以直接接啊客人嘅案件。某一啲案件唔係大嘅案件，可能係一啲比較細嘅民事案件啦。其實啊，大律師喺英國都已經係。

328
01:17:52,250 --> 01:18:12,260
係可以接咁見到佢哋嗰個經驗就係佢哋冇需要去完全合拼啊，但係佢仍然係分咗兩個有barrister有solicitor，即係大律師律師嘅分別。但係咧，啊大律師係喺某啲情況之下可以直接接案件嘅。咁呢啲考慮咧，其實都要去諗下㗎啦。因為如果你真係想幫年輕嘅大律師係走出而

329
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:32,270
而家嗰個困境嘅話咧，確實要諗啲步伐大啲、大膽啲、闊啲嘅一啲一啲嗯考慮。噉我希望啊啊啊彭大律師同埋阿Kim Rooney咧，可以將呢啲意見帶翻去大律師公會嘅執委會嗰度去考慮一下。噉你唔需要今日答我，都係因為呢啲係好複雜嘅。

330
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:52,280
問題噉啊。至於其實另外一樣嘢就係，即係我想同啊D.O.J嘅同事講咧，就係其實其實嗰個法律改革嘅步伐係好緊要。嗯，其實我喺唔同嘅誒方面咧，都有同政府嘅部門去傾法律改革啦，尤其是我哋嘅金融啊條例啊，誒或者係呢一個嗯啊。

331
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:38,410
實際上，香港就寸金尺土，地方唔夠。

332
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:57,130
無論嗰個科技化快過係整我哋整體法律嘅行業，甚至法學院係要諗緊，我哋流唔流到一啲優質嘅年青人去肯入。

333
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:34,720
挑剔又呢樣又嗰樣，噉我覺得呢樣嘢好好好真係好戇居。如果已經有十幾年嘅佢有呢個噉嘅誒誒civil litigation practice的話，或者係有有出庭嘅嘅嘅經驗，你咪畀佢咯，limited practice。

334
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:34,000
噉我覺得呢個議題一定唔係今日可以解決得到嘅。咁A.I.嘅挑戰咧，就人人都有嘅。噉我哋係咪喺法學院應該要係啊清晰啲咧？噉我我我我覺得咧呢個咧，我係好想聽嘅。陣間就畀你哋各個團體最後回應啦。

335
01:18:52,280 --> 01:19:12,290
企業嗰個嘅啊債務重組啊、debt corporate debt restructuring啊等等，我都有同FSTB嘅同事去講嘅。咁其實我哋想帶出嘅就係咩咧？就係如果香港嗰個誒法律改革嘅步伐係滯後嘅話咧，其實呢個係大大影響我哋嗰個競爭力，最影響我哋嗰個誒法律中心嗰個競爭力，因為如果你法

336
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:32,300
律制後落後嘅話咧，其實呢啲係誒將好多誒投資者或者好多誒做生意嘅人咧，其實都唔會選擇誒喺香港做誒合約或者做投資或者做其他嘅買賣，因為我哋嘅誒法例咧係冇追上潮流。咁所以即係我記得誒司長誒上一位。

337
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:52,310
司長袁國強司長佢講過話，佢想將呢一個法律改革更加步伐推快，啊更加專業化。咁呢個當然係好啦，但係如果政府嘅部門仍然係唔肯去盡快落實一啲啊法改會嘅建議嘅話咧，其實呢個都係枉言嘅。因為人哋做咗個報告書，你坐喺度十年都唔做嘢嘅話，咁其實呢個係亦都係嘥。

338
01:19:52,310 --> 01:20:12,320
嘥精神同埋嘥時間嘅，咁所以呢一呢一個我哋我哋真係希望要大家睇睇。另外一樣嘢就係司法機關嘅同事唔喺度啦，但係嗰個司法機關嗰個誒審後案件、輪候案件嘅時間實在太耐啦。我識好多嘅誒打官司嗰啲嗰啲人，佢哋都話：我我點解要嚟香港打官司啊？等三年四年。

339
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:32,330
我都冇冇個冇個判詞嘅咁呢一個其實大大影響咗香港嗰個嘅誒誒呢一個誒作為法律樞紐嗰個中心嘅地位。其實其實呢啲嘢咧，即係我叫佢做the nuts and bolts of the rule of law，就係咧講法治當然好重要，但係法治要點樣可以真係彰顯到，同埋點樣我哋可以發展到我。

340
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:26,300
咁咧，首想講咧，提呢個議題出嚟咧，誒，我就中間就發現咧，就係有兩種嘅誒反應。一咧就大家以為咧，就係淨係喺度討論係咪要合併嘅問題。其實呢一個議題係絕對完全超出，可能只係其中有可能有啲會。

341
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:17,480
法律呢個行業，因為咧有太多其他嘅行業咧係有高度嘅吸引力。第二咧，亦都係同樣我自己係好愛我，無論律師或者大律師，我自己即係咁多年咧，即係喺城大睇住好多年青人都分別入兩個行業，真係好希望佢哋嗰個。

342
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:37,640
機會喺將要面對嘅機會咧，係可以更加多。噉我呢個只係客觀嘅觀察咧。律師咧，的確咧就係頭先張小姐所講咧，絕對應該超出你哋畀我嘅數字。希望我自己認識嗰啲律師行咧，好多已經係好多合作係接好多大嘅企業嗱。

343
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:57,650
嗱，我認為大律師咧，如果佢個人嚟講，佢有嘅，因為譬如我自己都係好熟誒內地嘅法律圈，咁好多時佢會自己直接揾我哋嘅。但係我係諗緊係整體咧，我哋會唔會諗緊一樣嘢？唔好諗合併啊！諗緊係點樣我哋能夠記？我覺得大家一齊嘅啫。

344
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:17,660
同一條船，我哋點樣維護香港呢個法治，同時將呢個普通法嘅原則。其實，如果我哋做得好，我哋可以影響內地啦，影響我哋周邊一啲即係司法管轄區嘅。即係大家一齊諗下，而同時又可以令到大律師嗰個行業佢嗰個發展嘅空間咧，我覺得係大一啲。

345
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:15,900
好。

346
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:00,930
嗯哼。

347
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,200
very rapidly.

348
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,090
and that's happening through.

349
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,900
Thank you. Any more?

350
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,640
係好，請。

351
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,480
The greater use of technology.

352
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,320
有邊一位可以舉手嘅？

353
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,990
maybe we're not all aware of how quickly that's happening.

354
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,740
artificial intelligence, these are real things that happening. It's going to make

355
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:59,860
The young lawyers entering profession have very different career options, and it could now be career options which go beyond simply law firms or barristers.

356
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:35,650
First of all, how good it is we have students here today, because that's the future. Yeah, David Tully, right? Yes, from City U. Yeah, please. And it's their future we're talking about. I think the other point I would make is that we must understand that the profession is changing.

357
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:40,010
啊，我覺得主要是從兩個方面考慮的。第一個就是説，從當事人角度，因為雖然這個制度它非常好，就是説大律師可能不能直接接觸這個當事人，要通過事務律師，但是你也可以看到，它大量的增加了當事人的費用。

358
01:26:55,010 --> 01:27:12,110
嘢應該要簡化。多謝好啊。咁跟住咧，我哋時間係畀團體啊。頭先可能有啲問題，每每各大法學院會想補充啊，或者係幾位同學同埋啊顧教授會唔會有嘢補充咧？先踢嘅代表啊，請。

359
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:22,900
誒，顧教授係，請。啊，我我我我覺得這個國副主席就剛才這個討論對合並的問題是一個open question，我也沒有結論。我為什麼會提出這樣一個看法呢？因為這個我也觀察了二十多年的這個大律師和事務律師之間的這樣一個距離。

360
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:54,290
噉，我認為咧，真係唔好侷限。我覺得係跨專業同埋跨司法管轄區嗰個角度去發展我哋，無論大律師或者律師嘅行業點樣去切入面，而令佢哋其實我哋好有優勢，因為普通法咧係受歡迎嘅。噉，我覺得呢一方面咧，真係法學與。

361
01:23:54,290 --> 01:24:14,300
個方面同埋，我諗誒法律政策啦，即係喺政府嗰方面要幫手推動嘅。噉我諗我畀咗呢個意見，不過有仲有何君瑤議員喎，係嘛？噉我哋畀何君瑤議員問埋第二輪咧，我哋就搶各個團體回應，同埋誒政府如果想嘅都可以簡單回應，因為政府頭先有回應嘅機會比較多嘅。我哋希望團體。

362
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:34,310
睇，如果佢哋想有誒最後嘅回應噉，首先係啊何君瑤議員都係畀翻三分鐘，噉我哋就完完咗，委員可以問㗎啦嚇。誒多謝主席誒，多謝你剛才澄清噉啊，我就交多兩點㗎啫。聽聽到大家嘅意見之後，喺誒我哋嘅嗰個案件方面嚟講咧誒。

363
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:58,850
我哋建議話攞咗呢個East Wing嗰邊咧，就愛嚟做啊個依個West Wing嗰度咧嚟做做嗰啲誒誒arbitration啊。噉，我認為嗰個地方都係始終係不足夠。最好咧係河套嘅地方裏邊咧，而家我哋有成一百二十公頃嘅土地喺嗰度。

364
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:18,860
既然我哋係要做呢一個arbitration同埋mediation咧，係我哋嘅其中而家嘅主打咧，硬件一定要有嘅。咁嗰度要整翻間即係個大樓喺度噉啊，我我覺得會係好咯。誒，睇到前海咧，就佢哋好進取嘅，佢哋希望可以用唔係淨係內地嘅司法。

365
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:38,870
系統嘅法律噉啊，直情佢就吸納咗香港嘅common law嘅experience。噉啊，然後就喺內地裏邊前海就做佢起咗一間乜嘢咧，叫做前海嘅司法大樓啊。佢唔係叫法院，司法大樓。噉你到期時用嘅法律咧，就係誒多國多元化。

366
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:58,880
第二咧就喺我哋自己律師同埋大律師之間咧，誒，我哋內部好大問題。就算你話要要有個誒鼓勵多啲人去有有呢個high high rise of audience，咁但係咧就而家嚟講嗰個solicitor advocates呢一個accreditation咧，我都唔睇得到。

367
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:18,890
佢係好好積極個誒效果唔係好理想，而家先得一百幾廿個係solicitor嘅qualification嘅，有乜咁難啫？噉我哋就覺得咧，自己香港咧大門開咗之後，小門都唔開，就於是乎咧就喺律師裏邊咧就要轉成為誒誒counsel咧，噉就諸多。

368
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:55,010
好過即係而家，我哋普通即即係newly and newly call嘅巴都係根本冇經驗嘅，都半年嘅，你都一樣畀佢做嘅。咁點解對嗰十幾年經驗嘅律師轉轉製成為solicitors裏邊，你咁大雨雨即係雨淋大滴噉樣咧？呢個應該要隔除佢好多。

369
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,620
第二個。

370
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:40,640
同學。

371
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:52,570
誒各大法學院誒，可能真係要諗會唔會再多啲係誒跨司法管轄區嘅一啲誒教授或者學科能夠開。

372
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:38,590
但是可不可以在這個剛剛才那個何議員講的，能不能做減法？譬如説增加點共同性，或者這個中間的這個隔合能不能去除多一點？這樣的話呢，你雙方都有競爭力。所以我是從這個角度來考慮。好，同學。

373
01:28:41,900 --> 01:29:01,910
第二個你可以看到，就是説年輕的大律師，他因為這樣一個限制，他不能直接去接案子的話，他要等事務律師來推薦，referral，所以他實際上是也是受到了這個機會的這個啊，這個就限制。那麼第二個你可以看，如果説這個兩地的合作的話，你。

374
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:21,920
你也可以看到大律師和事務律師之間的限制，因為雖然內地説你可以進來做顧問，但你你你你的專長沒有得到發揮嘛，因為你不能出庭的嘛。所以我覺得就是説，這個只是一個open question for further discussion，就是説你有沒有考慮，就是兩者之間，你譬如説你可以説保持兩者的分。

375
01:29:40,920 --> 01:30:00,930
會唔會想有有冇補充？Any from the students啊，professors？Any more？冇啊。我我知啊。我首先咧就係畀啊啊專員，仲有冇嘢補充？誒，冇特別補充啦。唔該。O K，噉啊，副主席想講一分鐘，我我我畀副主席。

376
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:20,940
多謝多謝主席係噉。其實顧教授，你嗰個提出咧，其實係有你嘅道理嘅。某啲案件咧，我哋見到確實，如果有律師有大律師咧，係係嘥咗錢嘅，因為其實有啲案件係一個大律師或一個律師係可以處理曬呢個。所以點解我頭先同阿彭資深大律師提出咧，就係其實喺某啲譬如。

377
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:40,950
誒呢一個區域法院嘅案件，一啲比較細型嘅案件咧，其實往往一個律師或者一個大律師咧已經係處理到㗎啦。咁所以喺呢呢一方面，大家都要考慮下係咪嗰啲案件係你係畀大律師直接去接嗰個誒客人嘅案件咧？Direct access咧呢個就要考慮啦。但係咧有啲大型嘅案件咧，確實咧。

378
01:30:40,950 --> 01:31:00,960
咧，你有大資深大律師或者律師咧，佢哋往往嗰個嘅每小時收費係平過誒呢一個誒誒呢一個事務律師嘅，但係佢哋做到嘅嘢咧就係好誒好精，同埋佢哋係誠去做，所以佢哋其實收費係平咗嘅。咁所以你真係睇案件就先係可以斷定係唔係一個合併。

379
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:20,970
嘅啊啊法律界咧係會有競爭力。好，咁咧今日咧我哋就好多謝咁多團體啊出席啊，我相信即使冇發言嘅一啲團體代表咧，係啊佢哋都係好關心呢個嘅議題。誒，我哋今次其實咧，我哋睇翻過往咧，其實。

380
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:40,980
未試過啊！喺起碼我入咗立法會之後咧，就住全球化呢個法律行業咧，係進行過比較詳細嘅討論。今日已經算係撥多咗時間，但係我希望呢個係第一次，亦都咧重新咧。我認為咧要參與討論嘅咧，就係誒政府嘅法律政策。

381
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:22,350
多謝主席。

382
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,270
今日咧就完結今日嘅議題啦，係多謝。

383
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:10,350
咁誒，我哋而家先請政府嘅代表誒簡介文件。

384
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:18,040
亦都請誒大律師公會嘅代表同埋律師會嘅代表就住議題發表意見嘅。

385
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:24,200
好噉就誒，請各位代表可以離開誒議事廳。Thank you very much for your time.

386
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:33,800
嚇，政府咧係分別咧喺二零一一年、一六年同埋一七年咧都嚟過呢個事務委員會啦，向委員講解關於香港同埋內地訂立。

387
01:33:48,460 --> 01:34:03,870
九足十七-hyphen十八括弧零四，同埋C B括弧四六一九足十七-hyphen十八括弧五嘅咁咧就誒，如果有興趣發言嘅委員咧，亦都可以按鈕㗎啦。

388
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:30,870
會希望喺今年嘅稍後咧，就會去進行誒連同一個草案嘅文本咧，就展開公開嘅諮詢。噉就誒並且希望爭取喺今年之內咧，就會向立法會提交個條例草案嘅。

389
01:31:52,950 --> 01:32:12,960
誒兩大律師行業咧，我希望將來嗰個溝通多少少用互利嘅角度啫。我覺得咧唔需要有一個侷限話，我哋而家就諗緊合併或者唔合，即係太敏感又即刻可能大家都起降，其實冇需要反為咧會唔會大家都褪一褪咧，就睇下其實點樣可以令到大家。

390
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:32,970
都可以咧喺現時呢一個國際嘅誒挑戰底下咧，我哋係增加我哋嘅吸引力同埋競爭力。而我覺得香港嘅，尤其是入得法律嘅法律界人才係優秀嘅人才嚟㗎，絕對係可以有好好嘅競爭力嘅。呢個咧誒，我我覺得我哋係應該更加發揮嘅。

391
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:53,150
咁咧就誒，最後其實就係今日好開心啦。三大法學院嘅同學代表嚟咗，咁希望咧，我哋覺得你哋會叻過我哋㗎嚇。第二日嗰啲科技啊，究竟係點樣樣啊？誒，我哋可能有一啲影響現時係會大過你哋嘅嚇。噉你可能有啲嘢係可以話翻畀我哋聽喺立。

392
01:32:53,150 --> 01:33:13,160
法啊，或者其他將來，你哋其實睇到呢個世代嗰個改變究竟係點咧？而我哋法律亦都可以追上嚟。噉，我覺得咧呢一方面咧係真係大家都係遲訓者。咁喺呢一度咧，我就好多謝大家。希望咧日後我哋再有機會討論呢個議題。誒，多謝大家出席嘅，多謝。噉我哋今。

393
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:48,460
好，跟住落嚟咧，就係誒，我哋係要繼續下一個議題啦。下一個議題咧，就係內地婚姻家庭案件判決交互認可和強制執行條例草案。咁相關嘅文件咧，係C B括弧四六一。

394
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:54,090
雙兩個兩地法院相互認可及執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決安排嘅建議嘅，咁亦都獲得誒委員誒喺香港律師會同埋香港大律師會嘅代表嘅支持嘅，我哋簽定安排嘅。噉我哋喺去年六月咧就。

395
01:34:54,090 --> 01:35:14,100
簽訂咗相關嘅安排啦。噉我哋亦都有提供向政府提誒向事務委員會咧提供相關嘅資料文件嘅。咁喺現階段咧，政府咧，我哋就喺度誒草擬緊實施安排嘅本地法例啦。咁基本上，我哋採取嗰個誒approach咧，我哋。

396
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:34,110
嗰個手法咧，就係誒，我哋去參考咗第香港法例第三一九章同埋第五九七章嘅機制啦。咁即係外地判決交互強制執行條例同埋內地判決交互強制執行條例嘅兩條嘅誒相關嘅機制去誒去。

397
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:54,120
進行我哋嗰個草擬工作嘅噉，但係由於婚姻家庭民事案件咧有佢嘅獨特性咧，咁所以我哋需要作出調整嘅。噉我哋喺較早前咧，亦都誒初步咧咁聽取咗香港律師會、香港大律師公會同埋香港家庭協會啲主要嘅持份者對於。

398
01:35:54,120 --> 01:36:14,130
我哋嗰個條例草案嘅一啲重點嘅建議嘅內容咧嘅一啲初步意見嘅噉，我哋亦都希望今次咧就喺誒藉住呢一個會議咧，可以聽取各位委員嘅一啲意見啦。噉樣噉，我哋嗰個下一步計劃咧，就係希望可以誒收到有關嘅意見之後咧，我哋就會。

399
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:51,690
咁誒，主席，我哋嗰個條例草案嘅重點內容咧，噉就誒，由於嗰個誒文件咧係關於誒認可同埋執行婚姻家庭民事案件嘅判決啦，咁所以個內容咧係相對比較技術性，係咪同埋係多啲程序性法院程序方面。

400
01:36:51,690 --> 01:37:11,700
嘅誒內容㗎咁整具體嘅內容咧，其實我哋嗰個誒提交畀立法會嘅文件咧，亦都有講述。噉我就唔會逐一再重複㗎啦。咁呢度有幾點，我係想誒同委員大概提提出一下嘅啫。咁第一樣咧就係誒，我哋咧就建議咧由。

401
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:32,980
未成年子女嘅最佳利益，即係best interest of the children。

402
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:19,250
而家咧，我哋想請香港大律師公會嘅代表陳兆基大律師，請。

403
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:17,720
進行一個噉樣嘅登記嘅申請，咁咧就誒相關嘅持份者就認為噉樣可能有助到有關方咧就去鼓勵佢哋去執行嗰個判決嘅，即係去履行個判決嘅噉樣。

404
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:31,770
噉我哋咧就而家我哋會考慮誒嗰個有關嘅意見嘅可取之處啦。咁但係同時我哋亦都需要考慮嗰個意見咧，實質上帶嚟嗰個影響啦，就係喺程序方面啊等等噉樣。

405
01:38:48,490 --> 01:39:03,930
可以喺有判決之後咧，就任何時候咧，都應該可以畀到個當事人去登記個判決嘅。咁認為咧，就唔需要一定係等到咧係出現咗個判決啦，係有不履行嘅情況咧，先至去誒。

406
01:39:51,550 --> 01:40:08,000
咁咧就當中，我提出咧就係喺我哋內地嗰個判決咧，如果係明顯噉樣違反香港嘅法律基本原則或者香港嘅公共政策咧，咁咧就係可以我哋可法院係可以唔認可或者執行嘅。

407
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:29,040
有關嘅申請嘅法院嘅申請啦，就可以向我哋香港嘅區域區域法院嗰度有專屬管核權去處理啲申請嘅。咁誒區域法院其實而家已經係做緊誒好多關於家庭民事嘅誒案件㗎啦，噉樣。

408
01:37:49,610 --> 01:38:07,570
就登記完之後咧，就等待誒有關方去誒提出咧，去將嗰個登記作廢噉樣嘅一啲噉樣嘅申請。噉係即係呢啲係處理有啲可能出現到喺登記嘅階段咧，已經明顯係唔符合登記條件嘅情況嘅噉樣。

409
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:12,640
地嘅離婚嘅情況咧，多數佢係採用呢一個去誒，由相關嘅民政部門啦去攞申請攞個離婚證，就唔一定係去佢內地個法院嘅噉樣。噉我喺度暫時誒介紹完畢噉樣。好多謝啊！

410
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:51,270
咁咧就誒，亦都另一點咧提出，即係我哋嗰個誒登記作廢嘅理由，作廢即係誒set aside啦，或者係登記撤銷嘅理由啦。噉我哋主要咧就係按住我哋安排嗰個規定啦。咁亦都係同誒第五九七章咧係誒有啲參考嘅噉樣。

411
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:49,430
咁第二咧係就住登記嘅程序咧，就登記內地嘅判決方面咧。噉我哋咧就誒去誒建議咧，就而家喺現階段喺登記內地判決嘅階段咧，就畀香港法院一啲酌情權咧，就拒絕登記嘅噉，而唔需要話一定係等到咧。

412
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:28,480
咁第三咧就就於就呢個內地判決咧幾時咧可以申請去喺我哋香港法院嗰度登記咧？咁一般嘅現時嘅誒相互認可同埋執行嘅處理嗰個手法咧，就係當出現咗冇履行嘅判決嘅時候，咁需要執行個判決咧。

413
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:48,490
就會誒有關方咧就會去向我哋法院去申請登登記同埋執行判決嘅。噉我哋喺誒頭先講過，同啲主要持份者喺度誒作初步嘅溝通嘅時候咧，就誒我哋知道有啲主要持份者亦都提出一個另一個做法，噉就係喺誒。

414
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:06,940
係李李小姐，係邊位？

415
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,140
係，多謝主席。聽落就係兩個誒。

416
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:24,550
佢哋有關呢方面嘅啊事議㗎，噉我哋亦都畀咗好多意見畀政府，亦都見到有好多意見方面，佢都喺度反映出嚟。

417
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:07,880
嚇好多謝啊何律師嚇，咁跟住誒，如果冇其他補充意見，我哋就委員發問啦嚇。噉啊，首先係啊郭榮亨議員先五分鐘。

418
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:56,580
出一個依個誒，即係誒依個一一份文件就可以做得到嘅司法解釋嚇，就可以做得到嘅。噉我哋香港希望都能夠比較上誒迅速啲去處理依件事啫。

419
01:43:51,440 --> 01:44:04,270
而家唔做㗎啦，而家係放棄咗定係點？我知道即係可能有關同事未必喺度，但係即係呢個可唔可以畀一畀少資料我哋啊？即係關於個共同撫養嘅，你知我講邊個法例呵？即係個共同撫養。

420
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:54,410
係好喜歡啦，就就見到好開心啦，見到誒好多我哋提出嘅論點都係被考慮嘅過程當中啦。咁如果有啲咩可以幫到手嘅，我哋會繼續去誒幫手，亦都會當然係好誒誒好熱烈咁參與個諮詢過程㗎啦。

421
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:28,470
噉就此咧，噉我又講想講出咧，就係如果個判決咧係涉及未成年子女嘅話咧，咁喺審查決定係唔係去認可或者執行嘅時候咧，噉就誒亦都會充法院應該充分咁去考慮咧未成年。

422
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:53,960
咁而誒最後我一點咧就提出啦。噉我哋誒個內容咧亦都會係誒會包括一啲即係其他可以認可嘅命令啦。咁當中咧亦都會係包括咧就係認可內地嘅民政部門發出嘅離婚證嘅。噉我哋嘅理解咧就係而家內。

423
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:39,730
係多謝，誒，其實我哋喺去年到而家咧都有不斷同誒律政署政府嗰方面咧去直誒去繼續溝通嘅。其實呢喺而家呢度第四份呢份即係number four嗰份誒誒誒paper裏邊咧，其實都已經有好多我哋誒所提出嘅論點嘅嘅論點喺度㗎啦。噉我哋都

424
01:41:54,970 --> 01:42:14,980
好誒，咁跟住係啊，律師會嘅代表何志權律師請。誒，多謝誒主席，我亦都係啊，同呢個陳大啊律師所講嘅嘢一致啦。就係過往幾年，我哋都係有機會參與啊，畀個律政。

425
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:44,840
噉就係誒，唯獨我希望咧誒喺誒跟住嚟嘅咧，就希望能夠律政司嗰方面盡快將呢個誒條例咧可以盡快帶到嚟立法局去變成法例，因為係啊喺內地嚟講咧，佢哋係可以好快最變成法例，因為佢哋只係只係需要。

426
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:31,430
啊！律師會咧都係冇呢一個意見啦，亦都係好支持呢一個嘅啊啊動作係去咁做嘅。咁誒呢個建議其實誒都應該經過幾轉呢一個司法事務委員會啦。咁所以我哋亦都係同阿何律師一樣啦，就係希望啊呢一個有關建議啦係盡快落實，將。

427
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:51,440
嗰個誒嘅條例草案咧，係盡快擺上立法會嗰度，令到佢係盡快實施啦。咁誒，亦都同時間我哋知道同婚姻誒改革誒有關嘅，即係婚姻誒訴訟改革有關嘅，都有幾條條例啦。誒，有一個就係勞福局嗰個兒童條例啦。咁其實嗰個係咪？

428
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:27,990
好，郭議員係誒。據我所知咧，就係誒，暫時係誒呢個階段咧，就唔拎上去，唔提出去立法會先嚇。即係農福局決定就係就係誒，先咧就係將嗰啲誒support measure嗰啲誒誒再做好啲嚇，即係嗰啲即係支持嘅措施。講緊maintenance support，maintenance support。

429
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:48,000
誒嗰個maintainance part，我知道咧就係誒誒呢個誒H A B咧，就係會做一個誒顧問研究，就一個顧問研究咧，就係會喺依今年二零一八年嘅上半年咧，就希望可以展開呢個開展呢個呢個誒呢個顧問研究。噉我知道咧，佢哋係而家係準備緊。

430
01:44:48,170 --> 01:45:08,180
係誒揾呢個顧問嚟去去委託佢哋去做呢個，即係佢哋揾緊顧問去睇啊，做面診服務啦。咁個範圍好大嘅嚇。呢個可能又需要啲時間啦。咁contact centre嗰度咧，佢會唔會contact centre？我據我所知就好似已經係運作緊㗎啦，係。我知道，但係而家想改善嗰嗰樣嘢啊嘛。誒。

431
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:28,190
呢個可能係其中一個啲誒改善嘅啲support measure之一嚟嘅，咁其實仲有好多support measure。即係佢哋而家即係講清楚，就係佢哋而家會做曬依係列嘅support measure，跟住再拎條議題。係啦，再再係啦，係啦，係啦，嚇！即係我我我理解就噉樣啦。你想你想問邊個？去律師會定係大？

432
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:48,200
何律師好，郭議員，以我所瞭解嘅情況嚟講，因為我有機會都同誒呢個啊陸局長啊傾過呢個問題嘅，噉就係我所瞭解到咧，佢哋係希望做多啲關於呢個誒，即係誒支持嘅服務啦。噉就包括咧，就現在有一個其中一個誒。

433
01:45:48,200 --> 01:46:08,210
即係探視嗰個中心咧，就改為五個中心嘅。咁五個中心咧嘅服務咧係包含嘅服務係多啲㗎，就係包括呢個係父母嘅誒，即係誒誒雙方父母嘅誒點樣去誒照顧小朋友啊，同埋呢個誒協調員。

434
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:28,220
嗰個服務啊，各方面嘢都有嘅。噉就係誒，佢哋會根據之前嘅施政報告提出嚟咧，會有五千六百萬。如果係立法會係通過嘅話，就係批做呢五個centre嘅嘅嘢噉。噉就至於嗰個誒呢個兒童嗰個。

435
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:48,230
個誒即係程序嗰個誒草案咧，以我所瞭解到咧，佢哋希望能夠喺二零一九年度咁誒初嗰段時間會再提出嚟。如果係有機會喺二零二零年咧，希望能夠見到係立法嘅。換句話講，我所得嘅信息咧就係。

436
01:46:48,230 --> 01:47:08,240
佢哋唔係各自嗰個啊草案，而係只不過咧就想做多少少嘢，係去誒，即係誒，去協助各方邊嘅所需嘅服務啦。包括有一啲即係對依個條例嘅草案嘅反對嘅人士咧，希望佢多啲了。

437
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:28,250
解呢個草案，然後係通過嘅，再攞出嚟嘅。好，呢個係我最後所知道嘅瞭解。有冇問題？我都係咯，我都理解係噉樣啦。噉就誒，希望局方要明白就係實在，我哋都法律界係好想嗰個兒童條例咧，係都係盡快通過嘅。咁所以誒，亦都即係希望你將呢一個聲音帶翻翻。

438
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:48,260
去啊！局方好啊，因為咧，而家我哋剩翻三分鐘啦。我哋唔一定要再用曬十五分鐘嘅，不過咧，我就誒喺呢度都宣佈我誒都行使我嘅酌情權咧，就係延長十五分鐘，咁畀誒有興趣嘅啊委員咧，佢可以問問題同埋你哋作誒大。

439
01:47:48,260 --> 01:48:08,270
加作補充嘅噉，跟住落嚟就係誒我嘅問題啦。首先，我想請啊李專員咧，即係都誒講多次咧。其實誒喺你哋嗰個過往裏邊咧，即係明顯不符合登記條件嘅，通常係包括邊幾類啦？因為我哋其實今日傾嘅咧都係公眾嗰個，都係誒一度大。

440
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:30,040
咁第二咧，當然我自己就一直都係好支持，即係而家呢一個嘅誒方向啦嚇，就係啊內地嘅婚姻家庭嘅判決咧，就可以有互相會認可同埋強制執行嘅。噉我亦都好明白何律師所講啦，即係誒對於內地嚟講，佢最高人民法院咧，佢有一個。

441
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:50,050
司法解釋佢認可咗呢一樣嘢，我哋就要誒經過嚇立法會嘅咁咧。我就想問一問咧，其實相關喺現時即係話平衡去跟進嘅時候，我係主要誒問下政府嘅咁咧就誒，其實喺一啲決定誒，譬如一啲判決去執行嘅時候咧。

442
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,750
大家都係喺度關心緊嘅。

443
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,340
嘅誒。

444
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:50,160
誒都希望真係真係。

445
01:50:50,270 --> 01:51:05,830
到佢根本就唔係我哋嗰個安排，或者我哋將來嗰個條例草案入邊所可以執行嘅一啲類型嘅判決噉樣，咁咁嗰啲就或者係唔需要先登記，然之後又等人去反對噉樣啦嚇。

446
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:24,490
噉就係呢啲係應該係覺得應該係幾明顯嘅一啲例子噉樣啦嚇。咁至於誒你講話誒頭先講話嗰個同內地嗰度相互誒執行嘅時候咧，有冇一啲配套嘅跟進噉樣啦？咁其實我哋喺誒去

447
01:48:50,210 --> 01:49:10,220
誒係咪你哋而家頭先剛才講嗰啲，譬如contact centre咧，係可以解決到一啲問題。誒，譬如啦，我自己處理過嘅就係即係雙胞胎啊，兩個孖生噉啊，父母都冇問題㗎。噉佢佢一人一個啦，可唔可以一人一個咧？噉樣即係佢又唔係話大家有咩錯誤啊噉樣。

448
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:30,230
噉你畀曬一方咧又唔得，咁咧但係個探視權咧就確唔確保咧？如果佢跟曬一邊嘅時候咧，有時探視權都有都困難嘅，因為始終係兩地。咁呢啲係咪有詳細咧？即係都處理過嗰個跟進嘅嘅工作，可以協助即係誒父母雙方當事人。

449
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:50,240
甚至一啲可能係係誒，即係法庭一邊係判咗誒誒，佢一對嘅子女都係畀即係另外一方嘅時候，噉係咪誒社工？譬如我哋香港興啊，用社工嗰個報告，噉我哋嘅社工啊，我哋嘅嗰啲嘅即係相關嘅專業嘅意見係咪可以係？

450
01:49:50,240 --> 01:50:10,250
獲充分嘅考慮咧，當你話係best interest，即係話係以嗰個細路仔最佳利益嘅時候，即係我係比較關心嘅就係，當我哋一旦付諸實踐嘅時候，呢啲配套嘅工作係咪而家都考慮得非常細緻嘅咧？嚇，想阿李專員。

451
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:30,260
誒或者其他幾位補充一下嚇，係啊，主席或者我誒去答翻你嗰誒兩個問題噉，同埋之前有啲唔同嘅誒各方啦，啊委員或者係誒我哋嗰啲judgements都有提出話嗰時間嗰方面啦。咁誒明顯不符合嗰個登記咧，其實係我哋。

452
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:50,270
誒一種係一個誒一般性嘅，即係諗誒當我哋去考慮嘅時候咧，就係我哋唔係一定話有特定嘅，因為過往出現咗咩啲問題噉，所以想去咁做，只不覺得好似程序方面咧噉樣有個噉樣嘅彈性咧，係比較合理。咁即係可能係話佢有啲明顯不符合，例如一開始已經見。

453
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:45,480
傾呢個安排嘅時候咧，就中間我亦都有去誒同啲誒相關嗰啲政府部門咧作出一啲徵詢嘅。咁喺我哋做調嚟緊做條例草案嘅時候咧，我哋將來亦都會有個公開諮詢。咁同埋咧，亦都會誒再同政府有關嘅部門咧，即係聽聽。

454
01:51:45,480 --> 01:52:05,490
睇佢有咩意見噉，所以喺實質上咧，即係將來如果喺誒點樣去旅行嘅時候咧，有啲乜嘢需要配套咧？咁呢度咧，可能咧就係嗰個階段咧，我哋會再去處理。因為現階段我哋都仲係誒講緊一個大體嗰個方向噉，但係誒我都誒講一講，因為我哋嘅嗰個構思咧就係即係如果。

455
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:25,500
我係獲得登記可以去執行嗰啲法例，其實佢咧就基本上咧，佢就好似等於一個區域法院，我哋香港區域法院發出嘅一個相類似嘅一個判決噉樣㗎啦。咁所以，如果係我哋香港法院下低執行嘅情況底下咧，佢可以有一啲係做到嘅。

456
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:48,030
程序啊，或者係一啲誒科税都可以去做嚇，可以執行咁咧。就至於時間嗰方面咧，即係我誒充分聽到誒各位咧都想我哋去盡快去進行呢一個工作嘅。咁其實誒大家都可以安心。其實我哋律師咧亦都會係盡力咧，盡努力咧去盡快噉樣去。

457
01:52:48,030 --> 01:53:08,040
進行呢一個立法嘅工作，就立法草案嘅工作啦。咁但係我亦都要需需要誒指出，較早前咧就亦都多謝啲持份者畀一啲意見，我哋噉我哋都要需要考慮噉，同埋我哋都需要同啲相關嘅誒部門啊或者機構咧去誒，包括法院啦，我哋香港法院啦，去做一啲徵詢。

458
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:28,050
噉，噉我哋而家現階段咧，希望咧，即係可以爭取到咧，大概噉樣暑假大概八月度啦，咁可以做咗個徵詢，咁當然公眾公開嘅諮詢，咁但係當然諮詢亦都即係需要一個誒，大概例如四個禮拜起碼噉樣，係等到有關嘅人士可以去做出畀一。

459
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,620
好，誒，李專員。

460
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:23,200
當離婚之後咧，譬如哺乳期咧，啲細路咧就一定畀媽媽先。

461
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:42,020
誒，跟住落嚟就係啊，張超雄議員。

462
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:44,120
好，張女士係咪？係係，多謝主席。誒，一般而言，如果係關於呢啲民商事嘅一啲誒。

463
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:36,500
第一誒派發傳票係容易啲處理，唔需要好似一啲而家做法咁要誒攞國內專家意見啊，然後搞一輪之後咧都翻都搞唔到派唔到票。嗯哼，嗯。

464
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:43,270
點樣提起個訴訟開始先咧？做咗呢一步，方便兩邊嘅嘅申請者咧，係避免咗全中國走去揾人啊，或者係喺香港都好難揾嘅咁情況之下，有冇咩你諗法點樣做法咧？唔該。

465
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:35,870
翻譯本咁需唔需要公證呢個翻譯本咧？誒喺我哋一個安排入邊係冇公證呢一樣，即係唔需要公證呢一樣嘢嘅。誒即係某幾一個特定情況下咧，先出示一個公證誒公證書嘅啫。OK，唔該住。好。

466
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:58,040
係，多謝主席。誒，呢一個內地婚姻嘅一啲判決互認同埋強制執行咧，個方向係基本上係好嘅。噉我哋亦都知好多跨境嘅婚姻啦。咁呢度。

467
01:57:43,930 --> 01:58:01,880
啊，另外仲有一個關於誒呢一個誒中文譯本嘅，咁如果我哋個法院誒已經提出咗一個中文譯本嘅一個判決書咧，就可以攞呢一個判決書去誒內地度做呢個登記嘅，咁亦都就唔需要一個公證嘅。

468
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:24,270
傳信嘅方式嘅，咁所以即係你講嗰個內地嗰個法院咧，佢哋點樣去做咧，就似乎佢哋都可以去用到，即係唔話係咪一定要周圍揾人咧？如果你唔知道個人喺內地，但係又喺邊度嘅噉樣，咁至於嗰個香港咧，譬如香港有冇咩機制可以係令到嗰個傳遞？

469
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:43,650
一個變質噉樣樣去送啲傳票或者或者呢啲判決。對唔住，打斷咗你。係誒，意思係香港嘅婚姻嘅訴訟都可以利用內地嘅公告形式去當一個發票嘅派派發傳票。係我哋而家探同誒最高人民法院探討緊呢一個可能性。OK，好，謝議員。另外一個咧，關於嗰個。

470
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:48,060
啲意見啦，噉樣噉，但係我哋整體都係希望喺今年之內咧，可以再翻翻去立法會提交草案噉樣。好多謝李專員嚇誒，跟住落嚟咧就係啊謝偉俊議員。各位主持，係誒，當然係好事多磨啦，即係最先係二零一一年開始，我哋首先有接觸呢個課題啦，噉。

471
01:53:50,440 --> 01:54:10,450
話做就做啦，唔好再等多幾年啦。咁誒，反而我想了解下幾樣嘢，一就係嗰個，嗱，如果係內香，誒，對唔住，內地嘅判決喺香港執行咧，咁語言上都係冇問題啦。咁香港嘅判決喺內地咧，可能我相信都可能要翻譯嘅，或者係有需要問題。我想了解下，除咗啲翻譯問題之外咧，我哋第三段講起。

472
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:30,460
話：如果香港嘅法院係一個所謂誒確認咗certified copy個judgement咧，就可以直接去用噉。我想你而家呢個同呢個中國公證嗰個需要性，我可能我未完全掌握曬你哋個安排，但係有冇需要再進一步呢個公證嘅過程咧？假如個特別個文個文件本身唔係一個誒中文嘅文件，又可能選。

473
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:50,470
就用英文嘅一個訴訟啦。第二個問題，我想了解下就係誒，其中有一個係原因係可以將一個或者唔承認咧，或者set aside一個誒內地嘅嘅判決咧，就係話喺誒十五條四嗰度咧講話，如果個所謂唔係恰當地去派發嘅傳票，即係not proper summons咧。咁所以你而家呢個，因為呢個都係香。

474
01:54:50,470 --> 01:55:10,480
香港好多時訴訟嘅困擾就係喺誒派發傳票或者通知對方要申請誒誒有婚姻訴訟嘅問題。以往咧就誒法庭相對我理解相對係寬鬆去處理呢個作為誒派票嘅問題，即係發告票傳遞嘅問題。但係近依一兩年咧，似乎就...

475
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:30,490
有啲啊，法庭咧就覺得係需要好穩重地咧，係需要內地嘅法律專家畀個意見之後咧，佢先肯接受呢個所謂sub service即係代替性嘅substitute service噉樣啦。噉我想了解下呢個誒喺呢個運作過程上，你哋有冇咩特別嘅諗法或者安排？點樣可以處理呢個誒或者係都唔好講話承認個判決啦，又最先。

476
01:55:45,900 --> 01:56:05,910
或或者我誒嘗試簡單咁答一答啊謝議員第二條問題啊噉啊或者我睇睇我啲同事有冇補充啊咁誒據我瞭解咧就係其實誒我亦都向內地嘅法院都徵詢過。據我哋瞭解咧，其實佢哋都有一個即係用誒公開嘅傳信嘅一個方式嘅，即係登公告。

477
01:56:44,400 --> 01:57:04,410
誒嘅案件嘅話，都雙方都係通過兩家嘅法院咧去幫助誒你哋誒去派票啊，或者派嗰個誒判決嘅。咁當然啦，我哋都收到業界嘅有一啲查詢，就係話當嗰個誒，譬如嘅被傳召人佢喺國內，但係又揾唔到佢個最終地址。

478
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:24,420
你出現咗一個誒揾唔到佢嘅情況之下，咁誒可以做點樣做法咧？咁噉，我哋而家都同誒最高人民法院咧就探討下，可唔可以用呢一個公告嘅形式去揾呢一個已經揾唔到嘅一個誒被傳傳召人？咁希望用呢一個公告形式，亦都可以便利到誒雙方可以誒。

479
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,230
我第三點咧，就係。

480
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,890
咁呢啲嘅情況咧，就同香港個考慮唔同。

481
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:47,200
咁個撫養權咧就會歸個經濟狀況好嗰個。

482
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:58,650
咁即係有冇呢個空間咧？咁即係如果我哋好清楚睇到嗰個。

483
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:42,250
亦都會睇嗰個誒邊個有錢啲啦，或者即係經濟狀況會好啲。

484
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:07,390
案情係同個判決係可能有誒矛盾嘅，甚至即係引發到兄弟姊妹分離嘅。

485
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:53,410
容許咧，中港兩地嘅法院喺一啲特定嘅情況底下咧，係可以拒絕承認一啲或者執行一啲嘅相關嘅判決嘅。

486
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:58,800
咁當然呢個即係我諗香港嘅法庭都可能係考慮因素之一啦，但係喺內地咧，我聽婦女講咧，佢哋呢個係一個相當決定性嘅條件。

487
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:36,590
咁暴雨期之後咧，好多時咧就如果個仔女係男嘅咧，就歸爸爸；女咧就歸媽媽。咁好多時會出現到嗰個兄弟姊妹分離。

488
02:00:42,800 --> 02:01:00,750
咁於是就香港如果係要互應又要強制執行嘅話咧，噉佢哋又擔心呢個問題就係，即係如果嗰個誒有一方係有錢啲，佢可以好快喺內地做咗，亦都另外就係內地嗰個。

489
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:20,190
即係有錢個考慮啦，或者有錢去推動嗰個判決嘅影響嘅因素，會係強過香港咧。噉佢哋就擔心，即係當冇錢嘅一方，往往亦都係婦女啦，就會係一個好不利嘅狀態啦。咁所以引申到誒。

490
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:42,520
你想辦離婚，但係佢一個喺內地辦離婚就搞個離婚證，噉佢好快嘅，咁可能佢快過香港嗰個法庭程序咧。咁內誒內地嗰個判決就成為一個即係首先做咗嘅一個判決。

491
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:22,410
即係唔需要誒呢個誒公證人去另外加一層足嘅。如果英文嘅判決書咧？誒如果有英文，如果係英文判決書嘅話咧，噉就希望睇下法院會唔會出一個誒呢一個翻譯本。如果冇嘅話，噉就要當事人去提供一個誒盡盡可能誒貼近英文原意嘅一個。

492
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:18,430
無論佢喺邊邊作出咗呢啲噉樣嘅法庭嘅判決咧，誒，我哋都希望係一貫嘅。咁不過由於兩地嗰個法制唔同啦，誒，譬如我哋都聽到好多婦女咁講咧，就係話內地嗰個婚姻規個法咧就係。

493
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:23,180
咁會唔會即係造成一啲誒困難咧？噉樣咁二來咧就係佢哋嗰個誒離婚咧，佢哋話有兩種，一種叫離婚證，一種叫離婚令。離婚證咧就好簡易快捷嘅，咁有時就會即係如果你喺香港。

494
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:42,520
誒，我哋啲NGO咧都會提，其實係咪應該誒仿效即係誒呢個海牙嗰個嘅誒有關國際追索兒童撫養費同埋其他形式家庭撫養嘅公約嗰個精神咧，就係話用。

495
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:27,700
咁唔係以兒童嘅福祉為最大依歸，咁呢啲嘅即係豁免或者係拒絕承認係咪可以出現咧？噉樣好點樣？基於文有時係文化嘅不同或者其他嘅不同，我都有興趣瞭解一下，會唔會有呢啲噉嘅例外條款啊，或者點？

496
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:12,070
但係，我哋香港嘅法院又可唔可以受理去嘗試推翻呢個判決嘅咧？

497
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:10,850
面話同當地嗰個政策係會有抵觸嘅嚇，同其他可能相比較咧，呢個係比較人民嘅嘢嚟㗎。

498
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:21,570
或者調轉，即係香港做咗一個判決，內地嘅法院又會唔會可以受理推翻香港嘅判決嘅？係，李專員。

499
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:41,780
一啲所謂嘅誒搶襲嘅情況咯，即係如果我哋香港已經展開咗嗰個相關嘅誒法律程序啦，咁跟住咧喺內地又再展開嗰個法律程序，然之後。

500
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:47,710
噉樣咧嚇，李專員多謝啊張議員嘅意見啦，即係同我哋分享誒關於即係內地嗰個誒即係離婚嗰個情況啊，或者係即係香港市民佢哋有陣時會面對嗰個問題啦，噉樣佢遇到嘅問題啦。咁誒，首先咧，我哋誒即係據我哋瞭解咧，就內地嗰個離婚證咧，其實啊～

501
02:02:47,710 --> 02:03:07,720
就係需要雙方同意先至攞到嘅，咁所以咧，如果係誒佢哋有一方咧係唔同意嘅話咧，都唔可以誒攞到嘅。咁但係另外一方面咧，就係誒頭先張議員問到有冇一啲作廢嗰個誒理由咧噉樣啦。咁其實我哋誒今次個文件都有交代，其實個安排亦都。

502
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:27,730
有噉，我哋都誒準備喺嗰個誒，打算喺嗰個條例草案嗰度都引入咗一啲誒登記作廢嘅理由啦，就係誒咁當中咧，亦都會包括一啲誒，例如佢用欺詐手段攞到嗰個有關嘅判決啊，或者有關嘅誒誒證書啊噉樣啦，咁亦都係可能會包括誒。

503
02:03:42,060 --> 02:04:02,070
攞咗個判決先嘅噉樣，咁因為我哋香港已經受理咗有關嘅案件啦，咁所以咧就呢個亦都可能係一個誒理由去拒絕去誒實現嗰個登記嘅。噉就亦都講一講，我哋都好你專業唔好意思，我停一停。誒，如果大家唔反對，誒，我都要宣佈咧，就係誒我。

504
02:04:02,070 --> 02:04:22,080
我哋都再延多十五分鐘，不過咧，我哋就唔好用曬啦，好唔好啊？儘量咧就係啊，我哋已經畫咗線，噉就一睇下與會者仲會唔會有補充。噉我畀李專員講埋佢嘅回應嚇，噉就好快啦。即係頭先我都提到，我哋其中一個誒要考慮嘅理由，就係我哋香港嗰個誒香港嘅。

505
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:42,090
嘅誒基本嘅法律政策同埋嗰個公共政策啦，誒嗰個相關嘅內地判決有冇明顯違反到呢啲噉樣嘅誒香港基本法律原則同埋誒公共嘅政策嘅？咁而當中咧，亦都要考慮到兒童嘅最佳利益噉樣去決定係咪執行嗰個相關嗰個。

506
02:04:42,090 --> 02:05:02,100
判決咁呢個係我哋嘅法院可以去做嘅。好誒，我我我明白你嘅問題嘅誒嗱，不如噉樣，因為咧誒誒，你想第二輪係咪？第二輪我畀你，我畀你兩分鐘啦。我畀你兩分鐘。係多謝主席。O K。噉樣誒，當即係譬如話內。

507
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:41,860
誒，我諗我哋其實嗰個講嘅就唔係講話佢可以直接推翻，因為其實誒內地做咗個判決或者香港法院做咗個判決，咁所以嗰個問題咧就係我哋係咪認可即係承唔承認呢一個判決，同埋會唔會執行噉樣？咁呢個我哋個安排就係。哦，不如我我補充一下，就係我記得以往我。

508
02:05:41,860 --> 02:06:01,870
我哋做呢啲民商事嘅判決互相認可咧，即係以往，譬如兩岸啦嚇噉，佢咧就會係話，如果你違反咗當地嘅公共政策或者利益，噉佢會有一個保留條款。咁當然咧，婚姻家庭呢個咧，我哋誒未必就會去到嗰個層。

509
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:31,140
咁但係，譬如李專員，你剛才提到嘅就係話誒，如果去到係只係誒違反基本法咧，噉就誒其實可能未必正視到剛才誒誒，譬如阿張議員啦，或者我剛才都有提到一啲誒情況，即係你誒孖生嘅。

510
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,980
嚟作出咗一啲嘅判決。

511
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:08,390
再去去公眾嗰度諮諮詢係。

512
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:28,750
我相信佢哋都會作出自己嘅判決之後去執行嗰一個咯。咁至於如果雙方嘅法院，

513
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:35,570
平時會作出一啲唔同嘅判決，咁呢個呢個係一個問題嚟嘅，但係呢個問題係基本上冇一個。

514
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:16,170
我相信係諮詢，即係工作係諮詢邊方面嘅嘢咧？會唔會係？李專員，請有冇咁需要？真正再諮詢咧？係。

515
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:44,480
全面或者可以做得到嘅解決咯，除咗去嘗試即係去諗會唔會有方法去唔執行或者唔認可咧咁之外。

516
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:25,780
係將佢呢啲係包括埋喺裏邊，你溝通嘅過程裏邊咧，係會有一個note係講到呢一方面噉樣樣咧，即係誒呢一方面，我覺得我都有，我都係關心嘅，我都係關心嘅嚇，李專員。

517
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:22,260
必係需要限死個法院，一定要考慮乜嘢因素噉，因為佢可能會睇得好廣闊，同埋可能隨住兒唔同嘅個案，同埋隨住嗰個兒童嗰個年齡嘅增，即係嘅嘅分別，同埋佢嗰個情況咧，咁可能會轉嘅呢個。

518
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:51,450
啊，噉啊，一人分一個，即係譬譬如係咁啦嚇。咁呢一啲誒會唔會你哋再洽商嘅時候咧？呢個我相信就同政治係無關，或者同公共政策其實呢個比較都都未必係完，即係好好需要去到嗰個層面，而係喺誒誒你所謂。

519
02:06:51,450 --> 02:07:11,460
嘅最佳利益嗰度咧，即係呢個所謂best interest嗰度咧，我覺得係可能係要考慮埋。剛才可能我就都有提嘅誒，我哋文化上啦，同埋誒誒專業啦，即係我話你譬如啲社工啊take care嗰個誒，有呢啲可以係考慮埋你個best interest咧，你可唔可以？

02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:46,070
阿梁議員，你講得誒都提出個正正確個，即係嗰個啱啱嗰個點，就係嗰個誒兒童嘅最佳利益啦。咁呢樣嘢喺我哋誒家庭啊、民事啊、兒童嗰方面嘅考慮咧，係往往我哋法院都會引用一個噉樣嘅概念。咁而我哋香港嘅法院咧，亦都係有就住唔同一個案。

521
02:07:46,070 --> 02:08:06,080
佢亦都會講過何為係兒童嘅最佳利益，咁所以其實咧，我相信咧，即係我哋既然喺嗰個誒，如果我哋嘅安排有，同埋喺個誒我哋嗰個誒將來個法例嗰度咧，有一個噉樣嘅概念咧，我相信我哋嗰個法院咧係可以去運用到嗰個適當咁去考慮，咁未。

522
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:42,570
O.K.啊，我諗誒誒，與會者仲有冇兩位誒大律師同埋律師會嘅代表？有冇補充？冇補充啦。噉我諗咧都係誒最後啦。誒誒，何律師有補充係咪？我我可以講翻咧，其實而家個誒個即係而而而而家嗰啲誒。

523
02:08:42,570 --> 02:09:02,580
點講咧？已經提出嘅論點裏邊，其實都已經有講到話有啲咩情況底下係可以去唔執行或者唔去認可誒內地法院嗰個判決。其實誒，如果係十有十八歲以下兒童咧，誒而家個諮詢文件裏邊其實都已經有講到話係會考慮埋佢嘅最佳利益著想啦。

524
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:22,590
噉你話，至於如果內地已經有判決嘅話，喺香港執行噉，如果誒認可嘅話，就就執行啦。如果唔認可嘅話咧，即係話符合咗啲條件唔認可嘅話，咁香港法院就會另外自己作出一個判決咯。噉就會係香港法院個判決去執行咯。咁倒翻轉頭，如果香港法院去到內地，佢認可嘅話就執行；，如果佢唔認可，

525
02:09:44,760 --> 02:10:04,770
好，我諗咧喺誒諮詢文件，我哋再討論嘅時候，特別畀公眾瞭解啲，其實其實畀公眾瞭解嘅過程，亦都可能係可以令到我哋，譬如就算內地相關婚姻家事法庭嘅誒誒司法界，大家都會更加明白，即係可能普通法同埋內。

526
02:10:04,770 --> 02:10:24,780
內地嘅法律喺誒最佳利益會唔會係咪真係有分歧，或者係冇分歧咧？或者大家都考慮嘅嘢係誒好近好接近噉，我覺得呢一方面咧可以再溝通多啲，同埋明確多啲。始終咧唔係人人係即係我哋就明白啦，係咪？梗係睇嗰個誒判決啦。但係普通人，

527
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:44,860
佢唔同你去睇嗰個判決㗎嘛，咁所以咧，我覺得係大家可以講明白少少，將呢啲原則，因為我哋普通法就係成日都要你要睇嗰個判決，咁但係可唔可以讓甚至我哋嘅委員大家都係理解我哋跟進呢個問題嘅時候，我哋咪更加可以清晰咯，好冇？咁咧，我諗係何律師請。

528
02:10:44,860 --> 02:11:04,870
想提出一個問題畀啊李專員嘅。頭先李專員提到話，大概喺誒過多幾個月到會再有一個諮詢文件，因為其實呢個啊議案嚟講已經過去年嘅十月都好似做完個諮詢文件嘛，而家已經誒，去到立法，即係已經簽咗個安排，噉。

529
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:55,740
咁如果冇其他議題，我哋正式結。

530
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:51,220
提出嘅問題，希望誒可以啊注意啦，同埋誒大家可以關心多少少啦。噉我係誒再一次多謝大家，多謝大律師公會同埋律師會嘅代表，同埋政府嘅代表，多謝多謝。

531
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:37,140
你你專員，第對住個麥係嘛？係主要係會諮詢個條例草案嚇嚇，即係我哋喺嗰個法例嘅時候嚇，係嗰啲誒各方面可能就係最佳利益啊呢啲，大家都都都一樣有有一個討論㗎。好噉，我諗咧就誒今日討論到此為止噉，剛才。
