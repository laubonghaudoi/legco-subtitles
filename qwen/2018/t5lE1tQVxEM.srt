1
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,260
嚟到區區議員啊，傅曉林女士發言啊，唔該，三分鐘。多謝主席。

2
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,520
唞一分鐘之後，大家可以開始嘅話咧，我就或者先請誒。

3
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:50,310
睇嚟，大家你哋喺有公眾需知裏邊咧，都講翻大家在座需要留意嘅事項咧。噉就如果而家大家，

4
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:56,220
時候咧就獲得面試嘅機會，但係當僱主見到佢嘅時候咧，知道佢係少數族裔嘅女性咧，亦都係揾藉口取消面試嘅。

5
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:05,520
而現時訴諸法律嘅門檻太高，種族歧視條例及性別歧視條例難以保障少數族裔嘅婦女。

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:42,460
係需要做嘅話，都可以之後咧係補翻畀秘書處嘅。睇嚟大家，我哋咧就誒現場嘅公眾發言咧，不受誒立法會權力嘅特權條例保護嘅。

7
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:26,850
第二，少數族裔嘅婦女咧喺日常嘅生活裏邊仍然受到歧視。調查顯示啦，大約六成受訪嘅少數族裔女嘅人士咧，仍然係難以書寫中文，導致求職困難。

8
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:12,450
比率明顯係較低嘅，從事嘅工作咧，亦都係偏向於低技術嘅工種。我早前已經要求勞工處提供更加多嘅全日嘅支援啦，協助婦女尋找合適嘅工作。

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,130
都到咗法定嘅時間，噉啊，今日嘅主題咧就係與少數族裔婦女有關嘅事宜。咁照往一樣，啊，往時一樣啦，我哋先邀請誒有關嘅團體咧作出一啲嘅誒現場嘅誒講述之後咧，我哋先請大家誒查詢。

10
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:38,420
文化同埋價值觀嘅差異啦，佢哋嘅社交網絡都係以家庭為重心，遇到問題嘅時候咧，亦都求助無門，令到好多少數族裔嘅婦女啦成為被忽略嘅一羣。所以我促請政府採取積極嘅態度，關心佢哋嘅需要。

11
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:35,420
喺呢個時候，或者請我哋誒嘅公眾人士入場啦，同時請政府代表入場。咁因為我哋有誒多位人士代表嘅，包括有誒政務司司長私人辦公室特別職務組嘅毛婉清女士啦，啊有在職家庭及學生資助事務處處長李忠善先生，社會福利處。

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:55,430
署助理署長家庭及兒童福利事宜嘅彭潔玲女士啦，僱員再培訓局副行政總監負責培訓服務嘅彭炳雄先生，勞工署高級勞工事務主任負責就業同埋政策嘅羅瑞芳女士，歡迎多位，亦都等緊我哋嘅誒公眾人士進場，我哋可以馬上開始。

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:32,760
相信好多朋友都熟習我哋嘅操作㗎啦，不過都循例再提提大家。我哋有現場嘅誒翻譯嘅服務啦。噉我哋現場版係一號嘅頻道，誒廣東話版本咧；二號就係英文版本；三號就普通話版本嘅。睇嚟大家咧就誒一陣間發言時間係三分鐘，亦都大家如果尚未提供任何書面意見。

14
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,360
啊！

15
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,860
The female E.M.R.

16
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,010
或其他信息， not easily viable due to various reasons.

17
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,160
謝謝主席，我係Anita，從DAB民族羣體服務中心。

18
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:14,850
population in the labour sports force participation rate，which is 54.5%。

19
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:45,540
因此，低工資， in general， is thought to be main reason of poverty among ethnic minorities women.

20
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:54,830
學習中文、進行宗教崇拜、支援婦女就業等等，希望可以改善少數族裔婦女嘅生活。多謝主席。唔該曬，副主席。We now invite Mr. Nita Kumari Gurung of the DAB, please.

21
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:15,510
香港 local ethnic minorities, women, especially Pakistani, Nepali age group 20 above, are not able to speak fluent Chinese, and some of them are not very good in English either.

22
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:18,280
1,000至15,000， for if they wish to join the labour force by letting their children and family under supervision of foreign domestic helper, it is not affordable affordable with their low income.

23
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:41,880
喺海麗村附近物色適當嘅場地，亦都會爭取喺東湧區裏邊增加相關嘅設施。關於以上各點，我建議政府成立多元文化事務委員會，負責統籌以上嘅工作，包括協助小數族裔。

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:21,550
誒，好多少數族裔嘅人士咧喺香港其實已經住咗幾代咁耐啦，亦都視香港為佢哋嘅屋企。喺東湧區咧有唔少少數族裔嘅人士居住，咁通過日常嘅地區工作啦，咁經常都同呢一啲少數族裔嘅婦女接觸，亦都可以感受到佢哋所面對到嘅困難。由於

25
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:58,720
首先，少數族裔嘅婦女嘅貧窮嘅問題咧，仍然好嚴重嘅。部分人士嘅教育程度同埋語文嘅程度不足，喺求職嘅時候咧，亦都得唔到適切嘅支援，好難以投入職場。正如政府嘅數字顯示啦，少數族裔嘅女性咧，特別係南亞裔嘅女性嘅勞動參與。

26
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:47,340
即使佢哋已經取得高學歷，喺香港紮根，講得一口流利嘅廣東話，但係都因為中文書寫甚至呼息嘅問題咧，都令到僱主卻步。唔少咧只能從事簡單嘅工作。有居住喺東湧嘅少數族裔嘅女性咧，試過寄求職信去嘅時。

27
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:25,970
第三，給予少數族裔嘅婦女社交活動嘅空間，進行宗教崇拜，拓寬社交圈子，對於佢哋面對日常嘅困難咧係十分之重要嘅。但係因為場地嘅不足，減少佢哋建立社區網絡嘅機會。我一直都向房署跟進，為少數族裔嘅婦女咧。

28
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:35,870
所以，絕大多數他們在從事基本職業，主要是民族少數，女性在從事住宿和餐飲服務業，25%左右。在就業市場，年長的女性在從事清潔工作。

29
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,690
In the morning, so that many EM women can join. I'm very sorry. We think about that. Okay, next time. Thank you.

30
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:46,460
more in the labour market, build career ladder in their respective working fields, also motivate them.

31
00:05:46,480 --> 00:06:06,490
The labour force participation rate among Nepali, Indian and Pakistani are 63.8%, 55.3% and 18.5% respectively. Pakistani original origin female participation rate are much lower than whole.

32
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:35,440
一個大原因，behind the huge difference may relate to their religious practice. They have to put hijab to cover their head, so there is a prejudice and discrimination in the workplace for skin colour and for dress up. Another reason, if some of them wanted to find job.

33
00:06:43,430 --> 00:07:03,440
社會ly 責任able to take care of their children and family as well as maintain household chores. Household chores. With reference to census in 2016, Nepali, Indian and Pakistani female EAMs median monthly monthly income from main employment are Hong Kong dollar 11.

34
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:38,870
Step for tackle the problems. This is my just minor suggestion. I believe by providing more career-specific trainings, women empowering programmes and confidence-building programmes designated for ethnic minorities women, we will help them to participate more.

35
00:07:46,740 --> 00:08:06,750
如果EM女性可以也踏足在職市場，其他非基本職業，它將有助減輕家庭的財務負擔，改善女性的健康和福祉，以及社會整體的福祉，減少政府在失業相關的開支。

36
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:26,760
福利，和它會肯定允許更多融入社會。謝謝您給我機會。謝謝，Ms. Green。我們現在邀請Ms. Saral Abbas of the Catholic Workers' Centre，請。嗨，everyone。其實我係嚟聚焦貧窮和EM婦女就業，兩者作為。

37
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:46,770
They are connected somehow. EM women mostly they are housewives, but it does not mean that they do not want to work or they are not qualified. Actually, many of them want to go to work to support their families, but they are facing three kinds of obstacles. One is there is no support for child and elderly care.

38
00:08:46,770 --> 00:09:06,780
And then the second one is not enough job seeking network and information. And then the third one is employers' hesitation. As we all know, there are not enough child and elderly care services in Hong Kong. But we have one more barrier, that is, we cannot access to the information on these services. The press

39
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:26,790
HK零一已經cover了故事。然而，社會把 blame 放在那些留在家裡照顧家人的身上。但同時，因為丈夫的收入不足以支付學費、房租和一些我們想要申請的補助。

40
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:46,800
但still we are blamed. So I have to state very clearly that we want paid works, but we need support. Even without care and elderly support, many EM ladies still want to get part time jobs that could suit their timing. However, they experience

41
00:09:46,800 --> 00:10:06,810
Our experience tell tell that no existing information or vacancies are available. They also found that employers are concerned about their cultural or religious practices as well as their customs. For example, in laundry company, our centre contact.

42
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,090
作為我的藥劑師 profession。

43
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:36,880
嘅噉，雖然話誒勞工處話有一下都有嘗試過接觸佢哋，咁但係其實暫時都未有啲好明確嘅成效公佈過嘅。

44
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:27,170
呢個服務應該不限男女，但係今日我哋嘅見到嘅就係女性求職者嘅工作經驗較少，所以需要嘅支援咧係要更加多嘅。唔該，曾生。

45
00:16:47,650 --> 00:17:01,110
When I came to Hong Kong, I applied for practising licence, but due to over-demanding accreditation process, I could not even reach to the examination stage, and after two years, I gave up trying to get registered here.

46
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:48,690
婦女咧可以獲得呢啲誒資訊嘅機會係好少嘅，對於香港嘅職場咧認識都好少嘅，咁更加莫講話講一啲勞工權益嘅上面嘅嘢啦，更加唔清楚嘅，咁令到佢哋對於揾工作咧係非常之卻步嘅。

47
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:26,820
他們表達了對聘請一位巴基斯坦婦女，穿著頭巾的擔憂，他們認為這可能會在工作場所引發事故。因為我們的NGO也提供就業服務給EMs。就上述案例而言，我們建議求職者穿著更合身的頭巾。

48
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:46,830
這job that finally removed the employers' worry. The company finally implied that lady, we find that it is so important to have moderators to facilitate the communication between employers and job seekers. The moderators can also help negotiate with the employers.

49
00:10:46,830 --> 00:11:06,840
for suitable time for EM female jobseekers to work, especially with those employers who are always complaining that they do not have enough manpower. Therefore, we urge the labour department to have a designated team to engage with employers, proactively exploring job opportunities and job.

50
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:26,850
有機會與僱主談判，為彈性工作時數，並安排文化敏感度訓練給公司。從我們經驗，更多僱主會願意聘請EM，如果後續的僱傭服務會提供。總結來説，EM女性也是。

51
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:46,860
社會的asset，他們不僅僅是貢獻給他們的家庭，但也是潛在的勞動力給社會。政府應該盡力支持他們，有足夠的兒童和老人照顧服務，以及專門的就業服務，這樣他們也可以貢獻。

52
00:11:46,860 --> 00:12:06,870
talent and get rid of poverty. And one more thing, I just want where I know I know that because it's over the time. Because this the now we are having fasting month and I just feel very bad that why you arrange this meeting at this time. This is the time when we need to be at home to prepare for our fast.

53
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:26,880
and we need to prepare food and this meeting was focused on EM women and you can see there are only few Pakistani women or maybe I think two Pakistani women sitting here and we are fasting too today. The point is that if next time you want to arrange such meeting, I will suggest you to arrange.

54
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:54,470
誒，跟住我哋有請誒天主教香港教區教區勞工牧民中心九龍嘅曾家俊先生，唔該。好，唔該。誒，睇翻今日咧會議咧，由政府提供嘅文件咧，噉啊都提到咧巴基斯坦嘅婦女咧，有誒越嚟越多嘅女性咧係誒參加呢個誒出嚟做嘢啦，勞動市場啦，上升咗六點。

55
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:14,480
九個百分點啦。咁誒，巴基斯坦嘅家庭咧，好多都係大家庭嚟嘅，生活開支都幾大嘅。咁喺呢種狀況之下咧，誒女性要開始出嚟做嘢咧，呢一樣嘢其實我哋覺得都係一個好正常嘅表現。但係我哋睇翻而家現行勞工處嘅服務咧，未必咧真係可以解決到呢啲婦女嘅就業困難嘅。

56
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:34,490
因為呢班婦女咧，好多其實都係一啲主婦啦，冇一啲工作經驗嘅，咁所以誒，佢哋揾工嘅方法咧，通常係揾啲同鄉幫佢做介紹嘅。對比翻誒華人啦，誒佢哋會用誒勞工處嘅就業中心啦，或者用求職網站呢啲噉嘅渠道，但係誒呢班少數族裔嘅。

57
00:13:48,970 --> 00:14:08,980
噉，我認為幫呢班婦女誒最好嘅方法咧，就係主動同佢哋接觸啦，去了解佢哋嘅需要，先可以幫佢哋解決一啲就業有關嘅問題嘅。咁誒現時勞工處誒有冇接觸呢班婦女，其實我哋都唔清楚。雖然咧佢每個區咧都會有中心嘅，但係睇翻咧政府委託港大同埋政策有一組。

58
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,380
十。

59
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,210
job creation is necessary, such as

60
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:10,010
In addition, I faced a lot of challenges in getting other jobs being non-Chinese speaker.

61
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,150
They could not contribute to Hong Kong economy, but ended up staying as dependent.

62
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:28,260
這些 goals are no poverty, health and well-being for everyone and gender equality. Thanks again for your time.

63
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:12,790
亞洲國家仍然受較高貧困風險，因為他們往往依賴相對較少的家庭成員，大多數是男性。

64
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:20,110
Beyond this, it will support to achieve first, third and fifth Sustainable Development Goals, that is SDGs, proposed by United Nations.

65
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:43,430
The office-based jobs requires good writing skills. In absence of writing skill, they are unable to get suitable job, and end up doing low-skilled jobs even after getting good education.

66
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:51,390
在的過程中，我博士，我有機會講到很多族裔少數族裔女性住

67
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:29,270
with the low labour force participation rates, females' contribution to the household income is not significant. Among ethnic minorities living in Hong Kong, South Asians are the most disadvantaged population, followed by Southeast Asians.

68
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:10,650
Achieve their goal. Gender and ethnic diversity should be encouraged and incentivised in the employment sector. For women, employment is not only source of income, but it is also source of empowerment, upliftment of self-esteem and improved well-being.

69
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:28,990
嘅少數族裔人士對主要公共服務的認知和滿意程度研究咧，發現到其實好多少數族裔嘅朋友咧，對於誒政府嘅就業服務嘅認識咧，其實就唔係咁多啊。咁尤其呢班婦女通常都喺屋企啦、街市啦、學校呢啲場場所，對於勞工處啊、E.R.B.啊呢啲服務咧，其實就唔係好認識。

70
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:57,230
咁誒另外啦，即使佢哋揾到勞工處都好咧，我都對翻誒佢哋能唔能夠幫到佢揾工咧係有保留嘅，因為誒勞工處現有嘅模式咧係會幫翻啲誒登記人咧投誒提供翻啲相關嘅空缺資訊啊，或者安排一個面試啊噉樣。咁但係咧誒就好少見到會幫。

71
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:17,240
啲求職者咧解決一啲就業困難嘅，噉我哋嘅經驗上面咧，誒僱主通常對少數族裔嘅朋友咧，佢語文能力咧係有保留嘅，咁所以我哋要打畀個僱主去解釋，誒個少數族裔嘅求職者佢嘅工作能力係點啦，亦都要了解嗰個工作上面，誒有冇啲可以。

72
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:37,250
用誒方便少數族裔嘅方案，例如誒工作嘅指示可唔可以由單語變成雙語啦，甚至譯成佢哋自己嘅家鄉語言啦，或者如果做食物包裝嘅時候，我哋試過建議佢哋用圖誒黐一張圖畀佢，好過寫個文字畀佢，亦都有做過。咁誒要認識可能。

73
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:57,260
啲誒唔同宗教嘅習俗啦，或者我哋試過幫一啲誒伊斯蘭嘅女性誒揾廚房工嘅時候，佢可以特登安排一啲話誒唔需要接觸一啲非清真嘅肉類嘅。咁呢方面嘅嘅部分係需要不斷咁誒同僱主溝通啦、聯絡啦，去不停咁遊説啦，噉啊逐步逐步建立呢。

74
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:17,270
關係嘅噉，所以呢一啲嘅嘅誒噉嘅溝通嘅嘅部分咧，其實暫時就係勞工處最缺乏嘅一個部分嚟嘅。噉啊，所以我哋在此建議誒勞工處嘅就業支援服務咧，係需要持續跟進個求職者嘅個案啦，同埋以個案形式咁去跟咁先可以誒長遠地令到佢哋揾到一份啱佢哋嘅工作而呢。

75
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:47,650
我會 now have Miss Nimesha Vandan, please. Honourable Legislative Members, thank you for giving me your attention. My name is Nimesha Vandan. Currently, I am pursuing PhD from School of Nursing, Hong Kong University. I am a registered pharmacist from India, and I moved to Hong Kong nine years back with my husband due to his job transfer.

76
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:41,230
The routine checkup by the hospital are not informed and instructed to the patients beforehand in order to have smooth process of the translation service.

77
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:30,430
soon I found out that I am not alone. There are many women who are engineer, doctor, pharmacist, nurse, accountants and from various other professions from India who left their job, moved to Hong Kong accompanying their husband, but could not get any opportunity to enter into workforce here, and had to stay at home.

78
00:17:51,670 --> 00:18:11,680
some of them cannot join workforce due to family need or their cultural background where women are not allowed to work outside. Many South Asian families have culture of women being homemaker. However, those ethnic minority women want to utilise their time to make some money and support their family, but they lack any opportunity and assistance.

79
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:32,670
Female ethnic minority students who have received education in Hong Kong local schools are proficient in Cantonese language, mainly speaking and reading. However, they find writing very challenging. According to them, schools put more focus on Cantonese conversation and reading and less on writing. Most of

80
00:18:43,710 --> 00:19:03,720
我們 all know that employment can reduce and eventually eliminate the risk of falling into poverty trap. But this can happen only when more and more people take up employment or involved in higher skilled jobs. According to Ethnic Minority Poverty Report 2014, South Asian though generally self

81
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:52,700
任何 home base 或小規模 jobs for less educated women and job seeking support, access to information and simple accreditation process can help professional women to get back to workforce. Targeted on the job and interactive Chinese language learning assistance can also help ethnic minority women to.

82
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:48,590
Thank you, Miss Wenden. Can we now have Miss Rabina Limbu of the Cleaning Worker Union, please? Thank you. As I represent Cleaning Worker Union, we have majority of women and who are working in the cleaning work, and then they are generally considered as one of the most vulnerable groups in Hong Kong due to their

83
00:20:48,590 --> 00:21:08,600
culture and background and language background. As a woman faces more problems as they must undergo with the cultural insensitivity issues, despite of the interpreter service available in the government hospital and labour department. While arriving at this designated place, it has rose difficulties.

84
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:28,610
因為沒有適當的宣傳資料和指引，關於安排使用翻譯服務的安排，電話通訊的翻譯服務並不夠充分，而且有限。程序和規則沒有在第一階段引入。

85
00:21:41,510 --> 00:22:01,520
There is also no guidance for the right directions to the hospital process and also the medical treatment. And another is language barrier. There is a majority of Nepalese women workers increasing under the subcontracted cleaning company. The companies have least amount of employment protections.

86
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:21,530
And are often not protected by the employment ordinances, which consist of only English language. There is no any standard working hour stated. Not enough resources of labour laws and rights are being provided. For instance, we have some women cleaning workers.

87
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,700
誒少數族裔喺經濟方面發展嘅一啲服務，唔該。

88
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,730
唔該，馬先生，We now have Mrs Monica Limbu of Health Connection, please.

89
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:53,470
其實唔單止係一個一個一種人嚟，其實係包含好多唔同background嘅人，可能係唔同階層。

90
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:41,330
發展委員會，因為我哋見到一份報告咧，其實有雖然有五十幾頁，但係其實有好多篇幅咧都有提到少數族裔，因為佢哋做咗超過一百場嘅focus，噉啊希望誒即係局方或者政府可以多啲考慮呢個意見。唔該。

91
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:28,100
邊咧其實都可以有啲機制，例如好似青年發展委員會，我見佢哋咧之前都做咗多focus group，然之後先寫佢哋報告嘅。可以喺呢啲機制入邊咧，其實讓唔同background、唔同背景嘅少數族嘅婦女咧，可以多啲講佢哋嘅需要。

92
00:29:47,010 --> 00:30:04,680
honourable chairperson, respected council members, I'm Monica Limbu, a registered nurse in Hong Kong and living here for the past poen half years. Today, on behalf of Health Connection as well as a representative of ethnic minority women, I'm going to deliver the issues faced by ethnic minority women in Hong Kong.

93
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:41,540
in with the teaching background, despite of having good qualification records, they are not offered with their required jobs. Hence, they are urged to choose low-paid jobs and are discouraged to choose their own level of jobs. When when seeking for jobs, they are

94
00:22:41,540 --> 00:23:01,550
They mark as unqualified for the job as there there are no any supplement training programmes and further education for adults adult women. So on the policy, I want to recommend the government should make policies for the hospital authority to actively.

95
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:21,560
Arrange the translation service and provide hospital guidelines with leaflets and posters in EM languages. Second, the government should consider amending the employment ordinance to enable those who are not employed under a continuous contract to entitle the

96
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:41,570
full range of employment benefits and lastly, the government should review the labour laws and introduce more policies that cater the women' needs, such as further education for adults and adequate trainings. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Limbo.誒，跟住嚟請香港婦女勞工協會嘅樑子。

97
00:23:41,570 --> 00:24:01,580
欣小姐，唔該。係好，唔該。咁首先第一件事啦，就係因為今日呢個會議係講緊一關一啲少數族裔就業同埋貧窮嘅事宜啦。咁但係好可惜地，就係其實成個會議除咗真係與會者可以講到嘢嘅一啲誒少數族裔朋友有一個傳譯服務之外，我哋見唔到旁聽都可以有呢個傳譯服務嘅，因為。

98
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:21,590
我都見到就係我哋有啲誒街坊朋友，其實佢哋係小數族裔嚟，佢有興趣，但係佢哋冇辦法參與到，佢除非佢坐喺度講嘢。噉，我覺得呢一個係對佢哋成個誒社會參與、成個誒對佢哋議題一個想表達佢哋意見係個阻礙啦。呢個第一件事。咁第二個就係另外一啲。

99
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:41,600
公共服務方面啦，我哋見到誒，其實成個社會，例如誒，我哋有啲會員、有啲工友想去嚟做一個投訴，去勞工處做投訴，或者佢哋要誒揾工，但係勞工處方面係提供唔到一啲可能誒唔同語言，就翻佢哋誒語言嘅一啲資訊畀到佢哋，甚。

100
00:24:41,600 --> 00:25:01,610
甚至去到啊，其實佢哋有冇會可以同到我哋誒上到去尋求幫助嘅人講話啊？其實有一個傳譯服務可以提供咧。一啲我哋誒少數族裔嘅朋友，佢未必知道呢件事，但係我哋見唔到有呢度相關詳細嘅一啲誒可以話到畀佢聽啦。咁另外佢哋貧窮嘅狀況好多時候係關乎於其實。

101
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:21,620
佢哋唔清楚呢個社區有啲乜資源可以提供畀佢哋，包括可能係一啲誒房屋嘅申請，又或者係一啲其他津貼嘅申請。呢方面其實對於佢哋嚟講係唔足夠，佢哋未必清楚啊。原來佢可以申請呢啲噉嘅資訊，或者呢啲噉樣嘅津貼。咁另外第二件事咧，就係誒，我亦都見到我哋社區入邊有好多少數族裔嘅。

102
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:41,630
嘅婦女其實佢哋都有興趣出嚟做嘢，佢哋都想誒工作嘅，但係就礙於好多原因啦，其中包括就係冇一個相適宜嘅託兒服務啦，一啲照顧嘅服務啦。咁例如唔單止係少數族裔工友，本嚟婦女更加係啦。咁但係其實少數族族裔嘅朋友佢哋更加冇。

103
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,940
因為。

104
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,530
但受阻，因為缺乏語言。

105
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,910
become independent and create more job opportunities.

106
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:59,020
We at Health Connection are working to identify the social problems in the ethnic minority community.

107
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,610
to begin with, language barrier is one of the major and common factors that hinders ethnic minority women while seeking employment.

108
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:57,550
一啲嘅common example係一woman with postnatal depression， who finds difficult to discuss about it openly with her doctor。

109
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:23,190
所以， in order to address this issue, I think we can provide like cultural sensitivity training to our health professionals in Hong Kong.

110
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:48,750
Furthermore, ethnic minority women also faces problem while seeking help for health because of lack of support system in healthcare institution in acknowledging the cultural differences in ethnic minority as a whole.

111
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:12,660
Moreover, Hong Kong ageing population and their increasing health need is one of the biggest concern. And on the other hand, there is a shortage of manpower in healthcare workforce. To overcome this issue.

112
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:26,640
ethnic minority women with healthcare background can be trained to enable them to enter into the public health workforce, thereby reducing the healthcare burden and eventually leading to the quality healthcare.

113
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:13,180
Such difficulty is not only because of language problem. Moreover, it is a cultural difference, as postnatal depression is also a subject of taboo in most of the ethnic minority community.

114
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:13,540
and are trying our best to reach a solution. Your help to support us in any way will be highly appreciated. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs Limbu. And now we have Ms Farah Beckham of the Kwai Chung Ethnic Minority Rights Concern Group, please.

115
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:58,980
在 addition， the available job training is mostly limited to few areas like food and beverage industry, housekeeping, beauty care. My point here is， can we extend the training facilities in further sectors？

116
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:41,810
to better understand the cultural need of ethnic minority. Likewise, what we have witnessed in the community is that most of the ethnic minority women tend to be employed in low skilled occupation, resulting in low income level, and are much likely to be in poor economic condition.

117
00:25:41,630 --> 00:26:01,640
一個適當嘅託兒服務，噉佢哋冇辦法可以放低佢哋家庭嘅小朋友出嚟做嘢，但係其實佢哋都有興趣去工作啦。咁另外呢件事就係誒成個對於誒少數族裔佢出嚟做嘢嘅嗰個工作培訓，其實係唔足夠。佢哋可能喺家鄉，佢哋有自己誒嘅一

118
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:21,650
個學歷已經喺度，但係嚟到香港唔認受，而都冇相關嘅一啲持續進修嘅計劃畀佢哋，導致佢哋即使佢哋有能力、佢哋有呢個誒，佢哋願意去投入呢個勞動市場，都其實佢哋未必投入得到。另外就係部分嘅婦女，佢哋因為家庭文化嘅原因，可能未必。

119
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:41,660
可以投入一個傳統嘅誒勞動市場，但係對於佢哋嚟講嘅一啲另類經濟嘅發展，其實而家社會上係冇呢個空間同埋資源。咁所以我都希望就係政府，無論喺語言上一啲部門上申請資源上面，可以提供多啲語言之外，其實喺一個都可以撥多啲資源去做一啲。

120
00:26:45,980 --> 00:27:05,990
唔該，梁小姐，跟住我哋請仁愛堂社區中心嘅馬浩坤先生，唔該。唔該，主席。噉就我見今日嘅話題，其實誒可以講貧窮，同埋應該話個主角咧，其實係少數族裔婦女啊。咁其實我想集中係講緊少數族裔婦女咧個參與程度。噉就誒，其實我之前嚟嘅時候咧，我係嘗試去揾下婦委會。

121
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:26,000
會其實佢哋啲資料啦噉樣噉，發現咧，其實喺庫委會入邊，其實都有少少有嘅朋友嘅，不過得一位嘅啫。咁但係再揾多少資料，我其實都會覺得就誒中英誒對照咧，係一個好基本嘅東西嚟嘅。咁但係發覺喺網頁上面咧，其實誒面嗰陣嘅資料咧，其實都係by lingo嘅。但係如果想知得詳細啲，要

122
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:46,010
睇report一啲PDF file咧，基本上全部都得中文版本嘅。但係嗰啲中文版本咧，其實都好嘢嚟嘅，一啲good practice嚟嘅。咁所以我估第一個位咧，其實喺婦女參與嘅時候，其實要多啲考慮。第二樣嘢咧就係我知道委員會咧，其實佢哋都誒會定期開會。但我估係一位代表，其實佢因為少數族裔咧。

123
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,390
Thank you, Miss Beckenham.

124
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,990
and the thing why the E.M. women are

125
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,660
First off, and childcarers, and is it okay if I continue to talk?

126
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:40,070
因為 mainly， especially for EM woman， they came to Hong Kong because of family reunion。

127
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:14,140
therefore, I think compulsory induction programme should be provided for all of ethnic minority new arrivals.

128
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,370
such as seeing doctor, using public transport or seeking job, finding schools for their children or applying for social welfare.

129
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:59,110
like they are lag behind to to to work. It's also because there are lack of EM friendly childcare services.

130
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:45,070
to follow up or and provide support to them initiativeally, and secondly, because today's topic is also about poverty and employment.

131
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:21,520
所以， in order to have EM friendly childcare service centre, I think there should be halal food should be provided and there should be cultural sensitivity training.

132
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:10,140
因為，Besides， most of of their staff cannot speak fluent English， so if EM parents want to register， they said it's better they reserve a social worker first.

133
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:57,960
and quite a lot of them they came from village with low educational level and most of them they cannot even speak English because of their low education and language and culture barrier. EM women have difficulties in adapting to Hong Kong society.

134
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:58,140
要book and reserve places according to the staff, but however they cannot provide halal food, so the EM parents have to prepare the food for their kids. And the staff also said that the EM parents use this service for half day or few days before, but it's very rare.

135
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:13,760
唔同背景、唔同宗教噉啊！咁頭先都有朋友講到好好，就係譬如話誒誒穆斯林嘅朋友，今日呢個鐘數咧對佢嚟講係特別吃力㗎啦。因為頭先我望一望咧，陣間佢哋開齋時間咧係七點零九分。咁如果係婦女嚟講咧，其實佢哋真係要忙於咧就係呢段時間咧，其實要預備咗你屋企嘅嘢。咁所以啊，會唔會喺婦委會入？

136
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:48,390
呢個第一個建議，第二個建議咧就係其實我見到富慧會入邊咧有好多誒，真係培訓啊或者啲發展機會咧，其實真係想睇得仔細啲咧，其實都係中文版本嘅嗰啲PDF入邊啊，可可唔可以真係喺資訊上面可以即係誒多諗？其實有英文版本可以對證啦。第二樣嘢咧，其實頭先都提到就係個參與程度。

137
00:28:48,390 --> 00:29:08,400
咁重要就係其實我哋有個概念叫即係宗教友善啊。其實唔單止係有族裔，譬如話頭先提到就係誒，可能係物好似家下噉樣，其實真係誒齋戒。其實對穆斯林嘅朋友咧，喺一啲開會，其實我哋中心咪開會開組咧，其實我哋真係要就嘅。甚至乎我哋啲年青人，莫講婦女咧，其實佢哋都唔好遠眼就嚟，因為做。

138
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:28,410
討論嘅事咁熱啦，咁所以喺如果能夠將佢哋啲諗法可以帶入機制入邊咧，成日我相信喺喺一啲官方安排課程嘅數字咧，應該係有改善嘅，因為通常搞班咧都發現有好多唔同困難咧，佢哋嚟唔到。但係如果啲諗法可以擺得到入去咧，就會相當好好。誒，我想再強調多一次咧，其實個good practice咧係青年。

139
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:32,900
holding despite holding certain professional attributes and academic qualification, as mentioned earlier, being a registered nurse in Hong Kong, I've applied in various hospitals, but was rejected from all of them. Not only me, there are many other ethnic minority women with healthcare background and are willing to join the healthcare industry.

140
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:49,140
similarly, provision to promote entrepreneurship among ethnic minority women to start their own enterprise would help in empowering empowering as well as upgrading their life standard. Providing assistance in the form of subsidised courses on social business or subsidised loan would help them to

141
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:33,850
Thank you, Chairman. Like all of fellow mates, they all talk about poverty and employment assistance, but I also want to highlight another main issue because, like how so how to facilitate EM women to adapt to Hong Kong society is also prerequisite.

142
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,770
One。

143
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,860
which are like.

144
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,130
有好多 varieties。

145
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,390
Department could do much in this regard because they got authority.

146
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,340
Next, we have Mrs. Indira Magary of the AIM group, please.

147
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:42,150
I think some of them doesn't even know what is ERB stand for. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, Ms. Picken.

148
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:17,630
take care of children， so mother has to sacrifice herself to born in home to look after children。

149
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:38,310
我 want to have some part time job to support my husband, because it is not easy to live and survive in Hong Kong. But it seems to be impossible because I'm free for three hours in the morning, and it is difficult to find work during these hours.

150
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:35,100
要讓他們學簡單的中文，與香港社會相似，例如規則、規範和社區資源。所以，我認為引導計劃可以由政府提供，或外包給NGO提供服務。或，新移民名單可以給NGO。

151
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:20,080
所以，like for our community，because for special，I think I can highlight on Kwai Chung。We had a neighbourhood sport childcare project in Kwai Chung，and our committee member called to ask some information，and they said since the childcarers are volunteers and most of

152
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:40,090
them doesn't know English, so the staff said they usually usually they are unwilling to take care of EM child. So it means basically EM child cannot use home-based child service. And even though the centres has centre-based childcare service, EM parents are welcome to back.

153
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:50,160
Go ahead, please. Okay, thank you. Because mostly for the EM women, their qualifications is outside of Hong Kong and it's not really recognised in Hong Kong. Like most of them, they attend degrees or masters in their home countries, but because their qualifications are not.

154
00:36:50,160 --> 00:37:10,170
aggregated in Hong Kong, so this also caused them difficult to find jobs which match which match their qualifications. So they ended up finding low skill jobs which restrict their opportunities of upward social mobility. And lastly, there are vocational courses provided for EM, actually which doesn't

155
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:35,270
They are mainly about service industry, tourism, construction and Chinese language, which is very like it's limited choices for ethnic minorities. And besides, the promotion of the courses are also not enough. The EM doesn't even know about the ERB courses or, and sometime.

156
00:37:49,360 --> 00:38:09,370
Thank you. Hi, I am Indira from AM Group. Mostly ethnic minority women are blame that they do not want to work and support the family. But I want to tell you that reality is not like that. Sometimes, sometimes we do not have close relatives living in Hong Kong who can.

157
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:40,310
The one, the other hand, there are also elderly in our homes who need our attention and care. And again, wife has to stay home to take care of them. Ethnic ethnic minority community mostly unaware of elderly service and support offered by government. Even

158
00:38:40,310 --> 00:39:00,320
They know it is really difficult to reach to those service if you do not know language. For childcare service, we cannot offer private service, and for non-profit making NGO service, there is long waiting list. So it is almost impossible for ethnic minority woman to work.

159
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,620
佢個婦女去上就讀嘅，咁可唔可以咧？誒，考慮咧豁免佢哋喺家鄉嘅學歷。

160
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:20,330
我係 housewife 現在。我用以幫 elderly 在我社區盡可能多，例如幫佢哋買雜貨、帶佢哋去醫院、煮飯畀佢哋，等等。以前我冇仔女，我喺唔同行業工作，但係而家有仔女之後，我係天生。

161
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:59,080
我知 many ablest woman who has few hours free every day, but they cannot find suitable jobs during that time. I want to demand Labour Department to cooperate and communicate with different companies and try to open some jobs and suit suit to woman timing. Labour.

162
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:24,510
they should build close relation with companies and encourage them for such on such job opening. Many companies always complain that they have shortage of labour and they want to import the labour, but actually the labour is in Hong Kong. Why not labour department negotiate?

163
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:44,520
with these companies for working hours and encourages them more to hire EM women. Because of language inability, EM women cannot negotiate for themselves. Labour departments should engage with these companies and make arrangements for more jobs opportunity for EM women. Thank you.

164
00:40:45,150 --> 00:41:05,160
Thank you, Mr. MacRory。誒，跟住我哋有請香港社會服務聯會嘅羅林女士，唔該。係唔該，主席。咁咧誒，近年咧少數嘅人口上升啦，咁咧其實如果配合咧適當嘅教育同埋就業培訓咧，其實佢哋可以成為香港嘅寶貴嘅人力資源啦，加強香港嘅勞動市場嘅。咁誒，我哋有七個誒建議。

165
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:25,170
啦，或者係關注點啦。咁希望儘量有時間可以講曬啦嚇。咁第一咧就希望咧誒誒政府可以帶頭去拼精消嘅族裔嘅噉，可以放寬呢個中文能力嘅要求啦。誒雖然都知道咧誒，有而家有誒五廿二個嘅職級啦，咁但係其實都希望可以再考慮可以放寬多一啲啦，同埋個職級咧個要求可以再。

166
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:45,180
中文嘅能力係可以略為低一啲，因為咧其實好多小學做嘢，一啲香港土生土長嘅話咧，就算佢受咗十二年嘅教育啦嚇，學咗十二年中文，但係可能佢中文只係得小三嘅程度嘅啫。咁所以咧，其實誒喺呢個過渡期啦嚇，我都知道，即係雖然咧政府係投放資源去誒，即係加強嗰個中文嘅學習啦，咁但係可能。

167
00:41:45,180 --> 00:42:05,190
喺呢個過渡期裏面咧，即係呢十年八載咧，都可能要畀多啲支援佢哋嘅。咁誒，例如話可以喺公共服務裏面咧去聘請呢啲小户族裔嘅，好似勞工處、社處、房處、啊醫管局等等啦。我知道咧，即係社處同埋勞工處都有聘請，不過都係兩三個職位，睇下可唔可以增加多一啲，尤其是啲嘅小户族裔聚居嘅地方咧。

168
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:25,200
其實咧可以聘請多啲小業族裔啦，咁咧等到佢哋咧可以外展到去佢哋小業族裔嘅社羣嗰度，咁宣傳翻各類型嘅公共服務啦，包括咗好似積樽啊、社會服務啊、福利啊、託兒服務啊、職業安全啊、親子教育等等，其實都係幫緊大家一啲嘅服務可以宣傳達到去佢哋嘅社羣嗰度。

169
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:45,210
咁另外咧喺童工裏面咧，如果你有小學族裔嘅話咧，都知道小學族裔文化嘅特色啦，喺一個最自然嘅文化敏感度培訓嚟嘅。好，第二點咧就希望咧誒政府咧亦都可以提供一啲實習機會畀小學族裔嘅，例如話一啲嘅服務大使，例如ambassador噉樣樣。雖然而家只係勞工處可以做啫，咁希望可以其他。

170
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:08,900
一個誒公務員一啲嘅職級啦，係去到咧有五十三個誒其實嘅即係職級咧係可以咧係誒誒有一個較低嘅中文水平嘅要求咧係可以加入嘅，噉係誒一次過咧係新增咗二十二個嘅誒職級嘅。

171
00:42:45,210 --> 00:43:05,220
其他嘅公營服務咧都可以畀佢哋有機會咧去進行六個月嘅見習或者培訓噉樣。第三點，希望勞工處或者社處咧可以參考咧誒殘疾人士嘅在職培訓計劃咁咧，等佢哋可以係誒有見習啦，同埋咧即啊即係在職試用嘅機會噉，同埋咧畀一啲嘅補即係誒一啲嘅濕實。

172
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:25,230
啦，即係補助金畀啲僱主噉，等佢咧誒，亦都可以有之後一啲嘅就業嘅個案嘅跟進，同埋咧係處理翻一啲僱主同埋僱員之間嘅溝通或者文化差異引出嘅問題嘅第四點噉，希望擴闊工種同埋就業機會，好似咧機管局咧而家同非牟非牟利機構咧合作咗做一個project叫。

173
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:45,240
extra mile叫理想高飛嘅計劃，畀小族類嘅女性咧，可以喺機場嗰度擔任一啲顧客服務啦。等佢哋咧可以發揮佢哋所長，尤其是英語嘅能力嘅所長。咁其實政府可以考慮喺醫療服務嗰度咧，畀更加多嘅工種等小族類去發揮，因為好多醫療文件其實都係寫英文嘅。噉佢講廣東話係。

174
00:43:45,240 --> 00:44:05,250
應該冇問題，有好多都咁可以等佢哋咧，即係可以擴闊多啲工種，唔係淨係做一啲地盤啊或者保安噉樣。咁第嗯，可唔可以先繼續？好，唔該。第五點咧，希望咧僱員再培訓局咧可以豁免少少喺家鄉裡面一啲學歷，因為好多時候佢嘅鄉家鄉裡面學歷咧，其實香港係唔承認嘅。誒，例如有啲牙。

175
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:25,260
牙醫啊，或者誒英文老師啊，佢係喺碩士噉，但係香港根本就唔承認噉。但係咧好奇怪咧，即係顧研再培訓局咧，又會因為佢哋呢啲嘅資歷咧係唔即係唔唔，因為佢唔合資格去上呢啲嘅課程。咁其實好可惜嘅，因為咧其實顧研再培訓局一啲嘅中誒職業中文嘅課程啊，或者其他課程咧，其實都好適合南亞。

176
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:51,080
第六點咁咧就係誒睇入境處可唔可以誒提供一啲少數族裔新來港嘅少數族裔嘅名單，因為咧而家咧我哋發覺即係好多時候都誒啲新來港，我哋係冇佢哋嘅誒，即係如果係內地新來港咧，其實係有名單去畀各區嘅N G O嘅，但係咧少數族裔嘅新來港咧就係冇呢一個服務噉，所以而家。

177
00:44:51,080 --> 00:45:11,090
啲NGO咧係要拍門啦、上門洗樓咧，先至可以接觸到佢哋嘅，噉就未必係咁即係方便佢哋融入香港社會啦。第七點咧就關於誒政府預留咗五億去誒加強需要做嘅支援嘅，咁睇會唔會？我知道下次立法會咧都會誒討論呢個議題，咁睇會唔會可以主席考慮都可以開放去做一個公聽會噉。

178
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:31,100
噉我知道好多少數做義慈份者都好關注呢個即係議題啦。咁可以等佢哋都有個參與。其實琴日我哋都有見有機會見到司長啦，即係誒張建忠司長咁去反映嘅意見。咁其實大家提出好多問題，尤其是就住咧誒放咗每年咧放咗二點五億落去個教育嗰度咧，即係中小學個支援，但係似乎嗰個效果咧係達唔到嘅。

179
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:13,590
誒，係唔該，誒多謝主席，咁亦都誒多謝咁多位誒嘅朋友咧頭先嘅發言嘅，咁誒或者我先簡介一下誒而家呢一個即係誒少數族裔嘅人士同埋佢哋嘅女性嘅貧窮嘅情況啦。其實誒文件入邊都講咗嘅，咁頭先誒咁多位亦都即係誒有同我哋表達到的而且確咧誒，因為少數族裔。

180
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:33,600
嘅家庭咧，好多時都係大家庭，咁誒兒童嘅數目比較多啦。噉我哋見到誒嗰個家庭經濟嘅負擔咧，係相對嚟講比較沉重。咁好多時係即係即使係一啲在職嘅家庭咧，事實上誒可能淨係得佢爸爸誒個男士出去誒工作，噉就去即係承擔嘅生計。噉我哋見到亦都係即係呢個情況係誒好普遍。

181
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:53,610
嘅咁當然係即係誒少數族裔嘅女性咧，好多時誒都好似頭先誒好多同誒朋友所講咧，因為佢哋要即係可能要照顧屋企，咁所以可以即係全身投入去到職場咧誒嘅機會，可能未必即係話誒一定好多。咁但係我哋都見到其實喺誒過去嘅數字顯示咧，誒喺一一年至到一六年。

182
00:46:53,610 --> 00:47:13,620
間咧唔同嘅羣族嘅勞動人口參與率咧都有上升嘅咁誒，亦都南亞裔嘅女性嘅上升咧嘅誒幅度咧去到誒五點七個百分點，其中咧誒巴基斯坦嘅婦女咧就比較明顯嘅上升咗誒六個百分點。噉我哋都希望咧誒呢一啲係即係有一個即係誒繼續有咁誒比較即係誒誒正面嘅進。

183
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:33,630
展啦，咁咁當然誒，其實我哋都想講誒貧窮數字係即係好多因素誒反映出嚟嘅綜合結果嘅，包括咗誒嗰時嘅經濟狀況啊、誒人口結構啊，同埋少數族裔即係本身個家庭嗰個即係譬如人數啊，都會有影響嘅。咁誒，至於想幫助一啲即係誒少數族裔嘅婦女去工作咧。

184
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:06,410
冇教育局嘅同事喺度啊，係嘛，主席？噉就誒，因為我喺地區都接觸過一啲個案，其實都好多誒。

185
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:19,090
嘅話咧，我哋委員提問之後再會議嘅嘛。好，誒，由於我哋時間相對充裕，我哋就每每位五分鐘先啦。尹兆堅議員嘅。

186
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:52,230
誒，而家我哋就或者請政務司司長私人辦公室特別職務組嘅副總監毛婉清女士，就剛才公眾人士發言咧，作咁多嘢嘅回應先。

187
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:42,940
噉我哋都希望咧資源咧，即係用得其所，又係見到有成效嘅。希望都立啊立法會都去加強呢個監管。唔該曬。好，唔該曬，李Sir。係公聽會，我哋下一次十七月十七號個會議應該會有嘅嚇。多謝你。

188
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:53,640
頭先我哋都聽到誒，即係唔同嘅朋友都有反映，而家係有一啲即係誒地方可以改善。咁但係其實我哋都知道誒，即係譬如我哋誒同事啦，勞工處嗰方面咧都已經即係喺過去都嘗試即係誒越誒即係加強佢哋呢一方面嘅功夫嘅，包括咗譬如喺一四年開始就誒誒推行咗呢個少數族裔嘅。

189
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:13,650
就業服務大使計劃啦。咁頭先亦都有即係誒誒在座嘅朋友有提到。噉我哋喺呢個計劃底下咧，其實就誒誒透過呢一個誒展翅清健嘅計劃下邊咧誒，聘用咗一啲即係誒會講少數族裔語言嘅學員咧做呢個就業服務大使。咁誒做咗呢幾年以嚟咧，都有誒誒一百一七一百一十七。

190
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:33,660
個大事咧係誒參加過呢個計劃，而當中咧有超過七成咧係女性學員嚟嘅。咁誒再進一步咧，其實勞工處亦都喺一七年五月開始咧喺西九龍就業中心咧係誒請咗兩個識得誒講少數族裔語言嘅就業助理啦，希望咧亦都去試一試呢一方面嘅服務咧，係可唔可以幫到誒嚟求職嘅？

191
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:53,670
誒少數族裔嘅人士啦，以及咧係加強呢啲少數就誒族裔人士，譬如喺政府入邊工作嘅經驗啊等等嘅。咁頭先亦都有朋友講啦，譬如其實誒即係政府作為最大嘅即係僱主咧，我哋亦都喺最近一完成咗一個即係語文嘅程度嘅檢討嘅。噉我哋喺誒今年初亦都咧係即係推展咗咧將誒誒呢。

192
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:29,740
咁至於喺即係誒支援呢啲女性誒嘅誒少數族裔女性嘅就業支援方面咧，咁誒再培訓局其實都有特別咧預留一啲學額咧，係畀呢啲少數族裔嘅人士參加啦。特別咧仲要係誒，如果係一啲同即係就業掛鈎課程嘅誒少數族裔嘅學員咧，係提供一個比較長，希望即係譬如有。

193
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:49,750
六個月噉樣嘅就業跟進嘅咁誒，至於婦女方面咧，誒，我哋都知道佢哋都安排緊咧，希望有一啲即係關於健康護理業嘅課程咧，會喺嚟緊誒一八一九個年度咧，就會誒提供一啲英文嘅教材。咁好似頭先有一啲在座朋友咁講咧，希望亦都可以即係幫到佢哋咧投身呢一個即係健康護理業嘅。

194
00:49:50,310 --> 00:50:10,320
咁誒，當然啦。其實我哋都明白有一啲嘅屋企，可能真係誒，佢哋嘅即係母親啊，有好多家務誒誒嘅誒負擔啦，未必可以即係誒誒去到誒入到職場。咁喺呢一方面，其實我哋一向都即係鼓勵佢哋尋求誒社會嘅福利嘅津貼啦。咁例如係誒喺一六年誒推出嘅誒。

195
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:30,330
低收入在職家庭津貼啦，喺誒今年四月一號咧就誒改咗名做在職家庭津貼。咁其實改名同時咧係誒實施咗一係列嘅改善措施嘅。咁亦都係誒希望，亦都係提高咗個金額啦。噉我哋都好鼓勵其實少數族裔嘅朋友咧，如果有需要咧係可以去申請呢個津貼嘅。例如我哋即係睇過。

196
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:50,340
誒，假設一個低收入有四個細路仔嘅誒，在職家庭咧，佢哋可能一個月可以攞到譬如超過五千蚊嘅津貼，相信對於佢哋嘅即係屋企嘅情況都有幫助。噉，但係我哋都明白誒誒，有一啲少數族裔嘅家庭咧，或者佢哋嘅人士可能未必好清楚呢啲資訊。咁其實誒誒，有關嘅辦事處啦，你生日辦事處咧，亦都。

197
00:50:50,340 --> 00:51:10,350
係誒做緊多啲嘅功夫，希望可以將呢啲信息咧係即係傳遞到畀佢哋呢啲少數族裔嘅朋友嘅。咁除咗話即係有一啲即係誒誒文件啊、誒單張嘅翻譯本係做咗出嚟之外咧，噉佢哋嘅熱線啦、誒翻譯服務啦，亦都係有提供到嘅。甚至乎咧係誒亦都會咧係盡量想去呢一啲。

198
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:30,360
有誒多啲比較少數族裔小朋友翻學嘅學校咧，係去嗰度直情係學校嗰度誒辦諮詢會啦，誒設置單誒一啲嘅即係誒一啲嘅誒誒櫃位啦噉樣。希望就係喺嗰啲情況咧，可以接觸到嗰啲少數族裔嘅小朋友啦，同埋佢哋嘅父母啦，噉就將呢啲資訊咧誒再提供多一啲。

199
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:50,370
咁喺今年嘅四月至到十二月期間咧，其實誒辦事處咧亦都係委託咗咧超過七十個嘅即係誒非政府機構嘅服務單位，包括係即係服務少數族裔朋友嘅單位咧，就希望可以有多啲嘅即係誒誒去到直直接接觸佢哋啦，幫佢哋。如果係第一次申請呢一個積樽嘅即係朋友咧，就可以。

200
00:51:50,370 --> 00:52:10,380
填寫嗰個申請表嘅咁其實誒，我哋喺文件嗰度亦都提過，或者頭先亦都有誒在座嘅朋友提過啦。為咗希望可以加強到即係政府喺誒即係支支援少數人士方面嘅工作咧，咁誒其實政務司司長咧就誒會親身主持一個跨局嘅督導委員會，噉就去即係誒。

201
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,060
係，唔該。

202
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,710
批一啲噉嘅服務畀佢做咧，唔該主席。好啊。

203
00:57:49,990 --> 00:58:00,050
誒數字仲可以搭長少少得唔得啊？主席，係啊，我咁誒時間上睇下啲數字上，如果今次唔有提供到，我會後提供啦。其他問題嘅話係邊位負責咧？好啊，唔該，部女士。

204
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:30,390
睇翻我哋誒內部係嗰個工作，而家去到咩情況啦？噉樣咁有啲咩可以改善嘅地方啦？咁其實誒我哋誒亦都誒已經咧係誒舉辦咗兩場嘅焦點嘅誒誒小組會議啦。喺五月底同埋喺琴日噉就誒見過誒超過四十個咧，其實係誒少數族裔嘅填。

205
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:50,400
團體啦，同埋啲服務提供者嘅，咁都誒司長係親身即係誒聽咗誒大家嘅意見啦。噉我哋即係希望整合咗啲意見之後咧，就會畀翻即係誒個督導委員會去考慮同埋跟進一下。其實誒，譬如頭先有啲誒朋友提過話誒，會唔會可以喺一啲誒即係誒就職方面。

206
00:52:50,400 --> 00:53:10,410
提供多啲一啲誒個案跟進嘅功夫啊，噉樣咁呢啲我哋都係持開放嘅態度嘅。咁亦都誒，知道小組委員會下一個誒會議，亦都邀請我哋翻嚟，即係再誒報告一下嗰個進度噉樣。咁或者我誒初步嘅回應係誒噉樣啦。咁誒，我唔知我啲同事有冇特別嘅補充。有邊位其他政政府代表需要現階段發言？因為。

207
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:39,610
好多主席係五分鐘，我應該問到啲問題嘅啊。聽，唔係應該咁講，我我實問到啦。希望答到啲問題啊，主席。誒，第一個我先講咗，我哋先啊，即係自省唔新啊，主席。我哋我記得咧，我哋提過，我哋自己立法會咧都希望做得好啲㗎嘛。喺全職服務上，我希望即係下次我哋都誒翻去傾傾啲辦法，可以解決到。

208
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:59,620
如果咪每次有誒少少在場朋友嚟到都有依個質詢咧，我自己都覺得我哋質詢政府嘅時候，自己都諗諗我哋係咪做得可以好啲咧？噉就第一個誒，我我好同意嘅。剛才有人講到教育嗰個問題啦，誒，我覺得其中嘅學歷認證或者個銜接點協助佢哋誒可以得到香港認可學歷嗰個重要嘅。可惜今。

209
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:26,700
少少弱弱嘅朋友，無論男性或者女性咧，有幾比較好嘅學歷或者資歷嘅。不過嚟到不幸就誒唔能夠誒揾多啲吻合佢嘅工作，咁變咗就有種即係誒中國人講啊高不成低不就嘅狀態啦。噉就都糾纏好耐，到最後佢都可能要面對現實啦。咁但係其實喺

210
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:46,710
某個角度講咧，其實司長而家成立嗰個誒小組，其實都係講人力資源㗎嘛。其實我哋嘥咗一啲我哋香港嘅人力資源嘅。噉我覺得呢一度係需要諗諗。我希望佢即係一間體育部門同事，如果代答到一答啦。如果政務司司長嗰邊答唔到，就睇下下次會唔會教育各方面要補充下，如何協助到呢一啲朋友。

211
00:54:46,710 --> 00:55:06,720
喺嗰個教育上，或者佢個個人能力上，可以可以誒有個認證，或者係可以涵接到。第二個咧，我淨係聽見好多服務數字啊。每次我哋開呢啲會咧，我同阿主席相信都聽冇冇十場都有八場啦，都好重複嘅啲講法。咁但係，似乎我哋聽翻少少逐漸嘅朋友嚟到，都係好多嘅誒投訴。

212
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:26,870
噉我自己地區嘅觀感就係都好多服務其實唔係好到位，包括正話提及一啲嘢，我知佢有做嘅，不過就我見剛才好好急促咁講，就冇講數據啊。例如我哋見到地區，譬如誒好多在職家庭，有時譬如巴基斯坦、瑞嘅誒人口比較多，而佢一個人揾食咁低樽，原來好多人冇。

213
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:46,880
申請嘅噉，剛才誒部門嘅講法就係話誒，佢哋會有啲文件啊、單張啊會做啊噉樣，甚至會去同啲NGO合作，但係冇數據嘅主席，譬如嗰啲嘅外展服務接觸咗幾多人次都有啲數，可唔可以交畀我哋咧？另外，譬如有七十個NGO協助你，我知佢邊啲車有政府服務，即係社會福利處資助嘅機構。

214
00:55:46,880 --> 00:56:06,890
佢有做一啲少少俗類嘅服務嘅，噉佢例如譬如低津落去一個例子，或者其他一啲社會服務啦，佢做過接觸過幾多數翻嚟畀部門咧，可唔可以話畀我哋聽咧？從而我哋先評估到佢效益㗎嘛。佢梗係有做㗎，你印咗張單張有㗎啦，印咗五萬張，不過擺咗喺度派咗五十張啫噉樣，即係我覺得。

215
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:26,900
噉，如果唔係我哋好不著邊際，我發覺我哋都傾咗好多次，但係都重複呢個。我希望有關嘅數字唔好淨係流於就係我又有邊個項目，而係希望佢轉頭都答到我。另外咧，主席我都想問下佢，即係提到有個數好奇怪嘅，就係嗰個誒就業服務大市嗰度啦。佢就話。

216
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:46,910
誒有一百一十七人次啊，咁實際而家剩幾多？可唔可以講埋？咁另外西九龍嗰個就支援服務點解淨係擺西九龍擺兩個咧？即係誒東九龍冇需要嘅，阿朱席利嗰個區啊嘛，係咪先？即係無視你，全又更加無視我哋新界區啦，係咪？新界最多嘅，新界東西係最多少少少數族裔嘅人口嘅，點解又冇咧？

217
00:56:46,910 --> 00:57:06,920
嗱，依啲我覺得誒不得其解嘅。咁另外文件第二提到社署嗰度，亦都係有啲每區委派指定嘅同事噉樣。咁到底有幾多人啊？即係我太覺得太口行行呢啲解釋。即係我我信佢有嘅，但係係咪到位係咪足夠？依啲係張建忠成日講嘅，即係我都學咗司長嘅講法。

218
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:26,930
最後我講多十秒到啦，主席。誒呢個係都係緊要嘅，就係而正話都講咗好多誒少族裔家庭有啲特別需要。你唔能夠香港本身嘅託兒服務都不足，我哋香港香港本地婦女都好多投訴呢一類本地而係外籍嘅婦女面對嘅困難，我相信更大。我睇。

219
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:46,940
睇數字咧就好一大堆咩誒互助幼兒中心啊、倫理支援幼兒服務啊、暫託服務啊，全部都有。但係我見入邊大部分都係本地嘅啲志願機構嚟嘅，似乎就冇誒少數族裔機構嘅。而我知道誒，其實少數族裔本身都有好龐大嘅族羣嘅組織嘅，點解唔充分利用呢啲方法或者？

220
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:20,580
係誒，多謝誒委員，多謝誒主席。咁或者誒今日係教育局嘅同事唔喺度啦。咁但係我手上有少少資料咧，其實就係誒扶貧委員會咧喺舊年誒都誒通過咗一個關愛基金嘅項目嘅。噉就係咧，希望可以誒資助呢一啲持有誒非本地學歷同埋有經濟需要合資格人士咧，可以向翻。

221
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:40,590
翻呢一個香港學術同埋誒職業誒資歷評審局申請咧一個誒一個學歷評估嘅，即係話頭先亦都有一啲朋友講過，即係佢哋可能喺外地誒讀咗一啲誒嘅誒課程一啲學位啊噉樣。噉我哋其實係有一個機制咧，可以盡量咧幫翻呢啲即係誒攞咗一啲非本地學歷嘅少數族裔嘅人士。

222
00:58:40,590 --> 00:59:00,600
咧去到誒做翻個學歷評估嘅咁呢個服務其實就誒舊年開始推行就做三年噉樣嘅噉，如果有需要即係誒啲朋友都可以去嗰度誒攞翻啲資料噉樣咯。咁誒至於誒頭先關於誒勞工處啊誒社處嗰啲誒數字，我睇下我同事有冇補充。如果冇，可能我哋會後提供有冇補充？

223
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:36,250
啊，同埋當然，我唔知道而家嗰個督導委員會進展到咩程度咧，就主要想第一個問題。

224
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:10,060
作佢做啫嘛，佢哋本身有好多地區上嘅一啲嘅支援團體，或者佢哋，我我唔知佢叫誒。

225
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:59,510
就亦都多謝啲少少場嘅朋友嚟畀意見啦。咁其實正話都有社聯嘅朋友咧，畀一啲好具體嘅意見。

226
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:30,400
裏面去做一啲聚焦嘅小組咧，就聽意見啦。其實嗱，我主要想問咧，其實好多意見都畀過，嗰個結果會估計會幾時會出？

227
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:53,490
咁第二個咧，其實正話都有提到社會婦女嗰個誒，尤其是婦女嗰個就業同培訓嗰啲問題。咁當然最大嘅困難咧，誒聽到另外啲朋友講，包括即係託兒嗰個唔足夠啦。咁但係咧，當然咧就誒，我而家睇到你文件第二十段咧都有提到咧就。

228
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:23,100
誒彭潔玲女士係誒講翻嗰個我哋每一個地區咧有一啲嘅指定嘅誒人員咧專責去支援翻前線同事係去協助啲少數族裔嘅誒求助嘅人士咧。咁其實我哋係誒寫住有十一個行政區，我哋每一個行政區底下咧係會有一位指定。

229
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:43,110
嘅同事噉佢咧就唔係直接去支援啲少數做嘢嘅，佢支援翻我哋自己前線嘅同事咧，就係誒指導佢哋咧點樣幫啲即係求助者嘅。咁至於喺嗰個誒幼兒嘅誒託管嘅服務嗰度咧，咁誒多謝議員嘅意見啦。我哋翻嚟都可以再誒諗一諗嚇。

230
00:59:43,110 --> 01:00:03,120
不過就即係誒，可能我哋都係要去睇一睇嗰個需求啦。咁同埋頭先都講咗，其實我哋有啲服務都係誒，就算本地嘅嘅誒市民咧，都係可能係要輪候啊，唔足㗎。噉我哋呢度，我哋再翻去睇一睇。啊，補充一點啫，一個冇事。輔助幼兒中心你係畀啲Angie做㗎嘛？你資

231
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:30,630
騎到騎到失啦嚇，我簡單咁講，噉就其實可以畀佢哋做喎，噉啊解決到咯，又幫到你手又幫到佢手，可唔可以考慮下？主席唔該，咁意見聽到有冇補充？係我補充一下咧，就係互助幼兒中心咧就非資助嘅，係嗰啲團體自己咧，佢係誒自負盈虧，我要揾一啲。

232
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:50,640
義工佢哋自己合合作嘅噉，所以咧就誒，其實可以諗嘅。不過就唔係政府資助嘅。我想補充啲點嚇好誒，跟住我哋誒，我聽佢講到名未誒，次在有潘少平議員咧揾誒揾少揾家誒，少家章議員啦，同埋張超雄議員添嘅嚇就潘少潘少平議員五分鐘啊，多謝主席。

233
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:19,800
就嗱，我主要想有幾個問題都想喺呢個會即係跟進一下嘅。咁正話都有提到咧，就政務司長咧就整咗個跨部門嘅督導委員會啦。噉就亦都有提到嗰五億咧，而家你哋就話會喺嗰個誒扶貧下低嗰個委員會嗰個社羣小組。

234
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,960
啊！

235
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,190
盤山，把梅隴青山。

236
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,970
咁呢個數字咧，係跟過去嗰幾年嘅數字都係相若啦。

237
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:11,880
設嘅一啲專設嘅課程咧，其實咧就係嗰個誒畢業嘅人數咧係三百一十二人嘅。

238
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:22,010
少時間，我哋準備噉樣啦。咁誒，至於關於頭先誒在培訓局嗰個問題，我就想想交畀誒同事回答。邊位負責？

239
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:06,190
馬歐嘅課程，咁完成咗呢啲課程之後咧，誒在培訓局咧，我哋會為呢啲誒畢業嘅學員咧提供六個月嘅誒就業嘅跟進服務。

240
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:33,920
即係換句話講咧，其實我哋都係有一啲預留一啲嘅學額畀啊少數族裔嘅人士去入讀，咁但係好可惜咧，即係嚟報讀即係申請報讀嘅課程嘅啊少數族裔嘅人士咧就唔係咁多嘅。

241
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:44,700
係誒，剛才阿潘議員所問嘅問題咧，或者我即係回應一下啦。就誒，過去咧，我哋係每一年咧都係有撥一啲嘅再培訓嘅學額咧，就畀一啲誒誒。

242
01:01:53,770 --> 01:02:13,780
誒再培訓局就響一八至一九年咧，都預咗八百個學額，就其中咧有八項咧係全日制課程嘅，有二十四項係半日制嘅。噉我主要想問咧，過往都有呢啲小組組合嘅課程，我印象中噉就佢哋呢啲婦女嗰個報讀個情況係點樣？

243
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:33,790
同埋嗰個，尤其是全日制課程，應該有就業跟進㗎嘛，同埋同就業掛鈎嘅。噉佢哋嗰個就業個情況又點樣？咁同埋咧，就佢主要係啲咩職位同埋職業？咁當然你二十一段都有提到咧，就即係都會協助呢個誒小區族類嘅婦女咧，希望透過培訓咧做嗰個。

244
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:53,800
誒健康護理業噉，所以喺一八一九年度咧，你哋都會做嗰個課程嗰個教材咧。噉我主要又想問咧，因為最近都有朋友提到咧，其實就誒而家護理業咧又話要輸入外勞又成，噉就你哋嗰個構思係點？因為咧嗰個牽涉到咧就嗰個行內裡面嗰個工資待遇。

245
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:13,810
福利條件等等嘅噉，將來呢一類噉嘅個課程，如果真係同就業掛鈎咧，其實喺呢一方面係咪已經傾咗佢哋嗰個誒將來，倘係真係呢啲少數嘅婦女讀完呢啲課程，進入呢個行業，佢哋嘅福利條件係已經即係有一個即係同呢啲僱主有一個確認。

246
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:33,820
同埋係咪？因為而家本地嘅婦女啊，都唔願意做，就係因為福利條件即係差異得太大。所以講咧，就呢一方面，一人唔改善咧，其實做呢啲課程咧，可能都影響呢啲婦女嘅就業。咁呢一方面，我想了解下，即係政府喺呢方面有冇咩一啲跟進嘅安排咧？唔該。係係，毛女士作答。係。

247
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:54,010
係誒誒，多謝潘議員同埋誒多謝主席嘅。咁首先或者誒，我回答咗誒。譬如頭先就住呢一個誒司長將會即係誒誒，佢佢主持嗰一個督導委員會嘅工作啦。咁其實誒如誒，基本上咧就係誒司長就係會主持一個跨局嘅督導委員會嘅。咁誒一

248
01:03:54,010 --> 01:04:14,020
因為就係就住誒一八至一九年度嘅財政預算案入邊咧，都誒提提出咗，我哋希望就住加強少數族裔人士嘅工作方面咧，就誒額外咧留咗五億元去到做。咁呢個督導委員會咧就會去到誒傾呢五億元點樣用啦。咁誒亦都會主要就係要講翻咧誒唔同嘅政策局資。

249
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:34,030
間嗰個分工啦，嗰個協調啦，係點樣咁？但係誒呢呢啲錢點樣用咧？其實我哋亦都好即係話誒，好希望因為想聽到誒少數族裔朋友嘅意見噉，所以誒頭先你所提到嘅，其實誒扶貧委員會下邊嘅誒特別需要誒呢一個誒嗰個誒誒工作小組咧，其實就係我哋誒。

250
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:54,040
而家就幫阿司長去做一啲誒籌備嘅功夫，咁所以剛剛喺五月底同埋誒琴日咧，就呢一個專責小組咧就開咗誒幫手舉辦咗兩場嘅即係誒焦點小組嘅委員會誒嘅會議，噉我哋就去聽咗呢啲意見，咁而呢一個誒即係誒特別需要專責誒特別需要社羣專責小組咧。

251
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:14,050
咧就會將聽到嘅會議嘅嘅意見咧，喺會議上面聽到嘅意見咧，會整合咗有一啲即係誒唔同嘅朋友嘅建議啦，或者譬如我哋聽到有好多人關於誒傳譯方面嘅服務嘅需要，覺得可以改善啊。關於誒勞工就業嘅一啲協助方面可以有改善啊。噉我哋會先整合咗嘅，因為都啱啱其實琴日先開完第二場嘅會。

252
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:34,060
咁所以，我哋整合咗之後咧，會誒提交翻畀司長。噉佢會誒，佢自己司長本身做嘅跨局嘅督導委員會咧，就會盡快咧就住嗰啲意見咧，就去即係開會討論。噉就誒司長會同有關嘅即係誒局長啦，會傾翻呢呢啲錢其實點樣安排去到分配係最好嘅。咁嗰個公誒嗰個討論嘅誒公。

253
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:54,070
夫咧，其實就誒而家係準備緊噉樣。有冇時間表㗎？會。噉我哋希望即係盡快咧。其實司長都心急嘅，因為佢都覺得即係誒都誒，好似你頭先講，我哋都聽過即係聽咗意見啊噉樣。咁亦都即係誒知道誒少數族裔嘅朋友好希望可以快啲即係見到個誒一個一個結果出嚟啦。噉我哋都希望可以快啲去做。咁誒不過當然啦。

254
01:05:54,070 --> 01:06:14,080
啲五億元咧，其實誒，我哋都知道誒，即係可能係一個初步嘅開展啦。咁誒，會係點樣嘅形式？即係譬如話有一啲有一啲朋友同我哋講話，可能會係誒透過一啲即係誒誒非誒政府機構去到做一啲服務啊，定係即係部門之間去加強個服務啊。其實唔同嘅形式咧，我哋都要探討。咁所以誒，我哋希望盡快，但係都誒畀少。

255
01:06:45,130 --> 01:07:05,140
e.m.誒嘅人士去到去入讀啦。咁誒就雖然我哋係有八百個學額啦，咁但係睇翻誒去年二零一七一八年度咧，其實入讀誒依啲為誒即係誒少數族裔嘅人士而。

256
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:54,540
咁誒啲課程裏邊嚟講咧，其實咧就有分兩部分咧。正如阿潘議員所講，有一啲咧就係誒全日制嘅就業掛鈎嘅課程。咁喺去年嚟講咧，我哋都有七十位嘅誒少數族裔嘅人士咧，就完成咗各類唔同嘅誒依啲就業掛。

257
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,100
好啦，講翻個問題咧，正話咧就。

258
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,690
跟住嚟請阿邵家俊議員計。誒，多謝主席。

259
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:03,360
開始食嘢噉樣樣嚇，咁呢啲日期咧，呢啲時間我哋自己唔掌握到咧，其實誒。

260
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:27,300
具體解決到一啲眼前嘅問題，咁呢個我稍後係可以再討論啦。咁咧就誒。

261
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:24,680
設嗰啲嘅課程咧，嗰個就業率咧，我哋係逾百分之五十噉，係即係每年我哋都係相約可以達到依一個嘅數字。

262
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:56,930
嘅嘅嘅人咧，今日咧係誒齋戒期啦，噉樣嚇。即係話補充啊，七點幾先會再開翻個開著咩個？

263
01:09:49,150 --> 01:10:00,440
誒，我都要多謝今日出席嘅團體啦嚇，特別係社聯咧，每一次嚟到咧都畀得啲好具體嘅一啲出路同埋建議嚇，因為呢個係好好好好需要嘅。

264
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:22,210
咁呢個啊就業跟進服務咧，我哋主要都係會幫佢去啊搜尋有啲乜嘢適合佢哋嘅職位啦。噉啊啊聯絡僱主啊啊，即係啊介紹佢哋去誒面試啊見工啊噉樣樣嘅。

265
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:39,470
嘅示範嗱，咁呢個我哋，我我哋我好希望係稍後我哋攞到嗰個時間表咧，我哋大家可以或者請教到一啲Ango嘅同事，可以知道話邊啲日子我哋要特別留意嘅話，呢個噉啊係一個好重要、好重要嘅示範作用。

266
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:55,760
噉啊，睇翻即係去年嗰個嘅啊就業嘅率啦，或者再睇翻做一兩年嘅就業率咧，啊少數族裔人士誒嗰啲讀完呢啲全日制嘅就業掛鈎嘅課程咧，佢哋嗰個就業。

267
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:39,000
咁但係至於佢哋嗰啲嘅服務條件咧，就變咗就係要誒申請人咧就同個僱主誒雙方面佢哋達到啦，就我哋就冇話誒要求，即係僱主係一定要誒提供一啲乜嘢嘅服務嘅條件嘅。

268
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:16,050
率咧係約摸係五百分之五十，即係五十個percent到係一半到嘅。咁呢個都係我哋一個預期嘅嗰個嘅水平嚟嘅啊。咁因為我哋係一般人士咧嗰個啊就業率咧，我哋係預期係百分之七十噉，而啊為少數族裔人士。

269
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:45,180
咁除咗呢啲就業掛號課程，我哋當然仲有好多一啲半日制嘅，同埋晚間誒嘅課程，就係有關語文啊，或者係啲嘅技能嘅培訓嘅課程咧。我哋都係有誒提供畀誒少數族裔嘅人士去到誒攻讀嘅。噉啊，主席，或者我補充係咁多先。好，唔該，彭生。

270
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:20,730
咁咧就另一方面咧，我都想補充咧，就就就就住嗰五億咧。其實我諗，我哋即係我作為一個小小成員咧，我哋一定有期望嘅。咁由C S L去主領咧，即係話又有權又有錢咧。我希望呢五億咧真係能夠解決到一啲即係問題嘅，唔係淨係即係我知道有限呢個呢個錢係有限，但係都其實都係應該可以。

271
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:47,960
誒，正話揾少根，議員咧就話要誒三省吾身啦。噉我覺得，我哋除咗係誒旁聽嘅朋友可以有即可以有即場翻譯服務之外咧，其實正話嗰個尷尬咧係誒好好值得我哋深刻去反思一下。即係正話嗰位朋友啊，就話誒穆斯林嘅。

272
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,190
嗯。

273
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:44,720
誒。

274
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,230
酒店方面嘅服務員啦。

275
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:48,780
彭生唔該你啊，係誒多謝主席噉啊，多謝啊邵議員嗰個問題咧，就誒。

276
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:39,370
咧培訓佢哋咧，係作為一啲院舍嘅工作去照顧自己嘅長者，推出相關嘅課程咧噉樣。唔該，主席。好，邊位回應？

277
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:35,540
少數族裔語言嘅教學助理能夠為佢哋提供一啲學習上嘅輔助咧，噉樣，即係第一點。第二點咧，就係講到嘅誒就業掛鈎嘅課程咧。

278
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:48,590
其實咧，我誒你講咗啦嚇，一般人係七成啦，EMA係五成啦。但係我想問咧，除咗係就業呢個係一個數字啦，我想問咧就係誒，佢哋通常揾到啲咩工作？

279
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:22,220
收窄啲嘅問題，係講緊咧係有冇一啲就教學助理咧係識得一啲小眾類嘅語言，能夠幫一啲英文冇咁好嘅能力，英文能力冇咁好嘅學員咧，能夠進入呢個課程裏邊咧？

280
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:20,560
誒都揾到係各類唔同嘅誒職位都有嘅。誒依度舉一啲嘅例子啦，就係做誒做美髮啦，做美容啦，做誒一啲誒做即係修甲啦，誒。

281
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:23,650
我哋又好明白，我自己點解冇掌握到嘅嚇。但係另一方面，呢個冇掌握到咧，其實又真係説明咗好多嘢嘅，即係連我哋呢個小組咧都冇掌握到。咁其實如果我哋掌握到嘅話，我哋開會嘅時間又對到呢啲時間嘅話咧，咁嗰件事就會係誒會係對咁對政府嚟講，對社會嚟講咧，都會係一個好大。

282
01:11:45,000 --> 01:12:05,010
再培訓局嘅嘅副總監咧，即係阿彭先生喺度啦。我有幾個問題想關於再培訓局嘅。第一個問題咧，就係過往幾年咧，再培訓局咧有幾多次咧喺個課堂上邊安排咗會講英文或者會講少數族類語言嘅教學助理，為嗰啲英語能力比較低嘅學員提供全日。

283
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:25,020
或者輔導服務咧，有冇數字咧？啊，你哋好多數字嘅嚇，咁咧就誒，即係話你講話好可惜啊，得五成誒，得佢哋誒參加率唔係好高啦噉樣。噉我就反過來問咧，就係噉，你哋誒再培訓局又係為咗佢為咗呢啲學員提供幾多次，即係呢啲有講英文或者講小眾語。

284
01:12:48,870 --> 01:13:08,880
佢哋嘅誒薪酬水平又如何？咁呢啲誒，我希望你唔會話幫我聽冇統計，所以我唔知道，我咪答唔到你啊。咁誒，我覺得在撥款局都冇呢啲統統計咧，就話你又有，但你有六個月嘅跟進服務咧，噉我就覺得好奇怪啊。如果係噉嘅話，誒，另外咧，我就有條橋咧，可。

285
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:28,890
以畀大家諗諗嘅嚇，咁咧就因為咧好多少數族裔嘅長者咧，基於經濟同埋家庭狀況啲問題咧，根本就係冇能力去入住一老人院嘅。咁而香港亦都未，已經冇一啲咧係畀少數族裔誒嘅專門老人院啦。咁而好多係好大部分少少數族裔婦女咧，都係照顧者嚟嘅。政府會唔會考慮？

286
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,540
啲社會服務嘅支援啦。

287
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,430
啊，跟住請張超紅議員嘅。

288
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,020
誒，亦都有做依個。

289
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:28,380
噉佢哋三十七萬人都係人啦。

290
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,900
呃， receptionist，呃。

291
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,720
其實佢嗰個身份咧，都可以話係一個雙重弱勢。

292
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:32,920
好，主席。誒，首先多謝咁多團體啦。呢個題目都大嘅，即係婦女。

293
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:24,610
嗯，社會服務咧，即係一啲恆常性嘅資助嘅服務咧，其實係冇嘅。

294
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:24,010
嗰個即係我哋嗰個每一類型嗰個工種，即係佢哋誒入職之後每一個工種嗰個就業嘅數字，因為都比較詳細嘅，咁所以我諗啊會後先補充。多謝黃生嚇，好。

295
01:13:49,100 --> 01:14:09,110
有關嗰個即係誒語文方面啊，嗰啲咧，其實咧，我哋所有為依啲小數族裔人士專設嘅課程咧，其實我哋係用英語去到教授嘅。咁所以咧，即係嗰嗰啲嘅課程，自己本身咧，建議係用誒英語去到去授課嘅。主席，我想澄清，我想。

296
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:42,830
知道誒，依方面咧就誒，我而家暫時手頭上面未有嗰個統計嘅數字，噉我翻去要即係問翻我哋培訓機構咧，有幾多個依啲case，即係個案係請過嘅時候咧，誒，我先再補充翻。因為我咪同我都明白，E.M.唔等於英文好㗎嘛。

297
01:14:43,470 --> 01:15:03,480
係咪英文？誒，E.M.唔等於講到英文㗎嘛？係咪？我哋今日都有都有職場嘅翻譯啦。嚇，唔該，主席係噉。至於第二個問題，關於係誒嗰個就業嗰個情況啦。咁誒嗰啲讀完呢個就業掛屋課程嗰啲誒少數族裔人士咧，佢哋畢業咗之後咧。

298
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:50,460
就接待係啦，接待員啦，誒或者係旅遊嘅一啲。先生可唔可以補充到啲數字啊？即係我知道而家好種類，而家好多種啦，但係數字上係點樣樣咧？同埋佢哋嘅薪酬嘅待遇係點樣樣啦？可唔可以補充？可唔可以試下補充啲數字畀我哋啊？或者會後補充啦。如果暫時未有啲數字嘅話，誒手頭數字就都有些少。

299
01:15:50,460 --> 01:16:10,470
嘅就嗰個係嗰個就業嘅數字，我哋誒就有噉。至於佢嘅薪酬待遇咧，就誒依個我哋就要再要問翻先，就會知道。唔緊要，你會後補充啦。如果有嘅話，你可以而家簡介下。乜要咁簡介？如果你唔方便講嘅話，暫時未有數字嘅話，會後補充。係咁誒就。

300
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:53,330
少數族裔，誒，佢哋個貧窮嘅情況，誒，同埋揾工。我哋即係首先都要明白，誒，本身婦女都係喺個社會上面咧，誒，佢哋都會誒有好多地方係相對弱勢啦。噉，然後再加埋呢個少數族裔咧。

301
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:18,010
我哋見到誒喺香港咧，就有好多少數族裔婦女三十七萬嘅外傭啦。咁呢一班嘅少數族裔嘅婦女咧，其實就都相當被忽視。雖然雖然我哋有三十七萬嘅呢啲嘅外籍家務工，但係對於佢哋嘅。

302
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:48,670
誒都係喺即係一般人底誒，即係無論佢係個健康啊、情緒啊、誒工作上面嘅一啲嘅遇到嘅困難啊等等咧，其實誒我哋見唔到有任何即係社會福利方面嘅嘅支援，或者唔係福利啦，即係誒係一。

303
01:17:50,820 --> 01:18:10,830
咁其實平機會都有提到呢一點嘅。誒就住呢樣嘢咧，我都想問下誒，譬如話平機會提到咧，佢哋如果誒遇到一啲譬如不公平解僱啊，佢哋誒或者可能懷孕啊，誒或者係喺一個佢。

304
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:30,840
停止咗工作期間咧，佢哋就唔能夠接受任何呢個受資助嘅醫療服務啊。咁呢一點都造成相當困難。如果當時佢懷孕或者係誒患病咧，咁呢個都係令到佢相相當困難啦。我唔知政府喺呢方面咧會唔會誒有一啲嘅。

305
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,120
重新嘅考慮啦，另外就係嗰個。

306
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:38,230
即係誒，去到進行呢個即係誒受訓嗰個情況咧。

307
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:16,420
令到我哋咧可以將對個問題咧係進一步瞭解同埋分析，同埋知道即係我哋處理方面可以點樣改善。

308
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:49,230
誒家庭暴力咧，整體我哋理解咧，少數族裔嗰個家庭暴力嘅情況都嚴重嘅。誒有部分係可能係一啲文化價值嘅元素啦。

309
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:53,400
咁所以即係好多我哋同我哋合作嘅培訓機構咧，即係佢哋都覺得係誒較為難去到誒即係説服得到誒啲少數族裔嘅人士咧去參與我哋啲課程。

310
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:33,820
咁另外嗰個誒再培訓嗰度咧，我哋頭先都聽到啊，彭生所講個數字咧，我覺得都幾誒，即係有啲羅生門啊。一方面，我哋聽到團體咧都係不斷講緊啊，希望爭取多啲再培訓嘅機會。

311
01:18:49,510 --> 01:19:08,210
咁平機會亦都有提到呢點咧，就係佢喺二零一五年咧都曾經建議過咧，喺福利事務委員會咧就話，社處應該就住呢啲少數族裔裏邊發生嘅家庭暴力咧，係有系統咁去誒蒐集數據同埋去公佈呢啲數據。

312
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:52,970
份機構咧，亦都係誒分析過，噉就即係其實最主要咧，都係誒好多一啲啊少數族裔嘅人士咧，即係佢會覺得誒嚟呢個讀呢個再培訓嗰個課程嗰個時間誒，未必係適合佢哋啦。

313
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:54,110
噉就為咗少數族裔而提供嘅一啲再培訓嘅誒課程咧，好似不足。咁但係彭生咧就話誒，而家嗰啲課程嘅名額咧都用唔曬。咁其實個使用率都相當低添，你可以話即係八百個學額咧，最後得嗰三百零人畢到業。

314
01:19:54,110 --> 01:20:14,120
噉樣係咪咁多個名額用曬咧？都好明顯唔係。噉我都想誒，第一就聽下彭生，即係從誒E D B嗰個分析，究竟點解會有呢個問題咧？即係點解吸引唔到誒少數族裔嚟到去上？

315
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:34,130
上呢啲課程，佢哋遇到啲咩困難咧？我亦都想聽下團體有冇咩補充。好啊，主席，你彭生先同問。好啊，啊，多謝主席，噉啊，多謝啊張議員嗰個問題啦。其實我哋都有相，即係去了解過，即係個中個問題啦。噉我哋同我哋嘅一啲啊培。

316
01:20:53,250 --> 01:21:13,260
咁亦都係有一啲嚟講咧，就覺得即係讀完之後，佢哋亦都係咪誒咁容易可以揾得到誒適合嘅工作，係就到佢嘅時間啊，或者個收入係啱佢哋咧噉樣樣。咁誒就亦都有啲部分，我相信會係因為即係誒。

317
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:24,050
我就想問你，究竟錢就等喺度啦。

318
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:03,970
點解我哋呢啲香港永久居民、香港一份子？

319
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,930
我想請教下誒局方咧，就係。

320
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:04,630
就要加強支援少數族裔人士，亦都預留咗五億元。

321
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:19,820
喺貧窮線嘅當中，裏邊有女性嘅都已經成廿四萬幾，不二萬四二萬四。

322
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:59,420
你嗰個第二十五段嘅未來路向嗰度，就政府咧就希望喺一八一九。

323
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:50,450
喺現時嚟講，就菲律賓工人、印尼工人入口都已經大量嘅數字。

324
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:12,890
具體上，我哋點樣去協助咧？你可唔可以畀個答案？現時二十五萬、二十六萬，我哋係少數族裔。

325
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:59,670
印尼工人唔識廣東話嘅，都可以佢嘅嗰個誒agent咧，都可以令到佢哋講得好好好流利。

326
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:45,410
細班啲一對一嘅誒教授會唔會更加啱佢哋嘅需要咧？咁呢個就係我哋嘅建議。好嘅，誒時間關係，我哋請何君耀議員同埋。

327
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:42,660
問題亦都係有喺度啦。有工就冇人做，有人就冇工做。咁呢個匹配嗰個，似乎講咗成個幾鐘頭，我都聽唔到一個前路。噉我想請教你咁嗱，一陣你未答我之前咧，我又畀個答案啦。唔單止提出問題，我都試下畀個答案。

328
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:33,270
誒語言嘅問題啦，咁雖然我哋啊為呢啲少數啊族裔人士嗰啲嘅專設嘅課程咧，其實都係用英語授課，咁但係我相信有部分嘅呢啲啊少數族裔嘅人士咧，即係個英文嗰個嘅程度，亦都未必話真係咁好，係可以。

329
01:21:54,390 --> 01:22:14,400
係我可唔可以聽下啲團體有冇有冇邊位議會人士又回應關於剛才啊？啊，曾生唔該，即係嘉俊先生。誒，咁問翻我哋啲members咧，個時間方面咧，好難夾到咧，係啱嘅，因為誒喺好多少數族裔，其實佢哋本身而家已經有翻緊工作，而且好多都係啲睇。

330
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:34,410
啲勞動啊，長工時嘅工作收工嘅時間其實已經好攰㗎啦。所以誒，如果個時間上面配合唔到嘅話咧，佢哋係好誒好細動力噉，唔去讀呢課程。咁另外一個問題提到就係唔知道有啲咩相關匹配到嘅工作呢個部分誒，我認為誒E.R.B.誒建。

331
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:54,420
到呢個問題嘅時候，其實可以同老主去諗下，其實個背後係因為僱主對於E.R.B學咗嘅廣東話或者英語嘅認受性唔夠，而出咗呢個呢個噉嘅問題。因為佢佢哋見到張sheet嘅時候，佢都係問兩句：哦，我我唔可以當你係一個本地嘅廣東話。

332
01:22:54,420 --> 01:23:14,430
話嘅人，所以我就唔會聘請你嘅噉樣。所以誒中間咧誒，僱主嘅要求同埋E.R.B教出嚟嘅部分，其實係有啲唔接軌嘅部分嘅。所以誒呢度我誒即係我哋嘅經驗上面會見到啦。所以你話E.R.B佢自己嘅就業方面或者勞工處，其實會唔會可以幫到手去？

333
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:34,440
令到僱主知道呢一啲嘅課程真係可以幫到佢哋嘅誒僱員咧，噉樣噉。另外一個提議咧，其實我就係覺得誒需要考慮畀一啲誒誒資助一啲僱主，或者畀翻啲僱員咧去上翻呢啲噉嘅課程。依家啲你有學位，你有你有委證，但係。

334
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:54,450
其實好多小到做嘅，既然翻工翻得咁長嘅時候，倒不如建議僱主誒，你喺翻工嘅時間，可能每個禮拜抽幾個鐘頭，畀佢上中文班、英文班，喺工作時間入面增值。咁個僱員亦唔需要額外抽時間出嚟，而僱主真係見到啊，你做嘢嘅時候，你中文、英文水平有進。

335
01:23:54,450 --> 01:24:14,460
步喎，咁有進步嘅時候，其實公司到最後都獲利嘅喎。咁因為我哋最近都有幫個求職者去建工，佢翻工之前個老細都問：有冇啲中文班可以誒，即係幫下佢喺翻工之前準備。跟住我就話：如果報EIB要等，等可能唔知等一個月兩個月，佢畀唔到開班期，因為有啲。

336
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:34,470
一定要救人先畀到期，所以我哋以唯一可以揾到嘅resource就係睇下有冇volunteer去做噉。但係有誒合資格可能誒識教嘅誒volunteer其實都好少，又要識佢哋嘅家鄉語言，又要識英文，又要識中文。其實呢方面好睏難，所以嗰個開班上面會唔會開得再密啲啊？或者？

337
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:57,300
O.K.

338
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,400
係一人才。

339
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,490
我哋培訓佢做三種嘢啫。

340
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:31,830
課程又話唔啱，時間又唔就。我話畀你聽，其實大家都嬌生慣養。

341
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,980
若果佢係高學歷嘅，就揾匹配翻啲高嘅職業啦，冇問題啊！

342
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:55,700
喺嗰個我唔係話乜嘢啊，即係高學歷另外講。而家係真係係係洗碗，噉我就揾人去洗碗。

343
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:26,160
要要揾嘢做，我都要點都要逼自己要講講英文啦，係咪冇冇理由唔得嘅？但係點解我就話睇到個差異，我哋E A B整出嚟嗰啲咧？

344
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:21,460
佢年青人係點樣？年中年人係點樣？年老人係點樣？呢個分析。但係如果係一啲低學歷，又佢係中中年人士，佢又香港永久居民。

345
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:14,920
係睇一睇，何議員，我哋誒下一次個焦點討論係嗰五億元點樣使？其中個可能不過唔知。我明。不過唔知。即係我聽咗咁耐，我就直程將嗰嗰件事嘅主席撈埋一齊嚟去去研究。我哋想解決問題，唔係淨係討論嘅問題啊嘛？係咪？係，毛女士，你稍不迴應下。

346
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:41,750
我哋可唔可以揾下我哋啲外籍勞工嗰啲agency嚟訓練佢哋？我睇到佢哋可能訓練嗰啲印印容仲訓得好到位，但係我哋咧E.A.B啊諸如此類咧課程又唔啱，訓練出嚟又唔等使實報實即係實務啲做得唔得？就係話佢哋。

347
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:16,100
誒家庭傭工domestic servant就得domestic helpers part time full time冇問題。咁但係我哋要overcome一樣嘢就係誒呢班人佢係香港人，噉佢哋有最低工資嘅，噉我哋咪畀最低工資佢咯。咁所以我哋都係人盡其才，就唔好坐喺度講埋曬啲假大空嘅嘢。

348
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:36,110
理論多於實踐噉，我就話：如果唔做嘢，揾人哋去做印尼工人都可以訓訓練訓練到講廣東話，喇喇聲嘅。咁點解我哋呢啲完全做到好似做唔到嘢，一籌莫展咧？嗱，可唔可以解解決？就針對兩件事。你喺呢度兩兩萬幾人當中，你可唔可？

349
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,970
誒，勞工處都有嚇。

350
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:56,230
有冇有冇另外會議？冇冇進行。O.K.

351
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:37,850
好似冇嚟啊！嘛，咁即係咪定係誒呢個政府持有咯？係。

352
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:22,650
都會有一啲嘅減免嘅機制嘅，咁呢個我我就代表唔到我哋答，不過我諗我知道呢個資料啦，係唔該。

353
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:31,570
係靠呢啲民間嘅自發嘅資源嘅，噉我唔知政府喺呢方面即係係咪應該係勞福局啊？咁但係勞福局今日好似。

354
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:33,900
另外就係誒嗰個外籍家務工嗰個缺乏支援啦，同埋佢哋喺身份一齣現變化嘅時候，佢誒連基本嘅醫療服務都得唔到呢方面咧，我唔知政府會唔會有啲回應。

355
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:40,660
係，張儀冇補充。好誒，我估呢個係一個技術性㗎啦。我我係問緊個政策上咧，就住呢啲嘅外接家務工，我哋會唔會有一啲誒支援佢哋？即係喺譬如話佢哋出現嗰個誒。

356
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:56,120
可以抽調啲人去配合咗嗰個誒誒嗰啲嗰啲agency company訓練佢講廣東話，然後就去做domestic helper。然後我畀翻大概一萬蚊，guarantee佢個minimum pay咪搞掂咯。政府咪分嗰個即係嗰個中間嗰個gap咯，得唔得啊？噉樣。

357
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:35,210
係嘅，多謝何議員，多謝主席。咁誒誒，頭先正如我即係都講咗，或者係阿朱都講咗啦。其實下一次呢一個誒小組委員會都會講一講誒我哋嗰個專責小組嗰個誒功夫會係點樣嘅。咁誒個督導委員會個功夫會係點樣啦？咁嗰五億元即係我哋都會喺嗰個督導委員會嗰度傾。咁但係多謝何議員你頭先嘅意見，我都會帶翻。

358
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:55,220
佢嘅即係包括，譬如喺誒訓練我哋，即係或者培訓我哋誒，而家已經係香港嘅一啲少數熟語嘅人士，佢哋嗰個誒中文嗰個誒説話能力啊，各樣嘢嗰方面咧點樣去加強咧？其實你頭先嗰個我哋聽到，噉我都會帶翻翻去反映。主席，容我再補充下啦，温如誒，實際上佢哋個個都好聰明㗎。

359
01:28:55,350 --> 01:29:15,360
講廣東話個個都得嘅，但係而家嚟到呢一度咧，就成日講到就話佢語言有困難有有障礙。我我覺得呢個問題有多少係誒誇張咗？實際上佢哋講英文又得，廣東話又得，佢哋有語言天才。我哋去到英國讀書或者我哋去英國。

360
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:52,460
你要馬死落地行要逼㗎嘛？噉你睇下人哋印尼嗰啲過嚟嗰啲，咁點解可以做得到咧？點解我哋呢啲唔得咧？但係我哋仲要貼成五億幾元喺度。我話畀你聽，攞五千萬出嚟畀我哋啲噉嘅嗰啲誒嗰啲domestic helpers agents都可以搞掂，可以閒閒哋訓練到五百個都得啦，係咪？係。

361
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:16,540
誒，如果其他委員咧就進一步嘅提問嘅話咧，我哋係阿張思紅議員嚇，我諗或者三分鐘啦，好嘛？係，因為佢頭先未答曬啊。我另外兩個點咧，就係一就係關於誒社處有關家庭暴力咧，係咪可以有系統咁蒐集，即係就住少數族裔佢哋嘅情況啦？

362
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:55,610
好有冇補充？係啊，彭女士嚇，彭綺蓮女士。好多謝主席。咁誒，關於喺家暴嗰方面咧，就誒，我哋其實而家喺嗰個誒資料蒐集裏面咧，我哋都有分析誒，當中咧係有邊一啲少數族裔嘅人士咧牽涉在內嘅。咁其實我哋都有呢個資料嘅。

363
01:30:55,610 --> 01:31:15,620
咁至於咧，就係話家庭傭工，如果佢哋係外接家庭傭工，如果佢哋係即係誒唔再受僱之後嗰個醫療嘅問題咧，因為我諗我我又喺呢度答唔到。咁不過咧，我知道醫管局咧對於一啲咧就係如果係誒即係非誒我哋話誒認可個身份嘅人士咧，佢哋都。

364
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:44,850
啲嘅主流嘅服務咧，係去提供翻嘅嚇。

365
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:16,310
措施包括剛才有同誒同時關注嘅關於個五億元嘅支援係點樣用法嘅。希望下一次大家可以誒準時出席誒，多謝大家參與，多謝曬，多謝曬，政府代表。

366
01:31:41,090 --> 01:32:01,100
華人嘅情況，或者佢哋有其他嘅社會服務嘅需要，包括咗佢哋嘅情緒啊、誒或者誒其他嘅家庭關係啊呢啲嘅問題。咁而家咧，佢哋就冇任何嘅服務嘅，咁即係有啲N.

367
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:21,110
自己或者教會咧，就自己去主動提供，包括咗一啲嘅庇護嘅嘅場所啦，包括咗一啲情緒嘅支援服務啦，包括咗如果佢哋懷孕嘅時候，同埋懷孕之後嗰個誒小朋友個B B嗰個安排等等啦。咁呢啲嘅服務咧，而家全部都係。

368
01:32:41,320 --> 01:33:01,330
係，但係我講緊勞福局啊。但係誒，好啊，即係彭女士有冇跟林霞女士有冇咩補充？嚇唔該。係誒，多謝議員嘅提問。我諗咧喺嗰個服務層面咧，我哋其實咧就冇分彼此嘅，即係佢係誒。如果佢係已經係嚟咗香港咁誒，我哋其實喺我哋嘅綜閤家庭服務中心、保護家庭及兒童服務課。

369
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:21,340
等等咧，或者我哋甚至我哋嘅醫院裏面嘅醫務社工咧，其實都會有接觸到呢一啲誒需要求助嘅個案。噉我哋都有誒喺嗰個福利服務嗰方面咧，都係有支援嘅。譬如有一啲係懷咗孕，噉佢誒我哋都特別咧係誒會有一啲單張啊，會有一啲嘅接。

370
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:41,350
捉咧就係希望佢知道誒，即使佢懷咗人之後咧，佢想點樣處理咧？究竟佢想生個B B落嚟啦，定抑或生咗之後究竟點樣樣嘅安排咧？等等，我哋其實都有接觸嘅。咁誒，所以其實喺社會服務、福利服務嗰方面咧，就就我哋都係會用翻我哋一啲。

371
01:33:45,960 --> 01:34:05,970
誒冇其他問題嘅話咧，我哋誒誒時間都雖然係未到正式開會誒誒法庭嘅時間，但係我哋應該差唔多都討論咗誒個問題。我哋下一次嘅開會時間咧係七月十七號星期二上午十點四十五分嘅。我哋討論嘅焦點會係少數族裔督導委員會嘅工作同埋支援少數族裔人士嘅。
