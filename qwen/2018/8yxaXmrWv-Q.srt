On corruption, I hereby brief members on the ICACNL report 2017 tabled in the council today.

現在舉行立法會例行會議，發言石禮謙議員就香港特別行政區廉政公署二零一七年報向本會發言，石禮謙議員。

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:46,350
The number of pursuable complaints was two hundred one, two one two nine, an increase of seven per cent when compared to last year's figures.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:53,870
Since inception in 1974, the ICAC has been fighting corruption impartially and professionally with a holistic approach, combining law enforcement, prevention and education.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:12,170
alongside vigorous enforcement actions, the ICAC has put in place system and rules to eliminate corruption loopholes, as well as reaching out to the community to change the public's attitude from meek tolerance to rejection.

Taking timely intervention action in appropriate cases to frustrate possible corrupt and bid rigging activities at an early stage.

23
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:46,010
Of such early intervention, flat owners were made aware of the risks exposed in avoiding contracts, enabling them to take appropriate follow-up action at an early stage where necessary.

24
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:19,420
In order to maximise the effectiveness of the enforcement action, the ICAC implemented a two-pronged strategy consisting of the traditional approach of investigation with a view to prosecution.

25
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:31,520
amid global concern for corporate governance and business ethics in recent years, the ICAE assisted listed company to adopt a structured approach to corruption risk management through a three years ethics promotion programme.

under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).

35
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,590
但 let's not forget that people in many countries are still suffering because of corruption.

36
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,290
We will continue to render the wholehearted support to ICAC as always, President Assefa Meles.

Every recognition Hong Kong receive is a constant reminder to us of the importance of continued effort in fostering propriety culture.

40
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:37,390
不同 walks of life demonstrate zero tolerance on corruption, in stark contrast to the bad old days when Hong Kong was plagued by corruption.

41
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:32,840
On the integrity and probity of civil servants and public officers, the ICAC assisted the government departments and public bodies in enhancing internal control through improving their system, practices and procedures, with a view to plucking any loopholes.

42
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:52,850
That may give rise to corrupt practices, dereliction of duty and abuse of power. Last year, 63 assignment study were completed, and timely advice were provided on 490 occasions to government departments and public bodies. The ICA.

一conference on business ethics for listed company were held in September 2017. Moreover, a tailor-made anti-corruption guide and a new training package, which illustrate common ethical risks, were provided to listed company on all prospective listing.

44
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:23,700
香港有義務協助其他參與國在發展和實施反貪腐措施。在2017年5月，ICAC舉行了一場國際會議，與海外反貪腐機構分享知識。

45
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:53,580
ICAC also set up a small unit to provide training service to anti-corruption agencies in countries along the Belt and Road routes within the framework of UNCAC to help UNCAC signatories in their fight against corruption. We will not only enable Hong.

46
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:26,380
主席和各位議員，貿易是其中一項關鍵支柱，奠定香港的基礎。近年來，香港持續被國際評估為最清潔的城市之一。ICAC年度調查顯示，香港居民對環境的滿意度高於全球平均水平。

47
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:14,940
作為成員會委員會反貪腐，我理解ICAC會保持其承諾，於反貪腐戰線和維持香港競爭優勢，不管面臨的困難和挑戰。有此，我期望公眾成員。
