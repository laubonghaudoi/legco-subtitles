社會福利部門和公眾監察LSG撥款從價值 for money 觀點。

13
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:15,210
The indispensable role of NGOs in providing a wide range of services to meet the divergent need of different social strata in Hong Kong.

14
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:16,450
我有榮耀呈報我們的報告號碼69，，which contains our conclusions and recommendations on Chapter 1 of the Director's Audit Report Number 69 on administration of lump sum grants by the Social Welfare Department.

15
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:46,680
Starting from 2001, a lump sum grant, hereby known as LSG, subvention system, lump sum grant subvention system was rolled out with a view to allowing NGO management autonomy and flexibility in the deployment of subvention resources.

16
00:05:42,610 --> 00:06:02,620
在這章節，歐洲委員會已審查了一些NGO未遵守WSD發出的指引，包括LSG手冊及相關財務書面，以及績效成果和標準。

17
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,110
threshold。

18
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,330
however。

19
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,030
Accountability to the public.

20
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,330
One of the exemption criteria.

21
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,280
appropriate follow-up measures.

22
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,860
委員會表達關心，關於持續。

23
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:11,060
U.D. to take a more proactive role and be alert to NGO possible financial viability issues.

24
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:13,440
stipulated in the funding and service agreement, hereby known as FSA, signed between NGO and SWD.

25
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:22,680
SWD is urged to ensure that the provision of quality services would not be affected by the NGO LSG deficits.

26
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:29,190
The social welfare department only implemented these requirements from 2009 to 2010, a delay of some six years.

27
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:15,950
The guideline require a subvented body to review and disclose annually in a review report the remunerations of its top three tiers staff, unless it meets certain exemption criteria.

28
00:07:45,490 --> 00:08:00,860
In 2003, the Director of Administration issued a memorandum promulgating a set of guidelines for the control and monitoring of remuneration practices in supervisory bodies.

29
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:33,970
The committee expresses grave concern and dissatisfaction about SWD's failure to effectively monitor NGO service delivery, and strongly urged SWD to closely monitor NGOs with persistent underperformance and devise with them.

30
00:06:42,590 --> 00:07:02,600
lump sum grant operating deficits incurred by some NGO, the committee considers the persistent lump sum grant deficit coupled with the depleted LSG reserve of an NGO might serve as a reminder for SW.

31
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:43,420
委員會表達對社會福利部和勞工及福利局（SWD政策局）在實施披露要求方面的不足之處感到不滿，這些要求旨在提升NGO的透明度和。

32
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:49,480
The committee also expresses grave concern about the social welfare department' lax attitude and the serious delay in seeking clarification with the administration wing and the financial services and treasury bureau on the calculation of the 50% income threshold.

33
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,560
personnel in Hong Kong.

34
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,450

38
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,710
of the contribution made by members of the committee, particularly the lead member.

39
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:40,440
作為行政已經成立了一個專責小組，來審視增強累進補助金系統。

40
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:59,600
And offer advice to them in timely manner, taking into account actual circumstances of individual NGOs.

41
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:31,900
社會福利部門是強烈 urge，要 take 一個更 proactive 領 lead， to address the problem of staff turnover。

42
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:39,740
委員會考慮到，而家雖然重要，對於NGO嚟講，要遵守關於使用臨時撥款的指引。

43
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:51,010
SWD should enhance in communication with those NGO which have encountered genuine difficulties in apportioning process.

44
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:25,270
委員會表達關切，一些NGO未將辦公室開支分攤給非FSA活動。

45
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:54,490
The committee recommends the taskforce to take into consideration a host of issues, such as engaging different stakeholders, including frontline staff, in taking forward the review.

46
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:09,520
The report has touched upon issues relating to governance and management of NGO and and the management of conflicts of interest by the LSG Independent Complaints Handling Committee.

47
00:08:53,710 --> 00:09:12,740
SWD's calculation of the 50% income threshold deviated from the intent of the memorandum, which resulted in fewer NGOs required to disclose their senior staff imunimunurations.

48
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:20,950
Pointing out that people are the most valuable assets of NGOs in providing quality service, the committee expresses grave concern and dissatisfaction about social welfare's slow and inadequate actions to tackle the problem of high turnover of social work.

49
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,230
Mr. Lam。

50
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,280
