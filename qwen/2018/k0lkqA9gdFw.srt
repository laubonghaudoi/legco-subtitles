1

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:18,660
好，我介紹下誒今日政府嘅代表先，有財經事務及副務局嘅副秘書長黎志華先生。

12
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:27,510
And I would also like to remind all those present today that please observe all the security procedures, which a copy of which has been placed in front of you.

13
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:15,630
And in front of you, there are Nop with three channels. The zero channel is for the real, you know, live broadcast. Number one channel is the Cantonese version.

14

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:02:01,530
咁今日咧，直都有十幾個團體代表喺誒未誒發言之前咧，我哋可唔可以畀我讓我兩分鐘時間咧，係誒向各位講解下呢一個嘅誒發言嘅一啲嘅誒嘅規則。I think I I should just speak in English.

16
00:02:40,230 --> 00:03:00,240
And you can also submit, if you haven't done so, your written views on this bill. After you have finished your presentation, you can either leave it with our concierge here, or you can send it to our secretariat.

17
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,390
多謝主席。

18
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,640
好啦，啊！

19
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,300
嘅含混同埋。

20
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,090
誒咁當然係誒今日。

21
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,910
做緊專業人士去睇呢條條例。

22
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,840
呢一個税務修正條例最主要就係。

23
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,960
億億嗰啲交税嘅人，噉我相信誒。

24
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,420
資質嘅問題，咁當然係誒，我諗好多係。

25
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,950
發言嘅代表梁國雄先生，唔該你啊。

26
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,240
誒相撥係要政府去澄清。其實我睇咗就係。

27
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,130
私募基金唔使交税，即係話咧，其實我哋嗰啲有錢人只要去。

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,650
要知嘅嘢，大家都知道啦。噉就我而家請啊，第一位。

29
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,870
嗱，我哋立法即係立法會都有誒秘書處都有啲嘅意見嘅，其實佢係針對幾條嘅裏邊嘅定義。

30
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:55,930
呢一個誒條例草案嘅修訂，好多誒人嚟講啦。我諗我同佢講嘅方向就唔同嘅，因為我諗佢就係講好多誒。

31
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:54,840
其實香港已經係一個地税嘅天堂，股息税係唔使嘅，即係話誒，任何一間公司去派股息嘅收入係唔計落去交税嗰度。

32
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:42,280
我跟住講嘅誒，跟住我講嘅專業人士咧，就要講清楚，你點樣益我先，係咪益得夠先？我哋立法，你立法會秘書處就喂，你搞清楚嗱，我嘅講法就好簡單嘅。

33
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,720
廣泛。

34
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,490
即係唔使搞咁多嘢。

35
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,780
更加明確。

36
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,300
係嗰啲唔唔夠嘅嘢咧。

37
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,800
係會有啲人補翻畀佢，咁先有個循環。

38
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,010
噉我睇法就好簡單嘅，咁首先誒。

39
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,240
誒國際嘅金融中心，或者老一代嘅中心咧，嗰啲錢一定走嚟嘅。

40
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,920
而家香港最大嘅問題係咩咧？就係南水北調，呢個係。

41
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,350
玩嗰個遊戲咧，其實已經避税避到阿媽都唔認得，即係話。

42
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,960
年尾啦，咁即係講休養生息。咁老子《道德經》都講過嘅。

43
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,700
以奉有餘，個意思就係話咧，天道一個循環咧。

44
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,140
佢就係話：天之道，損有餘而補不足；人之道，損不足。

45
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,870
其實社會都一樣，我哋講經濟嘅時候唔係淨係講揾錢，而係嗰啲財富點樣分配。

46
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,310
噉嘅意思係咩咧？就係話進一步係令到嗰啲唔能夠唔嚟嘅大陸資金。

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:16,210
可以避好多税，而家要解決嘅問題係咩咧？就要進一步去令到呢個税務嘅寬減咧，係更加。

48
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:14,720
北水南調係大陸嘅國策嚟嘅，即係無論如何，基於大陸嘅國策，要喺香港有一個最大嘅人民幣池，抑或係佢要香港成為一個。

49
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,340
可以。

50
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,610
繼續揾錢。

51
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,050
話around the world即係叫人哋。

52
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,580
都會益佢哋，佢哋唔係香港人。

53
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,000
舉一個例，阿林鄭月娥。

54
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,080
要嚟洗黑錢，或者係。

55
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,500
咁所以我就最我最反對就係。

56
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,780
變成一個更加獲得優惠嘅。

57
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,930
around the group叫人哋嚟投資，而係嗰啲嚟緊嘅。

58
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,580
股息税唔使交，私募基金唔使交，都唔都唔未夠。

59
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,220
繼續係我，因為我哋嘅貧富懸殊咧係世界第一嘅。

60
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,690
完全冇曬誠信，你仲做乜嘢嚟叫人哋投資？所以好簡單，你減税唔係。

61
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,320
佢都一個一一啲人嘅係嘛，就係一個啲即係比較冇咁冇咁多冇咁有錢嘅人係嘛，二頭手二百萬減一半税。

62
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,930
而家講咗呢樣嘢之後咧，就跟住就會繼續大量咁減税，係令到我再講一次，無論係因為貪污嘅原因。

63
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:09,440
因為大陸嘅國策要嚟嘅，佢而家個市值咁高，雖然間我係知道嗰啲市值有好多喺大陸嘅嗰啲錢，任佢講嘅啫。但係佢而家已經係香港嘅最主要嘅持份者，所有嘅減税。

64
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:30,860
你冇同我講話要揾第啲嘅外國嘅資金嚟，而家冇啊！因為有個鄭若華喺度，係一個secretary of justice，即係話咧，你搞一個誒呢一個仲裁中心嗰個仲裁中心嗰個阿頭係司長嚟嘅，原來係。

65
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,960
Text.

66
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,920
Okay.

67
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm here as a.

68
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,550
representative of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.

69
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,800
已經連續高居，即係呢個居高首位好耐。

70
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,800
I will speak in English. Yes, by all means, please.

71
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:58,120
香港美國商會嘅程廣先生，唔該你，程生。誒，hello。

72
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:16,020
while we have many discussions among our members on the subject of transfer pricing.

73
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:24,460
我 regret to inform you that today we cannot, on behalf of the MCM, to express any formal opinion.

74
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:35,430
係洗廁所、整冷氣、整電燈，嗰啲人嘅生活越嚟越差。咁林鄭月娥仲有咩方法係益佢哋，而唔係益佢個老細咧？

75
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:51,430
係咪你馬雲嚟又要減税啊？所以啊，主席，我唔係講緊嗰啲枝枝節節嘅嘢，我係要求政府開徵累進利得税，調節貧富懸殊。好得唔該你啊，梁國雄先生。誒，跟住咧誒，就係。

76
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:42,990
As a personal aside, you know, as a part of中聯law firm, we think it is a tremendous step forward for Hong Kong to implement these transhipping regulations consistent with world standard. Thank you.

77
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:25,630
我覺得政府有咁多錢，第一就係要將公共事業即係公營降低嗰個交易成本同埋普通人嗰個生活費用。第二就係要抽利累進利得税抽税，所有喺香港揾錢嘅人都係香港人夾埋畀佢嘅，無論。

78
00:09:47,200 --> 00:10:07,210
下一位係澳洲會計師公會嘅何耀波先生，唔該，你阿波，唔該。唔該曬，主席。噉我諗誒，亦都係同之前呢位講者一樣啦。噉我哋澳洲會計師公會暫時就未做一個submission。我今次主要嚟都係代表會員去聽下今次呢個法例話草案。

79
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:27,230
係係啲嘅嘅聲音係點咁？但係我諗即係Having said that，我哋都有誒一兩個比較即係誒point。我哋即係有啲會員都反映咗啦。咁其實就係第一就係關於誒五十AAF入邊誒涉及到嗰個domestic transaction嗰度啦。其實誒。

80
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:47,240
誒，我哋有會員嘅意見就係希望可以見到咧，domestic to domestic嘅transaction咧可以有豁免from個T.P.，但係而家五十A.A.F.裏邊應該誒係係冇涉即係涉及到嘅。咁當然即係我哋會要考慮翻，就話當嗰個transaction係冇冇任何嘅一個overflow嘅。

81
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,090
therefore, we do not support the proposed amendment.

82
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,590
This proposed extension of scope is of concern to the profession.

83
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,420
and hence cannot meet the residency requirement under the tax treaty.

84
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:18,220
Certain aspect of the bill go beyond what the institute would have expected to see in this legislation.

85
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:34,980
喺佢哋去做個A.P.A.考慮嘅時候咧，佢哋都會誒我take into account呢樣嘢咯。咁第三咧誒，其實就

86
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:44,980
嚟提咗少少今日即係呢呢個議案嘅，就係關於誒，即係我哋當年澳洲會計師公會誒有好有嘅誒。

87
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:30,490
firstly， the extension of transfer pricing rules to salaries tax and property tax seems to exceed what is needed to meet the B， the the BAPs minimum requirements.

88
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:10,480
while the institute supports in principle and appreciate the efforts of the government in codifying the transfer pricing rules in the Hong Kong tax legislation, so as to meet relevant OECD requirements.

89
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:56,750
地主處嗰度嘅，係唔該曬。好，唔該。好，唔該。啊，下一位啊，香港會計師公會嘅蘇國基先生，蘇先生唔該你嚇。Okay，啊，Good afternoon，thank you for inviting the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants to address the committee.

90
00:11:45,260 --> 00:12:01,350
誒遠見就係想希望咧，盡快見到香港同澳洲簽訂個D T A。咁正正因為有呢個噉嘅T P regulation咧，其實我哋都希望見到咧嗰個D T A盡快可以即係誒香港同澳洲中間嗰個D T A咧，盡快可以落實咯。

91
00:10:48,430 --> 00:11:06,180
benefit或者係fantage或者個effect嘅時候，咁呢樣嘢可唔可以有個闊面啊？嚇，咁第二樣嘢咧就係關於嗯個APA regime嗰度advanced pricing agreement，咁其實嗰度就希望可以見到咧，而家暫時嗰個草案就係講緊誒一啲誒。

92
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:26,470
誒按時收費啦。噉我呢邊有我哋比較，譬如我哋工會咧入邊都有啲細嘅會員。咁如果有需要到，即係佢哋都比較cost sensitive㗎咁去做budgeting嘅時候，如果係可以有一個誒比較即係實在嘅價錢，譬如一個fixed fee嘅嘅嘅arrangement咧，會唔會可以考慮咧？咁呢樣嘢變咗係。

93
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:21,810
噉我嘅意見就係好唔得啊。誒，我知識到咧有一啲團體誒，即係可能未有夠時間去做written submission，但係如果你哋係有written submission嘅時候咧，我我諗我我哋即係誒秘書處亦都可能誒個別通知你哋，確其實可以喺呢個會之後嘅，直至二十。

94
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:41,820
三號到你都可以啊寄畀我哋嘅啊呢個雖然我哋冇正正式式喺呢一個嘅我哋嘅網上即係做過呢一個通知，但係咧我喺呢度正式同你哋講咧，你哋可以喺二十三號之前咧都可以將你哋嘅誒written submission咧係拎上嚟啊呢一個立法會。

95
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:56,580
The proposed amendment to Section 81A, Paragraph C, in relation to salaries tax, again does not relate directly to the BAPs requirements. It could lead to double taxation for certain taxpayers who hold Hong Kong employment but are required to work substantially outside Hong Kong on a recurring basis.

96
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:26,230
likewise, we question the amendment to section 16, 1 paragraph C. The amendment may result in some financial institutions with substantial operations in Hong Kong in the form of branches being unable to claim foreign taxes paid as deductible expenses. Hence, we do not.

97
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,150
在其他 jurisdictions。

98
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,460
不支持這項擬議的修訂。

99
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,440
It is common for different thresholds to apply.

100
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,250
Transfer pricing documentation requirement would apply.

101
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,040
In relation to related party transactions between domestic entities.

102
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,260
它authorises the ILD to make transfer pricing adjustments on taxpayers.

103
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Likewise, where certain business size and transaction thresholds are exceeded.

104
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,210
We also note that the threshold for preparation of the master file and local file is set at the same level.

105
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,410
for the transfer pricing documentation requirement, which could be onerous and yet unproductive.

106
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:37,350
The new transfer pricing rule number one could bring uncertainty to Hong Kong's territorial source principle of taxation.

107
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:37,400
In addition, we also noted that transfer pricing rule number one will apply to both domestic and cross-border related party transactions.

108
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:11,550
It is worth noting that if the interface between the source principle and the transfer pricing rules is not made clear, this could cause significant uncertainty to the Hong Kong tax system.

109
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:57,610
however，it is not clear if the I.R.D. can impose tax on taxpayers if the adjustments are made to attribute offshore profit to incidental or antecedent activities in Hong Kong.

110
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:27,240
to this end, we consider that further amendments should be made to the bill to spell out more clearly that the I.L.D. will not impose tax on the transfer pricing adjustments made in relation to offshore profits.

111
00:15:47,640 --> 00:16:03,290
It is worth noting that the primary purpose of implementing BAFS Action Number Thirteen is to prevent enterprises from exploiting tax rate differentials to obtain tax benefit in cross-border related-party transaction.

112
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:28,330
在 vast majority of cases， it is unlikely that any Hong Kong tax advantage can be gained. Therefore， we have reservations about applying the transfer pricing rule to domestic related party transactions， and we do not support the inclusion of domestic related party transactions.

113
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,600
嗯。

114
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,690
嗯。

115
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,590
could create uncertainty.

116
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,370
Therefore, section 15 cap F.

117
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,910
我好，我想感謝你，for the opportunity to to present today.

118
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,200
We consider transfer pricing rule number one would give the ILD sufficient power to make tax adjustments.

119
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:42,910
我便想聚焦我嘅注意，就係十五F，謝謝KK，為為提出呢個。

120
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:07,850
British Chamber of Commerce has not put in a formal written submission in terms of the bill. We just want to make some comments, you know, here today.

121
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:33,550
政府要考慮，如果他們必須進行國內交易和轉移定價，你考慮適用集團減税，以確保沒有經濟雙重課税在香港。

122
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:41,960
And I think that's important in terms of Hong Kong's overall competitiveness on the international stage, and and and being part of the global community, and also to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international global financial services centre.

123
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:18,780
With the introduction of transfer pricing rule number one, we also questioned the need for the proposed new section 15 cap F, which deals with certain activities carried out in Hong Kong in relation to intellectual property rights.

124
00:16:47,720 --> 00:17:03,200
We suggest raising raising the threshold for preparing a master file, so as to reduce the administrative burden on all relevant parties. In addition, we suggest taxpayers be given more time for preparing the file.

125
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:27,000
overall，我會like to commend the the government and the administration for a positive step forward for Hong Kong. you know we believe that it's important that Hong Kong does meet the minimum standards as as is required under the Beps inclusive framework and and this bill goes a significant way to achieving that.

126
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:51,080
Given the time constraint, I would like to stop here. More details of the institute's views on the bill can be found in our written submission that would follow. Thank you. Ah, thank you, Mr. So. Next we have Mr. James Bedana from the British Chamber of Commerce. Thank you. Thank you. First of all.

127
00:18:42,400 --> 00:19:02,410
that being said, there are some aspects of the bill which which we think need to be or would be great if if they could be reviewed and considered. I won't focus on the transfer pricing aspects of of that, as I'll leave that to others. And I think those points have already been well made.

128
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:22,420
In relation, just one point in relation to transfer pricing on domestic transactions, you know, we understand that that is the norm across multiple jurisdictions. However, in jurisdictions where domestic transfer pricing does apply, generally there is group relief and generally there is you know consolidated tax returns, and hence we would also ask.

129
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,060
嗯。

130
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,280
呢section可以。

131
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,900
我 stop there. But thank you very much for your time.

132
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,840
誒，我哋首先代表特區公業會計師公會香港分會誒。

133
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,610
誒主席，誒在座各位官員，在座嘅議員，誒下午好。

134
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,370
We also think there's some some drafting issues with Section 15F. So to the extent that the government

135
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,390
它係contrary and goes over and above the international norms regarding the taxation of intellectual property.

136
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,010
考慮得更密切，從一個 drafting perspective， to to to address some of the perceived weaknesses of that section。

137
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:17,080
And finally, we also think it's inconsistent with Hong Kong's stated goal of becoming an R and D and innovation hub.

138
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:59,010
啊，thank you。嗯，下一位係特許公認會計師公會香港分會嘅黃宏泰先生。阿黃生，唔該你。

139
00:20:53,030 --> 00:21:02,820
Our concerns around Section 15F primarily relate to the fact that we think that it will create economic double taxation in unintended circumstances.

140
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:37,630
does insist in terms of the application of section 15F, we would like some clarity and some clarification around drafting to ensure that section 15F1 doesn't create double taxation.

141
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:51,550
二、that it's linked and connected with the transfer pricing rules and the introduction of transfer pricing rules in Hong Kong， and three that that it respects the source principles as enshrined by case law in Hong Kong and and section 14。

142
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:17,620
introducing the concept of DMP or development enhancement maintenance protection and exploitation of IP is sufficient to to cover any mischief that that that section 15F is seeking to to cover.

143
00:19:43,580 --> 00:20:03,590
Section 15F, in in our view, the rationale for Section 15F is not clear, and to some extent we believe that Section 15F is redundant, in terms of the fact that the ordinary transfer pricing principles and the implementation of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, in

144
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,420
叫做咩啊？

145
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,860
本地嘅。

146
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,220
上上。

147
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,070
關關乎一個。

148
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,520
噉就五點裏邊咧，有一點係關乎係嗰個誒。

149
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,530
咁至於嗰個轉印定價咧，頭先有兩位發言者都講過嗰個誒誒。

150
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:16,370
多謝草案委員會畀呢個機會，我哋喺上嚟同大家講講對呢個草案裏邊嘅一啲意見。

151
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,180
雙重課税安排嗰個處理問題，噉就主要係五十A A嗰個處理問題。

152
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,690
交易咁呢個本地交易嘅話咧，我諗我覺得係有兩個大嘅原則係違背咗嘅。第一個就係香港嗰個。

153
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:06,760
嗰個侷限啦，即即唔係侷限嘅嗰個嗰個，即係嗰個誒包含咧，定係包括咗係一啲所謂誒。

154
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:10,960
咁對於嗰個雙重課税個安排之下個處理咧，就係主要喺五十A裏邊嗰個規限，咁規限咗咧就需要喺。

155
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:53,120
課税安排冇課税安排都好啦，都有公平處理方法嘅。咁呢個主要針對係八一A、C同埋十六一裏邊個個處理方法嚟。

156
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:43,560
税務安排嘅原則裏邊嘅處理方法嚟嘅，噉我哋嘅建議裏邊咧就希望係取消咗規限，達到一個相誒一個比較公平啲嘅處理方法。誒，無論係有。

157
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:29,940
個書面陳述咧，我哋就會喺廿三號之前咧，就會係寄上月誒誒組方案議會嘅啦。咁喺我哋個討論裏邊咧，我哋有八點，咁但係今日為咗時間方便咧，我哋着重係有五點，我想大家講講嘅。

158
00:22:47,460 --> 00:23:01,710
另外有三個咧，就係嗰個誒transfer pricing，即係轉讓定價嗰個安排啦。另外一個就我都唔知點樣classify咧，應該十五F個問題，嗰個就係應該係一個誒dimin provisions rather than一個transfer pricing嘅issue嚟嘅。

159
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:37,370
所以，所以，所以，因此，我們會要求，that that that the government consider section fifteen F very carefully to see whether or not you know it's it's it's first of all necessary in the context of the broader legislation and secondly whether or not if if that is the case whether

160
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:31,740
有雙重課税安排下嘅處理，同埋冇雙重課税安排下嘅處理咧，係有兩個規兩個分別嘅。咁喺個安排之下咧，就誒，我哋覺得係依個新嘅規限之下咧，就產生一啲不公平嘅處理方法，亦都不符合嗰個經合組織所推出一啲。

161
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,590
咁第四點咧就係誒，第四點咧就講嗰個。

162
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,220
咁喺依個包含裏邊咧，係亦都可能產生一啲。

163
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,290
誒之後嘅submission咧，應該會有一個詳細啲嘅討論嘅。誒，多謝主席。

164
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,680
最後一點咧，就係關乎轉讓地價嗰個誒嗰個。

165
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:53,750
未能預見到嘅，亦都可能不需要誒誒有噉嘅誒誒後果嘅。

166
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,470
頭先講十五誒十五F個問題啦，咁頭先有兩位同事提到十五F個問題，噉我覺得依個十五F嗰個係需要。

167
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,740
簡單税制，呢個令香港税制複雜咗嘅。另一方面咧，係喺個税收上方，税税收上邊咧，係影響。

168
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:02,340
嘅税務後果啦，咁呢個亦都係有為我頭先講嗰個原則，就係香港一個簡單税制嘅原則嚟嘅。噉嘅第三點。

169
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:32,360
誒政府嘅收入咧，其實冇嘅，亦都產生咗好多嘅不方便嘅或者不需要嘅納税人嘅嘅合規嘅程序。

170
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:41,640
咁另外一方面咧，另外一個係嗰個轉讓定價裏邊第二點咧，就係關乎佢而家包含咗係理得誒物業税、理得税同埋新豐税。

171
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:25,280
如果需要嘅話咧，係可以有一個比較誒詳細啲嘅諮詢，因為裏邊嘅規條，頭先有有同事有朋友提到，就係嗰個規條裏邊咧有啲地方唔清晰嘅。

172
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:18,120
嗰個總總檔案總誒總文檔咁嗰個時效上高，而家畀嘅時間咧係喺嗰個年度完咗之後六個月之內咧要準備好嘅。咁即係話喺五十八C嘅第二條裏邊規規限咗一樣嘢。

173
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:57,070
咁喺呢度方面方面嘅話咧，我哋希望係而家嘅草案裏邊咧係誒將佢攞走咗先。如果喺嗰個政府角度係需要去研究推出嘅話咧，係應該一個比較詳細啲、詳細啲嘅資訊嘅嚇。咁呢個第四點嚟嘅。

174
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:41,730
亦都喺度裏邊咧，亦都係誒。如果要處理係嗰個誒主張定價問題嘅話咧，現時嗰個草案條例入邊嘅五十A A F已經處理到㗎啦，亦都唔需要特別有條特別有條十五A F去處理一啲誒關於知識產權嗰個主張定價問題。

175
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:38,410
咁某個程度嚟講咧，喺呢個六個月時間裏邊咧，畀納税人去去準備個檔啊文檔嘅話，其實係未必足夠嘅，亦都係同嗰個報税嗰個期限咧係不一致，因為報税期限嘅話咧，以十二月做連結嗰啲公司嚟講咧，佢哋報税期限咧應該係八月中嘅，咁但係如

176
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:58,420
要根據而家條例裏邊講，裏邊咧就係應該係六月已經要有嗰個文檔㗎啦，噉係不一致嘅。噉我諗喺依個規條裏邊咧，應該考慮下睇下可唔可以令到喺嗰個時效上高啦，係有一個一致嘅處理方法。咁依個係我哋第誒所講第五點。咁至於其他嘅點咧，我哋喺我哋。

177
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,010
睇唔少。

178
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,110
contradictory outcomes that may arise.

179
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,190
adhere to transfer pricing requirements and the compliance requirements there too.

180
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,860
好唔該曬黃生，嗯，next one we'll have our Mr Martin Richard from Ernst Young啊。

181
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,000
has not been used very much, and if we're going to have a new transfer pricing rule, why don't we get rid of the old section 20 to avoid any confusions?

182
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:56,900
On this, so we would recommend that Section 15F be repealed, and we just rely on what the rest of the world is doing, which is looking at OECD guidelines and Dempi commentary therein.

183
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:59,500
The separate entity principle, the OECD authorised approach. Now, given that section 50AAK is adopting also the separate entity approach in a wider context, can we just replace section 17G and just replace it with section 50AAK?

184
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:30,210
Thank you very much. So a number of the points that I'm going to outline now have already been submitted formally in a written format. But I'd like to give you a high level overview of the 11 points that were made in our written submission. Firstly, we'd like to seek some clarification about the interaction between source and transfer pricing.

185
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:50,500
Both source principles and TP principles seek to tax international trade with a Hong Kong nexus. However, there can be still situations of contradictions in outcome, and we would like to have some clarification on the hierarchy and interaction between source and transfer pricing to deal specifically with certain contradictory.

186
00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:13,600
第二，我們會希望政府考慮廢除現有的第20條，因應現有第20條是歷史性的轉售價立法，我認為大家都可以認可，不是那麼完善。

187
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:41,830
Thirdly, last year there was a Section 17G introduced to try and outline for non-resident financial institutions in Hong Kong with a permanent establishment to outline that the attribution of profits to such PE's of non-resident financial institutions would be determined on the basis of.

188
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:20,100
Fourthly, a point that has been outlined a number of times with respect to domestic transactions, where there is no overall Hong Kong tax advantage, Hong Kong from a jurisdiction perspective, then we should dispense with having any arm's length requirements on that. The issue at the moment is that the

189
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:40,110
Definition of Hong Kong tax advantage is done on an entity level and not on a jurisdiction level. In a situation where you have domestic transfer pricing arrangements between two profit profitable Hong Kong entities, where it's really left pocket right pocket, it is an additional uncompetitive burden for them to have to.

190
00:29:46,110 --> 00:30:06,120
Our fifth point is again in section fifteen F, pertaining to the deeming of foreign IP income as being taxable in Hong Kong where DMP activities happen in Hong Kong. Our views that this is duplicative and unclear and confusing, given that there is already significant commentary on the.

191
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:26,130
處理Dempi活動，內於OECD指引，和OECD指引已經特別包括入IRO。特別注意，於第15F，是沒有説明，如果Dempi發生，如何Dempi已經可以獲得其他轉移價格安排的酬金。

192
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,630
啊！

193
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,250
係。

194
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:08,030
Would like to highlight that why we are generally in support of the.

195
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:56,770
第一是排除掉的， domestic transactions。

196
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:25,230
Germany, Singapore and other U.S. or U.K. have included domestic transactions.

197
00:31:51,160 --> 00:32:00,010
as to whether they want to enter into an APA, if they have no certainty of how long this APA will last in terms of negotiation and how much it will cost.

198
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:40,790
Thank you for inviting the taxation issue to give our views on proposed amendment bill.

199
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:31,330
Okay，I am Mr. Ah，Mr. Richard。I think time's up for you。啊，下一位係啊香港税務學會嘅黃瑞強先生。阿黃生唔該你。Thank you, Chairman。I would like to address in English。

200
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:30,250
Double taxation relief, whereas 491C actually adds on additional conditions to be able to get that double tax relief. So it's contrary to the to the objective of Amendment Bill Six.

201
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:58,140
we we have finally submitted a written submission this morning, I mean near lunchtime, and I hope that will give you you have a copy of the submissions if you want to refer to the details of our submission.

202
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:17,980
0.8 with respect to APA as well. We seek to clarify the grounds for acceptance and rejection of an APA. A lot of tax authorities around the world give criteria for entering onto an APA or being rejected. There is no criteria in Hong Kong that gives uncertainty as well.

203
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:46,140
For example, if you're a contract R amp D provider in Hong Kong, clearly you're doing DMP on behalf of a foreign IP owner, but you are already compensated through a service level agreement. It's unclear within Section fifteen F on how DMP would actually be quantified and taxed, whereas the OECD guidelines is very clear with a significant commentary.

204
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:17,230
點六，section forty nine one C imposes additional conditions for double tax relief, and should be clarified or repealed. So, in an exploratory explanatory memorandum associated with Bill six, we're talking about trying to enhance the current provisions for double.

205
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:51,160
0.7，The APA program we recommend we replace the hourly fee with a fixed fee. We did a comprehensive survey around the world. We're not aware of other jurisdictions doing APAs on an hourly fee basis. Certainly fees are applied, but not on an hourly basis. It gives a lot of uncertainty to taxpayers.

206
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:28,320
Amendment bill for the reasons stated in the briefing papers and other colleagues have stated earlier. We just want to highlight some of the areas that are of concern that we recommend some amendment or removal of.

207
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:48,330
those areas. now we have listed out six major points, six areas which I want to focus here. and there are also other relatively minor points listed in the appendix which you can refer to after this deputation.

208
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,280
唔同。

209
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,390
我都。

210
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
啊！

211
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,360
啊！

212
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,930
啊啊！

213
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,970
tax only and not.

214
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,010
from the TP rules， except those。

215
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,860
of the T.P.U. on purely domestic transactions.

216
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:53,470
至少，current time， we should take it out of the scope.

217
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:24,280
entities which are subject to different tax rates. Now in Hong Kong, we understand that we have some some.

218
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:39,460
tax preferential rates at half, half of the income tax rate and and we think, such as aircraft leasing, lesseur managers, but we think to.

219
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:47,030
and and and more time should be given to to Hong Kong to become accustomed to the newly introduced TP regime, and we consider that a progressive approach should be adopted, and and and and.

220
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:17,060
from the scope of TPU rules, I think some of the earlier speakers has already given their views on it. I don't want to repeat some of the rationale behind. Apart now, the first of course, the administration have stated other countries like China, France, Germany.

221
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:45,530
In the TP rule, and and we want to highlight that as James said earlier, these com these these countries most of them have long relief where we don't have, so so we don't have the compensation so.

222
00:34:46,670 --> 00:35:06,680
on on a group basis there is no tax advantage, but an adjustment is still made and we think that is unnecessary. In China, we understand that related party transactions are generally exempt.

223
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,550
係。

224
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,030
在發薪額。

225
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:28,760
unite of the international community's expectation, we are generally supportive of the legislation.

226
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,940
And risk imposing double taxation on companies that are not seeking to engage in tax avoidance.

227
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:20,800
that if there is any abuse in the

228
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,920
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for inviting us to come here today to make some comments on the draft legislation on behalf of KPMG.

229
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:37,020
However, we do have some concern. I think you know the other speaker also mentioned about you know the concern that we have on the details of the proposal.

230
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:01,520
We have made more detailed submission in writing, so in view of the limited time this afternoon, I will concentrate here on only a few key points.

231
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:45,570
首先， obviously， I looked on the transfer pricing requirement， which are currently draft to apply to transaction entirely within Hong Kong。

232
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:07,660
We would request that the domestic transfer pricing requirement be lifted, except in limited circumstances, to ease the compliance burden on taxpayer.

233
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:57,520
provided all the relevant transactions take place within companies that are not subject to a special tax regime, we would consider the opportunities for obtaining a tax advantage to be limited.

234
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:43,020
Following the introduction of comprehensive central pricing legislation in Hong Kong, the damper functions performed in Hong Kong should already be accurately remunerated through an arm's length charge.

235
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:23,200
Secondly, as also mentioned by other speakers, we are concerned that the proposal in section 15F regarding the taxation of international property held overseas arising from dampy function exercised in Hong Kong go too far.

236
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:59,940
to prevent abuse, the current section sixteen one, capital A of the IRO already address this specific concern, and we we don't think it's necessary to to go beyond the minimum BAPS standards for application.

237
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:26,020
所以那係第一點我 want to supplement。第二點係也包括排除，税收税和財產税從範圍內的TP。我們認為國際慣例是適用TP規則到企業收入。

238
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:14,190
The third point is about removing the steeming provision on income from intellectual property under Section 15F. I think the earlier speakers have also talked a lot on the the DMP function, the OECD guidelines on it, and we also think.

239
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:45,320
Worked MP function the current sixty one A genuine avoidance already addressed. Mr Wong, I think time is up for you, and we'll of course we will read your detail written submission. Next, we'll have Mr Curtis from KPMG, Mr. Thank you.

240
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,850
restriction with which there's no DTA.

241
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,570
我們 aware of clients for whom this is a real concern.

242
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,290
香港考慮引入自然雙重税 relief。

243
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,750
Further, we cannot see any mechanism within Section 15F for credit.

244
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,320
and considered the measure to be out of step with the tax fairness agenda.

245
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:16,850
該立法草案也未作考慮海外税款可能遭受的影響。

246
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:37,700
And also to apply the rules where an equivalent amount of tax is paid overseas.

247
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,460
It is hard to see the benefit of forcing taxpayer to go through lengthy and costly overseas tax disputes.

248
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:56,480
We are concerned that the bill, brought about by international concern about tax avoidance, should be encouraging the avoidance of international taxes.

249
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:47,560
finally, we note that the draft legislation suggests that Hong Kong will only grant double tax relief where all foreign tax minimisation steps has been taken.

250
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:30,660
我會 therefore suggest at least that mechanism be inserted to prevent double tax arising from arising to give credit for amounts already remitted to Hong Kong.

251
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:09,910
要被給付 for a month recharge to Hong Kong in the form of remuneration for the service performed， meaning that the same income could effectively be charged twice。

252
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:54,440
We also note that such a heavy taxation policy in respect of stampy functions is likely to undermine the government's initiative to develop Hong Kong as an R&D hub.

253
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:49,800
Thirdly, we are concerned that several sections in the legislation impose a more onerous position on territory with which Hong Kong has a DTA that territory with which it doesn't.

254
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:22,110
We recognise in the current tax environment that it is important for Hong Kong's continuing role as an international financial and commercial centre that it continue to abide by the taxation standards as set by the international community, and we acknowledge the effort of the government in doing this.

255
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:10,330
We refer to in particular to section 81A C, where the exemption that currently applies to Hong Kong employees will be placed, but where the employees are working in a treaty jurisdiction, and to section 161C, where the existing ability to claim deduction for overseas tax defer will be limited to.

256
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,730
我們會建議這個要求被移除。

257
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,540
好難去掌握誒依個收誒服務所產產生嘅收費嘅。

258
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,150
喺呢度，我想帶出幾個對商家同埋專業人士比較切身嘅問題。

259
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:17,610
which may affect the relations with the local tax authority, where when there is no overall benefit to them.

260
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:03,470
呢一個關聯方嘅關係嘅定義太過廣泛，對社會上好多嘅生意人會大過，都係太過誒苛刻嘅條列條件。

261
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:59,990
因為有關嘅做法可以顯示香港會致力打擊跨境逃税嘅活動，令到香港可以維持國際金融同埋商業中心嘅地位。

262
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:29,990
我們也考慮到，給出當前的變遷速度和國際税收標準，是難以看到一個共識已經達成，就什麼會構成可觀的步驟。

263
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:53,200
噉佢哋之間嘅交易便需要去遵循獨立交易嘅原則，而如果唔符合豁免條例嘅話，亦都需要準備同期嘅文檔。

264
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:54,000
如果冇令國家少收税收嘅情況底下，佢哋係唔需要納税人準備同期問檔，變相反映香港嘅要求比起鄰近嘅國家更加嚴謹。

265
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:40,770
而且境內關聯交易亦都包括喺入邊，而每一個報告亦都超過五十板子。呢一樣對商家產生極大嘅負荷。我哋可以參考新加坡或者中國對同期民黨嘅要求。

266
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:49,740
Thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman. Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman。啊，下一位係啊自由黨嘅謝先生，謝生唔該你係誒，大家好誒，主席大家好，我係自由黨嘅謝橋章，我哋係支持實施BEPs方案嘅。

267
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:16,460
但係自由黨亦都希望當局可以盡力維持本港嘅簡單低税制，採取務實可行嘅策略，以降低受影響嘅企業，尤其是冇辦法承受太多行政工作成本嘅中小企。

268
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:40,520
第一個係關於關聯方嘅定義問題喺呢個新嘅條例底下，controlled person of一個business係包括埋behaviour嘅control。舉個例，如果甲方係乙方嘅唯一收入來源，甲方就會成為乙方嘅controlled person。

269
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:33,310
Our preference in this regard would be that Hong Kong, where possible, transaction with treaty and non-treaty territories consistently and certainly not so as to disadvantage treaty partners. Given the source principle that underpins Hong Kong taxation, we think it would be advantages for.

270
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:23,850
第二係同期文檔上面要求嘅問題，喺新嘅條例底下，公司需要呈交三個report，分別係國別報告、master file同埋local file。呢個要求實在唔合理，特別係master file同埋local file喺新嘅條例底下。

271
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:14,390
第三係關於收費標準嘅問題，而家APA嘅收費係fixed嘅，新嘅條例底下會變成跟隨負責人人員所用嘅時間去計算。表面上係用者自負，實際上係令人唔敢使用税目税局嘅服務，因為人根本係好。

272
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:24,990
門檻好低。

273
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,940
或 at the minimum， we we suggest that。

274
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,610
Further details on our comments has been submitted to the Bills Committee in writing.

275
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:53,580
如果佢唔能夠發現公司數字嘅虛假，喺新嘅條例底下，可能需要坐監。

276
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:24,400
今天，普華永道會想藉此機會，來強調五個我們認為是最高優先級的議題。

277
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:50,850
Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting Price Waterhouse Coopers to express our views to the committee today.

278
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:36,220
當然係一個烏託邦嘅理想世界底下，核數師會清楚瞭解被審計公司嘅所有數字。

279
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,210
最後想帶出一點係關於八十二A對會計師行拍賣嘅要求過於苛刻。

280
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:09,850
我們建議，將轉移 pricing 則適用於關聯人士，應限於涉及非香港關聯人士的問題。

281
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:22,890
懲罰實在太過苛刻啦！情況就好似一個醫生，如果醫死咗人嘅話，就需要坐監一樣。呢樣嘢有少少不合情理。

282
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:16,680
我們相信，它不是必要讓香港的轉移定價規例去超越BAPs最低標準。它承諾要實施。

283
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:47,360
但係實際上，如果公司故意隱瞞嘅話，一般嘅核數師亦都難以察覺。佢哋只能夠用佢哋最大嘅努力去保證公司數字嘅正確性。

284
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:41,510
所以，首先，為咗，作為，也提到了，由其他講者，所提出的轉售價規則，目前適用於涉及人員，覆蓋本地和跨境活動的實體。

285
00:46:51,260 --> 00:47:06,970
我們在支持法案所採取的方向，以及政府致力於實施BAPS。説完，我們相信這些措施被建議，應該不會從維持香港税制簡單和地域來源。

286
00:47:41,920 --> 00:48:00,970
now the inclusion of domestic transactions, particularly with respect to the transfer pricing master file and local file documentation requirements, will only add onerous compliance burdens to both local business as well as the Indian Revenue Department, with very likely little overall impact on the government revenue.

287
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:13,870
呢個收喺呢個懲罰，未免過於苛刻啦。而且國別報告嘅主要目的係幫助税務機構喺唔同嘅財政數據入邊鎖定調查嘅目標，並唔係要核實國別報告上邊數據嘅準確性。所以坐金嘅要求。

288
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,510
thirdly， and also as suggested by some other speakers。

289
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,700
所以，我們實際上建議移除第15F節從法案。

290
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,810
如果法案通過，such option is no longer available.

291
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,850
我們相信，第15F會創造不確定性到其申請。

292
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:32,680
with a very significant risk of double taxation in Hong Kong and across borders.

293
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,200
我們 therefore suggest to confine the application to the transfer pricing rules only to profits tax.

294
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:54,800
Our fourth comment relates to foreign tax credits and amendment to section 8, capital 1A, subsection C.

295
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:08,890
第15F條文，which act as a deeming provision， is a section which we consider not necessary.

296
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:02,580
Before the amendment, taxpayers are able to choose between either claiming a tax credit or a tax exemption.

297
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:40,460
Our second comment relates to how the bill intends to apply to profits tax, salaries tax and property tax.

298
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:22,470
政府會考慮提供 relief to domestic transactions， to the extent there is no differentials in effective tax rate.

299
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:32,210
這會幫助維持一個適當的平衡，之間維持和達成BEPS標準，和也保留香港的税競爭力。

300
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:42,410
This outcome would make Hong Kong less attractive as a hub, a location for research and development, as compared with our regional competitors.

301
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:51,200
And at this dance, the inclusion of salaries tax and property tax will create unintended consequences for small and medium-sized businesses and individuals.

302
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:19,330
In fact, this change also creates a situation where taxpayers are better off rendering services in a non-double tax agreement territory rather than a double tax agreement territory.

303
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:22,010
The wording of the transfer pricing rules in other parts of the bill, such as section 50AAF, is already sufficient to achieve the objective of recognising value creation in intellectual property.

304
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:43,310
總括而言，我哋自由黨希望當局以循序漸進嘅方式去實施有關嘅改動，唔好因為要符合國際組織嘅標準而過於急進咁推行推行改變現現行嘅做法。多謝各位。多謝。Next we have a Price White House Cooper，謝謝李。

305
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,210
或otherwise amount be changed to range.

306
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,780
在實，設定轉移價是實際上並非一個精確的科學。

307
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,500
overall，this is inconsistent with the normal international tax practice.

308
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,690
Our fifth and final comment relates to specific wording within Section 50AAF Subsection 1.

309
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:01,580
它會創造不必要的行政負擔，對雙方的納税人和IRD。

310
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:32,240
我們建議將該修正案撤銷，因為這個變動是不合理的，並造成一些納税人的不公。

311
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:49,020
the phrase the arm's length amount is used. The proposed regulation implies there is only one correct transfer price to be used.

312
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:04,830
Under international tax practice and the OECD T P guidelines, an arms length amount usually refers to a range of prices instead of an exact price.

313
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:15,850
所以，Furthermore， the draft bill has the potential to empower an I.R.D. assessor to select an arbitrary point in the range in applying the transfer pricing rules.

314
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:31,010
所以，我們建議將第50AAF節1段的用詞改為，以容許靈活性在釐定補償金額時，例如，將「the」改為「and」。

315
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:16,370
More importantly, cross-border transactions present the greater risk of loss to tax collection, and hence we consider the IRD's resources could be better deployed enforcing TP rules for cross-border related party transactions only.

316
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:54,810
once again, we appreciate the opportunity to address to the Bills Committee today. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Lee. 下一位係德勤會計師事務所嘅張慧賢小姐。I'm Miss Zhang. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to represent Deloitte, and we have submitted our comments to the Bills Committee.

317
00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:14,820
In the interest of time for today, I'll just provide a summary of the key issues raised in our submission letter. First of all, Deloitte welcomes and supports the government's efforts to codify the transfer pricing regime into the Inland Revenue Ordinance, as part of a wider undertaking to implement BAPS. But there are a

318
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:34,830
幾個issues或幾個areas，which we wish to highlight and provide our comments. First of all, and something that has been repeatedly highlighted by the other speakers, is in relation to section A F and the inclusion of domestic transactions in the scope of the section. We are of the opinion that the inclusion

319
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:54,840
of domestic transactions within the scope of the transfer pricing regime is excessive, as it would place an onerous compliance obligation on taxpayers which do not have cross-border related party transactions. Whilst relief could be sought by a disadvantaged person in the event that an adjustment is made by the Inland Revenue Department.

320
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:36,980
The second comment relates to section 58C, which is on the proposed transfer pricing documentation requirements in Hong Kong. Under which we have two observations. First, we ask the government to consider exempting Hong Kong taxpayers with offshore sourced income earned from non-Hong Kong resident related parties.

321
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,200
啲。

322
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:43,120
從such documentation requirements， on the basis that no Hong Kong tax advantage would be created.

323
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:57,000
一次嘅會議之前咧，係將啊呢一個嘅誒詳細嘅書面回應咧，係畀到我哋誒立法會呢個委員會嘅秘書處嘅。噉我請阿黎生作出回應先，好唔好？唔該，阿黎生嚇。誒。

324
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:23,890
會 definitely arise， so we ask the government to also reconsider， either providing further clarification on section 15F， or at best to take it away as we consider 50AAF is already wide enough in scope。

325
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:21,310
我再次問政府考慮保留收入排除，於第8節第1A段，對應於在DTA地區負税的個人，或給予納税人選擇申請減免，於DTA條款或國內法例。

326
00:53:43,580 --> 00:54:03,590
and secondly, the proposed bill requires master files and local files to be prepared within six months of the accounting year-end date. We also would welcome additional clarity with regard to the time limit by which the Hong Kong entity is required to submit the TP documentation upon receiving notice from the IR.

327
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:27,070
Next is on section 15F, which we've heard again a lot of comments. We also agree that section 50A F, which is the the wider transfer pricing provision, should be wide enough in scope to empower the IRD to make appropriate adjustment in the circumstances described in section 15F.

328
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:47,450
Whilst we understand 15F seeks to align the dampy functions with income in relation to intellectual property, unfortunately the draft bill does not seem to provide for how the part of income which is to be taxed as a trading receipt in Hong Kong should be determined, and it doesn't limit application of this section in scenarios where the Hong Kong tax payer.

329
00:54:47,450 --> 00:55:07,460
係已經已經補償咗Stampy貢獻，由離岸所有者嘅IP，亦都係點解關於應課税，可能已經由發牌人喺佢嘅家鄉支付咗，有冇任何嘅減免由香港政府，因為如果唔係，雙重課税。

330
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:44,850
I guess the the next comment is on again section eight sub section one A. The bill has amended this section to cover only individuals who are liable to pay tax of substantially the same nature as salaries tax in a non DTA territory for the services rendered.

331
00:55:44,850 --> 00:56:04,860
and the individual who is liable to pay tax in a DTA territory can only claim a foreign tax credit under the section. This amendment seems to have provided less tax savings for individuals working in DTA territories than for those in non-DTA, and this seems to go against the purpose of having a DTA in place. So we.

332
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:47,110
反映翻喺我哋嗰個即係法例修訂誒誒誒誒條例有有變嘅。

333
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:01,390
咁呢個就係我希望我哋跟住落嚟嘅嗰個嗰個工作嗰個方向噉樣。

334
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:56,530
經濟制裁嘅話咧，所以我哋都希望能夠主動去做好呢件事情。咁亦都希望在座嘅商會朋友或者係專業界別朋友明白，其實我哋做呢一個工作都係以香港整體利益為出發點嘅啫。

335
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:23,050
係咪誒參與國際誒税務合作嚟講嘅話咧，都有一個誒誒誒peer review有一個複核喺度嘅。咁如果發覺我哋係香港或者某一個地區，佢對於誒支持BAPS呢一個。

336
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:34,890
嚟修定嗰個誒原因同埋代個動機，大家會更加明白點解我哋會提出呢個建議。同埋就頭先誒一啲朋友所提及到一啲誒比較關注嘅事項，我亦都想做個初步回應。我基本上我誒希望從呢三方面去畀個資料大家參考翻。

337
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:41,800
last but not least, it's on section 8th relating to penalties to service providers for CBCR report preparation. The CBCR is based on the large volume of source information for many companies in many jurisdictions, and the service provider can only rely on. So placing such owners of

338
00:56:41,800 --> 00:57:01,810
On the service provider would make the process burdensome, and also would result in a lot of audit and verification work. So that would make it quite unreasonably wide and expensive. I think hands up for for you, Ms. Zhou. On my behalf, I think and and I think I should thank all the deputation in making.

339
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:21,820
presentation today, and no doubt the amendments introduced by the amendment number six, Bill two hundred one seven, is very important to us and is a very major change to the inland revenue ordinance as well. 啊，咁以下嘅時間咧，我就交翻畀啊政府嘅官員。

340
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:41,830
啦，就讓佢哋有啲時間咧，係首先回應一下啊各位誒團體誒今日所提嘅意見。但係咧，我係會要求咧誒政府咧係對啊所有團體每一個嘅誒意見咧都作出一個嘅書面回應，亦都希望誒政府可以喺下。

341
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:17,770
唔該，主席，多謝主席，多謝議員同埋誒在座表達意見嘅朋友。誒，首先我想，我我相信我跟住落嚟嘅回應咧，就希望從三方面去表達翻，即係我哋政府個睇法啦。第一方面就係個整體嘅回應，第二方面就係我亦都想大家去睇翻我哋做呢一個法。

342
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:55,180
首先講翻嗰個誒整體回應嗰方面咧，我好多謝在座誒誒先後發言嘅十二位朋友誒。頭先我都有數過，就在座有商會有政黨，亦都有會計專業界別嘅朋友。剛才發言嘅十二位朋友入邊嚟講嘅話咧，我都數過有八位朋。

343
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:15,190
朋友都清楚表達咗，佢哋明白、理解、知道政府有需要做呢一個即係轉讓定價嘅誒法則，去符合翻國際誒間嗰個誒税務要求，特別係滿足翻誒經合組織對於我哋香港作為一個即係誒參與國際税務合作嘅一個好重要嘅工作。

344
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:35,200
首先，我對於大家誒對於呢一個工作嗰個支持同埋，我哋理解我哋要做呢一樣嘢嗰個原因嘅話咧，我係非常感謝嘅。咁當然，我亦都明白誒，頭先有好多朋友嚟講嘅話咧，喺一啲具體嘅誒誒事務或者一啲條款入邊嚟講嘅話咧，都提出咗一啲意見。

345
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:55,210
或者啲查詢，或者係有啲建議，我哋係咪可以用另一個方法做咧？呢一個誒，呢啲意見我哋係非常之誒理解，亦都尊重嘅，因為我哋都明白，雖然我哋喺二零一六年尾嘅時候做咗個公眾諮詢，當時嚟講嘅話咧，都主要係就一啲原則性嘅問題，去希望去誒理。

346
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:28,730
政策嘅話咧，誒，作為同我頭先講嗰兩個原因係有關連嘅。

347
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:43,920
工作誒執行指引嚟講個DIP因入邊，就將轉讓定價嘅嘅要求嚟講嘅話咧，就詳細列出嚟嘅。

348
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:23,510
為目的嘅，咁喺呢一度嚟講嘅話咧，我希望就頭先即係在座發言嗰啲朋友有幾個都比較多朋友講嘅課題嚟講嘅話咧，我畀一啲初步嘅誒回應，大家去參考翻嘅。

349
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:39,390
噉我哋亦都明白到一樣嘢，頭先有幾位好有幾位朋友都提及到，就係話其實如果係公香港公司與公司之間嘅一啲本地交易，如果整體上係冇一個税務利益，呢啲唔應該去。

350
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:15,220
解大家嘅意見噉。如果大家睇翻我哋當時出嗰份諮詢文件嘅話咧，都係講緊三十幾頁嘅啫。而睇下睇翻我哋呢個修訂條例草案嘅話咧，係講拍幾頁嘅噉，所以嗰啲細節係多咗出嚟。呢個係理解，因為法例一定係要清晰同埋係客觀嘅。咁所以當大家睇到嗰個細則嘅時候，

351
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:35,230
有一啲具體嘅意見或者問題，呢個係絕對正常理解嘅。噉，所以我哋都好希望一樣嘢咧，就係好似頭先啊主席所講。誒，我係知道下一次委員會條例草案委員會應該係三月初嘅時候開會。我哋好希望咧，就喺下一次嘅時候嚟講，就將已經交咗即係書面意見書嘅團體。

352
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:55,240
睇或者係跟住呢一段時間，誒會交誒意見書嘅團體，同埋今日大家發言嗰個重點嚟講嘅話咧，我哋有個整體同埋全面嘅回應。我諗相信到時可能大家睇翻我哋嗰個回應嘅話咧，就會即係對於誒理解政府嗰個睇法立場會有一個更加清晰嘅理解啦。噉。

353
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:21,680
咁第二方面，我想同大家都講翻，就話究竟點解我哋要做呢一個修訂條例草案咧？噉樣其實主要咧就有兩個目的嘅，一個咧就係符合翻經合組織O E C D對於誒要打擊Beps呢一個嘅行動計劃，侵蝕税基同埋轉移利潤啊！如果

354
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:41,690
講佢入邊有十五個行動計劃，誒其中有四個嚟講作為一個最低標準，係希望即係國際間嗰啲誒社會同埋國家能夠係參與嘅。咁所以香港我哋今次嗰個做法嚟講嘅話咧，就主要集中喺參與嗰四個最低標準嘅工作入邊，咁亦都。

355
01:01:47,390 --> 01:02:07,400
咁點解我哋一定要做呢一樣嘢咧？就大家我諗在座好多商會或者係專業界別嘅朋友都理解嘅。其實誒，經合組織同埋係誒誒歐洲聯盟嚟講方面，佢係對於其他國家地區係咪有一個公平課税嘅誒誒政策？

356
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:43,340
例如話嗰個參與性或者積極性係成二嘅話咧，就有機會係將佢列為一個誒不合作嘅誒誒税誒誒税務地區，噉就有機會咧就施以制裁嘅。咁所以，我哋香港為咗要保住我哋作為一個國際金融中心嘅名聲，同埋更加重要係避免受到一啲不必要嘅。

357
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:16,820
咁第二個原因，我哋想做誒呢一個噉嘅條例抽草案嘅重點嚟講嘅話咧，就大家我知道在座好多會計界朋友其實誒，如果睇翻誒OECD對於BAPS呢一個行動計劃嚟講嘅話咧，其實去打擊侵蝕税基轉移利潤嚟講嘅話咧，個轉讓定價。

358
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:36,830
transfer pricing其實做真係一個核心重點嚟嘅，而對於呢個核心重點嚟講，喺我哋而家個税務條例入邊個主體條文其實著墨就唔多嘅，我哋都係靠税務條例入邊嘅一啲一般性嘅條款，而更加重要咧就係話喺而家税務局嗰個誒誒工作紙其中一份。

359
01:03:44,200 --> 01:04:04,210
咁所以我哋點解有啲朋友就話關心就係話點解我哋要將嗰個誒轉讓定價，就算牽涉及到本地交易嗰啲，都要將佢納入呢一個税務今次嘅修訂條例草案入邊嚟講嘅話咧，其實主要兩個原因。第一方面嚟講嘅話咧，就為我哋其實税務局行咗幾十。

360
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:24,220
嘅轉讓定價嗰個執行政策嘅話咧，就係將佢歸入翻個法例入邊，提供一個更加堅實嘅基嘅嘅法律基礎，令到誒個納税人對於呢一個嘅條文同埋嗰個要求有個更加清晰嘅了理解。呢個就對內嘅，對外嗰方面嚟講嘅話咧，我哋都要同經合組織（OECD）有個交代。

361
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:45,420
咁頭先有啲朋友講到就話誒，其實兩間公司誒之間嗰啲誒誒誒本地關聯交易都未必一定係會。

362
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:35,530
嗰個工作重點，但係我哋都要好強調一樣嘢，就係所有公司都應該係以呢個即係arming principle呢個獨立交易原則去處理呢啲關聯交易。呢個我覺得係大家要持之以恆嘅嘅基本宗旨嚟嘅。

363
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:43,400
同埋大家朋友都要正視呢個噉嘅風險呢個問題。我哋其實主要就係處理呢一堆嘅嘅個案，所有其他一啲手法、正常交易係落實嗰個獨立交易原則、個啱聲principle嗰啲誒本土交易啊、誒本地公司嘅話咧，呢個唔係我哋跟進嘅重點嚟㗎。

364
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:42,800
今次透過呢個即係條例草案，都希望鼓勵多啲公司去用呢個安排。咁而去到收費個方面嚟講嘅話咧，誒基本上而家就係建議用一個即係用者自付一個按時收費嘅形式噉樣樣。因為我諗大家特別係在座嗰啲會計界朋友都明白咧。

365
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:44,230
就係話，因為如果當O E C D睇翻我哋香港誒嗰個税務條例做誒BAPS嗰度，我哋係做咗啲嘅工作啦。但係佢發覺我哋最根本、最基礎嗰個即係誒轉讓定價transfer pricing入邊，如果其實都冇納入到嗰個即係主體嘅。

366
01:04:44,230 --> 01:05:04,240
法案入邊或者主體嗰條例入邊嘅話咧，佢都可能會對我哋去落實執行呢一個Beps呢個行動計劃嚟講係有一個大嘅質疑嘅。咁所以變咗，我哋都係喺對內同埋對外嚟講都有需要將呢一個行咗幾十年嘅嘅嘅轉讓定價嘅法則（transit pricing rules）嚟講嘅話咧，放入今次我哋嗰個。

367
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:24,250
修訂草案入邊，咁希望我呢一個解釋嚟講嘅話咧，令到在座嘅朋友或者議員能夠點明白點解今次我哋誒除咗要話做BEPS好似一個OECD嘅嘅要求，經合組織嘅要求，我哋集中睇嗰啲大公司或者跨國公司咪算咯？點解我哋要睇埋本身香港嘅轉讓定價嗰個？

368
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:49,030
第三方面嚟講嘅話咧，我希望我頭先聽到好多朋友就我哋今次條例草案嘅一啲具體嘅建議咧，就畀咗一啲即係誒回應啊，同埋有啲誒誒反建議畀咗我哋。噉我哋同税務局同埋律政司嘅同事翻到去一定係會細心研究大家嘅意見，睇一睇有冇一啲即係。

369
01:05:49,030 --> 01:06:09,040
嘅地方，我哋可以喺嗰個即係誒寫法各方面寫得能夠更加清晰，去剔除大家嘅疑慮，或者如果有啲不需要做嘅工作，我哋都希望真係唔使做，因為我哋都明白法例嚟講應該係以即係以最低限度嘅嘅最少嘅條文去達至到嗰個基本目的。我哋都係以呢一個為。

370
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:44,030
第一個咧就係講到嗰個誒本地交易。我聽到頭先在座有唔少即係會計界別嘅朋友都有提及到，就話，既然嗰個誒誒誒Babs行動計劃主要都係針對跨國企業同埋國與國之間嗰個即係誒税務安排嘅話。

371
01:06:44,030 --> 01:07:04,040
我哋係咪可以豁免嗰啲本地公司嘅本地交易？誒誒誒，入呢個誒規管一範圍之之內咧？噉嘅樣噉，我諗大家頭先聽翻我講第二部分就係點解我哋要做呢個條例草案，就係其實就係將税務局行咗幾十年呢一

372
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:24,050
個嘅轉讓定價嘅嘅法規，就由一個指引就放翻入個條文入邊嘅。所以精神上嚟講，其實我哋冇變道嘅。其實而家你問税務局嘅話咧，佢都會話畀你聽，轉讓定價係應該喺香港執行嘅。咁所有公司都應該係係以呢一個嘅嘅嘅原則為一個出發點嘅。

373
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:59,680
特別關心或者係我哋要特別走去即係誒做一啲好詳細嘅調查。呢一個大原則，我哋同税局係同意嘅，因為我哋都唔係話要揾一啲即係不必要嘅工作嚟做，亦都應應該集中係處理一啲高風險嘅嘅嘅一啲個案或者係一啲情況。

374
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:19,690
咁所以我哋喺整體上執行方面嚟講嘅話咧，都如税務局一貫嗰個措施嚟講嘅話咧，就以一個風險評估為基礎嘅。咁如果我哋覺得嗰啲公司本地公司嘅嘅誒誒本地交易其實係冇一個即係即係特別嘅税務利益嘅話咧，咁呢個唔係税務。

375
01:08:45,700 --> 01:09:05,710
產生嗰個税務嘅嘅利益嘅效應嘅噉樣，咁呢個我哋明白嘅。如果兩間公司都有利潤嘅話咧，咁的確可能係兩間本地公司都喺香港有有利潤需要交利得税嘅話咧，可能佢哋嗰個關聯交易嗰個嗰個影響就冇乜，或者係甚至冇嘅。咁但係如果選傾蝕。

376
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,440
以採納大家嗰個意見。

377
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,200
咁喺一個地域來源。

378
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:32,110
多誒誒誒人手去處理到嗰個結果嘅話咧，咁嗰個收費係平咧。咁呢個真係按嗰個個案而議，希望大家理解呢一樣嘢咯。

379
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:48,120
第三個意見嚟講嘅話咧，頭先我都聽到有唔少朋友講，就係話誒嗰個誒誒做嗰啲誒。

380
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:44,480
得我哋應該真係畀充足合理嘅時間佢哋做嘅噉，所以我哋亦都可以即係好積極噉樣睇一睇嗰個時間係咪可以放鬆啲咧噉嘅樣。咁第二方面嚟講嘅話咧，頭先有啲朋友講到在話，究竟喺嗰個。

381
01:16:44,790 --> 01:17:03,770
公司turnover係少過一億嘅話咧，誒誒或者資產少過一億嘅話咧，我哋就要佢做呢啲檔案㗎嘛。咁後屘我哋而家都將嗰個門檻就將嗰個公司嘅收入同埋資產就提升到去二億嘅，希望係即係少啲公司去做呢一個工作啦噉樣。咁但係我哋都希望大家明白。

382
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:25,720
合到兩間背地公司，一間係誒誒誒有利潤，一間係虧蝕嘅話咧，可能對於一啲有心人或者係一啲公司，佢可以透過轉讓定價嘅一啲特別安排，令令到佢嗰個税務誒係有改變嘅話咧，呢個係有機會發生嘅。所以我諗税務局。

383
01:09:43,860 --> 01:10:03,870
第二方面嚟講嘅話咧，就誒，剛才亦都有啲朋友提及到，就係話去到嗰個誒誒誒預先誒審議定價（advance pricing arrangement）嗰方面嗰個收費安排咧，大家都關心嘅。其實我哋出發税務嗰個出發點係好嘅，因為我哋都希望咧，就係話如果啲公司。

384
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:23,880
如果有啲重大或者特殊嘅交易嘅話，佢想事先同税務局去攞個即係基本嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅理解或者共識，然之後喺喺喺嗰個轉型定價方面，然之後再做呢啲交易，第時報税啊，誒或者做交易嘅時候有個比較清晰啲嘅理解同埋清楚嘅話咧，對大家都好嘅。咁所以其實税務局。

385
01:10:43,080 --> 01:11:03,090
做一個簡單個案，同埋做一個複雜個案咧，嗰個成本真係可以相差好遠嘅。有一啲個案嚟講，甚至可能要税務局嘅同事去香港以外嘅地方做一啲實地視察，或者瞭解下個嘅業務，然之後先可以做到個分析同埋判斷嘅。咁基本上，我哋而家都係即係希望就係以一個。

386
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:23,100
收回成本嘅嘅原則，走去做嘅啫噉樣。對於一啲即係複雜大嘅交易嚟講，就話咧嗰個收費，如果用嘅時間要多或者資源多嘅話咧，收費水平高啲，呢個係係理解嘅，係係係理所當然嘅。但係如果嗰個個案係簡單直接，誒，税務局唔需要用好多時間或者唔需要好多。

387
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:52,720
第三點，頭先有在座好多朋友都提及到咧，就係話對於啲知識產權intellectual property嗰個所謂diminution，我哋點樣處理咧噉樣？咁呢度啊，希望大家都容許我解多些少，就點解今次我哋要做呢一樣嘢咧？其實喺誒經合組織O E C D去今次做呢一個誒誒BAPS嗰個。

388
01:11:52,720 --> 01:12:12,730
個誒誒行動計劃入邊嚟講嘅話咧，佢哋都一個好主導嘅思想，就係話唔希望啲誒企業有一啲轉移利潤啊、侵蝕水機嘅行為，所以佢哋好強調一個重點，就係話誒嗰個利潤應該係同嗰啲經濟活動掛鈎嘅。

389
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:32,860
所以嗰個税收亦都應該同嗰個即係利潤掛鈎，就希望體現翻呢個精神嘅啫。咁而喺經合組織入邊，佢亦都留意到有唔少嘅嘅企業嚟講嘅話咧，喺處理呢一啲知識產權嗰個交易嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，就可能有一啲即係避税或者逃税嘅行為。

390
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:52,870
比方説，假如可能係誒由一間香港，我舉例啦嚇，誒由一間香港公司，佢本身投入咗好多資源去維護一個品牌或者一個知識產權嗰個開發啊，或者係個維護啊、推廣嘅工作嘅。但係呢間香港公司嚟講嘅話咧，就係用一個好低嘅價錢，就將呢一

391
01:12:52,870 --> 01:13:12,880
個噉嘅即係知識產權，透過拉神城，即係誒批咗畀一間海外嘅公司走去擁有啦噉樣。咁然之後咧，就係透過呢間海外公司，就係將呢個嘅即係誒知識產權，就係即係繼續就發畀其他一啲海誒香港以外嘅嘅嘅用家去收取利益噉。

392
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:35,490
收税嘅情況之下嘅話咧，對於呢一啲行為，其實誒，我覺得我哋真係有個需要處理嘅，所以變咗今次聯合組織就提出一個原則，就係話，如果有一啲本地嘅企業，佢喺維護呢啲知識產權入邊都真係做咗一個重大嘅資源投放，同埋有重大嘅開支嘅話咧，即使

393
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:55,500
咦？佢可能係將成個I.P係賣咗畀一個海洋嘅公司嘅話咧，呢一個誒本地公司，如果佢喺嗰個誒誒誒誒開支方面有個重大嘅即係嘅嘅嘅投入嘅話咧，都應該係同呢個海洋公司喺嗰個收入方面有個即係誒誒調。

394
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:45,370
收個根基係好緊要呢樣地域來源同埋嗰個啊定價轉移有衝突嘅時候嚇，噉啊暫時兩點先啦，噉我。

395
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:43,400
如果你呢份誒表上係原封不動去過嘅時候咧，你我我就好擔心，即係我哋立法會都未必畀到咁多資源，你哋去去去執行。

396
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:58,820
呢一個嘅嘅嘅條例嘅，因為誒實在誒唔係話有錢，而家好多錢啦，政府你唔係請一百個assessor就可以做到誒呢一個執行到呢個條例，因為都要訓練，亦都要有相當嘅經驗嘅第一點。

397
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:15,570
啊，第二點咧，提其實頭先好多與會者亦都提出一個問題，就係關於個地域來源徵税同埋呢一個定價轉移，究竟兩者如果有衝突嘅時候，啊，有啲朋友就話係咪地域來源徵税係？

398
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:15,510
整翻誒嘅作為一個徵税安排，呢個其實係經合組織O.E.C.T.提出嘅嘅精神嚟嘅。而我哋今次咧希望就透過呢個税務條例誒修訂草案嚟講嘅話咧，去落實翻呢一個噉嘅精神。噉我明白，可能大家有啲關注就係話喺嗰個雙重會唔會出現一啲雙重徵税嘅個嘅情況啊？

399
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:35,520
或者呢啲個案個定義係咪清楚咧？噉樣呢個我哋都會同税局翻去再檢視。翻我哋而家嗰個條文係咪可以滿足到大家個需要咧？呢個我哋係希望大家諒解，即係呢個唔係我哋無中生有嘅工作嚟嘅。呢個係配合翻O E C D嗰個要求。當然喺落實嗰個細節嘅話咧，我哋越

400
01:14:48,490 --> 01:15:08,500
有關轉讓定價嗰啲文書工作嗰個documentation方面嚟講，係咪可以再簡化啲，或者甚至將嗰個即係factual再提供啲咧噉樣？咁有啲地方，我覺得我哋係可以好積極去處理嘅。譬如話，頭先有至少有兩位朋友提及到做嗰個誒。

401
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:28,510
誒，主體檔案master file嗰方面係咪好似而家我哋嘅建議噉，得六個月時間真係做咧噉樣？呢個我覺得我哋可以用個務實嘅方嘅嘅嘅嘅態度真係睇嘅，因為我哋最緊要就係話需要做呢啲檔案或者文書嘅機構係能夠做好呢啲嘅誒檔案嘅。喺時間方面嚟講，我覺。

402
01:15:44,760 --> 01:16:04,770
誒做呢啲master file或者係主體檔案或者係本地檔案local file嗰方面嚟講，係咪可以將嗰個即係federal係誒係再提高啲係少多啲誒等少啲公司係可以誒需要做呢啲噉嘅檔案咧噉樣呢個誒？

403
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:24,780
出發點我哋完全理解嘅，因為我哋都明白香港作為一個即係誒商業城市，我哋都希望係盡量減低嗰啲企業，特別係中小企嗰個誒循規成本啊，或者係去誒處理呢啲即係税務事宜嗰個誒嗰個工作嘅。咁所以其實喺諮詢期入。

404
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:44,790
入邊，我諗議員都明白到，我或者在座朋友都其實都知道，我哋對於嗰個闊面去做呢一個主體檔案或者本地檔案嗰個要求嚟講嘅話咧，其實做完二零一六年尾嗰次諮詢之後，我哋都放鬆咗嘅。即係本來我哋就話，即係一百人以下嘅公司嗰個誒公。

405
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:24,060
我哋誒都唔可以放得太過鬆，因為如果放得太過鬆嘅話咧，當警級組織翻嚟O E C啲同我哋做peer review嘅話咧，佢就會可能會擔心就話咦，究竟即係誒我哋嗰個reim係咪一個比較即係有力無不嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅一個税務誒誒區域咧？噉樣。

406
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:44,070
咁最一點，我想喺度做一個回應嚟講嘅話咧，我頭先聽到好多聲音就係話誒，大家都希望誒香港去簽多啲避免雙重徵税協議嗰啲C D T A嘅tax agreement翻嚟。呢個我哋完全理解嘅。頭先有朋友提及到，喂澳洲，我哋係咪可以應該傾咧？其實我哋真係。

407
01:17:44,070 --> 01:18:04,080
傾緊嘅，亦都傾咗一段時間嘅。不過，誒要最後簽得成份協議嘅話咧，都真係需要兩個地區都一齊走去做啦。我哋香港嗰個誠意同埋嗰個熱誠係好大嘅噉，但係我哋都希望在座嘅嘅商會或者業界朋友都透過你哋嘅渠渠道。

408
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:24,090
向其他嘅嘅我哋一啲目標嘅嘅地方去去去一齊去做下有啲遊説嘅工作。噉我哋都希望係簽多啲呢一啲噉嘅避免雙重徵税協議C.D.T.A.嘅誒誒tax agreements翻嚟，去對香港營商嘅環境有個幫助。噉我留意到頭先好多朋友提出一樣。

409
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:58,570
公。

410
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,090
或者係咪要需要時間？

411
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:52,150
跟住畀翻我哋嘅委員提問，誒阿周議員或者阿陳議員係。

412
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:30,800
嘢就話喺新嘅條文之下嘅話咧，會唔會令到係我哋香港有？

413
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:05,760
誒，因為我就唔想call up佢哋，因為佢哋誒即係差錯率都好高，好多人都啊。你哋有冇問題問佢哋先？

414
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:57,380
有有噉嘅誒必要性啊，搞到好複雜咧。咁呢個首先我哋第一個印象先啦。咁但係，頭先啊，秘書長亦都講到啦，就話誒，因為做一個公平課税嘅peer review，即係啊，即係誒誒。

415
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:51,340
誒雙重避免雙重徵税協議有C.D.T.agreements嗰啲嗰啲誒誒誒jurisdiction嗰啲公司，好似誒仲不利咧噉樣，反而冇tax treaty agreements嗰啲嘅話咧，仲可能佢容易有啲選擇去避免嗰個嗰個減少嗰個税務協議嘅誒嗰個税務嘅誒嘅嘅負擔。

416
01:18:51,340 --> 01:19:11,350
啱嘅咁呢一方面，我哋會同税務局積極翻去睇一睇，究竟嗰個運作上有冇空間係令到即係我明白大家嗰個對於嗰個一致性係睇得好緊要嘅，同埋誒覺得而家有嘅選擇係應該盡量去去保留嘅。呢個我哋盡力去睇一睇點樣去做到呢？

417
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:31,360
啲噉嘅工作啦，咁或者主席，我嗰個初步個回應就喺到喺到呢度。但係我哋同税務局嘅同事係會翻去好積極，再睇翻頭先誒誒誒在座嗰啲朋友，或者我哋跟住會收落嚟嗰啲書面回應，大家一啲好關注嘅嘅嘅事項，我哋會做一啲歸納。

418
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:51,370
因為我知知道有有有啲事情咧，就好多人都有有關注嘅。噉我哋即係唔係希望話即係以回應某一個團體為目標，反而我哋希望將唔同團體嗰啲意見，大家去去歸納分析。有一啲咧就係大家都關注事情，有一啲就某啲團體會關注事情。我哋都會有一個做一個比較有系統嘅回。

419
01:19:51,370 --> 01:20:11,380
回應等到議員同埋即係即係啲關注嘅團體同埋朋友都比較理解清楚我哋政府嘅立場，或者我嗰個初步回應去到呢度睇睇主席或者係其他議員有冇咩問題？好啊，唔該曬黎秘書長，我我諗咧即係阿黎秘書長，你你呢個回應當然係非常非常之之初步啦，我諗亦都未必係滿足。

420
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:31,390
到誒各位即係與會者嘅一啲嘅關注，但係尤其是咧，我我諗我我我未畀啊各位委員問提問之前咧，我要即係講翻兩點希望各方係注意下，同埋即係税務局咧。第一咧，我哋好關心你哋根本冇可能有一個咁多嘅資源咧，係去。

421
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:35,860
優先啲咧嗱，我諗呢個誒，我希望政府可以喺個回覆度咧，畀翻一個誒比較詳細嘅嘅分析，亦都可能需要。如果你哋有有需要咧，我希望你問一問律政司有冇一個噉嘅法律意見，因為呢個係誒對我哋嗰個税。

422
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:22,380
誒消化下啦嚇，阿陳議員先啦，阿陳振宇。唔該，主席。誒，頭先我誒都好多謝阿黎副秘書長咧，就做咗個好詳細嘅解釋咧，就因為就咁睇咧，我哋就第一個好奇怪啦，即係一個改動一個税務嘅原則咧，噉你要用。

423
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:42,390
百幾頁紙嚟，即係立一個例噉，我哋都覺得好奇怪嘅。咁頭先啊，秘書長就話啦，做諮詢嗰陣時咧就誒三十頁嘅啫。咁但係到因為為咗將一啲具體嘅條文同埋細節咧擺咗落去，咁所以而家就有百幾頁出嚟啦。咁但係誒嗰百幾頁係咪真係需要嘅咧？係咪真係有？

424
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:17,670
國家之間啊，或者地區之間嘅一個重建之後咧，咁政府就覺得有必要主動做好我哋自己嘅一啲誒工作。咁特別咧係咧，明確咧，我哋而家有啲誒税務局誒徵税嘅一啲原則咧，就喺裏邊去做。噉我有得諗，點解我哋係通？

425
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:37,680
過一條BAPS嘅即係法例嘅修改嚟，將個咁根本性嘅問題咧喺呢度嚟明確咧，咁而唔係喺早前其他嘅一啲即係誒相關嘅税務條例度做，而去到呢一個時刻去做一啲噉嘅即係誒叫明確誒税務。

426
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:57,690
一啲原則咧，咁呢個我又係覺得好奇怪嘅。第二個咧，頭先啊，秘書長又講啦，佢話誒，如果係兩間公司喺香港都係同時係納緊税嘅，噉佢覺得可以比較寬鬆咁處理啦。但係反之咧，如果一間公司係有利潤，一間公司而家係虧損嘅，噉你就會特別關注。

427
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,570
開開咪。

428
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,300
有冇人？

429
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,440
開麥啊！唔該。

430
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,710
Cecilia，Gonei，hi。

431
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:31,560
而家咧就係應該係二零一八年底呢一個誒。

432
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:50,940
會計期間就要去做到呢樣嘢啦。咁大家會唔會覺得，譬如即係誒一年期去到二零一九就足夠啊？定係話需要幾長嘅時間？我我就呢個我都想聽下，即係專業團體嘅意見。邊位可以時約舉手想答呢個問題，或者有意見表達？

433
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:17,700
佢之間嘅轉移價格，誒嘅即係行你你話嗰個活動啦嚇。咁但係你呢度咧又會引起好多即係麻煩。呢個係只係而家呢一刻呢兩間公司一齊出現利潤，或者一間賺一間蝕，但係呢個係一個。

434
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:37,710
動態嘅嘢嚟㗎嘛，可能你而家呢一刻係噉，下一年已經出現另一間誒呢兩間利潤變成兩間都虧損啦，誒呢一間利潤嗰一間虧損變成調翻轉啦，咁呢啲噉嘅動態嘅情況嘅時候，你又點樣去處理咧？所以我覺得即係阿秘書長講嗰個咧，好似係一個好誒合理或者好好好有。

435
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:57,720
理想嘅境界，但係去到套到入我哋實務嘅原則嗰度咧，呢啲又點樣執行咧？所以我就都希望，因為今日其實我覺得誒咁個咁多個專業團體點解我都聽曬咧，我哋覺得大家都係畀咗好多好誒誒有用嘅參考意見。但係喺呢一刻咧，因為我哋未收到政府或者誒即係財。

436
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:17,730
財富局啊、税局啊嗰邊嘅一個回應嘅時候咧，我哋只能夠就係就我哋感覺上到而家呢一刻。正如啊，主席你都講咗大為嘅兩個好重要嘅觀點啦。噉我但係我聽落啊，秘書長頭先嘅解釋咧，我都有好多仍然有好多疑團咧。我希望就話，如果秘書長可以更加詳細咁將佢頭先講嘅。

437
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:37,740
嘢能夠説服到我哋咧，噉我哋下一階段咧，再睇下我哋嘅心中本來仲有本來七八個問題嘅。咁但係好似頭，即係秘書長有啲問題咧，就係將會去處理或者將會咧畀個解釋我哋嘅。咁所以喺呢刻我又唔想咧即刻提出嚟，噉啊等到啊，我諗政府當局咧畀翻一個回應。

438
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:57,750
畀所有專業團體睇下嗰啲回應咧，能唔能夠滿足到我哋，即係解釋到我哋心目中嗰啲疑團先咯。唔該，主席。嗱嗱嗱，阿陳議員嗱，首先咧，我我想問一問兩位委員咧，你哋有冇啲問題想我哋嘅專業團體嘅代表啊澄清先？

439
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:26,150
誒嗱，第一個問題，我想誒大家頭先都講到咧，就話滿足呢個要求嘅誒，似乎嗰個緩衝期或者時間仲未夠嘅。咁頭先啊，秘書長都阿黎秘書長都都誒承認咗會去答應去誒重檢啦。噉我想睇下啲團體會覺得即係合理嘅時間應該係幾多？

440
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:19,860
係李小姐，好唔該曬，主席係啊陳議員係。我就你頭先個問題，或者將呢個嘅誒國際嗰個嘅標準同大家分享一下，好唔好啊？因為其實喺呢個嘅誒O E C D呢個Beps呢個環節裏邊咧，其實咧有三層啦。咁其實誒基本嚟講咧。

441
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:39,870
如果我哋香港政府能夠跟從翻嗰個嘅標準嘅話咧，其實喺個國際水平嚟講咧，已經係視之為比比較合理嘅。譬如乜嘢咧，就係主文黨其實喺誒O E C呢個準則裏邊都有有核定嘅，就係話可以容許喺嗰個課税年度嘅之後嘅十二個月嚇。

442
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:59,880
咁所以而家其實咧，我哋周邊唔同嘅國家，譬如中國啊，誒或者其他東南亞國家或者歐美咧，都係跟從呢個十二個月嘅時間可以容許畀集團去準備佢嘅主文黨。咁而呢個本地文黨呢方面咧，亦都係有個慣例啦，亦都係O E C D有一啲嘅誒指引啦。其實咧。

443
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:19,890
就可以跟隨話係申報嘅時間去準備嚇，咁即係其實咧，亦都有足夠時間。今日我哋而家見到呢個草案咧，似乎咧就係比呢兩個嘅時段係早咗嘅。換言之咧，就係喺我哋未申報我哋嗰個嘅税表咧，就已經要準備好我哋嗰份嘅本地文檔。其實係。

444
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:39,900
頗為苛刻㗎，係仲冇其他團體有補充嗱。如果冇，我不如畀個機會政府簡單回應咗呢一個嘅誒準備嘅local file同master file呢個問題先啦。好簡單回應，跟住我就畀阿周浩鼎議員發問。阿阿黎秘書長，唔該你嚇。

445
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:59,910
主席，我諗我頭先都好聽得清楚頭先在座朋友嗰個意見㗎啦。誒，我諗我哋最緊要就係符合翻經合組織O.E.C.D.嘅要求，就係話嗰啲誒超級跨國大公司，香港可能講緊百零間啦，嗰啲需要做嗰個個別報告country-by-country reporting嗰啲嘅話咧，梗係要準時交。

446
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:19,920
交報告啦。只要我哋自己本身香港嗰啲公司要應合翻O E C D經合組織個精神，要交嗰個即係master file或者local file主體檔案或者本地檔案嘅話咧，我同意在座誒嗰啲朋友講，包括頭先阿阿阿Sister所講嘅話咧，我哋應該係有空間係將嗰個。

447
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:39,930
即係準備期係誒，畀多少少時間佢公司嘅。我諗最緊要個原則就係話誒，呢啲需要做嘅工作係係要做啦嚇。但係我哋要畀合理充足嘅時間，嗰啲公司做呢個，我覺得我哋係可以即係靈活彈性去去處理嘅嚇。呢個呢個我哋有信心做到。唔該你，阿周浩鼎。

448
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:59,940
議員，誒唔該啊，主席啊，唔好意思啊，因為頭先今日其實同一時間幾個會都開緊，咁所以我都係誒頭先中途入嚟嘅，誒當然多謝誒啲誒今日出席嘅代表畀咗好多寶貴，而我其實都一路攆緊你哋嗰啲文件啊，咁誒嗱，我唔係搞税務嘅，雖然我係律師。

449
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:19,950
但係我就唔衰望，我亦都唔係我嘅個範噉，我亦都冇一個會計背景。如果我講唔啱咧，大家即係可以糾正我啦。誒，我睇到咧誒，今次咧有啲文件其實裏面誒亦都有一啲嘅觀點咧，我覺得真係值得畀政府去嚟諗清楚㗎啦。第一咧就係頭先嗰個轉讓價格嗰啲。

450
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:39,960
文件嘅交付嘅時間嗱，其實我睇到有啲誒今日入嚟嘅意見書都講咧，就話即係嗱誒六個即係一個嗰個會計嘅年度六個月內就要去做啦。咁但係我頭先又聽到原來即係有代表講其他國家十二個月先交，即係嗱。

451
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:59,970
我記得啊，主席，我坐過打擊洗黑錢嗰條條例啦，即係大家如果有印象，我覺得係你都喺嗰度啊，主席嗱，大家on the same page。即係我覺得咧，我哋做呢啲嘢咧就按照國際標準咧就需要，但你冇必要做多過佢要求嘅，即係人哋國際標準要求你係噉。

452
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:35,430
或者畀專人等等答話係咪對呢度六個月或者十二個月？你係點樣嘅嗰個考慮？另外一樣嘢咧，我其實都有睇有啲文件裏面講咧，就提到嗰個又係嗰個誒transfer pricing documentation，即係嗰個轉讓價格個嗰個文書嗰嗰文檔嗰樣嘢。嗱，其實咧有一啲嘅意見咧。

453
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:55,440
我今日見到寫出嚟咧，就係話誒有啲其他國家，包括新加坡嘅做法咧，就係佢係即係可以所謂嘅roll forward，即係意思講，即係如果你冇乜嗱，我唔知有冇理解錯啊。如果會計嘅專業，你糾正翻我嗱。假設佢冇乜特別嘅改動，或者中間唔係有啲咩好特。

454
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:15,450
大幅嘅喐動嘅話，係咪年年或者係每一個期間一個階段都要特登按照你哋規矩又做一次新嘅噉嘅咧？即係如果你話人哋，即係我唔知我有冇理解錯啦。如果假設喺其他人哋嘅國家係話冇乜特別嘅改動，冇乜特別嘅喐動，你係可以將之前嗰個就照。

455
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:35,460
翻就算啦，你唔使特登再做一轉。噉我唔知道即係誒局方係咪點樣考量呢樣嘢啦，因為誒我冇呢個會計嘅專業嘅knowledge嘅嘅知識嘅。不過我睇嗰啲文件裡面寫咧個精髓講得簡單啲咧，就係如果你越能夠講真即係可以慳。

456
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,750
後咧，我哋就簡單。

457
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:30,870
大同埋佢究竟呢啲嘅關聯交易多唔多啦？就係唔一定係要做幾十張紙嘅話咧，呢個我諗好視乎嗰個個別公司嗰個情況。

458
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:28,750
好明白咧，需要去監管，需要去執行，呢個係必定嘅，因為亦都係O E C D對我哋嘅要求。噉啊，問題可能就喺個執行上面，睇下有冇辦法可以誒有翻少少嘅空間。

459
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:15,140
就噉，你唔使特登做得佢再嚴苛啲啊！突顯自己特別巴閉啊！即係我覺得呢個真係唔需要嘅。如果你話其他國家都係十二個月，我就冇不必要要搞而家六個月啦。五亞八C嗰度就講而家話六個月喎，咁咁即係你你你又或者啊？

460
01:35:49,060 --> 01:36:04,770
誒點解我哋文件入邊提畀六個月時間啲誒公司製造咧噉嘅樣？其實我哋都有個考量喺度，或者一陣間我坐可以請啊税務局副局長趙生所講講解翻畀大家聽。其實我哋係有個有個出發點喺度嘅，同人哋係唔同。不過我哋。

461
01:36:45,070 --> 01:37:01,720
組織O.E.C.D.所提及有關嗰個主體檔案，或者係嗰個本地檔案嗰個範本嗰個即係model text嘅話咧，都應該會明白，其實誒，好似頭先誒阿李小姐所講嘅話咧，如果一間公司，

462
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:33,480
好多浸咧噉，我唔知係咪咁咯。好啊，周議員，不如我哋請啲professional，不如啲代表講下外國嗰啲例子，嗰啲file係咪可以roll over？如果冇咩substantial change，跟住我就請政府回應，好唔好啊？誒，邊位可以解釋下同我哋有冇？

463
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:55,470
翻人哋一啲嘅誒應對嘅成本咧，噉啊樣樣都好做啲咯。因為始終好老實講，站在我哋香港一個國際城市嘅立場，我哋都希望有個好嘅營商環境。但係咧，我哋成日都講，如果你啲例做到矯即做到矯枉過正咧，你最後啲成本就轉嫁喺。

464
01:32:55,470 --> 01:33:15,480
所有嘅公司嘅身上，噉啊，其實最後就係打擊翻我哋自己嗰個營商環境啊，所以即係呢度我又想問下，係咪真係可以話，即係某啲功夫其實可以慳得嘅就慳啦，唔使話都要人哋某個時段你又要再交，就其實人哋冇冇改過冇喐過，噉你又何必再做？

465
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:57,040
Sylvia，你係咪想繼續講？唔介意咁之其，你唔介意嘅話，如果其他人唔介意，阿Sylvia，你你繼續講。嗱，或者簡單介紹下啦。誒，其實咧做呢啲嘅誒TP民黨啦嚇，轉入定價民黨咧，其實喺執行上咧，我好明白咧，從政府角度咧，佢係需要每年執行嘅嚇，即係話其實因為呢啲價格。

466
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:17,050
咧每年都會有變動噉，但係簡單講，如果你第一年已經準備咗嗰個嗰個框架啦，其實咧每年咧去所謂做嗰個叫做嘅誒更新咧，其實都唔係太困難嘅嚇。咁但係至於話嗰個國際標準咧，係需要每年去準備。不過咧，我諗嗰個重點咧就係睇翻喺個準備。

467
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:37,060
當中嚇，其實個意義何在啦？因為咧，誒，好似之前我哋都提過咧，如果係一啲嘅純粹係香港境內，而係並沒有一啲嘅特別嗰個所謂有效税負差異嘅情況下，每年去噉樣去做一份嗱，其實咧，雖然誒，O E C D之前有嗰啲。

468
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:57,070
啲意見不過收尾都冇話係好官方噉樣提到呢啲嘅文檔咧。其實主文檔誒本地文檔各自咧，通常咧最簡單，基本上或者可以問下其他行家咧，都可能係三十至五十頁紙，未計附件，計埋附件可能去上到七十至一百頁紙。噉你可以想象話，如果係一啲。

469
01:34:57,070 --> 01:35:17,080
淨係境內互相雙方同年都係有利潤嘅，都係立緊十六點五嘅税率嘅企業，其實係咪真係有需要每年去做兩份嚇？加埋其實百企業紙噉樣嘅一個文檔咧，我諗呢個我哋都希望誒政府再考慮一下，或者睇下有冇少少嘅空間去寬鬆。我哋。

470
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:49,060
或者仲有冇其他團體或者專業團體想有補充？如果唔係，我就請請阿麗秘書長，你簡單回應下先啦。唔該，好誒，唔該，主席，多謝阿周浩鼎議員嗰兩個意見。就誒，講到頭先提及到做嗰個本地檔案啊，同埋主體檔案方面。

471
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:25,060
願意聽大家嘅意見，睇一睇我哋有冇啲微調嘅空間噉樣樣。第二方面咧，就頭先啊啊周議員提及到就話啲公司喺做呢啲噉嘅文書檔案嘅時候，如果佢嗰個業務或者係誒誒誒誒公司性質冇乜特別大嘅嗰邊，係咪需要每一年真係做咧噉樣？咁的確誒。

472
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:45,070
誒，即係從誒經合組織（OECD）或者係税局而家係管理嗰個，即係誒利得税誒報税嘅過程入邊嚟講嘅話咧，都的確真係需要啲公司每一年去做呢一啲噉嘅誒文書嘅。咁但係嚟講嘅話咧，我諗在座啲朋友如果有睇過誒經合。

473
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:56,850
呀。

474
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:55,930
Mr. Richer.

475
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,890
如果真係跨國企業，

476
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,860
彈性去保持嘅可以。

477
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:53,940
朋友有冇一啲係？

478
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:28,220
That taxpayers want to to use, having some kind of certainty of pricing on a on a fixed basis, which compensates costs, is the norm. As to the specific pricing.

479
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:51,550
譬如話啊加拿大、澳洲啊英國，如果做一個advance pricing agreement，佢哋嘅税務當局係點樣去去去收錢嘅咧？其實啊，可唔可以畀個資料我哋啊？誒唔好意思，我啲暫時而家冇呢個資料，唔知其他行或者其他嘅係啊。

480
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:22,010
佢個業務冇重大改變嘅話咧，佢可能即係每一年都係講翻同一個資料。因為譬如，如果我舉個例子啦，睇翻嗰個即係誒誒主體檔嘅master file嚟講嘅話咧，第一部分就講嗰個公司架構，第二部分就講佢嗰個公司業務。咁理論上，如果一間公司佢個架構或者佢個業務係冇變嘅話，

481
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:42,020
咧，佢真係可以五年十年都抄翻上年嗰個嚟嘅。但係我哋都唔知道佢會唔會真係有啲新嘅業務真係做咗，有啲新嘅資料要話畀大家聽噉樣樣。咁跟住喺嗰個誒誒誒飯本入邊嚟入入邊亦都有提及到，就話佢同一啲相關公司嗰啲即係財務交易啊，或者係佢本身。

482
01:37:42,020 --> 01:38:02,030
新個個公司對於轉讓處理啲轉讓定價嗰啲政政策嚟講嘅話咧，呢啲其實應該唔變嘅。呢啲可能係連一樣佢可以即係用得翻佢以前嗰啲嗰啲誒誒誒嘅嘅嘅嘅returns啊。不過如果講到話個別嗰啲交易嚟講，假如佢上年同啲關聯公司做咗十個交易，今年做咗兩。

483
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:22,040
兩項嘅話咧，咁呢啲就真係即係一啲具體嘅嘅改變，佢就真係可能要喺某一年嗰個誒報表嗰邊去反映翻呢啲即係誒誒事實啦。咁所以我諗其實誒從個公司嘅角度嚟講嘅話咧，真係好視乎翻佢嗰個業務有幾改變得。

484
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:51,290
阿趙副局長，你有冇補充？多謝主席，或者就各位在座嘅朋友提出嘅意見，我作一個簡單嘅解釋啫，或者叫做啊，嗱，對於點解喺個草案裏邊咧，我哋用咗係六個月做一個要求咧，其實香港同其他好多嘅外國税務管理。

485
01:38:51,290 --> 01:39:11,300
佢有一點唔同嘅，喺好多外國税務管理區咧，佢哋嗰個所謂報税嘅機期咧，都係十二月三十一號嘅。我哋香港咧就有一定彈性，其嚴格嚟講，任何一日都得嘅，即係你可以揀六月三十號得，三月三十號得。咁所以喺設計嗰個法例嘅時，

486
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:33,180
中間落物就六個月啦，咁個目的係咩咧？維持現有嘅彈性，亦都希望可以滿足到我哋香港嘅CBC第日嘅partner。如果提出問，我想睇睇香港嘅誒本地嘅主體檔案或者誒master file local file，我哋都可以交到出嚟。其實一個。

487
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:53,190
用意係噉，不過聽完啲係業界嘅嘅問題就話可唔可以多啲有多啲彈性？其實遞交呢啲個master file同logo file，我哋其實預計嘅時間咧都係交利得税報税表嗰個時候㗎。咁呢點咧，我諗我哋可以再考慮下，睇有冇加強嘅彈性。

488
01:39:53,190 --> 01:40:13,200
喺度，其實背後嘅原因係咁解嘅。第二個問題就話，可係咪真係事必年年要做咧？我諗，正如秘書長講過咧，就好視乎嗰個跨企業本身啦，嗰個規模同牽涉到嘅相關嘅嘅關聯交易有幾多啦？嗱，如果你話咁啱嗰個企業。

489
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:33,210
真係冇改變嘅。我諗佢畀翻上年嗰份，我甚至同我講話：喂，誒，税務局，我哋冇改變過。噉我諗，我我接可以會接受佢呢個陳述。噉我諗亦都足夠㗎。咁當然咧，如果跨國企業嗰啲咧，真係會好多改變。但係我亦都要指出。

490
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:55,180
香港唔叫佢交，我諗第二度某個税務管轄區都要求佢交，因為個主體檔案咧往係全世界嘅，咁而嗰個本地嘅檔案咧就主要係香港同其他世界嘅關聯企業嘅交易㗎，咁所以咧我估咧對於細嘅企業嚟講咧，我哋係好大嘅。

491
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:17,490
噉就誒就呢兩點咧，噉啊主席，或者我哋喺第日嗰個書面回覆嗰度，再畀誒更加詳細嘅諗法或者解説咧。好啊，我有一個問題，我問之後，即係可以隨便去去答一答我。記得就誒阿何生啦，澳洲會計師公會何阿何生就講過。

492
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:43,070
嗰個情況應唔應該作出一個收費嘅服務嘅？

493
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:13,310
因為我哋簡單嚟講，亦都唔可以話拒絕納税人。喂，誒，你我我要申請。

494
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:11,400
個方法去先行一行噉就過往經驗咧，就係one to零。我諗我哋税局喺執行嗰陣時候咧。

495
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:46,860
各方有冇補充啊？主席或者咁講法咧，就係其實誒講到呢個預先定價安安排呢個advance pricing arrangement嗰個收費咧。

496
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:38,460
I'll do a survey for you quite easily, just to see the the range of prices. But I'm not aware of any countries that are doing variable hourly pricing. Thank you.

497
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:58,400
政府或者税務局其實普早如之好簡單嘅啫，就係用者自負，跟住收回成本。嚇，我哋冇諗住牟利或者冇諗住諗其他嘢嘅。只不過一樣嘢就係話喺實現呢個。

498
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:26,470
我税局可唔可以話我唔做你個呢個申請？如果佢有合理嘅理由、合理嘅理據，我諗我可以接受佢嘅申請嘅。所以而家咧，我估呢個係一個考慮多方面嘅因素之後作出一個決定嚟嘅。

499
01:46:51,700 --> 01:47:06,640
單方面決定到㗎，比方説我假設咁講，美國税局話要同我傾十round要去華盛頓，唔似喺華盛頓，噉我買機票我都唔夠㗎，咁所以呢個咧係我哋值得要諗清楚嘅問題嘅。

500
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:37,500
我話喂，誒好多國家做呢個advance pricing agreement嘅時候，都係一個即係誒fix咗嘅amount嚟嘅，就唔係好似香港噉，即係香港即係我哋都水浸啦，仲即係仲要咁多錢嚟做咩？其實咁究竟佢哋嗰個嗰個fee係誒嗰個range係點樣樣嘅咧？即係比如。

501
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:17,200
Yeah, I think the issue, sorry, with the variable pricing is it's just very difficult to try and understand how much an overall APA will be. APAs can the length of it can be dependent on how many rounds of negotiation you have. What we were thinking about were three tiers.

502
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:37,210
Of pricing, if at a pre-filing stage you can identify that something simple, medium or complex, we can have a range of pricing for each of those. But to have something which is open-ended in pricing, it gives a lot of uncertainty as to whether a taxpayer would want to get into this arrangement or not.

503
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:57,220
additionaly the point as to this is a service to the taxpayer i think if we can also flip it around there's a lot of investment decisions into Hong Kong where tax is one of the factors in terms of whether we want to invest in Hong Kong or not a lot of certainty around tax is one of the the the factors in there where

504
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:17,230
一個Taxpayer會 want to understand， should I do this in Hong Kong？ should I do it in Singapore？ should I do it elsewhere？ This is also certainty to theIRD and to the government as to whether we will get this investment and what will the outcome be of it。 So to create an APA environment which is competitive and is something

505
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:18,960
誒誒目標嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，即係假如如果我哋唔係收回成本嘅話咧，就變咗係所唔係香港間公司收回成本嘅話咧，就所有香港納税人就有份走去津貼呢一個噉嘅即係服務噉嘅樣。咁大家又要諗下呢個係咪公道咧？或者我可以請啊，税務局嘅副局長啊，趙生，因為佢喺A P A嗰方面都有好。

506
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:38,970
好多嘅經驗點解今次我哋改變咗收費安排？趙生唔該你誒，多謝主席嗱。或者簡單咁講啊，現時咧，税務局做呢個A.P.A.咧，就冇一個法律基礎去收錢嘅，就簡單嚟講係免費嘅。咁呢樣嘢咧，我諗雖然做咗一段日子，我諗今日都係你話重新檢討。

507
01:44:43,350 --> 01:45:03,360
咁現時喺個税務條例裏邊咧，有個有一個我哋叫做advance ruling嘅，咁呢個程序咧已經有，亦都係有一個收費，咁亦都好多年冇作出檢討。我如果記憶所及，成十年有多嘅。咁今次我哋個草案咧就一次過啦，就advance

508
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:23,370
嗰度嘅收費重新檢討，就用咗呢個我叫做誒嘅收費嘅標準嘅scale啦，咁都用埋喺APA嗰度，噉係等佢一致嘅。嗱，如果用過往做advanced schooling咧，基本上比較簡單嘅工作嚟嘅，而APA咧相對係複雜性嘅，咁正如。

509
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:43,380
頭先誒朋友講過，可以係好簡單，亦可以係好複雜㗎。嗱，有一啲國家嘅收費咧，一開始個fix fee，我哋留意到咧係相當高㗎。咁嗰啲國家通常本身係一個比較，我我形容啊，叫做啲工業強國或者金融大國。噉佢哋跨國企業咧係規模。

510
01:45:43,380 --> 01:46:03,390
相當大噉，所以個fixed fee咧，一開始咧係可能係講緊港紙誒五十萬嘅，講緊係噉啊。咁有一啲咧有一個fixed fee就再加一個variable嘅fee喺度嘅，咁好多個組合都有。噉我哋而家香港喺呢個草案裏邊提出嘅意見咧，都係用翻at one ruling嗰個。

511
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:31,690
誒，我哋都好剋制嘅，就我話即咁形容我哋嘅。我哋冇攬收過呢個費用嘅，因為點解其實我哋都係好似咁講，都好似要打住張卡要clock住timing嘅。噉我哋都要對得住納税人，噉啊等人哋清楚知道我哋嘅工作係值得。

512
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:51,700
畀一個合理嘅費用嘅噉，只要話喺未來嘅日子咧，我諗我哋同政策局都會定時睇住個情況發展，睇下需唔需要有一個誒業界相關，或者唔知有個cap啦。咁但係最大嘅問題咧，因為A P A咧唔係話香港税局可以。

513
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:22,380
係。

514
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:24,460
誒，多謝主席。

515
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,390
開麥，開麥，唔該嚇。

516
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,680
第三行第一個位嘅黃生。

517
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,030
咁呢個係喺個某程度上，嗰係唔公平嘅。

518
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:48,650
有冇擺落去即係考慮過咧？噉樣樣唔該。係啊，邊位答啊？

519
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:41,040
就攞唔到嗰個豁免，咁喺個情況之下咧，喺依個制度之下咧，係嗰啲納税人咧會畀多咗税嘅，因為豁免嘅話咧會將個收入減少。

520
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:22,920
內容噉，然後咧又聽下秘書長講，佢會唔會喺呢度做一啲即係考慮或者調整咧？噉樣唔該，主席。你講跨境工作嘅新縫税係咪？你講緊？邊位會熟悉呢個法則？阿Fergus係阿Fergus陳哥，你嚇唔該。

521
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:17,520
境外工作都好咯，都係要喺嗰個計税上高計出嚟，然之後計出個税負咧，就攞翻個喺境外畀嘅tax credit。噉嘅話咧，你永遠都要畀嘅，香港嘅工作一定要畀嘅。香港畀嘅工作可能比較嗰個嗰個嗰個誒編制税率咧，可能高到十七個percent嘅。

522
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:30,090
嘢咧係mix咗出嚟，咁變咗咧就喺新嘅制度之下咧，就係劃分唔好，唔好話分都好啦。總之香港就冇嗰個冇嗰個選冇嗰個選擇，畀唔畀一個exemption，畀一個豁免嘅嗰啲跨境工作嘅人士，變咗喺個徵税權之下咧，就已經係規限咗你一定要係攞嗰個tax credit。

523
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:46,770
明白嗱。誒，各位委員仲有冇其他問題問我哋嘅啊？啊，周浩迪，啊，兩位都有，不如我你你就直接向佢哋即係問咗先，跟住我就唔使即係讓佢哋逗留太耐。啊啊，陳議員先唔該你嚇。誒，我留意到咧，誒，而家個草案嘅效果咧，可能會影響。

524
01:47:46,770 --> 01:48:06,780
講到一啲跨境工作嘅人咧，佢嘅税務嘅選擇，即係等於冇得揀啦。以前有得揀，冇得揀。咁誒，頭先啊，秘書長嗰個説明裏邊咧，又冇喺呢一方面有著墨嘅。噉我想唔知可唔可以請即係誒專業界別啲人士咧，就喺呢度可以誒講多啲落。

525
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:50,970
係，多謝主席，多謝陳宇聽到個問題，誒，聽唔聽到？聽唔聽到？聽到，聽到。誒，我諗個問題係來自誒，以往嘅做法咧，係喺誒，或者根本個根本問題咧，即係我諗喺個DTA之下咧，即係嗰個税務協議之下咧，就係劃分徵税權嘅，而本土法例裏邊咧就係。

526
01:48:50,970 --> 01:49:10,980
係行使徵税權嘅，咁如果喺嗰個DTA之下咧，有個劃分徵税權嗰個嘢處理咗嘅話咧，咁嗰個香港嗰個政府嘅自主權咧，徵唔徵税咧就嗰個徵税權自轉，咁呢個係有喺度嘅，以前都有嘅，咁而家喺個規限之下咧，將嗰個徵税權同嗰個劃分徵税權嗰兩

527
01:49:41,330 --> 01:50:01,340
減少嘅話咧，到個到個程度嘅話咧，如果唔過個免税個税個人免税額嘅話咧，根本係根本係香港可能唔使畀税，或者畀税嘅話咧，嗰個所以邊際税率係好低嘅。嗯，咁但係如果唔係嘅話咧，喺嗰個D T A之下咧，佢係全部所有一齊計嘅跨境作誒境外經作工作同埋境。

528
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:42,930
主席啊，我想問一問，即係誒政府當局，我我哋呢一個誒噉嘅後果啊。咁其實O E C D，我諗佢哋國家之間都有啲跨境工作嘅人士咧，但係佢哋可能個問題冇我哋咁誒多。咁究竟喺考慮嗰陣時候，呢一個點咧有？

529
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:20,140
可以揀嘅，即係喺個D.T.A.本身。

530
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:26,120
香港又唔係跟個條約做個tax credit嘅，就竟然用一個exemption，又好似對我。

531
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:44,280
明白，阿陳議員唔好意思，我佔咗啲時間，你再冇其他。阿周浩鼎議員有冇問題問啲誒與會者先啊？

532
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:18,030
裏邊我哋香港採取嗰個立場咧，如果有雙重徵税出現嘅，而嗰

533
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:16,620
即係嗱，當然如果你用嗰個最最簡單OEC都係by credit method㗎啦，relief from double taxation in terms of salaries tax，咁亦都有冇DTA我哋同人哋簽咗係。

534
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:35,650
by exemption又得，by credit又得，又冇呢啲，或者根本就唔用credit，用by exemption。我我覺得，我我直覺上可能唔係冇添，可能根本。噉你可唔可以澄清下咧？嚇，我哋所有條約喺香港港方嚟講，全部係用credit嘅方法嘅。

535
01:53:46,460 --> 01:54:03,560
咁所以我哋就算係講個避免雙重徵税嘅解決方案咧，都係跟翻嗰個税務協議嘅安排嘅啫。個原則性就喺呢一度啦。明白我代阿陳振英做個follow up啊。誒，係咪所有D T A？

536
01:50:49,020 --> 01:51:09,030
趙生，趙生係，好多謝主席嗱。或者我簡單講講少少個背景啦。就香港現時同咧大大約係三十八個國家已經簽訂咗個雙邊税務協議㗎。咁現時仲有大概十份咧，十個談判係進行緊嘅。咁

537
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:38,320
誒而當事人就香港嘅税務居民，咁香港就根據個雙邊税務協議咧，係有一個責任要提供一個所謂誒double tax relief嘅用嘅形式，就一個抵免技術用語就一個tax credit嘅。咁呢個咧就喺我哋所有。

538
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:58,330
嘅雙邊税務協裏邊都寫咗落去嘅，係我哋香港一個承諾，我哋一定要噉樣做法嘅。咁而同我哋因為條約係雙方面嘅，而同我哋另外嘅條約方咧，差唔多大部分都認同。嗱，香港你進行呢個tax credit，我都肯。

539
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:18,340
做個tax credit，如果你香港肯用exemption，我亦都會肯考慮用exemption。嗱，我哋可以見到呢個係雙邊一個協議嘅。嗱，咁有一啲誒條約嘅方曾經同我哋提出問題，亦都就個別案件就話：，喂，點解你香？

540
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:46,430
嘅納税人不利，佢講緊啲噉嘅嘢嗱。咁條約嘅精神係在於咧，如果有一個雙邊條約有提到嗰個點樣去解除嗰個雙邊誒嘅雙重徵税嘅問題咧，我哋應該跟個條約本身呢個行頭，因為呢個就我哋一般喺技術用語就係。

541
01:52:46,430 --> 01:53:06,440
條約會優先treaty prevails個觀念啦。咁所以咧，我哋而家用緊嘅模式咧，基本上都係參照英國或者可以咁講啦。唔差唔多好多國家都係用呢個方式有雙邊税務協議嘅，就用雙邊去税務協議指定嘅方式去解除嗰個。

542
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:26,450
雙重徵税嘅問題，如果冇呢個雙邊嘅税務協議，你就用翻。如果你哋本地嗰個税務管理局有單邊嘅，你哋自己就用個單邊或者冇都得。個觀念上就係咁啦。咁其實而家我哋只不過係將嗰個國際嘅做法，亦都或者咁講，同我哋同我哋嘅。

543
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:46,460
税務誒協議嘅另外一方咧作出嘅承諾，要落實翻喺本地法律。咁其實現時個草案裏邊咧有一條叫做四十九一C嘅裏邊嘅內容咧，其實係講緊我哋香港承諾雙邊税務協議有關嘅條文會係優先。

544
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:17,960
呢個問題講咗好耐，我諗誒，如果真係仲有冇？

545
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:14,270
係O.E.C.D.白紙黑字一定要做嘅，呢呢個先係我個問題症結所在嗱。

546
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:46,250
對於我本會嚟講咧，係並非一條法律嚟嘅DIPN，只不過係誒税務局嘅執行指引。

547
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:36,980
聽到阿黎秘書長就話：啊，呢個係誒去誒體現翻過去十幾年喺個DIPN嘅嘅一個嘅誒一個措施，但係問題DIPN。

548
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:41,290
意見咧就表示咧，誒嗱，為咗將來要合乎嗰個主量定價嘅規矩啦，噉啊誒，最好就應該係要有一個而家有個法定要求咧，就要做個advance pricing arrangement，即係做嗰個預設定價嘅安排。咁但係關鍵咧就係。

549
01:54:44,760 --> 01:55:04,770
誒，其實我係一個general嘅提問嚟嘅，即係如果與會者想根據我呢個提問再發表意見，非常歡迎嘅。嗱，我我就一路喺度攆緊大家嗰啲意見書嘛。噉啊，其實咧我就又有啲問題又想請教一下啦，兩兩兩個觀點啦。第一咧就係我今日都睇到有啲誒與會人士嘅意。

550
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:24,780
件書咧都有提到咧，就係話其實嗰個轉讓定價呢個機制呢個規矩咧，就誒按照而家政府今次呢個標嘅出嚟咧，就係嗱，唔單止係嗰啲cross border activities咧，即係跨境嘅，當然要apply要要應用啦。但係連本地嗰啲咧公司，即係。

551
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:44,790
自己之間嗰啲啊，domestic嘅activities咧都要cover埋嘅。噉我亦都留意到咧，其實有啲與會者嘅書面意見都講得好清楚咧，就係話誒，如果跨境嘅當然就應該啦，因為呢個都係按照啊國際嘅標準去處理呢一個嘅今日嘅呢個嘅情況。

552
01:55:44,960 --> 01:56:04,970
但係誒要用埋轉讓定價嘅規則，要用埋落去本地嘅嗰啲交易，即係究竟即係佢哋都有啲質疑，就係話究竟誒係咪真係對件事有一定嘅幫助？又或者調翻轉，其實做呢樣嘢個幫助真正嘅幫助係咪真係咁大？但係你又知道。

553
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:24,980
咧會令到我哋又多咗好多嘅負擔嘅嚇，咁所以呢個提問即係我都希望，即係如果與會者有心想繼續講多少少，可以話畀我哋聽，或者間政府又可以有啲回應呢個第一點。第二點咧就係關於個預設定價嗰度咧，我都留意到有啲誒與會嘅者嘅。

554
01:56:41,570 --> 01:57:01,580
呢個預設定價嘅安排咧，如果按照而家可能文件裡面所講咧，都係話齋按時數去計嗰個成本啦。咁但係就有啲意見亦都喺意見書裡面反映咧，就係話誒噉樣可能令到有啲公司自己想去做呢個預設定價嘅安排，但係佢又擔。

555
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:21,590
擔心個成本會唔會啊？即係我無法估計究竟要用幾多成本去做呢樣嘢。咁會唔會有啲意見就話，不如你將佢誒某程度上將佢鞏固咗喺某一個嘅定價，即係個個意思，個個收費嘅水平。噉啊，等以後啲公司啊知道，嗱，如果我要做呢個預設定價安排，去做呢個。

556
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:41,600
評估咧，我頂多都係畀噉嘅費用嘅啫。噉啊，可能就即係消費者又好，或者啲公司又好咧，就得個清楚。噉我都想聽下，即係唔知與會者可能即係Further講多少少啊，定還是係即係政府嗰邊會唔會有咩嘅誒誒回應啦？就兩兩樣嘢嘅啫。兩個問嗱，第第一個，我諗第二個問題，頭先剛。

557
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:45,340
我嚟聽，即係讓我哋知道究竟係幾咁麻煩咧？對於一啲集團嘅公司，可唔可以講到咧？

558
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:08,450
識得好清楚，我想有一個問題追問咧，嗱，大家都睇到，如果係噉，係會製造咗好大嘅負擔嘅。

559
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:20,180
都係十十十零年嘅啫，都冇幾十年嘅。我諗即係去澄清，就算係要用呢一個Amstrong principle。

560
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:50,550
因為你喺個group basis係冇一個tax advantage，誒，亦都要做噉，亦都因為噉樣咧，係令到誒嗰個誒誒。

561
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:58,600
嚇！阿黃玉強先生唔該誒，好啊！誒多謝主席同埋阿阿周議員誒提出呢個問題，畀機會我哋再重新一次誒。

562
01:57:41,600 --> 01:58:01,610
剛剛即係團體同埋政府都講咗關於嗰個誒預設定價安排嗰個收費，咁亦都啊，税務局副局長講咗點解佢哋要收回成本，或者佢之前點樣做嗰個誒誒另外一個系統叫Advance Ruling。噉我我諗我我讓佢再。

563
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:21,620
思考下先，再答啦。呢個問題下一次誒，關於誒，當然我就聽咗好多。頭先好多團體都誒，好關注就係誒本地公司與本地公司之間嘅啲交易誒，要用翻嗰個轉讓定價安排嗱。實質上嗱，當然我亦都聽。

564
01:58:46,530 --> 01:59:06,540
誒，所以你即係我，我覺得你啊，阿黎副局長，我諗你都有一啲嘅工作要做，就係要去説服呢一個委員會點解你要用一條即係法例嚟鞏固翻你一個嘅誒所謂嘅執行嘅一個慣例。誒，而依個慣例就並非一定係。

565
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:38,470
比如可唔可以改佢啲例子？即係如果如果真係政府話：喂，你所有過咗個誒價值嘅誒所有嘅domestic transaction都要做個誒淨誒轉讓定價嘅誒計算嘅時候，有實際上會遇到啲咩困難？有冇一啲嘅例子可以話到畀我？

566
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:18,890
我哋團體啊，專業團體或者係喺啲商業嘅誒誒人士咧，都係反映咗呢個係誒係一個佢最大嘅擔憂嚟嘅，最大憂慮就係誒令到即係本土嘅企業。

567
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:38,900
即係完全係，譬如係冇跨國嘅交易，都因為呢條條例咧係造多咗好多不必要嘅誒誒compliance嘅burden。咁誒個原因就係因為係我哋今日都講係誒冇冇實質嘅利益嘅。

568
02:00:51,640 --> 02:01:11,650
税局咧，亦都要多咗好多嘅資源咧，係要去睇呢啲嘅誒檔案，即係佢呢個呢個呢個compliance。噉就算係講以前一路係話有呢一個所謂arm's length principle，一路都要做用DIPN誒嚟做。

569
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:40,850
都唔需要個T.P.Documentation嘅冇個民黨嘅要求嘅。咁而家嘅民黨嘅要求，正話都聽到阿Sister或者其他講者講係動節係幾幾十頁或者誒過百頁嘅。咁如果冇實質嘅利益或者係誒誒誒Revenue嘅損失。

570
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:43,600
using management services as a way to get a de facto consolidation.

571
02:07:56,390 --> 02:08:01,450
所以我 think 會 be 勢

572
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:57,370
又唔使提供，即係提供太誒增加太多負擔咯，畀一啲嘅中小企。好，唔該曬啊，李小姐啊，Anden Mr. Richard。

573
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:56,080
歧視點 of view， it's an EU anti discrimination perspective. That's why they have it， but in practice they don't enforce it， other than in situations where there really is a tax advantage being created.

574
02:01:40,850 --> 02:02:00,860
而需要做呢啲誒unnecessary嘅burden係咪值得咧？同埋誒，尤其是啲中小企咧，即係佢哋係冇我我哋而家定到嗰個threshold咧。雖然係話講二億已經增加咗，其實都係好低嘅。誒，對於誒好多嘅誒本土嘅企業。

575
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:20,870
噉我覺得呢個都係誒unnecessary嘅。噉啊啊，至於啊啊啊，主席話有冇一啲例咧？最簡單嘅例，如果我哋用用呢一個嘅TPU都可以apply喺啊，譬如intercompany嘅interestreloan咧，呢個喺好。

576
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:40,880
好多本地嘅企業咧，或者跨國企業咧，都係用一個interest-free loan嘅形式去做一個financing arrangement嘅。咁如如如果要apply呢一個TPU to呢啲嘅誒誒arrangement咧，就會令。

577
02:02:40,880 --> 02:03:00,890
到好多嘅公司咧，都誒會會代入呢一個嘅誒compliance嘅 nightmare嘅，我可以咁講。咁誒亦都要影響好大嘅。好，唔該曬啊，黃生啊啊，週週議員，你係咪係跟進呢一？有係啊，係啊，有一個跟進呢個追問嘅嗱，非常唔該啊，黃生解。

578
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:28,740
誒，我想問睇下與會者答唔答到我咧，就係我成日都講啦，唔好做多過人哋國際組織要求你嘅。你做到咁已經夠，你唔使特登做多過佢特顯自己好巴閉嘅嗱。誒，如果國際組織嘅要求係唔係對於嗰個轉讓定？

579
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:48,750
價嘅規則都係應用喺跨境嘅公司嘅嗰啲嘅交易上面，而唔係用喺本地公司同本地資公司之間嗰種嘅嗰種嘅交易。呢一隻係咪其實而家國際組織嘅要求都係咁㗎？因為嗱，如果國際組織嘅要求都冇話要。

580
02:03:48,750 --> 02:04:08,760
你運用埋喺嗰啲本地公司同本地公司之間嘅交易咧，我真係有啲坦白講，覺得冇乜必要納入埋去，因為噉樣你對嗰啲中小企嘅負擔成本嗰個compliance cost係好高喎。噉我想睇睇與會大會答唔答到我係咪國際組織啲要求係點嘅咧？係嗱，周議員，我畀啲即係。

581
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:28,770
平等啲，我畀與會者答完到，即係各方都要答翻嚟嘅，好冇？嚇，咁誒邊位朋友可以答到阿周議員嘅問題啊？舉一舉手，Celia，唔該你嚇，唔該。好，唔該曬。誒，我想跟住嚇。好簡簡單介紹下啦，其實而家呢個嘅誒OECD嚇，針對呢個。

582
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:48,780
嘅誒税基侵蝕同埋利潤轉移合不呢個嘅環節咧，其實佢真係要去打擊一啲所謂雙重或者多重不徵税嘅情況。嗯，嗱咁個問題就係到底香港境內嘅交易會唔會產生或者導致有雙重或者多？

583
02:04:48,780 --> 02:05:08,790
從不徵税嘅情況咧，呢個我哋唔可以絕對排除嘅，係有可能。簡單咁講，咁所以喺某程度上喺即係我好明白，即係喺執法嘅層面咧，係需要有一啲嘅誒規條嚟到去規範。但係我哋喺我哋嗰個submission上面嘅提議咧，就係話其實我哋。

584
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:28,800
只係需要將境內交易保留喺嗰個transfer pricing rule one個環節裏邊，即係話境內交易亦都係有一個噉樣嘅期望咧，係需要符合獨立交易原則。但係並唔代表境內交易必定要做嗰個文檔。跟住咧就將到嗰個舉證個權咧。

585
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:48,810
咧就交翻去畀納税人，到時如果税局係覺得有懷疑或者咩嘅時候咧，就由納税人去舉證翻點解覺得自己當時係唔需要做呢個文檔咧噉樣，即係呢個可能會係有一個比較誒靈活少少嘅方法，又可以滿足到我哋要符合呢個國際要求嘅一個方法。

586
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:20,110
I think the domestic transaction issues, there's very specific situations where there can be some manipulation using transfer price in a domestic situation. So, for example, if we are availing of one of the incentive schemes in Hong Kong which offer half the rate of tax, if we're having intercompany transactions with one

587
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:40,120
Company that is taxed at sixteen and a half and ones at eight twenty five. Then in that kind of a situation, you can create a Hong Kong tax advantage from a overall Hong Kong perspective, not an entity level. Additionally, we don't have a tax consolidation system in Hong Kong. And what you can see is a lot of taxpayers now are.

588
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:33,860
個避税逃税天堂咧，嗱我哋就真係好唔想畀人哋上江上線去對於香港個個明星係有呢啲噉嘅猜忌，咁所以我哋覺得透過呢一個機會，誒一拼去做埋呢一個。

589
02:12:14,190 --> 02:12:28,720
某一個税務管轄區有一啲特別優惠嘅税務上嘅優惠，佢必須嗰個優惠嗰個preferential tax regime咧，係需要受制於國際上認可嘅轉讓定價嘅規則㗎。

590
02:12:46,870 --> 02:13:01,860
我亦都好坦白咁講，誒，經合組織已經睇緊我哋嘅標一，我哋個public嘅document，佢已經係睇緊我哋㗎啦。噉就仲問緊我哋啲同事一啲嘅問題，噉我哋儘量去誒。

591
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:46,590
噉我亦都記得主席喺其他嘅草案委員會，你都提醒過我哋局方，喂，會唔會點解每一個特別嘅優惠都有啲轉讓定價條文咧？可唔可以用一個普遍性適用嘅？其實今日我哋正是落實緊主席畀我哋嘅意見嘅。

592
02:06:43,920 --> 02:07:03,930
If we don't have a consolidation system, then we don't have a consolidation system. So if you have one taxpayer that's a loss and another that's a profit, and you're trying to use transfer prices as a way to artificially get consolidation, then again you're trying to manipulate a system that we don't have in Hong Kong, no tax consolidation. So in those two types of situation

593
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:23,940
I can see where domestic-related party transactions there might be an interest to have it at at arm's length. But in a situation where you're purely from a Hong Kong perspective, no tax advantage, profit-making company, another profit-making company, both trading with each other and both paying taxes, then that is that there. That's just

594
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:43,950
Complete left pocket, right pocket, in that kind of a situation, then it's burdensome. If you look at other countries, in the US they look at domestic related party transactions when there are state issues, different transactions of entities with different states of different state tax levels. In Europe you'll get a lot of domestic related party transactions covered purely from a

595
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:21,840
the the Hong Kong tax advantage point from a Hong Kong jurisdiction perspective, not from an entity perspective. That way, you could get the loss loss-making profit-making situation and the incentive situation covered. 啊，局方有冇初步回應？啊，黎局長啊，李司長啊，唔該。誒，多謝主席，同埋多謝朋。

596
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:41,850
有嘅意見，誒，其實税局對於喺香港營運嗰啲公司，要求佢哋以一個獨立交易原則（arm’s length principle）做交易呢一個噉嘅原則嚟講嘅話咧，其實就一直以嚟都係有呢個噉嘅要求。我哋覺得呢一個要

597
02:08:41,850 --> 02:09:01,860
喺其他税務區都係誒實施緊嘅，只不過就好似頭先啊主席所講，就話我哋而家將一個即係部門嘅行政指引行咗十幾年嘅要求嚟講，就正式放入翻個法例嗰度，叫大家遵守嘅啫。噉樣呢個就清楚啲。咁可能有啲朋友就話：點解我哋要做呢一個工作咧？

598
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:21,870
主要有兩個考慮喺度。第一方面嚟講嘅話咧，我哋都覺得其實轉讓定價喺成個税務誒誒誒政策入邊嚟講，都係一個好重要嘅一環。咁所以都應該真係喺翻個税務條例本身去去清楚去表述嘅。同埋第二方面嚟講嘅話咧，喺

599
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:41,880
當然，我哋明白經合組織對於呢個BEPS侵蝕税基、轉移利潤呢個行動計劃，主要在擔心嗰啲即係誒雙重不徵税double誒double non-taxation，同埋就係嗰啲誒跨國公司會唔會真係有啲轉移利潤嘅行為咧噉樣樣。但係我哋亦都關注一樣嘢，就係假如公合組。

600
02:09:41,880 --> 02:10:01,890
組織或者其他即係歐洲聯盟方面，佢遲啲同我哋做一個peer review做復檢嘅時候，發覺我哋香港本身個税例係就係寫咗一啲有關即係譬如話誒個別報告country by country report嗰啲新嘅要求落去啦。咁但係最根本一個最核心嘅問題就係話：咦，轉讓定價我睇唔到喎，噉樣當然我。

601
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:21,900
我哋可以話畀其實我已經話咗畀誒經合組織聽嗱，你睇我哋嗰個部門指引啦，DIPN幾好啦噉樣。咁不過佢就會覺得咦呢個唔係法例要求噉。有啲機構或者有啲人士就可能會覺得香港對於轉讓定價或者獨立交易原則係咪睇得太過輕咧？係咪即係專登放鬆，令到呢個有機會成為一個？

602
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:54,150
所謂將誒誒誒轉讓定價去codify放翻入嗰個法例入邊，呢一個就係我哋即係希望達至嗰個目的嘅。同埋，在頭先在座朋友亦都講咧，就係話我哋完全同意一樣嘢，就係對於一啲本地企業一啲本地交易，如果大家公司都係即係係有利潤嘅話，咁嗰啲基本上係唔應該。

603
02:10:54,150 --> 02:11:14,160
佢有税務利益或者優惠，嗰啲唔係我哋嘅重點嚟。但係，如果喺某啲情況，即係譬如頭先我我所舉嗰啲例子嚟講，一間有利潤，一間有誒有有有虧損嘅話咧，可能係有個空間令到啲誒關聯交易係誒對於嗰個税負。

604
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:29,400
話呢啲反其實即刻適用於我哋嘅個案，但係呢啲位置係值得我哋要小心處理㗎。

605
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:29,930
調整唔係噉樣嘅做法，我要指出。事實轉用定價嗰個運用咧，唔係講緊一啲細銀碼嘅交易，一定係大銀碼嘅交易㗎。

606
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:40,260
嗱，但係亦都有一點咧，我哋要清楚解説畀外國嘅投資者話點解？點解唔解？外國對香港交易就受你嘅？

607
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:34,170
本税收係有影響嘅，咁所以我哋係特別關注呢啲事情。我哋唔係諗住叫水局查曬所有呢啲噉嘅，即係關聯交易去。只不過我哋都係一路抱住個有限資源，就集中翻喺嗰個風險評估方面做翻一個，即係誒選誒一一啲，即係誒針對性嘅嘅執法工作，或者呢一方面我都。

608
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:54,180
都請税務局嘅阿阿趙生去講翻，即係其實佢哋點樣睇呢個轉讓定價嗰個執行啊？係阿阿趙生，多謝主席，我係亦都多謝阿周議員嗰個提問，同埋議會畀朋友畀嘅意見啦。咁或者我講一講少少個背景嘅，其實誒經合組織嗰個税基侵蝕。

609
02:11:54,180 --> 02:12:14,190
同埋利轉移嗰個行動計劃裏邊咧，我哋香港係承諾咗最少做四個嘅，一定要做嘅嗱。其中一項咧就係所謂有損害性嘅税務税務措施嘅嗱。呢個項目咧點解會同呢個轉讓定價有關係咧？因為經合組織嘅睇法，如果

610
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:22,370
解説希望經合組織接受到我哋嘅處理方式啦，我要指出。另外一點咧，我亦都會指出，歐盟裏邊咧就好多成員國都查詢過我哋香港係唔係會跟從OECD嗰個轉讓定價嗰個指引，我哋叫做transfer pricing guideline。

611
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:42,380
T.P.G.簡稱為嘅噉，我哋香港嘅答覆係我哋嘅本土法例將會能夠落實到T.P.G.裏邊所有嘅要求嘅咁呢點，我哋都陳述咗㗎啦嗱。就有一個問題咧，都幾我見到似乎有爭論性嘅點解香港對香港嘅交？

612
02:13:42,380 --> 02:14:02,390
交易，所以我哋局方唔考慮下有少少豁免咧。咁其實我哋都睇過某一啲國家就呢一點嘅處理方法，我哋發現咧個情況咧就比我哋可能想象係更複雜。原因點解咧？嗱，因為第一咧兩個香港人。

613
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:22,950
我或者用噉嘅技術，兩個香港税務居民進行一個交易，嗰個交易可能喺境外進行嘅，係一批外國嘅貨物，係一個外國嘅物業，咁呢個算唔算係香港對香港嘅交易咧？喺定義上咧，我諗我哋要好小心處理，亦都因為。

614
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:42,960
係香港地域來源嘅原則啦，咁要決定係咪香港對香港交易啦，似乎情況係比較複雜，比其他國家來得複雜。咁另一點，我哋亦都考慮過其他國家嘅處理方法，比方説英國啦，佢最初真係侷限咗係同境外嘅交易㗎，後尾佢都擴充到包含埋。

615
02:14:42,960 --> 02:15:02,970
境內即係英國對英國嘅交易㗎。頭先議會長有提出都指出嘅喺歐盟裏邊咧，因為由於嗰個反歧視嗰個問題咧（discrimination, anti-discrimination），佢哋而家歐盟整體嘅轉讓定價嘅法規係適用於整個歐盟內部一切嘅交易㗎。

616
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:22,980
嗱噉，我哋香港當然唔係歐盟，亦冇可能係歐盟一部分啦。但係呢個都係一個國際嘅標準，亦都我哋需要參考㗎。而我哋嘅雙邊税務協議裏邊咧，其實都有啲反歧視嘅條文㗎。我哋就WTO都有一啲commitment係反對歧視嘅。當然，我唔係。

617
02:15:40,620 --> 02:16:00,630
誒轉讓定價法規監管，而竟然香港對香港，你純粹本地嘅嘢就冇，點解要加重我負？加重有不同嘅對，即係對處理方式。噉我諗都有一個好嘅説法嘅。咁議會即係亦提到啦，就算就本地嘅交易，我哋而家有啲我哋叫做誒交。

618
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:45,680
多謝曬。

619
02:21:46,770 --> 02:21:54,250
都係咁做嗱，當然你話你到時執行嗰陣，你會睇得好鬆啦。咁但係個問題，你法例就法例啊嘛，你寫咗落去佢就要。

620
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:44,460
回應你可以上公眾席繼續聆聽噉，但係我就可以即係讓你哋即係翻去做翻你哋嘅誒事務啦嚇。唔該曬，唔該曬，各位先係。

621
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:46,400
文書上有闊免嘅時候咧，你就明明確確咧就擺翻喺呢個條例度，即係講緊誒誒本地公司與本地本地公司之間嘅交易嘅文書嘅一個誒，即係報表啊等等嘅。

622
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:20,640
全税税率嘅full rate嘅regime，有啲有半税税率嘅嘅交税嘅制度，half rate regime嘅，甚至有啲係唔使交税嘅。咁好似梁國雄議員剛才都提過啦，喂基金好似免税㗎。咁其實我哋有三種情形㗎，如因為有税率嘅。

623
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:40,650
差異咧，所以我哋需要將個轉讓定價有有關嘅條文係失願於喺香港對香港嘅交易呢個，其中亦都係一個原因㗎。嗱，不過無論點，我聽咗各位在座嘅朋友嘅意見喺實際執行運作嗰度，我會認同喺決定應唔應用嗰個轉讓定價有關嘅條文。

624
02:16:40,810 --> 02:17:00,820
喺本地對本地交易嘅，我哋嘅做法一定會審視整個誒香港牽涉到嘅税負，即係用一個用翻英文嗰個Hong Kong Tax Advantage，好似一個group噉樣，有冇呢個現象？嗱，考慮呢個因素嘅時候咧，我哋會睇樣樣嘢啦，嗰個税負係咪無？

625
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:20,830
限期defer permanent嘅timing difference，或者係短暫性嘅deferal，咁銀碼牽涉到嘅係幾多動機、目的、後果會點？即係我哋考慮啲因素。噉我所以指出咧，就係話唔係話税務局執行落實個法規嘅時候，係冒冒然就每一個香港對香港嘅轉讓都作出。

626
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:50,380
咁主席，我今我暫時咧就畀住咁多嘅解釋住，希望議會嘅朋友都明白政府係有一定嘅原因，所以作出呢個提議咁解嘅。係啊，副局長嗱誒，副局長當然提提及我喺好多初選委員會，我做主席嘅時候都都都提點過你哋關於主。

627
02:17:50,380 --> 02:18:10,390
嘅誒轉移定價呢一樣嘢啦，但係我諗與會者關心嘅就唔係話將個啱先principle去啊應用喺啊本地同本地之間嗰個公司嘅交易。咁呢一個原則咧，我諗大家都冇去反對，只不過係喺嗰個。

628
02:18:10,550 --> 02:18:30,560
啊，合規嗰度即係話，你做個filing嘅時候，你有冇考慮下嗱？當然你可以用DIPM或者執行嗰時去做啦。但係我諗大家都係一個即係非常奉公守法嘅專業人士啦。我希望如果你係諗緊一啲嘅，即係喺誒文件上。

629
02:18:46,680 --> 02:19:06,690
嘅requirement，你可唔可以大刀闊斧啲咧？畀咗個闊面，而係有一啲嘅情況底下，你哋覺得嗯，又係有一啲嘅問題嘅時候，你就要佢做翻同埋去證明呢個係啱聲嗱。呢個嗰個方向咧，我諗誒喺如果。

630
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:26,700
correct me if I'm wrong，就喺內地嘅做法咧，都係係噉樣做法嘅啦。啊，呢個我意見啫。噉我知道周浩鼎員亦都有問題，你係咪要問我哋嘅專業團體，因為我可以放佢哋走啊？我攞問一問。誒，哎呀，噉我又死啦，hold住佢哋添，唔緊要，唔緊要，唔好意思。佢佢哋佢好願意即係再舉例嘅，我諗你繼續問一下。唔係因為呢？

631
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:46,710
呢個誒頭先啱啱碰到呢一個關鍵問題，我相信大家都關心嘅，即係阻咗你哋時間，對唔住誒！我只係我嗱，我或者我講多個意見就畀畀大家走啦，即係無謂阻住大家時間。嗱，我同阿主席嗰個睇法都有啲相似。嗱，我希望局方咧留意到咧，其實頭先與會代表。

632
02:19:46,710 --> 02:20:06,720
表可能啊啊，Sesilia，我個即係講佢講咧，就佢都解釋得好清楚。即係而家唔係，但係佢又明白到，或者我哋都應該咁講，我哋都明白到國際組織對我哋呢個法規嘅要求。誒，你要將佢納入一個法定嘅要求，亦都要全面地咁去做。

633
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:26,730
亦都要話畀展示畀國際經合組織聽，嗱，我哋有跟足嘅，噉我我明嘅呢樣嘢。但係大家都明咧，頭先有議會代表提得好清楚咧，其實主要你打擊同針對嘅對象就唔真係嗰啲本地公司同本地公司之間嗰啲交。

634
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:46,740
頭先我聽到有位與會者解釋啦，過去嗰啲，如果你喺其他國家嗰啲所謂本地公司同本地公司之間嗰啲交易，係因為佢一個國家裡面有唔同嘅税率，係咪？即係有啲唔同嘅州有唔同嘅税率係咁做啊嘛。但係你香港本身，嗱，當然頭先指出話係有，而家我哋十六點五又一隻八。

635
02:20:46,740 --> 02:21:06,750
檢驗啊！主席，我哋一齊有份做嗰啲標啲飛機租任啊，嗰啲又有啲新嘅可以交Half Rate係有噉，但係呢種情況亦唔係咁普遍，去到咁廣泛噉，亦都咁講咧。如果你話誒，我哋嘅主要針對嘅對象真係唔係呢啲本地嘅公司裏面嘅交易咧？萬一你話佢用呢樣，

636
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,650
多謝主席，多謝議員。

637
02:23:57,420 --> 02:24:01,550
其實誒，就經合組織都已經係。

638
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:25,790
係係結束咁亦都多謝誒各位委員嘅寶貴時間，多謝誒政府官員嘅時間，亦都多多謝各位同事，唔該曬。

639
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:41,160
誒，啊，頗為急嘅一條條例草案，因為我哋要去真係誒，要誒有個peer review，誒，幾時啊？幾月幾號啊？知唔知？我想問一問。

640
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:17,600
法程序，我都希望即係各方畀翻一個全面嘅誒書面回應。嗱，我下一次嘅開會日期咧係暫定咗喺三月六號星期二嘅下午四點半。三月六號星期二係阿周議員。

641
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:26,760
嘢去做一個漏洞咧，不如調翻轉頭咁講，會唔會你第一步做咧？人哋都人哋可能而家都唔係即刻同你講個豁免，佢只不過話喺個機制裏面稍為調一調轉，即係減輕少少佢嗰個嗰個compliance嘅成本，唔使佢做嗰啲filing嗰啲documentation。咁如果真係

642
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:46,770
有問題先至去舉證去查，噉你起碼咧就對於嗰啲本地公司咧，你起碼降低咗佢哋嗰個負擔，即係唔使個個都噉樣跟住去做。噉我覺得呢個都叫中間著墨啊。即係如果你話一下你真係要全部咁好似個條例咁納埋入去，全部法定要求再加埋你誒本地公司。

643
02:21:54,530 --> 02:22:14,540
佢真係要就要咁跟，即係所以，我覺得啊，主席，我都同意你個諗法咧。我諗即係希望局方你翻去，即係或者你有時間，你可以諗清楚咯，係咪真係要需要噉樣一步，或者scientific？如果你真係第一步，英國都係咁啦，你話齋係嘛？一開始唔係做到mass transaction先嘅喎，係跨境，後來。

644
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:34,550
佢可能做咗一陣，之後發覺有問題，再給法。咁人哋都有個時間啊嘛，係咪？啊，就係咁啦，係啦。周員，我你需唔需要佢哋回答啊？都回答咗好多次啦。噉我不如唔使。因為噉樣我啦，誒，我好多謝今日嗱，我我即係好多謝各位專業團體、各位即係與會者，畀咗好多寶貴意見。嗱，如果你哋想繼續聆聽呢個。

645
02:22:49,770 --> 02:23:09,780
嗱，各位委員啊，噉你哋仲有冇問題問啊？我我知道陳振宇係問咗啲問題嘅，其實即係你覺得局方答咗你個問題未咧？陳議員頭先，我唔好意思，我即係炒開咗，因為我就想將啲問題集中啊問咗啲誒專業團體先。阿阿陳議員，你有冇其他？唔係，我都係誒。

646
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:29,790
期待緊呢個局方咧嗰個書面回應之後咧，我哋可以誒根據個書面回應之後咧，再嚟跟進提問咯。唔該，好嗱。噉我諗喺當下咧，我亦都冇乜太多嘢要即係可以即係推進到嘅呢一條條例。即係雖然我都知道呢一條條例草案係。

647
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:21,880
即係睇緊我哋呢一個嘅條例草案㗎啦，即係好似頭先阿趙生所講，因為佢哋今年之內都的確係要幫香港完成我哋呢一個peer review。同埋，我諗點解我哋都心急咧？誒，咁頭先嗰啲業界朋友都會知道一樣嘢就係誒，我哋。

648
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:41,890
好老實咁講，我哋做呢個BAPS嘅收地條例草案嚟講，同其他國家地區比，我哋係算係慢嘅。內地已經做咗，頭先英國好多歐盟嘅國家已經做咗，新加坡二零一七年一月已經立咗法啦。咁香港係。

649
02:24:41,890 --> 02:25:01,900
少數未完成呢一個立法工作嘅噉，所以變咗喺嗰個即係國際事野方面嚟講，我哋都幾係焦點。點解我哋都希望能夠盡快去做好呢個工作？好唔該曬你，李處長。噉我諗咧誒，要盡快推進呢一個。

650
02:25:18,010 --> 02:25:38,020
主席唔該曬，我主要係一個問題嘅啫。嗱，因為我都留意到誒，其實就法律顧問其實有封比較長盡嘅書面嘅信畀咗局方。噉係咪下一次會議之前啊，佢都會有一拼有埋書面答覆嘅？你講緊係C B Cool一五八四。係啊，誒C B Cool一五八四一七一八零一個。

651
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:58,030
明白嗱，我我嘅而家而家即係誒嘅事態發展就係應該就仲未有一個誒書面回應嘅係咪啊？我哋處理緊嚇，你係處理緊嘅，所以呢一個嘅誒法律顧問呢一個嘅提出嘅問題咧，會都會喺一拼咧下一次。

652
02:25:58,030 --> 02:26:18,040
啊，會討論埋嘅噉，我亦都知道法律顧問亦都會有其他嘅誒問題，會再繼續向局方跟進嘅。咁希望三月六號之前，我哋收到你哋嘅書面的回應，亦都係可以喺三月六號咧，可以有一個比較詳細嘅一個討論。噉我今日咧就宣佈呢個會咧係。
