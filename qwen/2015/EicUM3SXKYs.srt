00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
今次嘅會議，第二次誒，二零一三年除害劑修訂條例草案嘅委員會嘅會議，就今早咧就誒。

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:20,590
我哋主要就係聽取呢一個團體嘅意見嘅，噉就誒今早有七位嘅人士啊，噉佢哋會嚟陳述佢哋嘅意見。噉我哋邀請我哋嗰啲團體代表。

3
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,970
歡迎各位誒團體同埋人士。

4
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:41,740
係誒誒歡迎各位團體嘅人士咧出席今次嘅會議，亦都歡迎政府嘅代表啦。噉就誒請各位誒代表咧就喺使用你嘅耳筒誒嘅用你嘅耳筒啦，帶著你嘅耳筒。Thank you for coming啊誒to these councils and please put on your earpiece啊，請大。

5
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:51,550
大家帶筒帶嚟嘅耳筒，噉就誒現場咧就係嘅版本就係誒零啊嚇，廣東話頻道就係一，咁誒英文嘅頻道就係二。

6
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,320
誒咁咧，如果大家發現嘅時候咧，請你將你哋個麥咧夾喺你個衫嗰度啊！嚇～

7
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,140
請你哋將你嗰個麥夾喺個衫度噉樣樣，噉就誒。

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,450
亦都請提醒各位誒，大家人士咧，就係你哋嘅發言咧，係。

9
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:18,710
並不享有《立法會權力及特權條例》第三百二章所定定嘅保障同埋豁免嘅。

10
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:34,710
Would you please put on your earpiece and your earpiece? Your earpiece is on the table, and also clip your microphones onto your.

11
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,360
啊！cloth， so that the。

12
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,360
When you speak, we can hear.

13
00:02:44,180 --> 00:03:03,020
OK，如果大家準備好咧，我哋就請誒團體發言。咁咧就誒請大家注意咧，我哋係誒由於誒誒我哋安排啦。噉我哋希望大家喺五分鐘內咧能夠完成你嘅發言。噉我哋第一位發言嘅人士咧就係公民黨嘅麥嘉慧小姐。

14
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,460
係，唔該，主席。

15
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:22,040
啊，首先，公民黨係啊支持呢個條例草案嘅。咁好等本港嘅誒對監管食物中殘餘除害劑嘅標準咧，就能夠同國際接軌啦。嗯。

16
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,710
噉啊！公民黨嘅健康生活及質啊，健康及。

17
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:46,090
生活質素之報咧就一路都好關注呢個食物安全嘅，噉啊，所以咧以下咧有幾點咧啊，公民黨就想提一提政府嚇，當呢個條例實施之後，可以做多啲乜嘢嚟能夠啊更加有效咁監監控一啲啊食物安全或者之類嘅嘢啦嚇。

18
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,240
嗱，因因為誒除害劑係一個屬於持久性有機污染物啦，噉佢係一個。

19
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,490
萬。

20
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:13,780
慢性毒性嘅誒，同埋會有呢個生物積累啦。咁喺環境中係又好難分解啦。咁所以啊，我哋已經知咧，就喺蔬果裏邊會用到嘅呢啲除害劑係五花八門。但係咧，現今嗰個國際咧係其實真係都未有一個好適合嘅誒。

21
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:33,790
科學方法去評估啊，呢啲唔同即係多過一種嘅殘餘除害劑，可能對人類或者環境帶來嗰個啊毒性嗰個混合效應啊。咁所以咧誒，我哋覺得咧政府係更加應該係加強個把關啦，啊要增加抽驗呢個蔬菜嘅樣本。

22
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:53,800
本啦，例如噉啊，保障市民健康啦。咁現時咧，我哋知道食物安全中心咧都有一個誒食物監察計劃嘅。咁雖然有定期抽查進口食物嘅殘餘農藥啊或者其他環境污染物之類啦，噉啊，但係都我哋都係覺得欠缺呢個透明度嘅。咁所以我哋會提議當局咧係能。

23
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:13,810
能夠啊，每年有一個真係詳細嘅報告，例如會誒列出曬所抽驗過抽驗過嘅食物嘅食品嘅種類啦、樣本嘅總數啦、所抽驗嘅污染物嚇，究竟係曾經想度過啲乜嘢咧嚇？因為有陣時我哋發覺，如果冇唔合格嘅咧。

24
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:33,820
我哋唔知道政府做過啲乜㗎，或者好難揾到啦喺網上面或者諸如此類。咁所以誒，另外咧，咁呢個年度嘅報告裏邊咧，當然會有涉及誒，究竟有幾多唔合格嘅誒食物嘅名稱啦、總數啦，同埋佢哋嘅來源地。咁呢個好緊要啦嚇，係咪嗯？

25
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:45,990
咁另外個報告，我哋都覺得唔應該誒好被動，咁純粹喺靜靜地喺網上發布啊，或者係印一啲細細張嘅小冊子啊，好少人去主動去攞啊，咁誒。

26
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,440
誒呢啲我哋係覺得係被動嘅媒介嚟，噉我哋覺得政府係應該誒。

27
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:02,700
有一個教育嘅方法就係會主動啲，用多啲嘅媒介，例如係電台啊、電視嗰啲廣播、廣播啊等等啦嚇。

28
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:09,050
咁另外我哋都覺得要強化一個誒通報機制啦嚇，誒。

29
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,930
誒，如果嚇我，如果本地係驗到一啲。

30
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,340
誒。

31
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,290
有害嘅物質嚇，誒誒誒。

32
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:37,370
咁應該係向個來源地通報啦，或者係誒我哋知道其實香港都同鄰近地區有好多誒聯係啊，噉我哋都應該要誒加強嗰個強化通報機制。我相信有，但係就唔係話誒誒可以可以做可以再做好啲嘅，跟誒我哋認為嚇。

33
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:57,960
咁另外誒，除咗食物安全之外咧，其實我哋都有留意到咧，市面上市民係好容易係買到一啲誒所謂家用即氣型嘅除害劑啊。咁有啲係俗稱炸彈噉樣。噉我哋知道有一啲市民咧係例如會中意誒每年會所謂大掃除一次咧。

34
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:17,970
就用呢一啲嘅除害劑噉，但係其實大家都知道啊，都係啊呢啲誒有機嘅化學物咧，即使係低濃度啦、低份量啦，佢哋始終都係喺個環境嗰度積累。噉我哋會提議政府應該係要誒要監管呢啲嘅產。

35
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,890
產品啦，喺個包裝嗰度，例如要嗯強調翻究竟呢啲嘅化學物嘅。

36
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:44,200
誒對人類或者環境嘅潛在風險啦，其實誒，所以一個inform嘅decision，究竟市民係咪真係必須要用呢啲嘅除害劑咧？誒，我哋認為係未必嘅嚇，因為有好多預防嘅措施，唔使畀呢啲害蟲啊或者之類嘅嘢咧，就喺屋企或者誒花園出現啦嚇，噉。

37
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:55,730
所以都係加強教育啦，誒，同埋要試下會喺嗰個市場度做一啲情報啊、資料蒐集啦，唔好太被動，等外地或者附近地區出咗事，我哋先要採取行動。呢個。

38
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:08,350
主要就係我哋公民黨對呢個條例嚇誒嗰個草案嘅意見嚇，多謝主席。OK，啊，多謝你。噉啊，下一位發言就係Mr. Paul Mills Melson。

39
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:16,810
You, you would like to use PowerPoint, right? But I'm sorry, you have you do have five minutes. Okay, how do I put this on, Dave?

40
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,730
嗯。

41
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,650
嗯。

42
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,110
我唔知。

43
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:40,440
This is my submission on pesticides. I implore you to read this and understand some of the serious health and safety issues linked to pesticides, especially facing children, and grasp the full severity of the situation.

44
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,490
我係一個英國大學培訓的園藝學者，和安全使用農藥。

45
00:08:44,860 --> 00:09:04,870
在plant nursery as well as in the UK experimental horticultural centre. I have been working in Hong Kong since 1997. I've used, I haven't used pesticides for 30 years because of their health risks. For the last seven years, I've been teaching organic eco education in Hong Kong. I have been appalled beyond belief by the complete lack of controls and guidelines for pesticides used in schools. These are, in my experience.

46
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:13,020
非existent， exposing children to some of the worst neurotoxic pesticides around， and seriously increasing their health risk for getting serious diseases in the future。

47
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:27,100
Many parents are deeply worried by this unbelievable situation. I have contacted relevant government departments on numerous occasions, and I have found the pesticide guidelines and risk assessment guidelines to be completely useless. I like to emphasise useless.

48
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,010
For comment, see slides 26 to 37 in the long version for the committee.

49
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:52,340
plants with recently this is plants with recently sprayed pesticide in the school you can see the pesticide clinging onto the leaf this is active for several days and the half life of some of these pesticides is 30 days these are neurotoxins I've actually had it on myself I've been to hospital I've had numbing on my arms and it's I've still got chemicals.

50
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,310
sensitivity now.

51
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:11,680
我要求立即懸停所有危險農藥，立即從學校使用。這些應包括神經毒素農藥，即係多環磷化物，包括代森胺。這其實代森胺其實已經被歐盟禁用，即係歐盟整體在去年3月因為太危險。

52
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:21,000
Review of pesticide use in schools. New enforcement measures must be introduced for pesticides used in public places, including schools, and with severe penalties for any breaches.

53
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,260
There should be full public engagement, education and consultation on pesticides.

54
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:43,440
pesticide-free schools. Hong Kong's aim should be for pesticide-free schools to ensure free schools to ensure the long-term health of children, staff and susceptible fetuses and pregnant women. New York and Connecticut campaigned and won a victory for pesticide-free schools in 2010. Please see the website.

55
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,430
innocent, inquisitive. This is my son playing around.

56
00:10:47,710 --> 00:11:00,900
They pick up pesticides in the new territories and in schools. As a parents, we should have the right to know what pesticides are used around our children and have a voice in protecting our children from these life-threatening poisons.

57
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:21,230
Many pesticides used in Hong Kong are banned or have restricted use and cannot be used in schools or domestic use in other countries. Pesticides are poisons. Pesticides are toxic poisons made in industrial factories to kill insects. The pesticide applicators in Hong Kong need no licence, recognised certificate or qualifications to spray hazardous pesticides in schools.

58
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:41,240
This is wrong. These people can actually come off the streets with no masks and get the concentrations completely wrong. They can be up to ten times the wrong concentration in the school, and there is no monitoring at all. Pesticides not only kill insects, they make children and people very sick. In some cases, terminally ill. Pesticides are known to cause many types of cancers, affect fetuses.

59
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,130
和孕婦，內分泌幹擾，那係激素系統、生殖系統，帕金森氏病。

60
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,360
注意力缺陷過動症。

61
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,590
Many studies list many cancers resulting from pesticide exposure, especially is concerned for children.

62
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:17,910
包括兒童和成年白血病、兒童腦癌、非霍奇金淋巴瘤，那係跟二噁英有關，係用喺學校，係可能用喺課室，喺事實上，係一個已經被歐洲禁用嘅物質。腦瘤、腦癌、前列腺癌、腎癌、胰臟癌和肺癌。雖然我讚賞政府提出要採納。

63
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,670
Stockholm Convention and the Rotterdam Convention on Pesticides. These fall a long way short of safeguarding the public and children from pesticides.

64
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:36,060
Diazinon, as I have said, is banned in 27 countries. This insecticide has been used in schools. There is no restriction of this being used in classrooms. This is appalling, unbelievable.

65
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:50,570
safeguard. There are safer natural alternatives should be sought for pest control. The government should adopt a much safer integrated natural pest control methods. There is a lot of things out there that can be used if the government did its research and development and didn't stop dragging its feet.

66
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,110
多謝。

67
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,700
Thank you。噉我哋跟住下一位係誒。

68
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:19,620
香港蟲害控制從業員協會梁廣源先生，誒多謝主席。誒，我都係代表我哋嘅畫牆或者我哋從業員啦。誒，可能而家市民有啲菜角，即係我講翻我哋環境衞生方面啦，嗰啲從業員啦。而家基本上好多核心分子好多年受過，如果我哋統計，而家我有。

69
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:33,760
大部分已經受過學院級嘅培訓，二十小時至六十小時，同埋我哋日常使用嘅除害劑，而家誒喺市民個誒大機構或者政府合約，好多都要求指定。

70
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,160
係你用咩除害劑，同埋要畀埋曬啲MS。

71
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,800
M.S.D.S.嗰啲物料安全規格啊，你點樣做啊？要寫得好詳細嘅。

72
00:13:42,090 --> 00:14:02,100
誒，如果話勾低嗰啲藥咧，好似大鈴蛇王啊、誒誒嗰類嘅藥咧，其實喺我哋業界已經誒唔係周圍有供應。講我哋業界意思誒，唔包作唔包括農作物係我哋環境衞生界嘅。而家大部分嗰啲老闆因為驚誒一個責任賠償啊，唔係驚法例，反而去。

73
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:22,110
經一個民事送狀啊，責任賠償啊，所以佢哋大部分都係偏向採用所謂我哋個除蟲菊脂嗰類比較對人畜環境生態誒影響唔係好大嗰啲誒誒藥物，同埋大部分嘅多數都用埋水性先，即係水溶性嘅，冇我驚，雙份喺裏邊冇揮發性嘅係比。

74
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:33,810
較安全啲嘅藥，同埋誒誒，基本上你話想買啲危險嘅藥，都唔係咁容易買到，同埋你又香港市場太細嘅，誒其實誒。

75
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:54,720
一般要我哋知或者我哋統計一大部分誒啲從業員，如果佢有機會做啲大嘅企業或者學校，尤其學校㩒，佢好緊張嘅嗰啲誒校長啊啲成，你用咩藥啊？呢補㗎，樣樣都提交畀佢啊！除非嗰間公司誒即係玩股劃啦，誒偷龍轉鳳咁冇得講。而家正常咧，而家學校一學

76
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:14,730
可能啲校長都意識到佢嘅責任啊，個人嚟噴殺唔死嘅責任，所以都要求業界，包括啲老闆好、前線人員好，你有冇讀過證書啊？有冇證啊？問長問短啊！雖然政府冇立法，佢哋都要求好過，因為可能嗰個消費者佢都驚自己第日有事出咗要負一個誒民事責任啊，賠幾多幾十萬啊，幾一百？

77
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:34,740
百萬啊！做老闆啲驚一單就要執笠啦，所以現階段咧喺我從業員，包括啲老闆咧，係好注重嗰個誒誒員工嘅在職培訓啦、安全啦、誒責任啦，即係各方面啦。所以誒同埋而家用嘅藥啦，就不至於話五六十年代用嗰啲咩Collin啊嗰類。

78
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:44,730
誒致癌物質，即係有機磷嗰啲啦，蟲蟲穀子嗰啲咧，都係對個別人士過敏反應強烈少少咧。如果係喺做前做後誒。

79
00:15:45,010 --> 00:16:05,020
做啲適當安全嘅設施，其實對一般環境生態就唔係咁大影響。同埋喺我哋講行都主張係I P M，即係綜合防治，冇必要都唔會用除害劑嘅。如果政府嗰啲誒誒承包商更加添啦，因為佢用多咗自己成本大咗，佢而家唔會隨便用，因為政府嗰

80
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:25,030
嗰啲合約大啲，比較對市民有影響嘅，即係從業員咧做外圍嗰啲。如果一般日常去做，最多係適當時間噴蚊油。如果涉及pesticide，佢唔能夠隨便用嘅。如果用親咧就罰錢嘅，一定要誒當區嘅誒負責人批准佢啊，用咩藥咩成喺。

81
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:45,040
咩地方用做好詳細嘅報告，先可以畀佢用嘅。其實已經係唔係話冇網管一個petit曬你任何從業員都要根據註冊表註冊，你先用得嘅。如果如果你用啲非註冊藥，都罰錢兼坐監未定嘅，所以一般誒做生意嗰啲唔會噉樣博法嘅。

82
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,750
多謝主席。

83
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:53,300
誒，跟住我想請南華南草坪經理協會葉柏忠先生。

84
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:13,630
誒，早晨，主席各位議員同埋誒官方代表噉，或者簡介我哋個會咧，就係代表誒一班誒有心從事誒專業誒草坪，包括一啲運動球場啊、誒綠化嘅誒草坪經理噉。

85
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,310
噉就我哋定期會有聚會咧，就係。

86
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,440
提升我哋業界嗰個誒。

87
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:40,790
工作嗰個體質同埋嗰個表現噉，透過一係列嘅講座啦。咁通常我哋有海外嘅學者啊、專家同我哋分享喺草坪管理嗰個嘅專業嘅知識。咁誒除害劑係我哋好關注一個嘅議題啦。噉我哋嘅誒今日出席咧。

88
00:17:40,790 --> 00:18:00,800
係誒支持誒政府喺誒除害劑一三三條嘅各方面嘅修訂噉就誒業界方面咧，我啲銅業咧其實都好關注，我哋唔希望係即係我哋唔係一定要用農藥，不過用農藥嘅時候咧，我哋希望都係選擇一啲對環境殘留係低、毒性低嘅誒。

89
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:20,810
產品咯，噉就我哋有啲嘅同業嘅誒心聲就係，其實喺海外咧好多誒更加誒有好多新嘅產品係更加低毒性誒，對我哋嗰個治病除蟲咧係有幫助嘅藥品，同埋誒環境殘留係更加低。但係外於而家嗰個誒。

90
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:40,820
狀況有時唔係咁容易誒可以進口咯，咁希望即係將來有咩修訂咧，可以喺業界誒，即係政府可以提供一啲嘅協調啊，或者係幫助，噉就誒誒，我嘅意見係到呢度。同埋咧誒，如果將來仲有咩其他嘅修訂咧，我哋誒同業咧係好樂意咧係協助，同埋。

91
00:18:40,820 --> 00:19:00,830
提供意見啦，同埋誒，我哋唔介意咧，係誒提供我哋嘅意見誒，畀誒政府嘅咁解。好誒，阿葉生，你係冇書面意見。如果你有書面意見，係歡迎你交畀我哋嘅嚇。OK，但係你嘅發言我哋聽到。咁跟住就係啊啊，香港清潔商會蔡炳然先生誒，多謝主席誒，各位議員，政府官。

92
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:20,840
就我哋嘅會嘅立場咧，其實支持呢個誒法案嘅通過嘅。咁誒內裏嘅情況咧，其實阿梁生都講得好清楚。其實我哋而家業界入邊咧都好自律嘅，嘅工作人員咧都大部分都受過正統嘅訓練嘅。咁當然啦，選用誒低毒嘅除害劑都係。

93
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,900
我哋嘅首選。

94
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:32,300
噉我哋會咧，其實大部分嘅會員咧，而家都係誒清楚知道個法案通過對我哋嘅益處嘅。噉我都唔誒多講啦。我哋嘅立場都係噉。

95
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,910
好多謝你。噉就誒，跟住落嚟咧就係。

96
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,490
Miss Nuria Gonzalez。

97
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,830
洛倫索。

98
00:19:46,290 --> 00:20:00,780
我今日來這裡，代表許多香港的家長，像我自己一樣，極度關心學校、公園

99
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:15,880
Although we understand Hong Kong is a city at danger from different mosquito-borne diseases and other pests, we still think there should be stricter regulations and control in the use of pesticides around children.

100
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,820
特別係在學校。

101
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:24,180
學校 get sprayed in regular basis， and parents are never informed.

102
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:44,470
在我的20年喺香港，我有遇到過很多涉及農藥的事件，無論喺我住嘅地方，亦都係綠地，都有農藥霧化，無任何指導，一陣農藥就飛入我屋企。

103
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,710
exposing my family to the dangers of pesticides.

104
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:57,180
Numerous studies link early exposure of pesticides in childhood to an array of diseases.

105
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:06,920
從 neurological、developmental，和reproductive disorders，到cancers，like leukemia、brain and breast，just to name some。

106
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,820
新報告，released by the American Academy of Pediatrics。

107
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,460
highlights the dangers of pesticides for children.

108
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,630
For more detailed information, you can go to the website.

109
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,380
謝謝。感謝您的關注，我哋希望我們可以進一步討論呢個問題喺未來嘅會議。

110
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,170
Thank you.

111
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Okay.

112
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:50,650
誒，我哋應該仲有一位叫做起動香港陳忠友先生，佢係未到嘅，噉就誒唔緊要啦。我諗就誒跟住落嚟咧，我想邀請各位誒，首先就如果各位團體就未有書面意見，你哋可以後補畀我哋嘅。噉就誒，我哋都接受到兩份嘅誒書面嘅意見，佢就冇出席嘅，亦都。

113
00:21:50,650 --> 00:22:02,530
交畀大家㗎啦，咁大家可以睇睇噉樣樣。噉就誒，我首先就想邀請我哋嘅議員，他有冇就誒團體嘅發言，想有啲詢問嘅噉樣樣嚇嚇陳偉業。

114
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,500
啊！多謝主席。

115
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:24,790
啊！我個問題問啊，Mr. Paul Melson嘅就my question is for就Mr. Paul Melson is regarding to the control of pesticide in Hong Kong。啊，thank you for the providing such a the well informed information to us。I think the committee the you know is well educated。

116
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:32,290
of the problem of the improper use of pesticide in Hong Kong, you know, with those information that you provided here.

117
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:52,580
But you understand that the bill committee, the main responsibility is to scrutinise the introduction of the two conventions that we should implement in Hong Kong. And some of those chemicals that you mentioned in your presentation are not included in the list.

118
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,610
of these two conventions.

119
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:09,870
I would like to know that what will be your suggestions to this committee as regarding to the improvement of the control on the usage of pesticides on two ground. First is on the

120
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:28,870
You know, on the control of the type of you know of chemicals, should we include some of those chemicals that you have mentioned on the list? And secondly, is the administrative control improvement?

121
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:49,160
Naturality change is one thing, but administrative or management control is another. You know, even though if we include those chemical on the list, but if there is no proper management in Hong Kong, no proper monitoring mechanism in Hong Kong, those chemical will

122
00:23:49,160 --> 00:24:09,170
Still be widely used, and public safety, especially children and elderly, will be affected. I would like to hear your views. Yeah, thank you, Albert, Mr. Right on Wall Albert. Can I just say that? Yeah, the chemicals I mentioned, diazinon.

123
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:24,090
If you look at the government mosquito booklet, I've got a picture in there actually. I've got a couple of pages on, but it illustrates that it's one of the organophosphates. Other organophosphates are malathion, temephos and chlorpyrifos.

124
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:38,720
這些是神經毒素，佢哋都連接緊嚴重疾病喺兒童。我知幾多個佢哋都用喺學校，佢哋可以用喺實質嘅課室。冇限制佢哋用喺課室。

125
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:59,010
Diazinon, for instance, was banned, as I said in my thing, it was banned in March in the whole of Europe, and they wouldn't ban it for fun. They ban it because it's a serious pesticide. If you go to Google, and you Google diazinon against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, many many pages come up linking that pesticide to non-Hodgkin's.

126
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:19,330
政府是其實技術上，我抱歉説 inept。我聯繫過政府多次，FEHD、AFCD、EPD、領事服務。幾年來，我兒子的學校被噴過，幼稚園有圖片，長版本有噴過，有Paraquat。

127
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,990
是除草劑，那被噴灑在幼稚園外面。我跟EPD講過。

128
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:44,280
They said it's on the desk. They did nothing about it. Virtually, they just had a word with people. That paracquat, gramicidin should be banned. As far as I'm concerned, dioxin, all the organophosphates. There should be an immediate suspension of those chemicals in schools. The kids are getting this on them. I've got chemical sensitivity now. I go around some of the schools and I can feel the

129
00:25:44,280 --> 00:26:04,290
chemicals coming on me. If I can feel the chemicals coming on me because of chemical sensitivity, because I was affected by a dioxin in one school, I worked in one school with the plants. I had I touched up against the plants in the morning. I I asked the the the gardeners what happened, and and they said I said have you been spraying chemicals? They said yes. I went to the back of the shed. They showed me the

130
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:17,370
bottle of diazepam, I had to go to hospital because I had numbing all up my arms, my leg and my thing, and that was in a school. You imagine the kids are picking this up, not fully realising what's happening. So it is serious. As far as

131
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,300
The technical knowledge of the government goes.

132
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:40,590
Also, just sorry, the Stockholm and the Rotterdam conventions don't go far enough. I've looked at the chemicals, and really, it's great what they're doing. But there's a whole lot of chemicals there, even the pyrethroids, which is another set of chemicals which people think are safe. And you'll be told by some of the pesticide companies that the pyrethroid set of chemicals are safe.

133
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,120
但 in fact， they are derivative of a plant which is the cusamton pyrethrum。

134
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:54,420
They have links to endocrine disruptions and endocrine disruptors, so they are not safe. They have linked to diseases, and still the research is going on.

135
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:01,510
也，政府，我係去咗六樓嘅中沙灣，農藥辦公室。

136
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,490
And the technical knowledge, actually, when I even rang up the FEHD, I'm afraid the technical knowledge is so poor in Hong Kong. It's unbelievable.

137
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,780
他們沒有idea of the chemicals。他們需要技術上跟上國際標準和知識。

138
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,020
Anyway, thank you.

139
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:37,320
I hope that answers the question. And also, I just as I say, there is actually no horticultural college in Hong Kong. If you go to the UK or other countries, they do get training. I had training in the use of pesticides. And while these gentlemen say they get training, the training it's not licensed. So in America and the UK, they have licences. Okay, they have, as far as I'm aware, they have.

140
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:49,230
And they have to know their maths. If somebody goes and sprays in a classroom, they can. I've been told even by directors of some of the companies, they can make mistakes by 10 times. So the concentration can be 10 times in a classroom.

141
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:55,040
And there are new there's microencapsulated chemicals, which are little balls of pesticide.

142
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,710
which have been sprayed in the classrooms.

143
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:18,000
這些，有個半衰期30天，佢，然後其他會破壞，過一段又60天或者更長，所以可以喺課室90天，所以兒童，我講緊小學兒童，會接觸這些，近一年，如果噴三次，一年，係很恐怖，我怕。

144
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,850
在學校， for these chemicals.

145
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:40,650
我想啊，啊梁港源先生都可以畀少少意見嘅，即係作為呢個嘅啊蟲害控制從業員協會嘅代表啊。噉就即係兩個問題嘅啫，即係一個就有關啲從業員誒從事呢個工作誒有關啲化學品或者係啲殺蟲劑，即係對從業。

146
00:28:40,650 --> 00:29:00,660
業員嘅身體嘅影響過去嘅情況，或者佢哋被感染或者係被呢個傷害嘅情況，有冇咩即係資料咧？啊，即係第二個問題就係啊頭先啊Mr.Motion所講嗰個從業員嘅受訓同埋對嘅化學品嘅瞭解同埋使用方面嘅情況，可唔可以提供啲資料畀呢個委？

147
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:20,670
誒，其實呢方面嘅資料咧，你講話要我知，因為我做呢行誒做從事服務啦，或者賣藥啦，我都誒做咗好多年，同埋誒我會都創咗好多年。噉我不嬲以來十幾年，我都有蒐集呢資料。咁以我所知嚇，即係話喺除害劑，我哋啲。

148
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:40,680
誒，前線人員好喺使用過程，使用過程誒，即係話好多年前，我哋又冇數據啦。一近呢幾年咧，因為大部分都係採用偏向採用所謂比較低毒啲啊，對人誒，同埋而家比較用嗰啲所謂水溶性嘅藥多啲，所以基本上若發生。

149
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,010
誒工業意外或者係誒誒。

150
00:29:43,870 --> 00:30:03,880
比較大件事咧，要我所舉就冇嘅，即係唯一有部分人士好似誒個皮膚可能有部分過敏反應，一可能本身對於花粉啊或者嗰類嘅方面嗱敏感，可能會皮膚會痕。不過如果係我哋嗰行，如果核心份子好多受我培訓，好識得之前點樣教嗰個。

151
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:23,890
消費者去預防之後，通知佢幾點鐘翻嚟，declare先知所謂通話器啊，誒，知有咩地方唔適宜噴啊噉樣嘅。即係其實佢哋同埋我哋會都出咗好多雞啦，同埋儘量開嗰啲培訓班教佢哋依方面嘅常識嘅。誒，即係喺我哋嚟講咧，都會陸續。

152
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:29,720
做呢啲培訓，同埋都會另一個目標就教嗰啲消費者，動翻轉嚟點樣監管我哋啲從業員。

153
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:50,230
一消費者監管係最實際嘅一去受害，因為啲要求嗰啲搞嗰啲。反而我哋嗰啲誒手冊啦，即係嗰指引，有時我哋都send去畀嗰啲大企業啦，即係讀翻轉嚟，由啲大企業知道我哋嘅雞咧係講乜。如果佢上嚟提供服務嘅，要某一間公司某某一個從業員讀翻轉嚟，由佢嗰採購部或者佢啲manager嗰啲問。

154
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:57,640
翻到轉頭，你用咩藥啊？點樣教佢？點樣監管翻我哋嗰行嘅？而家中長今，我哋都係做緊呢啲噉嘅功夫。

155
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,090
如果你話工傷，關於從害質引起嘅工傷，或者令到，

156
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:21,070
誒消費者出事嘅個個案少啲又少啊，反而你日常啲人使用其他嘅化物質，好似漂水啊咩，或者日常嗰啲化物質，反而個危險性啊風險大啊，喺市民周邊咧，反而喺我個人認為一種危險過我哋除害劑嘅，如果受訓嘅人員可以用啊。

157
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,100
阿阿梁生，我都想跟住呢個問題，你哋有冇啲統計數字咧？譬如話你哋。

158
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:47,530
嗰個行業嘅員工咧，啲cancer rate啊，呢啲有冇你哋有冇做過研究嘅？即係會唔會多咗比其他人多嘅？啲職業病有冇啲比較統計過？你哋即係我唔知有冇有冇系統性做過呢啲？誒就難啲，因為我哋港行有個唔好處咧。啊，而家個市場分兩大市場，大部分都係政府。如果誒。

159
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:56,380
誒，大約係核心份子四千人到啦。如果統計咧，政府去咗一大部分嘅政府，即係政府意思係外判商嗰啲工人。

160
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:04,250
如果外判身嗰啲工人咧，我諗間食或誒誒，唔係姚護長可能會誒講嘅，我估計。

161
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:11,980
噉樣喺我哋從業員、私人嗰啲老闆都係一般都中小型運作，咁咧佢有啲就。

162
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,880
就比較誒，即係可能有部分，因為收入唔係多，流動性大。

163
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:28,040
誒，如果唔係樓升、樓升、樓棟升唔大，即係嗰啲核心分子間公司一定有啲核心分子，基本上個個都受過培訓嘅，即係以我知道，誒誒。

164
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:47,000
受過工傷或者後遺症，好少啊！唯有個別去初初入行，如果佢真係對於化學物質敏感啊，佢都做唔長嘅，佢都唔會做嘅。依啲誒誒唔排除有依啲噉嘅case出現。如果話做得耐，用我知，我識好多啲所謂前輩啊，或者都個個都好長命喎。

165
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:54,400
啊，應該都唔會話特別話，因為有數據，誒，或者品質又係低。

166
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:15,050
誒出現有問題，同埋我哋都儘量都即係等我哋嘅會都叫啲人儘量去多啲check，即係連接多啲check畀個地，即係儘量都關心佢哋嘅健康。會唔會因為仲係講可能影響到？暫時好冇明顯證據。誒誒，即係因為而家我哋現時所用嘅除氣劑影響到我哋嗰啲前線嗰啲操作人員嘅健康。

167
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:35,060
或者係市民健康唔同話五六十年代用嗰啲T T嗰類啊，或者有機磷。而家有機磷大英時浪嗰啲喺我哋講行已經一般都唔會用嘅，一般都唔會用嘅喺我哋講屬於low啲嘅藥都唔係一個賣點嚟㗎。同埋你而家寫份報價單寫落去，一大部分都唔會畀你做嘅。啱啲老闆唔會咁笨嘅寫落去。

168
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:55,070
O.K.好，黃碧雲主席，我係想補充阿阿梁生個點嘅啫，就即係因為嗰啲除害，即係啲化學品咧，就嗰個對身體嘅影響，特別對呼吸道等嘅影響咧，即係唔啊，好少係即時嘅啊。如果講佢哋所謂涉及喺室內嚇，如果需要話喺我哋叫做空間噴霧，比如話噴嘅接觸面大，第一咧，佢哋一定。

169
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:06,990
要用啲低毒低殘留嗰啲藥物。第二，佢哋一般一都唔會帶塊咩睇睇帶塊一個帶mask有活性炭嗰啲mask，同埋要清場嘅。清完場之後。

170
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:27,470
就係要規定誒，即係變兩三小時誒，開對流空氣誒，degas噉樣嘅。即係你講緊係嗰啲具體嘅行動，我係想問就係從業員方面咧，因為好多時呢啲嘅誒工業上引起嘅身體嘅影響咧，好多時係十幾二十年之後至發覺嘅。就算你譬如以前講呢個嘅廢塵埃沉積。

171
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:47,480
病都係經過好多年嘅爭取，咧逐步加入去嗰個嘅即係誒嗰個嘅工傷或者係嗰個嘅啊職業病嗰個嘅問題啦。噉就即係我想了解多些少喺啲行業方面咧，有冇一啲較為長進啲或者係系統啲嘅研究咧？就係啲員工特別長期喺呢個行。

172
00:34:47,480 --> 00:35:07,490
行業工作嘅員工嗰個呼吸系統嗰個嘅病，同一般市民嘅比較，即係你哋自己有冇留意過呢個問題？因為係涉及嘅資源同埋人力嘅問題，就我哋冇做呢啲統計，即係喺即係大家我哋識嘅會員啊。你話誒十幾廿年前做我哋嗰行真係好高風險嘅行業。

173
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,250
現時今日喺我嚟講，唔屬於高風險嘅行業。

174
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,430
我唔問。

175
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,790
誒，多謝主席。

176
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:37,080
嗯，今日似乎聽咁多個團體講，都好似係贊成政府呢一個修例。不過咧，就有啲咧就係質疑咧，係誒政府係唔應該做多啲，就包括咧要禁止嘅嗰啲誒殺蟲劑誒有毒嘅嗰啲誒物品。

177
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:54,140
就係咪有一啲咧，就係冇列入嗰個名單嗰度？噉啊，包括頭先啊Paul Nelson提到嘅啊戴阿仙奴啦，咁所以個問題係咪嗰個啊禁止嘅殺蟲劑嘅名單唔夠齊全咧？咁？

178
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:10,890
咁第誒另一個問題咧，就係關於誒有團體咧就提到咧，而家行業嘅自律咧，即係已經夠啦，所以就政府唔需要喺今次修例裏邊咧處理埋行業從業員嘅誒守則。

179
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:29,880
噉就，但係我亦都見到有一啲嘅團體啊，雖然冇嚟講啦，但係交嚟嘅文件咧，啊就話咧係政府應該正視立法規管經營者同埋從業員必須有專業牌照先可以啊從事除害劑嘅服務。

180
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,950
咁誒，當初誒，剛才誒。

181
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:41,320
Paul Melsen咧亦都提到咧，就係佢覺得而家呢一個嘅手真係太寬鬆，其實就冇乜用。

182
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:52,030
咁所以，我喺呢度咧就想誒問一問誒唔同嘅團體或者個別嘅人士，對於其實係咪要將呢個名單擴闊？

183
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:03,720
抑或係同時係需要同步係做埋嗰個行業守則嘅規管，係甚至發牌嘅制度，我想聽下大家嘅意見。

184
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:06,890
response。

185
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,450
蔡生係咪？

186
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:30,960
嗱就誒正話，梁生其實都講得好清楚㗎啦。其實我哋而家學內嗰個自律性都好高嘅，而且啲老闆咧亦都都意識到，如果誒做嘢危險，其實佢又未必話幫前線嘅員工，佢只不過咧就驚要賠得多，呢樣嘢係好主要嘅。

187
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:51,410
咁第二第二第二部分咧就誒，我哋而家行內嘅人士咧，其實滅蟲嗰個嗰個前線，我都係做前線卅年嘅，我都有。噉我亦都知道咧嗰個危險性喺邊度㗎啦。噉我哋其實已經可以通過驗身，其實我哋有部分嘅前線員工都好自律嘅，佢自己都去驗下身，即係驚會有事。咁點會？

188
00:37:51,410 --> 00:38:11,420
知道咧，如果嗰個肝嘅酵素高咧，佢就知道佢有問題嘅。噉佢都佢都會退出呢個行業㗎啦。而家因為佢都怕死㗎，係咪？咁其實我哋入邊都有個自即係自然個調節嘅。不過你話發牌呢樣嘢咧，就融合我哋都可能會誒斟酌下，睇下誒可唔可以規範少少。咁其實咧，而家我哋入

189
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:31,430
邊咧嗰個工作嗰個嗰個情況咧，都係採用綜合防治管理嘅，即係我哋都用藥，儘量少用藥嚟做嘅，即係用曬其他物理防治嗰啲幫幫咗先。最後誒用除害劑都係最後嘅手段，而且我哋而家用嘅藥咧都採用安全低毒，即係容易分解嘅藥㗎啦，已經即係唔係話用咩？

190
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,520
有機磷劑嗰啲藥其實都唔係用依啲㗎啦，咁其實行內都都有依個噉嘅傾向嘅。

191
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,260
O.K.

192
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,290
any any。

193
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,250
啊，依家。

194
00:38:43,530 --> 00:39:03,540
葉生係喺誒第一方面，關於誒license啦發牌制度誒，我哋同業同埋我哋同行係持開放態度，會同政府方面合作。不過有個聲音就係誒希望即係誒有咩嘅修訂規管咧，係盡可能嗰個誒係sensible啦，即係合理。

195
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:23,550
啦，同埋都希望咧誒引進任何嘅規管嘅時候咧，盡可能多啲有本地嘅研究。因為好多時咧海外誒引用嘅案例啊、數據，有時未必係conclusive，或者係誒大部分可能海外數據未必係香港適用嘅環境。簡單嚟講，有啲弱。

196
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:43,560
喺外國誒，即係誒適用喺香港未必適用，或者誒有啲嘅病害蟲害喺外國嗰個嘅壓力唔係咁大，但係香港因為我哋嗰個氣候問題咧，就完全係有啲唔同嘅數據噉，需要參詳要考慮啦。咁另外一方面咧，就誒即係我哋好多嘅同業都。

197
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:52,650
好多喺誒海外有工作經驗，亦都慣咗海外嗰啲嘅規管，咁所以我哋係持開放態度啦。不過有樣嘢要提一提咧，就係誒我哋誒。

198
00:39:53,410 --> 00:40:13,420
好多裏邊前線嘅工作人員咧，好多時可能佢嘅誒年資有十幾二十年。好多時呢一批前線嘅員工去入行嘅時候，佢嘅工佢嘅學歷唔係咁高嘅。咁如果喺個拉神城嗰個誒規例太嚴嘅時候咧，變咗我哋可能會即係我哋請人唔係問題，但係變咗有班人可能會冇咗工做。呢係我哋嘅即係喺。

199
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:20,780
即係個社會方面一啲嘅要考慮嘅嘅因素咯，咁希望即係能夠整全去考慮呢個license個角度。

200
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,830
Paul， you want to say something？

201
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:38,900
哦，yes，yes，I do this. Thank you. Yeah, the the people who go and spray the pesticides will have protective clothing on. When they leave, spray the pesticides in the schools, they leave the pesticides there. These pesticides sometimes have active, they they could be there for two or three days afterwards.

202
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:50,820
They can have long half lives of 30 days, so they can be in the in the classroom. The kids can play amongst the plants, pick it up for a long term. And if it's on a regular spraying basis, the kids are bio accumulating these these chemicals.

203
00:40:51,100 --> 00:41:02,090
Additionally, these chemicals also some chemicals will break down, and the the toxic, the the actual which I've indicated, I think the the the toxic chemicals from these.

204
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:22,380
far more toxic, 10 to 100 times more toxic than the actual chemical itself. So the kids are left with this in in the schools. And as I say, the new microencapsulated ones, they may spray these in the in the they can spray demand CS in the classrooms. This is left in the classroom. They can drip the the spray. We don't know.

205
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:32,200
因為沒人見過他們做什麼，他們從來沒有被規管。政府沒有。我打電話給政府，他們説：，直到有人死，我們會做點什麼。那很可惡。所以只有指引。

206
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:52,490
They say they're not obligated to ask the companies what they do. They've told me that they can, as I say, if some child dies, then we have to wait for something like happening in Stanley before, with the girl unfortunately died because the tree fell on her. We have to wait for something like that to happen before the regulation to change. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see some child get poisoned. But there's a long-term effects of poisons.

207
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,210
This is what we need to worry about, and those microencapsulated.

208
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:16,500
balls， as they say， are there up to 90 days. The kids can breathe them in. They can crush them on their arms. But basically， they're there to kill the cockroaches. But it's run along and they break on the cockroaches. These should never be used in classrooms. Canada looked at this before and they they said no， we're not going to use it. Okay， for instance， okay， that particular chemical. As far as the guidelines and risk assessment，

209
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,730
with the FEHD, they are supposed to be a register of chemicals over two years within the schools.

210
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:32,260
A comprehensive record, it says, but in my, my, I've asked in the schools, I've asked the vice principals, I've asked administrators, there is never a records kept.

211
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:38,010
所以這自我規管是完全 rubbish。我 sorry to say that。 it's it's appalling。

212
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:58,300
Also, there's no in the schools. There's no cordoning off put on. There can be pregnant women who sit on the seats after dioxin has been put there. They've got fetuses because many pregnant women go in there that can pick up these chemicals and that can affect them for later development, all sorts of development issues. So there are so many.

213
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:09,640
Gaps in this, I just find it frightening. I fear for my child at school. We don't know it's a secret of what's being sprayed. We never see them going to spray. Nobody sometimes will admit to being sprayed at all.

214
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:29,930
And there's not just the organophosphates have been used in schools because I've seen a list I've shown, and I know diazinon was used, chlorpyrifos was used, temephos was used. And if you look at the government mosquito booklet, it lists the chemicals that be used, which also includes malathion. Although diazinon is not used for mosquitoes, the industry has used it.

215
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:49,960
Okay, and there are different forms of there are different companies. So you've got some companies like Rent a Kill that might be in the Footsie 100, okay, and they're looking for business. And you might get some companies that are very small, and they're going for the lowest tender. So you're either looking for maybe I'm not going to say which one, but one may go for a high kill and use high.

216
00:43:49,960 --> 00:44:00,870
Concentration to kill the cockroaches or the mosquitoes to get more business, okay. So that's not regulated. They can use any concentration they want of chemical, and also the

217
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,270
嗯。

218
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:22,560
The chemical can be sprayed anywhere, okay. Within and they can use cocktails of chemicals. So, in my my sun school, they used demand CS. They use Fendona in the in the in the school in the in the classrooms. And on the outside, you've got mosquito spraying going on. And then you've got the government coming in around the school, the FEHD spraying.

219
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,150
也。

220
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:43,440
other chemicals and I've since spoken to them over the last couple of years and they've stopped they've using safer larvicides which they could use so sometimes they're not always looking at the safest means and then there's also the thing of a rolling programme spray in the schools so they're not looking at specific saying looking at this classroom's got cockroaches in we look at that we try and get rid of the egg cases we'll

221
00:44:43,440 --> 00:45:03,450
sweep up everything and clean it, okay. Which they could do. They've got a rolling thing for business, and they're doing the whole school, okay. So it's really about business sometimes, rather than health and safety. Health and safety comes a long way down, and same with mosquitoes. If you go into the schools, they've got gradients in drains, and also I've seen even recently built ones which are level. So there's no

222
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:14,160
No fall for the water, so there's water accumulation there. So this building regulation needs to be looked at as well, so it gets rid of these kind of mosquito habitats. Also broken drains.

223
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:34,450
Can be fixed. There's also a sump in in the drains which holds water, which that needs to be looked at, and also leaf accumulation. To to get rid of this kind of thing, they can use. It's nice to hear the industry talking about safer means as well. Can I just say as well, it's very positive. There are also CO two heat which can be used a lot more. There's biorepellents that are coming through.

224
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:54,460
Through effective microorganisms, they're very good. Using things like lemongrass and chilli chilli chilli chilli bar repellents. There's also and if once you start getting all the natural stuff in, you get the biodiversity coming back. So there's a bat in Hong Kong called the Japanese pipistrel, and it's very common. It eats up to three thousand insects a night. So if we get rid of all these

225
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:14,470
用的是 pesticides， and we monitor and we keep it at safe level. We can get things like dragonfly. Well, some schools have stopped because I've spoken to them. Have got wildlife coming back. They've got dragonflies coming back and they're eating the mosquitoes. Okay. I think Paul. Thanks. Thank you. 啊，啊，邊個你有誒想follow係嘛？我想跟進就係。

226
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:20,070
其實我都聽誒聽落去咧，其實誒呢個行業嘅誒。

227
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:40,360
朋友咧，其實都唔係反對，係誒提升呢一個行業從業員喺誒即係殺蟲方面嗰個嘅專業守則，或者係誒研究一個發牌制度嘅。不過咧，就係誒究竟乜嘢係一個叫合理？

228
00:46:40,360 --> 00:47:00,370
嘅一個誒規管，咁但係咧今個條例咧就對於呢一方面似乎係誒冇乜特別嘅著墨嘅，只係強調咧就係誒同國際嗰個禁禁嗰個誒有毒嘅殺蟲劑嘅誒誒加咗啲新嘅誒藥品咯。

229
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,240
內嘅啫，噉。

230
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:22,720
會唔會咧？就嗱，我哋當初咧，我哋都誒議員當然就會關心你哋從業員自己嘅安全先啦。嚇，即係會唔會你從事呢行自己都驚到成係要去驗身，即係密仲密過普通人咧噉。咁第二個就係剛才你哋都提到咧，就係話擔心一啲咧早入行嘅嗰。

231
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:41,120
啲比較低知識水平嘅嗰啲殺蟲工人，如果你而家誒規管執到嚴嘅時候咧，佢哋失業咁嗱。咁當然咧，我哋即係會關心工人嘅權益。咁但係誒，我哋都有一個更大嘅公眾利益，就係關於嗰個安全。

232
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,250
咁所以咧就誒。

233
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:54,290
我都想聽下大家嘅睇法，就係話你哋會覺得而家呢個階段，我哋先通過咗呢一個誒，即係禁止嘅邊一啲嘅誒毒物啊？

234
00:47:54,570 --> 00:48:14,580
嘅呢一個條例，然後再商討一個點樣先叫做一個合理嘅規管，抑或大家覺得咧，而家咧唔好過呢條條例住，傾埋嗰一筆先至過。誒有一個整全啲，對於誒關於誒有毒嘅誒殺蟲劑嘅一啲。

235
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:21,290
規管噉，我想睇呢個問題上面聽下大家意見。

236
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:41,730
講先，阿黃議員啊，因為最新嗰兩條誒條例咧，其實涵蓋一啲係頑毒誒環境傳流比較長，兼且有人用緊嘅農藥，噉我建議咧，即係如果可以話，盡快修定，唔好再拖，因為如果再拖咧，就變咗啲人仲可以繼續用。

237
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,480
呢個我個個人睇法。

238
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Any further response?

239
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,260
啊，在啊。

240
00:48:48,640 --> 00:49:08,650
梁生，誒我就誒支持誒，仲快通過咗呢個方案先，因為我哋業界已經係大家有聯會開始傾誒，用咩形式全面，定係全面去去誒監管，用咩形式去監管誒，同政府會陸續去傾誒。因為而家現階段，你而家話誒。

241
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:28,660
誒去涉及，因為你涉及人同埋涉及七十二行，好多人好多人，邊你諮詢好多人，翻個消費者你諮詢啊嘛。所以喺時間上咧，同埋咩好嘅方法，啲個個公司嘅背景唔同，佢要求又唔同啊，係嘛？譬如你水平高嗰啲啊，希望讀三百小時、四百小時中學畢業或者大學畢業係嘛？如果前線嗰班佢需

242
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:48,670
要用前線去做誒噴殺蟲嗰班誒老闆，佢個佢個要求又唔同啊嘛。誒十小時又得個，因為十小時你走去管嗰時做開裝修㗎，任何人都攞個牌啦，係嘛？有咩蝕底？可以冇的士揸嗰時走去做殺蟲啊？噉啊，七國咁亂咯，變得喺度點樣去界定咧？同埋你從業員有啲管理。

243
00:49:48,670 --> 00:50:06,490
公司或者有啲誒誒誒做花王嗰啲間中啊，噴下噉樣點樣界定呢班人係正式滅蟲員咧？點樣攞牌啊？其實係個好複雜，因為我哋都研究咗好耐嘅，包括誒四五年前都研究過，即即大家嘅意見太太唔得統一嘅，即變咗。

244
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:19,250
拖下拖下都拖到而家，所以而家我哋都贊成政府先誒過咗呢條案先誒呢呢個草案，因為你唔過咧，反而仲有機會呢啲噉嘅藥物流入香港。

245
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:30,290
過咗之後咧，我哋從業員其實已經開始，其實一路都有傾嘅，不過係攞唔到個重心啊！點樣界個餅出嚟去規管？

246
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:36,460
所以呢度，我而家我個會絕對支持政府，以前過咗先將呢啲。

247
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:43,950
極之危險嘅藥物。請簡短，簡短。O.K. 啊，跟住落嚟仲有兩兩位同事要發問嘅啫，梁家傑，然之後陳偉業。

248
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
多謝主席。

249
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:58,040
主席，誒，我諗大家都知道咧，由零七年開始咧，其實香港已經係誒有規管，包括除害劑在內嘅一啲有毒農藥嘅。

250
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:04,510
今次呢個條例草案咧，最重要嘅就係。

251
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:23,860
即係限制咗佢出口同埋使用，咁所以我哋覺得誒當然要盡快通過啦，因為而家係用緊嘅，好多啲藥係用緊。雖然而家係監管咗輸入、製造、售賣、管有同埋供應啦，但係即係誒即係使用同埋。

252
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:36,240
尤其是同誒大家關心嘅，即係小朋友啊，或者人身、人體嘅安全咧，我諗盡快限制佢使用，都要攞埋呢一個。

253
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:44,360
呢個許可證咧，我諗係刻不容緩嘅。咁但係咧，我就睇政府交嚟嘅文件咧，主席。

254
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,070
政府咧就似乎同我哋交代咧，就話佢哋一直咧。

255
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,010
都係有對呢一個。

256
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,760
防治蟲害人員。

257
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,670
嘅培訓咧。

258
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,590
同埋咧，係誒，對於嗰個。

259
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,920
呢啲從業員咧，佢係有一個工作守則咧。

260
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:18,760
係想佢哋去誒符合嘅，呢個仲係同業界咧協作之下咧係做出嚟嘅守則。

261
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,150
如果從今日啊嚟，

262
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,250
畀寶貴意見畀我哋嘅朋友嘅口中聽見咧。

263
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:33,220
我可唔可以作一個噉樣嘅初步結論咧？當然，我會畀機會政府解釋一下。

264
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,050
就係呢一個所謂嘅誒，同業界協作。

265
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,880
產生出嚟嘅制定出嚟嘅工作守則。

266
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:50,100
以及政府文件裏邊所提及嘅，佢已經係做咗大量工作，大量啊！

267
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:56,410
致力加強防治蟲害人員嘅培訓，其實。

268
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,150
根本就。

269
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,870
唔係事實咧，或者呢個？

270
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,510
工作守則。

271
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:23,800
係誒有執行上嘅欠缺缺失咧。如果喺呢一方面究竟又有乜嘢各位即係朋友係可以建議下係做得好啲，雖然未必我哋可以將呢啲嘢寫入去呢一個條例草案裏邊咧，噉。

272
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:39,690
但係，你哋今日誒嚟到講嘅都係立此全照嘅喺會議有記錄，官員亦都聽到，秘書長坐喺對面啊。所以我想用誒呢啲時間問一問大家，就係頭先我講嘅問題。

273
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,050
多謝主席。

274
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,170
有冇團體或者代表想發言？

275
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,630
response to his questions any point.

276
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:56,520
作為我之前説過，指引是完全無效的。我已經聯絡過。

277
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,290
政府 on numerous occasions, and there's so many breaches. The obviously it's not been done right.

278
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:10,340
我係農業文化主義，和標準。

279
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:20,060
of spraying, and I was trained properly in the UK, and I like living in Hong Kong. I've been here a long time, but it frightens me immensely of what's going on with children.

280
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:40,360
We don't know how good the training is. It's not regulated. It's not actually. The government don't know. The government always run away from from anything. Whenever I contact them, at all. There should be strict regulation. And when people go, when they go and spray in the rooms, you don't know what's going on and what's been done because nobody ever watches them. Nobody's in.

281
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,340
Nobody's ever monitored.

282
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,510
and they have they have.

283
00:54:45,790 --> 00:55:01,740
And in my pictures in the long version which I've sent you, you can see several breaches which I've got pictures on. Even the other day, last Wednesday, I was going outside open restaurants and there was insecticide being dripped into the drains where people be sitting in a few hours' time.

284
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:22,050
I didn't have my camera with me, but these are the kinds of things that going on. I've actually I've called the police before to stop them spraying diazinon when there's children walking by, and the legislature's admitted they this was a few years ago admitted they got it wrong, and there's diazinon spray coming all the distance around, the vapours coming to everybody, and they had to change their their

285
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:42,060
contract their guidelines. So I've rung up all the I've I've rung the government so many times and I keep ringing them up and there's so many breaches. Nobody is taking it seriously. The chemicals are lying there on the floor. The children can pick them up on their hands, put them in their mouths, and it's a long term effects of these chemicals. The endocrine disruptors, the the

286
00:55:42,060 --> 00:56:02,070
癌症，他們可能在未來生命，因為人們像癌症，10、20年時間，我從哪裡得到那？從，其實是生物積累或這些產品的分解。我之前説過，這都需要被看。在他們的訓練，他們可能不認識，有很不錯的網站，有農藥行動網絡美國或農藥行動網絡英國，這。

287
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:13,280
All the actual accumulation of some of these chemicals, and I don't think it's more of a business thing rather than looking at health and safety and the accumulation of these chemicals in children. It frightens me. Thank you.

288
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,870
有冇其他啱？

289
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:24,230
啊，黃啊，麥小姐，係唔該，主席。誒，想回應一下陳議員同埋啊，Mister Nelson，啊，Melson。

290
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:39,350
誒，關於一個誒呢啲除害劑嘅長遠對人體長遠影響嘅一啲嘅資料，誒業界頭先都有提過，就係其實佢哋細公司啦，冇自冇冇一個。

291
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:59,640
數據去，或者冇一個長時間去monitor住啲前線員工用咗啲除害劑，不論佢係已知係毒性比較高，或者係其實唔係太我哋已知唔係太高毒性嗰啲除害劑嘅時候，其實有冇因為我哋而家係建已。

292
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:19,650
要見嘅係即時影響。咁頭先阿陳議員講到長影響，即係例如可能五年啦，甚至乎廿年嘅。噉我覺得，如果公司啲細公司冇呢啲能力去做一個例如database嘅嘢，噉係咪應該交翻畀政府當局去做一個比較漫長一啲嘅數？

293
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:25,410
數據蒐集可以等日後有一個所謂一個觀察嘅研究。

294
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:37,180
嘅數據資料可以去做分析咧，然後即係例如誒，可唔可以每一年啲公司可以主動或者自願噉樣將佢哋嘅前線員工嘅名？

295
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:50,030
誒send上去，同埋會講埋呢啲員工喺呢一年嚟最主要用嘅，例如邊三類嘅除害劑，咁一路accumulate上去呢啲數據，萬一真係。

296
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:59,400
誒誒，醫管局或者或者誒局方啦嚇，誒發覺香港人有一啲癌病，或者係一啲誒。

297
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,300
一啲誒。

298
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:19,760
心理上嘅一啲嘅disorder，咩都好，再去compare翻究竟呢啲前線員工嗰個risk係咪原來真係高啲咧？我覺得呢個應該係政府長遠去負責收集數據，因為我哋頭頭先都提過呢啲啊誒有機嘅誒。

299
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,460
Pops啦，叫做嚇誒。

300
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:42,750
係好難，科學界都知，係好難收集個數據，因為我哋通常講個毒理嘅時候，都係純粹係睇單一嘅chemical，去去有冇一個acute嘅toxicity，即係個短時間嘅危害，而長時間嘅呢啲，就算係低濃度嘅一啲化學物咧。

301
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:50,370
咧係其實係少少做嘅，同埋係事實上係難做嘅，咁所以我我都誒相信誒。

302
00:58:50,700 --> 00:59:08,840
我認為咧誒，政府係有責任係慢慢做呢個數據，即係誒呢個我估唔會涉及一個誒私隱嘅嘢，或者係唔係想監管業界用啲乜嘢，而係純粹係貨市民到最後嗰個健康嗰個保障咯嚇。各位。

303
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,900
好誒啊！

304
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,590
杜杜瑞啊！

305
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,430
miss露露。

306
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:24,200
Yes, I just thank you. I just wanted to say, for the past two years, my colleague Paul Melson and myself, we have been

307
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:45,060
Having meetings with people in charge of of health and safety in the schools where our children go, which includes many other schools, and it has been a very hard battle to fight because it has been a very very unprofessional.

308
00:59:45,060 --> 01:00:05,070
response that we got from people who are you know in charge of the safety of our children, it took us a long time to first of all get an meeting and secondly when we found out that so many chemicals have been using for so many years in these schools, you know we.

309
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:14,290
We were just given like a very cold treatment, and finally, because we keep trying and trying, you know, we managed to.

310
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:34,580
你 know, basically got at least one of the schools out of the spraying system of of the whole organisation, and this is terrible because it's only because Paul Nelson and myself have been fighting for so long that this particular school is out of the spraying system. The rest

311
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:54,590
都係學校，都係被噴過。我哋同數學老師講，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書嘅，佢哋都好擔心。因為佢哋都係教書

312
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:14,600
inside and outside, like Paul Melsen said, mixing different types of chemicals and and building a cocktail of chemicals, which you know nobody knows how interacts with our children, and we just think there should be stricter regulations, especially in the schools, and really parents should be informed of what goes inside.

313
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:34,610
那些教室和那些操場，因為這些孩子非常非常小，他們在學校上六個小時，而且不斷不斷地接觸這些農藥的危險。去年有一篇新聞在《南華早報》上發表，其實有兩篇新聞，一篇來自香港大學，一篇來自中國大學。

314
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:54,620
It came from the oncology department, and they're saying that cancers among children and youngsters in Hong Kong have risen up so much in the past few years. I'm not saying that that's purely related to this, but we have to look at the whole picture. And my daughter, Paulson, this and other, we're representing many children.

315
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:14,770
Many parents, you know, many childrens in these schools, they sit constantly on the floor. You know, these floors they are carpeted and they get sprayed all around. The life of those pesticides in man-made surfaces are very, very long. You know, they can last for months. I mean, and it's it's very difficult for parents, you know, to to know what's going on in the school.

316
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:34,780
And it's just by chance that Paul Melson found out, and we pursued this for two years. We're very happy with the results. We're not giving up, and we carry on. And we really hope that this can be extended to other schools in Hong Kong, which are get sprayed constantly in regular basis. You know, just for the safety of all those children.

317
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:47,760
They have to deal already with a lot of issues in Hong Kong, like pollution. But at least the indoor area where they stay so many hours, you know, we want to make it a cleaner place and safer place for them to to study, you know.

318
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,890
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

319
01:02:52,660 --> 01:03:10,740
兩家幾兩邊？係啊係，我想跟進一下，即係我我諗，我想啊，秘書長可唔可以代表政府做一個回應咧？就係究竟誒，你聽到誒喺你對面嘅朋友講嘅係唔係顯示到你哋做嘅嗰個誒？

320
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:19,100
即係工作啊！關於去加強防治從害人員嘅培訓啦，同埋執行嗰個。

321
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:39,530
制定咗嘅守則係有進步嘅空間咧。咁如果係個進步空間喺邊咧，以及想聽聽你點樣反應咧？對於阿麥嘉慧博士佢講話，即係最好政府咧就收集呢啲數據啦，因為呢啲數據你唔能夠誒期待。

322
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:59,540
政府以外嘅人咧，係去收集嘅，因為要長期累積嘅。我想聽一聽幾個回應，好嘛？啊啊啊啊啊！嘉傑兄，可唔可以我哋先搞掂曬啲團體問曬佢哋，然之後我哋之後先至，我有一係列嘅嘢要同政府誒回應嘅噉樣。誒，我知道主席，我尊重，但係咧問題就係，如果咁咧。

323
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:19,550
啲團體就聽唔到政府回應，而作出即時嘅再回應。噉我唔知道，我交畀你咧嚇。如果你日後你認為可以處理到嘅，就就如你所所。是咩？你想就呢個方發言？係啊，主席就其實我誒自己就團體嘅問題都基本上問曬㗎啦。咁除非有其他議員即係嗰個嘅誒。

324
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:39,560
進一步啦，咁但係我覺得即係政府嘅回應都係重要嘅。咁頭先我舉手都證證咧，希望政府就翻兩個問題咧，一個就梁家傑所講嗰部分咧，其實一個就係即係有關頭先所提出某啲嘅殺蟲劑係冇喺呢個嘅公約嗰個嘅名單裡面嘅，咁政府有啲咩回應？咁第二個問題就係頭。

325
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:59,570
先講咗好多，就係嗰個實際上嗰個管理，講到好多嘅問題，譬如喺幼稚園啊、小學啊、啲教學機構嗰啲嘅，即係附近，即係或者喺校園裡面，誒，即係使用呢啲殺蟲劑對啲學童嘅影響等等嘅問題咧，睇下政府去一並回應，亦都畀啲團體嘅代表咧，可以聽一聽。

326
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:14,050
政府嘅意見，跟住可以亦都有機會畀團體再回應政府嘅，即係誒論論政府嘅論述啦。OK，好。誒，我收到誒梁家傑兩個問題，同埋阿陳美儀一個問題。噉啊，黃碧雲都有舉手，你正想問團體定想問政府？

327
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:34,340
誒，我一個團體一個問題問團體，一個問題問政府。O.K.，噉你問埋個團體個意見之後，你問埋政府，我哋一拼就叫。好好多謝啊！誒，Mister Melson同埋誒Miss Lorenzo，誒，即係提醒我哋要注意學校裏邊，誒特別係對小朋友誒處身嘅。

328
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:51,370
環境即係嗰個誒有毒嘅殺蟲害殺蟲劑嘅管制嘅問題。不過我想問咧，就係話誒，剛才誒Mr誒Melson提到咧，就係喺外國有一啲學校係完全禁止殺蟲殺蟲劑。

329
01:05:51,650 --> 01:06:11,660
嘅使用嘅咁噉，但係咧就Miss Lorenzo提到咧，就係似乎你唔係話要求學校全面禁止用呢啲殺蟲劑，而係話應該係喺個守則上邊係起碼咧，畀家長啦，畀學校老師啦，係好清楚噴咗啲乜嘢。

330
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:31,670
嗰啲嘢有冇毒？幾時噴？係幾耐咧？就誒唔可以咧？有人接觸，即係咪係喺呢一方面做咗咧？其實你覺得咧就唔需要話完全唔準用殺蟲劑喺學校嗰度。我想聽下呢一個問題，大家睇法咁同埋咧一陣就想政府答。

331
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:51,680
咧就係話噉，其實政府有啲乜嘢嘅守則，係咪應該對於一啲誒頭先剛才提到嘅學校嘅環境啊、公園啊，即係特別要關心一啲年紀比較細嘅小朋友，或者孕婦啊，或者係一啲即係身體比較弱嘅人，即係呢一啲嘅控制或者公眾。

332
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,620
教育或者嗰個業界嘅守則，係咪應該要完善？

333
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:11,080
啊，有三個問題問政府嘅，即係三至四個問題啦。家傑同埋阿陳偉業同埋阿碧雲噉樣跟等政府回應。我先請誒阿誒Nuria Lorenzo就先答咗一個問題，然之後就再等政府。OK。

334
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,680
Maria。

335
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:19,140
Okay, we actually we are. Can you speak closer to the mic? Yes.

336
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,520
We would like to ban all the chemicals inside the schools.

337
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:44,870
But we are pro a way of controlling the pest called integrated pest control management, which is used now in many countries, including Canada and the States. Okay, in Hong Kong, we understand it's difficult. Certain times of the year, you get lots of mosquitoes and cockroaches, but

338
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:47,840
米士波爾馬爾森正在與學校合作。

339
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:57,760
Integrated pest control management, and we what we do, what he does is actually he looks at the sources of of

340
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:18,050
problematic areas and try to target those sources without the use of pesticides. Okay, inside the classes and outside the playground. I think the government, like Mr. Paul Melson said, have been using these larvicides in drainages. Okay, so they have stopped all the fogging that they.

341
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:38,060
用來carry out before， that's a big improvement. So this is what what we mean to control to control the use of chemicals by doing the integrated pest control management that is actually very effective if if it's done in regular basis. This is the most important thing and.

342
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,750
maybe I'll pass the microphone to Mr. Pommelson because he's in charge of the school at the moment.

343
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,070
Mr. Melson.

344
01:08:45,350 --> 01:09:05,360
Yeah, I think there needs to be done a lot more research and development for the government through natural controls, which I've indicated in my long paper. There, they need to really look at the alternatives for the industry, for the safety, also for the workers as well. That there, there are a lot of new things coming into the from from all around the world. Okay, so.

345
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:25,370
There are a lot of alternative methods to control pests, and some pests like cockroaches actually aren't dangerous to health so much as they are more annoying. And you shouldn't go around spraying the whole school because of one or two cockroaches. It's ridiculous. I do understand there are fears of disease which we haven't spoken about.

346
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:37,170
Like dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, and the Nile Nile. So there are fears of those, but they're usually in pockets. Over two years ago.

347
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:57,460
One of the school systems, the whole school system was sprayed. I'm talking about many schools, maybe over a dozen schools were sprayed because of the fear of dengue fever. Now, as far as I know, these were imported cases from other countries, and only one or two schools had a few children had one or two children that had it. So why spray all the schools?

348
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:17,470
Why not really looking? Not have a knee-jerk reaction with dangerous chemicals and use organophosphates, which were used at the time. This is very worrying. It's a lack of knowledge and the overuse of pesticides to expose the children, and then looking at the natural controls is far better. So, but the government needs to monitor and regulate it. The government are asleep.

349
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:34,510
When I've actually also, as far as can I just say the health, I went to Prince of Wales, the toxicological department. There are only there are two toxicological department, trained departments in Hong Kong. One's United Christian and one's in Prince of Wales. But I saw the toxicologist there.

350
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:54,800
And they admitted to me they did not have any information on dermal intake of chemicals. So really, also the hospital system needs to address this as well. I went to the accident and emergency as well at Queen Mary, and the chemical apparently I forget it's called cholestrease or something like that breaks down very quickly.

351
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:14,810
and to actually get a record of what's in your skin, it goes through very quickly. But as I mentioned, some of these chemicals have high toxic effects after they're broken down. So, and also the bioaccumulative. So we need to look. The whole hospital system really needs to look at this as well because it is lacking in data and knowledge. Okay. 多謝各位團體。誒，你哋歡迎喺度。誒，噉就

352
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:15,530
係。

353
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:35,820
但係，我相信誒啲原因問曬你哋嘅問題。但係誒，我哋而家邀請政府代表噉啊，對你哋頭先一啲嘅意見可以response。你中意可以留喺度，但係如果你哋有其他事，亦都可以離開噉樣樣嚇。You feel free to go， but you welcome to stay and listen to the response to the government.啊啊！

354
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:55,830
啊！政府代表啊，陳君如先生，好多謝主席。啊，首先咧就好多謝今日出席嘅各位團體。啊，我我亦都好留心聽咗啊，各位團體啊提供嘅意見。誒，亦都好高興知道，即係誒大家大致上都支持即係我哋呢個條例嘅通過，因為亦都有呢個需要喺度嘅。

355
01:11:55,830 --> 01:12:15,840
誒，我相信咧，誒，從個大原則講咧，即係我哋同今日與會者，包括我哋議員在內咧，就誒政府同埋大家都一樣咧，都係好重視個安全同埋正確使用個除害劑嘅，呢個係個大原則嚟嘅，特別對人身環境嗰個影響嘅。誒，我誒主席，我係想咧，希望從兩個大嘅層面去回。

356
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:35,850
應今日啊所提出嘅問題，一個咧就係從現有嘅制度啊，究竟即係又做緊啲乜嘢嘢啊，發揮緊啲咩作用？一個咧就係從即係嗰個從業員方面，即係特別係嗰個啊培訓啊，同埋佢哋喺個應用，譬如喺學校啊，即係呢啲環境方面，即係究竟有冇咩啊地方係可以再改善嘅？

357
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:55,990
咁誒，我諗先從個制度，我要講一講咧，就誒其實咧，即係而家啊喺香港嚟講咧，係誒喺規管嗰個除害劑方面咧誒，其實我哋而家用緊一條叫除害劑條例第一三三章嘅呢個就係我哋今次提交上嚟嗰條條例。咁呢個咧其實可以話咧係從一個源頭去。

358
01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:16,000
去啊，即係啊規管住，究竟有啲咩除害劑係可以喺香港輸入啦、生產啦、售賣啦或者係供應嘅？咁呢個咧就係啊喺我哋現有制度之下咧，就係無論佢呢個除害劑攞嚟作為農業用途啊、家居啊，你首先第一樣嘢咧就係你要喺一三三之下咧啊，漁護署署。

359
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:36,010
長咧就佢會有一個嘅誒註冊記錄嘅register。咁誒所有嘅誒要喺香港打算你誒售賣呢啲除害劑咧，你都要同漁護處處長咧係先先咧係註冊咗先嘅。註冊完之後咧就誒，然後咧佢先至係可以咧按照佢嗰。

360
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:56,020
個啊啊毒性，即係有一啲咧，我哋叫做係註冊嘅除害劑，有一啲係非註冊嘅。誒，漁護處處長考慮係唔係註冊一隻除害劑嘅時候咧？誒，通常佢係考慮個毒性嘅，只會係低至到中度嘅毒性。咁呢個係根據世界衞生組織即係嗰個嘅準則嘅。誒，然後先。

361
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:04,300
先至係會係將佢嚟到去註冊嘅。誒，一般嚟講，如果係即係係高毒性嗰啲咧，就漁護處處長咧係唔會註冊嘅。

362
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:24,590
咁如果係會註冊嗰啲係點咧？誒都唔係話你即時可以就咁輸入嘅，你都要同漁護處處長咧申請一個license一個嘅牌照，你然後先至係可以係輸入即係呢啲材劑嘅。啊，如果係非註冊嘅，所謂unregister嘅話咧，你就要申請一個permit。咁呢個咧就係。

363
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:44,600
係即係誒誒，即係所謂一個嘅許可證咧。咁如果係要攞permit嘅話，喺現有法例之下咧，處長咧係通常會附加啲更啊嚴格嘅條件，特別係會即係可能會要求一啲係經過有啊較為好嘅專業訓練嘅人員咧，先至可以使用即係呢啲噉樣嘅啊啊未經。

364
01:14:44,600 --> 01:15:04,610
註冊嘅除害劑，即係唔係一個註冊錄上面嘅除害劑。咁呢個咧就係即係我哋嗰個啊現有制度。咁頭先啊，我聽到啊啊麥小姐咧係提到關於咧啊嗰個喺食物之中嘅除害劑嘅。噉我相信呢個咧就係誒講到話，如果啲除害劑入咗我哋食物鏈裏邊，入咗啲食物嘅時，

365
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:24,620
後啊，咁究竟即係對人體個影響嗰個問題嚟嘅。咁其實呢個咧，我哋啊喺啊舊年已經係通過咗一個喺食物中嘅誒殘餘除害劑嘅規例㗎啦。咁呢個條例咧就啊已經係規管咗喺食物裏邊，即係有關呢啲除害劑嘅殘餘咧，究竟有幾多係可以容許嘅。咁當

366
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:36,560
當然係考慮咗個風險評估之後，即係同埋國際嘅標準咧，我哋嚟定出嚟嘅。咁呢個喺舊年立法會已經係通過咗，而咧呢個嘅誒規例咧，將會喺二零一四年八月一號生效嘅。

367
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:56,900
咁至於阿麥小姐提到關於話咧啊，即係啊喺嗰個通報啊或者喺個公佈方面，可唔可以更加做得好咧？其實而家咧啊，食物安全中心咧喺啊定期佢每月都會公佈啊喺佢個市面抽查裏邊，其中包括即係食物中嘅殘餘除藥劑方面啊，如果係有出問題，呢啲會久不久。

368
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:16,910
見到咧，每樣我哋都會有呢啲嘅公佈嘅啊。如果有重大嘅話咧，我哋會更加咧有一個啊，無論係即係新聞發佈會啊，視乎個情況嘅嚴重性啦。我哋會啊係啊就住嗰個嘅啊啊啊需要咧去睇，我哋有幾廣泛嘅公佈噉。但係誒呢個喺網上面。

369
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:33,380
或者喺個誒新聞公佈啊誒，都係個透明度好高度嘅。咁誒，如果即係仲有提議，我哋做得更好，我哋當然樂意係接受嗰個嘅提議。咁但係起碼呢個咧就係分開咗啦。即係如果你係講緊食物裏邊咧，係另外一個規例嘅。而家我哋講緊咧係個源頭。

370
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:54,400
咁誒頭先咧誒，或者話誒過往誒議員都有提到咧，就係啊，無論係陳議員啊或者係黃議員都有提到咧，就係啊，會唔會係而家今次提交嘅禁止名單係唔足夠咧？啊，譬如有一啲嘅啊啊農誒除害劑咧係提出過嘅，譬如阿陳議員提。

371
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:14,410
個嘅百草枯啦，或者今日有提過嘅誒，帝仙龍，我哋叫帝仙龍啦噉樣。咁其實呢個咧喺現有嘅制度之下咧，漁護處處長咧其實已經係有權喺個註冊名單上面咧，因為佢係定期會檢討嘅。誒，嗰個檢討基礎咧就會睇即係國際上面即係有關呢啲除害劑。

372
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:34,420
嗰個毒性嘅研究啦，啊，對環境、人體嘅影響啦，啊，呢個好多時咧，即係會係日新月異嘅，所以咧，即係處長都要成日睇住佢本名冊，誒，亦都會做一個動作咧，就係當如果係嗰個啊名冊裏邊有啲除藥劑咧係被供應咗咧，經過科學嘅驗證之後咧，都係對人體環境有影響。

373
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:54,430
嘅時間咧，佢係會將佢從個名冊裏邊咧喺個註冊名單上面去除名嘅嚇。咁呢個動作係會做嘅。咁譬如我舉例啊，上一次咧，即係啊誒，或者啊陳月琪一路都好誒關注關心，即係嗰個除或者即係譬如對百草夫嚟講咧誒，漁護處其實亦都係誒啊。

374
01:17:54,430 --> 01:18:14,440
係啊！喺二零一二年咧，係認真檢討過呢一隻誒百草枯嘅誒嗰個嘅註冊情況。咁咧，第一咧做咗一件事咧，就係舊年九月咧就誒，其實啊係修訂咗嗰個除草劑嘅註冊條件，就規定咗喺個劑型裏邊咧要加入啲催吐劑，即係會令佢嘔嘅，同埋咧嗰個顏色咧係。

375
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:34,450
啊，會深色好多嘅，即係令到咧嗰個誒警示作用咧係喺度嘅，即係你見到咧，你見到種顏色你都會驚驚地嘅，即係知道係有啲問題嘅。咁誒，除咗加入呢個較為嚴格嘅註冊條件之外咧，誒漁護署咧亦都誒根據本地嗰個具體使用模式咧，係研究緊有。

376
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:54,460
冇其他嘅取代啊！呢一隻即係白草夫嘅噉，而家咧個計劃咧就係啊嗰個啊漁護署咧係準備要取替白草夫嘅誒噉，但係因為呢個嘅應用都係誒現時嚟講係多嘅噉，所以咧我哋都需要一個時間，我哋會係日後咧準備從個註冊記錄裏邊咧將佢去。

377
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,250
刪除嘅。

378
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:15,590
誒蒂先龍都係一個同樣嘅情況啦，同樣咧，即係都係啊。經過研究之後咧啊，蒂先龍嚇誒，亦都咧係啊，處長係準會係逐逐步取替，將佢從個註冊名單上面係會取替嘅。咁當然呢個都係需要一個時間。咁呢個我我呢兩個例子咧，我係想要嚟誒展述咧，即係話。

379
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:35,600
喺現有嘅法規一三三之下咧，漁護處處長已經係有法定權力，係嚟到將嗰個啊，即係喺註冊上面，因為呢兩隻而家係喺註冊冊上、註冊名冊上面嘅。阿陳生啊，其實就即係大家都知道，處長有法定權力係咪後知後覺咁解？即係坐咗咁耐，你先至先。

380
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:55,610
即係仲喺個名單裏邊，係咪應該早啲誒？即係收佢哋誒，即係牌咁解啊？主席，我諗呢個互動嘅，因為即係其實我哋除咗誒話聽誒大家嘅誒接到嘅一啲嘅投訴之外，另外我哋亦都要睇國際上面個使用慣例同埋本地個使用嘅。噉我諗係平衡咗咁多方面咧，即係我哋喺一路做緊嘢嘅。咁當然我哋。

381
01:19:55,610 --> 01:20:15,620
歡迎，即係大家即係去提出。如果譬如你知道某一啲係啊，即係有啲嘅你個關注嘅時間，誒漁護處方面咧係好樂意。陳生，你可唔可以解説一下嗰個名單裏邊，你有冇啲科學家一啲叫advisory committee啊？advisory政府定係處長即係決定咧？噉嘅樣。誒，我哋誒漁護處方面係有我哋嘅專家。

382
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,860
嘅咁誒，或者阿士生想唔想補充下？

383
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:39,770
啊！多謝主席，啊！多謝陳秘書長。其實我哋而家市面上咧，啊，所有係準許售賣或者用嘅除害劑咧，我哋都要係確保咧係啊個濃度係低咧，對人體咧係啊冇害咧，啊或者係嗰個毒性咧係好低咧，噉我哋先至。

384
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:59,780
係畀佢啊！使用同埋售賣嘅其實咧，我哋咧就有啊一組同事咧係做一個呢啲除害劑嘅巡查監察咧，包括咧係我哋巡查響個售賣商咧，確保個除害劑個指引咧係符合我哋嘅要求咧，佢哋先至會嚇畀佢售賣嘅。譬如頭先。

385
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:19,790
啊！所講嘅嗰兩隻啊，除害劑咧，好似陳主員講百草枯同埋呢個蒂斯農咧，其實我哋亦都係同業界咧一路都係有商討嘅。打算咧，我哋希望咧，向二零一四年嘅啊年底咧，可唔可以係取消嘅？因為有一樣咧，啊，我哋大家要留意咧，其實響。

386
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:39,800
響香港係一個亞熱帶地方咧，雖然我哋絕對唔鼓勵係誒市民或者啊任何人士係濫用呢啲除害劑，但係咧響誒對一啲蚊蟲啊，特別啲蚊啊、蚊啊，或者對啊傳染疾病或者對人體有滋擾嘅啊害蟲咧，啊我相信咧，有時咧。

387
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,900
係有需要咧，係將佢係啊啊破滅嘅。

388
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:58,020
啊，多謝主席。唔係誒，我問緊個問題嘅，呢啲一組專家誒，當然你哋可以覺得你哋專家好好，咁但係我問題就係你有冇一啲即係政府好興嘅，有啲advice committee揾啲科學家嚟話畀你聽，邊啲應該要早啲要。

389
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:09,760
早啲要誒除，即係喺個名單裏面除除咗出去。你哋有冇呢啲嘅制度？定係你哋靠你哋處長嘅決定？定係你哋用咩機制去檢討噉樣樣？

390
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,580
或者我補充下啦。

391
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,990
誒，因為除害劑咧，嗰啲。

392
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:21,730
係一啲好特別嘅化學藥品，咁咧就誒。

393
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:30,930
誒頭先有啲誒參與者聽我聽，我哋香港，你可唔可以開開麥？個麥應該用另外嗰個。係，咁咧我哋有啲誒。

394
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:49,300
一除海劑咧，嗰啲好頭，啲好特別嘅，即係呢個呢門科學咧，個好好好專業嘅科學。咁咧就誒，香港本地咧都冇誒大學咧係係訓練呢部分嘅。噉我哋漁護處負責呢度嘅嘅同事咧，我哋係誒。

395
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:59,000
用咗今日送佢去外國咧，我自己本人都係咧就喺英國係讀誒除害劑嘅，咁咧就誒咁所以佢哋誒。

396
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:10,630
如果你話考慮佢哋嗰個誒誒藥性啊誒係咪應該保留啊註冊啊誒消除咧？我哋主要係要跟啲國際嗰啲聯合國。

397
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:30,920
佢糧農組織、世衞組織，同埋嗰啲譬如而家六特丹公約，誒或者係誒斯德哥爾摩公約啲國際組織咧，佢哋嘅即係國際嘅標準嘅，就唔係話即係個別咧本地誒有幾個人講出嚟講咧，就就因為從來咧誒除害劑個。

398
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,000
個應用咧，都係好爭議性。

399
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:53,380
譬如頭先誒提到誒，好用嗰只誒用一啲藥喺學校度用好多隻藥，誒誒好危險噉樣。但係其實我想講咧，就係因為嗰個害蟲嘅種類好多，每一種藥咧又是新嘅藥咧，佢會好專門，咁所以咧佢係有唔同情況。

400
01:23:53,380 --> 01:24:13,390
真係需要用幾種藥咧，先至可以對付到佢哋嗰個誒，即係夾埋嘅嘅問題。譬如頭先啊，市處長講佢，如果你講係懵個個個蟻蟲，你就會係有特別嘅嘅情況，特別嘅藥。你係誒誒嗰啲曱甴，噉你活曱甴就會有另外一類藥。

401
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:24,530
蚊噉樣，咁誒頭先佢提到嗰啲誒有啲誒朋友提過就話，佢哋唔贊成用嗰啲誒有機磷啊，甚至乎嗰啲誒。

402
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:44,940
誒菊之類嗰啲paraffine啊嗰啲藥，咁但係呢啲藥咧就其實就正正係世界衞生組織建議嘅，而且佢哋建議嘅唔單止幾隻係一個好長嘅list，好多嘅藥。點解要用咁多藥咧？因為你唔能夠單用話我淨係用一隻藥、兩隻藥去去去去滅蚊。

403
01:24:44,990 --> 01:25:05,000
因為你噉樣用法咧，嗰啲蚊咧會產生抗性嘅，咁所以你啲藥咧你都要係輪替嘅使用嘅，咁所以好誒，即係頭先講就係佢用藥嗰樣嘢就即係好專門，我哋決定嘅嘢咧都係會跟國際嘅組織去做，咁亦都提一提咧就話我哋其實咧誒一直以嚟咧我哋總共其實。

404
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:23,890
取消咗三十六隻誒有害嘅，即係我哋認為唔適合再登記嘅藥咧。我取消三十六隻嘅註冊，其中只係有十九隻喺呢兩個國際公約上面列咗出嚟啫。誒，另外嘅十七隻咧就係誒，我哋處方覺得佢嗰個因為新嘅科學文獻。

405
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:29,600
誒，我哋證明佢係誒對香港係唔濕，所以我哋取消登記。

406
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:43,000
誒，你哋頭先提過，我哋唔係淨係睇佢哋啲急性毒性嘅。我哋註冊嗰陣時，所有嘅嘢，誒，今日出席嘅提過幾次啊？佢話啲嘢係有endocrine disruptor，影響內分泌。

407
01:25:43,280 --> 01:26:03,290
誒，我哋逢係影響內分泌係有定咗科學有定論嘅，我哋係一定取消登記。我哋係唔會將懷疑影響內分泌嘅藥取消登記，因為太多藥係懷疑影響內分泌。差唔多全世界你講得出嘅藥，好大部分你都會有講呢個懷疑。

408
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:19,440
但係我哋講嘅係科學，我哋一定係對人證明係影響內分泌，所以我哋嘅藥逢係影響內分泌，逢係影響誒胎兒，逢係影響胚胎。如果有科學證據嘅，我哋全部都會取消佢登記。

409
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,260
噉就誒。

410
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,860
誒。

411
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,240
噉我簡單嘅原因就咁啦嚇。

412
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:46,060
陳偉業，噉啊，主席就我希望政府書面能夠畀到少少資料啦。噉就因為跟住誒下幾次會議可能就會誒進行嗰個嘅逐項審議咧。噉就誒第一個問題咧，就係頭先講咗有幾種嘢冇喺呢一個嘅兩個嘅公約嘅名單裡面。咁政府頭先亦都講咗。

413
01:26:46,060 --> 01:27:06,070
個別某啲嘅項目咧，譬如百草枯嗰啲，佢遲啲會取替咧。噉就即係誒，我哋呢個委員會誒裡面所提出嘅誒名稱咧，或者嗰個嘅化學品或者殺草劑嘅名稱咧，只係部分啊。咁譬如喺零六年，我喺立法會都提咗個問題咧，即係嗰陣時就提咗呢個嘅三無。

414
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:26,080
中嘅呢個gramenon，即係即係另一種嘅嘅藥。咁即係我想誒稍後政府可以書面地畀到咧，喺呢個嘅兩個工作嘅名單裏面，同埋現時嘅名單裏面，仲有邊幾種加現時喺香港市場仍然使用嘅所謂嘅殺草劑咧，係冇喺呢個管制名。

415
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:46,090
單之內嘅噉，你覺得點咧啊？噉就誒，第二就係誒，即係頭先誒阿Mr. Paul Mau嘅時候都提到咧，某一啲嘅殺蟲劑咧，香港仍然有應用嘅話咧，喺英國已經係禁止使用嘅。噉我都想知道喺香港使用緊嗰啲嘅殺蟲劑或者有關嘅化。

416
01:27:46,090 --> 01:28:06,100
化學品喺英美加澳紐嗰啲地方已經禁止使用嘅，仲有邊啲喺香港繼續可以使用嘅？嗱，咁當然喺其他國家嗰啲嘅禁制其實有兩個層次。我第一次委員會我都有提嘅啦。咁一個就係佢呢個嘅國家用呢個嘅啊國會立法形式嗰個。

417
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:26,110
個嘅控制嘅噉，第二個層次就係市政府透過市政府自己嘅條例禁止使用嘅。我上一次都提到咧，即係譬如加拿大某啲嘅城市咧，喺城市裏面係已經係禁止使用呢一個嘅啊，即係唔唔少嘅。

418
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:46,120
誒呢個嘅有化學品嘅誒殺殺殺草嘅誒，即係化學品啦，啊噉就誒第三個問題咧，就係誒行政上嗱，你嗰個條例嘅操控係好多係售賣即係方面啦，咁但係。

419
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:50,020
係就誒，我理解喺現時香港嘅情況咧。

420
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,890
個別市民去呢啲地方。

421
01:28:54,170 --> 01:29:14,180
買呢啲噉嘅農藥或者買呢個啊啲殺草水咧，係好輕易嘅事嚟嘅。咁而亦都佢可以喺自己即係，因為你冇牌照規管啊嘛，即係任何人都可以買咗之後咧，隨意周圍即係呢一個嘅用咧。我中意喺我路口啊噴一噴又得，噴。

422
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:34,190
原因今日又再噴，即即佢因為未必識使用咧，佢可以胡亂使用，咁導致到即民居民即使用者附近嘅民居或者係學校或者係路邊咧，係受到嚴重嘅影響嘅。呢個問題喺新界係好嚴重嘅。咁政府就翻呢個問題，即透過呢個條。

423
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:54,200
第一，透過呢個條例嘅修訂有冇任何改善咧？可能完全冇嘅，因為呢個行政管理問題啊嘛，係嘛？咁呢個問題咁又點處理咧？係咪我哋唔可以話？因為你落落做咗兩個公約，包括在內就好似解決咗個問題。其實嗰個問題即係如果係依然存在嘅話咧，咁呢個委員會睇下有啲乜嘢透過條例嘅修訂可以改善呢？

424
01:29:54,200 --> 01:30:14,210
呢一個嘅影響市民健康一個好普遍存在嘅問題。OK，我政府聽到，不過咧就誒，阿陳偉綺議員，你可能你都應該留意，都睇咗，即係政府喺今日回覆上次嘅文件，即係CB區會議七六三裏邊，關於即係佢個附錄A裏邊一啲即係本地誒使用嘅除害劑，佢已經有。

425
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:23,150
個好詳細嘅表列咗出嚟嘅，我相信嗰個部分亦都係即係輸入緊用緊嘅財資。當然一間可以大家可以正可以特別可以提提就。

426
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,310
誒。

427
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:44,000
即係有邊啲呢啲呢呢呢呢兩份文件用緊嗰啲咧，就係其他你所講嘅誒英美澳樓價已經禁用啊，或者政府可以high咧畀我聽聽。啱間我嚟頂下先。噉啊啊，我想咁咧，因為時間所限咧，我想幾位議員問曬你政府一齊誒答，好嘛？阿黃碧雲同埋梁家傑。

428
01:30:44,790 --> 01:31:04,800
誒，我我都注意到咧，誒呢個條例係會誒賦予漁護處處長咧有權係誒發牌或者規管嗰啲進口或者香港使用嘅誒有毒嘅材質。不過我想問一問就係話，其實而家業界有幾普遍，就係話會唔會即使我哋香

429
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:10,190
香港把關好嚴，即係規定邊啲先可以賣，邊啲可以用，即係會唔會？

430
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:21,520
有咩措施咧？就係誒防止誒有啲偷運入境嘅，或者係使用非法使用一啲進口嘅。

431
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,000
究竟即係嗰個嗰個情況，而家喺香港係唔係好普遍？

432
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:46,290
因為即使你話管得好嚴喺香港唔準賣啲嘢，但係佢喺大陸買過嚟或者第度攞過嚟用係咪平啲咁？而嗰啲可能亦都係好有毒性，即係嗰個誒，你點樣有冇統計過冇非法使用呢啲嗰個情況係幾嚴重？同埋過咗你呢條條例又處唔處理到呢？

433
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,700
啲非法嘅問題。

434
01:31:47,980 --> 01:32:07,990
第二個問題咧就係關於誒二月二十六號咧呢個委員會開會嘅時候，有一啲跟進事項，就係想問香港同埋加拿大温哥華喺規管除海劑制度嘅比較。我想問誒政府係咪已經做咗啲比較？可唔可以簡單講一講？誒而家。

435
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:10,740
個收例係向邊一個方向發展？

436
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:17,910
誒，其實個幾教嗰度，大家都可以睇翻個文件，應該有喺度啊，C B六七誒。

437
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:25,720
七六三嚇，大家睇睇，噉就啊，家傑兄，誒，多謝主席，主席頭先秘書長咧，可能係誒。

438
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:46,050
聽漏咗我問嗰啲問題啊，即係我就話即係個與業界一層一齊共議出嚟嗰個工作守則啦，同嚇同埋同埋嗰個防治重害人員培訓啦，佢會諗住有啲咩空間可以進改善一下噉，同埋就我問個就係誒。

439
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:53,390
誒阿阿麥嘉慧博士佢提嘅嗰個政府署數據，佢打唔打算研究下咧噉樣？

440
01:32:54,370 --> 01:33:03,180
啊！我唔知道，秘書長係咪想今日答埋呢個？我諗答埋啦，好嘛？係啊，我諗幾個問題，幾議員，我諗你啊，啊，秘書長，你逐個答好嘛？好。

441
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:25,150
誒係啊，冇畀人怨。仲有一個問題就係話誒過咗呢一個條例啦嚇，假設誒能局方啊或者處方能唔能夠啊講清楚畀我哋聽，你計劃嗰個嘅時間表將會點樣再進一步落實，即係規管。

442
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:32,600
即係嗰個發牌制度同埋業界嗰個嘅守則，即係打算需要用幾多時間啊，同埋點樣做？

443
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:53,130
政府有冇計劃落實呢一個發牌制度先？誒，我諗一氣一評答啊嘛嚇。先，我諗先答答梁家傑，因為其實可以跟埋主席，或者或者我其實我頭先講話兩方面啦，一個就係現有嘅制度，一個咧就係喺個即係誒啊從業員個守則啊，同埋佢即係誒嗰個應用啊。

444
01:33:53,130 --> 01:34:13,140
係咪出現流動咁？頭先我講咗係現有制度嘅，容許我補充一句，主席誒，因為頭先啊黃議員都提過話，咁究竟通過咗之後係咪能夠改善到嗰啲即係非法嘅？我相信係你講緊係即係誒跨境，譬如喺深圳買翻嚟一啲嘅非法註冊農藥。咁容許我講咧，就係喺現有。

445
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:33,150
嘅法例之下，一三三咧已經係一個非法行為嚟㗎啦，唔需要我呢個通過手則。呢個就係我話現有制度意思，因為你入口咧，你唔可以入口一啲即係未經註冊嘅噉。誒，我哋過往咧係啊，即係有啲檢控數字，譬如零八年我哋有五五宗嘅檢控數字啦，罰款係一千至六千蚊嘅。

446
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:53,190
零九年咧有八宗係一千至二千嘅啊，一零年冇發現啦。一一年係四宗，八百至二千蚊。一二年係七宗，八百至五千蚊嘅。咁呢個喺現有嘅法例之下已經係即係有權去檢控㗎啦。噉我哋誒漁護處嘅同事咧都會係誒經常定期咧係去啊。

447
01:34:53,190 --> 01:35:13,200
啊，新界啲農地啊，同啲農友咧係有接觸，就係啊，即係誒第一咧，就係去睇下佢哋有冇用呢啲噉樣嘅啊非法嘅誒註冊農藥啦，第誒藏有呢啲噉嘅農藥啦。第二咧就係亦都係提醒佢哋咧係要用即係經註冊嘅農藥嘅。呢個我哋誒常常啊喺漁護處方面咧都係佢定期。

448
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:33,210
工作一部分嚟嘅，好啦，我進入第二部分咧，係關於嗰個啊，即係從業員方面啊，係咪需要發牌啊，同埋咧係即係究竟個啊啊，我哋同佢發展嘅守則係啊係咪有效咧？有冇改善空間呢個問題嘅誒？的而且確咧，喺零七年嘅時間咧，當時政府咧係有考慮。

449
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:53,220
個咧係啊，要做一個咧係從業員嘅發牌守則。咁呢個發牌守則咧就係即係希望透過咧即係要培訓啦，即係佢要啊接受到一定嘅啊訓練嘅鐘數嘅，亦都咧係啊透過咧係一啲規管嗰啲公司，如果佢要請啲從業員嘅時間咧，即係都要有個發牌。

450
01:35:53,220 --> 01:36:13,230
嘅規管噉，但係啊喺嗰個嘅諮詢期裏邊咧，我哋睇到咧，正如頭先業界亦都有反映咧，因為喺業界裏邊咧啊嗰個嘅啊水準咧係參差嘅。咁所以如果我哋係啊同埋咧嗰個培訓課程咧，當時喺當時嚟講咧就比較唔係咁多嘅。咁變咗咧，我哋睇到咧，即係如。

451
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:26,820
如果誒冒然間成一個噉樣嘅啊制度嘅話咧，就可能會對個業界從業員咧係會有個好大影響嘅。誒業界嘅從業員亦都有嗰個嘅反響畀我哋。噉我哋考慮咗之後咧，我哋係。

452
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:47,110
好似我哋上一次份文件係啊提供咗畀大家咧，就喺第十四段都有講到咧，就我哋就係考慮咗咧，如果我哋要達至一個目的，話希望提高喺業界裏邊嗰個安全使用除害劑嘅啊原則嚟講咧，我哋覺得有三方面可以做嘅。第一咧就係我哋咧係誒，希望能夠

453
01:36:47,110 --> 01:37:07,120
設計到一啲合適嘅訓練課程嘅光耀嘅，咁呢方面咧就啊，我哋好高興咧見到即係喺國控咧就開始即係多咗啦，即係譬如喺啊Hong Kong U啊即係嘅啊啊啊Space嗰度咧係有嗰啲嘅啊課程係嚟要提供叫蟲害控制同埋安全使用啊殺蟲藥嘅課。

454
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:27,130
課程嘅，亦都咧喺香港理工大學專業進修學院Speed咧，係有即係雙類同嘅噉樣嘅課程。咁呢個係一個即係設計課程，亦都我哋見到咧業界方面咧係參與咧係高咗嘅嚇，即係喺度提升緊嘅。誒，從零七年十個percent嘅人收到啊參與咧，到到一一年咧，我哋見到有接近八成嘅人員。

455
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:47,280
第二方面咧就係頭先所講嘅，係同防治蟲害公司咧，同埋從業員體育嘅啊用途嘅草地管理人員啊，同埋農民等唔同嘅界別，因為唔同界別有唔同需要嘅，噉我哋係制定咗一啲嘅工作守則嘅。咁誒呢方面咧，我哋係誒見到係有個積極嘅誒進步嘅，就每日。

456
01:37:47,280 --> 01:38:07,290
業界都係好樂意去提供點樣去，因為佢哋誒本身嘅人員都係用緊呢啲嘅材質，佢哋都希望能夠安全嘅，所以即係誒，我哋睇到業界嘅反應都係好積極，係誒，希望能夠嚟到去啊做得更好。咁當然呢個誒頭先啊啊梁月問個問題話誒喺個應用或者今日譬如聽。

457
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:27,300
聽到某些嘅情景裏邊，某些個案裏邊係咪有改善空間咧？噉我我哋永遠都覺得，即係我哋我哋希望做得更加好嘅。誒，當我哋發現有呢啲，因為呢個係一個持續過程，唔係一次過嘅嚇。誒，所以頭先阿麥小姐提供話，即係提議嗰個話，如果譬如係業界誒可以畀一啲嘅誒。

458
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:42,450
資料我哋提供佢哋嘅人員，啊佢哋嘅誒參與嘅誒誒嗰個背景啊學歷嘅質素，我哋係樂意去建立呢啲嘅數據庫嘅。誒咁呢個就要業界方面咧，即係能夠去去同我哋一齊攜手合作嘅。

459
01:38:43,190 --> 01:39:03,200
第三咧，當然就係透過嗰個教育，咁呢個亦都係一個誒持續過程嚟嘅，就啊包括網站啊單張，對於個市民咧，即係去對個安全同正確使用除害劑咧嗰個認識嘅誒嗱。咁誒喺實際嘅運作裏邊咧，即係我哋睇到咧，過往啊，我哋去啊翻查。

460
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:23,210
啲數據咧，我哋未見到有咧，因為錯誤使用除藥劑咧而導致一啲嘅重大事故嘅嚇。呢個就我哋係睇咗嗰個記錄。咁當然我哋亦都聽到今日誒兩位外籍嘅誒朋友咧，即係佢提到關於喺學校個應用嘅咁誒。我可以喺呢度承諾咧，我哋護署方面咧就會係誒，即係特別係。

461
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:43,220
就住所提出嘅個案咧，我哋會係去跟進誒睇下，仲有啲咩地方係可以做得更加好嘅。咁呢個我我哋會去誒有個有個嘅研究喺度嘅。噉我哋都係其實喺呢度講咧，我哋好歡迎，譬如好似陳米業議員咧，就誒喺以往都提供咗好多嘅個案畀我哋。噉我哋好樂意。

462
01:39:43,220 --> 01:40:03,230
見到嘅，因為誒呢個係一個互動過程。誒，陳議員提到咧，即係佢有三個問題嘅。第一咧就關於零六年佢提過嗰只個案咧，其實咧嗰只咧誒就係都係百草枯嚟嘅。不過喺市面上面咧，佢叫黑毛棕啊，嚇，即係個名都比較特別啦。即係都都應該聽都知道唔係好嘢嚇。咁其實。

463
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:23,240
即係呢個咧，就係百草夫最為人熟悉嘅牌子名稱嚟嘅嚇。咁所以我哋係有有照顧到嘅。第二方面咧，關於個加拿大咧，其實我哋上次咧，我哋翻咗去之後，我哋係有研究過嘅。誒，我哋睇到加拿大咧，如果喺個誒national level，所謂國家層面咧，其實佢嘅制度同我哋係好類近嘅，即係都係用一個即係頭先所。

464
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:43,250
講註冊名單，然後跟住license permit，即係一個牌照啊許可證，即係一個噉樣嘅規管，同埋定期要檢討嗰個註冊名單上面嘅啊除害劑究竟係咪安全嘅？誒喺個地區層面咧，即係喺温哥華，我哋都盡我哋嘅努力，我哋去認識清楚。咁誒，我哋都睇到佢係嚴格啲嘅，但係就。

465
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:53,040
唔係話完全即係禁住唔畀用嘅嚇，噉我我哋覺得大體咧，我哋同加拿大喺個國家層面誒嗰個使用方面咧，係都係一致嘅。

466
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,400
誒。

467
01:40:55,150 --> 01:41:15,160
第三咧，我諗啊，阿陳茂業議員都提過咧，關於嗰個啊個別市民即係提出即係嗰啲個案。頭先我都講過，即係我哋我哋係誒願意就住誒今日即係所提出嘅個案，亦都日後如果有誒類同個案咧，我哋都好歡迎議員係提供畀我哋，等我哋可以漁護處同事咧係能夠一齊監進誒跟。

468
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:35,170
進嘅，即係我諗，因為誒始終咧，即係啊喺個使用除害劑咧，正如頭先我哋啲同事都講過咧，就喺現代嘅啊社會裏邊，特別喺香港啊，即係呢個亞熱帶環境裏邊咧，誒係啊有佢嗰個嘅誒一定嘅需要。咁當然亦都係要留意對人類同埋個環境。

469
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:39,790
嘅安全嗰個嘅兼顧，咁呢個我哋係一路都都會遵守住。

470
01:41:40,350 --> 01:42:00,360
O.K.啊，我諗係啊，陳偉業係即係當然誒，比書長即係大部分答咗啦。會唔會有啲係書面可以補充翻咧？即係特別關於嗰個行政管理同埋嗰個監管嗰個嘅，即係點樣去確保？因為過去就好多問題係爆發咗之後拖好耐。頭先啊，Mr. Wilson即係都提到咧，過去幾年同政府。

471
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:20,370
會有好多個部門傾咗好多次，咁但係完全冇措施做嘢嘅。噉我哋希望透過呢個條例嘅修訂之後，即係究竟嗰個實際行政同埋實際嘅監管管理等等方面有啲咩改變啊？明白係嘛？即係呢個我諗你交份資料，好啊，主持我哋把握啲資料，你都可以畀翻我。好好，我哋把握呢個。

472
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:40,380
契機，我相信陳源嘅意思就係把握呢個收利嘅契機咧。我哋再去睇一睇，即係喺而家現有嘅行政制度方面，我哋點樣可以更加改善？包括啊，主席你所提過話，會唔會有啲專家啊？我哋可以參考啊。即係呢個，我哋都樂意去翻去研究嘅。OK，好啦。誒，首先我想多謝，再一次多謝嚟嘅團體同埋。

473
01:42:40,380 --> 01:43:00,390
人士，你哋發表嘅意見就誒呢次會議之後，如果你哋有任何嘅意見，歡迎你哋書面寫入嚟我哋嘅委員會。咁誒，其實你哋委員會，你哋各位人士亦都，如果你想關注我哋嘅工作，你哋都喺立法會嘅網頁可以睇到我哋所有嘅相關嘅文件嘅嚇。你哋係歡迎你哋噉樣。

474
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:20,400
好多謝大家啊！歡迎你哋今日出席啊！多謝大家嚇。咁咧就誒誒，政府今日亦都有一份文件誒，就提交畀大家。我相信大家亦都睇咗，頭先亦都喺答嘅過程裏邊亦都已經涵蓋咗啦。我相信就噉，所以咧就誒，剩低嘅咧就頭先阿陳偉業議員咧就問過一啲問題噉啊。

475
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:40,410
頭先阿阿秘書長亦都答過一啲，噉我諗秘書長我諗綜合去睇睇，誒下次交翻份文件答翻曬頭先所嘅問題啫，噉樣樣。我哋咧就下次會議日期應該喺四月十五號嘅，四月十五號嘅上午十點九，咁睇下大家有冇誒喺呢個階段仲有冇嘢。

476
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,920
特別要求政府要交代嘅。

477
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:53,850
如果冇嘅咧，我哋就或者有會有係；如果冇就頭先綜合嗰啲啦。如果有嘅時候，就大家再書面誒會後再同我哋講。多謝大家，我哋今日嘅會議就到此為止。多謝。
