15
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:48,070
You can get the translation, right? I didn't get the translation, I'm afraid. Yeah, actually, well, I suggest you continue the last document that you have introduced to us, and also briefly answer what we have, what we had question.

16
00:02:48,640 --> 00:03:08,650
Thank you. Administration last time. Yes, in fact, as far as I know, we've responded in writing to the various letters from the Bills Committee Secretariat dated the sixth of February and the thirty-first of January respectively, and that sets out the information requested by the Bills Committee at previous meetings.

17
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:18,090
I I won't repeat the detail of our response because I think it's in our written replies, but perhaps I can just highlight a couple of points. Okay, might be helpful.

18
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:30,890
On the enhancement of the special stamp duty, we'd like to emphasise that special stamp duty has been effective in curbing short-term speculative activities since its implementation in November of 2010.

19
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,970
它已經最有效果在於壓縮確診個案和重複個案在六個月內。

20
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,840
But that said, we have reviewed the special stamp duty.

21
00:03:41,120 --> 00:04:01,130
In view of the continued exuberant state of the property market, we note that a number of short-term resale cases, and particularly those resold between 12 and 24 months, have been on the rise. We think this is because properties bought in the early months immediately after the introduction of special stamp duty reached the end of the first year.

22
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,080
of the highest stamp duty rates. That's 10 and 15%.

23
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,760
given the current tight supply.

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:29,050
situation， we see a need to provide a stronger disincentive for speculators and short-term investors. Accordingly, our proposal is to enhance the special stamp duty by increasing its coverage period from twenty-four to thirty-six months, and of course by increasing the rates for the different holding periods. And the point here, of course, is that it's

25
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,330
Clear that 10, 15% has an effect, but 5% clearly doesn't have a persistent effect.

26
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:48,040
另一個領域是，有數位人士表達了觀點，認為特別印花税可能會導致住宅物業價格進一步上漲。確實，我認為在上一次會議上，數位代表也提到了這個問題。

27
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:58,680
we're of the view that special stamp duty will reduce the impact of short-term speculative activities immediately, and it will in turn reduce the risk of a property bubble.

28
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,490
With most speculators driven out of the market, the number of flats held by speculators should gradually decrease.

29
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:19,360
as to the genuine home buyers, in general, most will not resell residential properties they acquire within a short period of time in the first place. Therefore, the introduction and enhancement of special stamp duty should not have a significant effect.

30
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,690
on the supply of flats held by these end users, since they probably wouldn't have been releasing them anyway.

31
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:38,310
所以總體，我們認為它提供其實一個更穩定的市場，這就是目標。所以因此，我們不見到有顯著的影響在總體的供應物業供應上。

32
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:53,110
Now，turning，to，the，buyers，stamp，duty，the，objective，as，I，think，we've，stated，is，to，accord，priority，to，Hong，Kong，permanent，resident，buyers，over，non-Hong，Kong，permanent，resident，buyers，under，the，current，market，situation.

33
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,300
我們 note that some people have suggested that companies owned by Hong Kong permanent residents should be exempted from the buyer stamp duty.

34
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,570
我諗，我需要再明確一次，即係，呢個係政策意圖，即係所有公司，無論係股東或者董事，係香港P.R.S.

35
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,160
他們應該 subject to buy stamp duty.

36
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:35,450
as we've repeatedly explained, we do not consider it appropriate to exempt company buyers from the buy stamp duty. major concern is that in doing so, we would perhaps lead to the problem that Hong Kong permanent resident shareholders can fairly easily circumvent the buy stamp duty through transferring property entitlements to

37
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,490
非香港PR股東。

38
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,890
and thus seriously undermine the effectiveness of the buyer's stamp duty.

39
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:58,530
Specifically on the suggestion to exempt companies from buy stamp duty when they acquire a residential property for redevelopment purposes, I can again confirm that our policy intent is that buy stamp duty should not hinder redevelopment.

40
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:10,920
所以，under the stamp duty amendment bill 201 to the bill， a refund mechanism is proposed whereby acquisition of residential properties for the construction of immovable property will be exempted from the BSD.

41
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,830
但這係provided，that the immovable property being constructed is completed within six years.

42
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,940
I think we've mentioned this before, and we will allow for extensions in specific circumstances.

43
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,180
在drawing up this proposal， we've made reference to the land bracket compulsory sale for redevelopment ordinance.

44
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,710
That's cap five four five.

45
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:43,170
For buy-a-stamp duty purposes, the general rule is that the six-year period will start when the relevant developer has become the owner of the entire lot of the redevelopment concerned.

46
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:58,560
thus the refund mechanism will take into account all the views expressed by the trade on this issue. For instance, we note that it takes time to acquire properties to be redeveloped. We've therefore proposed in the bill that we

47
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:07,890
Don't start the countdown until after the property as a whole has been acquired. I think that gives sufficient flexibility to the industry.

48
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:15,590
One final point. We've there have been some suggestions that a time limit should be set for buyer's stamp duty.

49
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,700
We don't consider that this would be possible because we simply can't predetermine.

50
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:29,170
when the market will change the the situation and when buyer's stamp duty would be deemed no longer necessary.

51
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:39,440
我們將繼續密切監察房地產市場，並參考綜合指標，包括房地產價格、住房可購性等，為一般公眾。

52
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:49,450
the volume of property transactions, the supply of residential properties overall, and of course mortgage payments and and rent to income ratios.

53
00:08:50,140 --> 00:09:01,250
The demand-side management measures are extraordinary measures. I've said this before, and I have to I have to repeat it. I'm I'm afraid, introduced under the current exceptional circumstances.

54
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:07,920
我們會考慮撤銷這些措施，之後，的供應情況在房地產市場已經恢復平衡。

55
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:28,310
Accordingly, and to allow us to do so quickly, we have proposed in the bill that adjustments to the special stamp duty and by stamp duty rates should be made by means of subsidiary legislation subject to negative vetting by the legislative council, and this will give us the necessary flexibility to adjust the applicable rates and indeed to.

56
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:48,320
Zero, if necessary, in a timely manner with reference to the market situation. Madam Chairman, we are still coordinating some responses to the other questions that were passed to us by members and the deputations on the 18th of February, as well as questions sent to us by the legal advisers on the 20th of February, and we.

57
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,600
We will revert as soon as possible, but we obviously remain happy to try and answer members' questions here today.

58
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,170
好，唔該曬，Duncan，誒，陶瑾新議員。

59
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,730
我建議都係五分鐘先啦，睇下有冇其他議員提問嚇。

60
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,800
哇！誒主席，就誒個文件應該係五九八啦，係嘛？

61
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,430
係。O.K.嗰個附件一。

62
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,260
就我對唔住我，或者我可唔可以政府可唔可以幫我哋睇一睇？誒，又是係負責做呢個表嘅嗰啲。

63
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,820
即係同時咧，就係誒點樣將呢扎數字同。

64
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,020
誒喺上一次會，即係五一一啊！

65
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,870
嗰份文件嘅附件一嗰度嚟到誒。

66
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,840
嚟到誒，即係誒。

67
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,170
吻合到啦嚇，即係睇，因為我睇到有啲數字好似唔係好同嘅。

68
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:52,110
咁誒，希望或者我先可唔好畀機會，即係政府嘅官員，可唔可以講講你教一教我哋睇呢個附件一嗰個表誒裏邊嘅好嘛？

69
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,170
係，副誒即係誒，我講係誒五九八嗰個先啦嚇，嚇，即係而家今次嗰個。

70
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,490
短短誒誒中文叫短期轉售個案比例。

71
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
係。

72
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:29,330
係誒？請問政府當局邊位答呢個問題咧？誒，黃局長係嘛？係好咁誒。陶議員所講嗰份附件一咧，就喺立法會嘅文件C B一五九二short十二hifer十三零二嗰份文件啊。咁附件一咧就叫表一A咧，就係短期轉售個案比例。

73
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,710
咁裏邊就。

74
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,410
係一啲住宅嘅轉售個案，咁最左手邊嘅年份啦，噉。

75
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:47,290
誒中第隔離第二行就係個住宅買賣合約數字，就係呢個係我哋離印税印花税署收到嘅買賣合約咁嚟打印花嘅宗數，咁跟住。

76
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,650
有一個大嘅標題，就係叫轉售個案啦。

77
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:02,790
噉就係喺即係話，譬如say二零一零年九千零四一宗裏邊拎嚟打嚟印印花嘅買合約裏邊，我哋分咗有幾多係用確認人身份，即係所謂摩貨。

78
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:23,100
嘅個案，跟住有三個直行咧，就係誒短過六個月嘅，即係佢係真係買入咗做咗大契之後再賣出去嘅短過六個月嘅持有期，跟住就係六至十二個持有期，十二至二十四個月嘅持有期。咁呢四條數加埋咧，二一七六五一四。

79
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,000
七二七一五加埋就係二零五。

80
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,040
個數啦，噉就係佔。

81
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,400
九零四一，不過百分比就二十二點七三，九零四一咧。

82
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,190
睇翻個柱三咧，嗱，我度打錯咗個字嘅嚇，應該係柱三嘅最尾嗰個係，噉就係誒。

83
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:58,580
十月起計嘅數字，因為一個措施係喺誒十誒十一月十月先宣佈嘅，所以用十月做個呢個打橫睇行二零一零嘅就係十月嘅數字。咁二零一一咧就九六零三四個數字咧就係二零一一年一月至十二月全年。

84
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:16,600
啊嘅買賣協議嘅數目，咁同樣分咗四類啦，就係摩貨啦、短過六個月嘅交易嘅數目啦，六至十二個月同埋十二至廿四個月交易，咁總數一百零零六，咁佔當年嘅總成交額就係百分之十八點七五。

85
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,680
咁一零一二年都係噉樣嘅情況。

86
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:33,480
噉就住呢度，想問議員誒，仲有冇問題先？如果冇問題，我就改翻去另外一份文件啦。阿陶議員，誒主席，誒政府係咪即係意思係咪話嗱？因為A嗰度咧就係所有住宅物業嘅買賣數字啦。

87
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,290
誒小計B嗰度咧。

88
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,290
就係轉售個案，就轉售嘅意思咧，即係誒。

89
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,430
廿四個月內轉手啦！

90
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,420
噉，但係誒確認，仍然有機會可以超過廿四個月㗎。

91
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,000
嗰個確認人即係嗰個可能機會超過廿四個月嘅。

92
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:09,780
哦，OK，OK，我我明你講咩，OK，咁誒誒好啦，B B over A係咪即係政府即係話會呢扎就係炒賣嘅個案啊？係咪咁？即係你係咪想意思即係噉啊？即係呢個轉讓就即係炒賣係咪噉啊？

93
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:22,290
啊，局長。誒嗱，依個係短期轉售，我哋唔係話炒賣啊，即係係廿四個月之內。不過好大嘅程度可以講係有機會係炒賣。

94
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,470
因為法例上邊炒迷霧嘅定義㗎。啊，係明白，即係即係誒誒，你哋會留意有可能嘅誒。

95
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,900
或者誒炒賣嘅誒收税啊嗰啲個角度去睇，噉啊係咪噉嘅意思啊？

96
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,650
誒局方係咪有有補充，Alice？

97
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:58,100
我諗其實呢個表咧，我哋就冇話過一定係炒賣嘅。不過就係呢啲，因為係佢嗰個係由由六個月去到廿四個月啦。咁根據而家嗰個SSD嗰個regime咧，就係佢係會有機會咧係要交SSD。其實個意義係噉樣咯。

98
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,160
但係我見到嗱，我我想咁咁睇咧，就注意嗰度咧，就話。

99
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,540
其實係有可能，佢好耐好耐之前。

100
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,140
誒買咗而唔需要交S S D嘅喎。

101
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,510
佢有咁有幾多度咧？我就想問，即係即係嗰個呢個比例都幾緊要喎，係嘛？

102
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,510
誒邊位回應咧？即係注意嗰個。

103
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,190
比例。

104
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:46,080
因為其實我哋而家呢個表咧係因應翻，即係當日即係議員們要求我哋係畀個短期轉售嘅個案，咁所以我哋因應嗰個要求咧就將個表列咗出嚟。噉我諗議員係講得啱嘅，即係話呢個只係講翻咧就係個轉售嗰個個案當中有部分係需要即係有機會要交S S D啦。咁但係我哋就冇喺呢度再細。

105
00:15:46,080 --> 00:16:06,090
分，因為當日即係冇要求我哋畀呢個再細分嘅breakdown咧，就係話會唔會嗰個物業其實咧就係喺第一次嗰個誒SSD即係引進嗰時候，根本佢已經係之前嘅物業嚟㗎啦，有機會冇唔需要交咧咁喺呢度我哋就冇畀咗嗰個breakdown，因為當時嗰個要求冇叫我哋做呢個breakdown。唔係，我舉一個。

106
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,090
係啫，即係有冇一個可能誒？我對測試即係極端啲噉啊！佢係買咗五十年㗎啦。

107
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:24,070
咁一個咧就係佢就啱啱你S S D誒嗰個二零一零年十月開始咧，佢可能就誒某一個機會，佢覺得個價啱啦，咁賣咗出去，會唔會喺呢度裏邊咧？

108
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:36,930
因為我見到你resale cases within twenty four months after assignment，咁嗰個after assignment，如果如果我舉舉頭先個例子，五十年前買入，然後係二零一一賣出嘅，噉係一定包唔到嘅，係嘛？

109
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,760
即係變咗你廿四個月一定係由最多由二零一二年嘅。

110
00:16:42,050 --> 00:17:02,060
誒，譬如嗰個誒七三八二嗰個嗰個數字啦嚇，七三八二係得一個啫，七三八二係一定咧係講緊二零一二年十月三十一號減翻兩年前就做assignment嗰個case啫，就唔會話五十年前買入二零一二年年尾賣出咧，就唔會包到喺七三八二嗰度，係咪噉啊？

111
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,610
唔知。

112
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:24,300
黃山係嘛？七三八二個數咧，咁如果用翻誒，議員講嘅例子，如果五十年前買入咗咧，噉就應該唔會包入去嘅。但係七三八二兩年，即係因為係由一月開始計去到十二月嘅，咁有啲可能係一月嘅個案咧，噉就係一月裏邊倒數翻兩年前㗎啦。哦，O K，即係最多係嗰兩誒誒嗰個日子嘅。

113
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,060
兩年前。

114
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,980
冇錯，OK明白。咁至於話即係要交印花税，其實咧下邊嗰部分表一B就係。

115
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:43,430
即係一零年有個建議，一一年通過咗法例要徵收額外印花税。由嗰陣時打計開始計到一二年底，裏邊就一千八百三十個個按照交額外印花税。

116
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,410
好，噉我哋大家再睇睇個表啦。噉啊，謝偉全議員。

117
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:57,470
誒多謝主席。誒我都想即係睇翻嗰個附表一咧，即係個附件一嘅時候咧，我從嗰啲數字睇咧。

118
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:08,170
其實因為上次傾開咧，就話即係誒點解將呢個特別印花額外印花税咧，將個期限咧就即係由二十四個月變到三十六個月咧？

119
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:17,920
噉我唔知啱唔啱。我分析咧，其實睇呢啲噉嘅成交數咧，其實即係我睇到咧，即係有呢個額外印花税之後咧。

120
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,030
嗰個誒六個月，同埋六個月至十二個月咧。

121
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,000
嗰個誒。

122
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,380
成交嗰度咧就係減少嘅，幾大幅減少嘅。

123
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:46,510
但係就十二個月至廿四個月咧，就係誒相對嚟講咧，就係減少嘅較為輕微。咁呢樣嘢咧，其實我會覺得咧，就唔係因為時間嘅問題，係因為你嗰個嗰個税率嘅問題。

124
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,340
因為你個税率咧，我相信影響最大，時間最長。

125
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:01,110
去到廿四個月，因為過往廿四個月咧，嗰個成交同埋個市場嘅變化咧，其實嗰個物業咧係升嘅。

126
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:21,400
咁啲人嚟講咧，廿四個月你百分之五啫嘛，咁冇所謂啦，因為都賺咗啦噉樣。咁所以點解咧？我覺得最大嘅問題咧，你要去打擊所謂一啲短期嘅炒賣。短期當然我哋就要諗咩叫短期啦，係嘛？而家廿四個月就短期。噉啊，而家就可能正。

127
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:31,810
府就諗廿四個月都唔係短期喎，三十六個月噉樣。咁呢個我我始終都係唔信服嗰個理據，點解即係三十六個月？其實最緊要咧，你係加嗰個。

128
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:43,530
誒税率，我認為個税率咧就誒即係最緊要嘅。咁呢個呢個我就第一點咧，即係睇我即係我覺得嘅分析咧，睇下誒會主要啊啊啊。

129
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:53,060
啊啊！畀誒呢個呢個呢個政府方面有咩即係或者佢嘅睇法啦？咁另外咧就我頭先誒。

130
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:13,660
柏志高先生咧，亦都講過誒，關於嗰個重建咧嚇，你唔希望咧，就因為呢啲特別嘅税咧，就令到重建嗰方面咧就係減慢，或者嗰啲私人方面嘅發展商咧參與重建咁誒呢方面咧，所以你有一個所謂誒，即係個誒誒退。

131
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:33,670
追回嗰個印花税嗰個嗰個特別印花税嗰個嗰個措施嘅，咁但係我覺得咧就一樣嘢咧，你話雖然你話收購，如果收購曬咧，然後先開始計六年，咁但係始終咧由收購開始咧第一間啊，收購到到六年之後咧，凍絕咧，我諗都可能誒最。

132
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:46,800
短到我諗八年甚至上十年啦，咁其實即係好多都係。咁呢度咧，其實我覺得咧，就或者政府有冇考慮咧，其實喺嗰個誒即係退回印花税嘅時限咧？

133
00:20:47,300 --> 00:21:02,000
係縮短到啦，譬如佢收購完成啦，拆曬樓啦，咁其實都已經係一個好強烈嘅，誒，即係誒誒嘅，畀大家睇咧，佢其實係會重重建嘅，或者佢批咗積啊等等。

134
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:22,290
咁咧，因為點解咧？百分之十五咧，其實嗰個數字咧，即係個即係買家印花税咧，其實咧都幾多錢下嘅。因為通常我哋收購都係用公司收購，咁呢方面咧就其實都差唔多有可以支付大部分嗰個建築費。咁對一個發展商嚟講咧，其實喺呢方面咧嗰個承擔。

135
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:29,960
其實好大嘅，咁呢方面咧，我就即係提呢個意見咧，係政府可唔可以考慮咧？噉樣，噉啊兩個問題，唔該。

136
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:50,350
Duncan, please. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Let me deal with the last one first. If you see what I mean, the the trigger for the six year count is when they complete the acquisition, not when they start the acquisition. As you're you're absolutely right, it will take a while, maybe five or ten.

137
00:21:50,350 --> 00:22:10,360
ten years even before they they've got the whole of a block or blocks so we don't start the count until they've done that that's the first point I think that's a and I agree with you that's the appropriate trigger they've got to acquire the whole thing the second point which again I don't disagree with you is we need to be satisfied that they are

138
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,800
doing the redevelopment.

139
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:32,090
所以，our our intention is that when that occupation permit for the first block, if it's a multiple block development, they can apply for the the reimbursement at the point at which they get that occupation permit for the first block, in the redevelopment. So I think we're actually more or less aligned here. Yeah, I think.

140
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:52,100
主席，我當然我理解政府所提出的建議，但我的觀點是因為從開始的併購，試圖將所有股權合併，最多六年，六年，現在設限，六年，六年，六年。

141
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,860
Actually，completion of the development.

142
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:11,600
Talking about over ten years, you know, the holding of fifteen per cent really have been caused a lot of burden on the developers, and that's why that would discourage the private developer in you know participate urban renewal project.

143
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,780
This is my point. I I understand the point, and I I would suggest that, of course, by now, and.

144
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:40,070
presumably from the date at which this announcement was made, many developers will already have secured many of the properties they need. So the chances are this would only apply to the residual, maybe five percent or ten percent of properties that they still have to acquire. So it's not as if they haven't already locked up money for a long time. You look at

145
00:23:40,070 --> 00:24:00,080
發展在旺角，一些開發商已經在旺角重開發工作了20年。是的，如果這種措施會會會中止，你知道在很短的時間內，但我懷疑，因為政府在政府方面，他們沒有説你知道你知道多久會有這種特殊的。

146
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,670
Tax.

147
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,920
我試。

148
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Well, again, we've given a very firm undertaking that this is not a permanent situation. We will be taking it away when the market changes. What I can't do is say when that market situation will change. But I do assure you that this is not a permanent arrangement. It's exceptional for these exceptional circumstances.

149
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,140
Madam Chairman, I'm aware of the time, but if if you would like, I can perhaps address the other two points as well briefly. I think.

150
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,300
誒，而家仲有石禮謙議員，不如等佢先答埋先啦，好嘛？

151
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:46,920
主席，啊好啦，噉啊，石禮謙議員，主席啊，頭先佢答阿謝阿謝議員嗰度咧，佢話即係如果一齣呢個S S D嗰度咧，就冚落去應該買曬，所以佢都係發緊夢㗎。

152
00:24:47,310 --> 00:25:07,320
市區重建係唔會一個時間就會住完嘅。市區重建係一個一路咁繼續落去，一路咁去做嘅。所以唔係你你出依個你出依個政策出嚟噉啊，以後唔使做啊，唔係噉嘅，主席。所以咧，啲官員咧，有時啲嘢咧就唔能喺即係即係同即係同個社會脱節咗。

153
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,390
又冇去問過業界。

154
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:27,400
即係個市，你而家六年，你收樓，你而家你試下收間收幾棟舊樓啦，係收好長嘅時間，主席，好長嘅時間唔係你收完一棟，你又收第二棟，咁去咧，搞到咧唔係淨係六年啊，要挺到十六年後你先可以攞翻。

155
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:47,710
攞翻嗰啲錢啊！十六年後咧，成十五個percent，一路咁吸，一路咁去compounding上去啊！唔使做㗎啦，主席。噉係咪我咁？即係好簡單啫。係咪淨係可以市市建局先可以噉啊？市建局做到點啊？因為佢畫畫出嚟一個計劃出嚟，就賣欠報噉，咪去收。

156
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,170
噉啊，修完咧就係依個成個係為咗市建局去做。

157
00:25:51,670 --> 00:26:11,680
唔係唔係普普通嘅私人嘅誒發展商去做，我我唔係呢個問題，即係我只係頭先去答嗰個咧，就係係混帳嘅主席。第二樣我想問咧，就我又睇翻去N X A嗰度，頭先啊，淘緊新聞嗰度，先或者我睇下啊啊啊啊啊邊個可以答一答我借啊？

158
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,340
謝生定係黃生？

159
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,510
打不打我咧？就係譬如而家有一個老婆。

160
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,670
去落訂買間樓。

161
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
然後咧，去簽。

162
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,490
先呢個嗰個，所以最誒誒個正式契、正式買賣合約嗰陣時咧，加咗佢老公嘅名。

163
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:49,780
噉佢哋有冇當咗喺嗰個附件一嗰度個表嗰度嗰啲買賣轉手咧？佢嚇會set。如果你睇個情況咧，就係set一半份㗎咯。噉佢計翻落去啦嚇。佢有冇噉啊？第一答我依個問題先。如果有，咪所以咁大咯，主席。好多陣時個老婆買。

164
00:26:49,780 --> 00:27:09,790
買完啦，簽完個臨時買藥架就係中嚇。Final final啊，誒Signing嗰時就簽，噉佢又計咗落去。另外咧，睇一睇上邊個表同埋下低個表啦。佢臨佢一一係廿四個月買賣嘅，你睇翻咧嚇一一B嗰度咧，誒同埋個N X A嗰一B嗰度咧，佢。

165
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:29,800
成咁耐咧，就只有一千八百三十六樽誒誒誒，中係畀依個S S D嘅啫，同上邊啲數咧冚唪唥完全都唔同嘅，主席。即係有時你睇睇呢啲數咧，都唔知佢想講乜嘢，係點去做，因為呢啲S S D咧，你睇一B嗰度你講得好清楚，但係你睇完。

166
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:37,540
咧一個一A嗰度咧，嗰啲數咧，係唔行走嚟走去，係你冇可能咧，你話可以。

167
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:45,660
夾到嘅主席，即係你明白我講嘅，我我一個專家喺呢樣嘢都唔睇到嘅咧，係唔係專家嘅咧，都幾大問題，主席。

168
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,440
好啊，邊位答咧？係啊，黃生係上次先答啲數字係嘛？係誒，依兩個表咧都係因應翻上一次會議誒，即係要求我哋準備嘅。咁誒，N X A即係話嘅附表一裏邊嘅一。

169
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:20,940
A呢個表咧就係純粹係講到一啲短期轉售嘅個案，咁即係話我已經解釋咗一次㗎啦。咁下邊嗰個咧就係話呢個係自從誒有個額外印花税生效咗之後，喺攞入嚟誒攞啲誒買合約上嚟係誒打印花嘅，而係要。

170
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:40,950
徵收額外印花税嘅個案嘅，所以係少會少過上邊嗰個嘅。因為正話我講到咧，即係第二即係表一A嘅注意喺Note Two裏邊講到咧，包括咗一啲係喺法例生效之前買入嘅物業，所以一部分物業唔需要交額外印花税，但係因為順英因正議員嘅邀。

171
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,580
要求我哋顯示到。

172
00:28:43,430 --> 00:29:03,440
最多廿四個月嘅，即係佢答唔答我係咪佢老公老婆嗰啲喺表一A嗰度係咪點點處置佢？我跟住會答佢問題。係嗰部分啊，黃生係。係啦，因為喺現行裏邊咧，即係話誒丈夫太太名佢簽一個臨時買賣合約，到到正式買賣合約就加咗個丈夫嘅名上去咧，依種情。

173
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:23,450
房咧係免交嗰個印花税，所以我哋冇計到在內嘅，即係用九一二六四呢個鐘數咧就唔會包呢啲嘅，即係當一張買賣合約咁啫。所以一A嗰度咧就係咁去解釋。主要睇完一A咧，你睇到一B嗰度，一B嗰度咧由一九二零一一年、二零一二年加埋曬去總共嘅轉誒成交啦。

174
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:43,460
一手樓、二手樓咧，就係十八萬咁上下，十八萬中咁上下，兩年九萬、九萬六同埋九萬一嚇，係嗰度就咁咧。你如果淨係睇翻佢一B嗰度咧，一一一千八百三十六個喺十誒十八萬嗰度嘅係係第一兩個。

175
00:29:43,460 --> 00:30:03,470
percent噉，為咗嗰兩個percent就搞咁多嘢，係咪值唔值得咧？主席，呢兩個percent搞咁多嘢咧，就谷高曬，令到嗰個你睇一睇嗰個一個喺嗰啲誒成交度九萬六跌到九萬一，由二零一零年嗰陣時咧就係十五萬五嘅跌咗四十個percent。好似阿阿田議員上一趟講你咧。

176
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:23,480
令到成個市咧，誒，依個S S D只可買不可賣，就嗰個供應咧就少咗好多啦。一少咗好多咧，就擠高曬個價。個S S D咧就益咗邊啲咧？益咗地產商。因為你睇翻睇依兩年嘅地產商個供應咧係係穩定嘅，萬一萬二嘅咁咧。

177
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,510
但係起個價咧，就起咗成。

178
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:36,750
即係整體個價咧，就上咗三十五個percent。就咁去咁去睇，咁邊個影響到咧？又係市民影響到啦。你睇一睇，依個係幫唔到市民，定係咧間接做咗個假事。

179
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:57,040
假是令到嗰陣時，咁呢十八萬買樓嗰啲人咧，亦影響曬成個成個嘅誒影響咧買貴樓啦，買得貴咗成衰啲三啊五個percent。噉你睇翻咧成個S S D啊，得咗一千八百三十六樽中啦，係一係唔成功，但係成功咧就。

180
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,610
高咗個價子，令到嗰個啲供應咧就減低曬。

181
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,760
Duncan， do you have any response?

182
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:25,060
I clearly don't agree with that analysis at all. I think what Table One B shows is that people have been very rational and they haven't rushed in to resell properties early, which is exactly what we wanted to achieve through special stamp duty. So I would argue this has had its effect. But I would also argue against the the

183
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:45,070
分析，這在某些方式影響了市場的供應。你可以看到，96,000、91,000等，數量的交易在市場沒有受到顯著影響。所以我不同意這個觀點。主席女士，Prescott不需要同意任何東西。他只需要看事實。

184
00:31:45,070 --> 00:32:05,080
But if he want to close his eyes to the facts, then it's a different issue. My my argument is that the price has actually went up 35% over the over the two years period, 2011 and 2012, and that's a fact. And also is a fact that the

185
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:25,090
Primary supply of new flats has remained steady. The supply of secondary flats have actually dwindled down from 155,000 to 96 and 91,000 in the year 2011-2012. If you add the two together, you can see that there has been a control in the supply.

186
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:35,320
因為很多的secondary market，因為這個SSD，不願意放到市場，所以因為供應量有限，的進入市場。

187
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,110
then the price of actually of flats went up correspondingly.

188
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:49,140
And that is also a fact, but doesn't matter. He doesn't have to agree. No government official agree with what I said, but what I said is.

189
00:32:49,950 --> 00:33:09,960
Occasionally, I do agree with any comment. Yes, I think it's it's actually very very dangerous to try and equate one measure to the total cause for increase in prices. Let's be frank: the influx of money from overseas has a far far bigger impact than the small impact of special stamp duty.

190
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:27,050
增加一啲

191
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,470
好，阿陶瑾新議員。

192
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,390
誒，主席，或者我誒問翻誒誒附件一，即係呢個五九八呢個文件啦。

193
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:48,350
誒誒，又是問阿黃生啦。嗱，即係我哋先誒跟翻阿實體員個問題，就係譬如話嗰度你有一行啊，即係中文嚇一A嗰度第三第三個column咧，就係確認人轉手啊嘛。

194
00:33:49,250 --> 00:34:06,790
你睇到啊？OK，好啊。咁譬如如果我用翻嗰個例子，就係譬如誒個誒太太去誒簽嗰個preliminary，即係誒初初步合約，然後個老誒老公咧就誒加埋個名落去喺個正式合約，即係兩個人啦，兩公婆啦。

195
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:18,840
噉係咪即係你呢個係當係確認人轉售咗半份，所以就會係出現喺呢度，譬如二九六啊或者八八三啊嗰啲嗰度number裏邊係咪會嘅？

196
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:30,810
阿黃生，因為雖然佢唔使打S M D誒S S D啦，但係其實係出現咗呢度係咪啊？有冇咧？係冇嘅，我哋冇計呢啲嘅個案嘅。頭先佢答咗都冇計。但係咁點解唔計咧？

197
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:44,820
因為喺我哋個印花税條例裏邊第一個附表咧，如果係即係誒夫婦關係啊、父母啊之類咧，就等等等同一張合約嘅啫。我哋喺我哋嚟。哦，OK。

198
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,830
即係，所以你而家呢個二九六八八三咧，一定係嗰啲舉例係誒誒誒誒誒。

199
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,940
有可能係佢好耐之前買。

200
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:16,640
但係，但係呢度會唔會呢個確認人轉售一定要打S S D咧？裏邊有冇咧？又唔係一定係咪？可唔可以解釋一下咧，黃生？好誒，確認人最主要所謂摩火咧，即係話佢簽咗一張臨時買賣又好，或者正式買賣又好咧，但係係未成交嘅。未成交之後咧，佢就轉手。

201
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:31,160
賣咗出去，噉就屬於呢個確認個案，噉就唔理我哋呢就冇計佢話係廿四個月以內或者以外嘅，嚇。係咯，嗱冇計㗎呢個。係咯，咁嗱當然啦，誒我我哋有理由相信呢度全大多絕大多數應該唔係。

202
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:43,570
唔係廿四個月以外啦，咁其實如果唔係咧，就應該係好多都要打S S D㗎啦，係咪啊？係咯，有咩例子係佢可以豁免S S D咧？如果係確認人嘅話，等下先。

203
00:35:44,700 --> 00:36:02,630
因為要都係睇佢係咪買入嚟嗰陣時，即係佢譬如第一手阿A係買入咗一個單位簽咗個買合約，咁跟住佢賣畀阿B，咁睇下A賣畀B嗰陣時，B買入嗰陣時咧係咪喺個條例生效，即係二零一零年十一月以後生效之後買簽呢個買合約嘅？如果係嘅咧，

204
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,200
佢又有機會。

205
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:24,880
會交呢個印花税，即係所以咧，其實一A咧就唔係好容易睇到好多端倪，即係一B咧就係最後真係要打啦嘛，就係千八宗咯，噉就係就係啊石顯明所講嘅十十八萬十九萬宗嘅一千八百卅六宗啦。嗱，但係我我想講反而咁諗啊，即係我我要評估究竟你嗰

206
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:44,890
嗰個S.S.D.誒係咪有效咧？我用誒附件一嗰度咧，同政府切磋下嗱。你你用誒二零一零年嘅第三個誒洞啊column就係少過六個月嗰度嗱。當然我知道呢啲唔係全部S.S.D.㗎嚇，即係因為你講咗啦附誒誒注意嗰度嗱嗰度其實。

207
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:58,370
你係二零一零年十二月係一個月嘅啫，係咪？因為你係十二月份開始統計收集有有關數字啊嘛。好啦，咁即係換句話講，例如嗰個六五一啊，即係二零一零年十二月係六百五十一宗，短過六個月嘅。

208
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:04,650
如果我用成大約啊，大約成十二個月咧，就即係七萬誒七千六百宗。

209
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:22,150
如果你睇翻二零一一年咧，就係二六一七宗；二零一二年咧，係八十三宗。嗱，當然我唔係話嗰個七千六宗，大約如果二零一年成年，二零一一年二千六宗或者二零一二八十三，都係要打S S C或者唔使。

210
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,210
但係好明顯咧，就係後邊啊，即係二零一一同一二年嗰度轉售咧。

211
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,880
要打SSD嘅機會就大好多啦。

212
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:42,130
二零一零年就細好多啦。如果你睇翻個趨勢咁計咧，即係話，因為有S S D之後咧，哇，好勁啊！你個措施就變咗二零一二年得翻八十三宗轉售個案。

213
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:56,720
我懷疑嗰八十三宗咧，即係好可能咧就已經係誒八十三宗或者八二宗都係要打㗎啦，即係即係即係係嘛，即係噉樣，因為六個月內啊嘛，噉你嗰度話廿四個月內，咁即係換句話講咧，其實你嗰個。

214
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,220
S S D咧。

215
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,070
就係。

216
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,510
正將正常。

217
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,340
有可能轉售嘅個案咧。

218
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,370
我用轉售，係壓到好低、好低嘅個案。

219
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:27,120
就因為六個月啊，打十五percent啊嘛，噉啊好成功咯。嗱，而家咧，我哋而家處一個狀態咧，就係政府要我哋話將呢個十五percent六個月就加到幾多啊？二十啊，二二十定廿五啊？唔記得咗啦嚇，即係再再加高啦噉。

220
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:35,210
噉我諗下，即係你你話嗰個效力已經淡化咗嘛？咁如果仲你睇啲行點會淡化咗啫？

221
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,780
即係，你除非你話哦，我八十三。

222
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,950
我舉例，你而家呢幾個月啦，二零一三啦嚇，你話唔係啊，陶生。

223
00:38:44,420 --> 00:39:04,430
淨係兩個月咋，就已經八十宗噉。你project上去，哇，真係好犀利喎，好多喎，因為淡化咗啦噉樣，係唔係咧？如果唔係噉，你你你其實就已經非常成功啦。咁非常成功，你再將十五加到二十、三十五、十，係梗係會少啲啦。可能八十三再變變變到四十五咁噉，但係。

224
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,450
我係咪要？我哋係咪要噉樣噉樣嘅角度嚟到增加咧？

225
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:26,660
Madam Chairman, yes, I actually agree with the the basic analysis that SSD has been successful. But I think you need to read the column across rather than up and down. So, for example, in 2012, the number of resale cases within

226
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:45,790
六個月，83是，但係是 still quite small，168 still quite small，但係突然間 it jumps up to 7,000， and I think that very very clearly shows the diminishing impact the longer you get away from when you originally bought the property， and that's the point that we really need to address。 so

227
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:54,940
the the essential thing here is if you accept, and I think the figures speak for themselves in this case, that

228
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:15,330
There is still a considerable number of resales within 12 to 24 months. You need to address that problem. So that is the first problem we want to address. We accept that to do so, you need to put the rate up for that period. And if you put the rate up for that period, clearly it has to have a proportionate increase across the board to make it a valid

229
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:25,190
approach， the second question then and and it's the second part of the objective with special stamp duty， is， do we think that， 12

230
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:45,480
24 months is sufficient. Well, we think that in fact, because of the nature of the market that's been continuously overheated, that we need to extend the cooling effect that we now see from these figures up to the between the 24 to 36 months. So there's two elements here. The first part is.

231
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:53,200
We want to enhance the impact in that latter 12 to 24 month period, and we want to continue that impact up to 36 months.

232
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:06,160
只這一句啫。咁如果係即用你嗰個講法，你其實嗰個效果應該就係加十二至廿四個月嗰度，就唔係再喐六個月、六個至十二個月，因為嗰個數係細到。

233
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:26,450
細到唔唔知點講啦，係真係好細啊！細到係咪頭先佢都係咁回應啦，係嘛？阿登記，你識要，但係你唔係嘛？你而家六個月嗰度都加嘛？係，但係佢話按比例前邊又加埋啊嘛，係咪噉嘅意思咧？嗯，係下得呢個。Yes, as as I said, what we're saying is that in order to keep the proportional impact.

234
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:46,460
relatively the same. If you put the last period, which was previously 5%, up to 10%, then you should naturally increase 10 to 15 and 15 to 20. And that's that's the approach. And then of course, the latter period 10%. If we know 5% has no effect, there's no point in putting it 5%.

235
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:55,290
唔係啊！主席，你你個你嗰個税率係夠造成阻阻礙阻嚇，你就係夠啦嘛。

236
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:01,490
嗱，如果你keep翻十五個percent六個月，其實你已經係打到冇人會做啦，已經。

237
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:13,040
噉你就唔需要再話後，因為後邊十二至廿四個月加咗咧，六個月嗰度一定要加加高，唔一定要加高啊？點解一定要加高啫？佢根本個阻嚇已經喺度，已經夠啦，已經足夠啦，噉啊！

238
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:33,330
或者政府翻去諗一諗呢個問題啊。As I say, yes, I I think the point that we're trying to make here is that we believe that the deterrent effect has been diminishing over time, and the figures actually do show that as well. And that in order to maintain the deterrent effect across the board for both for both immediate sales below six months.

239
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:39,610
Right through to the 36 months, it has to have an increased deterrent effect, and that's the approach we've adopted.

240
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:49,830
好，嗯，而家未有議員表示要發言。好啊，噉就係阿謝偉全議員先啦。

241
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:55,540
多謝主席，因為我頭先咧都想話，即係分析下嗰個附件一嗰度咧。

242
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,130
嗱，附件一之中咧，二零一二年咧。

243
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,920
就佢十二個月，去到二十四個月嗰度咧。

244
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:14,380
就呢度有冇一個即係就冇一個誒，即係將佢分開咧？其實裏邊咧，可能有部分咧就唔受嗰個額外印花税。

245
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:34,110
因為咧，佢嗰個印花税咧就係二零一零年十一月二十號開始嘅。嗰個分鐘咧，有啲喺誒嗰段時間賣嘅時候咧，可能係超過誒，即係即係係係係誒之前嘅佢買嘅。咁呢，如果有個有個分析咧，就會知道。不過我睇睇埋一B個表咧。

246
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:46,570
就加埋咧，其實都係一千八百幾宗，咁即係話咧，其實咧呢個額外印花税走咗出嚟咧，其實嗰個即係可以咁講咧，其實。

247
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,540
誒，如果係喺嗰個限制嘅時間內賣嘅，其實咧～

248
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,270
就減少咗好多嘅。

249
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:01,750
咁呢樣嘢就正係我哋擔心咧，你將佢整到三啊六個月嘅時候咧，搞到啲供應咧又少咗啲。

250
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:16,380
噉你梗係打擊咗嗰啲短炒啦，但係你供應少咗咧，就令到而家個市場咧嗰個居高不下嗰個價錢，反而咧又升添。呢個都係直接嗰個經濟。

251
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:25,480
供求問題啊嘛，所以我都想佢哋分析，唔好冒冒然咧，話三十六個月，再唔得係四啊八個月，六十個月。

252
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:45,850
咩叫短期咧？我其實唔清楚啊，即係因為從來冇講啊。即係阿阿阿柏志高先生就講話誒列咗羅列咗嗰啲數據，嗰啲數據咧到時都係佢哋講嘅啫。即係話咧，當個情況好轉啊，咩叫好轉咧？又唔知噉。其實我哋當然啦，即係有彈性之外咧，都起碼等個市場知。

253
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:58,230
知道下啊咩叫短期，或者政府有咩信心，佢做一啲政策，佢呢個市場會正常化。譬如你話，我諗跟依政策我做落去咧。

254
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:07,780
五年好個市場會正常化㗎啦，咁咁起碼我哋知啊，唔係綁死你五年五年，因為個嗰個嗰個環境會變嘅。

255
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:27,010
所以我對呢樣嘢咧，我就係始終都覺得冒冒然咧，你將佢變為卅六個月咧，我又好擔心啦。到時咧仲少啲供應，個價一樣升，但啲人買樓當然嗰個成交量啊低啦嚇。唔知有冇嗰啲分析數據？係，誒，減少供應方面嘅回應係嘛？

256
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:47,400
兩點，這些是需求側措施，它們apply to the demand side。它們，它們

257
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:58,490
The number of units that are available on the market doesn't change significantly because you take out a small number of people buying. It just means that those units are not bought quickly. That's all.

258
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:06,450
但第二個點係，Honestly，如果我知，當市場會轉轉round，Frankly，我唔應該做呢個職業。

259
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:13,540
因為我會 be able to make big money knowing that information. I don't think anybody knows. However, what I will say is that.

260
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,670
啊！

261
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,530
looking at the economic fundamentals, there is absolutely no question that the market will reverse.

262
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,490
There's no question. The market does that. It will reverse. It's just a question of time.

263
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:46,820
If you listen to the commentaries that are coming in from overseas, from the USA and what have you, Mr Bernanke for example is even suggesting that he's going to start moving interest rates up. When interest rates start going up, it will affect the market. Those are the factors that we have to look at. But I would be very unwise to give you a particular time frame.

264
00:46:46,820 --> 00:47:02,140
Because we just don't know. No, Madam Chairman, what I'm trying to, you know, get from the government side is really, you know, according to your plan. Of course, you introduce new measure, try to bring the market.

265
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,290
到正常情況。

266
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:16,710
Then of course, I think in your mind, when you draw up the plan, you must have a target date, or at least you think that you know roughly if all these measure is effective.

267
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,700
And you know, subject to of changes in the market, other factors.

268
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:36,090
Then probably you can achieve what you want within certain period of time. This first. And the second point, actually, I'm trying to point out is that if look at the figure, even look at you know year 2012.

269
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:40,190
你知唔知？啊，The transaction, the resale cases had.

270
00:47:40,470 --> 00:48:00,480
被 drastic reduced。 When you look at the column, six month, less than six month, and six month to twelve months, and then for the twelve to twenty four months, of course, you still got seven thousand something cases. But among these cases, I thought you know, most of them actually are not subject to SSD.

271
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:10,940
Because when you look at the table 1B, the total cases subject to SSD SSD is only 1,800 something.

272
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:25,060
I don't know whether my analysis is correct or not because you got all the figures. Yeah, I'll ask Richard to answer that second one. But can can I come back on the first one? When we introduce the the measures originally and

273
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:45,370
Enhance the measures and introduce BSD this time. The objective was to make a change in the market situation. It wasn't to be defined by a time frame. So, as I think I mentioned at the last Bills Committee, the trigger for us removing these measures will be a package of you know prices stabilising.

274
00:48:45,370 --> 00:49:05,380
The market situation changing. We're looking at this package of measures that I've described. We don't have a time frame in mind. I would like that we could say yes, it's a year, or yes, it's two years. But honestly, I can't do that because the fundamental impact on the market is external. Everybody knows that, and we don't control that.

275
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:25,520
所以，what we're trying to do is to deal with the demand side, but the other factors that we cannot control have a much bigger influence. So I'm afraid I really can't say that we had in mind a time frame. We didn't. We had a target in terms of the market situation. So Richard, perhaps you can answer the other question.胡志偉議員。

276
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,310
誒，多主席。

277
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:47,600
其實我我兩點嘅第一個咧，我想係即係誒政府話翻畀我聽，因為咧睇翻呢個附件二個表咧，當然二零一零年咧就有十四萬宗嘅係成交交易啦。咁跟住一路就因為呢個係引引進咗S S D之後咧，就係個成交量一路減少嘅。

278
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:53,330
其實你係咪即係會有一個估算咧？若跟你頭先個講法就係。

279
00:49:53,610 --> 00:50:13,620
誒，如果S S D嗰個效力係一路減少嘅時間咧，應該喺呢個二零一三年嘅時候，如果假設其他嘢都唔變嘅話咧，佢嗰個成交量咧就會係上翻嗰個上翻嗰一個係即係新嘅軌道，即係話或者某程度上喺市場上邊咧可以供出嚟係買賣嘅單位咧。

280
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,130
其實多咗好多嘅可以，噉。

281
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:36,420
咁變咗就係話，如果喺個市場上邊可供買賣嘅單位係係多咗嘅時間咧，其實我哋點樣樣係去去睇嗰個誒樓價，因為供應多咗嘅時間，似乎就應該正常嚟講係會令到嗰個市場咧係有個反應嘅。咁呢個第一點，第二個咧，我所問。

282
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:56,430
問下，因為其實而一同一時間咧，我另一樣嘢行緊嘅就係有關嗰個嘅係印花税咧，即係正常嘅係誒買樓嘅印花税咧，又有一個係即係增雙倍印花税出現咗啦。噉我又唔知你哋會唔會係將呢一個部分嘅係影響咧喺而家。

283
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:16,440
我哋講緊呢一個嘅係即係特別印花税呢個部分咧，係可以係有一個總體嘅資料我睇得到咧。因為如果唔係嘅話咧，其實我今日就傾呢一個係特別印花税或者係呢個首次即係呢一個係誒買家印花税。咁但係下一次我就即係好相約噉樣樣咧，又會又要係過咗呢一嚿嘢之後去睇。

284
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:36,450
另一個就係嗰個嘅係雙倍印花税嗰個影響，咁呢個對我哋成個審議都係好唔公道。我想問下，其實你哋會唔會有呢一方面嘅一個估算，就係話雙倍印花税喺而家呢一種嘅環境裏邊，佢所引生嘅影響，或者你哋個估算，或者係你個你嗰個嘅係即係誒係啦個估。

285
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,680
估算其實係點樣樣嘅一回事咧？

286
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,090
有啲機能。

287
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,860
邊位回應咧？

288
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,860
maybe I'll start, Madam Chairman. I think.

289
00:51:47,680 --> 00:52:04,470
There's no doubt that as more units come on the market on the supply side, we hope and expect that will have an effect on prices, and that's why we're putting so much effort in to try and get more supply both in the private market and the HOS market. I think that's absolutely right.

290
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:11,860
In terms of the impact of what I think, I think you're talking about the changes to the ad valorem stamp duty.

291
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:28,250
which is a slightly different thing. I I don't have those figures here with me to be honest with you, but perhaps we can we can look at those and give you a reply separately because I just don't have those figures. As I say, that's that's out with the the exercise today.

292
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:48,540
主席，我我我想，因為其實誒嗰個雙倍印花税都某程度上係一個係誒控制買家嗰個嘅行為嘅一個做法嚟嘅。噉我都想睇下，我哋會唔會喺即係誒嚟緊審議，或者喺呢度係夾埋一齊睇嗰件事，而令到我哋係對於呢一個嘅係印花税嘅安排咧。

293
00:52:48,540 --> 00:53:08,550
有一個比較上全面嘅係即係觀察。理論上咧，我哋就應該有另一個嘅法案委員會咧去處理嗰個誒加嘅印花税嘅，係緊勤啲。Madam Chairman, perhaps I can comment. Um, the the the government will be bringing forward legislation on that in due course, and and they're working very hard.

294
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:28,560
to bring that in, but in any case, the the proposals that we're dealing with today, the enhancement to special stamp duty and buy stamp duty, have specific targets that would apply regardless of the changes to the ad valorem stamp duty. So I think that they can still be considered separately, even though perhaps some some overlap. But

295
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:48,570
係，我哋遲啲會有法案委員會去處理嗰部分嘅喺會議員係唔係？我我諗兩個部分啦。第一個就係當然我哋誒用一用藥嘅話，有時我哋都要小心去衡量，就係用嘅藥會唔會係即係過分重而係即係傷及一啲即係市場上邊正常嘅係即係。

296
00:53:48,570 --> 00:54:08,580
誒交易啊，或者我哋用藥過重嘅時間咧，係影響咗成個誒市民想置業嗰個嘅基本嘅處境啦。咁呢個我當然要注意。第二個，我亦都要擔，我亦都要係即係瞭解下，就係話兩個法案嘅本身會唔會係有一個即係機會咧，係讓我哋可以同一時間兩面睇到，而唔會係即係有一個過咗。

297
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,410
然後先再去睇另一件事嗰個出現咧，噉樣樣。

298
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:33,880
誒，我相信咧，就誒中間咧，我哋一定會有機會誒討論嘅嗰個最近嗰個新嘅措施，但係未必喺本法案委員會啦。但係若然議員係要求之後誒當局準備好文件嘅時候，都向我哋提供咧，噉我相信係冇問題嘅，因為我我相信實有重疊嘅審議時間嘅。

299
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:42,120
我哋都不相信呢個法案委員會係可以喺短時間裏邊完成。阿Kenneth，你係咪？你係第一輪發言係。

300
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:50,270
多謝主席。Madam Chairman，我認為，經過看過附表A和附表B的數字，

301
00:54:50,550 --> 00:55:06,550
我諗經濟動力，的樓市市場喺香港係好複雜，我唔諗，正話，基本經濟理論，的供應和需求，會喺度完美運作。

302
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:15,520
作為一個有經濟學訓練的人，我認為我們並不是在處理易腐商品，例如蔬菜，於一個定義的市場。

303
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:27,030
The government obviously cannot control supply and demand at the same time, and even if it wants to control supply or expand supply, it will take a lead time of at least four to five years.

304
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:47,320
And definitely, it is not in a position to control demand either, because obviously, what you are doing here is just to increase the transaction costs for people who want to buy these goods called properties.

305
00:55:48,090 --> 00:56:08,100
and in fact I also observe another quite strange phenomenon is that even if you increase the transaction cost, namely special stamp duty here, it does not necessarily mean that the price could come down instantaneously because these are not perishable.

306
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,290
因為物質，因為物質會不斷地分解。

307
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,610
The assumption I'm making here is that.

308
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,430
The people who are selling their properties, they're not in dire need of cash.

309
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:40,720
And of course, I agree with also the observation that the price of property in Hong Kong, because it's such an open market, will be determined to a very large extent by the global interest rate, and that is the first you know thing which I think will affect.

310
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,540
The property market, which is outside, of course, the government's control.

311
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,890
嗯。

312
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:53,180
所以，after you know having all these observations，I've you know。

313
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,640
just one question.

314
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,230
啊！

315
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,480
有，政府。

316
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:09,950
done any regression analysis when you imposed a special stamp duty? Regression analysis meaning.

317
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:18,340
demand versus stamp duty increase, price sensitivity versus stamp duty increase. Thank you.

318
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:38,630
Yeah, perhaps I can comment and then answer. I think you're right. The biggest impact is the international context that we live in, because interest rates are not controlled in Hong Kong in this regard. But I would say that the philosophy behind the special stamp duty and, of course, the buyout.

319
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:58,640
Stam duty is to tackle very specific sectors in the marketplace. What we were deliberately trying to do, and I think in terms of the special stamp duty, we had the effect at least initially, but it has been wearing off, is to target these very short-term speculators. These are people who come in, they buy, they sell, they buy, they sell.

320
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:18,650
And by doing so, they create the impression that the market is much more dynamic than it is, and they drive up prices. We wanted to take those out of the market, and I think we've done that. But unfortunately, as I said, I think the impact has worn off as people have sort of factored that into their buying and selling preference. So I don't disagree with you in.

321
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:38,660
在一般分析上，但我想，你必須看到這個具體目標，我們正在努力處理，我相信我們成功了。在經濟分析上，是的，事實上，每次我們推出措施時，我們當然會經過一個非常詳細的過程。

322
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:58,670
Within government to look at the potential impact. The, for example, looking at the economic impact, will it have a one percent, two percent impact on GDP? For example, these sort of things. And in that context, we do do. I'm not sure because I'm not an economist exactly what the scale of those analyses are.

323
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,810
Carried out by the government economists for us, but I can assure you, we do do a very detailed economic analysis.

324
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:06,890
Ken，if you have。

325
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:27,180
主席啊，可唔可以叫佢哋即係局方，可唔可以畀到一啲即係經濟分析嘅資料畀我哋睇到咧？關於呢啲special stamp duty或者bus stamp duty，佢哋一定一定做過寫少經濟分析。即係我唔需要話一嚿好詳細嘅report。如果佢有一啲噉嘅數據畀我我哋咧，就我哋就會。

326
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:44,270
應該係幫助到我哋，或者我哋嘅同事咧，去去睇呢個噉嘅議案。可唔可以同我哋分享咧呢啲分析？Certainly, Madam Chair, we will provide an economic analysis for you based on what we have. Okay，不過都係估算啦，大家都明白係咪？啊，石禮謙議員。

327
00:59:44,550 --> 01:00:04,560
主席，誒，第一我申報咧，我唔係反對依個誒特別印花税。任何有嘅措施係要要令到炒炒風低嘅咧，係支應該支持。主席，但係我亦都支持咧，就唔可以眯埋眼盲目地去支持，唔係政府講乜。

328
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,270
都係得嘅。

329
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:21,630
我係做議員㗎啦，有個責任係維護整體嘅大市市民嘅利、個福祉同埋個利益喺度。你睇一睇咧，依個今日攞啲文件嚟睇一睇，依個N X A嗰度啦，一A。

330
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,470
喺二零一零年、二零一一年、二零一二年。

331
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:30,170
佢幾個嗰個二千零五二零一零年。

332
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,830
二零一一年一萬八個，二零一二年七千九九個。

333
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:49,960
加埋曬咧，二萬七千個係短期交易。如果係短期交易咧，大多數都應該要畀。如果S S D咧，就應該要畀畀畀税㗎嘛。但係嘿～

334
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,010
又唔知點解喎！忽然間，你睇一睇One B嗰度咧。

335
01:00:54,290 --> 01:01:12,740
二萬七千幾個一個短期買賣嘅咧，只係有一千八百三十六個需要畀印花特別印花税。佢講乜？即係即係呢度嘅個理據喺邊度咧？係完全都冇得解釋嘅，主席。

336
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:27,230
我有解釋之中，噉啊，當你一千八百個喺當上一趟我哋喺十月嗰陣誒二零一零年開會嗰陣時咧，好多議員都喺度嘅，主席話明咧，呢個印花税咧會谷起個樓市。

337
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,100
就會減低個供應。

338
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:50,650
個事實就係噉。頭先Mr Prescott答阿Kenneth個嗰個個，佢話佢好同意啊。嗰個利率係影響到，因為低利率係影響到人投資啊。二零零九年、二零一零年、二零一一年、二零一二年個利率咧都係低嘅，所以喺個咁喺咁多年個低利率嗰度咧。

339
01:01:50,650 --> 01:02:10,660
嗱，已經個利率冇關係，但係個高利率會嚟緊嘅，噉嘅影響好大。所以你唔好講個利率，我哋只係講個事實，用睇翻你啲數字。你啲數字，你淨係睇翻你嗰N X A嗰度咧，已經帶出好大好大個問題嚇。你睇啲物喺個依個依個嗰個數字咧。

340
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:27,350
真係你唔係要控制嗰個需求，你個嗰個嗰個demand，你淨係依個因為你控制咗demand咧，間接咧就影響到成個supply chain喺二十六。好啦，你再睇一睇咧，二零你話啊，因為佢哋而家我哋賣咗好多地噉。

341
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,380
由麪粉再麵包，由啲地啊去變嗰啲樓啊去賣出去。

342
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:42,100
都有個時間喺二零二零一一三年、二零一四年，你問下地產商會有幾多新樓會去，會賣到出嚟？

343
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,180
個供應唔係好大，噉你仲喺度減低依個供應咧，主席？

344
01:02:47,590 --> 01:03:00,810
個樓市咧一路咁谷上去，就算係冇成交啊，好似你睇到由九十五萬五，二零一零年、二零一一年同埋二零，由十五萬跌到九萬一，跌九萬九萬六跌到九萬一嗰度咧。

345
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:13,190
依個供應量一一有供應低咗咧，個樓價跟住升上去，依樣嘢係好事係好緊要。噉我哋仲要點去係鼓唔鼓勵個樓？

346
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:32,090
而家政府做咁多樣嘢，都係希望個樓市係穩定係喺喺度。但係而家樓市冇可能穩定，因為做咗個假假事出嚟。呢個假事咧影響到每一個買家。過去嗰嗰十嗰兩年買家嗰就係畀呢一個噉嘅政策咧影響到。

347
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:52,420
影響都好緊要，主席。三十五個percent喺嗰兩年嗰個樓市升值，因為個S S D個後，我唔話淨係賴曬S S D啊，主席。真係呢個，因為你供應係唔夠嘅。你供應，你就算供應入嚟，你都有時間。所以佢可唔可以解解釋？噉我聽講二萬七變到一萬八千三百六十。

348
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,120
六章嗰度係改解解釋畀我哋聽得唔得，主席？

349
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,490
好啊。

350
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:17,790
黃生係嘛？啊，張強，啊，any comment? Yeah, I actually agree with Mr. Shek on this occasion insofar as supply takes time, but I of course disagree insofar as an analysis of the effect of SSD on supply. The effect of SSD is to take the buyers out of the market. It doesn't affect the supply.

351
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:18,830
Richard。

352
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:36,300
主席啊，佢講，佢佢佢同我講呢樣嘢，佢佢講啱啊，因為係你冇你你你嗰個demand喺度，你個demand不嬲都係有咁大嘅，你supply多啲，你個價錢低啲，人咪買咯，個依個依個依個就係經濟學嘅理論啊嘛，主席。

353
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:48,080
依個唔係個官員啊，agree or disagree？我哋點係講事實啊，主席，可唔可以叫政府解解釋由二萬七變到一萬八千個情況係點？一千八啊，啊，黃生。

354
01:04:48,650 --> 01:05:02,700
係主席喺誒，即係附件一NSA裏邊有兩個表，Table One A同Table One B咧，係講緊兩樣唔同嘅嘢嘅。Table One A咧，純粹就係因為誒顯示翻喺三個時段二零一零年。

355
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,710
二零一一年、二零一二年裏邊。

356
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:11,670
喺利潤税署收到嘅買賣合約，拎嚟打印花税，我哋分析翻。

357
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,810
嗰個持有期係幾耐？

358
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:26,590
咁個附註第二點已經講到咧，呢啲噉嘅誒個案咧，有啲已經係因為係早於二零一零年十一月二十號之前買入嘅，咁到到去賣走。

359
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:47,050
可能就喺生效之後嘅，即係誒印花額外印花税條例生效之後嘅賣走噉，佢咪會計咗落依個噉嘅analysis裏邊咯。咁但係並不表示佢係要交額外印花税嘅。咁第二個表一B個表咧，就真正根據個法例係要交額外印花税，即係話。

360
01:05:47,050 --> 01:06:07,060
話佢買入時間係喺二零一零年十一月二十號之後買入，然後短於二十二個月之內係賣出嘅，咁呢個數目顯示就係一千八百三十六宗咁解。多謝主席，佢解釋得特登就係我想要解釋咁咧，就令到我可以再問個問題，你睇翻個N X B嗰度。

361
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:18,930
咧就睇到咧，所有佢頭先講嘅二零零九年嗰陣時咧，就係二二零零九年誒睇下睇翻二零零九年嗰個total agreement for sale係。

362
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:39,230
十一萬，十一萬，二零一零十四萬，但佢又有啲係十五萬，唔係即係當佢用依個。噉你睇翻嗰度喺嗰度嗰啲買嗰啲咧，就係嗰九千幾個喺個多個percentage都係好低嘅。主席廿幾萬九千幾個喺嗰度咧，就喺依度，因為咁咧就引致到好多供應喺個時間應該。

363
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:59,240
早嗰幾個月攞啲供應出嚟咧，因為啲人咧就因為呢個印發數咧就唔供應入嚟，所以冇供應入嚟啦，個需求啦個demand咧就係谷起曬啲價錢，噉啊嗰啲人咪畀你去到嗰陣時咪買咯，即係咁簡單個經濟學啊，主席啊，唔需要，即係你用翻幾個表嚟睇。

364
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,810
睇就睇到，所以我特登要去咁去解釋，然後我先去喺依度攞翻出嚟。主席，多謝你。

365
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:21,760
有冇回應？主席，我想解釋下係喺誒一A個表到二零一零年誒九零四一碌個數咧，如果睇翻個附註三咧，嗰度係淨係講緊二零一零年十二月一個月嘅買賣合約宗數嚟嘅，因為依個顯示翻就係。

366
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:33,600
有額外印花税之後個情況，咁表NHB個表，即係附註二附表二咧，由二零零五到二零一二年咧，嗰個係顯示到係全年。

367
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:43,160
譬如用翻一零年咧，就見到係誒右手邊數過嚟第三行咧，就係一五五七二三，就係全年嘅買物盒玉宗數。

368
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,550
咁九零四一喺附表一嗰個咧，就係淨係十二月嗰個數嚟嘅啫。

369
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,750
阿陶炳新議員。

370
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,870
誒，主席，我我誒將去問翻個附件一嗰度。

371
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:58,490
因為我好似講講下又唔係好明添。

372
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:07,380
嗱，你用二零一一年計啊嚇，嗱二零一一年咧就攞咗去誒，即係睇到咧九萬六千宗咧就係誒注章。

373
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:12,760
誒買賣啦，OK，好啦嗱，噉你跟住咧B嗰度咧就話有萬八宗咧。

374
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,790
就係轉售個案。

375
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,730
誒。

376
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:25,500
我我先用，譬如嗰個九六四九嗰度咧，九千六百四十九嗰度咧，即係第誒四誒第五行嗰度啦嚇。O.K.

377
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,980
我想問呢個九六四九。

378
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,060
係唔係？

379
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:34,430
喺呢個九六零三四裏邊嘅。

380
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,590
一定係係咪㗎？係咪噉啊？

381
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:57,880
係，我答咗個問題係係啱嘅。咁順便，我諗藉咗機會，我諗可能誒再解翻附表一同附表二有啲少少嘅誒數目字顯示到個數係有啲係夾翻出嚟嘅嗱。譬如我睇翻附表一表一A裏邊咧，左手邊第二個column A啦，譬如二零一二零九一二六四啦，即係我。

382
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:04,420
提到呢個係全年嘅印花税，要打印花税嘅買賣合約宗數啦。咁大家睇翻附表。

383
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,210
二啦。

384
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,980
附表二，睇翻二零。

385
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,490
一二年。

386
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,310
最大一行。

387
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,230
喺右手邊數過嚟，第三咧都係九一二六四嘅。

388
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:27,690
即係都係代表全年嘅買賣嘅宗數，OK，如此類推，係唔係？我我先問翻先，就附件一先，附件一，一A先，一A先。嗱，二零一一年住宅就係九六零三四。

389
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:40,170
誒第五行嗰度就係九六四九嗱，我先講九六四九咧，就係九六零三四裏邊嘅九六四九啦，嚇，即係一定係每一張都係嗰九六零三四裏邊啦。噉你所講十二個月。

390
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:48,250
到到廿四個月，就即係話呢個九六四九，例如佢係有一個誒賣出去啦，OK。

391
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:53,540
但係原來佢買入嚟咧，就喺兩個月誒，廿廿四個月之前買入。

392
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:57,960
就發現有九六四九係咪？O.K.嗱，因為你最尾咧。

393
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:18,250
你你嗰個話轉售個案佔總數咧，其實呢個佔呢個字咧係有少少誤導嘅。嗱，我唔係你話你特登誤導。乜嗱？我我意思係你一八零零六對比九六零三四，咁咪十八點七五咯。咁於是咪話哦，嗰年原來九六零三四咧，裏邊有十八點七五咧係轉賣嘅喎。

394
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:34,250
哦，咁其實就唔係嘅，因為我哋如果要睇翻，尤其是最大嗰個數，原來一八零零六裏邊嘅九六四九咧，其實成半咧係十二至廿四個月㗎嘛，咁所以咧必定要睇咧就係喺兩年前嗰個成交。

395
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:43,630
嘅宗數先至睇到咧，係幾幾多宗買入嚟，有幾多宗咧就喺廿四個月就賣翻出去啦。咁噉，如果你睇翻。

396
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:54,520
二零一一年之前嗰兩年，即係二零一零年嘅全年同二零零九年嘅全年咧，就應該係十四萬加十一萬，即係廿五六萬嘅裏邊。

397
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,130
即係嗰陣時買入啦。

398
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:02,300
然後咧就有大約一萬宗，即係九六四九咧，就係選選擇喺兩年內賣出。

399
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:22,820
咁先至係應應該九六四九佔之前嗰兩年會買入嗰個數咧，咁先至係一個合理嘅對比嚟㗎嘛？我唔知阿黃生明我講咩呵？係咪咁都比較有意義啲？就唔係就唔係九誒誒一八零零六佔九六零三四嘅幾多？噉樣係唔唔唔唔唔係嘅，因為佢買入嗰個。

400
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,330
時期唔係嗰年派入啊嘛。

401
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:44,710
係，我明誒，啊，黃生係，我明誒，陶議員所講嘅嘢，因為但係誒全年咧，因為有成十二個月咧，咁即係由一月開始計，都計到十月三十一號咧，其實都係一個數一路滾滾存嘅，咁其實就唔單單係兩年㗎啦，睇翻上去仲要四年㗎，係啊，啱，所以計起上嚟咧，所以所以佔嗰度，即係我我意思係我想講。

402
01:11:44,710 --> 01:12:04,720
最尾嗰個column咧，字幕嗰度咧，其實係冇乜冇乜人生意義，冇乜分析上嘅意義嘅。我冇話錯先啦，即係冇乜分析上嘅意義咯。因為因為你嗰個你你嗰個誒誒十二至廿四個月咧，你一定其實九六四九裏邊咧係當然一九六零三四裏邊啦，但係呢啲嘅買入嘅時期。

403
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:24,730
咧一定係喺之前嘅好耐之前買入嗱誒，最少都廿誒誒誒廿嗰廿廿四個月之前買入噉，即係係要十一萬加十四萬先至對比九六四九咧，先有意思咯，即係咁嗱。我我噉樣講咧，主席，我我得出一個我唔好話結論啦，我我我係想再去。

404
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:27,980
探討或者政府去諗一諗嘅問題咧，就係。

405
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:48,550
其實我哋香港咧有唔知話百幾萬個嗰啲咩誒住宅物業啊嘛，一百三嚇。O K.咁即係換句話講咧，我哋每年咧就有誒。如果一零年之前咧有十萬到啦嚇，十十萬十三四萬啦。O K.噉啊呢幾年咧就大約係九萬幾啦。咁其實即係話咧正常時期啊。

406
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:52,340
我用呢個正常呢兩個字嚇，廿四個月。

407
01:12:52,620 --> 01:13:00,800
我就會買咗入嚟，然後賣出去嘅咧，其實都佔一個百分比咧，係真係幾高下，即係高嘅時候可能十零個percent。

408
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:17,690
咁如果係真係成日都入嗱，噉你話究竟係香港係一個慘敗嘅社會啊，亦或係一個誒正常嘅活動咧？即係話正常唔係咁熱啊，即係你唔係話咁hot啦嚇，其實都係一兩成會也買咗入嚟，無論咩原因。

409
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:38,180
係好嘅原因、衰嘅原因、炒嘅原因，咩原因？即係你用道德嘅判斷咧，佢都係有成一兩成咧，就真係會賣出嘅。啊，即即係噉嘅喎。咁所以變咗嗰個係一個正常嘅嘅比例。而家我哋要睇咧就係口啦，喺呢個norm，我我用呢個角度，呢個norm係唔係特別喺呢幾年特別。

410
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,480
高咗咧，噉樣。

411
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,510
如果你用咗SSD，

412
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:47,690
當你去到十二至廿四個月，話唔係好零啦，即係五個percent，係咪特別？

413
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,120
啊！就佔個比例又多咗咧～

414
01:13:51,610 --> 01:14:11,620
咁如果我怎睇六個月嗰度，肯定就唔係多咗啦。六個即係正常，如果正常六個月會買賣嘅，同你有S S D之後咧，哇已經冇人咁做啦。六至十二個月亦都冇人咁做啦。係唯一十二至廿四個月咧，我哋就揾出大約嗰個number幾多，然後我哋做咗之後，其實佢嘅效果。

415
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:19,260
係咪到一個我哋都覺得係合理嘅程度，而係唔係要進一步加高咧？

416
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:39,150
就變咗我哋個對比咧，就唔係話一見到，咦？誒誒，哦，正常買賣都有一兩成嘅咁嗰個，即係香港係一個不正常社會，咁即係可能十幾廿年都係不正常啦。OK，噉你但嗰陣時冇冇用呢個税啦嚇。OK，咁變咗我就覺得咧，政府係咪應該用噉樣嘅perspective嚟睇咧，先至比較合理咧咁？

417
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,050
邊位回應咧？

418
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,000
啊！

419
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,450
我我諗。

420
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:51,630
I think Mr. To has more or less.

421
01:14:52,480 --> 01:15:12,490
分析的 situation， I'm not entirely sure I'm following it one hundred percent. But I think that's because the figures, as he's pointed out, are quite complex. Maybe what we need to do is to try and produce more more specific figures dealing with the periods that we're talking about. Because the figures, the tables that we're working off, obviously in response to members.

422
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,290
request.

423
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:17,250
But what we'll try and do is perhaps show.

424
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:21,000
What Mr. Tow has just described, can we do that?

425
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:40,290
我相信都有誒，相當困難嘅，因為係緊要買一單物業要揾翻佢屬於邊一個年度買入，要早翻一個出嚟，即係早翻去買入嚟啊！就係再再將個數集翻低，比較翻係當年嗰個印花税。

426
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:46,370
我哋譬如用翻，譬如正話提提到表二裏邊，附表二裏邊有一個數就係誒。

427
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:56,380
一零年十總數係十五萬五千七百二十三宗嗰個買賣合約啦，咁譬如可能係九六零三四裏邊有啲廿四個月嘅就會喺。

428
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:08,810
一五五七二三裏邊買入嚟嘅數，咁同樣九一二六四有啲就可能喺一五五七二三嘅，因為如果廿四個月就係噉樣啦嘛。九一九六零零三四就係有機會就十二個月就屬於一五五七二三嗰啲數，噉。

429
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:26,160
依個又都要好花功夫特別去做，因為我哋個電腦系統唔係有依樣噉嘅嘢嘅，可能要加埋人手要做，相當時間啊，同埋個準確性有幾大，我都唔敢誒，即係作出特別嘅啩。不過準確性唔係真係好準噉樣。嗯。

430
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:34,340
Okay，等緊。We'll we'll we'll work with them and try and come up with something. But obviously, it depends on practicality in that case. Yeah.

431
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,400
O.K.

432
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,590
阿胡志偉議員，多主席。

433
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:58,880
其實成單嘢咧，我諗頭先阿登強都同意咗咧。誒，假設我哋冇新嘅一個係延長特別印花税嘅安排嘅話咧，理論上咧，我哋嗰個嘅二手嘅可能出現嘅係供應咧係會增加翻嘅，或者我哋回復翻正常嗰個即係處境，因為。

434
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,080
佢已經完咗，佢個特別印花税啦。

435
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:03,000
咁誒？

436
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:18,780
再諗一諗，就係話咧，我哋而家仲有係買家印花税咧。可能我哋仲要再傾啦。咁但係大致上咧，買家印花税咧係針對就係話係啲非本地居民嗰個嘅係，即係喺香港置業嘅需要。

437
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:26,250
公司唔包含在內嘅時間，亦都係針對緊，即係好大程度，可能係我哋叫炒家啦噉樣樣。

438
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,760
噉我又會諗，即係你喺嗰個需求。

439
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:37,180
係可以減少咗，因為你有其他嘅税項咧，係處理緊。

440
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:57,470
你嗰個特別印花税個效應係收消失嘅時間咧，就應該喺市場上邊係增加翻一啲二手樓宇嘅供應，即係你會將過往種乾升嘅現象咧，係透過呢兩者嘅結合咧，其實係會令到個市場嗰個個煙，即係我哋嗰個。

441
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:17,480
嗰個嘅係即係個變化嘅能力咧，係大咗嘅。反而就係如果你只你啊再延長咗去嘅話咧，就會將誒而家我哋討論咗幾次就係話喺市場上邊正常嘅一啲二手樓可以供應喺市場上邊作為係買賣嘅數。

442
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,120
目咧係減少咗。

443
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:39,570
就會將呢個時間再進一步延長。咁換言之咧，其他嘅效力咧就仍然都係單邊嘅效力。我想講就話，我當然會覺得，即係用一個簡單嘅供求關係嘅話，一定係你同一時間能夠做一啲嘢，係可以減少咗我哋要針對嘅對象，譬如話係啲誒非本地居民嗰。

444
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:43,780
個需要，譬如話係炒家嘅係即係作動。

445
01:18:44,220 --> 01:19:04,230
同一時間喺個市場上邊，除咗我哋有新嘅係土地新增加嘅係樓宇供應之外，二手樓宇嘅供應嘅數量亦都可以喺個市場上面活化翻係係比較上多嘅時候咧，好明顯呢個喺經濟上嗰個諗法就係自然就會令到成個供求關係咧係會有個大啲。

446
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:11,930
嘅係煙殼大啲嘅一個係即係影響，我想睇下即係Duncan會唔會都同意呢一個噉嘅睇法同埋呢個分析。

447
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,130
等等先。

448
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,980
Let me try and.

449
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,000
react in this way.

450
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,310
There is, I think.

451
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:36,290
兩個不同issues，that we're talking about. One is the number of transactions in the market， and those are recorded in these figures. That's the number of times particular property is registered as a transaction.

452
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:40,490
the the other set of figures are the number of properties that are on the market.

453
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:47,160
and as you know, some properties can be on the market for a long time and not sell. Some properties are put on the market and sold very quickly.

454
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,240
what we're trying to do is to stop a situation where one property on the market.

455
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:58,870
is sold and then sold and then sold and then sold. So it's one property, but it's sold three times in a short space of time.

456
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:04,530
That's actually only one property on the market. Doesn't increase doesn't increase the size of the market.

457
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:11,190
and we think that special stamp duty has that effect because it stops these people selling quickly that single property.

458
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,350
doesn't increase the size of the market at all.

459
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:26,830
所以我 think that's where perhaps there is there is an issue. We need to be able to recognise that what we're talking about is the number of transactions in the market, as opposed to the supply of units in the market.

460
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:33,770
as far as the overall supply, I think.

461
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,480
作為我之前重複地説過，

462
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:44,510
the overall supply that's this hand isn't changed at all by the special stamp duty. the number of transactions is

463
01:20:44,790 --> 01:21:00,670
它 reduces the number of transactions because that one property isn't sold three times. I think that's a fairer analysis. Now, coming to the buyer's stamp duty, what we're doing there again is taking out of the market all of these people that are being coming in from overseas.

464
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:18,320
with money, because they are looking for somewhere to invest their money with a good return. And the property market in Hong Kong has been a good return. There's no doubt. I mean, the honourable member earlier indicated that it's been going up, whatever 35%. It's a huge return on investment.

465
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:38,710
所以，如果 property market shifts within say 35% in one year， and the additional cost that we're putting on is less than 35% or less than the amount that a person is prepared to take as their profit， then we're not going to have the effect。 hence we feel that to continue to

466
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:42,420
have that effect on special stamp duty, you have to increase the rates.

467
01:21:42,700 --> 01:22:02,710
And on buyer stamp duty, we want to add additional cost to those people who are coming in from overseas to take them out of the market. So that at the end of the day, the market really is intended to allow Hong Kong people to have the priority, and that that concept is still there. I'm not sure if I've answered your question, but.

468
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:08,870
我覺得嗱，主席唔好咁快説答不答，即係我覺得咧就係誒。

469
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:29,240
我哋喺個市場上邊個總嘅係實質嘅供應當然冇變啦，但係我哋一個願意去銷售或者我願意攞我單位出去做買賣呢一個嘅部分咧，其實都係構成我哋成個即係誒可能二手市場啦，或者我哋即係喺個市場上邊可以見到。

470
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:29,750
嘅。

471
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:50,050
可供買賣、可供銷售嘅供應嘅一部分，我想講係呢個部分嘅啫。即係我冇，我我我唔，我係同意就係話，我哋嘅實質總體嘅供應咧係冇變動，到直至到我哋有一日真係有多啲地起多啲樓，我哋先至堅嘅。咁但係問題就話，始終我哋唔可以否認就係透過呢啲唔同嘅誒。

472
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:57,790
對制啊！呢啲嘅係即係誒誒安排嘅時間咧，係影響咗喺嗰個市場上邊願意攞出嚟。

473
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:18,250
提供喺個市場上邊係去流轉作為買賣嘅一個誒嗰方面嘅供應，所以我諗我我我只係想講就話，如果呢一部分嘅供應係增回復翻正常嘅處境嘅話，配合翻我哋而家嘅買家印花税將呢一個係誒額外嘅海外嘅需求攞走咗，再配合。

474
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:38,260
埋即係嚟緊嘅係雙倍印花税呢個部分，亦都係會加重咗嗰個嘅係。如果你要炒賣嘅話，嗰個嘅係即係成本嘅時候，兩個反而呢一個特別印花税係唔使再延長嘅話咧，你就會令到市場上面咧好快進入翻就係願意拎。

475
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:42,600
出嚟去銷售嘅係單位咧，係會多翻。

476
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:50,780
剔走咗我哋嘅係買家嘅時間，咁正常嚟講，個市場個反應就應該個樓價向下落咁解啫。

477
01:23:51,310 --> 01:24:02,270
Madam Chairman, I I agree to the extent that if this were trying to tackle the supply side, but again I come back to the point that these measures are.

478
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:22,700
very definitely specifically targeting the demand side from those particular areas. the the the key to supply in the primary market is more land so that there can be more units built in the secondary market. I think it's a market that's more stable and that people can you know take a decision based on their actual

479
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:29,020
實際需要，as to whether they need to sell or whether they want to buy. I'm not sure that these measures

480
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:32,380
這些措施，SST和BSD有那 effect。

481
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:41,970
我唔 reluctant to comment on the changes to the ad valorem stamp duty, but I think I I would point out what the financial secretary has said.

482
01:24:42,550 --> 01:25:02,560
他係put in place measures that would increase the cost of all transactions across the board， except for those genuine buyers who need to use a property for themselves， the people who don't have any other property。 again， the concept is very specific。 we're targeting a different group here。 what we're saying is， look， in the current market， it really

483
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:13,700
is getting to the point where it's going to have some effect on the economy. Be careful, but if you really have a genuine need then and you fall within the categories that will be specified, this will not apply to you. So

484
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:20,190
In terms of the supply, I don't think it'll have that much effect. But obviously, that's a different discussion, Madam Chairman.

485
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,560
石禮謙言。

486
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:33,730
主席唔好再叫政府嘥咁多時間去做啲數字。英文有一句説説話講咧，statistics are lies, lies, lies。

487
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,770
啲話係大話嚟嘅啫，又唔係佢自己點講啊，主席。

488
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:58,240
咁咧，即係你只係我哋淨係睇一樣嘢咧，只係睇佢嗰個N X A嗰度咧，淨係睇佢嗰個S S D嗰個一B嗰度睇到咧，個成效係好叻㗎，係減低曬佢，已經已經夠啦依個。咁咧，因為睇完佢減低曬佢咧，噉我哋嘅嗰個。

489
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:14,900
落個藥咁重啱啊！你減定噉啊？你係咪繼續要繼續去減減咗？然後咧，邊個邊個負起依個依個咁成功嘅SSD嘅咧買家啦？嗰過去嗰兩年，二零一一年、二零一二年嗰十。

490
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:35,190
誒十八萬嘅買家就比貴咗嘅，比貴咗嘅誒誒價錢第一咁啦。噉啊，阿Mr. Prescott就話：，喂，有啲買完一一間樓買完一次買一次買一次，噉我就叫佢攞呢度咧，佢有啦，攞幾多喺嗰九萬六，喺嗰九萬一。

491
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:55,200
有幾多個買家係有做咗幾次去做出嚟？你唔好咁空口講大啊！講講白空口咁講講講唔係講大，空口咁講啲説話出嚟，你攞出嚟噉，你唔好咁講。好啦，主席，我啊再同你去睇一睇N X B啦。你睇一睇N X B，自從零零七年後啊。

492
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:59,450
個成格，我哋有幾多係供應喺個market嗰度咧？

493
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:12,380
就係你睇嗰個嗰個transaction嗰個transaction有幾多嘛？你你唔可以你有幾多market你唔知㗎嘛？但係你等佢睇個transaction就睇到啦個情況。喺二零零七年咧。

494
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:25,480
就新樓有一萬八個，二手樓有十二手樓咧，就係有十二萬。零八年一手樓九千個，二手樓十萬個。

495
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:37,330
二零零九年一手樓有萬五個，二手樓十一萬個。二零一零年萬二個新樓，二手樓十四萬三個。

496
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:50,170
二零一一年就係二零一年開始啦，嘅SSD喺度啦，即係我用依個睇啊，未必冚唪唥係關曬SSD。新樓仍然係保持咗喺一手樓，保持喺一萬個。

497
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:57,340
二手樓啦，跌到落去八萬五個。好啦，跟住咧，二零一二年啦。

498
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:12,430
二手樓、一手樓就萬二個，二手樓跌到七萬八個。你睇喺二手市場嗰度咧，就反映到咧個供應咧就係真係少咗啦。因為供應少咗，整體個成個市場。

499
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:32,720
個供供應需求咧係唔係係係係一你新樓啊就係咁多，所以咧啲地產商越買咪越貴咯，因為年年佢佢佢都係依啲噉嘅，佢係一萬一萬一萬，忽然間佢一萬兩年前佢賣八千蚊嘅，而家賣到元朗都賣到一萬一蚊啦，因為點解啊逼住個。

500
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:51,320
市價二手樓嘅市價唔夠啊嘛，供應唔夠啊嘛，就谷起二手樓，二手樓谷起啦，一手樓咪貴啲咯。呢個成個成個呢，你睇到呢啲數字出嚟咧，又影同埋咧，當時我哋有話翻畀佢聽，你睇翻個係handsal啦，嗰個S S D嗰陣時夠誒二零一零年十月嗰陣時啊。

501
01:28:51,600 --> 01:29:03,980
話明咧，依個SSE我哋要打擊炒樓嘅，但係付出個價，付出嘅代價咧就係樓價會升上，因為咧個供應會短。

502
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:24,440
啊！依啲數字喺度睇，咁頭先啊，Mr. Presco講佢，我唔同，我唔係唔同意佢講啊，但係要攞啲證據，有幾多間樓係炒個翻炒完又炒一餐，翻炒完又炒，噉你唔可以就咁講，你睇翻啲數字，我哋攞啲數字出嚟啊嘛，主席。即係所以而家你你話你而家再加到落去三十六個月。

503
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:34,380
月啦，好似頭先阿謝議員講，你係咪太重嗰度令到二手樓嗰啲人咧，仲更加唔去一手樓好緊要嘅，佢每一年佢起咗出嚟，佢就賣。

504
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:54,720
做生意啫嘛，佢噉啊越買越貴，梗係最好啦。但係啲二手樓嗰度咧供應唔夠咧，又影響到成個市場。好啦，你你睇睇成呢個N X P度講曬成個故事喺度，主席就唔好再去再要做得翻啦。一A嗰個咧真係都唔知講乜嘢嘅嗰度，琴日係錯嘅，真係。

505
01:29:54,720 --> 01:30:14,730
好奇怪，一個政府可以畀啲噉嘅figure出嚟咧。又是去睇下proportion of resale cases be over一嗰度咧，嗰個梗係錯啦。因為如果你淨係睇翻一去呢個be over一，一萬八千個over九萬六，又是佢咧喺喺嗰個resale cases嗰度咧，within twenty four months嗰度咧，佢又話有啲係以前。

506
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:28,030
前買㗎，咁一冚唪唥依啲依啲數字咧，主席一係唔好攞出嚟，攞出嚟咧係要公係要啱嘅，係正確嘅。噉我唔需要再去殺政府，再要用啲資源去，我哋唔想要去咁去資源去做，主席。所以咧。

507
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:35,470
依個就係要去解釋，佢頭先啊啊，Kenneth都問佢講有冇做一個sensitivity test。

508
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,720
有冇影響到點去做？

509
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,040
噉我亦都要個支持啊嘛，主席。

510
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:51,570
Duncan， couple of things. The figures that we produced Annex A 1A and 1B were in response to members' requests specifically.

511
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,730
We didn't dream the figures up. We were replying to members' requests. So, if any confusion, it's because of the request, not the way the figures are being presented.

512
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:20,020
Secondly, I did answer the honourable member to say that yes, we have done economic analysis, and I've also undertaken to try and provide those economic analyses to members. Third point is that unfortunately, Annex B really only shows the number of transactions. It doesn't show the supply in the market. I think.

513
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:33,810
honourable member would agree with me that there's always a difficulty in determining the number of supply in the market any any particular time or over time, so we we we look at the number of transactions, but within any transaction

514
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:54,140
table, you are going to have multiple transactions on individual units. That's just the way the market works. And I don't know if if if our revenue department captures that information, but if it does, we can of course produce it. Madam Madam Chair.

515
01:31:54,140 --> 01:32:14,150
Madam Chairman，啊，黃生，係，誒，回應兩點啊。第一點就係呢個表咧，就係誒現時冇顯示到有某一個物業可能係喺一段時間內被買賣幾次嘅。噉我哋都冇特別一個數目字去，咁但係有呢個可能性。咁另外就係講翻即係話誒呢個表附表一裏邊咧。

516
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:34,160
一個比例咧個百分比咧，因為係一個交易係一個買家同時有個買家先完成交易嘅，先至顯示佢單單交易，你咧打嚟印税，噉樣即係話有一個買一個賣，咁所以譬如用翻九一二六四二零一零二零一二年嘅數就有人買人買啦，咁同樣即係話喺九一二。

517
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:49,870
六四呢個買家裏邊，其中有七九二九呢個買家咧，就係屬於短期買賣嘅買家。咁如果用翻圖二元，即係話講早翻兩年之內或者一年之內嚟睇咧，因為佢買入嗰時，我哋冇可能知道呢個人會。

518
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:51,260
做物業。

519
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,400
會係十二個月之內買啊，廿四個月之內買，或者甚至唔買，咁所以好難做一個比較。而家係用翻。

520
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:05,560
九一二六四咁多宗，有咁多個買家，咁其中七九二九就係少過二十四個月之內。

521
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:12,320
賣走嘅，所以個比例就噉樣計出嚟。主席啊，如果你再用翻咧十二至廿四個月嗰度咧？

522
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:32,610
七千三百八二咧，你你你要你你呢啲咧牽涉到九萬六個，即係A嗰度九萬六九萬一嗰度有幾牽涉到嗰個total啊嘛？咁多十二個月喺嗰度，同埋廿四個月，你個B over A即係你我而家唔同你拗呢度啊！我冇咩意義啊！我我知道我自己講緊乜嘢。

523
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:52,620
我你話你啱嘅，噉你自己去你自己問你自己嘅良心就得㗎啦。你問得啱，你O K。但係呢個冇意義嘅，主席，我意義喺度咧，就係嗰千八個，你二萬七千個係短期買賣變咗係一千八個，嗰個短，因為呢一千八個你你覺得你好成功，你打低咗佢。頭先Mr. Press。

524
01:33:52,620 --> 01:34:12,630
講啊，一千八個，我哋唔知道嗰個供應幾多啊？咁個供應就喺你個嗰個整整體嗰個transaction，即係交易㗎嘛。你交易多咪你咪個價錢咪咪低啲咯。交易少誒，依個供應少咗咪咪價錢高，係低啲咯。供應多咗價錢低啲，供應少咗價錢高啲。

525
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:30,960
依兩年你就係咁去睇啊嘛！二零一一年、二零一二年啊嘛，我哋唔好講乜嘢，咁個價錢真係喺起到。如果唔係起到今時今日，個政府都唔需要做咁多落辣椒啦，係咪？你拗乜嘢？噉你係要話你成功，我都冇咪同你唔同，冇話你唔成功。

526
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:50,520
我話你好成功，但係個成功咧，個付出咧就係嗰十十八萬嘅個業而家新業主就畀你去畀你去呃咗，就係因為咧打擊兩個percent嗰啲炒家，就要九啊八個percent，九啊八個percent啲業主我嚟賣起個賣畀貴單咁啫嘛，主席。

527
01:34:50,930 --> 01:35:10,940
好，呢個你嘅誒意見，呢個唔係意見，呢個係我個事實，主席，我講個事實出嚟睇到個價錢。你用翻個市，用翻依兩年嘅價，嗰個價起價同埋依兩年嗰個嗰個買賣。死完，你頭先講咗一係列嘅數據，你可唔可以畀我哋都作個參考？即係過去一幾年裏邊一手同二手市場嘅供應。

528
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:18,230
冚埋喺曬，我冇我自己冚埋喺曬B嗰度啊，主席，喺曬B嗰度我讀出嚟㗎，NXB嗰度啊。

529
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:38,520
係係依，我冚唪唥我唔敢用我自己啲數字，我冚唪唥用翻曬政府嘅數字。你淨係睇睇N X B嗰度啊，誒誒primary market、secondary market、overall嗰度咧，然後睇到啊，二零零五至零一二年咧，你睇到咧，香港個總體嗰個個買賣冚唪。

530
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,580
講喺曬total agreement of。

531
01:35:40,880 --> 01:36:00,890
Total number of agreement for sale由你而家我最黑暗嘅日子咧係二零零五年至到二零一二年咧，你記住，記得二零零六年咧係金融風暴嘅問題喺度咧，先去到九六，去到九萬六。但係我哋因為個S S D咁成功啊，二零一一年二零一。

532
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:20,900
二年啊，主席，就係跌到九萬六一六九萬一。你睇一睇今年嘅數字有幾多咧？我哋都都唔知，所以所以即係就係呢個將來會睇到啊。但係我只係話畀你聽，有個呢個有個喺個市場嘅影響，佢哋唔可以唔接受呢個事實嚟嘅，主席。No, any comment? Yes, Madam Chair, I'm sorry, it cannot.

533
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:40,910
不可能，be shown from these figures that the impact on the market of SSD has been so dramatic as to reduce the numbers. the the reduction in the number of transactions must relate to the price, and the price has been driven up as we explained many times by exceptionally low interest rates, by the influx of money from overseas, by

534
01:36:40,910 --> 01:37:00,920
缺乏供應在市場，在主要市場，驅動上價位在次級市場。那些是為什麼價位上漲的原因。絕對，我不能接受這是因為。主席，利率已經穩定。主席，利率。市場也已經非常穩定。如果沒有，如果沒有。

535
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:20,930
not be the SSD. I'm not against the SSD, but I'm just telling the truth, Madam President, and also that he cannot just just be selectively and blame it on the the exchange, the the interest rates as such that the the the the informationers are all.

536
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:40,940
already in the N X B，Madam President。唔係，石議員，你嗰個意見好清楚，你就將供應咧就演譯成為嗰個買賣合約嘅數字啊嘛。阿登勤就唔同意呢個就係個供應啊嘛。大家個演譯係不同個供應主席啊，佢話價錢價錢平價錢貴啲人唔買，點解？

537
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:47,310
價錢貴啊，因為供應少咗，即係咁簡單嘅economic。你你係讀經濟嘅誒主席？

538
01:37:47,590 --> 01:38:07,600
一個經濟一個好簡單嘅supply and demand，form four form four讀economics都有㗎啦，主席。依個係冇得變轉㗎。你個價錢高嘅唔係因為你供應大嘅價錢高，嗰個叫inelastic。依個唔係inelastic，係唔係依個？依個係一個mass market有喺曬度嘅主席。你唔好諗，我哋都明白你嘅。

539
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:27,610
你嘅你嘅意見㗎啦，因為我唔係意見啊，主席，我唔中意政府喺度亂咁講嘢，主席。嗯，你要跟隨主席講咩？I'm sorry, when when interest rates are what one percent below prime, and prime is about what two percent, compared to the long-term averages of six to ten percent, that's a huge difference. That's that's the

540
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:47,620
biggest impact on the ability of people to buy is the fact that it doesn't cost them very much to raise the money. That's the most important thing. The second thing is there is a huge amount of money flooded in. We know this. It's come in from overseas. You have to deal with that problem. The third thing is, yes, I agree with you. Supply has been constrained for a number of years now.

541
01:38:47,620 --> 01:39:07,630
And that is definitely one of the factors, but it's three different factors, not the minor impact of SSD. I think that's where we differ. I don't disagree with you, but I'm just using the SSD with everything at a at a standstill. The QE one, QE two, QE three came over a number.

542
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:08,580
years.

543
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:28,870
哈！It just come out suddenly. And secondly, if you talking about the interest rate is such an evil, why why didn't our FS to this morning on the radio defend the link? The link is part of the of the whole whole interest rate. I mean, if you want to discuss with economics review, I'm very happy to do it, but not on this.

544
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:34,580
O.K. 好，多謝你啊，石議員。噉我哋誒畀一謝偉權議員。

545
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:54,930
多謝呢個問題嚇。就其實當然咧，嗰個非常時期咧，用非常嘅政策咧，我係支持。其實呢個用管理嗰個需求咧，喺目前嚟講咧，即係我其實咧都贊同嘅。只不過我都都希望咧，即係政府咧喺誒用任何措施方面咧，即係誒。

546
01:39:54,930 --> 01:40:06,970
除咗分析同埋研究之外咧，亦都係要即係加以留意個市場個變化。誒，希望咧，即係佢哋可以即係達到佢嘅目標啦，噉樣。

547
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:13,460
咁其實咧，我我唔知可唔可以咧，即係請或者誒阿鄧勤咧，就喺。

548
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:20,840
附件一一A嗰度咧，其實佢將嗰啲數字咧，或者可唔可以再加少少咧？就話。

549
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:29,670
嗰啲買賣嗰啲誒成交嗰種誒裏邊咧誒，另外有啲數字就係有幾多單咧，其實係咧。

550
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:44,110
誒應該要畀呢個額外印花税嘅，即係可唔可以咧？因為尤其是我都想知道下二零一二年咧，誒買賣嗰度咧十二，尤其十二個月至二十四個月嗰七千幾宗。

551
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,760
嗰度可能其中咧有好多咧，其實係唔受嗰個。

552
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:54,600
即係誒誒買埋印花税嗰個限制嘅，咁可唔可以提供到啊？呢啲數字唔該，主席。

553
01:40:55,060 --> 01:41:00,190
係，阿黃先生係，可以稍個補充個資料。好啊，唔該。

554
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,500
好，誒有冇其他議員想提問？

555
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:24,400
嗱，我諗誒，我哋誒今日討論特別印花税就去到呢度啦。噉我相信咧，議員同埋官員個分歧咧，尤其是誒石議員你嗰個誒觀察咧，我諗比較難達成一致嘅結論嘅。我明白你嘅意思誒。

556
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:29,800
特別印花税咧，係我諗某個程度一定抑壓咗個誒供應嘅，但係。

557
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:50,090
是否完全係因為噉樣而導致到個價錢上升咧？呢個係大家嘅演繹係不同嘅。其實大家都好明白呢個係一個判斷。我判斷你唔好誒誒，我判斷我冇話到其他唔係一個問題。我只係攞印花税做影響到個其他，因為嗰其他嗰嗰嗰啲條件咧都係喺度㗎啦。

558
01:41:50,090 --> 01:42:10,100
因為你加咗印花税出嚟咧，影響到個嗰個交易咧係真係少咗喺度。咁個理由，主席，我係冇要佢哋同意，我只係喺度咧喺個hands嗰度，好似我上一趟嗰個誒特特別印花税，我講咗出嚟咧，我喺嗰陣時講就嗰個嗰個嗰個供應會低，嗰個市價會。

559
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:30,110
高就會益會得到我啲選民嘅，即係啲地產商嘅利益就係噉。但係我都唔想見到個市道一路咁狂升三啊幾個percent，喺兩年升三啊幾個percent。地產商都唔想見噉嘅，主席。我知為咗想我哋平穩市場，但係咧好人做壞事，我唔係話政府官員壞人啊，我話佢好人做。

560
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:50,120
還是係唔識嘢嘅事咧，就去以為佢自己識嘢咧，影響到唔係政府官員，唔係立法會議員啊，影響到冚唪唥所有十二一百三廿萬嘅業主同埋咧啲準業主啊，主席，我只係我冇要要求佢哋同意我嗰啲嘢，我我講出嘢唔希唔希望人哋。清楚明白，你你呢個觀。

561
01:42:50,120 --> 01:43:10,130
點都係表述咗好多次嘅，大家都係關心，唔希望影響嗰個準。明白，我要去了理解我，我唔需要政府要支同我支持嘅主席。明白，我只係講我需要講嘅嘢啦嚇。好嗱，噉樣我希望當局咧都回應翻今次議員今次具體嘅提問啦。我特別係誒阿石議員同埋謝議員都提過嘅。

562
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:30,140
其實事實上，你呢個安排咧，係令到嗰個正常嘅商業行為，特別係重建啊，以致到謝議員都有啲具體嘅提問啦，係嘛？你嗰封信誒翻新啊等等咧，嗰個成本係高咗好多。當局你哋下次去回應誒問題嘅時候，都要一評去回應，因為當日個。

563
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:30,840
嗰個。

564
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,420
啊！

565
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:38,410
團體代表都有提到呢一點啦，係嘛？噉你哋希望你哋重新考慮啦。咁至於，

566
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:58,700
誒，睇下點樣可以幫一幫嗰個重建，唔讓到佢個成本係影響咁大。因為事實上重建係可以增加個供應。咁如果你打擊咗個重建咧，噉你其實變相又減低個供應，係咪？係咪啊，石議員？主席啊，依張文文件我哋未講完㗎，係嘛？因為B S C都未講啊，主席。冇錯，所以我我就話我希望佢答。

567
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:00,500
下一次可以講B.S.D嘅。

568
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:20,880
係咪？因為都希望可以講講B S D，因為誒議員嘅意見其實都好清楚表述㗎啦。咁對於是否應該再提升嗰個特別印花税咧，我諗大家對個數字現亦都有不同嘅。噉我哋誒下一次不如再講講個B S D，然後等政府當局又回應一下團體嘅誒誒疑問，亦。

569
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:27,580
都其實好多部分都係議員都有提問嘅，好冇？好，好啊！噉我哋今日嘅會議就去到呢度啦。

570
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,930
噉啊！多謝大家，唔該曬。
