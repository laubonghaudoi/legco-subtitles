1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
嚇，田北辰嘅，我哋而家開始開會。

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,650
請阿梁國權先生同埋嘅陪同人士入會議室，唔該。

3
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,300
寫咗兩。

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,950
報議員，你係咪要發問嘅？

5
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,830
係。

6
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:27,150
首先就歡迎各位出席調查港深港高速鐵路香港段建造工程二五嘅背景及原委。

7
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,880
專責委員會嘅第八次公開言訊。

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:45,090
今日向專責委員會作證嘅係證人係香港鐵路有限公司行政總裁梁國權先生，梁生啊，再次多謝你再次嚟出席我哋呢個會議啊，就係協助我哋工作。

9
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:57,200
噉嘅專責委員會已經同意梁生嘅要求啦，可以有陪同人士出席言訊嘅。梁生嘅陪同人士咧，係金道律師事務所合夥人。

10
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,430
港鐵。

11
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,040
公司外聘法律顧問炳純先生，Mr. David Bateson。

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,160
噉就仲有就係港鐵公司首席法律顧問包偉明先生。

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:20,330
港鐵公司首席公司事務顧問黃美琪女士，同埋港鐵公司協調經理高速鐵路吳家華先生。

14
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:30,770
我哋想誒陪同人士注意就係上述誒，佢哋呢班陪同學生出席嘅人士咧，係唔可以向專責委員會發言。

15
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,090
本人提醒誒各位證人咧，就係本。

16
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:47,800
專責委員會係冇獲立法會授權行使《立法會權力及特權條例》第三百八十二章第九括弧一條嘅權力。

17
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,440
因此，證人係唔受第三百八十二章賦予證人嘅特權所保障。

18
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,770
喺詢問過程裏邊，根據第三百八十二章第十八條嘅規定。

19
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:16,230
對專責委員會提出嘅言訊主題上具關鍵性嘅問題，蓄意給予虛假嘅回答，或者向專責委員會提交虛假、失實、捏造或捏改嘅文件，而意圖欺騙專責委員會，即屬犯罪。

20
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,460
係，我相信證人會真誠咁協助委員會嘅工作。

21
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:37,060
專責委員會已經制定咗本身嘅工作方式同程序，本席請大家留意以下幾點。首先，第三百八十二章所定嘅議員特權，只係適用於言訊嘅過程。

22
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:48,440
所有議員，包括非專責委員會委員嘅議員，都應該避免喺言訊過程以外場合發表與言訊有關嘅意見。

23
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,070
另外，我想借呢個機會提醒旁聽。

24
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:12,360
誒今日言訊嘅公眾人士係唔受呢個誒同埋傳媒咧喺言訊過程以外場合披露言訊裏邊提供嘅證據咧係唔受第八十二章所保護。而所以，如果有需要嘅話，各位人士同埋傳媒朋友咧，應該就佢哋嘅法律責任咧。

25
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,810
徵詢法律意見。

26
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:23,510
喺守候嘅過程裏邊，本席會要求證人就佢曾經向專責委員會提交嘅文件作出確認。

27
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,800
啊！將文件納入為呢個專責委員會嘅證據。

28
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:37,980
另外，專責委員會已經決定，所有經專責委員會考慮並同意可以公開嘅文件，會上載喺立法會網頁供公眾查閲。

29
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,780
而家夠鐘，亦都係有足夠嘅發電人數，我宣佈言訊正式開始。

30
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,160
阿梁國權先生。

31
00:04:46,440 --> 00:05:03,590
廣鐵公司曾於二零一五年八月十四日向專責委員會秘書提供一份文件，即係專責委員會文件第MTR四號。你而家係咪正式向專責委員會出示該份文件為證據？係。

32
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,180
梁生喺呢個。

33
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:17,650
誒，我聽秘書講，你係要求喺言開始之前誒，著會有一個開場嘅發言，係咪啊？係係噉啊！請你開始啦。唔該，多謝主席。

34
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:25,840
主席，各位委員，上次向各位交代之後啊，知道委員仲有事情想了解。

35
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:34,850
我會盡力回答大家嘅提問，不過唔好意思，大家都知道我中文唔係咁好。

36
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:43,770
為咗可以準確表達我嘅意思啊，好似上次一樣，我繼續用英文回答。

37
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,210
誒，梁生，呢個係你嘅權利。咁其實你中文都講得好好嘅。

38
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:10,850
多謝主席。噉我想問一問，就係你而家係咪係？但係你唔介意我係用翻中文，因為呢個係一向我都用開中文。唔介意，主席。阿主席，我啊啊，仲有少少英文，可唔可以講一講？啊，當然可以。啊，Honourable Chairman and Committee Members，thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide

39
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,360
information to the select committee on the express rail link project.

40
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,840
我會 start off with an update on progress of the project.

41
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:30,700
subsequent to the select committee hearing on 15th of July, we have provided supplementary information requested by the select committee to the best of our ability.

42
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:43,590
to address members' concerns, the supplementary information covers a wide range of issues, including project management and monitoring, as well as details of the delay recovery measures.

43
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:57,730
With the continuous efforts of our projects team, I am pleased to report to members that as of today, the overall completion progress of the Express Rail Link project is 74%.

44
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:18,050
We have made significant progress in a number of key areas. The 25 kilometre twin track underground tunnels are over 99% bored through, with only approximately 100 metres left to go. It is expected that full tunnel breakthrough.

45
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,080
會被達成，before the end of the year.

46
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:34,230
The structural works for all 14 buildings in Sackgon Stabling Siding and Emergency Rescue Siding have been completed, and the architectural builders' works are progressing steadily.

47
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:52,690
progress has also been made at the West Kowloon terminus by adopting blasting in parallel with mechanical methods. The overall excavation of the terminus is 95% complete, while 63% of the concrete structure has been cast.

48
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,780
The pace of steelwork fabrication and erection has also been improving.

49
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:14,500
for the rooftop structures, fabrication of all temporary steel has been completed, while fabrication of the permanent steel is 61% complete. The on-site erection of both is now well underway.

50
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:23,850
The electrical and mechanical, or E and M works, are also making good progress, with overall completion at 50%.

51
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:44,150
About 75% of the track areas are available for overhead line installation and track laying, with half the tracks now laid. At West Caledonian Terminus, E and M contractors now have access to about 95,000 square metres of workspace and building services.

52
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,290
installation has commenced in the platform areas on level B4.

53
00:08:49,740 --> 00:09:04,790
As you are aware, the Express Rail Link is a large, complex and challenging project. It is the world's first all-underground high-speed railway project, which includes a fully underground terminus in the heart of the city at West Kowloon.

54
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:26,040
The West Kowloon terminus site occupies 11 hectares of reclaimed land. It is bounded by Kowloon Station to the west, Austin Station to the east, and the West Kowloon Cultural District to the south. The terminus is the largest de-excavation undertaking ever carried out in Hong Kong. The

55
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,490
presence of operating railway lines, high-rise buildings and busy main roads nearby adds to the complexity of the engineering challenges.

56
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:49,690
The project also involves 25 kilometres of twin-track underground tunnels connecting West Kowloon terminus with the boundary between Hong Kong and San Juan. The degree of engineering difficulty is significant.

57
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:10,010
as previously reported, the key causes of the delay in the construction of the express rail link include tunnel boring machine issues, the fast tracked front end of the project and late site possessions. Furthermore, unfavourable ground conditions such as higher than expected rock head levels, weak seams and the

58
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,860
presence of cobbles and boulders have also been a significant cause of delay.

59
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:30,020
at the same time, overall labour shortage of about 20% has significantly impacted the five railway projects which were being constructed concurrently, including the Express Rail Link.

60
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,990
自 commencement of construction, work sites have experienced difficulties in filling vacancies across all skill sets.

61
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:49,990
As mentioned in the second report by the independent board committee, a shortage of workers and supervisors has posed significant challenges to the construction programme of the express rail link.

62
00:10:50,280 --> 00:11:10,290
Despite these challenges, we have taken our role and responsibility as the project manager very seriously. The corporation has all along acted in accordance with the entrustment agreements, which require us to oversee the design, construction and commissioning of the project. To this end, we have used our best endeavours to bring the project forward.

63
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:20,210
and at the same time provide regular updates and progress reports to the government, as well as to the Legislative Subcommittee on Matters Relating to Railways.

64
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:40,570
While there are still challenges in the remaining construction works, as the project manager, we continue to use our best endeavours to deliver the project according to the revised timetable. We have submitted the latest estimate of the cost to complete and programme to complete to government at the end of June. Government has since requested a.

65
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,110
Additional information, which we have provided accordingly.

66
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:53,970
please be assured that the corporation and government share the same objective of delivering the project as quickly as possible in the most cost-effective manner.

67
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:14,420
although the project may not have progressed as originally planned, more than 7,000 women and men are working hard day and night to push it forward. The MTR Corporation remains fully focused on the important task of delivering a world-class high-speed rail to support Hong Kong's continued development.

68
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:23,410
主席，多謝梁生。而家係咪正式？

69
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,340
向專責委員會出示你嘅開場發言稿作為證據。Yes, chairman.

70
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:44,610
我提醒各位委員，根據專責委員會工作方式同程序第十五段喺公開言訊裏邊，委員只係為確立同專責委員會嘅調查相關並屬於調查範圍內嘅事實。

71
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,840
議題問。

72
00:12:46,310 --> 00:13:04,210
委員唔應該喺個言訊裏邊發表意見，或者係作出陳述。我會根據工作方式同埋程序第十六E段，決定某啲問題同埋某項證據係咪同專責委員會嘅職權範圍所在嘅調查相關，並屬於調查範圍內。

73
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:11,220
而根據工作方式同程序第十六F段咧，就委員係可以簡短咁作呢個跟進嘅問題。

74
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,170
同埋圍繞原來問題追問更詳細嘅答案。

75
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,720
或者係要求澄清所給予嘅答案。

76
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:28,560
而我作為主席，有酌情權決定某條問題係咪屬於跟進問題，以及應否容許委員提問。

77
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
該問題。

78
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,910
另外。

79
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,650
每位委員嘅提問時限係十分鐘，包括證人回應。

80
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,210
委員係可以選擇向一位或出兩位證人提問，但係。

81
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,650
就係好明顯，我哋只係得一位證人啊出席今次嘅言訊啦。

82
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:56,020
咁而家言訊咧就正式開始，誒為咗善用呢個言訊嘅時間咧，請委員嘅提問咧係盡量精簡同埋具體。

83
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:06,060
啊，同埋證人咧應該係明確同埋係到題嘅一個啊切實嘅回應嚇，好嘛？就唔好大家唔好浪費時間。

84
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,590
咁而家開始提問，連問連答十分鐘。

85
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,420
盧偉國議員。

86
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,440
誒，多謝主席。

87
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:27,290
誒主席，我誒有好幾個問題嘅，噉我第一個問題咧，我就想係就誒高鐵香港段工程嘅早期嘅估算嘅費用。

88
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,740
作出提問。

89
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,200
主席，我就想誒，透過你問阿梁生咧，就係。

90
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,980
根據廣深港高速鐵路香港段嘅獨立專家小組報告。

91
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:52,820
誒裡面嘅資料提及咧，就話港鐵公司喺二零零九年四月八號就高鐵香港段工程項目嘅委託費用嘅估算咧。

92
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,510
係九百五十億元。

93
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:11,820
但係咧，就喺二零一零年一月十六號咧，就呢個工程嘅項目嘅委託費用估算咧，係修定為六百五十億元㗎。咁呢個差距都相當大。

94
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:32,220
嗯，所以主席，我就就想嗯睇下咧，係誒係咪可以喺今日嘅會議上咧，誒梁生能夠解釋一下咧，就點解會喺都比較短嘅時間嚇，二零零九年四月八號去到二零一年一月十六號呢段期間咧就。

95
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,480
嗰個估算會有咁大幅度嘅減少啊，減少三百億元。

96
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:58,920
噉就誒，是否因為呢個第二份嘅委託協議書咧，就裏邊關於嗰個風險嘅釐定嘅問題，誒，港鐵公司係夠膽即係喺個股算上咧，能夠咁進取嚇一個誒咁咁嚇畀。

97
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:14,310
誒第一次嘅估算咧有咁大嘅差距，抑或係有其他嘅原因咧？係我想答咗呢個問題先。係我想問一問誒羅偉國議員，就係你講嗰個誒估算嗰個做工程造價同嗰個誒？

98
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:34,950
風險評，個評估風險評估，係個疑問係有啲誒係有關係嘅。嗱呢個我想，嗱我想問咧，當然誒阿梁生佢可以即係就佢誒自己嘅所知咧，就即係解釋嗰個差距。不過我其中一個誒，我我想即係睇嘅方向咧，呢。

99
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:54,960
個其實噉樣去定定咧，會唔會係好進取？呢個進取力都同呢個項目嗰個誒誒，大家合作個方式咧，個風險承擔方面有個關係。係啊，因為呢個咧其實誒啊，或者我不如我問問埋第個問題，就關風險嘅問題。係就係話誒，梁生作為。

100
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:11,360
呢個港鐵公司嘅前財務總監咧，其實有冇分析過港鐵公司咧喺而家呢個誒高鐵香港電嘅項目，以呢個服務經營權模式誒建造嘅，就誒由港鐵。

101
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:31,650
公司嘅管理、鐵路嘅建造，政府支付建造嘅管理費用咧，呢一方面咧，嗰個即係嗰個誒風險嘅狀況咧，誒呢個新嘅法嘅合作啦啊嘅模式咧，嗰個風險方面咧，其實佢當時有冇咩估估算咧？係梁生，或者嘗試作答啦。啊啊！

102
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,810
多謝 honourable member for that question.

103
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:55,100
Firstly, on the cost estimate, as members are aware, there were many experts involved at the initial stages in two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine and two thousand and ten in advising on different aspects of cost. Experts that were appointed by government and ourselves. The migration of the cost.

104
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:15,110
Estimates are well highlighted in the IEP report. In fact, it's on page sixty one of their report. As the honourable member mentioned back in April of two thousand and nine, there was a very initial estimate that was close to ninety five billion Hong Kong dollars. However, as well also highlighted.

105
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:35,120
在IEP報告，從4月到9月2009，有減少項目範圍，因為各位都知道，減少項目範圍也會帶來成本減少，成本預估。這些減少項目範圍，這點在第62頁政府報告中已經強調過。

106
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:55,130
Its IEP report includes a reduction in the number of tunnel boring machines from six to nine. It includes the deletion of platform screen doors. It includes a change of the vent building to an emergency access point. These reductions in scope allow for a.

107
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:15,140
減少那成本預測down to 73.9 billion dollars， as highlighted in the IEP report. At the same time， government have their own independent assessment of costs. They had their Jacobs， as I understand， being their adviser on the。

108
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,530
their visor on the cost to complete.

109
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:38,820
What I would further like to highlight, and this is well highlighted in the IEP report as well, is that subsequent to the tendering of all contracts, subsequent to the tendering of all contracts, in fact the contracts came in at a much lower amount than the.

110
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:51,790
Original estimate. So as highlighted on paragraph 331, indeed the of the 49 contracts that were investigated and reviewed by the IEP, those 49 contracts.

111
00:19:52,070 --> 00:20:03,550
came in at an amount of 13.7 billion below the original estimates that were done back in 2009 and early 2010. Thank you, Chairman.

112
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:24,480
我哋過二誒主席就誒，似乎梁生就喺個答案中咧，就誒似乎亦都冇提到，因為個風險嗰個承擔方面咧有乜嘢嘅唔同咧，所以使到嗰個誒股選咧係咁進取。噉啊，梁生亦都講咗咧，就係話誒實際。

113
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:44,490
常翻嚟嘅投標個價錢咧，亦都都都真係切合佢哋嘅，即係調整咗，即係較低咗嘅嘅估算啦。不過咧，都減少咗工程範圍。另外一方面咧，就係話嗰個內容方面都有所唔同。誒，我進一步想提問咧，就係如果睇翻，假如嗰陣時個估算咧。

114
00:20:44,490 --> 00:21:04,500
係因為個內容方面都有所調整，所以個比較客觀嘅估算。而實際上投標翻嚟個價錢咧，似乎誒梁生嘅誒頭先嘅顯示咧，即係話似乎啲印證咗嗰個估算唔係話即係有有咩好大嘅落差嘅。但係到今天就嗰個誒真係超支。

115
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:24,510
情況亦都咁嚴重咧，係是否即係顯示到咧？就喺嗰個誒項目管理嗰方面咧，特別嗰個成本方面咧，係即係出咗乜嘢嘅問題，引致到到今天我哋又睇到咁大嘅嘅升幅咧噉。盧偉國議員誒，我相信。

116
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:44,520
係今日個超支嘅問題咧，就唔係我哋嗰個委員會誒要調查嘅範圍之內。如果你係講個超支係因為由於由於嗰個舊年四月嗰個而而產生嗰啲超支咧，就你可以作出提問。但係之後嗰啲關於累積嗰啲噉嘅。

117
00:21:44,520 --> 00:22:04,530
超支到今日為止咧，我哋係唔屬於我哋嘅調查範疇嚇。噉啊，不如我用誒另一個方式問咧，就係具體一啲啦。喺誒目前香港段嘅四十幾份嘅合約裏邊咧，就嗰個有幾多係未能夠如期開工嚇？一講如期開工。

118
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:18,980
咁如果未能夠如期開工咧，就可能就係話嗰個完工日期咧，亦都需要即係相應係有所調整。咁呢個亦都會唔會成為即係多份合約嘅滯後嘅原因咧？咁？

119
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,540
梁生。

120
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,900
啊。

121
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:44,430
Honourable member, thank you for that question. Firstly, as members are aware, the Express Rail Link is a very large and very complex project, as we have highlighted before. Difficulties encountered during construction would be inevitable for a project of this nature. And of course, when the project team comes across

122
00:22:44,430 --> 00:23:04,440
這些困難，他們盡力克服延誤。有許多接口在列車連接中，有些接口在IEP和IPC報告中被強調。這些接口可能導致某些合同被。

123
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:19,040
perhaps slightly later tendered out than originally estimated, but the team, as always in the professional manner, would use their utmost to catch up the original schedule by using delay recovery measures and other measures.

124
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:30,360
主席，我想誒進一步誒問咧，就係誒亦都到即係牽涉到嗰個鹽嘅問題啦，嗯。

125
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,810
我相信都要睇咧，就係話嗰個風險管理嗰方面咧，即是否做得足夠。

126
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:57,100
咁喺呢度咧，亦都誒往往都係有兩種嘅風險管理嘅模式啦。一個所謂定升嘅風險嘅管理嘅模式，一個咧就係定量嘅風險管理嘅模式。咁喺呢一方面咧，就誒根據港鐵公司提供嘅文件都。

127
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:17,110
係話咧，係港鐵公司過往係採用定性嘅模式，包括誒香港誒呢個誒高鐵香港段嘅都係用呢個誒定性模式進行施工嘅管理，就係嗰個風險管理嘅。咁喺呢度咧，會唔會啊，梁生會唔會再檢視翻咧？其實喺定

128
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:32,620
定性同埋定量嘅風險模式管理之間咧，呢個選擇即是否合當咧？如果睇翻轉頭咧，會唔會用一啲定量嘅方式咧，又會對於嗰個風險方面、對呢個業務方面嘅管理咧，會有所幫助咧？

129
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:53,250
No, thank you, honourable member for that question. The honourable member is absolutely correct to say that generally there are two ways of assessing risk. One is a qualitative, and the other is a quantitative. In terms of looking at schedule risk, timetable risk, MTR has historically used

130
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:13,260
質的質的approach。This approach is in line with our project management systems. Now, this project management system is a system that was reviewed by a number of experts back in two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine. And in fact, those experts, both employed by government and M.

131
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:33,270
ECR have noted the robustness and the good control and the excellence of those of the project management system, which uses a qualitative a qualitative assessment for programme. I would also add, as highlighted in my written response to.

132
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:53,280
Similar question from the last select committee meeting. That from a cost to complete perspective, we do use a quantitative approach. So we have historically used a qualitative approach in line with our project management systems for schedule for timetable and a quantitative.

133
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,810
approach for costs.

134
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:08,100
都係個人係誒，對於呢個項目嘅管理咧，另一方面咧係相當重要咧，就係話喺個高層嘅工程管理方面嗰個人力。

135
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:28,390
嘅是否足夠嘅問題，咁因為同一時間咧，除咗高鐵嘅香港段咧，都有喺好幾個咧大型嘅鐵路項目進行之緊緊嘅，咁喺誒港鐵公司咧，係負責呢五個興建中嘅鐵路項目咧，就係一個嘅工程總監。

136
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,860
嗯。

137
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:49,310
啊，咁人即係具體邊位即係有變動啦。咁但係實際上都係以一個工程總監咧，係負責呢幾個誒同時進行緊嘅鐵路項目。誒，其實呢個噉樣會唔會嗰個工作量會太重咧？就係其實睇翻轉頭咧，會唔會誒有？

138
00:26:49,310 --> 00:27:09,320
其他嘅即係管理上嘅安排，會使到高鐵香港段個進度咧，誒嗰個監督上誒風險管理上咧，都做得會更加係細緻，同埋係避免咗誒太多嘅疑問咧。咁阿梁啊，當時有冇足夠嘅專業？

139
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,900
支援係喺呢個工程方面啦。No, I thank you for that question. The

140
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:24,070
MTR， we have a very professional project management team. In fact, today that team has around 3,000 colleagues.

141
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:44,360
Each of the projects that we are undertaking is under a separate, is controlled and managed by a separate team. So there is a separate project manager for each of the new rail projects, including the Express Rail Link. Those project managers, of course, report.

142
00:27:44,360 --> 00:28:04,370
to the project director, I truly believe that we have not just a very professional, highly qualified project management team in our projects division, but they are industrious. They seek solutions to issues when they arise, and it is a very

143
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,150
Very professional team. Thank you. Yes, I think the question嗰個問題咧係。

144
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,840
Are they were they adequate?

145
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,160
啊！

146
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:35,450
In assessing the project management systems, I think the IBC also looked at this matter and they commented that the project management team is of a highly professional and have done their best to catch up with schedule delays whenever those issues.

147
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:55,460
arose係答唔答到你問題？誒答到啊，主席，我想問都喺呢環節，我想問最後一個，因為頭先我問咧都係由呢個誒港鐵公司嗰個管理層方面睇誒呢個誒風險管理啊項目嘅進度啊同埋疑問嘅問題誒，從另一個層面咧就係承建商嗰方面啦。

148
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:06,470
噉係就係梁生嘅經驗咧，就係你覺得我哋而家誒負責高鐵項目嘅嘅承辦商咧啊，同埋承承建商咧，佢哋。

149
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:21,240
是否真係誒能夠好配合咧去推動呢個高鐵項目？而另一方面咧，就喺管理上咧，係對於呢一方面嘅誒監督與推行咧，港鐵公司又是否做得足夠咧？咁？

150
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:41,570
No, no. Thank you for that question. We share the same objective as the contractors. The contractors have the same objective to complete the project, complete this project as quickly as possible. There is, as highlighted in the IPC report, very good and significant project management over these.

151
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,790
contractors， so the contractors and ourselves have and share the same objective.

152
00:29:48,970 --> 00:30:06,430
好，主席喺呢個環節，我暫時提問到呢度，唔該。好，阿譯志明議員。哇，唔該，主席喺呢度啊，先多謝阿梁生今日再次出席我哋呢個言訊。誒，第一個問題咧就係嗱，我哋睇翻咧港鐵公司嘅獨立董事委員會嘅第一份報告裏邊咧就講。

153
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:13,290
項目團隊對路政署係保留咗一啲關鍵嘅項目進度嘅信息。

154
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,080
而路政署嘅鐵路擴展處嘅處長陳志恩先生。

155
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:38,370
喺佢嘅陳述書裏邊咧就有講到嘅，佢話儘管路政署係記按呢個既定嘅匯報機制向港鐵公司要求提供資料，但係喺有啲情況之下咧，路政署係唔能夠適時地獲得呢啲嘅資料。嗱，噉我嘅問題咧有下列五個，第一。

156
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:52,850
個係對於獨立委員會嗰個嘅第一份報告嘅相關內容，同埋路政署阿陳先生指出港鐵有關嘅問題，我想聽一聽阿梁先生你對呢啲嘅講法嘅一啲回應。呢個第一。

157
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,330
第二咧，呢啲有關問題點解會發生咧？

158
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:03,470
當中係咪有港鐵嘅人員係做得唔妥當，甚至乎係有過失咧？

159
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:22,350
第三就係就呢個獨立委呢個董事委員會嘅第一份報告所指，項目團隊對路政署係保留咗一啲關鍵項目進度嘅信息。你可唔可以向我哋交代一下，當中係涉及一啲乜嘢嘅關鍵項目，同埋有啲咩信息咧？

160
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:32,860
第四咧就係，你會唔會認為港鐵公司係未有適當同埋適時地向路政署提供項目嘅相關資料？

161
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:43,200
係因為港鐵內部其實已經認為進度係無法追回，但又唔想咁快公開，咁咧就故咧，而咧係採取呢個下策。

162
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,020
咁如果港鐵係冇出現呢啲問題嘅話，咁又為何有所隱瞞咧？

163
00:31:49,360 --> 00:32:03,960
第五個最後一個問題就係喺高鐵項目嘅疑問問題上邊，你會唔會認同港鐵公司同政府之間嘅溝通同合作係足夠嘅？而目而嗰個目前嘅疑問係同政府無關。

164
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:25,070
唔該，主席，梁生五條問題。嗱，介紹啊，Thank you, honourable member. Firstly, I would say I would start by saying that there was full disclosure of all information to government, the Rail Development Office and other departments. This is well highlighted, I believe, both in the IPC.

165
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:45,080
and the IEP report, and I also believe that when Mr Kekilau and Mr Henry Chang were giving evidence, they also said that whenever our Development Office asked for information or documents from MTR, MTR would provide the information or documents to them.

166
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,760
啊！

167
00:32:46,530 --> 00:33:06,540
This full disclosure is, I believe, well communicated or well highlighted in the reports by the independent board committee of MTR as well as the independent expert panel IEP from government. I think the IBC report goes on in the same report that.

168
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:16,050
The honourable member mentioned to say that government RDO and MTR worked in a collaborative and cooperative manner.

169
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:34,020
我理解， and as highlighted in the first IBC report, the information which Mr. KK Lau and Mr. Henry Chang was referring to may be information relating to events in November of 2013.

170
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:54,420
not forgetting in at that period our projects director, our projects team was still trying to get further information from the contractor of one key project. This is contract number eight hundred and ten A to understand in full the timetable for their activities.

171
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:14,430
Without having that understanding and that information from the contractor, it is very difficult to it is it would be inappropriate to speculate at that time. So I believe that the project's team at that time was really waiting for the final timetable from the 810A contractor, which was only.

172
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:34,440
available in early 2014. So, in summary, Chairman, my view is that there was, and this is supported by the IBC and the IEP report, disclosure was in accordance with the entrustment agreement, the disclosure was in a timely manner, and there was adequate.

173
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,430
Disclosure.

174
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:57,050
啊！主席，我聽咗阿梁生嘅講法，噉你就歸咎咗喺一個特別嘅項目，因為未有一個充足評估啦。咁所以咧，你哋就啊未鋪咗一啲嘅information。但係如果你哋話畀我聽咧，你同政府合作無間咧，我又唔覺得呢啲問題點解唔可以攤出嚟，大家講清楚喎。

175
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:05,790
嚇，免咗個誤會，因為而家有兩個accusation係指住話你哋冇提供足夠資料嘛，係有蓄意隱瞞嘅感覺喎。

176
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:26,660
No, thank you, honourable member. Firstly, I would say that at no time was there any any intent or any thinking of hiding or withholding any information from any parties. There was significant disclosure of information, as well as many many meetings between.

177
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:46,670
Government representatives of government, MTR, as well as the so-called M and V consultant Jacobs, as members are aware, Jacobs had undertaken over 250 audits in that period. So there was constant exchange of information as well as disclosure, as I mentioned, as highlighted in the IP.

178
00:35:46,670 --> 00:36:04,350
ABC report， there was a collaborative and cooperative man manner was taken in the discussions between government and MTR to resolve the problems that were coming up in the project. So this was working together to resolve the problems.

179
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:24,640
Coming up, we take our responsibility very seriously under the entrustment agreement, and we have acted, I believe, in accordance with our obligations under the entrustment agreement. Once again, the the matter which honourable member mentioned relating to November two thousand and thirteen was at

180
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:42,530
時間當我們還在，或MTR，如在IBC報告中所指出，還在等待一個時間表，從810A承包商來看，這個所謂的最低運營方法是否可行。

181
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:55,540
Thank you, chairman。啊，主席，我就聽到梁生就即係覺得佢哋係冇蓄意隱瞞啦嚇，即係佢答我第一組嘅問題。嗱，噉我第二個問題咧，其實都同呢個嘅疑慮係有啲相關嘅。

182
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:04,770
誒有批評就話咧，誒呢個係一個好複雜嘅項目，我哋知道嘅，但係咧就冇一個所謂嘅integrated嘅master plan。

183
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,420
咁咧就呢個項目咧分拆四廿幾個合約嚇，有開工期，有個別嘅完工期。

184
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:19,360
但係咧，就因為有啲延而導致到有啲項目咧，後續個項目咧係延遲開工，但係又冇去修定嗰個嘅完工期。

185
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:31,550
咁咧又由於政府咧或者係監管嘅部分咧，又冇一個所謂嘅master plan，佢又睇唔到你嗰個所謂誒critical path影響到咩程度咧噉。

186
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:42,080
咁呢個喺項目管理嚟講，已經係一個問題本身已經存在啦嚇。咁但係我哋聽到有啲講法咧，上誒上一次嘅嘅聆訊咧嘅嘅言訊咧。

187
00:37:42,490 --> 00:38:02,500
就話其實咧，港鐵公司內部係有一個嘅啊，呢個所謂master plan嘅。不過咧就冇搦嚟同政府分享啫啊，即係我聽到係噉樣啦。如果我係聽錯嘅，主席你可以誒改修正我嚇。我想問啦，即係咁點解咧？既然你有，點解又唔同政府相關嘅監管部門分享？

188
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,800
大家可以溝通得更好，係咪蓄意隱瞞咧？又係。

189
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:26,410
梁生，Thank you, honourable member, for that question. Firstly, as the honourable member had mentioned, there is such an integrated master plan, and that integrated master plan is updated on a periodic basis, and also updated using the so-called P six Primavera software format. This is in

190
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,190
In accordance with the MTR project management approach.

191
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:51,480
the reporting on the member's question on reporting to government there was as I mentioned and continues to be very regular reporting to government. In fact, the monthly reports or the reports going to government, many of them stretch over two hundred pages. There was a lot of information in those.

192
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,460
報告。

193
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:13,550
啊！我想問一問就係你話個integrated嘅master plan咧。嗱，當然你一個咁大工程咧，你會涉及好多唔同嘅範疇啦。嚇，噉你係係咪即係一百樣嘅嘢，全部都係integrated嘅有個master plan喺度啊？就如果有嘅話咧，呢個master呢個integrated。

194
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:33,560
Integrated嘅master plan係咪淨係地鐵、港鐵公司知道啊？政府知唔知道呢個integrated嘅master plan嘅咧？啊，Chairman，firstly to confirm there is this integrated master programme， and in in fact in addition to the integrated master programme， we have the sync or track。

195
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:53,570
Related installation programme, which also supplements the integrated master programme to look at, amongst other things, the installation of electrical and mechanical systems. Once or at the time the civil works are completed. Once again, as I mentioned, there was regular reporting to.

196
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:13,580
政府，那包括過200頁的報告，on合同，as well as on cost and other aspects。Those reports were very much on a very regular basis.我我唔係講reporting嘅問題。如果你係有個噉嘅plan，係一個非

197
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,150
食嘅嘢係存在嘅。

198
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:23,910
咁嗰個政府係咪有呢嚿嘢咧？呢個integrated master program咧，係政府喺全國係畀咗政府嘅咧。

199
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,350
主席，我。

200
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:46,880
not in an I I'm not in a position to answer that question. I will have to revert to you on that. What we're very clear of is the reporting on the regular basis that has been given to government. These two hundred plus page reports, which looks at and talks about the overall programme as well as individual contracts as well as the cost aspects.

201
00:40:46,880 --> 00:41:06,890
我諗你check清咗之後，你翻嚟話翻畀我聽，因為點解咧？reporting還reporting，你個你嗰個誒，你個計劃咧，呢個整個協呢個係共融呢個計計劃嘅話咧，呢個計劃係政府係有冇嘅。你係咪全盤已經畀咗政府嘅？即係我唔講你reporting嗰句，reporting嗰句係做咗之後，你係根據嗰個。

202
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:26,900
你個plan嚟去去向政府報告啦。咁但係嗰個報告嗰個計劃咧，就政府本身有冇攞住喺手嗰度嚟睇呢個報告咧？呢個係亦都係好重要。我想你翻翻嚟話翻畀我聽，好嘛？出完之後，I can I revert，Chairman啊，唔該你啊，唔該主席，我仲有一個問題想問嘅。誒喺啊梁生。

203
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:39,890
你今日嘅發言稿裏邊嘅第九段咧，嗱，其實你第一次嚟嗰個言訊咧，你個個嘅誒文件咧都有嘅強調咧，就呢個勞工短缺所產生嘅問題。

204
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:55,970
誒，我喺度再次講咧，如果羅偉國議員都記得嘅咧，喺二零一三年十一月嗰個嘅事務委員會咧，我哋係質疑你哋有冇面對勞工短缺嘅問題嘅啊，因為呢個好可能係你言嘅其中一個主要因素。

205
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:15,650
但係當時你哋出席嘅同事咧，就再次強調咧，你哋唔受呢個勞工短缺嘅影響。我仲好記得黃國興議員咧，臨離開呢個會議室，當時嘅會議室咧，佢就話佢哋誒非常讚賞港鐵嚇，即係能夠喺咁困難嘅環境之下，能夠做到嚇，佢直頭封你哋做典範。

206
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:25,860
嗱，咁而家咧，我再一而再、再而三喺唔同嘅文件咧，睇到港鐵公司咧就開始咧就提出呢個勞工短缺對你哋嘅影響。

207
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,670
咁當時係咪有啲嘢想隱瞞咧？又係。

208
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,820
即係點解你唔肯當值就承認？即係你係受影響咧。

209
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:55,900
Thank you, honourable member, for that question. I was not at the particular meetings that the honourable member mentioned. However, the shortage of labour is a situation as highlighted by a number of parties that pertains across the whole construction industry. In fact.

210
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:15,910
I think in the IEP report there was a comment with regards to the labour situation, and that comment is that even back in July 2013, July 2013, the president of the Hong Kong Construction Association has identified in.

211
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:35,920
從survey of his organisation， that a vacancy rate, a shortage rate of fifteen percent is prevalent across the industry, which was equates at that time to ten thousand workers. So I would say that the shortage of labour is an issue that has impacted both the programme as.

212
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:55,930
Well, as importantly, the costs of the express rail link. Once again, there was never any. There's never any intent to withhold any information from from anyone. I think this labour shortage situation is well known in the.

213
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:15,940
We have, as a result of this labour shortage situation, done quite a bit to try to encourage more workers to either join the industry or to workers to come back into the industry. These include participation in job fairs. This includes working with relevant government.

214
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:23,170
Bureaus. This includes enhancing the enhancing the.

215
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:43,810
The on-site situation for our construction colleagues, which have aspects like life insurance being provided, health checks, etc. So we have done what we can to try to encourage more people to come in to the construction workforce.

216
00:44:43,810 --> 00:45:03,820
啊！主席，我當然誒明白阿梁生講乜嘢啦。我哋梗係覺得當時誒勞工短缺問題對你可能產生影響。我之所以同盧偉國議員會再三提問呢樣嘢嘛。咁但係喺一三年嘅月嘅十一月，你哋都唔想誒mit嚇承認你哋受影響，係咪因為當時你嘅出席嘅不當然？

217
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:23,830
問你又唔啱嘅，因為唔係你出席個會議啦嚇。咁咧就係誒擔心議員會追問，咁會唔會因此有言誤啊？噉你其實想避咗個問題啊。咁但係咧就去到二零一四終於爆煲啊，即係點解唔早啲承認有呢個問題咧？咁多謝主席。係啦，梁生啊，no thank you again for that question. The

218
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:24,360
係。

219
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:44,740
I think we have actually been quite open about the shortage of labour and the impact of labour shortage on the our projects, including the Express Rail Link. In fact, I have in front of me. This is a letter from Transport and Housing Bureau to the Secretary General of the.

220
00:45:44,740 --> 00:46:04,750
立法會顧問秘書處，22號1月2014，這必須係在參考22號11月2013，和在這在附表到那封信，它註明那，和我引述，而XRL項目需要約10,000個。

221
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:24,760
Construction workers and technical professional staff, contractors have so far employed around 8,500, and it gives a breakdown of the shortage of 1,500. So I think there has been regular and full disclosure of the challenges which.

222
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:36,050
We were facing in labour shortage. We have done, we do what we can to overcome those challenges, Chairman. And I mentioned some of the items that we have taken to try to overcome those challenges.

223
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,260
哦，唔該，excuse me。

224
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,490
好，下一位係。

225
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,040
恬不神怡。

226
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,600
即係。

227
00:46:45,720 --> 00:47:00,520
啊！我主要咧就係跟進翻上一次我同阿梁生嘅對話，有一個十二分鐘，有一個五分鐘，但問嚟問去咧都問唔到咩嘢，因為啊，梁生係其實好叻嘅。

228
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,550
好識回答問題。

229
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:08,270
不過今次咧，我就真係要即係認真，誒搞清楚。

230
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,400
我上次咧係想知道喺零九年。

231
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,700
港鐵同政府達成協議，五年之內六百幾億可以起到。

232
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,410
呢條高鐵。

233
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,180
係咪太過樂觀？

234
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,660
咁當時咧，阿梁生就三番四次話計個數。

235
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,880
doable, doable.

236
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,820
咁跟住我就問。

237
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:40,970
當時你哋其實明知冚碳不足，既然你知道冚碳不足。

238
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:49,980
點可能啊？話樂觀到五年起條六百幾億嘅鐵路可以誒doable咧？咁？

239
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,010
咁當時咧。

240
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,000
梁生嘅答案咧，就係話。

241
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:02,250
There was a lot of work done, and that work was also aided by a number of professional third parties in coming up with that programme.

242
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:09,810
There was an agreement and based on the work done, there was an assessment done, which was the schedule, the original programme, blah blah blah blah blah. Okay.

243
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,160
好啦。

244
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,560
喺你嘅第四十六段嘅。

245
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,880
陳述書嗰度咧，你都有話嘅。

246
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:29,990
誒喺西九龍總站嘅工地勘測咧，平均就每十四點四米咧就有個即係鑽孔啦。

247
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,710
咁呢個係符合啲標準嘅。

248
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,960
但係咧。

249
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,040
我所問嘅咧？

250
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,550
就係喺。

251
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,520
二零零九年，你同政府同意呢個。

252
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,580
時間表同埋呢筆，即係。

253
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,540
誒建築費。

254
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,650
一零年嚟立法會攞錢嘅時候咧。

255
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,570
其實咧。

256
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,760
成條佐敦道。

257
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,850
同埋成個高爾夫球會咧。

258
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,990
係完全冇恨嘆過。

259
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:12,340
我嘅記錄咧，你高爾夫球會去實施呢個十四點四米嘅陷潭咧，係二零一零年嘅三月。

260
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,750
咁嗰陣時咧，就已經過咗立法會攞到錢啦。

261
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,320
咁個問題係點解廣鐵可以叻到啊？

262
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,850
喺。

263
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,780
未勘探之前啊！

264
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,860
都可以知道勘探嘅結果咧。

265
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:37,310
而事實上咧，佐敦道由頭到尾都冇做過氹氹。

266
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,750
因為封路好麻煩。

267
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,440
而結果，我哋今日所知咧。

268
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:49,870
就係因為個護土牆要起喺佐敦道下邊，先至可以去挖掘嗰啲花崗巖。

269
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,520
而嗰個護土牆就遲咗一年嘅。

270
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:00,780
噉你當時係完全喺二零零九一零年嘅年初咧，係冇做過呢兩方面嘅談。

271
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:14,660
但係竟然咧就話咧誒呢啲嘢做到足，呢啲嘢做到足係攞完錢之後事後發生嘅事。我而家問係當時同政府嗰個誒協議。

272
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:21,920
係二零一五年通車，六百六啊幾七啊億嗰陣時，你係完全冇呢啲資料嘅。

273
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:31,710
但係梁總裁，你都三番四次話There was a lot of work done，但呢啲work done was after。

274
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,730
The.

275
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:47,880
the the agreement between you and government on the time frame and the expenses呢係用中文，一係用英文，如果咪就變咗好難好難記載嘅。你要你啲法。

276
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:58,350
誒，咁誒，你想我用一句語言係嘛？因為我諗住如果係雙語咧，我容易啲表達，不過。

277
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,770
冇問題啦，我諗啊梁總在聽到盡量啦，好唔好啊？好啊，好啊。

278
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,230
係，阿梁總裁。

279
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:25,520
即係我始終要搞清楚呢件事啊。No, thank you, honourable member for that question. As the honourable member mentioned, there was a lot of work done before the signing of the entrustment agreement, and there were a number of experts and third party involved, both from government as well as from us.

280
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:45,530
There was significant site investigation done prior to signing the SoCo EA2. As the honourable member mentioned, however, at Jordan Road we cannot do site investigation there because of the volume of traffic, and it was inappropriate to close the road to do site investigation on the golf.

281
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:58,460
Driving range, the golf driving range in West Kowloon, as the honourable member mentioned, there was site investigation done after after we took possession of the site. The with

282
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,420
Large complicated projects like the express rail link, there is.

283
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:16,570
A lot of work that needs to be done in the initial stages, and there is in the assessment of the cost to complete a contingency. The there are matters which

284
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:36,860
Would always impact the project. That would not be known at the beginning of the project. The contingency is there to take care and address those issues. I would highlight once again that after the tender contracts came back, and this is well highlighted in the IEP report, because of the lower.

285
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:56,870
tender prices, the contingency, the amount of contingency actually increased very significantly. So it is with the use of the contingency allows for unknown factors which may not have been known at the time of entering into the project agreement. I would further add in terms of the granite that.

286
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:10,900
The presence of the granite is known. It is just the formation of that granite that was perhaps less certain. And the issue was that the granite can be removed. It is a question of time to remove it.

287
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:21,560
主席，呢個就係正正嘅問題啦。即係聽阿梁生講咧，就話佢明知道當時係勘探不足。

288
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,940
啊！去到個程度咧，成條佐敦道即係嗰個成個護土牆啊！

289
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,860
嗰個位置啊，完全冇做咁淡。

290
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:40,380
同埋咧，成個高爾夫球練習場咧冇做過，我諗大家都知道個場幾大㗎啦，就正正今日西九總站佔咗大部分。

291
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:57,460
一個咁關鍵性嘅弧道場嘅位置，同成個高爾夫球場喺一零年嚟立法會攞錢冇做過冚攤噉啊。梁生咧就話：錢咧佢係預得松嘅，佢認為如果真係有意想不到嘅嘢咧，佢都用錢可以搭救。

292
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,490
噉，但係時間咧，梁生。

293
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,100
時間唔係錢買得到㗎。

294
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,870
咁時間點咧？

295
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:26,200
首先，Tim，perhaps I could just comment on the site investigation. There was significant site investigation done, and as I had mentioned last time, the site investigation was in line with government guidelines and in fact of a higher standard.但梁生唔好意思，你而家重複緊。

296
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:46,210
你之前已經承認最緊要嗰兩個陷探係一零年三月之後先做嘅，而佐敦道根本從來都冇做過。你只不過正話答咧就係錢嗰度咧，你預得好松啊，認為就算真係誒有意想不到嘅嘢咧，你都可以補到。但係我而家問係問時間，啲時間買唔？

297
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:59,090
翻嚟㗎嘛？你五年啊，點可能預啊？下邊嗰八萬五立方米嘅花崗巖啊，全部係左端到下低，而你挖得咁辛苦咧，係咪？咁嗰陣時你係咪真係太樂觀啊？

298
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:19,890
Chairman, so with the the adequate site investigations that were done for the project, with regards to the timetable, as members are aware and well highlighted in the IEP report, there were a number of third parties that reviewed and looked at the timetable, the programme to complete.

299
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:25,950
Together with MTR, and all along the

300
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:46,240
而家講緊係一零年嚟立法會攞錢兩三，唔係講緊幾年後喎。嗰陣時你憑咩嘢認為啊？一個咁大嘅範圍冇勘探，你竟然可以拍心口話五年。

301
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,380
交貨啊！

302
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,340
你承唔承認當時非常之粗疏？唔係你，唔係你本人。

303
00:55:52,680 --> 00:56:12,690
OK，成個港鐵高層、主席、董事局非常之粗疏。係劉生，Thank you, honourable member for that question. Once again, I it is my view, and from all the reports that we have seen, that adequate, adequate site investigation had been done。你點可以講呢句？

304
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:32,700
或者你啱啱先承認一零年一月嚟立法會攞錢，正話嗰兩個地方乜嘢陷探都冇，點可以？你而家話你覺得係adequate咧？係啊，或者畀個機會阿梁生答答佢意思就係你未作出呢個咁重要嘅位置，你冇作出嘅陷探，點可以同即係承諾話？

305
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,260
五年內可以係完成呢個工程。

306
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,480
No, I thank you for that question, Chairman. The

307
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:54,580
Not forgetting that the site investigation, and I apologise, apologise if I'm repeating myself here. If the site investigation was of a standard that met government guidelines and a higher standard than across the construction industry.

308
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:14,870
The West Kaloon Terminus is eleven hectares. The Jordan Road area is but one part of that, and I believe a relative.哥爾夫球場幾大？I do not have, chairman. The至少都幾個公頃啦。誒，嗱，即係畀畀個機會佢答答啦，好嘛？

309
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:34,880
主席啊，佢冇呢個資料，我就係想講一句嘢。唔係OK，佢冇資料，佢話主席，我就係想講一句嘢啫。好唔好？好，即係我覺得我係實事。呢個你comment嚟嘅係咪？係我comment啊！我係同你講嘅，主席，我覺得我係實事求是，將將當時嘅情況攞出嚟，但係我覺得。

310
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,370
我聽到嘅回應係完全係避而不答，避而不答，重複緊一樣唔合邏輯嘅嘢。

311
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,540
咁講真咧，我其實真係幾失望。

312
00:57:45,020 --> 00:58:03,870
其實佢直情認佢當時係冇睇到呢樣嘢，咁疏忽咗其實好簡單啫嘛。係，但係佢一路話當時咧有曬呢啲噉嘅資料，但係當時冇啊，係事後先有啫嘛。我個問題係當時佢憑咩承諾五年做到啊嘛？

313
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:24,230
啱啱咪，大家大家都得到佢嘅答案。佢答到中唔足夠，大家會做咧。我哋會做個評評，我哋做做個評估嘅答案中唔足夠啦，好嘛？OK，Chairman，I could also，梁生係畀個機會你再有有冇有補充係咪？係，先生，主席，請講。I would。

314
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:44,240
首先，Westcarrloan terminus is a very large, eleven hectares site. There were four hundred bore, six hundred boreholes drilled for site investigation on that site, spaced fourteen point four metres apart. I would also say that in the Jordan Road area, in the Jordan Road area, we have available.

315
00:58:44,240 --> 00:59:04,250
existing data of the utilities situation under Jordan Road. So when the agreement was the second entrustment agreement was signed with government, we have existing data with regards to the utilities situation under Jordan Road as well as.

316
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,940
啲細 investigations we have done係咁高球場咧。

317
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:28,230
嗱，你講唔出有幾大啊？個十一公頃之中，高球場至少都有幾公頃話，係咪？啊，嗰個算唔算大咧？Chairman, thank you for that question. The the golf driving range is of course in two components. There is a driveway with a parking lot, and there is the driving range itself. As I understand it from the various reports.

318
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:48,240
ports， there was certain investigation done in the driveway and the parking lot. Although, of course, we were not able to close the driving range. 啊，好唔該。我聽，如果你再有問題，第二輪啊，田北辰議員，我想都想跟進一下關於呢個氫探問題。啲因為路政處嗰個誒陳志恩先生曾經。

319
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:57,640
指出咧，佢導致高鐵項目嘅延誤咧，有好多原因。其中一個咧，就係涉及呢個工程工地嘅勘測同埋呢個項目設計嘅。

320
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:13,820
噉就我想問一問就係誒喺呢個誒工地呢個勘察嘅方面咧，港鐵公司係投放咗有幾多資源啊？包括嘅人手同費用噉樣，你有冇一個粗略嘅一個估計咧，梁生？

321
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,080
啊。

322
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:35,370
主席，我唔係有嗰個信息，可能我會有啲資料，但係我唔係有嗰個資料。

323
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:41,960
範疇嘅估算咧同埋預算係出現較大較大嘅偏差，會唔會有噉嘅情況出現咧？梁生。

324
01:00:42,240 --> 01:01:02,250
Chairman, my understanding, and this is also in the various reports by the IBC and the IEP, my understanding is that there was adequate site investigation done, which includes the depth of the various holes and the boreholes drilled. Those boreholes are drilled 14.4 metres apart.

325
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:20,000
There could be undulation of rocks or different core stones between those 14.4 metres. So there was significant site investigation done, which is in accordance with government's guidelines and even of a higher standard than used in the industry.

326
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,910
O.K.咁如果係冇呢個疏忽同埋不足嘅話，

327
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:37,330
噉就誒，咁當然係，你會對呢個不可預知同埋難以預測嘅因素情況咧，都會有個比較上誒好嘅掌握啦。應該就嚇。

328
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:45,360
噉係咪誒？噉你有冇因應呢啲噉嘅問題咧？係制定一啲緩衝期咧？係工程嘅。

329
01:01:46,340 --> 01:02:02,140
咁如果係有嘅話，點解會仲要出現咁多噉嘅言？你明白我我個問題？我問題就係你係如果係有你有較為掌握一啲噉嘅不即係難以預測嘅情況嘅話咧，你都會對佢有一個基本嘅掌握。咁有冇？

330
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,190
你。

331
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:10,790
用啲誒手段咧，係作出一啲緩衝期，啲工程緩衝期，緩衝期，咁咧唔會導致有咁多疑問。

332
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:31,350
I think, chairman, as I mentioned, although the ground investigation done is in line with government guidelines and higher industry standards, with boreholes being fourteen four metres apart, there's unfortunately the unfortunately.

333
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:38,210
times when issues with rocks will be missed just because of the rock formation.

334
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:58,500
I think on the schedule, there was a lot of work done with regards to the original schedule and the programme to complete. And once again, with the information at hand, the experts were of the view that the programme to complete.

335
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:06,190
With the knowledge of the site conditions, was adequate, was doable but tight.

336
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,490
Alright. Okay.

337
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,200
何孟政議員。

338
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:26,420
Thank you, Mr. Leung. In your opening statement, you said the overall completion progress of the project is now, as of today, 74%.

339
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:31,320
I.E. just under three quarters.

340
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:36,740
of completion. Now, those figures hardly impressive.

341
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:49,390
I'd say, and you did mention towards the end of your statement that there are still challenges in the remaining construction works. I just wonder.

342
01:03:49,700 --> 01:04:08,390
What may be the largest challenge remaining? Question one, that is. And my question number two is: you keep, well, we we kept we keep getting allegations, if not accusations, that

343
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:29,260
The MTRC had withheld information from the government, in particular the highways department, and you kept telling us previously that oh no no no, whatever information they needed, we would have disclosed.

344
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,810
但係，problem是，一，We don't know what we don't know。

345
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:43,900
I mean, one cannot ask questions when one doesn't know what to ask, right? So on this.

346
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:59,700
information disclosure business，would you say would you acknowledge that the MTRC had behaved somewhat improperly，if not dishonestly？

347
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,010
Question number two, and my.

348
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:13,190
第三個問題是，先前你也 acknowledge 了，當它來到風險管理。

349
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:22,940
你用質質的評估 for timetables and so on， measuring what you call robustness。

350
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:29,970
and then of course you use quantitative assessment for costs and things.

351
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:50,260
Would you now, with hindsight, acknowledge that there were so many incompatibilities between the two? Your overly optimistic approach in qualitative assessment has out

352
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,330
Ultimately led to your quantitative.

353
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,590
wrong assessments， right？

354
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,100
三個問題， for the time being， thank you.

355
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,780
兩三，嗯，嗱。

356
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:25,410
Thank you, honourable member, for the for those questions. Firstly, on the challenges which the project continues to face, as the honourable member rightly mentioned, the project is seventy four percent complete. The tunnel sections between the West Kowloon terminus and the border with

357
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:45,420
San Juan is now over ninety nine percent complete, dug through, excavated. We have only just around one hundred metres of tunnel left to go out of twenty five plus kilometre twin track twin bore tunnel. The challenges which the project will continue to face. Once again, the

358
01:06:46,150 --> 01:07:06,160
shortage of labour, particularly in the so-called electrical mechanical, the E and M phase that the project is coming into, this will be a challenge, and of course we would have we will have our our measures to try to overcome those that particular challenge. Secondly, the erection and construction.

359
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:26,170
Of the so-called station entrance building, which incorporates the atrium and roof of the structure, that will also be a challenge for the project. And thirdly, the productivity rate in physically building the structure. I mentioned that there has been reasonable progress in.

360
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:38,040
在terms of the physical building of the structure, but that structure still needs to be completed. So those are some of the challenges going forward with regards to this particular project.

361
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:43,880
The second question on information. Once again.

362
01:07:44,380 --> 01:08:04,390
There was significant information and amount of information provided to government. This is well highlighted in the independent expert panel, the IEP report as well as the IBC report. There were not just information provided. There was very regular meeting between government officials and ourselves.

363
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:24,400
on top of that, as highlighted in the IEP and the IPC report, government has the M and V consultant Jacobs, who were also looking at the whole project. And in fact, as I mentioned before, during this period, the M and V consultant had themselves.

364
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:35,640
undertakeن250 audits. Their findings were reported to government, and there would be follow-on and follow-up of such findings.

365
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:56,730
I think the third question, which really comes back to risk management, the qualitative and the quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment is a methodology that has worked very well in the past. It has delivered a number of our previous rail projects. It is a part of

366
01:08:56,730 --> 01:09:02,730
The project management systems which we have to follow under the entrustment agreements.

367
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:23,020
The project management systems, as members are aware, was reviewed prior to government and MTR entering into the second entrustment agreement. And in fact, the various reviews comes up with words such as robust, good control, best of breed, and internal.

368
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:43,030
和評估，那會suggest that it is of a very high standard. It is based on that that I understand government entered into the second entrustment agreement with the governance and processes that were also put into place. So the qualitative assessment is an assessment with

369
01:09:43,030 --> 01:10:03,040
Which one has worked well in the past. Secondly, it's part of the processes that we have had and that we are supposed to follow. And thirdly, part of the process that has been reviewed prior to entering into the entrustment agreements and have been well commented on, and in fact has been have been.

370
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,290
by the experts involved.

371
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:23,500
主席，Mr. Chairman，can I understand that Mr. Leung has practically categorically denied any improper or dishonest conduct when it comes to information disclosure?

372
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:43,920
exactly what you're saying呢個係好或者你係咪咁即係噉嘅意思啊？梁生，Chairman，I I I would say that at no time was there any intent, any intent in on behalf on the part of MTR to hide or withhold any information. The information as requested was provided.

373
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:52,570
There was a collaborative, cooperative working environment between government departments and ourselves.

374
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:58,330
That is, those are well borne out in the IBC and the IEP report.

375
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:18,720
冇噉嘅意圖，黃邦政議員佢話。Right, ah, my very last question. Um, there's no point to ask Mr. Leung whether there's any negligence on the part of himself or the MTRC. Right, that is um, well, futile question. But again, with

376
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:36,820
hindsight， you did say the MTRC is he had behaved somewhat overly optimistic in the over the entirety of the project， something to that effect。

377
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,540
what could have done better?

378
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:52,950
或，how you could have done better， in any way， in what areas or on what fronts， speaking， as of today。

379
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,830
唔該，多謝你 for that question, honourable member, as

380
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:01,880
As I mentioned at the last meeting, the

381
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:22,170
過optimism of the the project team led to MTR reporting late, reporting late the delay. I do not the overoptimism did not lead to the delay. It was the overoptimism led to the late reporting of the delay. The delay, the causes of delay are well.

382
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:30,460
highlighted in the various reports, and I will not go into that again. With due respect, isn't that just a word game?

383
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,630
啊！

384
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:53,130
Remember the what MTR has done in answer to your question is from the reports of the independent board committee. There were a number of recommendations made by the independent board committee. MTR has followed those recommendations and implemented.

385
01:12:53,130 --> 01:13:13,140
或的建議，那些建議，一次再，，好高亮在報告中，包括一，的設立一個資本工程委員會，資本工程委員會現在已經運作數個月，第二，它包括對報告機制的加強，那些加強包括使用所謂。

386
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:21,710
或交通燈， as well as the use of milestones. Those have all been incorporated in our processes.

387
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,190
我 rest，我 rest。

388
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,990
誒，下一位。

389
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:46,280
係誒範國威員，好啊，唔該，主席。誒，我想問啊，梁國強先生啊，關於你喺上一次嘅言訊裏邊咧，你就好清楚講咗，就話拒絕去承認港鐵咧喺高鐵工程超支延誤呢一件事上邊咧，係有任何嘅隱瞞嘅。你話？

390
01:13:46,280 --> 01:14:00,820
冇隱瞞，更加咧就話呢個委託協議咧就冇施加呢個叫絕對的義務嚇，絕對嘅義務就要求港鐵喺二零一五年嘅八月之前要完成工程，同埋咧設定呢個工程費用嘅上限。

391
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:21,110
但係梁國權先生，你上次嘅言訊咧，你當其時答我問題咧，講得好清楚，冇越絕對義務呢個講法，而唔係委託協議書裏邊白紙黑字嘅條文噉樣係。即係換言之咧，換言之咧，呢個係你口講，呢個你嘅講法係你單方面嘅理解。

392
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:41,120
OK，咁所以我想問啦，就係既然港鐵認為委託協議裏邊嘅員工時間可以係修定，係冇梁先生、李閣下講嘅絕對義務係按時係去完成工作嘅。主席，我第一個問題就係話點解上一任嘅行政總裁偉達成先生？

393
01:14:41,120 --> 01:15:01,130
會喺二零一三年嘅十一月同當期時運輸及房屋局嘅緊急會議上邊，就要求政府唔好向我哋立法會嘅鐵路事小組報告通車日期係有所延誤，同埋反對政府咧就將工程延誤原原本本噉。

394
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,380
樣咧係向公眾交代咧。

395
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:23,670
第二就係當其時，你哋嘅反對理據咧，就係因為港鐵要喺二零一五年，即係今年通車嘅死線嘅deadline，所以咧係可以向呢個誒承建商施壓去趕趕工嘅。咁港鐵點解係不惜係要提高呢個嘅成本，畀更加多嘅錢都要打？

396
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:43,680
至二零一五年嘅通車嘅目標咧，如果梁先生你講話冇呢個絕對義務，誒係要去完工嚇，要喺二零一五年嘅八月之前完工嚇，你其實係咪講緊或者係間接承認咗港鐵係有責任係去按時完工嘅咧？係主席呢個係。

397
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,940
我第一個問題係。

398
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,020
梁生，請你答。

399
01:15:48,300 --> 01:16:08,310
Thank you, Chairman, for that question. I think first and foremost, MTR, we take our responsibility under the entrustment very, very seriously, and we take all steps to ensure that we meet our obligation under the entrustment agreement, as I mentioned last time. And I think it's well highlighted in the IEP report.

400
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:28,320
This is the independent expert panel report, which is commissioned by government. It is well highlighted in the factual annexure by Price Waterhouse Coopers, on the basis that the timetable to complete, as well as the cost to complete, are estimates in the entrustment agreement and subject to change.

401
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:48,350
In fact, the IEP report very clearly sets out what the mechanisms are to adjust the timetable in the interest time. Chairman, I will not read out the relevant paragraph. The member mentioned the meeting in November of two thousand and thirteen. I was not.

402
01:16:48,350 --> 01:17:08,360
Personally, at that meeting, so I do not know what was said in that meeting. All I have is from our IBC report, which has interviewed all the a number of people who were present at that meeting. As I understand it, in that particular meeting in November two thousand and thirteen.

403
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:28,370
With the previous CEO, the comment from the IBC report or the comment in the IBC report was that the previous projects director and the previous CEO were of the view that to keep pressure on the contractors, to keep pressure on the contractors.

404
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:41,280
It is important to keep to that 2015 opening date. That is in accordance with the IBC report. Because I was not in that meeting, I really cannot comment otherwise on what they have said.

405
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:59,170
主席，個問題唔係你當其時喺唔喺個會議上邊，而係港鐵嘅行為係證明咗客觀上邊你哋係有責任按時係去完工嚇，你客觀上係證明咗呢樣嘢。主席，我第二個問題就係，或者等佢答咗先好啊。啊，第

406
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:19,510
As I mentioned under the entrustment agreement, this is well highlighted in the IEP report. MTR, we have to use our best endeavours, which we have under the entrustment agreement. The timetable and the cost to complete are estimates, which are subject to adjustments in accordance with that.

407
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:39,520
trust agreement係唔該，佢佢重複緊佢答案啦，已經係嚇主席。我第二個問題就係十月廿二號鐵路拓展處處長同埋副處長嚟，我哋嘅言訊咧就引用咗港鐵獨立董事委員會嘅報告，就話港鐵嘅項目團隊向路政署隱瞞咗係隱。

408
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:59,530
瞞咗項目進度嘅關鍵資訊，嚇，亦即係項目團隊喺二零一三年十一月嘅分析結果係工程完工嘅日期咧，係會延誤去到二零一六年嘅鐵路拓展署更加喺言訊裏邊咧，係清楚指出港鐵隱瞞關鍵資。

409
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:19,540
資訊而導致到政府咧係做咗呢個叫做工程滯後，不等於最終係延誤呢個錯誤嘅判斷噉樣。所以梁國權先生，你會唔會同意就係港鐵喺項目中進度上邊係有誤導路政署？嚇，你早前嘅陳述書裡。

410
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:39,550
裏邊第一百三十段咧，就話港鐵從來係從來冇蓄意隱瞞重要嘅資料。你點樣回應路鐵路拓展署呢一個咁嚴重嘅指控？話你哋係項目進度關鍵嘅資訊，你哋係隱瞞咗。你點樣去回應當日嘅言訊裏邊，政府部門？

411
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:41,010
代表講嘅説話。

412
01:19:41,290 --> 01:20:01,300
I thank you for the question, Honourable Member. Firstly, as I highlighted, there was at all times full disclosure of information to government and the various departments of government. There were regular meetings, significant number of regular meetings, as well as the government's so-called M and V consultant, J.

413
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:21,310
We're also auditing and doing a significant body of work based on the information. And in addition to the information which we have given, this disclosure of information and following the requirements under the entrustment agreement, I believe are well highlighted in both the IBC and.

414
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:41,320
The IEP report. Once again, I understand that the statement which Mr. K. K. Lau and Mr. Henry Chang was made was referring to an event back in November of 2013. As I have responded to another honourable member's question on this particular matter.

415
01:20:41,320 --> 01:21:01,330
At that time, the project team was still awaiting. Was still awaiting a programme from the contractors. This was the A Ten A contractor on whether the minimum operating requirement, the so-called MOR, was achievable or not. This request for.

416
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:21,340
A programme from the contractor of 810A, as I understand it, was also a request from the various members of government. So at that time in November 2013, the event that is being that has been highlighted, the project's team was still awaiting for.

417
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:31,510
一個program from the contractor to see whether the program, the revised or the program to complete, can be achieved or not.

418
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:52,250
主席，我問佢嘅問題，問佢嘅責任有冇隱瞞資料，佢而家又將個責任推咗喺承建商嗰度，喺度等嗰啲嘅資訊。主席，我時間剩翻唔多，我想問埋第三個問題，亦都係上一次嘅言訊裏邊講到呢個工程前期工作緊縮嘅誒準準備時間，就導致咗呢個合約編號八一零A八一零。

419
01:21:52,250 --> 01:22:12,260
B同埋八一一A三項涉及到西九龍總站嘅合約咧，係需要做呢個設計修訂。你喺會後裏邊咧，就透過書面係去答我哋本會嗰陣時咧，就話影響同承建商談判作為理由咧，係去拒絕披露呢三份合約裏邊做出嘅修訂次數同。

420
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:32,270
埋內容而只係引述獨立專家小組報告指出，就八一零A合約去到二零一三年嘅六月，已經係有一萬三千五百一十三次嘅修訂，涉及改正錯別字啊、釐清差異啊、提供額外資料嘅細微修改。我想問梁國權先生，你係用乜？

421
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:52,280
嘢嘅準則係去定義，係去define呢一萬幾千次嘅修訂，只係細微嘅修改咧。噉樣係，例如如果係以進度影響作為準則，一或係用工程成本係作為準則咧，我嘅質疑，我嘅疑問就係話積少成多，聚沙成塔。呢一萬三千幾個細細微。

422
01:22:52,280 --> 01:23:12,290
嘅更改係咪就係最終係導致咗更加多重大嘅改動，而令到呢個工程延誤，又或者係政府口裏邊講嘅滯後，係變成咗無可挽回。你哋過去做嘅追回進度好多嘅措施，都係唔能夠追回到個進度咧，係一。

423
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:15,370
一萬三千五百一十三次喎，主席。

424
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,110
梁生。

425
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:37,430
No, thank you for that question. As highlighted in the IEP report, this is on paragraph 104 of the IEP report. That report does highlight that, as by June 2013, there were 13,513 revised drawings, as also highlighted in the IEP report.

426
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:57,440
And in our response to a similar question last time, these a number many of these amendments in drawings would be of a minor nature. I would firstly perhaps also say that it is not uncommon for tenders for

427
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:17,450
要被 tendered once they have reached a certain maturity in design. In the case of 810A, the contract that the honourable member mentioned, that that particular contract had reached a maturity of design that allowed it to be tendered. It is also not uncommon for in these very

428
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:37,460
Complicated projects for there to be design adjustments. Design adjustments after the contract has been tendered out. The honourable member mentioned the one thirteen five hundred and thirteen drawings were part of these design adjustments. A number of these design adjustments would have been relatively minor in nature. Some of these design adjustments related to

429
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:57,470
到建設困難，哪個被面臨？例如，地質條件，高亮在第104段的IEP報告，作為一些這些修改圖紙會有附加H柱。附加H柱是因為地質條件困難，特別是他們在一個案例中。

430
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:17,480
War on the western part of the West Kowloon site. A third cause of the design changes could be changes requested by third parties. So there are a number of causes for these design changes. I would, however, say that many of these design changes when

431
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,810
再次，都係屬於一個非常

432
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:32,790
were the result of difficulties encountered during construction, and thirdly, some of these design changes were also the result of third-party requests. Thank you, Chairman.

433
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:43,940
誒，我諗個議員佢問嘅問題就係話，有因為個數量咁多嘅話咧，佢累積起上嚟會唔會係作作會成為一個嚴嘅一個一個好大嘅原因咧？

434
01:25:44,290 --> 01:26:04,300
我會説，在一係數個case，設計變更係屬較小的，其他變更係因為施工困難，施工困難可能造成延誤或變更進度，但係施工。

435
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:24,310
Construction difficulties then resulted and required different and amended or adjusted design. And thirdly, there could have been design changes from third parties. So it is actually a complicated interaction and interplay of many factors when one looks at these design changes as well as the difficulties encountered.

436
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,330
在Construction。

437
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:35,510
或者我哋誒，或者我再跟進多一條問題啦。你我哋而家大家都知道啦。

438
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,900
係誒，你嘅前任個個總裁咧。

439
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:53,250
就係講佢公司前任總裁咧，就係曾經喺誒三年十一月咧，就同局長講我哋翻説話，就係話為咗係佢堅持咧，就唔畀局長向呢個誒。

440
01:26:53,540 --> 01:27:12,690
我哋嘅立法會嘅鐵路小組同埋公眾咧，係開誠佈公，係即係可能會有一個言。咁為咗咧，就係要為向嗰啲誒承建商施加壓力。咁呢個做法咧，即係唔向呢個立法會鐵路小組開誠佈公咧，呢個做法你作為一個。

441
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:32,980
高層嘅港鐵公司人員咧，係咪認同啊？嗯，Jeremy，Firstly, I would say that at no time was there ever any intention to withhold any information from government or the Legislative Council. Once again, I was not at that meeting when in November twenty.呢個做法，我先問你，我。

442
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:52,990
知道你當時唔在場，啲事事事先事先，我亦都係即係聽你嘅誒答案咧，亦都係唔知情㗎啦嚇。咁但係即係而家係聽翻轉頭咧，你會唔會認同呢噉嘅做法咧？Chairman，oh，I would my response would be that it is never and will never be MTR's intention to withhold any

443
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:56,290
信息從政府或立法會。
