34
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:11,940
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll do a few opening remarks, then I'll ask Ada to take us through the PowerPoint to expand on what I'm going to say. Mr. Chairman, this paper sets out the Housing Authority's public housing construction programme for the period 201314 to 201718.

35
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:30,490
以 concerted efforts of various departments, the government has identified sufficient land to provide about 179,000 public rental housing units from the period 201213 to 202122 to meet the 2013 policy address flat production target.

36
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:45,560
According to the housing authority's five-year rolling public housing construction programme, there will be a total public rental housing production of about 82,000 flats in the five-year period from 201314 to 201718.

37
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:59,940
for the home ownership scheme flats, the first batch of about 2,200 flats, located in Shatin, Chun Wan, Kwai Chung and Yuen Long, will be completed in 2016-17. Construction on these sites has already commenced.

38
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:20,370
在 addition， Housing Authority has successfully worked with other government departments and bureau to identify suitable sites for home ownership scheme development in different areas of the territory， to ensure that a total of about seventeen thousand home ownership scheme units will be completed， from two o one six one seven to two o one nine.

39
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,440
2.0， in accordance with the government's commitments.

40
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:41,580
我 must stress that the construction programme is dynamic in nature and something that we keep under constant review. Progress on individual sites will depend on a number of factors such as land availability, site constraints, technical issues and other factors.

41
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:49,190
In fact, we also need to address various issues relating to the planning and provision of local community and transport facilities.

42
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,880
The five-year programme that we're providing today is based on the current information, and therefore subject to change, especially.

43
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:18,170
those projects were due for completion in the fifth year, in other words, two hundred one seven one eight. Projects for completion beyond the five year period are even more uncertain, so we're focusing on the first five year period. Mr Chairman, I'd like to invite Ada to take us briefly through the presentation and expand on some of our particular information. Thank you.

44
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,750
啊！請阿馮馮裕軒誒。

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,730
唔使。

46
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:31,170
主席、各位議員，我現在就二零一三一四至一七一八年度嘅公營房屋建設計劃作一個詳細介紹。

47
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:45,640
大家熟悉就係政府同埋房屋委嘅宗旨咧，係為冇能力去租住私人住宅嘅低收入家庭咧，提供公共嘅租住房屋，並以維持一般申請者嘅平均輪候時間約係三年為目標。

48
00:06:45,920 --> 00:07:05,040
喺二零一三年嘅施政報告裏邊咧，行政長官宣佈公屋建屋嘅量咧，就係目標就係為喺二零一三、二零一三年嗰五年內咧，就係落成約七萬五千個新公屋單位，同埋喺二零一八年嘅五年內咧，就總共係供應。

49
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,420
量係至少為十萬個單位。

50
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:17,920
而喺居者有其屋居屋方面咧，目標就係喺年一六一七年度起嘅四年內咧，提供約一萬七千個居屋單位。

51
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,690
由於興建公屋所用嘅土地，

52
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:35,270
規劃建設同埋資源調配等等多項嘅因素咧，房屋好似係制定以五年為期，逐年延展嘅公營房屋建設計劃，並按需求情況咧，係對嗰個建屋量作出適當嘅調整。

53
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:50,830
咁睇翻我哋喺二零一二一三一七嗰五年頭五年期內咧，總建屋量約為係七萬九千個單位。夠行政長官於二零一三年施政報告中承諾嘅七萬五千單位咧，增加咗四千個單位嘅。

54
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:59,060
房委會喺二零一二一三年度咧，就已經係建成咗係一萬三千一百一十四個單位。

55
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:13,870
咁按照房委會逐年延展嘅公營房屋建設計劃咧，我哋喺二零一三一四年至二零一七一八年度嗰五年期間咧，將會係合共興建約八萬二千個新公屋單位嘅。

56
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:36,050
喺二零一七一八至二零二一二二年度第二個五年期內咧，經過各相關政府部門嘅努力，我哋都物識咗足夠嘅土地，可以興建超過十萬個單位。能否盡早如期將公屋建成嘅關鍵咧，仍然取決於係咪可以啊得到已經規劃作。

57
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:46,460
住宅用途嘅土地啦，以及係已完成收回清拆同埋地盤平整，並附有適當嘅基基建同埋設施等等嘅土地。

58
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:58,180
加上，如果我哋順利可以得到地區誒嘅區議會同埋地區人士嘅支持，同埋有足夠人力資源咧，我就可以將籌劃中嘅項目咧提前完成嘅。

59
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:14,360
咁喺睇翻未來五年裏邊咧，新建區嘅供應咧主要係來自市區啦，大約五十二percent，擴展市區三十二percent，同埋係新界區咧就係十六percent。咁可以話即係超過八成。

60
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
一百有八成半咧，都係喺市區或者係擴展市區裏邊嘅。

61
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:41,170
而喺個單位組合裏邊咧，喺二零一三、一四至一六、一七年度嘅新建公屋單位中咧，預計約十九percent就係為誒一人、二人單位，約二十五percent就係二人、三人嘅單位，約三啊九percent就係一睡房單位供三至四人居住啦，同埋十六percent。

62
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,030
就係兩住房單位，供四人以上居住嘅。

63
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,380
啊，另外就係區際嘅規劃啦。

64
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,920
首批將於二零一六一七年度落成嘅居屋項目咧，分別係位於沙田。

65
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:13,210
誒荃灣、葵青同埋元朗區已經動工啦，預計可以提供約二千二百個單位。此外，房委會同埋相關政嘅政策局同埋政府部門緊密合作，我哋已經係成功喺全港唔同嘅地區物識咗一啲適合發展為居屋嘅土地。

66
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,380
確保喺二零一七至二零一九二零年度內咧，可以合共興建約一萬七千個單位嘅。

67
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:41,530
至於現一八一九年度同埋以後嘅項目咧，現受到好多誒唔同嘅因素影響啦，例如係改變土地用途啦，誒同埋整合地區人士嘅意見喺地區諮詢方面，以及係適時咧嘅土地供應等等。因此喺現階段咧，未能列出個詳細嘅時間表，而有關資料。

68
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,380
將會係按照我哋逐年延展嘅建屋計劃，係適時公佈同埋諮詢區議會嘅。

69
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:59,760
咁舉個例嚟講咧，就係誒，譬如我哋喺近近期就向沙田區議會係諮詢公營房屋發展項目，啊，包括係火炭第一期同埋第二期公屋啦，和尚敦嘅公屋發展啦。

70
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:13,870
石門村第二期啦，同埋馬鞍山南段同北段等等，噉我哋一起就着手去處理一啲交通同埋係社區配套設施噉樣嘅問題，最後咧都順利得到區議會嘅支持嘅。

71
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,850
咁大家我哋可以理解到就係，我哋一般嚟講咧，係藉住房委會發展公屋。

72
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,450
我哋係會積極。

73
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:41,740
同相關嘅政府部門咧，去緊密聯絡，同埋係做一個整體嘅規劃，提供足夠嘅社區設施同埋配套。例如，我哋會改善公共交通設施，理順交通問題，提供康樂設施同埋綠化空間，優化行人通道等等嘅連接，又會提供零售設施。

74
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:50,170
同埋係支持社區嘅需要等等，並會係加強社區設施配套，例如長者設施同埋社區會堂。

75
00:11:51,860 --> 00:12:09,350
為咗確保我哋有誒充足同埋係穩定嘅公屋同埋居屋嘅誒嘅供應咧，由財政司司長領導嘅土地供應督導委員會將會繼續全面統籌全港所有唔同用途嘅土地嘅開發同埋供應。

76
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:28,070
並會係調整土地供應，以係誒應對一個需求嘅變化嘅。我哋會進一步係加強政府內部嘅協調啦，同埋係跟相關嘅區議會同埋地區人士緊密聯絡，喺全港唔同嘅地區物適適合發展公營房屋嘅土地。

77
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:45,360
房委會會考慮所有合適嘅地段，無論佢地盤嘅面積大小，都會本住係地盡其用嘅宗旨，喺最具城規許同埋係可持續發展嘅原則下咧，係興建公營房屋去滿足市民對於公營房屋嗰個需求嘅。

78
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,910
房委會會積極探討各種可行方法。

79
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,400
去增加土地同人力資源，去提供同埋興建公營房屋。

80
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:02,150
我哋會盡量係利用現有土地嘅發展潛力，去確保珍貴土地咧嘅資源可以更有效噉樣運用。

81
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:18,350
房委會會繼續同相關政府部門緊密協調，喺規劃同埋基建設施許可同埋唔影響環境質素嘅大前提底下咧，盡量爭取係放寬地積比率咧，同埋係高度嘅限制。噉，主席，啊，多謝各位。

82
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:37,660
啊，多謝你，阿馮女士。而家咧就係登記咗嗰個誒發言嘅次序咧，係噉樣。我讀一讀畀大家聽：方光、梁耀忠、李卓仁、梁志祥、陳偉業、麥美娟、鍾樹根、張超雄。就誒，仲有冇人誒想報名先？

83
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:48,350
如果冇咧，就係我哋暫時就係誒有咁多同事想發言，就每人四分鐘，連問連答。請方剛議員。

84
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,790
好，誒唔該，主席。

85
00:13:51,270 --> 00:14:03,280
即係我睇個文件嗰度咧，即係附件二嗰度咧，即係講誒二零一三年一一三一四一四一五一五一六一七一六一七噉樣樣。

86
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,900
咁多年咧～

87
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,080
每年嗰個誒市區同埋擴展市區個數目咧。

88
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,740
譬如話誒一三一四咧，都有一萬四千一百個。

89
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,480
噉啊，零零四四一四一五咧，係即係市區同埋誒擴展市區咧。

90
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,940
係得六千九百個嘅啫。

91
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,150
一五一六咧，又係都有誒。

92
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,900
都要一萬七千八百個。

93
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:40,400
一六一七咧都有一萬四千一百個，就零零些些係零二零一四一五咧，係得六千九百個。

94
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,700
噉係咪嗰嗰一年嗰陣時係咪會個數目會爭咁遠咧？就呢個第一個問題。

95
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,660
第二個問題就想問問，就係話前嗰輪咗個。

96
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:03,750
嗰個審計報告嗰度都有查咧，就話嗰個誒公屋富户嗰度咧，佢就話有隱形嗰啲富户有成九萬幾個。

97
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:13,830
噉啊？唔知政府會對呢一樣嘢係咪會加緊啲咧？噉，即係我睇到啲文件咧，你又估計係每年咧有七千個可以攞得翻嘅。

98
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,570
噉係咪如果揸緊啲，係咪可以攞翻多啲咧？咁呢個第二問題。

99
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,340
第三個問題，我想問問就係喺你嗰個文件嗰度講咧。

100
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,410
誒非長者一人申請咧，係有十一萬五千六百宗嘅。

101
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:43,340
咁呢入邊咧有冇啲譬如話十八歲啊，即係啱啱中學讀完中學，譬如十八到廿二三歲嘅，嗰入邊有幾多咧咁？

102
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,350
因為如果啲大學生一出去揾嘢做咧，就會超過嗰個最低工資㗎啦。

103
00:15:50,970 --> 00:16:04,080
七，如果攞一萬蚊人工咧，佢已經係唔可以係做，即係誒有資格去申請呢一樣嘅。咁呢個數目係幾多咧？因為將來如果佢賺一萬蚊咧，佢哋嘅數字係。

104
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,680
應該係冇咁多嘅，啊唔該，主席，我就呢三個問題。係阿白小姐，係咪你答啊？

105
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:31,490
Two of them, then I'll get Ada to deal with the first one. The seven thousand units that we take back doesn't just come from well-off tenants. It comes from a whole range of different reasons. People who lose their flats because they abuse the flat, people who die, unfortunately, or move out to elderly homes. Yes, we do take some back from well-off tenants.

106
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:51,500
But there are many different reasons, so it's very difficult to say exactly what you know where the dominant reason is. Certainly, in terms of the well-off tenant programme, we are stepping up our efforts to look at, for example, the income and asset limits. We've

107
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:11,510
We've increased the number of people in the special unit team to look at their declarations, so that we can perhaps pick up more people that fall within that well-off tenant category. But I have to say it's quite a controversial issue because, you know, some well-off tenants, of course, their situation at one

108
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:27,970
particular point in time may change, so that within maybe a year or six months they they they lose their job or what have you and their circumstances change. So it's something we need to keep an eye on. But it is something we are doing. In terms of the the quota and points system applicants.

109
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,840
again.

110
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:50,130
At the moment, we we have a system of quota and points which is based on the number of years that the individual is on the waiting list and their age. We do not discriminate against age. In other words, we don't take points off. Although I can say at the public accounts committee recently there was a suggestion.

111
00:17:50,130 --> 00:18:10,140
from one of the members that we do that, but this is not something we we have taken on board just yet. Having said that, the long-term housing strategy has also recommended we look at what they call rationalising the QPS system to see if we can get rid of people who who really will never be eligible and perhaps.

112
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,760
shouldn't be on that list. Perhaps Ada can deal very briefly with the the question of the extended urban area.

113
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:36,580
間斷咧係間斷，就係話，因為由於咧，誒可供發展嘅公屋嘅土地供應分佈都不一嘅，咁同埋就係興業公司，就係規劃誒規劃啦、設計啦，同埋係建設等等各項唔同嘅因素，所以每個項目喺唔同嘅區域咧，包括係即係市區、啲近市區或者係新界咧。

114
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,730
都分佈亦都唔會係每一年都係係誒劃一或者同一個比例嘅。

115
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,880
好，誒梁耀忠議員。

116
00:18:45,260 --> 00:19:05,270
亦就誒文件上高咧，亦都正如即係房屋署以前一節都係噉樣講㗎啦，都係維持三年可以上樓噉樣樣。咁但係事實上係咪咧？噉我哋成日一對質疑緊呢個數字嘅。咁最近我啲同啲劏房啲家庭咧，一家四口等咗五年幾咧，都係即係未人派個派個樓嘅。咁咧就一個長者。

117
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:25,280
六廿二歲㗎啦，咁咧等咗五年咧都未派到單位嘅，即係依大有所大有存在嘅。噉我真係成日覺得依個三年上樓，即係你成日講平均數啦。咁但係問題在於真係你係達到幾多成嘅人咧，真係可以三三年上樓咧？意思係反而最重要嘅，就唔好成日講話即係平均數，平均數真係呃人。

118
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:43,760
嘅，邊人講過？咁依個第一點啦，有幾多成真係可以三年上到樓？而三年咧意思咧係派第一次啊，咁第二次、第三次點樣樣咧？我成日都係覺得有問題存在喺度嘅，可唔可以即係再畀一啲詳細資料畀我哋？第二個問題咧就係單身人士啦嚇，咁咧就係就算我非長者啦。

119
00:19:44,090 --> 00:20:04,100
非常者咧，就算就你哋不斷宣傳講嘅話咧，好多時咧有啲嘅即係大學生啊，或者係誒畢業生啊噉樣都排隊嘅噉樣。但係其實即係方剛頭先所講啦嚇，啲大學生出到嚟咧做一年兩年嘢嘅話咧，一定超過你個限額㗎嘛。噉佢一定入唔到嘅，就算佢排隊冇意思入佢都，所以條隊排啫。但係今

120
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,410
佢冇可能入到去嘅，所以我覺得都唔係嗰個需求問題。

121
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:27,700
即係唔會係障礙到你需求問題嘅，但問題在於好多啲三廿零歲嗰啲嘅工友咧，同我講咧，佢真係單身出嚟咗幾年工作，人工唔高，但係排咧排幾都排唔到，因為點解咧？因為用計分制嘅話咧，一有長者加入嘅話咧，就佢就褪後啲。即係依個問題一直存在，你係幫助唔到嗰班人啊，喺度喺度。

122
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:42,460
喺醜化咗嗰班單身人士，依個係另一個問題嚟嘅。噉我想問你啦，即係依一班嘅單身人士，你又點樣去畀個年期畀佢上樓咧？畀個畀個畀個嘅嘅嘅期望佢咧？因為而家個排隊係冇期望嘅。

123
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:55,420
即係有期望都好咧，到到佢啦，譬如諗住好快到佢啦，咁其實又畀人打後邊嘅，又褪後嘅，因為點解有人打到個針啊嘛？而家排個背景就係你講佢依個問題非常之嚴重嘅。咁第三個問題咧就係。

124
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:15,710
你講個建築量裏邊嚟講話咧，其實出年咧、出年同埋後年咧，佢最少嗰個建築量嘅。噉啊，依個咧就係即係你成日都講開五年，而家講長咗五年嘅噉樣樣講。咁咧就話即係三年，咁即係即係係咪即係你哋再係喺度誒，即係春天後年嗰邊嗰個嗰個排隊裏邊嚟講話咧，即係個情況係。

125
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:35,720
冇辦法改善得到咧，定係咁惡化、咁惡劣嘅咧？噉樣樣三個問題，而仲有一個，再講埋一個先。農再一個咧，就係點樣樣咧？就係其實咧，而家好多院社咧，係揾地盤咧，去起樓、起起起院社咧，係好難嘅。就算就算喺私人樓宇買地方都買唔到嘅，即係買單位都買唔到嘅。咁其實咧，我哋曾經講過咧，就係。

126
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:56,000
公共房屋裏邊咧，可唔可以興建嘅時候，即撥出一啲嘅層數咧出嚟咧，係畀遠社咁咧？依個咧就可以加快嗰個遠社咧，能夠可以係誒即誒誒完成，同埋即有機會可以提供多啲誒誒宿位畀一啲嘅誒有需要嘅遠社朋友噉樣樣。其實喺依個依個階段裏邊嚟講，你哋可唔可以？

127
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:12,000
同社會福利署嗰度咧合作一下，就即係騰出一啲嘅層份或者啲誒誒誒誒單位出嚟咧，係畀一啲嘅院舍嘅誒設立嘅噉樣。誒，阿柏少將，你儘量濃縮。

128
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:32,320
First on the three-year waiting list, I can tell you that as we've just completed an exercise. In fact, we briefed members on that at the last meeting. The figures show that about currently about fifty-two to fifty-six per cent of people get into public rental housing within the three-year time limit. That's

129
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,320
所以，的 actual current average waiting time is about 2.7 years.

130
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:57,610
But that of course means there are people who will stay on the waiting list longer. There's no way to ignore that fact, and that's what we're trying constantly to try and increase the number of units that we can produce to get them in quicker. In terms of the time, how long does it take people to get in on the second or third offer? Really.

131
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:17,620
We can't control that. That's their choice. We can make the offer, but if they choose not to accept an offer, there's not very much we can do. In terms of the quota and point system, in fact, the long-term housing strategy steering committee did recommend that we look at two things. As I said before.

132
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:37,900
taking people off that list who will never qualify and should not be on that list, and that's something we will be doing. We'll be consulting the housing authority on that. Secondly, looking at can we gradually extend the three-year waiting time also to people on that waiting list gradually, and the suggestion is it should start at 45 and 40 and then 35.

133
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,070
和所以，我們可以處理這個問題。這個議員很正確地指出，人民。

134
00:23:43,490 --> 00:24:03,500
get on the list and they gradually move up. Then older people come in, get higher points and can get in ahead of them. So this is something we will be looking at in conjunction with the housing authority. In terms of the the third the the the immediate two years in the five year plan, frankly there is no

135
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:23,510
scope for us to to change the the current production target because we're already committed to contracts the work has already started that we frankly we should all really be on the superstructure not even the foundations so within the two to three to even the fourth year it's very difficult to to increase it it's really only in that fifth year that we can perhaps

136
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:43,520
And we've done this as much as we can, bring forward some of the production, and we'll continue to do that. Finally, on using space within housing authority sites for institutions, in fact, we do work with social welfare department to come up with sites, and indeed there's a paper coming up later.

137
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:59,430
where we will be developing a social welfare site which will incorporate space for different welfare agencies. So we do already do that, and we're quite happy to work with the social welfare department if they can advise us as to what would be the best mix of of facilities.

138
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,340
就希望咧。

139
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:21,710
大家咧就真係要掌握四分鐘咧，就連問連談。如果你提得問題太多咧，根本剩翻都二三十秒，點樣答你四個問題咧？咁所以咧就嗱，我以下咧，因為仲有好多人排緊隊，即係我儘量咧就係只能夠揸緊，所以亦都希望大家合作，因為令到大家都可以公平地。

140
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:28,400
有同等嘅發問時間同埋聽到部門回應，好嘛？嚇，阿李柱恆議員。

141
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,180
其實依個依個題目咧，即係講咗好多次，但係港劇都係個數目都即係。

142
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:55,630
坦白講，都可能變唔到多啲出嚟嗰度幣，但係有冇辦法真係可以變到多啲出嚟咧？而家問題係即係因為大家睇到啱啱劏房又大火啦，咁但係屋宇署咧就根本就唔敢去執法嘅。我覺得，因為執親法嘅話咧，根本你大把人要要要無家可歸啊，直情劏房都冇得住啊，你又公。

143
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:15,640
屋嗰度又誒，即係上唔到，所以所以其實個問題係好迫切性，要去真係盡快可以即係揾到多啲嘅公屋單位出嚟，等人哋可以上到樓。噉我想問啊，除咗依一啲而家嘅依一個誒建屋量，有冇啲誒即係快啲？

144
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:35,650
呢個方法啊，譬如話有冇同市區，我成日都問市區重建局嗰啲，可唔可以攞嚟做公屋咧？嚇，有冇多啲嘅嘅嘅可能性？嗱，同埋我都知道，即係嗰陣時傾，我一路同誒柏志高講元朗誒塱邊個中轉屋嚇幾時可以收翻，幾時可以盡快起。

145
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:55,660
公屋咁嗰度又會有好多嘅單位可以出到嚟，即係揾唔揾到多啲嘅重建嘅方法，去令到有多啲公屋單位嘅供應。嗱，頭先我講兩邊係一個啦，但係其實而家我哋係咪政府而家唔再從重建咧？嚇，重建其實係其實又可當然你有個過渡嘅。

146
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:15,670
要即係誒短期安置嘅問題，但係即係以前都咁有經驗搞園區安置，搞咗好多年啊，大家都睇到即係如果啲誒有啲地方，當然我哋好唔滿意，就安重建咗之後變咗唔係誒公屋，係變咗係商用啊，或者係攞嚟做住宅。

147
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:35,680
噉，但係如果你攞翻嚟做公屋咧，其實嗰度有好大嘅發展嘅嘅嘅嘅誒潛質喺度。到底依度依方面有冇可唔可以整到多啲出嚟喺依五年裏邊啊？白志超先生。嗯，couple of things here. Yes, it is very difficult. You're absolutely right. But in fact, the the government has now

148
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,210
係。

149
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:57,500
unleashing, unlocking sites as much as we can, including the sites that you describe, vacant quarter sites, even we're looking at some vacant housing authority sites that we can bring in a bit quicker. There are a number of challenges. One is rezoning, and quite often if a site's zoned for say GIC and we want to change it, we

150
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:17,510
have to go through the process of consultation. That's quite right. The district local community wants to know how we're going to use those sites. So that does take time. We're also looking at it from a practical point of view. How can we speed up the process of construction? How can we shorten the timeframe that it takes to build? Because I think that's another element that we must look at.

151
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:37,520
In terms of redevelopment, again, we accept what you're saying. We need to look at redevelopment, but again, the constraint there is: do we have enough re-provisioning so that we can decant the people that live in there currently into local decanting accommodation? Because clearly, if we can't do that, the resistance to clearing those sites out is greater.

152
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:57,530
And the challenge with that is that we find, even when we've announced the clearance of a site, people tend to stick in the site. They don't get out early, which allows us to clear it early. So we have to give basically three years notice. And then, of course, we're in parallel trying to do all of the necessary work to get that project going forward. So you've mentioned.

153
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:06,970
mentioned Longbin, we could mention a number of other sites when we're ready and when we can consult the public, we will do so. And I can assure you that that's our intention.

154
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:16,880
但係就唔喺而家，你頭先重建嗰度，而家完全喺依度冇出現嘅，即係嗰度會係要用通常一個地方重建要幾多年嘅時間。

155
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:32,760
都可能要下一個下一個五年㗎咯，噉就哦，it it can take it can take a long time. Honestly, if I'm starting now, I mean we're talking pack ten is already into the second five-year period. That's that's the reality. We've already announced that, so it does take a long time.

156
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,520
梁志祥議員。

157
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,560
兩次議員唔喺度，就係阿陳偉業議員啦。

158
00:29:40,620 --> 00:30:00,630
多謝主席。主席，首先咧就誒早前誒房委會提咗一啲嘅建議咧，必須透呢個機會咧向處長即係表達我強烈嘅意見咧。即係就算你個公屋供應不足同埋即係嗰個供應仍然緩慢咧，唔該，你唔好向啲大學生開刀，亦都唔好向啲富户開。

159
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:20,640
去到係嘛？呢個已經係即係多年嚟嘅政策既定咧，即係你冇理由因為某啲嘅短缺、某啲政府嘅策劃上嘅失誤咧，就揾一啲過去係輪候公屋拆嘅人，或者係住緊公屋幾十年嘅人咧，即係揾佢哋做呢一個嘅，即係揾佢哋制期嘅係嘛？即係。

160
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:40,650
你政府嘅失職，特別係全朝真任權嘅錯誤，導致到呢一個問題。就算個問題加點慘都好咧，你冇理由揾一啲排緊隊嘅人揾佢哋開刀㗎嘛？係嘛？哦，學歷高嗰啲就剔除咗去做呢一個嘅即係輪後策啊，富富嗰啲住得耐嗰啲啊，取消雙倍租啦，逼佢哋就。

161
00:30:40,650 --> 00:31:00,660
唔該，你唔好諗埋呢啲噉嘅市橋啊，即係作呢喺呢度咧作個強烈嘅聲明，同埋咧即係譴責有啲人咧即係從呢一方面諗呢一個咧，即係即係諗壞腦啊，係嘛？專係做政治打手啊，幫梁振英做政治打手，犧牲市民嘅利益。嗱，主席就講到呢個嘅。

162
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:20,670
嘅房屋供應咧，就基本上大家睇到個短缺㗎啦。政府早前即係做咗個推算咧，未來嗰十年就話要四十萬、四十八萬房屋嘅。噉你家下呢度平均一年嘅供屋係萬六到嘅啫。我畀你有萬五個、萬五萬八私人樓咧，你一年平均未來嗰四年咧，都起碼爭每年爭萬。

163
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,150
萬五個單位以上。

164
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:42,440
咁呢個問題其實真係好嚴重嘅。噉我覺得政府真係要諗，餵你趕唔切起有啲乜嘢措施，中短期措施舒緩到呢個嘅房屋嘅供應都要諗㗎。你起翻呢個誒，即係臨時房屋又好，你好似嗰陣時大陸呢一個嘅即係沙士期。

165
00:31:42,440 --> 00:32:02,450
間啊，起嗰啲特快、特快臨時住屋又好，或者你畀翻啲市民喺山邊寮屋重新再蓋搭又好，你放寬啲農地畀人臨時搭嗰啲臨時屋都好。餵你政府都要諗一諗未來嗰三五年，你有冇有冇啲咩臨時措施令到市民嗰個房屋供應得以改善？第

166
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:22,460
第二個問題咧，主席就係呢一個嘅公屋調配嘅本身嘅問題。嗱，你家下睇翻咧，我都多次提出嘅就係，你家下擴展市區好大鍋嘅。你擴展市區由一三年到到一七年咧，你總數係得一萬九千個市區，你有三萬一千個。嗱，你整體都。

167
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:36,380
係唔夠㗎啦，咁但係對喺擴展市區排緊隊咧，你而家市區配屋快過擴展市區嘅，噉你等擴展市區咧啊，特別我哋新界西大部分都喺擴展市區嘅，咁等嗰班就好大鑊嘅，等極都未到。

168
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:56,670
希望處長會唔會考慮下，就係話你市區有啲新落成嘅，你畀喺你自己行政內部諗一諗，好多人喺擴展市區咧，譬如喺荃灣葵涌啊嗰啲咧，係想調去市區嘅，想轉去市區嘅，你畀呢一部分咧，可以透過某啲調遷咧，就調咗出去市區，噉就放寬咗部。

169
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:16,680
擴展市區啲公屋咧，畀輪候拆嗰啲人，即係可以輪候到。噉你每年如果畀翻三五千呢啲咧，整個嗰個嘅地域性嗰個不均衡嘅情況咧，可以得以改善。呢個行政上政府係做到嘅，亦都係令到住緊公屋嘅居民咧，特別擴展市區住咗幾十年，想搬出去搬唔到嗰啲。

170
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:36,690
你而家係基於市區嘅公屋單位增加咗咧，可以幫到佢哋。呢個係一個雙贏方案嚟嘅。唔該，簡短啊，快啲，先生。嗯，briefly， um， we when we know that there are more urban area flats coming online， we do actually open the list so people can choose to apply for urban area flats even if they've chosen.

171
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:56,700
Extended urban and we've already done that. We announced that last year. In terms of the various measures, let me make two things very very clear. The idea of giving additional points to students did not come from the government. It was raised in the Public Accounts Committee by a member of the Public Accounts Committee. At the time, I said we.

172
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:16,710
prepared to look at any suggestions, but it's not something that we have currently put on our agenda. But we will look at it. So I think we need to bear in mind this is just one of a number of ideas that have been raised. Secondly, in terms of the the target, issues relating to temporary or interim.

173
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:34,440
housing，你 mention SARS，那係 fine， for a very short period。你 can always convert something like holiday homes into these。但係作為一個永久的解決方案，你必須提供永久的housing， and that's why we really must get additional land to provide additional housing。 Mr. Chairman， thank you。阿梁志祥議員。

174
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,370
哦，多謝主席。咁咧就嗯。

175
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,260
而家咧，即係睇翻誒嗰個。

176
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,150
誒建屋量咧，其實就同。

177
00:34:47,430 --> 00:35:07,440
我哋個見到目標咧，就即係相距十萬九千里啦。當然你可能去到五年後咧，先至開始收到啲地啊，做緊啲其他嘅發展，即係嘅先至揾到啲屋地方嚟起屋。不過咧，即係按照你呢個噉嘅誒現有呢五年嘅目標咧，就真係杯水杯水車薪，根本就～

178
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:17,080
誒而家大家諗住上公屋嘅人咧，就望穿秋水嚇。噉我收到咧近期咧，就真係好多好多咧，即係剛結婚。

179
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,650
嘅年輕夫婦咧，佢申請公屋。

180
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:41,110
而家咧想要啦，根本出邊啊租，租屋啊租唔掂，太貴。咁呢種情況下咧，似乎咧，即係我睇你嘅進度咧，即係相當艱苦嘅。噉啊特別咧就誒，即係一啲剛才阿長你講啦，有擴展居同埋市區都相當相當少嘅單位。噉啊點樣應？

181
00:35:41,110 --> 00:36:01,120
應付即係未，即係我哋誒而家嘅需求咧，唔好話未來嘅需求，而家嘅需求點樣去應付咧？噉啊，廿三萬嘅輪候差亦都係相當之令人擔心嘅事。噉啊，呢一個係一個啊，呢一個係一個炸彈嚟啊！呢個炸彈一爆出嚟咧，我相信係政府嘅管治咧更加係困難。

182
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,520
重重，即係我想了解一下咧，其實。

183
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:11,710
誒喺呢一個誒建，即係公屋個建屋嗰度咧，其實。

184
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:20,820
你哋係咪真係需要五年先至真係可以包括誒揾到地方，甚至係起樓咧？

185
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:36,150
啊，目前又會唔會碰到一啲好大嘅困難？包括咧，誒人手短缺嚇，我都聽到話有人手短缺嘅狀況。咁呢啲人手短缺咧，又喺呢個時候咧，係咪影響咗你哋？

186
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,190
啊！建公屋嘅主要原因咧？

187
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,400
仲有一個。

188
00:36:41,680 --> 00:37:01,690
你哋揾到呢啲誒，包括呢啲地盤啦，包括誒誒，即係新界誒誒，港九十八區啦，誒係咪真係好多議會反對你哋咧？造成你哋喺現有呢五年內起樓起得咁慢，個數量咁少咧？唔該，主席。阿白小姐生。Thank you, Mr. I ask Ada to describe.

189
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:21,700
Our process, because I think that'll help members to understand. In terms of the the two questions of opposition, it is difficult, honestly, at the district level in some districts to get support for our projects, and we now spend a lot more time than we would have done even two years ago. But I have to say, I think it's it's entirely understandable.

190
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:41,710
It's certainly not something that we're concerned about. We must have this dialogue with the district council and local community so that we can explain what we're trying to do, and more importantly, listen to what members want. So that process is very important, and I think we understand that. In terms of the manpower requirements, manpower is tight both within the industry generally.

191
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:54,400
and within the department, but frankly that's not the biggest issue in terms of our ability to take forward projects. It's the securing of the sites and getting agreement to allow us to take it forward. Perhaps Ada can take us through the process.

192
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,160
阿馮瑞希，嚇。

193
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:16,500
可以睇翻就係公營房屋咧，一般嚟講以前我哋話要需要七年嘅時間，包括係籌劃啦、進行各類嘅可行性研究、誒技術嘅評估同埋研究啦，同埋就係誒計劃設計工程等等嗰啲誒前端嘅工作，誒攞到規劃嗰個誒認可。

194
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,740
啦，等等，咁嗰個需要時間，跟住就去去到就係啊。

195
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,530
就設計之後咧，就到投標同埋施工階段。

196
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:45,820
咁喺施工階段咧，我哋就嗰個時間就不能扣減。例如係地基約一年啦，跟住就上蓋大概兩年半到。咁之前前端就係投標等等，就二半年到。我哋現在之前咧就係盡量將頭三年嘅工作將就壓縮為一年，甚至短過一年咧去處理，全部係同步。

197
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:53,200
係平排式並進，噉佢將個時間壓壓縮，咁所以就話咧，現在其實可一般嚟講咧，誒。

198
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,550
四年半咧，係我哋嘅極限嚟嘅。

199
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:11,210
咁現在一七一八年嗰啲咧，正正就係有一啲係需要係只可以得四年半時間咧去處理同埋完成嘅，咁所以答翻議員嘅議議，我提問者呢個時間已經係一個係最縮短嘅時間。真係嘅。啊，美娟議員。

200
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:32,270
主席，誒，剛才啊，秘書長可能即係講咗幾次，都係話我哋要揾多啲嘅地起多啲嘅屋去解決呢個問題。噉我哋知道最近咧，誒，政府就好似有呢個消息，就喺唔同嘅屋村隔離。我哋講插針樓啦嚇。噉，但係我我相信你哋梗係唔係講呢啲插針樓，可能係講緊屋村附近或者即係啲細嘅。

201
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:52,280
範圍裏邊啲地盤裏邊起啲小型嘅公屋，但係我想話咧，即係嗱，當然我哋都係希望可以有多啲地盡其用，可以多啲嘅房屋供應畀誒我哋嘅居民。頭先講嘅無論年青嘅或者係誒等緊上樓嘅劏房户又好咧，其實多啲樓對佢哋係好處。但係點樣令到呢啲計劃？

202
00:39:52,280 --> 00:40:12,290
咧係得到誒嗰個對地區嘅居民嘅同意，或者呢啲所謂嘅插針樓，唔係真係咁插針咁插落去咧。誒嗰啲到嗰個地區交通啊，或者其他嘅配套設施咧，我希望咧即係畀司長你哋部門咧去建議嘅時候咧，都要一並噉啊考慮，甚至可能咧要畀。

203
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:27,950
誒以前呢個地區冇嘅誒嘅設施，佢哋咧應該畀埋佢哋先，咁先能夠令到嗰度嘅居民咧係容易都去接受，咁先至可以真係可以好似你剛才經常提嘅揾多啲地起多啲樓呢個問題。

204
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:41,720
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, in fact, let me clarify that the suggestion for infill sites, which I think you're talking about, came from the long-term long-term housing strategy steering committee.

205
00:40:42,090 --> 00:41:02,100
I must say that it's not something new. We have been doing this for many years. It's something that we've we've constantly look at to see whether we can optimise the value and use of all of our sites. But you're absolutely right. I think we've got to balance the facilities that people enjoy, the facilities that people need. And we we heard a comment earlier about

206
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:22,110
more facilities for institutions and organisations against the need for additional housing for this this category. So that's that's part of our objective. When we when we look at sites, we'd always look at this mix. And honestly, now, as I said before, we have to consult the district council. We have to listen to the local community. We can't.

207
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:42,120
不能只 push 這些 things 順頭，所以那 process is much more complicated。 But I take the point。主席，我想講就頭先特別司長講呢樣嘢唔係新嘅，即係你不嬲都做緊。但係點解話特別提出呢樣嘢咧？就因為你不嬲做緊嘅時候咧，喺好多唔同嘅屋邨咧，你每一次提出嚟嘅時候咧都唔係好完善嘅計劃，所以政府就成日覺得。

208
00:41:42,120 --> 00:42:02,130
咧喺區議會度啊，或者地區上面有好多嘅反對聲音，結果好多嘅計劃可能係shelve咗啊，或者係拖咗好多年先做到。所以我諗而家大家市民都其實睇到住屋嘅問題咁迫切啦，我亦都唔想你再係即係將一啲計劃要拖咁耐，或者係擱置嘅。所以就想話誒建議畀政府。

209
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:22,140
就係請你哋吸取經驗，即係喺誒以前一啲失敗嘅經驗咧，咁先至可以令到你哋提出嚟嘅計劃咧，係可以得到地區居民嘅支持。正如我講，即係佢你唔係淨係畀新嘅屋邨或者新嘅嗰幾座樓嘅設施，甚至都要考慮埋喺嗰個新嘅地盤附近一啲現有嘅屋。

210
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,920
串佢哋一路都要求緊嘅一啲社區或者民康嘅設施咯。

211
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:46,450
主席，我問阿Ada to comment on this，因為在事實上，這個過程並不是給人一個最終的產品。我們在很早的時候就開始讓他們參與，這樣他們可以影響結果。這是一個有意識的策略，但或許Ada可以解釋得更清楚一些。主席，其實在一般情況下，我們在興建地產的時候。

212
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:57,560
咧，我哋喺規劃過程中一定就係會包括埋地區嘅諮詢，即係同地區人士咧、區議員咧就商討嗰一區有啲咩係設施係需要嘅咧。

213
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,910
然後咧，我哋先一齊着手就去發展嗰個公屋。

214
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:22,200
咁不過，大家都要理解就係咧，我哋發展區嘅同時，有一啲都係有有啲限制。例如有啲社區，如果話我哋係唔想要屋嘅咧，咁嗰啲我就當然就係唔可以接受啦。但係如果唔係嘅話咧，如果係我哋喺合理範圍許可之下，包括係一啲係誒地區配套嘅設施，甚至係一啲行人過路設施，例如係天橋。

215
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:42,210
啊，等等嘅咧，我哋都會一拼去發展埋，咁都希望有啲係可能係公園等等，就希望咧幫手就活化嗰區，同埋帶帶嚟嗰區有啲新嘅活力同埋新嘅動力，亦都係唔會令到嗰區嘅包括環境啦、空氣流通啦等等咧、景觀咧，就有一個負面影響。噉我哋就一定就希望喺最短。

216
00:43:42,210 --> 00:44:02,220
時間，所以頭先話極速係四年半咧，就包括埋呢啲地區諮詢，同時國內嘅誒技術研究一拼同時考慮，咁同時係要花更加多、更加大嘅誒力度或者努力咧，先可以克服各種嘅困難啦，包括係技術層面或者係社會嘅需求等等，噉。

217
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:13,590
請議員都放心，我哋一定係同個個團隊仔一定係做到息利附，務求達到呢一個係雙贏方案。地區可以有佢一個改善嘅設施，我哋要比較多一啲公屋。

218
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:26,130
與此同時咧，亦都為個區帶嚟一啲新嘅活力嘅，都係意。松樹根遠，主席，誒，我最近有個個案咧，三人嘅申請咧，市區咧，由零八年到而家都未上樓。

219
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:43,380
基本上咧，你先前話有百分之五十咧可以達到呢個三年上樓咧，我覺得依個其實都唔係真確嘅，因為如果你減咗一啲特快啊，或者嗰啲 populat 喚歡迎咧，其實你一半都冇。如果你嚟嗰兩年咧，未來嗰兩年咧，嗰個建屋量又減少咧。

220
00:44:43,660 --> 00:45:03,670
你依個係確實一個問題，即係你政府有責任要話畀我哋聽，你用咩時間去追翻三年可以上樓？而所謂三年上樓咧，應該係百分之八十嘅人可以三年上樓咧，你先嘅其實係叫做合格。你諗下，一一半上唔到樓嘅，你你點能夠話你合格咧？係咪啊？即係三年。

221
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:17,090
講唔到切實樓噉，我覺得係咪即係政府係需要去做翻呢個計劃出嚟，話畀我哋聽你點樣追？第二咧，我覺得咧，而家嚟嚟去個問題咧，都係你哋啲官個問題，係你哋個頭腦嘅問題。

222
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:37,380
即係建屋點要等四年幾五年嘅啫？呢個呢樣嘢，你而且你啲房屋大部分都係差唔多一個一個模式噉樣去吸落去嘅啫。即係改少少個積就就可以上馬啦。我立法會大樓都唔使咁耐啦，政府總部都唔使要咁耐啦。即係舉一個例，你哋好浪費土地。

223
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:37,900
係㗎。

224
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:56,310
誒下一個疫情講嘅壽命度咧，你如果睇翻個圖，你真係知㗎啦。如果噉嘅圖咧，如果畀私人做咧，起碼起三兩棟至三棟公誒住宅大廈，你有乜嚟起一棟就獨立一棟？起社區會堂得兩層，又社區會堂一個露天嘅巴士站，喂。

225
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:16,610
南灣半島噉樣等你咧，真係水都冇得食啦！噉樣點搞啊？係嘛？即係你應該就起兩三棟公屋咧，樓下係咪兩大層做曬社區會堂咯？仲大過你而家依個社區會堂都得啦？係嘛？噉你上邊咪起住宅咯？而家傻好多屋都係咁㗎啦，點解你要要即係要獨立式咧？

226
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:23,010
你你浪費土地，而家又話冇地方起屋，你又浪費佢土地，點解唔可以留誒地下係巴士總站咧？

227
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:43,640
喺南灣半島啊，起碼都七樓以上先係真真正係住宅啦。而家又咪做唔到，即係你就算個高度有限制啊，你起兩棟啊，總比你起一棟咧係著數㗎嘛。我我我覺得呢個係咩問題咧？係你哋思想問題咯。你唔改變呢個思想，做唔到㗎。噉你而家點咧？成

228
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,640
成個市區、港島區，依一年咧只得二百個單位，夾硬揾柴灣工業大廈去去起。

229
00:46:49,920 --> 00:47:09,930
咁排市區嘅排港島區嘅點排咧？二百個啊，主席。噉我睇下你你點答啦？你點樣可以加快啦？啊，謝主席。嗯，Mr Chairman，In fact, the the figures that we produce on the average waiting time have recently been the subject of a public accounts committee investigation. The director of audit didn't challenge the figures.

230
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:30,180
In fact, he confirmed that those figures speak for themselves. The three-year waiting time that we talk about, the average waiting time, that's what we achieve. And in fact, it's 2.7 years. The fact is, of course, it is an average. So there are people who don't meet that three-year waiting time. That's a fact, and I accept that. So I'm not disagreeing with you, but I have to say, the

231
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:41,040
The way it's calculated is is rational given the system. In terms of our our production timetable, I have to say that we build as fast as anybody.

232
00:47:41,670 --> 00:48:01,680
doesn't matter whether you're talking private sector or anyone else, the the housing authority's construction time is the same as everybody else's. What is different is that we get sites that have not already been formed, zoned and planned. We have to do that work ourselves quite often, and that's what takes the time. But if you give us the same site,

233
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:19,560
As you would give a private sector, we'd probably build it quicker because we do use standard approach. We do use a large proportion of the construction as being prefabrication built off site, so it's just slotted in. We're very efficient. Perhaps Ada can deal with the the other points in terms of the comparison with the private sector.

234
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:41,160
噉我哋講翻就係嗰個係簡短咯喎，噉樣出圖咧，我哋係每我哋每一層，我哋我哋呢個誒時間咧就時間，比如用一個係四廿層高嘅大廈嚟到去一做一個比較。咁一般嚟講咧，就六天就起一層。咁當然呢就係標準樓層誒天面，同埋係下邊嗰啲樓層就唔係一樣嘅。

235
00:48:41,160 --> 00:49:01,170
而地線橋、電纜橋咧，我哋一定會係按照一個我哋係合情合理同埋規劃容限最高嗰一個發展限度咧去發展嘅。當然高度限制等等咧，我做好多研究，就係謀求咧將一啲係本來係不可行、發係不可能發展嘅土地咧，都再將佢試用土。

236
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,500
地，例如規劃用途等等，多謝主席。張志雄議員。

237
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,810
多謝主席。

238
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,510
就我哋要建屋樑咧，事實上。

239
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,980
嗯。

240
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:17,180
根本係冇辦法追得上我需求，以我哋而家嗰個進展。

241
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:24,130
咁而家個文件顯示咧，其實我哋未來呢五年咧，仲要下調咗。

242
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,810
公營房屋個量咧，二千幾個。

243
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:38,810
噉我真係覺得好奇啦，主席，我哋呢個特首梁振英就以我哋嗰個房屋做為重中之重。

244
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:50,150
咁但係喺佢任內咧，我哋公營房屋即係本來都係即係預測有至少有八萬二千幾個啊，而家仲要下調。

245
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,360
咁即係當然個數目就唔係好嚴重，即係我哋講緊。

246
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:10,250
誒二千零個單位，但係二千零個單位真係好緊要，即係點點解有啲噉嘅誒房屋發展計劃話，譬如區議會反對噉，噉你又唔上馬噉樣？

247
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,080
即係點可以噉嘅咧？

248
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:20,430
嗱，啱啱我哋即係劏房又火警啦，我相信呢啲噉嘅慘劇咧，都不斷會發生。

249
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:33,060
其實我哋過去十年咧，主席，我哋嗰個公營房屋嘅落成量咧，每年得嗰萬五個，而家繼續都係行翻呢一個噉嘅步伐，但係相對於我哋。

250
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,520
回歸咗最初期咧。

251
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:45,790
我哋九八至二零零二年咧，我哋每年嘅落成量咧係去到六去到五萬個。主席，我相信你都記得啊！

252
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:52,550
喺回歸前咧，我哋講一八八至九七年咧，個公營房屋落成量都有四萬個。

253
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,490
但係而家我哋跌到萬五，繼續維持萬五。

254
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:02,420
根本就冇辦法係供不應求，你見到個排隊嘅情況越嚟越嚴重。

255
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:13,360
而家呢啲居住環境惡劣嘅情況，又引起好多火燭啊！誒，危險、衞生惡劣嘅情況。

256
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,890
我想問政府即係或者房屋處、房屋局，你有咩符咧？

257
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:38,130
嗱，我哋見到有一啲嘅學者啊，劉國裕教授咧，佢就覺得其中一樣嘢可以考慮。我就唔知政府點樣回應。而家嚟緊都會有一啲誒樓齡四十年或者以上嘅屋邨咧，係會陸陸續續重建嘅。

258
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,640
咁宣佈咗重建，以致到佢清拆咧，都有一段時間嘅喎。

259
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,280
咁其實宣佈重建之後咧，已經陸續會有啲單位係搬出㗎啦。

260
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,660
譬如白田。

261
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:59,740
重建宣佈咗之後咧，佢誒嗰四座咧已經有成五百個單位空置咗，但係佢嚟嘅清拆咧仲有可能兩誒年幾兩年。

262
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:20,420
咁呢啲時間，你係咪可以愛佢嚟做一個簡單嘅臨時嘅中轉房屋？甚至有啲咧係，譬如你第二期嗰個改誒重建咧，係講緊五年後，即係二零一八，二零一八你先去拆佢，但係而家已經陸陸續續咧，我哋所知咧，由今年嘅二月嗰度已經。

263
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:35,540
係空置咗成百個單位，一路繼續會空置。呢啲單位係會空置五年嘅。主席留啲時間畀佢答喎。我想問誒誒局長或者常秘，你哋有冇咩諗法？係點樣樣盡量用到你哋而家嘅單位？

264
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:55,830
啊，白先生簡短。Mr. Chairman, as far as the public rental housing figures are concerned, I think Annex One is the one that we should be talking about. The figures over the next five years, eighty-one thousand six hundred. That's the actual delivery that we're talking about. We haven't reduced the numbers at all on public rental housing. What we have done is we've had to adjust the the delivery on the

265
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:15,840
Homeownership scheme and that will be put back into the second part of the following year. Whereas originally there would have been around four thousand, it's now two thousand two hundred plus then four thousand two hundred in the next year. So the figures are there and they're in Annex One and Annex Two of the paper. In terms of Professor Lau's idea, in fact, I.

266
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,010
我有講過他。

267
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:38,390
There is there are a number of issues here. One is, once we've cleared part of the site for for the purposes of eventually demolishing the site, the last thing I want to do is put people in that we then have to relocate again, because it does not make sense. We already have a problem finding sufficient decanting accommodation for those people who are already there.

268
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:58,400
If we're going to add to that decanting problem, and it would be a problem because there's no guarantee someone would move out, then that makes the completion of the redevelopment process even more difficult. So I'm not convinced that that's a solution to our problem, even in the short term. And indeed, as you said yourself, we're talking maybe a few hundred units.

269
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,330
誒誒。

270
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:14,600
It seems to me that it's far better for us to focus on getting the redevelopment as quickly and as efficiently as we can, so that there are no delays. Because on redevelopment, we get a few thousand units back. That's what we should be going for. For bigger picture. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

271
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,740
誒，郭嘉其源，主席。

272
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,550
有時同政府傾都好難，因為咧。

273
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:33,850
即係擘大眼講大話。我哋有二十超過二十二萬人喺度等緊，噉佢就三年上樓。噉我哋計由你拎出嚟嘅文件，一三年去到。

274
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,070
一六年三年啦，咁咧總共係四萬六千個單位。

275
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:46,340
四萬六千個單位係可以令到二十二萬嘅人咧，係三年上樓，我都係真係希望係得嘅。

276
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:53,920
不過我諗冇法子啦，因為政府一路都係將呢個三年咧寫落去，無論係即係幾唔真實都寫落去。

277
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:12,290
咁咧就有一樣嘢，我都想問翻誒處長嘅，幾時可以令到政府有一個做法，係可以將一個人嘅學歷咧係當作為一個扣分嘅一個一個原因咧嚇？即係呢個都幾有趣嘅。幾時香港發展到一個地方，將學歷？

278
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:29,080
因為我哋從來知道咧，公屋係睇收入嘅啫，呢個係佢最重要個標準。當然佢個家庭嗰個人數啊，同埋佢嗰個住户嘅情況啦嚇。咁但係咧，將個學歷作為一個誒一個扣分嘅制度咧，我都想睇下個根據。

279
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:33,350
咁有一個咧，我就想問，因為呢啲都冇用啊，你答唔到。

280
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:53,690
就係咧，有關於嗰啲將嗰啲誒房屋咧係移前嘅，因為我留意到咧，就係譬如舉個例啦，你一六一七年同埋一五一六年咧都係安達臣嘅地盤，其實啲區咧都係好相似D E同埋A B同埋C一嘅區。政府點解唔可以將誒？

281
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:04,770
舉個例，一六一七年嘅安達臣個計劃咧係二二前一五一六，呢個個最主要原因係啲乜嘢嘢？有政府其實都講咗咧，就話喺一。

282
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:25,180
六一七一八年之後嗰十年嘅土地咧，而家揾緊，亦都有信心攞到。如果你可以將啲計劃每到預前一年啊，即係我都我相信你要要你做多，你都你都一定係講曬唔得㗎啦。咁都已經係每年咧都可能多咗大概接近兩萬嘅單位嘅。點解呢個做唔到？

283
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:30,970
最後一個咧，主席就係有關於個居屋嘅。我睇到一七一八咧，一六一七啲居屋咧。

284
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,620
嗰啲都係極之少同埋好偏遠嘅地區。

285
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:55,170
噉啊，全部都冇係喺市區，即係比較少咧。尤其一七一八咧，都係比較少，都係冇喺市區或者係擴展市區嗰度。政府有冇喺呢一度都係誒，盡量揾一啲地咧？因為我睇到咧，嗰啲居屋嘅不但止個單位少啦，亦都個個地區咧好多都係極之偏遠啦，即係。

286
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:06,630
譬如舉個例，一七一八年啊噉，噉係咪應該多啲選擇？有啲市區嘅選擇，令到啲誒市民到時可以選購啊。白小姐，稍等。Um, Mr. Chairman, thank you. We don't lie.

287
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:21,850
The second point is the education attainment idea came from a member of the Public Accounts Committee. I've explained that's something that we have no plans to do, but we will look at it since it was a recommendation that came out of the Public Accounts Committee.

288
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:42,200
It's not for us to introduce that sort of thing. I think it's for the housing authority to consider all the factors as to consider which ways to go forward. In terms of the Anderson Road, I'll leave that to Ada. In terms of trying to speed up the process and find sites in the urban area, as we said earlier, we.

289
00:57:42,200 --> 00:58:02,210
take sites as they come available. We're always pushing to find sites, both in the urban area and extended and new territories. But you don't get the sites on an on an even basis in all districts at all times. They come at different times because they're subject to different constraints. So we take them, we put them into the programme as and when they're available, and we take them forward. So

290
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:22,220
We'll we'll continue to look for sites all over the place, not just in the urban area. Ada, why don't you talk about Anderson? On land, Anderson. Hi, Anderson.到咧，現在我哋啱就攞咗塊地盤翻嚟，就開始施工嘅。因為佢一定要係講佢地盤平整，做完個平整工程之後咧，我哋先可以開始建築上蓋。咁所以咧。

291
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:33,350
如果係可以盡快去施工嘅話咧，我哋一定就唔會怠慢。咁所以就呢個就係我哋已經係盡盡最快嘅時間去興公屋，所以嗰年有咁多嘅產量者喺屯門嗰度出現。

292
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,810
風險機遇。

293
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:55,130
誒主席有幾個問題想問嘅就係誒。第一，我都想睇啲居屋就係文件嘅第七段咧，即係講居者為屋計劃同嗰個誒附件一個表啊。噉你睇到咧就係佢提過咧就係話誒一六一七咧就係二千二百個啦。咁跟住一六到二零咧就有一萬七千個啦。你睇嗰個表咧就係只係畀到兩。

294
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:02,330
兩年嘅計劃，我哋咧就一六一七同埋一七一八，咁嗰兩年咧就係六千三嘅，咁即係換一句話咧，如果係誒。

295
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:22,620
大概一年咧就係三千一啦，咁即係嗰時我哋提話希望一年有五千嘅，呢個就未夠數啦。第二就剩翻嗰大概一萬個到咧，咁呢度冇嘅。咁究竟嗰萬個係咪因為直情冇地咧？如果冇地嘅話咧，咁咪一九二零嗰啲就就就點點處理都係畀到我哋。

296
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:42,630
有信心，你真係喺度喺度唔蝕咧？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題，我以前一路都提嘅，不過而家咧就好似有，我唔知叫改善定係不改善啦。就以前咧話，我曾經提過就係誒，你六十五個percent嘅即係過未來嗰五年，六十五個percent嘅公屋咧都喺市區，其實反映咗咧五年之前咧係完全唔處理一啲。

297
00:59:42,630 --> 01:00:02,640
擴展市區用新界地去興建公屋，導致到今時今日係嗰啲地方冇嘅。咁呢個有冇一個計劃可以清楚寫到畀我哋睇？即係由而家開始啊，即係由舊年開始，我睇佢係兩三年㗎啦。誒，你已經有呢個計劃誒部署緊向市區誒擴展市區同埋市誒新界咧，係會逐步。

298
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,330
增加興建公屋嘅土地咧，噉。

299
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:25,620
第我呢啲問題嘅簡簡問簡答嘅。第三個問題咧就喺附件一嘅誒二零一七二零一八嗰度講深水埗咧有兩塊土地咧，其實都係我想問問嗰土地唔係一塊土地就係講係副食市場批發用地嘅喺現在副食副食品市場嘅咁嗰個轉用轉用途咧係咪已經一定一定掂嘅咧？得嘅咧？

300
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:45,630
咁最後一個問題就喺附件二附件二咧，睇到個我有睇啲數字咧，就係同以前又係唔同啦。嗱，你睇到咧誒一人一二人單位就萬二個啦，二三人單位就萬六啦，就一歲房咧就二萬六啦，噉就係兩歲房係一萬嘅。咁呢一兩歲房通常如果冇搞錯咧，就係重建區就四人可以入去住啦，輪候就五人。

301
01:00:45,630 --> 01:01:00,540
咁呢個兩房咧係偏低咗嘅，我驚你係做數喎，即係同一個面積點可以起多啲單位咧？就起多啲小面積嘅單位，大面積嘅就唔起，或者起少啲，噉你於是乎可以供應多啲咯。咁其實個。

302
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:20,830
增加興建公屋嘅土地咧，係冇增加到。咁所以喺我嘅瞭解咧，一啲舊區誒輪候公屋，我哋其實通常都係四五六人都有，特別係四五人添。噉樣重建區咧就係我我我如果冇搞錯，四人可以兩房，新增就五人可以兩房。噉你呢個一萬個單位，究竟夠唔夠？

303
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:40,840
同咧批准，怕幾個先生？Mr Chairman, yes, I'll ask Ada to help me on a couple of these. In terms of the total production, I did say in my opening remarks that we have secured the land for the full seventeen thousand. But of course, we're just showing you the production in the first five-year period, so the others will fall into the second five-year.

304
01:01:40,840 --> 01:02:00,850
period in terms of the HOS. In terms of securing additional land, yes, we are in fact working with Development Bureau, Planning Department and Lands Department to find sites. Not in any particular area. We're trying to find them anywhere, including the extended urban and new territories.

305
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:20,860
those those sites that are offered to us, we will take forward as quickly as we possibly can. Finally, in terms of the the distribution of units from one one p two p up to two bedroom, we do have a system of annual review of the demand, the forecoming demand in the five year period.

306
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:40,870
We put this through the process so that the production figures correspond to what we anticipate to be the demand based on the waiting list. So it isn't fixed every year. But what we're doing is planning for the fifth year. So this time this year we'll be doing the next fifth year. So we do keep that under constant review, and this is.

307
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,400
係，The way it's looking at the moment.

308
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,680
馮女士，簡短啊嚇！

309
01:02:45,210 --> 01:03:05,220
係啊，咁回應翻就係我哋喺各區誒不同嘅地方都係不斷係覓地去興建公屋，即使佢每一年咧，雖然佢嗰個誒產量個分佈唔係平均，咁但係的確咧，我哋係喺全港九誒各區，如果係有適合嘅土地咧，我哋都一定會係盡量係去啊落實，同埋就係去發展公營房屋。

310
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:05,630
係。

311
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:10,860
咁至於誒一隻公方面咧，居屋方面咧，喺二零一。

312
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:22,810
六一七、一七一八嗰兩年咧，我就誒，因為因而我哋喺呢五年內嗰個產量咧，我就有提供資料。但係咧，我哋其實現在已經積極喺誒二零一。

313
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:34,570
八一九一九二零咧，有足夠土地咧，係興建總產量喺嗰年咧係一萬七千個單位嘅，多謝主席。黃旭文議員而家唔喺度，就係阿郭偉強議員。

314
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:55,030
係主席，我諗誒公屋輪候拆廿幾萬個申請咧，已經係一條好大嘅數啊。噉啊，而家政府咧好努力咁去處理，噉啊，其實起幾多都唔夠㗎啦。講真啊，除非變魔術嘅啫。咁但係始終都係要踏實去處理嘅。咁所以有呢個今日嘅建設計劃係。

315
01:03:55,030 --> 01:04:03,100
係一個第一步嘅方向，噉啊，無論點都好都要做咗先啊！千祈唔好因為議員有意見咧，就話慢咗啊點樣？

316
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:23,390
咁另外咧，我睇到誒誒局方咧，其實都強調就話用最快嘅流程，用最大嘅力度去做呢個。我相信啊，即係個方向係正確嘅。咁但係如果要我哋誒議會順立，你哋真係盡咗最大嘅努力嘅話咧，咁希望咧喺日後任何嘅計劃入邊咧。

317
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:33,300
你喺邊度慳咗時間？慳咗幾多？誒可以嘅話，逐一喺議會上咧話翻畀我哋聽，等我哋知道你係盡咗最大嘅努力。咁另外咧。

318
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:53,660
就係咧講緊嗰個誒數量啦，因為咧你嘅文件咧PowerPoint嗰度咧講得好清楚啦，二零誒由而家去到二零二二年嘅土地咧，你都揾夠啦，即係十七萬個公屋單位咧，你都揾夠土地啦。咁呢個我覺得係好事嚟嘅。咁但係講真。

319
01:04:53,660 --> 01:05:13,670
即係大家對政府嘅期望好高嘅啊！既然而家你咁輕鬆喺誒九年九年前啊，今日係一三年九年前就已經話揾到曬土地啦。咁即係嚟緊仲有空間，再揾多啲土地啦。係咪就住呢個方向可以再做多啲？等我哋市民咧，真係感受到政府係盡咗最大嘅力度。

320
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:33,680
就唔係用一般嘅力度去做噉。另外咧，頭先好多同事都提到插針公屋噉，我希望咧誒插針公屋咧真係要針對性，因為咧插針嘅地方咧本身個面個地地方好細啊。噉我希望咧呢啲插針公屋咧可以針對性地起一啲細嘅單位，畀啲單身特別係咧。

321
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,780
我哋頭先講緊一啲誒非長者嘅單身人士申請，點解咁講咧？如果佢哋係有工作嘅話，佢哋係有。

322
01:05:42,060 --> 01:06:02,070
工作需要慳翻啲車錢，慳翻啲誒搭車嘅時間。喺市區度工作嘅話咧，其實應該要幫呢班人。特別係咧，我哋工聯會都提過一份建議書，就係話有要新增一個月累公屋，其實政府自己可以做嘅，即係特別畀年青人誒貴正常嘅公屋少少，但係又唔係好貴。等呢班有。

323
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:22,080
有做嘢嘅人可以儲到錢，遲啲你買居屋又好，或者轉入私人市場都好，佢儲到錢。希望插針嗰啲公屋咧，可以多啲為年青有工作嘅人士咧，諗多少少。咁另外，最後咧就係關於嗰個誒誒，既然建屋量咁大啦，噉啊早早前咧其實財檢個。

324
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:38,970
誒唔係，應該唔係叫裁減，呢個縮減咗公務員嘅人手嘅。咁如果嚟緊公屋量誒建屋量咁大，要增加人手嘅話咧，我希望究竟政府對於起屋嗰個魄力有幾大咧？我希望能夠反映喺人手嘅增聘嗰度。多謝主席。

325
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:59,360
法務司長。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In fact, I can say that we have been looking to increase our establishment over the last two years. We have, with members' support, been able to create posts, and we will continue to do that. It's something I have to keep an eye on, and we will, in fact, be coming both this time and next time with.

326
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:19,370
on establishment increases. In terms of the infill sites, as I said before, I think this is something we will we will have to look at. But obviously, we need to bear in mind local concerns as we take this forward. In terms of flats for singletons, government has

327
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:39,380
come up with this hostel approach for young younger people, where they have a fixed duration, maybe five years. They can save up some money, as the honourable member has suggested. I think that's something that we'll we'll see how that goes. But of course, from the perspective of the housing authority, our mandate is to provide housing for those people who.

328
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:47,160
really need public housing, so that's where my focus is at the moment. But I think government's aware of the other ideas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

329
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,790
啊，接住阿梁國雄議員。

330
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,050
亮光議員。

331
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,970
拍醒佢。

332
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,120
叫聲嘅。

333
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,510
梁國雄議員到你啦。

334
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,920
梁國雄議員，你唔發問啦，係嘛？

335
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,030
啊！唔講唔講。誒，陶錦新議員。

336
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:19,600
誒，主席，誒，我我唔知道先誒，我嚟之前有冇誒答過咧？啊，你問啦，我哋都想其實確確認咧，就係係咪話真係阿柏治高先生所講咧？

337
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:39,890
就話：如果嗰啲申請人係嗰啲非長者，係嗰啲誒單身而係大學嘅背景咧，係咪真係扣分，即係減分噉樣？佢係兩次澄清咗誒，因為頭對唔住頭先咧，佢已經答咗兩次㗎啦。佢誒聲明咧，呢位帳目委員會有間討論，有委員噉樣講過。

338
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:59,900
佢哋政府咧，誒目前只係聽到呢個意見嚟考慮，佢講係考慮嘅前眼，唔係政策。唔係，我我想問佢係咪會考慮啊？誒，不如一間畀佢答。我我就想問佢會唔會考慮答？即係我我我就好驚訝咧，即係一間畀啊，拍招可以直接答。係啊，我諗佢答啦嚇，好嘛？好係咪真係會考慮啊？嚇，即係我我好似。

339
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:19,910
震驚啊！即係如果考慮，我都覺得好震驚嚇。好，阿白小姐請你打一答，先答呢個問題先。Mr. Chairman, these are ideas that have been floated by the Public Accounts Committee. I'm obliged to look at them. I can't. I have no choice in the matter. Once the idea has been floated, I have to follow up, whether or not it's something I would recommend to the Housing Authority, who has to make the final decision.

340
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:39,920
但係，我

341
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,450
我唔可以回應得到，係咪可以實施得到嘅咧？

342
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:52,010
即係嗱，我我咁諗啫。你你譬如話，如果誒我我申請公屋，噉我有誒購成，即係我嘅著入住需要啦噉。

343
01:09:52,330 --> 01:10:05,460
噉我入住需要咧，就一般嚟講就係我會誒揾唔揾到一個誒合適嘅居所，或者租到出邊市市場啊，或者我可唔可以去邊度誒自己搭間木屋啊，或者咩搭間天台屋啊？噉嘅能力啊噉。

344
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:09,670
噉啊，噉啊，照計應該人工咧，就係嗰個最客觀嘅啫。

345
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:14,050
啊，咁誒，年税咧都仲好啲。

346
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:19,980
你仲可以話喂，咁誒咁？但係如果你話佢因為讀得多書，

347
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,400
咁所以咧，佢就會係誒排後啲噉，或者少啲分噉。

348
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:35,360
即係好坦白講，你讀多書讀，你你唔係保證係有幾多收入㗎嘛？兩個係嘛？即係我我我就唔明，真係點可以客觀成為一個？

349
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,960
誒，即係理由咧噉。

350
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:45,190
係咪啊？柏志高先生就係話：今日咧就係好簡單，就係總言之就係，啊委員會講乜你就考慮。

351
01:10:45,490 --> 01:11:03,150
就但係，你唔會有自己初步嘅意見，誒，可唔可以可唔可以交流一下咧？拍照生，你答請你答。Mr. Chairman，I haven't looked at this. This is something that we have to look at. It has been suggested. But you have to look at it. Yes. But can you have some preliminary analysis on the feasibility?

352
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:12,250
Mr. Chairman, we we already have a system of deducting points from, for example, people who live in in public housing already.

353
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:32,840
我唔知我哋可唔可以採用一樣嘅方法。

354
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:42,380
唔係啊，主席啊，一係你講，一係就佢講。主席，我同你，我我同你講啦，我同你講啦。請你講下。我覺得柏子公先生咁講咧係好混帳啊！

355
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,880
nonsense。

356
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,890
即係我而家唔係叫你做一個決定。

357
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,980
我係叫你作為一個公務員，作為一個咁高級嘅A.O.

358
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,200
你至少啊，你對一樣嘢能唔能夠實踐啊？你有一啲嘅評論。

359
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,550
呢個評論都冇話唔尊重邊個委員會，又唔尊重我。你話你話得都得㗎。

360
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,850
但個問題，你話乜嘢意見都冇。

361
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:08,340
喂，記住喎！呢個已經喺社會裏邊咧醖釀咗一段時間，係好爭議性嘅。

362
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:15,850
你至少可以分析下利係乜嘢，弊係乜嘢，可以實踐係因為乜嘢，唔可以實踐係因為乜嘢。

363
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:28,020
誒，由越誒，我我會畀時間你答啊，柏超先生。誒，因為阿陶瑾真員都表達咗嘅意見，咁而家咧請你表達意見，我畀你表達意見啊，柏超先生。

364
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,300
請講。

365
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:49,590
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I think it would be totally wrong of me to give a personal opinion on something which has been recommended by members of this legislative council public accounts committee. I've explained that the normal process is we take away a suggestion, we study it, we make a recommendation to the housing authority. We will follow that process. My view is irrelevant.

366
01:12:49,590 --> 01:13:03,110
喺呢個context，真係，因為Whether我Think係 sensible or nonsensible，唔使matter， until我studied it， it would be wrong to comment。主席，我講係政府分析啊，我唔係你個人分析啊。政府係咪初步分析都冇啊？

367
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:06,410
如果你話政府初步分析都冇，咪政府冇分析咯。

368
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:11,390
嗯，Mr. Chairman，我沒做過分析，所以會是個人意見，我怕。

369
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,300
O.K.政府即係冇分析啦，即係暫時。我哋誒。

370
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:24,350
答完啦呢個問題，阿梁國雄議員到你。我就啱啱出呢個問題，因為阿柏生，我琴日先去嗰個誒房委會試個威。

371
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:35,170
誒，你個人嘅意見當然誒係誒唔緊要嘅，但係你係一個常備嚟㗎嘛。咁常備當然係誒。

372
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,320
制定政策嘅過程裏邊咧，係非常之重要嘅。

373
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,520
咁所以啊，當阿陶議員問你個意見，就係話一個人嘅。

374
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,570
學歷會唔會構成一個？

375
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,240
資格上面嘅。

376
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,690
限制嘅時候咧，你係應該答嘅。

377
01:13:55,570 --> 01:14:10,580
即係，譬如譬如啱啱咁講，讀完幼稚園嘅人就攞唔到公屋，噉你梗係答答到啦。噉你如果讀讀完大學攞唔攞公屋咧，咁如果你話佢係會構成一個扣分制嘅咧，噉我覺得你應該答嘅。我覺得我我同你講啊。

378
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,140
我覺得咧係匪夷所思。

379
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:21,230
因為你鼓勵人哋讀書，你叫人哋咧就係話誒呢一個咧係誒。

380
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:33,260
因為香港咧要誒行呢個即係誒即係以知識為本、知識為本嘅經濟噉樣，咁人哋讀書嘅時候，點解構成咗佢攞房屋嘅一個障礙？

381
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:37,210
噉我覺得你如果唔答嘅話咧，係非常之艱難。

382
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:57,630
其實老實講，如果你出親呢個噉嘅政策咧，一定係一定係私立科係你㗎啦，私立科係你一定輸緊嘅。我未聽過一個國家或一個地區咧，就係話如果你讀得書多咧，反而會構成咗一個誒，即係你去享受呢個誒。

383
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,030
福利嘅一個障礙。

384
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:06,900
冇冇可能嘅呢樣嘢，你可以定立就係話誒呢一個誒資產審查啊！

385
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,810
誒一個入息審查啊！喂哥，你咁都唔答，你真，我覺得你真係講唔通。

386
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:15,980
呢個呢個唔係你嘅個人意見。

387
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,630
誒，我覺得其實李澤個人意見都啱嘅。

388
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:21,770
因為你都係人嚟㗎嘛。

389
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,260
你你即係你就個人嚟講，你覺得噉樣係唔合適嘅咧？

390
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:32,310
我希望你真係喺度澄清下，因為咧誒，如果開咗噉嘅例嘅時候咧，好簡單，一定係set for你㗎啦。

391
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:44,020
一定係㗎啦，即係你等住都得㗎。噉你你如果你喺呢個誒立法會嘅會議上邊，你唔畀一個合適嘅意見咧，咁即是你迴避咯。

392
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:54,440
誒噉，問嗰個問題就阿阿王國王英如，你要明白一樣嘢。如果我哋今日喺度作為一個監察嘅機構，話畀佢聽，噉係唔合適嘅時候，佢話我唔知啦。

393
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,300
當嗰個政策形成咗之後咧。

394
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,850
誒，佢要負責任，我哋都要負責任個。因為我知道呢個一定係。

395
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,250
輸緊嘅根本，即係如果你打一張福，一定輸緊。

396
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:12,250
你畀時間佢答啦。阿柏照先生請答。Mr. Chairman， I I fully respect the view and of course。

397
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:32,950
The fact that members feel it's inappropriate will be taken into account when we take this this matter forward. I really don't think I can comment on something which I just don't understand the implications. For example, I'm sure there will be some legislation that might be relevant to this. Human rights legislation may be relevant. There may be other pieces.

398
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:48,310
但因為我沒有研究過，我就不知道。可能這項立法根本就沒有必要。

399
01:16:48,590 --> 01:17:04,760
自動地 disqualified or have some kind of discredit for the housing public housing project. I think it's common sense. Well, if if a government cannot deal with the common sense and then

400
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:25,050
佢哋應該被埋。阿柏小姐，你而家答埋佢。Mr. Chairman，I don't think the suggestion from members, certainly not my recollection, was that we should ban people. In fact, at the Public Accounts Committee, there was a suggestion that we should apply an age limit, and I said no. If people have a need for housing, they should be able to apply and be

401
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:38,940
考慮，和那係我嘅基本立場，和那應該適用於所有人。無論係一種歧視定唔係，你係唯一需要有啲某種。

402
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,490
時間到啦，梁議員。

403
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,120
我，

404
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:46,630
係。

405
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:49,850
時間到啦，梁院。

406
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:59,140
誒而家咧就我用我自己作為議員嘅四分鐘時間，我有兩個問題咧，就係問一問當局嘅。

407
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:16,860
第一個咧就按照當局今日交畀我哋嘅文件咧，就講如果誒頭嗰五年再跟住下嗰五年急埋咗十年嘅興建出租公屋嘅總量咧，就係十八萬二千。

408
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,510
十八萬二千。

409
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:28,990
如果係居屋嗰度咧，你就係未有個完整嘅數字嘅，即係十年。不過我算夠你每年五千，十年我當佢五萬。

410
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:37,760
我當嘅係五萬，咁計埋咧就係十年嘅建屋公營嗰部分咧，總共就係二十三萬二千。

411
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:56,690
但係長遠房屋策略，政府喺嗰個文件裡面提出咧個目標就係四十七萬，又講咧六四比六成咧係呢個公營嗰部分，即係換句説話咧。如果以四十七萬嘅六成咧，就係連公屋。

412
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:00,690
居屋加埋咧，就係二十八萬二千。

413
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,960
嘅單位總數應該係噉。

414
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:15,630
喺噉嘅情況底下咧，我哋睇到啦，即係話兩個五年計劃加埋，即係相差仲爭大概最少五萬嘅單位。

415
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:35,920
我想問一問當局：如果我哋而家已經睇到呢個未來兩個五年計劃十年加埋，就係相比於嗰個長遠房屋策略六成公營嗰部分，仲爭五萬嘅單位，噉係爭好遠。你點樣去解決呢個問題？

416
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:51,090
呢個第一個，第二個問題，我要問咧，就喺二零一七一八年度出租公嗰個部分，竟然喺新界係完全冇編配嘅單位，係零供應。

417
01:19:51,580 --> 01:20:11,030
呢個係咩問題咧？咩原因咧？因為呢個實實際上咧，真係造成咧，就係嗰個編配公嗰度咧，就係會誒相差好遠好遠。點可能喺嗰個年度喺新界完全冇出租公屋嘅供應咧？兩個問題。

418
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,270
請答。

419
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:33,280
Mr. Chairman, the figures I think we can we can discuss, but you're right, there is a shortfall in in terms of what we have already secured for public housing and HOS production, and what might be required as a result of the long-term housing strategy. I can say that government is already working.

420
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:53,290
要試圖identify the additional sites and and the community is aware of these. We're talking about new development areas. We're talking about having to build a new town at least within the time frame that we're talking about, and that will have to come from new development areas, some reclamation, some redevelopment of existing sites, which we're.

421
01:20:53,290 --> 01:21:13,300
We're also looking at all of these sources of land are being considered at the moment. So that's something that we're working on. And in due course, I fully expect the Development Bureau will will be able to explain what they're going to do on that. As far as as I'm concerned, if I have if the Housing Authority and the Housing Department has to produce

422
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:29,410
兩百八十odd千PRH和HOS，然後 of course，我 need to make sure 我 have the resources for that as well， not just the land， but the staffing， the money etc.，所以呢個係某啲嘢，我哋要非常努力去確保。喺terms of the shortfall in the new territories， perhaps Ada 可以解釋呢個。

423
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,350
由於。

424
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:51,640
就講講就係每一誒個地段咧，佢喺土地供應同埋規劃等等嗰個供應分佈都唔一樣，咁所以而個別嘅項目咧個規模同埋進度咧都會唔同，咁所以誒每一年佢分佈嘅情況喺市區、擴展市區同埋喺新界區咧都亦都唔一樣，噉我所以話就係。

425
01:21:51,640 --> 01:22:11,650
如果係有啲土地供應係可以，我哋係隨手可得嘅咧，我一定會係會盡快發展佢為公屋。咁包括係各個唔同嘅區域都係一樣嘅。咁但係就喺二零一一七一八嗰年咧，的確新界區咧正現時真係冇一啲係誒土地供應，等我哋喺嗰年有得落成。不過就係喺唔同嘅年。

426
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:31,660
年份，例如係之前嗰一年咧，譬如二零一七年咧，就有成四千七百個單位就喺屯門區落成嘅。咁所以嗰一個數量嘅產量咧，亦都係一個比較龐大嘅數目。誒，我哋就相信就係喺整體嚟講，五年內咧，就喺各個唔同嘅地區都有一定有一啲工可以發展得到。不過整體嚟講咧，誒睇得個。

427
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:51,670
分佈嚟講，新界區誒喺呢五年咧都係比較少嘅，因為只係佔係百分之十六percent到嘅啫。咁所以總體嚟講，就係喺市區同港市區咧都係屬於一個比較大嘅產量嚟嘅。都係主席，我嘅回應咧就係，如果你哋喺嚟緊呢五年咧唔設辦法係揾到嗰個足夠嘅土。

428
01:22:51,670 --> 01:23:11,680
地咧，你下一個五年，即係第二個五年計劃咧，未做就已經咧就係失敗啊！即係我覺得咧，呢個係真係好嚴重嘅嘅警號，希望你留意啦。我只係講到呢一度啦。噉啊，作為議員啦，問到呢度為止。誒，各位就呢一個議程咧，因為我哋。

429
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:18,550
超時咗好多啦，所以咧，我哋只能夠係講到呢一度。而家咧，我哋跟住咧落下一個議程。

430
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:36,810
誒，因為時間實在上冇辦法咁咧，我哋仲有兩個議程咁咧。我希望咧，大家亦都同意我咧，就係如果去到四點半，我未未完結嘅會嘅時候咧，誒畀我咧係延長多咧，係最少係十五分鐘嚇，睇下可唔可以趕得及。

431
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:57,430
下一個議程咧就係公務計劃項目B一九五S號官塘壽明道社區會堂文件咧，就係立法會C B括弧一四一一斜棟一三一四括弧零五號文件。政府當局就公務計劃項目B一九五S號官。

432
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:11,390
觀塘秀明道社區會堂提供嘅文件，仲有第二份就立法會C.B.括弧一四一一斜棟十三十四零六號文件，立法會秘書處就觀塘秀明道社區會堂已備嘅背景資料簡介。

433
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:19,690
誒歡迎，亦都交到入咗誒一些官員啦，就為咗節省時間，唔一介紹啦。

434
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:31,620
就呢一個議題咧，就其實喺今年六月三號咧，就曾經咧就討論過，就係將呢個興建社區會堂嘅項目咧提升為甲級。

435
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:50,460
委員咧就當日咧亦都討論咗相當嘅時間，就要求提供補充資料，説明從至現有秀茂坪社區中心嘅非政府機構嘅安排，同埋如何用盡呢個地盤嘅地積比率。嗱，嗰個目係補充呢部分嘅啫。

436
01:24:51,050 --> 01:25:07,340
以便提供更多社會服務，應事務委會要求咧，當局再次提交有關項目與委員會考慮。噉樣咧就誒，因為咧其實已經討論過一次，咁因此咧今日咧就係就著。

437
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:27,660
誒上一次提出就話要解決嗰個誒，從自然有呢個社區中心誒嘅非政府機構嘅安排，同埋如何儘量咧係用盡嗰個地盤嘅地積比，就係噉樣嘅啫。都焦點喺呢一度，咁因此請部門補充嘅時候咧係聚焦一啲，好嘛？

438
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:31,000
因為個時間我哋都過咗好多，係請邊位介紹？

439
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:51,340
我八條章。I'll start, and then we'll do a very quick presentation. As you mentioned, this was raised first at the three rd of June housing panel meeting, where we sought member support to upgrade the public works programme on the community hall at Selming Road to Category A. The intention is to demolish the existing Sao Mau Ping Central Estate Community Centre.

440
01:25:51,340 --> 01:26:11,350
and construct a new standard community hall at Salming Road, Gun Tong, as part of a joint development with the public housing development. It'll be a standalone structure abutting the public housing block. Project's estimated to cost 134.9 million in money of the day prices, and demolition works scheduled for commencement in.

441
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:31,360
July 2014 for completion in May of 2018 to tie in with the scheduled completion of the adjoining public housing development. In June we briefed members on the project details and today we'd like to provide supplementary information on the proposed project and respond to the various inquiries raised by members at the meeting in June. In particular, members were

442
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,270
Concerned whether the services of the NGO.

443
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:54,560
at the existing community centre would be interrupted. I can inform members that after working together with the concerned departments, that is Social Welfare and Home Affairs Department, we've reached agreement with the NGOs and they are satisfied with both the long-term and interim accommodation arrangements that we have for them in the same district. Their services will not be interrupted.

444
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:05,320
We plan to submit the proposed project to Public Works Subcommittee in January and Finance Committee in February. Ada, if I can invite you to take us through the supplementary.

445
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:13,300
多謝主席。係啊，馮女士，我簡單介紹個補充資料啦。噉就誒，今天個文件咧就係按。

446
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,270
啊！

447
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:27,040
議員嘅要求咧，我哋就會提供現時喺信和平社區中心提供嗰啲非政府機構嘅從事安排啦，同埋係有關用地嘅啲比率係咪已經係達到上限，同埋可否增加個面積嘅？

448
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:47,980
噉我哋已經係同嗰五個係誒受惠平區社區中心裏邊提供社會服務、福利誒社區服務嘅非政府機構咧，係商討，同埋亦都係達成一個協議。佢哋亦都希望繼續可以為當地嘅居民提供服務啦，亦都願意係搬遷到附近。

449
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,220
近嘅場所嘅。

450
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:58,730
噉佢哋亦都係誒願意係從事喺秀茂坪村啦，或者係柯達臣道公屋發展項目等等嘅地點，繼續為附近居民提供服務。

451
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:19,080
咁由於安達臣道公屋發展項目嘅重置場所咧，只可以稍後先至可以進駐啦。咁所以現在咧，我亦都係安排咗喺秀茂坪村裏邊有一啲係臨時場所，等係呢啲有需要嘅非政府機構係維持佢提供嘅服務，就唔會受到影響嘅。

452
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:28,260
咁呢個文件裏邊嘅附件二咧，有關嗰五個非政府機構誒個重置安排咧，就已經詳列，我就唔一一細説啦。好。

453
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:48,800
啊！跟住就非政府機構將喺二零一四年中就遷出現址，係以備以便係施誒展開嗰個拆卸工程嘅。噉我哋喺本年九月十九號諮詢咗觀塘區議會核下嘅房屋事務委員會委員，已經備悉我哋對非政府機構嘅從事。

454
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:55,340
安排啦，委員都亦都係促請我哋係早日落成興建新嘅社區會堂嘅工程嘅。

455
01:28:55,870 --> 01:29:04,210
至於喺發揮地盤嗰個發展潛力方面咧，新嘅社區會堂喺呢個綜合發展項目其中一部分嚟嘅。

456
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:18,580
其他部分包括係公屋嘅發展嘅住宅大廈啦、圖書館、自修室，同埋喺計劃中係連接秀明道同埋曉光街嘅行人天橋，連個地盤嘅發展潛力咧，可以繼續啊充分發揮嘅。

457
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:28,970
咁計劃中嘅行人天橋咧，就會以另一個公務計劃項目去申請撥款建造工程咧，將會稍後時間先至展開嘅。

458
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:49,540
新嘅社區會堂同埋係公共房屋住宅大廈喺綜合發展裏邊嗰個容許誒嘅住用地積比率咧，同埋非住用地積比率咧，噉就係四點五倍咧，同一點五倍。而建築物嘅屋頂高度限制就為主水平基準上一百五十米。

459
01:29:50,140 --> 01:30:07,490
此外，我哋仲會有其他嘅規劃上邊種嘅因素要考慮，包括係視覺影響同埋空氣流通，因為呢一個地段咧其實坐落喺本來規劃處咧係屬於一啲係非住屋用地，同埋咧係唔係啊容許起一啲係高樓層嘅大廈嘅。

460
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:17,580
除此之外咧，大家都可以見到就係呢一個項目嘅地盤狹小，而且啊，避輪嘅斜坡、巴士總站同埋秀明道咧係包圍住嘅。

461
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:20,690
呢個斜坡嘅斜度係比較大。

462
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,400
而且好高。

463
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,250
首要注會關注就係佢嗰個穩固性，佢穩定性。

464
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:40,260
所以新嘅社區會堂嘅誒裝署咧，都要附加一個套管，同埋誒唔會對斜坡附加壓力嘅地層落腳，以免影響嗰個斜坡嘅穩定性。

465
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:54,760
誒，至於巴士總站咧，佢嘅部分範圍亦都係坐落喺一個斜坡嘅頂部，而佢地基咧亦都係為咗裝柱嘅結構，所以必須係謹慎去處理，避免改動呢部分嘅巴士總站嘅。

466
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:15,950
喺現有各種限制底下咧，我已經係盡用咗嗰個用地嘅住用部分嘅發展潛力，提供有三百二十個公屋單位，而樓宇高度咧亦都係會誒興興建到咧係規劃署畀我哋嘅容許高度最高嗰個上限㗎啦。由於呢個地盤範圍係狹小。

467
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:23,330
社區會堂嗰個設計亦都係緊靠毗鄰高樓大廈，因此咧亦都冇空間再作橫向嘅發展。

468
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:35,210
咁此外，因為建築物嘅規例定明咧，住宅大廈嘅窗户同埋水平面係唔能夠被社區會堂嘅天面去阻擋啦，所以社區會堂只能係興建至兩層高。

469
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:43,820
而新嘅社區會堂嘅屋頂將會根據規劃大綱，係提供休憩用地畀公屋嘅租户係使用嘅。

470
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:49,530
因此，社區會堂嘅設計實際上已經係利用咗地盤空間同埋綜合發展嘅潛力。

471
01:31:50,420 --> 01:32:01,630
咁喺預算方面咧，就誒同我哋早前提供嘅文件一樣啦，就係按當日嘅價計算咧，呢個預計嘅工程費用將會係一億三千四百九十萬元。

472
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:14,470
推行教育方面咧，如果得到委員會嘅支持，我哋喺一月咧同埋二月分別就向立法會嘅公務小組委員會同埋財務委員會係提交有關嘅建議工程誒嘅計劃嘅。

473
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:26,140
獲撥款之後咧，工程就會喺明年二月招標，七月就開展，預計二零一八年五月係完工，去配合鄰近公屋發展項目嘅落成嘅。多謝主席。好。

474
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,190
嗯。

475
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:29,270
各位就誒。

476
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:49,560
今日咧就想提醒各位咧，就係我哋討論呢個項目，如果有直接或者間接嘅金錢利益，就請委員咧按照議事規則第八十三A條嘅規定咧，喺發言前咧披露有關利益嘅性質，亦請委員注意咧議事規則第八十四條有關在有直接。

477
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,550
金錢利益嘅情況下，表決嘅規定。

478
01:32:52,910 --> 01:33:01,580
咁咧就誒，由於咧誒，我哋上一節就討論得比較長啊，所以呢一節咧我哋都要誒。

479
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:13,890
希望大家掌握時間，因為我哋仲有個議程，所以咧就連問連答咧，誒，我想係三分鐘，好嘛？誒，而家報嘅名有梁國雄、張超雄、梁國雄議員。

480
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:22,320
噉啊！老實講，呢單嘢咧就誒啲NCO都冇乜嘢講㗎啦，因為佢係。

481
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:29,740
喺政府施捨底下先做到嘅，所以我就唔打算講。我就想問阿柏志高。

482
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,020
先生。

483
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:45,000
嗱，上一個議程咧，你就講話即係誒嗰啲大專生咧就冇歧冇被歧視嘅。阿林宇，即係唔好喺呢個議程講翻呢個題目啦。嗱，我想我想問，我想請教一樣嘢。

484
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:50,720
你哋有四大屋村、黃竹坑村、北角村、何文田村。

485
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,470
加埋呢一個誒山谷道村。

486
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:57,620
四大地盤都係變咗私營房屋。

487
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:18,470
噉你有咩有咩資格去同嗰啲大專生講就係話？議員，如果咧你偏離呢一個嘅議題咧，就我就真係唔好意思，我真係要唔畀你問呢個問題咯，因為我哋真要按議程嚟。咁唔係，我都可以，我都可以聯繫到嘅。既然間你喺呢個壽明道社區會堂嗰度，你講到天下無敵就係話，即係你盡咗好大腦。

488
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:38,480
係令到我整個社區咧唔受損害，咁跟住咧就問咗啲非政府團體咧，佢都應承咗啦。噉你喺呢一個四大屋村被呢個毀壞咗，變咗私人屋村嘅，變咗私人地嘅時候，你有冇考慮呢個問題？四大屋村嘅問題係點同呢一個社區會堂嘅興建楞得埋一？

489
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:58,490
計撚到啦，因為佢話佢盡咗佢最大嘅能力係盡最大努力，都唔係噉樣盡最大努力㗎嘛。我唔係佢又冇盡最大能力，係令到嗰四大屋邨係變咗公屋去facilitate，即係令到更多人可以享受啲嘢啊嘛。噉佢實講，何文田邨、黃竹坑邨、德國邨。請你問翻本題目。

490
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:07,100
我我問翻啦，噉你你將呢個黃竹坑村、北角村同埋呢個何文田村，以至到呢個山谷道村四大屋村。

491
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:12,910
成幾萬、成二萬個嘅公屋單位毀掉嘅時候，你有冇同嗰啲N銷講過？

492
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:16,430
即係佢點樣去誒幫助啲居民咧？

493
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:37,050
你呢個同呢個而家去去爭取，即係部門爭取要求大家同意呢個興建都冇關係。如果佢解釋到，我可能支持佢嘅；，佢解釋唔到，我就唔會支持佢嘅。我對唔住，我作為主席咧，你都誒允許我咧，我都真係要跟議席嚟做啦。唔係你話天職良心啊！如果如果佢，

494
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:57,060
解釋到我咪支持佢修明道，我修明道嗰度，我我我知唔知佢就係睇佢解唔解釋到四大屋村點解變咗廢墟啫嘛，變咗一個冧唔得埋一齊啊梁以強。唔係噉，如果你話佢唔答佢，我咪唔支持佢咯，我唔支持佢呢個撥款建議咯。唔係佢唔答你啊，你冧唔得埋一齊。

495
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,630
Cannot respond to my answer. I will not support.

496
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,350
我support your proposal。

497
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:04,870
That's very clear.

498
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,710
I think it's nonsense.

499
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:13,920
誒，我諗就即係我都允許唔到你再問呢個問題。啊，張志雄議員。

500
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:35,400
誒，多謝主席。就呢個議程，我哋上次傾過㗎啦。我哋我自己最擔心嘅就係，即係嗰幾個誒非政府機構嗰個重置嘅安排。噉我知道而家係有改善，不過我亦都知咧，呢個觀塘青年服務團咧，佢由於以往咧直接。

501
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:55,410
隸屬呢個民政嘅民政處，咁所以佢就冇一個即係所謂八十八呢個税局畀佢嘅慈善身份。咁但係佢而家搬過去誒秀平南嗰個地方咧，房署就要求佢攞咗一個八十八呢個慈善身份。

502
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:57,210
先至可以正式申請。

503
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:02,690
噉就唔係重置，就係要佢即係雖然就預咗個位畀佢，但係。

504
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:22,980
誒，佢哋有啲擔心，佢哋願意去即係進行呢個申請咁誒。但係佢個組織已經成立咗成四十年，有好多嘅歷史文獻，可能要揾翻出嚟畀税局批。個時間幾長咧？即係明年三誒六月就要搬啦。咁如果佢未能夠攞到呢個身份，

505
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:29,470
誒，佢根本就申請唔到，噉係咪即係變成佢都會變成無主孤魂咧？

506
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:41,580
其實佢而家嗰個租金咧就象徵式嘅一一蚊一個月。咁將來咧，佢呢個地方都要二千蚊一個月。佢哋都全部都係義工嚟嘅。噉佢話佢哋都會自己籌錢。

507
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,560
但係，就可唔可以有一個？

508
01:37:45,570 --> 01:38:05,580
你繼續問啦，即係直誒畀佢哋一個特別嘅考慮，就畀佢哋搬過去，誒保證佢哋有呢個重置嘅安排，而同時咧，佢哋又繼續申請呢個慈善身份，係咪可以噉樣咧？呢個第一條問題，主要係答咗呢個先。邊今日都好多個部門嚟，邊一個？

509
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:23,400
個部門可以答到張超雄議員嘅問題啊！啊，柏超生。Mr. Chairman, we're we're happy to work with the organisation. In fact, we'll work with Home Affairs to try and resolve this one, because, as you say, they've got a long history and they they provide good services. So, we'll we'll work with with Home Affairs to try and come up with a resolution that's acceptable.

510
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:43,990
即係冇問題啊嘛，因為佢佢哋就話佢哋未啊攞到身份，你哋個職員就同佢講：你未攞到身份，連申請都未得嘅。咁即係你哋係咪有一個特別嘅考慮，係保證佢有個重置，佢哋會進行呢個申請嘅？I I wouldn't I wouldn't have expected them to have any problem getting

511
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:52,810
The status as a as a charitable organisation, as the honourable member knows, it's a it's a very straightforward process. So I don't anticipate any particular problems for that.

512
01:38:53,260 --> 01:39:09,130
係我我都我唔係問緊呢樣嘢，我唔係問緊佢申請事務有冇問題。今日咧就民政事務總署嘅助理處長許國新先生都喺度，誒亦都有民政事務總處官同民政事務助理專員啊餘嘉敏。

513
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:29,420
誒女士，你哋可唔可以幫幫手咧？啊，可以嘅。唔該，主席，我亦都剛才同我哋地區嘅同事傾過咧，係佢哋會盡量去配合嚇。佢哋都知道咧，呢一個觀塘青年服務團咧，好似頭先阿張員所講嗰個背景嚇，咁喺佢哋嗰個申請嗰方面咧，即係申請呢個。

514
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:48,060
誒，税務條例第八十八章裏邊嗰個要求嘅時候咧，佢哋會盡量去配合嘅。或者我哋就會後嘅時候，我哋就再安排去見一見呢一個團體，睇下有啲咩可以提供協助咧。將議員問嘅問題咧，就係話，如果一旦要搬遷嘅時候，佢哋仲未申請到。

515
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:57,820
八八呢個身份嘅時候，就畀佢係遷搬遷咗先，繼續申請個問題好清楚，好簡單啫嘛。係啦，可唔可作呢個承諾啊？

516
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:18,110
我相信搬遷入去嗰個係變咗係房署嘅一個租金嗰個制度。阿柏志高生可唔可以作一個承諾？萬一申請唔到都可以搬去先。Mr Chairman，we'll sort it out. I can assure you they won't be made to go out on the streets or anything. We'll we'll make sure that they get in even if they haven't got the the final agreement. As long as it's

517
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:19,610
In process, it's not a problem.

518
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:40,260
即係承諾嚟㗎啦啊！一記錄在案，好可以解決，可以好誒誒。其實我仲有第二條嘅簡單啲得唔得？誒，畀多兩分鐘，唔係你簡單，好簡單嘅啫。其實呢一個嘅本身嘅設施咧係六層高嘅，主席，我相信你都清楚。咁所以佢入邊咧就有地方咧擠咗一啲嘅。

519
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:56,800
誒非政府機構喺度做服務，而個租金咧亦都相當廉宜。咁呢個我諗係歷史嘅誒遺物啦，即係以往嗰個社區中心咧有個噉樣嘅設施。咁而家咧佢做一個新型嘅社區中心咧。

520
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:02,990
就變咗六層變咗兩層，噉啊擴大咗嘅咧係咩咧？就係嗰個禮堂。

521
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:12,570
咁但係咧，呢啲提供服務嘅地方咧就大量縮減咗，所以以致佢哋要搬走啦。搬走咗之後，其實佢哋就唔會翻嚟。

522
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:32,920
咁其實我都係即係我呢個意見嚟啫。我哋唔係話阻佢去做主席，但係既然有一個噉嘅地方，你咪可以更加充分利用。其實你上面仲有啲空間。如果呢個地方係有一啲可以建設到嚇，畀非牟利機構去繼續提供服務嘅。

523
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:52,930
或者甚至引進一啲新嘅服務嘅，噉係咪可以即係更加充分利用啲空間？你嗰個禮堂頂嗰度咧，老實講，即係係咪真係要噉樣？誒，我我我唔係好明點解會六層變咗兩層啦。所以我希望提供嘅意見咧，你將來去重建呢啲嘅。

524
01:41:52,930 --> 01:42:12,080
設施咧，你係盡量去誒爭取多啲空間畀誒福利設施去去用，因為而家院舍好誒日間服務好咧，冚冷都排曬長龍。咁而家呢一個噉樣嘅嘅設計咧，我覺得就即係比較奇怪。盡用空間，邊個部門可以答啊？

525
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,150
Ada，please。

526
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:27,330
因為咧，誒，正如頭先我亦都提及，就係呢五個誒NGO，我哋已經幫佢揾咗一個地方喺上環平區裏邊咧，就係再重置翻嘅，所以佢服務咧仍然可以為翻當區嘅居民服務嘅。

527
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:44,530
咁但係咧嗰個誒設計方面咧，的確係呢個兩層高嗰個社會會堂嗰個屋頂咧，就係要用作一個休憩用地，同埋咧，因為建築物條例規定咧，住宅大廈，因為我哋跟住嗰層已經係住宅大廈個窗户咧，水平就唔可以畀佢嗰個天台。

528
01:42:44,820 --> 01:43:04,830
嘅遮擋，所以一定你向出嚟咧，就唔可以再有第二啲建築物咧喺佢面前出現嘅。因此就呢一個已經係盡用咗佢嗰個發展嘅潛力，同埋我哋亦都唔會係令到嗰區咧係有一啲所謂社會服務咧係嘅誒，水嘅服務係已經活著住會流失，就保存翻喺翻嗰區裏邊嘅。由呢個會堂邊度管理㗎？

529
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:25,460
係啦，其實張志雄議員嘅問題就係民入後喺管理上面嗰度咧，可唔可以盡用啲空間？其實民政處答呢個問題先啱。民政處或者我都講一講咧。其實而家我哋嘅社區會堂咧嗰個基本嘅設計咧，呢句亦都問嘅基本設計點樣盡用空間咧？其實答呢個問題。問我要要解釋下點解嗰個個。

530
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,700
會堂嗰個咧。

531
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:46,990
啊！主席啊，其實嗰個社工會堂嗰個設計咧，而家一般嚟講咧啊，呢個亦都係喺民政事務委員會咧，同埋喺公務小組同意咗咧，就係用一個四百五十人嘅噉。另外，佢亦都係有一啲即係多用途嘅房間。噉啊，問題呢啲多用途嘅房間咧，就唔可以咧，就畀一啲團體咧，就變咗做一個即係寫字樓啦。

532
01:43:46,990 --> 01:44:07,000
咁所以嗰個多用途間，但係如果啲團體有需要咧，佢哋係可以租或者借用咧，攞嚟做會議啦，可以安排一啲訓練班啦，嚇噉嘅噉樣噉嘅用途嘅。咁所以如果喺翻呢個社區會堂裏邊咧，再唔增加面積嘅情況之下咧，係再擠緊其他啲服務咧，就唔係好可能嘅。咁如果你話喺個區裏邊咧，

533
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:27,010
需唔需要一啲其他嘅服務咧？嗱，我哋民政處咧係持開放態度嘅，只要我哋而家現時嗰啲設施咧係冇減少嘅時候咧，咁或者就住嗰個誒啲社會其他服務嘅時候咧，或者其他社會服務嘅時候咧，可能社署嘅同事咧可以畀一畀意見嘅。唔該，主席。你哋誒留意到將誒將朱紅雨。

534
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:31,680
嗰個意見跟誒，儘量跟進好嘛？誒，而家請阿謝偉全議員。

535
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:52,160
多謝主席。噉啊，上次傾過關於呢個發展嘅時候咧，我哋就即係我都係其中一位咧，關注嗰個善用嗰個土地嗰個問題啦。咁而家政府方面就解釋過，就關於即係好多因素啦，包括旁邊嘅發展，尤其是佢旁邊嗰個公共屋邨住宅咧，嗰個發展咧導致。

536
01:44:52,160 --> 01:45:12,170
至呢個而家做呢個社區會堂咧，個高度嚟講咧，只係兩層啦。噉啊誒呢個咧，我基本上就係即係誒理解咗㗎啦。噉樣，但係咧，我頭先講一個問題咧，即係都係善用嗰個誒，即係嗰個誒社區會堂嗰度咧，其中咧。

537
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:32,180
提及嗰個會堂嘅天台嗰個部分咧，就而家做誒休憩用地啦。咁休憩用地理論上就應該係隔離屋邨，即係公共屋邨要用㗎啦。咁呢個管理就應該係房屋署啦，第一樣。噉你讓我睇頭先咧，就介紹嗰時候第八頁嗰度咧，嗰個誒切面圖。

538
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:52,190
咧就因為主席可能嗰個時間關係咧，即係先後問題，先做呢個社區誒會堂嘅設計啦。咁其後嗰個誒後邊嗰個公共房屋嗰個住宅啦噉樣。咁喺呢嗰個誒，即係我希望喺設計度考慮埋咧嗰個暢通暢達個。

539
01:45:52,190 --> 01:46:12,200
問題，因為你嗰個係休憩用地，就畀隔離嗰個公屋村嗰度睇個圖就表現唔到咧。我希望即係喺呢方面咧就留意，因為唔同嘅時間同埋管理方面，頭先係咪先澄清咧？其實可能都已經係誒誒房屋署㗎啦。噉你頭先阿張超勇議員講嘅點樣善用嗰個個地方咧？

540
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:18,790
可能呢個都造成一啲佢合作方面或者溝通方面嘅問題。唔該，主席。邊個邊位答咧？噉樣？

541
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:39,090
哦，阿姐，係啊。嗰個誒喺市嘅方面咧，我哋都會係照顧到係大家都可以暢步通行，去到個誒嗰個社區會堂啦，同埋就有天橋接駁上邊誒兩個平台。噉就另外就係誒行人都可以適當地居民可以用到嗰個誒。

542
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:59,100
社區會堂個天台就係一間用地，因為根據嗰個規劃嘅要求咧，我哋係需提供足夠優越用地嘅。咁呢個設計方面會，大家都會係照顧得到。主席，主席，我最主要佢嗰個即係住宅嗰部分啊，公屋嗰度同嗰個社區會堂嗰個連貫啊，即係嗰方面咧，希望喺個設計度都一係考慮，因為而家你。

543
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:19,110
係分開設計嚇，誒説都係幾值嘅。我哋一所謂分開設計咧，因為誒高喺公屋方面咧，我就唔需要誒提交嗰個設計個嗰個細則咧，就畀立法會噉，所以我今次就冇將佢就展示出嚟。但係個整體設計咧，我係會一並考慮，就係全部有關嘅設施。

544
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:25,900
誒邊一啲地方可以點樣去即係係互相嘅配合咧？我哋會一一定考慮嘅，都係主席。

545
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:35,360
主席，另外管理方面係咪房屋署管理啊？嗰個都係，邊一度管理啊？可唔可以答？嗰個誒平台花園係的確係房委會去管理嘅。

546
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:44,430
就係個社區會堂，就係民政署管理嚇，即係噉樣。好，誒各位就如果冇。

547
01:47:44,710 --> 01:48:03,130
人在發問咧，我哋咧就要。主席，唔好意思，係啊。如果少時間，個社區會堂嗰度咧，就誒，請講。即係過去喺誒民政處嘅社區會堂，我都提類似嘅意見咧，就係嗰個設計嗰度咧，可唔可以係多啲誒細嘅活動室？

548
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:24,180
誒頭先佢略略都講過，你問啦，你問我睇下佢可唔可以？係啦，噉就即係如果冇嘅，會唔會有機會可以改到加到咁？同埋嗰個大嗰個活動嘅禮堂咧，有冇機會可以個設計咧，可以間有可以間開幾個細嘅活動室？因為好多時就係地區上好多唔夠呢啲活動室咧，導致到嗰個。

549
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:28,370
有時一個時間咧，百幾個團體申請咧，真係打餐懵嘅。

550
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:48,680
頭先咧就佢係答過下，不過你頭先未聽到你誒部門再再介紹、再補充多一次啦。好啊，唔該，主席。嗱，基本同我哋而家新設計同埋新建造嘅社工會堂咧，裏邊咧一定係有一個咧係誒一個可以活動嘅間隔嘅。咁咧就務求咧就係話喺同嘅時間裏邊咧。

551
01:48:48,680 --> 01:49:08,690
可以有兩個團體一齊去使用噉，主要話去間到去多過兩個咧，我哋亦都諗過咧，嗰個響實際方面咧係好睏難嘅。一個包括大家音響啊，或者各方面嘅時候咧，但我哋響其他嘅房間咧，包括嗰啲多用途室裏面咧，都係有類似嘅設計嘅，即係話以往我哋一個會議室噉啊，只可以同一時間一個團體。

552
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:28,700
用咁現時咧，我哋喺最最近最近落成嘅，譬如避離街嗰個社區會堂咧，裏邊有兩個呢啲活動嘅間板嘅，即係變咗一個會議室係可以變咗做三個團體一齊使用嘅。我哋要睇翻嗰個設計嘅時候咧，睇嗰個面積，但係最基本嘅時候咧，啊一個會開一個會議室，我哋都裏邊係有一啲間隔咧，係可以令到。

553
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:48,710
佢同一時間有兩個即係團體就使用嘅，咁如果知識咧呢一個將會誒興建喺社會會堂裏邊咧，係有兩個多用途會議室嘅。咁喺呢方面咧，係比以前嚟講咧，係可以講咧新嘅設計之下咧，全部嘅誒設計咧係令到咧係可以有多一倍嘅團體去使用嘅。唔該，主席。噉啊，主席咁記錄在案啦，即係我。

554
01:49:48,710 --> 01:50:08,720
我自己嗰陣時同民政處傾咧，我話每個地區咧呢啲會堂起碼有三至四個多用途會活動室嘅。咁因為你一個唱粵曲，一個唱時代曲，一個舞蹈咁已經去曬嘅啦。我諗主席你好清楚知道，即係你一個五萬五萬人以上嘅社區咧，即係需要呢啲活動室嘅數字係好。

555
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:14,190
好龐大，就同我同你講咧，一個活動室申請時間咧係過百個團體申請嘅。

556
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:34,560
係嘛，即係好似中咗六合彩咁開心嘅抽到係噉，所以即係就算你即係多謝你呢度加多咗一個啦。咁但係整體個編制同埋個即係需求嚟講咧，係完全超乎即係呢一個嘅需呢一個嘅設計咯。至於幾多障礙，希望第日房委會如果再考慮再有新。

557
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:39,960
新嘅會堂嗰時，真係希望可以有最少有四個多用途活動室咯。唔該。

558
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:41,590
有冇補充？

559
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:52,100
冇咧就係誒各位，我哋呢一份文件咧就係要我哋委員會咧係要表達是否支持咧，係提交公務小組委員會考慮嘅。

560
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,910
係咪大家冇反對，都支持？

561
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:57,770
啊！

562
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:12,730
係議員嘅意見，我哋喺會議記錄嗰度顯示㗎啦。噉我哋咧就冇人反對，噉我哋咧就係支持呢份文件提交立法會公務小組委員會考慮。噉啊，多謝出席部門嘅官員。而家我哋去下一個議程啦。

563
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:25,490
就係建議喺房屋署開設一個偏外首長級丙級政務官嘅職位，以推行長遠房屋策略檢討提出嚟嘅措施。

564
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:30,950
立法會文件C.B.括弧一四一一斜棟一三一四零七號文件。

565
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:43,630
就係政府當局就建議在房屋署開始一個偏外首長級丙級政務官職位，以推行長遠房屋策略檢討提出嚟嘅措施，咁咧就係。

566
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:45,040
歡迎啊！

567
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:49,480
柏志高先生，你哋繼續留喺度。仲有咧，就係。

568
01:51:54,820 --> 01:52:02,600
誒黃天宇女士，運輸及房屋局副秘書長，噉就係咪白兆欣介紹文件？白兆先生。

569
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:22,890
主席，這議程項目 seek成員支持，為一個建議創立一個超額職位，即行政官員職級C，在策略部門的策略部門，從4月1日開始生效，兩年，以應付與實施建議相關的日益增加的工作量。

570
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:25,170
從《長遠住房策略評估》。

571
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:31,330
作為成員們所知，政府在本年9月開始了LTHS的審查。

572
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:41,880
The long-term housing strategy steering committee has drawn up a consultation document and carried out a three-month public consultation exercise from September of this year.

573
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:56,280
following the consultation exercise, a report summarising the views collected will be prepared by the steering committee for submission to the government in consideration and formulation of the long-term housing strategy and relevant policy measures.

574
01:52:56,710 --> 01:53:05,050
目前，策略division，已設立一個長期居屋策略分部，提供秘書處支援給策劃委員會。

575
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:14,090
When the subdivision was set up in September of 2012, a supernumerary assistant director post was created for six months to head the subdivision.

576
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:34,380
following the lapse of the post in March of this year, as a stopgap arrangement, the existing principal assistant secretary housing policy support assistant director policy support was asked to take on the additional duties to provide support to the steering committee in its deliberations and the subsequent arrangements relating to the public.

577
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:38,770
consultation consultation exercise on a temporary basis.

578
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:47,680
following the receipt of the consultation report, government will formulate the long-term housing strategy, taking into account all of the views received.

579
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,900
這工作。

580
01:53:49,220 --> 01:54:02,090
和後續任務，將會由交通及房屋局協調，以啟動相關政策審視，和繪製實施框架，就措施的實施作出安排。

581
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:18,140
as seen from the very divergent views received during the public consultation period, and on a wide range of issues, the related policy reviews will unfortunately be complex, involving controversial issues on which the government needs to strike a careful balance.

582
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:25,780
In order to make progress on the new policy, it's inevitable that further consultation with stakeholders in the wider community will be necessary.

583
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:46,100
to ensure that these important tasks can be carried out efficiently and effectively, there is a need to have in place a dedicated team, headed by an officer with appropriate experience and seniority, to perform the duties on a full-time basis. Now, we have carefully considered whether there are other alternatives, but have come to the conclusion that extending the stop.

584
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:49,460
安排，置，到，吸收， for， the。

585
01:54:49,760 --> 01:55:01,590
Permanent Assistant Secretary Policy Support to absorb the additional work involved is simply not sustainable, given both the vast amount of work involved and his existing duties.

586
01:55:01,870 --> 01:55:15,100
asking other assistant directors in the housing department to absorb or share these duties is also not viable, as all of them are already fully stretched, do not have spare capacity to take on this substantial and substantive task.

587
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:26,740
所以，我 seeking members' support for the creation of the proposed supernumerary staff grade C post for two years to undertake the relevant works arising from the LTHS review. 謝謝，Mr. Chairman.

588
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:37,260
誒頭先咧，我已經咧係誒得到大家同意咧，係延長法定時間十五分鐘。咁而家咧就誒。

589
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:45,280
就呢個議題，每人連問連答三分鐘啦，好嘛？而家舉嘅手有張志紅，就冇邊幾位係借。

590
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:48,830
謝偉全、陳偉業嚇三位。

591
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:49,840
好。

592
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,350
噉啊！請啊四位。

593
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:55,410
噉就係阿張超儀員。

594
01:55:56,150 --> 01:56:01,580
主席，嗱呢個位咧就要維期兩年。

595
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:09,430
就話係即係主要係誒為呢個長遠房屋策略咧，就制定呢個。

596
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:16,550
誒策略框架，誒同埋咧要監察呢個工作進度。

597
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:28,490
噉就有一個首長級，同埋加埋八個非首長級，咁加埋咧嗰個費用都接近一億一年，即係佢而家係九千幾萬一年。

598
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,680
我哋一般嘅。

599
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:45,050
即係想像咧，就係通常如果你政府一有一個新嘅策略或者一個政策嘅推動咧，最多工作咧就係喺你嗰個制定嘅過程啦。

600
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:56,930
誒公眾諮詢啦，然後最後你即係誒落實，或者即係紙紙梯層度做咗一個政策呢一個噉樣嘅誒。

601
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:03,330
文件出嚟，而呢個計呢個文件咧，跟住落嚟就當然係有一個計劃。

602
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:07,920
咁呢啲計劃咧，通常就會交翻畀你本身。

603
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:12,400
即係公務員唔同嘅部門就去推行㗎啦。

604
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,960
咁即係嗱，喺概念上咧，我係好難去。

605
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:21,540
明白點解？即係你最多工作嘅時候咧。

606
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:33,380
你就唔需要有一個咁即係咁大規模嘅偏外職位，你講緊當時都係做咗個誒九誒睇先。

607
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,900
幾幾多個月嘅一個臨時職位嘅啫。

608
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:57,450
咁但係就即係同埋你靠靠你自己內部抽調一啲臨時抽調一啲職員咧，就做咗呢個前期嘅最重要嘅工作。但係而家咧，你做好曬件事咧，你要推行嘅時候，你反而要整一個成個即係上層架構出嚟。

609
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:07,950
咁如果你話長遠房屋拆落，要你要你要監察佢，噉你長遠啊嘛，你講緊十年啊嘛，你而家係要攞兩年錢，即係又好似有啲矛盾。

610
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:28,360
畀啲時間佢答啦。可唔可以解釋一下咧？我完全唔明白嗰個概念。簡短啊，柏超生。嗯，Mr. Chairman，in fact，I I must remind members，the first part was the work carried out by the steering committee。Our support，our work in terms of the department was to support them and provide information。I had a working group，which I chaired。

611
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:48,370
包羅所有相關部門，所以我們結構它，來讓監督委員會領先。但現在它回到政府，現在是政府嘗試推動所有建議，它涵蓋很多不同嘅東西，從土地供應，從增加生產。

612
01:58:48,370 --> 01:59:08,380
from dealing with subdivided units and all of those very important issues, as well as issues that have been thrown up during the consultation exercise. So the work for government is really starting now. Before that, it's been led by the steering committee, and that's the way it's been structured. So what we've got to do is make sure that we're capable of taking forward that.

613
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:20,190
those recommendations that will come out of both the consultation exercise and their work over the last years and implement them quickly. That's why we want it for two years to get it done quickly.

614
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:40,480
啊！謝偉全議員，喂，主席，就頭先講咗咧，其實我都有少少唔明白，即係當然咧。之前就可能係需要咧呢個幫呢個長遠房屋誒拆六都道委員會咧需要人手，咁嗰個人手其實即係嗰陣時有個六個月嘅，但係好早已經係頭先好似白志高先生。

615
01:59:40,480 --> 02:00:00,490
講都已經停咗，就喺到三月嗰陣時，佢誒二零一三年嘅屆末。咁而家嚟講，嗰個諮詢咧，其實喺十二月，即係今日完啦噉樣。咁但係諮詢之後點樣行咧？其實即係而家我哋都唔知嘅。咁但係點解一開咧就開兩年咧？其實係咪即係你定咗即係諮詢咗有曬？

616
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:20,500
係嗰個政策咧，然後政府先去跟咧，亦或係而家你就一早定咗，因為你都唔知道諮詢最後咧嗰個督導委員會咧，最後根據嗰個諮詢係咪有個誒再有個建議畀翻政府咧誒，然後先定到個量咧嚇呢方面，即係點解咁早咧？我想即係。

617
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:40,510
即係或者政府可以解釋下啲，拍攝先生。Yes, that that's that's correct. Because of course, it must be implemented by the departments. Must be, for example, a series of recommendations for the housing authority to consider the the quota and points system, to consider the well-off tenants system. Those will be taken forward by the department. But there are there are

618
02:00:40,510 --> 02:01:00,520
wider issues that cover across government, where we need to make sure that we can drive the relevant departments to implement those issues. But we need first of all to get the right policies, because there's a series of recommendations that are going to come out of this exercise, which deal with, for example, we need to deal with perhaps regulation of.

619
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:20,530
分 subdivided units。That's a policy issue which needs to be taken forward. But the implementation, the executive part, will be taken forward by the departments. 譬如主席，我最即係唔明白咧，就因為而家都係諮詢緊嘛。最終嗰個建議係點咧？其實而家唔知嘅。噉你而家定咗即係需要幾多人手，係咪會過於？

620
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:40,540
好咗去定咗，可能你到時唔夠添啊，或者調轉頭你可能到時咧，嗰個督導委員會嗰個根據公眾嗰個意見咧，或者佢嗰個建議咧係有幾大，或者涉及幾多，而家唔知嘅喎，點解而家就定啦？我即係意思就係。

621
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:47,540
我已經可以見到，因為我們係根據建議書中所列明的建議，以及委員會報告。

622
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:55,000
on top of that, the public consultation exercise has given us the feedback from the community to those recommendations.

623
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:15,290
what we now need to do is marry the two. But we still need to take forward the recommendations. We know that that work has to be taken forward. And the purpose of the consultation exercise is to make sure that when we do the policy development, we're aware of the community interest and the priorities that the community is setting. But regardless of that.

624
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:27,380
That work on the policy development, we already know what has to be done. So that's why we're coming.咁主席，而家即係誒十二二號完咗，到四月一號嗰段時間，咪冇人做嘢，係咪啊，白兆醫生？

625
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:47,980
Well, Mr. The next stage, as we've announced, is that the steering committee will consider the feedback that they've received. They will then make their final recommendations to the government, for the government to respond to. And it it is that that next stage that we're really talking about. First.

626
02:02:47,980 --> 02:03:07,990
How does the government respond? And then what does the government actually do in terms of policy development and then implementation? And that's why we we need this this work in terms of the timing. We expect that the steering committee will have a series of meetings during December and January to finalise their consideration of the of the feedback.

627
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:26,440
And then they will submit their report in the first quarter of next year. That's why we're looking for the start of this this this post at the beginning of April. Once we've got the the report in place and government's initial feedback on that report, so the timing is carefully considered.

628
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:47,040
陳偉業議員，我主席，我係反對呢個文件嘅主席。就誒，嗱，你睇翻近年政府啲高層官員連續開撤咧，係好恐怖。即係你嗰個問責嘅制度，又加埋副局長，又加埋政治助理，係嘛？你跟住即係最近連續多個嘅助理處。

629
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:51,920
長位嗰個開設啊，包括即係呢個嘅誒。

630
02:03:52,200 --> 02:04:12,210
即係水警呢個呢個海事處啊，跟住啊呢個嘅東呢個嘅東南東南九龍發展又要又要加個五年嘅常設位啊，即係近期呢幾個月開設嘅高層官員嘅位咧，我諗係過去十幾年來嘅新高嘅，從未試過咁短期內開咁多高層嘅職位。

631
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:32,220
即係嗰種嘅高層膨脹嘅情況嘅，即係高速嘅進展咧，令人感到極為憂慮。我唔知係啲公務員或者係家下基於嘅問責制，基於梁振英嘅政府無能，導致到要不斷要增加呢啲位咧嚟幫佢呢一個嘅做勢係嘛？如果你講房屋供應，

632
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:52,230
啊！柏志高先生好清楚啦。你家下未來嗰十年都係預計四十八萬，每年都係四萬八啫嘛。同呢一個嘅當年啊，港英年代又好，董建華年代又好，每年八萬五啊，你都係當年嘅一半啫嘛。喂，你當年冇咁好經驗發展呢啲地區部門與部門之間啲協調咁嗰。

633
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:55,470
嗰陣時點啊？嗰陣時八萬五都係咁起啦～

634
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:58,700
即係你家下話推展呢個長策。

635
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:10,620
有啲咩新嘢咧？你都係按過去新市鎮嘅發展模式逐步去做，點解又突然間又要加位咧？點解加下啲官唔識做嘢㗎？加下啲官或者啲局長唔識做嘢㗎？

636
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:31,010
係嘛？如果你講翻嗰個工作量，以前八萬嗰個工作量比你多一倍有多啦。咁所以主席，即係你而家睇翻個政府嗰個運作模式咧，一個部門又係噉，一個局又係噉，不斷係要靠哦，即係以前做唔到嘢，或者係家下做唔到嘢，就賴唔夠人。咁以前做到。

637
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:34,050
做嘢嗰陣時，嗰啲官員點解做到嘢啊？

638
02:05:34,330 --> 02:05:42,080
啊！發出個聲音解釋啦，點解嗰陣時以嗰陣時嘅編制可以做到八萬五，家下要你做四萬八都咁困難咧？

639
02:05:42,810 --> 02:06:02,820
阿巴先生，Mr. Chairman，In fact，we reduced our establishment on the production following to the decisions in 2002. We lost，and we've explained this previously. We lost about a thousand something staff at the time，including directorate officers. And frankly，we're still way below the numbers that that we had at that。

640
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:22,830
時間， we're something like eight hundred, nine hundred posts below what we had at that time. So really, it's a very different context. The other point here is none of these are principal official posts. These are practical posts needed to do the job. Because my staff are really facing a huge amount of pressure from all of the initiatives that have been coming out and the incre

641
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:42,840
如果咁拍字好先，可唔可以畀個表我哋？Can you give can you give us give us a table to compare the staff provision? In fact, we've done at the peak of the housing provision, probably back in the early 1990s, as compared to now, so that we can so that we can have a comparison of staff provision.

642
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:55,030
You know during these two periods, so that we have a better understanding of the actual situation. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we did exactly that the last time we came to the panel, so we can easily give you that paper. It's no problem.

643
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:56,990
and。

644
02:06:57,650 --> 02:07:14,200
因為而家就快到四十五分，即係仲有盧偉國議員咧未講，咁咧就估計你講完咧就夠鐘，咁因此咧未處理完呢個文件，如果大家唔反對嘅，就畀我可以延長時間處理埋呢個議程先散會，好嘛？

645
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:24,940
好多謝各位。誒，請盧偉國議員。誒，多謝主席。首先申報咧，我係房委會、建築委員會同埋投標委員會嚇，即係兩個委員會嘅嘅成員。

646
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,390
嗯。

647
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:47,400
其實咧就呢個職位咧，誒據文件資料咧，就不單止係召喚長策會喺呢個諮詢工作裏邊咧，係誒收集意見之後嘅制定嗰個長遠房屋策略。因為根據嗰個附件A咧第二行咧進行經。

648
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:54,810
政策檢討以及因應長遠房屋策略檢討所提出嘅建議，推行政府同意落實的措施。

649
02:07:55,090 --> 02:08:15,100
咁其實，偷人誒措施咧，呢個可能更加長期嘅工作。咁所以咧，就我我就有個疑問，就係話而家講咧呢個職位咧就係為期兩年噉樣。咁但係真係如果牽涉到推行嘅話咧，可能又唔止兩年嘅工作㗎咯喎。其實嘅意思會唔會喺某個階段嘅話咧，實質嘅推行？

650
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:27,120
即係話，假如政策都已經落實誒，具體推行嘅話咧，其實工作就會都會去翻呢個房委會同埋誒房屋處嗰方面誒嘅職係嘅同事咧。

651
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:47,410
噉啊，另一個問題咧，就係誒喺我哋待議嘅事項裏邊咧，都有一行咧，就係提到話建議喺房屋署咧開設首長級職位，以應付因公營房屋嘅新建屋量咧目標所產生嘅額外工作量。誒呢度咧話有三個首長級嘅職位。

652
02:08:47,410 --> 02:09:05,530
可唔可以理解為咧？呢度所講嘅嚇，即係遲啲會遞上嚟嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅要求咧，所講嘅首長級職位咧，就係專業，即係即係話誒工程師啊，啊或者係誒其他嘅即係專業嘅首長級嚇，呢度稍為澄清一下啫。

653
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:26,310
Mr. Chairman, the the two things for the implementation side, it will involve not just the housing authority, but a number of different departments. Depending on on the outcome, it might involve rating and valuation department. It may involve fire services, buildings, etc. So we will we will have to work.

654
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:46,320
Coordinate that response. That's why this central figure is so important. And yes, the other posts that we're seeking are technical posts related to the construction programme, and they are they're going to be dealing specifically with engineering. I can't remember off off the top of my head, but it's engineering and.

655
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:55,690
Architects and I think surveyors, the three. But we will we'll give you the detail next year. But those are purely technical posts, not pay posts.

656
02:09:55,970 --> 02:10:09,580
好，主席，我係即係支持而家呢個誒建議啊，增加呢個首長級、丙級職務官係負責今日所講嘅呢個支援呢個長策會嘅工作嘅，主席。好。

657
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:18,570
阿張志雄議員，你簡短啊嘛，第二輪。好，好，你簡短。我我就睇曬文件，聽完今日嘅常備嘅解釋，我都。

658
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:28,950
即係冇説服到我哋咧，係覺得呢一個誒首長級再加佢成八個職位呢個噉嘅編制咧，係有個必要性。

659
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:36,830
誒，所以即係我都要表明，即係我哋唔支持呢個呢個建議。咁如果佢照上嘅話咧，

660
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:45,150
就佢一定要分開，即喺財委會分開嚟，即佢未去財委會嘅，仲要人事編制咯，其實。

661
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:50,740
可以請佢係補充啲資料嘅人士，邊陣再去誒講多啲啦嚇。

662
02:10:51,330 --> 02:10:53,310
你講完未啊？講完。

663
02:10:53,590 --> 02:11:13,600
啊！即係當然，即係最後決定等委員會決定。但係如果係，我覺得即係頭先我問嗰啲嘅問題咧，我覺得要有一個全面嘅解答。究竟成個組合喺嗰個整體人力供嗰個需求同埋個房屋供應嗰個比較，同之前嗰幾年或者十幾廿年前嗰個比較係點咧？我哋睇曬呢個圖畫，截推薦畀。

664
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:16,400
人力編制咧，我覺得至為合合適啲咯。

665
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:22,760
即係你未有一個噉嘅圖畫嘅話咧，你夾硬堆上去，到時我又去又再問啫嘛。

666
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:43,280
啊嘛，阿潘教授，Mr. Chairman, there there are two things I must clarify. We will provide the information, but what we're talking about here really relates as much to the policy side as to the production side. So the production figures, and the other thing to remember is that back in 2002, when the the bureau

667
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:57,380
當The Department were combined, there were a number of posts that were were cut from the bureau. So effectively, we're we're also down on the bureau side. So I will try and give you a full picture so that members have a have a clear view as to where we are today compared to where we were before.

668
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:01,930
我需要回睇until those figures before we make a decision。

669
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:04,260
你打嘅。

670
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:06,740
噉你下一次開會就決定咯，主席。

671
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:25,730
而家都唔夠人啦，即係我哋都建議佢，如果係咧，就再提供多啲資料。其實佢呢啲職位究竟做乜嘅？即係如果你話就咁空泛地話，誒嗰個策略框架啊，或者將來即係監察個落實咧。

672
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:46,020
其實你講緊監察落實啲乜嘢先得㗎？到你而家都未未決定，你就已經要開成即係兩億呢個噉嘅要求嚟咧。而且呢啲係好明顯係上層嘅結構，噉你下層嗰啲就做到即係踢曬腳。噉我哋係猛咁即係如果係批你上層嗰度計。

673
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:52,860
