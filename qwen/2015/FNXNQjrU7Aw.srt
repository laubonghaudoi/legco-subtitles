Good morning.

75
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,590
個文件早前已經秘書處畀咗大家兩份背景嘅資料簡介㗎啦。

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:26,130
噉啊！首先，我哋請民政事務局常任秘書長楊林梅先生同埋西九管理局嘅代表介紹依份文件。

77
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,870
請啊，好啊，好主席，唔該。

78
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:50,160
誒主席誒，過去幾個月咧就誒西九文化區嘅規劃咧，喺不同嘅方面都取得咗進展嘅。咁喺硬件工程方面咧，就誒戲曲中心大家都已經知道，今年九月已經開工動工興建㗎啦。咁誒M plus呢個博物館啊、小型藝術展館同埋公園等等嘅工程咧。

79
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,040
咧，亦都係相繼咁展開咗，都進行緊。

80
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:04,660
喺文化軟件方面咧，就西九文化區嘅管理局咧，誒都籌備咗係列嘅表演藝術同埋視覺文化嘅活動，主要嘅目的都係想拓展翻嗰個觀眾羣嚇。

81
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:21,140
咁管理局亦都進行咗各種嘅誒培育藝術人員嘅計劃啦，亦都採用咗多種嘅方式咧，同各個持份者咧同埋公眾咧係保持聯繫，收集佢哋嘅意見，同埋同佢哋分享翻誒所有各方面嘅進度發展嘅。

82
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:41,440
咁誒管理局提交嘅文件咧，大家收收到咧，都已經詳細展述咗呢方面嘅最新嘅情況。或者喺呢個時候誒，如果主席容許咧，我想請管理局嘅行政總裁連立志先生咧，係作出個補充。咁稍後管理局嘅誒代表咧，亦都會採用誒投影片嘅方式咧，係向議員簡介翻誒氣局。

83
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,540
中心同埋MPlus嘅發展嘅，多謝主席。Okay, Mr. Lynch, please.

84
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:59,280
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations on your re-election to chair this committee. Very pleased to be back here again for the next session of the Ledges Sub-Committee on West Kalimant.

85
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:19,570
I guess the key issues for us come from the decisions that were made in June at the June board meeting to adopt the pragmatic approach to implementing the project. We've been moving very quickly and diligently through the summer and a.

86
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:39,580
Into a critical new stage, which I think is important in the overall development of the project. As you'll be aware, the Zishu Centre broke ground on the twenty-fourth of September, meaning that construction, after many long years, has finally started. We regard that as an important milestone. The work on that side on.

87
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:59,590
Kanton Road is well underway. We're ahead of budget and on that first piece of work and on time. We've been working very diligently over the last few months on the two major capital projects. At this point, Zhi Shu M Plus, and in addition to that.

88
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:15,680
Very detailed negotiations with government on the development of the basement underneath the major part of the site, and my colleagues Dr Nitva and Mr Yu will present the details in their presentations to you.

89
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,780
We're clearly also working very hard on the people and the content development.

90
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:42,070
looking at audience issues, capacity building, stakeholder engagement. We're in the midst of engagement, following the sessions earlier this year, with the performing arts committee, with all of the companies across all of the sectors, to talk about some of the changes that have taken place and how we will work with them over the coming years.

91
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,460
係。

92
00:12:42,750 --> 00:13:02,760
We've got a fantastic range of activities that will be coming up over, beginning this weekend with the Clock and Fab Festival, the Block Party, and then our own Free Space Festival two weeks before Christmas. A vastly expanded Bamboo Theatre Project, which will encompass significant.

93
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:22,770
Major performers from China coming in to participate in the Bamboo Theatre project. A large proportion of Cantonese opera, but also a range of other activities, including some commercial theatre projects that will extend the life of the Bamboo Theatre. As your members.

94
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:42,780
Will be aware the bamboo theatre is no longer able to be done on the Canton Road site. It now needs to be done on the actual site, and so we're moving forward on that front. We have a major building M plus exhibition opening in January, and our first digital exhibition on Hong Kong neon signs, which will also be happening in the first part.

95
00:13:42,780 --> 00:14:02,790
part of the year. I guess the other important issue has been the progress on our website. I think we now have one of the best multilingual websites for an arts organisation or any sort of organisation in Hong Kong. That came online two weeks ago, and we see that as an important part of improving our dialogue.

96
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:20,260
with the arts community and the various stakeholders, it has all information about the the work that we're doing in terms of the building projects, the projects that are that are coming forward, and enables all sorts of connections to be made with the broader arts community and the broader community.

97
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:32,290
On that note, I would now ask the executive directors, Dr Nitfa and Mr Lewis Yu, to highlight the development of Zshu and M+ to this point. Mr Yu.

98
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,040
Besides you.

99
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:49,910
佢佢誒唔該曬主席，我而家誒會介紹誒，我而家同誒陳文偉博士會分一齊咧嚟到介紹戲曲中心而家嘅進度。我諗由陳文偉博士介紹下工程嘅進度先。

100
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:11,250
係主席啊！咁或者我好簡單嘅用呢個誒幾分鐘嘅講一講咧個氣局中心，我相信大家都會幾誒熟悉呢個氣局中心。不過我用一個盡快講一講佢嗰個硬件嘅嘅設計點樣先，因為而家我哋整個工作咧就係做緊呢個深化設計嘅深化。咁大家都知道咧，呢個喺誒喺個。

101
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:31,260
中心咧就喺個啊啊柯士甸道同埋廣東道嘅交界個好重要嘅地方，即係話我哋喺成個區嘅東大門就係希谷中心。咁依個咧就係佢嘅嘅設計嘅地方。噉佢嘅主要咧就喺隔離咧就有誒好重要嘅交通嘅嘅嘅嘅重點咧，就係喺柯士甸道西咧，其實。

102
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:51,270
廣東道咧，亦都係喺嗰個Austin站嘅附近嘅。噉你睇翻咧，我哋其實喺個中心裏邊咧，主體咧裏邊咧有幾種好重要嘅用途。嗰個咧就係講嗰個誒中心啊，起個中心啦，同埋個茶館啦。但係除此之外咧，亦都有一個藝術教育設施啦、零售、餐飲、消閒設施啦，亦都有公共有嘅嘅。

103
00:15:51,270 --> 00:16:11,280
嘅嘅空間嘅咁成個中心係一個中心咧，除咗係誒戲曲之外咧，有其他嘅用途。咁呢一個咧就係誒譚炳榮建築師同埋呂元祥總工師嘅設計嘅外觀。而家嗰個嗰個進度，我哋而家仲係做緊一個內部深化嘅設計。咁當然我哋個地基亦都開始開墾咗嘅。

104
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:24,980
咁成依個咧就個最最新嘅外觀啦，咁亦都喺裏邊咧有好多嘅誒誒天台嘅花園啊之類咧，就畀大家用嘅。咁或者我交翻畀阿阿Louis咧，就講一講裏邊個內涵嘅點樣嚇。

105
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:45,280
喺過誒，主席喺過去嘅一年裏邊咧，我哋係不停咁同誒戲曲界啦，同埋誒設計師咧一齊喺度設計緊、深化緊設計裏邊嘅內容。噉你而家投影片裏邊見到咧，就係一個地面嘅一個我哋叫做有蓋廣場或者叫做中庭嘅地方。咁呢個地方咧，其實咧就係誒有誒。

106
00:16:45,330 --> 00:17:05,340
通道咧就連接到誒誒柯士甸站嘅一個入口嘅，咁所以啊，將來喺柯士甸站出到嚟嘅時候咧，就會去到呢個友蓋廣場嘅地方。呢個友蓋廣場嘅地方，除咗會係一個非常之繁忙同埋好多人人流嘅通道之外咧，呢個廣場咧上邊咧仲有一個誒高層嘅一個誒平台。咁呢個平台咧。

107
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:13,940
可以供到誒臨時嘅演出咧，或者係一啲展覽咧，或者一啲講座嘅活動，咁會係一個相當受歡迎嘅一個誒嘅空間嚟嘅。

108
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:34,730
下一張圖咧係另一個角度，誒由將來嘅入口地面個層面嗰裏邊咧，就睇到個戲曲中心嗰個中庭個情況係點樣樣。你會見得到咧，行入嚟嘅時候就會誒會去喺右呢度嘅右手邊咧，就會去到地鐵站啦。喺誒直前面咧就會經過幾級樓梯咧，就會上到一個誒平台。

109
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:46,110
可以喺裏邊咧就可以做到啲演出或者展覽，而上邊咧係唔同嘅層數嘅設施，包括有啲餐飲嘅設施啊、茶館嘅設施啊、教育嘅設施啊，最頂咧其實係個劇場嘅底部嚟嘅。

110
00:17:47,310 --> 00:18:07,320
過去嗰幾月裏邊咧，我哋做咗唔同嘅一啲測試咧，就係測試將來我哋個設計個內容係點樣樣。呢個咧就係其中一個測試咧。我哋就係誒將來我哋會有一個茶館劇場。咁個茶館劇場會係一個比較誒親密嘅誒嘅一個小型嘅一個表演空間。噉我哋而家咧就喺一個地方裏邊咧，就係砌。

111
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:27,330
砌咗啲凳啊，同埋一啲臨時嘅舞台嚟到咧，畀建築師感受下，譬如話中國嘅戲曲嘅呢方面嘅茶館個個設計會係點樣啊？同埋我哋點樣適合噉樣喺裏邊做一啲適合嘅燈光啊，同埋音響設計嘅要求。你羽毛球咧喺呢個地方咧，將來唔使用麥唔使用擴音咧，都好一個好好嘅誒聲學嘅空間咧。

112
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,830
可以做到我哋嘅表現。

113
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:50,050
咁誒戲曲中心咧，誒誒同業界咧一路喺度傾緊會唔會有足夠嘅排練設施，結果咧而家我哋最後去到而家呢個階段咧，我哋可以confirm得到咧，我哋有幾我哋有兩個排練室啦，兩個大嘅排練室咧嘅高度係相當之足夠，可以畀到戲曲嘅排練嚟到做。咁跟住我哋誒會有兩個。

114
00:18:50,050 --> 00:19:02,160
中型排練室咧，同埋四個小型排練室。咁呢個噉樣嘅排練室咧，將來咧就會為將來戲曲嘅中中心嘅新嘅製作啦，為咗將來嘅教育同埋傳承咧，就扮演一個好重要嘅角色。

115
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:22,740
咁戲曲中心咧，我哋仍然咧係誒誒保留咗咧，我哋有兩個好重要嘅，除咗頭先我講一個高嘅排練室嘅之外咧，我哋做事咧仲會有一個一百五十至到一至到一百八十位嘅一個誒演講廳。咁呢個演講廳可以我嚟做教育嘅活動啦，同埋一啲公眾嘅活動咧，亦都可以喺演出之前或演出之後咧令。

116
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,100
藝術家可以同誒同誒公眾可以見面嘅。

117
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:48,120
下一個呢個咧就係一個圖咧，就大概可以畀你睇到我哋而家個方向咧劇場內部嘅情況係點樣樣。你會見得到會有一啲誒比較多弧形嘅設計啦，咁令到嗰個感覺咧都係有一個現代嘅感覺喺個座位嘅安排裏邊咧。我哋務求咧大部分嘅座位咧都會係誒會有好好嘅視線嘅效果啦。

118
00:19:48,120 --> 00:20:05,780
同埋我哋而家亦都係同誒誒設計師啦，同埋一啲唔同嘅誒持份者人士咧，喺度商討緊輪椅位嘅安排。噉，務求咧呢個喺戲曲中心裏邊嘅誒輪椅位嘅設施咧，會係係超乎即係比而家誒法例嘅最低嘅限度咧，係會為多嘅。

119
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:26,770
咁誒化妝間都係業界一路嘅要求嘅嘢，噉我亦都做咗個做咗唔同嘅測試。咁呢個測試咧就我喺地下畫咗啲線咧，就叫一啲誒粵劇嘅老倌攞佢自己嘅衣箱咧，就拜誒拉入嚟我哋模擬嘅化妝室裏邊嗰啲門係點開啊？誒同埋唔同嘅位係點樣樣啊？嗰啲化妝台可唔可以摺起啊？咁呢啲咁長。

120
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,200
詳細同埋細緻嘅嘅測試咧，我哋都係同業界同埋設計師係一齊做嘅。

121
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:52,850
咁另外一個啦，都係誒業界要求嘅，就係大嘅化妝間。咁呢個咧可以容納到三十幾個人嘅化妝間，大型嘅誒化妝間。咁喺呢個咧就會好喺好近誒劇院嘅層面裏邊咧，就會有兩個類似嘅化妝間。噉我冇求做到咧方便到咧，所有化妝間都會喺劇院嗰層後台嗰層。

122
00:20:52,850 --> 00:21:10,010
所以唔需要有任何演員咧，需要上一層或者落一層咧，去到油化中間，去到舞台。咁呢個咧都係由誒一路咧都係由設計師誒西九同埋業界咧一齊係商討到出到嚟。我已經去到一個相當啲詳細嘅設計嘅階段。咁或者交翻畀MWO。

123
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:30,360
係啊，Louis，即係我再再講一講啦，因為個成個建築物咧本身就唔係一個單丁自己就可以誒可以完成，因為其其實佢依個建築物同側邊周遭嘅環境咧有好大關係，咁亦都對我哋嗰個建設咧好大嘅影響。噉你睇翻成個圖咧，你喺北邊咧有一個我哋叫做園景平台咧，依個就係連接咗。

124
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:50,370
過去依個柯士甸站，當然個地底亦都有個隧道直接入柯士甸站啦。咁喺佢嘅右邊咧，其實咧喺地下咧有一個叫做誒西鐵嘅地鐵線噉。咁呢個我哋一定要避咗佢哋，影響到佢個西鐵嘅嘅運作。咁呢個喺建築方面咧，亦都係一個幾困難嘅，但係我哋都會要去排除呢個困難，去睇得到佢喺廣東度。

125
00:21:50,370 --> 00:22:07,550
咧就改善工程做到，因為廣東道而家都係好擠塞，咁亦嘅做緊多咗幾條路線嘅改善工程。當然南邊咧，你見到有誒消防局喺度，噉我哋亦都要咧就唔可以影響到佢嘅運作。咁喺喺西邊咧，就西九成個地庫，嗰啲好大嘅地庫咧，點樣同佢聯係嘅？

126
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,130
噉你見到咧，頭先我講過咧，喺阿士軒站嘅環境平台咧，將來咧有一個平台過嚟。

127
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:25,640
咁講翻頭先個困難係點咧？嗱，依一個咧就係西鐵線好早以前咧，其實個鐵路線嘅下底，我哋而其實我哋個屁股中心就喺佢隔離，噉我哋亦都唔可以影響到佢嘅運作嘅。

128
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:35,660
噉你睇翻而家咧，我哋喺呢個圖嘅最左手邊咧，其實就係起居中心。咁中間又好大幅嘅地方咧，而家仍然都係高鐵工作嘅界面。

129
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,210
我哋嘅嘅建築咧，一定要唔可以影響到佢。

130
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:59,500
咁當然，我哋亦都已經開展咗嗰個工程啦。我哋九月已經開始動工。咁成個地居工程咧，我哋希望咧喺誒誒主體嘅合約咧，就係一四年嘅第一二季招標，大概係三四月度咧。咁成個誒occupation permit咧，即係嗰個誒佔用許可證咧，就係大概係二零一六年就取。

131
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,040
到嘅。

132
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:08,240
咁或者我而家咧，以下咧就交落嚟咧，就畀阿阿李立偉博士咧繼續講解咧MPlus嘅個格。

133
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,820
yes.

134
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,380
design primarily.

135
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,430
Design for M Plus taking place in Hong Kong this week, so Dr. Nethvapli.

136
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:37,930
Okay, thank you, and thank you, Chairman, and good morning, Members. Yes, it's true. M Plus is now has now since three months back been in an intense design process from the winning competition brief.

137
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:58,220
just a short reminder of the site we're talking about. It's this area. It's the sort of western end of the urban part of the district, and also a little reminder that this is what one easily sees as the M Plus building. But as you will see from from other

138
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:05,590
images and plans that it actually the M+ building actually continues underground here and sticks up again in this.

139
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:13,090
Rectangle this building, so it's actually a larger, larger building than than it first looks like.

140
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:29,180
This is the M+ site and its location on the other end of the big basement, you can say. And of course, the reason why we can start building here and over here is exactly because it's at the end of the of the basement area.

141
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:38,600
這是The M Plus Building， and I think what the jury focused on when selecting.

142
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:59,040
赫茲格和杜梅朗，和這個partnership joint venture with TFP Ferrells， here in Hong Kong and Arabs Hong Kong， was really it's how it could sort of resolve three things. On one hand， be a building that could hold its own against the back

143
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:19,050
drop of the high skyscrapers behind it, while at the same time making the most of the relationship with, with of course Victoria Harbour in front of the building, and at the same time creating a situation where on one hand the objects that would be on display would feel at home, that it would would be a

144
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:35,650
friendly environment for the objects, for the art, for the design and so forth, while at the same time being a very good and I would say very democratic building. I'll get back to that. Very welcoming, where people feel that it's their building, it's their museum.

145
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:49,200
所以有個合資企業，之間三個公司，佢哋似乎係working very well together。The design process has been going on，as I said，for three months。We are now in

146
00:25:49,480 --> 00:26:08,670
what is called schematic design phase and we will before Christmas reach what is called the stage which is called 70% schematic design, which means that we're really starting to see what the what the interior of the building also would look like and details are being developed.

147
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,220
誒。

148
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:31,670
我 mention the sense of democratic space， and I think this is something that is absolutely fundamental to the experience of M Plus and the M Plus building. This is a vista you get when you come from Artists Square and maybe you've been walking along the avenue or you come.

149
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:51,680
from elements and from that side from the north or from from the east, and you can see how this is the entrance is something that is almost like a continuation of public space. It's not like a high staircase or so. It's a very inviting space and also as

150
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:06,140
我 hope you can see on this image. When you look through the building, you see through the building. It is transparent, so it also opens up towards the amazing views, of course, of the Hong Kong Island skyline and Victoria Harbour.

151
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:12,810
所以，我認為呢個呢個設定咗個調子，幾多啲對於個建築。

152
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:33,810
Get back to more of the design qualities, but just to give a framework for the distribution of space. What sort of space are we are we looking at here? What one thinks about in a museum is of course that they're full of galleries, and in reality, when you visit

153
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:50,950
A major museum, the galleries are roughly around a third of the museum. Then you have a lot of circulation space. Of course, you have shops, cloakrooms and lobbies and so forth, which is called general public spaces.

154
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:59,000
dedicated learning facilities are very important. It's an extremely important aspect of M+ and the whole M+ project.

155
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:19,860
Of course, there has to be offices. Naturally, there is storage and conservation. That's also a central aspect of a function of a museum to be able to store, but also look after the collections. And then you have the unavoidable support and operations, plant rooms and whatnot, security rooms and all these things.

156
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:34,770
If we look at the building, and now you see how much more complex the building actually is compared to when you when you look at the renderings with this sort of horizontal and vertical slab.

157
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,800
It is basically, you have the the the.

158
00:28:40,470 --> 00:29:00,480
horizontal slab here. So this is the entrance from the artist square that I just pointed out, and you come into this quite transparent lobby area, which houses a number of functions like educational spaces, but also ticketing, one of the big temporary exhibition spaces, a shop and.

159
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,690
其他functions。

160
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:12,070
And if you go upstairs, you come to the main exhibition floor, which is a floor of galleries with a central orientation area in the middle.

161
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:20,650
如果你 go downstairs， you come down into this area， which is one of the other。

162
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:40,940
extraordinary parts of this and that's the moving image centre where you have a number of smaller cinemas but also groundbreaking if not revolutionary space for people to look at other at moving image in a non-cinema space which is very unique and innovative.

163
00:29:41,390 --> 00:30:01,400
The found space I will come to very soon, and its its neighbour, the industrial space, which is a very high ceiling, almost film studio like space, which can accommodate all sorts of things. Then you see, here's back of house. This is storage, loading docks, all these functions that are typically.

164
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:14,300
Back of a house, and then you have the little tower behind, which is basically storage, and on the top, of course, the very important conservation studios or laboratories.

165
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,430
所以，這是The Layout of the Building。

166
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:35,640
now I was mentioning the found space and one easily thinks that West Kaloon is this sort of just flat barren piece of land, but under the building, diagonally under the building goes this enormous structure which is the Airport Express Tunnel.

167
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,490
and this is the way it looked when it was being built.

168
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,490
一 decade plus ago.

169
00:30:42,350 --> 00:31:00,300
And this was in the architecture competition. We could see how all the shortlisted architects, in various ways, tried to pretend it wasn't there, or they tried to cover it up, or or manoeuvre themselves around it in a way that always created problems for their architectural solutions.

170
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:21,080
在case of Herzog de Murat， they did something that is very typical for them. They rather said embrace the problem, went with the flow， and and said that yes， we have this strange structure underneath. Let's see what it can do for us. And they rather created an excavation， where they actually。

171
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:41,090
Show us that structure in the basement, and gave us a space which we call the found space because it was basically found there. Which is a very unique and very exciting, very open exhibition space, which will be ideal for commissioning works by artists, designers and.

172
00:31:41,090 --> 00:32:01,100
所以， to work in in a way they of course used a similar strategy as they did when they created the Great Turbine Hall in in Tate Modern. They are the architects of the of the of Tate Modern, but also of the so-called Bird's Nest National Stadium in Beijing, among many many other.

173
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:17,400
Examples. This is a very exciting and of course space which will also make the museum absolutely unique and will give it its very special character. A little bit in the same way as the turbine hall does for Tate Modern.

174
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:33,310
If we go up, I was mentioning the upper floors where the galleries are. This is just a view of the sort of central space on the upper floor where you make your choices whether you want to go basically into.

175
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:53,930
any of four suites of galleries that we have there, you can say that this look relatively barren now or quite barren now, and I think that when the museum is up and running, it will not be as empty. It will. We will definitely make use of the walls here, both for art to commission artists to do things there, but also.

176
00:32:53,930 --> 00:33:11,050
Of course, to advertise the various exhibitions, displays that all the choices you have on this floor. So I think it will be a much more colourful space than than we see at the present. But it's a very important space for orientation to find your way.

177
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:31,470
And actually, one of the this is a very, very large museum. We should remember that it is on the scale of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, for example. And orientation is an absolutely central thing, and that's one of the great solutions also in this architectural scheme. Here you stand on the.

178
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:45,670
lobby level the artist square level and then there are openings so you can actually understand where you are and what is upstairs and what is downstairs you look down and you look down into the different layers sorry.

179
00:33:48,010 --> 00:34:08,020
或的found space， and you can also look up and see understand that there is a tower above. You look straight up into a shaft that exposes the tower, but also that you have a floor above where you have the exhibition galleries. So it's very transparent and self-explanatory. You won't need a lot of signage.

180
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,640
Despite the fact that it's a very big building.

181
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:29,970
This is still to large extent the work in progress, and this is actually three weeks old. Or drawing of the layout of the galleries of from the gallery floor, where we in the yellow part was in the middle, where we had an image from that I said is a little bit empty.

182
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:42,770
但基本上，我們看的是，這會是其中一個大型空間用於臨時展覽。然後我們看三個畫廊組合，像這樣。

183
00:34:43,060 --> 00:35:03,070
And this is the third one, which all will have slightly different character, different scales, varying ceiling heights and so forth for different stories of the collection. And they mainly for the collection. And as you remember, it's not only an art collection; it's design, architecture and moving image.

184
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,910
as well.

185
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:09,140
And many of them have their own special features.

186
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:26,510
Here it says jukebox and that may look intriguing. It's not jukebox for music though. It's actually a plan for a space that is somewhere in between a gallery and a storage space, an automatic

187
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,780
誒。

188
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:49,920
Gallery， you can say where you can ask to see certain works， and just like in a jukebox， the images come to you。 But actually， it's not just a picture of the work， it's actually the real work。 And this has been used in one or two instances in the world before similar solutions， and it's really a way of creating more access to。

189
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,890
一larger part of the collection.

190
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:04,590
We have a tower, and I haven't said much about that, but I will do that now. And if we look at what you will find in the tower.

191
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,600
可以説，那， on the。

192
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,230
on the so here we have the exhibition floor.

193
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,770
with an extra high ceiling here, then comes.

194
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:36,310
Well, we we call it café and brasserie now, but actually, what kind of cuisine there will be? But the café opens up into a space you'll see very soon, which is the the roof of the of the horizontal building. So it will be some sort of indoors and outdoors, also including alf.

195
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:56,320
Fresco and and easy relaxed, then so there is a second restaurant there, then comes a research centre which is open to the public, which is library for education purposes and so forth, then there are a few floors of offices, then you come up to this level where.

196
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:16,330
says members' room also, but I think it's important to remember that members' room is this part, given that we have a membership scheme for the museum. To the right, and there is an image that shows this a little bit clearer. Actually, there will be what is called a sky garden, and this is open to the museum visitors.

197
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:28,090
Again, and so that all the upper floors, including the restaurants, are there. So people who visit the museum will also be able to have the great views from above.

198
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,280
this is the same structure seen from the side.

199
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,640
嗯。

200
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:56,140
And this gives you an idea also of the tower and how it works. This is important, and there will be one more image of this. Here you see through the tower and you see the huge, and it's actually I think 5,000 square metres of open landscape space on the roof.

201
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:16,150
Of the museum facing south, which is open and it's actually public access. It's public open space, so it will be accessible for also non-museum visitors. As you visit the park, you can visit this roof. There will be of course some ability.

202
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:30,830
Some chances, as I mentioned, to have a cup of something and but also to walk around, probably to enjoy art and so forth. Then you have the other floors, and here this is almost a view of the sky garden.

203
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:41,160
and I think that floor slab shouldn't be there, and that will create an amazing experience of looking out on the eleventh floor of the building.

204
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:48,480
但通過一個 Garden 情況，出向維多利亞港和香港島的天際線。

205
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,860
所以，那係一個quite unique feature， and I think an exciting experience in itself.

206
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:01,300
here we also can see how people are walking around on that.

207
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:10,090
huge terrace on top of the the galleries, the gallery floor, and on the south side of the tower.

208
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:31,820
The entrances, I should also mention, there's one entrance from from Art Square, that's maybe the main entrance. But on this level, there is one direct access in from from the park. So if you stroll along the the coast or or along the waterfront, you have, and there is also an entrance in.

209
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:48,610
The other end of the building, which is straight from the basement, so where there are drop-off base and and for buses and school classes and and and so forth. So you come in into on that level if you come by car and are being dropped off, for example.

210
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:57,250
And we are still on schedule for an occupation permit in December 2017.

211
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,700
多謝主席。

212
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,570
我。

213
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,460
questions the members would like to put to us.

214
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,020
Either specifically related to the two projects, or more broadly.

215
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,460
啊，秘書長有冇補充啊？

216
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,120
咁咧，我哋就有。

217
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,230
誒。

218
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,460
大概一個鐘頭多啲嘅時間咧，去到十點半鐘討論呢一部分。

219
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,820
咁咧就我哋。

220
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,720
人又唔係好多啦，噉。

221
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,030
先四分鐘先啦，可能有兩輪啦嚇，噉。

222
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,030
會松一啲啦，噉。

223
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:46,540
請要發問嘅同事咧，就即係舉手嚇。而家我手頭收到就係蔣麗雲、劉慧卿、黃碧雲。

224
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,640
就冇其他同事，佢實一路佢實得。

225
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,890
O.K.首先開始，蔣麗雲議。

226
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,650
多謝主席。

227
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:23,170
啊！我想啊，問一問咧，就有關戲曲中心咧，就而家嗯都有好多朋友同我反映，就話戲曲中心咧而家得翻誒一千一百個座位，咁咧有冇可能？因為而家新光戲院咧就誒都有差唔多係都一千一百嘅，都都。

228
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:34,350
都接近一千一百㗎啦。咁咧就，既然有個新嘅戲曲中心，噉啊，會唔會考慮將呢個戲曲中心啊，即係應該可以再增加多啲座位咧？咁？

229
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:41,920
咁另外咧，我亦都想知道咧，就有個茶館啦，茶館嗰度又可以坐幾多人咧？咁嚇。

230
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,230
咁另外咧就係誒。

231
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:56,620
我想問一問咧，就係嗰個誒大型表演場地咧，誒誒嗰個誒，太攣啦！嚇，嗰個係咪一個誒露天嘅？

232
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,460
嗰個係概念係一個露天嘅表演場地，係咪啊？定係都係密封嘅嚇。

233
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,090
噉就嗯嚇，不如你答住先啦嚇，唔該。阿阿餘生。

234
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:28,850
我會答部分的問題，主席。我們不是在位置，劇院的容量一直間隔在一千一百或一千二百個座位，而且我們，這不是可能改變劇院的容量，一旦建築物通過設計競賽。

235
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:48,860
then the design and now into the the final stages. Clearly, it's determined determined both by money, by the scope of the site and the scope of the the winning design. But we think that that is for the demands of the Zishu community, of which we've talked to.

236
00:42:48,860 --> 00:43:08,870
Lot, we have our advisory committee now set up to advise us on that. That that is the the ideal number of seats for us to deal with in terms of the theatre. We will then have the range of other theatres over the the theatre of different sizes. The tea house has a capacity of about two.

237
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:28,880
兩百八十人，which will be able to do small work, tourist work, developmental work, and and and in the long term development within the capacity of the theatre itself, there is a further space for a second stage four hundred seat theatre beyond.

238
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,680
This one, but I might get Lewis to just address a couple of the other issues for you.

239
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,270
係咪啊，Lucy啊？

240
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:55,560
唔該曬誒，唔該曬主席誒。首先誒，一千一百位咧，其實係一個幾適合喺戲曲嘅嘅演出嘅嘅場地。咁當時亦都係因為即係新光戲院係一千一百位，其實香港嘅戲曲演出咧，佢哋覺得幾舒服呢個座位。咁誒誒，我哋亦都知道咧，同時我哋亦都知道。

241
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:15,570
康文署咧喺明年咧都會開另一個戲曲場，就叫做新誒叫做誒高山劇場新翼，咁個係一個六百位嘅場地。噉啊，因為噉嘅原因咧，我哋誒戲曲中心裏邊原本預計有一個四百位嘅中型劇場咧，我哋而家咧就擺咗喺戲曲中心嘅第二期嚟到嚟到做。噉啊，我哋就唔會一開始嘅時候咧就會。

242
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:35,580
開嘅一個四百位嘅場地，但係我哋會喺個中心運作到一段時間之後咧，我哋就會誒考慮咧喺裏邊咧改建某啲空間咧，就變成一個多一個四百位嘅場地。咁頭先誒C.O有講係個茶館咧，其實咧裏邊我哋有一個大嘅茶館同埋一個細嘅茶館，大嗰個咧就二百位，細嗰個咧大概有八。

243
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:55,590
十位嘅空間咁可以做到啲曲藝嘅演出啊！咁小型嘅空誒小型嘅演出噉樣樣咁誒。議員頭先有提過咧，有個叫大型表演場地嘅大型表演場地咧，喺我哋西九嘅整體嗰個規劃裏邊咧，我哋叫做mega performance venue。咁嗰個係一個室內嘅大型嘅誒演出嘅音樂誒誒。

244
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:12,980
流行流行演出嘅空間嚟嘅，咁唔係一個唔係一個户外嘅場地。縱然而家喺我哋諗考慮裏邊咧，將來個公園裏邊咧，我哋會提供一個大型嘅誒户外嘅演出嘅場地咧，係畀到誒户外嘅演出。咁呢個係一個户外嘅空間。

245
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,910
係留喎，星期二。

246
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:35,340
誒多謝主席。誒首先咧，主席我就多謝阿阿連立恆先生啦，同埋佢啲同事咧，就琴日嚟民主黨咧，係同我哋傾，同埋我同阿黃碧雲議員係介紹佢啲嘢。噉我哋民主黨係好歡迎咧，係西九管理局嘅成員啊，係誒任何時間如果有嘢係想同我哋傾啊，問我哋咧，就算。

247
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:55,350
當局都好咧，我哋好歡迎有多啲嘅溝通，因為呢個項目咧係非常之龐大，亦都係充滿咗困難。噉我哋係收到好多方面嘅意見啦，係好擔心咧。誒一就可能又繼續超支啦，咁所以呢個戲曲中心嗰度都減咗個停車場啊。誒其他嗰啲項目咧，我哋希望真係要好。

248
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:15,360
謹慎睇實佢啊！誒，就要誒適時去，即係冇冇即係延遲啦。希望因為佢又話嗰個高鐵嗰度啊，影響佢哋嗰啲工程啦，同埋嗰啲價錢啊，主席。咁另外一樣咧，我都琴日同佢哋講咧，就係嗰啲誒藝嗰啲誒表演團體咧，主席佢哋又。

249
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:35,370
有啲同我講咧，就話最近咧係政務司司長係同佢哋見過面，聽咗佢哋好長嘅講嘢，噉佢哋好開心。咁其實佢一向都係好擔心，即係你起曬啲硬件出嚟，點樣分配咧？邊個用邊度咧？咁琴日我亦都聽到就係話，原來觀塘咧又有一棟嘢，又有啲誒咩咩表演場地。

250
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:55,380
噉，主席，我相信雖然我哋唔係管曬咁多嘢，但係我哋都希望知道當局即係點樣去分配啲嘢嚇，令到啲誒表演團體都好安心，同埋到時出到嚟噉，陣間又有好多其他場地，即係點搞嘅咧？即係呢啲事咧，主席就算唔係今日傾咧，我都希望咧係會有。

251
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:15,390
個機會即係畀當局去解釋清楚，咁人哋西九文化局即係管理局，佢都想知㗎。你咁多談嘢喺度，同埋我想提埋咧，頭先講到嗰啲設施咧，即係好靚、好民、好民主啊，好好即係畀人想去。噉我希望就係個價錢咧都要係平民化，即係唔好搞到。

252
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:27,900
咧係冚唪係好超豪，呢個亦都係好緊要。咁但係講講嗰啲表演團體啊，嗰啲各方面嘅諮詢，誒大家而家嗰個溝通係點？係邊位可以答一答咧？好啊，誒邊位答一答？

253
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,940
啊，秘書長定係Mr.

254
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:52,440
Well, I'm happy to clearly on the the Kowloon complex. We're meeting with LCSD next week to discuss that issue. As we understand, it's a community. It's very much a set of community facilities that have been long discussed in Hong Kong, and we'll be having.

255
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:12,450
那些 conversations， until I've had those conversations， there's not much I can say about that. In regard to the progress and cost， we're clearly， as the chief secretary indicated to the committee at her last appearance， no cost containment is one of the significant issues for us and we've

256
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:21,910
We seem to be doing reasonably well on the two major projects so far. From that point of view, we're just about to

257
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:42,200
receive the final tenders for the park development, which we will hopefully have by the end of next week, and then we'll be making decisions over the coming months on that front.唔該曬，阿主席，我想問下秘書長咧，嗰啲場地嗰度咧，你冇理由叫西九去走去同你去統籌㗎。佢雖然當然傾偈。

258
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:54,910
仔梗係可以啦，但係咁多範疇，即係康文署佢哋管理，佢哋係咪會即係有一套嘢，知道係邊度係點樣用法？呢個話第二嚇各自為政咧。係，秘書長。

259
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:15,230
係，主席係，誒其實誒，我想即係首先畀一連立之生答先，我先再補充嚇。咁其實誒，而家香港有好多嘅表演團體啦，有好大嘅表演團體，好似我哋政府直接資助嘅，即係九大藝團啦，亦都有一啲政府間接資助嘅藝團，即係透過藝發局，亦都有好多係。

260
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:33,630
不受政府資助嘅藝團嚇，咁喺西九嚟講咧，因為有好多嘅新嘅場地係會即係落成嘅。咁嗱，呢九大藝團咧喺而家目前康文處嗰度咧，亦都係有一啲夥伴計劃，係即係同佢哋有某一種嘅所謂駐場嘅關係。

261
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:53,920
咁因此，佢哋九大藝團咧都好想知道，究竟第時喺西九各個場館落成咗之後，譬如話舞蹈啊、話劇啊、音樂啊等等，佢哋係咪可能都有某一種嘅駐場藝團，所謂駐場藝團嘅關係咧，即係同西九發生呢一種噉樣嘅關係嘅。咁呢一個咧，呢個噉樣嘅討論咧。

262
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:13,930
其實係係過去嘅一年咧，已經開始咗㗎啦。即係我哋係誒開過幾次會，即係同九泰藝團同埋其他藝團咧都傾過。咁因為西九嘅誒場地咧，唔係一下子就馬上係完全落成到嘅，咁都係分期噉樣進行。咁第一個誒就梗係戲曲啦，咁跟住就會有M plus，咁其他嘅。

263
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:33,940
表演場地咧，其實係冇咁快係會落成嘅。我而家睇緊都會係兩三年之後。咁因此咧，而家呢個時候，我哋已經開始咗一個都幾嚴肅嘅一個嘅對話㗎啦。即係同三方面嘅，就係即係同啲誒表演藝團啦、康文處咧，因為康文處管理好多嘅誒誒場地啦，同埋係西九嘅。咁當康文處係唔能

264
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:53,950
夠即係係去指令西九做啲乜嘢啦。咁大家要協調嘅，即係話誒第時香港主要嘅，譬如話即係管絃樂團，佢係唔係可以誒即係成為即係新嘅即係誒音樂廳嘅一個駐場嘅表演藝團咧？嗱，咁呢一個咧就要大家傾嘅，即係究竟誒咩叫駐場咧？係咪畀佢管理曬成個場地啊？

265
00:50:53,950 --> 00:51:13,960
亦或係由西九自己係管理呢個場地，但係係畀佢有一好大嘅程度嘅，即係節目上邊嘅調動咧，或者係幫佢預留好多嘅空間，即係嘅節目誒嘅空間畀佢咧。咁呢個幾個嘅方案咧，其實而家係喺度詳細噉樣考慮緊嘅。咁咧就我哋係誒有信心，即係佢。

266
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:33,970
誒開始之前咧，誒各方面嘅準備誒功夫咧會做足啦。咁頭先劉主劉議員提到，即係誒誒喺東九龍有一個觀塘嘅一個表演場地，我哋係積極噉樣係係係規劃緊嘅。咁呢一個咧係的確係非常之需要嘅一個社區嘅場地嚟嘅，因為咧誒大家見到喺西喺。

267
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:53,980
喺東九龍啊，即係包括觀塘誒，甚至係將軍澳，甚至係黃大仙、九龍城咁多個區，加埋百幾萬人咧。誒，其實而家係只係得個牛池灣嘅即係社區誒呢個誒表演中心，佢係好細嘅一個場地嚟嘅。咁誒，當區咧就已經係即係要求咗好耐，好耐。

268
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:13,990
即係政府係提供呢一個新嘅場館，咁亦都係以前市政局遺留落嚟嘅一個嘅即係承諾嚟嘅。噉我哋希望咧，希望盡快可以攞到即係嗰個資助誒個撥款咧，就可以真係興建到呢一個嘅即係表演嘅場館。咁當然呢個表演場館咧係喺東九龍嗰度。咁誒，我哋唔覺得係同即係西九。

269
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:34,000
有呢一套嘅即係誒表演場地咧，係有任何嘅直接嘅競爭啦，或者係有重疊嘅啊，因為佢都係面向誒呢一個誒地區嘅人士。當然佢都係一個誒，都係好合規格嘅表演場地，亦都可以係誒誒去誒誒處理到一啲即係專業嘅。

270
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:54,010
誒表演團體嘅邀嘅需求嘅嚇，咁所以呢個咧誒，亦都係幾年之後先至會落成。咁所以我哋覺得嗰個誒同西九係冇冇冇其他嘅衝衝突嘅嚇。O K，阿主席，我淨係話希望我哋下幾個月咧揾一個月有個議程傾呢樣。你聽個秘書長講咁長，我哋希望係好有規即。

271
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:07,130
有秩序噉樣去安排呢啲嘢，主席希望你睇下幾二三月。我非常同意，我都覺得要揾個時間咧，我哋西九同埋其他表演場地嗰個分工嗰個情況，同埋誒，頭先聽到好多講咧，係將。

272
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,670
誒戲劇同戲曲嗰啲表演場地係搣濕咗嘅。

273
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:31,960
你冇可能咧就做大戲咧，就去西灣河啊，去牛池灣劇場做嘅，即係你做得到都蝕蝕死你啦，得三百座位嚇噉，所以你一攏一堆咁擺埋落嚟咧，就唔係表示我哋場地一定足夠，而且有好多戲曲團體咧，佢仲要揾場地。噉我諗嗰個時間。

274
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:47,420
啊！我哋繼續嚇，即係詳細講下起谷中心同埋其他誒外邊嘅場地嗰個嗰個影誒，大家分配啊、協調啊等等咧，揾一個詳細一個一節咧，我哋係詳細傾咧，好嘛？咁下一位黃碧雲。

275
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,480
誒，多謝主席。

276
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,930
嗯，我主要想問一問關於嗰個啊。

277
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,240
文件嘅。

278
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,270
誒令。

279
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:09,660
零二號嗰個討論文件，誒，關於第五段同埋第十二段，我想請誒。

280
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,030
解釋一下咧，第五段咧就關於咧係誒戲曲中心。

281
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,670
咁咧就講緊咧係要誒。

282
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:23,370
節省嗰個嘅成本係大概一億。

283
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,390
咁喺呢個過程裏邊咧。

284
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,200
就係。

285
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,300
節省成本咧，主要咧就做咗幾樣嘢啦嚇。

286
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:39,710
咁咧就其中一樣咧，就係減少零售、餐飲、消閒設施嘅樓面面積。

287
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:52,700
噉我就唔係好明啦。咁因為咧，去到第十二段嘅時候，就講講緊個mind relaxation就要增加個blood vessel啊。

288
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,130
咁裏邊咧，又講咧。

289
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,810
要研究緊增加呢一個嘅用地嘅發展密度。

290
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:13,310
咁增加咗個發展密度咧，就可以用嚟用作其他文化藝術設施、零售餐飲消閒設施，以及酒店及辦公室住宅用途。

291
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,880
噉我唔明咧，就係究竟你哋係想減？

292
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:38,830
嗰啲餐飲啊、零售啊、消閒設施嘅面積啊，抑或係要加咧？咁點解第五段就講緊喺Empress嗰度為咗要慳錢咧，就要剁咗嗰啲零售餐飲設施？但係去到十二嘅時候，就成講緊成個西九嘅時候，你又要增加。

293
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:39,740
呢一個。

294
00:55:40,020 --> 00:56:00,030
地積比去create翻呢啲設呢啲面積咧，可唔可以解釋一下？Okay，thank you for your question. The issue is the plot ratio applies to the whole of the site across the cultural facilities, the OACF, the office residential space.

295
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:14,780
What we've done to contain part of the budget issues in regard to DSHU is that we've reduced by a small amount the retail dining entertainment facilities in the specific building.

296
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:35,070
But that does it. What we we are still looking at going for an increase of fifteen under a sixteen section sixteen application to the town planning board for the the totality of the facilities across the GFA of the whole of the site. So.

297
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:55,080
The issue in regard to ZHU doesn't have any relationship to the rest of it. Once we've built the other buildings, we would be expecting the component of RDE will be the maximum that we are able to get, because the importance of the RDE to the Westcarloon project is that that is what government has agreed.

298
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:15,090
是the the major income source for the organisation for running the venues and for running its activities. So there's no inherent contradiction between 0.5 in regard to ZHU and the reduction of RDE facilities and the overall increase in the level of RDE.

299
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:35,100
Facilities across the whole of the site. The RDE will be incorporated both in the cultural buildings, in the OACF buildings, and in the office and residential buildings across the whole of the site. And we will have to comply with whether we get the increase in the fifteen increase that we will be.

300
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:52,970
applying for in the early in the new year, we will still have to comply with the total amounts as laid down by the town planning board。主席，我覺得佢又答唔到個問題嘅，因為誒我問緊嘅就係你嗰度要減係同一類嘅嘢。

301
00:57:53,250 --> 00:58:13,260
你就喺大嘅成個西九嘅範圍裏邊，又加翻另一類嘢。你要諗下咧，就係城規會根據咩道理要接受你呢個申請咧？你係要證明有必須啊嘛。噉你如果你你認為有必須增加零售餐飲設施，咁點解你又drop咗原先嘅計劃裏邊喺Empress？

302
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:26,090
有嘅零售餐飲設施咧，你解釋唔到咧，你城規會你都可能過唔到嘅喎。好嘛，我畀一分鐘時間，阿餘生或者阿餘生先生，you have one minutes to explain this。

303
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,710
或者我可以解釋少少咧。

304
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:49,000
啊，點解會喺戲曲嗰度會減省呢個誒飲食消閒啊嗰啲咧？因為個劇戲曲嗰個設計咧，睇到咧中間有個中庭，然後再再升上去。噉我哋亦都問過我哋嘅誒在零售嘅專家睇過咧，就係嗰個efficiency嗰個誒使用率咧就低。

305
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:09,010
嘅喺上邊嗰個使用率低，咁如果我哋減省咗喺個位咧，其實我哋整體嘅全個區嘅誒，所以我哋叫RDE咧係冇冇冇轉變到，只係話嗰個建築物係咪可以？因為依個建築物主要都係喺誒戲曲嘅嘅設計上邊。如果你睇中庭上邊咧，如果你將佢擺到好高。

306
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:29,020
高咧，嗰個我哋叫evisions就低。噉我哋就就用睇過呢個之後咧，就減省咗嗰個。但係整體上，如果你睇翻嗰個誒零售咧，你發覺咧，其實地下地面啊嗰啲嘅嘅個效率咧係高嘅。噉我哋冇理由用用一間高嘅building咧，喺尤其喺A-trim咧嚟做。

307
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,300
好多啲LDE，咁呢個咧其實係個原因咧，我哋係減省咗嘅。

308
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,770
我諗，我都同阿黃議員一樣咧，都唔係好同意。

309
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:57,060
因為你，我諗都時間夠啦。我總結兩句啦。我諗呢個詳細我哋都要傾，因為你起谷中心零零丁丁嘅起咗先嘅，到時咧買杯嘢飲都冇地方飲，四圍都沙漠係嘛？你你自己原本有噉嘅設施嘅，你就話等第日先啦噉樣。咁第日就算有，你都可能十萬八千你要去。

310
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:11,140
要買杯汽水噉啊，撲到翻嚟開場啦。咁所以呢個我哋遲啲再傾啦。因為呢個係説服唔到我哋議員嘅，我諗我議員都同意，我哋要詳細再傾傾，即係呢度點樣呢啲設施點樣要用去。

311
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,850
啊，Empress一樣嘅啫，下下一位。

312
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:15,320
梁啊，副主席。

313
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,560
對。

314
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:31,030
誒，今日我睇呢個誒西九文化區管理局交嚟嗰個文件咧，就令到我諗起有誒，既然今年都係個新嘅開始啦，都講一講即係公民黨嘅關注。

315
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:35,340
首先，第一咧就誒，關於嗰個超支嗰度咧。

316
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,790
其實大家都知啦，而家有好多工程都超支嘅。

317
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,440
高鐵又超支。

318
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:47,120
誒中環灣仔繞道又超支，全部都以百億計嘅超支。

319
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:54,500
噉我就驚咧，而家搞一搞下咧，西九會唔會變成畫虎不成反類犬？

320
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:59,060
咁因為我哋始終當時係誒。

321
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:08,250
同意搞呢個項目嘅時候咧，都覺得要搞一個即係人民西九，將香港西翻喺世界嘅文化藝術版圖之上嘅。

322
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:15,900
咁如果咧最後造成嗰樣嘢咧，真係畫老虎變咗畫只狗咧，噉啊真係好差嘅。

323
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:36,700
咁所以就呢度咧，我覺得我哋係要同當局商榷一下㗎。咁主席當然明白啦，即係上次阿林鄭月娥司長作為呢個西九文物區管理局嘅主席嚟到咧，就承認超支，不過佢又講啦，講又講唔出會超支幾多。咁呢個亦都有個歷史包袱啦，當然。

324
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,820
就係即係佢嘅前前上一首啊！呢個唐英年咧。

325
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:56,880
就細神劈完喺立法會就話二百十六一日夠㗎啦咁啦，咁但係始終你都要放低呢個包袱㗎，我覺得。所以我或者同我好同意主席講咧，即係我哋既然今日都產生咗新嘅誒，即係一年嘅即係主席同埋副主席咧。

326
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:02,820
我哋係應該盡快咧，就約呢個民呢個呢個咩啊民政事務局。

327
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:19,500
就同呢個西九文化區管理局咧傾一傾，睇下我哋要從邊幾方面關注啦。咁當然頭先我講咗第一樣就係嗰個成本嘅控制嗰度，我哋都要攞到個平衡嘅，即係唔可以真係太過離譜啊！

328
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:23,740
咁第二樣比較大嘅關注咧，就係嗰個。

329
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:34,240
成規嗰度啦，即係第十二段嗰度個文件交嚟，同埋第十六段咧就講，即係佢會同好多持份者進行呢個溝通噉樣。

330
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:41,010
點解我將兩樣嘢拉埋一齊咧？因為我覺得成規呢樣嘢咧，就誒。

331
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:49,750
好多我哋估啦，我哋估啦，公民黨估計咧，即係喺附近嗰啲豪宅啊，就一定有好大聲音嘅。

332
01:02:50,350 --> 01:03:02,760
咁但係我你主席知道，公民黨一直都係話，即係呢個西九管文化區管理局條例第二十條嗰個諮詢會咧，其實係應該發揮一定作用嘅，即係令到一啲人咧，如果佢講嗰啲嘢啊～

333
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:23,050
係即係完全出於自私嘅，或者咧係真係好誒，即係唔得平衡嘅咧。你透過個公開嘅平台喺電視機面前講咧，可能佢唔敢講嘅。就算講咗咧，都覺得即係大家有眼睇有公論啦。咁所以我成日都覺得而家梁智仁教授咧。

334
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:41,700
醫生咧，佢就做咗個主席啦。我真係覺得呢度咧係要即係將嗰個諮詢委員會咧嗰個功能咧提升，成為一個咧真係公眾咧恆常參與不同持份者咧可以用佢嘅意見喺嗰度撞擊，畀大家睇到嘅一啲交流，至得。

335
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:50,030
咁第三個比較重要嘅，公民黨嘅關注咧，就係即係大家都記得㗎啦，即係嗰個公園嘅扶麗。

336
01:03:50,430 --> 01:04:10,440
因為嗱，而家就油尖旺區議會咧，就已經就趕絕咗嗰啲街頭表演㗎啦。噉就每星期開兩日，噉你擠咗幾百億咧，就嚟搞個西九文化區，跟住趕絕我哋嘅街頭藝人咧，咁咪好唔妥當啊！咁所以我就當然希望，另外關注咧，公民黨就係希望呢一個誒。

337
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,700
誒公園嗰啲扶例咧，係快啲搞得成，噉啊，令到我哋啲藝術家咧係有多啲表演嘅空間啦。

338
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:34,170
咁另外咧就係誒頭先都有同事提過，主席，即係譬如誒民政事務局、違法局、演藝學院、西九管理局呢幾個噉樣嘅組織啊，咁又大家管控唔同嘅資源。

339
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:41,720
咁究竟佢有幾多程度係重疊咗？應該點樣分配？誒，邊個管乜嘢？

340
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:52,000
咁呢個咧，我相信都係我哋公民黨嘅關注啊！最後因為時間有限啦，我講講講咧就係，即係我哋都覺得，即係教育係好緊要啊嘛，因為你。

341
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,940
教育即係從兩方面講啦，即係你係教育。

342
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:07,620
令到將來我哋嗰啲表演項目、藝術嘅項目咧係有觀眾啦。咁呢個真係中小學嘅課程㗎啦。另外一個教育咧就係你而家西九。

343
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:27,910
建構完成之後咧，呢個人民需求咧係需要好多人嘅，包括表演者咧，包括後台嘅啊呢個誒技術人員啦，包括藝評家啦、藝評人啦啊誒等等嘅配套啦噉，咁即係呢啲我就係用咗頭先大概五分。

344
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:47,920
中咧勾劃咗公民黨嘅關注咧，我哋都希望主席領導之下咧，我哋盡快可以同當局講一講，即係我哋從宏觀去去監察呢個項目嘅誒落實咧誒，應該我哋係喺今年之內啊，係點樣將呢啲咁題目係都可以適。

345
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,420
時地係有效嘅，喺呢個我哋嘅聯合調查委員會咧，係進行監察。

346
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:14,790
誒民政局有冇誒回應啊？嚇，簡短啲一分鐘。嗯，係誒主席就誒，因為頭先啊梁副主席即係都講咗好多比較大嘅即係課題嚇，噉我哋都好樂意即係就呢個項嘅課題咧，係再大家詳細噉樣溝通，有咩咩資料咧，我哋係盡量係去。

347
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:29,870
提供嘅嚇，咁誒，如果喺呢個時候即係都可以好簡短噉樣去回應咧，就誒誒梁主席都提到就話，即係嗰個誒超支嗰個問題嚇，噉我哋咧就其實係政府亦都公佈咗，就話我哋係會。

348
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:36,190
就嗰個地庫嗰個問題咧，我哋政府係承擔咧，係去係。

349
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:57,300
出資係做嗰個嘅地庫嘅，咁因為呢個咧都係一個誒，我哋個設計嘅時候啊已經定咗落嚟嘅一個嘅要求嚟嘅。咁呢個設計亦都即係大眾都好好接受嚇。咁如果做唔到個地庫咧，我哋其他嘅工程都好難即係去展開。咁因此咧，我哋有關即係呢個工程嗰個嘅撥款申請咧，我哋。

350
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:17,310
都會盡快係即係嚟翻呢個委員會啦，或誒同埋去即係公佈小組委員會咧，誒同埋財委會咧，係去申請即係撥款咧，係盡快去興建翻個地盤，等其他嘅工程都可以展開嘅嚇。咁誒，關於到關注到城規嗰個嘅程序，咁因為誒大家文件度都睇到，我哋都希望係若。

351
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:37,320
即係酌量噉樣去放寬翻，即係嗰個嘅地積比嘅。咁呢一個做法咧，其實喺好多嘅誒工程項目上邊咧，其實都有嘅。咁同埋城規會亦都容許，咁亦都做過嚇。咁所以一個少量嘅放寬咧，其實係誒我哋覺得係可以值得做嘅。咁城規會本身咧，其實佢都有。

352
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:52,430
有一個好公開透明嘅程序，我哋申請就算係即係第啊第十六條嘅一個嘅放寬都好啦，佢都係一個誒法定嘅程序，咁亦都係有公眾嘅即係參與係可以陳詞啊等等，咁城規會係會做一個獨立嘅一個審查嘅嚇。

353
01:07:52,740 --> 01:08:12,750
咁誒，另外就有關即係嗰個誒溝通方面咧，當然我哋嗰個嘅諮詢委員會咧已經係即係開始咗工作㗎啦。咁誒，上次喺度開完會之後咧，其實呢個諮詢委員會亦都係開咗一次會議，係傾咗幾個課題嘅。咁誒，肯定即係我諗誒誒，頭頭先梁主任提到嘅各樣嘢咧，誒，我諗諮詢委員會都係會樂意係去傾。

354
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:32,760
啦，咁誒，至於公園嗰個扶勵嚟講咧，就其實係誒，亦都會積極係去展開去做㗎啦。咁誒，都會參照翻即係政府嘅有關嘅扶勵。咁但係西九嗰個扶勵可以係一一套自己嘅扶勵嚟嘅。咁誒，點樣去容許喺呢個公眾嘅空間係誒做一啲街頭或者？

355
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,030
係露天嘅一個表演咧，係完全係可以做得到嘅。我哋覺得嚇。

356
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:57,320
誒咁至於話其他誒政府誒誒藝藝術文化方面嘅基建嘅其他嘅持份人同埋其他嘅誒成分咧之間，即係嗰個關係啊，同埋工作嗰個嘅誒關係咧誒資源嗰方面嘅分配咧誒，我哋其實都講過好多次嚇，噉我哋。

357
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:13,940
誒，如果大家見到係有問題嘅話咧，係儘量係可以提出嚟嘅。好多謝主席。好啊，噉啊，頭先阿梁議員講嗰幾個咧，我哋都睇下下。其實下一個我哋都徵詢大家要提啲咩意見，我哋喺適時喺邊睇下邊一節裏邊咧，我哋都包括嗰四點。

358
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:34,390
啊，或者其他各個議員自己嘅一啲提法咧，陣間再可以提出嚟。嗰主席，你可以盡快安排一個內部，即係我哋閉門會議啊，同佢哋定一定。好嘛，咁呢個誒同一個閉門會議傾傾，係嘛？冇問題嚇，冇問題嘅。不過就至於地庫嗰度咧，因為上次喺公務訴中我都提出啦，其實。

359
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:39,360
之前你而家就地庫自己抽出嚟話，你政府承擔啦。但係原本。

360
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,760
西九需唔需要承擔某啲地庫嘅地方咧？

361
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,720
需唔需要分攤咧？呢啲咧，我啊覺得咧要睇翻原本撥款畀西九嗰陣時。

362
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,370
嗰個文件。

363
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,590
亦話佢係完全exclusion。

364
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:13,100
誒排除於地庫係唔係佢做？如果當時佢冇講，或者當時已經係係喺佢裏邊嘅要做嘅嘢嘅時候咧，即使你政府好誒話需要有啲公共設施都係唔係佢嘅係自己嘅咧，我諗依個分攤啊等等，我諗要詳細大家一個討論啦，依依樣嘢。

365
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,360
咁下一位咧，就彭國威。

366
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:27,720
我對主席誒超支問題啊，公堂嘅使用啊，文化軟件嘅發展係我好關注啊，同其他同事一樣。不過跟住來問嘅問題，我相信其他同事誒。

367
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:48,010
誒較少問，但係我同樣地關注，因為呢個係一個視覺文化博物館嚇，即係亦都係有巨大文化涵義。誒，第一就我係好遲先收到啲圖啦。我想問一問翻喺呢個圖上邊咧，呢個係一個睇落去咧就除咗Amperus嘅博物館，另外仲有兩座係一個建築羣嚟嘅。噉你哋就我睇唔到其他嘅圖咧。

368
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,050
咧，你哋係用。

369
01:10:49,330 --> 01:11:09,340
電腦模擬咧，係將整個建築羣咧更加具體地係去表達得到出嚟，可唔可以補交呢啲資料，讓我哋知悉啦？第一點，第二點咧就我對上之前我都批評過呢個，我覺得係一個即係缺乏特色嘅一個嘅博物館嘅設計嚟，係一個好似我哋以前咁打封一個島吊。

370
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:29,350
轉嘅三號風球嘅一個島嘅P字，即係個T字嘅設計嚟嘅，即係噉樣。噉我關注嘅咧就係你之前同埋今次嘅圖咧，都有顯示到外觀上邊，即係你用咗好多雪白嘅顏色。外觀上邊到底呢一個噉樣嘅你哋嘅電腦模擬係咪準確地反映得到嗰個建築嘅風格個美學上邊？係咪整？

371
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:49,360
個建築羣裏邊係突顯咗，真係好似嘅圖噉樣顯示。仲有呢個圖上邊咧，誒嗰個好大嘅，即係我批評就係話，好似一個擺一個好大嘅平板電視或者屏幕電視喺一個嘅建築羣裏邊，上邊係一張畫嘅。你哋係咪會用projector，即係用投射，又或者係用某一啲嘅啊高新科技？

372
01:11:49,360 --> 01:12:09,370
嘅應用咧，係將一啲藝術品係投射咗喺呢個嘅建築物嘅外觀上邊。日頭係會咁做啊，夜晚會咁做啊，大時大節咁做啊，推廣某一啲嘅誒誒誒節目或者展覽嗰陣時先會咁做咧。可唔可以講多啲畀我哋嘅委員會知識咧？我

373
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:29,380
對特別有建築風格同埋嗰個美學上邊係非常之關注。頭先講外觀嗰度咧，其實我亦都睇唔到有啲咩好特別嘅，即係嘅設計係出咗嚟。最尾嗰一點咧，我亦都想批評埋咧，連個logo咧，我覺得我都覺得係做得唔好嘅，唔好意思。Empress呢個係唔legible，唔legible嘅意思係點？

374
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:49,390
點樣咧個price嗰度咧係睇唔到啊，下邊變咗一點嘅。你係強餵你哋為咗強化呢個島嘅T字嗰度咧，係即係其實喺呢度咧。我希望如果你哋能夠即係同你哋嘅designer再去講一講嘅話咧，即係用一啲黃金比例二比一噉樣，用一啲顏色可能一個黑一個棕灰噉樣去做嘅話咧，既係睇到個price係legible係。

375
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:56,340
讀到之餘嘅話咧，亦都強調咗你哋而家現有個設計咧，可唔可以做得好少少噉樣？係，多謝主席。

376
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:16,750
Absolutely. Well, Mr. Fan, you know I've previously disagreed with you in terms of our assessment of the architectural merits of the building, as have the jury of eminent people from Hong Kong and from the world. Now I accept your position that you don't like the.

377
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:36,760
Building, but we think the building is going to make a substantial contribution to world architecture in terms of museums. We think that it is most appropriate for the most complex site that we're building it on, in front of what I would say are some of the more ugly buildings that sit behind it.

378
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:56,770
I think the contrast between those buildings is clearly an important part of the decision to make the building work. I wouldn't take too much notice of the visual representation in regard to your issue on the typography. That's a work in progress.

379
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:16,780
from the design team, clearly, I think it's the people of Hong Kong who have taken to the notion of the typhoon three signal as something that makes it feel part of the local iconography. From our point of view.

380
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:36,790
We believe that the building itself is, you know, a really stand-out design. That it will work. That it will work within the budget constraints. That it will work on the site. And from our point of view, I think the decision made by the juries, by the government and by the West Kalim board in adopting that.

381
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:56,800
Design， clearly establishes the way forward。啊，主席，唔好意思，佢答唔到個問題。唔緊要，你有你嘅意見，我有我嘅意見。喺外觀上邊，外牆嘅顏色、用料點樣達至到你哋半透明嗰啲，你係答唔到呢個問題。呢個係咪一個建築羣？如果係一個建築羣，另外兩座嘅外觀係會點樣？如何地整合？我想你可唔可以畀？

382
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:16,810
資料，我哋係未批數出嚟。Well, we we have only designed two buildings at this point. One, the ZHUE, and the M Plus, which is in the process of design. We're about to finalise the competition for the arts pavilion in the park. We will resolve the design for the park over the course.

383
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:36,820
of the coming months, but as yet we have not moved to design any of the other buildings. Any of the representations of the other buildings on the site, the initial decisions made within the master planning of the site, and the adoption by West Kowloon and Hong Kong of the concept plan.

384
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:45,640
Now, in regard to your other question, we bearing in mind it is a museum of visual culture that.

385
01:15:45,930 --> 01:16:05,940
Media and multimedia photography and film are a concern of the museum. I think one of the issues that will be argued out through the design process will be whether the building itself can be used as some sort of screen for dissemination of artistic.

386
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:25,950
或whatever else you'll see from the building behind it, the ICC building, that on a nightly basis they use representation on the building as an integral part of selling the building, selling their programme and selling the activities within that. Clearly, one of the issues will be.

387
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:46,000
Can we make sense of the idea of the building being its fundamental purpose as a museum, but also something that contributes to the nightlife of of Hong Kong in terms of lighting and representation of what's happening both within the museum and with Hong Kong itself? Okay.

388
01:16:46,000 --> 01:17:06,010
噉啊！我諗誒，因為第二輪咧，或者我哋都會揾一個時間詳細咧傾下M Plus咧呢個誒展覽館同埋政府其他好似頭先提嗰個起高中心，政府其他嘅場地啊，嗰啲視覺藝術嗰啲分工啦，噉啊有誒可以今今年可以深入啲去。

389
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:09,880
逐個專題呢啲去去討論對業界嘅影響嚇。

390
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,880
下一位陳志全。

391
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:32,170
係多謝主席，我都係想跟進翻戲曲中心嗰個超支問題。即係之前個超支咁嚴重，咁政府就話唔會再再爆數㗎啦。咁今日文件嘅第五段咧就話佢進行咗一係列嘅措施啦，令到總成本係減省達一億港元嘅。咁可唔可以話畀我哋知係？

392
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:52,180
係咪即時話由廿七億減翻落去廿六億咧？嚇，跟住佢講住一紮措施啦。咁頭先，黃碧雲議員嘅觀察我都覺得係非常之好，但係我聽得明，我覺得會唔會就係誒，因為你超支噉，你要揾啲嘢嚟起少啲啦。噉你就將嗰個話誒。

393
01:17:52,180 --> 01:18:12,190
零售啊、餐飲啊、消閒嗰啲咁呢間就唔起，就撥咗出去出邊噉。下次第間隔離嗰間先起，咁咪可以減低咗個成本咯。係咪噉嘅？你畀我感覺就係噉嘅邏輯，因為你喺第十二段你係話想攞多啲起多啲㗎嘛。咁只不過係呢呢間超支，所以你就掹咗佢出嚟唔起。

394
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:32,200
住啦，即係路睇一個十個煲九個蓋咧，咪一路一路騰一路騰噉樣咯。會唔會係噉樣咧？誒，另外咧嗰啲措施有啲比較抽象嘅，譬如誒優化結構、外牆設計、有效運用樓面空間。咁呢呢幾個可唔可以詳細少少解釋畀我哋聽？你哋做咗啲咩功夫？噉啊，跟。

395
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:48,360
根據一個報道咧，就話其中一個即係為咗減省運作成本咧，就地面同埋一樓咧就只有通風系統嘅，噉啊一樓嗰啲商店同埋二樓先有冷氣嘅，咁呢個咧就導致呢個圓形平台會唔會好熱啊？即係熱到咧誒？

396
01:18:48,640 --> 01:19:08,650
炎夏咧就用唔到噉。如果係噉樣咧，會唔會反而嘥咗啲資源咧？即係真係抽糧咧，先至可以多人去用。咁呢個亦可以回應一下。另外就係誒預計呢個氣局中心係二零一六年會落成嘅。咁落成啫，呢個係咁正式啟用有冇時間表咧？幾時先至可以即係真係做大氣咧？

397
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:29,170
Okay，誒邊位答，唔好上嚟。嗯，Well，I I just take exception to the question of overspending。 The issue is not overspending。 The budget in the CC case in 2008 was 1.3 billion。 I've made it abundantly clear a number of times here that the construction cost index。

398
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:49,180
has risen 111% in Hong Kong. This was the first building. We agreed that the budget was agreed with government that the budget would be 2.7 billion for the ZHU Centre as the first building, and we are now doing everything in our power to contain the costs within that.

399
01:19:49,280 --> 01:20:09,290
In regard to the first contract we have let for the foundations, that work is underway. The major contract for construction, as indicated in the paper that you have, will be let in the first quarter of 2014, and we are obviously hopeful that the construction industry in Hong.

400
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:29,300
Hong Kong will be able to meet the demands that we set out in our construction contract. I have no difficulties with the design of the building. We have spent the last year working on the design with two eminent Hong Kong architects, being Tom and Ronald Liu.

401
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:49,440
They, you know, in terms of the building, it is also the major front door to the West Kalin cultural space. So the idea of public space is clearly an important part of this building, in that it is adjacent to Canton Road and it does connect to Austin Road and to the the new exit.

402
01:20:49,440 --> 01:21:09,450
SRL station，所以我唔 have any problems with the air conditioning， and there is no inherent contradiction between paragraph five in regard to the use of the spaces within ZHU and the reason why we are applying to the town planning board for an increase in regard to the overall plot.

403
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:24,530
ratio for the whole of the West Kowloon site, both the cultural facilities and the other commercial facilities. I hope that addresses your questions.好，咁咧就第一輪咧仲係冇同事舉手，係四分鐘完啦。

404
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:27,130
好嘛，係啊，陳主席。

405
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:39,140
係咪第一輪啊？冇錯啱，但係而家冇米有嘅，冇米冇米錯過九位，有有而家開始有啦，唔該曬。

406
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:57,600
就係誒嗱，誒主席，我咧就有幾個問題，我唔知前階段嗰度誒嘅情況如何問嘅時候，但我都想問下，因為而家咧就有個關心咧，即係認為誒牽涉到文化唔同嘅界別咧，都希望而家文化中心裏邊咧能夠放多啲嘢入去。

407
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:07,750
即係特別喺啲誒嗰個地積比嗰度咧，即係我聽文化界講，佢實可以加個半比，我就想問喺呢方面咧，就係誒。

408
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:24,820
點去評估呢個？我特別見到今日咧係民政局，即係有官員坐樹咧，我都希望睇睇。即係我知道呢方面佢哋在界別咧，係好期盼住相關啲建築物咧，係咪可以誒放寬個範圍？噉我想問呢個有係咪咁存在？

409
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:29,710
另外一個問題咧，就係話誒有關而家嗰個誒。

410
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:45,020
好多朋友都問我，即係而家係油尖區嗰度咧，就決定喺嗰個即係開放區嗰度啊，佢就改為星期六、星期日同埋假期，即係嗰啲表演藝術團體咧，唔關，唔係唔係唔係唔係唔係唔係。

411
01:22:45,300 --> 01:23:04,040
你誒誒，主席，我唔知你安排啲。不過我就想問，有啲人就問我能否喺而家文化呢個我哋呢個區域裏邊咧，將來有啲自然嘅表演區畀佢哋，令佢哋喺呢方面能夠更加有發揮。我先問兩個問題先，主席唔該。O K，誒民政局答一答啦，可唔可以增加地積比同埋？

412
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:24,350
都係地積比呢樣嘢。嗯，主席，頭先我答啊梁家傑議員嘅時候咧，都提到㗎啦嚇，就即係好多文件亦都講咗，就話其實西九係誒都有議員係想將嗰個誒西九成個西九嗰個地積比咧係略略增加嘅。略略增加係咩意思咧？即係一般嚟講喺誒城規會。

413
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:44,360
會即係嘅框架裏邊咧，弱為增加大概係可以誒百分之一十至到百分之二十，咁都可以叫做係少量嘅增加嘅嚇。咁誒西九誒管理局咧係有議員咧係係提出呢個申請啦，咁亦都會經過呢個城規會個公開個程序係去審核翻嘅。咁夠。

414
01:23:44,360 --> 01:24:04,370
究竟裏邊係會係增加啲咩設施咧？而係西九而家咧係喺度裏邊咧係係研究緊嘅。咁但係誒，大家可能都可能知道咧，原本嗰個嘅地積比率咧誒，政府即係話非西九同埋政府之間嗰個攤分咧，就其實係會係諗得差唔多一半一半到啦嚇。

415
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:24,470
咁即係話誒，如果增加咗誒百分之十或者十五嘅地積比咧，新增加嗰個部分咧，大約可能嗱，即係如果我哋真係跟翻原本嗰個分攤嘅話咧，係會係有翻即係誒一部分咧，係畀翻政府誒做一啲商業啊或者係住宅嘅樓宇啦，誒誒嘅地積啦，咁另外。

416
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:44,480
嗰啲咧就係畀西九咧係做西九嘅嘢啦。咁譬如話誒，即係誒藝藝術團體係希望有啲咩誒新嘅嘢放落去咧，亦都可以提出嚟嘅。咁但係誒西九肯定係會喺呢一方面咧係再諮詢，即係誒藝術團體究竟佢哋想見到呢啲新嘅誒地積比率。誒，秘書長，我就喺啲點算。

417
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:59,550
誒，你陣間另一個問題我留你第二輪先再問，我就想問你剛才話誒會考慮緊，咁呢個當然要誒上城區翻去另外呢度聽個意見啦。但係我覺得我想提一點就，我剛才聽你講你係想起啲住宅同商業。

418
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:19,890
我我剛才講文化界想喺裏邊做多啲嘢，噉你而家就去咗，係咪因為你驚將來營運上唔夠錢咧？我唔知噉，所以變咗就話誒，同出邊講嘅就係文化界想擺多啲入去，而家好多人想擺，冇辦法擺咗入去㗎嘛。例如你應該下一派先問你小龍館嗰個主席，我就想呢點跟進唔該。O K。

419
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:39,900
係啊，我我其實講翻就係成個西九咧，整個西九有一個分到幾多大疆圖嘅。但係你剛剛講嘅增加地積地積比，如果起樓同起商業，同我哋講文化界嗰個，因為原本嘅計劃都係有一部分係畀政府係去起樓嘅，嚇，呢啲我冇改過任何嘢。唔係，如果你增加地積比嘅範比撥咗啲起樓，我間只要你原來。

420
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:59,910
有呢啲內容咧，但係我增加就話你增加個地積比嚟擺咗起樓同商業，我就有啲緊張啊！你明我講呵？原本都係嘅，原本一點八嗰個地積比都係噉。如果你話增加百分之十咧，係唔係用翻呢一個即係比率嚟到增加翻咧？呢個其實係嗱，我就覺得我個人意見，我未聽誒業界意見。

421
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:19,920
我就聽到，如果增加百分之十或者十五當咗呢百分之十同埋十五嘅地積比，都應該擺翻文界界文化界，就按照你個原有辦比再攤分佢嗰辦比。O K，即係呢個我意思。嗯，好，主席，好咁咧，我諗呢個我哋揾個時間都誒傾嗰啲建誒建設嘅時候詳細咧睇一睇，如果去改變嗰個地積比嘅時候，我哋嘅。

422
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:39,930
又揾一節時間咧，睇下佢誒喺文化設施裏邊，或者佢誒政府自己嘅商業設施裏邊咧，睇下嗰個分攤點樣，好嘛？好主席啊，我強調一點，當佢上城規會前，佢一定上上翻嚟我哋小組咯。O.K.喺城規會之前咧，就一定有文件過嚟，我哋小組誒睇睇，好嘛？

423
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:43,120
係，Mr. Lin，你有一分鐘嚟到回覆先。

424
01:26:43,400 --> 01:27:03,410
Chairman, just on the final point of the Yau Tsim Mong pedestrian zone, I think members need to be aware that 23 hectares of the 40 hectares is public space. So the sooner we actually finish West Kowloon, the easier it will be for Yau Tsim Mong to manage the issues in regard to people being able to perform on the site.

425
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:03,790
係。

426
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:24,090
We have plenty of spaces where people will be able to perform, as long as we get the the parts of the building done, the building, the park and the public facilities. And we are as you clearly one of the reasons that we are inviting members of the committee to come to the Free Space Festival on the fourteen th.

427
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:44,100
15th of December is to see the huge range of activity by local artists and the various performers in different parts of the site, which I think will give you some taste of what the future will look like and take some of the pressure off Yau Ma Tei District Council.

428
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:55,380
OK，我哋夠鐘啦，好嘛？咁因為。

429
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:57,600
仲仲話冇第一輪嘅。

430
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,990
就如果冇咧，我就問第一輪問一個問題，問兩個問題。

431
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:19,360
第一個咧戲曲中心咧，即係我又無意去即係批評任何嗰啲建築嗰個形式啦，因為依個都係一個藝術創作啊，咁啲建築藝術我唔批評。但係我想問一下，因為戲曲中心頭先誒西九冇達到佢個內涵係點樣？

432
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:39,800
因為我睇到呢個咧就好先進啦，好似去咗科學館噉樣。究竟佢喺呢度同戲曲有咩嘅拉楞咧，同有佢有咩戲曲元素喺裏邊咧？因為個人入嚟去睇戲曲，你去到維也納去聽音誒opera睇opera，咁但係你要有啲噉嘅味道先得㗎。你唔可以去個科學館嗰度。

433
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:53,410
去睇依樣嘢，咁究竟佢有咩元素咧？第一係點？Amplus咧嗰個地積比係點樣咧？佢可用面積或者可展覽嘅面積嘅有幾多咧？可唔可以即係講畀我哋聽咧？多謝。

434
01:28:54,460 --> 01:29:14,470
Mr. Lynch, well, no, I disagree with you, Mr. Chairman, in regard to the design. The design has been come from extensive discussion with the Z-shu community. Eminent members of the Hong Kong Z-shu community have been involved in the design, working with two eminent Hong Kong architects.

435
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:34,480
It's not like a science museum, so I would take issue with you on that point. It clearly is designed with all of the requirements. Can you tell me what elements of the Chinese opera building or embedded in the

436
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,410
誒，design of the。

437
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,690
Construction.

438
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:58,190
Well, I'm not sure I quite understand the question. The theatre is designed as the best possible zhejiang and Cantonese opera performing space anywhere in the world, and that's been recognised by both the members of the jury who comprise the zhejiang community, including Lisa Wang and Frederick.

439
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:18,200
馬和馴蘇斐，他們是決定選定設計方案的人。明顯，茶樓是其中一個重要部分。更衣室、排練室都是為主要用途而設計。

440
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:38,210
Being Cantonese and Chinese opera, and that is very much reflected in all of the performing spaces. We cannot get away from the fact that this being the first building is also the front door to the West Kowloon Cultural District. So clearly, the issue of public space needs to be integrated.

441
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:48,000
Okay, maybe Mr. You can answer my question about the what elements of Chinese opera I view in here.

442
01:30:48,380 --> 01:31:08,390
誒，我簡單回應下喺個評審過程裏邊咧，誒戲曲界咧其實講得好清楚咧，佢唔要佢唔要一種傳統嘅老土嘅方法，亭台樓閣個方法嚟到呈現戲曲。佢好清楚噉話畀我哋聽咧，一個現代嘅當代。

443
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:28,400
嘅形象畀到年青嘅一代行入嚟呢個地方裏邊，佢唔會覺得係一啲誒好老土嘅事情即係落去。第二咧，佢哋會覺得咧喺一個戲曲嘅場館裏邊，戲曲嘅最重要嘅內容係呈現喺舞台上邊嘅，呈現喺舞台上邊最個。

444
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:48,410
集中要喺舞台上邊，所以我哋同戲曲界咧花咗好多時間嚟到諗啊，裏邊嘅設計嘅視線，同埋甚至而家喺度，我哋詳細咁諗嗰啲字幕嘅位置係點樣樣，好詳細咁睇呢一方面嘅內容嘅嘢。噉我希望議員都會清楚咧，就將來戲曲嘅最重要嘅呈現喺呢個標定裏邊咧。

445
01:31:48,410 --> 01:32:08,420
最重要係一個舞台上邊，而唔喺表面嘅喺出邊嘅嘅嘅形象嘅方面。咁呢個都係我哋一路同戲曲界係有一個好相當之好嘅一個默契同埋一個同意喺裏邊嘅。唔係我你都答唔到我問題。你可以用好新潮嘅方法，但係你唔可以話畀我聽呢個係冇呢個戲曲嘅element裏。

446
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:26,320
裏邊㗎嘛，即係你話係嗰啲人唔中意老土，但係你未話畀我聽啊。如果我用好新式嘅方法去表現去曲咯，但係係講唔到。即係總言之，我你你唔中意老土啊，噉我整個星空奇遇畀你咯。噉你入到嚟好似睇緊星空奇遇噉，不過係唱緊大戲。O K，冇問題，依個係你嘅答案。我我。

447
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,010
啊！我雖然我接受唔到，但係你都係你嘅答案啦。OK，好嘛？

448
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:42,160
誒，至於嗰個第二輪先再問啦，Amplus嗰度好嗎？唔想嘥大家時間。第二輪咧有蔣麗雲、黃碧雲、陳婉霞，再冇其他同事可以一路舉手。係副主席，蔣麗雲先。

449
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:51,890
唔該，主席。咁其實因為咧呢一個西九文化區咧，誒，第二輪都係四分鐘，係嘛？啊，唔得啦，唔得啦，係啦，誒。

450
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,940
兩分鐘啦，連問連答，精簡啲啊，大家。

451
01:32:55,890 --> 01:33:15,900
誒，其實咧就嗰個西九文化區咧，真係我哋即係九龍人咧嘅一個好重要、好關心嘅一個啊文化區同埋一個大公園。咁咧就誒，即係我唔我我啱啱都聽到有議員咧就希望建議咧，就同民政事務局嚇。

452
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:35,910
即係有一個啊，即係啊內部嘅會議傾一傾嚇，有關嘅財政問題啊，啊，日後嗰個管理問題啊，噉我諗咧就都可以傾一傾一啲發展誒發展同埋個設計方面嘅嘢，因為你始終咧就真除咗氣局中心個設計基本落實。

453
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:55,920
咗之外咧，噉啊，其他啲設計咧就都未開展嘅。咁所以，我覺得，因為我啱啱聽到，譬如一個Empress嗰個一個概念啦，我覺得咧，亦都好似係缺乏咗一個環保啊。噉你咁大棟嘅嘢係咪全啊全天候都要開住冷氣咧？係嘛？咁即係誒。

454
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:15,930
即係我睇到咧，就沿住海咧，你都好多building嘅而家，即係啊，差唔多都有。假如按白色嗰啲一棟棟咁計嘅話咧，哇！你真係十幾廿棟嘅嘅樓仔棟實曬喺嗰度，係咪？噉啊，即係我都想了解多啲咯，係咪？即係啊，因為而家我哋喺呢段時間淨係咁入。

455
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:35,940
問一答咧，即係大家個溝通都唔係好多，噉我都建議就係可以坐埋一齊去了解多啲。咁咧就因為我諗啊，呢一個係我哋即係全香港市民噉啊，對呢一個西九文化區嘅啊，落成啊，噉啊有好大嘅期望嘅。唔該，主席。

456
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,080
點解？

457
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:38,650
Mr. Lin.

458
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:59,180
Well, on the sustainability of all of our buildings, sustainability is one of the three core concepts on which the whole of West Kalin is predicated, and in particular with M Plus, part of the reason that Herzog and de Meuron and Farrells and Arup's won because of their advanced work in designing buildings that work.

459
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:19,190
從一個可持續性和環境的角度，我們最近收到環境局對未來西卡倫整體規劃的批准。所以，我不認為有任何疑慮關於建築物的環境可持續性。但顯然，我們非常開心，因為我們正在移動。

460
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:39,200
Through to the next sets of buildings to be able to help you address those issues. Clearly, the issue of district cooling and a number of other things are still issues that we're working on with government in terms of key infrastructure. But I can assure you that the M Plus is is going to be.

461
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:59,210
阿主席啊，其實得我好多謝你個回覆。咁即係其實我我認為咧，因為咧就係既然我哋有成立得一個西舊文化小組啦，有咁多大家嘅議員都關心，我諗多啲溝通多啲瞭解，總係一個好事嚟㗎嚇。譬如你啱啱你話好。

462
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:12,010
似個戲曲中心嘅設計，其實係佢內即係誒行內人嘅要求噉樣，噉我覺得係好事，係咪嚇？咁但係溝多啲溝通，點解唔得咧？係咪啊？好唔好啊？多啲瞭解啦，唔該。

463
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,250
嗯。

464
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:24,610
我好希望咧，就係誒西九管理局啦，同埋民政事務局啦，喺成個西九呢一個文化區嗰度，其實最緊要你要找緊時間。

465
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:30,910
走緊嗰個嘅budget嘅budget control，同埋嗰個quality control。

466
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:51,200
即係呢三樣嘢，即係個時間質素同埋嗰個會唔會超支？呢三樣嘢都係我哋好關心。咁所以其實頭先主席講即係批評戲曲中心啦，我就覺得而家批評就即係有少少過咗時咯。因為我其實喺上一次會議都見過嗰個圖㗎啦，即係嗰。

467
01:36:51,200 --> 01:37:11,210
個嗰嚿嘢，然後垂落嚟好似幕噉。噉我諗中唔中意咧，就可能有一千個人裏邊有人中意，有人唔中意。噉樣搞落去咧，你就起唔到㗎啦。咁所以，我覺得咧就即係稍為遲咗少少咯。噉我我我嘅睇法咧就係誒，我想問誒，有乜嘢困難係你哋而家遇到嘅？

468
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:24,750
令到你哋冇辦法預期，或者有可能係做唔到嗰個time management，係預期完成曬成個西九嘅文化區嘅建設。我想知嘅就係。

469
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:34,760
政府嗰個跨部門係咪喺你哋嘅工程各樣規劃裏邊畀到你哋足夠嘅支持咧？咁？

470
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:55,050
包括誒運防局有冇搞好附近嗰啲交通路嘅建設，係令到將來會塞車啦。或者你哋喺基建上邊，強務處啊，或者環保處啊等等，以及水路嘅連接有冇碼頭啊？誒，會唔會有船嘅供應啊？

471
01:37:55,050 --> 01:38:04,500
呢一啲有冇邊一啲部門係而家你哋係覺得佢係做緊拖慢到你哋嘅工程嘅咧？可唔可以話畀我哋知？

472
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:07,280
我諗。

473
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:27,910
去趕到大埔搞什麼嘢做？Do you want me to go for it? No, we're getting on very well with all departments, but clearly money, time, cost are big issues for us in terms of going forward. And clearly, we are hopeful that we will be able to deliver a fantastic part of the project by two thousand and twenty.

474
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:33,130
And the issue beyond 2020, I think, is is probably in the hands of this committee.

475
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:40,000
So, how confident you are to have it competed? I'm always very confident.

476
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,490
誒，下一位。

477
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:42,570
長遠啊！

478
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:54,250
好啊，唔該，主席。嗱，呢個咧就係誒文化界係一直好好關心嘅，特別係電影文化。咁咧就我諗過去好長時間，我同呢批人誒碰頭都問。

479
01:38:54,530 --> 01:39:14,540
好能夠代表香港呢部分嘅當中有一個即係人物咧，就叫李小龍。噉佢哋就嘅周圍都走揾去揾地方，佢想起李小龍館。噉啊，佢最近佢即係我見先出嚟講咧，林文輝出嚟講咧，佢就話喂西九咪可以畀我擺樹咧噉樣。即係自從九龍塘嗰個係告吹之後咧。

480
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:34,550
佢哋呢批人即係覺得好象徵香港嘅當年嘅一個電影文化，同埋佢嘅成個成功嘅過程，亦都好值得我哋大家去睇嘅。噉佢哋覺得係好希望有個地方話畀佢聽，得唔得？咁而最好咧就西九，佢哋話我今日再三問佢哋去做西九，我就想問咧，即係喺呢個時間，你哋會有？

481
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:54,560
會個思考咧？你話如果呢個西港我冇你份㗎啦，噉你擺喺邊度咧？

482
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:14,570
on West Kowloon, bearing in mind the development plan and the concept plans have all been approved. We would be, you know, we, I'm sure there are ways that we can try and honour Bruce Lee. But I think probably the issue of the museum for Bruce Lee, bearing in mind our focus is, you know, across all our four.

483
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,310
係嘅。

484
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:35,700
我我跟住我就話啦，實政策局有責任嘅。我同意你講嘅，即係如果去到呢個時候睇咧，我琴日都同佢講喂，人哋差唔多坐嘢定曬咯，你而家先睇噉樣。噉佢就話喂，我周圍講啦，佢政策局知㗎。當九龍塘唔得嘅時候，佢應該同我諗呢啲地方咧。嗱，佢大橋道你講嘅，咁今日兩兩門上比雪。

485
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:55,710
你都答答我哋，答答批好上香港呢個好有代表性人物，你坐落邊度咧？當時規劃時點解唔將你意念擺？既然九龍塘唔掂，都唔擺呢度咧？呢個我正要問咯，哦。O K，誒，我我想秘書長答幾句啊。嗯。誒，答幾句啦，嗬，卅秒。好啊，主席，係，我都好同意，即係香港，即係都應該要有一。

486
01:40:55,710 --> 01:41:15,720
個即係李小龍嘅館嘅嚇，咁但係即係我諗地方係一個問題啦嚇。咁但係咧就誒誒，其實政府都係已經成立咗喺呢個文化博物館咧一個都頗永久嘅一個展廳。你得五年啫誒嗱，你完全冇一個構思擺個在香港一個好重要即係等學理會一樣。

487
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:35,730
誒美國係即係人哋成個建設過程當中，唔係話誒誒誒過渡期啊，等等嘢嘛。啊啊！譬如嗱，我哋而家有一個嘅展館，都係幾幾長期嘅展館。噉我哋係咪真係五年之後係係要係要拆咗佢咧？我哋都未決定嘅。咁要睇一睇呢五年之內有冇其他嘅方案，我哋係可以去考慮啦。嚇咁呢個我都要同社會傾啦。嚇，你唔好壓緊。

488
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:47,430
我哋啦，係嘛？咁誒，我哋揾個時間再答啦。如果唔係，我哋講李書亮啦。唔想呃我嗰陣時，咁到時有冇咩？我係發覺啊，主持人頭先李司長咧就。

489
01:41:48,040 --> 01:42:08,050
誒略為答咗我嗰啲觀察，不過我我當當然相信佢都同意咧。我就應該盡快，即係好似其他嗰啲誒事務委員會噉樣咧，即係選咗新嘅主席出嚟咧，就梗係會就住嗰年嘅議程咧，就傾一傾睇下點樣鋪排嘅。噉我相信主席都會做啦。咁但係我想成日講講咩，畀啲。

490
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:11,280
想聽咧，即係譬如提及嗰個。

491
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:31,570
即係冇協調啦，即係好多正出多門，即係大家都搞文化藝術。就係其實我哋啱啱早幾個禮拜睇到報紙賣啫嘛，話起動九龍東嗰個辦事處咧就會誒，即係將嗰啲即係佢嗰個範圍，佢個嗰啲管轄嘅範圍裏邊，唔知天橋底定咩？

492
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:38,110
咧就會話要用有成八萬五千誒尺嘅。

493
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:58,450
地方就要使二千萬落去，就要搞做表演場地噉樣。咁因為你你其實其他嘢都係啫嘛，即係你啲錢點樣分分配啊？究竟係即係貴局係管幾多啊？幾多嘢係畀西九文化管理局揸fit㗎噉，即係噉嘅問題。即係我諗呢個都唔可以今日解決。不過我諗遲啲主席領導。

494
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:18,460
之下，我哋會講一講睇下點樣排喺邊度講啦。咁同埋我講嗰個諮詢會咧，其實就因為你都睇翻啲文獻都知道，我哋喺西班牙取經啊嘛，係嗰個Metropolis Thirty嘛。咁嗰個咧，其實個好處咧就噉，你唔係淨係話今次你放寬嗰條地積比，你係有個公聽。

495
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:24,040
會我知，咁但係你譬如不同嘅嗰啲誒藝術。

496
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:35,880
文化界佢點樣去誒？大家國力去搞個場地嗰啲，唔可以去城規會講啊嘛！噉你所以你一定要搞個諮詢會畀佢哋講嘅。

497
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:56,170
咁所以主席，我諗就咁啦。即係至於你話嗰個戲出戲曲中心咧，就我覺得噉。即係而家啲龜苓膏咧都有即食麪包裝㗎啦，咁即係係唔怪嘅。即係可能即係啲戲曲界係覺得有啲要創意㗎嘛，噉啊追上時代。不過我諗我都係即係誒期望主席盡快即係同佢哋。

498
01:43:56,170 --> 01:44:06,770
一齊約個時間，就將我哋啲議員嘅關注咧，就鋪排咗喺我哋嘅全年嘅議程嗰度，一一去誒釐清佢啦嚇。好。

499
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:27,170
無需答覆啦嘛，唔使啦，唔使答。O K，噉啊，我有少少嘅意見嚇，講講埋先。第一咧，我都黃碧雲唔喺度咧，其實我唔係想批評你哋個設計，只不過話我想知道佢有啲咩元素喺你嗰個設計裏邊。但係你話咧，因為諮詢咗業界，我唔需要老土，我要噉你呢個。

500
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:41,090
反傳統冇問題，但係你都講唔到裏邊有咩元素，只不過就係你原來就係冇戲曲界元素嘅嘅場館就係戲曲中心啦。咁噉你噉樣講法咧，就可能。

501
01:44:41,400 --> 01:45:01,410
誒，我都唔敢批評你哋嗰個程度個個誒設計程個個水平啦。我即係話你就算冇誒，即係反傳統，用最新潮嘅方法，你都可以有戲曲嘅元素㗎嘛。不過你做唔到得啦，我知道你哋做唔到。下一個，我想補充。

502
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:16,510
翻睇Empas，我上一次問個問題，咁個地積比點咧？可以做展覽嘅有幾多個場館、場地或者場館，同埋佢嗰個佔個比例有幾多面積咧？嚇，佔大全部嘅面積，係打一打。

503
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:20,460
第二道emplacer。

504
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:40,750
Chairman, we have the pie chart here, which I showed earlier also, and the number of galleries still depends on how if we'll have many small or fewer large ones, and probably there will also be flexibility, so you can actually change over time between larger and smaller galleries.

505
01:45:40,750 --> 01:46:00,760
But if you look at the pie chart, it's quite clear that the area saying display galleries is between a quarter and a third of the entire space, and that is roughly 15,000 square metres. To that comes also the auditoriums and the film.

506
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:12,540
Screening areas which are now fit into the general public spaces area, and of course the learning spaces, which also will be spaces for display of art.

507
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:32,850
I think in all public areas, when you move around in the building, you will see art, design and architecture and installations by artists. So it's a very generous space. Some very specific. We are in discussions now with experts in the ink art field to create a unique new kind of ink art.

508
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:42,230
Gallery, which will I think bring forward the ability to show ink art, for example, also in a contemporary context.

509
01:46:42,550 --> 01:47:02,560
O.K.咁咧就我諗咧，詳細嘅資料，我哋專題講Amplas同埋其他視覺藝術嘅領域嘅時候咧，你最好畀一個詳細嘅地方，因為你個Amplas用咁多錢係，如果你嗰個display area咁細，嗰啲展展嘅地方咁細咧，噉係咪值咧？

510
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:11,420
咧噉樣，我諗起將來我哋有誒安排咗有咩節數傾一傾，再傾啦，好嘛？仲有冇提問提？

511
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:32,120
會唔會有時候有多啲資料補充？定？好嘛？你而家我，我咧而家問啦。我唔係我，我就係話頭先我第一輪問嗰啲問題，希望佢哋可唔可以喺會後提供多啲嘅資料畀我哋嘅委員會參考，無論係嚇文字或者圖像係嚇。誒，範國威認為佢未答嗰啲，你會後再補充啦。另外。

512
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:52,130
頭先黃卓碧雲都通知我話，希望咧你將呢個powerpoint咧都傳畀我哋各個委員啦，同埋我想問嗰啲，我哋唔係想你哋訴諸於權威，透過咩程序做咗咩決定？好似主席咁問問你做嗰啲決定或者問嗰啲元素嗰陣時，你哋能夠解釋得到。而嗰個解釋係要喺未來日子裡。

513
01:47:52,130 --> 01:48:12,140
病公開同市民交到得到，唔係因為要怕以前老土，而係話可能要推陳出新，結合現代同埋傳統噉樣。應該呢啲嘅講法，即係嗰啲嗰啲嘅嘅元素係啲乜嘢嘅設計係代表咩概念？頭先我講嗰個外牆上邊用啲咩物料點樣，即係更加準確地畀我哋知道，而唔係去到最尾成個建築物。

514
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:32,150
設計咗出嚟之後，同我哋而家收到嘅資料有好大落差，我唔想見到呢個情況。多謝主席。嗱，我哋咧就討論呢個文件就。Do I get a chance to answer the question, Mr. Chairman？誒，我諗佢想提出話，你下一即係畀多啲資料啫。噉我哋仲有好detail講每一個項目講嘅。

515
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:52,160
唔使而家呢度即係解釋曬，我哋清楚曬嚇咁誒。Well, Mr. Chairman, could I just at least answer the question in regard to M plus? The M plus prescription for the museum was laid down many years before any of us were involved with West Kaloon by the museum, the original museum committee, which

516
01:48:52,160 --> 01:49:12,170
Comprised all of the major figures in the in the visual arts in Hong Kong. They laid down the prescription of what the museum would be. It was chaired by Victor Lo. It's still chaired by Victor Lo. It still comprises on the M Plus committee major representatives of the visual arts in Hong Kong.

517
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:32,180
There is a continuity that I think the the committee needs to bear in mind between where the project came from. Okay，多謝你嚇。噉我哋咧，因為時間就已經好緊張啦。咁咧，我哋仲要延長五分鐘，大家唔反對的話嚇，咁誒，我諗咧就唔繼續去討論呢個文件啦。噉我哋下一個。

518
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:36,920
個文件咧，就想講一講咧，就係話咧，誒。

519
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:38,530
我。

520
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:39,770
咩事啊？

521
01:49:43,650 --> 01:50:03,660
關心呢一個啊，啲議員非常之關心呢一個西九文化區嘅發展，好唔好噉樣？我哋啊，不如安排一次咁咧，去呢個啊拜訪佢哋，噉我哋咧就能夠同佢交流更多，瞭解更多嘅情況。咁日後咧，我哋有啲咩意見嘅話提。

522
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:23,670
出都係公道啦，係嘛？特選你做主席，主席想講呢句説話，你都講埋啦。噉我哋咧就希誒同西九文化區咧秘書處已經誒安排咗咧，睇下十二十七號上晝，噉啊，大家都睇下抽個時間咧，我哋實地去誒睇睇，同埋喺嗰度交流。如果大家唔反對的話咧，我哋。

523
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:43,680
開放畀全個誒立法會嘅議員，佢都去參即係參加埋我哋個小組嘅實地參觀，好唔好啊？阿陳主席，你有咩講啊？冇嘢誒，我我誒，我就誒一個強調日子啫。我諗秘書處會再通知我哋嘅。另外，我我係講定我一樣嘢嘅，因為我係關心唔講。

524
01:50:43,680 --> 01:51:03,690
但係，我想講一樣就希望主席你點跟進。就剛才梁家傑都講咗，就話要將我哋未來討論咧。我想提出個問題，有個地積比嘅問題啊。我我我聽唔到個地積比，所以我都會好跟進咁咧。我覺得應該擺前啲，因為地積比牽涉到佢當佢就有成個規劃嘅時候咧。我哋嘅聲音前啲，因為始終好多人關心。

525
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:23,700
咁呢個增加地積比到一點，好嘛？唔該。你講嘅嘢咧，睇下我哋次會期都會傾嘅啦。OK，好。咁但係咧，誒，我哋都會同呢個誒民政局啦、西九咧，我哋都會傾一傾咧。我哋以後嘅議程，亦都歡迎各位委員。如果你有啲乜嘢idea咧，有啲咩意念想講嘅咧，關於西九文化。

526
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:33,180
區咧可以畀秘書，我哋咧就加埋落去，或者係增加我哋嘅議程，好冇啊？啊，Miss Lin。

527
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:54,840
which is on the 14th and the 15th of December. If any members of the committee are able to come down at some point, I think it would give you a very interesting pre-information prior to the visit of the Leduco members on the 17th. And we're very happy to be able to know.

528
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:14,850
organise the appropriate arrangements for for that sort of visit before we do the visit on the 17th. Okay, okay.咁咧就下次我哋嘅會議咧就喺一月，初步計劃喺一月舉行。咁咧就會傾呢個小型藝術展館嘅進展同埋誒放寬西九文化區嘅發展。

529
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:27,390
密度即係頭先講個地積地積比啦，好嘛？咁咧，我哋下個下次會期就會傾。咁另外咧，就十七號咧，我哋就就就去參觀。噉啊，陳永行，仲有冇其他嘢？有。

530
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:40,130
因為我剛才誒嗱，我我覺得可能我哋有啲嘢睇漏咗啦。因為誒對於嗰個誒成個將來擺啲硬件嘅嘢咧，噉就誒我哋可能曾經畀過我哋嘅。

531
01:52:40,410 --> 01:53:00,420
我就覺得當然可能有啲嘢誒，如果落曬地基，我哋就好難㗎啦。如果唔係嘅話咧，如果作為我自己嘅，嗱我自己，我講純粹自己對誒西金文化唔緊要啦，依啲你咁個design嗰度咧，我就想講design，即係每個建築物design係咪全部落已經係好唔好？你誒即係。

532
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:20,430
話畀我哋秘書有有啲咩要講，我一定會加入去。另外咧，我都除咗呢個powerpoint咧，我頭先同秘書講咧，因為我哋呢度都好多新嘅嘉義員啦，咁咧就訪問西班牙嗰時，我哋有啲咩得著咧，我哋可能都唔係好清晰，咁可唔可以咧？秘書都重新將如果將當時嘅soft copy嘅文件咧，就

533
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:30,470
傳一次畀我哋，咁等我哋咧就多啲誒瞭解到啊！我哋即係成前睇後啦，有咩好做好嘛？多謝大家，今日會議結束。
