1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,010
順我哋誒，而家到咗誒開會嘅預定嘅時間啦，開始嘅時間亦都有足夠嘅誒委員在席啦。今日嘅會議嘅議程上面咧，有三項政府提交嘅撥款建議，有待小組委員會處理。我提醒委員，假如。

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:30,370
委員就今日會議嘅討論項目有直接或間接金錢利益嘅話，請委員按照議事規則第八十三A條嘅規定。

3
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,510
喺該事宜發言之前，披露有關利益嘅性質。

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:46,100
我亦都請委員注意《議事規則》第八十四條有關喺有直接金錢利益嘅情況下表決嘅規定。

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,560
我哋而家進入咧，係今日嘅。

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:09,970
第一個項目總目七零三建築物文件P W S C二零一五一六三二七二R S啟德體育園區呢份文件建議將二七二R S號工程計劃嘅一部分提升為甲級，按付款當日價格計算。

7
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:29,980
估計所需費用係六千二百七十萬元。政府曾經喺二零一四年一月十號同埋二月十七號就已議工程諮詢民政事務委員會，委員不反對政府當局將有關嘅撥款建議提交本小組委員會考慮。按委員。

8
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:49,990
要求政府已經喺二零一四年五月九號向事務委員會提交項目嘅補充資料。事務委員會嘅討論要點報告亦都喺大家嘅席上出席會議答覆委員提問嘅公職人員有嚟自民政事務局建築處。

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,460
我或者係咪先請民政事務局嘅副秘書長麥敬廉先生簡介下項目？

10
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,950
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning. Good morning.

11
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:15,370
The multi-purpose sports complex project at Kai Tak is intended to provide high-quality multi-purpose sports and recreation venues for the Hong Kong people, including a main stadium, a public sports ground and an indoor sports centre.

12
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:24,530
這些設施將不僅提供新場地來舉辦大型運動賽事，還將增加公共運動設施的供應。

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,670
The complex will also have office and commercial space, an extensive open space and park features.

14
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:42,520
And as well as providing a much-needed boost to Hong Kong's sporting infrastructure, the project will also play a major part in the regeneration and revitalisation of East Kowloon.

15
00:02:43,700 --> 00:03:03,710
After a considerable amount of time spent on planning this project, we are now in a position to invite members of this subcommittee to recommend to the finance committee the upgrading of a part of 272 RS to allow us to start pre-construction work on this project. The estimated cost of this work is 62.

16
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,640
700萬美元，以當天的價格。

17
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:20,020
The proposed pre-construction work, very very briefly, include a technical services consultancy, a quantity surveying consultancy, ground investigation, utility mapping, topographic and tree surveys.

18
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:36,790
As with other major works projects, we need to carry out pre-construction work in order to ensure that the key technical and planning considerations related to the project are clearly identified and resolved prior to going to the tendering and construction stages.

19
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:53,440
作為主席剛剛所提到的，我們定期向Legco委員會就本項目進行簡報，最近一次是在今年2月6日。委員會支持繼續進行本項目，並提出此撥款申請給公共工程小組委員會審議。

20
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:13,730
我們亦都維持與業界人士密切諮詢，包括在運動界，以及區議會，特別是東區、九龍城、九龍城、屯門和觀塘，以及海濱發展委員會的海濱工作小組。所有這些業界人士都支持這個計劃，並要求我們及早開始這個計劃。

21
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:34,180
subject to the funding approval of the Ledgeco Finance Committee, we plan to commence the pre-construction work in the second or third quarter of 2015 for completion in early 2017. Chairman, my colleagues and I would be very happy to address any concerns that members may wish to raise. Thank you, Deputy Secretary.

22
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:43,840
放呢個項目咧，係誒畀大家誒提問嘅。啊，第一位梁國雄委員，梁議員，早晨，主席，早晨。

23
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,420
我對梁姐冇信心，所以對呢個梁姐政府冇信心。

24
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,660
所以對梁振英政府講出嚟嘅嘢好冇信心，尤其是。

25
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,900
梁振英政府係。

26
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,260
跟住阿曾蔭權政府去做嘅九尾綫雕，更加冇信心。

27
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
嗱。

28
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,480
我就認為咧，呢一個啟德體育園咧已經係飽歷滄桑㗎啦。我而家就問一個問題啦。

29
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,410
就係嗱，原本設計呢一個。

30
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,310
啟德體育園嘅時候咧。

31
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,640
嗰度咧就冇乜嘢誒。

32
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,830
民居嘅，咁而家你起咗好多村喺度，呢個啊應該係傑哥嘅主席嘅選區嚟嘅。

33
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:38,780
係嘛？應該係傳。嗰度唔係唔係啊，隔離隔離嚟㗎哦，係哦，咁唔關你事啦。嗱，嗰度唔好咁講，全香港都關我事啊！梁宇如，請你繼續。

34
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:48,890
誒嗰度咧，而家已經失即係朝頭早我起身去翻工嘅時候咧，見到啲人咧熙來攘往喺度，即係好辛苦啊！

35
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,270
因為揾車搭嗱，噉你而家仲要整多啲人去。

36
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,780
你有咁多，即係好似而家我哋不嬲都噉嘅，成日都話：哎呀，香港唔掂啊！

37
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,490
咁但係咧，我哋又起多啲路咧，等第二啲人，即係喺其他嘅流動人口嚟香港活動。

38
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:14,120
咁而家你有咩善法去解，即係解決呢個問題咧？即係話你初頭喺你本來嘅計劃裏邊，其實你有冇諗過？

39
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,890
啟晴邨嗰度咧，其實會有好龐大嘅人口。

40
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,980
係喺度活動，咁而有由於噉嘅時候咧，你哋有冇足夠嘅配套嘅措施去應付呢啲嘢嘅咧？

41
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,280
嗱，呢個第一個啦，第二個咧就。

42
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,490
誒。

43
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,790
我真係冇乜信心，成分嘅撥款申請文件咧都冇提及。

44
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,270
誒啟德體育園區嘅面積嘅。

45
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,200
即係做咗幾多？噉你以前嘅文件咧，就話咧，應該大約係。

46
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,620
廿八公頃多啲啦，咁而家係幾多公頃咧？

47
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,900
誒唔該，你答一答啦。誒，畀啲時間你答，好冇先生。

48
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:17,250
Thank you, Chairman. Just very quickly on the second point raised by the honourable member, the area remains at about 28 hectares for the development of this complex as a whole. In respect of the first question, and in particular in regard to the traffic considerations, the transportation considerations, the new complex will be well.

49
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:37,260
由新MTRC Link，which is going to go from Shatin to Central， there will be two MTRC stations within approximately eight hundred metres of the complex. One at the future Kai Tak station and one at the future Tsung Wong Toi station. We have done extensive preliminary modelling on

50
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:57,270
The people flow on the assumption that the events at the main stadium in the complex would draw a capacity crowd of 50,000 people, and we have actually planned the existing indicative layout of the complex to ensure that these people can be effectively dispersed mostly towards the two MTR stations. Our assumption is.

51
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:17,290
That roughly 80% of a crowd of 50,000 going to a major event, be it a concert or a sporting event, would use the two MTR stations either to travel north back towards the New Territories or towards the rest of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. We are not providing for very extensive car or coach parking as part of this project. Our intention

52
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:33,240
是，這應該是一個主要可步行的項目，非常容易對大多數人來説。我們知道交通問題，這也是被特別由區議會提出的。然而，我相信他們對我們的回應感到滿意。

53
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,290
梁宇，誒呢個係一個呢個其實一個估計嚟嘅，你有冇吸收到機鐵嘅經驗咧？機鐵嗰日都話。

54
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:54,390
誒機場如果誒個客運量上升咧，機鐵咧就會客運量上升嘅。咁而家果然咧，你即係話你話初頭諗住揾啲人去搭搭鐵路去機場㗎嘛，而家唔係喎。

55
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:05,580
即係呢個係一個玫瑰園計劃係香港核心工程裏邊做出嚟嘅嘢。而家嗰條鐵路變咗係我哋每人要畀錢去補貼佢嘅，你有冇吸收嘅經驗咧？

56
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:26,090
Secretary, Chairman, I just very quickly answer that we are in constant consultation with the MTRC on this project, and we have also been engaging with them on the detailed station design for the two stations closest to the complex. Because we are aware that this is an issue, although I would think there are perhaps not direct comparisons with the airport.

57
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,250
It is something that we will take into consideration.

58
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,230
下一位，王國興宇。

59
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,770
多謝主席。

60
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:40,890
主席，誒對於呢個啟德體育園誒呢個噉樣嘅文件咧，我係全力支持嘅。

61
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:51,500
誒個理由係乜嘢咧？就當然咧，政府亦都交代咗咧，係諮詢過相關嘅區議會，係體育界、體育團體。

62
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,630
其實咧就過往咧，誒政府。

63
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:05,730
當然，我講係上屆，誒或者係前屆，誒想搞呢個大型嘅國際性嘅體育盛事咧。

64
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,570
嚟到立法會咧，就係挖鐵路。

65
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:18,210
其中挖鐵路一個原因咧，就批評政府咧，就係冇一個長遠嘅誒呢一個規劃。

66
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,760
尤其是咧，對於大型體育設施，就係講咧呢個配備不足。

67
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,020
以噉樣嘅理由咧，嚟去反對政府嚟去舉辦咧國際性嘅體育盛事。

68
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,080
我相信，如果大家唔係善忘咧，係記憶猶新嘅。

69
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:51,790
咁政府終於咧係接納咗立法會嘅意見，亦都考慮到體育界嘅意見，咁咧嚟去進行呢一個體育設施嘅規劃。

70
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,630
喺啟德呢一個咁好嘅誒土地上面。

71
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:15,190
誒機場搬咗，有一個咁好嘅空間，令到政府咧係可以興建一個規模比較宏大嘅體育園。咁呢一個咧係呼市民嘅期望，亦都係回應咗立法會嘅訴求。

72
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:25,270
所以咧，我認為咧，呢個唔係淨係當區嘅事，亦都係全港市民嘅事嚟嘅，係值得支持嘅。

73
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:40,180
我認為咧就係誒有啲人咧，佢要反對政府咧，就政府做咩嘢佢都係反對㗎啦，做乜嘢佢都係冇信心㗎啦，因為佢係反對派啊嘛，所以絕不出奇。

74
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,850
因此咧，我係全力支持咧呢一份文件，無需要政府回答。

75
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,000
哦，你唔係要答。

76
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,540
Mr. Mackinnon。

77
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,540
下一位，譚志明議員。啊，多謝主席。

78
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:17,800
誒，我都係關注嗰個嘅誒疏散嗰個問題。咁誒，頭先啊梁國雄議員都問咗啊，副秘書長都答咗一部分嗱。噉我睇到誒誒誒官方畀嘅答案咧，就話估計咧有八成嘅觀眾咧將會坐地鐵。頭先啊啊副秘書長都係咁講。

79
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:36,190
咁咧就估計三十分鐘內咧係可以離開個體育館，就去到地鐵站。嗱，呢個説話咧就相當隱晦嘅呢個嘢啊。去到地鐵站咧，唔代表你上個車啊。咁咧就誒，我假設你要落離開個場館十五分鐘，行到去地鐵站六百幾公尺。

80
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,280
一架列車咧，如果係全個空車度等咧，一卡一架列車載二千五百人。

81
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,150
啊，噉啊，大概咧就晚上呢啲非繁忙時間，除非有特殊安排，如果唔係咧，三至四分鐘一班車，最得閑到。

82
00:12:50,430 --> 00:13:10,440
最後上車嗰個講緊要等一個鐘頭，至少啊噉，所以即係呢個我想搞清楚咧。咁即係話，如果我係喺個場館最後一個落嚟，我十五分咁已經要半個鐘頭去到呢個呢個地鐵站範圍啦。但係我要等起碼四十五分鐘先上到車嗱。噉我想問，即係除咗呢個地鐵。

83
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:25,850
之外，你哋仲嗱，當然我都明白，你哋唔想擺太多私家車嘅泊位嗰度。咁但係咧，有冇其他嘅一啲交通交匯處咧，係畀其他嘅公共交通工具，包括巴士、包括小巴，可以提供一啲服務協助疏散人羣咧？

84
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,860
副秘書長。

85
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,560
Yes, thank you, Chairman. The

86
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:50,940
Investigations that I referred to just now, in terms of the crowd dispersal, of course, at this stage are of quite a preliminary nature. One of the reasons we're here today is seeking funding for the detailed pre-construction consultancies on technical and operational issues, and these consultancies will go into far greater detail on the exact mechanics of how the people.

87
00:13:50,940 --> 00:14:10,950
People will move from the main stadium, in particular, to the two MTR stations. However, the preliminary work we've done does show that with the indicative layout that we have, in particular with the podium structure that we are using for the easy pedestrian access to the stations, we are fairly confident that at least from our initial studies, we can.

88
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:22,990
Achieve those those aims. In terms of the other transportation infrastructure, perhaps I can ask my colleague just to very briefly explain what the other options are for people coming to and from the the main complex.

89
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:45,080
邊一位啊？係哦，好啊，啊，羅麗丹女士。係多多謝誒易志源嘅誒問題。噉就誒其實我哋喺啊過去做一個準備功夫嗰陣時咧，都誒第一講咗個地講少少地鐵先啦。噉就我哋係同地鐵係有好緊密嘅溝通嘅。噉佢嗰個列車嘅密度啊，同埋

90
00:14:45,080 --> 00:15:05,090
個列車嘅長度到底幾多卡車咧？我哋都係充分同佢即係溝通。咁地鐵咧就不嬲表示有大型event嗰陣時咧，佢個交通係有會有特別嘅安排。位大家都知道，譬如話係馬場散場嗰陣時，誒即係兩三萬人，甚至到咗誒新新年嗰陣時睇賀歲波，更加多到五六萬人都會從阿沙田馬場散場，利用地鐵嗰。

91
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:25,100
個網絡咧係疏上到全港各地，咁同時都喺其他交通方面誒工具方面咧，其實咧喺呢個地鐵誒隔離大概五十米左右嘅地方咧，其實有一個交通交匯處嘅，就係基本上就係巴士、小巴嘅交通交匯處。噉就我哋相信咧，就就暫而家就仲係under即係仲係誒，即係個誒規劃階段啦。

92
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:33,220
咁呢一個交通交匯處咧，會喺其他嘅路面交通咧，係提供咧誒，畀人羣疏散一個誒一個一個輔助地鐵嘅疏散嘅功用。

93
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:53,560
譯志明議員，好啊。誒嗱，多謝個資料先啦。不過我就唔知道咧，誒做完，你而家攞錢應該係做一個規劃啫，係嘛？即係未去到一啲都係detail design啦。噉我希望你哋稍後咧係能夠提供多啲資料咧，關於呢啲交通上面嗰即係方面嘅配套安排，同埋咧講清楚啲嗰啲人咧離開個會場。

94
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:13,570
幾多分鐘後係可以上到車嗱？噉你話地鐵配配合，我明白嘅。咁但係可唔可以有一啲佢哋嘅真係嘅承諾咧？咁即係你哋而家預計佢會有，到時佢冇又如何咧？噉啊，因為呢呢個都我諗我關注一路關注嘅都係成誒嗰啲觀眾能夠完咗場之後最快幾多分鐘？

95
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:33,580
後可以上到車嗱，上到車之後要幾耐唔關你事啦嚇。咁另外一個咧，我都想喺度順便提一提嘅，主席，如果你容許嘅話，就同阿阿發展局誒常務秘書長誒都講一講嘅，就係誒而家你開始做呢邊嘅工作，如果你開工起呢個體育城咧，我仍然係好關注咧，嗰度而家擺緊嘅過。

96
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,120
千個嘅車位。

97
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:55,410
啊！咁包括咗六七百架嘅呢啲所謂嘅旅遊巴嘅泊車位，咁咧香港就冇任何嘅停車場，基本上啊係去，亦都冇一個政策咧係畀佢哋泊嘅。咁當呢批車趕曬出嚟嘅話咧，誒我都幾難想像嘅路面狀況係點樣。噉我希望即係發展局度都即係關注下呢。

98
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,560
件事啫，多謝主席。

99
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,970
deputy secretary。

100
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:09,900
主席，我我會非常 happy， as soon as we have more detailed information on the dispersal and the transport arrangements， I would be very happy to share it with members of this this committee or with the council as a whole.

101
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:30,430
啊，或者方便個會議嘅記錄咧，我想問一問咧，就係頭先啊譯志明議員就問啦，即係你哋會唔會喺嗰個交通，尤其是係疏導人流嗰度咧，係喺今日呢一個申請撥款包括在內去進行研究咧？噉樣，噉啊睇問。

102
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,470
件第三段嗰度咧，或者啊？

103
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,170
啊啊，副秘書長咧，可唔可以啊幫我哋指出咧？係喺三。

104
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,720
A、B、C、D、E邊一部分係包括譯志明議員剛才問題嘅嗰個涉獵嘅範圍咧？

105
00:17:49,740 --> 00:18:09,750
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, I'd be happy to clarify that point. The actual transportation issues are being dealt with under a different consultancy, which is already underway, and so the results of that should be available before, well before we actually start the pre-construction work and the technical consultancy. And as I said, I would be very happy to share the detailed information.

106
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,680
that comes out from that work.

107
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:19,240
啊，或者啊，副秘書長咧，可以喺會後咧提供書面嘅補充資料。

108
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:36,220
下一位，鍾樹根員。誒，多謝主席。就我哋係即係支持呢個計劃嘅，因為我哋收到好多誒體育界咧，都覺得誒呢個呢啲設施係好需要。誒，佢哋覺得唔夠添，即係而家好似係一個縮水嘅。

109
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:56,510
體育體育城噉樣，噉我我覺得咧就係所因為噉樣咧，係咪誒？我哋要設計嘅時候咧，要有一個比較長遠啲嘅眼光咧，令到依個園區咧，一個體育園區咧，可以將來有擴張性、擴展性嘅，即係比比如咧，就佢跑道上邊嗰個誒都會公園啊。

110
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:16,530
誒，甚至係誒，信雲台公園嗰度咧，係咪可以一並考慮埋咧？尤其是信雲台公園，可唔可以一並考慮埋咧？做融合埋喺呢個園區裏邊咧，即係誒，令到佢哋嗰個即係環境啊，或者個設施啊，都可以咧互相使用嘅。咁誒。

111
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:36,540
都會公園咧，如果係將來嘅設計咧，係咪都係可以諗下？呢個體育城如果唔夠用嘅時候咧，都可以作為一個體育公園噉樣嘅情況去擴展，咁咧擴展佢嘅使用用途。第二點咧，我嘅意見咧就係話佢要有一定嘅彈性同埋誒，即係誒可以。

112
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:56,550
改變性嘅，譬如話園區裏邊咧，係咪有啲地方咧？如果某啲體育項目咧，可以就搭建一啲臨時嘅場館。舉個例，有一啲短池嘅比賽啊，或者跳水嘅比賽啊。咁如果其他地方唔係好適合或者唔夠用嘅時候，依度係唔可以用呢啲臨時嘅，可以做一。

113
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:16,560
啲臨時嘅誒嘅比賽嘅設施咧，當然呢啲要你個地方有先得。咁所以你在設計上咧有好多嘅運動咧，你都可以誒平時係有一個空地啊，到時咧可以臨時咧就可以搭建一啲噉嘅臨時設施。咁另外咧，佢呢度臨海咧，係咪要考慮咧？將來咧，我哋可能。

114
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:35,920
人咧擴張性喺九龍灣依度咧，就可以做一啲海上嘅運動、海上嘅活動咧，能夠係誒墜落嘅發展咧，都有有用途嘅。咁至於最後好多同事關心嗰個誒停車誒，即係交通問題咧，我覺得係咪而家我見你個道路就係誒？

115
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:56,220
係一個隧道啊！新建個道道路唔知係隧道，抑或成個公園升咗去啦嚇。咁基本上有啲誒運動場或者體育館咧，啲設施咧，佢可以做一個地牢咧，咁可以容納大大多啲嘅車輛，甚至係喺誒有大型嘅比賽嘅時候咧，就可以誒容許一啲誒公共交通。

116
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:07,720
通嘅好似巴士噉樣咧，就可以喺個地下嘅停車場裏邊咧，去盡快去接載啲成誒啲觀眾去疏散。咁可唔可以考慮呢幾點咧？多謝主席。Deputy Secretary。

117
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:28,670
Thank you, Chairman. Yeah. In terms of the usage of the venue, our assumption is that given the fact that there is already and will continue to be without this venue a shortage of public sports venues in East Kowloon, certainly we anticipate that the public sports ground and the indoor

118
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:48,680
Sports facilities, as well as the outdoor sports and recreational facilities that will be developed as part of this complex, will be extremely well used. Current usage rates for these kind of facilities in that area are 100% for sports grounds, and the 90% for the indoor facilities. So we see that there is a need, and that there will be a very high level of usage.

119
00:21:48,730 --> 00:22:08,740
There is indeed within the site as a whole, as I said just now, it's a 28 hectare site. There will be considerable areas that are open, and that will be suitable for use for temporary venues, whether for sport or recreation or even arts or cultural type events. So these kind of events would be able to.

120
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:22,050
Take place in temporary venues. They can also, of course, take place in the main venues, as the main venues will be designed in such a manner as to anticipate multi-purpose use as far as possible.

121
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,590
啊，主席啊，佢有冇考慮將宋皇台公園一齊一並考慮去重建咧？

122
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:47,880
Deputy Secretary, sorry, can I have that again, please, Chair? The Tsung Wong Toi Park would it somehow be incorporated into the project so that it can be used together? Sorry, yes, thank you very much, Chairman. Yes, the Tsung Wong Toi Park will actually be a separate PWSC item. However, it will be immediately adjacent to the.

123
00:22:47,880 --> 00:23:05,690
Sports complex. Our intention is that both the Sung Wong Tai Park and the Station Square Park, which will be another open space project in Kai Tak, would have a a seamless connection. In other words, there wouldn't be a fence or a barrier. They would lead into each other, so there would be a lot of interface between these facilities. Okay,多謝。

124
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,550
下一位胡志偉議員。

125
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,220
多謝主席，我諗你要做一個研究咧，咁大家都係即係誒。

126
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:35,930
冇乜説話可以講，你都應該要做嘅。不過我想睇依幾個重點啦。第一個就係話喺嗰個研究嘅範圍裏邊咧，你哋係會唔會將三個大球場，包括咗係體育館，即係我哋嘅紅磡體育館、香港政府大球場，同埋將來嘅呢一個即係五萬人嘅係體育。

127
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:44,410
嘅場館咧，佢哋將來嘅角色定位同埋相應嘅土地運用咧，係有一個重新嘅諗法。

128
00:23:44,830 --> 00:24:04,840
因為如果唔係嘅話，我根本想象唔到咧喺香港呢個彈丸之地咧，你係能夠即係同時容納到體育館、大球場同埋新嘅一個五萬人嘅座位嘅一個體育館。咁因此就係即係，我覺得你要向公眾講清楚就係話，做咗呢一件嘢之後，咁其他嗰兩個場館你有啲咩？

129
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:12,800
嘅諗法咧，會唔會將相應嘅土地咧，係重新規劃去適去適合呢個社會嘅新嘅需要咧？咁咧第一點。

130
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:33,280
第二個咧就牽涉到究竟政府喺推動呢一個成份文件嘅所講嘅精英體育呢個部分嘅時候咧，同一時間你用啲乜嘢嘅係能量咧去做個體體育普及嘅工作？我睇翻你哋喺康文署核下嘅資料咧，如果我剔除咗公

131
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,240
中泳池嘅入場人數嘅話，

132
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:43,790
喺康文署每一年攞三十幾億嘅行政費用洗費之下咧，全香港大概都只係有。

133
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,720
唔夠六百萬人咧，唔夠六百萬人次咧，去使用我哋嘅體育設施。

134
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:10,010
活動其實呢一個即係你哋會唔會就住呢一個嘅研究裏邊咧，都有一個環節咧，去檢視一下究竟我哋要點樣樣去全面推廣呢一種嘅係體育文化呢一種體育氛圍。一如果唔係個話，個社會有個咁大嘅場地，然後到最後你個目標都係搞呢一個嘅係即係誒誒演唱會嘅。

135
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:30,020
咁對唔住啦，咁呢個就唔係體育啦，呢個係演唱館、演唱會嘅會館嚟嘅啫。雖然我明白到一個咁大嘅球場，可能都需要其他唔同嘅活動。第三個我想問一問就係話，你哋有今天會唔會已經有一大概嘅概念，就係即係呢一個嘅係體育館，即係將來佢有啲乜嘢嘅活動咧係？

136
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:50,030
會填滿呢一個即係場館，呢啲嘅活動嘅內容，今天係咪都可以利用住香港大球場咧，去進行相應嘅活動，令到我哋嘅場地使用咧係更加有效，都向香港社會咧係講清楚就話，我哋諗嘅嘢唔係今日上嚟寫文寫文件嘅時候咧就諗。

137
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:58,850
住，呃呃，下大家到最後咧，其實都係唔會做嘅。咁呢個我諗係要去交代翻。我諗就呢三個問題，多謝主席。

138
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:19,240
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, these are actually very, very good points. In relation to the first point, with the Hong Kong Colosseum, we do not really anticipate that the future sports complex will have a venue that is comparable to that. The Colosseum currently provides a capacity of ten to twelve thousand seats in an indoor environment for.

139
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:39,250
sports and largely also for entertainment events, and we do not really see anything within the sports complex that will take the place of that. However, the question about the current Hong Kong Stadium is very pertinent indeed. We have previously, in earlier consultancy studies on the financing of the new complex, looked at the issue of the Hong Kong Stadium, and the Secretary.

140
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,940
Home Affairs previously at the HA panel at the Home Affairs panel has stated that.

141
00:26:44,240 --> 00:27:04,250
It would be unlikely that the Hong Kong Stadium would be able to retain its current scale once the new project is built, particularly as the sports complex will have a 50,000-plus seat new stadium with a retractable roof. We do, however, feel that from a sporting perspective, there is a reason and a logic for maintaining the current site of the Hong Kong Stadium.

142
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:24,260
作為一個體育場，儘管是一個場地，會更多用於社區體育、學校和地方體育協會，而不是作為一個大型活動場地。如果我可以非常快速地回答這兩個點，主席。在促進社區運動方面，而不是隻專注於精英運動，我們認為這個場地將扮演。

143
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:44,270
A major part in helping to boost community sports promotion, particularly in the East Kowloon area, where there is a shortage of venues, particularly sports grounds and indoor sports venues, when compared to the planning standards and guidelines that the area should have. I do recognise that with fewer than six million people recorded as using LCSD facilities.

144
00:27:44,270 --> 00:28:04,280
This seems like a low number, but in fact the usage rates of the facilities run by LCSD are very, very high. As I said earlier, for sports grounds and football pitches, they are around 100% in terms of the available usage rate. For indoor sports centres, they're very commonly above 90%. So in fact, there's a large amount of use. I think the issue is more with a shortage of facility.

145
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:24,290
rather than necessary a shortage of participation per se. And just finally, in terms of the event profile for the sports complex, again it's early days. We're probably six years away from seeing the complex open, and of course at this stage we could not really design a complete event profile as such. However, in the early planning stages, we've already

146
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:44,300
我們已經看了未來的財政和管理的問題。在這個階段，我們的顧問已經確認了41種不同的類型的活動，可以在三個主要的場地舉行。特別是在主場地，有活動，例如娛樂、音樂會和文化活動，例如表演。

147
00:28:44,300 --> 00:29:04,310
展覽、展

148
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:11,010
會be able to provide scope for a lot more different types of event than the current stadium at Soekandpu. Thank you, Chairman.

149
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,630
下一位係陳志全議員。

150
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,760
係多謝主席。

151
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:26,130
啊！支持香港增加體育設施或者興建呢個大型嘅體育場館咧，就唔代表係一定支持啟德體育園區嘅。

152
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:44,620
就算唔反對啟德體育園區嘅研究咧，都唔代表咧對呢份文件咧係毫無疑問。啊，頭先有議員咧就話支持個大方向，但係就即係對份文件毫無疑問咁啦。其實今次呢份文件咧係非常之單薄啊，主席。

153
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:59,830
佢雖然表面上係攞呢個六千萬多啲噉樣嚇，但係佢交代畀我哋嘅資料咧係好少，即係可以唔講嘅都唔講，即係唔擺入去呢個文件嗰度，我覺得係。

154
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:08,040
民政事務委員會咧，當日唔反對嚇話提交嚟公務小組，其實都提出咗好多問題。

155
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,760
而喺呢份文件裏邊，我睇唔到咧有補充嘅資料，係多過上一次。

156
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:25,420
我哋提出，你睇翻今日個簡介，大家都見到啊！採購融資安排模式提出關注，嚇擔心超支。

157
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:37,600
擔心員工時間最新造價呢份文件咧都似備咗冇掂㗎，就算成個園區嘅面積都係頭先啊梁國雄問噉啊。

158
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,480
誒，助理秘書長就。

159
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,650
副秘書長就話係，即係即係係二十八公頃。

160
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:58,060
咁嗰個總嘅開支係點咧？呢個文件總工程費用係點咧？呢個文件我又見唔到，我哋會擔心超支嘅問題。

161
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:18,350
好似西九噉，大家最清楚個大方向。當初都冇乜人會敢反對西九，但係開咗個頭之後咧，一路洗濕咗個頭咧，而家都唔知幾多錢先賣到單，都唔好講成本效益啊！即係賣到單，大家畀得出，覺得市民會有好大反響，都已經已經係啦，但。

162
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:30,200
係噉，而家呢一個會唔會？你而家都未睇到，即係唔主動去交代，唔主動同我哋討論，我哋真係點知道？即係雖然畀咗嚿，畀咗個開頭錢你，件事就繼續做落去㗎啦。

163
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,980
而未未掌握呢啲資料，你又唔主動去回應喺民政事務委員會嘅問題。

164
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,490
可唔可以先回應翻？回應咗呢樣嘢先咧。

165
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,120
副秘書長。

166
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,340
多謝主席。

167
00:31:47,350 --> 00:32:07,360
In terms of the budget for the future construction of the sports complex, clearly this is something that will come out of the consultants and the technical work and the pre-construction work that we are currently seeking funding for through this item. We have, however, previously.

168
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,390
在內政委員會會議上，提到一個指示性的。

169
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:21,470
預算， for the entire project， based on the original 2010 technical feasibility study scope， of approximately 25 billion dollars.

170
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,450
And I believe that figure has also been mentioned in the media.

171
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:45,740
However, that is purely a preliminary figure that we have given for the purposes of making an initial illustration to give people an idea of the scale and scope of this project. Clearly, we need to do the pre-construction work, in particular the detailed quantity surveying and technical work, and also look at the future.

172
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,560
Operating parameters of this complex before we will be able to come up with a full and final estimate for this project.

173
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,850
when。

174
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,340
We come back to this subcommittee sometime in the next 18 months to two years to ask for the full funding.

175
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:20,730
for the MPSC project at Kai Tak, then we will have a much firmer budgetary figure based on the work that we've done through the pre-construction work and this consultancy. And, Chairman, I assure members that we are just as concerned about the budget for this project. We do not want to see it go over budget. We do not want to see the construction budget for this.

176
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,140
project affect the way in which it is operated in the future, which is key to the success of the project.

177
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,500
主席，而家唔係超支啊，係唔支啊！

178
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,360
唔知就點超支啊！

179
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:53,860
第一，我就係唔明白點解你講緊有嗰個二零一零年二百五十億都唔擺落今日嘅文件，同埋唔去盡量你哋諗得五年啦，去若摸估計。當你連大數若摸估計都估計唔到，就叫我哋洗頭，即係入去間髮型屋剪頭髮洗咗頭先啦。啊，噉係咪道理咧？主席，你覺得？

180
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,690
下一位，陳家樂員。

181
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,840
唔該，主席。

182
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:07,950
如果睇翻呢一個嘅文件咧，而家係講緊申請六千萬多少少去做一個嘅呢個啟德體育園區嘅前期嘅工程。

183
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:28,240
啊嘅一啲嘅計劃部分噉，包括一啲技術顧問嘅服務啦。噉啊，睇下啲主要即係工程嘅技術規格啊、概念設計啊、啲即係地下嘅水管嘅鋪設啊、做樹木嘅測量啊、地形嘅測量啊、土地嘅勘測啊咁一樣。咁所以即係除非我哋喺呢一刻就話我哋不能夠接受喺啟德呢個地方。

184
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:48,250
咧去發展嗰個即係體育嘅誒誒政策嘅硬件嘅配套，咁否則的話咧，我就睇唔到咩特別嘅理由咧。就住呢六千幾萬嘅前期工程嘅申請咧，我哋就係要誒否決佢，或者唔接受呢一個做法。咁但係當然即係我諗每一位嘅議員，包括我哋。

185
00:34:48,250 --> 00:35:08,260
或者我本人係跟體育政策都好關心，亦好擔心嘅咧。就好多時，我哋誒即係個個個心就係好好嘅，就想為香港嘅即係體育嘅政策咧係誒進一步去即係推動。噉啊，但係一做出嚟嘅結果咧，我哋就好擔心咧啲嘢就會走樣嘅，因為唔係未試過咧香港呢個地方，唔知咩嚟。

186
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:28,270
理由咧，譬如大球場，即係已經係誒唔好介意。即係而家我哋要過，要再再嚟過㗎啦。因為開始嘅時候，連嗰個擺位嘅方向啊、太陽日照啊嗰啲都搞唔清楚嘅。咁整咗出嚟嘅時候咧，又話唔夠太陽，射啲草，啲草又生得唔好。咁樹搞來搞去，搞來搞去，一直要再嚟過啦。咁噉我哋啲經驗係慘痛嘅，我哋唔想再有呢啲經驗喺香港。

187
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:48,280
發生其實真係醜聞嚟嘅，係咪？然後你又賴天氣，你又賴太陽，你又賴月亮，噉啊真係嘥鬼氣。咁所以如果你話要攞錢做呢一個嘅前期工程咧，我哋真係要督促即係局方去同呢啲嘅即係嚇誒合約嘅承辦嘅嘅嘅朋友咧講清講楚呢啲慘痛嘅經驗，同埋。

188
00:35:48,280 --> 00:36:03,850
唔好即係諗住即係簡單做幾個電腦模擬啊！噉啊交功課算數。我哋真係要喺呢啲經驗當中學習，而唔好講到好似大球場嗰陣時咁相對長遠，但係其實都繼續纏繞緊我哋。我哋就係講最近啲單車場。

189
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:24,140
都發現問題嘅係咪？即係好地地，我哋又畀曬錢啦。嗱，照計都有做勘測㗎，照計都有土地平整㗎，照計都有做呢啲㗎。咁除完之後，發覺喂，好似仲係仲要執漏嘅，誒執好多漏添。噉你整完之後發覺之後，啲人係覺得唔係好用得嘅。真真正正嘅精英運動員就係你唔好搞我，我都覺得你唔合規格嘅。噉啊慘啦！即係我哋。

190
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:44,150
就就好似唔知點咧，係咪終於由頭債債有主係應該係賴邊個好咧？話問責嘅時候係問呢啲誒攞咗我哋政府錢去做呢啲嘅工程或者做呢啲嘅研究嘅人啦，還是真係要問下在座嘅官員，其實你哋到底有冇噉嘅技能，有冇噉嘅知識，有冇噉嘅誒誒誒訓練去到教？

191
00:36:44,150 --> 00:37:04,160
監督監察，即係呢啲嘅工程咧，最後係做咗攞咗錢，做完出嚟，然後發覺成件事係走咗樣，或者要更加多嘅資源同埋時間咧，去到執漏執翻正佢。因為呢啲其實咧係好重要嘅，即係精英運動員嘅設施。我哋唔想將佢淪為咧，就淨係搞大型活動。

192
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:24,170
係咪啊？軍操啊，演唱會啊，係咪即係萬人空汗嗰啲？即係我唔係淨係想嗰啲咯，嗰啲就容易啦，唔使搞咁多嘢添啦。但係我哋真係要合國際規格，係好正嘅體育設施。咁呢方面咧，過往經驗咧，誒暫時畀唔到好十足十嘅信心，我哋做。

193
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:44,180
噉我又想好具體咁問，喺呢一個你攞六千幾萬做嘅前期工程方面，點樣樣將呢啲過往嘅，我認為係係唔好嘅經驗，甚至乎近乎醜聞嘅經驗，都可以透過呢一次，你可以話到畀我知，點樣喺政府內部依啲同呢啲嘅誒承判商去傾嘅時候咧，都將呢啲過往經驗咧，都。

194
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:59,400
納入去考慮，而到最後出咗嚟，你跟住下一步咧，就係真係嗰啲場館啊嘛，係咪？你話B部嗰啲啊嘛，下邊嗰嗰幾項嘅場館設計方面咧，係話到畀我哋知道，係畀到我哋信心，我哋唔係為做而做咧，主席。

195
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:19,710
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, I think these are very fair points, and these are certainly something that we're very appraised of. Large sporting infrastructure, whether it's in Hong Kong or elsewhere in the world, does have a record of things going wrong. We're aware, for example, of Wembley Stadium having to resurface their pitch thirteen times after it was first opened.

196
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:39,720
Recently opened Singapore Sports Hub has had well documented issues and teething troubles with opening. We are aware not only of problems that have happened with major sports venues in Hong Kong, but also overseas. And clearly, we need to learn from that experience, particularly when looking at the key aspects of the major venues. In terms of the ability of the government team.

197
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,390
and our consultants to oversee the work. I think we have.

198
00:38:44,670 --> 00:39:04,680
developed a fairly large reservoir of expertise within the government itself in terms of the management of the architectural and also the the leisure management. However, we do recognise that that needs to be augmented, and we have already tendered for an expert operations consultant who will come in and who will supervise the entire process of the

199
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:21,250
technical and overseeing and management work throughout the design and detail design and construction and early operation period of this complex to ensure that we also have the best international expertise and experience to advise us on making sure that we have effective monitoring of this project.

200
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,380
陳源，誒，我問下一輪啊，主席，因為時間唔夠。屯北臣議員。

201
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,200
Mr. McLeary.

202
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,330
If this complex,

203
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,340
After completion, can take.

204
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,050
sports。

205
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,050
到一個完全不同的level in Hong Kong，我會有 no hesitatio

206
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,250
In coming out and suggest we build a second one.

207
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:54,820
所以，我嘅主要 concern 是：，我哋喺香港做咗啲乜嘢關於體育嘅嘢？

208
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
With all the

209
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,840
呃。

210
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,610
誒，pledge made by government.

211
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:11,510
first of all, I was once involved in that in that area. I was appointed by government on I forgot the name.

212
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:17,920
It was a committee that I resigned the quickest.

213
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,710
因為它係咁政治。

214
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,050
It's incredible. It wasn't even about sports.

215
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,510
Okay， it was about different interest groups fighting for different things。

216
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,260
所以， anyway。

217
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,730
my question is， we build the colosseum。

218
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,150
supposedly，the Chinese name is體育館。

219
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:51,060
I think in the last four years, it had only held 12 related events, events related to sports, and over 100 or 200.

220
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,760
with entertainment， so that actually is not太好ood。

221
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,880
亦都係外食羣，或。

222
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,940
entertainment， right？

223
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:10,720
How many nights on the average in the last few years were the what's the Hong Kong stadium used for sports?

224
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,660
你有啲咩figure？

225
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:34,460
Chairman, I don't have the figure specifically for sports events. Roughly, half the time, a quarter of the time, there are 365 days, nights, okay, a year. For the Hong Kong Stadium itself, there are roughly 30 event days per year. Approximately 80% of those, I think, are

226
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:41,160
Sports related, I would have to come back. Thirty times eighty, that's twenty-four. So now I'm a bit confused.

227
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,980
你有個香港 Stadium 現在坐三十、 forty thousand。

228
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,900
Okay， it was only able to attract these major events for 24 nights out of a year.

229
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,240
The colosseum attracted.

230
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,940
10 events per year, so between these two, they attracted.

231
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,170
三十多場的event in a year。

232
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:10,280
Now we are building this 50,000-seat retractable roof stadium.

233
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,960
I can't see how.

234
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,810
你可以close個gap。

235
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,830
我 just curious， how many nights.

236
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,790
Do you plan to be able to use this for sports?

237
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,740
since this is what you intend to do in the first place.

238
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,480
deputy secretary.

239
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:50,600
Chairman, I mean, it's a very, very good question, and the utilisation rate of the Hong Kong—I—we can't help it. I wasn't going to ask, but no, this calculation. I just, yeah, please. I'm happy to try and provide some clarification, and Miss Law can provide some more detailed figures in a second. Yes, I mean, the the utilisation rate of the Hong Kong Stadium, I think, is somewhat disappointing.

240
00:42:50,600 --> 00:43:10,610
And it is certainly below what was anticipated when the the venue was rebuilt in exactly. Okay. So why would this be better? Well, I think the very simple answer to that, Chairman, is that the current stadium has severe limitations in terms of its ability to host a wide variety of different. Great, fantastic. Now I see the.

241
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,420
第二個問題：，how many applications have you received for the Hong Kong Stadium?

242
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:30,780
In terms of the usage of the the stadium, right for sports, none because people were not happy with the other facilities, right? So you you have reason to believe that if Hong Kong Stadium today facilities are upgraded.

243
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:51,090
then you could fill that stadium with what 60,70,80% a year, really? Is there any documentation that we can see at Lashko to show that a lot of major sports events organisers are interested to come to Hong Kong Stadium, and the only reason they're not coming is?

244
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,770
Because of facilities, is there any evidence of that? That's my worry.

245
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:10,980
Chairman, it's a good question. I don't really have any hard evidence and figures on hand, but I'd be happy to look through and provide some. Because otherwise, this is just a blind guess. Another 50,000-seater retractable roof. It sounds expensive.

246
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:28,940
Right, it's like a convertible Porsche, right? And what what is the guarantee that it will be used? Is there anything at all that you have to show us to back up your plan, or do you have any plan at all? I mean, let let let's talk about plan. Do you have any plan at all?

247
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:34,300
Once completed, 50% of time, 20% of time, they will be used.

248
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:54,980
Sports, deputy secretary. Certainly, chairman, if I may sort of just dial this back a little bit. The primarily, the primary purpose of the sports complex, which includes obviously the stadium and other facilities, is clearly to be a sports complex. However, we have to recognise that there is also scope for other events, which currently do not take place in Hong Kong.

249
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:14,990
to be able to take place particularly at the main stadium, given that it will not suffer from the same limitations that the current Hong Kong stadium does. For example, and this is just one example, the famous pop musician Lady Gaga, she played in. So in other words, what you planned for the 50,000 seater stadium is actually really not.

250
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,940
for sports.

251
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:27,280
You actually have more confidence utilising it. Honourable team, I think it is fairer for you to allow the deputy secretary to complete his answer. Deputy secretary, please.

252
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:47,570
I was just giving the example of Lady Gaga, Chairman, which when she played, I was reckoning, yes, when she played her concert in in Seoul in Korea, she played a concert in a fifty zero seat stadium. When she came to Hong Kong, she had to play four concerts in the Asia World Arena because there was no venue in which she could put on a stadium concert in Hong Kong. This is simply an example of the.

253
00:45:47,570 --> 00:46:07,580
這種類型的事件，和很多其他類型的事件，我們認為現在正在其他城市、在亞洲、在太平洋、在世界，會能夠使用一個新的大型設施，類型的設施，我們正在規劃為台北，但現在還不能夠使用香港體育館。我們當然不知道有多少人會來。

254
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:21,920
If we had already developed that venue, however, it's almost certain to say that Lady Gaga's entourage did not try and book the Hong Kong Stadium simply because there would have been no point in it. But certainly, government doesn't consider Lady Gaga as being the sports business, right?

255
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:42,370
主席，正如我早前所説，本項目的主要目的在於提供體育賽事，而我們認為絕大多數的賽事將會是體育賽事，舉行於不僅僅是主場館，而是整個複合體的其他場館。然而，我們必須承認，有其他類型的活動，香港市民會欣賞，也有可能在該複合體舉行。

256
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,710
Mr. Mr. Chairman, I have to. I have to. Sorry, yeah.

257
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:50,770
我 just have to make myself clear， the title of this complex is sports。

258
00:46:51,050 --> 00:47:11,060
所以，如果the stadium is used mostly for sports，我唔 mind if they throw Lady Gaga concerts，你 know， throughout the year。但係如果concerts took up eighty percent and sports only twenty， and government cannot give us any indication as to how many sporting events they they they have confidence to。

259
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:21,920
Track, then why don't we change the name of this? Anyway, that's only my comment. All right. On routine, I suppose you would have to wait until your second round to continue with this dialogue.

260
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,900
陳健林議員。

261
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,430
誒，多謝主席。

262
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,220
即係我哋係支持喺啟德誒興建呢個體育園嘅。

263
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,130
喺過去。

264
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,740
都有相當長嘅時間咧。

265
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:43,550
當國際之間咧舉辦一啲大型嘅體育比賽嘅時候，香港嘅

266
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:47,500
運動員每當一次攞到。

267
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,770
一啲獎項嘅時候咧，香港市民都會感覺到非常之歡欣鼓舞。

268
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,730
但另一方面咧，亦都會批評政府咧。

269
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,640
就係對體育運動係冇支持。

270
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:11,830
其中一個咧，最重要嘅就係我哋嘅體育嗰個政策，同埋我哋嘅體育設施咧係不足。

271
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,390
噉啊！

272
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,510
喺香港興建大型嘅。

273
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,180
運動場或者係球場。

274
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,870
誒，我相信都係長期以嚟，香港市民咧。

275
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,890
嗰個要求嚟嘅。

276
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,170
過去每一年咧，我哋都會。

277
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:40,260
誒舉辦一啲國際嘅比賽啦嚇，誒特別係足球賽，啲咩香港市民都好中意足球啊，咁所以咧就喺香港嘅大球場。

278
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,660
咁但係大家都知道咧，就係香港大球場咧。

279
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:57,560
連嗰個草地咧都有時管理不善，嚇噉啊，造成好多國際嘅笑話。咁當然呢個就係因為我哋過去一直以嚟係對呢一個體育嘅政策咧係比較疏忽。

280
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,880
咁如果我哋香港有大型嘅呢個國際嚇？

281
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:17,980
足以嚇舉辦呢個國際大型嘅運動嘅活動嘅場所嘅話咧，我相信我哋會投放更多嘅資源，啊，亦都會引入更多嘅人才咧，係做好呢個管理嘅工作，特別係。

282
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:35,140
喺體德嘅體育場裏邊咧，我哋會有大型嘅，亦都有小型嘅訓練場。咁對於未來嗰個體育嘅人才嘅培訓咧，應該係有更好嘅、更利有利嘅呢個條件。所以，我認為咧。

283
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:45,030
誒呢個問題喺民政事務嗰個委員會裏邊咧，亦都經過長時間嘅討論，大家基本上都係支持嘅。

284
00:49:45,310 --> 00:50:05,320
咁所以，我認為咧，事到今日，我哋唔應該再用種種嘅理由咧嚟到阻撓呢一份文件嘅通過。特別係當我哋去討論到嗰個運動場嘅使用嘅時候咧，大家都知道，除咗係利用作為體育運動。

285
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:13,140
之用之外咧，其實佢個用途仲係可以有好多其他嘅，即係開即係開拓嘅。

286
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:28,630
誒，我哋記得咧，就係而家國際上咧，每一年搞奧運嘅國家咧，佢哋都會充分使用自己嘅巨大嘅體育館咧，係除咗體育之外做其他嘅活動之用。咁其實呢個亦都係。

287
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:37,640
正確去使用現有嘅資源嘅一種做法，噉我覺得呢個係值得我哋支持。如果我哋冇一個咁大嘅體育館咧，

288
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:47,790
噉我哋要舉辦盛大嘅呢個活動嘅時候，亦都係冇場所。如果想做一啲國際性嘅體育活動咧，亦都冇地方去。

289
00:50:48,660 --> 00:51:08,670
咁所以咧，我覺得咧，就我哋係應該要支持呢一個體育館，特別咧喺過去嘅一段時間，當我哋講啟德嘅規劃嘅時候，政府亦都作咗呢個承諾，喺香港嘅體育界裏邊咧，亦都有強烈嘅要求，希望政府係盡快去落實呢個計劃嘅。咁所以今日呢個。

290
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:18,360
個噉樣嘅文件嚟到，亦都已經排隊咧，係誒經過好長嘅時間先至輪到佢。咁所以我哋係會全力咧係支持呢一份文件嘅，多謝主席。

291
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,560
陳宇仁，你唔需要當局回答啦。

292
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,860
下一位，第二輪嘅護資委員。

293
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:45,150
多謝主席。我諗大家都冇意思咧，係去阻撓呢一個研究咧，係上馬。即係我諗要搞清楚件事。不過，即係喺做體育一個體育園區嘅時候，我一定有個好大嘅責任，就要問我哋點樣搞好我哋香港嘅體育政策，而希望都嚟緊。我哋如果最後要落實呢一個係體育體育。

294
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:49,100
園區嘅話咧，要動用嘅公帑咧，超過二百億嘅。

295
00:51:49,410 --> 00:52:09,420
一個咁大嘅數目嘅公堂嘅動用，如果我只係話畀人聽就係我哋諗住咧，就有個大型嘅場地噉，然後可以辦到國際活動嘅話咧，我得呢一個咧唔係公眾希望我哋所做嘅工作。我哋希望有嗰個體育園區，佢有噉嘅設備嘅時間咧，係能夠帶動成個社會嘅體育氣氛。呢一個先係最大嘅一個目標。

296
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:18,800
頭先秘書長又講到就係話咧，喺誒，即係佢都承認啦，喺而家康文署核下嘅場地個使用情況咧。

297
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:28,470
係佢覺得最大嘅問題咧，係一個設施嘅短缺，就唔係咧係公眾投入嘅程度。

298
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:48,760
咁第一個，我就當然希望就係話，既然你噉樣講嘅話，你可話畀我聽，你喺上財務委員會之前，或者係即係喺呢個研究度過程裏邊咧，政府係會承諾係全面做。我哋如何能夠補充足夠嘅係需要嘅體育設施，去滿足社會？

299
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,890
可以係做好我哋嘅體適能訓練嘅工作，呢個大策略嚟㗎嘛？

300
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:04,240
你既然嚟緊要攞兩百幾億嘅錢嘅時候，即係你點可能唔話畀我聽個大策略點樣樣？第二，我想同你指出就係話咧。

301
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:11,920
有研究講，香港小朋友個體適能咧係差嘅，係差住成個東南亞區嘅。

302
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:28,440
我想問個問題就係：當我哋搞咁大體育城嘅時候，體育園區嘅時候，如果我哋嘅後生嘅一輩嘅體識能係咁差嘅話，咁即係點啊？係咪即係好似秘書長所講，就話將來呢個球場就攞嚟做呢一個Lady Gaga嘅演唱會咧？

303
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:48,870
香港體育館咧已經一個最明顯嘅問題，叫體育館有八成嘅節目咧都係由呢個演唱會填滿嘅。十年後仲有冇呢啲家格可以有本事吸引到四萬五萬人嚟睇呢啲節目咧？對唔住啊，大家真係諗一諗清楚先。而家嘅網上世界噉樣樣嘅話，將來係咩世界，我同你都唔知。

304
00:53:48,870 --> 00:54:03,020
但係，我覺得既然你冠其名係叫體育館嘅話，你冇可能話畀我聽，我哋係冇一個有效推動整體嘅係我哋普及體育，令到我哋成個社會嘅體育氛圍咧係改善嘅情景。

305
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:20,680
所以我都想問就係話，你有咩策略喺呢個工作上面做好香港嘅即係市民啦，特別係小朋友、年青一代嘅體適能嘅改善。可能你話唔關你事都好，但係我覺得你有責任咧去統籌呢一個工作，因為你嚟緊要攞兩百幾億嘅體育園區嘅撥款。

306
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,120
deputy secretary.

307
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:43,910
Chairman, this is a very good question, but it's also a very very big question in terms of the overall sports policy. I would like to make a couple of points, though, particularly in relation to this project and how they relate to sports policy. First, as we've said in the paper and as I've said a couple of times already here this morning, this is first and foremost a sports project.

308
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:54,010
我唔想掛住Lady Gaga。我們已經講過她夠多。呢個只是另一種事件可以帶入的例子。但首先和最重要，呢個會係一個運動項目。

309
00:54:54,290 --> 00:55:14,300
The second very important point is that the main stadium is only a part of this project. In fact, the major usage of the future multi-sports complex at Kai Tak will be public usage—the public sports ground, which will meet a need, particularly in East Kowloon, for an additional public sports ground facility. The

310
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:34,310
內地體育中心，會有兩個大型俱樂部，以及其他內地體育中心。再次，會幫助東區公共體育設施的需要。東區有廣泛的户外體育設施和開放空間的公園，再次滿足社區的需要。我接受你説的關於香港兒童的問題。

311
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:54,320
as in many other places, having having a problem with getting enough exercise, and having the right physical condition, we will continue to spend the bulk of our budget allocated for sports development on the promotion of sport in the community, as we already do. Far by the greater part of our budget goes on promoting sport in the community through the organisation of sports programmes.

312
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:14,330
Through the management and development of venues, we do have an issue, as you've quite rightly pointed out, with the sufficiency of venues for promoting sport. There comes a point where you can promote sport as much as you like. If you don't have anywhere to play, it's not going to work. So we are very conscious of the need to extend the the scope of the public sports venues, and I can guarantee that.

313
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:22,060
for the greater part of this complex in East Kowloon, these will be public sports facilities open for daily use by the public.

314
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:42,570
主席，唔好意思，我我其實我我明白就係話，當然唔係秘書長自己一個可以答到呢一個問題啦。關於我哋個體育政策嘅，但係因為嚟緊係要攞成兩百幾億嘅一個撥款啦，我相信咧做完研究之後一個好大嘅project，我亦都好相信就係到其時全社會都會再問一個問題，就係話究竟我哋體育政策係點樣樣，我點樣能夠推動。

315
00:56:42,570 --> 00:57:02,580
普及體育，我我想唔知有冇即係，譬如民政事務局嘅係即係常備可以係承諾，你哋係會聯同呢一個係教育局係有一個總整合嘅文件咧，係講清楚究竟我哋未來嘅體育政策推動呢個體適能嘅係工作係點？

316
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:14,320
點樣樣做？即係呢啲，如果係政府自己就話，我而家做體育城，所以我就淨係做呢一嚿嘢，做好設施啦。咁其他政策就唔關我事個。噉我諗呢一個其實唔係一個合理嘅交代嘅，多主席。

317
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:35,040
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, it's not a question of this not being part of our policy objective. The promotion of sport and the promotion of sport in schools and the promotion of sport among young people is very much part of our policy objective. And clearly, I recognise the need when we come back to this committee for the full funding for this project, be it 25 billion or whatever it turns.

318
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:52,620
或者會議員你都可以適切地喺民政事務委員會度適時跟進嘅。

319
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,130
陳家樂演。

320
00:57:54,490 --> 00:58:14,500
各位主席，誒跟進翻我上一輪，即係關於我哋以往喺香港嚇發生過嘅啲體育場館技術上工程上面出現嘅種種嘅，我認為係好差嘅情況啊。分別就係大球場同埋最新落成嗰個將軍嗰個單車館咧。

321
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:34,510
即係大家睇新聞都知道，用咗七個月就要去維修啦，因為嗰個即係木板嗰個即係單車賽道發現有輕微所謂輕微，我唔知咩叫輕微啦嘅一個即係扭曲咗嘅情況，噉啊又要再維修啦。噉我就誒頭先誒聽副秘書長個回覆咧，我我多謝你承認呢啲。

322
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:54,520
嘅問題係以往發生過啊，噉係都你都誒承諾咧，我哋係呢一邊咧就係你會去好認真、好小心去檢視過往發生過嘅啊種種嘅問題咧，喺嚟緊呢一個嘅前期工程啊嘅勘探啊研究嘅時候咧，都誒好細緻咁考慮同埋確保咧有。

323
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:10,880
足夠嘅人才咧，同埋人手咧，去到去做好呢一個體育體得體育體育園區嗰個嘅成個規劃嘅概念。咁但係咧，我覺得誒咁未必夠嘅，即係口頭上。我都希望咧喺嚟緊，你再上財委會之前咧，就住過往呢啲嘅事件。

324
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:31,170
政府都應該有一個反思啊，係咪？Learning from past mistakes，噉你都要諗下，即係過發生過嘅一啲嘅事件，對於你呢一個咁大規模嘅啟德體育園區嘅規劃發展嘅時候咧，係有啲乜嘢你認為可以再做得好啲，或者係加緊去做去改善係嘛？咁呢個其實即係一個問責嘅過程嚟嘅噉。

325
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:51,200
誒，我希望你能夠誒同意我噉樣做。第二樣嘢咧，主席係關於同工程有關嘅。其實而家係做緊一個嘅環評，誒環境影響評估嘅，就住即係嗰個體育園區嗰個範圍。噉我睇文件嘅啫，其實就係話到到今年年底咧，你呢一個報告咧就會做完㗎啦。噉，噉我即係一個具體嘅問題啫。嗱，你而家又去揾？

326
00:59:51,200 --> 01:00:11,210
去揾一個公司幫你做呢個即係前期工程嘅研究啦。噉你覺得你認為呢？嚇呢一個嘅誒環境嘅影響評估，需唔需要再做多次咧？喺做完呢一個嘅即係前期勘勘探之後，可能有好多要再改動，可能有好多牽涉到個環境，係嘛？你要可能要再做多次。

327
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:31,220
咁呢方面有冇即係考慮在內，還是你覺得而家做緊嘅喺即係從概念出發嘅，去到二零一五年交嘅報告嗰個嘅環境影響評估已經足以畀到啊足夠嘅認受性，你去唔需要再做多一次環評咧？主席，Secretary，sorry，long moment，Chairman，thank you。In just a moment，I'll ask my colleagues。

328
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:40,300
從建築服務部門來處理技術問題和環境影響評估，因為他們正在監督這項工作。就關於

329
01:00:40,730 --> 01:01:00,740
Misfortunes that have befallen various new sports facilities, be it in Hong Kong or anywhere else in the world, I'd be very happy to provide a couple of examples of areas where I think we need to be very aware that we don't make the same mistakes that have been made in other areas. I mentioned the case of Wembley, which is a documented.

330
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:20,750
In fact, the Singapore Sports Hub obviously has had teething problems. There have been problems in stadiums in Australia where they didn't have a big enough pipe for the beer to come through during major games. These are all things that we need to think about. There are a myriad of examples. I'm sure every major sports facility has had its teething problems. What I'm prepared to do, Chairman, would be very

331
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:39,290
happy to do is maybe provide a few examples where we have specifically taken note of in terms of referring to our future planning for this complex, in particular with regard to things like the surface, the height, the the disposition of the site. I'd be very happy to provide a few examples, but this cannot be exhaustive. Thank you. Thank you.

332
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:58,480
E.I.誒係咪請阿黃立輝先生？黃先生誒，多謝主席。誒，體育園區嗰個主場館嘅工程咧，就係屬於環境影響評估條例個指定項目嘅。咁呢樣我哋明白嘅。咁所以我哋而家咧就誒已經係委聘咗誒。

333
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:19,070
誒顧問咧就就呢個環境影響咧係做緊一個評估一個研究嘅，噉我哋預料希望喺今年之內可以完成個報告，就提交誒環保處去審核啦。咁誒裏邊所提出嘅嘅緩解措施啊，誒對呢個工程啊對附近影響，例如噪音啊、景觀啊、誒廢物處理各方面咧。

334
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:36,760
都會係喺嗰個誒報告裏邊交代。咁如果經環保處係審核誒誒即係同意之後咧，呢啲噉嘅緩解措施，亦都會係寫入咗將來誒局方所批出合約。噉我哋確保係可以唔止係一個報告，而係可以係落實執行。唔該。

335
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:57,050
主席就跟進一點咧，就係因為而家係做緊嗰個嘅，即係我哋而家批緊六千幾萬咧，其實都牽涉到都幾具體嘅，即係嗰個將來嗰個園區個規劃啊，裏邊嗰啲場館點樣擺啊，或者下邊啲渠點樣鋪啊。咁其實呢啲可能同嗰個即係始終咧，到最後落成嘅時候咧，同個周邊嘅環。

336
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:17,060
環境當中咧都會有一定程度嘅互動啦，一定有影響啦。啊，你唔好講噪音啊、交通啊、空氣都有嘅，或者水質都有嘅。咁可能即係喺呢度有言在先提一提咧，即係你而家做嗰個嘅環評，到底係基於啲乜嘢嚟到做嘅咧？咁即係當我哋一啲好具體嗰個即係嗰個建建構物啊，呢啲設施都仲喺度。

337
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:37,210
揾樣緊嚇，做緊呢個前期嘅揾樣嘅時候咧，咁將來會唔會再有需要做咧？咁呢個條例還條例，我即係講從一個啊，即係社區嘅角度去出發去諗下呢一個問題。咁當然我會即係引鏡二代啦，睇下你年底出嚟嗰個環評報告，你即係有啲乜嘢嘅所謂啊parameters啊，睇下有啲咩所謂嘅標的喺。

338
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:49,000
下邊噉啊，再睇睇將來，即係呢一個嘅誒顧問嘅研究出埋嚟之後咧，可以再做個對比啦，係嘛？然後再揾翻嚟再傾，唔該。陳志全議員，多謝主席。

339
01:03:49,320 --> 01:04:09,330
首先，我都係想跟進翻嗰個誒造價嘅問題啦。咁頭先政府答就係話，二零一零年係二百五十億，而家個誒最後造價係未曾有數字。但係我想問下，有冇一個粗略嘅估算咧？可唔可以今日答到？譬如唔會。

340
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,500
超過三百億。

341
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:30,790
或者唔會超過四百億嚇，你都要畀一個約數畀我哋。你去雖然係攞呢六千幾萬嘅前期研究，但係你個大數如果係完全係兩回事嘅，啊，到時可能五百億嘅啫，噉就已經係另一個古仔嚟㗎啦嚇。咁今日。

342
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:38,760
可唔可以大約？你心裏，我唔係要你準確嘅，你即係心裏邊有冇一條數喺度咧？或者唔會超支嘅，或者就算超都係五十。

343
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,060
幾多個percent左右嘅啫，噉樣。

344
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,380
deputy secretary。

345
01:04:44,670 --> 01:05:04,680
Chairman, at this stage, when we have not even begun the pre-construction work, including the quantity surveying work, the site mapping, the utility mapping, the tree survey, the operations consultancy, it is simply not possible for me to commit to what I think the ultimate.

346
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:19,370
figure might be, it would simply be irresponsible and it would be guesswork on my part. We have previously simply said that our estimate, based on the 2010 technical feasibility statement, is in the order of 25 billion dollars, and I can go no further than that today.

347
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,100
國家奇遇。

348
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:34,230
主席，主席，我唔好意思，我繼續問緊嘅。陳傳源，唔好意思。啊，咁即係話嗰二百五十億都係靠股啦，即係今日睇翻，你都唔拎出嚟同我哋講啦，唔主動拎出嚟，其實。

349
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,720
唔好講你最後幾多錢，呢嚿錢二百五十億好，三百億好，都係個建造費。

350
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,620
仲未計個行政費。

351
01:05:42,010 --> 01:06:02,020
究竟你做咗出嚟係要達到乜嘢嘅目標咧？我哋今朝問嚟問去咧都係冇嘅嚇，冇咩政策目標啊，就係話有好過冇咯嚇。而家唔夠啦，或者有咗咧就自然有用㗎啦。到時嚇，我我聽到就係噉樣啊，我知。

352
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:16,070
政府好想城市化，好想申請亞運會、申請奧運啦。即係如果冇呢啲噉嘅大型場館咧，就根本就好難嘅。噉就起定先嚇，他朝又可以令你城市化咧更上一層樓啦。

353
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:23,350
今日田北辰議員針對嗰個五萬座位嘅場館嗰度，都同即係政府有一個交流啦，啊！

354
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:44,180
一定唔會日日開波嘅，即係日日都有大型嘅使用嘅。咁頭先同大球場嘅對比，大球場就係一年三十日，廿四日係體育活動。噉啊，大球場就冇得比嘅嘛，大球場就唔理想，所以都冇乜人願用㗎啦。噉樣呢個數又擺埋一邊。咁好啦，呢五萬人。

355
01:06:44,180 --> 01:07:04,190
嘅座位呢個主嘅大場館，你哋又點樣估計咧？我應唔同你講係咪體育活動啊？即係頭先講Lady Gaga咧，即係Lady Gaga開到幾多晚咧？香港五萬位咧，我都係誠意。麥當娜肯嚟或者得，但係你六年後起好麥當娜都退休咧，就都未都都唔知有邊個香港歌星敢去開呢個五？

356
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:24,200
五萬座位嘅一個表演場館，所以除咗係籃球賽，除咗係一啲外國嘅有名球隊訪港嘅比賽之外，我真係睇唔到你點樣可以坐滿呢五萬個位。嗰個使用率，你哋嘅估計係點樣？個成本效。

357
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,810
點樣點樣就叫你哋覺得係合格係即係值得起值得用咧？

358
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,940
副秘書長。

359
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:51,760
Thank you, Chairman. There are quite a few questions bound up in that statement, and I'll try and unpick it a little bit. But they're all very good points that the honourable member has made. In terms of the long-term administrative cost of running this complex, the proposed mode of operation for letting the contract will be a design-build and operate.

360
01:07:51,760 --> 01:08:10,620
contract. So in fact, once the design and build have been taken care of, the future operating cost and revenue will be a matter for the future operating consortium, and this would not require, generally speaking, a further commitment of public funds for the day-to-day operation.

361
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:31,080
In terms of bidding for the Asian or the Olympic Games, clearly this is not something that the government can do. This is the prerogative of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China. Although if they were to bid, for example, for the Asian Games, they would in fact need the support of the government. However, we do not know.

362
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:51,090
At this stage, whether or not the facilities—we assume they would be—are specifically what would be required to mount such a bid. There's a lot more than simply just building a big stadium that is required in hosting events of that nature. In terms of the wider sort of policy objectives that are connected with this project, we have in fact briefed the Home Affairs panel.

363
01:08:51,090 --> 01:09:11,100
On several occasions, on the sports policy issues related specifically to this project and in general, I do apologise to the member if we have not been clear enough in articulating these objectives. I'd be very happy to go over this again with him, but it's been made very clear in our previous submission.

364
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:27,780
to the panel that that we feel that this complex does help us to take forward our objectives for promoting sport in the community, for developing elite athletes and for bringing more international sports events into Hong Kong, and as such is totally consonant with our policy for sports development. Thank you, Chen.

365
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:48,700
下一位，主席，誒，佢係未答我，好實在講五萬座位嘅場館嘅成本效益點樣至叫做合格嗰個問題。我諗，我我畀畀呢個機會你答答埋佢咧，嚇，Deputy Secretary。然後如果真係再需要跟進，再緊再第三輪，係嘛？Deputy Secretary，about the fifty thousand seat。

366
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:55,270
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, I'll ask my colleague, Ms. Law, to answer this question. Principal Assistant Secretary.

367
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:56,730
work concert。

368
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:17,060
雖然即係我哋喺啊，就誒走少少嗰陣時咧，係做過一啲誒顧問初步嘅顧問研究。咁其中咧就主要都會睇到咧，就係誒幾個係主要嘅三個主要嘅體育場所喺呢一個園區入面，包括嗰個主場館嗰個使用率係點。咁咧喺呢個誒，即係嗰個誒我。

369
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:37,070
我哋嘅顧問研究入面咧，都係有層有一個誒大概嘅一個誒層有一個估誒一個推算啦。但係當然咧，呢啲都係就係誒根據現時嗰個體育狀況啦。我哋誒同埋現時各種誒城市喺亞亞洲區舉行嘅狀況啦。咁隨住我哋睇到成個大嘅。

370
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:48,930
趨勢咧，其實呢個狀況係越誒，即係越來越多。噉你而家個狀況係點？一個推算狀況。嚇，噉我，不如我稍為誒講得可能講得稍為誒誒具體少少啦嚇。

371
01:10:50,520 --> 01:11:10,530
咁喺啊main stadium嚟講咧，噉就誒估即係喺一個誒誒根據而家嘅狀況估計咧，咁而家現時喺誒四萬座位嘅大球場嘅誒，我哋講緊個廿幾個比賽可以做體育誒比賽，我相信當新嘅誒誒M P S C即係新嘅啟德體育園區落成之後。

372
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:28,770
咧好多呢啲誒呢啲誒比賽咧都會咧願意得去一個新嘅場館，一個更加多人誒多座位同埋一個設施更加新嘅誒場館去做嘅。譬如話，我哋見到啲Hong Kong Seven每一年佢都係爆滿夾爆滿嘅。如果有一個更大嘅場館，我哋相信呢廿幾個比賽有幾多個係爆滿？

373
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:37,480
誒呢日爆滿，誒就誒Hong Kong Seven係爆滿啦。咁當有外隊嚟香港比賽嗰時，都係爆滿。

374
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,680
我係足球迷嚟嘅喎。

375
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:53,110
啊，咁啦，好嘛，阿陳議員，可唔可以睇文件啊？比如佢有，係咯，係咯，我諗你噉樣喺度盤問咧，其實個場合唔係好適合啊嚇。啊，或者誒，可唔可以我哋請阿？

376
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:08,180
首席助理秘書長咧提供一個文件去回應陳志全議員。其實頭先田北辰議員都有問過相關。係係，其實係都有幾位議員有問過嘅嚇，可以嘛？啊啊，Deputy Secretary。

377
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:21,840
Could you make that available? Yes, we'd be happy to provide some more detailed figures on the events that have completely filled the Hong Kong Stadium and other venues to capacity, say in the last three years.

378
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:32,010
我希望， deputy secretary， 你會 have appreciated by now， that the PwC is worried about taking a leap in the dark.

379
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:38,350
And having taken the first leap, it may be a leap of no return.

380
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,030
國家奇遇。

381
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:42,870
主席。

382
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,790
二百五十億。

383
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:59,590
大家都知道咧，呢個一個天文嘅數字，我就唔係好明喺一個長區咧要用二百五十億嗰個道理喺邊，所以我都好希望佢咧交一啲詳細少少。咁當然佢一定話咩都顧問嘅，但係我諗政府有個數嘅。

384
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:10,980
我哋咧咁多年，講緊喺社區嗰度等個室內運動場，等個等一個小到不得了嗰啲嘅足球場，都唔知等幾耐。

385
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:25,490
而家咧就使二百五十億去做呢一個超級嘅誒場館啦。我仲記得咧，主席嘅發緊燒嗰陣時做嘅嗰陣時咧，話要日日要up亞運，我同你喺立法會嗰度都記記得㗎啦。

386
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:31,510
有人發緊燒咯，就話要做呢個亞運啊嘛，噉啊就整個呢一個場區出嚟。

387
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:47,240
即係我就唔希望咧，政府就喺度發燒啦。因為最重要咧，使呢一筆錢咧，第一係一個好大嘅數嚟嘅。第二咧，更加令即係真係有心體育嘅人士咧，係覺得係好即係好諷刺嘅。

388
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,280
我哋啲精英運動員咧。

389
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,700
係冇乜出路。

390
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:56,990
做完精英運動員之後咧，好多咧都係黯然要離開。

391
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:17,290
越嚟越多嘅咧，佢哋譬如如果要計分嘅話咧，就唔夠一啲輸入嘅運動員嘅，國內嚟嗰啲嚇，大家都知道咩事嘅啦。即係政府要攞牌好易嘅啫，就喺國內輸入一啲精，即係國內嗰啲五第二線、第三線嘅掟過嚟香港，噉啊做精英運動員。本地嗰啲咧機會又少到不得了嘅，長。

392
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,090
區冇訓練，冇名額，我冇乜嘢都冇。

393
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:28,340
啲小朋友揾個波地踢波都冇嘅，個政府就而家二百五十億掟落去做呢個超級嘅體育城。

394
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:32,560
究竟一年有幾多日？有呢個盛事啊！

395
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:41,450
我成日聽嚟聽去就《Rubby Seven》攞最叻㗎啦，嗰個唔係其實你話佢體育項目又唔話得錯，但係基本上係一個旅遊項目嚟㗎。

396
01:14:42,200 --> 01:15:00,630
係，其實即係欖球總會嘅誒，佢哋得即係有得於咁多年嘅錢咧。其實佢好多錢去做社區嘅一啲嘅教育，我都知好多啲就算基層地區咧，都有啲小朋友入去嗰啲訓練班。但係呢個欖球唔係所有嘅全保嘛。

397
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,030
我哋幾時啊？有個足球賽可以坐到五萬人㗎？

398
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,270
政府嗰啲噉嘅同足總搞嗰啲大龍鳳嗰啲咩鳳凰計劃？

399
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:20,450
即係真係攞出嚟，我哋都笑大人個口。我哋有幾可做一個體育政策，係有噉嘅資格去撐得起呢個場啊！

400
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,190
到頭來，我嚟開演唱會咯。

401
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:35,950
開城事咧，政府又發燒啦。最緊要而家要make event啊嘛，城事乜嘢都城事就得㗎啦。好似有城事又解決個問題，城事解決唔到個體育問題㗎。

402
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:46,750
大部分嗰早幾日喺立法會傾，嗰個教育局局長行埋嚟，我哋話喂，可唔可以多翻少少嘅體育堂？佢都話：唉，我無能為力。

403
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:54,440
我哋嘅學童啊，嗰個體能同埋個體育嗰個參與度咧，亞洲之低。

404
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:01,710
政府冇一個完善嘅體育政策，同教育局又冇做過嘢，而家出嚟就攞二百五十億。

405
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:10,040
做個盛盛大嘅場館，噉啊，等於香港誒做咗一個體育嘅運動，講笑咩？

406
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:15,520
即係好難去阻你。你話啊，我做體育活動，但係大家都心知肚明咧。

407
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:24,110
係打種嘅麪皮充闊腦，唔係香港冇錢。咁當然香港咧就個政府對一啲窮人咧就好。

408
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:28,850
即係好離譜嘅嚇，即係譬如如果你話二百五十億。

409
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,720
五六間醫院啦，係咪啊？政府唔起住。

410
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:44,590
好多個老人院冇錢起安老服務冇，我都唔同你講嗰啲啦。喺個社區嗰度係多啲嘅社區嘅體育設備，政府都唔肯攞出嚟。

411
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,380
主席，我第二輪先要佢答。

412
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,710
陳婉嫺議員。

413
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:59,030
主席，我跟呢件事跟咗好耐。我同啊，我我來過，因為我跟就起碼成個機場搬走有超過廿年。

414
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,070
咁而呢個體育館咧，我哋亦都經歷過嘅。

415
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:12,750
就經歷咗呢十幾廿年嘅過程當中咧，當初我都好似今日同事講，點解起咁大等等等，但當我去到三區，因為牽涉黃大仙、觀塘同埋土瓜灣。

416
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:26,670
所有居民都話：佢哋嗰度冇大型嘅場地，所以佢哋係support住啲計劃。嗱，如果從我哋最初睇個計劃嘅時候咧，我哋要提出：喂，需唔需要咁大噉樣？咁嗰陣時淨係阿阿阿霍振庭。

417
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:32,410
係嘛喺立法會噉，佢嗰陣時講好多，噉我亦都聽咗精英嘅講嘢。

418
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,940
長毛，你聽人講嘅嘢先得嘅。

419
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:40,110
咁所以變咗噉嘅情況咧，誒，我覺得都係需要嘅。

420
01:17:40,420 --> 01:18:00,430
以至我哋話誒沿海一大一成個舊機場嘅規劃，我都有份參與嘅。咁所以就話對於當時嘅設計咧，我哋大致上都經咗好多好多輪嘅諮詢，亦都聽咗好多地區意見。咁所以大家就覺得係需要嘅話，我哋支持嘅。不過我會有啲嘢提翻出嚟，即係我最近聽到話。

421
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:05,600
話咧，你原來沿住九龍灣嗰個即係電車單車徑啊！

422
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:26,140
你好似話唔畀啲人入去啊嘛？我唔係咁明。你知道我哋原來嘅成個啟德發展咧，都從三個區連接嘅。而呢個連接咧，曾經我犯招分時仲係做緊政府官員，我唔記得邊個局，佢就話畀我聽，十三街咧將會搞成一個叫體育城啊！你諗幾耐世紀啊？咁即係話當時有個大嘅規劃考慮。

423
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:46,150
要配套好多嘢等等，咁所以你發覺你嗰個係成個運動場嘅周遭嗰啲嗰啲地下嘅誒車站啊，同九龍城同呢個係誒土瓜灣等等嘅接觸咧，係比較強嘅嗰邊。你睇到嘅好多天橋、好多地下街等等等等等等嘅，都係諗住當時有成個一個咁大嘅運動場咧，要有啲。

424
01:18:46,150 --> 01:19:06,160
人流人可以行入去，出嚟嘅人散場時亦都迅速散場，以致我哋當時提到話，如果個咁大場所，我哋好擔心廢氣好大，所以要求要喺嗰個呢個大型嘅體育場下底咧做呢個停車。咁而家後路都聽我意見啦。再加上好似有風吹入九龍城嘅，所以因此體管係。

425
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:18,820
下降，佢唔係佢咪從地面噉樣噉樣誒起一樓二樓噉樣，係下沉一啲嘅。呢個基於個風速嘅問題，咁所以我就都想同同事解釋咧，即係我喺誒呢個區跟咗咁耐咧。

426
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:39,410
成個過程係多次喺唔同嘅區會，多次喺地區，包括多次同好多嘅體育界傾嘅問題，我覺得係應該要支持嘅。當然各有各嘅諗法唔同啦，但我就想講，在跟咗成廿年嘅體育發展嘅我咧，我覺得都想講翻剛才呢番説話。咁所以點解前階段當

427
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:59,420
啲界政府話唔夠樓咧，要喺啟德側邊嗰啲誒嗰啲主場館側邊嗰度咧起樓，我你唔好制啊！嗰度通風重要地方嚟嘅，唔好亂咁嚟我話。咁所以當時我立法我都講，咁所以我就想講翻誒誒，佢呢個體育館係有住體育界意見，有住精英運動員意見，有住地區嘅意見，有住一隻好。

428
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:19,430
愛呢個地區嘅人，佢哋嘅設計嘅發展提咗好多好多意見喺度，咁所以大致上我同意嘅。不過我始終正佢答我，到底我哋當時千方百計騰空地方畀一條叫單車徑，我一早好多好耐已經同人講中踩單車，將嗰度好靚㗎噉樣。如果你又唔畀單車入咧，我哋絕對唔同意。而家有多路。

429
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:39,440
佢哋入去裏邊設一第二個咧，大家都知道啊。主席而家土瓜環發現咗好多誒一啲古嘅古跡。咁再加上早期規劃嘅時候咧，由於發現咗嗰個係接官亭啊，即係啟德河龍津河接官亭同埋條橋噉，所以當時咧政府就應承我哋咧，就由個接官亭嗰個起位嘅尾橋尾。

430
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:59,450
有條隧道一路過到去而家嘅J初古蹟嗰度，一大堆古嘅古蹟。嗱，你而家呢段寫咧係唔公道嘅。你嗰度填海嗰度唔係好多古蹟，我擔心你啊！你而家知唔知道而家喺土光環咧？誒呢個誒誒北帝街同埋個南角道，即係九龍城啊！我哋原來有條隧道過。

431
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:19,460
過去我哋嘅北帝街，點知而家發現好多古蹟停咗樹。你而家跟住就話：哦，嗰度可能冇古蹟。嗱，我我想唔好從到高鐵嘅復捷。噉你最初做工程，哦，唔會有古蹟嘅個評估，之後就發現咗好多好多重要，可能影響海上絲路嘅好重要。噉我連問兩個問題，一個問題就係嗰條。

432
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:26,720
單車徑係點先？係咪改變初衝？第二個，如果而家有翻古跡，係咪而家咁簡單段就算數咧？兩個問題。

433
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:47,500
Deputy Secretary, Chairman, very very quickly in response to the two questions, the cycle track, which is linking up East Kowloon as a whole, will go through the site of the future sports complex. In fact, in the indicative layout plan that's attached to the paper, it may not be very clear, but we have actually.

434
01:21:47,500 --> 01:22:07,510
已 shown an alignment for the cycle track which will go through the complex and which will be connected up with the entire cycling network in Kaitak. And we're working with the colleagues in charge of the overall Kaitak development to make sure that that will work as a connected up cycle track in the area. In terms of the antiquities, we are.

435
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:28,270
At this stage, quite confident that within the site for this particular sports complex, there appear to be no antiquities at all. You're quite right in saying that in other areas of Kaitaek, there have been a large number of relics. Some of them of great historical value found, but certainly within the site for this project, we are not aware of anything.

436
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,260
similar. Thank you.

437
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:49,790
誒主席，我雖然剛才誒咁答我啦，不過我仍然即民政嗰邊答咧，我仍然好強調。我講單車徑咧就話，我哋如果而家有連接路入咗去嘅土瓜灣有誒，呢個東華村有，將來嘅牛頭角嗰邊，將來再去埋觀塘，觀塘仲未傾掂嗰啲橋係點樣，都有地方入。

438
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:50,360
佢嘅。

439
01:22:50,650 --> 01:23:03,850
如果我坐喺屋出邊踩單車入嚟係可以O K嘛？正還是話唔畀一啲噉嘅過路人人士推單車踩？如果係咁咧，我諗我就即係誒好有意見啦！傾咗好耐啊，呢條線唔該。

440
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:24,340
Chairman, there will be our intention is that there should be seamless access into and out of the site for pedestrians and for cycles. No fees charged, no blocks at all. It should be a steady and continuous route for cyclists and pedestrians alike through the site, whether from Tukwana side, from Kalund.

441
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,520
City side， or from the旺泰斯inside。

442
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:47,010
我想問咧，單車徑嗰度咧頭到尾會有啲好似誒日本啊、台灣啊、中國有啲單車站嗰存放站存放咧。嗱，例如我哋有啲人喺附近翻工，誒將來好多商業大廈，你知道成個三百幾公頃上高有好多商業大廈。例如有啲人踩單車喺嗰度，你畀個站人爬樹放咗陣單車走幾好啊？主就係正㗎。咁而今日提有。

443
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:51,940
我哋設施咧，即係學台灣、學東京、學中國噉樣，有冇諗過咧？

444
01:23:52,770 --> 01:24:12,780
陳先生答答埋呢個啦。如果你再跟，要再排啦，係嘛？Deputy Secretary, yes, certainly, Chairman. Yes, I mean the, yep, the cycling networks in in in Japan, in in Taiwan, very very successful. The overall design of the cycling network throughout KitaK is is a matter for the Civil Engineering Development Department. However.

445
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:27,580
Within the site that we are seeking the funding for today, there will be space certainly for providing the parking areas for rental bicycles. If if that is what is required, there would certainly be enough space to do that.

446
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,620
陶瑾新業。

447
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:38,020
朱姐，誒剛剛才咧，我聽咗好詳細，聽咗同事啊，同埋教早前嘅資料咧，我覺得我都係好擔心咧，而家呢個。

448
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,100
誒工程咧，就係一個大白仗嚟嘅。

449
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:48,140
就誒阿陳玉衡議員咧，佢誒佢話咧就居民咧就好支持呢個大型場地。

450
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,890
即係地區嘅居民咧，我知我先知。

451
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:55,860
咁當然你話體育界咧，都即係都係居民嚟嘅，體育界都有都係喺度住嘅。

452
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:06,610
不過，你話如果居民地區嘅居民咧，佢所需要咧就唔係一個五萬人嘅場地，佢需要嗰啲咧就係誒分散嘅一啲比較細啲嘅場地。

453
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:17,050
咁當然我知道體育界咧係係希望有有啲大型嘅場地，但係我哋一定要諗咧，就係話我哋咁起嘅係咩size？

454
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:28,540
同埋我哋而家有嘅有啲乜嘢係可以，例如佢如果分散得到嘅時候，係咪可以咧？一而家嘅萬五人嗰啲場地，係咪可以有啲用得好啲咧？咁？

455
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,600
那。

456
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,210
我希望問政府咧，就係噉樣。

457
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,460
誒。

458
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,970
你哋預計啊！

459
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:39,810
暫時啦嚇，初初步啦嚇，即係唔唔計呢筆撥款嘅嘅嘅研究。

460
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,130
你哋要需要一個五萬人嘅場地。

461
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:52,420
嘅體育嘅event，即係嗰啲嗰啲誒比賽啊，嗰啲係一年佔幾多日到咧？

462
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:57,320
即係你預計，OK啊？粗略預計都得，唔緊要嚇。啊，你夠膽講就得㗎啦。

463
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,680
噉啊，其他活動。

464
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:20,020
即係體育以外嘅嗱，我唔理你演唱會咩都好啦嚇，夾埋曬啊，就需要五萬人嘅場地。O K嗱，當然啦，如果你話誒我需要誒八千人嘅咁噉，你可以呢？而家係有有有其他場地得啊，係嘛？但係即係大致上，你應該係估計咧，譬如係超過萬五人嘅。O K。

465
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,410
而係五五萬人以內嘅，萬人以上嘅。

466
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:24,990
今日啲乜嘢？

467
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:29,390
誒活動係佔大約幾多日到咧？粗略估計得啦，OK。

468
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:39,700
因為我諗到咧，就係啊，當然啦，誒民民建聯A.G.M咧，應該就要嘅啊，因為佢哋超過萬人嘅，好似會員，即係如果佢哋有人一票嘅時候。

469
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:54,090
咁所以咧就誒當然，如果係共產黨香港黨大會咧，啊佢哋又肯即係現身嘅咧，噉啊，咁應該都都應該有幾萬人嘅，我相信嚇。噉啊，咁但係咧，即係除此之外，咁有啲乜嘢其他活動佔幾多入到咧？

470
01:26:54,370 --> 01:27:04,390
估計係啊，有冇粗略嘅估計咧？抑或係你而家話畀我聽就係完全冇估計，我就係要請攞六千萬嚟估計下啦。噉係咪咁咧？

471
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,900
副秘書長。

472
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:26,310
Chairman, thank you. It is a good question, but I do feel I need to clarify a point first that we've made many times in our presentations to the Home Affairs Panel, and that is that the MPSC, the Multi-Purpose Sports Complex at Kaitaek, is not simply about building a single 50,000-seat main stadium. It is in fact about

473
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:46,320
Outbuilding a whole suite of sports facilities, the great majority of which will be public sports facilities open to the public seven days a week, thirty six five, three hundred and sixty five days a year. The main stadium is one of the components of this sports complex, albeit a very major component. As regards

474
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,880
the events.

475
01:27:48,250 --> 01:28:08,260
That would take place in the main stadium itself. Clearly, I'm sure many people are aware that in the past, the current Hong Kong stadium has been unable to meet the demand for tickets for many major events, primarily international rugby and football events that have taken place, and this has

476
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:28,270
Led obviously to problems such as ticket touting and scalping, and to increases in prices and many people not being able to get into the events. Equally, many of the events that are held at the current Hong Kong stadium are held there because the stadium is the only venue that meets the international sports requirements, not just in terms of the capacity.

477
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:48,280
of the ground, but in terms of the backup and support services, and even at this level, it is not sufficient for some types of major event. So, in addition to providing the additional seating capacity, the proposed main stadium at the complex in Kaitaek would also have the additional features that we would need to be able to host a wider range of.

478
01:28:48,280 --> 01:29:08,290
international events, we would certainly, as we've undertaken earlier this morning, Chairman, be prepared to provide more detailed figures on the actual events at the current Hong Kong stadium that have attracted full crowds of 40,000 people, and also the crowds that have attended other events at the stadium in, say, the last three years. We'd be very happy to provide this. But just one more.

479
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:28,300
Clarification, Chairman. We have to plan on the basis of the peak demand for the facility, just as you do for any other facility. There will be times when there will be events that will be held at the new main stadium, as with the current Hong Kong stadium, where you will not fill all the seats. You may have twenty zero people. You may have just ten zero people.

480
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:40,710
But we need to also plan for those times when there will be demand for 50,000 tickets, events that Hong Kong people really want to see and which currently they are not able to see, given the lack of sports infrastructure that we have.

481
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:45,500
主席，我正正嘅問題就係咧，我都話當啊，我當咧。

482
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,600
而家有啲係萬五以上，而係個peak咧就係去到五萬嘅噉。

483
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,090
噉你可唔可以估估計下？基於而家有其他嘅。

484
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,160
誒場地嘅不足。

485
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,920
咁然後估計係，然後話畀我聽，有幾多入到咧？

486
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:05,020
係三十啊，一係八十咧。

487
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,980
因為二十咧。

488
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:16,460
即係我哋必須要要要用呢個角度嚟嚟衡量，究竟我哋嗱，我唔係話如果一年係只係有五日係需要五萬個人嘅啫。

489
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,630
我未必唔起嘅。

490
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:39,110
即係，但係我哋要心理準備咧，就係呢個就係我哋願意擺嗰二百幾億或者更多落去，就係有一個capacity係有機會再多啲，有機會五五萬嘅噉啊。不過五日咧就我哋預計咗㗎啦，咁即係起碼都有個即係市民都有有一個決定，立法會議員去批款都有有有個基礎。

491
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:43,840
就唔係唔係話我哋話啊！我哋純粹空白嘅咁嚟批。

492
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:48,640
就希望會第時會有五萬啦，噉樣有啲使用。

493
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:58,420
副秘書長，我認為你説在跟進文件中，你承諾會提供這些資訊，係咪？

494
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:17,870
Chairman, that is that is absolutely correct. And rather than speculate, which I don't feel very comfortable doing at all, I'd prefer to provide hard evidence of events where there have been documented numbers of people going to events, both in Hong Kong and similar events in neighbouring cities in Asia. If that would help to provide additional clarification.

495
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,420
O.K.

496
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,030
陳偉業議員。

497
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:41,340
嗱，主席，即係我坐喺度成個鐘頭聽政府即係答問題啦。噉就誒，基本上咧，如果你睇文件咧，即係以一個大型基建計劃嚟講咧，涉及到二十八公頃嘅土地，可能用數以百億咧。呢份文件嘅粗疏同埋資料嘅缺乏咧，可以話係歷來之最。

498
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:45,970
如果議員咁都話可以過關嘅話咧，呢個係完全失職嘅。

499
01:31:46,250 --> 01:32:04,710
嗱，呢個計劃涉及到三個主要嘅問題，主席一個咧就係有關呢個嘅工程建設費嘅問題。如果你話二零一零年估價係二百五十億咧，你到到做完呢個研究，你二零一八動工嘅話咧，嗰個完工價咧一定過五百億。

500
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:11,260
啊！你睇翻過去嗰個工程價格嘅上升咧，你冇五百億係賣唔到單。

501
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:31,670
第二就係喂，究竟呢一個嘅工程，呢一個嘅所謂體育項目係為乜嘢體育而設？個目標係點樣？政府係完全冇交代解釋嘅，係咪？一般呢啲大型體育館就係以足球或者欖球為主啦。喂，香港嘅足球倒退到家下，即係連呢個台灣都不如啊！當年。

502
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:36,770
嘅足球王國，亞洲嘅足球王國，家下變咗呢個足球水魚啊！

503
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:57,060
咁所以即係你見到家下現時噉嘅情況，你個體育架構一日唔改善，足總一日唔改革，香港足運冇前途嘅。所以你睇翻現時嘅體育架構，你繼續去咁做嘅話咧，你係係製造即係表演場地、演藝場地就唔係體育。唔該喺西九做就唔好喺呢個啟德做。第三個主要問題就係嗰個。

504
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:11,290
土地用途涉及到二十八公頃嘅土地咧，主席，如果你用呢個嘅地積比率九計算咧，九龍啲建築面積九計算咧，如果改做自住宅咧，可以起四萬五千個六百尺單位啊！

505
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,000
係政府呢個建屋嘅兩年嘅數量啊！

506
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:35,380
你政府啲梁振英成日話揾地，係嘛？連呢個嘅浸會大學一個地盤一個誒，即係一個地盤八百起可以起八百個單位嘅地方咧，都同呢一個嘅浸會打兩年仗。呢度可以起四萬五千個單位，你可以就噉樣放。

507
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:48,110
好多議員咧就唔係好記得歷史，呢一個啟德體育城係當年董建華選特首嘅時候應承霍震霆嘅體呢個嘅政治交易。

508
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,300
而確定嘅。

509
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:58,700
我知道政府過去十幾年覺得呢個規劃錯嘅，唔應該喺度起嘅，但係轉嚟轉去轉嚟轉去冇人夠膽否決，係嘛？

510
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:18,610
頭先陳婉嫻講呢一個好似係黃大仙觀塘呢個九龍城嘅計劃，呢個係全港嘅計劃嚟㗎，唔係地區性計劃嚟㗎。唔該啲議員醒下睇下啦，一個全港性計劃擺喺呢一個嘅啟德，由開始到今日我都堅決反對呢個計劃，因為規劃上嘅錯誤。

511
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:24,510
啟德係香港最後一幅大型嘅市區用地。

512
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:32,840
最後一幅㗎啦！你用二十八公頃去起一個大白帳，唔知做乜嘢體育運動嘅體育城？

513
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,430
去到成五百億嘅開支，都未計行政費啊！

514
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:45,780
如果大家睇翻歷史，過去嗰十幾年香港政府喺規劃上嘅錯誤係歷來從未試過嘅。

515
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,850
高鐵就變呢一個嘅低鐵。

516
01:34:49,130 --> 01:35:09,140
係嘛喺一個嘅超級嘅遊輪碼頭就完全係空置嘅西九講咗十幾年係嘛嗰個嘅建築成本咧都唔知爆到去邊一度。喂，一而再，再而三，我哋睇到啲計劃，你連起呢一個嘅港珠澳大橋，嗰個連接都出現問題啊！

517
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:23,880
啲啲好基本嘅技術錯誤都出現問題啊！咁所以喺嗰個概念上、土地用途上、體育發展上、成本效益上，完全文件冇交代嘅。啲議員話支持。

518
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:33,650
所以主席，我一定話畀政府聽，我一定會極力反對呢一個項目嘅通過。我一陣間排隊再問地月亮主席。

519
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,940
唔好，你唔好，你唔好想，你唔好諗住今日可以過啊！

520
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,750
梁國雄議員，主席。

521
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:43,350
誒五萬人上座嘅活動啦，畀你聽。

522
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,920
係冇嘅，我係足球迷。

523
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,600
今年嘅賀歲波一萬人。

524
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,330
仲要派飛。

525
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:56,920
我哋又加入唔到呢個中超，我哋都唔想加入，因為大陸太多假波。

526
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:02,140
你你又真喂，真係如果霍振廷仲係做緊？

527
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:11,960
即係仲係在朝嘅話，可能仲食中即係誒誒加入咗中超，仲話每每隔一個禮拜打一場主場波啊，嗰。

528
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:19,080
即係你五萬人嘅嘢rock concert咯，噉你又唔得啊！

529
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:23,650
你又唔得喎！而家你都唔要外國客咯。

530
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:33,470
有幾樣嘅嗱，我就我就睇嗰套戲，我唔知呢位觀眾你年青，我有冇睇過一套咧，就係講智利嘅戲。

531
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:52,700
一九誒七三年軍事政變就冇地方揾政治犯，噉就嗰個聖地牙哥大球場咧，就全部趕曬入去，唔使講嘢。你入咗去就係政治犯，咁有用咯。將來有機會㗎，再佔領中環嘅時候，噉就喺你咁中意佔領中環。

532
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:57,830
咪佔領西誒誒東九啦。第二就係。

533
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,290
梁振英如果仲有命嘅話，

534
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:05,810
就整個誒愛國少年軍嗰度檢閲，太hit啦噉樣。

535
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,340
咁咪得咯。

536
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:11,700
喂，哥，你哋都有去旅遊㗎。

537
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:15,110
大把外國嘅大白象啦～

538
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,690
等曬喺度啦！

539
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:25,460
係咪啊？人哋都用商業原則啊，先揾咗錢先啊嘛。噉就當然你所有原原則即係都係揾大家笨㗎啦。

540
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:28,090
但係都收咗錢先啦，而家我哋呢個。

541
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,880
純粹係玩具嚟嘅。

542
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,890
各位長官。

543
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:38,600
你會唔會買間屋？每年只係住兩個鐘頭。

544
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,710
仲要燈油火蠟。

545
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,030
會唔會啊？如果你自己，

546
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,940
梗係唔會啦。

547
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,860
你就受公堂㗎嘛？

548
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,020
明知樣嘢不可行。

549
01:37:52,910 --> 01:38:00,810
呢一樣嘢係董建華籌容嘅之作，醒神之作。喂，呢個迪士尼樂園又係啊！

550
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:14,280
有政治危機咁咪整嘢嚟沖起咯！而家個迪士尼樂園又就好笑啊！啲地啊曬到乾曬，因為上海有個迪士尼樂園，我哋都唔知用唔用嗰六十公頃嘅地，嗰度填出嚟個二百幾億㗎哥。

551
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:24,050
當年餘忠義話：喂，嗰度係海嚟㗎，所以唔應該計落去。我哋話：喂，填咗要填要要成本㗎嘛？你哋呢啲噉嘅大白象仲唔夠多咩？

552
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,310
我就係問你機設嗰個問題，答唔答到都答唔到㗎嘛？

553
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:47,310
即係你估計嘅嘢係完全係呃啲善良嘅市民。老實講，機會成本㗎嘛。你問呢個東九龍嘅起多啲院，起多啲院社，唔好話起公屋啦，起多啲院社，起多啲老人中心，起一間牙醫中心。

554
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:57,780
即係慳啲啊！你話要運動完有運動創傷學嘅醫院，真係有用㗎。你運動創傷學荷蘭做到嘭嘭聲。

555
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,260
你都明啊！

556
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:11,200
你你咁先係做嘢㗎嘛？喂，整個五五萬人嘅嘅球場，日日日日日擺喺度。喂，大佬要維修㗎，要保養㗎嗰。

557
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:24,450
你都知道啦，巴西嗰個球場坐二十萬，個冧啊！成日都一九五零年起咗嚟做世界盃嗰個決賽場地。而家唔係A看台冧就B看台冧，唔係B看台冧咪C看台冧。

558
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:25,680
喂。

559
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,040
即係我覺得。

560
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:35,470
如果大家覺得可以忍心咁畀錢出去嘅，噉我我就冇嘢講啊！而家我哋講緊啊～

561
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:39,400
救下嗰啲五無人士啊！都話冇錢啊！

562
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,600
佢有機會去嗰度咩？

563
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:48,010
佢有機會有錢去嗰度咩？咁貴！

564
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:50,830
要搭地鐵先去得。

565
01:39:52,550 --> 01:40:02,670
好啦，噉我理解梁宇。我我問我問佢，我問嗰位誒嗰位外籍人士，到底有你你有冇統計數據？有邊一場波係過五萬過五萬嘅？

566
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:23,110
唔係喺香港有資歷。梁宇仁，頭先阿麥敬廉先生咧就話咗，佢會補交文件嚟嘅，就會將嗰啲即係超過萬五啊、五萬啊嗰啲項目咧，就會列個清單。馬會咯，清單畀我哋嘅。Raising咯。啊啊，咁嗰個你等嗰個文件啦，好冇？啊。OK。啊。

567
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:43,140
嗱，我啊，我哋歡迎啊馬逢國議員。噉啊，你亦都係相關界別啦。噉我就由於你係第一輪，誒想發言咧，我就想畀你誒先講，然後先至排緊第二輪嘅議員先再發問，好嘛？馬議員，誒多謝主席。

568
01:40:43,270 --> 01:41:03,280
誒，即係今次呢？即係我唔係誒呢一個委員會嘅成員啦。不過我就比較關注呢個議題嘅。咁誒，即係啟德園區其實提咗出嚟反反覆覆咧，即係中間亦都曾經試過政府話考慮要搬遷啦。噉我諗業界嗰個意見就係好清晰㗎啦，已經表達咗，就希望咧即係盡快要。

569
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:21,890
要去做嘅，咁誒亦都係即係都對於拖延咗咁耐咧，都其實都好大嘅意見。咁所以今日試嗰個撥款咧，主要就係話為呢個園區園區嘅即係喺施工之前嘅工程去做準備咧。咁誒，我自己係非常之支持咧。咁誒，而家即係。

570
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:42,180
希望撥嘅款項都唔多啦，係去做一啲顧問研究啊、土地勘測啊噉樣噉，同埋話預計工程即係呢一呢一呢一類嘅工程，就一七年三月之前完成。噉我反而想問翻政府咧，就係做完呢一個階段嘅工程之後咧，即係政府預計正式嘅即係園區嘅建設工程係會係。

571
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:53,560
係幾時會可以動工得到咧？咁誒，亦都有冇一啲其他嘅方法咧，係可以令到呢個工程咧，唔一定需要去到二零二零或者二零二一先至做到嘅咧？噉。

572
01:41:53,840 --> 01:42:13,850
咁另外即係我都想即係誒回應翻頭先阿阿阿梁國雄議員講咧，即係話嗰個場係咪大白象咧？其實我嘅理解咧，嗰個場館咧，即係五萬人嗰個場館咧，唔單係體育嘅需要，唔單係即係一啲大型嘅嘅誒體育項目咧，係需要噉嘅場館嘅。事實上，我哋嘅一個誒，譬如話。

573
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:32,800
文化嘅設施咧，我哋喺大型音樂會嘅場地咧，都係冇嘅。咁喺呢方面咧，我都誒業界都願期望住咧，即係將來呢個場館咧，係希望能夠可以提供個場館係畀一啲大型嘅文化活動都可以用得到嘅。噉啊，希望即係政府都回應一下。多謝主席。

574
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:50,880
係咪黃立輝？

575
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:57,370
先生嚇嚇嚇，多謝主席，係誒誒，多謝主席嚇誒。

576
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:17,800
我哋呢次係申請撥款咧，係請希望係委聘顧問咧，同埋承建商咧，就係作為前期嘅研究，同埋對嗰個工地嗰個地質啊各方面咧係鑑察嘅。咁如果係得到各位誒公務小組支持，而亦都係誒財務小組即係誒財務委員會係誒即係批准咧。

577
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:38,020
咁誒，我哋呢個前期工程咧，就會喺誒今年係展開。咁希望喺誒，大約係一誒一七年三月度係完成啦。咁視乎嗰個誒研究嘅進度咧。如果一切順利咧，我哋希望誒，即係國方咧係會希望咧係喺二零一七年。

578
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:58,050
係開始呢個建造嘅工程，就喺二零二一年咧，喺完成。唔該。誒唔係呢個呢個，你文件寫咗，我就係問有冇有冇方法可以即係提早啊？係阿黃生，即係我覺得呢個都未係好理想。如果從業界嚟講，係希望能夠越早越。誒，我相信係局方嘅意願咧，都係希望係提早嘅。噉。

579
01:43:58,050 --> 01:44:18,060
咁所以都係希望今次得到各位嘅支持咧。咁但係嗰個可唔可以提早咧？因為到底係複雜，我我覺得局方都需要一個比較審慎嘅研究，唔希望話隨隨便便噉樣係做一個好即係比較膚淺嘅研究咧。咁所以我我覺得我哋應該係跟翻足嗰個程序同埋嗰個工程嗰個要求去做嚇，咁去盡量希望。

580
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:36,310
哦，咁如果可以嘅，希望提早。係唔該曬。咁另外，我第二個問題就係話，即係其實誒唔單止係體育界係要求嗰個場館有噉嘅即係規模同埋嗰個座位啦，係誒文化界、演藝界其實都有呢個噉嘅訴求嘅。即係唔知政府誒考慮嘅時候有冇都考慮埋呢樣嘢咧？

581
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,120
deputy secretary。

582
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,490
主席，多謝你。是的，這個複雜是主要。

583
01:44:42,770 --> 01:45:02,780
intended to be a sports complex, but of course some of the areas within the within the complex may indeed be suitable for use as entertainment, cultural, exhibition or other venues that not are not directly related to sport. In terms of the usage generally, chairman, if you just let me make one point again, and I'm sorry for repeating myself.

584
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:22,790
But this complex is not just about a fifty thousand seat main stadium. In fact, the majority of the facilities at this complex will be public sports facilities, meeting a proven need in Hong Kong, where the usage rate for public sports grounds is one hundred percent, where the usage rate for indoor sports venues regularly exceeds.

585
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:30,890
90%， and we are simply short of the kind of public facilities that will be provided as the main component of this complex. Thank you.

586
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:33,420
範國威議員。

587
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:53,710
啊！多主席，我我想誒查詢嘅問題咧，就係文件裏邊嘅第三頁誒第五點嘅嗰度講到理由嘅，就係話體育普及化、精英化、城市化係政府發展本港體育嘅三大政策目標。你可唔可以畀多資料解釋一下，如何嘅係去達至到呢三個嘅政策目標？我覺。

588
01:45:53,710 --> 01:46:02,220
舉一個例子，我自己誒工作區、行政區、行誒西貢將軍嘅嗰個起咗嗰個咪精英運動員畀誒。

589
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:22,510
單車手，全港唯一一個嘅誒訓練精英運動員，成個鑊型噉樣嘅單車手。咁嗰個好明顯就係精英化嘅一個培訓喺平日嘅日子，好少數嘅日子咧先要開放出嚟畀市民用個單車館裏邊部分嘅地方。咁即係換句話講咧，嗰個單車館嘅興建咧，其實喺硬件上邊。

590
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:42,520
咧，誒喺政策目標咧係有雙抵觸嘅，即係佢只係能夠做到精英化，唔能夠做咗普及化。普及化我理解就係好似歐洲啲國家噉樣咧，嗰啲嘅體育設施咧就唔係一個好巨型嘅，反而係要細嘅，未必係標準化。誒多而散落地喺唔同嘅社區裏邊，讓市民。

591
01:46:42,520 --> 01:47:02,530
更容易地係去接觸使用得到呢啲體育設施，噉我就想問啦，你哋到底係去推動呢個叫做普及化、精英化、城市化，你哋點樣去定一啲嘅誒政策量度量化嘅指標喺呢個噉樣嘅誒啟德呢個嘅體育園起好咗之後係去？

592
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:03,980
即係去打字嘅。

593
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,910
deputy secretary。

594
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:26,360
Thank you, Chairman. It's a very good question, and obviously it's something that we we need to make sure that we do in planning a project of this nature. It has to be absolutely consonant with our policy objectives for sports development. I can only answer very very briefly here, but but would be happy to go into this in more detail at a panel meeting or separately. In terms of sports

595
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,460
promotion， as I've said on a couple of occasions.

596
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:49,800
One of the main issues that we face in promoting sport in the wider community is the shortage of venues for public recreation, public training, public competition, or casual sports participation. Within the sports complex, we will provide a new public sports ground, which will be primarily for public use.

597
01:47:49,800 --> 01:48:09,810
So it would be able to be used as, for example, the Hammerhill Sports Ground is now for public jogging, for public to book spaces for football matches, etc. So that would be a new public venue. The indoor facility, the indoor sports facility that will be part of the complex, again primarily will be for use by the public. There will be two indoor arenas.

598
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:29,820
suitable for playing all sorts of indoor sports, whether they're racket sports such as as badminton, table tennis, or martial arts sports, gymnastics, other sports of this nature. And also within the site, there is scope for developing a number of outdoor facilities for sports such as beach volleyball, tennis. There will be a cycling track going through. There will be

599
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:39,570
jogging tracks. So generally speaking, within that complex, there will be a lot of facilities that will complement our efforts to promote sport more widely in the community.

600
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:59,860
在terms of the elite sports development， clearly some of the higher level venues that will be provided at this complex will give athletes at the higher end of the performance spectrum new facilities in which to train， but will also allow them to take part in international events， more international events that we will bring to Hong Kong， taking part in international

601
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:19,870
National events in your home city does give a major advantage to athletes, and it will allow more local Hong Kong athletes to take part in such international level competitions. Finally, in respect of the promotion of Hong Kong as a destination for major sports events, currently our infrastructure for such sports events is

602
01:49:19,870 --> 01:49:39,880
falling very much behind the standards that are expected in today's international competitive field. We have seen many other facilities opening around the region that are attracting these events. We are concerned that unless Hong Kong upgrades its sports infrastructure for such events, we will lose some of the major flagship international sports events that we currently have. So in this

603
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:51,290
This way, and this is just a very superficial explanation that I'm allowed. We are confident that this project will be consistent with our overall objectives for sports policy. Thank you.

604
01:49:54,100 --> 01:50:14,110
嗱，各位委員，而家咧喺我席前咧正在輪候發言嘅有第二輪嘅郭嘉琪、馬逢國，我理解陳偉業議員你係排緊第二輪啊嘛，係嘛？嚇，咁然後第三輪嘅胡志偉，嗱，而家距離誒十點半。

605
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:27,200
換咧只係有四分鐘，咁咧我就而家諗緊，即係加到十點四十五咧，會唔會投到票啫？如果唔係咧，今日係大會，所以我就唔想即係逼迫得大家咁緊要。

606
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,460
大家係咪覺得？

607
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:43,320
嚇，因為其實四位咧就都勉強到嘅，但係如果你即係再冇其他嘅委員可以嘗試嘅，但係你哋啊啊，石禮謙議員。

608
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:58,380
誒，我哋嘅時間係加翻時間落去，可以搭曬，可以做到投票嘅。我哋應該係進行去做以上呢件事。我哋仲有好多等候，我哋投票嘅主席。嗱，四位咧就係十六分鐘。

609
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:01,310
哦。

610
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:10,500
啊好啦好啦啊！而家其實我就咁睇人數已經係超過咗誒十五分鐘啦嚇，噉。

611
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,090
嚇！

612
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,680
哦。

613
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:19,540
好啦，好啦，我我我加，我加，我加，我加。

614
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:20,450
三十個。

615
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:24,660
你有三十二A啊？係啊。哦，嗯。

616
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:30,860
唔係，但係但係就誒，本證係未收到嘅。我知未需要住啊嘛，主席。

617
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:41,980
好啦，咁誒，因為咧，其實如果有誒委員咧係反對咧，我都係不能夠加時間嘅嚇。根根據我哋PWSC嘅議事規則。

618
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:44,180
大多數。

619
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:58,170
哦，話誒秘書提我咧就係大多數誒，以大多數為準。噉，使唔使時一時二啊？即係誒反對我家時嘅誒，大家可以表一表態啦。

620
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,000
