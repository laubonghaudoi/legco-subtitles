1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,880
誒，各位。

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:23,640
誒有關二零一三年十一月廿二號小組委員會建議前往呢個東鐵線同埋馬鞍山線嘅車站試察呢個加裝月台閘門工程嘅進展咧，就秘書處已經同我哋聯絡咗啦，就安排喺誒稍後嘅一月十號。

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,200
星期五。

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:42,900
誒，即係下星期五啦，前往沙田嗰個貨運場同埋馬場站進行有關視察嘅。噉啊，請大家參考琴日發出嘅通告，就儘量出席係啦。呢度都要呼籲大家就即係有機會去睇一睇啦，因為我哋都叫咗好耐啦呢樣嘢。

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,040
跟住落嚟咧，就係自從上次會議後發出嘅資料文件咧，我講講咧就有兩份嘅。

6
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,400
一份咧就立法會C.B.一五五零。

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,960
就係因為市民有關香港鐵路公司嗰個列車車門安全提交意見書。

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:17,870
另外咧就係立法會文件C.B.一五九五同埋C.B.一六零二嘅，就係黃國興議員同埋郭家麒議員分別喺一三年十月十七日輕鐵事故發出嘅誒函件。

9
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,470
就啊，我哋已經要求當局啊回應有關意見書，佢話稍後會咧回覆我哋呢個小組委員會㗎。

10
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,020
噉啊，跟住落嚟咧就係今年嘅下一個會議咧，就係喺二月廿八號。

11
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,860
咁嗰個咧，就個討論項目咧。

12
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:51,230
就誒，我哋有立法會文件C B一六三七，就待以視看嗰個表咧。跟住就有C B一六三七個跟進行動嘅表嘅。

13
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,850
噉啊！下次例會咧，就我哋而家。

14
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:07,150
誒準備咧，就提議啊！嚇，就討論下一三年咧十月十六號將軍澳線服務中斷嗰個事故。

15
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:18,990
因為佢報告書出咗嚟啦，咁上次我哋誒見佢哋嘅時候咧，其實好多嘢都好初步，我哋提出啲意見，佢又話佢會考慮噉，但係就冇認真複習會點。

16
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,860
咁所以二月廿八號咧，佢應該就會嚟到一次過覆曬我哋上次問嘅嘢。

17
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,230
噉啊，跟住舒緩港鐵列車車廂擠迫嘅情況。

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,220
呢個咧就可以睇呢個代爾士項嘅表嘅第八項。

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,100
啊，噉就想問下委員係咪同意下次傾呢兩樣嘢？係黃國興議員，主席。

20
00:02:42,380 --> 00:03:02,390
誒，我希望主席能夠同意咧，就我畀信你咧，就係誒頭先你都講咗啦，就係嗰個輕鐵嗰個意外咧，你就話即係等鐵路當局個報告。其實可否安排埋喺月二十八號一拼傾埋佢，擺多個議程？因為如果唔係咧，輕鐵嗰個誒。

21
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:22,400
車頂爆炸，誒產生嚴重事故，就唔知又拖幾耐，拖到凍曬都未傾。咁一次過不如喺二月二十八號一齊傾埋。由現在到到二月二十八號，差唔多有成兩個月時間畀佢準備啦。意外發生，若到到二月二十八號，都有成係三個月啦。嚇，係咪可以安排？

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,820
埋個字傾埋，主席。

23
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:45,160
我都覺得呢個係即係誒有佢嘅價值，因為我哋淨係傾相關路線，其實輕鐵同樣有類似嘅問題，咁應該一次過咧都要交代埋輕鐵。咁月廿包都一個適當嘅時刻，我哋去誒同啊當局同埋啊港鐵嗰邊講呢件事啊。多謝主席啊。咁如果係噉話咧，我哋三。

24
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,970
三個咧就差唔多啦，好嘛，大家。

25
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:54,840
咁主要其實下次個重頭戲都係事故發生嘅原因啦，兩單事故啦。

26
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,690
同埋佢將來嗰個應對啦嚇。

27
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,500
噉就跟住咧就係鐵路項目嘅施工安全。

28
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:13,330
咁咧就立法會文件C.B.一六三七同埋誒係啦零三零四咁啦，噉啊港鐵同埋立法會秘書處都有啲文件提交出嚟嘅。

29
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,370
噉我哋而家歡迎政府當局同埋港鐵公司嘅代表出席呢個會議嚇。

30
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,000
嗯。

31
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,290
今日政府嗰邊有啊，邱成武副局長啦、潘婷婷副秘書長啦，同埋鄭念泰助理。

32
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,450
首席助理秘書長。

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,620
港鐵方面就有李華夫先生、蘇文傑女士、戚偉強先生、陳彩雲先生同埋譚。

34
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,530
漢才先生嘅。

35
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,370
其實都唔係啊，後邊啊，陳生同埋啊譚生係啊勞政署嗰邊啊，嗰陣時係歡迎大家，歡迎大家。

36
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,360
誒。

37
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,200
好啦，或者我而家將個時間交畀啊，報章。好。

38
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,300
多謝主席。

39
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:19,660
啊！今日我哋會向委員會係彙報喺新嘅鐵路項目推展嘅時候，係特別喺建造上所實施嘅安全管理取向同埋措施㗎。

40
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:40,080
現時香港多項嘅大型基建工程係陸續咁展開，五個新鐵路嘅項目嘅建造咧係全速噉樣推展，而建造業現時亦都係持續噉樣去蓬勃咁發展，投新建造業嘅人手不斷咁增加。現時五個鐵路項目嘅地盤咧係超過一百八十個。

41
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,070
僱用嘅工人亦都超過一萬二千七百人。

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:06:04,810
政府當局同埋業界一直都積極喺建造業嗰度推廣安全意識。與此同時，隨住科技同埋建造技術嘅轉變，以及管理同經驗嘅成熟，工人喺進入地盤工作之前咧，係需要接受訓練，而佢哋嘅職安意識亦都係日漸咁提高。

43
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:15,250
喺任何基建同埋大型工程推展嘅期間，安全係政府當局、港鐵公司同埋承建商嘅首要責任。

44
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,540
我哋稍後亦都會係誒交畀港鐵嘅同事解釋一下，喺建造鐵路嘅時候佢哋嘅安全管理同埋措施。

45
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:40,950
雖然港鐵係非常之重視鐵路項目嘅施工安全，但係一宗嘅意外我哋都唔想有，所以我亦都不時噉樣樣去提醒港鐵同埋承建商要共同咁負起建造安全嘅責任。

46
00:06:41,240 --> 00:07:01,250
我哋期望其實我哋嘅交通運輸同埋建造行業嘅朋友，每一日都可以高高興興噉樣上班去，平平安安噉樣樣去翻回家。以下我交畀嘅時間係畀港鐵公司嘅同事同我哋介紹一下佢哋喺建造方面嘅一啲嘅安全嘅啊誒取向同埋佢哋嘅。

47
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,380
措施係點做？

48
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,700
係。

49
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,900
誒，港鐵邊位同事，Mr. Howard？

50
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,950
好，主席。

51
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,610
Thank you, Chairman and Members.

52
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,500
The corporation has strong leadership and safety culture with a very clear safety message.

53
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:30,900
The commitment to protect customers, public contracts and staff, and our safety-first culture and the responsibilities of each director, manager and supervisor are clearly stated in our corporate policy.

54
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:41,380
Over the years, we have clearly communicated our requirements and safety-first cultures to contractors during project delivery through various channels.

55
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,020
我們有引入一係數個措施，喺近年嚟，自Westrail，我哋會喺後面講得更加詳細。

56
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:56,210
我們僱傭和工作密切與 competent and experienced contractors to implement NTI's safety-first culture.

57
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,690
We have a dedicated site team to work with the contractors to ensure that all statutory requirements are met throughout their work.

58
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,970
Together, we are working hard to implement international safety standards and best practices on our sites.

59
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,310
We improve welfare conditions and achieve continuous improvement.

60
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:25,480
The construction of five railway lines concurrently across densely populated districts across the whole of Hong Kong presents enormous challenges.

61
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:33,330
many of our 180 sites are close to flats, occupied buildings or in very busy roads and streets.

62
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:43,560
MTR has worked very close with designers, consultants and contractors to develop safe construction methods with minimal disturbance to the public.

63
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,350
Unlike high-rise construction or construction on greenfield sites, we have limited space to build our railway projects.

64
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:02,650
many of the sites are close to existing buildings, which required the project team to exercise prudent work planning to minimise impact on residents and public nearby.

65
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:11,450
隧道Construction presents a unique challenge by virtue of the confined nature and geotechnical uncertainties.

66
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:29,280
Contractors are required to execute the work in strict compliance with legal requirements, as well as the requirements stated in the International Code of Practice and Tunneling Safety BS6164 for ventilation, lighting, access control, fire protection and so on.

67
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:38,110
Our frontline staff conduct joint inspections in the tunnels to ensure that high standards of safety and health are being maintained at all times.

68
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:50,300
Contractors are provided air-conditioned rest and eating areas, wash basins, toilets and drinking fountains, and these are in addition to required by BS 6164.

69
00:09:50,920 --> 00:10:00,220
我們正在努力確保一個清潔、良好管理和安全的工作環境，以改善業界形象和吸引新工人。

70
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:13,840
adequate welfare facilities are a basic requirement to the well-being of our workers and help to address the needs of workers working under the challenging, very hot and humid conditions of Hong Kong.

71
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:25,870
The contractors provide toilet and shower blocks, washing machines and dryers, and clean changing areas, clinics and canteens on their sites for the comfort of their workers.

72
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:36,790
The rapid increase of construction workers created a surge in demand for all levels of the industry, especially supervisors and construction workers.

73
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,840
The safety culture, risk awareness and skill levels are sometimes less than that of experienced construction workers.

74
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,220
The contractors' accident records show that newcomers are more likely to be injured from accidents on site.

75
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:03,070
to address this, a new worker caring programme was introduced to mentor and assist workers with the working conditions and the site safety requirements and standards.

76
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:10,650
在2010，71%的所有事故涉及工人，誰被在業

77
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:21,690
After implementing the new worker caring programme, this figure dropped to 34% in 2013, and this was despite an increase in new workers to our sites.

78
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,420
Construction workers sometimes have difficulty securing their own insurance cover.

79
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:41,510
MTR是第一個主要僱主，提供免費壽險計劃，以惠顧工人的家庭，在不幸死亡或因自然原因死亡時。

80
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:53,030
This scheme is in addition to the employees' compensation insurance, has been very well received by workers, the industry, unions and the Association of Workers' Rights.

81
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,210
經驗監督員也係供不應求，而且有短缺，來監督工作。

82
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:14,540
為滿足這需求，我們已發展一個助理工作監督員訓練計劃，以訓練新監督員，利用現有的高級監督員作為導師，傳授他們的知識和經驗。

83
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:33,130
The safety awareness and knowledge of workers is a challenge that is being addressed by additional courses in the construction in the contractors' training centres, induction courses, specialist safety courses, toolbox talks, front line briefings, worker interviews and continual engagement.

84
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:42,680
該合作夥伴定期邀請工會和事故受害者家庭提供談話和講座。

85
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:54,550
One of the number of initiatives we have taken over the years is the requirement for all levels of staff and contractor management to attend safety management training according to their position.

86
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:04,600
我們必須確保新措施定期發展和實施，以保持安全訊息的最新和在員工和工人的腦海中。

87
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:11,880
Over the years, we have introduced a number of safety initiatives aimed at worker engagement and workers' health.

88
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:23,420
我們已引入近失報告行動，這係任何在場人士見到危險，可向監督員或安全人員報告。

89
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:31,160
我們一直促進匿名報告，作為一個方式，來涉及工人在改善工地條件和實踐。

90
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:40,720
High potential near misses are shared between the contractors, so we can stop a similar accident or incident occurring on other projects.

91
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:51,670
Safety starts with me is a campaign to remind all staff and workers that they have a responsibility to ensure their own safety and those around them.

92
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,620
Their action can and do make a difference, and this campaign has been effective in raising safety awareness.

93
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:14,340
Accident analysis shows that one of the underlying causes of accidents is how workers are briefed, trained and what equipment they use. We launched the iSafe campaign to get the workers to conduct a personal risk assessment.

94
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,970
to make sure they are well prepared before they start work.

95
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:30,270
The don't walk by campaign was very effective in involving everyone on site as safety ambassadors, and it has resulted in greater ownership and improved site conditions.

96
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:41,470
Instead of leaving an unsafe condition such a trip hazard or loose handrail, everyone on site was encouraged to take action and rectify the condition immediately.

97
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,630
instead of leaving it to cause an accident later.

98
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,720
在 addition to establishing clinics and registered nurses on site, we held a workers' health and well-being month in May 2013.

99
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:09,380
Our major incident command vehicles used to tour the sites to provide free medical checks and health talks by nurses and occupational health specialists to 2,351 workers.

100
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:21,050
血壓、糖尿病、膽固醇、BMI、聽診和眼鏡，都進行了，結果給到工人做跟進，如果有視力問題，如果需要。

101
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:30,260
研究者從香港大學也利用這個機會進行一個調查，關於風險認知和安全文化。

102
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:46,950
一great deal of effort has been put into engaging with the worker, senior managers taking to workers on site and holding lunchtime gatherings to listen to what their thoughts are and how we can improve safety and working conditions on our sites.

103
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:55,060
The you say we act campaign shows the workers that we are listening to what they say and shows what we have done to improve.

104
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,350
This has brought a host of good ideas from the person actually doing the work, and fosters trust.

105
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,870
The think before you act display is a way of attracting attention to safety alerts and near misses on our sites.

106
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:21,390
2012，我們是第一個僱主引入熱症預防指引，which 引入額外15分鐘休息時間在早上和下午在夏季月份。

107
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:32,430
dehydration can be an issue, and in 2013 we were the first employer to provide free rehydration drinks to workers, also during the summer months.

108
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:44,030
We continue to improve site welfare conditions by placing shelters and rest areas equipped with seats, tables, bottled water and cooling fans throughout our sites.

109
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:58,770
finger injuries are the most common injuries on our site, and movement of load was the biggest cause. We introduced a new tool from overseas to keep riggers' hands away from the suspended load during hoisting or lowering.

110
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:16,460
Our railway projects involve 91 civil and 112 Ename contractors. The challenge for us is to ensure that safety standards across these these different sites, different contractors and different projects meet our high safety standards.

111
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:30,240
to this end, the common safety goal is that contractors are required to produce comprehensive and detailed method statements and risk assessments for all medium and high risk work activities to plan and manage manage their work.

112
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:41,150
Our site engineers inspectors review the method statements and inspect the works to ensure full compliance with all statutory requirements and the agreed method of work.

113
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,020
lessons learned from accidents and incidents are shared among staff and contractors.

114
00:17:47,200 --> 00:18:03,730
although we work very closely with the contractor to maintain safe systems of work and a safe working environment, all MTR site staff have been empowered to take immediate action against any contractor that fails to meet safety standards.

115
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:14,610
這些包括 suspend any activity such as those shown in the slide that present an imminent risk to workers themselves or others nearby.

116
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:26,040
verbal improvement notices are first given to the contractor for safety infringements, and written notices and suspension of works will follow if there's no immediate improvement.

117
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:40,930
為確保我們的承包商有安全管理系統，符合立法及國際標準和最佳實踐，我們引入了Det Nors Veritas獨立審計方案。

118
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,880
The audit has 20 elements. It's conducted every six months and looks closely at the safety management system and the site conditions of the contractor.

119
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,910
This audit uses the same protocol used by other major organisations around the world, such as Chevron, Texaco, BP etc.

120
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:06,070
results are linked to milestone payments and should contractors fail an audit, payment is withheld until they pass.

121
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:16,710
Recognition and peer pressure is an effective method of driving continuing improvement and promoting outstanding safety leadership qualities amongst the contractors.

122
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:28,230
The biannual safety, quality, safety, environmental and stakeholders awards is one of the ways that our contractors' performance is recognised and shared between the five projects.

123
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:36,680
insurer,s auditors, stakeholders, senior government officials and construction industry leaders are invited to present the awards.

124
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,680
Our safety management system has been accredited and audited against international standards and has been recognised for safety awards.

125
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:56,060
Our journey of continual improvement began with Wesrail, and in 2000 we achieved a rate of 30.7 accidents per thousand workers.

126
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:10,150
2013年1月至11月，figure for the five new railway projects stands at 14.06， as compared to the figure of 44.3 for the construction industry for 2012.

127
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:17,850
Despite our best efforts, sadly there have been four fatal cases for the commencement works in two thousand nine.

128
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:27,090
每宗fatal accident was investigated by an investigation panel, and improvement measures implemented immediately across the five projects.

129
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,750
Our aim has always been to construct safely with the best planning and supervision possible.

130
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,480
所以，我們都可去家鄉，到我們家庭，一塊，平安健康。

131
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:46,200
The challenge is to raise the safety standards for all employers and contractors on all projects and all sites in Hong Kong.

132
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:55,780
所以， no matter where we a supervisor or worker is working, the safety standards and requirements are the highest possible, and expect them wherever they work.

133
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,470
Thank you, Chairman, Members.

134
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,100
Thank you, Mr. Starwood.

135
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:20,510
而家請啊委員提問啦！我哋有啊三啊分鐘，咁有四位委員，每人五分鐘啦，好嘛？連問連答。噉我提議咧，可能你哋就三分鐘到停一停，等佢哋答咗先，可能你會跟進嘅。第一位係黃國興議員。誒，多謝主席。主席，誒，剛才嘅介紹咧，我哋睇。

136
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:40,520
到誒港鐵係喺呢啲工程項目個安全措施咧，係做咗好多嘢，呢個係值得讚賞嘅。我亦都希望咧，就其他呢個建築地盤咧，都應當係係係誒學習你哋呢啲好嘅經驗。不過，我認為咧，仍然有好大嘅改善空間。

137
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,710
因此咧，我有幾個問題要問嘅。第一個問題咧，就喺誒。

138
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,700
零九年到到一三年咧，有發生四宗嘅致命工業意外。

139
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,450
特別一三年咧，有兩宗係死亡。

140
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:15,740
我想問當局，你個文件咧就冇交代嗰個啊死亡嘅原因同埋對應嘅嘅方法。咁因此咧，我就覺得你似乎咧有避重就輕。咁呢度你係咪可以交代下你呢啲致命嘅工業意外嘅原因？

141
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,890
同埋點樣防止呢個第一個問題？

142
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,830
第二個問題咧，就係誒。

143
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:41,920
喺業界咧就講而家咧嗰啲挖泥機，嗰啲挖泥機咧就係三百六十度咧係可以旋轉嘅。嗰個駕駛室嗰個誒司機咧，佢係冇後眼睇唔到後面，往往咧個駕駛室咧轉彎嘅時候咧，佢個尾部咧就會。

144
00:22:41,920 --> 00:23:01,930
係傷及後面誒嘅工人。咁呢一點而家咧就係其實有好多先進科技咧都可以幫個駕駛室嘅司機咧有個後眼誒，有一啲咧係電子設施。噉你哋會唔會盡快立即考慮採用喺呢啲噉樣嘅畫？

145
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:21,940
豆嗰度咧嘅後面咧安裝呢啲電子警報設施，以避免誒撞到人。呢個第二個問題，第三個問題咧就上一次我哋誒去呢個葵涌嗰個係隧道工程參觀，但係參觀完不久咧就嗰度就發生咧。

146
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,870
就係呢個工業行動，就抗議你哋咧，係有管理階層咧，就係。

147
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:49,770
削減佢哋嗰個休息時間，因為佢哋要嚟到地面休息咧，要減壓嘅啊，然後先可以去到地面休息。但係管理階層咧就係啊單方面嚟去更改削減佢哋一啲嘅作息安排，令到佢哋咧就要進行工業行動。

148
00:23:49,770 --> 00:24:09,780
咁呢個事件咧係直接同佢哋安全有關。噉你哋又冇交代三個問題，請你哋而家今日交代下啦。誒，黃議員，時間控制得好好。誒，局長係你回應先。係主席誒，我想首先回應咗阿阿黃議員嘅第一個問題，然後再請港鐵誒去交代翻嗰三個問題嘅詳情。

149
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:30,190
誒，其實對於嗰四宗嘅意外，我哋都好重視嘅，所以咧，我哋都要求港鐵咧，其實誒同埋責成佢哋嘅承建商咧，喺呢個誒意外裏邊咧，都要係馬上咧係去誒揾出嗰個原因，同埋喺嗰個事件裏邊咧，佢哋吸收到乜嘢嘅經驗，日後可以作出乜嘢嘅防止，或者喺呢度咧，為咗讓。

150
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:41,470
議員能夠詳細少少誒講㗎啦，我請港鐵嘅同事咧係就呢四個事件裏邊咧都可以詳細少少交代，咁然後再回答咧啊議員跟住嗰兩個問題，好嘛？好啊。

151
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,230
港鐵代表。

152
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,600
四個致命嘅意外。

153
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,130
個背景係點？

154
00:24:48,750 --> 00:25:00,970
Safety is paramount importance to the corporation. We have stringent guidelines in supervising contracts and frontline workers of the new rail projects to comply with any statutory requirements.

155
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:21,590
先生，我哋時間係running out，我哋需要知道每一個死亡事故嘅細節。主席，四個致命嘅案例，第一個案例係個鏈子斷咗，當個管道被提起，大概一米，佢跌喺工人嘅腳。

156
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,080
係。

157
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:32,690
Following this, we implemented the push stick and don't walk back and the hands off type of campaign to stop this. And the lessons learned were shared between all the contracts.

158
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:43,710
第二，The worker was in the tunnel and he was walking past the tunnel wall on his way to a break, and a piece of rock fell on his neck and shoulder.

159
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:59,330
total accident. In then in the third case, a worker died when he slipped between the top handrail and the bottom toe board. There was a section of handrail missing, about one metre wide.

160
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:09,150
Following this accident, we retrained all supervisors in the scaffold requirements and stepped up the inspection regime.

161
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,210
Okay, then the other two questions.

162
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,550
about the turnaround of the the equipment machine.

163
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,870
The backhoe machine， we we。

164
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:40,640
Please continue. Sorry, we have a system in place in our general specifications which require that barriers are placed around the backhoe, every backhoe, with a banksman. We're also looking at the moment to look at electronic devices to to test the infrared, the body heat from the people.

165
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:59,720
Which cuts off the back hole? That's been trialled. Mr. Won specifically suggested adding a device in the back of the equipment. That's correct. You plan to do that or not? We're looking at the moment. We've already got infrared cameras to show the operator. We're looking at the moment. Okay, and the third question.

166
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:20,130
about protests, cutting down resting time. Following this this demonstration by the workers, the Labour Department inspected the site and found the working conditions were the the air quality was up to the legal requirements. The MTR and the contractors put a lot of effort into the rest areas.

167
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,310
和條件 of the the working tunnels. So you deny that they cut short the resting time? Is that it?

168
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:34,160
我唔係aware of any any cutting down of any time at all。好，thank you。下一位胡志偉議員。

169
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:54,940
多謝主席。其實我都係想跟進翻啲工作時，因為睇翻嗰個報告咧，其實就誒安全嘅安排咧，似乎係相當之完整嘅。咁但係即係我哋都想知道，因為其實而家成個係鐵路建造嘅工作咧，都相當之趕急㗎。我想了解下就話誒有啲工作時數，其實安排點？

170
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:14,070
噉樣樣有冇誒超時嘅情況？同埋就係誒有冇任何工程咧，已經係因為要趕工嘅關係咧，係即係要係誒要加緊嗰個嘅係誒工作。咁另一個想問下咧，就係喺文件度咧有提到你哋有啲嘅係誒叫做少。

171
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:34,420
險失事故嘅係報告嘅，噉我見到咧就喺誒呢幾年裏邊咧個險失事故嘅報告咧，都係數字都向上升嘅。噉我想你睇睇就係話剔除咗嗰啲因為你工程開展多咗之後，可能增加咗險失事故報告之下，其實成個係趨勢點樣樣咧？第一樣嘢，第二個。

172
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,960
就話。

173
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:48,440
睇呢個險失事故嘅報告之下，有啲乜嘢嘅係改善嘅措施咧，或者係過喺呢度從中得到啲咩經驗咧？可以同我哋分享一下。噉就誒，我主要有兩個問題，多謝主席。

174
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,660
好，港鐵代表。

175
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,200
第一就係個工作時數啊、超時情況啦、誒超時情況趕工啊嗰方面啦嚇。

176
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:20,920
The worker's overtime is governed above ground by the noise permits, so they work a normal 10 hours a day, six days a week, 60 hours. And underground is covered by the drill and blast pattern. They have a 12-hour drill and blast pattern, and they they charge the explosives and the muck.

177
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,480
And all of the rest of the sort of things, workers are not working underground. So the standard 60 hours a week.

178
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,980
我 understanding is six hours week. There's no overtime.

179
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:45,040
或者， extensive overtime involved. They're given by the noise permit, and so they can't work extra hours apart from what they're doing in the moment. 哎，主席，問者澄清翻就係即係話佢所有工作咧係唔會有一個廿四小時嘅安排㗎。

180
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,350
有冇 anything with 24 hour round the clock or the? You know 60 hours a week, but the point is.

181
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,040
Is there a maximum?

182
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,560
duration in which they have to stop.

183
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,190
佢哋。

184
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:09,610
在隧道、 underground， 佢 work 24 hours， 但係佢哋係由一個班次 pattern， 作為在爆破 pattern， 佢哋做兩次爆破一日。

185
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:29,900
And so therefore they have to muck out, charge, and go into. And the maximum number of hours per day for any worker is how long? My understanding is 60 hours per day. Per sorry, 10. Sorry, chairman. Yes, 60 hours per week. The question is how many hours per shift? 10 hours. 10. 10個鐘。OK，唔該曬。

186
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,400
Next question，誒險失事故唔知英文係咩啊？

187
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:50,980
near miss reporting. Okay, near miss. A lot of efforts have been put into this near miss campaign and to to raise awareness and trust of the workers. The trend is going up because the trust has been brought with the workers and has been.

188
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:59,310
more the results are we we use performance and rewards to the workers for

189
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,840
for shown as the near misses.

190
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:11,550
All near misses are shared between all contractors, so the lessons learnt from from the near misses are shared between everybody, so we can all learn together.

191
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,410
所以你係講啲數字係上升，因為你哋做咗一個好嘅工作。

192
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:23,770
Alerting everybody. Is that what you're saying? We're doing a very good job at worker engagement, and that's been our focus over the years.

193
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:44,690
唔，我想請教下，就即係喺呢個near miss嘅report裏邊咧，有啲乜嘢嘅係即係誒，即係點講咧？係實際啲嘅係implementation，即係啲乜嘢實際嘅工作咧，係即係能夠從中咧係得到改善嗰個嘅工地嘅環境，令到嗰個即係near miss當然係未未發生啦。咁但係就。

194
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,480
因為噉樣樣時間咧，係改善咗，係防止咗一啲事故嘅發生。

195
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:56,470
有冇啲具體嘅係即係嘅建議喺度？

196
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:13,000
If you look at the the push stick that I showed on the slide, that's a result of the near miss of the worker, the load coming down, and a fatal case. That is a near miss where the the riggers pushed the load as opposed to put the hands on the load.

197
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,570
and this is a result of one of the near misses that we've been having—fingers, toes and back injuries.

198
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:39,060
Others near misses are. I guess the question is, do most of these near miss reported resulted in your changing or revising your policies and procedures? Yes, they do. If you would we investigate every near miss, every accident, every incident, and if you the safety alerts is shown the slide there.

199
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:46,060
係，係一個結果，係一個誤差，係。

200
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,590
誒，多謝主席。

201
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:55,790
就我都留意到咧，係去年發生嘅喺隧道工作嘅員工嘅一啲工業行動。

202
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:16,080
噉啊，除咗頭先提到嘅佢哋嘅一啲嘅投訴之外咧，就其實仲提到話空氣質素嘅問題嘅。咁當然啦，誒，根據我哋立法會議員嚇去參觀嘅，包括係高鐵嘅地盤，包括喺葵涌嘅隧道工程裏邊咧，我都覺得各方面。

203
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:36,090
嘅工地嘅管理與安排都係比過往係有好大進步嘅。咁但係畢竟特別係隧道工作咧，空氣質素咧都始終係一個關注嘅問題。噉我想特別係想問咧，就係話喺舊年呢個工業棚洞之後啊，雖然當時都好快處理咗，咁但係喺誒安排上咧有。

204
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:56,100
邊啲地方係能夠進一步令到啲員工係誒適宜嘅，或者係覺得係較為工作得安心嘅。咁第二樣咧，我就留意到喺頭先介紹裏邊咧係建造工人嘅人壽保障計劃。嗱，呢個就真係相當好啦。如果誒鐵路港鐵公司係本港啊首創為建造工人提供呢個免費人壽保障計劃啦。

205
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,790
呢個係好好可取嘅。咁當然啦，因為誒。

206
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:21,080
呢幾個工程項目牽涉到嘅建造工人咧，有好多分判啊。噉係咪而家即係各級嘅分判嘅工人咧，都能夠已經得到呢個百分之百啊，能夠得到呢個人壽保障計劃？誒，另外咧誒，員工裏邊咧亦都有啲咧並非本地工人嘅啊。咁即係呢方面安排又係點樣？

207
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,740
是否有即係同樣嘅對待咧？噉啊，多謝主席，足夠時間畀你回答應該。

208
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,140
係。

209
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,370
港鐵代表。

210
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:46,820
The tunnel air quality. Following that incident, the Labour Department tested the quality of the air and found it to be okay and satisfactory. But we still continue to. We put extra fans in, and we've done this across all our projects.

211
00:34:47,120 --> 00:35:07,130
and also use tons of ice in the tunnels to blow across the ice to cool the temperature down. It's very hot in the tunnels. Sorry, who tested the the air quality and found it acceptable? The Labour Department. We also government. Okay. Yes. Also, we ourselves we are covered by the

212
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:19,170
Confined space regulations. So after each blast and then before each shift, we do air quality testing for all of the major gases, and before anybody can go down, it is tested and certified okay.

213
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,400
所以呢啲係一啲措施，都係我哋 put across all our all our tunnels。

214
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,810
with regards to the insurance programme.

215
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:45,560
Just a second，阿盧議員，除咗誒空氣質素，你係咪仲有其他方面？誒，第二個問題就關即係你第一個問題嗰度。第一個問題主要關心就係空氣質素同埋嘅時候嘅跟進嚇，即係工業意外誒工業行動之後嘅一啲改善。噉就先都答咗㗎啦嚇，啊，跟住第二個就係關於人壽保障嘅問題嚇。

216
00:35:47,750 --> 00:36:07,760
Yes, is any person, any worker, and any security guard, any armour who enters our sites and works on our sites, whether it be subcontractors, main contractors or whatever, who have worked on our sites within nine days in the previous thirty days, is covered for workers.

217
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:26,290
Insurance. You are non-local workers. Local any any person as long as they have entered and have done the training, and they can prove that they've been working on sites are covered. And this is a 24-hour health cover, so they can die natural causes, and they're covered.

218
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,880
七天一週，24小時。

219
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:43,280
即係呢個保險就係誒不問嗰個誒即係或者係啊誒身故原因嚇，即使係因病並非因為工作係都受到保障嘅係咪？

220
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,980
O.K.噉啊，主席覺得呢個都係一個即係相當好嘅計劃。

221
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,470
what would the payouts?

222
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:11,620
the they they're classed as industrial accidents and are covered by the normal employees compensation, but additions. Not that the insurance you bought for those to cover those four fatal accidents. Yes, what would the eventual payout to the family? The insurance scheme that we this is two hundred thousand dollars.

223
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:31,910
which are given to the but the overall each of the four fatal families, accident families, received two hundred thousand for this scheme for the employees. Yes, for the employees' compensation, it's up to the courts and up to the the other the insurers to.主席係，我想跟進問嘅就係話誒，如果係並非因工作。

224
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:41,190
引致嘅誒身故嚇，譬如疾病引致嘅，即係呢啲嗰個保險額係幾多？可以得到幾多保障？個數額係幾多？

225
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:54,130
誒，the amount of the coverage for non-accident related，兩百萬都係，所以就係，regarding the cost，regardless of the cost。

226
00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:02,790
sorry chairman，regardless of the cause of the，regardless of if he dies，as I say after nine days，it's a fact.

227
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,040
好。

228
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,830
下一個問題啊，到我想問一問咧，就誒。

229
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:19,430
睇翻誒一路以嚟呢幾年嗰啲誒人數傷亡人數咧，最高就係考第一個高鐵。

230
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,880
啊！高鐵香港段今日跟住又西港島線嘅一百四廿七九廿六。

231
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:40,140
噉啊，跟住咧就其他就跌得好低咧。咁首先就係呢兩條線西港島線點解都係一個咁高嘅比率啊？即係即係數字咧。第二咧就係喺高鐵嗰度咧。

232
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:49,140
我睇到咧，係由二零一零年到二零一三年嘅五月咧，總共係一百四廿七宗傷亡。

233
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,960
但係，二零一三年五月到二零一三年十一月七個月之內咧。

234
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,120
佢多咗係一百宗傷亡。

235
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,570
即係話頭三年，高鐵係一百四廿七。

236
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,680
最後七個月係一百。

237
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,930
咁頭三年嗰一百四廿七咧，係得一個死亡。

238
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,970
最近呢七個月咧，個一百咧，仲有兩個死亡添。

239
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,420
如果我瞭解你哋嘅數字。

240
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,150
咁呢個好有問題啦！高鐵點解急劇上升咧？

241
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,700
嘅傷亡，甚至乎死亡率。

242
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,480
係點咧？係趕工。

243
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,130
唔夠人，未有足夠培訓就去，係咩原因咧？唔該，你解釋下。

244
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:58,950
The two deaths, as we spoke about, one was the crushed by the backhoe when the supervisor walked between the backhoe and the tunnel wall, and the other was the fall from between the scaffolding. And they have nothing to do with the the accidents themselves. The majority of those accidents have all been fingers.

245
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:09,090
我

246
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:18,330
That they had 146 accidents in the first three years, and then an additional 100 accidents in the last seven months. What's happening?

247
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:38,620
The nature of work has changed, the the way that the drilling, blasting and the more the length of the tunnels have increased, the lining is going in, the movement of rebar etc. The states, the change of work procedures and practices are in there, and as I say, the fingers, toes, back sprains, are all part of.

248
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,270
這 nature of injuries.

249
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:50,180
This is quite bizarre. You mean to tell me, in the building of each rail, at different stages, we are expected to see different accident rates?

250
00:40:51,130 --> 00:41:11,140
different types of accidents. When you start with the foundations and a greenfield site and you piling, then that's a different status. You go then go through into different moving of the of the rebar and scaffolding and fingers and moving of loads. Then you start to work into the scaffolding and working height. There are different stages of the projects and.

251
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,680
You go through. At the moment, we're all into manual handling of the loads.

252
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:25,330
and so on, and we've worked very hard on this movement to push this. So it is expected that any railway project. I didn't even realise this when I was.

253
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:30,050
在同啲同類型嘅公司，喺同一個行業，喺同一個業務，喺同一個領域，喺同一個

254
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:37,200
Is that what you're telling us? At different stages of the project, something little change, nature change.

255
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:52,480
但 for the high speed rail, this is escalating tremendously. But it is in line with the other projects as well. XRL is is so. Do we expect West Island Line, South Island Line also the the numbers to go up towards completion?

256
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:09,320
The Western Line, all of the projects are different stages of their completion, and so the numbers would all go up towards the last couple of months. We're working very hard to make sure that doesn't happen. So we put in a lot of effort into educating. That's why I don't understand.

257
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:17,230
Should an accident rate be con-controlled, regardless of the different stages, you just take more precautionary measure.

258
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,400
That's what I don't understand.

259
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:40,480
主席或者啊，我我請港鐵或者解釋啊多清楚少少咧，因為啊，高鐵第一佢嗰個長度啊，即係個長度同譬如同西港島線比，或者同啊其他較為短嘅嘅鐵路比咧，其實其實佢係長好多，同埋佢而家目前咧用嘅人人數亦都多好多。如果我哋想掌握佢哋本身嗰個。

260
00:42:40,480 --> 00:43:00,490
意外率嚟講咧，啊，高鐵而家佢個意外率一千人度咧，即係一千嘅嘅工人裏邊咧，其實意外率係十一點八。我想我明，我而家唔係將高鐵嘅誒意外率同其他比，我係同一條線點解突然之間起得咁犀利？咁廣鐵代表咧就話唔同階段呢個係正常。

261
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:18,330
噉我唔明啦。噉你唔同階段嘅時候，噉你咪再小心啲咯。你咪再加強你個安全措施得。點可以接受啊？壞頭三年一百四廿幾，最後七個月一百係正常嘅，係應該嘅咧。係嘛？呢個真係要講講。啊，係啊，阿Maggie。

262
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:38,620
許我補充少少，誒頭先啊，Steve誒企圖咧就解釋畀大家理解咧，就係而家因為嗰個工程係唔同嘅階段，譬如誒高西鐵誒西港島線同埋高鐵咧，係因為佢進入咗嗰個高峯期，其實喺工地上邊工人嗰個工時數咧係相對嚟講咧喺。

263
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:58,630
過去嗰幾誒大半年或者九個月嘅時候咧，係增加得比較多嘅，因為我哋需要用一啲多點共同去施工嘅工作啦，同埋工人喺工地上邊嗰個嘅工時咧，相對嚟講係多咁喺個誒。如果我哋睇翻誒個案嘅數字咧，可能係會多咗。

264
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:18,640
咁但係嗰個平均個比率嚟睇咧，就係應該係維持翻喺同一個水平。咁但係當然，我哋都仍然係未滿意呢個水平。我哋誒亦都用緊唔同嘅方法，譬如話，因為呢段時間好多人手嘅施工誒，譬如一啲嘅調運啊，或者係用手去推一啲嘅運一啲新嘅機器。

265
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:38,650
氣啊！一啲設備入場啦，噉我亦都用緊一啲唔同嘅方式咧，去減少呢啲意外。嗱，蘇女士，你呢個解釋咧，我就清晰啦，明白啦，即係話個百分比冇喺度，因為你最近七個月你嘅total man hours可能等於過往三年，係係咪？冇錯，唔該，你提交啲數字畀我哋得唔得？過往三年你。

266
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:44,180
個total manpower成幾多？最近七個月個total manpower成幾多？等我哋自己都即係。

267
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:57,870
誒即係復復呢個即係説法啦，好嘛？跟住啊，鄧家彪議員。誒，多謝主席。誒，即係我諗五條鐵路裡面，其實大家都係最關心高鐵嗰個地盤裡面嘅職業安全。

268
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:12,130
因為第一呢個係十分之重點嘅工程，亦都因為要配合全國高鐵嗰個列車嗰個即係啲嘅行車嘅安排咧，所以嗰個工期咧亦都係即係需要盡量達到目標。

269
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:23,130
咁但係咧，即係喺另一個方面嘅關鍵就係，因為佢係一個比較深嘅隧道，隧道我諗頭先同事都講咗嘅幾個方面係比較突出，令人關注，一個係。

270
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:40,630
誒，因為經常有爆破啦，所以空氣裡面有一啲嘅，即係誒，即係好多嘅，即係誒，不單係只塵啊，甚至可能係石粒啊，咁呢啲係即係令人好擔心個肺病嗰個嗰個嗰個問題。第二就係嗰個減壓夠唔夠咧？

271
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:49,420
第三咧就係始終係一個誒相對密閉嘅空間，工友嗰個心理壓力咧，亦都係存在嘅。

272
00:45:49,720 --> 00:46:09,730
咁所以即係我哋即係工會或者勞工界都係覺得係要好小心去處理呢個工地嘅安全。噉我所知道咧，其實誒勞工處同埋即係建造業界以及咧係香港建造業總工會，其實咧就經常咧係會去到各工型同埋。

273
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:29,740
係私營嘅建築項目嗰個工地裏面咧，喺一啲午膳嘅時間裏面咧，會同工友咧係講職安。其實咧一個最重要嘅嘅説誒兩個最重要目的咧，就係第一，即係話令到工友覺得喺佢工作期間見到一啲啊，可以有啲嘢反應啊，可以。

274
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:49,750
有啲申訴嘅渠道，噉佢唔會覺得咧，就係入到工場咧，就即係淨係得發展商佢即係有問題都反映唔到。第二個就係時刻提醒啲工友要注意安全。咁所以咧，我係想問啊，即係呢一方面咧，究竟誒誒，譬如呢一啲噉嘅合作項目，會唔會去到即係高鐵裡面嘅地盤咧，令？

275
00:46:49,750 --> 00:47:09,760
令到我頭先所講咧，尤其入到去隧道工作工，有個心理壓力好大嘅，即係誒係一個好密閉嘅空間。佢覺得即係叫天不應，叫地不聞。係咪喺呢度都可以做多啲嘅安排，令到好多可能工友對管理上面嘅問題一早已經可以透過唔同嘅途徑反映出嚟，將一啲。

276
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:29,770
即係少嘅矛盾，即係可以化解，避免又出現啲工潮嘅問題。因為我所理解嗰個工潮並唔係因為對薪金待遇有問題有不滿，而係一個作息嘅安排，即係以及係午膳嘅安排。咁所以可唔可能係就透過恆常呢啲邀請，可能係啲專業界別啦？

277
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:43,740
或者係工會入去工地，令到喺度工作嘅工友係覺得喂係好多人關心緊佢哋，就唔需要話將啲矛盾積埋啊，或者點樣？因為更重要，其實嗰度真係危機處處嘅。噉啊，希望你睇下可唔可能回應佢。

278
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,280
邊位回應？

279
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,140
講 thiệt啊！

280
00:47:53,020 --> 00:48:13,030
Chairman, we have regular visits by the unions coming to the sites to talk to the workers. They give presentations at our safety conference, and we have visits by the victims' association for for the rights of the families. They all come down to talk to our workers, and this is part of the.

281
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:31,170
You say we act type of initiative, and the engagement for the workers, give them the opportunity to talk to us and any grievances they have, and this has been very, very productive in improving trust, improving the conditions on site.

282
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:51,530
So we do actively discuss things with the unions, and they're very helpful to us. And next year, sorry, this year we're bringing them into even more to help to see where we can improve with them. We continue dialogue with the unions and our workers on very many different levels, from project directors.

283
00:48:51,530 --> 00:49:02,150
all the way down to site inspectors, to ourselves go out, projects director T C Chu goes out, talks to the workers, so on a lot of fronts we're improving in that area.

284
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:17,180
So you're saying you allow different groups to go in and talk to the workers? Yes, we encourage it. In terms of getting direct feedback from the workers to MTR Corporation, because you may not know everything that the contractors are doing.

285
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:37,470
Is there any such scheme in place? We have inspectors on the ground every day, every minute of the day. We have safety staff on the ground who are talking to the contractors continually. They're talking. But do they talk to the workers during lunchtime breaks and all that? Yes, they're there as well. They take the breaks with the workers in the air-conditioning tunnel areas.

286
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:45,620
And the rest areas, they they the same canteens and same areas, and they talk to workers. So your own inspectors do that? Yes.

287
00:49:47,970 --> 00:50:07,980
更加表現好。誒嗱，誒我諗最重要都係提高工人對呢個地盤個歸屬感。即係一次以前我細，好我用多少時間？即係以前我細個睇啲建築業嘅廣告，呢份樓我呢呢層樓我分起嘅。喺度個少少嘅建議就係呢啲工人可唔可能咧？當呢個高鐵通車嗰陣時，免費畀。

288
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,840
佢哋做來回一程嚇，畀佢哋試下自己嘅作品，提高佢哋歸屬感，點解？

289
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,020
呢個意見，你哋考慮下啦。

290
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,900
誒，我哋而家時間啊，謝偉全議員啊。

291
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:25,490
臨尾佢就好啦，我哋今日時間啊，其實原本係啱啱九鐘啊，好謝議員嚟。

292
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:45,790
就我我想問咧，因為其實即係頭先講過大型基建嗰啲項目增加啦，噉啊，即係好多行咧，或者面對人手短缺，噉我提留意到咧，就關於嗰個安全問題咧，佢哋都要有照顧嗰啲新入行嗰啲建造工友。噉啊喺呢方面咧，我想即係誒即係問一問咧，其實佢。

293
00:50:45,790 --> 00:51:05,800
有呢啲誒，佢本身有啲指導員嘅咁有冇即係因為我即係擔心嗰啲誒成員商咧，即係如果係人手唔夠嘅時候太多新入行或者唔熟嗰啲咧，嗰個誒有冇限制個比例嘅？譬如你誒嗰個指導員啊，同嗰啲新入行嗰啲咧，主席唔知有冇一個比例？

294
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:20,500
咧即係話你一個可以帶帶一個，亦或係因為呢個有額外工作咧噉樣。咁呢方面我想即係睇下可唔可以地鐵方面講一講。即係話有個藍色stick同好似係紅色唔知黃色stick啊嘛，有冇個比例喎？

295
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,010
指導員同埋新入行係咪維持一個比例？

296
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,920
It's normally.

297
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:49,600
normally for mentoring it's one to two one mentor to two new workers and they identify the worker by an N which means a new worker to the industry he has a square on his on his helmet to say he's new and therefore everybody around him can see that he's new and he helps him out or a P which means

298
00:51:49,600 --> 00:52:09,610
Provisional, which is not new to the industry, but is new to the the site. So therefore, we have two two levels of of worker, and that's been this N and P has been adopted by other organisations within Hong Kong as the and as is the mentoring system. So they closely monitored.

299
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:22,270
and assisted in every way they can. So this is what we're doing at the moment. So you're saying that at any time at any worksite, you maintain a ratio between the experienced and the new at the ratio of one to two.

300
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,100
We try our best to do that, and it's that's what we're aiming for—one to two.

301
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,110
how how has the result been? I know that's what you're aiming for, but what's the result?

302
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:48,390
The results are that, as far as I'm aware, that that's what we've been achieving. The contractors have not said to us that that has shown any difficulties. And when I would go out and around the sites and, but your inspectors when they go on site have they reported that this ratio?

303
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,300
seems to be in place, or it was not covered.

304
00:52:51,650 --> 00:53:11,660
It seems that I've not heard of any problems in that areas, and when I go on site and visit the sites with the rest, I see the same thing happening. The ends and the peas are there, and the mentors are doing their jobs. And it shows by the reduction in the number of accidents that been having with the mentor with the new joiners that this is effective, and is working.

305
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:29,300
Last time we heard, you still have a huge shortage on the high-speed rail. So by the time you hire them, there may be a lot of new workers. So how do you maintain this ratio when you get the new workers in? Well, the the old workers are getting older and supervisors are getting. I see. So the new one becomes the old one.

306
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,990
In just a matter of few months.

307
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:42,850
另外，我想係咪即係澄清下，即係如果你誒綠色嘅幾時變做即係冇綠色嘅咧？噉啊，幾耐到？How long would a new newly trained become?

308
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,520
change of status，六個月。

309
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,800
六個月，係嘛？

310
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,590
好啦，我哋下一個由而家以前嘅時間啱啱好啦，十一點四十分。

311
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:01,060
噉我哋下一個議程咧，就係就香誒港鐵就呢個鐵路項目進行嘅社區聯絡工作嘅。

312
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:06,000
咁文件咧就係C B一六三七嘅零五零六。

313
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,230
噉啊！而家請政府介紹一下啦。

314
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:32,260
主席，誒各位議員，我哋剛才頭先就就新鐵路嘅設施施工嘅時候所作出嘅安全咧，係同大家交代咗誒一整套嘅一個誒安排同埋措施。咁其實喺興建新鐵路嘅時候咧，我哋除咗係注重建造嘅安全之外咧，我哋需

315
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:52,270
需要顧及好多方面嘅其他因素，例如咧係點樣同居民誒嘅溝通，令到佢哋更加了解誒即將進行嘅工程咧係對佢哋本身嘅影響，亦都吸納佢哋本身喺呢個過程裏邊嘅意見，因為咧佢哋係最終嘅用家嚟嘅，所以喺公

316
00:54:52,270 --> 00:55:06,000
工程期間或者係日後嘅使用方面咧，佢哋可以瞭解更多呢個工程嘅話咧，可以作出相應嘅配合，而足使咧啊，我哋個工程同埋日後嘅運作咧都能夠暢順嘅。

317
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:27,100
所以咧，港鐵公司咧喺建造新鐵路嘅時候咧，都會係投放人手咧，去做好社區聯絡嘅工作。主要就係希望公眾對工程嘅內容啦、進展啦、工程可能對社區嘅影響或者帶嚟嘅好處咧，係更多噉樣瞭解，表達佢哋嘅睇法，亦都產生一個良。

318
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:34,000
性嘅互動咧，使到雙方咧都能夠有啲嘅誒共識啦，或者啲嘅諒解，作出互相嘅配合。

319
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:53,590
啊，就好似而家進行緊嘅西港島線啊，將會喺二零一四年通車啦。咁自從開工以嚟咧，港鐵公司都一直係非常重視地區嘅聯絡工作，亦都做咗大量工作啊，使到喺通過唔同嘅活動啊、渠道噉樣樣，係建立咗社區良好嘅關係㗎。

320
00:55:54,070 --> 00:56:14,080
啊！所以社區亦都好熱切噉樣期待咧，呢條鐵路嘅落成成為一條真正嘅社區鐵路。當然，除咗西港島線之外咧，其他另外嗰四條嘅鐵路，包括南港島線、觀塘線嘅延線、沙中線同埋高鐵咧，亦都好似講到嘅誒西港島線一樣咧，我哋同樣都係用呢一個。

321
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,080
嘅取向同做法嚟講咧，係重視同地區嘅溝通㗎。

322
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:28,240
噉啊，以下嘅時間，我請港鐵公司咧，係講解一下咧，喺佢哋建造呢個新鐵路嘅時候所做嘅有關社區聯絡嘅工作。好啦，港鐵代表。

323
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,570
多謝主席。

324
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:44,620
早晨，主席同埋各位議員。咁剛才副局長咧都已經指出咗咧，社區聯絡工作咧係誒鐵路公司係推進鐵路工程時候嘅重要性。咁而家咧就由我介紹一下咧，港鐵公司喺新鐵路項目嘅社區聯絡工作。

325
00:56:45,950 --> 00:57:05,960
我哋建設鐵路咧係以服務市民為本嘅，咁所以我哋都希望新線嘅設計規劃咧都係可以切合到社區嘅需要，令到鐵路落成之後咧可以成為社區嘅一部分。咁所以公眾嘅參與對於我哋落實新嘅鐵路項目係起咗一個好重要嘅作用㗎。我哋而家喺香港咧總共係起緊五條新嘅鐵路。

326
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:25,970
喺人口密集嘅香港起新嘅鐵路，除咗要有精密嘅設計、周長嘅施工安排同埋嚴謹嘅工程監管之外，由於工地同埋民居咧係十分接近，工程無可避免咧會對佢哋嘅日常生活造成一啲唔方便。咁所以我哋喺推展新鐵路項目嘅時候咧，工程團隊必須同社區保持緊密嘅聯。

327
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:26,550
係。

328
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:47,970
我哋希望做到以下三點：第一就係等社區咧更加了解我哋嘅工程內容、進展同埋工程對社區可能造成嘅影響，咁等到咧社區咧可以對於工程咧有大啲嘅準備。第二，我哋希望咧社區可以誒同我哋咧建立一個互信同埋雙向嘅長遠關係。噉我哋嘅工程團隊咧。

329
00:57:47,970 --> 00:58:07,980
一係會以開放嘅態度，主動同埋社區人士接觸，聽取佢哋嘅意見，咁取得社區嘅信任同埋諒解。第三，我哋透過呢一啲嘅接觸同埋溝通，有助我哋瞭解對地區誒地區對設計同埋建造等等嘅唔同嘅關注同埋意見。噉我哋喺可行嘅情況之下咧，都會盡量融入社。

330
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,900
區嘅建議作出調整同埋優化，令到鐵路個項目可以成為社區嘅一部分。

331
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:34,580
噉我哋喺推展鐵路項目咧，主要係分為三個階段嘅。咁即係設計啦、建造啦，同埋啟用。噉我哋咧喺會，喺分別喺呢三個嘅階段咧，都會利用合適嘅途徑去進行社區嘅聯絡工作。咁首先咧就介紹下設計階段嘅時候，我哋做啲嘅社區工工作。咁喺設計階段咧，我哋會着重。

332
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:54,590
增加社區對新鐵路設計嘅規劃同誒嘅新鐵路嘅設計同埋規劃嘅瞭解。咁因為鐵路規劃同埋設計咧係受到好多唔同嘅因素影響嘅，咁例如係地理環境、人口分佈、附近建築物等等。噉我哋咧係有需要令到社區明白我哋點解會噉樣起鐵路。噉我哋會舉辦啦，同埋出席。

333
00:58:54,590 --> 00:59:14,600
唔同嘅公眾諮詢會同埋居民會議，親身同埋社區分享討論新鐵路嘅設計。咁以沙中線為例咧，我哋同埋相關嘅政府部門咧喺設計階段咧，就已經舉行咗超過一百次嘅諮詢會議㗎啦。咁另外，我哋都會喺合適嘅地方舉行巡迴展覽，同埋印製一啲嘅小冊子啊、單張啊等等。

334
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:24,570
咁另外咧，我哋都為每一個鐵路項目係開始一個專題嘅網站，等全港嘅市民咧都可以利用呢啲唔同嘅途徑，知識鐵路嘅發展方向同埋規劃。

335
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:46,350
咁喺過程之中咧，我哋都收集到唔同嘅市民意見嘅。咁雖然咧，鐵路嘅設計係有限制，未必咧係可以即係真係天馬行空，吸納到所有人嘅意見。但係喺可行嘅情況之下咧，我哋都會盡量參考去優化鐵路嘅設計嘅。咁好似喺西港島線啦，咁誒，我哋喺公眾諮詢期間咧，知道市民都好關注區。

336
00:59:46,350 --> 01:00:06,360
內大家睇到途中咧，就係科士街嘅樹場。咁大家咧都係好關注啲復樹場嘅保育問題。咁經過仔細嘅考慮之後，咁加上咧，我哋喺地區咧揾到一啲合適嘅地方去重置翻個泳池。咁所以咧，我哋就決定咧，就將原本大家係睇到咧係左下邊嗰幅圖咧，就原本位於科士街樹場嘅堅尼地城站咧。

337
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:26,370
我哋就改喺咧，就係誒而家圖中所見堅尼地城泳池位置咧，去興建個車站。咁而而喺我哋拆卸咗舊嘅泳池之後咧，就喺泳誒將泳池就係區內嘅其他地方重置。咁另外沙中線咧，亦都有因應意見減少到一啲臨時嘅支援工地面積，取消咗喺鑽石山興。

338
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:32,810
興建列車停放處，改為利用已經停用咗嘅紅磡貨運站改裝成為列車停放處。

339
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:54,050
喺鐵路嘅時候咧，可能都會有一啲公共嘅設施受到影響嘅。咁除咗重置咧，我哋都會把握機會，適當去改善呢啲重置嘅設施。咁大家圖中見到咧，就係幾項喺鐵路項目咧，誒，我哋所重置嘅設施。咁喺誒左上角嘅咧，就係我哋喺起西港島線嘅時候，我哋就將大輪子康復中心搬。

340
01:00:54,050 --> 01:01:14,060
再去活化之後嘅高街舊半山區警署咁誒頭先頭都有提過啦，就係為咗起堅尼地城泳池咧，我哋就重置咗誒誒。為咗喺呢個堅尼地城站咧，我哋就重置咗新嘅堅尼地城泳池。咁新嘅泳池咧都加入咗一啲新嘅環保措施，而外觀同埋設計方面咧都係完善咗㗎。

341
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:27,680
咁而喺左下角嗰幅圖咧，就係喺我哋沙中線嘅項目之下，喺九龍灣從至嘅中央郵誒中央郵件中心，裡面嘅郵政設施咧，都係配合到日後嘅郵政服務發展，都係惠及到全港嘅市民嘅。

342
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:48,870
咁誒講完設計嘅階段咧，我哋就去到呢個建造嘅階段啦。噉我哋工程嘅同事咧，除咗喺施工嘅設計同埋管理上面，盡力將影響減到最低之外，另外一項工作咧就係要令到社區明白工程計劃嘅內容同埋工程對社區環境可能造成嘅影響，減低社區對工程嘅疑慮。

343
01:01:48,870 --> 01:02:08,880
咁例如公眾人士咧，可能對爆爆破嘅工程咧，可能係有擔心，噉我哋就會帶佢哋去實地參觀，例如去一啲其他嘅鐵路工程嘅工地，去感受一下爆破嘅感覺同埋影響。咁又例如咧，公眾可能會擔心到咧工程對嗰個誒交通嗰個嘅誒交通改道引致嘅一啲擠塞嘅問題啦，噉我哋都會同。

344
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:28,890
佢哋一齊落去現場咧，實地瞭解一齊交流下具體嘅實施同埋運作。咁唔單止咧有助消除佢哋嘅疑慮，噉我哋咧仲可以透過呢啲交流咧，得到好多地區人士咧畀到好多好實用嘅意見，去改進呢啲嘅交通措施。添咁除咗實地瞭解啦，居民咧都可以誒安坐家中收到工程資料㗎。咁正如頭先我都提過啦。

345
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:40,430
噉我哋誒會印製一啲嘅工程嘅通訊啦、單張啦、小冊子啦、通告啦，咁亦都喺誒網誒設立一啲嘅專題網站，咁令到市民可以好方便收到呢啲工程嘅資料。

346
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:59,170
咁居民亦都可以利用我哋港鐵嘅工程熱線二九九三三三三三，同埋我哋工程嘅資訊中心咧去了解工程嘅內容嘅。咁而我哋喺工地嘅圍板上面咧，亦都展示咗誒工地人員嘅聯絡電話。咁居民咧係可以直接同我哋工程人員聯絡反映意見或者係查詢嘅。

347
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:20,470
工程無可避免咧，係會對環境帶嚟一啲影響。噉我哋都好明白，居民係關注呢啲影響嘅。咁所以喺施工之前，我哋會要求承建商切實考慮市民嘅關注，盡量採用產生較少噪音同埋泥塵嘅施工方法。咁好似喺西港島線咧，大家睇到圖誒下面嘅嗰幅圖啦，就係我哋第一次用水。

348
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:40,480
去減低興建樹井時所產生嘅震動、聲浪同埋泥塵。咁市民喺地面上嘅活動咧，都係唔會受到影響㗎。咁除此之外，喺民居附近嘅工地，如果現場嘅環境有足夠嘅空間，我哋都會盡量用密封式嘅隔音罩去減低工程嘅聲浪同埋泥塵㗎。咁大家見到咧上面嘅兩幅圖。

349
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,660
咧就係我哋喺興建何文田站嘅時候咧，所使用嘅隔音罩同埋保護網。

350
01:03:48,110 --> 01:04:08,120
而喺工地附近一帶咧，我哋都會有唔同嘅措施去協助社區㗎。咁包括咧係派駐關懷大師，幫助居民咧去熟習因為工程而需要改道嘅一啲區內交通嘅轉變。另外咧有一啲工地嘅圍板咧，可能係會影響到附近嘅商户㗎。噉我哋就會喺圍板上面設置一啲適當嘅指示牌咧。

351
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:18,940
去指示翻店鋪嘅位置。咁當然啦，工地亦都十分注重清誒整潔㗎。噉我哋都會要求承建商咧去定期整理工地，同埋採取各項保持環境衞生嘅措施。

352
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:40,230
除咗地區嘅聯絡工作，令到整體嘅香港市民瞭解鐵路嘅設計同埋規劃同埋工程咧，係一樣咁重要㗎。噉我哋咧都會透過一啲唔同層面嘅全港性公眾參與活動，等全港市民咧瞭解鐵路。咁例如我哋係舉辦過一啲互動嘅電腦同埋手機遊戲啦，舉辦過全港性嘅比賽啦。

353
01:04:40,230 --> 01:05:00,240
啦，咁例如係隧道鑽挖機嘅命名比賽，等市民可以知多啲關於誒隧道鑽挖機同埋誒建造嘅方法。咁仲有工地圍板設計比賽啦，徵集區內嘅學生幫我哋美化工地同埋社區環境，仲可以咧增加居民對社區嘅歸屬感添。咁另外咧，我哋都同香港資專設計學院。

354
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:08,880
同埋香港高等科技教育學院嘅學生合作創作咗一係列有關鐵路知識嘅卡通漫畫，喺報章刊登連載嘅。

355
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:29,530
另外咧，我哋亦都會去咧誒學校啦，例如中小學同埋幼稚園啦，定期咧去舉辦一啲嘅學校嘅講座。噉我哋嘅公場庭團隊咧，仲會不時同社區嘅團體，好似係老人中心啊、青少年中心或者係少數族裔嘅服務機構等等咧，去舉辦活動，令到公眾咧可以透過參觀同埋遊戲認識。

356
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,880
我哋鐵路嘅工程。

357
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:45,970
而我哋都誒有一啲嘅社區大事係會透過探訪同埋向社區提供協助，同社區建立長期嘅良好夥伴關係，令到居民可以更加容易知道我哋工程嘅進度，提出意見，等我哋可以適時跟進。

358
01:05:47,290 --> 01:06:07,300
此外咧，我哋都會有一啲咧誒誒活動咧，係畀市民。請畀我啲時間，唔係好足㗎，你誒好快好快，市主席畀多幾分鐘好拍。噉我哋就誒會有一啲嘅活動咧，畀市民咧參與我哋嘅鐵路項目。噉啊，例如我哋大家睇到咧，就係我哋西港島線咧係舉辦咗一個社區嘅藝術計劃。噉啊，等西區嘅居民同埋學生同我哋參與創作。

359
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:18,340
噉啊，將來咧就喺嗰個車站嘅設計上面都可以一齊去表現嘅。咁剛才嘅簡報咧，就係希望等各位議員咧可以等誒對我哋嘅社區嘅聯絡工作咧有一個概略嘅認識。

360
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:38,630
咁鐵路咧就係以人為本，興建鐵路咧係為咗服務市民㗎。噉我哋係希望透過有效嘅社區聯絡工作，同社區保持雙向緊密緊密嘅聯繫，等社區瞭解鐵路嘅計劃內容，增加公眾嘅參與，令到鐵路個項目咧能夠配合到將來社區嘅發展。呢個明白啊，陳女士係好好啊。咁誒，我哋都最後一句啦。

361
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:58,640
就希望咧，我哋係誒，雖然咧鐵路，我哋係受制咗好多唔同嘅外在因素，未必可以採納到居民嘅所有意見。噉我哋咧都係希望咧係繼續同社區保持溝通，咁咧就有助我哋達至共識嘅。多謝。好，唔該曬你啊，陳女士。嗱，我哋時間咧剩翻十五分鐘，不過就有六位誒議員舉咗手，噉我。

362
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:09,910
我諗呢度畫條線啦，好嘛？第一輪畫條線，仲有乜人想問嘢？我哋咁六個咧，我諗我提議四分鐘一個啦，六四廿四。噉我哋都超時㗎啦，都超時十分鐘啦，四分鐘一位好唔好？

363
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:11,480
啊，黃國興議員。

364
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:19,390
多謝主席。主席咧就誒港鐵嗰啲介紹咧，就畀我感覺到就係唔係話佢哋唔做嘢。

365
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,480
噉啊！不過咧，就報喜不報憂。

366
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:37,450
我咧就作為係港島嘅民選議員咧，我想喺呢度咧係提出一個問題咧，誒請你哋回應同埋跟進啦。如果既然你哋講得咁關懷社區，講得咁好，

367
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:40,520
西港島線咧就通車在即。

368
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:48,620
西港島線其中喺西環嘅太白台咧，嗰度有成二百幾個居民。

369
01:07:49,250 --> 01:08:09,260
咁嗰度咧，而家就會成為孤島，因為港鐵嗰度佢係工程本嚟起一個電梯咧，就接駁咗上面太白台附近嘅民居咧，就可以較容易嚟去使用嗰個係鐵路嘅設施。但係你哋咧嗰個。

370
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:14,220
個所謂社區諮詢咧，偏偏就係忽視。

371
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:21,060
唔正視太白台居民佢哋嘅要求，嗰度有成係二百。

372
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:31,970
幾户嘅居民，而家咧，尤其是嗰度嘅傷殘人士咧，就係要行成過百級嘅石級，然後先可以落到地。

373
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:52,310
噉你哋咧就竟然唔諮詢佢哋，就取消咗原先咧就係有一個接駁嘅系統。好啦，而家西港島線通車在即啦，佢哋係變成孤島，而佢哋嘅投訴咧早喺上屆立法會就已經投訴嚟過立法會申訴部就。

374
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:52,660
係。

375
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:58,950
不得要領。呢一屆立法會，佢又嚟立法會申訴部，亦係投訴。

376
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:05,010
我哋而家實地視察咗，亦都咧係佢哋亦都開過記者招待會。

377
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:25,700
社會亦都係睇到嗰啲問題，點解鐵路偏偏睇唔到咧？廣鐵，所以咧，今日你呢個題目嚟得真好啦。我就希望廣鐵去回答點處理、點跟進。如果你起唔到一個接駁系統，你可唔可以整一個畀啲輪椅、傷？

378
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:35,030
殘人士可以喺地面去到太白台咧？如果唔係，嗰度嗰啲傷殘人士點算咧？你答埋呢個問題啦。

379
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,320
好，嗰啲代表。

380
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,590
西港島先，太白台。

381
01:09:40,870 --> 01:10:00,880
捷博系統取消咗。誒，多謝主席。我諗誒喺太白台，因為喺呢個誒最後我哋一個車站誒嘅起嘅時候咧，原來嗰個嘅海綿裏邊咧，我哋係考慮到有一啲電梯同埋扶手電梯咧，係一啲公眾嘅行人嘅誒。

382
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:16,940
誒接駁措誒設施嘅，咁喺個誒罕見嘅過程裏邊，因為誒經過居民嘅討論咧，就係誒周圍嘅居民有唔同嘅意見啦，咁所以到最後就冇包括咗喺呢個鐵路嗰個範圍裏邊嘅，咁所。

383
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:28,980
頭先討論到由車站連接到去到太白台咧，就係屬於誒附近嘅一啲嘅行人嘅誒接駁措施，就唔係屬於鐵路範圍嘅一部分嚟嘅。

384
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:46,670
主席，我要強烈咧係表示係不滿啊！因為你所講嘅話諮詢，佢哋居民嚟到立法會申訴部投訴，佢哋就係喺罕見之後，你取消你嘅計劃，冇被諮詢啊！關鍵喺呢一度。

385
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:56,340
點解你唔諮詢佢哋咧？而取消呢個接駁系統咧？問題喺呢一度啊嘛！而家你呢個剛才個報告就係報喜不報憂。

386
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:04,050
就係備咗呢啲，蘇女士，你哋有冇作出諮詢啫？幾時幾日有冇啲誒實際嘅資料畀我哋？你係做個諮詢啫。

387
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,490
而家就質疑你冇諮詢喎。

388
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:27,490
即係嗰啲居民咧，好開心啊！睇到有個接話嚟講，知道有，但係你取消唔話佢聽喎。等我先回應啊，先佢話佢有諮詢，你話冇係。啊，主席，或者我補充啊，因為我比較知詳細，因為我曾經都嚟過立法會裏面嘅嗰個case conference上一屆解釋。其實整個過程裏面咧，喺設計階段裏面咧，即係誒政。

389
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:47,500
政府同埋港鐵咧一齊就住呢個系統裡面咧，就有啲公眾諮詢會咧喺當地裡面咧舉行過嘅。咁收集咗意見之後咧，因為當時收翻嚟嘅意見咧，就因為如果建議起一一條天行人天橋嗰陣時，牽涉到一啲私隱嘅問題咧。嗱，我哋將呢個話你冇諮詢，你話你有，不如你將呢個實際資料時間。

390
01:11:47,500 --> 01:12:07,510
可以交畀黃議員，好冇？嚇嚇，我哋有呢個資料嘅，我哋可以有呢個資料嘅。嚇，多謝主席。好，我希望收到嗰啲實實際白紙實際資料先啦。如果唔係，而家口同鼻拗噉，根本都好啦。我哋而家鄧家彪議員啊，啊維，多多謝主席。咁當然呢五個工程即係新項目咧，就需要緊密咁同社區聯。

391
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:27,520
落啦，避免出現啦，照黃國英議員所講嗰啲問題啦嚇，報喜不報憂，取消嘅嘢唔講。咁但係咧，即係整個文件係寫鐵路項目，唔係寫新鐵路項目。咁所以咧，就究竟咧完成咗嘅鐵路項目，即係現有嘅線路，你哋係點樣同即係地區溝通咧？我諗當然地區嘅主要平台就係區議會啦。

392
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:47,530
誒我自己係離島區議員，當然離島就係東湧線啦。誒好老實講咧，就係誒港鐵彩虹西大咁賺咁多錢咧，但係我係多翻要求咧。我諗其實好多有鐵路嘅區議會都係咁講嘅，希望喺相關同交通有關委員會，港鐵係可以列席，必然列席。

393
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:50,540
喺交通事務委員會聽翻個民情。

394
01:12:50,830 --> 01:13:10,840
咁但係咧就成日都話咧有提問，我哋自然會出現，但係就亦都唔係每一次有提問咧都一定會出現，所以當然嗰陣時你哋一定係有忙嘅原因啦。咁但係可唔可能咁咧？就係話做好嗰個地區諮詢，誒係必然能夠作為一個劣質嘅人。

395
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:22,350
咧係即係坐喺區議會或者同即係交通相關嘅委員會裏面，令到大家真係覺得你哋係啊勇於同社區溝通，咁咧第一。

396
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:42,640
第二咧喺呢個新嘅工程項目咧，誒，我希望你哋即係喺稍後嘅彙報裏面，未必係今日咧，係講講咧係嗰個幕門工程，因為咧幕門工程當然唔能夠比呢五個鐵路嘅工程嗰個所謂重要性啊，或者係複雜性，甚至係個財務嗰個。

397
01:13:42,640 --> 01:14:02,650
即係個錢嘅重要咧。不過個唔同嘅地方咧，就係之前你上一次已經講解咗啲誒，完善啦嚇，東鐵完善起幕幕門咧，必須要第一就係月台加固，第二咧先至去擺個幕門上去，而全部都係深宵進行，因為咧即係呢啲東鐵或者馬鐵完。

398
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:22,660
線嘅社區即係基本上咧都建立曬㗎啦，即係話地鐵誒火車站側跟全部係有人住嘅，噉你又深宵興建咧係必然有滋擾嘅，咁所以睇下可唔可能咧諗一套即係更好嘅一個溝通咧，就喺即係東鐵馬鐵嗰個興建幕。

399
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:42,670
門嗰陣時，更好同嗰個地區係溝通得好，令到佢哋知咧幾時再嘈，即係嘈係陣痛咧，避免不了啦。但係即係人人都想望門，但係就即係呢個個個個溝通係要做得好，因為真係無可避免係會嘈嘅。深宵裡面嘅工程，我自己新報啊，我住即係大埔嘅。

400
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:46,450
港鐵站附近嘅嚇，預啲時間畀佢哋回應啊嚇。

401
01:14:47,340 --> 01:15:07,350
鄧議員，你嘅意思係希望佢哋列席區議會兩個問題。第一，希望佢哋次次都列席定係講起鐵路？佢哋才雄勢大，梗係可以次次列席。兩個月一次啫嘛。區議會會交通委員會係港鐵代表。誒，多謝主席。誒，多謝阿鄧議員嘅建議咧。咁喺誒地區裏邊咧，因為

402
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:27,360
誒交通事務都係會比較重要嘅事項，咁所以除咗會議之外，其實誒經常我哋嘅同事，尤其是一啲地區裏邊去做溝通嘅同事咧，亦都會同翻議員啊或者當地居民啊有一啲比較緊密嘅接觸。我明白議員嘅訴求嘅，不過我哋都睇到即係除咗議會之外咧，其實我。

403
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:47,370
我哋都有其他嘅誒唔同嘅渠道，我哋需要去維持個溝通。咁喺會議上面，如果有討論到鐵路事宜或者服務嗰方面咧，我哋都會盡量出席。就算即係冇辦法當時出席，都會有另外一啲嘅安排，儘量去配合翻大家嘅討論。咁講翻喺呢個東鐵同埋一啲嘅原有嘅車站。

404
01:15:47,370 --> 01:16:07,380
談深宵做工作呢一方面咧，尤其是誒而家誒進入咗去做一個月台，從誒誒呢個加固工程啦。咁誒裏邊嘅噪音係相當之多嘅。咁一方面，我哋就去諗緊一啲方法解決。大家都頭先有提到一月十號我哋嗰個嘅誒參觀嘅時候可以睇到點樣去減。

405
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:27,390
省呢啲噪音。另一方面咧，亦都用緊誒，我哋用咗一個information song，係喺車站裏邊嘅撥咗一啲角落出嚟咧，就同翻誒居民、當地嗰個乘客，即係每日出入站嗰個乘客去做一啲溝通，等佢知道嚟緊嘅工作係點樣樣。咁最近亦都透過車站一啲嘅唔同。

406
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:42,880
嘅海報啊，同埋一個電子嘅誒信號、電子資訊版咧，就希望畀翻當區嘅居民知道實際嘅情況。咁呢方面，我諗我哋亦都會再同翻當區居民，大家有多啲嘅聯繫，等佢哋知道個情況係點樣樣。

407
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:47,630
不過我哋嗰日咧提醒大家日間視察喎嚇，唔係深宵喎。

408
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:58,320
如果去感受一下深宵幾大件事咧，可能要安排另外一個啊，我都覺得值得深宵去聽聽，到底有幾擾民啊？阿梁國雄議員。主席。

409
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,190
嗰個問題咧，即係當一個非常之好嘅。

410
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:14,990
例子嚟啦，係咪？即係你出嚟諮詢嘅時候咧，就搞唔清楚邊啲係政府做，邊啲係地鐵就撈埋一嚿。咁跟住搞清楚之後，就話唔係你哋做，所以就唔負責。

411
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,060
噉。

412
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,520
阿優副局長。

413
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:31,900
你哋大股東嚟㗎嘛，係咪？你做下嘢得唔得啫？你飯店都喐緊喐嘢咯，係咪？一齊做咁其實咧就爭取阿黃光裕就爭取錯咗，因為梁井就話要要搞暢道啊嘛，係咪？

414
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:36,480
咁暢道加埋地鐵一齊做，點解做唔到嘅咧？

415
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,530
嗱，呢個揭示咗一個問題嘅。

416
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:45,520
就係咧，你哋嗰個所謂社區嘅聯絡工作咧，係完全失敗咯。

417
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:58,900
即係民隱不能畀你哋誒知，噉啊，梗係大件事啦。即係話有啲人有嘢想講畀你聽，聽講唔到啊。第二，你自己應想盡嘅責任都唔盡。嗱，舉個例。

418
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:14,540
呢個油油壇尾啊！我個選區啊，你哋起高鐵嗰啲水源搞到污染咗，投訴到爆啦！連曾蔭權嗰啲錦鯉都死曬啊！你知㗎，副局長，曾蔭權嗰樣錦鯉啊，啲水質畀佢影響咗，死曬，你成個錦鯉業冇咗。

419
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,950
咁點搞咧？

420
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:19,780
所以我覺得咧，講嚟係嘥時間嘅。

421
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,100
我覺得呢個地鐵咧，應該係撥翻一筆錢出嚟嘅。

422
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:35,020
就一個叫反對基金，即係話咧，你喺起你個工程嘅時候，工程嘅價值若干抽翻若干嘅百分比出嚟咧，畀嗰啲受影響人去反對你，包括係。

423
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:51,320
誒請社工隊、請專家、請呢個法律嘅誒代表嚟反對你。咁呢個你當然話我黐線㗎啦。但係老實講，喺政治上一樣，任何一個民主嘅國家都有反對派，反對派都係由工廠去資助佢反對個政府㗎。

424
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,790
餵！你而家你。

425
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:57,660
係等於政府咁犀利，你個財雄勢大，即係擁有嘅資產。

426
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,350
你哋有嘅權力。

427
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,830
我覺得，如果一係香港唔用呢個制度咧，冇得搞。

428
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:08,270
只有人，你畀錢人反對你，個反對先有效。第一。

429
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,120
第二咧就係。

430
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:17,090
你哋冇交代到一樣嘢，即係冇獎罰嘅。你列個清單，你哋想check out嘅問題有幾多個？

431
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,860
End up係你哋check嘅問題，check冇check到，第二啲問題走咗出嚟，咁有冇獎賞？

432
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:29,650
有冇先？你哋唔使負責任㗎嘛？你哋你哋話哦，我哋去。

433
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,090
睇嗰啲問題，睇咗之後。

434
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:36,820
原來唔係人哋話第啲問題，噉你有冇一個清單對比嘅咧？

435
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,980
我哋我哋睇咗啲清單，咪可以check你咯。

436
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:44,020
呢個呢個呢個第第二個，第三個咧就係。

437
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,310
喺呢一個誒？

438
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:54,410
講翻太白台嗰樣嘢，呢個吸收教訓啦。董建華走去出巡啊，去炮台山。

439
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:03,280
站啊！哇，咁都係唔得㗎，噉樣一日行上去，咁咪即刻嗱嗱聲起啫嘛！嗰個lift，嗱好簡單。

440
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:13,720
啊！啊，主席，其實好簡單。如果嗰個係地產項目咧，兩秒而家剩翻分鐘，你上唔上？唔係我，我我唔係我，佢係答我哋，從來都冇乜興趣，我有數落佢哋。

441
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:34,070
如果嗰個係你哋嘅地產項目啊，閣上商場啊，撲到整電梯啦。而家因為太白台根本就冇商業價值㗎嘛，又冇起地鐵相關嘅樓盤，噉啊冇咯。你係商業運作嚟㗎嘛，所以即係黃強就唔明呢樣嘢。

442
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,170
政府唔盡責任，地鐵又唔盡責任。

443
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:42,050
所以我講嚟講去，畀錢人反對你，畀法例人哋反對你。

444
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,490
講完。

445
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,420
有冇人想回應？

446
01:20:46,730 --> 01:21:06,740
主席，我真係簡單回應一下。其實誒港，因為港鐵嘅任何嘅鐵路工程咧，佢都有一定嘅範圍嘅。咁喺嗰個我哋通常去到地區諮詢嗰陣時，當然我哋都明白居民有好多想誒誒誒有誒一啲要求，希望一啲連播。噉我哋都喺個範圍裏邊咧，我哋都覺得有啲清晰界定，有啲係可能屬於港鐵嘅範圍，但有。

447
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:26,750
有啲可能係屬於超出咗個範圍之後咧，咁政府都會借呢個機會都睇下，究竟喺喺嗰個公共工程上高呢啲有冇相配合。我舉一個例子，譬如喺沙中線裏邊咧，我哋嘅一啲嘅行人嘅接駁咧，其實我哋去到誒喺黃大，即係喺啊一路上去慈雲山咧，其實咧我哋都係借呢個機會咧，都係做。

448
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:46,760
相關嘅嘢嘅噉，所以我哋覺得唔係話完全唔理。個相啊，不如太白噉。你太白台點解？太白台太白台做個例子啦。既然佢哋都話呢樣嘢好似冇人冇人去冇人去照顧噉，但係噉你撇咗喺度咁點咧？不如你哋用呢個做一個case study去睇睇，可唔可以拉近啲啦？同居民嘅訴求好唔好？

449
01:21:46,870 --> 01:22:06,880
主主席，誒，我我哋其實，睇辦台喺過往嚟講咧，係處理過、討論過喺誒個案，即係立法會嘅個案裏邊都係討論過嘅。咁裏邊嘅問題其實都比較充分交代。咁當然我哋稍我哋正如之前誒，我哋同事講啦，我哋稍後有關有資料會畀翻議員，等大家都明白當時嗰個誒考慮係點樣樣嚇。

450
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:26,890
下一位係誒謝偉全議員係多謝主席。就香港當然地鐵喺效率設施啊、保養維修各方面咧，其實都係相當高嘅水平嘅。噉啊，呢個其實我都好欣賞。咁但係咧，就即係同使用者同埋社區咧保持溝通咧，係好重要。

451
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:47,290
噉啊！我諗即係而家誒，市民對地鐵方面咧，基本上咧，即係都希望有兩方面咧注意。第一咧，就當然係個票價問題啦。咁今日唔講啦。第二咧，就係個舒適度，因為你要提供一個即係話便捷、舒適、可靠嘅咁舒適，其中係一個問題。

452
01:22:47,610 --> 01:23:07,620
咁舒適咧同個擠迫度咧，其中有個關係。咁尤其是喺高峯啊，上落班嘅時候。咁其實呢方面咧，噉啊，你諮詢嗰個誒社區啊等等咧，有講喺設計階段咧，但係我又唔知道咧有冇講畀我哋市民聽啊喺地鐵車廂嘅設

453
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:27,630
計嚟講咧，嗰個標準係乜嘢？譬如一平方米係假設可以站立幾多個啊人啊？呢方面咧，我問咗好多次都答唔到嘅。咁同埋咧，如果你有個標準啊，主席，你設計成有標準呢個標準，譬如話原本係五個人嘅，佢係咪去到七個人或者八？

454
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:47,640
八個人咧，然後先會採取呢個舒緩措施咧，譬如加班啊、等等，或者加加呢個密度啊、等等。咁呢方面咧喺誒，即係我覺得諮詢社區啊，或者等等咧，我又好似唔多覺有提呢樣嘢。主要提咧就係建造上有舒緩措施啦，誒，但係使用將來。

455
01:23:47,640 --> 01:24:07,650
使用我想知道咧喺呢方面咧，其實有冇提醒我哋？其實將來個設計嚟講咧，地鐵係咪係個設計誒誒好到而家嚟講咧，即係誒咁擠逼咧？咁當然咧，即係佢哋畀啲數字就話唔好擠逼嘅，百分之七十到嘅係高峯期。咁但係你有來去兩班㗎嘛？譬如喺金鐘。

456
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:27,810
你誒去過九龍，梗係逼過喺金鐘。你去到中環啦，噉你兩個溝埋嚟講，係冇得講嘅，即係咁呢個唔反映現實嘅。噉我就想問，究竟即係嗰個即係考慮個設計方面個標準有冇咧？即係譬如話幾多個人啊一平方米可以站啦，去到。

457
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:47,820
邊個程度先唔可以容忍咧？唔該。嗱，我提醒各位咧，我哋下一個會議二月廿八號，其中嘅議程咧就係舒緩港鐵列車車廂擠迫情況。講到時咧，我哋可以深入探討。不過今日咧，或者你哋作初步回應。喺個新鐵路喺諮詢區內嘅時候，對於擠迫情況。

458
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:48,640
講你哋點㗎？

459
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:59,050
嗯，主席，如果喺嗯一誒頭先啊謝議員提嗰個誒設計標準咧，我哋就冇用一個噉樣樣嘅標準去做一個諮詢工作。

460
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:19,340
但最主要，無論係新鐵路或者現有嘅鐵路咧，我哋都係希望用一啲嘅班次咧去配合翻當區嗰個需要。譬如好似大家而家比較集中注意到金鐘係比較擠塞嘅話咧，噉我哋就會用一啲嘅班次，令到去嗰個每個小時，尤其是大家講話向緊中環方向翻工嘅時候，向緊中環方向。

461
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:39,350
或者星期六日，大家去緊銅鑼灣嗰個嘅方向嗰個班次咧，我哋係盡量將佢增加，去到令到嗰個舒適度增加嘅。咁誒，譬如過去一年，我哋增加咗二千五百班班車，主要都係針對一啲咧，尤其是繁忙時間、繁忙時段嗰啲地方。

462
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:40,350
明道。

463
01:25:40,630 --> 01:26:00,640
乘客嘅舒適度可以增加到，但係有一樣嘢咧，就係喺個鐵路誒，我哋由於信號系統去配合我哋嘅班次咧，係誒增加咧會有一個極限，就冇辦法再加到落去。咁呢個咧就講緊一個長遠嗰個鐵路規劃上，再用一啲新線去到去到做一啲舒緩，或者其他路面去到做。

464
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:20,650
舒緩嘅咁呢個就誒喺誒，因為鐵路本身佢嗰個誒信號系統係有限，我哋亦都好難用一啲諮詢或者居民嘅意見咧，就將呢個嘅技術嗰個方面咧嚟到去去矀正嘅嚇。主席，我哋下一次再講啦，或者畀主席提。嗱，今日時間就冇啦，咁下一次你又走唔甩。

465
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:26,510
嘅啦，擠逼呢個問題咧，我哋下次你一定要清楚交代個定義。

466
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:46,800
我哋社會有個共識嘅定義係乜？你嘅七成，你覺得高過七成，你先要做嘢。但係香港好多人覺得七成佢唔接受，可能要五成好嘛？你第日下次準備充足嚟。而下一位係陳林斌議員，係誒，多謝主席。噉就誒，事實上港鐵嘅社區聯絡咧，其實係。

467
01:26:46,800 --> 01:27:06,810
遠遜色於啊，我哋社會嘅兩大機構啦，一個係中電，一個煤氣，佢哋喺社區嘅聯絡上面咧做得誒有聲有色，都值得港鐵去參考。噉啊，我今日兩個問題希望瞭解一下嘅，第一個咧就係即係港鐵喺過去咧，我哋喺舊年亦都係有一個問

468
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,740
係問咗港鐵，就係。

469
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:29,030
即係個公正行個問題，好多時咧，即係地區有好多嘅議員又好，居民又好咧。每當佢哋受到一啲誒，即係不公平或者係有啲裂痕需要claim錢嘅時候咧，咁港鐵好多時都會派個公正行去同佢誒，即係去check下，做個報告出嚟。咁但

470
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:49,040
係好多時，往往咧呢個公正報告咧出嚟就係話哦，唔關佢裂痕咧，唔關港鐵嘅工程師噉啊，令到居民咧其實一路都係有個質疑咧，就係究竟公正行係咪偏幫誒港鐵而造成一個不公正嘅現象咧？噉我想問下港鐵，其實誒會唔會？

471
01:27:49,040 --> 01:28:09,050
會有一個更加有效益嘅誒賠償機制，令到市民喂啊遇到一啲咩問題，基本上簡單直接有啲賠償咧，係畀咗市民，令到市民咧對於工程有冇咁大不滿誒？收咗啲地區投訴咧，其實亦都係好簡單去處理，就唔好將個程序。

472
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:26,290
複雜化，噉我想問下港鐵會唔會設立一套噉嘅機制，去誒即係令到市民有一個比較簡單直接嘅申索渠道。第二個咧就係誒港鐵喺頭先阿鄧家彪議員都提過咧，就係同區議會個溝通，我想。

473
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:46,660
瞭解下咧，港鐵到底有冇試過主動啲啊？去同區議會去溝通。究竟你哋喺過去一年裏面啊，你同區議會誒溝通咗幾多次，開咗幾多次會？誒呢一方面有冇數據畀我哋？等我哋可以瞭解下啊，港鐵究竟同區議？

474
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,960
有幾多嘅溝通咧？唔該。

475
01:28:50,080 --> 01:29:10,090
港鐵代表誒好啊！多謝主席，或者我簡單答咗第一個誒第二個問題，區議會嘅溝通咧。區議會嘅溝通，除咗頭先我都講過，除咗誒一啲嘅會議誒嘅方面咧，我哋會去誒出席唔同嘅會議啦。有時亦都會因應一啲誒實際嘅需求，譬如地區裏邊啲安排，我哋會主動。

476
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:30,100
佢要求話：我哋可唔可以傾一啲嘅問題？咁當然呢個唔單止係會議嘅，我哋亦都透過一啲地區嘅活動小組咧。相信大家可能都有聽過，我哋用緊地區嘅聯絡小組，就係每一年去安排唔同嘅活動，有時畀誒議員去了解，譬如參觀呢個誒控制中心啊，或者參觀一啲我哋嘅鐵路。

477
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:50,110
嘅設施啊，等到地區嗰個彼此嗰個理互相嘅理解係比較多啲嘅。咁至於第二個關於公證行，誒公證行嗰個做法咧，就係其實如果我哋一般同一般我哋買保險嗰個情況一樣，如果有任何嘅誒彼此之間誒對一個工程，

478
01:29:50,110 --> 01:30:10,120
可能造成嘅影響，誒覺得會係誒需要一個第三者獨立方去睇嘅話咧，噉我哋就會由公證行去做。咁誒，如果嗰個情況實際上我哋一睇到已經係由於譬如我哋承建商入場有啲損毀嘅話，嗰個係唔需要經過公證行去做嘅。譬如我哋有一啲個案。

479
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:30,130
就係誒誒承建商去碰爛咗人哋一啲地磚，咁呢個係有實證，大家亦都睇到嘅。咁通常會有一啲咧，就係冇辦法誒彼此都難以去證明誒嗰個關係，或者係邊個引致一啲嘅損失嘅。噉我哋就會交由公證行，亦都係雙方同意交由公證行去。

480
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:30,830
睇。

481
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:51,120
咁證行咧就誒，佢亦都唔係話誒去偏幫，因為佢係要基於一啲獨立嘅資料，譬如我哋喺誒施工嘅時候一啲震動嘅記錄啊，有冇施工嘅記錄啊，或者佢之前嘅一啲實地勘察嘅資料嚟到比較咁誒。而呢一個做法咧，亦都係國際上認許嘅一啲嘅安全嗰個。

482
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,430
同埋一啲嘅保險安排嘅做法嚟嘅。

483
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:56,760
好，魯威國議員。

484
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:11,990
主席，就喺呢個誒西港島線咧設計同埋建造期間咧，都有唔少當區居民嘅投訴咧，就關於個通風井嘅噪音同埋空氣污染嘅問題。

485
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:32,280
誒當時，我覺得係一個獨立嘅誒處理啲投訴嘅委員會嘅成員噉，所以都聽到即係市民嘅擔心。當然，作為專業工程師咧，我就理解呢通風井咧其實就唔係排污嘅，因為個條路運作咧，因為佢電氣化嘅條路，亦都唔會有咩嘅嘅嘅即係污染嘅空氣排出，主要咧。

486
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:52,290
咧就為呢個對流，特別係咧列車通過管道嘅時間咧，就推動空氣咧，需要有一個推即係對流嘅作用。咁但係畢竟咧，當時咧都係喺地區嚟講咧，都引起好大嘅關注。噉我就想了解下咧，就因為呢個問題都有普遍性嘅，因為其他嘅不同嘅地區咧都有相。

487
01:31:52,290 --> 01:32:08,840
相關嘅投訴、相關嘅關注，噉我想了解下喺西港島線，誒而家喺呢方面嘅情況點樣？係咪居民嘅擔心都平息咗？同埋咧有其他即係相關嘅誒地區類似問題咧，就目前嘅狀況係點樣？多謝主席。

488
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:30,030
港鐵代表誒，好啊！多謝主席。誒，通風井咧喺誒西港島線係籌建嘅時候、設計嘅時候咧係好多嘅討論嘅。噉我哋亦都喺過去幾年用咗唔同嘅方式咧去解釋翻畀居民知道通風井係點樣樣嘅一個運作。咁除咗解釋之外，我亦都誒安排咗好多唔同嘅參觀。

489
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:50,040
尤其是現有嘅鐵路一啲通風井，我哋去到個車站裏邊，或者喺一個山邊嘅通風井，等居民實地去睇完之後，瞭解咗個通風井嘅作用係點樣樣啊？去嗰度嘅空氣質素，或者直情入到去通風井裏邊睇到個空氣質素係點樣樣？咁呢個係有幫助舒緩到嗰個居民嘅疑。

490
01:32:50,040 --> 01:33:10,050
類嘅，咁當然而家嚟緊就嚟通車啦。可能有啲居民係新搬入去啊，或者佢對於以往嗰個溝通啊、以往嗰個實地考察啊，佢都冇印象嘅。咁喺呢一方面，我哋仍然都會繼續去做。至於其他新鐵路，譬如好似係南港島線啊、沙中線啊噉，喺過去。

491
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:30,060
佢嘅討論裏邊咧，通風井因為都係一個社會上比較普遍講嘅議題，咁大家都會有提出嘅疑慮咯。咁因為我哋頭先都講過，我哋做咗好多少誒呢個誒誒美專嘅一啲嘅卡通啊，咁亦都利用嗰啲唔同嘅工具去到誒向公眾講解，或者喺學校裏邊講。

492
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:40,520
係比較多咗，而家大家嘅認識係多咗嘅，咁但係我諗喺呢方面，我哋都會繼續努力，因為誒始終都會有一啲即係未聽過嘅，突然間亦都會提出嚟咯。

493
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,650
好，多謝主席，冇問題。

494
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,890
好，唔該曬啊！我哋誒呢個議程到呢度為止啦。

495
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:51,370
噉我哋而家進入下一個議程，就第五項。

496
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:55,580
就港鐵嘅路軌檢查制度。

497
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,220
咁麻煩港鐵誒有關同事、相關同事進場啊！

498
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,180
今日有文件C.B.一六三七零七。

499
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:30,320
八。

500
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:36,400
噉啊，就港鐵方面啦，立法會秘書處方面啦，啲背景資料大家都有㗎啦嚇。

501
01:34:50,190 --> 01:35:10,200
或者爭取時間啊，副局長。係。你有冇？主席係，我簡單做一個開場。啊，主席，政府一向要求同埋期望港鐵公司咧，必須致力提供安全可靠嘅鐵路服務。喺路軌檢查方面咧，港鐵公司定期咧係以三種嘅方法，包括超聲波嘅軌道。

502
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:20,850
探測、目視檢查同埋染料嘅滲透測試嘅檢查去路軌，確保路軌嘅結構係安全可靠㗎，防患於未然。

503
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:41,140
港鐵早前係最新引引入一架先進嘅超聲波軌道探測車，可以更快捷同埋仔細噉樣檢查路軌，及早去發現路軌上不規律嘅情況，以便咧係及早去維修，未雨綢繆，減少服務受影響機會。而機電工程署作為監

504
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:52,910
鐵路系統嘅安全機構咧，亦都會定期咁去巡查港鐵公司是否已經進行各項必要嘅鐵路系統保養維修工程，確保鐵路嘅安全。

505
01:35:53,190 --> 01:36:09,480
我哋呢度誒請誒港鐵方面咧喺度對於佢哋最新引入嘅誒超聲波軌道探測車嘅功能咧誒同埋佢嘅運作咧向大家介紹一下嚇。係港鐵代表邊位？主席各位議員，今次我想簡介一下港鐵嘅。

506
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:15,080
路軌嘅檢查制度，同埋我哋新買嘅超聲波軌道探測車。

507
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,690
而喺開始之前咧，等我先講一講軌路軌嘅設計啊。

508
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:29,640
路軌嘅設計係以安全為本，港鐵網絡裡面嘅路軌亦都唔例外。而路軌係由鋼鐵製造，其實本身已經好堅固嘅。

509
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:45,500
但係同其他金屬一樣，亦都會有機會出現呢個裂紋或者裂縫。呢一個係一個自然嘅現象，但係喺路軌嘅設計嘅時候，我哋都已經預咗呢個裂縫嘅出現，所以喺設計裏面咧已經包含咗安全嘅係數。

510
01:36:45,870 --> 01:37:00,710
我哋每隔兩尺左右咧，就會用鋼構咧將路軌咧緊固地咧就鎖喺依一個嘅路基上面嘅。而即使路軌出現裂縫咧，路軌亦都唔會移位，列車亦都可以繼續安全噉樣喺路軌上面行走。

511
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:10,280
而事實上，港鐵一直維持可靠嘅鐵路服務咧，其中一個主要嘅原因就係有一個完善嘅路軌檢查制度。

512
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:21,460
除咗目視檢查同埋染料滲透測試之外咧，我哋一直都有應用超聲波軌道探測車咧去偵查路軌嘅不規律嘅情況。

513
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:33,670
我哋亦都有一路留意有關嘅科技發展，而今次引入一部先進嘅探測車，就係想進一步咁提升我哋路軌檢查嘅科技水平同埋能力。

514
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:38,450
相信大家明白，不斷提升偵測嘅能力係非常之重要。

515
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:53,030
而只要能夠及早發現一啲路軌嘅不規律嘅情況，例如初期裂紋或者磨損等等，然後進行預防性嘅維修，就可以將因為路軌事故而令到服務有疑問嘅情況減少。

516
01:37:53,530 --> 01:38:01,350
正如一開始所講，我哋喺二零一三年一月引入咗一部先進嘅超聲波軌道探測車。

517
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:12,370
而呢部探測車喺澳洲製造嘅，造價要四千六百萬，係現時屬於好先進嘅探測車，能夠探測到更細微嘅不規律情況。

518
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:25,890
喺時速三十公里以下咧，佢可以維持每隔兩毫米嘅距離咧，就發射超聲波。而比舊款嘅探測車每隔四毫米咧，係精密著精密度咧係提高咗一倍。

519
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:29,610
而舊款嘅探測車嘅時速只係十幾公里啫。

520
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:39,520
由此可以見到咧，新嘅探測車嘅偵測到更細微、更少嘅不規律情況之外咧，亦都可以提升咗路軌嘅檢查嘅效率。

521
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:45,360
而我哋而家再仔細咁睇一睇新嘅探探測車嘅偵測組件咧。

522
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:58,210
探測車底部有兩個滾輪式嘅探頭，總共有十四個，左右兩邊七個唔同嘅角度發射呢個超聲波，探測軌道裡面嘅內部。

523
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:05,890
而喺架車喺個軌道上面行走嘅時候咧，探頭就會分別接觸軌道兩旁嘅鋼軌。

524
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:11,590
超聲波信號就會透過探頭咧傳送到車上面嘅電腦進行分析。

525
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:21,630
根據接收器所接收到嘅反射信號嘅強弱同埋時間差等等咧，就可以知道路軌內內部有冇不規律嘅情況。

526
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:30,240
新嘅探測車嘅電腦屏幕係會顯示超聲波嘅反射幅度。若果出現不規律嘅情況，

527
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:33,940
就會代表路軌裏面就可能有缺損。

528
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:51,460
系統就會發出聲響同埋影像提示，仲會即時作出分類，以深度同大小做識別。例如圖中所見到咧，藍色部分就表示有輕微嘅不規律情況，而紅色嘅就會比較表示比較明顯嘅不規律情況。

529
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:56,840
新嘅蛋撻車亦都擁有記憶同埋實時比較嘅功能。

530
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:12,740
檢查路軌嘅時候咧，就可以記錄低有關嘅情況。當下一次再檢查同一個路段嘅時候咧，探測車上面嘅電腦咧就可以進行比對分析，讓工程人員可以評估到個狀況有冇進一步嘅發展。

531
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:17,990
幫助我哋更加有效噉樣計劃進行預防性嘅維修嘅時間。

532
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:21,420
同埋有需要嘅時候，跟換路軌。

533
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:27,160
超聲波探測嘅優點係可以偵測到路軌裡面嘅內臟啊！

534
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,570
而包括最細微嘅變化。

535
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:38,450
提供一個高解像度嘅資料，以便我哋嘅工程人員咧有效噉樣規劃同埋實施軌道維修同埋更新嘅工作。

536
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:46,460
為咗方便各位議員更加瞭解呢部探測車嘅運作咧，我哋準備咗大約一分鐘長嘅短片咧，想播畀大家睇嘅。

537
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:15,560
呢一部就係我哋新嘅軌道嘅探測車。

538
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:33,700
而依個畫面就睇到嘅就係我哋頭先所講嘅滾輪式嘅探頭，而中間兩個大嘅塔就係嗰兩個大嘅探頭，裡面嘅就分別就有唔同嘅探頭喺裏面。

539
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:40,300
而每邊就會各有一個就接觸嘅軌道，而發射超聲波。

540
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:56,790
我哋睇到呢個就係我哋嘅探測工作人員嘅顯示嘅界面，而畫面上面同下邊就分別可以睇到之前同之後兩次唔同嘅檢測，可以作出實時嘅比較。

541
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:01,790
而我哋每次做完嘢之後，我哋都會收翻起嗰個探測嘅。

542
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:05,930
搓裂噉就可以咧，就完完成呢個工作嘅。

543
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,770
係，多。

544
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:28,320
如果各位議員咧有興趣參加或者更加瞭解我哋呢個部嘅新嘅探測車咧，我哋可以作出安排嘅。多謝各位。好，唔該曬。阿黃國興議員，誒，多謝主席，幾多分鐘啊？五分鐘。主席，多謝你。我想咧就係問當局咧，而家呢個新嘅超聲波探測車落個地之後咧。

545
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,300
佢幾耐就會？

546
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:51,620
在行駛中嘅使用緊嘅鐵路咧，係探測一次咧，係咪一晚可以全部探得曬咧？或者嗰個週期點樣？呢個第一個問題。第二咧，就既然有探測車啦，嗰啲用人手誒目視同埋攜嗰個誒超聲波探傷儀。

547
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,340
用人手去做嗰啲，係唔係同時都做嘅咧？

548
01:42:55,620 --> 01:43:15,630
咁當然呢啲嗰個效率梗係不及嗰個探測車嘅。咁喺噉嘅情況底下，你哋嗰個調配，大家之間嗰個間隔係點樣咧？因為我哋最關注嘅就係嗰個鐵路嘅安全。假如係一部探測車唔能夠係一晚。

549
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:18,340
揾走曬所有嘅路軌。

550
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:23,070
係咪可以多購置一步咧？其實呢個問題有冇考慮咧？三個問題。

551
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:43,960
我哋代表阿黃生係係好多謝議員嘅提問。其實我哋整個系統入邊咧，總共有三部嘅探測車嘅。咁如果你話講翻喺個探即係探測嘅週期嚟講咧，噉我哋其實就係話觀塘線以觀塘線或者荃灣線為例咧，我哋每兩星期係做一次嘅。咁

552
01:43:43,960 --> 01:44:03,970
咁另外，你所講嘅其他即係話用人眼嘅檢查，或者係嗰個其他嘅用人手嘅檢查咧，其實我哋繼續維持嘅。而我哋用目視嚟講，我哋每三日會做一次目視啦。而用呢個人手嘅檢查咧，其實我哋每三個月至六個月不等咧，就喺唔同嘅軌段咧係會進行呢個嘅人手嘅檢查。

553
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:04,390
嘅。

554
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:19,070
主席，我想跟進問咧，就誒剛才聽到你哋有三部探測車，咁而家喺所有嘅誒咁多條路線嘅幾耐會完成一個週期咧？

555
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:33,470
係。如果我哋喺繁忙嘅路段咧，就係兩個星期嘅。咁如果係比較疏嘅班次，譬如馬鞍山線等等，係六個星期一次。

556
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,940
夠唔夠咧？嚇，其實噉樣。

557
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:56,600
即係點解唔可以提高？即係更加頻密，即係因為始終佢係機械化，而且個速度又又高，誒嗰個效率又係好。咁當然係比人手誒拎嗰個超聲波探傷儀係更加更加有效果啦。當然目視我，我係知道唔能夠取。

558
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:00,510
取代嘅牧士都需要，所以我冇講過話要取代牧士。

559
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:13,060
我就係想問點解唔可以加密嗰個啊頻密嘅程度，而更大面積去取代用手攜嘅超聲波探傷儀？

560
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:34,100
嗱，我哋阿阿黃議員，我哋而家講緊三樣嘢。牧士咧，其實睇唔到裂紋嘅，牧士係睇鑊釘嘅啫，係睇條軌有冇同個塊板啊有啲有啲脱離嘅啫。咁所以主要睇裂紋咧就係手提嗰個同埋架車。噉我諗你哋要解釋清楚，係唔係車做咗嘅嘢？

561
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:35,470
手提。

562
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:55,780
其實車做曬手提嘅嘢，既然係噉，咁點解要兩樣嘢咧？佢兩樣嘢嘅功能有咩分別？係嚇，咁可以，可以直誒再講清楚嘅。咁多謝議員嘅提問。咁其實車嚟講咧，主要咧就係檢查我哋一啲叫做平直嘅路軌啦。嚇，咁所以我哋都係有一個定嘅週期，要我哋定呢個。

563
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:15,790
週期咧睇翻個週嘅負再重嘅再重嘅重量啊，路軌嘅設計啊，同埋參考咗世界各地嘅各同嘅業界嘅定嘅標準嚟定嘅。咁亦都我哋定呢個標準咧，以啲尤其是喺超聲波嗰度咧，已經係全世界嚟畀你話，你應該要做到最密㗎啦。咁

564
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:35,800
而點解仲要有一個手動嘅嘅探測咧？其實係用唔同嘅部檢嘅檢查嘅，因為有啲地方咧，其實超聲波探測車咧係做唔到依個檢查嘅。譬如一啲道叉啊嘅位置咧，我哋係要以依個手動嘅或者用手嘅手作。

565
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:45,870
嘅超聲波或者係一個滲透染料嘅工作咧，就去做翻呢一方面嘅檢查嘅。咁所以其實係兩樣嘢係相輔相成，係唔可以缺少嘅。

566
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,440
對唔住，車做到嘅嘢，手。

567
01:46:51,280 --> 01:47:11,290
有啲部有啲有啲方面做唔到，冇錯，係邊方面咧？譬如喺個道叉，即係話噉話手做到嘅嘢咧，有啲嘢車做唔到嘅，呢個我聽到啦。係係啊，嗱，譬如就係話喺個道叉嗰度，道叉嘅話其實個金屬嘅結構咧，同我哋嘅路軌係有唔同嘅。噉佢用嘅超聲波係唔能夠好有效。

568
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:17,090
噉樣去做，所以我哋就輔助咧，就係要依個滲透染料嘅測試咧，去做翻嘅。

569
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:22,470
冇跟進啦。好，下一位係誒，鄧家彪議員。

570
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:31,600
都係主席誒，當然即係頭先主主題都係介紹嗰個即係新購置一月啟用嘅超聲波嗰架測試車啦。

571
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:48,750
但係我都係比較關心咧，誒你所用嘅維修團隊就承接翻上次將軍澳線嗰個討論咧，就係我睇翻立法會畀我哋嘅資料咧，路軌巡邏作目視檢查，將軍澳線咧應該喺一一年咧都係七十二小時一次。

572
01:47:49,060 --> 01:48:09,070
噉啊，同其他都係相約或者係一樣嘅，即係大概一個禮拜兩次到。我想問啦，誒，我估都係嘅，就係係咪將軍澳線係咁多條鐵港鐵鐵路線裏面係全部嘅目視檢查嘅維修人員或者係保養人員都係外判承辦商所聘請工。

573
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:10,640
有係咪咧？

574
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:11,720
嗯。

575
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:22,080
其實成個將軍澳線嚟講咧，其實有四個係負責目視同埋一其他一般嘅誒檢查嘅，噉。

576
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:42,370
而其他包括我哋而家講緊嘅超聲波探測車咧，或者係我哋用嘅叫做其他手作嘅超聲波嘅檢查咧，都係由我哋自己港鐵嘅員工負責嘅。我我即係我想聽聽清楚，咁將軍澳線嘅目視檢查嘅工作人員負責將軍澳線嘅係全。

577
01:48:42,370 --> 01:49:02,380
全部都係外判承辦商所聘請工人咧，定係有啲係港鐵直接員工，有啲係外判承辦商咧。如果就住目視嚟講，係由承辦商負責嘅，即係全部都係。係。而呢個亦都係咁多條線路裡面咧，唯一一條線路係有。議員，你問嘅全部你係講緊路軌定係講緊？路軌，我就係講。

578
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:05,640
正係路鬼啫，係啦，路鬼嘅牧師。

579
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:25,980
係嘅，噉我想問啦，呢個人手比例啦，即係當然我哋都尊重嘅嗰個工人嘅專業性，但係呢個人手比例，你話四名咁同其他路線按，譬如話個鐵路個個長度個拉運嚟講，嗰人手比例係咪一樣咧？定係佢哋叻啲天可以係？

580
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:35,450
少啲人可以做到多啲嘅嘢。嗯，其實就住我哋牧事嘅要求咧，其實每七十二小時巡一次咧，佢哋係有足夠嘅人手係應付嘅。

581
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:41,670
咁即係話，你哋其實唔管佢有幾多人，只要你做咗七十二小時一次就得啦，係咪啊？

582
01:49:41,950 --> 01:50:01,960
我哋定呢一個嘅服務嘅合約，其實我哋定咗佢哋嘅服務嘅要求，噉佢哋要達到我哋服務嘅要求，噉我哋係要有亦都有我哋嘅工程嘅人員咧，係定期噉樣監測去睇我哋做成點嘅。誒，即係話唔好意思，即係短問短答，希望你唔好介意，我唔係唔禮貌。即係我想問清楚，即係話你哋個。

583
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:07,530
個合約裏面並冇規定佢一定要有幾多嘅人數。

584
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:30,010
我哋嘅定嘅係要要求個承辦商係做到某一方面，做到我哋嘅服務嘅指標嘅，而只佢哋達到我哋呢個服務嘅指標咧，我哋就係係可以㗎啦。我舉個例，譬如馬鞍山線，誒呢個幕士嘅工作人員，你直接員工啦，應該知有幾多人啊？

585
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:31,080
幾多人啊？

586
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:35,750
一。

587
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:56,390
我就暫時就冇依一個資料喺依度，嗱，我想講翻咧，其實我哋嘅員工咧係唔單止做牧師啦，佢唔做牧師嘅時間咧，亦都會做其他嘅嘅檢查嘅。但係套翻轉咧，國外判商都一樣嘅啫，佢請啲科技翻嚟咧，今唔使做牧師做其他都有㗎嘛。不過你講咗係四名，就係牧師及一般。

588
01:50:56,390 --> 01:51:00,700
檢測乜嘛，係噉我所以想做個對比咯。係，我相信。

589
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:21,020
誒，我哋都係話每七十二小時，如果係能夠做得到嘅話，我哋都係係滿意嘅。嗱，啊主席，即係我都係睇咧立法會準備畀我哋嗰啲文件咧，就喺嗰個誒附錄二啊，噉啊，就有一個列表，好好啊，就有十三十四次嘅記錄咧，就係嗰個各種路。

590
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:28,620
線即係出現裂紋嘅情況，好合考，珠江路線好靚，一次都冇。不過咧，即係大家。

591
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:48,910
知民情嘅人咧就會諗，究竟係保養得好一次都冇啊，定係睇唔到有問題咧？即係我我唔想有個結論，但係誒將軍澳線咁獨特嘅保養嘅方法，即係全部由外判商，我哋係繼續有質疑嘅。阿主席可唔可能要求佢哋補加啲資料咧？就係各路線究竟？

592
01:51:48,910 --> 01:52:08,920
喺目視檢查上面，究竟嗰個人手係有幾多？即係直接員工嘅，誒負責嘅有幾多？外判嘅有幾多？畀一個大概嘅即係數字，畀我哋比較一下。因為呢啲係眼功夫嚟嘅，人手少啲就冇時間，就少啲去睇㗎啦。我唔明點樣可以加快效率，唔該。

593
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,240
啊！

594
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:13,090
冇問題啊嘛！呢個而家啲資料，好啊。

595
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:14,190
唔該曬。

596
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:20,280
噉啊，最後就係輪到我有啲誒，我問個好簡單嘅問題嘅啫，不過就。

597
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:23,480
講起。

598
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,300
喺誒維修。

599
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,980
檢查方面。

600
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:32,680
我一個好簡單問題：點解港鐵需要外判？

601
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,700
呢個好簡單嘅問題。

602
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:36,510
係因為成本。

603
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,160
低啲。

604
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,850
依位是。

605
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:41,900
因為你請唔到人。

606
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,220
所以要靠佢哋咧。

607
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:50,410
可唔可以解釋下？你有啲嘢自己做，有啲嘢外判。咁點解要外判咧？

608
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:54,610
一個基本上社會上對於鐵路安全。

609
01:52:54,890 --> 01:53:05,170
大家都有個意識，就係自己人點都好過外判工。雖然你哋話誒標準啊，所有啲嘢啊一式一樣。

610
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,660
噉我之前都有講過啦。

611
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:13,180
外判工而家做啲嘢唔係用機械做嘅，多數判出嚟就係目視。

612
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,700
目視即係靠隻眼睇。

613
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:18,930
噉佢睇到睇唔到，噉你又點知咧？

614
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:26,720
同埋用隻眼睇好多時，講個心㗎，咁外判公佢今日同你做，聽日可能唔同你做，個心喺咪度咧？

615
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:40,950
上次其實嗰個電纜都係咁上下嘢嚟㗎咋？如果電纜有啲嘢鬆咗或者點，佢係咪真係一個你自己本本身嘅員工同埋一個幕士嘅外判工係咪有同等效果咧？

616
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:43,920
係咪？咁所以第一個問題係點解要外判啊？

617
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:45,900
個原因係咩啊？

618
01:53:48,250 --> 01:54:08,260
因為我係負責係誒車站裏邊嘅維修工作嘅，嚇噉啊，就因為大家都明白啦，車站維修工作上邊咧有相當嘅程度啦嚇。我哋需要啲比較專業嘅嘅維修商啊，幫我哋跟進啲維修工作。例如我哋車站裏邊嘅升降機啊，或者我哋嘅誒誒電扶手梯啊，誒我哋都係需要一啲比較專業嘅。

619
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:28,270
嘅嘅啊，承包商咧，幫我哋去跟進個維修噉啊，亦都有啲法例上啊，要求一啲比較更加專業，譬如話啲消防系統啊，誒裏邊我哋都需要一啲誒專業嘅嘅誒維修商啦，幫我哋跟進工作。咁呢個喺車站維修裏邊咧，係誒我哋覺得係有噉嘅需要性咧，亦都會令到我哋咧誒可以保持一個即係。

620
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:43,430
誒有效嘅嘅維修工作㗎，李生正正上我問呢個問題啊嘛，你有任何嘅檢查係專業嘅，嗰個儀器又複雜到你自己唔識用嘅，噉啊梗係外判啦。而家講緊目視喎。

621
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,830
我諗，我哋呢度每一個人都。

622
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:49,050
你畀我train幾個鐘頭，我都可以目視啦，係嘛？

623
01:54:49,670 --> 01:55:05,060
咁目視係最基本、最簡單嘅一個過程喎。你哋而家供電系統將目視由外判咗出去，而家路軌嘅檢查目視由外判咗出去，但係呢兩樣嘢完全唔涉及專業知識㗎。

624
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:08,700
咁為咩咧？老老實實係咪因為平啲啊？

625
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:14,070
好啦。

626
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:34,790
啊，或者我補充下主席，多謝你個提問。誒，我諗喺誒，其實嗱，我其實其實喺鐵路嘅運作上面咧，其實我哋由我哋七幾年通車到而家都有一啲外判嘅情況出現嘅。咁誒，其實最主要就係話誒喺我哋嘅運作上面，我哋最～

627
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:54,800
緊要一樣嘢就係喺運作上面咧，我哋達到我哋嗰個鐵路運作嘅要求係最緊要。無論係我哋內部嘅同事做好，誒，我哋外判嘅誒承辦商去做好，我哋都係同一個要求。我想強調呢一點。咁所以咧，其實喺運作上面，我哋係需要最緊要係呢樣嘢。咁至於我哋誒誒。

628
01:55:54,800 --> 01:56:04,400
有啲邊嘅工作係外判或者係與否嘅話，噉我我哋係有喺我哋個營運需要嗰度去考慮嘅，主席，多謝。對唔住，我正話唔係問。

629
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:13,530
誒外判咗之後嘅效果係點？亦都唔係問咩何冇要外判。我問問題好簡啫，啫點解要外判？係咪為咗錢？

630
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:22,710
因為呢個主席可以答你嘅問題咧，就係我哋喺營運上面嘅需要，我哋係有啲工作，我哋又去判咗。

631
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:30,490
呢個唔係好正正正答到嘅問題喎？咩叫做實際情況咧？可唔可以再瞭解下？

632
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:48,650
其實你應咗佢冇所謂㗎，噉你如果慳到啲錢，咁啲票價平啲，咁嗰樣嘢又唔係好重要嘅，噉你你你可以話你覺得唔重要嘅嘢外判，咁因為佢外判通常都應該比你自己平少少，你先外判㗎，你唔會貴啲外判㗎，係咪？

633
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,290
咁畀個真相，我哋都得㗎。

634
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:54,910
嗯。

635
01:56:55,300 --> 01:57:09,540
主席，我哋我哋只可以噉啊！我哋誒，因為前一講到我我行街啲人問我㗎，用咩準則去外判一樣嘢咧？係嗰樣嘢唔緊要咧，定係嗰樣嘢係即係誒平啲啊，慳到好多啊，噉係咪？

636
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:29,830
我諗喺市民或者乘客嘅心目中，佢哋關心嘅嘢就係鐵路運作上面，你係咪安全，係咪可以有個效率咁誒？我可以咁講，就喺運作上面，我哋有噉嘅需要，噉我哋先至會進行呢啲嘅改判嘅工作。多謝主席。啊，應該開誠布公嘅真係。O K，好啦，嗱，我哋噉啊，時間差唔多。

637
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:36,490
多啦，項目員曬唔該曬各位啊！而家個其他事項咧，我就想問下委員有冇興趣？

638
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:40,540
喺繁忙時間一齊去參觀下輕鐵。

639
01:57:40,850 --> 01:58:00,860
點樣樣逼上架車有幾多架單家車、雙家車，同埋希望都要求局長同我哋一齊去睇睇。我好耐之前都提及呢樣嘢嘅，大家有冇興趣啊？有啊嘛！好好好，阿副局長，麻煩你將我哋嘅信息帶畀阿局長，希望接受我哋邀請啦。通常咧睇呢嘢最多係七點三、七點。

640
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:02,330
半嗰段時間。

641
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:08,980
噉啊，係可能要做啲醫生，就要去遠啲地方，好嘛？希望可以安排到啦。

642
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:17,160
啊！我我同誒港鐵方面係安排一下嚇。好啊，好，唔該曬。如果冇誒其他事項，我哋今日宣佈結束。唔該。
