2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,450

咁咧就我哋而家咧就係去。

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,410
會議議程嘅第一項就下一次咧，就係討論嘅事項。

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,250
就係文件C.B.括弧一。

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,910
六零零。

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,630
斜洞一二一三括弧零一號文件就係嗰個討論事項一覽表。

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,760
係清楚。

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,140
咁咧就。

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:11,550
喺二月十五號，我就同副主席咧，亦都同運輸及房屋局局長咧，舉行咗呢個非正式會議，就商討咧係小組委員會嘅工作計劃。咁經過商議之後咧，就係嗰個工作計劃咧，即係我哋討論嘅。

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:31,810
誒事項咧，就亦都喺呢個文件係括弧零一號嗰度咧，係排列咗出嚟啦。咁咧就當局咧，亦都會咧係就著呢個係討論上一覽表咧，就會係做呢個文件嘅準備，以方便咧。

15
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:44,200
咧，我哋嘅討論亦都透過噉樣咧嚟去同政府嗰個長遠房屋策略小組咧，係佢哋討論嘅事項，大家互相係有所配合。

16
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:57,100
咁因此咧，我哋下一次會議喺三月二十號星期三咧上午八點半舉行咧，就會討論長遠房屋需求嘅初步評估，即係呢個就下一次。

17
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:07,940
咁咧就，我想詢問大家是否同意咧，就係下一次呢個討論嘅項目，同埋聽下大家有冇其他嘅建議。

18
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,290
如果冇其他建議，我哋就係照係咁安排啦。多謝各位。

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,510
咁而家我哋咧就去到以情第二。

20
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,980
今日嘅議程咧，就係社會上特定羣組嘅住屋需求。

21
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,840
咁誒有一份立法會討論文件，就係C.P.括弧一。

22
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:44,060
六零零斜洞一二一三闊湖零二號文件就係政府當局就社會上面特定羣組嘅住屋需求提供嘅文件。

23
00:02:44,470 --> 00:03:04,480
噉我歡迎咧，就係政府當局咧嘅代表出席。咁而家咧係誒請當局咧就係介紹文件，係咪柏志高先生啊？歡迎你，請你介紹啦。嗯，Mr. Chairman，In fact，we we we're here to to listen to members' views. So what I would suggest is

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:22,390
我會介紹兩篇論文，然後我們可以直接過兩篇論文。我們準備了兩篇論文，關於長遠的住房策略，審議委員會考慮的主題。第一篇是社區特定羣體的住房需求，第二篇是增加公共租賃住房資源的合理使用。

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,610
在第一篇，長遠住房策略 Steering 委員會已識別特定羣體在社區內，對其住房需求進行更密切的檢討。

26
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,690
這些係年長者、非年長者單身者、貧窮住户，包括那些住在分區單位的人。

27
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,020
youngsters and of course first-time home buyers.

28
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,840
他們已檢討了他們的住房需要和現有的方案及援助，可用來滿足他們的需要。

29
00:03:50,380 --> 00:04:00,640
given limited land and housing resources, priorities need to be set so that assistance can be provided to those with genuine and the most pressing housing needs.

30
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,020
這 must have regard to the situation faced by these different groups, since their needs do vary.

31
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:18,940
Indeed, it is also important to bear in mind the fact that certain existing policies, such as the ageing in place policy for the elderly, and the harmonious policies under the housing authority.

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,330
sorry， harmonious families policies under the housing authority are already intended to address the housing needs of certain of these groups.

33
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:40,600
Of course, there has been considerable discussion in the community on the housing needs of those living in subdivided units. However, so far, it has been difficult to ascertain the situation in this sector of the housing market.

34
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:51,750
The long-term housing strategy steering committee has commissioned an independent research institution to collect the characteristics of households living in subdivided units.

35
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,190
and they are also required to estimate the total number of subdivided units in the territory.

36
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,630
結果 of the survey should be available around mid 2013 for consideration by the steering committee.

37
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,010
在第二篇 paper， 我們 set 出現的政策， 前公共租賃屋。

38
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,330
包括《The Quotum Point System》。

39
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:27,120
Well-off tenants policies, underoccupation policies, overcrowding relief arrangements. 啊，處長，啊，處長，你停一停，因為咧，我哋按照我哋嘅議程咧，就係分開嚟討論嘅。

40
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:36,590
Okay， well， I'll come back to that one。 Sure， no problem。所以下一份文件等下個議題先，好嘛？嚇，多謝你。Sure， in which case I'll stop there， Mr. Chairman。

41
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:52,080
噉樣因此咧，就我哋而家就著誒政府文件C B股一六零零斜同一二一三嘅利用文件咧，就社會上特定羣組嘅住屋需要咧，係就呢個問題咧，我哋就

42
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:11,400
展開討論先，咁咧討論時間咧去到九點半，咁下一個環節咧就係討論嗰個充分同合理運用公共租住房屋資源措施。咁到到下一個議程嘅時候，我哋再請阿白志高先生咧係介紹，好嘛嚇？咁而家想做咧係。

43
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:27,560
社會上面特定羣組嘅住屋需要咧，就呢個議題係請大家咧係誒提出問題或者發表意見，噉就連問連答四分鐘，好嘛？嚇，咁而家我哋睇下。

44
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,710
誒而家有國家祈願，保佑命在邊一位？你哋。

45
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,130
阿胡志偉、張超雄。

46
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,340
啊，郭偉強。

47
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,760
梁志祥。

48
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,730
咁連問連答四分鐘，嚇！我哋先就呢個範疇係展開討論先，喺國家奇遇。

49
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,100
啊，主席。

50
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:58,300
嗱，我諗大家都明白咧，就係而家嗰個建屋量咧，係絕對咧係冇法子係令到大部分係等緊住公屋嘅。

51
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,090
市民咧喺一個比較合理嘅時間入邊咧，係可以獲得個房屋。

52
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:14,390
但係咧，最重要咧就喺社會上係的確有一羣咧係好需要係我哋特別去去處理同埋關注嘅，即係話你講嗰個。

53
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,070
文件廁嗰度居住環境惡劣嘅住户。

54
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:39,880
嗱，大家都知道咧，而家政府個統計咧就相當啲唔準確嘅。統計處嗰個調查個水準咧，亦都喺做一兩個月之前咧報章亦都揭示咗咧，佢係嗰個誒統計員個質素啊，或者佢個統計方法會有問題。你基於呢一個做法咧，就都計到咧。

55
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,530
係有唔少個六萬四千九百人咧，係可以住呢啲噉嘅房。

56
00:07:45,860 --> 00:08:05,870
即係總共有大概唔少於三萬一千八百個啦。首先呢一啲咧，基本上就未必準確嘅，因為有一啲其他嘅非政府組組織亦都係估計咧，香港有超過唔少過二十萬人咧，係住喺呢啲噉嘅房屋入邊。咁個户數咧係可能咧係達到六萬或者。

57
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,320
九萬嗰個數，咁當然呢個我哋冇法子去證實。

58
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:29,630
咁但係政府基於呢一啲噉嘅評估而去做出嚟嗰個房屋嗰個需求咧，我就算當你而家嚇，即係你話又要照顧長者，又要照顧而家嗰啲已經輪候冊入邊，你而家七萬九個單位咧，就算你加到將來唯有十萬，即係一八年。

59
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,320
之後咧，二零一八年之後咧，就有十萬個咧，其實都冇法子係解決到。

60
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:44,310
但我最重要咧，就係想問下房委會又好，或者政府又好，點樣可以能夠係盡一個方法？

61
00:08:44,820 --> 00:09:04,830
除咗係準確地評估呢一梯呢一啲環境特別惡劣嘅人，包括係喺啲工業大廈劏房嗰啲，同埋有啲咩係特事特辦係幫佢哋，因為佢哋事實上係最慘嗰啲嚟。我唔知阿柏志高先生或者你啲同事有冇去過呢啲噉。

62
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,750
咪通風。

63
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,560
嚇！即係嗰種環境咧，喺我哋作為香港亞洲國際城市，我哋講係羞恥，亦都係政府嘅羞恥嚟。

64
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,430
因為我哋係有二萬六千億嘅資源，唔係冇錢。

65
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,630
你話地唔夠，呢個政府咁多年來嘅失職係令到個地唔夠。無論你前一任呢一任，我唔知你邊個要負責。

66
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:33,770
但係要等要依數以萬計嘅人係逼喺呢一啲日日係會火燭或者甚至有意外嘅地方嗰度。

67
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,170
政府再交呢啲噉嘅數字。

68
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,070
點會令到我哋收貨？好啊，阿白兆先生，請你答啦嚇。

69
00:09:43,540 --> 00:10:00,820
Mr. Chairman, yes, indeed. Not only have we been to these subdivided, an example. Let me say we haven't been to all of them, an example of subdivided flats. The Secretary for Transport and Housing has personally visited them as well. So we are aware that there's a whole range.

70
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,220
of subdivided units, some of them are frankly quite acceptable, some of them are frankly not acceptable.

71
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,010
The issue here is that we need to get up a definition for what we're trying to talk about.

72
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:34,370
The figures that we set out in paragraph 13 of the paper are derived from actual information gathered during the census and the biennial censuses. They are as a result of visits to those people. They can be determined specifically. That's why you can determine when you have cockloft.

73
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,050
bed spaces, cubicles, there are definitions within the system.

74
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:47,880
Unfortunately for subdivided units at the present time, there isn't an agreed definition, and that's one of the issues that we think is very important. You have to define the problem.

75
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:57,690
hence we're going to we have already commissioned an outside agency to come up with investigations of the situation.

76
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,700
come up with a definition and on the basis of that definition derive the numbers. So that's the starting point.

77
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:21,370
In terms of your second question, which relates to the provision of housing, at the moment，係個問題又唔夠時間答啦。哦，OK，我 come back to that。嗯，所以大家希望大家都增加四分鐘連問連答。噉啊，你排第二次啦，個個議員好嘛？嚇。

78
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,920
噉我你你舉手我先寫落去啊！你如果唔夠獎，你排第二次，胡志偉議員。

79
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,960
第二，多謝主席。

80
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,980
呢一份文件咧，就講到係一啲有特別需要嘅係特定羣組。

81
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:55,270
咁但係其實時間討論都係好緊張嘅，我想睇一睇咧，就係第一嗰個居住環境惡劣嘅住户咧，其實誒部門或者係政府咧，有冇一啲資料就係其實有幾多人係咪輪候緊呢個公共房屋？佢哋輪候嘅情況喺你哋資料上邊咧？

82
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,840
係有冇可能係反映得到出嚟嘅？

83
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:18,130
咁同埋就係即係誒，因為我記得幾次咧講到呢一類嘅房間嘅時間咧，其實政府都有提過，就係即係佢都有佢自己嘅一個係即係存在嘅價值嘅。噉，但我都記得就係話咧，喺七十年代當香港好多廉屋嘅時候咧，其實政府都係定立咗一個。

84
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:38,140
基本嘅係目標就係覺得長期長遠嚟講咧，就要係即係將呢一個嘅係廉屋咧係取消取替噉樣，似咧有個十年建屋計劃啊，然後就慢慢點樣樣係將呢個係人口凍結啊，諸如處女噉嘅嘢。我想問下就係話，其實即係政府有冇一個好？

85
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,160
好清楚嘅係，即係決心話畀到大家聽，就係咧。

86
00:12:42,440 --> 00:13:02,450
我哋對於而家呢一啲叫做係唔合符資格，或者叫唔合符安全標準，我諗最基最低要求係呢樣嘢啦。唔合符安全標準嘅係誒居住環境惡劣嘅單位，你有冇基本嘅資料掌握？同埋會唔會話到畀公眾聽？你哋係會有一個計劃係。

87
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:08,730
將呢啲唔合符標準嘅係即係誒居住環境惡劣嘅單位咧，係予以。

88
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,150
寓意係即係誒。

89
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:29,490
有個計劃咧，係令到佢唔可以喺呢個社會上邊咧，係一定要改善到合乎資格，同埋就係話咧有雙入嘅房屋政策咧，係令到居住喺而家呢啲單位裏邊嘅係住户咧，係有一個嘅住房嘅安排。係阿白主張。Thank you。

90
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,270
as as I've indicated.

91
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,180
the the current stage is first of all let's define the problem, and that's where we're at.

92
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:46,370
In terms of the people on the waiting list, we don't have the level of detail until we do the actual interviews.

93
00:13:46,650 --> 00:14:06,660
as to their entitlement and as to their existing accommodation, we do know that there are people that already live, for example, in public rental housing who are on the waiting list because they want to separate their families or what have you. So there's a whole range of different people on the waiting list. It's not just people in subdivided units; it's people living in

94
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:26,670
在，作為PRH，就是住喺閣樓、牀鋪式公寓，所有呢啲嘢，係一整套嘅嘢。我們喺面試嘅時候決定佢哋嘅資格，通常係喺兩年半到三年嘅時候，資格就開始生效。而家喺等緊名單嘅人，平均嘅資格係幾多？

95
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:34,680
waiting time for their first offer is about two point seven years, something like that. Of course, there are people that stay longer than that.

96
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,140
所以。

97
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:48,920
The other question is what is government's policy? Well, government's policy is to provide accommodation for those people who are unable to provide accommodation for themselves, either rental or purchase.

98
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:59,200
We don't break it down beyond that at this stage, because frankly, if you're in need of accommodation, why would we discriminate against any particular need?

99
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:11,320
我們 take the view that if you have a need, it will be determined against our entitlements, the income and asset limits and so on and so forth, and that's the criteria that we apply. 主席唔好意思，因為我我諗誒。

100
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,950
我聽完之後，其實我好失望嘅，因為咧。

101
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:26,670
誒，大家都有好多討論咧，就覺得而家居住喺劏房、板間房居住環境惡劣嘅係住户咧，事實上係需要咧，係我哋有一個即係特殊嘅係即係。

102
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:47,200
安排或者諗法，令到就話咧呢啲住户咧係可以離開呢一個環境啊嘛。咁問題就係話，如果只係將佢擺成就話同一般嘅輪候隊伍一一致嘅話，咁呢一個你就唔能夠有發揮到係要照顧或者要考慮到係特殊需要嘅羣組佢哋嗰個嘅係解決佢嘅生活困難嘅。

103
00:15:47,200 --> 00:16:07,210
做法咯。Mr Chairman，hang on，there are people on the waiting list who have equally bad accommodation. I would suggest that people in bed space apartments their accommodation is probably worse. The problem is everybody on the on the waiting list should be assessed against their absolute need. That's the determinant. The point about the discussion today is that the long term housing

104
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:24,800
策略會 be considering these issues and advising government on the way forward in the future as to what the priorities should be. I don't think it's reasonable to say that there's one category that must be given the absolute priority when there are so many categories that also need consideration, and that's where we're coming from.

105
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,350
下誒下一位啦，張志雄議員。

106
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,820
多謝主席。

107
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,710
即係聽到處長咁講咧，我又覺得即係。

108
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:41,730
唔多唔少係種狡辯嚟嘅，即係我哋有唔同嘅需要，但係我哋都係因應住。

109
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,570
誒政府最中意講啦，資源有限，我哋一定要即係有優次啊嘛！

110
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,530
咁好啦，頭先處長話誒，今年年中會即係發表嗰個有個報告啊，劏房個調查。

111
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,790
但係你調查咗有幾多劏房户，或者有幾多人，噉啊點咧？

112
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,420
即係而家，我哋唔係唔知道嘅問題。

113
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:15,610
你話我哋唔知道誒有幾多人，或者嗰啲户噉，但係都有民間有好多調查啦，譬如話工商專業聯會委託廣大精算係咧。

114
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:25,850
佢哋都計過，大概有二十萬嘅人咧，係住喺啲困難嘅環境惡劣嘅即係居所。

115
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,810
近十五萬人咧，係住喺呢啲劏房。

116
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,740
有個全港嘅關注劏房平台。

117
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,240
就佢哋巡咗四千幾個單位咧。

118
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,600
佢估計有成廿八萬户住喺呢啲噉嘅環境惡劣嘅環境添。

119
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,480
噉我想問，究竟而家處方？

120
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,420
做咗個調查。

121
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,600
有咩措施？有咩政策去幫佢哋咧？

122
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:59,030
而家呢啲喺居住環境即係惡劣嘅住户，仲要等幾耐咧？

123
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,880
同埋，而家面臨。

124
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,450
政府亦都不斷喺度誒。

125
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,920
即係睇翻呢啲衞生環境咧，有部分咧會受到清拆嘅。

126
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,800
主席，我係知道咧，受清拆户咧。

127
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:25,760
佢哋並唔會得到咩優先。如果佢符合上樓嘅資格咧，佢頂籠就係去咗個中轉屋；如果唔係咧，就就咁叫佢走啦。

128
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,550
我覺得呢個亦都係不近人情。

129
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,970
我亦都想問，即係處方咧，會唔會？

130
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:52,260
如果遭受清拆嘅呢啲劏房或者環境惡劣嘅呢啲住户咧，佢係咪應該有一個優先被安配安配呢個公屋，而唔係去中轉屋？啊，柏智偉先生。Government policy is that if action by a government department results in someone being

131
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,350
ended on.

132
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,700
without accommodation.

133
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:16,990
Then they will be offered accommodation in interim housing as a first stage. We then assess their entitlement for public housing or what have you. Bear in mind that that first stage, they do. There are certain requirements. For example, if it's an emergency housing accommodation at short term, they get three months rent free. During that period, we do the assessments and so on.

134
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:28,600
所以，所有那些政策都已經在位，我可告訴你，我們與建築署密切合作，處理任何的清拆行動，確保市民得到妥善安置。

135
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:48,960
You know, there's no way for me to ignore the fact that there is a limited number of units available, and clearly we have to give priority to those people most in need. That's the way the policy works. What we're trying to do now is to determine the size of the the problem, and I've said this now three times. But the reality is, I get all sorts of claims about the numbers.

136
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,270
200,000,60,000,26,000，I don't know，unless I have the confidence of

137
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:16,560
Determining through a proper survey conducted under our auspices what the size of the problem is, and I agree with you. We must determine the size of the problem first before we take views as to where to go forward. But in terms of the rehousing for those people affected by clearance, that's already in place.嗱，如果既然我哋都知道嘅問題。

138
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:36,570
嚴重，我當然同意係要知道而家有幾多人啦。不過老實講，呢啲嘅居住環境係不斷變化緊，我哋不斷見到咧，仍然有人做緊劏房，所以個數字咧命永遠冇話係一個實數嘅。我咧，我諗我個問題就係話，你而家明知個問題嚴重。

139
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:50,320
而家有冇啲諗法去處理呢個問題，而唔係話等到我哋調查咗有一個數字，你先去諗嘢㗎嘛？阿張元，時間夠你唔答你唔到你下一輪啦，我冇辦法嚇。

140
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,270
啊，郭偉強議員。

141
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,370
係啊！對。

142
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,410
喂喂，係，多謝主席。

143
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:07,250
就住咧誒成個文件嘅內容咧，其實可以睇到一個好清晰嘅位置咧，就係政府咧將青年人。

144
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,630
個住屋需要咧，係擺到最尾。

145
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:24,130
就住咧，誒睇翻嗰個計分制咧，其實誒關於個非長者單身人士嘅分計分制咧，某程度上就係將青年人個住屋需要咧壓後。

146
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,060
佢哋嘅配屋嘅時間咧，分分鐘咧可以好長。

147
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:40,760
因為咧喺成份文件裏邊，政府就話會加入計分制，但係從來都冇提過整體會增加幾多單人嘅住屋單位。

148
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:57,420
但係呢個問題咧，唔單止影響青年人，就連啊受庫户影響、就庫户政策影響嘅一啲長者、單身人士咧，都係增加咗個單人單位嘅住屋需要。究竟處方局方？

149
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,750
就住呢啲單人單位嘅興建量，會唔會有調整？

150
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,600
從而咧，去解決大量嘅單身人士嘅住屋需要。

151
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:27,130
多謝主席。主席，Mr. Chairman, in fact, we on an annual basis we review the mix of flats that we build to take into account the overall situation, both on the general waiting list, which is for families, as well as the QPS waiting list for singletons, and we do revise.

152
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:47,140
the the mix between one p two p flats and two bedroom three bedroom flats at the moment for the last few years we've actually been producing more smaller units because there has been a general trend towards smaller family sizes in Hong Kong so we do monitor that very closely indeed at the moment in terms of the

153
00:22:47,140 --> 00:23:07,150
actual allocation available for QPS waiting list people, as you know there is not a fixed timetable for those, but we do try to produce around 2,000 units per annum for those people on the waiting list. It's roughly that. It varies slightly every year. In terms of the elderly single.

154
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:21,100
The elderly are taken as a separate category again, and in that case, we do try to keep to a two-year waiting list time before they're offered their first offer. At the moment, we're achieving about 1.4, I think.

155
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:32,290
yeah for overall elderly about 1.1.4 years waiting time, so there are different criterion within the overall criterion of the waiting lists.

156
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:51,630
阿郭偉強議，係多謝主席。我要追問嘅，因為咧，剛才啊局長咧、啊副局長咧就講到嗰個量，但係咧就冇講實際數字嘅。究竟會喺幾多單人嘅公屋單位咧？因為淨係非長者咧都有成九萬人等緊啊！睇翻份文件，九萬人等緊。

157
00:23:51,950 --> 00:24:11,960
你個量唔滿足到嘅話，呢九萬人要等幾耐？你唔好成日同我講平均嘅上樓數字，因為平均咧兩年幾呃人嘅。我哋見嘅個案咧，起碼四五年以上。而呢班非長者嘅單身人士咧，佢哋實際等嘅年期一定比呢個平均數長好。

158
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:31,970
好多究竟個量有幾多？阿秘書長，你有冇可以回應？Um, sorry, Mr. Chairman, I don't have those figures of 90,000. Certainly not. As terms in terms of the elderly singletons, the number is much smaller. But I can say that that certainly our figures show that at the moment, waiting time for the first offer is about 1.4 years.

159
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:52,130
Of course, we can't force people to take their first offer. They have up to three offers. It's their choices to whether they accept the first offer or they choose to accept the subsequent offers. And indeed, one of the issues that I think people must be aware of: we also have priority.

160
00:24:52,130 --> 00:25:12,140
for people to choose districts, and at the moment it's difficult for us because most of the units that are coming on stream, the new units, are in the urban or extended urban area, and that has meant that there's a there seems to be a lot of people that are shifting their previous choice from the NT into these.

161
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:24,000
extended urban and urban areas, so that we're always juggling the the allocation and numbers. But at the moment, as I said, the the allocation time for the first offer is about 1.4 years.

162
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,670
接住係梁志祥議員，係，多謝主席。噉就嗯。

163
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:49,960
關於咧，即係住喺居住環境惡劣嘅地方嘅人士嘅一啲即係房屋嘅安排，或者係一啲叫支援咧。其實誒，我覺得咧，除咗喺呢一個劏房、板間房呢一類型之外咧，其實喺鄉郊地區咧，同樣有一批咧，即係。

164
00:25:49,960 --> 00:26:09,970
住喺一啲寮屋入邊啊，而呢啲寮屋咧係好簡陋，亦都因為過去嘅歷史入邊咧，就政府喺寮屋嘅興建咧，你做開嘅一啲叫物料啊，都係通常係用鐵皮或者係係木嘅嚟做咧，佢就唔可以再改建或者加固嘅。所以呢一類型嘅誒住屋咧。

165
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:29,980
嘅環境都係好差，不過咧，同樣咧，佢哋要申請上樓咧，係係經過一個好漫長嘅時間。咁所以，我覺得即係喺呢個誒支援方面咧，我覺得你哋都要考慮埋呢一類，因為我即係當然啦，喺喺可能現時大家比較關心到呢一類誒㗱房或者係板。

166
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,950
㞨房呢一類啦，咁但係往往忽略咗呢一個所謂居住環境差嘅呢部分。

167
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:55,240
咁而我想問嘅咧，就係話而家咧特別喺你文件入邊提到咧，九至十五段入邊咧，提到關愛基金所謂先導項目啊。呢啲先導項目咧，就係幫一啲目前即係幫一啲長者咧，係一次過交呢一個誒，即係租金津貼，即係幫佢哋喺住喺私人樓入邊咧。

168
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,560
係。

169
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,550
交租係昂貴嘅情況，幫下佢哋手噉，但係點解又冇考慮到咧？即係幫一啲咧。

170
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:09,000
誒而家都係住喺私人樓，頭先我講到嘅板間房、劏房，其實個租金都唔平嘅。

171
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:29,290
咁好過而家咧，我講緊嗰啲就話咧，誒排隊又排唔到上樓，而又住喺私人樓嘅租金貴嘅地方。咁呢一類咧，無論佢係長者或者家庭咧，點解即係政府冇考慮到咧？誒，實際你又安排唔到人上樓啦。噉你你唯有就係咪用關愛基金，同樣可以用一個所？

172
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:34,760
先導計劃咧，嚟幫佢哋一啲租金嘅津貼咧，咁喺呢方面有冇考慮過咧？

173
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,150
啊！必須真。嗯。

174
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:58,200
Mr. Chairman, I certainly agree with the honourable member. We cannot just focus on one specific group. We have to have regard to all the need in the community. As I answered to the earlier question, certainly subdivided flats are a particular problem, but there are many other problem areas. And we do try to be absolutely fair. The only criterion.

175
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:09,710
really, as far as we're concerned, the determinant is their income and asset limit. Whether their entire the circumstances beyond that are poor or otherwise.

176
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:19,880
those are given, we don't we don't question that. we take their income and asset limit as the determinant. I think that's the only fair way in a community which has so many diverse needs.

177
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,110
In terms of the people that have

178
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,240
needs other than you know being on the waiting list, you know.

179
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,910
Can we provide other assistance?

180
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:50,590
There are, in addition to the community care fund, which which I understand has a number of support measures available for people who would otherwise not qualify. Of course, there are support measures through the CSSA.

181
00:28:50,870 --> 00:29:06,980
for those people who qualify, and I'm sure that the community care fund will be looking at at ways to further enhance their support as it goes forward. And indeed, one of the things that I think will happen once we have determined

182
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:27,270
The situation in respect of subdivided units, for example, we will share that information with the Commission on Poverty and help them also to get into what further support will be needed. But as I say, that's I think something that's slightly outside the context of the housing needs as we're looking at it in terms of the long-term housing strategy.

183
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,310
啊，秘書長。

184
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,870
我希望你哋嘅調查咧，就關注到喺呢個。

185
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,480
誒新界裏邊咧，有啲咧係住喺嗰啲貨櫃裏面添。

186
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:56,600
啊！啲貨櫃改建咁正史料嘅梁志仁議員，嗰啲貨櫃似乎外表咧就係好似好堅固，但係環境係十分之惡劣啊！所以你哋嘅調查咧，希望都關心到呢啲方面，好嘛？咁繼續咧係李長議員。

187
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:07,030
誒，希望大家都留意咧。我哋而家連問連答係四分鐘，跟住第二輪都有好多位嚇。咁因為我哋今日嘅討論時間呢一個問題咧。

188
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,170
會去到九點半嚇。

189
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:19,180
誒李翔議員，噉啊！主席真係都冇乜嘢好討論，因為即係我覺得個長遠策略委員會而家變成一個束手無策委員會。

190
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,610
噉啊！你所有講嗰啲問題咧，全部我睇唔到有一個答案。

191
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:31,930
嚇，全部都拖。你講劏房，佢就話做調查，冇數目，又唔知點做。但係其實就算你有數目，

192
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,450
有咩策略啫？

193
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:53,750
有咩板斧先得㗎？你誒最緊要嘅板斧當然就係增建公屋。咁但係你嗰度又死咗啦嚇，五年裏邊最多七萬五千加少少加三千九，噉啊最多係噉。噉你又冇板斧提供多啲供應嘅話咧，你都冇辦法。噉我提。

194
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:13,760
之前提過市建局會唔會做即係起埋公屋？咁如果你話市建局起埋公屋，咁起碼我多個板斧，話即係啊市建局可以起公屋，同埋市建局收咗啲誒舊嘅大廈嗰陣時咧，會唔會有啲簡單嘅裝修就已經可以中轉一啲嘅年青人去嗰度？

195
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,290
住住先，起碼即係嗰個供應係增加，又做唔做到咧？即係有咩板斧，我想問。

196
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:40,950
嚇，然後你講到年青人置業嗰度咧，其實個數字有一個數字好得人驚咧，就話即係一個年青人咧，一個即係中位數嘅年青人，佢而家如果想買一個三十平方米嘅樓咧，個按揭以前咧係卅幾個percent，而家去到六啊五嘅percent啦，比起即係。

197
00:31:40,950 --> 00:32:00,960
誒，我記憶之中好似講係九六年嘅，咁所以咧變咗係即係升到噉樣樣，下個按揭比例去到即係六廿五嘅percent，根本你亦都明知佢買唔到。咁人你話居屋咁又梗咗局，係即係啊，二零一六一七先至有五千個單位，即係你有咩辦？

198
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:20,970
反苦，我想問嚇租金津貼，當然我哋提咗嚇噉，但係我哋亦都提話租金管制，你又唔肯做。對於啲劏房户唔使挨貴租嚇，唔使問，即係就算有劏租金津貼啊管制，都係挨貴租。不過起碼唔好咁離譜咁解，應該咁講嚇。你又唔做噉，所以我真係問。

199
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:40,980
所有你我哋提啲問題，或者今日想投討論嘅特定羣組，我哋睇唔到你有任何嘅答案。可唔可以畀到一啲嘅策略？我哋真係可以解決到頭先我哋講嗰啲問題。你全部啊都好似冇新嘅板斧，咁起碼我頭先問史建嗰個板斧得唔得咧？嚇！

200
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,830
啊，嗰啊，排長會長。

201
00:32:45,210 --> 00:33:05,220
Well, of course, the whole point is in the title. It is the long-term housing strategy steering committee. It's looking at long-term solutions, not immediate solutions. Immediate solutions must come from the government, and in that respect, we are putting a lot of effort into speeding up the production of of housing units. You know, we've already indicated that.

202
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:25,230
We're increasing the first five-year supply up to 79,000. The chief executive announced the decision to increase the second five-year up to 100,000 over that five-year period. We're speeding up the production of units as as much as we can. We're looking at new ways to, for example, is it possible to convert industrial buildings

203
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,500
into residential accommodation. In fact, housing authority is is is doing it itself.

204
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:42,540
The role of the URA, of course, is slightly different. The purpose of the URA is to facilitate the redevelopment of rundown urban areas, and how they determine the

205
00:33:42,930 --> 00:34:02,940
The way forward depends on how they've secured the properties which they've secured for that purpose of redevelopment. I can't speak for the URA, but I can say that they have done some renovation projects and they have done redevelopment projects in conjunction with both the housing society and private developers. So they have a whole

206
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:17,440
但係，佢哋嘅 task 是 not the same as the housing authority. It is the housing authority's responsibility to provide public rental housing and now the home ownership scheme. And I can assure you that we're moving fast on both of those fronts, both HOS and PRH.

207
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:37,730
即係主席，其實即係等於即係乜嘢嘢都話係長遠解決噉，即係都即係而家所有啲水深火熱嘅居民都即係大家去望望梅止渴，咁不如叫咗一個望梅止渴嘅委員會，根本完全係即係唔係有任何嘅措施攞到出嚟。

208
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:57,740
係去真係解決問題，所以我諗主席，我哋依個委員會都有個問題嘅，就係同佢玩長遠根本冇得玩嘅，根本冇嘢可以做到。噉我真係好希望時間咧就，但係真係非常之失望。誒，就你質疑咧，我哋呢個委員會咧，我就必須係要去講講嘅。我哋呢個委員會咧。

209
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:17,750
就係因應我哋議員提出要求咧，就係誒監督，亦都係配合，就係政府個長遠房屋策略小組，即係嗰個係政府成立。我哋立法會呢個長遠房屋策略嘅委員會小組委員會咧，就係為咗監督同埋配合，所以今。

210
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,680
今日嘅討論咧，就係講到社會特定羣組呢一個議程，就唔係為咗咧係。

211
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:44,450
即刻係有答案嘅，正因為我哋未有答案，所以咧我哋就要跟進討論，嚟去監督政府個討論。我哋個功能就我明白，完全明白個功能，即係只不過意思咧，我哋監督政府，但係政府冇料到嗰時，我哋督極佢都督唔到咁解啫。所以你繼續督咯，係咯，但係真係真係督到我而家啲手。

212
00:35:44,450 --> 00:36:04,460
手軟都係，你手軟你加力啦，好嘛？所以我哋呢一個咧就並不是你講嘅無料委員會嚇。咁而家咧，我話佢嗰個啊，我話佢嗰個係無料委員會，望梅止渴委員會係佢嚇。得，噉你澄清係最好。噉我哋而家係兩國議員，希望大家都把握時間四分。

213
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,620
用連問連答。誒，阿梁院。誒，主席好簡單啫。嗱，如果你想揾嗰啲誒。

214
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,020
苦煮咧，通常嘅方法咧，即係我細個住個木屋嘅，我我點解會住公屋？因為我細個住木屋嘅。

215
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:30,190
係嘛？噉佢就同你登記㗎嘛，即係誒，你係間寮屋咁登記咗之後咧，你就喺個名冊裏邊啊，跟住佢慢慢噉樣將你遷咗去。

216
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:37,260
公屋裏邊噉啊，徙置區嚟。阿梁姨，你個手提電話，你去一個靜音啦，好嘛？嗱。

217
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:47,010
而家如果你係咁做嘅話，你一定係係會攞到嗰個準確嘅數目啦，係咪？你哋唔係噉樣做啊嘛？地價税宣佈啊，你話。

218
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,280
喂！如果你住劏房，我有。

219
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,960
由做盡。

220
00:36:51,240 --> 00:37:05,440
即刻話畀你聽啦！嗰陣時就唔係都話係啦，嗰陣時另一個問題就即刻要隔住啫，因為你哋冇對應嘅一個誘因，係畀啲人去報畀你聽啊嘛！而家費事報啦，話畀你聽，得個籌帳兩個字。

221
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,330
你一定要諗呢個方法㗎啦！

222
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,530
係咪？你你做一個全港嘅。

223
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:25,250
無論係好似梁志祥講嗰啲誒廉屋嘅交鄉郊廉屋嘅，你劃咗之後係有有機會改善佢生活或者有補貼嘅，咪得咯。但係你又唔實行呢個租管，因為租管係。

224
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:40,540
去控制你呢個租租津或者租緩嘅成本嘅一個好重要嘅手段嚟㗎嘛，亦都係令到個租金唔會上漲，唔會產生尋租活動引起嘅樓價上漲同埋地價上漲。

225
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,910
你唔做啊嘛！

226
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,620
張權想。

227
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,220
啱啱上台嘅時候，我掟佢，啲人話：，喂，個長毛黐線嘅喎！

228
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,830
係咪？我都話咗你做咗個不步之後係後患無窮。我我最近翻去睇翻我我啲發言。

229
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,790
神咁準。

230
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,560
仲有一個問題就係本會嘅嘅會員都睇唔到，你嗰啲銀行啊，嗰啲金融。

231
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,210
同埋呢個地產股，亦都係呢一個，即係其實。

232
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:31,540
你哋要維持呢個政策係因為金融同埋地產嘅霸權啊嘛！你今日你唔指出嗰個問題，你唔能夠叫香港人睇到，就好似其他嗰啲保皇派議員話我掛掛住間公屋造成公屋冇位，即係戇居嘅，係咪啊？就係因為呢個啊嘛！如果你係

233
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:42,560
真有你有正視嘅領導有leader説過，你一定係噉樣講㗎啦。你一定有相應嘅嘅嘅誒措施。好，即今日嘅曾俊華嚟啦，唔通佢話要租管，我就要反對佢掟個招咩？

234
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:58,530
係嘛？你會唔會畀時間畀阿柏生？唔係我我噉樣嗱，阿阿黃國健議員，你話長遠，我就指出長遠就應該噉樣做。你一定有辣椒㗎嘛？你講嚟講去話唔畀人哋買樓，買樓要收商會，上乜用啊？你租管咪攞佢命咯？

235
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,970
或者你同一啲人講。

236
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,700
如果你肯做細嘅生意，我畀你做。

237
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,610
你同佢簽約啊嘛！

238
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:14,720
你嗰啲旅館啊，呢個李嘉誠啊，係做旅館又拎拎去賣畀人做，你又冇冇招？

239
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:21,240
噉你不如有一啲房係想佢真係想做啲嘢嘅，你咪不如真畀佢做咯，又唔係。

240
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:29,000
係咪成日講話？係睇下工廠有冇有冇再改？嗰啲梁振英真係講大話都唔使本。

241
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:42,610
你唔係你個政策唔改，我覺得真係我冇冇搞。因為你你成日都係講嚟講去就話誒年青人又話重要啲誒長者又重要啲長者啊幾慘你知唔知啊？住唔到你間公屋啊！

242
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,470
百年歸老之後，喺陰間住呢間公屋都住唔到啊！

243
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,060
個骨灰庵啊！大我我我我大把case揾唔到骨灰庵。

244
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,210
住呢間陰間公屋都唔得啊！

245
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,170
而家陰間㗱房都好貴啊！唔好意思啊～

246
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,920
出招啦，租管啦。

247
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:17,200
賣賣多啲地起平樓，賣整多啲公屋，佢咪自然個不保任咯。呢個時間到啦，你冇計劃，冇意思啦。誒，而家接住係副主席謝偉全先生。

248
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,270
啊，富傑。

249
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,110
多謝，多謝主席。

250
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:35,400
就誒當然啦！我哋今日就即係我哋會就長遠嘅房屋策略嘅小組林耀忠。噉啊就誒我相信誒秘書長咧，即係除咗睇長遠，即係短期。

251
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,540
誒有急切需要嘅，我相信都係喺另外場，佢都會考慮同埋會會做啦。我相信。咁至於制定嗰個，

252
00:40:42,820 --> 00:41:02,830
誒長遠嗰個房屋策略咧，就分個羣組方面咧，我基本上就冇乜大嘅意見。咁但係我唔知道咧，係咪即係分咗羣組之後，而家其實即係政府已經掌握曬即係唔同羣組佢嘅數字同埋嗰啲收入分配啊，同埋即係有。

253
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:22,840
冇一啲估算咧，即係未來五年、十年、十五年嘅情況係點咧？因為你呢啲數字咧，對你制定嗰個長遠嘅房屋策略咧，我相信係一定要需要嘅。噉我都希望咧，即係呢，如果啲數字有咧，你定期咧就會檢視下，因為呢個社會方面咧就不斷變化。噉啊～

254
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:31,220
啊，起屋嚟講咧，需要時間。噉你如果唔預早掌握，或者啲估算評估咧，即係你始終咧就係誒錯配嘅，有機會。

255
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,190
咁另外第二個問題咧，我係想講講咧，即係話。

256
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:55,570
因為而家嗰個房屋需求咧，同可能誒之前咧都有個變化一段時間。早期嘅政嘅策略噉啊，幾個最主要嘅一個房屋方面供應咧，包括房委、誒房協，或者而家市區重建局，甚至私人發展商。

257
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,260
喺呢方面咧，就我唔知，即係佢哋扮演嘅角色咧。

258
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:14,070
誒呢個誒而家定咗嗰個長遠房屋策略嗰個委員會咧，即係會唔會去研究一下？尤其是我想問下誒，備上咧關於嗰個房協啊。

259
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:34,360
佢扮演嘅角色係乜嘢咧？嚇，佢係咪即係有個角色畀佢喺呢個誒？譬如係誒幫助啊呢個住屋嘅問題咧？我見到裏邊咧有講過係嗰啲長者嘅啫，淨係提過啊。唔該，主席係啊，帕茲先生。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, absolutely.

260
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,790
我 take the point on statistics, and indeed that's one of the things that

261
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:58,120
We must provide the information to allow informed decisions to be made on the way ahead. Not only that, but we've got to update the figures on a regular basis. So, whatever the outcome of the review, I would expect there to be a need for a regular review of the of the recommendations, so that we can update the information and adjust the recommend.

262
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:12,750
as appropriate. So I agree with you entirely on that. We will we will do that. In terms of the Hong Kong Housing Society, they do currently operate a number of rental housing estates.

263
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:28,510
They have two classes, Class A and Class B. Class B is slightly more higher income and asset limits. They have also operated, produced rather, units for sale. Greenview Villa is an example of that recently.

264
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:48,800
They are also looking at areas particularly suited for, I guess you'd call them middle class elderly. These are their sen projects, which are designed to provide not just accommodation but also a whole range of support services suitable for the needs of the elderly. So the housing society has a

265
00:43:48,800 --> 00:44:08,810
Quite a diverse portfolio of existing properties, as well as areas that they're trialling. Sometimes at the request of government, sometimes on their own initiative. And we will certainly continue to involve the housing society as we go forward, because I think they're one of the opportunities.

266
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:22,900
是重開發部分他們的舊屋，就正如房屋署正在看重開發舊屋，我認為我們應該也看重開發他們的舊屋，所以房屋協會也正在這個背景下被看。

267
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:44,190
阿梁家傑議員，多謝主席。主席，我哋呢一個誒小組委員會咧，其實就應該係同呢個長遠房屋策略督導委員會咧係並排而行㗎。咁事實上個文件交嚟咧，亦都話會將我哋嘅意見轉達督導委員會作進一步考慮嘅。噉我就。

268
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:57,340
就想一間問下啊啊啊處長咧，即係其實誒就住兩點咧，因為始終得四分鐘咧，我一間會提兩點咧，我想睇下睇下呢個督導委員會其實討論咗未？

269
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,110
嗱，第一咧就係你關於呢個特定羣組咧，叫做誒長者啦。

270
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:10,140
咁其實而家嗰個公屋嗰個庫户政策，加埋嗰個寬躺户政策咧。

271
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,070
其實好多時咧，你就係逼嗰啲。

272
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,910
年輕人咧，即係有經濟能力嗰啲人咧，就搬出嘅。

273
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,690
咁咧就。

274
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:42,320
呢個咧，我可以直接講，我覺得係呢個拆散家庭嘅安排嚟啦嚇。咁譬如呢一個有冇考慮過會有多啲彈性嚇，令到咧，譬如你鼓勵長者居家安老，佢又可以同啲後生嘅就住埋一齊啦，就唔使因為佢譬如有個。

275
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:49,310
大學畢業生噉樣，噉佢揾到份好啲嘅工，收入高啲咧，佢就即係要搬出噉樣。

276
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,660
第二個咧就係關於嗰個誒。

277
00:45:53,100 --> 00:46:04,070
誒居屋啊，即係新建居屋定價，咁呢個咧就係你最後嗰羣組啦。首次置業提供嗰個援助嗰度啦。

278
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:18,500
因為譬如綠油雅苑咧，即係佢定價咧賣到咧，即係六七千蚊一尺噉樣。咁但係佢如果建築成本咧，其實就講緊二三千蚊啊噉樣嘅啫，有免地價嘅噉。

279
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:38,790
咁其實你係咪一定要同個市值即係市價掛鈎咧？譬如你而家起啲新嘅居屋咧，即係個定價係咪都係要同市值攞個百分比咧？即係呢兩個問題，我唔知道，即係你嘅督導委員會講過未，同埋即係有冇一啲傾向性嘅誒？

280
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:58,800
可以同我哋交代一下，多謝主席。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll ask Agnes to answer the second part of the question, but on the first part, the the policies to allow for younger family members to live nearby or look after their elderly parents, they are in place. But of course.

281
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:09,020
The dilemma you're always going to have is the entitlement of the younger family members, because generally the older family members will qualify because their their incomes will be lower, but

282
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:30,100
因為我們有收入和資產限制， younger family members as they their economic situation advances, they do unfortunately fall outside the limits, and that's the dilemma. Do we try to encourage them to to move out, perhaps into home ownership schemes, thereby releasing units that we can allocate to other people, or

283
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,490
或，我們 going to be a little bit more accommodating。

284
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:43,050
It is a balance. It's something that we need to look at, and and I can assure you we will be looking at that. But that I'm afraid is a very difficult area you've you've touched on. Perhaps Agnes can answer on the second one.

285
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,530
係，阿王女士。

286
00:47:47,550 --> 00:48:07,560
屋個定價咧，其實係睇好多因素嘅。咁睇翻嗰個佢周邊嗰個誒市值嗰個誒樓價係一個因素，但係我哋睇好多嘅睇成交價，呢個係肯定係其中一個因素。另外，我哋都會睇嗰個負擔能力嘅，就話譬如我哋居屋，我哋會有佢嗰個入息啊，同埋個資產嗰個限額㗎嘛。咁

287
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:27,570
我哋都會計嘅。如果用呢一個噉樣嘅羣組嘅人，佢如果去一個即係誒去銀行攞按揭，我哋即係估計佢譬如攞做到九成按揭，做一個二十年嘅按揭，佢究竟我哋要計翻個負擔比率係咪可以有cover到咧？咁咁然後先至會定價嘅。咁所以係成一難知嘅因素，就唔係話齋睇嗰個市面。

288
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:47,580
嗰個樓價咁誒房協嗰啲，佢有佢類似嘅嗰個做法，咁都係睇翻咁綠油雅苑嗰個情況，可能都要睇翻。就當時佢最初最初嗰陣時咧，就個定位其實係高過呢個居屋少少嘅嚇，咁所以當時嗰個有有其他嘅考慮因素係在入面咯嚇。好，跟住係梁耀忠議員，都係第一次。

289
00:48:47,580 --> 00:49:02,830
主席，剛才咧，阿梁家怡議員問嗰個問題咧，有關嗰個富户咧，係逼到一啲年青人咧走出嚟咧，依個事實咧係我哋上次都即係講過依個問題，即係喺唔同場合都講過依個問題。咁其實依個問題係真係嚴重嘅。

290
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:10,240
當當剛才咧，阿阿署長講話咧，依個一個矛盾嚟啦。咁但係其實依個唔係矛盾嚟嘅，依個事實係一個乜嘢咧？

291
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,560
係你製咗啲問題出嚟嘅。

292
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:32,980
因為點解咧？大家見到咧，就係而家嗰個嘅單誒年青人嗰個嘅誒，即係輪候上屋嗰度咧，有層八萬幾八萬幾。噉你咧就提出到啲數字出嚟咧，就有即係三廿幾percent啊，就係一啲嘅誒三誒唔係有有誒咩三十五歲以。

293
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:47,490
以下嗰啲咧就有誒六十六六成半啊噉樣，佢就好高。但係呢班呢班朋友咧，我唔知你有冇啲數字畀到我哋啦嚇。究竟佢哋係係唔係教嚟多，都係喺公屋裏邊嘅咧噉樣樣？

294
00:49:47,810 --> 00:50:05,530
但係如果係嘅話咧，你就逼人走嘅，即係諗住咧就將來我而家做緊即係即係誒揾緊工作，或者係我啲誒學歷冇咁高啦。噉我為咗將來著想嘅話咧，我就出出出嚟噉樣樣。但係如果唔係，如果佢唔係個扶助政策嘅話咧，佢留翻裏邊嘅話咧，就唔使增加依個依個噉嘅訴求。

295
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:25,820
唔單止對於公屋嘅訴求嘅，咁有有啲咧就下一即係即係文件再講啦嚇，就可能佢買私人樓宇嗰度增加咗佢咧，亦都係咧對私人市場嗰個需求等等咧，其實有依一個嘅客觀嘅一個嘅環境因素存在喺度嘅，咁所以依個咧雖然頭先啊處長你話你會。

296
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:45,830
翻去睇睇啦。就上次我哋已經上講咗一段時間啦，你都未有一個嘅回覆我哋。噉我希望你咧就真係去睇睇依個問題。但係同時期咧，啊主席，其實我睇下咧依個依個文件裏邊咧，將我哋好多嘅羣組分咗出嚟啦嚇。但係其實冇咩方向性，點樣解決問題嘅噃？係只係堆砌咗一啲嘅數字畀我哋知道。

297
00:50:45,880 --> 00:51:05,890
咁咧就誒，同埋咁多範疇裏邊嚟講嘅咧，我我哋一次個傾咧係傾唔到嘅，又有又有啲嘅誒誒非長者單身人士啊，你又有一啲嘅誒長者啊，噉樣等等咁多，咁咧就我覺得咧就可以嘅話咧，就有集中某一個羣組去即係詳細深入討論咗，好好。

298
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,370
啲嘅，咁譬如佢講到一個嘅非長者單身裏邊嚟講話咧。

299
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:30,660
係只係堆砌咗數字，我哋就冇一個解決方案，或者係冇乜嘢長遠嘅策略喺度存在喺度。噉啊，點討論咧？冇冇好討論嘅畀人講嘅。咁其實咧就誒，我覺得咧就誒，如果我自己睇嗰個誒非長者單身人士嗰度咧，你第一個問題裏邊嚟講就係。

300
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:43,040
現時你誒畀得每年啊，大約係二千個單位畀佢哋嘅話咧，誒咁少而佢八萬幾個單位，八萬幾人申請，你點去解決依個問題啊？你想幾多年先解決到佢哋啊？

301
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,070
你係想佢自然流失，即係唔好再排你隊啊，還是點樣樣咧？

302
00:51:49,590 --> 00:52:09,600
Mr. Chairman, the dilemma we have, of course, is that these things are still being considered by the strategy group. That's why we're coming early, so we can get your views to reflect back to them. And then, when they publish their report, we'll come back and talk about the specific recommendations. But we're not at that stage yet, so I can't do very much about that, I'm afraid. In terms of

303
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:17,960
the the issue of numbers. Of course, there are two points here. First.

304
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,100
people join the waiting list for many different reasons.

305
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:42,660
Yes, as other members have said, some is because they live in dreadful accommodation, very poor accommodation, and that's absolutely right. But for other people, and those tend to be people who are living in public rental housing estates, they want to create their own family unit. They want to split from their families, and that's again an entirely legitimate thing for them.

306
00:52:42,660 --> 00:53:02,670
That tends to be the younger people. That's why we do have people on our waiting lists that currently live in public rental housing, and we need to accommodate their needs as well as everyone else's. That's that's where the the choices come in. So, in terms of the the young people on the waiting list, there there does appear to be a large number.

307
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:22,680
但 of course when we come to assess their entitlement against our asset and income limits, we find that the younger people by the time they're assessed no longer qualify, and the the challenge we have as the housing authority is how can we somehow look at the list and perhaps rationalise it.

308
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:42,690
to take out the people who are not going to qualify. For example, we know that there are a large number of students who apply when they go to university. They're not going to qualify for assessment for a number of years. By the time they're assessed, of course, their income and asset limit is way above the entitlement and requirements for public rental housing. So this is the the management.

309
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:48,630
Requirement on that QPS list, and I accept what the the honourable member is saying. We must manage this more actively.

310
00:53:48,910 --> 00:54:08,920
主席誒，好簡單啫，就可唔可以第十二段咧嗰啲數字咧，可唔可以再多啲詳細嘅一啲嘅背景，交畀我哋咧？即係多啲，譬如包括咗咧，佢話三十歲、三十五歲以下嘅有有六成半嘅人申請啦，就誒，其實佢三十五歲嗰個背景點樣樣咧？佢哋嗰個學歷啊，包括咗埋佢哋嗰個嘅而家嘅。

311
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,070
嘅誒誒，即係住居住嘅嘅居所喺邊度啊？咁等等嗰啲可唔可以咧？

312
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:26,850
啊啊！白居易啊，你你有個密切的。Mr. Chairman, it is already there actually. Mr. Chairman, it is the latter part of that. You know, for example, 34% were students, 47 of those had post-secondary or above education. The information is already in the paper.

313
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,030
好。

314
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:48,360
唔係啊！但係誒，各位就時間夠啦，梁院超過好多添啊！唔係，我想叫佢畀資料我哋啫嘛，我唔係想唔想討論。佢話有噉，跟你再跟進啦，好嘛？誒嗱，噉樣因為而家都接近九點半，而家第一個議程嘅第一輪咧，登記發言咧，仲有石米軒、鍾樹根，仲有。

315
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,790
本人作為議員咧，都想發言。

316
00:54:51,070 --> 00:55:11,080
咁因此咧，就係誒，我就希望咧噉嘅安排。第一輪啊，唔係第一個議程咧，就誒第一輪發言完咗之後咧，就轉入去下一個議程。至於登記咗第二輪嘅同事咧，我就想噉嘅安排，就畀你哋咧喺。

317
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:31,090
第二個議程嘅時候咧，就第一輪再第一輪登記噉樣，因為咧其實嗰啲問題都牽涉嘅，好嘛？咁咧第二輪登記咧，我講個次序啦，就啱啱畀你哋再下一個議程嘅第一輪發言嘅登記人啦，有郭嘉琪、誒胡志偉、張昭雄、郭偉強、李卓日。

318
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,560
嚇噉樣嚇。

319
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:52,850
咁誒，而家咧就係誒石禮謙，你係第一輪嘅嚇，仲有鍾樹根，然後到我就完咗第一輪嚇。誒，多謝主席。主席，我想問政府攞啲資料啫。自從佢開放咗依個誒居屋嘅二手市場，嗰個起。

320
00:55:52,850 --> 00:56:12,860
嘅個起個誒起個價錢喺二十喺依個居屋個價錢起咗幾多？第一誒，阿石議員，你呢個問題似乎唔係我哋今日討論呢個主席係啊，我點點解咧有個理由喺度，即係依個咧係整體一個長遠佢嗰個計劃嚟嘅，主席。即係你你覺得唔係咧，但係我我。

321
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:32,870
點解拉翻轉頭嚟講？所以我就咁清楚、咁清晰嘅第一問咗出嚟先。依個係依個長遠，依個全整體，依個係我哋長遠嘅發展嘅。誒，我依個佢答唔答係佢嘅事，主席。我只係攞個資料。第二樣嘢，頭先我想跟進咧，阿梁家傑議員嗰度咧係講個。

322
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:52,880
白表各方面都係講房屋，嘅都係長遠嘅，主席。咁白白表梁家傑，頭先問佢點解要去到誒嗰個最近個居屋賣嗰度誒房房協賣出嚟嗰六千三蚊咧？政府嘅答咧，佢一攬子，佢非常時間攞啲屋出嚟，佢咁去賣賣翻畀佢，又畀白表去買咧，主席。

323
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:12,890
佢係用一個六千三蚊，六千三蚊個係從一個市場掛鈎。而家個市場升到升到可以政府啊，自己都要要要咁多一輪辣椒，第二輪辣椒咁去做。點解佢唔可以特殊嘅情況去去令到降温翻？一方面咧。

324
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:32,900
咧就喺個私人市場嗰度咧，就猛要放辣椒嚟降温。第二喺個自己政府個市場嗰度裏邊咧，呢個居屋嗰度咧，嗰啲人都唔係都話佢就去承擔咩叫承擔啦？你如果用個市場嘅個市場已經，你政府都覺得佢唔啱啦，點可以承擔咧？佢點解要喺佢？

325
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,750
比比私人發展商仲賺多錢個。

326
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:51,610
誒喺一個噉嘅噉嘅項目嗰度，好啦。點解佢哋當時冇留考慮過係令到一個佢佢哋真正可以買樓嗰啲嚟，唔係用個市場掛鈎，係用佢個成本掛鈎。

327
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,340
啊，主席長。

328
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,620
Sorry, Mr. Chairman, we.

329
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:08,110
I don't think we have the information you're asking for in terms of the rate of increase in the HOS market because, you know.

330
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:09,950
It's it varies.

331
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:28,560
We don't know specifically on the secondary market because we don't monitor that. We control directly the sale of first-hand HOS units, so that's where our focus is. But I would say that it's very very difficult to say that there's any particular cause and effect relating to the 5,000 white form units because.

332
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:48,850
You know, we we haven't actually allocated any yet, so of course there hasn't actually been any direct influence as far as we can tell. I would also say that the measures that we've introduced are not just related to the private market; they apply across the board to all residential properties. For example, the new legislation that we hope to bring in in April.

333
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:57,940
relating to the sale of first-hand properties applies equally to the H.O.S. sales and to things like Greenview Villas. We don't make any distinction.

334
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:18,230
主席個問題嘅先啦，點解要咁問咧？所以你你就跳咗我，唔畀我問啦。個理由因為佢六千三蚊咧，佢六千三蚊咧，佢就用個市場。如果佢冇可能咧，佢一一宣一宣佈咗依個政策出嚟咧，個個二手市場喺依個依個誒誒。

335
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:38,240
誒居屋嗰度咧起到好犀利，所以因為起咗咁犀利咧，先係用個掛鈎再去出個價錢防跌，出個價錢咧，因為個二手市場就去有成交咗啦，就咁嚟掛鈎六千三蚊啦，主席。所以我問個問題有個理由喺度嘅，主席。啊，我係畀你問，唔係唔畀。多謝你。

336
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:50,070
誒有冇補充啊，柏志高先生？Mr. Chairman, as I say, I'm I'm not sure that you can make that direct relationship until the the the 5,000 units come in. I don't think there has an effect.

337
00:59:50,430 --> 01:00:09,250
關係咧係嗰種，一佢就佢唔答唔緊要，因為佢佢自己會知道清楚。係佢可以佢冇資料可以唔答，但係佢應該要做個研究。佢因為咧依個係影響到佢佢去物有做個價錢嗰陣時咧，嗰個嗰個價錢咧就影響到個市價。個市價就係因為氣狀。

338
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:22,350
啊！食完就你表達咗，我亦都畀你表達咗。不過我希望咧，就大家注意唔好搭音，因為搭音我都聽唔清楚，我都唔知啊記錄記唔記錄得到。咁而家時間超過咗啦，跟住係棕樹根魚。

339
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:42,640
主席，誒我即係覺得依份文件咧都係唔係咁好。你即係你雖然你分咗唔同嘅羣組咧，但係你都冇講到嘅任何解決嘅方案。你作為一個長遠策略咧，你應該話畀我哋聽。你雖然點咗一啲問題出嚟，啲問題幾短期，你點解決咧？長期你點解決咧？

340
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:57,050
你話我發個你依依啲份文件咧，就好似拎嚟應付下我哋就算啦。但係你解最終個目的，你係解決到點解而家輪候公屋咁長時間、公屋短缺嘅問題啊嘛？

341
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:17,340
有好多你所謂提供嘅答案咧，係解決唔到嘅，即係等佢攞綜援啦，係嘛？津貼下佢啦，短期你可以津貼下佢。到啲租貴嘅時候，你又點樣津貼下佢咧？係嘛？咁所以呢個問題咧，我覺得你依個整個策略咧，你真係要重新去考慮下點樣去解決個問。

342
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:25,310
問題，我覺得短期嘅問題咧，我哋好多議員又講過，前個期講過啦，呢個庫嘅政策。

343
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,050
造成一啲問題。

344
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:48,340
就而家出現咁個庫户嗰個咧，可唔可以嗰個限額個數字咧？你而家即時提升一啲，就唔好講咁多人出去走。講出去走嘅時候咧，佢都係造成房屋嘅問題嘅啫。第二就係嗰啲畀你講走嗰啲，又而家你要諗一個方法，畀佢可以重新入翻户。其實講真咧，又

345
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:57,760
有啲已經係仲係屈蛇緊喺自己老豆嗰間屋度住嘅啫，係嘛？噉你點樣可以畀佢重新入門咧？超過十八歲嘅仔女。

346
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,890
而家唔畀加入誒。

347
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:13,510
父即係即係父母嘅嘅公屋嘅，而家可唔可以放寬？你如果你呢啲放寬咧，你就會使到你嗰條龍咧，或者年青人入誒住公屋嘅問題咧，又減少一啲。

348
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:33,800
第二咧就係話點解咁多劏房咧？劏房就係唔夠住啊嘛！你唔夠住，人哋咪劏房咯。喂，依個係解決方案嚟嘅喎，係市民自己用自己嘅方法去解決。就佢環環境衞生唔得又好，唔安全又好，依個係另一個問題。但係佢為咗住，佢就要噉樣做。噉你政

349
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:40,300
府係咪都要諗下你自己可唔可以做一啲堅固嘅環境好啲嘅劏房出嚟咧？

350
01:02:40,790 --> 01:03:00,800
你係要噉樣解決，個冇辦法㗎喎。而家你要短期解決嘅問題，你可唔可以作為一啲中轉屋啊？臨好似以前噉，你有臨時房屋區啊。但係而家係唔好以前咁惡劣啦。你係咪可以起工廠大廈嚇做一啲你自己認為合標準、合格嘅劏房出嚟咧？甚至係一啲空嘅。

351
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:20,810
嘅地方，你做一啲環境好啲嚇隔熱嘅誒，有有好嘅衞生設施嘅臨時房屋咧，因為你而家咧下下咧都要等成五六年都未未等到，我手頭十幾個個案咧，個個都等咗六六七年嘅，即係你哋又話三年。

352
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:40,820
我上樓，我就真係唔知你點樣做到，即係你要有短期，就算唔係好stand特嘅嘢，好標準嘅嘢，你都要諗一啲方法去解決啊嘛，而唔係咧喺度帶我哋遊花園咧講九萬幾種方法，其實冇某種方法係可以可行、有效咁解決嘅。多謝主席。阿柏超生。

353
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:50,850
先生，我我 believe我 answered the first point. The whole point of this paper is to present the problems. These are the issues that the long-term housing strategy steering group are looking at.

354
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,760
They are still considering the solutions.

355
01:03:54,040 --> 01:04:14,050
We're not yet in a position to come to members with the recommendations that they've made just because they haven't made any yet. The process is ongoing, and as I understand it, that's the purpose of this committee, to monitor the progress as we go forward, and also have the opportunity to give your views so that we can reflect them back to the members. So I will of course reflect your views, but I would.

356
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:19,940
I say a couple of things in terms of relaxing the criterion for well-off families, the.

357
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,870
The criterion are actually pretty.

358
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:43,340
Well considered by the housing authority. The reality is that they have to be very well in excess. I think it's eighty something times in excess before we force people out. The first step is to apply either one five or two times the rental level to those people who are just above or significantly above.

359
01:04:43,340 --> 01:05:03,350
Those people who are both in excess for their income and their assets are the only ones that we look at to remove, and then they're given a year and they're given time to do that. So I think the current the current policy in wealth tenancy is well considered, and it's reviewed on a regular basis. So that that that does already happen. So I.

360
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:14,640
I don't think it's a matter of relaxing the criterion. It's a matter of making sure the criterion are appropriate for the type of people we have in our in our in our in our housing. In terms of

361
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:34,930
提供不同種類嘅accommodation，我諗嗰啲嘅嘢，我覺得係。

362
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:44,090
議員就我用我嗰四分鐘嚇，你嗰都係最後一個啦嚇。如果下一輪咧，就係去下一個議程啦嚇。

363
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,360
而家我開始用我嗰四分鐘。

364
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:55,070
對於呢一份誒討論文件咧，因為大家都睇到咧，係係傾嗰個係特定羣組需要。

365
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:59,090
就在呢一份文件咧，我認為咧係有。

366
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:11,480
不足嘅。雖然文件嘅第二段咧就講長者、非長者單親人士、居住環境惡劣住户、年輕人同埋首次置業者四類。

367
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:21,430
但係咧，我就覺得咧，喺研究呢個住屋需要嘅時候咧，唔單單只係呢四個羣組。

368
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:38,930
作為長遠房屋策略咧，就我覺得咧，從嗰個分析需要嘅入手嚟去講咧，我認為係必須係要就香港嗰個家庭變化呢個元素要做分析。

369
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:45,550
第二，必須就著香港經濟條件變化嚟去做分析。

370
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:56,140
第三亦都必須咧，係就香港嗰個人口嘅變化嘅情況嚟去做分析。

371
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:06,450
第四咧，亦都必須咧就著政府自己嘅公屋政策嘅變化嚟去做分析。

372
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:14,260
如果係離開咗呢幾個嘅變化情況嚟去做分析咧？

373
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:28,300
而只係就著文件第二段嗰四個特定組羣嚟去分析咧，就變咗嗰個研究對策咧，只係就問題嘅。

374
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,360
嘅現象。

375
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:37,170
唔係就問題嘅根本，去探索問題嘅成因。

376
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:56,030
所以咧，我作為議員咧，我希望政府嘅長遠房屋策略小組，即係政府嗰個誒長策小組，要就我剛才嗰啲建議咧嚟去做研究分析，然後先可以咧係。

377
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:04,440
對應問題嘅根本就唔係咧，只係誒頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳。

378
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:12,730
點解我作出呢個建議咧？我舉兩個例子嚟，同阿柏志高先生講。

379
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:33,020
第一個例子就係人口變化，譬如話，你係咪需要研究香港因為呢個人口變化嘅結構嚟造成嘅問題咧？例如新來港嘅市民，你有冇研究新來港市民本身有啲家庭團聚？

380
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:45,100
原因有啲係工作嘅原因，本身或者有啲各種嘅原因，亦造成咧香港嘅房屋需要。嗱，呢個有一個好重要，你要研究分析嘅。

381
01:08:45,580 --> 01:09:05,590
似乎咧呢度冇去進行呢一類嘅考慮咯。我舉嘅第二個例子就點解要研究翻本身政府自己嘅公共房屋政策都係由於變化亦製造問題咧？其實剛才多位議員就已經指出呢個問題，我。

382
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:25,600
我過往亦都係歷屆相關會議啊、立法會，而都指出嘅問題，譬如話政府嘅副政策，所謂嘅副政策，同而家政府嘅呢一個係畀啲同啲長者安居樂業年嘅政策自相矛盾，一。

383
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:45,610
方面，你係想安老，但係一方面你係將啲後生仔趕出公屋嗱。呢個因為你個矛盾，即係等於頭先鐘樹根議員所講嘅問題啦，咪造成你又製造需求。咁喺噉嘅情況底下，呢啲你如果你唔去全面去睇咧，你就唔能夠説明個問題。

384
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:57,160
呢個係例子意義，噉我呢四分鐘咧就用完啦，就唔需要你答。請你係翻去同啊長策嗰個小組嚟去反映。

385
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,150
我嘅發言咧就完啦。你唔使答啦，因為冇時間。我都係守規矩嘅。

386
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:23,750
各位議員，咁而家咧今日嘅議程呢一個係講緊特定羣組住屋需要呢個議程咧，呢個議題咧就到此為止。我哋而家咧就轉落去下一個議程，下一個議程咧，我哋都係請阿柏志高先生咧係就政府。

387
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:43,760
準備嘅文件咧，作出介紹，然後咧就畀大家發問。阿柏超則，請。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll keep it very short. But I would just say, of course, your point is well taken, and the next paper deals with the issues relating to the public housing policies. So the second paper, we do set out the existing policies on public rental housing.

388
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:56,510
housing，including the quota points system，well-off tenants policies，the underoccupation policy，overcrowding relief arrangements，redevelopment of aged estates and measures to tackle abuse of public rental housing。

389
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,710
作為這些是 Housing Authority 政策， views and suggestions from both the

390
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:10,620
subcommittee here today and the long-term housing strategy steering committee will be brought back to the housing authority for them to consider.

391
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:30,910
我哋想指出，係The LTHS，The Long-Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee，，hasn't come to any specific conclusions and recommendations。我需要repeat this，因為似乎有個印象係，，we're at that point。The work is focused on gathering data and analysing the current situation，and of course，the whole objective is that

392
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:50,920
We collect the information, as the chairman has said. We will look at the demographics. We will look at things like the ageing population, a very important issue. Hence, in the last paper, we talked about elderly as a particular area, but it arises from that general demographic problem. We're also looking at a more general issue relating to.

393
01:11:50,920 --> 01:12:04,650
The economic development, as well as, in this case, the changes and the situation with respect to the public housing programme. Mr Chairman, I'll stop there. We stand ready to answer questions.

394
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:24,900
好嗱，而家咧就我哋咧係討論C.P.庫一六零零斜棟一二一三庫零三個文件，充分和合理運用公共租住房屋資源嘅措施。我哋而家討論呢個議題，已經舉個手嘅咧，因為喺上一輪。

395
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:35,730
就係第二，佢上個議程嘅第二輪咧，佢冇辦法畀到佢發言，所以頭先我係宣佈咗咧，佢喺去到呢個議程咧，佢作為係係。

396
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:56,020
排咗落呢度嘅誒，先後有郭家麒、胡志偉、張昭雄、郭偉強、李卓仁，跟住係有陶錦新，仲有邊一位想輪候發言？你哋舉手啦嚇！我哋都係四分鐘，我哋咧今日嘅會議咧最多可以去到十點半，大家都知道緊，家我哋有大會嘅嚇，所以希望大家把握時間。

397
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,220
連乜連得？請郭家麒議員主席。

398
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,220
即係我覺得咧，政府咧，其實兩份文件咧，都係令我哋相當失望。

399
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:11,270
頭先講話 phụ huệ政策，或者要趕七千個人走咧，我唔知政府係諗啲咩嘢。

400
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:26,760
我哋好多時咧都好難避免要同一啲其他鄰近地方去比較，譬如新加坡。主席，我哋有份文件話要睇鄰近地方咧，包括新加坡有原因。新加坡到而家啲祖屋咧，嗰個入息嘅上限咧。

401
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,960
通常係以一個家庭為計，係八千蚊波子，差唔多即係講緊係四萬蚊度。

402
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,940
香港。

403
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:51,240
而家嗰個所謂入息嘅上限，無論公屋同埋居屋咧，都係完全係不近人情，製造好多悲劇。即係譬如啲屈蛇啊，啲屋企人啊，畀人即係拆散咗你嘅家庭啊，又要點分啊噉樣。

404
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,110
係政府一手造成。

405
01:13:55,240 --> 01:14:03,110
政府係用好多個方法，係將一啲係輪候公屋或者有資格輪候公屋咧，係排除喺嗰嗰度。

406
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:08,220
咁當然你唔會明啦，你哋嗰啲高官嚇，個個幾廿萬一個月。

407
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:28,900
即係，我覺得呢個係完全咧係冇理到個社會實際情況嘅一個做法。如果政府長遠嘅做法仲係唔去檢討而家個入息上限，無論公屋同埋居屋嘅話咧，其實製造更多更加多嘅悲劇。其實好多呢啲住劏房嗰啲咧係逼出嚟嘅，譬如佢如果唔守你嘅規矩。

408
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,940
噉你梗係要收佢間屋啦。

409
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:39,830
噉佢係根本冇錢住出邊嘅屋㗎嘛？而傢俬人嗰啲屋係幾貴，大家都知道。佢去得邊度住咧？唔住劏廠同埋劏房。

410
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:46,980
即係政府咧一手造成呢一樣嘢，一啲好多流寓嘅悲劇，土地政策嘅你手上。

411
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:52,630
公屋居屋嘅入息上，係你手上，其實乜嘢都係你你自己做出嚟。

412
01:14:54,060 --> 01:15:01,770
呢個地價嘅高地價嘅政策，亦都係政府由前朝殖民地去到而家咧，係完全咧都係一貫去做。

413
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:09,600
頭先有啲同事講得好啱，而家居屋嗰個定價咧係離曬大普，即係差唔多同地產商一樣賺到盡。

414
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,430
係與民為敵。

415
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:31,910
政府如有冇任何嘅意向去改呢一啲完全不合理嘅政策，同埋點樣對嗰六萬幾最少啊六萬幾有冇一啲？因為而家你個計分制咧，完全冇理到佢嗰個居住嘅環境啊！有冇一啲新嘅計劃係幫到呢一紮人，係盡速離開呢一個惡劣？

416
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:51,920
個家庭。白兆先生，Mr Chairman，I think you're comparing apples and oranges here. Singapore's policy is to primarily provide the equivalent of home ownership scheme. They don't really have a significant proportion of rental. Our policy, frankly, has focused on rental. Singapore's income limits for their

417
01:15:51,920 --> 01:16:01,740
Sales through the development board is around forty thousand. Our income limit for HOS is around forty thousand. There's not much difference.

418
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:22,030
Our income limit for rental, which is designed at the the people who can least afford to buy, is always reviewed on an annual basis. So that happens anyway. It's automatic. It's part of the system. But I don't think you can compare what we do here with what Singapore.直接你而家即係你你睇翻個數字啦，係嘛？即係呢個數字係好合。

419
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:23,900
都唔合理，不過唔緊要，畀佢講下。

420
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:35,890
誒繼續發言，先生。As I said, Mr. Chairman, we do look at the figures. The housing authority looks at the figures for the H.O.S. sales. The sale price is set just before we release.

421
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:53,730
the the units for sale. So, for example, we're about to release the units about 800 units of surplus accommodation that we have been unable to release so far. The range of prices ranges from about 1.8 million up to the maximum of 3.5 million.

422
01:16:54,010 --> 01:17:04,100
所以，range of prices isn't fixed. It isn't set on one price and that applies to everything. Depends on the location, the size, etc., etc. That's done just before the sale.

423
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:24,640
The income and asset limit for PRH is again reviewed on an annual basis, taking into account both movements in incomes. But also, we've just announced a refined policy which has been agreed by the housing authority, which takes into account also movements in the.

424
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,560
what is it the pri the

425
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:40,730
The pricing, I can't remember the details, but it allows us to take into account inflation, and that's important. It's the methodology which sets the rate. It's not an arbitrary process, and I think that's the important way forward, Mr. Chairman.

426
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:43,230
好，護照委員。

427
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:50,060
代主席嚟到呢一份文件咧，其實同上一慣真係相關嘅。誒，兩點，第一個咧就。

428
01:17:50,390 --> 01:18:10,400
頭先阿柏志高先生咧，一路都冇回應到就係話，其實政府對於居住喺環境惡劣嘅係居民咧，有啲乜嘢嘅具體策。其實我都畀個意見就係話咧，係請你參考翻當日、當年咧，係當政府要處理寮屋問題嘅時間所用嘅手法。

429
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:30,410
係方法，因為唯有呢個方法咧，你先至能夠第一，你清晰咗誒呢一類居住環境惡劣嘅係住户嗰個嘅居住環境有啲咩嘅改善嘅方向，你可以先從去改善安全環境着手。另一方面，都會準備到足夠嘅房屋資源咧，去應付嗰個需要。咁因此就係話。

430
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:50,420
呢個係好重要嘅一個政策嘅原則。我希望咧喺長遠房屋策略委員會呢邊咧，係可以係將呢一度咧係即係有一個好清楚嘅一個方向。第二個咧，關於嗰個年青人輪候嗰個問題，當然我哋都明白就話核心嘅問題就係話嗰個嘅係供應係唔足夠。如果仲記得嘅話咧，年青人嘅問題咧。

431
01:18:50,420 --> 01:19:07,730
咧其實喺二千年打後，大概零三年開始咧，就慢慢浮現出嚟。但係當年政府咧，就因為為咗唔起更多公屋嘅時間咧，就用咗條橋，就叫做係公屋計分制。咁結果咧，將一大扎嘅年輕人咧排除咗喺呢個隊隊伍之外嘅。

432
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,070
而我。

433
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:29,460
一路個建議就係話咧，其實你一路擔心就係呢班年青人咧，佢嘅經濟能力係會好轉，係會改善。其實呢一個咧，你係唔應該透過壓縮嗰個嘅係需要咧，係處理。應該從就係話咧，可能係佢有一個比較上短啲嘅係負。

434
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:49,470
政策嘅係即係應用咧，係能夠令到佢要早啲係要面對呢一個嘅係住房係誒入息同埋資產嘅審查嘅時間咧，係會令到呢一班嘅後生仔咧唔會成為而家呢個隊伍上邊咧。你只係依賴就係佢，因為要排十年十五。

435
01:19:49,470 --> 01:20:09,480
年嘅時間咧係一個自然嘅離開，但係唔好忘記就係話，而家嘅遲婚，而家嘅後生仔，可能佢去到呢個三十幾歲嘅時間，都係揾緊一萬蚊，一萬蚊就會過咗你嗰條界線㗎啦。咁如果噉樣講嘅時間，你點能夠講話佢哋就係一個喺你眼中？

436
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:29,490
可以有能力置業嘅人咧，亦都反映咗就話點咧？今日年青人咁多怨氣，其中核心嘅原因就係話你喺現有嘅制機制裏邊，你根本就冇提供出路畀佢。咁所以，我覺得如果你係要正視年青人嗰個輪候問題嘅話，第一唔應該從嗰個壓縮需求着手，你應該從就係話你擔心係經濟能力改善。

437
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:49,500
噉你就要係將佢嗰個要審查佢嗰個誒資產同埋入息，喺會唔會係超過或者係叫合理用後，即係個附政策嗰樣嘢咧，係早啲適應。噉我想問下呢兩個會唔會可以擺喺你嗰個嘅係長遠房屋策略小組裏邊咧，作為討論嘅題目？主席長，嗯，Mr. Chairman，in in answer to the first point，嗯。

438
01:20:49,710 --> 01:21:09,720
The government policy is is to provide accommodation in public rental housing for those who can't afford to rent decent accommodation in the private sector. That covers all of these people who are in subdivided flats and all of these other poor conditions. That's already covered. That's very clear. I think the the bigger issue is how can we accord priority

439
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,870
到一 particular group from within those people that are.

440
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:30,080
unsubstantially accommodated, and that's really I think where the LTHS has got to look at these issues and consider what are the priorities, and and we will certainly reflect your views to them for that for that reason. On the second point, on the the young people.

441
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:35,740
You're you're absolutely right. We need to give a way forward for people.

442
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,450
not just young people, but families as well.

443
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:44,330
在過去， of course， for the last ten years， we have not had the home ownership scheme route.

444
01:21:44,640 --> 01:22:04,650
因為先前 we had this blatter. It was public rental housing, homeownership scheme, the private sector. That was taken away for ten years. It has been reinstated. Unfortunately, it's going to take a little bit of time to gear up the programme again. But I agree with you. I think we do need to come up with some measures to give people in that category some hope.

445
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:06,460
however，having said that，of course。

446
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,190
The priority must always be for families.

447
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:11,210
I think that is correct.

448
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:15,610
我們 must also give priority to elderly people. I think that's also correct.

449
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:28,170
thereafter you're you're setting different priorities for different categories one of those categories which is specifically being looked at in this exercise are young people and I I will reflect members' view on this one.

450
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,470
因為時時間問題啦。

451
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:32,910
誒，跟住係張超雄議員。

452
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,880
多謝主席。誒文件嘅第六段咧，就顯示。

453
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:44,500
而家輪候嘅情況，三年之後先至首次獲配公屋嘅。

454
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:50,510
由百分之三十咧，就去到百分之四十五。

455
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:58,020
即係接近一半嘅所謂一般申請者咧，其實三年之後先至有屋嘅。

456
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,130
另外超過三年都未配屋嘅咧。

457
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:13,430
就由百分之十三增加到百分之十五，即係而家輪候嘅情況係越嚟越嚴重，越嚟越長。輪候嘅人數或者住户嘅數目，亦都不斷增加緊。

458
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:22,730
噉啊，根據啊特首個競選嘅個政綱裏邊咧，佢喺關於增建公屋嗰度，佢有咁講嘅。

459
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:33,800
誒根據長遠房屋策略嘅供求評估，適量增建公屋，確保家庭申請者及三十五歲以下誒，對唔住三十五歲以上。

460
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,160
非長者一人申請者平均輪候時間同為三年。

461
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:50,840
嗱，而家佢嗰個數字咧根本就冇乜可能啊！因為三五歲以上嘅非長者單身申請者咧，而家個輪候時間係好長。

462
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:57,830
嗱，個政綱繼續講，並縮短三十五歲以下嘅非長者一人申請輪候時間。

463
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:11,320
我想問，即係喺特首嘅政綱噉樣講，就話要縮短呢啲時間，亦都指明三十五歲以上嘅單身人士會縮短到三年。

464
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:21,270
誒而家局方有乜嘢策略？喺又唔增加，即係而家又係繼續係個萬五個。

465
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:33,890
嘅公屋供應喺唔增加供應底下，點樣樣可以達到呢個特首嘅承諾？另外，仲有一點咧，就係佢有提到話。

466
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:48,330
人口老化嚴重啲嘅屋邨咧，呢個係佢正剛咁講，加設長者綜合服務設設施，鼓勵居家安老。我亦都想問局方喺呢方面有咩具體嘅計劃？好啊，阿秘書長。

467
01:24:48,940 --> 01:25:08,950
Mr. Chairman, difficult for me to comment on a manifesto pledge, because that of course is a pledge in a manifesto. It's something that we have to take into account in the LTHS, but it's not something that I can comment on. I can only really comment on what we're doing in the LTHS. I can say it's being looked at. It is something that will be covered in the in the discussions.

468
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:29,350
to answer the second part of the question, in terms of the public rental housing estates, there is already an aggressive programme to ensure that our facilities do match the needs of all of our tenants, not just young people, but families as well as elderly tenants. So, for example, we have an aggressive policy of

469
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:49,360
introducing lifts and escalators into those estates which simply don't have them. We have an aggressive policy of working with NGOs to introduce care facilities for the elderly, day care centres and what have you. We're converting playgrounds into facilities that are more suitable for elderly tenants in estates where there are large numbers of elderly.

470
01:25:49,360 --> 01:26:09,370
all of that programme is already underway. It's already part of our policy commitment, and is something being led by the housing authority. The wider issue of what should be done in the wider community beyond the boundaries of the public rental housing estates, of course, is another issue that I think the elderly commission has to look at, because.

471
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:29,380
those requirements have to be considered in the context, for example, of town planning requirements, the town planning ordinance and so on. Because you can't very quickly change the use of facilities unless you have a proper assessment of the requirements.主席，誒，我想誒，即係要插嘴咧。就第一，我哋所

472
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:34,760
講嘅居家安樂唔係淨係嗰啲普通嘅設施，而係可能要包括一啲。

473
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:55,050
服務嘅設施，即係譬如話係老人院舍呢類，令到佢哋可以喺社區入邊，包括咗呢啲公共屋邨入邊繼續居住。另外，我頭先講到特首個承諾咧係好具體嘅，咁但係誒常備竟然就話佢唔可以評論噉樣。

474
01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:15,060
呢個係特首嘅承諾嚟㗎嘛，噉我假設佢即係上一場一定要做啦，咁而家個現況就係個情況越嚟越差嘅，噉佢連具體嘅措施或者政策都提唔出，去點樣誒令到特首嘅承諾得以落實咧？我覺得呢個係即係唔掂喎，主席。我作為長。

475
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:26,640
強拆嘅領導人咧，我更覺得佢更加係要回應呢一點嘅。好啊，時間問題咧，你啱排第二輪，睇下可唔可以再係要求到政府回應咧？好嘛，誒，而家跟住郭偉強議員。

476
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,960
多謝主席。

477
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,340
秘書長。

478
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:35,880
回應翻咧係關於第一份文件嘅，因為咧誒睇翻實際上嗰個情況咧。

479
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:56,220
各方咧，其實係對於一個長遠嘅住屋需要咧，特別係青年人嘅住屋需要咧，係束手無策，因為咧五千個居屋單位咧要幾年後先至有，短暫咧只係能夠提供五千個買二手居屋免補地價嘅。

480
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:10,220
嘅抽籤嚇，而呢個抽籤咧，亦都唔擔保市場上有足夠嘅二手居屋嘅樓盤去售賣。所謂咧，可謂可以話係中空寶啊，即係話抽中咗都唔一定賣到樓。

481
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:17,330
另外咧，我亦都就住早前咧，民政事務局咧就話青年宿舍。

482
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:23,470
嘅入住啊，成功入住青年宿舍嘅朋友得二百個啫，咁嚟緊。

483
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:43,760
就要即時取消申請公屋嘅資格，呢個咧，我認為係唔合理嘅做法。用一啲短暫嘅住屋計劃去掩蓋一啲長遠嘅住屋需要咧，係一個緩慢無理嘅做法。呢個咧，希望咧，秘書長。

484
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,120
將咧能夠將呢個信息帶翻翻去。

485
01:28:46,730 --> 01:29:06,740
另外咧，就住誒，剛才秘書長咧就提到就話誒，我提咗一個九萬九萬一個數，就係話非長者單身人士嘅輪候噉啊。秘書長咧就回應就話冇呢個數字喺手，但係咧希望咧秘書長睇翻文件第十二段當中咧，就都好清楚。

486
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:26,750
八萬七千八噉，我只不過四寫五入，接近九萬嚇。如果話冇呢個數咧，呢個就對文件唔理唔理解啦。實際上就有成接近九萬人輪候緊，所以我頭先好堅決要問，究竟嚟緊個供應量點樣滿足呢九萬人嘅需要？因

487
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:46,760
因為咧，好擔心局方咧就用一個扣分制，個扣分制好危險啊！扣分制咧，十八歲係零分㗎，跟住每一年加三分。但係你只要係而家住緊公屋咧，即時扣你三啊分，即係話咧住緊公屋嘅年青人咧，頭十年都係零分㗎。

488
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:53,230
頭十年零分咧，如果佢十八至到廿八歲中間要結婚嘅話咧，佢係。

489
01:29:53,650 --> 01:30:13,660
解決唔到個住屋問題，如果佢仲要唔好彩中正個庫户政策嘅話咧，佢分分鐘喺呢十年裏邊要搬出呢間公屋，先至去換取一啲高啲嘅分數，或者重新去排個隊。呢個做法咧係不合理。究竟局方能唔？

490
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:14,700
能夠。

491
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:30,730
去豁免就係話，而家住緊公屋就要即時扣三廿分呢個問題，因為你計分逐年逐年加，O K，大家可能都知道有咪需要，但係你即時扣三廿分嘅話咧，係完全。

492
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:48,410
剝削咗佢哋一個輪候嘅機會，同埋根本佢唔可能排喺前面，佢永遠都係排喺後邊。你逼啲人出去租私樓，租私樓咧，只會進一步推高嗰個私人市場個租金，呢個係唔合理。

493
01:30:48,860 --> 01:31:08,870
究竟局方嚟緊點樣可以解決呢個問題，同埋點回應我呢個訴求？多謝主席。誒，得翻三秒啫。啊，秘書長。Mr. Chairman, very quickly, in terms of the the ninety thousand, as I say, we don't have a figure of ninety thousand. I think the figure we've given is from March of two.

494
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:28,880
二千零十二，它八七或什麼，但係當前數字，唔，唔分解到邊個係實際資格或者唔資格，呢個係比較重要嘅數字，因為我哋需要睇下邊個需要提供住宿，所以呢個係一個問題。喺供應單位方面，對於年青人，呢個。

495
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:34,240
this deduction of thirty to thirty odd points, of course, we're looking at.

496
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:54,720
The problem of someone who is already in decent accommodation in PRH, as opposed to someone who's queuing, who may be living in a subdivided flat or a bedspace apartment, where's the priority? The housing authority has taken the view: people who are already given substantial accommodation should not have as much priority as the other people.

497
01:31:54,720 --> 01:32:14,730
that we've been talking about this morning, who are in much worse situation. That's the dilemma. We have to have a way to allocate the scarce resources, and this is the way they've decided to do it. But I will reflect your views to the LTHS for their consideration, because I think you're right. The young single people have a particular area we need to look.

498
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:17,480
and hence that's why it's set out in the last paper.

499
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:38,600
阿李卓仁議員，多謝主席。咁頭先張超雄議員都問咗，即係關於三十五歲以上。噉我覺得好震驚一樣嘢，就係好似即係原來唔係我哋當阿梁振英冇到，而係即係即係房屋局都係當梁振英冇到。咁梁振英嗰個選舉承諾，原來都係即係一個梁振。

500
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:58,610
應自己個人嘅嘅一個承諾，同個成個政府冇關係。即係我真係好出奇，奇好震驚，就係係你梁振英冇同你講到佢嘅選舉承諾，梁振英係冇叫到你去諗，即係咁似梁振英呃人啦嚇，咁都唔出奇嘅，呃人嚇。

501
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:18,620
咁定係其實佢同你講咗，不過你哋耍佢咧，咁即係起碼依度冇理由，即係好似乜嘢乜嘢答案都冇嘅，或者乜嘢諗法都冇嘅，咁即係變成三五歲以上嘅即係單身人士要等幾多年咧？頭先大家知道三五歲以上嗰啲係單身人士係要計分制，如果你

502
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:38,630
三五上歲咧，即係差唔多等一年有二千嘅單位。頭先梁宇忠都講咗啦，即係你講等到頸都長都唔使諗啊！根本三五歲以下更加冇得諗，三五歲以上亦都係冇得諗。咁呢方面好似冇任何嘅答案。第二個問題咧，即係我覺得就係合理即係分配公屋資源咧，好簡單問咧。

503
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:54,380
就係而家有一個嘅誒改善居住嘅計劃，就係如果你啊平均係少個七咧，就可以改善居住，可以有間大啲嘅房。咁但係點知咧，你有個單位咧就廿一點一。

504
01:33:54,750 --> 01:34:04,370
就三個人住咧，七點零三，咁呢七點零三嗰啲咧，全部冇得改善居住。咁有啲嘅問題係咩咧？有啲有十幾歲嘅仔女。

505
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:08,560
咁一個人帶住兩個十幾歲嘅仔女。

506
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:23,460
係真係一間咁細嘅單位住咧，噉係好唔方便，亦都係冇好冇空間畀佢哋發展。咁點解唔可以改善佢哋咧？就係點就係因為佢佢話解釋點解唔可以咧？就係因為七點零三米啦。

507
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:43,840
噉你即係揾人品，你整設計間屋係唔係廿二？如果你設計間屋廿二咧，又啱啱好喎；你設計間屋廿一咧，咪啱啱唔好咯。咁即係除三，你哋真係計數計到咁盡啊，係咪？咁依方面可唔可以改善咧？兩個問題，議事長。Mr. Chairman, as I said, I'm not commenting on manifesto issues, but the long

508
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:49,580
長 term housing strategy is reviewing those issues. It has to, because it's all part of the long term commitment.

509
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:58,710
That government has to make. We have to address all of the comments that are coming in, including those set out in the manifesto. I'm just not in a position to comment on them, so don't get me wrong here.

510
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:04,240
Okay, he's made those commitments. They refer to the LTHS. It's the appropriate way to take them forward.

511
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:22,520
In terms of the rational allocation policies and the various issues, of course, the sort of scenario you describe of a family with two teenagers, they may apply. Of course, they can, if there are suitable accommodation. But what we pointed out in paragraph 11 is that the priority

512
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:35,190
under the scheme is for those people who are grossly under accommodated, but it doesn't stop other people who are on that marginal 7 7.5 from applying and we will consider their application, but again.

513
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:42,920
We have to prioritise, and the priority must be given to those people who are in a worse situation than the one you describe. I think that's entirely rational.

514
01:35:43,200 --> 01:36:03,210
No, I don't think it's rational at all because I try to apply for them, but it's not successful. Since and the reason given is not that they are marginal, but it's just that they are not meeting the criteria of seven square metre per person. Because and it's really absurd that you design the house in twenty twenty one.

515
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:23,220
more than twenty twenty one point one or twenty one point one, I mean twenty one square metre. So the wind derived free is always less than seven, not more than seven. So they can never successfully apply. Of course, can you change the one, the twenty one to twenty two then?

516
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:43,230
In fact, then they immediately can apply. It has been changed over time. Previously, the ratio was lower than 21, and it has already been increased. We do review it from time to time again to reflect circumstances. So I don't disagree with you, but I'm afraid it is rational to have to allocate things against the worst.

517
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:50,280
people first, the less worst-off people second. That's the way it works. That's a rational approach.

518
01:36:51,010 --> 01:37:11,020
噉啊，本嚟應該到逃緊新源，不過佢唔喺度。噉我哋而家跟住咧係有逢檢機遇逃緊新源，排翻後面先。係誒，主席誒，我四個問，三個問題，我可唔可以簡單講誒？官官員都可以簡單答。第一個就關於輪候嘅學培公屋嗰個情況。而家我哋睇到咧就政府有四政府嘅職員咧，即係房屋署。

519
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:17,430
職員咧有四個方法咧，係令到排隊嘅人咧係遲過應該上樓嘅時間。

520
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:37,720
第一個方法咧就係我今日申請咧，通常要三個月到，甚至有啲係半年咧先攞到藍卡。咁呢個就變咗攞到佢計佢排隊嗰日咧，就攞藍卡嗰個印嗰個日子先算嘅。之前嗰啲佢哋唔計嘅，而好多時咧就係誒你哋啲職員咧就同呢人講，你又唔夠呢份文件，唔夠嗰份文件。

521
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:45,910
但係又唔係一次過話曬畀人聽咧，係佢欠幾多份？而每次話佢欠一份，於是佢欠十份嘅話，就去咗房屋處十次。

522
01:37:46,500 --> 01:38:00,100
呢個第一個方法係令到嗰條隊咧就縮減咗。第二個方法咧就配屋古畫。我試過街坊咧配屋畀佢咧，係你自己地區嘅村職員話畀佢聽，呢間屋以前有人吊頸嘅死咗嘅咩嘅卡。

523
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:20,560
咁啲街話：哇，噉樣我唔要啊啲空屋噉樣。其實空屋就唔應該配畀佢。首先你呢個空屋就唔應該配畀人先，佢係輪候嚟嘅，佢唔係突快嗰種。咁跟住咧又要畀等第二等下次配啦。佢話明我嗱呢次唔計啦，唔算你啦。但下一次幾耐咧？係十個月後啊，即係其實第一次，因為你配咗個錯配嘅屋畀佢之後咧。

524
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:40,580
你要佢等多十個月，令到佢個排啲，其實就挨多十個月。呢個第二個，你哋嘅方用緊方法。第三個，你哋用緊方法咧，就第一次同第二次嘅差距就好耐。以往咧，誒九七啱啱過咗嗰嗰嗰嗰五七年咧，即係董生嗰年咧，第一次同第二次嘅配咧，就係兩誒三個月到嘅啫，即係半。

525
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:51,400
年應該配製三次，而家要兩年先配製三次，即係第一次配屋一月，第二次配屋咧同年嘅十二月，第三次配屋下另外一年嘅十二月。

526
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,030
以往咧就係一月、三月、六月。

527
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:08,190
咁呢個差距咧，亦令到嗰個咧，其實你話成日都話我我係計計第一次嘅啫，我唔計你第二、第三次。咁但係對嗰個輪候嘅人咧，我原來排五年先排到市區，到真係我入火時係七年。

528
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:28,770
第四個古惑咧，就係嗰個茶入息。以往你哋話畀我哋聽咧，即係以往嗰個入茶個入息咧，係約有效期係半年嘅。即係我今日查你咧，半年之後我唔再查你，即係假設半年個變動比較少。但係因為你而家個配屋咧，第一次配咗畀佢之後，佢下次配屋咧係差唔多一年，即係十個月到一年先至配第二。

529
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,340
次，於是第二次咧，又要查多一次。

530
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,360
咁即係你配三次，查三次。

531
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:53,770
嗱，呢四個誹謗招咧，就係對輪候人士嘅唔公平嘅情況。呢個第一個我要提問。第二個提問係十三段，阿阿人就講咗七個七尺嗰個七平方米啦，我就挑挑戰你五點五啊，五點五叫擠迫家庭六十尺，而你個擠迫係講緊連廁所啊、廚房啊、騎樓都計埋曬入去嘅五點五，即係六十。

532
01:39:53,770 --> 01:40:05,230
尺以下先叫擠迫，呢個數字咧用咗，如果我冇記錯咧，成十幾廿年呢個字，呢個數字五點應該要改。不過我估你一定肯改嘅，因為你冇屋，你都冇屋。

533
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:13,820
個問題就因為屋起得屋少咧，就導致所有嘢都都唔變，所有嘢都維持現狀，所仲有你仲想收緊啲添。

534
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,280
第三個題目咧就係高齡。

535
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:36,570
嗰個我上次講到好似高齡公屋嗰啲，我哋文列提過，畀三四十年以上嘅樓齡咧，就應該要排隊拆嘅。特別喺嗰啲係誒早期嘅公屋咧，誒三十年嗰啲通常係十幾係十幾層樓，甚至乎有幾條村都係十四層、十五層。噉你拆咗佢再起翻咧，可以三十層。

536
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:56,580
三十五層係我哋計嗰條數咧，起碼多一倍半嘅樓，即係一千個單位咧變成二千五。咁點解到今日政府都唔可以拍即係有啲有啲魄力，即係做呢個重建咧？當日啊，麥理浩嚟到香港冇幾耐，都願意做一個係舊區重建清拆，就係所有細字區，佢都冇計到每一。

537
01:40:56,580 --> 01:41:09,350
地方當時都有地，但係都做得到出嚟。點解我哋而家都唔肯做？我哋冇條件做咧。誒，你咧就冇留時間畀我。第二次佢走啦嚇，你第二次嘅時候等佢答啦。誒，跟住係梁耀忠議員。

538
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:31,590
即即其實咧，我覺得咧就誒成個嘅誒公共房屋裏邊嚟講話咧，大家都要擺一啲嘅主同埋次嘅。噉係咩叫主同埋次咧？特別咧，我覺得咧係公共公屋咧嗰個嘅興建咧，同埋嗰個嘅誒騰誒，即即誒幫助輪候公屋嘅人咧係重要。

539
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:34,340
係居屋嘅，我只覺得嚟講係。

540
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:53,930
咁咧，但係不過咧就誒好遺憾啦嚇，即係而家房委會咧就即係完全冇諮詢底下咧，竟然間會將一啲嘅公屋單位咧係冇諮詢過任何人士或者公眾咧，係將佢轉為呢個居屋而出售，噉我覺得係呢個非常非常之唔恰當嘅做法嚟嘅。

541
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:59,970
咁呢個事件咧就係，即係例如一個嘅個案咧，就喺一個大澳嘅農田村。

542
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,100
有一座樓叫天地樓。

543
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:07,670
竟然間咧，房屋署咧係將佢得八十六個單位。

544
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:15,890
而家有十四户住緊嘅公屋居民咧，佢改人走，將佢改成為一個叫居屋而出售。

545
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:26,310
仲要時間上都要喺今年八月咧，要趕人走，而家就冇任何補償喎，只係有即係即係即係一個好簡單嘅嗰啲重建搬遷嘅津貼畀人哋嘅啫。

546
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:32,310
一個好唔合理、好唔即係我覺得仲唔人道嘅做法咧，幾然間會係即係出現咗出嚟。

547
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:34,610
咁咧就。

548
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:54,900
房委會咧就話咧，即係因為佢係即係有八十六個單位啦，咁誒即係有八十五個單位咧就可以出嚟咧誒，畀人買畀人哋嘅。咁一個就我係行政上高，咁其實八十五減翻十四個嘅話咧，有得七十一，因為你十四個都要畀佢入翻入住翻公誒公誒公屋㗎嘛，係咪？噉佢竟然間。

549
01:42:54,900 --> 01:43:11,280
七十一個嘅單位嘅人喺海外出嚟去賣，咁變咗嚟講話咧，究竟我哋個政策上高係畀一個嘅公屋輪候嘅人為重要啲啊，還是係畀人買居為重要咧？

550
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:15,180
就算啊，依七十一個單位。

551
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:21,150
畀曬公屋居民買曬都好，你騰出嚟咧，即係七十一個公屋單位啫。

552
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:35,990
而況且你唔係完全咧，係即係畀曬公屋居民買曬，仲係畀一啲嘅出邊即係私人樓宇啲人買添。咁有乜好處咧？咁所以我問一問咧，房屋署或者房委會咧，究竟你嘅方針？

553
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:37,180
擺邊度？

554
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,220
擺重喺一個嘅。

555
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:45,990
解決公屋輪候拆嘅居民啦，還是係解決啲人置業買屋咧？

556
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:47,540
啊，白酒一張。

557
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:54,630
That's a very interesting case that that the honourable members talked about. The the trouble is nobody wants to move to Tai O.

558
01:43:54,970 --> 01:44:14,980
We have these units, we've had them on the list. We've got spare units in other blocks out there. It's just not rational to keep hanging on to them without they're being used. It's it's just a waste of resources. We know because we have sold HOS units in Tai O in the past. People are prepared to buy to buy HOS units out there. So.

559
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:20,170
This comes down to the assessment that, in terms of the best use of those resources.

560
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:40,580
Should I just sit on 80 odd units, which nobody is going to apply for as PRH, or should we convert them to HOS? And we've taken a view that we should convert them. Now, to talk about the the people that will be displaced, the reason that we've been able to look at this is that all of those people could be reaccommodated within the Tai O area. That's the first principle.

561
01:44:40,580 --> 01:45:00,590
They have to be basically moved next door if you want, but of course they will have priority to buy the HOS units if they wish to. That's also provided for, and indeed other people in Tyer will have the same opportunity. So it's a difficult one. I agree, the priority if it was possible to use them for PRH, I would do so. But frankly, the people just not interested in.

562
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:06,280
moving out there, the cost of transportation, the the remote location and so on and so forth.

563
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:13,460
Indeed, we have a number of interim housing units out there. Again, not very popular. So it's a very difficult one. This one.

564
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:34,700
誒跟住誒副主席，謝偉全議員誒多謝主席。誒主席，我想跟進翻我剛才第一輪嗰陣時咧，即係第一個文件嘅問問題，關於咧即係頭先局長咧確認咗話，即係誒嗰個羣組方面嗰啲數據咧就係非常重要。噉啊，一啲預測亦都。

565
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:54,710
重要噉，我唔知而家有冇啲數據咧，即係包括即係話嗰啲羣組，即係調查咗人數啊、收入啊、居住情況啊，估計未來五年、十年、十五年嗰個情況係點樣啊？呢啲數據個督導委員會而家有冇咧？如果有，可唔可以畀我哋呢個小組去誒參考咧？咁呢個第一樣要跟進，第二樣。

566
01:45:54,710 --> 01:46:14,720
樣嘢咧，我想問下誒呢個誒長遠房屋策略督導委員會咧嚇，佢有冇誒負責去睇一睇？頭先我講過㗎啦，即係誒除咗而家政府喺房屋供應方面扮演角色啦嚇，即係喺公屋啊同埋居屋之外咧，房協咧。

567
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:22,450
未來嗰個角色係咪會都係係提供呢個房屋方面咧？有誒考慮佢扮演咩角色咧？

568
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:38,040
咁另外咧，我都想講一講咧，就私人發展商，因為而傢俬人發展商咧喺個提供嗰個誒居住房屋方面咧，大家覺得咧就因為個價錢問題咧，其實好多都係香港嘅人咧都買唔到㗎啦。

569
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:51,970
噉啊，會唔會咧？即係用翻過往嚟講咧？誒，有公屋，有小居屋，但係仲有班人咧，根本咧就係全部咧，就係又賣唔到私人樓，誒，又唔合資格。

570
01:46:52,250 --> 01:47:01,140
咁呢方面咧，就係喺嗰個檢討，即係話呢個策略嗰方面咧，督導委員會會唔會都係包括埋睇呢啲嘢咧？唔該。

571
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:21,650
Mr. Chairman, we are trying to gather information in respect of the data in the first case. It's actually quite difficult because at best all we can get is a snapshot. You know, it's very difficult because family circumstances do change over time. But we are trying to gather that data. Yeah, yeah. That's why I said that. You know, there could be a constant review.

572
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:41,660
Exactly, I agree with you, and we must do that. I think that's absolutely right. On the second one, yes, of course, going forward, the housing department will will continue to have a very aggressive role in terms of both PRH and HOS production, and we are gearing up in terms of our staffing complement and so.

573
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:54,550
on to be able to increase our production to meet the challenge that we've been placed by the chief executive to increase and speed up production. So we will we will continue on that. The third one.

574
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:03,350
the the issue of private developers' involvement in the production of housing, of course.

575
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:20,480
政府已經宣佈，它的承諾將會是生產足夠的土地，為20,000個單位每年，由私人發展商生產。這基於過去的平均佔用，長遠期間，也就是10到15年。

576
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:29,640
我 understand that again, governments also announced that over the next four years, some sixty-seven thousand units should be produced. So

577
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:50,260
already underway。對唔住啊，主席，我因為想問個問題啫，即係因為數據嗰度咧，你有冇時間大概幾時會即係有？即係就算點樣情況咧，有啲，因為呢個好緊要嘅，其實嗰個督導委員都需要。誒，最尾講個誒私人發展商嗰度咧，其實即係我最主要咧就話有一班。

578
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:56,220
其實佢買唔起私人樓，又唔合資格住誒居屋或者公屋，嗰班會唔會考慮？

579
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:16,990
Well, that's a that's why the the solution to housing long term is to provide more supply. Because at the moment there's an imbalance between demand and supply. For many reasons we don't have to get into. We don't have time. But the the solution must be to increase the supply, not just in the public housing sector which we're doing, but also in the

580
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:22,900
呢個明白，其他數字幾時會有咧？啊，你繼續啊！

581
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:34,280
Well, as I say, we're we're trying to gather those figures at the moment. The figures on the inadequately housed should be, I think, ready by May. That's the sort of time frame that we're talking about.

582
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,420
家姐。

583
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:55,710
誒接住係田北辰議員，咁咧就大家睇到咧，而家餘下時間咧就剩翻咧係六分鐘，噉我作為議員都未有時間問，咁因係啊，我哋係咪可以延十五分鐘？咁希望大家同意我哋呢個會議咧延多十五。

584
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:58,190
分鐘好嘛？噉就。

585
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,190
誒第一輪咧就仲有民眾報名。

586
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:11,160
有冇咧？就係田北辰與問完到我，然後畀第二輪咧，仲有張超雄、馮檢基嚇，噉啊，田北辰與。

587
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:22,880
喂，有冇人問到呢個誒庫政策嗰個嗰啲入息啊資產上限啊？你問啦。啊，我想問一問咧，就係。

588
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:31,700
嗱，我所理解，譬如話你而家市面有啲四五百尺嘅單位咧，好似美孚啲青麗苑啊、沙田啲河畔花園、花園城噉樣。

589
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:34,970
而家大約今日都係賣三百三萬到。

590
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:46,110
如果你保守呢度七成按揭啊，即係已經好保守㗎啦。噉你又交大約係九啊九萬首期，就每個月供大約萬一蚊到嘅。

591
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:59,490
咁如果我保守啲，用公誒樓係作為入息嘅三成半啦，嚇都唔去到政府話咩四成五成咯。三成半嘅話咧，理應一個家庭咧。

592
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:02,450
如果具有入息三萬二。

593
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:05,010
佢資產有一百萬。

594
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:20,840
都已經可以啊，去買一個噉嘅單位啦。咁呢個係今日已經即係巔峯嘅市價啦。噉我睇翻佢而家呢個庫碗呢個表咧，係二人家庭嘅入息限額都係四萬。

595
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:25,970
資產限額就一百一十三萬。

596
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:33,710
噉你四百尺，其實而家出邊都有人住，可能即係都唔係淨係兩個人㗎啦，都可能三個咁㗎啦。

597
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:44,760
咁即係我想明白下呢個噉嘅庫房政策，呢啲噉嘅上限，仲係十年之內都唔去睇過，係十年之後先睇嘅喎。啲數據係點計出嚟嘅咧？

598
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:46,340
必須。

599
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:47,580
嗯。

600
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:54,280
Mr. Chairman, the limits are reviewed every year. The

601
01:51:55,010 --> 01:52:02,050
In fact, if I refer you to Annex B of the paper, it sets out the limits as they are currently.

602
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:09,460
The issue I think is that we're looking at entitlement for public rental housing, with the emphasis on rental.

603
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:13,550
We think that if someone is eighty-four times.

604
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:26,860
over the asset limit prescribed for the net asset limit prescribed for public rental housing, and also exceeds the income limit, they should be able to be in a position to buy some sort of accommodation in the private sector.

605
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:48,040
And that's why we do enforce those limits. But eighty four percent, sorry, eighty four times, not eighty four percent, eighty four times over the asset limit is a substantial amount. It really is. No, no, I'm questioning whether they're too high. That's my point. Yeah, the example that I cited, Duncan, the example that I.

606
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:48,940
我 cites。

607
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:54,760
somebody can actually buy a flat, a 3.3 million dollar flat.

608
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:59,630
with 70% mortgage, which is very conservative.

609
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:07,350
Alright, and if you take thirty five percent of their annual income as mortgage payment.

610
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:26,830
The limit should be thirty-two thousand monthly income and then one million dollar for for the down payment of the flat, which are much lower than all these numbers. So are we not allowing too many people that can afford to go buy private housing to stay in our public housing system?

611
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:36,690
I think the numbers are not that substantial, to be honest with you. If you look at the the figures we're talking about, we we have people.

612
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:57,330
of about two thousand six hundred out of a total of seven hundred and fifty thousand. So the proportion is actually very very small that are paying the full rent and therefore have to move out. The numbers are very small. I think the current numbers are not unreasonable. Having said that, we do keep them under review and it's something.

613
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:17,340
That we also will reflect back to the long term housing. Yes. Can you please promise to look into whether these numbers actually are relevant to the current situation? Because there's so many people out there that couldn't get into public housing, that have no asset and income much lower. Yeah. No, I accept that. Some of these people should move out and buy their own.

614
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,550
Private housing, so please review these numbers.

615
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:26,240
啊！時間咧就到啦，咁而家咧就係到。

616
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:30,160
誒，我作為議員咧，用我四分鐘。

617
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,520
就。

618
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:36,630
我咧就希望咧就誒當局咧就著。

619
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,360
計分制。

620
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:47,200
係作為一個獨立個項目咧，嚟去提交誒文件咧，一個議題咧嚟去討論呢個次期一。

621
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:53,120
第二咧，我亦都希望咧，當局咧就著呢個副政策。

622
01:54:53,440 --> 01:55:03,990
負所謂嘅負政策，亦都咧係就著一個獨立嘅討論咧，嚟去係喺翻呢個誒委員會度去傾。

623
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:12,370
因為事實上面咧，我覺得咧，呢兩個方面咧都好多問題，呢個我嘅嘅意見要求。

624
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:17,420
誒，我而家想提出嘅問題咧，就係。

625
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,640
你講。

626
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,820
房屋協會咧。

627
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:27,100
誒嗰個作用咧，似乎喺呢份文件裏面咧，就係完全都冇提及。

628
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:38,370
呢份文件咧，只係講咧就係誒房屋委員會、房屋署核下嘅公營房屋嗰個係點樣合理資源運用。

629
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:49,240
咁大家睇到咧，就係有好多咧喺嗰個申請呢個租住公屋嘅時候咧，係未必合資格，而喺邊緣嗰部分。

630
01:55:49,520 --> 01:56:06,000
咁過往歷屆政府都會運用咧房屋協會作為咧係佢哋提供咧係另一類嘅公營房屋，係幫助一啲咧過往我哋講咧係即係中產個部分。

631
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:10,830
都係其當然，而家個中產嘅含義，佢會係不斷變化啦。

632
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:30,030
咁以往咧，房屋協會咧都發揮咧係提供呢個畀呢一部分中產亦都需要咧係申請入住呢個誒租金比較平，而佢又租唔起私人樓嘅呢部分居民。

633
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:45,410
但係而家我似乎咧睇唔到啦，就政府咧喺呢方面咧係有政策有措施增加房屋協會喺呢個租住呢個較低廉房屋供應。

634
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:47,160
呢個安排。

635
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:54,060
即使誒新一屆政府亦都係講咧，佢而家所謂增建公屋。

636
01:56:54,340 --> 01:57:14,350
誒五年後去到十萬都係講緊咧，房委會同埋房屋署核下嘅公營房屋，但點解唔可以考慮埋唔唔可點解唔計劃埋畀誒房屋協會咧？都喺呢方面扮演一個咧係更積極嘅角色咧。

637
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:17,930
咁呢兩部分嘅問題，我希望聽到誒。

638
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:19,420
秘書長嘅回應。

639
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:39,040
Mr. Chen, we can we can certainly come back with a couple of papers as you suggest. We'll do that at a future meeting. On the housing society, the the housing society, as I described earlier, really provides a wider range of

640
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:49,440
different types of housing beyond public rental housing and home ownership scheme, they are involved in in in in

641
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,570
on a sort of a

642
01:57:51,880 --> 01:58:01,200
一 wide range of programmes. For example, they've been working with the Urban Renewal Authority to do flats for sale schemes.

643
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:21,490
They've helped government out through the Greenview Villa scheme, so they will always continue to provide supplementary numbers of units. But they'll never be in the same sort of mass production range as the Housing Department and the Housing Authority. They're always going to be because of their capacity, because of their size. They're not going to be producing tens of thousands.

644
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:41,590
They're only going to be able to produce a few thousand at any one time, but they're a very useful resource because they can trial out different types of housing that perhaps the housing authority doesn't have the capacity to do, and that's where things like housing for the elderly, the send schemes come in. Those they will continue to do。我我嘅意思咧就。

645
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:42,190
係。

646
01:58:42,470 --> 01:59:02,480
我建議同埋我嘅批評咧，就係話政府係考慮發展進一步加碼咧，喺個公營出租公屋嗰度咧，完全係冇計劃畀房屋協會咧係發揮進一步嘅作用。所以我希望你哋將翻你嘅意見咧係帶翻去畀長策。

647
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:06,670
小組咧，誒考慮好嘛？咁而家咧個時間咧。

648
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,970
第一輪就完啦，而家第二輪咧就有三位同事咧報咗名。

649
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:18,680
睇下仲有冇同事要報名，因為我哋咧個會場咧最多去到四十五分，一定完結。

650
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:22,400
而家報嘅名有張超雄、馮檢基、梁耀忠。

651
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:42,690
冇啦嘛，噉啊，仍然係四分鐘。咁講完咧就差唔多啦。噉啊，張超雄議員四分鐘連問連答。多謝主席。係。多謝主席嚇。頭先我提到特首嗰個政綱，其實亦都可以話係佢對市民一個承諾嚟嘅。佢講得好清楚，三十五歲以上嘅單身人士。

652
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:52,010
申領申請公屋咧，嗰輪候期應該同一般申請者拍齊，即係去到平均輪候期係三年。

653
01:59:52,290 --> 02:00:06,900
噉我頭先問常備有咩嘢策略，有咩具體措施去實踐呢個特首嘅政綱？佢係完全答唔到，完全係即係話唔評論。噉我覺得呢點咧係不能接受。

654
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:27,190
誒，我希望佢一定要跟進，而佢有個責任，即係要提出具體嘅措施，去睇下究竟呢個措施係點樣樣可以，即係能夠有效咁幫到一啲有需要嘅人咧，係及早係得到一個公屋嘅單位。咁喺呢個文件嘅附件。

655
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:35,700
第七段、第八段咧，就講到喺申請輪候嘅期間咧，有相當嘅住户係被凍結嘅。

656
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:42,270
咁五千幾户被凍結裏邊咧，其實絕大部分咧係因為居港年期嘅規定。

657
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:53,620
噉佢亦都顯示，雖然多次放寬咧，但係其實仍然有呢個五千幾户係有需要符合公屋資格，但係而家上唔到樓。

658
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:58,860
我想問咧，其實呢五千幾户裏邊有幾多係單親家庭？

659
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:07,810
我相信佢哋好多咧，而家亦都係住緊劏房。正如我頭先提到，三十五歲以上嘅單身人士嗰批咧，亦都係住緊喺劏房入邊。

660
02:01:08,090 --> 02:01:23,080
我想問政府，常備有冇考慮放寬，讓呢啲單親家庭係及早上樓，而唔需要凍結佢哋，因為佢哋好明顯有需要，而且裏邊牽涉到好多係小朋友。

661
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:34,690
係咪可以及早即係豁免呢個所謂誒居港七年嘅年限，讓呢五千幾户，我唔知道裏邊有幾多單親，希望佢達唔達，係及早上樓。李處長。

662
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:45,950
Mr. Chairman, I've commented in detail about the Seas Manifesto to say it is a long-term manifesto commitment, and it is appropriate for the LTHS to look at it.

663
02:01:46,240 --> 02:02:06,250
That's it. I'm not going to comment further on it because it must be for the LTHS to look at long-term commitments. So I can't really say very much more on that. In terms of the frozen numbers, there, as we've described in Annex A, paragraph seven, there are various reasons, and indeed one.

664
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:24,030
One of the the tasks that we've given to the the team that's looking into subdivided units is to investigate the nature of those people, because I think it is absolutely right that we need to understand the circumstances that people are in. Frozen households, on the others on the other hand, they are the people that come to us.

665
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:35,120
And say, look, I don't want my name to come off the waiting list because obviously that's to my disadvantage. But I understand that I'm not eligible for whatever reason. Sometimes they go to prison.

666
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:54,840
Clearly, they they're not going to be able to use a public rental housing unit. Sometimes they're put into hospital for long-term care. They still want to be on the waiting list. Sometimes they're waiting for family reunion purposes, and quite a few of these people are actually waiting for family reunion. In other words, they say the the father has applied.

667
02:02:55,650 --> 02:03:06,340
as a family, but the rest of the family comes in and he knows that his chances are higher as it comes in. and yes, there are numbers that are single parents, for example.

668
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:19,860
It's unusual for a single parent to come to us and ask us to freeze their application, because there's no advantage to them to do to do so. And we would say, well, why would you do that? Because if you're on the waiting list,

669
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:22,090
你 may as well continue.

670
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:42,440
所以你 become eligible， the only time is is when less than 50% of the household has achieved the seven-year residency， and that's where these are issues that have to be looked at。主席，主席，你可唔可以請因為會後提供一個數字？誒，我希望就我頭先問得好具體嘅。知道誒，我我。

671
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:53,750
咁希望政府你提供嗰啲資料，因為啊，商用語問都係好具體，唔重複啦，好嘛嚇？阿馮檢基員，因為要我先問，我就講咗問題嘅，等你答啫。

672
02:03:54,790 --> 02:04:03,660
誒頭先馮建基問嘅問題你未答四個問題嘅啊，秘書長你又而家答啦。

673
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:14,440
I don't want him to repeat it. Yeah, he asked four questions, of which the first question had four parts. Let me just deal with the first the first elements.

674
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:34,990
The date on which someone gets their blue card, as he mentioned, obviously depends on when we get all the documentation. We give applicants a very clear notice as to what documentation we require. It must be for them to comply with the documentation. We can't speed them up. If they don't have the documentation, how can we process? So I think that there's not much I can do.

675
02:04:34,990 --> 02:04:41,800
on the documentation side, in terms of the haunted flats, the so-called haunted flats, which is the second point.

676
02:04:42,190 --> 02:05:02,200
We do not deliberately allocate a particular flat to a particular family. The allocation is done by random selection, and if it comes up as a haunted flat, we have to tell them. We know because so many experiences in the past where we've offered a flat, there has been an incident. It doesn't have to be a suicide.

677
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:05,300
或，你知唔知，殺人或乜嘢，可以係某啲嘢。

678
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:25,620
maybe next to a refuse room or something, they very very quickly find out. So we must provide that information. I personally would argue we shouldn't provide that information. If someone's have something's happened in the past, doesn't mean it'll happen in the future. But I'm afraid our clients don't accept that. So we have no choice on these sort of flats. We

679
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:26,650
要講，

680
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:34,130
the the three offers we do try to give three offers as quickly as we can, but of course, as you know.

681
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:41,910
It depends on circumstances. Sometimes our production is predominantly in the urban area. Sometimes it's predominantly new territories.

682
02:05:42,290 --> 02:06:02,300
people tend to prefer the urban area. If we don't have enough units in an urban area to be able to offer the second offer, they still simply have to wait. We can't control that. It just depends on the number of units available at any one time, and people you know prefer newer units to older units because we can sometimes offer older units, but then it comes back into this problem of.

683
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:21,000
what's happened in the unit, so that one's a bit difficult. In terms of the income investigations, we do have to keep the income and asset situation under review because it does change over time. We think six months is a reasonable period, so that's the answer I think to the first point. On the second one.

684
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:41,290
The IFA, if you refer to Annex C of the paper, I think it's Annex C, the the information about the IFA, it's not, it is based on an average. But if you look at the the table at the end of paragraph one in Annex C, we do.

685
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:53,030
Set out the numbers, and it varies. I mean, for six persons, it's seventy-one square metre at IFA. So we do take into account the circumstances of the individual family and applicants.

686
02:06:53,340 --> 02:07:00,220
redevelopment， I want to talk about redevelopment because it is actually an active part of our existing programme.

687
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:05,280
The redevelopment requirements criteria are first.

688
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:22,360
the age and physical structure of the building. Secondly, do we have decanting accommodation suitable in the locality nearby or within the same district to re to accommodate all those people that will be have to be rehoused? Because bear in mind, even in an old estate.

689
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:42,650
八十或九十% Occupation，means we may have four or five thousand families to rehouse. We need to be able to rehouse them. The third criterion then is， can we get a development gain? Now we announced packs in recently where we could get a development gain of about two and a half to three thousand units. It's worth doing， but in some cases。

690
02:07:42,650 --> 02:08:02,660
because of changes in outline zoning plan on plot ratios, where they, for example, have previously may have had at eight, but they now reduced that to five, we can't get a gain, or because of other constraints. So these are the factors that we try to look at. But it is we have an aggressive programme, and I can say I have a special team in the housing department doing a review of our older

691
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:05,730
States and we'll announce those in due course through the HA.

692
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:26,020
誒，阿梁業中議員三分鐘啦，因為夠鐘㗎啦。三分鐘。主席，我唔係想係講嗰個嘅大澳嘅個案，但係不過咧，就我都想講講咧，居民咧係強烈反對嘅。最主要原因咧就係嗰嗰座大廈咧，其實咧係停咗六年咧係編配外界嘅人入佢嗰度住嘅。因為點解咧？因為要考慮咧會唔會？

693
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:46,030
將佢變成為青年誒旅館嘅噉，所以變咗咧停咗，唔畀人入去住。依個第一個問題。第二問題咧就係咧就唔單止嗰座大廈咧就係住唔滿嘅，其他座大廈咧都住唔滿嘅。咁可能亦都係啱嘅，就係因為太偏遠啦噉樣。咁所以如果我哋咁多人喺度輪候緊公屋嘅話咧，點解政府唔能？

694
02:08:46,030 --> 02:09:06,040
諗一諗，好似以前天水圍噉樣樣，用特殊嘅編配嘅方式去吸引佢哋入去嗰度住咧，而好過花成五千幾萬去改裝嗰座大廈咧，成為居誒居屋而賣畀人哋買畀人嗰啲人咧，通常嗰啲居屋咧唔係有人住嘅，佢裝係誒依個嘅誒咩誒誒誒。

695
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:26,050
誒誒，道格屋啊，嚟到去住嘅，噉你嘥嘥咗佢咧，畀人講係噉，所以我覺得咧，即係誒，可唔可以政府重新諗一諗呢啲大澳偏遠嘅一啲嘅公屋單位，如果唔係咁多人住嘅話咧，入即係願意入住嘅話咧，你係用一種特殊嘅編配方式，包括咗以前天水圍，譬如。

696
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:36,490
畀大啲單位畀佢啊！誒，畀一啲優惠啲畀佢咧，點入住而而係減輕嗰個輪候公嗰個嘅長度啊！畀住長，嗯。

697
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:57,220
already have that policy for the rural public housing flats in Tai O, but as you know there are still vacancies. It really is very difficult to get people to go out there. But we're prepared to look at any opportunity. But we do have a number of vacant flats, even not within the block that we're targeting. Having said that, I think it is appropriate when there is demand for HO.

698
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:17,230
和我們可以見到有60,000申請，綠色觀景屋，這更或等於，和69,000申請白色屋，如果我們能夠生產HOS單位來滿足這需求，我認為這是適當嘅嘗試。所以，正如我之前所講，這是一個非常困難嘅平衡，我們必須要達成。主席，即係我。

699
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:37,240
我覺得咧就係咩居民就好強力反對㗎啦。但係不過咧，就我覺得即係你應該諗翻頭先我講嘅個方式，用天水圍引一啲嘅居民入住嗰度嗰個模式去做，而唔係咧好似而家嘅編配方法。而家編配方法當然啦，因為大家知道咧，大澳嗰個山長水遠啦，交通費又貴噉。

700
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:48,480
噉你點樣叫人入住咧？咁所以變咗咧，係應該有啲特殊優惠。等完天水圍嗰時都係有特殊嘅優惠嘅。噉你唔諗呢個？可否有特殊優惠打一陣啊？好嘛？可否有特殊優惠？

701
02:10:49,990 --> 02:11:10,000
Mr. Chairman, we'll look at it. I'm always prepared to look at it, but we have to be careful that we don't encourage people to get into TAO and then all they do is subsequently apply for a move because they're not satisfied with that accommodation. For example, we have the EFAS approach where people can get priority allocation for these units.

702
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:18,370
佢住咗廿幾年，廿幾年後啲人都唔想搬咯，就係。

703
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:38,870
誒嗱，咁希望就著嗰個個案，即係大號啦嚇，噉就當局再翻去睇睇，睇下考慮下樑業忠議員嗰個意見，你翻去再再睇睇。咁因為今日個會議時間都用盡啦，噉就而家去到第四就其他上，我相信都冇其他上啦。噉我哋個會咧就開呢。

704
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:40,070
多謝各位。

705
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:42,750
唔該曬。

706
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:46,570
嗰兩個月。

707
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,120
好。
