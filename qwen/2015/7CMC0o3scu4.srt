噉啊！

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,290

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,390
嗯。

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,200
冇其他提名。

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,370
啊，咁如果冇其他提名咧，噉就。

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,960
誒，我就多謝大家嚇。

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,350
想問問大家使唔使誒選副主席咧？

12

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,300
誒冇嗰個。

16

哦。

19
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:23,230
好，我哋今日疫情嘅第二項咧，就係同政府當局係誒舉行誒會議，噉就文件咧就有誒有四份五份咧，畀咗大家㗎啦啊！噉啊，今日出席會議嘅咧就有財經事務及副務局副秘書長。

20

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:51,020
仲有就係強制性公積金計劃管理局主管投資規管嘅姚尚敏女士。

25
00:02:51,580 --> 00:03:03,110
財經事務及庫務局助理首席助理秘書長、財經事務嘅何綺蓮女士，仲有就係律政司高級政府律師。

26
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,260
黎啟鵬先生，咁嚟。

27
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,770
咁誒，我想睇睇啊！

28
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:29,420
誒副秘書長係咪你哋有一個powerpoint想同我哋介紹？係誒主席，咁誒，我會首先就住嗰個條例嘅政策目標咧，同埋呢一個我哋所講嘅預設投資安排，即係前清誒核心基金嘅一啲細節咧，就係會向位誒各位委員咧，就係做一個簡單介紹嘅。

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:49,770
噉啊，首先一啲背景資料咧，其實我哋就喺二零一四年六月至九月咧，財經事務及服務局同埋強積金管理局咧就進行咗一個三個月嘅諮詢。噉我哋收到嘅意見咧，大部分都係支持咧，係推出呢一個核心基金嘅。咁喺二零一五年三月咧，我哋都將呢個公眾諮詢嘅結果咧去公佈，而喺

30
00:03:49,880 --> 00:04:09,890
誒七月咧就去咗立法會嘅財經事務委員會咧，就係簡介呢一個核心基金嘅立法建議嘅。咁亦都喺二零一五年嘅十一月咧，就向立法會咧係提交咗誒今日我哋會討論嘅二零一五年強制性公積金條例誒計劃修訂條例草案嘅。噉啊，我哋希望。

31
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:18,270
講咧就係話，如果嗰個啊呢一個條例可以獲得通過嘅話咧，就喺二零一六年年底咧，就係推出呢一個核心基金嘅。

32
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:39,210
咁或者講一講佢嗰個誒政策考慮啦。咁其實而家咧，我哋佢積金計劃嘅成員咧，佢哋參加個計劃嗰陣時咧，就有一個表畀佢填嘅。咁咧就係佢會可以作出一啲投資選擇，去選一啲基金啦。咁如果佢冇剔嘅話咧，咁即係佢冇作出一個選擇咧。喺而家咧就係話嗰個受託人咧就會自動幫佢咧。

33
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:59,220
係根據個受託人誒喺個計劃嘅一啲預設安預設安排咧，就將佢啲錢咧係或者個公款咧就擺落啊。受託人決定嘅預設安排。咁而家咧喺法例嗰度咧係冇就住呢啲噉嘅預設安排咧係作任何嘅規管嘅，咁即係係任由咧係受託人決定嘅個。

34
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:19,230
情況咧就係變咗，好似呢個圖噉，係五花八門。而家我哋強積金計劃咧係有三十八個計劃，而我哋睇到咧就係分佈呢啲誒，即係如果冇揀咧就會落咗嘅預設投資安排咧，係大概有呢幾種嘅。噉我想特別提一提咧，就係話其中有十二個計劃嘅預設安排咧，就係一個強。

35
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:37,050
積金嘅保守基金，咁簡單啲嚟講，呢個保守基金咧就即係將啲錢咧就係擺喺即係銀行做一個存款咁滯。咁所以個回報咧就係非常之即係不理想啦。咁如果睇翻即係過去十五年咧，呢一個基金嗰個平均回報咧每年即係零點八個percent嘅啫。

36
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:46,060
咁所以，對於一啲打工仔，佢唔識揀或者佢唔想作出一啲投資選擇嘅話咧，現有嘅安排咧就未必保障到佢哋嘅利益。

37
00:05:46,990 --> 00:06:07,000
咁所以，我哋而家推出呢一個誒核心基金嗰個目的咧，就係話誒一啲唔識揀或者唔想揀嘅計劃成員咧，佢可以唔使煩。我哋有一個咧係即係平衡咗各方面嘅考慮嘅一個預設安排。噉我哋喺個法例咧，其中一個誒新嘅規定咧，就係話每一個受託人咧都要係。

38
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:27,010
喺每一個強積金計劃之後咧，提供一套咧係高度劃一、同埋有收費管制嘅誒預設投資策略，即係呢個核心基金。噉我想強調咧，呢次係第一次咧，係喺呢個強積金計劃咧係引入呢個收費管制嘅。咁誒，所以而個法例咧要定明啦，如果嗰一啲計劃成員佢係冇作出。

39
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:34,990
任何投資安排咧，受託人咧係必須將佢嘅誒誒累進權益咧係投資喺呢個預設投資安排嘅。

40
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:55,950
咁誒呢個投誒預設投資誒誒個安排嗰個誒投資嘅原則咧，就兩大項。第一個咧就係採用咧係全球分散風險嘅投資策略啦，同埋第二咧就係隨住計劃成員嗰個年齡咧係逐步減低風險嘅投資策略。噉我哋點樣落實呢兩個投資策略咧？我就會加。

41
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,280
交畀強積金管理局啊，馬誠信先生咧，為我哋介紹一下嘅。好，啊，馬誠信先生。

42
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,520
多謝主席。

43
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:26,810
我會帶領成員們快速通過投資安排，來解釋如何將先生剛剛所解釋的原則實際上會被交付。根據這個建議，基本上，我們已經研究過很多種方法來實現風險降低和全球分散化，並已經制定了一個策略，該策略只使用兩個組成基金。所以，這是我們認為可能的最低數量。

44
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:35,380
to deliver this sort of strategy, and effectively there are different age points at which different things happen, and for most people up

45
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,270
誒。

46
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:56,560
And for most of their money and most of the time they're in the system, they would be in this core accumulation fund, as described on the slide here. So up until age fifty, all of the contributions and benefits of a person who are in the default investment strategy will be invested in this core accumulation fund. And as the graph indicates, the

47
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:07,970
This is predominantly higher risk assets, sixty percent higher risk assets and forty percent lower risk assets. And up until age fifty, none of the money will be in the other fund. The

48
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,720
2080 fund。

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,820
The opposite happens.

50
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,230
就係噉，但係。

51
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,400
When a person is over the age of sixty-five.

52
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:35,260
所以一個策略，那係被 devise for  people who are at the end of their working life and at retirement age， is that all of their money will be in this lower risk fund， where only twenty percent of the assets are exposed to higher risks， principly equities。所以那係那係相對簡單。The challenge

53
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:46,840
是how we move people from the higher risk exposure when they're under 50 to the lower risk exposure when they're 65. and so we need to reduce that gradually. and as this graph shows diagrammatically.

54
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:56,140
the the way we do this is to reduce this exposure every year, once a year, they'll slowly move money to the lower risk constituent fund.

55
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:18,320
This bar chart shows this in more detail. The way this will be done is that each year, from age from 50th birthday, some of the benefits will be moved out of the high risk fund, the core accumulation fund, and moved into the 65 plus fund on a consistent and gradual basis, so that at the member's 6

56
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:37,330
64歲生日，所有他們的福利將被投資在低風險基金，即係65歲以上基金。呢個係我們研究過的機制。有好多可能的機製作為做呢個，但係呢個係我們協議過的機制，係最有效率的，呢個風險減低可以達成。

57
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:58,410
The other important feature, as mentioned by Mr. Chong, is that there will be a statutory fee control. And in the legislation in Schedule 11, the figure contained there is 0.75% of net asset values on a daily basis. So this is a fee control that applies on an ongoing basis.

58
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:18,420
Assessed daily at on an annual figure of 0.75, so it's 0.75 divided by 365 for most years, of course. The important question, of course, is well, what does this cover? The consultations propose that the fee control would relate to the management fees, because this is the issue that's the main driver of total fee.

59
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:38,430
Outcomes, and we consulted in relation to how to control the management fees of these default investment strategies. The parties that that affects are those fees payable to the parties indicated on this slide. So obviously the trustee, who have an important role in relation to administering and trust.

60
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:53,350
trustee of the scheme, they are the key party. So obviously, there involved the administration. Often, trustee appointed administrator, that is a party who does the day-to-day control of money flows and information flows and data.

61
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:14,090
at the member level, so they sometimes appointed administrator, so it's important that that person also be covered because they're doing some of the trustees' functions in effect. The third party that is important to cover, of course, is the investment manager, the person who is responsible for making investment decisions on an ongoing basis. It's important that they're covered, so their their fees.

62
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:34,100
Are also covered within this cap. We've also included parties who are described as sponsors and promoters. In effect, these are the business owners who take some of the responsibility for distribution. For example, marketing is often the sort of activity they do. So their fees are also contained within this 0.75% fee cap.

63
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:43,960
And certain elements of the custodians' function, to the extent the custodians have a management-like fee, that is also captured within the proposed fee cap.

64
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,060
啊。

65
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,060
最 importantly， there's one box down the bottom， but actually most of the fee elements will actually be within this particular box， and that is。

66
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:13,130
The structure of MTF investment is such that most things don't actually happen at the constituent fund in investment sense. Most activity happens at underlying fund levels, so it's important that we uplift those same boxes above from underlying investments so that they are also captured within this 0.75%. So that that fee cap effectively captures all.

67
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:22,680
管理費，expenses， wherever it occurs through the structure and however the the scheme is structured. So that's the way the the fee cap is designed to capture all of those elements.

68
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,980
Moving on then to how this will look for the member perspective, the law does.

69
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:52,790
Bill proposal does include a requirement that the default investment strategy has to be made available to members. So not only will this apply in the primary case, that is where people don't make a choice, but the default investment strategy is also made available as a choice for members who want to choose it. And of course.

70
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,720
所有成員將被説明有關其可用性及其相對效益。

71
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:11,590
That they might consider. So the sort of choices that members will have in that environment is they can choose, they can tick the box on the form to to invest their money into the default investment strategy. So it is a deliberate choice.

72
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:31,880
因為的投資策略是構成兩個組成基金，那兩基金也會成為成員的選擇。所以當成員想要在可選的組成基金中做選擇時，這兩個新基金，即係核心積蓄基金和65歲以上基金，我提到的，也會成為成員的選擇。

73
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,540
所以圖解地，他們可以做那種 sort of choices。他們可以 either do nothing。

74
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:56,910
Not tick any boxes, in which case they will end up in the default investment strategy, or they can deliberately choose it, which has the same outcome, or they can make their choice from the range of existing and new constituent funds. So this doesn't in any way limit the ability of members to make choices. In fact, it expands their ability to make choices because there are some new options.

75
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:17,030
And it does respect the decisions that members want to make about their own investment choices. But we expect that for many members, they will find the attributes of this suitable for them. Or it is designed to deal with those members who just, for whatever reason, they don't want to, they don't know how to, or they forget to, or they just don't make.

76
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,360
Investment choice, and so the devolved investment strategy will apply to those people.

77
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,530
嗯。

78
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:44,820
Parts of the bill go into some arrangements about implementation and transition. The expectation that the bill commences by the end of two thousand and sixteen. There are some requirements set out in the bill about how this affects existing accounts. It's often the case.

79
00:14:44,820 --> 00:15:04,830
Setting up a new arrangement is easier than the actual dealing with the pre-existing. So we need arrangements to deal with. How does this affect existing accounts? And the way that will work is that providers will be given a period of six months after commencement to issue an opt-out notification to those people who are currently.

80
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,450
what we call default scheme members, those who are only invested in the current defaults.

81
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:25,380
那notice會say會tell the person that unless they do something within the forty-two day notification period, the trustee will move those benefits into the default investment strategy. So that's how that affects current accounts. So

82
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:44,240
this is what we're calling an opt-out approach that unless the member that particular member does something, then those benefits will in a period of 14 days after that notification period be moved into the default investment strategy, and accordingly that affects their subsequent contributions and benefits that go into the scheme.

83
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,810
There are a couple. Sorry, chairman. Okay.

84
00:15:50,090 --> 00:16:10,100
Thank you. There are a couple of small exceptions to that transition. I just mentioned that it won't apply to members who are 60 years of age or above, because we consider that the effort and approach of the transition isn't necessary for those members. And we also won't transition members where they're currently invested in a guarantee fund, if the guarantee is more

85
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,200
比他們會get if they moved.

86
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:34,680
The bill, of course, also contains all the usual provisions about regulation and supervision. Most importantly, these are these are just new funds and a new strategy within schemes. So all of our existing inspection and investigation powers will be equally applicable to the default investment strategy as for all current funds and all current strategies.

87
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:53,560
In particular, a new power there in relation to seeking requiring the trustee to provide an auditor's investigation report where the NPFA reasonably believes that there's non-compliance, but the usual audit obligations will also apply to this DIS. So that's one extra specific power.

88
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:15,720
And of course, the bill also contains proposals in relation to the consequences of non-compliance. And in essence, there are three consequences for failure to follow the requirements. That is, failure to have a DIS or failure to implement it in accordance with the regulations. And they are the possibility of revocation as an approved trustee, so that the trustees.

89
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,270
approve status could be revoked, or they could be suspended.

90
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:32,150
作為一個方案的管理人，所以他們的管理方案可以被暫停或終止，而且也有一係列的財務罰款將會適用於方案所包含的義務。

91
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,010
Chairman, as I indicated, the broad timing is that the bill has now been introduced.

92
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:57,000
If the bill can be commenced by the end of 2016, what that would mean is that the obligations in the law would kick off at that point, and that would mean that new money going into new accounts from that date would go into the DIS. That the

93
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:17,410
Constituent funds are available for selection by members, and also the default investment strategy itself is available for selection by members. Importantly, the law now contains a new obligation that trustees have to comply with the instructions by members. So, the extent that members instruct them to invest in the DIS or any other constituent fund, that is also an obligation that would apply.

94
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:30,510
and the intention is that on commencement of the bill, all of those obligations will start at the same point in time, and the intention is that occurs by the end of 2016, subject of course to members' views on the proposals.

95
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,080
That's by way of introduction, chairman. Oh, thank you.

96
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:44,590
誒睇下邊位議員有問題想問啦，噉啊，我哋登記下先，噉啊，有鄧家彪議員。

97
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,170
係善眾街議員坐邊位？

98
00:18:48,850 --> 00:19:08,860
暫時兩位，哦，啊，陳偉業議員，三位，好啊。噉我哋每位五分鐘啊，連問連答。啊，鄧家彪議員，啊，多謝主席。誒，即係誒，當然呢個核心基金誒討論咗都一段時間，即係我哋又好難。

99
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:28,870
對於嗰個落誒本身個本質咧，就即係有咩反對嘅，但係最驚咧雷聲大雨點雨點少，實在係冇乜效果。誒繼續咧挽回唔到咧市民對強積金嘅信心。當然勞工團體或者包括我咧，都係特別講啊，呢一筆唔作投資選擇嘅錢，可唔可以用？

100
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:48,880
公共受託人嘅形式集合起上嚟做一個嘅保證回報咧。既然I幫都搞得咯，你部保證跑及通脹咯。市民咧要追求高回報嘅噉啊，自己出去揀高風險高回報嗰啲。噉啊，如果想穩穩陣陣有個穩妥回報嘅核心基金。

101
00:19:48,880 --> 00:20:08,890
或者自新加坡嗰啲中央公積金係一個即係畀市民即係清晰而明嘅選擇，但係無可奈何咧，就財經公唔接受啦。誒，積金局可能同受託人傾咧，受託人繼續咧就吹到天咁大，或者表現好好啊，有競爭有進步啊。強積金市場都搞咗十五年啦，如果

102
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:17,430
有競爭，嗰個平均回報就唔會越嚟越低啦，三點六咋？就嚟整個平均回報輸通脹。

103
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:37,720
所以即係對於一個有收費管控嘅一個即係做法，我哋同意嘅。但係係咪全部對於呢一份即係條例草案嘅內容，我哋都係全盤照收咧？我哋要繼續研究。咁亦都好希望咧，主席可以安排咧，就關心強積金，無論係勞工團體，甚至係商界。

104
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:57,730
業界甚至係基金界別學者都希望有個聽證會，畀佢最後講一講，即係對於呢個條例草案意見。呢第一，第二咧就我知道，始終第一次會議好難咧，有具體即係每一條去睇。但係我諗主要就係關心四樣嘢啦嚇。第一樣嘢咧，個收費個收費即。

105
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:17,740
當然就零點七五，好似即係畀人個感覺好舒服啦。一係咧就低過一，但係咧就多次表述咧就話啊，希望中期咧可以達到即係F.E.R.即係嗰個資產嗰個啊啊收費值係一個percent。咁點解零點七五又一咧？個差距喺邊度咧？

106
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:37,750
唔係零點七五嘅咩？咁原來咧再睇條例，我唔知有冇睇錯，就係三十四D C裏面第三點所講，哇！設立基金嘅咧，原來就唔受收費管控嘅喎。誒咩保管人有關於即係投資維持投資或者轉移投資嗰個啲收費又唔？

107
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:57,190
包落個收費管控嘅喎，會唔會有好多咧冇羅列出嚟咧？唔包唔包唔包，根本零點七五係假嘅咧。希望就再多啲澄清，以及當然你透過附表咧就定一個零點七五，誒可唔可以講多啲有冇機制咧？你哋話長遠咧都想再調低，咁個機制係乜嘢咧？標準係咩咧？呢個第一點。

108
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:17,480
第二點咧個表現，個表現大家關心啦，即係你話啊，外國都好多例子啊，英國啊、瑞典咁外國係點樣嘅咧個例子，可唔可能講多啲一啲實際嘅表現，畀我哋議員對呢一個即係誒內容有一啲信心，就唔好話繼續交畀嗰十幾個受託人自己搞。

109
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,330
有競爭有進步，我哋真唔係好信嘅。咁究竟外國係點樣咧？你話採納外國，可唔可講啲外國實際回報嘅數字畀我哋聽下咧？

110
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:46,660
嗯，第三就係強積金嘅積金局嘅監管力度，始終都預設基金比起其他嘅，即係五百幾隻基金係應該係特別唔同嘅。經積金局監管嘅力度，當然我知罰則係重咗，但係個力度，你哋個權力會唔會再重啲咧？可唔可以有啲分別畀我哋聽下咧？

111
00:22:46,660 --> 00:23:06,670
第四個咧就係，如果整嚿嘢出咗台啦，究竟基金界或者係受託人會唔會不轉移、不宣傳啊？收埋呢隻可能對自己不利嘅，啲人繼續揀嗰啲誒收費兩個percent、一點幾個percent，我就將呢個零點七唔係收埋，唔做宣傳，唔好畀人知。

112
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:26,680
點樣防止佢哋做手腳，即係避免啲人揀咧？呢啲幾方面我都係好關心嘅。呢四方面即係個收費、一個表現、一個即係實施之後，究竟足售台嗰個即係啲行政，你點樣即係鼓勵到佢哋係做宣傳咧？以及積金局喺呢一個核心基金上面。

113
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:46,690
個監管力度會唔會對比其他五百幾隻監管嘅基金係有不同咧？呢啲都係我所關注嘅。而家剩翻四分幾鐘，我我暫時係咁多，我會有第二輪嘅。好一連串問題，不過咧，你就係提到嗰個公聽會咧，我哋就係有安排嘅，一間會宣佈。就其他問題就請誒睇下副秘書長。

114
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,210
答一個話係阿馬先生答。

115
00:23:49,930 --> 00:24:09,940
O.K.誒主席，我或者好簡單回應頭先嗰四個問題啦。嗯。噉啊，關於收費嗰度咧，其實我哋係誒要知道咧，我哋而家嗰個收費管制係係關於咧嗰個誒管理嗰個收費。咁頭先提到嗰個條文咧，三十四D.C.咧喺遲啲我哋誒逐條審議。

116
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:21,350
嗰陣時咧，我哋可以再詳細討論。但係我而家好簡單講一講咧，就係話呢一啲咧都係並非係啊喺嗰個嗯，我哋喺諮詢文件嗰度講咧係誒。

117
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:41,640
落咗去呢個管理嗰個費用嗰度，咁亦都係一啲咧係唔係誒以一個誒嗰個資產值咧係一個百分比咧而計算嘅一啲誒費用嚟嘅，咁所以咧我哋覺得係公平起見咧，呢一個咧係誒應該係抽出嚟嘅，咁但係咧唔代表咧就係話放生。

118
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:57,650
話畀人放生呢個業界，因為咧，其實喺其他嘅現行嘅一啲規管嗰度咧，已經係需要咧，佢係誒合理地收呢啲噉嘅費用。而呢個就係關係到咧頭先第二個問題，就係話嗰個監管力度誒。

119
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:18,000
呢一個咧係第一次誒，我哋係引入一個收費管制。咁喺收費管制嗰度咧，係已經係加多咗一啲誒監管嘅要求，例如咧就係話佢嘅誒受託人咧係需要提交一啲即係審核嘅帳目咧，係畀強積金管理局咧係知道咧，佢遵守咗呢一個嘅。

120
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,780
誒誒法例嘅要求嘅。

121
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:27,260
咁誒，所以可以保證咧，就係話監管力度咧係會有強，係誒會有加強，係唔會減弱。

122
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:47,550
噉啊，亦都係就係話受託人嗰方面。首先，我想講咧，就係話喺呢件事上邊咧，我哋唔係一個敵對嘅一個局面嚟嘅，因為其實我哋覺得係一個多贏嘅方案。誒，頭先議員係提得好好嘅，我哋想咧就係話市民咧對呢個強積金制度咧可以提高佢個信心。點解提高信心咧？好。

123
00:25:47,550 --> 00:26:07,560
好簡單，收費同埋回報啦，大家都知道。咁但係我哋要知道就係話，收費與回報中間係要做好多嘢先可以做到一個係大家都誒接受同埋理想嘅效果。頭先提到受託人會唔會係即係故意做一啲嘢令到市民唔揀、唔宣傳啊各樣嘢？誒，可以向大家講強積金。

124
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:16,480
管理局咧已經係開始係誒籌備，係點樣去大力宣傳呢一個誒投資安排？咁所以咧係誒。

125
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:36,770
計劃成員咧係唔會唔知，亦都係法例嗰度咧要求咧。因為佢今次推出呢一個誒誒核心基金咧，佢一定要改佢嗰啲文件嘅。咁喺改啲文件咧，法例已經要求咧，佢必定咧係要書面通知所有嘅計劃成員嘅。咁最後一個外國安排啦。咁誒，其實喺澳洲啊，或者～

126
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:56,780
喺喺誒英國啊，同埋呢一個瑞典咧，都有類似一啲核心基金嘅一啲誒噉嘅安排嘅。咁其實喺歐盟咧，整個歐盟咧喺最近幾年咧，亦都係做咗一啲研究啦，係希望咧係即係做一啲改善嘅。全世界都係做緊同一樣嘅嘢。個問題點咧，就係話唔識揀，唔

127
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:14,660
想揀呢一個噉嘅情況咧，唔係香港獨有嘅，全世界好多呢啲類似嘅計劃咧，嗰啲計劃成員咧都係面對一個問題，係都係唔識揀唔想揀，咁所以點解各地嘅政府同埋監管機構咧都係改善緊呢個預設安排？咁講到誒嗰個投資嗰個誒。

128
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:35,060
安排咧，其實喺外國嘅咧，大部分都係用一個即係環球分散風險，同埋係逐步降低風險、隨年齡逐步降低風險呢兩個投資嘅誒誒原則去做嘅。咁回報嗰方面咧，我手頭上咧就冇資料，咁但係喺相關嘅誒誒網頁嗰度咧，其實有嗰個回報嘅。

129
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:45,580
噉我我會喺下一次我補翻一份文件咧，就係我哋蒐集翻啲資料咧，就通知翻畀誒委員會知道嘅。噉我或者睇下馬成春先生會唔會有其他補充？

130
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,270
係馬承信先生。

131
00:27:48,980 --> 00:28:08,990
Thank you, Chairman. Perhaps if I could just supplement the last point about the industry directing people away from the default investment strategies. Accept Mr. Tang's point, this is a legitimate concern. We would not want to see that behaviour. These, the strategy would would need to be presented fairly to members. We will have our own publicity arrangements in relation to that, but we also expect the industry

132
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,780
to promote this fairly and not misrepresent.

133
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:29,540
We have already issued a circular letter to the industry to that effect, relying on our powers under the intermediaries part of our law, which was introduced a few years ago, reminding them that if they, their salespeople, their intermediaries.

134
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:49,870
speak to members about investing in particular funds or strategies like the default investment strategy or moving to something else. That this does kick off the suitability requirements in our law, so they would need to undertake a full needs assessment and suitability assessment of the member. So it may be appropriate for some members that they do that, and if members are

135
00:28:49,870 --> 00:29:00,580
Approach them for advice, then that's entirely appropriate. They go through that process, but they should not do it casually, and they should do it fairly. And we have already reminded them of that, and will certainly pursue that as a supervisory issue.

136
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,630
好，下一位啦，阿善總嘉議。

137
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:14,090
主席，我多謝誒，誒局方嘅介誒局方同埋咧個緊急基金管理局嘅介紹啦。誒，我都需要一係列嘅資料嘅啦，即係我睇到誒。

138
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:25,970
嗰個第十四頁嗰個slide嗰度啦，即係關於你哋嗰個即係實施嘅時間表噉樣樣。嗱，我相信咧，即係嗰個預設基金咧，我唔知道而家會唔會已經有一啲誒。

139
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:46,260
所謂誒，受受託人佢哋旗下嘅基金裏邊已經有啲符合呢一個嘅要求啦。我唔知咁誒，我我想問誒，你哋誒，即係如果有噉，你話我知有有幾多啦？已經有。如果冇咧，係咪條例過之後，佢哋陸陸續續會開設啦？咁跟住咧就誒，你哋可唔可？

140
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,840
可以誒做啲統計數字畀我哋咧，就係關於。

141
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,200
潛在啊，即係potentially，即係佢哋，即係誒，你哋覺得。

142
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:04,540
到時係符合撥入呢一個預設基金有幾多噉樣樣？即係當然，我明白到每個誒。

143
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:24,830
誒強積金嘅持有人，強積金嘅持有人佢幾任何時間佢都可以選擇，即係唔加入呢一個預置基金。但係我只係話咧，個潛在有幾多噉樣樣咁而分散喺誒。我想你做啲統計數字嚇，畀我哋睇睇，即係take一個snapshot，即係喺我哋未通過法例之前嘅情況係點樣樣。

144
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:44,840
我相信同事會有興趣，我最先我有興趣啦。咁可能到到真係通過法例之後實施咗之後，可能都有啲檢討嘅空間。咁到時都有一個即係對照啊，即係究竟未開之前係點，開咗之後即係會係點噉樣樣。同埋當然我唔係好想話誒誒逼使你哋做一樣嘅預測，但係我覺得都有一個誒。

145
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:58,740
誒educated guess啦，即係一個誒你哋一個客觀啲嘅估算，會係有啲咩嘅誒趨勢嘅，最誒誒嘅估估計有幾多會轉去呢一部分嘅投資噉樣樣嚇。

146
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:19,050
好啊！副秘書長係主席，或者我我我嘗試瞭解啊啊，善議員嘅第一個問題噉，因為而家我哋呢個法例如果通過咗之後咧，其實咧每一個受託人咧，佢都要係呈交一個誒呢一個預設投資安排佢嗰個誒建議咧，係畀強積金咧佢。

147
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:39,060
審批嘅噉，所以咧就係話佢咧呢個高度劃一咧，就係話頭先我哋講咧，佢呢一個噉嘅誒組成呢兩個基金咧，係一定要符合呢個環球誒分散風險啦，同埋隨年齡咧係降低風險。而隨年齡降低風險呢個咧，其實講講講得簡單啲咧，喺基金界咧就係我哋叫人生階段基金（lifestyle）。咁其實係現有。

148
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:59,070
好咧，係係的確係有嘅。咁誒，如果一個比較咧，或者我哋可以睇翻現有嘅預設安排。現有嘅預設安排咧，我哋有一啲咧係混合資產基金嘅。咁呢一個咧就有十二個誒計劃，就係而家係嘅。咁有十二個咧就係一啲保守基金，正如頭先我所講咧，等於擺喺銀行存款。咁呢個就佔咗大部分咧，而家預設安排。

149
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:19,080
咁其實一個比較咧，就係話比較翻我哋推出咗一個新嘅呢個核心基金之後，呢個預算安排同翻而家預算安排就住回報收費嚟嚟睇咧，係一個我哋可以做出一個誒誒一個啊啊比較嘅。又或者咧係誒單單，因為我哋而家呢一個預算投資安排其實講得簡單啲咧，亦都係一個混合。

150
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:33,980
資產基金亦都可以同一啲現有嘅混合資產基金咧，個收費同埋回報咧係作一個比較。咁但係呢個咧，相信咧就係要等呢一個預設投資安排推出咗之後咧，係起碼可能要三年之後咧，作出個比較咧，先係比較一個誒誒。

151
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:40,300
誒好啲嘅一個即係時間咧，係去做一個噉嘅誒誒比較嘅。

152
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,300
咁誒，至於第二個問題，就係。

153
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,650
誒嗯。

154
00:32:47,150 --> 00:33:07,160
係誒，關於就係話個估算有幾多誒計劃嘅成員咧，係會轉去呢個基金噉。當然係誒好難去作出個估計。咁但係咧，就正如我哋嗰個誒諮詢文件嗰個其實提到咧，係喺一兩年前誒強積金管呢個係做過一啲誒一啲意見調查嘅。咁大概咧係有百。

155
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:27,170
百分之二十四嘅計劃成員咧，佢係冇作出安排嘅，即係聲稱佢從來冇做過一個誒投資決定嘅。咁所以我哋如果從從人數去計咧，我哋預計係大概有二十四個一啲誒現行嘅計劃成員咧係冇做一個投資安排。咁但係佢哋會唔會傳播落去咧？咁呢個真係未知之數。咁正如頭先我哋所講啦，我哋一定。

156
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:47,180
會係即係就住呢個如是頭先嗰排咧，係作出一個宣傳，係畀佢哋知道咧，就係話其實講嚟講去就係話誒理不理財，財不理理。我哋每一個人咧都應該係為自己個退休咧係做出一啲誒誒管理嘅。咁如果大家係即係冇一個誒信心或者冇一個知識咧，去做出一個資產嘅一個。

157
00:33:47,180 --> 00:34:07,190
配置嘅話咧，呢一個預設安排咧就係自動幫計劃成員咧係就住一個四十年嘅投資光景咧，係自動幫佢做一個投資配置，係一個唔錯嘅選擇嚟嘅。啊，多謝主席。好，阿錢仲佳議。其實未答我問題，我其實唔係問呢呢個而家現行嘅預設安排，即係我想問而家而而家嗰啲誒基金佢嘅。

158
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:25,900
旗下會唔會已經有一啲符合咗你哋新建議嘅要求？如果冇，你哋預計咧，佢哋係係咪即係誒基金過？因為你話半年嘅時間啊嘛，過咗之後半年佢就開始做呢一個手續，然之後就半年就又嗰個基金就available係咪咁咧？嚇？

159
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:33,350
誒，副秘書長，哦，好啊，馬成信先生。Thank you, thank you, Chairman.

160
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:49,650
I can say categorically, none of the existing default funds comply with the requirements of the law. So they will need new constituent funds. It is possible that some in this area here, some of these mixed asset funds might be able to be converted into.

161
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,610
The new two CFs.

162
00:34:52,890 --> 00:35:08,260
但 in all likelihood， and what we're hearing from the trustees， they accept that they need new constituent funds for this。 even if they have constituent funds which meet meet the requirements， they do not have the de-risking strategy in place。 so everyone needs something new。 so there will be a transition required in every scheme。

163
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,230
好，再排隊。好，第二輪啦，啊，阿陳偉業議員。

164
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:27,640
冇冇，主席，我索一連串嘅問題，希望即係短問短答啦。嗯，即係加下呢個所謂呢個預設投資呢樣嘢咧，係將來每一間嘅誒公司都會有一個。

165
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:41,510
都會有一個預設呢一個噉樣嘅計劃啊？定係會統籌，會由即係啲機構係統籌得一個預設噉樣嘅計劃㗎？

166
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:52,800
誒副秘書長係誒主席係每一個計劃都有一個預設投資安排，係受多啲規管。咁即係譬如你嘅十幾間公司就有十幾個預設計劃嘅咯，佢係。

167
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:13,310
誒，其實我哋唔係以公司計嘅，因為我哋強積金管理局誒強強積金計劃咧係以每一個計劃計嘅，即係話一個誒僱主咧，佢首先要選取咗個計劃畀佢個僱員咧去揀選嗰啲基金。你呢個計劃邊一個經營咧？因為家下誒僱主同僱員係揀呢一個嘅誒公司㗎嘛，即係邊一間公司？

168
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:33,320
負責邊個財務公司負責呢一個嘅強積金㗎嘛係誒而家咧就係僱主去揀一個計劃咁一間誒銀行或者係一個保險公司咧，佢可能係提供兩至三個計劃都會有嘅。咁所以我哋而家咧就話每一個計劃咧都要有呢個二處安排。噉係咪而家我哋就有三十八個計劃？噉係咪三？

169
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:53,330
三十八個計劃就係代表有三十八個唔同嘅預設安排咧。咁唔係嘅，因為點解咧？我哋即係喺業界嗰邊瞭解咧，係有啲誒誒提供呢啲誒嘅銀行啊、或者保險公司咧，或者點解唔可以？係等我答完先，唔係即係點解唔可以呢個嘅設定一個中央？

170
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,110
呢個嘅設計中央統籌中央呢個嘅管理嘅預設計劃咧。

171
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:19,400
所謂中央統籌、中央管理嘅意思係咪頭先政府成立個法定機構係嘛？未未，因為家下啲人唔信呢啲財務公司啊嘛，唔信呢啲即係投資公司啊嘛，即係覺得佢個行政費太貴，就請啲零點七五呢個省號再傾啦。咁但係即係既然啲人供唔信呢一啲嘅機構。

172
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:39,420
咁點解唔由呢一個嘅政府成立一個法定機構，或或者金管局下面成立一個？我唔知得唔得啦。成立一個機構，既然你預設啲嘢基本上咁穩定、咁清晰嘅，噉你未由中央定咗啲人信佢嘅，就減少行政費啊嘛。譬如你成三十幾個類似預設嘅之間又出現好多問題，你？

173
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,960
你逢親越分得越細咧，個管理費就越貴㗎嘛。

174
00:37:44,930 --> 00:38:04,940
誒主席係主席啊！我諗陳議員嗰個問題咧，就係正如頭先啊，鄧議員都有提到，就係話會唔會成立一個公共受託人去做呢一個噉嘅預設安排？咁呢個其實喺諮詢嗰陣時都有個詳細嘅討論。噉我哋嗰個誒要平衡嘅就係話，如果我哋要做一個即係誒公共受託人咧，我哋一定會立法啦。嗱，成立一個即係法定嘅機構。

175
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:24,950
而根據咧，即係其實要再推出成立咗法定機構，再推出呢個預算安排咧，中間可能要講緊招標啦。因為如果講緊有十個百分之十嘅資產去咗呢個預算安排咧，都講緊係六百億嘅。咁所以主席咧，我哋要睇一睇，其實唔係咁簡單嘅。做一個中央受託人咧，佢需要個時間係非常非常。

176
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:44,960
市場，但係頭先我哋睇到咧，我哋喺二零一四年做完諮詢，今日已經可以嚟呢一度咧，係開呢一個法案委員會。我哋用一個市場嗰個誒，而家市場為本呢個安排咧，係好快好快已經可以引入呢一個收費安排。呢個係首次有一個收費安，收費安排。中央建議講咗十幾年啦，由強積金開始。

177
00:38:44,960 --> 00:39:03,160
有討論，即係已經唔少唔少人士，包括我在內，由此而中，我哋都唔信呢啲嘅，即係財務公司牽引一個中央機構去做啦，就唔係新意見嚟嘅呢個。咁但係頭先我所講嘅話，即係你每一間嘅投資公司又成立呢啲預測計劃，到時未滿覆，即係呢個五花八門。

178
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,810
即係個別呢啲噉嘅預設計劃，又另外一間公司行政嗰時，一間公司兩個預設計劃，哇！到時咪亂到七彩。

179
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:31,980
誒副秘書長誒主席，頭先我哋解釋過啦。正如我哋呢一個投影片睇到咧，我哋係一個高度咧係即係受規管嘅一個預設計劃，就係有兩個咧係投資基金嘅，所以就唔係沒沒五誒誒五花八門嘅。我哋就係話佢一定咧係有一個誒係誒百分之四十係投資喺一個。

180
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:51,990
誒誒低風險嘅資產啦，百分之六十係高風險資產。咁呢個咧就係十八至五十歲將會投資喺度，而五十歲之後咧就係會投資係一個咧就係話喺誒百分之八十咧係低風險，百分之二十咧係高風險嘅基金嚟嘅。嗱，呢你講咗啦，唔好唔好再咁復啦呢呢個。但係個問題就係，即係你既然咁高規管。

181
00:39:51,990 --> 00:40:12,000
你咪叫啲十幾廿間公司係嘛聯合成立一個或者兩個嘅預設計劃，咁啲人買就啲人咧就淨係集中，淨係要呢個計劃。因為家下個問題就係你越多細節，越多呢個嘅即係誒，即係分開個別做嘅話咧，就越多誹惑出，同埋越多越高行政費啊！

182
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:32,010
嘛噉，如果既然咁高格規管嘅，噉你咪定咗一個嘅模式，要令呢十幾間公司咧聯合一齊，即係一個嘅項目。咁啲人買咧係買呢個項目，咁要確保嗰個嘅管理上，第一唔會嗰個行政費即係可能大幅低過零點七五添啦。如果咁做。

183
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,000
好係嘛？有冇考慮過呢個建議咧？

184
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:55,740
副秘書長，誒主席，我我相信我明白啊啊陳議員嗰個建議，即係話點樣可以喺推出呢個預測安排咧，有一啲集中嘅一啲方法去做，而減低個成本。咁誒，正如我頭先所講啦，即係你任何一啲集中去做，無論係點樣去。

185
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:15,750
集中去做咧，都係牽涉好多一啲即係商討啊，同埋亦都可能係有個招標嘅程序。我哋而家一個事實就係話，我哋喺二零一四年九月做完嗰個諮詢咧，今日已經可以將個法例喺度提出嚟，可以好快係引入呢一個收費安排。頭先我哋講咗咧，就係話呢一個零點七五嗰個收費嗰個上限咧，係所

186
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:35,760
所有呢啲計劃咧都係要遵守嘅，而我哋咧係一個高度劃一嘅一個誒規管啦，就係佢哋係要有呢兩個基金。但係你覺得好荒謬咩？高度劃一得嚟，到時即係十幾間公司個別有自己一兩個計劃，係嘛？即係即即你你你既然高度劃一，就無需要咁多間公司。

187
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,500
提供服務啦，真係。

188
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:56,650
咁嗱，你不如噉，你另一個另一個變相做法咧，你啲十幾間公司畀個proposal政府或者畀畀個某機構啦，跟住你哋就甄選，咦？呢個機構所提供呢一個咧收費最低，係嘛？同埋你哋最信任嘅，咁咪畀呢個嘅呢個嘅僱主自己揀咯。

189
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:17,210
咁可能仲好喎，集中係嘛？同埋你計一計就話，咦？即係譬如成個嘅強積金，譬如有百分之十或者百分之二十或者三十，即係你做嘅scenario嘅推算，百分之幾多咧？呢一個噉樣嘅即係預即係預設嘅咧，嗰個嘅管理情況係會點？噉你有啲假設嘅時候咧，佢咪畀啲公

190
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:37,220
司自己建議出嚟，咁可能百分之五十嘅強積金啲人就會買呢一個嘅服務㗎咯。咁可能嗰個嘅穩定性同埋個可可信性係嘛？同埋嗰個嘅成本效益係更高更高喎。你而家係畀好多空間呢啲財務公司玩嘢，同埋呢一個嘅將將呢個。

191
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:57,230
個強積金啲人啲錢嚟，即係亂個舞啊嘛，又係嘛，即係我覺得你考慮下頭先我嘅建議，即係我覺得你而家現時嘅做法係達未必達到到你原本嗰個嘅目呢個目的嘅呢個好啊，副秘書長，我畀你答埋之後，就下一位㗎啦，係或者如果我誤解咗陳宇然嘅誒？

192
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:17,240
誒問題就先抱歉，但係我諗誒，即係我哋喺呢一個條例之下咧，我哋規管嘅咧就係受託人，而我哋強積金計劃咧係以一個計劃為一個單位，所以咧就唔係話一間公司咧係即係推出幾多個誒預設安排，唔係係每一個計劃咧，我哋都希望咧。

193
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:35,770
係有一個誒預設安排，係符合我哋法例個要求，亦都咧係有一個收費嘅管制，就係改善而家咧呢個亂七八糟，即係正如頭先阿陳議員講，可能而家咧即係五花八門嘅一個安排，而令到有啲受託誒誒有啲計劃成員咧，佢係唔識揀唔想揀咧。

194
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:56,060
佢揀個計劃咧，因為僱主揀嘅，噉啊跌咗落去一個叫做強積金保守基金嗰度咧，就只係得零點八個percent嘅回報，係非常之唔理想嘅。因為呢個等於就係擺喺銀行嘅存款啊嘛。我覺得而家就係話將佢咧變成係一個人生階段基金，而外國亦都有經驗咧，預設安排咧，通常都係用一啲噉嘅人生階段嘅一個隨年。

195
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:16,070
咧係降低風險誒嘅投資策略嘅，咁得出嚟嘅一個效果咧係對個計劃成員係好嘅。噉我當然明白，其實啊，陳議員講咧係一個好好嘅提議，就係話我哋點樣可以做到一個規模效益啊嘛。其實你講咁耐就係要規模效益。咁呢一個咧，我哋係做咗一啲即係平衡嘅。誒，要有規模效益。

196
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:36,080
嘅咧，亦都有一個我哋所講叫做高度集中風險（concentration risk）。我哋點樣去平衡各樣嘅考慮咧？就係話喺我哋點解今次要做一個公眾諮詢啊嘛？有業界同埋即係社會人士去睇。噉我哋睇翻翻嚟咧，就係話平衡咗各樣嘅考慮咧，我哋覺得咧係用而家一個噉嘅誒以市場為本嘅一個安排去。

197
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:42,310
做咧可以最快引入呢一個收費管制零點七五嚇。

198
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,220
我哋睇到頭先，我哋第一個誒嗰個橫盾片咧。

199
00:44:48,380 --> 00:45:00,700
唔好意思，即係我哋係好快係二零一四年做完諮詢，今日已經有個條例，就係因為用呢個方法，我哋就係考慮到我哋要盡快做一個收費管制。多謝主席。好，下位葉國軒議員。

200
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:21,620
誒多謝主席。我要申報利益。我本身係積金呢個積金局嘅非洲人董事啊。咁咧就有關誒呢方面，頭先陳美宇員講一個問題，即係話點。其實佢關鍵點咧在於點解你唔可以由政即係一個位得一個嘅。

201
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:41,630
嘅嘅誒，依一個噉樣嘅預預設基金去做，而係再畀翻現有現有則計劃緊嘅依啲噉樣個個咁多嘅基金，佢佢進行又整誒下邊有一個噉樣嘅誒誒預設嘅投資基金，即係噉樣嘅係。

202
00:45:41,630 --> 00:46:01,640
主要係從依個方案，噉我覺得嚟講咧，即係即係係咪可我可正翻咪可以清楚嚟解釋翻？即係頭先都提及到啊，以市以市場為本啦，即係作依個去考慮，因為已經基金嚟講咧係作咗係一個好長時間，依十幾年嚇，而嚇嘅喺依方面嘅運作，而家佢本身嘅市場上邊。

203
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:21,650
已經係運作之中。如果啲係係咪可行？而家將突然間要整一個嘅中央唯一一個嘅，又可能係政府本身控制住嘅，就可以解決嗰個問題咧。咁呢點可唔可以啊？誒，即係誒誒，或或者馬生，你可唔可以幫手喺呢方面，佢能夠解解個問題，即係。

204
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,610
呢個角度係點睇法咧？嚇，多謝主席。好，誒，馬成信先生。

205
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:47,390
Thank you, Chairman. Let me try to address the question this way. To look at this a different way, what we're doing is this is a privately managed second pillar system. The pre-existing fact is we have thirty-eight schemes alive and operating now. At its heart, what this proposal is about is well, what is the rule in each of those thirty-eight

206
00:46:47,390 --> 00:47:07,400
Scheme's about members who do not make a choice. Every scheme has to have a rule about what happens if they don't get instructions. So at the administrative end, this is just about that rule set. Now we've taken the opportunity to do other things like fee cap and the controls and standardisation, but this has to be based on what is the

207
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:27,410
Rule in every single scheme, so each scheme has to have an arrangement. That is the starting point. And this also has to respect the reality that the administrative arrangements our employers give monies to a particular trustee, so they put money in a particular scheme. That is the infrastructure we have. So our rule set is about well, what happens to that money if we've got no instruction?

208
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:47,420
Now I accept the ambition. Some of the questions relate to about can we do this more efficiently, and I agree that we should try to do this more efficiently. But that very much goes to the investment end. Can this be invested in a way that uses bigger pools of money to achieve investment efficiencies? And I think it can. And indeed, I think that's likely the.

209
00:47:47,420 --> 00:48:07,430
outcome for a number of providers that they won't try to do the investment work underneath themselves. That they, because of the fee cap, they have to find efficient structures to deliver this. So some of them will inevitably use common underlying investment pools to deliver this, and so they will get that centralisation that way. It won't.

210
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:13,160
with a single one, but it won't mean that every single strategy and every single

211
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:30,550
Scheme ends up having its own underlying investment product, so there will be some common pooling arising out of that, and so there is some efficiency delivered that way. But this does need to start from the premise that this is about a rule for each and every one of the 38 schemes. What happens to money for which they got no instructions?

212
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:52,180
好，姚光謙員，你有冇想再追問？誒，其實即係頭先馬生都都講咗啦，即係你你即係喺個起步點啊。咁如果走喺個起步點咧，咁誒會唔會亦唔排除將來可能會有一個真係誒，可能係政府誒嘅。

213
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:59,920
嘅嘅一個角色，或者唔係係一個都係私人嘅嘢，真真係統一一個噉樣嘅投資策略基金咧，會有噉樣可能性？

214
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:20,340
係誒副秘書長未來誒主席或者噉樣講啦，即係每一個制度咧都會即係隨住時間咧去演進嘅。噉我即係喺即係學誒誒將來會點樣去演進咧？噉我哋即係現今好難去講。咁但係喺就住誒今日嚟講咧，我哋如果要誒處理嘅問題就係話。

215
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:33,130
話而家個預設安排係令到計劃成員咧嗰個誒利益咧係未受到保障嘅話咧，我哋係要解決呢個問題咧。我哋而家呢個方案咧，我哋覺得係最有效同埋最快捷嘅。啊，多謝主席。

216
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:39,030
好，有冇啲第一輪嘅要問嘅？如果冇咧，哦，好，嗯。

217
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:59,950
陳建波員係多謝主席。誒，我想問一問咧，就而家你嗰啲主要安排都係喺環球股票嗰度啦，即係都即係當佢年青啊多啲，後來少啲啦。咁但係大家知咧，如果你話而家全世界咧，歐洲唔係一個好環境啦，美國股票都冇乜點大跌啦，但係香港同國內咧就比較。

218
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:11,180
係一個即係可能會跌完，都係比較增長好嘅地方。點解會做一個噉嘅決定咧？即係你邊你其實成個目的都係希望佢哋一個好啲嘅回報啦。但係如果你又將佢擺翻落去咧？

219
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:25,970
即係你可以話係一個穩陣啲啊，將個全曬股票攞埋，但係亦都會有個後果，就係你知風險同嗰個回報係成正比㗎嘛。如果你個風險減低咗，你個回報一定係減低咗。可唔可以解下點解會噉啊？決定咧係一定要擺呢個環球股票。

220
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,710
誒邊位答？

221
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:49,880
Thank you. This question very much goes to the design aspects of the asset allocation approach, and where we've looked at to that is global learnings, what happens elsewhere, how others are approaching this globally, and also we've asked the OECD to do some modelling for us about various scenarios, how how to make this work, and.

222
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,440
As I understand Mr Chan's question, it very much goes to this.

223
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:13,730
for the risky assets, why globally and why not some particular focus more locally? He rightly makes the point that it could be the case that local markets might have higher returns over time, and that might be so. But we have to look at this probabilistically. On all the analysis we have, that is just a straight risk-return trade.

224
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:25,580
It's possible. It may even be probable that you get higher returns, but that necessarily comes with higher risk and higher volatility. And the whole focus of this, looking at this glide chart here, is

225
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:45,910
完全關於管理一些那些結果風險。整個目標在這裡，在去風險化的方法是試圖最小化真正壞結果對人們的影響。在最後一天，所以並不是關於達到最高的可能回報。我們知道在理論上。

226
00:51:45,910 --> 00:52:05,920
That to get the highest probability of average highest returns over a long period of time, you put more in equities and more in risky equities like Hong Kong. But that also increases the prospect that people will get very bad outcomes at bad points in times. And that's the peculiarity about retirement savings. We have to focus on delivery at a point in time when people take the benefits out.

227
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:26,020
what happens in the forty years after that isn't so important. It's what happens immediately before that. And so this whole de-risking approach is based on a strategy which takes a medium approach to risk and tries to get the efficiencies we can. We know one of the only free lunches in the market is diversification, and the greater the diversification, the greater that benefit. And so

228
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:46,030
它留喺那層。Having said that， we've not regulated how the providers have to invest that sixty percent equity， and we're leaving that the investment professionals， the local investment professionals， to work on。 They may well come up with a view that takes a particular approach to some overexposure to local equities。 They might not。 We haven't。

229
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:53,520
有他們最終結論 on that， but that's not it's not proposed that that be controlled by the law. that that's a matter of industry speciality.

230
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:12,940
係啊，主席即係係啦。我如果咁即係一個好處，就話能夠可以畀佢哋多啲彈性。譬如佢話，就算環球可能誒香港或者國內都係佔誒六成噉樣，噉我相信嗰個結果又會好過一啲咩咁呢個彈性，你會畀翻佢㗎嘛？係嘛？你會畀翻嗰個基金公司自己決定。

231
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,730
啊，馬成信先啦。

232
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:35,670
Yes, chairman. We've left the issue. As I said, we're not so ambitious to want to regulate down to security selection level, nor individual country allocation. We believe that's a matter for the investment experts. So we've asked the industry bodies to work together to come up with a reference portfolio for each other as to how this should be looked at on a normalised basis. So.

233
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:55,680
係，係，係。好，我想我想另外一個問題咧，就因為時間有限啦，我想講翻咧，就希望你都留意業界嗰個誒，即係佢哋要配合㗎嘛，即係佢哋都要可以真係噉，所以呢個主要都係業界做唔做到咧。希望你誒能夠注重嗰啲技術性嘅要求，因為我知道有啲有幾個項目都仲係傾緊嘅，咁希望你能夠即係。

234
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:08,450
係要體諒到業界，因為牽涉咁多户口咧，同埋亦都係希望諗到一個最有效嘅方法，令到咧係對嗰啲無論係消費者啊，對業界都係能夠最有效做到呢樣嘢。咁希望你能夠細心即係聽佢哋個諗法咯。

235
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,310
好。

236
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,690
誒第一輪嘅就冇邊位？

237
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:22,530
如果冇咧，我都想誒，我自己都想問，其實誒呢個強制性公積金咧，自從二千年開始到而家咧。

238
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:30,650
誒比較多嘅意見咧，就認為係嗰個管理費收費過高，所以咧就希望政府要去管啦。

239
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:48,810
噉啊，另外一個咧就係嗰個回報率咧，種種原因咧都係即係好多情況都唔理想。雖然咧，誒誒，強積金管理局咧就話個平均回報率有好似係咪五個percent？

240
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,340
啊！定係三個定五個，我唔～

241
00:54:52,750 --> 00:55:03,250
三點六咁誒，咁喺噉嘅情況底下咧，即係大家都覺得誒，即係可能有通脹嗰度都冚唔翻條數。

242
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:13,900
噉啊，咁所以都係有誒，有好多就誒覺得係失望嘅，或者係有啲咧，甚至有啲比較誒。

243
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:34,350
嘅誒嘅計劃咧，甚至係誒入獄嘅，食到入獄嘅嚇。咁咁呢次咧，而家呢個做法咧就誒希望有一個比較誒穩陣少少啊嘅嘅投資，噉啊，然後希望嗰個。

244
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:54,360
誒回報率當然我諗就一定會低㗎啦，噉啊管理費用又低，噉啊誒希望即係穩穩陣陣噉，咁但係嚟講咧就誒，所以大家其實誒剛才一啲議員嘅發言裏邊咧都希望有冇啲其他嘅方式啊，譬如。

245
00:55:54,360 --> 00:56:14,370
有啲提到係政府去做啦，或者交畀金融管理局去做啦。誒一啲嘅基金啊出嚟，噉啊希望可以誒管理費可以再低，或者甚至唔使收，或者係誒嗰個有有有冇啲可以誒保證得到？

246
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:32,880
嘅一啲回報，噉啊希望可以保障到啲打工仔嘅權益。噉啊呢個方面，誒我知道政府就現階段就唔唔作呢個考慮㗎啦。而家都係行緊呢一步，即係覺得誒行咗呢步先啦，以後再講啦。咁雖然正話。

247
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:53,170
誒副秘書長都講話，而家呢個咧係最快嘅，可以做得成啊。如果講其他嘢咧，都唔知搞到幾時啊，就就覺得呢個係而家呢個誒計劃嗰個嘅優點啊。咁但係誒，我相信喺議員嘅發言裏邊咧，你都聽得到咧就。

248
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:13,530
就有啲認為誒喺呢方面咧，特別對嗰啲誒供款人啊，對打工仔咧，各方面即係嗰個得益咧，都係誒有限啊。咁誒不過我相信，因為呢個政府而家定咗呢個方向嚟講咧，噉我哋唯有就係。

249
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:24,590
係可以繼續畀意見嚇，咁又希望啊政府不斷去去檢討，而係點樣去去改善誒而家呢個噉嘅情況嘅出現咧。

250
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:44,880
就誒有副秘書長有冇嘢想誒回應？如果冇，可以就啊作一個意見。係誒，多謝主席，好快一個回應啦。噉我當然明白啦，即係作為打工仔，佢希望緊係回報越高越好，收費越低越好。咁但係我哋都要理解，就係話頭先我哋提到咧，如果

251
00:57:44,880 --> 00:58:04,890
都用政府包底呢個咧，其實我想提一提就係世界個主流咧，都係由一啲誒政府包底嘅計劃咧，係轉向咧係一啲即係唔包底嘅計劃。咁其實誒，我哋時不時都睇到歐美嘅國家咧，都係做緊呢一個噉嘅方向。點解咧？就係話大家真係好難咧睇到嗰個市場。

252
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:24,900
咧嗰個投資回報係點？如果政府再出一個包底咧，係一個非常之沉重嘅一個即係財務承擔嚟嘅。咁所以就係我哋見到有好多政府咧，其實咧就係唔會做即係政府包底呢樣嘢，即係負擔唔起。咁呢個係一個好即係誒實在嘅問題。而所謂政府包底，錢從

253
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:44,910
何來咧？都係要從納税人嗰個袋嚟嘅。咁所以其實就誒，我哋覺得用一個即係市場嘅方式係會比較好一啲。而我哋其實呢一個優點咧，就誒亦都係誒誒有喺度嘅。誒睇到就係話嗰個回報係咪真係咁差咧？咁如果我哋睇翻即係誒。

254
00:58:44,910 --> 00:59:04,920
強積金呢個計劃行咗十五年，一啲混合資產嗰個誒十五年個回報咧，其實平均係三點六個percent嘅。我哋而家講緊呢個預設安排都係其實係啲混混合資產嘅基金噉，而同期嗰個即係通脹率咧就係一點七個percent。咁頭先我講嗰三點六個percent已經係減曬所有嘅費用，一個正回報嚟嘅。

255
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:24,930
咁所以，如果我哋用一個複息計算咧，每年有三點六個percent嘅回報咧，係誒喺投資上嚟講咧，真係唔係話太差嘅。咁只不過就係話，正如頭先啊主席講，有一啲誒計劃成員咧，佢係揀咗一啲誒基金咧，可能就揀得唔好，噉就變咗有一個即係負回報添。咁呢個正正。

256
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:44,940
咧就其實我哋諮詢文件有提到喺外國亦都做咗一啲調查咧，誒投資者通常咧係會即係太過咧係自信嘅，就作出一啲咧係即係非最佳嘅一啲選擇，而令到佢個投資咧係誒唔理想。噉我哋覺得呢一個咧係誒預設投資安排咧，就係話希望咧啲。

257
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:56,260
計劃成員咧，如果佢真係唔識或者唔想去揀嘅話咧，呢一個就係最容易誒幫佢去平衡風險同埋回報嘅一個選擇嚟嘅。多謝主席。

258
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:08,130
誒副秘書長，我都想誒補充問下咧，就你就話政府包底好睏難啦。咁有時政府發行啲I bond啊，噉你都有保證嗰個回報，咁嗰度誒。

259
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:28,420
都做得到，點解啊？即係強強積金計劃呢方面唔可以用同樣嘅辦法？呢呢個誒，多謝主席。咁首先，I bond嗰個咧，佢有另外一個即係誒目的啦。咁同埋嗰個法案同我哋而家呢一個講緊強積金呢一個資產個值咧，即係亦都係有一個相對。

260
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:48,430
咁遠，而家我哋差唔多有六千億誒嘅資產喺度，亦都係不斷滾存誒，咁所以嗰個承擔咧係會不斷咁去大化誒，而你一喺有一個誒即係包底嘅話咧，就好難撤回。而我哋I bond咧，政府一直都冇講咧，係話一個長期性嘅一個措施嚟嘅。咁所以我諗呢兩兩。

261
01:00:48,430 --> 01:01:08,440
者咧係有個好大嘅分別嚇。多謝主席。好啦，噉就誒第一輪，如果冇人問咧，就進入第二輪。第二輪因為兩位啊排緊隊嘅一位就鄧家彪，一位就係善仲佳。噉啊，阿鄧家彪，完誒，我哋繼續誒用翻係五誒四誒五分鐘嚇。啊，多謝主席。即係當頭先討論規模下。

262
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:18,770
效應又好，或者係即係集中一間或者兩間嘅受託人去做投資管理都好咧。其實呢啲方案咧，一早已經講咗。

263
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:39,060
其實亦都唔係唔可行嘅，即係問題，你哋有冇決心？因為咧就你多次嘅關於收費嘅報告都講咧，啊，強積金未夠大，資產咧未夠多，所以咧計內平均嗰個收費咧高咯。咁呢個邏輯應該都擺落去呢一個嘅核心基金嘅問題。

264
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:59,070
上面如果你核心基金，我假設而家七百幾億噉，你除三十八個計劃，當然有啲大，有啲細啦。其實每個計劃唔係好多錢嘅啫，廿零三廿億噉。當然呢個係平均亂噏啦，有啲我知係龍頭，可能已經揸住百幾億噉，但係個規模效應根本係發揮唔到㗎嘛。咁所以所以誒。

265
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:11,130
嗯，我真係有時唔理解。當然我明啊，你哋平衡嘅就係平衡受託人手頭上面揸住啲資產，唔會轉畀另一個競爭對手呢一個平衡佢哋嘅利益嘅做法，多過係乜嘢？

266
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:31,420
咁所以即係希望你哋咧，誒第一就係可以有個誒，即係誒檢討嘅平台。第二都希望有個展望，話都畀我聽，究竟你哋長遠係點睇？如果都係成效不彰，零點七五就變成最高收費，即係最低收費，永遠就係零點七五。

267
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:49,160
即係根本跌唔到落去，咁又點樣咧？第二就係，誒對於整體可能佢哋即係都係，即係冇一個突破。你話標竿啊嘛，啊希望即係慢慢大家對強積金有信心，但係都搞唔掂嘅話，咁點咧？都希望你哋即係啲展望咧。第一。

268
01:02:49,660 --> 01:03:09,670
第二咧，誒嗰個嘅誒核心基金嗰個處理咧，嗰七百幾億嗰個問題咧，即係我我估係七百幾億啊。咁究竟你哋有冇啲數字同埋人數話畀我聽咧？多次你哋都係講啊，靠一個即係市民調查，就唔係靠咧受託人話。

269
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:29,680
話畀你哋聽，究竟有幾多人係不作投資選擇？噉你哋係咪都唔會花呢個心思去做？總之我個法例一個咧，總之擺咗去呢啲基金度嘅，我就自動轉移㗎啦。因為我所知有啲受託人咧嘅做法咧，佢直頭係將譬如話你唔做投資選擇，佢個計劃有十。

270
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:37,110
個計劃，如果計劃有十隻基金，佢就將你嗰筆錢打散，隨意十個基金擺落去嘅，咁呢啲係點搞咧？

271
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,320
誒呢個第一啦，第二就係誒。

272
01:03:41,600 --> 01:04:01,610
嗰個嘅誒保證基金，你話係豁免，我想知係完全嘅豁免咧，定係即係我我睇唔清你嗰個power嗰個第二點啊？誒誒豁免嗰度究竟係佢到咗六十歲而佢揀咗保證基金先豁免，定係唔係㗎？總之佢廿幾歲嗰個預設基金擺咗落去一個保。

273
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:21,620
保證基金啊，都係豁免，因為我所知保證基金嘅錢咧，七百幾億嘅核心基金咧就有，即係七百幾億嘅預設基金有百幾億咧，係擺咗喺保證基金度。噉我唔喐呢筆錢，咁但係呢筆錢為咗保證基金錶現就係最救命㗎啦嘛，收費超高，回報都係零點。

274
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:26,360
五幾至二，噉係咪真係唔喐嗰個保證基金？我想搞清楚唔該。

275
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:46,650
邊位上答？係誒主席或者好好快誒打一答頭先幾個問題噉。關於誒受託人而家會有有冇一個數，實際上有幾多計劃成員係冇作出投資決定呢一個問題，我可以一陣間請下馬誠信先生答一答。咁首先講話嗰個展望嗰度咧，就其實諮詢。

276
01:04:46,650 --> 01:05:06,660
文件都有提到嘅，噉我哋睇翻我國嘅經驗咧，推出咗一個預設投資安排，係受到一個即係某個程度上嘅規管。喺我國嘅經驗咧，係受一啲計劃成員嘅歡迎嘅。咁喺即係英國啊，同埋呢一個誒澳洲咧，我哋都見到咧係有好多計劃成員咧係會揀咗呢一個噉嘅投資誒。

277
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:26,670
預設投資安排咁點解咧？咁誒亦都一半一半，有一半咧就係佢真係咧，佢都冇時間去理，佢唔識去揀，噉就自動跌咗落去。另外有一半加入呢一個預設投資安排喺外國嘅原因咧，就係話佢覺得嗰個投資策略咧係適合佢自己嗰個誒投資目標同埋。

278
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:46,680
嘅需要噉，所以咧，我哋嘅展望咧，我哋樂觀嘅。咁誒，我希望啊，鄧家彪議員咧，即係畀少少時間我哋推出呢個新基金，就唔好我哋未推出咧，就先做一個判斷先。因為我哋即係都真係做咗好多功課，誒睇咗好多外國嘅經驗，覺得呢一個咧係適合香港個情況咁咧。

279
01:05:46,680 --> 01:06:06,690
誒，至於關於話保證基金嗰個豁免嘅意思咧，就係話頭先睇到嗱，呢呢呢個投影片睇到喺而家三十八個計劃入邊咧，就有六個咧就係擺喺一個保證基金作為嗰個預設安排。咁呢啲所謂保證基金咧係有啲條款，就係話你咧擺咗啲錢喺度咧，就唔可以轉。

280
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:11,470
唔可以喐，誒有啲係十年，有啲係誒幾多年咁先都好。

281
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:31,860
噉我哋嗰闊免嘅意思咧，就係話當我哋實行呢個條例咧，就係話如果嗰個計劃成員可以冇揀到而被安排入咗呢個保證基金咧，佢都要轉嘅。咁但係轉嗰陣時咧，佢我哋就要計一計數。如果一轉咗咧，因為佢未達到嗰個誒要求嘅誒投資年期，就

282
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:51,870
冇咗嗰個保證回報嘅咁喺呢度咧，即係話個計劃成員係會蝕嘅。噉啊，計劃成員會蝕嗰陣時咧，就不如誒一靜，不如一動就豁免，就唔需要喐咁解。所以呢一個豁免咧，係保障計劃成員啊，就係話如果一轉咧，佢冇咗嗰個誒保證回報嘅話咧，噉就不如冇轉啦嘅意思。

283
01:06:51,870 --> 01:07:08,980
啲就係噉樣，咁呢個即係好快。呢呢個漏洞咯，因為我知保證基金嗰啲回報率係可以好誇張，係講緊係零點幾至二，但係收費超高喎。噉你唔喐嗰筆錢，咁永遠保唔喐。佢話我終身保證定係點樣嘅咧？

284
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:29,350
誒主席係主席個意思就係要睇翻每一個嗰個保證基金嘅條款啦。即係如果一喐嗰陣時咧，佢一喐就係冇咗嗰啲誒，即係總之計個數咧，佢蝕嘅話咧，我哋就不如冇喐。簡單啲嚟講就係咁嚇。噉就住嗰個而家嗰個計劃成員有幾多誒人數嗰度，或者我我請。

285
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,820
馬成信先生，可唔可以作一個解答？好，馬成信先生。

286
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,450
嗯。

287
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:47,210
on the guarantee fund point, there's very few which use a guarantee fund of these six. Some of those are hard guarantees, so this exemption doesn't apply. But the concern we have is that.

288
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:57,880
this transition automatically moves some people. We don't want to automatically move people if it will cause them to lose the benefit of a guarantee that they've earned, because

289
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:18,180
The problem is they will break their time in the scheme and that cancels the guarantee. So we don't want to let the providers off the hook on the guarantee is the problem. And in many cases, well this is the test. What we're concerned about is we don't want a situation where, if they break the guarantee, what the member gets might be something dramatically less. So we don't want to force move those people.

290
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:38,190
Because that will be letting the guarantor off the hook. We want to make sure the guarantor stays on the hook for those particular schemes. I should say there are only I think two that that it actually applies to though. So it's very and they're both very small. So this isn't the big issue. This exemption doesn't apply to many. To Mr Tang's other questions on the number of members affected.

291
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:41,530
I think we've given you some data before. I should say.

292
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:57,790
How many members affected is very much dependent on what the test is, and we've gone through various versions of this test, and the industry has responded with figures on the different versions. But we started off with this principle that applies to everyone who hasn't made a choice. Well, actually, it's not quite that simple because some people made.

293
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:18,260
A choice for some of their money and not others, and some of it came in in multiple accounts, and some some in some of the accounts, some of it's got a choice and some hasn't, and some's been moved. So we've had to negotiate what's the right test, and the test that's proposed in the bill, and this has only come up fairly late in the consultation and discussion process, is that that transition.

294
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,730
requirement will apply to those accounts.

295
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:41,020
where all of the benefit in the account, so it's account level, is invested in the current default arrangement, and the trustees got no reason to believe that the members made a choice in relation to that. So that test is quite late. The trustees of course have to do some work to find out exactly who's on that list, and we've asked them to provide us with that list early or some.

296
01:09:41,020 --> 01:10:01,030
Time in 2016, well before implementation. So they'll have to give us a list. They'll have to work through that and have that prepared well in advance of implementation. Of course, that list will be dynamic though, because some people will make choices right through until the start date of the law. There'll be new members coming in and out, so that list will be dynamic. It's not going to be static, but we

297
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:11,690
我要求受託人去開始做那項工作，現在，基於我們在法案中得到的測試，假設那項測試不會在起草過程中改變。在數字方面，則是。

298
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,260
And I think I've given you these figures before.

299
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,990
Mr. Chong's already referred to the survey work. Suggested both ours and an external survey suggested about 20% of people.

300
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:34,460
don't think they've made choices. That probably overstates the actual numbers. They just forgotten. And the E and Y survey suggested about ten percent of assets. When we look at it, we think it's probably a little bit less than that because

301
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:40,340
The amount of money in current default constituent funds is about fourteen percent.

302
01:10:40,620 --> 01:11:00,630
But that includes people who've made choices as well as people who haven't. So when we make some comparison, we think that figures down probably about eight percent or nine percent, somewhere in that range of ten. But broadly it's the same. It could vary quite a bit, scheme to scheme, of course, because different people had different distribution arrangements. So it might be quite there might be variety between schemes. But we'll carefully monitor

303
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:08,690
That and make sure that the trustees do the work to identify that group early, even though it will change right up to commencement date.

304
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:15,970
好，而家第一輪嘅有啊梁國雄議員五分鐘。誒，主席，我覺得誒。

305
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:22,360
即係呢個而家呢個計劃咧，根本就係多餘嘅，即係係一個。

306
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,480
即係正式，即係官樣文章。

307
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:45,770
嗱，我哋而家喺香港咧有兩種嘅投資方法啦，即係如果用政府去投資嘅，第一個就係由金管局去管理嘅資產嗰度，噉佢每一每一每一年都會話畀我哋聽佢嘅收益係幾多噉樣樣。另一個咧就係阿曾俊華嗰個叫未來基金啦。

308
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,900
啊！佢係無啦，山達拉。

309
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:58,960
就攞咗兩千幾出嚟，然後咧就每年我哋盈餘三百分之三十到五十咧，都幫攞基金度。根據佢嘅講法，喺財經事務委員會嘅講法就係話咧。

310
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,300
因為。

311
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:09,580
做從事一個長遠性嘅投資咧，嗰個回報係多啲嘅，即係佢嘅意思暗指金管局嗰個回報不理想。咁又兩個人。

312
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:18,680
一個就叫做陳德林，一個叫曾俊華，兩兄弟嚟嘅，都係揸住香港人嘅錢啦，就去投資嘅。

313
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:24,850
咁好簡單啫嘛！你強積金係為咗保障僱員。

314
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:45,460
誒退休之後嘅一根重要嘅支柱嚟㗎嘛，所以順理成章，政府應該有個責任作為一個法人咧，去包底管理。咁老實講，你而家講嚟講喺度又話咩咩乜嘢誒誒兩種組合啊？好簡單啫嘛，政府都不可投資，噉你揀擺埋啲錢落去投投資咪？

315
01:12:45,460 --> 01:13:00,670
得咯，噉你會話喂，如果輸咗點啊？咪公帑補貼，因為你有個政策目標就係話喺香港做嘢嘅人，只要佢肯供強誒強積金，佢就會依賴呢一根支柱咧。喺佢退休嘅時候，六十五歲嗰陣時咧，有一筆錢。

316
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,310
噉就唔使即刻跌落去縱緩嗰度啊嘛！

317
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,990
呢個應該你嘅責任嚟㗎嘛？你仲講咩啫喺度？

318
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,310
當日。

319
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,650
港英政府為咗要滿足。

320
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:17,500
嗰啲基基金佬，仲有有因咁咪即係出發行咗個咁荒謬嘅制度咯？

321
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,200
因為改啊嘛。

322
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,340
仲有一個最荒謬就咩咧？

323
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:29,060
就係你資方對沖嗰度，沖下沖下，仲慘過你而家投資個低迴報啦，哥。

324
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,290
係咪啊？

325
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:38,670
你政府出呢個admin嘅嘅費用，即係話咧管理資產嘅費用，你要包啦。

326
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:44,390
係咪咁跟住用兩位嘅投資策略都唔會衰得過而家你嗰啲方案？

327
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:50,910
咁仲講咩咧？我唔知係講乜嘢喺度。而家問題就係對沖嗰度出咗問題啊嘛！你都唔講嗰個問題。

328
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,150
係咪？

329
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,590
噉你咪係咪官養民商啊？

330
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,230
係咪即係？

331
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,880
根本老實講。

332
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:07,360
真係，我哋個我哋嗰個有位議員叫梁繼昌啊，梁繼昌啊，發現啲屎啊喺個位嗰度。

333
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:10,430
我望佢哋嗰邊真係shit嘅，真係好shit。

334
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,520
所以冇嘢，你覺根本係。

335
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:15,390
政府嘅責任喺邊度啊？

336
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,660
你哋同我呢度傾就係話，要傾香港人嘅退休保障。

337
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:28,600
而家有一根支柱出現咗問題，你嗰個解決嘅方法係買鹽又唔夠鹹，買醋又唔夠酸。

338
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:34,040
你有冇聽過羅芳講嘢啊？雖雖然而家後面阿阿阿朱國斌反對。

339
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,500
你個對沖，我哋要搞掂佢啊嘛！

340
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:44,930
係嘛？你將勞方嘅應該得到資方嘅公款嗰度搞亂咗去先啦。第二，你而家發明咁多去做咩啫？

341
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,050
曾俊華同埋阿阿陳德霖都搞掂。

342
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:56,080
就算你而家攞畀攞筆錢嚟做間大馬石都掂，而家梁生發夢都想有間大馬石。

343
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,740
我唔知你搞乜，老實講。

344
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:03,550
即係，所以梁繼昌發現嗰啲嘢咧，其實就隨隨處都係嘅。

345
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,370
我覺得即係好唔好意思，我唔係冇位坐喺度。

346
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:15,110
根本就攞嚟搞，根本就係政府冇能力、冇政治嘅勇氣、冇呢個道德。

347
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:29,370
好似呢個阿阿阿梁生話：，哎呀，我啲樓啊，而我而家供應啲多啲地，有多啲私樓啊，嗰啲樓價每個單位誒平一百萬，需要好大嘅勇氣啊，用佢個頭咩？

348
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,490
佢上咗台之後啊，嗰啲樓升咗一百五十萬啊，哥！

349
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,630
呢個咩？呢個咩政府嚟㗎？我應該問你啊！你而家搞咁多嘢，正話我講嘅嘢。

350
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,330
一字咁錢。

351
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,160
我問你啊，點解？

352
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,460
陳德林同埋阿曾俊華可以攞嚿錢出嚟。

353
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,580
去投資，話明要好回報嘅。曾俊華講得更加清楚。

354
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,050
咁而家你就要個市場去做呢啲噉嘅嘢。

355
01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:01,190
啲基金佬去去去做啲嘢，不過你就哦，你太以前食水太深啦，唔好食水太深。

356
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,380
係咪有病啊？政府！

357
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,820
超支成二千幾億。

358
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:13,520
你攞一千億出嚟做呢一樣嘢啊！即係話做嗰admin啊，同埋做嗰重重整嘅乜乜嘢搞掂啦～

359
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:23,220
即係所以，我主席我就唔會參加呢噉嘅諮詢。即係梁繼昌發言嘅嘢嚟嘅，全部都係shit。好，誒。

360
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:43,510
副秘書長有冇嘢你想回應？誒，多謝梁議員嘅意見。我諗頭先，説嗰部分啦，當然嚇。頭頭先提出好多一啲問題咧，就我諗係超越咗呢條法例嗰個範圍嘅。咁但係就住呢一個預設投資安排咧，我即係想提出一點咧，就係環顧世界咧，其實好多嘅國家咧。

361
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:52,550
都係就住呢個預設投資安排咧，係作出一個改革。噉就唔係淨係香港去做嘅，其實我哋遲咗㗎啦。多謝主席。好，下位阿李卓仁議員。

362
01:16:53,470 --> 01:17:13,480
誒主席就即係我哋成日都覺得根本政府可以再做多啲嘅啊。當然即係其實誒金管局嗰個誒即係外匯基金嘅投資咧，其實應該可以幫埋強積金嗰度畀啲僱員選擇呢個誒即係公共服務嘅一個投資嘅基金咧。我諗更加係。

363
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:33,490
係會即係幫到啲工人嚇，即係我哋成日都覺得就係應該有兩樣嘢嘅一個所謂公共嘅信託人，一個咧就一個係誒公外匯基金掛鈎嘅投資基金產誒投投資嘅一個產品。咁兩樣嘢夾埋就希望可以根本一方面，如果係一個。

364
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:53,500
政府嘅公共嘅信託人本身嚇，噉啊應該係即係嗰個誒行政費係可以降到最低最低嚇，甚至有啲係所謂補貼嘅，咁大家可以再傾到底嗰度點樣做啦。咁但係就而家兩樣都未有，咁即係一方面我哋繼續係覺得即係政府。

365
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,110
都係少收少補。

366
01:17:55,390 --> 01:18:04,420
嚇！唔去面對頭先所講嘅成個嘅基金嘅管理費嘅問題，咁而家基本上係一點七。

367
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:23,430
咁而家你依度話預設誒係去到零點七五噉，等我會再問啦。但係即係依個第一個大問題就，就算如果唔係預設嗰啲，根本喺個市場而家咧個管理費係仍然非常偏高。咁如果你覺得可以做到零點七五，第一個問題就係點解你唔索性立法？

368
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:43,750
撳到係零點七五咧，噉啊更加天都光曬，就唔係淨係預設所有嘅基金都係最多零點七五。如果當然我唔係話一定要求零點七五，因為要計個數。但係既然你呢度做到零點七五，即係代表可以得。第二樣嘢就即係講咗好多啦，即係強積金同遣散費啊個對沖嚇，如果唔取消。

369
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:59,810
其實都係即係揾緊工人笨，噉你哋繼續揾笨，咁然後同我做啲小修小補。噉啊，問翻呢一個誒預設基金嗰度啦。第一個問題頭先我問咗啦，點解唔將成個所有啲撳到零點七五？

370
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:05,040
嚇，直情立法搞掂佢，噉就即係第二樣嘢咧。

371
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:21,220
其實個預設基金，我想澄清一樣嘢，搞搞清楚就係個零點七五係即係睇落咧，就應該係全部嘅行政費啊、投資費啊，乜都包曬嘅嚇。即係我想你澄清依度有個噉嘅誒表喺度啦。咁即係早知。

372
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:41,510
所有啲嘢啊，包括投資嘅費用，因為而家咧通常一點七或者以前係二啦個誒基金嗰個管理費咧，一半到係畀落去做投資嘅費用，一半咧就畀落做一個誒即係行政嘅費用。咁其實即係一路都已經。

373
01:19:41,510 --> 01:20:01,520
係誒揾緊笨咧，就係因為你隨住個資產越嚟越大咧，個行政費仍然咁高咧，其實都係啊，即係唔合理，亦都係畀佢哋賺多咗。不過你哋一路都係畀啲基金，即係或者嗰啲信託人自己、銀行嗰啲係去食啊嚇，噉啊，佢哋都食到好肥㗎啦。咁而家只不

374
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,910
依賴係一個小部分，第日佢哋會遊説啲人咧。

375
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:25,200
就去逃避呢個預設基金，因為逃避到預設基金咧，就可以令到佢哋繼續食嘅。咁所以你唔去立法去監管個零，即係個管理費咧，其實呢個預設基金只係拗下痕嘅啫。咁所以第二個問題，當然頭先我叫佢澄清啦。但係即係第一個問題更加緊要，根本就索性不如立。

376
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:45,210
法嚇撳曬全部所有係零點七五。第三個問題，如果有時間答或者冇時間答，我下一輪啦。就係啊，其實你而家預設基金有個組合嘅，我睇到。咁個組合本身，你哋有冇將過去用依個組合去倒翻轉鋪project？即係如果十年前進入依個。

377
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:56,450
噉嘅組合，十年後嘅今日會大約點樣樣？咁即係可以睇到project，即係預估未來從歷史去睇。咁如果從歷史去睇，

378
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:16,740
誒嗰個預設基金都O K嘅，六廿五歲後O K嘅，咁大家會睇清楚啲，即係知道到底個情況係到底點樣樣。咁可唔可以做一個誒，即係畀我哋睇到過去十年本身，如果我十年前用呢個預設基金到而家嗰個大約嘅情。

379
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:36,750
情況會係點樣樣嚇？三個問題。好，誒副秘書長。係多謝主席。或者我先答一答嘅第一個問題，點解我哋唔會係即係所有嘅基金都有一個收費上限？咁至於關於嗰個回報啊，同埋即係誒嗰個誒呢個誒我哋個管理費用嗰個計法啦，嗰啲細節咧誒啲技術。

380
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:56,760
正問題，我陣間就邀請阿馬順順先生回答。咁首先咧，就係話我哋而家強積金計劃之下咧，我哋即係普遍嚟講咧係有六種基金嘅。咁呢六種基金，我簡單啲講就係話誒一啲誒股票基金咧，就係即係比較係主動型去管理嘅咧，佢嗰個費用咧係必定會高一啲嘅。

381
01:21:56,790 --> 01:22:16,800
而一啲我哋頭先講講過話，即係等於擺喺銀行存款嘅強積金保守基金咧，嗰啲係好好被動嘅。咁嗰個誒管理費咧係必定係好低。咁變咗，我哋如果要真係誒做一個即係所有嘅基金都有一個收費管制上限嘅話咧，我哋可能咧就係要計好多數咧，就係。

382
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:36,810
話每一種類型嘅基金會唔會有一個即係特別嘅一個誒上行嘅，噉啊唔係話唔可以做嘅，咁但係我哋相信咧，就我哋未必需要咧係即係咁快去行呢一步。我哋就相信咧，就係話希望咧，我哋要解決咗件事呢一個預設安排不理想嘅一個情況。首先咧，就引入。

383
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:56,220
喺呢一個即係範疇之下咧，引入一個收費管制。噉我哋唔排除咧，即係將來咧係發展到一個地步咧，我哋要加強嗰個收費管制。但係我哋亦都有信心咧，就係話我哋做咗今次呢一步，我亦都想再講一次咧，我哋喺十五年嘅歷史第一次引入收費管制。

384
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:11,180
我哋希望盡快可以管制咗之後，睇下個市場嘅反應，會唔會有空間再向下調，或者係再點樣去檢討？噉我我唔會沒曬有即係再去有進一步嘅一啲誒誒改善嘅措施嘅。

385
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,280
好，馬成尚先生。

386
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:34,560
Thank you, Chairman. Let me try to address the question about investment performance. I'm always nervous trying to answer questions about investment performance because anything you say is bound to be wrong. Except I can accurately tell you about the history, but what that says about the future is of course very speculative. But it's a good question about what would have happened over the last ten years. I

387
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:54,570
我唔可以畀你數字，因為，我哋有數字關於唔同類型嘅混合資產基金。我哋有，所以對於一個20至40%混合資產基金，即係等於65%基金，喺過去三年嘅回報係3.5%。呢個係有較高嘅費率，當然啦。如果我哋假設嘅費率係，例如。

388
01:23:54,570 --> 01:24:01,580
lower than that over that period, netting out that fee effect would have been about four percent for the higher.

389
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:21,910
Risk fund, the core accumulation fund over the last ten years. If I look at the similar types of funds in the system, then the returns would have been about four point six percent. Again, if you add half a percent lower for fees, you're over five percent on those. Now, of course, I always say those with with huge caveats. Of course, we don't know what will happen in the future, and it's

390
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:41,920
Totally dependent on the financial markets they're invested in. I think it's important though to note the relativities which shouldn't change, and I think we can make some conclusions about relativities. Of course, equity funds have had higher returns over that period, notwithstanding the GFC. So about 5.6% over that period, but pure bond funds are much lower, 2.5%.

391
01:24:41,920 --> 01:25:01,930
所以，The expectation built around that should be not that this is going to deliver four percent or five percent, but that this strategy should deliver something between those two extremes of equity funds and and bond funds. And it also comes with the the special feature about it is because it's built around retirement and access at around age sixty five.

392
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:21,940
所以 reduces risk right at the end, and the objective there is to make sure we know the equity part can go up and down quite a lot, so we want to minimise the impact of that on people just before retirement. So they're the sort of general messages we'd be giving about expectations about the investment outcome, not specific levels, but the relativities to other types of funds.

393
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:27,480
和如何我們 moderating the probability of bad outcomes at the end of the cycle.

394
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:47,770
好，下位潘少平議員。誒，多謝主席。噉啊，我先申報咧，我就係強積金嘅非執行董事。噉就當然咧，而家呢個法案咧，其實就誒，大家都即係可能有唔同睇法。噉啊，基本上我就都原則上係支持，因為事實上誒，對即係以往一路批評。

395
01:25:47,770 --> 01:26:07,780
誒選擇難，收費高。咁而家預整呢個預設基金咧，當然就誒即係希望可以有呢方面嘅改善。咁其實我主要咧就想想了解多少少嘢啫，因為事實上就關於嗰個違規罰則嗰個安排，就誒即係當然而家誒個法案裡面都有誒。

396
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:27,790
有呢個罰則嘅寫法啦。咁其中咧就誒對於嗰個罰誒款嗰個嗰個嗰個內容咧，其實我就唔係好具體瞭解得到，或者一間可以即係希望可以誒政府方局誒解釋一下，因為當然而家誒由一萬至到五萬，有啲係一日，跟住如果再違就二萬噉，其實呢。

397
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:44,810
呢個標準同埋界定咧係誒根據啲咩嘢去定出嚟呢啲數額？噉就誒係咪誒即係嗰個五萬理論上就係以後一路一路噉樣即係計落去，淨係點㗎咧？呢個我想即係進一步瞭解下，就唔該。好，阿副秘書長。

398
01:26:45,230 --> 01:27:05,240
嗯，係多謝主席。噉就嗯冇錯嘅。咁嗰個罰款咧，有啲係定額，嗰啲係定額罰款嚟嘅。咁誒就誒數萬元，噉就係以每一個計劃成員計嘅。噉嘅意思咧就係話，如果佢啊舉個例，嗰個受託人咧冇依照嗰個法例要求咧，係將一啲冇。

399
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:25,250
誒作出選擇嘅誒計劃成員嘅累進權益去轉去呢一個誒預設基金嗰陣時咧，佢就犯咗規啦。咁如果牽涉到係即係十萬個，譬如呢一個誒成員嘅話咧，理論上就個定額罰款成十萬嘅。咁變咗咧嗰個罰款額咧可以去到好高嘅。咁當然咧就唔係話即係咁硬性。

400
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:45,260
咧就咁成咗嗰個成員嘅。我因為我哋喺即係誒普通法下下邊咧，我哋都要考慮咧，任何一啲罰則咧都係要即係誒合理嘅。噉嘅意思就係話，如果嗰個罰啦係會例如令到嗰個誒受罰嘅人咧係造成財政即係誒非常之困難，令佢倒閉嘅話，咁當然。

401
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:53,560
唔會去到嗰個罰則嘅，咁但係所以誒，只係即係好簡單解釋咧，就係話嗰一個定額罰款咧，係以每一個成員計嘅。

402
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:54,920
好。

403
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,230
就誒第一輪嘅，仲有黃毓民議員。

404
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,860
誒，多謝主席。

405
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:09,360
嗱，首先咧，我就即係要申明立場。雖然我加入呢個即係法案委員會咧，咁但係我都係全盤否定呢個強積金計劃。

406
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:17,980
誒呢個條例草案，如果第一，你好似個麥未開，定係未對得對係？我好大聲㗎咯喎。O K，有有嘢聽到啦。O K。

407
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:26,460
噉啊誒，我再講一次咧，即係我新明立場啦。雖然加入呢個法案委員會，但我都仍然係全盤否定呢個強積金計劃嘅。

408
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:36,200
咁呢個條例草案嘅，即係話第日如果恢復二讀表決嘅時候，或者誒喺呢個大會啊誒呢個。

409
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:38,820
表決嘅時候咧，我會。

410
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,410
投反對票嘅。

411
01:28:41,010 --> 01:29:01,020
咁喺呢一個範圍會裏邊咧，我哋都會盡力指出呢個制度嘅唔公道，係嘛？並且喺一個既定事實基礎上邊咧，就繼續為市民爭取最大嘅保障啊。因為噉佢已經係事實嚟㗎嘛。咁好啦，我反對啫。咁而家要修定，噉我梗係要講即係。

412
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,220
有。

413
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:14,270
你嗰個漏洞喺邊度？我哋都要指出嚟嘅係嘛嗱？呢個條例草案咧就旨在引入預設投資策略嘅成分基金，包括核心累積基金同埋六十五歲後基金。

414
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:27,880
並且為佢定出一個法定收費上限。咁而家建議每年咧管理資產嘅零點七五個percent。嗱，預設投資策略基金係適用於冇給予指示嘅計劃成員。

415
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:42,830
噉我想問下副秘書長，點解計劃有計劃成員可以將辛苦揾嚟嘅養老金擺喺企養積金裏邊，但係唔作出指示，咁然後畀你啲基金如取如攜咧？即係呢個邏輯，我真係唔係好明，係咪？

416
01:29:43,340 --> 01:30:03,350
嗱，另外咧就係或者呢個反映咗一個現實啦。嚇，呢啲計劃成員根本就唔想參與呢個強積金計劃，講明係強制性，被逼要參與嘅係嘛。所以對呢個計劃保持不熱衷，亦都灰心嘅態度，咁畀你啲人撳住嚟搶係嘛，即係將啲積積蓄撳住嚟搶啊，同埋亦都選擇逃避對個計劃係。

417
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:09,040
不聞不聞，你咩修訂咩改善，佢都即係完全係誒。

418
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:29,430
唔會關心嘅，咁呢個當然咧就係睇到誒呢個強積金年年虧損，唔好話養老啦，基本連保本都做唔到，係嘛？即係完全違反咗設立強積金嘅政策原意。嗱，部分嗰啲誒基金公司收費高昂，無論佢表現好或者壞，噉啊篤。

419
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:39,870
定收你啲管理費㗎啦，係咪？即係一個咁荒謬嘅制度咧，即係係好奇怪嘅，係咪啊？一個契約自由喺邊度咧？即係喺呢個強積金。

420
01:30:40,330 --> 01:31:00,340
呢一件事上邊或者呢個計劃，咁市民有有冇締約自由咧？請問冇嘅喎，佢唔可以自己決定係唔係參加呢個強積金計劃，幾時終止計劃，或者攞翻啲錢係嘛？甚至乎自定每一個月供款嘅金額同埋其他條款，佢係完全無任何自悔嘅餘地。

421
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:14,460
係咪啊？個計劃本身就係噉樣㗎啦。噉你有政府撐腰，係咪啊？呢個基金公司就不思進取，收費水平就遠高於其他嘅國家。咁呢個就一直以來都引人詬病㗎啦。係咪啊？我哋呢度有好多即係誒。

422
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:34,790
支持基層勞工嘅團體係嘛？其實以前都講咗好多㗎啦。最近一個最有爭議性嘅問題就係取消個對沖嗰個係嘛？咁都有排拗㗎啦。呢個係嗱，政府就話咧不適宜同海外啲成熟退休基金制度嘅收費直接相比噉，但係香港嘅強積金計劃喺二千年到而家已經實。

423
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:38,600
資咗十五年，到今日都唔成熟啊！

424
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,600
十五年都仲未成熟。

425
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:52,430
咪如果係噉嘅話，即係話，因為政府冇開放呢個退休金市場啊嘛，使到呢啲經營強積金嘅基金公司無需面對市場嘅挑戰，缺乏自我改善同埋控制成本嘅動力。

426
01:31:52,710 --> 01:32:12,720
即金局喺二零一一年委聘呢個獨立顧問公司進行呢個成本嘅研究，即金局按照研究嘅結果咧，就提出四點建議嘅，係嘛？咁呢啲建議啊，包括咧誒敦誒敦促受託人為每個計劃提供唔同種類嘅低收費基金或者推廣基呢個基金。第二咧就協助受託人進一步。

427
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:18,430
自動化同埋簡化行政程序，合併規模較小或者成效較低嘅計劃。

428
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:29,040
第三咧就協助計劃成員整合個人嘅帳户，第五、第四咧就係喺核准成分基金嘅程序中咧，就推廣呢個所謂指數基金啊。

429
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:49,530
嗱，即係呢一個誒建議咧，係嘛？咁嚟調低呢個所謂誒相關建調低個收像強積金收費，咁啲基金公司可以遲到遲頓到咧，連個成本增加競爭力佢都唔會研究嘅，要你積金局去教路，教佢點樣做生意係咪好？

430
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:50,390
笑咧話。

431
01:32:51,490 --> 01:33:11,500
足足十五年啊！政府當局先至開始就強積金收費高昂提出改善嘅措施，其實已經係太遲。而呢個條例草案咧，只係就預設投資策略嘅成分基金收費上限作出規定，其他計劃咧依然係不受監管，政策依然係向業界傾斜。我哋係絕對。

432
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,650
最不能接受。

433
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:17,130
最後我想講嘅咧，就係其中六十五歲後基金。

434
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:26,310
主要淨值誒呢個淨資產值大約七十五至八十五個percent會投資喺風險較低嘅資產，例如一啲環球證券。

435
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:36,380
眾所周知，呢啲噉嘅證券係屬於長線投資，回報穩定。基金公司投資喺債券差唔多，係乜都唔使做。

436
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,380
噉你憑乜嘢？

437
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:51,050
每年管理資產嘅零點七五個percent做回報咧？請問係嘛？即係呢個管理資產嘅零點七五個percent收費咧，仍然係屬於高水平嘅。我哋要爭取佢咧係下調係嘛？

438
01:33:51,330 --> 01:34:06,690
嗱，我咧就即係呢段主要嘅發言就先申明我喺呢個即係法案委員會嘅立場嘅啫。咁其他嗰啲相關嘅問題咧，誒，將來我哋會喺法案委員會裏邊繼續去提出嘅。多謝主席。好啊，呢個意見嚟嘅嚇，就誒，鐘國斌議員。

439
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:07,860
都係一點。

440
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,160
嗯。

441
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:22,300
大家聽過就係因為而家市場嗰啲強積金基金咧個收費高啊！而而家平均去到一點七個percent，咁當然呢個預設基金咧就會降到去零點七五。

442
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:32,250
咁但係，如果喺個市場嘅動力嚟講咧，即係如果你一個管理費，你預算基金係去到零點七，係平過市場一般嘅。

443
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:42,720
誒強積金嘅基金嘅話咧，你預計咧就會一個好大嘅誒轉移，由市場嗰啲一點七五去到你要啲預設基金嗰度。

444
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:52,870
噉啊，政府有冇預計即係嗰個轉移咧？嗰個百分比會去到幾多啊？嗱，以英國嘅我嘅嘅例子咧，可以去到六七十個percent。

445
01:34:53,150 --> 01:35:13,160
嗱，當然去到六七十percent嘅話咧，啲基金嗰個金額細咗咁多咧，佢都焗住可能會減價去去去搶翻啲生意。係咪你預期咧？即係呢個誒市場嘅一點七五咧，可以市場一點七嘅，可以最終可能會跟得到。

446
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:22,750
接近你嗰個誒預貼基金嘅管理費去到零貼，即係到時咧，你哋可能就有資格再減落去。呢個係咪你哋嘅預期？

447
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:43,830
誒副秘書長，係主席。誒首先而家我哋定呢一個管理費嘅上限零點七五咧，如果我哋睇翻現有即係強積金計劃之下四百幾個基金咧，就大概有十一個咧係即係係有呢一個零點七五或者係以下嘅。咁所以咧就即係我哋呢個水平咧係都我哋覺得係幾有挑戰。

448
01:35:43,830 --> 01:36:03,840
成嘅對於誒一啲受託人嚟講，咁誒頭先提到就係話，如果外國經驗會唔會有好多即係轉移去呢一個誒越市投資安排咧？噉我哋就誒好難做一個估計啦。即係香港個情況同外國情況係有幾多誒類似？但係頭先我都講過咧，就睇翻外國嘅經驗咧，推出咗有規管嘅越

449
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:23,850
涉投資安排咧，係會令即係幾吸吸引一啲誒計劃成員咧，佢唔識揀或者唔想揀咧，係去參加嘅。咁而亦都係即係正如頭先啊，鐘議員有講係會令到個市場咧係有一個轉變，譬如就係話一啲基金佢如果係細，即係因為啲資產轉移咗去呢一個預設頭先安排。

450
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:43,860
個基金規模細咗，就會即係會取取消啊、整合啊噉樣。咁呢個亦都係即係會去對嗰個市場整體嗰個收費咧，我哋相信係一個即係好嘅影響嚟嘅啊。因為如果有一個即係誒市場嘅整合咧，誒就頭頭先我哋所講嘅規模效益可以出到嚟。噉啊，亦都係點解我哋會覺得即係用。

451
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:51,060
一個市場為本咧，亦都可以達至到某某個程度上咧，係有一啲市場嘅效益嘅。噉我唔知誒。

452
01:36:51,400 --> 01:37:11,410
達唔達到話中議員嘅問題，需唔需要有呢一啲補充？係張國斌議員，唔係即係呢呢呢個我梗明白，因為你市場力量啊嘛。但係即係政府，你可以定得到零點七五作為呢一個上限嘅管理費嘅話咧，你必定會影響咗個市場，其他嘅持份者或者啲基金經理咧，佢為咗。

453
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:17,520
誒攞翻啲生意翻嚟嘅話咧，佢必定要降低個管理費。而家最最大嘅，

454
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:37,810
誒畀人救病嘅問題就係呢個佢哋個管理費貴啊嘛，咁噉我相信你一定會預計咗預計得到一個轉移係會去到誒幾大個百分比係誒多謝主席，係正如我哋喺諮詢文件嘅第第五十段嗰個提到。

455
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:57,820
其實我哋有一個咧，就係叫做即係指標考型，即係我哋定咗一個零點七五之後。咁其實喺同一個即係強積金計劃之下，大家諗到咧一啲人生階段類似嘅基金咧，佢如果收費咧係即係高過零點七五，而回報同我哋呢一個弱積金安排差唔多嘅話咧，佢一必定係有壓力咧。

456
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:17,830
係向下調嘅，咁所以就係話我哋相信咧，呢一個月節投資安排嘅一個收費上限咧，係會令到整體市場咧都係有個壓力。而事實上咧，我哋喺今年咧，即係如果大家有留意嘅話咧，其實今年誒一月咧一個即係強積金計劃嘅其中一個重要嘅受託人咧，已經係即係主動。

457
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:37,840
降價啊！即係我相信，我估就係咁講啦。相信係回應咗我哋，即係將會推出呢一個即係預預設投資安排。咁但係呢個個規模嗰個轉移有幾多咧？即係我哋而家就我諗係好難做一個即係誒誒一個判斷嘅啊，或者做一個預測咯。噉我哋相信希望即係推出咗二次投資安排。

458
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:44,650
誒有數年嘅時間咧，反而再即係可以有相關嘅數據，可以提交翻畀委員會參考。

459
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:54,010
主席，即係我哋睇下，如果英國例子，當佢推出呢個預設基金之後，是佢用幾耐時間去到而家去到六七成嗰個比例。

460
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,250
啊。

461
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:17,760
好，馬成順先。I should say one one has to be very cautious with the data from the UK because there's no official data. There is some research work. Whilst we get figures that the number of defaulters in the UK, or about sixty to seventy percent of members default, that was probably not a matter of transfers. That relates to new money.

462
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:33,030
There are similar dynamics in a market I know a little bit more about in Sweden, where an impressive figure of 90% of new money goes into defaults. But that's new money of pre-existing money, much lower. Very little that was actually invested outside of it.

463
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:53,460
transition，但係，some people do。It's important to provide that opportunity， but I suspect most of the flow won't come from people who have made decisions to go into other funds， but it will come in the future. People joining the scheme going forward， when presented with the option set， which is you don't have to make a choice， or you can choose the DIS or choose between all these funds。

464
01:39:53,480 --> 01:40:02,340
The natural behavioural outcome of that is people tend to take the easy option. If they're told they don't have to make a choice, they tend not to. So I expect that we'll see that.

465
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:09,370
That impact takes time. We'll have the transition that all the current people will move over, subject to opting out.

466
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:15,550
But I think this will be a major impact on people as they join schemes going forward. So we'll see this accelerate over time.

467
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:36,120
好，下位阿冼仲佳議員第二輪嗱。主席其實咧，頭先誒，我第一次問嘅時候，你唔係好準確答，因為我其實我想問數字噉，你咧就誒答阿鄧家彪議員嘅時候，都係講嗰個所謂個survey，即係關於有幾多誒呢一個誒潛在嘅。

468
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:45,140
嘅數量係會轉移到咧一個，即係將來如果法律通過咗之後，嗰個嘅預設基金噉樣樣。噉我唔知道你哋喺現有嘅。

469
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:55,360
條件之下咧，係咪可以？誒，其實我嘅問題都係跟進翻鄧家彪嘅問題，可唔可以有個統計嘅數字？即係唔係佢問嗰啲人？

470
01:40:55,670 --> 01:41:15,680
嚇做唔做到嘅咧？噉樣樣即係因為到到真係生效嘅時候，究竟有幾多人咧？即係嗰啲嗰啲人誒，邊個人要被撥去嘅時候，其實應該應該到時應該要知嘅咯，係嘛？唔係話口啱噏嘅啦嘛，係嘛？噉我哋幾時可以take一個清楚嘅snapshot？

471
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:30,310
有幾多個數字？數字包括有幾多個呢啲個户口嘅基金嘅嘅投資可以匯撥入去，然之後咧就係相關係有幾多誒嘅投資嘅誒嘅價值喺度。

472
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:32,390
誒，並未想答。

473
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:34,480
啊，馬成信先生。

474
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:36,710
Thank you, Chairman.

475
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:57,800
It's certainly the case that once the trustees know what the test is, they can go and find the information. And as I indicated in response to an earlier question, we've given them a time frame within which to find out exactly the information you've asked—the number of members, the number of counts, the number of dollars—that fall into the category of people who will get the notice—and we'll have a time.

476
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:11,720
時間frame，within which they deliver that，well in advance of the law starting。if that's to start at the end of next year，sometime in the first half next year，they'll have to do that work。when Mr Sindraguy talks of a survey，we have done。

477
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:26,770
Member surveys of this in the past, but we know they're incredibly unreliable because people actually forget what they've done. So it's a matter of going through the records of the trustee systems, and they will be doing that work. And we'll have those figures in the first half next year, well in advance of implementation.

478
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:47,340
誒，你你你係咪你話出年先有？點解唔而家可以做到相關嘅統計咧？即係我唔知道嗱，我哋我哋呢個範圍唔會都阿朱迪，即係都有正常啲兩三個月啊，先係搞得掂㗎。係咪可以而早啲可以問呢一個所謂誒？

479
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:52,230
嗰啲誒誒，信託人可以做嗰啲統計數字畀我哋個法案委員會咧。

480
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,720
係馬成信先生。

481
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:16,010
嗯，yes， sure， we we can ask them to do estimates on the basis of the work they've already done. Yes， we can do that. We can provide some figures。啊，主席，我我諗過啦，我誠肯希望，我頭先我都雖然唔係單單一我作為一個其中一個成員，我雖然有其他包括鄧家彪佢哋都有問，我希望一啲即係客觀啲嘅統計數字，即係嚟自呢一個強積金。

482
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:36,020
佢哋管理局，佢哋要求啲信託人交畀佢哋。咁然之後咧，就誒希望你哋做一啲aggregate啦。我唔係要一啲個別人士點樣投資嘅方法，係要一個整體嘅數字噉樣樣。噉你我我相信喺最好，你喺我哋發委員會員之前交到畀我哋啦。嚇，好嘛？好，副秘書長，你跟進啦，嚇，好嘛？

483
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:37,190
誒。

484
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:39,540
仲有第二輪嘅有李卓然。

485
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:45,520
誒主席，即係其實咧，跟住落去會發生咩事咧？我哋都可以估下。

486
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:52,470
誒第一樣嘢咧就係誒當個，因為你有兩個選擇畀啲人嘅到時。

487
01:43:52,760 --> 01:44:12,770
即係意思係誒一啲係冇而家冇任何投資誒，即係誒誒計劃嗰啲咧，你就會畀四廿二日去去揀，話進入呢一個嘅誒，即係新嘅投誒預設基金啦。咁但係有第二類人嘅，第二類人咧就係已經。

488
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:32,780
有投資選擇嗰啲，佢都可以揀入嚟依個預設基金㗎。咁所以兩類人噉，你哋嘅資訊嘅方面係老實講，我覺得要同啲誒信託人比賽嘅嚇，同埋要清晰嗱。因為好多時依啲噉嘅情況咧，所謂資訊不不平衡嚇，咁好多時啲人。

489
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:50,800
唔清晰咧，就好容易畀誒啲即係信託人嘅誒誒誒，即係去做一啲嘅推銷嘅工作，係令到咧佢誒可能去揀啲預設基金，因為我覺得預設基金最大嘅吸引當然係零點七五個部分。

490
01:44:51,530 --> 01:45:11,540
因為你而家一點七五嘅話咧，同零點七咪爭一個percent，即係你嘅投資回報畀人食一點一個，即係食硬嘅咧一點七五就如果食硬零點七五咧，起碼少一個percent啦。咁所以依個係一個當然成單嘢最大吸引嘅地方。噉我哋啊覺得係即係應該畀啲人有個清。

491
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:31,550
嘅信息去選擇噉，所以我要問咧，就係啊，佢哋而家有個位咧，就係畀啲人四廿二日啊。咁如果四廿日唔答覆咧，就會自動入去啦。但係如果四廿日，即係佢當然有個遊説嘅時間，四廿二日。但係如果啲係已經喺個計劃裏邊有選擇嗰啲人，你又會幾時去同佢哋去講？

492
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:51,560
嗱，而家我哋啊，某年某月開始就會可以畀你去揀呢個預設基金啦。咁嗰個你哋都會做㗎，因為你度好似淨係講畀嗰啲係誒冇選擇誒計劃嗰啲人，而係已經有而家現有計劃啲人，你哋會點樣去做呢個宣傳咧？呢個第一個問題。第二頭先我有問一樣嘢去。

493
01:45:51,560 --> 01:46:06,130
佢未答嘅或者澄清嘅啫，係咪零點七五就係包曬全包嚇？即係冇冇唔會再多零點七五㗎啦嚇？定係有啲數我哋冇睇清楚嘅？咁而家不如講埋佢，咁清清楚楚噉樣嚇，唔該。好。

494
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:10,280
誒邊位想答？阿馬馬成信先生。

495
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:30,880
Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Leatrice Young makes the good point that there are different groups here to consider and their behaviours will be different. The transition, which is on this screen, is is your right directed at those people who fall into this category of not not having made a choice, and so they get a specific notice which says unless they do something, they end up in the DIs. So

496
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:50,890
They get a chance to opt out. So it's not opt in, it's opt out. And unless they do something, then they will end up in the DIs. He rightly makes the point that there's a much bigger group of members who've already made a choice, so that transition process does not affect them. But he is right that we need to make sure that all of those people are aware of this new arrangement, and they're.

497
01:46:50,890 --> 01:47:10,900
aware of the relative benefits and issues to be considered in it, and to think about whether it's right for them, because they have the ability to opt in. They can at any time go in and tick the box to say I want to be in this new thing. What we're doing in that respect, of course, is we, in addition to our normal education and publicity pre-implementation, we are working towards.

498
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:28,510
提供Exactly what you just indicated a standardised set of information that will go out to all members, not just those who are in this transitional category, but will go to every member, telling them that this new thing is around, what it's about, what the risks and probable returns are in a generalised sense.

499
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:48,800
pointing out the advantages which will be the fee cap, and telling them that if they want to, they can opt into it by going and making a fund choice. So, the timing on that, we think that should go out about three months before the start date. But that is information that can be updated progressively as we go forward. But we agree that is an important issue to keep in mind that this.

500
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:55,380
This is an option for those people who are not defaulters as well, but and they should consider this as something new and consider whether it's right for them.

501
01:47:56,090 --> 01:48:01,490
誒咁澄清嗰個cap係咪零點七五就冇再低冇多啲其他嘢？

502
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,720
誒馬成信先啦。

503
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:26,850
yes,the fee cap the point seven five is the upper limit on the management fees that are set out in the provision itself. so for those management fees related to any of those functions and they they can they cannot be charged unless they fall under the point seven five and it's only those types of fees that can be charged. so

504
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:46,860
Trustee administrator, investment manager, sponsor and promoter, custodian for the non transaction ones. But most importantly, we also uplift those similar things from underlying funds, so that also falls within this 0.75. And that's important to keep in mind when when people look to comparatives for this. The UK's got a fee cap.

505
01:48:46,860 --> 01:49:06,870
0.75， but this doesn't extend to the underlying investments in the same way ours does. So ours is actually more restrictive than some of the comparatives that we look at. And and that's has to be built in both the administration and the cost dynamics of making these things work. So there will not never not be any more investment fee so-called. So only a ministry.

506
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:13,090
Investment fee all capped at 0.75. Yes, the investment manager's fee is part of that.

507
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:18,160
好誒，最後一位就係第三輪嘅鄧家彪議員。

508
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:38,640
誒，多謝主席。誒，即係剩翻好少時間咧，我我諗咧，即係誒辯論亦都未必適宜，而係希望即係有一個誒，即係下次會議嗰陣時能夠交多啲資料。呢啲資料就係即係幫我哋進一步去預示究竟個效果係點。誒，我諗第一係個表現上面咧，我。

509
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:58,650
聽到頭先副秘書長講話，會將外國已經用呢個誒投資模式去做佢哋個預設基金嘅一啲國家嘅例子。我我我相信你嘅例子係包括羅列咗佢嘅表現同埋收費同埋規模啊，以及咧可能我哋好多議員都關心話，究竟人哋有幾多個計劃先？我哋有三十八個。

510
01:49:58,650 --> 01:50:10,220
我聽到人哋係點樣咧？希望你有個誒羅列畀我哋睇，收費表現啊，有幾多個參與嘅嘅嘅嘅計劃，以及有幾多即係誒資產。

511
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:30,510
誒第二個咧就係話誒第二個表現就係話咧，你而家咧呢一個噉嘅誒股債環球嘅一個投資策略，其實我估咧現時即係我喺你哋都頭先應該都有確認，現時五百幾隻成分基金已經係有啲係咁㗎啦。我想即係你睇下，你哋可唔可能即係可能你？

512
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:50,520
你哋有難度啦，但係你哋唔唔開名，但係你抽幾隻可能資產額去到咁上下嘅啊？基金A、基金B、基金C現存喺強積金裡面嘅，就係呢種投資策略。究竟實質可能三年回報係點，五年回報係點？報畀我哋去睇咯。你唔肯做保證回報啊嘛？噉你起碼畀啲參。

513
01:50:50,520 --> 01:51:04,740
考畀我哋去睇下，究竟呢一啲即係現存喺強積金裡面已經有嘅，即係股債有個環球嗰個個分配嘅一個嘅嘅嘅投資嘅表現係點，同埋佢嘅收費好唔好啊？

514
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:18,010
第三咧，對於保證基金，我係有疑慮嘅，因為保證基金咧應該係有六隻係作為預設基金。我頭先啱check過咧，有一隻係接近一百億嘅資產嘅。

515
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:38,300
另外有兩隻咧，都係十幾億、四啊幾億，有啲好細嘅幾億嘅啫。噉我就想知緊呢六隻保證基金，既然你話我唔轉移㗎噉樣，咁究竟佢哋係咪呢個合約係綁一世嘅咧？定係可唔可能具體去瞭解一下？究竟係咪即係你哋永遠唔會掂呢一？

516
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:56,630
筆錢永遠唔會協助呢一批人咧，因為保險基金嘅表現係唔理想嘅，同埋希望你亦都可以披露咧，下次披露究竟呢六隻保證基金現實，我頭先話近一百億啊，有一隻究竟係咪真咧？你哋可唔可以羅列出嚟畀我哋委員去了解咧？

517
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:03,080
嗯，誒頭先李卓人亦都係我一開始問嘅問題，就個收費，因為我留意到咧，你誒。

518
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,310
嗰個啊標裡面咧。

519
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:25,600
三十四D.C.咧，誒第二點咧就講咗啦，呢啲係誒擺入個規範就係零點七五，但係第三點咧就冇擺落個規範度嘅。如果我冇理解錯誤，即係話一啲就關乎設立該基金或該基金清盤的服務而收取或私家的，就唔會擺。

520
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:45,610
去零點七五個規範嗰度嘅，亦都有個咧係就保管人所提供嘅服務而收取或私加嘅，亦都唔會擺落去咧呢個零點七五嘅。你哋可唔可能羅列一張清單，究竟有啲乜嘢係唔會擺落去嗰個規管收費嗰嗰個嗰個位置度而？

521
01:52:45,610 --> 01:53:05,620
譬如你哋又攞幾隻強積金做例子，唔開名，究竟呢啲存在嘅收費、存在嘅開支，究竟係真係使咗幾多錢啊？大概咩比例，畀我哋有個概念好冇？因為到時咧真係雷聲大雨點小，原來有個活門咧，畀受託人咧喺另一個item度咧去。

522
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:18,290
又去開單，噉啊根本上咧就毀咗你哋一番心血，亦都即係都係嗰句啦。我哋對強積金嘅信心咧會越嚟越差嘅。咁希望你哋羅列出嚟，同埋啲例子説明呢度究竟係佔幾多錢。

523
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,570
誒，另外咧就係誒。

524
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:40,130
嗰個強積金嗰個監管個力度啊，即係積金局監管嘅力度喺呢啲噉嘅受誒誒誒核心基金底下，同傳統或者一直做開嗰五百幾隻嘅誒誒成分基金，你哋係有權審批佢出唔出現，但係佢出現咗之後咧。

525
01:53:40,410 --> 01:54:00,420
基本上你冇咩管到佢㗎啦，即係我講表現又好，收費又好，誒，希望我講嘅係理解係冇錯啦嚇。咁對比起呢種噉嘅情況，同對比起未來會出現嘅嗰個核心基金，你哋個監管嗰個分別喺邊度？可唔可以有一啲誒，即係簡單？

526
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:20,430
耳名啊，而家叫懶人包啦，有啲比較表畀我哋，即係比較清晰噉樣知道，即係避免我哋就對你哋冇信心啊！你哋一雙程設計好啦，原來係冇特別嘅法例賦予你哋做好個監管，即係呢啲我都希望你哋可以喺誒下一次嘅會議裏。

527
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:29,410
裡面能夠有呢啲嘅資料嘅，畀翻我哋好。誒副秘書長，我我哋將會跟進可唔可以做咧？係可以畀到畀大家嗯。

528
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,570
好，阿馬成信先啊。

529
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:40,740
Perhaps, chairman, if I can just respond to Mr Tang's question on the returns, we do have that information. Perhaps Mr Tang was.

530
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:42,800
not in the room at the time, but

531
01:54:43,110 --> 01:55:03,120
I can provide it. We can provide it for the next meeting. But just to reiterate what I said earlier, the for the looking at similar types of funds for the a mixed asset fund of 20 to 40% equity, their return over the last 10 years has been about 3.5%. If you strap out some of the fees, say another half percent, so they've got about 4%. For the higher risk

532
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:23,130
ones they're more in the range of four six at another half so a bit over five the relativities for those are equity funds are of course higher they were five six and you're right we do have bond funds not many and they're quite small but their returns annualised over the last ten years have been two five and of course we've got the fees so we'll provide you

533
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:39,220
table of those return figures over the last 10 years. I repeat the point though that that is a poor indicator of how they might perform in absolute terms over the next 10 years, but should be a good indicator how they'll perform relative to each other as a class.

534
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:59,510
On the guarantee fund one, sure we can give you some data. A couple of points to make though. I think the the big one you're referring to is probably one that's not affected by the exemption, and the exemption only applies at a member level. It doesn't apply to the whole fund. So it will be every member in that fund, if it's the default, will get a notice anyway. And it's only if for that.

535
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:18,170
particular member， the value of the guarantee is worth more than they get without the guarantee that they're exempted， so it's member level， so it's not the whole fund that's going to be exempted， every member if it's the default will get the notice and go through the process anyway， but we can provide you the global figures about the size of those funds and which ones are affected。

536
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:34,250
好，今日誒嘅會議時間係差唔多啦。我想喺呢度咧就講埋下一次會議嘅日期。噉啊，根據秘書處幫我哋咧就係誒計算咗咧，就準備喺二零一六年。

537
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,000
啊！即係明年嘅一月十一號。

538
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:57,540
就係做嗰個公聽會嚇，就畀各個團體代表啊誒嚟表達意見。咁咪準備上午九時至到十二點半。噉我哋到時睇睇有幾多代表嘅人數嚟的嚇。噉啊，我哋再喺公聽會之後，我哋再安排多兩次會議。
