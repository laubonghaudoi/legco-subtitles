12
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:20,500
O.K.噉我哋先請西九代表。Morning, thanks, Mr. Chairman. Very pleased to be here today for what will be my last time appearing before Legco. So I'd like to welcome the deputations and welcome the members of the the subcommittee. Can I just start?

13
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,770
我先由説一聲特別謝謝，各位委員及各位委員。

14
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:46,060
in particular for their support of the funding application that went through the public works and the finance committees last week. It clearly puts us in a position to continue the project, in particular Artist Square M Plus, the Lyric Theatre and the Park project, and we very much appreciate.

15
00:03:46,060 --> 00:04:06,070
Both the rigorous questioning of what we've been doing, but the opportunity now to be able to move those projects forward. So I particularly thank all of you for your support in what has been a challenging time. As I said, this is my last time in front of the.

16
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:26,080
Committee, and we wanted to take the opportunity to update the work on capacity building and stakeholder management. I have with me the respected Dr Lars Nitver, leader of the M Plus project, and Anna Chan, one of the great products of the performing arts in Hong Kong, who is our head of artistic development in dance.

17
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:46,090
Who is representing Louis Yu? Who is not with us today? He's out of town. I think you can see from the presentations that we'll put up to you today that we've done a lot of things looking at the professional development for artists, the development of cultural leaders in Hong Kong.

18
00:04:46,090 --> 00:05:06,100
looking at being able to get more and new arts managers, grooming junior administrators and and helping emerging artists come out, opening up some of the opportunities which we see as really important to the development of West Kaloum in terms of people want

19
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:19,100
particularly young people wanting to pursue a career in the arts, and you know our big aim of being able to ensure that we involve the broadest membership of the Hong Kong community in terms of our project.

20
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:31,600
We see capacity building as both equally important in sustaining the development, as well as the collateral benefits it has in terms of arts and cultural development in Hong Kong.

21
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:52,110
In terms of stakeholder engagement, the consultation panel, which we discussed at the last meeting when we were here with the Chief Secretary and Chairman of the West Kalim board, Carrie Lam, remains a very important part of our communication and exchanges. Unfortunately, Ada Wong was going to be with us today, but she's ill. But we

22
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:12,120
We welcome Yolanda Ng, who are here today as who are both members of the consultation panel. We've obviously had significant involvement over the last year in terms of the different stakeholders, both in looking at the development of projects like the Lyric Theatre project, but

23
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:23,470
more broadly in trying to inform the Hong Kong community about progress, and clearly you know you can see that progress now, and it's I think a significant step forward.

24
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:43,760
We're very glad to now hear views from the stakeholders, and very happy to be able to answer questions that you may have after your presentations. And I'd now like to effectively thank my colleagues from both HAB and from WKCD, in particular.

25
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:51,780
Lars and Anna for to be able to do this presentation, and to say thank you and goodbye.

26
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,250
唔係。

27
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,270
啊，你你話為甚？

28
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,740
非常感謝主席。

29
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,420
呃。

30
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,330
sorry for that.

31
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:24,410
In addition to what CEO has said here, I think I should reflect a little bit just on what I've noticed working on this project for five years now. That probably this is a world unique project in terms of exactly what we're talking about today: capacity building and stakeholder engagement. I don't think there is any project.

32
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:44,420
Anywhere in the world of this scale, where you so many years before you actually have the actually institutions venues up and running, where you put in so much work to actually build the environment around, and of course also in the future inside these these venues or institutions.

33
00:07:44,420 --> 00:08:04,430
From an M Plus perspective, just like to mention some of the less visible things. These are of course you see our exhibitions and talks and so forth. But but there are lots of other things going on as well, especially on the on the capacity building side. We have.

34
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:24,440
Since a number of years, an internship programme that has been running that does two intakes per year, and at the present we take in three interns each half year to come and sort of be embedded in the project. And of course, this is really these are our students.

35
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:44,450
With some work experience as well, and they come in to and of course learn from being part of the process simply, and that's proven to be very actually beneficial for us because it puts us in touch with young practitioners in our field, but also of course.

36
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,200
I think very helpful from the report they gave and the end reports they gave to them.

37
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:10,690
We have another separate internship programme which is related to when we, together with ADC, do the and organise the Venice Biennial. So it's every second year, where we have a much more extensive but shorter period of time internship programme.

38
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:30,700
which involves actually ten exhibition interns who then work with the exhibition. We also do something that is quite unusual. We bring in young technicians, practical people who work with exhibition building and installing exhibition, and give them an international experience.

39
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:50,710
因為那係一個重要部分，當然，而且亦都有兩個副館長職位在這個項目中，所以香港年輕的館長也可以得到這個國際曝光的機會。這亦係第二次我們做這個，亦係第二次我們做威尼斯雙年展。

40
00:09:50,710 --> 00:10:04,340
This time representing Sanquinwa to great acclaim in Venice, and I think it's a very happy arrangement for both the interns and for us as an organisation.

41
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:25,610
We have a very, also very successful and quite ambitious volunteer docent programme. These are volunteers. They come from different walks of life in Hong Kong, working with different work and education backgrounds, who have come on volunteer bases and joined forces with us to then.

42
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:45,620
When we do programmes and exhibitions, be the docents those who mediate between the exhibition and the audiences, do docent tours, guided tours in the exhibitions and so forth. And we have had since a couple of years back, we've had a group of forty-seven docents who have worked with.

43
00:10:45,620 --> 00:11:05,630
And they get regular training from us, and we're going to expand this further, rename it actually to the M Plus Mediator Programme in the beginning of next year, and expand the numbers in preparation for the opening of the art pavilion in July August next year.

44
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,380
Furthermore, we are.

45
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:15,390
在準備階段，要發射M+Lab。An M+Lab是。

46
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:36,210
pretty fantastic. I wish I had drawings of it as well. But a tailor-made trailer that can function as an exhibition space, as a stage, as a workshop, and which will travel together with artists and designers out to and educators, of course, out to schools to bring new.

47
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,590
unique type of learning experience to teachers and students.

48
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:53,600
So that's going to happen in. It's going to be launched in in the end of the year, but we are in the preparation stages now and actually building the actual vehicle as well.

49
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:03,530
next week we start or the summer camp called Unframed takes place in.

50
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:23,850
The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups Jockey Club Sai Kung Outdoor Training Camp. That's a mouthful, but it brings hundreds secondary school students actually out of a large. We had to choose them out of a much larger group of applicants to this camp for.

51
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:43,860
四四天和三夜，一起與一羣大學志工協助他們，和一羣藝術家、設計師等，頂尖的藝術家和設計師及建築師從香港，會在這段期間與他們合作。這個想法是為了建立。

52
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:58,850
長遠關係與這羣，或至少是最關心這羣，所以我們會有，一種參考羣體的年輕人，會成為我們未來思考什麼是M+應該是。

53
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,410
嗯。

54
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:21,700
also we have a visiting artist programme which is really bringing artists from different parts of the world, matching them, bringing them together both with the M+ team and the West Kowloon team, but also with artists and designers and so forth here in Hong Kong to sort of broaden the contact.

55
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:41,710
Base for also for Hong Kong artists, but also to bring to make artists from overseas understand the special circumstances and conditions in Hong Kong. So this is something that so far we've had seven practitioners, filmmakers, visual art.

56
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,360
Has been here, and this is a continuing programme.

57
00:13:46,830 --> 00:14:06,840
much smaller project. It's just one person per year. Is the Design Trust Fellowship Programme, which is funded by Hong Kong Ambassadors of Design or their Design Trust, and it brings in one researcher, one scholar who comes and.

58
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:26,850
spends time in Hong Kong to study one particular aspect at the time. In this case, the mainland architecture historian Fan Ling, who has been here over this year, and to do research on the relationship between Hong Kong architecture.

59
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:37,180
和發展現代建築在在中國大陸，特別是八十年代，這是一個非常重要但未被研究的時期。

60
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:52,450
This is more public and these are things that some of you may have attended, which is M plus matters, which is at least has one side which is public, which is.

61
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:12,830
A public discussion seminar, but it also has another side where we invite, of course, our own staff, but also key members of the professional community, depending on the subject, to come and discuss with theorists or

62
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:25,280
practitioners and so often from overseas and different from different parts of the world, really to bring more expertise to our discussions about specific aspects of the future M+.

63
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,660
嗯。

64
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
And then, of course, we have, excuse me.

65
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:50,670
We have our public forum, which is really truly a public forum where we invite anyone who wants to come. We advertise and to come and listen to presentations of, as we like to say, where we are and where we're going in terms of the collection, buildings, other things, but also.

66
00:15:50,670 --> 00:16:08,020
Ask questions. So the question-asking period is usually just as long as the presentation part. So usually at least an hour of questions, and this happens with a certain regularity, at least once a year, often more regularly than that.

67
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:29,740
We have also, of course, organised our our different exhibitions, which and other programmes, which which is our way of meeting the wider audience and building capacity. So we had during the last year, since I was here last to see you, I guess.

68
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:49,750
至少啲啲 delegations， the neon signs， mobile M+， they're all called mobile M+ neon signs .dot HK， which was partly digital and partly physical and focused on the phenomenal history and presence of neon signs in Hong Kong， and that has also now

69
00:16:49,750 --> 00:17:02,650
Being a part, become a part of the Google Cultural Institute to engage global audiences in in the sort of understanding of Hong Kong neon signs and its history.

70
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:23,570
Another exhibition which took place during the spring was Mobile M Plus Moving Images, focus on focusing on our interest in, of course, moving images, film, video and so forth. A very celebrated and appreciated exhibition which took place.

71
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,690
在兩個展覽場館。

72
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,300
and at the Broadway Cinematheque.

73
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:50,300
We also did, as I mentioned, the Venice Biennial. Sanking Wise being presented this year, and Digital M Plus, which is in preparation for launching later in the year. Which is really a digital platform, like the digital platform of the museum. Because of course we build a building, but we also build a digital platform.

74
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,230
所以係某啲非常非常重要，當然呢啲日子。

75
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:12,970
And I don't think we should forget that we have now actually there are 25 curators of different age and different seniority out there all the time visiting studios, talking to artists, designers, architects, going to openings and so forth. So we are constantly

76
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:24,730
ten or times every week we are in studios and and in in workshops and meeting people so and giving talks sitting in in panels and so forth so the sort of

77
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,830
The surface where M plus meets its stakeholders is very, very wide and quite intense.

78
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,140
所以那係我有要報告嘅嘢。

79
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:54,780
誒主席同埋各位早晨，噉我今日咧就代表行政總監阿馮國烈咧，同大家誒一齊分享下我哋喺個表演藝術部嗰度咧，喺過往嘅一年喺人才培訓各方面同埋藝術嗰個發展去做咗啲咩工作嘅。

80
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:15,970
咁其中一個誒一個重點嘅工作咧，就係喺誒二零一三年開始，我哋就同藝術發展局咧一齊合辦咗一個叫做本地藝團領導領袖人才海外考察同埋培訓計劃嘅。咁由二零一三年去到二零一五年咧，我哋一共咧就誒邀請咗五。

81
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:35,980
五位嘅藝術家啦，咁有包括而家坐喺度嘅誒香港話劇團嘅樑子琪啦，另外進劇場嘅紀文信啦，誒編舞家楊春光啦，大細路嘅林英傑啦，好氣量嘅賴恩慈，佢哋五位咧分別喺過往嘅兩年咧就去咗唔同嘅地方，譬如歐美啊、誒加拿大啊。

82
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:56,030
誒，甚至係去到日本啊、韓國嘅地方，都做唔同嘅考察嘅。咁考察個過程裏邊咧，佢哋去參觀一啲唔同嘅藝術節咧，去唔同嘅藝團嘅拜訪咧，甚至係同佢哋嗰啲藝術總監交流啦。咁個目標咧，就係希望通過佢哋嘅開闊視野，同埋佢哋嘅誒網絡嘅誒。

83
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:16,040
增進咧，可以將佢哋經驗咧帶翻嚟香港，同我哋西九同埋香港整體嘅藝術發展咧，可以有一個誒出出謀策略嘅一個誒方向噉樣嘅。噉我哋呢個計劃咧，除咗誒邀請咗佢哋五位出咗去海外組嘅考察之外咧，喺佢哋考察完咗咧，我哋亦都喺過往嘅。

84
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:36,050
一年咧安排咗兩次，同香港嘅業界嘅從業員一齊分享佢哋嘅經驗。咁亦都希望藉著呢一個噉嘅分享嘅時候咧，佢哋可以同業界咧再作一個更深嘅對話，將佢哋嘅經驗點樣可以引進到入嚟香港，而喺一個香港嘅本土嘅環境裏邊咧，可以發得發展得比較。

85
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,560
較誒順暢嘅。

86
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:59,150
咁另外一個環節咧，就係誒我哋一個嘅新作論壇嘅一個計劃嚟嘅。咁呢個新作論壇嘅計劃咧，特別咧係希望咧係製造一個平台咧，畀我哋本港嘅藝術家咧喺嗰個誒一個環境裏邊咧，可以開拓一啲新創意嘅思維嘅。咁喺過往咧，我哋。

87
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:19,160
誒一年裏邊咧，我哋都做咗三個唔同嘅新作論壇嘅工作坊。譬如咧，我哋舊年嘅六月就特別請咗誒兩位嚟自澳洲嘅藝術家，通過佢哋個議題咧，身體同埋點樣睇，佢哋同我哋一班嘅二十個嘅誒舞蹈同埋劇場嘅藝術家一齊喺五日嘅工作。

88
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:39,170
方裏邊咧，佢哋探索好多唔同嘅問題嘅，而點樣可以令到佢哋而家嘅創作咧更上一層樓。咁另外一個工作方咧就係叫社會針灸喺太平山區嘅社羣。咁呢個工作方咧特別針對咧就係一個社區藝術發展嘅一個誒工作方嚟嘅，因為其實香港亦都有好多唔同嘅社區藝術嘅發展嘅藝。

89
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:59,180
藝術家咧，佢特別有興趣係將啲藝術帶入社區嘅。噉佢通過誒一個藝術家Jaron Oldonow，佢喺嚟自加拿大，同我哋香港本土唔同嘅藝術家去傾下一啲新嘅方向。除咗我哋而家現在做緊嘅，仲有啲咩可行性咧？特別係青年拓展嗰方面嘅一啲藝術培訓嘅噉。

90
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:13,240
另外第三個誒工誒新創論壇嘅工作方咧，就係邀請咗一個西班牙好出名嘅一個團隊嘅藝術總監啦，誒Pat Castell，佢嚟咗咧就同香港特別探討係一個誒團隊。

91
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:33,530
從一個社區嘅發展，同一個唔係誒一般即係所謂叫科班出身嘅一個發展嘅一個藝團咧，而係特別通過佢哋嘅政治同埋社會嘅環境，而點樣去替造咗呢一個劇場由三十年嘅經驗而發展到一個嘅專業團隊。咁通過佢哋嘅經驗咧，同我哋香港藝術家咧，亦都係有一個好。

92
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:53,540
好嘅交流嘅平台嘅噉，每一個呢啲工作論誒新作論壇咧，我哋亦都會安排一啲公開嘅講座。咁喺過往誒，我哋亦都有差唔多三百多位嘅誒業界嘅人或者公眾人士咧，可以通過佢哋嘅參與，同我哋呢班嘅藝術家咧一齊再作一啲新嘅溝通。

93
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,080
咁除咗誒。

94
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:16,520
頭先我講嘅新作論壇工作坊之外咧，咁另外一個誒，我哋都好着重去發展嘅就係一個叫做製作人網絡會議同論壇啊，因為我相信咧喺整個表演藝術生態裏邊咧，除咗藝術家誒為咗藝術發展咧，一啲橋梁啊、製作人、策展人，甚至係藝術。

95
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:36,530
行政人員，佢哋嘅培訓都好緊要，而我哋將來五年後，我哋好多嘅劇場會起到嘅啦。咁亦都探討緊，而家成個亞洲區亦都有好多唔同嘅新嘅劇場會喺陸續呢未來嘅五年至十年會開拓啦。噉我哋就希望藉著呢一個叫做誒網製作網絡人嘅會議咧，邀請咗嚟。

96
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:56,540
嚟自特別係華語區誒嘅一啲製作人一齊嚟到香港咧，進行咗兩日嘅閉門會議，同一日嘅公開論壇。噉我哋亦都邀請到咧一啲世界各地嘅誒成功嘅製作人咧，同我哋一班噉嘅三十個人嘅團隊咧一齊去溝通一啲未來我哋究竟香港同埋亞洲區可以。

97
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:16,550
點樣從製作人嘅角度去一齊合作，一齊去探討一啲新嘅可行方案。噉我亦都公開誒做咗個公開論壇咧，喺亞洲協會做咗我哋嘅場地支持咧。咁喺個嗰個嗰日嘅誒公開論壇嗰度咧，大概有二百幾人嚟參加。噉我自己喺在場亦都見到咧，呢二百幾人咧，除咗業界嘅。

98
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:22,790
亦都有好多公眾嘅人士對我哋西九未來嘅發展係好有興趣嚟聽呢一個會議嘅。

99
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:45,260
咁繼續翻喺嗰個誒行政人員嗰方面咧，咁咧西九咧亦都從二零一一年開始咧，亦都係同誒香港嘅三會咧誒一齊做咗一啲唔同嘅誒文化領袖嘅論壇嘅。咁譬如過往嘅誒二零一一年開始，噉我哋一直去到今年咧都有支持佢哋每一年一度嘅論壇。

100
00:24:45,260 --> 00:25:05,270
啦，咁二零一四年咧，我哋特別咧就資助咗一個叫青年領袖平台嘅係列嘅。咁另外咧，二零一五年咧，啱啱過去咗嗰個誒誒論壇咧，我哋特別咧亦都邀請咗我哋好多嘅管理，我哋自己團隊嘅管理誒階層嘅誒同工咧，一齊喺呢個論壇裏邊做唔同嘅演講環節咧。

101
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,080
同埋同參與者去分享佢哋嘅想法同埋經驗嘅。

102
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:32,780
至於喺培育年輕藝術家嗰方面，西九嘅戲曲中心粵劇新星展咧，我相信係一個比較代誒具代表嘅一個project嚟嘅。噉我哋喺二零一四年咧，通過西九大戲棚嘅新星展演當中，我哋就挑選咗十二位咧比較優秀卓越嘅新星。

103
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:52,970
咁喺一四年去到一五年嘅期間咧，我哋亦都邀請咗羅家英先生作為呢一個計劃嘅策劃同埋指導。噉佢哋帶誒羅家英先生同呢十二位嘅新星咧一齊咧，就喺過往嘅一年裏邊，通過佢哋嘅長時期嘅排練訓練，就喺過往嘅二零。

104
00:25:52,970 --> 00:26:12,980
一五年二月去到三月期間，我哋一共做咗十場嘅新星展演嘅演出。咁呢十場裏邊咧，包括有佘太君掛帥同埋《慈郎舟》嘅唔同嘅摺子戲。咁除咗呢一個新星嗰個展演，畀到一班新星可以通過佢哋嘅培育同埋演出作一個培訓之外。

105
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:30,940
其實我哋呢個計劃裏邊咧，亦都係希望吸引咗一啲新嚟嘅觀眾嘅一啲唔同階層，唔一定係誒一啲睇開粵劇，因為可能佢哋對新星呢一個誒環節嘅誒藝術家咧有興趣，想知道佢哋發展緊或者佢哋嘅表演嘅情況係去到邊度嘅。

106
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:52,310
咁粵劇咧，我哋亦都好著重文化交流嗰方面嘅計劃，特別係喺我哋同百和會館咧，喺舊年四即係今年嘅四月咧，帶領咗一隊呢班新星同埋一班嘅誒參考嘅人員咧，一齊去咗杭州浙江小白花粵劇團。咁呢個係全女班嘅粵粵劇團。

107
00:26:52,310 --> 00:27:00,240
嘅，噉我哋一班香港嘅藝術家同浙江嘅小白花粵劇團，通過工作方，通過佢哋嘅一啲考察。

108
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:20,570
亦都通過咧藝術家畀佢哋嘅指導，帶咗佢哋好多唔同嘅新嘅信息。咁呢一種噉嘅誒文化交流咧，我哋喺未來兩未來嘅一兩年裏邊咧，都會繼續做嘅。譬如好似嚟緊嘅，我哋會去重慶市嘅誒川劇院啦，亦都會去台北嘅國光劇院嗰度繼續呢種嘅文。

109
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,390
化交流。

110
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:43,600
公開講座咧，除咗係戲劇同埋舞蹈嗰方面咧，我哋戲曲中心咧亦都有好多唔同嘅公開講座係列嘅。咁譬如舊年咧，誒我哋亦都同誒八和會館咧喺香港演藝學院嗰度咧做咗一個公開論壇，個主題叫做《城市需要戲曲嗎》。咁特別邀請咗汪明荃博士咧。

111
00:27:43,600 --> 00:28:03,610
同埋國內好知心嘅馬威圖女士咧，一齊做一個對談嘅噉，探討下究竟當今香港或者而家依家嘅香港嘅城市對戲曲粵劇其實係應該做點樣向前發展咧？咁呢個亦都係一個重點嘅一個公開講座。咁未來誒呢一年咧，我哋亦～

112
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,530
都會繼續會有其他嘅公開講座，繼續探討戲曲嘅發展。

113
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:29,170
至於喺人才培訓方面咧，我係同Amplus一樣啦。過往一年咧，我係推出咗我哋一個叫做Internship Program一個實習計劃嘅。咁喺表演藝術嗰方面咧嘅部門咧，我哋就一共咧就誒製造咗有九個實習生嘅機會啦。咁呢九個實實實習生咧，除咗係喺我哋嘅表演。

114
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:49,180
藝術部參加我哋嘅藝術誒artist team啦，或者藝術團隊嗰方面咧，其實佢哋亦都有其他嘅誒可以實習嘅方向嘅，譬如藝術行政啦、藝術舞台嘅管理啦，甚至係第時我哋做營運嘅我哋個部門，亦都有一啲實習生嘅誒，畀佢哋嘅誒實習嘅時間嘅。咁喺未來嘅一年。

115
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,400
咧，我哋亦都會繼續咧，會安排好多嘅唔同嘅實習生嘅機會。

116
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:14,830
至於同業界持份者嘅會議咧，咁呢個亦都係我哋嘅重點嘅一個目標嚟嘅。咁喺過往一年裏邊咧，我哋亦都做咗十次以上嘅大型嘅一個叫做tough嘅meeting啦。噉我哋有同唔同嘅舞蹈界咧、業界誒戲劇界咧、音樂界咧，甚至係戲曲界咧一齊交流意見。

117
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:34,840
咁呢啲大型嘅誒持份者嘅會議咧，我哋未來會繼續，尤其是喺我哋誒嚟緊嘅劇場嘅設計啊，同埋裏邊嘅營運方面，我哋會繼續同業界一直保持好密集嘅一個溝通嘅。咁但係除咗通過呢啲比較叫做正規嘅誒誒，我哋嘅持份者會議之外咧，其實我哋都搞緊。

118
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:54,850
喺唔同嘅持份者嘅meetings嘅，譬如喺過往啱啱星期一咧，舞蹈界咧亦都做咗一個比較casual啲，一個比較誒誒唔需要喺一個好侷限嘅環境裏邊咧，我我哋同咗有五十多位嘅舞蹈界嘅業界嘅人一齊去溝通啦。咁誒戲曲界亦都會繼續做啦，甚至八月咧，我哋嘅drama。

119
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:08,620
戲劇嗰邊咧，亦都會教緊一個比較現荒無啲嘅，亦都可以畀一啲年青啲嘅，或者甚至係平時喺一啲大型嘅持份者會議裏邊，佢哋未必會嚟嘅藝術家，係一個比較冇壓力之下，可以同我哋做一個繼續嘅對談嘅。

120
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:30,340
觀眾拓展，觀眾拓展咧，亦都係我哋表演藝術部嘅一個重點。噉我哋通過一啲大型嘅演出啦，甚至一啲嘅網上嘅平台咧，都做緊唔同嘅嘢嘅。譬如舉例咧，一個叫十年嘅計劃一期。咁呢一個咧係一個網上誒嘅平台嚟嘅。咁呢個誒，我哋喺

121
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:50,350
兩年前咧，我哋就同香港電影誒資料館咧一齊合辦。噉我哋揀咗十條嘅誒唔同嘅香港時年香港嘅歷史嘅片段咧，亦都邀請咗十位香港本地嘅誒編誒編曲家同埋作曲家音樂家一齊去為呢十條片咧去製作咗一個decade嘅。

122
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:59,230
誒網上平台嘅作品嘅，咁但係呢個作品咧嘅一個特點咧，就係可以咧畀觀眾係一個。

123
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:19,520
互動網上嗰度咧，佢自己亦都可以製作佢哋自己嘅daddy嘅一個誒作品噉樣。咁過運亦都已經有成幾萬個嘅誒參覽嘅參觀嘅人次㗎啦。咁另外至於誒同觀眾嘅直接嘅接觸咧，就我諗我哋嘅自由野就係一個代表作啦。噉。

124
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:39,530
喺舊年嘅十一月咧，一連兩日咧，我哋就喺我哋西九嘅公開嗰個誒地方啦，就舉辦咗一個自由嘢嘅誒户外嘅表演藝術嘅節節目。咁裏邊咧喺呢兩日裏邊嘅節目裏邊咧，我哋除咗有表演藝術咧，亦都邀請咗好多咧唔同嘅。

125
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:59,540
嘅藝術文化嘅團體咧，一齊同我哋合辦咗好多唔同嘅節目啊！咁呢個誒表呢個節目，除咗係一啲表演節目之外咧，我哋亦都譬如文學咧，我哋有請到文學館嘅人咧，同我哋一齊做一啲文學嘅誒工作坊啦、文學嘅表演啦，甚至我哋呢個市集咧，務求咧係一個誒。

126
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:17,600
open door一個公開嘅地方咧，可以帶動到多啲觀眾入嚟欣賞唔同嘅表演嘅節目。咁喺誒啱啱過去嗰時咧，我哋天氣好好，咁亦都製造咗個好好嘅平台，畀到有差不四萬幾五萬人嘅嚟咗我哋呢一個誒自由野嘅節目嗰度。

127
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,210
多謝。好，多謝大家。噉我而家咧就交翻啲時間畀我哋嘅，即係。

128
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,310
參與者咧，發表佢哋嘅意見啦，我哋。

129
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:44,390

132
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:25,470
咁咧，亦都請大家咧就留意到咧，立法會綜合大樓會議室出席會議或者公聽旁聽嘅公眾人士所需嘅須知咧，噉啊，所有嘅保安設施啦，同埋誒所有嘅交附在秘書處及發畀大家嘅函件咧，都放喺枱面㗎啦。咁在旁聽。

133
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,970
嘅公眾人士咧，亦可以在場。

134
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,860
誒再立場咧，立法會保安人員嘅嘅剷取有關嘅虧資。

135
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:45,800
咁咧就亦都再次提醒咧，誒，如果大家有咩意見書或者你哋嘅發言稿咧，你都可以畀我哋嘅工作人員嘅，即係你臨走嘅時候都可以，我哋傳翻一份嚇。

136
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,660
噉就而家開始，好唔好啊？

137
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,260
我哋首先請誒，Mr Despandy。

138
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,720
獅子山學會。

139
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,540
Mr. Dispandy, your terms. You have five minutes to.

140
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,350
Thank you.

141
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,060
Dear Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

142
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:13,720
我們 gathered here today to discuss the implement share our views on the implementation of the West Kaloon Cultural District project.

143
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,500
which was approved in January of 2013.

144
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,000
The new development aims to provide us with.

145
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,830
一 museum，一 Chinese opera theatre，一 music theatre， with a concert hall and 23 hectares of open space.

146
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,080
But now, here's the thing.

147
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,790
The critical question we need to ask ourselves is.

148
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,760
who will benefit from all of this and to what extent are we going to benefit from all of this?

149
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,330
The results of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Board were released yesterday.

150
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:53,460
with thousands of students getting accepted into universities in Hong Kong and other universities across the globe.

151
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,810
但係，what about the thousands of students who are unable to get into university?

152
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,180
因為 not achieving the required grades.

153
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,350
或 simply due to financial problems, financial poor financial situations.

154
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,500
Every year, there are around 25,000 students in Hong Kong.

155
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,590
Achieve the required grades to attend university.

156
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:22,160
然而，有隻有13,000個空間，喺本地大學，只有13,000。

157
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,540
provided by six universities in Hong Kong.

158
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,780
25,000 minus 13,000，that leaves us with 12,000。

159
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,220
what about them? What are they supposed to do?

160
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,100
now perhaps the only solution here is to.

161
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,330
嗯。

162
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,610
send these students abroad to study in universities outside of Hong Kong.

163
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,690
但係，what if the students are unable to afford the education abroad?

164
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,600
One such student, Mr Lau Kin Hang of Lasell College.

165
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,560
我收到H.K.D.S.E. grades yesterday.

166
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:06,980
turns out he was accepted into Cambridge University, one of the most prestigious and well-renowned universities here in the world.

167
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:16,180
however，Unfortunately，he will not be able to continue his pursue his career，educational career further，due to financial problems.

168
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,490
this is why the Line Rock Institute

169
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,350
suggest that the land on West Kowloon Cultural District be put on auction.

170
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,100
如果 allowed to be developed according to， the Kowloon Station plot ratio。

171
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,900
The Lion Rock Institute Research Department。

172
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,210
estimates a price of at least two hundred billion.

173
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:46,720
Now, West Kowloon District is a prime location with expert transport links and excellent infrastructure, excellent facilities.

174
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,300
The max plot ratio of 7.5 to one should should be easily accepted.

175
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,160
now this 200 billion would then be used.

176
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,390
sponsor these twelve thousand students.

177
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,020
That were otherwise unable to attend university here in Hong Kong.

178
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:11,610
We would essentially be creating six universities, six universities in a space of just forty hectares.

179
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:21,430
this is exactly why the Lion Rock Institute proposes that the land in West Kowloon Cultural District be sold on auction, rather than create a cultural quarters.

180
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,720
and twenty three hectares of open space, which may just benefit benefit very few.

181
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,690
It is crucial that we take the step to aiding the students.

182
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,580
the the very people that will make the future of Hong Kong, thank you.

183
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,050
O.K.下一位樑子琪先生。

184
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,890
多謝主席。

185
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,210
誒，我香港話劇團嘅樑子琪。

186
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:56,120
我今日誒想講遠啲誒，因為西九即將會有唔同嘅劇院落成。

187
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:06,440
咁點樣促進我哋專業嘅持份者去參與，令到呢個西九文化區能夠成功，係我哋最關心嘅地方。

188
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,620
香港話嘅團友以下嘅意見。

189
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:19,870
西九龍文化區嘅推行喺呢個時候係啱啱配合香港專業戲劇發展嘅提升嘅機遇，呢個係第一點。

190
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,370
西九文化區即將會有新嘅劇場落成，咁會有幾個？

191
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,010
呢個係誒戲劇界期望咗好多年嘅一個實際嘅進展。

192
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,700
就以香港嘅戲劇發展而言。

193
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,760
自從一九七七年香港話劇團作為第一個專業劇團成立到而家。

194
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:50,710
亦都係一九八八年香港戲劇學院第一屆戲劇學戲劇學院嘅畢業生，投入咗呢個業界裏邊。

195
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,150
香港嘅飛技人才先至開始陸續噉樣累積同埋成長。

196
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:06,470
透過業界嘅共同努力，令到呢二三十年間，香港呢個城市由以前我哋成日都會聽見人哋講嘅一個文化沙漠。

197
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,680
逐漸係而家係變成咗喺華語地區裏邊嘅一個戲劇重鎮。

198
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:29,890
特別係喺過億人口嘅珠三角粵語地區，香港相對於廣州同埋其他主要嘅城市，喺戲劇上邊嘅蓬勃發展同埋影響力，都係處於一個絕大嘅絕對嘅優勢同埋領先嘅位置。

199
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,110
呢個成功係取決於。

200
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,330
社會資源嘅投入。

201
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,070
戲劇人嘅整體嘅努力。

202
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,250
言論自由嘅優勢，同埋更多觀眾嘅參與同埋認同，缺一不可嘅。

203
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:51,500
如果一個城市係冇咗多姿多采嘅文化生活，佢唔能夠叫得做一個國際嘅大都會。

204
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,190
演藝文化喺呢一方面係擔當咗一個不可或缺嘅一環嘅。

205
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,340
香港嘅戲劇文化經歷咗上述咁多年嘅努力。

206
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,220
去到呢個階段，其實係。

207
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:23,510
啱啱開始成熟啦，因為我哋咁多年喺燕學院畢業嘅同學出咗嚟之後，佢哋經歷咗呢二十年嘅磨練，逐漸成長。而嗰個譬如嘅演員嘅層次，亦都有唔同嘅年紀嘅人演員，係可以令到我哋以製作上邊有更加豐富嘅。

208
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,030
一個層次。

209
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,920
朝住專業同埋一個普及嘅步伐，係健康發展緊嘅。

210
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:50,630
咁但係，外於喺目前，因為由康文署去管轄嘅所有演藝場地，佢哋嘅分配資呢個分配原則一個限制，佢哋一定需要有一個公平、一個誒誒多元化嘅一個分配嘅原則。

211
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:59,660
令到喺呢個階段，演藝文化唔能夠踏進下一百、下一階段更加好嘅發展。

212
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,660
西九文化區喺呢個時候出現。

213
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:08,930
如果佢能夠切中業界裏邊所需，我覺得係絕對可以成功嘅。

214
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:21,070
第二點，我哋係應該為將來嘅西九文化區嘅劇場嘅運作尋覓更加好嘅運作模式同埋合作模式。

215
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,930
追上國際嘅水平。

216
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:31,540
喺國際上，所有戲劇領先嘅城市，全部都係以院團合一嘅模式去運作嘅。

217
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,700
即係唔使講紐約、倫敦呢啲噉嘅國際城市，去到北京、上海。

218
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,130
甚至係廣州所有主要劇團，佢哋都有自己嘅劇場。

219
00:41:43,560 --> 00:42:01,770
尤其是以上海話嘅藝術中心，即係之前嘅上海人民劇院，佢哋喺十年前就建成咗佢哋嘅新嘅劇場大樓，啟用咗之後，佢哋整體嘅發展係令到整個業界相當之驚奇嘅。

220
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,350
佢嘅成績係有目共睹嘅。

221
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,760
香港要追上一個國際嘅。

222
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,600
當代嘅國際水平，除咗戲劇人嘅努力去作去創作更多藝術作品，同埋不斷追求突破之外，

223
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,510
佢個劇場嘅運作模式都要打破咁多年嘅侷限。

224
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:40,410
喺而家，但係喺而家香港劇場嘅措設施咁供不應求嘅情況底下，要進一步噉樣去發展去到理想，頭先我講嘅院團合一，即係有駐場劇院、完全駐場劇院嘅形形式係冇不可能嘅，即係大家都會知道呢個係一個不可能。

225
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,180
嘅現實。

226
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,630
但係西九龍如果仍然，

227
00:42:46,480 --> 00:43:06,490
我諗誒時間夠啦，因為你有嗰份誒即係書面嘅報表誒意見咧，我哋會參考你書面意見，好嘛？大家掌握下時間，下一位黃錦輝教授。好多謝主席。啊啊，以下啊係香港專業及資訊行政人員協會做西九文化人。

228
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:11,340
人才培養同埋促進持份者參與工作嘅諮詢下邊嘅意見。

229
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,010
專治會誒十分支持西九文化區嘅發展。

230
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:36,300
期望西九文化區管理局同同各持份者保持緊密嘅溝通同埋合作，尤其係為數不少嘅中小型藝術團體同埋啊藝術工作者啊，以便有效咁推動香港嘅文化及啊創意產業嘅發展。

231
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:56,610
為咗促進持份者嘅參與咧，啊，專資會建議西九文化區管理局啊，除咗利用網絡平台加強彙報及推廣之外咧，亦應該善用現有嘅啊政府嘅設施，包括康文署下嘅表演場地、博物館等等。

232
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:16,620
去發放一啲最新嘅資訊，同埋播放宣傳啊短片，加強宣傳啊西九文化區嘅核專主會亦都建議咧，喺蒐集啊及處理意見上咧，定立一啲機制。當接獲到啊啊，佢採納咗意見之後咧，應該用合理嘅時間內咧就回覆同。

233
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:36,630
同埋咧，應該進一步利用啊資訊及通訊技術，同不同嘅持份者咧，啊，包括海外藝術團體同埋啊其他人士嘅加強溝通，更加可以利用現時所啊現時啊先進嘅技術，例如大大數據咧去分析，瞭解一下各持份者嘅需要，進一

234
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:43,700
一步啊啊！完善服務，將香港嘅優點更加推廣到海外嘅啊！

235
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,180
啊！

236
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,390
專資會咧啊啊，亦都啊。

237
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,720
建議咧啊！

238
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:14,900
建議啊啊管理局咧，就有一個誒制定一個外借場地嘅啊安排嘅啊咁咧啊，應該咧提供一個清晰嘅指引啊。審議過程應該公平同埋透明，而且咧設有啊完善嘅上訴機制啊。若申請者，

239
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:32,570
申請唔到嘅時候咧，亦都可以提供到啊相關嘅原因嘅嚇。啊，另外咧啊，專小會亦都建議咧成立一啲啊資助嘅計劃，支持本地中小型藝術團體、新進藝術工作者嘅啊租租借場地嘅經費嘅嚇。

240
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:41,110
就喺教育方面咧，專資會咧支持啊啊西西九文化管理局加強同埋大大學合作啦。

241
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:54,550
喺培訓嘅領域方邊咧，啊，除咗培訓更多嘅啊藝術人才以外咧，亦都需要啊培訓更多嘅啊相關嘅行政管理人才，同埋有志創意嘅創業人士嘅合。

242
00:45:54,830 --> 00:46:12,130
同時間，專治會亦建議政府應該從小學開始加強文化啊藝術教育，讓更多人認識及學習欣賞文化藝術，提高文化素質，推動文化創意日產業普及化嘅發展。

243
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:32,750
專主會亦都支持啊，管理局咧繼續去邀請海內外藝術團體同埋人才來港交流，令本地嘅藝術界得以吸納海外嘅經驗，亦開拓本地啊藝團同埋人才到海外交流嘅發展嘅計劃嘅嚇。最後。

244
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:44,340
啊，香啊，專主會建議我哋香港應該多啲參考倫敦、紐約、啊悉尼、巴黎等地嘅推廣藝術文化嘅經驗。

245
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:54,280
參考嘅範疇可以包括文化藝術節目嘅策劃、支持本地藝團及新進藝術工作者發展嘅措施。

246
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:59,450
如何培訓及吸納熟悉文化藝術嘅行政管理人員？

247
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:19,740
如何挖掘藝術人才等，啊，從而從而制定適合香港自己嘅發展嘅方向。多謝主席。好啊，誒，請吳婉婷女士。好，多謝主席。誒，婉婷係灣仔區議會文化及康體事務委員會嘅主席，我亦都係文化力量嘅秘書長，亦都曾經係擔任。

248
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:39,750
苗中二文化館嘅顧問，咁因此咧，我誒今日嘅發言咧，主要我係想從一個點樣係喺社羣嘅層面嘅參與西九當中裏邊，去想提供一啲意見，因為喺誒唔同嘅社羣嘅文化創作工作裏邊咧，我哋都會睇到咧，係誒。

249
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:59,760
民間對於西九一個咁巨規模、咁專業嘅場地同埋團隊嘅渴慕咧，係一直都存在。咁但係喺我哋個誒整個面對誒西九嘅發展裏邊咧，我哋唔質疑係有關專業嘅提升、誒專業藝團嗰個發展嘅支援，亦都。

250
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:19,770
對於喺青年嘅誒誒青年嘅參與同埋培訓裏邊咧，我哋都睇到咧。其實今天係越嚟越係有更具規模、更有創意同埋更深入嘅誒工作。咁但係誒，我諗喺嗰個誒持份者嘅參與裏邊咧，我哋需要有更多。

251
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:39,780
嘅社羣視角，誒有好多分享，有講到有喺誒社交網絡嘅宣傳啦，誒係啲不同嘅地方嘅一啲展覽啊，都有一啲，譬如係即係剛才阿黃允輝教授講嘅一啲誒不同嘅誒同潛行者溝通或者宣傳嘅手法。

252
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:59,790
咁但係當中誒，大家有冇去認識到誒點樣去同不同社羣嘅結合？香港十八區每一區都有一啲地區嘅文化組織誒，居民組織亦都有區議會。咁喺呢啲誒組織裏邊咧，我哋其實有好多地區嘅誒文娛活動文。

253
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:19,800
文化活動咧係由一啲可能喺誒我哋專業嘅藝團嘅角度，並不是專業嘅人士喺文化活動有一直有一啲參與，但係呢一類型嘅文化工作者咧，我哋叫做或者叫社區工作者咧，佢哋能夠有機會走到去西九當中去建立。

254
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:39,810
嗰個誒觀眾羣係參與喺裏邊去誒去認識更多嘅專業，有佢哋嘅文化提升嘅機會咧，係重要嘅。呢個係對於西九建立佢佢嘅誒觀眾羣，同埋係同同不同社區結合係重要嘅。咁所以我好想喺誒未來嘅日子咧。

255
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:59,820
會見到西九喺呢一方面會有誒更多嘅投入同參與，誒無論喺任何嘅活動裏邊咧，都一定可以有社羣參與嘅部分嘅。例子就係我哋依家講緊誒新加入嘅一個實習生計劃啦，實習生喺完成佢實習之後，可唔可以嘗試？

256
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:19,830
去到唔同嘅社區去作佢哋嘅分享啦。誒西九除咗我哋要去建立觀眾羣以外，我哋都要去誒走出西九，係帶到去唔同嘅社區裏邊，例如有啲工作坊、有啲分享會，或者同地區嘅團體有一啲合作，係誒讓到喺誒地區。

257
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:39,840
裏邊嘅市民咧，佢哋會有一個機會係睇到誒社區文化營造可以有更多不同嘅面向，甚至乎我哋拉動到誒基層嘅市民咧，都願意走入去西九當中。因為我哋好多時講緊一啲參與街頭活動或者地區活動嘅朋友，佢哋可能唔敢行。

258
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:59,850
入去歌劇院嘅嚇，有啲人甚至乎面對empas咧，佢哋會覺得啊，嗰啲唔係我哋去嘅地方，因為嗰啲藝術品我唔識得欣賞。咁但係我哋能唔能夠去誒建立一個噉樣嘅誒啟動欣賞嘅一個方向咧？誒，我手上咧有一本係一啲我哋唔同嘅社區持份。

259
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:19,860
者朋友，佢哋喺十八區裏邊一齊去同誒藝術團體合作，推動一啲文化創意工作嘅故事嘅分享。呢本叫《發現香港》嘅書籍稍後時間咧，我哋亦都會文化力量都會將呢本書送到去誒西九管理局。噉我哋好希望咧，呢啲嘅故事係可以讓到我。

260
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:39,870
我哋喺往後喺志奮者參與裏邊加強到社羣視覺，讓到地區嘅朋友係籍住誒西九呢個地方嘅發展咧，能夠去加強我哋喺地區嘅文化參與、文化提升、營造社區。多謝主席。好啊，誒，我哋請翻啊。

261
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:59,880
第二座位阿梁永敏先，小姐好嘛？係唔該主席誒，咁首先講聲唔好意思先，今日誒，因為處理一啲有關源分分鐘時間嘅啊，sorry唔該，係啦，有關誒源水爭議一啲urgent嘅事項，咁所以遲咗噉啊，同咁多位講聲唔好意思先。咁誒，今日咧就代表公民黨咧，就即係講翻我哋對於誒即係。

262
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:19,890
今日議題嘅一啲建議，咁咧首先咧我就想誒，即係誒大家咧睇翻西九文化區管理局條例嘅一啲章節先，咁咧就包括咧係第十九同埋第二十條，咁當中咧就提到咧管理局咧係需要就關於發展或者營運藝術文化設施啦，相關設施同埋附。

263
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,340
熟設施嘅事宜咧。

264
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:41,800
等等咧，就係用一個適當嘅方式去諮詢公眾嘅。咁另外咧，第二十條咧亦都講到咧，管理局係需要一個設立一個諮詢會，收集咧公眾對於管理局職能事宜嘅一啲意見嚇。咁咧，當中亦都提及到咧，呢啲嘅會議咧係需要開放咧，係畀公眾人士去參。

265
00:52:41,800 --> 00:53:01,810
㗎咁咧，公民黨咧就誒，即係其實咧一路以嚟都非常之關注西九入邊嘅事項啦。咁誒，從誒條例草案由草擬開始咧，誒，我哋代表嘅議員咧亦都誒一路咧就不斷咁強調咧，做呢啲諮詢會嘅目的咧就唔係即係誒做下啲程序啊，令到誒呢個諮詢架構咧附。

266
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:21,820
合法例嘅要求，符合程序嘅要求咧，就算。又或者咧，係揾啲公關公司咧做下問卷啦，又或者做下啲公眾諮詢咧，就係了事。咁咧，呢個咧亦都唔係咧立法會當其時咧贊成呢條條例嘅時候咧嘅原來嘅意思嚟嘅。咁否則咧就會變咗畫虎不成啦，係反類犬呢個條例嘅目。

267
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:41,830
目的咧，其實係要由上而下，因時制宜，創造咧將西九創造成一個立足於香港、屬於香港人，但係咧又能夠咧係耀眼世界，令到咧西九喺文化版圖上面咧成為一個亮點。咁另外咧，佢嘅意思咧，亦都係要培養香港人嘅藝術素養啦，從而提升。

268
00:53:41,830 --> 00:54:01,840
人民質素，亦都咧係豐富藝術本位嘅香港文化藝術內涵。咁咧點樣去做到上述即係我所講嘅呢一啲嘅目的咧？咁誒，我都希望咧即係提提大家，即係之前咧立法會咧，亦都係曾經到訪過西班牙，當中咧係誒好重點咧就係睇過一個叫阿班。

269
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,620
多爾巴納計劃，咁當中咧就睇過佢嘅營運同埋管理嘅。

270
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:26,910
咁咧，當呢啲立法會議員咧去到睇嘅時候咧，就發覺當地咧係全部市民咧，幾乎咧都係有份參與呢個計劃嘅。咁決策層次咧，亦都係幾乎係人人有份，永不落空。咁當地嘅政府咧係容許各界咧係參與呢個文化計劃，令到計劃咧非常之成功。

271
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,800
每年咧係吸引到成一百二十萬嘅遊客去到到訪嘅。

272
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:51,090
咁之後咧，公民黨咧亦都曾經去誒到訪台中啦。咁當其時嘅市長胡志強先生咧，就同我哋嘅即係到訪嘅代表咧就話啦，喺二零零一年咧，台中市民咧每年參與文藝活動嘅次數咧係三點九二次。咁但係去到咧零九年嘅時候咧，已經大幅提升到去二十八點三八。

273
00:54:51,090 --> 00:55:06,580
次噉佢就話咧，台中市民咧就因此咧係變得更加有禮貌啦，市嘅衞生環境都改善咗啦，社會氣氛都更加和諧啦，連帶埋佢哋嘅工業產品咧都更加有創意嘅啊！咁相信咧，我哋香港咧亦都能做到。

274
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:22,550
噉啊，當誒世界各地嘅一啲國際都會一啲誒藝術文化中心咧，有一啲咁攝人嘅魅力嘅時候咧，咁誒我哋香港咧，其實都係好希望咧西九能夠成為其中之一。咁誒。

275
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:43,510
所以咧，要做到上述嘅目的咧，我哋就要透過我開場嘅時候所講嘅一個藝術諮詢架構咧，畀收有管理局開展咧，同本地同埋鄰近地區文化人同埋藝術家咧有一個深層次嘅文化藝術一個探索嘅對話，幫助我哋咧係一齊去定位同埋咧做好呢個策略。

276
00:55:43,510 --> 00:56:03,520
再用咧呢個藝術責任制咧，係將呢個策略咧係貫徹執行。咁要知道咧，倫敦嘅西區啦，又或者紐約嘅百老匯劇院咧，都唔係單憑咧長官意志咧就可以成就得到。如果我哋東施效貧嘅話咧，只會令到西九咧淪為好似康文處噉樣純粹租場嘅操作。咁咧係唯有咧。

277
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:23,530
用藝術策略加埋咧呢個藝術責任制咧，先至可以令到決責決策人咧係為決定去負責，確保咧喺西九上面嘅公堂咧係運用得宜，並且咧打到打造一個咧真正屬於香港人民嘅人民西九。咁最後咧，公民黨咧就建議嚇西九管理局咧係。

278
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:43,540
係參考咧，我剛才講過嘅外國經驗啦，令到咧香港嘅文化藝術界嘅持份者同埋市民咧都可以公開，甚至乎咧喺電視上面咧就住西九嘅發展咧係作出討論嚇，用佢哋嘅意見咧係作出碰撞。噉樣咧唔單止咧係達到我開場講嘅法律嘅要求啦，符合法例嘅。

279
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:54,530
權意啦，亦都更加咧，令到西九管理局咧或者政府喺面對社會爭議嘅問題嘅時候咧，係可以即係廣納民意。多謝主席意見啦嚇，多謝你。請陳家賢先生。

280
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:14,870
好多謝主席。咁香港自然藝術會咧，就一直希望西九能夠係人人共享嘅。咁無論喺呢個嘅係場地嘅硬件啦，又或者節目嘅軟件咧，就應該係用係通用嘅設計嘅核心嘅概念而係組成嘅。咁令到咧就係誒唔同嘅殘疾人士在內嘅係所有嘅人咧。

281
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:34,880
都可以能夠係參與其中嘅咁過去咧，香港自然藝術會咧就由二零一三年開始咧，就為到係西九嘅文化區裏邊嘅第一批嘅建築物，包括咗戲曲中心啦、Empas博物館啦、西九公園同埋自由空間等等咧。噉就提供一個嘅叫誒場地通達嘅設施嘅顧問嘅工作。噉我哋。

282
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:54,890
係透過一個嘅係誒場地通達嘅諮詢會議咧，就邀請唔同嘅復康界別嘅係即係團團體啦、組織嘅代表咧就係出席參與嘅，係聽取翻係用家嘅係實際嘅意見同埋佢哋嘅需要。咁而呢個嘅係通達嘅諮詢會議咧，亦都係成為咗西九同埋復康界嘅係一個。

283
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:14,900
嘅重要嘅橋梁，因為咧就係西九都可以聽得到啊，其實係唔同嘅復康嘅團體對於嗰個嘅通達設計嗰個嘅係嘅概念啦，同埋佢哋實際嘅需要嘅意見嘅。咁而過去咁多次嘅係即係我哋為咗唔同嘅建築物做咗咁多次嘅通達嘅諮詢會議嘅時候咧，我哋亦都會見得到啊，其實復康嘅

284
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:34,910
團體非常之踴躍去參與嘅，咁亦都反映到咧，佢哋係關注到係即係西九文化區裏邊嘅係配套嘅設施嘅。咁除此之外咧，我哋亦都係關注咧，就係誒外圍嘅環境嘅通達嘅程度嘅，係咪配合翻係西九文化區嗰個發展嘅？因此咧，我哋亦都希望咧，就係政府當局啦，或者區議會咧，亦都。

285
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:54,920
大頭營造翻係區外內、區內外嘅係通達嘅環境嘅，咁包括再係興建翻一啲嘅天橋啊、隧道啊，係連接翻係西九文化區，咁亦都係鼓勵翻唔同嘅持份者咧，去尤其是商業同埋其他服務嘅行業咧，具體噉樣落實翻係即係一個嘅通達嘅營運嘅概念嘅。咁喺咁多次。

286
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:14,930
嘅持份者嘅會議裏邊咧，亦都係有好多嘅係復康嘅朋友都係關注到咧，就係其實係節目通達嗰個嘅係重要性嘅。咁而香港智能藝術會咧，亦都係曾經係為到係西九嘅大戲棚啦、自由嘢等等咧，提供係一啲嘅係節目通達嘅服務。咁當中包括咗係一啲嘅係誒口述影像啊、劇場視形傳。

287
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:34,940
啊！簡易圖文版啊、通達字幕啊等等嘅係服務嘅噉，而亦都好多嘅殘疾嘅人士亦都反映翻畀我哋聽啦。啊，其實誒呢個服務係非常之好嘅，咁咧令到佢哋可以有機會去透過呢個服務去欣賞唔同嘅係藝術嘅節目嘅。噉我哋都希望咧，西教管理局咧就係亦都日後。

288
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:44,100
就繼續去提供呢個嘅節目通達嘅服務啦，咁讓到更多嘅殘障人士可以能夠係欣賞呢個嘅藝術嘅平等嘅機會嘅。

289
00:59:44,470 --> 01:00:04,480
咁至於培育人才嗰方面咧，其實咧而家係香港嘅本地嘅係節目咧，就係對於係通達嘅節目咧係未普及化嘅。咁尤其是藝術行政人員咧，對於係呢個嘅範疇嘅認知度係更加唔足夠嘅。噉我哋咧亦都建議咧就係誒需要透過有關嘅係培訓嘅工作啦，讓到藝術嘅行政人員咧。

290
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:24,490
能夠係認識到唔同範疇嘅節目嘅通達嘅服務嘅，又都係可以幫助得到咧。佢哋喺制定節目嘅時候咧，係加入翻係通達節目嘅元素嘅。噉我哋曾經亦都係同西九文化管理局去合辦咗行政人員嘅培訓嘅工作啦。咁邀請海外嘅劇場視形傳譯嘅專家，噉係為到係本地嘅。

291
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:44,500
劇場視聽傳譯員咧進行嘅培訓嘅工作，令到有關嘅係行政嘅人員去認識到嚇節目嘅通達嘅元素嘅。噉我哋亦都希望咧，就係其實咧就係西九嚟緊，亦都係需要係重視係員工嘅培訓嘅工作，亦都係成為係人力資源嘅策略嘅嘅其中一個部分嘅。咁至於對於藝術家嘅發展嘅。

292
01:00:44,500 --> 01:01:04,510
方面咧，咁其實咧，作為我哋作為係本港唯一一個全方位推動智能藝術嘅機構嘅時候咧，我哋亦都一直相信，其實係殘疾人士可以成為一個嘅創作者、藝術家。咁但係由於係香港而家嘅文化場地係非常之係缺乏嘅，好難揾到一個場地係做一個嘅展覽或者係表演嘅。噉我哋都想。

293
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:24,520
希望西九文化管理局咧可以繼續去推動係誒多元嘅文化全民嘅角度去推動係呢個嘅藝術嘅參與嘅。咁另外咧，我哋亦都喺促請翻係西九文化管理局咧，就係需要係盡快噉樣去規劃一套清晰嘅通達嘅政策咧，作為日後嘅營運嘅指引，貫徹噉樣落。

294
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:44,530
實呢個嘅具體嘅政策去協助係發展翻係場地嘅硬件啦，同埋係節目嘅軟件嗰個嘅通達嘅服務嘅。咁最後其實我哋亦都係擔心啊，西九而家面對緊個財政壓力嘅，當係開源節流嘅時候咧，會唔會覺得係啊？其實呢啲係一個小眾嘅服務，而係削減削減有關嘅資源咧？我哋期望住。

295
01:01:44,530 --> 01:02:00,580
其實咧，提供係通達嘅服務係一個係提供係全民有機會係參與藝術嘅一個嘅機會，係一個基本嘅人權嘅。咁而過去嗰啲嘅係服務咧，亦都得到係一般嘅係參加者嘅歡迎嘅。好啊，咁多謝主席。係請張珠宇博士。

296
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:23,590
啊，主席，大家各位，呃，早上好，我是天趣國際藝術傳播有限公司的負責人張珠宇，啊，非常榮幸有機會作為香港藝術，呃，視覺藝術工作者來分享我的一些觀點和建議，啊，西九文化區的建立對藝術工作者來講是極大的鼓舞，啊。

297
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:35,320
它將成為香港文化藝術地標的源地，呃，也是打造成亞洲藝術文化中心的聚家的平台。西九文化區得到各族的關切，存在的無限希望。

298
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,260
誒，empire。

299
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:57,550
博物館及一六年將成立的小型藝術展覽館的投入使用，都是我們極為關注的問題。特別是Empress的博物館落成，啊，對於視覺藝術在香港的發展意義重大。啊，這裏是否可以考慮增加本土藝術？嗯，經。

300
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:17,560
跟隨市藝文化輸出展示和收藏，是否足以代表本土市藝文化的最高水準？是否給予本地的香港本土藝術史進行梳理及對本土的畫廊藝術家們的培育和支持？這都是我們非常關注的一些。

301
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,590
問題，還有西九。

302
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:38,350
展覽館今後使用的機制應該是怎麼樣？是否有藝術團體、藝術家的資助機制？場館使用是否可以更加多元化、立體，使得香港民眾可以切身參與到項目中來？我們業界及藝術家們都相當期待。

303
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,430
哦。

304
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:59,720
然後呢，關於人才培育這方面，哈，我主要想談談是關於香港女性藝術家這裡的培育和研究的問題。我們天聚在二零幺幺年成立了國際女性藝術研究會和世界女藝術家分會，啊，這幾年我們參加了世界女藝術家總會，啊，它色彩空間第十。

305
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:19,730
第十一屆的國際大展活動，即一二年、一四年，我們分別參加了越南胡志明美術館及蒙古國的現代美術館大展。幺六年七月，我們將在台灣高雄啊展開第十二屆的大展。每次大展活動都聚集了兩百多位來自世界各地的優秀女性藝術家。

306
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:27,610
的創作，美嗯總會也曾經想過在香港舉辦五百位女性藝術家的大展和高分論壇。

307
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:35,540
像這麼大的具有意義的活動，可以想象，如果在香港，我們能夠，呃，談何容易呢？

308
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,650
這也正是我們期待需求的重要部分。

309
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:40,990
縱觀香港目前。

310
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:56,000
藝術市場被關注的女藝術家們寥寥無幾，藝術成就和商業價值遠不及日本的草間彌生及中國當代著名的女藝術家們，但是在香港其實有一大批。

311
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:02,360
默默耕耘中的女藝術家們，她們堅持精神非常難能可貴。

312
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:13,040
據統計，香港的女性超過百分五十，在香港的大專院校藝術係的就讀學生和畢業生，大部分也是女性。

313
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,310
這是一股不可忽視的藝術力量。

314
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:28,880
女性的天生細膩、專注、堅持，對真善美的追求，都是女性的創作優勢。只是女性所擔當的揹負，他們更多的責任和使命。

315
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:37,640
呃，歷來政府和社會對女性的藝術也少於重視和推動，令許多女性無法堅持，甚至放棄。

316
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:45,310
一個家庭是否温馨，社會是否和諧，與女主人翁的文化修養是分不開的。

317
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:57,900
在經濟高度發展、節奏高度緊張的社香港，存在的許多問題婦女，從而也產生了許多問題家庭，再者可能就會產生。

318
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,110
問題，社會。

319
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,950
這些都是亟待關注和解決的現象。

320
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:10,480
藝術陶冶性情，淨化心靈，它令人平和愉悦，可以體現提升女性的。

321
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:16,860
品味修養，所以我們希望政府希酒能夠在高度重視女性藝術的培育。

322
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:25,460
呃，教育等等，為女性創造更多更好的平台，來推動普及女性藝術的發展。

323
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:36,080
啊！呼籲更多的女性參與到文化藝術的行列中來，女性藝術對促進社會人文的持續發展也極具意義，不容忽視。

324
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:56,510
另外，為了提高香港的整體藝術水準，需要更多的與國際接軌，實行走出去，請進來。那也希望西九能夠牽頭，呃，組織更多的藝術家一團到其他地方考察學習，請進來，也希望能夠請到國際具有水平的藝術家。

325
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:04,690
專家學者們來香港交流研討，促進香港生態藝術生態的發展與學術的提升。

326
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:08,300
這些建議，好多謝你啊！嚇。

327
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,710
咁請黃建雲先生。

328
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:26,560
主席，誒各位議員、西九嘅同事，我係城市當代舞蹈團CDC舞蹈中心嘅總監黃建宏。以下僅代表城市當代舞蹈團、香港芭蕾舞團同埋香港舞蹈團就西九文化區嘅持份者參與而發言。

329
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:46,850
西九文化區嘅規劃同埋建設經過咁多年嘅討論，而家終於見到推進。隨住場館嘅設計工作如火如荼咁進行，我哋喺呢度再次提醒當局：香港需要嘅西九文化區唔係一個華而不實嘅建築，而係一個能夠全面提升香港文化。

330
01:07:46,850 --> 01:08:06,260
發展嘅建設同埋設施，所以佢必須同香港嘅文化藝術緊密結合，成為香港優秀藝術家嘅創作同埋發展基地。我哋認為西九文化區應該以香港九大藝團為首嘅本地專業演藝團體為重點嘅持份者出發。

331
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:19,920
當中九大藝團係由香港特區政府多年支持，經過數十年嘅耕耘往績，標示咗香港最高嘅文化嘅藝術水平，亦都係香港文化發展入邊最優秀嘅軟體。

332
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:34,500
西九文化區就係我哋香港文化發展入邊最重要嘅硬體，所以我哋要求喺設計呢啲硬件嘅時候，盡量配合客誒軟件嘅性能，而最終能夠讓軟件喺硬件入邊灌注生命。

333
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:54,790
彼此嘅功能可以相等逆彰，所以喺西九文化區嘅建設過程入邊咧，如果冇咗重要持份者，包括咗香港九大藝團嘅積極參與，就係一個人才同埋資源嘅大浪費。我哋認為嘅參與並非當局或者一般社會人士所認為嘅所理解。

334
01:08:54,790 --> 01:09:03,160
嘅業主同租客，或者場地同使用者之間嘅關係，而係一個共同合作、共同營運嘅夥伴關係。

335
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:23,850
畀藝團嚟到西九安家落户，鼓勵佢哋喺呢個能夠切合實際運作嘅地方提供創作同埋製製作高水平嘅節目，塑造呢個文化區嘅特色，等香港嘅市民對香港嘅誒藝術文化引以為傲，同時亦都令到海外訪客留下深刻嘅印象。

336
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:32,870
對於誒九大旗男藝團入邊嘅三個專業舞蹈團體嚟講，自然我哋係非常願意成為西九文化區嘅重要持份者夥伴。

337
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:53,160
並且喺合適嘅條件之下，同西九建立長遠嘅夥伴關係，以西九為家。我哋一個理想嘅家，正如我哋以之前同西九嘅會議所提及，應該包括兩大部分。第一部分係一個香港專業舞蹈中心，就係舞團日常工作同埋排練嘅地方，包括咗。

338
01:09:53,160 --> 01:10:13,170
排練室、辦公室、服裝間、儲存庫等，除咗由三個舞專業舞團合作營運之外，仲可以同香港嘅舞蹈界一齊享用當中嘅資源，舉辦各種各樣面向公眾嘅同埋推廣舞蹈嘅活動同訓練班，包括咗公開彩排、示範講座，設立全港嘅舞蹈。

339
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:25,690
資料庫同埋舉辦公開嘅舞蹈大師班等等，我哋相信憑住三大舞團嘅專業嘅經驗同埋資源分享，可以帶領香港嘅舞蹈界朝向更高嘅階梯進發。

340
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:45,980
第二部分，我哋係講緊一個專為舞蹈表演而度身訂造嘅香港舞蹈劇院。我哋知道西九已經預留咗場地，係做一個專屬舞蹈演出嘅劇院。我哋強烈要求呢個舞蹈劇院，從外部建築嘅設計到內部嘅環境設施，都必須能夠體現香港舞蹈嘅。

341
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,670
重要性同埋多元性。

342
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,710
而唔係香港而家眾多嘅多功能劇場。

343
01:10:51,990 --> 01:11:12,000
多功能嘅意思就係每樣嘢都有一啲，但係就冇一樣嘢能夠達到最崇高、最專業嘅水標準。如果西九文化區嘅目誒嘅目標同三個專業舞團係一樣嘅，希望將香港嘅舞蹈藝術更加提升嘅，咁千祈唔好再浪費金錢去建一個平庸、毫無特。

344
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,790
特色嘅多功能劇場。

345
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:34,080
香港三個最重要嘅舞團——城市當代舞蹈團、香港芭蕾舞團同埋香港舞蹈團嘅共同努力，並喺西九文化區管理嘅管理局嘅通力合作之下，我哋有信心可以喺未來嘅香港專業舞蹈中心同埋香港舞蹈劇院入邊製作，令香港引以為傲嘅舞蹈作品。多謝各位。

346
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:54,090
好，多謝你，請李庭川先生。係誒，主席好唔該誒，噉係誒香港音樂街文化發展協會嘅理事啦，叫李庭川啦。咁喺過去誒呢個十二年裏邊咧，我哋係做呢個街頭表演咧，已經係推動咗無數嘅表演啦。咁

347
01:11:54,090 --> 01:12:14,100
咁誒，我哋係一個誒一個非牟利嘅組織。我哋一路咧，即係推動緊香港嘅原創誒藝術發展啦。噉就誒，我哋相信同而家暫時啊好流行嘅年青人嘅誒喺街頭自己誒走出嚟表演嗰種形式係有分別嘅，因為佢哋好多都係唱一。

348
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:34,110
一啲誒人哋嘅歌啊，誒博取掌聲啊，咁噉就誒嗰啲屬於叫做賣藝啊。噉我哋係做緊嘅唔係嗰類嘅形式嘅。我哋一路咧都係誒公開接受報名啦，係一啲年青人啦。誒，其實我哋冇年齡限制嘅，不過年青人為主。噉佢哋會係誒。

349
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:52,710
有好多佢哋自己嘅創作，啊一路噉樣去誒表演啦。噉我其中比較特別嘅係一位誒叫做九保山永生，佢自己誒佢廿幾歲啊，揸住係百幾首歌，佢唔會賣嘅。佢話有一日如果有人

350
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,520
幫佢出唱片，嗰個一定係一個好有心嘅人。

351
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:04,210
咁呢啲係比較令人感動嘅一啲誒藝術創作者，正正呢啲人咧，佢哋係冇機會。

352
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,430
冇機會去發揮，冇一個場地。

353
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,680
嚇咁誒，佢哋亦都唔會話專登去誒。

354
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,740
誒走出街去，誒打開個盒去收錢。

355
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:22,120
咁呢個係我哋比較誒想推動多啲呢類嘅原創嘅創作者嘅。

356
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:40,480
噉啊，但係咧係最近誒有一個誒，我哋收到一個資訊就係可能西九嘅誒個公園嗰度咧會做一個誒發牌嘅制度啦，一個誒表演牌。咁呢個對我哋嚟講，我哋覺得係有少少誒。

357
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,100
覺得。

358
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:49,150
有啲怪嘅，誒通常一般啦，商場揾表演者，佢哋會畀錢表演者。

359
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:59,140
有調翻轉頭咧，如果係一啲誒，只係為咗收錢賣藝嘅，可能你發牌畀佢，OK，我哋覺得唔出奇嘅，因為佢哋喺嗰度得到利益。

360
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:14,860
但係一啲香港本身真係原創本土原創嘅，誒自己有歌，點解我去分享我嘅創作要畀錢你？我要畀錢攞個牌先至可以喺嗰個地方去表演，依個係一個好奇怪嘅事。

361
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:19,310
啊！咁呢個係我哋，亦都係非常之誒，覺得。

362
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:20,640
啊！

363
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:41,190
即係匪夷所思嘅。咁呢個我相信需要誒，你去考慮下。如果係做呢個發牌嘅制度，需唔需要留翻一啲空間去畀我哋呢類誒，即係呢類純粹係搞原創藝術，譬如誒而家目的都係誒培育呢個藝術創作者，或者係一啲誒。

364
01:14:41,650 --> 01:15:01,660
即係創作文化啦，咁而家我哋就係覺得誒會唔會忽略咗我哋呢類嘅團體咧？譬如我哋依類團體，我哋係公開報名，我哋製造一個平台，我哋本身全部都係義工，但係咧係發覺誒好似好忽略咗我哋呢類嘅團體喎。咁到時可能到最後啊誒我哋。

365
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:07,470
呢類嘅團體就會消失嘅啦，因為根本都冇地方畀我哋去做呢啲工作。

366
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:19,640
亦都抹殺咗好多誒一啲係有藝術創作嘅誒呢個，我哋覺得佢哋係藝術家咯嚇。咁呢個我係需要誒。

367
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:39,930
嚟管理當局去考慮下呢啲問題嘅，誒，我哋亦都唔希望到時入到一個叫做誒音樂街嘅地方，但係竟然係一街都係卡拉OK，個個都喺度唱緊一啲流行歌，流行歌多掌聲啊！但係喺推動藝術文化嘅創作上邊完全冇意義，噉。

368
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:44,580
呢個我好需要大家去諗清楚嘅。今日要講嘅係咁多啦。

369
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,800
好啊！請阿林明江先生。

370
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:48,950
誒。

371
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:54,340
朱子先生，好高興我今日有時間，誒有機會參加呢個會。

372
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:00,820
噉啊！我本身係一個藝術家，我從事咗。

373
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:05,410
文化同埋藝術創作超過四十年。

374
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:16,340
噉樣咧，我對西九嘅發展咧都提供咗好多意見，有啲係報紙上面，有啲係雜誌文章上面，但今日咧。

375
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:19,050
我都想講一句。

376
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,880
經典同埋精英文化嘅教育。

377
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:30,280
誒，我覺得一個民族、一個地區、一個國家要出大藝術家、大文學。

378
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:44,570
呢個國家、呢個地區、呢個民族係受人尊重嘅，因為只要文化同埋藝術係穿越歷史嘅，係值得人心普度眾生啊！一本聖經。

379
01:16:44,850 --> 01:17:00,580
一本《詩經》，咁一一本《論語》，一本《坦吉歌德》，一張《蒙娜麗莎》，啊，一一幅《清明上河圖》可以流傳千古，百睇不厭。呢個就係文化藝術嘅魅力。

380
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,860
噉啊！我覺得香港文化政策係。

381
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:15,900
比較放任㗎，噉啊有好多迷失㗎，係有啲錯位錯位㗎。我哋而家咧見到文化藝術嘅核心價值喺邊度？

382
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:36,360
啊！我覺得我依家睇到嘅嘢好多係畀價值觀啊，好亂㗎。有啲係在我自己嘅身份認識都唔清楚。噉啊，我啲表面上睇到嘅文化係咩文化咧？平面化、庸俗化，或者係一個流行文化，或者一個消。

383
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,580
廢文化。

384
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:59,860
特別係西九收藏咗一點八用香港納税人錢收藏咗一點八億西九裏嘅作品。噉啊，點解到而家我哋都睇唔到佢收藏係乜嘢？百分九十五嘅香港九十九香港藝術家文化工作者都睇唔到佢啲。

385
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,980
最好嘅作品究竟係咩嘢？點解唔展出畀我哋睇？

386
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:12,040
啊！我啲頭先到，我好同意嗰個黃大雄先生講，我啲香港人。

387
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:16,020
香港藝術館，啊M plus。

388
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:21,810
點解咧？展示我哋香港最高文化水平！

389
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:28,350
係體現我哋香港人、中國人嘅一個精神價值嘅地方。

390
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:34,280
嚇！體現我哋香港人、中國人審美嘅精神性。

391
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,010
而家喺邊度呢？

392
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:49,570
噉啊，再睇下舊年嘅某一份國議員，今日佢就冇冇嚟。噉啊，佢話收藏同我哋而家同。

393
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:59,740
香港政府收藏嗰啲本土藝術家嘅作品，二零一零年到二零一三年、一四年、一五年。

394
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:08,880
平均二零一零到二零一三平均係價值係四千蚊，三千九百九十一蚊。

395
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,650
今日二零一五年咧，平均係四點五萬。

396
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:21,790
噉樣咧，你賣一個日本人嘅作品係一千五百萬，運輸費一百萬美金。

397
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:32,420
如果喺噉樣情形下面，我哋香港藝術家幾時先至有機會達到呢個國際嘅水平？幾時可以成為一個正正色色？

398
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:37,810
一個大藝術家嘅應該達到嘅價值同埋佢地位咧。

399
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:45,330
你嘅而家呢？用金錢去包裝藝術品，唔係用藝術品本身去感染我哋。

400
01:19:49,440 --> 01:20:03,550
係好多人講林文江啊！你講少啲嘢啊，得罪人啊，得罪香港政府啊，誒，得罪收藏家，得罪西教啊。但係我作為一個有良知嘅藝術家，我覺得我應該講出我想講嘅嘢。

401
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:23,530
嚇！你一張作品最緊要佢本身嘅價值喺度打動人。好似我頭先講過啦，《蒙娜麗莎》五百幾年點解而家我哋成日去睇佢？佢研究佢，因為佢啲作品係畀我哋感受好多嘢。

402
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,060
係咪感動咗我幾大人？

403
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,540
噉我覺得香港而家咧。

404
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:47,780
以前嘅從嚟唔講藝術，而家又個個又講藝術。但係藝術係乜嘢咧？審美係乜嘢咧？佢精神係乜嘢？價值低喺邊度咧？我哋好少有人講。香港到而家都冇一個美術學院。

405
01:20:48,200 --> 01:21:08,210
啊！到我一本好嘅雜誌，好多謝你啊！啊，阿羅啊，可以啊，我時間唔夠，好多謝你啊。如果有書面各位，如果有有書面嘅發言或者你嘅意見咧，都可以畀我哋嘅工作人員嘅，因為我哋嘅時間都好緊迫啦。我哋十一點半就要完結呢個會議，所以咧，我哋而家就請誒。

406
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:17,870
民政局啦，同埋西九分別發言嘅，咁但係因為時間關係咧，我諗每人都係五分鐘啦嚇。請民政局就冇代表發言先。

407
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:38,500
好啊，誒多謝主席。誒我諗關於誒西九，大家誒提出好多意見啦。我都好多謝各個團體咧，今日誒都抽時間嚟，即係都同我哋即係交流。希望我哋都好高興聽到你哋對於西九在未來發展有邊一啲地方，我哋係需要加強同埋注意。咁或者我就集中講翻即係政策局各方面啦。頭先咧，我。

408
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:58,510
聽到誒有誒獅子山學會啊啊，Mr.誒Despandy都有提過啊，有意見誒係關於話嗰個西九用地嗰度噉，我都想回應一下咧。其實誒即係西九整個發展計劃，即係我哋都經過一個好全面同埋都好長時間嘅公眾諮詢啦。我哋其實亦都聽到市民都係好期望即係整。

409
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:18,520
整個西九計劃都係可以落實，因為即係當我哋上次司長嚟匯報嘅時候，誒第三期我哋而家未有一個時間表。其實大家我哋都聽到有聲音，都希望可以係由一個方法探討到可以完成整一個計劃。咁所以呢一度我哋都係會繼續努力去落實整個西九發展嘅。咁誒，如果係啊啊誒誒。

410
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:38,530
師資生學會有關於即係學生嗰一啲嘅關注，我哋都可以反映翻畀其他相關嘅政策局。咁頭先亦都聽到有誒誒嚟嘅朋友都有講到話，關於整體即係人才培訓同埋交流嗰一方面咧。咁當然頭先誒西九嘅介紹，其實佢哋都有好多嘅活動，都係提供機會畀。

411
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:58,540
誒本地嘅藝術家去出去接觸誒海外或者係本地有一啲嘅培訓嘅計劃啦。噉我哋政府方面咧，其實亦都係有誒提供資源咧，就係畀誒透過藝發局啦，或者係康文署佢自己做誒節目嘅時候咧，亦都係希望有機會咧，都可以畀機會畀翻本地嘅藝術家都係可以參與誒演出。

412
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:18,600
等佢哋有多一啲咧係誒誒演出嘅機會，咁而我哋亦都係有一個嘅誒藝術發展基金咧，都係專係咧就係資助誒誒項目咧，就去海外嘅誒同海外嘅藝團咧，就係做進行交流同埋誒表演嘅，等佢真係可以一直接誒誒有交流同埋可以。

413
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:29,690
有誒增進自己嘅藝術水平嗰個機會。噉就一四一五年嘅年度嚟到講咧，其實我哋都係支持咗誒五十個嘅文化項目嘅。咁誒。

414
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:36,910
我見到頭先團體就比較多，都係關注西九內部發展，或者請管理局都可以回應一下，係嘛？

415
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:45,390
Thank you very much, members of the deputations.

416
01:23:45,670 --> 01:24:05,680
some interesting feedback for us. I guess the reflections I would make over four years of listening to the deputations, much more constructive in terms of engagement and indicating, I think, a change in the relationship between many of the organisations in Hong Kong, both.

417
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:19,750
cultural and otherwise, I think it's my practice to take issue with the Lion Rock Institute. Although this year I am very pleased to see that, if I would be interested to hear about their 200 billion dollar

418
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:40,040
estimate of the value of the land sale as against the twenty one point six billion that the government gave us in two thousand and eight. Clearly, I think that augurs well for in terms of going forward. But the idea of a plot ratio of seven point five to one will be entirely

419
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:51,580
unacceptable to the government and to the people of Hong Kong, and clearly that is one of the issues that underpins the development of the West Kowloon project in terms of.

420
01:24:51,860 --> 01:25:11,870
the I think we value the the professional and senior executive support in terms of where we are, and we see you know sort of strong issues there in accord with what we're trying to do to build robust organisations not just at West Kaloon but you know in our

421
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:31,880
Constituent organisations with strong local presence, and I assume that will be a good opportunity for people to look at the future of the staffing of our organisations and future organisations. I want to particularly commend the Arts with the Disabled Association.

422
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:51,890
They have played a really fundamental role. I have a conflict of interest in that I personally support them as an organisation, and I will go on supporting them as an organisation in terms of the role that they play. I think the disabled are not well looked after in terms of access to many facilities in Hong Kong, and we have.

423
01:25:51,890 --> 01:26:11,900
particularly gone out of our way to engage with the association to ensure that all of our venues and all of our public spaces are going to be aspiring towards absolute best practice in terms of how those venues work, and that engagement will be ongoing. We accept many of the the

424
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,040
issues that they have raised with us.

425
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:34,630
In regard to the Lam Man Kong and the Arts for Nature group, the transparency of the M Plus collection is there. Every the two and a half thousand pieces that have been bought from Hong Kong artists, that they are transparent. They will be.

426
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:54,640
Your part online of the going forward, clearly, you know that's a you know an important part of the development of the museum. And then you know it is our intention with the exhibitions we're mounting at the moment, the exhibitions we will be mounting over the coming years, to be able to.

427
01:26:54,640 --> 01:27:14,650
Make it as accessible as possible, both in terms of loans to institutions, exhibitions, like the like the ones that we have on at the moment, both here and outside. And clearly, you know, we see that as you know a responsibility to build both the support from the Hong Kong artists, but also.

428
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:34,660
to find it as a way of showcasing Hong Kong artists to the world. In regard to the street performers, we think that we've developed a very light touch in terms of how we can encourage as many of the buskers and street performers in Hong Kong to be part of West Kowloon. We've gone spent.

429
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:54,670
many months working with the groups and we see that as something that we'll start testing with the opening of the nursery park. I'm sure Mr Lee's constituency have very great opportunities to express their individual art, their individual creations. And in regard to,

430
01:27:54,670 --> 01:28:14,680
Our friend Ms. Ong, it's really important. I think for the future of this project, that we engage with the young people, we engage with the district councils, we use the mechanisms established within the existing set up to be able to expand our reach, to expand.

431
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:34,690
Our understanding. If West Kowloon doesn't work for the young people of West of Hong Kong, I don't think its prospects are very good. And so we have spent a lot of time, a lot of effort focused on that, and we will continue to do that going forward. I should also make mention of.

432
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:54,700
One of the submitted written papers from the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. I think it was important at the last meeting of the Ledgeco subcommittee that we build a music centre by 2025 or 2030, and that's very much our intention. Okay.誒有冇其他嘅補充咧？

433
01:28:55,160 --> 01:29:01,020
如果冇咧，我哋就誒畀議員咧，就同大家交流一下。O K， Miss。

434
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:23,250
If I can just address one or two comments. First of all, I think I'd really like to commend also arts with the disabled, and I think that it's not only about physical access, but actually about software access, so to say, and and intellectual access in a certain way. And I think this is something that we'll be working on.

435
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,540
continuously. I come from

436
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:37,420
Earlier projects where I've we've been very proud to win, where I've been working before, win awards for being accessible. Also beyond the physical, and I think this is really important.

437
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:45,050
also， I'd like to commend Dr. Ceci Chung， because I think that the issue about

438
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:50,850
gender equality is always important to remember and to drive.

439
01:29:51,130 --> 01:30:11,140
And as a part of of the M+ acquisition policy, we have a very strict rule that we always try to check ourselves that we don't become subjected to what shall we say structural discrimination, excluding people for things that they are not in control of, be it.

440
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,920
age。

441
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:28,300
be it disability, be it gender, be it ethnicity, actually that it's actually the quality of the works of art that should count, nothing else. and I think that's a very central and important thing to drive. so I really I really commend you for driving that part.

442
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:35,580
And finally, my friend, Mr Lam, Oil Painters Research Society, of course.

443
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:44,030
The question of art prices is always a reason for frustration, especially if you're an artist. I would say that.

444
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:55,490
And it's not something that a museum really can control either. It is unfortunately a market. I would love to see this—the value of art and its sort of long perspective.

445
01:30:55,770 --> 01:31:15,780
Divested from the market, but Hong Kong more than any place in the world is a free market, and and that gives us the prices we have. And I think it is changing also for Hong Kong artists. I would say, but they will still have some way to go. Of course, when you build a museum collection, you're sort of happy.

446
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:27,560
That you don't have to pay overprices, also. So I mean, it's I'm in a sort of double position. Oh, thank you. Oh，各位議員誒提問同埋表達意見。

447
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,860
誒。

448
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:34,850
而家我報咗名嘅陳婉嫺同埋毛孟靜，有冇其他同事係誒副主席同埋？

449
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:40,770
咁因為時間所限咧，我諗四分鐘連問連答，係嘛？好啊，多謝主席。

450
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:55,520
各位早晨，多謝大家今日嚟畀意見，我哋非常之好啊！咁咧就由於我哋得四分鐘啦，我就想我哋有個互動，因為我有啲問題都想透過我嘅問誒在座嘅朋友咧，都能夠幫幫手。

451
01:31:55,940 --> 01:32:15,950
我例如我睇到香港專業及資深行政人員協會咧，都提到有關你第七段有關，就話點樣能夠吸納住各方嘅經驗咧？而西九其實就喺政府投下咁多資源，佢亦都有個條件去係喺世界上揾好多我哋認為都需要嘅。不過我哋一直嘅批評議會批評就話。

452
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:35,960
到底啲經驗點能夠轉翻去我哋本地咧，或者本地經驗點樣能夠教到佢哋嗰度咧？呢方面我哋好欠缺嘅。噉我就想問，喺而家啊，當然按按照西九嘅嘅誒啲朋友講咧，佢哋話佢哋有做到嘅。咁但係我哋總嘅嚟講就覺得，即係喺啲過程當中點樣？

453
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:55,050
令本地經驗同外國經驗，你互相個人當中有個交流嘅過，令到我哋能夠因此能夠有所提升咧。我都想聽聽，即係啊，黃錦輝教授或者其他人嘅意見，好嘛？唔該。請阿黃教授簡單啲回應啊。黃教授第七段裡面講到嘅你。O.K.

454
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,690
去投喎呢個。

455
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:18,130
我答過，因為對面答嘅喎。唔係唔係，我意見咧就想，我想聽你意見。即係你哋本身就係一個誒實踐者嚟㗎嘛，你本身一個實踐者嚟嘅。而啲實踐者個人當中，從我哋角度睇咧，就覺得西九係做得好足，好唔足夠嘅，好有偏差嘅。請嘅人方面咧，我哋一直批評緊民政事務。

456
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:38,140
佢喺呢方面冇做好啲角色嘅，噉啊，以致我哋有好多意見咧。咁呢個個去咗啲意見啦，噉就想問，即係你哋喺呢方面係咪好似我哋咁睇法咧？還是覺得喺呢方面你哋有另一啲睇法咧？所以我就希望即係聽下啲意見啦。係多謝完啊啊！我頭先睇過啊啊。

457
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:58,150
噉你嗰個度頭先做嗰個presentation咧，就響形式上咧係的確係有做到啲嘢兩地溝通嘅啊。不過我諗啊，呢個問題應該係有關嗰個transpet係咪有個較透明度嘅問題？好似觀眾即係好似我哋一般嘅市民，亦都睇唔到實際上有冇啲，比如硬性少少嘅指標啊、成效指標。

458
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:04,010
都可以畀我哋知道啊！究竟嗰個成效有幾多？我諗係欠缺咗一啲一部分啦。

459
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,690
誒。

460
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:25,980
呢點我諗，即係當然，我我唔想阿連生，唔好意思啊，相對就好似我我又太熟悉你哋啦。噉我咧就覺得唔好由佢答啦。即係我嘅觀點就認為，如果從佢哋角度講咧，佢認為佢自己做足夠足夠嘅。但係如果從我哋嘅角度睇咧，我哋覺得佢實有多嘢，例如喺個。

461
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:45,990
成個行政管理上，如果我哋將啲技術能夠大家互相交流嘅，就唔光係有啲外國請翻嚟嘅人啦，仲牽涉到本地人都應該一齊參與。即係建立西九過程當中，我認為唔光係有外邊經驗，本地都有個豐富經驗，而兩者之間點樣能夠互相去透過咁合作咧，係可以有提升我哋心。

462
01:34:45,990 --> 01:35:06,000
嘅，但往往呢方面咧就做得好曳，咁呢方面係我觀點啦，我唔否定阿連生，唔使緊張啊，我唔否定佢做咗一啲佢哋有呢方面嘅工作嘅，但同我哋一直提嘅意見咧係好唔同，咁所以咧我一直就批評緊係民政局嗰邊，係民政局你本身大老闆嚟㗎嘛，你畀

463
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:16,750
錢㗎嘛，你有份監察成個嘅聘任嗰個嘅過程，但係好多時往往政府早期咧，以致到而家都仲好放任啦。噉我唔知你哋嘅睇法係咪同我哋一樣？

464
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:20,490
或者其他朋友都可以講下嘅。

465
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:26,870
哦，如果要講舉手得啦，但係時間所限，哦，簡單啲。

466
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:27,840
就係。

467
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:48,130
本土人專業人士咧，誒，完全都冇機會入到西九管理層。噉啊，好多時講個我睇過個committee嗰啲嗰啲委員人，基本上都係行為嘅人，佢係有身份、有錢、有名，但係對藝術文化可以講一無所知。

468
01:35:48,130 --> 01:36:08,140
我希望咧呢啲責任唔係佢哋身上，係我哋香港人身上，係你我哋香港政府人嘅身上。我啲好同意你個觀點，應該將本土精英同埋嗰個外國嚟嘅專家一齊搞搞好佢，嚇咁喺香港西九。

469
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:28,150
有先至有希望，因為我哋係土生土長嘅香港人、中國人，只有我哋熟悉我哋文化，只有我哋知道我哋想追求乜嘢、做乜嘢。而家你盲目去跟西方，絕對唔係有出路嘅，因為西方文化已經好多人都係粉絲緊啦，特。

470
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:48,160
嘅係藝術，嚇係藝術文化類，啊都係反思近代一百年嚟嘅嘢。噉啊點解我哋香港都係個好優勢嘅中西文化交融，好多人受過西方教育，對西方好長時間㗎。噉啊對西方都好有了解，噉啊對東方自己都好有。點解我哋唔？

471
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:53,980
用我啲本土人才咩？噉樣有更更高嘅錢去平衡。

472
01:36:54,270 --> 01:37:14,280
誒嗰個錢仲多過我哋嘅特首，好嘛？阿阿阿林教授，O.K.，我哋我哋中止到先啦，好嘛？第二輪，好嘛？你嗰度冇慢靜，我哋掌握時間啦。誒，regarding the concerns expressed by Mr. Lee Ting Chun of the music

473
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,530
Street culture group.

474
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:36,950
Mr. Lee was essentially calling on your opening up further, if possible, the performing area in the park to make it more fluid, to make it more spontaneous. Say to allow more sort of street performance.

475
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:40,080
Not very well-known artists.

476
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:44,510
And he's particularly concerned that.

477
01:37:45,520 --> 01:38:00,200
artists of the type might just be screened out in the application process, but Mr. Lynch, in reply, you merely said, well, we will encourage as many.

478
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:10,630
artists in Hong Kong as possible, and everyone's got great opportunities. You haven't really replied to his concerns.

479
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,110
Thank you.

480
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:33,120
I think we have we've outlined already the measures that we're going to take and the very we expect you know as part of that process hundreds even you know of of Hong Kong street performers and buskers, you know we that inform we've given the undertaking to this committee even after I.

481
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:53,130
I'm gone. That we will be going through those issues with the committee to explain how we've outlined how it's going to operate. And I give you my absolute undertaking on my last day here that I'm sure the street performers are going to play a really fundamental part on the twenty-three hectare.

482
01:38:53,130 --> 01:39:13,140
Of open space that the Lion Rock Institute would like us to sell off, it clearly is going to be a major focus for street performer activity for many years to come. But would you actually consider opening up one section of that performance area? We're opening up the whole.

483
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:33,150
In designated areas, clearly, I haven't finished, Mr. Lynch. What I mean is what Mr. Lee was saying: opening up one section without applications, a street performer could just come in to make that performing scenario much more.

484
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:53,160
More spontaneous, much more fluid. In that sense, they don't need to apply, so that they wouldn't run the risk of being screened out at all. Well, no, we want freedom of access to, alongside freedom of speech, are fundamental principles underpinning what we're doing with West Galoon. So.

485
01:39:53,160 --> 01:40:13,170
所以任何 performer 可以來到現場自己唱。在任何一個點上，我猜問題是，我們想為觀眾找到使用這些空間，特別是公共空間，我們不會有五個薩克斯風手和五個風笛手站在彼此旁邊，試著淹沒。

486
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:33,180
Each other out. What we're doing is providing many opportunities all over the forty hectares to be able to give artists opportunities to do it in a way that works for them, but also works for the broader audience of Hong Kong. I think just watch this. You know, we'll be clearly.

487
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:53,190
Talking further to the subcommittee on this issue, but we are confident, and clearly my colleagues that will be now taking carriage of this issue into the future, we are very confident that it's going to be a valuable injection to the the nature of what goes on there, alongside the the work.

488
01:40:53,190 --> 01:41:01,350
from the major companies, the minor companies, and you know the you know the range of other things that we'll be you know undertaking on the site.

489
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:09,720
Perhaps that's enough for me. OK，好，下一位誒副主席。誒，多謝主席。主席喺誒。

490
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:30,140
誒，我諗今日首先多謝各位與會嘅朋友啦。噉就誒，要西九真係成功成為一個人民啊文化嘅民嘅西九咧，誒當然咧，我哋係要喺人才培育同埋咧促進持份者參與度做得好嘅。我誒聽咗。

491
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:42,480
我誒西九管理局嘅誒嗰個表述咧，同埋報告咧，我覺得大致上咧個方向係正確嘅，因為誒即係你要。

492
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:48,820
呢個人民西九可以成功，可以提升香港人嘅人民質素咧？

493
01:41:49,100 --> 01:42:09,110
誒藝術嘅素養咧，其實就你唔單止要有藝術家嘅啊，你要有誒技術藝術嘅行政人員啦，要有策展人啦，要有技術員啦，要有行誒呢個教育啊，配合令到將來咧係有人去誒享用嗰個西九啦噉。

494
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:15,130
咁即係呢啲咧？誒，我覺得都係個方向咧，係喺度。

495
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:25,820
足唔足夠我唔知，因為咧今日噉嘅報告咧係誒，即係冇一個詳細嘅誒分析個效果啊，即係達唔達到嗰個。

496
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:26,990
誒。

497
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,170
標準啊，噉樣啦。

498
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:49,490
噉我亦都見到，即係對於即係將西九擠翻喺國際文化藝術版圖上面，成為誒另一個亮點呢度咧，亦都係管理局方面咧係有即係就住誒香港誒，無論係藝術家呢個係其他嘅誒相關嘅。

499
01:42:49,490 --> 01:43:08,120
誒人員啦，譬如包括策展人啊、誒行政人員啊等等咧，都係有製造一啲交流嘅界面嘅。咁呢個都係誒，我覺得方向係正確。但係主席有有限嘅時間，我想問誒一個問題咧，就係。

500
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:28,480
即係頭先咁講咧，就從正面嚟到講啊，所有嘅嘢噉。但係咧，究竟喺人才培訓同埋促進持份者參與呢方面咧，西九管理局有冇遇到困難咧？呢啲困難係乜嘢咧？譬如話呢啲會唔會係啊？你叫教育局喺教育嘅政策或者喺

501
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:48,760
個課程啊，藝術文化嘅課程嘅嘅修訂度係碰壁咧，或者你會唔會話係啊藝術界嚇，即係譬如頭先聽到啦，呢個九大藝團其中三個啦，就喺度發表咗啦嚇，噉就譬如話主流、次流嘅。

502
01:43:48,760 --> 01:44:01,960
藝術啊，大眾、小眾藝術啊之間嗰個張力係咪你做呢個促進持份者參與嘅另一個誒阻力咧？會唔會係呢個所謂山頭主義係一個阻力咧？

503
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:10,340
誒，我想用剩翻嗰啲時間畀管理局，從呢個角度誒，同我哋誒講一講，係嘛？好嘛，你就分鐘簡短啲嘅發言。

504
01:44:11,670 --> 01:44:13,390
啊，Mr. Lim。

505
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:34,160
Well, that's a very hard last question from the deputy chairman. I guess our view is, I think over the last couple of years we have spent a lot of time talking to to individual groups, dealing with government, dealing with the Ledgeco, and clearly dealing with the outside.

506
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:54,170
And I think one of the things that underpins all of the initiatives that my colleagues have outlined today is the idea, which I think we would uphold quite strongly, that not all of the knowledge, not all of the expertise sits in Hong Kong, and from our point of.

507
01:44:54,170 --> 01:45:09,490
View the reason that Dr Nitfer and myself came to undertake these roles was to bring the expertise that we had individually and that members of our team had. But we recognised the importance of

508
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:29,780
Hong Kong being able to create leaders like Anna Chan and Louis Yu and members of the all of the teams. Now, 90% of our staff come from Hong Kong, and now clearly, I think killing that perception would be one of the important issues in establishing the credibility of the organisation.

509
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:49,790
as it moves to its next phase, clearly being able to work with the educational authorities, whether it be within the government, within the university and the school sector, is an important part of a different engagement with young people. Which I would hope is really going to change.

510
01:45:49,790 --> 01:46:09,800
perceptions going forward. Clearly, you know, on many other fronts, you know, we we take the view that West Kalim is for everyone. We we we have been talking to everyone. We don't see it as the province of the elites, whether they be the western or the eastern elites. And from that point of view, I would hope that.

511
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:29,810
The spirit that continues is of being able to share those views. You know, beyond my time and beyond, you know, the you know the next stage of the development of West Kalim.主席，誒，我我覺得咧就咁誒，嗰個問題的確咧係誒難答嘅。誒，但係咧我就唔想我哋。

512
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:49,820
呢個小組咧，淨係聽到喜訊，而係聽唔到一啲憂慮同埋困難，所以可唔可我請社會管理局喺今日會後咧，可唔可以用一個文件方式補充一下？可以，好嘛？好，誒，陳主席，多謝主席。啊，副主席講到嘅憂慮問題，我都今日想同大家討論一下。

513
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:56,700
因為當初我哋聽到有西九呢個世界級嘅文化區，當然係開心啦。但係發展到今日咧，

514
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:16,990
你問立法會咧，立法會就係憂心擔心多過開心。我唔知啲藝術團體到今時今日，你哋嘅感覺係點樣？尤其是係當個落成時間同埋成個西九文化區嘅規模都好多不確定嘅因素，究竟會唔會係壯士斷臂變咗縮水小西九？

515
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:19,420
定係幾時就會成個西九出現咧？

516
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:30,620
誒各位，尤其是一啲藝術團體，可以發表下，即係你哋對呢樣嘢有冇一個困擾或者憂慮咧？你哋同西九有冇喺呢方面嘅溝通咧？

517
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,990
係，邊個答？舉手，係阿梁志傑。

518
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,270
啊，簡短啲。

519
01:47:40,770 --> 01:48:00,780
講一講一講，係多謝主席，我係規劃議員嘅。咁誒，呢個憂慮同埋擔心當然係有啦。我哋由二零零二零三年開始，其實已經一路誒已經研窩，已經參與咗呢個西九嘅討論。當時好多呢個發展商要捉我哋上去開會啊噉。咁當然我哋知。

520
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:20,790
知道即係真正要為西九發展而努力嘅係我哋呢一啲噉嘅藝術團體，因為我哋係裏邊嘅軟件參與者，我哋做成點樣係直接令到呢個西九究竟將來會唔會成功係其中一個重要嘅因素。咁所以喺我哋方面，我哋覺得。

521
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:40,800
佢始終都會會成立嘅，而我哋係會盡我哋一切嘅努力，係去配合翻。究竟香港啊，而家已經發展到噉樣啦，我哋應該用一個乜嘢嘅方式係令到喺呢個情況底下，佢係會做到最好咧？誒，我我相信即係面對呢個財政壓力。

522
01:48:40,800 --> 01:49:00,810
係整個社會都要需要面對嘅，唔唔可以話藝術界就話啊！你一定要發展啊！你一定要去到咩規模啊！你一定要去到有有一個咩乜嘢嘅誒抌多幾多錢落去。我相信呢個社會會最後尾會有一個共識。但係當然我哋知道，我哋會支持文化嘅投入係非常重要嘅。佢對於

523
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:20,820
市民嘅人民質素，所有嘢都係相當重要，所以我哋會盡我哋嘅能力去做呢樣嘢咯。我想知你哋係又都期望定係觀望態度，即係嗱，佢一開你已經留咗最好嘅嘢咧，飛奔就入去演出，定係都係冇啦，觀望下先。文化中心有期咧，我就梗係將啲正嘢擺文化中心一個穩陣啊，噉樣你。

524
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:22,300
係咩心心境？

525
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,340
啊！城市當代舞蹈團嘅朋友，有少少啲先，係。

526
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:46,630
咁代表誒城市三道板嗰度，全C D C武道中心講，對我哋嚟講，其實同西九嘅係一個共同合作嘅關係，即係我哋唔係等佢起好，然後我哋諗我哋放啲咩入去喺而家嘅時候，我哋已經同西九有好多唔同嘅合作，好多唔同嘅活動發生緊，而我哋係。

527
01:49:46,630 --> 01:50:06,640
係好希望同佢一齊去營運，一齊去諗跟住路嘅路點樣行。即係我我唔希望即係西九同埋啲artist之間嘅關係就係只係等個場地起好，然後啲artist喺度諗下，我又唔入去，或者我要收到幾多錢入去。咁呢個誒唔係一個健康，亦都唔係一個全面嘅即係。

528
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:26,650
誒可以令到西九去發展嘅一個關係咯，黃生，但係頭先你嘅發言咧，我覺得你同西九都有個分歧喺度。嗯，譬如你想嗰個演藝劇場係即係舞蹈為舞蹈演藝劇場啦，咁當然西九個表面上都係咁講，但係佢喺譬如網度都話喺二零一九年落成喺其他場地落成之前咧，都會做話劇、歌劇、音。

529
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:46,660
樂劇嘅其他場地就未知幾時落成，即使呢個仍然都係一個綜合綜合嘅劇場嚟嘅喎。係，但係我哋希望佢嘅設施係可以做到專業嘅舞蹈嘅效果。當然誒，冇可能個台係一百個percent淨係做舞蹈，但係我哋喺規劃上邊係必須要投入呢個噉樣嘅方向。

530
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:55,320
O O K，因為個時間關係咧，噉我誒，如果大家唔反對咧，我就延長多十五分鐘。我諗冇人反對嘛。

531
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,390
咁跟住落嚟係易志明。

532
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:16,690
好啊！多謝主席。誒，因為頭先隔離開第二個會啦，所以遲咗翻過嚟。嗱，我諗誒多謝西九管理局今日上嚟介紹啦。我相信你哋喺過一段日子咧，做咗即係相當多嘅工作啊。咁呢個相對以前未有你哋西九管理局之前，我諗係有個距離嘅。噉我希望你哋循呢個方向繼續努力啦。

533
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:37,010
咁咧就誒頭先誒，首先啊，主席，我申報我係呢個香港話劇團嘅理事之一啊。咁咧就誒，我係支持頭先誒阿梁之傑先生所講嘅，即係日後嗰啲嘅誒誒表演場地咧，如果係能夠有一啲所謂駐場嘅誒團隊喺度咧，咁呢個係有一定嘅好處嘅啊。咁因為

534
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:57,020
如果佢嗰個演期可以較為長少少咧，噉佢嗰個成本咧就會下降，票價就可以放減低，咁咧就能夠吸引咧更多嘅市民咧去參與呢啲文化嘅誒藝術嘅表演嘅工作。嗱，我諗大家都會認同嘅咧，就係即係誒，我哋講緊點樣培養人才啊，噉。

535
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:11,760
你首先係咪應該喺自幼咧就培養佢哋對文化藝術嘅一啲興趣先咧？咁噉，但係咧呢個咧就似乎啊，主席啊，就牽涉到咧另外一個話題咧，就喺個教育制度上邊咧有冇去進行呢一方面嘅培訓工作咧？噉。

536
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:32,050
咁而家你睇到咧，就係誒，我哋喺呢個畫劇團咁多年工作咧，即係佢哋一路越做越好啦。不過咧，你睇到個觀眾羣嗰個嘅增長嘅速率咧，係非常之慢。咁即係話咧，睇開嘅人咧就繼續嚟啊，可能拉多幾個朋友咁咧，但係咧，你話係咪能夠普遍地咧將呢啲嘅？

537
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:39,130
各方面嘅藝術文化咧，係擴展到去呢個社會各個階層咧，我就暫時睇唔到呢個效果。

538
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:57,020
噉我就覺得咧，係咪應該喺誒檢討下我哋嘅教育制度啊？喺佢哋嗰個誒尤其是中學階段嗰嗰六年啦，嚇，即係係咪可以多啲涉獵咧？就唔係話畢咗業出嚟啦，等有朋友遛佢去睇戲啊，咁或者睇跳舞啦，咁先開始有個興趣咧噉。

539
01:52:57,490 --> 01:53:17,500
咁呢個誒，因為我自己誒，我我所服務嘅公司咧，我哋又有個所謂學校起動計劃啦。噉我哋係誒誒資助啲學校做一啲所謂閲讀計劃。噉我我都好留意佢哋嘅進展嘅。咁咧發覺咧，form one form two嘅同學咧參與啲閲讀計劃咧就比較多嘅熱心嘅，但係咧去到form three開始就。

540
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:37,510
job啊，好好勁㗎啦嚇，即係因為點解咧？我問阿校長，佢話：，一開始要去讀書啊，要準備考試嚇。咁咧，佢佢跟住落嚟嗰幾年咧，根本上就比較少涉獵嘅，除非佢係特特別有興趣喺某一方面。咁所以，我覺得呢個可能啊，主席你係咪應該即係帶入去唔知喺邊個平台咧，即係牽涉到教育局？

541
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:47,550
咧都要有啲喺課程上嘅檢討咧，即係嗰啲學生嘅壓力實在太大。嗱，仲仲有另一個問題咧，就係我哋希望有人才保留喺我哋嘅呢個演藝界咧。

542
01:53:47,830 --> 01:54:01,880
噉佢哋嗰個嘅，當然我哋睇到啲所謂天王巨星，佢嘅收入梗係非常之高啦嚇。咁但係如果你睇到一般嘅文化表演嘅藝術從業員咧，佢哋嘅薪級薪薪薪酬水平其實係低嘅，以我所理解。

543
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:22,170
咁而家我又睇到政府咧，過往即係喺呢個嘅畀呢一啲主要藝團嘅一啲資助啦。過去十幾年來咧，佢哋所嗰個增幅啊，係遠低於個通脹啊。啊，噉我睇到嗰啲，你又如何令到啲演藝人員能夠真係安心可以養妻活兒，又繼續喺個興趣方？

544
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:42,180
方面喺呢方面去繼續發展咧，咁咁呢個即係我覺得嗰個嗰個誒呢方面係咪應該要去即係政府方面，我哋去要向誒呢個民政事務局啦，就唔係西九管理局啦，去表達一下即係呢方面嘅關注咧噉啊。因為如果唔係嘅話，你呢個社會好現實嘅。如果我呢一個

545
01:54:42,180 --> 01:55:01,530
作為我一個職業，我又唔能夠養妻活兒嘅話，我點會投身落去繼續去去去發展或者接受你哋嘅培訓咧？係嘛？所以呢個我諗係多方面嘅問題咯。多謝主席。好啊，我純粹發表意見嘅啫。哦，噉啊，我哋第一輪就講完啦。噉啊，第二輪啊，陳婉琳，亦都係幾分鐘。好快。

546
01:55:01,810 --> 01:55:02,720
誒。

547
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,390
因為我仍然都講翻嗰個人才問題。

548
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:26,680
誒，當然我覺得，如果按照翻剛才即係西九你哋講嗰個成個人才嘅發展咧，我哋睇到你嘅框架樹嘅。而呢框架咧，我亦都唔想講話啱或者唔啱，因為如果你話講層次上咧，我覺得有啲地方我哋都有啲擔心。例如，我哋就指。

549
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:46,690
而家好多時嘅藝術工作者都誒提一個問題，就話香港嘅藝術行政人員呢方面嘅發展咧，就係缺乏嘅。本來成個西九發展過程當中係有機會喺呢方面係幫翻呢方面嘅手，但好可惜喺過程當中，你話你冇做又唔係，不過個數字係甚低甚低得好犀利，甚至有啲嘢係。

550
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:56,000
冇份參與嘅，咁所以我就想問，其實呢個問題我就都都唔係問西九，我就想問民政局啊，即係始終我認為民政局嘅站係最大嘅。

551
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:16,290
我哋睇到就話去到二零一六至一八，按照而家嘅城西九一啲嘅各個誒誒管落成嘅嘅時間嚟睇咧，到底嗰個時候我哋有冇足夠啲行政管理人才同中層管理咧？喺呢方面嘅嘅情況係如何咧？我上次曾經立法會問過啲問題嘅，咁當時仲係楊立。

552
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:25,950
門喺立法會做文政嘅時候咧，佢哋答到咧是好有噉樣，但係我自己感覺到咧就真係唔係噉樣啦。咁所以我就想問誒呢個文政。

553
01:56:26,230 --> 01:56:40,340
嗱，我哋好快呢啲案件逐步落成㗎啦，成套嘅藝術館人才同埋中層管理上，你準備幾多咧？到時係點樣咧？有冇呢個準備咧？主席唔該。好啊，民政局加緊。

554
01:56:41,320 --> 01:57:01,330
多謝主席，多謝陳議員嘅問題。其實我哋都好明白，即係隨住硬件嗰個落成，即係嗰個藝術行政人員嗰個需求都係會上升。咁所以其實喺誒一三一四年嘅時候，我哋都已經係專登額外有一個撥款咧，就起碼專才即係個款項係專係用喺培訓誒呢一個藝術行政人員嗰度嘅。咁嗰個方向咧。

555
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:21,340
就我哋希望喺嚟緊五年咧，就可以提供到六百個嘅培訓嘅誒名額啦。噉就係其中係包括係即係都係希望可以擴展。其實而家而家康文署咧同埋藝發局都係有一啲實習嘅誒誒就計劃喺度嘅。噉我哋希望有呢個額外嘅資源咧，佢哋可以再擴展呢個計劃，誒提供多啲嘅誒名額啦。咁亦都係可以有。

556
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:41,350
有一啲誒，再多啲嘅獎學金咧，就不論係喺本地嘅一啲嘅全日制嘅誒課程，或者係誒一啲海外嘅誒藝術學院嘅一啲課程咧，都可以提供到誒資助到一啲嘅誒誒藝術範疇嘅人士，就可以去修讀。咁都係希望可以就透過呢一啲嘅擴展嘅計劃咧，都係可以。

557
01:57:41,350 --> 01:58:01,360
培訓多啲嘅藝術行政人員噉，但係我都知。首先啊，陳議員，你都想理解啊，數據上我哋知唔知道？誒訓練咗之後，誒嗰個誒滿足率係點咧？咁呢一刻我就真係冇嗰個數字嘅，但係我哋都會即係密切留意住誒嗰一個情況係點。我哋睇下呢一個五年呢一個嘅。

558
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:21,370
資源我哋誒之後係咪需要誒有額外嘅處理，定係需唔需要再加強咯？主席啊，這些意見咧就唔係今日嘅，我哋由即係都幾耐嘅時間路都講，即係話誒你，因為我哋聽民間聲音就有一個幾強嘅意見，咁咧我就當然我冇否定而家政府你有做啲。

559
01:58:21,370 --> 01:58:41,380
夜包西管西九管理局有做啲嘢，我覺得問題就話你點樣能夠令到佢更加會可以喺未來係能夠即係理想啲咧？例如當中有個團體講到九大嘅，即係九大團體就話：喂，你成個西九發展過程當中，你哋係咪個同佢呢方面係有幾多嘅？

560
01:58:41,430 --> 01:59:01,440
嘅嘅嘅互通或者一啲嘅大家共同去去去起咧嗱呢個起我唔係講硬件，我係講軟件發展過程當中就係呢個畢竟都係政府一直資助九大政團，當裏邊可能有民間一啲唔同嘅睇法，不過畢竟就覺得呢個係香港存在本地嘅一個政府資助嘅團體，係更好能夠理。

561
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:10,170
喺西九發展過程當中，佢哋嘅參與都好重要。噉，我覺得唔知你哋有冇呢諗法啫？唔該，主席。好誒，冇嘅嘛。

562
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:30,900
誒誒，我如果有時間，我誒簡單講一講啦。係啦，其實誒，頭先啊，社交管理局都有講啦，亦我哋亦都好高興聽到，其實有出席嘅話劇團同埋即係當代舞蹈團嘅代表都有提到，其實大家而家都係有一個合作嘅基礎喺度，亦都係有即係誒誒誒有佢哋嘅參與，亦都係有誒不停嘅討論，即係其實嚟緊。

563
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:39,650
咁嗰個即係以舞蹈為主嗰個誒演藝廳，其實過程設計之中，我知知道佢哋都係有討論嘅。噉我哋都會繼續呢方面嘅工作。副主席。

564
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:56,020
誒，多謝主席容許我有第二次發言嘅機會啦。有第一次發言嘅時候咧，我已經對於今日誒西九文化區管理局交嚟我哋呢個小組委員會嘅報告咧係予以肯定嘅。不過一個問題咧就係咧誒，即係你。

565
01:59:56,340 --> 02:00:02,240
淨係講咗一面咧，我就覺得咧係唔係好夠啊！啊，因為咧。

566
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:22,530
誒，誒，我哋呢個誒，小小委員會咧，主席，當然你都明白咧，我哋有其中一個誒角色咧，就係憑住我哋發問嘅問題喺呢個公開嘅平台上邊，要求商有管理局係提出佢哋嘅誒工作報告，應該咧裏邊都應可以。

567
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:26,000
而係描繪到勾畫出咧，你遇到嘅問題嘅。

568
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:31,130
啊！如果唔係咧，我哋呢個平台咧係冇發揮到最佳嘅作用啊！

569
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:47,260
咁所以我好希望咧，誒，西九管理局誒嗰個管理層咧，可以就住誒呢一個人才培育同埋咧促進自憲者參與呢兩方面嘅工作遇到嘅困難，我強調係困難。

570
02:00:47,540 --> 02:01:07,550
誒向本會咧係作一個報告，譬如話誒頭先，易志明議員都有提到嘅。由我哋呢個小組十一年十年前啦，開始關注呢個西九項目咧，我哋都係誒好關注，尤其是兩方面嘅，就係嗰個教育啊，即係教育咧。

571
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:27,560
係完全決定將來有冇一個足夠嘅觀眾羣或者使用者，噉啊，我哋一直都知道咧，就誒教育局咧喺呢方面係配合唔到嘅。咁但係喺誒即係而家都運作咗誒有幾。

572
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:33,370
年時間咧，我係想知道最新嘅情況係點樣啊？因為我哋係有責任去跟進嘅。

573
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:37,790
另外咧，譬如我哋關心嘅咧，就係誒。

574
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:58,190
頭先我第一次發言嘅時候都提及到啦，好似誒你唔係淨係藝術家啦，藝術家嘅培訓當然我哋都希望聽下管理局誒覺得嚇有冇咩困難啦誒，譬如話你點樣改變嗰啲誒家長對於仔女嘅期望誒點樣？

575
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:07,450
去誒令到吸引一啲年青人誒可以停留喺呢個誒表演藝術文化嘅行業裏邊咧。

576
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:15,300
咁呢個當然我哋都想聽嘅，咁但係咧就呢個可能比較長遠少少嘅一個誒。

577
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:22,300
教育嘅工作係教育啲家長，我諗同埋教育啲年輕人啦。當然都。

578
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:35,950
咁但係我哋另外比較關注咧，就係譬如你嗰啲誒藝術行政人員啊、策展人啊、誒技術人員啊，即係你你有一個演出，可能你有舞台燈光啊，嚇你有誒。

579
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:39,930
誒誒，其他嘅配套啦。

580
02:02:40,300 --> 02:03:00,310
咁嗰啲究竟，譬如喺我哋嘅大學，或者喺我哋嘅誒專業嘅培訓嘅學院嗰度，究竟政府有冇足夠嘅配套，係令到我呢個西九人民西九嘅願景可以落實咧？噉我希望你遲啲交嚟嘅補充文件咧，都可。

581
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:15,570
可以啊，喺呢方面勾畫到出嚟啦。我相信咧，即係主席都會同意咧，亦都我暫時聽唔到我哋有任何屬於呢個聯合小組委員會嘅委員有反對咧。就係我哋會爭取咧，我哋呢個聯合小組委員會咧喺。

582
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:35,860
本屆立法會最後個立法年度咧，都會繼續係誒工作嘅。咁所以今日雖然係呢個立法年度嘅最後嘅會議咧，我哋希望喺下個立法年度咧，我哋係會繼續工作。咁所以誒，如果你交嚟嘅文件，我哋係揾得出我哋嘅入切點，同埋咧係跟進嘅地方咧，我哋必

583
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:41,840
定會發揮呢個平台嘅作用。噉啊，所以希望誒嗰個補充文件咧，係能夠誒。

584
02:03:42,120 --> 02:04:02,130
唔單止今日報咗起啦，報埋個休嚇。我補充係咁多。好多謝副主席，我都有少少意見嘅。咁咧就散會之前咧，我哋好多謝即係各位藝術界或者係誒市民嚟出席今次嘅會議啦。對於份報告咧，我啊覺得咧就誒，我哋今年今屆咧就開過兩次嘅呢啲公聽會嘅。

585
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:22,140
呢個係第二次，噉啊，第二次比第一次咧有見到有啲進步嘅，起碼喺做咗一啲好似社區上邊嘅參與啊，同埋拓展呢啲志願者又係做咗一定嘅工作。但係咧，我覺得都係差強人意嘅，即係你個報告話，即係同藝術界嘅接觸咧，喺五年內咧做咗一百次，你睇嚟好。

586
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:42,150
好多一百次，但係五年喎，一個月你都冇兩次，噉我覺得咧，你係忽略咗我哋本地嘅本土誒地嘅藝術界嘅方面嘅。當然啦，有啲藝術界咧大聲啲噉樣，你係可能見多啲；有啲唔出聲，你就好似冇忽忽略咗佢。我覺得依個咧，作為藝西九藝術區，你喺香

587
02:04:42,150 --> 02:05:02,160
香港呢個地方咧，你唔係一個獨立王國，你應該要接地氣啊嘛。而家卿講你都唔接地嘅，噉你應該要同我哋即係呢個藝術嘅社區啊、藝術界啊，應該有一定嘅緊密嘅接觸，你先至，我覺得先係有生命價值嘅。噉啊，第二咧就係你誒。

588
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:22,170
對現時一啲藝術家或者佢哋而家做緊啲咩嘢，你點樣去支援佢哋？你睇下佢哋有咩需要咧？我覺得呢度應該聽到意見。誒，頭先C C D C咧舞蹈界講嘅意見咧，已經係一個原因，即係你唔夠錢你就縮水，你一縮就啄舞蹈界，將佢原本嗱你。

589
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:42,180
飛碟係全部係做呢個即係誒舞蹈表演嘅一個大嘅即係場地咧。你係變成一個綜合場地，我我個人覺得都係係係好不幸嘅，因為你對舞蹈界嗰個發展咧就可能有一定嘅窒息嚇。噉我覺得依樣嘢你哋真係要重新去考考慮一下。

一個即係你有冇一個標準去去檢去檢定你做嘅嘢夠唔夠？你只不過話畀我聽，我哋係做咗就係你話我唔做咩，我又做啲。咁究竟點樣先係做得夠？點樣做唔夠？你自己都冇個標準。你只不過應酬我哋就做咗啊！我又同邊個合作又做咗一啲行政嘅會會議啊，依又做咗一個啲咩論壇啊。噉我覺得依度咧，我諗。
