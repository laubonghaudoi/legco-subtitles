1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,220
夠鍾夠人，咁麻煩我哋邀請誒局方嘅人入嚟先啦，同埋競委會嘅人。

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,770
你冇㗎嘛？

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,060
活。

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,950
冇。

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,550
咩美服務啊？

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,800
grow.

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,330
先生。

8
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:34,670
歡迎誒司法機關同埋嚇經委會嘅誒人員嚟到今日我哋呢個委員會啦嚇咁誒。自從上次開會之後咧，誒我知道司法機關咧就有兩份文件入咗嚟嘅，噉係誒某部某程度上都係答翻上一次有啲委員提出嘅一啲疑問。

9
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:54,790
咁或者我邀請阿張女士啦，係解解嗰兩份文件，講講嚇。好唔該，主席。誒，正如主席頭先提到咧，我哋上一次咧，委員會係有誒誒一啲嘅即係提出嘅問題或者事項啦。噉我哋第一份嘅文件咧就係應啊委員嘅要求咧，係將我哋咧。

10
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:14,800
曾經同大律師公會同埋律師誒誒公會咧，佢哋之間就住呢一套有關嘅規則，即係誒競爭事務審裁處嘅規則嘅一啲嘅意見嘅書信嘅往來咧，我哋係全套咧，係將一套咧係拎畀誒委員會係參考㗎。咁如果誒，我今日就唔喺度再詳細講，但係咧簡單地嚟説咧，大律師公會咧係。

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:33,490
全部咧係支持咧，我哋而家提交畀立法會嘅有關嘅一個嘅誒誒草案嘅規則，而律師公會咧誒亦都係誒整體咧係支持嘅。噉我哋有一啲嘅意見咧，我哋亦都係誒全部係即係誒作出咗我哋嘅回應㗎。咁所以睇下誒委員有冇誒意見或者想我特別再誒？

12
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,050
誒特別抽某一啲可以，如果唔係就可以。

13
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:57,700
律師會嗰度有啲誒誒，即係你哋回應啦。你啊，我知道你唔係話充分全面接納曬佢有啲意見，你可唔可以講講有啲邊啲你係冇接納到同埋嗰個原因，或者？其實一個最重要一個我哋並冇接納嘅咧，就係一個誒，一個出庭發言權嘅一個噉嘅事項㗎。因為律師公會咧會好希望我。

14
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:17,710
哋咧能夠畀事務律師咧係可以第日咧係可以就似普通嘅一個即係誒所謂嘅大狀噉樣咧係上嚟呢一個競爭事務審裁處咧係做一個出庭嘅發言權㗎。噉我哋詳細咧向誒律師公會解釋咧呢個誒，因為呢個嘅競爭事務審裁處咧其實係等同於一個高級嘅記錄法院，即係話。

15
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:37,720
係等於原眾庭，即係高等法院一樣嘅噉樣嘅，即係一個規格嘅法庭嚟㗎。噉我哋咧就係其實喺二零零九年咧喺修改呢一個法律執業者條例嘅時候咧，已經當時達到個共識，就即係話唔係所有嘅事務律師都可以上嚟高院咧有個出庭發言權㗎，係必須佢哋咧係落攞得某一啲特定嘅資。

16
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:57,730
依家係成為呢個重辯嘅律師咧，先至係可以上嚟高院啊，有個噉嘅出庭嘅發言權㗎。咁呢件事咧，我嘅理解咧，係零九年嘅時候，因為仲有個大例嘅修訂㗎，係經過好多嘅討論、好多嘅諮詢，點樣平衡大律師同埋事務律師嘅一啲嘅唔同嘅interest咧，而係達到個共識㗎。噉我哋睇得到咧，競爭事務審裁處其實只

17
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:17,740
係一個高院嘅一個，好似一個即係延續噉樣㗎。咁所以個出庭嘅發言權咧，應該係同高院咧係相同㗎。咁所以咧，我哋並並未能咧係接納呢個建議。而事實上喺舊年我哋進行競爭事務誒誒競爭條例嘅一個嘅誒修訂嘅時候咧，亦都係將呢件事係同樣咧係拎到去。

18
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:37,750
有關嘅誒誒，Bill Committee即係法案委員會都討論過㗎。噉我哋亦都已經在喺就住，因為當時有一個相應嘅大例嘅修訂咧，就係要修改呢個誒法律執業者條例嘅。我哋已經修訂咗咧，係令到咧競爭事務審裁處嗰個出庭嘅發言權咧，係只係係講從事務律師嚟講咧，係只係侷限於能誒。

19
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:57,760
個即係能夠誒有呢個重辯律師資格嘅嘅嗰啲嘅事務律師嘅，咁所以我哋亦都好難喺呢一度再將呢個啱啱已經改號嘅誒帶嚟再作修訂。呢個我明白嘅。我想知道，如果內庭審訊咧，誒律師係誒，就算佢冇高等法院嘅發言權啦，佢都係可以出席㗎嘛？

20
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:17,770
代表客人係嘛？誒係可以㗎，因為而家總之而家今日誒原仲庭係點樣嘅話咧，未來誒競爭事務審裁處嘅做法都係一樣㗎，即係淨係open court嘅時候，佢哋唔能夠上嚟嘅啫。我想問問競委會嗰度嗰個安排，如果第時譬如你哋有誒一啲啊啊內即係內部嘅律師in-house lawyer。

21
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,860
佢哋會唔會亦都打算係會親自代表競委會出庭？而嗰個安排會係點樣？

22
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,240
maybe Mr. Monaghan, you can.

23
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,200
brief us on this issue.

24
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:50,180
Thank you, chairman. For the question, I think in terms of how the Commission might represent itself in the tribunal, if of course we had lawyers internally with the requisite rights of audience, then potentially we would we would take that avenue. Failing that, we would plan to instruct.

25
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,550
律師代表委員會，律師代表委員會。

26
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:07,100
And you have the budget needed to instruct external counsel if necessary, or is that something that you you would like to see more support provided for the commission?

27
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,750
No, we have a budget allocation for that for that purpose. Okay.

28
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:33,820
誒張張女士，請繼續啦。好啊。誒，多謝主席。或者咁咧，我跟住落嚟咧就會係誒，或者簡介一下第二份我哋提交嘅文件㗎。咁個文件咧就係因為誒上一誒個題目咧就係誒誒，我哋就係暫時淨係得英文版嘅，係講係呢個follow-on action，即係後續訴訟嘅程序裏邊咧，有冇一啲可以進一步簡化嘅空間嘅？

29
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:47,880
咁咧誒，或者我先誒詳細講下嗰個有關嘅文件啦。因為咧上一次誒委員喺上次嘅會議裏邊咧，就住呢個後續嘅訴訟嘅程序咧，係作咗一啲嘅建議㗎。咁司法機構咧向議員發出有關嘅文件啦，我而家係向大家簡介。

30
00:06:48,160 --> 00:07:08,170
咁首先作少少嘅背景先啦。根據咧競爭條例第一百一十一條一百一十條咧，任何人因為裁定咗進行咗一個反競爭嘅行為嘅時候而蒙受損失嘅話咧，係可以提出嘅訴訟㗎。我哋叫呢個做後續訴訟。咁首先咧，我哋要強調嘅咧就係我哋誒唔應該咧低估後續訴訟一啲複雜嘅程度㗎。

31
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:28,180
咁以下落嚟咧係有四點係作為一個嘅解釋。第一，後續訴訟所涉及嘅複雜嘅程度嘅差異咧係可以非常之大㗎。由最簡單嘅案件咧，可能係同原訟庭損害嘅賠償嘅申訴（damage claims）裏邊係冇重大法律責任爭議嘅案件咧，係可能好相似㗎。但係同樣對去到一啲最

32
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:36,130
複雜嘅案件咧，可能會涉及一啲大額嘅申索啦，同埋係涉納一啲好難處理嘅事實同埋法律嘅問題㗎。

33
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:56,850
第二係我哋預期咧，誒呢一個誒後續嘅訴訟咧，多數咧唔會淨係關乎一個消費者，因為買咗一啲比較貴嘅貨物咧而起訴有關嘅公司。我哋相信咧，好經常發生嘅應該會係由一間即係好似一般嘅商業訴訟噉，係由一間公司係去係對另外一間公司提出申訴。

34
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,300
㗎。

35
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:17,890
第三個第三點咧，就係話，就算反競爭行為獲得裁定咧，並唔代表法律責任嘅問題咧已經係解決㗎，因為後續訴訟嘅被告人咧，仍然可以提出抗辯，指咧被裁定嘅行為咧並冇引致咧一個後續訴訟原告人嘅損失㗎。咁呢個咧係商業訴

36
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:24,690
仲同埋競爭事務訴訟本質上面嘅困難，我哋並唔能夠藉住簡化程序咧，係去解決㗎。

37
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:38,030
而第四就話，即使嗰啲法律責任唔受爭議嘅案件，原告人仍然需要證明損失嗰個確實嘅程度，以及將個損失量化成為金額，並且係加以證明㗎。

38
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:58,380
簡單地嚟説咧，由於我哋上述所講有關法律嘅責任同埋損失程度呢啲嘅事情咧，同埋呢個經委會同埋被告人喺強制執行嘅過程裏邊咧係並無關係㗎，所以我哋唔能夠咧提早喺強制執行階段嘅時候去處理有關呢個後續訴訟嘅一啲嘅嘅事情㗎，而且。

39
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:18,390
且後續訴訟嘅原告人咧，並唔會係咧係早前強製法執行法律程序嘅訴訟人㗎。咁所以上次部分嘅議員咧曾經提出，係咪可以喺強制執行嘅階段嘅時候咧，由審裁處或者係其他人擬備一個名單，係列出一啲可能蒙受損失人士嘅嘅嘅嘅名字嘅話？

40
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,350
話咧，我哋認為喺法律上並不恰當嘅。

41
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:42,540
第二個部分咧，就係喺裁定呢一個有關後續訴訟嘅程序嘅時候咧，我哋咧想重申嘅就係司法機構咧係需要致力係令到審裁處喺符合秉承公義嘅原則下邊咧能夠儘量係不拘形式，但係同時咧，我哋亦都要確保審裁處係有所有相關嘅資料，希望能夠盡快。

42
00:09:42,540 --> 00:10:02,550
同埋公平噉樣咧，係處理有關嘅案件㗎。所以按住呢個原則咧，我哋係提出有關程序嘅建議嘅時候咧，其實係有兩好重要嘅原則同埋做法喺文件亦都開列咗嘅。第一就係我哋咧係必須有個大前提，就係要確保咧係所有有需需必須嘅資料咧係應該要盡快提交畀呢一個嘅。

43
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:22,560
審裁處，以免咧係拖延咧呢個有關嘅法律嘅程序。不過喺個大前提之下咧，我哋會去盡量簡化有關嘅程序同埋需要提交嘅資料㗎。第二個大嘅原則咧就係我哋認為咧審裁處係需要適當嘅權力㗎，係可以視乎呢個案件嘅複雜程度啦、性質同埋申訴嘅金額。

44
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:42,570
咧係考慮採用係合適嘅唔同嘅程序，係需要時咧係進一步去再簡化有關嘅處理嘅方法嘅。咁或者咧，如果誒委員建議，我比較想詳細少少講下呢兩個原則點引申係我哋而家嘅一套建議嘅規則裏邊㗎。第一方面咧就係有關點去簡化個程序同埋誒提交資料方面嘅，譬如我哋已經喺。

45
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:56,810
呢一個審裁處嘅規則第五部分有關後續訴訟嗰度咧，係建議使用表格，就係令到訴訟人能夠用最簡單嘅方式咧列出佢提出申索嘅時候一啲嘅理由。呢個我哋相信係有助去減省呢個嘅仲費㗎。

46
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:17,320
喺上次嘅會議上邊，有議員係提出係咪可以將我哋而家誒審裁處規則嘅第九十三條同埋第第九十四條下邊需要提交嘅資料合拼。簡單嚟講，即係話可唔可以將表格八同埋表格一等咧呢兩種嘅文件咧呢兩堆要求嘅文件嘅資料咧係合拼㗎？咁或者我哋首先係簡單去。

47
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:37,330
誒解釋下兩種嘅申請咧，係即係九十三同埋九十四條申請咧嘅目的同埋佢哋所需要嘅資料都係唔同㗎。第九十四條係講緊誒訴訟人如果係想尋求審裁處嘅準許，當佢哋嘅有關上訴仲未曾完成之前咧，係想提早提出呢一個後續嘅訴訟，所以。

48
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:45,090
計計九十四條要處理，係一個時間嘅問題。咁所以所提出嘅申請要提交嘅資料咧，就係相當係簡單嘅。

49
00:11:45,510 --> 00:12:05,520
但係第九十三條咧，就係一個喺後續訴訟嚟比較正式提出嘅申請，即係話申請人係需要提出嘅資料係會比較多㗎，例如去講下申訴嘅基礎啦，同埋要求賠償嘅金額等等㗎。咁所以嘅資料比較長進㗎。噉我哋因為誒議員委員嘅提議咧，我哋翻去咧都仔細思量，係咪有空間咧可以將。

50
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:25,530
將呢兩個嘅文件係合拼㗎，噉我哋認為咧都係唔適宜嘅。主要嘅原因就係我哋恐怕所謂一個front loading of course，即係咧，即係當依個嘅誒，即係譬如我哋需要合拼咗嘅時候，即係話訴訟人可能根本連法庭都未曾準許可以提早提出呢一個嘅申請嘅時候，佢已經要交埋咧佢個。

51
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:37,850
好詳細誒第九十三條要求嘅資料，噉我哋覺得咧對一般嘅訴訟人嚟講咧，都可能係會只係不必要地增加佢哋嘅綜費嘅，咁所以我哋唔建議將兩個嘅文件係合平㗎。

52
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:58,730
咁亦都，我繼續講第二方面。我第二個原則咧，就係點樣能夠賦予誒審裁處有足夠嘅權力。誒，因為上一次咧，委員咧係建議我哋司法機構咧係考慮係咪可以賦予審裁處有更大嘅權力，令到咧我哋法官咧可以因應嘅需要咧再去加快呢個程序㗎。咁司法機構其實係好同意咧。

53
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:18,740
審裁處應該係獲予足夠嘅權力，可以去靈活處理唔同複雜程度、唔同申訴金額嘅一啲嘅個案㗎。咁事實上咧，喺我哋已經提交立法會嘅審裁處嘅規則裏邊咧，我哋其實咧係有五個方面咧，已經係開列咗我哋誒審裁處啲法官誒有嘅權力嘅，亦都文件亦都開列好簡單。

54
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:38,750
單你咁講一講，第一就審裁處咧，好係好多靈活使用程序嘅空間，例如佢哋可以用簡易判決summary judgment，亦都可以咧去限制文件透露嘅範圍咧，去減省呢一個嘅重費。第二，我哋都建議咧，當呢個訴訟人提交手輪資料之後咧，審裁處係隨即係舉行一個所謂指示嘅令。

55
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,870
聆訊direction hearing就希望令到個別嘅案件咧係可以誒法官會為佢哋制定一個最合適嘅程序。

56
00:13:46,150 --> 00:14:06,160
而第三咧就係審裁處係有權係視乎需要嘅情況咧，係指示高院規則係唔適用嘅，係進一步可以簡化有關嘅步驟。而第四咧，一般嚟講，即使出現唔遵守程序規則嘅情況，審裁處亦都唔會咧係視嗰個法法律嘅程序係為無效㗎。而最後。

57
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:26,170
審裁處咧係可以主動或者係應申請咧係將雙例嘅案件合併㗎，因為上次議員嘅意見咧，司法機構翻到即係我哋誒內部咧，亦都再重新檢視一下上述提出嘅權力。噉我哋認為咧，應該咁頭先即係頭先所開啲嘅權力咧，應該係已經足夠令到審裁處咧去按需要。

58
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:46,180
要唔同嘅案件嘅複雜程度、申訴金額同佢哋嘅性質咧，係可以適當噉樣加快處理後續嘅訴訟㗎。事實上咧，根據我哋好多個法院，包括原眾庭嘅經驗嚟睇咧，就算係冇律師代表嘅誒訴訟人咧，佢哋大部分都能夠依照規定咧，將佢哋要提出申訴嘅詳細嘅情況咧，係以表格嘅形。

59
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:53,210
或者係文件開裂嘅，如果佢哋真係有困難嘅時候，審裁處就跌而家袁仲平一樣咧，係會提供協助㗎。

60
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:14,170
咁另外誒，最後一方面咧，就係議員喺上次嘅會議上面咧，亦都有提出我哋可唔可以進一步咧係簡化有關後續訴訟嘅程序㗎。基於我哋頭先啱啱提到嘅分析咧，我哋認為可以再簡化嘅程序嘅空間咧，其實係唔多嘅。不過因為議員嘅關注咧，我哋亦都再重新睇一睇咧誒有關九十三條。

61
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:34,180
嗰個嘅誒，即係誒某啲地方咧可以再簡化㗎。噉我哋喺提交畀誒議員嘅文件嘅第十七段咧，係提出修改第九十三條，係畀呢個訴訟啊，可以喺合適嘅情況之下，例如佢冇啲商業敏感嘅資料需要透露嘅話咧，可以將表格八嘅一個元數申索通知書，同埋跟住要。

62
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:54,190
要再提交嘅申索陳述書（statement of claim）嘅內容咧，係合並提交㗎。我哋亦都進一步咧喺表格八裏邊咧，係提供更多嘅指引，希望令到訴訟人咧更加瞭解一般咧喺申索陳述誒陳述書即係statement of claim所需要提交其實嗰啲嘅具體嘅資料係啲咩嘢㗎。咁誒，如果委員喺原則上，

63
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:07,940
上面同意有關嘅修訂嘅話咧，司法機構係會將上述嘅變動咧係納入去呢個審裁處嘅規則裏邊嘅。誒，多謝主席，我嘅簡介嚟到呢一度。OK，或者我問問委員又係依依一方面有冇咩問題？

64
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,870
係，啊法律顧問。

65
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:33,560
係，多謝主席。主席，嗯，就住阿張女士剛才所講到嗰個議議嘅修訂咧，咁主席就其實係文件入邊嘅第十七段啦。咁亦都當中，嗯，政府當局亦都提供咗一個附件，就係一個誒標明文本嘅修議修訂嚟嘅。咁主席值得留意嘅咧，就係正如張女士頭先所講咧。

66
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:53,590
咁而家嗰個已修訂咧，就係簡單啲嚟到講咧，就係如果要提起一個後續訴訟嘅話咧，就係有第九十三條第一款A或者B兩種方式啦。A段嗰個誒方式咧，就係要提交呢個表格八入邊咧，就已經係即係誒囊括埋原本係會喺。

67
00:16:53,590 --> 00:17:13,600
誒申訴陳述書入邊所講嘅內容喺度啦，咁而B個方法咧就係要獨立地咧提交一份申訴陳述書嘅。咁主席，我理解咧就係，正如阿張女士頭先所講，同埋喺相關嘅表格八後邊有一個註腳五咧，都有提到咧B段咧就有講到點解即係會係有可。

68
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:33,610
可能係需要提交一份獨立嘅申索陳述書咧，就係如果相關嘅人士咧係希望可以將申索陳述書入邊嘅一啲資料咧，係用保密嘅方式去處理咧，就會噉樣做。咁主要而家點要需要留意嘅咧，就係我哋留意得到咧，其實而家議規則嘅第五十五同埋五十六條咧，就係關於誒訴訟嘅。

69
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:53,620
各方同埋公眾人士咧，係咩情況底下咧可以查閲一啲誒叫做原素文件咧？英文叫做originating document。咁主席，我哋留意得到咧。如果我哋睇翻《議議嗰個規則》嘅第二條第一款，就住原素文件嗰個定義咧，A段係咁講嘅。主席，我引述：凡在審裁主

70
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:13,630
進行的法律程序是藉將某文件送交全黨而展開的，指該文件。主要簡單啲講咧，即係其實嗰個誒定義嘅意思就係話咧，你第一份提交畀審裁處去展開嗰個法律程序嗰份文件咧，就叫做原屬文件啦。咁如果根據而家嗰個已修訂咧，如果相

71
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:33,640
關嘅人士係需要提交一份表格八，再加埋一份獨立嘅申索陳述書嘅時候咧，會唔會兩份文件喺呢個定義底下都會係構成一個元數文件，就變咗喺公眾人士去查閲呢啲文件嘅時候咧，都可以攞到咧咁咁？主席，我理解得到咧，其實司法機構一直以嚟喺誒。

72
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:53,650
高等法院原眾法庭嗰個實際嗰個運作嘅時候咧，其實佢哋就只會係將第一份嘅文件咧，先至係會係公即係公眾人士去查閲嘅。咁而嗰個政策原意咧，其實佢哋意思就係話，只會係希望將嗰個表格八咧係可以公查閲，但係如果係一個獨立提交。

73
00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:13,660
交嘅一份新索陳述書咧，如果入邊有一啲機密嘅資料，希望予以機密嘅處理嘅話咧，嗰份文件就並唔會係第五十五同埋五十六條入邊係會可以即係供相關人士查閲嘅。咁但係，主席，我哋嘅關注咧就係現時嗰個寫法咧係咪可以反映到嗰個政策嘅原意啫？咁所以即係誒政府。

74
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:33,670
會當局誒，亦都可能需要翻去考慮一下，即係而家嗰個誒草擬方式係咪需要進一步嘅修訂咧？唔該，主席。張女士誒，多謝主席，多謝法律顧問嘅誒提議啊！我哋其實咧亦都誒理解到呢一個誒，其實正如頭先嘅法律顧問講咧，一路嘅高院嘅安排咧都係即係無論用reach啊，或者係用其他嘢咧，都係嗰個誒。

75
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:53,680
啊，第一份即係嗰個誒皮咧，我哋叫皮covering咧，就係會係公眾人士可以去抄誒去去攞得到嘅。而入邊黐住一啲嘅皮細章嗰啲嘢咧，都係唔會畀公眾人士睇到嘅，除非有特別嘅安排。咁所以咧，呢個嘅噉嘅安排咧，應該係喺個原眾庭咧，係一個已經係即係行之有效嘅方法嚟㗎。咁但係誒誒，而家嚟到咧就。

76
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:13,690
唔係一個即係安排嘅問題啦。咁法律顧問提出嘅係一個草擬法例嘅問題，即係話有冇好處咧？為咗增加我哋嗰個即係法律嘅清楚度嘅話咧，係我哋再可以喺誒我哋第二條嘅規則嘅誒有關呢一個元素文件嘅定義，再詳細講翻邊啲係屬於個所謂嘅元素文件，邊啲係唔屬於嘅話，呢個我哋係可。

77
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,360
可以考慮係將嗰個誒草擬嘅方法係改善嘅。

78
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:37,650
係啊，我同意法律顧問嘅觀點啦。因為誒，如果你而家任何人士去高等法院嗰個誒誒誒去查閲一啲文件嘅時候咧，嗯，確實係譬如喺司法複核案件咧，係有混亂嘅情況出現，就係因為正正頭先法律顧問提出個點，究竟咩係原數文件咧？

79
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:57,660
係嗰個定義唔清楚咁而家其實，如果照你而家嗰個寫法咧，就係話公眾人士可以係去查一個誒誒Form A係嘛？係。但係如果佢個Form A本身冇個誒誒一個申索書嘅Statement of Claim嘅話咧，噉佢就查唔到睇唔到係啦。佢唔會即刻查到。

80
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:17,670
但係，如果要查咧，得到法庭嘅同意都可以，即係變咗要需要一個要有個關卡係啦。我哋睇下應唔應該出，即係畀其他人知道。嗯，但係實際運作嘅時候咧，就係由嗰個原訴人自己去決定點樣去去做咯。其實誒好多時可能佢覺得有冇誒一啲保密嘅，即係需要保密嘅。

81
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,490
嘅資料咧，係完全係佢自己決定嘅啫。

82
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:40,870
誒係啊，因為我哋而家係高等法院嘅安排都係噉樣嘅。佢自己覺得有冇啲嘢，我唔想畀人知誒。有啲又覺得冇乜所謂嘅噉，所以我哋就畀一個彈性佢。我哋而家提出嘅誒所謂嘅修訂咧，就係畀個彈性佢。佢自己覺得我冇嘢係需要隱瞞嘅噉。舉個例，我想成我就好想人哋知添，有啲可能噉，佢就可以自己一套。

83
00:21:40,870 --> 00:22:00,880
即係同一個，即係已經組整合咗嘅表格八一次個畀我哋。係，但係佢覺得有憂慮嘅，噉佢就自己去拆開嚟交畀我哋。噉我哋淨係會畀公眾人士咧，係攞到第一份嗰個誒表格八，就攞唔到下邊嗰statement of claim啦。明白。不過你可以研究下法律顧問頭先提出個觀點，喺嗰個誒措辭方。

84
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:20,890
面可唔可以清晰啲去講？究竟乜嘢係可以去查閲，乜嘢係唔可以噉樣？誒好啊，多謝主席。而事實上，我哋就算誒喺文件度提交個附件嗰個嘅草擬，都係只係一個即係一個提議、一個原則嘅提議。我哋翻去亦都會再細化、再即係，因為時間關係，我哋都係好急噉樣做咗個建議出嚟。噉我哋喺即係個drafting。

85
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,170
草業會都會再一路誒一路改善嘅。好啊，OK。

86
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,970
就住呢個新提出嘅修訂，委員有冇咩問題？

87
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,750
或者競委會有冇咩問題？如果冇嘅話，嗯。

88
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,400
No, no, no comment. Thank you.

89
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:49,540
噉係咯，咁或者下次你可以誒，如果研究咗有啲咩更改，可以再拎上嚟委員會度進行討論下，好。

90
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,150
噉就住呢兩個文件啊啊，張女士，你仲冇咩補充？冇啦，唔該主席。OK。

91
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:04,610
噉我哋誒或者邀請咧，就係經委會，我知道就寫一封信去畀誒。

92
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:18,290
誒呢個委員會啦，就係依個三月三十號二零一五年。Maybe I invite誒Mr. Morgan to誒誒explain the contents of your letter dated the thirtieth March, two thousand and fifteen.

93
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:39,200
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, during the last meeting of the subcommittee, a question was addressed to the Commission as to whether we could provide legal assistance to claimants under the ordinance wishing to file a collective claim in the tribunal with a view to reducing claimants' legal

94
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,020
costs.

95
00:23:40,300 --> 00:24:00,310
The first point here is, of course, we don't have a statutory function of providing legal advice to would-be plaintiffs. And moreover, any advice that we might seek to provide would not be protected by legal privilege. That said, there are, of course, a number

96
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:19,630
of things we can do to help claimants seek compensation, and I think the key word is compensation because there are a number of different ways claimants can seek compensation, and follow-on damages actions is one possibility, but there are others, as I'll explain in a minute.

97
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,950
嗯。

98
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:41,330
As Ms. Chung has explained, follow-on action is provided for in the ordinance. There is no possibility of standalone action. Parties cannot sue unless the Commission has first taken a case against parties, and the Tribunal has established that there is a contravention of the ordinance.

99
00:24:41,330 --> 00:25:01,340
或如果如果一個人有做過一個承諾，這個承諾已經被委員會接受，這個人違反了競爭法令。在這種情況下，也是有可能採取後續行動。在某種意義上，

100
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:21,350
The fact that the Commission has to establish an infringement first before the Tribunal, that is a mechanism which relieves the plaintiff of the burden of establishing that there is an infringement. So to that extent, the ordinance has an inbuilt mechanism which reduces legal costs.

101
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:38,060
for plaintiffs, they are left to establish the issues that they are best placed to establish: causation and damages. Of course, parties can make a complaint to the Commission if they are concerned by anti-competitive conduct.

102
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:58,790
And the Commission can, in addition, of course, to seeking financial penalty or otherwise resolving its its concerns with the contravening party, can seek different types of orders from the tribunal. So, financial penalty is one possibility.

103
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:18,800
of directors is another, but the Commission can also seek an award of damages for victims and/or and I use the term damages here loosely to include also the possibility of restitution or other other compensation. So there is possible under the ordinance for

104
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:38,810
The Commission to seek those sorts of remedies on behalf of claimants, if and if you like, that obviates the need for the claimant then to take the follow-on action. Not every case would be appropriate for that sort of remedy. Certain cases would be more appropriate than other.

105
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:58,820
We could seek that sort of remedy in the original proceedings to establish an infringement, whether they are contested, or whether there are consent proceedings. We might agree with the contravening party that they should make some sort of restitution to claim.

106
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,810
嗯。

107
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:18,130
similarly, we might in the context of an immunity agreement that we would conclude under section 80 of the ordinance with a contravening party, we might impose a condition of restitution of some kind. Now, I say that.

108
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:38,550
with with paying paying attention to the fact of course that we have not yet firmly finalised our leniency policy but that is a possibility that we could consider in any event when we do finalise the leniency policy or the immunity policy we will have regard to the fact that that.

109
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:58,560
Policy should not function so as to preclude claimants from seeking compensation for their private losses. In addition to the sorts of sort of compensation or restitution type remedy that we might look for, overseas and overseas jurisprudence provides examples of that in Australia.

110
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:18,570
For example, the ATRC or the Australian Competition Authority can seek compensation on behalf of victims. In the US, the Department of Justice can seek restitution on behalf of victims. And indeed, restitution was ordered in the recent air cargo cases. Certain airlines have.

111
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:38,580
要 make restitution as part of their settlement with the Department of Justice. There are also possibilities for more novel arrangements or more experimental arrangements, if you like, depending on the facts of the case. We might seek an order obliging the contravening parties to establish a fund.

112
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:58,590
which victims could make a claim on, and that sort of mechanism has been used in the United Kingdom in a recent case concerning the fixing of prices in respect of private schools. The schools were obligated to establish and run a fund that claimants could draw on. So those are different ways.

113
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:18,600
of lowering the cost in a sense for claimants, whether one would you know choose to pursue those sorts of remedies in a particular case would depend on a number of factors. But one factor clearly would be whether the victims concerned were likely to take.

114
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:38,610
follow-on action or whether they were not well placed to do that, that would be a consideration in terms of whether you would pursue this sort of remedy. Equally, you would have to look at the facts of the case. For restitution, you'd need to be able to determine how much money had been earned by the contravening conduct. What

115
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:51,050
Had been made, and you'd need to be able to do that with some precision, and you'd need to be able to determine who should get what proportion of the profit. So there are certain factors which would favour that sort of remedy.

116
00:29:51,490 --> 00:30:11,500
In addition, of course, we have a general policy of promoting or publicising the outcomes of our cases, and that means that parties will know whether an infringement has occurred and whether there is.

117
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:31,510
Whether they might have a right to seek some sort of compensation, we could certainly, in that context, encourage the victims or potential victims to discuss together in terms of assessing whether they might want to consolidate or work together in terms of seeking a claim, and that might lower legal costs. Or we could encourage

118
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:51,520
encourage a dialogue with the contravening parties, and that might allow for a settlement and compensation without having to resort to a follow-on damages action. Of course, the Commission would also have in its possession, following its investigation, evidence of the contravention, potentially evidence concerning the.

119
00:30:51,520 --> 00:31:07,230
實際 harm that victims suffered, and all of that evidence would be, or certainly most of that evidence would be available to claimants through the discovery process.

120
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:27,520
finally in terms of the Commission's possibility to get involved in in follow-on actions itself, we can intervene in in those sorts of actions. We don't yet have a policy as to what sort of cases we we or where we might intervene, but relevant considerations might be whether there were.

121
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:47,530
important legal questions that needed to be answered, whether perhaps there were arguments around disclosure that we had a particular interest in, or indeed questions concerning the calculation of damages. There may be questions where we would be well placed to offer review, having already undertaken an assessment of the harm.

122
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:53,390
造成由違法行為所引致的罰款，由我們在之前的執法程序中所造成的。

123
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,180
and that that summarises the the content of the letter, Jim.

124
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,470
Thank you.

125
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,690
誒有冇委員有問題喺依一方面？

126
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,760
法律顧問。

127
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,590
OK。

128
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,470
即係嗰個。

129
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,390
係。

130
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:35,180
如果委員冇其他問題嘅話咧，我諗我哋可以進入誒下一個階段，就係逐字審議。但係咧誒，即係我知道，即係局誒司法機關話下一次會再有一啲誒，即係你考慮完之後可能會有啲修改。不過我覺得唔阻我哋繼續下一步去開始逐字審議。

131
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,080
如果係噉嘅話，我哋。

132
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,310
我冇講。

133
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,880
Karu Cinema。

134
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,360
或者你講。

135
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:04,350
主席，誒或者即係睇下張律師佢哋係咪，如果想開始嗰個逐條審議，係咪會先做咗嗰個競爭事務審裁處規則先，即係喺提交個文件個附件A先。

136
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,510
誒好啊！誒如果主席同主席同意嘅話，我哋先做誒附件A。好啊。

137
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,380
真係唔需要嘅。

138
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,650
睇到後咪。

139
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,020
佢哋就冇嗰份。

140
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:37,060
Mr. Malikan, we are going to go to our next stage of scrutinising the provisions by provision of the rules. You don't have to stay, but you're more than welcome to stay if you you want to. And if you need the documents, I can ask the secretary to provide you with a set of the draft rules.

141
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:48,510
I have I have the documents, but I can I can stay if you wish, Chairman. If I leave it to you, okay, that would be great. Chairman， is it？麻煩你開始。好多謝主席。

142
00:33:48,790 --> 00:34:08,800
啊，或者我哋咧誒，就係睇附件A啦。競爭事務審裁處嘅規則，第一條係有關生效日期呢個規則咧，係會等呢個高等法院首席法官咧係以憲報嘅形式咧公告咧，先至會生效呢一堆嘅規則㗎。我哋預期呢一套嘅規則咧，會喺主體條例全面實施嘅時候同時生效。

143
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:20,790
O.K.第二條咧係有關定義嘅，或者我唔再詳細。不過咧，頭先正如法律顧問提出咧，我哋翻去係會考慮將原訴文件嘅定義咧，係將佢係細化。

144
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,020
係。

145
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,180
第三條係有關咧係規則，張女士請等等，法律顧問。

146
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:46,470
係，多謝主主席就住第二條定義嗰度咧，其實誒主席，我哋較早之前咧就寫咗封信去誒司法機構咧，就轉呢一個草擬本咧有啲提問嘅。咁文件編號咧就係CB固4739斜洞14至15固01號文件嘅。咁即誒張女士佢哋亦都已經即係作出咗一個書面。

147
00:34:46,470 --> 00:35:06,480
嘅回覆啦。咁主席就住第二條第一款入邊嗰個定義咧，我哋有其中一個提問咧，就係關到關係到誒英文party中文一方或者方嗰個定義啊。咁主席，我哋見到佢A段嗰度咧，入邊就有提到一個叫介入者英文叫intervener嘅。噉我哋留意得到咧。

148
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:26,490
其實喺誒呢一個誒草案入邊嗰個條文咧，喺之後嘅第二十條同埋二十一條咧，都有講到相關人士係即係得到誒誒準許之後咧，就係可以介入相關嘅法律程序，亦都包括咧，經委會可以根據第二十一條咧，亦都可以介入嘅。咁即係我哋就係從一。

149
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:46,500
喺個草擬角度睇睇咧，就係誒可唔可以喺就住一方嘅A段入邊關於介入者個定義咧，就講清楚係咪就係講緊第二十條同埋包括埋二十一條，經委會即係都會係可以跌入呢一個個介入者個定義咧。噉，我哋見到得到咧B段咧喺講到。

150
00:35:46,500 --> 00:36:04,870
即係英文叫interest party嘅時候咧，都有再提述另一啲條文，就譬如第六十四條咁噉。咁所以我哋就即係留意得到，即係係咪可以即係如果清晰起見，就喺A段關於個介入者就可以講清楚，係即係第二十條同埋第二十一條嗰個指明嘅介入者。咁從一個準確角度，明白。

151
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:25,210
嚇，張女士係多謝主席。誒，介入呢個概念咧，其實喺《主體法例》咧第一百二十條已經係誒開列咗出嚟㗎。誒，即係簡單嚟講，介入咧，並並唔係喺呢個規則裏邊新誒引入嘅一個概念。不過，我哋理解到啊，法律顧問提出嘅係一個草擬上面嘅一個，即係純粹一個即係容易啲睇一啲，容易啲明一啲噉。

152
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:45,220
我哋原則上係冇問題嘅。我哋翻嚟亦都可以考慮咧，係誒加入一個新嘅定義畀呢個介入者。不過，我哋要留意到，因為大例已經有，我哋要小心一啲，即係草擬嗰個有關嘅。即係，但係而家呢個介入者intervener咧，係包括埋誒第二十一段嗰度講話，即係經委會會係誒能夠即係。

153
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:52,950
申請去介入呢一個，呢一個其實係包咗喺呢個誒二A段嗰個intervener嗰個。

154
00:36:53,230 --> 00:37:11,800
係啊，即係第日嗰個誒介入者可以係競委會，亦都可以係其他相關嘅人士嘅。咁可能好簡單就寫清楚，就係誒講明就係二十同埋二十一段啦，都係包括喺呢個介入者呢一個定義裏邊噉樣。係，我哋會從呢個方向去考慮嘅。OK，好，請繼續。

155
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:34,950
誒，如果繼續，我可以繼續。第三條係第三條嘅規則咧，就係説明咧，我哋而家呢套嘅規則裏邊咧，唔同部分適用嘅範圍㗎。譬如第二部分咧，就係講所有審裁處進行嘅程序一般嘅規則；第三部分係講關於咧可以複核經委會一啲嘅可複核裁定一啲嘅特定嘅規則，而第四。

156
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:47,450
部分咧就係講緊強制執行嘅一啲特定嘅規則。第五部分就係講緊誒後續訴訟嘅特定規則，而第六部分咧就係講緊呢一啲從誒原眾法庭移交過嚟啲法律程序嘅一啲特定嘅規則。OK。

157
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,520
係。

158
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,810
誒，跟住落嚟咧係。

159
00:37:52,090 --> 00:38:12,100
第四條，第四條咧係講明咧高院規則嘅適用嘅範圍㗎。噉我哋咧係由誒呢一條嘅規則係有兩個部分㗎。第一個部分咧就係表明，如果喺競爭條例嘅主體法例或者係規則裏邊咧係冇就某一件事情作出規定嘅話咧，高院規則就會喺適用嘅範圍裏邊咧係適用喺審。

160
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:20,260
裁處啦，咁咧因為就可以避免咧，我哋要抄好多咧高院規則嘅一啲嘅條文嚟到呢個審裁處嘅規則嘅裏邊㗎。

161
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:38,040
係。咁而第二個部分咧，就係講緊係誒Subrule三嗰度咧，就係咧表明審裁處可以喺某啲情況下邊，例如係符合秉行公義嘅原則，或者係節省仲費等等咧，係指示咧高院規則咧係唔適用於一個特定嘅案件㗎。

162
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,990
對，是，otherwise。

163
00:38:48,120 --> 00:39:08,130
係OK，跟住咧就係第五條規則。請你等等。係，sorry。請講。係多謝主席。即就住第四條咧，我哋都頭先提告去信政府當局嘅文件入邊咧，都有一個相關嘅提問啊。主席第四條第一款咧，就係提到如果競爭條例同埋而家呢一個審裁處規則就住某一個事宜冇一個特定嘅條文嘅話。

164
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:28,140
咧就高等法院規則咧就會適用啦。咁調翻轉講咧，主席，我哋嘅問題就係話，如果我哋呢一套嘅規則同埋高等法院規則就同一件事都有條文嘅話咧，咁嗰個政策原意係咪就係我哋而家呢一套審裁處規則就會係有凌駕性，即係話係會prevail咧？咁其實主席，誒政府當局。

165
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:48,150
就住我呢一個提問咧，就有一個詳細嘅書面嘅解釋，亦都有一啲例子咧，去説明即係佢哋點樣去演繹呢個條文嘅噉。或者睇下盧凡張女士可唔可以即係同議員去解釋一下呢方面？唔該，謝謝張女士。係唔該。誒，其實簡單地嚟講咧，如果喺審裁處嘅規則裏邊見到有條文嘅話咧，佢哋就會誒即係剔就。

166
00:39:48,150 --> 00:40:08,160
佢會prevent over，即係話誒。通常我哋係因為有需要先會寫入嚟呢個規則裏邊，所以同一件事情，如果呢度又有而高院規則又有嘅話咧，一般情況下就係會喺呢一個審裁處嘅規則咧，就係會誒為主導。不過有兩個細化㗎，就係文件我哋誒畀誒議員嘅文件第九段咧，就係噉樣嘅。因為有時候咧，我哋第一個類別。

167
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:28,170
咧就叫做partial application，即係話有時咧有一啲嘅高遠嘅規則咧係部分地即係需要再使用翻嘅。咁為咗唔想有任何嘅即係唔清楚咧，我哋會喺而家呢一個審裁處嘅規則裏邊係寫明㗎。譬如入邊有啲嘅例子咧，譬如我哋睇翻可能有議員有興趣去睇翻第十六條規則咧，我哋會講明喺個規。

168
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:48,180
規則裏邊講明話邊一個嘅誒邊一個誒誒高院規則嘅邊一個命令咧，係仍然會喺呢一度係誒適用定係唔適用噉樣㗎，噉就變咗咧係一個即係我哋唔想有任何嘅唔清晰，咁誒我哋呢個嘅做法咧就係希望能夠咧減少抄，即係喺個高院規則抄啲條文過嚟，但係。

169
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:55,000
亦都能夠令到我哋有彈性啦，可以引入一啲非正式嘅一啲嘅成分，同埋可以簡化簡化一啲嘅工具噉樣嘅。

170
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,690
O.K. 明白，清楚。

171
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:17,980
多唔多呢啲噉樣嘅情況，就係兩邊可能誒嗰個誒條例有衝突嘅地方，定係或者重疊嘅地方？其實所有誒有唔同嘅地方咧，就已經寫在喺呢個規則裏邊。唔寫嘅係好多嘅，即係即係誒高院規則係可以照一般噉樣認。

172
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,980
用咧係多過我哋寫出嚟喺呢個規則嘅裏邊嘅嚇。

173
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,740
請繼續。係，咁跟住落嚟咧，我哋就去到第五條嘅規則啦。

174
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:38,570
第五條嘅規則咧，就係説明一般嚟講咧，審裁處咧係可以主動噉樣行使佢嘅權力，亦都可以因應嘅申請咧而係行使佢嘅權力嘅。

175
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:50,410
係跟住落嚟咧，就係第六條。第六條就説明係一般而言咧，除非審裁處另作指示，否則如果唔遵從規則咧，係唔會令到法律程序係無效嘅。

176
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,740
係，跟住落去第七條，第七條咧就係係誒。

177
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:06,200
第七條咧就係説明啊，除咗誒本規則另有規定之外咧，展開法律程序嘅一般方式咧，係使用表格一。

178
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:21,960
O.K.第八條啦，第八條咧係提出誒一啲非正審申請interlocutory application嘅程序啦，就係要用表格二嘅傳票，同埋咧向其他嘅訴訟方咧係要送達傳票。

179
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,160
跟住係第九條，第係。

180
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:57,420
O.K.嚇。O.K.好，跟住係第九條。第九條咧係賦予誒審裁處咧係準喺某啲嘅情況之下咧係將案件係合併㗎。呢個上次我哋都有詳細傾過㗎。例如案件出現嘅事實同埋法律嘅問題係相同啦，我哋希望噉樣係有可以有助係減呢個仲費嘅。

181
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,740
O.K.

182
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:09,400
跟住啦，係第十條係關有關表格㗎，就係説明咧表格可以係按需要係作出更改，係提供彈性嘅。

183
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:22,500
跟住落嚟咧，係去到誒第二部分有關送達啦。第十一條，第十一條咧係規定咧，需喺呢個送交存檔嘅首份文文件裏邊咧，係提供一個所謂送達嘅地址。

184
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:33,590
O.K.跟住第十二條咧，係説明咧，將文件傳檔一方咧，需要向其他有關嘅方面咧，係送達有關嘅文件㗎。

185
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,030
係。

186
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:51,160
第十三條咧係有關送達一啲所謂原數文件（original document）嘅方法，例如係要面交啦、掛號郵遞等等，同埋送達生效嘅時間。

187
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,490
O.K.

188
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:12,890
第十四條係説明咧，高院規則第六。等等，法律顧問。Sorry，係對住即係就住第十三條嘅規則咧，有兩點。第一點就即係比較誒簡單啲，就係中文本嗰度咧。第十三條嘅第三款咧，似乎第一句就即係誒用咗一個粗體嘅字體噉，或者即係到時正式誒刊憲嘅時候需要去執翻啦。

189
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:32,900
就住第二點咧，主席第十三條嘅第八款咧，嗯，我哋都去信咗政府當局咧去作出嘅澄清嘅。主席就係就住呢一個英文叫做substitute service嘅誒問題咧，噉我哋嗰個提問就係話，其實如果相關嘅人士佢希望去即係發誒審裁處。

190
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:52,910
作出呢一個命令嘅時候咧，係咪需要經過一個申請咧？咁申請嗰個程序又會係點咧？係咪需要即係提交個誓章去支持相關嘅申請等等咧？咁呢一啲嘅誒程序咧，似乎而家喺呢一個條文入邊咧就冇一個好詳細嘅誒寫法喺度嘅。噉我亦都查詢過咧，咁會唔會就係高院規則？

191
00:44:52,910 --> 00:45:12,920
入邊相關嘅命令就係第六十五號命令會係適用咧，咁但係政府當局嗰個回覆咧又話誒第六十五號命令咧就不適用嘅，咁所以咧就似乎喺呢一度嗰個申請嗰個程序究竟會係點咧？咁或者張女士可唔可以同員去解釋一下？張女士係誒，正如我哋喺回應嘅文件第十三段度。

192
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:32,930
提出啦，呢一個嘅申請咧係需要誒，即係係需要先申請嘅。而申請嘅時候咧係亦都要有有啲細章咧作為一個支持㗎。咁至於點解高院條例頭先即係法律顧問call嗰個誒命令六十五同埋誒即係規則四係唔適用咧？因為嗰個誒命令咧係畀一啲非嘅誒元素文。

193
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:52,940
文件嘅噉，所以係唔會適用㗎。不過，我哋考慮到咧，啊法律顧問即係亦都提出咧，係咪喺呢一個誒十rule八裏邊唔夠清楚咧有關嘅工序？噉我哋亦都可以考慮咧，將呢一個有關嘅程序，即係講翻係用一個申請同埋需要咧用細張呢個模式咧，係可以將呢個誒rule八呢個即係將呢啲嘅成分咧。

194
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,480
可以擺翻喺個rup誒十rupa裏邊嘅。

195
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:16,980
但係而家第八段嗰度個做法就係每一次如果需要substitute service咧，誒，你係咪即係期望其中一誒嗰個元素一方就會係向法庭申請，跟住攞咗指示，跟住漸誒去跟住個指示去做？係就唔係好似平時一般打官司噉樣有一個記。

196
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:36,990
定嘅程序喺度點做？誒，我哋嘅理解，高院都係首先要提出申請，誒跟住畀個法庭誒，即係同意定係唔同意，或者同意係用咩所謂唔同嘅方式去做呢個送達咧，先至得嘅。咁所我其實我哋嘅原意係跟翻高院嘅安排一樣嘅，不過可能喺即係法律嘅條文上面，似乎未夠清晰咁解嘅啫。噉我哋。

197
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,070
係覺得如果係需要可以係再清晰化少少個條文嘅。

198
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,220
係。

199
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,260
噉啊，張女士，你翻去諗一啲點可以點樣寫得清楚啲，再清楚少少，係啦。

200
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,440
請繼續。係啦，跟住落去咧，係而家我哋去到第十四條啦。

201
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:07,440
第十四條係有關呢一個係誒説明咧，係高院規則第六十五號命令咧，係適用於其他即係唔係原訴文件嘅一啲文件嘅送達嘅。

202
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,150
係。

203
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:18,060
跟住係第十五條咧，就係説明咧審裁處係發出通知嘅方法，譬如咧係用一啲普通嘅郵遞啊噉樣。

204
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,140
okay。

205
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:44,410
跟住第十六條咧，就係説明咧喺審裁處嘅許可之下咧，係可以將文件咧送達到去呢一個即係我哋香港呢一個司法管轄權範圍之外嘅地方。

206
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,120
O.K.

207
00:47:47,200 --> 00:48:02,610
跟住係第十七條啦，第十七條係説明咧，被送達方係無需認收該文件嘅送達，或者係發出誒以抗辯通知書。呢個做法係希望精簡程序，呢個係同高院嘅規則係唔同嘅。

208
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,760
OK。

209
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:12,350
第十八條係關於原數文件嘅期限同埋續期，文件送交存檔日起計咧，一般有效期咧係六個月。

210
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,460
係。

211
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,470
誒，如果O.K.嘅，跟住我哋就係第十九條啦。

212
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:44,880
第十九條咧就係指明，第一就司法常務官咧可以就某一啲對其他人士可能有影響嘅法律程序咧，係需要發布通知，畀有充分利害關係嘅人咧係可以申請去介入。而第二咧就係通知咧係需要列明嘅啲咩嘅資料咧，都係開列喺呢個有關嘅規則裏邊嘅。

213
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:04,970
係，跟住係第二十條。二十條咧就係關於競委會以外而有充分利害關係嘅人嘅申請誒加入。

214
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:20,330
許可一個嘅程序㗎，審裁處咧可以邀請各方提交證據，以及咧作出呢個申述。如果審裁處批予許可嘅話咧，申請人就會成為介入者，而審裁處咧可以就介入者嘅參與嘅範圍咧係作出指示。

215
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,130
OK。

216
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,970
係，咁問有冇咩資格嘅要？

217
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:35,300
資格上，即係點樣可以成為即係有資格去介入？總之，佢想就得㗎啦，定係有冇一個即係誒？

218
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:55,710
有冇即係任何人都係可以成為教，即係可以申請成為加入者嘅係嘛？冇qualification。係誒，多謝議員嘅提問。我哋喺呢一度咧係講到咧嗰個嗰個有關嘅人咧係需要喺嗰件事裏誒喺嗰個嘅法律程序咧係有一個嘅誒叫做sufficient interest嘅。

219
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:15,720
係話佢有一個充分嘅利害關係，即係簡單嚟講咧，我哋法庭咧係會考慮咧嗰個提出介入嘅人咧係咪同而家處理緊個案件咧係會一個實質嘅關係。譬如上一次我哋舉一個例子，譬如話經委會而家可能係起訴緊一間超級市場A，噉佢可能咧即係誒。

220
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:35,730
話超級市場A做緊一啲嘅嘢咧，係可能係一個反競爭嘅行為。噉我哋我哋有理由相信，可能咧隔離一啲嘅超級市場B啦，或者超級市場C咧，佢哋可能都做緊呢啲同樣嘅嘢㗎。噉佢哋可能就住呢個嘅案件咧，係有一個所謂充分嘅利害關係，因為咧佢哋可能咧即係呢個我哋即係誒想象嘅啫，會唔會佢哋誒？

221
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:52,790
當呢一個誒超市場A畀人判斷係誒違反競爭法嘅時候，咁會唔會超市場B同埋C都可能會受到影響咧？咁咁呢個咧，我哋相信日後咧係有實際個案嘅時候，喺普通法下邊咧就會一路係發展誒咩叫做有充分嘅利害關係嘅人嘅。個立法原意係。

222
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,080
即係。

223
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,720
譬如話嗰啲，譬如你政府係用球星入市場嘅例子咁先算啦。

224
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,180
咁誒？

225
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:13,440
一般嘅市民，一般嘅誒私有市場嘅使用者，或者嗰度嘅使用嗰間私有市場嘅使用者，咁算唔算有個充分嘅利益利害關係？

226
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,630
誒主席，佢係客，佢係純粹係一個即係consumer，一個即係消費者嚇，咁點？

227
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:40,920
係。誒主席，我哋喺誒呢個用語，即係誒喺呢一個條文十九誒嘅主要裏邊講出呢個充分嘅利害關係嘅人，呢個字眼咧喺法律上面有好多個地方都用過嘅。咁呢個亦都需要咧誒喺普通法下邊咧一路係去發展㗎。不過我哋相信咧，因為誒即係誒我哋好難喺呢度有一個好硬嘅，因為每

228
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:59,220
每一個個案嘅情況都唔同啦，要睇翻第時嗰啲case咯點樣發展。不過我哋並冇排除咧，即係所謂一個所謂嘅消費者咧，係係咪一個即係有冇可能成為一個有利害關係人咧？我哋係並冇喺法律上邊咧，而家係排除呢個可能性嘅。嗱，我見到你知嗰度咧，就其實冇乜解釋嘅啫喎。

229
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:06,450
即係十九支係咪？十九二支係嘛？就係嗰嗰度嘅啫，係嘛？係，其中一個我哋有講呢樣嘢嘅。

230
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,670
佢淨係計嗰啲日噉嘅啫喎，冇講。

231
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,800
即係你立法嘅原意係。

232
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:25,630
係咩人用？頭先個例子咩人係即係當然啦！你話啊，等到等法官噉樣樣，噉你立法嘅時候，你都有個目標㗎。嗰啲係譬如，為止你包定唔包咧？

233
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:37,810
誒，如果真係需要，或者我請律政處嘅同事講一講咧，係現行裏邊咧，其實sufficient interest即係有充分利害關係咧，喺現時法庭嘅演繹係點樣嘅？

234
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,130
係。

235
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,940
關先生，啊！

236
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,440
主席。

237
00:52:47,760 --> 00:53:07,770
誒或者我解釋一下嗰個誒sufficient interest，因為其實呢個呢個嘅用詞咧，其實係一個比較係誒寬鬆嘅一個用詞嚟嘅。咁其實係好難去落一個嘅定義，因為呢個係視乎當時嗰個嘅誒情況會係點樣樣喺過往嘅案例裏邊，譬如喺一啲。

238
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:15,310
司法複核嘅誒案件裏邊嘅時候咧，都曾經係誒法庭咧，就係誒去誒。

239
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:29,380
判定某一啲人係有一個嘅誒sufficient interest，所以佢可以係成為誒訴訟嘅一方。咁但係究竟係咪有一個嘅所謂嘅誒確實嘅一個嘅誒definition一個嘅誒？

240
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:49,710
誒即係誒解釋咧，咁咁呢個係冇嘅。噉我哋只係可以從嗰啲嘅案例裏邊咧，我哋可以得到一啲嘅誒參考嘅價值喺當中嚇。咁但係就冇一個嘅誒實質嘅定義，邊啲人係可以有一個嘅誒誒sufficient interest一個即係誒實際嘅誒利益啊？定

241
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:58,370
啊，噉樣嚇。噉我想問其他啲誒，即係有競爭法嘅國家裏邊咧，佢哋我相信都有呢啲所謂介入者嗰個。

242
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,670
嘅做法，佢哋一般係用，即係佢嗰個所謂個門檻啊。

243
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,560
加入個門檻係用咩嘅字眼㗎？

244
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:18,480
有冇其他司法管轄區可以參考？誒，主席，我即時冇手頭有關嘅資料，我諗我哋要翻去做一做研究先至得。

245
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:39,870
不過我瞭解頭先啊關先生講嗰個觀點咧，就係即係譬如喺司法複核嘅案件裏邊咧，法庭係會就住嗰個案件本身嘅背景同埋啊啊範圍咧，去決定究竟一個人有冇啊足夠嘅啊啊啊理據咧，去參與嗰個案件咯嚇。噉啊，但係。

246
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:59,880
係即係頭先，張女士都講就係呢一方面，我哋喺香港作為一個司法管轄區咧，暫時未有案例可以去啊釐清究竟一個人係咩情況先可可以介入噉，就係要有待慢慢個法庭有案件嘅時候。我知啊，我知啊，但係但係我哋立法係咪應該等個法庭去決定，定係我哋都有個立法嘅權意逼？

247
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,190
即係我哋畫個圈係幾大，我哋應該有個諗法㗎嘛，係嘛？

248
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:11,310
唔係畀個法庭去決定曬㗎，即係當然，即係司法獨立。咁但係問題就係我哋，喂，我哋應該有個圈，個圈係。

249
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:27,310
即係到時，喂，我哋個圈畫得太大或者太細，到時我哋認為，即係作為立法者認為個法庭係覺得太大嘅，噉我哋又畫翻細佢，或者我哋覺得嘢太細㗎，我哋畫翻大佢。咁但係而家我哋都冇譜喎，呢個大定細我都唔知㗎喎。嗯。

250
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:48,120
主席，正如我哋喺回應呢一條問題嘅誒文件裏邊第十九段咧，係提出咧，即係當然啦。我哋都希望留有彈性，畀法官喺唔同嘅情況之下，能夠去判斷邊一啲叫做有充分利害關係嘅人。但係我哋而家初步去睇咧，我哋嘅諗法咧就係話咧，應該係一啲人咧呢個嘅利害關係咧係directly。

251
00:55:48,120 --> 00:56:08,130
related或connected with the subject matter of an action or application，即係話嗰個人提出嘅誒申訴或者提出嘅理據咧，係佢係應該同而家處理緊嗰個案件咧係一個直接有關係嘅嘅一個嘅噉樣嘅情況下邊嘅。咁呢個就係我哋一個誒一個起始嘅一個嘅一個所謂嘅。我知啊，咁但係都。

252
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:16,260
都即係如果嗰個解釋一般嘅法官嘅解釋，如果我係嗰度嘅消費者，咁算唔算一個直接嘅打即係嘅關係咧？

253
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,730
即係我，我覺得呢個唔係呢個一個。

254
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,730
Common sense嘅question嚟嘅啫喎。

255
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,920
唔係一個所謂rocky science嘅question。

256
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:31,190
咁如果都答唔到，我覺得咁個嗰個寫法係咪可以清晰啲寫到就係，喂呢個係。

257
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:52,520
或者咁啦，張律師誒，即係你聽到善議員嘅意見咧，或者你參考下其他誒有公平競爭法嘅一啲司法管轄區，佢哋嗰個寫法係點樣？有冇可以寫得清楚啲，或者係可以誒解答到頭先善議員提出嗰啲疑點嚇嗰個憂慮？好啊，或者都好，就或者我再重申，因為其實。

258
00:56:52,520 --> 00:57:12,530
我哋係並冇排除消費者嘅可能性㗎。不過，我知啊，咁但係你要答到嗱。你問我，我就覺得，如果消費者都冇得去介入咧，即係如果佢想嚇，噉我覺得呢個圈係太細，即係我嘅主觀意見就噉。但係你答唔到我，到時個法官話咧，誒佢佢唔等使嘅噉樣，噉我覺得個圈係太大太細啦。

259
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:27,200
係啦，嗯，明白。即係我我我我表評我立場先啦。可能有同事唔同意嘅，所謂者唔關事㗎。咁咁都唔出奇。但係即係，即係起碼我有我嘅睇法。我覺得係係咪應該有個有個寫法？咩人可以去介入咧？呢個我諗係。

260
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,500
即係唔唔係程序咁簡單咯。我諗係立法個本質個嗰個原意嘅問題嚟嘅。

261
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:53,790
法律顧問，你有補充？誒，多謝主席。咁誒，正如頭先張女士所講啦，咁亦都即係有議員提議，即係或者政府當局可以翻去即係睇一睇誒其他嘅司法管轄區會唔會都有類似嘅條文咧，係都係用到sufficient interest呢一個用詞咯。咁如果我即刻現時睇咧，就其實誒主席，政府當局之前提交畀誒委員會。

262
00:57:53,790 --> 00:58:13,800
會睇嘅文件咧，就其中有一份叫做《Competition Appeal Tribunal Rules 2003》咧。咁但係當中嗰個情況有啲唔同，嗰個就講緊喺上訴嘅時候咧有一個介入嘅程序。咁當中第十六條咧提到，即係如果有人係有一個sufficient interest啦，英文都係即係可以申請去介入嘅。咁所以或者即係政府。

263
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:33,810
當我可以翻去研究一下外國會唔會有其他類似嘅條文，都有相關嘅用詞，同埋喺外國會唔會都已經有一啲案例去演譯？究竟即係sufficient interest喺相關嘅條文底下，即係就住競爭法嗰個範圍底下，會係法庭點樣演譯咧？提供啲資料畀議員作為參考咯。係好噉樣會有助我哋去。

264
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,810
去啊！即係答到啊，善宇員頭先提出嗰啲幾點憂慮。

265
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:55,410
誒，多謝主席。或者我再有個好細嘅補充咧，就係呢一個充分利害關係呢個字眼咧，其實喺競爭條例嘅主體法例第八十五條都係已經提出㗎。不過我即係我理解到議員嘅關注，我哋翻嚟再睇睇其他國家嗰度咧，我哋再一評去考慮有關嘅建議。

266
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,140
好啊，或者下次開會嘅時候，我哋再翻返嚟呢度。

267
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:16,310
O.K. 如果冇其他委員有問題，我哋繼續啊。係，我哋跟住咧就係誒第二十一條啦。第二十一條咧係關於競委會介入嘅申請嘅程序，佢哋咧係同其他申請介入嘅人嘅程序係相若嘅。

268
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:31,770
跟住係廿二條啦，廿二條咧就係説明審裁處可以準許其他人咧係加入法律程序成為額外嘅一方，或者係取代法律程序嘅任何一方。

269
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,930
係。

270
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,680
個我唔明嘅。

271
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,230
就就得啦，咩叫？

272
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,420
可唔可以解釋清楚？

273
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,570
可唔可以解釋下？誒，或者請律政司嘅同事。

274
00:59:45,840 --> 01:00:05,850
誒介入嘅意思嘅時候，就係話，即係你原先你唔係嗰個嘅訴訟嘅一方，咁但係你覺得嗰個案件嘅誒決定或者係誒有關嘅情況可能會影響到你嘅誒利益嘅時候，噉你就會申請嚟到去介入嗰個訴訟。我知呢個我明取代，我主要問取代。

275
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,750
誒。

276
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,600
所以取代。

277
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,530
We please.

278
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,300
揾邊度啊？Substitute part。

279
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,300
或者係話誒取代嘅意思嘅時候，就話如果你覺得誒有另外一方嘅時候，佢嗰個嘅誒。

280
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:38,560
可能係未必咁適當嘅時候咧，噉你去向法院嘅時候嚟到去睇下可唔可以去取代佢成為嗰個訴訟嘅一方，啊！

281
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,510
主席啊，我我我真係算我比較唔係呢個法律背景。

282
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:51,950
我本來係原眾人告緊人，突然之間畀人取代咗我，即係我唔係作一個原眾人。

283
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,410
呢個係咪？

284
01:00:53,690 --> 01:01:13,700
我我相信佢嗰個意思唔係噉樣，或者你再我個意思嘅時候話取代另外一方嘅時候，時候就係話可能有一有一方嘅時候，佢嘅誒身份已經有轉。譬如話舉一個例子嘅時候，就話佢原先係誒嗰個嘅訴訟嘅一方，咁但係可能佢已經即係身故咗嘅時候，噉佢會。

285
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:24,140
會係有另外一個代表人嚟到去代表佢，咁所以喺噉樣嘅情況嘅時候咧，就佢要向法院嚟到去申請成為嗰個訴訟嘅一方。

286
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:34,270
嚇，就唔係話因為你你係原先嗰個一個訴訟人，我覺得你唔適合我嚟到去申請嚟到去取代你，唔係一個噉樣嘅意思。

287
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,890
而係可能嗰個人，佢本身嘅身份又變。

288
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:48,300
呢個呢台嗰啲噉係咪係咪常見打官司嘅程序嚟㗎？由被取代呢樣嘢。

289
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,020
誒呢個唔係一個好常見嘅嘢嚟嘅。

290
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:59,910
但係有㗎嘛？本身本身係有嘅，嚇，但係就唔係一個好常見嘅情況。點解唔常見？我哋喺呢一度有個理由要去加入去咧。

291
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:16,510
誒，因為我相信嘅時候係加咗落去嘅時候，就係話誒，去即係如果有一啲噉樣嘅情況去出現嘅時候，都可以嚟到去喺個法例裏邊去揾到誒理據嚟到去支持嚇。

292
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,260
O.K.我都唔係好O.K.嘅，坦白講句，即係如果呢啲係，

293
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:31,430
呢啲係成個即係普通法或者係啲所謂民事訴訟裏邊常有嘅嘢。

294
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:39,710
都可以做嘅，噉係咪喺呢個規例裏邊都需要加落去咧？

295
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:44,700
係咪其他冇呢啲規例嗰啲就唔冇呢一個權嘅咧？

296
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:52,870
我諗係有一個噉樣嘅法例喺當中嘅時候，係令到嘅條文係更加嘅清晰嚇。

297
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:15,640
但係呢個唔肯，我最後問個問題係唔會唔會出現嘅情況，一定唔會出現嘅情況就係，即係我係原眾人畀人哋取代咗，變成唔係原眾人嘅，一定唔會個。

298
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:38,360
以我理解應該唔會啦。不過誒，我想像唔到有啲噉樣嘅情況，應該就唔會嘅嚇。即係你可以，譬如你話誒有一個人係誒，我覺得佢未必係咁適合嘅時候，我唔可以去申請嚟去取代佢，但係你可以去申請加入。所以呢個條文裏邊亦都有話係。

299
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:58,420
誒，in addition to，咪加入我完全冇問題啊！即係加入我完全冇問題，我淨係採取代嗰個。取代嗰個，取代嗰個，我點解有憂慮咧？我解釋個憂慮就係點咧？我本來有啲，我本來嗰個人係有有有一定嘅權咁先算啦。我畀人取代咗，咪好似佢冇一啲權咁咯。咁咩人可以取代佢咧？噉樣樣，點解佢？

300
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,100
可以，即係點解法例賦權畀佢取代第啲人咧？

301
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:21,700
即係嗰個取代，好似我剛才所講嘅時候，佢好多時發生喺一啲，譬如有個人已經身故咗嘅時候，佢有另外一啲嘅誒代表人嚟到去去誒處理佢即係身後嗰啲事，包括一啲嘅訴訟嘅時候嗰啲嘅情況。係因為你嗱，我我又唔係想規範你，即係如果你話嗰個即係嗰。

302
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:39,170
個嗰個其中一個一方，佢已經唔能夠履行到佢嘅權力等等，所以要揾人去取代。即係嗰個ride嗰即係嗰個嗰個嗰個預設條件係咁咧，噉我就明喎。但係呢一個冇一個噉嘅預設條件喺度嘅時候咧，噉我做做下又無啦啦噉嘅樣畀人哋。

303
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,180
畀人哋取代咗。

304
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:58,050
我諗相信唔係噉樣嘅情況，而係即係當你要話去去申請嚟到去取代另外一個人嘅時候咧，你要有足夠嘅理據或者去支持你點解可以嚟到去取代另外一方咧噉樣嚇。

305
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,370
我先。

306
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,140
O.K.啊，啊，再冇嘢補充。

307
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:29,530
因為如果我想講，其實喺高院規則裏邊咧，第十五號嘅命令咧第七條嘅規則都有講啲類似就係點樣，因為身故嘅原因咧係要改更改嗰個有關嘅人噉，所以呢個其實係誒同而家袁仲庭嘅做法。我我明嘅嗱呢，即係呢個正正係我憂慮喺度。如果高院一啲民事訴訟，

308
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:35,790
嘅規則已經有嘅，一般有嘅規則啦。即係如果我冇呢一條咧，即係冇廿二呢一段咧。

309
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,090
我相信頭先嗰個規則咧，就會。

310
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:48,170
我相信啊，頭先你你你引述嗰個規則就會誒誒引用喺呢啲冇被包，即係冇條文包納包攬嘅程序下面。

311
01:05:48,450 --> 01:06:01,140
嚇！咁但係加呢條落去咧，就會係咪有個取代性嗰個啦？因為你你你你你係即係點啊？你取代咗頭先你引述嗰個㗎啦嘛，嗰個就有啊嗰個咩新股啊個原因喺度。

312
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:18,540
誒，多謝議員提問。其實唔需要擔心，因為係我哋第二十二嘅規則嘅十rule二裏邊咧，就係講明頭先我頭先我講引述嘅第十五號命令咧係適用嘅。所以頭先我講嗰啲即係身故或者其他嘅理由咧，都係會喺呢一度照常噉樣應用翻過嚟嘅。咁嗱，咁第二嗰個。

313
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:22,750
即係都係啦，嗱，咁有有有咗第二，點解仲要有第一咧？

314
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:44,140
第一嗰個主要嘅加入咧，係希望澄清咧誒加入者同埋呢一個誒喺呢個其他額外一方嘅嘅關係㗎，因為我哋喺草擬法例嘅時候咧，誒律政司畀我哋嘅意見，因為我哋有誒規則廿一同埋二十，就好容易會撈亂呢個二十二中間嘅關係。噉我哋用誒呢個十rule。

315
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:49,460
一即係廿二嘅一咧，係要釐清二十、廿一同埋廿二嘅關係嘅啫，其實。

316
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,600
明白。

317
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:01,340
係咪經？即係我唔知道係咪原本嘅原意就係。

318
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:15,300
一個普通人去告，跟住咧就競委會去介入，就法庭咧就話聽啊競委會勁啲啦，噉啊揾競委會取代嗰嗰個最初告嗰個人，係咪噉嘅意思啊？唔係定係其他意思啊？

319
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:26,600
你畀個例子嚟，因為你因為你話你嗰個廿二啊，釐清二十廿一，我仲更加亂添。即係你畀畀個例子嚟，譬如誒，即係substitution幾時會發生？點解會發生？除咗身故之外。

320
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:36,590
因為如果你失如果你要成日引用新僱嗰個原因，就係新僱嗰個原原因應該就係誒公院規則十五號命令嗰度已經適用啦嘛，係嘛？

321
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:41,400
咁如果係適用嘅時候，即係如果係呢個原因嘅時候，噉你根本就唔需要大意啦。

322
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:42,790
好吧。

323
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:58,890
喂，除咗有啲身故嘅情況，可能另外一種嘅情況嘅時候就係話係誒，譬如你授權畀另外一啲人嚟到去繼續嗰個嘅訴訟，咁呢個可能即係亦都係即係你可以去申請嚟到去去取代某一個人。

324
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:19,180
甚至乎有一啲嘅情況嘅時候，就話嗰個人已經喪失咗佢嘅誒誒誒辦事嘅能力，即係譬如我哋所講嘅一一啲嘅時候，譬如話係有啲誒誒mentally佢唔可以再繼續去履行一啲嘅誒法律上面嘅責任嘅時候，咁可能有一啲人即係係被委派。

325
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:27,770
嚟到去去為佢去處理一啲嘢嘅時候，咁喺噉嘅情況嘅時候，亦都可能會去申請嚟到去取代原先嗰個人嘅嘅嘢。

326
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,350
我知啊，嗱。

327
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,860
我我憂慮嘅地方就係，譬如我雙方。

328
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,410
雙方喺度喺度打緊官司。

329
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:53,220
咁會唔會對方嘅人去揾人去取代我呢邊嘅人？即係由如果由我我我呢個譬如誒誒原告或被告嗰方，我自己揾人去申請去取代我自己嗰啲人咧，噉我就O K喎。但係呢度你又冇講咩人可以去取代咩人喎？

330
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:09,430
我諗喺整個過程裏邊嘅時候，係法庭有一個嘅角色喺度，佢會去審察究竟有一啲咩人去做一個噉樣嘅申請，而佢想去取代即係某一啲人嘅時候，佢有冇一個嘅理據喺當中咯？其實。

331
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,700
法庭係會有一個個角色喺裏邊咯。

332
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:25,660
咁都係問翻嗰個問題咯。我哋立法嘅原意本身係我哋而家我哋做立法嘅程序啊嘛。噉我哋係諗住呢一個個佢咩人有權去申請去取代？

333
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,620
因為嗰個所謂發球權啊，如果係嗰個。

334
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:37,500
申請者，即係佢佢佢本來被取代嗰人去去去啟動嘅咧，噉我就會比較。

335
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,650
舒服啲。

336
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:53,030
即係我啟動揾人去取代我，噉我會舒服啲，因為嗰個個意願係嚟自我嘅。但係我會唔會有啲嘅情況之下，我都不被願意嘅情況之下，畀人取代咗？我係擔心呢一個點，呢一點啫嘛。

337
01:09:53,950 --> 01:10:13,960
誒，我剛才都講法庭係一個角色喺裏邊，因為如果你要去申請去取代嘅時候，你都要即係被法庭嚟到去接納，嚟到去去去。雖然法庭係好多做咗裁，有好多裁決佢要做，但係咪我哋立法嘅時候，我哋係咪應該釐清楚咩人係有權去啟動嗰個取代？

338
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,060
個過程咯。

339
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,730
係咪需要做呢一個步驟咧？應唔應該去做呢個步驟咧？

340
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:25,450
定係你哋個立法嘅原意係覺得任何人都可以去申請去取代咧？

341
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:47,360
從一個嘅誒訴訟嘅即係觀點去睇嘅時候，其實係即係誒，任何人都可以去，即係正如你任何人，你都可以去去去去去去告任何一個人嚇。咁至於你係咪可以去告得入嘅時候，呢個就係話即係去到法庭嘅時候，法庭可能會做一個嘅去決定。

342
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:57,340
究竟你有冇噉嘅噉樣嘅誒？即係確立你嘅身份係可以去告另外一個人咧，等等呢啲，即係可能就係要由一個法庭嚟到去處理咯。

343
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:16,160
係，咁嗰個比喻係太闊喎，唔係任何人高任何人嘅問題喎。你申請成為介入者咧，你個個都可以申請。呢個唔好話個個即係有嗰個sufficient即係誒誒咩啊，充分利害關係。但係係咪我做做下嘢？

344
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,440
人哋走去取代我。

345
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,030
噉我又冇。

346
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:40,320
我有冇反對佢佢佢被取代嗰個嘅權利喺度咧？如果你留意下嗰條文咧，應該就係嗰個誒審裁處嗰個法官咧，會係處理嗰個申請咯，係誒唔會冒冒然係有人入到嚟係可以取代到另一個誒，佢一定要係向。

347
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:55,550
審裁處申請，而係審裁處就住嗰個申請，再聽曬所有誒受影響嘅一方嘅陳詞之後，去作出呢一個噉樣嘅決定咯，就唔係話誒單方面可以就噉。

348
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,980
啊！呢個我理解啱唔啱啊？

349
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,920
啱嘅，主席。

350
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:21,630
或者你睇下有冇嘢補充下一次，即係諗到阿善宇頭頭先提到嘅一啲擔憂咧。你你如果覺得有需要可以補充，可以令到佢更加放心咧。呢一方面我諗會有幫助。啊，法律顧問。

351
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:41,920
係，多謝。咁或者即係誒，當局都可以考慮一下，即係可唔可以即係提供一啲資料咧？就係即係同而家誒高等法院一般民事訴訟嘅時候相關嘅情況，即係做一個比較。譬如頭先提到嘅第十五號命令嘅第七條啦，當中就講即係如果係相關嘅誒訴訟一方係因為去世等等嘅原因。

352
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:52,790
咁需要即係取代啊等等，即係呢啲畀阿志員去作為一個參考，即係會唔會喺現時其實高等法院規則底下已經有一啲相類似嘅條文可以做一個比較咯？唔該，主席。

353
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,770
係。

354
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:57,680
可以，我哋可以考慮翻去提供相關嘅資料。

355
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,240
O.K.好，咁或者我哋下一次睇下你有冇咩補充噉樣嚇。

356
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:19,860
下一條跟住係二十三，係啦，規則二十三條咧係關於第三方同埋相類嘅法律程序一啲嘅誒公序嚟㗎，就係咧我哋係要獲得啲審裁處嘅許可咧，先至可以發出相關嘅通知書。

357
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,330
嗯。

358
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,950
OK。

359
01:13:45,840 --> 01:14:05,850
O K， O K哦，係二十四條啦。跟住二十四條咧，就係表明訴訟人咧係可以向審裁處提出申請，要求作出命令咧，係勒令任何人咧係透露關乎有關法律程序嘅文件，以及交出文件係以供查閲㗎。審裁處係會考慮一係列嘅因素，例如咧係會平衡各方。

360
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:09,920
嘅利益同埋資料嘅機密性咧，先至會作出決定嘅。

361
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,320
係。

362
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:23,940
跟住係二十五條，二十五條咧就係表明喺案件管理方面咧，審裁處係可以作出指示同埋制定有關嘅時間表。

363
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:39,160
係二十六條咧，係規定咧送達呢個所謂嘅質詢書interviews咧，係需要得到審裁處嘅誒許可嘅。係。

364
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:49,250
二十七條咧就係表示咧，審裁處可以喺認為適合嘅情況之下咧，係指示各方咧係將呢個狀書（pleadings）係送交存檔。

365
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,310
係。

366
01:14:53,430 --> 01:15:06,030
誒跟住係二十八條，就係表明咧非正審申請嘅聆訊會咧，誒聆訊咧係會喺內庭進行㗎，而其他法律嘅程序咧就係誒嘅聆訊咧就會喺公開法庭進行。

367
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,600
聽唔明。

368
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:23,150
O.K.跟住二十九條咧，就係説明審裁處嘅組成，同埋咧審裁處成員咧係可以委任一啲叫做裁判委員assessors一起進行聆訊嘅。

369
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:40,720
有冇啲情況係誒嗰個誒president同埋deputy president副庭長都係要同時出啊值去一個聆訊噉樣，定係每一個聆訊只係啊一係係庭長或者一係副庭長？

370
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:56,490
誒呢個咧係主體法例咧係有提供嘅，誒我未必即時揾得翻，即係其實係啊主席法官咧係可以決定每一次處理案件嗰個嘅組成嘅部分㗎，咁或者誒我去用後咩組合啊可以？

371
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,300
我係Mr David Grover，Can you have on this?

372
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,510
我我盡快揾翻嗰個。

373
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:09,840
啊，或者我哋睇翻咧第一百三十六條，即係啊主題條例嗰度㗎。

374
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:12,160
啊，唔係呢個。

375
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,610
唔好意思。

376
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,940
即時揾唔翻。

377
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:30,150
一四五啊！

378
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:39,270
係係冇意思，對唔住，因為一百四十五條係主體條例一百四十五條，就係有幾個可能性嘅。第一係可以由啊啊。

379
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:56,140
主任法官自己做啦。第二個咧就係由主任法官同埋主任法官委任嘅一名或者多於一名嘅其他成員啦。而第三個咧就係主任法官委任嘅一名或者係多於一名嘅其他成員。噉佢哋誒由係主任法官可以決定嘅。其他成員會係啲咩人？

380
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:16,430
誒根據，亦都係主體條例啦，就係所有而家原眾庭嘅法官都會自動咧成為咧呢個審裁處嘅成員㗎。咁所以到時咧就會因應案件嘅需要咧，係委派其他嘅原眾庭嘅法官係幫手做呢個競爭嘅誒案件。即係而家就有兩位誒原訴庭嘅法官啦，係嘛噉就係庭長同副庭長。

381
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:30,760
長嘅職位係嚇，咁而副庭長亦都可以單獨處理案件嘅，可以嘅，因為佢有第三個選擇咧，就係總之由阿主任法官去委任嘅，就唔需要次次都係由主任法官自己去負責嘅。OK，明白。請繼續。

382
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,960
跟住咧就係誒第三十條。

383
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:54,490
係呢個出庭發言權㗎。第十三條咧就係建議呢個誒律師咧喺審裁處嘅出庭發言權嘅規範咧，其實係大致上邊咧係同原進原眾庭係一致㗎。即係第一就係只有大律師同埋呢個眾辯律師可以喺公開聆訊裏邊咧出庭係發言啦。第二訴訟人可以係自己出庭㗎。第三如果係公司嘅。

384
01:17:54,490 --> 01:18:02,730
話咧，得到法庭嘅批准咧，都可以由佢嘅董事出席㗎。不過同原眾庭唔同嘅咧，就係審裁處係都可以批准咧，其他人係出席㗎。

385
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:24,050
我呢度有個問題咧，就係如果誒，你知喺香港而家有競爭法嘅律師或者大律師誒，即係喺依一方面有經驗嘅嘅法律界人士，唔係話太多噉。我預預期咧誒，第時有真係大案件嘅時候咧，可能競委會又好或者。

386
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:44,060
誒私人訴訟一方又好咧，係需要去聘請啊英國或者澳洲或者其他普通法誒管轄區嘅一啲誒資深或者御用大律師噉樣。咁嗰個程序會係點咧？就係係咪按翻而家一貫嘅程序，就係要向法庭申請去翻？

387
01:18:44,060 --> 01:19:04,070
誒呢個誒元素誒元素庭嗰度申請一個許可啊，即係特準許可一個at hoc嘅admission啦，定係可以直接去呢個競委會嗰度申請，而由競委會嗰個主審法官自己去處理噉樣，究竟需唔需要或者畀唔畀呢個誒外國嘅御用大律師去？

388
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:24,080
去代表其中一方去去打官司噉樣誒，多謝主主席嘅提問。我哋喺呢一方面咧，亦都同律大律師公會有過嘅溝通㗎。我哋嘅誒都係同意咧，係用翻一個現行嘅機制，即係話呢一啲外國嘅一啲嘅律師咧，都需要透過而家嘅at hot admission嘅工具咧，係誒先至可以進入香港嘅領域咧，係打呢啲案件嘅。

389
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:44,090
擔唔擔心？因為誒，譬如如果就住誒一啲競爭法嘅誒誒特別需要，譬如我要請英國一位御用大律師嚟，因為佢喺依一方面係有佢特別嘅專長。咁但係我嗰個申請又係翻翻去高等法院嘅原訴庭去去申請嘅喎，而聽我呢個申請嗰個法。

390
01:19:44,090 --> 01:20:04,100
官咧誒，可能唔係誒誒呢個競爭事務委員誒，呢個競爭競誒裁判處嗰個法官嚟㗎，噉佢又唔知道究竟其實喺呢一方面係咪真係需要有一個噉樣嘅專家嚟香港？咁因為佢唔係坐喺嗰個誒誒審裁處嗰個法官。

391
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:24,500
啊，應該就係正正常嚟講，就係審裁處嗰個法官咧，佢最清楚究竟啊呢一單案件需唔需要有外國嘅御用大律師嚟嚟幫手嘅，即係協助個法庭。咁其實我我擔心嘅就係你你做呢個申請，如果你照翻一貫程序做呢個申請咧，聽呢個申請個法官咧，未必會。

392
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:44,510
會清楚知道喺依一方面嗰個法律嗰個發展係咪需要啊？好多時可能佢又要將嗰個申請係咪又要掟翻翻去誒審裁處嗰個誒誒法官去聽翻啦，定點樣咧？你明唔明我嗰個明白誒？或者主席，因為呢一個係一個行政上面嘅安排咧，我哋未可能未諗得咁詳細嘅啫。我會將你嘅意見咧，翻。

393
01:20:44,510 --> 01:21:04,520
係反映，睇下點樣喺行政上面咧，儘量係誒便利有關嘅申請。最好就係即係最最直接或者最最了當嘅方法，就係直接了當嘅方法就係誒，我如果要申請啊一個御用大律師嚟香港，我就直接係去呢個審裁處嗰個誒庭長。

394
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:14,200
即係個president或者副庭長嗰度去做呢個申請，而由嗰個誒庭長或者副庭長自己去決定，究竟係唔係呢個申請係合當，係咪能夠咁做咧？

395
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:26,850
誒，我要先翻去睇下係條文上面，因為呢個係另外一條法例嘅規範嘅裏邊，因為有個誒法律執業者條例嘅，我哋睇睇有冇噉樣嘅空間可以頭先做到誒，主席你提出嘅一個噉樣嘅可能性。好啊，唔該嚇。

396
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:34,030
請繼續，誒誒謝偉俊議員，誒回應翻剛才主席個問題咧，咁而家目前呢個三十。

397
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:35,200
誒。

398
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:45,390
一B細羅馬數字二嗰度咧，嗰個容易咧，其實係咪都有個空間畀到？剛才啊，主席提所所提供嗰個問題。

399
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,460
係。

400
01:21:47,330 --> 01:22:07,340
誒，我哋嘅意思咧，誒三十嘅一杯嘅細義咧，其實喺啲其他唔係法律專業嘅人士嚟㗎。因為我哋預期有一啲其他嘅人，例如係嗰個行業嘅一啲嘅誒工會啊，或者係呢個行業一啲嘅trade association，佢可能想代表某一啲人上上庭㗎。咁所以就唔係諗住去誒cover一啲外。

401
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:21,120
外國翻嚟嘅律師嘅，係未諗住啫。咁但係如果而家睇字面咧，你會唔會覺得三十一B細義咧，都其實可以喺某程度上咧係提供到嗰個平平台畀任何人去申請？

402
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,730
係喎，呢個呢個非常之好嘅問題。

403
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:45,140
誒，我我哋即係得到嘅法律意見就係，我哋要將呢一條法例同埋呢個法律執業者條例一齊去睇嘅，噉就應該係唔會有個噉樣嘅安排出到嚟嘅。嗱，你冇答咗個問題。個問題問問你哋以往你哋有冇考慮過問題？而家怎睇嘅字面上回應翻主席嘅問題咧？

404
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:51,040
喺字面上咧，似乎就應該呢個係個空間，可以個平台做呢一樣嘢，而唔需要再有啲咩修訂。

405
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,390
誒，如果係噉，我哋可以翻去考慮一下咧，因為我哋嘅。

406
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:18,320
因為我哋喺誒三十一嘅boy嘅一咧，就已經係講明律師嗰個發言權係點樣㗎。咁所以我哋即係律政司嘅意見，即係到到誒B嘅二嘅時候咧，就講緊啲唔係法律嘅人士㗎。不過如果委員覺得呢度係有一個所謂灰色嘅地帶嘅話咧，我哋可以考慮諗下有冇。

407
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:38,330
需要再澄清少少，我哋並唔係打算利用呢個B二咧，係畀一啲外國嘅律師入嚟㗎，即係unless佢哋有。但係啊，謝議員提嗰個嗰個問題，正正就係譬如如果有御用大律師，或者有一方想聘請一個外國嘅御用大律師，佢可唔可以透過誒誒呢個第三十條規則一B二？

408
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:58,340
而嗰度向法庭申請咧，而法庭有冇權啊啊？即係嗰個競爭啊啊裁呢個審裁處能唔能夠透過呢個條款畀嗰個人去代表其中一方？誒，我哋嘅理解，因為呢個嘅B嘅二咧係要喺審裁處嘅許可之下㗎，而我哋審裁處嘅intention咧就係誒，凡係外國。

409
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:18,350
翻嚟嘅律師係必須要透過現行執業者條例嘅個admission先做到嘅，所以我哋係唔會批准嘅。咁所以即係除非個intention可能係噉樣，但係我諗可能要寫清楚究竟誒嗰個誒法例本身真係實即係實施嘅時候咧，嗰個實際運作會係點樣？我哋翻去考慮。

410
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:38,360
係有冇需要再喺呢一方面加以澄清？喺呢呢一條嘅法例裏邊，話譬譬如如果競委會本身啊，譬如如果嚇假設Mr. Monaghan佢話我我依單誒官司我係想自己代表競委會去做一個申請嘅，咁可能唔係話係即刻出庭一個正審嘅。

411
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:58,370
嘅時間可能係training hearing內庭嘅時候，我作一個申請。噉，競委會係咪可以噉樣嘅情況之下揾一個佢一個內部嘅律師一個in-house lawyer去代表競委會做一個申請，而係咪可以透過三十一B二嗰度咧，係誒攞到個許可咧？即係可可以有噉嘅情況咯。我我睇到。

412
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:12,170
明白，即係呢個係演繹嘅問題，就我哋就並唔係我哋嘅立法原意。如果係噉，我哋翻去諗下點樣再收翻緊一啲呢個誒B二嗰個位。未必係要收緊嘅，不過即係你寫清楚究竟。我話想講放鬆，主席，我哋嗰。

413
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:32,670
係啊，對唔住啊，朱生，你問完你個part，我我就可以補充問題啊。我我我明啊，即係啊，唔係一定要收緊或者放鬆，只不過係寫清楚究竟你個你個intention、你個原意係乜嘢。明。而同埋咧，係我我預期見到咧，就係其實有好多案件可能係好需要外國嘅御用大律師嘅，因為香港實在係呢個經。

414
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:52,680
競爭法嘅法律專家咧，就暫時唔係咁多。噉啊，如果真係有需要嘅話，可能要請楊大律師咧。呢個情況會，我諗會，如果一有案件發生嘅話咧，應該會幾常見到添，我覺得嚇。明白。係謝偉俊議員，主席，我個睇法啱啱就唔係話想收緊嘢，想睇下點樣可以容許。

415
01:25:52,680 --> 01:26:12,690
咧多啲人咧有方法有權利咧，用一啲更加便捷嘅，甚至係更加平便宜嘅途徑咧，係有機會揾到代表或者自己再做嚇。咁睇翻咧，除咗剛才講嘅問題之外咧，你哋而家三十一嗰度咧，誒三十一B啦嚇，仲緊過而家其他。

416
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:32,700
民事程序，因為點解咧？民事程序咧，如果唔係正審咧，我剛才主席講咧，喺所謂in chambers咧內庭聆訊咧，律師已經可以，就算無需有現時嘅所謂最高法院嘅發言權嘅律師，都可以已經可以出席代表㗎啦。但係睇翻三十一B而家目前嘅寫法咧，你哋連嗰個可能性都闊開咗。

417
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:39,980
剔除咗，噉係咪你表面上就話促促進競爭啊？但係你其實係不鼓勵競爭咧？

418
01:26:41,580 --> 01:27:01,590
誒多謝議員嘅提問。啊，頭先我哋一開始嘅時候咧，都有誒解釋過咧，誒即係呢個出庭發言權咧喺未來嘅競爭審誒事務審裁處係會等於而家原眾庭係一樣㗎。簡單嚟講，如果係內庭嘅話咧，係普通嘅事務律師都係可以誒上嚟㗎。咁而呢個而家呢個嘅寫法咧，其實我哋係參考其他相關嘅法例噉樣寫出嚟。

419
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:10,210
嘅，咁誒即係話相關嘅法例其實係唔會寫得咁詳細嘅，即係係主要講緊係一個即係誒公開聆訊嘅嗰啲嘅安排嘅。

420
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:31,850
對唔住，你可唔可以誒？或者因為我冇有機會做一個所謂誒誒cross reference，即係你可以講講出邊一條條文咧，係同呢個三十一B一齊要睇住，令到其他程序係可以好似類似內庭嘅程序咧，可以由非誒高院法官誒對唔住高院嘅有待。

421
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:35,070
有發言權嘅律師可以出席代表當事人。

422
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,570
係啊。

423
01:27:47,250 --> 01:28:07,260
我哋睇下抄唔抄到，即刻揾到公軟規則嘅一個類似嘅法則，即係或者呢個可以融合補誒，畀翻阿阿謝議員啦。即係簡單嚟講，我哋嗰個嘅誒立法嘅原意都係將誒競爭事務審裁處嗰個嘅法庭誒出庭發言權嘅安排係會等於院中庭嘅，即係我哋唔打算改變嘅。

424
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,570
嗯。

425
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,660
但係呢個，如果你我見到你嘅誒模式咧，就。

426
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,940
任何如果同啊？

427
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:36,230
誒高院嘅規例有任何偏差嘅咧，或者係誒會引用嘅咧，你都好啊好恰當，或者甚至乎不厭其煩地咧，係喺嗰度復述翻喺呢度嘅規例裏邊嘅。但係正正而家三十一B咧係冇呢個噉嘅引述嘅，咁會唔會其實係我哋有冇要唔要睇好多？

428
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,360
多嘢先揾到呢個答案出嚟咧～

429
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,480
係。

430
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:47,200
或者我哋揾翻相關嘅條文，再可以同議員討論，究竟有冇需要再寫得再清楚啲？好啊，好啊，好，唔該。

431
01:28:48,490 --> 01:29:08,500
好，如係法律顧問，係多謝。即係或者有兩點補充，即係或者誒，當局翻去考慮關於第三十條，需唔需要再進一步修訂嘅時候咧，都可以即係考慮埋。主要我留意得到咧，其實誒就住第三十條關於律師出庭發言權咧，其實同大律師公會嗰個意見咧都有啲相。

432
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:28,510
相似嘅噉，其實政府當局回覆嗰份文件就係文件編號C B顧胡四七二零斜洞一四至一五零一入邊嘅附件咧，就夾附咗同大師工會嗰個意見嗰個交流啦。咁當中第六段咧就講到呢一點嘅噉，嗯，我理解咧，其實政府當局當其時。

433
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:48,520
回應，但係施工會咧就話佢哋個政策原意咧，就正如頭先張女士所講咧，就並唔係即係用呢個方式咧取代咗一般根據誒法律職業業者條例底下嗰個申請嗰個做法嘅。咁所以佢哋誒為咗澄清呢一點咧，佢哋就會喺審裁處嗰個實務指示咧。

434
01:29:48,520 --> 01:30:08,530
Direction咧入邊就會作出一個誒誒條文相關嘅規定嘅。咁主席，如果政府當局嗰個原意係咁咧，其實可以考慮即係咪需要喺個規則度再寫清楚啲去表達佢哋嗰個原意，就唔係即係淨係用實務指實務指示咧。主席，呢個第一點。係。第二點咧就係其實亦都可能政府當

435
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:28,540
誒誒誒，司法機構翻嚟都可能需要澄清，就係如果佢哋嗰個原意係真係佢哋係需要用法律執業者條例嗰個申請嘅程序，咁又點樣同而家三十條一款B嘅羅馬二段去一拼去考慮咧？就係如果當嗰個誒相關律師已經根據法律執業者條例。

436
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:48,550
係攞咗高等法院原狀法庭嗰個許可啦。噉就住第三十條，佢仲需唔需要再進一步跟佢第一款B嘅B嘅第羅馬二段，再同審裁處再攞一個許可，即係變咗要申請兩次咧？定係點樣咧？或者即係呢個可以一並澄清？唔該，謝謝誒，多謝法律顧問嘅。

437
01:30:48,550 --> 01:31:08,560
提誒嘅提問，首先第一點咧就係，正如法律顧問都提出啦，我哋嘅願意其實已經係同有關嘅誒法律專業團體喺商討嘅時候咧，我哋已經達成共識，就係希望用一個實務指示嘅形式咧，就大家都好明白㗎。不過，如果委員係有即係我聽到，議員好似都有啲覺得唔係好清楚，所以我哋翻嚟會考慮咧，有冇需要將呢啲嘢擺。

438
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:28,570
喺個規則即係個法例裏邊，定係已經用實務指示係足夠㗎。第二嘅咧就我或者我哋再誒提出咧就係三十嘅一嘅B嘅二咧呢一個嘅條文咧，其實係我哋係有參考過其他啲咧非正式嘅程序一啲嘅法庭咧係寫出嚟㗎，例如係Labour Tribunal，即係誒即係勞工有關嘅。咁呢一個咧都係表。

439
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:45,400
講明一啲咧，唔係法律嘅專業嘅人士嘅先至適用㗎。所以法律顧問頭先提出嘅就係，如果個外國律師已經透過法律執業條例獲得個所謂at-hold admission嘅話咧，佢並唔需要咧再透過呢個三十嘅一波二咧，係再嚟申請多次㗎。係。

440
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,220
呢個都係我理解。

441
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:51,270
O K，咁如果就住第三十。

442
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:59,940
段嗰度冇其他問題啦，我哋就繼續審議三十一啊。好，唔該主席，跟住我哋係三十一條。

443
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:07,470
三十一條咧係有關咧訴訟人缺席法律程序嘅聆訊之下咧，審裁處嘅處理。

444
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,650
噉啊！

445
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,480
有可能。

446
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:24,930
請繼續。三十二條咧係有關訴訟人喺缺席、非正審申請嘅聆訊之下咧，審裁處嘅處理。

447
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:39,820
係。第十三三十三條咧，係關於聆訊進行時候嘅詳情㗎。譬如審裁處可以指示咧，係用書面嘅陳詞嚟替代各方嘅發言。OK。

448
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:45,170
三十四條咧，就係説明喺一方缺席之下咧，作出嘅裁決咧，係可以作廢。

449
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:02,590
係。

450
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:10,600
三十五條啦，第三十五條咧係説明一般而言咧，審裁處係可以按照唔同嘅方式咧去收取證據。

451
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:26,140
佢呢度有冇講話？譬如如果有啲專家證人咧，佢係需要喺外國嗰度作供嘅。

452
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:36,330
啊！呢個啊係咪三十五誒會賦予畀啊審裁處有足夠嘅權力，或者彈性去處理一啲噉樣嘅申請？

453
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:58,080
誒，如果係要誒專家證人去提出嘅誒誒所謂expert advice咧，因為我哋到時會有啲案件管理嘅誒嘅聆訊嘅，噉佢可以咧提出就由審裁處係批准。但係而家審裁處會唔會有譬如視像式嘅透過視像啊電電視或者？

454
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:18,090
啊！其他方式係去啊啊錄取正功噉樣得唔得嘅？誒，多謝主席嘅提問。正如而家一般嘅民事嘅訴訟嘅案件係高院一樣咧，我哋係按需要咧係，如果真係需要，亦都雙方同意嘅話咧，係可以透過一啲嘅所謂嘅Overseas Television Link，即係海外嘅電視聯。

455
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:33,780
係咧，係作出呢一個誒提出呢個證據嘅。噉我哋有一個實務嘅指示咧，係講解咗乜嘢嘅因素、乜嘢嘅情況下邊咧，法庭有可能係即係容許呢一種嘅做法嘅。咁誒，而家嗰個審裁處佢確實喺個地點喺邊度啊？

456
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:54,070
誒，我哋暫時呢一個，因為誒未有呢個新嘅誒法庭嘅大大樓啦。噉我哋喺譬如我哋預期今年有機會咧，我哋係全面實施有關嘅條例嘅話咧，我哋會先喺高院咧係誒，因為都係啲高院嘅法官嚟嘅。其實我哋會先喺高院咧就誒開始就做呢一個競爭嘅誒案件。到到日後如果有

457
01:34:54,070 --> 01:35:14,080
比較多多嘅空間嘅時候，我哋會再考慮有另外嘅做法。即係你，你可能要另外揾地方誒。我哋暫時就唔諗住嘅。我哋因為誒，因為佢哋都係啲高院嘅法官，所以暫時咧我哋就係採取一個比較即係融合嘅做法，就係會喺高院嘅大樓裏邊做埋一啲競爭有關嘅案件先。直到我哋有可能有新嘅地方嘅時候咧，我哋先考慮有冇即係。

458
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,900
即係可以再分開地出嚟啊，定係點樣嘅？

459
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:38,390
係謝偉俊議員。誒主席，我誒再一次就誒有啲擔心，就係我覺得我哋而家會係想話比較嚴格咁跟翻我哋高院嘅程序啊，定還是係畀好多酌情權畀有關嘅審裁處咧？而如果畀酌情權嘅時候，幾時畀幾多咧？咁因為呢個咧就關於。

460
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:58,400
畀政工方面咧，如果係跟翻我哋嚴格高院嘅規則咧，好多時乜嘢邊類申請咧，用咩方式啊，用啲咩政工啊，包括係是否可以接納書面嘅政工啊，即係細章形式嘅，會講得清清楚楚嘅。但係如果你而家噉樣寫法咧，就好似你都未決定究竟係行第一個比較緊嘅程序咧，定行住比較寬鬆嘅程序咧。

461
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,950
點樣？點樣咧？咁會唔會製造好多混亂咧？

462
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:26,890
係誒主席，或者我有個補充㗎喺呢個主體條例第一百四十七條咧，即係競爭條例嘅主體條例第一百七十四一百四十七條咧係講出咧呢個證據規則㗎，就審裁處咧其實咧係會同原眾庭嘅誒嘅喺個做呢個證據嘅安排裏邊係不一樣㗎。我哋咧係唔需要誒受到。

463
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:43,290
到呢一個證據規則嘅約束㗎，咁入邊咧就即係除咗有啲嘅例外啦，係開列在喺呢一個第一百四十七條。咁所以咧，我哋嘅因為呢一個噉樣嘅第一百四十七條咧，係所以我哋喺誒考慮收取證據嘅方式嘅時候咧，我哋係提供比較多嘅彈性嘅。

464
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:44,690
係。

465
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,610
係，誒。

466
01:36:46,890 --> 01:37:06,900
一百四十七個大嘅方向咧，當然係有可以有選擇咧。問題而家就係話，因為好多時咧，你哋如果有需要係引述翻高院嘅規例嗰陣時，邊啲用得邊部分唔用得，你哋都會講清楚嘅。但係呢一部分咧，你哋又做一個好大嘅真空咧，究竟係點樣做咧？咁當然我明白到喺草擬上可能有一定嘅困難。

467
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:26,910
因為個範圍都幾大嚇，但係會唔會係有一個或者誒簡單咁講咧？會唔會有個指向性嘅一個方式，就係話除咗誒深財處特別誒命令之外，否則嘅話咧，跟翻高院嗰個做法啦。咁咁大家就有個起碼個引指導性嘅方向先，而唔會而家咁咧。

468
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:36,860
究竟我每個申請嘅時候，我應該係咪要用啲咩證供咧？噉，定還是你留翻每一單案，由翻審裁處個別案件、個別程序、個別情況之下，每一次再決定咧？

469
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:57,870
係誒，多謝議員嘅提問。誒，我諗我哋喺誒特別係做證據呢個安排裏邊咧，係專登係同高院係有少少唔同嘅，因為高院嗰度有一個好嚴謹嘅規則，所以誒好多嘢咧就個規範咧就未必能夠完全係適用喺呢一個審裁處，所以我哋先至提出呢個規則三十五出嚟㗎。咁變咗我哋嚇。

470
01:37:58,270 --> 01:38:15,190
問問題對唔住，問題就係有時你就專登係有分別，但係另一方面你又，有時就專登係跟得足。噉你究竟係幾時先係有分別，幾時有足咧？噉我哋點樣掌點樣把握呢個或者掌握呢個噉嘅誒方向性嘅一個諗法？誒，多謝議員提。係咪每一次都要咬親死先算咧？

471
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:36,200
係咪每次都要硬生食？誒特別係就住三十五，因為我哋已經有咗大例啦，一百四十七條啦，咁亦都有呢個細例啦。咁亦都咧，我哋理解係特別係去到現實裏邊有啲實際具體嘅情況咧，可能有啲好細嘅地方都可能有出現一啲唔清楚嘅地方。所以其實我哋為咗呢一套嘅規則咧，係做咗兩套咧實務指示出嚟㗎。

472
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:49,190
亦都咧係誒徵詢咗誒有關嘅，譬如大律師公會同埋律師公會，即係話嗰啲好細節嗰啲係即係可能隨時即係都會大家有唔清楚嘅地方咧，但係一般咧，我哋法庭嘅安排咧都係透過實務指示咧作出澄清嘅。

473
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:51,510
係。

474
01:38:52,260 --> 01:39:04,560
我我我聽住咁多先咧，或者我哋再有等進再諗到有咩，你再提出好啊。唔該，請繼續。好，跟住係第三三十六條啦，係關於傳召證人嘅程序同埋相關咧開支嘅支付。

475
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:28,690
係跟住第三十七條，第三十七條係關於資料嘅機密處理，就講明咧，申訴人可以申請咧將全部或者部分嘅文件咧係列作機密㗎，亦都咧提及咧提出申請有一啲相關嘅規定，例如咧係要以書面提出。審裁處係會考慮成個案件嘅整體情況，例。

476
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:32,780
例如公眾利益同埋訴訟人嘅利益咁咧，先至會作出決定嘅。

477
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,740
係。

478
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:46,750
跟住係三十八條，三十八條係説明咧，審裁處係要按其認為合適嘅條款咧，係押後法律程序嘅聆訊。

479
01:39:50,930 --> 01:40:10,940
係三十九條咧，係容許各方就審裁處咧係作出嘅命令嘅條款咧，係達成協議。不過喺第就住第三步同埋第四步所置嘅法律程序，即係有關一啲所謂誒可複合嘅裁定同埋一啲誒執即係執行嘅一啲嘅程序裏邊咧，因為會涉及一啲公眾利益嘅考慮，所

480
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:13,430
所以必須係提交咧，係審裁處批准。

481
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:17,630
係。

482
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:28,230
跟住係第四十條，四十條就説明審裁處咧係可以勒令去剔除或者係修訂惡意中傷啦、瑣碎無聊或者係無理取鬧嘅申請或者申索㗎。

483
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:53,360
而家有啲誒誒法庭有一個規則，就係管理。如果有一啲訴訟人佢係經常去入一啲無理取鬧或者一啲誒冇誒實質理據嘅案件咧，法庭係有一個特別嘅處理方式。呢個係適唔適用於？

484
01:40:53,720 --> 01:41:13,730
敬畏誒競爭事審裁處誒，其實誒主席提出嗰個咧，就應該係呢個高院規則第十八號命令同埋第十九條規則。其實我哋咧就誒考慮過嘅，因為咧誒可以唔寫喺呢個審裁處，就完全將嗰個嘅命令咧係喺度生效。不過我哋覺得呢個事。

485
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:33,740
事情非常之重要，因為無理取鬧或者呢啲嘅案件，我哋點樣能夠剔除咧？係一個重要嘅權力。噉我哋都參謀咗其他嘅法庭，例如係誒勞資審裁處同埋呢一個小額欠債嘅法例咧，佢都有寫明呢一條嘅條例。咁所以咧，我哋就係誒寫入嚟呢一條嘅法例，就係誒會即係將嗰個誒頭先我講高院規則嘅。

486
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,070
精神咧，就已經喺呢度應用到㗎啦。

487
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,060
okay。

488
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,390
OK。

489
01:41:44,240 --> 01:42:04,250
跟住落嚟係第四十一條，第四十一條係表明司法常務官咧係有權處理咧由審裁處成員係內庭處理嘅所有嘅事務，並且係有權咧行使咧係由審裁處成員咧係內庭行使嘅所有權力同埋司法管轄權㗎。但係咧，司法常務官亦都可以咧將申請係押後，係由審裁處嘅成員咧。

490
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:05,330
進行聆訊。

491
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:09,960
係。

492
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:22,520
跟住係誒四十二條，四十二條係針對咧誒係關於咧針對司法常務官呢啲非正審嘅決定咧，係可以向審裁處嘅成員提出上訴嘅有關程序。

493
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:40,240
即係佢常務官作咗個決定，咁如果上訴嘅話，就直接去嗰個審裁處嘅主審法官。誒，唔係唔一定主審法官係法官。法官係啦，即係可以係庭長或者副庭長。係啦，係啦。咁同而家高院其實安排都係一樣。係。

494
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:55,160
跟住係四十三條，四十三條係都係針對咧司法常務官嘅決定，係呢一啲嘅決定咧係會向上訴法庭提出上訴嘅有關嘅程序㗎。因為呢啲牽涉嘅決定係比較屬於係我哋所謂一個所謂終極嘅性質嘅一啲嘅誒決定。

495
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:16,130
係，跟住係四十四條係講咧，説明邊一啲咧係可以按住條誒主體條例第一百五十五括弧二條所指出嘅非正審嘅命令裁定或者命令，讓呢個訴訟人可以以當然嘅權利咧，係直接向上訴法庭提出上訴。

496
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,280
係。

497
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:43,620
跟住係四十五條，四十五條係有關針對誒審裁處成員所作一啲非正審。請你等等啊，法律顧問係就住第四十四段有一個係，唔好意思，朱誒第四十四條咧，我哋都去上一次政府當局去澄清一點嘅，就係四十四條嘅第二款嘅G段咧，英文就有一。

498
01:43:43,620 --> 01:44:03,630
個誒法律嘅用語叫unless order嘅噉，主席呢一個即係對於法律界嚟講，就即係係人都知其實講緊係一個咩嘅用語啦。咁但係可能對於普通市民睇法例嘅時候咧，就未必知道乜嘢叫做係英文unless order嘅。中文係咁誒，主席中文咧就叫做一項限時履行的命令噉，我。

499
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:23,640
都做咗一個簡單研究咧，似乎呢一個誒at least order呢個寫法咧，喺其他法律條文入邊咧，都好似冇即係直接喺條文用呢一個用詞嘅。咁所以主席即係有兩點就係，即係政府當局可唔可以翻去研究下，即係誒其他條文係咪都冇用類似嘅用語咧，同埋係咪需要即係為咗能夠即係方。

500
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:43,650
方便人哋理解究竟乜嘢先至叫做一個unless order，係咪需要即係有一個定義咧？唔該，主席。係係誒，多謝法律顧問嘅提問。正如我哋喺回應啊，畀議員嘅文件第二十三段同埋二十四段咧，係指出誒，即係我哋詳細解釋咗咩叫做一個限時未履行嘅命令啦。我誒其實咧呢一啲噉樣嘅命令咧，係而家係經常咧係。

501
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:52,580
袁仲庭咧係啊由法官係作出㗎，噉啊我哋亦都有個實務嘅指示咧，係由我哋司法機構咧係即係講明咧邊一咩嘢叫做一個unless order㗎。

502
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,110
係。

503
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:17,190
O K，咁有冇需要再寫喺法例度？即係我哋唔係好，即係覺得未必有噉嘅需要。法律顧問係主誒主席，呢個就即係畀議員去考慮啦。因為我哋留意得到咧，其實即係喺現時嘅法例，其他任何一個條文咧都係冇用到呢個用語嘅。咁但係大家都知道，即係對於法律界嚟講，大家都。

504
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:37,200
理解乜嘢叫aggregate？咁但係一直以嚟都喺即係現行嘅條文底下冇呢一個用字，但係都其實一路都運作緊嘅。咁而家喺呢一個嘅誒審查處規則噉樣寫咧，其實會唔會即係喺睇起上嚟嘅時候就唔能夠容易理解？即係我哋成日都會講係咪user friendly咯？

505
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:57,210
咁所以即係一般市民睇到unless order係即係係會比較難理解嘅噉，所以即係我意見即係畀議員參考就係即係係咪需要喺依個審裁處規則入邊用一個技術嘅用語咧？咁呢個就畀即係議員同埋當局翻去考慮咯。我我相信你去考慮下個意見好清楚，即係一般人睇落去唔。

506
01:45:57,210 --> 01:46:06,740
啲咩叫unleashed？一個比較法律上一個一個技術上嘅用語，可唔可以寫得簡單啲或者清楚啲？噉我哋翻去再考慮。

507
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:27,030
法律顧問，係主席，我意思誒，亦都有一點想翻轉頭少少咧，就係關於頭先第四十條規則嘅就係主席嗰個提問啦。咁當然張女士就亦都即係誒話咗畀袁師咧，其實第四十條咧就係參考咗現時高等法院規則嘅第十八號命令第十九條咧嚟到草擬嘅。噉啊，主席誒有一點即係。

508
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:47,040
可能即係誒委員都會關注嘅，就係除咗喺第十四十條講緊就住每一次有一個法律程序嘅時候，法庭係點樣可以即係處理有關嘅申請嘅時候咧？我理解咧，主席就其實喺高等法院入邊咧，就有一種程序咧，就係高等法院規則嘅第三十二A號命令，就係我哋英文叫做vacuous。

509
01:46:47,040 --> 01:47:07,050
無理纏繞的訴訟人，咁嗰個咧就係根據高等法院條例第二十七條嘅情況啫。即係其實簡單講咧，就法庭有權做一個命令咧，就係唔準某一啲人咧，如果佢經常都提出一啲無理取鬧嘅訴訟嘅時候咧，就可以有一個法庭嘅命令，即係禁止佢再噉樣做嘅。噉就同而家即係第。

510
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:09,310
四十條規則，就住每一個。

511
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:29,600
實際嗰個法律程序咧就係有唔同嘅，咁所以我諗其實主席講嗰個咧就係高等法院規則第三十二A號命令，究竟係咪會都同樣適用於定審裁處嗰個法律程序咧？咁但係主席正如我剛才所講啦，喺高等法院嗰個命令底下咧，就嗰個基礎咧就係喺高等法院條例。

512
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:45,080
嘅第二十七條咧有個條文嘅，咁所以即係可能呢一度就政誒資產機構翻去即係或者都需要考慮一下，下次即係就住主席嗰個意見去回覆咯。唔該，主席。好啊，清楚嘅意見。好啊，我再再畀個書面回應。係。

513
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:55,670
請繼續啊！好，跟住係四十五條，四十五條咧係有關針對審裁處成員所作嘅一啲非正審決定嘅上訴一啲申請許可嘅程序。

514
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:57,620
係。

515
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:32,700
或者我哋去到第九嘅division九嗰度咧，我哋可以停一停，因為你誒仲有其他問題啊，要下一次開會嘅時候答。不如依一個係咪一個好嘅地方停一停？我哋審議埋之前頭先委員提出嘅問題、善議員同埋謝議員提出嘅問題，同埋法律顧問。

516
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:43,330
噉我哋你下次開會嘅時候可以一並回覆，噉我哋先繼續開始Division Nine好冇？好啊，OK，好啊，噉我哋就暫時停在呢一度先。噉我哋下一次開會嘅會期係幾時啊？

517
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,460
應該係四月十四。

518
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:58,210
應該得嘅啦，佢哋。我哋儘量誒答得幾多得幾多，我驚未必就可以全部答曬。八點半，唔該曬，唔該曬，多謝咁多位。係，Thank you。
