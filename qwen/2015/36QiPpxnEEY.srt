1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
誒，我哋嘅會議咧，而家係誒進入個議程第七項。

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,090
評估被收回物業價值，同埋解決因收回土地而引起嘅引致嘅糾紛。

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,830
就首先咧，我就歡迎。

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:32,180
誒出席議會議嘅政府代表誒名單咧，即係已經放咗喺誒委員嘅席上咧，我就唔做一介紹啦。或者我先請政府嘅代表先就呢個二項作簡短嘅介紹，唔知邊位？

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,580
嚇，蔡主席係多謝主席。

6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:52,550
誒政府喺誒進行公務工程，有時候誒會需要引用相關嘅法例去收回一啲私人嘅土地同埋物業。收回嘅時候，最常引用嘅法例咧，係香港法例第一百二十四章《收回土地條例》。

7
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:10,390
根據第一百二十四章嘅條文，受影響嘅前業主可以向政府索誒申索補償。建議嘅補償金額咧，就係由地政總署負責，根據相關嘅法例條文同埋適用嘅普通法嘅原則作出評估嘅。

8
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:20,980
如果受影響嘅業主唔同意地政總署建議嘅金額咧，嗰個個案就可以轉交土地審裁處進行最終嘅裁決。

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,150
喺呢個過程之中，業主可以聘用專業人士為有關嘅事宜提供專業嘅意見。

10
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,600
地政總署會參考呢啲專業人士所提供嘅意見，跟住就繼續同業主進行磋商。

11
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,430
根據法例，地政總署亦會償還業主聘用專業人士嘅合理嘅費用嘅。

12
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:54,750
委員可能亦都會關心，特別急關心喺地政總署就住金額作出評估嘅時候，會否考慮物業嘅重建嘅價值？

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,110
並且就住單一業權同埋分散業權嘅物業處理嘅方式，是否係唔同咧？

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,970
其實無論係單一業權或者係分散業權嘅物業，採用嘅原則其實係一致嘅。

15
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,680
地政總署係會根據收回物業嘅公開市值評估嗰個補償嘅建議金額。

16
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:38,220
一般而言，如果係單一嘅物業，因為業主擁有物業嘅全權嘅控制權啦，可以選擇重建或者可以將整棟嘅物業售予發展商作為重建。地政總署會喺呢一個情況下會將現有嘅用途嘅價值同埋重建嘅價值作一個比較。

17
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,160
並會將較高嗰個金額作為建議嘅補償金額。

18
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:59,780
而如果係一個分散業權嘅物業，物業嘅個別單位嘅公開市值，一般咧係指佔用或者獲取租金收入而付出嘅代價。呢個即使即係我哋所謂嘅現有嘅用途價值。

19
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,730
就分贊業權物業嘅重建價值嘅處理方法。

20
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:25,020
根據適用嘅普通法原則同埋過往嘅法例嘅一啲誒案例，如果有證據證明物業喺收回嘅當日具有重建可能性嘅話，地政總署係會評估物業嘅重建價值，然後咧同樣地會將呢個重建價值同埋現有用途嘅價。

21
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:34,280
價值比較，睇下邊一個係為之高誒較高，跟住就向業主作出補償嘅建議嘅時候，就用較高個金額嘅。

22
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:46,170
如果係委員有興趣嘅話，我哋可以喺稍後再誒就住何為有證據證明物業喺收回當日具有重建可能性呢個作較詳細嘅誒解釋。

23
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:56,970
議員可能亦都會有關心嘅咧，就係可否喺法定嘅索償機制嘅過程中加入調解嘅方式處理新索嘅糾紛。

24
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:14,310
正如剛才所講，喺現時嘅機制下咧，若果受到影響嘅前業主唔同意地政總署建議嘅補償金額或者其他嘅事項，其實係可以聘用獨立於地政總署以外嘅專業人士去提供專業嘅意見。

25
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,000
地政總署會根據法例支付業主聘用佔越誒專業人士嘅合理費用。

26
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:30,120
呢個安排嘅主要目的係要確保受影響嘅前業主可以喺申請補償嘅過程之中得到專業嘅支援。

27
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:40,450
若果業主同埋地政總署最終都仍未能夠達成一個協議，個案就可以轉交地誒土地審裁處去作最終嘅裁決。

28
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:51,940
現時嘅機制，我哋覺得係行之有效，包括為業主支付聘用專業人士嘅費用嘅做法，有助業主同埋地政總署達成共識。

29
00:04:52,530 --> 00:05:11,530
如果受影響業主提出以調解方式去處理法定補償嘅申索，地政總署會按個別個案嘅情況作出考慮。考慮嘅因素咧，包括糾紛嘅性質啦，以及誒進行調解會否對解決分歧有實質嘅幫助。

30
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,330
誒，其中一個前提係。

31
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:34,620
要個調解嘅程序同埋雙方達成嘅協議係唔能夠影響到政府或者土地審裁處行使法例賦予嘅權力。主席，誒以下我想誒誒邀請阿Mr Christopher Mills誒副處長就住評估嗰個誒補償嘅原則同埋一啲運作誒作一。

32
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,210
啲補充誒，唔知可唔可以？唔該啊，係啊。

33
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,610
廖主張。

34
00:05:40,260 --> 00:06:00,270
Okay, thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Celine, and good afternoon, Members. I think basically the paper sets out most of the points quite succinctly, and I think Celine's introduction covers some of the major items. But I just want to supplement a few things for Members' particular attention. The principles underlying

35
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:19,070
補償金額在香港來源於普通法通過法院，以及法例規定，因此提供限制，關於補償金額的彈性，以及如何處理補償金額。必須遵守法律和法例規定。

36
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:34,910
the the principles of the principle of equivalence is basically the fundamental principle underlying compensation. This is something which it governs the right for the owner to be put in the same position as he was.

37
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,310
before the resumption in financial term in financial terms.

38
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:49,530
and that not not to make not to be compensated more so, but equal amount, not not to suffer a loss.

39
00:06:49,810 --> 00:07:01,900
another another principle arising from the law is what is referred to as the point gourd rule, where compensation cannot cannot include an increase in value brought about by the scheme.

40
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:11,630
under the land resumption ordinance, there are various provisions which control the method in which the compensation payment should be assessed.

41
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:21,080
And it's basically the open market value, which is that that value expected to be realised by a willing seller in the open market.

42
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,460
subject to various considerations not being taken into account, and some other conditions being taken into account.

43
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,630
They're itemised in the paper, and the copy of the land resumption ordinance is also attached.

44
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:49,510
The land tribunal, Celine mentioned, is I think worthy of particular attention because the subject today is is also including mediation and and methods to resolve disputes.

45
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,310
already the existing mechanism of the Lands Tribunal is is set up under the Lands Tribunal Ordinance.

46
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:09,490
And it needs to be noted that the the land tribunal is composed of professional judges, four of them, and also two professional qualified surveyors.

47
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,870
所以，the hearings are conducted very much the same as a court proceedings.

48
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,950
and they come up with a decision which is fair to both parties.

49
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,410
And under under our land resumption and compensation regime, the claimants have the right.

50
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,790
to take their case to the land tribunal if if they are aggrieved.

51
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:40,160
The open market value. This is provided under the land resumption ordinance.

52
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:51,180
and in most cases this would be to compensate in terms of the price paid for occupation or rental received for a property, which would be the existing use value.

53
00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:02,620
If the ownership of the property is is single ownership, the single owner obviously has the option or the opportunity to proceed or explore redevelopment.

54
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:21,340
and we would assess a redevelopment value, and whichever is the higher would be offered. In some cases, the redevelopment value may not be higher. It's not automatic, but we would assess it on both bases and then offer him the right, you know, highest amount.

55
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,910
嗯。

56
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:35,750
The court of appeal has also ruled on on this redevelopment value and how it should be assessed. The test would include whether, on the balance of probabilities.

57
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,670
The evidence points to redevelopment of the property being very likely.

58
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,760
This must be demonstrated by actual proposals and evidence.

59
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,060
And regard would be had to developments taking place in the vicinity.

60
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:06,490
And that the development would be reasonably likely within a reasonable time frame. So we would take all these things into account in determining whether redevelopment was actually a feasible option.

61
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,410
嗯。

62
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,330
The single unit, the EUV would be offered unless the likelihood of redevelopment is so proven.

63
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,590
嗯。

64
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:39,910
In terms of, I just quickly want to refer to the dispute resolution aspect of the discussion today. Lands Department, we haven't so far adopted this. We're prepared to look at it, and I think government has replied to the honourable Albert Chan in a previous.

65
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,020
立法會質詢，back in March 2014。

66
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:51,780
And the entitlements and the procedures and bases are set out in the relevant ordinances and.

67
00:10:52,330 --> 00:11:02,090
We are obliged to follow those principles, so that the scope, the scope of those items which could be mediated, is actually quite limited.

68
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,250
嗯。

69
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:17,360
The legislative council, the the research office papers were were very helpful, and I'd like to thank the research office for their for their efforts in producing these information notes.

70
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:37,650
It was interesting to note that there are many similarities amongst the various jurisdictions, despite the fact that these jurisdictions are extremely different in other ways—economy, culture, social responsibilities, all that kind of thing. But there are there were many simila

71
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,360
相似性，came out and

72
00:11:41,320 --> 00:12:00,280
但係，研究 papers 一啲嘢，佢哋唔 refer to 係，

73
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:12,680
And it may not therefore be appropriate to compare Hong Kong directly. It's it's right that everybody should follow certain principles, but each jurisdiction must must have its own peculiarities.

74
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,630
嗯。

75
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:31,940
As I said before, for resumed land and buildings held by a single owner, RDV would be assessed, redevelopment value would be assessed, and the higher of of the of the amount between that and the existing use value would be offered.

76
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,500
to the claimant.

77
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:54,290
Before winding up, I just want to also make reference to our the Lands Department's Land Resumption and Compensation Guideline for Owners, Occupiers and Surveyors, which is a booklet which we produce, which is available on our website. It's it's given to all potentially affected parties.

78
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:04,450
and surveyors. It covers all aspects, including domestic properties. It talks about existing use value. It talks about redevelopment value.

79
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,090
它 mentions home purchase allowances.

80
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,880
The appeal mechanism, commercial properties.

81
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:32,280
And then it ends up. Also, the Lands Tribunal is made reference to, and it ends up by giving a contact in our acquisition section for further queries and offering our further advice and guidance. So I think I think claimants and practitioners have a good basis in this document to know what.

82
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:40,350
what is involved in the resumption of their properties and how to go about taking action to make a claim and also to appeal.

83
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,650
against the government.

84
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,550
嗯。

85
00:13:46,480 --> 00:14:06,490
I think just in conclusion, I think it's as we said in the paper, subject to the nature of the issues that are in dispute and whether mediation may enhance the the prospect of resolution, Lands Department is prepared to to consider mediation, and in fact this was spelt out by Secretary for Justice.

86
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,050
just last year in a written reply to a Legco question.

87
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:20,760
And we're prepared to consider such requests on a case-by-case basis, rather than at this stage, at least, introducing an across-the-board scheme.

88
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:37,780
And in fact, there are, I believe, one or two cases already where we have we are reconsidering cases, and the option of mediation is not excluded. We would obviously need to take up cases with Department of Justice and look at the rationale and the feasibility.

89
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:55,710
I think that's really all I want to say. I just wanted to highlight the main points. I'm here today with an assistant director from acquisition and also a chief estate surveyor for valuation. So if there's any any queries, we'd be happy to help and try and reply to our best.

90
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,280
好，唔該曬。

91
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:06,090
就誒有冇委員提問？誒胡志偉議員啊，四分鐘聯名應答先，四分鐘先嚇，代主席。

92
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:15,010
就住呢一個課題咧，我睇咗係政府嘅文件啦。咁其實我諗最大大家嘅爭議咧，就係在於即係。

93
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:35,300
單一業主當要計算嗰個賠償金額時間咧，就會係誒有多個元素叫做redevelopment，即係重建價值redevelopment values咧，係會稱睇下會唔會係即係正常價格，即係個市場價同埋嗰啲計埋個redevelopment之後咧較高為準啦，作為個賠償基準。

94
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:55,310
咁但係，如果小業主嘅話咧，你就指出就係話，只係因為或者我你就覺得就係因為佢哋根本就冇乜選擇嘅，平時都係平時都係即係好難去達成一種協議，就話我會重建啦噉樣，所以咧就唔會考慮佢個地，即係所謂重建價值，所以喺賠償嘅時候咧，只係按照即係佢當。

95
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,500
其時嗰個公平市價咧，去做計算嘅基準。

96
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:07,650
呢一個咧，我諗係即係誒，對於好多業主嚟講咧，覺得一個好唔公道嘅一個諗法，就係即係。

97
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:27,980
係呢個事實嚟嘅，一個業主佢擁一棟樓宇嘅話，佢當然有更多嘅選擇啦。佢可以出租，佢可以出售，佢可以重建，係嘛？小業主可能除咗自住用途之外，都冇辦法啦。咁但係一個地方有冇重建價值咧，其實都往往係牽涉到嗰個地方嘅實際情況嘅。譬如舉個例。

98
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:38,470
例子，我哋喺啲即係如果係市區舊區嘅話咧，其實好多地方都係面對緊一個所謂舊區重建嘅嘅題目喺裏邊。咁因此就話，如果

99
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:50,260
當你係去係話要喺呢啲區域，當然而家唔發生啦。咁呢個唔需要討討論啦。但問題就係，如果呢地方係發生咗一件事，就話我哋政府話要收翻某一個係住宅。

100
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:58,440
誒，然後就喺計價時間咧，佢就佢就因為佢係散收收嘅小業主嘅話咧，就唔可以計佢嘅重建價值。

101
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:15,090
咁呢個成個感覺就非常之即係覺得係，因為個距離會好遠啊！個小社區已經進行緊重建，一路有重建嘅係可能性喺周邊發生緊。咁但係喺計算嘅時間咧，就話唔使計佢嘅重建價值。

102
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:35,450
嚇噉，我諗我其實我提呢個問題嘅時間，其實我最大爭議就係呢一點。因為如果係一啲本身上冇乜重建價值嘅地方嘅話咧，其實無論你係要點樣樣做都好啦，一個業主好，十個即係或者散收收業主都好啦，都個計算出嚟嘅狀態咧，可能分別都唔係太過大嘅。特別你喺嗰個文件都講咗。

103
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:55,460
佢就係話：你都唔會係考慮佢要透過修改土地用途之後達至嘅重建嘅安排咧，嗰個係根據你哋嘅而家做現行做法嘅話係唔考慮㗎嘛？換言之，就係你唔會考慮就係話我手上有農地，收塊農地之後咧，我可能係會重建成為私人住。

104
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:10,020
宅就計私人住宅嗰種嘅重建價值㗎嘛，唔係噉樣計算。如果我理解冇錯嘅話，所以其實翻返去嘅基本問題就係話，即係如果個社區本身有重建價值嘅話，然後你就話畀我聽現有嗰個係賠款安排咧，其實係。

105
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,670
一個人嘅single owner嘅一個building block咧，你就會考慮佢嗰個嘅重建價值。

106
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,030
如果係分散業權嘅私業主咧，你就唔考慮，噉我覺得呢個係一個唔公道嘅做法。

107
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:41,320
誒或者政府可以講講，因為我頭先聽到，似乎咧就其中即係話即係散咗，即係話熱權分散嗰啲咧係考慮嘅時候咧，其中有一個因素咧重建嘅可能性先。首先考慮重建可能性，咁然後咧再去決定。如果重建嘅可能性有咧，我頭先聽到啊，咁當然咧就去計算啊重建。

108
00:18:41,320 --> 00:19:01,330
個價值同埋現時嘅價值，即係現有嘅價值嗰個比較，以高即係較高嗰個咧作為一個賠償嘅，或者呢樣嘢可能就誒阿胡志偉議員嗰度提問，或者邊位可以即係喺呢方面咧詳細先解釋下，即係誒嗰個做法啦，好嘛？好啊，誒多謝主席，誒。

109
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,290
就住誒胡議員提出嗰個。

110
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:24,650
正如主主席剛才所講，喺嗰個誒計算，如果係一個物業，無論係單一或者係誒分散業權都好，如果喺嗰度係有一個重建價值，係被視為有足夠嘅證據證明係有嗰個重建喺喺收回當日啊，係有。

111
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:44,660
嗰個重建可能性嘅話咧，就誒地政總署係會做呢一個兩方面嘅計算，即係一方面就係嗰個現有嘅用途價值，另外就係可能剛才啊啊胡議員講話比較可能高啲嘅金額嘅誒重建價值。咁當然就因應個案每一個重建價值要計過先至知道係咪。

112
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:54,630
高過嗰個現有嘅誒用途價值噉，但係可能嗰個主要嘅分別就係喺一個單一嘅業權嗰個情況下咧。

113
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:05,800
有一個基本嘅誒考慮，就係因為剛才都有提到話個全權控制嗰個考慮咧，所以嗰度就基本上就係已經假設佢一定係有嗰個重建價值。

114
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,390
但係喺。

115
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:27,920
分贊業權嘅情況下咧，就要有足夠嘅證據。咁至於足夠證據咧，部分就係一啲誒一啲客觀嘅誒誒環境同埋一啲客觀嘅事實嚟嘅。咁有啲亦都係有啲誒個案上嘅考慮。咁誒詳細咧，我可唔可以主席邀請誒Mr Mills或者補充一下裡頭嘅個中？

116
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:47,930
嘅原則同埋好啊！請啊，因為我諗大家都關注呢樣嘢咧，我即係花多啲時間咧，即係可以講講。即係請阿苗處長，因為頭先亦都提過一樣嘢，即係關於嗰個有啲案例，即係其中涉及咧就話，尤其是業權分散嗰啲咧，佢嗰個重建嘅可能性。

117
00:20:47,960 --> 00:21:07,970
係點樣？九千胡議員議員都提過啦，即係市區重建噉樣。咁市區重建嘅收地咧，其中一個可以考慮，即係據我瞭解咧，就係話佢雖然係重建咧，但係點解要去收咧？其實佢就話即係通過市場方面，佢嗰個即係集集合業權去重建嗰個機會，即係。

118
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:23,790
可能好低，或者經年累月都做唔到，咁先做。咁呢個都係過往我即係一般瞭解啦，或者請阿苗署長可以再即係就呢方面咧，或者再誒提供多啲意見嚇。

119
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:34,860
Sure, sure. Thank you, Chairman. I think obviously each case needs to be looked at on its own individual merits, with the facts and everything that speaks to that case.

120
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:55,150
The basic principle is the basic compensation principle is as I said before the equivalence. The the owner of the premises, whether he be a single owner or a multiple owner, is entitled to compensation in accordance with his interest in the land. If he has, if he owns one unit in a in a multiply owned

121
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:08,340
building or a site, he has no redevelopment potential himself. He only has development potential if he combines with the other owners and can show that he has done so. In which case, we would have regard to that.

122
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:28,780
所以那係基本上係 fundamental  thing。 我哋 not saying that a single owner, if you can show that he has joined together with other owners and has a development proposal, that would be reflected in the value of his interest. But most of the single unit owners do not have such an arrangement, and I think it would be

123
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:44,750
unfair and against the law and the statute provisions of the statute to compensate somebody beyond his entitlement and his actual so-called loss when we take the premises away for the for the public project.

124
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:56,910
誒誒，或者咁誒，我再follow咁喎，一間一間在，因為即係有有有另外委員都想誒，係一位葉國軒員。

125
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:17,890
多謝主席，其實都係真係好好地分享啦嚇，因為咧就以現在我聽到啊副處長好或者啊副秘書長都提及到咧，以現在誒單一業權同埋即分散業權嘅嗰個嗰方面嘅分別，咁咧就誒點樣分享咧？因為而家喺市區。

126
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,050
重建嘅過程之中咧，我哋有一個叫市區重建局嘅一個角色喺度。

127
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:43,340
當你如果以即係規劃或者個發展通過咗呢個係由市區重建局去發展呢一個嘅地段嘅情況之下咧，我就曾經確實出現過嗰個問題啦。因為咧，即係你係喺單棟同埋多，即係唔係係喺一個單一業主。

128
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:54,140
主業權嘅，同埋嚟講咧係多即係分散嚇，分分散嘅情況之下咧，就完全唔同咗。點解唔同咗咧？唔同喺邊度啊？係出現咗咧？

129
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:02,330
分即係嗰棟嘅樓宇，單一業主擁有成棟樓宇咧，能夠攞翻嘅賠償咧係非常之低嘅。

130
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,520
但係咧分散咧。

131
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:25,010
佢計落咧就計出嚟，咁都都都已經係不可，即係已經係多過呢個單一嘅多好多。點解咧？因為而家有我哋嗰個市區嘅嗰個重建計劃之中嘅賠償嚟講咧，我哋嘅業主住客裏邊係有不同嘅啊！啲業主自住嘅。

132
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:45,020
噉你嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅賠嘅嚟講咧，就就就就同你只係去同你咧係誒住，即係半個單位自己住，另一個單位另一個部分畀人租租畀人，以致到第三個單位租畀人嚟講咧，咁一路嘅減法嚟講咧，令到咧個個個價值嚟講係完全唔同曬。我所以。

133
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:59,060
咧，我頭先聽到話，你哋用翻嗰個整棟樓宇嘅價發展之後嘅價值，佢作一個賠償。我得個例子就唔係，因為依個已經嚟到重建區之下嚟嘅咧，佢就引用翻。

134
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:05,950
嗰個社會重建局嘅嗰個有有關嘅嗰個規例咧，就令到嗰個即係成棟都係佢嘅。

135
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:26,330
佢嚟講根本係攞唔到個個價錢，嗰嗰陣時係好多。我聽到都都其實成棟係誒誒四層樓高嘅，佢成棟攞五百萬嘅啫，成棟包埋地。噉你點可能會？你可以收到樓啫，收唔到喎，係咪啊？咁但係你分嘅嘢上嚟嘅時候，如果住如果個個都係即係即係誒誒誒喺。

136
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:46,340
喺喺喺度住嘅嗰個嘅個個嗰個嘅嘅嘅金額嚟咧，都成咦啊，二二千萬起碼以上嘅噉樣嘅結果。咁呢個同呢個原則上係有咩有咩嘢啊？下邊會產生呢種噉嘅現況，係咪市區重建區發展咗之後，呢啲我就唔需要跟而家？

137
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:55,910
當場我聽到嘅，即係單一業業業權下邊嘅嘅嘅嘅嗰個嗰個，仲整棟樓做一個評估嘅嗰個安排咧。

138
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:16,630
誒唔知清唔清楚啦，或者我諗蔡副秘書長咧，就我我相信葉議員講咧，就話市區重建嘅項目嗰個賠償嘅措施或者政策咧，係咪即係你你可以解釋一下啦？因為頭先可能講咧，我哋講一啲係根據收回條例，即係法例賦予嗰個誒，即係。

139
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:36,640
應該賠償嗰個機制同埋市區重建，而家即係收。頭先可能啊葉議員咧都指開咧，即係指出咧，可能係尤其是啲住宅嘅嚇嗰度，或者你可以講講解釋下，因為可能分分鐘計出嚟咧都唔夠政府或者市區重建賠畀佢嗰個數嘅，係咪咁意思嚇？誒。

140
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:56,650
對，好啊！唔該，主席誒，或者我哋請誒Tony誒，可以提供一啲資料。好啊，冇用聲，多謝主席誒，多謝葉議員嘅提問。我相信啊，葉議員係講誒提及嗰個係一個叫做自治居所嘅誒津貼，係啦，即係七言扭離嗰個賠償。其實嗰個就唔係一個法定嘅賠償嚟嘅。

141
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:16,030
嚇，發電賠償就係講嗰個公開市場嘅價值。噉我哋喺誒URA市建局收地嘅情況之下咧，佢係有一個津貼嘅。誒，even我哋喺誒政府真係收地嘅時候咧，都會有一個津貼嘅。嗰個係自治基礎津貼，就係令至到嗰個。嗰個法例嚟嘅喎。誒，不是法例，嗰個係我喺度通過點解唔係法例？

142
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:35,730
嚇七年樓齡嗰個係咪法例嗰度講明嘅？亦或係一個政策上可唔可以澄清一下？誒七年樓齡，我覺得一個叫做自置居所津貼，並不是係我哋一二四章裏邊所提及個法定補償係啦。只係政府一個誒政策上係提供畀受益開業主一個額外嘅津貼係咯。

143
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:56,380
誒，我我諗我再查啦，即係即係一二四章肯定咩？一二四章啦，可能即係我而家就只係隱隱身去去講喺土地收回，因為呢個都有土地收回嘅問題。但係咧誒，有翻個賠償嚟講係一個法例通過嘅，嗱，即係你又係即係照照我嘅記憶之中，因為我在係啦喺喺喺喺立法會有份舉手。

144
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:15,010
要要過呢個條例噉，所以你話唔係條例，我就奇怪啲嚇。不過你入唔係一二四章，可能就係咁解嘅啫。誒主席係誒呢個字字珠珠嘅貼，就係我哋當年係二零零一年咧，係通過誒立法會嘅財委會咧，係得到財委會嗰個誒誒財政上嗰個同埋政策上嘅支持嘅嚇。噉我哋係誒當年係係個立法會嘅。

145
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,730
我個並不是法例。

146
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:37,300
誒或者我個解釋多少少咧，就係一個七年樓齡就係誒自住業主就係七年樓齡啦。如果非自住業主咧，其實就係冇咁多嘅，即係得減半嘅嚇。咁所以頭先你可以提得嗰個情況就係呢個情況嚟嘅。係我唔知個時間啱唔啱，即係我而家個問題，你即係回翻到去啦。出現嘅情況就係，即係你如果按翻我。

147
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:57,310
嗰個噉樣自居即係居居所嘅上下邊咧，佢呢個錢嚟講就肯定多過於咧係單棟。咁點解唔係即係單棟會係去去到咁低嘅價錢咧？即係你因為佢又唔能夠自己去去買，因為依個已經係法例上要畀劃入到嘅重建區。咁點解你唔係跟翻你而家嘅土地收回條例？

148
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:17,320
嘅嗰個嘅機制去做一個單一業主嘅噉樣嘅賠償嘅嘅嘅嘅方式去做，而係用剛才頭先我舉嗰個例子咧。唔好意思，我唔知係如果嗰陣時間我去排隊再問好啊，或者噉啊，即係等阿謝偉俊議員問完先啊嚇。謝偉俊議主席嗱，兩組問題，第一個咧，或者先講講關於個。

149
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:37,330
嗰個所謂協調或者mediation嘅問題啦嚇，噉我理解到文件裏邊咧第十二段咧就我睇英文版本咧，佢類似意思就係話咧，由於誒牽涉到嘅課題咧或者爭議多數都係牽涉到一啲嘅誒法律原則嘅誒適宜或者係誒點樣引用咧，於是就唔適合做一個。

150
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,430
協調機制啦，噉係咪調解啊？調解啦嚇，mediation啦噉。噉我諗下，其實。

151
00:29:43,710 --> 00:30:03,720
我哋所有法庭就要求雙方去作一啲調解機制嘅案件咧，有邊單案件唔係牽涉到一啲法律原則嘅一個日適宜，或者係個引用咧咁？如果呢個用原因嚟而而誒否決咗調解機制嘅誒引用性或者適合性咧，我覺得有啲誒我就接受唔到嘅。我就想聽多少少誒有。

152
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:23,730
尤其是因為而家我哋法院本身都盡可能希望任何有糾紛、任何有誒法律訴訟嘅雙方都經過一個誒調解機制先嘅，咁呢個係個大原則、大方向嚟，係可以省時省力，亦都減省咗一啲嘅訴訟嘅矛盾。我想聽聽點解政府呢邊企得咁硬咧？咁即使唔係強制性嘅協調嘅調解機制咧，起碼都。

153
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:34,330
用多少少，唔好似而家咁咧，係一一概不用啦。呢個第一問題。第二個問題咧，關於剛才兩位議員都提過個問題咧，關於嗰個誒就LTV同埋EUV嘅差額嘅問題啦嚇。

154
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:54,620
誒，我明白到咧喺賠償方面咧，當局係當然希望有一個比較嚴謹啲嘅，啊，甚至係清晰啲嘅鎖定咗個條嗰個賠償，就唔需要下下咧咁多酌情合咁多考慮。咁從行政角度話，呢個係可以理解嘅，但係從公義角度睇咧，就好多時咧就已經再加強咗社會。

155
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:14,630
好多小市民、小業主咧，覺得咧係佢哋個別嘅權益咧，係受到啲大業主誒或者一啲有財有勢嘅財團咧，佢哋收購之後嗰個價值差咁遠。咁呢方面咧，當然我明白到嘅，即係往往我哋喺法律上嗰個嚴緊嘅law strict law同埋個equity嗰個公平或者公義。

156
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:34,640
做一個平衡，咁而家我哋似乎就太過喺死板方面誒誒着力，但係忽略咗公義方面嘅問題考慮。咁呢個會唔會有一個可以我即係初步構思咧？有冇能夠一個所謂clawback嘅情況，就係話若干期、若干情況後、若干時段後，如果

157
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:54,650
真係的，而且由於收購情況令到整個地咧整體嚟講係貴咗好多嘅，而小業主個別嚟講係攞攞唔到呢個賠償咧。若干情況滿足之後，若干時間過咗之後咧，都仍或者時段內咧可以再有個誒重新去檢視翻嘅機制，可令到佢哋嗰啲小業主咧唔會話完全損失曬佢哋應該有嘅喺有公義。

158
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,080
角度睇應該有嘅比較足夠嘅賠賠償咯，係兩個問題。

159
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,080
哦。

160
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:20,370
調解誒就住調解嗰度咧，其實誒喺嗰個誒伸索個補償，因為喺嗰個誒第一二四章嗰度底下嗰個過程喺誒由提出嗰個伸索嗰個誒開始，地政總署就已經係一路同緊嗰個前業主一路。

161
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:40,380
有溝通咁喺嗰個環節裏頭，其實誒亦都剛才都有提及，就或者會係有專業人士都參與，而專業人士嘅費用亦都喺個法例裏頭係可以誒補償翻嘅，係可以提供翻嘅。咁如果合理嘅話，咁嗰度其實已經有一啲係誒類似磋商。

162
00:32:40,380 --> 00:33:00,390
嘅嘅過程嘅，咁嗰嗰啲咧就唔會受到嗰個誒條文嘅限制，咁所以有有個空間喺度。但係並非由第三者作出比較公正、公立或者被認為係公正公平嘅一個調解，而係你只係由地政署作調作。我同你講下啦，咁噉係即係令到個嗰個受損者或者申索者覺得係話對住成個。

163
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:20,400
部門喎，我點同佢拗啊？點同佢講啊？噉係唔同嘅，即係第三者嚟做機呢個調解係唔同㗎嘛。誒而家其實個機制的確就即係唔係揾一個誒調解員噉樣樣，但係而家就可以揾一個獨立於地政總署以外嘅或者幾位都可可能係，即係可能部分係誒一啲測量師，亦都可能有其他嘅律。

164
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,320
師啊，誒會計師啊，即係視乎個個案嘅情況，咁嗰個專業嘅誒誒意見咧，係會被。

165
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:47,780
地政總署參考噉就繼續同嗰個誒前業主磋商嘅。咁呢個就的確未達到誒誒謝議員所提出提出話做一個調解員嗰個嗰個角色嘅。咁但係個法例賦予嗰個框架就喺度嘅。噉我哋咪收禮啦。誒，如果誒咁有嗱，似乎咧。

166
00:33:47,780 --> 00:34:07,790
即係如果係一個因應個個案情況，即係好似剛才啊啊，Mr. Mills都有提，即係如果個個案考慮到嗰個情況係有足夠嘅空間，而係覺得係可以幫助到誒達成一個誒共識嘅，咁又係唔影響個法例賦予嘅權力嘅情況下咧，我哋真係唔排除會用誒用。

167
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:27,900
調解嘅，而亦都真係有一啲個案，而家剛啱誒進行緊嘅，就係要考慮緊，視乎誒嗰個誒前業主提供畀我哋嘅資料誒。我嘅理解係未完全誒收集齊嘅。咁喺收集齊咗之後，就要再同律政誒事誒處嗰邊就研究係唔係用調解咧噉。

168
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,260
依個其實我哋。

169
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,400
係。

170
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:50,720
係開放嘅個態度，但係就的確未試過有噉樣嘅個案，所以我哋亦都唔敢話嗰個效果會係點咧。咁去到呢個階段，我哋因為又未試過個案嘅情況下，我哋就唔傾向係用一個嘅好概括性，所有嘅個案都不如採納呢一個方案行啦。噉我哋就呢個階。

171
00:34:50,720 --> 00:35:00,380
段就覺得應該係因應個個案去考慮。好啊，就誒跟住第二。不過call back嗰個想聽聽有機會。唔係，我諗第二，因為已經過咗好耐。

172
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,240
誒胡志偉議員都係四分鐘，你問唔問得？代主席。

173
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,040
誒，其實喺聽翻咧。

174
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:29,990
就而家我一二四章咧，就用咗兩個概念嘅，就係呢一個重建價值就賦予畀呢個單一業主。如果係分散業權嘅業主嘅話咧，就用一個叫做係即係市場公平價咧，係作為個計算嘅基礎嘅。咁但係咧，如果係嗰啲個案咧，係去到U A手上邊嘅話，

175
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,520
話咧。

176
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:50,810
噉就係一般就係話會加入嗰個嘅係誒自治居所津貼呢一個噉嘅部分，噉佢令到就係即係如果係自治居所嘅業主或者係半租嘅業主，可能又會分到其中嘅一個比例啦噉樣樣。咁其實即係如果將呢啲數值加埋嘅話，其實會唔會？

177
00:35:50,810 --> 00:36:10,820
都係反映到嗰個整體嘅係，即係個重建價值咧，都某程度上係反映咗喺裏邊咧。咁呢個第一個部分，第二個部分就話，如果真係已經反映咗，即係透過各種唔同嘅津貼，係反映咗嗰個嘅係誒重建價值嘅話咧，咁其實係咪喺我哋？

178
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:30,830
即係説明呢一啲噉嘅，所以賠償安排嘅時間其實可以講得更加清楚咧。因為我哋譬如做區咧，其實經常都遇到就係話，你睇政府啊計親呢啲數就唔計重建價值畀我哋嘅嚇，噉我哋覺得好即係業主覺得好唔公道啦噉樣樣。咁但係可能你透過其他各種唔同嘅渠道咧，係一啲嘅津貼。

179
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:50,840
安排咧就已經令到就係嗰個實質嘅係數額已經係去到一個相當於重建價值噉嘅情況。第一，我唔係好掌握係咪真係噉樣樣，但係即係似乎你哋加咁多嗰啲津貼嘅項目咧，其實某程度都想係令到個實質嘅賠償額咧係接近嗰個有重建。

180
00:36:50,840 --> 00:37:10,850
價值嘅反映嘅，咁噉我唔知啱唔啱，但係如果真係噉樣樣嘅話咧，我就好希望即係政府一諗，我哋話點樣向公眾説明我哋嗰個重建，即係我哋當要收地賠償嘅時間嗰個計算咧，其實重建價值係透過即係幾種唔同嘅渠道咧係有反映到，而令到就係話咧業主。

181
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:30,860
覺得佢都係受到公平嘅對待，我想聽下呢一部分好啊，或者想講講，不過我誒即係應該澄清一下，一二四章並冇寫明單一業主係用重建價值嚟計算嗰個賠償，或者請畀時間我講。唔唔該，主席誒係啊，就住誒第一二四章裡頭咧，佢就係就住嗰個誒。

182
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:45,070
公開個市場價值，同埋佢咧係會寫咗話誒係因應個評估個補償嘅原則噉樣羅列咗出嚟嘅。噉佢又的確，正如主席頭先講，就係冇特別分開處理話乜嘢叫做誒誒。

183
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:53,980
重建價值，亦都冇特別話單一嘅業權同埋分散嘅業權係唔同嘅組別噉樣處理嘅，噉佢就。

184
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:06,350
純粹係即係就住嗰個估，即係評估嗰個補償嗰個原則噉樣樣，就因應呢啲原則。噉就剛才你提到就話，如果係唔係誒喺嗰個？

185
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:27,340
喺喺嗰個評估嗰個話誒嗰個過程之中，咁的確就係嗰個過程之中咧，就係會考慮到有冇重建價值嗰個嗰個範疇啦。咁咁而家如果有嘅話咧，咁嗰個公開嘅市場價值就可能會高咗，噉就金額由誒地政總署提出嚟嗰個。

186
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:43,350
誒補償個金額咧，個建議就會係一個嗰個金額就高過嗰個現用嗰個誒用途嘅金額噉樣樣，噉就唔係一二四嗰度就用重建價值嚟做一個概念噉樣樣嘅。唔係，我諗住可唔可以講清楚？當然我我明。

187
00:38:43,630 --> 00:39:01,370
法例就唔會寫得咁細緻啦。咁但係問題就話你都係誒喺嗰個觀念上面，因為你文件噉樣寫㗎嘛，佢你就話如果係單一業主嘅啟嘅考慮裏邊咧，個賠償嘅跟住十二噉嘅十二D，好似嗰個寫法就係話佢就會按照就係呢一個誒。

188
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,970
佢會畀佢係個。

189
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:24,380
應該噉嘅地政署嗰個係考慮嘅賠償基準咧，就會係將佢嗰個市場即係現有狀態同埋呢一個重建價值咧，係兩者去相比較，然後就較高者為準啊嘛。咁但係如果係分散業權嘅話咧，就冇咗呢一個噉嘅係即係誒做法，就只係考慮佢嗰個嘅係。

190
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:44,390
誒嗰個市場嘅現況，即係而家而家流餘嘅現況，就去做考慮，就睇佢個市場上面收翻翻嚟嗰個賣界點樣樣咧，就用嗰個基礎計算佢嗰個嘅賠償準則啊嘛。或者我嘗試噉樣講，或者即係可能稍後同時再補充誒。其實基本上咧，就喺呢個誒第一二四章嗰個嗰個誒活。

191
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,170
誒收回土地嗰個過程咧。

192
00:39:47,880 --> 00:40:07,890
以嗰個公開嗰個市場價，嗰個就係誒嗰個誒起步啦。咁喺計嗰個公開市場價嘅時候，當我哋有個個案係遇到係誒單一嘅業權，噉我哋就喺依個噉樣嘅情況下咧，就基本上咧，我哋就認定單一業權佢可以重建嘅空間咧就。

193
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:21,610
相當大嘅，咁所以我哋咧就同時就誒認定佢係有埋依個發展嘅佢重建計劃，可以佢可以實行到，咁所以咧就即係見到單一業權，我哋就一般而言就傾向係會。

194
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:41,900
不如一齊兩樣都計曬出嚟，咁以高嗰個金額做嗰個建議金額啦。噉，咁喺分散業權嘅情況又有啲唔同啦，又係個出發點個起步點，亦都係用嗰個誒市場嗰個公開嘅市場金額嚟做起步啦。咁跟住就去到第二步，究竟做唔做嗰個重建？

195
00:40:41,900 --> 00:41:01,910
金額嗰個股選咧，咁嗰個咧就要因應係有冇足夠嘅證據去證明可以有發展嘅誒，可以有重建嘅機會。咁以嗰個咧就係如果係話啊會噉，於是咧就頭先剛才就話地政總轉亦都會喺有一部分嘅，如果係分散業權嘅情況下。

196
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:21,920
如果係有足夠嘅證據係話會做到重建嘅咧，佢哋同時都會做曬兩個估算嘅金額，一樣係等同即係好似單一業權嘅情況，將兩個比較邊一個係高啲嘅金額咧，就拎出嚟做嗰個建議嘅索償金額噉樣。好啊，下一位葉國軒爺，多謝先頭先嘅問題都係。

197
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:41,930
昌根芬，誒，我相信慕容生佢哋嗰嗰個表達啱嘅，因為嗰個都應該財委會個個嗰個決定噉，所以零二史建局嚟講咧，係需要根據嗰個賠償嗰個情況產生。咁但係個問題，即係你而家一二誒四章嚟講咧，對於真係如果遇著噉嘅問題嘅下邊，點樣去？

198
00:41:41,930 --> 00:42:01,940
即係即係，如果我聽完之後，係咪即係變成咗嗰個重建嘅計劃嘅嗰個嗰嗰嗰得益啊？啊，嗰個重建價值咪變成咗？客觀上話，可能就係嗰位單一嘅成棟樓嘅業主係分享唔到嘅，而係嚟講咧，變成咗市建局去佢佢。

199
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:18,730
即係即係分享咗咯，點解就客觀出現咗噉嘅現況，而造成咗咧，即係即係對一啲誒單棟樓，即係即係擁有成棟物業嘅嘅嘅業主嚟講咧，有不公平嘅現象咧，喺呢個問題上應該點樣先就能夠取得到個平衡咧？

200
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:39,020
係長棟業主，佢你哋會唔會考慮都係有重建㗎嘛？重建考慮噉，當然即係頭先啊啊苗處長都講過，重建嚇計出嚟未必一定係個價值高過現在嘅價值嘅，現有嗰個使用個價值嘅都有呢啲情況嘅。我所知。

201
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,010
誒。

202
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,780
可唔可以就啊葉議員嗰個方面，你哋提供一啲即係意見？

203
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,770
慕容先生，係慕容先生。

204
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,430
係，多謝主席。誒，多謝阿葉議員嗰個誒問題。

205
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:04,110
誒嗱，一二四章裏邊咧就係規定咗我哋誒嗰個賠償嗰個計算個準則，就係一個公開市場價值。

206
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:24,700
簡單嚟講就話誒，普通人去買一層買一層樓係幾多錢就係幾多錢咯。噉樣樣就唔好當我哋而家係收地，因為法例講明就話我哋要當呢個唔係一個強制性收地嘅情況之下，去估算翻我個樓價值幾多錢嚇。舉個例，噉我去太古城買個十號A單位係幾多錢咪幾多錢。如果

207
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:44,710
業主話：我要計承座樓嘅重建價值，咁正常人都唔會畀佢㗎嘛，係因為佢唔可能去做重建㗎嘛啊。就係咁情況之下，如果我哋做收地嘅時候遇到嗰個單誒一個分散業權嘅業主話要一個重建價值，我哋諗一諗，咦有冇機會重建先？基本上係冇嘅，所以我哋唔會諗啦。但係如果係成棟樓，

208
00:43:44,710 --> 00:44:01,010
都係佢擁有嘅話，佢話：，誒，我可以諗諗喎，拆咗起個係仲貴啲，你會賠畀我㗎。當然我會考慮呢個因素啦，嚇。所以就有一個嘅重現價值同埋一個現用價值我個比較啦。嚇，翻翻頭先，葉議員講一個誒自治居所津貼咧，誒。

209
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:21,300
依個係一個誒，基本上係一個安置嘅政策嚟嘅，因為咧，我哋收咗業咗一層樓嘅籌咧，我哋係想佢可以有個誒地方誒再誒住翻嘅，所以咧嗰個出發點就係方便佢喺同區附近買一個比較新啲嘅樓，一個七年嘅樓，因為純粹一個房屋一個誒安置嘅政策。

210
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:36,330
就同嗰個賠償冇關係嘅嚇，賠償咧，我哋只係賠償翻一個七年誒賠償一個誒物業本身嘅價值嚇誒，點解賠一個自住嘅津貼咧？就係方便佢買翻一層樓，佢安置翻佢嗰個誒住住嘅需要嘅啫。

211
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,260
多謝主席。

212
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,430
葉曉明有冇跟著？

213
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:46,960
好，我想説嘅解唔到嗰個問題。不過佢只係講翻現有嘅政策，我都識啦依個問題。

214
00:44:48,370 --> 00:45:08,380
謝偉俊議員，主席，我都想跟進翻剛才嗰個所謂clawback嗰個情況，因為誒，我哋喺無論辣椒又好，或者好多其他情況之下咧，如果啲係目前見唔到嘅情況，但係若干時限內發生咗嘅事實咧，我哋可以係有啲嘅特別嘅無盡補償又好，或者額外徵税又好，都我哋都見過㗎啦。咁如果

215
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:28,390
都要解決而家呢個噉嘅問題，喺當然即係而且咧喺評估嘅時候咧，可能當時嘅情況對於重建又好，對於佢嘅可能性咧，可能都證明唔到嘅。但而事實上，可能兩三年之後真係成棟收曬翻嚟，而真係個價價值可能多咗好多十倍嘅噉嘅情況之下咧，嗰啲業主個別少業主就可能覺得係唔係好公。

216
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,450
度噉樣，咁有冇辦法可以有啲嘅比較有？

217
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:52,740
追討翻或者係一個retrospective嘅clawback嘅嘅情況，我唔知點樣翻譯做中文啊！啲對唔住，即係事後追追索翻嘅一個可能性，令到嗰啲有關嘅少主覺得喺賠償方面唔會係過分地被一啲大財團或者係甚至有有時係政府嘅部門咧，係喺個評估上咧係吃咗佢哋誒。

218
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,660
誒，即係吃吃虧咗，或者令到佢哋受損咗咧。

219
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:16,110
誒或者可唔可以講講你頭先假設就係你嗰個即係之後咧，佢收購咗之後嗰個價值升咗，係唔係因為因為市場咧？剛才講話咩？太古城嗰個單位就唔會重建啊。咁譬如如果三年之內真係成棟太古城收購咗而真係可以重建咧，咁咁嗰啲個別嘅賣咗嗰啲喺個三年內係咪可以都追究翻？

220
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:23,700
翻或者去試下嘗試申申索翻一個比較合理嘅賠償咧，咁即係類似呢類噉嘅構思，即係唔係因為市場升值？

221
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:43,990
唔係淨係市場經濟，而係因為基於一個原先嘅，譬如話無論申請嗰個規劃大綱圖嘅改變又好，或者係一個誒重建嘅建議又好，喺當時評估嘅時候可能冇可能，或者唔再有足夠證據證明。但係事實上喺兩兩年、三年之內真係發生咗，然後真係批咗嗰個重嗰個誒市建局，或者。

222
00:46:43,990 --> 00:47:04,000
住嗰個誒誒規劃署批咗嗰個大光圖嘅改變，又或者真係重建嘅計劃咧，係實現到嘅，收購咗翻嚟可以做到嘅。咁呢情況之下，咪有冇咩可以所謂叫追殺翻嘅可能性咧？The clawback嘅可能性係邊位？係咪在副議長？誒，主席係誒，多謝謝議。微博都走曬噉啊！你。

223
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:21,600
誒啊，嗯，我哋喺嗰個架構上，誒而家嗰個誒框架度咧，係因應誒收回嗰個土地或者個單位當日嗰個誒嗰個情況而做嗰個誒評估嘅，咁誒。

224
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:41,890
因為噉樣嘅嘅框架有即係剛才啊啊，Mr. Mills都有提，即係喺嗰個公平嗰個原則上，即係因為係嗰一日做嗰個當係交易日噉樣啦。咁過咗幾年或者過咗長又好、短又好嘅時間，誒要翻轉頭計算翻嗰個差。

225
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,190
可能有啲難度啊！

226
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:52,180
誒，因為即係始終我哋計算、我哋估算嗰個收回土地個係有誒。

227
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:58,320
係一個公務嘅誒誒項目啊，或者公共用途啊，噉樣喺嗰一個時空。

228
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:18,730
嗰一刻嗰一陣做嗰個誒評估，所以嗯要做翻過即係時間過去之後補償翻。我恐防冇未未未見過有噉樣嘅情況。其實你如果收傷辣椒嘅時候咧，你嗰啲重建嘅收唔收咧？如果你一一若嗰陣時候真係重重建嘅咧，其實又可以豁免。

229
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:38,740
變翻，即係其實係有呢啲情況可能性嘅。問題就係你從一個執行者角度講，係儘量簡單好啦，儘量死板好啦。但係我從一個社會公義睇咧，就係話好多業主覺得唔公義，收咗之後咧原來爭咁遠嘅。噉我希望可以試下啲補救翻，係純粹咁講，係一個一個情一個平衡翻個嗰個社會情況嚟啫。咁呢個當然牽涉到修例咧。

230
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:58,750
但係問題就係喺政策上係咪呢個原則上可以諗一諗嘅咧？好，可可將個社會公義減即係增加佢咧？係咪淨係誒？即係有升值嗰陣時先就有升值咗。當然，如果折咗本就收本就收，重建咗當然升咗好多價值嘅。噉就呢種情況，我哋經常發生見到係誒。

231
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:18,760
有冇補充時間過去，可能的確即係啲誒知道嘅情況，或者嘅誒誒係會清晰咗多咗資料，但係亦都個市場誒究竟會係升啊跌啊個情況，亦都唔能夠預測啦。誒啊誒，Tony會唔會可以補充先先？麻煩你主席。係。

232
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:31,810
冇用聲。主席啱啱都提過，就係誒有一個機會就係唔一定係升嘅，即係如果幾年後發覺誒蝕咗本，噉我哋冇可能翻轉頭問翻我接唔接落翻錢嚇。我諗呢個考慮都係重要咯嚇。

233
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:52,450
而家嗰個即係想誒，而家當然頭先提過咧，即係話個賠償嗰個誒個價值嗰個計算嗰個時間咧，即係個日子咧就鎖死咗，鎖死咗實啦，鎖死咗嘅呢個呢呢個其中係一個即係問題。噉我我反而就話即係誒政府方面可唔可以講一講咧？因為鎖死咗咧。

234
00:49:52,450 --> 00:50:12,460
有陣時，頭先講講個賠償咧，即係有陣時需時。嗯，噉啊，嗰個情況點樣去誒令到嗰個？頭先好似阿阿苗處長講咧，就話佢佢冇冇蝕底度，冇蝕底度係呢度方面，即係政府而家嘅政策係點啊？呢個誒，除咗即係法例而家嗰個框。

235
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:20,970
之外，亦都係我個理解係誒誒普通法裏頭嘅原則嚟嘅。誒唔知道，Mr Mills，Would you，Chris，Would you like to supplement？

236
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,160
我 just。

237
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:43,780
Yeah, I just like to thank you, Simeon. I just like to point out that the whole basis of resumption, in accordance with the statutory requirements, is the open market value at the date of resumption. I think, as chairman, you just pointed out, it is a fixed date valuation. And once we start retrospectively looking back and and

238
00:50:43,780 --> 00:51:03,790
paying out extra later, you can imagine how do you devise such a system which is fair and manageable? I really don't see how you can do it. And the principle is something similar. What happens if I sell my flat today and the market increases by fifty percent in years to come? Why should I expect to get that fifty percent?

239
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm selling it today at the the value that it's at today in accordance with the lease.

240
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,820
restriction. So, it just the principle doesn't seem to be fair either.

241
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,350
係。

242
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:38,410
啊，二講二嚇，三分鐘啦，你問我。我再再想跟緊，即係如果按照翻頭先我講嘅例子，亦聽翻頭先阿梅處長嗰個提法，都睇到咧，即係唔應該使到，即係嗰個個個物個業主啊喺依一刻能夠嗰個價值蝕咗或者賺咗，已經。

243
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:58,420
都睇翻嗰陣時嘅價值。噉我用翻頭先嘅例子嘅問題咧，就係即係如果以按照翻真係重建少少重建嘅嗰個當時嗰期有處理過程之中，先結共咧就唔能夠按照翻以現在嘅成棟樓嘅價值去賠佢。

244
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:18,430
都係話要跟翻，即係有關嘅嗰個誒誒誒誒誒租住啊個誒，即係個個個津貼嘅嗰個噉樣嘅配發，佢畀翻呢一個嘅業主咁噉係咪咁？呢個係咪即係造成咗又即即係對佢一個嗰個係咪真係實際上有損失？呢個事實。

245
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:38,440
嘅，因為嗰陣時嘅樓價絕對不可能係頭先我舉嘅例，即即嗰個價錢咁買到。但係市建局嚟講咧，佢亦不可能佢按照現時嘅一二四章裏邊嘅執行，我要跟翻重建局裏邊嘅嗰個嘅賠償嘅準則，遵遵照賠償即七年樓啊咁嗰個咁咁呢個問題。

246
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:47,440
矛盾應該點樣去解決翻咧？即係係佢真係咪冇權去跟一二四章咧？因為佢有權跟一二四章，佢冇去做咧。

247
00:52:48,180 --> 00:53:02,080
係，即係依依，你點樣放到喺依度嘅情況下邊，去點樣處理先至係即係可以解決到，即係對嗰個業主嘅畀翻個公平喺佢喺身上邊咧？

248
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,830
誒。

249
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,870
邊位？

250
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,510
係冇錯先。

251
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:28,800
誒，我未必掌握到啊。業員，我個問題誒誒，基本上誒，市建局佢就係唔會用一二四張去收地嘅。佢自己有一套誒收購嘅政策嚇。當佢誒同業主誒達成唔到協議，咁又要去做一個市區重建項目咧，噉佢就會要求政府就誒幫佢用一二四張去收地。

252
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:43,240
咁到嘅時候，政府就會跟翻一二四章裏邊我個賠償嘅準則啊，即係賠翻啲誒公平市值，我個畀個業主啦。咁再加上就係誒一樣啦，誒事見哥又好，政府都好咧，都係一個七年樓嚟，我一個自己叫作津貼嘅賠償畀佢嘅。

253
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:58,020
即係話喺嗰個時間嚟講咧，史建國係唔能夠用一二四張啊，係嘛？到到佢強即係呢個攞唔到嗰個百分比咧，佢就只能用強拍。強拍過程中就用一二四張，係咪咁意思啊？

254
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,390
係基本上係，啊，你做得。

255
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:20,300
係啦，咁誒市建局佢只可以同嗰個居民就係誒仲賣誒市場去嗰個價值去磋商賣層樓嚇。我如果業主唔肯賣嘅時候咧，就冇法子啦嚇。噉就一定要用翻誒靠政府嗰個誒一二四章嘅，同埋誒市建局條例裏邊嗰個賦予權力就係政府幫佢收地嘅。

256
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,410
誒，跟住胡志偉。

257
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:48,700
二三分鐘，我好快，最最後最後一round啊！其實咧，誒頭先根據誒地政署嘅回覆咧，其實就係你係用一個叫公平市值咧做基準嘅，即係無論乜嘢花款都一單一業主好，單業權好，即係誒多即係分散業權都好啦，都用呢個做基。

258
00:54:48,700 --> 00:55:08,710
冇錯，不過咧就係如果單業權嘅話咧，喺你考慮佢嗰個賠償金額時間咧，你因為覺得佢係會更有可能係進行重建好cleaning crown嘅安排，所以咧其實嗰個你就會有個自動嘅機制咧，就係同時考慮佢個賠償準則嘅話咧，就差唔多就自。

259
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:28,720
仲考慮咗，佢應該都會有一個係重建價值畀佢去去稱兩隻之間計埋嗰個重建價值，計埋個重建價值畀佢稱啦噉樣樣。咁但係咧，如果你話係分散業權嘅話咧，就因為覺得佢喺機制上能唔能夠推動重建咧，都成疑問，所以咧原則上就唔會點計嘅。不過，如果係能夠報舊年。

260
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,200
話我真係可以做重建啦，噉樣樣咧，噉你就會計落去啦。

261
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,410
我我理解冇錯喺呢點上邊，係嚇。如果呢啲冇錯嘅話，其實我有有一個直接嘅問題就係。

262
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:49,840
一個社區咧，或一個地段咧，可唔可以重建咧？其實同個地段係有關係嘅。當然啦，我我理解就係即係你。

263
00:55:50,220 --> 00:56:10,230
即係我諗，今日大家都做過好多舊區啦。喺舊區裏邊咧，其實就係已經即係誒，大家都會係想象嗰個小社區嗰啲重建咧，一路都行緊，所以係一個重建嘅expectations有有個重重建嘅預期，可能你覺得難都唔頂嘅，可能去去可能做唔到強拍或tever嘅嘢。咁但係當你去到。

264
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:30,240
會變成一個係用一二四張嚟收收購嘅時間咧。其實第一，當你行得呢一步棋嘅話咧，個重建價值咧就會自動浮現咗出嚟㗎啦，因為已經係執行緊嗰件事啊嘛，必然就會大家以前達成協議都好啦，都達成協議啦。第二就係話，你會唔會重建咧？喺嗰一剎那咧，其實就已經唔係一個業主定係。

265
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,150
十個業主嘅問題係你本質上都會重建啦，咁所以我先覺得就係話咧。

266
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,590
嗰個考慮應該係首先要解決咗，就嗰地段本身有冇重建價值先。

267
00:56:40,910 --> 00:57:00,920
咁然後你先至即係有呢個基礎㗎。如果嗰個社區特別，我哋而家市區成日都有重建價值，即係重建區呢個問題嘅話咧，其實應該就用呢個概念就係係嗰個地段本身有冇重建價值去決定咗個基礎，就唔係話倒翻轉嗰件事就係誒我我我你證明到你能夠從

268
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:14,390
重建啦，我先至去考慮你有冇重建價值。噉我諗，我諗嚟，我諗法係噉樣樣咯。係，我我我覺得即係頭先，因為誒苗處長講過咧，就可能呢個法例嘅問題。法例咧就講嗰個即係誒。

269
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:23,720
頭先講個scheme，即係即係因為嗰樣嘢咧，就嗰嗰個法例就唔可以考慮呢樣嘢。頭先講譬如話誒舊區。

270
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:42,550
遲早重建，你誒用個法例就可能令個重建加快，咁但係因為用強制嗰樣嘢咧，可可能就喺個法例而家咧就計算個賠償嘅時候咧就唔可以考慮呢個因素嘅，或者邊位可以補充我？即係頭先聽到我只係覆上一次啫。

271
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,760
誒。

272
00:57:47,040 --> 00:58:07,050
You understand questions? Thank you. The effect of the scheme, whether you should be taking account when assessing the compensation. It's completely been ruled out by the court judgments. It's something that is a given. We have no, even if we wanted to, we have no flexibility. That the court has ruled such that we don't take into account the scheme, and in fact it's in the statutory provisions as well.

273
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,430
Well, it's it's it's very clearly stated.

274
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:30,200
O.K.即係個法例上邊本身就已經寫死咗，唔可以有任何彈性。同埋亦都有好多案例，即係考慮呢樣嘢嘅嚇。誒，跟住謝偉俊議員三分鐘，我我都好快，我只係想回應翻剛才阿阿苗力恩先生講個例子咧，即係話如果而家賣樓噉，當然賣將將來。

275
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:50,210
來結咗嫁，我而家唔可以改變咧。咁但係我哋一唔係講緊只有自願性嘅買賣，一係主要係係主要係政府收回嘅地。噉我嗰個例子，我相信就未必係完全可以可以比較到。而最主要就係我哋強制性收回嘅時候，究竟個賠償係唔係應該係一個劃死條線喺嗰個時間上係收嗰？

276
00:58:50,210 --> 00:59:10,220
下羅定定嗰下咧，定還是係時候。如果真係發覺到有個重建嘅價值，啊，係大遠遠超過原先嘅個別嘅價值嘅時候，有冇個靈活度咧？我當然明白到有啲案例咧，包括個嗰個叫咩誒判地據地，我唔知係點讀讀法啦嚇個rule啦。咁但係問題就係誒，我哋而家講嘅可能係如果真係係嚴重。

277
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:30,230
地或者不斷收到市民投訴，覺得唔公義嘅話，我哋係咪應該考慮下可以修改，將個靈活度放寬少少咧咁解啫？咁呢個我我明白你哋而家目前你作為一個行政人員，梗係希望盡可能入到切切死曬，冇咁多嘢拗添啦。咁問題就係我哋覺得切得太太死太實正啊嘛，噉啊有冇嗰啲公義啲嘅做法啊嘛？

278
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:45,580
有冇補充？誒補充啊！啊蔡副議長，係誒主席誒嗯，就住嗰個誒原則誒或者嗰個做法誒，除咗啲誒啲。

279
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:51,470
案例啦，誒，我哋誒嗰個政策上，同埋因為嗯。

280
00:59:52,470 --> 01:00:12,480
喺嗰個誒收地個過程之中，就係因為我哋誒就住一啲公務工程咁喺嗰個嘅前提下咧，就我哋收地嘅時候，雖然嗰個誒，正如剛才阿謝議員講，唔係佢自願買賣嘅，係一個誒，你可以話係一個法例上強。

281
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:23,890
制要求佢將呢呢一個單位或者大大土地係即係等於買咗出嚟噉樣啦。咁但係喺嗰個誒，無論係嗰個誒誒依個。

282
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:44,560
法例個框架同埋喺誒喺嗯普通法嘅原則咧，都會以一個係一個願意賣嗰個單位或者賣嗰個誒嗰塊地，同埋一個願意買嗰個單位同埋一個誒嗰塊地而做嗰個誒公開市場價值嗰個嗰個誒估價噉，所以其。

283
01:00:44,560 --> 01:01:04,570
其實原則性喺嗰個誒普通法嗰度，同埋一啲判判例。對唔住我，我打斷你，因為我哋立法會咧就唔係淨係講現有法例同埋現有嘅法律原則，我哋講將來嘅可能性。如果唔係，我哋唔需要喺度討論。一問題就係話，如果而家係太死、太一刀切嘅話，係咪有機會可以微調啊，令至到啲市民唔會覺得係咁受喺公義上受損害咁解？

284
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:24,580
啫嘛，嗯，但係喺嗰個誒，因為收地始終係係有一個誒收地嗰個嗰日嘅誒動作，而我哋而係要有一個確實嘅估價，噉佢誒先至誒嗰個前業主可以接受嗰個估價。噉我哋都要因應嗰個誒過程。誒喺呢度。

285
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:36,800
我誒只能話係我哋冇噉樣嘅打算去去將依一個誒誒增間嗰個嗰個誒誒，即係將嗰個日子係擴闊到去長啲咯，係啊。

286
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,090
好啦，我係。

287
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:59,470
誒，好好兩分鐘啦，我諗我諗差唔多，你收位嚇嗱。其實誒，我我知道今日咧，我哋嚟嘅咧係負責即係行政嘅同事啦，咁所以一定係即係手語調試啦。但係呢個政策嘅問題，事實上我哋誒立法會嘅秘書處咧都做咗一個研究，個研究亦都反映到就話其他。

288
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:19,480
其他嘅地區咧有一啲唔同嘅做法，甚至係佢會多數，即係點啊？其他地區嘅做法咧係會誒更加積極啦，我唔敢講一定啦，更加積極去考慮嗰個嘅係即係嗰個所謂公平價值嘅定義係點樣樣啦，佢嗰個所謂重建價值點樣睇啦，呢啲噉嘅元素嘅。咁但係我見到。

289
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:39,490
咧就係署方嘅回覆咧就好簡單，就話誒唔係㗎嗰啲唔可以就咁比較嘅噉。咁不如我具體咧就話誒，第一我諗，既然我哋秘書處咧做咗一個噉樣嘅係即係觀察啦，其他其他地方、其他城市咧係就住土地收回嘅時間所作嘅賠償嘅安排，係有多啲唔同嘅。

290
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,620
元素係即係介紹落去，即係深入落去，令到更加公平公義。

291
01:02:43,900 --> 01:03:03,910
誒，政府你要答覆或者你要係即係質疑我哋秘書處嗰個研究嘅結果嘅話，係咪應該都有更加具體嘅係資料咧？係作為一個反駁噉，我哋可能都會條氣順啲都唔定。因為如果唔係嘅話，你淨係話唔可以就咁比擬咧。誒，我諗大家都唔會好容易接受到呢。

292
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:10,260
一個説法，而只係覺得就係話你係冇注意到喺個過程裏邊，我哋只係考慮。

293
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:30,560
單即係一個係單業主，佢嗰個可以重建嘅可能性係大過分散業權嘅係朋友噉，因此就話咧，佢就會計呢一個重建價值畀佢稱，但係咧分散業權嘅話咧就唔計。咁其實大家係覺得你噉樣嘅做法咧係有一個唔公道，事實上更加令到我哋感覺。

294
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,840
唔好咧，就係單一業主，好明顯地就係佢嗰個能力。

295
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:56,130
自然係會比分散業權嘅私業主咧係為強嘅。而個法例咧啱啱倒轉，因為通常我哋法例都講就話，我哋希望係即係提咗個公平嘅原則，亦都希望就係話透過啲公平嘅原則咧，係幫到啲弱勢嘅社羣係嘛，即係調教嗰個balance咁解啫嘛。咁但係喺呢一個做法裡。

296
01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:16,140
裏邊似乎就啱啱個天秤就唔係噉樣稱法咯，咁所以我希望咧，即係部門好或者處方好咧，都要再睇一睇。如果你係想質疑呢一個我哋呢一次噉嘅討論嘅話，因為我咁差唔多時間啦。咁但係我希望你哋喺回應嘅時間咧，能夠真係好具體指出，就係我哋秘書處、我哋研究部所做嗰個研究咧，其實你覺得佢。

297
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:27,980
反駁或者係佢覺得唔可以引用嗰個原因係邊一處？除咗頭先你，即係你講咗一啲嘅係就咁寫咗兩隻字啫嘛，就話即係佢哋嗰個業權嘅情況唔係噉樣樣，噉係咪噉樣樣嘅一回事咧？多謝主席。

298
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,950
係有冇補充添嘛？政府方面。

299
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:54,270
I just like to say that we don't we don't necessarily rebut these papers. In fact, we find a lot of the information contained in the papers perfectly acceptable, and Hong Kong doesn't deviate on many fronts on the critical the critical aspects of this this subject. Hong Kong is is quite in alignment, for example, with England and and some of the other.

300
01:04:54,270 --> 01:05:00,580
所以我們不我們不 rebut 或 reject 這些報告，我們認為它們基於堅實的研究。

301
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:09,130
We don't we don't see the need to to respond in any formal way. We don't feel aggrieved by the content of the report.

302
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,190
and.

303
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,390
I think.

304
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:17,950
I think we're quite happy to leave it at that. But I think we have to also bear in mind, from comments, that we must respect the law.

305
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:25,100
And it's the law that that governs and controls much of what we do in this context of compensation resumption.

306
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:33,480
好，誒呢項議題咧討論到此為止啦嚇，噉我冇其他事項，就宣佈會議結束，多謝大家。多謝。
