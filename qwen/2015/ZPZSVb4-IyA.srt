1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:23,450
關注審批基建項目啊撥款申請進度緩慢嘅問題嘅議案辯論，有意要求議案辯論發言嘅議員請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。我現在請石禮謙議員發言及動議議案。石禮謙議員。Mr. Acting President。

2
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,920
我 move the motion as printed in the agenda.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,730
Mr. Acting President, the Occupy Movement has evaporated from our streets into the thin air.

4
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:44,840
但不幸的是， stand-off between the pan democrats and the government continues in this council.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,670
resulting in the lacklustre pace in vetting and approving, funding applications for infrastructural projects.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:05,460
which has already created an unwarranted situation that could bring about a medium to long-term detrimental effect to the socio-economic development of Hong Kong.

7
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,980
This concern is the essence of my motion debate.

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,540
Mr. Acting President, I shall start this.

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,070
Motion debate of a question.

10
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:36,360
有冇？在過去18個月，作為立法者，我們這個受人尊敬的議會，履行我們的職責， diligently，如要求的，根據基本法第73條的條文，這要求我們審查和批准政府開支。

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,730
嘅。

12
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:44,750
judging from the records of our performance in approving funding proposals of capital projects.

13
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,930
We have failed desperately.

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,520
In 2013 to 2014 legislative session, we approved capital works projects.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:04,810
到達了微弱的3.6百億美元，相比2012、2013年會超過90百億。

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,830
And 201 to 2011 to 2012 session of over 160 billion.

17
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,220
This represent a drop of over ninety percent, and is really a shameful act of this council.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:31,970
such a significant drop is significantly due to the filibustering and the recent non-cooperative movement launched by some of.

19
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:51,740
The pan democrats, they manipulated established procedures and delayed the progress of meeting by submitting a multitude of amendments, raising repetitive and superfluous questions and moving motions to adjourn discussions on agenda items.

20
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,750
resulting in the sabotaging of quite a number of funding applications for economic and social development projects.

21
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,400
many of which were postponed, shelved, or even withdrawn.

22
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:16,700
Over the past few years, filibustering took place during debates on government budgets and motions related to constitutional development.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,660
and rarely on social, economic and livelihood issues.

24
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:35,370
但為咗原因，831 MPCSC決定，就選舉首席執行官，2017，非正規組別已經擴展到每一個方面。

25
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:43,630
of the work of this council, with intent to confront and immobilise the SAR government and its policy.

26
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:57,590
Many many shared funding applications on infrastructure projects are entrapped in unnecessary debates and delay for the sake of political combat and confrontation.

27
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,490
This development is really a political tsunami.

28
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:14,450
Not long ago, it was the pride of this council that we have adopted a rational, pragmatic manner in handling council issues for service to the community.

29
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:34,740
Majority of our members were rational when handling socio-economic matters, while heated debates and conflicts over constitutional development have continued over the last 17 years, often harsh and bitter. But for social and economic issues, we were able to agree.

30
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:52,800
to disagree and resolve conflicts at the discussion tables by examining and considering government proposals in a fair, cooperative and constructive manner, in response to the many previous accusations against the Democrats.

31
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,990
of being anti-government and stirring up unnecessary trouble in this council.

32
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:18,320
民主黨用來辯解，和理所當然，即係，除咗憲制問題之外，佢哋唔係為咗對立而對立，正如由政府所給予嘅支持同合作，顯示咗政府對社會、經濟同生計相關嘅項目。

33
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,830
嗯。

34
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,370
和政府 legislatures。

35
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:32,040
Now the current non-cooperative movement of the Pan Democrats is a drastic change of tactic from cooperation to confrontation.

36
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:52,330
甚至延展到非政治和社會經濟政策，他們採用了過度 aggressive 的態度，去爭取每一個議題，特別是特別是基建工程，為取得所謂的真正全民普選。

37
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,580
如果 no changes are made,

38
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:16,080
The SAR government, the Hong Kong economy as well as the livelihood of people, will all suffer from significant adverse consequences. Mr. Acting President, as we all know, infrastructure projects affects all walks of life, both economically and socially, both our

39
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:36,090
我們的競爭力和我們的長期發展，取決於這些基礎建設項目。因此，無論我們的衝突如何大，關於憲政發展，或我們中的一些人對SAR政府和現任首席執行官的領導不滿，我堅信，

40
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:44,170
We shouldn't regard the relevant funding applications as bargaining chips and use them to put pressure on the SAR government.

41
00:06:44,450 --> 00:07:01,770
after all, constitutional development is only one part of the overall development of Hong Kong. Fighting for democracy and genuine universal suffrage shouldn't be bundled up with issues that affect our economy and local livelihoods.

42
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:12,610
Otherwise, the overall interests of Hong Kong will damage irrecoverably. Mr. Acting President, we all know our competitiveness.

43
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,330
是極為重要，對香港生存。

44
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:37,150
scarcity of land and natural resources pushes us to leverage our advantages in the rule of law, institutional structure, efficiency, infrastructure and geographical locations. Over the years, thanks to our outstanding infrastructure network, Hong Kong has continued.

45
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:48,800
繼續 to gain top positions in global competitiveness rankings. However, with severe global competition, we must continue continue to sharpen our competitive edge.

46
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:56,560
It is now our choice as elected representative of the people, to grow or to rot.

47
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:16,850
And the buck stop here in this council. We are here to approve or disapprove funding proposals of capital works projects for the growth of Hong Kong. In fact, Mr. Acting President, years of heavy investment in infrastructure have not only equipped us with abundance of space for.

48
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:36,860
Further development, it has also provided us with an effective and efficient transport network for social, cultural and commercial activities. Most importantly, our connection with the neighbouring areas have been enhanced, facilitating further integration, strengthening our position as an

49
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,690
國際城市，和鋪設堅實的基礎，為我們的可持續發展。

50
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,620
And as a leading city of Asia.

51
00:08:46,170 --> 00:09:06,180
Furthermore, investment in infrastructure projects holds a special position in improving local livelihood. Regrettably, the outstanding applications in the year 2013 to 2014 cover projects such as construction of schools, public hospitals.

52
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,520
公共 housing、social work and the list go on and on.

53
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,460
The delay in approving these projects, which we have only approved 3.6 billion dollars project.

54
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:37,750
has actually precipitated many problems for the future development of Hong Kong, affecting the livelihood of the people. Given that our infrastructure projects have been delayed, the development of new areas has also been affected. We have already.

55
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:45,790
浪費了寶貴的時間。過去的18個月，是時候追上，否則我們會輸掉。

56
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:55,540
On the other hand, Mr. Acting President, the construction industry have expressed deep concern over the delay of funding for infrastructural projects.

57
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:15,900
There are currently 360 construction workers in Hong Kong, which constitute about 10% of local employees supporting the livelihood of over 1 million people. Following the previous downturns in the construction industries, many construction workers became then and

58
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:32,170
making them extremely sensitive to decreases in funding of infrastructural projects. They worry that the continued delay in funding will cast a shadow over the development of construction industry and create a domino effect in which

59
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:40,580
The industry enterprises will cut their investments in response to the lack of cash flow caused by the drop in government funding.

60
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:53,990
at the same time, the problem of ageing and the lack of new blood are also hampering the construction industry at the moment, resulting the present shortage of skilled labour as we have discussed this morning.

61
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:14,680
年輕 workers not only worry about demanding better working environment, but are also concerned about the prospects of the industry. Not only do they want to see a fair return for their hard work, but also they have good prospects should they decide to join the construction industry.

62
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:32,670
If funding continues to be disrupted, project will not commence as scheduled in the next seven to ten years, creating a vacuum of uncertainty that will lead to further decrease in the number of new workers coming into the industry.

63
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:42,650
Past experience have actually shown that in such cases, the number of new construction workers will drop, and this is the present situation in Hong Kong.

64
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:58,410
先生，過去和現在的延誤，亦都意味著建設成本的未付工程將進一步增加，而需要浪費更多公帑來完成這些工程。

65
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:10,090
The SAR government is the applicant for these funds, and its liaison, particularly with the pan-democrats, is apparently ineffective.

66
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,430
thus, in today's motion.

67
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:32,740
我 propose that the administration should face up with these problems and proactively work with this council to seek solutions for the sake of Hong Kong as a whole. We should focus on the overall and long-term interests of Hong Kong instead of the potential gains or losses of some.

68
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:40,150
individuals or political party, I started off with a question, and I like to conclude with a challenge.

69
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,990
to this couns to members of this council.

70
00:12:45,010 --> 00:13:05,020
That we should diligently discharge our duties as under 73.33 to approve government projects to the tune that we have actually approved in 2011 to 2012, that to 160 billion or whatever the government give to us.

71
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,590
多謝，主席。

72
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:27,150
我現在向各位提出嘅代議議題係石禮謙議員動議嘅議案，予以通過。有兩位議員就依項議案動議修正案，本會現在就議案同埋兩項修正案進行合並辯論。我會依次序動議，請動議修正案嘅梁升議員。

73
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:33,180
同埋梁家傑議員發言，但現階段佢哋唔可以動議修正案。吳亮昇議員。

74
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,140
多謝主席。

75
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,520
主席首先係感謝石議員提出呢一個對經濟同民生都係十分之重要嘅議案。

76
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,020
當前喺議事堂討論呢個議案係有個必要性。

77
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,600
嘅時間上咧，就似乎係遲咗啲。

78
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,610
可以見到，爾寺堂咧，如果拉布塞車咧，不止係拖慢咗。

79
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:05,880
我哋嘅基建項目審批，亦都會殃及到我哋議員嘅議案嘅辯論。

80
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,560
基建咧係可以帶動經濟，中外加熱。

81
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:31,850
上世紀嘅三十年代，我哋睇到美國嘅羅斯福總統咧，就係推出個新政。當時嘅新政係大力投資喺基建，喺一九三三年到一九三五年咧，投入咗當時嘅三十三億嘅美元，建造咗三萬個工程項目，將美國帶入。

82
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,530
一個由大蕭條嘅深谷嚟到重新出嚟。

83
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,800
呢個。

84
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:47,940
基建方面係方便咗營商，提高咗城市競爭力，並同時係改善市民嘅整體生活質素。

85
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,090
亦都唔係一般講叫做大白象咁嚟抹殺到佢嘅。

86
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,830
根據世界經濟論壇發表《二零一四一五年全球競爭力嘅報告》咧。

87
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,410
香港係排名第七。

88
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,460
其中基建係排名反為第一，得分係六點六九。

89
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,010
排名第二係新加坡，得分係六點五四。

90
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,050
報告指出，香港喺基建支柱係領先嘅。

91
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,540
反映佢所有嘅喺交通模式、設施方面有突出嘅質素。

92
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:34,140
亦可見到基建乃係香港競爭力嘅其中一個重要組成嘅元件，係不容有失嘅。

93
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:44,210
近年嚟，香港嘅競爭對手不斷投資喺基建、交通、物流等等硬件，係有不斷提升嘅。

94
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:56,350
我哋睇翻鄰近嘅廣州咧，便係設計投資八千兩百八十二億人民幣咧，喺十二個大嘅基建工程。

95
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:16,900
其中包括有城際軌道鐵路主輸樓、航空輸樓等建設投資，接近係佔咗七成嘅投資項目。廣州地鐵早已經開到佛山，白雲機場第三條跑道亦都喺去年就開工就完工。

96
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:25,650
相反咧，香港同鄰近城市交通接駁進展都唔算大啦。第三條跑道咧，而家仲未定案。

97
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,290
香港基建一路躊躇不前咧，令人係心以為憂嘅。

98
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:39,410
究其原因咧，我哋亦都睇到所謂反對派不合作運動咧，係確實係有責無旁貸嘅。

99
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:48,100
本人贊同石議員嘅議案咧，至於提出修訂咧，就係着眼於第一。

100
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,860
對於八合作運動喺本屆立法會之初咧，係已經啟動，唔係由一三年。

101
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,650
自一四年納百年度先開始，而係由一二年至一三年已經開始咗一個。

102
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,790
好似係長者生活津貼呢類咧，就拖延咗個頗長嘅時間。

103
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,850
當時目的就係意圖攤換政府施政。

104
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,780
呢一種政治鬥爭咧，並非係以事論事，亦唔係以市民福祉為依歸。

105
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:34,120
喺上一個立法年度咧，政府原計劃係向立法會提供，係提交三十九項共一共有四百三十億嘅新工程項目。

106
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,640
經過一輪拉布，大家都知道，最終財委會咧只係批出到十三項。

107
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,360
輸入金額咧係三十六億，落差都好大。

108
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:52,670
基建延誤咧，不只係影響業界同埋員工，仲影響到眾多市民嘅日常生活。

109
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:06,040
比方公共交通工程嘅延誤咧，係會令到每日要所謂擠迫嘅、逼沙啲魚嘅，同埋望到頸都長嘅市民咧，係等。

110
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,560
有關交通工具咧，悶悶輕嘆。

111
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,250
另外一點咧，就係震壞咗香港經濟長遠嘅發展。

112
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:22,070
會必然導致香港喺全球競爭力會落後同埋捱打。

113
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,080
產業亦都因此而會流失。

114
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,510
最後嘅代價係香港會變成二流嘅城市嘅。

115
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:39,000
第四點咧，解僆還需係令人嘅，要使到議會秩序恢復正常。

116
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,640
唔係淨係政府單單方面可以做得到。

117
00:18:43,920 --> 00:19:02,810
而係政府當局咧、社會大眾咧、立法會咧，係都一齊有責任。所以，我喺原動議裏邊咧係提出一個修訂，就係積極同本會呢幾個字眼咧，加上咗係各方嘅團體以及人士。

118
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:16,740
關鍵係反對派要放棄逆民意嘅不合作運動，喺呢個商業城市裏邊係唔應該時時以政治去作為計算嘅考量。

119
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,820
轉而要關注以民生經濟務實態度去議事。

120
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,900
大家都記得。

121
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,490
去年十一月五號嘅立法會上邊咧？

122
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,200
喺九個小時嘅會議裏邊咧。

123
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:41,900
個別議員提出咗十七次嘅點人數咧，足足係花多咗三個多小時。

124
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,450
呢個喺全球嘅議會嚟比較咧，都肯定係一個不尋常嘅議會文化。

125
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,050
所以包括運動咧。

126
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,160
聽聞據稱仲有來嘅。

127
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,640
啊！當然唔係叫好戲在後頭啦。

128
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:15,620
咁所以而家又亦都有提及到咧，會喺財委會啦、財委會以下嘅兩個小組委員會上面進行拉布、拖延撥款，去包括創新科技局嘅成立呢啲嘅項目。

129
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:26,150
全港各方團體同人士等等咧，對呢啲噉嘅情況咧，都應該一齊行動，一齊。

130
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,730
要監察議員嘅表現。

131
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,940
對不合理嘅現象，應該多發表意見。

132
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,360
向不負責任嘅個別反對派呢啲抗爭咧！

133
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,870
係應該抗議佢哋破壞民生項目呢啲行動。

134
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,890
嚟制衡呢啲不當行為嘅繼續嘅進行。

135
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,850
此外咧。

136
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,350
啊！只有各界嘅。

137
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,190
團體。

138
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:07,230
近期係逐步已經表達出對議員拉布嘅不滿，我哋睇到啲工商業專業等團體咧，都甚至列隊出嚟示威抗議。

139
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:20,270
讓市民大家都認清到拉布係會打爛市民飯碗，等於係與民為敵，所以必須係撥亂反正。

140
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:31,030
因此，我係奉勸個別議員以經濟民生為重，使到議會咧重回正軌，去造福市民。

141
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:39,870
讓勞工界、工商界、工程界，甚至所有有關嘅專業界別，都同樣得益。

142
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,080
主席本人僅此陳辭。

143
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,010
梁家傑要。

144
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,970
多謝主席。

145
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,530
主席，我咧就。

146
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,270
誒有機會咧，就同。

147
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,840
一個。

148
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,860
建造業大聯盟嘅十五個團體嘅代表咧，就喺本會嗰度咧見過面嘅。

149
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,970
好出奇地咧，主席。

150
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,190
或者閣下都未必諗到嗰個結果係噉嘅。

151
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,260
大家傾完之後咧。

152
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,660
我得到呢十五個團體嘅代表咧。

153
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,210
一致咧，又取得個共識。

154
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,020
就個矛頭唔應該直係指向立法會嘅公務小組委員會。

155
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:28,010
其實咧，最喺度玩緊政治、最能夠有權去移動議程嘅，就係梁振英。

156
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,130
咁竟然咧，我哋。

157
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,210
喺經過大概一個半小時嘅會議之後咧。

158
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,990
佢哋都同意呀，啱喎，劉宇元你講得啱，我哋咧會向特首都會爭取。

159
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:50,990
咁不過可惜咧，就係特首咧名還不靈啦。噉啊，最近咧就主席都應該知道喺財務委員會嗰度咧就。

160
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,330
佢抽起咗四個。

161
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,940
呢一個。

162
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:03,080
攸關民生嘅項目啦，啊，包括咗咩咧？有兩項嘅係學校嘅資訊平台嘅撥款咧。

163
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:12,550
一個咧誒項目咧係要加多十幾隻水景輪啦，一個項目咧就係畀消防處咧買水炮嘅。

164
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,610
噉啊，為乜嘢而讓路咧？主席就係為咧。

165
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,720
佢梁振英啊！

166
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,550
喺度香港搞呢一個內地嘅長官意志。

167
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,460
政治。

168
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,170
籌用僭建工程咧嚟讓路嘅。

169
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:50,810
嗱，主席，當然咧，我已經表達咗，我覺得即係用呢個撥款條例草案嚟處理啲四項民生項目咧，根本就冇先例，係唔係應該咁做？係咪符合香港嘅憲制秩序？我都覺得好大嘅疑問，有個問號喺度。但當佢得啦。

170
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,430
梁振英嘅語言藝術咧就話：，嘿，我。

171
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:06,120
冇影響到呢幾個民生項目嘅，因為咧喺二零一五一六年度嗰個撥款條例草案處理咪得咯噉。啊，主席，我相信閣下都知道啦。

172
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:26,420
若果佢上星期五已經上咗嗰啲學校資訊平台，上埋嗰十八隻水積水景輪同埋水炮咧，只要財委會一撥咗款，即刻就可以攞啲錢去買船啦，買水炮㗎啦嘛，去建構個資訊平台㗎啦嘛。但係如果佢真係當佢冇違軒啦。

173
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,620
喺一五一六年度撥款條例草案處理咗先算咧。

174
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,920
起碼，我覺得最保守嘅估計。

175
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,980
起碼都前五六個月先可以動用到嗰啲錢嚟到買水警輪。

176
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,980
嚟到買水泡，嚟到做中學嘅資訊平台。

177
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:57,200
咁究竟邊個喺度玩政治咧？邊個喺度犧牲攸關民生嘅項目嚟到做政治鬥爭咧？嗬！

178
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,730
我相信咧，嗰個結論咧就好清楚，一定係梁振英咧。

179
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,990
噉佢而家搞呢啲嘢咧？

180
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,710
好奇怪喎，主席。

181
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,640
嗱，我咧就試過作為公務小組。

182
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,700
誒委員會啊，主席嘅。

183
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,820
呢個身份咧，就試圖去調嗰啲已成項目啦。

184
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:30,910
咁而民主派咧，亦都喺財務委員會咧，要求個誒張宇仁議員咧做為主席咧，係要調項目嘅。

185
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:42,070
咁張雨人主席同埋本席咧，都分別從陳家強局長收到一封信，嗰封信咧都有以下嘅一段説話嘅，我引述。

186
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:51,880
政府就公務小組嚇或者財務小組就財務委員會嚇議程作出預告時。

187
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:02,250
議程文件的次序均反映政府對各項開支建議的整體緩急優次的看法。

188
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,700
除非。

189
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,320
有特殊情況，例如。

190
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,240
緊急救援。

191
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:29,530
避免標書逾期失效等，否則開支建議的排序一般不會改變。引述完畢。咁究竟梁振英咪話畀我哋聽，佢呢一個即係好似學啊內地嗰套噉嘅長官意志簽建糧粉局長工程。

192
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:41,880
係震災咧，嗬，即係唔係覺得自己面對一個政治災難，一定要加多一個良粉入去，先至可以幫佢處理呢個政治災難咧？

193
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,260
咁唔係啦，係咪？咁點會係緊急救援啫？

194
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,940
標書逾期失考，呢個唔係佢哋用嘅理由喎。

195
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,350
而且創科局冇標書㗎。

196
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,800
點會有標書失效嘅考慮咧？唔係主席。

197
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,850
咁呢個係顯示乜嘢咧？即係話梁振英咧。

198
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:18,920
就唔會畀我哋去關注民生，將一啲咧攸關民生嘅項目由後面抽上嚟。但係如果佢要做政治鬥爭，佢要做。

199
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,500
呢一個長官意志政治纏片工程咧，佢隨時做得。

200
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,350
即係話佢喺兩封信度。

201
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,840
畀財委會主席同埋公務小組主席嘅。

202
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,900
嗰啲唔係理由嚟嘅，主席。

203
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,870
只係藉口。

204
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,000
最清楚不過啦。

205
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,750
如果唔係，點解佢最近會做呢件事咧？

206
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,980
嗱，主席。

207
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:58,010
當然，泛民主派咧，對於要做好香港嘅資訊科技咧，我哋係舉手舉腳贊成嘅。但問題就係佢而家呢個做法啊！

208
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,100
係令到人齒冷啊！

209
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,280
第一，佢好嘥錢。

210
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,250
二千二百萬經常開支嗰啲嘢，而家有人做緊㗎啦。

211
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,500
咁點解要加個位嘅？

212
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,020
第二。

213
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,480
呢個係蚊營局嚟㗎，主席。

214
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,220
真係蚊型喎，因為咧，佢個機能咧係好少。

215
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:27,600
創新領域最大範嗰個叫通訊咧，仍然歸蘇錦良局長個局繼續管嘅。就算有個新局都。

216
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,050
咁另外，主席啊，而家劉振英做咗一半任期啦。

217
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:39,630
最初上任嗰陣時就開唔到位，而家做咗即係一半有多啦。

218
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:46,640
就喺度夾硬嚟開呢個位，咁唔係鬥氣，唔係搞政治鬥爭，係做咩？

219
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,180
咁但係佢搞呢個鬥爭。

220
00:28:49,830 --> 00:29:03,000
佢做呢一個鬥氣嘅行為咧，就犧牲咗嗰兩個中學嘅資訊平台啊嘛，犧牲咗十八隻水警輪同埋一個水炮喎。

221
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:09,760
哇！主席，即係如果第日真係你話喺海上要救援嚇，咁十八隻水晶輪如果少咗，

222
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,810
會唔會可以將呢筆賬算上樑振英頭上去咧？嚇！

223
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,090
嗱，主席，所以咧。

224
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,830
講嘢咧，就唔可以。

225
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,220
講一半。

226
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,080
即係我哋建制派嘅兩位議員咧。

227
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,090
剛才發咗言啦，噉就話咧不合作運動啊嚇拖垮香港啦噉。

228
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:38,450
連嗰十五個團體組成嘅呢一個建造業大聯盟啊，都被我説服。

229
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:53,260
權大啲一個叫梁振英，可以調動以前嗰個叫梁振英，佢就去搞政治鬥爭，就犧牲民生嘅項目，噉啊將個麻袋指向立法會嘅公務小組。

230
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,000
同埋財委會。

231
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,420
因為冇啲荒謬得過噉嘅咧嚇。

232
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:07,720
至於幾兩位同事提過嘅嚇不下數次呢個所謂不合作運動咧，主席，與其你叫佢做不合作運動咧，不如你叫佢做一個運動咧。

233
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,680
係可以突顯梁振英係點樣虛偽咧？

234
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:20,700
如果我哋唔係有呢個運動，我係點樣收到兩封噉嘅信？跟住睇到，哇！佢喺財務委員會可以。

235
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:39,640
當咗呢啲噉嘅畀我哋兩位主席嘅理由咧，係冇到啊，噉啊自己去抽起四個民生項目就為自己呢一個僭建良粉局長工程明鑼開道啫。咁所以我哋嘅不合作運動咧，與其叫做不合作運動咧，不如叫做突顯梁振英虛偽嘅運動。

236
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,340
突顯佢點樣講一套，做一套嘅運動。

237
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,920
凸顯佢點樣犧牲民生嚟做政治鬥爭嘅運動。

238
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,000
可能嚟得更加準確啊，主席。

239
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,500
主席，最後嘅咧，我必須提醒香港市民。

240
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,950
立法會咧係幫大家把關嘅。

241
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:17,820
我哋最近先喺政府集務委員會睇過咧，呢個民航處啊，點樣可以喺民航處長嗰個嗰個辦公室喺個淋浴間啊，喺呢個民航處大樓裏邊整個整個落地玻璃嘅跳舞房啊，要嚟做乜啫？

242
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:38,360
噉我哋就梗係要幫大家睇住呢啲嘢，同埋最近啫嘛，今朝我哋喺人事編制委員會成功地就係令到禁毒專員咧係承諾喺開呢個編外職位三年之內咧唔會搞強制嘅驗毒計劃，只係做研究嗱。

243
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,850
呢個先係正式嘅。

244
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:51,070
立法會點樣同行政機關互動，而係以市民福祉為依歸，最典型嘅範例，簡此陳詞。

245
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,920
財經事務及庫務局局長。

246
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,970
誒主席，首先我要多謝石禮謙議員提出嘅議案，以及啊吳亮星議員啊同埋梁家傑議員提出嘅修正案。

247
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,330
喺聽取議員就呢一次動議辯論發表之前。

248
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,450
誒發表意見之前，我希望先。

249
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:30,930
我希望先多謝立法會秘書處嘅協助，以及各位嘅合作喺本立法年度，我哋已經加開咗不少財務委員會，即係財委會同埋公務小組委員會啊，即係公務小組嘅會議。至今財委會亦通過咗三堆一爐等六個基本工程項目，合共約。

250
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:45,100
約三百億元嘅撥款申請，而公務小組亦已完成審核十個工程項目，當中咧有七項獲得支持，涉及嘅涉及嘅工程撥款咧約為六十四十五億元。

251
00:32:45,870 --> 00:33:01,240
啊！一直以嚟，基本工程對香港嘅經濟同埋社會發展，以及提升市民嘅生活質素等方面咧，係均極有貢獻嘅。政府近年嚟喺公政喺基本工程嘅開支，每年約為七百億元。

252
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,570
基本工程涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括土道路、鐵路。

253
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:15,050
醫院、學校、環境保護及廢物處理設施、土地供應以及供水同埋排水系統等等。

254
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,200
根據世界經濟論壇嘅全球競爭力報告，香港嘅基礎建設。

255
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
在約一百四十個經濟體係中。

256
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,160
喺過去連續五年係居於首位，呢個係令人引以為傲。

257
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:40,080
要提升香港競爭力，持續改善市民嘅居住環境同埋生活質質素，政府係需要繼續投放適量嘅資源嚟推動基本工程計劃。

258
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:50,260
喺二零一二一三年度，財委會一共通過咗三十九個新工程項目，批准工程預算費達九百億元。

259
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:58,650
獲批嘅項目包括興建香港兒童醫院、天水圍醫院、啟德發展區的嘅基礎設施。

260
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:05,150
新界單車徑擴闊道、吐露港公路同埋粉嶺公路等。

261
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,940
各公務局各公公務部門正努力推展啲項目，希望能夠按計劃完成，為市民提供服務。

262
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:24,730
但係咧，喺二零一三一四年度，財委會只係通過咗十三個新工程項目，合共工程預算費僅為三十六億元。

263
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:34,890
以工程預算費計算，上年度財委會通過嘅新工程項目，不及二零一二一三年度嘅百分之五。

264
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:43,420
部分議員喺財委會同埋公務小組拉布，嚴重影響基本工程計劃嘅推展。

265
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:50,460
上年度共有二十七個工程項目受立法會拉布影響而未能完成審批。

266
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,980
呢啲被延誤嘅項目，皆與民生有關，包括三多一路。

267
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,510
為增加長遠土地供應嘅填海計劃研究。

268
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,950
興建學校、體育館、隔音屏障同埋警署等等。

269
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:13,350
拉布令每項工程被延誤超過半年，工程造價合共增加咗二十五億元。

270
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,640
其中，剛獲財委會撥款嘅三堆一爐四個項目嘅工程造價，已合共上升咗十三億元。

271
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:31,610
喺工程時間表方面，有個別項目因為需要重新招標而受到更嚴重嘅延誤，例如佛教醫院翻修工程。

272
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:44,130
而而於屯門公路加建屏音隔音屏障工程已招標，因標書有限期將於本月底屆滿，工程或需要重新招標。

273
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:56,900
事實上，即使個別已招標嘅項目因投票因因投標者同意延長標書有限期而無需重新招標，亦不代表拉布對工程冇影響。

274
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:05,820
一日未取得撥款，工程都唔能夠開展。呢一個係對工程嘅時間表作同埋造價都有負面嘅影響。

275
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,550
有意見認為，政府需要。

276
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:18,850
為項目而唔負責，認為如果政府同意壓後較具爭議性嘅項目，議會便不會進行拉布。

277
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:31,100
事實上，要維持香港嘅長遠競爭力，有七百萬人安居樂業，我哋嘅基本工程計劃一定要多樣化，以滿足香港各方面嘅發展需要。

278
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:45,870
相信大家都明白，我哋不可以只進行學校、醫院等無爭議性等爭議性較少嘅項目，而將例如與土地供應相關嘅項目無限期壓後。

279
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,980
為咗避免爭拗而捨難取易，致香港長遠發展需要，不顧係鈎鳥政策。

280
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:11,000
我哋同意政府喺推展工程時，必須要廣納市民、地區以及議會嘅意見，所以我哋會就工程進行廣泛嘅諮詢，並需要遵守各項法律同埋規劃程序嘅要求，以確保各方意見都能被充分考慮。

281
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:23,550
而事實上，政府部門向公務小組同埋財委會提交公務工程項目之前，都先徵詢區議會同埋相關團體以及立法會有關嘅事務委員會。

282
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:34,600
工程撥款建議係經過充分辯證、修訂、討論，在獲得普遍支持之後，先至提交高務小組同埋財委會審議。

283
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,460
你有意見批評政府不先將與民生有關嘅工程撥款申請？

284
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:57,320
提交立法會審議，其實何為與民生有關呢？舉例嚟講，與中長期土地供應有關嘅項目，往往成為拉布嘅對象，但事實上土地不足已漸漸成為香港持續發展嘅障礙。

285
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:06,680
難道提供更多商住土地，推動經濟發展，增加就業機會，即誒就業機會與民生無關嗎？

286
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:18,560
現時製造、現製誒現時建造價格上升，我哋預期政府工程嘅建造價格喺本喺本年會上升大約百分之六。

287
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:28,070
我哋計劃喺本立法年度向財委會提交嘅八十多個新工程項目嘅撥款申請，總工程造價約為七百億元。

288
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:48,360
如果工程項目未能於本立法年度完結前取得撥款，工程會被延誤，造價亦會增加。儘管財委會同埋公務小組已加開多次會議，但完成審議程、完成審議嘅工程項目嘅數量亦非常有限，進展不容樂觀。

289
00:38:48,380 --> 00:39:00,670
指望將來相關嘅政策局同埋公務部門會繼續與各個區議會同埋立法會議員保持溝通，提供工程項目嘅資料同埋理據，爭取支持。

290
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:08,610
政府衷心希望各位議員能夠把握時間，理性同埋務實咁審議工程撥款提議。

291
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:24,760
令各項市民熱切期待嘅基建同埋社區設施可以及早動工。我喺度先停一停，等聽完啊議員嘅意見之後再做回應。主席，我緊接陳前，多謝。王國興議。

292
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,600
主席。

293
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:49,390
剛才梁家傑議員嘅發言呢，令我非常之憤怒。對梁家悦傑議員嘅説法，我認為佢係顛倒是非、混淆黑白、倒果為因、賊喊捉賊。

294
00:39:49,880 --> 00:40:09,890
佢對於大聯盟接觸佢，強烈要求唔好係再拉布，唔好再搞不合作運動，以香港民生為重。佢就喺呢度斷章取義，話大聯盟咧竟然係贊同佢嘅睇法。

295
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:20,410
我收到大聯盟有關負責人WhatsApp畀我，叫我喺呢個機會去嚴厲譴責梁家傑議員誤導公眾。

296
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,490
主席。

297
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:28,380
我今日個發言係好憤怒，我帶埋個沙煲嚟。

298
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,930
就想話畀公眾知。

299
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,570
而家工程專業界。

300
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,690
面臨就要喺過年之後裁員減薪、掉沙煲。

301
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,230
主席。

302
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:54,680
呢一個圖顯示，二零一二至一三年度政府批出嘅公共工程。

303
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,110
九百億。

304
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,580
呢九百億公唔工程？

305
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,860
都係做私人發展商做唔到嘅嘢，橋、隧道。

306
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,760
醫院、學校，甚至好多嘅專有設施，例如醫院等等。

307
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:22,010
但係二零一三一四年度幾多錢啊？批咗三十六億啊！

308
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,380
除啊！請全港市民睇下。

309
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,950
究竟泛民陣營有冇道理？

310
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:41,920
你反對梁振英咪反咯！你唔好將全港人、全香港市民當為人質嚟去要脅。

311
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,540
你可以求反對票，但係你唔好將你荷包倒掉，係咪啊？

312
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,000
主席。

313
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,190
一年批三啊六億。

314
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,360
係咩嘅後果啊，主席？

315
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,640
二零零三年。

316
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,940
金融危機嘅時候。

317
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:08,250
當時嘅政府都批三至四百億公共工程一年。

318
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,600
當年。

319
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,700
全香港建造業有成七萬幾人失業。

320
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,560
呢個就係零三年嘅情況啦。

321
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,710
但係而家批出三十六億。

322
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,660
比之當年批三四百億一個零頭。

323
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,030
公道自在人心，我想問全香港市民，想問在座各位。

324
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,990
有乜嘢理由可以噉樣啊？

325
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:45,540
就接住呢啲問題。既然黃國興想問在座各位，在座又咁少人，要求點算法定人數？誒，多謝你畀我透。

326
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,110
嗯。

327
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,110
我問你，請佢就翻譯。

328
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,480
主席。

329
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,080
三十六億，大概係十三項工程。

330
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,970
其他咧七八十項，正如頭先局長講，全部冇得做。

331
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:37,370
而家全個建造行業有二十五萬工人、七萬工程師、四萬文職人員。主席，由於只係批出三十六億，本應當係有成係八九百億係不能夠批出七八十項工程。

332
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,930
所以，請你哋睇睇。

333
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:53,350
已經係直接影響所有啲工程項目嘅前期準備、顧問公司研究、規劃、量測量等等各項嘅專業人士。

334
00:56:53,810 --> 00:57:12,900
主席啱啱過咗個禮拜日，建造業議會嘅主席話畀我聽：，過咗年之後，呢啲本來係工程嘅前期嘅各行各業嘅專業人士，就會面臨被裁員、被減薪。

335
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:24,170
接住係咩咧？由於啲工程做唔到，再下一步就影響到建造業嗰二十五萬嘅技術工人。

336
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:30,100
我哋去做再培訓，培訓咗出嚟冇工作。

337
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:43,510
主席，呢一個就係言誤嘅情況，呢一個就係泛民陣營搞不合作運動、犧牲全港市民利益嘅重要嘅證據。

338
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,270
主席。

339
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,370
除咗。

340
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,330
應洗未洗？

341
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:59,670
佢哋拖延就令到我哋納税人，我哋嘅血汗錢被嘥。

342
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,760
呢個年度開始。

343
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,540
陳局長嚟到話畀我哋聽。

344
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:13,390
由於嗰啲工程延誤，令到工程造價係上升二十三億。

345
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:20,460
啱啱幾分鐘之前，陳局長講到上升二十五億。

346
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,630
我而家唔以二十五億嚟計，我以二十三億嚟計。

347
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,270
二十三億差咗我哋幾多錢咧？

348
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:34,310
以我哋最近批出嘅做一個安老院舍，起要六千五百萬。

349
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:43,630
二十三億就可以做三十五間嘅安老院社，每一間係有一百嘅宿位。

350
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,770
泛民陣營正一好話講盡。

351
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:53,590
壞事又做盡，嘥我哋納税人。

352
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:59,190
以局長最新嘅計算，二十五億月掟落鹹水海。

353
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:00,960
主席。

354
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,310
一方面係嘥我哋嘅錢。

355
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:08,320
一方面又令到我哋呢個失業半失業。

356
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:15,290
泛民陣營唔中意梁振英，話佢係小圈子選出嚟，係六八九。

357
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:30,390
但係而家政府政改方案畀全香港市民可以一人一票有選擇去選擇走，你哋又反對，左又反對，右又反對，前又反對，後又反對。

358
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:35,440
你哋正一係反對派，你正一係倒市民嘅米。

359
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,150
主席。

360
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:49,740
我唔會呼籲佢哋手下留情。我已經呼籲多次，冇意義。我呼籲全港市民喺五月之前登記做選民。

361
00:59:50,020 --> 01:00:06,000
你登佢做選民，就運用你神聖嘅權力喺今年區議會選舉、明年立法會選舉選個啲人入立法會、入區議會，噉樣先係辦法。如果唔係，香港玩完。

362
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:08,870
國家奇遇。

363
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,240
主席。

364
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,610
如果啲盲務聽啊，黃國興講咧，都以為係真嘅，主席。

365
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:21,920
我哋呢一個立法會喺呢一度，當然係要做足功課，為個社會去做嘢啦。

366
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,990
頭先吳亮升唔喺度。

367
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:36,550
我而家都想叫佢翻嚟聽，佢做財委會嘅時候，我哋喺未畀佢展報嘅時候，一樣叫政府將一啲民生嘅關乎民生嘅工程拎出嚟。

368
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:42,110
一而再，再而三要求佢調耳情，有冇聽得到？冇。

369
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,980
今年財委會一模一樣。

370
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,940
希望將一啲冇爭議性嘅。

371
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:55,210
同民生有關係嘅學校、醫院，所有嗰啲工程拎出嚟。

372
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,940
政府有冇聽到？

373
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,090
完全唔使聽。

374
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:04,530
誒，國家議員停一停，黃永文議員，請你唔好喺會議廳裏邊。

375
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,200
冇嘢。

376
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,680
黃毓民議員，未係你發言時間。如果你再高聲談話咧～

377
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:17,100
我哋要求你離開會議廳㗎啦！

378
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,010
郭家議員請繼續。主席。

379
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:27,010
我哋見得到呢啲係真係要撥亂反正嘅，亂嘅係呢一度保皇黨建制派。

380
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:34,770
而家我哋講緊啲工程啊，幾百億、幾千億，我先講一個蓮塘口岸。

381
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:55,330
總共咧，主席五百八十億點解要做蓮塘口岸啊？睇翻政府啲文件，話原塘蓮塘口岸咧原本係需要咧係增加多啲人去過關。政府零七年發表嘅二零三零年規劃遠景同埋策略講咗，蓮塘係不宜輕。

382
01:01:55,330 --> 01:02:15,340
興建口岸，因為地地點咧係偏遠，呢個政府嘅文件嚟講嘅，同埋交通流量分析咧，只係有百分之五點三咧係進出東面嘅惠州同埋粵東嘅。一年之後，政府改咗零八年九月，其實咧就係當時深圳市咧就同。

383
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:23,770
政同深圳市規劃局同埋港府規劃處共同發表一個深港蓮塘口岸嘅研早期研究報告。

384
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:41,880
講穿咗，原來又係大陸要我哋做嘅工程㗎。點解咧？因為佢係希望呢個工程令到穿過深圳羅湖市區嘅交通擠塞，咪所謂污染咧減低，希望做到咧就東進東出，西進西出。

385
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:52,220
呢一個基本上唔係為香港而設嘅，無論係經濟又好、民生又好嘅一個工程咧，五百八十億話起就起。

386
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,000
另外，高鐵。

387
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:00,530
到而家咧，大家都見得到，首尾係好長，超支係講緊百幾億。

388
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:05,860
呢一個大家睇到都係一啲大白象嘅工程啦，點樣幫香港嘅市民啊？

389
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,410
而家成個香港逼爆曬自由行。

390
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:18,760
市民要行出去，金鐘要坐咩？局長講得好風涼啊！一輛轉車，五轉車都上唔到。

391
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,800
所有嘅。

392
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:35,820
住喺北區嘅，而家去到元朗、屯門，甚至去到天水圍咧，都係被一啲自由行去影響。香港人咧就要找數，仲要用幾百億嘅錢引多啲自由行嚟，點解要咁做咧？

393
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:44,380
喺呢個議會入邊，無論財委會又好，公務工程，所有同民生有關嘅民主派嘅議員，不但只唔唔會。

394
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,120
係會反對，我哋拎埋出嚟要求調個議程。

395
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,580
有冇肯啊？完全唔肯。

396
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,160
政府咧。

397
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,260
係拆喊捉賊。

398
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:15,140
財委會之前話要調議程，喺三堆一爐之前、富有爭議性之前嘅個個議議案過之前咧，係要將一啲民生嘅拎出嚟。政府咧當時就話唔得，冇不冇迫切性，又唔係工程合約嘅問題。好啦，到而家啦，要夾硬嚟，要過呢一。

399
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:28,850
個科技局啦，又可以將四個，其中兩個係同學校有關嘅，同學校科技有關嘅，踢走佢，水炮踢走佢，消防裝備踢踢走佢，為咗咩嘢啫？

400
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:35,150
梁振英因為要講個要做呢個科技局，要鬥氣同全香港市民鬥氣啊嘛！

401
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,920
王國興咧，頭先咧又講大話。

402
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:45,260
我哋唔會，絕對唔會因為呢啲工程嘅延誤係令到多啲人失業失業。不過咧。

403
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:52,050
可能咧就工聯會都要諗清楚，政府而家夾硬做呢一啲咁多大白仗工程。

404
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:55,780
跟住已經講緊係點啊！要輸入愛路啦。

405
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:08,720
點樣可以令到嗰啲基層嗰啲人咧係分分到一啲利益啊？梗係冇啦！我唔知佢用個腦去諗啲咩嘢嚇。事實上呢一啲噉嘅工程，無論高鐵，

406
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:29,010
而家加埋呢個蓮塘口岸，仲有咧呢個嚟緊嘅啦，港珠澳大橋連接口岸啦，仲有人工島啲啲咧。其實大部分同民生咧係冇關係，好多係好有爭議，亦都好多咧係得唔到社會嘅認同嘅。立法會議員嘅責任就喺呢一度。

407
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,360
唔希望政府大花童亂咁使錢啊嘛！

408
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:43,790
我哋講咗好耐，講到口水都幹。所有啲醫院嘅重建嘅計劃，要佢做快啲，唔會做；要起醫院唔做，起學校唔起。

409
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,320
老人中心遲啲拖得就拖。

410
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:51,160
有曬所有嘅文件喺度，有曬所有嘅證據㗎。

411
01:05:51,440 --> 01:06:00,080
擘大眼，唔好係畀一啲黃國興之流呢一類人咧亂噏。當然，我亦都同意嘅，鼓勵多啲市民。

412
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:18,060
今年要登記做選民，特別喺雨傘之後，我哋需要多啲人出嚟擘大隻眼睇清楚，佢哋保皇黨係講啲咩嘢，係點樣令到呢個政府一啲完全同民生作對嘅建設都可以拎出嚟夾硬過。

413
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:24,560
踢走保皇黨，踢走呢個建制派，肯定香港人嚟緊一年最重要嘅目的。

414
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,550
講翻今次呢個議案咧。

415
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,180
梁家傑。

416
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,880
佢作為。

417
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:41,740
公務工程委員會嘅主席，佢都受咗好多氣，因為事實上咧，有好多個工程同政府講，可唔可以拎出嚟攞攞早少少，冇得傾。

418
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:51,180
局長又好，建制派又好，喺呢一度咧，其實做所有嘅嘢咧，或者好多嘅嘢都係與民為敵嘅。

419
01:06:52,330 --> 01:07:00,870
政府係欠市民一個好多嘅交代，呢幾百億、幾千億，主席，而家我哋簽咗落去三千八百幾億。

420
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,240
用咩找數咧？原來而家用個基本工程。

421
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,570
基金。

422
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,950
賣地得翻嚟嘅錢，即係我哋啲地咧，一定要賣到更加貴。

423
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:32,450
儲多啲錢，儲夠八千幾億走呢一條數，因為嚟緊而家有八千幾億，包括啲大白象嘅工程、人工島、冇米竹等等。第三跑道呢一啲都係要全港市民去去做，去畀呢一啲錢，繼續高地價政策，賣多啲貴地，攞多啲錢，起多啲大白象工程。

424
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,050
本人僅此陳辭，多謝主席。

425
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,380
主席。

426
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:56,690
所謂審批基建項目撥款進度緩慢係一個偽命題，不過就由呢個石禮謙提出，亦都畀個機會咧。呢度正反雙方、反對派同建制派可以唇槍舌劍一番。所以今日呢一個議程咧，我諗都有排拖㗎啦。雖然啲人未落嚟。

427
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,590
聽到唔啱，聽又落嚟講幾句嚇。

428
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,140
主席。

429
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:10,370
孔夫子話：，其身正，不令而行；，其身不正，雖令不從。

430
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,200
十六個字係好清楚㗎啦。

431
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:20,890
港共政權，佢何曾有顧及大多數市民嘅感受？

432
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:26,930
任何嘅政策制定又有幾時聽過市民嘅意見咧？你話畀我聽，係咪？

433
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:38,640
施政失誤，民怨沸騰，從冇半點自省，歉然不足。反過嚟要指責立法會嘅代議事。

434
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,130
呢啲又叫拆喊捉拆。

435
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:47,480
連所謂做過教授學者嘅陳家強，今日都喺度溜打，你都算新狠。

436
01:08:48,380 --> 01:09:00,830
港共政權屢次發展提高競爭力為名，無視所有嘅反對意見，將嗰啲意見者打壓成妨礙香港發展嘅罪人，合理化自身粗暴嘅決定。

437
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:21,270
舉個例，石禮謙喺度。二零零七年，民航署向立法會申請撥款三十幾億，更換空管系統同埋興建新總部大樓，以強化香港亞太航運樞紐嘅地位，並且提高香港機場嘅競爭力。當時嘅財委會迅速地通。

438
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,420
個撥款。

439
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:40,720
以支持香港鞏固航空樞紐地位，阿教授，但係民航處竟然採用先平後貴嘅事後更改合約方式，矇騙呢個物流處，多番維護中標商嘅權益，令到香港嘅利益受損。

440
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:52,710
而興建新嘅行呢個民航處總部，就更改原來嘅面積分配列表，喺處長辦公室興建二百尺豪華浴室、卡拉OK房、跳舞房。

441
01:09:52,990 --> 01:10:03,150
立法會嘅職能啊，就係監察政府基建項目嘅撥款要行公量直，杜絕舞弊同埋以權謀私啊，局長！

442
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:07,820
新緊呢個例子已經説明一切啦！咩基建項目啊？

443
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,780
喺度掠水啊嘛！

444
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:17,700
頭先呢個黃國興講到振振有詞，有幾多億又起幾多院舍，有起咩？你哋？

445
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:31,450
又係審計處個報告講呢個長期護理，每年五千幾人排隊等唔切上天堂，都冇你個縮位，同呢個基建項目審批緩慢有關咩？唔通？

446
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,790
垃圾一大堆呢度。

447
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:42,430
我話畀人咬你實唔夠我咬嘅，講就講，唔唔唔，你要講數字講理據，我大把到後輩我都識。

448
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:51,880
類似嘅事件係不勝枚舉，申請撥款嘅時候就好話説盡，畀咗錢你就壞事做盡。

449
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:52,970
係嘛？

450
01:10:53,250 --> 01:11:00,980
二零一零年嘅高鐵事件，強行將總站設喺西九，短短二十六公里嘅路程，竟然畀台灣四百多公。

451
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:11,130
你嘅高鐵造價仲要貴啊！而且咧，仲要係英法五十公里海底高鐵隧道造價嘅三倍。

452
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,400
而家仲要缺乏工程人員。

453
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:21,740
超支嘅費用，仿似無底深潭，邊個畀啊？你陳家強自己攞錢畀啊？

454
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,690
我哋納税人嘅錢，市民嘅用錢，呢啲你唔講。

455
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:40,400
政府劣跡斑斑，每次都係虎頭蛇尾，憑咩叫香港人仲相信你好專業、公正地去執行呢啲所謂基建項目咩？

456
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:47,140
立法會今天出現噉嘅情況，甚至有人認為係空轉，係邊個造成嘅？

457
01:11:47,420 --> 01:12:01,560
你個政府有咩認受性啊？有咩民意基礎啊？梁振英做咗兩年半，天怒人怨，七十九日嘅佔領運動係嘛？警察變咗惡警，變咗黑警，邊個造成啊？

458
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,290
係有權力嘅人造成，唔係我哋呢啲咁卑微嘅民意代表所造成。

459
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:14,580
你要同公眾講，我而家話畀公眾聽，冇人會怪罪我哋呢啲權力薄弱。

460
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:26,660
係咪啊？嘅民意代表，我哋只會不屑嗰啲係民意代表嘅直選議員建制派為虎作倀。

461
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,920
同政府狼狽為奸，沆瀣一氣。

462
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:38,060
美國已故嘅作家馬克吐温曾經講過。

463
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:58,900
讓我哋陷入困境嘅唔係無知，而係看似正確嘅謬誤論斷。今天港共政權同啲建制派就為呢一句説話做咗最好嘅注腳。另外一位好有智慧、唔使做嘢嘅美國前總統羅魯列根。

464
01:12:58,900 --> 01:12:59,960
講嗰句説話。

465
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:07,060
政府並不是解決問題的方法，政府本身才是問題之所在。

466
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,330
今天嘅特區政府。

467
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:11,800
就係問題之所在。

468
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:18,540
香港人真係天可憐見，係冇辦法去推翻一個噉嘅政府。

469
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:23,540
今天你哋仲會聽共產黨嘅説話？

470
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,700
去壓迫香港嘅人民。

471
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:32,020
講下民族自決，又扣一大頂港獨嘅帽子。

472
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,950
係嘛？爭在未捉曬啲人去槍斃嘅啫。

473
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,250
民主就是要有反對的自由。

474
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:45,810
作為反對派，就一定係以否定為肯定，為反對而反對。

475
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,840
你講得啱啊！唔通我為贊成而反對啊？我做咩反對派啊？

476
01:13:52,280 --> 01:14:11,260
嗰個真理先要會越變越明啊嘛，就係以否定為肯定，為反對而反對，係任何一個國家嘅反對派嘅應有之義嚟㗎嘛。噉你先揾得出政府缺點啊嘛，而係保障人民嘅權益啊嘛。呢個常識嚟㗎，有冇讀有冇讀書啊？你哋？

477
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,830
我講嘢都好大聲，黃國興都好大聲。

478
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:22,640
大聲都有料先得嘅，大佬講嚟講去三幅皮，係咪啊？

479
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:30,470
確保行政機關嘅施政決策過程公平、公正、公開，係代議士嘅責任。

480
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:37,060
我哋對政府任何嘅行為，都要係不疑處有疑。

481
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,620
喺絕無懷疑嘅地方，都要懷疑你㗎啦。

482
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,580
楊繼昌議員。

483
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:56,410
多謝主席，和謝謝阿布雷姆謝克先生提出這個動議辯論，關心關於問題的緩慢進展和未能改善，撥款申請的申請人基礎設施項目。

484
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:07,470
但係，我諗，主席，我唔能夠同意謝克的動議，因為根本上，我認為，從理論上講，謝克的動議是錯誤的。

485
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:20,500
first of all, in the fourth line of his motion, it says infrastructure works will definitely be delayed, thereby pushing up works costs and affecting the livelihood practitioners.

486
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:25,530
Now, I just have one question for Mr. Shack.

487
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:40,540
The pushing up the cost is it because of the delay, or is it because of the excessive demand? Because of the over concentration of work carried out during the period, which shot up the price of material or labour.

488
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:53,430
If I'm just a first-year economic student, I would say because of the excessive demand on a limited supply, then naturally the cost of labour will shoot up, and not because of the delay.

489
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,430
And my second big question, Mr. President, on this motion is.

490
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,680
On.

491
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:22,010
The industry sustainability and eventually hindering Hong Kong's long-term economic development, and also because of the speed of approving the funding application, Mrs. Chek also talk about the livelihood of the industry as a whole. This begs the question: what

492
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:42,020
是The purpose of you know launching these infrastructure project. Not to mention, we haven't defined the term infrastructure yet. What is infrastructure? But before we go down to the definition of infrastructure, I think per se, the building of roads, bridges and other facilities is

493
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:54,620
Not to make the industry sustainable, because all these infrastructures are capital stocks of society, and these stocks must produce utility.

494
01:16:54,910 --> 01:17:03,640
And not per se to provide employment, because we are not in an economic downturn. Of course, when you use the Keynesian theory.

495
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:11,420
building of infrastructure will increase employment, will generate you know GDP, will have a multiply effect.

496
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,920
我賠個 pardon，但。

497
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:22,720
現代經濟學家fail to agree on this point. This is fundamental, of course, but this is a theory coming from 1930 general theory of Keynes.

498
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,800
If we want to stimulate economic recovery.

499
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:36,300
Both fiscal policy and monetary policy to be used, but in Hong Kong in 2005, we are not in an economic depression.

500
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,090
No.

501
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,390
Let's go down to the more basics.

502
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,230
What utility do we have?

503
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:52,850
If we are building more railways, more tunnels, more roads, of course, yes. The only word we can find is connectivity.

504
01:17:53,130 --> 01:18:00,080
但，什麼是連通性無其他種類的經濟活動？

505
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,960
你唔可以 convince me，因為。

506
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:09,280
There is and there must be a saturation point of infrastructure.

507
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,620
在一個地方，只有一千平方公尺。

508
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:32,220
但，ironically, Mr. President, when I speak to a very senior civil engineer a couple of days ago, I said and asked his expert opinion, Mr. Engineer, do you think there would be a saturation point for infrastructure? He said no, because he said.

509
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:41,670
When infrastructure became old, no matter they're still usable or not, we will tear them down and will build more, newer, bigger, more sophisticated infrastructure.

510
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,910
先生，我唔諗呢個係正確嘅態度。

511
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:59,470
第三個問題，什麼是Infrastructure？Without even defining the word Infrastructure， we are just debating for for for the past two hours. I think I'm a bit ridiculous and superficial.

512
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:06,750
Now, I've recently read a paper prepared by the U.S. Congressional Research Service.

513
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:13,980
The title of that paper read: The role of public works infrastructure in economic recovery.

514
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:20,560
Now, what is infrastructure? Is that there's no standard or agreed definition of the term.

515
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:27,040
and the policy concept, the concept in policy terms, has been and remain fluid.

516
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:30,070
and this may include.

517
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:42,030
The infrastructure which common people understand—roads, bridges, water, sewage system, airports, public building. This is a more narrow definition of infrastructure.

518
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:48,530
And a wider definition of infrastructure, Mr. President, it also includes school, health facilities.

519
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:52,180
recreation facilities, electric power production.

520
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:56,050
廢 disposal and telecommunication facilities.

521
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:07,380
但也是最近，主席，有個相對較近的添加到討論關於定義基礎設施。

522
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:12,300
And，that concept is called green infrastructure.

523
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,140
And what is green infrastructure?

524
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,660
綠色 infrastructur

525
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:27,560
是概念，of growing the economy and creating jobs with investment that will promote clean energy and environmental protection.

526
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:39,100
先生，即使不論是否有必要進入細節，問 filibustering 是否或確實延遲了基礎設施的資金撥款過程。

527
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:49,400
我會説，我會非常 sceptical if I were being, you know, faced with a daunting task of approving a multi-billion dollar road or tunnel project.

528
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,740
因為。

529
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,270
Of the reason I've stated.

530
01:20:53,790 --> 01:21:13,250
我當然支持更廣泛的基礎設施，包括綠色基礎設施項目，而這是我們必須盡職盡責監督所有項目的原因。這些項目必須產生益處給社區、給市民。

531
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:16,580
and in fact, nobody can ask me this question.

532
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,450
maybe perhaps。

533
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:30,390
The secretary, Professor Chen, you can answer me. I want to find out multiply index, the fiscal multiply index for infrastructure projects in Hong Kong, but I could not find this index.

534
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,900
我哋唔會膽敢話。

535
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:41,830
The multiply effect of cutting tax or dishing out cash to all the citizens, Hong Kong, will have the same multiply effect.

536
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:46,050
as the increase in government fiscal spending.

537
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,570
Mr. Preston，我 rest my case。Thank you。

538
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,150
挪威國語。

539
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,450
主席。

540
01:21:53,730 --> 01:22:03,420
本人首先多謝石禮謙議員動議嘅原議案，畀大家可以一起探討呢一個關係到香港經濟發展同埋社會民生嘅重要議題。

541
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:11,460
立法會部分議員發起嘅拉布戰同埋不合作運動咧，已經嚴重咁影響新工程項目嘅審批。

542
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:27,020
根據立法會財務委員會審議項目嘅統計，二零一三至一四年度原預計新工程撥款總額係四百三十一億元，但係實際新工程批准嘅撥款總額咧只有三十六億元。

543
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:34,990
相對於二零一一年到一二同埋二零一二到一三年度嘅新工程批准嘅總額。

544
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:39,710
一千零一千六百零七億，同埋九百零九億。

545
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,530
係大幅鋭減。

546
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:47,750
甚至比沙士期間所批出嘅新工程撥款二百二十億咧，仲要少。

547
01:22:48,240 --> 01:23:05,860
工程建造業界係非常擔憂，十多個建造業嘅商會、工會同埋專業學會喺十一月底成立咗建造業大聯盟，促請立法會議員咧係履行職責，從速停止拉布。我同埋石禮謙議員咧係都係大聯盟嘅成員。

548
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:15,200
工程撥款誤誤，除咗令到建造工程成本上升、浪費公帑之外，亦都嚴重影響從業員嘅生計。

549
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:34,900
目前本港正行正在進行多項嘅大型基建同埋屋宇建造等嘅工程，造成建造業工人嘅需求增加，人手係顯得相當嘅緊缺。香港建造業商會同埋香港基建工程商聯會喺去年十一月咧，係到會員嘅地盤進行調查。

550
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:41,310
發現兩方面嘅人手分別係欠缺三千三百多人同埋一千五百多人。

551
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:51,110
據此推算咧，全港欠缺咧，大約係一萬二千五百名建築工人，同埋大約係四千六百多名機電工程工人。

552
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:58,250
不過，業界朋友、同事亦都指出，由於政治爭拗影響咗基建工程嘅規劃。

553
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:05,840
今年至到明年，多項大型工程咧，係同時達到施工嘅高峯期，造成人手嘅嚴重短缺。

554
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:21,600
但係，如果下一批工程未能夠及時推出，就會出現另一個極端，工程量不足，嚴重影響三十六萬建造業從業員嘅生計，導致業界一時飽死，一時餓死。

555
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:28,140
業界估計，每年政府喺公共工程嘅開支咧，要達到七百億元以上。

556
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:37,270
連同私人項目兩方面合計咧，大約係一千八百億業界嘅生計同埋發展咧，先能夠持續。

557
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:49,150
建造業大聯盟估計，如果建造業嘅失業率係回升到二零零三年嘅百分之十九，就會有將近七萬多名嘅從業員失業。

558
01:24:50,430 --> 01:25:10,440
高前撥款嘅疑問，亦都會對行業嘅持續性造成嚴重影響。一方面，業界約有一半工人嘅年齡咧係高於五十歲，而培訓新學徒咧就成為熟練工人需時五至六年。若果工程量喺未來數年大減，不但現有工人冇，

559
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:17,260
飯開而被逼轉行，行業嘅前景不明咧，更會令到本來有意入行嘅年輕人咧腳步。

560
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:22,170
多年來嘅培訓工作將會付諸流水。另一方面，

561
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:41,810
建造業界有好多中產專業人士，包括工程師、測量師、工程監督人員等。若果未來嘅工程量大減，引發大量嘅資深專業人員流失，而且一去冇回頭。即使日後各項工程再上馬，業界亦都會因人手不足而出現真空期。

562
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:53,840
此外，政府對住地盤人員嘅待遇係設有限制嘅。若果超過一年未有受聘於政府工程咧，在受聘嘅時候咧，會當作新人入職。

563
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:01,440
由於職由該職位嘅起薪點咧，係重新計算薪酬同埋福利，變相就係大幅減薪。

564
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:20,620
將會迫使一啲資深嘅專業人士係無奈轉行，勞工流失亦都會導致工人為追上完工日期而被迫加班趕工，引發工傷意外等職業安全嘅問題，嚴重影響工程嘅質素。長遠更加會導致香港建造業嘅競爭力下降。

565
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:42,040
主席，正如梁家傑議員嘅修正議案嘅措辭顯示咧，泛民嘅議員一方面係質疑政府類似罔顧民意，硬推爭議性較大嘅基建工項目；另一方面咧就主張本會優先審批有關民生嘅項目撥款申請。

566
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,880
建造業大聯盟認為呢啲説法係此事而非混淆視聽。

567
01:26:47,270 --> 01:27:07,280
事實上，基建工程項目咧都係有關民生嘅，而且與本港嘅長遠經濟發展息息相關。喺項目動工期間，可以直接增加就業機會；喺項目完工之後，又可以促使各行各業嘅發展。如果各類公共設施同埋基礎建設，因為工程撥款而

568
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:14,090
誤以延遲落成，必將獲及房屋供應同埋交通運輸等規劃嘅如期落實。

569
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,740
直接影響社會民生。

570
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:32,380
至於所謂爭議性較大或者較少咧，亦都難免引發更多嘅爭議，因為不同性質嘅大、中、小同埋長、中、短期嘅工程項目有不同方面嘅社會影響，但係可能係同樣迫切。

571
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:39,330
事實上，一啲外界原本以為較少爭議嘅撥款項目咧，最終咧就大受反對。

572
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:55,290
例如，有關新界東北發展嘅研究已經開展咗十多年，亦都喺二零零七年咧係列入十大基建項目，並且分開三個階段進行公眾諮詢。多年來社會嘅意見咧係唔算有嚴重嘅分歧。

573
01:27:55,900 --> 01:28:05,600
起料咧，去年財委會審議新界東北發展區嘅前期撥款申請咧，就成為攻擊目標，以致發生衝擊立法會事件。

574
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:22,210
最後，本人亦都促請政府當局喺規劃基建項目嘅時候，對於建築工程等不同專業嘅人力資源嘅需求咧，係作出相應嘅資源配置，包括增加相關專業職係公務員嘅編制。

575
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:36,390
確保基建項目咧係妥善落實，並且係提升規劃同埋監管嘅水平，切實回應業界嘅訴求同埋社會大眾嘅關注。主席，本人緊此陳辭，支持石禮謙議員嘅動議。

576
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,090
廖長光如。

577
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:46,530
主席，今日嘅議案係關於立法會審批基建項目撥款申請進度緩慢嘅問題。

578
01:28:47,040 --> 01:29:01,310
其實社會大眾見到而家嘅議會，因為部分議員嘅不合作運動而頻臨壟壇緩狀態，積壓大量嘅撥款申請，大家都係既心急又無奈嘅。

579
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,210
正如原議案同埋修正案指出。

580
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,850
呢個問題僵持不下，不但會影響民生。

581
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:15,730
更會令到重要嘅基建工程延誤，工程開支遞增。

582
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:19,970
社會發展停滯，同埋妨礙社會有效施政。

583
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:27,830
為香港嘅經濟同埋整體社會嘅發展咧，帶嚟好多深遠而負面嘅影響。

584
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:38,420
更何況，我哋而家講嘅係一個非常之嚴肅嘅問題，佢仲關係到更高層次嘅議會憲制責任嘅問題。

585
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:43,470
根據基本法第七十三條，立法會有好多重要嘅職能。

586
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:51,260
包括一根據基本法規定，並依照法定程序制定、修改同埋廢除法律。

587
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,140
而根據政府嘅提案審核通過財政預算。

588
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:59,630
三批准税收同埋公共開支。

589
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:04,380
四聽取行政長官嘅施政報告，並進行辯論。

590
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:08,950
五對政府嘅工作提出質詢，等等。

591
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:13,330
呢啲都係涉及公眾利益嘅重要憲制責任。

592
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:18,490
並唔係進行抵制政府嘅政治工具。

593
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:25,570
而家咧就被部分議員咧當為一個脅迫政府嘅手段。

594
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:28,210
去爭取佢哋嘅政治訴求。

595
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:35,000
佢哋採取咗唔同嘅手段嚟阻延議會嘅順利進行。

596
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,720
包括提出大量瑣碎無聊嘅修正案或者動議。

597
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,430
不斷要求點算開會嘅議員人數、擁場發言等等。

598
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:48,560
以求達到向政府施壓嘅目的。

599
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:51,310
有議員話：佢哋拉布。

600
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:55,590
係因為政府提出嘅項目好具爭議性。

601
01:30:55,870 --> 01:31:00,360
所以要用非常嘅手段嚟監督政府使用公帑。

602
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:11,230
亦都有議員話：佢哋嘅質詢唔係拉布，但係只係佢哋只係行使議員最基本嘅提案權同埋質詢權。

603
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:17,340
主席，冇人會質疑議員行使憲制權力嘅自由。

604
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,190
但係佢哋嘅行動嘅顯示咧。

605
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:26,610
以上嗰啲咧，都係一啲自欺欺人嘅説法，係呃唔到市民大眾。

606
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:36,210
亦都有人講，外地議會都有拉布，對此我有兩點回應。第一，外國議會唔會無休止咁拉布。

607
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:42,970
而且到最終，議員都會以民意同埋社會嘅整體利益為依歸。

608
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:48,460
第二，外國雖然有拉布，但係亦都有剪布機制。

609
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:56,680
我並唔接受，只需要數名議員就可藉拉布而壆瞞議會履行憲制職能嘅舉措。

610
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:04,660
現時所見被拉布嘅議案，並唔限於嗰啲具重大爭議性嘅議案項目。

611
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:07,250
噉樣濫用拉布嘅後果係。

612
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:15,230
無論你係幾咁有理據，係幾咁有見地，咁行使你嘅提案權同埋質詢權。

613
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:25,680
都會被淹沒，淹沒喺排山倒海嘅拉布動議同埋表決動議程序當中，根本就無法進行實質嘅辯論。

614
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:36,320
而因為缺乏實質理性嘅辯論，市民亦都根本無法得知你質疑嘅理據係乜嘢，確實反對係乜嘢。

615
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:42,430
其他議員即使係有正常嘅疑問想提出，亦都會望而卻步。

616
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:53,910
結果就係市民只係聽到議會內嘅嘈吵聲音，但係就聽唔到任何理性嘅討論，反而係削弱咗議會監察政府嘅功能。

617
01:32:54,710 --> 01:33:00,200
更何況你噉樣長年累月咁濫用拉布，社會習以為常。

618
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:10,500
議會內外都唔會有人認真看待你嘅訴求，咁噉樣嘅議會運作方式，市民可以為市民帶嚟咩好處呢？

619
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:17,190
反而佢就一而再，再而三噉，將社會帶進危機。

620
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:25,130
主席喺近兩年喺議會審議預算案時，拉布咧，都將香港咧拉向財政懸崖。

621
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:36,010
大家都應該仲記得，舊年嘅撥款條例草案喺六月四號先至獲得通過，比五月中呢條死線延咗三個星期。

622
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:43,180
臨時撥款咧已經唔夠支付五月後嘅公共開支，喺社會上造成一片恐慌。

623
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:58,670
政府仲率先暫緩向醫管局、立法會同埋高等院校發放六月份嘅撥款，要佢哋動用本身嘅儲備應急。聽聞醫管局咧就曾經考慮要變賣資產嚟應急。

624
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:02,850
今年嘅預算案好快就會提交上立法會。

625
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:07,310
我哋係咪又要市民大眾食驚風散？

626
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:10,320
主席道理好簡單。

627
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,380
拉布呢種玉石區分嘅策略。

628
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,150
唔會有贏家，只有輸家。

629
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:24,470
大家都知道，僵持落去，立法會只係一困喺一個死衚衕裏邊，睇唔到出路，係絕非香港之福。

630
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:31,100
主席，基於上述嘅原因，我會支持石禮謙議員嘅原議案。

631
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,780
同埋吳亮星議員嘅修正案。

632
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:48,760
嗱，梁家傑議員嘅修正案咧，只係指責政府，而且有誤導成分，誤導人以為只需要調撥撥款項目嘅次序咧就可以解決問題，我係唔能夠支持嘅。主席，謹此陳辭。

633
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,790
田德俊二。

634
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,190
主席。

635
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:57,620
我相信商界同自由黨。

636
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:03,930
都係非常關心呢幾年喺誒梁振英作為特首之後。

637
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:06,320
而家香港嘅管治問題。

638
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:10,360
因為從商界嗰度講基建嘅。

639
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,940
興建。

640
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,320
係非常之重要嘅一環。

641
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,060
民生嗰一環，當然都緊要。

642
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:21,830
但係，如果好多硬件喺香港係起唔到嘅。

643
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:26,890
自自然然，工商界喺香港發展嘅潛力就會得越嚟越少。

644
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,930
如果我哋睇一睇呢幾年嚟，從上海嘅自由貿易區，

645
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:33,820
或者深圳。

646
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:36,520
嘅前海嘅發展。

647
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,170
我哋而家香港真係停滯咗好多事情，係做唔到。

648
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,620
咁商界冇得投資。

649
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,670
就唔好話撤資呢個字咁難聽啦！你冇投資嘅機會，咪只可以第二度做咯。

650
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,450
咁最終受害嘅就唔淨止係。

651
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:56,920
工程師冇公開，或者建造工人冇公開。

652
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,970
而係成個社會上整體嘅商業運作、經濟嘅發展啊！

653
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,540
係受到損害嘅。

654
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:14,200
咁跟住我都見到嘅咧，就係政府嘅財政收入，若干年後，因為我哋嘅基建發展被拖拉慢咗，而引致。

655
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,790
嘅後遺症咧。

656
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:17,260
就一定係。

657
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:24,670
市民開始係其他嗰啲就業機會又好，晉升機會又好，多啲行業。

658
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,120
嘅升職又好咧，都會可以。

659
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,210
見到嘅。

660
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:37,880
咁石議員今日呢個議案就純粹針對嗰個基建嘅建設，咁即係盧偉國議員都講咗啦。

661
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:44,970
自由都留意到，譬如呢幾年個工程嘅撥款，二零一一年咧係一千六百億嘅。

662
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,820
一二一三咧係九百億嘅。

663
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,840
二零一三一四。

664
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:53,350
用咗嘅得三十六億。

665
01:36:54,250 --> 01:37:01,030
個細節咧就話申請四百三十億三十九個項目咧，批咗得十三個項目。

666
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,720
得三十六億。

667
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:07,100
如果噉樣樣講法，就好多工程上唔到馬。

668
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:11,300
係咪淨係擔心工程師冇工做？就一件事。

669
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,920
但係呢啲工程全部唔上馬。

670
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,180
香港嘅經濟發展一定受到阻礙嘅。

671
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:29,710
咁當然，另外一邊勞工界議員又唔啱聽嘅，就係話：如果呢啲上曬馬，我哋夠唔夠工人起咧？你睇，我哋就係港鐵嘅言，當然係有啲痕跡。

672
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:34,200
而造成嘅問題，但其中只一個問題，亦都係唔夠引起嘅。

673
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:37,690
咁變咗又冇人喺呢邊咧。

674
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,790
個撥款又過唔到。

675
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:44,070
噉，我覺得呢個真係值得關心嘅問題。

676
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:52,060
但我哋都留意到，而家點處理呢個？睇落去係一個基建撥款審批嘅過程。

677
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:57,010
其實咧嘅解決嘅問題就係一個政治嘅問題。

678
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,020
其他同事都留意到。

679
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:00,440
有啲咧。

680
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,270
建制派嘅。

681
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:04,230
就可以壞泛民。

682
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:08,010
不合作運動喺度拉布，累到呢啲過唔到。

683
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,950
泛民嗰啲係調轉頭拗，唯一係政府唔採佢哋。

684
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:16,510
佢哋嘅被逼就不合作運動，由財政府。

685
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,920
自由黨一直主張。

686
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,570
為咗香港嘅整體利益。

687
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,080
政府又應該同泛民傾。

688
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,850
泛民，你哋全部都係選舉產生嘅議員，功能組別同埋直選都係。

689
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:32,420
你都要為市民做啲嘢，就都要同政府傾。

690
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:47,170
而家你哋兩個扯到咁行，即係政府就唔肯採泛民，泛民又唔肯採政府，建制派嘅議員都好難做啊！企喺度同你哋拉布，但係呢啲係一件事，但係所有啲基建工程。

691
01:38:47,450 --> 01:39:07,460
全部晾曬起嚟。若干年後，當然好多議員可能退咗休，但係香港整體嘅經濟嘅損失就唔係咁容易啊！一兩年嚟追翻你。我哋唔通真係希望呢方面啊，香港五十年不變，等內地嘅發展一直咁不斷地的爬。

692
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:19,450
香港一頭噉，香港將嚟我哋啲後生仔嘅晉升機會有喺邊度咧？唔通香港啲工程師係香港啲工程唔上馬，全部走曬去內地去起內地啲工程咩？

693
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:21,720
我哋唔想見到噉嘅情況。

694
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,400
所以我覺得而家呢個管治嘅問題咧。

695
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:30,090
啊！當然，如果我哋時時話叫行政長官、政府先伸出個手。

696
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:31,950
佢哋泛民。

697
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:39,750
又唔肯接你嘅手，凡民應該伸出嘅手咧，我就希望佢哋兩個啊都要各讓一步。

698
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:46,270
啊！政府到呢幾年嚟，除咗我哋留意到喺事務委員會。

699
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:48,270
過冷河嗰陣時。

700
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:59,520
有好多項目係匆匆嘅過咗去，泛民唔滿意，或者係條例草案所有審議啲嘢，泛民啲意見咧，佢哋全部都唔係點接納。

701
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:16,280
咁當然啦，啲政改係可能最後所發生嘅事，或者佔中，但係其他啲嘢全部累積咗咁耐嘅所謂大家唔傾偈、唔協商，而引致今日嘅局面嘅。咁當然現屆政府仲有兩年幾。

702
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,580
如果繼續咁落去咧，我哋作為建制派嘅議員，就喺度陪讀書，日日喺度捱時間。

703
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:41,340
泛民咧會唔會都喺二零一六嘅立法會選舉或者二零一五嘅區議會選舉，市民嘅表態係點咧？而家真係好難評估。我覺得市民如果睇清楚呢件事咧，覺得雙方都有責嘅，即係政府有責任。

704
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:42,870
泛民。

705
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,280
啲議員又有責任。

706
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:50,360
但係，無論點講，而家我哋經建不斷地的被拖後。

707
01:40:50,750 --> 01:41:05,770
啲嘢上唔到馬，將嚟起唔好。有啲可能都唔關呢個基建嘅事啦。商界都好關心，譬如而家個西九嗰塊地，講咗幾多年咧？回歸之前講咗十七年啦，仲係嗰塊地喺度。

708
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:23,770
起得機場，起咗個遊輪碼頭，其他啲嘢又擺曬喺度，唔使講到天花龍鳳嗰啲咩新界東北啊，咩去港珠澳大橋去第二度啊，誒或者啲停車場點處理啊？喺新界東北嗰啲項目啦，就係兩塊而家喺度嘅嘢都開唔到。

709
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:33,690
工，噉我覺得呢個對香港整體嚟講，唔淨止係商界，我覺得對我哋整體嘅發展啊，係造成好長遠嘅打擊。

710
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:45,370
如果泛民可以同政府合作啲，如果政府啊當然唔關陳家強局長嘅事啊。如果嗰啲老闆肯同泛民合作啲嘅話咧，係我哋想見到嘅事情。多謝朱政。

711
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,030
即係話風雨。

712
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:49,990
多謝主席。

713
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,060
接上翻唔同嘅語言。

714
01:41:53,340 --> 01:42:00,380
去去年發起不合作嘅運動以來咧，喺立法會發起連串嘅拉布行動，連。

715
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:18,410
大個財務委員會審批撥款嘅進度亦都大受影響，政府嘅工程項目進度大大落後。除咗嚴重削弱我哋競爭力之外咧，並令納税人因而承擔額外數於十億界嘅呢個建築費。

716
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:26,990
還會造成我哋好多無形嘅損失，故此本人全力支持謝禮謙議員今日提出關注。

717
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:40,740
審批基建項目罰款申請進度緩慢嘅議案，希望大家能夠正視呢個問題，並請泛民議員及早回頭，立即停止拉布。

718
01:42:41,700 --> 01:43:01,710
自從去年二月財政預算案公佈後咧，市民聯同埋人民力量嘅議員就以爭取全民退休保障為理由發動拉布，提出了一千一百九十二項嘅修政議案，結果撥款嘅嘅條例草案咧延至咧。

719
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:06,160
舊年六月四號，只係獲得通過。

720
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:26,900
根據立法會秘書處嘅統計，喺舊年二月至十二月咧，依然喺立法會大會嘅響中嘅次數多達四百五十九次。喺呢啲叮叮噹嘅呢個鐘聲之中咧，累計揮霍咗。

721
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:37,800
咗我哋近七十小時嘅珍貴嘅議會時間，粗略估計，竊走咗納税人一千六百萬嘅公堂資值。

722
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:45,100
講到財委會同埋公務小組會議上，同樣出現咗不斷拉布嘅情形。

723
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:50,960
以新界東北發展前期工程發撥撥款嘅為例。

724
01:43:51,460 --> 01:44:11,470
去年五月初，財委會開始審議呢項撥款時，便異常繁文，議員拉布，結果經過七次嘅會議，動用咗三十多小時嘅辯論，直至到六月二十七號晚上約十時，至通過呢個議案，而財務委。

725
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:25,960
委員會一年積壓咗多達三十三個項目，撥落今年嘅會議嘅議程入邊。公務小組同樣出現大塞車，同樣積壓咗二十項嘅撥款申請。

726
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:39,860
而拉布造成嘅個果顯而易見，首先係導致基建工程無限量嘅延誤，建築成本增加，估計個金額數以十億計。

727
01:44:40,400 --> 01:45:00,410
有學者亦都提出警告，本港嘅政治環境令香港喺競爭排名上被拖後腿。如我哋香港行政立法嘅關係持續不暢順，會議繼續出現拉布嘅情況，本港嘅競爭力排名只會低處。

728
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:01,740
未見得。

729
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:19,160
正而咧，頭先郭總所講基建嘅工程層面咧，包括呢個道路啊、鐵路啊、學校啊，甚至嘅土地供應啊、排水等等咧，都係直接影響到民生福祉嘅生活嘅質素嘅。

730
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:37,950
但係喺二零一三年至二零一四年咧，財委會只通過咗十三項嘅項目，共批出咗三十六億元，不及咧上一年度嘅百分之五。如果呢個情形繼續落去，對香港嘅損害可想而知。

731
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:58,400
主席，我想指出，一旦基建受阻咧，亦都令到我哋發展金融啊，亦都受到呢個波及，因為國際金融啊人才咧，佢哋都十分注重環境質素同埋環保嘅生活嘅嘅環境嘅。

732
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,860
如果我哋因為交通幹道嘅基建未能及時落成，

733
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:21,580
日日咧都塞車，或者改善空氣污染嘅工程受阻咧，空氣質素差咧，以致土地開發受阻，進一步推高推高個樓價咧，都會影響我哋吸引人才，削弱我哋嘅競爭力嘅。

734
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:29,430
而拉布影響到民生嘅生計，首當其衝係工程人員同埋建築工人。

735
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:49,820
過去咧不斷嘅有建築業嘅工人遊行，表示不滿拉布，連財委會派出嘅工程數目同埋款項減少，影響到佢哋開工嘅日數。有商會甚至表示，拉布嘅同時會拖累會計物。

736
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:57,330
物流、基建等多個周邊嘅行業，建築成本每年額外增加七十億。

737
01:46:57,610 --> 01:47:03,890
當中唔少嘅錢，估計最終亦都會由納税人去承擔。

738
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:10,990
令人遺憾嘅係，拉布嘅議員一邊咧就喺立法會內，啊！

739
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:20,610
遺憾嘅是，拉呢個拉布嘅語言咧，喺立法會入邊咧，唔係咧為著好好履行監督政府嘅工作。

740
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:30,200
同埋審批撥款嘅呢個事項，而係為著反對而反對，無休止嘅拉布、虛耗公帑。

741
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,360
阻礙咧經濟民生嘅發展。

742
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:45,240
一邊口口聲聲表示自己係代表港人，要為港人爭取利益，擺出一副憂港憂民嘅心情，實在。

743
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,550
睇上去只係拆冚捉拆，認真係風師。

744
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:54,180
我想逢過各位拉布嘅語言。

745
01:47:54,460 --> 01:48:10,640
若果你哋繼續以前民前香港嘅市民嘅福祉作為賭注，喺議會內一味拉布、一味拖延政府嘅後腿，日後咧必嚐到自己所種下嘅苦果。總之，

746
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:18,050
為人為己，盡早收手。香港自會有運行，市民自會有得益。

747
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,320
繼續本嚟緊書陣字。

748
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,150
李卓仁議員。

749
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:42,780
主席即係建制派講嚟講去都係個即係喺度炒話，喂泛民你嚟拉布啊，不合作運動係即係拆冚促拆啊，咩為反對而反對啊噉樣樣。即係其實即係我哋泛民而家就做緊一個立法會議員應有嘅責任，就係監督政府。而監督政府咧就係。

750
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:50,540
如果政府啲工程係大白象工程係以民為敵嘅工程，噉我哋梗係反對啦。

751
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
嚇！但你哋唔係嘅建制派。

752
01:48:53,340 --> 01:49:13,350
嚇，至於係政府咧，你又贊成，永遠都唔會為市民去守龍門嚇，然後咧就幫政府咧就係即係保家護航嘅啫。噉就係你哋咯嚇，大家睇清楚我哋一路講嘅嘢。我哋話我哋嘅不合作運動係對啲大白象工程、冇利民生嗰啲係不。

753
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:33,360
合作，但係同市民民生有關嘅，我哋係好想合作，好想快啲上馬嗱。畀一個好清楚嘅例子，就知道呢個政府點樣玩嘢法嗱。呢個六八九咧，就係最中意咧，就係鬥爭嘅啫，最中意就搞行政霸道啊！我。

754
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:53,370
我哋想話同佢傾一樣嘢，嗱頭先啊田北俊議員話啊，你哋不如坐埋同政府傾啦。喂，我哋同政府話想傾嘅，話可唔可以將啲工程排序啊？嚇，即係我哋係覺得要快啲上馬嗰啲，你去上咗馬去咯。嗱，老實講，我哋反對嗰啲，我哋梗係要反對啦，因

755
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:59,830
大白象工程啊嘛，又填海又破壞環保，嚇有啲起咗之後根本就係嘥錢。

756
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:10,980
嚇！有啲人話：喂，噉你哋而家令到啲工程費用增加，好嘥好多錢喎！喂，如果你起一單，譬如高鐵，如果係大家唔使起嘅話，嗰度慳咗六百億㗎啦，已經。

757
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:31,950
六百億幾多啊？所以唔該，大家睇清咗啲數。但係，但我講翻轉頭，講翻你哋個政府嘅行政霸道先。個行政霸道就係佢要鬥嚇梁梁振英六百九，係都要鬥。有一次咧，大家都好記得，我哋就攞咗公務小組主席個。

758
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:51,960
個位，咁然後我哋就同梁振英講，或者大公開同市民講，喂，學校好緊要，我哋想快啲起上馬去起學校。嗱，同埋我想講多一樣嘢，大白仗工程對工人咧唔係最有利嘅，反而啲細工程、學校嗰啲起屋嗰啲咧最有利，因為嗰啲係人勞工密集嘅。嗱，大家要搞清楚呢樣。

759
01:50:51,960 --> 01:51:11,970
嘢，如果講埋工人嘅角度嘅話，所以我哋話學校嗰啲行先啦，啊老人院行先啦，嚇得㗎。咁可能我哋爭啲做到嘅，因為政府話唔得，我一定唔行先。噉我哋作為主席，佢就話：，誒我我諗住咧就將啲學校行先嗱，政府咧就即係點知就真係鬥爭啊，同你鬥過佢咧。

760
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:26,900
就將你想行先嗰啲學校工程咧，抽起唔畀你去行先，然後係都要咧係攞啲即係嗰啲啊大白象工程啊、填海啊、咩蓮塘啊嗰啲咧擺喺度阻住曬。

761
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,480
噉你你要噉樣樣係攔住，噉我哋冇辦法㗎。

762
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:38,570
噉我哋咪唯有即係一路頂住咯，幫市民。但係我哋好想學校行先。

763
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:47,430
係咁啫嘛，咁大家唔該市民評下你邊個邊個啱定唔啱？嗱，而家仲有多樣嘢咧，政府又頂住嘅。

764
01:51:47,840 --> 01:52:07,850
我哋諗住咧，就已經跟住落去嚇啊！就財委會又跟住排序啦。哇！政府突然間就話：，誒，其他我乜都唔傾啦，我係都要你搞咗個創新科技局先。大家記得今日開波嗰時，五C十四局都係大家都已經反對咗啦，已經從我哋已經講咗唔好無謂。

765
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:16,510
離開又整個大白象局長出嚟啦。咁而家佢又係都要搞個大白象局長喺度攔住嗱，大家建制派你咁中意工程啊嘛。

766
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:32,060
喂，我哋通過一啲喺財委喺喺公務小組嗰度咧，我哋通過咗工程項目㗎。而家你創新科技局又阻住嗰啲工程喎。喂，點解你哋唔叫佢攞走個創新科技局啊？然後攞啲工程上嚟先啊！

767
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:42,460
嚇！就算唔係話攞上嚟先啦，排緊隊都有，即係有得排啊！你唔好畀個創新科技局去阻住啊！嗰啲工程我哋通過啲，我哋係覺得係要做嘅。

768
01:52:42,780 --> 01:53:00,370
嚇，然後跟住學校啲工程，我哋亦都跟住落去公務小組會通過，亦都希望快啲做嘅。咁所以而家大家唔該睇下，係邊個喺度？即係喺喺度頂住啲民生嘅建築項目，就係政府自己啫嘛。所以唔好亂咁賴。

769
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:17,040
然後第二樣嘢，我想為工講講翻工人嗰邊個大家講到咧，喂，好唔掂啊！而家啊，即係嗰啲咩建造商會又整個大聯盟啊，頭先又話要譴責阿梁家傑啊噉樣。好啦，你講咁多，最後我想問一樣嘢啫。

770
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:19,510
你講到咁大問題。

771
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,670
講咩輸入外勞啊，主席！

772
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:43,010
你講到而家就嚟要裁員，hit啊，要好唔掂啦！而家大家過唔到工程咧，而家就嚟裁員啦。然後跟住咧，今朝啱啱早啲嘅時間咧，就話：，喂，唔掂啊！我哋要快啲輸入外勞啊！好唔掂啊！我哋工程好需要人。如果真係咁唔掂，就工程唔需要人啦。喂，唔該你哋講清楚，你邊個講？

773
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:57,330
講法啦，一講輸入外勞就話啊，啲工程係啊啊唔夠人；一講到咧我哋審批慢咧嚇，或者賴我哋審批慢咧，佢就話：喂，工人要失業啦！

774
01:53:57,610 --> 01:54:17,620
你唔該，你乜都你講曬，同埋阿黃國興啊，攬為工人講噉樣樣。噉我想問阿黃國興啊，點解工聯會唔抽筆？人哋問你喺勞顧會裏邊輸入外勞，嚇有勞方代表話係贊成咗，其他勞方代表個個都話反對，唔抽得唔答喎。

775
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:20,520
唔答我就唯一個解釋就係今日佢贊成。

776
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:34,170
喂，噉你一方面喺勞僱會勞方代表就贊成輸入外勞，另一方面喺度鬧鬼我哋又話，餵你哋呢班人咧喺度阻住啲工程，然後整到咧建築工人唔夠工開，嗱其實咧。

777
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:45,120
根本建築工人本身咧，最想點咧？就係想唔想有時就飽死，有時係餓死。飽死嘅時候，你係輸入外勞。

778
01:54:45,570 --> 01:54:51,130
嚇餓死嗰時又話知你死，我哋最想就將嗰啲工程真係平均。

779
01:54:51,480 --> 01:55:11,490
嚇！而家其實我哋做緊平均化喎，主席老實講，我哋守住唔畀你亂咁起啲大白仗工程，盡快起啲房屋公屋嗰啲，盡快起啲學校嗰啲。其實我哋守緊嘅喎，守住嘅乜位係咩嘢咧？就係冇大白仗工程，但係有工程，然後跟住平均化咗佢。

780
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:28,100
你哋唔好再輸入外勞啦！我哋而家平均化咗佢，所以而家係好虛偽嘅呢班人建建建制派。一方面話輸入外勞，一方面咧又話鬼殺咁嘈，就話啊舊工程而家好唔掂啦。咁所以主席即係其實根本係雙重嘅。

781
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:29,890
呢位議員。

782
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:50,840
主席，李卓仁議員咧，剛剛就話叫大家睇下，話咧就誒工黨或者反對派咧，反對嗰啲咧都係大白象工程。噉我真係想請市民睇下判斷下，難道設立科技局都係大白象工程咩？反對派咧唔理業界支持，亦都唔理香港產業有噉嘅需要咧？

783
01:55:50,840 --> 01:56:00,380
就係反對，就係唔畀梁振英去設立科技局，唔止，亦都唔理垃圾圍城，就一尾拖，一尾反對，三堆一壇。

784
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:20,670
啊！又話唔夠屋，當政府提出發展新界東北新新界東北話起屋嘅時候，又一味反對，咁唔通呢啲全部都係香港唔需要嘅工作、唔需要嘅工程咩？主席，感謝石禮謙議員咧，今日提出呢個動議。其實公務工程咧，大塞車咧。

785
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:40,680
已經係相當嚴重，就睇下數字咧，已經知道㗎啦。一二一三年嘅立法年度咧，財委會咧總共批出三十九項新嘅工程項目，撥出嘅工程款總額咧係大約有九百億。不過咧，一年之後，即係一三一四年嘅立法年度咧，獲批。

786
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,840
準嘅工程。

787
01:56:42,120 --> 01:57:02,130
只係得翻十三項，而撥款總額咧就只有三十六億，比早一個年度咧大跌九成半。主席，而家我哋面對大塞車，罪魁禍首咧，明顯係反對派喺議會發動不合作運動，少數嘅議員咧騎劫議會，不斷玩程序提議案，以致咧。

788
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:18,580
如果有睇電視直播嘅議員咧，都見到而家每次我哋財務委員會咧都有動議休會或者係中止待續，令到咧基建工程咧係遲遲未能上馬。主席，香港嘅基基建工程咧發展已經唔快。

789
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:25,430
根本咧，如果係同鄰近嘅城市相比，或者社會嘅實際需求咧，都係追唔上嘅。

790
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:42,100
最重要嘅問題咧，就係呢啲工程咧一拖再拖，令到造價大幅飆升，連帶咧每位市民咧都成為受害者，要代呢啲拉布議員找數。主席舉個例子，受拉布影響，立法會審議三堆一籠。

791
01:57:42,660 --> 01:58:02,670
當中嘅一爐咧，即係焚化爐。多年之前一拖再拖，造價咧升完又升。二零零八年咧，政府首次提出石鼓洲興建焚化爐咧，造價大概四十多億。隨後工程費水漲船高，二零一一一二同埋一四年咧，逐年遞增至一百一十四。

792
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:12,470
億一百四十九點六億以及最新通過嘅一百九十二點三七億，即係幾年之內咧，做價咧係幾倍噉樣跳升嘅。

793
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:32,760
其實主席令人嬲嘅，好似焚化爐呢啲例子咧，唔係個別嘅。對上一個立法年度咧，先後就有二十七項工程撥款嘅項目咧，喺財委會或者公務小組受到不同程度嘅拖延。當中六個項目包括有機資源回收中心、港珠澳大橋。

794
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:52,770
香港口岸上蓋發展嘅規劃工程同埋建造研究等等，正正因為財委會未能及時審批，估計咧造價上升咗十三億。而喺公務小組亦都有二十一項工程，因為未能及時審批咧，令造價咧係上升咗十。

795
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:53,190
亦。

796
01:58:53,600 --> 01:59:04,390
主席即係話：短短一年之間咧，單單係因為審批受到阻延，我哋嘅公帑咧已經蒸發咗廿三億，即係咧每位納税人。

797
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:14,880
平均咧，如果當係繳納薪俸税嘅納税人有一百六十萬咁計咧，以二零一一年作為基準咧，大家咧就要一齊畀咧一千四百大元啦。

798
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:35,170
主席，除咗係納税人要畀錢係一齊找數，幫呢啲拉布議員咧找數之外咧，其實誒拉布嘅議員咧係最令人嬲嘅咧，就係雙重標準。好似頭先啊李柱宏議員講係嘛，政府做又錯，唔做又錯，總之咧係乜嘢都錯。部

799
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:41,700
部分議員咧猛烈抨擊特區政府施政，但係當政府咧提出處理問題。

800
01:59:41,980 --> 02:00:01,990
攞出方案嚟嘅時候咧，你哋又會執住一啲問題拖政府後腿，攤緩施政。例如當大家大大鬧政府咧，房屋政策做得唔夠，公屋供應不足嘅時候，令到排隊上樓人士咧越嚟越長嘅時候咧，當政府提出係新界東北發展。

801
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:05,500
增加土地供應，你哋咧又話啊！

802
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:14,070
政府咧係同埋地產商咧夾粉搶走村民嘅土地，又大條道理咧喺財委會拉布，拉完又拉。

803
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:34,450
當大家好猛烈批評而家香港社會流動力不足，唔少議員都挺身而出，就話咧我哋產業發展不平均，金融同埋地產咧發展過大。但係當政府咧提出成立創新科技局，希望咧進一步推動香港發展產業多元化，你哋咧又話。

804
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:44,030
擔心政府咧係又話頭先又話咧呢個係大白象工程嚇，咁咧就又要發動拉布，無求咧就令到建議胎死腹中。

805
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:58,370
主席，最諷刺嘅咧就係拉布嘅議員咧，一直就話拉布嘅目的咧就係阻止大白象工程，就話咧叫政府咧改下議程啦，將一啲冇爭議性嘅項目調錢。

806
02:00:58,830 --> 02:01:18,840
噉佢哋就話唔會阻止呢啲撥款嘅喎。不過主席，乜嘢係有爭議，乜嘢係冇爭議，其實人言人殊，根本從來都冇標準。主席，其次言又再以財委會上星期五審議漁業貸款基金撥款目的好清楚，就係為咗協助。

807
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:21,990
禁止拖網捕魚影響嘅漁民。

808
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:28,760
向佢哋提供貸款，完全係屬於民生嘅問題、民生嘅事項，但係你哋點樣咧？

809
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:49,150
亦都係繼續利用呢個議題拉布，原因好簡單、好清楚，就係呢個係一個人質嚟嘅，幫你哋咧阻止科技局上馬，唔希望咧讓到梁振英咧可以做得成科技局，就係為咗鬥爭。主席，你哋拉布嘅議員、反對派咧，為咗政治鬥爭咧。

810
02:01:49,150 --> 02:01:58,230
而家咧真係唔理民生同唔民生，亦都唔理乜嘢議題㗎啦，亦都唔會理到係咪會央求詞語。

811
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:18,860
主席，其實而家市民咧係見到噉嘅情況咧，真係好心噏嘅。究竟立法會誒而家變成拉布會啦，每次財委會啦、誒公務小組啦，以致人事編制委員會咧，我哋嘅會議加完又加，都未能夠咧係誒處理到咧唔同。

812
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,680
同嘅議程。

813
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:26,910
主席，過去一年裏邊咧，反對派咧喺議事堂搞嘅不合作運動咧，唔單止係拉布。

814
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:33,320
除咗拉布之外咧，就製造流會。根據秘書處嘅資料咧，單單咧係。

815
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:35,490
喺醫院，你發現時間到啦。

816
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,200
請問你？

817
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:57,520
主席，家下啲議員咧，即係賴得就賴保皇黨咧，唔好叫保皇黨啊，叫做賴屎賴尿黨，係嘛？有任何嘅問題，有任何嘅責任咧，唔睇自己嘅，好似李慧瓊講啲噉嘅荒謬絕論。喂，你係保皇黨，你係執政黨，你有四十三個議員喺度，你三十五。

818
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,650
五個乖乖地坐喺度就唔會留會㗎啦，主席唔夠人啦，唔該點人。

819
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:45,740
陳慧儀議員，請你繼續發言。

820
02:15:46,390 --> 02:16:06,400
嗱，主席涉及到呢一個嘅公務工程咧，必須要糾正好多嘅謬誤，好多嘅指責，就話咦啲議員拉布，令到啲工程延誤。喂，你睇翻呢個高鐵，高鐵當年係火速前進啊，火速撥款，加超支過百億。

821
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,450
㗎啲議員。

822
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:25,860
不如否覆啦！當年你哋支持呢個高鐵，我要求政府再研究考慮，至於個選線問題，至於好多氫碳問題做得唔足夠，要求鄭裕華就翻呢個嘅工地工程方面嘅資料咧，要進一步研究。

823
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:34,420
民建聯點啊？哎，好重要啊！呢個工程要快啲做啊！家下超支過百億啊！民建聯賠翻出嚟，保皇黨賠翻出嚟啊！

824
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:37,890
夠快到啩，完全冇阻到啊！

825
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:51,250
頂多係做咗四個鐘頭，我提咗三十個動議。當時其他民主派幫我提咗啲，係嘛？我當時拖得唔夠啊！當時如果拖冧咗係啊，就唔使超支百億啊！

826
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:59,460
所以講工程延誤拖慢嘅話咧，呢個係真係呢個嘅臭不可當呢啲噉嘅講法。

827
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:09,990
啲保皇黨議員我都話啦，改名叫做瀨屎瀨尿黨，啊得個瀨字，完全唔正視呢個嘅事實。嗱，主席講翻呢一個嘅公務工程。

828
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:28,860
好多拖延係政府自己嘅評估錯誤。大家睇翻呢個啟德遊輪計劃，當初政府建議咧就諗住聯撥地，叫啲財團自己出錢，畀五十年經營權佢。當時我已經指出，我話冇團體會投嘅咁大開支。

829
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:49,240
保皇黨冇人講呢個意見㗎，保皇黨個個舉手，政府提出就呢個嘅支持。以外一個啊孤陋寡寡聞嘅議員，當時都指出唔會有財團投一個咁大嘅投資計劃。常理都諗到啦，啲保皇黨去咗邊啊？又繼續瀨屎瀨尿喺度。

830
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:55,070
大啊！政府基於呢個評估錯誤，係嘛？注意你啲語言。

831
02:17:56,350 --> 02:18:10,770
粗鄙得過你粗根係咪？粗根你講粗口啦！你嗰啲四字真言、讀熟呢啲成語啦，粗根係嘛？嗱，講翻呢一個嘅公務工程，當時政府個遊輪嘅計劃評估重。

832
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,980
由當初呢個。

833
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:33,920
呢個零五年開始研究，零七年嗰陣時就招標賣地，最後冇人即係冇一個合理嘅標，佢認為呢個可以接受啦。最後改變嘅方法，政府自行投標，拖到二零零九年啊一月再招標啊。呢個係政府嘅延誤，再講。

834
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:37,330
呢個嘅三堆一路，一路通過咗啦。

835
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:40,510
家仲要上高，家仲要上終審庭啊！

836
02:18:40,790 --> 02:19:00,800
係嘛？你招標完都唔可以簽約啊！如果政府基於呢個嘅一路嘅問題，可以預早明知道有呢個法律程序唔擺上嚟住嘅，擺咗其他項目上嚟，其他項目咪快啲通過咯？呢個政府自己死不悔改，喺保皇黨保價話。

837
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:20,810
護護航之下，啲保皇黨又完全唔理嗰個事實根據，都唔知有幾多個議員知道呢一個嘅一老嘅問題咧，係要上中審法院哦。政府講就做，完全自己唔消化、唔理解啲問題，再講呢個港珠澳大橋嘅拖延。大家如果記得港珠澳大，

838
02:19:20,810 --> 02:19:40,820
大橋政府當初嘅計劃係用呢一個嘅B.O.T嘅形式經營嘅，係希望有財團可以投標，係嘛？跟住就起好條橋，畀個經營權佢，佢可以收費，跟住咧就類似好似隧道嘅形式咧。稍後政府經過某個年期咧，政府就攞翻個控制權。

839
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:55,600
我當時已經指出，當初上財委會投票冇乜人反對嘅啫，得兩三個人反對，我係其中之一啦。當時我已經指出，以嗰個港珠澳大橋嘅汽車流量，唔會有財團投標嘅。

840
02:19:55,950 --> 02:20:15,960
啲保皇黨係乜嘢啊？啲保皇黨議員個個支持政府當時講B.O.T啊，冇人支持我嘅講法啦。最後就係冇財團投標。喂，你哋醒下啦，做下功課，學下嘢，謙謙虛啲，係咪啊？好似呢個棕樹根噉，唔好成日亂咁噏嘢，學好啲嘢。

841
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:35,970
瞭解清楚嘅問題，作為一個議員，你係監察政府，立法會係監察政府嘅施政，公堂嘅開始你有責任審批，唔係做舉手機器啊。行政會議嗰啲就做舉手機器，因為佢有保教護航嘅責任。其他啲立法會議員係有責任監察政府嘅施政。

842
02:20:35,970 --> 02:20:38,390
監察公帑嘅開支㗎嘛？

843
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:53,730
哦，嗰個唔係循例到下逢親政府建議就舉手，有問題有責任就賴呢一個嘅反對派。你睇清楚嘅事實根據，過去幾個大計劃嘅拖延。

844
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:02,790
政府有責任，而呢一個嘅保皇黨嘅議員嘅監管乏力，導致政府喺施政方面任意妄為。

845
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:06,930
呢幾年政府嘅任意程度係誇張嘅，主席。

846
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:10,310
係嘛？你喺議會都咁多年。

847
02:21:10,590 --> 02:21:27,840
哇！你睇啲偏外職位多到直成，真係爆燈嘅啲政務官，大家互相吹捧，互相比位，係嘛？多過每舊年嘅偏外職位嘅增加嘅數字，啲政務官增加係過去嘅兩倍同埋三倍啊！每年計算。

848
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:45,670
啲工廠嘅開支亦都係爆燈啊！而家去到個千七億一年啊！呢個係超乎公務工程正香港嗰個承受能力。大家亦都知道清楚，知道扎鐵工人又唔夠，某啲工種嘅工人又唔夠。你明知工人唔夠，繼續開工。

849
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:48,240
呢個咩心態啊？

850
02:21:48,520 --> 02:22:08,530
同埋你明知醫生唔夠，攰曬啲病人入去呢個急症病房，等佢呢個死啊喺裏面等死啊！你明知工人唔夠，繼續招標，即係就必然導致到呢一個嘅工程嘅延誤，必然導致到呢一個工堂嘅開支嘅增加，必然導致到呢個索償嘅增加。呢啲係普通常識嚟㗎，保皇。

851
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:09,340
講嘅。

852
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:11,140
啊，權貴。

853
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:16,460
啲錢唔係你就可以亂咁嘥，所以我哋一定要守好我哋嘅。

854
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:23,420
崗位做好監察政府嘅工作，唔好畀政府任意妄為。

855
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:27,250
好自然。

856
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,630
多謝主席。

857
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,790
良好嘅行政立法關係對政府推行施政係十分重要。

858
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:39,720
但喺回歸之後，行政立法關係開始變差，到近期咧係跌至低點。

859
02:22:40,140 --> 02:23:00,150
政府推出嘅政策得唔到民心，而當國一建制派不斷將破壞行政立法關係低落嘅關係咧，係推落喺泛民身上，反對派嘅身上，認為就係反對派嘅議員咧，每日喺度就係破壞民生，影響工程進度，令到工程造價延誤，繼而推高成本。

860
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:18,230
但係呢一個咧，民主黨係絕對不能夠認同嘅。立法會嘅職責就係要監察政府，唔係政府嘅舉手機器，唔係政府嘅橡皮圖章。政府不斷咁推出啲大白象嘅工程咧，只會令到事件弄巧反絕，將行政立法關係咧係變得更差。

861
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:36,540
政府當局近年不斷推出大型基建工程，呢啲工程咧動節就要幾十到幾百億，影響住香港未來嘅長遠發展。議員著緊工程嘅審議喺立法會裏邊提出問題係理所當然，亦都係盡咗做立法會議員嘅責任。

862
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:56,830
但係政府啊，只係想立法會做提款機，唔能夠好好解釋工程嘅迫切性，就要威脅呢個立法會唔支持工程咧，就會令到工程嚴重超支，企圖咧係將反對派或者係泛民議員咧演變成為千古罪人，去強逼泛民咧去支持呢啲大白象。

863
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,650
個工程呢啲都係我哋唔能夠接受嘅。

864
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:07,850
其實好多工程嘅問題，或者我哋要查詢，都係牽涉到政府能唔能夠解釋工程嘅迫切性。

865
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:15,230
其中一個例子就係蓮塘口鄉、蓮塘、蓮塘鄉園、鄉園為口岸嘅道路連接工程。

866
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:26,350
呢個工程喺二零一二年七月造價係一百六十二億，但係到當局之前提交上立法會嘅文件咧，突然將有關嘅開支咧增加到二百四十九億，增幅係八十七億。

867
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:30,420
呢一個本質就係代表咗一種嘅超支。

868
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:37,460
呢個超支嘅幅度咧，係達至到原來工程造價嘅百分之五十三點七個percent。

869
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:48,710
當然，相關工程造價增加嘅原因係包括咗工程價格上升、隧道岩土狀況差劣、投標者對工程施工限制風險嘅評估較預期為高。

870
02:24:49,240 --> 02:25:09,250
等等，當局喺回答立法會議問嘅時候、查詢嘅時候，就表示呢個工程一定要趕喺二零一八年之前完成，否則就會對香港嘅間接經濟同埋政府聲譽帶嚟負面影響。更表示工程延遲完工，只會造成造價越嚟越高。呢啲。

871
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:29,260
都係令到外界係恐慌，亦都令到係社會大眾咧係對於嗰個工程是否係真正有佢嘅迫切性咧，係有咗個唔落，有個係認知上嘅落差。但我哋認為呢個只係國，只係政府當局咧係霸王硬上弓，刻意製造一種白色恐怖，迫使立法會咧。

872
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,420
係通過撥款。

873
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:50,810
其實睇一睇嗰啲資料，蓮塘口岸需要喺二零一八年完工嘅講法咧，只係建基於港深邊界區發展聯合專責小組喺深喺深圳方面定出嘅時間，並非係因為香港現實情況而去定出一個合理嘅完工時間，所以要逼住喺二零一八年完工，顯然唔係一。

874
02:25:50,810 --> 02:25:58,160
個強而有力嘅理由，去説服我哋立法會咧，係要喺咁短時間裏邊咧，係要支持增加有關嘅開支。

875
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:09,990
而且香港部分口岸嘅使用情況亦都唔係好似多過預期咁高，就以深圳灣西部為例，深圳灣西部通道為例，二零零三年嘅公務小組工程文件咧就表示。

876
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:30,790
預計去到口岸，去到二零一一年嘅車流量、汽車流量嘅數字咧，係每日四萬六千一百架。但係根據海關同埋入境處嘅資料咧，實際嘅汽車流量都只係九千五百二十九架，同政府估算相差咗三萬六千五百七十架次。換言之，實際嘅汽車流量咧，只係。

877
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:33,870
佔原來預算嘅百分之二十。

878
02:26:34,650 --> 02:26:35,680
而且。

879
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:50,220
近年呢一個喺珠三角嘅工廠嘅遷移情況咧，事實上都令到口岸能唔能夠發揮作用咧，係受到我哋嘅質疑查，亦都有個懷疑喺裏邊嘅。

880
02:26:50,520 --> 02:27:08,530
因為好明顯，因為隨住呢一個國家嘅法例嘅改變嘅時候，同埋所有嘅係勞工成本嘅上升咧，都令到原來喺呢一個誒東部，即係廣東省深圳東部嘅啲工業咧，係慢慢向西走呢一種嘅係。

881
02:27:09,270 --> 02:27:18,230
工廠西移嘅情況，甚至移移到東南亞嘅情況，係會令到口岸確實能夠發揮嘅效用咧，係成為疑問嘅。

882
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:39,400
所以政府不斷噉樣逼工程要上馬，只會令到工程喺我哋工人緊絀，喺成個社會喺基建嘅需要係咁龐大嘅時候咧，係令到個造價咧係更加進一步上升。因此，當政府唔能夠解釋到有關工程嘅迫切性嘅時候，立法會就點能夠成為提款？

883
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:44,250
機咧，我係點可以就噉係好輕易就舉手支持有關嘅工程項目咧？

884
02:27:44,550 --> 02:28:04,560
所以民主黨認為政府當局係應該要就住基建工程定定出優先次序，調整工程進度、審視工程計劃，以維持工程量處於建造業可以持續承受嘅水平，避免出現惡性競爭嘅情況，令到工程造價咧係進一步人為地或者係政府刻意地噉樣做嘅時候咧，係令到。

885
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:04,950
去。

886
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:06,690
誒，繼續上升。

887
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:09,750
另一方面。

888
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:13,990
政府對於工程延誤，其實要負上一定嘅責任嘅。

889
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:23,190
喺本年度立法會公務小組堆積住二十幾項嘅議程，當中有啲係會爭議性嘅，包括蓮塘口岸人工島、欣澳填海港嘅工程。

890
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:31,330
所以泛民提出咗先易後難、民生先行嘅方式去處理，但係最終政府係完全唔願意噉樣做，令到就係。

891
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:39,610
令到就係話，原本一啲工程嘅進度係可以係加快嘅時候咧，都會因為。

892
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:45,100
政府唔願意調動議程嘅時候咧，係唔能夠係加快一啲係。

893
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,770
興係對民生有裨益，亦都冇太大爭議性嘅設施。

894
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:52,480
梁振英話過。

895
02:28:52,760 --> 02:29:12,770
佢成日都強調民生無小事，民生無小事。但係可惜，當要調到要調動議情嘅時間，政府自己想點樣調都冇問題。但係喺個議會上邊，當有啲有爭議性嘅問題喺嗰個審議嘅過程裏邊，我哋叫壓住條路嘅時候，我哋想請。

896
02:29:12,770 --> 02:29:30,850
政府嘗試調動，政府就寸步不讓，呢都係反映咗政府咧係霸王硬上弓嘅行為，企喺將責任推喺泛民身上，亦都係體現咗咧就係梁振英政府咧係對於行政立法關係咧係能夠緩和解咧係冇任何嘅工作。

897
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:33,430
謝偉俊議員。

898
02:29:34,110 --> 02:29:34,900
主席。

899
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:37,810
中國人嘅説話叫相嗌唔好口。

900
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:58,550
今日嘅動議本來咧就係石禮謙咧就想畀個機會大家咧就亦都勸政府咧就積極啲嚇同本會咧就共同尋求解決方案。本係一個比較中立、比較平和嘅一個建議嚟嘅。可惜咧就誒，不論係有啲修訂案又好，又或者剛才嘅發言嘅同事不少咧，都係借。

901
02:29:58,550 --> 02:30:04,920
呢個平台咧就互相係即係finger pointing啊，互相指罵，可能嘥咗成啲原意添。

902
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:24,380
主席最近我睇套戲咧，叫做《啊Sniper》，裏邊有開頭嘅時候講咗個比喻咧，就係話啊，做人有三種啦，有啲係做羊啦，專係畀人蝦啦；有啲係做啊狐狸啦或者狼啦，專係食人啦殺人啦。最緊要需要有啲即係所謂做獵啊牧羊犬啦，即係要保護啲弱嘅，又可以維持秩序噉。

903
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:28,100
主席，我哋而家咧個議會度咧就太多英。

904
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:29,620
太多夾。

905
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:37,260
又或者係咪需要咧第三種動物咧嚟處理呢個咧？咩動物？可能大家要估下，或者要商量下嚇。

906
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:58,280
主席，我先講道理先啦。原則上咧，即係如果講話現代政治咧，講民主化嘅政治咧，最重要嘅一個誒方法或者一個原則咧，就所謂consentatory politics，一個協商性嘅政治。大家見到咧就強如美國。如果你話大家冇協商嘅話咧，就

907
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:10,980
誒有財政懸崖啦，奧巴馬care咧都係有名存實亡啦，到最後鬧親死都啦，當市民都好厭倦都啦，到後最後兩黨都要坐低咧，就喺商量下點樣處理啲問題。

908
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:31,790
道理講完就講現實啦。香港嘅現實係乜嘢咧？主持，香港現實就係話我哋經過百多年嘅港英嘅政治咧，香港市民咧或多或少，甚至超過一半，大部分咧或多或少都有啲感覺，有啲價值觀咧就係非常之崇尚自由，崇尚好多我哋大家都耳熟能詳嘅價值。

909
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:47,300
觀唔係一時刻可以改曬，可以洗曬腦，可以完全變曬我哋誒或者內地政府慣常嘅，或者希望我哋香港跟著嘅一啲嘅模式去處理事、諗事誒，或者係喺政治上嘅方向。

910
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:49,170
呢個係最大嘅現實。

911
02:31:49,450 --> 02:32:09,460
第二咧就係話喺現在呢個議會咧，基於我哋喺嗰個議會規則上咧咁多年嚟嘅一啲嘅比較相對冇乜點改變過嘅議會規則咧，根本就太多漏洞咧，容許雙方咧，如果係唔能夠協商嘅話咧，根本可以就以正義之名，以勤勤力啊監察嘅資。

912
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:29,470
知名咧，做多好多破壞性嘅誒阻燃性嘅現實。我曾經用過呢個例子，叫即係洗米輪啦。表面上就叫洗米，非常之勤力去洗米。但係當洗米嘅時候，如果係唔係成缸米去洗，或者成兜米去洗，而係逐粒米去碾下、磨下、擦下嘅咧，都係叫洗米。你唔可以掛佢。

913
02:32:29,470 --> 02:32:45,270
話怪責佢唔係洗米，佢唔係做緊監察政府嘅嘢。但係如果個過程做粒米去洗嘅話咧，呢個係不切現實、不切實際嘅。但係事實上咧，任何人士如果係鬥氣嘅話咧，事實上喺我哋而家現時嘅情況之下咧，係可以不斷洗米。

914
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:53,020
嚟破壞個制制度，拖延個情況，所以我哋係個現實咧，我哋要一定要係互相再商量。

915
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:55,180
誒。

916
02:32:56,170 --> 02:33:16,180
我哋喺誒佔據運動之後，香港社會嘅撕裂程度咧係史無前例。噉嘅情況之下，更加需要咧我哋議會咧作喺一個帶頭嘅作用咧，希望盡可能咧休養生息。政府呢方面咧亦都絕對不適宜咧繼續咧就無論為咗個人嘅政治。

917
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:36,190
野心又好，或者個人嘅政治立場又好，或者個人嘅政治性格又好咧，繼續做一啲太過英派嘅活動，因為噉樣只係令到個社會繼續咧係撕裂，繼續係互相係指罵，絕對幫唔到嘅情況，亦都漠視咗香港嘅政治現實，亦都可能咧將我哋內地嗰套咧。

918
02:33:36,190 --> 02:33:39,070
搬嚟香港咧，亦都完全不恰當、不適宜。

919
02:33:39,350 --> 02:33:47,050
一個真正為香港嘅領袖咧，或者政治人物咧，係應該可以咧，面對呢啲噉嘅情況咧，可以係。

920
02:33:47,760 --> 02:34:07,770
rise above the horizon啊，對唔住，容許我咁講，即係升高睇睇下睇下咩形勢，盡可能咧喺空間喺政治空間裏邊，即使北方係吹好凍嘅北風到啦，都儘量提供多啲太陽畀南方嘅香港咧，能夠令到香港市民咧喺喺個喺個罅縫罅縫中間咧，繼續可以。

921
02:34:07,810 --> 02:34:13,760
誒，爭取最大嘅一個空間，最大嘅自由度，最大嘅利益。

922
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:25,260
噉嘅情況之下咧，政府作為一個相對嚟講係一個巨人咧，相對我哋議會嘅每位同事係有個主動嘅責任咧，係作出呢一種嘅誒。

923
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:26,870
妥協。

924
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:47,410
誒協調，甚至爭取對方嘅盡量嘅理解誒噉嘅情況之下咧，我相信係呢個時候，李謙議員今日嘅動議嘅真正嘅純粹咧，就希望政府咧係明白到呢一個現實咧，係令到大家可以咧唔使坐喺度咧互相糾纏，互相喺度做一個所謂誒你死我亡嘅互相指責。

925
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:49,260
主席。

926
02:34:50,030 --> 02:34:54,330
中國人咧就好中意講即係持平啊、中立啊、中庸之道。

927
02:34:55,090 --> 02:35:10,320
但係點解我哋香港咧記得我哋中國人嘅社會誒？我哋中國文化嘅真傳，同時得到英國人咁多年嘅一種，無論喺法治上、喺民主政治上嘅一啲嘅啟蒙啦，可以咁講。

928
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:30,610
唔能夠可以誒，可以喺嗰個政治化嘅過程裏邊咧，喺質素方面提高咧，包括喺譬如我哋參考下法庭嘅辯論咧，即使係你死我亡嘅心態都好咧，但係喺表現上喺一個態度上，喺一個啊文化上，都係盡可能咧係。

929
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:50,620
有理性嘅辯論，有一啲甚至乎幽默感，有啲所謂wit，有啲係比較精警啲嘅講法，而唔係互相講啲非常之粗鄙嘅説話，甚至粗鄙嘅動作。因為呢種噉嘅劣質嘅文明、劣質嘅文化咧，絕對不適宜香港咁多年嚟已經有嘅優秀傳統。

930
02:35:50,630 --> 02:36:02,030
我點解唔能夠將法庭嘅優秀傳統咧搬過嚟我哋議會度咧？主席，剛才我話咩動物好咧？我其實可能冇咩好嘅結論，不過突然間諗到嘅就係可能。

931
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:16,920
做只海鷗得唔得咧？我哋又唔好做鷹，又唔好做鴨，做只海鷗可以係比較自由啲，飛高少少，睇遠多啲咧。香港嘅未來，市民嘅將來喺我哋手裏邊，希望大家都可以珍惜呢個呢個機制。

932
02:36:17,330 --> 02:36:19,450
多謝主持。仲有佢。

933
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:22,100
多謝。
