3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:38,490
首先歡迎誒各位出席調查港深港高速鐵路香港段建造工程議案嘅背景及原委專責委員會嘅第九次公開聆訊。

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,080

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,090

8
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:17,570
Mr. King同埋吳先生嘅陪同人士係嘉科工程顧問有限公司嘅集團高級律師Miss Jennifer Kirkin。

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:28,300
噉啊！我想大家注意咧，就上述陪同Mr. King同吳先生出席嘅人士咧，係不可向專責委員會發言。

10
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,580
本席提醒證人。

11
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:44,750
本專責委員會係冇獲立法會授權行使《立法會權力及特權條例》第三百八十二章第九條一條嘅權力。

12
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,370
因為證人。

13
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,020
誒，因此咧，證人係唔受第三百八十二章賦予證人嘅特權所保障。

14
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,840
喺詢問過程裏邊，根據第三百八十二章第十八條嘅規定。

15
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:19,220
對專責委員會提出喺言訊主題上具關鍵性嘅問題，蓄意給予虛假嘅回答，或者向專責委員會提交虛假、失實、捏造或捏改嘅文件，而意圖欺騙專責委員會，即屬犯罪。

16
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,870
我相信證人係會真誠咁協助委員會嘅工作。

17
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:39,670
專責委員會已經制定本身嘅工作方式同埋程序，我請大家留意以下幾點。首先，第三百八十二章所定嘅議員特權咧，只係適用於言訊嘅過程。

18
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:50,900
所有議員，包括非專責委員會委員嘅議員，都應該避免喺言訊過程以外嘅場合發表同言訊有關嘅意見。

19
00:03:51,190 --> 00:04:02,160
另外，我想借呢個機會提醒旁聽今日言訊嘅公眾人士同埋傳媒人士，喺言訊過程以外場合披露言訊。

20
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,390
中提供嘅正功咧，係唔受第三百八十二章所保障。

21
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:16,470
所以，如果有需要嘅話，各位人士同傳媒朋友咧，係應該就佢哋嘅法律責任，徵詢法律意見。

22
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,570
喺稍後嘅過程裏邊，我會要求證人就佢哋曾經向專責委員會提交嘅陳述書作出確認。

23
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:34,990
將陳述書納入成為專責委員會嘅證據，同埋上載喺立法會嘅網頁，公公眾查閲。

24
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,640
而家夠鐘，亦都有足夠嘅法定人數，我宣佈言訊開始。

25
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:54,590
嗱，Antony King先生同埋吳少奇先生，你哋曾經喺二零一五年十月二十日向專責委員會秘書共同提交一份證人陳述書。

即係專責委員會文件第W十三括弧C號。

27
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:10,000

32
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,420
劉振，哦，OK，好。

00:05:48,700 --> 00:06:06,510
噉我想提醒各位委員喺根據專責委員會工作方式同程序第十五段喺公開言訊裏邊，委員只應為確立同專責委員會嘅調查相關並屬於調查範圍內嘅事實而提問。

36
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:52,230
而我作為主席有酌情權，決定某條問題係咪屬於跟進問題，以及應否容許委員提問該問題。

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:03,450
另外，每位委員嘅提問時限咧係啊十分鐘，包括證人嘅回應。委員係可以選擇向一位或者兩位證人提問。

38
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,210
噉就今日嘅言訊咧，我先向兩位證人啊提出第一條問題。

39
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,040
嗱，根據兩位嘅陳述書第十三段咧。

40
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:23,800
貴公司係受聘於路政署，出任路政署嘅監察同核證顧問，啊，佢哋嘅M and V Consultant。

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:32,560
噉就協助該處咧就高鐵香港段項目進行監察同埋核核證嘅工作。

42
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:46,810
咁喺陳述書第三、第四段表示咧，你哋兩位喺二零零九年係起咧就正式參與高鐵香港段項目嘅工作。我想請兩位向專責委員會簡述。

43
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:54,550
你哋以及貴公司喺二零零九年起就高鐵香港段項目嘅參與，唔該。

44
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,220
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

45
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:12,400
We started in 2009 on the first stage of the M and V, which was the design and investigation stage.

46
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:20,850
And we were engaged by the highways department to assist them in their monitoring and verification role.

47
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,100
We.

48
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:36,820
put together a team to look at the quality, safety, programme and cost issues around the project through the design period.

49
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,360
and.

50
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,360
carry out a number of reviews of design documents.

51
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:51,600
preliminary preliminary design and detail design, we carried out some reviews of some.

52
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,340
tender documents.

53
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,190
We carried out audits.

54
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,900
on the work of the design consultants working with MTRCL.

55
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:15,470
We we were carrying out work with the buildings department where we had a team seconded to look at the designs submitted by MTRCL for for for the project. Sorry.

56
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,360
Miss King打斷你一陣，你正話講個team咧個編制有幾大嘅？

57
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,620
the the establishment of our team was about twenty two full time equivalents.

58
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:46,560
那means that we had some people full time and some people not full time, but but 22 full time equivalents, and we had access to about 30 experts on specific subjects within a normal high speed rail project。係好，請你繼續。

59
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,240
嗯。

60
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,850
Okay. So and and the the key to our work was that.

61
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,820
This is a very large project. There are enormous amount of

62
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,240
of documents.

63
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,880
和信息。

64
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,930
And so we could only approach this by sampling the documents.

65
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:20,670
and and we did this by carrying out a simple risk analysis of where the risks were likely to occur in the project, and based on that.

66
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,640
那 risk analysis。

67
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,100
which we carried out jointly with the highways department, we were able to focus on on the key areas where where risk may risk may occur.

68
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,610
The.

69
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,110
work that we did was.

70
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,770
All reported to the highways department in written reports.

71
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,540
by。

72
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,150
Written reports on the documents we reviewed.

73
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,390
by。

74
00:10:50,790 --> 00:11:00,770
monthly report to the highways department, and by presentation to the highways department, where we explained and discussed with them the issues that were occurring.

75
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:09,740
In in two thousand and ten, we were further asked to assist highways in the construction stage.

76
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:30,140
which is the stage that we're working on now, and we we went forward with a similar sized team, but instead of them all being design based, we have a monitoring team on site. We've continued with our work for the buildings department. We're continuing to review documents, but then largely documents generated.

77
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,640
由The Construction Contracts。

78
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:41,230
And again, we review documents and pass comments in writing to the Highways Department.

79
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:53,150
And we have a have a small team on site who are monitoring the site works. They, with the highways department, visit site once a month.

80
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,620
to look at specific things facilitated by MTRCL, we're continuing to carry out.

81
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:09,020
audits of MTRCL construction management teams at the working level for for each of the of the key contracts.

82
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,130
And we are.

83
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,060
working on specific items that arise from time to time.

84
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:25,170
and as well as that side which dealt with the programme, and the quality.

85
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,270
和安全 issues and construction issues. We have a team involved in.

86
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:39,970
Finances of the project, assisting highways department on a monthly basis, determine the the build up of costs as submitted by MTRCL.

87
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,760
你可唔可以講講你個人嘅參與係，自從二零零九年到而家係係點樣樣嘅？唔該。

88
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,480
Well, in two thousand and nine.

89
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,840
嗯。

90
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,450
I I was.

91
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,710

on a monthly basis.

95
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,050
and my main responsibility was for the audits.

96
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:29,820
But I, as deputy project director then, I was also responsible with the project director and the other deputy project director and the project manager for helping to guide the team in in the areas we should look at and and and how we should respond to highways department.

97
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,620

110
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:21,880
Okay, so I I I was engaged as the project manager since two oh nine and up till now I'm still the project manager for the M M M V works.

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:09,260
你哋喺一個工作上咧參與度有冇遇到啲咩特別大嘅困難？你可唔可以同委員會分享一下咧？你哋工作上？

116
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,680
冇，無論係你個人又好，你貴公司又好。

117
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,460
I don't think we've we've met any difficulties.

118
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,150
Based on our expectation and our clients' expectation of what we were required to do.

119
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,560
係完全冇difficulties，係完全冇困難以上。

120
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,530
誒。

121
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,710

no difficulties, no personal difficulties, as you can see from our from our statement.

124
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,160
at some stage, information was hard to obtain from from MTRCL.

125
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:16,320
但無困難度，with MTRCL in terms of the work we had to do. For example, our audits on site, our site visits and and and the monthly progress meetings that we held with MTRCL contract managers. 嗨，吳生。

126
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,930
啊，Well， generally we don't have too much difficulty on our works.

127
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:43,740
Occasionally, we may have faced with some difficulties in getting information from MTLCL, because we have a system of requesting document from the MTLCL via the share point system, which was established at the commencement of the of our work, and we make our request for the documents and.

128
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:55,550
MTLC generally forward all these document to us. Sometimes maybe take a little bit longer than than expected, but we do receive the document. But

129
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:15,920
In some of the sensitive document, like the overall master program, we may have difficulty obtain that instantly in first hand information. So that's why that strictly speaking, in term of difficulty, this may be one of the the area that we are facing.

130
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:35,260
會深深入。你可唔可以誒同我哋分享一下係邊一類型嘅資訊同埋文件係？Particular誒inform誒information誒relate to誒啊誒po誒the overall master program. Basically, keep asking for updating of the overall master program. We do receive誒。

131
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:55,790
contract呃po呃construction or contract programme for individual contracts. So we have we have a knowledge of the the progress of each individual contract and how the the delay of each individual contract impacting on the overall market interference, the addition contractor work or addition contract that.

132
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:02,480
That set the information that we sometime may not be having the first hand information.

133
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,350
盧偉國議員。

134
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,640
好，誒，多謝主席。

135
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:20,230
誒，我首先嘅問題咧都係跟進咧，嘉福公司同埋呢個港鐵公司喺呢個工程監督上嗰個溝通上嘅問題。

136
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,130
誒，正如頭先主席你誒問嘅問題方向一樣。

137
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:45,420
咁其實頭先就阿吳生都講到咧，就係話誒誒嗰個誒project programme嘅問題，或者亦都係喺陳續書嘅九十六段所提到咧，就係喺誒十一月誒唔係二零一一年六月咧就。

138
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:57,420
家科公司咧曾經係要求港鐵公司提供個overall project programme，咁但係當時咧係港鐵公司係提供唔到嘅，咁呢個係咪即係獨立專家小組報告？

139
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:10,860
誒三點一六段所指嘅綜合工程總綱計劃咧，即係integrated master program，即係話overall project program係咪即係等於integrated master program咧咁？

140
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:19,360
就同埋事後咧，其實就港鐵公司有冇係補充翻呢方面嘅資料咧？

141
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:39,650
就另一個咧，都係都可以講係相關嘅，都係一個溝通上嘅問題。就亦都係陳述書裏邊咧，一百三十六段咧就提過，就話咧二零一三年九月嘅時間咧，港鐵公司咧向路政署同埋誒嘉科公司咧提出局。

142
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,120
部通車方案。

143
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:57,040
係咪喺呢個時候？誒，你哋公司先至首次知道咧呢個局部通車嘅方案咧噉，同埋咧路政署有冇諮詢過兩位咧關於局部通車方案嘅可能性咧？

144
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,790
係Mr. King吳生。

145
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,430
In in answer to the first question.

146
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,240
The project master programme and the integrated master programme are the same thing.

147
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,330
And in terms of the MOR, that that that we had one presentation.

148
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:28,750
那係第一次， Jacobs 有知曉有個 MOR 提案喺度。

149
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:38,240
I I can't say any more because after that date we had no direct involvement in the MOR.

150
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:49,260
the the presentation, chairman, the presentation to us was on the I think remember correct is on the August two, one, three.

151
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,840
係咪？

152
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,640
所以那係第一次我們aware of the M.O.R.

153
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,880
係。

154
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,530
誒，我想跟進就係。

155
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:09,550
跟住就冇再就呢個M O L，即係局部通車方案咧，係作過任何嘅跟進或者討論嘅係嘛？

156
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,700
係兩位。

157
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,720
We had no further formal discussions on MOR.

158
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,050
With our client or with MTRC?

159
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,070
OK。

160
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:44,490
誒主席，我想再進一步問咧，就係誒前勞政處處長阿魏志誠先生咧，就喺喺我哋六月二號嘅言訊咧，就指出咧，就話整個項目咧，最後分成咧四十多份唔同嘅合約，每份嘅合約咧都有開工期。

161
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:59,170
但係，魏志瑩先生咁講嘅話，我覺得我哋詳細分析嘅時候，唔應該只睇完工期，仲要睇合約嘅開工期。如果開工期遲咗，而完工期咧又冇調整咧，換中期自然就少咗。

162
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:12,580
唔知兩位咧，有認唔認為咧，港鐵公司冇就延遲批出嘅工程合約調整完工期咧，係會造成多份合約嘅工期出現滯後嘅原因咧？

163
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,420
係兩位。

164
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,680
the the most significant delayed to award was contract 810A in WKT.

165
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,230
那 was finally awarded three months late, and we reported that to our client at the time as being a risk.

166
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:31,880
係。

167
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,760
啊！我想跟進問，吳生有冇補充？係你好，劉劉長劉長明。

168
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,110
呃。

169
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,110
咁亦提出咗。

170
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:49,990
問題，但係就港鐵公司就喺呢方面係冇作任何回應，或者係冇任何調整，係嘛？

171
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,360
Mr. King。

172
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,620
we raised we raised that issue in our monthly report to.

173
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,630
our client。

174
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,560
in in the in the vast quantity of other reports that that went through to MTRCL.

175
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,100
嗯。

176
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,700
and。

177
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,250
This is not the facts that I know.

178
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:30,000
This issue was probably raised, but we certainly raised the issue of a delayed award of 810A a number of times in the run-up to to the award of that contract.

179
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,940
因為它 was clearly it was clearly the largest and most difficult contract and and it was awarded last.

180
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,780
誒。

181
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:48,270
好，我主席誒，我想繼續問咧，就陳述書裏邊嘅第三十三段咧。

182
00:24:48,550 --> 00:25:02,450
就提到就係誒貴公司咧會利用港鐵公司嘅項目綜合管理系統，即係PIMS去檢視咧同高鐵香港段項目嘅相關文件，而作監察嘅。

183
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,980
誒而韋正誠先生咧喺誒本年六月二號嘅言訊之後，亦都有補充到咧。

184
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:30,470
佢話監核顧問即係交科工程顧問公司，可以直接進入港鐵公司嘅系統，知識承建商嘅資料，包括承建商向港鐵公司提交嘅信件，但係咧就唔包括誒附件。咁如果係監核顧問咧，認為呢啲附件嘅內容咧係可以幫助去。

185
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:39,910
進行呢個監察工作咧，就可以透過行常嘅機制咧，經港鐵公司咧係索取承建商嘅相關附件嘅。

186
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:55,540
噉我哋想問咧，就誒唔知誒兩位啦，誒你嘅團隊咧想進入港鐵公司嘅項目綜合管理系統，即係PIMS嘅時候咧，有冇受到港鐵公司嘅乜嘢嘅限制嘅咧？

187
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,960
係，Mr. King。

188
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:12,900
Just a clarification. The the PIMS is is MTRCL's project management system. It's their procedures in carrying out their construction management.

189
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:33,380
And we we had access to the PIMS and to the revisions to the PIMS for our work to date. And in fact, we we reviewed the PIMS at the start of our assignment, and we review each of the PIMS as they're updated by MTRCL as they move forward.

190
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,850
唔差。

191
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,700
啊！

192
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:59,480
regarding the the access into the the system to obtain the information, I think Mr. Low just probably referring to the SharePoint system that we have that was set up at the start of our project. We do have access to to to the system to to.

193
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:19,490
to obtain or to view the document, whether online or to request for the documents. As I mentioned just now, we make the request based on our our risk approach on the risk items and and

194
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:28,840
classify what sort of document we would like to review, and then send our request to MTL Wire, our client, and

195
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,310
and then we will have we'll get the document afterwards.

196
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,620
啊，主席，我想進一步問咧就。

197
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,720
誒。

198
00:27:40,000 --> 00:28:00,010
路政署嘅鐵路拓展處處長啊，陳志恩先生咧喺本年十月二十號嘅言訊裏邊咧，曾經指出過咧。佢話港鐵公司咧係冇制定一個綜合嘅工程總綱，但係咧我哋知道港鐵公司其實有一個工程總綱，有一個master plan。

199
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:05,630
然後咧，就賦予每個工程合約裏邊咧，都有好多本身嘅時間表。

200
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,130
誒。

201
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:23,460
唔知道兩位咧，對於呢個問題有咩睇法？港鐵公司咧是否欠缺一個綜合嘅工程總綱計劃，以致各方係冇辦法掌握咧邊啲合約對於項目嘅進攻日期咧係至為關鍵嘅咧？

202
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,990
係兩位。

203
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,870
Mr. King先啦，唔該。

204
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,450
I think I think in terms of master plan, you're referring to the master programme.

205
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,060
which is the timeline for the project.

206
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:55,140
MTRL did have a master programme. They had contract master programmes for every contract, which under the terms of the contracts were the programmes that were used in contractual terms.

207
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:09,160
That that that was converted into a project master programme, which also included the interface between the contracts and and through to the testing and commissioning, which was which was not necessarily contract based.

208
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,380
MTRCL。

209
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,140
certainly had that.

210
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,540
and。

211
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,900
誒。

212
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,430
To our knowledge, they used that in in terms of planning the work the works that were to come.

213
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,430
但那master program。

214
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,670
which we saw.

215
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,790
sometimes audits。

216
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,430
when it was tabled.

217
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,540
但，was never released to us.

218
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,020
for for reasons that MTRCL

219
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,870
嗯。

220
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,200
May may may tell you.

221
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,690
但。

222
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,970
The point about the master programme was, its criticality.

223
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,340
是基於，The critical path。

224
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,970
到 completion， and not necessarily the progress.

225
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,900
吳生，啊，Chairman，no more supplement。

226
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,660
四百個億。

227
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:18,430
其實即係以你哋誒公司喺呢個項目裏邊誒一個咁重要嘅工作。

228
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,820
就。

229
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:32,610
對於誒嗰個工程總工計劃咧，似乎你哋都唔能夠掌握到咧。其實會唔會影響咗你哋執行合約上你哋嘅職務？

230
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,760
Mr. King。

231
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:46,180
We requested the master programme because it would have assisted us in our work, as it would have assisted.

232
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,260
our client, the highways department.

233
00:30:49,540 --> 00:31:02,500
But MTRCL were very transparent in their reporting of progress and target dates, and very transparent in their in in in their reporting of contract.

234
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,050
target dates。

235
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,480
and。

236
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,380
while it may while it may have have affected.

237
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,790
Our ability to understand when the completion date.

238
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:23,040
was as it was shifting, it it didn't it didn't prevent us from reporting on a regular basis that the project was late.

239
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,630
and that the delays were mounting, and that the delays.

240
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,500
were eventually going to affect the completion date of the project.

241
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:44,380
主席誒，綜合頭先嗰幾個問題嘅回應咧，我就想問兩位證人咧，會唔會感覺喺個工作上咧出現一種咧係？

242
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,370
只見樹木。

243
00:31:46,650 --> 00:32:01,120
見唔到森林嘅狀況，即係話佢可能有啲細節咧，誒佢都掌握到，但係反而整體個計劃，整個森林佢哋睇唔到咧，有冇噉樣嘅感覺？係。

244
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,820
Mr. King。

245
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,450
Do you think you could ask that question again? Sorry.

246
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,900
嗯。

247
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,450
嗰個。

248
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,140
誒，再重複一次咧，誒。

249
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,090
或者用英文講咧。

250
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,550
From the response to the few questions have been asked.

251
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,390
嗯。

252
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,770
我有個印象，那。

253
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,930
嗯， in。

254
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:42,190
in the in your carrying out of your work, seems that you can see the trees, but unable to see the whole forest.

255
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:58,740
That means you may have the details about individual projects, individual programme, but the overall plan is not what you can master. What what the honourable W K Low was saying is that while you were praised.

256
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:03,300
of all the minute details of the development of projects.

257
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,790
但你 have missed the overall progress, the overall plan.

258
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:14,180
of the of the project, especially I think with regard to completion.

259
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:22,970
Thank you, Chairman. With respect, our role was to have a high-level view.

260
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:31,400
And from very early on in the project, we had an overview of the programme.

261
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,560
and that is why we reported consistently.

262
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,890
那個project was in delay due to the various component delays of the various contracts.

263
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,990
And if the delays continued and weren't recovered, there was going to be a risk to the end date of the project.

264
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,710
and as as and that reporting was consistent.

265
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,790
and as we moved into I believe 2012, we then made our own

266
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:10,110
simple analysis of what the delays meant in terms of completion date, and again that was reported to highways department on a on a regular basis.

267
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,770
啊，啊，吳生，你可唔可以補充？

268
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,860
誒，正如Mr. King just said。

269
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:39,360
Well, we have gathered information of all the progress of individual contract. From information that we receive, we made our simple analysis. As we said, we are on a high level. We don't have all the necessary information to carry out a detail.

270
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:59,370
Independent assessment of the likely completion day. We we could only do whatever we could based on the information information that we have in hand. With a simple estimation or analysis, we came up with a project delay early as early as in two two o one two.

271
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:04,800
and then we make our report report to our client, Irish Department.

272
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
That's I think.

273
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,860
overall，we don't see there's any a a problem with the

274
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
啊，with our work as far as啊。

275
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:27,380
on the detail of the of the project, or even on the as an overall view, overall view of the overall situation of the project.

276
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,830
好。

277
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,020
主席可唔可以再？

278
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,560
好，最後一條問題。最後一條好啊，誒。

279
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,380
我我想問下兩位咧，就係誒。

280
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,380
喺你哋。

281
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,590
提出咗你哋嘅報告，指出咗問題之後咧。

282
00:35:48,140 --> 00:36:08,150
其實你哋覺得咧係唔係得到港鐵公司同埋路政處嘅誒重視，同埋咧係有真正咧係跟進呢啲問題嚇，即係佢哋兩方面有冇就你哋嘅意見，或者你指出咧係疑誤嘅情。

283
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,530
情況咧，佢哋做出應有嘅跟進咧。

284
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,840
Mr. King.

285
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,650
just one point of clarification.

286
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:28,400
Our relationship was with highways department. We we were assisting them in their M and V works. We had no direct relationship with MTRCL.

287
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,720
Except audits.

288
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,820
但無其他直接關係與MTRCL at all。

289
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:42,930
we op we operated at what has been called the third tier of the three tiers of of M and V.

290
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:58,020
And we were reporting to our client on a regular basis, and we attended briefing meetings with MTRCL on on the construction progress of con of contracts.

291
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,390
as well as the

292
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,010
extracts from the reports that we have in our statement.

293
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,820
We also presented.

294
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,920
Our.

295
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,960
findings on a monthly basis to RDO.

296
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,130
and that they took them forward.

297
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,820
但 in what form they took them forward and how those were discussed, we we we have no knowledge, no factual knowledge.

298
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,550
唔該。

299
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,430
下一位係胡志偉議員。

300
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,590
啊！唔知唔知吳生有冇？

301
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,770
好，吳生有冇補充？正話一條問題。No, Chairman。

302
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,120
胡志偉議員。

303
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,840
誒，多主席，聽聽咗係誒，涉及兩位同事嘅會議，我想。

304
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,860
即係。

305
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,870
搞清楚一點。

306
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,390
誒，即係有權力。

307
00:37:52,750 --> 00:38:00,560
有渠道可以直接攞到所有嘅一啲你想知嘅係工程細節。

308
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,450
因為你哋可以係誒接觸到pins。

309
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,620
即係嗰個編嘅system裏邊。

310
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:15,100
個piece system係咪會讓你哋係攞到曬所有嘅工程嘅細節嘅資料？

311
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,690
但係你就攞唔到嗰個誒master program。

312
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,080
所以。

313
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,990
你只能夠係。

314
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:38,630
access到嘅係個工程嘅一啲即係好piece meals嘅處境，但係你睇唔到overall pictures，因為你掌握唔到個critical path to completion。我我想confirm呢一個state，我呢個噉嘅係。

315
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:53,730
誒，剛才頭先嘅聆聽咧，唔知有冇理解錯？剛才頭先啊，盧盧議員所問嘅嗰段説話嘅內容，我想問翻呢一點先。即係問題係你係咪好比較掌握嘅係嗰個別嘅工程？

316
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:06,870
個合約嘅嘅情況就係誒，反而就嗰個個總個總體嗰樣嘢係未未冇咁掌握，係咪冇一？因為你冇一個master plan，一個master plan。

317
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,400
誒一個綜合嘅一個一個。

318
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,490
啊！呢個綜合嘅工程進度表嚇。

319
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:44,590
Thank you, gentlemen. Just again, one clarification: the PIMS is a process for managing projects. The access to the documents was through a document management system called SharePoint, and it was through SharePoint that we could access.

320
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,860
Documents that were on SharePoint.

321
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,640
by requesting through highways department to MTRCL.

322
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,680
and。

323
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,900
We requested the documents.

324
00:39:54,290 --> 00:40:00,260
That we needed, and there were thousands of documents on on on SharePoint. We had to be selective.

325
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:06,780
and so we selected documents to assist us in the work in the work that we were doing.

326
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:24,800
嗯，and we did not get。我諗Mr. King嗰個唔係問題，或者或者幫幫胡志偉員就將嗰個問題咧，將個breakdown。你有冇一個地鐵公港鐵公司嘅誒綜合嘅工程進度表？有master plan。

327
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,840
master program。

328
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:36,480
We did not receive a copy of the master programme in in the period leading up until April two hundred and one.

329
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:44,020
Four, two o o one, two two o one four，即係二零一四年之後，你就會攞到嗰個master program。

330
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,440
係，咁答咗你問題啦，都冇嚇，嗯。

331
00:40:48,860 --> 00:41:07,270
我想請兩位可以解釋一下咧個，因為頭先我聽阿Mr. King講咧誒，你哋唔掌握critical critical path to competions嘅，可唔可講講畀我哋聽個critical path to competions係會對你喺成個工程嘅係評估裏邊工程進度評估裏邊有啲咩影響？

332
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,490
Mr. King。

333
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,440
We did not see MTRCLs.

334
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
Project Master Program。

335
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,730
given to us as a whole document that we could review.

336
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,810
它被表決於各種審計。

337
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,610
and so we could discuss it.

338
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,190
We。

339
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,960
could ascertain what the critical path was.

340
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:51,100
what what what were the final contracts to be finished and what were the elements of the final contracts that were to be finished that would impact the opening of the railway and and the opening of of WKT

341
00:41:52,010 --> 00:42:01,360
And but what we couldn't do was ascertain the impacts of the change in delays to the projects in the changing changing to the critical path.

342
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,800
And again and again, we we reported that when we were reporting on the progress.

343
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:21,150
That was declared by MTRCL and that we had observed ourselves that while the reporting method that was being used for reporting delays was

344
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,110
fine， and it was accurate.

345
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,600
the the criticality of the critical path was the important thing.

346
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:42,090
我想問下Mr. King，咁因為攞唔到呢個critical power去做個independent assessment，你哋係有將呢個要求咧係同你個clients highways講咗。

347
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,120
有講過嘅。

348
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,290
有向highways request。

349
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:57,190
Full highways要求MTLC提供呢個係master programme或者critical path。你有冇你有冇經過誒路徑處理clients？

350
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,820
係要求地港鐵公司提供個master program。

351
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,570
We did.

352
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,240
係幾時係向呢個誒勞政處提出呢個要求？

353
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,260
第一次啦，嚇！

354
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,440
十二年。

355
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,240
It was certainly in the very early days of the project, and in fact, the.

356
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:46,850
There, there is a a paragraph in in our report which which specifically refers to the master program. I can't, I can't.

357
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:57,550
翻就得啦嘛！主席，可可唔可以噉樣樣咧？因為呢個都或者你你之後你提供書面提供畀我哋好唔好啊？呢個你第一次係向律政處提出啲要求。

358
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:18,580
呢個master program嘅要求好嘛？Yes，主席，我諗我想多少少知你唔止第一次，因為佢可能係重複係重複係向呢個highways係要求噉，但係我哋似乎聽落就係去到二零一四年嘅四月之後咧，誒，Jus及斯再加到嗰個master programs，咁所以我想即係由。

359
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,380
接及開始take up呢一個job開始，佢。

360
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:27,170
即係on and on去request for呢個master program嗰個情況咧，都有個彙報。

361
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:47,950
係，所以要求係咩話？即係個master programme，因為佢每一次都可能因為佢得唔到呢個master programme嘅時間，影響咗佢對成個工程進度嘅評估。係啊，當然噉，然後佢就好自然地就會請highways去即係去攞呢個文件啦。咁但係highways可能有處理或者冇處理啦。咁但係總會有個feedback翻過嚟㗎嘛。噉我想睇到。

362
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,740
呢一個噉嘅，即係。

363
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,310
responding嘅過程係。

364
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,540
誒。

365
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,500
Mr. King同埋吳生，你哋可唔可以提供？

366
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:17,150
翻嚟睇下可唔可以提供有關你哋向路你個client路政署要求攞呢個港鐵公司嘅master program嘅誒所有嘅要求啦，咁多年以嚟嚇嘅同埋佢嘅回應，路政署嘅回應，如果有嘅話，你可唔可以提供呢啲噉嘅資料？唔該。

367
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,010
Mr. Chairman.

368
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:29,340
Our reports and the work that we do is is the property of the highways department.

369
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,250
and therefore, any release of that documentation will have to come through them.

370
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:47,120
或者你向佢誒向佢哋要誒問一問佢哋好唔好啊？如果係咩，我哋會再。如果你係話，如果佢係唔畀你提供嘅話咧，噉你同到時你回覆翻我哋好唔好啊？

371
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,920
Yes, chairman。好嘛，唔該。Okay。

372
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,950
主席，我我想跟進第二個部分咧，就係誒。

373
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:10,720
site visit咧，我相信係成個監督工作裏邊一個幾重要嘅部分嘅。咁根據文件嘅係誒段落咧，就指出。

374
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,480
所有嘅西醫實質都要arrange或者assist by呢個MTRC。

375
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:31,340
我想問下一嗰個site visit咧，係咪每一次都係有個好specific嘅purpose，或者唔一定每一次啦，即係會經常都有呢個specific嘅purpose，佢為咗一個specific嘅questions咧去做site visit。

376
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:38,640
做呢個西區食嘅時間，誒係咪事先要同Highways咧係溝通咗？

377
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:47,670
去驗方fully驗方fully be highways有啲乜嘢specific嘅問題，想係透過呢個service即係found out。

378
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,920
噉。

379
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:55,430
而你去做survey visit嘅時間，因為要request MTRC去做assistance畀佢去進行survey visit。

380
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:02,490
需唔需要將你嗰個whistle嘅purpose都要inform咗MCRC先至可以做得到？

381
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:20,340
然後做完個survey之後，係唔係會有個full report、full findings，inform翻highways，inform你哋覺得應該有啲乜嘢嘅comments去處理你哋所希望能夠處理到嘅嘢？

382
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:31,700
誒嗰個specific嘅purpose嗰件事，你你可唔可以重複？你其實簡潔啲重複問你啊，我都唔係好明呢個。OK，其實我一連串咁行，我一步一步行咯，我主席會事。

383
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,550
嗯。

384
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,520
每一次嘅西visit。

385
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,780
係咪都係with specific嘅purpose？

386
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,520
YES或NO得㗎啦，係，Mr. King。

387
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:54,040
Chairman, I'll just have to explain the protocols behind the site visit. At the beginning of of our work.

388
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:59,010
高ways Department and MTRCL had agreed the protocols.

389
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:08,370
One of the issues was that our work shouldn't interrupt or interfere too much with MTRCL's work and site teams.

390
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,300
which is reasonable.

391
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:18,860
and therefore it was agreed that on a monthly basis we could visit the sites that we selected.

392
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,500
and。

393
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:33,940
which we agreed with highways department beforehand because they had a team of engineers themselves that were monitoring each of the each of the sites. We then put together a programme of visits.

394
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:54,310
We wouldn't visit every site every month. We'd visit the sites where we knew there were things of interest and issues that that we'd seen in the MTRCL reports and that we we knew about. And we we were specific about the site visits. And within the site visits, we told MTRCL.

395
00:48:54,310 --> 00:49:00,580
what we would like to see in the site visits, and when the site visits were complete.

396
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:20,870
Sorry, and during the site visits, we we talked to the MTRCL site teams on on site. On on some, we were given a briefing before we went out to site on on progress and and what would be seen that day. And at the end of the site of each site visit, we prepared a report for the highways department, which.

397
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,970
They keep on record.

398
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,330
OK。

399
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,510
Mr. King其實答咗我嗰個長商，誒。

400
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:34,000
或者如果噉樣，我想請Mr. King，因為聽落嘅時候就每一次嘅西visit其實係為咗一啲即係。

401
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:50,560
誒對即刻嚟講有興趣嘅係內容同題目，我唔知可唔可以將誒survey set每一次個specific嘅內容同埋出嚟嘅findings同埋嗰個report同埋係highways嘅反應。

402
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,460
有一個嘅係。

403
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,410
即係summary畀我哋，仲係一個係資料咧。

404
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:17,170
你講係個審核嗰個audit嗰個過程嘅資料。I'm talking about a site visit。係頭先Mr. King講咗，每一個site visit佢都係要look into something interest，做嗰個嘅係monitoring或者去睇緊嗰個嗰個工作嘅。係，誒係Mr. King啊，吳生可唔可以提供噉嘅資料？

405
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:17,590
係喎。

406
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:28,230
Chairman, similar to my previous answer, all those reports were produced in confidence for our client, and and it would be up to our client to release them.

407
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:40,080
或者你向話同路政署好似上次咁啦，同路政署提出話，我哋委員會有專責委員會有噉嘅要求，如果到佢係唔同意你誒？

408
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,290
你提供啲噉嘅資料嘅話，你同我哋講翻好唔好啊？書面上，唔該。

409
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:59,440
多謝我仲想有，我想問下咧，誒，即及喺嗰個project control team上邊project control group，信唔住，因為嗰牽涉到就係誒M T L C去提供一啲誒。

410
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,680
即係追趕落後嘅係工具。

411
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,130
嘅時候，即係所謂嘅係誒誒delay。

412
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,930
did they catch up嗰個remedies？

413
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,210
我想問下，即係喺呢個group水邊嗰個角色。

414
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:25,680
有關喺佢哋地鐵公司提出，港鐵公司提出嘅誒誒delay recovery measures裏邊嘅，你哋有冇參與喺啲喺呢個？

415
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,870
程序裏邊，你哋有冇參與？

416
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,030
We were involved in the.

417
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,850
process for delay recovery measures in that we reviewed.

418
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,990
The P.C.G. papers.

419
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:52,700
That were submitted to the P.C.G. meeting and made comments to highways department.

420
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,850
on on on those on those papers.

421
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,150
we didn't we we didn't.

422
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,880
attend the P.C.G. meetings ourselves.

423
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,100
烏智威。

424
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:16,350
誒highways喺二零一二年嘅時間咧，就receive係咪喺二零一二年嘅時候先至開始receive到誒？你哋公司指出。

425
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,680
M.T.L.C.所作嘅誒delay recovery measures咧，係冇乜實際成效。

426
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,370
我想confirm個date，Mr. King。

427
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,870
I think as a as a preamble to that.

428
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,260
所有嘅 delay recovery measures that were proposed.

429
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,270
were at the time proposed in good faith.

430
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,780
as being.

431
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,320
items that would improve.

432
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,380
The out-turn of the project.

433
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,480
We reported.

434
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:10,130
at certain stages, that despite the implementation of delay recovery measures, the programmes were still slipping.

435
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,240
係。

436
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,990
We're still slipping.

437
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,400
我誒你答完啦，係咪啊？先講啲問題。

438
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,380
主席，因為呢個係佢statement上面講嘅，即係喺二零一二年嘅時候咧，誒，佢係指出。

439
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:33,790
Delay recovery measures一個實際成效咧係存疑嘅。

440
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:40,750
噉我想問清楚就係，Highway係咪喺嗰個時間先第一次知道呢一個信息，同埋就係Highway嘅反應。

441
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,210
Mr. King.

442
00:53:50,630 --> 00:54:04,410
yes, yeah, I'm I'm just thinking. I'm not. I don't know whether that was the first time the highways department, in this statement, that is the first time we reported it. We we probably reported it at other times.

443
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:11,680
The fact that although there had been delay recovery measures implemented, the programme was still slipping.

444
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:32,100
Now whether whether whether that statement was specifically to a specific delay recovery measure or whether it was a generality of of the programme slipping even though delay recovery measures had been implemented, I I I I can't say for a fact.係，我想問一問就係呢番跟進同一個方向嘅問題就。

445
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,540
係。

446
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:49,110
當時我大家都清楚，Jacob喺二零一二年已經係向政署提出話有嗰個滯後嘅情況開始出現。咁一路到二零一三年底嗰陣時咧，我講緊係即係如果係唔做嘢嘅話咧，就應該有成十一個月嘅。

447
00:54:49,390 --> 00:55:09,400
有十一個月嘅一個滯後嘅情況，咁其實你由開始一路佢一路係用好多D R M去去嘗試去去挽救個情況個情個情形啦。咁但係一路都唔成功啊。噉你一睇到嗰個係嗰個係滯後嘅情況越嚟越大嘅話，噉你係同。

448
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:22,030
有冇畀啲咩任何意見畀咧路政署咧？即係你係見到開始細細哋噉，而家慢慢越嚟越大嘅嗰個嗰個滯後情況，噉你係點樣處理咧？同路政署方面？

449
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:36,740
Chairman, we we our role was to observe and to review, and to report.

450
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,760
And we reported to the highways department.

451
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,890
through our monthly reports.

452
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:48,860
and at monthly meetings and through our review reports, and we reported.

453
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,470
The delays.

454
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:59,100
The escalating delays, and then some assessment of what those delays would mean for the end date of the project.

455
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:11,850
We, as I said, we operated directly with highways department. Any discussions that the highways department had with others, I have no knowledge of.

456
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:24,430
誒以以你嗰個專業意見，因為佢有個係誒目標一個係完工程完成嘅日子嘅，就係應該係二零一五年嘅八月。

457
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:37,130
咁當時你喺二零一三年根據你哋嘅報告咧，就應該又有十三個月嘅滯後，誒十十一個月嘅滯後嘅情況嘅。噉你認為係喺呢個由？

458
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:51,430
一三年嘅十一月至到一五年嘅八月之間，係追回呢個十一個月嘅滯後情況，你覺得係認為，即係以你嘅專業，即係JAG嘅專業判斷，係冇係咪一個可行嘅做法？

459
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,680
With respect, Chairman.

460
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,930
I'm not sure I'm here to give an expert opinion.

461
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,100
At the time that the delays were occurring, we reported the delays.

462
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:13,670
And we quantified the delays, and we pointed out that if the delays weren't resolved, what the impact would be on the completion date.

463
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:32,850
明白噉，我我withdraw翻我嘅問題啊，副主委員。主席其實誒，我一路未聽到個答案，就係我想問：當家科係report咗呢一個即係delay嘅情況，我想聽highways嘅response to誒家科，同埋佢有冇任何instructions畀家科。

464
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,510
去即係跟進嗰件事。

465
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,880
Mr. King。

466
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,410
we we were in.

467
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:50,730
dialogue with the highways department at the meetings, we we discussed the seriousness of of the delay.

468
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,110
and.

469
00:57:52,390 --> 00:58:01,710
We continued doing the work that we'd been doing to to look at the the key critical activities, and to continue reporting to the highways department.

470
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,250
所以你 don't，你 do not receive any comments or instructions from the highway departments。

471
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,740
on the delay of the project.

472
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:18,480
There was plenty of discussion and comments by the highways department. The whole project team were concerned about about the delay.

473
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:26,030
但係，我唔，我唔 recall， personally， whether we received a written instruction to do something.

474
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:31,900
但交通部和我們和MTRC都完全清楚，有延誤。

475
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:33,980
好。

476
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,580
下一位係田北辰二。

477
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,960
啊。

478
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,310
Mr. King。

479
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,350
啊！

480
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:49,720
The contract that you awarded by the government was close to about one hundred million dollars.

481
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:58,400
The contract that government awarded you was it close to 100 million Hong Kong dollars?

482
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,040
八十五萬。

483
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,100
Okay，close to 100 million，85。

484
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,200
And that's all taxpayers' money.

485
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,890
The nature of the contract that you sign with government.

486
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:21,470
我係 getting very curious now. Was it basically to answer each and every question when government ask, and if they don't ask?

487
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,290
主動 volunteer。

488
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,680
或，有冇個 general spirit？

489
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,070
to ensure that the contract.

490
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:35,470
was completed on time, and there was no cost overrun.

491
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:42,260
How would you conceive of the nature of that 85 Hong Kong dollar million dollar contract?

492
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,480
啊，Mr. King。

493
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,190
I'm not sure. I'm not sure exactly what your question is. Are you?

494
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,370
what's the purpose of that contract that that that that the government awarded you?

495
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:05,330
MTRCL were, if if I can put it into context, MTRCL were awarded.

496
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,080
the job of delivering.

497
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,920
The XRL project.

498
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,320
because of their track record and history of delivering similar projects.

499
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:20,330
It was done under a new form of contract.

500
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,550
for Hong Kong。

501
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,340
嗯，一個所謂的 concession。

502
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,410
arrangement with an entrustment agreement.

503
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:34,460
That we that we all know. My question is the contract government awarded you.

504
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:49,790
And the government were what were you supposed to do? The government were carrying out M and V services, and we were assisting the government in carrying out those services to review the work of MTRCL to.

505
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:56,790
assess whether they were delivering the project in in accordance with their processes.

506
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:05,480
and and that they were complying with good practice in safety and quality and okay so strictly giving advice.

507
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:18,820
Not to use your best endeavour to advise government, to work with MPR, to make sure that the project was completed on time. Right, there's a big difference.

508
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,920
I'm sure. I'm sure. Would you simply give advice? Sorry，第八十二，你可唔可以畀佢答答啊？你問咗問題。

509
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,120
Please answer the question, please, Mr. King.

510
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,160
The spirit. I'm asking about your understanding of the spirit of the country.

511
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,470
The spirit of the contract.

512
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,280
was us working with highways department.

513
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:49,440
whose main endeavour was to ensure that the project was delivered on time.

514
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,950
但係，delivery of the project was in the hands of MTRCL.

515
01:01:54,810 --> 01:02:01,800
great great great， so your understanding is that the spirit of the contract is to work.

516
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:09,460
With MPR through government to ensure that the project was completed on time. Okay, now.

517
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,980
If that's the case, then I like to know.

518
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,720
The first time you attended this so-called PSC meeting.

519
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,200
was in.

520
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,290
February two thousand and fifteen, correct?

521
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,790
correct. prior to that.

522
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,650
You had never attended.

523
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:33,040
The PSC meeting.

524
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,620
which is actually.

525
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:42,720
very very crucial, because that's a direct interaction between government and MTR, where.

526
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,830
everything and anything， would be asked。

527
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,170
answered.

528
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,350
Okay.

529
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:54,310
所以，我的問題，然後變成。

530
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,180
你簽個contract。

531
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:06,960
with eighty five million dollars taxpayers' money with the government, and you knew perfectly well that your main job is to help.

532
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:16,170
ensure that it's completed on time, but you weren't even invited to the PSC meeting until all hell broke loose.

533
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:17,390
In.

534
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,960
二零一四。

535
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,870
啊！

536
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,740
你 accept that？ did you fight for？

537
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,370
attendance at these meetings.

538
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:37,040
Did you actually ever tell government that if we are not allowed to attend these meetings, there's no way I can do my job?

539
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:57,490
你 know， I I have to resign from my contract。 Do you feel attending that is critical for you to really understand this whole thing， rather than keep reading papers and papers and charts and charts？係，Mr. Mr. King，真係答係，你覺得。

540
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,940
係出席呢啲會議係咪重要咧？

541
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:07,440
就係淨係即係唔係淨係睇文件，亦直情係出席會議係會係對你工作嚟講係好重要。

542
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,340
the the。

543
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:25,190
The protocols and and the methodology under which we carried out our work was as directed by our client. Our client required us to support them in in the work that we did.

544
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,490
and we were not invited to.

545
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,730
The PSC meetings. Did you ask to be invited?

546
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,230
我唔記，得我唔係喺度，全部時間。

547
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:48,530
係阿吳生，你哋有冇要求過咧？呢間公司收咗八千五百萬立場嘅錢啊！會點不順意，或者等佢答一答先好嘛？我想我想問埋先好嘛？而而家我問緊嘢，OK？

548
01:04:49,080 --> 01:05:00,950
你收咗八千八萬納税人嘅錢，你承認你主要嘅精神係令到盡你嘅能力，令到呢個誒項目可以如期完成。

549
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,010
但係佢冇邀請你出席呢個會。

550
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,860
噉你有冇強烈要求？

551
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,670
吳生。

552
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,450
啊！

553
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,740
啊， Chairman。

554
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,610
啊！一啲嘢，開發完盤。

555
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:36,900
Thus, our main role is to monitor the and carry the MMV services to ensure that MTLC are carrying out their work in accordance with their project management system and in accordance with the engagement agreements.

556
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:38,460
啊！

557
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:42,550
We are a lot obliged to our.

558
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,300
for the.

559
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,080
啊！

560
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:54,730
the the the problem that arise during the course of the construction that cause the delay.

561
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,550
啊！

562
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:16,840
as far as I recall, the protocol for our monitoring system was set up at the start of our services, and we were directed by our clients to carry out the works in accordance with the brief that we are。主席，我時間有限，我個問題好簡單啫，你。

563
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,430
你有冇強力要求？噉啊，有定有或者冇啫。

564
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,910
有冇要求咧？唔使話簡簡潔啲答。咁簡單嘅問題。

565
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:33,020
We don't recall we have made such a request for attending the PSC，但係我哋可以check，但係我唔recall。

566
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,250
吳生，你即係話畀我聽，你接受咗個。

567
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:44,420
噉嘅公誒一個噉嘅合約，你亦都明白你主要嘅目的。

568
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:53,810
個使命係要令到佢盡量如期可以完工，但係呢個咁緊要嘅會。

569
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:58,580
因為你係透過呢啲會，你先知道廣鐵嗰啲D R M啊。

570
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:12,860
係得定唔得㗎嘛？又或者佢有冇D R M啊嘛？甚至乎你可以喺度會度問佢critical part㗎。你冇master project program，你都可以喺P S C度問佢個critical part㗎嘛？

571
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,880
係咪？但係你從來冇出席過，直至去到一五年嘅二月。

572
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,370
噉你？

573
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:25,330
你你點可能履行你嘅職責？噉你啲advice咪全部係？

574
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,130
港鐵話幾多畀你聽，你就悲喪嗰樣嘢。

575
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:34,210
你嘅責任要喺BSC嗰度質疑港鐵㗎嘛？

576
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:38,570
啊！咁點解你會真唔記得你有冇要求出席呢個會咧？

577
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,500
Chairman，啊。

578
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,700
係，啲啲啲。

579
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:54,310
Well, we have this three tiers system. The protocol set up at this with this three tier system, we.

580
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:56,300
We were.

581
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:16,160
directed by our client because at each tier we have different people and we are assisting the highways department in the M and V works and then our clients they have also have a team of professional engineer who will be also sitting in this second level and the third and the third highest level meeting.

582
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:24,920
up to the directors level, so all our reporting is all in accordance with what we are asked to do, and

583
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:46,450
We all you as the engineer from the from the highest department. We also we will bring forward this our comment or our our concern to the second level or even to the highest level to MTLCL and最簡單嚟講，你唔記得你有冇要求出席呢個會議係嘛？

584
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:52,010
你唔記得？No，我個問題唔係佢有冇請你啊。

585
01:08:52,290 --> 01:09:08,810
我嘅問題係你收咗政府一個簽咗個合約，你都有一個即係除咗商業啊，你都有一個責任嘅。呢啲係公堂嚟㗎，你睇唔過眼都可以出下聲㗎。佢冇請你，咁如果佢咩文件都唔畀你，噉你係咪咩都唔問啊？

586
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:29,720
都唔會㗎，係嘛？Of course，係咯。竟然成個過程八千五百萬嘅公堂嘅一個合約，你開聲要求話喂路政署，你真係要我幫到你，我要真係出席呢個會議問下嘢嘅。如果唔係，我就畀港鐵同埋啲民建

587
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:36,950
牽著地址走嘅咯喎，噉佢一味話信我啦，信我啦，噉我就要信嘅咯喎。

588
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:42,170
你因為你一齣席咗會議，你就知道佢啲DLM得唔得㗎啦嘛？

589
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:46,390
點解你會得連噉樣樣去問都唔問呢？

590
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:54,400
好啦，咁既然你承認啦，你唔記得仲有冇問啊？噉你今日睇翻轉頭，你覺唔覺得你哋好失職咧？

591
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,340
識傾或者唔生。

592
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,380
幾多個question？幾多個question？

593
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:06,470
問個question about。

594
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,120
sorry what was the what was the question again?

595
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,420
吳生，你答唔到我啊！

596
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:21,840
我唔想再翻譯啦，我其實可以英文問嘅。吳生，你答唔答到我？你覺唔覺得你有冇失職？啊，I I don't think we have。

597
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,850
啊啊！

598
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,860
Well, we follow all all what we are asked to do, and we don't. I don't think we have a.

599
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,550
冇任何 mistake on as far as we're concerned.

600
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:51,830
噉你原本話係想盡你嘅能力令到呢個工程完成，但係最緊要嘅會你冇去開，因為人哋冇邀請你，你連自己有冇要求都唔記得，噉你身為一個顧問。

601
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,700
噉我都覺得，我都有啲質疑。

602
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,770
你專業方便喎，真係。

603
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:59,110
因為呢啲係公堂嚟㗎嘛，係咪？

604
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,750
誒，咁噉，咪咪。

605
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:06,220
Yes, please. I understand that. May I just answer that?

606
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,350
MTRCL were required to ensure the project was delivered.

607
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:27,400
The highways department were monitoring what they were doing, but the responsibility for delivering the project was MTRCL, and we were assisting the highways department. The highways department set out certain protocols.

608
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:35,100
With some agree with MTRCL about meetings and site visits and various other things.

609
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:42,840
and we followed those protocols and we reported consistently from the information we had about.

610
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,740
The status of the project.

611
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:59,250
what was happening on the project and the delays and the consequence of the delays, and so it was absolutely clear to to everybody our view on the state of the project from 2011 up until 2014.

612
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,560
In November of 2013.

613
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:22,130
Alright, one month before December, when you declared that project eight ten A and B were fifty three weeks behind in November two thousand and thirteen, do you still believe that any kind of DRM can salvage the situation?

614
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:44,260
MTRCL were reporting that, despite the delays, they could recover. I see, and you tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, just like the government. We were not in a position to give them the benefit of the doubt. We reported what we saw, and what we read in the in the reports, and made our assessment and reported to government. And your report to government.

615
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:49,180
In November of 2013, was that you do not believe it can be completed on time?

616
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:58,340
或那，subject to the effectiveness of the DRM， it could be completed on time. What exactly was your advice to government?

617
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,760
在November of 2013.

618
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,380
專題制。

619
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:16,220
Because even that meeting，我唔係，我畀你答一答呢。No，we've，we've，we，we，have。

620
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:36,510
subsequently seen the events that led up the last quarter of two thousand and thirteen we were not at any of those meetings we weren't appraised of any of those meetings we were continuing with our work on site in in monitoring the contract programmes and and and the work that was being done on site okay well Highland.

621
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:43,660
田北辰議員，一其實田北辰議員咧係係誒提出咗一個比較重要嘅。

622
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:53,780
一個問題，我都想藉呢個機會咧，係同呢個專責委員會咧，係澄清呢個問題，就係有關你哋嘅工作。

623
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:01,140
因為我之前我聽咧，你哋係一個monitoring and verification consultants嗱，我。

624
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,560
特別係強調一個consultant，需要一個顧問嚇。

625
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:18,490
咁同埋，你哋係又話有個職責係去確保呢個係嗰個誒呢個工程咧係如期噉樣喺嗰個目標誒完工時間嗰度完工。

626
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:39,230
咁但係你正話答嘅問題，田北辰議員嘅問題咧，似乎嚟講到咧，你嘅角色係完全被動嘅，你係只係咧就係話踢一踢一腳就喐一喐，踢一腳喐一喐，係完全一個被動一個角色嚟嘅，就完全冇一個主動嘅角色扮演一個主動嘅角色，即係你係完全。

627
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:59,240
係唔畀意見嘅，即係路政署叫你做乜你就做乜啊。叫你做誒audit你就做audit，叫你做呢樣做A做A做B就做B，但係完全係冇一個主動向呢個路政署你個client提供一個專業意見嘅一個角色嘅。我噉樣嘅理解啱唔？

628
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:19,250
啱咧？究竟係邊一個係咧？你係最初嗰個同最初個你話係要確保啊，幫勞政署確保呢個目標、呢個員員工時間，同埋係一個consultant。但係似乎你而家同田北田北辰議員講嘅嘢咧，係完全唔係一個consultant嘅角色，一個mechanic嘅角色。

629
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:26,870
啊！請，我想你誒答回答畀個問題，Mr. King同埋阿吳生都係，所以我想搞清楚你哋個role係咩？究竟係咩嘢？

630
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,500
議員。

631
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,790
The responsibility.

632
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:41,950
and excuse me if I go back over over this, the responsibility for for delivering the project on time was with MTRCL.

633
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:50,740
Highways Department were monitoring their work and we were assisting them in the monitoring.

634
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,780
We reported.

635
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,060
Exactly， what we had seen by reviews and site visits.

636
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:12,860
And we made we gave advice in our reporting and at our progress meetings about the status of the project and what would happen if the if the project continued in in the path that it was going.

637
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:23,630
And that that so it wasn't a passive role. It it was proactive in terms of finding the information, sorting the information and presenting it to our client.

638
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:28,680
唔深。

639
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,800
其實。

640
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,780
誒老毛十幾蚊。

641
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:44,730
主席啊，主席，但係佢會都冇去開，佢憑咩資格話佢？佢講咗佢冇開呢啲會，佢又好可能係冇要求開呢啲會，點啊？唔該，翻個威爾。

642
01:16:46,280 --> 01:17:05,650
主席，唔該，主席。誒，嘉科工程顧問雖然係政府聘請嘅獨立顧問公司，但係咧，我見到過去你哋提好多嘅建議，好似都冇得到政府同埋港鐵嘅重視嘅。咁所以，我哋先至質疑嗰個監察機制係咪真係起到作用？主席，我有四個問題想問。

643
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:25,940
想問啊顧問公司嘅，就係根據路政署署長劉瓜劉家強先生，佢喺六月九號提交畀我哋呢個專責委員會嘅補充資料，即係文件嘅編號G九嘅附件二咧，就話你哋獨立顧問曾經係檢視過港鐵地盤勘測同埋個岩土報告，亦都喺。

644
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:45,950
二零一零年嘅一月十二號，係去信過畀港鐵，就研討報告提出咗有三個關鍵嘅意見，嚇三個關鍵嘅意見。我想請問顧問公司，你哋提呢三個關鍵意見，到底指嘅係乜嘢？而呢三個關鍵嘅意見，根據你哋嘅。

645
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:50,630
理解係咪構成咗日後工程延誤嘅因素？

646
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,310
港鐵同埋政府咧，有冇正視到你哋呢三個嘅意見咧？係。

647
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,340
Mr. King.

648
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:11,510
Sorry, could you repeat the document number?

649
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,310
好啊，係文件編號G九嘅附件二。

650
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:27,400
嚇，路政署署長劉家強先生喺六月九號提交畀我哋立法會呢個專責委員會，係補充資料嚟嘅，係。

651
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:36,220
係關於呢個地盤勘測。

652
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,420
同埋岩土嘅報告。

653
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,910
I'm not.

654
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,430
I'm not sure if we've got that with us.

655
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,400
William係唔生係咪啊？

656
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,650
sorry，你係咪William係咪嚟啊？請問嚇，係。

657
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:03,950
係你嘅一封信，喺一二零一零年一月十二號畀勞政處嘅一封信，係英文嘅。

658
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:06,200
你 sweep到幾耐先見啊？

659
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,290
你哋講嘅critical observation。

660
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,630
可能是。

661
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:13,820
Sorry，啊，Mr. Fan，can you repeat the paragraph that you are referring to？哦，主要係一月十二號嗰封信係你哋寫畀港鐵嘅係。

662
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:16,410
yes.

663
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,820
我哋打開嘅，嗱，左耳部。

664
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,000
我哋寫啲。

665
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:25,440
Our letter is to highways department.

666
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:36,010
你哋係咪係講到話係有三個關鍵嘅意見，就嗰個即係誒檢視港鐵嗰個地盤勘測同埋岩土嘅報告㗎嘛？係。

667
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:55,980
請問你哋揾唔揾到嗰封信喺邊度？如果唔係主席，使唔使容後？因為我哋仲有第二節嘅，一係就我。

668
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:16,270
係問第啲問題先係，或者第問題啲問題先。我唔想唔想阻大家係好。第二個問題就係路政處處長喺上一次嚟我哋喺度言訊嗰陣時咧，就話路政處喺誒監核港鐵嘅工程進度嗰陣時咧，一直有一個判斷。佢哋嘅判斷就話工程滯後就唔等於最終係會有。

669
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:36,280
有疑誤嘅，我當然唔認同佢呢個判斷啦。其中顧問公司就喺二零一三年嘅七月就已經，你哋估計咧高鐵完工嘅日期咧可能延遲差唔多整整十一個月，而顧問公司喺陳述書裏邊第九十二段嘅附表裏邊咧，亦都係。

670
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:56,290
講咗咧，二零一三年嘅七月嘅每個月嘅進度報告裏邊咧，你哋確實有向路政署提出延誤十一個月嘅呢個估計。但係路政署署長喺嚟我哋呢個言訊嗰陣時咧，就話獨立顧問即係你哋呢十一個月嘅估算係建基於一個嘅基礎。個基礎係咩咧？就係港鐵。

671
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:16,300
如果完全唔採取任何追回進度措施，先至有呢個十一個月嘅估算噉。路政署嗰陣時做咩咧？佢就話選擇信任港鐵，所以就冇聽到你哋講即係呢個獨立顧問。你哋提出呢個嘅誒警告又好誒温馨提示又好，我想請問顧問公司，你哋。

672
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:30,820
到底認唔認同路政處處長嗰個嘅睇法？其實你哋當其時提出嗰個十十一個月嘅延遲嘅話，其實係咪有考慮到港鐵採取追回進度措施嘅影響嘅？係。

673
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,760
Mr. King.

674
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,860
the the。

675
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:51,530
11個月 delay was was our assessment based on the information we had from MTRCL, which we reported to highways department.

676
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,460
and。

677
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,400
That was that was a raw.

678
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:02,210
Calculation based on the situation at the time.

679
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:14,130
It did not consider the impact of any future DRMs or any DRMs that were in the pipeline. It was a straight interpolation of the current delay to the end of the project.

680
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,180
嗯嗯。

681
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:37,130
好明白，好噉。主席，我誒第三個問題就係港鐵行政總裁上一次嚟到我哋呢度言訊嗰陣時，承認咧就話工程嘅前期工作緊縮嘅準備時間咧，所以咧就令到有三份嘅合約八一零A、八一零B、八一一A三項涉及新。

682
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:54,030
西九總站嗰個嘅合約咧，就出即係要做多次嘅修訂。嗰個修訂嘅次數係多得驚人嘅。對我嚟講，八一零A嘅合約咧，就去到二零一三年，即係幾年前六月咧，就已經有一萬三千五百一十三次嘅修訂。

683
01:23:54,310 --> 01:24:14,320
咁根據顧問公司你哋掌握嘅資料咧，呢啲合約嘅修訂到底可唔可以避免嘅咧？例如，如果港鐵去有合理嘅時間係去做一啲前期嘅準備工作嘅話，係咪就有機會唔需要有咁多數量嘅呢個嘅合約嘅修訂咧？而呢啲嘅修訂對？

684
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:27,490
高鐵工程嘅進度嚟講，係咪就真係好似港鐵佢多次強調，呢啲係一啲細微細眼嘅修訂，唔係即係令到嗰個工程嚇，因為有大量呢啲嘅修訂係出現咗疑誤嘅咧？

685
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,510
十K。

686
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,090
I'm I'm not sure.

687
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,000
我可以 answer that。

688
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:43,260
question。

689
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:49,140
except to say that on major construction projects.

690
01:24:49,810 --> 01:25:00,230
most drawings get revised a number of times from preliminary design through detail design and then when you get to site and site conditions are understood.

691
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,020
Apart from that, I can't answer the specific question that you raised.

692
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,680
唔嘥噉嘅補充。

693
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:27,000
no，German。但係根據你哋嘅專業判斷，你哋過去嘅經驗嗱，我係講緊八一零A、八一零B、八一一A噉啊。港鐵誒就唔願意透露裏邊啲嘅細節，我係只係講話其中一份嘅合約喺兩年前嘅年中嗰陣時已經有成萬三次嘅一萬三千次嘅修訂，呢個係咪一個？

694
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,690
常態係咪一個正常嘅咧？係係，我哋知係會有修訂嘅出現，但係嗰個次數係多得好緊要。

695
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,220
三份合約裏邊，其中一份喺兩年前已經有一萬三千次嘅修訂。

696
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,160
啊，Miss King或者吳生德。

697
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:51,360
Apart from what I said in my earlier earlier answer, I can't make a judgement on that those thirteen thousand revisions.

698
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:59,200
噉你能唔能夠評論呢啲嘅修訂嘅次數咁多係有機會會導致嗰個工程嘅延誤咧？係。

699
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,510
又或者係滯後咧，係。

700
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,820
你哋做唔做到呢個判斷咧？

701
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:20,660
我唔係，

702
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:33,080
I can't say we we we we did know that there were an enormous number of drawings.

703
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,530
on this contract.

704
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,070
WKT。

705
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:54,940
and that those drawings were being revised as as the work progressed in the early stages. I can't make a comment on that number。唔，我唔係要求你誒，你你誒評評論呢件事，我係話你知唔知道呢啲噉嘅修訂嘅存在，一萬三千幾條修訂。

706
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:05,960
Personally, personally, I can't say that I was aware of the thirteen thousand revisions。係阿吳生咧。

707
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:26,250
呃，Well， we know there are changes in the design during the construction stage. But we don't know. Sorry, my question was specific. We don't know the exact number. Are we aware? Are we not aware? Well, we don't know. We are not aware of the thirteen thousand numbers. Okay. But we only aware of the total. They are. 佢哋唔知道有噉嘅數字。明白。多謝主席協助。咁誒就。
