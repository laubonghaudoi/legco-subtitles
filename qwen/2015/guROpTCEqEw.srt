1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,790
啊，點樣？

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:14,220
選主席，選主席，你做麻薯啦。冇啊，Danny想啊嘛，Danny你係個呢個consultant，你接受主席，好冇嚇？有冇有冇啊？OK。

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,560
同埋我，我同謝偉智會多啲嘢問。

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,850
都係噉樣，但係不過同你多啲。

5
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,470
係，噉我哋進入誒議程嘅第二項，好唔好啊？

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,260
誒應該係有請。

7
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,930
冇見啊！

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,890
以前嘅第二項，我哋有請律師會嘅代表同埋administration政府嘅代表，好嘛？

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,470
係噉樣。

10
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,900
呢度個座位點喺度？

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,030
嗯。

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,430
佢哋講有冇paper要講，定係就咁講自己立場？

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,480
個關係。

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,080
bring us few個paper。

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
邊個paper？

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,650
佢要加減嗰啲咯，譬如佢點解要？

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,960
點解要噉樣講？

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,560
解釋下。

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,440
民族。

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,220
通常叫一啲標明。

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,220
Hi, Mr. Cohen.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:30,210
Thank you for coming. If members don't mind, I would like to invite Mr. Cohen, Mr. Colin Cohen from the Law Society, to basically update us on the latest position regarding these rules and to to give us the Law Society's latest position on this matter. Thank you.

23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:47,320
Mr. Chairman, first of all, I think there needs to be some apologies here for the extensive delay in respect of this matter, and mere culpa will come from our end in respect of this because the delay since last time we were here in 2005 has been a very, very long time.

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:03:07,710
The changes since 2005 as to what we're facing today are not very large. What we have done over the time is try to modernise and update these very very difficult rules, the accounts rules, which nobody likes. I mean, it's quite interesting. I examine accounts and every single student and every after.

25
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:27,720
我們都説，請廢除這個主題，因為它是個困難、複雜的問題。這些規則的目的是嘗試將一切納入一個部分的會計規則。之前，你必須到第A部分去，到實務指引，到這個指引，到那個指引。所以，現在你有在第V。

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,020
Accounts rules is one set of all the rules together.

27
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:51,310
We took on board the comments that were made to us last time we were here, in respect to the interest. But with great great respect, the interest provisions is one great big red herring, because with regard to the current rates of interest at zero zero zero one for V to have even, for example, I give you.

28
00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:03,890
舉個例子，在我的律師行，這是一家中型、較大的律師行，位於香港，有16名律師。我們每一個月會在客户帳户裡存入約3500萬至4000萬港元。

29
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:15,580
The interest on that, I did a bit of research before I came here with my accountant. How much interest is due on that whole amount? Fifty five dollars last month, forty eight dollars the month before.

30
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:35,870
If we're going to try and get more than $500 on a four-day period, you're going to have to have over six billion Hong Kong dollars in your client's account to even get the $500 in that amount. So, at the moment, with interest rates being so low, I think all of this becomes a very academic issue per se.

31
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:51,880
Once interest rates ever get back to the five percent, and goodness knows when that will be, I think we are going to have to talk to the Americans about that. I don't see that happening for many, many years. Then the system we have in place now is clear, unequivocal. How it works out in respect of matters as well.

32
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:12,170
The other provisions here, I think, are just very straightforward. It's definitions more than anything else. I have to thank the DOJ who have been very, very helpful. I mean, fortunately, we in the law society, my technique on drafting isn't very good. They have been very, very helpful and have responded very, very efficiently to anything we've put to them. The problem.

33
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:32,180
Problem been over these years is that nobody really gave this matter the real attention it's needed. You put accounts on the back burner. It's not how could I say this is not the most, you know, pressing matter that happened. There's a change in the committees. I took over from the last chairman, Mr Michael Innes Smith. The consumer council set on matters. The chief justice, when he got the pre.

34
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,110
Chief Justice sat on matters, but I don't want to push the blame. Apologies, it should have taken that long period. Full stop. So.

35
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:59,420
I am delighted to go through in great detail these rules. I am delighted to take any questions people would have to ask. I mean, those solicitors here, I am sure, are very familiar. I used to examine them. I think, if I remember, when they were at Hong Kong University, and I still examine on this subject. So I'll be able to take up any questions on any matters as well. I hope I've given a bird's eye view, Mr. Chairman. Unless you want me to say anything further.

36
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:16,590
Thank you, Mr. Cohen。誒，不如咁啦，我誒請咗律政司嘅代表去發言先，跟住我睇下委員有啲乜嘢嘅問題，咁跟住我再處理嗰個嗰個誒條例本身啦，好唔好啊？阿黃生。

37
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,250
Is there a translation service? Nothing's coming through to me, so it's a bit unfair. Why don't we do this in English first? I would prefer that if we could do that.

38
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:41,260
If that's okay, Mr. Wong, would you mind doing your your representation in English? No problem. Thank you. Yeah, just just I'd like to thank Law Society for for the clarification about the OJ's role in this matter because. Hi, my, hi, my.

39
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,380
有冇麥啊？你啊，阿德，你或者埋少少，thank you，應該可以，係。

40
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,730
咁或者我用翻中文嚟表達喺呢個。

41
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:17,000
好多謝主席。誒，首先我想多謝翻律誒律師會方面係澄清翻我哋誒律政司嘅角色，因為的確今次嗰個一套嘅規例本身咧，其實就係由誒律師會個理事會本身係即係制定嘅。咁當然亦都經過即係誒。

42
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,070
啊！

43
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:38,760
首席法官嗰邊嘅同意噉，所以我哋喺當中其實個角色係盡量希望配合同埋支持，希望能夠做好個功夫。咁但係由於個角色問題，令到我哋睇到咧，我哋係一方面我哋會畀一啲觀察一啲啊comments啊，有一啲即係評論，但係最後究竟成個文件點樣處理或者個草擬啊？

44
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:58,770
表達背後嘅政策同埋內容咧，其實個角色都係喺啊律師會嗰邊嘅。咁呢度並不代表我哋係某一個角色喺度，我哋淨係想喺呢個機會，主席係啊將呢個啊分工係能夠清晰化。咁所以，如果有一啲關於闊啲嘅法律政策嘅問題，我哋都好樂意去表達意見。實際上喺手路上，我都有一個問題就。

45
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:18,780
關於嗰個涉及到利息嗰計算嗰度，都想作出詢問。不過我諗可以喺稍後一個階段當睇一啲具體嘅細節時候再表達。咁但係我哋想即係重申，我哋都係喺以往嚟講，一如以往，我哋係即係誒盡量配合呢啲誒規則嘅制定。喺我哋都係喺盡早嘅時間咧作出回應。咁好開心見到啊，Mr. Colin佢喺今日。

46
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,560
嘅表述上高，亦都係澄清咗呢點。多謝主席。多謝黃生。

47
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,230
啊，或者我畀機會委員啊，睇下初步有咩問題先，好冇？

48
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,690
暫時未有，咁不如我有請啊啊法律顧問咧。

49
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,500
幫我哋去。

50
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:50,490
睇一次，即係因為因為因為你可能最清楚，而家雙方誒而家暫時係呢個階段有啲乜嘢係未達成共識嘅，或者你可以誒帶我哋行一次好嗎？

51
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,520
咁個出發點啦，大家誒最好就拎住秘書處嗰邊準備嘅標明文本啦。

52
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,760
誒L誒L N一五一。

53
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,480
咁或者可以誒請誒律師公會嗰邊咧，得唔得？大家有冇L N一五一呢個文件喺手？

54
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:29,900
有，係啦。噉我哋嘅誒標明文本咧就係誒左手邊咧就係誒現行嘅條文嚟嘅，右手邊咧就係呢次而以加入或者誒修訂嘅條文。咁或者請誒誒誒律師會、律師公會嗰邊誒。

55
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:50,190
跟住個標明文本誒向誒委員解釋咧，就係點解？譬如有有噉樣樣嘅作出嘅修訂，點解想加？點解想改？好簡單咁介紹一次。噉我喺到適當嘅位誒位置咧，我就會將雙方面誒有誒。

56
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,790
有唔同意嘅地方咧，或者向律師會嗰邊誒提出嘅問題嘅。

57
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,040
一五一零。

58
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,940
係誒文件編號係C B四一三九誒stroke十二十三零五。

59
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,420
嗯。

60
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:27,560
誒係啦，譬如喺誒零零一頁嗰度咧，誒議議嘅第即係第一版咧，係係想加入議議第一A條原則嗰度嘅，或者請個施工會嗰度解釋點解要加入原則。

61
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,460
陳總，對。

62
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:48,750
Yes, for the reason why—I mean, the reason why we did all of this is for many reasons. First of all, we looked at other very similar legislation in other jurisdictions.

63
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,810
To help members, and the object of all of this is that if you are, let's say, a

64
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:14,100
在香港，正如您所知，你可以開辦實習後兩年。所以，你係新晉資深律師，經過兩年，你成為合夥人。你想要有某啲非常非常清晰嘅規則，去説明啲規則係咩。所以，一A係基本上係將啲定義同啲原則，作為維持你哋嘅錢嘅基礎。

65
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:34,110
Separate from office money. It is very, very straightforward. I mean, it basically says that how does one run one solicitor's accounts? To run one solicitor's accounts, one starts with basic principles, and the basic principle is the holy grail of solicitor's accounts: Thou shalt not use clients' money other than for clients' purposes.

66
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:54,250
And you got to have it all set up in such a way that is clearly identified and dealt with. The reason for having all these particular definitions, and I presume you want me to go for all of this, is to basically say that in the event of trouble happening, and in the event of the occasional bad apple, then.

67
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:13,460
We got to rectify matters. We can make it clear that you know from the very beginning what you do with regard to the principles of keeping your money separate. So you can see little A through little J makes it very, very clear as to what you want to do. And I, for an our point of view, was to make sure that the members of the law society who have to

68
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:22,310
Have your bookkeeping computer or otherwise have these clearly set out. So that deals with 1A and the principles in respect of other matters as well.

69
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,130
I think that's a very very good way of dealing with it. Most other jurisdictions deal with it, and it makes it easy for the solicitors to know what they're doing.

70
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:42,730
誒或者誒律師公會可以解釋下，而以第一A條係誒現在嘅practice directions裡面有冇嘅咧，定係完全係新嘅咧？

71
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,880
一，一。

72
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,290
reflected some existing rules. For example, in rule one A.

73
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:09,470
小A，它 refers to the solicitor practice rules。For example, in little J，the deliver annual accountants report it reflects the section section eight of the legal practitioners ordinance。

74
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,010
Let me help out. I think if you remember what I said at the very beginning here, you asked me why we're doing this.

75
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:23,740
As I said beforehand, you had practice rules, accounts rules, indemnity rules, all over the place.

76
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:33,250
We wanted to put into one document the fundamentals of the solicitors' account rules. Well, let me put the question to you: What's wrong with it doing it this way?

77
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:50,440
I think I'm a bit confused here because, as I said at the beginning, I don't think. I mean, I'm saying to you, I thought we can all read, we can all think, we can all go through this very clearly. You know, solicitor must do A, B, C, D, J. All of this is fundamental.

78
00:13:50,720 --> 00:14:10,730
Either it was in the rules previously, either it's good common sense, and it was taken from some other matters which I looked at the English rules, the Australian rules, and we said, oh yeah, this looks quite a good idea to put this at the very beginning, and it makes a lot of common sense for people. So you have something at the very beginning which tells a solicitor how important it is to keep your client.

79
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:30,740
Money separate from your office money. So unless we can be, could we be more particular as to specific areas in which you have a gripe with, and I can answer those specific areas, which makes it far more better for me to come here and try to help you out with that. These are just principles, and principles are principles. So if you have an issue with this, tell me what the issue is, and I

80
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,110
我可以address each one. Don't want it sound to be difficult, but I am very very busy at the moment. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Cole.

81
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,320
Because there is no.

82
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:58,920
Perhaps you could do this in English. It's easier for me to hear it in English from you. No information note has been provided to us. So in order to assist members to understand which part of the proposed rule is new and which part are from existing practice directions, I just we just want information coming from.

83
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:08,270
from the policymaker as to to highlight the new parts to the members for them to consider. Okay, let me help you out with that.

84
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:19,880
A previous, B fundamental principle summarising, C if I recollect is summary, was wasn't before, D summary before.

85
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,210
E general summary, F general summary, G practice direction, K practice direction.

86
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:41,360
I general summary. J previous council rules. Thank you. It seems pretty fundamental and understandable to me. So unless members have any questions, we'll move on to the next item. Thank you.

87
00:15:47,480 --> 00:16:07,490
So you want me to go through the interpretation? No, it's okay. We'll we'll we'll let the legal adviser handle this. Unless there is anything, we'll ask for your assistance. I think that's far better and far more efficient. So I can just answer your questions as to what's. That's the way we're going to do it. And we did write quite a long letter, if I recollect, in respect of all of this, and saying yeah, we do accept certain things, giving our views.

88
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,150
If we turn to page two of the markup version.

89
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,910
proposed.

90
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,540
amendment to rule two.

91
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,820
the the first line, we see a

92
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,220
Term a current or deposit account.

93
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:41,100
It is noted that here the rendition for deposit account is儲蓄户口，which is the same as the rendition for savings account，also儲蓄户口。

94
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:48,070
An enquiry has been made with the law society as to whether different words should be used.

95
00:16:48,440 --> 00:17:08,450
and and I noted from the banking ordinance that the rendition for deposit account is存款户口，而as the rendition for savings account is儲蓄户口，and um would the law society please reconsider um whether

96
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:17,460
That it would be consistent with the existing law to adopt different term for deposit account and savings account.

97
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,560
真係呢啲噉樣嘅嘢咧，有幾？

98
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,820
都多嘅，因為佢全部我哋raise咗畀佢咧，佢都。

99
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,900
嗯。

100
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,310
Where's the answer to it?

101
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,150
Well, I've just been informed by Miss Wong, the legal adviser, that.

102
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:51,960
similar nature of queries, there are about 10 to 15 of them. Now, I think it will be a quite a time.

103
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:04,690
not a very efficient use of time if we are all to sit here and go through them one by one. Now the Law Society, correct me if I'm wrong, has been provided with the list of these queries.

104
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,300
啊！

105
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:19,990
So all we need from you, really, is. Month of November, we wrote a nice letter which I saw trying to answer all of these. Have you seen my letter or our letter? And I think we've answered them all. I mean.

106
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,390
Frankly speaking, if you want to come up with a better wording, which you think is going to be, I mean.

107
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:44,530
Splitting hairs, you know, it's not going to get anywhere. You know, I mean, this is why this matter is being delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed. I mean, I think in the end of the day, I'm quite happy to put to put in it whatever is going to be easier for the normal person to understand. We're talking about, you know, the working part is considered not necessary to make any change on the first one, but

108
00:18:45,030 --> 00:19:05,040
你知，如果你諗，如果某人作為DOJ，或某人諗，它會幫助成員律師或成員公眾，噉，由，你知，我意思係，佢睇起來係一件好明顯嘅問題，即係咩係現金、存款或活期賬户。問題係，你放錢喺銀行賬户，通常係活期賬户，因為你喺度可以賺利息。

109
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,800
has to be a bank in Hong Kong. So, so any ideas of it not being a bank in Hong Kong, it's covered later on in the rule. Says it must be a bank in Hong Kong, but you know.

110
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:22,690
I mean, I'm open to any views and respect to this if it's valid. I think we answered that saying, well, we don't think it is that necessary. But you know, you know, if you want to.

111
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,520
Change it if it's in the best interest of the public by all means. I don't think it is. I think the rules are clear.

112
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,910
Let me clarify.

113
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:42,450
作為legal adviser to this subcommittee，我已經寫出我的觀察，在我的信給律師公會，他們基本上回覆我。

114
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
嗯，心口誒。

115
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,740
not answering our questions or not accepting our recommendations, and there are some obvious.

116
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:04,810
and there are some places where the Chinese and the English text of the proposed amendments or the proposed law.

117
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,930
have different meanings.

118
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:23,520
So that's why I I take the time to bring it to members' attention, and either the and it depends whether the law society will take it on, and I can see the difficulty because Mr. Colin doesn't understand Chinese, and a lot of it this is on the

119
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:44,330
Rendition of the Chinese text and the English text. The answer to all of this very very simple. Those just below me, I trust them implicitly. The DOJ, they're the experts on getting sure the translation is correct and dealt with, and I know they're very very helpful. Perhaps because they've come back with some comments saying they don't think they don't think they're too worried about it, but surely the

120
00:20:44,330 --> 00:21:04,340
Best people to make sure there's no. I agree with you entirely. There mustn't be any difference between the translations. And I can't, you know, I mean, I I can't deal with that myself. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Just one second. Anything from the Department of Justice on this? Thank you, Chairman. Again, we would like to clarify our position. Yes. The law is not.

121
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:21,140
社會事務諮詢委員會是實際上係製訂這個草案的，我們已經提交了我們的意見。我認為，立法會的立法委員已經提交了他們的意見。我認為，立法會的立法委員已經提交了他們的意見。

122
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:42,320
This definition of the meaning of deposit account or savings account, I note the exchange between the parties, and we we believe that this is something which the law society could maintain their view rather than following the suggestions from the from.

123
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:56,280
The legal adviser, but I noted from their response. In fact, there are a couple of places where the Law Society is prepared to amend the draft. For example, at page four of their letter of the seventh.

124
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:12,390
Of November and page five, there are two places, two two items which the law society consider appropriate to amend the draft rules, and of course, ultimately, if members here feels that there's a need to

125
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:22,690
make further changes is really open to members, but on my part, I think there are some issues I like to make it quite clear are really well.

126
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:42,980
within the discretion of the law society council, we do not have a strong view either way. So, but if, for example, chairman feels that the suggestions could be further considered by law society council, we will be happy to provide further input to the law society council so that perhaps some amicable amicable arrangement.

127
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,190
安排能可達成對技術性譯文。

128
00:22:46,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Because well, sometimes we we we do not feel that they they must be amended. But I think sometimes perhaps so you don't have a firm view either way on many of these amendments. Can I take it on most of those? We feel that there's no need to change them.

129
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:21,850
on specific issues on a few of those I can read from my colleagues' comment from the law drafting division because I come from the legal policy division looking at the law broader legal policy issues but on law drafting points I understand that my colleagues have passed their observations on a few places where well they they are open to changes but I think it's really up

130
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:36,620
到社會事務諮詢委員會， to make a final decision. Of course, subject to the subcommittee's power of amendment. Sure. Okay, so I I understand your position quite clearly. Thank you. Thank you. So in order to shorten the process, shall we just focus on

131
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,930
the the parts where there is not yet a consensus between the parties.

132
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:54,630
但having taken into account what was just been said by the Department of Justice that they don't have a firm view on most, if not all, of the issues raised.

133
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:04,920
SEN'S CHAIRMAN, perhaps to clarify that we would say that most of those points raised, but helpfully raised by the AOA, would not necessarily require amendments.

134
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:25,330
There may be a few points, a couple points, actually, that would be up to Law Society consider further, perhaps, whether to make those amendments. Unless Chairman would like me to go into details, but I think Law Society would be in a better place because they have considered, I understand, through their working party, so they have taken into account our comments, our law drafting colleagues' comments.

135
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,690
before responding on the seventh.

136
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,660
Okay, thank you.

137
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:53,580
So, Miss Wong, what she will do now is to just go to those few more difficult or controversial ones, if I may put it that way, and and to cut out to cut short the process. Is that is that okay with members? Thank you, Miss Wong.

138
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,140
O O O Seven of。

139
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,500
We're looking at.

140
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,940
the same.

141
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,040
paper。

142
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,600
我 wish members to look at the Chinese text.

143
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,130
O O O Seven。

144
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:23,300
L L N one，呃，is still on。

145
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,980
誒one five one。

146
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:32,020
L.N. one five one. The rule is rule nine on exceptions.

147
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:45,490
If you just read the proposed amendment to Rule Nine,

148
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,120
Bracket two C small letter one。

149
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,800
嗯，The Chinese part.

150
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,540
It is not readily comprehensible. When I read it out in Chinese.

151
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:09,310
係，已有一份事務費單或關於事務費款額的其他書面告知交付。

152
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:29,900
如果呢度咧，大家唔睇英文嘅話咧，就咁睇呢句咧，其實係睇唔到。其實律師公會想講嘅意思啊，律律師公會嘅李小姐，或者你幫唔幫到誒我哋去解答呢個問題啊？其其實咧，我哋喺封信度咧，十一月七號嗰封信咧。

153
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:37,030
我哋亦都答咗關於呢個烏拉C，誒烏拉二C一嗰個告知交付。

154
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,340
嗰個中文。

155
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,350
嘅逆法。

156
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,260
噉我哋係basic DOJ嘅advice咧，佢都認為係唔需要改咯。

157
00:26:47,720 --> 00:27:07,730
係嗱，呢度係講緊，究竟講緊啲乜嘢嘢咧？係講緊係個律師將張單或者關於款額嘅一個文件交畀個客啊，定係其實你睇落去咧，其他書面告知交付，定係你叫個客講緊交付去畀錢？

158
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,220
嗱。

159
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:22,740
即係如果你唔睇英文咧，你係完全睇唔到個意思嘅。已將一份事務費單或關於事務費款額的其他書面告知交付。

160
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,220
你係咪叫緊個客去畀錢咧？

161
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,020
定係你話個律師拎住張單，或者拎住一個有銀碼嘅文件。

162
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,710
佢交畀個客咧。

163
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,180
我。

164
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:46,260
我都明白個字面上係咪有少少誒問題咧？個中文嗰度。

165
00:27:46,540 --> 00:28:01,030
但個中文嗰度咧，佢有講已有一份事務費單或關於事務費款項的其他書面告知交付。咁呢個就係指嗰個事務費單。

166
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:14,520
係啦，譬如你睇誒書面，其實係一個我哋話係應應用詞嚟嘅，但係你係啦，誒，但係你呢度用咧其他書面，好似其他文件噉樣用法咯。

167
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,510
嚇，其他即係你。

168
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,740
你。

169
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:28,920
其實就咁睇係睇唔明嘅，即係你你可能你睇咗英文，你畀英文影響咗，但係如果你就咁第一次睇中文，唔睇英文嘅時候。

170
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,860
豬食。

171
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,740
或者誒係啦。

172
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,570
我知。

173
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,020
即係威震言體。

174
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:44,400
問講嗰部分係咪已經cross out咗嘅？即係而家delete咗嗰部分嘅裏邊，其中一句嚟㗎。

175
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,980
誒講緊係喺。

176
00:28:47,280 --> 00:29:07,290
第零零零零七頁，唔係係零零零七頁右手邊嘅一羅馬數字一同二嗰嗰誒嗰個第一嗰個誒嗰句啊，後面嗰句啊，已有一份事務費單話關於你睇唔睇到啊？謝偉俊。O.K.嘅，嚇。

177
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,490
course.

178
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,720
has been delivered to opposing suggestions.

179
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,650
誒冇㗎，因為佢都唔會受嘅，佢本身佢哋自己係啦。

180
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,680
我以前。

181
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:42,850
係可進仁醫院，係。嗯，我好快咁諗，我就會覺得係以一個書面，我唔知咪書面方式定係點，係交付畀個客咯。交付係嗰個係係個動詞，係畀個客。

182
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,110
嗯，即係用一個書面。

183
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,520
即或者我唔知係咪書面用一個文件。

184
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,630
誒去畀個客咯，其實嘅意思就係。

185
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,390
係啊，本身。

186
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,270
以前規常性。

187
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,500
係。

188
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,620
仲有個鐘啦。

189
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,260
即係。

190
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,620
sorry，主席係咪我應該將嗰個交付擺上上面，已交付一份嘅咯。

191
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:26,350
現時律師已有巴拉巴拉，然後告知交付。你可以話已交付一份事務費單或關於事務費得唔得？

192
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,840
將個動，將嗰個。

193
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,290
That is Chinese. What is written here is not Chinese.

194
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,320
諗唔到。

195
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,540
李小姐，李小姐，你誒？

196
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,630
你覺得謝偉俊議員嘅意見，你能唔能夠接受？

197
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,890
我試過。

198
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,910
誒係咪話應該改做已交付一份事務費單？

199
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,080
Right.

200
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,350
或關於事務費款項的其他書面告知。

201
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,360
係啦，即係將個交付。

202
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,370
搬上去，易交款有一份。

203
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,990
呢個要慢慢翻去再諗，呢個要慢慢再翻去再諗。

204
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,850
黃先生。

205
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:41,660
因為一方面，當然我哋唔係畀法律意見，即係啊律師會嗰邊。但係如果譬如話，今次議員提出嘅意見，我哋可以稍後。如果譬如啊律師會覺得再同我哋啊攞啲我哋有啲觀察嘅話，我哋可可以樂意咁做。現階段我個觀察就係誒，如果中文嗰度修訂英文，好明顯，亦都要作出修訂，因為英英文。

206
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:57,870
has been delivered。咁所以可能真係要一拼，再諗一諗個表述係點係最適合。因為只要我啲同事提出嘅時候咧，其實係覺得係誒可以唔改動嘅。原因係點解就係中英文對照嘅時候咧，其實個意思係清晰。咁當然議員如果有意見係再再修訂，好樂意。

207
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,290
再諗。

208
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:11,230
嗱，咁啦，誒，大家聽咗聽咗議誒誒啊，謝偉俊議員嘅議員咧。

209
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:31,530
Is the money? It's when you're putting the money into your office account or your client's account. But Mr. Colon, I think we're we're not in difference over matters of principle. Rather, it is the use of the exact wording in Chinese that is causing the the problem. Can't there be a proper? I'm sure someone can translate it.

210
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,070
係啊！

211
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:52,360
I'm sure it can be done. It has or it will be done already. But I think we've heard the comments made by the honourable Mr Porcher and the legal adviser, and also the Department of Justice. Can I, sorry, can I put the ball back to the Law Society on this particular provision? Absolutely. I think what we

212
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:11,280
Can do is try to have a, you know, get this all sorted out by sensible corridors. It seems to me this should be done very, very quickly. Yeah, it's a mere, it's a mere format. It's a mere form twist of the the wording. So this one you've got. Yeah, absolutely. We have no problems with that. Yeah. Okay. So shall we move to the next controversial?

213
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,910
嗯。

214
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,010
嗯，the following one, proposed rule two A, on page seven.

215
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,340
嗯。

216
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,090
if we look at the proposed

217
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,940
to a。

218
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,840
你會見到，律師必須。

219
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,940
do A, B, C.

220
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,910
and then if you look at small Roman two.

221
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,890
一些。

222
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,830
The solicitor must do this.

223
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:48,840
failing which the payment should be paid in the client account not later than the third working day following the receipt.

224
00:33:49,450 --> 00:34:02,540
can the can the law society explain why if if something is made a mandatory requirement, a solicitor must do this, and there is a failing which

225
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,920
And on, and the failing word provision is followed by the word should.

226
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,030
So is the is it really a mandatory requirement in the first place?

227
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:29,210
Yes, Mr. Cohen. Yes, well, I mean, let's look at it very clearly. What you've got here, you've got a situation as a solicitor when a bad amount of money comes in, and it's let's say the client gives you a hundred thousand dollars, and of that hundred thousand dollars, oh, part of that is for counsel's fees.

228
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:49,710
You then have the decision as to where that money goes, and as you can see, you know if it includes a disbursement as well as a client's money, whether it's meant to be for a bit of both, you you then decide what it is. You then decide whether you can split it or whether you can do that. And if you can't, sometimes it goes into office, sometimes it goes into client. If there's any doubt, you put it into client.

229
00:34:49,710 --> 00:35:05,590
within a period of time. The problem is why you need that is it may take some time. The reason why you put the four to five days are because everyone knows as solicitors sometimes there's uncertainty as to what exact that money consists of and what that money is for, and that's why that extra time is needed. It's as simple as that.

230
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,560
我明。

231
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,340
誒，委員有冇問題？

232
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,900
係何俊仁議員。

233
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,670
四到五days。

234
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,240
maybe too short。

235
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,440
Well, because the service may have to sort out.

236
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,780
the the relevant say finance or invoices before， so。

237
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:52,310
Well, you know, your point's a very good point. People on a committee raise that, and in the end, because of the comments that this is so important, it means you've got to turn to it within four to five days. Remember this: there is that saving rule whereby you know you make a mistake, you make a mistake other than clerical mistakes. You know, so you've got to have a time period.

238
00:35:52,310 --> 00:36:05,550
And if you go any longer than that, four to five days working days, which is actually four to five working days, is taking you into more than an actual week. Actually, if you go over that, so yeah, that's not. It's a point that was raised, and in the end.

239
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:25,840
Like committees, you find you got people with different views, and we thought that was the best timing. If you feel that it should be a little bit longer, I don't quarrel too much if you want to change it to the fifth, to the sixth, or something like that. But you wouldn't want to go. I mean, I mean, Mr. Chair, both of you are very experienced solicitors. I think one knows the problem is this one is the client gives you the ex dog.

240
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:37,230
So you're not too sure. Well, some of it is for this thing, some is for that. And you've had that before in practice, I'm sure, Mr Chair, Mr. I mean, you know, you've had that problem many, many times. So we think that was the easiest way to work it out.

241
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:44,320
In reality, this is not going to happen because everybody just puts it straight into their client's account and then sorts it out later.

242
00:36:44,840 --> 00:37:04,850
And that's what happens. Which you can do. You're never what you're here. There, you're not in the breach if you get it into the client's account. Okay. Even though put in the client's account. Correct, absolutely, and and really. The bill ready. Otherwise, you don't put it in the office account. Exactly, exactly. And and this idea of we put in these rules because they're there for the exceptions in respect.

243
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:23,280
所以，我認為

244
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,550
唔該，誒，所以。

245
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:38,190
所以是個legal advice，suggesting the word shell should be used instead of shoot。我我我，just thinking about the logic，because if something is made mandatory。

246
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,340
then the logical consequences.

247
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:52,900
That will be ascension following, or so you must do something. Otherwise, ascension. But now, what the law society is proposing is you must do this.

248
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,180
fail in which you should do something.

249
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:04,580
So it seems to. What's what's what's the what's the? Is it really a mandatory requirement? That's my question.

250
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:25,060
Because because we're giving you exceptions. What we're saying to you, you know, you determine what it is. You then decide whether it's going to go into the client's account or not the client's account. If you're not too sure, then you do this. So, the fundamental mandatory is the first step is to determine what that money is for. Once you've determined what it's for, then you deal with it in accordance to the

251
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,350
所以我唔係太sure whether getting close to splitting the hair a bit, but

252
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:38,700
I could, I don't think it's a real issue here, frankly. Because in legislation, we usually talk about what you may do, what you must do.

253
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:47,250
is is is uncommon to talk about what you should do. you what you should do is usually in a practice direction.

254
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,540
所以，我我。

255
00:38:49,910 --> 00:39:09,920
Just, but it's a policy. Yeah, but the problem, the problem here is you got anticipated disbursements. You see, and and it's not crystal clear. So it gives the flexibility. You determine it if you're not then sure what it exactly is. Then you do with it. See, in practice, money comes flying in from clients. You know, you got a surveyors report to do.

256
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:29,930
You got costs on account. You've got councils' fees. Numerous things happen, and even going to pay your fee notes out of it as well. So, if it includes a disbursement as well as clients' money. So, for example, you know we want you to pay councils' fees, and they want you to put money on account of costs. So, I'm giving $100,000 of which so much is for councils' fees, and so much is on

257
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,600
Account for the future. Now you got a choice.

258
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:52,890
Of where you can do that as well, and that's how it works. And you know, it's not. It's really the crucial issue is to a a solicitor must then do A, B and C. Once you get to C, if that part is for a disbursement incurred but not yet paid, either pay that payment in the client's account or paid into the office account within.

259
00:39:52,890 --> 00:40:10,060
That certain amount. So I think it does. It's a logical procedure that if you're a solicitor and you know how to deal with clients' money, you're a lot better now than you were before when it really wasn't a mess. What you should do with it as well. It's the nature of the beast. We're much easier. We simply change the word should to must then.

260
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,080
Third last.

261
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:32,670
Failing which the payment must be paid into the client account. Instead of failing which the payment should, we change it to failing which the payment must be paid into client account, not later than the fifth working day. I'm happy with that. That will be consistent with the logic. And the legal adviser will be happy with it. I hope.

262
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:41,020
Thank you, Mr. Chan. The law society is happy with me. I'm very happy to keep the legal adviser happy. Okay, well, so everyone's happy.

263
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:56,770
兩小點。係，we are talking about the the fourth working day and the fifth working day. and I think the proper rendition should be第四個鐘工作日、第五個工作日，not四個工作日、五個工作日。

264
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,120
即係中文嗰度加翻個弟字。

265
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,820
the fourth working day, the fifth working day.

266
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,910
係。

267
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:16,740
的第的第係嘛？係係，即係中文嗰度咧就加翻的第四個工作天的，跟住後邊的第五個工作天。阿李小姐有冇問先？如果唔係中意問，好麻煩嘅。

268
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:29,140
冇問題。O K，一一問要happy，我happy。O K，嗱咁即係英文同中文都O K啦，即係大家都能夠接受啦。

269
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,210
係嘛？

270
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:37,120
其他委員冇問題啊嘛？呢度好，噉我哋去第三個啊。

271
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,750
爭議點咧，好嗎？OK。

272
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,390
Let's turn to page nine of the markup version.

273
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,930
要唔要轉？

274
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,190
yeah。

275
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,940
oblig obligation to keep accounts, yep.

276
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,690
Its obligation to keep accounts.

277
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,830
Here we have sent a letter to the law society inquiring what.

278
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:25,120
the last the qualification modifies the qualification is that are necessary for the operation of a mechanical or computerised system of bookkeeping. What that phrase modifies?

279
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:42,290
And then the solicitor law society comes back to us, telling us that that phrase modifies such cards, other permanent documents, and the information stored in a computer and retrievable in a permanent and feasible form.

280
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:52,230
So this is the English text, but if you look at the Chinese text, it doesn't reflect what is what is what the English text said.

281
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,630
嗯。

282
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,480
你講緊邊個字唔對啊？誒。

283
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,130
中文嗰度，誒，佢將機械報記同埋電腦報記拆咗。

284
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:29,290
誒，即係如果你睇英文咧，佢係that's necessary for the operation of a mechanical or computerised um system of bookkeeping。嗯。咁但係中文咧，佢就將

285
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,720
誒。

286
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,350
機械報記系統。

287
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,630
就拆咗落去中間，跟住又將電腦報記系統拆咗落去。

288
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,280
令到誒。

289
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,370
個中英文。

290
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,990
唔對稱，完全唔係唔係嗰樣嗰嗰回事。

291
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,220
李小姐，你幫唔幫到手？

292
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:07,260
呢個我諗，我哋要問翻D.O.J嗰度咧個law drafting嗰個呢個，因為啲涉及到technical terms。

293
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,990
誒。

294
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,930
或者啊，黃生。

295
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:33,200
我瞭解，即係我哋誒草業科嘅同事就覺得現時嗰個誒表述咧係冇問題。咁但係如果譬如話誒誒法律顧問係有意見，我哋可以即係請。如果轉達咗誒律師會，我哋可以翻去再再大家再睇下有冇啲咩可以進一步點樣再。我我我能夠睇到。

296
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:53,210
點解誒阿黃法律顧問係有個有個有個問題喺度嘅？咁如果可以嘅話，麻煩誒誒律政司嘅同事或者law誒或者可以可唔可以畀一個畀一個好啲嘅版本我哋得唔得？誒，我哋可以同誒誒律師會嗰邊達。

297
00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:13,220
大家即係即係配合啦，應該即係誒將頭先即係法律顧問提出嗰個關注點嗰度係另外一點咧，就係as the case may be。as the case may be咧，通常就係有幾個情況噉，跟住你就話as the case may be噉啊，擺喺尾嘅。但係而家你個用法就好奇怪咧，就係擺咗。

298
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:20,140
咁喺第三嗰個，你有一二三嘅，你擺喺第三嗰個項之前。

299
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,420
誒，其實嗰個咧得一個情況嘅，咁咧就係，你就話誒。

300
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:33,440
即係視乎情況，但係其實得一個情況，咁同埋其實亦都考慮翻有冇需要呢幾個字咯。

301
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,300
即係如果冇咗呢幾個字都得嘅，其實又冇需要。

302
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,700
即係as the case may be咧。

303
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,390
唔係咩？

304
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,710
ester case.

305
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:55,100
係啦，即係佢一係就hard copy，一係就即係佢其實而家我呢個係我tablet，其實tablet咗會容易睇咯，佢就擺咗喺呢度，其實通常係擺尾㗎嘛。

306
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,160
同埋有冇需要？

307
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:08,480
點解我會特別提到as the case may be咧？因為我同律師會嗰度誒就有個即係。

308
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:15,530
傾嘅過程裏面咧，佢就會講，亦需視乎情況，包括乜乜。

309
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:31,760
噉我就會提出咧個需其即視乎情況，其實唔係需咯。個需係係需當作包括誒shall be deemed to include，而唔係需視乎情況。

310
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,900
咁亦係。

311
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:43,640
Be is forwards, as the case may be. Would there be any difference if all these forwards are deleted? Can we just delete as the case may be? Is

312
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:53,980
Now my brain is racking as to how we got all of this, and I tell you why. I tell you why. Some people aren't very good at keeping their accounts.

313
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,970
And what they do is some firms who are sole proprietors, on the back of an envelope type of accounting.

314
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:20,620
And that's the reason maybe because you know people just do their records. They're not very good at doing it. But as a sole proprietor, they don't get any real advice and they create their account in a very vague way. So that was the answer why that was put in. But if you want to throw it out, I don't think it's going to cause me any problems. But it may cause people to be inexperienced. You know.

315
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:20,930
係。

316
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:41,410
Seven, you know, of the number of law firms in Hong Kong, most seventy percent sell propertors or you know partnerships, and they have a real problem in sometimes trying to get their accounts together. And some of them don't even do the accounts. We don't even deal with clients' money. Then all of a sudden they have clients' money. So that's why that word was put in there as well. As the case may be.

317
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,650
Can it go to the end of Route 10?

318
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,410
呃，是，C。

319
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:56,120
所以，我 put， as the case may be， at the very end of the third sub provision。

320
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:18,020
我 also want to read from a guide to styles and practices issued by the law drafting division of the DOJ. It says the expression as the case may be is often used unnecessarily in legal writing. Avoid it if, but if without it there can be ambiguity, consider recasting the provision.

321
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,510
So my question is: Is it necessary?

322
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,220
because we are talking about ten five.

323
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,080
水。

324
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,130
我found a case by be further out, didn't I?

325
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,120
真係幾好。

326
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,060
歷史。

327
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,450
係，我係。

328
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,530
而家咪睇緊。

329
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,020
I'm at the end. May work very well for me.

330
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:57,590
I think you can put it at the end. Actually, it'll have the same effect. Or as the case may be, at the very end, I'll be fine with that. It's what you do. Just put that. 好好。大家其他委員同意。

331
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,830
O.K.

332
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,880
yes，Miss Lee。

333
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,170
phrase as the case may be in Wu Ten Five。

334
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,930
put at the end of that subrule five， right？

335
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:21,500
Yes. Or my question is: Is it really necessary? Because even if you need it, it is usually put at the end of the sentence.

336
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:26,370
你你有 another case maybe in rule two or something.

337
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:34,300
my my my next question is is it really necessary, given the modern

338
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,210
trend of dropping.

339
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,470
但 if you look at Route Ten Sub Route Two,

340
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,030
The phrase, as the case may be, is in the middle, not at the end.

341
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,910
所以，That's why I think the OJ.

342
00:49:50,870 --> 00:50:10,880
I mean, Mr Cohen has already said that they have. You're you're happy to put it. I'm happy to put anything in which fee makes it easier and understandable, which it makes it. It does seem to be. I think it's sufficiently clear now if it's placed at the very end. I can put this at the very end. I don't think it makes any difference what.

343
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,700
I don't think we need to debate about where exactly, but at the end is fine. Mr. Wong.

344
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:36,000
誒利用呢個機會都係澄清啦，因為我相信嗰個稿並非D.O.J整理嘅，因為係律師會嗰邊整理。我哋就係從一個即係整體同嗰個法律個草擬方面嗰個格式有冇出入作為一個審核嘅標準。所以我我諗，如果當話係誒噉樣係因為係誒律政司嗰邊整理，我諗我我係想代表啲同事係情。

345
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,430
整翻呢樣嘢，應該就明白。所以如果譬如話有有方法去提升嗰個草業，我哋係冇問題。係多謝你，王先生。

346
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,220
咁點講？

347
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,020
嗯，我 have。

348
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:56,670
This would work, from my quick review. Okay, thank thank you, Mr. I have I have one more question on this.

349
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,800
Rule five.

350
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,060
嗯，啦。

351
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:23,450
它 mention such cards. We're looking at the left hand side, section 10 sub rule 5. Yes, in this rule each of the expressions, 好嘛？ Yes, book, ledger and record. Yes, shall be deemed to include a loose leaf book and such cards or other permanent documents. Such cards, such

352
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,890
誒。

353
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:34,590
Usually, when when the cast have been raised for a second time, you use such. But here, cast is raised for the first time.

354
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,590
所以誒。

355
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:50,880
should should it be changed to any or or what? Such cast here is raised for the first time. Shall be deemed to include reduced. So to say, such cast is is.

356
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:57,430
So instead of such, we use any, and then we cancel. Do we use card or cards?

357
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:14,380
cards because it's an old-fashioned bookkeeping thing where people put little things on the cards and it's very very old-fashioned so that's why we have that. Okay, so can we change the word such to any, so it reads any such cards or other permanent jobs? Yes, absolutely. Okay, thank you, Mr. Cohen.

358
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,680
係。

359
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,110
仲有一個係咪啊？

360
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,630
係。

361
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,610
我哋會唔會有其他方案？

362
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:50,430
unction of the word, with the phrase that are necessary for the operation of mechanical or computerised.

363
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,120
系統簿記。

364
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,050
是是connected with such。

365
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:03,790
因為如果 read the whole sentence together，such cards or other permanent documents，blah blah blah，and then come coming to the end。

366
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:07,270
That are necessary for the operation.

367
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:14,060
of a mechanical or computerised system of booking, so is the word such related to the?

368
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,270
this phrase，this clause。

369
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:28,770
Because I noted that the Chinese rendition they use Yamho. Oh, I see. Yeah. So and and because this is raised for the first time.

370
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,310
as long as it's clear.

371
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,260
Alright.

372
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:42,400
Going back to propose Rule 6A at page four of the markup version.

373
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:47,180
English and Chinese. English. English, page four.

374
00:53:47,970 --> 00:54:07,980
6A.利息 on client account.啊， yes. Here, enquiry have been made with the law society on on the words used, and the words are interest earned and interest accrued. For interest earned, they use賺取的利息. Interest accrued, they use顯

375
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,260
衍生的利息。

376
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:22,620
and I was asking whether there is any difference in the term used, and they replied no. and I just wonder whether the law society would consider adopting a single word.

377
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,350
when there was really no difference in the meaning.

378
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,360
Mr. Cohen。

379
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:52,430
Translation, pass it over. I don't, I can't answer that to be honest. It's not only translation because it's accrued and earned and accrued. Well, yeah, well, accrued interest is interest which will accrue on the account as it builds up over time. Earned interest is a specific amount which you may get.

380
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,090
立即。

381
00:54:53,690 --> 00:55:11,480
Interest earned is different from interest accrued, actually. So interest earned is the interest earned on the actual amount when you know that. The interest accrued is the rolling over paces as well. So this is why you know the rules. It's the English rules to me make a lot of sense, a lot of common sense. So you can translate it by all means.

382
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:31,770
But the crude and earned are slightly different because you're cruing it up all the time. That's one area. So it's interest upon interest. Earned is when you get the interest as well. But again, 0.0001% at the moment while while this is all suspended. It's academic. Yes. If that is the case, I will liaise with the law society on.

383
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:42,320
A consistent use of the word for interest earned and interest accrued for the Chinese, yes, fine. I'm very helpful. That'll be very, very helpful. 李小姐有冇補充？Very helpful to do that as well.

384
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,910
我有one more question。係，等等等，梁美芬議員係。

385
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,840
翻嚟咧就係話嗰個中文咧係咪用顯生咧，定係？

386
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,320
係咪積累？accumulate？

387
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,830
唔係一定係顯生嘅喎。

388
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:05,650
yeah，we are talking about the translation. I I I totally agree your explanation。衍生係咪derived啊？

389
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:22,430
啊，Yeah， accrue唔唔係翻譯做衍生，I I don't think so，應該係累積出嚟就accrue，Right？唔緊要，我哋derived呀，derived is the English word，所以可能可能中文嗰度誒，你中文執一執佢。

390
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,120
就應計利息啊！

391
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:42,120
誒，我查過誒字典咧，《A Glossary of Financial Terms》呢度係用咗誒誒大陸、誒香港同台灣嘅用語都有比較嘅。噉佢interest accrued咧，佢係用英計。

392
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:58,980
利息噉我亦都留意到法例裡面咧，如果interest accrue類似嘅情況咧，佢係用累算利息。嗯，因為我係啦，因為我諗誒普通市民睇衍生其實係唔睇唔到accrue嗰個意思，睇唔到嚇。

393
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:06,360
因為我哋雷曼成日衍生工具係講緊另，即係講緊另外一樣嘢。阿李小姐，O唔O K啊？明唔明白？

394
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:17,620
我明白嚇嚇，明白。噉我諗睇下一次過，我諗係誒legal個誒legal adviser會畀翻封信，我哋set out曬呢啲。

395
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:37,950
唔係嗱，唔需要咁複雜嘅，因為頭先我哋已經講咗，我哋同意同埋想修改啲咩啊。頭先委員同埋誒誒律政司嘅同事都已經講清楚㗎啦。噉我諗唔需要話又整一輪書信噉樣，因為噉樣嘥大家時間。不如咧，如果我建議能夠嘅話咧，就係誒我哋會後誒。

396
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:49,260
誒，你哋大家坐低去再講一次，因為因為已經其實其實頭先得三點啫嘛嚇，我我都記得係乜嘢，所以我諗唔需要再整書信啦，應該冇。

397
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:54,390
誒，仲有一點，仲有一點，係，仲有一點，嗯，誒，page four。

398
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,480
Ruleset say，誒on subparagraph three B。

399
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:05,560
here it mentions on receipt of the client's request for a certificate.

400
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:14,930
and and then the council must do something, and here I'm just asking for the time frame because it's um.

401
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,490
跌倉松。

402
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:24,960
must do something on receipt of the client's request. And here the rendition in Chinese is.

403
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,460
在接獲後。

404
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,790
and talks about a time frame.

405
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,200
is not.

406
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,260
在接獲時。

407
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,530
所以我 just wondering。

408
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,850
what is the time frame?

409
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,520
或，你 refering to

410
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:50,370
um a specific point of time or a period of time, because the use of how

411
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:57,410
is more refers to a a period of time rather than a specific point of time.

412
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:09,260
and I must mention that on an or in on another occasion in the same rule, when on receipt of is used, the rendition is交代獲悉。

413
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:19,870
translation.

414
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,250
係，係，係。

415
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:34,800
I think the issue is the council must investigate and it will investigate as it you know.

416
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:55,090
In the time frame, things fit. I mean, it's like many issues with the law council. Someone says you must, you know, in a disciplinary matter, the council must do this. It's not saying it must do it within one day, two days, three days. It must investigate, and in due course, it will issue its certificate. I don't think you're going to put in time periods for the council. We must do it within so many.

417
00:59:55,090 --> 01:00:03,510
day so many days so many days, it's rather like in one of the disciplinary proceedings, you you may if you you must do A B and C, you know you do it.

418
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,850
That's how I look at it.

419
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,390
我部咧比冇。

420
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,530
accurate，accurate to say after after receipt of。

421
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,840
Because on seems to point to a point a specific point of time.

422
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,000
I mean, that sounds to make a lot of sense. After after receipt, it it it will do that. Okay.

423
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:44,910
解決咗我問題。seems seems acceptable to me and members，我都係問同一個問題。因為因為呀，because I think we need to give time to the council。yeah， I mean you can't。yeah， you can't say as when as at they upon receipt。yeah， upon receipt。啊，咁中文使唔使改啊？

424
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,880
誒，佢中文而家已經係在接獲後㗎啦。哦，咁after receipt會準啲。係。

425
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,450
O.K.，咁大家同意就得。

426
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,450
係。

427
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,040
誒係咁多。

428
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,140
After a seat, that's fine.

429
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,270
誒。

430
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:26,150
一五一係咁多啦。係，誒，That's it for one five one。

431
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,690
Four, so we move on to one five two.

432
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:32,900
係。

433
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,440
一五二。

434
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:50,940
Again, we only focus on the really controversial parts, and for the other parts, we heard Mr. Wong said that the DOJ is doesn't have any issue with any particular bit.

435
01:01:51,220 --> 01:02:03,740
of the proposed rules, and we'll take it that the government is happy with it. And unless the law society wishes to change it, we'll leave it as it is. But subject to what Miss Wong, the legal adviser, has to say. Okay? Yes.

436
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:22,300
on page one of LN one five two, my only enquiry is on the use of儲蓄帳户for deposit account when that word is already used for as the rendition for savings account.

437
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:27,390
and I would ask the law society to consider using.

438
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,780
啊！存款賬户。

439
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,180
as in the banking ordinance.

440
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,180
我哋睇緊一五二嘅中文版。

441
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,140
嘅第二段嗰個啊！

442
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:45,090
第幾行？誒，under client account，係啦。

443
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,550
用儲蓄帳户。

444
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:51,860
你就可以。

445
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,610
應該存款帳，應該存款賬户。

446
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,460
儲蓄同存款。

447
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,300
儲蓄同。

448
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:18,770
嗯。

449
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,420
律師公會話。

450
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,630
要開個 normal bank account，因為

451
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,390
Look at it carefully. Client account means.

452
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,310
It's a current current council deposit account.

453
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,180
用唔用銀行 account？

454
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,470
I mean, the English looks good to me. I can make no comments on the Chinese translation.

455
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,970
李小姐，但係誒。

456
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,940
儲蓄帳户個。

457
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:59,250
嗰個係咪廣闊一啲咧？因為如果存就用存款賬户，好似淨係擺入去。

458
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,740
誒。

459
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:18,650
你説明 to me to us in your letter that deposit account is wider than saving account, but since there are two words deposit account and saving account in the rules, um.

460
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,260
maybe we should also use two words for.

461
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:33,810
the rendition，just as in the banking ordinance，they also use two different Chinese words for deposit account and savings account。

462
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,700
所以，我問，maybe we should achieve consistency.

463
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:58,790
點解係存款賬户？存款賬户，我我明白喎，李小姐，存款賬户係比較比較闊少少喎，呢個呢個字眼係能夠概括誒多唔同類型嘅嘅嘅嘅賬户，多個多個就咁儲蓄喎，因為儲蓄就係淨係saving啫嘛。

464
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,330
係。

465
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,190
呢個High Court Ordinance都係啲，明白，明白。

466
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:11,400
即係即係律師會冇問題係咪？嚇可以改委員有冇問題？

467
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,130
O.K.

468
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:24,230
係啦，改中文嗰個由儲蓄帳户改成存誒存款帳户，噉就比較闊少少。

469
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,000
咁一五三。

470
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,010
最後。

471
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,070
係，我知。

472
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,890
I just like to know what is the.

473
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,570
sticking to the meaning of client account only to accounts.

474
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,330
Located in a bank in Hong Kong.

475
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,340
reason for that is when it comes to disciplinary matters.

476
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:19,630
We've had real, real problems with people putting their clients' account out of Hong Kong. When we come to intervene or deal with matters, you cannot get the information, nor can we get control of the bank. For example, I've been appointed intervention agent on many occasions. The real problem is getting in and getting control of the bank accounts. Could you imagine trying to get into control of bank?

477
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:33,840
accounts in BVI's in other countries as well, and we wouldn't have any ability to control or look after the clients' monies in the event of intervention. So the main objective is to keep the bank accounts in Hong Kong to protect the people of the public of the metropolis of Hong Kong. As simple as that.

478
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:54,130
So, so the legal consequence of this rule is that a solicitor firm shall not deposit clients' money in overseas account. Correct. So, they need to. Yes, absolutely. Because when we, I mean, when we come for difficulties, when we have to intervene, as you've seen, and it's been coming quite a few recently, and I've become an intervention agent.

479
01:06:54,130 --> 01:07:14,140
I have enough trouble getting an order from a Hong Kong court to get control of it. So can you imagine trying to get a control of a bank account and if in BVI and if somebody got smart and put it in some weird place, we could get no money out of it. We could be left chasing our arms for a long, long time. So that's why we changed the rules for that. But there is a waiver provision in Rule Fifteen. Yes.

480
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:34,150
How is he going to do? Well, for waivers, like anything for waivers of rules, like for the accounts, you've got to come with a very, very good reason to waive, and it's up to the council to consider waiving things in respect to matters. So it has to be dealt with on application. On application for waivers for everything, it's quite common in all the other rules.

481
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:53,380
So in other words, the solicitor cannot shall not deposit clients' money in an overseas account even on clients' instructions. Yes, correct, absolutely. Unless there is a waiver. Unless there's a waiver, and the chance of that being given, I think will be won't be ever be given. I can't see that happening.

482
01:07:54,100 --> 01:08:06,700
And that becomes the reason why that came in is that I I made sure that came in because when I did an intervention, people lost their money and we couldn't get the money because the account was in the middle, really in the middle of where was it? Spain.

483
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:27,060
你知道，係真係某啲非常愚蠢嘅嘢。然後你試過想控制銀行賬户喺西班牙，所以啲人話：，為咩會發生呢？，因為我哋唔控制我哋嘅成員，所以就係噉。但係喺實施呢個規則之前，蘇利斯特可以做嘅嘢，可以嗎？可以。可以

484
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,890
But there's been some. We changed. We no, we did a practice direction out saying they can't. Correct.

485
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:55,330
Yeah, before the change was ambiguity in respect of all of this, but we've made it very clear. I think there was a practice direction that came out saying that you can't do it, so you're in breach of the practice direction. I see. I think a practice direction came out some time, but we need to get this into the rules to stop this happening. And this is quite an important one, which you know, yeah, we need to do.

486
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:56,930
Thank you.

487
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:17,540
I understand from Ms. Wong. Thank you very much, Ms. Wong. That we have come to an end of the controversial issues, so there are no more. And given what the DOJ has said that the Law Society proposed amendments to the rules are all acceptable.

488
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:30,730
save for the four points which we've just discussed, and which you have agreed to go away and amend. Now let me consult with the secretary to see how we could do it, because there are some time limitations.

489
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:54,640
視乎委員會覺唔覺得啊？主席視乎委員會覺唔覺得有需要再開一次會，係睇翻誒嗰啲嘅修訂。如果係誒大家係覺得誒可以先係誒傳越先嚇，咁傳越咗之後，或者誒如果有委員覺得有需要係開會先至安排會議都得。咁但係因為我。

490
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:13,400
我哋嗰個審議期咧係誒係係好問㗎啦，噉就已經係延展咗，噉係去到誒十月五號，噉我哋咧即係話要喺十一月二十三號咧就要向內會係提交報告㗎啦，咁而議員提出誒誒修訂嘅預告期咧，最遲係十一月二十八號嘅。

491
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:22,660
嚇，噉我哋誒，如果係需要開會，即係話咧，盡最好咧，就係喺十一月二十三號之前誒開會嚇。

492
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:34,820
主席啊！主席，係唔好即係我諗傳譯咧，一整番嘢好簡單，同埋都好技術性。係啊，係啊。如果大家同意咧，你傳譯，我哋大家冇問題，噉就唔好開會啦。咁其他委員有冇意見？

493
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:56,160
嚇唔使再開會啦，噉我哋就咁傳閲啦。噉就麻煩律師會咧，係將嗰個頭先我哋同意咗改嗰啲修訂咧，就畀一畀秘書處。噉我哋就傳閲嚇。咁如果委員冇意見咧，我哋就可以誒唔需要再開會啦，就可以我係咪要做個博？係啦，誒向內。

494
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:16,170
會做一個報告嚇，就話已經係冇其他嘅誒意見同收。Do this very very quickly. Um, what we've said, we've drafted the amendments just in right now, so it will take hopefully within the next 24 hours we can get something out. I think Andrew's looking very strongly at me now, a little bit longer than that. You just ruin her next few days. No no no no no, I haven't, because we got like we're over.

495
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:36,180
I got overseas lawyers qualifying examination tomorrow, so I got to get this done before I have to start. I think it's in the interest of everyone that Law Society really come up with the agreed amendments within the next few days, so that we could circulate within the members and the subcommittee, and then we'll hopefully pass it without further comments and objections.

496
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,740
And now.

497
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,980
Thank you, Miss Lang.

498
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,090
嗯。

499
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,640
冇其他嘢。

500
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,070
我講。

01:11:47,700 --> 01:12:02,590
Oh, Mr. Cohen. Yes. I've just been reminded by the secretariat that please provide both English and Chinese versions when you give us the amendments that has been agreed on just now.

502
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,740
O.K.

503
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,810
Yeah, thank you.

504
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,140
手做工廠，你全部。

505
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:16,070
And also, and Miss Wong has suggested that you provide an information note explaining.

506
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:31,750
But look for for future references, so that we could save some time. Instead of asking you these questions here, we would know in advance the meaning behind your your suggested proposals. Thank you.

507
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,070
We take on board those comments. We'll do.

508
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,930
有冇？

509
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:40,780
其他委員有冇問題？冇。OK，散會。
