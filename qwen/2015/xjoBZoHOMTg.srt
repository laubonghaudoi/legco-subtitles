30
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,570
Professor Christopher Gain誒係發言嘅，Professor Christopher Gain，please。

31
00:06:49,410 --> 00:07:07,910
Thank you very much indeed, Chair. We are at slight disadvantage in that we've only just seen this this paper here and haven't had the opportunity to review it. Nonetheless, I think the broad principles of the matter that that is under discussion just now are probably quite well understood.

32
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,390
The question of how one deals with judicial misconduct is something which is

33
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:24,340
viewed as with considerable as raising raising matters of considerable sensitivity in most jurisdictions, and it's very important that whatever the procedures adopted.

34
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:39,030
look like they are able to balance the natural and appropriate interests of individuals who feel that a judge at whatever level in a particular case has behaved inappropriately.

35
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,550
That needs to be balanced, of course, with the need to maintain appropriate respect for the judicial office.

36
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,910
I think that one of the very important questions that needs to be considered here.

37
00:07:51,200 --> 00:08:01,140
是extent to which investigation of judicial misconduct is a matter that should be left entirely in the hands of the judiciary.

38
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:11,130
或whether or not it is appropriate to consider mechanisms which allow an appropriate lay involvement in dealing with matters of this kind.

39
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:27,190
That may be regarded by some as perhaps an innovation, and some may actually regard it as being inappropriate. But on the other hand, we need to recognise that judges above a certain level are, of course.

40
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,270
appointed。

41
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:49,560
by a process which involves lay participation, and my own view is that there is nothing wrong in principle with some lay involvement in the process of reviewing the conduct of individual judges and determining whether or not that conduct conforms.

42
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,690
至高標準的 judicial behaviour， which would be expected in a jurisdiction such as Hong Kong.

43
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:06,420
There are elements of lay participation in other systems outside Hong Kong. I think that that when lay participation is included, on the other hand,

44
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:19,730
It needs to be included in a way that allows the individuals concerned to believe that they are exercising some independent input into the system, which is not always achieved in some other jurisdictions.

45
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,120
嗯。

46
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,870
I think also there is an important question about the extent to which

47
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:45,160
processes of investigation can only be based on formal complaint, or whether there are other appropriate ways of allowing concerns about the conduct of particular judicial officers to be raised, even in the absence of a formal complaint. Again, provisions.

48
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,700
That do allow this do exist in in systems outside Hong Kong.

49
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:58,180
但overall，the general point I think that is needs to be made is that。

50
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:18,470
The kinds of complaints that I think are properly under discussion here are matters that are entirely separate from the question of whether or not any individual or group of individuals agrees with the decisions that judges have taken in a given case, or even the pattern of decision making from a

51
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,840
given in a given court.

52
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:35,510
where the concern is about that kind of matter, there are appropriate mechanisms in place for the individuals concerned. In a case, there is always the available routes of appeal.

53
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:55,910
And for those who are not involved in the case but still think that the judges are getting it wrong, then there is in a sense many opportu there are many opportunities for people to voice those concerns. And if those concerns ultimately are shared and shown to be well founded, then again in a system such as Hong Kong.

54
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:15,920
The resolution of those kinds of complaints lies with the legislature, and that's the my opinion is the appropriate way to deal with these matters. Thank you。好，多謝阿Professor King。咁跟住咧就係我哋係請大律師公會嘅代表係阿石永泰主席係發。

55
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,570
出現嘅。

56
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,570
多謝主席。

57
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:38,370
I would speak briefly, and I would then leave it to my colleague, Mr. P. Y. Low, to perhaps supplement on any points that he wish he wishes to add.

58
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,540
We have read the administration's paper.

59
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,430
prepared for the purpose of this hearing.

60
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,700
嗯。

61
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,950
In short.

62
00:11:50,230 --> 00:12:03,490
Our views are that judicial independence is a very important facet of the system in Hong Kong.

63
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:13,310
and in connection with the point about lay participation in the investigation of complaints against judicial conduct.

64
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,210
We agree with the paper put forward by the judiciary.

65
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,910
In particular, page three at paragraph eight.

66
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,310
畀我睇下。

67
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,570
That because of the need to ensure.

68
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,990
司法獨立，both in substance and as a matter of perception。

69
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:51,700
and also because of the peculiar constitutional framework in Hong Kong, the provisions of Article 89, we do not believe that it is appropriate that there should be what one calls lay participation in the process of investigation. Now it could well be said.

70
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,350
That a system whereby judges

71
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:02,920
或有些有説，那啲現有的系統，涉及法官自己調查。

72
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:13,350
但係，答案 to that is that if institutionally we trust our judges to dispense justice without fear or favour.

73
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:32,690
在 matters concernin disputes between the state and the people, there is no good reason in principle why we should not trust the same judges to dispense justice without fear or favour when it concerns a complaint against their own. After all, in dealing with appeals.

74
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,500
judges are having to pass judgement on the correctness and sometimes the conduct.

75
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:50,940
of their learned judicial brothers, but it has never been said that because in hearing an appeal, judges are being called upon to say that their learned brothers are wrong, there should be some kind of lay participation.

76
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:59,460
所以，它 may well be said that other places do things differently. But in the particular context of Hong Kong, we believe we that

77
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:07,420
judicial independence, both substantive and perceived, plus the constitutional framework of Hong Kong.

78
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:16,770
go against allowing lay participation. Perhaps I should now pass to P Y Lo to see whether he has anything to add.

79
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,950
subject to the leave of

80
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,340
嘅。

81
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:40,520
係多係多謝主席。誒，用少少時間嚟講，係提一提咧，就係誒，我哋香港嚟講係有一份咧公開咗嘅關於係法官操守嘅守則。呢一份守則嚟講咧，就係誒一九就係二零零四年誒。

82
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:48,660
就係通過一個專責小組完成咗，亦都嚟講咧喺最近嘅時間嚟講係修訂過嘅。

83
00:14:48,940 --> 00:15:08,950
噉就呢一份嘅守則嚟講咧，係公開嘅，亦都係畀到公眾可以睇到咧，係誒公誒法官嘅嗰個嘅誒要維持專業水平應該有嘅準則，亦都嚟講咧係請啊各位議員咧留意咧。二零零九年首席法官喺法律年度開啓典位裏邊有。

84
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:28,960
遊演辭嗰度咧，係誒提及過咧，各級法院所有法官都明白到，佢哋工作表現時刻受到輿論監察，佢哋啲深明司法機構嘅整體聲譽係喺於每位法官都能夠保持高嘅專業水平。輿論監察呢樣嘢同公開審訊係啊誒互相嚟講緊扣嘅噉嘅各。

85
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:45,670
咁應該咁咧，係國誒國級嘅法院嚟講翻，明白到呢一點嘅誒，噉就嚟講咧，當然嚟講係現時咧司法機構嘅建議嚟講，係包括一啲提高透明度嘅係誒，同埋效率嘅一啲嘅係誒。

86
00:15:45,950 --> 00:16:00,610
誒考慮嘅啊，工作嘅係誒要點喺度啦。噉啊，希望嚟講咧，就係我哋喺誒將來會見到一啲嚟講咧係誒提高呢方呢兩方面嘅係成果嘅。唔該，主席。

87
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,290
好，誒。

88
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:23,610
咁咧就跟住係誒下一個團體，就係中澳港法學交流會嘅前志容先生。係啊，各位係噉啊，其實咧就好多foundation嘅嘢啦，就係比識攞啊八十九已經講得好清楚㗎啦。其實有曬個機制。

89
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,760
咁加上連cap四三三咧，亦講得好清楚，嗰個position係有喺度㗎啦。

90
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:44,420
咁如果呢樣嘢係大眾唔同意嘅話咧，噉我覺得應該咧就係睇個fundamental嗰個principle，whatever喺度話個系統有問題嘅。好啦，咁咧就。

91
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,400
其實啊，Commission Law嗰個basic law都講明可以揾第二啲judge嚟到啊，其實都好open㗎啦。

92
00:16:50,680 --> 00:17:00,710
噉就我都係legal practitioner嚟嘅，咁咧我只能夠講咧就只能夠有一個好嘅系統嘅啫，就冇一個perfect嘅system嘅。

93
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:19,290
咁咧就我所知咧就啊common law咧就成啊好好咗成千年前嘅Roman Empire啦，就已經一路一路噉樣治到今日㗎啦。你話如果想一個revolutionary咁去大改咧，我就覺得就無需要嘅，就唔realistic嘅。

94
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,320
好啦，由頭到尾都係嗰個common law都好清晰咧，就reduce independence嘅。

95
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,070
噉啊，包括appointment啦，同埋唔能夠畀佢influence by嗰啲executive啦。

96
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:51,400
噉樣咧，就去secure佢嘅聽療咧，當然係好重要嘅嚇。誒，對唔住，田生誒，我哋咧就頭先翻譯都有提到咧，希望儘量你翻譯埋做中文嚇。噉佢就一次過係翻譯做英文，好唔好？好啊，明白。我盡量嚇。噉啊，其實好好多年嘅。

97
00:17:51,400 --> 00:18:11,410
誒嘅已經肯定咗咧，就係嗰個司法就要獨立㗎啦，好好普通嘅嘢嘅，同埋唔能夠畀嗰啲誒誒政治啊各方面去影響嘅，例如誒政府員工啊噉樣嘅。咁同埋最基本有有一個immunity嗰啲叫做即係誒誒免免免責嗰啲噉嘅嘢。咁而

98
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:31,420
我哋人類都好多時候都有需要去平衡嘅，咁而亦有一啲好清晰嘅喺法律嘅authority咧，就啲案例咧，就相信好多人都知嘅，就係康果嗰嗰單嗰單case啦。噉佢嗰度就借用英國個案例咧，就Philippine Admiral嗰度話都明嘅。

99
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:51,430
啦，唔需要去困去啊問嗰啲啊executive啦，即係嗰啲政治嘅執行嗰啲人。如果唔係咧，就會變咗係一個啊啊啊啊political，即係嗰啲啊啊法啊政治嘅一種好重要嘅去救急啊，咁去影響。

100
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,140
響嘅。

101
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,510
好啦，咁至於咧。

102
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:14,800
就個問題就係話嗰個法官咧，需唔需要向個誒社會交代啦？噉樣就我相信好清楚咧，就係誒嗰個嘅誒誒法制咧，就唔係表示係民主，我可以乜都得，要揭曬出嚟噉樣嘅。咁咧就。

103
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:34,810
啊！嗰個法官佢決定嘅嘢咧，就唔應該有政府嘅影響嘅政治嘅影響嘅。咁咧，現時咧，我感覺到係足夠嘅大家嘅制衡嘅。好啦，噉啊，最唔好一樣嘢咧，就係當能夠個社會無端端係有一個叫做。

104
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:42,330
個期望點樣去判？一期望唔到啦，噉就周街嘈啦，咁咪變咗咧？就我認為係亂嘅。

105
00:19:42,620 --> 00:20:02,630
噉啊！至於咧，有人提出過咧，就應該係係透明到一啲，去監察一啲complain嘅，去投訴法官嘅。噉我當然係好啦嚇。咁但係咧，太過透明咧，就會阻礙到。同埋咧，我相信都好似審翻法官咁啦。

106
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:22,640
啦，我就係唔同意嘅。噉啊，永遠都係一個平衡嘅，去到邊一個代價嚟去做咁解嘅啫。啊，點解要高一高官畀個法院？點解個官係有權講嘢先嘅噉樣？好啦，呢啲就好基本嘅嘢嚟嘅。我覺得就憑我嘅經驗啦，任何一個人如果唔滿意。

107
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:39,150
個官咧係有曬個機制去投訴嘅，咁而官咧通常就喺喺喺啲大律師嗰度揀一啲嗰啲係最叻嗰啲嘅，我亦相信佢哋係有噉嘅判斷力，係好專業嘅。噉我有好多時候見有啲官咧判一啲好重嘅。

108
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:59,490
好可能佢睇到嘢，我睇唔到喎。我哋唔能夠話個官嘅。有陣時，我感覺判得好輕嘅，我就唔能夠話個官好人嘅。可能佢睇到嘅，我哋睇唔到啦。好啦，咁同埋咧就好多時候，嗰個律嗰個法官可能佢講嘅語氣係影響個律師嘅，但我未見到。

109
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:18,510
嗰個法官鬧完嗰個律師，或者comment個律師，係會判一個好重嘅刑。我見佢哋個個都好公正嘅。佢講完佢嘅意見，佢會判得好公正。就算佢判你有刑、有判你有罪啊，噉佢鬧講清係啱嘅，我覺得。

110
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:31,610
好多謝阿錢生。咁跟住咧就係啊司法事務關注運動嘅黃克明先生咧就誒嚟咗啦。噉我哋而家請阿黃克明先生。

111
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,170
主席，各位，我同大家分享幾點，非常簡單。

112
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,000
第一。

113
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:52,610
司法獨立嘅意義咧，係在於法官能夠在不受幹擾嘅情況之下，透過對案件嘅裁決，依法執行社會公義。

114
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,670
司法獨立嘅存在嘅最終目的。

115
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:09,760
係使到法治得以保護，唔係法官得以保護。換句話講，司法獨立只係具有工具性嘅意義，係冇終極嘅自身嘅意義。

116
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,580
適當嘅司法措手。

117
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:20,650
會因為紀律問責性嘅不足，而對法治構成損害。

118
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,390
司法嘅紀律問責性嘅健全。

119
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,660
有賴於兩個重要條件嘅存在。

120
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,960
第一係具有權威嘅約束力嘅法官操守守則。

121
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,140
第二，對於呢一個守則嘅。

122
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,390
獨立。

123
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,620
同埋有效嘅執行。

124
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,790
司法措守守則。

125
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,760
需要透過立法確立佢嘅約束性。

126
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,080
如果司法措守守則。

127
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,550
只係由司法當局制定同埋執行，權力會過於集中而趨向絕對化。

128
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,200
喺基本法嘅框架之內，需要建構獨立嘅機制。

129
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:21,470
對一切法律所界定嘅不當司法措手，進行徹底嘅調查同埋追究，以保衞社會嘅法治同埋市民嘅利益。多謝主席。

130
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:41,260
係，誒，你仲有時間或者你誒冇補充啦？嗱，咁咧就誒，我哋咧而家就係委員嘅誒時間啦。咁現時暫時就有三位嘅委員係示意發言，仲有邊幾位暫時係會想發言嘅？

131
00:23:42,000 --> 00:24:02,010
噉我哋都係每一位四分鐘先啦。有時間大家可以繼續追問，好冇？咁第一位咧就係阿湯嘉華議員。誒，多謝多謝主席。誒，主席好多時候咧就誒，即係市民對於即係司法獨立嗰個概念啊，可能唔係完全理解噉。我都係每一次都希望可以講得更加清楚一啲嘅。

132
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:22,440
主席，如果法官係判錯案，甚至乎畀當事人覺得有所偏頗咧，依啲都唔係啊應該受到懲處或者甚至罷免嘅原因嚟嘅，因為誒判錯案或者甚至乎表面上有所偏頗呢啲問題咧，係應該由上訴機制咧去矯正。

133
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:32,990
一個獨立司法獨立嘅系統咧，係要確保唔會法官唔會因為社會某一啲人或者某一誒少數人，甚至多數人。

134
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:53,280
嘅誒唔認同咧，而影響佢嘅誒誒處理案件嘅誒嘅能力。主席，我執業大約四十年啦，我所記得嘅只係有三宗法官咧，係因為個行為不當而被要求誒誒呢個辭職，或者係誒早啲誒要求佢誒退休嘅。

135
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,760
第一宗咧，就有個法官咧，就同一個即係訴訟雙方其中一方去澳門賭錢，仲要兩個人住埋一間房。

136
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,050
咁大家咧瞭解到，就非常之令到司法界蒙羞。

137
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,200
第二單咧，就有一法官咧，就喺審案嘅時候睇小説。

138
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,000
呢個佢自認嘅，亦都係令到我哋司法界蒙羞。

139
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:26,950
第三單咧，就係佢嗰個資歷嗰方面咧，佢唔誠實，係誒冇服役，佢就話佢自己服咗役，咁亦都係因此咧係被法誒法庭咧係要求佢提早退休。

140
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:47,240
依三宗咧，都同佢判案對或者不對咧，係完全無關嘅。甚至乎咧，誒，最得喺度喺後面嗰兩誒嗰兩位法官咧，我哋法律界都公認咧，佢哋判案咧係誒誒中規中矩嘅。甚至乎係有啲人係讚佢哋判案判得好嘅。咁所以大家要瞭解到咧。

141
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,120
法官出錯同佢判案出錯咧，係兩回事嚟嘅。

142
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:02,180
咁第二點，我想趁呢個機會澄清下，我好多謝前前先生嘅誒嘅嘅言論咧。誒，其實我上一次講可能講得唔係太清楚。

143
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:09,740
我係主張咧，係誒法庭去自我糾正嘅機制咧，係應該要透明度。

144
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:30,030
但係，我意思唔係話喺個矯矯正機制嘅時嘅當中咧，誒每一個誒進行嘅內容咧係應該要公佈出嚟。我覺得誒一個矯正嘅機制，首先係要講清楚畀香港市民聽，有呢個機制嘅存在，呢個機制係點樣運作，依個係要有透明度。

145
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:50,040
甚至乎可能咧，喺呢個機制被啟動嘅時候咧，都應該係有透明度，即係話有人知道呢個機制已經被啟動啦。但係之後咧，為咗確保呢個誒司法獨立咧，我又唔認同咧喺啟動咗呢個機制之後嘅每一步，包括個調查嘅內容或者係誒任何嘅誒。

146
00:26:50,040 --> 00:27:02,980
雙方嘅論點咧係應該要公開，我覺得依個係好容易咧，係被誒依個誒公眾咧誤認為咧係某啲批評嘅理由咧係可以令到咧法官咧係被罷免或者係。

147
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:23,400
因此咧，係要退下嚟。噉我覺得依個對於我哋嘅司法獨立咧係誒冇乜幫助嘅。啊，主席，我誒睇過阿黃毓民同埋阿梁國雄誒議員誒所提交嘅文件。誒，我再一次重申咧，我喺目前咧，我唔覺得誒佢哋嗰個投訴咧係屬於我頭先一開。

148
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:43,410
開始發言嘅時候，個後者即係話嗰個法官嘅誒，即係誒不當嘅行為。佢哋可能認為個法官嘅判決未未如理想，依個係一個上訴機制可以矯正嘅，就唔係一個咧係誒要誒要誒要求要罷免或者係要求佢誒作。

149
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:53,150
一啲懲處行為嘅一個基礎噉啊，或者我誒誒表達意見到呢度啦，主席。好，跟住係有黃毓民議員。

150
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:13,710
多謝主席。嗱，關於湯家華對我哋嗰封信嗰個即係質疑咧，一陣間等阿長毛同佢傾啦嚇。我就針對個制度嘅啫。OK啊，既然大家即係今日呢個議程係列咗，即係嚇講個機制啊，針即係處理即係對法官行為嘅投訴機制，我哋就針對個制度嚟講啦嚇。

151
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:33,760
嗱，司法獨立固然係好重要，但係彰顯法治先係一個終極嘅目標啊！司法獨立唔應該成為妨礙維護法治、保障個人權利同埋自由嘅藉口嚟嘅。司法機構必須完設立完善同埋公開透明嘅機制，處理涉及法官行為同埋品格操守投訴，不能以司法獨立不受幹。

152
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
如推黨係接受監察，係咪啊？

153
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:56,260
嗱，關於嗰個即係司法機構提供嘅文件第五段嗰個簡介裏邊咧，嗱，誒A嗰度話司法機構話咧，針對司法判決投訴唔應該按照投訴機制嚟處理，嗱呢個當然係一個基本原則嚟嘅，係我哋同意嘅。但係我哋唔可以排除喺某啲情況底下，法官嘅行為同埋品格嘅操守，佢係影響程序公。

154
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:16,270
而而令到嗰個司法判決受到法律嘅挑戰，所以兩類投訴不能互相排斥。當事人有權自行決定是否提出司法上訴，我哋要尊重。但係我哋唔可以過早斷定，針對司法判決投訴必然係不應該按照呢個投訴機制嚟處理嘅。正如謝偉俊喺二零一三年七月二。

155
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:36,280
十三日喺個會議上邊講，佢話受屈嘅人可能冇法律代表，喺某啲情況之下要分辨呢一兩類嘅性質不同，而可能並存嘅投訴係唔容易嘅，係咪？所以基於社會對司法人員有更高嘅要求，我哋討論呢啲相關問題嘅時候咧，係必須要好謹慎嘅，就唔係大曬一句司法獨立。O.K.嗱。

156
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:44,330
喺第五段裏邊又講佢話，事實上咧就司法機構接獲大部分或者好多投訴係針對司法判決，唔係針對法官嘅行為。

157
00:29:44,610 --> 00:30:04,620
嗱，但係我哋睇翻司法機構政務處喺二零一三年七月廿三日嘅會議上向本會提供嘅資料咧，就顯示不同嘅情況。二零一二年司法機構總共接獲一百二十六宗投訴，七十四宗同司法判決有關，三十一宗同法官行為有關，另外廿一宗咧係同兩者相關。你計下個。

158
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,470
百分比咧，即係同法官相關嘅投訴係佔咗四十一點二七個percent。

159
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:21,990
司法當局冇喺文件列出詳細嘅數據嘅，咁然後咧好籠統就話畀我聽，大部分或者好多投訴係針對司法判決，唔係針對法官嘅行為。嗱，呢個有誤導本委員會之嫌。

160
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:42,420
你我想講啊，呢個第八十九啊，因為我時間有限，其實我即係誒好長嘅，不過我擺上網嘅啦，OK？誒喺文卷第八段裏邊咧，交代咗中審法院首席法官嘅立場，就以基本法第八十九條嚟做擋箭牌，力拒由非法官組成嘅機制處理呢個對法官嘅投訴。我哋認為。

161
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,440
係中審法院首席法官曲解第八十九條。

162
00:30:45,890 --> 00:31:05,900
嗱，第八十九條針對嘅對法官醫院免職嘅機制，就處理一般嘅投訴。八十九條係不禁止其他模式嘅機制，但係該等機制不能作為對有關法官醫院免職嘅決定。第二，因此另外設立機制處理投訴，即係針對法官嘅投訴。如果投訴成立，情節嚴重，可以而需。

163
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:25,910
要考慮對有關法官、醫院免職嘅時候，再進行《基本法》第八十九條嘅程序，亦無不可。第三，《第八十九條》之中有關不少於三名當地法官組成嘅審議庭，並冇排除其他人加入審議庭嘅可能性。當然係包括本地嘅退休法官、其他普通法司法管轄區嘅法官同。

164
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:45,920
為一本永久性居民，係咪？所以呢個係有問題嘅。嗱，另外咧，誒，應本委員會嘅要求咧，司法機構政務處咧就喺誒二零一三年七月廿三日會議同意提供以下嘅資料，但係我哋而家睇唔到一啲進一步嘅資料，我唔知即係我我自己就冇睇到啦。誒，第一係接受裁判。

165
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,960
司法任命前，未曾誒出任執業。

166
00:31:49,240 --> 00:32:09,250
律師嘅裁判官人數。第二，其他司法管咧，佢而家處理針對法官行為嘅投訴機制。第三，過去三年轉介司法人員推薦委員會以公知照嘅投訴個案數目，以及其後就該等個案所採取行動。嗱，講埋兩點好快嘅啫。第四咧，就係邊啲行為構成基本法第八十九條。

167
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:15,790
所述法官行為不檢嘅情況，而行政長官可以根據基本法定明嘅相關程序，將改法官免職同埋。

168
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,540
第五，投訴人就針對法官嘅投訴而取得法庭程序錄音記錄嘅權利。

169
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:39,270
係噉啊，黃毓民議員都提咗一係列我哋七月二十三號嘅會議嘅一啲個誒跟進㗎，噉我希望陣間咧我哋都聽下司法機構嘅代表誒都可以跟進下嚇，咁跟住下一位咧就係阿郭榮鏗議員。

170
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:53,520
Thank you, Chairman. I think the one of the major areas of concern, as expressed by the panel in the last occasion, is whether there should be a more detailed set of procedures.

171
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:07,450
在關係到司法投訴，和是否現有的機制有效處理投訴案件，我們注意到第10C段落的報告。

172
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:27,950
That one of the areas of concern, or one of the areas being looked at by the working group, is whether the court leader in question has enough capacity or sufficient resources to deal with all the complaints effectively and diligently. And for example, one could imagine that the

173
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,030
Chief magistrate, for example, being the court leader.

174
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,760
who is responsible for for the large amount of complaints which are

175
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:57,050
The public may have against magistrate decisions, and the sheer number of cases that go through the magistrate system. The court leader in question would probably have to spend most of his time, if not all of his time, dealing with complaints from the public. Now, is the current arrangement?

176
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,740
really。

177
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:19,130
是 enough or sufficient to allow the court leader to to to deal with it on his own. Now, if you look at other jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, they have what is called the Judicial Conduct Investigation Office, which assists the Lord Chief Justice in handling complaints. And although the

178
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:39,140
決定是最終由司法或相關委任法官作出。調查工作通常由本處進行，根據《規例》2013所規定的程序。

179
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:54,840
我 wonder whether in Hong Kong we can follow similar procedures and having those procedures set out in regulations, and to consider the workload which court leaders have to have to bear in dealing with these complaints.

180
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,790
係，誒司法機構嘅代表。

181
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,200
有冇？

182
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:14,830
回應啊！佢哋有時間剩啊，因為四分鐘。哦，而家即刻。因為四分鐘，佢哋有時間剩嘅，畀你可以回應一陣。係啦，因為屬於啊郭議員嘅時間嚟嘅嚇。誒，多謝主席。

183
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:23,550
正如文件所講咧，我哋其實喺舊年嘅十二月咧，誒首席法官咧係成立咗一個內部嘅工作小組。

184
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:31,060
咁呢一個工作小組咧，就除咗首席法官之外咧，仲有其他三位嘅誒法院領導。

185
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:38,090
咁呢一個誒小組主要其實就係希望可以對現時誒針對法官。

186
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:58,730
嗰個行為嘅投訴機制咧，做一個嘅全面嘅檢討啦。因為喺文件入邊都講過，就係話呢個機制其實喺二零零三年誒成立，咁都運作咗一段嘅時間。咁所以咧，誒首席法官都覺得係時候去做呢個檢討。

187
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:18,830
剛才郭議員提到我個問題，就係話究竟現行嗰個機制入邊，特別就係誒由法院領導去處理呢一個啊投訴咧，誒喺資源方面係咪可以有改善嘅空間？咁呢個政綱文件都講咗，就係話誒。

188
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,810
係其中一個檢討嘅一個方向。

189
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:42,100
咁接誒，我使唔使回應埋？仲有唔使一你回應下各議員嘅問題先嚇。噉我或者係誒喺呢度回應到此為止嚇。好噉，或者我哋跟住再跟進。阿郭議員仲有冇跟進咧？係誒，即係你你可唔可以講講就係譬如而家裁判法院嚟講咧，嗰個法院領導去處理所。

190
00:36:42,100 --> 00:37:02,110
所有裁判處有關嘅投訴咧，都係啊首席裁判官要去處理嘅，係咪啊？誒，係嘅。咁呢個就係頭先我所講嘅問題。主席十秒鐘就係你係唔係真係可以期望一個人佢係處理曬所有咁多嘅投訴，而每次處理嘅投

191
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:18,490
投訴都係公允同埋係可以令人信服咯，呢個就係個問題。李生，啊，多謝主席。當然喺現時嘅機制咧，唔係淨係誒首席裁判官去做呢一個工作啦，佢亦都有助手去幫佢做一啲誒工作嘅。嚇，多謝主席。

192
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:39,140
嗱咁咧，就我哋都想誒同各位委員講咧，大家發問嘅問題，亦都可以係我哋今日嚟嘅團體嘅代表嘅。咁下一位咧就係阿蔣麗雲議員。唔該，主席。誒，我都歡迎咧，就係而家司法機構願意去考慮檢討下而家個機制。嗱，大家即係我覺得。

193
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:59,150
唔好話誒，一開始大家即係好似好驚嚇，或者你立法會議員啊，而家點咁關心司法機構咧？咁確實咧，係喺近年來咧，就對於司法機關嘅投訴啊、法院嘅一啲誒一啲誒情況啊，噉係有都。

194
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:19,160
投訴係增加咗㗎嚇，咁所以咧，我哋誒歷經咗咁多年嘅一個制度，係咪時間誒時候需要檢討咧？咁咁即係我認為嚟講咧，當個社會不斷變化中，任何一個機關機構都應該係與呢個社會變法。

195
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,120
嘅變化相適應嘅。

196
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:41,580
咁咧就啊，我啱啱咧亦都聽到，咁咧就係啊，在在有朋友提講過咧，而家咧就係有個啊叫法官嘅啊守則，咁咧我都想知道咧，假如違反咗呢個法官守則嚇，咁咧就啊，而家係咪點處理咧？

197
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:48,000
係咪都係由嗰個首席啊嘅客？你或者可以答一答我，唔該。係。

198
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,790
誒李生或者係阿阿Mr.P.Y.Low嘅，好似係咪啊？講到法官守則嘅嚇。

199
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:15,400
阿李生先啦，好啊。誒，首先我想澄清咧，呢個其實就唔係一個守則，呢個我哋嘅正確嘅名稱就係法官行為嘅指引。咁呢個指引咧，正如頭先都有與會人士提到咧，其實喺二零零四年咧就由呢個司法機構誒發表嘅。咁主要就係。

200
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:30,010
係誒，畀呢個法官同埋司法人員咧，係提供一個日後處事嘅一個實用嘅指引，同埋咧確保佢哋行為上邊咧係嚴守至高嘅一個嘅誒標準嚇。

201
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,060
咁假如違反咗係啦，違反咗噉啊，點樣處理咧？係。

202
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,940
李生。誒。

203
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:57,760
其實違反呢個指引所引致嘅後果咧，我哋想講咧就因為呢個係一個指引啦。咁所以咧，呢個指引咧其實就冇試圖去就住呢一個所謂司法行為失當咧定下一個定義，亦都唔會就違反呢個指引咧就施加任何嘅罰。

204
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:17,770
質嘅嚇，多謝主席。係噉，阿羅生會唔會？我諗就頭先阿李先生講得較為清楚，就係即係啲誒就啊，蔣議員個問題嘅，講得好幾為清楚。噉啊，亦都好多謝啊，李先生澄清噉啊。係即係你冇補充噉啊，蔣議員嚇。咁所以咧就誒。

205
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:37,780
呢一個就係問題所在啦。咁噉，你要知道法官而家佢哋特別喺好多啊嘅啊，即係呢個啊有啲誒呢個，譬如話地區法院啊，或者裁判處啊，好多時候就一個法官去作一個決定。噉啊，而香港咧就係。

206
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:53,170
誒，即係行嘅咧，就係誒，除除咗誒根據基本法嚇之外咧，噉就行一般咧，都係沿用翻呢一個普通法嘅。咁咧，你有好多誒，其實都係誒。

207
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:13,670
即係呢個由嗰個法官去佢認為嚇信與不信，有時並非一定有個十十足證據嚇。有人真係譬如你話有個小偷喺個商店度偷咗件嘢，佢唔需要係度現場即時人裝並獲。

208
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:33,680
而佢只需要係哦，有人話佢偷咗嘢嚇，法官係有權去講信與不信嚇，即係等等之下咧，無可否認誒誒，無論個法官係誒，即係當然啦。我哋可以話啊咁嗱，咁假如佢判咗佢有罪，佢唔服氣，噉佢咪上訴咯噉。

209
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:53,690
就無可否認，我哋香港嗰個上訴咧，就即係嗰個費用啊，各方面都好貴嘅。咁同埋咧，噉啊，法官亦都有權嚇你，慢慢等上訴啦，入咗去坐監先算啦。咁噉，所以你等等咧，即係我覺得係時候，我哋係需要檢討，所以我會支持啊，我哋啊。

210
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:13,700
即係盡快作出嘅檢討。噉，假如我哋檢討嘅結果係認為有必要係，譬如話，我哋而家唔係話立法會議員要去審理法官對與否。我認為喺你哋法院內部應該亦都有個機制嚇，或者有個小組，有個委員會。

211
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:33,710
嚇去衡量呢個法官啊，即係計佢被人投訴之後，噉佢嗰當時佢整個嘅係咪跟足嚇你哋，即係啦，你哋嘅啊法官嘅誒誒，或者行為守則啊，或者係有關嘅程序啊，誒係咪齊曬咧？做足咧？

212
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:53,720
嚇咁咧就誒，我覺得呢個會係好咯，唔使而家咧，真係好多時候市民投訴無門而鬱啲話你去上訴啦。咁噉，我覺得呢一樣嘢咧就係並非市民所想見到嘅啦。好聽到嗱，因為我哋排隊嘅議員咧，我自己睇到個時間咧都仲係可以容許。

213
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:01,890
咁所以咧就畀阿蔣議員去講埋佢嗰個，即係佢嗰個意見。咁跟住咧就係阿梁國雄議員。

214
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,780
多謝主席。其實啊，湯家華議員話。

215
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,870
我同阿黃安文議員嗰個即係嗰封信咧，我哋唔係針對嗰個。

216
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,670
誒法庭嘅判決嘅，即係話唔係，我哋唔係。

217
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:30,390
誒上訴嗰個判決，而係話咧，佢係處理嗰個。當然啦，如果任何嘅司法人員係喺個程序正義嗰度出咗錯誤嘅時候咧，嗰個判決係可以被推翻啦。

218
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,940
事實上，嗰個嗰件嗰嗰單案就推翻咗㗎啦。

219
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,550
咁無端端推翻咗，唔知點解啦。

220
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,700
嗱。

221
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,030
而家嘅問題咧，就係。

222
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,420
好簡單嘅就係，如果如果司法機構係獨立嘅話，如果佢出咗錯，

223
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,990
由邊個去搞咧？噉樣而家咧就係由。

224
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,930
誒最高嗰個法官去搞。

225
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,360
個問題就出咗喺度啦。

226
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,600
如果佢唔能夠去秉承呢樣嘢嘅時候點咧？咁咪根據八十九。

227
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,370
八十九，我哋經話第八十九條去處理。

228
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,090
係啦，咁但係佢都係。

229
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:21,990
要由呢個中審法院首席法官任命喎，而我哋我投訴嗰單而家嗰個人就做咗中審法官嘛，馬道立哥。

230
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,630
咁點搞啊？

231
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:37,990
佢就係牽涉在內喎，我成封信喺佢任內，佢只只指派一個靈案官去同佢去睇啲刑事上訴嘅嘢。

232
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,520
噉我想請教各位律師啊，各位大狀，咁呢個係點樣嘅咧？點樣顯著個程序公義咧？

233
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,780
因為當時啊，馬道立。

234
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:56,790
大法官咧係做緊法庭呢個誒上訴庭嘅，即係誒個個個即係誒最最高嗰位法官。

235
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:04,470
噉佢升咗上去，咁而家我投訴根據第八十九條，你相信馬道立會自己揾個法官嚟查自己嗎？

236
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,940
你相唔相信啦？

237
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,310
如果佢真係咁做，我服。

238
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,080
唔會發生啊嘛！

239
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,760
呢個先先問題啊嘛！

240
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:23,980
係咪啊？嗱，就事論事嘅啫。如果本身我都唔想開名嘅，不過而家你唔開名就就人哋以為我喺度搗亂啦。

241
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,850
係就係噉樣一個回事啊嘛～

242
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,700
而實際上面。

243
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,050
如果揾我哋揾唔到個機制，我我寫信畀阿。

244
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,940
阿阿袁國強，袁國強話：呢啲唔關我事。

245
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:45,600
噉我寫信畀馬道立，其實我係我係我係畀各位大狀危險好多，因為我我有單，我已經上上咗終審庭啦，我就畀判坐監。

246
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:54,800
即係嗰個，即係判坐監，或者同埋有單係同阿曾玉成打官司，打應唔應該佢可以展報。

247
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,250
我take嘅risk幾大啊！我而家搞去指控佢。

248
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,390
有冇當我係玩喺度玩啊？其實唔喺度玩，我就覺得，所以其實。

249
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,550
如果你，

250
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:21,360
係冇辦法去話畀我聽一個理髮師嘅問題，或者解僱啊啊理髮師問題呢個島裏邊一個理髮師幫所有人嘅非法，邊個同佢非法啊？呢個係哥德爾嘅悖論啦，係咪？而家咪個悖論咯。

251
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,140
如果有某一個機構係獨立嘅，而獨立咗之後，

252
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:33,400
佢個首長係擁有曬所有檢查其他人嘅權，咁個首長有事咁點搞？

253
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,780
如果喺，

254
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:43,810
三元輝立底啊！我哋立法會咪制制裁阿梁振英咯。咁而家喺三元輝入裏邊，邊個去制裁？

255
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:48,290
司法司法部嘅，即係如果嗰個首席法官出錯咧？

256
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:58,940
啊！就呢個就噉嘅問題。如果我哋用誒權力及特權條例查佢，更加個憲制危機啦，因為佢一定唔會嚟啦。

257
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,310
係咪？因為我哋唔可以咁做㗎嘛，所以如果我哋冇嗱，其實我哋都公道嘅，主席。

258
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:14,010
我哋喺七月幾嗰陣時咧，就問寫個封信咧，就問其他司法管轄區現時處理針對法官行為的投訴的機制。

259
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:24,890
我哋問嘅，咁而家咧冇冇答到啊！而家都已經係二月廿六號過咗，過咗幾多個月啊？七月即係過咗七個月啦，又港校都過咗七個月。嗱，主席。

260
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:33,360
我去投訴而家嘅終審庭大法官，係等於攞條攞條繩去吊頸嘅。

261
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,230
不過，我為咗公義，我冇辦法唔敢講嘅啫。

262
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,010
我再講一次，我唔係喺度玩嘅。

263
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:44,270
我諗喺呢個喺呢個喺呢個屋間間屋裏喺呢間呢個噉嘅。

264
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,180
會議室裏邊咧，冇人會噉樣玩。

265
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,620
我最少有兩單案。

266
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,330
係會因為我嘅投訴而被重判，所以你哋唔好當我玩。

267
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:03,100
好，誒誒，我哋先讓議員發問完第一輪先，好唔好啊？誒，李慧瓊議員。

268
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,770
誒主席，誒其實我嘅問題都係想問一問咧，就係話其他司法管轄區喺處理法官。

269
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:33,060
啊，嗰個行為投訴方面嗰個做法係如何嘅？因為文件方面我就唔見有好比較詳細交代呢個第一個問題。第二個問題就我頭先都聽團體同埋睇咗文件啦，我誒當然非常明白香港嗰個法治嘅重要性對香港個嗰個誒重要啦。咁但係誒而家講緊嘅就

270
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:48,100
並非嗰個誒判決內容，而係講緊對法官嗰個行為不檢嗰個投訴。咁所以，我覺得誒，雖然基本法有一定規定，但係瞭解多啲唔同司法管轄區嘅做法咧，都有助於我哋去理解成件事。噉我亦都想了解下。

271
00:48:48,380 --> 00:49:01,950
誒嗰個增加透明度方面嘅考慮，你哋過去嗰個考慮係點樣咧？咁噉，我我好似喺文件度我又唔見到你有交代呢方面嘅，唔該。好，誒李生。

272
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,160
誒，多謝主席。

273
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,310
誒。

274
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:15,100
我哋司法機構係知道，委員會喺七月二十三號個會議咧，係有一係列嘅誒資料上嘅要求啦。

275
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:28,850
噉我哋認為咧，就應該喺我哋現時進行嗰個檢討入邊咧，就一評去考慮，同埋咧就全面啲去提供呢一方面嘅資料。

276
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:49,140
譬如話頭先委員提到誒我個誒即係其他司法管轄區喺呢一方面嘅機制咧，噉我哋都需要時間去誒研究啦。咁喺文件入邊我哋都提到咧，就係話我哋要小心一點，就係話當我哋去睇其他司法管轄區我。

277
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:56,890
嗰啲嘅做法嘅時候咧，我哋都要留心，即係未必每一種嘅做法咧，都係適用於香港嘅一個嘅情況。

278
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:07,290
咁另外咧，頭先都有委員提到一啲嘅誒數據啊、資料咧，亦都係因為噉嘅原因咧，我哋都係想即係等呢一個。

279
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,510
檢討完結咗之後咧，我哋就一並去做啦。

280
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:31,800
咁當剛才頭先誒，議員提到話誒，嗰個透明度嗰方面有咩考慮嘅方法？咁因為個檢討其實係十二月先開誒，即係嗰個先開始。噉我哋其實現階段咧都係喺一個誒分析啊、整理。

281
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:47,410
一啲誒基本嘅資料，咁未去到一個話有實際具體嘅一啲嘅措施，誒可以同大家去講嚇。多謝主席，主席，我問一問即係咁嗰個檢討結果會大概幾時向本委員會誒？

282
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,530
有個報告，咁譬如咁其他司法管轄區嘅經驗，我就覺得其實。

283
00:50:52,810 --> 00:51:12,820
誒，我我又真係有啲奇怪，照照計呢一個其他司法管轄區處理法官投訴呢樣照計，唔應該係一啲新事物嚟嘅。時間表啊，林生簡單都講講誒，都係主席誒個檢討咧。其實文件都有講咧，就係話我哋預期喺一年內咧做完。

284
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:32,830
呢個檢討啦，噉我哋希望喺今年年底之前咧，係會有一個報告。李生啊，我諗咧，除咗你議員之外，其實誒呢一個禮拜咧，我哋文件出咗之後咧，我係收到唔少委員咧，就對你哋今日嗰個文件咧係表示不滿，都要我我哋表達出嚟咧，就係七月二十三。

285
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:52,840
報所列出嘅一係列嘅問題，誒包括係嗰個數目、嗰個性質，你哋處理手法，其他管轄區嚇，你嘅你可唔可以咧？唔係等嗰個檢討報告，頭先李議員亦都係追呢一樣嘢，係畀我哋嗰啲委員有更滿意嘅一個答覆咧。咪因為即係呢個好難。

286
00:51:52,840 --> 00:52:06,750
理解啫，我即係其他司法管轄區嘅經驗，照計唔係好難去揾到嘅啫。而我相信在座都係專家，我自己反而唔係呢一個，亦都唔相信係新議題揾處理法官投訴其他司法官，佢嘅經驗。

287
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:27,040
唔需要一年時間嘛？係李生誒，都係主席。我諗我嘅一年唔係話純粹係去抄一啲嘅資料啦。你抄完資料，亦都去嘗試去分析究竟有關嘅制度係點啦。然後跟住我哋要提出一啲嘅建議，有咩改善嘅措施嚇？多謝主席。係誒。

288
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,770
誒咁咧，跟住就係阿謝偉俊議員。

289
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:45,360
主持誒，我睇翻文件咧，第十六段咧，就如果係冇記錄錯誤嘅話咧，就係話應委員會嘅要求咧，司法機構政務處係同意於會後提供下列資料。

290
00:52:45,640 --> 00:53:01,160
噉啊，等咗而家七月廿三號到而家咧，大半年時間度咧，得出嚟嘅結論咧，就係話佢哋而家都要自己再去做，又做一年之後先畀我哋。嗱呢個咧，我希望唔係反映咗司法機關裏邊一種即係至高無上嘅。

291
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:08,020
你哋唔好搞我哋，我哋做咩做？我哋有自己時間，有自己嘅條件，有自己嘅情況去做。呢種傲慢。

292
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:24,420
即係我覺得噉樣做法咧係唔完全唔恰當，因為你哋可以自己去查你哋自己嘅嘢，你自己做檢討。但係我哋既然要求咗呢啲數據，想應承咗嘅話咧，我睇唔到點解你需要等一年，你做完曬檢討之後先提供畀本會。噉啊，希望咧有好有解釋。

293
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:34,050
第二主席，我哋誒，我想理解下咧，就而家誒Cap四三三裏邊咧，關於嗰個誒委員會嘅組成咧。

294
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:54,340
噉我留意到咧，就個民事上咧個行文應該就係話，如果有隻投訴嘅話咧，如果誒首席大法官認為合當嘅，佢有個一個委任一個委員會咧，而係會委任兩位誒呢個原眾庭嘅法官加一位public officer一個公職人員嘅，就唔係有啲我諗就，就算阿錢生都理解錯。

295
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:59,700
咁咧就係佢以為係一個首席誒大法官自己本身加埋兩個另外法官添。

296
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:19,990
噉我想你介以往咧嘅做法咧係點樣？係委任啲乜嘢類型嘅一啲嘅所謂公職人員做呢個第三者咧？咁而家呢一方面咧，如果為咗加強咗嗰個誒公道性，有冇考慮到一啲係譬如話委任一個立法會議員又好，其他一啲嘅同司法機構無關嘅公職人員入去？

297
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:32,110
坐呢個委員會之一，佢未必有一個所謂個誒大多數嘅權力，但係起碼加強咗嗰個嗰個委員會本身嗰個誒問責性或者嗰個公開性咧，咁呢個係咪可以諗嘅咧？

298
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,840
依即第三咧，就誒。

299
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:55,990
我想理解下咧，有我哋而家有冇諗過任何方法，或者希望你哋檢討都考慮埋呢一點咧？就係喺絕大多數情況之下咧，有啲冇代表嘅市民咧，佢哋未必識分邊啲為之係案件嘅判案係理應上訴嘅一啲嘅錯誤，邊一啲係法官本身個人嘅操守。

300
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:16,000
上嘅問題，又或者一啲係處理事案件上嘅不恰當，係同一個判案本身無關嘅。噉我哋有啲咩機制可以提供呢啲噉嘅人士咧，係一個諮詢嘅嘅過程，又或者我哋有冇法律援助幫到呢方面嘅人嚟瞭解下究竟佢係應該嘅途徑係上訴啊，定還是係投訴咧？唔該，住係。

301
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,170
李生，誒多謝主席。

302
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,300
誒。

303
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:40,580
資料方面咧，其實就唔係話我哋誒唔想畀大家，而係確實係喺我哋去開完會之後咧，我哋要諗就係話誒個機制應該點樣去行咧。噉我哋需要一啲時間去諗啦。咁而亦都喺十二月咧就決定。

304
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:54,780
對唔住，李生，我哋而家唔係叫你講結論，我哋攞攞啲原材料，大家一齊做。你有你檢討，我哋有我哋檢討啫嘛。咁呢方面點解你哋要hold住啲原材料？係你哋先有嘅獨家原材料，你哋唔畀我哋，我哋冇嘅。咁呢方面你哋可唔可以配合咧？係，李生。

305
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:15,070
誒，都係主席，我哋就冇獨家嘅原材料。誒，我哋如果要去做呢一個檢討，去睇海外嘅經驗咧，其實我哋都係誒，不外乎係同相關嘅機構咧係聯絡啦。咁第一步可以就係喺互聯網去揾一啲嘅資料啦。對唔住，李生，你唔好誤。

306
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:35,080
路本會，我哋唔係淨係講海外嘅司法點樣處理嘅投訴。嗰度十六段包括有C，in particular，包括C咧就係關於過往三年轉介畀有關投訴個案數字，同埋你哋嘅檢舉行動。嗱，呢啲係你獨家嘅嘢嚟嘅嚇。多多謝主席。誒，頭先因為講開就係海外嗰個嘅做法啦。咁當然。

307
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:53,520
係嗰委員上一次提嘅，就係話一啲嘅誒投訴數字嘅分析，噉我哋真係要要即係逐個個案去睇，然後作一個較為深入啲嘅一個分析，所以呢個係需要一啲時間。李生啊，我諗阿謝議員咧，佢唔係講結論。

308
00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:13,810
誒，我哋委員會討論咧，有時我哋都明白咧結論可能大家都仲要討論更加耐，但係咧一啲數字上嘅參考數據咧，其實你畀到我哋委員會咧，可能總好過咧。我哋做一個決定就由立法會秘書處去做一個啊，做有一個比較嘅報告翻嚟。

309
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:34,060
如果大家委員係唔滿意嘅咧，又自己就進行討論，所以可能你主動提供咧係一個最恰當，即係誒我都聽到委員講咧，就唔係而家要你哋做一個結論，而家應該點樣做，而係大家可能都需要一啲咧係參考嘅資料。嗱，噉我哋誒或者再畀仲有人係拍。

310
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:52,950
係緊第一輪，我哋跟住，我哋仲可以有第二輪可以誒跟進。阿廖長江議員，多謝主席。誒，我係同意湯家華議員所講嘅。如果法官係喺判案嘅時候係犯錯嘅話咧，法庭係已經有一個自我糾正嘅機制，有一個上訴機制嘅。

311
00:57:53,230 --> 00:58:08,100
但係我亦都睇到係誒，亦都係有啲情況咧，可能涉及誒法官嘅誒私人行為，無論喺庭內庭外都係。咁譬如話誒，從涉及啲虛報啊，或者係，

312
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:15,870
同啲不正當啲人物交往啊，或者喺啲不適當嘅場誒場所度出入啊，咁之類嗰啲噉嘅嘢。

313
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:30,910
咁即係如果喺噉嘅情況之下，即係法官受到即係一個啲噉嘅私人嘅操守啊，受到一啲紀律處分咧，我唔覺得係對一個法治嘅侵蝕，我反而係覺得係一個鞏固法治嘅舉措。

314
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:51,360
咁當然係誒，法官誒亦都即係司法嘅機關咧，亦都係提供咗嗰個《基本法》第八十九條啦。但係嗰個係涉及我睇翻，佢係涉及一個免職嘅情況。咁其實有好多情況咧，涉及私私人操守方面，唔需要係一定要去到免職咁嚴重嘅情。

315
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:57,690
程度嘅，噉我相信都要需要一個噉嘅機制喺，即係喺譴責同埋。

316
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:13,290
即係終審法院大法官嘅譴責同埋呢個免職之間，行政長官免職之間咧，可能會有一個係有個係有個range嘅嘅一個誒紀律處分嘅一個一一個一個機制嚟睇誒。

317
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:22,940
使到嗰個誒司法機構咧，可以有個係誒司法官私人操守方面一個自我完善嘅制度，我係歡迎。

318
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:24,340
啊！

319
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:38,090
誒司法機構對誒呢個誒即係法官嘅紀律問題咧作出一個檢討嘅，噉我亦都相信咧，就係我哋都可以講緊係一年嘅時間，我哋可以等到。

320
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:58,380
一年一年之後咧，等佢個報告出咗之後咧，我先重新檢視呢個問題。但係無論將來呢個檢討嗰個結論係點樣樣咧，我都希望咧係嗰個法官嗰個誒操守嗰個機制咧，會有一個透明度，同埋將來關於投訴嗰度法官嗰度嘅決定。

321
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:04,390
咧係有一個公開同埋有理據嘅，亦有理據支持嘅決定嚇。

322
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,260
需唔需要李生回應？

323
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,290
佢可以回應，可以唔回應。好，李生。

324
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:31,580
好誒噉樣咧，就我哋而家咧仲有三位議員咧，就排緊第二輪。噉我自己咧都會喺第一輪呢度補充少少咧，噉就誒讓第二輪嘅議員咧係可以誒發問。係咁咧就誒補充嘅咧就係頭先其實幾位議員都列過我哋七月二十。

325
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:51,590
三號咧一係列嘅一個誒要求啦。咁其實我哋自己睇落去咧，裡面大部分咧都應該係你哋可以喺呢段時間提供到嘅資料嚟㗎。特別係過去三年咧嗰個誒投訴嘅，即係投訴法官嗰個嘅數字誒同埋處理嘅手。

326
01:00:51,590 --> 01:01:11,600
法有邊啲係因為佢哋嘅行為嘅，而唔係話嗰個判決嘅內容係不滿嘅。其實大家係好希望咧，係知道咧，其實現時嚟講係點樣處理咗。咁第二咧就係嗰個透明度嘅問題，其實都希望聽聽你哋嘅睇法。其實去到點樣係一？

327
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:31,610
一個係可以改，既可以改善，亦都係咧去到誒，你哋係覺得係唔會嚇影響咗司法佢自己嗰個運作嗱。其他司法管轄區咧，我哋其實好好多個議題咧都會係嘅，譬如法律援助，我哋都會要求誒，會唔會有其他嘅誒？其他

328
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:51,620
其他嘅地區同埋國家嗰個實踐噉，我覺得呢個咧，你哋真係唔可以話就咁喺互聯網上邊誒，或者叫翻嗰啲委員自己做嘅。你真係應該咧要提供畀我哋，亦都咧未必需要等啊一年嘅時間嘅。噉我覺得呢個咧，我哋係要知知你嘅態度啊，同埋嗰個時間表，你幾時可以畀到我哋？

329
01:01:51,620 --> 01:02:11,630
誒可能去到我哋究竟會幾時會再討論呢個問題咧，係一啲參考嘅作用就唔可能咧係誒迴避就噉話一年之後即係簡單。咁另外咧就係誒有一啲嘅問題咧，就係我都想即係代一啲我哋都收到咧，無論市民啦或者誒律師咧，因為律師咧就唔想公。

330
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:31,640
去問呢啲問題，希望我哋委員會都可以幫佢提出。譬如有時咧，佢哋打官司嘅時候咧，遇到一啲法官，佢可能咧係覺得同嗰個案件咧係有一啲利益衝突嘅，咁但係佢又未必敢提嘅。咁有啲市民自己都有噉，最近都仲收到一封噉嘅信。

331
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:51,650
噉我哋同法律顧問都傾咗咧，即係嗰封信我哋就冇發畀大家。咁喺呢啲，譬如可能當事人或者律師自己想誒提出更換法官去審某件案嘅時候，會唔會有一個更加令到佢哋容易提出，而唔係覺得佢提出咗佢就驚得罪咗個法官，於是乎佢又冇提出咁？

332
01:02:51,650 --> 01:03:07,380
可能佢到最後咧，又心心不憤，又覺得因為冇提出，引以致到咧又可能影響個判決。咁呢一方面會唔會都可以誒提供下一啲你哋嘅一啲嘅睇法？噉我畀啲時間你回應頭先嘅問題嘅。誒，都係主席。

333
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:27,790
首先咧，誒，我想澄清咧，誒，我哋無意話要求委員咧自己去喺互聯網揾有關嘅資料。我只不過話，誒，我哋而家其實着手去睇緊即係其他司法管轄區嗰個安排啦。咁第一步就係喺互聯網去揾一啲資料啦。第二步亦都係要同相關嘅司法管

334
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:47,800
區當局去作一啲嘅澄清，咁做咗呢一個步驟之後咧，我哋係需要整理，然後先可以誒，即係提交有關嘅資料。咁而我哋原先個諗法咧，因為我哋呢一個檢討係一個一年嘅檢討啦，噉我哋希望能夠全面啲，即係。

335
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:57,020
當我哋提供呢啲嘅資料嘅時候咧，我哋係可以一並將其他嘅誒建議咧都可以誒，即係公佈。

336
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:13,530
咁第二點咧就係提到我個誒透明度，即係主席問，即係有咩誒諗法？咁剛才答阿李慧玲議員嘅時候咧，我都講咗，即係我哋其實個檢討只係喺十二月開始啦，噉。

337
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:21,300
啊，李慧瓊，所以誒誒喺十月開始啦，咁所以咧喺誒。

338
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:41,640
都需要一啲時間，我哋要去誒，即係諗究竟喺呢一方面，我哋可以做得幾多，可以增加個透明度。咁至於第三點咧，我或者簡單介紹啦，就係話，如果假如喺法庭入邊，係如果你對法官可能係誒有一啲，即係話佢有利益。

339
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:55,290
衝突咧，咁其實誒，剛才我哋提到嗰個法官行為指引嘅D部咧，其實有啲嘅程序咧係講點樣去取消法官聆訊資格嘅事宜嘅。咁所以其實如果誒，

340
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:15,580
喺嗰個法庭入邊，如果誒某一方係有呢個嘅關注嘅時候咧，其實係應該係向法官提出相關嘅要求或者意見。多謝主席。係誒，我諗跟住我哋先畀第二輪嘅議員發言，咁分別咧有四位嘅，就係郭榮興議員、蔣麗雲議員、謝。

341
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:35,590
韋俊議員同埋梁國雄議員，噉我每一位係畀你誒三分鐘啦，嚇。係多謝主席。主席其實嗰份文件咧，即係誒四版紙噉，只係講一啲好籠統嘅一啲原則性嘅嘅嘅嘢咧。其確實畀人嘅感覺咧係啊。

342
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:55,970
嗰個你話檢討嗰個積極性咧，確實係唔高嘅，因為我哋上一次委員會講已經係七月，我哋提出好多問題，包括我自己提出嘅一啲數據嘅，你完全冇答到，咁都算啦。咁但係你話啊，你要去再去啊研究下其他司法管轄區究竟嘅做法係點樣咧？其實呢啲咧五分。

343
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:15,980
中之內已經可以做到，即係譬如好似誒澳洲噉樣，佢嗰個法律改革委員會喺二零一二年嘅時候咧，出咗一份一百頁嘅報告，就係分析曬英國、蘇格蘭、紐西蘭、美國、加拿大同埋澳洲嗰六個司法管轄區，佢哋各自係點樣去處理。

344
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:35,990
司法機關嘅投訴嘅，咁呢個報告已經喺度啦，即係佢哋已經係分析曬，除非你唔信佢，覺得佢錯嘅啫，佢已經分析曬。咁其實呢啲資料全部都有曬喺度，噉係咪真係話要等一年時間咁？你慢慢去去整咧，即係畀人嘅感覺咧，係對呢件事誒嗰個處理嘅積極性咧，係唔係？

345
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:41,960
咁高呢個係我嘅意見，所以我希望咧，即係啊啊，司法機關係可以。

346
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:56,680
積極啲去考慮，尤其是嗰個透明度啊，同埋嗰個誒公信力嘅問題。因為如果你縱觀全世界嘅誒普通法司法管轄區咧，確實香港喺處理法官投訴嘅程序。

347
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:16,970
佢嗰個條文咧，係比其他司法管轄區咧嗰個公開性同埋嗰個透明度咧係為低嘅。呢個係你睇翻其他司法管轄區，你都睇到香港確實係比較落後，所以其實係好有一個進步嘅空間。噉啊，主席最後啊，我想講講就係頭先民。

348
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:25,270
見都有提到，就係行政、立法同埋司法機關嗰三個啊啊主幹，佢哋之間嘅關係啦。其實，

349
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:45,690
啊！行政機關要尊重法官咧，呢個亦都係一個好重要嘅元素。而我最近聽到咧，就係啊，一貫以嚟咧，法官去到行政長官面前咧宣誓就任咧，係要成套嘅法庭嘅裝束，包括係袍啦、假髮啦，全部都要係著。

350
01:07:45,690 --> 01:08:05,700
上跟住去到參加呢個儀式，而但係最近咧，我聽到話行政長官要求法官唔需要再行呢一套禮儀，唔需要再去戴假髮、著長袍去到面前宣誓。嗱，我唔知道呢個係咪有呢噉嘅事。我希望司法機關可以澄清，究竟係咪行政機關曾經暗示或者明示？

351
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:25,710
叫法官咧，係唔需要再行呢套禮儀。而呢套禮儀咧，係回歸前後咧都係一直係係誒用嘅。點解會有呢個改變咧？我希望你我我知道李先生今日答唔到我。我希望司法機關咧喺用後咧係可以向我呢個委員會作出一個書面嘅回覆。O.K.李生答唔答到？誒，我諗要書面。

352
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,410
先可以答到頭先嘅問題。跟住係蔣麗雲議員，唔該啊，主席。

353
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:49,700
即係我諗諗下咧，就都係唔掂，因為咧，我哋誒覺得嗱，你哋作為司法機關嘅話咧，即係你哋講嘢咧就好有口齒㗎，你哋應該係好守法㗎，係咪？咁但係上一次咧，即係我哋嗯，即係誒同你又同意咗會提。

354
01:08:49,700 --> 01:09:09,710
提供咗誒誒一啲文件畀我哋㗎嘛，係咪總共有五樣嘢㗎嘛？咁但係你今日咧就翻嚟就都係冇提供到畀我哋，咁即是你已經係打破你個承諾啦，係咪？所以我希望咧，你咧就係繼續有唔足嘅。

355
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:29,720
未提到嘅，能夠係補翻上。雖然你啱啱咧，你就講，你話咧誒，其他司法官係區現時處理針對法官的行為嘅投訴嘅機制，你話要攞咗嚟之後再去分析，唔使你攞咗啲料之後，你畀我哋，我哋識去分析㗎啦，係咪嚇？或者？

356
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:49,730
我哋明白，我哋亦都會請教你係咪？噉啊，另外咧就係啊，阿主席啊，可唔可以咧再加多一樣啦？未齊嗰啲嘢咧，我哋繼續追佢好唔好？咁咧，我哋另外加多一樣，要佢咧就畀嗰個要求，即係佢個叫做行為。

357
01:09:49,780 --> 01:10:04,570
不檢嘅守則係咪啊？係咪叫行為不檢守則啊？係嚇，畀埋我哋啦，好唔好啊？咁無謂我翻去又去互聯網度揾啦。既然你呢份啱啱有朋友講係公開㗎嘛，噉你畀埋我哋得唔得？

358
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:14,200
誒誒，李生，誒多謝主席。誒，我個守則唔係守則啦。誒，我再講一次，係一個叫法官行為指引。

359
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,360
嚇，法官行為指引噉，而呢一個文件咧。

360
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:28,230
誒喺司法機構嘅誒網站都有嘅，不過係如果委員係想要嘅時候咧，我哋都可以誒同秘書處聯絡啦。

361
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:48,520
咁至於上一次會議誒委員要求嘅資料咧，我哋係會再跟進嘅。我哋唔係唔跟進，我哋係會跟進。噉我哋都聽到今日委員嘅意見，我哋會誒將呢啲意見咧誒向誒首席法官誒即係提出。得唔該啊，啊主席啊，係嗱我都。

362
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:55,360
誒明白㗎啦，咁多謝你跟進嚇。咁咧就除咗要加咗呢個指引之外咧，我仲要多一樣嘢。

363
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:15,650
就係咧，你要畀你話你哋而家要成已經成立咗個內部工作小組嘛嚇，檢討緊有關機制嘛。我係歡迎嘅，但係我要你畀個時日時間表我。你究竟檢討到幾時？你個進度如何？而家係立法會事務委員會嘅邀。

364
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:16,460
求。

365
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,470
係，李生。

366
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:38,760
誒都係主席誒個時間表，其實我哋喺個文件講咗，就係話用一年嘅時間去做個檢討。喺二零一四年年底咧，我哋希望可以誒完成曬成個檢討。都係主席係誒跟住係啊，謝偉俊議員。主席，我都誒只係重申一次咧，就。

367
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:58,770
我希望誒當局咧，特別李生嘅閣下咧，可以翻去表達下咧。我哋對於而家呢個第十六段裏邊個A、B、C、D、E個五項咧，其實邊啲係你哋已經現成有嘅，而恐怕係你哋部門先至係即係獨家有嘅。我希望盡快攞到，因為呢個咧，我唔希望話要等到你哋十二個月之後咧有結論先至翻嚟，我哋先做到事。

368
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:18,780
我哋冇咗嗰個時間性喺度，因為基本上我哋只要係啲原材料，等大家一齊，你有你做，我有我哋做咁解啫。但係餘下時間咧，我想畀充足嘅時間畀李生答翻我。剛才有兩個問題咧未答到，一個就係關於誒公職人員喺嗰個誒喺個參與成分過往你哋嘅記錄裏邊咧，究竟係用邊類嘅公職人員？

369
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:38,790
做呢個所謂審台處嘅其中一位咧，有冇試過係有啲即係其他比較啊營售性高嘅啊非司法人員嘅人員喺裏邊咧？誒，另外一個就係關於有關，如果係有啲冇律師代表嘅當事人，佢哋有冇咩幫助佢哋協助佢哋分辨B D係應該循正職上訴程序處理嘅投訴B。

370
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:58,800
邊啲係應該係有關法官嘅表現，而係可以另外一個係作去誒，甚至大法官嘅投訴嘅嗰種嘅機制？係李生誒，多謝主席。第一個問題咧，我手上冇有關嘅資料，係需要去誒查一查先可以回應翻啊，議員嘅問題。咁至於第二個就係冇法律。

371
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:18,810
代表嘅人士咧，咁誒，我哋冇一個特別嘅機制，話點樣幫佢分辨，即係究竟呢一個投訴係屬於一個上訴嘅性質，或是即係一個所以司法決定嘅性質，或者呢個係屬於一個誒司司法行誒法官行為嘅一個一個噉樣嘅幫助。

372
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:38,820
咁當然啦，喺誒誒呢一個民政事務局曾經亦都成立咗一個一個中心，但係我個就主要係幫助一啲誒無法律代表佢哋對於一啲法律程序嘅一啲嘅諮詢。咁呢個就有噉樣嘅一個服務嚇。多謝主席。有冇啲類似好似？

373
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:58,830
我哋而家嚇誒進步嘅機構，例如話誒警務處、啊警署裏邊咧，更加ICC咧，都有一啲嘅書面嘅誒解釋同埋一啲嘅誒協助，畀當事人咧就有關佢哋權利咧作出一個誒初步嘅介紹，甚至乎咧係話如果有啲乜嘢係覺得唔覺得係誒不。

374
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:16,150
食嘅係需要上訴嘅時候，可以有啲乜嘢上訴嘅途徑，或者咩投訴嘅途徑咧？咁呢一方面咧，譬如喺司法部有冇辦法可以把上盡快執嚟執行呢一方面嘅補救工作咧？李生，誒都係主席，誒係如果就住誒呢一個投訴法官行為。

375
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:36,680
嘅機制咧，其實喺二零零三年我哋誒推出即係啲成立呢個機制嘅時候咧，係有一個單張係出過畀公眾人士嘅。咁呢個單張亦都係不斷更新啦。噉係如果任何人士，如果佢真係想要呢個單張嘅時候，亦都可以去司法機構去攞啦。如果好似我哋啲旅客咁咧。

376
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:56,690
入境嗰陣時，派張單張畀佢介紹下佢哋嘅權利咧。呢個譬如所有啲當事人係冇律師代表都可以畀張單張佢咧。係李生，我我諗係如果佢需要一啲嘅協助嘅時候咧，其實去我哋嘅誒冇律師代表嘅一個資源中心啦，我相信佢亦都可以攞到呢啲嘅單張嚇。多謝主席。好，跟住咧係啊。

377
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,270
啊，梁國雄議員。

378
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:01,460
主席，其實嗰個問題咧，就誒。

379
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,400
冇解決到嘅，因為。

380
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:08,550
即係誒司法當局，即係畀我哋文院第八段咧，就。

381
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,400
即係講咗啊！

382
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,490
呢一個終審庭大法官個。

383
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,170
首席法官個意見啊，佢就話。

384
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,590
誒，如果，

385
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,190
啊！

386
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,890
即係有事嘅時候咧，噉就會。

387
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:35,900
誒可以用第八十九條去處理。咁第八十九條係已經確立咗個法官本身有問題，首席法官咧就根據第八十九條委任一個機構，即係睇下佢使唔使免職。

388
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,790
而家我哋講緊嘅就係未必係免職㗎嘛。

389
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:46,220
即係等於我而家投訴話，你如果個法官一個上訴庭嘅。

390
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,370
首席法官叫一個臨案官去睇刑事上訴，佢未必要免職㗎嘛。

391
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:52,510
係咪？

392
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,210
咁點辦？

393
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:57,180
咁唔查，所以我哋話有個機制咯。

394
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:08,620
即係話，你一啲嘅行為不檢也好，你獨職也好，或者係誒程序不正義也好，有唔同嘅層次㗎嘛，所以所以呢個。

395
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,020
誒呢個司法部嘅第。

396
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:17,240
嗰個文件第八段咧，呢個終審法院嘅首席法官今日答非所問。

397
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,840
佢唔敢講，就係話香港唔應唔應該有噉嘅機制。

398
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,180
去做呢樣嘢。

399
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:30,570
到底應唔應該有一個包含咗唔係法官在內嘅機制去處理呢啲噉嘅投訴？

400
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,050
呢個第一個。

401
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,960
咁第二個咧，就係。

402
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,150
我都係講翻嗰句。

403
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,720
其實我哋問你嘅又非常之周詳嘅，嗱，譬如。

404
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:58,670
A嗰點，在接受裁判官司法任命前未曾出任執業律師的裁判官人數，呢個係一定係令到司法公正有即係得唔得到實現係有關，因為佢一個人連執業律師未做過點嘅審案啊，哥。

405
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,890
你要講出嚟個程度有幾深啊嘛？

406
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,310
係咪啊？

407
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,680
仲有。

408
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:17,480
呢個B B點都係㗎，B點我度已經講咗啦，係咪？C點你又冇講啦，C點我度就係講話你法官到底畀人投訴係關於乜嘢啊嘛？

409
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:25,290
係咪兩樣都重？又係行為不檢，又係呢一個涉及呢個判案錯誤，你又唔畀？

410
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,220
咁點搞咧？

411
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,810
即係你，你唔畀我哋，即係其實你明唔明啊？即係等於個決鬥噉樣。

412
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,440
一人派支槍，你唔畀子彈我，咁點打啊？我我係揸支槍，你又揸支槍。

413
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:44,610
因為即係你要睇個決鬥片啦，每人行十步，轉身，你嗰啲槍又有子彈，我哋冇子彈，咪打死我哋咯。

414
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,440
即係你根本，我哋監察唔到你。

415
01:17:48,030 --> 01:18:08,040
呢個係非常惡劣嘅行為嚟㗎。老實講，如果如果係你哋去審人哋啊，嗰單官司已經輸咗啦。你試下，你唔唔畀個submission上去啊？你唔畀你你submission做得差啲啊？Affirmation冇啊？睇下你有冇機會攞到leave啊？嘥時間啦！我哋我畀你拒絕兩次。

416
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,660
司法複核啊，上揚蔓延啊，你都話佢唔睇啊！

417
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,410
如果畀我審你哋，瓜柴啦你！

418
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:24,000
你冇機會攞到呢份，即係你冇機會嚟呢度作工啊！冇機會嚟呢度同我哋講嘢，知唔知啊？你噉嘅態度。

419
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,120
唔畀入呢度啊！

420
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:35,480
係誒噉啊，梁國雄議員咧嗰個意見都好清楚。嗱，跟住咧就仲有一位議員係第三輪咁知。

421
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:56,040
啊！李慧瓊議員都想係第二輪嘅，噉我哋畀阿李慧瓊議員問埋第二輪咧。誒係四分鐘啊，三分鐘，O K嚇。李慧瓊議員好誒，主席，我有個要求嘅，因為誒有鑑於誒委員都對於誒當局未能夠提供資料咧，係。

422
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:12,930
有意見嘅噉，我希望咧呢個議題咧係可以擺落去繼續嘅待議事項啦。當有合適嘅時間咧，誒，當我哋睇到資料咧，我認為係可以再討論嘅。呢個第一點。第二咧就係關於嗰個第八文議嘅第八點咧，終審法。

423
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:33,230
院首席法官認為，需予強調嘅係檢討過程必須以下述各項原則作為前提，其中私嗰個原則咧，我就未被説服嘅。我都誒再睇基本法第八十九條。咁正如頭先有啲同事都講過，因為嗰個適用範圍咧，從字面理解咧，就係話。

424
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:42,230
係當法官，只有在無力履行職責或行為不檢嘅情況下咧，行政長官咧就係誒委任。

425
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:51,010
啊，不少於三名當地嘅法官組成嘅審議庭去處理呢件事。咁但係，如果講話投訴法官嗰個行為，

426
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:57,440
即係噉，就因為咁而演譯成為只有處理呢個法官行為不檢嗰個。

427
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:17,730
誒處理必須由法官組成咧，我就從從即係字面上，我真係不不被説服。我想講講呢個係咪你哋嗰個必要遵守嘅原則嘅咧？定係其實誒，如果好似誒立法會或者甚至坊間都有質疑呢個講法，係咪一定係要咁？

428
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,390
樣你哋喺個檢討過程裏邊會點樣處理呢一點咧？

429
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,020
係，李生。誒，多謝主席。

430
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:42,940
文件嘅第八段咧，其實你睇翻就係話喺展開檢討工作嘅時候咧，係必須確保檢討嘅方向係符合呢個基本法所託立嘅一個框架。咁特別，我哋係提到即係基本法第八十九條啦。

431
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:52,900
咁呢一個咧係我哋現時嚟講喺推進呢一個檢討嘅時候咧，三個誒重要嘅原則之一啦。噉我哋亦都會。

432
01:20:53,180 --> 01:21:13,190
誒跟呢個原則去進行呢一個檢討嚇。噉我想問咧，即係我當然咧，我唔係法律界，我唔知我有冇理解錯，因為誒應該正如頭先廖長江議員都講，中有個中間嘅安排㗎嘛，係嘛？即係若然係投訴，因為而家其他專業嘅團體當被人投訴，佢本身。

433
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:33,200
真嘅行為嘅時候，我嘅理解係我我幾乎都舉唔到邊一個專業團體係冇一啲獨立人士作為作為一個獨立意見咁去達至個結果嘅。咁當然可以大家提供資料啦。咁即係若然因為八十九條係即係定立咗呢個原則，即係話第時誒。

434
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:51,300
處理呢啲投訴行為嘅時候，必定係由法官去處理，而唔容許獨立嘅意見嘅時候，我就覺得係咪同而家其他專業團體嘅處理方法都有好唔同咧？咁呢個八十九條係咪一定係演繹成為咁咧？我我想了解下。係咪係咯？誒，阿李生。

435
01:21:51,780 --> 01:22:00,740
誒，都係主席。當然，我哋睇第八段詩嘅時候咧，我哋唔可以就咁抽離八詩去睇啦，我哋都要睇埋八比。

436
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:21,030
八B亦都係一個誒，即係首席法官係好覺得係好重要嘅原則咯。就係話政府嘅行政、立法、司法機構喺處理其各自內部嘅事務嘅時候咧，各機關喺角色同埋職能上嘅分立咧，係必須予以充分嘅考慮。咁呢呢個即係我我諗大家去。

437
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:41,040
去睇呢個問題嘅時候咧，係要整體，即係呢三個原則去去去去理解。多謝主席。係李生，我諗你聽到議員嘅意思咧，我哋睇翻八廿九條咧，佢嗰度嘅寫法咧就係誒，即係行政長官可根據嚇誒首席法官任命，不少於咁可能。

438
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:49,900
咧呢度咧，大家都仲可以咧有個空間去討論下嗰個不少於係咪淨係侷限喺誒法官？

439
01:22:50,450 --> 01:23:10,460
噉你哋咧就呢個就係議員嘅問題嚟嘅。其實噉你可以翻去咧就繼續探討一下，因為佢嗰個字眼咧就係即係任命不少於三位當地法官，即係你至少有三位咧就係當地嘅法官啦。如果係中審法院大法官咧，就不少於五位當地法官啦。誒呢個問題亦都係有啲人提過。

440
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:30,470
如果你係全部法官去調查，翻法官會唔會有一啲其他中立嘅人喺度咧？咁呢個係議員嘅問題，好唔好啊？誒，跟住我哋畀第三輪嘅第三輪咧，就係有兩位，一位咧就係阿張麗雲議員同埋阿郭榮亨議員。噉我哋就會係誒，即係結束議員。

441
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:50,480
發問嘅時間，噉啊，最後總結嘅時候，我都會邀請翻今日與會者，如果大家係有意見補充咧，都可以畀我哋委員會參考嘅。咁梁國雄議員，好短又講，好噉就誒三位都係一分鐘啦，好唔好啊？係，蔣麗雲議員，快啲啦，我盡量畀你講完。

442
01:23:50,480 --> 01:24:08,470
你嘅意見啦，阿主席啊。上一次咧，我哋呢個委員會咧就有啲啊啊議員啦，就建議咧要成立一個獨立嘅調查機機構嚇。咁咧就誒就首誒呢個誒呢邊啊啊啊首席法官咧就。

443
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:28,760
覆咗翻嚟咧，即刻反對嚇，噉啊認為會影響到佢哋嘅獨立，即係我想噉樣啊，主席，我哋真係pass個message畀佢啦，唔係即係帶個信息話畀佢聽啦，唔緊要㗎，OK，一個法庭咧唔係你淨係要獨立，你一定要係咧係公開透明嚇，咁咧你先至得到人哋尊。

444
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:48,770
重㗎嘛，最緊要係人哋要尊重你我哋嘅司法制度，所以呢一樣嘢真係要話聲畀佢聽。另外咧，啊主席啊，你順便咧就同司法機關嗰邊講講，好唔好咧？嗱，我都睇到啊李先生咧，都儘量想答我哋嘅問題。不過咧，但我睇清楚咧，原來佢係副政務長啊嚇，我唔知有幾多個副政務長啊。

445
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:54,840
可能咧有有五六個六七個唔知啦嚇，噉我唔會下次叫個政務長過嚟，邊個係政務長啊？

446
01:24:55,250 --> 01:25:15,260
嗯哼，阿劉女士係嚇噉，不如下次叫政務可以可以可以揸得主意㗎啦，係咪嚇？唔係嘅話，嗱嗱預算你又嚟攞錢啊，啱嘛？攞錢攞咁快啦，你班法官加人工係叫加得咁快啦，啱嘛？仲多過人哋嘅啱唔啱？嚇！而家見你問攞幾個資料喎，都攞唔到嗱，我都好同情。

447
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:35,270
你但係咧，你睇到我哋啲資料啦。我相信在座法律界嘅人士，即係都唔會認為我哋有啲乜嘢過分啦。問佢攞幾個資料係嘛？投訴咩個案啊？等等嗰啲嘢，好好閒啫嘛。咁都唔畀到咩？係咪？所以咧，我相信啊，今日李生真係有難處。下一次咧，就揾阿政務長過嚟。唔該，好跟住就係。

448
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,240
啊！

449
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:58,620
誒郭榮亨議員啦嚇，主席啊，誒我就咁好簡單一個問題，我想大陸僱傭會嘅代表幫幫手，因為頭先李慧瓊議員咧就講到話誒基本法係咪話一定只係容許法官去睇法官有冇違規或者有冇有冇誒需要即係誒誒處理嘅個案噉樣咧，但係頭。

450
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:15,160
先，我應該聽到法大律師公會嘅意見咧，就係認為喺香港而家嘅情況咧，係唔需要有法官以外嘅人去介入呢個投訴機制。呢個好似我係聽到你哋嘅意見，我想希望你喺依一點嗰度咧，啱啱回應嘅時候可以解釋一下。好。

451
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,600
有半分鐘，阿石。

452
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,300
誒石主席會唔會想回應下？

453
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:34,680
如果你睇翻第八十九條咧，八十九條就話至低限度就要有幾多位幾多位法官啊？噉啊，其實羅佩源先生佢寫一本書關於基本法，佢而家攞住。

454
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:42,790
阿羅佩賢先生佢其實寫一本有關基本法嘅書，佢而家攞住，咁其實佢裏邊都有指出咧，就係誒其實。

455
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:52,250
唔緊要，畀你講埋佢啊，係啊，我哋都佢裏邊指出咗就係其實八十九條係冇講過話，除咗嗰三位或者五位最低限度嘅法官之外。

456
01:26:52,550 --> 01:27:10,460
有冇可能係揾一啲譬如話退休嘅法官，亦都冇講過話可唔可以揾一啲唔係誒法官嘅人咧？咁所以呢一度咧，你可以話誒喺嗰本著作度係留白咗。咁呢度其實即係如果你要拗兩邊都可以拗，咁但係我只不過係提出就係話其中一個即係可爭議嘅論點，就係咧。

457
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:30,750
如果你寫話最低限度要有誒三位法官，但係原來係留翻係可以與此同時可以有好多唔係本地法官，或者甚至乎係即係社會人士嘅話咧，會唔會係同個原意未符合咧？咁呢個係一個即係爭拗嘅點嚟嘅。咁當然所有嘢喺一個法治社會，就到頭來可能係。

458
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:50,830
即係都係要由即係法庭去定奪啦。咁但係即係呢一點，其實我相信亦都係可能係即係第八段第C裏邊即係其中一個所謂即係草擬者佢心裏邊所想嘅其中一個論點，會係呢樣。咁當然即係冇人可以話蓋棺論定，究竟definitely嚇佢裏邊係話一定只能夠係法。

459
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:51,780
觀定係唔係？

460
01:27:52,420 --> 01:28:10,220
而即係著作，亦都係即係我哋叫做left open留白咗嘅呢一點係，即係有個合理嘅論點啦，係嘛？有一個合理論，即係呢，即係我我嘅理解就係即係而我亦都覺得係一個合理嘅論點，就係話即係如果你寫到話最低限度要三個或者五個，話原來與從上可以有二百個係即係街外人嘅噉。

461
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:30,530
咁點解要寫最低二百？我哋我哋咁啦，我哋就主要係討論咁有冇個空間可以研究啦。噉就我哋都未必需要講到嗰個人數啊。頭先議員問嘅噉，我諗誒誒李生亦都聽得到大家嘅意見，咁可以細心再研究一下，即係有嗰個空間去嘅時候。

462
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:37,940
咁咧誒，我哋仲有梁國雄議員係第三輪嘅嚇，梁國雄議員。唔係我，我覺得誒。

463
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:43,320
終審庭大法官個首席法官個意見好清楚啦，佢話嗰個。

464
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:47,910
誒審議庭咧必須由法官組成，佢講好清楚嘅。

465
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,350
噉佢啱唔啱咧，就自有公論啦。

466
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,760
即係我對法律嘅解解釋。

467
01:28:54,160 --> 01:29:14,170
第二個咧，我就係講我我數數來都唔認為行政誒機構包括立法機關咧係可以去隨便掂嗰個法庭嘅，或者分唔分離係不可想象。我哋問嘅就係話喺現代咁文明嘅社會，你能唔能夠透明到令到第四權可以？

468
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:15,470
監察你，呢個第一。

469
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:26,560
喺監察嘅過程裏邊，你成個法庭嘅運作係要透明化、公開化。舉個例，攞個我自己上訴，攞錄音帶都畀幾萬嘅，咁點上訴啫？

470
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:46,860
係冇得搞嘅，咁如果直傳咪監察你攞個錄音帶又要攞幾萬點監察啫？嗱，呢個第一個，第二個我講嘅就係話喺必要時嘅時候係唔係行政人唔係行政關干涉你啊？係市民去或者傳媒去去監察你，你不一定要罰出嚟提嗰啲人。

471
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,230
做到你㗎，我就放心啊！

472
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:54,340
否則咧係放心唔到㗎嘛，因為你冇即係嗰個《理法理法師》個古仔係咁講。

473
01:29:54,720 --> 01:30:04,540
即個悖論嚟㗎嘛！冇你冇人監察嘅時候，咁咪即係一定係即係我唔相信法官係特種動物嚟啦，係咪啊？George O’Reilly講嘅嘢對佢哋都適用啊！

474
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,670
絕對權力，絕對腐敗。

475
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:28,330
梁議員嘅意見好清楚啦，透明度嚇。噉我就唔係Jojo嘅啦，噉係一個上議院嘅議員啦。好，誒阿蔣麗雲議員係咪last statement最後一句？係啊，我講兩句啫，阿主席。好，誒，既然咧就今次咧啲資料咧就誒都未攞翻嚟，冇資料畀我哋啦。咁啱啱話有議員咧亦都提出啦，將佢。

476
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:48,340
繼續逐議事項，我唔知逐議事項逐到幾時啊，係嘛噉啊，不如噉啊，阿主席，我建議咧，下次會議咧啊，繼續啊呢個將呢個啊呢呢呢個item攞啊呢呢呢呢個個案攞翻上嚟，呢個議程攞翻上嚟。好，聽到你嘅意見，我哋陣間最後先一並處理。誒，而家咧，我哋係。

477
01:30:48,340 --> 01:31:01,110
係誒畀誒最後嚇誒阿李生啦，同埋與會者仲會唔會有一啲嘅補充？誒喺我哋今日嘅討論噉，睇下大家會唔會有補充？幾位教授誒同埋代表。

478
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,370
係，Professor Game， please。

479
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:22,100
Just, chair, one or two very brief observations. I think the first problem is is is an overemphasis on the role and the place of Article 89. Article 89, in terms, is actually dealing with a situation where you got where you are contemplating removing a judge from office.

480
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:33,870
Now, a great many issues of judicial misconduct or judicial conduct will not involve any question or any possibility of the judge being removed from office, and I think that needs to be borne in mind that there may well be.

481
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:42,330
Areas of complaint about judicial behaviour and judicial conduct, which would not result in their removal from office, which is the focus of Article 89.

482
01:31:42,610 --> 01:32:02,620
I think the point that lay people need some guidance as to what can and cannot be dealt with under these the existing procedures is very well made. It isn't actually a very difficult form of guidance to be offered. It's available on the websites of other systems that handle.

483
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:22,630
關於司法 misconduct，它經常難以説什麼是包括，但不是太難以説明什麼不能在一個系統的關於司法 misconduct 的舉報中處理。我認為，雖然我們必須非常小心地進行比較和從其他司法管轄區吸取教訓。

484
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,530
I think that there is.

485
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:32,990
really quite a lot of information already out there that is is available and can be used fairly quickly to reach some of the.

486
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,250
問題都已經被答覆由成員們這裡今個下午。

487
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:56,970
Thank you。係多謝啊Professor Geng。噉我諗咧就阿李生仲會唔會有最後嘅補充？如果冇補充咧，我哋睇下今日點樣處理咧。而家即係有啲議員嘅意見，同埋咧頭先我哋有啲意見啦。咁有議員咧就希望咧就係繼續你哋要儘快啦，將我哋認為咧，其實你唔需要等一年嘅資料咧。

488
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:16,980
咧應該畀我哋嘅噉。事實上，因為咧差唔多已經係誒半年以上㗎啦距離舊年嘅七月二十三號。咁亦都有委員咧就希望下次咧會再傾嗱。我哋啱啱咧開會嘅時候就講咗下一個會嘅議程嘅噉，但係咧我會擺喺待議事項咧就睇下四月份噉，我哋都比較理。

489
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:36,990
生佢哋咧，誒有一個月嘅時間啦。咁起碼咧喺資料上嘅嘢咧，應該有足夠嘅時間咧，畀資料畀我哋委員覺得需唔需要咧？根據你哋嘅資料，我哋咧係誒再排多一節，係請你哋嘅政務長嚟再誒，即係係解答下一啲問題。

490
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:57,040
如果你嘅提供嘅資料，大家覺得係可以即係誒誒跟進嘅，噉我哋嗰陣時，我哋再討論會唔會撥時間。但係最緊要希望咧，你哋係尊重咗我哋，特別係舊年嘅七月廿三號咧，其實有一係列嘅問題咧，係你哋應該係可以做得到嘅。噉我始終都係講嗰句，希望。

491
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:17,050
唔好咧，就係你哋冇交過嚟，我哋最後咧就係請秘書處做噉，我哋就可能就唔會等你哋嘅時間咧。我哋自己咧喺可能喺呢度作出討論。噉我儘量希望唔係咁噉，所以希望你咧翻到去亦都可以將呢一個意見嚇噉。我哋咧就係三月就唔會即係因為時間表已經排曬。

492
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:37,060
咁最快咧都會係四月，噉我哋都會睇下司法機構咧再提供啲乜嘢資料畀大家嘅。噉我諗咧就誒今日嘅喺呢個議程咧就討論到而家啦。噉係誒我哋多謝曬咁多誒議會嘅代表，咁亦都係誒請下一個議程嘅。

493
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,430
嘅代表咧，就係進入我哋嘅會議室。

494
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,020
嚟齊咗啦！嚇。

495
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:44,650
yeah。

496
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:46,260
好。

497
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:52,080
誒咁咧，就下一個議程咧。

498
01:34:52,360 --> 01:35:01,600
就係其實係有關區域法院審裁平等機會申索嘅法例修訂建議。

499
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,860
咁誒所。

500
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:20,370
畀大家參考嘅文件咧，就係C B括弧四四一五stroke十三-hyphen十四括弧零五，就係政府當局就住有關區域法院審裁平等機會申索嘅法例修訂建議。

501
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:29,280
第二份咧就係C B括弧四四一五足十三-十四括弧零六，就係香港律師會嘅意見。

502
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:49,640
第三份咧就係C B括弧四四一五stroke十三-hyphen十四括弧零七，就係大律師公會嘅意見。咁咧，所有其他嘅立法會議員咧喺呢個項目，我哋亦都係邀請佢哋嚟參與討論㗎。而家我哋首先請司法機。

503
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:53,730
機構嘅代表都係阿李生啦，係對文件作出介紹。

504
01:35:54,010 --> 01:36:01,540
誒，多謝主席。今次呢一個法例修訂建議咧，主要係個目的係簡化區域法院審裁。

505
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:14,350
一啲平等機會伸索嘅一個程序，咁現時嚟講咧，有四條法例咧反歧視嘅法例咧，都係可以提出呢一啲伸索。噉我哋嘅具體建議咧，就係話。

506
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:24,320
畀一啲規定提交需要符合技術細節嘅狀書嘅複雜程序咧，就有一啲較為簡單嘅程序去取代啦。

507
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:38,470
其中咧就係需要符合技術細節嘅狀書咧，其實就可以依照法例修訂之後所定明嘅一啲格式限制較為寬鬆嘅申索同埋回應表格去取代。

508
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:52,900
當然啦，喺個別嘅情況之下，如果有需要嘅時候咧，法庭亦都可以主動或者應當事人嘅申請咧，只是需要沿用嚴格規誒，即係格式限制嘅一啲狀書程序。

509
01:36:53,230 --> 01:37:01,120
咁另外咧，我哋都會就住相關嘅程序咧，一並咧就簡化，誒，令到佢咧更加理想。

510
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:21,900
咁誒喺誒諮詢嘅過程入邊咧，我哋其實都諮詢咗唔同嘅機構啦，即係包括平等機會委員會、大律師公會、誒律師會啦。噉我哋佢哋整體上咧都係支持呢一個嘅法例修訂嘅建議嘅。咁有關嘅修訂咧，其實亦都喺個誒。

511
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:38,920
誒文件入邊咧都標示咗出嚟，噉啊，如果獲得委員嘅支持嘅啦，我哋希望可以喺今年誒夏季之前咧誒，可以將有關嘅建議提交立法會進行誒先定立後審議嘅程序。多謝主席。

512
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,340
係，誒而家請委員發言。

513
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,620
請問有冇委員想發言？

514
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:55,850
係，咁議會嘅代表係誒大律師公會嘅代表係。

515
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,220
會嘅立場咧，已經喺我哋誒。

516
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:19,510
大律師公會一三年十月嗰一份文件、嗰份意見書裏邊咧，已經羅列出嚟。基本上，我哋係支持呢一個修訂，主要係因為佢誒呢個修訂主要係簡化程序同埋減低個仲費。咁所以誒，由於我見到時間嘅關係咧，我就唔再有其他嘅補充，除非啊處。

517
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:21,420
或者其他，有其他嘅提問。

518
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:42,120
誒咁而家咧就有阿湯家華議員咁原因就而家暫時都係一位議員示意咧，我就畀你誒五分鐘，即係都會畀你講多少少鬆鬆。主席唔使咁多時間，即係我都唔想阻嗰啲同事時間。我即係好快咁睇過啦。咁其實裏邊嘅修訂係咪都係好技術？

519
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:58,060
性嘅修訂嚟嘅，噉啊原則性嘅問題睇起嚟似乎唔係太多。噉我哋既然係有呢個誒審議呢個誒呢個條例嘅機制，我哋留翻畀誒審議委員會去處理。係誒，仲有冇其他委員想發言？

520
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:19,670
誒可能我都誒即係都會問一下啦，即係頭先提到嗰個嘅誒審，即係嗰個修改嘅方向啦。第一咧，亦都提到咧，當然你係簡化咗佢咧係好嘅。咁譬如話，法院可以即係情係延長時限啦，法院可以隨時要求一啲嚴格啲嘅，即係。

521
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:39,680
用翻嚴格嘅程序啦。噉你知每一樣嘢都會有雙方嘅，即係每一個酌情權嘅使用都可能令到另外一方咧係不滿㗎嘛。咁誒會唔會喺呢一方面都會有更多清晰嘅指引，即係唔係話純粹就話誒酌情去誒考慮噉樣？

522
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,870
好。

523
01:39:41,150 --> 01:40:01,160
喂，主席喺做呢一個法例修訂嘅時候咧，我哋都會有一個誒誒practice direction，即係一個實務指示嘅，即係都會做一個實務指示出嚟咧，係希望可以咧令到有關人士咧係瞭解一個程序。噉我哋喺誒做法例修改嘅時候咧，都會有一個諮詢嘅過。

524
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:21,170
諮詢翻誒，即係律師會啊，大律師公會咁誒，即係大家都會較為清楚瞭解將來嗰個運作係點。咁至於喺誒每一個個案入邊咧，當然就個法官到最後就係佢可能係有一個酌情權去去考慮，究竟係咪需要誒用翻。

525
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:41,180
一個較為嚴格啲嘅一個狀書啦。咁但係呢個可能就係即係係一啲較為特殊嘅個案先會噉樣做。咁大部分嘅，因為我哋都係希望通過呢一個法例修訂之後咧，可以加快我個處理呢一方面嘅審索。多謝主席。係嗱，其實就明白嘅。

526
01:40:41,180 --> 01:41:01,190
簡化程序方便公眾咧係最好嘅，但係咧就喺行使酌情權嗰方面，特別你講譬如話啊呢一次咧我就誒唔簡化啦，我又要要求翻狀紙啦，譬如係噉。噉你嗰個原即係嗰個category，即係嗰個你哋嗰個理由咧，即係或者嗰個都應該咧係。

527
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:11,600
畀多少少大家，譬如你係咪係咪因為某一啲嘅情況底下嘅噉，就唔係話順水咧，就係誒就講話由法官去酌情去決定噉樣。

528
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:33,470
誒或者我係做一個好簡單嘅補充，因為咧喺一誒誒有一啲比較複雜嘅平等機會個案裏邊咧，如果係用一個即係誒我哋最新嘅模式，即係一啲誒表格嘅話，可能係會令到嗰件事情係幾難咧，係將個範圍係定定落嚟，咁可能會引致咧其後嘅一路即係有眾誒訴。

529
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:53,480
重嘅時候咧，引致嗰個即係訴訟人嘅時間或者係需要誒攞出嚟嘅嘅誒，即係誒法律嘅費用更加貴。所以咧，我哋其中一個考慮可能就係嗰個複雜性。即係如果一個好特殊、好特別、誒非常之複雜嘅個案裏邊咧，噉我哋誒法官有可能係覺得，如果用翻狀書咧，係能夠比較將嗰。

530
01:41:53,480 --> 01:42:13,490
嗰個嘅範圍係釐清得比較清楚，係減免咗日後一啲所謂非正審嘅一啲嘅申請嘅時候咧，係應該會更加便利。咁所以我哋嘅法官考慮嘅主要嘅目的咧，都係為咗即係兩邊嘅仲裁嘅時候咧，係無論佢哋嘅需要嘅時間啦，或者你所需要提出嘅即係法律嘅費用咧，都希望係最方。

531
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:21,810
我哋唔係淨係睇第一個誒工序，係希望成個流程咧係睇用邊一個方法咧係最便利到大家嘅。係誒。

532
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:42,100
其實都清楚㗎啦。咁頭先你哋提嘅嗰一啲咧，就係正正就係我提出嘅一啲方向，即係都有個依據嘅。即係行使酌情權嘅時候，大家都有個依據，以免即係是但一方都覺得你行使呢個酌情權，點解佢A咧佢就係噉樣，啊B咧又又又要用狀紙，佢以免有一啲。

533
01:42:42,100 --> 01:43:02,110
其中一方佢亦都覺得唔公道噉。如果你係有一啲清楚啲嘅依據，係係愛嚟做行使酌情權嗰個即係指引提出嚟咧，咁大家就會好清楚，即係都可能亦都有個預測。我呢個我呢呢個情況係咪屬於好複雜？係可能好大機會咧，係要有撞紙嘅噉，大家都可能會預。

534
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:09,590
計到嗰個情況咯，即係我覺得呢一方面咧，就係一個意見，你哋要研究嘅時候咧，都應該要考慮嘅嚇。

535
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:13,920
多謝主席，好冇？誒咁有冇其他嘅意見？

536
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:26,960
誒，如果冇其他意見咧，噉我都要問下委員誒，我哋是否支持或者係唔反對當局咧，就向立法會提交呢個條例草案嚇？

537
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:32,880
噉我哋咧，委員會咧係支持誒，你哋係將呢個條例草案咧係提交嘅。

538
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:51,120
噉就誒，如果係冇其他嘅意見咧，我哋今日嘅會議咧就誒結束啦。咁好多謝司法機構嘅代表同埋大陸消工會嘅代表，一直係係留到而家啦。噉我哋下一次開會嘅時間咧，係三月二十五號四點半。多謝大家。
