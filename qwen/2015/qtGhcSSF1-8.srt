1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,010
好，我哋夠人，亦都夠鐘開會啦。係請曬政府同埋團體代表入嚟。

2
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,270
好，誒。

3
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:35,950
歡迎誒政府代表啦，亦都誒多謝咁多位團體嚟到。我哋今日咧就係講緊誒呢個有關處理。

4
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,800
家庭暴力同性暴力喺外傭身上嘅。

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
咁當然咧，各位同事，大家知道。

6
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,870
外傭咧就唔可以當係家庭嘅一份子，但係佢哋的確係外籍嘅家庭傭工。

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,060
而佢哋如果發生有性暴力或者係一啲暴力事件咧，

8
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,400
如果亦都係一個佢嘅居所裏邊咧。

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,190
咁呢個情況咧，其實同一個家庭暴力嗰個情況咧，係有類同嘅。

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:22,780
咁即係如果用英文咧，其實我哋都係講緊domestic，即係喺翻即係同一屋檐下噉，所以呢個外籍家庭傭工咧，其實喺呢一個情況底下咧，我哋覺得呢個小組委員會咧。

11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,350
都值得係探討有關佢哋嘅需要。

12
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,680
咁即係我哋明白喺嗰個法例裏邊，即係如果講緊誒。

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,760
呢個誒家庭及同居。

14
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:55,050
伴侶嘅暴力條例咧，就冇包括呢個外籍僱工嘅。但係喺呢個小組委員會裏邊咧，我哋都覺得值得去探討。咁今日在席嘅誒政府官員，當然有勞福局啦，有社處啦，有誒警務處同埋有入境處嘅同事嘅。噉我哋誒今

15
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,670
今朝咧。

16
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:09,000
亦都會係誒，即係有一個公聽啦。噉我哋誒，如果政府唔介意咧，就我哋都係請即係團體嚟到同我哋講咗先，咁然後政府一評回應。

17
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:21,200
咁當然啦，即係我哋知道政府有一貫嘅做法，亦都有個政策，即係對於外籍用工，無論喺入境啊，或者喺誒誒呢個勞工僱傭方面嘅處理。

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,570
噉，但係我哋亦都明白咧，即係外籍傭工當佢面對呢啲家庭暴力或者性暴力嘅時候。

19
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,000
佢報咗案，誒開始進入司法程序嘅時候咧。

20
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:45,570
佢係往往嗰個僱傭關係會終止，而喺呢段時間咧，佢係唔可以再揾其他工作嘅。咁喺呢個司法程序。

21
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,100
未完嘅時候咧，有時佢哋需要繼續留喺香港，咁呢段時間可以好長。

22
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,800
可以係即係經年累月，咁呢段時間如果冇一個入息、冇一個支援嘅話咧，其實係相當困難。

23
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,060
咁所以今日咧，我哋覺得呢個誒係好值得探討嘅一個誒情況嘅。噉我哋。

24
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,390
首先咧就誒請咗團體發言先啦。咁團體咧，你哋有三分鐘嚇，大家把握時間。

25
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:26,930
就都係唔好意思，即係雖然係誒大家一場嚟到，但係我哋誒個會議嘅時間咧有限，咁所以咧就請大家把握時間三分鐘。咁今日嘅發言咧。

26
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:35,310
正如誒一向咧，都係唔會受到立法會嘅權力及特權條例保障嘅，即係嚴責自負咁解嘅啫。

27
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:43,490
噉我哋誒輪住咧，每一位咧就誒請大家按時發言啦。咁首先咧，我哋就請。

28
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,800
嗯。

29
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:52,260
Miss Holly Allen， from Helpers of Domestic Helpers， please， Miss Allen。

30
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,920
Okay, thank you, Mr. Cheng, for providing the background of the issues faced by migrant domestic workers who are subjected to violence.

31
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:21,700
Below the efforts of the authorities in pursuing prosecuting high-profile cases like that of Ariana, however, HTH and other organisations like us have dealt with many less even less serious cases that are not properly investigated and hence not prosecuted. Some complaints to the police were.

32
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,750
brush aside as mere labour disputes, and the victims were.

33
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:47,090
instead directed to go to the labour department. Cases that do get investigated languish in obscurity as victims wait in limbo for extended periods, often for several months, with little or no information provided as to the status of the case. Many domestic workers are forced to choose between seeking justice or earning a living. Due

34
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,810
對移民限制。

35
00:05:49,370 --> 00:06:09,380
The gaps in support services mean that many victims who have a family to support do not really have a choice but to abandon their quest for justice in order to be able to work. Failure in law enforcement, restrictive government policies and inadequacies in vital services for domestic workers or victims of violence, all work in concert towards denying many of many of them access.

36
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:17,740
access to justice. So these are our recommendations. There should be zero tolerance of violence, no matter how serious.

37
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:38,440
提供 sensitivity training for police officers and a special police unit should be formed to deal with domestic worker cases. With members recruited from the ethnic minority groups that speak the native languages of domestic workers, many interpreters lack competent language skills to provide accurate translations. So there is a need to provide professionally trained.

38
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,150
譯員，當受害者給 police 聲明。

39
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,600
and require these interpreters to abide by professional code of ethics.

40
00:06:45,880 --> 00:07:00,440
Fourth, provide support for basic needs such as food, shelter and medical services. Foreign domestic workers should continue to be eligible for subsidised healthcare at public hospitals while waiting for their cases to be resolved.

41
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:16,650
visa extension fee should be waived for domestic workers or engaged in legal proceedings. And sixth, most importantly, while stressing that two-week rule was necessary to provide domestic workers or to prevent domestic workers from job hopping.

42
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:37,350
The administration has not addressed the deterrent effect of such policy on domestic workers who wish to seek redress for mistreatment. So most domestic workers would rather work than rely on charity. This would not only enable them to continue supporting their families back home, it would help those who have been subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment.

43
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,030
regain a sense of self-respect and dignity.

44
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:56,460
If this is implemented, then the two previous recommendations—that is, waiving visa fees and providing support services or support for basic needs for domestic workers—would not be necessary, thereby saving public resources. Thank you.

45
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,820
多謝。Miss Allen，Next， we would like to have Miss Karen McAllen。

46
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:23,610
Hello, thank you very much. I would just point out some some issues that we do see arise, and I'm sure my friends and colleagues are quite well aware of as well. And although I have read the government's submission to this this panel.

47
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,790
certainly we hear quite a bit of.

48
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:47,370
incidents where police are called to the employer's home and the domestic worker's also home in place of work, and upon arrival at the scene, there there is no interpretation services. There is often often very much miscommunications, and the matter.

49
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,230
是 generally treated as an employment dispute.

50
00:08:50,780 --> 00:09:10,790
This puts a worker who is already in a vulnerable position, having living in the employer's home. The obviously the the point of having the police called usually means a contract and any hope of continuing that employment is over. Feeling that she is not able to necessarily avail herself of the police. Now some.

51
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:30,800
Some domestic workers do seek out assistance from NGOs and lawyers and are able to attain some assistance and do sometimes follow up later with the police. But I think it's that first incident handling that can be very much a deterrent from domestic workers exercising their rights. And I think whether it's

52
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:50,810
敏感度訓練或 awareness raising with the front line police officers who attend at the scene is quite critical, and referral to sources where the workers may receive assistance if need be. I think in cases where there's clear and extreme violence on the face of it, it might be different, but there's often

53
00:09:50,810 --> 00:10:01,040
cases where the police are called, and there has been incidents leading up to potentially threatening or physical violent confrontation.

54
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:11,370
But because it may not be blatantly, there's not no one's bleeding at the scene. The the next steps towards redress aren't necessarily taken.

55
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:28,070
所以我認為那係好重要，和一啲其他事，我會簡單提一提。係，家務工人如果想追蹤法律救濟，移民部的政策係容許變更工作，所以佢哋可以。

56
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:48,460
start a new position having having to have been forced to leave the former employer's home effectively is very unclear. There's a sort of generalised indication that where there's evidence of abuse, although what the extent of the evidence required or the extent of the abuse required, I mean, is verbal

57
00:10:48,460 --> 00:11:05,220
abuse enough or threats enough or does it have to be a horrible Oriana type of situation where it's that extreme? So I think clarification of the policies from the immigration department and how they're applied would would certainly assist.

58
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,200
Thank you.

59
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:26,500
Thank you, Mr. Clement。誒，跟住我哋請關注暴力誒關注婦女性暴力協會嘅黃秀容女士。係，唔該主席。咁整體而言咧，我哋覺得外傭遇上升暴力咧，如果要報警咧，唔單止失去工作啦，亦都冇咗住宿啦、膳食同埋醫療保障。噉我哋覺得政府係需要誒，如果真係要

60
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:46,510
去保障佢哋嘅權益咧，係需要設立一個恆常嘅機制去處理外傭被性侵犯嘅跟進服務。咁以致警方啦、勞工處啦、社會處入警處咧，都能夠有效咁協調啦外傭報警後嘅跟進。咁因為時間關係，我就淨係帶出三點啦。第一點咧，就我哋認為而家入警處同警處嘅協調。

61
00:11:46,510 --> 00:12:06,520
係好唔足夠噉。對於被性暴力對待嘅外傭嚟講咧，佢哋因為即係趁侵犯報警啦。如果畀僱主侵犯報警，結果係要重新去揾工作嘅。咁但係都去揾工作揾到新僱主啦，噉就要透過入境處申請即係新僱主啦。咁雖然外傭咧嗰時候都得到警察嘅資料去畀入境處證。

62
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:13,830
名受害人咧真係因為性侵犯去報警求助，咁但係咧入境處咧批核嘅程序係好好冗長啊！

63
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:34,120
嗰時候要等兩至三個月，到一批嘅時候咧，個新僱主已經等唔切啦。咁最難以理解咧，就係有啲入境處，即係唔單止要受害人提供口供字，仲要受害人咧重新講一次受害經歷，令到受害人咧係經歷二度傷害。噉我哋嘅社工、扶養社工曾經問入境處主任：點解要受害人再講多次咧？噉佢哋就話咧。

64
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:54,130
警察就還警察，入境處就還入境處嘅噉樣。咁此外咧，當警方係要求受害人係要留港等候上庭作證嘅時候咧，警方就會按照案件嘅進展咧，向入境處去推薦受害人可以留港嘅期限嘅。但係入境處咧，往往就唔會跟隨警察嘅推薦嘅喎。唔知噉佢哋就唔知用啲咩準則。

65
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,200
去決定留港年期嘅，咁比如啦，誒警察會推薦咧。

66
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:18,490
受害人可以留港三個月嘅，咁入境處咧就誒有時只會批一個月，咁長啲就兩個月啦。咁而每一次批核咧係一百九十蚊，咁大部分呢啲批費咧都係由受害人支付嘅喎。咁如果一個排期，譬如你當等一至一一年半噉樣，咁受害人咧就可能要去十幾次入境處啦，同埋自行咁支付千幾蚊。噉我哋亦～

67
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:38,500
係好唔合理嘅，因此我哋覺得其實警處同埋入境處係咪要多啲協調咧，以致到咧即係或者甚至入境處公開個pat機制啦，究竟點解唔跟警處嗰個recommendation咧噉樣？咁第二點咧係有關勞工處嘅，咁一般情況之下咧，外傭遭到僱主侵犯報警咧，就算係即時終止合約啦，但係僱主話。

68
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:58,510
或因為咧拖欠薪金或者終止合約所要求咧誒嘅代通知金咧，即係唔畀個個或者機票都唔畀嗰個外用啊！咁而家其實冇一個恆常機制咧，喺警方接案之後咧就通報入境處同埋勞工處去跟進協助嘅。咁好多用工因為唔清楚法例或者追討嘅方法咧，而攞唔到賠償同埋補。

69
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:18,520
因此咧，我哋建議係咪可以建立機制，當受害人去報警後咧，警方係應該喺受害人嘅同意之下咧，向勞工處咧係通報有關性侵嘅事件。咁另外咧，勞工處可以咧係主動向受害人提供協助。最後一點咧，就係關於嗰個誒，即係上庭嘅問題。咁因為等待上庭要超過一。

70
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:38,530
啦，咁而家政府都冇提供任何長期住宿嘅安排同埋生活安排嘅。而政府喺第十二第十二點文件入邊去提供，佢話有提供個兩週嘅短期住宿係解決唔到問題嘅。因此，我哋建議政府可以去長期資助一啲嘅住宿中心，並且安排一啲食物啦。咁唔單止解決咗受人嘅住宿，亦都係因為基於佢哋嘅獨。

71
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:58,540
特嘅文化同埋宗教嘅需要之下，有一個較合理嘅適應嘅環境，等佢哋長期居住，亦都可以回應受害人嘅需要。咁呢個咧，亦都係誒有啲人會講話啊。咁其實誒嗰啲受害人都可以住喺啲agent啊、領事館啊嗰度，但係大家唔好忘記嗰度冇一個治療嘅環境㗎，亦都冇註冊社工，亦都冇任何提供服務嘅地。

72
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:18,550
方啦，以致到咧受害人係唔可以重創生復復原嘅。而政府又都有提到話啊，佢哋有兩個星期嘅短期住宿，但係你諗下喎，佢報警，跟住佢仲要好多程序要做，根本係做唔到輔導嘅嗰兩個禮拜。咁其實佢要搞掂曬啲嘢，先至可以去集中精神做輔導啦。咁所以我哋認為受害人咧係應該即係有一個。

73
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:38,560
免費同埋提供長期住宿嘅地方嘅服務啦，令到佢哋有個安全嘅環境。咁大家都可以睇下我哋嘅意見書，唔該。好，唔該曬黃秀蘭女士。跟住請新婦女協進會麥嘉蕾小姐。係唔該主席。咁咧誒，其實咧而家咧誒現時咧香港咧外籍家務工嘅數目已經係三十幾萬人啦。其實咧係。

74
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:58,570
佔咗人口比例嘅四點五個percent，其實咧咁大嘅人口比例咧，咁政府其實需要咧按住個人口咧，為誒外傭咧提供一啲支援嘅服務，包括咗誒係應付勞資糾紛啦、法律程序或者因為受虐或者其他原因咧而需要嘅短暫住宿場地，即係譬如誒我但係。

75
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:18,580
呢個咧其實咧，誒我哋所見到咧，之前咧Ariana咧，誒或者Alex咧，噉佢哋咧所遇到咧，誒嘅各樣嘅受虐嘅情況啦，咁其實呢個唔係個別僱主嘅問題，呢個其實只係反映緊咧成個家務工制度咧已經係失衡，但係政府對呢啲嘢咧係其實全部都係咧冇冇任何。

76
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:38,590
嘅支援同埋關注啦，咁其實咧，誒，我哋譬如嘅由誒Ariana咧、Alice嗰個個，我哋都見到，其實咧，因為咧，誒外傭咧，佢需要喺僱主嘅屋企嗰度咧，誒強制有一個即係一個強制同住嘅規定啊，所以令到咧，誒外籍家務工咧喺誒工作上面咧，佢遇到危險嘅機會，其實係比咧。

77
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:58,600
我哋一般嘅打工仔女咧係高好多，而家咧其實咧政府咧佢冇特別就外傭家務工嘅處境提供相關嘅支援嘅，所以佢哋就算遇到困難都唔知喺咩地方可以尋求到援助啦。咁其實誒，即係譬如我哋都見到好多誒，即係外傭受虐嘅個案啊，但係呢啲受害人咧因為唔熟悉香港。

78
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:18,610
嘅情況，再加上咧中介同埋咧警方，其實佢哋冇提供咧一啲恰當嘅援助，就令到咧佢哋冇辦法可以誒，即係有有有一啲適當嘅誒誒幫助啦，亦都唔夠膽離開僱主屋企，因為佢已經會無家可歸，所以佢哋就會可能會因為呢個原因而白白留喺僱主屋企。

79
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:38,620
而受到更加多嘅暴力，其實中介公司係冇可能提到一啲恰即係提供到一啲適當嘅援助畀佢。再加上埋咧誒，即係譬如中介公司咧，佢講嗰啲工人宿舍其實同集中營係冇分別。佢其實誒每每用任何一樣嘢咧，都係要收錢，包括佢上網啊、誒誒食嘢都要自己啊，咁住嚟嘅地方又要畀錢。

80
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:58,630
咁其實全部都係誒喺一個冇收入嘅情況之下，其實對佢嚟講係好難繼續留喺香港去處理佢之前所面對嘅各樣嘅問題咯。咁所以咧，其實咧誒，即係而家而家務工咧，其實喺受到咧暴力對待之後咧，佢需要嘅除咗係要處理嗰個誒面對嘅暴力事件之外咧，其實仲有咧嗰個僱。

81
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:18,640
用關係同埋居留嘅問題啦，咁其實係同一般庇護中心咧，佢哋嗰個誒服務提供係非常之唔同，噉佢又要處理埋語言障礙啊，可能心理上面啊，或者顧人關係上面嘅各樣嘅情況啦，都要處理啦，所以其實佢係需要一啲好針對性嘅、好特別嘅服務係誒提供畀佢哋啦，咁所以我。

82
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:38,650
我哋其實咧就會建議咧係要為嗰啲家誒受到個人暴力嘅受害人咧提供嘅誒誒誒適當嘅庇護服務啦，畀佢哋啦誒，包括可能係誒即係庇護中心啊各樣噉。另外咧，外籍家務工喺受到唔同誒暴力對待之後咧，係要協助佢哋處理嗰個僱傭關。

83
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:58,660
係以及最緊要嘅一點咧，就係其實喺佢哋面對呢一啲嘅暴力事件之前咧，其實有冇機會可以接觸到一啲資訊，其誒令到佢哋知道，如果出事嘅時候可以有啲咩誒嘢可以幫到佢哋咧？噉樣好唔該曬麥嘉雷，跟住請國際家務工聯會嘅葉佩如女士。

84
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:58,980
係。

85
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:19,340
係唔該，主席。頭先啊，主席都有提過，其實往往就係啲外傭遭受暴力或者虐待咧，佢會經過即係數以年計嘅司法程序嘅時間啦。咁所以其實誒，舊年啊，警務處長曾偉雄就話回應阿Rena一案嘅時候，就話香港幾十萬外傭。

86
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:39,350
即係一年只係得三四十單嘅案件，比例係非常之少。其實呢個聽落係好荒謬，但係咧，其實正正就係反映咧，啲外傭其實係好難去挺身而出，去為佢自己嘅公義去尋求佢嘅權利嘅。咁香港政府咧，其實一路都係。

87
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:59,360
係講緊咧，香港嘅外傭同其他本地嘅勞工嘅待遇一樣，可以去勞工處可以去報警等等。其實咧，佢一路都唔肯講誒外傭同香港勞工有啲咩唔同咧。第一包括咧，即係佢哋嘅工作場所，即係話佢哋嘅住所咧。

88
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:19,370
根本就唔會好似其他工廠啊、商鋪噉樣有巡查啦。第二咧，外傭佢係有中介費咧，即係佢有一個債項啦，所以佢亦都要被逼壓忍嘅虐待啦。第三，佢哋亦都係一有舉報事件個案嘅時候，佢哋就會被炒，就冇收入啦，亦都係冇住處，無家可歸，無家。

89
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:39,380
家可歸，仲係咧，往往咧，佢哋係個家庭支柱。咁其實我哋訪問過誒其中一位老師，浸大英文係嘅老師Hans那家啦。噉佢過去幾年咧訪問咗四百幾個外傭。噉佢話咧，其實近半嘅外傭都係受到身體嘅襲擊嘅情況。咁平機會陣間佢哋都會講啦，佢哋。

90
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:59,390
去年嘅調查發現咧，三分一嘅受訪者外傭咧都係話佢哋會捱性侵犯嘅。噉我哋覺得咧，香港係一個法治嘅社會啦，其實香港政府必須要承擔責任，令到佢哋外傭可以尋求公義。咁誒，我亦都誒回應響應。

91
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:19,400
其他誒在座嘅團體覺得香港政府應該要提供一啲嘅支援同埋資助，令到受弱嘅外傭可以有一個住所庇護中心。咁政府其實都可以向參考下誒海外嘅政府嘅做法啦。譬如喺台灣咧，台灣政府就有資助一啲嘅民間團體。

92
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:39,410
喺去經營庇護中心，而按每一名嘅受虐人咧，就給予五百蚊台幣嘅資助，令到佢有一個生活費啊、誒食物同埋嗰個庇護所嘅經營啦。另外咧，誒佢哋台灣亦都有一個勞工權益嘅基金，咁嗰啲嘢積災受害者咧，亦都可以申請一啲。

93
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,630
嘅生活費嘅。

94
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:53,310
咁咧，我哋本會咧亦都重新咧促請政府咧係必須向呢啲外傭提供一啲誒必須嘅支援，令到佢哋可以尋求司法嘅公義。唔該。

95
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:00,070
好唔該曬葉女士，跟住我哋請誒，we like to invite Pastor Danilo Borlado。

96
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,140
I'm. Good morning, everyone.

97
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:12,750
我係Speaking in behalf of the service coalition of service providers for Hong Kong.

98
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,480
啊，for ethnic minorities in Hong Kong。

99
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,760
It is very easy to classify foreign domestic helpers.

100
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:30,150
作為人口，那係覆蓋由他們的僱傭合約，和係喺勞工部門的管轄範圍內。

101
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:48,260
但的 care、 protection、 well-being and welfare of contracted foreign helpers cannot be relegated to the employment contracts or as or as a responsibility of employers, recruitment agencies and consulates alone.

102
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,870
香港。

103
00:22:51,150 --> 00:23:00,310
作為 host country， has invited these foreign domestic helpers because they can help sustain their families and its economy.

104
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,860
no one forced Hong Kong to take these foreign domestic helpers.

105
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,490
香港社會 needs them.

106
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,730
作為 invited workers， they came with skills， expertise。

107
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,410
和 willing hearts to be of help because.

108
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:29,710
在process，they do，they too can help their families。 reciprocity and mutual benefits should should be hinged on respect and perseverance of human。

109
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,500
human dignity and trust.

110
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:50,760
作為NGOs，我們被驅動由我們的憐憫去服務最脆弱的人，尤其是受各種形式的虐待的受害者，並成為一個可獲得的資源，因為我們在地面上最接近我們感受到的痛苦和聽到的痛苦。

111
00:23:51,040 --> 00:24:07,400
yet we are not government. We also cannot perform what roles the government of Hong Kong has to fulfil to protect and safeguard the interest of the foreign domestic helpers who's who serve the Hong Kong families most.

112
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,770
Therefore, we recommend the following.

113
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,690
僱員們，應該提供一個一般的文化引導。

114
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:24,420
of the culture of their hard foreign domestic helpers to facilitate mutual understanding and respect.

115
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:45,090
Number two, create a direct hotline service for domestic helpers victims of abuse with police, the social welfare department and labour department with interpretation service. Number three, provision of funds because they are not allowed to work while.

116
00:24:45,090 --> 00:25:05,100
undergoing their pursuing their cases, funds should be provided to assist and support the food, shelter, counselling, visa extension, medical services, transportation needs and other practical needs through a defined government agency.

117
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:25,110
number four, creating help desks assigned officers for foreign domestic helpers who are victims of abuse in police, hospitals and outpatient clinics via the medical social services and the labour department. and number five and the last, creation of mechanism for foreign domestic helpers to

118
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:42,770
report abusive employers to the Hong Kong Immigration Department. Creation of Hong Kong Immigration Department blacklist of abusive employers to prevent recurring abuses of the same of same employers as a deterrent and protection mechanism.

119
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:49,910
Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Bolado. 啊，跟住請啊，風雨蘭嘅陳慧思小姐。

120
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,180
Thank you. I'm actually going to speak in English.

121
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:07,070
Okay, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I represent the We Stand project of Rain Lily, which provides crisis intervention services specifically to migrant worker sexual violence victims.

122
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:21,760
The We Stand project also focuses on prevention work through community education workshops, talks and groups, and dissemination of information about sexual violence and victims' rights to various ethnic minority and migrant worker organisations.

123
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:33,870
所以，over the past three years of the West End project, we have observed that one of the primary stresses faced by migrant worker women who have suffered sexual violence is financial.

124
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:52,990
most often the abuser is a member of the employer's household, therefore termination of employment is common. It's a common byproduct of sexual abuse. Now the cessation of income paired with lengthy legal proceedings, which can be anything up to 18 months, maybe even two years.

125
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,950
creates massive pressure for a woman who is already undergoing the severe trauma of sexual violence.

126
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:19,420
Now it has been suggested that the victim should be provided airfare to go to return to her home country and come back to Hong Kong when it's time to testify in court. However, when we have spoken to domestic helpers, they have stated that this would not be an ideal solution.

127
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:36,880
as it would be unlikely that the victim would return to Hong Kong to testify after going back to life at home, and it would also put the victim in a position to be re-traumatised by having to explain to her family and friends why she is returning home so suddenly.

128
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:48,360
所以，我們 therefore 提出，number one，我們 empower 美國工人受害者， to continue to be financially self-supported by making the process of applying

129
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,980
for to immigration department for change of employer to be more expedient and more sensitive to sexual violence cases.

130
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:15,880
It has been the experience of our clients to have to face lengthy waiting times for this process. We're talking a number of four, five, six months, by which time the application has been approved. The employer simply has not been able to wait and has hired someone else.

131
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:28,150
It also has been the experience of our clients that immigration department officers have not had a sympathetic attitude to such cases, nor been trusting of victims' accounts of sexual violence.

132
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:49,030
Where in situations the victims are not able to find new employment, maybe due to certain medical or psychological issues caused by the incident, we highlight the model that's used in the UK, where the Crown Prosecution Service bears the cost of witness expenses.

133
00:28:49,030 --> 00:29:09,040
和 Allowances. This includes loss of earnings, travel expenses, food, etc. We would propose that the Hong Kong Police Force or Social Welfare Department provide a similar expenses and allowance subsidy to witnesses to cover basic living costs such as rent, food, transport.

134
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:29,050
transport costs for the duration of the legal proceedings. We believe that the aforementioned measures would be the optimum solution to the financial problems faced by migrant worker victims of sexual violence. Thank you. 好，唔該曬陳惠思小姐，跟住請民主黨嘅梁榮恩小姐。係，多謝主席。誒，民主黨。

135
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:49,060
一直非常關注當局處理家庭暴力同埋性暴力問題嘅政策，而喺涉及外籍家庭用工嘅家庭暴力同埋性暴力嘅個案，我哋都非常重視嘅。因為政府民警指出，截至二零一五年六月底，本港嘅外籍人數外傭人數已經超過三十誒三萬六千六。

136
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,620
唔一樣。

137
00:29:49,900 --> 00:30:04,060
主要係來自菲律賓同埋印尼，其餘包括來自泰國、印度、斯里蘭卡、孟加拉等地。大部分外傭都係婦女，而佢哋受到僱主同埋僱主家人嘅虐待同埋性騷擾個案屢見不鮮。

138
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:24,380
近期矚目嘅印傭Elana事件，顯示佢喺2013年5月至到2014年1月在港工作期間，遭受僱主虐打同埋有輪，身體多處腫脹同埋攰攣，估計被虐已經長達半年時間。事件震驚國際，最終區域法院。

139
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:39,470
裁定僱主罪名成立。喺事件曝光之後，我亦都飛到去印尼去探望Ariana同埋佢爹哋，瞭解個實實況係點樣。其實喺Ariana受虐嘅初期，曾經向中介公司求助啊，但係佢冇得到真正嘅幫助。

140
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:59,770
聯合國消除對婦女歧視委員會喺二零一四年十月二十三日喺日內亞舉行會議，審議香港特別行政區政府就履行聯合國消除對婦女一切歧形式歧視嘅公約嘅情況所提交報告。誒，本人同埋誒包。

141
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:19,780
包括劉慧卿議員啦，同埋其他嘅團體喺當時亦都係向誒聯合個委員會反映意見嘅委員會。其後喺十一月七日發表結論意見，其中一項係關注女性外籍家庭用工受到剝削同埋面對不利嘅工作條件，並促請當局加強保。

142
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:39,790
保障外傭免受歧視，以及唔會被僱主同埋職業介紹所誒剝削嘅外傭離鄉別井到到香港工作喺香港理應受到平等嘅對待，因此民主黨建議有關嘅部門應多向佢哋推廣應有嘅權益，尤其係以該國嘅語言喺佢哋經。

143
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,870
經常出現嘅地方作宣傳。

144
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:56,360
此外，有關職業介紹所嘅問題日益增多，當局亦都必須更加多嘅巡查職業介紹所，並加強執法，打擊無牌經營嘅中介公司，以確保外傭在港嘅權益。

145
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:16,650
勞工處早前亦都表示，正為業界草擬一份實務指引，列明職業介紹所可以進行同埋需要避免嘅行為。當局應該盡早完成有關嘅計劃，並必須諮詢有關嘅外容團體。今日嚟咗好多嘅團體啦，去了解誒明白佢實際嘅需。

146
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,820
要多謝。

147
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,430
好，唔該曬梁泳欣小姐。Next，we like to invite誒Miss。

148
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:42,720
Bethune House established in 1986 to provide refuge to distressed Asian women migrants in Hong Kong. For more than 28 years, we have provided refuge and assisted thousands of women in crisis, women who have suddenly made unemployed.

149
00:32:42,750 --> 00:33:02,760
May have been who have experienced exploitation and some form of physical and sexual abuse, were victimised by sex and labour trafficking, have no means to secure their entitlements nor to survive in Hong Kong, while they pursue their quest for justice. As noted in the newspaper number C. close parenthesis two one six eight

150
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:22,770
A three slash fourteen to fifteen bracket zero six paragraph thirteen. Some members of the panel manpower acknowledged the two week rule had deterred foreign domestic helpers from lodging claims when they were mistreated or abused by their employers. In paragraph fourteen, it was clarified that under exceptional circumstances, including where there was

151
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:33,320
Evidence that the worker had been abused or exploited, the foreign domestic workers could apply for change of employer in Hong Kong without first returning to their places of origin.

152
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:43,930
The statement below provides Bethunahsby on how the support of foreign domestic helpers can be strengthened under circumstances where there was evidence that the worker had been abused.

153
00:33:44,590 --> 00:34:04,600
Where a foreign domestic worker had been abused by the employer, the worker typically has to go through the following: the worker reported the police for investigation; the visa has to be extended to pursue the case. Number two, the corresponding employment contract would be terminated, and depending on the outcome success, such employment contract termination might result.

154
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:24,610
在勞工爭議，and the worker could seek help from the labour department. Additionally, the worker could apply for change of employer in Hong Kong. However, any new employment would be subject to the police case being concluded. Thus, during the period of police investigation and subsequent court processes, the worker loses the opportunity for

155
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,990
employment，which was the original purpose of coming to Hong Kong。

156
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:41,260
貝通歐斯 believes that in cases where there is evidence that the worker had been abused, support should be provided to the workers to enable them to have a fair opportunity to seek justice and to minimise the impact to the worker.

157
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:48,540
我highlight below the key needs of the foreign domestic worker when a police and labour case are being pursued.

158
00:34:49,110 --> 00:35:09,120
一 place to stay, food and subsistence during the period of the police and labour case, medical support, access to medical system in Hong Kong ceased when the contracts are terminated, psychological support and counselling, unemployment dispute and trauma, free visa extension, allow to process new contract.

159
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,720
support their families back home.

160
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:27,020
如Highlighted above, currently the migrant service providers provided most of the needs of the foreign domestic workers when they pursue the police and labour cases. Abuse cases can involve a lengthy investigation process, thus the burden to shelter providers and NGOs heavy.

161
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:38,050
貝敦納斯提出為政府支持外國和家工人，於期間的警察調查、court processes和勞工爭議，以人權為基礎。謝謝。

162
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:58,340
Thank you, Miss Antonio。跟住請賴婉琪。誒，多謝主席。誒，我想指出咧，部分僱主咧暴力對待外傭嘅方式，其實並不限於咧嚴重肢體暴力或者強姦嘅。其實方式可以包括譬如恐嚇啦、唔準食嘢啦，或者向外傭展示性器官等等嘅，而且。

163
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:18,350
發生暴力嘅地點咧，可以喺香港境外呢啲情況咧，都係而家嘅政策咧，明嚟能夠處理到嘅。噉，譬如第一類型誒，肢體暴力咁受害人誒A小姐啦，就我之前訪問嘅一個誒內容。噉佢廿三歲，噉佢嘅僱主咧係一對夫婦，丈夫咧係香港人，太太咧就係內地人。

164
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:38,360
而誒A小姐咧，大部分時間咧都係安排喺咧深圳福田工作嘅，而非合約上面咧列明嘅香港住址。咁A小姐就表示咧，其實太太咧以往咧都曾經打佢嘅，但係最多隻會打手。咁後嚟咧就越嚟越過分啦，會打個頭部啦，試過咧用教剪咧打佢嘅頭頂，令佢咧受傷流血嘅。

165
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,480
咁太太咧又會用腳踢佢。

166
00:36:40,760 --> 00:37:00,770
第二類型誒語言暴力，亦都真係恐嚇A小姐咧，不時咧受到太太嘅恐嚇嘅。譬如太太咧就曾經對佢講話：誒，你試下逃走啊！我話燒咗你嘅護照同身份證嘅，再抌你去一度咧冇人識你嘅地方。如果我發現咧你照顧唔好，令到我個女受傷咧，你都要有一定，你都要有一樣嘅傷痕。

167
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,100
係。

168
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:12,700
第三類型嘅暴力就係虐待，噉嘅方式就係唔準食嘢。咁有一日咧，太太咧就刻意咧唔畀A小姐食飯，令佢咧挨餓咗一整日嘅。

169
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:32,990
咁A小姐其實就誒咬忍咗一年幾，因為佢覺得自己咧，其實佢就冇證據咧，可以指證到太太，噉就一直都咬忍啦。咁最後不過佢都真係擔心咧，自己會畀太太打死啊，咁所以就趁一個星期日嘅例假咧，就翻香港並向咧誒即係由外傭團體設立嘅庇護中心咧求助嘅。

170
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:53,310
咁第四類型嘅暴力咧，其實係性騷擾。咁受害人啊，B小姐二十八歲，咁僱主咧就係一名嘅中年女人。咁有時候咧，屋企咧只會得翻B小姐同埋咧僱主嘅男朋友。咁當單位淨係得B B小姐同埋僱主嘅男朋友嘅時候咧，僱。

171
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:13,320
僱主嘅男朋友咧，有時會冇著上衫嘅，咁後來咧就連褲都冇著，就喺sofa度坐。咁B小姐就覺得其實僱主嘅男朋友咧係刻意咧，趁淨係得同佢單獨相處嘅時候咧，就裸露身體，包括下體嘅。咁而B小姐咧每次只能夠即係低頭迴避啦，就唔敢向僱主投。

172
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:33,330
投訴噉，所以其實我想指出就係，當外傭面對較輕微嘅暴力或者性騷擾嘅時候，譬如就係打手或者係男僱主咧冇著上衫嘅時候咧，都會覺得自己冇證據而唔敢求助，令到即係僱主覺得自己可以繼續無法無天噉樣。噉，所以我希望會唔會喺政策上面可以有啲改善，令到可以對僱。

173
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,790
即係內容有更全面嘅保障。

174
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,770
好，唔該曬。

175
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:57,520
主席，Next we'd like to have Miss Cynthia Talack of Mission for Migrant Workers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Hong Kong government's leave-in policy for foreign domestic workers makes it mandatory for them to leave with their employers, making them especially vulnerable to violence in a domestic setting.

176
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:11,880
世界衞生組織的定義，暴力可以被解讀為物理、心理和精神傷害，造成對暴力受害者或目睹暴力的旁觀者的傷害，在家庭環境中。

177
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:32,170
在我們自己的經驗，約37起性 abuse、性騷擾、rape、身體暴力，包括Erwina的個案，佔2014年我們警務案件的14.2%，簡單地顯示，外籍家庭傭工與僱主同住，同樣脆弱。

178
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:38,260
to domestic violence, but are unfortunately not included in the domestic violence ordinance.

179
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:51,420
therefore there should be a legislation providing protection for migrant workers who are victims of domestic violence, such as allowing them to apply for an injunction restricting their abuser for further harassment.

180
00:39:51,700 --> 00:40:04,270
支持服務，such as free counselling and education on how to report cases of violence, as well as how to protect themselves, should also be provided for foreign domestic workers who are witnesses of domestic violence.

181
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:14,370
There should be a living allowance that is provided to foreign domestic workers who are victims of domestic violence while they pursue their cases. There should be government support.

182
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:34,800
to find shelters. When domestic workers suffer from physical and/or sexual violence, they lose their job. They lose all rights that goes with a temporary residency. But they need to stay in Hong Kong, wait for the investigation, extend their visa, but are not allowed to work. In general, the government should.

183
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:52,870
provide more assistance to foreign domestic workers who are victims and survivors of domestic violence instead of making them rely on NGOs which have limited resources. Otherwise, allow them to work for their subsistence. That way, also it does not become a deterrent to report a violent incident.

184
00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:06,340
That's it for the mission for migrant workers, Mr. Chair, which is in alliance with the Coalition of Service Providers for Ethnic Minorities. Okay, thank you, Cynthia. I understand that Sister Nisparos would not speak for now.

185
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,530
Okay.

186
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:27,820
誒，跟住我哋請自由黨嘅李振強先生。誒，多謝主席。咁其實咧，即係今日大家都講有關於外傭嘅家庭暴力或者性暴力嗰方面啦。咁其實即係我自己覺得，即係喺一個外傭住咗喺僱主嗰度，咁除咗係話外傭遇即係有機會遇著呢啲嘅問題嘅時候。

187
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:47,830
僱主其實有時候都會遇著依啲噉嘅唔同嘅誒虐待啊、暴力啊噉嘅性，尤其是其實我哋啲僱主點解會請啲工人、請啲外傭？其實第一佢哋真係幫到我哋手，第二就係話我哋希望佢哋可以融入我哋家庭，我哋唔希望見到依啲噉嘅情況發生。咁當然，如果一旦有啲噉嘅情況，

188
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:56,270
無論係咩事都好，我哋都好希望佢哋都可以挺身而出，去尋求一啲嘅援助同埋一啲嘅法律上嘅處理。

189
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:04,830
但係事實上，我哋香港嘅僱主其實好多時點誒，將我哋嘅屋企人，包括老人家同小朋友，都誒。

190
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:25,140
交低咗畀啲工人去照顧，令到我哋可以誒安枕無憂咁去出去揾兩餐去拼搏。但係往往事實上好多時相反，其實最近好多時新聞都講到，甚至外傭嘅僱主嘅嘅B B嘅小朋友，甚至老人家都被虐待。咁其實又點咧？咁其實即係有啲嘢政府係咪應該要？

191
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,610
做多啲嘅宣傳嘅工作咧，其實呢個時候其實政府就往往就宣傳不足。

192
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,460
宣傳不足，第一就係話，第一見到葉偉良案之後發生。

193
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:49,110
政府就又話會推廣個中介嘅實用手冊、實務手冊。到而家依一刻、今時今日啦，過年半啦，嗰本實務手冊個draft去咗邊咧？大家有冇見到咧？想請問咁多嘅立法會議員。

194
00:42:49,950 --> 00:43:09,960
第二其實就係話，即係講即係政府嘅嘢，就係淨係淨係誒頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫痛，醫醫醫醫醫腳。咁其實即係大家都見到政府佢可以做得更多，但係佢係唔係有機會可以聽聆聽我哋更多嘅聲音咧？

195
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:22,180
包括我哋僱主嗰嗰方面，其實僱主好簡單，僱主係需要一個好嘅工人，而工人亦都需要一個好嘅僱主，一個係係第一互相尊重、互相包容、互相去融合。

196
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:42,470
但係最大嘅問題就係話，當一啲工人有時，我哋啲僱主遇到工人係想搏炒啊、偷嘢啊，甚至虐待小朋友嘅時候咧，噉我哋又唔知佢點面對，因為我哋只有亞支係黃連，第繼續容忍呢個工人去做呢啲噉嘅非法嘅行為，而我哋亦都唔識得去做，因為如果我哋再請第二個工人，入境處嗰邊咧，亦都會用幾個月嘅時間去請，我哋亦都唔可以請。

197
00:43:42,470 --> 00:44:02,480
等幾個月嘅假喺屋企度，咁所以其實依依樣嘢其實又係雙向嘅。咁最後我亦都想問翻即係勞工處嗰邊啊，即係有啲中介話畀我知喂，其實即係如果啲工人向你報警啊，向啲工僱主報警啊，就算無論點都好喺定罪之前，定罪之前佢你亦都一樣要支付翻佢哋全數嘅。

198
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,720
人工嘅，我想瞭解翻呢個係咪真？

199
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,370
誒，最後最後，我希望即係主席可以。

200
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:21,260
持平啲。如果除咗係外傭嗰邊受到依個性暴力之後，我哋其實啲僱主都亦都會受到好多唔同嘅暴力嘅對待。希望你都係有翻個公聽會，聽一聽我哋僱主嘅聲音。多謝主席。

201
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,900
好啊，李生，我哋啱啱聽咗你嘅聲音。

202
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,300
跟住誒，請評議會嘅朱崇文。

203
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:37,890
唔該，主席。誒，平機會今次我哋誒想講嘅咧，就係話其實除咗係誒啲工人係免受係誒性暴力啊，一啲誒。

204
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:58,180
其他嘅暴力嘅對待之外咧，其實咧亦都係受到性別歧視條例嘅保障嘅，因為條例底下有一個性性騷擾嘅違法行為啦。簡單嚟講，性騷擾就係話誒，如果你對一個人做出一啲不受歡迎、涉及性嘅行徑，而令到對方係冒犯、侮辱或者驚誒威嚇嘅話咧，呢個係性騷擾。咁呢個係一個民事嘅侵。

205
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,690
權行為嚟嘅，即係換句話講，除咗嗰個侵犯嘅人，可能面對刑事嘅指控咧。

206
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:23,980
其實受屈人咧係可以向我哋投訴，同埋攞一啲誒民事嘅賠償嘅。噉就包括係即係感情上嘅傷害嘅賠償嘅。咁但係誒唔知點解咧，就好多人咧對呢個法例咧都仲係好似唔係幾認識噉樣。其實我哋舊年咧就做咗一個誒調查嘅問卷調查，噉就訪問咗一。

207
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,360
千二百名誒。

208
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:39,890
誒印尼同埋菲律賓籍嘅外地嘅傭工，噉佢哋原來過去嘅一年裏面咧，就有六點五percent嘅人咧，係面對過唔同形式嘅性騷擾嘅。譬如頭先有啲港姐講話，佢哋係喺屋企裏面。

209
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:54,480
啲男嘅僱主或者佢嘅朋友咧，係除晒、除晒咁坐喺度，咁呢個咧就係喺性方面營咗一個敵意嘅環境咧。呢個都係一個性騷擾嚟嘅。其實唔係話冇嘢做嘅，係可以投訴，亦都可以誒誒即誒即爭呢個賠償嘅。

210
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:14,770
咁誒，其實我哋見到個問題可能喺邊度咧？好多時候，我哋做一啲宣傳嘅活動，我哋其實做好多㗎啦，包括廣告啦，包括係透過唔同嘅地方派一啲單張畀佢哋啦。其實入境嗰陣時候咧，其實成沓嘢香港嘅法例啊，包括我哋平機嘅法例咧，都有啲單張畀佢嘅。不過我哋聽到好多即係嗰啲外傭講咧，就係話嗰啲中。

211
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,620
中介公司。

212
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:35,980
一攞咗之後咧，跟住就攞手劈咗去收咗去㗎啦。噉我哋其實都建議有啲方法可以做嘅。舉例，譬如話喺入境處嗰度，佢哋譬如要換visa啊，或者係攞身份證嗰陣時候咧，其實都可唔可以幫我哋擺一啲即係平平機會嘅單張喺度，等佢哋係直接攞得到，就唔需要經過中介公司，或者唔會畀佢幹幹擾到咧。

213
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:55,990
咁呢啲都可能係一個做法嚟嘅。噉啊，我喺度都即係希望大家誒，即係與會嘅各位朋友都聽到啦，就希望咧就佢令佢哋多啲明白，其實係有其他嘅保障嘅。除咗刑事方面嘅保障咧，民事上面佢哋可以追討賠償嘅。咁性騷擾呢一個誒誒定義咧，大家誒希望多啲去明白同瞭解啦。

214
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:03,390
其實我哋係即係誒，如果你哋係有興趣嘅話，可以接觸我哋委員會咧，我哋係可以安排一啲講座畀大家嘅。唔該。

215
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,420
好。

216
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:20,050
我哋有邀請勞工處嘅，勞工處就誒結果畀我哋答覆就係誒勞福局代表埋，噉就阿蕭生今日代表。噉你真係代表得到先得啦，唔該主席。

217
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:27,540
好誒，唔該曬朱生，跟住請進步勞工工會嘅舒拿女士。

218
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,560
多謝，主席。

219
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:51,910
There are more than 330 migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong. We constitute almost 9% of workforce for Hong Kong economy. Although exposed cases shows that migrant domestic workers are vulnerable, the Hong Kong government refused to change their policy to avoid exploitation to migrant domestic workers.

220
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,340
嗯。

221
00:47:52,900 --> 00:48:01,980
migrant workers who had pending cases couldn't work in Hong Kong. This is why we migrant domestic workers are not willing to process a case.

222
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:22,270
一宗勞工案件需要四至六個月才完成，從向勞工處提出案件到勞工 tribunal。在這段期間，雖然我們作為內地僱員被允許在香港逗留作為遊客，我們無法賺錢。然而，我們也正在支付。

223
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:33,470
our own food, housing and basic fees. It makes us more difficult to seek for justice, as migrant domestic workers are forced to live with our employers.

224
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:45,430
we has we has we have no place to go while they are where we are forced to live in the workplace and mix more chance for us to abuse in a private household.

225
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:51,160
In fact, these immigration policies, including under the two weeks rule and force.

226
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,600
In a live-in arrangement, is discouraging migrant workers to stand for their rights.

227
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:05,590
with the unreasonable immigration policies, the excessive agency fee puts more constraints to migrant domestic workers.

228
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:13,440
As we are shouldering the death, we are dare not to speak up. Even we are facing abuse.

229
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:33,730
The Hong Kong government has responsibility to protect us migrant domestic workers. However, the lack of support and the harsh policies to migrant domestic workers not allowing them to implement their rights. The government should relax its immigration policies and clear the malpractices of employment agencies too.

230
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:40,920
另一方面，政府應該 put 更多公共支援到 migrant domestic workers， who face any type of violence。

231
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:52,600
although the government claim that the service for victims of domestic and sexual violence also serve migrant worker, the service are not accessible and not sufficient to migrant workers.

232
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,750
In fact, compared to other women, migrant workers are facing violence to have more concerns.

233
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:19,390
我哋有啲問題，嘅 visa 需要 settle 住 stay in Hong Kong，而個 case 是 pending， 以及亦都有缺乏收入，如我哋所提過，政府應該建立公眾服務，為 migrant domestic workers， 包括 shelter 及財務支援，以允許佢哋去尋求正義。喺現實中， migrant domestic

234
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:27,740
需要一個地方住，待在早產或離婚案件中，但不僅是受性或家暴的受害者。

235
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:48,030
Fadu demand the government to establish tripartite system, including workers, employers and government representatives, to discuss and formulate laws and protections to migrant domestic workers. Provide enough and accessible shelter to migrant workers who become victim of violence, or provide funding to legal union.

236
00:50:48,030 --> 00:51:01,770
在澳斯設立的服務。謝謝。謝謝。誒，跟住我哋請香港加亞洲家務工工聯會嘅鄧建華先生。係，唔該主席。

237
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:11,070
誒喺幾日之前咧，有一個政府資助嘅機構嘅社工咧，就打電話去我哋嘅辦公室。

238
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:16,080
去問一啲咧，即係關於外傭嘅誒服務嘅問題。

239
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,950
嗰陣時，我就感到好奇怪，一個社工點解佢需要去向我哋工會咧去查問呢啲嘢咧？噉樣。

240
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:33,650
細問之下咧，原來發現咧，佢哋係接到一個咧，在港嘅尼泊爾家庭傭工嘅受到強姦嘅個案。

241
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:42,100
然之後咧，其實佢根本就唔知道點樣去幫呢一位嘅外傭，所以咧就打電話嚟我哋嘅工會咧去查問。

242
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:53,580
呢個正正就顯示到咧，政府佢雖然聲稱提供咗好多唔同種類嘅服務啊，佢哋嘅社工好幫到呢啲噉樣嘅受害人啊。

243
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,750
都係一啲嘅廢話嚟。

244
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:11,390
我哋每一次開呢一啲嘅公聽會嘅時候咧，政府好多個部門咧都能夠創作到好多啊一啲政府文件啊，畀五個部門交六版紙畀立法會，就話咧已經做咗好多保障措施啊。

245
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:24,530
但係咧，你只要細心啲睇呢一份文件咧，就會發現咧，政府只不過係將提供畀本地婦女嘅服務咧，就聲稱咧，佢都係為外籍家務工嘅服務。

246
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:37,730
呢一樣嘢反而咧係更加突顯到香港政府提供呢一啲嘅所謂嘅服務嘅時候咧，冇照顧到外籍家庭傭工喺香港咧特別嗰個需要。

247
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,120
事實上咧。

248
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,960
誒，比如話誒，庇護服務噉樣。

249
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:54,120
香港本地嘅婦女如果受到家庭暴力嘅話咧，嗰啲嘅庇護服務嘅標準嘅居住期可能係得兩至三個星期。

250
00:52:54,570 --> 00:53:05,930
但係一個喺香港做嘢嘅外籍家庭傭工，如果係需要去啊去打一個官司，佢可能起碼要。

251
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:26,220
啊，數以誒半年甚至係啊幾年嘅時間咧，去處理呢個個案嘅。咁呢啲噉嘅庇護服務點可以聲稱都係可以為到家外籍家務工服務咧？所以咧，好好明顯咧，睇得到咧，香港政府而家敷衍失責，而家我哋講。

252
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:39,070
講緊一啲基本嘅權利咧，只不過講緊咧係佢哋有冇辦法實踐到喺香港嘅基本權利，而唔係咧你係寫喺啊白紙上面嘅呢一啲嘅空泛嘅言詞。

253
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:55,790
實際上咧，喺香港嘅外傭，如果要爭取一個法庭嘅公義咧，佢冇辦法喺香港工作。一個人點樣可以喺一個基本生活都保障唔到嘅情況之下，尋求所謂嘅公義咧？嚇！如果喺呢個情況之下，

254
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:16,880
香港政府仍然認為自己做得好足夠咧，我哋認為咧係完全係不可接受啊！另外咧，為咗令到僱主同僱員雙方嘅意見都得到政府嘅接納咧，我哋認為咧必須要設立一個三方嘅平台嚇，包括僱主、僱員同埋政府嘅代表去協商所有呢一啲關於外籍家庭用工嘅政策。

255
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,420
多謝主席。好，唔該曬，鄧健華。

256
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:27,080
誒，跟住請泰國義工公會嘅誒MissParichatJonathan。

257
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:47,850
大家好，誒我咧又有經驗，因為我做嗰啲泰國個工會，同埋咧我係誒做我我嗰啲誒position咧就係工人，我做到二十幾年㗎啦。誒而家咧我哋咧就係誒有泰國咧公司咧，泰國政府咧就盡。

258
00:54:47,850 --> 00:55:07,860
誒有嗰啲誒庇護所畀我哋誒，噉我哋就可以。如果啊有嗰啲想要嗰啲誒艾滋病治after treatment contact咧，我哋就可以去泰國攞嗰度幫忙。不過而家咧，我哋誒泰泰國政府嗰度咧。

259
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:27,870
就係聽左嗰啲表嫂咧，嫂姨咧，而家咧，我哋工人咧，我哋嗰啲咩咩咧，如果有問題咧，想叫嗰啲邊度知咧，佢哋就啊，根本嗰啲啊，哼講驚富咧，因為佢哋咧係啱啱嚟緊，而家如果啊，老闆炒魷魚咧，佢哋就唔識講嘢。

260
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:47,880
同埋咧，鵪鶉鷄、鴨、鵝、鵝鵲咧，就係黐黐黐、纏纏啦，就噉話，嘿嘿，彎鈣叉個雞蛋，就係彎個雞鴨鴨，把鈕望。鵪鶉咧，鴨鵲咧，嘿，鴨鵝肉蒸熟咧，鴨鵝肉蒸熟就揪佢鵲咧，把彎union啦，鵲鵲彎union，噉樣鴨咧，就揪佢鵲鴨鴨啦，噉。

261
00:55:47,880 --> 00:56:07,890
鵪鶉咧就union，咧就鵪鶉就毛印卡嘛，鰻魚咧鵪鶉咧就蕉，蕉個啲鵪鶉方咧就海細細，就舊漿絲咧就海帶蕾咧就海金方片，然後鰻魚咧呢呢個皮烏索咧就喺河邊魚，然後鵪鶉咧就喺公魚。

262
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:27,900
有時咧，嗰啲政府咧都要話：如果你喺香港咧，你都要有朋友同埋嗰啲嗰啲誒親戚啦。有時咧，嗰啲親情咧，我哋係一個人嚟香港，你就唔識邊個噉啊！所以咧，呢個誒避暑所咧就係我哋個緊要。所以今日咧，我係好多。

263
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:47,910
架個啲框框堅富咧，拆個㗎，個框呢個關衣個啲 shelter 要買幾架咧，㗎，個台個個啲公會咧，就就個啲 service form 持個啲㗎，member 啦，連啲係咩喎，緊要要呢個 shelter 啦，如果係喎緊要啦，㗎，就掙錢畀你哋啦，洗衣啦，揀揀啦，㗎。

264
00:56:47,910 --> 00:57:07,920
誒，坐嘢，個龕我悠，出列啦，係話，龕畀你哋聽話，呢個佩烏索啦，係胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟住，我哋胡，同我哋胡，跟

265
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,310
我啲幫跳嗰啲我哋嗰啲member仔姐。

266
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,630
好，唔該曬你，誒都多謝你特別抽時間出嚟。不過今日嘅邀請其實係立法會邀請你過嚟。

267
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,250
就誒，我哋同時都邀請咗政府聽你講嘢。

268
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,690
好。

269
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:44,980
跟住我哋請香港人權監察嘅羅旭啟，係多謝主席。誒，其實我哋好同意咧，好多團體誒對呢個誒內容喺香港家庭裏面誒遇到嘅暴力啊、啊性侵犯、種種嘅一啲問題嘅成因啊，同埋啲助長嘅因素。噉我哋即係覺得誒要解決啲。

270
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:55,320
問題咧啊！我哋就要誒，真係要認真去做啲功夫，包括咧誒，要同輸出國，香港政府應該同輸出國咧有其恩利。

271
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:13,150
要有雙邊嘅協議咧，啊，去有效噉樣去管制嚇來源地勞務公司嘅過失收費，禁止咧造成一個嚇誒一個誒嚴重嘅剝削嚇誒，然後咧由呢個用工咧就孭咗嚇好誒。

272
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:33,460
一個誒巨額嘅一個誒債務，咁好似賣豬仔噉樣咧，啊要用可能做成七個月啦白做噉樣去還債。咁誒，因為佢呢啲噉嘅債務咧，係誒使到佢哋咧係好難啊，即係誒可以誒即係誒有效咁去保護自己嘅。咁又好多錢為係要還。

273
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:53,470
債咧好多時要壓底，咁誒而事實上咧呢一啲噉嘅誒形式嘅債務同埋啊誒勞務嘅一種壓力咧誒係同即係國際上面而家我哋講嘅所謂販賣人口啊啊嘅定義係相符嘅，咁所以鄉政府必須要去介入其中，同埋好多呢啲。

274
00:58:53,470 --> 00:59:13,480
債務喺香港嘅財務公司係提供嘅，喺香港去簽訂嘅，喺香港嚇誒錢銀交往嘅。香港嘅啊誒財務公司啊銀行嗰啲監管機構咧，唔應該對呢啲問題咧係視而不顧啊，應該咧就誒即時去處理。咁如果我哋冇一啲咁有效。

275
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:33,490
嘅勞務管制咧啊嘅嘅一個雙方協議咧，我覺得我哋應該咧逐步同嗰啲國家咧係停止嚇誒誒輸入佢哋嘅誒用工去保障翻嚇誒，我哋唔會有呢啲現代嘅人口買賣。咁同時咧，我哋都真係需要咧啊，係有一個誒，我哋。

276
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:46,170
本身又提供嘅另外嘅服務，使到啊呢啲外傭嚟到香港係有足夠嘅網絡。其實一個人佢被剝削啊啊誒被欺凌咧，其中好重要原因佢係冇一個誒。

277
00:59:46,760 --> 01:00:06,770
有效嘅嚇網絡去保護自己，誒，亦都唔自己唔知道有關嘅知識喺噉嘅情況之下咧啊，就會係誒好容易受害。咁所以其實任誒鄉政府其實值得啊喺我哋咁大筆喺外融收取嘅費用裏面咧啊誒撥出一部分咧去設立。

278
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:26,780
啊！一啲誒嚟港嘅人士嘅外傭咧啊，譬如可能三日嘅一個入營嘅服務啊啊，由政府提供或者係由非政府最好加入都會組織去提供咁咧喺個過程裏面，三日啦，或者誒適當嘅日子裏面咧，係工會啊、服務團體啊、婦女團體啊、平機會啊、勞工。

279
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:38,470
公署啊！佢哋完全係可以講翻有關嘅知識，同埋容許佢建立有關嘅網絡，咁去保護自己。咁否則咧啊，都係即係呢啲朋友咧，都係啊任人魚肉嘅啫。多謝謝。

280
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:45,370
好，啊唔該，羅生，跟住我哋請Pathfinders嘅誒周翠珊小姐。

281
01:00:46,170 --> 01:01:05,620
主席，各位早晨啊！我係周翠珊，係Parkfinders嘅高級個案經理。Parkfinders係香港嘅註冊慈善機構，我哋咧致力確保喺香港出世嘅弱勢兒童同佢哋嘅外傭媽媽咧，得到應有嘅尊重同埋保障。直到目前為止，我哋已經協助超過二千八百名嘅兒童同佢哋嘅外傭媽媽。

282
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:24,660
喺過去三年半里邊，我哋收到咧三十一宗喺家庭之中發生嘅精神虐待、身體虐待同埋性暴力嘅個案。施虐者通常都係受害人嘅僱主啦，或者係僱主嘅屋企人。當中三宗嘅性暴力個案更加因奸成人，令受害人有咗B B。

283
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:39,910
喺同期之中咧，警方數字就顯示咗一共有四十二宗外傭被僱主非禮嘅案件，同埋十六宗外傭被僱主強姦嘅案件。我哋相信咧，呢個警方嘅數字咧都只係咧冰山嘅一角。

284
01:01:40,190 --> 01:02:00,200
喺屋企裏邊咧，如果外傭咧不幸噉樣成為咗性暴力下嘅受害者，佢哋通常喺兩種情況下聯絡我哋partners。第一種係佢哋仲同緊施虐者同一屋檐下；，另一種係已經逃離咗僱主嘅屋企，無家可歸，甚至係已經係失去咗佢哋外傭簽證嘅受害人。

285
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:04,940
佢哋因為擔心自己會有咗B B，所以嚟到Part Finders求助。

286
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:13,690
根據入境處同埋僱傭合約嘅要求，受害人咧只能夠繼續同施虐者一齊住，為嘅咧係保住份工。

287
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:21,490
當佢哋唔能夠再忍受嘅時候，佢哋就會逃走或者辭職啦。咁呢個時候，佢哋第一就失去咗收入。

288
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:34,030
第二就失去咗外傭嘅簽證，即係香港居民嘅身份。第三就係失去咗香港居民所擁有嘅福利同埋支援，例如食物銀行啦，或者產前檢查等。

289
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:39,450
第四就係喺一個異鄉之中，孤單噉樣面對一次意外嘅懷孕。

290
01:02:40,010 --> 01:03:00,020
我哋相信任何人咧都唔應該面對流離失所、貧困交迫同埋求助無門嘅痛苦。我哋建議政府第一增加宣傳教育，鼓勵外容求助同埋報案；第二增加多渠道嘅求助或者報案嘅方法，例如可以用短信SMS啦、Facebook、WhatsApp。

291
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:15,700
等等喺我哋嘅經驗裏邊咧，呢啲媒介咧有效鼓勵受助人咧去求助，即係例如喺方便佢哋夜晚啊做曬啲屋企嘢啦，又唔可以半夜三更開電話講嘢㗎嘛，噉樣咁都仲可以盡快去求助。

292
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:26,080
第四咧就係保留受害人嘅工作簽證同埋香港居民嘅身份一段時間，令受害人咧可以有空間咧去將生活咧重拾正軌。

293
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,910
被約唔係佢嘅錯，唔應該因為咁咧將佢排除喺社會之外嘅。多謝。

294
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:41,280
好，唔該曬周小姐。Next，we like to have Miss Annie Andiani，亞洲移居人士聯盟。

295
01:03:41,560 --> 01:04:01,570
謝謝，先生。委外家務工已經服務香港超過40年，我們相信我們對香港經濟和社會的貢獻是無數的，我們相信很多人都欣賞我們的存在。然而，長年來我們都受到孤立和歧視。

296
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:21,580
Unfortunately, sad enough, from the case of Erwiana to other type of cases suffering by foreign domestic workers, shows that our problem is not only bad employers, but it is bad policies. Hong Kong has been placing a lot of discriminatory policies against domestic workers, and this is the reason why more and more practices.

297
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:41,590
of exclusion and discrimination has been imposing to us not only by the government but even in our social life. The policies that we are referring is one of the force live in that make us vulnerable to in the hand of the employers, visa discrimination where we are actually tied up two weeks if ever we we get terminated.

298
01:04:41,590 --> 01:05:01,600
We must leave Hong Kong if we want to reapply another job. We are not allowed to change to another type of job. Beyond that, while we having a legal case, we must not allowed to work. Another discrimination we face is on the wage where we are excluded from the statutory minimum wage, and because of that, it is up to the Labour Department.

299
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:21,610
我們define what how much wages we receive every year. Another discrimination is standard working hours proposal. We heard that domestic workers will be surely be excluded. Another form of that is where our Hong Kong ID was put with W in the front wherever we go. Whenever they saw the W in front, they will surely exclude us from their services.

300
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:28,590
and another more service practices that I cannot mention one by one, it has impacted our life a lot.

301
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:48,930
We actually suffer very strong legalised discrimination, isolation, living in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, discrimination against domestic workers become norm and acceptable attitude of the Hong Kong society. It caused us to be more powerless in the hand of employers and the agencies. It actually in the in

302
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,480
The name of.

303
01:05:50,760 --> 01:06:10,770
enforcing mandatory leave in now there are a lot of arrest blacklisted and deported fellow domestic workers because they cut them living out. What we are demanding the Hong Kong government is not only simple reform, but beyond that, review and reform all discriminatory policies and regulation and practices against.

304
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,020
domestic workers。

305
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,480
what we mean with this is one

306
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:34,770
That should allow domestic workers to work legally. Even we have our ongoing cases. And the second is we should be included in the standard working hours proposal that will be established in Hong Kong. Beyond that, also we actually demand 4,500 wage increase this year, and we hope the Labour Department will consider. And the Labour

307
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:54,780
The Department of Hong Kong Government has been having longstanding issue of providing support for terminated domestic workers from shelter and other daily needs. Also, give us free visa extension whenever we need to extend one, and allow us also to work without any prevention of any restriction. Thank you.

308
01:06:54,970 --> 01:07:14,980
Thank you, Amy. Next, we would like to invite Ms Dolores Balderas of United Filipinos in Hong Kong. Thank you, Mr Chairman. Good morning, everyone. I'm representing the United Filipinos in Hong Kong, an alliance of 32 migrant organisations established in 1985.

309
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:27,360
作為 grassroots organisation， we believe that support for foreign domestic workers， victims or witness of violence in domestic setting is very important.

310
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:47,650
The principal reason why foreign domestic workers have no choice but to rely on charitable institutions for temporary support while pursuing their cases is the Hong Kong Immigration Department's new condition of stay or two-week rule, which prohibits domestic workers to work legally.

311
01:07:47,650 --> 01:08:07,660
while cases are going on, due to this regulation, distressed foreign domestic workers become unemployed and stay in temporary shelters for two months to one year or even longer in some instances. Whenever they pursue their cases, only after the final decision of the

312
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:11,750
court， are they allowed to find new jobs and work legally？

313
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:32,040
and coming from tried cases, even we won the case, foreign domestic workers find it hard to find an employer. and not only that, paying a lot of money to the recruitment agencies are a big problem. and because we are paying this big amount of money to the recruitment agents

314
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,840
We don't have enough money to support our own needs, like the health needs.

315
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:58,130
Generally, there is an urgent need to expand the social welfare budget of Hong Kong, so as to include all marginalised sectors in the provision of essential services and acting socially inclusive policies without augmenting the public fund.

316
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:18,140
for social services will will merely create unwarranted competition and animosity between sectors within the Hong Kong community and fund the xenophobia that already exists to some extent among the local populace. Therefore, our recommendation to the legislature

317
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:38,150
委員會 on the issue at hand may be summarised into two: one, enact policies and laws that provide financial, logistical and legal support to victims and witnesses of violence against foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong; and number two, increase Hong Kong's budgetary.

318
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:46,590
allocation for social welfare services to include all marginalised sectors of the community. Thank you.

319
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:53,710
Thank you, Ms. Baladaris。跟住我哋請，We like to invite。

320
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,790
Miss。

321
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:02,940
Screening Screening Acting of Indonesian Migrant Workers Union. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

322
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:15,310
We believe that any proposal by the government to provide social welfare coverage to distress foreign domestic worker is a step in the right direction.

323
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:29,490
和某啲應該從香港移民工計劃開始做的。外國家務工人是香港社區的一部分，並在經濟和社會中扮演不可或缺的角色。

324
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:49,780
deserving like all other members of the community, share in essential social services that are part of the mandated function of the governments. Currently, policies for social service provision for foreign domestic worker in Hong Kong lead to what discrimination and social exclusion, particularly in the area of healthcare.

325
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,970
and access to redress.

326
01:10:52,300 --> 01:11:12,310
This is especially true for victims of abuse who have filed cases against their employers, as they are automatically excluded from coverage of medical benefit in public hospitals as a time when it is most needed. The two-week rule and the consequent non-eligibility to the

327
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:21,880
Like of about further deprive them of any establish mechanism for social support that other member of the Hong Kong community currently enjoy.

328
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:42,180
The highly privatised nature of social support in Hong Kong places foreign domestic workers who at the lowest wages generally place foreign domestic worker in an economically vulnerable position. This become even more worse when they

329
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:54,730
They are displaced by the termination of their contract. Not only they cannot send money to their family back home, but they also have to find means to subsidise their personal and legal expenses.

330
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,260
and the Hong Kong government have to.

331
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:09,990
charges fee of Hong Kong dollar 190 whenever foreign domestic worker extender visa during their case in Hong Kong.

332
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:30,570
所以，我們相信提供服務給所有 marginalised 人民，特別係為家務工人，係香港政府的責任。我們要求立法會議員處理這個爭議。謝謝。

333
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:38,610
Thank you。誒，跟住或者最後，我哋請國際特赦組織嘅陳依慧小姐。

334
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:59,610
係誒，多謝主席。而家咧係啊，劉幸衞，唔該曬誒。而家咧，香港嘅三十幾萬獲批來港嘅誒外傭咧，其實只可以擔任全職留宿嘅家務工作啦。咁喺Ariana個個案咧揭發咗之後，其實政府曾經有承諾過咧，就係加強對外傭權益嘅保障嘅，而勞福局同埋勞工處咧。

335
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:19,620
亦都喺二零一五年嘅六月十六號啦，向立法會人力事務委員會委員會誒有陳述過有關政府就加強保障外傭權益嘅措施。咁其中係有三樣嘢嘅，包括加強保障外傭對自身權益嘅認識啦，加強同外傭輸出國嘅政府合作，同埋加強監管咧職業介紹所，亦都即係中介公司。

336
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:39,630
國際特赦組織香港分會認為咧，其實以上嘅建誒建議嘅措施咧，係唔足夠減低外傭喺家居環境入邊咧遭受暴力嘅風險嘅。國際特赦組織其實喺二零一三年咧就發表咗研究報告，咁記錄咗好多外傭喺香港工作嘅時候受到唔少違反人權啦同埋勞工權益嘅對待，噉。

337
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:59,640
其中研究報告指出咧，同住規定規定咧，其實係令到外傭長期置身喺高風險嘅環境啦，令到佢哋被排斥同埋孤立，增加咗佢哋被剝削同埋侵犯嘅風險嘅。而家入境處嘅住宿同埋家務安排入邊咧，要求僱主提供合適同埋有合理私隱嘅住宿地方啦。但係而家嘅法例其實冇。

338
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:19,650
就所謂合適同埋有合理私隱咧，設任何定義嘅。所以，當外傭發現佢哋自己置身於一個會受到暴力嘅風險嘅環境嘅時候咧，佢哋根本係冇任何法律依據同埋標準係提出投訴嘅。除咗呢樣嘢之外咧，誒，其中一個我哋嘅研究報告入邊嘅主人翁啦，佢係受到僱主嘅父親性侵犯啦。

339
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:39,660
多次嘅拒絕同埋阻止，不過亦都有被中介公司恐嚇而唔敢去報警求助嘅，亦都有外傭咧係因為經濟剝削同埋文化差異等等嘅原因唔夠膽舉報啦。誒，亦都有誒外傭咧係因為避免舉報咗之後咧被僱主辭退，喺兩個禮拜之內咧揾唔到新嘅僱主而需要離開香港嘅。

340
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:59,840
而家香港警察其實係冇守則啦，處理外容遭受家暴嘅誒遭受暴力嘅案件啦，亦都缺乏咧案件轉介嘅機制，亦都冇對中介公司咧發出有關處理呢一啲案件嘅指引同埋條例。根據聯合國咧取消對婦女一切形式歧視公約嘅第十一條一F咧，其實政府係有責任確保。

341
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:19,850
所有婦女喺工作環境入邊享有健康同埋安全嘅保障。其實頭先亦都有團體提過咧，誒呢一條公約嘅委員會咧喺上一年咧審視香港政府合聘定期報告嘅結論意見入邊，指出咗咧喺香港工作嘅外傭係持續受到虐待，而且明確出請香港政府咧係根據。

342
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:39,860
國際勞工組織關於家庭工人體面條誒動勞動嘅公約咧嘅各項要求，修改同住規定，令到外宿可以成為一種可誒可供選擇嘅要求。所以國際特赦組織香港分會咧，促請香港政府除咗盡快落實早前提出過嘅建議措施之外咧，亦都需要根據消除對婦女一切。

343
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:51,960
形式歧視委員會提出嘅意見，為喺家居環境入邊遭受暴力嘅外傭提供有效嘅支援同埋保障，包括修訂而家強迫外傭同誒僱主同住嘅法例。多謝主席。

344
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,580
好，唔該曬，劉允維小姐。

345
01:15:54,860 --> 01:16:14,150
誒，好多謝今日咁多有關注到，即係外傭喺呢個工作同埋家居嘅環境度受虐，包括咗嘅暴力同埋或者係精神同埋性方面嘅虐待嘅問題。咁今日個組，即係咁多位組織，其實都相當有代表性。

346
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:18,920
噉我哋講緊係即係香港三十幾萬嘅外籍傭工。

347
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:26,880
誒裏邊的確係發生咗唔少嘅被虐嘅問題，而外籍員工，我哋喺一個權力鏈度咧。

348
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:37,910
好明顯，佢哋都係一個最弱勢嘅情況。噉我哋亦都係講緊，即係處理緊佢哋而家被虐待嘅問題，所以喺。

349
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:46,400
誒呢啲用工被虐待嘅問題咧，我要清楚指出咧，係冇持平或者唔持平可言。

350
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,260
我哋要尋求公義。

351
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:59,550
咁所以，我哋即係我希望剩翻落嚟嘅時間，我哋都唔係好多，大概三十幾分鐘都唔夠四十分鐘。我哋真係要好好把握時間。咁

352
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:19,840
誒政府當然，我係希望你誒誒盡量回應翻頭先團體提到嘅問題。但係，我覺得有誒相當嘅政策嘅問題，譬如話，可能係包括咗嗰兩個星期嘅即係要離境啊、誒標準工時啊，或者啲相對比較係有關外籍用工嘅政策咧。

353
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:40,360
誒，我希望政府儘量簡短啦，因為裏邊都牽涉到直情係一啲比較具體發生呢啲暴力事件嘅時候，誒，譬如話部門之間嘅協調啦，一啲實際嘅援助啦，包括咗誒庇護啦，誒一啲基本嘅生活嘅支援啦。

354
01:17:40,360 --> 01:18:00,370
勞工處喺呢方面嗰個角色咧，以致到入境處同警方之間嗰個協調咧，我希望誒部門之間係可以畀一啲具體嘅回應，就唔好久前喺一啲即係我哋講多十年都可能唔會變嘅政策之上。咁之後，我會交個時間畀同事嘅係首先。

355
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:20,380
先請副局長。係誒，好多嘅主席先誒，我亦都喺呢度，即係呢個機會，好多謝各位團體，剛才畀咗即係唔少好具體而且有用嘅意見，特別係可能係關於點樣我哋可以加強呢個支援同埋協調個方面嘅意見。誒，正如你主席所講咧，我都唔想話即係因為整體嗰個即係誒關於。

356
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:40,390
外傭嗰個勞工政策喺上個月亦都喺呢個人力事務委員會傾過，亦都可以繼續喺嗰度傾。咁反而我想針對特別針對關於真係外傭遭受到暴力或者性暴力嘅情況之下嗰方面嘅情況咧，我都作出一啲回應先。咁至於一啲具體嘅運作咧，我都可以就係請一陣我哋部門嘅同事。

357
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,450
做一啲補充。

358
01:18:41,810 --> 01:19:01,820
誒，首先咧，我都即係誒睇到咧，大家最關注第一點咧，就係話當一個實好實際嘅情況，就係當個外傭去舉報嗰個僱主嘅時間咧，當然佢好快就面對一個問題，就係話可能佢嘅僱傭合約會停咗，跟住咧佢要面對居住嘅問題，甚至可能日常生活嘅問題。

359
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:21,830
跟住咧就可能嗰個居留嗰個問題，咁事實上咧之前我都特別就住咧誒，即係今次嘅委員委員會嘅時候咧，都睇過大家以前曾經提出嘅問題，以及咧我都即係探訪過，即係例如好似方宇亮啊、阿阿黃黃秀容女士啊，或者其他指約員啊噉樣，同埋睇過呢個佢哋就曾經做過一個報告。

360
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:41,840
做關於呢方面嘅工作，噉我都特別即係再同我哋啲部門啲同事即係澄清翻、講清翻嗱。第一點咧，我先想即係講翻就係嗰個逗留嘅時間嗱。如果其實正如喺我哋文件所講咧，即係如果個內容係向呢個警方去報案，其實即係喺個調查期間咧，據我理解咧就係。

361
01:19:41,840 --> 01:20:01,850
話警方已經可以啫通知翻呢個入警處，咁而入警處通常咧都會咧就係會，如果係遇到呢啲情況咧，都會咧就係酌情咧就係畀佢哋咧延長嗰個居留嘅呢個第一點，即係變咗居留嗰度咧，佢哋都會因應佢，因為佢要留喺誒度做喺呢個司法嘅程序裏邊做。

362
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:21,860
證人噉，所以咧佢哋會畀佢延長嘅居留。第二點當然就係牽涉到頭先大家都聽到就話，即係誒可唔可以揾其他僱主喺中中誒其其中嘅停服，甚至我都聽到有啲即係誒團體講咧誒，可能需要即係完曬個司法程序咧誒先至可以揾。咁但係我頭先都特登再即係同啊入境處嘅同事。

363
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:41,870
即係再澄清翻咧，其實就係話咧，入境處同事咧就係可以亦都因應翻個實際嘅情況，特別有一啲即係如其中個原因咧，當然就係包括咧，如果嗰個外遊曾經遭受呢個苛待啊等等或者剝削嘅情況咧，佢哋都會咧或者其他因素嘅理由咧，佢哋都可以酌情批准佢咧，係喺香港轉顧。

364
01:20:41,870 --> 01:21:01,880
户主而唔需要翻返原居地嘅，亦都係話咧，唔需一定話等個司法程序完咗。佢主要係呢方面有證據可以顯示到佢有呢方面嘅問題嘅時間咧，入境處都可以喺呢方面咧畀到佢呢方面嘅準許。咁所以咧變咗，如果一般嚟講咧，就話如果個佢真係。

365
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:21,890
第一樣，佢可以逗留喺度咧。如果係個程序比較長嘅時間，佢當然可以揾即係其他僱主咧。另一方面，當然亦都有啲人選擇翻咗去即係誒誒呢個誒原居地咧。咁而如果真係日後咧，真係需要警方需要佢哋喺原居地翻嚟做證人嘅時間，而律政司亦都認為咧，嗰個證人係需。

366
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:28,690
需要嘅時間咧，咁當然即係政府嗰方面亦都會負責佢，無論係機票啊、交通費用等等呢方面工作。

367
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:48,980
咁當然，正正就係咁咧，就係所以，我哋誒而家我哋社福利處畀個支援咧，就話如果真係有需要嘅時間，我哋都即係預期就話，當然中間個過渡時期，無論佢係即係誒轉去另一個即係誒僱主，又或者係誒翻返原居地，中間嗰啲過渡時期咧，咁點解我哋就係會畀一個所謂誒呢個？

368
01:21:48,980 --> 01:22:08,990
庇護嘅服務畀佢，包括紙藥丸啊，甚至其他庇護中心都可以畀佢。咁當然啦，雖然係話即係誒兩個星期，原則上係兩個星期，但係都可以咧靈活去處理，去因應個實際嘅情況去處理。咁所以咧都，但係都我都聽到有啲即係誒團體都講，原來有啲都係繼續保留喺度嘅。噉我哋都好樂意咧，就係即係。

369
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:29,000
進一步理解每個個案嘅情況，睇下我哋呢個服務裏邊咧喺邊度仲可以加強喺度，即係再誒聽取大家嘅意見。咁至於第二點咧，就係話咧誒，大家都有有團體都講到嗰個留宿嗰個政策，噉我都真係誒，當然啦，如果詳細講個講嗰個政策咧，噉我當然可以喺呢個歷史無限月嗰度。

370
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:49,010
傾噉，但係都想即係好簡短地回應咧。大家都知道嗰個留宿嘅政策咧，其實都喺一九七零年嗰陣時，其實都係因應翻咧誒本地嘅勞工咧喺呢個所謂留宿嘅誒用工個短缺，先至會引入呢個外用。咁所以咧要留宿呢個規定咧，其實係一個整個政策嗰個基。

371
01:22:49,010 --> 01:23:09,020
基石嚟嘅，咁所以如果你即係話取消咗呢樣嘢嘅時間咧，其實就係同呢個政策背道而馳嘅。因為始終都係咧，我哋同其他嘅地區一樣，我哋嘅政策都係始終都係讓本地嘅勞工咧優先就業嘅。但係如果你改變咗呢個流縮呢度咧，其實都影響到整個個勞工嘅政策。咁同埋當然咧，當亦都會考慮到做。

372
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:29,030
話會唔會即係關於僱主嗰個承擔能力啊？又或者嗰個其實就係都會額外造成香港無論係住屋啊，或者係交通方面嘅額外負荷等等呢啲全情況咧。咁所以我都同意有有部分嘅團體或者朋友講咧，佢就話其實最重要，我諗幫到啲咧就係真係要讓佢哋能夠即係啲內容好清咗佢哋嘅權。

373
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:49,040
權益同埋好清楚知道咧，佢哋可以即係去誒投訴或者去報案嘅渠道。咁所以呢方面咧，我哋都即係過去無論係勞工處、入境處以及呢個即係社會福利處咧誒嘅主要人員等等咧，都係希望可以透過咧就係唔同嘅誒語文，都係用翻內容用。

374
01:23:49,040 --> 01:24:09,050
翻嘅母語嘅語文咧，去喺呢方面加強嘅宣傳。咁當然包括咧，就話誒透過啲非政府機構，淨係喺機場就向新來港嗰啲工作嘅外傭，即係派發啲宣傳包啦。又或者咧，直接去到咧就係好多時外傭誒，即係嘅好多時休息日嘅時間，去聚居嘅地方，直接喺嗰度咧播放好多宣傳片，同埋畀。

375
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:29,060
好多資訊包佢哋喺當中裏邊咧，資訊裏邊咧都係講翻佢哋嘅權益。特別係喺呢近年嚟講咧，我哋都特別講翻咧，佢喺呢方面如果遭受到苛待或者剝削或者虐待呢方面嘅情況咧，佢哋投訴嗰個渠道喺呢方面咧，我哋都會繼續喺呢方面加強，甚至咧我哋都係即係同誒。

376
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:49,070
誒加強咧，同嗰個誒即係誒領事領領事館合作，直情喺佢哋嘅簡介會或者啲文化活動裏邊咧，都會做呢方面嘅推廣。咁同埋咧，亦都喺咧本港一啲即係主要嘅誒菲律賓文啊，或者呢個印尼文嘅報章裏邊咧，將呢啲信息去帶出嚟。咁當然啦，我哋即係誒，正如頭先所講，都話喺。

377
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:54,030
邊方面可以加強呢方面咧？噉我哋都會即係盡力喺呢方面做嘅。

378
01:24:54,310 --> 01:25:14,320
咁至於頭先都講到咧，就係關於嗰個即係誒資助園裏邊嘅提供嗰個，除咗住宿之外咧，其實佢哋都可以咧向佢哋提供，譬如佢嚟講一啲即係誒超級市場券啊，或者如果有需要嘅時間咧，都會幫佢哋申請一啲慈善基金同埋啲食物嘅援助。咁但係當然呢個係始終個個性質咧都。

379
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:34,330
都係一個短期，唔係一個長期性，因為都預期咧就話誒呢個僑工咧，佢可能喺即係揾到另一份工，或者已經翻咗去呢個即係原居地等等。咁呢個服務就唔係話咧係一個長期嘅住屋安排。咁但係當然喺邊方面仍然都係有即係地方需要加強咧。噉我哋都樂意繼續同即係大家商討，同埋睇下邊方面誒大家嘅意見。

380
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:46,370
有啲具體意見畀我哋嘅，或者我回應到呢度先。我哋都畀少少期時間，即係其他我哋嘅同事，即係睇下會唔會就住佢哋嘅具體運作同埋啲問題嘅有啲補充。好啊，誒有冇其他部門要回應？

381
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,890
社署有冇馮生？

382
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,750
冇，誒。

383
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,060
入境。

384
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,570
冇進一步回應。

385
01:25:56,210 --> 01:26:03,610
誒入境嗰度咧，就頭先都有提到，就係即係嗰個入境嗰個誒。

386
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:06,120
誒Visa嗰個嘅。

387
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:26,410
批核咧，往往都繼續要即係畀即係內容要付費嘅，同埋誒，頭先亦都講緊入境處同誒勞工處之間嗰個嘅誒聯係，似乎冇一個直接嘅，即係呢個個案出咗誒出現咗，或者警方亦都同勞工。

388
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:41,170
處冇一個直接嘅聯繫，即係警方收到個個案咧，未必即刻通知勞工處，以致到佢可以幫佢收，或者入警處回應咗嗰個你哋個誒有關呢啲visa或者其他嗰個誒延續呢visa嘅問題。

389
01:26:41,450 --> 01:27:01,460
好，多謝主席。其實我哋已經係一個公開嘅政策嚟嘅，就如果假如外傭咧係有證據顯示佢曾經喺香港誒受到僱主嘅苛待或者剝削，噉佢係同我哋咧申請咧，第一一係就延期居留，一係就轉換佢嘅僱主。如果佢揾到僱主嘅時候咧，通常我哋就會要求佢出示一啲證據，其實證據就。

390
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:21,470
唔買一啲好複雜嘅證據，佢只要同我哋咧提供一啲，譬如佢咧一啲報案嘅誒誒誒報案紙啦，或者報案號碼啦。咁其實基本上咧，喺每一單嘅個案裏邊咧，警方嘅個案主管同我哋個案主任咧都會有一個密切嘅聯繫嘅。咁喺個處理申請嘅過程裏邊咧，如果假如佢係能夠揾到僱主嘅。

391
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:41,480
我就容許佢喺香港轉屋，而唔需要離開香港嘅。咁嗰個誒辦理咧，就其實我哋唔會當一般嘅個案處理嘅。每一單呢類噉嘅新案咧，我都特別個案處理。咁當然啦，個嗰個精神咧，盡快咁去誒批核嗰個誒申請啦。咁如果假如喺個期間裏邊，佢揾唔到僱主，而又需要留喺香港。

392
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:59,230
嘅，我哋會係畀一個延期逗留畀佢嘅。而家如果係一個訪客嘅延期留申請咧，嗰個簽證費用我哋係豁免嘅。嚇，咁所以每一單個案其實裏邊咧，我哋都會同無論警方好、勞工團體好，或者係誒勞工處好，我哋都有緊緊密嘅溝通嘅。多謝主席。

393
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:14,810
好明白，噉啊，阿羅生，咁即係你哋有冇有關嘅指引？因為頭先阿蕭副局長就提到，即係你哋係可以容許佢誒轉換僱主啦，繼續工作啦，同埋甚至唔需要返翻原居地。

394
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:27,760
咁呢啲有冇一定嘅指引咧？都係主席有嘅。其實誒，除咗內部指引之外咧，其實呢度哋喺度公開政策喺我哋網頁咧，或者喺一啲誒宣傳單張裏邊咧，都係已經清晰咁列明咗呢一個噉嘅政策。

395
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:48,460
即係基於乜嘢條件，你哋會考慮呢啲延長啊，以致到轉換僱主同埋即係需唔需要返回原居地呢？啲係其實係講咗嘅，即係如果假如你係受到苛待或者係受到剝削，咁只要你係話到畀我聽嘅情況，噉我哋就會誒誒根據嘅情況去處理，而且亦都唔需要好自證話曾經有個誒。

396
01:28:48,460 --> 01:29:08,470
代表講話啊，需要向我哋啲同事重新再講一次佢嗰個聲稱係唔需要，因為呢個係由嗰個個案誒嗰個調查方面咧係進行，我哋係唔會干涉嗰個調查嗰個過程。多謝好，好，羅生噉我哋聽咗你講，因為我哋聽睇睇個現實係咪噉樣？警方有冇回應警方？

397
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:28,620
誒，其實頭先阿蕭副局長都講得好清楚㗎啦。喺誒警方處理呢啲噉樣嘅案件個個時間咧，除咗我哋要蒐集證據啊，同埋即係做一個深入嘅調查之外咧，我哋對於嗰個受害人嗰個嘅福利、其他嗰啲佢哋關注事項咧，我

398
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:48,630
我哋都非常之重視嘅。噉我哋誒其實咧喺接誒獲呢啲噉嘅案件之後咧，其實我哋都案件主管啊會主動咧係誒同嗰個入境處嗰度聯絡嘅，通知佢哋咧呢啲受害人咧牽涉喺而家呢個案件嗰度做一個受害係受害人嘅身。

399
01:29:48,630 --> 01:30:08,640
身份就誒要求咧，即係入境處畀佢哋可以延長喺香港嗰個逗留啊，噉樣。噉啊，因為有陣時調查嗰個期間啊，同埋咧審訊嗰個排期咧，需要時間嘅。噉啊，喺呢個期間裏邊咧，其實如果嗰個受害人咧係即係自己想。

400
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:28,650
翻去自己嘅國家噉樣咧，其實佢係可以嘅。咁當嗰個審訊有個誒日期出咗嚟之後咧，其實只要我哋得到即係律政司嗰個誒肯定呢個係必須嘅證人咧，其實我哋可以安排佢即係誒畀機票佢來回機票，佢翻嚟香港。

401
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:45,620
做證啦，咁喺誒香港期間咧，亦都可以安排佢喺酒店住宿啦。亦都有誒每日有一啲零用錢啦。如果佢係有工作嘅咧，其實佢有啲工作誒方面損失咗啲誒人工嗰啲嘅補償，我哋都可以安排嚟噉樣做嘅。

402
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,110
好誒，蔡生，頭先有幾個團體都提到。

403
01:30:50,390 --> 01:31:10,400
即係報案嘅誒，都呢個第初階嗰度，如果受到一啲即係警方係冇一個敏感度嘅處理，即係往往將佢變成一啲一般嘅勞資糾紛，或者唔正式咁處理呢啲。

404
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:28,370
啲有關嘅投訴，講緊係其實有刑事成分嘅暴力或者性暴力事件，呢個係會對呢啲外籍僗工一個相當大嘅打擊。呢部分即係喺警方嘅培訓啊，你哋點樣處理呢啲投訴嘅時候，你哋有冇咩回應？

405
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:36,450
即係誒，其實我哋警方咧對呢啲誒處理呢啲暴力嘅案件。

406
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:42,160
誒嘅專業性啦，同埋嗰個敏感度咧，都係非常之重視嘅。

407
01:31:42,440 --> 01:32:02,450
咁其實喺我哋誒唔各個唔同家誒嘅層面嘅訓練嗰度咧，都會有包含一啲呢啲噉嘅敏感度啊、誒專業性嘅嗰個訓練嘅，即係例如喺我哋而家嗰個誒學警嘅基本訓練啦，同埋我哋嗰個督察級嗰個基本訓練嗰度咧，都包括咗。

408
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:22,460
呢幾方面嗰啲誒嘅訓練嘅元素喺度嘅，噉我可以舉啲例子咧，就例如咧係一啲誒處理性暴力案件嗰個培訓啦、罪行受害者嗰個約章啦、誒處理受害人嗰啲心理技巧啦、同理心聆聽啦、衝突管理啦。

409
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:40,930
暴力行為同埋處理嘅方法啊等等嘅嘅課題咧，都會包含喺嗰度。咁另外咧，其實咧，誒喺一二零一二年之後咧，其實我哋都有定期邀請咗平等機會委員會嗰度咧，嚟喺我哋一啲嗰啲誒。

410
01:32:41,210 --> 01:33:01,220
誒課程嗰度咧嚟到做一啲誒講解啊，同埋分享嘅，主要都係即係提高我哋前線同事咧喺呢一方面嗰個敏感度啊噉樣嘅。係蔡生講緊係誒對外籍員工嗰個情況，即係唔係講緊一般嘅性暴力或者係一啲嘅罪行受。

411
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:07,450
或者藥障有冇喺呢部分喺即係你哋警員嘅培訓裏邊有注重咧？

412
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:28,670
誒，其實如果係針淨係針對呢個外籍僱工嘅咧，我哋冇一個好即係特別嘅培訓喺呢一方面嚟去做嘅。但係頭先我講嗰啲即係嘅培訓嗰方面咧，其實如果我哋即係應用得好嘅咧，好多都係可以即係適當噉樣嚟去用得到嘅。

413
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:49,520
好噉，我加翻啲時間畀同事先。我哋誒要誒，我諗要行四分鐘。我讀局嘅誒個名次咧，劉慧卿、陳遠賢、陳志全、何俊仁。咁首先請阿劉慧卿係誒，唔該主席誒，噉啊，多謝咁多位團體嚟畀意見我哋啦。咁主席，因為隔籬房咧又講緊有一樣。

414
01:33:49,520 --> 01:34:09,530
我提出嘅議題，講喺呢個政府嗰度請誒誒嗰個少數族裔，所以咧我問完要走過去睇睇先。噉就誒呢個問題咧，我哋今日傾嘅咧，就係非常之複雜啦。好似我頭先講咧，我真係好憤怒呢個勞工處唔嚟，而頭先嗰啲答案嗰陣時咧，主席佢都冇答。

415
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:29,540
到誒呢個平機會講誒，佢嚟到機場啊，畀一大沓文件啊、法律啊，畀啲外用噉樣嗰個嗰啲中介公司有啲啊，劈咗佢嚇。噉啊，我相信平機會又唔會講大話啦。老實講，你就算畀曬佢啊，佢都未必識睇啲香港啲法律。咁所以我真係覺得呢個你畀佢哋，令到佢知道。

416
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:49,550
佢權利嗰樣嘢係好唔足夠噉，當然我好高興自由黨阿李生喺度。其實我都希望嗰啲外傭僱主啊，佢都可以嚟出席嗱。我哋立法會咧係保障外傭，亦都保障僱主，所有人喺香港人嘅權益嘅。咁所以如果話僱主有投訴，外傭有投，

417
01:34:49,550 --> 01:35:09,560
訴都應該有個機制，主席係好公平公正咁去處理。而家聽起上嚟就係冇咩冇呢個機制啊嘛，所以我頭先好同意阿鄧健華先生講，即係有個三方平台嚇，僱用、僱主、政府或者畀啲誒其他嗰啲誒非政府組織，大家坐埋一齊，有咩事要去處理。

418
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:21,410
而佢哋面對嘅問題唔係普通香港啊婦女或者遇到嘅家暴啊嘛，因為佢係弱勢。頭先有啲個都講啦，一係你就要公義，一係你要食飯。

419
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:41,700
咁點搞咧？咁呢個頭先講咗嗰啲嘢啊，真係未必係可以針對到外籍家庭傭工面對嘅問題啊！嘛，主席。咁所以我唔知你老人家陣間點樣總結啦嚇，即係聽完曬咁多嘢。但係我覺得佢哋三十幾萬人喺度，你大家都同意，佢哋對香港。

420
01:35:41,700 --> 01:36:01,710
係作出好重要嘅貢獻，咁自由黨都實同意啦。如果冇咗佢哋，邊個人出去做咁多嘢咧？嚇，對香港經濟發展係有咩影響咧？咁但係佢哋自己嘅國家，啊羅啓講得好啱啦，亦都有問題嚟到為咗新債，嚇護照都收埋，喂。

421
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:21,720
你嗰啲中介公司做咗咩㗎？有啲話去同個中介公司講，又畀人恐嚇添。噉你真係噉，你勞工處嚇入警處，警方做咗啲乜嘢去保障佢哋咧？一班咁弱勢嘅人離鄉別井，冇曬家庭嚟到香港，出咗事係得到咩保障？有啲就話：，誒，其實我聽。

422
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:41,730
亞洲應好過嘅其他㗎啦，嗬噉樣唔係一個好自豪嘅嘢咯。如果個樓棟出咗好多窿，所以主席，唉，我都唔識問啦，即係咁多問題，即係實在即係嗱，我就好慶勞工處唔喺度，因為我覺得要去規管嗰啲中介公司咧係好重要一環嚟嘅，因為佢哋有。

423
01:36:41,730 --> 01:37:01,740
咩事？佢多數就揾嗰啲中介公司㗎嘛。你嗰啲熱線人係廿日廿四小時，又識唔識講佢啲話咧？即係你要畀人哋求助有門先得㗎。噉啊，副局你答下啦。如果真係有一個人遇到噉嘅困難，佢揾佢揾邊度係可以有人好有效即刻幫到佢咧？好。

424
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:21,750
局長，或者即係我都喺呢度都誒再補充翻啦，因為事實上咧就係關於嗰個即係啊，關於內容同埋特別係點樣即係加強監管嗰個即係誒呢個職業介紹所、嗰個中介公司等等咧，其實喺上個月喺呢個人力事務委員會裏邊咧都有討論嘅，有一場嘅討論。咁當然啦，誒有需要嘅時間。

425
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:41,760
都可以繼續喺度去討論。噉我都特別就針對頭先即係阿劉興議員嗰個關注咧。第一點咧就係話誒，所以點解正正我哋頭先就話喂佢會唔會即係我哋嘅宣傳嘅渠道咧？即係唔係單止係一一點，而係包括除咗話佢嚟到機場，我哋會同佢宣傳嘅時間咧，我哋都希都去埋佢哋一啲即係。

426
01:37:41,760 --> 01:38:01,770
平時即係聚居嘅地方，或者呢個電視、電電個宣傳片，甚至去到呢個同呢個領事館一齊咧合作呢個活動。咁希望可以咧直接可以將呢個信息咧畀我哋嘅同事。咁至於關於嗰個即係職業介紹所咧，正如頭先都有團體都講過咧，其實我哋都希望喺你加強呢邊個嘢咧，我哋做緊嗰個實務嘅守則，我哋預期喺下。

427
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:21,780
下半年裏邊咧，就可以拎個草擬本拎出嚟公眾諮詢。當然咧，個團體都可以喺呢方面，無論係僱主或者僱員，都喺呢方面畀呢個意見。而另一方面咧，勞工處亦都喺今年裏邊咧加強咗嗰個巡查，咁亦都咧就係由以前每年即係一千三百次咧，去到一千八百次。咁而我都睇翻咧過去咧，亦都曾經咧都檢。

428
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:33,790
控嗰啲嘅即係職業介紹所，包括咧，譬如攬收佣金啊，或者等等各方面嘅問題。咁喺呢方面，我哋都希望可以喺呢方面加強呢方面嘅工作。嗯，係會唔會即係做一個三方平台？

429
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:38,310
就住，譬如話呢個指引，讓僱主僱員。

430
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:58,930
同埋政府，大家坐低去傾一傾。誒，我哋呢個誒指引裏，呢個呢個指引裏邊咧，其實就會拎出嚟公眾諮詢。咁當然咧，無論係僱主僱員咧，係我哋都係會即係誒邀請大家發表意見。咁至於嗰個形式方面咧，咁稍後嘅時間我都聽咗大家嘅意見。咁至於點樣更加有效地去聽取到大家嘅意見咧，咁呢方面。

431
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:18,940
我哋都會將向我哋勞工處嘅同事反映翻。好，陳宇涵議員，實在就唔使咁複雜啦。今勞工處處長應該坐樹，兄姐講啱㗎，因為冇應該坐樹啊。我應該坐樹啊，因為咧老實講嗱，佢上次嚟講到外籍用工嘅問題咧，就當時處長跟埋局長一齊嚟嘅。

432
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:38,950
佢哋匿喺局長後邊，即係經常就冇開始講具體嘢。噉我自己覺得咧，實質係勞工處處長今日要嚟，佢負責㗎嘛。好多中介公司都佢負責㗎嘛。好多佢存在問題，佢都佢負責啊嘛。點解今日唔嚟咧，主席？係我哋唔請佢，還是我哋請佢？請咗，請咗，佢唔嚟。噉佢有冇道理解釋咧？誒，佢話消庫局代表埋。喂，我想講啊！

433
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:51,190
譴責佢啊！我真係覺得要我譴責，因為佢具體負責㗎嘛佢，即係呢件事啊，成件事就唔係副局代替到佢嘛。如果唔係，使乜上組個勞工處處長嘅職位啫？係咪？我覺得呢個係離譜嘅情況嚟嘅。

434
01:39:51,500 --> 01:40:00,610
另外，首先好多謝咁多團體今日嚟講，特別一啲本身係外籍員工嘅朋友嚟咧，我覺得對我哋一直關心呢件事嘅人咧，係一個好大幫助嘅。

435
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:14,160
誒我自己認為咧，誒我好同意羅繼替講嘅，即係而家佢哋嚟到度都係一個幾個狀況幾幾困難，我哋唔好畀佢感覺到香港好似係個奴役人嘅地方。

436
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:34,480
喺呢個地方裏邊，當佢有事嘅時候咧，佢完全冇地方可以投訴。咁所以，我覺得而家我哋我我諗，我哋今日呢個會就唔係第一次開。即係當出現咗個個案嘅時候，我哋已經開專責會，開咗誒一個幾次會啦。之後又逢親啲問題，我哋都開嘅。即係你你發覺每一次都好似剛才副局長噉樣咧，乜翻啲牀。

437
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:54,490
重複又重複，重複重複係解決唔到問題。咁所以，我對於而家政府又當務之急咧，令到一批噉嘅長期喺誒海外做嘢，你諗佢哋都幾淒涼啊！即係唔好意思啊，即係為咗為咗養家離開屋企嚟到香港，我諗你個人當中就我哋呢啲覺得最真。

438
01:40:54,490 --> 01:41:14,500
係應該從呢個角度講，係係一一方面，你哋好好難得為咗家庭嚟到海外；但另一方面咧，當佢有事嘅時候咧，即係冇人幫佢哋嗰種淒涼咧，我哋真係好有感受。咁所以我就覺得，嗱，除咗剛才主席講，你將個指引有三分一平台一定要做嘅副阿副局長。另外，我就想話而家。

439
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:34,510
啲幫手嗰啲NGO咧，其實都可以試下同佢做埋㗎連結嘅，即係例如好似風雨蘭啊，例如我哋啲係誒關注性暴力嘅協會等等咧，其實呢啲你好似黃秀容啲都係好資深嘅社工嚟㗎嘛，即係你可以同啲平台裡面多啲連結，直接掛鈎，就等佢哋有事就可以揾啲團體，就唔使嚟到呢度。

440
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:46,530
就估都唔知點算嗱。上次個案，如果唔係嗰啲嗰啲同鄉揭發佢咧，香港都唔知揭發先先知。如果假如冇，你話點算咧？即係佢哋講，佢都唔知邊揾人。

441
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:53,110
只你話中介公司，我哋鬧咗好多次啦。你基本上成個政府就冇管理嘅中介公司嘅。

442
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:55,380
唔係正式嘅公司。

443
01:41:55,660 --> 01:42:15,670
即係唔係當我哋政府批出嚟公司，主席我講咗好耐㗎啦。你仍然繼續上次局長嚟講咧，其實繼續佢可以做嘅。噉我覺得有時我都莫名其妙啲嘢嘅。咁所以變咗噉嘅情況下咧，嗱，誒副局長第一個咧，將我哋今日不滿勞工處處長嗰樣講出嚟啦。佢冇可能唔嚟嘅，佢冇可能。你亦都唔能夠再講我代表。

444
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:20,480
到佢，你代表到唔唔到佢？如果代表到佢，何需個有個勞工處處長啫？

445
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:40,880
第二個咧，我想講咧，就喺呢個過程當中，我覺得指引嘅雙三方平台重要嘅。第二個喺啲過渡期，當我哋未有成套嘢出嘅時候咧，我就覺得係咪相關嘅而家啲誒團體咧，你哋應該同我續有平台，亦都作為佢哋去投訴噉嘅地方。喂，好難得呢個NGO佢哋幫你手。

446
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,290
第三個，我想講咧，平機會係你嘅，你嘅。

447
01:42:45,700 --> 01:43:05,710
雖然話佢係一個獨立嘅機構，但係係政府好有關係㗎嘛。因為佢嘅宣傳品去唔到啲地方，你都唔知熟是無睹啫。即係我覺得呢樣嘢，我覺得都係一個好難理解啊。即係呢啲我唔相信平基會先今日講嘅，你哋應該一定情況同政府反映到，你哋嘢去唔到一啲外籍員工手上嘅。除非你話唔係。

448
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:06,080
係。

449
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:26,370
我哋誒冇，我哋當呢啲嘢冇發生，除非係噉嘅啫。如果唔係，我覺得難以理解。主席，三問題佢答唔到，我哋論一論佢。不如我佢隔離開開個會先，間下，因為今日有另一個會隔離。我噉樣啦，誒一陣再即係。佢而家答我組，而家答我。嗱，你盡快啦，如果阿。三問題啊。係盡快。我我即係。

450
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:46,380
阿阿陳誒陳議員所講嘅嘢，當然係一定係我哋要同即係大家加強嗰個溝通同合作。咁呢方面咧，我相信無論喺誒日常嗰個運作同埋將來一陣嗰個指引裏邊咧，點樣更加有效地聽取到大家嘅意見，同埋令到個意見咧更加具體同補實咧。咁呢方面當然即係我哋都一定會即係聽到頭先陳議員嘅意見噉。

451
01:43:46,380 --> 01:44:06,390
咁同埋加強，咁事實上即係誒，正如好似頭先我都講啦，譬如好似誒，我都去過即係譬如風雨難，咁亦都定正就係阿阿阿黃女士畀咗好多好寶貴嘅意見，同埋好具體嘅情況，讓我哋更加瞭解情況先去同有關嘅部門嚟跟進。咁呢方面我哋都會繼續做呢方面嘅工作。主席，我想唔係跟進啊，係經過評。

452
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:26,400
台啊！當你未有任何嘢嘅時候，我唔想我哋一年前講嘅嘢，而家都仍然噉嘅狀況啊！所以我就希望咧，係咪政府係要同一啲NGO要建立一個平台，就話如果將來所有啲外籍員工當你受到任何欺凌嘅時候咧，或者有啲意見話咧，你可以去相關團體，包括如果僱主你都認為有事咪開工。

453
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:46,410
香港一個好公平嘅社會，同樣可以去一啲平台去投呢啲投訴。咁所以，我覺得就話你你而家件事，我哋唔好繼續咁發展落去咧。如果再有第二、第三、第四喺國際上影響對香港都極端，即係畀人感覺我哋呢個專係奴役外地嘅勞工一個地方咧。咁對香港嚟講，一個好大好大損。

454
01:44:46,410 --> 01:45:06,420
我希望即係局長、副局長去講啦。另外真係好希望你將意見帶翻去畀誒老誒呢個勞工處處長。我覺得今日咁唔嚟咧，誒我就極端唔同意嘅，因為佢本身係負責嘅一個主嘅主要嘅部門嚟㗎嘛。唔該，主席。好，唔該啊，陳遠恆。跟住請阿陳志全。多謝主席。

455
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:15,190
首先多謝咧，今日十八個單位嘅朋友上到嚟發表意見啦。其實未聽團體意見，我哋都知道香港對於外籍，

456
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:21,800
家庭用工嘅保障係非常之不足。咁今朝聽完咧，就簡直係慘不忍睹。

457
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:42,090
主席，頭先你就畀咗機會，即係各個政府部門去回應啦。咁勞工處缺席，當然我哋非常不滿啦。其實入境處同埋警務處嘅答覆咧，我都係即係佢哋冇主動去回應問題，我都係有啲不滿。其實我哋講緊呢個問題，除咗睇嗰個誒法制，即係個法例個機制。

458
01:45:42,090 --> 01:46:02,100
嚇，仲要睇下咧，究竟個機制係能唔能夠畀佢哋知道？佢哋知道之後係咪放心？係咪喺一個安全嘅環境裏邊可以用呢個機制？咁頭先我聽到誒呢個入境處同埋警務處都係，即係佢畀我感覺就係係啦，已。

459
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:09,190
已經有一個誒機制啊，行之有效嘅機制，誒有個健全機制喺度噉樣。

460
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:29,500
咁而家我哋就話畀你聽，喂，唔係喎，你嗰個所謂嘅機制唔係行之有效，有時有喺度又發揮唔到作用，有時有喺度，但係啲外資僱工遇到問題唔敢用喎。噉你點樣去令到你個機制真係發揮嗰個效力咧？譬如頭先問警務處，啊，佢就係話又係講嗰啲指引啊。

461
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:49,510
培訓啦，但係譬如有啲朋友話，因為個溝通問題，啲警員去到嗰個屋企嗰度就會即係用息事寧人嘅態度，係叫佢哋誒，即係當一個勞資嘅糾紛，噉就即係可能講幾句噉就走咗去。咁呢啲係即係對，即係啲團體提出嚟嘅問題。咁譬如我就要問。

462
01:46:49,510 --> 01:47:09,520
啦，警務處，你有冇啲記錄啊？係遇到呢啲噉嘅情況，外傭同僱主即係即時嘅一個報案，上到嚟溝通有問題，係咪啲警員會即時call誒傳譯嚟幫手咧？有冇呢啲數字記錄喺度咧？譬如入境處嗰個問題就係你又係話啦，有呢個機制喺文件嘅。

463
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:29,530
十六段你就話有證據顯示，如果外傭曾經遭到苛待剝削，咁入境處可以酌情批准畀佢哋喺香港轉換僱主，而無需先返回內地或誒原居地。呢個就係有一個好大嘅問題，就係好多外傭係擔心一投訴一搞大件事就要翻鄉下，就冇咗份工噉。

464
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:42,670
入境處有冇啲數字可以提供翻畀我哋咧？究竟呢個機制嘅運作成點咧？成功嘅機會大唔大咧？啊，中間會遇到啲咩困難咧？譬如佢要轉換僱主，佢要幾耐？

465
01:47:42,960 --> 01:48:02,970
之間要轉換到，如果轉換唔到，你哋話免費畀佢訪客簽證繼續居留喺度，咁呢段時間佢又冇咗嗰個，即係佢唔可以工作，噉佢可唔可以繼續揾工、繼續揾僱主，跟住個僱主即係揾到又變翻呢個簽翻嗰個僱傭合約，又變翻傭工咧？啊，我畀少少時間政府回應。

466
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:06,910
好啊，或者入境處講先咧，即係有冇有關嘅數字咧？

467
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:27,920
係，多謝主席。誒，如果你話根據話投訴人，因為投訴之後申請而我哋批嘅數字咧，暫時我哋冇嘅，我哋冇保存，因為咧，其實每個個案咧，我哋係誒獨立咁去去處理誒跟進。咁因為喺每一個個案裏邊咧，如果假如嗰個誒外資員工，佢係揾到僱主嘅，噉。

468
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:47,930
我哋係根據一般嘅程序噉啊，當然我哋會加快處理啦。咁如果假如佢揾唔到嘅，唔等於咧就係話佢唔可以繼續揾嘅。噉我哋會以一個旅客身份畀佢繼續逗留先。咁喺個逗留期間，我就講過啦，係唔需要收佢簽證費嘅。只要佢一旦去揾到僱主，而揾到僱主嗰啲證明文件畀到我哋嘅，我哋係會根據嗰個誒。

469
01:48:47,930 --> 01:49:07,940
誒安排就盡快幫佢處理嚇。多謝主席。主席，我係覺得冇可能係冇統計數字嘅，即係你話每個係個別嘅事件，但係因為受到僱主苛待或者剝削而提出呢一個誒要求啊嘛，轉僱主又好，繼續逗留又好，噉佢個個案嚟咗你度，你先至去裁。

470
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:27,180
決㗎嘛？咁可唔可以翻去做翻呢啲數字畀我哋？因為呢數字點解重要咧？就係要畀到啲外資員工睇，喂個成功率都好高㗎，你哋放心，唔係嚟到咧誒係係好個別嘅著情，真係多數翻鄉下㗎。如果大部分都係可以繼續留喺香港，咁會令到鼓勵佢哋遇到即係苛待嘅時候會舉報咯。

471
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:47,470
羅生或者誒，可唔可以畀翻即係會後啦？我相信你而家未必有啦。就係譬即係譬如過去呢幾年誒，有幾多嘅外籍僱工係投訴呢個誒受到暴力或者性暴力嘅案件？咁呢啲嘅投訴嘅個案裏邊誒有幾？

472
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:58,890
幾多係返回原居地嘅？有幾多咧？就係可以繼續留喺香港嘅，就用一個旅客身份繼續留留喺度，留誒留咗有幾長？

473
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:03,350
咁呢啲嘅情況，我諗你都應該會。

474
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:23,640
有資料嘅係嘛，羅生誒。最後我哋翻嚟整理下，由我就誒誒畀翻誒。好，唔該曬，羅生。好，跟住誒，或者我因為剩翻五分鐘咧，我誒仲我哋仲有三位同事喺度。如果大家同事唔反對咧，我哋就延展到去十二點。

475
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:43,650
十五分嚇，延長十五分鐘呢個會議。噉我哋希望即係團體有機會反映翻個情況，因為頭先我哋聽到入境處同埋警務處咧講到係誒相當理想嘅，即係連誒機票啊咩嚟到佢嗰個喺當地工作嗰個損失都。

476
01:50:43,650 --> 01:51:03,660
會補償翻啊，剩啊噉樣噉，我哋睇下個現實係咪咁理想係。我哋跟住請阿何俊仁議員，之後就張國柱同埋鄧家彪開張人誒。主席，我再次當多謝今日出席嘅團體同代表啦嚇。就誒，我都係想跟進翻正話所講嗰啲誒誒。

477
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:17,920
個案嘅處理啦，即係問題。依家今日嚟到提出誒誒質誒質詢嘅咧，一有啲係政策嘅問題，有啲就係政策落實嘅問題。噉我先講第二點先啦，即係你落實咧政策。

478
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:38,580
好多時候咧，就係出現嘅問題咩嘢咧？就係當我哋話喂個政策唔公平噉樣，譬如話兩個誒有人投訴，但係咧你可能兩個月嚟要佢走，跟住咧誒兩個禮拜之內要佢走，跟住咧就話誒佢留喺度可能又冇冇呢個誒能力可以誒獨立生活。

479
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:58,690
又可能又唔畀佢揾工等等嘅嘢，即係又冇時間揾工等等嘅嘢。咁咧，通常政府嘅答案咧，一遇到呢對噉嘅噉嘅誒指控嘅時候咧，佢話我哋有酌情權嘅噉就，我哋會合理去到處理。咁如果牽涉到噉嘅時候咧，你係兩樣嘢。第一，你點行使你嘅酌情權？噉我哋一定會想知道咧，你有冇啲內部嘅指引？

480
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:18,890
尤其是咧，有陣時會出現咧，就係有有爭論。佢譬如僱主出嚟話：，喂，唔係呢個僱員咧，可能就係誒誒講嘅嘢完全唔符合事實喎。佢係想轉工啫喎，實際上高冇啲噉嘅情況喎，噉樣。一遇到噉嘅情況，你點處理咧？噉樣會唔會好？有啲人會好容易傾向。

481
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:29,200
就誒僱主啱喎，誒我我可能覺得佢有説服力噉就，咁咁所以問題就係誒會可能造成一一啲個案係被屈。

482
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:44,650
或者咧，外邊睇你唔知你點樣公平地去到處理，尤其是牽涉到一啲弱勢嘅羣體嗰個一啲嘅要求。噉我所以，我我想第一咧就係問下你哋有冇啲比較具仔具體啲嘅指引點樣處理？第二咧。

483
01:52:45,040 --> 01:53:00,650
就係我哋所攞個數字，就係唔淨止話有幾多個案，你係行使嗰張證券，係畀佢留耐啲嘅時間，畀佢揾工等等，而係就係有幾多噉嘅投訴裏邊有幾多係成功。

484
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:14,640
即係我要我要作一個噉樣嘅誒數字嘅分析，先就可以可以可以知道啦。咁呢個第一個問題啦，一個大嘅問題。第二，我我簡單咧講一講咧，就係依家好多問題出現於咧，就係嗰啲中介公司嘅操守。

485
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:30,210
咁咧就牽涉到好多可能係不公平嘅合約啊，裏邊嘅誒包括到即係好收好高嘅費用。我知道表面上高係有話，即係有有有有好多國家咧有規定嗰個收費，但係實際上高。

486
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:48,070
然即係係咪噉樣咧？會唔會佢額外收費？如果遇到呢啲噉嘅投訴，你哋係點樣處理咧？遇到一啲中介公司，佢又又啲係跨境嘅操作，你遇到幾多又點樣去到去到處理？成功嘅個案點樣？你哋有冇辦點樣嘅處分？

487
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:58,800
好，咁呢？我先兩個先，好冇？好好誒，首先或者警方講講你哋個內部有冇指引先，即係處理呢啲外籍僗工嗰個有關呢方面嘅投訴。

488
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:02,230
啊，財神。

489
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:10,410
我哋又冇即係正式一個誒，關於處理呢個呢方面問題嘅一個指引嘅。

490
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:18,800
但係就即係我哋有好多處理唔同個案、唔同誒種類嘅案件嘅情嘅情況咧，都會有另外一啲。

491
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:22,740
案件性嘅指引，但係你話即係淨係針對。

492
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:26,800
外資用工呢方面嗰啲咧，就冇一個噉樣嘅指引。

493
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:32,350
即係起碼一點，正話啲同事都關心嘅就係，如果有人嚟投訴。

494
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:43,930
就係話，譬如受到受到性侵犯或者咩嘢啦，或者虐待噉樣啦，咁好多時候最大嘅問題就係語言溝通嘅問題。你哋會唔會首先確保係有適當嘅傳譯員？

495
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:51,910
同埋咧就係起碼即係誒揾個安心嘅地方，誒畀佢嚟到嚟到嚟到落落落口供等等。啊，好，蔡生。

496
01:54:52,430 --> 01:55:12,440
誒，其實咧，如果即係涉及一啲誒報案人或者受害人咧，係一啲外籍人士嘅咧，我哋嘅嘅嘅即係有好清晰嘅指引，就一定咧係要透過一啲傳譯員嚟同佢錄取口供嘅。噉啊，呢啲傳譯員咧，即係嗰個翻譯嗰個語言咧，係嗰個事主即係話一個受害。

497
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:32,450
人佢自己本身嗰個母語啦，或者佢選擇嗰個即係愛嚟做溝通嘅語言嚟去做嘅啲傳譯員咧，即係我哋亦都有既定嘅程序咧，係點樣去即係要求佢哋嚟嚟到去警署嗰度做啊？噉樣噉你話，如果涉及一啲誒性罪行嗰方面嘅受害人咧，其實。

498
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:42,370
即係我哋都個敏感度非常之高嘅。你話要去誒會見佢啊，成噉樣咧，定係要一個好即係有私隱嘅地方嚟到去噉樣進行嘅？

499
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:49,130
咁有冇即係啲傳譯員有冇有關嘅訓練，尤其是即係處理性暴力個案嘅？

500
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:55,160
嗱，因為嗰啲傳疫源咧，其實咧就係即係係誒。

501
01:55:55,640 --> 01:56:03,540
司法即係我哋嘅司法機關嗰邊嘅，佢哋係隸屬，即係佢哋嗰個誒。

502
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:16,150
個工作嗰個要求啊，個水準啊，全部都係即係司法機關嗰度定落嚟嘅。所以你話提供誒訓練畀傳譯員咧，我哋即係警方咧就冇做到呢一方面嘅工作嘅。

503
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:36,530
明白，或者噉啊，啊何俊盈議員，即係我哋睇下仲有冇啲時間再跟進，因為你之前即係跟住講嗰啲數字咧，可能我哋再誒除咗你講話幾多個個案之外咧，就係幾多成功，即係喺經過個司法程序成功定罪嘅個案。噉我。

504
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:37,470
我諗可能。

505
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:57,760
誒都請阿副局即係統籌埋呢方面嘅數字，好嘛？嗯，好唔唔係唔係成功嘅定罪，而係佢成功攞到酌情酌情權，攞到酌情嚇，攞攞譬如話畀佢明白好啊，好啊，好跟住誒張國柱誒，多謝主主席，咁亦都多謝今日十幾位嘅朋。

506
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:17,770
有嚟呢度表達意見，我覺得即係今日冇勞工處嘅代表喺度咧，即係聽唔曬，又聽唔到啦。即係上次人力嘅基人力事務委員會就冇人嚟表達意見㗎嘛，佢根本人我我哋認識嘅根本冇十幾位代表咁清楚啦，係咪？

507
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:18,760
咁所以今日。

508
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:26,940
即係勞工處冇同事嚟咧，我即係應該表示遺憾。我希望啊副局睇答唔答到我以下啲問題啦。

509
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:42,950
誒，我估成件事發生咧，無論係即係誒外用，可能係被虐待、誒性侵犯或者係誒暴力等等，或者係佢哋。

510
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:44,290
誒。

511
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:56,940
對僱主嘅細路仔咧係誒處理不當，因為我我我都收過一個短片咧，係將個幾個月大嘅B B拋嚟拋去。

512
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:00,060
噉，我覺得呢度係誒。

513
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,740
中介公司係難辭其咎。

514
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,550
即係佢係。

515
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:14,490
即係呢個誒誒作為中介咧，去引入外用，佢應該有清晰嘅指引，或者係訓練。

516
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:20,580
話畀啲外傭聽，佢應該邊啲做得，邊啲唔做得，邊啲佢需要防範。

517
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:22,890
嗱，呢啲冚棒，我覺得。

518
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:28,680
誒可能副局一陣會話畀我哋聽，喺實務手則嗰度，我哋會照顧㗎啦噉。

519
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:34,920
咁但係，誒整體中介公司嗰個行為，你有冇一啲？

520
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:51,310
誒唔係唔係實務守則咁簡單，又係你要有個處罰嘅制度，甚至乎唔係吊銷佢嘅執照，分分鐘係要坐監。呢啲冚唪唥，我覺得係要有一個誒比較全面啲嘅。

521
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:57,530
誒話畀我哋聽，令到啲中介者咧係唔敢亂嚟。

522
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:59,290
雖然即係今日。

523
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:05,400
即係冇勞工處啦。嗱，另外一樣嘢咧，就係都要追一追數嘅。

524
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:14,900
即係上次局長咧就提到咧，就為嗰啲新來港嘅第一次嚟嗰啲啦嚇嘅外傭咧，係提供課程。

525
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,850
有關佢哋嗰個權益啊，等等嗰啲噉。

526
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:27,560
噉係要八個星期內咧，佢嚟到香港咧就要提供。噉我唔知而家執行成點，可能都未喐嘅。

527
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:31,220
啊！即係我哋正話追實物手錶都追唔到啦，係嘛？

528
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:51,510
噉我諗第三個問題咧，就係剛才副局就提到個實務守則同個三方平台咧係有關㗎嘛。但係佢就話誒，整我整咗條實務守則噉啊，即係諮詢噉啊，即係三方平台都知㗎啦。咁即係用用啲噉嘅角度去處理個問題。但係我自己就覺得點解你唔？

529
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:55,040
去喺擬定個實務守則之前。

530
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:58,260
去同三方平台咧傾一次。

531
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:18,860
出嚟就好符合大家嘅諗法㗎啦。如果唔係咧，就大家同你講餐死，你又礙於即係你個位置或者政府唔可以衝擊嘅，所以我我係唔改啊。咁噉啊，對著幹就無謂啦。噉你先前可唔可以喺個執行指引做嘅？

532
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:19,620
時候。

533
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:36,610
之前你要去同三方平台傾一次咧噉，最後一樣我想即係警方答一答嘅就係剛才提到A君，即係誒佢應該係受聘於香港，但係去咗深圳做嘢。如果即係有事嘅時候，係咪完全？

534
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:56,980
係冇得保障嘅咧嚇。唔該，主席。好誒，好多條問題誒，或者阿消副局，你首先處理。或者我首先即係回應翻頭先誒，將各處議員關於個職業介紹所嗰方面嘅規管嘅情況咧。咁頭先講第一點咧，就係或者我一句咧講講咧，就係話嗰個誒草案嗰個實務守則咧，正正就係。

535
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:16,990
個拎出嚟下半年拎出嚟嗰個，即係個草擬本嚟嘅啫。其實正正就喺個即係透過嗰個草擬本嗰個公眾諮詢咧，更加可以咧就係聽取到無論係僱主同埋僱員咧誒各方面嘅意見。咁當中嗰個具體嗰個諮詢嘅形式啊，各方面啲嘢咧，正如今日大都聽到大各位議員同埋即係。

536
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:37,000
誒嘅意見嘅時間咧，當然我都會即係將呢個帶翻畀勞工處喺佢哋即係諮詢嘅過程裏邊，點樣可以無論喺僱主僱員以及誒包括即係一啲即係非政府機構裏邊嘅意見同埋得到反映，同埋更加有效噉樣即係讓佢哋有個平台有個互動咧。咁呢方面，我當然我都會畀翻勞工處去去。

537
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:57,010
誒佢哋做翻呢樣嘢。咁至於頭先都講咧，就係話誒，正正就係話咧班加強嗰個對呢個誒新來港嗰啲，佢哋要了解佢哋嘅權益同埋投訴渠道咧。誒正正就係我哋誒同呢個誒領事館個方面緊密合作。其實就係同佢哋一新來港嘅時間咧，同佢哋喺無論喺佢哋嘅一啲。

538
02:01:57,010 --> 02:02:10,780
啲所謂誒workshop或者一啲嘅誒簡介會裏邊，又或者甚至佢哋活動裏邊咧，睇下點樣可以加強落去咧。尤其係啲新來講嗰啲，等佢可以咧有直接嘅渠道可以知道呢方面權益。咁呢方面當然我哋都會繼續喺呢方面做嘅。

539
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:12,520
好，鄧家彪。

540
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:34,190
多謝主席。誒，有三方嘅面嘅問題啊。首先多謝各個團體啦。當然誒，我知道有啲團體又有另外啲意見嘅，但係整體就係啊，保障外即係外用，亦都有啲係想保障僱主啊。因為咧，其實就算新聞嚟睇咧，固然有啲外外用嗰個誒情況喺嚟，即係。

541
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:54,200
令人同情，甚至都質疑點解香港會有啲噉嘅僱主，但係亦都有啲個案係最後僱主其實係清白噉。但係我諗咧，誒雙方都大家都覺得係需要檢討個制度，所以咧你廿二點裡面咧誒誒，全個嘅內容包括人力panel，我聽唔到你哋係想就住外用嘅中介咧。

542
02:02:54,200 --> 02:03:00,300
要建立另一個發牌制度或者係扣分制度，呢個我哋好遺憾，我哋覺都覺得好迫切。

543
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:20,590
外傭又好，僱主又好，雙方都覺得要做。我唔明點解你哋唔做？譬如你廿二點裡面講，政府並無規定外傭必須經由職業介紹所聘用，好似個意思就係話，其實咧，就算我規管或者進一步規管嗰個中介公司都冇用嘅，因為可以自由替約。當然，我即係唔同。

544
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:23,740
嘅國家有唔同嘅做法，我所知印尼。

545
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:44,110
佢即使你話佢可以自由簽約，但係未必嘅嗰個國家係唔畀嘅，一定要委託啲所謂指定嘅中介公司。當然，後背後有啲乜嘢唔講啦。但係即係其實你噉樣講係冇用嘅，因為事實上唔係我哋真係你咁寫咧，就可以係即係撇甩中介公司嗰個咁巨大嘅影。

546
02:03:44,110 --> 02:04:04,120
影響力噉，所以我唔明點解你哋唔喺呢對方面入手去保障嗰個僱主同埋咧外用嘅權益。我覺得係好有問題嘅呢個。第二咧就係話誒第十七點就係話，當外用咧係誒有誒糾紛誒獲安排出席勞審處。

547
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:14,410
即係勞資審裁處嘅聆訊咧，可以考慮咧延長佢嘅誒，即係居留啊，即係超過十四天。嗱，但係我所理解嘅情景就係。

548
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:34,700
就唔好話外勞，一個香港打工仔往往都係結束咗個僱用關係，先至去勞工處投訴。勞工處即時投訴，我當個主任唔耍佢，都係三個禮拜之後調解。調解調解失敗，先至再排一個月去勞審處落案。

549
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:52,500
我想問三個禮拜加四個禮拜七個禮拜，如果十四日點樣去做到出席和安排出席有關勞審處嘅聆訊咧？再加上可能有啲嘅外用佢語言嘅能力同可能嗰個勞工主任接收有差距，啊根本就。

550
02:04:52,780 --> 02:05:12,790
最後落唔到岸，安排唔到一個嘅即係之後嘅調解。咁所以，我覺得呢個差距係好巨大嘅。如果你話我我可以畀你嘅，只要你獲得勞審處聆訊，但係唔好意思，佢頭三個禮拜之後佢要走啦。佢根本未上到去勞審處，去勞工處先啫。呢度你哋可唔可能再睇睇咧？最後一個咧就係。

551
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:32,730
嗯，有團體講，誒有好多咧外傭咧，或者係開始有外傭咧，結束咗僱關係之後咧，就係申請僱傭申請去繼續留港。實際個情況同數字係點咧？誒呢度有冇一啲啟示？係咪真係佢哋會翻到去會受到僱傭，定係有另一啲嘢諗㗎？

552
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:53,300
啊，消保局。誒，或者我就係就頭先嗰個職業介紹所嗰度作出回應，其他關於嗰啲事，我請啊入境處嘅同事係作出回應啦。噉我首先咧都誒再正正要再強調翻咧，其實當然咧喺我哋香港呢邊咧，的確係冇規定咧，外傭必須經由呢個職業介紹所聘用。咁正如頭先啊鄧議員所所。

553
02:05:53,300 --> 02:06:13,310
提出咧，即係是否即係規定喺即係要經過嗰個國家自己嘅職業介紹所認可嘅，先至可以出嚟即係打工咧？咁呢個的確係誒即係有關國家個法例同規定嘅。咁呢方面咧，喺過去嚟講，我哋都誒一路都有嘗試向有關嘅領事館同。

554
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:33,320
同埋有關咧嘅國家嘅建議去取消有關嘅決定，噉就當然咧，始終我哋都要尊重翻咧呢個係嗰個輸出國佢哋嘅法規同埋規定。唔好意思啊，我知時間唔夠，即係我好快回應。既然你哋都覺得好似有問題，希望嗰個國家，我講印尼啦，係取消呢個規定，即係證明你都覺得有問題啦。

555
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:53,330
啊！既然你哋又唔可能駕馭到一個國家嘅決定，點解你哋唔做好本地嘅執法，或者係修改個法例去處理個中介公司咧？誒喺本地嘅執法裏邊，正如劉叔叔講咧，其實我哋亦都係已經咧，譬如誒，舉個例講，我哋個法例規定就能已經係唔能夠去濫收呢個佣金喺呢方面咧。

556
02:06:53,430 --> 02:07:13,440
其實我哋過去亦都能曾經檢控過有關嘅即係大超所。好，我諗時間唔夠啦，唔好意思，鄧家彪，我哋仲有阿劉偉興第二輪噉啊，同埋真係希望啲團體都有機會講講嘅。劉偉興，喂，兩分鐘。係啊，多謝主席嗱。我就聽聞咧，入境處咧。

557
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,680
係會擺多啲人手去處理啲投訴嘅。

558
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:37,230
因為有陣時係僱員，有陣時係僱主嘅問題，咁所以未改例乜都未做之前咧，我希望咧勞工處都可以係放多啲人手。而我最近立法會問咗條問題咧，好多投訴嘅，最終得幾單得處理嘅咋？又話啲人又投又收翻啲投訴啊，又揾唔到證據。

559
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:57,240
啊！由呢由路噉，你睇到大家係咁驚嘅咁多嘢，你要去協助㗎嘛？我希望會後咧，即係你呢個你盡快可以做得到嘅，即係幾多投訴嚟到，你真係揾人坐低揾埋呢個翻譯去睇下係邊邊嘅公公道道去處理，畀啲信心人哋願意係嚟投訴啊嘛！

560
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:17,250
啊！如果唔係投完數，發現都冇冇興趣嘅，咁咪收翻曬咯。噉我哋點可以建立好嘅制度咧？同埋同嗰啲外國政府啊，我希望你同佢講多啲啦。即係當然你唔可以幫佢立法，但係我哋都提出我哋嘅要求嘅規矩，同埋喺咩喺本地度做咯，喺本。

561
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:37,260
本地去管嗰啲中介公司咯，噉我同意啊，主席或者聽聽我啲團體嘅意見啦。好啊，誒就住頭先政府嘅講法，有冇係誒或者真係要限住啦？咁誒最多好誒三位咧，每人一分鐘啊。首先請黃秀容。係誒，其實我都覺得好贊成有個平台啦，特別即係同翻NGO即係聯。

562
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:57,270
因為頭先原來我而家先知誒，即係原來係有機制嘅，並且咧即係係係又可以申請到嗰個簽證咧，可以找僱主啦噉樣。但係我覺得個機制其實誒，即係想同大家講，其實真係好堅離地啦個機制，同埋咧根本係個門檻好高啊！即係喺我哋落實嘅時候，你就話個別個案處理噉，我哋即係就算係。

563
02:08:57,270 --> 02:09:17,280
喺我哋即係嘅，Wing Lily收到個案咧，其實都係要我哋自己去睇到佢。佢要自己去畀錢啦，去揾僱主嘅時候根本就係揾唔即係到去揾到僱主去問，即係Immigration嘅時候，結果咧都係等幾個月啦嚇。咁甚至即係誒有多係即係佢哋佢哋係完全又即係喺屋企，即係結果就係都係喺度hea。

564
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:37,290
咁所以我就想講，其實即係呢一個位咧喺個落實嗰度根本就係落實唔到咯。咁呢個係即係我希望即係呢個唔知，如果我哋其實我哋NGO就呢度眾多NGO，我諗我哋自己都自己absorbed咗好多錢啦，即係要幫嗰個受害人要交呢啲嘅即係Visa嘅費用啊，或者甚至誒其他費用。

565
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:54,890
咁同埋我諗個trust fund即係我覺得而家你都係一次過㗎嘛，其實佢哋如果係留港一年甚至係年半成，其實佢每個月都要生活費。咁而家係冇呢啲trust fund嘅噉樣，咁希望你哋都可以即係回應下呢啲問題。好，誒跟住請誒Cynthia Tellus。

566
02:09:56,270 --> 02:10:16,280
Hello, yes, thank you. I would like to add to what she was saying because as an example, before Ariana was Kartika and Kartika's employers were imprisoned. However, from then until now, that was two thousand and twelve, she has not gotten any cent. She was able to win a five thousand.

567
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:36,290
Hong Kong dollar from the labour tribunal for a 27 months work, so I don't think there's a there's a that is not made known to the people. She's she doesn't know about it. So and then I would like to go back to what about why do domestic workers just a response want to go.

568
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:56,300
home，because they lose their visa status. Even if immigration department gives them a a visitor's visa in Hong Kong, they maintain their status as a worker. But when they leave Hong Kong, they are they already lose that. So that when they are when the case is over and she can find an employer, she again has to go.

569
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:16,310
find an employer and be able should be paying another set of you know fees and then also I would like to the shortage of live in the policy in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy by the immigration department I think that has to be reviewed because even before two thousand and three when this was imposed.

570
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:36,320
In 2002，Caritas made a research and they found out that it's not really those who are staying out that's a problem. In 2002，there was 1000 position for local domestic workers but no takers. When the idea of live-in be more strict was being thought about.

571
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:50,670
And then for the domestic for the recruitment agencies, yes, there were like four out of 27 that was prosecuted last year. And what was the fine? Four thousand, three thousand.

572
02:11:51,150 --> 02:12:07,080
thank you好啊，thank you，先生，我諗誒唔好意思啊，團體代表誒，我哋其實過咗鍾，噉我真係做主席處理得唔咁唔係咁好啊，誒，我要總結啦，我哋即係今日個誒成個會議咧。

573
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:27,770
誒多謝團體講咗好多有關你哋面對嘅情況，誒亦都幾好具體講咗誒一啲嘅內容。面對呢啲家暴或者係性暴力嘅時間咧，佢哋無論係即係嗰個移民嘅居留嘅。

574
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:47,780
身份啦，佢哋誒攞唔到一啲適當嘅援助啦，包括咗庇護啦，一啲基本生活啦，以致到即係整個誒外容嘅政策本身咧，對佢哋喺呢啲噉嘅情況底下，即係家暴同性暴力底下係處於一個非常之弱。

575
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:56,050
勢同埋不利嘅情況咧，我哋聽到噉，當然自由黨亦都有提到，即係僱主呢方面嘅關注，噉。

576
02:12:56,330 --> 02:13:01,470
我哋今日咧就聽唔到有解決到啲咩問題。

577
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:17,050
誒，我哋聽到政府講咧，就樣樣都處理到，誒有啲有指引，有啲冇，不過已經有啲行之有效嘅方法。噉，但係我哋聽到團體反映嘅現實咧，就並非如此。

578
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:29,100
亦都暫時睇唔到政府有即係願意建立一啲誒平台，即係常設嘅平台去跟進有關嘅問題。

579
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:31,710
噉我希望咧，即係。

580
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:35,520
至低限度，政府用一個開放嘅態度。

581
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:55,920
嚟緊，我都希望能夠政府咧就住今日同埋即係今今日出席嘅部門啦，同埋勞工處咧，其實係應該同誒今日在席嘅或者其餘有啲未嚟到嘅團體咧，最低限度都傾一次一個內部嘅。

582
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:15,930
嘅自己嘅溝通，即係正如頭先，誒阿黃秀容講，即係誒呢個風雨難呢邊，佢哋連你哋有即係入境處有呢個噉嘅機制都未聽過，佢哋處理咗咁多個案，但係都唔清楚，即係大家要坐低傾呢一樣嘢咧，係好需要。

583
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:29,510
即係似乎大家睇到嘅現實咧，都係好唔同。咁既然N.G.O.，我哋相信佢哋誒，即係一路都喺度講緊道理，基於好多嘅實際嘅工作經驗。

584
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:39,530
政府部門咧，你哋嘅政策，你哋政策嘅落實咧，亦都係應該係去幫到呢啲受害者嘅。

585
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:46,360
噉我我覺得你哋應該係去聽一聽，詳細去聽一聽NGO佢哋嘅經驗。

586
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:58,460
噉我希望啊，消護局你能夠即係喺呢度做一個統籌，去讓呢一個溝通啊，肢體行動呢個溝通可以發生。

587
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:18,930
即係我都唔期望你哋有啲咩即時嘅改變，但係如果你話即係溝通都做唔到咧，我覺得呢個係實在難以置信。三十幾萬嘅外傭，對於我哋香港三十幾萬嘅家庭，對於我哋嘅誒無論社會經濟各方面。

588
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:22,980
嘅影響非常之巨大，而呢班外傭亦都係人。

589
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:43,270
佢哋嚟到，佢哋面對嘅困難，佢哋嘅需要，我哋亦都要以一個文明、先進嘅社會嘅方式去處理。咁所以我希望咧，字體行動今日嗰個結論咧，即係消庫局，你可以願意去同有關呢啲嘅團體去溝通。

590
02:15:43,270 --> 02:16:03,280
啊，消腐局，你有冇回應啊？多咗意見啊！我哋會喺呢方面去跟進。好咁誒，同時誒，我哋呢個會就要喺度完啦。咁但係，如果有關一啲嘅誒之後嘅問題咧，如果我哋呢個小組委員會能夠再跟進嘅話，我哋都會。

591
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:23,290
即係進一步跟進嘅咁呢個會，誒時間表咧就誒應該去到今年嘅十二月。噉我要再睇一睇，即係呢啲嘅議題係唔係已經得到充分嘅討論。咁嚟緊咧，我哋十月會再開會，我哋應該都會處理一啲有關少數族。

592
02:16:23,290 --> 02:16:43,300
瑞面對家庭暴力同埋性暴力嘅事件，咁同今日嗰個有關一啲即係語言方面咧，都都係誒有有一定嘅重疊。咁希望即係到時我哋再可以跟進呢個傳譯啊、語言文化適當嘅情況。好，今日就到此。

593
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,610
以為止啊！多謝大家。
