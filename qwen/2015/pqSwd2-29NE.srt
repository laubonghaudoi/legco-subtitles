啊，噉。

30
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:26,600
事不宜遲啦，我諗我就請啊第一個啊代表團體獅子山學會嘅誒Jensen Feng誒講一講你意見該啊。

31
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:47,090
主席，關於提出的修訂內地税收法案，聯邦研究院反對香港政府將任何在香港居住人士的個人資料提供給任何外國國度，超出我們的全面雙重税收協定所要求的範圍。我們應該看到。

32
00:05:47,200 --> 00:06:02,440
that the purpose of exchange of information is designed for foreign bureaucracies to find and tax more, so that governments and their politicians can possess more money and therefore justify their increasing and if global asset prices are right, imprudent government spending.

33
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:22,910
它用來是西方文明講授世界道德的量，重要的人權，隱私對政府的幹擾。而現在，從財政的浪費，他們像乞丐一樣嘗試從政府，例如我們，不光彩地強迫我們。

34
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,680
成為 unwilling spies of the people within our own borders.

35
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:42,870
years ago, these old world Western civilisations planted wine-producing grapevines all around the world. They've also planted the vines of respect of privacy, fiscal discipline and the spirit of liberty across the world as well.

36
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,530
now let me remind you all, members of the Legislative Council.

37
00:06:47,980 --> 00:07:06,010
that these virtues of enlightenment have taken root and flourished within our fellow Hong Kong citizens. We all know that phylloxera blighted the great vines of the old world, and it was carefully protected. It was the carefully protected vines surviving in the new world transplanted back that eventually saved the old world.

38
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:17,580
fiscal profligacy today is doing what Phalocrat did in the past. It is our duty to protect and uphold these virtues that has taken roots and flourished here by voting no on this bill.

39
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:27,610
所以當那日來臨，我們準備將私隱、財政節約和自由的藤蔓，還給那些給予他們的。

40
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:48,180
一票，今天將會作為一個醒報，給外國政府施壓我們的，税收不會拯救他們自己從自己的浪費，我們今天投票不作為一個對手的政治願望，但作為一個朋友，感謝這裡學到的啟蒙的美德，和希望。

41
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,660
佢哋會再學一day。

42
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,120
謝謝，主席。

43
00:07:51,850 --> 00:08:11,860
啊，thank you，Miss張。嗯，第二位嘅係香港中小型企業聯合會嘅會長郭振邦先生。郭先生，唔該，係多謝主席。誒，我哋香港中小型企業聯合會咧係支持各項協助推動香港整體經濟發展嘅政策同埋措施。我哋亦都明白到咧，經濟合作與發展組織。

44
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:31,870
税務透明化同埋有效交換資料全球論壇咧係一個國際認可同埋喺個高度認受性嘅組織。香港作為佢其中一位成員咧，係實在有必要喺税務政策上面咧係同國際接軌嘅。誒，因為呢一個舉動咧係可以優化現行全面性、避免雙重徵税協定嘅資料交換安排。

45
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:52,010
而且更加係符合國際嘅標準。我哋都要明白到咧，若個修訂未能獲獲得通過咧，香港有機會係唔可以係通過第二階段嘅相互評估，更有機會被視為咧係唔合作嘅税務管轄區，有損香港國際聲譽，可能削弱香港喺國際商業同埋國國際金融中心嘅。

46
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,240
地位同埋競爭力。

47
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:13,610
但係咧，我哋認為通過條例草案呢個修訂嘅時候咧，我哋應該盡量去剔除各方面公眾人士對於條例草案各方面嘅疑慮，特別包括喺平衡修訂條例同埋納税人私隱同埋交換資料保密性嘅事方面嘅時候咧，係需要係到納税人係作出法律嘅保障並。

48
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:30,170
且係必須要保障資料咧，係唔會披露任何有關於貿易業務、工業、商業等等秘密或者係貿易程序等等嘅資料。我哋會再進一步咧，就係同會員嗰方面徵詢意見，又再做一部資料嘅時候咧，會提交畀主席閣下參考嘅。多謝。

49
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:38,690
好唔該曬，唔該曬。第三位係香港金融業貿易委員會主席David O'Riordan，Mr O'Riordan，please。

50
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,650
Thank you very much. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce is pleased to have this opportunity to address this bill's committee.

51
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,730
《On Tax Information Exchange Agreement Amendments》

52
00:09:50,080 --> 00:10:05,290
我們 recognise that there is an inexorable push in the international arena towards a higher degree of tax transparency， and that Hong Kong is only slowly moving to provide statutory backing to TIES。

53
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,920
We also note that there is a risk of being labelled as an uncooperative jurisdiction.

54
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:20,550
which could be used as a pretext by other jurisdictions to impose sanctions on Hong Kong or apply administrative measures.

55
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,180
那會有負面影響對我們貿易和投資活動。

56
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,220
The chamber views passage and implementation of this bill as necessary.

57
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,570
因此，並未反對引入立法修訂，為目的之便利。

58
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,150
然而，為 safeguard 香港利益，而 complian with 這最新一組要求。

59
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,390
我們 propose a two-tier system.

60
00:10:47,670 --> 00:11:01,480
第一，的全面雙税協議，which may contain all of the provision of tax information exchange agreements， provide some benefit to companies active in Hong Kong。

61
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:10,040
作為such，CDTA's should be the default negotiating position in discussions with other jurisdictions.

62
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,990
第二。

63
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:20,040
當我們 do enter into stand-alone TIEAs， without the benefit of comprehensive double taxation agreements。

64
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:29,290
我們會 urge at the very important safeguards mentioned in our written submission， concern the confidentiality of information exchanges。

65
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,080
With treaty partners, be considered.

66
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,500
Further, we would wish to see legislation relating to factually incorrect or sensitive information.

67
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,370
在 particular， 我們會支持權利去 raise and pursue 通過法院。

68
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:53,420
objections to disclosure where the information sought is legally privileged, involves trade, commercial or professional secrets.

69
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,020
或 where such information cannot be shown to be relevant to the case at hand.

70
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,220
在利益、一致、清晰和確 certainty。

71
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:14,140
我們建議，封存於立法，任何DIPNs發出由內陸税務部，部在關聯到行為的資訊。

72
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,150
多謝。

73
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:24,840
Thank you, Mr. Oria。啊，第四位要發言嘅係香港信託人工會嘅劉家時女士。啊，唔該。

74
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:45,290
Hi, thank you very much for allowing Hong Kong Trust Association to present our views. Our Hong Kong Trust Association acknowledges that Hong Kong is the only member of the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for tax purposes. Yet to amend its legal framework

75
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,210
framework to allow entry into tiers.

76
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:59,360
having regard to this and to international economic developments, we believe it is no longer credible for Hong Kong to resist the introduction of a legal framework for tiers.

77
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:13,950
所以，however， we believe both the granting of a tier and exchange of information pursuant to a tier should also be having subject to appropriate safeguards to protect legitimate taxpayers' confidentiality.

78
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:23,900
我們 do request the government to review the need for additional legislative safeguards for EOA under a CDTA or TIA.

79
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:40,780
We know it is important. Now we do support a speedy introduction of the amendment law to allow Hong Kong to enter into tears. And it is important that the bill be enacted before the peer review group completes its phase two report in September 2013.

80
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:50,520
And phase two report will measure Hong Kong's actual implementation with the OECD standards relating to the exchange of information. Thank you very much.

81
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,090
Thank you, Miss Lau.嗯誒，跟住誒係香港税務學會嘅洪榮德先生。

82
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,290
啊，多謝主席。嗯。

83
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:07,810
首先我要多謝，其實香港政府同埋税務局嘅嘅人員，佢哋可以喺咁短時間內可以簽到差唔多二十九份全面性嘅。

84
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,420
誒，避免雙重課税嘅協議。

85
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:18,790
噉啊，香港係一個國際嘅城市啊，金融中心，全球嘅，亦我哋亦都係全球論壇嘅成員嚟嘅。

86
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:28,500
噉我哋亦都理解到咧，喺二零一零年、二零一一年嘅時候咧，全球論壇咧，我哋係香港係過咗第一階段嘅平衡嘅，關於呢個税務嘅透明度。

87
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,580
但係誒，我哋亦都知道喺嗰個。

88
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:51,870
過咗呢一個誒第一階段嘅時候咧，我哋亦都知道咧。其實我哋有一個條件咧，就係要喺在呢個交換協定上邊嘅框架咧，就係要作出一個立法嘅。因為而家我哋亦都有幸咧喺見到咧第二階段嗰啲平平核嘅嘅人員喺香港，噉佢哋亦都提過咧，如果我哋唔過嘅時候。

89
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,080
咧，我哋真係會畀人可能有機會咧，係會話我哋係一個唔合作嘅管轄區。

90
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:17,370
咁所以喺税務局、税務學會嘅立場嚟睇咧，我哋香港係一個簡單嘅税制，我哋唔係一個税務天堂，所以香港喺税務透明上邊咧，應該係要達到一個税國際嘅水平嘅。咁所以我哋學會咧係支持呢條條例嘅草案。咁當然喺支持呢個條例草案裏邊咧。

91
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:26,710
我哋亦都曾經要提出三點咧，就希望誒各位又去考慮一下咧。第一點嘅時候咧，就係如果呢條草案係通過咗之後，

92
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:43,740
而係有一個交換嘅協定係簽落咗嘅時候咧，我哋希望香港政府同埋呢個誒税務局咧，亦都係應該繼續去爭取係簽一份全面嘅協定，就唔係就咁有得佢話誒簽咗份交換嘅協定就有得佢啦。

93
00:15:44,040 --> 00:16:04,050
咁第二點咧，就係關於呢個提交資料。如果個納税人咧喺提交資料個嘅時候，誒對呢個政府係有意意見，或者提交嘅資料係有意見嘅時候咧，喺現時嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅條例裏邊咧，係只可以向呢個誒税務局嘅局長。

94
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,470
去提出佢嘅意見，而最後嘅決定咧，亦都係喺財政司司長上邊。

95
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:25,200
噉我哋咧係希望咧喺嗰度可以作出咧，可以畀一個納税人可以有一個可以喺上訴到法庭上邊嘅上訴機制。咁呢樣嘢咧，我哋就覺得喺公平性上邊可能會獨立性上邊可以做得比較好啲。

96
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:40,380
咁第三點咧，就係喺個草案第五條同埋第七條裏邊咧，係講關於修訂税務條例第五十一條及第五十二條有關呢個叫做管有後邊。

97
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:50,180
加咗呢個控制，即係possession，即係資料擁有，而家加係埋控制，噉就喺呢個possession後邊加control。

98
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:58,590
咁現時喺個草案條例裏邊咧，係冇一個解釋係講呢個控制嗰個嗰個。

99
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:18,880
個個意思係乜嘢？究竟佢個範圍係幾廣嘅？噉我哋希望，如果條條例草案係得到通過嘅時候咧，希望税局咧可以喺佢哋嗰個適宜及執行指引四十七條裏邊咧，係就住呢一個誒控制呢一個解釋咧。

100
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:33,620
係作出等到納税人係作出一個解釋，可以等到納税人係知道咧，究竟係要畀一啲咩資料咧，以免咧第日係觸犯咗呢一條條例嘅。咁呢個就係我哋税務學會所提出嘅意見啦。多謝。

101
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:53,910
啊，唔該曬啊，菲力。噉啊，跟住嗰位要發言嘅就係香港投資基金公會嘅黃黃綽明女士，唔該曬你。誒，主席，嗯，多謝提供今日呢個機會啦，畀投資基金公會咧，就係即係同大家分享一下我哋嘅睇法嘅。咁對於咧政府提出呢一個嘅。

102
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:13,920
修訂嘅議案啦，我哋工會咧就係支持嘅。咁因為我哋咧，其實要睇翻咧嗰個大環境同埋國際嘅趨勢啦。咁喺過去咧十年八載咧，尤其即係過去個三五年添啦，我哋見到咧個全球嘅趨勢咧，對於嗰個嘅税務透明同埋交換嘅信息方面。

103
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:33,930
其實個門檻啊，同埋個要求咧，就係越嚟越提高嘅。咁為咗配合翻呢個國際嘅趨勢啦，而香港作為一個咁外向型嘅都市，咁即係同海外嘅市場嘅接觸咧咁大嘅，我哋一定咧就係要能夠係達標，達到基本嘅國際要求。

104
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:53,940
而今次政府提出呢個要求咧，唔係話一啲錦上添花嘅嘢，而係就話我哋要點樣係做到最基本嘅門檻。咁所以呢一樣嘢咧，我哋覺得係刻不容緩嘅。而且咧，亦大家亦都留意到咧，就係全球論壇嗰度咧，第一階段嘅我哋做咗，但係第二階段咧，其實咧。

105
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:13,950
我哋逼在眉睫咧，就係話要點樣去過到第二階段。如果前設咧，我哋就係要喺呢一個Tier方面咧，要提綱一個個法律嘅框架嘅。咁所以咧，我希望咧就係大家喺討論呢個問題嗰陣時咧，要明白嗰個迫切性同埋個重要性，同埋嗰樣嘢咧唔係為一啲。

106
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:33,960
叫做nice to have嘅嘢，而係一啲基本嘅嘢。我哋一定要做到，先能夠咧就係達到國際嘅標準嘅。咁同埋一方面咧，我哋亦都唔好忽視咧，就話呢一樣嘢對維持我哋競爭力咧，其實非常之重要。咁而你見到好多其他周邊嘅國家，好似新加坡咁啦，啱啱佢先咧就發布咗。

107
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:53,970
有幾個政策措施咧，就係要強化佢哋嗰個嘅誒信息交換方面嘅。咁所以呢一樣嘢咧，對於嗰個維持香港競爭力咧，其實極之重要。咁最後一點補充翻咧，就係我哋睇到喺政府啦，喺呢個過程裏邊咧，唔會話因為為咗要符合國際。

108
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:13,980
嘅要求，而咧犧牲咗嗰個個投資者保障或者個私隱方面嘅，你會見到咧，佢係喺嗰個過程裏邊提出嘅動議咧，每一點都係好著意，就話點樣去保障嗰個私隱。咁所以我哋覺得咧，佢喺呢個過程裏邊咧，做咗一個好合適嘅平衡。多謝主席。

109
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:24,230
好，唔該曬阿Sally。噉係另外一位要發言嘅人士就係嗯，Mr. David Weiser from the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong。啊，David，please。

110
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:40,070
Thank you. Good afternoon. American Chamber Commerce thanks the Bills Committee and FSB for the invitation to provide our views regarding the Inland Revenue Bill 2013. Let me begin by stating that AmCham supports the bill and urges its enactment as soon as possible.

111
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,840
我的 thoughts 係呢。

112
00:20:42,300 --> 00:21:02,310
國際態度 towards cross border exchange of tax information have changed dramatically in the last 15 years. The OECD issued a landmark report on harmful tax competition, which began substantial efforts to force so called tax havens to comply with specified minimum levels of behaviours designed to counter international tax evasion.

113
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,470
In light of the possibility of adverse cast consequences, all complied.

114
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:28,150
金融中心，是both onshore and offshore and around the world， have recognised these developments and taken a step to be more accommodating to the concerns of the OECD. For example, we know that in Singapore in May 2013 announced a series of steps to strengthen its exchange of tax information, by sniffily strengthening its framework for tax cooperation to combat tax offences.

115
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:48,440
Turning to Hong Kong, the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes identified a number of deficiencies in Hong Kong's current law. The forum's peer review noted that Hong Kong's laws do not permit taxpayer information to be exchanged under a standalone TIA, but only pursuant to DTA. The group recommended that Hong Kong should amend

116
00:21:48,440 --> 00:22:03,390
和它的税法，來 permit it to enter an ATA。 The OECD global forum clearly rejects the view that jurisdictions should exchange information only pursuant to DTAs， as Hong Kong has been doing to date， and states that jurisdictions must be willing to enter an ATA。

117
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:14,890
The model TIA promulgated by the OECD represents a globally accepted template for these TIs. It's therefore essential that Hong Kong tax laws permit it be permitted to comply with the terms of such model agreement.

118
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:35,180
Ian Champ believes the bill is a critical step to enabling Hong Kong to demonstrate its willingness to move forward towards international norms regarding exchange of information. Failure to adopt the bill would leave Hong Kong clearly behind international norms in this area, and would become a target for international attention and criticism, out of step of international norms adopted by other financial centres.

119
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:51,530
We believe the enactment of the bill is essential to maintain the competitiveness and reputation of Hong Kong and Hong Kong's financial service. If the OECD or member countries were to impose sanctions against Hong Kong, as listed above, for Hong Kong's failure to enact the bill, it would be severe in adverse effect on Hong Kong and its economy.

120
00:22:51,950 --> 00:23:06,340
在我們的觀點，香港政府有現實的評估這些考慮，而IRD是決心繼續優先處理DTAs而非TAs，以説服其他國家加入前者而非後者。

121
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:27,420
As from a timing point of view, as mentioned before, it's very important that the bill be enacted before the peer review completes its phase two report in September two thousand and thirteen. The phase two report will measure Hong Kong's actual implementation of and compliance with OECD standards. AMCham supports the bill and we believe Hong Kong government has a realistic assessment of various policy considerations as such.

122
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,670
We urge enactment as soon as possible.

123
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:39,670
Thank you, Mr. Weisner. And the next deputation will be from the Hong Kong Association Banks. We have Miss Christine Tang. I'm going,啊等我先。

124
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:54,710
Thank you, Honourable Chairman, members of the Bills Committee, members of the Administration. As the representative for the Hong Kong Association of Banks, I'm honoured today to demonstrate support for the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill 2013.

125
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,620
The attitude toward exchange of tax information has undergone significant changes in the past decades.

126
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,170
There has been increasing demand internationally for transparency.

127
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,130
ability and willingness to exchange tax information.

128
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,870
has become the norm.

129
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,590
countries which are labelled as uncooperative, have been named and shamed.

130
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,040
在一個OECD報告，發布在年2000。

131
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,750
它explicitly stated that OECD countries will impose sanctions against jurisdiction which refuse to cooperate.

132
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,600
這些 sanction to name a few， include imposing withholding taxes。

133
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,740
imposing transactional charges and levies on transactions.

134
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,200
Disallowing deductions, exemptions.

135
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,140
Credits and other allowances related to transactions with uncooperative jurisdictions.

136
00:24:50,740 --> 00:25:02,900
Denied deductions and cost recovery, which otherwise would be allowed for fees and expenses incurred in establishing or acquiring entities in uncooperative jurisdictions.

137
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,830
enhance audit and enforcement activities.

138
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:17,130
Comprehensive information reporting rules and penalties for incorrect reporting or non-reporting of transactions.

139
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:28,510
now all these penalties or and sanctions no doubt will increase the cost of doing business and discourage investors to conduct business with uncooperative jurisdictions.

140
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,250
香港是個國際金融中心。

141
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,560
yet，香港是唯一成員，of the global forum。

142
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,260
That not having a legal framework to cater for tax information exchange agreements.

143
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,300
如果這條法案不是通過，以允許香港進入Tier。

144
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,170
香港是 likely to be regarded as uncooperative, and faces potential sanctions.

145
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,030
This will adversely impact our reputation and competitiveness.

146
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,580
as such, the Hong Kong Association of Banks supports the bill.

147
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:14,530
and urges that it be enacted to enable Hong Kong to abide by the new norm in order to sustain its competitiveness in the international arena. Thank you.

148
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,300
Thank you, Miss Tang.

149
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:28,880
噉啊，各位團體嘅代表嘅發言已經完咗啦。噉就團體提出嘅意見，各位委員誒，有冇咩問題咧？啊！

150
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:51,060
啊，陳建波議員唔該。啊，主席會唔會揾政府誒回應下頭先特別係嗱？我哋一間咧就會揾政府回應嘅，但係就佢哋所提出嘅要點，你哋有冇一啲嘅嘢想澄清啊，或者有冇啲問題想向佢哋提問嘅啦？我我想誒，政府如果即刻回應咧，就能夠特別針對香港總。

151
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,430
總商會嗰個誒兩個tier嘅嘅安排咧，好好得。

152
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:20,240
嗱，如果各位委員冇誒特別嘅問題嘅時候咧，我就請誒政府咧係向誒各位團體所提出一啲嘅問題咧，作一個整體嘅回應，大概誒五至六分鐘嚇。唔該，編委阿阿秘書長，唔該。好唔該啊，主席。首先咧，我誒代表政府。

153
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,570
當局咧就誒多謝總共，我哋今次透過法案委員會咧，就收到有十九份嘅意見書。

154
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:42,420
咁今天咧就有八個團體出席嘅。咁誒，我哋上個禮拜五咧就誒睇到秘書處咧誒提交畀我哋咧，就總共有關嘅嗰啲意見書咧。噉我哋我都細心每一份咧，我都有細心去參閲。

155
00:27:42,700 --> 00:28:02,710
咁誒喺大部分嘅意見書裏邊咧，正如今日嘅在座嘅團體誒，剛才嘅發言咧，我哋都好高興咧睇到大部分嘅團體咧，對於我哋呢一條嘅誒税務條例嘅修訂草案係表示支持，而當中咧有啲團體亦都表示咧，希望我哋能夠加快步伐咧，可以盡快。

156
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:17,460
立例咧，令到我哋喺全球論壇嘅嗰個相互評估裏邊咧，能夠係可以得到嗰個嘅確認，而唔會咧係受到有關嘅誒委員咧，就係認為我哋係未能夠有效咁落實嗰個資料交換嘅安排。

157
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:38,050
剛才咧有幾個團體咧就特別有誒提出一啲嘅意見啦，咁或者我畀一個總體嘅回應。誒特別譬如總商會啊、誒税務學會啦，喺佢哋嗰個嘅誒資料提交咧，都有表明就係話誒雖然大體上支持有關嗰個嘅誒交換協定嘅誒法律嘅。

158
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:58,060
框架噉，但係咧都希望咧，我哋喺無論喺政策同埋喺誒，我哋日後做談判嘅時候咧，係可以咧仍然將我哋嗰個嘅比重係擺喺去談判呢一個避免雙重徵税個交換協定嗰方面，而反為做一個嘅獨立嘅資料交換協定。

159
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:18,070
咧應該就係話唔係我哋嗰個政策嘅比重嚟嘅。咁呢一點咧喺我哋嘅誒資料摘要同埋我哋一路推出呢一條嘅條例草案喺財經事務委員會咧，我哋都有強調咧，就係我哋認為而家令到香港要用一個最少修訂嘅方式咧，去達到國際嘅標準咧。

160
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:38,080
我哋必須咧要喺個條例嘅法定嘅條例嗰度咧有一個法律嘅框架，令到我哋有一個賦權嘅條文。咁但係雖然咧有咗，我哋希望過咗呢條條例咧係能夠兩方面誒個C D T A或者Tier咧兩方面都有個法律框架。咁但係我哋咧亦都好明白咧有關嘅持份者。

161
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:58,090
同埋我哋誒香港社會咧，我哋係好希望睇到我哋係能夠同我哋嘅貿易夥伴咧，係集中咧推廣再多啲咧係關於嗰個C D T A嘅談判啊。咁所以今次個條例草案咧，正如我哋上次同委員解釋咧，點解我哋喺除咗做嗰個法律嘅框架咧，我哋都喺有兩方面咧做。

162
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:18,100
出一啲嘅優化，誒包括嗰個披露限制啦，同埋嗰個税種嗰度。其實依兩樣嘢咧，都係我哋喺經考慮過嗰個嘅國際嘅標準，同埋香港我哋嘅情況之下咧，我哋做咗呢一方面嘅優化咧，係令到我哋喺同我哋日後嘅貿易夥伴去談判嘅時候咧，誒C D T A嘅談判嘅時候。

163
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:38,110
我哋能夠顯示到咧，我哋喺嗰個嘅資料交換安排上邊咧，係能夠誒比較實際上滿足到佢哋嗰個嘅要求，達到佢哋嗰個資料交換嘅訴求。呢一個咧，我哋認為係極為對於我哋去日後進一步推C D T A嗰個談判咧。

164
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:58,120
係非常非常之係重要嘅一環嚟嘅。咁誒呢一個咧，我哋就都想強調一下。咁所以咧，就即係誒，我哋喺所謂頭先總商會提到，即係話會唔會係一個two tier噉樣做啦？我哋個大體嗰個政策咧，嗰個嘅誒比重咧，一定係喺個C D T A。噉我呢度咧，我都要指出就係。

165
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:18,130
可能個別嘅一啲嘅誒貿易夥伴啊，或者係税區咧，佢哋其實同香港嗰個貿易係比較少嘅。咁但係咧，佢哋可能都會有一個嘅誒訴求，係希望冇做一個避免嘅雙重徵税嘅協定之餘咧，都能夠就住一啲税務資料咧，能夠做到交換。咁喺呢一啲嘅誒。

166
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:38,140
誒税區咧，咁當然我哋唔可以咧，係同佢哋拒絕咧，去探討咧，係誒做C D T A或者Tier。咁喺呢一啲噉嘅情況下咧，我哋第日喺誒擬定我哋嗰個談判嘅策略嘅時候咧，我哋必定咧係會希望盡量推廣C D T A。而如果我哋真係喺某一啲情況，

167
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:58,150
下要同一啲税區去傾tier咧，我哋都會咧有幾點要小心考慮嘅。第一咧就係佢嗰個嘅法律框架，佢佢哋嘅當地法律有冇就住保障一啲資料嘅保密性，同埋保障嗰個納税人個誒嘅嘅誒知情權啊嗰方面咧。

168
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:18,160
係有佢哋一定嘅喺個本地法律嘅保障嘅。第二方面咧，就係佢哋咧同其他嘅，譬如經合組織、其他嘅税區去做咗TIA嘅簽訂之後咧，佢哋有啲乜嘢嘅資料咧，係曾經要求過第啲嘅誒夥伴咧去交誒，我哋都會去考慮嘅。因為呢幾方面咧都會。

169
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:25,780
會對於日後我哋誒睇税局咧，佢哋處理依啲噉嘅安排同埋請求嘅時候，嗰個嘅資源會係點嘅？

170
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:46,070
最後一點咧，我諗誒時間關係啦，誒我就想最後強調就係話喺保障嗰方面咧，我哋係好強調保障納税人個私隱知情權同埋個資料保密性嘅一係列嘅保障咧，我哋除咗會喺嗰個嘅日後嘅交換協定嘅條文裏邊咧，有各個條款。

171
00:32:46,070 --> 00:33:06,080
去定定之外咧，我哋亦都咧會喺我哋嗰個嘅披露誒限制資料嘅規則裏邊咧，都有一係列嘅一啲嘅誒保障嘅條款，令到咧我哋達到一個雙重保障噉樣樣嘅效果。咁所以咧，我哋日後做嗰個tier嘅法律框架咧，會將C D T A嗰個誒保障嘅。

172
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,410
嘅嗰個我哋嘅原則同埋我哋嘅措施咧，同樣適用喺Tier嗰方面嘅，噉就誒。

173
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:33,700
最後咧，我都想強調一下，有團體咧亦都表示，即係話我哋點樣能夠喺誒保障納税人嗰個嘅誒權益，同埋我哋去達到國際嗰個嘅標準，到到做到平衡咧。噉我我想強調一點咧，就係我哋今次咧嗰個條例草案係以一個最

174
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:53,710
少必須嘅修訂方式。誒，我哋絕對無意係盲目追隨一個世界嘅潮流，係誒要超前其他嘅税區咧，去達到嗰個國際嘅標準。當然有部分團體可能覺得我哋嘅步伐比較慢啊，咁但係我哋咧都喺呢一方面好小心謹慎嘅，我哋。

175
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:13,720
個誒策略咧，係希望我哋喺相互評估咧，唔會咧係得到誒一個唔合格嘅表現。咁但係咧，我哋唔會為著咧要得到一個好嘅表現咧而盲目咧，將好多嘅一啲國際嘅誒水準咧，我哋係用一個好大量嘅修訂方式咧，喺我哋嘅條例草案裏邊引入嘅。嚇，多謝主席。

176
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:33,730
誒唔該曬啊，副秘書長，我就頭先其實頭先啊有一位誒誒嘅代表，好似應該係都係General Chamber of Commerce嘅嘅朋友嘅發言咧。我想想問一問一個即係問題，就係話關於一啲legally profess誒professionally privileged嘅嘅文件啊，或者係一啲商業。

177
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:53,740
秘密嘅文件，呢兩類嘅文件咧，喺現在你嗰個草案框架入邊啊，如果嗰個納税人係唔想税局去啊展示啲文件嘅時候，有啲乜嘢方法佢哋可以即係話啊，佢哋係覺得呢啲係一啲啊受到啊professional privilege或者legal privilege。

178
00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:13,750
保障嘅文件而唔去disclose，有冇一啲噉嘅嘅機制咧？唔該誒，或者我誒整體講一講誒，有需要請阿局長可以補充嘅。首先咧，就誒我睇到唔少嘅團體咧，就都誒重視嗰個法律嘅專業保密權啊（legal privilege）。咁而誒，我可以誒指出咧。

179
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:33,760
有關呢個保障咧，喺而家現行税務條例嘅五十一四A條裏邊咧，係列明咗誒。如果有一啲資料咧係涉及會批可能披露誒嗰個當事人享有嘅一啲嘅法律專業保密權咧，有關有關嘅資料咧係無需要喺呢一個嘅。

180
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,520
嘅誒協定嘅誒資料安排下咧，係作出披露嘅。

181
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:58,810
第二方面咧，就係如果一啲嘅資料咧，係涉及一啲誒營商啊、商業秘密咧，有關嘅呢一個嘅誒資料安排咧，亦都係我哋係冇噉樣嘅責任咧，係可以需要要去作出交換。依兩方面嘅所謂一啲保障嘅權力咧，喺有關嘅交。

182
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:17,790
交換協定嘅文本個範本咧，係有誒一個明文嘅條文咧，可去定定嘅。咁而有關嘅協定咧，我哋日後咧都會採納呢個經合組織個範本。有關嘅協定咧，亦都會透過本地立法咧，通過個法令咧，能夠成為咧我哋嘅法律嘅條文嘅規定嘅。

183
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:38,240
好唔該，副秘書長誒，如果各位委員對誒，頭先團體嘅發言再冇其他嘅誒質詢嘅時候咧，我就再一次多謝今日嚟到發表意見團體。嗱，如果你哋冇將你呢個發言稿誒畀咗我哋立法會嘅職員嘅時候咧，你可唔可以咧就誒留翻一個？

184
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:58,250
誒copy畀我哋，或者你之後再補翻上啦。如果你冇冇冇畀我哋一個發言稿嘅時候，and I think I have to formally thank everyone, every delegation for making their presence today. And if your speaking notes hasn't been sent to the last call staff, would you please kindly

185
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,430
Leave a copy for us so that we can make reference to that in future. Thank you very much for your attendance.

186
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,130
呢度係集合咗幾多個啊？

187
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,270
邊度呢棟嘢？

188
00:37:52,380 --> 00:38:12,390
好噉，而家呢一節嘅時間咧，就係我哋同翻呢個誒政府當局去討論翻呢條嘅誒條例草案。咁誒，政府當局就收到一啲嘅誒書面嘅誒文件咧，就做咗一啲嘅回應嘅。

189
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,810
咁而家咧，啊，我叫我哋立法會嘅同事咧，係派翻呢一個書面回應咧，啊，去各位手上。

190
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,200
噉我就提議大家用翻大概。

191
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:39,470
五分鐘到啦，去去去睇一睇，或者我我畀五分鐘時間大家睇一睇呢啲回應啦。就就住呢啲回應同埋誒呢個草案嘅其他原則性嘅問題咧，希望我哋再再有一個誒討論嘅時間嚇。唔該曬。

192
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,630
啊。

193
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,470
佢就誒對十六份意見使用嚟應。

194
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,940
出咗十六份，即係你收到十六份，都係啦，十六份嚟嘅。

195
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,930
所以就係。

196
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,220
佢冇啲塵啊嘛，佢啲衫嗰啲咩？

197
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,620
中文未得，未有。

198
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,890
好，好，好。

199
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:09,800
好，各位委員，仲需唔需要多啲時間啊？如果唔OK嘅話咧，噉你哋有咩問題，而家可以隨便提出嚟嘅啦嚇。

200
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,460
好，我畀多五分鐘你哋。

啊！各位委員，仲需唔需要多時間啊？唔需要啦嘛。

203
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,400
有冇咩問題啊？

204
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,090
誒，噉。

205
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:52,830
秘書長，我有一個問題咧，就係關於嗰個嗰個誒交換咗個資料嘅使用啊。

206
00:48:53,110 --> 00:49:13,120
噉我哋睇翻你喺第十八頁，就其實嗰個Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants咧，亦都係提出咗一個問題嘅。你又有啲回覆就係話咧，當呢啲資料如果已經係畀咗另外一個Commission Authority嘅時候咧，佢係可以。

207
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,080
啊。

208
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:34,370
應用喺非税務嘅一啲用途嗰度啊，呢啲我解讀係啱唔啱嘅咧嚇？係好啊，或者我誒講解一解呢一度，噉就誒而家誒經合組織佢誒嗰個資料交換嘅誒條文咧，佢就喺個誒commentary嗰度咧都有誒誒更新到就係話誒。

209
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:54,380
佢哋可誒預見到有一啲嘅誒税區咧，佢哋簽訂咗有關嘅協定之後，其實佢哋嘅本地法律有另外一啲法例咧，係誒定明誒，如果誒雙方就住一啲税務資料係有作出交換，而當中嘅資料咧，可能誒有關嘅方面係懷疑同一啲誒另。

210
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:14,390
外嘅一啲嘅執法嘅目的係有關嘅。咁咧，如果雙方嘅誒competent authority嘅主管當局咧，係喺信立係符合當地嘅法律，同埋佢哋係要喺雙方同意嘅情況之下咧，根據嗰個法律嘅規定係作為提交畀誒對方嗰個嘅。

211
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:30,960
誒協定夥伴嘅執法嘅當局嘅喺香港嘅情況嚟講咧，誒我需要指出就係話誒過往近一兩年咧，為著去誒誒針對打擊一啲販毒、追討得益嘅誒。

212
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:51,270
目的或者係打擊一啲有組織及嚴重罪行嘅目的，誒或者係一啲反恐怖主義措施嘅目的咧。喺呢三方面嘅誒誒情況之下，香港咧都立咗一啲特定嘅法律咧，而裏邊係有一個嘅誒條文都分別定明，如果誒。

213
00:50:51,270 --> 00:51:11,280
主管當局係接觸到一啲嘅誒税務嘅資料，而呢啲資料咧喺上述有關嘅情況下，誒係懷疑同嗰個調查或者執法有關咧，咁誒誒嗰個嘅主管當局咧係可以喺誒呢一啲嘅替約夥伴嘅協定之下咧，係作為提交畀嗰。

214
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:31,290
個嘅執法當局咧嚟到做誒知識嘅噉，所以咧，我哋係有見及誒經合組織裏邊嘅有關嘅條文，同埋亦都係符合我哋本地法律嘅規定啦。我哋日後如果係同一啲誒替約夥伴去做談判嘅時候咧，我哋都會因應有關我哋自己嘅法律嘅規定咧，喺我哋嗰個談判。

215
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:51,300
同埋個協定裏邊咧，我哋會透過一啲詳細嘅條文去引述翻呢幾條嘅條文，以知咧等大家都雙方清楚知道喺乜嘢嘅情況之下咧，我哋先至可以作一個資料交換。我哋認為噉樣樣咧係可以咧，係既能滿足我哋本嚟法律嘅規定，又能夠咧係可以達到。

216
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,910
經合組織就著個資料交換條文，而家最新嘅嗰個演繹咧嘅有關嘅規定嘅。

217
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:06,740
啊，副秘書長，我有一個問題就係話，當如果嗱，其實而家講緊係兩方面雙向嘅資料交換啦，嗱，如果

218
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:27,180
一個替約國同香港特區替咗替約咗一個Tear之後咧，佢就將呢啲資料畀咗香港嘅有關當局，即係税務局啦。呢呢個情況，第一個情況，我想知道嘅啦。嗱，如果香港税務當局係知道呢一，

219
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:47,190
一啲嘅資料係同呢個誒一啲有組織嘅罪行啊，或者係誒呢個誒恐怖活動有關，即係話呢三條條例有關，即係四零五四五零四五七五呢三條條例有關嘅資料，你哋係咪會主動將呢一？

220
00:52:47,190 --> 00:53:07,200
啲嘅信息提供畀有翻嘅執執法當局，即係譬如警方啊，或者誒其他嘅即係有關嘅執法機構啦，嚇。好啊，誒就住嗰個實際嘅操作同埋而家依三條條文下邊定明税務當局嘅嗰個權力同埋個責任咧，我請阿趙局長可以詳細解。

221
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,990
正嚇。

222
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,390
主席。

223
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:20,630
喺呢個經濟合作組織最新二零一二年嗰個資料交換嗰個條文嘅範本裏邊咧，佢係新加入咗有一段文字，就話。

224
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,450
所交換嘅税務資料可以用作其他用途。

225
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:30,270
如果雙方個法律都容許呢一種嘅用途，

226
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:50,580
而雙方嘅主管當局都同意喺呢個情況可以噉樣用。換句話，雙方嘅法律係一樣，雙方嘅主管當局都係同意咁先個資料交換咗之後，先可以作第三種用途，除咗作税務用途之外嘅。嗱，亦即係話咧啊！

227
00:53:50,580 --> 00:54:10,590
啊，趙局長，即係對方咧都要有翻一個類似我哋嘅drug trafficking，或者我哋嘅organisation serious crimes，或者係反恐嘅條例，類似嘅條例係容許佢將嗰啲資料由税務當局去識出去畀其他嘅執法者咧，我哋先可以將收到嘅。

228
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:30,600
資料去畀呢個本地嘅執法嘅當局，反之過嚟咧。如果香港將一啲資料畀咗另一個國家咧，咁另外第嗰個替約國亦都要有同樣好似我哋香港呢三條條例嘅法例啦，類似佢哋先可以將。

229
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:44,240
呢啲資料去畀佢哋有關嘅執法當局係咪咧？主席，你嘅理解係正確嘅。不過我要補充一點咧，我哋首先要喺嗰個協議或者安排要加入咗呢個條文先。

230
00:54:44,520 --> 00:55:04,530
噉就會有呢個後果啦。係喺你去誒訂立協議入嘅嘅嘅期間咧，嗰個條文入邊咧，除咗你加咗O E C D嗰個最標準嗰個範本之外咧，即係話可以作第三用途之外咧，你會唔會再好仔細咁加埋呢一啲噉嘅類似嘅？

231
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,440
嘅誒條例，即係話反恐條例等等，喺入邊咧，會唔會列埋出嚟嘅咧？

232
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:16,720
嗱誒，主席就呢度咧，因為如果純粹係嗰個資料交換嘅安排咧，就。

233
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:37,340
經插造造益有一個範本，噉我哋香港會跟嗰個範本咯。但係呢點咧，我諗我仲言之尚早，因為嗰個範本我哋香港個嗰個model，我哋叫做香港範本，都要審慎定下先嘅。不如根據O E C D嗰個誒Model Tax Convention嗰個全面性嘅。

234
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:44,040
嘅税務協議嗰個範本咧，噉就有一個條文定咗喺度嘅。不過至於細節細，

235
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:54,110
誒喺執行細節上落實咧，我諗雙方嘅主管當局咧要有一個默契，有一個共識，先可以進行嘅。

236
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:59,360
即係我知咧，其實咧，除咗個誒主要嘅誒。

237
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:19,860
條款之外咧，好多時咧，你簽咗嗰個agreement之後咧，都有一啲protocol係會supplement嗰個main agreement。咁如果喺Tier嗰個誒框架底下，會唔會好似C T T A咁有一啲之後嘅protocol有都都可可以容許㗎嘛？O E C D嗰個範本入邊。

238
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:39,870
主席，主席，誒，我諗呢一個大原則咧，我哋會誒跟隨O E C D嗰個範本。咁誒喺個談判過程之中咧，因為雙方面嘅，噉我哋咧都會喺呢一方面爭取用一個比較最清晰、誒最誒誒誒誒詳細嘅一啲嘅條文咧，令到雙方咧能夠誒可以。

239
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:40,920
清楚誒。

240
00:56:41,200 --> 00:57:00,280
大家相互之間嘅安排，咁誒，好似主席你頭先建議喺個protocol考慮喺嗰方面做一啲嘅一啲細則嘅定明咧，呢個我哋可以考慮嘅。好，唔該曬，誒唔好意思啊，佔咗其他委員嘅時間，其他委員有冇一啲嘅政策上問題，想想同局方再啊～

241
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:21,880
討論姚思榮議員，唔該。係多謝主席。誒，想問下咧，就如果替約國就超出咗誒雙方協定嘅範圍而濫用咗即係一啲誒個人私隱嘅資料咧，咁當局可以做嘅係邊方面嘅工作咧？唔知係，比司長。

242
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:41,890
各位啊，主席誒，瞭解到阿姚思榮議員咧都好誒緊張謹慎，我哋呢一方面咁誒，我諗兩方面回答啦。第一方面咧就係誒，我哋喺誒同誒替約國去做呢個協定嘅誒磋商嘅時候咧，誒雙方咧都要跟隨翻嗰個嘅誒經合組織個範本裏邊定明咧。

243
00:57:41,890 --> 00:58:01,900
有關嘅資料咧，係要作呢個税務嘅用途。剛才提到，如果係誒一啲不誒唔係税務嘅用途咧，都係會跟翻雙方嗰個嘅誒法律框架嚟做。咁呢一方面咧，我哋會跟隨翻有關嘅原則。第二方面咧，就係當我哋收到呢替約國咧畀我哋誒嘅資料請求嘅時候咧。

244
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:21,910
誒，正如我哋上一次嘅法案委員會裏邊提到，誒，我哋會要求誒替約國咧，係提交一份陳述書，裏邊嘅陳述書咧係要清楚列明佢要求嘅呢一個資料咧，誒個目的同埋性質為何，所以我哋咧誒税局咧係需要知道佢。

245
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:41,920
要嘅嗰個資料咧，係攞嚟做啲乜嘢嘅用途？誒，同啲乜嘢嘅税務嘅評核或者係執法咧係有關。咁而佢哋咧先至會信立咗喺有關嘅陳述書裏邊嘅資料之後咧，先至會係向納税人或者係第三者咧索取有關嘅資料嘅。好，唔該，葉思榮就冇。咁即係話誒，我哋只。

246
00:58:41,920 --> 00:59:01,930
能夠就去雙方商談啦，即係冇乜辦法，即係好似上次話，即係最多就中止雙方面嗰個協議嘅啫，即係最後啲招㗎啦，即係冇其他中間可以解決嘅辦法。係，李司長。主席，誒，我都可以recap一下，誒，根據頭先我哋所講嘅嗰個噉嘅法律框架咧，咁其實税局可以做嘅就係話，如果

247
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:21,940
當對方咧提出嘅資料咧係唔得完整，或者係未能夠展述佢有關嘅性質同埋目的咧，税局咧係會有權可以拒絕誒誒去幫佢做誒提交呢啲資料。誒税局咧係會向佢指出有關嘅請求咧係未能夠反映嗰個目的同性質。咁如果佢哋提出。

248
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:41,950
咗之後咧，雙方亦都可以透過溝通啦，同埋誒一個文件嘅誒大家嘅交換咧，希望對方咧能夠進一步提供資料。如果佢能夠進一步提供資料而能夠滿足到税局咧，税局就可以幫佢再跟進。但係如果佢係冇再提供進一步資料咧，税局就冇一個責任咧去處理。

249
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:58,680
翻佢原先提出嗰個嘅誒要求嘅，最終如果雙方面咧真係有就著呢一方面嘅意見係有所不同咧，我哋上次都有提到就話，我哋都係會本着一個互讓互讓嘅精神咧，希望可以透過協商咧，能夠係誒。

250
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:18,970
澄清啦，誒，以至咧係盡能夠咧係誒配合到佢嘅需要嘅。到到最極端極端嘅例子，如果雙方真係誒，我哋我哋認為對方咧係冇本着一個好合作嘅精神去做咧，咁當然任何嘅雙邊嘅協定咧，都係有誒，唔排除如果有需要嘅時。

251
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:38,980
後咧係誒，任何一方係會提出可以中止嘅。好唔該，李司長誒。誒，最後就係話，如果真係我提交咗啦，佢又濫用咗啦，噉就誒嗰個即係納税人，佢又告到去法院啊。咁法院方面咧，即係香港嘅法院啦啊。咁香港法院喺呢方面做唔做到嘢嘅，其實？

252
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,130
係，秘書長。

253
01:00:40,410 --> 01:01:00,420
誒法院咧，其實誒依個就要視乎個納税人，如果係向法院提出一個誒司法嘅複核，就著税局局長嘅決定或者財政司司長嘅決定咧，咁依一個就會係跟翻個法律嘅訴訟嘅程序嘅。如果喺法庭嘅程序之下，證明有關嗰個決定咧，認為係不符、不合法、誒不合嗰。

254
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:20,430
個法理嘅話咧，咁税局長當然咧就係要改變佢有關個決決定之下所做嘅安排。誒喺一個極端嘅情況下，如果嗰個納税人認為有關嘅資料係未能夠誒符合嗰個法律上面嘅要求，税局係誒提供有關嘅資料咧。誒誒，如果我哋係。

255
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:40,440
覺得有關嘅對方咧係未能夠咧係遵循嗰個協定或者法律精神去誒處理咧誒，税局當然可以提出咧一個嚴正嘅聲明，或者係誒誒抗議。咁亦都可以誒透過喺O E C D經合組織嗰度咧係指出嘅。咁誒誒，我哋喺我哋誒睇到其。

256
01:01:40,440 --> 01:02:00,450
其他嘅替約國咧呢一方面咧，因為都有一個溝通同埋協商嘅程序，咁所以誒，我哋暫時都睇到甚少咧，會需要去到呢一步。咁誒，其實O E C D咧嗰方面咧，都好着重喺呢一方面嘅嗰個嘅大家有個嘅溝通嘅做法。咁所以佢哋定時咧都會安排一啲嘅會面啊，或者。

257
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:14,730
係一啲培訓啊，或者係一啲嘅誒seminars咧，等有關嘅方面喺做資料蒐集或者交換嘅時候，一啲實質嘅誒操作經驗咧，係可以大家有多啲嘅交流嘅。好，唔該，葉思榮仲有冇其他問題？

258
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,060
啊！

259
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,130
陳建波議員有冇？

260
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:39,450
問題，我想快啲進入去逐條審決。得得得，我呢樣你講咗多次。我哋嘅法律顧問有冇咩其他問題？唔該。對對，主席，嗯，就頭先主席提聲誒講過咧，就係誒第誒而家二零一二年咧，政府當根據政府當通過講嗰個範本咧，就話誒呢啲交換咗資料，除咗係為一税務嘅目的之外咧，可能都會。

261
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:59,460
即係對於第時有噉嘅條文嘅話咧，就會誒，的都可以用其他嘅誒誒用途嚟用呢啲誒交換咗資料嘅。咁政府都繼續提到嗰三個條例咧，就係四零五章、四五五章同埋五七五章啦。咁當如果第時真係我哋同外國傾咗呢啲有關嘅C D T A又好嘢T E I嘢又好，係有個噉嘅條文嘅。

262
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:09,110
話你個賦權，你係根據翻一一二章啊，定係你會跟翻根據呢呢呢頭先講嗰嗰三章法例咧？因為如果你睇翻一一二章第十四十九條咧。

263
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,450
誒，就算改咗之後咧。

264
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:33,620
四廿九誒一大A及B段咧，佢都係講話呢啲披露誒誒有關嘅税項資料咧，係作為該條文標的的誒之該地區的税項有關嘅啫喎。咁如果唔同税項有關嘅話，你就唔可以依賴呢一條條文嘅咯嚇。係啊，主席。

265
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:53,630
主席，回應下法律顧問，誒好清晰嘅四零五四五五五七五有關嘅條文咧，當時定立嘅時候咧，裏邊都係有清晰誒一個clearly express嘅provision啦，就去定明誒税務當局咧，如果係誒佢誒有一啲資料懷疑同依三條條文之下嘅嗰幾個。

266
01:03:53,630 --> 01:04:13,640
個目的或者啲資料有關咧，誒有關呢幾份嘅條例咧，裏邊係定明嗰個誒權力畀税務當局咧係作資料嘅披露嘅，咁所以咧嗰個誒in other words咧嗰個嘅權力咧係來自於三條嘅條文，而唔係我哋而家今次做嘅嗰個税務條例嘅修訂草案，只不過就係話當我哋去做。

267
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:33,650
談判嘅時候咧，嗰個協定咧，我哋係會引述翻誒有關嘅呢一啲本地嘅法律所定明，畀税務當局嘅有關嘅權嘅。咁喺技術上，即係當你第時即係簽咗呢啲C D C T A或者T I A都好咧，當你立法會誒去誒做先定案後審議嗰個階段嘅時候，嗰個賦權條文就會寫明一一一二。

268
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:53,660
加埋個另外三個有關嘅條文嘅，係係咪噉樣？即係話，如果我哋喺嗰個嘅誒協定嘅條文裏邊咧，我哋可以考慮，譬如用protocol啦，或者係其他嘅方式啦，亦都會誒成為咗嗰個誒嗰個附屬法例嗰個法令嘅裏邊咧，我哋都會定明翻有關嘅權力咧係來自邊幾條條款。即係點都會某啲地方會寫明在。

269
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,630
我喺product嗰度，唔該曬。

270
01:04:55,910 --> 01:05:03,300
啊，咁各位委員，有冇一啲就政策上或者原則性上嘅問題，有啲乜嘢嘅提問咧？

271
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:32,240
啊，法律顧問，你係咪仲有一個提問㗎？嚇，啊請講啊，唔該。係咯，謝主席。誒，就嗰個法律專業保密權嗰方面咧，頭先政府當局就引述咗誒誒第一二章嘅五十一大誒四大A款啦。

272
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:52,570
誒咁嗰度，我留意到個寫法咧，就可能睇表面上好似比比較窄啲嘅。佢點寫咧就係話不得規定大律師或律師披露其以大律師或律師身份而獲提供或獲給予的享有特權資料或通訊。咁即係話，如果啲嗰啲誒有特權嘅資料喺個客身上咧。

273
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:56,570
你就唔可以依靠呢條啦，你就要畀㗎啦，你哋冇都唔畀㗎，係咪咩意思啊？

274
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:17,430
誒，我想補充咧，就係話誒，除咗頭先我引述税務條例嘅第五十一四A呢度係關乎嗰個法律誒，如果律師或者誒大律師佢披露資料嘅嗰方面嘅規定之外咧，其實就喺嗰個嘅經合組織就著個誒資料交換個協定範本裏邊咧，都有一條嘅條款咧。

275
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:37,440
係清楚定明咧，誒雙方嘅主管當局咧，如果有關嘅資料係涉及一啲法律嘅專業保障嘅權利嘅一啲嘅範圍涵蓋範圍咧，都不得作資料交換嘅。而依個有關嘅條款咧，我哋亦都會咧係打算係誒跟循同埋依據嚟將佢咧係包攬咗喺我哋日後嗰個。

276
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,330
嘅協定嘅條文裏邊嘅。

277
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:47,420
你哋有冇一個即係如果Tear嘅範本，即係香港想用嘅範本，可以畀到我哋睇咧？其實有冇喺現在？

278
01:06:47,800 --> 01:07:07,810
係，主席，誒，我哋可以喺會後提供翻咧依個經合組織佢嗰個所謂個範本啦。咁當然喺香港嚟講咧，我哋而家未去到傾到嗰啲細節嘅。咁一般咧，我哋都會係以嗰個做一個大體嘅基礎。誒，而後咧，我哋係會再同有關嘅方面真係要做到嗰個談判嘅。

279
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:23,280
時候咧，我哋雙方都係可以作出一啲修訂嘅。咁但係啲大原則我哋會依據，噉我哋可以喺會後提供。係唔該曬。誒噉，秘書長，我係有一個問題嘅。比如話你而家講緊啲誒legally professional privilege嘅文件。

280
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:43,570
咁而家你講緊即係你頭先已經同啊法律顧問都解釋咗啦。如果嗰個文件係寫住本身係legally professional privilege嘅文件，無論喺佢喺律師嘅手上好，或者喺個啊taxpayer嘅手上都好咧，你哋都唔會誒要求佢披露嘅，係咪噉樣樣啊？

281
01:07:43,570 --> 01:08:03,580
即係趙局長，可唔可以補充？主席據我嘅理解，呢個所謂專業嘅特權咧，係適用於律師同大律師同佢嘅客户之間嘅通訊嘅。係換句講，呢個特權咧係屬於納税人嘅，所以喺税務局嘅立場喺執行個法税法嘅時候咧，無論個資料係喺律師或者係當。

282
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,200
都由當事人去決定，佢需唔需要行使呢個特權嘅？

283
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:28,570
即係根據嗰份文件嗰個nature去決定，而唔係嗰個份文件喺邊個人嘅控制嘅手上，係咪咧？係。主席簡單嚟講，如果有訴訟啦，嗰份文文件同訴訟有關啦，或者就一啲法律嘅問題去解釋嘅，税務局都會認同咧有呢個特權存在嘅。好，唔該。

284
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:29,360
蔡國長。

285
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:49,820
嗱喺我哋誒進入條文逐條審議之前，我再畀多幾分鐘大家去去思量下諗諗，仲有冇一啲嘅問題？或者我我提議大概畀誒大家五分鐘一個少少嘅小休喺五分鐘之後咧，我哋會誒正式。

286
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:55,410
進入呢個條文嘅誒逐條嘅審議階段，我畀多五分鐘大家嚇。
