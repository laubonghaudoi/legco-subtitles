1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
今年，香港藝術發展局修訂條例草案。

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:20,470
本會現在恢復二零一三年税務修訂條例草案二讀辯論，審議條例草案嘅委員會主席梁繼昌議員會就委員會嘅報告向本會發言，梁繼昌議員。

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,960
主席。

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,210
在 my capacity of chairman of the Bills Committee on Inland Revenue Amendment Bill Two Hundred and One Three。

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,950
我 wish to report on the work of the Bills Committee.

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,110
我將聚焦於主要議題，由法案委員會考慮。

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:51,750
The main objects of the bills are first to put in place a legal framework for Hong Kong, to enter into tax information exchange agreements with other jurisdictions.

8
00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:01,600
and secondly, to enhance the existing exchange of information arrangements under comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements.

9
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,520
In respect of tax types and limitation on information disclosure.

10
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:16,910
The purpose for introducing the changes is to meet the latest international standard for exchange of tax information.

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:35,120
bills committee generally supports the proposals in the bill in view of the importance of Hong Kong to maintain its reputation as an international business and financial centre, committed to upholding tax transparency and combating tax evasion.

12
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:42,600
and to be able to pursue comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements successfully with trading partners.

13
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,580
在course of deliberations.

14
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:55,530
成員們有然而表達了關心，關於放寬限制信息披露的範圍。

15
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,600
The possible additional burden on taxpayers in respect of retention.

16
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,150
和Reporting of tax information.

17
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:11,560
The adequacy of the safeguards for protecting taxpayers' privacy and confidentiality of tax information exchanged.

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,850
The oversight and scrutiny of the administration's compliance with the disclosure procedures.

19
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,960
as far as the use of tax information for non-tax related purposes.

20
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,380
One major proposal of the bill, Mr. President.

21
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:45,680
是 to allow the commissioner of inland revenue to disclose tax information generated prior to the effective date of the relevant comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement, or, if applicable, the tax information exchange agreement.

22
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:59,090
如果他滿意，那信息關乎執行有關協議的條款，或税法的管理或執行，於申請國的領土。

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,820
在 respect of any period that starts after the date on which the relevant agreement comes into operation.

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,650
although the administration has advised that the existing record keeping requirements under the inland revenue ordinance

25
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,530
which stipulate a seven-year period for the retention of business and rent records， will remain unchanged.

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:39,590
Some members of the Bills Committee are concerned that the proposal will allow a requesting tax authority to ask for information generated more than seven years before the relevant agreement comes into operation.

27
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,620
它被建議，先生，行政應設定一個時間限制。

28
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,430
on the period for which provision of retrospective information will be considered.

29
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:02,690
或 expressly confine such disclosure only to information that is necessary and direct for a specified purpose.

30
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,260
The administration.

31
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,560
In response to this demand, has explained that.

32
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,550
under both comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements.

33
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,340
和税信息交換協議。

34
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,750
requests for exchange of information have to meet a standard of foreseeable relevance.

35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,400
which is a safeguard against fishing expeditions.

36
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,910
In addition, under the Inland Revenue Disclosure of Information Rules.

37
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,490
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue will not entertain a request for information exchange.

38
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,780
unless he is satisfied.

39
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,270
Upon the examination of the particulars provided by the requesting partner.

40
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,970
that the standard of foreseeable relevance.

41
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,900
Among other criteria, is met.

42
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:02,260
The administration has advised that, as far as the standard of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is concerned.

43
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,800
The formulation.

44
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,770
foreseeable relevant has been adopted to mean necessary and relevant.

45
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,780
Furthermore, even when the inland revenue department acts on a valid exchange of information request.

46
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,140
and exercises its information gathering power to approach a person for the relevant information.

47
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,960
The person has no obligation to provide to the department.

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,780
for exchange of information purposes.

49
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,250
信息，which is not in his possession or control.

50
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,830
and is not required to be capped.

51
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,040
或Beyond the statutory retention period.

52
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,290
under the inland revenue ordinance.

53
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:56,110
因此，行政考慮到沒有需要設置時間限制於提供回溯性資訊的期間，於兩項協議下。

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,090
成員們對法案委員會也關心有關在法案下要設立的保障。

55
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,650
和未來税信息交換協議。

56
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,290
to ensure that taxpayers' privacy and confidentiality of information exchanged.

57
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,470
都 duly protected。

58
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,720
The inland revenue department will not release information for inappropriate reasons.

59
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,900
The administration has advised that.

60
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,410
After the legal framework for tax information exchange agreements is in place.

61
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:40,180
In order to afford legal protection to taxpayers in terms of privacy and confidentiality of information exchanged.

62
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,730
它將跟隨現行的策略，即全面避免雙重課税協議。

63
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:54,390
to strive to provide relevant safeguards in the text of their relevant tax information exchange agreement.

64
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,210
這些 safeguards將包括， among others。

65
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,020
to exchange information only upon request.

66
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,080
Only to disclose information which is foreseeably relevant.

67
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,320
to treat information received as confidential.

68
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,600
not to disclose information requests to a third jurisdiction, etc.

69
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:28,550
The administration has assured the Bills Committee that each comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement, or tax information exchange agreement signed.

70
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:37,050
將會被實施作為國內的補助性立法，受立法會否決的影響。

71
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,540
The existing inland revenue disclosure of information rules.

72
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,760
Providing for domestic statutory safeguards in addition to those provided in individual agreements.

73
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Will be extended and become applicable to exchange of information under both agreements.

74
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,710
Some members also raised concerns, in particular.

75
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,770
on the disclosure of information subject to legal professional privilege.

76
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:18,900
The administration has advised that there is no obligation on a contracting party of either of the two agreements to supply information covered by legal professional privilege.

77
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,410
The restriction on disclosure of legally privileged materials.

78
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,400
是 legally binding on the inland revenue department.

79
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,740
Furthermore.

80
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:43,510
It is stated in the commentary on the exchange of information article of the OECD Model Tax Convention that a requested jurisdiction may decline to disclose information.

81
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,010
relating to confidential communications between attorneys.

82
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,670
solicitors.

83
00:08:49,230 --> 00:09:01,120
或其他委任律師代表的職務，作為其，和客户，至於程度，該通訊受到國內法保護，不公開。

84
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,930
在處理税payer的appeals和資訊披露。

85
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,260
法案委員會Notes，那《內地税收披露資訊規則》。

86
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,040
has put in place a notification and reveal system.

87
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,060
在處理交換資訊要求及相關Appeals。

88
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,490
例如，作為一個納税人提出異議的程序。

89
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:37,690
to the disclosure of or or part of the information that the commissioner of inland revenue is prepared to disclose to the requesting partner.

90
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,310
There was a suggestion that the administration should should put in place.

91
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,460
An independent oversight body.

92
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,290
to ensure that the inland revenue department will deal with individual requests.

93
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,160
以一個fair and consistent manner。

94
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,040
and that the actions taken and decisions made by the department.

95
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,290
會嚴格 adhere to internal procedures and guidelines.

96
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,310
on this issue.

97
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:24,010
The administration has explained to the Bills Committee that whether or not Hong Kong can pass OECD's evaluation on its compliance with the latest international standard for exchange of information in September this year.

98
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:31,560
將 largely hinge on the availability of a legal framework for tax information exchange agreements.

99
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,930
It is therefore critical to proceed with the proposals of the bill.

100
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,560
to put in place such a legal framework in a timely manner.

101
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:50,540
since the suggestion to set up an independent oversight body to monitor the inland revenue department's compliance with the disclosure procedures.

102
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,770
會 lead to some structural changes to the existing system.

103
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,810
The administration considers it premature to take it forward.

104
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,880
In parallel with the proposals in the bill.

105
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,460
Without gauging the views of the concerned parties and the public.

106
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,050
它將然而尋求改善對程序遵守的監察，在長遠。

107
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,910
the bills committee notes that to abide by a new requirement of OECD.

108
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:35,860
The administration is prepared to allow future contracting parties of comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements to use the information exchanged for non-tax related purposes.

109
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,950
This does not involve, Mr. President, any amendments to the Inland Revenue Ordinance in the current legislative exercise.

110
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,470
The non-tax-related purposes for tax information exchange.

111
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,710
Are to be governed by the terms of the relevant agreements.

112
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:03,030
The administration has explained that under the latest version of the OECD exchange of information article.

113
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,830
非税相關目的，必須是目的，為税信息交換。

114
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,330
may be so used under the laws of both parties to the relevant agreement.

115
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,920
和使用的資訊交換，for such purposes.

116
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,080
must have the prior authorisation of the competent authority of the supplying party.

117
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:38,520
Moreover, OECD only allows the sharing of tax information by the tax authorities of the receiving party with other law enforcement agencies.

118
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,040
和司法權力在那個管轄區。

119
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,000
On certain high priority matters.

120
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,600
for example, to combat money laundering, corruption, and terrorism financing.

121
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,680
The privacy commissioner for personal data has expressed concern that the use of tax information exchange.

122
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:17,940
Under the comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements for non-tax related purposes, may not be entirely consistent with the existing exemption provisions in respect of prevention and detection of crime under the personal data privacy ordinance.

123
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:30,770
The administration has explained that, on every future occasion of intended use of tax information, for specified non-tax related purposes.

124
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,770
The Inland Revenue Department will not consent.

125
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,940
我強調，將不會同意，通過請求一個承諾方。

126
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,120
如果相關政府部門在香港 raise objection。

127
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:55,000
或如果such use of information is not covered by the current exemption as provided under Section 58 of the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance,

128
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:05,060
In relation to crime under the laws of a place outside Hong Kong, with which Hong Kong has in place legal or law enforcement cooperation.

129
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,830
The administration has advised that, under the laws of Hong Kong.

130
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,950
Tax information may only be used for limited non-tax related purposes.

131
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,970
such as recovery of proceeds from drug trafficking.

132
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,500
organised and serious crimes and terrorist acts.

133
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,270
The administration has assured members that.

134
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,300
在簽訂新全面避免雙重税收協定的未來。

135
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,410
它將不會輕易地否認最新版本的資訊交換條款。

136
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:50,250
unless both jurisdictions have similar legislation on use of tax information for non-tax related purposes.

137
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,970
Together with law enforcement cooperation arrangement in place between them.

138
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,900
Mr. President.

139
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,100
法案委員會支持第二讀的法案。

140
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:08,440
Neither the administration nor the Bills Committee will move any committee stage amendments.

141
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,770
The following part of the speech carries my personal comments on the bill.

142
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,040
作為 personal observation。

143
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,980
The bill enables Hong Kong to comply with the bare minimum of the latest exchange of information standard.

144
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,960
It does not put Hong Kong at the forefront of international tax cooperation initiatives.

145
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:41,270
作為一萬二百二十成員的全球透明度與資訊交換與税務目的的國際組織。

146
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,090
香港是唯一沒有法律框架進入兩 tiers。

147
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,630
香港是經過兩階段的雙向審查，由全球論壇。

148
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,690
which evaluates jurisdictions compliance with the international exchange of information standard.

149
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,600
Phase one of the peer review, Mr. President, was completed in October 2011.

150
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,360
在December 2012，The Global Forum launched a phase two peer review on Hong Kong.

151
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,720
which evaluates Hong Kong's implementation of the exchange of information standard in practice.

152
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,560
and examines whether Hong Kong has taken forward the recommendations proposed by the Global Forum during the phase one peer review process.

153
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,890
如果香港fails the phase two peer review,

154
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,860
香港 may run the risk of being labelled as an uncooperative jurisdiction.

155
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,880
which will be damaging to our position.

156
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,470
作為國際金融中心。

157
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,450
In addition.

158
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,460
其他 jurisiction may also impose unilateral sanctions on Hong Kong.

159
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:06,730
It is therefore critical for Hong Kong to have in place the legal framework for the tiers now, before the Global Forum finishes the phase two peer review in September 2013.

160
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:23,610
先生，我已審視了安全措施，已提出要實施於法案，或任何未來協議，以維護機密性質，並防止將受法律專業保護的資訊，傳遞給第三方國家。

161
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,470
The safeguards, in my views, are at par with international standard and practice.

162
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,730
on 18th of June, 2013.

163
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,580
The leaders of G8, Mackinac Island and North Island.

164
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,240
One of the achievements of the meeting.

165
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,260
Was a commitment by the leading economies to shake up international corporate tax rules.

166
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:55,860
The ten-point lock-on declaration calls for tax authorities to share information automatically.

167
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:06,260
它也敦促國家改變那讓多國企業將利潤跨國度轉移以避税的規則。

168
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,230
and require them to report what tax they pay where.

169
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,010
香港 may not be subscribing to these principles yet.

170
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:22,650
但係，會唔會係香港的長遠利益，要被標榜為一個不合作的司法管轄區？

171
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:30,900
或一 jurisiction， which attracts business， due to its secrecy rules and opaque business and tax regime.

172
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,960
such types of offshore havens， will soon have no place on earth.

173
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
In conclusion, Mr. President.

174
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,670
since the policy direction of the bill is clear and equitable.

175
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,980
and it is fairly and reasonably draft.

176
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,840
I would urge my honourable colleagues in this chamber from across the parties to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,790
呢位議員。

178
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:21,440
主席，二零零八年金融海嘯之後，好多西方國家咧都面臨嚴重嘅財政赤字，佢哋千方百計增加財政收入，而不斷提高税務交換資料嘅廣度同深度咧，肯定係方向之一。大家都記得零九年四月咧喺倫敦峯會上邊咧，二十國集團同意打擊避税天堂。

179
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:42,020
o e c d隨即公佈三種名單，即係黑名單、灰名單同埋白名單。當時咧，法國曾經要求將香港同埋澳門列入作灰名單，即係代表呢個地區咧屬於打擊避税不足地區。消息傳出咧，引起好大嘅震動，因為香港作為國際金融中心、啊貿易同埋航運。

180
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,140
中心一旦被列為灰名單咧，會產生。

181
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,850
嚴重嘅後遺症。

182
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,110
後來咧，透過中央政府嘅協助，極力阻止。

183
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,880
本港被列入灰名單，結果咧。

184
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:15,180
係有一啲其他嘅地方咧，被染灰，而本港咧就避免跌入灰名單。香港咧亦都爭取到寶貴嘅時間咧，修改相關嘅法例，回應國際社會嘅關注。喺二零一零年，政府修訂咗税務條例，令到經合組織税收協定版本二零零四年版本中。

185
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:35,240
有關資料交換嘅條文咧，得以喺香港落實。實際上咧，就係讓税務局咧可以因應全面性協定夥伴提出嘅要求，收集同埋披露某啲納税人嘅資料，即使有關資料咧並不關乎本地税務事。呢個做法咧，同國際標準接軌，而香港政府嘅努力咧，亦都得到。

186
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:55,250
國際社會嘅認同。二零一一年十月喺經合組織有關税務透明化同埋有效資料交換嘅全球論壇上咧，通過咗香港嘅評估報告，對香港提致力提高税務透明度嘅工作咧係予以肯定。而喺法例修訂之後咧，香港亦都採用。

187
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:15,260
咗國際性嘅資料交換準則，對擴大本港全面性被免雙重課税協定網絡咧，有好大幫助。至今咧，香港已經簽咗，據我瞭解係二十九份全面性嘅協定。而喺二零一零年咧法例修訂之前咧，其實香港只係簽訂咗五份嘅協定。

188
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:24,500
到咗最近咧，G八元首喺不愛爾蘭召開峯會嘅時候咧，與會者其中一項共識咧，就係要聯手打擊。

189
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:44,820
係跨境逃税或者跨境避税，同時促請各國修改法例，令到而家屬於合法嘅避税行為咧都有機會變成非法。雖然喺峯會裏邊提出好多措施都未列出具體細節，不過咧外界預計咧九月起聖彼得堡舉行嘅G二十峯會咧，或者會簽署正式協。

190
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,770
所以咧。

191
00:21:46,050 --> 00:22:06,060
估計打擊避税天堂嘅工作咧會陸續推展。今次政府提出税務條例嘅修訂咧，係避免誒將香港列入為避税天堂名單嘅第二波工作，因因為咧最新嘅資料交換國際標準裏邊咧係要求一個税務管核區同其他税務管核區咧應該。

192
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,510
同同時具備全面性協定同埋交換協定兩種資料。

193
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:32,950
嘅交換工具，針對呢個標準咧，喺全球論壇將喺今年九月咧再進行第二階段嘅評估，所以咧喺而家完成協定嘅法定法律框架咧係十分重要。可以預計咧，國際社會對於税務資料交換咧，只會不斷提高要求，亦都不斷收緊。

194
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:52,960
平核嘅準則，相信香港咧日後咧都會面對一輪又一輪嘅平核。而民建聯嘅立場係誒支持最低度嘅修訂，以符合資料交換嘅制度，令到香港能夠喺通過不同階段嘅評估，避免受到避税天堂嘅指控。主席喺過去多次相關討論嘅誒。

195
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,320
而相關討論裏邊咧，議員基本嘅立場都係相同嘅，就係喺税務資料交換呢個問題上咧，我哋。

196
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:16,150
誒係唔需要超英趕美喺國際社會嘅要求底下咧，香港呢一個細小而開放嘅經濟體，誒只需要咧係不只係只需要喺最後嘅階段咧，符合最低嘅要求，避免跌入避税天堂嘅名單當中，噉。

197
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:32,870
背後嘅理據當然大家都理解啦，因為香港税率低、税種少，資料制度嘅誒框架底下咧，相信咧係香港企業咧係誒會係不斷被要求咧係提供資料，而香港可能向

198
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,200
外要求提供資料嘅機會咧，係相對少嘅。

199
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:50,550
主席，所以民建聯咧係認同今次政府提出嘅修訂建議，亦都認為咧係符合最低嘅規定嘅要求。咁包括當局咧係考慮到對有關追索性嘅評估同埋海外税務調查嘅誒。

200
00:23:51,890 --> 00:24:05,400
税務資料嘅要求等等，咁另外政府都承諾咧，只會根據國際協定嘅條文同埋香港嘅法例咧，披露所要求嘅有關資料。面對國際社會對提高税務

201
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:25,690
透明度、防止同埋打擊避税嘅期望越嚟越高咧。香港社會，尤其是商界同埋中小企咧，其實都要提高警覺，亦都要有心理準備，因為喺好多國家眼裏邊咧，我哋香港都成日被定性為或者被認為係避税天堂。呢個背後嘅想法咧有兩大理由。第一咧就係香港。

202
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,070
單獨執行。

203
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,060
誒地域管制。

204
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,870
地域管轄權只對香港境內個人收益同埋企業利潤徵實徵税。

205
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,890
內地對外，對於外商投資，有一隻咧實行，有一有一係列嘅免税政策。

206
00:24:44,600 --> 00:25:04,610
以致咧，如果有香港公司嘅利潤主要係喺境外產生，好容易咧就形成咗雙重免税。第二咧就係香港税項較少啦，税税率較低，企業所得税咧亦都較其他國家低，加上香港唔使收利息税啦、資本增值税或者遺產税等，咁亦都容易咧引起大量外。

207
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:12,010
國嘅資金流入，所以咧為咗避免香港社會成為國際啊社會嘅眼中釘，或者被認為不。

208
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:21,390
誒被視作不合作嘅税務管轄區咧，我哋係有需要修改法例配合國際税務標準嘅基本要求。

209
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:41,790
既然香港要履行國際社會嘅責任，配合國際税務嘅標準，民建聯咧係促請税務局要為我哋納税人咧把好關。對於其他地區提出嘅資料交換要求咧，係取態必須從嚴；只要披露咧，係要求最低限度嘅資料，同時咧確保交換嘅資料咧。

210
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:57,070
只向有關當局披露，而保障咧納税人嘅利益，而回應咧企業嘅擔心。最後咧，民建聯係誒支持今日嘅修訂法例。咁考慮到政府同其他地方簽訂嘅全面性避税雙重。

211
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:07,370
徵税協定咧，更能夠促進香港商業活動嘅措施。我哋促請當局咧喺日後嘅工作重點咧，係放喺誒擴擴展香港同。

212
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:14,980
同我哋主要貿易同埋投資夥夥伴嘅全面性協定網絡。本人緊接陳志恆主席。善總嘉言。

213
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,870
先生，我會像回歸到我的請求，為一個獨立監察委員會為IRD。

214
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,560
Administration's current proposal does not properly address my concerns.

215
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:38,540
The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, the Global Forum, has recommended reinforce the legal framework to facilitate effective exchange of information.

216
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,010
One of the vital enhancement to the framework would be establishing an independent oversight committee.

217
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:53,510
行政總署的建議擴展內税部使用者委員會的範圍是不滿意的。

218
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:12,820
The users' committees would have limited access or exposure to information, since the IRD would provide all the reports, the breakdowns by the types of information requested, etc. to the committee. A flaw in this system is that the IRD would control all information distributed to the users' committees.

219
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:23,780
另一個 discrepancy 是，that the users committees would not deal with the confidential information and would not have no role in conducting reviews on individual cases.

220
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:36,470
I fully support protecting taxpayers' privacy and confidentiality of information disclosed in EOI, but it is essential for someone to monitor the information that R&D shares.

221
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:46,390
According to the administration, setting up an independent review panel under the law to monitor the handling of exchange information requests is premature.

222
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:54,040
I disagree. In order to avoid complex scenarios in the future, it is vital that we take early precautions.

223
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:06,000
In order to continuously maintain Hong Kong's reputations as international financial centre, we must strengthen the framework by constantly filtering and monitoring the systems in place.

224
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:16,100
Creating an independent oversight committee would ensure the IRD would deal with the individuals' OI's requests in a fair and consistent manner.

225
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:23,880
And all that actions taken and decisions made strictly adhere to the internal procedures and guidelines.

226
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:32,750
utilising an independent oversight committee has several advantages. It is generally much more cost-effective compared with the forming of.

227
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,570
performing and implementing something later.

228
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,530
also，since experts are involved。

229
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,320
An informed bias is kept to a minimum.

230
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,780
The independent oversight committee can also operate a meeting as a.

231
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,500
as an as an internal check between the IRD and the public.

232
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:06,890
It is the role the committee can help the public understand technically complex issues by publishing reports that committee that communicate the facts in ways the public can understand.

233
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,640
現有的。

234
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,040
The existence.

235
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,720
of an independent oversight committees can have impact on the quality of fairness and fact finding.

236
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,660
even before the committee gains access to relevant information.

237
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,860
When research is done in the knowledge that outside utilities,

238
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:34,540
outside and that an outside entity will be reviewing the research methods and findings. There's an increased sense of accountability.

239
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:52,780
Government or corporate research entities must ensure the standard of the work is acceptable, especially because in the long run it will be more costly and time-consuming if they are forced to go back and correct mistakes. When the independent oversight committee detects and

240
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,650
errors or deceptions.

241
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:02,130
作為過去成員的Operations Review Committees of the ICAC，我理解如何一個獨立的監察委員會應該運作。

242
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,470
The ICC OLC reviews every complaint made and cases investigated by ICC.

243
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,770
irrespective of the size and severity of the crime.

244
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:19,180
成員們，

245
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,740
No investigation can be terminated with ORC consent.

246
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,780
This successful relationship between Rousey and ICA has enhanced the.

247
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,650
productivity of ISAC.

248
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,020
Why wouldn't RLD would form such a committee similar to VRC?

249
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:52,480
President, I sincerely hope that the administration sees the necessity of forming such committees. Furthermore, the Security and Futures Commissions also have a similar set up. The SFC has a process review panel. I hereby urge the government to look into the matter. Thank you.

250
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,070
有冇其他委員要發言？

251
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:15,920
如果冇咧，我現在請財經事務及副務局局長發言答辯咧。局長答辯之後，辯論即告結束。局長，誒主席，首先我要感謝二零一三年税務修訂誒。

252
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,730
條例草案，下稱條例草案。

253
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:30,300
法案委員會主席梁繼昌議員、副主席陳建波議員，各位委員同埋立法會秘書處同事所付出嘅努力，令審議工作咧得以順利完成。

254
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:39,420
我亦要感謝咧各位議員支持條例草案喺今日恢復二讀辯論，並多謝咧李慧瓊議員同埋謝重佳議員剛才發表嘅寶貴意見。

255
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,130
政府當局喺今年四月將條例草案提交立法會審議。

256
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:54,150
法案委員會共召開咗六次會議，並邀請咗業界同埋相關持份者就條例草案表達意見。

257
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,100
條例草案嘅目的係修訂税務條例，讓香港可以。

258
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:15,930
簽訂獨立嘅税務資料交換協定，我下稱交換協定，並優化現行全面性，避免雙重徵税協定，我下稱全面性協定嘅資料交換安排，以符合國際標準。

259
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:36,260
特區政府一直致力與主要貿易及投資夥伴建立全面性協定網絡，為跨境商貿活動提供明確嘅税務安排同埋雙重課税寬免，以促進本港同埋世界各地之間嘅貿易、投資同埋人才互通。

260
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:48,300
截至二零一三年六月底，香港已跟二十九個税務管核區簽訂全面性協定，當中十一個係香港首二十位嘅貿易夥伴。

261
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:58,010
香港作為國際社會中負責任嘅一員，一向致力提高税務透明度，同埋防止逃税活動。

262
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:04,120
所有香港簽訂嘅全面性協定中，均已加入資料交換條文。

263
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,680
國際間對提升税務透明度以防止同埋打擊逃税活動嘅期望越趨殷切。

264
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:24,700
根據經濟合作同埋經濟合作與發展組織税務透明化及有效交換資料全球論壇，我查清全球論壇所述。

265
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:38,270
國際最新嘅資料交換標準係一個税務管轄區必須同時備有全面性協定同埋交換協定呢兩種資料交換工具。

266
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,960
香港現行法例並不容許香港簽訂交換協定。

267
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,080
香港作為全球論壇嘅成員，現正接受成員互。

268
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:58,430
現正接受成員相互評估，藉以檢視香港是否符合國際嘅資料交換標準。

269
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,300
香港第一階段嘅評估已於二零一一年十月完成。

270
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:15,220
按全球論壇所述，香港可否通過第二階段評估，主要決定於是否具備簽訂交換協定嘅法律框架。

271
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,170
假如香港未能通過第二階段評估，

272
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,530
很可能會被國際社會視為不合作嘅税務管轄區。

273
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,190
呢個不但有損香港嘅國際聲譽，亦會削弱香港作為國際。

274
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,410
商業同埋金融中心地位同埋競爭力。

275
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,500
而其他税務管轄區亦有可能對香港作出單方面嘅制裁。

276
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:57,930
鑑於全球論壇將於本年九月審議香港嘅第二階段評估報告，我哋有必要盡快修例，使香港具備簽訂交換協定嘅法律框架，以爭取順利通過第二階段嘅評估。

277
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,040
與此同時。

278
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:20,330
為使我哋日後嘅全面性協定商議工作能夠有所突破，我哋需要透過法例修訂，以便在有必有，以便在有需要時協定下嘅資料交換安排，可涵蓋不同嘅税項種類，以及讓税務局局長喺信納有關請求。

279
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,680
嘅資料。

280
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,290
關乎協定實施後嘅税務評估時。

281
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,830
可披露該等資料。

282
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:36,900
在法案委員會會議上，我哋與委員就如何保障納税人私隱及資料嘅保密性。

283
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,830
以及建議修訂對納税人嘅影響進行咗詳細嘅討論。

284
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,580
我希望喺度總結有關資料交換安排嘅保障。

285
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,010
首先喺條例草案獲得通過後。

286
00:35:52,290 --> 00:36:02,410
政府喺兩種協定下嘅資料交換安排，均會繼續採取現時高度慎密嘅雙重保障措施。

287
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,060
以維護納税人嘅私隱同埋所交換資料嘅保密性。

288
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:17,470
在一方面，我哋會一貫地爭取將有關保障措施納入日後所簽訂嘅協定文本中。

289
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,640
有關保障措施包括只披露可預見相關嘅資料。

290
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,710
所獲取嘅資料必須保密。

291
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:39,470
不得向第三司法管轄區披露資料等，而有關協定會以本地附屬法例嘅形式，經立法會以先訂立後審議嘅程序實施。

292
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:51,310
另一方面，税務豁廕披資料披露規則會適用於日後簽訂嘅協定，作為本地嘅法定保障。

293
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:59,860
有關規則定明，協定夥伴必須在資料請求中再述嘅詳情。

294
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,740
以顯示其請求符合可預見相關嘅標準。

295
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,690
至於條例草案中關乎披露限制嘅建議，

296
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:22,220
正如我哋喺法案委員會會議上清楚表明，我哋無意偏離現行就交換嘅資料施加限制嘅政策。

297
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,620
即向協定夥伴披露嘅資料，必須關乎於。

298
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,520
協定條文。

299
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,960
實施以後嘅任何期間。

300
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,870
我哋建議。

301
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:47,510
微調現行嘅披露限制，目的係容許在有關協定實施前產生嘅資料，也可以進行交換。

302
00:37:47,790 --> 00:38:00,730
但大前提係税務局在審視個協定夥伴在資料交換請求所提供嘅詳情後，認為有關請求符合可預見相關嘅。

303
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:14,780
嘅標準，而所要求嘅資料係關乎於有關協定實施以後嘅任何期間所施行有關協定嘅條文，或執行協定夥伴嘅税務法律。

304
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,580
藉住放寬喺資料交換所涵蓋嘅税項種類。

305
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:30,440
我哋可我哋渴望有更大彈性去遊説主要税務管轄區與香港開展全面性協定嘅商討工作。

306
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,720
喺條例草案獲得通過之後，我哋會實際，我哋實際上會採取正面列載嘅方式。

307
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,390
於每份協定列明所涵蓋嘅税項種類。

308
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:50,400
有關協定將透過立法會嘅先訂立後審議嘅方式實施，成為本地附屬法例。

309
00:38:51,430 --> 00:39:11,440
部分議員同埋代表團體曾就條例草案會否影響納税人嘅責任或法律專業保密權表達關注。我重申，條例草案並無改變現行税務條例下嘅紀錄備存規定。

310
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:31,880
因此，即使税務局根據一項有效嘅資料交換請求，行使其蒐集資料權力，要求某人提供相關資料，該人亦沒有責任為著資料交換目的而向税務局提供按税務條例。

311
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,450
無需予以備存或超過法定備存時限嘅資料。

312
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:45,240
至於法律專業保密權喺全面性協定同埋交換協定下。

313
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:52,560
嘅其中一項保護保障措施，係替約一方沒有責任提供。

314
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,550
會披露任何貿易、業務、工業、商業或專業秘密。

315
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:06,140
或貿易程序嘅資料，包括法律專業保密權所涵蓋嘅資料。

316
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,820
對有關。

317
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:16,490
就有關對法律專業保密權所涵蓋嘅材料嘅披露限制，對税務局係有法律約束力嘅。

318
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:29,200
喺具體嘅操作層面，現行嘅税務豁免資料披露規則已定有通知同埋複核機制。

319
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:39,250
讓當事人可向税務局局長及財政司司長提出修訂行章披露嘅資料。

320
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:53,040
如任何人士因任何行政決定而感到受屈，可向法院申請司法複核。我哋認為現行機制已平衡各方面嘅因素，例如個人私隱。

321
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,740
資料交換嘅有效實施，同埋國際條約嘅義務。

322
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:07,120
為咗回應法案委員會，有委員就税務局遵從保障措施。

323
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:16,020
嘅關注，我哋樂意擴展現時税務局服務承諾關注委員會嘅職權範圍。

324
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,400
讓有關委員會。

325
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,690
檢視税務局嘅定。

326
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:29,520
誒檢視税務局定期提供關於資料交換請求嘅服務，以及處理上訴嘅情情況。

327
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:46,060
具體嚟講，税務局會定期向服務承諾關注委員會報告其資料交換嘅表現，例如接獲資料交換請求嘅宗數、所要求交換資料嘅細項分類資料、處理狀況。

328
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,510
接獲上訴嘅個案數目，以及有關人士提出嘅投訴數目等。

329
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,810
然而，税務局不會向服務承諾關注委員會披露個別。

330
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,780
資料請求嘅詳情已符合全面性協定或者係交換協定嘅保密條文。

331
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,930
有關條文已實施，成為本地法律。

332
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:20,260
事實上，我哋現時已就資料交換請求設立通知同埋複核機制，讓當事人可以。

333
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:31,970
資料與實資料與事實不符，或與其本人無關為理由，要求税務局局長修訂行章披露嘅資料。

334
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:49,210
如該人仍不滿意，可向財政司司長提出複核嘅要求；如該人仍受仍感受屈，可向立可向法院提出司法複核。有關安排一直行之以有效，亦可以為亦為呢個納税人提供保障。

335
00:42:49,510 --> 00:43:00,400
我哋認為有關擴展税務局服務承諾關注委員會嘅職權嘅建議，以能有助提升對税務局處理資料交換嘅監察。

336
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,460
亦都平衡咗各方面嘅因素，例如資料交換嘅有效實施同埋國際。

337
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,150
條約嘅義務。

338
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:20,650
部分持份者關注到日日後香港所接獲嘅資料交換請求會隨之增加，因而對我哋嘅公共財政資源造成影響。

339
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:38,910
參考咗其他税務管轄區嘅做法，我哋現時嘅構想係考慮向提出請求方收取就索取及獲提供所要求所要求嘅資料所產生嘅非一般成本嘅費用。

340
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,930
而一。

341
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:47,150
判執行本地税務法例法令所產生嘅成本，則由税務局自行承擔。

342
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:53,710
今後喺推展全面性協定或交換協定中嘅工嘅。

343
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:14,630
喺推展全面性協定或交換協定嘅工作時，我哋會一如既往由相關持份者參與其中，包括不時諮詢商界同埋專業界別，透過税務局網頁向公眾公佈即時開展嘅商討工作，喺有需。

344
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:21,610
必要時與個別團體會面，以及定期向税務聯合聯絡小組彙報。

345
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,370
喺未來嘅日子，我哋會繼續爭取擴展香港嘅全面性協定網絡。

346
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,430
與此同時，我哋會因應。

347
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:39,010
一些税務管核區嘅訴求，而與之開展交換協定嘅商討工作。

348
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:50,470
我哋亦會不時檢視已生效嘅協定，以便與協定夥伴嘅主管當局提出任何有關協定實施嘅問題。

349
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:58,650
隨住國際社會對提升税務透明度及多邊合作嘅期望與日俱增。

350
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,580
政府當局將因應在全面性協定。

351
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,520
同埋交換協定框架下所得嘅交換資料經驗。

352
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,190
審視香港嘅資料交換安排。

353
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:25,020
我哋會密切留意二十國集團及經合組織喺推動自動或自發嘅交換税務資料方面嘅發展。

354
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:32,630
鑑於國際標準嘅不斷演變，我哋會繼續與香港持份者保持溝通。

355
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:41,050
探討相關嘅政策同埋法律事宜，以其為香港定立一套可持續發展嘅資料交換模式。

356
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:53,870
主席，總的來説，法案委員會支持條例草案嘅建議，我懇請各位議員支持通過條例草案，讓有關嘅建議可以盡快落實。

357
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,250
主席，我僅此陳辭，多謝。

358
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:06,510
現在我喺提出嘅待決議題係二零一三年税務修訂條例草案予以議讀，現在付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

359
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,870

我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

361
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:32,050

362

363
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,070
有冇委員要發言？
