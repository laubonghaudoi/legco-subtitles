1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:07,160
今日嘅會議過程咧，就係西港島線、南港島線東段同埋觀塘延線。

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,570
建造工程嘅最新進展。

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,490
噉啊！

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,050
立法會。

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,770
文件C.B.一六零四一三一四零一啦。

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,150
零二啦，跟住一四九零嘅一三一四零一同一五二九嘅一三一四零一。

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,740
誒對，依間誒。

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,760
已經提供咗啦。

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:41,280
噉啊，根據咧就五月份嘅報章報道咧，西港島線、南港島線東段同埋觀塘延線項目喺施工階段咧，都出現咗一啲困難嘅情況。

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:51,130
所以咧，我哋今次咧就要求咧政府當局同埋啊，誒港鐵咧嚟誒向我哋彙報一下個情況嘅進展嘅。

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:01:03,470
啊，噉就即係今日就係講啱啱誒，正話我提起嗰三個項目嘅最新進展嘅。噉啊，而家歡迎啊，政府啊代表同埋港鐵代表啊。

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,240
入嚟啊！唔該。

13
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,240
銀根錯底。

14
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,130
嗯。

15
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:28,800
我哋今日就誒歡迎大家。今日我哋誒政府方面嘅代表有誒邱成武副局長啦、潘婷婷副秘書長啦，就誒鄭念太誒助理秘書長啦，就劉家強勞政處長啦，陳志恩先生就誒勞政處。

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:39,090
鐵路拓展處長啦，誒，偉達成先生就係港鐵公司嘅行政總裁啦，周大莊先生就係港鐵嘅工程總監啦。

17
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:52,120
就誒，Mr. Mark Kushner咧就係誒港鐵嘅總經理，西港島線同埋南港島線，跟住又周蘇紅先生就觀塘綫嘅經理。

18
00:02:52,410 --> 00:03:02,250
誒蘇文傑女士就係我哋嘅佢哋嘅誒傳訊副總經理啦，同埋阿李盛基先生嘅做車務總管啊。

19
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,000
噉啊，歡迎各位。

20
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,610
咁餘下時間咧，就交畀啊政府代表啊。

21
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,580
報長。

22
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:30,920
主席，誒今次咧，我哋交畀小組委員會嘅文件咧，係包含咗三個唔同嘅鐵路項目。嗱，我建議今次嘅會議咧，就分三個部分，先討論西港島線，再討論南港島線，最後再討論觀塘延線。每個部分咧，港鐵公司咧會有作大約係五分鐘嘅簡報，咁然後就回答。

23
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,740
議員就嗰個部分嘅項目嘅提問，咁喺港鐵續條嘅新路。

24
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,150
鐵路嘅項目介紹之前咧，我先做一個簡單嘅開場白。

25
00:03:41,570 --> 00:04:01,580
啊！目前西港島線、南港島線東段同埋觀塘延線嘅建造工程咧，係全面咁進行嘅。按照兩鐵合併之後，政府同港鐵公司喺二零零七年所簽訂嘅營運協議，西港島線、南港島線東段同埋觀塘線延線咧，都係屬於現

26
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:21,590
有港鐵公司所擁有嘅鐵路網絡嘅延伸，因此佢哋嘅歸類咧係為之係屬於擁有權嘅項目。而根據擁有權嘅模式咧，港鐵公司咧係會負責該項鐵路項目嘅融資、設計、建造、營運同埋維修，並且擁有各。

27
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,220
該段嘅鐵路嘅。

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:32,640
而根據政府同港鐵公司就呢啲項目所簽訂嘅項目協議咧，港鐵公司係需要盡力咁完成有關鐵路工程嘅項目。

29
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:52,950
政府留意到近日有評論指咧，係同時推展啲誒五條鐵路嘅鐵路路線，即係今次所討論嘅三條嘅鐵路路線項目，加上沙中線同埋廣深港高速鐵路嘅香港段，呢個可能係對港鐵公司嘅承擔能力。

30
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,370
啊！帶嚟好大嘅壓力。

31
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:15,740
誒不過事實上咧，港鐵公司同意承擔新鐵路項目嘅時候咧，係會先做佢哋本身嘅能力嘅評估嘅，包括佢哋嘅人手、技術同埋財務需求嘅分析。當規劃呢啲嘅新嘅鐵路項目嘅時候咧，政府同港鐵公司咧已經係按當時所掌握嘅資料制定。

32
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,860
合理可行嘅施工同埋通車時間表。

33
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,430
但係，正如所有嘅大型工程項目一樣啦。

34
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:43,860
特別係涉及一啲係需要進行相當規模嘅地下基建嘅工程咧，喺施工嘅階段咧，不時都係會遇到各種類型不同嘅困難同埋挑戰，而個別嘅工程合約亦都難免會出現同原來計劃有所偏差嘅情況。呢個喺工程界嚟講咧，係並不罕見㗎。

35
00:05:43,860 --> 00:06:02,070
而因應議員同埋公眾對新鐵路通車時間嘅關注咧，運輸及房屋局亦都要求港鐵公司咧就西港島線、南港島線東段同埋觀塘延線咧嘅進度咧係作出最新嘅評估，並且提交報告，詳細噉樣交代各項嘅工程嘅進展。

36
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:22,480
而政府亦都會繼續監督同埋協助港鐵公司咧，盡快去解決施工上所遇到嘅問題，係積極噉樣跟進，切合公眾嘅期望，以期工程項目咧能夠及早噉樣去進攻。政府亦都會推展呢啲項目嘅經驗，去檢視喺興建新鐵路嘅模式同埋相應。

37
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,210
嘅項目管理安排，使到我哋喺規劃同埋發展新鐵路嘅時候咧，係能夠做得係更加好嘅。

38
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:39,490
主席，或者我請港鐵公司嘅行政總裁作一個簡單嘅發言，然後係請佢哋係啊逐一噉樣去介紹。誒跟住落嚟，誒首先係嘅西港島線嘅投影片。

39
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,780
唔需要啦。

40
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,820
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, honourable members. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear here today.

41
00:06:48,100 --> 00:07:00,110
我們 appreciate that the members of this subcommittee, as well as the travelling public in Hong Kong, would like to have more information on the progress of the new rail lines that MTR is constructing.

42
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:08,520
We have put together updates today on the three railway projects in a more thorough and transparent manner.

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:17,800
this will cover what we have achieved, the challenges that we are facing, and their impact, if any, to the delivery programme.

44
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,950
嗯。

45
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:33,070
作為你會知道，建造地下鐵線在發展和人口稠密的香港地區是非常挑戰性的，而且不可避免地會造成對住在、工作和在施工區域穿行的人的幹擾。

46
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,050
嗯。

47
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:43,720
While we always strive to reduce these impacts as much as possible, we must thank the local communities for their patience and their understanding.

48
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,860
The cooperation of these communities has been essential for the progress of these projects.

49
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,430
We we know that everyone has been looking forward to the early opening of the new rail lines.

50
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,070
Based on the current progress.

51
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:10,150
The West Island line should be in service by the end of this year, although there are still some complications with the Sai Ying Pun station.

52
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:25,220
However, I'm sorry to say that due to delays of about six months at Admiralty and at Wampow, communities along the South Island line and the Kuntong line extension will have to wait longer for rail service at the door.

53
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:35,240
我，

54
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:50,050
I also want to assure the committee that we will work very hard to clear up and return occupied sites to the community, and we expect most of these sites to be cleared in line with the original programme.

55
00:08:50,890 --> 00:09:00,900
Now I will hand over first to Mark Cousner, who will take you through in more detail the WIL West Island Line programme. Thank you.

56
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,900
識唔識？

57
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:16,290
The West Island Line is a three-kilometre extension to the existing Island Line with new stations at Sai Yim Pung, HKU and Kennedy Town.

58
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:24,520
我會討論進展狀態的項目在四個關鍵領域。這些是站台、軌道和列車的準備。

59
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:32,680
The presentation will show that the project is on target for opening in December 2014, but with some challenges remaining at Saiyung.

60
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:48,860
在 terms of trackside and tunnel readiness, all trackside installation works have been completed. Train testing between WIL and existing island line has been in progress since May this year and is on target to be completed by August.

61
00:09:50,450 --> 00:10:03,510
肯尼迪鎮站的結構works已經完成，and ENM和建築fitoutworks都進度良好。FSD檢查對於這站是計劃於2014年7月。

62
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,890
HKU station structure works are complete, and the E and M and architectural fitout works are in progress.

63
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,970
installation works are in progress for the high capacity lifts and the connection to the University of Hong Kong.

64
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,530
FSD inspection for this station is planned for September.

65
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,070
在西貢站，仍 remain some challenges， and I will go into detail over the next few slides.

66
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,590
First, it should be noted that for safety reasons.

67
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:46,830
包括 evacuation and ventilation requirements， all three entrances， namely A， B and C， but not including B3， are required to enable the station to open.

68
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,460
所有三 entrances are also required to avoid congestion when operating the station.

69
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,610
With respect to B3, due to difficulties with the ground freezing works.

70
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:05,300
This entrance will open in the fourth quarter of 2015, but this will not have any impact on the opening of WIL this year.

71
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:16,320
for the main body of Sai Ying Pun station, the structural works are complete, and E and M and architectural fit out works are in progress.

72
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,230
FSD inspection is planned for November this year.

73
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,400
entrance B1, B2 and C， the structural works are still in progress.

74
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:46,260
B1、B2，的works have been delayed by difficult ground conditions and the challenges of carrying out the works on a small site close to buildings that are very sensitive to movement. Safety and minimising disturbance to residents has been kept as a key priority.

75
00:11:46,850 --> 00:12:00,080
The B1 B2 structural works will continue until the third quarter of this year, and this means that the programme to complete the fitout works, including the lift installation, will run until late in the year with no buffer in the programme.

76
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,990
作為 prudent measure，一backup plan is being prepared in the event that the works at Sai Yim Poon cannot be completed in time.

77
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:15,560
In this event, HKU and Kennedy Town stations will open for passenger services in December this year, and the trains will not stop at Sai Ying Pun.

78
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,160
喺呢個事件，沙燕綫站將會喺2015年第一季開通。

79
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:30,460
在terms of operations readiness， preparations are progressing well and are on target for WIL opening in December this year.

80
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,340
The group station control room at Kennedy Town Station is now being commissioned.

81
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,270
Testing and commissioning of railway systems is also in progress at Kennedy Town and HKU stations.

82
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,960
mobilisation and training of operation staff has been in progress since early this year.

83
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:58,980
這總結方案顯示，有啲緩衝期供列車測試活動，列車會在二零一四年十二月準備開跑。

84
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,930
Kennedy Town and HKU Station will be ready for trial operations in October and opening for service in December.

85
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:18,720
works at Sai Yim Pung are also on target for completion in line with the December 2014 opening, but there is no buffer in the programme for the remaining works at some of the entrances.

86
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,880
In conclusion.

87
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,210
西島線是按目標於二零一四年十二月開幕。

88
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:35,760
在事件，那西營盤站是 not ready for opening， we will implement a backup plan to open HKU and Kennedy Town stations without西營盤站。

89
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,990
在事件，那的備用計劃是不實行。

90
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,770
The opening of WIL will be in the first quarter of 2015.

91
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,980
final confirmation of the opening arrangements will be given in October this year.

92
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,340
thank you。

93
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,530
Next.

94
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,300
Someone wants to talk about the Southern Island line, or you want to go through all the lines first?

95
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,080
係，冇咗。

96
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,550
路線先，等等啲誒議員集中走西港島線嘅之後，我哋再去南港島線。

97
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,850
誒，各位議員，你哋想一次過聽曬佢哋三條線一齊問，定係逐個逐個？

98
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,350
做調理啊嘛！

99
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:44,030
因為如果唔係我控，如果唔係我控制發言時間，可能有啲問題嘅喎。係啊，因為因為三條線咧誒出現嘅一啲問題咧，其實都好多共通點嘅。咁即係如果我哋八個每人五分鐘，但係如果五分鐘成三個項目，我哋搞唔掂喎。我諗不如講埋啦。O K，誒，如果如果主席你講。

100
00:14:44,030 --> 00:15:00,400
都係咁安排好啲，我誒我諗港鐵都可以繼續誒將南廣島線嘅東段同埋係觀塘綫線都講埋。

101
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,170
Mr. Chairman, that's fine. We're happy to do that.

102
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,450
Mr. Kersner, continue with the South Island line. Thank you.

103
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:25,370
South Island Line is a medium capacity railway that will interchange with the existing Island Line and Chun Wan Line at Admiralty, and run to Ap Lei Chau via new stations at Ocean Park, Wong Chuk Hang, Lei Tung, and with a terminus station at South Horizons.

104
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,720
總路長約七公里。

105
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:37,180
我將更新項目進展，分三部分，即係南方環線、北方環線，以及最後是海軍基地。

106
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,340
First, at South Horizon Station, the excavation works have been completed, and structural works are already in progress.

107
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:57,390
在樂城站，的結構在軌道層已經完成，而車站拱頂結構正在施工於大堂層。

108
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,500
The mainline tunnel at Plachow has been excavated and lined, and the track construction is in progress.

109
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:19,120
The structural works for Ocean Park and Wong Chuk Hang stations and the adjacent viaducts have been completed, and E and M and architectural fit out works are in progress at all these locations.

110
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:27,590
在旺角行 Depot，的結構works也已經完成，而軌道安裝也進度良好。

111
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,850
Works trains have been delivered, and track-related installation will start in June.

112
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:46,310
在南豐隧道，2,750米的 required 3,164米的隧道，已挖好，和圍砌工程進行中。

113
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:58,170
The works at Admiralty Station involve an extensive interface with the existing Island Line and Chun Wan Line, as well as the surrounding existing buildings.

114
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:07,590
複雜性 of the works can be seen from the next few slides, as the new works are added against existing Admiralty stations shown here in brown.

115
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,070
First, the new cut and cover section of the Admiralty Station extension is shown in yellow.

116
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,000
And now the the cavern and tunnel section are shown in blue.

117
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:31,580
for the works at Admiralty Station, MTR has adopted a safety-first approach with the emphasis on ensuring no impact to train services or the surrounding structures.

118
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:42,460
in particular, the underpinning beneath the island line, as indicated on the bottom right-hand corner of the slide, has required very complex and difficult engineering works.

119
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,920
This animation will show the complexity of the works required to support the existing Ireland line.

120
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,210
The underpinning zone.

121
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:00,370
你會見coming up shortly， and is shown in pink. and This zone is approximately 50 metres long and 23 metres high.

122
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,670
所以，這係。

123
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,460
underpinning in pink beneath the island line。

124
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,040
The animation.

125
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:25,500
會 show the beam and column structure that is built incrementally beneath the existing structure. As the new structure is built, the in situ granite rock has to be carefully excavated to make way for the new structure.

126
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,550
strict engineering control of the works is maintained, with safety of the railway structure as the prime objective.

127
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:42,380
這工作非常難以完成，和是喺24小時、7天/週的時間表上進行。

128
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:17,790
這些圖片顯示當前進展的基礎工程，其中安裝支持梁已經大幅完成。這在左上角圖片中可見，您可見鋼線結構及基礎梁。在右下角圖片中，可見站房挖掘。

129
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:33,680
finally, these last pictures show the progress at the new cavern and platform tunnels, where the excavation has been completed, and the concrete lining works have commenced.

130
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,660
所以，總結。

131
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:51,250
for the project, works within the southern district are progressing in line with the original schedule. There are challenges at Nam Phong Tunnel and Admiralty Station, and for the latter, the works are about six months behind programme.

132
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,770
Confirmation on the programme to opening will be given at the end of this year when there is more certainty on the progress.

133
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
Thank you.

134
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,570
做乜嘢？

135
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:24,930
James，James，Charles，會講述K.T.E.項目係周生。誒主席誒各位議員啊，我呢度誒簡單介紹下觀塘線延線而家項目嘅進展嚇。觀塘延延線咧係將現有觀塘線咧係由由麻地站咧將佢伸延到呢個黃埔站，中間咧係有呢個誒何文田站嘅係。

136
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:36,800
何文田站咧，係位處喺舊山谷村嗰個位，係鄰近呢個啊七賢道啦。嚇，目前為止咧，我哋個開發已經係做完㗎啦。咁而家車站嘅結構咧，已經完成超過兩成。

137
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:46,610
噉你見到誒，我哋嘅結構已經係去到呢個誒車站大堂嘅呢個底板，噉啊機電嘅呢個誒樓宇誒安裝咧，亦都開始咗。

138
00:20:48,390 --> 00:21:00,050
隧道方面咧，由呢個油麻地去黃埔咧，我哋誒挖掘已經完成超過九成，剩低大概係一百五十米，靠近呢個何文田站嘅隧道，預計喺今年第三季就會完成。

139
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,560
噉你見到我哋嘅隧道內壁咧，已經係陸陸續續咧，就已經係完成嘅啦。

140
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,900
咁喺靠近呢個油麻地站咧，我哋都開始做呢一個鋪軌嘅工程。

141
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,640
我哋而家仲有一個開麥片，大概係仲有一百五十米就會完成㗎啦。

142
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,120
靠近黃埔嗰段隧道咧，而家隧道嗰個內壁咧，亦都係進行緊，而家。

143
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,630
咁亦都見到，我誒剛才講喺靠近油麻地嗰邊嘅鋪軌，亦都開始咗。

144
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:52,620
除咗呢個軌道誒工程之外咧，我哋亦都係有一啲基建工程咧，係誒將附近嘅社區咧係連接埋一齊嘅。呢個係包括一係列嘅誒行人天橋啦、有蓋通道啦，就同埋呢個行人隧道啦，亦都有一個公共嘅運輸嘅一個啊啊車站嘅。

145
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:04,820
目前為止咧，呢個基建工程咧，我哋完成超過咗六成。噉你見到個天橋橫跨出閘道啦，同埋連接愛民村咧，亦都係架設咗誒出嚟㗎啦。

146
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:17,100
黃埔站咧係觀塘延線嘅尾站，係呢個分開呢個東大堂同埋西大堂，而兩個大堂咧中間係會有一個誒月台隧道咧係連接埋一齊嘅。

147
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,770
目前為止咧，我哋嘅開挖工作咧已經完成超過四成。

148
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,390
預計嗰個車站嘅開挖咧，會喺今年年底完成。

149
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:33,180
而當中嗰個月台隧道咧，我哋會喺今年第三季開始開挖，預計預計喺出年第一季咧就會完成嘅，呢個係。

150
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:55,710
西大堂喺位處而家呢個誒德民街同埋紅磡道嘅呢個路口交界啦，基本上咧，我哋整個黃埔站咧都係冇工地嘅，個工地咧係由呢個一係列嘅一個誒交通改道咧，咁嚟安排呢個誒施工誒呢個條件嘅係。

151
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:17,140
我哋喺呢個交通改造裏邊咧，我哋要維持現有嘅行車線嚇。噉啊，呢個亦都係一個東大堂誒嘅誒誒高空誒俯覽圖啦。噉係位處喺德安街同埋船景街嘅交界。我哋整個開畫面咧，我哋會鋪上呢個鐵板咧，係保持地面嗰個啊交通嘅安排嘅係。

152
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:32,660
而我哋喺呢一個開挖面嘅周邊咧，我哋安裝咗超過一千支嘅呢個鋼管裝咧。誒，因為地質問題咧，有啲鋼管裝係去到呢個七十米深嘅，係咁嚟支撐住呢個地面呢個鋼誒呢個鋼板咧，保持地面嗰個行車嘅。

153
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:49,610
因為黃埔嗰個地方就比較狹窄一啲，同埋比較接近民區啦嚇，噉啊，所以喺我哋呢個安裝呢個鋼板裝啊，同埋實施呢個交通改道嗰陣時咧，噉啊，亦都係見到係誒嗰個地方係比較緊鑽一啲嘅。

154
00:23:51,060 --> 00:24:06,420
我哋冚咗呢個鋼板之後咧，我哋整個喺滑仔個鋼板下邊進行嘅。噉啊，呢個空間係比較誒困難少少啦。誒太大型嘅機器我哋都可唔誒，未必可以放啲入裏邊啦嚇。噉啊，主要都係用嗰啲誒細型嘅機器咧，係挖喺呢度開挖嘅。

155
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:26,680
而最大嘅挑戰喺黃埔咧，就係呢個管線咧嚇，因為喺黃埔裏邊係一個比較舊區，咁誒管線係比較多啦，同埋管線亦都有老化嘅現誒嘅嘅嘅情況。咁好多管線咧，我哋都需要將佢替換咗、更新咗，先至可以誒呢個喺現場嗰度承託同埋保護嘅。

156
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:47,670
總括嚟講咧，誒黃埔站咧係整個換誒高層延線咧係最誒有挑戰嘅一個誒部分啦嚇。噉啊，嗰個工程咧係因為牽涉大大浪呢個挖掘嘅工序啦，噉啊，因為路面嘅誒範圍有限啦，噉啊，亦都有一個複雜嘅管線同埋呢個交通改道咧。噉啊，目前為止咧，我哋大概係誒。

157
00:24:47,670 --> 00:25:07,680
誒六個月嘅滯後，噉啊，我哋都會盡量爭取咧誒完成呢一個黃埔站咧誒，係喺出年年底之前咧，係將呢個路面咧恢復咧，係誒而家翻畀社區嘅。我哋估計誒剩低嘅挖掘工就會喺今年之內完成咧，喺今年誒大概第三第四季左右咧，我哋會。

158
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:15,460
會有一個誒一個誒評估咧，係到時會誒對呢個員工咧會個準確嘅一個彙報嘅。唔該，多謝。

159
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,400
Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentations. 好嘅，我哋而家就誒。

160
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,090
我哋開始議員嘅提問咧，連問連答，第一輪五分鐘啊！

161
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,190
同埋噉，我哋第一位係啊黃國軒議員。

162
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,610
主席。

163
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:45,150
作為咧係港島嘅民選議員咧，我對於咧西港島線同埋南港島線咧，都嚴我係表示咧強烈嘅遺憾同埋係不滿嘅。

164
00:25:45,660 --> 00:26:01,780
主席，以往咧就係地鐵咧係畀公眾嘅印象咧係高速準時守信，而家嘅港鐵咧畀公眾嘅印象咧就係延誤拖時同埋背落。

165
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:09,710
曾幾何時咧？港鐵竟然咧係畀公眾咧一個咁負面嘅印象。

166
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:30,110
就係賴皮，一係就賴地硬，一係就賴地冧。咁其實咧，我係質疑咧，港鐵啊，係咪喺合併之後去開展個項工程過高去估計佢哋對工程嘅承擔能力，因此咧。

167
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,660
喺港內，佢嘅各項工程。

168
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:53,950
係擴張過大，承擔能力不足，造成咧而家唔係某項工程延誤，而係所有工程都延誤。其實港鐵係咪認真要反省自己咧？另外，港鐵咧而家喺港外。

169
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,140
即係香港以外，其實亦都。

170
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:17,430
不斷擴張，擴張嘅規模係咪亦都令到港鐵咧根本係承擔唔到咁多工程，但係都夾硬承擔，因此咧造成港內嘅各項工程，無論喺工程規模、技術能力同埋係嗰個速。

171
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:37,440
度其實全部都減慢，呢個係整體嘅原因。我都希望咧，港鐵就此係回答下。另外，政府喺規管港鐵嘅各項工程，其實政府有冇注意到根本佢承擔唔到咁多，而係要做咁多，因此。

172
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:57,450
咪全部都拖慢曬咯！我亦都希望政府回應。具體而言，我認為西營盤站如果未能夠喺預期全部都開通嗰啲出入口，可否部分開通，令到呢一個西港島線係可以及時。

173
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,740
如期通車咧，呢個係具體嘅問題。再者，

174
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:22,030
而家西港島線好，南港島線好都延誤，係唔係港鐵係要承擔曬所有因為延誤所產生嘅額外費用？不應當咧係由呢個市民嚟去承擔嘅。呢啲我希望咧具體啲嘅回應。再者，我亦都。

175
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:36,330
希望咧運防局嘅聽到中西區區議會同埋南區區議會嘅聲音，喺呢一個鐵路開通之後六個月之內，不能夠縮減呢個原先嘅巴士路線。

176
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,420
省政府回應，港鐵回應。

177
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:48,210
我諗啊，主席，或者先港鐵回應咗下啊，我再請路政署講一講嗰個嘅誒監管嘅問題。Mr. Waunder。

178
00:28:50,370 --> 00:29:10,380
Thank you very much for the for the question. I hope you can see from the slides we put forth that the project teams have been working very very hard to be able to deliver these projects. Nevertheless, we are very very sorry to disappoint the community with the delays that we have experienced.

179
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:30,410
我 do believe at the time that the projects were put forth that there was a comprehensive review done in regard to the planning and the capabilities to be able to do that. MTR's presence outside of Hong Kong really has no effect upon this. We have literally only a handful of

180
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:49,380
Project staff outside of Hong Kong. You raised the question about the extra cost of these projects. If there is extra cost, these are projects that are ownership projects to MTR. MTR does bear the risk of construction associated with these projects.

181
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:09,810
Finally, you also raised the question as to whether there was a way to be able to open up WIL Sai Ying Pun Station with fewer entrances. I'd like to turn this over to the the general manager Mark Kusner to respond to that, as it's a question of of safety in in doing that. Mr Kusner, thirty.

182
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,320
啊。

183
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:30,900
just to reiterate, it is the target to open Sai Ying Pun station in December. We're working hard to achieve that. In terms of opening the station with not all the entrances, that that is not possible because of safety considerations in terms of evacuation and also ventilation requirements for the station.

184
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,550
係一。

185
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,970
時間五分鐘，今日就唔係好多人嘅簡短啲啦，啊副局長嚇。

186
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,900
蔣鴻，誒就個監管問題回答下。多謝主席。

187
00:30:44,200 --> 00:31:04,210
就誒，發展處咧就住每一項嘅鐵路項目咧，都即係有進行監管嘅。其實我哋就住每一項嘅項目咧，都係成立咗個專責嘅小組咧，係負責即係監察誒港鐵係進行呢個即係鐵路工程嘅情況。咁即係誒係通過我哋誒誒港鐵提交每個月嘅呢個進度報告咧。

188
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:24,220
我哋亦都會同佢每個月進行呢個會議，啊，聽取呢個即係嗰個進度嘅情況嘅。我哋亦都會實行呢個即係實地嘅視察咧，去睇睇究竟即係現場嘅情況同呢個港鐵提嗰個報告咧有冇即係唔同嘅。啊，噉我哋透過呢啲噉嘅一係列嘅功夫咧嚟係即係監管即係港鐵嗰個。

189
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,070
誒工程個進度嘅，啊多謝主席。好啊，我哋其實仲有機會第二輪㗎嚇，啊鄧家彪二。啊，多謝主席。

190
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,860
啊！多謝多謝主席啊！

191
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:44,060
好多謝，等啊，鄧家彪議員、胡志偉議員、郭貝凡議員、田北辰議員、陳林彬議員、郭偉強議員、盧偉國議員、善仲佳議員。

192
00:31:45,630 --> 00:32:05,640
好開始啦！好，多謝主席。誒，我問嘅問題咧，可能即係闊啲，唔係個別先。其實我留意翻鐵路小組嗰個即係待議事項咧，原本五月二號咧就講未來鐵路發展嘅噉啊，高鐵啦嚇，七跟住延到七月四號，跟住講古跡啦。

193
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:25,650
啊！噉啊，七月四號，而家嗰個會就變咗沙中線嘅會啦。咁未來鐵路發展咧，除非主席同局局開快車，七月開多個特別會。如果唔係咧，暑假翻嚟之後咧，十月或者十一月都唔知有冇得回報。呢一個未來鐵造鐵路發展裏面有其他未能有鐵路覆蓋嘅居。

194
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,140
唔係。

195
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:46,430
同而家西區、南區、啊何文田區嘅居民一樣咁焦急，因為你哋嗰啲區咧就即係工程延誤啦，要等半年一年。咁呢啲好似有着落嘅啊，好似東湧，好似小西灣、北環線嗰批，咁點樣咧？

196
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,230
係咪消失咗咧？

197
00:32:48,510 --> 00:33:05,120
點解會一個明明進行緊嘅研究，話會有個報告會年中五月冇，七月又好似冇，幾時會有咧？個原因係乜嘢咧？咁呢啲即係可能出現嘅新鐵路，係唔係隨住？

198
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:14,850
即係港鐵爆禍，原來五條鐵路都係嚴誤而各自咧，定係你哋而家已經係檢討緊路政處夠唔夠能力？

199
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:23,550
去監管同埋協調港鐵在執行新鐵路項目咧？請局副局回答，唔該。副局長。

200
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:44,940
主席啊，我相信呢個你都清楚嘅。嗯，我哋原本當然係喺誒準備向誒鐵路事小組委員會咧去交代啊新嘅誒鐵路嘅發展啦。咁但係喺過去呢兩個月度咧，誒有關於現行嘅鐵路建造嘅進度咧，就誒。

201
00:33:44,940 --> 00:34:04,950
有唔同程度上嘅問題，或者係有啲係疑問啊噉樣樣咧，係令到社會人士啊或者係議員咧都好關注。噉我覺得誒，首先要回應咗議員喺呢方面嘅關注，誒亦都要解答畀佢哋聽，究竟啊嗰啲嘅鐵路路段、嗰啲嘅滯後啊或者疑問啊個原因係乜嘢？

202
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:24,960
嘅嘢，使到更加清楚知道我哋而家推進鐵路裏邊咧，其實咧都係有各種可能嘅挑戰，或者係裏邊咧嘅風險，或者係可能嘅誒具體嘅困難嘅。噉我覺得將呢啲嘅狀況咧清清楚楚同議員啊同公眾交代咗，噉我覺得誒，然後再。

203
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:44,970
再去睇我哋嘅鐵路跟住落嚟點樣再開展。誒喺呢段時間嘅討論裏邊咧，大家亦都提到關於譬如政府嘅監管嘅角色，或者係誒港鐵公司如果作為一個承建者，佢本身嘅角色、佢個能力等等嘅問題都提出嚟。噉我哋覺得呢啲嘢，我哋都要綜合去。

204
00:34:44,970 --> 00:35:04,980
睇清楚，跟住落嚟應該點樣去推進。所以我相信咧，誒，關於新鐵路本身嗰個嘅誒檢討同埋更新咧，呢樣嘢我哋唔會各自唔會係誒唔同大家交代。我哋稍後咧都會翻翻嚟條事少組裏邊咧向大家交代嘅。咁呢個稍後係等到幾時？

205
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:24,990
先交代咧，會唔會等到可能係即係由退休法官所領導嘅小組出埋報告啊？睇先睇咗先至會交代，定係點樣？定係即係誒當經濟下滑、失業率即係跌個誒升嗰陣時，又畀啲好消息畀大家嗱，又有工程啦。即係乜嘢因素你哋先會交代？

206
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:45,000
佢咧，其實就算你哋公佈呢個未來鐵路發展唔係即刻起啊嘛，其實同現有港鐵負責緊嗰五條鐵路所需要集中精神做好嘅工程，理論上係兩種嘅工作嚟。嗰邊係規劃財務，呢邊係工程，咁點解要拖咧？副局長稍後。

207
00:35:45,000 --> 00:36:05,010
係幾後啊？主席，誒，我哋我哋嘅諗法咧，誒，嗱，我哋之前我哋喺誒同大家講，誒，亦都喺特首本身嗰個司政部裏面都講過，我哋喺今年裏邊咧係會係將我哋嗰個嘅鐵路發展長遠嘅規劃咧係同大家交代嘅。噉我哋原本嘅計劃咧喺年中到，即係主席你都清。

208
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,030
錯啦！當我哋都想交代，不過我哋覺得係要先令到誒目前興建嘅鐵路裏邊咧。

209
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:30,320
講清楚個有關嘅問題，誒而鐵路事小組本身嗰個時間開會時間亦都有一定嘅誒誒限制啦。噉我哋覺得搞清楚之後咧，我哋一定會稍後咧就同大家交代。我哋喺誒，我哋具體時間我哋會啊同主席傾一傾，過我哋跟住安排嘅時間係咩時間會比較恰當嚇。我想問清楚係咪已經寫好？

210
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,420
咗，只不過等幾時出台，定係仲寫緊咧？

211
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:54,710
誒主席，我哋基本上嗰個嘅有關嘅誒文件咧，誒基本上已經係遠避㗎啦嚇。啊，當然啦，有啲個別嘅字眼，啲真相誒可能會再執，亦都唔，亦都，亦都係我哋都會睇緊。咁但係我諗，我相信即係而家呢段時間，大家關心我哋本身唔單止其實誒鐵路誒整體。

212
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:14,720
嘅發展係點樣樣，亦都關心我哋香港自己本身喺承建公共工程本身嗰個嘅整體嘅能力啊、人力啊嘅需求啊、人力上高嗰個供應啊，都係關心。我覺得呢啲嘢誒，最後都係會一評後。不過我同意啊，議員所講嘅，其實嗰個長遠規劃同本身呢個工程咧嗰個關係咧係。

213
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:34,730
唔係唔係唔係好直接嘅，噉我哋我哋但係喺時間處理上高咧，我哋都有先後嘅，就係噉樣樣啫。啊，主席，七月可唔可開特別？我我同啊大家分享一下啦，我同局方有保持聯絡，佢哋話需要多啲時間去整合所有呢樣嘢，因為佢下星期同我哋講咧，差唔多要交代埋將來啲嘢邊個起啊嗰類。

214
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:54,740
噉嘅嘢噉，所以我而家咧就拋咗日子畀佢咧，就暑假完係九月底嗰度。噉你哋未復我嘅嗰個咧，就係我哋去新加坡視察視察完翻嚟咧，就應該個個都大部分委員都會得即係又係在講㗎啦。噉就我拋咗呢個日期就即係誒政府嗰邊未復嘅嚇。

215
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:12,770
O.K.就同大家分享一下啫，主席或者我最最後講咧，我諗我哋都盡量會喺誒，我哋希望喺大約暑假呢段時間，譬如話誒九月中，因為我哋知道你哋又有又有即係要去外訪啦。咁所以我哋大家就緊呢個時間啫。其實，係啊，郭佩凡議員。

216
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,470
啊，唔係對唔住，胡志偉議員，胡志偉議員。

217
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,500
多謝主席。

218
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:27,490
我諗誒，高鐵有延誤，而家喺呢度嘅係即係南港島線、西港島線誒。

219
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:39,740
觀塘延線亦都有延誤嚇，咁頭先路政處處長就話咧，即係佢喺呢啲噉嘅工作裏邊咧，就有好嚴密嘅監督嘅，但係呢咁嚴密嘅監督。

220
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:57,520
但係都要去到咁後期咧，先至能夠向公眾公佈，即係嗰個工程係有疑問有滯後啦。我即係其實想再問一次咧，喺就住呢三條鐵路，其實路政處處長你係幾時先至知道有滯後？

221
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:12,280
你知道滯後之後點解你咁遲先至係即係覺得應該要督促呢個港鐵咧係向外公佈呢個滯後嘅問題呢個第一點，但係第二個咧係令到我亦都覺得就係話。

222
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,610
呢個鐵路延誤嘅問題咧，係咪反映咗路政署？

223
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:37,990
嘅監督角色咧，喺個工作上邊其實係冇角色、冇能力咧。冇角色係指勞政署你出席同港鐵嘅進度會議，永遠都只係聽嗰個彙報，等住交代，等去工地去做下樣。冇能力咧，呢個係。

224
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:54,330
我另一個擔心嚟嘅就係兩鐵合併之後咧，原本九九鐵之內有嘅鐵路營造經驗嘅工程師技術人員，一係就退休，一係就畀港鐵咧都即係盡收天下兵器，去咗去嗰邊做工程團隊嘅成員啦。

225
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:03,200
政府自己就好似面對緊一個巨人嘅小細路仔噉樣樣咧，係冇能力去面對。

226
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:13,900
我想問下政府內部嘅人員係唔係有足夠具備鐵路營造經驗、管理我哋叫project management嘅人員？

227
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:22,340
就好似以往九鐵嘅前工務司詹伯樂噉樣去發掘同埋洞悉到鐵路工程潛在嘅問題咧。

228
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,380
到最後，我想問。

229
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,840
就係。

230
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,600
其實。

231
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:38,140
話港鐵自己嗰個承造能力可能係不足，係嚟自工程總監周泰蒼先生嘅一次係向公眾嘅回應。

232
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,700
但係頭先，邱成冇副局，你就話冇嘅，唔使擔心呢個問題嘅。

233
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:56,740
究竟你又憑啲咩嘢覺得你可以係對咁熟悉工程營造？周代昌先生幾個觀點咧，係予以反駁咧？三個問題，多謝主席。

234
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:05,320
主席，或者誒先用我誒回答一下誒議員嘅問題，我先誒再請誒處長去補充。

235
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:25,650
誒有關於其實嗰個嘅監管誒鐵路嗰個工作咧，嗰個誒架構咧，其實我覺得要解釋翻清楚，變相係主要係兩種嘅誒，因為喺誒鐵路嘅營造誒嗰個嘅模式方面咧，一種係屬於港鐵本身嗰個佢自己有誒擁有權嘅一個。

236
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:39,950
個模式，另一種咧就係本身個鐵路係屬於政府，政府委託誒鐵路公司嗰種嘅誒去建造或者經營嗰種嘅誒誒服務嘅誒經營權呢種嘅第二個方式。

237
00:41:40,270 --> 00:42:00,280
由於第一種方式係屬於港鐵本身佢自己嘅擁有啦，所以佢嗰個誒，佢唔單止會全資佢咁擁有佢誒有關嘅鐵路嘅新延嘅誒路段，亦都係擁有有關嘅責任，所以嗰個嘅主要嘅責任包括融資上嘅責任、建造上嘅責任。

238
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:20,290
營運啊，又個維修咧，嗰個責任全部基本上喺港鐵嗰度嘅。咁喺呢度嚟講咧，路政署嗰個監督個角色咧，同佢喺喺啊服務經營權嗰種，由佢係由政府擁有，而只不過委託港鐵去營造同埋經營咧，呢種係唔同嘅。後者嚟講咧，個監督模式咧係。

239
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,520
嚴謹好多嘅。

240
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:41,810
咁所以兩種嘅模式，我覺得唔係直接能夠係可以比較，呢個第一點。第二點咧就誒有關於議員問到咧啊啊周大莊先生較早之前同傳媒講嘅説話咧啊，或者我可以誒誒請佢解釋翻佢嗰説話嘅意思。不過喺我哋喺規劃鐵路嘅時候咧啊，或者。

241
00:42:41,810 --> 00:43:01,820
港鐵亦都係提交佢本身個計劃嘅時候咧，佢亦都係考慮到當時本身佢哋自己本身嘅建造嘅能力，或者佢推動鐵路本身嗰個能力去評估。咁呢個係係喺當時嘅評估嚟講咧，係喺啊以過往嗰五條鐵路嚟講咧係處理得到嘅。咁當然啦，香港本身個經濟或者。

242
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:21,830
本身個建造業喺一段嘅時間裏邊，誒經過一個嘅復甦，誒而又蓬勃，裏邊可能嘅人手上高，係製造咗新嘅製找，特別係有一啲嘅，如果係滯後工程裏邊要加人手加工作去製找嘅話咧，其實係會令到咧佢喺呢啲工作上高咧喺日後嘅所謂追補。

243
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,600
補工作上，佢係製造困難，呢個亦都係事實。個配飯演員。

244
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,500
主席唔使請周生。

245
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:39,370
如果我哋噉樣樣就啲時間有，其實我留咗好多時間，不過係阿局長佢個答比較長啲嘅啫。咁事實上係噉，我哋再第二輪嘅，可冇第二輪問咧？因為如果唔係，個個都七分鐘㗎啦，而家。

246
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:59,950
或者你問題問少幾個，等佢哋答咗先，再問啦。阿郭佩凡議員，係多謝主席。誒，我諗咧，即係過去呢兩個月咧，好似冇聲。過去呢兩個月咧，即係鐵路不斷噉樣，即係誒發生呢個意外嘅事件啦。誒，每一次咧，我哋開會嘅時候咧，都問對其他鐵路有冇影響，次次答我哋咧都。

247
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,170
話冇影響，咁跟住咧就自我引爆啦！而家。

248
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:23,460
噉我仍然都係即係覺得咧，其實偉達成先生暫無狀態嘅。啊，每一次咧，你都係講遺憾啦，或者I'm sorry啦噉。咁但係我相信市民都唔會收貨。啊，我仍然都係繼續想追問，你會唔會有實質嘅表示去表達啊，即係你嘅遺憾或者錯誤咧，例如減薪減。

249
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,670
花紅收藥滿酬金咁噉啊！偉達成先生答咗先好嘛，主席。

250
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,410
你做咩？

251
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:50,330
Thank you. I do feel disappointed to the communities as we have said on the on the projects we here have here today. I would also note very very good progress that has been made in many parts of the project. The South Island Line, for example, all of the work on the

252
00:44:50,330 --> 00:45:08,790
South side is proceeding very well. We're 87% through the Nam Phong tunnel. We've had a particular difficulty in one location. Similarly, in regard to the Kun Tong line extension. However, you are correct to say that we've fallen short of public expectations.

253
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:21,150
We need to look and see how we can do better and not be in that position. And I certainly accept the responsibility for the corporation in terms of falling short of public expectations.

254
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:41,440
the the board of MTR through remuneration committee will look at this, looks at performance for myself as as well as for all of the senior management of MTR. We all support that process in in doing it. I think the most important thing for us right now is frankly to be able to give an.

255
00:45:41,440 --> 00:46:01,450
open、 transparent assessment of where we stand, to be able to talk with you and with the community about what it will take to be able to complete these these projects, to engage, continue to engage openly about doing it, and to bring them to completion. 主席，我個問題咧，其實就係希望就係各位達成作為即係。

256
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:21,460
係啊！行政總裁咧，佢主動會承擔個責任，提出一啲即係誒市民覺得可以接受嘅一啲嘅方案。誒而家佢都係將個責任咧就推畀委啊，委員會最後決定使唔使誒懲罰啦？咁噉我會覺得噉係唔負責任嘅表現。但係我諗佢今日佢都係唔會答我㗎啦。所以咧，我想問一問局方咧，主席啊，而家咧。

257
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:31,220
誒五條鐵路咧新線都工程延誤啦，其實咧造成即係幾多嘅超資金額咧？而呢個超資金額咧，將會係如何去承擔咧？

258
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:32,780
副長。

259
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:53,120
誒主席，誒我頭先頭先都解釋過啦。呢五條鐵路裏邊咧，其實咧係有三條咧係屬於港鐵本身用誒誒擁有權嘅模式去做嘅，有關嘅所有嘅誒費用誒，全部係由港鐵本身去承擔嘅。咁至於另外，

260
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:13,130
我嗰兩條係由服務經營權嘅模式去做嘅話咧，啊，我相信喺而家呢個階段咧都係仲係早嘅。誒，講講所謂嘅超支，因為我有好多嘅誒，當然有好多嘅所謂索償啦，喺工程上高嘅。但係呢啲索償有多咧，都要經過咧詳細嘅誒檢視誒去去審核，然後先能夠定到個數字嘅。張偉主席。

261
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:33,140
不過，除咗你冇講清楚咧，就政府控制誒控住hold住呢個港鐵七成股權，所以超支咧，其實我哋市民都有份分㗎，啊，郭議員。係啊，呢個正正係我想講噉。另外咧，我都想知道當初港鐵同政府所簽訂嘅協議咧，如果係誒未能如期通車嘅話啦，同埋即係誒有。

262
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,040
股損失嘅話咧，其實係誒港鐵係咪需要作出賠償？

263
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:59,530
啊！主席，我諗誒，我哋喺協議裏邊咧，港鐵其實佢要承諾咧係要盡最大個努力咧去完成嘅工程嘅。如果佢唔係做最大嘅努力去完成工程嘅話，當然我哋會係啊同律師方面去誒聽方面個意見，係點樣跟進呢方面嚇？呢個係最重要一個嘅安排。主席啊，我希望咧誒局方咧。

264
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:19,540
可以畀我哋一個書面嘅誒解釋咧，就係咁多條鐵路嘅延誤咧，其實造成幾多嘅超支金額？我哋要實際嘅金額，正如你所講，其實都係我哋納税人要去承擔嘅。噉我亦都想知道咧，即係個賠償方案究竟係點？同埋咧，我覺得政府係要評估咧，而家呢啲誒新線嘅落成日期，然後。

265
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:39,550
之後咧會帶嚟香港同埋社會經濟上面幾大嘅損失，係需要作出評估同埋向我哋市民作出一個交代嘅。咁亦都會唔會影響一啲誒新嘅鐵路嘅回本期咧？咁同埋咧誒各區嘅市民咧，其實都係要求啊，會唔會有補償嘅方案？因為有啲原本你應承通車嘅地方，而家你又你又。

266
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:55,150
又啊，即係而家通車唔到啦。例如西港島線啊，如果你而家係唔可以通車嘅話咧，噉你交通服務重組各方面咧，其實都要重新去研究嘅。咁所以每一個區咧，我都要求咧，政府係畀一個即係書面答覆啊，副局長啊。

267
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,440
得啦！你你你你自己跟進啦。

268
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:13,070
去去，有啲係可以提供到一啲具體數字，有啲可能未必係能夠一時間互動下。我哋盡量下。下一個咧，動物範兒，我想讓畀啊副主席陳振斌議員，你你講你問先啦。哦，好啊，多謝主席。

269
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,540
咁咧就誒港鐵。

270
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,500
你有幾多條鐵路起緊，就有幾多條鐵路嘅現物。

271
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:26,820
想揾翻條即係可以依時完成嘅鐵路嚟沖起下咧，都好難，實在係需要有條路。

272
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,040
公道啲講，我哋唔能夠輕視。

273
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:39,050
喺起鐵路工程嘅難度，但係咧，亦都唔應該苛責一啲好努力講工嘅工程人員。

274
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:48,990
現嘅問題當然令到市民失望，但係問題就係出喺管理同埋接受監察嗰個問題。

275
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,170
噉。

276
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:59,970
呢個唔係能力嘅問題，係態度嘅問題。根據文件咧，我睇出港鐵對路政署嘅監管咧，係採取藐視嘅態度。

277
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,040
我哋睇下港島南線，南港島線。

278
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:10,440
喺文件第廿四段，路政署咧喺二零一三年嘅三月。

279
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,570
就已經發信要求港鐵交代佢嘅進度。

280
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:26,200
咁但係港鐵咧一直都係話我哋同工程人員商量緊嚇點樣去處理，去到二零一四年二月拖足一年先去回覆。

281
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:47,150
咁之前咧就二零一四年五月回覆就話啊，我哋努力緊，噉啊目完成嘅目標咧係二零一五年，咁去到試駕一個月啦，六月就話喂，我哋滯後要拖多六個月，咁即係其實我覺得港鐵你哋嘅回覆咧係非常之輕。

282
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:55,170
疏嘅，對於路政處問你哋嘅嘢咧，你基本上唔係即係好想去答嘅。

283
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,050
好啦，我哋又睇下觀塘綫先。

284
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,850
二零一二年開始。

285
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:11,320
路政署已經發現你哋係有疑誤嘅，佢話問你哋嚇疑誤，要求你哋解釋。咁但係咧喺文件上面就顯示唔到你哋有具體嘅答覆。

286
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:28,900
咁於是乎咧，一路追啦，去到二零一四年嘅四月先去信問你哋究竟係點樣？噉你五月咧就話二零一五係可以嘅，試駕一個月咧，你喺六月就話喂二零一五唔可以啦，啊又要延期多半年。

287
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:36,730
噉我想問下港鐵，點解你對於路政署對你哋嘅查詢同埋監察？

288
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:52,370
你哋對佢哋嘅交代係愛理不理，你係唔想接受去監察啊？定係你覺得你已經高大威猛到一個唔需要監察嘅地步咧？我亦都想問下路政署，你覺唔覺得你自己係冇牙力？

289
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,710
係完全冇能力去監察呢只怪獸咧。

290
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,720
Mr. Warden.

291
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:05,220
Yes, I'll ask, I'll ask our projects director T.C. Chew to speak to this. Mr. Chew.

292
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,300
嗯。

293
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,990
Thank you for.

294
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,060
聽唔到。

295
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,420
Hello，聽到嘛？

296
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,680
啊！

297
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:22,560
I, I, we I have illustrated many a time that we we work really closely with the highway department.

298
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:33,200
Yes, they do raise question and express concern. We responded by indicating the delay recovery measure that we are putting in place.

299
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:46,090
none of us want any delay. We work, as quite rightly pointed out, we work very very hard in managing those delay. If you look at the whole detail of the various project,

300
00:52:46,400 --> 00:53:06,410
The volume of difficulty and overcome to bring us where we are today. That on Kuntong Line we are able to achieve on target the completion of all the tunnel drive except at Wangpa Station. And we say why in Wangpa Station we have difficulty. My.

301
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:20,870
誒誒，周生啊，我唔係講緊你嘅難度，我都冇否認起鐵路係有難度嘅。但係我係講緊你有冇接受路政處嘅監管？點解佢寫信畀你，你要一年之後你哋先覆佢咧？

302
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,180
會。

303
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,540
為。

304
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,790
we we respond in.

305
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:38,130
Meeting discussion on a regular basis. We respect. We engineer work together to find solution. We do respect and we do respond accordingly.

306
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:58,420
但積累嘅 delay係一 issue 後另一個，我們需要resolve and tackle，until we find finally overcome all the difficulty，that delay still remain on the table，and we explain it very clearly in our day-to-day discussion or week-to-week discussion with the

307
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:11,360
highway engineer，there is no question that we are not。我想我想了解下你哋是誒路政處一個監察嘅角色啊，定係你哋嘅乜嘢角色咧？你睇佢佢係乜嘢角色咧？喺你哋心目中？

308
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,620
得。

309
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:17,730
第二。

310
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:38,020
They are our partner in delivering infrastructure project for Hong Kong. Just like our contractor is our partner, we work together to deliver what is important to Hong Kong as quickly as possible. We have every respect for every individual because we are all professional working.

311
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:45,080
for the common goal to build infrastructure for Hong Kong. 好嘅，時間可唔可以畀誒政府回答一下？

312
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,730
幾個啊？好嘛，勞政處。

313
00:54:48,720 --> 00:55:08,730
盡盡快咯，好唔好？要再有第二輪啊。係就誒，多謝員嘅問題。咁其實誒文件咧已經交代咗㗎啦，就係即係誒。雖然咧就即係港鐵咧冇正式回覆我哋，都係誒黃建嘅交代咧，就喺呢啲會議嗰度咧，其實佢係有交代嘅。咁誒，如果佢係即係即時回覆，梗係最好啦。咁但係就。

314
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:26,560
即係喺誒工程進度嚟講咧，其實係好動態嘅。咁所以我哋喺會議嗰度咧不斷就住即係唔同嘅情況嚟即係交代即係最新嘅情況咧，都係一個即係合理嘅一個方法嚟嘅。好咁誒，即係誒，議員亦都問就係時間問題，多謝主席。我哋遲啲先啦，如果再要追問。

315
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,790
啊。

316
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,510
Mr. Warder。

317
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,560
The SIL and the KTE.

318
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,320
Will now both incur delay of six months.

319
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:37,980
但。

320
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:44,750
announcement was that it's to be updated by the end of 2014, which is the end of this year.

321
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,840
我會想知道什麼是這句話的含義。

322
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,470
是六個月 delay 一 best case 情景。

323
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,740
and that the worst is yet to come.

324
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,810
要被known by the end of this year.

325
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:10,140
In other words, it could be actually a year, year and a half delay. So please let us know. The six months delay is that the best case scenario or the worst case?

326
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:17,560
六個月 delay 反映了我們在這個項目上目前的 delay。

327
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:37,310
As the general managers have gone through, both SIL and KTE continue to have challenging aspects of those projects. While we're 87% through the Nam Phong tunnel, there's another 13% to be completed. The underpinning work has been demonstrated in the presentation that we went through.

328
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:57,600
The difficulty of excavation at KTE remains very difficult. What we'd like to do is to come back to the committee later this year. We will have more information at that time. We will have cleared some of the challenges that we have in front of us, and we can.

329
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:17,610
Give a much more certain date and precise information. So basically, you're telling us the six month delay is the best case scenario, correct? We continue to work. It can be worse, but it won't be better, right? We continue to work to try to recover time on the projects, and and and we will and the team.

330
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:37,620
is doing that and has worked hard to be able to do that, and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to recover time. But I would also say that there are very very real challenges in front of us still. You saw some of the complexity at work. So is this the best case or worst case scenario, Mr. Waldo? Six months reflects what we what we know right now.

331
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:48,370
Okay, and we will come back later this year to give you a more precise outcome. Six months delay reflect what you know right now. It does not include what you don't know.

332
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,510
And if you come into

333
00:57:51,810 --> 00:58:00,970
In the future, you add on to things that you don't know. This becomes a best case scenario, right? I just want to have a clear response from you.

334
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:21,260
I'm trying to be clear, Mr. Chairman. Clearly, I can't give you a precise estimate about what we don't know. I can only give you an estimate about what we do know right now. I am only asking for that. I do know that this is a best case scenario. I remain hopeful that we'll be able to make up time. I do not have a precise answer to give you at this.

335
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:29,420
This point in time, TC，你有冇一個更好嘅方式嚟講呢？其實，謝謝你，都係冇問題。謝謝你，謝謝你。

336
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:43,760
路政署嘅監察角色，我想問一問啊！文件十四十五啊，監察咧出現咗一次喺十四段，佢係監察咩咧？落實臨時交通措施後嘅交通情況。

337
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,610
你成份文件就係監察一樣嘢嘅啫。

338
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:53,850
就完全冇提到監察港鐵如期落實所有通車目標日期。

339
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,870
啱啱咧，周大莊總監咧就中。

340
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,430
第二啦，佢話你哋係合作伙伴。

341
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,530
partner，你哋係partners。

342
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,850
噉我想請問下啦。

343
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:19,080
副局長，你哋到底係夥伴咧，定係監察？你監察除咗交通改道嘅結果，你使唔使監察佢嘅預期通車咧？

344
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,120
局長。

345
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:41,850
主席啊，正如我頭先都講過啦。嗯，喺呢三條嘅鐵路項目裏邊咧，佢屬於係誒一啲擁有權嘅項目。誒，政府相對嚟講咧嗰個角色咧係同頭先我講係由服務經營權咧係好誒唔同嘅。咁誒，由於港鐵係屬於呢啲鐵路嘅誒擁有者，佢對

346
00:59:41,850 --> 01:00:01,860
對於整體嚟講咧，嗰個責任咧係好重大嘅。佢同政府嗰個協議就係話，佢哋會盡佢一切本身嘅誒努力啦。佢其實係去按員工去按時噉樣去完成佢嘅工作。咁誒，亦都事實上呢個按時完工作咧係符合佢哋本身公司嘅。你承唔承認你哋係夥伴咧，定係你係一？

347
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:09,940
一個監察嘅機構啊？誒，主席，我諗我諗喺係一個好決定於喺係一個乜嘢嘅一個嘅。預期通車。

348
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:14,170
喺預定通車嚟講，我係講預期通車呢一個事件。

349
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:34,460
啊！我相信我喺我哋個協議裏邊咧，佢係有責任咧，係去到要盡最大嘅能力係按時間通車。如果佢要需要改變呢一個嘅嘅時間嘅話咧，佢亦都要知會翻本身。即係喺逾期通車方面咧，你認為你一個監察角色，你就否認咗呢個所謂合作夥伴嘅一個關係。咁但係啲文件完全。

350
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,750
唔好提呢樣嘢喎。

351
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:56,390
誒主席，我相信我頭先都解釋咗畀你聽，喺誒喺呢個嘅誒擁有權個項目上高咧，其實鐵路誒公司嚟講咧，其實佢係好大嘅利益咧，係及早噉樣樣按時完成。個原因係乜嘢嘢咧？政府出錢嗰啲咧，你先至緊張；廣鐵自己出錢嗰啲，你就係一個合作伙伴。

352
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:16,400
即係，似乎我哋今日聽到好似係噉，係嘛？誒，主席，我相信我相信我解釋得清楚咧。政府嗰個角色嚟講咧，喺文件裏邊都好清楚講明。至於至於喺我哋平時嘅工作裏邊，係唔係一種夥伴？我相信我哋同議員都係一樣噉樣樣咧，係一種夥伴嘅方式咧，去完成我哋本身嘅鐵路工作嘅。

353
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,340
郭偉強議員。

354
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,980
多謝主席。

355
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,460
嗯。

356
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:36,690
港鐵五線全面滯後，已經係令到市民十分之不滿啊！唔單止失望，仲有憤怒，因為你哋嘅遲咧係影響曬全港七百萬香港嘅市民。

357
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:45,750
就住誒，剛才副局長提到誒，其實喺工程開始之前咧，係有一個誒，對於港鐵嗰個能力嘅評估。

358
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:51,780
咁但係今日事實話畀大家聽，有兩樣嘢發生咗。第一，港鐵。

359
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,860
自視過高。

360
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:57,300
第二樣嘢就係我哋政府。

361
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,750
所託非人。

362
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,810
令到問題一而再、再而三發生。

363
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:07,440
睇翻剛才啊，主席咧，你幫我問咗一啲㗎啦，就係話誒。

364
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:17,850
而家要延遲咧，就已經實實在在㗎啦！啊，講到西誒，講到西線要褪一季，講到南線要遲半年。

365
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:24,490
言辭就實實在在寫低，但係實質通車嘅日期咧，永遠都話唔到畀你聽。

366
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:32,300
我都唔知佢哋喺度做緊咩嘢。之前無論係賴地硬又好，或者係襯地林都好。

367
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:39,230
都係嘅理由。阿局長咧，頭先仲幫埋口，就話人都係理由。但係我好喺度，好想強調一樣嘢。

368
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:57,080
如果港鐵係一早講咗工程做唔切有問題，你要人，我相信勞顧會嘅兄弟係會考慮，但係你冇講啊嘛，你隱瞞啊嘛，你都冇話就話搞唔掂，咁人哋點批人畀你啊？你而家鬧人哋唔夠人。

369
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:11,370
所以，局長，剛才你提到話誒，只要港鐵已經盡咗佢嘅最大努力，你就會收貨。我唔該你啊，呢個唔好攞嚟畀你係接受港鐵遲嘅理由。

370
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:16,770
呢個我哋香港市民唔會接受，因為好多嘢係你收買咗。

371
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:32,510
我喺度咧，就想問清楚。由於呢幾條線嘅延遲咧，係對於附近嘅商户係有直接嘅影響，因為人哋打開門做生意，因為你工程遲而。

372
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:50,650
做唔到生意，或者對於佢哋有直接嘅收益影響，我想問下，以往你哋都係一個被動嘅態度，就係誒煮到埋嚟先食，去到最遲一下先至公佈啲嘢，畀人市民好反感。我就想問下，你會唔會主動去問翻呢啲商户，主動同人哋傾？

373
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:54,220
補償嘅問題，就唔好等人哋好似。

374
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:02,420
好似唔知誒收數公司咁追到上門，你先至畀反應。你而優勝於嘅話，你主動去啦。我啱啱。

375
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,740
尋日去咗黃竹坑，黃竹坑。

376
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:11,950
誒嗰個熟食街市係畀你成個港鐵嘅地盤圍實曬，人哋真係做唔到生意。

377
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:17,390
叫苦連天，你係咪會主動落去同人哋傾？我就想問呢樣嘢啫。

378
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,840
報上。

379
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:36,490
誒主席，有關於誒誒任何因為鐵路工程而蒙受損失或者損害嘅人咧，其實可以按本身誒鐵路條例，佢本身有個機制咧，係向運輸及房屋局咧係提出書面嘅申索嘅。

380
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:43,470
咁誒，佢佢根據個機制嘅話咧，係唔一定要透過司法本身嗰個嘅打官司嘅程序。

381
01:04:43,760 --> 01:05:03,770
啊，可以咁講咧，就係佢有一年嘅時間咧去做呢方面工作。咁當然啦，即係具體你個個個別嘅個案嘅情況嚟講，係誒因因人而唔同嘅，因佢哋本身個狀況而唔同嘅。咁所以我相信咧機制係存在住嘅。咁誒，至於誒係係佢哋可以點提出嚟講咧，我哋我哋。

382
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:11,530
會啊誒，根據鐵路嘅條例嚟講咧，我哋可以提供有翻呢啲消息資料咧，係畀有關嘅方面嘅啊人士嘅。

383
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:24,840
啊，主席啊，我要求咧副局長咧派人落去主動派表啊！講真，冇嚟開會冇聽會，有啲鬼知你有個申訴機制咩？你主動落去話畀人聽，係我阻咗你，我而家主動問你需唔需要？

384
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,070
我唔希望阿局長就話，仲要等人哋自己填表過嚟，佢先知。

385
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:51,980
副長，誒主席，我相信要啊，我哋唔能夠咁籠統噉樣樣講，因為事實上受鐵路本身嗰個影響嘅誒嘅人士咧，啊，我哋係唔唔希望係見到當然呢啲噉嘅誒情況係然產生啦。咁但係頭先誒行政總裁都有講嘅，關於工地。

386
01:05:51,980 --> 01:06:11,990
上交回工地上啊，譬如一啲嘅誒馬路啊，或者一啲嘅啊工地本身一啲嘅啊一啲嘅障礙呢啲嘢咧，其實佢會按翻原本嘅時間咧係交還翻工地嘅，即係話對原本一啲嘅啊馬路上或者商鋪人士嚟講咧，佢未必會造成直接嘅誒損失或者影響嘅。

387
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,960
你係遲咗半年喎。

388
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:25,230
誒呢方面，頭先誒誒主席誒頭先誒誒行政總裁有解釋到，或者我都請佢可以詳細就解釋下呢方面，交匯工地對一般嘅商户，而家用曬又再詳細解釋。

389
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,400
我哋下一輪啦嚇，好嘛？唔該曬，阿盧偉國議員。

390
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,660
啊，主席。

391
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,790
啊，對。

392
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:38,580
鐵路工程嘅工程師嚟講咧，誒呢五個項目真係一個好大嘅挑戰。

393
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:58,880
個挑挑戰咧，不但只話喺個香港彈丸之地咧，有五個重要嘅鐵路工程進行緊，而係更加進一步咧，就話呢啲工呢條工程咧係差不多同時進入工程嘅某一階段。舉個例子，前段時間咧，差唔多同步嘅鑽挖土力土木。

394
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,060
工程到而家咧，差唔多同步咧，去到機電安裝等等。

395
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:23,350
誒噉，所以喺誒之前，我哋小組嘅會議上咧，其實我都多次催問一個好關鍵嘅資源問題，就係人力。所以咧，而家咧，其實進入呢個階段咧，就緊張嘅，唔唔係話即係土力啊、土木啊嗰啲啦，鑽挖嗰啲啦，而可能咧就去到。

396
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:27,420
基建工程，譬如話咧，西港島線咧，恭喜啦！

397
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:48,400
香港大學嗰個高低落差咁大嘅一個困難嘅站頭，暫時睇咧，好似咧就話啊，唔止七型盤誒站咁咧，有咩特別嘅現象？咁呢個係係一個即係幾難得嘅。不過咧，進入咗呢個機電安工程安裝咧，你睇唔睇到咧個人力方面咧，真係有困難而。

398
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,280
真係造成咧嗰方面噉嘅污染咧，咁呢個呢個第一個問題。

399
01:07:52,560 --> 01:08:07,720
但係主席啊，當然咧，造成噉樣嘅同步進行咧，亦都唔係政府或者港鐵公司願抵想嘅，因為咧好多政治同社會因素咧，走到某啲大型工程咧，都一路咁騰咗落嚟，變成咧就變咗同步嚇，呢個係客觀嘅事實。

400
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:28,090
就對於誒西港島線通車咧，其實而家講個目標咧係今年嘅十二月，所以咧其實西營盤站如果真係遇到咁多方面嘅出入口嘅嘅營造嘅困難嘅話咧，我相信係唔係已經係話唔係話？假如未能預期啟用嘅問題啦，係咪客觀上真係唔得？如果真係，

401
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:48,100
唔得咧，其實你所講嘅後備方案，即係話咧呢個站唔啟用住，其他咧通車咧，其實呢個不失為一個一個係可取嘅後備方案，因為呢種情況其實世界上司空見慣嘅。你唔好講話營造新嘅鐵路項目啦，最近我喺法國巴黎搭地鐵，中間有啲站為非站。

402
01:08:48,100 --> 01:09:08,110
因為佢做維修啫，但係我哋都未試過，因為維修要要要刪埋一個站啊，係嘛？咁所以呢個咧，我都係客觀咧，係應該要要去檢視。即係我覺得就已經唔係話假如乜嘅問題啦。你講緊六個月，噉你仲有咩好假如咧？不如真真正正、徹徹底底要肯定咧，整個鐵路嘅營運係能夠。

403
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:22,610
喺呢個通車期咧，係能夠安全地運作到全面測試到喺噉嘅情況之下咧，其實某一個站咧延遲啲啟用咧，唔係一個好大不了嘅問題。雖然係我哋唔想，但係不失咧係一個即係係可行嘅方案。

404
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:42,910
第二個問題，誒，你講第三個問題啦嚇。頭先講係即係人力啦，呢個講係即係呢個呢個西營盤站嘅問題。第三個問題咧就係南港島線咧，其實我亦都理解咧，其中個即係好大嘅工程上嘅難度，好大嘅挑戰啦，金鐘站。咁呢個咧，其實頭先喺個誒投影片咧都好詳細。

405
01:09:42,910 --> 01:10:02,920
解釋咧，嗰個營造上咧點樣做法，要噉樣慢慢挖咗下邊咧，然後支撐支撐噉樣，使到咧金鐘站咧能夠如常安全運作，而下邊咧做成咁多嘅工程轉挖咧，呢個係好好大嘅難度嗱。噉我唔講話，即係嗰個嗰個即係假如有延遲咧，就都係一個責任問題。

406
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:12,680
啊，因為承諾咗目標就係目標嚟㗎啦，即係不能以頭先所講嘅作為一個藉口。但係咧，我都想利用少少時間咧，大家咪可以簡單解釋一下咧。

407
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:33,440
最近全部所講嘅金鐘站見到嘅某啲裂縫啊，咁咁咧，係咪真係結構上有安全問題？呢個係咧，係伸縮縫啊，或者係啲表面上嘅裂紋啊噉。因為我覺得咧，喺無論嗰個嗰個延誤個站係點啦，其實而家面對啲問題咧，如何安全地做好個工程，將來安全運作係最重要。

408
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,170
主席。

409
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:54,890
每一個議員，你啱啱問咗好幾個問題係啦。噉你最後嗰個咧，同今日以前冇乜特別關係。我諗佢哋專注問有關係㗎金鐘站呢個都係南港島線。

410
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:10,220
In regard to the spalling of concrete, it is surface spalling. It is not in any way a safety issue. I will ask TC to speak very quickly to the manpower issues in general, and then Mark to speak both to site input and the technical challenges. You only have 20 seconds, sir.

411
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,190
peace.

412
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:31,640
Well, just to give you some number, at middle of this year, at mid two thousand and fourteen, at the peak of our construction activity, we require around eighteen thousand workers, and we are currently four thousand short. So it confirmed Mr. Lowe's comment on.

413
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:42,790
on labour challenges, but we are finding different method to overcome the difficulty, including recruitment and training of deeper working. Martin, you want to explain very quickly.

414
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:52,530
Just confirm that we are targeting to open Sai Ying Pun in December. We our current progress will achieve that.

415
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,460
善眾街議員。

416
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:15,210
嗱，其實我啲睇法咧就啲同事都講過啦，不過咧我諗重申一次啦，即係誒延誤似乎真係在所難免，當然我哋唔希望見到，亦都希望即係雖然誒我諗地鐵公司想加強嗰個即係追回一啲嘅時間，但係即係正如你發信畀我哋委員會都好啦，千祈唔好犧牲呢一個誒公。

417
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,420
安全嚇，一定要確保，即係誒。

418
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:37,620
工程趕工嘅同事能夠確保嗰個工業安全，誒同埋通車嘅時候一定係要暢順嚇，唔好即係有足夠嘅測試，然之後先做。如果萬一間你趕下趕下嘅時候到到，即係有一次通通車嘅時候有一個災難。反為我個問題咧，我就想問翻呢一個啊運防局嘅邱副局長。

419
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:47,410
似乎頭先係未答得好好肯定嘅，就係而家因為咧誒巴士公司係商討緊一啲所謂班次嘅調動。

420
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:58,670
咁似乎而家係未有一個確實嘅通車時間，包括呢一個無論係東或者係無論係西港島西或者係南港島港島線嘅東段啦，嚇南港島線嘅東段都。

421
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:12,540
誒局長可唔可以同我哋保證一下咧？兩間公司其實有阿求生、黃國慶議員話通知後半年啊之內都唔好喐啊噉樣。咁其實呢個觀點我都同意嘅，即係等。

422
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,880
第一，而家唔知幾時通知。第二。

423
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:36,170
誒通車後都唔好即時啊調整嗰啲班次，誒等嗰啲通車暢順運作暢順，然之後先至通車暢順運作暢順，而嗰啲人嘅運交通誒嗰啲人嘅所謂乘搭嘅模式係即係穩定落嚟，然之後先至去講調整班次。啊，局長，你可唔可以？

424
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:45,080
我呢個問題嚇噉就誒，我有一個問題就問誒個誒地鐵嘅啫，淨好簡單。其實真有冇可能咧？就誒。

425
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:52,120
誒，而家你個西營盤站嗰度咧，係頭先出嚟都好著目，好搭，但係我都唔係搭得好清楚，誒。

426
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:01,460
係咪可唔可以喺即係安全嘅情況之下？誒，你哋好幾多出口，有幾個出口㗎嘛？可唔可能局部出口通車嘅時候運作咧？噉樣樣。

427
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,690
復過再先啦，係主席。

428
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:23,980
誒，我哋都係為咗確保咧，市民嗰個嘅即係上落班或者或者出入啦嚇，即係唔受影響咧。如果喺西港島線係誒未能夠全線通車嘅時候咧，有關於本來涉及到誒，譬如巴士啊、小巴啊呢啲噉嘅改動咧，我哋都會暫時咧就唔執行住嘅，直至到佢真。

429
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:43,990
係通車嘅時候咧，我哋即係有確定咗新嘅本身通車嘅時間咧，我哋先會執行嗰部分個嘅嘅工作。咁至於你第二個問題相關咧，就係話誒，你要求話係咪要通咗車之後，即係半年內咧都唔唔可以誒，唔可以去作任何嘅調整。噉你相信我？

430
01:14:43,990 --> 01:15:04,000
我哋嘅睇法咧就話，我哋係會分階段去做誒，我哋唔會話一開始咗通車咧，地鐵通車之後咧，馬上嘅小巴或者就馬上去進行大幅度嘅改變，因為我哋覺得都係需要咧，市民咧係逐個階段咧去適應嘅。咁所以，我哋係有一個噉樣樣嘅階段性嘅。

431
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:24,010
嘅安排。至於具體嘅時間，誒，我相信誒運輸署會同翻地區裏邊咧，係作進一步嘅磋商。多謝主席。藍咧，藍咧，唔好答藍。啊，同樣嘅，我哋個大原則係呢一個大原則嚇。當佢確定咗幾時係通車嘅時候，即係有新嘅所謂通車時間咧，我哋嗰個嘅啊誒巴士或者小巴啲公共交通。

432
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:31,500
嘅嘅時間，同嘅都會用呢個大原則去做，即係話唔係喺低温，即係簡單嚟講，低温呢啲講咧，就即刻馬上改變嘅嚇。

433
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:40,110
我諗都有分歧啊！即係我哋希望你哋即係啟動嗰個調動，即係嗰啲即係巴士啊誒，或者小巴嘅接駁咧。

434
01:15:40,390 --> 01:16:00,400
唔好，就算你話分階段都好啦。唔好即係過得兩日，或者之後就即刻做。即係多人半年，可能你覺得係即係唔接受，但係我諗三個月呢個最基本嘅，即係三個月之後你先開始逐步逐步咁分批做咧。下半年之後先開始做曬咧，咁呢個我諗啊比較比較容易即係接受，同埋減低嗰個衝擊喺度。

435
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:20,410
Last question. Last answer. Yes, you raised the question of workplace safety. I want to I want to be very very clear. It is a huge priority for us in what we're doing, and we try to ensure workplace safety for our staff, for our contractors, obviously for our customers, and for the community being there as well. You also raised the question about adequate time for testing and trial operation.

436
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:40,420
You will have seen in the slide that we put up for the West Island line a very specific point in time for that. If you want, we can speak more to that. Francis Lee is here from Operations, but we appreciate the point again that you're making about the importance of this for the for the railway. For St. James Station, I will ask Mark to speak in more detail.

437
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,140
關於的constraint in terms of the operation.

438
01:16:44,200 --> 01:17:04,210
Just quickly, then for the station Sai Kung, we need all three entrances in order to operate the station. One reason is to evacuate the passengers safely in an emergency. Also, to bring ventilation into the station, and finally to avoid congestion when the station is operating. Thank you, Chair Wai Chung.

439
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:04,640
嗯。

440
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:25,000
多謝主席。噉啊，當然咧，我諗同好多同事都即係好關注關於誒呢個工程嚴個問題。噉啊，其實即係香港誒嘅地鐵咧，就係無論喺建造啊、營運啊、效率各方面咧，水平相當高。咁其實我都聽過好多人咧，都好有讚賞嘅，無論係有。

441
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:45,010
遊客啊，或者係甚至我哋香港市民嘅使用方面，噉係唔係咧？即係好似你同事講，因為咁咧，港鐵係信心爆棚，所以咧就係做幾多多啲嚟，勿出手冇問題。佢冇評估到即係同時做咁多工程嚇所帶嚟嘅問題啊！

442
01:17:45,010 --> 01:18:05,020
同埋可唔可以即係準時交功課咧？噉樣呢個呢個係會唔會咧？咁而家我又反而睇到咧，頭先啱講有啲文件裏邊咧，或者嘅嗰個投影嘅時候咧，我又驚咧，即係誒主席嘅廣鐵而家咧就冇曬信心喎。點解咧？嗱，我睇譬如你講嗰個西港島線速誒嘅誒嘅。

443
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:20,840
港島線嘅通車安排咧，佢話確實嘅通車安排咧將於今年十月公佈噉樣。噉我驚咧就點解？因為呢個時間好近，即係佢而家預計嗰個誒完成日期。我哋做工程好多時候都係有評估成個工程嘅計劃。

444
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:41,130
凍雪講幾年噉，當然要有信心啦，主席啊，即係信心去就係因為定咗呢個計劃，而家達唔到標啊嘛。咁所以咧，大家好大意見咧。噉我相信佢定個計劃一定考慮得好周到啦，各方面嘅誒工程啊、專家啊等等。咁而家會唔會即係冇曬信心？我擔心喎，即係唔好啦。到時差唔多做好，我先講。

445
01:18:41,130 --> 01:19:01,140
講畀你聽得唔得啦？噉樣咁咁嗰個計劃要嚟做咩啊？誒主席嚇咁變咗冇計劃。咁另外咧就路政署咧做個監管角色，有嗰個專責小組嘅咁誒有會議報告噉樣。主席噉我哋又好擔心咧，即係佢係咪有獨立意見？因為冇嘅咧，應該話純粹誒港鐵因為。

446
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:16,390
港鐵咁有經驗咧，我係做個應聲蟲。佢話乜咧，我嚟跟。咁先出現咧，好似高鐵嘅時候，突然間瞓醒覺，哇！原來遲二十個月噉樣，就唔會話一啊一路睇緊，一路遲緊，咁即係畀意見咧。咁究竟佢？

447
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:36,680
即係路政署主席，我想問下有冇獨立自己對誒呢個工程方面嘅誒完成嗰個日期咧有評估咧？而家好似主席你都擔心呢個最新嗰個諗住月通車嗰日期係咪即係最基本㗎啦？即係唔會再早㗎，亦或係一個比較。

448
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:56,690
教一般我哋做工程計劃嘅時候咧，一個係合理嘅時間咧噉樣。咁而路政署對呢方面嘅時間表咧，佢嘅意見係點咧？係保守啊，抑或係進取咧？噉我都聽，想聽下路政署有冇呢方面佢自己嘅獨立意見。唔該，主席。港鐵線啦，點解又充滿信心？

449
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,270
去到冇曬信心喎！

450
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,260
anybody?

451
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:21,360
No, I think what you see on the West Island Line, we've been very clear that we believe the West Island Line will open at the end of this year. The works for train operations are complete. We are already running trains through from the existing Island Line to the West Island Line.

452
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:41,370
That testing commissioning process is is is already underway for the Kennedy Town station, as you saw in the pictures, it's very far advanced. For HKU, it's very far advanced, with still work to be done on lifts in that station. The big question and the the sole question for us is whether we will be able to complete the Tsai Ying.

453
01:20:41,370 --> 01:21:01,380
station in time for that opening. That involves both civil construction work that has to take place and the installation of lifts. And we have a plan to be able to do that. We believe we can do it, but there is no float in that plan at all. Rather than give anybody an impression that we're

454
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:21,390
Sure, we can be able to do it. We would rather evaluate the situation over the coming months, see that we're achieving the schedule that we're we're putting forth, and then be able to speak to people in October in regard to the firm opening. If we cannot do the opening of the Tsayungun station, we still expect to open the line at the.

455
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:28,280
直接畀勞政處講講好嘛，我明白嘅啦。

456
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:48,570
勞政處長，六個月嘅延誤係保守定係樂觀定係適切？多謝主席，多謝謝議員呢個問題。唔係，首先我想回答議員嘅問題咧，就係即係我哋其實就唔係淨係即係睇到誒，即係啊港鐵嗰啲報告就咁信佢啲報告。咁所以文件亦都交代㗎啦，好似喺呢個南港島線咧，我哋甚至

457
01:21:48,570 --> 01:22:08,580
至去到一二年三月開始咧，已經喺度問緊誒港鐵，即係究竟佢嗰個我哋睇到佢嗰個滯後咧，又問緊佢嗰個進度，其實係咪可以即係誒按期咁完工嘅噉。所以我哋亦都有幫佢即係其實我哋除咗即係問佢啲問題之外咧，我哋仲有做啲協調嘅功夫，譬如譬如好似南港島線咧，我哋都有同佢。

458
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:28,590
主席，可唔可以路政署一個問題就係對於嗰個而家最新嗰個工程期，佢哋個意見、獨立意見係覺得點？係最保守、定最樂觀、定係適切？誒，主席呢個呢個問題咧，其實我哋問緊就係港鐵咧畀一個詳細嘅即係時間表，我哋而佢交咗個時間表之後，我哋做咗一個評估咧，我哋可以有一個獨立嘅意見。

459
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:35,400
因為佢佢而家話咗係延遲六個月，謝偉全議員問你，你覺得呢個六個月係保守定樂觀？

460
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:56,070
啊！主席就誒，我哋都要睇到即係佢個詳細嗰個時間表咧，我哋先可以做到一個判斷嘅嗱。我哋唔可以單信佢就咁講，有六個月咧就即係做一個評估嘅。多謝主席。黃碧雲議員，我哋主席可唔可以即係稍後咧？因為其實佢都要要畀個獨立意見嘅，唔係我哋究竟聽邊個咧噉樣嚇。

461
01:22:56,070 --> 01:23:16,080
即係我哋都想知嘅，等第二輪。啊，黃碧雲演員，誒，多多謝主席。我想問下誒觀塘延線黃埔站嗰度嘅情況。咁咧就而家你話延遲六個月，咁但係咧你喺文件嗰度咧就第廿七段咧，又好似講唔埋幾時可以。

462
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:30,100
通車嘅喎，即係你好似話要等到誒，即係今年年尾先至再講到你嗰個誒，即係最新嗰個目標係幾時？咁即係話係咪有可能係六個月都唔止嘅延遲？

463
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:42,270
即係有冇一個你哋而家嘅估算，抑或係完全估算唔到，要去到年尾先可以估算到定一個新嘅啊一個通車嘅目標日期咧？呢個係第一個問題。

464
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,060
唔少人。

465
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:52,080
The work that we're doing there and the assessment process that we have to make.

466
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:12,570
誒誒，主席誒，黃議員啦。而家我哋黃埔站咧，我哋而家係有六個月嘅誒滯後啦，係。噉啊，而家我哋亦都係全力咧，係想希望誒誒推緊呢個呢個黃埔站嗰個誒建設嘅係。咁因為黃埔站咧，我哋而家就淨係掘咗大概係四成多啲啦，仲有五成嘅挖掘工作。

467
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:31,280
咧未開始，而主要嗰個誒誒風誒嗰個不誒明朗因素咧，就喺個月台隧道嗰度嘅。呢個係我哋第三季先至會開始，所以我就話要到今年年底咧，我哋會可以畀一個啊明確一啲嘅一個一個一個評估，關於黃埔站嗰個誒完工日期啊。

468
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:44,520
O K，咁但係你之前你喺完全未挖之前，你都已經有一個二零一五年要通車嘅目標。咁點解而家係因為一條隧道你就覺得唔能夠做一個估算咧？

469
01:24:46,380 --> 01:25:06,390
之前咧，我哋誒一路喺，自從我哋誒做呢個黃埔站嗰個交通改動安排啦、管線遷移嘅安排啦，同埋呢個啊呢個鋼管裝嗰個啊安裝嗰陣時咧，我哋都有唔同程度、唔同層面嘅呢個滯後嘅。噉我哋一路咧都同呢個我哋路政處咧，就一路係相。

470
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:26,400
討論呢個將呢個呢個呢個挑戰咧，係將佢盡盡量係搶翻翻嚟啲噉樣嘅嚇。噉我哋嗰個鋼管裝咧，基本基本上咧，今年第一季先至做完嘅係。噉啊，做完呢個鋼管裝之後咧，我哋喺黃埔嗰度咧，就有一個比較明確一啲嘅掌握，有關附近嘅管線。噉我哋先至作出呢個呢個。

471
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:46,410
個呢個呢個呢個呢個評估咧嚇，咁始終我哋仲有一段月台隧道未開始咧，而黃埔嗰度係一個舊船澳，亦都係誒靠近舊嘅一個海岸線咧。而我哋做嗰個鋼管裝嗰陣時咧，我哋都知道個地質變化咧係好大嘅，所以呢度係有一個唔係好明確嘅因素咧。我哋要到今年年底我。

472
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:53,790
先至可以準確掌握到。咁因為嗰度係曾經即係填海，所以有呢個所謂地質嘅變化咧。

473
01:25:54,830 --> 01:26:14,840
誒黃埔係一個舊船澳啦，噉佢哋嗰陣時係一個開山劈石做咗個船誒一個一個一個channel嗰啲噉樣啦，喺個而家現有船嗰個位度啦。跟住佢哋係回填翻嘅嚇。噉啊，因為主要上嗰度係比較靠近嗰個舊嘅海岸線啦，所以嗰個地質情況係有啲誒誒變化比較大咧。呢～

474
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:30,530
呢個係我哋做鋼管裝嗰陣時咧，我哋係冇預料到我哋一啲鋼管裝咧要去到七十米深嘅，而實際上我哋係咧鋼管裝咧係要達到七十米深，而加加令到整個呢個交通改道啦，同埋呢個工程咧係複雜咗好多嘅。

475
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:44,640
但係呢個誒，即係以前係黃埔船路呢啲資料喺未開工之前，其實都知嘅。即係嗰個未開工之前係咪冇做過嗰個地層鑽探，唔知道嗰度會有咁多地層地質嘅嗰個變化咧？

476
01:26:45,650 --> 01:27:00,350
一般嚟講咧，我哋喺工程未展開之前咧，我哋都會有一個誒誒前期嘅一個勘探啦。呢個包括呢個土質啦，同埋管線啊，同埋附近做啲乜嘢嘅誒誒特別嘅情況風險啊，誒潮水漲退啲噉樣啦，係。

477
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:20,640
就黃埔係一個誒係一個住宅係一個私人屋村啦。噉啊，我哋係嗰陣時亦都有做過啲前期嘅誒工程咧，但係因為嗰度係誒比較接近民居啊，同埋嗰個商業誒嗰個誒商場係比較繁忙啦，係噉啊，亦都係一個私人誒私家街嘅緣故啦。噉啊，嗰陣時早。

478
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:40,650
期嘅勘探咧，我哋都係有一啲限制嗰陣時嚇。噉我哋都誒收做咗一啲誒早期嘅一個勘探，亦都係收集過船澳嗰陣時嗰啲噉嘅舊有嘅照片咧，噉樣咧。咁誒，但問題當你開挖嗰陣時咧，係比我哋早期嗰陣時嘅勘探咧，係有一少少呢個出入。

479
01:27:40,650 --> 01:28:00,660
啊！我想問，最有一個問題就係話有啲咩係之前冇預計過會發生嘅，而家你哋係因為發生咗而阻延個工程。誒，包括咧，我哋聽到佢就係因為嗰度係私家街，下邊啲渠亦都係私家渠，係咪因為啲渠嘅誒老化係而亦都造成一個阻延嘅一個因素？

480
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:01,230
做咧。

481
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:22,110
誒簡單嚟講咧，誒黃埔站係有好多挑戰啦。噉啊，主要上嚟講，誒管線係其中一個啦，管線嘅老化亦都係其中一個啦，管線嘅預期嘅管線同埋我哋實際畫出嚟管線咧，亦都係一個啦。咁即情況咧，亦都係誒誒，亦都係比較我哋預期咧係複雜咗好多嘅。

482
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,390
即係包括埋嗰啲排污渠嘅問題。

483
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:44,730
排污渠係其中一個問題咧，咁亦都係有其他嘅管線嘅位置都唔係我哋早期嘅掌握嘅位置裏邊嘅。咁如果排污渠有有滲漏或者老化，係咪需要黃埔花園佢哋換咗啲渠，你哋先至可以做啲工程咧？胡安碧陽議員，而家時間誒差唔多，第一輪議員發發言。

484
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:45,620
呢句啊！

485
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:54,710
基本上喺我哋嗰個挖掘面裏邊嘅所有管線咧，我哋都係會將佢全部更新嘅，係。

486
01:28:55,030 --> 01:29:11,520
噉係由港鐵更新定係黃碧雲？又係第二輪啦，第二輪啦嚇！我哋而家第一輪議員誒發言咗啦，泛民而家咧誒第二輪咧有黃國興議員、胡志偉議員、陳斌議員誒，我本人同埋黃碧雲議員同埋鄧家彪議員。

487
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:29,430
啊！就我諗每人三分鐘啦。如果到時唔夠時間嘅，我哋就可以加時，就十五分鐘嘅嚇。就確保今日個個都可以問到第二輪三分鐘。黃國興議員，誒多謝主席。我問題好簡單嘅啫，我亦都咧係想跟進你問當局。

488
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:49,720
就係話港鐵咧講係十月咧就會有個重新嘅評估，嗰啲員工或者係誒列車開通嘅日期。噉啊，就此咧，我想問一問咧，就係政府當局，你對於誒港鐵呢一個噉樣嘅十月評估，你點睇？

489
01:29:49,720 --> 01:30:08,350
法同埋你將會扮演啲咩角色？會唔會到陣時咧，就係港鐵突然間宣佈咧，你哋亦都誒支持你誒手足無措咧？你還是咧，你經過你嘅監察，你都會咧對於港鐵嘅宣佈背書咧？

490
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,970
主席，我請，勞勞主席，請主席。多謝主席。

491
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:33,260
誒，多謝黃議員嘅問題。誒，十月呢個咧，其實指呢個西港島線嘅嚇。咁喺西港島線嗰度咧，其實就剛才啊，港鐵都解釋得好清楚㗎啦。就係即係嗰個時間咧，係比較緊迫嘅。咁咁而家我哋咧，其實已經要求咗港鐵咧，係畀每週嘅報告，係每週嘅報告。咁所以，我哋已經係加密咗個監察，我哋亦都。

492
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:53,270
咧就係去地盤嗰度睇佢實際嘅進行。噉我哋除咗呢啲監察之外咧，其實我哋都仲做咗啲協調功夫，幫助呢個港鐵嘅。例如咧，就佢有一啲喺B一B二出口嗰度咧，係有一啲需要即係按呢個建築條例咧，係需要誒呢個屋宇署嗰啲嘅批准嗰啲嘅要求咧，我哋都同屋屋宇署咧做咗啲協調啊。

493
01:30:53,270 --> 01:31:13,280
請求屋宇署咧，即係盡快，即係誒誒做咗個批核畀佢，點樣可以繼續即係去進行其餘嗰啲嘅工程嘅嗱。咁所以喺十月嗰陣時候咧，就即係如果我哋喺呢個每週監察嗰度睇到嘅情況咧，十月我哋係一個即係更好嘅即係資料咧，去評估佢即係係咪可以如期咁完工嘅啊！多謝主席。

494
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:22,280
換句説話咧，屆時港鐵嘅公佈咧係已經經過路政署嘅批准，係唔係咧？

495
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:27,310
我問佢係咪背書就噉嘅解？你可唔可以答啊？組長。

496
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:40,390
誒，當佢哋嘅嗰個講同我哋講嗰個員工時間咧，我哋一定會即係經過我哋睇咗個資料之後咧，係有一個即係誒同意或者唔同意嘅一個過程嘅。啊，多謝主席。

497
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:42,020
我跟進啦。

498
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,000
第一位係胡志偉議員。

499
01:31:44,340 --> 01:32:04,350
都係主席，我覺得今日咧問問題嘅時候，最神奇嘅一個答案咧就係阿邱副局咧，佢就講呢一個係一個全即係港鐵擁有嘅係鐵路發展嘅模式，咁所以咧就喺我哋嗰個路政署嘅監督工作上邊咧，係即係唔同呢一個係政府。

500
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:16,120
委託嗰個安排兩點，我想提一提阿歐父啫。第一就係話咧，我哋作為特區政府，唔好計呢個係港鐵，我哋係即係大股東呢個部分，其實有找數嘅。

501
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:20,270
南港島線咧係畀咗塊地，就係黃竹坑。

502
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:40,560
西港島線咧，亦都係真金白銀咧，係畀錢嘅九十九億嚇。咁仲有就係呢個觀塘延線咧，亦都畀咗呢一個何文田村嗰塊地出嚟嘅。呢一個係一個好重大嘅係政府基建嘅投資項目，你唔可以講就係話咧嗰個擁有權唔同嘅事。

503
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:48,400
時間咧角色就唔同，呢第一樣。第二個就係政府為咗呢幾條鐵路咧個監督工作咧，其實都唔簡單㗎喎。

504
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:57,700
你南港島線、西港島線咧，其實都係講緊有個七個、八個人嘅一個係即係專責隊伍，由總工程師去領隊。

505
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:09,110
如果噉樣講嘅話，你點可能講就係即係呢一個角色咧，係唔即係唔係好似我哋對呢一個高鐵嘅要求咧？講真，講高鐵要求咧。

506
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:29,630
所以我今日問個，我係之前上一站上一節問個問題都係仍然講，究竟而家政府喺內部係唔係有足夠咧？係負責工程監督嘅人員咧，去處理呢啲嘅係工程監督嘅工作。之前我講就係喺香港，因為一鐵獨大之下咧，你嘅絕大部分。

507
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:35,110
嘅係有擁有營造鐵路經驗嘅人咧，都去曬港鐵啦。

508
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:38,760
政府有冇辦法處理到咧？有冇咁人才去做咧？

509
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:44,700
頭先處啊，路政處處長即係問咗幾次，主席都問過嘅，就係。

510
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,060
今日。

511
01:33:46,500 --> 01:34:06,510
港鐵所講嘅一個可能延誤六個月嘅時間，係一個最好估計定係最壞估計？我到依家都未聽到呢個答案。其實呢個咪就反映咗就係話，你路政署嘅所謂嘅監督，其實本身都只能夠依賴就係港鐵所提供嘅資料去。

512
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:18,840
去信應佢嘅説法，然後就係企上嚟咧，就好似即係扯線公仔噉樣樣咧，去即係答我哋嘅問題。如果係噉樣樣嘅話，我自己覺得即係。

513
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:30,410
一係就係勞政署嘅工作咧，係冇盡冇能力去做；一係咧就係嗰個小組本身其實就唔值得我哋咧係噉樣樣去做。

514
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:51,350
噉我所以請阿局長你可以睇一睇就係話，你都要真係要掌握下咧，喺鐵路發展處之下咧，呢個組合咧其實一個唔簡單，動用嘅工堂咧都係非常之龐大嘅。我哋嘅廣深港高鐵咧十三個人小組咧係講緊數以百萬計一年嘅年薪，而家啲專責小組咧七八個人都係唔少嘢嘅。

515
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:52,210
多謝主席。

516
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,010
陳良斌議員。

517
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,110
係誒，主席。

518
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,870
勞政署，我想問下咧，就係。

519
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:11,430
港鐵咧就當你哋係拍檔，咁喺過去咧，你有冇試過去監管佢咧？定係事事和稀泥？誒，即係拍拍膊頭搞掂佢。

520
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:17,850
定係根本上，你哋大家係咩角色定位，根本就唔清楚。

521
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:32,250
誒係乜嘢？總言之，誒有咩事？沙煲兄弟啦，搞掂佢啦，噉樣。咁究竟你哋兩個之間嘅關係？因為頭先冇機會聽路政處去講，你哋喺成個工程上面，你哋角色係乜嘢咧？

522
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:55,000
路政署，或者局長，主席，或者我先啊，就監管角色裏邊，我我我答一答先啦。其實喺我哋嘅文件裏邊咧，對於路政署點樣樣去啊處理啊同港鐵嘅關係裏邊咧，我哋兩我哋其實有解釋到喺十四同十五段裏邊咧，一方面有協調嘅角色，另一方面亦都有監察嘅角色嘅。噉我頭先。

523
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:15,010
先係解釋咧，誒就喺呢兩種唔同嘅角色裏邊咧，其實喺喺擁有權模式同埋咧係服務經營權模式咧，係應用喺兩種模式，係個程度係有唔同嘅。但係咧都同樣具備咧協調同埋監察嘅角色嘅。我呢個想想誒講翻清楚。但係我同意阿阿胡議員佢提嗰個觀點。

524
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:35,020
即係話咧，唔可以話嗰啲係由於擁有權模式咧，政府咧完全就冇呢個監督責任。我我意思亦都唔係噉樣樣。正如第一方面，佢亦都係有用共動用到公共資源啦。而事實上，佢個工程推展嚟講咧，係對附近嘅居民嚟講咧都係有影響嘅。咁因此嚟講咧，政府或者係特別路政署咧係。

525
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:55,030
對於佢工程嘅進行順利嘅進行，或者對旁邊附近嘅居民或者係商鋪影響力方面咧，佢都有係去確保咧呢啲噉嘅資源咧都都係最細，同埋能夠儘量咧都係嚟準時去完工。呢呢個係有呢個責任喺度去做嘅。咁咁而會議員裏邊提出一點就係經過呢次嘅事件裏邊。

526
01:36:55,070 --> 01:37:15,080
其實係唔係要值得檢討翻整個嘅監督鐵路嘅？我我知道。你用我嘅時間答其他議員嘅問題。我知道，即係即係我想帶翻呢個同樣嘅問題問問題，就係話咧，其實咧會政府會喺呢方面咧會會檢討一下，日後咧推動鐵路裏邊咧嗰個監督角色係應該要點樣做得更好？呢點？

527
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:35,090
噉我就係要回答誒呢個問題。咁至於具體嗰個所謂監管嘅層次，或者或者呢樣嘢，我想誒阿阿處長可以簡單答一答。多謝主席，多謝陳議員嘅問題。就即係個角色方面咧，其實文件交代交代都好清楚㗎啦。有一個協調嘅角色，就一個監察嘅角色。咁所以即係我哋同即係港鐵嘅關係咧，一個就係被。

528
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:55,100
監察者一個就係監察者嘅角色咁誒。其實文件亦都有交代嘅，就係誒，我哋喺監察嘅角色嗰度咧，我哋喺一早啊，譬如一南港島線咧，我哋一三年三月嗰度咧，唔係因為西港島線係一三年三月，南港島線咧係一二年三月咧，我哋已經係睇到就係有即係滯後呢個問題咧，已經開始即係。

529
01:37:55,100 --> 01:38:15,110
誒問緊啊！港鐵去交代㗎啦嚇，咁但係即係我哋亦都有一個協調嘅角色。呢個協調嘅角色咧，唔係話即係同佢一個拍檔，而係我哋知道咧，就係社會係需要，即係都好想誒呢個西港島線啊，呢幾條鐵路咧盡快完成。所以我哋咧就係做咗個協調嘅角色，就係即係協助佢，即係同其他嘅部門。

530
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:34,060
聯絡令到佢誒港鐵做呢啲功夫嗰陣時咧，係方便佢進行，令到整個工程咧可以更快咁進行嘅。即係基本上就係政府就唔覺得你哋係拍檔，而係你哋係有個監察同埋協調嘅角色。但係港鐵咧個定位就唔清楚，就認為你哋係拍檔，係幫佢做嘢嘅，可以咁講係咪，主席？

531
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,360
Mr. Warder.

532
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:43,270
公道啲由零開始喎嚇，唔好繼續啊嘛。

533
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,710
Mr. Water, as recent as.

534
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:48,720
two months ago in April.

535
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,800
And one month ago in May.

536
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,710
你有冇寫過回覆政府？

537
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:55,370
That all the lines.

538
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,600
會 be。

539
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,370
completed according to schedule.

540
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,640
And on May 29.

541
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:07,880
你 visited the South Island, the Southern District Council.

542
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:13,480
and also express that you have full confidence you can meet the 2015 deadline.

543
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:15,620
一月後。

544
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:19,470
everything took a different turn.

545
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,190
everything became six months.

546
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:32,880
even at that particular level, it's a as we can hear it, a best case scenario.

547
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:35,150
我 just want to know.

548
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:42,570
Is Leshko the only institution that would be able to make MTR?

549
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:44,100
come clean.

550
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,410
and review the actual situation.

551
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,240
因為唯一差別，我可見之間。

552
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,500
未。

553
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,890
And now they said you have to come to Lachko.

554
01:39:56,170 --> 01:40:01,230
所以我們已經接過政府和高速公路署的職責。

555
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,990
Mr. Wada.

556
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,540
嗯。

557
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:24,830
No, I would not agree with that. Although we obviously take very seriously our appearance before Ledgeco, I think we have consistently said that the projects we're talking about, KTE and SIL, have had challenges. That we've been implementing delay recovery measures on.

558
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:37,970
On those projects, and and we've spoken quite a bit about that. The works at Admiralty, for example, have been discussed quite a lot in terms of the the challenges and the complexities that were there.

559
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,330
啊。

560
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:59,710
We committed following XRL to look at every one of our projects comprehensively to ensure that we were engaging with the community in an open and transparent way. Mr. Water, my question is: You've given written response to government as recent as a month ago, but today.

561
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,080
It's a different scenario altogether.

562
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:22,370
What prompted the change in attitude? I think the responses we've gave even a month ago were noting the challenges associated with the projects. However, as we looked at the schedules now, we believe that the accumulation of challenge and the time left—it has nothing to do with your appearance in Lesko today.

563
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:39,670
It has to do with the fact that we have undertaken a comprehensive review of each of the projects, and that we have said that we would commit in a very open and transparent.我想問下副局長，你有咩感受咧？一個月前嘢同今日完全唔同曬，唯一個分別就要嚟立法會啫。你有咩感受？

564
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,180
誒，主席。

565
01:41:42,460 --> 01:42:02,470
誒，據我哋本身啊，通過路政署嘅掌握嚟講咧，喺一路之前嚟講咧，誒，我哋都明白喺幾條條路裏邊咧都有佢哋本身嘅困難挑戰同埋一啲嘅滯後嘅。噉佢哋嘅誒，當然當時嘅判斷嚟講咧，都係覺得誒，佢哋喺可以喺通過追捕嘅措施嚟講咧，喺。

566
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:22,480
係做到追捕嘅，直至到誒當然，直至到係最近嚟講啦嚇，即係喺五月嘅下旬裏邊誒誒，又話畀我哋聽誒誒有變化。噉我哋當然，我哋覺得如果我哋知道呢啲變化，我哋覺得如果唔能夠按原本我哋同立法會交代嘅時間咧，我哋一定要盡早噉樣樣去同誒大家交代。

567
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:43,000
下一位係黃碧雲議員。誒，多謝主席。誒，剛才問緊咧就係黃埔站嗰度咧，誒，究竟嗰個管線嘅問題，即係尤其是排污渠嘅問題，嗰個嘅狀況係點樣樣咧？係咪需要誒，即係大規模更換先至可以即係繼續嗰個工程？誒，如果係，

568
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:52,270
係嘅話，究竟係誒港鐵會去負責更換啦，抑或係誒黃黃埔花園和黃地產佢哋要搞嘅咧？周生。

569
01:42:54,180 --> 01:43:14,190
誒喺黃埔站咧，誒嗰個誒污水渠嗰個情況咧，基本上咧，我哋只不過係打開咗我哋挖掘面嘅嗰部分嘅係，噉啊有部分係有一個啊路化嘅情況咧，噉啊而我哋喺嗰個挖掘面範圍裏邊咧，我哋係會將呢啲誒排污管係。

570
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:26,510
將佢更新嘅，即係港鐵嘅工程會包埋咗，即係更新嗰啲老化咗嘅排污渠。誒，我頭先講係誒喺我哋嗰個挖掘面範圍裏邊嗰啲咧，我哋會將佢更新嘅。

571
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,570
黃碧雲議員仲有冇問題？

572
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:47,360
誒冇啦。咁即係我哋而家希望你係可以盡快即係處理，因為今今晚黃埔花園嗰邊都會開業主大會嘅，即係所以即係問咁多呢個問題，因為想知道究竟個渠嘅問題係咪即係影響工程嘅主因嘅？

573
01:43:48,610 --> 01:44:08,620
頭先我誒主席啊，議員啦。頭先我講咧係誒呢個管線啊，同埋呢個管線老化誒，呢個係其中一個原因啦。噉啊，亦都係誒唔喺我哋之前嘅預期裏邊咧，因為喺圖裏邊睇唔到個老化情況啦。咁頭先我即係我都係再誒誒誒強調一點，就係即係我哋都。

574
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:23,390
都係盡力係推展緊呢個誒黃埔誒站。周生，我之前冇聽到你回應黃碧雲議員一個好確實嘅問題，就係一個月前你話個時間表係得嘅，而家咧就有問題。咁呢一個月內。

575
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:27,600
嗰啲嗰啲管道嗰啲噉嘅發現係呢一個月內先發生嘅咩？

576
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:36,880
唔係呢個係之前誒誒黃議員提問呢一樣嘢啦嚇，我哋咧一路以嚟咧，我哋咁一個月內發生咗咩事令到你改變呢？

577
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:47,060
其實我哋嗰個頭先我講咧，就我哋鋼管裝喺今年第一季咧，係完成之後咧，我哋係準係對黃埔整個進度咧作為一個評估嘅嚇。

578
01:44:47,750 --> 01:45:07,760
噉啊，即係而家我哋咧係呢個評估之後嘅話咧，我哋先至有即係。即係你寫信畀政府就冇做評估啊？唔係嗰時係進行緊個評估。進行緊，我就所有啲評估咧就咁叫呢一個月就完成曬，好啊。鄧家彪議員。啊，多謝主席。啊，今日咧就成個會議就即係我諗同事之間，包括我自己。

579
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:19,260
嘅就學懂一個概念啦，即係擁有權模式同埋呢個服務經營權模式咧，可能係兩個關係、兩兩套監管或者兩個監管嘅力度。

580
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:39,660
誒第一希望你即係之後補翻文件啦。究竟呢兩個模式對於嗰個監管上面，或者日後營運個監管上面有冇真係實質嘅分別？希望你哋寫清楚。我諗呢個亦都牽涉頭先我問個問題啦。未來新鐵路啊，我唔知係五個項目、六個項目定七個項目啦。究竟係邊個模式咧？

581
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:59,670
你哋會唔會係列明邊個模式咧？我相信會嘅，但係喺呢一個嘅討論裏面，我諗更加關注就係未來呢啲新鐵路項目究竟係邊個模式咧？噉啊，如果係擁有權模式咧，就我哋對於超支承擔庫房，使唔使即係即係即係要要要要追加撥款咧？可能我哋自己封咗。

582
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:03,140
封咗頂，咁但係原來咧想管管佢唔到嘅。

583
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:23,430
噉啊，服務經營權模式係冇辦法啦。如果佢即係即係嫌唔超支，就我哋付房食。咁究竟除咗呢一種噉嘅關係，仲有冇其他咧？希望你哋即係可以再補充。第二咧，問啲具體啲就係講到西線，始終都好快會投入服務啊。講到南線，我都唔知會幾耐啦，但我諗年內啦。

584
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:29,400
嚇一年多啲，同埋觀塘延線。我想問清楚喺嚟緊呢三條線嘅。

585
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,510
經營。

586
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:42,020
站務以及維修係全部聘用，尤其維修係全部由港鐵直接聘用員工去負責啊，定係外判？

587
01:46:43,440 --> 01:47:03,450
誒主席，我答第一個部分啦。誒，關於誒日後嘅新嘅鐵路嗰個模式，究竟用邊種模式經營？我哋當然，我哋會喺誒我哋日後嗰個嘅長遠鐵路誒規劃，我哋公佈嘅時候咧，誒有關嘅模式嘅規誒嗰個個個情況咧，我哋會交代嘅。誒噉，我亦都。

588
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:22,740
頭先交代過，即係話日後嗰個嘅喺政府個監管監督個角色裏邊咧，我哋都會吸收喺今次裏邊嘅經驗嚟講咧，係會誒同大家係誒會交代。我哋希望喺日後個監管方式咧方面咧，係比而家做咧係更加好嘅。咁至於阿鄧議員第二個問題，我請講。

589
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:44,430
To be clear, towards your question, MTR has the cost of construction, operation, maintenance and investment on these lines over the long term. That is fully our responsibility. In doing that, we do it consistent with our standards, and the work is is overseen in various ways through different.

590
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:57,870
The question is whether you do direct hiring to do all the work or you subcontract. We we do most of it in-house. We do use subcontractors in some locations for for specialised work.

591
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:09,990
我想問得清楚啲，即係講到西線、講到南線通車之後，日後檢查維修嘅工作係港鐵直接僱員去做，定係外判公司去做？

592
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:31,870
again, most of the work is done in house. There are specialised pieces that are done. For for example, lift maintenance is done as an outsourced activity, not done by by in house forces.即係似乎呢幾條線同其他線冇分別。誒，希望書面去補充，好嘛？Please.

593
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:38,310
嗱，我哋今日就時間啱啱好啦嚇，噉啊唔使誒加時嘅嚇。

594
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:47,170
噉就誒，如果其他委員冇其他事項咧，下次例會日期咧就係七月四號上午十時四十五分。

595
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:50,590
個議程咧，就至於大家會收到㗎啦。

596
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,600
我而家宣佈散會。
