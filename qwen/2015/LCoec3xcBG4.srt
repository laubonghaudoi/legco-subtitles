呢個有個written submission。

12
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,860
一咁啦。

13
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,310
誒團體代表喺我嘅右手邊。

14
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,380
早晨啊，各位。

15
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,580
Good morning.

16
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:07,540
嗱，我哋要稍等一陣，因為隔離嘅，佢冇少咗會議個揚聲器，似乎太大聲，所以我唔好意思，要等等大概一兩分鐘，等佢哋關掉咗嗰個廣播系統先，我哋先可以進行會議，因為太嘈實在。

17
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:59,290
嗱，今日咧就有誒七個團體或者個人咧係表達意見。我噉樣提醒下各位誒代表，就你嘅使用呢個耳機咧，零號頻道咧就係現場版本，即係話如果嗰個發言人士係用廣東或者英文或者其他語言都係即係用翻現場版本，就係零號頻道；一號頻道就係廣東話版本啦。

18
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,980
二號頻道咧就英文版本。

19
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:22,390
嗱，以及喺誒大家喺發言嘅時候咧，希望你哋係對住嗰個啊microphone啊，亦都方便我哋嘅傳譯係翻譯翻你嘅誒發言嘅語言嘅啊。發言嘅時候，請你用翻一係用中文，一係就用英文，就唔好誒太夾雜兩種語言喺同一個發言入邊。

20

咁每一個團體嘅啊發言時間係五分鐘，五分鐘嘅有。咁亦都提醒各位啊出席今次啊嘅會議嘅人士啦，佢哋向。

21
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:46,980
法案委員會陳述嘅意見咧，係唔會享有立法會權力及特權條例所訂嘅保障同埋豁免。

22
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:56,170
而你哋如果係有交過意見書嘅話咧，亦都唔會受到權力及特權條例嘅保障嘅。

23
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:16,460
嗱，噉我就而家開始請即係團體開始發言先。咁第一位咧就係建造業議會嘅葉尤嫻女士，唔該你，葉女士。Hi, thank you, Chairman. I'll speak in English. The Construction Industry Council has reviewed the bill, and we, in principle, support the implementation.

24
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,990
Implementation of the bill to grant a non-party to a contract the right to enforce terms under the contract intended for its benefit.

25
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:35,380
We consider that the construction industry will benefit from the rights conferred on third parties by the bill, which, if properly applied, will do the following.

26
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:43,070
A, provide a more straightforward route to allow interested third parties to enforce their rights.

27
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:54,770
B. 確 ensure that classes of third parties are protected, even if the particular users or beneficiaries of construction works cannot be identified.

28
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:03,450
C，避免法例的執行，of warranties and assignments involving multiple parties。

29
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:18,270
議員和成員，我們理解到有部分建築業業者對該法案可能產生額外潛在責任擔憂。

30
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:28,580
as we see it, however, as currently drafted, the applicability of the bill is very much subject to express provisions in the contract.

31
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:41,890
它does not in itself increase liability as such, but if the need arises, should provide an efficient means to address third-party rights for the construction industry.

32
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,660
主席，那係我想要講嘅。哦，多謝主席，多謝。

33
00:06:50,230 --> 00:07:01,790
The next will be Mr Lee Mason, some professor of faculty of law from the University of Hong Kong. Mr Mason, please. Thank you. The first comment I'd like to make is that there's

34
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:10,790
There's no provision ousting the applicability of Section 72 of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. This is the one that

35
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:21,150
Concerns exemptions from liability for loss or damage caused by negligence. Now, as such, the absence of of this provision of such a provision means that

36
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:32,000
Where there's an exemption clause in the main contract which excludes or limits the promisor's liability to the third party for breach of a contractual duty of care.

37
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,340
This clause will be subject to the reasonableness test in section three of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance.

38
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:51,620
In other words, section 72 of the Control of Exemption Clause Ordinance is wide enough to possibly prevent the promisor from excluding or limiting his liability to the third party.

39
00:07:51,900 --> 00:08:06,500
如果相關豁免條款fails to satisfy the reasonableness test，而喺英國，英國法例有個條文，特別不適用英國等同於《

40
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:15,170
which thereby prevents the third party from having the promisor's exemption clause avoided for being unreasonable.

41
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:33,820
Now, although the Hong Kong bill here may appear more third-party friendly, it creates uncertainty for the contracting parties, most particularly the promisor, whose liability to the third party may ultimately not be exempted.

42
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:46,890
Despite himself and the promissory having freely agreed that it should, clearly this flies in the face of the main driving force of the reform, which is to give effect to the intentions of the contracting parties.

43
00:08:47,340 --> 00:09:07,350
And it's something I think is worthy of attention, given that the UK Act expressly deals with the issue. So essentially, if Section 72 of CISO is not disapplied, then the promisor is actually open to more potential liability than he contractually bargained for.

44
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,570
與The Promised Sea。

45
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,070
第二點。

46
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,910
我我想做的是，與關節到第十一節的法案。

47
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,930
This is regarding protection of the promisor from double liability. Now, under section 11.4.

48
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:36,950
You can see that the the court or arbitral tribunal must reduce any award made to the third party to the extent to which it thinks appropriate to take account of the sum.

49
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:54,770
The first point here is just a drafting point, actually. Perhaps the words recovered by the promissory would be better at the end of that provision, just to make it clear to which sum the court or arbitral tribunal is to take account of.

50
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:05,780
第二，ly， to the extent that section 11 is designed to protect the promisor from double liability.

51
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:13,720
它做噉樣只係為咗預防同一筆損失嘅雙重抵扣。然而，可能有啲情況。

52
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,690
very occasionally, where the promisee suffers personal loss as a result of the promisor's breach.

53
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,120
and this loss is separate to the third party's loss.

54
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:47,410
This seems to have been overlooked by the law reform commission. And at paragraph 4.146 in their report, they essentially they are agreeing with the English law commission that a promissory would be left with no corresponding outstanding loss once the.

55
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,270
Third party had recovered damages.

56
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,450
This is not quite right.

57
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,370
如果第三 party 聲稱和 recover 傷害前，

58
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:07,240
on which the bill is actually silent, then the promissory should still be able to recover for any personal loss of his own.

59
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,930
which is over and above any damages previously recovered by the third party.

60
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:23,670
Furthermore, the provision should make clear that even if the promissory claims damages for his personal loss first.

61
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:44,230
然後，任何後續的獎勵給第三方，應該不考慮到代表那筆損失的金額。這似乎很容易達成，透過在第十一章四節中加入對第十一章三b節中列出的類型的金額的參考。

62
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,770
係。

63
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:55,610
And finally on this particular point, although Section 114 intends to prescribe that.

64
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:16,160
任何第三 parties的損失，應該被抵銷，對應任何先前的賠償，對於同一個損失由承諾人，沒有明確的規定處理承諾人對第三 parties的賠償責任。

65
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:36,290
Although this could reasonably be left to the common law as as part of a restitutionary claim, an express provision that the promisor will account to the third party for such damages would make the position clearer and arguably reduce the likelihood of litigation. I'm weary of time. I have.

66
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,850
幾多個其他點，但係我可以 leave it there， if you.

67
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,840
Okay. If you got other, do you have any written submission? I I do have written submission. That's good. Okay.

68
00:12:46,850 --> 00:13:06,860
第二位跟住要發言嘅就係香港保險顧問聯會嘅陳志剛先生，陳生唔該你。係主席，大家好嚇。噉就誒，我哋會咧就誒並冇一個必誒即係書面嘅submission嘅，咁誒亦都個時間比較即係緊迫啲，因為其實我哋收通知都係即係數個工作日前啦。咁誒當然啦，即係。

69
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:26,870
保險嘅顧問咧，insurance broker，佢誒雖然有啲情況咧，就係都會參與起草嗰個保單內容啦。特別係一啲誒大型商業風險啦。咁而但係大部分嘅情況咧，保單咧都係由於日本公司去去去去drop嘅。咁所以我哋喺呢方面其實咧係演個相對次要啲嘅角色。

70
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:46,880
噉我哋都係誒同香港保險業聯會，即係保險公司嗰邊嗰個聯會咧，亦都有緊密溝通嘅。噉我哋瞭解，其實佢哋亦都喺誒誒啱啱我見到即係台台面上，佢哋都係有一份文件啦，就五月七號啦嚇。咁亦都誒，其實我哋知道咧，佢一日聽住一個係誒之前一三年。

71
00:13:46,880 --> 00:14:06,890
一月嘅一啲信係畀D.O.J嘅，噉就誒去誒要求澄清一啲問題。噉我哋當時都我哋都有一啲溝通嘅。噉我哋亦都誒睇翻咧，就係喺某啲誒事情上面而影響到個保單咧，依啲嘅嗰個應嗰條嗰個法律嘅應用咧，我哋係唔係好清楚嘅？咁誒。

72
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:23,950
而我哋啱啱睇到，亦都保險業聯會亦都係有一啲誒意見咧，係亦都係誒，亦都係睇翻誒嘅英國一啲法律嘅情況啊。噉我哋係基本上亦都係誒同意佢哋一啲睇法嘅嚇。咁呢方面就誒，噉我諗啊。

73
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:44,240
誒，當然，如果喺保保險公司能誒，就可以喺嗰個保單內容裏邊，如果係加入有關條款咧，就譬如話誒誒講翻嗰個呢個呢個有關嘅應用咧，咁呢個其實就會係清晰化咗件事嘅嚇。咁誒，將我主要嘅發言係咁多。好，唔該你啊，陳生。

74
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:53,520
咁下一位，下一位咧係啊特許仲裁學會東亞分會嘅楊凡博士，Doctor Yang，唔該。Okay, thank you, Chairman.

75
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:09,870
The Charter Institute of Arbitrators East Asia Branch supports the bill, and we welcome, in particular, section 12 of the bill, which clarifies the third-party rights in arbitration agreements. And that's all. Thank you.

76
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,990
That's very quick. Thank you very much.

77
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:32,280
啊！第跟住要發言嘅係香港人壽保險從業員協會嘅謝國寶先生，謝生唔該您。好，啊早晨咁多位。噉我哋喺誒二零一二年咧，就就呢個嘅標，我哋亦都有一個submission上咗嘅。噉我哋咧就其實係保險從業員協會。

78
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:52,290
係前線嘅工作人員，噉啊，其實啊，大家都睇到枱面啊，康景一快咧對，因為通常保險合約咧就保險公司會去預制定嘅，咁thus far我哋亦都同係康景一快咧都有係就住呢件事有一個嘅緊密嘅溝通，但係就住嗰個嘅諮詢裏邊咧，我哋。

79
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,260
係對裏邊嘅提，其中一個條款係。

80
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,190
cross six，我哋有一個好大嘅困局。

81
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:19,530
第一咧就係呢個cross-sex，佢係畀咗咧誒，就係旨在係保障嗰個第三者，而咧就限制咗個合約嘅雙方咧。如果佢哋同意去修改或者係更改個合約嘅內容咧，而從而係減少咗第三者嘅利益咧，佢哋係需要通知。

82
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:29,360
治我哋三者嘅，同埋要保障我哋三者。咁六點三咧，就係賦予咗咧嗰個合約嘅雙方咧，可以定定一啲條款。

83
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,110
去更改、修改一個合約。

84
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:48,730
唔使第三者嘅認同，但係六點四咧，亦都加咗一樣嘢落去咧，就係佢哋需要take一個有效嘅步驟，令到咧嗰個受益人，即係第三者咧，係要知道呢件事。

85
00:16:49,020 --> 00:17:09,030
噉我哋咧就通常咧係誒同客户嘅接觸咧就係保險公司同埋我哋前線人員。噉我哋發覺咧呢一點咧，我哋係喺實務上咧係有個困難嘅，尤其是咧如果咧誒好多時啲客户咧買咗一張嘅保單，經過一場好長嘅時間咧。

86
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,730
佢亦都會牽涉到一張單攞錢。

87
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:20,230
借錢其實呢啲或者係減低個保額。如果引用呢個條款咧，其實係需要通知一個受益人嘅。

88
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:40,520
噉我哋發覺咧，就係呢個實務上係有困難。咁第二樣嘢咧，就係點樣去接觸個受益人，有陣時未必會接觸得到嘅。嚇，或者有啲客户咧，甚至到係唔想個agent咧去接觸嗰個受益人。再者，如果個受益人係一個小朋友，咁好多父母都將將。

89
00:17:40,520 --> 00:18:00,530
保單咧，為想保證小朋友咧係畀咗個小朋友嘅。咁喺呢啲情況之下，咁邊個可以代表個小朋友去畀呢個consent或者去接收呢個信息咧？咁呢個咧實際上誒令到我哋喺前線人員去做嗰時咧，其實咧可能都需要多啲嘅街拉同埋指引，或者。

90
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:09,110
喺個制定呢個例嗰時，可以畀清晰嘅誒條文畀我哋去跟從，好嘛？唔該曬，我好。

91
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:19,170
唔該曬你啊！噉啊，跟住要發言嘅就係英國特許建造學會啊，阿藍偉才先生，藍生唔該你，thank you。誒主席。

92
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:39,460
主席你好，誒其實誒我哋建建築業咧，誒最主要咧誒執行起上嚟咧，我哋都會通常都會有個大最主要嘅合約，即係英文叫main contract，即係大合約啊。咁其實合約裏邊咧都好多時都cover曬呢啲third party嗰個誒嗰個誒條文啊。

93
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:48,400
情嘅，咁一般嚟講咧，呢條文咧，我哋誒大合約咧就會好睇誒政府部門啊誒。

94
00:18:48,750 --> 00:19:08,760
誒個客啊，同埋或者有啲誒發展商佢哋所所定出嚟嘅要求嘅，咁從而因為因應呢啲要求咧，咁誒大大誒大盤咧就會base on呢個要求咧，就會去誒跟個合約去去同誒業所公司賣嘅，咁其實。

95
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:28,770
線上咧，建築業裏邊，誒成成建商又好，或者所有從業員都都好，被動於呢一個誒大合約㗎。咁其實頭先好似C.I.C.提，如果佢哋鼓吹佢哋想需要點樣保障嘅話，其實誒，我諗我哋業界即係建築業業界咧，啲人咧就好樂意去配合嘅。咁正如頭先。

96
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,750
啊！

97
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:50,050
啊，謝生咧，佢都提到，其實就最緊要一樣嘢就係，誒，你落啲條文落去，如果係執行得到同埋容易明白嘅，呢樣嘢反而我哋覺得係誒好緊要咯。因為如果我哋作為誒同誒驗數師去買咗一份保險，而裏邊嘅保險裏邊的條，

98
00:19:50,050 --> 00:20:10,060
係點樣能夠保障到第三者？可能自己有陣時誒，業界有啲人都唔係咁清晰嘅話咧，變咗買咗有樣嘢，可能係保障到第三者，而令到第三者誒，因為唔明而係攞唔到保障。咁反而我係覺得誒呢樣嘢緊要啲咯，即係買誒。

99
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:30,070
即係要求一個清清晰啲去去表達，然後令到誒誒第三者亦都要即係推廣下第三者知道佢自己嘅權益，咁令到中間我哋誒承建商或者業界啲人咧係知道點樣去執行或者點樣推廣配合咧，我諗呢樣嘢最緊要咯。啊，我講咁多。

100
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,270
咁多唔該，主席。好，唔該曬你。

101
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:39,650
The next one to speak will be with Mr Peter Clayton of the law firm Pinsen Masons. Mr Clayton, please.

102
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Good morning, Chairman.

103
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:50,920
我係喺旁邊香港建築業協會。

104
00:20:51,240 --> 00:21:03,740
And the submissions from the Hong Kong Construction Association are that the introduction of this legislation is not considered right or necessary for the construction industry.

105
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:17,010
或 indeed for the end users of of the the buildings and projects which the industry delivers, and therefore an exclusion is sought from the legislation.

106
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,720
The reasoning for that.

107
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,590
The very strong and cogent reasons for that are that one of the distinguishing features.

108
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:45,880
of the construction industry is its reliance on very large, complex contractual chains. This has already been talked about by the previous speaker, where typically starting with a developer or a government department or end procurer will then have a series of contracts through main contractors, subcontractors,

109
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:54,920
供應商，There will be usually agreements with designers and other consultants involved in the design, construction and supervision of the construction works.

110
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:09,720
And of course, in a sense, all the participants in the contractual chain are working to benefit the end users and the various stakeholders and so on who will use the completed projects.

111
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:26,280
所以，有潛在地，很多問題，關於什麼工作和什麼條款和合約會惠及第三方，和業界已經有一個試過和驗證的方法。

112
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:46,570
for ensuring that third parties have relevant rights where the parties intend that to happen through the use of collateral warranties and transferable guarantees and so on, and what that requires is for parties to set up specific contractual structures, but ones which use fairly standardised and as I say tried and tested methods.

113
00:22:46,570 --> 00:23:00,830
of providing collateral warranties, the drafting and execution of those documents is not a particular burden for the industry, and in effect, what this legislation is proposing.

114
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,000
是，那 parties 可以 still do that by identifying in their contracts.

115
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:27,630
the the third parties that are to benefit and the nature of the rights that they are to enjoy and so on and so forth that all requires scheduling out and detailing carefully in contracts and one effect of this legislation will be to require the industry to go through its various contracts and consider its position on each.

116
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:47,640
project and consider what rights need to be addressed in their contracts and so on and so forth. So in a sense, it's the same exercise that is done already in relation to collateral warranties, except that there is going to be a lot more work, more work for the legal industry. Frankly, it's not something that's necessarily going to benefit the construction

117
00:23:47,640 --> 00:24:07,650
或the customers and end users of the construction industry's product, and of course, what will undoubtedly happen is that the the larger, more sophisticated parties in in the field of construction and development and so on, will stick with the current approach they have with collateral warranties. That's essentially what.

118
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:20,670
happened in the United Kingdom, for example, and they have the option in any event to exclude the effect of this legislation by by express words. So, if

119
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:41,180
If the legislation is implemented, it is covering construction. I suggest that that many parties will carry on as before, using the collateral warranties and excluding the effect of the act. And where the act is really going to have an effect, will be on the smaller, less sophisticated parties involved in construction. But then.

120
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:48,390
Is that going to provide any particular advantage to purchasers, tenants, and so on?

121
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,440
not not really where where they are.

122
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,810
Going to have to go if if they're to seek to rely on the act.

123
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:18,100
In cases where parties haven't expressly dealt with whose benefit is, sections four one B and two, which is going to mean that they've got to look at contracts to see which contracts purport to confer a benefit on them, and to try and establish that they're identified as a member of a class.

124
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:32,770
或 answering a particular description, so that is potentially a rather legally uncertain situation, and the effects of that, well as I say, uncertainty, also parties are going to be looking around trying to understand.

125
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:53,060
Who has been active in the contractual chain? Who might they have a claim against? They're going to have to try and find out what their contract terms are, whether those terms express benefits and so on. And what that could lead to is multiple proceedings against various parties in the contractual chain, rather than the current position where a single claim would be brought against.

126
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:13,070
The procurer or the developer, and the developer in turn would seek recourse to other parties in the contractual chain. So again, we don't see that that particularly benefits, if you like, the consumer and the end users. It's going to generate uncertainty. It's going to generate additional costs, and frankly, frankly more work for lawyers, which is I suggest not the objective of this legislation.

127
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:33,080
And I think it's far better if there are concerns about delivery of the industry and the Hong Kong construction industry fully accepts that contractors should deliver to contractual standards and be responsible for work that they are responsible for and correcting defects and so on. But far better to focus on increasing the rights of

128
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:53,090
Consumers and end users in terms of their rights against developers and procurers, and limiting their ability to exclude liability and avoid responsibility for delivering developments and units to required standards. So, in summary, the principle of the legislation. There's no comment on that, but.

129
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,330
It suggested that there should be an exclusion for the construction industry.

130
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:19,690
好啦，噉就聽完七位誒團體或者個人嘅嘅意見，其實有好多唔同嘅意見，包括有啲drafting point、啲construction industry嘅exception，或者甚至係其他嘅誒我哋現有嘅誒ordinance，譬如control exception clause ordinance等等唔同嘅意見。噉我哋而家以下畀翻時間政府回。

131
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:35,610
形式跟住咧，我哋嘅委員當然會對求先誒各位團體發比較意見，亦都有意見或或即都有問題想問佢哋嘅。噉我哋一間先做呢個部分，而家我哋請政府啊作一個整體嘅回應先。唔該，阿黃生，唔該你。

132
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:56,320
啊！多謝主席。關於剛才啊幾位代表就啊今次個條例草案嘅意見誒，我哋其實喺較早前做諮詢嘅時候咧，好大程度上已經係即係啊聆聽過，亦都係參考過有關嘅內容。我哋嘅目標都希望做一個好嘅條例，令到香港關於處理第三者權益嗰度有一個好嘅架。

133
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:16,330
下購喺度，今次我哋特別歡迎即係剛才啊CIC Construction Industry Council同埋楊帆教授提到關於誒今次個建議入邊嗰個內容，表示歡迎。尤其是CIC表達到就係話呢個內容其實可以幫到去處理第三者權益，尤其是喺建築業界上高。咁至於誒楊帆博士。

134
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:36,340
都講到就係關於嗰個啊仲裁嘅條款，其實我哋都係誒相信，亦都希望可以幫助到喺處理第三者權益上高有一個清晰嘅條文去處理。至於誒其他個別即係代表表達嘅意見方面咧，其實我可以作一個初步回應，但係我哋都建議可能有一個比較詳細啲嘅書面回應，可能較為恰當。

135
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:56,350
可以幫最好啦，唔該，議員。誒，至於誒初步影像高，我可以就誒剛才其實提過幾方面嘅，包括Professor Lee Masons提到關於係誒英國嗰方面，即係第七條第二款，佢哋即係一九九九年嗰個誒涉及到第三者嘅條例上高嘅條文上高。

136
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:04,900
誒，我哋係冇用到英國嗰個方面嘅考慮噉樣。咁喺呢個條文上高，我哋冇採納到咧。係其實我哋都係落實誒。

137
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:25,960
法律改革委員會喺報告書入邊嘅第四點一二七段入邊，即係提到嘅建議，其實佢哋都考慮過究竟係咪應該容許第三者依賴有關嘅豁免條例去嗯處理呢啲豁免條款咧噉樣。咁喺英國方面咧，係誒。

138
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:45,970
冇應用到嗰個第七十一章《Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance》入邊嗰個條文嘅。英國當然係另外一個條款，但係內容基本上係第七條第二款關於《Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance》第七十一章。而我哋睇到法律改革委員會係考慮過之後，原本我哋初步建議係覺得應該係誒排除於呢個第七十一章嘅。

139
00:29:45,970 --> 00:30:05,980
適用範圍之內，但係經過收到各方面嘅意見之後，佢亦都係仔細考慮過，覺得係應該係唔排除嘅，即係話容許第三者仍然可第三方用，仍然可以倚賴呢個條文去保障翻啊第三方喺處理關於即係呢個豁免條款上高嘅情況。咁呢點我哋係表達認同，所以根據基啊成。

140
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:19,310
個即係建議，即係啊！法律改革委員會嘅第四點一二七，同埋之前有幾段嘅討論之後咧，我哋都係誒覺得應該係同英國嗰個做法咧係有分別，仍然係用翻即係法律改革委員會嘅意見噉樣。

141
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:39,600
咁誒，至於頭先亦都提到有一啲關於係嗯雙重嘅法律責任等等嘅問題，我哋留意到其實剛才提嗰啲問題咧誒，好大程度上法律改革委員會其實亦都已經就呢方面係討論過。舉例嚟講，頭先係有提到一點咧，就係話關於需唔需要特別處理到如果第三者。

142
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,570
佢係喺嗯。

143
00:30:42,240 --> 00:31:02,250
向嗰個承諾人係直接提出呢個訴訟，攞到呢個賠償，先於即係嗰個啊受諾人先，咁使唔使有一個特定嘅條款嚟處理咧？根據誒報告書嘅四點一四六入邊嘅內容，覺得其實考慮翻英國法律改革委員會嘅意見之後咧，其實覺得係唔需要。

144
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:22,260
要明文去處理呢個問題，咁所以我哋都係睇到其實四點一六咧，誒四點一四六呢段咧，其實亦都處理咗相關嘅問題。誒至於頭先亦都提到就係話會唔會係誒需要有個明文嘅條款去處理？如果嗰個受落人攞到有關嘅賠償或者相關嘅補償之後，需唔需要？

145
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:42,270
喺誒法律嘅條文入邊，有個具體嘅條文講明係有責任將呢啲誒攞到嘅賠償係轉交畀或者向第三者係轉交或者負責翻咧噉樣。就呢點，其實法律改革委員會嘅四點一四三入邊，亦都就相關嘅內容作出咗討論。佢哋嘅建議就係話係唔需要一個明文嘅條文喺度，因為

146
00:31:42,270 --> 00:32:01,320
亦都係參考翻英國嘅做法，就話誒讓法庭喺呢方面咧能夠喺法律上咧有一個進一步嘅發展，所以係唔需要個明文嘅誒條文喺度。噉我哋亦都係參考咗法律改革委員會嘅意見，亦都認同佢嘅做法，所以我哋都冇做呢個相關嘅安排喺度，亦都係同英國嘅條文喺呢方面咧係誒相約嘅。

147
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:21,800
咁至於誒另外幾位誒今日出席嘅代表誒，我睇到主要有誒兩類咧。一方面係誒保險業方面啦，另外一方面係關於建築業方面嘅誒。就保險業方面，其實我哋喺誒二零一二年誒第四季嘅時候作出嘅諮詢咧，其實都收到佢哋。

148
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:41,810
寶貴嘅意見，包括保險顧問聯會同埋香港保險誒人壽保險從業員協會，佢哋分別喺十二月份誒十二月三十一號同埋十二月嘅二十一號，其實都有信件交畀我哋。我哋都仔細個考慮佢哋嘅意見。誒，所以而家作出嗰個法律草案嘅建議，其實係誒參考咗意見作出個落。

149
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:49,260
不過，我哋留意到其實一個比較重要嘅關注就係，究竟應唔應該將誒成個誒？

150
00:32:49,540 --> 00:33:09,550
第三者權利條例草案嗰個適用性係誒排除於即係保險嘅合約上高咧噉樣。咁呢點其實因為去到一個比較核心嘅問題，所以我哋誒睇到其實關於呢個問題喺誒法律改革委員會就呢方面咧，其實較早前喺佢嘅報告書咧，亦都做咗一個比較詳細嘅討論嘅。

151
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:29,560
其實喺四點一八三至到第四點一八四入邊咧，都出錄咗即係相關嘅關注嘅問題。其實誒，簡總括而言咧，其實我哋睇到法律改改革委員會覺得誒平衡個各方面嘅考慮之後，其實應該係四點一六誒一八三到一八四嗰度咧，佢哋睇到就係話其實。

152
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:40,050
係唔應該將睇唔到一個即係充分嘅理由咧，係排除保險合約於呢個即係今次嗰個法律草案嘅內容之內。嗯。

153
00:33:40,330 --> 00:34:00,340
尤其是因為誒成個條例草案其實容許雙方合約雙方係用一個所謂contract out，即係話佢哋可以表明就係話有關嘅合約係唔適用呢個即係第三者權利嘅條例草案。咁所以作為一個最後嘅機制，你其實有個渠道喺度誒。不過至於頭先提到一個比較技術性嘅問，

154
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:09,390
問題就係話，如果誒，譬如話有啲情況，根據嗰個相關嘅保險合約嘅內容，係可能嗰個誒。

155
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:16,090
誒受保人佢可能喺根據合約嘅內容去誒，可能係誒。

156
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:36,390
喺個合約當中攞一啲其中嘅錢，或者借其中一個錢，會唔會因為咁要通知翻受益人咧？其實呢點我哋覺得誒，如果佢係跟翻嗰個合約內容去即係實施嘅話，其實我哋都好懷疑。我睇落去其實應該係唔屬於呢個情況，因為其實我哋成個架構就話，如果修改嗰個合約。

157
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:56,400
或者係變更個合約，根據草案嘅第六條咧，噉就一啲程序喺度要處理。但係如果我哋係跟翻足個合約原本嘅條款去做呢件事情嘅時候咧，其實應該係唔需要再作一個額外變化。所以我諗呢點係第六條本身嗰個特點，就係話係更改或者修改合約內容嘅時候咧，先出現頭先講話有個通知嘅情況，況且。

158
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:16,410
第六條入邊其實一間稍後，如果我哋逐條條文睇嘅時候咧，亦都會留意到，誒入邊都有啲機制嘅，譬如包括話，誒喺個合約嘅條款入邊，其實合約雙方可以具體地去處理呢方面嘅問題。咁稍後可以再進一步向即係議員介紹。至於誒建築業界方面，亦都我哋瞭解就係之前亦都。

159
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:36,420
提過關於話，即係會唔會將呢個條例草案係剔除於即係建築合約方面咧？噉就呢方面，我哋留意到法律改革委員會喺報告書嘅四點一七九一路至到四點一八二入邊，都係有一個相當詳細嘅討論。而實際上，佢哋喺嗯呢個誒佢哋個十committee係一個誒委員會嘅。

160
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,110
階段咧，其實佢哋亦都係誒同呢個誒。

161
00:35:41,390 --> 00:36:01,400
Construction Association呢個誒直接係有一個即係見面嘅機會，去就呢方面咧係更加詳細嘅討論。其實我哋留意到法律改革委員會亦都係經過即係深思熟慮考慮過各方面嘅因素之後，亦都參考咗誒外地嘅做法之後，亦都係覺得唔應該係將建築誒合約係排除於外。

162
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:21,410
外誒，其中最後個底線當然亦都係雙方可以係反映翻佢哋意願嘅時候，將建築合約係即係雙方合建築合約，佢覺得呢個第三者嘅條啊條例係唔適用嘅話，可以明文表達出嚟。但係正如剛才Construction啊C.I.C.表達嘅時候咧，其實佢哋都睇到。

163
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:41,420
其實呢個係有佢個益處，亦都有方便嘅地方。就好似喺上一次，主席，我喺誒法案委員會嘅時候，亦都表達咗。其實我哋成個呢個架構其實係去體現雙方嗰個誒合約嘅意願，同埋去便利雙方，以致可以更好嘅係去處理一啲即係誒唔合理或者唔公道嘅情況。

164
00:36:41,420 --> 00:37:01,430
咁所以誒總括嚟講，我哋睇翻誒誒一方面，我哋喺誒稍後再有一個比較詳細少少回應。但係就頭先即係大嘅方向，包括誒究竟應唔應該排除誒某啲合約、某一類型嘅合約咧？我哋睇到法律改革委員會亦都係覺得係唔應該，我哋都係表達認同。至於誒。

165
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:21,440
再具體嘅，我可以即係如果需要，我可以再補充。多謝主持。好，阿阿黃生，我諗最即係我諗你之後咧，你頭先應承咗我哋係畀翻一個書面嘅回應，就團體提出每一個嘅問題嚇。咁唔該曬你先。咁而家嘅時間咧，我就畀各位誒法案委員會嘅同事咧，係作出一啲意見或者係誒咁而家。

166
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:29,390
咧就我手頭上嘅就有阿郭榮亨議員同埋陳建波議員，仲有冇其他議員想發言嘅？噉我就。

167
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,240
唔係太設時間限制，你哋暢所欲言啦！阿阿郭榮亨先啦，唔該你。

168
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:54,820
啊！都係主席，主席，我首先想講講就係嗰個誒消費者委員會嗰個誒書面誒意見咧，就係C B四六二九slash一三。阿郭榮亨，不如你可唔可以？其實你而家講嘅同而家團體講嘅誒意見，即係呢一份報告書，你想想畀大家係咪同佢哋有關嘅直接呢樣嘢？

169
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:12,860
其實有嘅，因為佢哋之前有有有有啲人有提過，但係啊，我想局方回應一下，具體回應一下嗰個消費者委員會對於誒誒佢哋嗰個意見書第八段嗰個意見咧，就係話佢覺得誒保障消費者嘅權益係需要喺嗰個誒。

170
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:22,640
啊！法案嗰度有具體嘅條文去展述，去去保護佢哋權益。呢個第一，我第一個問題。第二咧就係我留意到頭先啊，Professor Mason咧。

171
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:42,930
佢誒話仲有其他意見，佢唔夠時間講噉，我想畀埋佢講埋佢嗰幾點嘅嘅意見，跟住我哋先誒再跟進。多謝主席。好啊，啊各位鄉啊啊，Mr.Mason，you can possibly finish whatever you haven't done so, please. Well, thank you. I'll just be very very brief then. Um, my

172
00:38:42,930 --> 00:39:02,940
我的點都係其實係關我，我有啲啱啱嘅保留，係關緊第12條嘅仲裁協議，但係我啱啱嘅保留都係有少少減退咗，喺呢一年度，特別係喺最近嘅英國高等法院嘅判決，Fortress Value同Blue Sky。

173
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:18,260
But just in in in in relation to that slightly, there's no provision I note dealing with mediation agreements. So we have one with arbitration agreements, but there's no provision dealing with a third party right which is enforceable.

174
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:38,550
Only by recourse to mediation before maybe going to arbitration, that seems to be missing. And one very final point is in relation to section thirteen. That's the exclusive jurisdiction clause. Do exclusive jurisdiction clauses confer a burden on third?

175
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,210
啲。

176
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:51,330
委員會是 well aware that no other common law jurisdiction has a legislative provision expressly dealing with exclusive jurisdiction clauses.

177
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,400
The main problem.

178
00:39:53,730 --> 00:40:06,030
或至少不確定性，它似乎似乎在於排除條款的語境中，當原告提起訴訟，對第三方。

179
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:23,880
如果第三 party 想要依賴一個排除條款，which was conferred on him for his benefit， does it mean that a third party is subject to the burden of being forced to defend himself in the jurisdiction agreed in in the main contract?

180
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:37,270
Now there are various ways of arguing yes or no for that, but the actual position is actually is unclear because section 13 is more or less floating in uncharted waters.

181
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,400
嗯。

182
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:44,640
Those are just a few of my my thoughts, and I can provide a bit more detail in the in the written submissions.

183
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,570
Thank you.

184
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:55,180
黃專員，你而家有冇一啲回應先？唔該你嚇。主席，我可以初步回應啊，關於頭先啊提到誒，個議員提到關於誒。

185
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:15,710
誒消費者委員會佢哋誒希望就誒成個保障能夠更加寬鬆嘅問題係誒提出咗意見。其實我瞭解到呢個提議喺誒成個法律改革委員會嘅報告書入邊咧，其實都有一啲嘅討論，尤其是喺誒四點四零之後幾段咧，其實就呢個問題都曾經作過考慮。

186
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:35,760
佢哋都理解到啊消費者委員會嘅關注，但係認為今次嗰個，因為佢哋嘅關留意到消費者委員會個建議係令到甚至係並非雙方嘅意願嘅情況咧，其實都可以讓第三者咧去執行有關嘅利益嘅條款。其實呢個就誒，正如法法律改革委員會嘅報。

187
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:55,770
報紙入邊指出，佢哋都考慮過，如果咁做嘅話咧，其實同成個誒改革本身嘅方向係有一個分歧喺度。成個改革嘅重點就係話，讓雙方係更好地去體現佢哋嗰個合約嘅意願。咁如果係透過我哋呢個法例嘅修改，係令到縱然雙方並非想係噉嘅。

188
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:15,780
情況誒並非想將有關嘅誒利益係讓第三者透過法庭嘅程序去執行，都喺呢個誒條文入邊去實施嘅話咧，其實係誒並不恰當嘅。其實當然法誒消費者協會其實佢呢個提議背後嘅考慮係希望有一個誒喺誒從個保障嘅角度嚟睇。

189
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:35,790
但係，對於今次呢個誒條例草案入邊個重心係去體現更好體現雙方嗰個合約意願嘅時候咧，我哋都係認同誒法律改革委員會嘅諗法，就係話唔會係超越呢個即係原則噉樣。咁所以嗯呢點我哋係想表達翻嘅。咁至於剛才Professor Mason提到關於

190
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,550
誒。

191
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,770
誒兩方面，一個就係關於誒。

192
00:42:40,310 --> 00:43:00,320
個仲裁嘅條文嗰度誒係經過思考之後誒，瞭解到佢係表達即係認同嘅，因為尤其是睇到英國嘅判例之後誒，我哋亦都係喺近期嘅考慮之中咧，亦都係加強咗有關嘅條文。咁但係至於第二個問題就係關於mediation，即係誒調解同埋關於誒我哋呢個即係。

193
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:10,130
犯案入邊嘅第十三條講到exclusive jurisdiction專有司法管轄權條款兩方面嘅問題。誒，首先就mediation誒。

194
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:30,540
調解方面，我哋係冇一個獨立嘅條文去處理呢方面。誒，冇錯，呢度的確係嘅，因為誒，我哋喺法律改革委員會入邊嘅報書，其實佢哋都冇具體建議，反而佢哋唯一除咗仲裁條款之外，佢哋係加咗關於呢個所謂誒專有司法管轄權條款喺入邊。誒，所以我哋冇誒擺落去。當然，我哋都考。

195
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:50,550
考慮過會唔會即係額外表達落去咧？噉樣咁其實我哋最後都睇翻就係成個草案入邊嘅第四條嘅第四款嗰度，其實嗰個大原則已經寫咗喺度，就係話如果要第三者要強制執行有關嘅條款嘅時候咧，佢係需要受到有關合約中同嗰個條款有關嘅任下其他條款。

196
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:56,270
誒有規誒，所有嘅規限係要根據翻嚟做。咁如果係嘅話，譬如話，如果

197
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:16,560
嗰個合約本身係表達咗出嚟嘅內容，就係話，如果要執行有翻嘅權益，係需要透過先有個誒調解，先有個mediation進行先嘅話咧，咁其實係根據第四條第四款咧，係要統定要做翻呢個程序。咁所以我哋係會依賴第四條嘅第四款，因為其實我哋都瞭解到，其實唔止係。

198
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:36,570
仲裁唔止係關於誒呢個專有司法管轄權嘅條款，其實可以有其他，尤其是喺建築業界入邊，可能有其他去處理誒糾紛或者爭議嘅條款，其實都可能會規範到個權益嘅行使。咁所以我哋覺得用第四條第四款作為一個大原則去處理咧，係會較為恰當。咁至於講翻第十三。

199
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:56,580
條講到呢個exclusive jurisdiction clause專有司法管轄權條款，誒，我哋都注意到呢個條款其實誒係誒法律改革委員會比較誒獨有地提咗話，應該係直接處理呢個問題。當然，我哋都相信第四條第四款本身已經將嗰個大原則係表達咗出嚟。咁誒，第十三條誒。

200
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:03,470
現時嗰個誒條例草案已經係一個比較細緻地表達咗出嚟。嗯，我哋。

201
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,310
覺得嗰個原則仍然都係話唔會係單方面將嗰個誒。

202
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:29,660
責任或者burden係交畀第三方嘅，始終係要用翻第四第四款個大原則，就話有一個利益，而呢個利益本身有一啲條件喺度。所以如果譬如話賦予呢個第三方係有一個利益，就話可以爭出根據個合約攞到某啲權益嘅時候，而呢個權益本身背後係有一啲附帶嘅條件，包括話要用一個專。

203
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:45,930
有司法管核權嘅條款嘅時候咧，噉就需要用翻呢個誒條款去進行。咁所以亦都係誒同成個第四條第四款或者成個條例草案嗰個精神係一致。多謝主持。好，唔該，黃生。Aden繼續。主席，我想再跟進一下。我知道嗯。

204
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:53,350
perhaps I'll do this in English, Professor Mason. I understand that you've done quite a bit of research into the areas of consumer protection.

205
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,420
是 part of your discipline， and I just want to know whether you think the present bill

206
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:20,710
Has sufficient, or whether it could do better in terms of consumer protection, Mr. Mason. Yeah. Thank you. Consumer protection is a an issue all by itself, and it's greatly lacking here in Hong Kong, sadly. I did have a quick look over the consumer council's

207
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,630
submission here.

208
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:44,550
But the problem is that what they're recommending, and in their submission, is that I think it's already been alluded to before. This would not be respecting the intentions of the contracting parties by widening the enforceability of of of this of of such a right. It would be

209
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:58,420
Too wide in scope, and it could arguably include an indeterminate number of potential third-party plaintiffs if we if we followed what the consumer council recommended.

210
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:14,320
Promiseaws would just start contracting out and making that quite standard, standard boilerplate. So rather than considering whether to contract out, it would be it would just become a like a boilerplate clause contracting out of the legislation.

211
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:28,030
但，as I said, consumer protection law is lacking here. But this this is a matter for a separate bill. It's not something I don't think that should affect this third party rights bill in front of us today.

212
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:49,520
O.K.啊，下一位係啊陳建波議員。陳建波唔該，係多謝主席。我就唔係呢個委員會嘅咁咧，但係都多謝主席畀我機會發言啦嚇。噉啊，基本上咧，我諗誒頭先政署都講咗啦，其實保險業聯會咧，其實喺誒一月啊二號嘅二零一三已經畀個信政府啊，就呢個。

213
00:47:49,810 --> 00:48:09,820
誒條例咧係係有啲意見，咁似乎你係處理曬嘅，即係聽講你都即係儘量即係配合咗我哋嘅需求啦。咁所以而家保險聯會係有封存嘅喺枱面，我諗你都有啦，應該係嘛？嗰度主要嘅目的就希望咧係政府確認下咧，而家喺根據你嘅條例下邊咧，你已經係處理咗我哋嘅需要噉樣。咁如果係你係。

214
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:29,830
個答案係yes嘅咧，噉我哋就舒服曬啦，就已經係解決咗我哋嘅嘅羣傷啦。咁但係都希望你係有一個書面嘅誒回覆畀本聯會。噉我我個責任就就完咗啦。如果你做咗呢樣嘢就，噉你可唔可以啊口頭同我講係咪都已經處理曬，定係話呢封信講嘢係咪事實咧，定係已經處理，定係仲未咧？你請你同我哋解解好。

215
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:49,840
係，即係喺枱面嘅係C.B.括弧四六四四一三一四零一號文件，就係五月七號啊，畀本人嘅係香港保險聯會。噉啊，黃生，你可唔可以口頭上講一講，或者你即係喜歡書面回應你？

216
00:48:49,840 --> 00:49:09,850
可唔可以講一講啊，黃生？啊，主席，多謝主席。就關於剛才陳議員提到嗰度咧，信件本身我留意到，誒五月誒七號呢封信入邊，誒一個比較正面關注嘅問題就係話會唔會排除關於即係誒保險嘅合約於呢個條約誒條例之外咧？咁其實剛才我亦都係就呢方面表達咗個。

217
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:16,450
意見亦都係考慮翻，即係法律改革委員會嘅內容。咁所以可以講就係，我哋其實係充分考慮咗誒。

218
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:36,740
誒保險保險業界嘅意見，亦都係睇埋睇翻呢個法律改革委員會，亦都一個詳細嘅考慮之後得到嘅結論。咁誒，我可以確認一樣嘢，就係我哋每一點都有仔細考慮，主要係咪完全可以跟到？我誒應該可以表達翻，就係未必係嘅。咁但係，希望能夠平衡到各方面嘅關注，以致做到一個好嘅條約。

219
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,830
條例畀到誒，即係社會大眾用到呢個即係第三者權利嘅條例草案。多謝主席。

220
00:49:43,670 --> 00:50:03,680
即係嗱，如果你可以完全排除，梗係最好啦。但係頭先你講得好清楚，你係唔可以嘅。但係我意思話，如果睇翻個conclusion嗰度咧，就係話，似乎喺你嘅法律入邊咧係有足夠嘅空間咧，令我哋保險合約咧係可以咧透過嗰個誒條款嗰個同個同個購買者有個協議咧係可以充。

221
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:12,540
份解決呢個問題，呢個先係我哋嘅重點嚇。係，多謝主席。如果係噉嘅話，可以確認到，因為根據誒草案嘅第四條嘅第一。

222
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:32,830
B款同埋草案嘅第四條嘅第三款結合埋一齊嘅時候咧，其實可以做到呢樣，即係話如果佢喺嗰個合約入邊清楚明文係想排除呢個第三者權利嘅條例草案嘅時候咧，係可以做到。但係當然，我哋亦都好希望就係話誒喺具體嘅情況，我哋個別嘅情況考慮咧，即係如果一刀切。

223
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:52,840
設將所都排除嘅話，其實就好似剛才Professor Mason所講，從誒如果係導致即係好輕易地即係排除嘅話，其實就誒未必係可以同呢個寵物。明白明白嗱，總最緊要就係話誒誒，你頭先你講嘢，你可唔可以書面復翻嚟？即係話我哋其實喺嗰個保單嗰個driving或者我哋同。

224
00:50:52,840 --> 00:51:12,850
我阿客户嗰個合約嗰度咧，係可以解決到呢個問題噉啊，得㗎啦嚇。呢個我最主要我得嘅。咁另外當然亦都有兩位係我哋保險界嘅誒代代代理人嘅嘅組織嘅發言咧，希望你都能夠充分處理咯嚇，咁可以解決咗佢哋嘅擔心，噉就誒，即係我哋就可以對呢嘢個呢個法例係比較放心啲。好啊。

225
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:23,990
陳傑邦，我容許我講少少關於保保單啦。即係其實你啊，如果你依個條例草案有個機制係排除曬所有，所以party rate可寫明咗喺個保單度嘅。

226
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:44,280
咁呢一個咧對你哋嚟講咧，我覺得我個人意見咧，未必一定係好事，因為有一啲嘅保險公司可能話：，誒唔緊要啊，我哋都平時都都都預咗㗎啦。噉你即係話咧，你如果話排除曬嘅standby play course，咁其實對你嗰個product嗰個marketability咧，其實都都有可能有影響，因為如果

227
00:51:44,280 --> 00:52:04,290
受益人原來係冇權去enforce，其實將來佢知道所有你公司或委某一間公司嗰個保單。咁呢個其實就唔係話嗰個純粹嘅法律考慮咯，我諗亦都係一個好緊要嘅商業考慮咯。即係保單嚟講，即係唔係話排除曬就一定對貴行業嘅嘅嘅發展係會有即。

228
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:24,300
一定嘅嘅嘅嘅裨益咯。我我嘅意見就係噉樣樣嚇。我諗呢個等翻佢哋即係做呢行嘅人決定啦嚇，因為因為佢哋一定會比較清楚。咁但係因為主席，因為我喺另外公務小組開緊會啊，唔好意思，我一路過翻佢先。噉我淨係即係係look forward to你個return reply to香港一派啦，係嘛。即係同埋我諗阿陳建波，我諗將來如果呢一個條。

229
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:44,310
例在過之後咧，希望你哋嘅保險從業員，無論broker、手agent都希望你哋可以向嗰啲即係買保單啲人士咧，係解解呢一個條例嘅嘅嘅精神啦嚇，即係要推售呢啲保保單嘅時候，同埋各位業界都都希望你可以咁做啦。咁下一位係阿李慧瓊議員，阿Sir唔該你。係唔該主席，亦都歡迎咁多。

230
00:52:44,310 --> 00:53:04,320
多位誒朋友今日嚟到我哋草案委員會畀意見誒，我想誒瞭解一下頭先秘書長回覆嘅時候咧，都講到建造業曾經有個擔心噉，現階段我起碼我掌握就係話基本上都處理咗誒建造業嘅擔心噉，我想確認一下阿葉小姐係咪事實？

231
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:24,330
都係如此咧，呢個第一。第二就係我想問一問，若然呢個條例按翻政府嘅建議咧，係獲得通過，對於政府嗰個合約嘅範本有乜嘢具體嘅影響咧？你哋喺現階段有冇諗過呢個問題咧？因為誒，根據我理解咧，其中一個。

232
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:44,340
關鍵就係你嗰個草擬合約本點樣寫，會唔會排除第三者嘅權利？咁頭先亦都有誒提問誒畀意見嘅朋友都講到，其實政府嗰個合約範本都係好重要嘅。咁喺呢方面，你哋而家初步嘅諗法係點咧？第三個問題就係誒，因為其實誒，如果從消費者嘅角

233
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,870
度或者從一啲誒。

234
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,860
小買家嘅角度咧，就係其實好多時候我哋簽嗰個合約咧，誒。

235
00:53:53,300 --> 00:54:13,310
個議價能力都好低，大家都明白嚇。極少消費者都係有噉嘅知識誒，去更改誒買方擺喺枱面嗰個合約嘅。咁喺呢方面，政府會做啲乜嘢嘅推動或者保障，讓到誒消費者其實知道喺啊？

236
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:28,420
啊！合約嘅草擬過程，佢哋其實係有權可以去啊，去加入相關嘅條款啦，或者點樣令到買方草擬合約嘅時候都會讓到而家呢個呢個第三者嘅權益咧，係啊，其實係可以反映畀。

237
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:48,710
誒消費者聽，正如頭先主席都講係嘛，即係誒買保單嘅人咁理論上佢都應該要知道，即係個個分別係點樣啊？我想了解下五句。好，首先我諗請阿阿葉小姐去回應翻阿李慧瓊議員嗰個問題先。好，唔該你啊。嗯，好多謝主席。噉我諗我啱啱表。

238
00:54:48,710 --> 00:55:08,720
表達過就係建築業議會其實就歡迎呢個條例草案嘅，咁但係我哋亦都理解到本身行業裏邊會有一啲持份者對於個草案會有一啲誒即係保留啦。咁但係我哋而家睇翻嗰個條例草案嗰個誒草議嘅方式咧，我哋就覺得其實佢都要睇翻本身你自己嗰個合約。

239
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:28,730
裏邊嘅條款㗎嘛，咁所以好似啱啱有一啲誒議員都即係提過，就係話，如果真係有一啲誒合約誒簽嗰陣時，佢覺得我真係唔需要呢一個條例嘅保障嘅話，其實佢自己可以誒即係去exclude排除咗呢個條例嘅誒對。

240
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:48,740
佢誒嘅有效性嘅，咁但係我就唔覺得我哋需要成個建造業就話要exclude from呢一個條例草案嘅誒，即係誒用用法度。好，唔該曬你。跟住阿黃生，唔該你回應埋其他兩條問題啊，唔該啊。多謝主席。剛才阿李議員提到關於話。

241
00:55:48,740 --> 00:56:08,750
會唔會喺政府嘅合約上高會就呢方面有啲處理咧？喺現階段，其實我誒誒代表唔到，即係相關嘅各方面係就呢方面表達意見。但係我誒睇到喺誒法律改革委員會嘅報告書入邊嘅第四點四五段咧，其實都就呢方面有一啲討論。當然背後其實個精神都始終係離唔開，就係話。

242
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:28,760
係要合約雙方佢嘅意願都係想將呢個權利賦予畀呢個第三方，好讓佢哋可以透過法庭咧係直接執行有關嘅權利噉樣。咁誒第四點四五嗰度亦都提到就係話誒政府因為喺唔少嘅合約上高咧，其實都有個角色喺度，咁所以會唔會透過呢個條例嘅通過？

243
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:48,770
之後，誒便利到雙方，以致更加好體現到雙方嘅合約意圖，可以將有關嘅權益係賦予畀誒第三方咧。噉我哋都睇到第四點四五本身想表達嘅意願喺度。多謝主席。誒，仲有第一，仲有第三條問題你未答，仲有啊啊李慧瓊議員，你佢答咗未啊？第三條關於消費。未嘅。

244
00:56:48,770 --> 00:57:08,780
消費者係啊，多謝主席啊。關於宣傳方面，其實我哋誒都係認同嘅，即係覺得去誒，我哋都會喺呢個條例通過咗之後，或者之前咧，我哋做，因為我哋預計都會有一啲準備功夫嘅時間啦。由法例如果能夠通過到實施之前，我哋上邊都表達過，希望最多限度有有冇半年嘅時間。咁喺呢段時。

245
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:28,790
間咧，我哋都希望可以，譬如話同誒相關嘅團體，包括律師會啊，或者喺呢個情況同呢個誒消費者委員會方面做一啲聯繫，睇下點樣可以即係有效咁推廣有關個誒即係條約嗰個情況，好讓即係譬如大眾市民啦，包括可能一般嘅誒頭先提到話即係誒小賣家或者。

246
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:48,800
即係誒消費者咧，可以能夠係知道佢哋嘅權益喺邊度。多謝主持。好唔該啊，Sara仲有冇跟進？唔該你誒有跟進嘅啊誒，唔好意思，我知悉你就律政司嘅律政處嘅代表誒政府合約方面咧，你係唔掌握嘅，會唔會都去了解一下？因為呢個其實都好關鍵，我亦都相信咧。

247
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:59,950
如果從政府角度，以至到承辦商嘅角度咧，會唔會有個動機咧？就係擺喺個條文內，就唔好讓第三者有呢個權力去追索啦。

248
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:20,250
會唔會有呢個可能性咧？係嘛，即係因為大家都唔想避免咁多claims。某個程度我理解，但係從第三者，即係我哋有時誒議員收到啲市民嘅投訴，即係例如好簡單，食環署同佢嘅外判商嘅合約噉，噉啊誒街市嘅狀況濕，噉啊啲市民跣低咗，噉啊成日都會話喂，其實佢哋咪有個權利去追。

249
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:32,370
討翻誒誒啲承辦商與至政府咧，咁咁即係即係第時喺政府個誒合約嗰個實質嘅影響係點樣咧？我覺得都值得去了解一下。

250
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:52,660
啊，黃生，或者你答唔到不不，你盡量答啦嚇。主席，我諗我可以將有關嘅意見係轉達翻畀相關嘅局，即係等佢哋瞭解翻。譬如話，議員有一個即係誒意見喺呢度，關於話即係將來嘅合約，但係因為現階段我估我亦都唔可能係即係代表到佢哋去即係表達個立場，同埋始終嗰個大原則係要喺雙方嗰個合。

251
00:58:52,660 --> 00:59:12,670
約嘅意願嘅情況之下，去將有關嘅權益係賦予畀第三者。剛才亦都提到一刀切，其實亦都未必係最好嘅事情。多謝主席。即係黃生，我諗即係將來政府嘅各種或者各個部門唔同嘅合約，即係可能對呢一個條例，可能係採準係唔同嘅處理同態度，呢個有可能嘅係咪絕對啊？

252
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:20,860
主席，我相信因為都要因應翻嗰個具體合約嘅處境去作出即係判斷。係。阿李慧瓊議員仲有冇問題？

253
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:29,090
噉就團體今日表達意見嘅發言，或者各位同事仲冇其他問題？阿梁家傑議員，唔該。

254
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:38,250
主席，我我理解就噉樣啊，因為其實喺好多誒合約裏邊咧，就立約嘅雙方咧。

255
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,070
係。

256
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:45,170
憑佢哋嘅合約咧，係為第三者係會。

257
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,620
製造咗一啲權力出嚟嘅。

258
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:57,240
咁當然即係，如果你話冇呢個條例咧，噉就呢第三者咧係唔可以。

259
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:04,250
逼令立約嘅雙方咧，係去誒履行。

260
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,600
就住第三者嗰啲權益。

261
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:18,100
嘅條款嘅，即係創造呢啲權益嘅條款。咁所以，我理解咧呢個誒條例草案咧，純粹係處理呢一個問題嘅啫。

262
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,240
噉就誒。

263
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:31,280
所以頭先啊，黃慶康先生咧先至即係三番四次重重新咧，呢個係建基於合約嘅喎，嚇。

264
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:36,310
噉我我兩個問題即係想問一問嘅，因為誒。

265
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:42,360
律政司嘅方面咧就答咗誒，我哋條例草案委員會喺上次會議。

266
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:49,980
嘅一啲問題就引咗有幾個，包括英國啊、新加坡啊、紐西蘭啲判例嘅。

267
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:56,230
咁如果睇嗰啲判例咧，尤其是英國嗰兩個判例咧。

268
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,630
就係。

269
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,320
只要。

270
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,020
合約裏邊。

271
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,800
立約雙方。

272
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,450
係冇特別點名。

273
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:13,750
去將一啲第三者排佢於外咧。

274
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,740
只要嗰個第三者係證實得到。

275
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:23,000
嗰個合約係對佢嘅權利同埋義務咧。

276
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:32,730
係會有所影響咧，其實法庭都會容許呢個第三者咧係要求合約雙方履行嗰個條款嘅。

277
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,340
即係旅行。

278
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,400
嗰個合約嘅效果啦，即係。

279
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:45,090
好啦，咁如果照呢啲判例嚟講咧，我唔知道外國嘅實施嘅經驗係點啊？

280
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,050
即係會唔會喺實施呢個條例草案之後？

281
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,010
喺一啲誒。

282
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,770
合約裏頭咧。

283
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,220
係有一個好長嘅。

284
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,150
嘅表列。

285
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,730
列出嚟咧就係。

286
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,510
以下表列者。

287
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:10,660
誒，合約雙方咧就冇任何意圖。

288
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,200
為其。

289
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:25,650
製造任何權利或義務噉樣啊，即係有冇啲噉嘅經驗啊？即係我我唔知道，因為我呢個係問題嚟嘅，真係即係因為我就睇翻啲判例咧，我就話如果我係律師。

290
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:35,960
咁而我個當事人咧，又係好想排除曬嗰啲有可能嘅第三者。

291
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,160
個權益。

292
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,650
噉嘅時候，避免日後麻煩。

293
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,280
會唔會有一個噉嘅現象出現？

294
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,090
咁如果呢個現象一旦出現，

295
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:59,610
咁呢一個條例草案所希望達至嘅政策目的咧，其實係會大打折扣嘅。

296
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,480
咁而喺呢啲情況出現之後咧。

297
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:09,890
我唔知外國經驗係點咧，係咪即係好似頭先啊Professor Mason咁講？

298
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,310
就要由另外一場合。

299
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:21,560
由一啲消費者嘅嗰個保障嘅法例咧，嚟到去平衡翻佢。

300
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:29,490
即係我所知道有冇噉嘅噉嘅先例，即係我哋可以有個心理準備啦嚇，作為立法者呢個第一個問題啊。

301
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:46,080
第二個問題咧，頭先我留意到阿阿阿黃先生咧，副法律政策專員咧，就有提到啊，就話有半年嘅時間，我其實聽唔係好清楚半年係點樣點樣出嚟，因為誒個條例草案本身咧。

302
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,160
就冇話有一個過渡期，或者咧係延後嘅。

303
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,820
生效期嘅。

304
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:58,190
咁嗰半年係咪話而家誒行政當局係諗住？

305
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,030
就算呢個條例草案過咗啦。

306
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,750
你嗰個誒？

307
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,820
即係執行。

308
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,890
實施嘅日期咧。

309
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:29,200
都會係定喺半年之後，抑或點樣？我想聽清楚少少，係喺兩個問題啫。係啊，黃主任何唔該你呢兩個問題。主席，關於就啊條例實施嗰度，因為我哋都係依賴第一條第二款嗰個內容，就係話到啊通過咗之後，其實決定幾時誒正式實施咧，會都係請律政司司。

310
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:49,210
長咧透過獻報公告咁喺上一次會議，我哋都表達就係初步嚟講，我哋希望最得閒到有半年嘅時間，讓啊業界啊各方面能夠充分嘅時間去準備誒，譬如佢哋嘅合約嘅範本啊等等咧，可以做一啲功夫，同埋我亦都可以做一啲宣傳嘅功夫，等呢個誒市民大眾亦都明白到個權益喺邊度。

311
01:04:49,430 --> 01:05:06,550
咁至於第二條提到關於話即係嗰個實踐嘅情況，誒，我哋瞭解就係誒外地的確係，譬如話攞英國作一個例子，的確係喺嗰個實施上高度會出現啲情況，就係話佢哋可能會有一啲誒標準嘅條文咧，將誒。

312
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:26,840
有關嘅合約咧係不適用於即係第三者，亦都有可能。但係亦都有啲情況咧，可能係能夠清晰地表達，就係將嗰個權益咧係賦予畀邊啲單位，就唔會誒賦予畀其他人士噉樣。咁所以喺具體嘅表述上高咧係可以係透過合約去表達。咁但係都翻翻去最基本嘅問題，就係剛才梁宇亦都表達。

313
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:46,850
就係成個嘅法律草案建議嘅精神，都係希望可以更好體現合約雙方嗰個合約意願，就係話佢希望讓第三方可以透過呢個合約，透過法庭嘅程序咧去執行有關嘅權益。喺目前嘅法例上高咧，喺普通法或者係誒情況之下咧，其實係誒基本上係唔得，除咗係有一啲。

314
01:05:46,850 --> 01:06:02,450
例外嘅情況，咁所以我諗呢個一個比較大嘅改革係去開放咗呢個可能性，係更加好體現雙方嗰個立約嘅意願。多謝主席。主席，短嘅跟進咧，第一咧就係嗰半年咧係誒。

315
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:09,450
點咗定出嚟？點解唔係七個月？點解唔係五個月？點解係半年？係咪即係有啲基礎㗎？係嘛，即係同。

316
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,580
同嗰啲相關嘅誒受影響嘅人咧，即係譬如佢要。

317
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:36,870
審視佢現行嘅合約，噉係咪即係律政司方面已經係瞭解咗？即係佢都覺得半年係足夠嘅，即係唔唔需要太長咧噉樣，更加長咧。第二咧，我就其實我都想跟一跟嗰度。當然我知道成個精神咧係一個合約嘅。

318
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:40,240
精神啦，即係你係用個合約嚟到去做。

319
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,860
誒，做事啦。

320
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:48,120
咁但係我就想問下啦，譬如你有個合約咧，阿A同阿B立嘅。

321
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:54,600
咁明明咧，就係要為私製造一個誒。

322
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,000
權利嘅。

323
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:02,200
即係譬如好簡單，譬如舉個例啊，譬如我我而家同阿郭榮亨立約。

324
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,940
就話咧要誒。

325
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:12,060
啊！主席咧係可以得享嚇，我同啊郭榮亨議員嘅。

326
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:19,710
誒有一個有一個交易嚇裏邊，譬如我我話我買架車畀佢咁咧。

327
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,580
咁咧就話主席咧可以喺三年之後咧就獲得嗰架車嘅噉樣算咧？

328
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,030
咁但係咧就誒？

329
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,750
我雖然好明顯咁寫咗喺度嘅。

330
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,340
但係，我又有個條文。

331
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,690
就當我同郭榮亨立約嘅時候，就話明梁繼昌先生咧。

332
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,720
係絕對喺任何情況之下都不能。

333
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,210
去執行呢個合約嘅，咁如果照誒？

334
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,110
嗰個。

335
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:55,240
外國啲判例咧，即係行過呢一類噉樣嘅。

336
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,890
誒政策嘅。

337
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,710
判例咧。

338
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,540
容唔容許嘅？即係呢一個。

339
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:10,330
即係出爾反爾，而且咧係喺同一合作裏邊，明明咧就係為第三者製造咗一啲權益。

340
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:15,290
但係咧，同一個合約裏邊有一個條文，就係唔。

341
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:21,560
容許呢個第三者執行嘅呢啲噉樣嘅誒條款咧。

342
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,000
會唔會係法庭都？

343
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:28,280
照樣去執行啊！

344
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:48,730
我我想知道係係，因為呢個呢個嚇，我想問下呢位黃生有冇一啲判例？主席就啊呢方面，其實我就留意到法律改革委員會喺第報書嘅四點三六段入邊都討討論過關於呢個問題。嗯誒，意思即係話咧，佢即係約誒大概討論過呢個問題啦。因為喺第四條嘅草案嘅第四。

345
01:08:48,730 --> 01:09:08,740
條嘅第一款入邊咧，就提供咗兩個可能性，就係一A同埋B。一就係話真係講到明呢個第三者係有權去透過法庭嘅程序執行有關嘅權益。第二個情況咧，就只係賦予一個權利。咁喺呢個情況之下咧，就有個空間去判斷究竟有冇意圖將嗰個權利提升到係可以透過法庭去執行咧。咁呢度就

346
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:28,750
會出現咗第四條第三款嘅情況出現。咁喺第四條第一款A嘅情況咧，根據法律改革委員會個分析就係話，如果佢喺個條文入邊明文講到明係賦予第三方有權去透過法庭嘅程序執行相關嘅條款嘅時候咧，喺邏輯上嚟講咧，其實唔係太可能法庭會有結論話佢可以喺另外啲條款。

347
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:48,760
去排除嗰個即係誒執行嘅可能性，反而係喺佢冇明文去表達嘅。剛才梁議員提到一啲案例嘅時候咧，喺呢個情況之下咧就會出現嘅情況就係去判斷究竟有冇呢個合約嘅意願喺度咧噉樣。誒，由於誒只可能就係話喺誒誒第一條第誒第四條第。

348
01:09:48,760 --> 01:10:08,770
第一款嘅B嗰度提咗就話賦予呢個利益嘅時候咧，就要結合埋第四條第一款嘅誒，同埋第四條第三款去表達，就係話除非即係雙方係清晰地表達到就係話其實係冇呢個意願，否則咧嗰個誒法庭嘅推論就係話佢哋係想賦予呢個第三方呢個利益咧，係可以透過法定嘅程序。

349
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:28,780
執行噉就誒，希望可以回應到剛才梁議員嘅提問。誒，可以可以。至於第二條係關於話，即係做一啲問到就話嗰六個月嘅基礎喺邊度咧？噉樣誒，其實誒，我哋上次表達就話，我哋初步嘅諗法咧，係希望有最得閒到有六個月嘅時間。咁當然一方面，我哋都理解到業界嗰個需要啦。另外一方面，其實喺

350
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:48,790
第報告書嘅四點一九零段咧，亦都表達咗就係話誒，其實都有一個合理嘅時間，因為今次嗰個條例咧係廣泛地影響到即係合約即係各方啦。咁所以希望都有一個充分嘅時間，無論去提升即係公眾認識呢個草案啦，或者係畀業界係有足夠嘅時間。咁所以我哋去判斷，有冇六個月，希望係。

351
01:10:48,790 --> 01:11:08,800
有一個合理時間，但係我哋上節都表達咗，就希望如果今次嗰個即係公眾即係聽證會上，如果有其他意見，需要長啲時間，我哋可以即係充分考慮。多謝主席。好，主席，即係最後跟跟埋呢度啫。即係我我就想都係好好多謝阿阿阿專員嘅答案啦。即係其實簡單嚟講。

352
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,210
咧就係。

353
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:27,500
要呢個條例草案實施之後，要草翻一套法庭判例咧，我諗先至可以大概即係清晰一啲嗰個端倪。咁但係因為我哋始終唔係先行者啊嘛，即係有啲先行者噉，佢都行咗十零年嘅。

354
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,930
誒，如果我哋，

355
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:50,220
即係作為呢個跟循跟隨者咧，誒有冇可能喺立法過程都誒瞭解多少少？譬如喺誒其他地方措到嘅判例，有冇啲乜嘢我哋可以憑我哋嘅成文條例咧係處理埋，令到佢更加完。

356
01:11:50,220 --> 01:12:00,360
完美咧噉樣，即係呢個，我覺得律政司可唔可以都幫我哋手誒提供一下呢一套誒，即係喺其他司法管轄區。

357
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:17,670
行過相類嘅條例而儲到嘅一啲判例咧，喺普通法裏邊，誒誒，當然我我知道有個文件，即係今日都拎咗嚟嘅，咁但係嗰個我相信唔係一個即係好誒。

358
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,210
徹底。

359
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:28,400
即係叫做誒完完全完全嘅一個一個誒收集嚟㗎嘛。

360
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:45,580
唔知可唔可以啊，專員可唔可以幫幫幫我哋做下呢樣嘢，都係令到我哋作為立法者嘅角色咧，係可以更加心安一啲，同埋咧係冇乜嘢係我哋可以做而遺漏嘅咧，主席。係黃生唔該。

361
01:12:46,150 --> 01:13:06,160
啊！主席，其實誒，剛才梁議員提議嗰個做法，我可以啊表達翻就係誒，的確我哋同議員一樣，我哋都其實覺得需要參考誒海外嗰個實施嘅情況喺呢方面。我特別即係譬如話，因為我哋個法案其實同英國嗰個係都相當相似。

362
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:26,170
咁所以，我特別譬如話，當舉個例喺誒Professor Tritle佢寫《Law of Contract》即係合約呢本書入邊，其實喺第誒六百八十三頁之後，其實誒打後其實都有一個比較詳細嘅討論，亦都引述咗好多案例去介紹嗰個具體執行嘅情況。噉我哋都希望即係其實呢啊呢一類嘅參。

363
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:46,180
參考資料其實我相信亦都啊法律界嘅朋友亦都唔會難揾到。至於喺推廣嘅層面上講，我哋希望到啊稍後做功夫嘅時候，希望能夠又能夠深入淺出去介紹到啊嗰個犯案本身嘅效力喺邊度。噉我哋希望呢個可以即係平衡到一方面，如果即係誒大。

364
01:13:46,180 --> 01:14:06,190
量去揾案例，其實涉及嘅資源可能亦都係一個即係關注嘅地方。另一方面，我希望即係透過呢類嘅誒參考書，譬如話頭先講trial嘅love contract本身，其實都有一個相當有分量、權威嘅內容，入邊都有相當多個案例嘅分析。同埋今日我哋誒提交畀即係法案委員會嘅誒文件入邊，都揀咗幾個比較。

365
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:13,410
重要嘅案例，咁其實我哋可以使用到誒，到真係譬如話起草有關嘅合約嘅時候，嗯。

366
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:26,560
受影響嘅各方咧，其實會需要仔細去參考相關法律，因為法例其實都誒實施嘅情況，法庭嘅判例其實都係喺個發展當中。好似剛才有代表都表達咗，譬如話關於嗰個誒。

367
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:47,180
誒仲裁嘅條款，亦都睇到新嘅比較新嘅英國案例，去睇到個發展，以致覺得其實今次我哋嘅修訂係恰當噉樣。多謝主席。係啊，主席，即係當然當然誒，我可以自己去睇title嘅。咁但係咧個問題就係咧，因為始終誒律政司咧就有專人咧係在去。

368
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:54,000
做呢個條例草案啦。咁其實我或者可以縮窄少少誒，我尋求嘅協助啦。

369
01:14:54,280 --> 01:15:04,070
就係即係，如果有一啲喺其他司法管轄區已經係誒喺普通法嘅判例裏邊判咗出嚟。

370
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:13,300
就係可以透過誒成文法嘅立法，係可以處理到一啲。

371
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:25,070
法庭已經表達咗，其實立法過程若果處理到或者處理埋呢啲嘢咧，係會更好啦。咁即係譬如有啲噉嘅表達咧。

372
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:45,420
咁咧就誒，我想知道咧，即係因為呢個我我係尋求協助嘅啫。當然我自己都會去做，因為我都有我嘅我嘅誒應該做嘅角色嘅。不過即係我就睇下，即係如果律政司既然都浸淫咗咁耐啦喺呢方面，即係如果係可以提供一啲誒方向性嘅誒。

373
01:15:45,420 --> 01:16:05,430
協助咧，噉我哋喺立法過程咧就更加圓滿啦，即係可以處理埋一啲其他司法管轄區普通法嘅法庭嘅判例之中經已明言係誒希望透過成文法可以處理到嘅嘢咧，噉我哋如果做埋嗰啲，咪更加好咯，咁解啫。

374
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:25,470
係係係，即係我摸到，即係其實可以表達翻阿梁家傑議員，即係話，如果有有啲司法管轄區已經一啲法庭係判咗一啲案例咧，即係其實嗰個判決對你而家現有呢一份嘅條文有冇一啲幫助或者澄清？嗱，甚至係一個技術性上嘅澄清都好咧。如果

375
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:45,480
如果你擺咗落去咧，係會令到將來個訴訟咧係減少嘅，或者行文咧係更加清晰嘅。會唔會喺呢個階段做咗佢噉就令到呢條條例重係更加完滿咧？即係你哋有冇諗過做一個咩exercise去睇一睇呢十零年間一啲好重要原則性嘅判例對？

376
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:56,020
而家你而家呢個行文入邊有冇一啲一些多嘅，甚至少嘅影響？如果你覺得係冇嘅，做咗exercise嘅，噉你就答翻我哋，我安心啦。都係同。

377
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:59,270
咁多年嚟，十幾年嚟嘅案例係。

378
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:19,560
冇底足嘅呢條草案，咁如果你未做嘅時候，就可唔可以去做一做呢個噉嘅誒舉措咧？啊，你係有時間㗎，啊，黃生唔該，啊，多謝主席。其實我諗好明白，即係梁議員剛才表達嗰個精神，其實誒，我可以表達翻就係我哋今次嘅草案本身，其實某程度上已經。

379
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:39,570
反映咗一啲法例嘅變化嘅，或者透過一啲案例本身顯生嘅關注喺度。舉例嚟講，第四條嘅第一款，當我哋講緊話去實施某一啲合約嘅條款嘅時候，究竟包唔包一啲免責嘅條款咧？噉樣其實我咧喺第四條第一款嗰個定義上高咧，已經係明文講到明咧，係包埋。

380
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:49,750
其實有一啲外國嘅法例咧，係出現嘅情況，留意到咧係冇處理呢個問題，以致會引申一個不肯定性。所以我哋其實喺今次嘅功夫上高咧，係做咗呢樣嘢。

381
01:17:50,030 --> 01:18:10,040
咁至於另外一個例子咧，就係講到關於雙重嘅法律責任嘅問題。第十一條嗰度亦都有一個類似嘅考慮，亦都參考翻法律改革委員會佢哋喺個誒建議內容，就係話去明文去表達，就係話唔會出現一個所謂雙重嘅法律責任。呢個其實英國本身嘅條文第十一條第二款喺我哋嘅草案入邊咧係冇呢個條款嘅，但係。

382
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:30,050
我哋覺得應該包埋落去，因為認同法律改革委員會嘅意見係清晰地表達咗，係唔會有一個雙重法律責任。所以我舉一啲例子去表達翻，就係其實呢個誒草案本身其實係已經係嘗試去做呢個功夫，但係我哋都明白，隨住誒海外嘅判例一路發展，可能會有更多嘅新嘅情況出現，都唔出奇。

383
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:44,340
咁喺嗰個情況之下咧，我哋都會睇下會唔會需要再即係去完善個法例。但係現階段我哋好可以做到嘅，其實我哋做咗呢個功夫喺度嘅。多謝主席。係，唔該曬黃生。阿Alan有冇跟進？噉我就有一個問題嘅，即係其實就係頭先講翻。

384
01:18:44,620 --> 01:19:04,630
section四一A同埋四一B兩個lim就係話the contract expressly provides that the third party may do，即係佢enforce個term同埋誒嗰個contract就係就咁去confirm個benefit呢兩個分別。嗱，其實我喺我嘅專業生涯入邊呢十年八年都睇過好多啲合。

385
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:13,300
約係有個exclusion clause，如果嗰個誒合約係受呢個英國法例去管轄嘅啊，咁即係話咧。

386
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:33,590
如果你嗰個合約入邊啊，我想問一問呢個問題咧。如果合約入邊係有一個express clause去畀個第三者去一個enforcement嘅right嘅，但係喺個合約最尾嗰度as a boilerplate咧，我哋雙方咧又exclude咗呢個條例嘅時候咧。

387
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:46,480
咧噉，法庭多數嘅解讀都會係畀翻嗰個第三者嗰個enforcement嘅right嗱。呢個我嘅印象或者係我解讀呢個第一點。

388
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:56,470
而第二點咧，如果嗰個合約只不過係提及咗第三者係有個利益，即係四一。

389
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:09,380
B嗰個lim嘅時候咧，寫一B，而個合約最尾as a boilerplate咧，係有一個clause去exclude曬呢個第三者權利嘅誒呢個條例嘅時候咧。

390
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:29,680
個法庭多數嘅解讀或者判決咧，就係跟翻替約雙方嘅意圖，即係話佢exclude佢。咁呢個嘅解釋係咪一個比較即係我覺得係合理嘅解釋啦？黃生。係，主席，我同意嘅，因為誒一方面我哋當然參考翻即係誒法律改革委員會第四。

391
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:49,690
點三六個報告書入邊都講出就話，如果喺第四條第一款A，即係嗰個嗰類型嘅情況，就真係講到明願意係賦予呢個第三方有權透過法庭去執行相關嘅權利嘅時候咧，其實應該比較難得到嘅結論就係話誒係想排除呢個即係誒草案嗰個效力喺度。但係正如主席所，

392
01:20:49,690 --> 01:21:09,700
講，如果佢只係賦予一個權益嘅時候咧，噉就會出現第四條第三款嘅情況，就要誒認真去判斷究竟有冇你意圖咧噉樣。咁而個法律嘅取向就係話，如果佢冇排除到或者冇清晰地表達到係唔想適用呢個條例草案嘅時候咧，就會可以透過呢個新嘅法律嘅。

393
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:14,240
架構咧去執行有關嘅權益，咁呢個係同意嘅，主席。好，唔該曬黃生。

394
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:23,400
誒噉就頭先七位團七個團體嘅發言啊，我各位委員仲冇其他嘅意見或者問題啦，係。

395
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:44,300
請你講下係多謝主席。誒，我有兩個好簡簡要嘅point誒，想同大家分享嘅誒。第一咧就係啱先都好多議員都有提到consumer誒contract啦。咁誒，我就會覺得主要有要分清兩大類嘅問題嘅，因為我哋今日喺度傾嘅主要係third party嘅，所以如

396
01:21:44,300 --> 01:22:04,310
如果話係consumer誒生一個誒agreement，但係咧係為咗benefit第三個party，咁當然係受而家呢個標嘅誒cover㗎。但係如果話淨係普通嘅我哋consumer市民去誒買嘢啊，有一個contract咧，咁啱先，因為有議員提到話誒要。

397
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:24,320
點樣誒去向啲誒consumer宣傳啊？噉佢哋點樣？因為佢哋又冇呢個知識，又冇呢個knowledge。好似話你啲咁多啲cases啊，點樣decision啊嗰啲誒咁點算咧？我覺得係會需要有宣傳嘅誒。咁做宣傳咧，其實可以用啱先阿梁演員嗰個誒諗法，即係話你可以用一啲。

398
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:39,350
案例嘅形式畀啲consumer知道，即係而家呢個係主要係講third party，比如話我哋為咗爸爸媽媽買咗啲乜嘢係畀parent去benefit嘅，誒咁呢個就係受呢個標嘅cover啦。呢個係第一，第二咧。

399
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:59,640
就彎線誒誒提到呢個十三條嘅呢個標嘅十三條，就係嗰個exclusive jurisdiction clause誒，亦都彎線。尤其下阿黃專黃專員啦，你講到誒其實係誒四點四啦呢個clause。噉我再仔細睇四點四咧，我就發現四點。

400
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:19,650
四係真係好Broad嘅嚇咁誒。我嘅問題就係話誒有冇可能話呢個四點四呢度咧會唔會subject to一個reasonable test，即係類似但係又唔同於即係嗰個exemption ordinance裏邊嗰個。但係你係咪需因為佢真係好Broad，係咪話誒？如果個pass

401
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:39,660
intention係話誒，你可以去enforce，但係咧，我畀咗啲好苛刻嘅條件嗱。咁嗰啲情況下，嗰啲條件誒，因為你嘅嗰個誒code嘅嗰個power咧，去改寫又係淨係關於recension啊誒嗰啲先有可能嘅。咁喺呢種情況下。

402
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:59,670
會唔會考慮即係話四點四會唔會會subject一個reasonable嘅test，即係你就算你雙方為咗第三人嘅利益，你設定嘅嗰啲條款，如果你有condition嘅，咁嗰啲condition係唔係要誒reasonable咧？噉樣嚇一個諗法啫嚇，多謝曬。好唔該曬，多謝你。

403
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:19,680
誒，黃專員你可以回應嘛？呢個問題誒，就兩點，一個關於推廣嗰度，我諗我哋都會誒，好似之前咁講咧，係積極考慮睇下點樣有效地推廣。譬如其實誒，較早前我哋通過另外一條條例，關於係誒持久授權書嗰個修訂條例嘅時候咧，當時我哋都同講香港大學嘅誒法律網。

404
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:39,690
站嗰度咧都做咗一啲合作嘅功夫，就係話喺網上佢哋誒邀請佢嚟幫手係去整理有關嘅內容，以致可以更好宣傳。當然嗰度就變成誒令到市民大眾都會明白個內容多啲。噉我哋都會誒積極考慮下，睇會唔會呢方面可以讓即係市民更加即係認識到咧噉樣。咁至於另外一方面，頭先提到關於第。

405
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:59,700
第四條第四款嗰度咧，其實誒冇錯，嗰個係一個大原則嚟嘅。咁誒會唔會有可能有一個所謂頭先講reasonable嘅test，關於合理嘅原則咧？咁誒誒，我睇到咧，佢其實最後我諗關鍵就係究竟從個相關合約嘅演繹上高，究竟係咪話嗰個權利？

406
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:19,710
係有一啲附帶嘅條件咧，噉樣咁呢個始終可能要交翻畀法庭去做一個判斷，就喺嗰個具體嘅合約嘅內容之內。咁但係對於頭先楊凡教授提到話，關於會唔會有啲情況其實應該有一個合理嘅考慮咧，噉樣其實呢度亦都同我哋之前提到就係話，我哋並冇跟到英國第七條第二款，關於話排除一回事。

407
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:39,720
喺豁免嘅免責條款嘅情況之下咧，唔適用相關嘅法律保障咧。其實我哋係誒冇跟到英國嘅，我哋希望仍然維持嗰個即係對於消費者嘅保障個條款咧，係可以適用喺度。咁所以誒，從呢個角度嚟講，如果從消費者嘅保障嚟講，我哋有別於英國第七條第二款咧，其實呢度希望某程度上係。

408
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:58,750
係誒反映到我哋嘅關注，但係另一方面咧，就係誒嗰個大原則第四條第四款咧，其實仍然無論喺英國嘅條文入邊咧，或者我哋喺呢度咧，我哋都覺得係都係需要由法庭去作出一個演繹，就係噉。當然喺個起草合約嘅時候咧，能夠清晰地表達到係非常之重要。多謝主持。好，唔該曬黃生。

409
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:19,590
誒係，你可以講。我clarify一下誒，我明白嘅，即係話係我哋係冇跟到英國嗰個誒exemption誒嗰嗰個誒七點二嗰個問題，誒，所以我先至會propose誒。我哋由於冇跟到嗰part，所以可唔可以考慮喺四點四呢一part咧？

410
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:39,600
反而係即係你係因為好broad嘅一個誒誒一個clause係咪會考慮加一個誒reasonable嘅一個condition入去咯嚇？就係正正係因為我哋冇跟到，所以你需要有一個地方可以去兜呢個底啦嘛係咪？如果唔係就好broad㗎啦，any condition係咪subject？

411
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,660
to any condition而唔係話誒仲有一個reasonable test咯，唔該曬，chief。好，唔該曬，多謝你。

412
01:26:45,940 --> 01:27:05,950
多謝主席。啊，始終翻返去頭先誒表達，我我諗我明白啊楊教授誒楊博士所講嗰個關注點，但係因為誒成個第四條個理念就係話去體現翻嗰個合約雙方嗰個合約嘅意圖或者精神。如果佢係想喺嗰個誒利益上高係加啲。

413
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:17,970
附帶嘅條件嘅話，其實我哋係比較難透過呢個條文咧去排除咗呢個合約嘅精神喺度。我舉一個例，其實我哋睇到例子就係話誒，譬如涉及到啊。

414
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:38,260
可能譬如話，嗰個合約雙方係願意賦予呢個第三者有權使用佢某條道路嘅，但係有一個附帶條件就係話要保持維修嗰個道路。咁如果呢個第三者並冇做到呢個工作嘅時候咧，咁呢個合約雙方咧係可以即係將呢個權益咧係取消噉樣。咁如果我哋再賦予一個合理嘅原則喺入邊嘅時候咧，就會複雜化咗問。

415
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:58,270
因為個合約雙方好清晰地表達，咁但係另一方面咧，對於嗰個第三方嘅保障就係，誒嗰個合約雙方並不可以向呢個第三方咧追討話，餵你冇幫我維修喎，要追討佢個賠償係唔可以嘅，因為唔可以單方面去追討，即係話我哋呢個成個制度咧係並冇單獨地賦予呢個第三方咧有啲法律上嘅責任，反而係如果佢。

416
01:27:58,270 --> 01:28:18,280
想用響個權益嘅時候咧，係有啲附帶條件喺度。多謝主席，唔該曬黃生。嗱，咁今日嘅誒公眾嘅聆訊咧，就到此為止啦。如果你哋冇交到submission，而想交啲誒書面上嘅誒信件畀我哋咧，我哋仍然會接受你嘅信件。希望你盡快畀到我哋啦嚇。咁如果你有新嘅意見，亦都希

417
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:26,240
希望你喺個書面嗰個誒信件度畀到我哋同埋我哋啲誒委員嘅，咁唔該曬啊各位先，唔該曬。

418
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,120
我今日都係講麥當勞。

419
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,990
因為其實有啲嘢可能畀佢哋搭翻消費。

420
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:22,720
啊！各位同事，噉就呢條條例草案，其實就而家。

421
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:43,090
今日開會時間十點半啦。咁頭先聽咗咁多團體嘅意見，咁其實就呢條條例草案入邊嘅政策嘅範疇，我諗希望你哋而家其實仲有時間表達意見，因為雖然我上次已經開始咗逐條審議，亦都係審議到第四條，但係我希望即係大家。

422
01:29:43,090 --> 01:30:01,300
如果有啲咩喺政策上嘅問題或者大方向嘅問題咧，希望就仲有呢啲時間咧，大家表達埋。我就冇一個意圖咧。今日我講明先啊，黃生就繼續逐條審議嘅啦，因為我都想睇睇你嗰個書面回應先嘅。噉啊～

423
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:12,580
如果各位委員咧，有冇意見？而家你你哋問埋或者舉手，要要發表咗就嚇，就係講政策嘅，就唔係逐條審議嘅啦。有冇？

424
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:18,450
嗱，頭先咧，我見到何秀蘭議員喺度嘅，我都想代佢問一條問題嘅先。

425
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:33,640
就係關於嗰個誒阿阿黃生係關於嗰個誒exclusion嘅clause嘅，咁應該就係第三第三第三節嘅喺嗰個條例草案入邊，藍之聰係嘅application。

426
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:47,080
咁喺誒第四段嗰度咧，就個ordinance就話就係呢個ordinance does not confer a right on a third party to enforce the term of a contract of employment。

427
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:57,560
against an employee，咁呢個好好清楚啦，就係against an employee，即係話咧個third party咧係會有一個。

428
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:17,950
Right去enforce嗰個即係contractual terms against employer嘅呢？呢個employer係咪即係仍然喺翻度嘅？Right嚇，冇錯，主席誒同意嘅。其實因為佢特別將誒僱員嘅情況employer排除咧，其實背後都係反映翻就係從個僱僱員喺佢之下嗰個僱員嘅保障嘅角度去做呢個功夫，咁所以係。

429
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:37,960
唔影響個僱員。如果佢作為誒，假使佢一個第三方嘅話，佢可以作出誒一個即係訴訟。但係當然，因為一般嘅合約下，或者佢已經係合約一方，就應該唔出現呢個問題。但係喺嗰個啊法律改革委員會嘅報告書四點一七七段入邊咧，佢誒都睇到有一個可能性，就係話當嗰個僱員被委派去一個。

430
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:53,440
第三方嗰度工作嘅時候，誒究竟嗰個第三方可唔可以利用呢個合約咧，去誒向呢個僱員提出呢個訴訟咧，或者執行某啲權益咧？咁其實誒之所以排除，背後都係想從個僱員個角度咧保障翻佢噉樣。

431
01:31:54,300 --> 01:32:14,310
嗱，即係話，如果如果誒好多時一啲僱員咧都有一啲所謂secret common arrangement嘅，即係去咗第三者一路工作啦嚇，暫時即係嗰個僱主就話哦，不如你去某一個地方，係比如係我client嘅去去做兩個月啦。咁即係話咧喺喺呢一個條例草案底下咧，其實嗰個僱傭合約嗰個雙方要要。

432
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:34,320
force against嗰個僱員咧，都係喺翻個原本嗰個僱主先可以做。就第三者就算係有個second arrangement都唔做得。但係如果當嗱咁好多時個second arrangement可能係一個tripartite agreement嚟㗎喎。即係我我我畀個例子就話啊，我僱僱

433
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,060
主A委派僱員B去C。

434
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:58,350
嗰個地方做嘢，咁為咗清楚表達呢一個關係嘅時候啊，啊喺個食common period入邊嗰兩個月入邊咧，誒C係可以要求B去做某某某事情嘅，咁已經三方面咧就有個third party嘅agreement，噉係呢一個係separate from嗰個僱傭合約，咁喺呢一樣。

435
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:13,230
嘢嚟講，即係你哋會點睇咧？係咪嗰個tripartite agreement係另外一個agreement，而係係誒係唔受嗰個僱傭合約嗰個個精神去去去規範咧？如果佢真係有噉嘅tripartite嘅economic arrangement嘅時候。

436
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:34,110
啊！多謝主席。如果嗯誒呢個情況之下，我理解就係話，其實三方都係屬於嗰個合約嘅方嚟嘅，即係都係一齊係個合同嘅嘅，即係嗯party啦，所謂其中一方噉。如果係噉嘅情況咧，就唔會用唔會需要用呢個第三者權利呢個條例，就直接係睇翻嗰。

437
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:40,940
個合約本身，呢三方本身承諾嘅權利或者義務去處理噉嘅，我同意嘅，主席。好，唔該。

438
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:56,980
啊，各位委員，係郭榮亨議員。即係誒，我知道局方係咪有啲書面嘅？係答覆佢係等緊嘅。咁如果係嘅話，我我相信唔係太適合而家做逐字審議，係應該。我冇我冇噉嘅意圖，我已經講咗頭先。你有冇聽書？

439
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,650
好，噉就。

440
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:11,280
如果大家都冇問題嘅時候，噉我就今日就結束今日嘅會議。下一次嘅會議日期咧，我就有幾個時間嘅，但係都係。

441
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,640
啊。

442
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:33,090
其中嘅日子就係五月二十號，大概係兩個星期之後嘅上午八點半啊。誒噉，我睇一睇大家嗰個即係我哋草委委員會嘅委員嘅嘅嘅時間，再再通知下誒各位。咁但係最早嘅時間係五月二十號，希望你喺五月二十號之前咧就畀。

443
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:42,200
畀到你應承嘅嘅嘅書面回應，畀我哋所有嘅文件可以齊備。噉我哋希望下一次開會就繼續翻啊逐條審議。

444
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:56,890
好，咁多謝各位同事嘅時間，亦都多謝政府。主席，如果唔介意，我表達先，因為誒，就今次嗰個表達嘅意見，可能個量都有一定喺度啦。噉我哋希望同秘書處可以協調下，睇下預嗰個回覆嘅時間係啊。係嗱。

445
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:08,540
如果冇二，如果五月二十號你哋覺得時間係好緊迫嘅時候咧，下一個可以開到會嘅時間咧，就係五月二十六號，五月二十六號星期一。

446
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:29,010
就畀多咗一個星期你。嗱，我哋再夾一夾啲時間，即係希望我哋各位財委會委員同埋即係啊政府方面咧都可以夾到時間。希望咧我哋有幾日嘅時間睇睇你嘅回覆。咁跟住，如果下一次開會，我哋再討論下其他政策上嘅問題。跟住咧就進入個逐條。

447
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:32,640
審議啊！下一次好冇？好，好，好唔該曬先。主席，係唔該曬各位。
