咁政府當局建議討論嘅事項就係實施法律改革委員會所作嘅建議嘅情況，以及B定立同埋專業法律團體有關嘅附屬法例嘅程序。周朱雙述A項咧，法律改革委員會，下稱法改會。

15
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:53,800
曾經係喺二零一三年六月就政府當局實施法改會建議嘅進展情況，向事務委員會提交過首份年度嘅報告。事務委員會喺零誒二零一四年五月廿七號呢，亦都就佢哋第二份年度報告進行過討論。法改會。

佢將會向我哋委員會提交第三個年度報告，匯報最新嘅進度。

17
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,530
就住上述B項。

18
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:22,050
呢個事項係回應咗二零一三年律師一般事務費修訂規則小組委員會嘅要求，事務委員會與政府當局及有關各方跟進訂立同法律專業團體有關嘅附屬法例嘅正確程序。

19
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:37,390
噉就首先，我哋要詢問下咧各位委員啦，在席嘅委員同唔同意我哋啊下一個會議，亦都係本年度咧應該係最後嘅一次會議，係討論上述兩個主要嘅事項。

20
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:57,820
如果冇反對咧，誒，我哋亦都咧係為咗個別嘅委員啊，謝偉俊議員咧，曾經係向本委員會要求，希望進一步跟進律政司司長如何監管華茂慈善基金一事進行跟進。我哋係列喺待議。

21
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:17,830
事項一覽表嘅第二十一項，我哋同律政司去討論過，佢哋咧亦都話，如果我哋委員係有興趣咧，可以準備喺下一次嘅會議，即係今年嘅七月二十號喺事務委員會會議上，同委員就住呢一個事宜進行討論。噉我都認為。

22
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:37,840
時間應該許可噉，如果大家有興趣，我將會擺入去下一個會議嘅事項。就住誒港深港高速鐵路香港段一地兩檢嘅安排誒，我哋嘅委員喺上次嘅委員會咧，亦都係分別超過兩位委員向我哋本委員。

23
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:57,850
會提出過，希望喺我哋本委員會提出討論。我哋同律政司討論過，噉佢哋咧其實都係願意討論有關嘅事項，但係咧佢哋再三就希望我哋委員咧係能夠理解誒有啲細節上嘅問題，佢哋需要一啲時間。咁咧暫時喺呢個年度未。

24
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:07,680
未必可以安排到，噉我哋咧亦都會去將佢跟進咧喺下一個年度。我認為一地兩檢咧都係我哋委員會好適合討論，我哋會跟進嘅事項。

25
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:27,970
至於啊，本委員會另一誒個議題就係啊，亦都係由謝偉俊議員提出嘅，就住佢想討論批准同埋拒絕保釋嘅事宜咧。我哋同律政司係商討過，咁咧就係請委員察悉咧，律政司係表示，雖然律政司係保。

26
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:47,980
息呢件事上邊咧係有其角色，但係認為批准同埋拒絕保釋嘅事宜咧，應該屬於司法嘅範疇，而司法機構表示佢哋係唔適宜係派代表嚟呢一度討論有關嘅事宜。我哋就住投訴司法機構嘅機制。

27
00:05:47,980 --> 00:06:07,990
咧，亦都一直有同司法機構係誒誒洽商嘅，噉佢哋咧亦都係同我哋表示咗，應該咧就係顯示一個比較具體嘅時間，係希望留待今年嘅十二月。噉我哋咧亦都係誒，你知我哋今屆咧誒有幾個事項。

28
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:28,000
係我哋特別關心嘅，其中關於有關司法機構嘅投訴機制咧，亦都係屬於我哋委員會咧，喺個別唔少委員係提到，噉我哋亦都會係繼續跟進。咁咧，匯報咗有關嘅討論事項之後咧，就進入我哋今次嘅誒正式嘅。

29
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,840
議程啦，噉就按議事規則第。

30
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,680
係好，黃一民議員係。

31
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:56,120
主黃毓民議員係唔係？因為你講抵過議。O.K.，佢舉手排隊，係按議事規則第八十三A條規定咧，各位委員就今日會議嘅討論事項，如果有任何直接或者間接嘅金錢利益，應該喺發言前披露有關利益嘅性。

32
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:03,210
噉我而家請咧，就係啊政府嘅代表，佢可以係啊進入我哋嘅議事廳嘅。

33
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:23,700
咁咧就相關嘅文件就係就住改革現行決定某項罪行應該由法官連同陪審團審訊，一或只係由法官單獨審訊嘅制度嚇。咁相關嘅文件係C.B.括弧四一一六八足十四-hi。

34
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:43,710
十五括弧零三係政府提供嘅文件，同埋括弧零四係由立法會秘書處移備嘅相關文件。而家我哋邀請刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師簡介政府就住事務委員會喺二零一四年四月廿二號。

35
00:07:43,880 --> 00:08:03,890
會議上所提交嘅有關改革現行決定某項罪行，應由法官連同陪審團審訊，還是隻由法官單獨陪審、單獨審訊嘅制度，係所得到嘅資料。跟住我哋會邀請咧香港大律師公會嘅代。

36
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,660
代表。

37
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,570
就住呢個事項發表意見㗎。

38
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:26,370
咁咧，首先咧，我哋就請啊政府啊刑事檢控專員楊嘉紅專員咧，係為大家簡介。嗱，由大律師公會嘅代表發言之後咧，我就會請各位委員誒發言嘅。

39
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:36,230
噉你哋亦都可以舉手嚇，趁住啊，第早讓我哋可以安排適合嘅時間。咁而家咧，我先請楊嘉雄專員請。

40
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,940
係唔該，主席。誒，各位委員。

41
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,530
喺去年四月嘅事務委員會會議上邊咧，我已經向委員會同埋各會員匯報咗有關議題嘅最新發展。

42
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,080
容許我喺現現在簡單地去撮要幾個要點。

43
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:12,670
首先，雖然喺法院喺過去嘅判例裏邊都已經確認，無論係根據基本法同埋香港人權法案，都冇賦予被告人選擇陪審團審訊方式呢個權利。但係刑事檢控科喺呢方面係絕對冇固步自封。喺過去幾年咧，我哋都多次同法律界去討論同埋誒。

44
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:31,170
參場希望可以探討誒更加優化嘅方法。喺考慮過去法律界曾經表達關注嘅範疇之後咧，律政司喺二零一三年九月發表咗新嘅檢控守則，將舊嘅檢控指引有關決定審訊法院嘅部分擴充。

45
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:46,230
去幫助我哋嘅檢控人員喺決定案件嘅審訊法庭嘅時候咧，能夠作出更周詳同埋全盤嘅考慮，以能夠選出最合適審理有關事宜，同埋有能夠。

46
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,880
係有足夠就住判刑誒嘅能力嘅相關法庭。

47
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,110
另外，新嘅檢控守則亦都特意提述咗《基本法》第六十八第八十六條。

48
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:18,590
講就係話，原在香港實行嘅陪審團制度原則予以保留。呢方面，我哋希望係有助檢控人員同埋公眾更容易理解香港呢方面嘅法法律體制。而就住委員會喺上次會議所提出嘅事宜咧，我哋。

49
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:33,630
都蒐集咗相關嘅資料，詳情已經向委員會係投提交嘅報告裏邊咧係詳列。我依度都唔花時間同埋唔花大家嘅時間去重去誒重新再讀翻一次出嚟，亦都容許我強調幾點。

50
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,170
第一。

51
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:54,170
就有陪審團嘅情況之下接受審訊嘅權利呢一個問題，我哋除咗從基本法同埋香港人權法案嘅方向作出咗進一步嘅分析之外咧，我哋亦都從國際公法嘅角度去進行咗研究。

52
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:05,640
歐洲人權公約嘅着眼點係如何令到被告人獲得公正訴訟呢個權利，而歐洲人權法院亦都確認。

53
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:18,230
各國有好大嘅自由選擇，採用邊一種方式去確保個國家嘅司法制度符合獲得公正訴訟呢個權利嘅規定。

54
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,820
我哋亦都就上述基本法第八十六條嘅效力進行咗分析。

55
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:32,220
嗰條條文無阻止對原本在香港實行嘅陪審制度作出改變。

56
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:52,570
但係呢個觀點唔係等於第一《基本法》第八十六條係責成香港特區有去重新檢視有關制度原則呢一個做法。政府嘅立場就係，如果係要認真研究對現行制度作出基本嘅改變嘅話咧。

57
00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:07,260
需要經過詳細而深入嘅研究，而有關嘅研究需要有強有力嘅證供或者證據去支持，喺區域法院採用陪審團制度，先至可以展開。呢個係我哋睇成係一個負責任嘅做法。

58
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:23,130
我哋亦都按委員會嘅要求，就喺區域法院採用陪審團制度所作所會有嘅預期，就住資源方面嘅影響，提交咗分別由司法機關同埋我哋誒律政司所。

59
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,450
誒而備嘅一初步嘅評估嘅一啲數據。

60
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:42,160
我希望指出，喺區域法院引入陪審團制度概念上，雖然好似好簡單，但係實際上對刑事司法制度嘅操作同埋有關單位嘅影響咧，絕對係不容忽視。

61
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,430
最後，誒。

62
00:12:47,360 --> 00:13:01,580
我根據上述所講，絕對唔係代表我哋對，或者由啊法官單獨審訊，或者由法官會同陪審團審訊有任何嘅偏向。

63
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,010
但係。

64
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,370
我哋亦都唔係話現在制度。

65
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:30,900
係唔需要任任何嘅優化，但係讓我重新重重新檢控人員嘅行事目標係從可提可供嘅選擇嘅審訊法庭裏邊選出最合適審理有關事宜，並能夠涉案罪行嘅刑責判處足夠刑罰。

66
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:50,910
嘅法庭，而雖然我哋喺二零一三年檢控守則裏邊已經引入咗指引，更清晰明確噉樣去就住選擇法院嘅政治嘅嘅檢控政策，但係我哋會繼續同法律界保持溝通，以希望能夠進一步改進檢控守則，能。

67
00:13:50,910 --> 00:14:10,920
能夠喺必要同埋可行嘅範圍裏邊咧處理法律界表達嘅其他關注事項。誒，多謝誒，好多謝楊專員。而家係請誒大律師公會嘅代表係誒蔡維邦先生。Yes，um，um，chair lady，um，members of。

68
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:31,120
This panel, I'm grateful to be given this opportunity to address you all on this matter. As just related to by the director, it is true that the DPP and his staff had been in communication with the bar and a.

69
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:51,130
幾年 ago， we did present some short representations listing out why， in the view of the bar， especially those criminal practitioners， that we we desire an expansion as to the scope of a trial by jury， and in

70
00:14:51,130 --> 00:15:02,590
特別，我們我們我們邀請這個 panel 考慮擴展至引入陪審團在地區法院。

71
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:17,690
Now, after I have been informed that I would be representing the bar in this matter, I have spoken to various more senior members of our profession concerning this matter.

72
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:37,980
And the message I was given that I should press on in this before this panel is that we want more jury trial. So I will try to speak on what I believe as the main factors that.

73
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:48,010
You should take into consideration. Firstly, I would ask you all to consider the jurisprudential aspect of this matter.

74
00:15:48,290 --> 00:16:01,480
The importance of having a jury trial resides in the fact that it's a division of labour between the judge of law and the judge of fact.

75
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:20,100
The difficulty sometimes that a judge of a single judge presiding over a trial is that he would inevitably he or she would inevitably be asked to decide on questions of law and also on admissibility of certain evidence.

76
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:40,390
所以，在我們現有的系統，例如在一個審判前，或在一個審判前，一個地方法官，地方法官會有決定可接受性，意思是他會看到或聽到證據，哪。

77
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:50,810
missibility he or she has to rule on, and that in in in the event that he or she were to rule against its amissibility.

78
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:59,680
then he would have to he or she would have to direct himself oneself to

79
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:11,150
not to have regard to the evidence which had been before him or her, which he had ruled inadmissible. Now, of course, you know.

80
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:30,060
Our system is that in such a in such a system, then he or she would be supposed to be able to really wipe his or her mind completely clean of the inadmissible evidence that she or he had seen.

81
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:44,200
Whilst you know this has been how our system works, it appears to us rational twenty first century citizens that there might not be any.

82
00:17:45,100 --> 00:18:05,110
neurological or psychological evidence to show that one can really do that, and especially for offences that could merit more than two years of imprisonment. That is to say, we're depriving a potential defendant of several years of of of his or her liberty.

83
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:21,940
therefore this division of labour between a judge of law and judge of fact is a point that we have to keep in mind, and that's the that's one of the merit of the system with jury trial.

84
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,760
then of course there's another matter.

85
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:40,020
一一一judge of certain seniority would have been sitting, let's say, in a district court for a number of years. Although there are a varie, there's a good variety of different types of offences.

86
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:49,890
但不可避免，他或她會被 presiding over trials of similar offences day in day out， and after several years and after hearing

87
00:18:50,170 --> 00:19:10,180
similar defences again and again, it is difficult to expect him or her to bring to the case when adjudging the facts, the freshness of mind. That oh, I've heard this again. Oh, I heard it last week. I heard it the month before. Of course, you know, we we at the bar fully respect our judges.

88
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:29,440
They are of they are they of the highest professional standards, but then they are also human. How are we to expect them to bring into a trial of an offence that is very similar to one to the ones he or she have been trying day in and day out for a long time?

89
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:49,730
That's why the the another major merit of a jury trial is that the judge of the facts would be able to bring in fresh ideas from their respective background. And nowadays, when we are talking about

90
00:19:49,730 --> 00:20:09,740
The composition of the jury, we are no longer talking about people who are extremely well educated, who are from a different social, from completely different social strata from the people they are trying, so they can see human frailty in a probably more

91
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:27,410
close and close manner, so that that that is that is another big merit of trial by juries, and and thirdly also still within this jurisprudential aspect, it's it's it's it's

92
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:47,700
quite important that we should remove this asymmetry between the prosecution and the defence. At present, the only party that could decide whether a defendant would be tried before the district court and high court, if it's a case that can be tried in both, would be the DPP or the secretary for

93
00:20:47,700 --> 00:21:07,710
and this is an asymmetry in the system that needs to be addressed. I do understand Mr. Young's point in his paper or in his department's paper that if we make the district court a case with that a

94
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:21,360
一一一一，陪審和判決庭，然後，也，不會有太多選擇，因為你知道，然後這些案件都是由陪審庭審理，但，是，最重要的事情是。

95
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:41,800
If we can remove the asymmetry of only the prosecution choosing which format a trial should proceed, that would that would let all sides to see that the system is impartial. There is no discretion just on one.

96
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:59,210
One side of the table. So these are the three main jurisprudential aspects. Then, secondly, I would suggest that trial by jury has another dimension of merits, and that is that resides in its social educational aspects.

97
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,130
The importance of

98
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:24,320
Undertaking jury duty in itself encourages citizens to participate in this public process, in public life in a way. Of course, members of this panel, you are all devoting time and energy into public work and etc. But actually,

99
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:33,050
There are lots of citizens besides exercising their vote, you know, in elections, etc. They have very limited participation in.

100
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:45,960
public life, and jury members introduce this element, and in and in a very important element, namely in deciding.

101
00:22:47,370 --> 00:23:07,380
什麼是right，什麼是wrong，什麼應該我們做一個公民，當他被指控犯了某種罪行，那回溯到遠遠的，不只到《麥卡託》或任何類似，那回溯到遠遠的，到公元前五世紀的希臘。

102
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:19,780
when when when they first experimented with a civil society whereby matters would be decided by citizens, of course you know all be only male at that time.

103
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:40,070
But but a jury service is also trial by jury was also introduced at that time, and throughout Roman times we see that Cicero etc. you know would would would try cases before a jury. The important thing about that is then the members of the public.

104
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:50,810
市民會參與，不單止在政治，亦都參與司法工作。

105
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,490
And that would.

106
00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:13,780
also help citizens to understand how a system runs. At present, we have I read from the papers we have a total full panel of around six to seven hundred thousand names on the on the list of potential jurors, but it seems to me.

107
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:29,170
That every year, probably only around a thousand or so, would actually have the privilege of serving on a jury. That seems to me to be unnecessarily restrictive. Of course, you know.

108
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:49,990
I'm sure members of this panel would have read in newspapers about how difficult it is to select a jury from a big panel in cases which are long, etc. But my experience, my personal experience in some of these longer cases, is that you can see that the members of the jury

109
00:24:49,990 --> 00:25:10,000
develop a cohesiveness, they actually develop a sense of purpose, and and I would just give one example. Of course, you would all vividly remember last September, I think on the 27 or 28, just outside your building here, there was this big demonstration.

110
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,710
and the next morning, causing quite

111
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:26,760
大 havoc in in in in Queensway Admiralty etc. I I was in the midst of a fairly long criminal trial. Probably by then it was the six sixtieth day or etc.

112
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:47,120
And but at ten o'clock that morning, no matter how difficult it had been for the jurors, some of them we heard live quite far away from from central in Emuji. Out of the nine members of of the jury, none of them was even one minute late. The court started.

113
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:59,090
at ten o'clock, so in in a way we could see that serving on the jury gave them a sense of purpose, gave them a sense of participation.

114
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,710
In.

115
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:21,310
in in the justice system, in the public life of Hong Kong, so that is again I would say a very important virtue. And expending jury service not only not only would would serve what I call the juris jurisprudence.

116
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:35,210
aspect of of the system, but more than that, it also helps to put more of our citizens to be aware of the civic duties and also that they will understand how the law works.

117
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:46,060
所以這些係兩大主要領域，我認為擴大律師服務對我們有利。

118
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,800
然後，第三ly。

119
00:26:49,560 --> 00:27:01,040
It may be a little bit more political, but of course, it's it's it's probably still a valid point. A jury verdict on either guilty or not guilty.

120
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,940
是 not a verdict by a single judge.

121
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,930
Now of course our judges, as I've said, are all of extremely high professional standards.

122
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,670
但still in the minds of a

123
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,260
common man on the street, a judge.

124
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:33,420
是very much seen as a person of the establishment. I mean, even though no matter how neutral we use the word establishment, he is a person of the establishment of a judge of the district court. So a

125
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,610
一一 jury verdict would not be seen as a verdict.

126
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,710
by a person from the establishment, but a verdict of.

127
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,120
just like。

128
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:57,470
Anyone on the street, and that is very important. Therefore, I believe that with the expansion of trials by jury to the district.

129
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:17,760
It would add confidence in the system that the system is not a is not a close set of system by well educated lawyers and and not just well educated lawyers but by the top of the profession you know who have become judges. It's it's not just that. It's actually

130
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,050
guided by these very top professionals who are judges.

131
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:29,460
Giving them correct directions on the law, but it's the common man, and it's a group of common man.

132
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:49,750
deciding on whether a fellow citizen should should be found guilty or not, so that is quite important, and that I would believe would also add to the belief in the international community that our system.

133
00:28:49,750 --> 00:29:09,760
Our rule of law is doing sound and well. So these are the three big aspect I would say why our bar is is is strongly behind the expansion of jury trials. But of course, you know, I.

134
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,900
我我 did have time to read the papers presented by.

135
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,540
The Department of Justice.

136
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:36,340
Of course, it's it's it's it's well understood that it would involve some escalating cost. But our our point is simply this: that given given the fact that our society is fairly affluent, it is

137
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:45,180
It is not right if we know that something, with all the merits I've just mentioned, should be done, but we

138
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,070
decide not to do it just because that we would be spending.

139
00:29:51,680 --> 00:30:11,690
More money, so that's that's how we look at it. But of course, I appreciate what the director said. It's it's a very serious matter. It merits serious thinking. And but I do invite your panel to seriously consider.

140
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:31,700
pushing this forward, maybe inviting the LRC to consider this, and then at that time, probably both the judiciary, the department and the private side of the profession could all contribute more meaningfully as to whether we should do it or the detail mechanism.

141
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:51,710
as to how that should be done. Thank you very much。好，多謝啊，蔡生。咁咧嗱，暫時嚟講咧，其實係連埋我係有兩位。O.K.何俊仁議員。咁咧，而家首先咧係黃旭文議員，我讀一次嚇，跟住係何俊仁議員，跟住仲係我嘅。咁咧嗱，由於咧我哋誒即係舉手嘅。

142
00:30:51,710 --> 00:31:11,720
嘅同事少咧，我就會比較寬鬆啲嘅。我哋呢個topic最長，我哋可以去到五點啊四十分。而我覺得呢一個誒議題咧，其實就係我哋嘅委員會好應該比較詳細討論。咁所以咧，我就建議每一位發問嘅委員，我哋現時係十分鐘咁誒就。

143
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:28,240
我哋有每一位咧，可以有十分鐘時間，好冇啊？噉我哋連問我而家暫時得三位嘅委員舉手嘅啫，咁最多可以連問連答十分鐘先。咁如果咧大家再想跟進，我哋可以再排嘅。咁首先係黃毓民議員，多謝主席。

144
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:48,560
誒，我哋聽完大律師公會嘅代表嗰個誒，即係調分理式嘅説明咧，同埋嗰個理據，誒，我哋更加堅定咗，即係我哋支持改革現行呢一個所謂誒決定某項罪行應由法官連同陪審團審訊啦，亦或係由法官單獨審訊嘅。

145
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,750
制度咁個結論咧，就係應該要擴展到去呢個區域法院嘅。噉我自己咧都即係誒。

146
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:07,520
有一啲睇法，噉就好多睇法咧，都係誒同大律師公會嗰個講法咧誒誒誒差唔多嘅啊。咁所以我聽完佢哋啲專業嘅人講之後咧，即係受過高深教育。

147
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,730
嘅。

148
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:19,820
頭先佢所講啊，受過高深教育嘅律師，跟住做法官係嘛？噉啊，同呢個普通市民嗰個分別係嘛？即係原來法官都係建制嘅一部分嚟嘅嚇。

149
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:37,850
嗱，雖然政府表示咧，即係對案件究竟係由法官單獨審訊，定係由法官連同陪審團審審訊咧，就律政司冇任何偏向嘅。但係我哋睇翻誒，即係頭先專員啊，或者即係之前。

150
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:58,140
即係呢個誒，我哋睇到啲相關文件咧。其實政府嘅態度咧就係啱啱就同誒頭先即係阿楊先生嗰個講法相反嘅。佢話我哋唔會固步自封，基本上你就抱殘守缺啊，大佬係咪？你講一大堆嘢之後，跟住你個理由就係話拿錢啦，好多嘢啦，要審慎啦。

151
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:07,210
係咪？誒，知事體大啦，因為一改，哇，即係好多嘢啦，係咪？技術上嘅問題啊，等等嗰啲。咁但係我哋而家講緊係原則啊嘛，係咪？

152
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:24,340
喺原則上係咪應該可以做得，即係應該要做咧？呢個先有一個最重嘅問題，應唔應該做，同埋即係幾時做，或者做得好唔好，嗰係兩樣嘢嚟。噉啊，大佬，而家講緊係應唔應該做，而家我哋就認為應該做嘅。OK，係嘛？

153
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:44,630
咁即係你就話冇咩偏向，但係你睇下文件第十七段嗰個總結，你就知道政府係唔支持任何改革嘅。啊，除咗以慣用嘅所謂行之有效啊嚟做理由去推搪之外咧，噉你就一定係列舉諸項額外財務開支或。

154
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:50,260
或者表示喺區域法院，如果引入呢一個陪審團制度咧，對整個刑事。

155
00:33:50,540 --> 00:34:01,540
司法制度嘅法理層面造成影響啦，呢個係你哋文件裏邊嗰個句子嚟嘅，對整個刑事司法制度的法理層面造成影響。

156
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,980
咁但係我就要即係回應你呢個講法。

157
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,240
第一一啲司法管轄區，好似加拿大、英國、美國。

158
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,570
喺有陪審團嘅情況底下，接受審訊係屬於被告人確立嘅權利。

159
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:25,810
咁唔通佢哋制度唔係行之有效咩？係咪？第二，政府一直堅稱由法官連同陪審團審訊。

160
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:46,220
還是由法官單獨審訊係不會妨礙獲得公正訴訟嘅權利，噉我哋就好難理解，正即係呢個改革建議點樣會對刑事司法制度嘅法理層面帶來呢個不良嘅影響，或者造成影響係嘛？噉啊造成影響，梗係講不良嘅影響啦，係咪？第三。

161
00:34:46,220 --> 00:35:06,230
至於講財務方面呢個影響係其次嘅，正如頭先大律師公會所講，餵你唔可以因為要使錢就唔做㗎嘛。更何況我哋一個富裕嘅社會，而家政府嘅財政儲備講緊七千幾億，係咪啊？你可以使多幾多錢啊？請問係咪啊？所以如果你因為錢嘅問題，

162
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:18,990
而去做咧，呢個係好大，即係好大個笑話嚟。我覺得，喂，維護法治同埋司法獨立，令到公義得到彰顯，呢個係首要嘅考慮啊嘛，係咪？

163
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:27,950
即係，我覺得政府對即係大律師公會頭先個講法咧，你都應該要有啲所所謂積極嘅回應先得嘅啊！

164
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:39,210
嗱，第二個部分我想講嘅咧就係，我哋理解中審法院咧就喺嗰個誒，我哋有一個case啊，張麗利訴呢個律政司司長個案件嘅裁定。

165
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:48,210
個裁定個講法就係好明顯，喺香港，被告人並沒有在有陪審團的情況下受審的權力。

166
00:35:49,080 --> 00:36:01,140
但係呢個有關嘅裁定係唔會妨礙立法會制定法律嘅，OK？將陪審團制度延伸到區域法院呢個觀點，政府當局係都係同意嘅，係咪？

167
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:21,430
文件特別援引《基本法》第八十六條，同埋中審法院喺律政司訴劉國輝案中就予以保留呢一個語句作嘅司法解釋。嗱，第八十六條規定，原在香港實行的陪審制度的原則予以保留。按照政府嘅理解，只要唔

168
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:30,570
唔係重大改變，以致佢成為另外一個原則，予以保留。呢個語句係唔會阻止對陪審員制度作出改革嘅。

169
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:42,600
嗱，相比於其他嘅普通法管司法管轄區咧，我哋嘅區域法院同埋裁判署嗰個定罪率咧，持續九成以上。

170
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:50,520
特別係裁判司處添，係咪啊？好似我哋嗰啲成日動節，畀人告非法集結嗰啲入緊嘅，基本上係係咪？

171
00:36:51,180 --> 00:37:11,190
個數字啊，非常之驚人，係嘛噉，於是就不免令人對區域法院同埋裁判司處嘅公正性產生疑問。呢個正常嘅係嘛嗱，仲有一種情況，我哋睇到嘅部分嘅刑事案件咧，個被告因為喂選擇認罪就可以講下數，即係判刑上邊有啲折扣，係咪？

172
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:24,940
咁如果你將個陪審員制度延伸到區域法院咧，嗱，肯定可以矯正呢種觀念嘅喎，係嘛？咁呢個對維持法治、捍衞司法獨立、彰顯公義，非常之重要，係咪？

173
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:45,310
嗱，仲有咧就係過去陪審團制度，只係喺高等法院係嘛，即係殖民地時代嗰個所謂最高法院實行，或多或少咧就係對嗰個社會狀況嘅一個妥協。嗱，當時嗰個教育同埋英語嘅水平達標嘅人口咧，就真係確實不多，係嘛？

174
00:37:45,310 --> 00:38:05,320
但係而家大部分嘅區域法院嘅刑事案件都用中文嚟進進行審訊，係嘛？市民嘅教育水平亦都普遍提高，客觀上已經具備條件對陪審團制度嘅涵蓋範圍作出檢討，即係話頭先大律師公會斬釘截鐵講嘅強烈支持。

175
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,390
將佢擴展到呢個區域法院。

176
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,120
誒。

177
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:24,840
法官同埋陪審團存在分工，嗱，另外一個角度，我哋噉樣睇，法官係處理法律問題，而陪審團係負責事實方面嘅裁斷。頭先大律師公會都講咗啦，分工可以減少陪審團。

178
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:31,090
受到偏見而法律上又唔能夠呈堂嘅證據嘅影響。

179
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:51,380
嗱，舉例嚟講，即係如果喺嗰啲不設陪審團嘅法庭，法官係需要處理被告嘅招認能否呈堂。假設佢裁定嗰個招認係非自願之下作出，而又唔能夠呈台成為證物嘅，噉你點樣確保之後作出嘅定罪？

180
00:38:51,380 --> 00:39:02,780
最裁決係冇受到呢一個招認嘅影響咧，由此可見陪審員制、陪審團制度，即係至少啊，相對嚟睇係比較公正嘅啊。

181
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:23,070
嗱，最後一點我想講嘅咧，就為咗減少對財政同埋制度嘅負擔，或者政府係噉樣做嘅，你可以區域法院刑事案件嘅被告人先由呢個即係做做開始先，即係區域法院嘅刑事案件嘅被告人選擇由法官單獨審。

182
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:40,690
審或者由法官連同陪審團審訊，你都可以試行，即係可以喺呢個即係先行一步噉樣都得。嗱，即係總言之咧，即係我覺得啊，誒政府其實誒係唔應該再用呢一個所謂誒財政資源。

183
00:39:40,970 --> 00:40:00,980
或者你喺文件裏邊所講嘅，我涵蓋四個字咧，叫知事體大，要審慎研究，即係唔好再用呢一啲噉嘅理由嚟，即係去作為一個啊，即係抗拒啊，即係特別係大陸書公會頭先，我覺得佢哋嗰個意見已經係非常之清晰嘅啊，即係我。

184
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:20,990
我雖然係一個立法會議員，我唔係一個專業嘅嚇，即係法律界人士。我哋呢度好多啊，係咪咁？但係我都覺得，即係我哋從一個即係普通市民啊嗰個即係常識嘅角度嚟睇，佢呢個係一個非常之合理嘅改革嚟嘅。政府係冇必要去阻撚呢個改。

185
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:41,000
黃一鳴議員留翻少少時間畀專員都回應下，佢係想你回應某一啲問題，係好唔該誒主席誒，多謝黃議委黃議員嘅意見誒幾點回應，第一就住錢資源方面咧，我同意嘅誒，重點就係一個刑事審訊程序嘅公正性，錢。

186
00:40:41,000 --> 00:41:01,010
同埋資源咧，絕對係一個次要嘅考慮。啊！我呢度都想澄清同埋補充一點，我哋今次喺個文件上邊提出資源咧，係應上年誒四月委員會我哋討論嘅時候咧，誒有委員話要求誒就住係改革呢一個陪審團制度所牽涉嘅公堂同埋所牽。

187
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:21,020
牽涉嘅各方面影響咧，希望得一啲背景資料噉，所以咧喺呢度我哋提出一啲背景資料。我我誒，我重複，我同意誒，錢唔係可以取代公義嘅第一點。啊，第二點就住頭先啊，黃議員其實某程度上邊都係誒引納。

188
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,820
咗大律師公會阿蔡大律師所提出嘅嘅誒理據嘅喺呢一方面咧，正如我哋喺文件所講。

189
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:43,700
誒，我哋係冇特別嘅偏向，所以我以下所提出嘅咧就係就住阿蔡大律師嗰啲所提出嘅觀點咧，做一啲另外嘅一啲嘅睇法，從呢個角度去睇嗱。首先，嗯。

190
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,990
蔡導師就住話。

191
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,850
法官同埋陪審員分工一樣嘢。

192
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,710
啊！第一，即使喺外國。

193
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,380
有。

194
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:16,880
被告人可以選擇陪審團誒呢個審訊制度嘅國家裏邊咧，都唔係唔會有任何一個國家所有嘅刑事審訊咧，都係有都係有呢種情況。一定個所有國家咧，都係就住有一啲控罪咧，係由法官獨自去聆訊嘅。

195
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:36,890
咁所以，全世界嘅嘅刑事制度咧，都係建基於係需要相信法官有呢一個專業嘅判斷同埋專業嘅能力，就住一啲佢雖然聽過，但係唔應該再記住嘅嘢咧，將佢撇除摒除於佢腦裏邊。呢個係一個最好基本嘅信任。

196
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:56,900
任法官同埋信任佢哋專業資格嘅一個啊概念，而係全世界咧都係噉樣去接受嘅。好，專員嗱，唔好意思打斷你咧，陣間我哋會再有時間畀你。嗱，噉你記住啊，黃毓民議員提過嘅問題，我首先要畀咗啊何俊仁議員係啦。噉你都可以繼續發問。我諗唔好斷咗專員。唔好斷咗，你想聽曬佢。

197
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:04,990
佢講係咪？想聽聽埋佢講啦。好，噉你係咪畀時間佢？我畀佢啦，等佢多啲。畀你答埋先，佢再講。好。誒，多謝。嗯。

198
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:25,340
嗱，即使誒，我講到頭先，阿阿阿蔡大律師嗰個法理上面嘅依據嘅第一點，誒，第就住嗰同一點嘅另一個諗法咧，亦都係即使喺現今世代就住陪審員咧，誒，越嚟越法庭同埋公眾係相信，即使陪審員。

199
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:45,350
咧都可以就住一啲佢聽咗唔應該聽嘅嘢，佢可以秉諸老外係越嚟越相信陪審員有啲噉嘅能力。而當我哋現今嘅制度係相信陪審員嘅話咧，更加應該要相信一個專業嘅法官嗱。第第二點就係話哦噉，法官聽咗咁多年，會唔會聽到有啲麻木咧？噉樣。

200
00:43:45,350 --> 00:44:05,360
可能會，但係從另一個角度咧，呢個亦都係代表個法官喺就住佢經常接觸嘅案件裏邊咧，有充分嘅經驗去就住一誒證人啊、被告人所畀嘅口供嘅可信性各方面咧，去作出一個誒有理智、有經驗嘅一個裁決。呢個係。

201
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:25,370
另一個角度嘅睇法，噉我哋從我哋可以亦都問誒，當一個法官去考量一個被告人或者個證人講嘅説話係咪可信嘅時候，需要有啲乜嘢引用啊？蔡大律師所講fresh ideas咧，噉樣可能咧更重要嘅就係佢嘅經驗。嗱，第三點就住。

202
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,850
被告人同埋控方嗰個誒。

203
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,360
不對稱性，disymmetry。

204
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:42,700
誒第一，誒我諗大家都會明白呢個喺個法理上邊，根據基本法第六十三條。

205
00:44:43,720 --> 00:45:03,730
律政司主管刑事檢控，不受任何干涉。呢樣呢樣嘢係根據終審庭嘅演譯咧，係包括埋律政司有權選擇究竟嗰一個審訊係喺陪審團之下，抑或係法官獨自嘅審訊。呢個絕對係基本法六十七。

206
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:23,740
三條之下嘅一個一個權力同埋權利嚟嘅噉啊。但係更重要嘅就係阿卓大律師話，既然有呢個disimmetry，會唔會就係誒令到有人覺得係控方不公平咧？咁嗱，呢個有一個好嚴重嘅假。

207
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:43,750
假設嗰個假設咧，就係話去選擇有陪審團嘅審訊，或者冇陪審團嘅審訊咧，係有一個好與壞之分嘅。但係啊，我哋現在有冇足夠證據去睇到話有陪審團嘅一定好過冇陪審團，或者一定比較公正啲嘅咧？呢度亦都可以回應啊，黃啊黃議員有一。

208
00:45:43,750 --> 00:46:03,760
有一個嘅誒嘅意見，就住黃議員所講話喺裁判處同埋喺區域法院嗰個誒定罪率係九成咁嗱，其實就住定罪率有幾高，我哋可以睇翻文件，我哋都無需要喺度爭論。但係可值得提、值得誒留意嘅咧，就係一九九一二。

209
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,080
零一三年同埋二零一二年，就住。

210
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:22,120
原仲庭喺被告人不認罪，喺被告人認罪與不認罪所有嘅案件加埋之後，嗰個定罪率咧係超過九成嘅。

211
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:33,460
原眾庭係超過九成嘅，誒，我哋手頭上嘅數據咧，其實亦都係誒公眾文件裏邊睇到，二零一二年咧係去到九十二個percent嘅喺原眾庭。

212
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:54,030
嗯，好啦，就住最後兩點，阿卓大律師講話，誒陪審團制度會令到陪審團有可以參與嗰個審訊嘅機會，係一個社會教育，呢個係同我係同意嘅。但係參與社會教育，我哋從另一個角度睇，係咪必定？

213
00:46:54,030 --> 00:47:14,040
係咪一定需要係從參與一個刑事審訊呢個出發點呢個角度去出發咧？有冇其他方法咧？或者去呢個社會教育係咪一個足夠嘅理據去支持就住呢一個制度嘅改變同埋嘅一個誒根本上？

214
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:28,280
嘅考量咧，最後一點啊，蔡大師所講，我呢度咧，其實我自己嗰個法，我個感覺係好強嘅，就係話誒，哦，法官都係被睇成可能係建制嘅一部分，政府嘅一部分。

215
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:48,630
我哋香港特別誒律師大律師同埋誒律政處，我哋好著緊嘅一樣嘢就係司法獨立。我哋亦都希望期望社會接受司法獨立，亦都咁多年嚟咧喺呢一方面，司法獨立亦都係香港嘅基石。誒，我覺得整體上。

216
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,860
社會。

217
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,880
專業人士係接受。

218
00:47:53,490 --> 00:48:13,500
法官司法獨立呢一個基本嘅概念，而再者，我哋即使你話有懷疑都好，誒唔係淨係得個講字，所有法官喺判有罪冇罪之後咧，係需要畀一個裁決出嚟去解釋翻點解佢咁判。若果佢唔可以自

219
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:33,510
言其説嘅話咧，咁好話佢有其他嘅考量，但係如果佢自圓其説唔到，有其他問題，亦都有上訴庭，亦都有終審庭。咁提話到係法官被睇成係政府建制建制嘅一部分咧，呢一度誒，我希望大家睇翻現在睇。

220
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:43,260
睇翻誒誒司法機關睇翻法官嘅表現咧，我誒希望大律師公會喺呢方面就誒再諗一諗，究竟係咪一個足夠嘅理據？

221
00:48:43,540 --> 00:49:03,550
好咁咧就阿何唔係何？我知道唔係因為何俊仁議員嘅時間，唔係陣間會係陣間我都會跟進。好咁好嘛？建制佢話建制一部分唔代表係政府。佢而家個回應話個話大律師公會話係嗱，我諗大律師公會阿蔡大律師，我陣間最後會畀阿蔡大律師。

222
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:11,810
講下，而家係何俊仁議員嘅時間。黃毓民議員，何俊仁議員繼續係。你有乜嘢想追問？

223
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:29,470
誒主席，嗱我我咁簡單啲講，因為咧誒有啲嘢正清楚啦。第一，我諗我都接受呢個唔係一個基本法或者人權法嘅權利，即係要求一定要有陪審團嗰個審訊。但係高院都唔係啦，因為因為呢個已經係現有嘅制度同埋現有嘅權利。

224
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:49,760
咁第二樣嘢咧，噉啊，專員都同意咗啦。呢個唔係一唔應資源唔係一個最重要嘅考慮。O.K.呢所呢點啊，唔需要再拗啦。咁第三樣嘢咧，就係我相信我哋喺誒即係熟悉英美製度嘅普通法制度出嚟咧，都會幾幾知道陪審員審訊嗰個優點。咁正係大律師公會都講得誒好清楚。

225
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,050
即係嗰個優點嘅地方喺邊度？

226
00:49:52,330 --> 00:50:03,470
咁咧就依個問題咧就係誒，當然你都可以話佢噉，都可能有陣時有啲缺點嘅噉樣。咁譬如話誒，有陣時會唔會係有啲案件係公眾好多討論嘅？

227
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:23,930
討論到咧，根本你都好難揾到有啲陪審團係唔受影響嘅噉樣，即係我我唔知點答嗰啲噉嘅問題。咁咧就，但係總括嚟講，我同意嘅，即係陪審團嘅審訊整體個優點係好清楚嘅。即係如果能夠係用到係呢個地院咧，係應該要值得值得我哋去研究同考。

228
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:30,720
類嘅，不過有一點咧，就係誒，即係譬如，尤其是有一啲案件咧，係純粹係正功嘅。

229
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,000
或者純粹係嗰個被告人，或者係嗰個誒檢控嘅證人，有陣時一個證人點一對一？

230
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,340
佢哋個可信性。

231
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:47,970
咁呢完全係一個正攻，其實呢啲係最適合陪審團去考慮嘅。好多時候有好多非禮案，真係一口對一口。

232
00:50:48,250 --> 00:51:08,260
咁嗰個人係好唔服嘅個被告，即係如果你有一個陪審團咧，起碼即係會覺得喂有啲普通嘅市民嚟到嚟到誒誒睇過噉，佢最後佢作出一個指引之下，翻嚟指引之下作出一個一個裁決咧，我相信嗰個認受性係高好多嘅。即係呢個我睇睇法噉。

233
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,480
咁依家其實咧，除咗高院之外咧，

234
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:31,770
死因庭係有好多時候係有陪審團嘅，尤其是係喺官方拘留之下死亡咧，一定有陪審團。咁大家知道嗰個重要性喺邊度啦。如果你冇陪審團嘅話咧，啲人就會質疑啦。點解有啲人會喺官方拘留之下死亡？佢死因係咩嘢？政府有冇嘢掩住咁？

235
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:48,800
呢個就證明咗陪審團嘅重要，就係誒答曬啦，即係嗰樣嘢咩係建制嗰啲唔好講嗰樣嘢啦，就係你淨係你淨係睇死因定死因裁判官條例裏邊嗰條指定官方機構就係一定要陪審團去到聽個死因言訊。噉我只係想問一樣嘢咧。

236
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:56,080
如果你全面引進，我知道一個好大嘅嘅嘅一個一個誒改變啦，譬如。

237
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:16,380
如果作為一個開始，喺地院裏邊有好多案件，譬如又是人哋爭論緊話：喂，你明明應該高院嘅，你特登拎咗去地院㗎。嗰啲噉嘅案件，或者有好多突即係理由，嗰個被告覺得係好應該係陪審團係較嚟到審係較為公道嘅，起碼係咪有個酌情權作為一個開始先？

238
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:31,410
我我希望全部引進嘅，作為一個一個一個酌情權畀地院嘅法官喺申請之下，以公正嘅原則嚟考慮，呢個係咪可以作為一個改革嘅開始？好，專員酌情權點樣考慮？

239
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,580
誒，多謝主席，多謝誒台議員，誒張晴權。

240
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:56,870
嗯，我哋可唔可以將佢獨立呢一片設置出嚟，就先作一個考慮咧？咁嗱，我唔想話誒，即係推搪話事體重大，一定要逐啲逐啲慢慢考慮。啊，但係喺香港同外國個制度有一點好唔同嘅咧，就係香港實際上係一九五二年。

241
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:06,240
開始係引入咗區域法院呢一個制度，嗱區域法院咧係有佢嘅誒特定性，就係佢個。

242
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,360
刑罰係只係可以判到七年。

243
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:30,820
誒，我哋從呢個角度去考慮咧，若果唔作為一唔就住整體嘅制度作一個全盤嘅考慮嘅話，保留一橛，但係就畀另一橛可以出現嘅話，你要畀被告人去選擇，佢一定會選擇區域法院，因為嗰個。

244
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,950
刑期係七年，相比於喺喺呢個原重庭咧，係。

245
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:56,650
無限嘅，咁呢一個咧係一個好大嘅考慮因素嚟嘅。嗱咁另外，即使喺外國都好，誒頭先幾位誒兩位議員都提到外國，其實外國咧都有好多唔同嘅模式嘅。個模式就係究竟法庭參與度係幾大咧？係咪其中一方，譬如話？

246
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:16,660
控方決定咗係嗰個審判形式係點樣，跟住再去睇下第二方有冇一個申請，跟住最後由法官去決定，或者決定咗之後，再可唔可以有獨立申請？喺咩罪案情況之下係可以申請，咩罪案之下冇？呢啲咧全部。

247
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:36,670
我係有唔同嘅考慮。嗱，作畀一個酌情權咧，呢一個諗法係相對容易去作為一個出發點。但係呢個酌情權係基於啲乜嘢嘅情況之下有呢個酌情權？呢個酌情權可以考慮啲乜嘢？呢個酌情權同控方去考慮。

248
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:56,680
類告唔告告乜嘢，同埋喺邊度告嘅時候，嗰個相互關係係點樣咧？咁嗱，亦都我我強調無意推搪話事情重大，但係所以實際上係一環扣一環，正如頭先蔡律大大律師所講，到最後可能重要嘅就係要做一個全盤嘅考量。

249
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:04,140
誒，再加上譬如話請L.L.C.誒作為一個一啲一啲嘅誒特定嘅。

250
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,580
範疇嘅考慮。

251
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:26,870
嗱，噉我亦都再強調，誒喺公義面前，資源咧係絕對係次要嘅。但係與之同時咧，正如頭先，正如喺我哋嘅文件裏邊指出，資源雖然係次要，但係咧係需要絕對係考慮因素之一，就係呢個資源係咪用一個講句英。

252
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:37,010
係最justify到嗰個改變所帶嚟嘅好處咧。噉我呢個唔係我自己嘅説話，引用翻呢個誒誒。

253
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:59,440
司法機構政務處所講，佢話把將陪審團制度延用於區域法院，將對資源帶來極大和深遠嘅影響。嗱，呢個係佢哋嘅講法，但係當然正如我頭先講喺公義面前咧，公義始終係最重要嘅。好誒，如果可以嘅話，我就。

254
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:19,450
因為頭先咧，其實嗰個撳鍾係撳錯，即係嚇噉。我哋咧就畀下一位嘅議員啦。我喺呢度要宣佈嗰個時間先。咁而家咧就有郭榮亨議員，咁阿梁國雄議員頭先舉咗手同埋我㗎。噉我哋三個咧都係可可以咧最多就係畀到十分鐘，我哋要停啦，就要劃界。

255
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:38,680
就必須畀誒大律師公會，可能佢會有補充啦。頭先阿專員亦都好多時間咧，係講咗佢嘅回應嘅。咁所以咧就係十分鐘係係誒好嚴格嘅遵守，就冇第二輪啦嚇。亦都喺呢一度咧，我哋幾位問完之後就要去下一個議程。咁跟住就係阿郭榮興議員。

256
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,560
多謝主席。嗯。

257
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:52,700
首先咧，我睇到今日嗰個誒座位表咧，楊家雄資深大律師就變咗副刑事檢控專員，而阿譚耀豪資深大律師就變咗刑事。我我做得唔好，被變咗職。

258
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:13,830
我相信，相信啊，希望秘書留意下，因為嚇，嗯，我我有一樣嘢想提出嘅，即係除咗嗰啲法理觀點同埋其他嗰啲司法管轄區嘅做法之外咧，我覺得從香港人嘅角度去睇咧，其實佢哋係非常之擔心啊，究竟而家嗰個檢控程序係唔係公允？而對佢哋嚟講，如果

259
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:33,840
有一個多一個層面，譬如如果有多一個權利係可以揀有呢個陪審員嘅話咧，對佢嚟講係一個保障。即係我哋誒討論呢個問題嘅時候，唔可以太過離地，或者唔可以太過唔理香港嗰個實在嗰個環境係點樣。咁所以其實誒誒喺誒當市民覺得有一啲檢控。

260
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:53,850
決定咧，係佢哋好難去理解，或者覺得係可能係咪有一啲啊政治上嘅考慮嘅時候咧，佢哋會更加想有呢個陪審員嘅制度去保障佢哋嘅權利。咁誒，最近我睇到譬如好佔中有關嘅檢控決定咧，令人擔心嘅就係好多case擺到上庭咧，係。

261
00:57:53,850 --> 00:58:13,860
誒法官會誒有誒批評，或者好多案咧，其實根本上係誒唔夠證據，或者證據非常混亂。咁但係嗰啲又急急噉樣去告，但係咧，譬如好似其他案件噉樣，七警誒搞咗咁耐啦，究竟而家幾時嗰檢控程序去到邊度咧？我哋唔知道。我希望專員可以答一答。

262
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:32,220
誒，譬如好似曾蔭權案噉樣，而家嗰個檢控程序去到邊度咧？我亦都希望啊專員可以誒誒向公眾解釋，因為點解呢個陪審員制度對公眾嚟講係一個好重要嘅嘅問題咧？就係因為佢見到有好多檢控誒嘅誒一啲。

263
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:52,720
決定咧，係佢哋不能夠理解一啲，就好快好快咁告告告。另外嗰啲咧，七警啊、曾蔭權嗰啲嘢，一路拖一路拖。咁所以對佢嚟講，係嗰個制度嘅信心問題啦。啊，主席，我想專員誒就住我最後嗰兩點咧，即係七警同埋曾蔭權案嗰度答一答。好啊，阿專員誒。

264
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,500
多謝主席，多謝郭議員。嗯。

265
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,830
就住一個制度有冇？

266
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:20,560
被告人有冇權去選擇究竟係誒一個法官獨自審訊，亦或係有陪審團審訊咧？誒到最後未必會解答到頭先啊郭議員所提出嘅相關嘅擔心同埋考慮。誒究竟嗰個

267
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:40,570
檢控制檢控機架機檢檢控機制，或者嗰個檢控決定有冇政治考量？當然，我從唔喺唔同嘅範疇裏邊、唔同嘅機情況裏邊、喺唔同嘅機會裏邊，我都講過係絕對冇任何嘅政治考慮。但係我點講同由？

268
00:59:40,570 --> 01:00:00,580
有今日我哋所提呢個議題咧，其實可能冇直接關係，但係亦都借呢個機會誒。既然阿郭議員問到，我哋都可以講就係就住頭先問個兩條相關嗰個案件咧，係亦都之前我哋提過請咗獨立嘅誒外判大律師去考慮緊嘅案。

269
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:08,130
情，我哋亦都而家積極考慮緊。嗯，呢啲事情，個議員誒走唔甩嘅，誒。

270
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:15,780
一定會喺適當嘅時間去考慮清楚之後，會畀大家一個清楚嘅交代。

271
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:22,690
嗯，而啲啊個議員亦都提到話誒有一啲佔中嘅其他案件。

272
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:42,980
嗱，嗰啲案件，我就住話，個係咪證據混亂啊，或者係檢控係咪匆匆啊？呢啲我希望喺今次，因為個議題關係咧，我唔花時間特別回應。但係即使有呢個陪審團嘅制度，我相信嗰類嘅案件咧，喺我哋而家環顧世界。

273
01:00:42,980 --> 01:01:02,990
係咧，都會係一啲係誒，可能係所謂summary offences，誒唔係會跌落去可以或者個被告人去選擇係由法官會同裁會同呢個誒裁判呢個呢個。

274
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:23,000
呢個jury一齊去審嗰類案件，呢類咧都會係一啲簡易自罪嘅程序嚟嘅。咁所以呢一類案件咧，到最後就住今日嘅議題咧，未必一定係會誒有直接嘅觀點。係嚇咁即係話，噉啊，郭榮亨議員，即係我想搞清楚就係，即係曾蔭權案，你仍然都係攞緊。

275
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:43,010
誒外國誒誒獨立大大律師嘅意見，而出警亦都係同樣。因為我我點解咁講咧？就係當然，我哋作為律師，我哋知道誒陪審團制度同埋法官制度咧，係同嗰個檢控決定係未必有直接關係。但係從市民個角度或者觀感、公眾觀感嘅角度咧，佢就覺得哇！

276
01:01:43,010 --> 01:02:03,020
你有啲案咧就係咁告告告，另外一啲咧你又拖住好似唔做噉樣，我都唔知嗰嗰個檢控決定係咪一定即係公平、公正、公允嘅一個決定。噉我情願多一個我係即係我覺得係能夠保障到我權利嘅制度，就係陪陪審團制度。所以我頭先講話，我哋討論呢樣嘢嘅時候唔可以太過離地，一定要照顧。

277
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:21,430
到香港人誒一般嘅感受噉就住嗰兩單案件，我我理解嗰個嗰個進度係咪係咪噉樣咧？我我諗就咁阿專員答之前咧，我哋要集中翻咧，要同陪審團制度相關嘅嗰個部分。呢個完全有關係。我想答嘅，我頭先答咗啦。好。

278
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:31,530
誒，郭議員仲有冇追問？有，我就想問嗰兩間案件，我理解嘅進度啱唔啱？誒，嗰個你睇下專員，後先佢已經講佢答咗，仲有冇補充啊？

279
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:48,840
就住同陪審團制度相關嘅，就住陪審團相關有冇補？唔係啊，我個問題佢未答啊。你嘅問題都要同陪審團制度相關嘅。我咪頭先解釋咗個關係喺邊咯，你畀佢答。我我頭先問咗佢㗎啦，嚇，仲有冇補充啊？

280
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:57,710
正如頭先我解釋，誒，你話究竟頭先阿國議員問得好有技巧，係咪仲係攞緊？

281
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:04,140
外判資深大律師或者外判律師嘅意見，嗱我知係會講話，我哋係誒。

282
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:18,570
徵求外判大律師嘅意見，到整體上案件嘅不同考慮咧，我哋我哋仲要係全盤考慮嘅。嗯，好，咁跟住係下一位議員係梁國雄議員。

283
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,370
即係主席，其實成件事就唔係好。

284
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:27,070
好複雜嘅係咪？即係誒講陪審員嘅制度，當然誒。

285
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:35,600
我明白，如果你有培訓咧，就如果你喺誒區域法院都有嘅時候咧，當然係會有資源嘅問題啦。噉啊，專員就講咗。

286
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:42,970
好多次就係話咧，公義係先個資源。咁不過咧，資源咧都係一個好重要考慮嘅因素。

287
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:51,590
咁即是係咩咧？我就覺得你講咗畀我聽咧，就係話，如果社會或者誒司法界，

288
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,800
或者係立法會。

289
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:08,680
都覺得係應該使嗰啲資源就使啦，係咪？係咁簡單啫。嗱，咁有咩資源咧？咁當然可能你就係話哦，嗰啲陪審員冇乜人想做，咁所以咧唔夠陪審員，我唔知係咪咁講啊。

290
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:12,970
係咪？如果係噉嘅時候，當然係一個問題啦。咁但係呢個，

291
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:21,300
陪審員唔夠係一個地方嘅文明嘅表示嚟㗎嘛，即係你有啲人關唔關心法治啫嘛，抽到你，你開唔開？

292
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,300
係嘛？咁所以呢個就係要你哋去培養咯。

293
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:35,340
呢個就係問題啦！嗱，咁但係個問題咧就在於咩咧？你正話講嘅講即係講法咧，其實係達唔到呢個效果咯。你個意思就係哦。

294
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:43,580
我哋其實喺好多嘅誒司法管轄區咧，唔係每一即係唔係所有嘅案件都可以用陪審團嘅。

295
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,850
係要睇嗰啲案件嘅性質。

296
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:51,620
或者係睇嗰度嘅傳統，或者規定，呢個係明白嘅。

297
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,380
而家咧就係。

298
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,030
我哋嘅講法就係咩？就係話。

299
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:57,560
啊。

300
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:10,660
到底一個被告嘅誒被告啦，即係被告嗰一方咧，有冇權去選擇佢單案畀陪審誒畀陪審團審啊嘛？咁當然係冇啦。

301
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:31,000
因為你告嗰個罪喺呢個區域法院嘅時候，噉佢點樣揾陪審團咧？唔可以唔可以高院叫嗰班嚟？佢噉樣唔可以用陪審團，所以我哋先至有一個叫你哋改革，就係話當有啲罪行係誒最多判七年，而喺一噉，所以佢喺區域法院審嘅時候呢個陪審。

302
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,320
審前嘅制度應唔應該喺區域法院做一改革，畀佢畀嗰啲法官有酌情權啊嘛？呢個就係關鍵啦。

303
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,080
我覺得呢個係關鍵嚟嘅，我認為應該做呢個改革。

304
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,690
我我我好清楚，話畀你聽。

305
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,910
個原因就係咩咧？其實法治。

306
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,190
不單只要秉承，而必須彰顯。

307
01:05:52,510 --> 01:06:04,610
呢一個嘅講法係咩咧？就係唔單止喺程序上你畀人睇都係噉，而係嗰啲市民相信我哋嘅發展應該改革嘅時候，嗰個司法當局。

308
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:07,380
有冇能力去回應呢個社會嘅質疑？

309
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,100
呢個就係關鍵。

310
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,840
如果我哋香港今日覺得，

311
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:22,070
喺區域法院裏邊，可唔可以試行呢一個誒陪審團嘅誒陪審員嘅制度？或者有啲人覺得？

312
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:30,860
我寧願你呢個係高院審啦，因為我覺得我單嘢咧誒喺高院可能有陪審員好啲嘅誒好好黐嘅陪審團。

313
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:40,340
咁點處理咧？咁當然唔得啦！在在你個角度嚟講，你唔可以夾硬將將一個某一個人可可被判嘅刑期整多幾年畀佢㗎嘛？係咪？你講咗啦呢個。

314
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,800
所以喺呢點上邊，我覺得如果你向下移係好啲咯。

315
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:53,280
噉你咪解決咗呢個問題咯？你解決即係解決咗呢個問題。嗱，點解噉樣講啊？我你你唔好誤會我哋誒話呢個誒。

316
01:06:53,560 --> 01:07:02,610
誒，正話我啲民議員講，即係話誒，你講建制啦，建制當然唔係政府啦，建制唔等於政府啦，係政府可能係建制嘅一部分啦。

317
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,850
嗱，我哋對於啊～

318
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:14,030
我哋有興趣嘅就係對於被告權利嘅保護，你明唔明啊？我冇需要懷疑你啊！咁要一個好嘅制度。

319
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:20,900
嘅話，點解我哋唔實行咧？呢個你一定要，一定，即係我覺得係誒司法當局或者係誒。

320
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:41,210
呢個誒檢控當局都要去回答嘅問題嚟嘅嗱，你檢控你檢控專員或者檢控當局，你唔會反對你，你冇一個意見就係話刑期喺七年以內嘅三年以上，即係喺區域法院審嘅案件，用陪審員嘅陪審團嘅制度。

321
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:44,800
係對法治嘅彰顯有破壞㗎嘛，冇㗎嘛。

322
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,550
係個問題，就係做幾多啫嘛？咩案件啫嘛？

323
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:54,410
我覺得呢個改革喺香港應該實行咯。如果做得做咗之後，

324
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,660
唔好嘅咪改咯。

325
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,790
或者你真係去到嗰度唔夠陪審團？

326
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:07,400
因為香港人太自私啊，唔死都唔肯去做，咁即係當然係個制度被破壞呢個。但係呢個同你冇同你冇關㗎嘛。

327
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:15,480
係嘛？如果真係冇嘅，你咪拖件案都冇計嘅。即係其實，我都係楊楊生，你要明白一樣嘢。當你講得話。

328
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,790
公義永遠係先於資源嘅時候咧。

329
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:29,660
就係咁㗎啦。當然喺中間有好多矛盾，我哋知道美國都係啊。咁如果你揾個jur jury，咁如果單案好矚目嘅，可能揀一年都揀唔到添。

330
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:36,390
咁都係要咁做㗎，所以我自己誒極之極之極之極之極之贊成。

331
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:56,680
係誒喺呢一個誒誒區域法院咧，可以做一個誒誒改革。而第二個就係話，我最想斟酌一個問題就係話，當一個誒被告佢建議佢自己去誒接受呢個誒誒誒呢個陪審團嘅。

332
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:02,810
審訊嘅時候，你喺設施上面冇呢樣嘢嘅時候，你即係剝奪咗個權利㗎嘛？你明我講乜嘢啊？

333
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:10,080
譬如講，我係畀你，因為檢控嗰方面係唔可以揀告一條罪係。

334
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:17,950
係拎即係明明佢係喺地院要審嘅，要拎去高院審，呢個唔得啦。咁所以唯一嘅唯一嘅出路就係話。

335
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,260
改革咯！

336
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:24,920
如果你贊成呢個原則嘅，我我希我希望，即係你你哋諗一諗啦。

337
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:30,250
嗯，專員係多謝多謝誒主席，多謝誒誒議員。

338
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,390
嗯，幾點回應？第一。

339
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:44,310
係咪冇噉嘅機制就剝削咗被告嘅權利咧？咁誒呢一點我亦都唔想話太過抽象或者抽空，但係實際上喺

340
01:09:44,590 --> 01:10:00,640
一般普通法裏邊有冇呢個權利？可能好多案例喺外國嘅案例係話有，但係喺香港嘅範疇，實際上係因為一九五二年嘅法例咧，令到呢個判呢個權利咧喺香港已經唔再係實行啦。

341
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,850
噉。

342
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:22,160
都而噉，所以就一步一步咧，就係上訴庭、中審庭喺唔同嘅判例裏邊咧，都講都提翻呢一個喺香港特定嘅法制制度裏邊嗰個權利嗰個考慮係乜嘢？咁所以睇翻香港個制度係咪話冇咗呢個機制就令到被個人？

343
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:33,910
冇咗一個可能有一啲喺外國人會喺外國有權利，而香港人冇咗咧，咁呢個誒，我需要考慮翻香港整個制度嗰個歷史。

344
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,740
啊！第二樣嘢就係。

345
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:56,030
頭先黃啊啊啊梁議員講得有好多嘅各方面咧，我係理解嘅。特別話係喺區域法院，好冇引入首先引入陪審團制度啊，作為一個起步。其實亦都可以睇翻成件事，今次呢個議程嗰個演進嘅呢個議程有一九九七。

346
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:16,040
七年我睇翻啲文件，已經開始就係話提好冇喺區域法院或者地方法院，當時嘅地方法院引入陪審團制度。咁講咗一段日子之後咧，似乎就不得要領。噉啊，去到一段日子之後，噉啊誒政府當時講話誒冇一個現存嘅誒諗法會去將佢引入。咁咁呢個呢個。

347
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:36,050
議題咧就變咗話係咪應該就住控方去考慮咩案件拎上去上誒誒懲眾庭有有裁判有呢個jury去審咩嘅案件留翻喺區域法院審，就住呢一個方面咧作一個再上比較詳盡嘅考慮。咁所以咧就住呢方面。

348
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:56,060
係啦，噉啊，因為有呢個議題咧，噉我哋亦都去誒討論過，喺就住嗰個檢控守則裏邊咧，亦都有第作為第一步嘅改變，誒講清楚就住去選擇去法院嘅時候，應該要要考慮啲咩因素，亦都寫咗出嚟作為第一步嘅改變。咁但係而家去到今日咧，又翻返轉頭又講。

349
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:16,070
講翻咧，就係話係咪應該喺區域法院引進嗱？呢啲咧，我理解呢一個係一個重大議題，所以誒，我哋從喺唔同嘅時間裏邊咧去考慮呢一個議議題，喺唔同角度咧係係適合嘅。但係喺唔同嘅角度裏邊咧，亦都頭先啊梁議員所講，我好快對盤應埋呢一句，就係係咪話誒，淨係。

350
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:36,080
唔夠陪審團，唔夠陪審員，或者陪審員佢哋唔肯做噉。其實，如果我哋睇翻司法機構，佢哋做翻份文件咧，誒引入陪審團制度，除咗人數之外咧，就各方面嘅考慮因素，特別咧，可能係咪誒需要有一間一間獨立嘅政府大樓，誒三千六百尺定三萬六千尺嘅嘅大樓？

351
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:44,240
啊，咁呢一方面咧，係都誒呢個唔係我自己講，但係係一啲現實嘅考慮。誒，哦，主席。

352
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:52,600
我聽嚟聽去咧，就係佢解釋唔到一樣嘢，就係話，如果資源係一個其中要考慮嘅因素，而我哋個社會覺得。

353
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:05,980
誒喺呢個誒區域法院去實行，即係誒試行呢一個陪審團嘅制度，係嗰個意見咁強烈嘅話，佢冇可能話因為使多啲錢唔做㗎喎。

354
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,420
我以為人我就冇得咬啊！

355
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:17,060
如果我覺得呢個真係唔合唔係好合乎比例嘅解釋咯，你要明白拎到去法庭審嘅人係好慘㗎嘛。

356
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,490
佢嗰個權係絕對嘅喎，即係佢。

357
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:27,450
即係個問題，佢要明啊！如果你喺區域法院嗰度冇賠償條制度嘅話咧，逢喺區域法院。

358
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:47,800
審嘅人咧，佢只有奇諸於咧，就走咗去上訴庭。好啦，梁國雄議員，上訴庭我哋會繼續，我有我都會誒，我等你有一個時間嚇。你嘅意見應該聽得好清楚。咁咧跟住即係誒，因為今日我哋嘅時間嘅問題，最後一位咧就係我自己嘅本人。噉就誒，我頭先已經係劃咗線㗎。嗱，首

359
01:13:47,800 --> 01:14:07,810
先咧，我想講咧誒，頭先都有提到基本法嘅問題係咪？八十六條佢話原有實行嘅陪審制度咧嘅原則予以保留，因此我認為咧誒陪審團制度改與唔改，其實都係喺基本法裏邊嗰個空間容許嘅。唔改亦都即係政府亦都冇違反基本法。

360
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:16,400
改，我覺得亦都係符合基本法，咁所以因此呢個所謂討論陪審團制度，我哋嗰個空間其實係相當大嘅。

361
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:36,690
咁咧，我諗喺誒陪審團制度咧，喺我哋舊年其實都有好充分嘅討論，甚至咧係的確係我哋本委員會要求誒政府啦、律政署係提供咧，究竟如果我哋係改善陪審團制度嘅時候，可能牽涉到佢哋要增撥嘅資源啦，同埋各方面嘅利弊嘅問題。

362
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:56,700
甚至我哋都討論過咧，喺外國可能佢又甚至有啲叫做電子陪審團啦，有好多咧。而家進行係好多嘅研究喺日本啦，喺外國咧，其實都誒紛紛咧就係研究究竟陪審團對嗰個地方嗰個嘅司法公義咧嗰個誒利弊究竟係點噉。

363
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:14,600
我自己本人咧，亦都對於陪審團制度其實好有興趣嘅嚇，咁亦都係誒睇過一啲誒特別係比較研究關於陪審團制度。噉我都係同意咧，就住陪審團制度嗰個討論咧誒，我諗資源唔係一個我哋重要嘅考慮。

364
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:24,020
如果改善咗呢個制度係能夠喺司法公義嗰個彰顯係好啲嘅時候，我認為咧資源係一個次要嘅考慮。

365
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:31,020
誒重要嘅考慮咧，反為即係我都希望今日其實之前好幾位議員表達咗，其實陪審。

366
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:51,450
團制度，大家好清楚。頭先大律師公會嘅代表都講，法官咧佢就決定係法律嘅問題，陪審團係決定一個事實嘅問題。喺呢一個問題上咧，其實喺歷史裏邊咁多重大嘅案件咧，特別係容許陪審團制度，包括喺外國美國都出現過咧，喺陪審。

367
01:15:51,450 --> 01:16:04,830
團制度裏面咧，誒佢亦都有佢嘅缺點，個缺點就係誒，亦都係產生過一啲可能係同司法公義係唔符合嘅情況，有好多好出名嘅個案。

368
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:15,900
但係陪審團嘅制度咧，要睇到咧，當嗰個當事人好想用、好想用嘅時候，佢當然自己要考慮幾個問題嘅。第一，如果佢要選擇陪審團，

369
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:34,120
嗰個誒嗰個資源，佢嘅支出，佢嘅時間，佢自己本人嚇支出時間。法庭亦都需要更長嘅時間。當然政府亦都要付出好長嘅時間。我覺得我哋係好重要要考慮，我哋畀唔畀誒嗰個當事人？

370
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:54,430
佢係可以有呢個機會去提出佢希望用陪審團喺佢個案，但係我都同意咧。呢個誒，尤其是喺地方法院咧。如果你話必然嘅權利有好大嘅機會咧，佢亦都有機會被濫用嘅，因為你有資源多或者其他方面咧，佢成日乜嘢都用陪審。

371
01:16:54,430 --> 01:17:14,440
陪審團，而喺陪審團嘅質素咧，我覺得嗱，我哋我係好好客觀嘅、中立嘅呢個問題。即係我覺得我哋要確保嘅事實上，的確亦都有出現過陪審團嗰個質素嘅問題，而影響咗誒，亦都有過往有好有容屍案，有好多其他咧，大家係認為咧係變咗咧，唔係好公義。

372
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:34,570
覺得佢個質素係唔夠法官啊！呢啲情況咧，亦都有出現過。我哋點樣平衡咧？點樣平衡呢一個公眾嘅需要同埋咧改革嘅需要？噉我自己咧就傾向咧係提出咧，就係考慮下會唔會喺改革嘅方向上邊係可以畀法。

373
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:54,580
官有呢個酌情權，即係比較具體。嗱，如果佢係乜嘢都提嘅，而根本個個案本身係唔適合再噉樣去用陪審團制度，噉我覺得法官會唔會亦都係可以有一個即係誒發言權、有一個酌情權喺呢度咧？噉，噉我會畀專員你誒回應我呢個問題嘅。嗱，我係第。

374
01:17:54,580 --> 01:18:14,590
二委委員提出呢一個酌情權嘅問題。咁咧，此外我都想畀大律師公會代表就喺我呢個時間畀你回應啦。頭先你提到啦，我諗係話誒嗰個啊法官可能係建制嘅一部分。如果我嘅理解，其實你係指咧係制度嘅一部分啫，就並唔係政府嘅一部分。

375
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:34,600
亦都當然唔係建制派嘅一部分，絕對咧。其實你講嗰個上文下理都係好清楚，係講一個制度嗰一部分，即係其實法官嗰個司法獨立咧，應該係好清楚嘅。噉我諗咧就誒，我自己都得出一個噉嘅誒解釋。噉我就相信我會想時間畀專員。

376
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,430
同埋阿阿蔡大律師可以係回答一下呢個問題嚇。

377
01:18:41,210 --> 01:19:01,220
誒，因為我我哋真係咧，頭先係嗰界鐘一次過，唔係五分加落去嘅。因為你個做法咧，完全咧，我覺得完全唔恰當。即係我我希望你你畀啲時間我有咁做嘢嘅題目咧，我要講嘢。誒，謝偉俊議員嗱，首先咧，你要誒尊重咧，我哋頭先一開始係問咗當時咧只有兩個議員係在席。

378
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:17,860
咁如果你係好想發言，那謝偉俊議員，你畀我講完先。如果你好想發言，你其實應該咧，我哋其實提到你嘅建議，甚至你想加落下一個月嘅建議，我哋都討論過。你係應該咧，係早啲出席。嗱喺呢個問題上咧，我哋你。

379
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:38,150
誒，謝偉俊議員，你聽住先嗱。噉樣咧，我哋咧最多嗱，頭先咧，我哋係講咗咧，因為係好少嘅議員佢係啊舉手，噉我哋就容許一個空間。如果你係好想發言咧，我最多可以畀你三分鐘補充呢個問題，好冇？咁然之後就係最後啦，我就唔可以咧。

380
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:58,160
好似第一輪，佢哋準時，大家一齊嚟。最後其實咧，我喺劃界之前，我亦都係等睇下會唔會多啲議員。噉你嗰陣時都係未出現嗱，所有委員會喺時間嘅方面咧，我哋必須要控制。我哋呢個議程最多係去到六點鐘。咁如果你要真係要唔講唔得咧，我畀你。

381
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,560
三分鐘時間，咁請你而家開始。主席。

382
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:15,670
我哋都希望咧，將來就算真係冇議員嘅舉手嘅話咧，可以入先行五分鐘先至再加上去，好過一次過十分鐘咧，然之後冇得彎轉。呢個係純粹意見嘅。誒，今日嘅討論嗱，呢個係我嘅決定，好唔好啊？噉你而家即刻三分鐘發言，跟住畀雙方發言，好嘛？

383
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:25,110
係，謝偉俊議員，三分鐘。我哋啱啱咧就慶祝咗大憲章八百週年紀念。

384
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:30,340
大憲章裏面第三十九條咧講得好清楚，八百年前大家都知道咧。

385
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,830
所謂叫做。

386
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:33,270
遊翻。

387
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:43,610
被告嘅同輩trouble peers，當時佢哋用法咧就唔係用peer呢個字咧，佢哋叫做係lawful judgement of his equals。

388
01:20:43,890 --> 01:21:03,900
意思都係類似我哋而家理解就係trial by peers呢個概念，所以嗰個概念咧審訊咧原先嘅出發點咧必須係咧用翻呢個咁重要嘅原則嘅。我哋香港咧點解會改造喺地方法院咧有呢個改變咧？純粹就係experienced係將方。

389
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:23,910
方便，因為當其時所有法庭都係英文審訊。當其時，如果你話係用一個陪審團嘅話咧，係要求英文水準好高嘅，無論係法官、大律師、陪審員都要係，就算唔係外籍英國人咧，都可能要識英文嘅高級華人先有資格審嘅。而當時我哋冇。

390
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:43,920
冇足夠人才咧處理呢個問題，所以我哋去翻回原歸正本嘅時候咧，就知道究竟嗰個出發點係點樣。所以呢一方面咧，我係絕對咧反對政府咧喺呢一方面喺無論喺資源上、其他考量上咧，就唔再進行呢個改革嘅，因為大家都知道咧，我相信在座。

391
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,310
個誒楊專員又好，我哋在座嘅一啲嘅大律師同事。

392
01:21:48,590 --> 01:22:08,600
都清楚知道，任何審得案多嘅人，包括我自己咧，都清楚明白到咧喺法庭上陪審團嘅判決同埋法官嘅判決喺審事實上方面嘅一個差距喺邊度。咁所以咧，我哋如果能夠可以喺經濟上承擔得起，喺我哋香港九七之後法庭越嚟

393
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:28,610
愈多中文審訊，甚或我哋嘅法律人才咧，都充斥住好多而家係兩民都非常之熟悉嘅人士嘅時候咧，再用呢個藉口咧，就係話我哋唔需要改革，因為我哋要翻翻八百年前嘅基本，就係希望最起碼咧，我哋喺人權上咧審訊係有一個由我哋明白一般社會社情。

394
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:48,820
亦都唔係好似有。剛才我啊大律師公會嘅同事介紹過咧，就係話有啲法官審得案多咧，特別某啲罪行對一啲罪，譬如話販毒分子啊，佢哋基本上都有個偏見咧，認為咗係唔使點審㗎啦，一定係㗎啦。呢種噉嘅一個所謂prejudice啦，一種咁偏向咧，其實係對於審審訊嗰個。

395
01:22:48,820 --> 01:23:08,830
事實嚟講咧，係非常之不利嘅。噉就算真係話，我哋而家喺行喺個資源上唔足夠，馬上進行嘅話咧，都起碼應該盡快考慮咧喺選擇上容許被告咧有個選擇。呢個並非係改變咗我哋嘅法律。其實我哋翻翻歸本，即係去翻最原先嗰個程序，就係話我哋應該畀佢有機會。

396
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:19,940
Trial by peers咁簡單，我希望咧就呢一方面咧就當局係要盡快執行。只係我對唔住我支持，我因為我覺得呢個好重要原則，我唔講。我哋畀楊專員，楊專員好。

397
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,250
嗯。

398
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,560
講就係。

399
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:28,350
始終，正如終審庭所講，根據基本法第六十三條裏邊誒。

400
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:48,860
嗰個控方嘅權力咧，係絕對係涵蓋咗去選擇，誒究竟係喺嚴重庭審啦，亦或係喺區域法院審呢一個選擇權嘅。噉就住呢一方面，已經香港沿用咗超過六七十年嘅一套法制，要改變嘅話咧，我唔我強調我。

401
01:23:48,860 --> 01:24:04,330
我哋唔係固步自封，亦都冇既定嘅偏向，但係一個行咗六六七十年嘅一套改嘅制度要改變咧，我哋呢喺呢一方面咧，我係誒同意大律師公會所講，係需要。

402
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:24,620
慎重、詳細考慮。其實呢個詳細考慮咧，係包括於主席頭先，無論係主席閣下同埋，你有另外一兩位議員所提出話，就住係一啲個別一啲，譬如話喺區域法院裏邊有冇一個畀法官一個酌情權去決定。啊，我希望我唔係。

403
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:44,630
重複自己，但係就住酌情權，我哋都要整體考慮，就係喺邊種情況之下、邊種罪行之下，同埋喺誒咩情況之下個次罪、情罪係點樣去做一個酌情？若果一個有呢個酌情權，若果我哋見到好多。

404
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:50,940
法例係講到話，如果要誒做一個酌情權嘅時候咧，有啲咩考，有啲咩因素要考量？

405
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:57,370
嗱，如果呢個酌情權係會令到好多嘅有陪審團。

406
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:17,660
一齊審嘅案件出現嘅話咧，啊，我係要需要尊重誒司法機構佢哋嘅睇法。佢哋嘅睇法就係喺呢一方面係會牽涉一個影響深遠嘅各方面嘅影響。呢個誒，佢哋係最好嘅一個自憤者去考慮。

407
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,850
誒，咁所以呢一個。

408
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,190
discretion.

409
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:40,230
究竟係點做？會帶出幾多有陪審團制度之下審訊嘅案件？現在司法機構同埋現在司法機構資源，包括法官嗱，用我一個鬥膽講一句，誒，即使現在。

410
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:48,770
唔係話特別多嘅律師或者法官就住陪審團引導陪審團呢方面咧。

411
01:25:49,100 --> 01:26:09,110
用喺我強調，再鬥膽講一句，有足夠經驗喺呢一方面咧，係需要培訓。誒，亦都唔係話純粹講講人，唔係講錢，係講人嘅資源方面。好。咁所以我都係強調一句，希望誒誒主席誒，當若果你係考慮話。

412
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:27,550
話畀一個建議嘅話咧，嗯，呢個建議都可能係，正如頭先大律師公會嘅代表講，嗯，去考慮喺唔同嘅持份者或者LLC作一個比較就住呢一個誒description嘅一個特定嘅考慮，冇錯呢個酌情權嘅考慮。

413
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:47,890
律師係簡單回應就，我哋要完結今次嘅討論。係。嗯，Yes，Chairlady，members of the panel. First of all, I think I need to address the unfortunate use of the word establishment employed by me earlier. On, of course, what I mean is, of course, the judiciary is.

414
01:26:47,890 --> 01:27:04,460
is is independent. We have neither I nor Deba have any doubt as to that. But I think the important thing is the public perception as to who was sending someone to jail for a significant amount of time, between two to seven years.

415
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:05,650
嗯。

416
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:08,500
what happens is that

417
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:28,790
It may be seen by those, the public and the defendant, that the person is being sent to jail by someone occupying a position in the at the pinnacle of society vis-à-vis in the social, educational, economic strata of of our society. So.

418
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:47,280
That is a way of looking at a single judge deciding on everything, and the positive thing of having a jury is that at least to a certain extent, that perception would be ameliorated.

419
01:27:47,560 --> 01:28:05,150
Now as to the question of discretion, it it is it is it is a formula that is worth looking into, because for example in civil libel trial, a libel trial or a defamation trial could

420
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:25,440
有個陪審團，或可，被被被被試，無陪審團，所以那會取決於兩方的提交，是否他們想要陪審團，然後會被決定為程序上的決定。好，多謝啊，好。

421
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,810
I'm quite happy to hear from.

422
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:49,100
from members of the panel that some of them are in support of the expansion of jury trial, but of course, as the director correctly points out, after the decision in Lily Chang and other cases, the only possibility that it could be expanded is through legislation, and that's why I would hope that.

423
01:28:49,100 --> 01:29:09,110
your panel and other members of this council would give this serious thought。好多謝阿蔡大律師，大家也去知道呢個題目，我哋已經作出充分嘅討論，亦都我知道相關嘅同事亦都誒得到阿專員嘅回應。但係我哋委員會會繼續跟進，亦都希望話頭先係提到會唔會某啲嘅罪行，大家可以咧。

424
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:17,120
繼續研究㗎，噉我多謝大家今日出席。而家咧，我哋就要進入第二個議程啦。咁大家可以，你哋可以先行離去。

425
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:30,870
噉就誒第二個議程咧，其實就係誒，亦都係已經係喺嗰個誒議事堂咧，就係誒派咗畀大家嘅，就係《二二道歉條例》。

426
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:51,730
嘅公眾諮詢係我哋呢個委員會，亦都傾咗一段時間嘅。咁咧相關嘅文件咧係立法會C B括弧四一一六八足十四hyphen十五括弧零四，就係政府當局有關制定道歉法例嘅公眾諮詢嘅文件。

427
01:29:53,020 --> 01:30:13,030
請先邀請咧處理民事法律專員張錦慧女士就誒進入會議廳，同埋我哋亦都啊，因為我哋都希望邀請多幾位委員係啊喺議事廳嘅，咁所以咧誒而家咧我哋係誒先邀請其他嘅委員。

428
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:18,880
噉我哋跟住咧就請阿張專員咧係啊進入議事廳，係介紹。

429
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:22,920
道歉法例嘅情況嘅。

430
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,700
有啲咩？

431
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,780
個個又憎。

432
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:49,790
我決定咗。

433
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,980
我畀佢哋講啦，好嘛？

434
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,320
因為你時間。

435
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:17,170
哇！

436
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,360
就誒。

437
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:39,650
首先咧，我哋因為都係誒時間嘅關係啦，我哋首先咧就請誒處理民事法律專員張錦慧女士就住政府研究制定道歉法例嘅背景、目的同埋其他司法管轄區嘅道歉法例咧嘅發。

438
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:59,660
展情況作一簡介嘅，然後我哋先至邀請咧調解督導委員會成員王國英啊資深大律師係就住道歉法例嘅內容同埋建議咧，就係誒再作出簡介，再請大律師公會嘅代表發言嘅噉。

439
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:19,670
噉我哋首先咧就請阿張專員係作出介紹。多謝主席。主席誒，以律政司為主席嘅調解督導委員會咧誒，喺今日剛剛係發表咗係在香港製定道歉法例諮詢文件誒，並展開咗為期六個星期嘅高。

440
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:20,980
公眾諮詢嘅。

441
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:41,270
希望藉此係收集到公眾同埋持份者對於應否喺香港特區制定道歉法律呢方面嘅意見。而律政司亦都今日係出咗一個新聞稿，係簡介呢個公眾諮詢嘅內容。誒，律政司亦都係誒喺今日安排誒送遞咗一啲諮詢文件畀立法會嘅秘書。

442
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:53,370
處，我相信議員應該係喺今日會收到呢個文件同埋諮詢文件嘅摘要，而諮詢文件同埋諮詢文件嘅摘要咧，亦都係上載咗喺律政司誒嘅網頁嗰度。

443
01:32:53,750 --> 01:33:13,760
有關於誒道歉法例嘅背景誒簡介咧，其實律政司係調解工作小組喺二零一零年誒時候就發表咗一個報告。報告裏邊係提出咗多項嘅建議，建議其中嘅一項咧就係就應否喺香港製定道歉法例呢一個議題。

444
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:20,130
認為係值得誒畀一個適當嘅組織咧，係作出一個全面嘅檢討。

445
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:40,710
而律政司司長喺二零一二年年底成立咗調解督導委員會，呢一位呢個誒督導委員會咧係有跨界別嘅成員，係包括咗法律專業嘅人士、調解專家、醫生、學者、誒行政官、行政管理嘅人員。

446
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,760
社工同埋保險業嘅人士。

447
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:55,320
喺調解督導委員會核下嘅規管架構小組委員會咧，就係負責考慮研究香港製定道歉條例嘅議題嘅。

448
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:15,910
調誒調解督導委員會係檢視咗規管架構小組委員會誒所作出嘅報告之後，就決定係作出咗我哋誒上述講嘅六星期嘅公眾諮詢。誒而坐喺坐喺誒最左邊嗰位啊英誒黃國英資深大律師咧，就係規管。

449
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:20,980
架構小組委員會嘅主席，亦都係調解督導委員會嘅成員。

450
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:30,460
誒，稍後黃國英資深大律師咧就會簡介誒誒諮詢文件裏邊最主要嗰七項嘅建議嘅。

451
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:47,420
有關於調解法例嘅目的，誒最主要調解法例係提倡同埋鼓勵道歉，以促進各方面嘅爭議咧，可以有效同埋友善地去作出和解嘅。

452
01:34:47,700 --> 01:35:00,710
好多時候喺一啲誒不幸嘅事故發生咗之後，誒造成傷害嘅一方可能有心有意向誒受害嗰一方表達慰問、同情或者歉意。

453
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:06,170
誒，但係造成傷害嗰一方咧，就往往擔心道歉。

454
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:26,570
誒道歉咗之後咧，會唔會構成咗法律責任？或者如果係有保險誒合約嘅嘅問題咧，會唔會保險單裏邊咧係受制咗佢哋向誒誒受傷嗰一方咧係作出道歉或者承認過失？呢啲理由咧？

455
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:33,100
好多時候係構成咗點解一般誒對於道歉咧係有誒擔心嘅。

456
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:42,170
雖然裁定一個人係唔係喺法律上係負上責任，誒呢一個問題咧，係法院嘅職能。

457
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:59,950
而而單靠道歉咧，亦都唔可能咧，係裁定一個人嘅法律責任嘅。雖然係噉樣樣咧，一般人咧係有一個擔心，如果道歉會唔會自動構成咗一個承認過失或者承認法律責任嘅問題？

458
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:06,150
或者呢啲係會唔會作為一啲呈堂證供咧？所以呢啲係有呢啲噉嘅憂慮嘅。

459
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:18,440
咁為咗消除呢啲憂慮咧，如果香港係制定道歉法例嘅話咧，就必須就住所謂道歉一詞咧，係定明咗一個誒。

460
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:24,520
明確嘅法律意義，同埋亦都要澄清道歉嘅法律後果。

461
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:27,120
喺呢方面咧，誒。

462
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:33,910
誒嗰個誒誒督導委員會咧，其實亦都係誒藉著誒。

463
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:46,460
為為關注即係誒其他司法管轄區嘅發展情況咧，係作出咗研究嘅。咁誒，其實道歉法例咧就唔係一個好嶄新嘅概念嚟。

464
01:36:46,740 --> 01:37:01,160
喺大部分嘅司法管轄區都係一個十分普遍嘅誒制定嘅嘅法例。呢個包括係喺美國啦、加拿大、澳洲同埋英國都係有誒制定相類同嘅法例嘅。

465
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:21,450
而喺誒今次嘅研究過程中咧，調解督導委員會咧係參考咗外國嘅經驗，檢視咗總共有五十六個普通法司法管轄區嘅道歉法例，其中係包括一個最新係二零一五年今年三月蘇格蘭嘅誒道歉法令草案嘅。

466
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:21,790
係。

467
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:35,230
總括嚟睇到咧，清晰可見道歉法例咧係非常之普遍，而且個大趨勢就係睇到道歉法例，無論係佢嘅涵蓋面啦，同埋應用嘅範圍咧，都係日趨廣泛嘅。

468
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:43,960
到到目前為止，加拿大嘅法例佢嘅涵蓋面同埋應用嘅誒範圍咧，係最廣嘅。

469
01:37:44,240 --> 01:38:04,250
採用誒嘅係全面嘅道歉，而唔係有限嘅道歉。全面嘅道歉意思即係話係包含咗承認過失嘅一部分嘅。而正話所提到蘇格蘭嗰個誒法令草案咧，亦都似乎係有誒進一步擴展道歉誒嗰個意意義嗰。

470
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:08,380
嗰個範圍係包括埋誒事實嘅陳述嘅。

471
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:25,140
此外咧，喺呢啲道歉法例，大部分咧亦都係進一步咧係明文咁涵蓋咗啊訴訟時效，同埋正話提及提及到保險誒保險單或者保險合約條款嘅問題嘅。

472
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:31,220
諮詢文件咧係好詳細咁研究咗道歉法例嘅利與弊。

473
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:51,650
誒或者講一兩個例子，如果誒道歉法例係通過咗嘅話，就一方面係可以提出同埋促進咗和解嘅機會。誒誒，正我所講到嘅擔憂，譬如話會唔會因為有誒道歉而誒導致到法律上邊有責任要？

474
01:38:51,650 --> 01:39:11,660
要承受或者係一個舉證嘅問題，呢方面嘅誒疑慮，希望係可以消除咗。而另一方面，誒有啲反對嘅聲音咧，就覺得道歉法例會唔會其實有啲係助長咗一啲言不由衷嘅道歉，或者會令訴訟本身係更加複雜化。譬如基本上，首先要決定某一行嘅道歉。

475
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:18,200
本身係咪受到法律嘅保護？咁呢個係喺文件裏邊咧都有詳細作出研究嘅。

476
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:34,910
誒公眾諮詢咧會喺誒二零一五年八月三號結束嘅，督導委員會咧就會屆時就住誒喺呢個諮諮詢期裏邊蒐集到公眾同埋誒持份者嘅意見咧，作出最後嘅決定嘅。

477
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:55,810
誒主席，黃國英大律師咧就會隨後介紹文件裏邊有關嘅主要嘅建議。咁或者誒，我可以將呢個時間畀幾畀啊黃大律師，多謝主席。咁跟住我哋就請調解督導委員會黃國英資深大律師介紹。

478
01:39:56,020 --> 01:40:16,030
啊！主席誒，多謝立法會司法及誒法律事務委員會咧，喺今日咧，畀誒調解督導委員會一個機會去簡介喺今日誒發表嘅係在香港製定道歉法例諮詢文件嘅建議。咁諮詢文件咧提出誒七項建議。咁依次序咧就係第一。

479
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:34,730
喺香港製定道歉法例。第二咧就係道歉法例咧適用於民事及其他形式嘅非刑事法律程序，就包括誒紀律處分程序。第三咧就係道歉法例咧涵蓋誒全面道歉。第四道歉法例咧就適用於政府。

480
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:55,020
第五咧就道歉法例咧係係明文定明咧以道歉方式承認申索咧，就事效條例而言咧就唔構成對訴訟權作出承認，因而咧就延伸咗誒嗰個誒訴訟嘅時效。第六咧就係誒道歉法誒例明。

481
01:40:55,020 --> 01:41:15,030
明文定明咧，道歉唔會影響道歉者就道歉涉及嘅事宜嘅誒保險單嘅承保範圍咧誒受到影響嚇。最後咧第七咧就係道歉法例咧係以獨立成章嘅誒形式制定嗱噉，因為誒今日時間關係咧。

482
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:35,040
我就打算只係就誒二三六七四項誒建議咧作出一個誒簡介啦。啊，第二第二項咧就係話誒法個誒適用嘅誒法律程序嚇。咁呢項建議咧就係建議誒道歉法例咧只係適用於民事或者其他。

483
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:55,050
刑事嘅非誒刑事誒法律程序啦，噉就包括誒紀律處分程序嘅嚇，但係就唔適用於誒刑事案件。咁首先咧就就紀律處分程序咧，就實誒要要好清楚講明咧，就係道歉咧就唔有一個效果咧，去誒影響。

484
01:41:55,050 --> 01:42:15,060
到誒提起或者誒進行關於誒譬如專業失當嘅誒誒嘅誒紀律程序嘅嚇，或者點去證明道歉唔影響去證明誒有有誒專業失當嘅行為嚇誒，只係咧亦都同樣係相同於。

485
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:23,200
喺其他嘅民事程序誒一樣誒道歉法例嘅效力咧，只係去釐清道歉嘅法律效力嘅啫。

486
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:43,730
嚇，咁而知喺呢一行之下咧，誒諮詢文件亦都有提及誒規管法律程序。咁規管法律程序係指涉及誒規管機構根據成文法則行使規管權力嘅法律程序啦。咁例子就譬如係市場失當行為審裁處啊，或者誒證券及期貨事務。

487
01:42:43,730 --> 01:43:03,740
上訴審裁處誒之前提起嘅法律程序啦，咁誒就呢一項誒就忽道歉法例應唔應該適用於法律誒規管法律程序咧？咁度誒調解督導委員會係歡迎公眾人士誒及到持份者咧對呢項議題發表意見嘅嚇。

488
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:23,750
噉就呢一點咧，我哋冇一個誒既定嘅誒建議嚇。希望考慮埋誒公眾人士對誒呢一方面嘅反應，先作出誒建議嚇。咁第三項咧就係誒道歉法例咧，係涵蓋誒全面道歉嗱。咁誒全面道歉嘅。

489
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:43,760
誒意思咧，就係話一個承認法律責任或者過失嘅道歉。咁相對於全面道歉咧，就有有限度道歉。咁有限度道歉係指咧唔承認法律責任或過失嘅道歉。嗱，咁喺呢方面咧，我哋考慮過喺外國誒嘅一啲研究咧。

490
01:43:43,760 --> 01:44:03,770
就顯示咧全面嘅道歉咧，比有限嘅道歉或者唔道歉咧，就可以更有效地使到爭議得到和解嚇。因為咧，承認法律責任或者過失嘅道歉咧，係更加能夠提高道歉對象誒接納和解嗰個意願嘅嚇。咁咧，呢個結論咧亦。

491
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:15,560
都係同加拿大誒最新嘅道歉法例，同埋誒誒剛才提及過嘅蘇格蘭嘅道歉法令草案所採用嘅立誒立法方式係一致嘅。

492
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:36,290
咁而誒喺呢一個誒呢一行建議底下咧誒，亦都牽涉到一個如何定義誒道歉嘅問題。咁嗱，因為有時人道歉咧就唔係淨係單止講一句對唔住嘅，好多時咧誒道歉者咧會會嘗試繼續去。

493
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:56,300
解釋誒，究竟誒問題出錯咗喺邊一度咁誒？呢度引申出嚟呢一種情況引申出嚟有一個問題就係話喺道歉嘅過程之中所作嘅事實陳述咧，應唔應該誒被視為道歉嘅一部分而受到法例保護咧？咁呢個咧就係存在咗一個。

494
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:16,310
法律詮釋嘅誒問題，咁呢一方面咧就誒目前嚟講喺其他有道歉法例嘅誒普通法誒司法管轄區咧，就未有誒好清楚嘅成文條例去去去規管。咁但係咧喺誒最新嘅，剛才提過蘇格蘭。

495
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:36,320
嘅道歉法令草案裏邊咧，就提出咧道歉咧，要包括關乎道歉嘅作為、不作為或後果所作出嘅事實陳述。咁但係該個嗰個法案咧，其實而家咧只係進行到喺誒二零一五五年嘅三月咧提交咗畀蘇格蘭議會，就誒未。

496
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:56,330
係進行辯論嘅，咁誒道歉法例應唔應該涵蓋埋誒誒跟隨道歉所作出嘅事實陳述咧？就各有其利弊嚇。贊成嘅主要論據咧，誒簡單，譬如舉一個例子嚟講咧，就係如果事實陳述咧唔唔受到保護嘅話咧，咁道歉嘅人可能。

497
01:45:56,330 --> 01:46:16,340
只係可以作出一句好轟動嘅做道歉，即係講一句I'm sorry嚇噉，就可能會令到道歉誒誒起唔到誒全面嘅意義或者誒作用嚇噉。但係另一方面，反對嘅論據咧就係話，如果事實陳述唔可以接納為證據嘅話咧，誒受害嗰一方嗰個身

498
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:36,350
拘束或者會受到不利嘅影響，甚至喺某啲情況之下咧，或者遭到扼殺嚇。因為如果譬如話所道歉過程之中所透露嘅事實係唔可以從一般民事程序誒底下嘅任何誒誒誒條例可以得到披露嘅話咧，就會影響。

499
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:47,450
講到申索人進行訴訟嗰個誒過程嚇，噉啊呢一點咧，因為呢個係一個喺喺調解法例裏邊都係一個喺誒道歉法例裏邊係一個好。

500
01:46:47,730 --> 01:47:07,740
好可以講係一個好先進嘅發展啦，咁誒暫時亦都未有未有先例可換，咁所以呢一點咧，條街督導委員會咧就未有一個既定嘅誒建議，亦都希望係邀我哋會邀請誒持份者同埋公眾人士發表意見誒，畀我哋考慮嚇，咁咧。

501
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:27,750
另外咧就第六個咧就係關於誒對保險合約嘅道歉對保險合約嘅影響。咁呢一個建議咧就係誒點解會會出現咧？就因為誒其實好普遍地咧，好多保險嘅合約裏邊咧會有明文就係誒規管住受保人咧唔可以作。

502
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:33,070
出道歉或者承認誒誒過失嘅嘅誒誒陳述。

503
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:53,470
咁好多人誒唔願意道歉，因為除咗考慮到誒會引起誒民事責任或者其他法律責任之外咧，亦都係擔心咧會令到嗰個保險合約無效。噉我哋所以建議咧就誒係誒喺法條道歉條例裏邊咧係需要有明文規定。

504
01:47:53,470 --> 01:48:13,480
咧就係作出道歉，唔會影響誒受保人誒所得到嘅喺保單得到嘅保障嘅嚇。咁誒而最後咧，我哋建議係誒道歉法例咧，應該係以一個獨立嘅法例誒去去定定嚇。嗯嗰個。

505
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:32,290
個另一個做法當然就可以喺現行嘅其他法例裏邊誒加入誒有關嘅條文啦，譬如誒調解條例啊，或者係誒證據條誒evidence ordinance證據條例啊噉樣。但係我哋考慮到咧喺誒誒。

506
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:52,580
道歉法例要有效運作咧，係關鍵咧，要公眾係對公對道歉法例咧有適當嘅認識，誒，亦都需要誒道歉法例誒可以有有個鮮明獨立嘅存在嚇。咁所以咧，我哋就建議咧誒，讀誒道歉法例咧應該獨立成章。

507
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:58,760
一個獨立成章嘅法例，而唔係喺其他現行法例裏邊嘅嘅誒。

508
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,250
單一一啲幾個誒條文嚇。

509
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:23,770
咁誒呢個係我對誒諮詢文警嘅七項建議嘅簡介。咁誒當然我哋歡迎誒回應任何議員嘅問題。好多謝阿黃國英資深大律師喺我請大律師公會嘅代表發言之前咧誒，我咧都係有需要咧延長最多今。

510
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:43,780
今日嘅會議十五分鐘噉，以便陣間咧就係委員或者我自己本人咧都會係跟進大家即係啊今日提出嘅問題嘅咁咧就啊而家咧我哋就請香港大律師公會嘅代表就係啊MissKimMargaretRooney，please。

511
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:57,860
Thank you very much, Madam Chair and members of the Legislative Council Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services. On behalf of the Hong Kong Bar Association, I thank you very much for this opportunity to.

512
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:01,040
Makes some brief comments on behalf of the bar to you.

513
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:21,340
As you know, and we've heard the consultation paper has been released. The bar has not yet had an opportunity to read it. But what we just wished to say was express in principle support for the proposal, or in fact what's happening at the question of whether there should be apology legislation dealing with the making of apologies for the.

514
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:41,350
目的為提升結算，值得全面考慮。我們同意這點，敬請諒解。我們同意推動此項立法的動機，正如我所説，我的理解是，巴方希望在諮詢期間提交或提出意見。謝謝。好，咁咧就誒。

515
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:44,410
多謝啊啊，Miss Rooney，就誒。

516
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:54,360
就住呢個問題咧，就我自己咧就有好幾個問題想跟進嘅，噉我哋亦都咧就係啊想啊。

517
01:50:54,780 --> 01:51:03,330
督導委員會啦，同埋誒可能大律師公會嘅代表，如果佢想參與嘅都係可以㗎。嗱，首先我自己個人係非常歡迎。

518
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:06,400
有呢一個諮詢文件，但係咧。

519
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:26,940
誒，我係未曾有機會睇到裏邊嘅具體內容㗎。嗱，咁咧今頭先梁國雄議員舉咗手，噉就為免方便討論啦。噉我哋就開始計時，噉就誒，我哋都係五分鐘嚇。咁咧就誒，喺道歉條例提出咧，其實你哋有好似幾次。

520
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:46,950
國際研討會，我有機會咧都有出席咗其中一兩個咧，係尤其是喺外國嘅啊與會者同我哋分享佢哋嘅誒實踐咧，我覺得係即係非常值得香港參考嘅。咁作為啊立法會議員咧，其實我哋日常咧都經常去處理好多呢一啲民間嘅紛爭。

521
01:51:47,150 --> 01:52:07,160
誒頭先你就提到咧，譬如係一啲係事故嘅問題啦嚇。當然有醫療事故，我最記得嗰位嘅代表係同我哋分享喺外國醫療事故裏邊咧，第誒好多受害者誒，好期待有一個道歉。咁咧就誒，我自己亦都處理好多法團嘅紛爭。啊，法團紛爭咧唔好睇小咧，佢其實好。

522
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:11,790
可能好少好少嘅利益，搞好耐好耐，就係為咗一句道歉。

523
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:32,080
咁所以咧，如果我哋能夠有一個道歉條例係作為一個誒比較好嘅指引咧，其實可能有利於咧喺調解嘅過程中，甚至雙方當事人咧，佢就明白其實大家咧誒都可以考慮咧，其實係誒唔使一定係咁硬頸，而係因為你又願意做一個道歉咧。

524
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:35,550
係可以有機會令到事情係調解嘅。

525
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:55,840
咁但係咧，頭先即係誒特別係啊，黃之森大律師啦，佢提到有幾點，我覺得當然係誒，我覺得係in the right track，即係係一個正確嘅方向。但係我亦都想即係啊，查問一下，即係第一咧嗱，如果係譬如喺嗰度協調例裏邊有一方嘅當事人。

526
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:15,850
佢誒係唔願意，佢係唔願意去道歉嚇。佢佢係違反咗呢一個嘅誒誒嗰個嘅誒，譬如決定。我哋希望佢道歉，佢唔道歉。咁究竟會係產生啲乜嘢嘅後果咧？嗱，呢個我想瞭解一下你哋誒諗緊嘅，即係係咪強制嘅道歉咧？嚇咁如果佢。

527
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:35,860
違反呢啲強制要求佢道歉嘅決定，佢又有啲乜嘢嘅後果呢？咁咁第二咧，如果我頭先聽落嚟，你哋話係包括全面嘅道歉，即係話咧都容許有由有限度嘅道歉到全面嘅道歉嘅，即係我聽落去咧就係容許佢哋作出有限度嘅道歉。如果佢有限度嘅道歉，即係話佢嗰個。

528
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:40,760
聲稱裏邊咧，就係表示佢唔帶有任何法律嘅責任。

529
01:53:41,120 --> 01:54:01,130
咁會唔會嗰個形式就好似有時我哋嗰啲律師函件裏邊就寫住without prejudice，即係大概係一個同樣嘅一種嘅誒效果，即係我道嗰個人係道歉咗，佢希望咧，以便大家唔好麻煩啦嚇。但係咧就唔代表我就佢就承認咗任何嘅過失嚇。咁會唔會係？

530
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:21,140
去到噉嘅法律效力咧，即係我就亦都想委員會係啊，同我哋可以解釋一下。第三咧就係你再三提到，即係而家嗰個諮詢嘅空間咧，就係喺嗰個規管嘅方面咧，就你哋係冇一個啊規管法例嗰個方面誒，可唔可以再清楚少？

531
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:41,150
少可能令到咧，第日公眾去啊提出意見嘅時候咧，即係你你點為之嗰個喺規管法定程序嗰方面咧，係容許多少少誒空間嘅。噉我諗我係想係提出呢三方面嘅問題。噉我都係得五分鐘，所以你有分兩鐘回應我嘅問題係啊，雲。

532
01:54:41,150 --> 01:55:01,160
大律師係嗱誒，其實咧，我諗可能呢度或者誒呢個唔係一個唔普誒，唔係一個誒，唔唔係經常出現嘅誤解嘅，就係誒一好多人聽到話誒apology legislation就以為呢一個係一個可以強制人道歉嘅法例，咁其實唔係嘅。

533
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:21,170
如果嗱，雖然今日我哋冇一個誒擬定咗個草案誒畀誒委員會參考啦，但係如果我好簡單咁講咧，其實誒我哋所構思緊嘅道歉法例裏邊咧，有誒三個誒好重點嘅。第一個咧就係道歉喺法律上唔構成承認法律責任嚇。

534
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:41,180
咁道歉呢個只全面道歉啦。第二咧就道歉咧不得被接納為用以證明法律責任嘅證證誒據。第三咧就係道歉唔可以作為裁定法律責任嘅考慮因素。咁所以咧其實我哋今次提出誒考慮喺香港誒定。

535
01:55:41,180 --> 01:56:01,190
立道歉法例咧，目的係鼓勵人道歉，而目的就係話咧誒一個誒一個誒道歉咧，好多時就可以誒解決和解一個糾紛，或者係起碼唔好令到誒個糾紛惡化嚇。咁而完全唔存在誒有任何。

536
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:21,200
嘅誒意圖係去強制任何人作出道歉嘅，成個過程係必須要自願嚇。咁所以同樣地咧，亦都係話我哋係呢個呢個法例，既佢不係適用於全面道歉，咁固然佢亦都係一定適用於誒，所以非全面。

537
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:41,210
有限度嘅道歉啊，咁有但有限度嘅道歉咧，我哋係指嗰啲唔誒表示歉意，但係唔係承認法律責任嘅嘅道歉，譬如話誒表示遺憾啊，表示同情誒嗰類嘅嘅嘅誒陳述嚇，咁呢個係係包含嘅嚇。咁當然有冇效就係另一個問題。

538
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:55,810
係啦，相對於誒誒收到呢個道歉嘅人有冇效就係另一個問題嚇。咁另外第三就係嗰個誒誒規管誒誒程序嗰度咧。咁其實個問題係係出喺邊咧？就係誒。

539
01:56:56,090 --> 01:57:16,100
我哋好清晰就係誒認為誒道歉條例唔應該適用於刑事程序嚇。咁但係非刑事程序嗰個定義好廣泛嚇，除咗一般我哋喺法院或者係仲裁或者係誒各類誒tribunal所見嘅程序之外咧，亦都有呢啲叫做誒regulatory proceedings。

540
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:31,990
嚇，咁呢個咧，佢同一般嘅民事程序好唔同，佢其實係介於民事同刑事之間，咁個問題比較複雜，咁所以我哋係係需要諮詢公眾。好好嚇，得，咁跟住我哋畀阿梁國雄議員。誒，第一。

541
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:37,650
即係，我覺得道歉法例適用於政府。

542
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:45,020
即係個意思就話涵蓋，即係政府都可以引用呢個呢個法嚟道歉啦，係咪噉嘅意思啊？OK，明白嘅。

543
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:49,420
我覺得係有啲貢獻嘅，因為大部分嘅。

544
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,900
唔願意道歉嘅都係同誒。

545
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:54,690
保險有關啦，係咪？因為。

546
01:57:54,970 --> 01:58:05,540
如果你走鬼咗去道歉，嗰個保嗰個保險公司個policy就係話：喂，走你無端端噉樣認我唔賠畀你。咁呢個咧誒，你講嗰隻A。

547
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:12,660
F嗰個即係第第六點咧係有疑嘅，喺香港一定有疑。我我處理咗好多啲噉嘅。

548
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:15,710
啊嘢啦！第二咧就係。

549
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:19,970
我想請教你咧，就係話誒。

550
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:21,980
如果，

551
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:40,020
如果一個人走去誒做呢啲噉嘅誒聲明之後咧，你你話誒，因為誒你講咗三大原則啊嘛，唔會構成法律責任，唔會係誒證據嘅一部分，亦都唔係裁定法律責任嘅因素啊嘛，係咪？咁即係話其實佢。

552
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:42,910
誒，即係冇乜損失嘅道歉。

553
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:48,040
應該係咁講啊，係咪？即係話佢喺法律嘅權利上面嘅損失係等於零咯。

554
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:49,980
係，明白。

555
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:53,150
係得到鼓勵去道歉。

556
01:58:53,600 --> 01:59:08,670
而從而希望誒佢嘅道歉得到被接受，而可以令到個糾紛以一個誒和氣圓滿嘅方式解決。明白，但係但係如果佢喺個事實陳述嗰度，的確係陳述咗啲嘢嘅時候咧。

557
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:17,460
咁如果有人誒攞去打官司嘅時候，佢即係嘅嗰個審審案嗰個法官唔可以採納，定係乜嘢啊？

558
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:37,750
因為譬如而家我道歉，我啊真係唔好意思啦。我乜乜乜乜講咗啲陳述出嚟，咁可能喺第日嘅非刑事法律程序或者紀律處分程序嗰度，可能被引用為證據嘅一部分㗎嘛。係咪個法法庭係唔受理啊？或者係嗰個紀律處分嘅機構都唔應該受理呢啲證據？

559
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,090
係咪咁規定？

560
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:59,510
嗱，呢一呢一點咧，就係其實喺其他誒有道歉條例嘅普通法司法管轄區裏邊咧，都係存在嘅一個唔清晰嘅問題，就係做道歉嘅定義係包含淨係嗰句I'm sorry啊，定係包括埋誒去解釋。

561
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:19,520
誒事情點解發生個出錯嗰個嗰個部嗰個事實嘅陳述嚇咁呢樣咧？其實喺其他普普通法地區咧都係唔清晰嘅，噉就存在咗個定義嘅問題。咁嗱呢一個咧，其實係唯一就係喺誒誒蘇格蘭嗰個道歉。

562
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:36,350
誒條誒條例草案嗰度咧係有提出呢一點，咁但係嗰個草案咧，其實而家仲係喺誒蘇格蘭嘅議會裏邊誒，只係剛剛提出，就未有誒好詳細嘅辯論。咁嗱誒喺呢一點咧。

563
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:57,560
道歉法例涵唔涵蓋呢啲誒事實陳述咧？其實有利有弊嘅嚇。嗯，我剛剛都提過誒，譬如最大嘅誒問題就係，如果你個你唔保障呢啲事實陳述咧，咁好多時你只係可以講一句話對唔住咧，咁好多時。

564
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:17,570
誒接受呢個接納誒被道歉嘅一方咧，可能覺得呢個係一個冇意義嚇誒，亦都令佢唔滿足嘅道歉嚇。咁但係誒相反嚟講誒，你正正剛剛指出一個問題，就係話，如果呢啲事實陳述都得到保障嘅話咧，就可能令到誒。

565
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:37,580
個誒受到傷害嗰一方，將來喺法庭舉證有問題，誒會有難度。尤其是係一啲一啲事實係冇，譬如話誒冇冇文件可以助證嘅。譬如如果嗰件事情嘅發生嘅經過，譬如一個醫療事故噉樣樣，可能醫院有好多好詳細嘅記錄，佢唔需要隱。

566
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:57,590
用誒誒醫院或者醫生道歉所作嘅陳事實陳述都可以通過一般正常嘅民事程序去令到呢啲誒資料得到披露嘅嚇。咁喺呢啲情況咧，其實就應該唔構成問題嘅。但係我哋喺我哋個考慮過程之中咧，我哋都想象到有啲情況咧。

567
02:01:57,590 --> 02:02:17,600
真係，如果唔可以引用呢個事實陳述嘅話咧，咁可能原告咧就佢個申訴好好有好大問題嘅。我我哋誒過程之中討論嘅一啲例子，譬如話交通意外嚇，咁個司機撞到人，然之後話啊對唔住，我剛剛講緊手提電話啊咁嚇，或者我剛剛恰咗。

568
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:37,610
眼瞓啊噉，咁呢啲就係你可能唔可以通過誒specific discovery呢類噉嘅程序去攞到呢啲噉嘅資料嘅，噉啊正正因為我哋睇到利弊雙方都都有佢嘅道理，咁所以我哋就唔想喺呢一方面咧誒誒往下判斷，就喺特別。

569
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:53,150
喺呢一點度咧，係邀請誒有關嘅持份者同埋公眾人士誒發表意見，等我哋可以好圓滿咁去考慮呢個問題嚇。但係我哋我哋係係誒睇得到呢一點係係具爭議嘅嚇。

570
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:55,320
好。唔係唔係噉啊！係。

571
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,140
我都冇，我唔係，我唔係好明嘅，因為點解咧？如果你話，

572
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:07,300
誒嗰啲嘢係唔可以喺將來嘅訴訟裏邊作為證即係證據嘅話，咪解決咗呢個問題咯。咁但係你。

573
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:11,980
解決咗個問題，因為我我講咗嘅事實陳述。

574
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:32,550
將來唔可以畀人引用作為一個嗱誒，你唔我唔可以。譬如誒，你向我道歉，然之後解釋畀我聽有個事實陳述，解釋畀我知事情點樣發生咧。我將來喺法庭上咧，如果呢個事實陳述係受到保例保護嘅話咧，我就喺法庭上，我唔可以講話，我唔可以引用你。

575
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:52,560
你話畀我知呢件事，但係我可以從正常嘅其他民事程序，誒誒，司庫副司長容許嘅嘅其他嘅方法，去從你身上得到啲證據，譬如我要你披露有關嘅文件，而顯示而呢啲文件係顯示到誒嗰件事情發生嘅經過。

576
02:03:52,560 --> 02:04:12,570
我只係唔可以引用道歉嗰人所講嘅嘢啫。冇錯，明白。咁誒，首先咧就係誒，我其實排咗第二輪，我對呢個道歉條例係非常之感興趣，亦都係好鼓舞。你哋終於有呢個突破，覺得如果呢一屆咧，我哋又做一啲真係實實在在有一啲嘢突破咧，我覺得道歉。

577
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:32,580
條例，我希望你哋一路到尾能夠咧見到效，因為我係知道好多普通嘅人咧，佢去到無論調解或者係打官司，我哋真係幫過好多人，佢最後都係真係為咗一個説法，呢個係事實嚟嘅。咁所以咧，我係好鼓勵我哋，亦都會。

578
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:52,590
會今日係第一日嚇收到個文件，咁希望各界都可以參與。咁咧頭先啊黃大律師提到咧就係誒你係話嗰個誒，即係我問你嗰個問題係規管一啲法律程序，就係regulatory proceeding誒，即係嗰個係規管性嘅一啲程序。即係我想只係想了解多少。

579
02:04:52,590 --> 02:05:12,600
少係唔係就係指一啲紀律聆訊嘅程序，又或者證監會甚至監警會，即係佢係一啲係有一個係規管性質嘅。咁呢一啲有時都會喺中間查查問到某一個情況，佢可能係有一個啊需要誒有一個道歉嘅。有時即係我哋都會見。

580
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:32,610
個呢啲情況嗱，第二咧，我自己就誒應該係理解就係頭先你提到嘅，就係話不可陳述。其實我哋而家呢個道歉條例話容許多一個渠道係可以誒，促使啲人道歉咧，係冇冇任何負面影響。現在任何嘅民事程序，你。

581
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:52,620
仍然可以喺任何現有享有嘅民事程序裏邊得到嘅披露或者申請嘅資料，你仍然可以爭取。只不過咧喺嗰個道歉嘅呢個條例裏邊，如果佢係道歉，佢係全面或者有限度啦。尤其是有限度就更加豁免咗某一啲情況，就誒。

582
02:05:52,690 --> 02:06:05,940
佢係佢講嘅事實陳述咧，就未必可以直接係引述啦。噉，我認為咧，道歉呢一個嘅情況只係一個plus嚟嘅啫，一個我哋可能促進咗喺某一啲嘅誒訴訟。

583
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:26,230
啊，或者一啲其實佢當事人係真係冇咁多錢嘅噉嘅情況，中間可以促進到譬如和解或者其他嘅。噉我諗誒，如果我呢個理解，特別喺譬如紀律聆訊，即係regulatory proceeding，喺呢個聆訊喺呢一方面嘅，我想睇下黃大律師會唔會係有簡短嘅補充嚇？因為我哋咧就。

584
02:06:26,230 --> 02:06:29,350
就到啊四十五分就要停止嘅啦，嚇！

585
02:06:29,650 --> 02:06:49,660
誒，我哋就誒目前嘅建議咧，就係誒適用於民事誒法律程序。噉我哋定義民事法律程序咧，其實係包含紀律處分程序嘅嚇。咁而另外一類叫做誒，我哋叫做規管法律程序咧，就係指一啲規管機構係根據。

586
02:06:49,660 --> 02:07:09,670
成文法例之下擁有行可以行使嘅規管權力嘅法法律程序。咁剛剛我哋誒舉過嘅例子咧，就係譬如誒market misconduct tribunal啊，或者係誒證券及期貨事務上訴審裁處誒所處理嘅嘅法律程序嚇係。

587
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:15,560
就有有呢個界定，好多謝。咁誒，大律師公會，any additional remarks？

588
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:34,100
啊，thank you。OK，啊噉我哋時間啱啱好，亦都多謝大家今日咧就係啊繼續留到六點四十五六點四十五分啊，差唔多嚇。噉我哋多謝大家先嚇，咁咧就誒今日咧就正式誒結束會議嘅，多謝。
