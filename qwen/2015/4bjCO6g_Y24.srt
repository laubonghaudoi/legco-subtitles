邊個啊？Henry？

28
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:49,230
啊！誒，或者我介紹下今次我哋要求修訂誒規程嘅主要嘅目的，就誒主要係香港大學嘅條誒條例嗰個規程三，就係咧就即係我哋每一次要頒發新嘅學位咧，我哋就要即係修改呢個。

29
00:03:49,230 --> 00:04:09,240
個誒規程嘅咁呢次，我哋想加入三個新學位，一個就係文科碩士啊，英語第二語言教學就係Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages。第二個就臨牀藥劑學碩士Master of Clinical Pharmacy。第三。

30
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:29,250
三個啫係表達藝術治療碩士，Master of Expressive Arts Therapy。咁呢啲誒誒誒修訂誒規程嘅內容咧，係由經過香港大學嘅誒有誒學學係學院、教務委員會、校務委員會同埋校董會通過。咁

31
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:43,200
我哋都有諮詢過教育局同埋法律草擬專員，噉啊法律草擬專員畀咗啲意見我哋，我哋已經都加入咗喺個修訂規規程之中，噉啊嗯。

32
00:04:43,560 --> 00:05:03,570
今日我哋有三位對於呢個課程即係有關嘅同事啊，一位就係我哋嘅教育學院嘅院長Professor誒誒誒Angels，嚇，另外一位就係藥劑誒藥理藥理藥藥劑學係嘅主任黃志記黃志基教授，同埋社會公

33
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:18,820
工作個社會行政學係嘅副教授啊何天雄博士咁嚇噉佢哋就三位就會啊啊啊解釋下佢哋啲課程啊同埋啊回答嘛議員對啲課程要提出嘅問題。好，多謝主席。

34
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,230
一。

35
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,100
語言。

36
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,690
多謝你賜畀我依個機會。

37
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,150
Okay, professor, sorry.

38
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,840
Can you give a brief rundown or an explanation of your master' degrees?

39
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:56,440
Yes, if I can just briefly introduce the the M.A. and T. So this is a a new programme which is a major initiative for us because it's the first time that we've actually run a programme at masters level in collaboration with another faculty, and that's why it needed to be proposed as a brand new programme in the in previous years over a number of.

40
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,800
years we have developed.

41
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,180
Under our master of education programme, a number of different specialisms. But in this case.

42
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:24,540
因為這是一個我們在與另一個學院合作提供的課程，它需要被提出作為一個獨立的課程，因此我們提出了這個碩士課程，即教英語給講其他語言的人，我們與藝術學院的應用英語研究中心合作，它代表了。

43
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:38,880
給我們一個機會，去和另一個大學領域合作，這個領域有補充的專業知識，是在英語作為第二和外語。這是一個專門針對

44
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:59,200
Full-time students. Our master's education programme started as a UGC-funded programme entirely for part-time students. Then, as it's gone through the transformation from mixed mode to self-funded, we've also admitted full-time students onto that programme. But this MA programme is a a new programme.

45
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:15,710
It's entirely full-time and it's intended to target students from outside Hong Kong. One of the reasons for that is that we see our mission as being to serve continuing professional development, not just within the Hong Kong context, but more widely.

46
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:27,040
and also we want to try and bring more international non-Hong Kong students into our faculty because our undergraduate programmes are very very locally focused and and it's one of our

47
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:40,680
aims to try and enrich the overall diversity of the experience within our faculty by having more students from outside Hong Kong with us. So, so that was one of the the prime motivations.

48
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,770
和 programme very much.

49
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:52,190
fills a niche which our existing master in education programmes in relation to teaching use of foreign language don't.

50
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,850
don't meet. So that was the rationale for the proposal of this programme.

51
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:09,080
或者個位同事等我等誒另外啲誒香港大學教授講完先問問題好唔好啊？嚇咁咧，因為有啲業者同同你哋機會聽聽黃教授。

52
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:30,690
誒，我哋呢一個嘅Master of Clinical Pharmacy呢個program咧，係一個新嘅program。咁誒，我諗大家都知一個，有啲係講曬中文，一係講英文。喺依度即係唔係好難翻譯嗰啲嚇。Okay, that's fine。可以兩個都講。Yeah, I'm going to use English. Um, the Master of Clinical Pharmacy program is a brand new program. As far as we know, the medicine that we use nowadays

53
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:50,720
Getting more and more advanced and more and more expensive, so we need the expert in the medicine to help us to use the medicine better. And also, the second problem that we are facing is the ageing population, is a well-wild problem. So indeed, because of this two problem, the healthcare profession they need to progress further in the education of the medicine science.

54
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,270
how to use medicine.

55
00:08:52,550 --> 00:09:11,180
And so the University of Hong Kong already set up the Bachelor of Pharmacy degree few years ago, and so it's a natural progression that we provide a Master of Clinical Pharmacy, so that we can actually teach our pharmacists the advanced skills of how to use the medicine, and so the programme.

56
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:31,470
是specifically only for the Hong Kong registered pharmacists, so no other people can be admitted to it without the Hong Kong registration as a pharmacist in Hong Kong. And it is only do it in part time because again, it is specifically to help the local pharmacists to upgrade their skills. And majority of our

57
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:51,480
學生係從HA，and also因為這是Requirement for the HA for the junior pharmacists，what we call them the resident pharmacists to be progressed into pharmacists，they have to have a master degree and preferably it would be in master clinical pharmacy。所以我們基本上係幫助當地社區提升他們的知識和。

58
00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:11,490
Help them to provide the service to the local hospital and including the HA and also the hospital in the private settings. So it is fully self-funded by the student themselves. And so the the programme we use a lot of practitioners that they are they have advanced practice and so that they can actually.

59
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:26,070
transfer the skills to our students, and also we invite overseas professors and lecturer to give distant learning, and sometimes they actually fly here to actually transfer the skill. So this is the essence of the programme.

60
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:46,360
多謝，Thank you，誒誒Professor黃，誒想請請誒誒學博士可以介紹你嗰個碩士。誒我上次用中文嚇，嗯，其實誒呢個表達藝術治療碩士咧係一個新嘅誒誒課程嚟嘅，噉佢亦都係亞洲區咧基本上係第一個嘅專業嘅課程，係一。

61
00:10:46,360 --> 00:11:06,370
個誒誒全職嘅話咧，讀咧就係兩年啊；兼職讀兼讀嘅話咧，係三年一個課程。咁呢個課程嘅設立咧，就係誒其實咧就係基於我哋好多嘅好多年嘅為社會為人類服務嘅時候，我哋發覺到咧語言唔係唯一可以溝通到同埋表。

62
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:26,380
達到嘅一個方式，咁所以咧，但係藝術咧就可以啊做到好多溝通表達嘅一個媒介。咁誒，表達藝術治療呢一樣嘢咧，其實咧就係講緊我哋用唔同嘅藝術表達方式，包括音樂啦、舞蹈啦、戲劇啦、嗯啊繪畫啦，甚至係詩歌去表達、去溝通。

63
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:46,390
而令到咧，我哋係有一啲嘅誒深層次嘅問題啦，或者係一啲成長嘅問題可以得到解決嘅。咁呢一個課程嘅設立咧，喺香港大學嚟講咧，啊有幾個好重要嘅特點嘅。咁其中一個咧就係誒，除咗係應因應我哋嗰個誒市場個需求啦，因為特別係有一啲嘅啊，我哋叫做一

64
00:11:46,390 --> 00:12:06,400
啲嘅誒client group啊，叫做人人人羣，譬如係一啲誒有特別需要嘅學童啦，啊自閉啊，或者係老人家啊，甚至係一啲嘅精神病啊等等咧，佢哋係需要用一啲方法去溝通嘅。咁因為呢一個嘅誒服務咧，係特別能夠咧係針對呢啲人羣，咁所以咧。

65
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:26,410
誒呢個課程咧係誒好需要係設立嘅，喺香港呢個環境裏邊。咁第二個咧就係通過呢個課程嘅設立咧，其實亦都可以促進咧誒大學本身作為一個學術研究機構喺呢一方面嘅一個研究，進而咧可以希望推行到我哋一個叫做實政為本嘅一個誒誒誒。

66
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,800
啊。

67
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:48,090
啊，服務嘅嚇，咁第三個咧就係特別香港大學裏邊咧，我哋係一個中西文化交流嘅一個誒學府嚟嘅。咁正正係噉樣誒，表達藝術治療其實呢樣嘢係西方法源嘅。噉我哋如果能夠加入我哋好多嘅中國或者係啊傳統嘅東方嘅一個文化情緒咧，能

68
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:57,660
能夠係能夠誒更加好噉樣樣係做到一個中西嘅結合，東西嘅結合係可以幫到我哋本地嘅人羣，係一個誒好大嘅特色嚟嘅。

69
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:14,590
多謝曬啊何教授。誒或者噉，我哋誒問問問題啊，葉議員，你可唔介唔介意畀咗佢兩個九點前要走嘅議員先啊？啊啊，睇下佢哋問問題。如果冇冇問題，阿Alan有冇問題？因為你講逐步啊，葉議員。

70
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,170
applaud yours。

71
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,550
好，呢個問題，冇問，誒。

72
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:41,090
誒，我想我想問咧，誒幾個課程咧，誒其實咧，即係嗰個學額係幾多咧？可唔可以即係講講？誒，第二咧就係誒呢三個課程咧，其實都係一啲嘅誒誒學術課程啦，但係亦都係一啲專業嘅課程嚟嘅，即係一啲專業訓練。咁三種課程培養。

73
00:13:41,090 --> 00:14:01,100
出嚟咧都係有一定嘅技術，噉佢哋會唔會涉及到呢個實習嘅問題啦？仲有咧，佢哋會唔會牽涉到專業資格嘅呢個係問題？係三個問題，Henry你誒誒你想答先定係等佢？我相信都係畀翻我哋啲同事。

74
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,040
嗯。

75
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,710
Professor Andrews，你會係第一個回答Mr. Yip。

76
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:16,530
The honourable, your question. Yes, in terms of the the cohort size, the the first the first cohort would be 30.

77
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:34,250
Yes, and it's not intended that this should have any. Certainly for the MATOL, it's not intended to be a professional qualification in any sense. I mean, there is no practicum attached to the the programme as yet. It's it's purely a

78
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:41,050
A knowledge-based programme, so so it's not a not a professional qualification in that sense at all.

79
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,500
Professor Wong。

80
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,100
誒，我哋第一個曲，第一第一班咧，就收咗十九個人。

81
00:14:51,390 --> 00:15:11,400
咁誒跟住咧就收咗誒大約三十個人，咁所以其實我哋嘅誒容量咧係大約二十到三十個，咁因為我哋誒要有誒巡房嘅，咁因為我哋會帶啲學生上去誒巡房，咁所以其實我哋收嘅學生人數咧一定有一個限制，如果唔係我。

82
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,940
我哋冇辦法做得到呢樣嘢。

83
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:33,230
咁同埋另外一樣嘢就係我哋誒會誒，亦都會帶佢哋去到誒香港大學深圳醫院，誒等佢哋去見，即係喺中國嘅嘅實習方法。咁所以，我哋即係我哋有要能夾能夾做得到嘅咧，就係已經限制住一個人數誒。咁誒。

84
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:43,190
你話有冇一個專業資格咧？因為其實喺香港而家嘅誒嘅法例裏邊咧嘅專業資格咧，只係得一個嘅啫，就係香港註冊藥劑師。

85
00:15:43,470 --> 00:16:00,150
咁誒，但係喺一個誒誒喺誒醫管局裏邊咧，就需要一定要有一個誒碩士學位，先至可以做一個誒正式嘅藥劑師。如果唔係之前咧，佢哋就就係啲即係我哋叫。

86
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:07,800
resident pharmacist，咁嗰啲就係低等啲，低即係低層少少嘅。咁所以點解嗰個誒碩士學位係對佢哋咁重要咯？

87
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:29,390
我何博士係我哋第一二年嘅收生咧，就係二十三人嘅，響個響個課程裏邊。咁誒呢個課程係一個專業嘅課程，所以佢係需要實習嘅嚇。咁實習誒之後咧誒實習大概係五百到到七百五十個鐘頭嚇。咁每一個學生都要咁實習之後咧，其實咧我哋希

88
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:42,080
希望咧，佢哋能夠誒喺一個叫做國際表達藝術治療師嘅協會裏邊咧，可以攞到一個專業嘅資格。咁目前咧，香港嚟講咧，就未有呢一個誒註冊嘅制度嘅。

89
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,060
好，阿議員，啊，有冇其他問題？

90
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,000
我我想再問多少少咧，就係誒，係先。

91
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,220
誒嗯。

92
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,960
我頭先有個問題，誒諗起，但係而家已經誒消失咗。

93
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,100
可能要需要接受治療。

94
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,400
有啲，有啲，有啲噉啊。

95
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:30,600
啊，今日暫時冇咩咩問題。如果如果冇問題咧，啊啊，Henry，你可唔可以講講Law Drafting，即係誒，包括誒個DJ嗰邊咧，佢哋叫做咧改咩，改咗邊度，係邊部分，你可以解介紹好嗎？佢誒主要係誒唔叫我哋改格式嘅問題，所以我哋就亦好即係。

96
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:49,650
要普通嘅方法，噉佢哋就要佢哋誒就喺誒幫我哋改咗啲嗰個我哋成交嗰張嗰個文件嗰啲格式，噉就佢冇變過我哋關於我哋啲學位嘅名啊噉樣。如果大家冇問題，係啊個問題突然間翻翻嚟，可能即係唔緊要。

97
00:17:49,930 --> 00:18:09,940
誒主席，誒嗰個問題咧就係誒頭先剛才講到咧係嗰個誒clinical pharmacist，即係呢個臨牀誒藥劑師嗰度咧，就話咧係誒佢需佢哋需要咧一個碩士嘅學位先至能夠誒升為正式嘅藥劑師嘅。咁除咗而家誒提供呢個新嘅課。

98
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:25,490
程之外咧，係咪已經有誒一啲嘅誒同樣嘅，即係碩士課程誒，係令到啲人係可以喺通過香港嘅途徑係可以升到幼師？呢個就係誒想攞多啲資料嘅。Professor啊。

99
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:45,900
其實誒誒香港中文大學同埋誒誒香港大學嘅space，我唔記得space中文名係乜啦嚇，即係我哋嘅校外進修課程，其實都有一個誒誒臨牀藥劑學嘅嘅碩士課程嘅，咁但係誒我哋嗰個課程嗰個誒基本構思同佢哋好唔同，因為我哋。

100
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:55,200
我哋都好着重咧，誒，去到醫院裏邊去學習。咁其他嗰兩個嘅課程咧，大部分都係即係我教你聽。

101
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:15,650
但係，我哋個課程咧就啲學生就要做好多佢哋自己要去揾一啲嘅cases啊。咁同我哋啲教授一齊去討論啊。咁同埋，我哋都用好多誒誒現代嘅科技啦。譬如佢哋可以喺屋企將佢哋啲cases去到present畀我哋，噉就免佢哋因為佢哋。

102
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:35,660
全部都係做緊fulltime嘅全職嘅，噉就容許佢哋同我哋可以噉樣溝通咯，嚇。咁所以其實就已經有呢啲course嘅。咁同埋另外一樣嘢，我都想補充一份點咧，就係其實喺英國咧，其實佢哋個第一個degree咧，就已經係master of pharmacy㗎啦。咁誒，如果你喺美國同埋加拿大咧，好多時佢第一個degree

103
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:46,360
佢咧已經係doctor in pharmacy啦，咁但係我哋香港咧都仲係doctor咧 in pharmacy，咁所以係有一個有一個大嘅需要咧，係有呢啲professional training。

104
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,070
跟住仲有冇第三問題啊？

105
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,720
誒唔係跟住咧就係Amin兩嚇，Thank you, Amin. I I have one誒。

106
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:06,180
小問題，問Professor Andrews。Professor did mention that the programme of the Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages。

107
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,220
was catered for students from outside Hong Kong.

108
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,680
I wonder if the professor could clarify for us how large is the catchment area meant to be.

109
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,910
你係 catching 學生從 where？Professor Andrews。

110
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:43,280
So, yeah. Thank you for the question. The the first cohort is of students are all from the mainland. We hope, and very, it's very much the aim that it should be the whole of the region rather than from the mainland. One of the the difficulties of achieving that goal is is the the cost of the programme. So, one of the things that we're

111
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:51,450
Trying to do is set up a series of scholarships, which will make it more accessible to students from other parts of the region. But at the moment, the first cohort is from the mainland.

112
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,570
嗯。

113
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,320
Can you explain further? That does this affect the resources that should have been given?

114
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,690
到啲 local university， and then you spending。

115
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,190
Expect other money for the the outside Hong Kong cohorts.

116
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,640
Well, I think it's a. It just reflects the challenge that we have for our.

117
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:37,590
to achieve the mission that we would like to achieve, certainly from my point of view, dean of the faculty, one of the things that I see as as very much our mission is to aid capacity building in the in the region. That's something that I'm very very committed to, but it's something that is is very difficult to achieve because we have to we have to charge a certain fee level for ourself.

118
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:45,860
programs, and so the only way we can actually realise that goal is to find other ways to support the the

119
00:21:46,140 --> 00:22:03,520
the study of students who are coming from backgrounds where they don't have the the resources to pay the the full fee, and so this is something that we we're we're trying to set up through. We would already we've already set up some donations to help support scholarship funds for students from

120
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:23,810
from from the the region more widely, but it's it's I think it's a challenge which we can't avoid with with the way we have to charge for self-funded programmes. Yes, but then the question is, how how does this fulfil the objective of integration of local and overseas students to that extent?

121
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,250
嗯。

122
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:40,760
because we are purely, as you said purely, that we have to for this design for the non-Hong Kong students. But in terms of the wider purpose, is to have a better understanding between Hong Kong and

123
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,740
南香港學生。

124
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:49,050
Well, indeed. Well, in in answer to that question, I mean, the students who come on this programme simply.

125
00:22:49,410 --> 00:23:09,420
part of one programme within a very very large range of masters level programmes, so they become part of a community of students. I mean, we have nearly 400 masters students in our faculty who are a mixture of full time and part time, and the part time ones are obviously all

126
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:29,430
The full-time ones come from not just from from the from the mainland because we have been able through scholarships and so on to support people from other. So so they form an integrated community of postgraduate students within the the faculty. For this course, sorry, I just want to follow. No, no, very useful, very helpful. For this course, there are.

127
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:49,440
First, Henry, that there is a twenty percent limitation for overseas student. Does this apply to this course, or I mean, or individual courses? That in the wider context, the twenty percent rule is always being within that rule. For undergraduate only, and in Hong Kong, you we have policy that we.

128
00:23:49,440 --> 00:24:09,450
We use ten for mainland students and ten for overseas students. So that's our policy for undergraduate. There's no restriction for top postgraduate. But the basic principle is that it must be self-funded. We must not use UGC money for the self-funded programme. So

129
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:29,460
當佢哋 calculate the fees， you know， we we have been very careful about the self-funding principle。所以喺一個，we are not really using UGC resources for any TPG programme。黃議員，我幫你問咗你最中意問嘅問題，啊，就關於即係會唔會攞到香港學生嗰個資

130
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:43,670
議員喺度，啊，間間你可以睇翻個recorder嗰度。你有需有冇需要？Alan有冇第二啲問題？If I could just have a last follow-up，呃，do I understand from the good professor that this program is exclusively

131
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:57,170
for students from outside Hong Kong. So even if a local student is applying for admission to the Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages programme, he or she would not be

132
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,690
accepted.

133
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:18,980
Is that the idea, Professor Andrews? Well, thank, thank you. I probably should have set this in context. I mean, we already have within our faculty two master education specialisms which are catering for the local needs. We have a master education in English language education and a master education in English.

134
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:38,990
Language studies, and the latter of those is specifically related to fulfilling scholar requirements for helping serving teachers become subject knowledge trained. And the Centre for Applied English Studies with whom we partner, they have a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics, which is also serving the local needs. So we've we have already three existing programmes.

135
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,830
programs which

136
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:57,160
fulfil different needs within the professional development of the local community, and one of the motivations for creating this programme was to try and clarify the differentiation of roles, so that if we had full-time students who wanted to study a master's in the area from outside Hong Kong, they could be

137
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:06,850
Directed towards the programme which would fit their needs rather than the the other three which weren't specifically designed for them. So, so this really complements.

138
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:27,160
What we already offer for the professional development of the local community. Thank you, Ivonne. Just follow. Really, Professor Andrews, you you haven't really answered that question completely yet. The question is, if a Hong Kong students in search of knowledge wants to enter this course, are they being discriminated?

139
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,870
係。

140
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:48,200
Knowledge, knowledge have no boundary. But I mean, is that a prerequisite that there must be an overseas student? Well, it's not a prerequisite. It's the way we market the program. If if anyone, if anyone, if a local student applies for that particular program, we would advise them to have a look at the other programs which we offer, which are more.

141
00:26:48,200 --> 00:27:08,210
Specifically designed for their needs, and encourage them to. Their needs won't be on their own choice rather than a needs to be directed. I mean, that's the purpose of education. But the question is very simple: if a Hong Kong student have a desire to to join the

142
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,850
Will they be discriminated? I mean, this is the

143
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:32,240
The question, Alan, is that? I mean, well, to answer, I don't think there is anything in the regulations regarding this programme which says that it is exclusively for non-Hong Kong citizens. I mean, it's simply that in the spirit of academic advising, which informs everything that we do within the university about helping students.

144
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:50,660
choose the right thing for them when they've entered the university. We do the same when people apply for programmes. I mean, even with with Hong Kong students who apply for the different programmes that we offer, if a student applies for the Master of Education in English Language Education, and we think that actually what they need to do is the

145
00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:07,160
Master of Education in English Language Studies, because they need to fulfil the scholar requirements, we will strongly advise them to move their application to the other programme because it's designed for them. And in the same spirit, we would do the same for this programme. So it doesn't it doesn't say not.

146
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,920
for Hong Kong, you not for Hong Kong citizens. It's simply

147
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,130
That's the program is designed with a different target audience in mind.

148
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,900
Any other question? Well, chairman, as you know, I always defer to your wisdom.

149
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,530
呃，但。

150
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,210
For the record, as I understand from the good professor.

151
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,160
The answer to my question is, if a local student insists.

152
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,920
On applying to this programme, he or she will be considered for the programme fairly.

153
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,170
唔。

154
00:28:40,550 --> 00:29:00,560
It goes without saying, Chairman. But what the good professor was telling us had been this: that this local student would be advised to look at other programmes which would fit them more. But if they insist, despite...

155
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,900
The very good counsel and advice that they get from the good professor, he or she will be considered.

156
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,330
Right， is that the correct？

157
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:24,280
interpretation of your answers. I mean, I think that is a correct interpretation. I don't think it's been put to the test as yet, but I mean, I think that's a correct interpretation of my answer indeed. Professor Andrew，係跟住就係，啊啊黃飛雲。

158
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:44,790
誒多謝主席，你頭先嘗試幫我問問題，因為你問到我就唔好意思啫。我唔知係唔即係你不嬲問咗好多問題，關於呢一方面。不過呢個問題就未到肉嘅，噉啊留翻你喺度讀問。噉我想問咧，呢三個新加入嘅誒master咧係誒係tut master program。

159
00:29:44,790 --> 00:30:04,800
即係係授課式嘅碩士課程，定還是係誒研究式嘅課程？誒三個都係授課式嘅。比如佢頭先解釋咗，係係係即係好配合我我此一。係係top係授課式。授課式嘅program噉，所以咧就誒，即係佢哋唔係MPhil，亦都唔係PhD嘅program嚟嘅，噉就係。

160
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:13,270
你夾唔夾啊嘛？即係搭咗我哋有個有個有個record喺度嚇。嚇，咁即係其實頭先就誒。

161
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:33,560
你問呢條問題咧，其實就誒，因為我問佢咧有冇用到香港，我知道佢就話係self self finance self funded，唔會用於支資錢啊。嗰度我聽到，即係但係咧，而家係解答唔到我嘅我哋嘅concern就係因為我哋而家concern就好多existing嘅research啊啊。

162
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:45,970
master program or PhD program by research。我聽我可以講啊，我哋可以夾雜喺度啦。而家可以大家都可以用啦啊，趁趁方便，我唔想開多次會啊。咁咧就係誒。

163
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,480
嗰啲咧就唔係self-financed嘅program嘅MPhil、PhD。

164
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:10,770
咁嗰啲咧就分得埋UGC位，啊Henry，係係誒MPhil同埋PhD大部分係分得埋UGC嘅，但係我哋都有啲誒可能係sell fund嘅，但係而家已經越嚟越少啦，啊咁人數涉及UGC fund咧有一定嘅限制嘅，噉就我相信黃院可能就。

165
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:30,780
關心就可能有好多非本地學生嚇，咁呢個係一個事實嚟嘅。主要理由咧就香港啲同學喺本科畢業以後咧，唔係好中意繼續做研究嘅。噉我哋其實喺誒各方面，我哋已經即係做咗好多功夫啊，好似同學喺最後一年咧，我哋揾。

166
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:50,790
老師啊，同我哋講啊，即係做做研究有乜好處啊，成噉樣嚇噉。所以但係但係本地學生都唔係好積極，咁所以我哋都收咗相當誒多數目嘅外嚟學生。但係我哋係盡量避免係從一個地方嚟，所以而家我哋過去個兩兩三年咧，我哋就喺誒即係喺哪？

167
00:31:50,790 --> 00:32:10,800
亞洲方面咧，我哋就做咗好多功夫，就係有誒印度啊、啊巴基斯坦啲同學，我哋就誒就鼓勵佢哋嚟香港嚇。噉我哋都係本地咧，我哋繼續會努力，希望啲同學能夠知道即係做，而且佢哋通常諗法就係誒香港啲誒大專大學。

168
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:30,810
數目少，佢覺得係啲同學做咗誒研究嘅碩士或者博士咧就冇出路，咁呢個其實係錯嘅。我哋都有好多同學去咗，即係喺香港讀完以後咧去外國再再讀博士後啊，咁跟住佢有一個好嘅即係係學術嘅方面嘅發展啊，咁咁所以我哋係仲要做功夫。

169
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:50,820
就啊，都希望社會人士都即係幫我哋手，就係鼓勵喺香港學生繼續即係讀完本科以後，就唔好個個都諗住要即刻即係出去啊揾錢啊，成咁可以有條件嘅話，我應該繼續再讀下即係研究嘅位。唔該你Henry，我我即係我嘅關心咧。

170
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,970
就係誒。

171
00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:07,800
即係當然，我明白你講個情況，因為我自己都喺理工大學教書。誒，即係我關心咧，就係話我哋用公堂咧嘅問題，即係點樣係叫做對香港誒呢一個嘅社羣負責任咁解嘅啫。

172
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,750
誒，我唔係反對大學收非本地生嘅。

173
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:18,830
我係反對咧，就係非本地生同本地生咧，佢嗰個嘅資助係一樣。

174
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,060
誒，但係我哋好多本地嘅學生咧，連入大學嘅機會咧～

175
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,380
都冇喎。

176
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:32,280
即係政府係唔會資助好多即係undergrad嘅學生，或者讀top master嘅本地生。

177
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:50,850
但係咧，就去資助好多唔係香港嘅學生去讀書。嗱，基於個政策嘅問題，即係話嗱，我提過兩個option，一就係一係set個cap啦，即係唔好即係話收非本地生嘅人數多過本地生好多倍噉樣。因為而家成七成八成都係language student，係。

178
00:33:51,130 --> 00:34:11,140
誒噉，政政府就唔得，因為咧本地生唔係咁多人報。好啦，噉我另一個option就係話，我哋會唔會review個financing policy，即係話你係local student咧，你係cost recovery收翻去貴啲學費啦。咁新加坡或者其他國家都係咁㗎，噉你如果嚟讀咧，你就可能要諗其他獎學金啊。

179
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:31,150
啊，譬如話，或者可以噉，或者依個提出去畀education panel可以誒誒誒誒研究，或者擺上去嗰個議案嗰度。但係今日咧，我哋純粹依個依個依個今日香港大學嚟咧，就係關於三個碩士嘅學位喺度。就係因為佢法例上，去

180
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:48,720
需要個，同埋咧要經過咗依個誒大學嗰個事務委員，係咪嗰個叫council啲咩？嗯，校務委員會，校務委員會同意咗，又去senate嗰度又睇過，所以我係純針針對翻喺依三個碩士學位度，好唔好啊？啊！

181
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,700
係啊，葉建。

182
00:34:52,110 --> 00:35:12,120
誒，我想回應阿Allen嘅。其實噉啊，佢就在，因為咧，其實誒頭先講到嗰個誒英語作為第二語言嘅教學嗰個課程咧，誒教學咧其實都好睇嗰個誒地區嗰個特色嘅。咁所以咧誒好多時候咧教學資格咧都唔可以話喺教。

183
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:32,130
嘅地方受訓完之後咧，去粵嘅地方嗰度教書噉，所以咧其實咧係喺個課程上面咧有區分誒唔同地方嘅需要咧。呢個其實喺教育上面咧係有嘅道理嘅嚇。噉我想即係即係同阿阿梁家傑議員講嘅嘢，走咗都唔緊要嘅。我諗唔係即係我我都係同同意楊家。

184
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:52,140
即係即係有個選擇性，就喺個學生嗰度。就算即係有個選擇性喺度咧，雖然佢係從一個教學嘅角度去睇，即係我都係即係我頭先我理解到，所以喺喺個教學嗰度個選擇，即係我哋不嬲都話而家要一個唔好有篩選嘅情況，就係要有一個公平、公開、公。

185
00:35:52,140 --> 00:36:12,150
正嘅角度去睇啦，咁咧即係你係完咗，即係睇香港大學係一個一個學位喺度，而係令到第啲學即係香港本地學生係入唔到去。如果佢有個意願入去，咁咧即係又係好似似乎好難去解釋，因為就算佢唔係用公帑。

186
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:32,160
堂嘅錢，但係大學本身就公堂嘅資助，公堂嘅地，香港資源嚟，所以即係依條。頭先啊，阿Professor都解釋咗，我哋都接受，因為即係依個純粹係去勸喻去做。如果佢佢真係要做嘅，佢咪要靠佢自己嘅能力去入，入唔入得喺度嚇？

187
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:52,490
啊！啊，主席，我好欣賞你，即係係誒，公主張公平公正，冇不合理篩選呢個精神嘅。咁咧就就住另外一件事啊，就住就住，剛才嗰個問題咧，我即係想補充一點咧，就係誒，其實咧睇誒，譬如話香港本地嘅學生想報讀呢個課程嘅話咧，我覺得有一種情況咧，其實都應該。

188
00:36:52,490 --> 00:37:12,500
佢誒積極嘅考慮嘅就係佢可能係諗住去內地教書都未定嘅嚇。如果佢嗰個目的係即係有噉嘅方向嘅話咧，其或者係喺香港以外地方教書嚇，咁誒佢其實都係好值得係去被國際嚇市民啫，係啦，冇錯啦。

189
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:24,870
噉啊，大致上就噉樣。多謝，係冇其他問題咧，我哋進入去第二部分，好唔好啊？第二部分我哋就係睇一睇依個嗯立法會文件C B。

190
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,460
四一零八八。

191
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,110
足十四、十五。

192
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:43,350
零二，我睇咗嗰度咧，或者我咁今次我係希望，如果係我開做今日做完佢唔使開多次會，因為噉我哋而家可以個時間表我講一講，大家有冇依份文件？

193
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:57,990
Professor Andrews，我 just refer to that we now go to event to LC paper CB41088 struck 1415 struck to Harry，有冇呢份文件啊？呢個啊，我哋依個嚇。

194
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,500
唔該，同事，因為。

195
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,760
依個屙依個就係你哋個university hall coordination，university hall coordination式啊！

196
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,930
佢好似有個mark up version，我哋冇。係有個mark up version喺度。

197
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,340
唔緊要啊！哈，Henry哋有，你畀幾位教授都未有啊？

198
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,950
係嘛？

199
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,390
係都好。

200
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,790
啊！

201
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,290
咁講。

202
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,260
畀畀三個percent，佢哋要。

203
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,480
兩副牌成日攞咗好添啊！

204
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,360
誒唔緊要，誒依個我哋即係。

205
00:38:51,160 --> 00:39:11,170
O.K.我睇第一頁嗰度咧，就係依個香港大學嘅條例嗰度誒誒嗰度咧，第一頁就係冇冇冇嘢改嘅。第二頁咧都係冇嘢講，關於講關於碩誒依個誒依個學士碩士學位唔同嘅碩士學位。

206
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:31,180
第三嗰度咧，就只係係一頁嘅啫。依個係頁咧，嗰一嗰一從事睇一睇咧，就係一個mark up copy嚟，即係已經係有嘢要加入去裏邊嘅。加入去裏邊咧，就係喺依個第三頁嗰誒第三頁嗰個裏邊咧，就係加入咗頭先講嗰個英文嗰個。

207
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,290
英文，我係master of arts in teaching English to speakers of other languages，master of clinical。

208
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:50,590
Pharmacy同埋Master of Expressive Arts Therapy，咁咧依三樣嘢加咗去啫。噉我哋有冇問題？頭先已經解釋咗依三個碩士嘅學位嘅資料啦。

209
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,990
咁而家我哋就係入翻落去條條例嗰度。

210
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,460
啊！

211
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,790

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,090
喺我哋嗰啲文件裏邊有嘅。

215
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:33,330
