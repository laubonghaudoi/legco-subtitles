O.K.誒，我哋請花旗全球金融亞洲有限公司嘅代表程碧輝先生首先發言，好嘛？你有四分鐘，唔該你，程生。誒，大家好，誒，主席好，誒，多謝委員會邀請我哋花旗集團出席今日呢個咁重要嘅會議。首先，誒，作為香港。

45
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:17,950
金融市場嘅一份子，我哋花旗集團非常支持金管局同埋證監會嘅香港場外衍生工具市場改革嘅建議。相信大家都記得金融海嘯對銀行體係嘅衝擊，以及近年嚟國際監管水平。

46
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,530
嘅提升，花旗集團會全全力協助草委會。

47
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,080
監管局同證監會去制定適當同適度嘅監管架構。

48
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:39,540
以增強香港場外衍生工具市場嘅穩定性同埋流動性。最後，我哋花旗集團希望。

49
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:53,850
草案委員會可以成功通過證券及期貨修訂條例草案，令到香港嘅金融中心領導優勢可以一路延續落去。多謝大家。好啊，唔該曬嚇。

50
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,140
呃。

51
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:06,990
程先生嘅其他嘅意見咧，都已經係畀咗意見書我哋㗎啦嚇，噉啊，大家亦都可以睇我哋嘅文件嚇。下一位咧係魏可琪女士。

52
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:27,830
大家好，主席好。誒，好多謝委員會邀請花旗銀行參加今日呢個會議。我好認同剛才程碧輝先生所講嘅説話。花旗集團好支持政府就規管場外衍生工具市場而立法。花旗集團對證券及期貨修訂條條例草案嘅意見已經透過。

53
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:34,790
高偉新律師事務所九月十九日嘅信件遞交到委員會，我哋現階段冇額外嘅補充。

54
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,840
但係最後，我哋想再次多謝政府、金管局、證監會以及委員會，畀機會花旗銀行集團。

55
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,840
與呢個參與呢個香港金融市場咁重要嘅規管改革，多謝各位。好啊，唔該曬。

56
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,950
我哋下一位請香港財經分析師學會前任會長。

57
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,560
詹偉基先生。

58
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,070
係。

59
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:19,710
The Hong Kong Society of Financial Analysts is supportive to the new provisions regarding the reporting, clearing and trading applications. Having that said, we also emphasised we have to have a balance between the practical and the implementation.

60
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:39,720
Of which we believe that the implementation transitional time should be reasonable in view of the infrastructure building. And in that sense, we also suggest to have a pilot scheme with the large corporation before the official implementation.

61
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,400
We also.

62
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,190
thing that the

63
00:08:44,470 --> 00:09:04,480
The bill should not only looking at the product class, but also the underlying securities, given the complexity of the transaction. And on top of that, we welcome the central counterpart clearing establishment, but we also want

64
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,300
要highlight that the nature of derivatives.

65
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:28,590
basically make it difficult to transact all of them in the in the exchange. So in that case, we believe we have to look at the flexibility whether the centralised counterparty facility will be able to support the multiple.

66
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:43,340
all value transaction of the OTC derivatives. So we are supportive to the bill in general. Thank you so much, chairman.好，唔該曬。下一位係高偉新律師行嘅合夥人範愛華先生，範生。

67
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:56,920
Thank you for inviting us to the meeting today. I'm presenting on behalf of a group of international financial institutions, all of whom are interested stakeholders in the Hong Kong financial markets and are dedicated to Hong Kong's success.

68
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:12,940
The group is committed to helping the Bills Committee, the HKMA and the SFC develop an appropriate and proportionate regulatory framework that enhances the stability and liquidity of the OTC derivatives market and maintains Hong Kong's status as a premier international financial centre.

69
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,060
There are three key messages I would like to deliver on behalf of the group today.

70
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:25,080
第一是，的，重要性，的，兩階段，過程，

71
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:38,920
第二是，對香港發展一個國際上與其他主要司法管轄區相協調的規管機制的重要性；第三是，對持續的對話和市場諮詢在規管制定過程中的重要性。

72
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,110
Starting with the first point.

73
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:56,220
The group fully supports the two-stage process provided for under the bill, which lays down a broad regulatory framework and empowers the HKMA and SFC to create detailed rules for the mandatory obligations in the form of subsidiary legislation.

74
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:05,910
The approach is consistent with the approach that has been adopted in various other jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, Singapore and Australia.

75
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:18,810
Following the Financial Stability Board report published this month, we expect that Hong Kong will be keen to adopt legislation promptly to comply with its G20 commitments, and the group is very supportive of helping Hong Kong to do this.

76
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:30,640
Second, allowing detailed rules to be set out at the subsidiary legislation level will facilitate international alignment of Hong Kong's rules with those of other jurisdictions.

77
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:42,420
This is because it will allow the HKMA and the SFC to continue their active dialogue with other international regulators, of which they are a key part, in order to implement rules which are internationally consistent.

78
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:53,840
The importance of international alignment is recognised by the G20 and international regulators, and we strongly encourage the continuing efforts by HKMA and SFC to achieve this.

79
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:10,770
Conflicting, duplicative or inconsistent rules for trading derivatives as between Hong Kong and other jurisdictions could result in the restricting of the ability of Hong Kong and foreign market participants to enter into OTC derivative transactions with each other.

80
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,100
或可使香港不競爭國際上，通過 inefficiencies or unnecessary costs or barriers。

81
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:28,670
this would have serious ramifications for the liquidity and efficiency of the OTC derivatives market in Hong Kong, and could stifle the development of the REMIb derivatives market.

82
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:37,490
Furthermore, inconsistencies in the standards imposed could lead to needlessly onerous requirements for market participants faced with multiple regulatory standards.

83
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,830
this could hamper the ability of Hong Kong corporations to carry out hedging activity, which is vital for the appropriate risk management of their businesses in Asia Pacific.

84
00:12:47,650 --> 00:13:01,420
In order to achieve international alignment, the group strongly supports the HKMA and SSC developing an appropriate and proportionate scope for Hong Kong's OTC derivatives regulations and a recognition process for equivalent foreign regulatory regimes.

85
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:14,210
Reciprocal access and recognition will be key to ensuring that Hong Kong's regulatory framework for OTC derivatives is consistent with that of other jurisdictions, so that Hong Kong's financial markets can continue to thrive.

86
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:34,970
finally, as the detailed rules under many jurisdictions are still in the process of development, we urge the HKMA and SFC to remain flexible and to conduct regular market consultations with stakeholders who will be happy to assist during the rulemaking process in order to ensure that unnecessary disruption of the Hong Kong market is avoided, and so that Hong Kong can have the best.

87
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,160
Rules for the continued stability and success of Hong Kong's markets. Thank you.

88
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
唔該曬。

89
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,150
第一位係公民黨嘅李浩然先生。

90
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:55,830
主席，鑑於零八年金融海嘯暴露咗場外衍生工具市場嘅結構性問題，公民黨係絕對認同當局加強對相關產品作出更加多嘅監管。

91
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:16,120
今次嘅修訂主要嘅範本係嚟自美國嘅多德·法克華爾加改革與消費者保障法，同埋歐盟嘅歐洲市場基礎設施條例。共通點都係希望增加衍生工具市場嘅透明度，加強監管，以至將金融危機爆發時候嘅市場傷害性減到最細。具體嚟講，

92
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:34,450
條例草案會引入強制性匯報、結算同交易責任，而當局亦都表明，現階段只係會將只會涵蓋若干類別嘅利率調期，以及不交收外匯遠期合約。日後經過諮詢之後，先決定會唔會改考慮擴大法例嘅涵蓋範圍。

93
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:54,740
將其他類別嘅場外衍生工具交易納入其中，公民黨係大致認同依方面嘅安排。咁但係另一方面，草案對於點樣保障包括個人同機構投資者嘅篇幅係相對含糊，只係提出為場外衍生工具交易嘅中介人設立一個發牌嘅制度，去加強對投資者嘅保。

94
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:14,750
保障，公民黨係對此一定嘅憂慮，因為大家都知金融市場嘅產品係五花八門、變化萬千，我哋好難排除日後呢啲場外衍生工具會大眾化，成為可能你同我，甚至乎係街上面嘅公公婆婆都係接觸嘅一啲投資工具。佢嘅複雜程度亦都唔係我哋可能用短短幾分鐘嘅。

95
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:24,030
時間就可以完全理解同埋加以消化。難道當局係希望用一個消極嘅態度，等可能另一個雷曼嘅債券爆發先加以處理？

96
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:44,320
美國嘅多德法蘭克華爾街改革《要消費者保護法》嘅附例九《Investor Protection and Improvement to the Regulation of Security》裏邊嘅Subtitle A好清楚講明，任何嘅投資產品，包括衍生工具嘅銷售一方，必須要喺銷售嘅過程裏邊向投資者好清楚。

97
00:15:44,320 --> 00:16:02,430
解釋當中涉及嘅風險、cost同埋監管時候會唔會存在有任何嘅利益衝突問題，並要將呢個對話係過程係作為作出一個記錄。另外，亦都容許監管當局係用隨機嘅方式向投資者做一個投資者測試，去保障投資者嘅利益。

98
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:16,580
政府會唔會考慮將上述嘅相關扶例嘅做法套用喺香港，令到香港嘅金融市場可以繼續咁發展之餘，亦都同時間保障市民大眾嘅利益咧？多謝主席。好啊，唔該曬。

99
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,210
一位係CMI Group嘅律師Mister Timothy Low。

100
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,530
On behalf of CME Group, I would like to thank the Bills Committee on the Securities and Futures Amendment Bill for the opportunity to speak.

101
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:40,010
SEMI Group would like to take the opportunity today to speak about two matters. The first being the absence of transitional and equivalency provisions in respect of new ATS authorisation requirements and the new mandatory clearing and trading requirements.

102
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:49,370
我會講更多關於這件事，但CME集團擔心，作為現時草擬的法案，可能會對香港的風險管理工具的可用性產生令人不安的影響。

103
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,080
第二個問題，The Semi Group would like to speak about is the statutory insolvency protections.

104
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,540
statutory insolvency protection is important both to users and operators of clearing systems because it provides simple certainty.

105
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:09,360
在無上述保護，運營商和使用者的清算系統必須依賴一套複雜且不斷演變的普通法原則。

106
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:22,770
The bill recognises the need for simple certainty and extends statutory insolvency protection to certain clearing systems for OTC derivatives. However, it extends statutory insolvency protection only to a subset of clearing systems.

107
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:30,730
清ing系統以 form of ATS must be designated, and furthermore must be specified by by the SFC to benefit from this protection.

108
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:45,250
All clearing systems pose systemic risks and should benefit from statutory insolvency protection, even if they are not designated by the SFC as a CCP, and even if they have not been specified by the SFC as a designated CCP entitled to such protection.

109
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,230
我轉，然後到，了，沒有過渡性，和等價性條款。

110
00:17:51,580 --> 00:18:09,710
When the bill comes into operation, no one will be authorised to provide electronic trading and clearing services in respect of OTC derivatives. Similarly, after the bill comes into operation, no one will be designated to clear or trade classes of derivatives which over time may become subject to mandatory clearing or trading obligations.

111
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:17,320
The absence of transitional provisions means that no one can safely offer trading and clearing services in Hong Kong in respect of OTC derivatives.

112
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:32,730
anyone who carries on a business of offering such a service locally in Hong Kong runs the risk that that business will come to an end abruptly because the service in question is not authorised or designated at the time the authorisation requirement or a mandatory obligation comes into operation.

113
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,870
this is a real deterrent offering such services locally in Hong Kong.

114
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,280
separately.

115
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:49,170
The bill contains no provisions by which credible operators of trading and clearing systems outside of Hong Kong may be authorised as ATS or designated as CCPs in Hong Kong on a fast track basis.

116
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,770
such recognition is important because OTC derivatives trading occurs on a global cross-border basis.

117
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:03,410
第一，它不是可望可及的。

118
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:16,910
subjecting operators of trading and clearing systems to requirements in Hong Kong, different than those imposed internationally, discourages those operators from making their system available in Hong Kong, and discourages the use of Hong Kong as a trading and clearing centre.

119
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,160
secondly.

120
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:31,270
Fast track authorisation and designation will likely increase the number of trading and clearing systems available in Hong Kong. This in turn will mean more options for risk reduction at a lower cost, particularly for local Hong Kong financial intermediaries.

121
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,210
第三ly，fast-track authorisation and designation will reduce conflicts between requirements of different jurisdictions.

122
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:47,210
many of the organisations which have made submissions have already alluded to the risk of conflicting mandatory clearing and trading obligations in different jurisdictions.

123
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,050
Fast-track authorisation and designation will likely increase the number of global systems available to meet these mandatory obligations.

124
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:04,810
this in turn will decrease the risk that traders will be unable to meet mandatory obligations, because these obligations require clearing or trading through different systems in different jurisdictions.

125
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,350
Thank you very much.

126
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:14,470
下一位係香港財資經紀商協會嘅代表，誒張少成先生。

127
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:26,260
哦，謝謝你邀請我們來到這裡。我們只有一個非常小的點要講，我們基本上支持這個法案。我們認為香港應該規管衍生品。

128
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:42,950
But but little problem we have got is the choice of derivative under the present net the choice is very very wide it covers all derivatives. We feel that certain derivatives are not suitable to be traded on a central exchange.

129
00:20:43,270 --> 00:21:03,280
Unfortunately, one of the thing that one of the product that is put on first is the NDF. Now, NDF trading is not just a derivative. NDF trading is basically trading in currencies that have got exchange control. This is very politically sensitive currencies, and we feel that this is not suitable.

130
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,130
要被 traded on the central exchange.

131
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,280
I think that is the only point we need to make.

132
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,070
Okay. Thank you.

133
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,050
咁而家我哋請政府咧係。

134
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:33,660
作出初步嘅回應，好嘛？誒，殷主席，好啊！誒，多謝主席，亦即係好高興咧。今日能夠與市場嘅人士咧，同埋各個團體嚟到去交流意見。誒，實情咧，誒，我哋而家係修訂呢個證券及期貨條例，而嚟到落實去啊二十個站。

135
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:53,670
集團對於場外衍生交易工具呢一個誒規管咧，我頭先聽到咧，亦都係包括咧啊兩個監管機構喺過去兩年做嗰個公眾同埋市場諮詢嘅時候，我哋收到嘅意見咧都係一致嘅意思，即係話咧喺市場。

136
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:13,680
裏邊同埋外邊咧，都係贊成咧，香港係去立法咧，去跟從呢個二十國集團啊，對於場外衍生交易產品個規管呢個要求。噉我聽唔到一啲係好大嘅反對聲音，我甚至係聽到係有好大嘅共識喺呢一個啊課題上面。

137
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:33,880
呢個係第一點，我頭先聽到。第二點咧，就喺我哋個規範嗰個所謂啊點樣去做呢件事情，喺個本地立法點樣去最好去處理咧噉樣。噉我頭先都都聽到誒誒，亦都有之前咧，我哋係所謂用兩個層次呢個處理嘅方法。第一咧就係。

138
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:53,890
話大嘅原則，主要嘅框架咧，就應該喺我哋嘅主體法例嗰度去定立嘅。咁呢個咧就係我哋而家係諮詢諮詢啊啊，我哋嘅寵愛委員會嘅一個主要目的啦。當然，我哋都承認咧喺呢個規管呢個項目上面。

139
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:13,900
其實係一個幾大嘅工程嚟嘅噉樣啊，其中牽涉嘅技術性嘅細節係係好多嘅，有方方面面嘅。噉我哋都好高興聽到市場人士都願誒願意咧，就同監管機構喺我哋進行嗰個所謂附屬法例個誒定名嘅時候咧，都係會誒繼續去。

140
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,040
參與同埋畀你哋嘅意見。

141
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:36,660
頭先啊，有團體提出咧，希望誒喺誒定明呢一個去制定呢個附屬法例誒有關嘅詳情嘅時候咧，有充分嘅諮詢同埋誒有誒足夠嘅時間去吸納市場意見。我諗我依度可以連同金管局咧同埋證監會都可以作出呢一個承諾咧。

142
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:51,740
我哋喺誒進行呢個制定嗰個附屬法例啊，嚟去定定誒比較詳細嘅執行嘅規範嘅時候咧，會進行一個公眾諮詢，包括諮詢時長事件。咁呢個我係誒，我哋一定會做呢一步嘅。

143
00:23:52,050 --> 00:24:12,060
噉就誒，另外咧，亦都有意見咧。我哋就聽到話誒，希望亦都有適當嘅緩衝嘅時間啦，嚟方便市場去誒合規嘅。咁呢個亦都係我哋考慮嚟嘅。基本上，我哋喺即係喺立法嘅過程之中，我哋係誒希望。當然，我哋嘅立法會配合到。

144
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:32,070
好誒二十個集團以至嗰個財經穩定委員會嗰個要求啦，但係另一方面，我哋亦都係誒好關心業界喺嗰個合規嘅時候，會唔會係比較便捷咁可以合合到呢個規範，唔會造成一個好大你哋嘅合規嘅成本或者障礙。咁喺呢一個誒兩。

145
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:52,080
者之間，我哋希望取得個平衡。而家喺嗰個草案裡面，其中有包含嘅，譬如有過渡期啦，畀一啲申請牌照新嘅牌照嘅安排。我哋係會有過渡期。頭先有與會者講到，係咪希望有啲大型啲嘅誒金融機構首先做咗佢先咧？噉樣咁呢一方面咧。

146
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:12,090
啊！我可以講喺匯報方面咧，而家大致可以係噉樣做。誒金管局誒早前咧，亦都係要求咗一啲銀行啦，或者係誒嗰個認可機構咧，希望佢哋首先進行呢個匯報嘅工作，以致咧呢個係誒一方面可以有啲所謂嘅誒誒先導嘅性。

147
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:26,700
質啦，就希望知道誒呢一個即係喺實際上執行會唔會有誒碰到一啲問咩問題，亦都變咗我哋係誒早啲可以可以誒誒試到我哋即係心目中諗嘅方法係咪適用。

148
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:47,620
誒最後一點咧，就係關於嗰個誒，因為我想講埋呢一點咧，我都希望誒。關於技術上方面，特別係有誒團體啦誒誒關注到所謂嗰個自動化交易系統嗰個所謂誒嗰個承認啊，同埋同國際水平嗰個係咪一致咧？我希望一。

149
00:25:47,620 --> 00:26:05,760
陣間我哋邀請誒證監會同埋金管局嘅同同事就住呢個呢個誒課題同大家分享下意見。就我想講嘅咧，就係頭先誒誒議會者有提出，我哋其實亦都係好關注嘅所謂誒投資者保障嗰個角度。噉我估誒。

150
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:26,220
成個呢一個項目咧，誒，佢嘅出發點啊，絕對係保障投資者而嚟。但係可能誒喺個草案嗰度，大家睇唔到係個別投資者呢一個所謂誒嗰個層次。呢度有兩方面。第一，如果我哋係通過規管場外衍生啊產品。

151
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:46,230
佢嗰個交易，以致到咧，我哋有所規範，同埋個透明度都增加咧。呢一個一定係會啊，對於成個整體啊金融市場個風險個管理同埋控制咧，誒有所改善嘅。咁呢一個對於個別嘅投資者喺一個整體金融市場嗰度運作同埋參與咧，如果

152
00:26:46,230 --> 00:27:06,240
冇咗呢個呢個金融市場係出現好重大問題。首先，佢佢自己本身都受唔到保障，呢個係第一。第二，其實我哋係唔係話冇誒保障個別投資者喺喺呢啲啊，即係進行一啲投資者誒投資產品個零售銷售方面嘅保障，其實已經有。

153
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:26,250
有咗呢個條文喺嗰個誒證券同期期貨條例裏邊，佢呢啲誒誒條文誒包括，如果有投資產品，佢係會係推銷畀投資嘅大眾係邀約嚇誒畀投資大眾去參與咧，佢必須咧去到誒證監。

154
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:46,260
監會嗰度作出一啲啊誒誒啊authorisation，即係批批核嘅過程。呢個批核咧就係誒針對佢頭先啊誒有朋友提出咧，就係佢個風險嘅披露個披露嗰度咧係誒一定佢哋係要經過呢一個誒證監會去批准嘅而。

155
00:27:46,260 --> 00:28:06,270
而大家都記得近年，因為個金融個風暴以後咧，其實對於投資者產品喺無論係銀行或者係其他金融嘅機構去銷售咧，誒頭先講到所謂啊錄音啊，核實啊佢個風險啊嗰個水平同佢嗰個誒佢個投資者個人嗰個。

156
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:26,280
個誒資料啊，所謂認識你個誒誒客户嗰個咧係加強咗嘅，咁所以呢一方面咧，我哋就係誒冇放鬆到嘅。誒如果呢啲所謂場外衍生產品，佢通當然啦，而家我哋觀察到呢啲所謂場外衍生產品品咧，一般咧都係比基

157
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:46,290
購投資者係比較即係參與多嘅，絕大部分都係噉嘅情況。不過，如果啊呢啲所謂嘅投資者啊產品啦嚇場外嘅，佢一日咧誒係會向公眾發售嘅話咧，就會自動會受到我哋而家嘅誒條例去監管。咁或者誒。

158
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,850
呢個時間，如果主席容許我請啊。

159
00:28:49,130 --> 00:29:09,140
好啊！我哋請先請誒證監會阿雷生先做一個初步嘅回應，好嘛？就住團體代表嘅意見，好。誒，多謝主席，亦都多謝啊頭先啊業界嘅誒朋友咧，就提供一啲即係意見。咁其實就。

160
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,220
即係入邊提咗好多意見，咁其實總嘅嚟講咧，即係。

161
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:33,800
大家講嗰啲問題，我哋都有考慮過嘅。譬如話係啊，因為呢個場外衍生工具市場係一個國際性市場咧，所以我哋都好關注咧。香港作為一個國際金融中心咧，我哋定嘅法規咧，嗰啲條文咧，係可以係同國際係接軌嘅。咁雖然國際上目前都有唔同。

162
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:53,810
嘅啊啊法規咧，尤其是美國或者歐洲咧，其實都唔係話完全一樣嘅。噉我香港咧，即係啊喺方面咧，其實我哋都係即係放好多啊啊注意咧，去了解咧喺香港點樣做一個平衡咧，令到喺即係亞洲地區嘅金融啊機構咧，其實可以係滿足一啲啊。

163
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,400
國際上嘅規則咧，噉樣。

164
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,430
咁另外咧就係啊，頭先講到一啲啊啊投資者保護嗰度咧，噉我亦都覺得咧就係。

165
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:22,860
頭先等於啊啊Bureau嗰邊講咧，就係其實呢個產品其實主要一即係暫時而家咧就係主要喺啲誒機構性之間嘅誒交易嚟嘅。咁當然，如果呢啲產品有一日係變成一種係零售式嘅咧，咁其實香港而家已經有一套咧就啊管理一隻零售，即係話喺向一般零售客户推。

166
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,080
推銷一啲衍生產品啊，各方面咧，其實有一套好嚴格嘅規定。

167
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:36,560
尤其是係即係喺一個利民事件之後，所以就話呢方面係我哋係唔缺少嘅，即係同外國咧係可以話看得齊嘅。

168
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,020
咁至於有啲誒。

169
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:58,660
啊！業界人啊提提議咧，就係話啊，即係應該畀一啲時間個啊啊市場咧去準備。噉我一定會即係啊將呢個即係問題係係係keep in view嘅。因為如果個市場唔唔準備好嘅話咧，其實我係推出去亦都係好難去做到嘅我想要嘅嘢。

170
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:19,720
好啊，金管局誒李達志先生有冇啲咩回應？李達志就會好快咁補充兩句，都係個投資者保障嗰度，其實誒，即係我哋同頭先與會者提到美國嗰個doc friend嗰度誒，係有一個保障。不過我哋同美國嗰個法例只係個配置不同誒，因為我哋今次咧只係處理呢一個，好似係一個。

171
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:39,730
個誒誒批發層面一個大户嗰個層面，咁而零售嗰個層面咧，其實我響其他嘅規則啊嗰啲，其實已經係有提供，所以唔代表我哋係冇呢方面嘅嘅法例。不過今一次咧係唔需要處理咁解嘅啫。咁誒另外就提一提，頭先有提到話係同外國個監管機構嗰度，即係需要有一個配合。

172
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:59,740
合啊等等，我哋都明白呢個重要性，所以誒證監會同埋我哋咧，其實過去咧亦都有同誒外國一啲主要市場嘅監管機構咧溝通。噉我哋希望咧，亦都係儘量希望喺我哋依個實施嗰度咧，係誒對業界嚟講咧係一個比較誒順暢啦，同埋咧係儘量減少有一啲衝突嗰個安排嘅。

173
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,150
咁呢個我哋亦都繼續會同業界嘅溝通，多謝主席。好啊，唔該曬。

174
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:09,090
啊！各位同事對於團體發表嘅意見，大家有冇啲咩問題想？

175
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:29,380
誒同呢個團體嘅代表作交流嘅咧，有冇啊？梁繼昌議員啊，Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ah, many of the participants mentioned about the importance of alignment of this piece of legislation with international requirement. I just want to have a more detailed picture of the.

176
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:40,770
statement. In your view, can you tell me whether you think this piece of legislation has been in line with international requirement, or if not, then in what

177
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:51,980
特定Areas，你認為條Bill需要變動，以配合歐盟或美國的規定嗎？邊一位你想問嘅？

178
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,470
如果冇邊一位特別想指定嘅，或者在座嘅朋友有邊一位想回應？

179
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,710
楊繼昌議員呢一個問題嘅咧。

180
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,170
好。

181
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,240
嗯，Mr. Francis Evans。

182
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:26,540
Sure, thank you, Mr. Lung. In in our view, the the bill is consistent with international standards at present. It presents a a framework bill which represents a lot of work that the SFC and HKMA have done with the market and international regulators. So.

183
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:46,550
所以，未來的補助立法會被通過SFC和HKMA，我們預期會有類似水平的市場諮詢和考慮國際市場。所以，我的理解是，市場並沒有在這個階段擔心SFC和政府會通過。

184
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,630
appropriate substitute legislation for international alignment.

185
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:11,010
啊，好，兩位講完。主席，我有條跟進問題，想問一問啊啊局方嘅嚇。主席，誒，我想誒局方可唔可以解釋下誒喺呢個表入邊咧就有啲新嘅拉新性requirement，你可唔可以講一講即係呢啲新嘅拉新性requirement會係啲邊種類嘅牌，同埋大概啲乜嘢？

186
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,400
嘅requirement啊，好唔該。

187
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,700
邊一位上答啊，殷小姐。

188
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,780
誒。

189
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:38,840
誒就住呢一個即係誒新增嘅場外即係衍生教育工具個誒規範咧啊，喺證監會就係提議有兩個新嘅牌照嘅，就係誒第十一類嘅受規管活動咧，即係話咧就住場外衍生。

190
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,230
啊谷啊！

191
00:34:40,640 --> 00:35:00,650
工具產品佢個交易，或即係佢個產品去提供意見，噉就係誒誒呢個咧就係誒所謂advising誒and dealing嗰個嗰個意思啊。咁第二個咧就係誒嗰個誒第十二類個規管活動咧。

192
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:20,720
就係嗰個結算啦，就係嗰個誒clearing agent嗰個嗰個誒服務。噉就係如果佢係做一個誒結算代理服務咧，即係場外衍生交易工具通誒透過嗰個誒中央對手方去提供呢個結算服務咧，啊咁咧佢就係會啊需。

193
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:40,730
要誒申領新嘅牌照嘅，咁呢個係主要兩個新嘅誒牌照會係誒衍生出嚟。誒，但係誒，因為誒而家喺證監會裏面有誒兩類嘅牌照咧，因為我哋將誒嗰個O T C依啲誒產品納入之後咧。

194
00:35:40,730 --> 00:36:00,740
佢可能係需要擴闊佢而家提供嘅服務。如果佢冇做到咧，可能係誒會受到一啲誒影響。咁所以我哋希望誒唔係新嘅牌照，但係會擴闊佢嘅範圍嘅咧。呢兩個就係包括第七類嗰個所謂自動化交易服務個，即係話A T S嗰個定義啦。

195
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:10,690
因為而家所謂ATS咧就係未包括佢去進行嗰個利用呢個平台去進行即係所謂OTC嘅產品嘅交易嘅嘅。

196
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:30,980
事情啦。第二個會擴大佢個誒受規管活動嘅咧，就係第第九類啊，就係就係提供呢個資產管理，即係asset management嗰方面嘅啊情況。誒，我啊個建議就係同時都係話擴闊呢一個牌照，以至到佢都可以行擴。

197
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:42,670
愛到啊，場外衍生啊工具呢一啲誒，如果有國有關嘅投資組合，佢需要管理咧，佢都係要受呢個廣闊嘅牌照嘅，或者我睇下啊。

198
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,410
好啦，睇下邊一位有補充啊！

199
00:36:48,210 --> 00:37:08,220
誒梁生，其實頭先誒阿欣小姐都簡單介紹過，或者我我深入啲講多少少啦。第十一類嗰個受規管活動，我哋提議誒加入去嘅咧，就主要就係即係希望咧規管一啲將來從事誒中介活動嘅嘅經經紀公司啦。咁如果佢係向客户提供

200
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:28,230
一啲場內衍生工具嘅交易嘅服務嘅時候咧，就需要我哋攞個牌照。咁呢個牌照咧，其實咧就同現時咧證券同埋期貨咧第一類同第二類嘅牌照咧係相約嘅。咁即係而家我哋嘅證券及期貨條例裏邊咧，就正係可以規管一啲從事證券或者誒期貨合約嗰個。

201
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:48,240
交易嗰個誒活動嘅嘅規管啦。咁將來我哋就引入第十一類咧，就涵蓋埋場內衍生工具啦。咁第十二類咧係新嘅，就係一個結算嘅，因為誒我哋嗰個誒場內衍生工具嘅改革裏邊咧，其中一個重要課題咧就係引入一個誒強制性嘅結算安排，即係話要求咧所有一啲。

202
00:37:48,240 --> 00:38:08,250
啲誒，我哋指定嘅場內衍生工具交易咧，都放落去一個結算所度做結算嘅。咁所以中間嘅過程裏邊咧，就可能有需要涉及到一啲金融機構咧提供一個結算服務。噉我哋覺得，如果金融機構提供結算服務嘅時候咧，佢會涉及到咧處理客户嘅資產啦，同埋佢嗰個誒水平嘅問題。咁所以我哋亦都建議咧。

203
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:15,260
新新加入第十二類個牌照，咁誒七同舊咧，頭先啊，殷小姐都解釋過啦，噉我再再唔重複啦，嚇。

204
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:35,620
兩月仲有冇跟住啊一條問題嘅，其實我都擔心，有少少擔心就係話咧。本來S F O啦嚇，十幾年前開誒開始即係實行嘅時候，都係九種牌照、八種或者係我唔記得咗啦，大概八九種到啦。咁而家新增到十二種啦。咁但係我我覺得，如果你哋再將來再繼續將嗰個。

205
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:55,630
規管嘅範圍喺度擴大嘅時候咧，我就覺得會唔會即係將來你可能即係end up會有十六七種牌照，而每一種嘅只係可以容許嗰個即係持牌人做一啲好窄範圍嘅活動。即係我睇到呢個趨勢咯。其實對我哋，比如一啲中小企嘅嘅嘅持牌。

206
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:15,640
誒，其實就唔係話太太過有利，因為你可能要一攞咧，攞五六種牌照。咁究竟你用乜嘢嘅誒準則係誒去定定？究竟嗱，我可能要將而家誒現有嘅一啲牌照嘅活動係擴大佢，可能佢要考牌嘅時候考多寫少嘢啦，亦或？

207
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:23,960
你幾時會係認為咧係要即係發多一類新嘅牌照咧？究竟用咩準則嚟嚟決定呢樣嘢咧？主席，唔該。

208
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,630
我。

209
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,810
啊，雷生。

210
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:41,850
亦其其實即係頭先梁生講啊，即係由證券即係啊條例喺零三年嗰時成立咧，其實主要九類嘅。咁嗰類九類咧係好多年嚟咧都係一般即係證券期貨市場咧係。

211
00:39:42,130 --> 00:40:02,140
一般係啱用嘅，OK涵蓋啦。咁其實後來加咧，第十、十、十一、十二咧，其實主要咧就係因為誒零八年嘅金融風暴之後咧，其實全球咧即係係再去即係睇睇個監管架構仲有冇問題嘅，即係從嗰個角度。所以我哋後來咧就係九咧變成咧係監管一啲咧係一啲。

212
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:22,150
啲啊，我哋叫做credit rating agency，就係嗰啲啊，即係啊信貸評估嘅機構。咁嗰啲公司即係嗰啲啊agency。咁其實嗰啲唔係一般嘅人係即係一般嘅即係啊市場嘅人去做嘅，佢好好特殊嘅一個啊機構去做呢啲嘅。咁至於呢個十一十二。

213
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:42,160
咧，其實頭先我哋都講咧，其實主要係針對一啲比較大型嘅啊金融機構咧，係係需要用呢啲工具去處理佢嘅業務嘅。咁至於香港，譬如話嚟講，一般其唔係淨係香港其他市場咧，如果係中小企啊經紀或者係啊基金經理咧，其實佢即係未必係需要到咧係做。

214
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,820
即係十一或者十二嘅，嗰啲亦都係一種比較特殊啲嘅。只不過有一個系統風險方面咧，其實我哋覺得係值得監管佢嘅。

215
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,730
呢個係市場嘅需要，李慧瓊議員。

216
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:02,290
係主席，誒首先歡迎誒團體嘅代表今日嚟表達意見啦。噉我聽到大家嘅意見，整體嚟講咧都係歡迎。

217
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:22,580
誒立法嘅，亦都歡迎香港喺呢個部分咧與世界接軌。我想問一問咧，就係誒今日咁多團體嚟啦，誒咁頭先聽大家回答議員嘅提問嘅時候咧，基本上都係誒認同而家個立法方向嘅。你哋如果第時真係喺立法會呢個法例通過，其實喺實施細節上咧。

218
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:33,310
你哋有冇咩特別嘅要求，或者見到嘅困難，希望財經及服務局留意到，或者係證監會都知悉。噉啊，希望喺將來實施嘅時候咧，係更加暢順嘅咧。

219
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,340
有冇有冇團體可以回答一下咧？

220
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:44,780
有冇邊一位可以啊提出一啲問題？剛才佢哋發表意見嘅時候都提咗一啲。

221
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:58,710
誒，即係佢哋所要求嘅嘢，就我相信日後咧就誒政府亦都會就住個附屬法例嗰處咧，係同大家去具體噉樣去商討嘅。啊，有冇邊一位喺現階段可以回應？

222
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,570
我，誒，尖沙。

223
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,640
好啊！誒，法例本身咧就個。

224
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:26,940
大嘅框架冇乜問題嘅，嗰個地我哋都係擔心，業界都係擔心咧，在落實嗰陣時咧有幾樣嘢。第一樣嘢咧就係嗰個成本啊，因為咧就牽涉咗好多系統嘅嘢啦，咁所以我哋有建議就話會唔會畀啲大銀行或者係大嘅企業做咗？噉啊，金管局已經係頭先回應咗，即係你哋回應。

225
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:46,950
咗就有做嘅噉，我諗成本嗰度要睇翻咧，因為去到尾誒誒所有金融嘅交易咧，基本上未必一定要喺香港做嘅。咁如果成本太高咧，可以唔做嘅。咁第二樣嘢，我哋注意到咧，就係誒其實咧，就因為香港咧好多時咧，我哋做交易咧未必係用香港。

226
00:42:46,950 --> 00:43:06,960
嚟做嗰個誒所謂booking entity啊，咁咧好多時我哋要誒啲誒金融機構去申報佢哋所謂嗰個面對客户嘅交易嘅單位咧，喺呢方面咧係可能會我哋會覺得會有一啲誒難度喺裏邊嘅，即係話。

227
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:26,970
金融當局點樣可以真係確保佢哋真係如實咁申報佢哋交易嘅單位咧？噉樣咁呢一方面亦都係需要即係同業界合作，睇下點樣可以誒做得好啲嚇。咁另外一樣嘢咧，頭先亦都有誒團長提到咧，有一啲衍生工具咧未必適合喺嗰。

228
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:46,980
個啊誒交易所交易嘅噉，頭先提到一個就係嗰個啊非誒NDF啊嚇，即係不交割嘅誒遠期合約啦嚇。噉我哋亦都注意到咧，就誒喺規管嗰個長個交易誒工衍生工具嗰度咧，嗰個複雜性係相當大。咁咧，我哋

229
00:43:46,980 --> 00:44:06,990
要睇睇就話，如果你真係要涵括好多類型嘅誒衍生工具嘅話咧，我亦都相信要同業界傾一傾啦。可能亦都係需要分階段去執行呢一樣嘢，以致到咧誒我哋可以喺誒成本方面嘅控制啦。咁同時咧誒，亦都可以維持香港嘅競爭力。

230
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,810
噉我個回應係咁多。好，阿阿盧生，盧生。

231
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:35,080
One of the concerns is that we don't have any subsidiary legislation, and so we have framework legislation right now. But we don't have any idea what is going to happen. I think that there's some consultation discussion about what will happen with the subsidiary legislation, but there is considerable amount of uncertainty because we actually don't know how.

232
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:55,090
The provisions will be enacted or introduced by the SFC down the line. So, for many of the concerns which I think many of the organisations today which have been submitting, it's not clear how those will be resolved. So, for example, with CME Group transitional and equivalency provisions, those may or may not be incorporated into subsidiary legislation, and the concern would be.

233
00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:04,240
Are they and if they are, how are they done? There's no guidance given in the legislation whatsoever as to how any of these are done. In relation to

234
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:24,530
alignment with international regulatory initiatives again. There's discussion from the regulators that this will be done in an internationally consistent way, and there's nothing in the legislation right now which is inconsistent with international regulation. But then again, there's nothing in the legislation which is specifically consistent with international regulation either. We just don't have the details.

235
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:32,970
and I think that many organisations probably have the same concern, which is that there's a lot of uncertainty with this bill being passed with just framework legislation in place.

236
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:49,740
李源有冇補充？我我想聽下局方嘅回應，就住業界嗰啲關注點。好啊，局方可唔可以再詳細啲講？因為大家都覺得咧，未有嗰個附屬法例，咁所以咧都未知道將來會係點樣去執行呢啲。

237
00:45:50,020 --> 00:46:10,030
誒法例啊！你哋幾時會開始嗰個諮詢工作咧？係多謝主席，亦都多謝頭先嘅預見啦。我相信呢個係誒成立嘅，即係話誒業界好希望知道多啲詳細嘅資料咧，或者係運作嘅細節，以致到你哋可以知道咧，究竟即係將來係點樣去啊執行呢個。

238
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:30,040
即係要求啦，或者同國際嗰個要求係咪一致啊？我哋亦都完全係理解咧。我哋亦都關注，如果我哋所定立個要求同埋法例咧，同其他嘅管轄區咧，佢有啊唔一致性嘅地方咧，誒或者係重複啊，有好多重複嘅要求，對於業界係造成困難。

239
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:50,050
呢個係係我哋都理解，同埋亦都係特別關注嘅。咁所以咧，我哋希望咧就誒監管誒兩位誒機構方面咧，可以喺今個年底之前咧，將一啲附屬法例咧推出嚟咧，畀啊大家咧去做一個諮詢啊，同埋一個詳實嘅諮詢。噉啊～

240
00:46:50,050 --> 00:47:06,800
希望喺嗰陣時咧，亦都睇到啲細則。不過我諗可以強調就係話誒誒，我亦都誒鼓勵監管機構喺而家亦都開始咧，同大家開始可以去討論嘅將來嗰一套誒細則可以點樣寫係最好。噉就誒。

241
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:27,090
呢個咧就牽涉頭先有誒議會嘅誒誒同人咧，就係講到話誒將來嗰個合規嘅成本嗰個問題，大家都係關注嘅。咁呢個係無可否認，當誒有新嘅要求嘅時候咧，加諸喺大家身上咧，無可否認都係會有一啲誒成本嘅嘅嘅。

242
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:47,100
嘅增加，噉我哋就希望呢一個成本嘅增加係一個合理嘅範圍，同埋大家最緊要係實際上啊可可做得到。咁但係誒誒，我哋亦都留意到最近，譬如好似國際結算銀行，佢對於誒所謂嗰個做咗呢一個合規，成個全球嚟。

243
00:47:47,100 --> 00:48:07,110
嚟講咧，佢一個成本同所謂個得益嗰個即係誒最後嗰個結果係咩咧？究竟係做咗咁多嘢，究竟係大家純粹係做誒多咗成本，而個得益係少過我哋需要付出嘅啦？一或係我付出嘅將來個好處會多於我哋所所誒而家要投放嘅咧？

244
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,750
佢哋總體嘅結果咧，就認為。

245
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:30,040
對於全球嚟講咧，誒嗰個生產嘅總值係會有裨益嘅，會有啲好處嘅意思，即係話當誒大家誒因為呢啲誒嗰個要求喺你哋嗰個誒抵押品啊，或者你嗰個liquidity嗰啲流動性嘅資金上面，可能有啲誒誒要求同埋有得增。

246
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:46,660
增加誒嘅時候，令到業界有啲成本咧，但係對於成個金融嘅體係嘅運作同埋嗰個誒暢順咧，嗰個方面係誒會會更高嘅噉，所以佢佢認為咧就會係誒個好處係多於壞處噉。

247
00:48:46,940 --> 00:49:06,950
咁所以誒呢個對於香港自己競爭力嚟講咧，我哋就認為誒，因為呢個係一個全球嘅要求咧。如果我哋唔做，當然係會誒誒，對於我哋香港作為金融中心呢個係有影響。但係同時間，因為係大家去一齊去做呢件事咧，喺你哋同行。

248
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:24,650
之間嗰個所謂競爭性應該都唔會係啊，特別係香港誒處於不利嘅位置。我哋希望我哋個誒業界係同其他所有誒世界上其他區域嘅業界都係一提一同嘅線一同個水平上邊去競爭嘅。噉我諗或者誒。

249
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,340
好，有冇邊位想補充啊？

250
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:47,750
或者少少補充就係誒，都係關於話嗰個落實個細節嗰度咧。好似正如頭先啊，茵小姐講啦，我哋會再進一步諮詢啦。希望喺今年內。但係其實我哋喺諮詢推出諮詢之前咧，誒譬如今日業界提出咗或者佢寫咗入嚟嘅一啲意見咧，我哋都會喺我哋草擬嗰啲嘅附屬法例嗰陣時或者個諮詢嗰陣。

251
00:49:47,750 --> 00:50:07,760
事咧，我哋都會誒比較詳細考慮，同埋咧就誒喺過程之中咧，我哋都誒同一啲業界嘅代表啊，我哋都會保持一個聯繫，咁希望出到嚟嗰陣時咧，嗰個誒諮詢文件啊，或者嘅諮詢嘅法例咧，都大盡量將大家嗰個關注咧係已經係參考在內，咁當然再有進一步嘅意見，我哋會再考慮。好啊，政府。

252
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:25,830
我就提出咗咧，就今年年尾嚇就會誒進一步同大家商討個附屬法例嗰個問題。啊，咁所以咧就又帶有兩個月嘅時間咧，亦都歡迎大家咧係繼續發表意見，好嘛？啊，李慧瓊議員有冇冇跟進係嘛？陳建波議員。

253
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:36,960
係多謝主席。首先多謝各位出席者啦。咁今日出席者咧，大都支持呢個呢個新嘅法例。呢個比較少見嘅，因為咧一般經營者都係好抗拒呢啲監管。

254
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:57,250
咁誒，因為其實每一樣監管咧都有啲合規成本啊，com即係所謂compensate cost。咁其實我個人嚟講就係都係好擔心政府咧喺雷曼事件之後咧係過分監管香港金融制度，令到我哋咧係不再成為一個有競爭力嘅嘅市場。咁但係呢個法例有少少特別嘅，因為咧大家睇到咧係無論美國啊、歐盟啊、新加坡啊、澳洲都已經。

255
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:17,260
做晒，咁呢啲我哋主要對手都做咗咧，我相信都係點解大家係比較接受呢樣嘢啦。但係我都想問一問咧，即係除咗今日啲大公司嘅出席之後咧，嗰啲中小企其實係咪都係對呢樣嘢，即係細或者或者唔好叫中小企啊，比較細型啲嘅經營者有冇啲擔心係頭先冇講到咧？當然頭先大家講咗好多嘢。

256
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:37,270
即係譬如分啊，附屬法例啊，嗰嗰主要法例啊，同埋其他，你都會分階段，亦都有諮詢，啲似乎做得相當足嘅。但係我都想知道咧，其實係有冇啲即係或者中型嘅公司對有其他意見？你哋喺個過程有冇啲收到一啲誒反對嘅聲音？今日冇講到嘅，可唔可以同我哋講講咧？噉樣啊，如果係如果係。

257
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:57,280
係有嗰啲噉嘅誒反對嘅聲音，或者想佢更完善嘅聲音，你又點樣去處理佢咧？或者幫我哋講講呢樣嘢？唔該你。好啊，任小姐。係誒，多謝主席。我諗我哋誒喺做諮詢嘅時候咧，都誒，無論個規模係點樣，我哋都會關注嘅佢哋嗰啲誒誒訴求。咁誒誒，是。

258
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:17,290
實上係嘅，而家參與所謂從業衍生交易工具呢啲啊買賣或者係啊活動嘅咧，係係主要係大型啲嘅金融機構。咁但係誒唔代表我哋就唔唔注視，即係對於中小型嗰個啊金融機構嗰個影響。咁誒一般嚟講，我哋就唔唔係聽到。

259
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:37,300
好特別，即係誒有特別大嘅關注。主要咧就係誒合規嗰個成本啦。頭先我哋都講解釋過嗰個成本嗰個問題，希望我哋都關注呢一方面，儘量便利啦。第二咧就係申請牌照嘅時候，亦都係希望作出一啲便利嘅措施。咁因此，我哋就誒頭先講過啦，即係話。

260
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:57,310
誒係咪即係唔係都要開啲新嘅牌照嘅時候？誒要一個衡量嘅，即係話咧，你喺誒誒對業界造成影響，同埋你誒就住某個特定嘅範圍，佢有專業嘅要求之中咧，要有一啲平衡。即係話你而家如果現有嘅牌照已經可以容納得到。

261
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:17,320
新嘅活動咧，我諗，我諗相信監管機構都未必係誒一定係要誒設立一啲新嘅牌照，就喺現有嘅牌照嗰啲所謂受規管嘅活動未能夠涵蓋新嘅要受監管局嘅嘅情況嘅時候，先去考慮新嘅牌照。我諗呢個係我哋都會留意得到，唔係話誒即係。

262
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:37,330
無日無知誒，令到即係業界無所識，從太多新嘅要求，使咗新嘅牌照。咁呢度係誒曾經我哋誒誒收到啲意見，因此我哋採取個誒處理方法就話兩種就係新嘅。如果逼不得已，即係即係必須要開立嗰兩種十一十二就新嘅。但係如果而

263
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:57,340
而家已經有啲牌照，但係只係需要擴寬，適度嘅擴寬，我哋就吸納啲意見，就係第七類同埋第九類作出放寬個牌照，擴闊佢噉。咁呢個都係我哋吸納咗意見。當然就我哋誒喺呢一個過程之中，無論係個重案啦，或者將來嗰個附屬法例咧，我哋都會係繼續開放，希望。

264
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,360
就聽多啲意見。

265
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,070
真嘅。

266
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,120
冇跟進，我副主席。

267
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:23,060
誒，我都想講講個中小企咧，對於呢個法例咧嗰個感覺就係，因為好多產品咧就冇喺個交易所誒市場交易，所以佢哋嘅參與就少啲，對呢個法例咧嗰個誒嘅瞭解同埋要求就唔多嘅。不過我今日咧。

268
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:31,650
就好高人聽到所有嘅代表咧，都贊成咧，同意加強保障投資者嘅利益。呢個係我哋即係樂意見到嘅。

269
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:44,780
亦都誒提咗好多咁好嘅建議喺呢度，我都想問問咧，就根據有關嘅草案咧，當局咧獲得大量嘅利率調期同埋不交收延期嘅。

270
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,110
外匯嘅合約嘅市場嗰啲數據。

271
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:54,080
而呢啲數據咧，對市場嗰個動向咧，係好重要嘅參考嘅價值。

272
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:05,160
咁火口解釋有關當局喺處理呢啲有關數據嘅原則上，點樣保持嗰個披露信息係公平公正？

273
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,120
多謝。哦，殷小姐。

274
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:09,150
語言或者誒。

275
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:29,440
嗰個披露方面，我交畀啊金管局啊李生講講，不我就想話誒，至於頭先都議會姐有講過，即係誒嗰所謂特定嘅產品會納入規管範圍呢方面嘅事情咧，我哋都會有個諮詢嘅，即係話誒，而家我哋喺個草案上邊對於即係所謂嘅場外衍生產品呢個。

276
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:49,450
個定義係有嘅，但係呢個定義誒係闊少少嘅。咁但係日後我哋逐步逐步去推行嘅時候，邊一隻特定嘅產品會納入裡面咧？我哋會喺嗰個所謂附屬法例諮詢嘅時候一並諮詢市場。噉我諗呢個係大嘅我哋處理嘅方法，或者係呢個數據嘅誒發放方面。

277
00:55:49,450 --> 00:56:09,460
我請緊李生解答嚇。多謝主席。誒，響我同意啊，副主席講得好啱嘅嗰啲數據咧，尤其是個別一啲機構嗰啲嘅買賣嗰啲數據咧，係都係一啲誒市場會有敏感性嘅資料嚟嘅。咁其實誒誒，響呢一次今次我哋呢一個草案嗰個內容嗰度咧，呢啲。

278
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:29,470
數據咧係直接提交畀金管局啦，係金管局咧係管有依啲數據嘅。咁誒誒，眾所周知，其實金管局對於處理依啲敏感數據咧，誒，譬如單而家嘅銀行嘅數據咧，我哋都係非常之小心處理嘅。咁誒，有需要咧，我哋係因為其實國際上咧，而家對於依啲數據咧都有一定。

279
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:49,480
定嘅要求咧，就係要去誒有一定嘅透明度。誒噉，但係咧就喺個透明度之餘咧，我哋第一咧就係要希望做到依個誒公平公開咧，即係話去發放嗰陣時咧，唔會話有個別嘅誒市場人士咧係會早於其他人哋咧係得到呢一個數據咧，呢個我哋一定會會確保啦。

280
00:56:49,620 --> 00:57:02,420
咁亦都我哋嗰個誒公佈嗰個情況啊、個規限啊、個時間啊、內容等等咧，我哋亦都會係好適當地咧同市場溝通咗咧，然後我哋先至去做嘅。咁所以呢度我哋係會好小心噉樣去處理嘅。

281
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,320
有冇跟進？冇啦。

282
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,370
好啊！大家同事仲有冇其他問題？阿梁啟昌。

283
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:30,680
多謝主席啊！誒，我想問一問咧，特別就係第十二號牌個settlement system。首先第一條問題，我想問翻誒局方或者證監會咧，究竟而家現有喺嗰個誒bill入邊咧，呢個settlement system呢個牌照嘅資本要求同埋流動資金要求係會係幾多咧？同埋有冇？

284
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,910
其他嘅嘅要求啦嚇，唔該。好，證監會雷生可唔可以答下？

285
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:41,890
誒，即係十二號牌係即係嗰個結算嘅，係代客結算嘅，誒誒。

286
00:57:42,190 --> 00:58:02,200
清算咧，或者係誒誒嘅牌照嚟嘅。咁咧就係其實咧，就因為佢係一個受規管嘅誒誒活動咧，所以其實咧就係經營者咧，係將來咧係會有一定嘅誒，即係資本嘅要求嘅。咁而家我哋嗰個資本要求嗰個誒要求誒嗰個具體嘅細則咧，就會喺將來嗰十。

287
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:14,440
substantial regulation嗰度咧，我所謂將來有個叫做financial resources requirement嗰度咧，即係啊啊會定落嚟嘅。咁如果我定咗之後咧，亦都會諮詢市場，即係啊啊。

288
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:34,770
即係睇下佢有冇特別意見嘅哦，即係未有定喎，而家暫時你好。嗱，我頭先你亦都講過咧，就話呢一個結算系統，即係呢個牌咧，可能都係一啲大嘅金融機構係會係即係有興趣做嘅多數。我亦都想問一問個市場究竟，即係市場嘅participant會啊？

289
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:45,530
喜歡兩三個大嘅結算系統啊，抑或係好多個唔同嘅結算系統，抑或係一個結算系統獨大，你都冇所謂。我想知道市場嘅意見嚇，唔該。

290
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,930
好啊！邊一位？

291
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,070
有咩意見？

292
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:14,830
我相信都唔會太多，結算所啊，即係壟斷情況出現。好啊，詹生。好啊，誒，我哋按照翻誒而家香港個資本市場嗰個結算系統啦，就其實港幣我哋係用誒C M U嘅，咁咧基本上喺業界度咧嗰認受性係好高嘅。咁其實咧我哋關注咧就只係兩樣嘢嘅啫，第。

293
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:34,840
就係嗰個誒結算系統嗰個誒所謂信用成本啊，嗰個credit risk有幾高噉就話，如果係誒政府提供或者係誒真係畀外邊一啲誒機構去做嘅話咧，究竟呢一度係點樣去控制？咁第二咧就係使用呢個系統嗰陣時咧嗰個誒成本啦嚇，即係話咧我哋要畀幾多錢向呢個系統？

294
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:54,850
噉啊，一般業界嘅諗法咧都誒，即係即係我即係個人意見啦。嚇，呢個情況嚇，我哋都相信咧，就大家未必喜歡係過度分散，有太多呢啲系統嘅嚇。咁反而我哋就係根據頭先嗰兩個大嘅原則咧，去睇下即係落實嗰陣時係點樣去做咯。噉就我哋亦都會覺得係誒，大部分都係。

295
00:59:54,850 --> 01:00:14,860
即係會參與者嘅嘢，即係個系統嘅參參與者，噉就建構呢個系統同埋話去誒維護或者開發呢個系統咧，咁可能要睇睇誒究竟係畀業界去做啊，定係由誒中央即係由政府去做？噉我相信呢個要再一步討論。係，阿主席，我想問一問政府有冇？

296
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:32,560
既定政策，而家呢一個計算系統係咪其實呢個十二號牌係咪同畀畀畀CARS度身訂造啊？呢個你哋都中意，可能有兩個唔同嘅計算系統，亦或其實你心目中都係得即係CARS嘅咧，係咪？即係我我想問一問你哋嗰個政策考慮緊喺邊度啊？嚇！即係我想。

297
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:53,050
或者我想啊講講咧，就係其實十二號牌咧係係即係係相對咧，就係一個結算所嘅會員嚟嘅，即係佢唔係一個系統嚟嘅。即係邊個想做一個，譬如話你頭先啊楊議員講嗰個Secas，咁Secas就係一個結算CCP嘅，係結算所嚟嘅。咁咧結算所之間咧，佢又會招聘。

298
01:00:53,050 --> 01:01:13,060
一啲結算會員嘅，咁其實十二號牌咧就係邊個想做一啲結算所嘅會員，而佢係想服務佢啲客户咧，就要攞呢個牌啦。OK，等於而家seeker入邊嗰啲participants咧，佢啲members咧，佢就即係個代，即係類似噉樣嘅，即係佢係一種係服務性嘅。咁而seeker本身佢一個即係我哋叫。

299
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:31,260
C.C.P.即係中央交易對手咧，係另外咧證監會咧就係有權咧就去審批佢同埋去即係等佢成立嘅。咁嗰度會有有一個規則啦，喺個條例度咧係授權畀證監會同埋金融金啊金管局咧一齊咧去審批，按照一啲國際嘅標準咧去定一啲規則出嚟嘅。

300
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:51,720
咁即係你話呢個十二號牌就係settlement system嘅participant一排噉，但係邊個operate呢個成個system咧？而家嗱個嗱個system咧就係譬如話喺誒長棍醫生工具咁啦，咁咧就係當有個誒有個有個客，佢話想做一支誒。

301
01:01:51,820 --> 01:02:11,830
外匯啊，interest rate swap噉樣係嘛，即係即係啊，利率掉期。噉佢咧就係做咗之後，而呢只嘢咧，將來個要求咧話，你一定要即係啊，強迫性嘅要去交收嘅啊，去結算嘅。嗯。做完之後，咁咧呢個咁嗰個提供呢個服務嗰個即係啊，交易商咧佢。

302
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:31,840
就話OK，噉我去邊，即係去邊個結算所去結算呢個好咧？噉樣咁咧，將來咧個條例咧係容許佢有選擇嘅。嗯，有可以有一啲咧就喺香港，因為而家香港交易所咧佢成立一個OTC嘅caring啊service嘅，即係而家我哋係審批緊佢嘅。咁將來佢會成立呢個，噉佢會喺。

303
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:51,850
一個其中嘅選擇畀市場。咁另外咧，如果個即係嗰個誒券嗰個交易商咧，佢話啊，不如我想去，因為個客户需要咧，可以喺海外揾一個結算所去做嘅。噉我哋條例咧，亦都容許證監會咧去承認嗰啲海外嘅結算所，如果佢符合某啲國際嘅要求，噉。

304
01:02:51,850 --> 01:03:02,580
咁令到呢個啊攞十二號牌嘅人咧，可以代個客户咧喺海外去結算，亦都可以喺香港嘅結算。咁呢個係一個commercial嘅decision畀我哋揀嘅。

305
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,510
嗯。

306
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,330
誒，我仲有即係。

307
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:14,860
一個問題啊，主主席，誒就係比如一間普通嘅商業機構做一個OTC directive嘅時候。

308
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:33,810
佢可能一年係forhatching purpose，可能做唔係好多單四五單，佢係咪都係要即係強制性地要用呢一啲嘅嘅嘅計算系統去做咧？如果一間即係唔係金融機構，一啲一啲大嘅，譬如跨國公司做一啲OTC director嘅時候，啊唔該，我可以即係局方可唔可以答到我呢個問題？好啊。

309
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:54,200
嗰個誒大致或者一陣間證監會補充，大致就係如果佢係受規管嘅人士咧，即係包括即係誒證監會下邊持牌嘅人士，或者係誒金管局下邊啲銀行咧認可機構，佢做呢一啲場外衍生誒產品個嗰個交易嘅話咧，誒無論個水平如何。

310
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:14,210
我咧，佢都要接受所謂嘅匯報同埋嗰個結算嗰個要求喺度。咁但係，如果唔係呢啲所謂受規啊管嘅人士，但係佢又參與呢一啲啊活動嘅話咧，誒日後係會有定定一個水平嘅。即係如果佢超越或者觸及嗰個水平咧，就要誒都會。

311
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:34,220
需要受到呢一啲要求嘅規範嘅噉樣。咁當然咧，更高層次，我哋所謂有啊系統重要參與者，佢觸及一啲更高層次嘅啊水平嘅時候咧，佢亦淨係亦都要同監監管機構去登記誒，有適當嗰個即係啊監察噉樣樣。噉就有幾個層次喺度。

312
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:55,310
嗱，可唔可以講清楚咧？即係如果係做三兩單嘅啫，係咪都係要登記，都係要做？或者阿阿阿女士，女士，其實就係誒，即係佢呢度冇所謂，即係冇冇指明係一單或者係幾多單嘅。其實咧，譬如話喺結算方面咧，只要有一個有間大型嘅機構，佢需要呢啲產品去。

313
01:04:55,310 --> 01:05:08,250
即係誒去對沖佢自己嘅風險。佢同一個銀行做咗，而呢個個銀碼咧係超過某個水平咧，其實嗰個嗰個transaction咧就係需要咧去結算㗎啦。佢做一單都要啦，其實。

314
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:11,860
好啊。

315
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:31,390
好清楚啦，係嘛？OK，嗱，如果同事喺呢一方面冇其他意見咧，噉我就好多謝今日出席會議嘅團體同埋代表，好嘛？噉你哋可以而家就離場㗎啦。咁跟住落去咧，我哋就要處理我哋嘅法例嘅其他問題，好嘛？多謝多謝咁多位嚇。

316
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:57,010
嗱，跟住咧，我哋就要誒，即係睇睇大家同事咧，對於呢個法例咧，裏邊住有冇咩嘅政策性嘅問題係要釐清嘅，或者係技術性嘅問題係想發問嘅。啊，梁繼昌議員。

317
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:17,300
啊！再一次多謝主席。我想問一問局方，即係喺呢個標上邊咧個Part Five嗰個關於就市場失當行為，再行作出交出令嘅修訂。誒呢個咧就似乎同而家呢個即係O T C Directive嗰個即係總體方向嗰個標就唔係太大關係。就點解無端插嘅？同埋如果你？

318
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:35,690
你即係插咗呢幾段嘢入去嘅時候，可唔可以即係解釋下究竟你嘅修訂係係有啲乜嘢嘅嘅嘅後果咧？似乎都幾大嘅，即係幾嚴重嘅事情。又講埋呢個有組織嘅嚴重罪行條例嘅修訂，究竟係呢一個部分係係講啲乜嘢咧？唔該，局方。多謝，蔣小姐。

319
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,260
嗯，其實就誒。

320
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:53,460
誒呢個咧係一個即係我哋希望咧利用呢個機會，因為我哋啊呢啲修訂咧都係觸及即係證券及期貨條例啦。咁亦都係誒同我哋咧即係而家喺誒。

321
01:06:53,740 --> 01:07:01,440
如果即係誒其他嘅情況之下，誒犯咗呢啲例咧，誒佢可以咧就係誒誒。

322
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:21,730
啊！喺有組織及嚴重啊罪行條例下邊加入咗佢嘅話咧，係可以將佢嗰個誒即係得到個收入咧係啊充公嘅。但係咧，反而而家因為我哋市場失當行為，即使佢誒入咗罪啦，係成立咗嗰個罪行咧，咁但係因為

323
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:40,720
係而家未納入喺嗰個誒誒誒有組織及嚴重罪行條例裡面咧，以致咧法庭唔可以咧係將佢咧就係將佢誒所得嚟嗰個得益咧係誒作出一個沖攻，變咗咧噉就誒誒。

324
01:07:41,000 --> 01:08:01,010
對於嗰個阻嚇力，特別係我哋誒而家係非常關注誒嗰個所謂洗黑錢個罪案方面咧，嗰個有有個關注喺度。咁因此我哋希望誒利用呢一個機會咧，都係誒堵塞埋堵塞埋呢個漏洞啦。咁希望佢如果係因為誒市場失狀行為。

325
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:09,680
種種行為受啊而得到嘅唔應該得到嘅一啲啊利益嘅話咧，佢係可以被誒法庭去充公嘅嚇。

326
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:24,770
啊！主席，想澄清下，你所謂充公係咪只係限於係個市場失當行為所得到嘅利益，同埋呢一個即係有組織及嚴重罪行條例入邊有冇一個上限嘅咧？有冇cap嘅咧？咁個充公嘅嘅款項啊？

327
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,670
係有嘅，或者容許我誒。

328
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,680
在。

329
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,760
睇一睇嗰個相關。

330
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:51,940
嗯，或者容許我喺會後再誒提供呢個資料畀人，好嘛？我我哋呢個法例裏邊有有涵蓋到嘅，啊，好。

331
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,860
同事有冇其他問題啲？

332
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,380
副主席有冇咩名？

333
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:12,040
O.K.嗱，如果同事對呢條法例嗰個政策或者技術上冇咩其他問題咧，咁誒，我要同大家講講咧就。

334
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:30,180
