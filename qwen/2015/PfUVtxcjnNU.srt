1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:20,020
咁已經夠法定嘅人數，亦都剛剛到開會嘅時間啦。噉我宣佈，二零一二年印花税修訂條例草案委員會第三次會議咧就開始啦。咁以前嘅第一項咧就係確認通過會議紀要，二零一三年一月十八號嘅會。

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,520
自己要咧已經發畀委員，秘書處咧係冇。

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,550
冇收到任何委員作出修訂。

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,840
咁咧，我就想請委員確認會議紀要。

5
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,940
好啊！如果冇異議，我哋就確認啦。咁另外咧，就係跟進翻上一次有關個人金錢利益嘅披露。

6
00:00:40,820 --> 00:01:00,130
啊！我哋喺一月廿五號討論過相關嘅議題。咁上次咧係會議上提及咧，就以書面形式一次性嘅作利益申報。不過及後咧，法律顧問啊同埋啊秘書處咧都同我哋再商量過，因為佢哋澄清咗之後咧。

7
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:20,420
佢話：若然按議事規則第八十三條適用嘅情況咧，委員會有直接或者誒委員會委員有直接或者間接金錢利益嘅事而動議任何議案或修正案或就該事而發言咧，委員會咧係仍需作口頭披露。簡單嚟講咧，即係書面嘅申報咧，並不能取代。

8
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,050
內口頭嘅披露。

9
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:34,930
噉我已經向誒秘書處同埋法律顧問咧，就誒表達咗誒，起碼我當時諗到誒議員嘅一啲關注點，噉我哋誒。

10
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:42,590
秘書處亦都答應咧，將我哋嘅關注咧就轉交議事規則委員會。噉我理解咧，議事規則。

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,210
誒委員會啦，都知悉相關嘅情況，亦都會咧，就係會去討論嘅。

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:02:00,180
咁即係話咧，議員個人利益，誒，議員個人利益監察委員會咧，已經將議員按議事規則第八十三條A披露金錢事宜嘅利益咧。

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:20,500
係披露金錢事宜、利益嘅事宜咧，納入委員會嘅待議事項。咁故此咧，監察委員會未有結論之前咧，如果委員會咧就以二誒就就呢個事情發言係有直接或者間間接金錢利益嘅話咧，請委員會咧都係喺開會前咧就作事。

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,780
先申報，或者發言前咧作申報。

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:31,530
咁倘若委員唔肯定應否喺法案委員會會議上討論披露某項利益，我希望委員咧就盡量。

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:47,980
諮詢法律意見同埋作出判斷，噉啊請大家參閲以原個人利益監察委員會備議嘅立法會文件CMI-10-12-13號文件啊，好有好踴躍啦！誒，陶謹新議員。

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:03:09,050
誒，你每次開會之前，你問一問有冇人申報，冇人舉舉手就算啦，唔使冇人都要講啊，係嘛？真係好嘥時間，我覺得。我話呢個係你嘅建議，冇問題。我聽埋其他議員嘅講法先。陶錦新議員。誒，主席，誒，我因為上次啱啱有有件事撞咗會嚟唔到，但係我就係誒瞭解咧，係咪法律顧？

18
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:29,060
問嘅意思即係話咧，凡係誒擁有物業誒住宅啦嚇，都需要申報。噉我覺得呢個係好奇怪喎，即係我諗係咪如果你係誒有誒買入，但係又機會咧就係幾多誒誒限期內買？

19
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:49,070
即係短期內賣出噉樣啊，或者你係誒有誒打算係譬如係公司相關或者點樣，然後就賣出噉樣。但係如果你完全係自己住誒一路都持有，我就唔明點解真係會要申報？真係，我覺得呢個係錯誤嘅，即係呢個噉嘅理解。據我瞭解咧，法律顧問就。

20
00:03:49,070 --> 00:04:09,080
就冇嚇就住擁有物業咧，作出話需要與否嗰個申報嘅噉，純粹係議員嗰個判斷嘅啫，係嘛係咯。明白呢個你嘅誒誒分享啊，阿湯家華議員，你已經講咗，需唔需要再講？所以我就我簡單啲係你每次開會之前，你問一問邊個要申報，咪冚下舉手咪算咯。

21
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,720
好，石禮謙議員。

22
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,030
即係我係上一趟嘅新報，同埋而家嘅新報都係一樣㗎啦。

23
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:24,930
一樣啊，即係可係請你要申報咧，咁咪申報我上一趟申報嘅嘢咯。嚇，我建造地地產商會，我有物業嚇。

24
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:45,220
係啊，好，阿黃定光議員，阿你係監察議員監察個人利益委員會成員係嘛？唔係啊，唔係啊，你唔係啊，邊個係啊？可以都講解下。係啊，我我即係，不管點到咧，我覺得誒，即係按規定咧，如果要申報，我就申報。雖然我本人或者我公司咧，短期內咧就

25
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:53,500
未有物業買賣嘅計劃，但係亦都有噉嘅可能嚇，咁所以咧，我呢度作事先申報。好，劉慧卿議員。

26
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:13,810
個委，我係嗰個委員會成員啊，副主席啊，主席，你有咩有咩？你有咩嘢想講啊？主席，哦，我我就想請你盡快去誒討論呢件事啦。我哋上次建議咧，以書面申報取代每一次口頭申報，亦都進一步希望保障議員，免得佢有時出入會議嘅時候咧忘記發言。

27
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:33,820
前申報咁純粹係噉嘅，不過噉嘅建議會後咧都認為係並不恰當，噉啊請你哋委員會再作討論啦，好嘛？啊，主席，我哋而家會啦，即係最有效嘅咧就係秘書就通知嗰邊嘅秘書同埋啊葉國軒主席啦，係你貴黨嘅成員嚇，噉啊希望擺喺第下次開會議程咯。

28
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:53,830
但係我自己會覺得書面梗係唔得啦，主席。即係開會嘅時候，你每一次講嘢之前或者咩，你申報你嘅利益啊嘛。誒，頭先阿湯議員建議話你問一次舉手咧，嗰個當然可以，因為但係好多人都行出行入嘅，你問嗰陣時佢都唔喺度，噉就到時又話啊，你問過。

29
00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:13,840
我嚇，我冇講啊，又又拗一餐懵嘅，所以我覺得係嗰個透明度同個問責性好緊要。但係我我同意你講啦，我希望我哋秘書咧係同我哋另外個委員會秘書快啲講，叫阿葉國軒主席咪即係快啲開會，同埋你哋開會嘅時候，秘書處準備一份完備嘅資料畀我哋個委員會考慮啊！唔該，主席。

30
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:27,260
啊，劉慧卿議員，其實秘書處都已經誒轉達畀相關委員會嘅。噉啊，葉國興主席有啲咩高見咧？誒，未未討論到呢件事。噉我繼續請請議員發言先嚇，係啊啊啊，梁繼昌議員。

31
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:43,600
我申報翻我上次申報嘅利益。我諗請你係咪要重複翻咧嚇？我諗重複。誒，我係直接會參與呢個税務工作，亦都會直接參與印花税嘅工作，所以我即係係要申報呢樣嘢啊。誒，葉劉淑儀議員。

32
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,030
我我誒第一次嚟開呢個會嚇，啊！我申報我有物業，係噉。

33
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:59,970
係有冇其他議員就住阿田北俊議員？誒，主席，噉我再次申報啦，我係有從事地產嘅誒買賣嘅活動嘅。

34
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,160
係啊。

35
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,730
張宇仁議員，我申報我可能會買物業啊。

36
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,680
係。

37
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,210
姚思榮議員。

38
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
誒，係。

39
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:33,090
係誒，謝偉全議員，誒，主席，我申報我有物業之外咧，我亦都係有公司從事關於地產業務同埋買賣嘅事宜嘅嚇。係湯家華議員，你係咪舉一手？係啊，噉我如果要個申報申報咧，主席，我有物業，同埋我有機會接觸到即係誒買賣樓宇嘅官司。

40
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,900
胡志偉議員。誒主席，我只係申報我屋企人有物業。係陶錦新議員。

41
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,030
誒！我我不服啊！

42
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:54,660
我我其實覺得法律即係嘅分析嗰個係唔需要申報，不過既然大家我畀人嚇親咗，啊我申報係揾就經公資料，啊本人誒同我太太持有一個港島區嘅物業噉。

43
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:15,050
誒潘志潘少平議員，我都根據翻上次嗰個申報，我有物業啊。係誒，仲有冇其他人要申報？係誒，梁家傑議員。申報我有物業。係劉慧卿議員。申報有物業。係主席誒，唔係我我自己要申報。係我我申報我有物業，亦都我嘅誒。

44
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:24,620
我我受聘嘅公司有從事税務嘅誒顧問，我相信佢可能有從事相關嘅税務建議。我自己本人並冇嚇從事呢方面嘅諮詢工作嘅。

45
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:44,990
仲有冇其他人要申報？係石禮謙二主席，你哋申報你公司。如果要咁要執政嚟講，你而家邊間公司唔係唔唔係即係唔係唔係？而家有第啲成員嘅裏邊有啲公司係咩公司？而家咧，因為你如果要咁去做咧，真係你跌咗落個氹嗰度，你唔知道有啲人好厲害㗎。有時有個。

46
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,380
坐喺前邊添嘅啫。

47
00:08:46,700 --> 00:09:06,710
嗰個嚇啊啊啊嚇！嗰個即係你有咩咧？就係你咬住。如果你係邊啲公司，你要話咗你係邊啲公司，唔係挨畀人哋咧。行翻轉頭咬翻一啖啊，主席嚇！即係呢個保保保保障你嘅，你嘅真係嚇你個地位。主席，我係宣佈，我係呢個誒M T R M T R。

51
00:09:45,460 --> 00:10:04,630
解下今日使唔使申報咧？個公司其實所有要唔要申報都係議員自己決定嘅啫。係啊，係嗰個嗰個規矩咧，就係如果大家認為有直接或間接金錢利益咧，就需要喺發言前或者動議誒議案前申報。咁咧嗰個判斷咧就係議員㗎啦，係嘛？法律顧問，你可唔可以補充啦？

52
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:14,460
係啦，冇冇補充啦，我已經同佢爭拗咗好耐啦，都係一樣噉嘅噉嘅判斷啦。請自行決定啦。噉我新抱我嘅公司係有物業嘅。係。

53
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,770

噉啊！請政府當局啊進入會場。

係歡迎政府當局嘅代表進入會議室出席會議。咁早前咧係收到香港基督教協進會提交嘅意見書，已經轉達畀當局，希望佢回應。咁喺開會前咧，我亦都收到謝偉全議員同埋陶錦新議員嘅書面問題。咁誒，連同頭先嗰份一拼。

57
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:47,720

咧法案委員會要求政府當局就委員提出嘅關注提供資料，文件編號C.B.括弧一五一一足一二hyphen一三零一號文件。當局已經就有關事項作出回應，而該份文件咧而家已經喺會議席上提交。噉我邀請政府當局。

59
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,190
係就該份文件作出簡介，然後先請議員作出提問。係請問邊位？

60
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:29,510
Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I think the the paper as we've tabled is is fairly self-explanatory. I don't propose to go through it. Members will have had a chance to read it, but we're happy to answer questions on the paper. Okay.

61
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,160
啊。

62
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:43,190
大家已經睇咗當局嘅文件，噉啊想請睇下有冇議員係需要就住當局嘅文件係有提問或者進一步跟進嘅。

63
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,810
不如請當局簡單介紹文件啦。我諗議員都未進入嚇，O K。

64
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:06,180
因為今朝先收到誒好好大沓嘅文件，咁亦都有相當嘅內容，好嘛？我請當局介紹文件。Sure, sure. Let me just briefly take you through it. It's no problem.

65
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,590
真正去睇嗰啲文。

66
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:33,880
係咪啲時間短，文件長嚇？多謝，即係即係噉啊！去咧，即係嗰個，即係我哋唔係就噉係即係橡皮圖章咁去吸個印噉，即係即係我即係個會咧。你你都有個時間限，你做主席都要限制住佢幾時要交啲文件嚟畀我哋，唔可以就噉話今日今朝早攞個文件出嚟，而家就叫。

67
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:53,890
我問問題。佢今朝早，我由朝頭早開會開到十二點幾，冇時間去睇。你都係做主席，今朝早係咪？我都係食飯先睇。係啦，噉你食飯，你你你你唔食飯，我要食飯啊嘛，主席。係議員嘅議員提出嘅關注點都係好實在嘅。噉我請政府當局留意提交。

68
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,820
交文件嘅時間啦，若然。

69
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:08,010
我唔問問題，唔係，要下一次咧就要問翻依一個依個依個文件嘅問題，因為我冇睇個文件，我唔會去，我唔會去問一啲嘢，我唔未睇過啊，主席。

70
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:28,410
好噉啊！有議員有噉嘅要求，噉我希望誒政府當局盡力誒簡單介紹文件。噉啊，請誒政府當局介紹文件。你係提問定係有意見啊？我朱Sir，我有意見啦，即係我哋不嬲同佢有規有矩㗎啦。即係嗰幾多個工作天係咪先？呢個正正就係如果我冇記錯。

71
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:48,420
係佢應該五個工作天嚟，咁跟住秘書處咧就可以四個工作天畀到我哋。噉你至去討論個文件嘛？咁唔係呢個規矩，你除非話好特別嘅啫。如果唔係，即係何必要要即係好似今朝抌個文件入嚟噉，等於乜啫？即係我係覺得好大意見啊！好啊，或者秘書處補充。

72
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,350
通一下嚇。

73
00:14:49,630 --> 00:15:09,640
啊！就誒誒，政府嘅回應咧，我哋咧係誒星誒上個禮拜五咧誒，就係傍晚咧，就我諗係七點幾誒八點嘅時候咧，我哋就透過呢個誒誒電郵咧，就收到嗰個回應嘅。噉啊，故此咧，就我哋今朝早一早咧，就誒urgent by fax咧。

74
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:29,650
誒就係發畀誒，同埋亦都有誒電郵咧，就係發畀誒各位員。咁誒都希望咧，就係誒盡量爭取時間咧，誒就等誒各位員咧即係有機會誒，或者喺誒開會之前咧，就係誒睇下啲文件噉樣。噉啊，同埋同一時間，我哋都係啊誒，即係table喺個誒席位誒。

75
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,300
座位度噉樣，係啊，張議員。

76
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:42,560
對秘書處有意見啊！即係我覺得而家我哋秘書處做到死啊！即係呢個呢個政府而家搞乜鬼啊！大佬星期五晚電郵嚟。

77
00:15:42,840 --> 00:16:02,850
咁點啊？個個開開夜車等你嚟啊？係咪先喺我嚟講嗰個星期五晚一定唔係個工作日嚟嘅。星期六係咪？如果你話要畀我哋五日，噉你一啊自己冇五日先。第二咧，我哋做到死㗎嘛？禮拜二個秘書處係咪先？噉你即係而家秘書都點做啊？

78
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:22,860
咁噉，你你喺噉嘅情形之下，我覺得咧就成提都傾都唔好傾。佢總言之唔夠五日工作天嚟到嘅咧，就直情唔好擺佢上台咪留下次傾咯。而家呢條條例唔係話逼切到聽日我哋唔傾，今日唔傾，我哋死得人㗎嘛？係咪？大家同時都要睇清睇楚住去講嘢噉。

79
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:41,430
咁呢個你又你？如果政府持續係諗住星期二開會，可以星期五晚嚇訂啲文件嚟，又要我哋去睇，今日去討論，即係我又覺得嘥氣啦。你中意叫佢解解釋啊？解釋，即係我又覺得即係嘥我時間啫。我話多謝張議員嘅意見。

80
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,610
誒我。

81
00:16:42,930 --> 00:17:02,940
有冇補充啊？誒，秘書處有補充係誒誒，就誒，其實因為咧就誒，我哋通常咧就係話誒幾時交誒回應啊或者文件咧，都視乎咧就誒，即係誒個委即係誒誒會議同會議之間相隔嗰個嗰個誒期誒時時間㗎。咁因為咧誒，我哋誒今次呢個啊。

82
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:19,810
委員會咧，我哋編定嘅時間咧都係幾密下嘅。噉我哋比如上次誒開會係一月誒二十五號啊開會噉樣樣，咁所以誒即係變成咧就喺嗰個誒即係誒誒Amin誒當局咧就回應個時間可能係比較緊迫啲。

83
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:34,040
嗱噉樣啦，議員嘅意見已經好清楚啦。下次阿張議員，主席，我我希望秘書咧都唔需要太客氣同人哋解釋啦。呢個唔係我哋嘅問題。即係如果我哋不嬲擺咗喺度，話明五個工作天。

84
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,840
你啲文件要嚟。

85
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:53,400
喂，五個工作天啊，就應該好似唔計佢嚟嗰日，唔計開會嗰日，即係你星期二呢日唔計，今日星期幾啊？今日星期一唔計，咁咧你星期六你星期五晚畀我，已經嗰日冇得計㗎啦，即係我當你星期六嚟到。

86
00:17:53,810 --> 00:18:13,820
咁秘書已經做得好快脆啦。今日啊，已經有嘢出係一日噉，但係我哋要求佢嗰個五日工作天嚟四日工作天，秘書出得到去呢個，我覺得佢應該要嚴守，唔應該話因為我哋編得密，編得密你咪你咪做快啲咯，係咪？我哋啲秘書做到死，政府咁多公務員咁點啊？

87
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:33,830
好啦，議員嘅意見聽到啦。嗱，我哋計翻咧一月廿五號開會之後咧，其實政府當局咧係得五個工作天。誒，禮拜一號咧都係五個工作天咧去回應嘅啫。咁嗱，議員嘅意見大家好清晰啦。噉我哋喺安排會議嘅時間都考慮到雙方嘅工作誒時間。咁今日我建議咧先討論文件，若然議員之後個。

88
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,560
嗰個會咧，就住呢份文件又再提問啦。噉我都容許議員再提問啦。劉慧卿議員，你有冇意見？誒，主席啊！

89
00:18:40,950 --> 00:19:00,960
嗱，我相信當局係應該跟翻我哋定嗰啲時間去提交文件啦。但係咧開呢啲誒草案委員會咧，好多時係開得好安排得好密。噉樣咧，其實好多嘢咧，議員已經好熟㗎啦。頭先最弊秘書長咧，你叫佢介紹，佢唔介紹啦。你睇過噉啊，即係即係重親大家。

90
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:20,970
解條筋啦嚇，佢明知明知啱啱先擺出嚟，佢話睇過。老實講，如果佢逐段去講啊，解釋下，噉啊，議員就可以問。即係我亦都唔會覺得啊，除咗呢份文件要討論嘅嘢，就冇其他嘢可以問啦。有陣時委員會話好，你呢份文件嚟嚟得太急，我擺埋一邊，噉我哋咪討論其他要討論。

91
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:40,980
嘅嘢咯，幾樣都可以處理嘅。主席就唔可以話而家就不如放學啦噉樣嚇噉，所以咧即係一個做法就係問其他嘢啦嚇。上次未問到嘅一個咧就係秘書長就呢個講翻畀議員聽噉，原因望落去啊，或者唔使望落去啊，都知道要問咩㗎啦。噉我覺得就即係希望當局咧就盡量把。

92
00:19:40,980 --> 00:20:00,990
呃個時間，但係呢個委員會咁多嘢要傾係咪啊？主席，噉我覺得就睇下大家選擇啲，大家同意傾嗰啲就一齊傾啦。好多謝劉議員嘅意見。嗱，我諗我建議都係咁啦。我哋照翻邀請政府當局簡單介紹文件，然後請議員提問。若然議員喺下次仲希望就住呢個議題啊提問咧，噉我都繼續容許。

93
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,820
其實呢個都一定係會容許㗎啦，好嘛？我哋把握時間啦，政府當局請你介紹文件啦。

94
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:26,610
Thank you, Madam Chair. I fully accept that we try and respond, but to be fair to both the secretariat and us, we were asked to give the information on the 29th. We gave it on the 1st. There really is as short as we could possibly have responded. We will, of course, always try to correspond to members' timetable, and I apologise.

95
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:38,140
Apologise if this is inconvenient, but we're trying to move as quickly as we can. And obviously, in this circumstances with meetings so close together, we we can only do our best.

96
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:49,470
Let me take us through the paper then. And the suggestion that we do it paragraph by paragraph is probably the sensible way. I'll stop after each paragraph, and then if members have questions, we're happy to answer them.

97
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
嗯。

98
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:59,440
Let me start at paragraph two of the paper, which responds to the question on the effectiveness of the special stamp duty.

99
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,320
啊。

100
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:15,300
Let me start by stating what is said here. The special stamp duty was intended to curb short-term speculative activities in the residential property market and to ensure the market's healthy and stable development.

101
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:25,510
我們相信，特別印花税已經有效，在壓制短期 speculative 活動，自實施於 2010 年 11 月。

102
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:45,800
According to information held by the Inland Revenue Department, following the enactment of the enabling legislation, the number of confirm or and resale cases within 24 months have dropped significantly. The total number of such transactions in 2011 represented a 42.5% reduction as compared to 2010.

103
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:56,490
和進一步 drop of 56% was recorded in 2012 when compared to 2010. I think the figures frankly speak for themselves.

104
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,380
any questions on that first paragraph?

105
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,620
石禮軒儀。

106
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes, thank you, Madam President, Mr. Chairman. Is

107
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:28,130
the statement that the SSD has been effective in curbing short-term speculative activities since its implementation, and that a stable and healthy market, the market since the introduction of SSD since November is anything but stable or steady, because the prices have been rising since November.

108
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,210
到新 peak， even now in。

109
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,460
this。

110
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,270
太無聲，reach a height that it never have。

111
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,840
Rich，that's twenty thousand per square foot。

112
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,170
Can he explain what is healthy? What is stable?

113
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,300
啊！政府當局咪。

114
00:22:49,730 --> 00:23:00,090
I think there are two aspects to this. The first aspect is have we taken out the short-term and confirmers sales? I think the figures speak for themselves. That has happened.

115
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:20,380
Of course, that doesn't take out the domestic demand and demand from end users, and that I think is the situation which we'll come onto later in this paper, which the buyer's stamp duty is intended to help us to address. But you know, as I said, all of our measures are determined along the lines of can we try and maintain a healthy

116
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,930
healthy and stable development in the marketplace, of course.

117
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:38,750
你哋要見見，什麼係主要目標，係每一個元素嘅措施，喺呢個情況下，措施係要剔除短期嘅説謊，我哋相信係達成咗。

118
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,720
多謝主席。

119
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:49,920
段落二政府表示，政府的目的是要遏止短期 speculative 活動。

120
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,430
which sounds a reasonable policy.

121
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,710
但。

122
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,930
Are we sure that what we're seeing now is curbing the short-term speculative activity? How about investors?

123
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:22,670
I think in the past, when someone buy something for X amount of money and then after a year, well, he made a reasonable profit, so his investor turned into a seller. Government will turn that as a speculator. But now these people are simply holding back because they figure if they sell it within one or two years, they will have to.

124
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:29,190
pay a substantial amount of tax, so they're holding on to it. So the end result is you have no seller.

125
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:36,210
你有等數量的買者，而無賣者，噉樣價格會去到無處，但係上，所以就 defeats government's purpose。

126
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,450
所以， Chairman， may I just ask that？

127
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,030
Although government said that the transaction in 2011,

128
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:48,500
represent a 42.5 reduction and then 201 to 56% reduction.

129
00:24:48,780 --> 00:25:06,600
sounds good, but could you mention the price? I have a feeling the price did not drop by 42%. It probably went up by 42%. So if you take a reduction in transaction, but the upward movement in price, that actually deprives people in Hong Kong of buying house.

130
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,030
at steadily increasing price.

131
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:30,890
True or not? Franken, please. Thank you. I think again, we have to look at the market as a whole. What we're tackling is taking the very short-term, what we call speculative and conformer sales. That's of people who buy and sell even before they receive the the the property into their control.

132
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:40,580
那 sort of thing has effectively been taken out of the market. But as members are well aware, the market is affected by many other factors, and those factors

133
00:25:40,860 --> 00:26:00,870
which have changed in the period since two thousand and ten when this was introduced include the introduction of QE three, the continued very low interest rates, the influx of money from overseas, these are the issues that have driven the market up, and those are the issues that we're now trying to deal with in the second part of.

134
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,490
what this bill deals with, which is buyer's stamp duty, so.

135
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,640
The two parts of this bill represents an enhancement to.

136
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:17,000
Continue the effectiveness against the short-term speculative activities. The second part, the buyer stamp duty, deals with the other issues.

137
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,790
主席。

138
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:31,480
鄧肯，唔 reply my question。我問佢喺啲figure，佢 quoted 2011 42% reduction in transaction，what is the price movement？did it go up or also went down？

139
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:42,240
I think the market has has increased and prices have increased during that time. Any idea how much? Five percent, ten percent, twenty percent, forty-two percent. Do we have those figures? Perhaps we can let you have them later.

140
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:53,230
Yeah, we'll we'll let you have those later. So, will government agree that if the transaction go down by forty-two percent, with prices going up by ten fifteen percent, it's a failure in his policy? No.

141
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,040
Thank you. Very short answer.

142
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,400
劉慧卿業。

143
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:16,100
主席，我 want to ask about the the numbers of confirmar and resale cases within the twenty four months have dropped significantly. So the administration is saying that all these are short term speculative activities. Is that is that right?

144
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,980
Is how that's how you define. That's right. It's set out in Table Two to the paper.

145
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:38,560
所以它沒有影響到真正的買家。那係我們嘅觀點。佢冇阻止想買自己嘅人。你有數字講呢個？如果睇總協議，係第一列。

146
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,950
That would we would argue represents the the genuine end-term buyers. In other words, not the short-term buyers.

147
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,620
Sorry, are you talking about Annex B? Which which table? Annex Annex A, sorry.

148
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,520
annex A。

149
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:05,830
The first column are the sorry. Please go. Yeah, let me explain again. Annex A represents the breakdown of special stamp duty cases.

150
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:17,930
by the end of 2012. That's this year's, right? And that shows the numbers are very small within the six months, twelve, six to twelve.

151
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,780
and 12 to 24 months, but if you look at

152
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,020
Annex B, Table 2.

153
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,530
第一列，其中的總合是總合的總合，以年為單位。

154
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:40,360
be the effect of those total agreements for for sale shows that the majority, if you take out the numbers.

155
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:49,350
那subtotal B， would be what we would regard as as normal end user buyers， so the the numbers are still very high.

156
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,380
那係公司，OK，但係總協議是相同。

157
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:15,040
maybe maybe you want to give the official next sitting next to you a chance to explain. Perhaps Mr. or whoever can explain. 好，解一解，邊一位誒介紹咧？係我哋阿黃生。佢依份文件就因應上次議員提問，就講到公司名義係買賣嘅。咁其實我哋早前你對住個麥講好冇，我哋聽。

158
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:35,050
唔到你講嘢。而家依個第二份呢份表咧，就因應上次委員提問，係講翻用有限公司名義去買賣，而係短期內賣翻出去嘅個案例嘅。咁如果想睇個整體嘅數字咧，咁其實我哋喺十一月喺嗰個誒financial affairs panel度有啲數目字提供嘅，而家講翻大約個數啦，譬如。

159
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,090
二零一零年。

160
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,510
所謂魔課咧，大約有三千八百宗。

161
00:29:40,220 --> 00:30:00,230
二零一一年咧個摩課咧就去到大約係八百八十宗，到到二零一二年一月到九月期間咧，大約係二百五十宗噉，所以由總數由三千八去到減到去大約係誒。阿主席，我唔知佢睇緊邊個表，你講啲數字，我睇個表係冇嘅。你你要。

162
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:20,240
有先同我哋講咧。如果係噉，即係開會開到後年都開唔完啦，唔該你哋啦。尤其是我，我又冇跟到嗰啲，但係我以為你今次會好清楚講畀我聽。主席，你明唔明佢講乜啊？我喺度猛咁揾啲數字，原來冇嘅，咁點搞咧？啊，主席，你處理下啦。誒，你頭先講嘅數字或者個表有冇喺呢份文件裏邊包括？

163
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,570
冇嘅，咁不如之後再補充翻啦，好嘛？

164
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:33,640
O.K.噉我哋點點問嘢咧，主席？O.K.繼續，噉啊請政府統局。O.K. O.K. 雪條。唉，真係攪搞。O.K. Duncan， please.

165
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:42,690
Okay, going on, paragraph three. Okay，陶景新議員，即係咁搞。誒，主席，我我睇緊附表一啊。

166
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,050
嗱，附表一咧嗰度誒。

167
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:58,400
就係誒個個案咧，就係誒誒，你你想講啦嚇，即係政府想講咧，就係話誒六個月以下，因為抽最高啦，即係就賣啦噉樣，就係八啊九宗。

168
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:11,780
咁誒嗱，我就要咁諗啊，因為咧，你而家嗰個講法咧就係話唔夠效啊嘛，即係唔夠弱啊，弱弱效。於是咧就加重嗰個。

169
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:25,180
誒税率噉樣啊嘛，咁好啦嗱，我舉一例就用一個數字先啦，譬如六個月以以下就買啦，咁即係一買入六個月就買啦，噉啊八九宗，噉你係一定係講緊咧就係二零一零年。

170
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,840
誒十一月生效以嚟啦，咁即係嗰度咧，其實就係講緊誒兩年。

171
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,430
啊，零兩個月啦，噉我當兩年先啦，OK嚇。

172
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,530
噉我想問啦，兩兩年裏邊。

173
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,760
全部買賣啊！即係誒個transaction。

174
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,740
有幾多宗咧？係咪我係咪即係話要睇翻喺邊度先至睇到啊？

175
00:31:49,390 --> 00:32:09,400
係咪就係話誒一一從一二夾埋，應該係有十八萬宗啊嘛？即係我如果睇翻附件二啊，我唔知係嘛嗱附件二嗰度咧買賣協議總數咧，二零零一二零一一年係九萬六㗎嘛，二零一二年咪九萬一啦，係咪咁？於是即係話咧，如果我對翻附件一，即係話嗰八啊九宗。

176
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,650
係交十五percent嘅B S D你嘅咧，其實係佔。

177
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,170
十九萬宗。

178
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,690
十八萬七千宗啊！

179
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,130
嘅八十九宗嘅喎。

180
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,830
噉你即係話？

181
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,080
呢個税率唔唔止到級。

182
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:34,430
或者你話嗱，六至十二個月就一百八十、一百九十八宗，就交十percent畀你。

183
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:44,730
咁即係換句話講咧，其實係十八萬七千宗裏邊有二百宗啦，當係六至十二個月就買啦，因為佢納十個percent。你話唔夠效咁？

184
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:59,820
哇！咁似乎你你畀我睇嚟講咧，好似係好夠效喎，即係我可能應該話啊，政府好夠效喎。咁但係你話點啊？你想到到咧，就係十九萬宗裏邊咧，一宗都冇嘅，噉你不如抽一百啦，抽一萬都得㗎。

185
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,070
佢聲啦。

186
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:21,360
係嘛？即係即係，你要你要你要衡量所謂咁短期就炒賣係唔夠力噉。你要睇成個大圖畫㗎嘛？個圖大圖畫，我如果冇對錯，就係二十萬宗裏邊如果有九十宗都唔夠一百宗。喂，咁呢個你記住，因為我哋我我我咁啱上一個誒呢個。

187
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,610
主席就做主席啊！咁當時咧有好多同事咧就咁講嘅喎，喂，會唔會有啲死人冧樓啊？即係大家嚟試下，即係喂佢一買咗。

188
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,580
嚇！即係個二十萬宗裏邊。

189
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:51,870
就被逼要賣嘅噉，當然你話被逼話你被逼幾好喎？你被逼賺錢你咁happy你係嘛？因為冇跌噉樣，餵你唔知人哋個原因係乜嘢，但係二十萬宗裏邊有十宗係喺百一百宗都唔夠，係六個月或以下賣噉，其實你咪好成功咯，即係你由好高跌到落好。

190
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,340
低。

191
00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:12,630
其實你好成功喎，噉係咪你咁成功你仲要仲要加多好高咧？咁嗱，我我真係好小心，因為咧理論上嚟，你任何一個任何一樣嘢唔好話税添啦，就算你話罰款啊抌垃圾千五蚊唔夠，咁一萬五啦咁咁實少啲抌㗎。但係你嗰個marginal嗰個誒decrease同埋呢呢譬如。

192
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:25,190
呢度我唔知啦，譬如你要一千宗、二千宗、幾廿宗，係唔係就對民生構成直接嘅影響，而要打到佢係零咧？因為你叫呢個世界，佢佢可能好多種原因係需要。

193
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:45,520
嗰個十二個月或者半年內賣出，當然佢一定係有炒價啦。但係你係咪？如果你一做嘅時候咧，就係咪要噉樣做咧？噉你呢個冇永遠都係無止境嘅，去到零都得嘅。我陶議員，你好清楚啦，個立嗰個論點係政府當局。我即係我揾個數字，我噉樣係咪錯咗先？我係咪二十萬宗裏邊其實就係？

194
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,450
二十萬宗嚟睇呢千幾宗，誒九十宗係咪咁？

195
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,180
係邊位回應咧？

196
00:34:51,460 --> 00:35:05,430
can you clarify the figures？啊，Mr.黃係咪黃生？黃副局長係喺誒附表A嗰度咧，就係講緊係由誒嗰個啊，印花税生效之後。

197
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,230
嘅數目。

198
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:22,610
即係正如語員所講，就係誒少過六個月嘅要交呢個印花税八十九宗，六至十二個月就一百九十八宗，十二至十四個月即係一千五百四十九宗。呢啲物要交一呢啲印花税嘅物業咧，就係喺二零一零年十。

199
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:40,720
一月二十號購入先要交嘅，啊！如果有啲物業係之前購入嘅，唔需要交嘅，啊！咁跟住再比對翻，即係話議員所講誒，大約十八萬七千宗嗰個成交數量就係表二嗰個啦，後邊啊，裏邊N S B Table Two嗰個。

200
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,680
有呢個總共係即係有三個數啦，即係睇大家誒左手邊第二行嗰第二個直行嗰度，total agreements for sale嗰度。

201
00:35:48,960 --> 00:36:02,000
咁九萬六千零三十四宗咧，就係當年嘅住宅物業嘅買賣合約嘅成交數量；九萬一千二百六十四就係誒二零一二年嘅成交總數。咁如果純粹將即係話講誒，

202
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:14,010
附表A同附表B裏邊嘅第二份表比較，就好似望落去好低啦，啊，因為呢度係包咗一啲九萬六千或者九萬一千咧，係包括咗一啲係。

203
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,660
佢係喺二零一零年十一月十。

204
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,820
九號之前買入嘅物業，嗰啲物業。

205
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,440
如果之後買咧，唔需要畀個印花税。

206
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:42,910
主席啊，噉我唔知你有冇一啲嗱誒，舉個例，你而家分析呢度誒誒，唔係，因為我要搞清楚啲數字，知道個效果咩？而家一定要係長詳細研究嘅。你譬如呢度有千幾宗啊，噉你不如你可，我唔知你翻嚟做唔做到咧？即係舉例係。

207
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,340
誒，二零一零年十一月之後買入嘅。

208
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:55,890
其實呢啲全部都係㗎啦，因為你交得呢個税，即係一定係噉。嗰度有幾多？即係佔十八萬七千宗裏邊嘅。

209
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:18,190
唔係喎，十八萬七千宗咪就係喺二零一零年隻首月之後買入嘅嘢咯。係啊，咁咪即係，咁咪即係好細個數字。嗱嗱，我咁諗，你你平時我哋噉樣一般嘅嘅諗法，如果你話誒誒，因為物業都要交頭㗎嘛，係咪？噉你你買入咗，你有可能係要賣。

210
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,760
出嘅有可能嘅，呢個世界係又會有轉流㗎嘛。

211
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,100
咁如果換句話講，我當你六個月或以下係九十宗。

212
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,540
即係佔一萬十八萬七千宗嘅九十宗。

213
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,210
其實，即係你個税率係好有效咯。

214
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,580
即係你係要呢個九十宗六個月以下嘅係加到咧。

215
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,220
係零啊！定加到等佢變咗五十四十咧？

216
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:56,300
好，邊位回應咧？圖緊圖緊新轉過分析。The the point I think that we need to to bear in mind here is that it is clear that the further you get from the date of purchase.

217
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,340
The original date of purchase.

218
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,710
until you sell， the effectiveness of the rates that we set for special stamp duty declines dramatically.

219
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:26,030
We know that in the first six months, the rates are still relatively effective. But we can see a trend of people starting to sell more, particularly when the rate of increase in the property prices exceeds fifteen per cent. People can still get a value out of that. Within six months, they're going to sell. So we need to look at that as one factor. Is the fifteen per cent

220
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:46,040
percent for the first six months still effective in a market which is rising relatively rapidly or has been. The second point that we want to bring out is that as you move forward into the second six month and then the next year, there is a huge jump from one hundred and ninety eight to one five hundred. It's clear that the effectiveness of the rates.

221
00:38:46,040 --> 00:39:06,050
At five percent in the twelve to twenty-four months period is dramatically less, and of course, as you go into what would now be the third year, the the extended period, we don't have those figures. But I can tell you that the numbers of sales jumps again. So the proposal here is to.

222
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,810
respond to the actual situation in the market. That the effectiveness

223
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:30,100
of these early rates fifteen ten five has diminished. We want to ensure that they continue to have this effect at these levels. But we also recognise that we need to extend it to continue the effect, and that's what we're talking about here. It's the change, the rate of change in the increase in the number of transactions over time that we need to.

224
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:50,110
address，and that's what we're doing。主席請請佢，因為你已經發言咗一次時間啦。我叫畀啲唔係主席咧，因為你個題目，我叫畀啲數字，你説服我。究竟你你嗰啲呢度啲數字，你你點樣分析係話冇效咧？係嘛？因為你都係少過你，就算廿四個月都係少過一個percent係廿四個月喎。

225
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,150
係嘛？噉你話冇效？噉你你係幾多？你覺得先叫有效咧？

226
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:08,860
好啊，之後再回應好嘛？覺得好有效喎，真係。嗯，嗱，而家有兩位議員表示要第二輪發言，有冇其他人誒第一第一輪嘅？阿謝偉俊議員，我建議三分鐘啦，好嘛？因為大家都好踴躍，先以三分鐘作為試行。

227
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:32,410
誒，我哋頭先咧講過個利益申報嘅，我都盡我嘅可能性去提醒委員。若然你認為你有直接或間接金錢利益咧，按照秘書處嘅建議咧，我哋都係喺發言前咧考慮申報，自行決定嚇。阿謝議員，請你繼續。即係我先申報，我係有持有公有限公司間接持有物業。兩點都同。誒。

228
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:42,650
主席，我想跟進翻同個新議員所講問題。咁似乎咧，我哋嗰個誒交投數字咧，明顯地咧越近即係越短期嘅，似乎越多，呢個係事實。

229
00:40:42,930 --> 00:41:02,940
咁但係咧就樓嘅價格方面咧就不跌反升，噉啊問題就係咁啦。係咪話我哋要將嗰個交投嘅數字減到去零咧？理論上咧，就當然啲價又唔會升，又唔會跌啦，最有效啦，即係大家都見唔到，即係呢個陀，即係叫做掩耳盜鈴又好，或者係誒陀鳥。

230
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:16,000
埋有頭喺沙又好啦，咁跟住冇交頭就冇價格，冇升冇升價啦，咁大家好開心啦，拍手掌啦噉。咁但係噉樣只係玩死咗成個成個地產物業，包括最慘首當其沖當然係啲地產代理啦。

231
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:36,290
咁但係你話，如果我哋係針對嗰個價格嘅飆升咧，其實係咪當然大家都明白到啦，係真係喺個供應上面著想先能夠做到嘢。咁而家我哋係將佢成件事係好不自然地frozen咗佢，即係凍結咗佢，唔畀佢做。咁不如咁啦，係咪應該真係由而家開始禁止買賣？

232
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:43,260
賣物業兩年咧，咁咪最有效咧。係，啊， Duncan。Yes, I think。

233
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:55,070
the the issue about increasing supply is well taken and that is exactly why in the the recent policy address we did indeed announce the increases in both the

234
00:41:55,350 --> 00:42:15,360
公共 housing rental and home ownership, as well as the private sector. We remember, we're talking sixty-seven thousand units that are under construction or should be available for sale within the next four years. That is a substantial increase over the previous four or five to ten years, actually. So there's no dispute. We agree. We have.

235
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:28,060
得要增加供應，那係努力去增加土地供應。但係，暫時你亦都要睇下現有的措施，確保佢哋係第一。

236
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:48,560
proportionate and reasonable for what we're trying to do, and in this case, in special stamp duty, as we've said, we think that it is now appropriate time to look at adjustments to reflect what's happening in the marketplace, and do we need to introduce some new measures? In this in this case, it's by stamp duty to deal with this other issue of giving priority to Hong Kong people.

237
00:42:48,560 --> 00:43:08,570
到買 property in the local market，因為 there is an。 I answered the honourable member earlier。 There are other issues that come in to affect the marketplace in Hong Kong。正正就因為有其他可能要考慮其他嘅措施、其他嘅因素咧，即係好似譬如我哋話想減人吸煙咁啦，我哋一路加税咧，其實到咁上下就冇曬。

238
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:28,580
嗰啲margin to efficiency嘅啦，而家呢個一樣道理就係好似陶尹生議員所講，我哋其實transaction話其實已經減咗好多嘅啦，但係價錢反為就唔係咁有效。咁呢個時候係係咪真係要再減、再減、再減咧？噉係咪呢個係一個方向係係啱啊？定還是應該係及時考慮下其他更加有效嘅措施，先能夠真正有新嘅efficiency咧，而唔係好似？

239
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,480
我哋再做翻啲舊嘢咧，再做啲嘅效果會嚟越跌嘅咧，主席。

240
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:47,210
Duncan, any comment? Well, as I say, I think these are some of the measures, but fundamentally we we have acknowledged and we repeat, increasing supply is the best solution, and that's what we're focusing on. So we are looking at a range of different measures.

241
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:54,380
謝偉銓議員，誒，主席就，頭先誒，署長講咗，即係話誒。

242
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,220
嗰個十二至十四個月，嗰個誒。

243
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:19,510
個案嘅數字相對嚟講咧，就比嗰啲，因為佢要畀百分之五嘅税啦，其他嗰啲咧百分之十、十五嗰啲，相對嚟講咧個比例就好大啦。雖然即係佢一千五百幾宗咧，其實都係相對嗰個總共買賣唔多。反而我想問一問咧，就係其實而家就延長個時。

244
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:30,330
間到三十六個月，噉係咪誒有好多數據指明咧？即係話喺好多買賣咧，或者叫佢投機咧，係喺三十六個月內。

245
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,100
即係會有再次買賣嘅，你有冇啲數據咧？呢啲數據。

246
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,820
係係咪？

247
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:44,300
根據啲數據，所以支持將由原本二十四個月將佢褪到三十六個月。佢。

248
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,380
邊位回應？鄧勤。

249
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,690
Madam Chair, let me let me start, and I think my colleagues will will supplement.

250
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,000
I think there are two elements here. The first is, as I said before, are the

251
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:16,530
rates effective for the period that they were originally set, and that's the first 24 months. We think that the effect is diminishing, and we need to reinforce those. That's the first element. The second element is if the rate if the the rate of increase is such that

252
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:35,360
We introduce a flat 10% for this end of the first year to the end of the third year. That's the second 24 month period. Will that have a continuous effect on these short term resales? Yes, we believe that is the fact, and we believe that.

253
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:44,340
The need for that stems from from the information that we we're looking at here, and we will try and provide more detailed information separately.

254
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,620
但。

255
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:53,380
It is it is a fact that the further you get away from your original purchase date, upon your sell, your your sale.

256
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:10,770
the if the if the rates are not at a sufficiently high level to counteract the increase in value in the property, it's going to have no effect. So that's why we believe these figure these figures do show that effect, and that's why not only are we increasing the rates, but we're also extending the period.

257
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,470
胡志偉議員。

258
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:31,360
誒，其實同同事咧講咗就係話咧，我哋嗰個誒sales of flats咧係減少咗，嚇個transaction係減少咗，但係個樓價上升。噉我哋望一望咧，第三段咧，其實即係政府都係咁講嘅，就係話誒。

259
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,280
喺。

260
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:55,120
二零一三一二年嘅九月開始咧，嗰個係transaction係上升嘅，因為陸續續咧有啲額外印花税實施後早期購嘅物業咧已經被持有啦。咁咧，所以應該咧就會係誒可以有多啲樓房咧拎出嚟做transactions噉樣樣。咁其實呢一個不是正好就係話即係話咗就係話嗰個。

261
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:15,130
額外印花税第一產生嘅效果咧，係減少咗個短期嘅供應，而經過兩年時間之後慢慢消化咗，噉佢嗰個供應出現咗嘅時間理論上啦，供應會增加翻，亦都應該係令到嗰個嘅係樓房嘅價格咧，係某程度上，起碼喺呢一個環節上邊咧，係回復翻正常嘅。

262
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:35,140
處境或者係喺個市場上邊咧，係提供翻啲之前係因為個誒誒誒印花税係鎖死咗嘅一啲供應嘅。噉我想問下就係，第一呢一個係咪呢一段文字所描繪嘅形嘅事情啦？咁第一點，第二個就係即係正如頭先同事問開，咁其實我哋印花税嘅總目。

263
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:55,150
目標係啲咩嘢咧？如果我哋話係處理短期嘅一個誒炒賣嘅情況，咁當然我哋見到個數字反映就相當之有效果啦。已經噉，但係我哋要處理到去到乜嘢嘅一個水平，或者簡單講，我哋整個即係誒額外印花税嘅目標係要定喺邊一個位置嚇？

264
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:15,160
因為好明顯就係我哋要處理嘅就係除咗係短期炒賣，我哋唔想見到。我哋之唔想見到短期炒賣，係因為見到就係因為呢啲短期炒賣係引致到嘅樓宇價格嘅係一路噉樣飆升上去啊嘛。噉我想問下就係其實局方係點樣睇呢個問題，同埋第三段所描繪嘅情況係咪代表咗你都承認亞潤花税其實係所

265
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:26,430
鎖死咗短期嘅供應，而家啱兩年差唔多完嘅時候咧，其實個供應咧就會係出現翻，係令到嗰個嘅係市場咧，誒喺起碼市場上面嘅供應咧係有所增加嘅。

266
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:38,550
Duncan, please. Thank you. I think we're actually now talking about paragraph three. Yeah, I think. So perhaps I can I can answer this anyway. And let me deal with the first point.

267
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:58,840
The whole point of introducing special stamp duty was not to lock in, but was to stop people buying in and therefore getting locked in. And I think that has been effective, as the figures themselves seem to suggest. In the short period, six months to twelve months, fewer people actually buy in, and therefore there should be.

268
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:18,880
less of a constraint if you want. So I think that's that's probably right, but and as we try to describe in paragraph three here, the problem is that as we as we progressed, be you know a year, year and two years after the introduction of SSD, the effectiveness has diminished. And just to quote the figures.

269
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:30,500
如果你 look in the middle of paragraph three， the number of such cases has been on the rise from 83 in March 2012 to 218 in September of 201

270
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:40,050
二，那 shows that in a very short space of time between March and September， the number of cases that are caught by SST has increased dramatically.

271
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,450
Clearly.

272
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:53,170
we either we either accept that the effect is diminishing, or we try to maintain the effect. and our option is to maintain the effect. hence the proposals that we brought forward here.

273
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,700
主席，係第二輪，係誒第二輪係阿石禮謙議員。

274
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:11,970
都係三分鐘啦，係嘛？主席啊，即係英文有句説話咧，statistic lies lies lies，冚唪唥都係大話嘅，主席。即係如果你淨係睇翻去Annex A嗰度咧。

275
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:23,520
即係佢啲，佢用嗰啲字，用嗰啲用嗰啲噉嘅數字咧，打擊炒家，唉，有效，因為已經係減少好多。但係咧，打擊買家就撲街啦。

276
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:44,890
依個係啊，所以咧，你淨係睇佢啲，淨係因為啊，主席，因為嗰個成個設計咧，就好似頭先阿阿田少講啦。因為你係依個S S D咧，就係只可買不可賣，噉啊，整入喺個供應嗰度就唔夠啦。噉啊，谷谷起啲價，咁冚棒咧。如果你睇翻佢啲數字，

277
00:50:44,890 --> 00:51:04,900
咧number of cases嗰度咁即喺十八萬呢呢個喺咁短嘅時間得嗰兩個percent，因為打擊嗰兩個percent就全香港嘅人就要畀貴樓，因為佢縮小咗呢個第一個。第二個咧，主席，我想去澄清下啲figure咧。二零一一年成年係得九萬六個成交。

278
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:24,910
依啲可唔可以確定翻依啲依數字喺度啦？同埋二零二零一二年咧，總共依個transaction九萬一啊，主席有幾多？可唔可以喺依度咧？話畀我聽，有幾多人新樓，幾多人舊樓？嚇！嗱，主席依度啲你如果你由十五萬，如果佢第一第二段嗰陣時你睇到咧，佢由

279
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:37,770
係就係議員，即係即係議員律誒，唔係佢啲誒誒誒寫嘢係呃人㗎。你淨係睇二零一一年嗰個咧，十五萬一跌跌咗到二零一一年九萬六，跌到二零一二年。

280
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:58,060
九萬一，主席啊！呢個唔係因為炒家嘅問題，忽然間個供應咧縮細曬，所以你咪睇睇而家今時今日，哇！啲樓起到咁多，政府嘅政策帶嚟㗎，主席唔係地產霸權啊，主席。你睇一睇呢件事，真係好大件事，主席。所以我想去澄清下咧。

281
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:18,070
即係嗰啲數字係啱定係唔啱？定你睇翻啲嗰啲去N N X A嗰度咧，真係嚇害死啊！因為原來嗰啲人買樓啲就係因為嗰幾個嗰兩個percent炒樓就變咗九啊八個percent畀貴樓。主席，你可唔可以教我點睇睇？因為兩個兩個表都係唔同。如果你睇翻咧，好清楚啦。

282
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:31,770
所以佢用呢啲表嚟睇咧，就係嚇確認確翻認啲數字得唔得，主席？係，活利條眼色，等緊please。I I'll ask Mr. Wong to clarify the figures. But can I just point a couple of things out?

283
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,350
當我們談到供應的物業在市場。

284
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,510
There's actually two elements.

285
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,410
第一元素，是什麼？我們講得比較常見，有多少？

286
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,350
first-hand properties come onto the market.

287
00:52:45,630 --> 00:53:05,640
And yes, in the last few years, the number has been lower than the traditional long-term average. Long-term average around twenty thousand. Twenty thousand per annum. Yes. About twenty thousand. Twenty thousand. You mean new, new, new, new build? Twenty thousand. Twenty thousand's not not long-term. That's the long-term average per annum.

288
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:25,650
過，

289
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,310
It's a substantial reduction.

290
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:47,970
however，那係只係一part of the total number of transactions in the marketplace。The majority， by a long way， I think it's eighty percent of the transactions are actually secondary。In other words， second hand。And this， Stewart， this is what I was talking about。陳議員，你等下秘書長答埋先啦，好嘛？係。我記住聽錯咗，啲人會誤會咗主席，所以我要話佢啱埋佢錯。主席。

291
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,030
嗱，好清楚嘅，Duncan，please continue。

292
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,120
And.

293
00:53:51,400 --> 00:54:11,410
Sorry, tell you second hand sales. The point that I'm trying to make here is that when we talk about you know one hundred and fifty five thousand or ninety six thousand or ninety one thousand, that covers both first hand and second hand sales. So the total reduction doesn't reflect a smaller supply because that second.

294
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:28,310
供應是多數，always。It's about the the ability to to buy in a rising market and the willingness to sell. Those are the determinants. And in this case, it has diminished. There's no doubt about it. But perhaps Mr. Wong can阿黃生有冇補充？

295
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:48,600
好，關於石議員剛才提問嘅一手、二手樓嗰個成交數目咧，其實即係九萬六千宗係二零一一年啦，九萬一千宗係二零一二年咧，就係喺我哋離任税署啲買樓嘅人去對代表律師拎上嚟嘅買賣合約係打離任税嘅數目嘅，啊，呢個係一個數目。有冇？

296
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:58,890
咁一手二手咧，係啦，譬如九誒二零一一年一手樓就九萬一六千宗，裏邊其中一萬零三百多宗咧就係一手樓。

297
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,530
二手樓大約八萬五千六百宗。

298
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:11,590
咁二零一二年咧，一手樓咧就係一萬二千二百宗到，咁二手樓咧就係七萬九千宗。

299
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,750
啊，田北俊議員。

300
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:35,300
係誒，主席，其實我問嘅問題同阿石議員問嘅差唔多，正話政府係解釋第二段嘅文件咧，就話二零一一年嘅成交量啊就跌咗四十二個percent。噉我問佢價錢升咗幾多咧，政府答唔到。劉建兒啊打咗個短信畀我係上高，原來政府公佈咗啊升咗三十四個percent，二零一一年。

301
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:49,590
跌就跌咗成交四十二，價錢起咗三十四。咁一睇咧，成交多咧，主席分明就係二手樓嘅市場啊，就冇人肯放盤，啲地產商就發達啦。我宣佈咗利益㗎，到時我都可能賺多啲㗎啦。

302
00:55:49,870 --> 00:56:00,820
你啲咁咧就整到啲地產價價個卅四個percent大升，咁政府可唔可以具體啲再答一答呢個噉嘅問題啦？我一咁問，二零一一年整體跌咗四十二個percent。

303
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:17,240
地產商嘅一手樓升定跌幾多？二手樓個數量升定跌幾多？我懷疑咧，私家樓啊跌得多嘅，地產商就冇乜跌嘅。你整個三十四個percent咧，就億曬啲發展商。咁要分析啱唔啱咧？

304
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:35,350
係邊位答咧？個成交個分佈，Duncan。Madam Chairman，I'm I'm not sure I have that information with me here. I'm going to have to provide it separately. Okay。啊，有冇人可以，Mr. Wong？Well, he was saying that there was ten thousand, eighty thousand, right? So we could easily see between the first。

305
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:55,820
first一手樓啊，versus the second-hand market，right，that was what you were saying earlier。我哋理緊需處，係我哋理緊需處就係跟嗰個基本上跟個合約裏邊個成交價嚟到去計理緊需，仲冇嗰個升幅嗰個數目字。不過我收樓上一份就係我哋十一月誒係。

306
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:05,050
喺財經事務委員會嗰陣時，政府提交嘅資料嘅，咁當中值到提到，即係我田議員講百分之三十四嗰個比例啦，嗰個係講緊係誒。

307
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:13,490
market即係大約係七十平方米樓下嘅樓宇，即係個升幅嚟嘅，我講。

308
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:19,040
咁而係大超過誒七百平方米嘅升幅係百分之十八噉樣。

309
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,910
依個係舊嘅數字，已經畀過立法會㗎啦。

310
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:30,510
嗯，逃緊新源，佢答唔到嗰個問題。同同意喺呢兩年，因為貨短缺嘅情況之下咧。

311
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,250
地價升得仲急，就益曬啊！一手樓嘅發展商咧。

312
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:55,540
你哋有冇可能就住呢個問題有啲分析comment? Duncan please. Yeah, Madam Chairman, I I don't think you can make quite that direct relationship just because the supply is tight that the price goes down, because there there are so many factors, particularly because the majority of sales actually are second-hand sales, not

313
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,600
第一手 sales。

314
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:16,890
and I think it it is about a willing buyer and a willing seller in the market. If they see the prices are going up for whatever reason, be influx of of money from overseas or whatever, those are all determining factors as to the price. It's not as easy to say there's one cause one effect. So I don't necessarily agree with that. But as I say, we'll go away and we'll produce.

315
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,880
Some more figures for members' consideration. Thank you，啊，陶偉新議員。

316
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:26,950
誒，我我我就都睇埋啲數字咧。不過我初步我個感覺咧，可能真係咧。

317
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:34,310
我我真係要諗清楚咧，其實你依個誒嘅政策咧，可能就係益咗啲發展商，因為啲發展商咧。

318
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:54,630
就因為佢唔需要住啊嘛，佢賣佢鋪招出嚟就係就係就係我嚟賣㗎嘛。噉我價高佢賣咗，佢咪賺賺到笑都合埋嘴咯。但係你普通市民，你話換樓嗰啲你唔換得啦，因為你唔想交個十五啊十個percent啊嘛。咁變咗你就hold起曬咧，就發展商猛賣樓，市民就想換樓啊嗰啲咧，全部咧加埋按揭嗰啲。

319
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:14,640
就唔使諗啦嗱，但係我呢個咧初步，我初步有噉嘅印象。如果我聽完呢個數字，但係我睇過詳細嘅。但係我相信咧，畀啲數字下一次咧就噉樣嗱。附件一啦，呢度咪有誒六個月以下誒或以下六至十、二十至廿四個月啊嘛。咁嗰度可唔可以將佢咧分開兩種數字嚟畀我？阿阿黃生嗰邊税務局就。

320
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,090
點啊！

321
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:35,380
就譬如八啊九噉啊，呢個數字嚇噉，究竟咧誒個價值係幾多？即係用八啊九分翻，譬如誒二千萬以下最好。如果你有嘅誒一千萬幾多宗，一千至二千幾多宗，即係大約因為合理。噉我想睇下咧，會唔會其實啊納呢啲噉嘅十五percent咧？究竟有仲有冇？

322
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:55,390
一個價值嘅區分等等嘅啊，嗰一千五百四十九又係啦。另外咧就係誒，我仲想一個數字咧，就係因為就先咧，你誒阿劉慶元話你下次會誒畀翻我哋咧，就個確認人嘅數目咧，二零一零年咧三千八宗，二零一一年咧就八百八十，二零一二年一至九月就二百五十啊嘛，我阿

323
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:08,040
黃生同我哋講啊嘛，好啦，嗱，我先講二零一一同一二年嗰嗰個八百八十同二百五十，政府就話大量下跌啊嘛，誒下跌咗幾多啊？哇！政府嗰個第二段講啊嘛，下跌咗五啊六percent啊嘛。

324
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:16,380
好啦，咁個問題咧就係呢一個八百八十同二百五十咧，你可唔可以調翻轉由cross tab係？

325
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,960
hold咗幾耐嘅？

326
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:38,800
即係持有咗幾耐，即係八百八十同二百五十係持有咗幾耐嘅。如果你誒二零一零都有個三千八咧，都可以嗱。我點解咁講咧？即係換句話講咧，如果究竟話一個政策成與敗咧，其實可以喺兩邊去拗。但係我就想睇曬啲數字，你有你嘅結論，我有我結論，就我決定。

327
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:54,690
贊唔贊成你？再加我就係要諗呢樣嘢點解咧？嗱，如果你話真係確認人數目減少咗咁多，咁其實即係其實係幾幾有效果喎？嗱，你你如果用翻二零一一年八百八十，噉你即係實施咗B S D咧，就即係啲確認人走鬼曬啦。

328
01:00:54,970 --> 01:01:09,600
噉就得翻九頭九個月二百五十，噉你當乘翻個三個月平均都係三百到啦，係咪？咁即係八百八十同三百啦。好啦，如果個三百又係已經係持有咗幾耐，噉你睇翻咧，你就知道可能根本咧。

329
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:13,640
就佔全部嘅整體幾多咧？

330
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,540
噉我哋就要睇下你個係咪有效咯。

331
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:36,830
咁當然有效，即係所謂百尺竿頭都更進一步啦，係嘛？你話就算你讚我哋好有效，我而家想勁有效喎，噉你咪加好多都得咯。我但係我哋覺得係需唔需要咧？同埋如果嗰啲譬如一旦係involuntary，即係唔唔唔係自願嗰啲，或者有啲好特殊嘅情況，究竟？

332
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:41,340
會唔會就係嗰啲圍豬而產生嘅一啲被逼要畀你嘅數字咧？

333
01:01:42,430 --> 01:02:02,440
同埋推斷究竟cross step之後會唔會就係一手樓就發達發展商？我哋市民換樓或者正常嘅一啲嘅誒誒誒程序啊，譬如有啲可能搬，因為細路想話賣咗呢個區搬去第二區，全部停曬，就但係發展商就繼續賣樓繼續賺錢，係咪我哋依個政策？

334
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,720
會有呢個噉嘅效果，而我哋去到呢個位，係咪仲要繼續？

335
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,830
十五、二十、三十噉樣去咧，嗱呢個我哋係要好小心去考慮啦。

336
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:30,120
係有冇補充？Yes, Madam Chairman. First, we're happy to provide as many statistics as members want. Perhaps the Secretariat can get give us an indication of the of what members desire on statistics, and we'll consolidate a reply. It's probably the best way. But let me let me come back to this point. The objective.

337
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:41,130
Behind special stamp duty is to try and deal with a serious problem at the time, which was an increasing, a substantial increase in short-term speculation and confirmersales.

338
01:02:41,540 --> 01:03:01,550
Our argument is it has been effective, but the effectiveness has diminished. And as we say in paragraph three, you can see that just by the increase in the number of transactions that would be caught by special stamp duty in the period between March and September of last year, the numbers have increased, and the rate of increase is what worries us. You have

339
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,100
要 look at that as the issue.

340
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,920
所以，as far as we're concerned.

341
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,670
the the immediate effect was

342
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:29,340
要take out of the market certainly in the very short term, six months to a year, most of the the short term and almost all of the confirmers sales, but its persistent effect is now under question, and that's what we need to deal with, and so that's what we're trying to do. But we'll we'll come back with statistics. 好，thank you，張宇仁議員。

343
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:39,150
主席，我正正就係想跟問秘書長，就係其實你而家講短期六個月一年呢啲噉嘅措施。

344
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,840
即係佢後尾都認第三段咧，已經講到話已經係逐漸喺度縮減啊，嗰個影響力。

345
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,430
我都想問佢有冇啲譬如三個月啊、六個月啊、九個月，我覺得佢。

346
01:03:50,710 --> 01:04:07,940
其實講短期影響咧，就即係有效咧，就其實唔係講緊一年啊，係講緊三個月。通常咧噏出嚟嚇到人半死，跟住停頓曬。即係而家睇我哋講B.S.D都係十二月，話嗰兩個三個禮拜，跟住即係鬼影都冇隻。

347
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:28,230
跟住咧，而家就話差唔多過緊年都冇人買嘅，都變咗有人出嚟買。咁所以喺噉嘅情形之下，我都想佢一就睇睇啦。二我都想問埋佢，噉你長遠想點咧？呢啲嘢你做完原來一年半載就收工嘅，可以即係都都冇效嘅。噉係咪佢一年半載後又要攬一啲將呢啲噉嘅？

348
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:41,830
嘅誒百分比又要提高，等佢又有多半年有效，定還是佢即係諗住一年半載又唔好做，因為做完一年半載收工啊，還是嗰個效率都唔喺度，即係可唔可以叫佢搭搭啊？

349
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:59,450
Okay, attention, please. Madam Chairman, I I think as I said, we believe that it it is effective, but the persistence of that effect diminishes over time. And indeed, if you look at the way the original special stamp duty was structured, at a falling rate from 15 to 10 to five.

350
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:19,880
the the impact of course will diminish anyway, and what we're saying now is that that impact has diminished. We accept that, and that's why we need to increase the rates. But we also feel that the the the impact within the third year, which did not have a rate before, has has to be added to make sure that it.

351
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:39,890
是個persistent impact， 因為我們真的不想要看到這些短期的Speculators來回市場， 因為我們不保持利率正確。 現在，Buyer Stamp Duty是個完全不同的目標， 它不處理Speculators全部， 那是SST。 Buyer Stamp Duty是打算給優先權給香港買家。

352
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,420
buying property in the market now.

353
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,240
the the question is are Hong Kong buyers

354
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,350
still intending to buy even in this market.

355
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:55,500
因為他們 not affected at all by BSE， and that seems to be the issue at the present time.

356
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:00,160
The question I have to ask myself, and the one that we're studying very closely, is.

357
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:20,550
到什麼 extent， have foreign buyers left the market as a consequence of us announcing BSD， and that's something we're still monitoring at the moment. But we will be we'll be able to give members information on that in due course. 我我只係想問佢嘅主席就係佢佢會幾時將呢啲即係BSC嗰個效力講外國人買。

358
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:40,560
嗰個做得到出嚟咧，佢係咪等我哋立完法制做啊？定係即係而家可以三個月後由公佈可以做到咧？我想知道呢樣嘢，同埋即係而家正正個問題就係佢而家呢條標唔單止淨係影響，即係佢話我唔想影響本地人，但係而家你影響埋啊嘛，因為我本地人用公司買，你唔畀我買，即係你。

359
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:48,740
你要叫我要要要要找找條數啊嘛！嗰度大件事啊嘛！你唔係淨係外國人，你其實本地人公司都影響埋啊嘛！

360
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,970
係，當然。Sorry， again。

361
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,850
There's there's a distinction here between.

362
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:05,810
一 stamp duty which applies to everybody who does a transaction, which is special stamp duty, and it only applies to those people who want to buy and sell quickly.

363
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:26,330
那係的nature of this design。 anyone who wants to buy and sell within six months, twelve months or what have you, doesn't matter if they're local or overseas, they will have to pay because by our definition they are speculators, they are involved in conformer transactions. That's a different issue to buyer stamp duty where.

364
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:46,340
Individual permanent residents holding an ID card are not going to be subject to buyer's stamp duty. It's very different. I think you lose it in the train station. I meant your BSD, not your SSD. Your BSD, you restricted even local citizens using a company. No, well we'll come on to that. That's paragraph five. I just made made the.

365
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:53,690
Comment, but you kind of probably lose it in the translation. 好嘅，OK，啊，胡志偉議員。

366
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,610
代主席。

367
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:15,900
誒，其實我都想係繼續查詢翻，因為睇翻呢個附件二咧，誒，二零一零年嗰個transaction嘅總數就十五萬個啦。我諗我round up條數啦，二零一一年嘅時間咧，個總數就係九十九萬六千個，二零一二年嘅時候九萬一千個。咁二零一零年咧，就當年就有S S

368
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:35,910
啲嘅現造雕咗，即係係引入咗呢個SSD啦。咁頭先我哋同事討論嘅時間，其中一個估算就係話，誒由零一零年到零一年嗰個嘅大幅度嘅係transaction嘅下降咧，可能都係有一個幾大比例嘅原因咧，因為SSD咧係hold咗一啲嘅流語咧，係減少咗佢嗰個volume去買賣嘅情。

369
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:55,920
放嘅噉，但係到二零一一年到一二年嘅時候咧，就進一步再減少咗五個，即係差唔多五千宗嘅。噉，但我又會睇翻就係咧嗰個當年嗰個嘅新樓嗰個係買賣咧，其實即係推出嚟咧有一萬二千，其實多咗兩千個嘅。我其實想問下就係即係誒。

370
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:15,930
部門點樣睇呢啲數字咧？因為誒，你一路就講就係話咧，SSD行咗之後咧，其實個diminishing嘅result。咁如果係有diminishing result嘅話咧，就理論上就應該係當佢越接近呢一個嘅係佢個期滿嘅話咧，嗰個嘅係hold up咗嘅transactions咧，就應該係會。

371
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:24,220
增加翻嘅，咁但係如果睇翻呢個呢一組數字嘅話咧，又似乎唔係噉樣樣嘅走勢喎。噉我想問下你點樣睇同埋點樣解釋咧？

372
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:36,490
係，啊，登近。我

373
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:54,820
represent a simple statement of what were the facts in terms of short-term reselling at those particular points in time. We're not claiming anything other than that. We're not suggesting that there's any particular effect, and it's very very difficult to attribute.

374
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,130
一個直接 consequence。

375
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:17,640
Of special stamp duty to the overall number of sales. We're not claiming that. We're saying if you look at the not the first column but the subsequent columns, it has had an effect on short-term reselling. That's all we're claiming here, because it's gone down from one thousand nine hundred and forty-four in two thousand.

376
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:31,970
10 before the introduction of the special stamp duty to only 17 by 2012. So that's the claim. We're not suggesting that it has any further effect, and indeed it would be dangerous to do so because there are too many different.

377
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:53,160
我想我follow up，多謝曬主席。我想問一問，如果噉樣樣時間，我哋譬如有增加啲新嘅measure咧，其實你有兩個部分，一個就係個rate會increase，一個部分就係嗰個年期會增長。

378
01:10:53,380 --> 01:11:05,800
年期增長噉，如果噉樣諗嘅時間，其實佢嘅實質效果就好低㗎咯。喎，我想係問，即係問一問情況係。 Duncan， please again. I think um our our argument is.

379
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,260
Again, it's set out in paragraph three that although these figures show it has had an effect.

380
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:31,550
overall in decline， the the continuous effect is diminishing because people are now looking at other things that the the value of how quickly the rates go up. so what we're saying is that we're looking at the the rate of increase in the number of short-term transactions and that tells us that the effect is.

381
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,490
diminishing， and that's again that's set out in paragraph three of this paper.

382
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:39,620
噉你點會睇到噉樣？你調整得好吧嚇石禮謙二。

383
01:11:40,470 --> 01:12:00,480
睇一睇呢個表二嗰度咧，因為我心寒啊，主席真係心寒。睇完呢個二零一零年、二零一一年、二零一二年，由十五萬跌到九萬六，跌到九萬一嗰度咧。然後好似頭先啊，天少咁講啦，就係嗰個一路飆上去，三十四個percent average。

384
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:20,490
做喎，如果啲高價樓去到成hundred percent嘅主席，啲我只係頭先講呢個呢個誒太古城啊，太古城係幾耐啊？好好幾十年嘅樓啊，去到二萬。你而家睇到點解喺一個咁供應咁少嘅，而係仲係要去供，係要令到你自己供應。

385
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:40,500
少你仲要喺依個市場嗰度，仲係要令到有個SSD又好BSD好啦，仲要令到依個供應仲更加少，邊個得益啊？主席，我啲選民得益，但係我啲選民唔想咁㗎，我啲選民真係希望一個穩定市場，一個平衡平穩嘅市場。你而家睇到你啲數字攞。

386
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:53,940
嗰表二嗰度嚟睇啊！政府嘅政策係已經失去咗佢嘅能力，係去控制先。佢仲喺度咧，日日話畀人聽。我而家理解到佢講真話，原來睇到依啲噉嘅數字咧，真係大大件事。

387
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:14,230
就係咧，未入黑就見鬼！哇，有好多鬼嚟啊！主席，就逼啲人日日去買樓，供應就唔夠，咁咧個價錢日日升，噉啊嗰啲二手樓咧就今日依個盤，聽日加價，後日又加價，點啊？你睇一睇依啲噉嘅情，依啲咁依依個表啊！主席，哇！我希望長遠。

388
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:22,420
規誒策略委員會啊，係理解到佢要做緊乜嘢，所以點解我哋立法會要要監察就咁？我哋有咁多叻人喺度啊嘛，主席。

389
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:42,840
睇一睇呢啲噉嘅表，依個表咧，你可以睇到點解個價格係升得咁快，而係一個喺一個咁咁供供應咁短缺嘅，政府仲要行依啲噉。好啦，你講公司BSE陣間我講啊，仲有講翻依樣啊，係去到九點六個三percent，噉佢猛嚇香港人咧，話誒。

390
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:58,380
國內啲人嚟買樓，國內啲人嚟買樓啊！買咩樓啫？國內啲人嚟買咩樓喎？你淨係睇睇，用公司都係六九點六三。另外你睇睇啲樓跌到咁犀利，國內人嘅買樓唔係好似佢哋講個咁嚴重性。而家嘅嚴重性係。

391
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:18,670
短缺、短缺、短缺，你而家仲要去撳呢個suppress呢個demand，個demand唔可以suppress到，即係壓縮嗰個誒誒呢個需求嚇。咁咧，你依個依個睇佢依個表咧，我諗大家咧要研究。所以點解個依個如果畀我哋一路通過咗依個依個依個問題咧，睇唔到就今日咧個個都。

392
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:38,680
或者冇食眼啦，主席掛住睇睇呢個文件咧，就叫做透空就唔會眼瞓啦。咁咧就喺睇睇呢度咧，就係睇到呢個成個供應啊，係失調失控咗啦，主席。咁而家要而家咧攞個S S D啊B S D出嚟，都要真要考慮佢個效益喺邊度，好似頭先胡志偉。

393
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:46,100
講個問題啊，陶錦新講個問題，我哋唔好講咩黨派，唔好講咩利益，你淨係睇下市場供應需求，主席。

394
01:14:47,090 --> 01:15:00,770
Okay, Mr. Duncan. Yeah, Madam Chairman, again, I think it's a bit of a stretch to come to those conclusions from Table Two. Table Two actually shows the effectiveness of these of special stamp duty measures.

395
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:16,290
And again, let me let me just refer you to the the effect in the short term. If you look at the the second column down where it says less than twelve less than or equal to 12 months, it's gone from 1,944 transactions.

396
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:24,110
before the introduction of SSD， to 726， and then subsequently last year only 17。

397
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:25,530
There's no doubt.

398
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,240
Special stamp duty has had the effect that we claim for it.

399
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:42,100
The the issue that worries me is is not the immediate effect. It's the persistence of the effect, and that's what this this particular proposal. Which table refer to, chairman? Table two. Table two. Yeah.

400
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,610
啊。

401
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,290
胡志偉議員。

402
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,280
係。

403
01:15:47,010 --> 01:16:07,020
代主席，其實我仍然想跟進翻嗱，即係我哋大家都同意咗一個觀點，就係話S S D個短期效應咧出現咗㗎啦。咁亦都好明顯睇個table二咧，就見到就係佢係真係suppress咗嗰個嘅係transaction嘅情況。咁但係我哋要再即係我哋個電，我我哋諗緊就係如果咧再有de minimus。

404
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,190
result， and等我哋就話extend佢到三年。

405
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:26,800
咁誒，其實你個目標係進，又係會令到就係話咧，而家現有嗰個嘅，即係希望我我唔知我有冇理解錯，就話咧，希望能夠就係透過新嘅一個係措施嘅時候咧，就能夠令到市場上邊嘅transaction。

406
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,790
係會有個減少。

407
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:49,080
我唔知啱唔啱，咁呢第一點。咁第二個就係其實政府想呢啲羣，即係我哋譬如持有物業啦，我哋代即係所謂嘅係中長期持有啦噉樣樣，持有到幾耐我哋先至叫做一個合理嘅時間咧？而家講緊即係大概年幾兩年之後咧，我作為一個業主嘅持有人，我就可能因為作

408
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,410
種唔同嘅理由，可能重新會思考，就係我willingness to sell。

409
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:13,930
咁而家就係咪政府係想就話再進一步將呢一個我work to sell呢一樣嘢咧，就再推到喺兩年半或三年之後先至去諗咧噉樣樣。咁如果係嘅時候，呢一個我諗同啲同事講嗰樣嘢，你事實上真係壓縮緊整體嗰個市場上邊嘅一個係誒潛在嘅流與供應，大家。

410
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:33,940
嗰個嘅係即係supply and demand嗰個嘅係market movement嘅喎，咁所以我我其實唔係好掌握就話成個成個諗法咧。第一，我哋同意咗佢短期效應存在咗啦，OK啦，已經做好咗啦。咁但係你要進一步將呢個嘢推出去嘅時間，你想達到嘅效果係咩嘢咧？你點樣能夠證明到就係你新推出去嘅時間就？

411
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:43,950
達到你個效果，你個效果係係啲你想extend到幾一一個幾大嘅係即係mechanism或者一個幾大嘅momentum先至叫做達至目標咧。我想知道呢一點，多謝主席。

412
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:55,360
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I think perhaps there's a an issue here about what is the effect of special stamp duty. First, it only applies.

413
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:03,690
從一個預設日期，另一個詞，people buy knowing that there will be certain restrictions in terms of additional stamp duty payable.

414
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,660
所以， anyone who who has bought before that, it's not affected.

415
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:16,180
Okay, so really, what we're saying is, you need to know that if you're going to sell something within six months or a year or whatever, you will pay this extra amount.

416
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:23,960
from our perception is that it actually stops people who intend to sell quickly going into the market.

417
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:30,910
所以，它不，它應該不影響總數量的交易。如果你接受，那那是邏輯，是它運作的方式。

418
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,140
因為，佢哋簡直唔喺市場度。

419
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:54,790
and we believe that that is the fact that we believe that's the effect. In other words, it doesn't stop people who already have property from selling, but it stops people buying into the market with a view to selling quickly, because that sort of very quick resale doesn't actually help increase the supply, because it's just one flat that may be traded three or four.

420
01:18:54,790 --> 01:19:06,500
times in the space of six to eight months. That's that's not an additional supply. It's one flat. So what we're saying is that we want to make sure that people still resist going into the market.

421
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:23,460
因為他們不 anticipate being able to get out of it without paying the special stamp duty，所以 it's a different concept to the one that you're saying， where we're trying to restrict the market。 we're not， we're just trying to prevent people thinking that they can buy in and sell quickly and make a quick profit。 that's the objective。

422
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,390
圖緊新業。

423
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:32,830
誒主席，就誒嗰個NXB嗰度咧，我想誒提一個觀點啦，亦都等政府婉彌佢回應啦。

424
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:35,480
其實呢個係鞏固，就先我。

425
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:44,430
誒較早前嗰個發言嘅觀點嗱，你二零一零年NXP嗰度咧，就係總共咧就係有十五萬五啦。

426
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:59,790
咁二零一零年咧，據我瞭解咧，嗰個一手樓咧，即係十五萬五裏邊咧，大約係一萬到嗱。我希望王局長可以，因為佢頭先冇講呢個數字嘅。不過我瞭解應該係一萬到嘅。咁二零一一年咧，九萬六裏邊咧。

427
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:18,390
就係全部啦，一手樓咧就一零三零零啊嘛！阿王局長話，到到二零一二年咧就九九萬一啦，又係萬嗱仲多咗啊，萬一二二零零嗱好啦，即係換講你你諗下，二零一零年十四萬就係二手樓成交。

428
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:20,990
一萬就一手樓。

429
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:24,740
到到一一年咧，係八萬幾係二手樓。

430
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,310
然後咧，一手樓咧就一萬，仍然一萬。

431
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:43,670
二零一二年咧，又係啦，八萬到就係誒七萬幾添啊，就係誒二手，然後一手樓一萬。我哋諗下，即係一手樓佔嗰年嘅全部成交咧。

432
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,000
係上升得好犀利喎！

433
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:53,750
即使你係嗰個B.S.D.啊S.S.D.嗱個原因係咩咧？個原因咧就係個價一路升。

434
01:20:54,140 --> 01:21:07,610
即係換句話講，我懷疑啊嗱，所以我繼續問，跟住問個問題咧，就係嗰啲當時上一次SSD嘅委員會嘅時候咧，全部地產代理係有一個觀點，佢話嗰啲換樓嗰啲咧，全部冇得換啦。

435
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:11,860
因為你換你你賣咗你嗰個舊嘅二手樓，再買翻新嗰個咧。

436
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,640
你分分鐘咧，仲貴咗。

437
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:34,930
如果你係喺二零一零年十一月之後再買入而想換樓咧，根本就重大喎。尤其是如果你廿四個月咁好啦。如果而家加長咗，阿胡志偉所講咧，你加到卅六個月，即係換句話講，你呢兩三年買樓嗰啲咧，你三年內你都一定唔會換樓。換句話嚟講，你lock死咗某一啲嘢咧，當然你話住長啲好啊。

438
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:39,510
但係實際上咧，因為佢換樓咧，佢都係掉翻一啲供應咧喺個市場啊。

439
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:49,380
死火啦！即係換句話講咧，嗰啲唔使買換唔係換樓喎，因為發展商塊地起咗樓就賣畀你啦嘛。咁嗰啲個價喺度升，佢咪賺咯。

440
01:21:49,660 --> 01:22:09,670
但係嗰啲換樓嗰啲咧做唔到，但係佢就令到嗰個供應咧二手樓嘅掉出市場嘅供應咧大大減低。呢個就中咗S S D委員會上兩年嗰啲嚟發表意見嘅人咧，全部都係咁講。我嗰陣時咧半信半疑，但係而家咧。

441
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,810
原來係證實佢完全係中曬嘅。

442
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:21,730
嗱，噉我想問嘅數字係咩咧？就係我唔知道得唔得。嗱，你揾揾到或者揾唔到啦嚇，我都我都試下叫我助手去誒去run一啲噉嘅數字，就係。

443
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,640
喺實施SSD之前。

444
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:27,650
二零一一零年十一月之前。

445
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,170
有幾多係？

446
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,510
誒。

447
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:48,010
換樓嘅，即係換句話講咧，會唔會係用一個透過嗰個誒查誒，譬如誒個人，我當個人先啦，唔好講公司啦，嗰十percent唔計先啦。佢係賣咗層樓，你一個framework撳個電腦，佢又跟住又再買買一層樓嘅。

448
01:22:48,290 --> 01:23:00,930
或者調翻轉，可能佢買一層樓先，然後佢掟佢舊嗰層樓出嚟市場。即係換句話講咧，嗰兩個買賣咧係會喺某一個時間就賣或者買，買或者賣，係同一個人或者同一一組人嘅。

449
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,370
噉就睇到咧嗰個。

450
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:22,220
而家實施咗啦，可能根本就冇人掟出市場啊！因為根本大家停曬換樓啦，啊咁於是咧個情況咧就變咗，係真係個供應咧呢個證明到咧就係一一年、一二年咧，其實係嗰啲舊樓、二手樓係冇人換樓、冇人掟出去市場供應。

451
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,590
我唔知可唔可以做到啊？黃生嗰邊做唔做到呢個exercise？

452
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:34,740
誒，anyone？然後黃生或者係登琴兩個問題咧。第一個問題，數目字嗰度可以現場就畀翻啊。

453
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,930
議員嘅，即係話二零一零年。

454
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:41,600
嘅一手樓個成交數量。

455
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,260
就係一萬二千六百幾宗，幾差唔多，即係。

456
01:23:46,540 --> 01:24:06,550
十另外二手樓成交就十四萬三千宗度，咁加埋就十五萬五千宗啊。呢個就係個數目，自我哋收樓上有嘅。至於誒委員剛才想問話，我哋有冇誒一啲資料或者啲數據？有啲人係換樓嘅，咁誒我哋嗰個物業税成交嗰個資料庫就唔係噉樣去。

457
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:13,440
誒記錄嗰啲資料嘅啊，所以就做唔到嗰樣嘢。睇下佢咪先買後賣，或先買後買噉樣呢樣嘢嘅。

458
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:21,520
主席咁run都唔得咧。譬如你當一個X一個三蚊紙號碼，即係你唔係我我唔係要嗰啲資料私隱咧，即係喺個幾多volume啫。

459
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:29,750
係佢，譬如回籤三年裏邊有買賣過樓宇，有有賣過有買過嘅，咁當係一組咁抽出嚟得唔得？

460
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,500
照計應該唔會多嘅。

461
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:52,900
Chairman, I I don't think, as far as I know, because we've we've tried to find this information ourselves, I don't think that information is available. But in any case, it's it's a very difficult leap to say that because people are not buying into the market, which is the intention of SSD, then people are not selling. I don't.

462
01:24:52,900 --> 01:25:12,910
I don't think that's the way it works. There are so many other factors, many more factors that are much more important than SSD into this concept of willing buyer, willing seller. Price is one of them, but there are other issues. Confidence in the marketplace, etc., etc. The need to buy. I don't really think that you can make the link that the honourable member.

463
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:32,920
唔係主席，如果你用同一個邏唔係主席同一個邏輯啊，即係換句話講，你而家所有啲分析都係都都都係靠估㗎啦。你你一定要攞到啲如果有呢啲數字，你攞到啲數字，然後每一個人係你可以判斷呢啲數字同咩因素有關咧，係可以有。

464
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:41,170
嗰仲仲可以有啲基礎嚟到大家討論啊嘛！你如果冇啲數字，根本乜都冇啦。討厭嘅意見你聽到，希望你盡力配合阿登勤。

465
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:54,440
作為我説，我認為最重要的一件事係：，什麼是總數量的交易涉及特別印花税？，這表示數量的人買進在短期內，而願意賣。

466
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:06,670
all the rest of the people clearly are not getting affected by special stamp duty. That's the you know the 95,000 odd are not getting affected by stamp duty. That's the bigger message here.

467
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:11,170
not the small number that are affected by special stamp duty.

468
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,960
我哋知嘅。

469
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,670
就S S D呢？

470
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,470
我哋要諗咧，主要嘅原因就係。

471
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:23,000
而家樓價係不受控制飆升。

472
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:32,900
兩年前嘅S S D，我哋就係一針對呢個問題去處理嘅。而家再加辣嘅S S D。

473
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:36,690
因為呢個成效不彰，而家啦。

474
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,490
喺呢個樓價飆升嘅問題上面。

475
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,950
究竟？

476
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:46,270
係因為短期嘅炒嘅原因咧。

477
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,150
還是係。

478
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:51,040
由於土地供應不足。

479
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,670
出現供求嘅失衡。

480
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:56,990
嚇！求過於公。

481
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:02,820
而導致樓價飆升咧，呢個咧我係仲係考慮當中。

482
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:05,290
或者係咪兩個原因都有？

483
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,330
係咪兩個原因都有？

484
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,740
孰重孰輕？

485
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:14,560
邊個原因導致呢個樓價飆得咁緊要？

486
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:25,230
所以呢樣嘢咧，我哋實行而家第二期嘅S S D，就要審慎考慮呢個問題。

487
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:28,450
同樣面對樓價飆升。

488
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:32,480
我哋有提出另外一個因素咧。

489
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,380
就外來嘅買家，非本港居民嘅買家。

490
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,550
喺市場上面。

491
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,830
佔嘅份額好大。

492
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:47,690
所以嚟到呢度咧，利用佢哋嘅遊資。

493
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:52,370
抬高咗樓價，亦都令樓價飆升。

494
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:58,200
究竟呢個原因係噉樣樣啊，還是亦都係？

495
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:00,500
供求失衡。

496
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:05,520
啊！求過，求過於公。

497
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:14,760
咁於是咧，令到樓價又飆升。兩大因素嘅情況下，令到樓價飆升，所以我哋搞個B S T嘅咧。

498
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:19,300
所以，我從附件二。

499
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:21,440
個。

500
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:34,560
數字裏面咧，我係睇唔到有啲嘢。頭先阿税局局長咧就誒，阿王局長嗰度咧就誒提出一個數字咧，我好有興趣。我希望你補充一份資料畀我哋。

501
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,210
就係依照附件二嗰個格式。

502
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:45,750
A科林同埋B科林裏面咧，係有幾多新嘅樓盤？

503
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:54,130
有幾多係二手樓？我希望你係分列出嚟。頭先你讀嘅數字係有嘅。

504
01:28:54,410 --> 01:29:07,580
但係就冇表列出嚟。我想睇下究竟係供求關係啊，還是係純粹短期炒，或者外來外來人炒而導致嘅樓價飆升。

505
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:13,320
我分析唔到喺呢個誒附表二裏邊，我睇唔到呢啲數字。

506
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:22,370
我相信咧，誒你你哋如果有呢啲數字提供畀我咧，我可以再再詳細去思考一下。

507
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:43,130
可否提供登記？Please yes, we will follow up on that information and provide the statistics you ask for. And I I don't disagree with you. There are there are a number of issues relating to the effect of the market. Some of it is a supply side. That's the number of units. But of course you have to also bear in mind the influx of capital from overseas. That's another issue. You have

508
01:29:43,130 --> 01:30:03,140
have to bear in mind the willingness of of people to sell because you know they're sitting on a place they're living there they don't have to sell you can't the government can no one else can force people to sell their own property and that's another issue so there are as you quite rightly say many different reasons why this market is is in the state that it's in and what we're trying to do through

509
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:10,190
BSD is deal with one of those factors, and that's the influx of overseas money, and that is certainly a significant effect.

510
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:15,510
我我唔係好同意阿Den所講嘅。

511
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:20,200
如果我相相處嘅朋友裏邊咧，

512
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:27,260
佢覺得而家呢個價錢咧，我賣樓，我賣咗之後，我出去租仲抵。

513
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:33,950
租一段時間，等個樓市順翻，我再再買翻嚟自住啊！

514
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:41,780
嚇！就海怡半島嘅啲朋友啊，佢話而家個價錢好好好好諗得過啊，喳喳林賣咗。

515
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,560
啊！吹出面粥。

516
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,150
佢等個海，等樓價順翻嘅時候咧，佢先再買翻。

517
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:54,520
咁所以咧，就你話你話而家個樓市噉樣飆升咧，就係引人。

518
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:58,910
出去炒，引人出去喺呢個。

519
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:02,720
情況下咧，作為一個誒誒誒。

520
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,820
即係食雞。

521
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,390
獲取利利益嘅機會啊！

522
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,630
謝偉全議員。

523
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,990
誒主席，主席我咪有三分鐘㗎？係冇錯。

524
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:27,920
誒，頭先我想跟進翻我之前問咧，因為睇嗰個附件一咧，睇到個税率咧，就似乎畀我感覺就最有效啦。因為你個税率如果百分之五嘅時候咧，似乎個成交個案相對嚟講係好多嘅。

525
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:38,150
咁頭先我成日望想問咧，即係呢個物業持有期方面咧，而家就建議咧要畀呢個特啲額外印花税咧。

526
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:40,510
爭到呢個三啊六個月。

527
01:31:41,140 --> 01:32:01,150
咁但係呢度又冇數字咧，就係咪好多即係係買賣咧？就係買咗之後咧，三十六個月之內咧，喺即係廿四個月至三十六月個月之內咧去買賣嘅。因為我會擔心咧，即係個數字其實對而家建議方面咧，將個物業持有期咧延長嗰方面咧，對將來個。

528
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:21,160
供應啊，供應方面會唔會影響？因為其實我睇到係最主籍啊，最最主要嗰個就税率嘅問題啊嘛。你個有效呢十五個percent、十個percent嗰啲數字好低嘅，五個percent咧，而家就話咧嗰個有個趨勢喺度加啊嘛。噉你依個建議咧，其中就已經係將佢增加呢個税率。

529
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:41,170
咁點解又增加年期咧？係咪就話諗到一五年嘅時候美國會加税，所以又想唔唔打擊啲人去買咧？一或係咩理由我唔知，因為我好擔心咧，就係話你如果噉樣落去咧，即係唔想人哋買咧，就變咗，因為而家二手樓方面嗰個供應咧就跌啊嘛，你睇。

530
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:56,740
數字睇到啦，個二手樓嘅買賣啊，一手樓基本上過去呢幾年就冇乜點樣變化，或者有少少升添。呢個係供應嘅問題。咁二手樓根本係個鋪喺度噉，個個係有咁多百幾萬間喺度，點解會少咗咧？噉樣。

531
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:06,850
由由由，你睇翻嗰個附表二嗰個啊，由十誒誒誒呢個誒二千萬以下嗰啲十五萬幾咧，跌到九萬幾八萬幾。

532
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:15,330
噉我我唔知點解會即係因為咁咧？點解個理由？所以我想攞數字係噉嘅先，點解會延長到三十六個月？

533
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,990
單根。

534
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:38,520
I I mean agree with you that the the rate the percentage of SSD has a diminishing effect, and certainly at five per cent it really doesn't seem to have the effect that we anticipated when we put it in place in the first place, and that's exactly why we want to increase the rate. So I agree with you on that.

535
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:58,530
Unfortunately, I check we don't because we don't have to. We don't record the number of sales transactions that take place beyond twenty four months to thirty six months. It's not required for special stamp duty at the moment. But actually, as we've indicated in the paper, the purpose is to is to give a message to.

536
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:17,680
the marketplace that we really do not want to encourage people to get into the market with a short-term mentality, that you know they get in and they sell quickly. We think the short-term sort of time frame that we're talking about is up to three years now, not two years, simply because we know that

537
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:38,030
The two-year rates, as I've indicated here, the rate between one year to two years, the number of transactions has been increasing dramatically, and we feel that that's that's that's something we do want to tackle. And to do that, we have to extend the period. So that's the logic behind this.謝袁。Madam Chairman, actually, I don't see.

538
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:41,640
what is the magic of you know picking up thirty six months?

539
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:46,750
That's why exactly why I'm trying to ask. What's the rationale behind?

540
01:34:47,030 --> 01:35:07,040
There must be you know some sort of research or justification for you to extend the holding period from the existing twenty four months up to thirty six months. That's exactly I'm trying to drive at. Yeah, I and I understand the point. And as I say, I think what we're what we're saying is that it's based on our.

541
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:27,050
我理解到當前市場情況，which it has to be， that the 5% rate from 12 months to 24 months has had no effect. So the first thing we have to do is increase the rate. But we're also concerned that the period from up to 24 months to 36 months will increase.

542
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:44,000
the impact of the special stamp duty and that's the objective. That's the logic of that extra expense. As I said here, we want to give a further disincentive for speculators to get into the market at all, because they know that they'll have to hold it for longer, and that's the objective.

543
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:46,200
石禮謙議員。

544
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:50,270
誒主席，即係你睇一睇啦。

545
01:35:50,570 --> 01:36:01,390
就係成個，就算係S S D啦，加埋曬喺依廿四個月，好就一千九百三十六個。

546
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,950
喺嗰個整體嗰個交易咧。

547
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:25,240
係少到好少。你再去再去睇一睇咧，佢加埋都係三億元嗰個duty，三億元喺嗰個成交買賣樓個成交咧，係真係唔係咁重要。但係個S S D個重要係頭先Mr. Presser講得啱，係畀到人一個信心，驚啦。越驚咧就。

548
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:45,250
越賣樓，頭先佢又講個SSD唔影響大家，但係SSD咧就影響到咧供應流於喺度。而家睇到成個情況，好啦，你再去加三個六個月，三十六個月，好似頭先啊啊啊啊啊謝議員講咧，你依三十六個月未來你睇一睇啦，二零一零年、二零一

549
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:53,700
一年，我阿陶錦生我哋都講喺度坐喺度都講，你冚唪唥咧嗰個新嘅樓宇入嚟咧，係萬一至萬二嘅啫。

550
01:36:53,980 --> 01:37:13,990
嚇！你由十四萬跌到去八萬八萬幾，跟住咁跌咧，然後咧新樓入嚟咧，主席未來嗰兩兩年啊，一二零一一三年咧都係萬三四嘅個，都比你都萬四個啦。再加埋咧，二零一五年萬五個，去到二零一六年啦，而家所有。

551
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:34,000
我哋賣嘅地咧，係唔能高價啲麪粉啦。麪粉賣好多地啦，咁一啲麪粉賣嘅地咧，而家你嗰個供應量咧，就喺二手樓嗰度。而家我有一百二十萬嘅二手樓業主喺度，咁咧，但係依一百二十萬嘅業主咧，就係只係咧，就畀佢哋去睇到，因為依個S S C驚住。

552
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:54,010
依個S.S.D咧，佢哋換唔到樓，又買唔到樓，咁冚棒唥越嚟越整咧個供應咧就越嚟就越少落去。睇翻佢依個pattern啊，主席，再加翻咧喺新樓嗰度咧一路咁加，所以你係新樓一路咁谷個價錢一路上去，點解啊？個個好新樓谷價嘅錢上去咧，就反映到政府。

553
01:37:54,010 --> 01:38:14,020
政府嘅地價，主席，你睇翻個政府地價，所以成個政府嘅premium死都唔肯去減低嘅咧，因為佢有高地價政策喺度啊，主席。所以佢成日啲人話：，哇，啲地產商，但係你睇一睇個地產商，佢每一年嘅供應都係咁多，因為佢只係可以買到啲麵粉啊嘛，佢越麵粉越少嘅供應，你睇到呢個表。

554
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:17,150
二咧，你可以睇你心寒，所以我希望咧，主席。

555
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:37,790
攞翻個表二嗰度咧，去再重整下，唔係淨係睇二零一零年，我哋睇一睇翻二零零五年開始嗰個成總個成交率，去去一路咁去新樓舊樓新樓舊樓噉樣，你又睇到佢個公喺個成個情況咧，我哋都係房依個房屋啊各方面去睇依個咧，主席就係。

556
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:46,140
睇到佢咧，真正依個出嗰個問題出咗喺邊一度？而家依而家你講呢個SST三十六個月。

557
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:58,560
帶嚟個影響係幾大？依個影響咧就係又又repeat翻咧，我哋早嗰幾年嘅問題，主席。即係依個係對香港個好大好大嘅個誒考驗喺度，主席。

558
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:07,520
係可否提供資料同埋any comment？Madam Chairman, of course, we'll we'll try and provide that information. But let me say.

559
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:13,780
that the purpose of SSD is to stop these people getting into the market at all.

560
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:34,240
所以，的 consequence of them not being in the market just means that we don't have these short-term resells which are not helping anybody as an end user. The whole purpose of having SSD is to give priority to end users, people who are going to buy and hold on to it for five, ten, fifteen years because they're using it. That's, I think we've

561
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:54,250
Got to keep that target firmly in mind when we discuss this issue, because SSD is designed to deal with those people who never had any intention of holding on. The chairman, that this is not what your original idea was. Your original idea was to suppress speculation. I mean, your paragraph too. Read what you.

562
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:58,330
有個段落，完全不同於你剛才説的。

563
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:18,680
If you if if that is your objective, you even fail more, even fail more. To that extent, that you are restricting, you are restricting demand. How can you suppress demand? You can suppress demand over very short time, but you cannot suppress demand over a long period of time. Then you completely break down the whole confidence.

564
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:38,690
I mean, this is. But then, on one hand, government saying that we don't have enough land to build more, so that people can buy more. See in his policy speeches, buy, buy, buy. I help you to buy, but we don't have enough land. But look at this, nothing from you are actually preventing people from buying. This is the whole essence.

565
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:55,620
Again, I really don't agree with that. What we're trying to do is to stop those people who are speculators. Very clear target. Speculating 1,900 out of 160,000. Maybe you have to wait for another turn.阿田不進議員。

566
01:40:55,980 --> 01:41:13,200
誒主席啊，即係難怪呢排嘅政府咧，好似個公信力就差咗啲啦。即係你做任何嘢咧，我覺得你應該深思熟慮，即係有信於民先得㗎。你睇啲投資者，你哋話廿四個月。

567
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:20,730
之後咧，你賣我就唔收你税啦。咁可能有啲人就基於噉嘅理由去買咗啲樓嚟收租，佢唔係炒家嚟㗎喎。

568
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:23,470
咁政府忽然間你話改過卅六。

569
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:43,760
咁市民我都唔知信定唔信喎。不如明年佢話唔掂，三十六個月咧又變四廿八，後年四廿八變六十。我相信Mister Prescott唔敢話喂，絕對唔會做呢樣嘢，因為特首仲有啲嘢話到時啊，近辣嘅招啊嘛。噉你係咪失信於民咧？如果你咁做法，嗱。

570
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:50,700
貴政府所有個施政都有問題喎。咁講翻呢一範啦，主席個投資者都有佢個保障啊。

571
01:41:51,180 --> 01:42:11,190
我啲個法律顧問有冇研究過嗰啲投資者可唔可能去告政府？因為你話咗廿四個月，我係基於你廿四個月我去投資嘅，希望廿六個月、廿七個月唔係短期㗎咯，唔算做炒家咯，仲話我賣出去而家忽然間變咗卅六個法律嗰邊。

572
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:15,080
我哋嘅法律基礎穩唔穩定嘅咧？係冇追索力㗎嘛，Duncan。

573
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:33,080
回應到那，Madam Chairman，the the law is prospective， so anyone who's already in， that is already only subject to the 24 months。 We can't change that。 We don't intend to change that。 It's a message for future buyers to say， look， if you buy at this particular time after the law is enacted， then you'll face a

574
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:41,670
這些利率過36個月，但 existing buyers who already bought under the old SSD regime has no effect on them.

575
01:42:42,930 --> 01:43:02,940
啊！多謝澄清，我都冇搞清楚啲點，即係話以前做咗嗰啲係廿四個走得，你講呢個最近實施咗幾個要高係就係最近嘅喺公佈日之後成交嘅單位先至會係三，即係先至會application rate。咁如果將嚟又再公佈個新嘅四廿八，都係嗰陣時開始。係啦，冇錯。OK。

576
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:09,590
我瞭解係咪？Donald，is it correct? Well, Madam Chairman, I can give you an absolute guarantee. I am not working on 48 months.

577
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:11,640
Absolutely not.

578
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:15,560
O.K. 啊，胡志偉議員。

579
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:21,450
誒，代主席，我想問一個重要性，就係即係S S D。

580
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:41,980
特別印花税咧，其實就一路有兩個元素，一個就係嗰個誒印花税嘅税率，另一個就係個年期。我想問下咧，其實即係局方有冇做過一啲嘅係即係類似係經濟嘅模型啊，評估過就係話其實即係你引入咗呢啲新嘅係。

581
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:45,430
係税率同埋嗰個嘅係即係年期咧。

582
01:43:45,740 --> 01:44:05,750
佢嗰個效應係點樣樣咧？如果兩年從上一次嘅經驗，兩年就嚟咗呢個時間差唔多，就冇乜效果嘅時間。咁三年嘅效果其實又會點啊？你點點樣評估咧？會唔會有一個好基準咧？等大家都會知道就話，我哋係要建基於一個咩基礎去評估就話及。

583
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:12,130
究竟三年嗰個所謂嘅效果係咪真係會好過兩年？呢個兩噉。

584
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:32,420
噉我哋都大家有個有有個睇法，就話會知道究竟個目標係邊一樹啊嘛。想問下，其實部門或者政府有冇做過呢一方面嘅評估？你預期就話三年達到嗰個成效係點樣樣嘅一回事？係有冇做評估？Thank you, please, yes. In fact, we haven't done a projection of the effect because, as I said, our our now

585
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:37,210
分析是基於當前的影響， of the two years and the current rates.

586
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:42,000
and indeed it's actually extremely difficult to do something like that because

587
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:50,970
因素 that affect the market are often external. For example, if in Washington they decide to put interest rates up.

588
01:44:51,410 --> 01:45:01,300
Then interest rates will increase here, and it will have a huge effect on people's ability to purchase because their mortgage rates will go up and so on and so forth.

589
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:18,140
You just have to look at recent history. The Americans introduced quantitative easing, and that one of the results of that was a huge influx of of money looking for places to make a profit. Because there's no interest if you just put it in the bank, you're going to invest in

590
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:38,430
commodities properties shares where you think you're going to get the best interest and in Hong Kong, it's been a good return on investment. There's no doubt about it. So there are too many factors which we can't control to be able to anticipate. So we took the other view, which is look, has the current rates have the current rates and the current durations

591
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:44,360
had its effect and as I said earlier, there's no doubt that 15% and 10% has a good effect.

592
01:45:44,700 --> 01:46:04,710
但5%其實並未有我們想要的效果，就係持續讓消費者留在市場。所以我們認為10%的税率，以現有的例子來説，是我們能夠產生顯著效果的最低税率，讓消費者有購買的動機。

593
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:12,100
term periods， and then the 36 months will basically again. It's about giving a strong message that if you buy into a market.

594
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:28,490
the current stage, which is you know volatile and what have you, you need to know that if you want to sell it for speculative purposes, you're going to really have to face these charges for a longer period. So it's a slightly different approach, rather than looking forward and trying to anticipate the effect.

595
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:35,800
好，咁跟住到我提問啦。誒，我聽咗咁多位議員誒發表意見啦。

596
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:47,160
我諗最初政府提呢個特別印花税咧，就係想打擊炒賣嘅。咁從數字上咧，N S A咧，我就認為係成功嘅。

597
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:52,330
但係咧，你而家發展到咧，議員都係講得有道理嘅。其實你去到，

598
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:58,810
二十四個月，咁而家到到再申延到三十六個月咧。簡單嚟講，其實就唔係打擊。

599
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:19,100
短期炒埋，其實連投資咧，即係其實講真，三十六個月都已經係一個好合理嘅投資時段啦，係嘛？税局當係啊trading啊，我理解都係兩年裏邊兩年裏邊轉售先有可能係會被視為係誒貨買賣啦。三十六個月係合理投資噉，而家你其實增加咗佢嘅。

600
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,540
投資成本。

601
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:33,730
咁喺供應短缺底下咧，我都理解你呢個考慮。但係頭先議員提嘅一點咧，我我唔知你可唔可以再進一步回應咧？就係其實誒誒，而家你增加到三十六個月。

602
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:41,500
啊，噉就加重咗個投資成本啦。但係另一個議員擔心嘅問題就係會唔會因為增加咗呢一個？

603
01:47:42,120 --> 01:48:02,130
投資成本咧，而導致到嗰個供應量嚇供應量其實係短缺，咁供應量短缺即係進一步令到個樓價上升，噉啊，其實就幫唔到個市民啦。頭先講咗咁耐就係講緊呢樣嘢啊嘛。噉我自己喺度諗啊，其實你令到個供應量短缺嗰啲單位咧，就係誒誒。

604
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:04,360
宣佈買家印花税。

605
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:25,350
之後嗰啲買賣就會令到佢可能有個誒hesitation去去買啦，係嘛？其他其他喺誒呢個税例生效前嘅理論上，如果佢要賣嚇，唔會有呢個誒影響㗎嘛？係咪咁？所以理論上受影響或者即係所謂會。

606
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:28,490
誒影響到。

607
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:49,130
賣家嘅意欲咧就係九萬六再加九萬一啦，咁未計你二零一零年十一月生效之前啦，即係十八萬幾個，比對起你而家百幾萬係嘛，百幾萬嘅誒私樓單位理論上就唔算一個大數目嘅，咁同埋我自己諗咧，呢一啲人咧新新買樓噉佢都知。

608
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:53,460
知道有買家印花税，咁政府希望佢自住。

609
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:56,050
用嚟作自住用途噉。

610
01:48:56,360 --> 01:49:03,770
咁合理當然我哋好難判斷兩年三年係咪合理，但係即係某個程度上我都會接受就係誒呢啲人新買嘅。

611
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:11,120
佢可能喺投嗰兩三年咧，誒，若然唔係諗住投資咧，佢繼續住嘅意欲係會高嘅。

612
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:14,420
喺噉嘅程度上咧，我自己就覺得。

613
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:20,080
呢個呢個呢個觀點，你哋可以諗一諗。不過，我想問一問咧，就N.S.A.嗰度。

614
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:40,370
即係其實你哋有冇瞭解過咧？喺誒特別印花税生效之後，仍然去賣樓，即係仍然要畀你一個特別印花税。佢梗係覺得一係就真係好需要賣啦，一係咧就係佢誒升嘅幅度已經冚過咗佢呢一個特別印花税嘅幅度，所以佢根本冇所謂啦。賺咗咪賺少啲咯。你哋有冇瞭解過呢啲嘅？

615
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,070
誒買。

616
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:55,510
即係呢啲transaction佢嘅背後嗰個啊買樓嘅誒理念係乜嘢咧？雖然我知可能好難啦，有有冇幾多個向你哋求情話要求豁免呢啲誒特別印花税嘅咧？

617
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:04,190
我我問Mr. Wong to answer the last one, but can I make a couple of points? Okay. The the question of the number of sellers.

618
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:06,440
其實，你唔可以。

619
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:26,830
say that the number of transactions relates to the number of sellers, because of course you do have a phenomenon of people putting their property on the market, test the market, they don't sell it, they take it off. Maybe a few months later they put it back on the market, they take it off. They would count two or three times if we were to look at the number of sellers. What we might be able to do is give you a snapshot.

620
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:46,840
你冇資料咧，NSA嗰啲。

621
01:50:46,840 --> 01:51:06,850
負責主席係誒N.S.A.裏邊咧，就係依啲係係誒，佢哋冇反對徵收呢個額外印花税嘅個案嚟嘅。咁有一部分咧，就係喺法例係豁免，佢唔需要交呢個額外印花税嘅。例如即係近親之間嘅轉讓啦，噉我收錄上就暫時冇呢個記錄嚇。

622
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:22,520
噉我哋就係去買賣嗰陣時或者轉讓嗰陣時，係跟翻印花税條例裏邊嘅情況之下，可以被豁免呢個印花税，所以就唔需要交嘅。好少嘅啫，嗰部分係嘛？對唔住，好少嘅啫嘛，數量誒唔會太多嚇。

623
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:43,190
Madam Chairman, maybe I can respond on a couple of your other points. This this issue of increasing the investment cost, as I've tried to explain, that is deliberately targeted at what we call the speculators. We're trying to tell them, look, if you invest, the cost to you of selling in the short term.

624
01:51:43,190 --> 01:52:00,560
is going to be higher than if you hang on to it for the longer term, and this this then comes back to what is the appropriate length of time for people to be, in a sense, affected by these additional rates. It is it is clear from the the information we've provided that

625
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:13,660
The rates are an important factor, but also the duration, and that's why in this case we want to address both of those issues based on experience with the existing SSD, because clearly.

626
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:34,260
in in investment terms, if at the end of the day, the rate of increase in a in a particular market is greater than the additional cost that government levies on you, then you may as well sell, and not regard the cost as as an impediment. So the cost has got to be sufficiently high to have the effect that we want to do.

627
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,280
那係真係，我哋嚟緊嘅。

628
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,600
途緊新言。

629
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:41,760
誒，主席，我想問一問咧，就係。

630
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:49,010
嗱誒，譬如如果二零一零年啊，嗰個十二月買啦，當啊～

631
01:52:49,290 --> 01:53:09,300
噉你就原上誒誒原本嗰個S S D，而家實行嗰個就要生效啦。即係如果係誒計廿四個月計，咁但係如果呢個改咗呢個三十六個月咧，係咪佢哋不受影響㗎？我我問一問呢個技術，我等我知道嗰個實行係點先。I I in fact I have answered that question already. It is a prospective law. You can't apply it retrospectively.

632
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:29,310
即係買賣誒，應該係措施公佈之後買入的嚇，係啦，計起三十六個月啊嘛，係啦，冇錯。They they will know when they buy what the the the legal liability might be. You can't you can't change the legal liability halfway through. That's not reasonable. So we're not doing that at all.

633
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:31,280
O.K.嗱，誒。

634
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,870
我用另一誒，我表達一個觀點啊，就咧誒。

635
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,800
究竟一個人佢誒？

636
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,260
持有廿四個月啦，因為你而家改咗廿四變去卅六啊嘛。

637
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:48,400
廿四個月以後，無論佢係租或者自己住啦。

638
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:56,860
係應唔應該因為噉樣而之後賣出，而政府應該收到個十個percent咧？咁嗱，我哋考慮呢個問題。

639
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:04,780
嗱，我啊覺得噉樣嗱，因為咧，如果你睇翻當啊，之前你依個廿四個月。

640
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:11,940
啊！嗰陣時即係而家嘅例咧，係好少部分，即係換句話講咧，嗰度係誒。

641
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:19,740
誒附件一啊，OK，就係講緊誒一千五百四廿九。

642
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:24,250
咁所以咧，如果純粹從一個大嘅供應嘅角度咧，

643
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:26,830
我當誒。

644
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:32,570
持有廿四個月，本來啲一五四九咧就誒係誒。

645
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:53,430
啊，sorry，我應該咁講，誒應該咧就係我要睇翻有幾多誒嘅買咗，然後廿hold住廿四個月，有可能之後咧係有可能個比例係放出，但係咧因為你有十個percent咧就少咗啦噉。嗱，噉你如果睇翻誒嗰個附件一嗰度咧，你。

646
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:55,540
用用翻而家個個情況啦。

647
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:57,990
佢如果用個税率係五個percent咧？

648
01:54:58,290 --> 01:55:09,900
去到廿四十二至廿四個月咧，會放嘅咧，嗰十誒會抽咗嘅咧，就係一五四九，即係呢啲真係買買啊嘛。咁如果一五四九咧，佔嗰個十幾萬咧，個數目好細嘅。

649
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:16,020
咁即係換句話講咧，而家進一步，你如果真係加到三十六個月，十個percent。

650
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:29,850
噉我只能夠講咧，就我當你再再細啲啦嚇個比例。咁即係換句話講咧，實際上你壓縮嗰個供應，即係換句話講，會喺廿四個月前買買入嗰啲，而又唔放樓嘅人咧。

651
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:34,240
其實個而供應市場嘅咧，你靠呢個供應咧，呢個供應係好細。

652
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:38,660
咁因此咧，嗰個影響咧，如果喺呢個角度咧，係好細嘅。呢個第一。

653
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,260
第二咧就係。

654
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:57,450
應唔應該啦？即係話嗰啲人應唔應該廿四個月都算係一個合理嘅誒叫做誒誒持有嘅限期咧？噉樣嗱，你問我咧，我覺得呢個見仁見智嘅，我冇我冇覺得絕對價值嘅。不過如果係噉嘅話咧，我唯一驚咧就係你個趨勢咧就點咧？

655
01:55:57,730 --> 01:56:01,020
因為最慘，我一路問你嘅時候，胡建一，你答個問題咧。

656
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:03,240
你覺得呢個咧成效不彰啊？

657
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:07,220
嗱，阿柏志高先生咧講過幾次啊！

658
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,440
就係咩啊？越嚟越淡啦，嗰個效果。

659
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:30,790
你問我咧，我暫時蘇智，我睇唔到呢個噉樣嘅。我希望你再諗下點樣去表達得好啲，越立越淡呢個。但係如果咧定你一定一路咁講，越嚟越淡，三十六啦，咁跟住之後咧，你下一年又哎呀越嚟越淡啦，噉啊三十六之後即係可能再多一年咧，你又你又會又加。

660
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:41,410
六個月嗰啲咧就唔係二十咯，變咗三十咯，六至十二個月啦變咗二十五咯噉，因為你對我嚟講，你嗰個已經一路diminishing，你一路一定係diminishing effect㗎嘛。

661
01:56:41,690 --> 01:56:46,870
咁如你話淡，我又要再加啲藥喎。咁咁呢個咪無止境咁加。

662
01:56:47,190 --> 01:57:07,200
所以我真係唔明你你加到嘅係咪加到點啊？幾多年後啊？阿梁振英話有嗰啲新樓誒誒，會會好大幅增加係嘛？係咪加到五年後咁嗰陣時，可能呢個税率加到五十啊、四十啊、三十啊咁咯，係嘛？即係我變咗，我聽你咁講咧，呢個噉樣嘅説服嘅原因咧，就變咗係係難以接受咯。我話討厭你。

663
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:27,210
In a short response, okay, because we have to end the meeting. Sure. Okay. Two points. First, I don't think that the SSD has had much effect on the supply. We, we, I've explained already a couple of times why. What we've, what we've achieved through SSD is to prevent people who have the idea of short-term speculation.

664
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:35,840
Getting into the market in the first place, that doesn't affect supply. So I think we can leave that one to one side. The second point is that

665
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,790
In terms of

666
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:50,810
The rates, we we when we introduced this, we thought that fifteen, ten and five per cent were the appropriate rates. But it is clear, and I would refer you to paragraph three.

667
01:57:51,250 --> 01:58:11,260
The 5% rate really does not have the effect that we anticipated at that time. So hence, we think that 10%, based on our experience with SSD over two years, is the minimum rate to have the effect that we want. And I can just very quickly point you to the middle of paragraph three, where it says the number of cases has been on the rise. 83 in March to a

668
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:31,270
12218 in September 2012. It's that rate of increase in the number of short-term speculation-type cases that worries us, and that's what we're trying to deal with. So I'll end there. Okay. 好，今日嘅會議我諗去到呢度啦。咁秘書會幫我哋誒一陣間收集翻頭先。

669
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:51,280
先大家對行政機關嘅要求，咁希望佢下一次提供進一步資料。我諗，嗯，下一次行政機關都請你盡早將文件提出，我哋都會希望畀司處盡力配合啦。噉我哋提翻委員下一次會議嘅時間係二月十八號上午九點，係同團體會面。咁咧就。

670
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:58,780
就之後嘅開會時間已經傳越咗畀大家，請大家喺日記上預留開會時間啦。咁宣佈今日嘅會議去到呢度，唔該曬。
