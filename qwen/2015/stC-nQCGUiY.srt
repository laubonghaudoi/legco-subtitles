1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:08,490
我哋二零一二年印花税修訂條例草案委員會誒已經夠法定人數，咁而家宣佈會議正式開始。

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:29,300
咁以前嘅第一項，張宇仁議員咧喺二零一三年一月廿一號致函法案委員會，表示希望加入本委員會。咁有關函件咧已經發送畀大家啦。咁睇下大家對於張議員加入嘅要求有冇其他意見？

3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,540
好，如果冇我哋就歡迎阿張議員加入。

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:52,990
咁第二咧就係有關個人金錢利益嘅披露，議事規則第八十三條規定，喺立法會或任何委員會或小組委員會會議上，議員不得就其有直接或間接金錢利益事宜動議任何議案或修正案，或就該事宜發言，除非該議員披露有。

5
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:10,940
關利益性質，因此我提醒委員，假如委員就二零一二年印花税修訂條例草案嘅討論項目有直接或間接金錢利益嘅話咧，請委員按照議事規則第八十三條嘅規定，考慮係咪需要披露有關利益嘅性質。

6
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,020
係啊，田議員。

7
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:33,380
阿阿田北俊議員，唔緊要你先啦。誒，主席，我有從事香港地產嘅活動，但我想再問清楚，係咪每次開會我都要講多句噉啊？定係可以今次啊，就申報曬所有繼續喺呢條條例草案嘅誒所為申報咧？好啊！阿湯家華議員，主席，可唔可以問一問法律顧問，其實？

8
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:53,390
誒雖然主持頭先你講嘅嘢係啱嘅，但係如果議員嗰個利益同香全香港人嘅利益係相等嘅，即係大家都有機會買樓，大家都有機會賣樓嘅咧，就唔需要申報嘅，或者法律顧問誒澄清下個我個我個理解啱唔啱？如果唔係，係咪我哋每個每次開開口講都要申報咧？我覺得。

9
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:08,150
每個人都有機會買樓啊，有機會賣樓嘅。係阿梁議員，係誒，我係誒有直接或者間接嘅利益，因為我係從事税務工作，亦都係印花税我其中一個主族嚟嘅。

10
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,160
阿陳健林議員。

11
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,660
就係我亦都可能會誒涉及利益，因為我有物業，亦都不排除喺呢段時間裏邊有做買賣。

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,230
好嗱，咁咧，我先就住啊，係阿謝偉全議員，係。

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:38,290
誒，我都想講，因為我從事房地產業務嘅，噉我亦都有即係有機會買樓嚇，咁亦都有機會有用公司買樓、個人買樓嚇，所以申報。

14
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,160
係阿湯家華議員頭先個問題，我請法律顧問先回應先啦，好嘛？

15
00:02:43,440 --> 00:03:03,450
多謝主席。多謝主席。根據議事規則咧，我哋就睇唔到咧。即係假如議員嗰個利益，如果係有直接或者間接嘅金錢利益，如果同廣大市民咧一個類似或者相同嗰個利益咧，係咪需要闊即係可以闊免嗰個申報？即係就冇一個明文噉樣寫嘅。咁當然我亦都明白咧，主席喺。

16
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:13,240
會前有提過，即係話點樣處理利益申報係咪每一次發言之前或喺投票之前咧都要申報一次咧？咁呢個我諗委員會可以誒。

17
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:33,630
諗一個方法去處理，因為以前亦都有噉嘅先例嘅，例如雷曼嗰個誒委員會咧，當時個做法咧係先做一轉咧，所謂書面嘅申報，咁咧每一位委員咧，佢哋有覺得有需要嘅咧，就做咗個申報，咁個申報佢哋都記錄在案啦。咁到之後發言嘅時候。

18
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:53,640
就咧，誒以我理解咧，佢哋就冇每一輪咧，到再個別嘅發言咧，係申報一次嘅。咁呢個係一個做法。咁如果話需唔需要話書面申報咗之後，每一次發言或者投票之前，再去申報一次咧，呢個或者委員會誒嘅意見咧，我諗可以做一個決定嘅。咁但係書面是。

19
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,610
先做一個，即係做一轉，全部誒委員嘅申報咧，呢個係以前有做過嘅。

20
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:20,240
好誒，多謝法律顧問嘅澄清。我事先咧開會前都同秘書處商量，因為誒秘書處都特別提醒我咧，需要提醒議員關於呢一個議事規則嘅要求。咁綜合咗其他委員會嘅做法，我建議咧，我哋不如參考誒專責委員會嘅做法，就係誒讓議員有一個一次性。

21
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:33,680
定嘅申報噉就誒記錄喺秘書處，噉啊作為誒一個資料，咁避免咗日後每一次開會前都要發言，睇下大家覺得呢個做法，大家認唔認同？

22
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:47,820
啊，湯家驊議員，主席，頭先誒，其他同事申報嘅時候都提醒咗我，即係我當然將來都可能有機會係會處理到印花税嘅官司或者法律意見嘅噉，或者我都應該就此係係申報。

23
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:55,580
係，阿張宇仁議員。唔爭著我啦，我都可能會買樓。係林建峯議員。

24
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,230
啊，處處處處長，啊，我都啊，即係啊。

25
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:21,830
擔任董事嘅公司都擁有一啲啊樓房啦。咁個人嚟講，我亦都唔排除啊，即係我啊，我我都有，我都有。sorry，我都擁有一啲誒單位誒，將來可能會誒有儲到錢，又會繼續買嘅。咁所以我都我都。

26
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:41,840
其實誒誒，不如咁啦，因為擁有物業同埋誒，可能將來會買賣，任何人都有可能會發生。啊，當然未擁有物業物業就係另一個問題，但係將來會買賣物業，我相信呢個係所有成員都會可能誒會會出現嘅嘅一個可能利益啦。咁呢個我哋記錄在案啦，好嘛？我諗呢個唔係好合適要噉樣申。

27
00:05:41,840 --> 00:06:00,310
步伐啊，黃定光議員。誒，我都同其他嘅委員一樣啊，我本身係擁有物業，同埋公司名下亦都可能有亦有物業。誒，可見嘅未來咧，就會唔會存在買賣咧？而家仲係一個未知數，但係絕對有冇可能？

28
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,910
好啊！阿姚思榮議員。

29
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:23,440
誒，我申報我哋集團誒都有做房地產嘅，但我唔知道佢而家有或者將來會唔會做，噉我申報咗先。好啊，噉我本人都要申報啦，我係誒會計師啦，噉我受聘嘅公司咧本身都有從事税務核數嘅業務，相信都會就住呢一個特別引發。

30
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:41,070
加税向客人提供意見嘅，噉我亦都理解咧，佢會有誒意見就住呢個條例草案會入嚟申述嘅。咁呢個第一，但係我不我並不是從事相關嘅誒意見嘅提供嘅。第二咧就係誒我同埋我屋企人亦都係業主啦，將來誒亦都有機會買買物業啦。

31
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:55,740
啊，噉啊，係啊，潘小平議員。啊，我我都申到，因為呢個呢個利益咧可能好闊好窄。噉我自己有物業嘅，咁當然同其他同事一樣，將來唔知咩環境，但係起碼咧都講咗先啦。

32
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:15,810
係咁亦咁啦，誒我哋都誒按翻頭先法律顧問嗰個提議，我哋參考翻雷曼專責小組嗰個做法，讓就算今日未到嘅委員都有一個書面申報嘅誒安排。噉係啦，係啦，噉就避免咗日後每一次發言前委員都需要申報翻相關嘅利益。

33
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:29,450
好，如果大家對呢個做法冇意見，我哋就有冇再今次嘅申報需要喺呢個時候講咧？如果冇，我哋之後都會啊提一提大家，好嘛？即係幾時之前請大家做一個書面申報。

34
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,330
好，噉我哋呢度就呢個議程就誒。

35
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:54,900
去到呢度啦，噉啊，秘書處都提醒大家可以睇翻咧，參考翻議員個人利益監察委員會發出嘅文件，題目為《議員披露金錢利益及有直接金錢利益嘅情況下表決或退席嘅相關規定》。噉啊，大家如果有需要就參考啦。噉，議程第二項自上次會議後發出嘅文件，噉我哋收到香港基。

36
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:06,040
基督教協會提交嘅意見書，立法會C.B.括弧一四五二足一二開分一三零一號文件，該份意見書咧已經送交政府當局誒作出回應啦。

37
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,860
係啊，王國建議。

38
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:29,150
誒，我聽到正話有同事提醒我係咪要申報？係啊，冇錯，冇錯。啊，噉我都有有有個物業嘅，係好，有嚇工會，工會我好多工會嘅喎，我好多物業嘅喎，大佬。唔係頭，阿阿黃議員，我哋就話我哋會透過秘書處提醒所有委員，等佢讓佢書面都再申報。

39
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:46,720
做一次，大家認為可能嘅誒誒利益噉啊，停息係係啦。不過，今次如果大家希望先新報都係會記錄在案嘅，係請政府官員進場係咪？姚思榮議員，你有你有補充私人問題啫，都係私人嘅排排隊係嘛係啦。O K。

40
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,310
啊，胡志偉議員，係好，你申報啦。啊，都係有物業，O.K.好。

41
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,750
嗯。

42
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,980
誒政府當局咧會有個簡介嘅，咁簡介之後就讓委員提問啦。

43
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,270
係。

44
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:38,500
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you. I may now start. Thank you. I I understand some members may have had briefings on various different occasions, but I thought it would be useful just to set the scene so everybody understands where we're coming from and give members some background. So I will take a few minutes just to go through this presentation, but

45
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,250
I think it would be useful so that we all know what what the background and the logic is.

46
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,470
First, I think the most important thing is that.

47
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,430
The reason.

48
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:57,230
I think everybody understands that the property market has been really very exuberant, to say the least, in the last few months.

49
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:08,390
The causes are tight supply of units, flats, extremely low interest rates, and of course, to a certain extent, the influx of capital from overseas.

50
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:22,940
The net effect of all these different impacts is that the property market is really out of step with the real economy, and it's for that reason that the government feels that it's necessary to take steps.

51
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,720
to address some of these issues.

52
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,890
Accordingly, the financial secretary announced new demand-side measures.

53
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,270
嗯。

54
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:48,280
And let me stress, this is first an enhancement to an existing special stamp duty that was introduced in 2010, and the introduction of the new buyer's stamp duty. And this was announced on the 26th of October of last year.

55
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
the bill.

56
00:10:50,900 --> 00:11:00,450
fairly straightforward actually proposes to increase the special stamp duty rates and extend the coverage from 24 months to 36 months.

57
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,420
I think it's important to bear in mind that the existing stamp duty.

58
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:13,310
是設 at 15% on top of the standard stamp duty rates for the first six months.

59
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,390
10% for the next six months， and then 5% for the following year.

60
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,130
The changes that we're proposing will increase the first period.

61
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,630
六個月，up to twenty percent。

62
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,910
of the amount or value of the consideration.

63
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:42,380
如果the property is held for that six-month period or less, it then goes from 10 to 15% for the period between six months to one year.

64
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:56,190
And then for the next year, it would be increased up to 10% from 5%, and then we add a further year, so that the total effect is for 36 months or less.

65
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,020
第二，和我諗。

66
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,160
The new element to this proposal is the introduction of the buyer stamp duty.

67
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:28,450
on all residential properties acquired by any person, and we would point out that this would include companies, except a Hong Kong permanent resident, and the buyer stamp duty would be charged at a flat rate of 50% on all residential properties. Now, again, I must point out the difference between stamp special stamp duty and

68
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,480
免郵費，免郵費。

69
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,670
是 payable on the subsequent sale after the first purchase, whereas buy stamp duty is payable.

70
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,500
on the purchase.

71
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,010
在 drafting the bill， we've taken into account views that we've received.

72
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,660
from the community，including those received from the Legco panel on housing。

73
00:12:51,940 --> 00:13:05,980
The panel on financial affairs at the joint meeting on the 2nd of November of last year, and during various meetings we've had with different stakeholders, both in the industry and technical groups.

74
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,810
Now, taking you very quickly through the key pieces, the key elements of the bill.

75
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,500
定義香港永久居民，那些會被 exempted。

76
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:29,730
是 quite straightforward. It's holders of valid permanent identity cards under the registration of persons ordinance, and that's Cap 177. And obviously, also applies to those people who are entitled to such a card.

77
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:45,500
There will be exemptions which already exist under the existing special stamp duty would be extended to cover the the new set special stamp duty rates and the buy stamp duty.

78
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,070
taking us quickly through this, minor and mentally incapacitated persons will be exempted from the buyer stamp duty.

79
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:04,430
The Hong Kong permanent resident must be the purchaser or transferee, acting on his or her own behalf, in the acquisition of the residential property.

80
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:24,530
except for someone who is a minor or a mentally incapacitated person who, due to the lack of capacity to enter into a legally binding agreement, must in practice require another person to act on his or her own behalf. That provision is, I think, fairly straightforward.

81
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:32,860
another area of exemption, we made reference to the existing exemptions again, and we suggest that those just keep.

82
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,110
pass through into the biostamp duty. These would include.

83
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,940
acquisition of a residential property.

84
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:48,430
由一香港永久居民，Jointly with a non-Hong Kong permanent resident who is a very close relative， and again that's already provided for in the bill.

85
00:14:48,790 --> 00:15:02,740
assignment of a residential property to a non-Hong Kong permanent resident who is a very close relative, the acquisition or transfer of a residential property by court order, for example, in the context of divorce or so on.

86
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,390
residential properties as a gift to charitable institutions that are exempted from tax under the Inland Revenue Ordinance.

87
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:19,950
買賣或轉讓一間居屋，有關的收據文件只涉及已故人士的遺產。

88
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:30,710
Now， the one area where I think there has been considerable discussion is in respect of the application to companies.

89
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,870
The policy intention is to accord priority.

90
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,510
to home ownership needs of Hong Kong permanent residents. That's been stated very clearly from the start.

91
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,200
嗯。

92
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,610
It is.

93
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,270
I think important to recognise that in tackling this issue, we need to have a very clear target.

94
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,820
It doesn't do to put in place provisions that can be.

95
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,870
easily circumvented or abused.

96
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,050
There are views.

97
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:16,610
That various different type of company should be exempted, and we have looked at those suggestions, and indeed we are still looking at submissions that we've received from different organisations.

98
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,100
但。

99
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,930
There are some fundamental issues.

100
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,730
we need to be able to identify.

101
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,380
一個系統，那係，asily controlled and properly able to be regulated.

102
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:39,340
和，的建議，那，它會是個直截了當的問題，來識別一家公司，，以香港永久居民股東的資格為基礎。

103
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,090
for the purpose of exempting from by stamp duty.

104
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,740
會 deviate from the basic legal principle that a company.

105
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,270
being an entity.

106
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,210
In its own right, should be independent from its shareholders, and I think this is an important point.

107
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,680
It's also not practical to exempt companies whose shareholders are all Hong Kong permanent residents.

108
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,350
simply by putting in place a self-declaratory mechanism.

109
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,120
again.

110
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:18,460
the the issue here is how do you ensure that the the declaration is valid and is constant throughout the period

111
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,570
now.

112
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,590
The challenges would be how do you ensure

113
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,160
That any company, be it small or large, can have multiple shareholders.

114
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,070
some of which could be body corporate, in other words, not individual persons.

115
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,700
可以辨識每一個那個人。

116
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:58,410
它也考索到問題：，有幾多層在公司架構內應覆蓋，以確保最終受益人可被識別。所以，有幾多個實務問題我們已研究過，但到目前尚未能克服。

117
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,750
Besides, there is still the issue.

118
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,660
Beyond this, of companies incorporated overseas and simply not required to provide information on their shareholders.

119
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,530
thus rendering this option impossible to verify and follow up.

120
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:32,980
Furthermore, shareholders with Hong Kong permanent resident status can actually very easily circumvent the provisions through transferring property entitlements to non-Hong Kong permanent residents, and there are various ways that this can be done through nomination, simply allotment of new shares and so on.

121
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:47,880
thus apparently the shareholding would remain with the original shareholders, but in reality again control of the company would have been transferred, and that would be something that could not be seen to the relevant authorities.

122
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,600
所以， therefore。

123
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:57,820
We've taken a view that at this stage it is not possible for us to identify a way to deal with companies in a straightforward and practical manner.

124
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:09,340
however, having said that, we do understand that companies are involved in various transactions relating to property, and one of the areas that we're particularly concerned about is that we should not.

125
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,270
hinder redevelopment.

126
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:28,150
of older areas or or industrial or other areas into residential or non-residential properties. I think this is a very important principle. So we've tried to look at ways that this this could be addressed.

127
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,830
And what we're proposing under the bill is a refund mechanism.

128
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:44,380
such that acquisition of residential properties for the construction of immovable properties will be exempted from BSD, provided that the immovable property is constructed within a six-year period.

129
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:59,500
The six-year period starts when the relevant developer has become the owner of the entire lot of the redevelopment concern. Now, the issue here, of course, is it takes time to consolidate disparate ownership into one ownership.

130
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,400
therefore we think the trigger point should be when that

131
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,830
總體所有權已經獲取得。

132
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:15,490
The six-year period we believe is is reasonable, in that for most developments, by the time you've acquired the property, six years is more than ample to develop.

133
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,210
these these properties.

134
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,910
to make sure that we.

135
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,070
also take into account the the fact that there may be phased development.

136
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,580
We've considered.

137
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,450
That construction.

138
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,090
would have been completed if the owner has.

139
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:45,660
secured the occupation permit in respect of the redevelopment, or the first occupation permit, if the redevelopment is taking place in phases.

140
00:20:47,530 --> 00:21:03,280
如果the lot is subject to an order for sale made by the Lands Tribunal under the Lands Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment Ordinance， and the Lands Tribunal on application by the developer allows a further period， then again the further period would count as the starting point。

141
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,180
for the six years.

142
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,180
again， where least modification is required after the developer has acquired the lots。

143
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:20,920
counting of the six-year period commences from the completion of the first such lease modification, i.e. the date on which the lease modification document is issued.

144
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:30,120
finally, when a new lot is granted by the government, the counting of the six-year period commences with the grant of the new lot by the government. Obviously.

145
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:55,700
question obviously arises of why could there not be other ways to challenge or to determine when a property has been acquired? We've looked at various things, but frankly, we need first to ensure that the development, the redevelopment proceeds. That's the basic objective.

146
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:15,710
thus, the personal company pursuing redevelopment has to pay the BSD upfront because, again, as I said before, it takes time to secure all the properties in a mixed ownership situation. But then the reimbursement will kick in as soon as the redevelopment has taken place, and that obviously complies with our objective to.

147
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,910
要 ensure that the redevelopment proceeds.

148
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,770
嗯。

149
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:32,260
One other area is that where individual units are transferred from one body corporate to an associated body corporate, and that's defined under section 45 of the Stamp Duty Ordinance.

150
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:44,280
Before the redevelopment is completed, the associated body corporate may also apply for the refund upon completion of that development. Again, the six-year rule would still apply.

151
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,310
finally, in terms of.

152
00:22:49,840 --> 00:23:09,850
the volatility of the market and recognising that markets are changing quite rapidly and could change very quickly, we've proposed that further adjustment to special stamp duty and buyer stamp duty rates should be made by means of subsidiary legislation, subject to negative vetting by the legislative council, and this would give us

153
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:20,660
The flexibility to move quickly, as and when the market situation changes, and indeed in that context, that would allow the rates to be set to zero if that were appropriate.

154
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:30,470
finally, the bill proposes the measures should be should take effect on the twenty seventh of October, in other words, the day after the announcement.

155
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:40,750
and the inland revenue department will be recording all residential property transactions that take place between that date and the date on which the bill is enacted.

156
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,920
Divan notes will be issued after the enactment.

157
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:53,160
We, I have a full team here ready to answer your questions and try and respond as best we can to members' inquiries. Thank you very much.

158
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:14,440
好，而家有六位議員表示要發言，分別係姚思榮、田北俊、梁繼昌、石禮謙、黃國興同埋林建峯議員。咁誒，我哋建議五分鐘嘅時間。啊，提一提頭先可能遲一少少入嚟嘅議員，我哋第一個階段做咗一個申報嘅，咁之後亦都會畀大家進行一個書面申。

159
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,030
無勢力議員，你有補充係嘛？

160
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:33,750
係代表地產建造業嘅議員喺度。啊，我係有地產有依個物業喺香港嘅，同埋我係上市公司嘅誒非執董喺喺依個register，即係立法會register已經講曬㗎啦。

161
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:41,830
好，誒，我建議五分鐘時間先啦。姚思榮議員，你冇舉手。哦，你冇舉手，O.K.好。田北俊議員。

162
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,020
誒主席，好開心誒見到政府帶咗咁多同事嚟啦。第一個問題咧，我想問問。

163
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,650
個法律問題嚟嘅。

164
00:24:50,930 --> 00:25:10,940
嗯，香港好注重合作精神啦。噉你政府亦都有好多地產買賣嘅，譬如喺政府拍賣地畀啲地產商個拍賣標書寫得好清楚，將會起咩樓幾時起好嗰啲情況嘅個標書入邊從嚟冇提到，忽然間有一樣嘢叫B S D。

165
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,310
係。

166
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,740
有十五個percent會得令到啊，地產商發展之後啲物業賣出去咧。

167
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:30,690
嗰個客買客係少咗嘅。請問法律嗰邊啊，有冇畀過政府意見？呢條條例啊，係唔會引致政府被地產商喺政府拍賣咗地土之後啊，去司法覆核或者告政府咧？

168
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,320
好啊，邊位答咧？

169
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,570
嗯。

170
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,200
perhaps I'll have a go at this.

171
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:48,970
I think the the the situation is the same for any form of stamp duty, if you if the

172
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:57,470
If the law is enacted, that obviously supersedes anything done through the lease conditions, and that's a basic principle that applies.

173
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,980
does matter of a special stamp duty or buy stamp duty, so certainly as far as.

174
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:17,360
Our position is concerned. There should be no inconsistency between anything that government sells and have with particular lease conditions, and the enactment of new legislation to apply stamp duty provisions.

175
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,420
Anyone like to add to that?

176
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:41,040
好，阿秘書長係誒，根據頭先阿田議員所講咧，就係如果係政府嘅批地嘅合約，即係譬如包括透過政府賣地批出嘅合約，同埋一啲政府嘅租購，收咗補地價嗰類啦。嚇，而家喺按照印花税嘅條例第三十九C嘅規定咧，係無需徵。

177
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:53,320
收印花税嘅，咁所以印花税咧而家嘅定義就包括所謂重價印花税同埋額外印花税。咁有關嘅法例通過之後咧，印花税嘅定義都會涵蓋埋今日我哋想講嘅B S D。

178
00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:03,210
朱Sir，我當然明白啦。如果呢個禮拜聽日政府撤止嗰塊地，我哋緊係唔使畀呢個所謂印花税啦。但係當我賣出去嗰陣時啊，

179
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:17,630
我嘅客就少咗啦嘛，咁如果我客少咗，你呢個標書入邊冇話有呢樣，噉我會建議如果政府喺未來嘅時候拍賣投標啲地啊，要唔要提埋？我而家會收你呢個十五個percent嘅。

180
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,560
誒所謂誒B.S.D係嘛啊？誒呢個噉嘅做法咧？

181
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:42,410
係，李司長。係，我諗個法例咧就好清楚定咗政府賣地嘅嗰個合約㗎。咁至於頭先田議員所講就係話，誒一啲發展商佢作為一個公司，佢誒買咗呢一幅地上邊，佢再建立一啲嘅物業咧，嗰啲物業再去出售嘅時候咧，以而家印花。

182
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:56,340
税條例嘅定義咧，呢一啲物業而係公司賣出咧，誒就會係有涉及一啲誒到時印花税嘅有關嘅規定㗎啦。咁所以嗰個係講緊另一個層次嘅嘢。好，多謝。咁第二個問題，我想問，既然政府啊，

183
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:03,260
話而家呢個係短期措施，因為誒個供應嘅地唔夠，所以市面唔夠樓誒。

184
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:15,000
物價起水做嘅，咁點解呢個BSD唔係SSD啊？整一個廿四個月、三十六個月，除非政府有冇信心喺廿四個月、三十六個月啊？

185
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:26,090
提供咗咁多地嘅地產繼續嘅升，咁先至咁啦。如果既然政府話係短期措施，點解唔似個S S D啊？有個廿四個月啊，或者三十六個月限期咧？

186
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,230
係。

187
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,830
The two have different.

188
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:39,300
Special stamp duty was introduced to deal with a particular issue of speculation, short-term speculation, and we believe that in fact.

189
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:48,250
The short-term speculation has been effectively dealt with in the first two periods, because the rates at 15 and 10% were.

190
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,200
sufficient. however

191
00:28:50,480 --> 00:29:10,490
Over time, the effect of that on speculation, particularly in the the one year to to twelve months to one year and subsequent, the effect has diminished. So the reason that we're increasing the special stamp duty is to maintain that effect. The bias stamp. I agree to the essence. Ah, see, my Majesty, there's only four minutes.

192
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:21,920
Buyers' stamp duty is a different objective, and as I said at the beginning, the buyers' stamp duty is intended to give priority in the purchase of property to Hong Kong permanent residents. 啊，點解冇三年嘅限制咧？

193
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:42,790
Because in in that sense, the the again I pointed this out. The difference is you apply the buyer stamp duty on the first purchase, whereas the special stamp duty applies on the subsequent sale after the purchase. And there's a distinct there's a difference in approach in that in that regard.

194
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,430
好啊，好，誒另一下一位議員啊，梁繼昌議員。

195
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,900
多謝主席。多謝帕斯科特先生的演講。

196
00:29:53,180 --> 00:30:04,670
我有兩個問題，係有關免税制度對擬議的BSD。一個係較為一般性質的問題，另一個係較為具體的問題。

197
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:15,100
my first question is how would you treat partnership and trust if a partnership or trust

198
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:29,900
Is acquiring a property? How do you identify whether the partnership or the trust is resident in Hong Kong or not? That's the first question. Can either Mr Wong or Mr Pascoe answer the question first?

199
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,730
邊個答呢個問題咧？

200
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,630
好啊！阿黃生。

201
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,070
第一個，如果係一個誒。

202
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:57,730
合夥嘅身份去買一個物業咧，咁基本上喺香港法律上邊係佢用合夥人嘅名稱、個人名稱去買嘅。咁如果我哋得到法律，即係我哋就住個問題，我哋諮詢個法律意見。咁咧，法律意見話，如果一個合夥人嘅股東佢係買。

203
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,220
聯名去買一個住宅物業，係拎嚟係畀一個。

204
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:09,940
呢個合夥嘅用途咧，噉樣咧，依個咧雖然佢係香港嘅誒。

205
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,340
永久性居民全部都係，但係佢係代表緊呢個。

206
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,320
誒，合夥嘅。

207
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,780
去買呢個物業嘅，咁呢個情況之下都係要納入呢個。

208
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,550
徵要徵買家印花税嘅範疇。

209
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:44,870
budget fund誒咁個trust咧，我黃生，我我我未講完，我想問一問啦。你你嗰你個partnership入邊有五個partner啦，係咪咁？你係咪要全部五個partner都係香港嘅永久居民，你先正畀嗰個exemption佢？佢佢個partnership係香港，即係香港，但係佢中間有有三個人，比如係冇香港。

210
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,680
身份證又有兩個有，噉你點樣處理呢啲事件嚇？

211
00:31:48,960 --> 00:32:08,970
係，噉係另外一個層次嚟啦。呢個就係話，如果係一個合夥嘅生意啦，空上講啊，咁有五個合夥人，有兩個係香港永久性居民，三個唔係香港永久居民。佢哋今次嘅購買住宅物業呢個行為咧，都係代表緊呢個合夥嘅業務嘅。噉樣咧，無論佢當中係唔係。

212
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,600
全部係香港嘅優秀居民咧，佢都係需要交呢個係買家印花税。

213
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:34,960
哦，即係成個即係你哋嗰個誒闊面咧，係唔包個partnership嘅，完全係冇錯。哦，OK，咁噉，如果係以個trust形式買嘅時候，你又點樣定定佢係咪香港居民，即係非香港居民咧？信託形式，信託形式邊位答咧？都係阿王局長係嘛？好啊，咁其實正話喺誒。

214
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:56,030
上秘書長裏邊個簡介都講咗啦，咁即係喺我哋而家個呈交畀立法會嘅法例草案上邊咧，講明咧係一個人佢係豁免咧，就由香港永久性居民去用自己嘅身份，唔係代表其他人嘅身份去購買先得嘅。咁除咗有兩個exception，就係話咧係。

215
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:05,010
嗰個係一個未成年人，或者係精神上冇行為能力嘅人，佢就可以揾其他人，例如一個受託人。

216
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:11,930
出面幫佢買咗一個物業，咁但係佢都係要聲稱佢係代一個。

217
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:22,980
誒未成年人或者係精神上無行為能力嘅人，而依個少年誒未成年人或者係精神上無行為能力嘅人咧，都佢本身都係要香港永久性居民嚟嘅。

218
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,540
咁先有闕文嘅。

219
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:45,030
咁但係，如果你你好多時咧，一個受託一個trust去買物業，佢都唔會話畀你聽。究竟佢係咪代表自己，又代表個信託？你係咪需要佢做一個聲明啊？或者點樣樣去去監控呢樣嘢咧？究竟啊？喺我哋嘅安排裏邊咧，我哋係會要求佢哋提提交一張表格畀我哋，要做咗一個噉嘅聲明嘅。好。

220
00:33:45,090 --> 00:34:03,150
誒，仲有一個比較啊，specific嘅問題就係有封信咧，就係香港啊基督教協進會寫入嚟嘅，就誒一月十七號，噉就關於section八十八嗰啲慈善傳遞，噉你哋其實會唔會係誒畀埋闊面咧？如果慈善傳遞去買一啲物業嘅時候？

221
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:23,440
係邊位答咧？係咪啊，黃高長喺喺我哋現行建議裏邊咧，係一個愧贈畀個慈善團體先有豁免噉，因為收應因應收到呢個誒基督教協進會一封信啦，我哋仲係研究緊呢個問題嘅係啦。今朝我哋開場嘅時候已經講轉交畀政府，等佢一評回答啲意見嘅，因為除咗呢個基督教協進會，再其他嘅意見都會。

222
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,830
入嚟嘅，好嘅，唔該曬。好啊，噉就第三位議員咧，就係啊。

223
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,100
石禮謙如。

224
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:49,650
誒主席，主席誒，即係誒，我我我個人係支持依個SSD嘅，但係一個最大嘅問題咧就BSD啊，依度正我跟住問，但係我未問BSD之前咧，主席就係想問下過往嗰二十個月依個BSSD啊，帶嚟香港嗰個。

225
00:34:49,650 --> 00:35:09,660
影響係幾大咧？收政府收咗幾多錢喺呢個S.S.D税嗰度咧？第一，第二，呢個S.S.D喺過去嗰十誒廿四個月、六個月、十二個月、十八個月、廿四個月，每我希望佢畀啲資料我哋咧，有幾多宗呢啲個案，噉啊睇到佢嚴重唔嚴重？我個人。

226
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:20,610
睇到個SSD咧，嗰陣時誒又係Mr.Prescott坐喺度又解釋咧，又係誒一個辣椒嚟啊！我哋喺嗰陣時當時係一個誒。

227
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:40,900
啊！喺喺個議會嗰度已經話咗，係唔掂喎。你只係依個S S D咧帶嚟香港一個情況喺度咧，只可買不可賣。你令到嗰個市場咧，仲更加仲更加少咗供應，噉啊會增高咗個價錢。唔會唔會，好有用㗎啦。

228
00:35:40,900 --> 00:36:00,910
啦咁用用佢有用個情況喺去到邊喺度？而家今時今日同埋兩年前個價係一樣咁上升嚇，咁依個係S S C有冇用咧？噉你就如果政府話有用，咁咪叫佢證明咧。主席第一，第二樣嘢，我想，因為我唔使去用書面答我得嘅，主席。噉啊，另外咧就公司。

229
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:10,960
知嗰度咯，頭先咧佢都講得好清楚咧，依個而家佢攞依個SSD好BSD好咧，係保護香港永久居民可以買到樓啊，主席。

230
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:31,250
噉你香港居然買到樓咧？我哋香港喺呢個基本法下賦予我哋咧喺第六條同埋一零五條咧，有一個擁可以有物業擁有權買賣嘅係我哋自由嘅選擇。咁呢樣嘢好重要，主席唔係淨係係講買樓好、賣樓好、炒樓好，呢個真係一個。

231
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:51,260
自由選擇喺一個自由社會，一個經喺一個咁開放型嘅社會度咧，忽然間政府咧就話：你只可以用你個人嘅名，你唔可以選擇用公司嘅名，因為佢驚住有外來嘅人或者喺誒誒有有呢個誒嚇第二啲人用公司係咪咁咧，就保護唔到香港。

232
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:11,270
講永久公民啦，咁咁喺依條條例嗰度咧，我哋都問過佢㗎啦。咁如果係用香港人用香港公司買，你係好窄嗰度，係好窄嗰個範圍裏邊要去宣誓，要去做任何你要做嘅嘢，嚇噉佢可以控制到咧，又喺三。

233
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:29,610
五年內唔準買嘅，咁點解唔可以咁做？點解係要好似又要去咁誒誒？好似而家去咁做喎？就依樣嘢就去要去答下主席。頭先佢嗰啲答唔到，佢佢只係講啲好多問題出嚟，但係好多問題出嚟太複雜啦，所以唔做啦。噉啊，要一一一刀切咁落去。

234
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:41,860
呢個政府唔係咁㗎嘛，主席。佢政府係有提提出個問題嚟，先要揾解決嘅辦法去做啊嘛。咁依又依個有有另外一個問題，係書面答得個主席，因為我問太多問題。

235
00:37:42,250 --> 00:38:02,260
唔想嘥大家朋友嘅時間，咁咧另外一樣嘢，主席就係關於市區重建啦。哇，講到非常之美麗，主席，但係咧呢個市區重建嗰度又可以畀翻錢你諗一諗啊，主席。如果啊，你用間你梗係用公司去買買樓宇嗰啲，如果私人唔係唔係唔係U R A U R A，佢成條市區重建咧就保。

236
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:22,270
換U R A嘅啫，唔係去為咗成個社會去去做嘅。U R A只係去去去畫咗個表，畫咗個藍圖出嚟咧。噉啊，去城市規劃委員會啊，噉啊啊proof實，噉啊可以去買咯。但係私人發發展商或者係唔係咁去做？佢睇到呢啲舊樓，佢買係一間買一間，有啲買。

237
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:42,280
成十年十五年，好似合夥咁喺灣仔買咗廿幾三廿年，都係咁買啦。噉你唔係可以咁去做，同埋咧，你當你去買樓嗰陣時咧，你用公司去買，冇人知道；用私人去買A、B、C，噉啊，梗係知道你喺度收緊啦。越收咧越高，越收越高，噉啊又扯高啲價錢。咁呢啲又係好好大噉。

238
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:58,080
問題，佢話佢話你十你六六個六年後咪畀翻錢你咯噉。六年後主席啊，如果係用公司去買啊，買咗買咗十年啊，再加埋嗰六年啊，十六年啊，十五個percent compound上去啊！

239
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:18,690
邊個做啊？咁依度咧對個市場咧供應嗰啲樓宇喺個舊區咧，有好大影響啦。噉係維護咧，又係維護一樣嘢啫。維護U R A就畀政府去掠掠掠。咁即係依樣嘢咧，佢係唔能咧，唔係冇諗過，即係諗得太絕啦，主席。每一樣嘢，所以頭先我我啲問題咁去問咧，就係由去。

240
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:35,930
攞咗幾多錢？個個意義喺邊度？有冇成效？一路咁去睇住佢公公司BSC點做嚇？跟住佢個市區重建係嗰啲嗰啲係點去做？表面上嘅懶好人就好人，又唔係做壞事。佢一係假嘅好人主席。

241
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:46,350
好啊，阿石議員問咗幾條問題，因為我諗都係好多議員都關注，我畀局方都作一個回應啦。誒，第一條我理解就係關於誒誒。

242
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:55,680
Special stamp duty嘅成效，第二條就係個宣誓，即係之前提嘅個exception點解唔得，第三就係對於市區重建嗰個影響。咁睇下邊位可以回應，好嘛？

243
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:16,520
Let me let me try and address some of these, and I'll ask my colleagues to supplement. I'm also conscious of the time. First, the introduction of special stamp duty and now by stamp duty has never been a revenue raising issue. We made that very clear at the start. As far as as we're concerned, if no

244
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,920
若一，個，人，要，賣，佢，嘅，屋，產，

245
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:42,250
There would be no stamp duty pebble. That would be fine. It would have achieved the objective of stopping the short-term speculation. We will give you those figures in terms of the actual income. And but I will say that the the number of transactions, which is far more important than the value of of

246
00:40:42,250 --> 00:41:02,260
Special stamp duty paid has fallen dramatically in terms of particularly the first six months to, and then the second six months. It's because the the transactions were increasing in the the twelve months to two years that we've had to look at extending the period. But we will give those figures separately.

247
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,800
你會補充文件畀我哋，定係一陣間有同事答嗰個數量？

248
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:28,090
好啊，好啊。Yeah, we'll do that. Let me finish first. Okay, okay. The second point I want to make here，啊，主席可唔可以對唔住，可唔可以叫答下點可以解點去解釋到啲？自從個S S D嚟咧，由兩年前開始個價錢一路咁節高上去，睇供應同埋個價錢咧，依個係好有個，唔係講錢嘅，主席。

249
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:35,290
頭先阿柏先生就解釋咗，就係個交投量下降啦。噉啊，石議員提嘅就係個對於價錢。

250
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:55,580
上升嘅影響。Exactly, Madam Chairman, as far again in terms of the total number of transactions, the number of short-term reselling did go down, and in that respect, there was an effect. But as I said, it's the total number that was involved in that that was the issue, and those figures.

251
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:15,590
Will will speak for themselves. As far as our assessment is concerned, the target to short to deal with short-term reselling on a speculative basis was achieved and is is still being successfully achieved. But it's that slightly longer period of one year to two years, etc. No, you don't understand my. 啊，食議員啊，不如第二輪啦，好。

252
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:35,600
我知啊，即係去去答啲問題唔啱，咁咪唔好答住。我所以要去用書面。我最只係話畀佢聽，主席，即係話佢佢用佢短期去減低個炒樓啊，但係長，但係短期、中期、長期令到好多人買樓咧高咗個價錢啊，佢就冇去解釋呢一樣嘢，主席。不，阿麥林長。

253
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:55,610
Again, I have explained in my introduction that the reason the prices have gone up is because of shortage of supply generally in the market, the influx of overseas capital, which has definitely been an issue, and that's one of the issues we're trying to deal with under the buy stamp duty. It's not related to the effects of special stamp duty, but I.

254
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,300
我解釋咗那啲，都係之前。

255
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:17,620
There are a couple of other points that I do want to touch on, particularly this issue of the comment that the honourable member has made that we're telling people they cannot buy by introducing buyer's stamp duty. Of course not, we have absolutely no intention of telling people they cannot buy.

256
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:37,630
What we're saying to people is, if you buy and you're not a Hong Kong permanent resident, you have to pay an additional tax in the form of a buyer's stamp duty. That's a very different message to saying you cannot buy. So that I think is a fundamental. Again, you're learning from our chief executive how to speak about meaning. 啊，石議員啊，我諗而家唔係對話嘅時間。

257
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:56,440
好誒，你仲有冇補充啊，秘書長？The final point on urban renewal. In fact, we have had some discussions on this with both reader and the honourable member was present. We recognise that it does take time to consolidate property.

258
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:14,110
the the challenge for us is how at what point does that property become developed for under the context of redevelopment because people do acquire property for many different reasons not only for redevelopment and it's the definition of redevelopment that's the issue and we feel that after

259
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:30,280
the the consolidation of numerous properties into one and the redevelopment process starting that's the starting point at which we can count the six years so that's that's the logic of that perhaps I can pass on to my colleague to to supplement on the other information.

260
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:50,800
好，阿李司長，誒主要兩方面咧，就住嗰個嘅成效嗰度咧，我畀少少嘅資料，可以如果誒再詳細，我哋可以會後再補充喺誒S S D喺二零一零年嘅十一月誒宣佈咗之後咧，其實總體嗰個住宅物業住宅嘅成交量咧係由二零一零。

261
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,990
年嘅全年十五萬多宗咧，係降到去二零一一年嘅九萬六。

262
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:18,570
宗直至到十二月誒二零一二為止咧，目前嗰個總體嘅住宅嘅成交量咧係九萬一千多宗，咁而可以睇到咧喺S S D頭先好似啊常秘書長所講咧，嗰個嘅誒交誒額外印花税嘅宗數咧，自喺十一月咧才。

263
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:38,580
政司司長宣佈之後咧，係由二零一二年嘅十一月咧二百五十四宗降到去二零一二年十二月嘅一百五十宗㗎。而當中咧誒，其實喺嗰個六個月轉售嘅數目咧，只係得六宗噉，所以咧呢個咧，我哋係睇到個S S D咧喺壓制嗰個嘅短期。

264
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:58,590
誒轉售物業嗰方面嘅成效。第二點咧，我就主要淨係想補充一句嘅啫，就喺B S D嗰度咧，我哋係建議咧係唔可以擴，即係要誒唔可以豁免誒公司咧。其實呢一個咧係符合翻我哋喺個政策上邊要照顧香港永久性居民作為佢自己個人嘅一個嘅住屋嘅需求。

265
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:18,660
誒，如果喺公司嗰方面有一啲香港嘅永久性居民，佢係作為股東咧，因為喺個法理上咧，公司咧佢個權利就係個公司，而係唔會再去追索翻個公司上邊嘅股東咧佢嘅身份嘅。咁所以喺個法誒律上邊咧，我哋必須咧要清楚咧係界定公司本身咧作。

266
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:27,600
作為一個實體咧，呢一方面係唔可以豁免咧，於嗰個誒交嗰個嘅誒買家印花税嘅。好啊，另下一位議員咧就係黃國興議員。

267
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,220
主席，我有兩個問題想問一問當局。

268
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,390
嗰個買家印花税咧，就係。

269
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,760
保障誒香港市民呢個嘅。

270
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,190
自由嘅權利啦，唔好畀啊！

271
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,320
外地或者係內地嘅買家咧，就係炒高啲樓價。

272
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,660
咁個精神咧，我係係支持嘅。

273
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:58,180
但係我亦都想指出一個問題咧，當局有冇諗到咧？因為而家人民幣。

274
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,050
對港幣咧，都去到八算啦。

275
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:06,420
咁所以咧，就係好多內地嘅買家咧。

276
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:14,260
根本就覺得，即係因為你百算咧，佢就好著數嘅，即係十五個percent根本。

277
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,360
對於佢嚟講咧，都係會唔會作用不大？

278
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:38,650
即係嗰個壓抑打擊嘅作用咧，係不大啦。因為咧，我就亦都睇到一啲地產代理咧，就對於嗰啲誒嚟自內地嘅買巴買家，佢已經預咗整定一啲表格。喂，你嗱你要預備咧呢？十

279
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,270
十五percent係要交呢個買家印花税，咁有啲內地嘅買家咧。

280
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,470
特別嗰啲首相。

281
00:47:47,750 --> 00:48:07,760
誒擁有大量嘅現金，佢啲根本都唔自在。總言之，佢嘅目標第一時間就係上樓。話知你十五percent啦，所以如果呢個十五percent，假如係再大幅啲提升嚇三十個percent、四十個percent，可能會真係先起到咧嗰個。

282
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,240
個打擊嘅作用，你哋有冇檢到十五percent都係少咧？呢個第一個問題。

283
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,550
第二個問題咧，就係嗰個額外印花税咧。

284
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:24,550
而家一手樓嘅誒物業咧，就唔需要交嘅。

285
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:35,250
咁因此咧，就而家嘅出現嘅問題咧，就係有啲發展商咧，佢哋有樓唔賣啊，個hold住先，有樓唔賣。

286
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:42,470
咁咧就誒，你哋有冇考慮咧？就係將嗰啲發展商hold住啲樓。

287
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,790
唔賣。

288
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:52,640
而對佢哋呢個噉樣嘅擁有啊，即係佢唔出售，都要視乎佢哋咧，就係誒。

289
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:12,930
都需要咧，係如果當佢要發售嘅時候，賣畀第三方嘅時候咧，都要交額外印花税，噉樣然後先可以咧起到一個阻壓嘅作用。因為呢個情形咧，就一如咧，好似啊梁振英佢個大賊，佢先前都係發展商，hold咗好多。

290
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:28,660
多年先出手畀佢，個情況都係差唔多，即係我舉例啫。咁因此咧，你係咪可以考慮咧？即係對發展商，如果hold住啲樓咧，即係呢個問題都係值得係要係有啲對應咧。兩個問題，主席。

291
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:50,270
係兩個問題，誒邊位回答咧？

292
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:58,200
looking at what happens overseas, particularly Singapore, that 15% should have the desired effect.

293
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:19,410
It it it is a value judgement at this stage, but we think that that rate would be appropriate, and we think it it in fact has already seen seen to be having some effect as a consequence of the announcement, damping the number of overseas buyers. But that

294
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,740
那 rate of course is something that

295
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:34,910
I'm sure members will discuss it in some detail. As far as the second question, which I think really it's not germane to this particular bill, but is a wider policy issue.

296
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:47,000
The certainly at this stage, I don't think we have any intention of applying for additional duties beyond those which we're proposing here.

297
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:47,970
嗯。

298
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,900
I think it's also quite an important point of principle that we.

299
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:14,390
have to accept that commercial decisions are taken on when to sell property. These are due to very many different reasons, not just issues of occupation permits and what have you. And those commercial decisions obviously will affect small numbers of units, but.

300
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,450
I think.

301
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:35,740
the the point we've we've already made is that in fact the total number of units that are currently vacant and unallocated is very very small. I think it's something like four percent of the total supply. So we don't think that that's a particularly large problem. But it's something we can.我我希望政府咧就

302
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,970
就呢個買家印花税咧，到一。

303
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:51,200
定嘅時間，你真係要檢討呢十五個percent真係，我話畀內地嚟自內地買家根本都視為成本一部分，根本可能咧，此都不起作用。

304
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,290
包佢舉證。

305
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,070
係林建峯議員。

306
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,520
多謝主席。

307
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:02,650
誒，即係對於任何措施咧，可以穩定香港樓價。

308
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,400
我哋都係支持嘅。

309
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,690
但係喺穩定樓價嘅同時咧。

310
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,030
我覺得任何嘅措施咧，即係都唔可以太太要物。

311
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,730
啊！嗱，正話秘書長講到，啊，有好多。

312
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,400
方法。

313
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:24,420
行唔通嘅，佢用not practical，不可行。

314
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,950
咁有啲又話做唔到嘅，即係亦都。

315
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,960
冇可能做得到嘅。

316
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:43,180
噉佢亦都用咗好大嘅篇幅咧嚟到講解有有關呢個B S D啊，對於公司買樓嗰個問題。

317
00:52:43,750 --> 00:53:03,760
咁實際上係咪真係行唔通咧？即係我都希望政府有關啊，政府咧可以再諗一諗，即係唔好成日喺個箱裏邊嚟到諗嘢啊。Think out of the box。噉啊，係唔係真係絕對不可行咧？因為你哋唔想做咧，即係你哋。

318
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:15,130
諗有關嘅措施嗰陣時咧，就係只係話邊一方面唔可行嘅，你有冇響啊邊一方面可行嗰方面嚟到開始諗咧？

319
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,000
嗱，我想問一問。

320
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:25,610
啊，因為你正話講到啦，因為有咗SSD嗰個措施之後咧，噉啊過去啊嗰一年。

321
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,430
誒嗰個賣樓嘅數字。

322
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,850
係跌咗嘅。

323
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,080
啊！但係跌咗啫，價錢係升咗嘅。

324
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,230
噉係有效，一係無效咧。

325
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:51,680
我唔知噉，如果成交跌咗嘅咧，即係話香港人買樓係少咗咯，少咗可能就係因為價錢升喎。咁即係香港人仲買買少咗樓，咁點搞咧？

326
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,850
咁嗱，我我我我想你哋提供一啲數字，過去三年。

327
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,780
真係用公司嚟到買樓。

328
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,730
買二千五百萬。

329
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,880
二千二千萬、二千五百萬、三千萬嘅有幾多？

330
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,050
佔整體嘅交交易誒嘅嘅數字。

331
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,150
咁誒，用公司嚟到買樓嘅。

332
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,520
過去嗰三年買咗。

333
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,960
即刻轉轉售嘅，唔好話即刻轉售啊！一年或者兩年。

334
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,810
三年。

335
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:35,490
轉售嘅有幾多？嗱，噉我哋先至實際上睇到用公司買樓嘅人。

336
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,260
嗰個意向。

337
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,540
噉你哋成日都講就話。

338
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,080
喂，做唔到㗎，因為我點知間公司做乜嘢啊？

339
00:54:44,640 --> 00:55:02,560
咁其實即係公司好易查㗎，你睇一睇嗰間公司做咩生意。嗱，當然有一啲咧係會誒買一間樓翻誒買一買一間樓翻嚟投資。嗰間公司咧有可能淨係擁有一個物業，單一物業，亦都有好多咧。

340
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:22,850
誒，佢買間樓翻嚟咧，就係畀員工誒去用嘅。噉我哋成日都提倡啊，我哋要對啲員工好啲啊，買間樓畀佢住，我覺得依樣嘢係好好嘅喎。咁如果你話買間樓翻嚟畀佢住，要抽多啲税嘅，咁有可能令到有啲僱主咧話，不如我唔我唔做啦。

341
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:42,860
噉你哋曾經答過就話，切你唔用公司買，唔係用私人名買啦。你諗下有冇一個老闆咁蠢，走去因為畀間樓嗰個僱員住，就用佢個名去買？你話如果真係反面嘅，最近我哋都睇到好多反面嘅場面啦。咁個嗰個僱住、嗰個僱員會唔會畀翻間樓畀你啊？即刻冇。嗱，依啲都係一個。

342
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,840
問題嚟嘅。

343
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:55,040
咁嗱，嗰啲數字我相信你今日未必可以完全畀到我哋，但係我我希望咧，誒，你哋即係諗清諗楚同埋。

344
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,570
提供依啲數字畀我哋。咁另外，嗱你而家就話三年。

345
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:14,530
好啦，如果公司買咗間樓，任何類型嘅公司，咁當然我哋係講香港人擁有嘅公司咧。噉佢三年都唔賣，係咪滿足咗你嗰個願意咧？個願意就係話你房子炒賣啊嘛。

346
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:31,780
咁依個你可唔可以有就住依個依個方向去諗一諗咧？即係即係我唔係好同意你一開頭就話不可行啊？係點樣不可行咧？或者我調翻轉頭，我希望你哋答我咧，就係有乜辦法可行咧？

347
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,740
唔該，主席。

348
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:41,550
好，誒？請問邊位答一兩個問題？係。Thank you, Chairman. Um, first, first point. Um.

349
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:51,980
Buyer stamp duty isn't really intended at all to deal with speculation. I think that must be understood. Buyer stamp duty is intended to give priority to Hong Kong people in buying property.

350
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:52,980
嗯。

351
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:13,290
By that we mean individuals, not companies, and that's the distinction we made. So I think that's an important point of principle. I think the other thing in relation to companies is that it's not a matter of us being unwilling or or unprepared to look at various suggestions. We have been looking at suggestions. We had them from example from Rida and from.

352
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:33,300
律師會，for example，we have looked at those in some detail. What we have not been able to do so far is come up with a mechanism that will allow us to effectively ensure that Hong Kong people are the are the the sole beneficiaries of this policy. Because it's so easy to transfer the ownership, the beneficial ownership of company.

353
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:46,320
It's deliberately done so in Hong Kong. It's one of the attractions of Hong Kong, but it also causes us the problem in this regard. So that's the reality. Perhaps my colleague can deal with the other questions.

354
00:57:46,660 --> 00:58:06,670
阿Mabel係咪可以補充啲數字啊？求先林議員就住個數字，因為有兩位議員求先都有提及個成效啊。咁咧就我都想提一提嘅就係話，過往誒我哋留意得到咧，我哋要提出B S D咧，正正就要管理翻個需求，因為喺非港人去買賣住宅誒樓宇嘅誒宗數咧，我哋睇到喺。

355
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:26,680
喺一零至一零一一咧，都係有一個大幅嘅上升。噉我可以畀少少誒數字畀大家睇一睇咧，就係誒喺二零一零年嘅時候咧，涉及一啲非港人去買賣住宅誒物業嘅誒百分比咧，係四點五percent，係講緊全部即係全部嘅誒嘅誒物。

356
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:46,690
而去到二零一一咧，就已經升到去六點五個percent㗎啦。咁喺自我哋喺誒一一誒十一月二零一二年推出咗呢一個措施之後咧，因為暫時咧嗰個月份都係比較少噉，但係我哋初步睇到咧呢一個嘅數字咧，涉及呢一方面嘅嗰個宗數咧，已經咧係有回。

357
00:58:46,690 --> 00:59:06,700
翻落嘅跡象係去到咧，得翻三個percent度，即係睇翻過去依兩三個月。咁當然而家咧都係一個好短嘅時間，個鐘數咧涉及一個全部嘅鐘數都係比較即係唔係咁多。咁但係咧，我哋係睇到有一個肯定嘅作用喺度。咁亦都想補充咧，頭先啊啊，秘書長。

358
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:26,710
所講咧，誒去公司嗰個嘅豁免是否係不可行咧？呢度其實我哋同誒運房局一樣咧，同誒地產商會同埋其他人士咧都有多次嘅討論，亦都係有就住有冇一啲措施係可行噉樣樣嚟去睇嘅。咁但係我諗咧，我哋睇過誒正正喺我哋嘅持。

359
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:46,720
份者都有提出，佢哋都話應該係可以用一啲要用一啲好窄嘅闊面咧嚟到處理，正正就係帶出咧。如果你係一個嘅誒公司裏邊去畀一啲闊面咧，的而且確係涉及一啲唔同嘅情況之下咧，會好容易出現一個股份轉讓嘅情況。噉就算你提出一個好窄嘅一個。

360
00:59:46,720 --> 01:00:06,730
個嘅豁免咧，嗰個股份轉讓嘅嗰個跟進咧，其實咧都係會出現有好多漏洞。我哋喺另一方面亦都聽到好強烈嘅社會嘅聲音咧，就係話喺公司如果透過股份轉讓而係將嗰個物業嘅權益咧而係轉移咧呢一方面咧係的而且確喺個法例上係誒好難執行，同埋咧係有好大。

361
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:14,380
嘅漏漏洞嘅，噉樣咧亦都係會抵觸咗咧成個嘅誒B S D推出嘅政策原意誒。

362
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:34,670
除此之外咧，律政司嗰邊咧，亦都係有一個好清晰嘅法律嘅睇法咧，就係話公司咧，我哋由始至終喺香港嘅法律體係裏邊咧，我哋都係以翻個公司作為一個實體，誒，從來都係以本地公司或者係非本地註冊嘅公司咧做一個分嘢，而唔會咧係因應嗰個公司嘅股東嘅身份咧。

363
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:41,830
嚟去再作一個嘅分野嘅，咁呢個咧，我哋喺法律上同埋政策上都係要必須要好清晰解釋畀議員知道。

364
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:42,840
係。

365
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,770
誒，跟住係啊，謝偉全議員。

366
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,560
誒，多謝主席。

367
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:54,470
誒，對於咧就呢個特別買家印花税，同埋呢個特別嗰個印花税咧。

368
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,320
去誒用嚟。

369
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,550
打機，呢個炒賣。

370
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:04,280
同埋管理嗰個誒需求咧，個精神原則上咧，我係好支持嘅。

371
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,950
噉啊！但係有幾點咧，我想或者誒細節想澄清一下。

372
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:18,100
第一咧就喺誒，頭先嗰度誒講過咧，就係其中有一樣嘢咧就有豁免嘅，關於呢個買家印花税。

373
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,840
咁亦都有個制定咗一啲即係退回税款嘅機制。

374
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,660
咁其中提及咧，就話如果係誒六年內重建咧。

375
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:43,220
嗰個就可以退翻嗰個税款。噉我想澄清一下咧，因為有陣時亦都好多案例買咗個物業之後咧，亦都唔係一定重建，可能係比較大規模嘅改造。

376
01:01:43,500 --> 01:02:03,510
或者係一啲大誒規模嘅維修，咁呢啲會唔會即係亦都會有誒呢個機制裏邊咧可以退回啲税款咧？因為呢啲好多情況咧，嚟其實對個物業市場嚟講啊，其實都有幫助，同埋亦都唔係一定重建啦。因為誒，如果個物業係好嘅。

377
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:10,290
即係可以誒大規模噉樣改造咧，其實都應該即係我覺得要支持啦。咁第一點。

378
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,460
第二點咧，就係誒關於誒嗰個改契個問題啦。

379
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:23,130
噉就誒改契有陣時咧，就係需要用通過換地嗰個方法。

380
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:34,790
咁換地嘅方法咧，如果係即係有呢個特別印花税咧，係因為咁咧，我我唔知或者澄清下係咪可以豁免咗咧？咁如果佢係三十六個月內，

381
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,240
誒，即係需要做呢樣嘢嘅，買咗之後。

382
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:46,330
咁第三樣嘢咧就係嗰個誒買家印花税咧，咁當然建成嘅物業。

383
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,070
即係要畀啦。

384
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,540
噉啊，地盤我相對應要畀㗎啦。

385
01:02:51,950 --> 01:03:07,530
誒噉啊，地盤咧有陣時咧係咪？因為我哋針對咧就係而家係住宅啊，咁有陣時地盤咧就未必話即係寫入，除咗個別有啲契裏邊寫寫定咗係一定住宅用途咧，有啲可能係。

386
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:28,260
不一定即係有彈性嘅，佢可能非工業用途咁嗰啲。我想澄清下呢，咁呢收呢個買家印花税係點收法咧？噉樣係咪分開咧？或者有陣時買整棟嘅樓宇個樓宇裏邊咧，可能地下鋪頭樓上住宅。我想澄清下啫，即係嗰個嗰個誒。

387
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:40,560
誒徵税嗰個基準係咩咧？噉樣嚇，唔該。好啊，誒邊位誒官員答咧？幾個技術性嘅問題係咪啊？Mr.王副局長。

388
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:52,210
係誒，關於謝議員第一個問題咧，就係關於改造同埋維修咧，係咪喺個誒條例草案裏邊有豁免咧？係冇嘅，呢個係我哋係要係淨係係真係。

389
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:04,490
拆咗個舊樓，如果有舊樓重建，係嘛？如果係買個空地翻嚟，空地上面重建起新嘅樓先有嘅。如果係純粹改造或者維修咧，喺現行呢個誒條例草案就冇豁免嘅。

390
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:25,030
咁至於第二點係改契咧，咁誒喺我哋條例出個闊面，即係屬於誒重建嘅情況之下咧，即係話買咗翻嚟，可能佢有一個誒地契裏邊嘅條款申請去改動咧。噉我哋如係計六六年嘅時限，可以申請退税嗰個咧？

391
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:30,340
係由去批准第一次改地批准之後，計六六六年嘅。

392
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,740
主席啊，好似冇答我問題。

393
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:40,490
即係第一樣，我我我講句，即係佢啱答嗰度咧，就係我講嗰個特別印花税。

394
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:46,140
因為你一定係即係一個買賣咁啦，你畀賣咗畀政府啫嘛，即係surrender嚇。

395
01:04:46,420 --> 01:05:06,430
噉啊！另外咧，我對於話即係話誒大量誒，即係改造嗰樣嘢咧，我都有好大保留，因為其實即係而家你即係鼓勵啲人咧，就係重建噉啊。有陣時呢方面咧，未必環保。試過有啲案例，我哋都唔想人即係好好地地咧拆咗個樓，因為呢個百分之十五咧。

396
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,250
其實對佢嚟講，好大有因嘅嚇。

397
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,190
係有冇補充？

398
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:33,660
Madam Chairman, I think that we accept the point about demolition not necessarily always being necessary. But I think again we have to focus back on the objective of this. What we're trying to do is to facilitate redevelopment where that is appropriate. If, for example, there's a building that someone prefers not.

399
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:47,510
to redevelop but to renovate and then sell on, then it's just from our point of view just another sale process. It's just a sequence of buying and selling processes. It doesn't involve this particular issue of redevelopment.

400
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,410
主席可唔可以？其實我提咗一啲技術問題，請佢哋書面答啦，可能答唔到佢哋。好啊。

401
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:55,780
圖。

402
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:11,140
係啊，黃局長，即係謝議員呢個問到問題話，如果係誒我哋係誒可能買翻嚟上邊有個樓樓啦嚇，可能樓下係鋪頭，上邊係住宅噉樣，咁需唔需要畀買家印花税咧？係。

403
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:31,430
因為呢個買家印花税咧，建議當中係針對係住宅物業嘅，所以係睇一個誒契約裏邊指定嘅用途嘅，就唔係睇實際用途。咁如果個契約指定用途係一個住宅物業咧，買笪地嗰陣時都會係要畀呢個買家印花税。但係呢個重建豁免咧可以適用嘅。如果將來佢重建咗之後係變成一個，

404
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:51,440
我就算係非住宅物業嘅，主席啊，我唔想嘥大家時間，因為佢哋答唔到啲技術問題，佢翻去問下啲技術嘅部門。好啊，你或者麻煩你誒一陣間，我哋誒都重新會要求政府邊一部分要提交啲書面補充嘅，咁請你都將具體嘅技術一陣間再重複一次，好嗎？好啊。噉就。

405
01:06:51,440 --> 01:07:11,450
誒有冇其他議員係希望第一輪發言嘅咧？噉啊，提一提醒咧，當時誒我哋討論第一個環節不在席嘅同事，因為第一個環節咧，秘書就提醒我哋要做一個利益申報。若然大家誒係希望發言，根據議事規則咧，我哋係誒需要作一個誒利益申報嘅。若然有直接或間接金錢。

406
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:31,460
最後我哋嘅議誒誒討論之後係通過咗，希望咧係會畀啊大家有一個書面嘅誒申報嘅安排。不過今日咧就即係如果大家考慮發言，我都建議大家申報啦。啊，梁君彥議員，誒，我我我第一次發言，我我申報啊，我有誒，我亦我一定有我有物業啊，我有公司都揸住物業嘅。誒，我諗。

407
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,310
即係誒，我辭離咗，但係。

408
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,370
我就覺得，即係誒。

409
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,460
開依個。

410
01:07:40,990 --> 01:08:01,000
啊！依個印花税咧，誒，去阻止外國人誒嚟買樓咧，依個誒，當然我唔同意，但係我唔反對嘅。但係對於依個誒公司誒香港人揸嘅香港公司買咧，誒，我覺得係有意見嘅，因為事實上香港好多。

411
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:21,010
多公司都係啊用公司去揸，有買樓嘅，佢未必係一個炒樓嘅啊原因。噉我覺得即係秘書長講話啊，用咗好多方法都諗唔通去做依樣嘢。我覺得學似啊林建峯議員講，應該即係政府係諗諗一個即係星歐嗰度幫。

412
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:24,020
因為依個嘢咧，就係啊。

413
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:44,310
無可厚非，你要穩定樓市去徵一個外國人誒嚟香港買嘅噉。當然，依個係對我哋香港自由社會係有個重大影響。但係而家你係再加埋喺商業社會嗰度有個影響咧啊，我係反對嘅。我咧就係想問一個比較technical少少嘅問題。

414
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,980
係啊，頭先啱啊嘛。

415
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:54,030
謝偉全議員嘅，其實有好多樓喺誒旺角等等嘅地方咧，係商住嘅。

416
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,370
啊！

417
01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:02,390
有一啲地方咧，即係我有間公司都有個鋪嘅，有有有鋪位，但係上邊咧亦都有。

418
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:20,120
一樓有單位嘅，但係商住嘅，咁如果係商住嘅，係應該又唔需要畀買家人拍水啊。雖然我賣咗係商住，噉我可以商可以住啊。咁政府係點樣睇依樣嘢咧？

419
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,550
係邊位回答咧？

420
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:42,930
相住係阿黃副局長。好啦，就住梁議員講嘅問題咧，其實喺誒一九九一年，我哋修訂個印花税條例咧，係針對咗係一種分開咗係住宅物業同非住宅物業交易，已經係有個分別嘅喺税例上喺印花税條例上邊。咁住宅物業嚟講咧，係簡單嚟講係。

421
01:09:42,930 --> 01:10:02,940
係根據嗰個入夥紙裏邊批出嚟嗰個用途，或者指定用途，或者其他地契裏邊指定用途，就唔係睇個物業實際係畀個使用人係點樣用去決定呢個係住宅物業定係非住宅物業嘅。係咪入夥紙裏邊只得一個用途，唔會有灰色地帶嘅咧？如果噉，你噉。係啦，冇錯啦。噉。

422
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,930
咁即係喺嗰啲舊嘅唐樓嗰啲噉嘅嘢，佢唔係。

423
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,650
純住宅噉就唔使畀啦，係咪？

424
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:23,070
是否咧？噉啊睇嗰個契約咯嚇。如果契約話明係個指定用途係住宅嘅，噉樣咧？即係如果冇指定用途係住宅嘅，就唔使畀啦。

425
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:29,120
契約上邊通常會有指定用途嘅，我哋未。如果啲個案係冇指定用途。

426
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,430
好，誒，下一位咧就係張雨仁議員。

427
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,870
主主席，我就真係聽得唔清楚啦，我就。

428
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,080
冇乜物業嘅人嚟嘅。

429
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:46,320
但係我咧就因為飲食業咧有好多時申請啲酒牌啊、食肆牌。

430
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,540
其實我嘅記憶咧，即係我就唔係好識啦，噉啊，即係我講咗先啦。

431
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,770
即係相處就冇講，你係。

432
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:02,340
仲有用途乜啊嘛？你可商可住啊嘛嗱。而家我講緊譬如美利都大廈，我細個嗰度住嘅。

433
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:14,100
細過我入夥嘅時間，好多係做住宅嘅。而家我諗，我翻入去咧就冇乜住宅嘅啦。噉啊，前手又用嚟做商業。我買咗，亦都可能我嚟做商業嘅。

434
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:34,520
咁其實呢啲點咧，我唔知啊。唐樓啊，更加啦，好多我哋見到嘅唐樓，即係雙住有雙住用途啊嘛，唔係話地下個鋪位樓下係可商可住啊嘛。咁咁而家而家就問緊你，就係話喂，咁如果之前我嗰上手又係商緊嘅，我買嚟又係預備。

435
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,900
從商嘅，噉我唔係住嘅，噉我使唔使畀先？

436
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,170
係咪邊位邊位官員答咧？

437
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:48,170
一具體問題，定係阿王副局長，你可唔可以回應咧？

438
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:55,200
或者我請我同事阿康生去處理開呢啲問題，幫我作答。好，阿康生係嘛？O K。

439
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,980
可唔可以大？誒，你對準個麥好似未收得到，係嘛？

440
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,190
未開咪。

441
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:03,430
係有個掣要撳嘅，係啦。

442
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,190
喺前。

443
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,540
係咪？

444
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,080
自己係咯。

445
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:31,030
冇制嘅，咁即係應該要好OK得啦，開咗米啦。O K，誒根據印花税條例咧，就係有一個定有一個定義嘅，即係話咩係一個非誒住宅嘅物業，就係咧佢唔可以係用，即係根據頭先誒講嗰啲入夥紙啊，或者係土地嗰個契約咧，佢就唔可以係誒。

446
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:36,710
全部或者係部分咧用作呢個住宅用途，咁咧就係一個非住宅物業。

447
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:54,280
咁所以咧就我哋睇就係話，如果係噉嘅時候咧，佢買賣先至係可以咧，係豁免嗰個誒賣家印花税嘅，即係佢唔可以部分或者係全部咧，佢唔可以用作註冊用途咧，噉就又豁免。但係如果唔係嘅話咧，就係要誒要執即係做呢個P.S.D嘅。

448
01:12:54,750 --> 01:13:14,760
主席唔簡單，即係明，即係佢嘅講法就係，相住嘅就都因為可以，你可以住就係要收，冇得豁免，係咪噉嘅意思？佢嘅講法據我瞭解就按入夥字，因為佢後尾後尾嗰橛我又按拗咗啦。好啊，可唔可以再重新講清楚啲？即係如果簡單嚟講，就係話，如果嗰間樓咧，佢嗰個誒，譬如咩聽，即係嗰嗰。

449
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:24,230
個批准用途咧可以用嚟到去做住宅用途咧，噉就係誒要咧係畀嗰個誒物業發展局。

450
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,430
好誒，下一位咧係有胡志偉議員。

451
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:47,720
誒多謝主席。其實我係想問下咧，因為買家印花税其實都唔係誒，可能係唔係香港獨有嘅一個係税款，因為為咗咧係即係阻止呢一個外地嘅係人士咧係進入自己嘅本國市場咧係進入進行呢一個炒賣。我想了解下咧，即係。

452
01:13:47,720 --> 01:14:01,830
其他國家喺類似嘅係即係安排上邊咧，係點樣樣做嘅？咁咧，第一個，第二個就係話，即係當中一定會牽涉到其他國家會係有關嘅一啲即係公司上邊。

453
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:22,120
係去購買即係當地嘅物業嘅時間，有冇一啲嘅係即係豁免嘅安排？咁呢個我咪可以參考翻嚇。因為頭先我聽好多同事都講，就係其實諗嚟諗去就係政府就話冇乜好竅啦。咁但係我就唔知道喺外國會唔會有啲好嘅竅咧，係可以引用喺喺香港呢一種情境。因為大家都想呢一個引。

454
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,240
花費嘅安排咧，係能夠真正咧係。

455
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:34,180
處理到誒，針對性噉樣樣咧，係處理到係即係誒外陸外地嘅人咧，嚟到香港咧炒賣香港嘅物業。

456
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,600
好啊，有冇做過呢方面嘅研究咧？O K。

457
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:59,440
We have actually studied both Singapore and Macau, which are the nearest references. But I think you need to bear in mind that what applies in one jurisdiction doesn't always necessarily translate easily into the Hong Kong context, given our particular circumstances.理解嘅呢個。所以那係一個好重要嘅原則。可能。

458
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:19,450
係啊，陳副秘書長嚇少少補充嘅啫。其實等於啊啊，常任秘書長頭先提到嘅啦，我哋誒其實喺鄰近嘅地區咧，都其實正正都係面對緊呢一個對於個樓宇嘅誒需求咧係好大噉，而可能會有一啲外地嘅誒居民咧，佢哋係想喺嗰個。

459
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:39,460
當地咧去買賣一啲物業咧，以致咧影響到本地嘅市民咧，未必能夠佢個需求可以照顧到。咁所以喺個誒討論同埋研究嘅過程咧，我哋係審視咗譬如誒鄰近嘅地方，譬如好似新加坡啊，甚至澳洲啊、誒澳門啊都有咁一個比較最近似嘅一啲嘅例子咧。喺新加坡同埋澳門咧，都係分別咧。

460
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:59,470
係有推出一啲類似嘅，針對一啲非誒佢哋嘅本地居民嘅誒一啲買家印花税。咁而喺新加坡嚟講咧，佢哋係早於二零一一年嘅十二月咧，就已經係第一次推出依一個噉樣嘅買家印花税。澳門咧就喺二零一二年嘅十二誒十月咧就推出嘅。

461
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:07,030
咁誒，而佢哋喺誒考慮依一個嘅税款嘅時候咧，同樣咧公司咧都係冇得豁免嘅。

462
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,010
好，阿劉慧卿議。

463
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:30,590
主席，主席，首先係咪要要申報啊？係，若然你認為有利益嚇，噉就申報。我唔知我自己住緊喺個地方啊，呢個誒其他議員嘅申報都係話自己有物業噉嘅啫。係啦，係係，我自己係住緊喺度嚇，噉就唔好意思，我遲咗嚟嚇。主席，唔知問題有冇問過？噉我就想問下政府當局咧，即係誒，即係其實原則上。

464
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:50,600
我都支持呢個做法啦，但係就而家好似話嗰啲效力都好似冇曬，啲樓價又猛咁升，即係啲市民都即係感到非常之憤怒啦，即係覺得當局咧係處理房屋問題咧係非常之咧係即係即係好唔到位咯，即係而且佢亦都睇唔到。

465
01:16:50,600 --> 01:17:10,610
咧係喺誒未來咧係即係會有啲好轉噉就真係希望當局係著力去做噉就誒。當然你話如果冇呢個咧，可能仲升到炳砰砰添。主席嚇噉，但係真係呢個咧係市民覺得係幫到佢咯，所以真係好多市民係非常之感到即係非常之憤怒嘅主。

466
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,010
值。

467
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:19,540
我想問下咧，即係有啲人咧就係反對嘅，反對嗰個公司嗰個，尤其是主席嗰個話話唔好搞嗰度。

468
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:25,440
噉樣有啲就話咧，嗰啲咧係可能咧就係用買嗰啲貴價樓嗰啲啊，尤其是。

469
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:45,730
咁其實從一個角度，如果係買貴價樓，可能變到因為有咗呢個招咧，係咪貴價樓就少咗嗰啲肯出好多錢嗰啲人買，嗰啲會唔會平翻啲咧？益到市民咧？你哋有冇從嗰個角度睇下咧？即係我哋真係想到位幫到想置業嗰啲市民，令到可。

470
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:58,410
可以喺佢可以負擔嘅情況之下，而家就得好多樓，佢哋係完全冇得負擔。咁當局有冇諗過，即係係咪有啲正面啲嘅效果會出到嚟咧？

471
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:19,840
係邊位回答咧？係咪啊？常秘阿陳副秘書長喺阿阿劉議員誒，剛才誒參加之前咧，其實我哋就住嗰個措施嘅成效咧，我哋就畀咗一啲數據。不我我簡單，你簡單講講，唔好意思嚇嚇，簡單講講咧，就係整體，因為我哋依一兩個嘅招數咧，其實都係主要管理。

472
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:39,850
嘅需求，我哋希望將嗰個有關嘅供應咧，能夠集中處理咗本地居民個住屋需要。咁所以咧，其實我哋睇到整體嗰個嘅誒物業交投嘅數字咧，由二零一零年咧十五多萬宗咧，降到去二零一二年，直至到十二月為止咧，係得翻九萬宗咁而。

473
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:59,860
而當中咧涉及一啲誒非港人嘅買賣嘅物業咧，嗰個嘅誒百分比咧，已經係由二零一零年或者一一年高於六點五個percent咧，去到最近為止依幾個月咧係三個percent到。咁當然咧，依個推出嘅措施咧係幾個月嘅時間，總數咧係整體嘅總數比較少。

474
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:19,870
噉，但係我哋睇到咧，嗰個成效係肯定嘅。咁正如當初財政司司長誒提出嘅時候咧，我哋推出呢個措施，主要係希望喺嗰個transactions嗰個買賣宗數嗰度咧反映到嗰個嘅需求咧係可以有得壓抑。誒，至於個樓價咧，有啲人士有提出會唔會係針對一啲？

475
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:39,880
貴價樓啊，或者一啲唔同嘅價錢嘅物業咧，先至去做一啲針對性嘅措施。我哋就覺得咧係不宜由一個價錢嗰度咧嚟到做一個入手。始終成個樓市嗰個嘅誒泡沫嘅風險咧係一個整體嘅。其實嗰個嘅信息係非常之緊要。如果我哋喺個物業嘅價格嗰度作出一個分野。

476
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:59,890
嘅咧，其實咧呢個亦都無助於去全面去管理整體嘅需求，因為誒始終咧嗰個係一個市場嘅力量。誒買家咧，亦都係會隨住佢哋自己嘅需要咧，可能喺唔同嘅樓價方面嘅樓咧，佢哋都會有一方面嘅需求。咁所以我哋覺得咧，應該係要一個全面整體嘅措施咧。

477
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:19,900
而唔係用一個樓價咧嚟到做分野咧，你係比較咧係最具成效嘅。啊，主席，我冇話叫你樓價做分野啊，小姐，你聽清楚啦。而且亦都唔係話去壓一個需求，市民係有個需求要有屋住啊。你壓抑佢個需求做乜嘢啫，小姐？你應該提供個供應就令。

478
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:39,910
令到市民就有你就壓抑個需求噉啊，個個瞓曬街啊嚇，個個四誒四個人、八個人住劏房啊嘛，壓抑到咩？即係我都唔知當局點樣去諗嘢嘅。即係你而家就供應唔到，你就壓抑嗰個嚇需求。但係真係人你要住屋㗎嘛？如果你而家咪咪你買咗嚟去炒炒炒十幾間噉就唔同。

479
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:59,920
啫，我希望你睇清咗個情況。我個問題咧，主席就係話嗱，你而家都講係少咗啲外地人啦嚟買啦，即係我哋有個擔心就係話啊誒，唔係擔心，即係個睇法就係話啊，用公司嗰啲好多係買貴嘅，噉你而家就喺嗰度嚇用辣椒，噉啊嗰啲嘅需求就可能會跌咗啦。

480
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:19,930
咁如果跌咗，咁個價我都希望跌咁解啫。主席嚇呢個邏輯都唔係咁複雜啦，係咪啊？我希望當局有啲官員係明白我嘅諗法，同埋可唔可以直接答下咧。即係當然個價你你冇得估，但係即係有冇噉嘅趨勢，即係畀市民啊可以唞下氣得唔得？而家真係好辛苦，你哋。

481
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:24,460
你知唔知道市民為房屋嘅問題辛苦得好緊要啊！

482
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,500
好有冇個趨勢係？Let me let me try and respond to this.

483
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:39,280
Before the honourable member came in, I did explain that the reason behind this situation we're in isn't caused by one factor. It's a number of different factors.

484
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:59,870
包括了 influx of capital from overseas. That's one of the issues that we can address through this measure. But of course, the other reason is, as you quite rightly point out, inadequate supply of units, and that we must also address. And indeed, I would point out that the chief executive in his policy address set out extensive measures.

485
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:17,040
terms of land supply to deal with that particular measure. I would also point out that in the next four years there are going to be something like 67,000 units coming onto the market. We believe from in the private sector alone. On top of which there will be

486
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,930
七十五千。

487
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:39,220
公共 rental housing units and a further seventeen thousand home ownership scheme units coming onto the market again in the next five years. These are the direct supply side measures which are also being taken forward. But what we're talking about here are measures specifically designed to deal with this influx of capital and to give priority to Hong Kong buyers.

488
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:59,310
for these new units that are coming on stream, 女議員，香港人民唔 want to wait four or five years. By then, CY Leung would have stepped down already. They want more immediate measures. 女議員嘅意見，你哋聽到啦。阿謝偉俊議員，我都落台啦。主席，主席，我申報係有經有限公

489
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,590
公司係置物業嘅。

490
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:20,920
主席，我哋嗌啲政治嘅口號咧，雖然好聽，但係就即係幫唔到件事嘅。即係我希望大家都實事求是處理咧。因為我比較擔心咧，就係我哋會唔會係一個誒中國人又講説話兩句啦，一個叫做斬腳子被沙蟲啊，一個叫做誒食砒霜毒老虎，兩個都係話意思咧，我哋用一。

491
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:40,930
啲嘅措施咧，畀一啲所謂嘅唔好嘅嘢，但係其實個約係太重嘅，係導致到咧，今日係成就成件事咧，係所謂係好好啊ridiculous，好好好啊過曬火位。咁呢一次咧，香港咁多年嚟以成功嘅最基本嘅誒好多原則咧，包括我哋係誒冇有。

492
01:23:40,930 --> 01:24:00,940
任何歧視性嘅處理，我哋本港同外國人嘅誒，無論喺價錢上啊，好多地方上都係。如果我哋開始歧視嘅話咧，我哋開始係迪士尼又收唔同嘅價錢啊，跟住我哋話買奶粉又唔同價錢啊，誒甚至係誒呢個誒金沙朱古力都唔同價錢嘅話，咁幾幾幾時係沒完沒了咧？即係如果用

493
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:20,950
個方法去處理呢個問題嘅話，呢啲係完全違反咗我哋最基本嘅原則嘅。第二咧就係個人同埋公司方面咧，香港咁多百多年嚟咧，我哋要一個資本主義制度咧，公司同個人咧呢種依種係一種好好由長以久嘅做方做生意嘅方式、經商嘅方式。我哋一下子為咗要目前嘅好短暫嘅一個問題。

494
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:40,960
好短時咁處理咗呢啲問題咧，假設可以處理到嘅話嚇，而破壞曬我哋最根基嘅我哋香港，一路全世界都都覺得香港係好好嘅最好嘅嘢嘅話咧，我哋一下子咁做法咧，呢方面我哋有冇做足曬準備研究？究竟我哋而家係做緊啲乜嘢？即係我哋呢個政府太多嘢咧，係好短時噉，係好好多呢張。

495
01:24:40,960 --> 01:25:00,970
reaction咧，見到啲嘢就做乜嘢啊？都唔諗曬我哋香港咁多年嚟嘅基礎傳統同埋長遠嘅影響嘅。咁呢個先係我最擔心。反而我唔係而家暫時未去到嗰個逐條逐條睇嘅階段。但係我誒留意留意到阿劉建爾，即係我哋嘅同事喺上面咧，都喺度好遺憾地，今次佢唔可以參加我哋一齊處理啲問題。我相信佢喺。

496
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:20,980
同我會一樣嘅，即係我哋要好關好緊張呢啲噉嘅基本嘅原則嘅。咁今次咧，我好遺憾地咧，誒政府又一次咧令我非常之失望。好多我哋崇尚香港嘅自由人非常之失望，就係我哋搞緊乜嘢？即係如果有啲議員、有啲政客、有啲市民係大聲疾呼咁嗌話：喂誒遠水不能救近火啊！咁

497
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:32,450
咁究竟而家呢個火係救得嚟嘅話，我哋其實都已經係過曬嗰個最關鍵嘅時候，係咪有八萬五嘅翻版咧？咁呢啲係問都要諗嘅嘢嚟嘅。噉我希望，當我唔知有冇你哋做過一啲嘅誒研究咧？

498
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:52,740
剛才畀個例子就係話新加坡同澳門就唔係好嘅例子啦嚇。我講自由市場嚟講，嗰啲係比較經濟規劃都係多少少嘅。澳洲係點樣？我就唔係好清楚。澳洲有好似而家你建議噉嘅限制，因為我自己都喺澳洲都有啲物業嘅，但係完全冇呢種噉嘅問題出現嘅。而其他誒比較自由嘅西方國家更

499
01:25:52,740 --> 01:26:12,750
更加唔會有呢一種噉嘅誒歧視性嘅，甚至係呢情瘋狂式嘅限制，啲公司同埋個人嘅限制，呢啲冚唪唥咧破壞咗香港做生意做一個出誒國際城市嘅基本原則嚟。咁呢一方面咧，你哋有冇真係諗過誒係點搞法㗎？即係我即係我唔知點。

500
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:32,760
講落去，但係因為我覺得咧，你哋而家咁做法咧，係完全係係誒好短視咁去處理一個問題。而何況咧，啲樓咧，如果真係話係誒，你哋研究話有四點percent最高係六點五，跟住跌翻三啦。咁究竟有冇再細翻研究嗰啲樓咧？嗰個price range係乜嘢咧？嗰啲percent？

501
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:52,770
提出上落唔係淨係話全唔係cross the board，唔係真係影響香港民生嗰啲一般嘅住客、一般市民所住嘅樓嗰種嘅誒幅度啊，定還是係一啲嘅真係貴價樓啊、山頂豪宅呢種價？除咗話睇嗰個上落嘅percent條之外咧，我諗你要小心睇下嗰個range啊。嗰啲而家你嘅做法係咪真係係in

502
01:26:52,770 --> 01:27:12,780
劈到嗰啲，淨係impact到嗰啲投資者咧，定還是係所有香港市場所有市民都受惠咧？如果你哋搞咁大動作咧，亦都追到落嚟，個影響個percentage好細，影響咗個幅度係針對咗，只係其實好少嘅一啲投資者嘅話咧，咁呢個係可能未必值得嘅。即係香港呢個噉嘅成個基石畀你哋係斷送喺你手上嘅。

503
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,060
噉你哋有冇諗清楚呢啲問題咧，主席？

504
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,660
係邊位回答啦？

505
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:37,630
Deal with a couple of points and then I'll pass it on. Perhaps Western economies, a number of Western economies do have restrictions, including I believe the UK is considering something. Provide examples, like concrete examples of all these countries, all this data. Yeah. Well, as I say, we we can provide that. But let me just quote. I tried to buy property in Australia. I couldn't.

506
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:49,730
做，因為我試過買的物業，不幸的是，受限制，對海外買家。他們有這些措施。那是當和何時？這係某啲嘢，係喺澳洲好多年嘅。

507
01:27:50,010 --> 01:28:10,020
It already exists. Yes, the UK is currently debating similar provisions to restrict overseas buyers. Again, it's a it's an issue not just affecting our economy, but many economies around the world. And we we are aware of these things. But what we're trying to do is to deal with a specific situation and.

508
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:30,030
As I said in my introduction, these are definitely measures in extremis. We have to do this because of the situation we face. We don't want them to be in place any longer than the need to be, because fundamentally they are interference in the market. There's no doubt about that. But we're doing it consciously. We're not doing it.

509
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:32,620
sort of by default, as you're suggesting.

510
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:53,100
主席可唔可以要求比較詳細啲嘅？誒，我相信可能有同事都提過㗎啦，就係關於其他國家有呢啲税嘅，佢哋點樣做法嘅，幾時開始嘅，佢哋咩基礎嘅，或者係個成效點？我哋想多啲研究。交住先。好啊，誒，陳秘書長有啲補充係嘛？誒，阿謝議員嗰個提問咧，譬如喺澳洲嚟講咧個年份，其實佢。

511
01:28:53,100 --> 01:29:13,110
喺一九七五年咧，就通過咗一個act，佢裏邊嘅誒內容咧，其實就係對於一啲外國嘅投資喺香喺佢哋當地嘅一啲嘅房地產咧，係需要有一啲嘅誒限制。咁而一啲外地人，如果佢哋購買，主要佢哋係講個地，或者係包括一啲樓房咧，係要直情得到佢哋個當地嘅政府。

512
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:33,120
嘅事先嘅批准，咁所以咧喺香港而家我哋今天提出嘅呢一個兩個嘅措施，特別係嗰個買家印花税咧，我哋唔係禁止外國人喺香港買，我哋其實就係喺嗰個税務嗰度咧，係希望藉著嗰個財政上邊咧係會加重翻少少嘅財政嘅負擔咧。其實正正。

513
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:53,130
經濟回應頭先，劉議員所講，我哋好想管理一啲外國人喺香港住屋嘅嗰個需求咧，嚟到咧將而家嗰個供應咧能夠優先去照顧處理我哋港人嗰個住屋需求。噉我哋咧唔係去禁止佢哋買，我哋喺嗰個財政個税務嗰度咧係加咗一個十五percent咧。

514
01:29:53,130 --> 01:30:13,140
令到佢哋咧會係考慮喺呢一方面咧誒嗰個嘅需求咧係能夠我哋可以更好噉樣嘅管理嘅。噉我哋可以會後再提。好啊，麻煩你會後再補充翻啲資料。誒，阿何修蘭議員。係啊，主席。嗱，我我當然咧要申報啊，係咪？即係有寫物業屋企嚇，但係我唔會短時間賣，賣咗瞓街咩？係咪？

515
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:33,150
咁咧嗱，主席，我我就歡迎當局咧去壓止炒風嘅。我只係恐怕無效，或者係嗰個涵蓋面不足嘅啫，即係你加重佢嗰個誒炒賣嘅成本，係未必有效，因為我哋都見好多股票都遠超佢嘅實際資產值。

516
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:52,110
閒閒地十幾倍甚至幾廿倍嘅啦，有即係你只要炒嗰個覺得會有人承託，噉你就繼續炒落去嘅啦。噉就即係如果真係可以分開兩個市場，一個係要嚟炒嘅，一個要嚟住嘅，就冇緊要。但係而家呢個措施咧，我睇唔到佢點樣能夠分開到兩個市場啊！

517
01:30:52,390 --> 01:31:12,400
即係其實香港作為一個商業城市咧，啲人中意炒，即係炒到幾高都好，只要唔好影響我哋香港市民嗰個實際居住嘅需要咧，我就真係話知佢。所以頭先啊，劉慧卿議員講得啱嘅，你唔可以淨係增加佢個炒賣成本，係要增加供應。咁而家嗰個誒建

518
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:32,410
屋公屋或者係居屋嗰個進度咧，就係遠遠不能夠達到呢個成效。咁另外咧，主席，我亦都係恐怕佢個涵蓋面唔夠。誒，頭先亦都有同事跟進，會唔會一啲舊樓其實係商業用途，不過而家已經係轉咗做住宅用途嗱？呢啲個案咧，我。

519
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:52,420
我處理過，因為中上環嗰度咧，確實開埠嘅時候咧，就好多商業樓宇。我哋做就係畀你地鐵收地啊，或者市區重建嘅時候咧，都見過呢啲個案。因為咧就話佢嗰個係商業樓宇，但係明明做咗住宅㗎啦，但係個賠償咧都賠得好差，六百幾尺樓。

520
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,260
賠一百八十萬畀人啊！真係幾～

521
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:02,460
即係真係幾可恥啊！呢個政府，咁咧我就想政府問，即係去睇翻。

522
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:05,480
其實仲有幾多流語？

523
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:14,400
已經係好舊嘅，原來嘅嘅契約係寫住商業用途，但係實際上係住緊人。

524
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,840
因為如果你即係，

525
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:37,270
推一個措施出嚟涵蓋唔到呢啲咧，係一個漏洞嚟㗎。咁所以主席，我就請嘅當局就翻去做一做盤點，睇下好舊嘅舊區裏邊咧，都會唔會有呢情況出現。因為如果漏招嘅話咧，你又反為累到嗰啲居民啊，即刻走去炒佢嗰啲啦。噉啊變咗佢。

526
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:51,150
佢哋即係就算有啲舊嘅樓宇買賣，可以用平啲嘅錢去買啲四十年樓咧，嗰啲都即係嗰個誒誒個代價係非常之高，就反為累到佢添。唔該，主席。係可唔可以做到呢一個資料咧？

527
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,950
有冇邊位官員先回答阿何議員嘅提問？

528
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:57,940
係上任秘書長。

529
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:18,320
To be honest with you, I think it would be extremely difficult to gather that sort of information without doing a comprehensive survey. And in any case, finding out the current user for a particular unit within a particular building would require rights of access, which a general survey wouldn't have. I mean, the problem is.

530
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:25,470
It's something that we're trying to deal with anyway in the in a different context. So I think it would be very difficult to get that sort of information. I'm afraid.

531
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:45,890
啊！主席係難嘅，但係你推出個新嘅措施咧，你真係會會殺錯良民，即係直情係累到人㗎嘛。因為本來唔炒佢嗰啲嘅，因為涵蓋唔到嗰度啊。忽然間，大家就去炒埋嗰啲，就即刻炒到貴曬。咁所以，當我哋做一樣新嘢嘅時候，真係要全面啲咯。唔該，主席。

532
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:46,260
係。

533
01:33:47,450 --> 01:34:00,160
我 must repeat, the buyer's stamp duty is not targeting speculators. The whole point of this is to target overseas buyers, not speculators. So that the the issue is slightly different in this case.

534
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,440
好誒，第二輪咧，阿田北俊議員。

535
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,580
主席，同級，May I just ask you？

536
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:11,480
That or follow-up question to honourable Paul J.

537
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:19,330
我用嚟look up to international financial centres like London, New York, I don't know Paris, Tokyo.

538
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,340
now we're saying we look up.

539
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:36,740
到新加坡和Macau，我係like Singapore，fresh air，casual lifestyle，但係佢哋restrict，people having long hair，long hair legislator certainly will not be in Singapore，chewing gums，newspaper circulation。

540
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:42,930
所以，what are the city? The ones that I mentioned, international financial centre.

541
01:34:43,210 --> 01:35:03,220
是實際上有啲所謂歧視、保護主義措施，對外資徵收關税。我諗，如果呢個做法，外資投資者可以爭辯，假設股市有啲過熱，會唔會推出一個叫做BSD的措施？

542
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:04,620
against foreign buyers.

543
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,940
How do we balance the international financial centre?

544
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:29,310
特別行政區區域的香港versus， the things we want to do， which is very important Hong Kong people， but in overall context， long term this that something， government had already thought out， maybe my suggestion as I've mentioned earlier， since Duncan mentioned that in four years time the private sector will

545
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:47,280
68,000 property prices should stabilise。我 tend to agree with that。所以，why don't you put a cap on 48 months？then at least I can tell my American friends，hey，this is temporary measure，only 48 months，because our property prices going out of whack。所以，那係我第一個問題。第二個問題，我係想。

546
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,360
ask。

547
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:56,380
是That there's still a confusion on this BSD. It seems that there's a BSD on buying a property, which is actually the building.

548
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,710
and not the land.

549
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:04,070
所以如果我買一間屋喺個 Peak，個 Whole House 喺個 Peak 值百萬，我 have to pay for it。

550
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:10,480
The question I like to ask is: the owner demolishes the building, and just becomes a piece of land.

551
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:30,770
You currently have no BSD on land because when I just tendered a piece of government land last week on狗頭山，I don't have to pay BSD，and that's why yesterday，New World together with Man 4，put the land on春華，they don't have to pay BSD。所以，the concept if you buy land no BSD，you buy building yes。所以，如果。

552
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:34,420
Demolish the building on the land and sell the land, they could get around it.

553
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:41,360
係邊位回答咧？係，answer the first part，然後ask Mr. Wong to to deal with the technical point。

554
01:36:42,870 --> 01:37:02,880
As I said before, we devise these particular measures to suit Hong Kong circumstances. But in doing our due diligence, we of course look at models that exist overseas. It doesn't really matter whether it's Singapore, Macau, Australia or elsewhere. These are simply reference points. What we've devised is something that's particularly tailored.

555
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:18,130
Tailored for the Hong Kong context, and that's that's important. But I would point out, apart from Australia, I understand that London is looking at this issue of restricting. Yeah, but we're looking. I mean, it's the same issue, isn't it? Well, they may do it too.

556
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:38,420
What I'm saying is, we are not unique in the world as a major city that has some issues about the influx of foreign capital into the property market. We've chosen this particular route. Whether or not others choose the same route, the issue still remains. The other point, and I'm glad you raised it, the the issue of you know will it be

557
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:44,170
sufficient to say in four years' time when the 67,000 comes on that we allow it to lapse.

558
01:37:44,450 --> 01:38:04,460
實際上，問題是much more complicated than simply supply. One of the biggest issues is quantitative easing in the US. It's the low interest rates which the US and Europe are deliberately putting in place. These are issues which affect the the the flow of money around the world. Now that could happen. The changes could happen very very.

559
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:09,280
very quickly. For example, if interest rates go up here.

560
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:23,880
within say two years, we wouldn't want to be trapped into something that's in place for four years. We would want to react quickly. So that's why we're saying we need to have the flexibility to react to the market situation. I like to hear that.

561
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:44,170
主席，所以政府係説，我們唔應該甚至建議三或四個年，他們可能在六個月內把它拿走。作為我説，我們建議我們有一個相對快速的機制，能夠做到這一點。這已經是法案的一部分。如果我們需要，我們必須能夠快速行動。第二個問題，黃副主席。

562
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:46,390
個第二個問題咧，就係話。

563
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:49,480
係，如果係政府批地出嚟。

564
01:38:49,770 --> 01:39:02,550
第一次批地出嚟，係買達住宅用途嘅物業咧，就唔需要畀個買家印花税嘅。但係如果喺個二手市場裏邊買一個空地咧，係需要係畀買家印花税。

565
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,420
係有唔同嘅。

566
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,180
嗯。

567
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:20,410
誒對唔住，好短嘅跟進，即係嗰塊空地，如果寫商業，其他啲就唔使酒店唔使。如果個嗰塊空地係住宅咧，政府意思都要畀嘅，係咪噉嘅意思？你嘅理解係正確嘅。嚇，OK，好。誒，石禮謙議員。

568
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:21,530
預借。

569
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:34,340
就我誒再畀啲機會啊，Mr Prescott去解釋下佢嗰個思維同埋佢個佢個嗰個個logic啊，即係嚇。佢話咧就係依個成個BSD係保護香港人。

570
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:54,660
去買香港樓，佢就唔可以唔希望外國人或者係內地嘅居民去買香港樓。咁如果係去保護香港人買香港樓，點解香港人用香港公司買樓就要要畀多十五個percent咧？要第一個，因為佢點解都解釋唔到，佢即係佢佢個佢。

571
01:39:54,660 --> 01:40:14,670
佢佢就算佢佢話依個選擇，我唔畀你選擇噉。依個第一個問題係佢話佢，但係佢嘅出發點唔係噉啊嘛，保護香港人。第二樣嘢，佢話佢唔係佢唔係打擊炒樓，點解唔打擊炒樓？炒樓就會打擊，但係佢話我只係唔想外國人嚟香港買樓嘅啫。咁依個問題。

572
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:34,850
係一個好嚴重嘅問題，一個經濟問題。好在佢唔係一個金融官員，而家係金融官員，佢係成個香港真係個經濟門閂咗㗎啦，香港死㗎啦，而家係噉。我係靠乜嘢？我係靠外來，任何國家都係靠外來外來嘅誒，即係收收入㗎。噉你先有個balance of payment嘅咁去做。另第三。

573
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:54,860
樣嘢，主席佢咧就去解釋，就話佢仲未答我關於嗰個誒誒呢個市區重建嗰啲，佢完全都唔去理解又唔去了解個情況，因為依啲情況咧係要係好嚴重嘅，依個係每一屆每一年嗰個嗰個推出嗰啲樓咧。

574
01:40:54,860 --> 01:41:14,870
佢重建有個又是私人做嘅咧，有一個好大嘅影響喺度。佢而家係阻住咗依方面嘅角度去進行嘅，主席。咁另外咧，我想咧就話，頭先咧去答啊啊啊啊薛薛滔嘅問題咧，有好多樓，因為我做市區重建，我知。

575
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:34,880
主席有好多樓咧係雙兩用嘅。佢嗰陣時一有時喺西環嗰方面咧，有好多樓咧冚唪唥咧就係用佢係要令到佢係出出就係依個係商商業嘅樓宇，但係可以畀人去住，準許去咗好多年，所以佢就而家令到依啲樓冚唪唥炒高曬佢。

576
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:43,860
噉啊，邊個得益咧？啊，士建國得益啦。當士冠嗰入嚟一收購嗰陣時咧，佢用商商業嘅實誒誒價嚟收你。

577
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:54,780
收你依個誒住宅嘅個個個物業，所以依啲冚唪唥咧，佢冚唪唥要諗清楚去咁做。我想去解解釋，Mr. Press個解釋點解？

578
01:41:55,330 --> 01:42:15,340
佢去有個有個分別歧視香港人用公司買樓，因為佢解決唔到個嗰個問題。咁解決唔到問題，你唔係關於香港人嘅問題啊嘛，係你自己無能啫嘛，主席。同埋咧，另外一樣嘢，我話畀你聽，佢用新加坡，新加坡係民選國家嚟㗎，佢哋唔中意嘅政府係可以選走㗎，但係我。

579
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:19,310
我哋唔係啊！我哋係喺基本法畀到我哋一個嚇。

580
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:26,840
一個一個一個冇選擇而係有一個有效度，但係如果噉嘅政府有效度咧，令到我哋好失望嘅，主席。

581
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:47,130
Mr. Duncan, thank you, Madam Chairman. Can I just seek a point of clarification? The, the my my point is very good, very simple. Hang on, let me clarify. Your your your logic, let me just seek a point of clarification. The word that I got in my translation here was protect Hong Kong people. Is that the word you?

582
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:47,710
used.

583
01:42:47,990 --> 01:43:08,000
I use your your your is to ensure that Hong Kong PR citizens let me can buy properties without interference from outsiders. My point is very simple. If a Hong Kong PR holder can use his name to buy property, why can't he has a choice to use a company to buy a company? Why?

584
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:28,010
你 discriminate the same PR holder in buying a property. What is your logic? Your logic is ensure that Hong Kong people can buy property at a price that he can be he can afford. And why you slam on the fifteen when he choose a company to buy? Please explain. Well, Mr. Tan, thank you for that.

585
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:29,140
澄清。

586
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:49,430
As I said before, the reason we've tried and we are still trying to look at ways to allow for companies to be exempted for this, but we have not been able to do so. We don't actually have a fundamental. But the CE promised us that when he finished baking, then he put it onto the market.

587
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:55,600
即係即係一一每一樣成熟，佢先至推出嚟啊嘛！你而家未成熟嘅推出嚟，主席。

588
01:43:55,950 --> 01:44:15,960
Oh, sorry. It is mature. It has been through the relevant process. the The issue here is so far, and despite a lot of effort to try to find ways to do this, we have not found a way that is possible, and that's the challenge. We brought forward what we think is the appropriate measures.

589
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:31,930
因為，having looked at all the suggestions from reader from other people, none of those are possible. Yes, you can't squeeze water out from the wood. The only thing you can squeeze out is your blood. If you have this type of limitation in thinking,

590
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:34,590
Can we expect of a government like that?

591
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:55,700
好嘅，上邊仲有冇補充？Just a couple of other things. Yeah, in fact, in our discussions with the honourable member previously, we we have explained and we will continue to explain that we do not want to interfere with the redevelopment process. But at the same time, again, we have.

592
01:44:55,700 --> 01:45:01,400
This challenge of having to ensure that redevelopment does actually take place, and that's the approach that we're taking.

593
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,780
重建嗰度有冇回應啊？石議員都問咗兩次。

594
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:14,760
有冇補充？As I said, we've tried to deal with it, and we think that the approach that we've taken to allow for

595
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,630
Developers to seek reimbursement is the appropriate way.

596
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:22,530
好，阿梁繼昌議員。

597
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:34,260
多謝主席。其實我係想講五分鐘，即係有幾樣嘢想講。第一就關於自由市場嘅問題，即係我覺得政府咧、啲官員咧，即係解釋就唔能夠一針見血，一個水平太低。

598
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:42,890
自由市場就係供同求，咁有同事就問就話啊，點解我哋唔管制外來人去買股票咧？

599
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:53,620
我想知道咧，就係你睇到股票個供求嘅供係一個elastic嘅，係好有彈性嘅供，即係你可以一年間多幾億股票喺喺個市場度。

600
01:45:53,900 --> 01:46:12,520
但係我哋嗰個物業市場咧，個供係inelastic嘅，你唔可以突然間一年咧多十萬間樓喺度。所以而家呢一個措施其實就係將嗰個交易成本，如果外國人買樓嘅交易成本（transaction cost）增高咗啫，就唔係話唔畀你買樓。

601
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:20,900
第二點用公司買樓嘅問題咧，我亦都好多意見嘅。其實我想講一講，睇下大家認唔認同。

602
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:32,390
咁點解即係有啲人用公司買樓咧？其實我都曾經追問過税務局長，甚至啊財經事務局長，點解我哋唔堵塞嘅流動？因為其實嗱。

603
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:45,810
用公司買住宅啊，講緊就未必一定係炒樓，但係咧其中一個目的咧，我都可以即係put一個as a proposal，就可能係一個避税嘅一個嘅一個嘅arrangement嚟嘅，即係有可能啦，當然。

604
01:46:46,200 --> 01:47:06,210
噉我食亦都問過財經事務局長，點解你誒誒喺做個特別印花税嘅時候嗱，嗰間誒，比如買咗之後誒，如果有一間公司喺半年之內嗰個股權係轉讓，而間公司咧唯一擁有物業係一個住宅樓宇嘅時候，點解你唔徵佢特別印花税啊？噉我得到嘅答覆就係話咧，用。

605
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:26,220
用公司買樓嘅誒誒宗數咧，可能買住宅樓宇係佔百分之十嘅啫，而用海外公司買嘅佔只只百分之一，所以咧佢就唔想堵塞呢個漏洞。咁而家好多朋友咧就喺度問：喂，點解我哋即係要限制香港人用公司買樓啊？嗱，兩個即係我可以諗到嘅嘅嘅解讀咧，就係話第一。

606
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:41,470
其實喺實際上嚟講咧，嗯，要查出一間公司嘅背後係邊個人擁有咧，係非常困難。如果我哋做到啊，阿陳茂波局長嘅海外控股公司嗰啲噉嘅股東啊董事一早披露咗出嚟啦，到而家。

607
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:47,550
啊！擾揚咗成四個月，都唔知佢背後係啲咩股東，甚至係啊董事。

608
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:48,650
嗱。

609
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:52,050
其實政府可能唔敢講呢樣嘢，因為咧。

610
01:47:52,690 --> 01:48:12,700
如果我哋就誒畀咗豁免啲公司咧，其實by symmetry嘅對稱嚟計咧，點解即係如果係咪要政府即係用一啲更加即係厲害嘅措施啊？要用一個see-through approach，如果公司淨係唯一用一個物業咧，或者資產就一間住宅樓嘅時候咧？

611
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:32,710
佢都要佢哋咧，係將呢個特別印花税咧嚟嚟嚟作呢個啊啊改動，就話咧，如果公司我哋唔係淨係睇間公司啊，睇下公司入邊啊擁有啲咩物業咧，其實用公司嚟買住宅物業咧，喺現有呢個制度底下咧，其實都已經係慳咗好多錢嘅，即係呢。

612
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:37,570
嘅個細好好好個微觀嘅一個誒嘅觀察。

613
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:52,110
所以喺個誒用唔用公司，畀唔畀公司，或者係誒公司買樓嘅時候，係咪成本高咗呢樣嘢咧？我覺得誒，我係誒唯一一次咧係贊成政府呢個噉嘅對策嘅嚇。多謝。

614
01:48:52,490 --> 01:49:12,500
好啊！誒，梁議員嘅意見。咁頭先係湯家華議員第一輪，佢曾經要求發言嘅。噉我因為時間關係啦，我畀埋湯家華議員發言咧。我哋就總結今日嘅會議，然後下一次我哋再跟進翻啲問題啦，好嘛？湯家華議員。多謝主席。我我我上邊有其他嘅會，所以對唔住，頭先真係需要上開會。誒，主要我哋兩個簡單問題啦。第一就當然係即係誒點。

615
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:32,510
點解即係香港人嘅公司買樓都要受到懲罰咧？噉我覺得邏輯上係有個問題喺度嘅。誒，剛才誒誒依個政府當局咧介紹嘅時候，佢就話有好多即係驚人哋逃税啊，或者係好難偵測。我覺得依啲都唔係一個即係令人信服嘅理由，因為點解咧？其實你需要。

616
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:52,520
杜絕誒濫用咧，其實好簡單嘅啫。你只需要喺個買家個定義嗰度咧，係講明，如果一個外國人無論係以個個人名義或者公司名義去買咧，都要畀税啦。咁已經好清楚㗎啦。假若佢誒係誒用公司名義去買樓而，

617
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,200
誒唔畀税咧，佢已經係犯咗刑事責任。

618
01:49:56,580 --> 01:50:16,590
咁所以頭先你講一大堆嘅理由話：哎呀，好多層公司，我點樣去查咧？其實都唔都唔需要考慮，因為所有嘅逃税嘅行為咧都係犯法嘅嚇。咁呢個本身咧已經係一個解決嘅方法。咁所以我希望聽聽即係政府點解會覺得呢個即係用一個噉嘅處理方法，即係用買家定義嘅方法。

619
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:36,600
就唔可以誒處理咗我哋頭先所講嘅問題。第二個問題，我想問咧，就係嗰個買賣嗰個定義誒，係咪都係跟翻誒特別印花税裏邊嘅定義咧？誒，譬如我諗到嘅係，譬如我誒誒長命契嚇咁誒，其中一個唔喺度啦，噉就畀咗個其。

620
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:53,910
其他嘅嘅親戚，而佢就唔係香港人嘅噉，咁會唔會就會觸犯咗依個誒特別引印花税咧，或者買家特別嘅買家印花税咧？如果嗰個買賣嗰個定義係跟翻誒以前嗰個特別印花税嗰個定義咧，咁可能個問題就唔係太大。

621
01:50:54,380 --> 01:51:14,390
兩條問題，邊位回答？阿陳，O.K.，阿王先生，我答第二條問題先啦。康議員問嗰個問題就係話係我哋個機制對唔住聽唔到第二條問題，我答咗第二條問題先啦。即係而家我哋個條例草案嗰個機制咧，某個程度係跟翻現行誒印花税條例裏邊嘅機制嘅，即係話如果一個。

622
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:34,400
交易裏邊牽涉個文件，呢個文件本身唔需要交基本上個我哋叫at volume duty咧，亦都唔需要交呢個買家印花税。咁正話你講一個長命契嗰種情況喺裏邊就唔需要交一個基本個印花税，所以亦都唔需要交呢個買家印花税嘅。但但係如果係gift咧？

623
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:40,680
譬如我一個decoration trust，即係一個信託，或者一個誒誒誒送贈。

624
01:51:40,960 --> 01:52:00,970
其實係冇利益誒交換嘅，噉係咪都會受到個買賣嗰個定義？因為你用而家目前嘅你頭先嗰個誒誒介紹就係買賣就用個assignment用嗰個誒嗰個屋契誒作為一個定義。其實呢個定義係可以包括冇金錢或者利益。

625
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:20,980
誒來往嘅嘅交易嘅係誒，議員嘅理解係正確嘅，即係喺一個亞三文可以係冇金錢交易嘅轉讓啊。咁而家喺誒呢個建議裏邊咧，亦都係用翻同一個機制，即係話如果係一個gift，如果係有一個香港永久性居。

626
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:31,080
居民去轉畀另外一個唔係香港嘅社會居民，先有機會有誒呢個買家印花税。民如果佢係送贈翻畀一個誒？

627
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:51,640
香港永久性居民就冇問題啦嘛，因為豁免㗎嘛。咁如果依個係由一個香港永久性居民轉讓畀另外一個非香港永久性居民，而依個非香港永久性居民唔係屬於裏邊而家個條例草案所講嘅配偶啊、誒父母啊、兄弟啊、子女依類所謂近。

628
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:56,380
親嘅人咧，噉樣就需要畀依個買家，即係就算係冇利益轉送咧。

629
01:52:56,970 --> 01:53:02,240
我中意送畀佢嘅，咁都要交呢個税喎？係嘛？係因為條例草案建議會要㗎。

630
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:10,400
第一部分咧，誒阿湯議員提嗰個方法，你哋有冇考慮過咧？

631
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:30,860
係啊，陳秘書長，我首先解一解咧，因應阿湯議員頭先所講咧，其實公司嘅股份嘅轉讓咧係好常見而家嘅例子。除咗股份嘅轉讓咧，其實另外一種我哋會誒要小心要處理，就係話一個個公司，縱使佢可能當中係本地人做一個嘅股東。

632
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:50,870
噉，但係如果佢哋透過發行一啲新嘅股，而個股份裏邊咧，佢個股份裏邊嘅一啲物業嘅誒成分咧，係可以從而咧轉讓到去一啲非本地人嘅話咧，咁呢一個其實已經咧係誒誒一個其中一個嘅好大嘅漏洞啦。我哋係無從咧去誒去跟進同埋。

633
01:53:50,870 --> 01:54:10,880
我相信你誤解咗我。我頭先嘅問題個問題就係你呢個呢個税咧，係徵收買家啊嘛。噉你只需要講話個買家唔可以，無論以個人身份或者係以股份或者公司嘅身份買買誒物業咧，佢都要交税嘅。咁已經係落涵括咗所有你頭先所講嘅問題。

634
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:30,890
如果佢係就算係用股份或者用公司去買物業，而佢唔去誒誒誒交呢個税咧，唔講畀你聽，佢已經係犯法，佢已經係逃税啦。咁所以你頭先所講嘅所有嘅困難咧，其實係並不存在嘅。有冇補充啊，陳先生？想都補充一樣咧，就係話咧。

635
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:50,900
其實你公司裏邊嘅股東咧，其實除咗一個誒本地居民，佢可能亦都當中咧有涉及啲非本地居民，而亦都有一啲嘅股東咧，可能係一個公司嘅一個實體嚟嘅。公司裏邊嘅股份會係點咧？亦都係會係可以好複雜。更加重要嘅咧，喺個法律嘅層面上邊咧，一個公司嘅實

636
01:54:50,900 --> 01:55:10,910
你你唔明我講乜嘢對唔？阿湯議員，不如畀阿秘書長再答。唔係佢佢佢急啲係唔係？我明白，唔緊要。哎呀，頭阿陳。喺個法律個層面上邊咧，公司呢一個實體咧，其實同佢嗰個股東大家之間嗰個責任咧，其實係一個分隔㗎。個公司就係一個實體，咁所以我哋從來去睇翻個公司嘅。

637
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:30,920
嘅時候咧，就係會睇佢個個係本地註冊嘅公司，定係一啲非本地註冊嘅公司。如果頭先阿湯議員所講到啦，個公司咧佢係一個港人係股東嘅，咁但係呢一個嘅股東，我哋點樣去去追查佢？其實另外會唔會有其他嘅股東係非港人嘅話咧？呢一個我哋係無從。

638
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:50,930
噉樣去去一路追尋落去，更遑論咧，佢有一啲股東其實會係一個另外一個公司嚟嘅，佢公司裏邊嘅股份咧，亦都可以係涉及一啲唔同嘅層次上去。咁所以咧，如果我哋去喺呢一度畀任何嘅豁免嘅話咧，就會喺公司呢一個實體之中咧，去作出一啲不同處理嘅方法。咁呢一

639
01:55:50,930 --> 01:56:10,940
個喺個法律個基礎上邊咧，係會帶嚟好唔緊要啦，湯議員呢個問題，我相信我哋仲會跟進。唔係因為時間關係，我必須要喺度講咧，我就請容許我誒現場個會議少少處理埋最後呢段誒嘅安排，好冇？下一次再跟進啦，因為呢個問題咧，我相信你嘅團體咧，講咩主席，可能我表達得唔係幾好啦。唔緊要，下一次仲有。

640
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:30,950
有充足嘅時間畀你再去表達嚇嗱。誒頭先咧都有議員要求當局提交進一步嘅資料文件，咁包括係一啲外國嘅例子，係處理啊誒或者有類似誒買家印花税嘅外國例子嘅資料。咁另外就係謝偉全議員，係咪你有啲比較啊技術嘅問題？你可唔可以喺度重複定係？

641
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:34,220
你係邊幾部分嘅技術問題？需要官員再去進一步回答。

642
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:51,980
誒主席，不如我誒書面寫畀你。好啊，好啊，O K。噉就誒希望下次大家啊，政府當局就提交文件，讓大家再討論啦。至於頭先常任秘書長都話，其實都係聽到誒。

643
01:56:52,260 --> 01:57:12,270
市民以至到議員咧，對於公司香港人公司不能啊誒，需要畀買家印花税呢個關注。噉我相信嚟緊嘅團體咧，都會有好多係就住呢點會表達意見。噉啊，聽完之後，政府當局都要進一步回應。咁相信大家唔使太心急嘅，就住呢一點。噉我哋今日嘅會議，因為時間，

644
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:18,460
已經過咗啦，就去到呢度。噉我哋咧就誒，下次嘅開會時間，上一次已經定咗㗎啦。

645
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:23,190
誒就係二二月四號下晝兩點半至四點半。

646
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:27,570
係啦，噉我哋冇其他事項嘅話咧，今日會議去到呢度結束啦。唔該曬。
