1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,210
Kevin。

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,240
阿坡啊，對唔住，阿坡第一輪嚇，唔係唔好意思嚇。

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,560
我睇唔到你啊！啊，配合。

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,630
多謝主席。之前我誒都。

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:27,320
重複翻剛才都幾位同事都講過咧，就其實嗰個誒房嘅資源係咁珍貴，特別而家嘅輪候情況咁嚴峻嘅時候咧，其實我哋係應該盡量係唔同嘅方法咧，將嗰個輪候嘅。

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:47,630
嗰嗰個所謂嘅誒數字咧，係盡量係去到一個誒冇太多水位，甚至乎係應該係一個真真正正反映實況嘅一個情況啦。咁呢方面咧，我想問幾個問題啊，主席。係第一咧，我想問問咧，就喺睇翻誒第四點四段咧，有關於申請人咧喺申請嘅階段咧，雖然咧表面上咧就

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:01:05,600
話要提供一係列嘅文件或者一啲嘅證明咧，但係事實上咧就有關佢哋嘅投資同埋存款咧喺實際上執行上咧係喺呢個階段係唔需要提供嘅。咁呢個咧，剛才咧就阿黃小姐、黃女士講過就話，因為要所謂嘅streamline即係採取一個平衡咧，就可以係一個誒。

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,890
手續上可以快捷啲，但係呢個我想聽多少少咧喺。

9
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:25,140
實際上，如果我哋能夠可以將個排名係減少嘅情況下，或者將啲唔合適嘅申請個人咧，已經一早已經可以所謂follow出去嘅話咧，咁呢個做法咧，點解你哋唔可以喺早啲嘅時候都真係做check多啲嘢咧？

10
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:45,430
黃女士係多謝主席。誒，我諗其實頭先我都嘗試去解釋啦，就係真係要取一個平衡嘅。我哋check多啲嘢，其實個程序時間一定係要即係相對一定要長啲嘅。咁即使我哋而家唔同佢去check，但係其實我哋要有一個申報嘅機制嘅，即係話咧，佢個申請者要申報佢自己嗰個。

11
00:01:45,430 --> 00:02:05,440
誒誒嗰個資產咧，其實係符合我哋嗰個誒條件嘅。亦都頭先都講過，我亦都有一啲抽查嘅程序。如果我哋事後發現到佢原來係即係刻意咁虛報一啲資料咧，我哋都會做一個檢控。咁同埋最緊要就係話，我哋唔係話唔check，只不過咧，我哋將嗰個焦點係放喺佢臨近配屋嗰一。

12
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:25,450
黑嗰個審查階段先至check，咁變咗係無論從資源分配同埋唔會令到嗰個申請人，如果一啲係一啲唔係有心虛假虛報資料嘅申請人啦，亦都唔會太過滋擾佢，令佢覺得太過繁複。同埋另外一點，我都想提出咧，就係有陣時資產嗰啲，譬如頭先所講，譬如股票又好、基金又好，嗰啲我哋都算係資產嘅，咁亦。

13
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:45,460
都會有一啲變化嘅，咁所以其實你太早去check佢咧，可能你check完到臨尾配屋之前嗰個審查嗰個程序，其實你都要再check嘅，即係變咗時間上咧，其實係要咗有少少重複嘅嘢。噉我哋就希望喺嗰個誒成個過程嘅流暢啦，從嗰個申請人個角度去考慮啦，同埋咧就我哋資源。

14
00:02:45,460 --> 00:03:05,470
方面咧就希望攞到個平衡，所以有今天呢一個噉樣嘅機制嚇。多謝主席。好似誒，好似答咗個問題，但係事實上答嘅答案咧係製造更多問題出嚟。我哋成日講喺醫療咧就預防勝於治療，就唔想希望去到真係去到病去到醫嗰下咧先至去做工作投資落去。所以我哋連煙都要搞咁多咁重。

15
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:25,480
税落去，你哋而家咧就話將所有嘅資源，由於咧你話遲早都要check㗎啦，去到配屋嗰陣時都要check㗎啦，都要交嘢㗎啦。於是，我哋就有個個表咧，一路唔理佢住。而家問題就正正問你點解，淨係要求申請人提供一啲嘅佢哋嘅投資嘅文件證據？我唔係話要好精準咁攞足曬當天嘅數字，但係如果佢有好明顯有啲。

16
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,650
資產根本係。

17
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:46,940
即係拉大攬都拉唔上，申請到嘅噉，你點解唔早啲提供攞啲文件，要交出嚟等佢？大家都知道，唔使等落去咧。係係誒，我諗喺嗰個申請嗰度咧，其實我哋要求佢咧係要自己要申報，究竟佢合唔合我哋嘅資格先？因為我哋除咗入息之外咧，嗰個資產都有一個即係個要求嘅，有限制嘅。

18
00:03:46,940 --> 00:04:06,950
咁呢個個責任亦都首先第一個責任一定係申請人身上啦。噉我哋話提供嗰個文件方面咧，我頭先都嘗試去解釋咧，就係話我去到臨編配嗰陣，我哋真係去check佢嘅，所以唔係話一個冇check嗰個機制，咁而話預防嗰度咧，我哋都係靠嗰個信息，就係話咧，我哋其實會抽查嘅，咁所以就唔。

19
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:23,570
冇即係刻意去虛報啲嘅資料，因為虛報資料咧，亦都有個後果，我哋會檢控佢嘅嚇。噉就希望係呢方面可以平衡到。或者我哋抽查嗰啲，我會講到啦。轉頭嚇，但問題就正正就係一個申請者可能要等隨時都三五年、七年、十年。

20
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:43,860
誒資源係咁貴嘅，噉你哋用多少時間交繳，甚至係交多少少關於佢個資產嘅文件，有乜咁大問題啊？點解你唔肯做呢樣嘢咧？啊，黃女士，係誒，我我諗我哋唔係話唔肯做，即係只不過咧就係從個資源分配裏面，即係我哋覺得呢個可能係比較有效率嘅一個做法，因

21
00:04:43,860 --> 00:05:03,870
因為我哋其實自己嗰個誒申請咗同事嘅人手，的確都有限嘅。咁所以，我哋希望咧，無論喺申請嗰一刻，喺編配嗰一刻，個資源嗰個調撥個優次係邊一方面，我哋覺得係比較着重啲咧。咁當然啦，我哋今天係側重咗喺嗰個配屋之前嗰個檢查啦。咁但係，如果你話資源係許可的話，咁

22
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:23,880
有冇得考慮咧？咁呢個我哋唔會話完全話，即係完全冇考慮。不過今天以嗰個資源嘅分配嚟講，我哋覺得呢個係可能係一個，即係我哋覺得係合適嘅做法啫嚇。多謝主席。Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, I think I need to add a couple of points here. First, as Agnes has said, it is about our resources and our ability to to collect this information, vet it.

23
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:43,890
Check it, and the key point here is checking, because even if you submit a document, it has to be checked. It's much more efficient to check that document at the point when they're about to be considered for allocation. It just there's no point in doing it on a repeated basis. Having said that, of course, I think it is something that we should look at as we refine.

24
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:54,420
and look at the way we operate our our application system. So we'll bear that in mind the next time we do a review. But I think it is about efficiency, and this is efficiency.

25
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:14,770
誒，當然明白咧。到真係配屋嘅時候有需要咧，甚至喺嗰個再接見當事人嘅階段咧，都可能要重新check一次最update嘅情況、最近嘅情況。但問題就係你哋連交都唔使交出嚟啊嘛。喺實際上申請嗰陣時，好似佢講咗就算噉。你哋連最起碼嘅户口嗰單啊，或者一般嚟講申請呢啲噉嘅誒。

26
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:34,780
誒誒申請者咧，佢哋都可能唔會太多太複雜，或者所謂太過誒誒誒撩楞嘅投資嘅計劃，啲你哋好難check嘅。基本上可能啲銀行嘅存摺啊，誒最新嘅銀行有一個一個一個月結單啊，已經可以睇到好多嘢嘅啦。咁點解連你交都唔使交出嚟咧？誒。

27
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:54,790
Mr. Chan， we we're happy to look at that. As I say, at the moment it's it's it's not required, but we'll we'll have a look at it.係。好似另外咧，睇翻報告咧，就我諗呢個大家都同意嘅，就係話，如果喺早嘅階段check咧，你哋嗰個check到有一個成功嘅數字咧，就係遠遠咧係誒勝於咧。

28
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,910
對唔住，我應咁講嚇，誒喺喺嗰個誒。

29
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,160
睇翻嗰個，你哋嗰個誒？

30
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:13,200
關於誒失實嘅聲明嗰度咧，如果喺早期check咧，你哋個detection rate咧就係三十五個percent。

31
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:34,010
誒，我有冇記？我冇講錯。如果係去到後期咧，出到出有出事嘅，去到二點一嘅percent，意思即係話咧，早期嘅誒有失實嘅嗰個數字係遠遠係，或者嗰個情況係遠遠嚴重過咧，去到最後階段分樓嗰陣時候咧，先至係去發現出嚟嘅。咁如果早啲check嘅話咧，其實咪應該可以更加。

32
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:54,020
早將你哋嗰個輪候嘅嗰個名冊更加反映個現個實況，亦都將我哋嘅政策咧，無論分配邊種屋邊嘅家庭咧，亦都可以更加清楚，而更加唔需要咧係keep住一啲file喺度咧。你成日邊度都邊度你揾啦，你手頭上咁多file，一早啲唔可以清除咗啲檔案咧，等你可以根本將成。

33
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,460
件事咧係係所謂真係可以誒streamline咗佢咧。

34
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:13,170
嗯，先生，我我係咪？我係咪？係我誒，審計處可以幫幫我啦。但係我睇翻嗰個係一個一個誒。

35
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,660
證據。

36
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:33,870
多謝廿四毫廿九啊，四點九。Four table二十九，四點九。Paragraph嗰度多謝。Table twenty nine。Yeah, I mean, what this, if if I'm reading it correctly, it shows us is that the number of false detection cases detected in each of the individual years.

37
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:42,840
And then the number of cancellations. I'm not sure that the figures follow your narrative. That's my problem. Can I just say that?

38
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,180
the the figures of false declarations will depend on a number of different factors.

39
00:08:50,470 --> 00:09:10,480
What we try to do is to make sure that when we do investigate cases, that we we do not only just check on their original declaration, but we check on the actual data that they produce. And that's when, as I say, it usually comes at the latter point, the point at which we're we're considering them for formal application. But I'm not sure that I understand the narrative.

40
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:28,740
或者我嘗試再誒從你分析下咧，因為依度個表格就講咧，就話如喺嗰個誒所謂false declaration detected咧，我睇緊英文版本咧，就係誒喺嗰個誒比例上咧，係如果係話誒。

41
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:50,270
早期check嘅咧，佢哋發覺到有問題嘅數字咧，係係係遠遠係有效過係去到最後嗰期，或者係嗰個有關。當然呢個亦都係實況，因為當時去到最後階段嘅時候咧，可能好多嘢已經係西咗出嚟，好多嘢清楚知道。咁問題就係，如果你越早期能夠越早擺多啲資源落去check嘅話，你可以預早西咗出嚟好多個案咧。

42
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:58,000
你係唔需要嘥咁多資源，擺咁多檔喺枱面度，一路一路每一年都飄落去，每一年嘅list越嚟越長，搞到自己嚇自己啊嘛～

43
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,500
Mr. Chairman, we could certainly look at that. However, I would point out that.

44
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:14,790
If we deploy resources at the earlier stage, they'll come from our investigations at the later stage because we have a finite number of resources, and the fact that someone is screened out at an early stage.

45
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:26,260
doesn't necessarily mean they won't dispose of those resources and come back at a later stage. So even though there are screening out, even though there are false declarations identified, frankly, the the real

46
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:46,570
impact is at the point when they're going to be allocated their unit. That's where the priority should be. But I'm happy to look at this alternative。係當然，主席，我當然我唔係話喺分樓嗰個階段咧，你唔會check或者嗰陣係冇咗有效嘅checking。但係而家最主要就係話咧，而家大家都覺得咧，你哋嗰個輪候冊裏邊啊水位就係太多，無論係。

47
00:10:46,570 --> 00:11:06,580
喺嗰個QPS嗰個制度又好，或者喺誒，由於你哋冇去真係早早期工作咧，又或者你哋checking個時間太長嘅原因，講係三個月嘅，變咗而家超過六個月都做唔到一個個案噉嘅情況之下，令到你成個輪候策咧，畀人感覺咧就係自己嚇自己都好緊要噉啊！如果你早啲做，早啲將一啲唔適合嘅個案，甚至。

48
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:26,590
係有心係隱瞞嘅個案咧，早啲篩出嚟，甚至早啲執執一個執法嘅行動嘅話咧，即使佢將來真係再有資格申請到咧，好多人已經係由於佢試過呢個經驗咧，佢唔敢再試，又或者已經係受到法律上嘅制裁，佢唔應該再試。咁呢啲咧係可以令到成個後策咧可以係更加精準、精準。

49
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:39,050
呢個就係個point，director housing。I don't I don't dispute that， and as I said， we're quite happy to look at。You you're prepared to look into it， so we put that into the report。Please do， thank you。

50
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:54,770
阿波，至於另一個就係啦，剛才有同事批評過啦，話你哋一年做三百個checking嘅個案咧，實在太少啦，比起個申請嘅數字。而咧就誒當中咧理論上咧一即係一百二十個咧係早期嘅，一百八十個就去到真係分配樓嘅先做啊。

51
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:09,300
咁喺個基礎咁講咧，如果又係啦，如果你將嗰個比例，即使你個資源上唔能夠再多啲都好啦，係擺多啲喺翻早期嗰度，又會唔會又改善咗你哋嗰個效率，或者改善咗輪候拆嗰個情況咧？

52
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:29,810
director post係都係主席，係誒。我我諗其實可能講緊有少少兩樣嘢嘅，即係我同意頭先啊啊鄭議員所講咧，就係話有一個阻嚇作用咧。我早啲抽查噉就希望咧喺將來咧就呢啲水分會比較少啲啦。咁但係可能我哋都要留意咧，實際運作上面咧就係話，如果佢一開始一交嗰個新。

53
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:49,820
表即係初期嗰下咧，我哋已經要用多啲時間去核對曬所有嘢咧。其實咧，嗰個核對個時間一定長咗嘅。咁所以如果我哋講翻話喺嗰個誒申請人個觀感上，佢一定會覺得自己又等得耐咗㗎啦。即即變咗係，如果我用翻有限嘅資源去噉樣去分配個情況，除非我可以再有多啲嘅。

54
00:12:49,820 --> 00:13:02,820
資源咧喺早期嗰陣咧，去抽調多啲人手去做，咁但係我哋呢個係會考慮，不過即係我想提翻出嗰個現實可能會係一個噉嘅情況。個個現實你自己呃你自己啫嘛，因為。

55
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:23,530
Director of Audit都係咁講，你如果人哋交紙畀你，你又要去現要要去要要registration嗰陣時去，噉你嗰件事嘅時間，但係佢交畀你嗰陣時就可以做噉啊！阿謝議員就係咁解。正正就係講緊預防勝於治療。我哋呢排好興講咧頭門、中門、尾門啦，而家就係你守頭門啊嘛。你頭門守得好嘅話，你就噉。

56
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,720
根本唔使中門，唔使尾門，亦都唔使表面上好多嘢打到曬尾門先手啊嘛。

57
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:49,010
如果你如果你係加翻前嗰個A W T嗰度咧，即係停候時間嗰陣時咧，佢交紙畀你，你接受佢紙嘅誒，應該開始嗰陣時計。係我明白嚇。啊，O K好。之前我哋輪到講講嗰個所謂Q P S個system，即係嗰個誒配額制嗰度。咁嗰度咧，大家都知道咧，而家咧喺三十歲以下嘅。

58
00:13:49,010 --> 00:14:09,020
嘅申請者咧根本係無望嘅，每一年咧佢哋嘅成功都係零嘅啊。咁呢一方面咧，一方面啲申請者咧就以為咧十八歲開始就唔好走雞啦，馬上申請先。但係事實上咧擺落去都得個即係假象嚟，即係除非佢十二年內咧都唔會任何喺喺喺職業上啊，喺誒喺嗰個社會上嘅進展係真係噉。

59
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:22,680
不濟啦，否則嘅話咧，理論上咧，佢哋應該十有十二年時間，應該係跳出嗰個應該資格嘅。咁但係呢個點解你哋又要噉樣做？咁不如點解唔可以將嗰個申請年齡啊，索性老實啲，三十歲開始先接受申請得唔得咧？

60
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:39,370
Director of Housing, Mr. Chairman, no, I'm afraid we can't because there will be some people who are genuinely need of housing who are not graduates, who are not students, who have issues. We need to be able to pick them up. So I'm not about to arbitrarily put a 30 or 35.

61
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:59,660
Our system is already very, I think, draconian in that sense that people do have to wait a long time. It's it's their choice. What we will do, and we've already agreed to do this as a consequence of the long-term housing strategy, we'll look at how we can rationalise the list so that people are not staying on the list who should not be on the list. But frankly, I think there are

62
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:19,670
有啲人咧，就係因為佢哋嘅年齡咧，係比較大嘅，噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。噉佢哋嘅年齡咧，就係比較大嘅。咁

63
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:39,680
Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't believe that's correct because, you know, whether it's a quota and point system or a young family just starting out in life at age 18, 19 or 20, I think they should be able to apply. Whether or not they get through will be subject to all of the conditions. You are both are talking as if half half a glass of water.

64
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,910
半滿或半滿，all depends what this is what they say.

65
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,180
It's difficult.

66
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,000
Paul。

67
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,490
之前我睇先睇個誒。

68
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,360
paper狗嗰度。

69
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:18,630
如果冇咧，我畀第畀Candice你排翻隊響麥坡。好啊，好啊，轉一轉先對Candice。係多謝主席嗱。其實我都跟進翻求生社委員講嗰個Q.P.S.嗰個制度啦。嗱，其實你睇到啊審計處長喺第二點三五段第二十頁嗰度咧，二點三五段就列出咧，就話咧。

70
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:38,770
三十五歲以下嘅申請者咧，有卅四個percent咧喺申請公屋時為學生，即係可能係大學生又得讀緊，就有啲甚至可能讀緊呢個嚇研究院課程嘅。有四十七個percent咧具專上或更高學歷，三十三個percent為公屋住客。然而在三十五歲以上申請人當中只有。

71
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,280
七個percent達啊，專上或更高學歷。

72
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:52,310
亦都睇一睇咧，喺表七嗰度睇到咧，我哋睇到其實喺三十歲以下嘅申請者咧，係佔咗五啊七個percent。

73
00:16:52,590 --> 00:17:11,730
啊，五啊七個percent好多啊，其實即係話咧，你我哋成日同事之間舊病房屋住啊，房委會做得唔夠就話點解我哋嘅申請嗰個輪候冊度有廿幾萬人嘅？咁呢啲亦都係頭先有啲月誒同事講咗，你哋係咪自己嚇自己咧？噉你都再睇睇表九啊，喺廿三頁嗰度表九。

74
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:33,250
五年內根據配額及計分制獲得安置嘅人士咧，三十歲以下咧係零嘅，係冇機會，絕無機會，係冇冇喺呢個QPS分配過任何單位嘅嗱。當然咧，即係頭先啊，處長講嘅就話咧，我哋唔可以剔除。

75
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:53,260
十八歲以下嘅啊人士去申請個公屋，亦都有可能有個別好特別嘅例子，可能係噉嘅需要。但喺計分制度上咧，我覺得咧，你哋必須要全盤考慮，究竟我哋係咪誒仍然係用翻十八歲比分佢哋咧，抑或根本其實？

76
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:13,270
好多人個心態就哇有著數啊，就排咗隊先啦。咁呢樣嘢其實係咧，係浪費咗好多資源。你哋去就算去攞誒，即係去接受啲申請等等咧，係有五萬，即係成五萬五千個申請表嘅，每年要要接受呢一啲QPS入邊，你有冇考慮過從？

77
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:23,810
嗰個計分制，嗰個完全盤考慮係令到真係有需要嘅，就算講緊十八歲嘅申請者先正去申請咧，主席啊！

78
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:44,120
Director of Housing, Mr. Chairman, as I say, I think you're absolutely right. It's it's a perspective thing. I mean, I could argue that if it's only 34% of students applying under the at the age of 18, then it means that 76% are not students. You know, the the problem here is that we have a system that allows people to apply.

79
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:52,480
因為他們可能有enuine housing needs。what we need to do and what we've accepted and agree with the honourable member is that we need to look at the list and

80
00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:12,770
基本上，take out those people who will never never be eligible. And clearly, then we can look at perhaps setting a thirty or thirty five as an appropriate age which we would look at this. But I think, as I say, I don't think it's appropriate for us to apply an arbitrary cut off above that, because then we'd have to have special arrangements for special applications. It become

81
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,310
more difficult. In terms of the

82
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:37,600
the criteria we might apply, we haven't quite got there yet. But we'll we'll bear in mind members' comments. We're also waiting to hear what comments come back from the public as as part of the long-term housing strategy review exercise. As director of housing, the two members just ask questions relating to 18, which and the point system they can apply.

83
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,270
And if you look into the table nine.

84
00:19:40,550 --> 00:20:00,560
But your argument itself is not holding, because none of the H that the two members that suggested actually being allocated for housing. So what they're saying that you should is not that you don't receive special cases under 18 or and over or under 30.

85
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:20,570
But you are actually creating unnecessary hassles and wasting of resources to process those applicants that automatically at eighteen day apply. These are the points that the two members are actually pointing out. And if you look at table now, which actually reflected.

86
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:40,580
The whole situation. Do you understand their questions? I fully understand, and that. But I, I repeat my point. I don't think we would want to exclude eighteen. We think it's better to take the thirty cut-off as the criterion on which we will rationalise the list. It's a slightly different approach. There's no difference in perception of the situation. We're just saying that we don't want

87
00:20:40,580 --> 00:21:00,590
Mr. Chairman, I just want to continue to drill on this point because we are not talking about excluding people above 18 to apply. But when Mr. Prescott told me that in 2.35a that 34% of

88
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:20,600
The applicant when when they did the application were students. That means sixty-seven per cent of those when they did the application were not students. But however, I I need to point out that A, B and C are not mutually exclusive because out of the sixty-seven per cent, some may fall.

89
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:40,610
within this forty seven percent, which means they may have higher qualifications, or when they are doing the application, they are already living in a public rented housing. This is not not the the argument I I would like to accept. But but the fact is, I think when

90
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:54,650
你 know designing the point system, you should give this incentive to people who are more eligible or who who have the potential to move up the social strata.

91
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:15,110
maybe you you can you know design a point system that that that that is not you know positive points maybe you are trying to just encourage people possessing you know university degrees or already living in in housing estates or people.

92
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,090
who are between the age of 18 and 24 to to to not.

93
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:32,900
applying so early. I mean, you should try not to build in an incentive system to encourage everyone, every Hong Kong citizens who has reached the age of 18 to apply for public housing, because that is not

94
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:53,190
The crust of the design of our housing system, director of housing. Please, I must stress the point. We are not questioning the policy, but we are looking at from a value from money audit point of view. You are wasting resources in processing unnecessary applications. We should not have been there because of the incentive you give under your.

95
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:13,200
Present system, so please understand that this is where we are directing. We are not questioning your policy. That will be the housing panel. But because we are looking from a value for money audit, can you understand that? Yeah, of course. Okay, Mr. Chairman. In fact, the honourable member is quite right. People who are public housing tenants lose points.

96
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:33,210
We actually take points off them, because exactly for that reason we don't want to have to encourage people. What we haven't yet got, and as I said, this is something we are definitely going to be looking at as a consequence of the recommendations arising from both the audit report and the LTHS, is should we have similar penalties applied to

97
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,300
其他 criterian that exist in the list. Now the only other two criterian must be, of course, age.

98
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Clearly, PRH is already a penalty, and is is there something else? Now it could be education.

99
00:23:47,580 --> 00:24:07,590
Should we apply a penalty to education? So I'm not disagreeing with you at all. In fact, I'm agreeing with you to say yes. This is exactly what we need to look at. It is something that we will be doing. We've had some initial thoughts about it, but at the moment I have to stick to the line of eighteen as the application year. Then how do we deal with the other part? So I don't think there's any.

100
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:14,650
Okay, Kenneth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The the other thing you you probably should consider would be that if these

101
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,780
年輕 applicant are living with their parents or the family. I mean that that should know.

102
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:40,070
warrant the points deducted because it doesn't matter whether they're living in in public rental housing if they are already having a decent accommodation and that is something you need to consider. But with your agreement, Mr. Chairman, I do nothing. I have any question on Chapter Two, but I don't know whether the other members would have question on Chapter Two. With your permission, I can can I.

103
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:51,230
我哋移步到章三。Yes，聽問問先好嘛。Can I just answer that last point, please, on this chapter two? I accept that we can look at different criteria. However,

104
00:24:51,770 --> 00:25:10,370
just living with someone doesn't necessarily mean that the conditions they're living in is acceptable, and the problem is you then have to look at the conditions, you have to do a lot more drilling down into the circumstances. That's why we've applied the PRH as acceptable housing. That's the standard. So I'm not sure we'd be able to follow that last suggestion.

105
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,230
OK，啊，各位啊啊。

106
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,550
啊！主打。

107
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,620
局長。

108
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:29,070
就就問你哋嗰啲跟住啲問題係咪係問issue two？如果係咧，我就畀大家問完先跳落第三個話。我哋係問尊重係好嘛？OK，噉啊，跟住咧就係Alan。

109
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:43,220
啊，多謝主席。主席嗱，即係我覺得噉樣啦。雖然啊啊處長咧，就我記得起碼講過兩次，就話咧審計報告咧係。

110
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:56,150
確認咗呢個所謂平均輪候時間少於三年咧，係冇錯嘅。噉係噉，但係咧個最主要嘅關鍵咧，就係你如果從

111
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:03,710
政府角度睇，要起幾多公屋？幾時起好？咁嗰個。

112
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,200
嗰個誒指標作用係重要㗎嘛？

113
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,650
噉，但係更加緊要嘅咧，就係從嗰啲等緊上樓嗰啲街坊嘅角度咧。

114
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:20,880
噉你話畀佢聽三年，噉佢又唔會聽得咁明嘅，原來咁複雜嘅。

115
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,260
收到藍卡司計嘅。

116
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:30,400
跟住咧，就第一次畀樓你揀，就停個鐘㗎啦噉。

117
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:38,800
咁咧，你一下就解釋多啲畀人聽啦。但係你講，你解釋多啲畀人聽咧，可能嗰啲街坊咧就會找你晦氣嘅。

118
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,320
嗱，咁所以個問題就係咧，你始終咧呢個所謂。

119
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:58,950
實後時間係超過三年咧，亦都係不爭嘅事實。而喺街坊嘅角度咧，實際等候幾多年先至上到樓咧，先係最關鍵啊嘛。佢而家唔係同你玩統計數字遊戲啊嘛。

120
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,180
嗱，咁主席，我就想即係喺呢方面再跟一跟咧，就係噉啊。

121
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,380
嗱。

122
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:24,670
如果照統計處啊，照呢個審計處長嘅報告嘅表二咧睇到咧，即係由入紙去到出藍卡咧，即係所謂登記咧，就出藍卡咧，大概兩個半月嘅，係咪？嗯，即係阿阿處長可以睇下表二咧，表二咧就好清楚。

123
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,270
好啦。

124
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,730
咁如果睇個圖圖三咧？

125
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,870
就更加清晰㗎啦！

126
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,970
即係你嗰個所謂實後時間咧。

127
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,670
即係佢係由申請。

128
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:44,850
嗰嗰日起計到到登記即係出藍卡咧，就零點二一年啊嘛，主席。咁即係嗰個大概係兩個半月。

129
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,060
好啦，咁去到首次配屋。

130
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,720
到到實際上樓咧，就睇表錄咯喎！

131
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,480
噉啊，睇表六咧。

132
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,820
你又見到嗰度咧？原來咧。

133
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,680
就喺第十七頁啊，主席。嗯，你睇嗰度啊。

134
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:24,870
嗰度咧有一個一個個案咧，等咗十年以上嘅，即係佢佢第一次嗱，你睇嗰個表六就講輪候策上已獲首次配屋，但係未獲安置啊嘛嘅一般申請人啊嘛，即係畀咗第一次配屋嘅機會佢啦。咁但係等咗十年有一個噉就呢個當然係好特別啦嚇。

135
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:44,880
但係，如果你睇一年以下嘅六千二百四十二，就算我攞呢個嚟嚟計啊，你嗰度都加多一年落去啦，起碼即實際上到樓喎。係噉，即係前邊出藍卡又等兩個半月，後邊又等平均都等即係一。

136
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,720
哇！年紀啦，我諗我噉樣粗略咁睇啦。

137
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:09,010
咁所以你其實實際上樓嘅時間咧，你如果睇翻圖三咧，主席，嗯，你就見到㗎啦。即係如果你佢第三次配屋先得嘅咧，就等四點一二年嘅嗱。好啦，咁呢個就有問題。首先立此存照，以正視聽先啦。因為如果你睇表三嗰度咧，你就

138
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,780
好清楚㗎啦，即係實際等候時間咧，係有百分之二十九啊！

139
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,420
就係即係三年以上㗎啦。

140
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:38,230
嗯，噉就即係話十個等緊喺輪候冊等緊嘅人咧，唔係計嗰啲非長者添喎，係一般嗰啲咧，十個有三個咧係要等三年以上嘅，就實際情況啦。係，咁所以咧，即係呢個問題係嚴重嘅，咁令到嗰啲街坊咧真係有啲怨。

141
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:58,240
言啦，因為佢話房屋署長咁有信用講話三年，實際我咧十個裏邊有三個咧係要要等到三年以上嘅。好啦，噉你點樣先至可以即係令到呢啲等緊上樓嘅街坊係比較即係安樂啲咧？咁？

142
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,010
嗱，我就想頭先我問咗，但係咧就啊啊。

143
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,130
秘書長同啊處長咧都未認真答我啫，二點二七段嗰度咧。

144
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:18,050
因為處長咧就就話阿黃女士都講啦，佢話嗱，你睇呢個我哋十月三十一號咪十月啦，總之。

145
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:35,870
誒今年十月交畀房屋事務委員會嗰個文件，即係喺我哋Jan Two嗰度啦。咁但係嗰度咧，其實冇交代到二點二七段所講嗰個六成咧係點樣嘅喎。嗯，真係冇嘅喎。咁所以呢度咧，我始終覺得咧，佢哋係要答一答，即係究竟呢啲係咪？

146
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:56,160
係咪又係即係行會討論過變成機密啊？亦或係乜嘢理由啊？即係而家係係，因為我睇嗰個附件二咧喺嗰個Jan Two咧係睇唔到嘅。嗱，點解呢個重要咧？主席，因為咧，如果啲街坊咧係知道，譬如有一啲乜嘢特殊嘅個案係會等要係超過。

147
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:14,640
嗰個誒正常輪候時間嘅，即係你就算你講平均輪候時間三年好，實際輪候時間四年半好啦。噉佢哋知道，如果我係唔屬於呢啲個案嘅，噉我就可以有一個把握三年上到樓啦。咁

148
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,220
咁所以呢個係重要嘅，所以我就想一間都問一問佢哋，即係嗰個會唔會做啦？

149
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,150
或者答翻呢個先啦。

150
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:30,720
即係真係會唔會做？因為睇嗰個十月嗰個交嚟本會同委員會嗰個文件係睇唔到答案㗎嘛。

151
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:51,560
Director，Director潘Sir。阿王女士。好，誒或者講翻即係我哋係十月交畀房屋事務委員會，其實就係十一月四號嗰個會議度討論咗啦。其實我哋話咧，誒如果用翻最新嗰個分析咧，即係二零一三年六月底嗰個情況咧，噉我哋都睇翻咧當時喺五年或者。

152
00:31:51,560 --> 00:32:11,570
以上都仲未有首次編配咧，大概有二千一百宗度。咁點解我哋話誒，我哋係特登就住呢二千一百宗咧去做一啲分析嘅，所以我哋特登用人手翻查翻佢每一個誒個案究竟咩理由咧。咁所以我哋先講出誒喺文件裡面所講嘅，就係話當中涉及嘅頭先我哋提。

153
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:31,580
及嗰個理由啦，或者佢更改咗佢資料啦，或者佢拒絕誒接受所編配嘅單位啦，或者咧就係一啲誒取消咗個時段啦，各種嘅理由。噉我哋係就住呢個咧係人手翻查去嘗試揾出嗰個原因嘅。咁至於話其餘嗰啲有啲係啲咩原因咧？其實我哋頭先都有講過㗎啦，就係話可能佢嗰個。

154
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:51,590
所選嗰個地區啦，同埋佢個家庭人數，佢需要嗰個單位咧。事實上係我哋無論係新供應嘅單位又好，或者誒回收嘅單位又好，真係冇一個合適嘅係啱佢嗰個選擇。咁所以呢個係一個一般來説係一個原因嚟嘅。我哋只不過特別翻查翻，仲有冇其他嘅原因令到某一啲個案？

155
00:32:51,590 --> 00:33:11,600
我要等做即係比較更加長咧噉，所以當時係一個特別嘅分析嚟嘅。咁所以頭先，議員成日問我哋話：，安琪，如果嗰部分係乜嘢咧？其實就係嗰啲最主要一般嘅原因啦，就係家庭人數或者佢所選嘅地區咁巧，佢要嘅嘢我哋冇呢個供應畀佢，即係個供求嗰個嗰個問題出現咗。哦，即係其實。

156
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:24,340
就係嗰個即係唔配合嘅問題啦。咁如果係呢個係解釋曬嗰嗰個即係二點二七段講嗰六成個案㗎。

157
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:44,740
誒解釋曬㗎啦，係嘛，王女士係啦，即係一般來説就係呢啲理由，其餘嗰啲係啲特別嘅理由。我哋係特別即係去翻查個案，就發現咗即係啲人點解要等咁耐咧，就係有種種嘅特別嘅情況，甚至某啲個案咧就係頭先所講嘅幾種特別情況咧都發生過喺呢個申請嘅人身。係嗱，主席啊，因為咧我都始終覺得係。

158
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,240
房屋處咧係應該公佈多少少嘅，因為。

159
00:33:48,750 --> 00:34:08,760
即係啲街坊想快啲上樓，佢咪要令到自己個案唔係咁特別，咪得咯。就咁簡單啫嘛。即係你你令到人哋知道乜嘢係特別個案，噉佢想快啲上樓，就令到自己個案唔係咁特別，咁咪快啲上樓咯。即係呢個，所以係對對嗰個輪候係有幫助嘅，就係噉。我想指出嘅嘢。同埋誒誒誒。

160
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:22,730
你可即係可以畀多啲，有好多仲要籤租約㗎嘛。如果你你要只一籤咗三年租約一租，噉啊佢就點咧？個情況又係好好大問題喺度。唔係，主席，我相信處長就聽到㗎啦，因為咧嗰輪後拆咧。

161
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:43,020
你係對於啲輪候緊嘅街坊點樣安排自己生活，尤其是住宿嘅問題咧，係好有關鍵性嘅影響嘅。咁所以，如果你係再係透明啲咧，哪怕係得個別嘅個案，嗱呢個點解等咗十年咧？就因為咁咁咁噉，佢令到自己唔使。

162
00:34:43,020 --> 00:35:03,030
等十年啦，咪唔好令到自己變成咁咁咁咪得咯。即係我嘅意思係噉啊，即係會有啲幫助啊。我唔知係唔係咧，即係因為我係係誒理解錯咧。Director Pauzi, Mr. Chairman, actually, when we're talking about special cases, it's when we've investigated into the people that have been on the list. The reasons why we haven't been

163
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:13,220
able to come to an agreement on a particular housing offer, the reason is special to that individual. It's not because of their application. In other words, it's their choice whether or not to accept.

164
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,170
district, or to move districts, or to accept a an area.

165
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:37,460
not quite within their particular location. They understand this because we explain to them when we, particularly for these longer cases, why it's taking so long. But I I think you're right. The basic issue is how much publicity we give to this information, and that we we will be looking at to see if we can increase the publicity. Because I think the more information, better it.

166
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:57,470
係，我我多謝署長接受呢個噉嘅提法啦，因為我覺得即係嗰誒一千幾百個個案咧，即係唔會成為一千幾百個特殊嘅情況啊嘛，即係佢梗係有歸咗幾類嘅。咁如果你講得多啲咧，啲人想快啲上樓。

167
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:17,480
佢咪令到自己唔會跌落嗰一類咁咪得咯。咁有時佢主觀係可以令到嗰個情況改變㗎嘛，噉啊令到佢快啲。嗱，主席當然你如果令到嗰個嗰個輪候冊係短啲咧，嗰個公屋嘅供應係重要嘅。咁當然起樓噉就政府有話冇地啊咁啦，我而家唔講。

168
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,630
我先啦，我有先講，即係審計報告展示出個圖畫先。

169
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,790
嗱，譬如你睇表十六喺四十三頁嗰度咧。

170
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:32,140
我哋就見到咧，嗰個總嘅空置公屋嘅數目。

171
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,590
喺二零一三年三月三十一號咧，係達到一萬二千四百七十一個㗎。

172
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:50,150
咁呢個係佔咗即係全部可出租嘅公屋咧單位嘅大概百分之一點七，咁呢個係一筆少嘅數目嚟嘅。嗯，嗱咁裏邊咧有個將佢細分成A、B、C嘅。

173
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,010
咁A咧就叫不可供出租的單位，嗰度有四千三百七十個。

174
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:09,620
噉啊，我想問一問咧，就係呢個不可供出租嘅單位嗰度咧，如果睇第十九個表咧，主席。

175
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,280
噉就有個細分喎，又。

176
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:22,310
噉我哋就見到咧，佢又列咗A、B、C、D、E、F、G喺注一嗰度，有七個理由嘅。

177
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:43,190
咁嗱，你見到咧，主席嗱，當然最誇張嘅咧就係十年或以上嗰度咧，都總計有六百一十八個嘅喎，嗯，即係吉咗喺度嘅十年喎吉咗。咁嗱，如果睇嗰度咧，有一百七十一個咧，就叫做係A嘅，即係空置嘅長者住屋。

178
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,870
一型單位有待改建為一般公屋單位。

179
00:37:47,580 --> 00:38:07,590
咁究竟個改建點解要十年咁耐咧？我先問一問呢個。係，director夫人。Mr. Chairman, it's very simple. This was a scheme that we introduced to try to provide special units for senior citizens. They were converted from public housing, regular public housing units, and individual senior citizens were.

180
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:27,600
給個個別的房間，房間。房間

181
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:47,610
要just stay on, so we we can't really force them out, and that's the challenge here. We have tried to encourage them to move out into dedicated units within the location nearby and what have you. But some people simply won't move out, and and the policy is to allow them to remain. So that that one is is a challenge for us. I accept that. It's something we're still talking.

182
00:38:47,610 --> 00:39:06,810
講緊about， and indeed we do discuss it fairly regularly in the housing authority because members are also aware of this one。咁咁譬如你你再係打橫睇啊，喺B嗰度咧十年以上有三百六十七個咧係叫空置嘅改建一人單位，有待改建為一般公屋單位。咁點解呢個又等十年都唔喐咧？

183
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,590
係咪又係？

184
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:30,180
Yeah, as I say, that that's something that we have picked up. It's it's the same problem. That these are these are units that have now become vacant, and we are in the process of converting them. That that process is ongoing. The the challenge is that we count the vacancy within the unit. We we

185
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:50,190
Need to change the basis of counting that vacancy because of course if it's got three units for elderly people, theoretically that's two vacancies if there's only one person in that unit. So we need to look at that whole problem. It's it's it's related to this changing use to convert them back into individual family units.有冇時間？

186
00:39:50,190 --> 00:40:01,340
表啊，即係幾時會完成？譬如你你話A嗰度你就話即係講得難聽啲，就要等佢哋先遊啦。咁但係B嗰度咧？誒，director post。

187
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:16,040
For B， we want to try and do the conversion within three months。 I think once we get the vacancy vacant unit available as a complete unit， but as for A， we can't really put a timetable on that because it depends on the individual choice。

188
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,350
咁即係呢個理解又係即係嗰啲三人。

189
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:27,250
就一個門口入嗰啲，咁又係譬如有兩位已經唔喺度啦，但係有一位仲喺度，你就唔收得個係噉嘅意思啦，係嘛？

190
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:47,540
Yeah, let let me describe it. We have a family flat. We may have, say, enough space for two individual rooms, and we may put another room in. That would be three elderly tenants. That was the original objective, so that we'd be able to get three allocations. What's happened is over time, they've moved out for various reasons, but the

191
00:40:47,540 --> 00:41:02,280
誒，我我我想再問埋呢個表咧，佢嗰度有一行咧，喺十年以上嗰度下邊咧，叫做不長嘅。

192
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:20,230
個筆長咧都係五百九十八個，即係話唔知點解係拮咗喺度十，即係即係拮咗點解係唔知啦。咁嗱，如果睇注二咧，佢就話個租務系統冇收錄有關單位對上一次租約嘅終止日期。

193
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:28,130
咁但係係即係我覺得呢個係難以接受嘅係咪咧？而家係有電腦嘅嘛係嘛？係啊，嗯。

194
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:41,650
噉係咪呢啲全部喺你房署有電腦之前已經係吉咗啊？亦或點樣係唔知道上一個租約幾時期滿嘅？點解咁奇怪嘅？

195
00:41:42,040 --> 00:42:02,050
關於誒喺嗰個當做審計報告嘅時間咧，其實當審計處嘅同事畀啲單位嘅時間咧，我哋都好努力，即係抄翻啲電腦記錄噉樣樣。噉就因為有一啲係牽涉，我哋要揾翻個花路出嚟嘅。咁其實大部分我哋提供咗，嬲尾未提供到嗰啲嚟到講咧，其實我哋喺最近嗰一個月裏邊咧都。

196
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:18,950
都已經係揾得翻，即係其實都係有嗰個原因嘅，即係有種種嗰個誒管理上個因素啊，有啲係維修個原因噉樣樣。即係其實誒空置點解唔編配嚟到講咧？其實一路都係有個記錄，不過就曾經有一段時間喺短時間，我哋未揾到嗰個記錄出嚟嘅啫。

197
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:31,650
係，即係我想問啊，處長所講係咪三點一九段裏邊所提及嘅嗰三十五個找不到獲授權預留證據嗰度，而家全部已經找到啦？係咪噉嘅意思啊？

198
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:52,420
係誒，主席係嘅，係哦。咁好啦，咁而家揾到曬啦。噉係咪而家仍然都會繼續坐喺呢啲空置單位度，唔會將佢編配㗎？係即係嗰啲問題解決唔到啦。誒，就都解決得到嘅，就有一啲，譬如我哋係誒。

199
00:42:52,420 --> 00:43:12,430
因為嗰個天花嗰個漏水啊，就嗰啲係比較需要耐少少時間。譬如我哋卅五個咧，我哋睇到有十七個咧，我係拎完村裏邊咧，係頂樓即係某一座大廈裏邊咧，係因為嚴重嗰個天花漏水，噉我哋要跟翻就做嗰個天面嗰個工程裏邊，跟住又。

200
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:30,720
做咗天面工程裏邊咧，亦都有可能話即係做完又流翻水噉樣，所以就誒，其實嗰三十五個嗰個單位裏邊咧，其實我哋每一個都有嗰個記錄喺手嘅。嗯，主席，你可唔可以容許我問埋兩另外兩個表啊？可以可以問唔問？噉我一次過，啊表十八就喺四十六頁嘅。

201
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:51,950
咁呢度咧就嗱，因為你你哋就誒，即係房屋署有個政策㗎嘛，有個理有個承諾咧，就話咧，如果你將啲誒空置單位翻新咧工程咧，四十四日之後做完㗎。咁而家呢個表咧就列出咗有五個單位咧，就全部咧多過四十四日好多嘅。

202
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,310
係。

203
00:43:52,590 --> 00:44:02,490
咁呢啲係管理上出咗問題啊，亦或係真係佢嗰個翻身遇到好大嘅困難咧？因為乜嘢咧？

204
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:22,940
Mr. Chairman, I think the individual flats have various different issues. Some relating to structural issues, water seepage, re-roofing, for example. I mean, those are all described in three one one four C. We have given an explanation. To be frank with you, given the vast number of

205
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:42,950
cases that we process at any one time for refurbishment, having only five that have this problem. Obviously, it's not acceptable, but it's relatively well controlled. But but they they just only pick up five, could be more. Could be more. As I say, we do investigate cases. I mean, in private sector, this is totally unacceptable.

206
00:44:42,950 --> 00:45:02,960
因為，甚至從公共部門，那些是資源，可以被用於需要的人，但他們卻閒置和空置。他們並不是閒置，正如我説的，是那些不能被分配的，因為他們不是適合被分配的狀態。但適合的狀態是你們決定的，不是公眾決定的。

207
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:23,520
Because it takes so long to complete. Well, no. For example, if you have a structural problem, it will take time to rectify that problem. If you have a serious seepage issue, you have to find the source of the seepage and you then need to apply waterproofing and what have you. Each case has to be looked at on its individual circumstances.

208
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,070
如果攞個flat one，

209
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,730
That since September 2008.

210
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:49,020
Issue in July 2011, but works was not started until February 2012. Refurbishment completed date March 2012. It just actually takes one month to complete the the repairing work. Presumably, once we've got the equipment, perhaps Mr Low can answer the question.

211
00:45:49,600 --> 00:46:09,610
誒主席，我想提供少少資料咧，就第一二個單位嚟到講咧，其實都係喺我哋漁灣村個處漁安樓，咁都係兩個嗰個天台嘅單位嘅，就正如好似正話我講，就係話其實我哋做完嗰個天台個防漏工程，但係咧就我哋啲保養組嘅同事咧就。

212
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:29,620
之後咧，觀察咗一段時間，發現有兩個單位，即係其他嗰個成層樓嗰啲，就其他個嗰個滲水嘅情況咧，防樓工程係已經解決曬㗎啦。即係做完咗嗰個重鋪天台之後，但係有兩個單位咧，因為仲有嗰個誒個情況未得到改善，咁所以喺嗰嗰個情況之下咧，我哋亦都。

213
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:49,630
都要追究嗰個承建商誒嗰個承辦商嘅責任，所以我哋好難話將又一路滲水嚟到講咧，你係冇辦法畀新住户入去嘅，因為如果你編配新住户嚟到講咧，新住户又做一個裝修，咁所以喺誒一即係一般嚟到講，如果係非嗰個天台滲漏工程咧，唔應該。

214
00:46:49,630 --> 00:47:09,640
會咁耐嘅，但係有時真係天台滲漏工程咧，變咗喺追承承辦商嗰個責任，同埋要去做處理嗰度咧，誒有可能會誒耐咗少少時間。但係呢兩個係一個真係個別嘅個案嚟嘅。Edward啊，最後一個表咧，主席，我就想睇埋咧表十七咧，嗰度就話可供出租嘅空置。

215
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:29,650
單位個户齡分析啦，噉我哋見到咧有即係嗱，你講一年至到十年啦，加埋八百八十七個係空置嘅單位，但係佢係可以供出租嘅喎。咁呢一個又冇納入到特快公屋編配計劃，噉。

216
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:48,220
即係呢個係係咪都係應該應該要處理嘅問題嚟嘅咧？即係如果你呢啲係釋放翻出嚟咧，即係如果講四百七十個啊，呢啲係冇漏水噉嘅嘢㗎啦，係咪？我相信呢啲係可供出租㗎嘛。咁但係都仍然有咁多個喺度，有四十六個淨係十年或以上添嘅。

217
00:47:48,500 --> 00:48:08,510
咁呢個係咪都有改善嘅空間咧？誒，Director of Housing，阿王小姐、王女士，即係誒，其實呢啲單位咧有一啲咧，譬如有成四啊幾個咧，就係正正喺大澳龍田村嘅。咁點解早前我哋就話一路都編配唔出去，於是我哋就要話將佢就改建為居屋。其實呢個一個例子。

218
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:28,520
另外有啲喺東湧嘅，咁亦都係可能個地點唔係咁多申請者喜歡啦。咁亦都有啲單位咧，就係我哋預留咗一啲屋邨清拆嘅特定用途都有。咁至於話有一啲誒，有啲其實就算我哋納入咗嗰個誒特快編配計劃都好啦，都要編配咗好多次，即係啲先最終先有人。

219
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:48,530
肯肯承租㗎嚇，咁所以呢啲原因都係我哋會盡量希望就係話誒，盡量去盡量再一次去編配噉，但係都再顯示翻就係話有冇申請者肯承租咧？即係呢個都係雙方都要有一個佢嘅意願，我哋都要尊重嚇。多謝主席。Ellen好啊，嗱，主席咁啦，我我覺得就誒。

220
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:53,840
嗯，因為而家始終係有增多足少嘅情況啦，咁如果你話，

221
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:08,910
大家都可能仲記得睇睇佢佢二點四九段咧，就話有個有個阿哥咧，就二零一零年七月咧已經獲得安置嘅，但係咧喺做審計嘅時候咧，佢嘅名都未曾從個從嗰個輪候冊度除嘅噉啊！

222
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:29,360
咁即係變咗咧，你加加埋埋呢啲嘢咧，又有啲十年都急咗又唔排出去啊！嗰個輪候策，你從街坊嘅角度其實係應該用個實際輪候時間啦等等咧，呢啲都可以，我相信啊局長可以考慮下，即係要將佢改善一下啦，因為你你唔。

223
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,400
唔係話揾個。

224
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:51,690
即係界定一個統計基礎，然後去玩一啲數字遊戲啊嘛！你應該從你服務對象，即係嗰啲輪候緊公屋嘅居民咧，佢哋點樣規劃自己嘅生活，係唔係好似主席頭先講簽唔簽個劏房租約咧？咁嚇簽定唔簽咧？噉佢有個有個心。

225
00:49:51,690 --> 00:50:11,700
中有個數有個底，咁所以我就會建議咧，即係你或者房屋署可以考慮下咧，係將個實際輪候時間咧係取替咗嗰個所謂平均輪候時間，然後咧就喺嗰啲表由十六、十七、十八、十九所展現出嚟嘅嗰個圖像咧，盡。

226
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:31,710
量將嗰啲公屋單位釋放翻出嚟啊！咁同埋嗰啲好特別嗰個誒，即係話二點二七段講嗰個咧誒特別行動所總結出嚟嘅，點解有啲人特別係要輪得耐嘅？原來係因為佢自己都要有一啲責任。

227
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:51,720
去付嘅嚇，或者簡區啊等等，咁嗰啲儘量公佈咧。咁成個配套咧就比較好啲，即係變咗大家知道自己所立何地，就少啲係因為係無知無知，唔係因為佢哋自己有問有錯啊，而係因為當局冇講畀佢聽嗰啲知識啊嘛。

228
00:50:51,840 --> 00:51:11,850
嚇嚇，因為不知嚇，因為不知而產生嗰種誒，即係憂慮。噉我呢啲都係誒應該考慮嘅咯嚇。好，跟住咧，跟住啊，局長想講講啊，局主席係主席，我想嚇就誒資訊點樣可以更加透明？呢樣我哋都同意咗，係要要要檢討緊。

229
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:31,860
有啦。嗱，流程可唔可以再改善？即係針對嗰啲空置單位嗰度，我相信我哋會跟進。但係你話用實後時間去取代咧，我覺得嗰度有有問題嘅。點解咧？因為實後時候咧，其時間其實好受到個別嘅申請者，佢唔接受第一個選擇之後，佢嘅考慮係點？佢佢即係有有三次考。

230
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:51,870
即係如果我哋冇當係冇三次選擇，定係得一次選擇咧，咁咪容易掌握啦。但係呢個正正房委會又唔想做到噉樣，因為第一次電腦抽出嚟嘅時候，可能真係唔啱嗰個住户嘅。我哋要明白個住户搬入去佢就好多年㗎啦，亦都唔想夾硬逼佢入去某個佢可能好唔想去嘅一個單位，所以我哋就畀佢有三次選擇。

231
00:51:51,870 --> 00:52:08,510
因為有三種選擇，所以個實後時間就長咗啦。嗱，當然你話誒第一、第二選擇、第三選擇，或者第一選擇同第二選擇之間嘅時間喺流程上有冇改善咧？我哋會去睇嘅。但係如果你話某某延用實後時間去去作準咧，我覺得嗰度係好多變數影響嘅。係。

232
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,120
鬱悶。

233
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:30,770
誒，我哋今日而家係問翻依依一段嗰度，因為如果係再係冇冇誒誒，Candice你係第三嘅第三部。唔係，如果主席啊，如果我流程即係掌握好啲，我諗如果第二個章節做完咧，不如我哋即係嗰啲同事都開始問下第三同。而家去第二個章節嗰度，而家啲同事就係問第二章節啊嘛，係咪啊？好似。

234
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:50,780
好似唔係喎，好似我哋集中係第二嘅咧。而家大家有排啦。老實講，如果你工政府開多兩次未掂啦，而家第二嗰度最多㗎嘛，係咪編配單？即係你你問第二啊？嗱，大家同事係有實頭又係咪？嗱，今次係專即係而家我係專係問第二嗰度。頭先局長咧就話咧嗱，好難講個實。

235
00:52:50,780 --> 00:53:10,790
後嘅時間嘅，咁但係你哋又要玩數字遊戲係嘛？個行政長官又好，係嘛？呢個即係政務司司長行出嚟又好，大大聲公屋輪候時間平均低誒低過三年，咁噏呢啲嘢做咩啫？老實啲咯，係咪？老人家啊，即係有幾多時間飛漲？

236
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:30,800
長者有幾多時間？後生嗰啲幾多時間？老老實實咪得咯，係咪？你唔係成日喺個政策個範圍裏邊咧行出嚟宣示咧，就三年係咪啊？中意玩啲數字遊戲。而家大家坐喺度，大部分都係技術官僚，處理啲問題好清楚嘅，係咪？好翻返我問嘅問題。

237
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,640
二點一六。

238
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:40,250
嗱，頭先都有啲委員即係提過嘅，但係我我又再提一提啦。咁另外二點一八一九嗰啲啊。

239
00:53:40,530 --> 00:54:00,540
嗱，我哋認同審計報告話，將長者一人申請者包括喺一般申請人在內嗰個計算輪候時間係有吹口之嫌，係咪啊？嗱，個報告已經好清楚指出，如果你將兩者分拆計算，一般申請人嘅平均輪候時間咧就三點零一年啊！嗱，而家講緊呢啲都唔係實後時間啦。

240
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,740
O K啊。

241
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:08,350
比起房屋處報稱二點七年為多，如果計嗰個percent提出就十四點八一個percent。

242
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:28,640
所以我哋唔會接納房屋署嘅解釋，就話即係嗱呢個呢一定係都玩數字遊戲啊嘛，係咪？即係房屋署嘅解釋咧，其實你根本唔妨礙分別計算兩類申請者嗰個平均輪候時間嘅係嘛？嗱喺二點八段後邊嗰個表二同埋圖三咧，就已經好清楚。

243
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,780
你房屋署喺度玩數字遊戲，所謂平均輪候時間兩點七年係一個假象嚟嘅。

244
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:55,070
將局部嘅情況包裝，然後推出嚟，結果令到輪候冊上嘅申請人咧就更加不滿。嗱，我哋關心係呢樣啊，局長係咪？你製造民怨啫嘛，已經唔夠公屋單位啦，係咪？已經呢個六八九喺度講大話啦，係咪？而家一年都係起得萬五個單位，廿幾萬喺度排緊，係咪？嗰個已經係死證。

245
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:15,080
但唔係我哋呢度要講嘅，我哋而家講緊審計署嗰個報告行工量。多謝你嗰個已經係死證嚟，冇得救嘅嗰個已經係係咪？噉你咪走去盲搶地咯，係咪？咁即係你睇翻嗰個表二，即係話喺六二點八段後個表二同圖二就已經好清楚踢爆咗你啦，係咪？

246
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:24,480
即係你令到嗰個輪候拆上嘅申請人啊，更加不滿嘅。根據審計報告提供嘅資料，實際平均輪候時間二點九一年至四點一二年。

247
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:44,770
嗱，呢個當然係取決於申請人接受第一、第二或者第三次嗰個配屋嘅安置。嗱，我有個問題就係要噉樣問嘅，就係嗱，由二千年開始，申請人喺三個不同嘅日期各獲編屋誒，即係配屋一處，就唔係一次過獲得提供三個配屋建議。

248
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,930
嗱，呢個係一定要好清楚㗎啦，OK。

249
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:52,490
咁由首次再第三次配屋嘅實後時間，可以長至一點。

250
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,770
二一年即係六十二個星期。

251
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:12,780
O K.配咗畀你，噉我要三次，噉你就喺度講，你哋講係幾多幾多個星期咧？你哋嗰個數同呢個數係一個好大嘅差距嘅嗱。呢十四年來啊，即係由二千年到而家，你哋有冇為呢一個政策進行過檢討啊？嘛？

252
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:28,420
如果一次過畀三個配屋建議嘅，又有咩利弊咧？阿局長，阿局長，誒主席嗰個問題喺誒處方裏邊都即係商榷過嘅，我畀處方分析下先。係，阿王女士。

253
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:48,930
係誒，多謝主席。其實，譬如話，如果我一次過畀三個誒三間即係房畀同一個申請人去揀，咁嗰個情況就我同一時間有三個unit咧係lock up咗，即係我都唔可以分別畀三個人去揀啦。即係嗰個人，因為我哋每一次畀一個offer一個申請人咧。

254
00:56:48,930 --> 00:57:08,940
我哋畀佢起碼有十日嘅時間去考慮，因為都知道佢都要可能去睇下間屋啱唔啱佢啊，噉樣要要告價啊，噉樣咁如果一次過咧，其實呢個時間亦都會多咗嘅。咁即係話同一時間，我有三間屋咧，就係要等緊同一個申請人考慮完畢曬，我先可以配畀第二個。咁如果佢如果佢揀到一個噉，

255
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:28,950
固然好啦嚇，咁但係如果我倒翻轉，我係每一次畀一個佢，有機會佢第一個佢已經接受咗，咁其實嗰另外嗰兩個我諗住咧，就可以分別都畀另外嗰兩位申請人，佢可以同步一齊去考慮，個流程應該係會快啲。咁當然咧就係話，如果以前我哋曾幾何時都嘗試過有一個好短嘅時間都做呢樣。

256
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:48,960
嘅，因為當時咧嗰個誒供應係比較充裕一啲嘅，咁所以我哋係覺得當時係可以嘗試做呢樣，但係後期我哋試驗咗一陣冇幾耐咧，都覺得反而係會將成個流程咧係會拖慢咗，咁所以我哋都翻返去咧就係話每一次都係先畀一個選擇嗰個申請人去諗，因為。

257
00:57:48,960 --> 00:58:08,970
事實上，亦都真係有人第一個選擇，即係咁啱咁巧，就係佢已經覺得好滿意，佢真係接受咗。咁亦都可以係快嘅。咁變咗，我唔需要同一時間咧就hold住兩個單位等一個人去諗咯。我哋可以同一時間三個人同一同步去諗呢三個單位，咁畀輪候插上嘅申請人都公平啲，可以快翻。

258
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:21,630
少少。鬱文，嗱，即係二千年嘅時候就預計咧係啊，即係一第一次到第三次講緊係九九至十二個星期，係嘛？但係報告咧就話六啊二個星期。

259
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:41,920
係咪？你頭先個答案就係話哦，即係喺技術上係嘛？你哋都考慮到即係嚇嗰個編配嘅困難，係咪？你哋即係大家都傾過啦，係咪？咁但係喂，嗰個差距太遠喎，係咪？九至十二個星期同六至二個星期係咪啊？你話畀我聽啦，係咪？好多時我哋接觸啲個案就。

260
00:58:41,920 --> 00:59:01,930
就係咁啦，係咪啊？佢唔係，我哋話畀佢聽唔係，係咪啊？一次三次噉，可能講緊都係即係幾個月嘅啫噃。佢唔係唔係幾個月，係咪啊？講緊係年幾，係咪啊？好啦，即係好似報告裏邊所講嘅呢個所謂個，即係超過六十二個星期，就係遠遠超過你即係。

261
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:08,760
二千年嗰個嗰個預計啦，係咪？噉我覺得你都冇諗過辦法去解決嘅喎。

262
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:29,050
你只係喺個數字上邊係嘛？即係又喺度堆砌嘅啫喎。嗱呢個我唔使你答㗎啦。跟住咧，唔係或者佢佢想答都答啦。啊，處長回應下。處長係啊。Mr. Chairman, this comes down to the number of units available at any one time. In the in the early 2000s, we actually had a large number of units coming on stream as a consequence of ratcheting up the

263
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:29,740
production。

264
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:50,030
呢啲係曾蔭權嘅錯。Well, I'm not talking about any particular reason. I'm just saying that was the fact. I would say that the other issue that's important is where the units are available, because at any one time we may have more units. For example, as we do now in the urban area.

265
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:58,850
People waiting for the new territories will have to wait longer simply because we don't have enough units. So it's about the supply. That's that's the consequence of this problem. You may.

266
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:21,290
咁頭先都答咗啦，係咪？如果你供應足啲嘅呢啲問題就容易解決啦。噉啊係人都知啦，呢個係咪？而家係講緊喺而家供應不足嘅情況底下出現，究竟有冇辦法即係去想辦法改善咁解啫？審計報告都係噉樣講㗎啦，係咪？所以審計處嗰個意見就係話，如果你申請人知道第一次。

267
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:41,300
做第二次或者第三次，或者第二次做第三次嗰個配屋嘅平均等候時間係嘛？咁可能佢就好似頭先啊梁家傑所講，噉佢就會揀㗎嘛，係咪？你幫助佢選擇啫嘛，我哋要求噉啊，方便咗你啦，又係咪先？係嘛？咁呢啲嘢其實係要去做㗎嘛，係咪？即係你你如果畀佢知道個時間，噉係。

268
01:00:41,300 --> 01:01:01,310
可以幫助佢決定係咪應該即時接受呢個配屋建議，或者等下一次嘅配屋機會。然後佢安排佢嘅生活係咪？或者佢自己，包括啲小朋友讀書又好、做嘢又好，佢都可能有啲變化㗎嘛？係咪喺個輪候嘅過程裏邊，即係我哋覺得係需要考慮埋呢樣嘢嘅。呢個即係係一個常識問。

269
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:21,320
問題㗎嘛？你時間越長，噉佢可能喂知道長啦，咁誒還掂都係啦。咁不如攞咗間屋先啦，係咪咁都有㗎嘛？係咪即係審計處即係好明顯地就唔係要求房屋處去左右呢個申請人作出應否即時接受呢個配屋建議嘅決定嘅係咪啊？所以我哋睇喺。

270
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,590
喺嗰個所以誒第二十二段A嗰度咧，二點二二A嗰度咧。

271
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,020
即係。

272
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:38,230
睇翻二點二二A啊，即係嗰個回覆咧，我覺得就係有少少，即係或者你哋都可以解下話嘅啊，有少少偷換概念嘅。

273
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,530
二點二二A嗰度係嘛？

274
01:01:41,810 --> 01:02:01,820
咁即係二點二二喺零二零一三年九月，房屋處回應審計處嘅查詢時，表示啊一大扎文字啦嚇嗰度啊。噉我哋冇嘥時間再講嗱，嗰度咧即係係廢話嚟嘅，我覺得係啊嗱審計事卷已披露嘅資料咧，只係作考慮配屋建議時參考，唔會引起混。

275
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:17,920
混亂嘅喂，房屋署指稱佢哋唔能夠控制呢個等候時間，公屋申請人人數或者建屋土地喺某個程度上亦都唔係房屋署可以控制，亦都唔見得房屋署能夠控制三年上樓嘅目標同埋平均輪候時間，係咪？

276
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:24,980
所以，即係你從另外一個角度嚟睇，你披露更多嘅資料。

277
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,590
噉你就好難。

278
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,380
喺個數字度做功夫，玩數字遊戲。

279
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:38,430
即係當一切公開之後，所有嘅資訊公開之後，噉你點可以堅持話？喂，我而家平均上樓時間係二點七年。

280
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:53,300
點解要整個噉嘅數字出嚟咧？係咪？點解要欺騙公眾咧？請問局長，局長，誒主席，主席，我相信我哋誒喺透明度嗰度咧係可以有誒增加嘅一個需要嘅。

281
01:02:53,580 --> 01:03:13,590
誒，我哋唔係欺騙嗰個市民。實際上咧，我哋過去一直都講咧，就係嗰個輪候嘅時間係以佢登記個申請去到第一次編配。我記得我做局長以嚟，或者以前我喺房委會做委員，誒，小組主席都係噉樣講嘅。明白。但係你呢個特首成日都三年上樓嘅。

282
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:33,630
O.K.，我哋當然要不斷去講，令到公眾明白噉樣三年上樓噉，你解畀我聽三年上樓點解咧？有實後時間，有你呢個第二個時間。鬱乜親？鬱乜親？阿局長答埋先。噉，實際上今次審計處呢個報告咧，而家畀大家知道啊，嗰個實際上涉及嘅時間係點樣樣？當然咧，你話誒不同嘅選擇。

283
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:41,620
之間嗰個流程有冇可以再去優化空間？我哋願意去再睇睇嚇。但係個時間真係噉樣，同埋咧就係議員都同意啦。

284
01:03:41,900 --> 01:04:01,910
即係如果供應係不足嘅話，或者某啲區個供應不足咧，的確係造成某啲人士會等耐啲嘅啊。噉啊，我哋可以提出嚟喺呢個房委房屋委誒呢個事務委員會嗰度啦，去跟進呢個問。唔係我我我即係誒講起呢個即係所謂嗰個輪候時間嘅時候，都係審計率報告裏邊講嘅嘢嚟嘅。嗱，二點二三。

285
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,760
啱咧，睇翻個表三啦，啊！

286
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:24,200
咁喺個表三裏邊咧，就好清楚㗎啦。係嘛，只要將申請人獲首次配屋後凍結時段一並計算作為呢個輪候時間咧，平均輪候時間為二點七年咧，呢個一定係假象嚟㗎啦。OK，嗱有二十九個percent嘅申請人咧，等候要三年嘅超過，當中有七千五百五十二人等候咗五至十年十。

287
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:41,140
五人等候超過十年，嗱，我曾經喺房屋事務委員會咧嘅會議上面要求房屋署唔好僵化處理呢啲申請，係嘛？啲積壓已久嘅個案咧，需要特別處理。嗱，我嘅意見同審計處呢個報告係不謀而合。你睇翻二點二六至二點七段。

288
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,740
就知道啦，二點二七段。

289
01:04:44,090 --> 01:05:04,100
即係誒呢個，我哋知道咧，就喺二零一二年咧，即係房屋處都展開一啲特別行動，對呢一類申請作出調查，噉就發現有八百六十宗申請係屬於未提及有冇合理原因導致即係等候得耐嘅啊，或者係純屬即係遺漏嘅個案。

290
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:24,110
係嘛噉就我哋希望房屋處可以交代下嗰個進展啦。係嘛，阿鬱敏啊，今朝早啊，梁家傑已經問咗呢個問題，答咗啦。好噉啊，問我跟住有個方嘅喺呢個二點三二B嗰度咧，就提到房屋處就截至二零一三年六月底輪候申請人嘅住屋情況所作嘅跟進分析。

291
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:44,120
進行定稿作為兩次分析嘅更新啊。雖然呢個同帳目委員會無關，主席，我希望咧即係房屋處可以將啲有關嘅結果咧提交畀呢個房屋事務委員會。OK啊？誒，我哋有冇收到啊？OK，咁得啦。好噉啊。另外，我一個問題咧，就問嗰個實施配額同計分制嗰度嘅啊。

292
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:55,570
嗯，就誒，我覺得喺譬如你睇翻二點四三段咧，房屋處相關嘅回應係迴迴避咗審計報告對配額同埋計分制提出嘅意見。

293
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,340
二點四三段。

294
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:18,020
係講OK咁喺二點三八段嗰度咧，睇翻二點三八段咧，現行嘅配額同埋計分咧，就傾向鼓勵年青人啊，即係最好係十八歲一屆，即係一達有十八歲啦，到夠稱啦，就最低合資格年齡嗱。根據呢個機制申請公屋嗱，即使佢哋冇一啲基本筆錢。

295
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:38,030
嘅住屋需要，但係因為現行經濟機制底下咧，你加税又加分啦，係咪？誒，輪候多一年又加分啦，咁大家咪喺度等咯，係咪？我哋嗰陣時大學畢業嘅時候就脱離公屋，而家大學畢業嘅時候就開始申請公屋，係嘛？呢個社會嘅演變就係咁啦，係嘛？咁好。

296
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:47,720
噉係我要問嘅問題就係話，即係好似今朝早阿家傑興都有提過嘅呢個十八歲嘅問題嘅，係咪？定係你提啊？梁一勤嚟，三個都提咗。

297
01:06:48,790 --> 01:07:07,670
我提咗啦，但係你可以畀你意見咗問。唔係我我意見就係咧，即係假設你冇新嘅申請人，有冇人撤回申請？如果按照每年唔超過二千個單位嘅配額計算，需要幾多年咧，先至可以完全滿足而家配額同埋計分制之下嗰個申請人咧，超過十萬名。

298
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:28,320
有冇計過呢啲數咧？鄭文嗱，我意思就係嗱，我哋講曬頭先嗰啲噉，但係一條大數係嘛，再加埋而家要起嘅個公屋，你有冇呢啲噉嘅數據咧？有冇諗過咧？有冇分析過咧？張文啊，未來嗰五年你有七萬五個單位，我知啊，每一年加七千個，但係二萬二個單位係配合配。

299
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,720
但係解決唔到而家問題啊嘛！嚇，局長。

300
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:52,010
誒主席，我想黃議員所針對就係配額計分制底下個人數越嚟越多啦。的確咧，而家個趨勢好似咧就係啲年青人十八歲就排隊啦嚇。咁審計處長有噉嘅誒觀察，其實咧，好似我剛才回答其他議員都提到咧誒長策會喺長遠房策略嗰個誒擬定過程裏邊都有噉嘅觀察。

301
01:07:52,010 --> 01:08:12,020
嘅，所以我哋會喺將來咧建議咧，就係話定期去查核而家係輪候緊計分制嘅人士，咁確保咧佢哋誒都係仍然符合呢個誒申請資格嘅。可唔可以即係話誒誒呢個接納審計處嘅建議，就剔除輪候冊上不合資格嘅申請人咧？

302
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:21,760
令到呢個輪候冊嘅申請人數目能夠確實反映出社會對公屋嘅真正需要。誒，主席，呢個正正係我哋嘅目標。啊，好。

303
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:28,680
誒跟住咧就係誒Harkin嚇問第二段嚇有冇啊冇OK阿Paul。

304
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:49,040
主席，剛才我聽到誒應該係秘書長係嘛？佢有個講法，我輕輕想追翻少少先嘅，就係話關於嗰個你哋而家諗緊個QPS嗰個計分制咧，考慮其中一啲因素可能會係減分嘅咧。我聽到你話好似係讀得書多會減分㗎嘛？即係好擔心呢個咧，即係如果你。

305
01:08:49,040 --> 01:09:06,200
有噉嘅方向咧，我就即係我相信，我相信市民未必會贊成，因為呢個似乎就係， Mister Chief，你澄清下有冇噉嘅諗法咧？局長，Mr. Chairman， all I said was that was something we could look at. The whole point is the suggestion was made that we should look at some way to deduct points or

306
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:26,490
disincentivise people to apply. So what I've said is that we're going to consider all options, one of which might be that. But let me assure you, one of the reasons that we're waiting for the outcome of the LTHS is to get feedback on this, to see what the public will be prepared to accept, and this will have to be considered and debated by the housing authority. This is not something we.

307
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:46,500
我諗，could be look at就唔好啦，即係我諗should look at就多，即係呢個即係先啱。因為我想睇睇第二點三九誒嗰度咧，就有關於誒有個講法咧，就係話而家即係直至到零三年嘅三月三十一號咧，對住一三年嘅三月三十一號咧。

308
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:55,760
就喺嗰個QPS裏邊，十一萬一千五百二十八宗個案裏邊咧，九十六點八嘅percent咧都係未喐過嘅。

309
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,100
啊！呢個呢個，大家睇到嚇。嚇，局長。

310
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:20,440
誒主席，依個係反映到咧，就係嗱，當因為而家喺嗰個配額計分制裏邊咧，好多係年紀比較輕嘅，咁要按照而家計分嘅方法，誒牽涉到咧就係佢幾時開始排啦。咁固然咧年幾大啲，可能佢排耐咗啦。第二就年歲數都係一個誒分數嘅來源嚟嘅，所以變咗係。

311
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:26,470
一啲高歲數嗰啲咧，誒想去即係有有機會誒安置嘅機會係大好多嘅。

312
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:47,530
嗱，當剛剛才就誒誒長唔喺度啦，我哋都講過關於我哋即係好冇話，應該將嗰個水分咧減低佢咧，甚至乎可能卅歲先開始接受申請，其實可能仲現實啲添啦。因為十八歲申請都係得個白等嘅啫嚇。不過另一個，我想睇翻二點四五段啦。咁咧，九三年咧，你哋當時咧就有個。

313
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,180
即係叫誒。

314
01:10:49,540 --> 01:11:07,940
租住房屋小組，即係以前嘅前管理小誒小組啦嚇，誒就有個措施咧，就係會有個所謂覆查嘅制度嘅，即係兩年度咧就會誒查一次。我想理解當時係只係查一次嘅啫，即係兩年查到就算嘅啦，而唔係定期查嘅，係咪咧？局長？

315
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:28,230
誒主席，誒我哋就唔知道當年點解係淨係複查一次，但係咧喺而家嚟講咧，誒本嚟咧就一般輪候拆咧，我哋就冇特別去複查，因為點解到佢誒可能排三年啊，揾上下咧，如果佢輪到佢嘅話咧，到時就會實際上去去睇佢嗰個最新嘅狀況嘅。咁誒計。

316
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:37,290
分制底下咧，過去我哋就冇覆查，一直到今天為止都冇覆查制度。噉係咪需要引進覆查制度咧？就係而家我哋考慮嘅嘅一個可能做法。

317
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:57,710
突破嗱，睇翻二點四六咧，就話呢個覆查制度咧，就由於二千年嘅時候咧嗰個輪候拆縮短咗啦，於是你就取消咗嘅啊。呢個係歷史嚟嘅。咁其實即係你哋曾經都做過啲啱嘅事情嘅喎，只不過就即係當時就停咗啦。咁又到到而家十幾年之後咧，都一路冇做翻。當然我我好開心聽。

318
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:16,750
聽到局長講咧，就話你哋會再考慮翻覆查啦。咁呢個覆查，你哋覆稿裏邊咧係會係定期啊，定點樣做法咧？局長，誒主席，誒如果係針對配額計分制底下嘅申請者作呢個所謂覆查咧，誒喺長遠房屋策略督導委員會嘅討論裏邊咧，係定期嘅。

319
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,040
好。

320
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:20,990
誒。

321
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:42,400
嗱，我我哋都較早前都講過咧，就話我哋其實所針對咧其中一個最重要喺呢個環節，起碼啦嚇，就係關於嗰個名冊嗰個水分嘅問題。啊，咁剛才局長亦都離開咗，因為另外會議啦。噉我哋都講過話，即係起碼我自己講過咧，即係首尾，即係而家潮流興講，我哋喺講政改咧，講前門中門。

322
01:12:42,400 --> 01:13:02,410
尾門咧，我用翻呢個例子啦嚇。噉我就都曾經建議過，係咪應該擺多啲資源喺前門嗰度處理啲工作咧？噉我想聽聽局長你呢方面你點睇法？局長，你使唔使同一同你同事傾過去答咗乜嘢？今日其實較早前喺我仲喺度嘅時候，都回應過類似問題嘅，當時都解釋我啲同事。

323
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:22,420
解釋過咧，就點解我哋覺得喺誒，因為到佢真係輪到佢有編配配房嘅時候咧，噉我哋都要全全面去睇佢所有嘅申報嘅嘢嘅，確定係符合呢個誒安置嘅資格。咁變咗佢誒輪候期間，可能好多狀況嘅轉變。咁誒，我講喺一般輪候冊嗰啲。

324
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:42,620
誒，我哋有抽查，但係呢個唔係去，即係唔係一個覆查制度，所以個性質係唔同嘅。但係點都好，因為咧，我哋有嗰個所謂安誒編配第一個選擇嘅嗰個時間平均停留時間嘅目標啦，所以我哋估計咧，佢哋唔需要等好耐咧，我哋就需要去進行一個全面對佢哋。

325
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,260
嘅嘅誒資格嘅一個審查嘅，係阿波。

326
01:13:46,540 --> 01:14:06,550
主席，我我啊，局長，我諗你都即係經常有坐飛機㗎啦。咁當條龍上機嗰陣時候，長嗰陣時咧，就航空公司嘅職員好多時咧會揾多一兩個同事咧喺條龍中間咧，就同你處理下你嘅passport啊，睇下你嘅機票啱唔啱數啊，有冇排錯隊啊噉樣。其實呢啲好係好簡單嘅常識嚟嘅，即係如果我哋成個制度咧能夠可以喺個。

327
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:26,560
喺條隊度咧，不斷咧去所謂manage佢咧，即係即係不斷管理佢咧，其實係可以正正好及早咧，將任何排錯隊嘅人咧叫佢唔好排啦，或者將即係分開咗，將最後工序去到counter嗰度做嘢咧，早啲做咗先。咁呢一方面咧，其實當局點解唔可以做多啲嘢咧？誒，主席，嗱，我哋要分開兩條隊嚟睇，一條咧。

328
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:46,570
就係配額嘅分制，咁嗰度我哋講咗啦。我哋係會考慮咧係有一個定期嘅一個覆查噉樣嘅一個做法嘅。但係至於一般輪候策，即係長者同埋家庭嘅申請者咧，我哋而家嗰個平均輪候時間嘅目標咧啊，當然係用我哋教早前所解釋嗰個嗰個定義，就話登記。

329
01:14:46,570 --> 01:15:06,580
個申請到誒第一次編配，我哋係用三年，就係平均量嘅時間。好啦，你定期，如果你做到每年都做一次，嗰度牽涉個成本，嗰度牽涉即係即係對申請者嘅嗰個幹擾，亦都係要要平衡嘅。如果你話兩三年做一次，兩年做一次，三年做一次，其實咧，假如我哋嗰個平均量。

330
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:26,590
時間嗰度係掌握得好嘅話咧，到佢真係有第一次編配嘅時候咧，已經有一個全面嘅誒審查㗎啦。咁個效果就同一個覆查係相近嘅，係破。我諗喺呢部分我差唔多啦，除非我哋大家再去考部分。就其他啊啊，跟住咧就係梁生啊，梁生未問之前，我想問一問局。

331
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:46,600
長，你講好多次長策，噉我想問一問長策同埋依個房屋委員會個關係喺邊度？你委員會有自己嘅嗰個誒權喺度嘅，你唔係每樣嘢係長策帶住你嚟走嘅。噉你喺依方面，你可唔可以解釋畀我哋聽？係房屋委員會嘅責。

332
01:15:46,600 --> 01:16:06,610
責任長策嘅指導，你係點去執行嘅？幾時點？係咪你要改？因為長策，如果冇長策，房屋委員會係咪唔做呢啲嘢咧？誒，如果係長策講，個長策講啲嘢未必係配合到房屋委員會嘅政策嘅。噉係邊方面係你哋要去點去睇咧？可唔可以解解釋畀我聽？

333
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:26,630
誒主席就根據房屋條例咧，房委會佢係完全係有權去就即係編配啊、管理依個公屋資源咧，佢定嘅政策嘅。咁誒，但係喺長遠房屋策略督導委員會嘅討論裏邊咧，亦都係有提出好多牽涉到點樣更加誒公平有效。

334
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:36,130
哋去運用公共資源，咁嗰啲都對依個房委會係有影響嘅。噉係咪住房委會睇唔到咩叫公平？誒唔係睇唔到，睇唔到咩係？

335
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:56,420
其實房委會係任何時候都可以去去去誒誒處理相關問題，只不過話咧咁啱線，等於即係房委會唔需要等到深計處報告一樣可以處理有關問題一樣。但係既然有咗深計處報告，既然知道咧，就呢個長遠複測咧進行緊呢個諮詢，咁所以咧就即係從政府立場回應誒本會。

336
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:16,430
就話我哋會將所得到嘅嘢咧，因為因為我有噉嘅感覺啊，局長，即係你哋每一個縣係交咗長策個，但係個房屋委員會已經喺度好多年，即係幾十年㗎啦。噉你你哋唔需要挺到長策去講，你都可以而家現現在你應承咗啊，審計處長講嘅嗰啲方向啊。

337
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:36,440
去去做㗎啦嘛，係咪？誒，主席，實際上就審計處處長提出具體各項建議咧，喺文件裏邊，房屋處處長亦都回應咗嘅。啊，呢啲當然都需要有部分啦嚇，係需要誒房委會去政策上去處理嘅。咁可唔可以畀個時間表？邊啲係去做，邊啲係唔會去做？我哋要寫個報告嗰度。誒，主席，我需。

338
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,580
將裏邊所有誒。

339
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:52,000
署長同意審計處提出嚟嘅建議，如果需要係去呢個防委會嘅，都會轉交畀防委會。O K，好多謝你。誒，跟住兩聲兩聲後，就跟住啊。

340
01:17:52,280 --> 01:18:04,140
啊！鬱敏同埋都係問依一依部分㗎嚇。誒誒，第三部分㗎嘞喎。唔係，對唔住，第二部分。第二部分我唔準備出問。OK，咁咩？啊啊，鬱敏嚇，鬱敏唔該。誒。

341
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:24,610
多謝主席。嗱，我想講下咧，就係頭先局長提到嗰個即係防委會啊，或者嗱，因為即係其實有啲回應咧，你哋推咗長策會啊，有防委會啊。咁大家都知道啦，局長就防委會主席，處長就副主席，係咪啊？都係行。

342
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:44,620
政主導咧，梗係關你哋事㗎啦，係咪？唔好賴咧。你成個決策嘅過程係咪？跟住就到房屋處，就係嗰啲行政部門咁咁好清楚㗎嘛，係咪？嗰個嗰個職責嘅範圍冇得賴嘅，係咪？係嘛，即係冇必要去啊！而家長策會又乜啦，跟住房委會乜啦，冇講呢啲嘢冇意義。

343
01:18:44,620 --> 01:19:04,630
我基本上覺得你就係房委會嘅主席嚟㗎嘛，係咪？佢就係副主席嚟㗎嘛，全部都你係管曬㗎啦。行政執行即係決策都係一條邊㗎啦，係咪先？嗱，我想講下嗰個誒，即係誒處理申請嗰個部分啊。噉啊，適用於嗱，睇翻二點五六段啦。

344
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:12,580
啦，因為前邊嗰啲其實我都想講，不過而家因為時間問題處理申請嗰個啊，二點誒二點五六啊。

345
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:34,520
咁誒適用於即係話公屋申請嘅聲明書有十七款，但係呢啲噉嘅聲明書咧就唔喺唔係附連喺申請表或者隨申請表派發嘅，只能夠喺呢個房署嘅網站下載。而申請表或者公屋輪候冊申請須知，甚至係即係話誒何誒呢個。

346
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:54,530
填寫申請表、雙語短片咧啊，都冇再述聲明書提供嘅途徑同埋用途係嘛，亦都冇適當填寫或者交回聲明書，可能係造成即係大量申請個案凍結嘅原因嚟嘅係嘛。咁所以我我希望即係話即係局長或者你可以。

347
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:55,020
係。

348
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:15,570
話畀我哋聽，咁呢個有冇辦法？有有冇改善嘅空間咧？用邊個講法？用咪阿或者金珠組阿黃女士答咗呢個問題，我等叫佢跟進好唔好啊？啊，局長。啊，主席，係，的確係今朝回應咗嘅。阿黃女士。O K，噉就表十嗰度。你畀阿黃女士。O K，O K，你答。多謝主席。係。

349
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:35,580
誒，其實嗰啲聲明書嗰十七款咧，其實喺附錄E嗰度咧都列咗出嚟嘅。咁其實如果你大家睇翻咧，就係其實唔係每一個申請人咧都需要填曬嗰十七個聲明書嘅，要睇下佢嗰個實際情況嘅。咁所以我哋本來咧就話，如果我將呢個十七份聲明書都夾埋喺嗰個申請表度咧，就會令到嗰

350
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:55,590
個申請表咧就好好包攜流複雜啦噉。不過因應審計處處長嘅建議咧，我哋都會睇下點樣可以修訂翻嗰個申請須知啦，或者嗰個短片啦，即係介紹畀啲申請人知嘅短片，等佢哋可以更加清晰知道，即係究竟點樣填呢啲申請誒呢啲聲明書啦，係按佢咩唔同嘅需要去需要填邊。

351
01:20:55,590 --> 01:21:15,600
邊一款嘅聲明書喺呢一方面，我哋會去詳細睇點可以改進翻嘅啦。多謝主席。另外，關於嗰個處理申請嘅問題，第二點六零段啊，咁個表啦嚇個表啊表十啦，就列出過去五年登記同埋公務員配額小組嗰個審查嘅申請成功登記有四。

352
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:35,610
四十七個percent，但係因為資料或者文件唔齊全而退回嘅咧，就竟然有三廿九個percent。嗱，呢個咧唔係一個偶然嘅現象。房屋處對佢對呢一種噉嘅情況，又係好似視若無睹嘅，畀我哋覺得，即係有咁高嘅退回數字，就反映出個申請表或者個公屋。

353
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:55,620
輪候冊申請數字，甚至嗰個短片個雙語短片提供嘅指示，可能係有問題啊嘛！啲問題啊，包括係不足或者係誤導。你如果能夠及早修正，就可以節省登記同埋公務員配額小組審查嘅時候嘅功夫，你就會即係節省一啲資源嘅，係嘛？咁至於表十一嗰度。

354
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:09,970
仲誇張係嘛？即係嗰個分析嘅，竟然有申請人需要重新遞交申請表四次，遞交申請四次以上嘅係嘛？就算係重新，即係話新遞交申請一至二次都好多。

355
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:30,260
嗰個資料即係誒進一步引證申請表或者個公屋聯考冊申請須知個指示，好顯然就係有問題㗎嘛，係咪？噉啊，黃小姐請問呢個點樣解決咧？啊，黃小姐。誒，多謝主席。誒，譬如如果我哋要拒絕佢或者退回咧，拒絕就可能根本就唔符合我哋嗰個資格啦，退回就係。

356
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:50,270
係話，譬如佢有一啲資料係唔充足嘅，或者有要遞交某一啲文件，佢冇遞交嘅。噉我哋而家嘅做法咧，就係話每一次我要退回或者拒絕佢咧，我哋都會有封信，即係個covering話畀佢聽。其實係因為咩理由，我哋要拒絕佢，或者你係欠咩文件需要即係交翻嘅。咁而家我哋因應審計處處長嘅建議咧。

357
01:22:50,270 --> 01:23:10,280
如果連續兩次退回，佢仍然係啲文件係不足嘅時候咧，我哋會主動打電話畀嗰個申請人，就係話即係睇下佢係咪誤解咗我哋某啲嘢，或者我哋佢溝通上面有啲唔清楚咧。咁希望喺度做一個改進。咁頭先佢都講咗啦，就話喺個申請須知啊，或者嗰個短片咧，我哋都會睇一睇可以點樣去改。

358
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:30,290
改善翻，令到成件事個流程會清晰啲。多謝主席。耀文啊，耀文啊，局長啊，局長今次係應承咗咁做嘅。O K，咁得，因為喺二點八零段嗰度咧，就即係誒房署都有表示話要可以提供更多嘅指引，係咪同埋話考慮修改嗰個誒申請須知啊？噉我哋都明嘅。嗱，我哋睇翻二點。

359
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:34,640
點六三段嗰度，其中一個問題就係審計署抽查嗰五宗申請。

360
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:39,820
咁全部申請都超過一年嘅啊，先至獲準喺呢個輪候冊上登記。

361
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:55,190
咁但係房屋處就話平均輪候時間兩點七年，喂大佬，即係嗰個申請，即係喺個輪候冊上登記嗰度需要嘅時間都咁啦，係咪講乜嘢啫？係嘛，得負責官員即係。

362
01:23:55,930 --> 01:24:15,940
跟佢有冇尊重過嗰啲即係輪候申請人咧？定係話呢啲係用公堂廉租屋嚟嘅係嘛？或者好似有啲香港有啲人覺得為你申請公屋嘅人，咪係咪你偏公屋，即係有公屋住嗰啲人係政府益你嘅係嘛？啊或者叫做誒你你又冇嘈啦，冇解咁多啦，咁好多人。

363
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:32,500
都有呢啲噉嘅觀念啦，係咪？社會上邊可能有，但係我哋嘅睇法梗係唔係啦，係咪？因為呢個雖然係公帑係資源，但係有啲人係需有需要，你就要畀佢㗎啦，係咪？合乎資格你就畀佢，唔係點解要資產審查啊？唔通你畀間公屋我啊？如果問題係你冇公屋，但係你可以問問題啊。

364
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:47,230
我都可以輪候公屋嘅，你知唔知啊？我冇得撈，但係我資產喂少過啲，我都輪得嘅，大佬。因為你做語言，理論上我都係有資格輪候公屋嘅，唔好話我冇啊！我係有資格輪候公屋，有冇先？你話同樣我有冇資格輪候公事？

365
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:50,490
嚇用完。

366
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:51,730
冇問題。

367
01:24:52,010 --> 01:25:12,020
嗱，即係誒，就係頭先嗰個啦。你有冇尊重過啲人咧？我想問下，定係就係當佢係一個餵你嚟申請噉啊，係咁㗎啦，係咪？你冇冇諗過感受咧？因為你可唔可以問佢個制度？呢好難問。就個制度咁咪制度咯。頭先講咗啦，二點六三段咪睇翻二點。佢知道講緊乜嘅？

368
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:32,350
誒主席，正正因為我哋唔係就咁求其去處理申請，我哋確保咧係有需要嘅人，啊公平地去分配誒公屋資源，所以我哋要睇佢，譬如話喺入息方面嘅證明啊，其他方面各樣嘅證明文件。有啲時候，如果佢係提交文件唔充足嘅時候咧，我相信前線嘅房署。

369
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:52,360
佢要好公正地、好審慎地去處理咧，呢個啱嘅。但係當然流程方面有冇改進空間，同埋喺資訊發放方面，我哋可唔可以做得好啲咧？呢個係我願意咧，係請房署咧係去跟。阿鬱敏即係話：你以人為本嚇嚇，唔係尊重人啦，要咪嗱，因為你審計處講過五五宗嘅申請裏。

370
01:25:52,360 --> 01:26:01,840
只有一個個案，其他你都冇去打個電話去聯絡個申請人，係咪啊？咁咁即係算係點啫？係咪？即係。

371
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:05,590
審計署抽出嚟嘅呢個係嗱，好清楚嘅。

372
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:25,880
即係，所以我希望，即係呢個真係應該要改善啦，係咪？應善即係你改善㗎啦。啊，OK。咁另外喺誒，即係二點七五段嗰度，我而家濃縮翻啦，因為我而家跌咗嗰啲。二點七五，二點七五喺零八至到零九年至到二零一二一三年度咧，就登記誒。

373
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:34,670
誒及公務員配額小組同埋公屋編配小組所轉介嘅個案進行調查，平均個案調查時間係大幅增加。

374
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:47,010
增幅達到四啊三個percent，四四十三個percent，由一零九日增至一五，增增加到一百五十六日，同埋另外就係七十二個percent，由九啊六日增加到一百六十五日。

375
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:59,000
喺二零一二至一三年度平均個案調查時間咧，達到五個月以上，超過以即係話預定嘅嗰個三個月嘅時間，房署可唔可以解釋個原因咧？

376
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,470
我絕仗。

377
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:21,780
誒或者差兩三係兩三兩三係唔該，主席誒正話，我較早前都解釋過，即係誒最主要嘅原因咧，就係誒個別嘅申請人咧喺收到我哋中央調查組嗰邊再約見嘅時間咧，佢係冇依嗰個指定時間，又或者冇提交嗰個資料，咁當。

378
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:41,790
當然，我哋亦都，我哋要睇翻，因為審計署報告亦都摘成我哋就係話要研究下點解會有一個噉嘅情況，延遲咗咁耐都都冇處理。咁一個不爭嘅事實就係話，我哋誒喺過往一兩年裏邊咧，我哋係比較中央對咧係擺咗多少少資源喺嗰個攬用公屋嗰個樹嘅。咁但係。

379
01:27:41,790 --> 01:28:01,800
呢一個唔係藉口嚟嘅，即係話如果喺處理呢個工作做得唔好嘅時間咧，咁所以我哋其實已經一個誒新嘅指引，就係話一定要啲同事咧三個月內完成，完成唔到嘅時間咧，佢要向中央小隊小個中央調查小組嗰個經理或者副經理咧係申請一個延期嘅。噉我哋。

380
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:21,810
會誒加多少少資源咧處理確保咧嗰個真係我哋可以喺三個月內即係完成嗰個所謂深入嘅調查嚇。唔該，主席。唔係，但係你有有咩保證啫？你而家又係講啫嘛？玉玉敏啊，佢今朝答咗答咗個問題咧，就話佢哋而家係翻翻中央上邊嗰度，然後嘅。

381
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:41,820
點去做？佢哋要加多啲人手喺度。唔係我知啊，今朝問咗。噉你你你你你有咩保證啫？嗱，你而家嗱老實講個數目就係百幾日㗎嘛，嗯，係咪係唔止三個月㗎嘛？講緊有啲係成即係誒四五個月㗎嘛。噉你而家話啊，我我會增加資源，噉你可唔可以畀個時間表？我幾時可以解決先？

382
01:28:41,820 --> 01:29:01,830
先誒，唔係即係我唔中意，我哋我哋覺得只係政府成日都係噉樣，翻返去佢嗰度，跟住到時又冇下文。唔係個下文，我哋嘅PAC會跟進㗎啦嚇，因為我哋claim sheet嗰度唔會畀佢，唔會畀佢立亂去講嘢唔準。唔係因為呢個係加劇咗個凍結申請嘅問題，大家都好清楚㗎。有咩解釋？

383
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:21,840
唔該，主席。誒，舊有嘅個案當然已經係完成曬嘅啦，即係而家係講緊舊有嘅。噉我哋咧就會確保，因為我係由我自己出咗個新嘅指引嚟到講咧，就係話誒有誒唔可以達標嘅時間咧，噉我哋自己總部嘅層面裏邊咧，喺經理級以上嚟到講咧，我哋自己會檢視住嘅。噉我哋希望。

384
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:41,850
㗎啦，係嘛？係冇錯，已經係執行咗㗎啦，已經係畀咗。因為嗰啲舊嘅個案已經處理咗啊嘛。咁但係你陸續有嚟㗎嘛，係咪？你一定要保證而家新嗰啲一定係三個月內要搞掂啊嘛，係咪？係咪噉啊？誒，我哋嘅指引就係當然啦。如果真係有一個申請人，佢遞咗個申請表，就我哋叫佢嚟，佢真係唔嚟嘅時間，噉。

385
01:29:41,850 --> 01:30:01,860
咁當然，我係咪話為你呢啲三個月內你唔嚟，我即刻要取消你？噉我夾硬為咗話一定要嗰個三個月個案，咁唔係噉樣樣。但係我就誒向語言學保嚟到講咧，其實我哋係有嗰個信心，即係絕大部分合理嘅個案咧，我哋一定可以喺三個月內過關唔死。鬱敏，誒我問完，咪啊？

386
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:06,160
而家我阿家傑就係最後一個，我話阿阿家傑同埋阿坡。

387
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:18,310
我我其實都好短嘅啫。頭先因為我聽留意到啊，局長咧就話誒，即係用實際輪候時間嚟到計算咧，就唔係好實際，因為你。

388
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:23,900
唔知道幾多人咧，係第二次、第三次誒因素啊，比較複雜。

389
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,870
噉啊，當然我我就想聽一聽咧，就即係誒。

390
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:33,560
有冇可以考慮一下咧？就係，就算你唔改變呢個所謂平均輪候。

391
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:53,870
誒時間係三年噉嘅論述嘅方式啦，可唔可以同時都每年按年公佈嗰個實際嘅誒輪候時間咧？咁呢個第一個問題啦。誒，與此同時咧，為咗增加個透明度咧，亦都可以係。

392
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,500
嗯。

393
01:30:54,780 --> 01:31:12,640
即係公佈嘅時候咧，就公佈埋即係嗰啲第二次、第三次先至成功配屋嘅嗰個理由係乜嘢，或者甚至第三次都配唔到嘅係乜嘢，噉啊好清楚啦。咁變咗你你講個輪候時間咧，就唔使我哋嘥太多時間。

394
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:32,930
令到個效率高啲啦，即係我哋要同啲街坊解釋啊，噉樣。咁呢個誒，第一想問一問咧，第二咧就我諗阿局長，當然大家都知道咧，而家最新嗰個即係一人即係非長者嗰個申請咧，就係八千八百蚊啊嘛。即係如果你係計埋嗰百分之五嗰啲強。

395
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:35,560
積金嗰啲咧就九千三百四十七蚊。

396
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:42,510
咁如果大學生一揾到份工咧，照計都唔會奀過九千三嘅。

397
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:55,760
咁嗱，我啊睇到申請公屋嗰個表格咧，其實佢嗰個第七部分嘅第五點咧係有噉嘅規定嘅，就係倘若我或者我們的家庭狀況有任何改變。

398
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:05,030
就便會立即啊，就誒通知房委會，否則房委會可取消公屋嘅申請噉樣。

399
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:08,340
噉我就想問下，即係你處理嗰啲。

400
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:19,020
即係非長者嘅輪候冊嘅時候咧，你會唔會都考慮一下？即係嚴格去執行呢一個第七部分嘅第五點。

401
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:39,370
誒或者換個角度講咧，畀一啲有因佢哋係會自動自覺去誒向房委會去申報啊，即係譬如你可能會扣佢分啊，或者將來冇冇得申請咁之類啦。咁誒減少你嘅行政上。

402
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:59,380
上嗰個困難，亦都可以咧令到個輪候測咧係更加準確地去反映個實際情況。我想問一問呢兩點。誒，局長。誒，主席先答誒第二個問題咧，就誒我哋係會檢討而家嗰個配額計分制嘅噉，無論係分數方面嘅計算啊。

403
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:19,390
或者係誒誒點樣定期去做嗰個誒複查啊？噉樣噉，剛才兩員提嗰啲方法我都去睇，但係當然啦，喺整體嚟講，我唔係特別指個計分制，但係整體嚟講咧，房署同埋房委會咧都希望喺任何嘅誒措施嘅設計咧，都係做到情理兼兼備嘅，因為最。

404
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:39,400
最終嚟講，我主席你都講啦，我哋係以人為本，都我哋針對係人，唔係淨係數字啊。誒，平均個時間咧，我解釋咗。剛才點解我哋覺得咧係用翻誒目前房委會個定義，但係我同意咧喺資訊方面發放要講得多啲，同埋咧，因為我哋而家每年都要做嗰個針特別針對一啲佢停留長嘅時候。

405
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:47,210
我哋個案分析咁喺嗰度咧，我覺得咧喺實後時間嗰度，我哋可以睇下有多啲嘅資訊可以可以發放嘅。

406
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,070
係。

407
01:33:49,590 --> 01:34:09,600
仲冇跟進，冇問題。最後一個係阿阿Po，阿阿，我想少少housekeeping啊，Catherine，噉我哋可以第三部分下一次先開，好唔好啊？誒，可以嘅，主席。因為咁咧，我哋可以問完阿Po，我哋大家可以完咗依依第二部分，好唔好？好，主席。誒，少少跟進翻乾才。

408
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:29,610
係啊，局長同埋秘書長答我啲答案嘅啫。就剛才啊，黃一文議員咧都問過關於嗰啲申請嘅時候咧，似乎就唔係太過真係誒所謂user-friendly，對於啲申請者唔係咁有幫助啦。包括好多誒應該有嘅表格或者提示都冇啦。咁呢方面我想理解下咧，就誒。

409
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:49,680
由於我哋第三部分將會處理關於嗰個檢控工作嘅困難，啊，特別係關於要證明到申請者咧要係明知而故犯呢一方面，咁當然我哋唔係話想要去懲罰一啲申請人，但係考慮咗如果個資源咧要能夠可以善用，對其他申請者特別嗰啲等咗好耐嘅公平。

410
01:34:49,680 --> 01:35:08,200
平啲咧，我哋都唔多唔少都要做多少少係喺嗰個執法上工作嚇。咁呢一方面，我想理解下咧，而家嗰個申請表咧上邊對於有關嘅申請者，佢哋係譬如話要誒未必需要宣誓，但係起碼都係一個叫做一個一個declaration啦，一個宣一個聲稱嚇。

411
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:15,540
誒嗰個有冇足夠嘅警告或者提示畀嗰啲申請者嘅？因為我未見過你個表格，局長。

412
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:35,830
嗱誒表格嘅資料嗰啲，我畀誒處方同事再補充。但係喺誒嗰個方向上嘅原則上咧，我哋同意係要檢討而家一啲嘅表格，確保我哋咧係有足夠嘅警示，咁變咗對我哋有檢控，即係針對嗰啲濫用或者係誒虛假申報咧，我哋喺檢控方面係更加係有效率啲嘅。

413
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:56,060
邊位答？黃女士，我請李生講講嗰個嗰個而家今天嗰個申請表有啲咩警示啊！好啊，唔該啊，李先生。誒喺個申請表上邊咧，大家咧可能留意到咧，就喺個四點四二嗰度咧都有好多誒關於呢個資料啊誒，講呢個填報呢個資產淨值嗰樣噉嘅嘢嘅。咁個裏邊嗰度亦都。

414
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:16,070
寫得好清楚咧，邊一啲就係要新一步，邊一啲咧就係誒，只係需要提交呢個證明文件嘅。至於頭先啊謝議員提拎提及到咧，就話我我哋有十七張呢一個誒叫做declaration form啦嚇，咁十七張declaration form裏邊都有一段咧，就已經係加咗上去，因為呢個審計處誒個報告話畀我哋聽咧，就係。

415
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:31,820
係話佢哋一定要knowing嚟知道呢個噉嘅element已經加咗嗰個噉嘅資料落去㗎啦嚇，做咗嘅。幾時加㗎？誒誒，審計處報告之後咧，跟住我哋即刻就加。幾好？而家咁多年嚟都冇做呢樣嘢嘅，係即係審計處出咗之後先至醒起要做。

416
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:53,580
主席，我諗我個係個情況就係話，其實喺個我哋同申請人溝通嗰陣，佢係知道咧。如果佢係即係虛假資料咧，其實會檢控嘅。不過就因應審計處處長嘅建議咧，我哋再即係將呢樣嘢再highlight翻出嚟喺每張form，我哋都再寫咗呢句就係：如果你提供一啲即係假嘅資料咧。

417
01:36:53,580 --> 01:37:13,590
係我哋有檢控嘅情況咁嚇，即係再做多一步嚇。阿Po主席，因為我即係括住呢個剛才啊黃女士嘅答案先啦，因為我同時想比較下咧，就係睇翻二點六三段咧，就誒，剛才啊韋文賢都提過㗎啦，有關於一啲嘅申請者咧，佢哋甚至乎即係有啲唔好彩咧，要去第。

418
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:22,780
三次第四次咧，先至即係接受佢。有啲成拖到成年，由開始最先入紙申請，到到真係有張藍表或者有個藍卡咧，都成年添嘅。

419
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:30,340
但係睇翻嗰度誒喺喺喺嗰個誒誒十一表嗰度咧，table eleven嗰度咧。

420
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:50,630
二點六三段嘅B啦嚇，咁咧就咧就係除咗一個個案之外咧，就從來都冇試過有電話上嘅接觸。咁剛才咧就誒局長都提過下㗎啦，即係話而家佢哋都都會可能會做多啲嘢。咁但係我想問嘅問題就係，你哋幾時選擇多啲人性化嘅接？

421
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,230
足即係電話嘅。

422
01:37:52,510 --> 01:38:12,520
幾時咧就純粹係一個官僚性用書面答咧？似乎一方面咧，你哋話誒喺嗰個誒有關於申請是否屬實、所作聲明是否屬實方面咧，你哋之前就完全冇諗過咧，用書面上一個警告或者要佢簽翻名，純粹話佢哋都知㗎啦，佢咁嗰個知係點樣得翻嚟咧？係咪由於你解釋都？

423
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:32,530
佢啲口頭上講咧，嗰啲應該係書面警告、書面簽名，你哋又唔做。但係應該人性化嗰啲咧，幫助佢申請嘅時候多啲提提醒佢，話你呢料唔夠喎，你唔好再表住啦，做咗呢啲先啦。嗰方面你哋又唔做，咁其實你哋係咪即係有啲嘢係本末倒置咗咧？王女士，係其實而家嗰個。

424
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:34,280
即係嗰個誒。

425
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:54,570
叫咩？隻新新報新報聲明啊！宣發宣證明佢係要簽名嘅嚇。至於我頭先所講咧，就係話因應審計處處長建議，我哋再大大隻啲字話畀佢聽。如果你虛報資料咧，就會點點點，即係再做多一步。以往有冇呢啲字嘅咧？唔係大唔大隻嘅問題。以往從來有冇試過有字面上嘅警告或者要佢簽嘅咧？我哋。

426
01:38:54,570 --> 01:39:14,580
我哋係有話畀佢聽嗱，第一不嬲都要簽名嘅，即係當佢做申報嗰陣，當然要簽名啦。咁亦都有提過喺個申請嗰度都有話畀佢聽，就係話你唔好亂咁報，即係唔好虛報資料啦。因為虛報資料，一來我哋有抽查呢個制度啦，虛報資料抽查到查到出嚟咧，係要去做檢控嘅。咁申請人係知道嘅。咁另外就係話。

427
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:34,590
誒點可以做得人性化啲咧？咁噉，因為我哋每一天係真係處每一日都處理緊好多嘅申請，咁所以我哋就冇可能咧，即係每一次第一下就即刻去打電話同嗰個申請人去溝通。咁所以我哋都會白紙黑字話畀佢聽，我退回你嘅申請又好，拒絕嘅申請又好，都會話翻個原因嘅，即係我哋有即係有封信嘅。

428
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:54,600
就話畀佢聽，你係唔符合咩條件，所以拒絕，或者咧你嗰個申請係漏咗某啲文件，直然叫直然剔畀佢睇嘅，即係漏咗兩樣啊、三樣啊噉。咁而家我哋就係話要做多一步，就係話如果連續兩次都係咁咧，我哋會主動打電話再同佢溝通嚇。咁因為呢個亦都係我哋自己本身嘅資源真係有限，我哋好難話。

429
01:39:54,600 --> 01:40:07,050
第一下咧就真係去打呢個電話做即係呢個步驟。噉我哋而家諗住做嘅咧就係連續兩次都仲有呢個情況出現咧，我哋會打電話再同佢溝通翻，就希望係一個改善嘅方法。多謝主席。

430
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:27,360
主席會唔會係誒？即係我明白，當然書面記錄嘅好處啦。即係如果你有封信咧，講埋個理由噉啊，點解唔做？但係一來一往嘅信咧，即係當然保障有餘，但係就溝通未必足嘅，因為好多時我哋就算好從法庭嘅文件處理都好咧，往往信來信往咧係記錄上可能好清晰，但係事實上咧係大家。

431
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:47,370
加路估估下咧，有時特別嗰啲對象，如果唔係話真係咁有誒，或者時間處理，或者唔係咁擅長處理文書工作嘅話咧，往往一個電話咧可以省卻對方咧，可能要痛苦幾日嘅時間，慢慢去解釋、瞭解呢封信啊，要要作封信畀你啊，要諸諸如此類。咁呢個其實唔係喺日喺資源運用上打個電話會快過。

432
01:40:47,370 --> 01:41:07,380
要走封信咧，或者對方更加辛苦添。係張係誒，我諗喺資源上面咧，打呢個電話其實唔係話你淨係講一句就可以收到呢個電話嘅。我哋都真係要，因為人性化啦，你有個電話嘅溝通，我哋都一定會啊要用時間去同呢個申請者誒講嘅。咁可能。

433
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:27,390
我講嘅嘢都係等於我上上面所講，佢就係漏咗唔知邊幾樣文件噉，咁所以我哋就話希望即係中間落墨少少，即係從我哋有限嘅資源裡面，同埋就係話誒點可以進一步令到個申請者會更加清楚，所以我哋而家個改善方法就係有一個少少中間落墨嘅。咁當然啦，即係如果你話我哋有。

434
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:47,400
多啲資源係咪可以做多啲咧？咁即係呢個永遠都係啱嘅嚇。但喺而家有限嘅資源，如果我哋希望將嗰個優次擺得好少少嘅時候咧，我哋嘅今天就有呢個噉樣嘅誒諗法，就希望從呢個方向去改善。

435
01:41:47,400 --> 01:42:04,330
You need to make sure that people are very accurately made aware of what is necessary for them to produce. The best way is have that in writing. Then there can be no dispute. If you have a telephone call, it can be more or less formal, but it needs to be recorded to be able to protect staff. So the bureaucracy grows.

436
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:24,630
所以，它適宜於我們使用書面形式，以便正確記錄他們需要做的。我們始終準備跟進，提醒他們，但必須基於書面形式中的信息。所以我不認為我們在電話會議中過度了。其實我問個問題，當時已經講咗呢個，即係你哋考慮嘅原因就係個記錄上嘅問題。

437
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:44,640
我問題個重心只係想話，係咪可以喺個平衡方面咧做得好啲，而唔係咧下下你淨係喺信後邊諗住交代咗啦，噉就又可以下一次B.U.時間有排等啦。正正因為而家我哋由朝到晚都講緊話，點樣能夠將成個制度妥善化咗佢，唔好嘥啲資源咁解啫。我我完全明白你個點，不過我希望你哋可以考慮。

438
01:42:44,640 --> 01:43:04,650
下喺個平衡方面做多啲工作咁解。另外最後咧，主席，我二點七三嗰度啦，關於嗰個之前我都可能問過少少，關於嗰個誒誒誒嗰個所謂random testing嗰度嚇，即係嗰個誒隨意式抽查嗰度。嗯，撇開我哋或者我自己之前講過咧，話應該試下咪將嗰個一百二十同埋一百八十嗰。

439
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:11,810
比例咧係響調一調咧，令到你哋可以係及早發覺多啲誒問題問題個案，可以早啲剔除之外咧。

440
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:32,110
我想了解下咧，誒，你哋而家誒用一個隨意嘅抽查，當然有個好處就係表面上好似好公平咁啦。咁但係如果講效率嚟講咧，如果係話一個懷疑有個案有問題先去查咧，嗰個噉嘅成效或者個成功率會唔會係更加高或者有效咧？

441
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:35,590
好嘅，阿黃女士啊。

442
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:56,340
誒，我諗其實嗱，因為嗰個抽查係有兩兩種抽查啦，即係一個就係開始係啦，另外就係去到嗰個配屋中就介處配屋階段嗰個啦。咁如果我哋真係有懷疑咧，其實理論上我哋喺開始嗰陣都唔需要去到一個抽查，即係啲三百宗抽查理論。

443
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:16,350
上我哋應該會做咗少少嘢㗎啦，即係譬如話去到配屋階段嗰陣時，其實我哋已經喺個過程咧都會睇到一啲嘢喺嗰度，亦都會處理到。咁用電腦隨機個好處咧，就係大家好公平嘅，就唔會有即係投訴啦。點解你要抽查我咧？點解唔抽查隔離嗰個咧？咁咁所以即係呢個呢方面，我哋都即係希望。

444
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:31,120
都要考慮。至於你話個比例三百係咪一定要將一百二十宗係新登記，誒一百八十宗就係配屋宗咧？咁呢個我哋都可以考慮睇，可唔可以即係適當地去做一啲嘅即係調配咯。approve，主席啊，唔該曬。

445
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:42,050
啊誒嗱，我哋誒今次咧就誒係做完第二第二第二學第二部分嘅，咁咧就誒我哋跟住咧就禮拜四。

446
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,330
誒三點半。

447
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:46,940
冇張圖啦。

448
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:53,900
啊！唔係唔係，我係講依個。今日兩點半係另外一個。我係禮拜四三點半咧。

449
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:59,890
老師對唔對？幾個喺度咁鳩？諗下先，兩點半啊！

450
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:05,250
係啊，冇錯啦。嗱，今今日三點半，今日四兩點半。

451
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:25,540
誒就跟住誒第三部分誒走誒，局長你走之前咧，我想你畀個答案我哋喺二點五一A嗰度咧，就係因為長策會有好多建議啦，誒審計處長都畀咗好多建議，噉我想想你有啲都即係同差不多一樣咁上下嘅，噉我想你畀個時間表我。

452
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:32,610
我哋等我哋喺報告嗰度可以落實佢，係幾時會做呢啲建議，係幾時跟進啊？好嘛？

453
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:36,220
誒主席，正如我剛才都解釋咧，就係。

454
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,400
啊！

455
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:57,750
有審計處報告提出嚟建議啊，今次誒處長都係認為係同意嘅，亦都有跟進啊。咁呢啲我就會去防委會㗎啦。我正話只係再補充就話，由於而家都進行緊一個公眾諮詢，關於長遠房策略，而喺個策略裏邊亦都提及一啲喺誒點樣有效運用。

456
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:17,760
公資源噉，所以嗰啲意見咧，啲一評加埋畀房委會咁解啫。因為審計處嘅建議咧，就你哋可以盡快去做，因為點解咧？依個都係誒資源嘅分配，噉係我哋唔想咧，即係喺依度嚟誒誒，你哋話做而係冇一個時間去做，我哋要跟住，因為我哋唔係就噉話寫完個報告，你知道我仲有好多clearing。

457
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:26,450
heat喺度㗎，我哋會跟進，所以我就要你畀個時間表我哋，係幾時會做，誒誒，即係審計署嗰啲報啊。

458
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:32,480
我諗對於所有審計處報告提出建議，我哋都會交畀房委會去進一步跟進。

459
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:38,020
誒，有關於嗰個誒計分制，你係接受咗啲意見㗎啦嘛？

460
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:58,460
咁但係喺決策過程裏邊，要房委會去作決策。誒，依個唔係我嘅問題，即係你接受，即係你你依個。我哋覺得係可以做，但係問題就係具體點樣做咧？譬如你話我哋檢討個計分制係檢討邊幾方面？係咪你畀個時間畀我哋點去做好嘛？啊啊，因為我要寫翻報告嗰度。誒，主席，我相信如果係我哋要具體點樣做？

461
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:18,470
做咧就要開個房委會啲會嘅嚇，就變咗唔係好短期可以嚇。有啲可以短期做，你咪分翻邊啲可以短期做，邊啲唔可以短期做。短期做邊啲？因為我哋寫報告嗰陣時，因為我跟進依個誒六一號報告嗰度咧，我要咁去做，所以我希望誒你喺度，唔係咧。

462
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:24,230
誒令到我哋好難寫個報告咧，噉就大家嚇難做啲啦，好冇？

463
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:26,730
唔該。

464
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:34,980
三三點半，我係繼續另外一個chapter one。

465
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,800
得個咩？

466
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:38,730
嗯。
