00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
夠鍾又夠人啦，嚇！

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,020
各位出席好勤力，唔使驚留會啊！

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,630
今日議程有兩份文件要討論。

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:20,650
其中一項議程咧，e c二零一三一四二十係喺一月十五日上次會議咧未能審議，而要順延到今日嘅。

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:29,420
噉啊，當局喺會前提交ECI二零一三一四嘅誒十三號資料文件。

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,090
誒，畀各委員參與。

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:47,220
該文件再列，是從二零零二年以來獲批准嘅首長級編制變動嘅資料，以及兩個討論項目所在編動變動對首長級編制嘅影響嘅。

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:01:06,430
誒，我提醒各位委員，如果嗰委員就今日討論嘅事項有直接或間接金錢利益咧，就請按議事規則第八十三A嘅規定，喺就該事宜發言之前披露有關利益嘅成績。

9
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:15,990
誒，我亦提醒委員注意咧，議事規則第八十四條有關喺直接金錢利益嘅情況下表決嘅規定。

10
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,230
噉就誒。

11
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:34,480
房屋署就建議喺四月一號開始咧，開設一個首長級丙級政務官偏外職位，首長級新起新點第二點啦。

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:45,270
為為期兩年，而應付因推行長遠房屋策略檢討所提出嘅建議而衍生及增加嘅工作量嘅。

13
00:01:46,770 --> 00:02:01,560
噉啊！呢份文件咧，EC二零一三一四二十咧，啊，當局咧曾經喺十月二號，舊年十月二號同今年一月六號就呢項建議諮詢立法會房屋事務委員會。

14
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,090
噉啊！出席回答各位議員問題嘅咧，係有啊。

15
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,500
運房局上任秘書長，誒房屋柏志高先生。

16
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,040
運房局首席秘書長、房屋政策統籌鄧志良先生。

17
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,970
咁由於房房屋事務委員會主席黃國興議員唔係本小組委員。

18
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:36,740
嘅，亦都唔能夠出席今日會議咧。我會根據委員會秘書已備嘅資料咧，簡單陳述委員會嘅討論要點。

19
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:51,320
咁房屋事務委員會咧，就喺舊年嘅十月二號同今年一月六號都討論過有關建議。委員不反對當局將建議交畀人事編制小組委員考慮。

20
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:12,450
有關委員關注長遠房屋策略督導會尚未向政府提交報告，喺仍然未知最終未來路向嘅嘅情況下咧，現階段開設職位以因以應付因推行長遠房屋策略所引致嘅工作。

21
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,830
作咧，誒有啲委員咧，部分委員咧認為可能延遲過早。

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:31,500
喺一月六日嘅會議咧，委員要求當局提供補充資料，具體説明建議開設嘅首長級、丙級政務官職位上將負責嘅職務。

23
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:49,730
當局承諾喺人事編制委員會會議前提供一個一覽表，列出喺督導委員會發表諮詢文件所提嘅各項事項咧，邊啲係公眾期望房屋處加以處理，以及建議開設嘅偏愛首長。

24
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:56,220
級丙級政府官職位喺進行相關政策檢討時，需要處理嘅。

25
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:09,360
當局所提供嘅籍資料文件已經係一月十四號，隨住立法會C B一七二四足一三一四零一號文件發送畀各位委員參員。

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,920
嚇！而家提問嘅議員咧係有兩位嘅，黃國健議員同郭家麒議員，每人五分鐘。

27
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,470
黃議員，係多謝主席。

28
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:40,760
誒，首先申報一下先，主席，我係誒房屋委員會嘅委員啊。雖然冇金錢利益，但係都都要申報一下。噉就誒，我係支持房署呢個誒開位嘅建議，因為都知道咧係誒，除咗長策會嘅誒一啲嘅。

29
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,360
建議需要房誒房署跟進之外咧，其實誒喺新一屆政府對公屋嘅誒。

30
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:10,800
誒措施咧係有好多誒新嘅要求啦，亦都係社會對公屋嘅建設咧係亦都有誒好急切嘅需求。噉嘅情況之下咧，我相信房署嘅人手咧係有需要增強嘅。不過咧就係誒，我都希望誒政府。

31
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:30,810
咧係能唔能夠比較清晰咁講一講咧？呢個新嘅職位嗰個具體嘅誒職能範圍啊，噉樣畀大家誒增加瞭解一下。係嗯，秘書長，嚇你回答。Thank you，Madam Chairman。In fact, we did issue, as you said, a note on the。

32
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:50,820
Thirteenth of January, setting out in some detail the issues that will have to be addressed. Put broadly, there are some issues that have already, for example, been accepted by the government in respect of the increase in production targets: four hundred and seventy thousand, two hundred and eighty thousand for the public sector.

33
00:05:50,820 --> 00:06:10,830
There are some issues which we will have to address through the housing authority. That is the review of quota and points system, the well of tenant program. Those. How do we deal with inadequately housed households? Issues relating to licensing of landlord and tenant ordinance, which are not currently existing policy, but will have to be taken.

34
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:30,840
On, as a consequence of the discussion that's already taken place during the consultation on the long-term housing strategy, we also have to look at a framework for the further policy review of the long-term housing strategy. Because of course, this is not a one-off exercise. The

35
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:38,140
recommendation from the long-term housing strategy steering committee is that, for example, the

36
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:48,230
housing demand figures should be reviewed on an annual basis to make sure that the programme of supply is kept up to date. So we need to do that on an ongoing basis.

37
00:06:48,510 --> 00:07:08,520
Going beyond that, we also need to look at how other housing delivery agencies, such as the housing society and the urban renewal authority, can be more engaged in the production of housing, particularly on the public public housing side. And of course, how the private sector might be able to contribute not just to private housing but

38
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:17,710
perhaps also public housing in a form of home ownership scheme of some form, so those are some of the other issues. Beyond that, of course.

39
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:30,760
There needs to be proper coordination on all of this work within both the housing department and between the housing department and other government departments, because, for example, land supply in respect of

40
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:49,350
the the housing requirements will require input from many different departments, lands development planning department and development bureau. We need a focus within the housing department to ensure that all of these issues are given appropriate level of attention, and this will be done through this particular postman, gentlemen. Thank you.

41
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:12,970
誒冇冇冇冇跟進啊！主席啊，冇國家企業主席誒。我成日都講啦，即係如果你係話加咗個人嘅話，又可以順應到市民嘅要求咧，我哋冇可能唔畀。問題就係長策會咧出咗嗰個文件啦，亦都最後咧第一輪個。

42
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:27,530
諮詢完咗之後咧，局長咧行咗出嚟啦，差唔多啲嘢都冇變嘅，即係話長遠房屋嗰個誒承諾嗰個承建量咧都係四十七萬，公營私營嗰個比例又唔變，咩都唔變。

43
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,530
噉我哋咧當然有好大嘅失望啦，呢個第一。

44
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,990
第二咧就係，雖然呢個新政府上嚟咧，房屋就成係重中之重。

45
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:52,970
但係公屋嗰個所謂增加個量咧，都係幾千個單位；居屋咧就繼續咧係畫餅充飢。我唔知秘書長點點樣譯畀佢，即係中國人講嗰啲話畀你聽，好多年後先至有嘢畀你，而家又餓死嘅。

46
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,500
而家你攞呢個位有冇方法喺呢個委員會講清楚？

47
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,680
一啲重要嘅。

48
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:08,970
譬如話指標啦，增提前咗嗰個建屋量，又或者增加嗰個無論係公屋或者居屋。

49
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:19,360
嗰個建成嗰個量咧，喺呢一任啊！我強調係呢一任政府，你而家攞呢個位咧，係一個嗯編內嘅職位，有個限期嘅。

50
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,340
噉你做嘢都有個譜㗎，即係畀個位你，譬如你話兩年，噉你兩年內交到㗎，係咪可以增加到個房屋？

51
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,170
因為而家房屋個量，因為而家咧好多，大家都知道二十幾萬個輪候冊入邊。

52
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,490
唔計嗰啲單身後生仔，有好多係實際需要嗰啲，嗰十超過十一萬嗰啲咧。

53
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:55,670
家庭而為本嗰啲咧，到你呢個任政府落任咧，都係冇行嘅。甚至下一個五年咧，去到尾先至得嘅，即係呢樣嘢就好難去接受嘅。唔係個位嘅問題，而係有啲乜嘢係好具體加咗呢個位，佢係可以交到貨，主席。

54
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,330
好被取消啦，Madam Chairman，In fact，the whole department.

55
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:21,790
是 dedicatet to producing additional units. and in fact, again, we have been able to advance some production already into the first five years. We're already working on the second five years. So you know, the existing commitment, leaving aside any additional commitment, is already one hundred and seventy nine thousand. That's already land secured.

56
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:35,480
所以，what we're now looking at is how do we extend that existing commitment in terms of production of public housing—that's public rental housing—up to the next challenge, which is roughly 280,000, as announced by the chief executive.

57
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:55,770
Plus, we also have to increase the home ownership scheme production. It's not just about public rental housing. It's about home ownership scheme as well. And that, as you know, the decision has been taken to increase that from the initial block group of seventeen thousand to a recurrent requirement of eight thousand per annum in the second five-year period. That

58
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:15,780
那生產，那challenge是是某樣嘢，我哋已經喺度做緊，我會返嚟同成員們去尋求額外嘅技術職位，去幫我哋做呢個。呢個職位係處理政策方面嘅，係處理譬如點樣確保優質住户得到妥善處理，因為當然。

59
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:35,790
If we can take back units from well-off tenants, they are then available for allocation to people on the waiting list. How do we deal with abuse of existing public rental housing? Again, if we can remove abusers, we can take those units back. They can also add to the number that can be allocated to people on the waiting list.

60
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:55,800
Beyond that, of course, as I said in my supplementary note, there are issues relating to subdivided units that we need to look at. For example, during the consultation period, there were many comments about rent control, about security of tenure. These are not things that we've been dealing with in the past, as members are well aware.

61
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:06,140
There is no rent control in Hong Kong, so if we're to look at those in a comprehensive basis, I need the resources to allow us to do that. Beyond that.

62
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,760
你係問緊關於，呢個特別的崗位係如何貢獻到生產額外的居屋？

63
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:27,710
作為我説過在我的上一輪回答，我們需要確保所有部門都聚焦於這個政府給出的優先事項。現在，我沒有懷疑發展局、土地局、規劃局和其他部門都在盡力而為。

64
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:48,150
但， there are always issues and and I'm sure members are well aware of this. When we get a particular plot of land, we have to go through a rezoning often. We have to go through district council consultation often. We have to look at issues relating to infrastructure, drainage, sewerage, electricity, etc. All of that needs to be

65
00:12:48,150 --> 00:13:03,260
properly coordinated. Now, this post will help me to do that because the the other posts that I'll be seeking separately are dealing with the technical things. They're dealing with you know how big, how the plot ratio and what have you. This is a more general approach required to deal with the policy issues.

66
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:23,550
主席，我問得好清楚，我唔知阿柏志高先生咧就即係答唔到嘅。如果我聽佢噉啊答咧，即係話呢一任政府咧都係可以交到貨，都係零嘅啫，即係繼續係畫餅充飢，即係話將來啦，將來你畀個位我，將來畀多啲屋，我係咪想確定呢一個答案？過咗時間，你下一次問啦，好冇？

67
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,230
因為有下面有幾個人排緊隊，唔好意思，湯少平議員。誒，多謝主席。

68
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,670
就。

69
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:50,990
即係睇翻咧，你啲資料咧就誒，我唔知道啊啊處方知唔知咧？早前咧，其實都有房屋處公會請願咧，就對嗰個即係首長級個內部升遷，即係尤其是個副處長位咧冇咧，佢哋都嚟過即係政府總部請願，我哋都見過下佢哋。咁當然同呢個。

70
00:13:50,990 --> 00:14:11,000
個位有冇相關咧？我唔知啦。咁但係睇翻你資料咧，其實你哋誒響零三年嗰陣時，一萬二千幾個編制咧，一路即係兩處誒局處合並之後咧，得翻九千幾個，即係少咗三千幾人。噉就我其實主要想問翻咧，就係誒你誒其實文件裡面有講咧就。

71
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,300
誒。

72
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:32,700
你哋誒響呢個一四年三月咧，就會解散嗰個而家現有嗰個誒所謂支援嗰個誒部咧，就嗰七個職位啊，係嘛？噉就會響之後咧，會建議咧，就有一個特別誒職務組咧，就會開設翻八個非首長。

73
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:52,950
級嘅職位就我主要想了解下咧誒，其實誒呢個誒人手嗰個編制之內咧，其實會唔會仲有其他嘅增加咧？因為事實上誒房屋嗰個供應咧一路會增加咧，噉啊管理上咧喺理論上嘅人會增加嘅。咁呢度我想了解下唔該嚇，李書長。

74
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:12,960
Madam Chair, yes, I am very well aware of the the staffing issue. Of course, that's not related to this post at all. It's dealing with an existing post, and the the situation there is, in fact, we are in discussion with the staff. We have been actually for a couple of years with the staff association because this is not something that

75
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:33,200
Was unexpected. This is something that unfortunately arises because of the the system we have to promote to an open directorate. So that we are already dealing with. I'm I'm happy to talk about that perhaps separately. In so far as the this post is concerned, yes, of course the work in terms.

76
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,550
的。

77
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:55,440
preparation of the long-term housing strategy and the consultation exercise that it completes as soon as we the steering committee submits its report, but the work that is now needed is to implement the recommendations that are set out in the steering committee's report and that's what this post is about. You ask about well.

78
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:05,780
Whether we'll be looking for additional posts beyond the posts that were set out in this paper, not for this purpose. But I can say, and I've said this before, we will be looking for additional posts.

79
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:26,070
to help us to meet the targets on production, those are technical posts, engineers, architects, surveyors and what have you. And those posts, we are seeking additional posts. We will have to do so as the the production targets increase. And as I said earlier in reply to an earlier question, the the numbers will.

80
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:36,170
增加，作為 consequence of of the long term housing strategy steering committee's review exercise， and that's what we will be working. But that again is a separate submission.

81
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,230
thank you.

82
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,220
係，噉啊，跟住就係梁繼昌議員。

83
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,790
誒多謝主席，我申報翻，我係啱啱退任嘅房委會委員。

84
00:16:50,070 --> 00:17:10,080
咁據我所知咧，嗱，長遠房屋策略督導委員會開會嘅時候咧，其實誒房署咧就有個秘書處去提供好多支援嘅服務啦。咁而家咧，咁呢個秘書處咧，其實就已經解散咗啦。咁即係第七段文件第七段講咧，有七個職位，同埋咧亦都有一個誒助。

85
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:30,090
助理秘書長誒，首席助理秘書長兼任統領呢個秘書處嘅。噉我亦都明白到咧，誒，長策會開會嘅時候亦都即係誒，署方提供咗好多文件啊、支援等等。咁但係咧，我我我對呢個位咧，其實持開放態度。但係我想署方咧，要要遊説我。

86
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:50,100
點解要開多一個首長級嘅職位？因為其實嗱，你睇翻房委會本身個功能同埋職能咧，其實長策會入邊所講嘅嘢咧，其實咧係理應都可以喺房委會度各個誒小組度討論嘅呢啲長遠房屋策略，亦都係。

87
00:17:50,100 --> 00:18:03,400
房委會既有功能，不過咧，當然呢個政府好中意開好多委員會，亦都好中意僭建，咁將呢一啲嘢可能聚焦啲，亦都係加快咗速度，係去做咗呢啲噉嘅長遠房屋策略出嚟。

88
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:23,690
嗱咁嗰個策略或者嗰啲建議係睇曬度啦，但係落實嗰方面當然也要有個時間表啦。亦都啊，我又唔覺得你你啊啊，頭先處長講咗話啊，呢一個位就唔係話做技術性嘅嘢嘅啊，只不過咧係誒誒去去睇睇究竟係點樣去落實啊，等等一個。

89
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:34,370
方向性係或者政策上嘅嘢，嗱，既然咧，你第七段嗰度已經有一位即係首席助理秘書長，就本來都係誒。

90
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:54,660
啊，支援緊嗰個長遠房屋即係長策會啦。咁但係第八段你又講話，因為咧佢而家咧就好繁忙，即係唔可以兼顧啦。噉啊，所以又要即係繼續咧就增加一個D two嘅嗱偏外職位。但係我就唔係太明點解要有一個需要咧去。

91
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:14,670
增加，因為其實即係我頭先講過啦。長策會所有嘅建議，其實咧都可以。如果冇咗長策會，都可以喺房委會入邊嘅小組傾到嘅呢啲噉嘅誒建議同埋措施。咁當然啦，即係而家你話啊，因為誒誒有有扎建。

92
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:34,680
建議出嚟又要落實，但係你第一落實係冇一個好清楚嘅時間表，亦都我都睇唔到點解要有另外一位嘅誒首長級嘅同事咧要去統籌呢樣嘢，因為其實而家咁多個誒處長啊、助理處長等等，我覺得係係即係你要話到點解會多多咗嘢做，同埋點解？

93
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,760
唔可以繼續由呢個啊首席助理秘書長兼任呢樣嘢咧嚇，唔該。

94
00:19:41,300 --> 00:20:01,310
非常。Thank you, Madam Chairman. A couple of things. The housing authority is actually only a very small part of the total set of recommendations that's come out of the long-term housing strategy. Really, it breaks down to review of the quota and point system, review of well-off tenants, review of the abuse of tenancies. It's those.

95
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:09,660
Specifically, housing department/housing authority issues that we will take take forward through the normal housing authority mechanisms.

96
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,510
但你 still have to have the input.

97
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,040
to get.

98
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,890
The papers, the recommendations and the discussion going in the housing authority. So that work still has to continue.

99
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:40,240
This post is dealing with the wider issues that are outside the housing authority. I'm not asking for any posts for the housing authority. This is in a sense the bureau side of the work and not the department side of the work. As you're aware, we we amalgamated those and as a consequence, I I have a sort of two hat situation. On the one hand, I'm trying to deal with.

100
00:20:40,240 --> 00:21:00,250
housing authority。 on the other hand, I'm trying to deal with housing policy. This, as I've said before, is housing policy, and it deals with the wider issues which are not under the housing authority per se. Subdivided units, inadequately housed households. That's not a housing authority thing, particularly if you want to regulate, if you want to license, if you want to put in place rent control, if you want to put

101
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:09,060
In place tenancy protection. These are not things that the housing authority can deal with. The other side of the coin is again, as we set out in our supplementary note.

102
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:29,520
We have to deal with the other departments and the other agencies again. Housing societies are big agency in terms of housing production. How do they fit into the new parameters that we're trying to drive for the additional production? The urban renewal authority again, it's not housing authority. That is part of the wider context that we're looking at.

103
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,460
and again.

104
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:50,860
We in the past used to draw on the resources of the private sector, private sector participation scheme. That was dropped in two thousand two. Is that something we should be looking at again? These are the policy areas that this sort of post needs to take on. If I can just take two more minutes, the other thing that I need to comment on is that.

105
00:21:50,860 --> 00:22:04,640
When we're looking at actual production, or management or maintenance, that's of course the housing authority housing department function. But these policy issues don't fall into that area, and that's why we need the additional post.

106
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,940
誒跟住中國賓院，多謝主席。誒，即係長策會而家咧就誒計劃先。

107
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:33,230
十年之內就起大概四十八萬個住屋單位，咁即係我係相信，即係唔會揷揷下每年係四萬八噉啊。噉我想問問啊，秘書長咧，嗰個時間表咧係幾時開始會係個高峯期嗰啲住宅落成嘅時間，同埋即係而家大家知道嗰個建築工人嗰個短。

108
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:42,390
決情況咁嚴重，即係有咩可能，或者咩情況，即係真係可以做得到？誒，完成得到呢呢個噉嘅數字咧？

109
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,210
被輸走。

110
00:22:45,640 --> 00:23:05,650
Thank you. The honourable member is absolutely right. We don't have a flat line of production of the same number every year. Every year depends on the land supply. When we get the land, when it's ready for for the construction process to take place, it depends on the resources. And we're trying internally to get the resources. But again, the honourable member is quite right.

111
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,960
Construction industry as a whole has a very tight situation on manpower, so

112
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:25,730
We are already starting to gear up to increase the production, and as I answered earlier, we're already working towards even now before any change, a regular 20,000 per annum.

113
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:46,020
just on the public housing, rental housing side, we are also already working on 5,000 per annum homeownership scheme. So that's 25,000 that we'll be trying to work towards in the second five-year period. That's sort of starting from 2020 onwards. But we need to increase that further, and that's one of the the big challenges.

114
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:59,500
我唔知，因為我唔知。

115
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:19,790
given the five year five to six year lead time, then I will be starting to ramp up production by about two thousand and twenty three, twenty four onwards. But I honestly haven't got that information just yet, and this is one of the reasons this post becomes very important because we need to work with the other departments to secure that additional land. On the question of

116
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:39,800
manpower， again we've been working quite closely with the construction industry council, development bureau to look at training, to try and encourage more people to join the industry. and I believe development bureau has has briefed the development panel on their initiatives in this area. so

117
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:59,810
Perhaps I won't go into too much detail on that, but I will say, as far as the department is concerned, we over the last two years have been looking to increase our manpower. We've been able to increase technical staff—that's site staff, engineers, surveyors and what have you—by about 300 posts.

118
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:10,990
We will continue to to look at that requirement, so that within the department we have the capability to produce that number, and then in terms of the.

119
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:25,120
Private contractors that help us to actually do the building side. We're also working with those contractors to try and make sure they have the resources. But I'll be honest with you, it is going to be very tough because of this additional production that we have to we have to produce.

120
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:45,940
噉，主席，我想問問秘書長，即係佢正話都講誒，未來一兩年都要睇睇嗰個土地供應嗰個實際情況係點。咁即係咪即係未來嗰一兩年嗰四萬八理論上係做唔到，同埋即係會即係累積咗落去，可能第四、第五年嗰陣時先陸陸續續出現。咁嗰陣時可能一年就。

121
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:52,120
唔係四萬八，可能就變咗，可能一年有六七萬嘅供應都唔頂喎。會唔會係噉樣嘅分析啊？

122
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,060
Madam Chairman, let me perhaps make it clear.

123
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,480
the the forty four hundred and seventy thousand total over ten years.

124
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,990
comprises both public and private.

125
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:11,780
As far as the public sector is concerned, the the target is actually about two hundred and eighty thousand over that ten year period.

126
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:21,150
我們已經建179,000，所以，的additional，that we need to produce is about 100,000，some between 80 and 100,000。

127
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,600
那 comprises both public rental and home ownership scheme.

128
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:33,990
The production lead time, the time it takes from getting a piece of land to completing the building, is depends on.

129
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:47,830
rezoning and what have you, but we're we're trying to reduce it to about five years. So I can say absolutely, the current five-year target is already set. There's almost nothing I can do. I may be able to bring a few into the the fifth year.

130
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,870
所以，what we're now looking at is the second five-year target.

131
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,190
and that's where the additional will have to come in.

132
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:16,590
Talking of the private sector, which is obviously somewhat different, the government's commitment for the private sector is to produce 20,000 sufficient land for the private sector to produce 20,000 units on average during the during an annual basis, and that target is something that Development Bureau is looking.

133
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,230
and we are working with them to make sure that.

134
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,040
When we when you have whole land supply, we have the right proportion.

135
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:37,380
60% for public housing and 40% for private housing, as recommended by the steering committee. So yes, it's the second five-year period where the additional land needs to be produced and the additional public housing has to be built.

136
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,800
嗯。

137
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,290
嗯，到我啦，秘書長。

138
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,780
噉啊，就你呢個建屋計劃，你都解解釋咗好多啦。咁但

139
00:27:47,060 --> 00:28:07,070
我知你文件都話你會開多嚇八個誒非首長級嘅有時限嘅職位啦嚇，但即係我見到好多房屋處人員非首長級咧，都係表示即係個工作量增加得好緊要，同埋係有個好嚴謹嘅時間表啦。因為佢哋覺得個工作量。

140
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:27,080
好大，好辛苦啊！即係喺非首長級好多範疇都唔夠人手噉。你可唔可以講清楚啲？你呢係開啲乜嘢非首長級嘅職位，同埋你睇到邊方面最吃重啊？其實地政署嘅即係唔係你呢度咧，即係負責收地發展嗰啲咧，都有同樣嘅，即係。

141
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,180
係表示係人手不足，噉啊，房屋署嚟講咧，你可唔可以講講？

142
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,250
非首長級點處理？

143
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:57,860
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Yes, I think the posts that we're talking about here are related to this policy exercise, but we have a much bigger programme of post creation in terms of our production, and that's for the construction and development section, and for our maintenance and management sections. The last, as I said, the last.

144
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:17,870
couple of years, we've managed to create around 300 posts, extra posts in that in those two areas. The the majority, probably 90%, have been on the construction side. We're also looking to create additional posts this year through the RAE process, and I can I can anticipate having to create further posts in in further

145
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,700
following years as well. This

146
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:26,070
但係，what we've done is we've consciously looked at the flow of our construction programme. so

147
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:46,360
Clearly, what we need in the first phase are people who are dealing with planning, who are dealing with that sort of initial work. The second phase, which is where we are now, is the substructure. That's the geotechnical works. It's foundation works. We're now getting into the superstructure works, and that's where the next tranche of staff will have to be.

148
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:57,000
Sort and then beyond that we go into maintenance and management. So we've taken a conscious decision that while we know what the total number should be, we should do it on a phased basis because obviously we don't want people

149
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,370
In post that are not actually yet needed for that particular function, obviously.

150
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:23,660
We now need to look at that again because of the new targets that we've been given as a result of the long-term housing strategy steering committee exercise. So we will be doing that. We'll be working with civil service bureau, financial services and the treasury bureau to look at what the additional resources are. But I can say that the staff have been magnificent. They've taken

151
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:40,010
Taken on additional work, they are under huge pressure. I have to say, because of the need to deliver these additional units, and they understand, but they can't be expected to just continue to take on this work without some relief. And it's the relief that we're trying to work on at the moment.

152
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:52,620
我想問秘書長，你開咁多個職位啦，非首長級啦，多係誒幾多？大概幾多會係較高層升級嘅職位？幾多係入職嘅職位？

153
00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:12,910
同埋入職嘅職位嚟講，我哋個專上學院係培培訓夠你需要嘅技術啊，各樣嘅人才。嗯，Madam Chairman，Yes，in fact，almost all of the posts that we're talking about are professional，semi-professional posts，so they they they need to be for for the purposes for

154
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:32,920
example of working on our building sites, they need to be trade tested. They need to have the skill set to be able to work on those sites. We do have an apprenticeship arrangement within the department where we can bring people in and train them up ourselves. So we will be dealing with that as well. I'm not offhand. I honestly don't have the proportion between senior staff and junior staff, but I can.

155
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,990
我可以説，作為作為監察部的職員，過去兩年我們只創辦了，我認為。

156
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:59,280
五 directorate posts and we'll be and we're seeking another three this year. The rest are professional grade, senior professional grade staff. In terms of training, as I said earlier in reply to an earlier question, we are also working with the Construction Industry Council and the tertiary institutions to try and ensure that we do have people of the

157
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:06,930
Right calibre, but I'll be honest. I'm having to poach people from the private sector, from other government departments, and I'm not very popular because of that.

158
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,200
嗯，咁跟住第二輪提問咧，國家旗議員。

159
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,810
主席，即係嗱，我我都。

160
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:26,800
叫幫下政府啦，我都畀曬位你去去講㗎啦。因為如果真正睇你個文件嗰度咧，主席第十段十一段講呢個編內職務嘅職責咧。

161
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,610
第十段講咧就話佢係需要做一啲評估啦，十一段就係諮詢期入邊嗰啲嘢，其實全部口水嘢嚟嘅，主席。

162
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:41,190
噉啊，局長就已經回應咗㗎啦。第一階段就係乜嘢都唔變。

163
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,480
噉我亦都想開個位，都有啲實際嘢去做啦。

164
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,300
咁如果你話講翻嗰啲劏房嗰啲，一講咗出嚟咧～

165
00:32:50,820 --> 00:33:03,250
就真係不但止冇幫到個問題，仲衰啲添。因為大部分住劏房嗰啲咧等緊上樓嘅，噉你樓啊唔加畀佢，你真係管佢，噉啊即係趕佢瞓街嘅啫。

166
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,810
租管。

167
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:25,100
你冇冇呃我哋啦？你都係喺度即係噏嘅啫。咁所以其實最重要嘅問題就係話點樣去令到呢一啲住喺劏房啊，你好關心佢哋，咁令到佢哋有得提早上樓。第二你就話點樣可以誒，又使多啲人嚇即係喺住喺公屋放出嚟，其實。

168
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:45,110
大家都知道嗰個房屋階梯就係，如果你有一啲居屋噉就可以有機會咧，係有市一啲咧，係住緊公屋嗰啲，尤其係佢個有入息係到嘅噉啊，轉買呢個居屋啦，噉啊留嗰啲位出嚟，噉啊多啲人上樓啦。噉你而家兩樣都係交白卷嘅，即係起碼我問嚟問去。

169
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:57,700
另外呢一任你係咪交白卷？你話係交白卷嘅噉樣，咁要個位嚟真係嘥氣嘅啦，主席。噉啊，不如冇開啦，因為佢講咧最重要咧就唔係佢哋呢個部門嘅，最重要咧就發展局去揾地。

170
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:07,770
噉啊！呢個位交畀發展局揾多啲地，噉啊會唔會仲好啲咧？即係幫長遠嚟講，幫到香港人多過畀呢個特別職務啦，都係口水嘢嚟嘅嚇。

171
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,650
啊，秘書上。

172
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,350
先生。

173
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:30,170
You're quite right. This is not a technical post; it's a policy post. As I said, we're dealing with the technical posts separately, and we'll be coming back on those posts. As far as helping tenants in subdivided units, I've said this many times. I'm sure the honourable members heard me. The best solution is to produce more units.

174
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:50,460
Absolutely, and that's where our priority must lie. Anything else, be it rent control, be it tenancy protection and stuff, that still does not help us unless we have in place some sort of regulation and licensing to improve the condition in subdivided units. And that's exactly what the steering committee has asked.

175
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,240
has recommended, and it's something that we need to look at. How can we not not just

176
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:16,690
Do the solution, which is to build more, but in the interim, do something to help those people who are living in SDUs. And clearly, you have to have a look at licensing and all the things that come with that. And this is why this post is so important because it's a new area. It's not something that's done at the moment, and there are many different ways that you could look at it. Some of which have been covered in the.

177
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:27,910
Steering committee's consultation document, but some have come out of the consultation process. We need to look at that. The other thing, of course, is that in terms of

178
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:43,280
encouraging our existing tenants to move out. You're absolutely right. If we can encourage people to move out, be it to buy home ownership scheme units and give them a way out, recreate the ladder, that then does free up units for people to come in off the waiting list.

179
00:35:43,690 --> 00:36:03,700
But we need to build those HOS units because at the moment we don't have any HOS units that are vacant. So we've got to get on with the building side to be able to provide that route out. So it's a very complex web of different issues that we have to address. And of course, you're absolutely right again. Development bureau is very important in terms of the land, but if they produce the

180
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:21,870
我們不建喺上，係個無謂嘅嘗試。我們需要能夠建喺嗰塊地，需要能夠得到區議會嘅支持，需要得到重新規劃同埋其他嘅行動。所以我哋恐怕唔係一個簡單嘅問題，係一項行動，係一係列嘅行動，必須要採取嚟應對問題。

181
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,890
誒第一輪提問啊，梁國雄議員五分鐘啊，主席，即係我哋好為難，呢個係政治嘅問題嚟㗎嘛。

182
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,100
我講真。

183
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,670
即係喺梁振英上台冇幾耐咧，林鄭月娥同埋啊。

184
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,410
呢個。

185
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:48,080
即係誒政務司司長啊，就話呢啲劏房咧要解決，噉就會改啲。

186
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:56,820
誒供下或者嗰啲樓宇咧，整一萬個嗰啲好啲嘅房出嚟噉樣，咁隔咗一年之後又話做唔到嘅。

187
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,350
即係發展局就話：喂，唔得㗎喎，成本太重喎，法例有問題。

188
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,850
當日你哋話，如果你當日嚟話，喂，畀錢我做啲嘢啊，我哋都畀你㗎。

189
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,230
而家做唔到啊嘛！

190
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,850
呢個唔係第一次㗎嘛。

191
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,210
一排坐開，話畀全香港人聽。我叫梁振英，我叫咗人做嘢㗎啦。我睇到呢個問題。

192
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:27,400
我都因為我老實講，阿主席，我冇你咁勤力嘅。我我係選擇性記憶嘅啫，我就記憶到咧，佢就做唔到。

193
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,630
噉我又唔記得咗，我哋有冇批錢畀佢做啦？即係話，喂，呢個好龐大嘅工程嚟嘅喎，嗱。

194
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,830
呢個政治問題嚟㗎嘛，個特首講嘅嘢做唔到，跟住。

195
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,840
即係。

196
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,310
即係知唔知啊？即係求其噉樣，好似我哋。

197
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:55,270
去醫院探病噉，唉唔好兩手空空啊！買蔬超上去啊，買個幾個橙上去送畀人哋。唉，我你你我探病噉樣，你個政府咁做嘢點做啊，大佬？

198
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,380
而家上嚟又話：哦，原來梁振英任內咧啲嘢改唔到嘅。

199
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,570
其實係後邊啲嘢嚟嘅。

200
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,500
前面嗰啲係當自己做，後邊嗰啲又唔使做。

201
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,870
老實講，呢個係正事。

202
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:17,180
就係話你一定有我十年之內有我，否則咧就冇得成先計後，咪嘥時間。我就我一啲唔會怪你哋。

203
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:37,680
你話嗰個誒private sector，即係嗰個私，即係啲誒發展商，你點逼到佢做啊？董建華佢話八萬，咁董友講八萬，唔知係五萬公營三萬五千私營噉樣樣。噉你起到五萬啦，咁嗰啲人繼續起咪臨時咯，就咁簡單啫嘛。所以就第一。

204
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,700
你要同我講。

205
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,300
你點樣去制服嗰啲地產商先？

206
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:46,940
你點制服佢？畀錢去制服佢，不如叫我示威逼下佢。

207
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:53,020
你講嘅嘢，即係我覺得今日喺度講緊嘅，你講緊一個行政嘅問題。

208
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:59,900
即係個你哋認為嗰個target係得嘅，咁所以咧就問我哋攞錢整個target force。

209
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,730
噉，但係我問題就係。

210
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:12,360
係咪真嘅先？一事一樣，一陣間又話插針樓。嗱，有冇錢去？有冇有冇啲錢係去諗住點樣起插針樓嘅咧？

211
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,330
如果有嘅又白畀嘅，哎呀唔得嘅！原來喺個社區嗰度，老實講。

212
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,140
你講得最啱啊！

213
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,360
你哋講得最啱就係好多係遊説嘅工作，或者係諮詢嘅工作。

214
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,250
係咪？

215
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,630
噉你個你個政治上？

216
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,510
特首嚟講唔到啊嘛！

217
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,460
説服唔到人啊！呢就嗱，就係就我呢個。

218
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:55,120
誒啟德嗰笪地一時就話要要起樓，一你又改咗幾耐啊？即係嗰個誒，我住嗰個區啊，即即田嗰度，即嗰個誒機場跑道一時依樣，一時改，一時依樣，一又整條鐵路出去博出去，又唔做，阿哥。

219
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:05,110
點畀錢你啊？所以我我唔會鬧你。佢特首有問題啊嘛，同埋特手下邊嗰班木水有問題啊嘛。咩叫木水咧？即係佢講唔到嘢噉。

220
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,250
咁個就係，完全唔係咩嘅。

221
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,880
即係講盤好嘢嘅嗱，中央政策組唔掂。

222
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,870
噉就搞到特首唔掂，特首唔掂。

223
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,480
就你哋就落嚟攞錢，點畀錢嚟先？

224
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:33,520
因為因為呢個呢個真係好嚴重嘅問題，我我淨係淨係我因為我老實講，我真係冇做功課，我唔使睇做功課，我來一聽，我淨係聽到呢個梁振英上台之後做話做到做唔到嘅嘢。

225
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:39,990
叫埋嗰啲發展局局長啊，張炳良影相，話揾四幅地出嚟，嗰四幅地喺唔喺度啊？嗰個？

226
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,700
而家喺邊度我都唔知。

227
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,990
所以我覺得嗱，如果你話攞地係阿張炳良。

228
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:52,910
嘅工啊啊啊啊啊！陳茂波嘅工作，陳茂波而家都隱咗形，都唔知喺邊度。

229
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,800
陳茂波。

230
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:03,760
自己搞嗰個會計師嗰度咧，就搞到而家歐盟話：，喂，你個你個個議會冇做嘢，政府冇做嘢，我唔畀你會會計我哋㗎。

231
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,620
點教啊個？

232
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:16,110
我嗱，我就唔會畀錢你嘅。我講到明，因為我就覺得呢個係政治嘅問題。如果你特首唔能夠説服我哋呢個議會同意佢政策嘅時候，

233
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:24,130
同意佢嗰個四施政嘅理念嘅時候，佢政策一定有問題。佢政策嘅問題嘅時候，執行就執行唔到。所以各位公務員。

234
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,370
冇意思。

235
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:42,140
唔關你事，係你個波斯嘅波斯嘅事。我我即係我想問一問啦，到底淨係倉房嗰度，你哋用用咗幾多人手落去做嘢，即係話改改一萬個單位出嚟噉，跟住話唔得嗰度嘥咗幾多人人力物力，有冇計啊？

236
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,400
有冇㗎？

237
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:50,570
定係邊個局負責？一個三局負責，我哋用咗有冇偏外職位啊？或者首長非首長級做？

238
00:41:51,400 --> 00:42:00,170
有冇啊？你講一講使咗幾多錢？嗱，梁綺紅梁議員，你過曬時間啦。不過咧，因為冇人排隊，噉我請秘書長打理。

239
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,710
嗯。

240
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,580
Madam Chairman, a couple of things.

241
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:19,290
The issue of production, of course, I can say that we've already announced additional land that's been sought for this purpose, and that that will be coming out.

242
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,110
我諗。

243
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:28,810
Honestly, the land supply issue is is a complex one. It's not about just finding the land. You have to find land with the right

244
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:48,450
zoning the right conditions access and all of that unfortunately land supplies are very complex area so perhaps I'll leave that to development bureau talking about the exercise to look into industrial buildings again I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave that to development bureau I just don't know what the resources devoted to that exercise were.

245
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,980
噉我點畀錢你先？你嗰個一一個，你即係即係，其實你係要依靠第二個局。

246
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:06,440
去畀啲嘢你做啊嘛，係咪？咁誒啊，主席，我唔再問啦。即係你冇你又冇麵粉，有麵包啊嘛。如果未有麵粉，就請個麵包師翻嚟。

247
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,220
嗯，噉啊，畀謝偉全議員問一下。

248
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:21,880
誒就多謝主席畀我問，因為我就唔係呢個委員會嘅，不過我都關注呢個事。噉啊，房屋方面咧，其實即係當然非常重要咧。而家我哋其中誒。

249
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:42,170
喺香港，好多市民嚟講都希望喺呢度咧，政府係多做嘢解決嘅。咁誒，即係要多做嘢咧，咁誒增加呢個公務員人手咧，呢個原則上咧，我覺得即係好多人，包括我都會支持嘅。我覺得噉，因為你冇人手去做咧，噉你點樣點樣可以解決啲問題咧？噉樣。

250
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:59,560
噉啊，關於誒今次即係呢個誒有關即係話誒呢個開始一個首長級、丙級正務官嘅職位咧，我我有啲問題想問下，第一就呢個講嗰個長遠嘅房屋咧，其實基本上咧真係誒。

251
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:19,850
要要要一個房屋咧，即係動輒講緊好多年嘅，即係你搞呢個又又揾地啊，到到真係係可以供應到咧。咁點解呢個即係而家你就暫時可能頭先有人問咗主席，不過唔好意思，如果有問咗咧就即係即係我我我我我唔知道啊，因為啱到。咁點解兩年？

252
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:39,860
咧噉樣嚇，既然呢個問題咁咁重要啦，即係要解決嘅嘢，亦都唔係誒一朝一刻可以做曬所有嘢。咁第一點，第二點咧，你而家建議咧，就係咪即係嗰個特別職務咧？就而家你要開始之外咧，呢個另外都有啲非長非首長級嘅人員幫嘅，咁其中有八位，其實就我睇到係抽。

253
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:59,870
調出嚟嘅啫，喺房屋處裏邊噉。你你呢樣嘢其實係會唔會即係嗰個誒令到咧？即係原本你我相信房屋處而家嚟講咧，嗰個因為你要加增加嗰個供應咧嚇，嗰嗰個單位嘅供應咧已經係加。

254
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:18,940
大咗好多壓力㗎啦，噉我諗而家啲同事咧，你啲同事應該都係誒，即係喺呢方面咧，就已經承受好大壓力啦。噉你再抽調咗啲人咧，會唔會令到佢哋更加百上加斤咧？啲工作噉樣嚇兩點。唔該，主席嚇，貝先生。嗯，thank you，Madam Chair。嗯。

255
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:29,080
The reason that we've we've asked for two years is that we believe that the key policy issues that has to be addressed must be addressed quickly, and obviously.

256
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,920
We think two years is is already.

257
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:52,220
quite a reasonable period for for us to allow allow us to do that. Whether or not there would be a need for a further permanent post is something we deal with later. But we need to get on with this very quickly because obviously the the steering committee is going to submit its report very soon. And indeed, some of the recommendations have already been accepted as the chief.

258
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,570
Executive indicated in his recent policy address, so that the pressure is already on for this.

259
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:17,920
As I did describe a bit earlier, the work here really relates to those areas which are policy and not production-led. So it's things like the subdivided units, it's things like rent control and tenancy protection. Those are issues that we need to look at now because they are not current government policies. We need to consider those whether or not we take them forward.

260
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:37,930
That's what this exercise will be asked to do. In terms of the manpower within the department, again, as I was explaining earlier, we are actually seeking additional resources to deal with the production, management and maintenance of housing. But those are being dealt with separately, and in fact.

261
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:57,940
I will be coming back to the to the committee to seek approval for those posts separately. But I agree with you. Yes, colleagues are under some pressure. But obviously, I I do have colleagues that can be deployed for short-term purposes. But as a

262
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,300
長遠解決， obviously， I would have to seek long-term and permanent post， but that we will do in due course.

263
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:23,880
主席，即係我想係強調一樣嘢，因為佢誒嗰度有八個非首長級嗰啲咧，其實係我相信嗰陣時佢都係因為處理呢個房屋咧喺其他部門嗰度抽調出嚟嘅。咁而家你又再將佢入咗呢度，即係做兩年咧。而家講嗰個噉，其實即係我都係誒。

264
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:43,890
都想反映翻咧，其實即係房屋署都有唔少人咧表示咧，佢哋而家本身咧已經係即係係承受好大壓力啦。咁呢度嚟講咧，我真係希望咧政府咧真係考慮，即係唔好話誒，即係誒誒，因為想避任何嘢，因為點解咧？我覺得即係如果係需要人手嘅。

265
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:51,560
係做到嘢嘅，我相信咧，即係誒好多人都會支持，包括香港嘅市民。嚇，多謝主席。

266
00:47:52,490 --> 00:48:01,050
thank you，我我 take that point， we will be following up。啊，秘書長聽到啦，呢個人手問題，較早前我都提過，秘書長係知道嘅，哼。

267
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,140
噉啊，各位議員，就冇其他問題啦。

268
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,580
數據即係話。

269
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,640
嗰個湯房嗰度，佢哋嘥咗幾多時間同埋錢，因為你。

270
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:19,840
呢一點秘書長可以答答咧嚇劏房問題，諗住點樣處理啊？

271
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,490
Madam Chairman, the recommendations in the long term.

272
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:35,070
housing strategy steering committee's report deal with a number of different channels that we need to look at. They've addressed, for example.

273
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:55,560
this question of licensing or regulation. and now licensing could take the form of licensing of individual units, it could take the form of registration of of landlords, it could take the form of a mix of both landlord registration and licensing. so that's one area that we need to consider. another area is if you put in place some form of licensing in order to protect the

274
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:15,570
應當有租賃控制，就係租賃控制。

275
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,850
這些係啲嘢，我們需要去睇。

276
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:23,460
誒，主席佢咪誤會咗，因為誒，你都記得㗎啦，你都係行政會議嘅成員。

277
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,720
林鄭月娥。

278
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,140
同埋啊！

279
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:35,330
陳茂波講就係話，佢哋要搞劏房嘅問題，就承諾咗香港人咧，佢哋會。

280
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:41,610
即係改建嗰啲工廈嗰啲嘢咧，係力提供大概一萬個嘅單位出嚟。

281
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:55,000
去令到啲劏房嘅住户入去住，或者令佢咧係住得好啲。咁後屘就宣佈呢個計劃咧就取消啦，即係做唔到嘅，因為法例又有問題，改建又有問題。

282
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,760
即係嗰個效，即係嗰個效能太低啊！即係用好多錢都改建唔到，而且有法例嘅問題。

283
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,140
咁一定嘥錢㗎。

284
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,290
咁到底你哋嘥咗幾多錢，或者佢嘥咗幾多錢？你有冇有冇有冇語文？

285
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,630
即係你要明明啊！你請八個阿謝偉全嚟講得啱。

286
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,590
你叫咗佢做一樣嘢係毫無收穫嘅。

287
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,440
令到自己好沮沮喪嘅。

288
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,290
全香港作為笑柄嘅。

289
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:39,230
咁點教啊？噉你如果你有一個你考核啊嘛，係咪呢？呢個target即係即係唔係話個效唔係話淨係嗰啲input output啊？你個outcome啊，即係話你有個目標你做唔到，咁即係total total loss嚟嘅喎，哥。

290
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,680
即係做到好好都冇用嘅喎，噉我如果畀咗錢你？

291
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,750
噉我點樣面對啲選民啊？其實total lost。

292
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:57,750
有冇估計過啊？嗰度值唔值一個嘅？你哋攞嘅首長級頂級政治官編外職位一其中一個。

293
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,250
你要量度㗎嘛？

294
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:08,270
有冇啊？有冇啲數據啊？唔好計啊！陳陳茂波胡混啦，計你啊，又唔好計林鄭我啦，唉！

295
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,130
有冇？

296
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:18,740
有冇啲數據？Madam Chairman，as as I indicated before，the work to regulate。

297
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:39,310
subdivided units in industrial buildings is taken forward by buildings department, fire service department and development bureau. That is because of the way that the structure of government set up. That's I'm afraid something I can't answer. In so far as my team is concerned, of course we're funded by the housing authority. So again we're in a slightly separate situation to the rest.

298
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,230
政府，所以，我 sorry，我 just 可以 answer 那些 questions。

299
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,470
fair enough。

300
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,080
答唔到你問題。

301
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,580
啊！我諗佢諗緊嗰啲唔係你諗嗰啲嚇。

302
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,370
噉啊，仲有嗰委員仲冇其他問題啊？

303
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,330
如果冇咧，將呢個項目付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

304
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,810
反對嘅，請佢走。

305
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:15,060
噉啊，我認為係你反對一個反對一位委員反對，噉我認為係誒呢個項目咧就係獲得通過嘅嚇。

306
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,090
噉啊，多謝各位官員。

307
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:23,340
咁跟住咧，就係誒下一個項目。

308
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,490
就係社會福利處啊。

309
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,610
哦。

310
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,290
勞福局嘅啊，E C二零一三一四二一。

311
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:53,900
勞福局建議咧喺今年三月十號起至到二零一七六月三十止，保留勞福局一個首長級丙級政務官編外職位，首長級薪點第二，以繼續支援。

312
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,230
扶貧嘅工作。

313
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:02,880
噉啊！當局已經喺十二月九號咧，就呢項建議諮詢立法會福利事務委員會嘅。

314
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:19,540
咁出席會議答覆提問嘅公職人員包括勞福局嘅常任秘書長譚貢蘭女士、勞福局副秘書長陳毅先生、勞福局首席助理秘書長李思欣女士，嚇。

315
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:35,930
噉啊，因為勞福利事務委員會主席陳婉嫺議員唔係本小組委員會委員，佢亦都未能出席今日會議咧。我會根據委員會秘書已備嘅資料咧，簡單陳述事務委員會討論要點。

316
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:44,590
福利事務委員會喺舊年嘅十二月九日嘅會議咧，討論喺勞福局嘅首席。

317
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,190
秘書長。

318
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:56,890
討論開設誒將呢個首席秘書長扶貧偏外職位開設期咧延長到二零一七年六月卅號。

319
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:17,520
委員原則上支持有關建議，但鑑於該職位喺二零零八年三月已經開始啦，有委員促請政府日後檢討，係咪應該將個職位定為有時限嘅編外職位？抑或抑或應該改佢做一個常額嘅職位咧？

320
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,110
嚇。

321
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:25,790
有誒表示想提問嘅發問嘅議員就包括郭家麒議員、陳、鄧家彪、潘少平。

322
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,420
噉啊，郭嘉琪議員五分鐘。

323
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:29,870
主席。

324
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:36,740
嗱，我諗扶貧咧就係大家睇到今次嘅施政報告攞出嚟啦，但係其實爭議亦都好大嘅。

325
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:49,270
包括你而家你推出嚟個低收入個家庭補貼咧，係將一啲一人嘅家庭，即係嗰啲，譬如舉個例，單身夜貧窮嘅在職貧窮嗰啲咧剔除咗出嚟。

326
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:59,150
第二咧就係你嗰個兒童發展基金咧，我睇你文件咧，只係得六千，去到而家都係得六千個貧窮嘅兒童咧，係受呢個保護。

327
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,740
咁咪保護車受呢個資助。

328
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:10,060
噉就遠遠係低過喺香港，即係好多喺貧窮線以下貧窮家庭嘅兒童。

329
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:23,990
第二咧就係嗰啲，我都係睇一啲報道講咧，就係呢一啲嘅計劃咧，好多時幫佢唔到，因為你同佢儲錢啊，又或者點樣一配對都好咧，佢最需要嘅時候就畀佢唔到。

330
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:35,050
到佢大個嘅時候，噉啊啲錢可能如果真係唔好彩入唔到大學咧，喺副學士一次過就清曬袋嘅，呢個都係政府啲政策咧左右唔配合。

331
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:45,400
嗰個資助學額唔足夠，或者副學士即係係一個大騙局嚇，即係引起嘅一啲嘅一啲問題。咁另外一方面咧，你喺嗰個

332
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:54,360
誒，佢個職責入邊咧就講咗嗰個長期嗰個退休保障。嗱呢樣嘢咧，亦都令到我哋好失望。

333
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:09,670
政府係不斷喺度講啦嚇，咁而家就推咗畀阿周教授啦。咁周教授亦都即係我唔知佢做咗幾多係推嘅政府，但我相信周永新咧就已經做咗佢嗰部分。而家問題就係話政府研究。

334
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:15,100
又研究又研究，噉啊研究到幾時咧？而家呢個編內職位。

335
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,370
開咗三年啦。

336
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:37,690
噉你有冇個目標嘅？即係有冇一個好清楚，就話喺呢三年內都係要解決呢個問題，有一個具體個方案拎翻嚟畀公眾，畀翻立法會去透過立法。我講得好清楚係立法，因為而家呢樣嘢已經唔係做同埋唔做，而係點樣去做，係能夠保障到，因為呢個貧窮嘅問題。

337
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,160
咧。

338
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:43,250
即係政府而家做呢一個係解決咗一部分嘅，即係包括係在職。

339
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:59,730
又或者係一啲部分嘅，即係誒兒童嘅貧窮嘅問題。但係一個嚟緊呢十年，大家都知道啦。十年後個長者貧窮人口一路會加㗎啦。如果政府而家都唔喐嘅話咧，嗰個貧窮嗰個。

340
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:14,690
人口啊，不但止唔會少啊，肯定喺將來到佢退休年齡咧，不斷咁升嘅。呢個係咪香港或者特區政府樂於要建咧？呢一個職位究竟有啲乜嘢嘅承諾？喺呢度有冇一啲功課教？

341
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:35,540
嚇，嗯嗯，譚秘書長，好啊，多謝主席。主席其實呢個職位咧都唔係第一次開㗎啦。呢個職位咧喺二零零八年咧已經第一次開，而喺二零一一年咧亦都得到大家立法會議員嘅支持，亦都延長咗三年。咁喺我哋檢視過勞福局喺未來三年三個月嘅工作之後咧，我哋覺得我哋喺

342
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:55,550
係有需要繼續呢一個工呢個職位嘅延續，因為主要咧呢個職位嘅工作咧，正如我哋文件附件一係所以指出咧，呢個工作主要係支援喺勞福局裡面統籌扶貧嘅工作。咁當然喺我哋其中一個主要嘅工作咧，就係支援勞福局支援呢個誒扶貧委員會嘅工作。

343
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:15,560
咁所以，如果扶貧委員會有做一啲任何措施，而係要勞福局去執行或者係提供意見咧，呢一個職位嘅同事咧係會提供喺局裡面同埋局裡面嘅處方，即係包括勞工處啦、同埋社會福利處同埋我哋裡面局嘅咁多個其他嘅同事嘅統籌工作。

344
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:35,570
咁然後咧，亦都係喺做執行呢啲措施嘅時候咧，亦都負責呢個統籌嘅工作。咁順便講一講咧，頭先啊郭議員提嗰兩個誒一集咧，誒對於退休保障咧，周永生教授嘅團隊咧係將會喺今年稍後嘅時間咧向扶貧委員會提交報告。咁誒，我哋會即係。

345
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:55,580
復局，如果係有誒有需要跟進咧，我哋係會盡量配合嘅。咁至於扶貧誒，至於嗰個兒童發展基金咧，我哋喺特首嘅施政報告裡面咧，亦都承諾再畀多三億元嘅注資喺度。噉我哋遲啲咧會嚟立法會咧，就申請呢個撥款，咁即係會咧令到多啲兒童受惠。咁而呢個。

346
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:15,590
計劃嘅目標咧，主要係幫助兒童有三個目的嘅，就誒主要咧就係幫助啲誒，即係佢個家庭環境冇咁好嗰啲兒童咧，佢有機會咧，佢有成個儲蓄嘅習慣啦，自己定立一個即係發展嘅目標咧，去達到呢個目標，同埋咧最緊要咧亦都有師友嘅幫助，同埋有社福機構嘅參與。噉我哋亦都明白咧。

347
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:30,780
社福機構本身咧，佢有啲限制㗎，因為做呢啲工作嘅社福機構咧，亦都係即係數目亦都有個限制。所以我哋而家咧係嘗試咧試緊用學校為本嚟試下，用呢個機制去推，希望咧係多啲兒童咧能夠受惠嘅。

348
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,540
鄧家彪議員，多謝主席。

349
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:54,830
事實上咧，今年嘅施政報告咧，佢扶貧嗰個力度咧，或者項目咧，係多咗好多嘅。咁所以你話呢一個其實數來呢六年都係咁㗎啦，都係呢一個職位。咁即係夠唔夠做咧？過去六年或者起碼上一任嘅政府對扶貧咧係。

350
00:59:54,830 --> 01:00:14,840
唔夠積極，甚至係好多臨時啊、先導啊，全部都係敷衍嘅。咁今屆或者今年似乎啊著力好多，咁所以上屆或者上嗰幾年做啲咁消極、做一般嘅嘢，咁都要有一個。咁而家係咪真係可能仲要多啲咧？你哋個評估係點咧？

351
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,670
第一。

352
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:29,080
即係多一啲嘅偏外職位。第二咧就係，誒我哋都討論嘅嗰個低收入嗰個在職家人津貼，其實唔同嘅團體已經畀曬方案，最後咧你已經定咗一個。

353
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:49,370
大嘅即係原則，啲框架越講就越詳細嘅咧。基本上雖然你而家未有文件噉，但係唔知點解重要咧。下年先推出咁呢個職位，而家批准畀你繼續用，可唔可能加快咧？可唔可能唔需要等到一五年先至用到呢個計？

354
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:53,900
計劃咧，因為呢個誒計劃司長曾經講過，希望喺。

355
01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:04,670
啊，六七月可以去上到財會，亦都唔需要收禮㗎嘛？呢啲噉啊，純粹攞錢嘅啫。咁究竟得唔得咧？可唔可能如果真係六七月攞錢？

356
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:10,240
十月、九月就可以申請咧，甚至再早啲得唔得咧？

357
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,260
好，被申請人。

358
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:32,550
多謝主席。主席誒，多謝議員咧對誒，即係誒扶貧喺誒勞福局扶貧嘅同事嘅工作嘅誒關心。其實咧就誒過去誒同埋誒誒嘅工作裏面咧，的確誒扶貧嘅工作咧都係做咗好多，而喺未來咧，我哋相信個工作嘅力度都係。

359
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:52,560
會大嘅咁相信咧誒負責扶貧工作嘅同事咧嘅工作量咧係會誒更加即係辛苦一啲，但係誒我哋咧因為誒呢個職位本身咧係做一個統籌同埋支援嘅工作，咁其他誒勞福局嘅其他同事，包括埋誒兩個處嘅同事咧，係都會作出喺佢哋嘅工作。

360
01:01:52,560 --> 01:02:12,570
度作出支援，即係我哋係夾埋一齊去做嘅。咁希望呢個工作咧係誒做得好。咁如果我哋喺做嘅工作，我哋會不時檢視。如果我哋做嘅工作上覺得我哋某一啲工作，我哋係要加強。我哋睇下內部咁去點樣調配人手。如果誒內部調配人手時出現困難，噉我哋當然會同。

361
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:32,580
誒誒，即係誒誒，公務員事務局商量點樣去處理啊嗰個人手嘅問題。噉我哋務求咧係將個扶貧工作咧喺勞福局要做嘅工作係做得好嘅。咁另外咧就我哋明白議員關心咧誒呢個低津嗰個施行係希望咧盡早去實施。咁正如行政長官。

362
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:52,590
咧喺佢個施政報告都指出咧，呢一個計劃本身咧係一個非常之重要同埋牽涉港澳嘅計劃。噉佢亦都希望咧喺我哋喺操作細節裡面咧需要深思熟慮，以免咧我哋咧能夠達唔到嗰個政策目標，或者同個政策目標出現喺即係操作上同佢出現相反，或者唔能夠達到完全。

363
01:02:52,590 --> 01:03:12,600
達到個政策目標嘅情況，或者係會出現一啲操作唔能夠順暢推行，而令到第日啲市民覺得不便，或者係咧出現濫用嘅情況。咁所以咧，我哋喺而家已經開始咧係積極咁咧去睇一睇誒呢個操作嘅情況咧一啲細節嘅。咁包括咧就喺誒。

364
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:32,610
點樣去接受呢啲申請啦？盡量去令到點樣私人嘅資料得到保障啦？申請嘅資格嘅細節啦，制定內部嘅指引啦，同埋工作程序啊噉樣。咁即係仲有好多呢啲嘅工作。但係我哋明白，我睇佢細心處理呢啲工作，唔好默誒令到呢啲工作出現唔順暢或者出現。

365
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:52,620
同個政策有抵觸嘅情況之餘，亦都要注重呢個效率。咁所以我哋會盡快，即係好有效率咁去展開工作。噉我哋誒都明白誒，盡量希望咧，務求喺二零一五年咧推出呢個措施嘅。咁咁即係都係維持原本嘅答案係咪啊？我哋都好努力㗎，去做呢個工作㗎。

366
01:03:52,620 --> 01:04:12,630
咁似乎即係有啲令到民間失望啦，因為其實已經聚焦咗而家討論緊工時係咪比較多嘅問題啫。咁點解仲要等咁耐咧？係咪因為你預備可能保障部要請更多嘅人手咧？將啲生活津貼你又要請咗百幾個啦。呢一個如果真係新

367
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:23,150
真真嘅個案有可能去到二三十萬嘅，係咪喺呢一方面你哋係憂慮要請人，會令到你成個計劃慢咗？係咪淨係得呢個原因令到你咁謹慎？

368
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:43,890
啊，秘書長，多謝主席。嘅主席其實咧，好正如我頭先講，誒都舉咗一啲例子啦。咁喺其實做每一個呢啲類似嘅措施咧，我哋都要做一啲前期嘅工作嘅，都係要咧做一啲細節上嘅安排同埋設計嘅工作嘅。咁誒，個工作係非常之多啦。頭先我舉咗一啲例子。

369
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:54,770
咁但係包括嘅咧，亦都包括頭先議員講，我哋對於個地方嘅安排啦、辦事處嘅安排啦，同埋誒甚至係人手嘅安排咧，我哋都會要考慮嘅。

370
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,780
潘少平議員，誒多謝主席。

371
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:19,070
就其實就好難話唔批畀你，即係呢個編外職位。咁當然，即係大家都關注咧，就係實上呢個編外職位點解唔去常額咧？咁當然而家你個考慮就係去到二零一七年六月卅號啦，就跟阿阿行政長官嗰個任期啦。咁其實我主要又想再跟進一個問題咧，就係。

372
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,530
因為事實上，誒。

373
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:40,840
即係你嗰個誒架構圖裏邊咧，即係呢個開設呢個位咧，噉就誒當然其實而家架構圖冇副局長啦，係嘛噉就誒我我主要就係想跟進咧，就係話你有官咁跟住有幾多兵咧，即係即係要協助，因為事實上嚟緊嗰個。

374
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:58,310
誒獎誒呢個低收入津貼咧，事實上係即係誒大家好關注噉，我都好同意正話有議員講要加快咁響呢個即係你哋嗰個構思裏面，除咗呢個官之外，整體個兵係點樣咧？可唔可以喺度介紹下咧？係，阿編書長。

375
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:18,600
多謝主席。呢一個職位主要嘅工作咧，係喺政策局喺勞福局嘅層面咧，負責統籌誒呢一個誒誒勞福局裡面咧個扶貧措施嘅誒誒工作。咁當然呢個誒低津嘅工作咧，亦都係佢負責嘅誒統籌範圍。但係佢主要咧係喺政策上邊同誒。

376
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:38,610
嘅配合咁喺執行方面咧，我哋將會有執行機構。咁而執行機構嘅人手嘅安排咧，我哋係其中一樣嘢。我哋係會同執行機構咧係商討，同埋咧跟住咧，我哋係會同誒就嗰個實際需要咧去同誒公務員事務局係討論，然後咧有適當嘅時候咧，我哋會。

377
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:46,400
誒誒，如果有需要，我哋會誒同議員報告嘅。即係我我想再問一句，即係而家換句説話咧，你嗰個誒？

378
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:54,650
勞福局個整體編制係冇增加人嘅，因為嗱，你而家一零三啊嘛，係嘛，即係換句説話，呢個係延續一個位啫。

379
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,950
冇錯。誒，多謝主席。我哋喺盧福嗰個編制上邊係冇增加人嘅。

380
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:23,040
噉就跟住到我啦。啊，咁阿文文秘書長就，如果我冇記錯嘅話咧，喺施政報告第五廿五段咧，誒特首又提到咧個貧窮線可能要加多唔知一條定半條咁啦，係嘛？即係有有人話誒中位家庭收入五十都唔唔得，要六十噉。

381
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:43,050
咁政府考慮加多誒一條啦，咁咁第一呢個做法好少有嘅嚇，甚任何申請誒中緩啊公屋啊居屋都畫一條線嘅，咁要有人話呢條線唔配合我又畫多半條噉，噉你後患無窮嘅喎。你第一係咁啦，第二呢半條。

382
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,640
你點畫咧？因為如果你畫得太窄咧，嚇。

383
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:56,630
即係我揾多八百蚊少六百蚊，噉我不如唔做。噉你喺外國好多研究就鼓勵向下流動啊。咁點解政府要咁做咧？

384
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,490
即係有人嘈就畫多半條線，咁咪冇曬原則做嘢。

385
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:21,480
誒多謝主席。主席其實咧，呢一個關於扶貧誒呢個低津嘅個設計咧，亦都喺扶貧委員會咧都有一啲討論嘅，即係同埋扶貧委員會嘅屬下一個專責小組咧，亦都作出好多討論。咁誒喺啊決定究竟喺嗰個誒收入嗰度咧係點樣處？

386
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:41,490
理嘅時候咧，附平誒個建議咧，就係話我哋誒當然要睇一睇誒嗰個誒誒誒，即係總誒家庭收入嘅中位數啦。呢個係其中一個我哋會睇嘅啦。咁另外我哋都會睇一睇咧，就係話如果係對比比較中位數高少少嘅時候。

387
01:08:41,490 --> 01:09:01,500
我哋會唔會誒達到畀都畀一畀呢一啲人都畀一個半額佢咧？等到嘅咧，佢有個防貧嘅作用咧。咁於是咧，就有由六十誒五十同埋六十之間咧。噉我哋咧就會覺得可以畀個半額噉樣。咁呢個咧喺特首嘅施政報告裡面咧，亦都有提到啦。頭先誒啊主席都有提過，就係咧達至一個。

388
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:17,300
個防即係防止佢跌入去，即係誒嗰個誒，即係要需要更誒更誒，第日要去充換啦，或者係防噴嘅作用咧，希望達到呢個目的。咁喺設計上咧，亦就係考慮咗呢一啲原則嘅。

389
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:33,400
即係秘書長，我仍然係好擔心咯。即係一個好不良嘅先例。噉你第日所申請所有政府嘅誒嘅福利，你可以話啊，益唔到我喎，我高少少，唔該你畫多半條啊咁嚇。

390
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,700
咁同埋你嗰個設計，你即係好可能影響人向下流動咯。

391
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:59,610
誒多謝主席。咁主席誒，我哋喺設計呢一個低樽嘅時候咧，係就低樽嗰個誒政策目標啦，同埋啊其誒相關嘅考慮咧而作出嘅一個即係設計上嘅安排。呢個咧係唔會影響即係中門啊，或者其他政府誒誒提供嘅。

392
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:12,720
誒資助啊，或者其他嘅誒服務誒嘅嘅，即係而家嘅採取嘅情況嘅安排嘅。你有咗具體建議點樣畫未啊？即係個半條定點樣？

393
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,520
有咗眉㗎，因為施政報告睇唔到啦，我又唔係扶貧委員會嘅成員啦，有冇㗎？

394
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:39,460
幾時可以畀我哋睇睇啊？其實誒，我哋而家主要都係話咧，就係喺誒誒入息嘅每月嘅家庭入息嘅中位數嘅五十個percent咧，就係誒我哋如果佢達到呢啲目標，亦都達到其他佢合資格嘅資格咧，譬如佢資產啊，同埋佢工時啊，佢都能夠。

395
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:50,720
符合咧，噉佢就係攞到個全額嗰個津貼嘅。但係如果佢嘅誒收入咧係去到五十到六十個percent咧，佢只可以攞半額。

396
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,450
攞本額。

397
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:01,750
咁希望你哋評估下，希望將來咧係要一路密切注意評估下，即係對於向上下流嘅影響。

398
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:09,840
多謝主席，呢個係我哋關注嘅，我哋都希望呢個計劃能夠促進人。即係對唔住，我講錯咗向下流動嘅影響。明白，明白。

399
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,190
姚思榮議員。

400
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:16,600
係都係主席嗰個誒加呢個位，我一般就係同意啊。

401
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,740
但係問題咧，我啊就覺，即係份工作係一個長遠工作嚟嘅。

402
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:33,650
但係政府啊，只係話將呢個位啊去誒，即係延到三年定三個月啦。到時先至再睇進度，再決定係咪誒延延聘啦，或者係變成常額啦。

403
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:54,070
噉我始終覺得好似一個被動嘅角色啊，即係話誒，一扶貧委員會成立咗啦，所以我就有個位繼續畀延落去啦噉樣。咁而扶貧委員會即係可能話一段時間工作完咗啦，可能就呢個人嘅公就唔係完咗啦。咁畀人覺得即係我我我都同意阿潘少平。

404
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:57,050
講啲誒點解唔變咗常額咧？係咪啊？

405
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:05,650
噉啊！如果你上額嗰個做嗰個同事，先知道，誒，我有工作任務乜嘢，我點考慮一個長遠性同連續性。

406
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:25,940
一變咗咧，嗰個延續性問題咧，就就冇乜延續性嘅，就睇嗰個扶貧委員嘅工作進度，我嚟協配合佢啦。即係嗰個個角色相當之被動嘅，個責任咧又唔係好清楚。所以我覺得咧，即係既然而家你要求誒有一個噉嘅申請啦，噉你點能夠保？

407
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,430
保證佢嘅工作咧。

408
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:35,840
嗰個獨立同長遠性，同埋對未來工作延續性方面有咩具體措施，使到呢個人有個責任喺度咧噉樣。

409
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:56,740
啊，秘書長，多謝主席。咁亦都多謝議員嘅意見嘅。其實呢個意見，我哋都喺誒福利事務委員會都聽到。頭先啊潘議員都有講過。咁如果議員同意嘅話，呢個職位咧，將誒可以保留到二零一七年六月嘅話，我哋喺呢個期限之前咧，我哋會係就勞福局裡面嘅扶。

410
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:16,750
貧工作嘅情況啦，同埋考慮誒特區政府誒對貧貧工作誒誒勞福局需要嘅支援咧，去作出一個全誒全面嘅檢視。誒呢個檢視咧會包括呢個職位所需要嘅時限啦、佢嘅職級啦，同埋喺香誒成個勞福局裡面嘅貧貧組裡面。

411
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,190
嘅人手編制嘅。

412
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:26,750
噉我哋會喺即係適當時候咧，就會向立法會提交即係我哋嘅誒建議嘅，如果有需要。

413
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:40,220
要醫院嚇，主席，我睇佢報嗰度講咧，到一七年嘅六月三十號會因應嗰個輔仁工作進度檢視繼續保留此職位嘅需要，即係去到到期嗰日，你先考慮。

414
01:13:40,800 --> 01:14:00,810
誒多謝主席。主席好似頭先我講咧，我哋會以呢個限期嚟做一個即係誒目標嚟睇一睇，到翻轉頭睇睇，我哋會喺之前喺適當時候，我哋就會作出呢個檢視。然後當然我哋誒又將我會將，如果我哋要即係誒請議員支持，我哋一咩建議，我哋會嚟同議。

415
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:20,820
喺適當時候到誒誒報告嘅。如果係話到呢個時間，我就唔係好贊成，即係去到先算啦噉樣。喂，扶貧工作唔係話去到先算嘅喎，係嘛？而且睇睇到香港嘅，即係特首都話啦，貧即係貧窮問題冇可能杜絕嘅，即係貧窮嘅問題一定係喺。

416
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:40,830
香港係長期產生嘅，係咪一定要有一個長期政策？每個政策入面咧，每一個階段都有個延續性嘅。因為噉嘅樣咧，我覺得你好似係一個真係任務式嘅，到時都先選咧。我覺得呢個係完全我接受唔到呢個解釋嘅，所以我寧願你係咪一年前我就要檢討呢個職位係咪需要，而唔係話去到。

418
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:20,850
係噉，即係我講得唔係好清楚。我我冇噉樣嘅意思。我嘅意思係希望喺二零一七年六月之前，我哋會喺適當時間就會做呢個設施誒呢個檢視。咁所以誒，即係我哋會唔會係即係好似議員擔心噉，去到二零一七年六月三十號呢個職位到到誒都要二。

419
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:32,960
延續啦，我哋或者係已經要冇啦，我哋先至會做呢一個檢視，唔會嘅。我哋會喺之前就會做呢個檢視。咁誒，啲議員你話要起碼即係一年前開始睇，我哋呢個意見我哋係聽到嘅。

420
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,110
