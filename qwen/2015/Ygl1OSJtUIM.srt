21

咁誒，請誒秘長係咪可以誒簡介一下有關嘅文件？好誒，多謝主席誒，各位，我哋今日出席工商事務委員會嘅會議，就係要向大家簡介一下誒投資推廣處喺過去嗰一年嗰個工作，同埋喺今年二零一五年嘅誒主。

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:58,530
主要嘅工作嘅重點，咁其實大家都知道，投資推廣處係一直誒致力推廣我哋誒香港嘅營商嘅優勢，吸引係誒海外、內地同埋台灣嘅企業咧誒，用香港作為據點去發展佢哋嘅業務。咁誒喺二零零零年投資推廣處成立以嚟咧，係已經係成功協助。

23
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,750
在咗超過三千四百間嘅企業嚟香港設立，或者係拓展業務。

24
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,700
咁呢啲企業咧喺佢誒開業或者擴展業務嘅第一年裏邊咧，係一共係開設咗超過三萬七千五百個新嘅職位。

25
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:31,230
咁喺舊年嚟講，雖然誒世界上嘅經濟咧係面臨各方面嘅挑戰，但係投資推廣局仍然係成功引進咗三百五十五間海外、內地同埋台灣嘅企業咧嚟香港設立誒呢個辦事處或者係擴展佢嘅業務。呢個數字咧係咁多年嚟嘅誒最最高嘅紀錄。咁呢方面咧係代表到誒誒我哋投資推

26
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:41,230
講工作嗰方面嘅成效，亦都證明咗香港咧係仍然有誒一個良好嘅基礎同埋營商嘅優勢，可以吸引到其他地方嘅企業咧嚟我哋呢度咧係開業。

27
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:57,260
誒，今年投資推廣處當然會繼續佢哋推廣推動呢個海外、內地同埋台灣企業嚟香港個投資。誒，佢哋會誒特別係加強喺呢個內地啊，同埋一啲主要新興市場，例如東盟等等嘅誒工作。呢啲都係我哋重點嘅市場。

28
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:17,550
咁當然我哋亦都係誒會加強宣傳香港作為一個全球創業樞紐嘅地位，吸引更加多創業嘅商家利用香港咧，係拓展佢哋嘅業務。呢個咧係投資推廣處呢幾年咧其中一個好重要嘅工作嘅重點。咁詳細個情況，不如啊主席，如果你同意的話咧，我請啊誒投資推廣處嘅處長啊賈佩蓮。

29
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,600
先生咧，向大家再解釋一下。嚇，多謝主席。好，唔該啊，大家。

30
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:41,380
先生，好。如果我可 highlights 一些 of the results for 2014。 last year, Invest Hong Kong assisted a record number of 355 companies from overseas, mainland and Taiwan, to either set up or expand their business in Hong Kong.

31
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:56,750
這些355個項目 led to the creation of over 2,650 jobs within the first year of their operation or expansion, and they brought in 8.9 billion Hong Kong dollars in direct investment.

32
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:17,680
The completed projects came from a total of 47 economies, with mainland China being the largest single source of investment. We had a total of 75 completed projects from the mainland, followed by the US with 44 projects, Japan with 28 projects, the UK with 32.

33
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,670
和最後，法國有25個項目。

34
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:34,720
for the first time, Invest Hong Kong has helped companies from new economies for us, economies such as Bangladesh, Cyprus, Kuwait, Poland, Romania, Tajikistan to set up in Hong Kong.

35
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:50,770
And in terms of the business sectors where we've seen a large number of projects, we've seen quite a few projects in the tourism and hospitality sector, the transport and industrial sector, as well as in innovation and technology and asset management.

36
00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:04,950
香港的 institutional strengths and business-friendly environment continue to attract a diversified range of companies, ranging from global operations down to entrepreneur-led startups.

37
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:20,030
In 2014, we continued to approach target companies in key geographic markets through our global network of 15 investment promotion units based in the economic and trade offices.

38
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:32,090
The office in Beijing and Taiwan Economic Trade and Cultural Office， as well as the 14 overseas consultants in strategic locations not covered by the IPUs。

39
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:45,560
Colleagues overseas conducted over 6,300 meetings, one-to-one meetings with companies, and provided on-the-spot advisory support and guidance to them.

40
00:07:46,410 --> 00:08:05,560
aside from meeting with clients and organising our own sector-focused events, we also work closely with other Hong Kong Inc members, including the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, the Cyberport and many others, to promote Hong Kong as an ideal business platform.

41
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:24,510
last year we continued with our worldwide initiative the start me up Hong Kong initiative, which is aimed at really promoting Hong Kong as a leading hub for entrepreneurship and to encourage innovative and scalable startups to use Hong Kong as a launchpad to grow their businesses.

42
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:41,860
我們launch了StartMeUp Venture Program Competition again in July 2014， and this competition recorded a 40% increase both in the number of entries as well as the source economies of the entries for this global business plan competition.

43
00:08:42,790 --> 00:09:02,800
We had a week-long programme in November two thousand and fourteen, where we brought in overseas and Hong Kong-based startups and founders and other stakeholders in the startup community, including angel investors, co-workspace operators and other incubators. We also staged a series of roadshows and.

44
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:14,290
Networking of events in major startup hubs, including Israel, the US, UK, France and India, between May and September 2014.

45
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:31,420
作為之前提到，主land 仍係我們最大嘅完成項目來源。喺2014年，我們組織咗總共26場講座，喺21個主land 城市，包括天津、石家莊、合肥、杭州同武漢。

46
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:48,510
這些事件旨在鼓勵更多Mainland公司使用香港作為其平台去全球，我們舉行了總共超過1,750場投資促進會議，一對一與這些Mainland企業。

47
00:09:49,080 --> 00:10:00,360
我們也組織一些聯合海外活動，以目標海外城市與我們的合作伙伴從波羅的海地區，來展示我們地區的商機。

48
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:16,510
And looking ahead for 2015, despite the global uncertainties, we aim to increase our target of completed projects from 350 in 2014 to 370 in 2015.

49
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,770
為達成此更高目標，我們將繼續強化投資促進努力，透過以下策略。

50
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:39,920
首先，會focus our promotional efforts on the priority sectors and industries where Hong Kong has a clear competitive advantage， with an emphasis on financial services，creative industries，as well as information and communication technology sectors.

51
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:55,240
我們將繼續優先將資源聚焦於成長地區和國家，包括本土、亞太經濟體、法國、以色列和英國，以及更強調拉丁美洲。

52
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:13,640
我們將強化我們努力吸引全球startups設立businesses在香港，和促進香港作為領先的hub for startups and entrepreneurship。我們將繼續促進香港作為一個理想的平台，讓內地公司走向全球，針對快速成長的內地城市。

53
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:26,340
And finally, we'll continue to provide aftercare support to mainland companies already established in Hong Kong, to encourage them to locate their global, regional, and other more strategic functions in Hong Kong.

54
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:37,870
我的 colleagues and I will be happy to answer any comments and suggestions that the panel members may have with respect to our investment promotion work. 謝謝。唔該曬。誒，下面嘅。

55
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,950
提問嘅議員咧，而家暫時係兩位，所以我哋啊三位、四位。

56
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:53,990
O.K.五分鐘好唔好啊？好，第一位林建峯，第二位莫乃光，跟住係誒錢仲佳，跟住係劉慧卿。

57
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:14,480
誒，仲有廖長江嚇，噉我順序我讀咗下。咁第一位啊，林建峯議員，唔該。誒，多謝主持。啊，正話啊，投資推廣處處長都有講到啦，就即係今年我哋都面對好多不同嘅挑戰。噉啊，響整個啊全球。

58
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:32,870
性嘅經濟咧，亦都未完全復甦。咁但係你哋亦都係審慎樂觀。噉你哋亦都誒希望可以幫到三百七十間嘅公司嚟香港設立佢哋嘅業務㗎，即係比舊年亦都係有大約你話四點二個percent上升。

59
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:53,160
噉啊啊！但係推廣還推廣，人哋實際搬唔搬嚟啊兩回事嚟㗎。咁喺推廣上邊啊，我最近都聽到有好多即係唔同外國嘅商家啦，即係表達佢對香港一啲關注啊，例如啊，即係而家近期。

60
00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:13,200
港幣，因為我哋同美金係掛鈎嘅，咁而家係強勢啦。咁誒，香港最近亦都發生咗好多事情啦，例如佔中，影響到香港嘅誒經濟啊，同埋個交通啊等等運作啊。咁亦都誒，我哋立法會裏邊都有一啲。

61
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:33,210
誒政策上邊嘅嘢咧，就遲遲未能通過嘅。咁呢啲都係佢哋關注嘅。咁再加埋一路以嚟咧，誒租金貴啊，誒呢個空氣上邊嘅質素啊，都仲未有一個好大嘅改善。咁再加埋呢個國際學校咧，仍然都係。

62
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:53,220
誒有唔足夠嘅誒嘅嘅數字喺度，咁即係你點樣去應付呢啲噉嘅問題？咁誒咁同埋我哋嘅優勢，我哋成日講話，我哋響香香港響誒整個亞太區嚟講，整個亞洲嚟講咧，仍然係有一個優勢嘅。咁但係。

63
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:13,230
我哋睇翻最近heritage誒誒foundation出嚟嗰個報告嗰度咧，亦都提出咗好多我哋要關注嘅地方。噉我想問一問署長咧，即係點樣去平衡呢啲噉嘅外國投資者嘅關注，同埋香港？你覺得你哋個署同埋啊整個局咧，有邊一方？

64
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:22,870
便可以係誒做得到嘅，令到佢哋嚟香港投資咧更安心咧。誒，比張衞潮誒處長答啊。誒，多多謝主席，或者我。

65
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:43,360
兩句，然後我請阿嘉佩玲處長再詳細啲誒回答啊。林建峯議員當剛才提出即係幾方面嗰個關注啊。咁誒，當然我哋誒做呢個投資推廣，做呢個吸引誒外來嘅投資嚟香港嘅時候，我哋一路都係要好強調香港本身嗰個優勢，香港本身嗰個獨特嘅情況。

66
00:14:43,360 --> 00:15:03,370
咁即係我哋喺嗰個營商環境裏邊，我哋能夠做啲咩功夫去便利呢個外商喺香港去開業或者拓展呢樣業務？呢啲都係我哋每一年每一次同呢個外商去接觸嘅時候咧，誒一定係好強調個重點嘅。誒呢啲亦都係我哋吸引到誒即係外商嚟香港嘅情況。我哋本身係優勢，加埋我哋係去呢個。

67
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:23,380
誒，即係內地經商一個好重要一個門户。噉，剛才議員所講一係列嘅情況，誒香港本身個政治啊、社會嘅情況啊，我哋嗰個誒租金啊，或者空氣啊，或者係呢個國產效等等咧。誒，委實亦都係投資推廣處嘅同事咧，每一次去同呢個外商去誒誒討論同埋去即係。

68
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:43,390
遊水過嚟香港開業嘅時候咧，都係要面對同埋都係要好詳細解釋嘅問題。或者呢方面咧，我我我我請個處長用佢第一身嘅經驗誒，話同大家講講，即係佢哋喺呢個誒吸引呢個外來投資嘅時候，點樣去誒解釋畀誒誒外商知呢啲問題，香港係點樣去處理嘅。唔該，處長。

69
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, it's true that we face certain challenges when we're communicating and selling Hong Kong, particularly to audiences that don't know our city so well—audiences in Europe and North America.

70
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:04,450
The key one is cost. You know, everybody hears about the headlines where we have some of the world's highest office rentals.

71
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:14,420
但 to to try and address this, what we try to explain is that despite the fact that we have some of the most expensive office buildings in in the world.

72
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:25,780
what is fairly unique to Hong Kong is that within a fairly small geographic area we have a whole range of different office accommodation options at very different prices.

73
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:46,070
And so the perception of that high cost is often more of a challenge than the reality. When we can actually get decision makers and entrepreneurs to visit Hong Kong, and we can show them the different office accommodation options, particularly in the new co-work spaces that are opening up in Shung Wan in Western District.

74
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:58,340
Generally speaking, we can show them that Hong Kong need not be as expensive as they first thought, particularly if they are starting off with a very small command and control type office in Hong Kong.

75
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:18,860
Of course, the fact that the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar is also something that is going to be a challenge for us, particularly when we're getting investment from the eurozone. But our pipeline of projects—these are the companies that are considering setting up in Hong Kong over the next eighteen months.

76
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,450
is as strong today as it's ever been, so we're cautiously optimistic.

77
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:45,210
啊！主主主席，我正話提出有幾個問題咯。我都希望唔係一一句嘅啫。我希望局方咧將有關嘅情況咧，即係例如國際學校啊、啊空氣質素啊，咁同有關當局反映依一方面，希望佢哋去啊improve嚇。好，畀張誒呢個係意見嚇，阿偉。

78
00:17:45,210 --> 00:18:05,220
莫乃光言唔該，主席。誒，我就特別關注咧點樣去吸引多啲海外嘅科技公司嚟到香港誒發展佢哋嘅業務嘅，因為我見到咧誒聽到知道咧都係好多呢啲噉嘅科技公司咧，佢都係揀選佢哋亞洲發展嘅時候咧，就往往去曬好多其他嘅。

79
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:25,230
國家或者城市咧，差唔多最後先至嚟到香港嘅。噉啊，你可以舉到啲例子，我都見到有啲例子咧。譬如你啲Amazon啊，佢哋做雲端，而家最厲害嘅。咁但係咧，都係主要喺新加坡嗰度。咁譬如近期我喺香港見到呢兩年有幾間即係美國可以講話未上市、最市值最高嘅一啲創業公司啦。

80
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:45,240
噉啊，Uber啊、Airbnb啊、Help啊呢啲噉嘅公司咧，佢哋全部咧都係誒差唔多去曬其他呢啲主要嘅地方，新加坡啊等等，最後先至嚟香港。咁但係咧，即係其實對佢哋嚟講咧，點解嚟唔點解會噉樣選擇咧？噉樣好多時我又覺得可能未必係頭先啊，處長講嗰個cost。

81
00:18:45,240 --> 00:19:05,250
嗰個即係即係租租office嗰個地方嘅問題。當然呢啲公司可能係因為佢哋已經比較誒比較有錢㗎啦，咁當然佢哋亦都發展潛力高咯，賞佢哋嚟啦。咁可能佢哋係對香港嗰個理解、瞭解初時係唔足夠。另一個更加大嘅原因咧，就係會感覺到咧一啲地方好似新加坡啊，主要都係新加坡。

82
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:25,260
馬來西亞等等啲地方咧，佢哋係比香港咧係積極好多嘅，主動去到人哋嗰度咧，一早就去邀請佢哋過去嘅。噉啊，你見到咧喺數碼數據中心嗰度，我哋已經近期見到，即係我哋而家仲喺度誒Google走咗，唔肯嚟香港起，噉我哋香港就都誒好多人都仍然在通啦嚇。

83
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:45,290
噉啊！但係咧，你見到嗰個嗰個嗰件事咧，好明顯咧，台灣係比我哋咧係非常之積極嘅。咁有陣時咧，就我哋係需要政策去配合呢啲公司嚟。有陣時其實唔需要嘅，可能就係佢哋你要去揾下佢哋。所以我都想問咧，就係即係誒，你哋會唔會過往即係主要都係集中做一啲可能？

84
00:19:45,290 --> 00:20:05,300
可能去啲唔同地方搞啲活動啊，噉樣樣將來咧會唔會可以比較針對性咁有一啲重點嘅誒，譬如新興嘅創新科技方面嘅公司係喺海外嘅，甚至內地嘅，係去主動噉樣去邀請佢哋嚟香港。咁特別一個地方，當然就。

85
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:25,310
係誒直谷啦嚇噉，因為咧誒，頭先講啲公司好多都係嚟自嗰度嘅。咁而且咧，我哋見到近期咧，新加坡同台灣非常之積極，佢直情喺直谷咧開啲數以億元計嘅基金，一方面就投資佢哋本地公司去嗰度擴展業務，另一方面係調翻轉咧係吸引嗰度。

86
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:45,320
嘅公司咧，去佢哋嗰個國家，喂，台灣啊、新加坡啊或者地區啊，咁去做生意嘅，去去發展去業務嘅。咁呢方面咧，香港可以點樣去去去競爭咧？同埋甚至乎除咗個別公司之外，吸引一啲譬如創投基金啊，或者而家好多嘅incubator、accelerator。

87
00:20:45,320 --> 00:21:04,520
啊噉樣樣喺依啲譬如植谷啊等等依啲地方誒吸引佢哋嚟香港，幫助一唔單止本地公司，亦都係外國你哋嘅對象嘅一啲創業嘅公司。呢方面你哋嘅集中嘅工作可以或者有啲咩計劃，或者會做啲乜嘢嘢咧？唔該，主席。啊，被長還是處長答。

88
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:25,230
Well, it's certainly true that that we face tremendous competition for the high technology companies that the honourable members mentioned. Not only from leading cities in Asia, but leading cities around the world are all chasing exactly the same group of high growth technology-related companies.

89
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:45,240
But it's certainly true that Hong Kong is changing in terms of the way people perceive Hong Kong. Up until recently, it's true that people saw Hong Kong as a centre for large multinationals and for financial services. But with the rapid growth of our startup ecosystem in the last.

90
00:21:45,240 --> 00:22:05,250
Last two or three years, Hong Kong is starting to to be seen differently by a lot of technology companies. And if I can give you a bit of an example, we've seen this rapid growth in the number of co-workspaces in Hong Kong from three in 2010 to now almost 40. And some of the bigger companies are.

91
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,270
Moving into this space, so for example, Accenture.

92
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:28,560
Have set up a data co-workspace in Hong Kong aimed at attracting financial services technology companies. KPMG have moved their data analytics centre, their second only in the world, to to be here in Hong Kong. And Hong Kong does have some real advantages and real strengths.

93
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:48,570
In attracting companies in certain certain areas, things like Internet of Things, things like wearable devices, and in terms of financial services technology. So we're starting to see Hong Kong becoming more and more important when when companies are looking at their locations in our region.

94
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:48,940
係。

95
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:59,960
And of course, proximity to big companies like Tencent and Huawei is also something that's attracting people to to set up here in Hong Kong.

96
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:20,280
主席一一句襟名啫，係誒。I really like to see more targeted誒efforts in attracting growth stage companies from Silicon Valley or UK Cambridge誒，and Israel and places like those. Very targeted effort。Thank you。啊，呢個係阿莫議員嘅一個suggest。

97
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:29,590
嗯，我諗誒，創新科技局咧要嗱嗱聲快啲成立先得，唔係點樣樣嚟溝溝緊呢啲誒創新科技嘅。

98
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,480
跟住下一位啊，前座嘉義。

99
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:42,990
主席，我見到咧，誒喺你哋文件裏邊咧就提述到咧，就係舊年咧都係一個比較多內地公司嚟香港嘅噉樣。

100
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,050
噉就誒，而家內地咧就誒，習近平主席咧就。

101
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,000
強力打貪腐。

102
00:23:51,290 --> 00:24:06,070
咁咧就我想問啊，投資推廣處有冇你個系統裏邊有啲咩措施係防備咧？內地啲貪腐嘅人士咧，係借投資為名將資資產轉移到嚟香港噉樣樣，你有冇啲？

103
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,360
成個引資嘅過程裏面有啲咩嘢係誒誒誒？

104
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:24,410
防止呢一個噉嘅措，因為即係你你你知道，如果你唔放畀咧，到時一間又差後算賬嘅時候，佢誒喺香港嘅資產亦都畀人凍結等等。呢即係你有冇呢啲嘅考慮喺度？

105
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,190
畀著。

106
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:44,080
誒，我諗我哋當然係最主要係即係先去同呢啲內地嘅企業，或者有意嚟香港開先業務嘅嗰個企業去誒聯絡，同埋去話畀佢知我哋嗰個營商嘅環境。咁但係佢嚟到香港嘅時候咧，佢一定係要根據香港嘅嗰個誒。

107
00:24:44,360 --> 00:25:00,950
誒有關嘅法例，誒開公司啊，或者係誒呢個營商有關法例咧，係一定要按照呢啲法例咧，係去做佢哋嗰個誒營運嗰個誒準備嘅功夫嘅。噉啊，詳細嘅內容我睇下啊，處長有冇得有冇有冇補充？誒，處長有冇補充？

108
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:21,600
Well, the types of companies that we hope to bring from mainland are companies that are going to put substantial offices in Hong Kong, create jobs in Hong Kong. We're less interested in attracting companies that are simply using Hong Kong for a paper vehicle. And one of the reasons that we're getting so many business and professional service firms from around the world.

109
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:30,060
Wanting to come and also be based in Hong Kong, is that they want to support these mainland companies to make legitimate investments in their home economies.

110
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,470
啊！喺呢個，你喺你你你你點樣分流？即係一啲唔係做一啲所謂誒。

111
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,820
paper vehicle，即係，how do you differentiate？你 know啊？

112
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:48,420
such investment of simply paper vehicle，rather than you know substantial investments。

113
00:25:48,700 --> 00:26:02,010
因為 for us to claim a project, we have to actually assist a company to set up an office and to employ people in that office. Otherwise, we wouldn't count it in our statistics. So it's the actual support.

114
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,730
That that we provide is is quite important.

115
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:22,050
下位劉慧卿議員，啊主席啊，阿阿林建峯議員啊，而家走咗啊嚇，佢頭先提到有幾個問題咧，係可能啲人哋投資會關心，咁其中佢又為到佔中喎。

116
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:42,390
我我睇到其他嘅資料咧，就係對經濟冇咩影響嘅。唔知啊，秘書長或者處長有冇資料顯示咧？咁但係另外咧，多年來都係大家嗰啲外商比較關心咧，就係嗱空氣污染啦，誒唔夠學位啊，喺嗰啲誒外國學校嗰度啊，同埋啲租。

117
00:26:42,390 --> 00:27:02,400
金好貴啊！咁或者而而家呢幾樣都好似未曾解決曬喎，睇下阿秘書長點睇？咩嘅？係誒，多謝主席。或者我上次去誒回答議員有關嗰個誒國際學校啊，或者係嗰個誒空氣質素嘅問題。噉啊，有關即係個誒你揀答佔中先啦，好唔好啊？有冇你有冇資料顯示係有影響？

118
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:22,410
其實啊，處長舊年佢誒做呢一個佢嗰個誒年中嘅工作報告嘅時候，啊處長亦都係誒談及過呢個問題。等陣間我請個處長喺呢方面向大家誒解釋一下，即係誒佢喺佢喺佢同呢個外商嘅接觸裏邊呢件事呢，即係呢類事情嗰個誒嗰個誒情況係點樣樣誒國際學校嗰度。

119
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:42,420
冇錯，係誒誒，都係頭先所講，其實係喺誒投資推廣處嘅同事去引資嘅時候咧，係即係誒不少係提出過呢個問題。噉我誒教育局同埋我哋都係盡力去幫手去解決。咁純粹睇數字咧，其實過去呢幾年咧，嗰個國際學校嘅學位咧係有一個比較，即係都係有。

120
00:27:42,420 --> 00:28:02,430
穩穩定嘅上升，個學位嘅供應咧係有一個穩定嘅上升嘅。咁誒而誒教育局亦都盡量係鼓勵誒利用一啲新嘅呢個用地啊，或者係一啲誒空置咗嘅校舍咧，係批出嚟咧做呢個國際學校。咁如果係誒用呢個新嘅用地，或者係用一啲誒現有空

121
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:11,550
校舍改改建做呢個國際學校咧，其實教育局有個規定咧，就係要求嗰個誒誒辦學嘅當局咧，佢嘅學位咧係。

122
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:31,860
誒誒，提供唔少嘅百分之七十嘅學位係畀呢個誒非本地嘅學生嘅。咁呢方面，我哋亦都係希望係幫到即係喺嚟喺外國嚟香港投資啊，或者工作嘅人士，佢哋嗰個子女教育嘅需要。咁誒呢方面，我哋會同呢一個教育局同埋同呢一個誒誒呢一個。

123
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:51,870
即係誒外商嗰方面保持密切嘅聯絡，希望個誒情況係逐步咧係係能夠得到係舒緩誒。空氣個質素方面，亦都係大家都知道，即係其實特區政府喺呢幾年亦都喺誒尋求喺改善空氣質素嗰方面咧誒做咗唔少嘅措施誒。舊年嘅呢個財政預算案啊，或者今年嘅施政報告咧。

124
00:28:51,870 --> 00:29:11,880
裏面亦都有提過一啲措施，係希望進一步改善我哋嘅空氣質素。咁根據同事所講喺佢哋日誒日中同呢一個誒外商討論嘅時候咧，無論係國際學校又好，或者係呢個空氣質素嗰方面都好咧，其實嗰個擔心可能係可能已經係比以往嘅情況咧係舒緩咗少少，係證明呢方面嗰個問題咧係逐步咧誒得到。

125
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:30,950
好少少改善，但係我哋亦都係會繼續喺呢方面咧，係有一個誒，再要再做多啲功夫咧，令到即係外商對香嚟香港投資嘅時候咧，係少一啲佢本身嘅擔憂。咁有關個政治嘅誒環境對外商投資嘅信心啊等等，我請阿啊處長喺度向大家解釋一下。處長唔該。

126
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:48,020
基本上，當我們working with foreign companies， we're often account managing the decision makers in those companies for a number of years. So many of the companies that have set up last year， we would have started talking to three or four years before.

127
00:29:48,300 --> 00:30:01,260
因為外國直接投資有如此長的時間軸，我們沒有看到任何變化。在去年，香港有更多公司來設立，是因為佔中運動。

128
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:21,590
What we did see, though, of course, is that some of the companies that are already here had their business adversely impacted by the Occupy Central movement. And of course, we had a number of inquiries from companies that were planning to visit Hong Kong about how easy it would be to get around, how easy it would be to attend events, and we.

129
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:41,600
要試下嚟，要試下

130
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,840
有呢個政策嘅風險。

131
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:54,880
policy risk，咁呢個就係呢一幾年嘅啦，因為政府個政策咧係即係好突然間就改變啊，冇諮詢啊，呢個外商有冇呢啲噉嘅關注咧？

132
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,810
黐線。

133
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:18,690
Some of the some of the larger companies that are involved in infrastructure projects have expressed some concerns, but the vast majority of our clients are new to Hong Kong, and so they're not so involved in in coming to Hong Kong because of particular policy initiatives. They are too new, so they don't know.

134
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,520
你識我？

135
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,850
譬如好似對誒誒呢個。

136
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:36,070
雙重嗰個stand duty、double stand duty啊，嗰啲或者誒特別嗰個離印啊咁嗰啲，佢哋會唔會喺香港購置誒？

137
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,690
佢哋公司嘅物業啊，咁會唔會有擔心？

138
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,800
The vast majority of the companies that we bring into Hong Kong start by renting, so the stamp duty isn't an issue.

139
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,620
各位啊，廖長江議員。

140
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,400
Now I understand that Invest Hong Kong has been promoting Hong Kong as a

141
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,110
ideal FDI destination and has been.

142
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,790
encouraging overseas enterprises to come and start up here.

143
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,620
and all.

144
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,750
to expand the business here.

145
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,830
Now what what backup support service?

146
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,750
Do you offer to these?

147
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,580
foreign enterprises who decided to come here.

148
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,730
嗯。

149
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:37,720
Well, the honourable Jeffrey Lamb has raised a number of factors, including the shortage of international schools and so and so forth.

150
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,930
我唔諗我聽過滿意嘅答案，而且至少唔係今日。

151
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,930
Now，the particular question I want to ask.

152
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,260
In relation to backup services, that what

153
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,480
啊。

154
00:32:50,760 --> 00:33:00,270
methods or what offer have we provided to these enterprises in relation to recruitment of

155
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,060
哦，夫。

156
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,760
specialists and professionals, you know how how do we cater for their manpower needs?

157
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,940
記者。

158
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:22,170
Well, let me address the school places issue first because it's been raised by a number of members. Invest Hong Kong takes this issue very seriously, and within our department, we have colleagues that focus just on this issue.

159
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:30,080
On the one hand, we reach out to the international schools that are already here and offer help in any expansion plans they may have.

160
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:46,510
We also treat international schools that are looking to bid for the current sites that are available as projects, and we help them to try to come into Hong Kong. But also, we sit down with individual parents and advise them on their schooling options.

161
00:33:47,140 --> 00:34:07,150
This year we've actually had less enquiries and less problems in terms of the companies that we've been helping to set up with school places than we did the previous year. So we believe that the problem's still there, but it's not as acute as it was in 2013. And with the new schools that are coming online.

162
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,800
我們希望，這的供應會繼續來緩解這個問題，一啲。

163
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:32,120
There are a lot of very good schools in Hong Kong, but sometimes parents aren't aware of the new schools and the new the new facilities that are available. And we also make a point of talking to decision makers and people moving to Hong Kong well in advance of them moving here, so that they can choose the school.

164
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:43,600
Before perhaps they choose where they want to live. We do. We provide. We write letters of support. We provide advice and we take them to schools as well.

165
00:34:44,440 --> 00:35:04,450
In terms of the other things that we do, I mean, because it's a it's really an account management role that Invest Hong Kong has. In the early stages, when we're engaging with people overseas and on the mainland, it's about providing them with information and advice on what types, what part of their business is best suited to Hong Kong.

166
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:24,710
And then once a company is ready to set up and expand here, it's practical help—help with advising them on what is the right visa for their employees, help with finding the right service providers in Hong Kong, help with getting marketing and media coverage for their expansion. And then even after they've set up.

167
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,900
We try to provide them with some specialist networking opportunities to grow their business here and expand.

168
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:45,220
In terms of staffing, initially when they're coming in, of course we provide them with advice on on salary levels. But we also would signpost them to executive search firms if they're looking to engage professionals here.

169
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:57,750
Any more? Yes, can I follow? Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you very much for your answers. The other thing is, you know, I would like to ask.

170
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,260
That what in your opinion?

171
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:13,170
Would be the areas that we have come out short, and which require improvement in order to make your departments work more effective? Could you tell us that? Okay.

172
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,670
處長。

173
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,020
Okay. Well.

174
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:26,290
We we talked about a number of the challenges. I think one one thing that we would like to see. I mean, of course, we could do with more schools.

175
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:45,810
但但 we we believe we're moving in the right direction there. The other thing that is a little bit of a challenge for smaller companies is opening bank accounts. And again, we're working with the HKMA on this issue because that can also be a barrier to companies setting up and the time it takes to open bank accounts.

176
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,640
OK，我唔緊張。

177
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,280
好，阿張麗雲議。

178
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:08,180
好嘅，主席。嚇，我都想問下誒署長嗰邊咧，就係我睇到我哋有廿九個啊辦事處地點啦，而當中咧有部分嘅辦事處咧就係誒同呢個經貿辦黐埋嘅。

179
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,970
噉啊，有一啲咧就只係一個顧問公司。我想問下呢兩者之分係是什麼？

180
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,790
即係顧問公司同埋經貿辦。

181
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,330
即係顧問公司係咪係委託當地人去做嘢，定係點咧？係。

182
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:43,740
我誒多謝誒多謝主席，多謝議員嘅問題。或者我講誒講我答完之後，我請啊啊處長再補充誒。如果有顧問公司嘅地方咧，基本上就係即係嗰啲地方，我哋冇誒特區政府嘅嗰個誒經貿辦喺度噉，所以咧，但係我哋為為咗要保持嗰個誒網絡，為咗要。

183
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:58,950
即係擴大我哋嗰個招商個網引資個網絡咧，我哋喺一啲即係有潛力嘅地方，即使係冇香港特區政府嘅經貿辦嘅時候咧，我哋就會用呢一個聘請個當地顧問嘅公司嘅形式。誒呢方面嗰個實際嘅情況，我請阿處長同大家再解釋一下。

184
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,300
出張。

185
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:20,970
wherever we have government economic and trade offices in a market that is has a lot of potential for attracting FDI, we have small teams of normally locally engaged staff in those in those offices that reach out to to investors in the in that particular territory. Elsewhere in

186
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:30,040
Places like France and Italy, the Nordics and Korea, we engage part-time consultants. We give them performance-related targets.

187
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:50,330
和，我們會審視這些顧問每兩年，和選取他們在公開招聘基礎上，我們發現這是成本效益最高和最靈活的確保我們在這些市場有代表性的方法。好，咁另外我想知道咧，嗱就嗱過去呢幾年咧，其實有好多地。

188
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:56,420
地方個經濟發展麻麻地，譬如歐洲啊，經濟麻麻地嘅，咁咧就誒。

189
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:16,710
啊！我想知道，個啊啊呢個二零一四年咧，你哋係啊完成咗個項目三百五十五個啦。咁呢三百五十五個減去咗係內地有七十五個啦。噉啊，即是有二百八十九個、二百八十個係啊外地嘅嚇，即係香港啊、內地。

190
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:24,360
以外嘅地方嘅，噉我想問下呢二百八十九個嘅分佈喺誒邊度嚟咧？噉樣嚇。

191
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,420
誒，喺二百八十九個個分紅情況。

192
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:47,740
Well, the the second larger source would be the U.S. So forty four projects from the U.S. followed by the U.K. and Japan. But the one that's grown very fast is France. France is rank number five for the first time when we completed twenty five projects from France last year.

193
00:39:48,020 --> 00:40:08,030
所以，although the eurozone economies have been fairly flat, in some respects that's created a push factor. So smaller high-growth companies from the eurozone, particularly from France, from Italy, from Spain, have been expanding and moving into Asia in quite large numbers.

194
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:15,390
我想知舊，我想知二零一四年咧，野老撒冷同阿布扎比有冇嚟咧？

195
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,930
一四耶路撒冷同埋阿布達比有冇嚟香港投資？

196
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,140
We did. We did have some projects from Israel. Let me just check on the numbers.

197
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:47,820
阿何生想有嘢補充啊？或者我補充下嗰啲數據。誒，以色列係有嘅。喺二零一四年咧，我哋係有兩個嘅。喺亞布扎比嗰個顧問咧，其實佢係會睇亞聯遊。咁亞聯遊咧喺二零一四年咧，亦都係有兩個項目嚟咗香，即係係完成咗嘅。

198
00:40:50,020 --> 00:41:10,030
O.K.，多謝啊。其實啊，主席，我哋都好關心啊，即係我哋好想知道。第一就係啊，其實都好叻㗎啦。你一二即係二零一四年，你都有三百五十五個項目過嚟，因為另外因為而家就全球好多地方嘅經濟麻麻地啦之際，你都可以吸引到咁多個項目，係嘛？

199
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:21,160
咁咧，但係咧，即係我又始終我即係覺得咧，其實你哋有一啲工作係好重要嘅，好重要係乜嘢咧？嗱，我哋啊啊！

200
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,790
即係。

201
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,890
有句話就係叫做我做廠出身嘅。

202
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,960
就係market oriented好緊要。

203
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,800
嚇！即使係外邊嘅市場，佢哋。

204
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,430
尋求緊啲乜嘢嘢？

205
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,840
去投資，點解佢要嚟呢度？

206
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,110
你呢度有咩好？嚇，你一定要係。

207
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:54,870
有好多意見，你聽到翻嚟嘅嚇，咁咧就啊，即係好唔好啊？

208
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:15,260
即係將來能夠就呢方面咧，即係話而家係海外嗰啲啊，即係佢哋係啊，即係有興趣於邊方面，或者有啲乜嘢建議，因為你好重要話畀我啲立法會議員聽。即係我哋知道，因為你哋我哋知道嘅話，我哋亦都可以喺某。

209
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:35,270
某方面係同即係政府方面啊，或者係啊點樣支持佢多啲去發展嗰啲行業啊嘛嚇。即係譬如，其實我而家我仲冇一個數據，就係三百五十五個項目係咩咧？你話集中喺金融啊、科技啊、創意啊咁噉啊，各佔幾多咧？啱唔啱啊嚇？即係。

210
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:45,310
其實呢個唔可以就噉話金融一樣嘢，或者係錯誒誒科技一樣嘢去涵括好多嘢嘅。咁所以我哋希望能夠可唔可以以後多呢啲信息咧？

211
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,490
又多啲細分一啲。

212
00:42:48,770 --> 00:43:06,610
個行業分類，因為我哋好需要你係等於係我哋喺香，我哋日日都坐喺香港㗎嘛，我哋唔知外國嘅情況，但係你哋可能會收到好多料翻嚟噉樣嚇。啊，張議員就時間夠啦，我諗啊，要求局方嚇，下次將個資料詳細一啲。

213
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,850
啊，下位啊，劉偉興議。

214
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:29,270
主席，主席，我想跟進嗰啲國際學校嗰度咧，唔知誒阿阿邊先生，你知道嗰而家個情況係幾嚴峻？因為頭先佢講咧就話新嗰啲起嗰啲國際學校咧，就要求咧係誒，即係最即係要七成嗰啲位係畀啲誒非本地人啦。咁其實主席呢個都。

215
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:49,280
都好好麻煩，因為其實本地人咧係好多係派啲仔女去國際學校，因為佢哋對本地學校又不滿啦。嗰次我記得日本嗰個商會走到嚟我哋呢度開會講，就話叫我哋香港即係有啲好嘅學校畀本地人，令到佢啲家長就唔使派啲仔女去爭嗰啲國際學校啲位。

216
00:43:49,280 --> 00:44:08,480
咁呢個梗係唔關你事啊，秘書長，不過關政府事啦。咁但係如果真係仲唔夠位咧，呢個七成嗰個係咪有得調教，可以畀多啲即係外嚟嗰啲商人嗰啲仔女咧？亦話可能係誒教育局又會有好大反彈，你點掌握個情況咧？

217
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:25,440
決定權呢？間由局還畀你哋局啊！誒，多謝主席，多謝阿議員嘅問題同埋同埋意見。咁當然呢個國際學校嗰個主導誒，聽完主席所講，其實係教育局嗰方面嘅嘅佢哋主導嘅工作。但係即係誒，剛才阿處長亦都講過咧，就係。

218
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:45,810
特別係舊年咧，即係佢哋誒喺收入上漲嘅都嘅情況係，似乎個情況係比以往咧係即係改善咗少少。但係即係啊，議員剛才講嘅意見，譬如話嗰個非本地學生嗰個比例等等，喺啲新嘅新嘅國際學裏邊點樣處理咧？呢方面意見，我我哋好樂意交翻比較局去去佢哋去考慮嗰個可能性係點樣樣。

219
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,770
會唔會調整個三七比例？

220
00:44:48,250 --> 00:45:08,260
我我諗真係要呢呢方面真係要教育局即係嗰方面佢哋先比較即係更加清楚。林主席，你你問你問阿新加坡，好似新加坡咧呢方面嗰個政策就唔係比較高，因為你係國際學校啊嘛。其實你制定就係諗住係招呼嗰啲外國嚟嗰啲人嘅仔女，但係我哋而家就香。

221
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:28,270
好多政策啊，扭曲曬咁咧。其實國際學校就好多都係大部分本地人，亦都唔係佢哋嘅錯。啲家長係想啲仔女去啲好嘅學校啫嘛。即係我都唔係話想貶低本地學校啦。咁但係而家出咗呢個問題，咁所以咧噉佢又畀教育局教育局嘅，梗係就講教育㗎嘛。主席，我哋呢度咧就係講。

222
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:48,280
係吸引人嚟投資噉，我係聽無數商界講喂，我啲高級嗰啲人員，佢有啲好後生仔女，佢嚟到都冇書讀嘅，佢梗係唔會嚟啦。間公司都開唔成，咁即係要有啲人去處理中間啲矛盾啊。主席，你問佢，佢話比較嗰個，今日嗰邊得閒睇你啊，投資推廣啊，關佢咩事啫？關

223
00:45:48,280 --> 00:46:08,290
翻教育局，咁所以真係好撈教。我我諗局方可以強烈要求教育局喎。唉，我唔知點要求啊，唔呃住。即係過過嗰幾年，我哋睇得到個國際學校嘅誒數目啊等等，同埋個學位係都係有穩定嘅上升。呢個亦都反映到即係政府係睇得到，即係喺呢方面誒喺外商啊嚟香港。

224
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:28,300
講嘅時候嗰個需要，咁再加埋頭先，處長亦都解釋過，其實佢哋好主動嘅。每一次即係有有人向佢哋喺呢方面求助，或者就算個外商嚟香港之前，佢哋已經主動提出呢方面嗰個協助。咁誒，主席你講得好啱嘅，即係我哋再喺呢啲方面，即係我諗政府整體嚟講，再再加一把勁，希望個問題咧係可以得到改善。O.K.阿主席。

225
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:48,310
嗰啲國際學校又話六千幾個位，但係有啲係冇人想去嘅，大家都知道㗎啦，唔好攞啲數字嚟呃咯。我自己啊幾年前喺嗰個方便營商諮詢委員會，次次都傾到牙血都出埋，成日就話啊六千幾七千個位喎，有乜問題啊？咁啲人又話有幾間學校排曬大隊喎，排四年都入唔。

226
00:46:48,310 --> 00:47:08,320
到噉，所以嗰啲數字啊，秘書長你自己去了解下，你唔好同我哋講嗰啲啦。啊，留意員嗰啲國際學校有冇Band One、Band Two、Band Three嗰啲咁有冇分？梗係有啦，主席。所以有啲Band Three嗰啲冇人住多。咁咪就係咯，所以秘書長話好多位有鬼用咩？你有位都冇人去，有啲又地方喎，有啲話喺新界嗰啲人又唔肯去。

227
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:26,970
話要喺港島，其實個問題係比較複雜。李書長，你應該掌握到啦，就係從呢個即係吸引外商嚟嘅角度咧，即係政府要有一個即係政策咯，唔係冚唪唥畀曬教育局咁咁點搞啫？你而家你你而家成日話個問題好一啲啲，其實你都未必掌握到個問題，而家仲係幾嚴重。

228
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:33,530
聽到冇？O.K.到我有啲問題啦，我想問問咧。

229
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,110
第廿一段嗰，唔係廿二段嗰度咧。

230
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,270
嗯。

231
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:47,530
投資當處咧，喺九百五十六個項目裏面咧，就跟進咗三百一十一個啊！

232
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:55,430
其中咧就係有九成咧，仲喺度運作緊嘅。噉啊，換句話咧，就有一成咧。

233
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,630
而家情況係點咧？

234
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,340
我想了解下呢個第一個問題。

235
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,850
仲有咧，就關於第廿五段咧。

236
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:15,380
誒投資處咧就會喺呢一段時間咧，就以內地同埋東盟作為重點嘅市場。

237
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:29,120
我我我想問問咧，你哋啲資源上面分配係點樣樣咧？咁內地同東盟噉，你哋個資源分配會係個比例係幾多咧？

238
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,070
OK。

239
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:53,850
Okay, firstly the issue of tracking past projects. Our colleagues are constantly calling the companies that we've helped. Then after one year of operation and after two years of operation, to see if we can offer further support, but also to check that the company is still doing well in Hong Kong. And it's true.

240
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:13,860
That out of those projects during those three years, 10% could not be traced. So occasionally companies are not successful, they go out of business, or they're sold or merge with other businesses. And so it's understandable that we will see a 10% drop during that period. What's encouraging though is that the

241
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:23,180
公司們，我們從這個樣本進行調查，顯示整體上在那期間創建的就業崗位數量有所增加。

242
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:43,930
In terms of the mainland, the mainland's a major focus for us because in each one of the ETOs on the mainland, we have substantial teams, much larger teams than we would have in places like New York or London, and we have more full-time equivalent staff on.

243
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,750
在Mainland，  and in any other market around the world.

244
00:49:47,090 --> 00:50:07,100
When it comes to ASEAN, we have been focusing more on ASEAN in recent years. We have our team in the Singapore ETO, and as and when we have an additional ETO in ASEAN, we hope that there will be an Invest Hong Kong unit within that team, within that office, and that will.

245
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,530
會 significantly strengthen our presence in ASEAN too.

246
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:31,280
嗱，東盟咧，大家都知道係一個係一個成個誒好大嘅地域啦，裏面有好多國家啦。咁而家我哋投資推廣處咧，喺東盟成個範圍裏面咧，對於係邊一啲國家係比較重點作為誒？

247
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,580
工作嘅對象咧。

248
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:54,680
Well, traditionally Singapore. Singapore has been a major source of projects for us. So, and the fact that we have the Economic and Trade Office there and a team there means that Singapore is a significant source of projects. Malaysia is an is a market where we have a part time consultant. But looking forward, we want to put more emphasis on Indonesia.

249
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:09,340
We also believe that Thailand and the Philippines offer potential to attract a growing number of investors, and so we'll be doing investment promotion duty visits to all three of those markets, in addition to Malaysia and Singapore.

250
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,280
好，我哋各位委員有冇其他咩問題？

251
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,330
如果冇問題咧，就誒呢個。

252
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,800
事情咧就到呢度為止，好多謝各位。

253
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,920
噉我哋進入第議程第四項。

254
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,830
香港會議及展覽業嘅發展。

255
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,990
咁喺呢度咧，就係誒。

256
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,910
阿飛，度仲留喺度啊？係啱。

257
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,180
可能嚟咯。

258
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,110
係啊！歡迎啊，阿楊太嚇。

259
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,180
噉就誒。

260
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,520
嗯。

261
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,460
請貝主長介紹下有關文件。

262
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,640
多謝主席。誒。

263
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:21,930
誒，商務及經濟發展局局長其實喺上一次工商事務委員會會議嘅時候咧，誒當佢簡介呢一個施政報告嘅政策措施裏邊咧，佢已經提過咧，就係我哋而家係考慮緊喺灣仔咧，係興建新嘅會誒會議中心。咁所以喺誒今日呢個會議，我希望向呢個誒事務委員會咧係誒簡介誒。

264
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:27,540
香港未來對呢個誒會議展覽設施個需求，同埋政府喺呢方面嗰個跟進嘅工作。

265
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:46,740
咁誒，首先咧，我想向大家講講嗰個誒，我哋做咗有關個會展設施嘅需求嗰研究。噉我哋喺舊年係誒接納咗呢一個誒經濟發展委員會下嗰個會展及旅遊業工作小組嘅建議咧，係就呢個香港未來誒會議及展覽設施嘅需求咧，係展開咗呢個顧問嘅研究。

266
00:52:47,020 --> 00:53:07,030
誒顧問研業誒檢視咗誒全球，特別係亞太區同埋香港喺會議展覽呢方面嗰個發展嘅情況。咁顧問咧又覺得香港喺金融同埋專業服務嗰方面喺亞太區裏邊咧係有即係享負盛名，能夠帶動我哋會議會議業嘅發展。而香港嘅展覽業咧，亦都係穩健成熟。

267
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,020
因此咧，誒顧問咧係預計我哋嘅會展業咧，未來咧係會持續增長嘅。

268
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:32,310
咁誒，考慮到香港誒未來誒嘅預計嘅增長，同埋目前嗰個誒場地供應嘅情況咧，誒，我哋嘅顧問係估計香港去到二零二八年嘅時候咧，我哋係需要誒增加大概係十三萬二千平方米呢個誒會議同埋展覽嘅空間。

269
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,620
先係可以滿足到旺季嘅時候嗰個場地嘅需求。

270
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:49,850
咁由於呢一個誒增加或者係擴建嗰個場地嘅籌劃咧，係係需要一一段嘅時間。咁顧問參考咗唔同持份者嘅意見之後咧，係建議咧係我哋喺兩方面咧係要做功夫。

271
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:57,220
第一咧喺個短期嘅方面咧，我哋係要誒做一啲措施咧，係可以提高現有場地嗰個使用率。

272
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:05,400
而第二咧喺中長期而言咧，政府咧係要去上係去係要去盡力咧，係要增加呢個誒場地嗰個供應。

273
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:22,750
噉我哋大致上咧係同意呢個顧問個研究嘅結果同埋誒建議嘅。喺短期而言咧，我哋係會繼續誒政府係會繼續鼓勵有關嘅持份者，儘量去善用而家嗰個會展嘅設施，特別係喺即係旺季以外嘅時候。

274
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:37,490
噉我哋會係會繼續鼓勵呢個貿易發展局同埋其他誒嗰個會展活動籌辦機構咧，喺適當嘅情況之下咧，係繼續用嗰個一展兩地或者兩展兩地呢個方法咧，係去舉辦呢個誒展覽。

275
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:44,000
誒呢度其實有啲例子嘅，就係話，譬如誒由呢個私人營辦商主辦嘅。

276
00:54:44,310 --> 00:55:00,500
誒每一年九月喺呢個會展中心同埋喺呢個亞洲國際博覽館舉行嗰個珠寶展，同埋貿發局每一年喺三月份喺會展中心同埋亞博舉行嘅珠寶展咧，都係一展兩地或者係兩展兩地嘅一啲成功嘅例子。

277
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:20,790
咁另外咧，我哋係會繼續透過政府啊，同埋呢個場地嘅營運者同埋活動嘅籌辦機構嘅共同嗰個協調咧，係希望將一啲本來活動嗰個檔期咧係稍為去調整一下，令到旺季嘅時候咧係可以騰空更更加多時間咧係舉辦呢個展覽。其中一個成功嘅例子就係呢個巴塞爾藝術展。

278
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,340
所以。

279
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:41,800
咁誒中長期而言咧，喺新建嘅設施嘅方面咧，我哋係會考慮喺呢一個沙中線位於灣仔會展站嘅誒工程，大致上喺二零二零年嘅時候落落成嘅時候咧，我哋係會考慮咧喺呢個會展站嘅上蓋咧，係興建一個新嘅。

280
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,810
嘅會議嘅中心，咁誒。

281
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:53,400
我哋亦都喺呢方面咧，已已經係邀請咗旅遊發展局咧，係着手係就住呢就住呢個新嘅會議中心咧，係做嗰個規劃嘅工作。

282
00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:13,690
咁之外咧，我哋係會密切留意呢個大嶼山嘅發展，同埋市區會唔會有其他嘅地點咧，係可以適合發展呢一個會議同埋展覽嘅設施？咁當然有一個先決條件就係呢啲誒新嘅地點咧，佢本身係要具備有足夠嗰個配套嘅嘅呢個設施。啊，主席，我嘅簡介向大家簡介咧係。

283
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:21,300
誒到此為止，好誒歡迎各位議員提出意見同埋提出呢個誒問題，我哋好樂意去回答。多謝主席。

284
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,820
啊！而家報名。

285
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,960
個問題咧，呢就光見框框見同埋太見。

286
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,130
係長壽啊！劉華興兒，噉就誒。

287
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,570
嗱，我哋簡短啲，但係我因為人少咧，我就唔限時限啦，好唔好？

288
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,460
都係行路啊！好啦，噉啊五分鐘啊，過一間嘢。

289
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,950
你可唔可以對住個麥啊？聽到啊！

290
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:20,250
啊！誒誒，聽到啊！啊，多謝主席。誒誒，今日向大家簡介呢個新嘅誒喺呢個誒會展站上蓋興建呢個新嘅會議中心咧。其實同呢個誒所謂會展擴建第三期咧係唔同嘅。我哋今日講緊嘅就係喺未來呢個沙中線會展站嘅上蓋起一個新嘅會議中心。

291
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:40,260
咁至於呢個即係會展中心嘅所謂第三期嘅擴建嘅可行性咧，其實呢一個係一個比較難誒去呢個誒誒誒去考慮嘅問題。其實喺過去亦都有不少嘅討論。噉我哋亦都誒見過喺誒各方面咧有唔同嘅呢一個建議提出嚟。會展究竟係應唔應該或者係可唔可以去擴建呢個？

292
00:57:40,260 --> 00:58:00,270
第三期咁誒，要考慮嘅問題包括係，譬如話嗰個方案嘅可行性啊，對附近交通帶嚟嘅影響啊，同埋即係唔同時份者對呢個問題嗰個誒嘅呢一個考慮嘅意見，同埋咧即係個選址嘅問題等等。咁目前嚟講咧，我哋對呢一個即係誒誒誒所謂會展三。

293
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:17,480
其誒是否擴建咧？我哋未有一個定論，我哋係會密切注視嗰個即係會會展業嗰個發展咧。喺適當嘅時候咧，要睇睇呢個呢個問題咧。即係話簡單講啊，秘書長就係唔該開開麥啊！開咗，開咗，開咗。OK，就係嗰個啊。

294
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:38,350
而家嗰個會議會議中心咧係冇展覽嘅設施嘅。咁如果你話第時再可能擴建，如果真係擴建話，譬如做會展第三期嘅話咧，你會再考慮係咪有噉嘅需要？因為點解我咁問咧？就係政府咧喺誒一月三十號二零零三年嘅時候咧，當時嘅公

295
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:58,360
工商及科技局咧就出咗一個啊政策文件啊，裏邊咧好清楚就講明The government will carefully consider TDC's proposal on the Hong Kong CEC development啊啊Phase Number Three。咁咧，The policy of the government is that it will consider the question of support only if it is satisfied that there will be unmet

296
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:18,370
demand taking into account into earlier the additional one hundred thousand square metre exhibition space to be provided by the IEC and the timing of its availability。咁當時咧就係噉樣啊，嗰個政策就咁寫嘅。你可唔可以確認而家呢個政策仍然係失，即係仍然係局方嘅政策？

297
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:26,710
誒呢個仍然都係我哋即係考慮嗰個未來嗰個誒會議誒展覽設施嘅路向，其中我哋會考慮一個因素。

298
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,390
多謝主席。好，下一個係阿方剛副主任。

299
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,470
五年前。

300
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:54,210
將我哋自由黨咧，同埋我哋批發零售界咧，我哋係好支持政府，譬如積極即係擴展嗰個會議中心又好、會展中心又好。我覺得是但邊一範咧，都會帶嚟佢哋高消費嘅遊客嚟香港啊！佢會攞香港嗰個形象。

301
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,500
啊！呢啲噉嘅係會提升好多嘅。

302
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:04,540
咁但係我睇完咗呢個文件之後咧，一方面我又有啲我贊成咧，有方面我就係比較失望嘅。

303
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:19,100
誒政府，你啊，居然嚟請咗個顧問公司翻嚟個顧問公司啊，寫得好清楚，有短線有長線啦。咁短線嘅就希望你用使用個場地嗰個使用率提高佢啦。咁

304
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,150
但係，我想講講咧。

305
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:41,440
呢個提高呢個使用率唔係咁容易嘅，因為全世界呢啲展覽會咧，嗰啲檔期咧係每個行業咧係set死咗嘅。譬如你鐘錶業係咩時間喺香港開，咩時間係係瑞士開，即係定曬嘅。你突然間想改咧，係改唔到嘅。

306
01:00:41,610 --> 01:01:01,620
嗱，我哋啲製衣嘅一樣係噉樣樣，幾時喺巴黎開，幾時喺香港開，紐約開，識死所嘅，你好難話啊！我係個淡季嗰陣時咧，我不如畀你改啦噉，但係一改咧，你嗰個空檔一走咗咧，就冇得翻轉頭嘅，所以我想呢個短線要提高嘅使用率咧，唔係。

307
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:21,630
咁容易，除非你揾埋曬啲即係唔出名嘅展覽會噉啊得，係嘛？但係長線咧，你就話啊，嗰個顧問公司都話你而家就增長可能有四個percent嘅增長，但係你缺乏咧到二零二八年咧有十三萬二千米嘅個場地。

308
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:28,650
咁如果你到時到後，我哋二零二八年淨係做一個會議中心嘅話，連呢個場地都冇咧？

309
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,660
噉你呢個你呢個增長係去咗邊咧？噉。

310
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:39,590
咁仲有你畀咗咁多錢請個顧問公司翻嚟，你係聽啲又唔聽啲咧？

311
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:45,850
噉佢叫你係要有十三萬二千米喎，你而家邊有十三萬二千米啊？

312
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:56,920
頭先郭議員嘅問問咗你啦，你第三期個會展中心會唔會去做咧？噉我聽啊講咧，政府自自左噉樣又賴咗㗎啦已經，所以覺得。

313
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:17,210
即係你又畀咗咁多錢，你到尾又唔聽佢講，噉我想問問你到底用個顧問公司用咗幾多錢咧？係嘛？噉你而家話誒施政報告嗰度講咗二零二零年先至起灣仔嗰個地方，你起又要起幾年？哇！幾年落嚟，我哋香港同鄰近嗰啲。

314
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:37,220
周邊嘅城市，我哋對呢個呢個展覽業咧，我驚到時到後人哋已經爬曬我哋頭，我哋冇咗競爭力，唔正知嗰個展覽業有影響，我哋嘅我哋嘅零售、批發同埋嗰個旅遊業都好大影響啊！阿朱靜，我哋珠寶展搶翻。

315
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:49,330
翻嚟畀佢走嘅嘅又翻唔嚟，係啊！啊，李長，誒，多謝主席。誒，點樣去提供足夠嗰個回遷促嘅嘅設施，其實係我哋局工作一個好大嘅挑戰。

316
01:02:49,610 --> 01:03:09,620
亦都係我哋未即係未來工作一個即係一定要全力以赴嘅一個重點。議員擔心頭先提出嚟嘅情況，其實我哋都係誒擔心嘅。誒，我哋亦都係盡全力咧喺我哋誒嗰個即係客觀嘅限制底下咧，我哋盡全力去去處理呢個問題。誒顧問嗰個報告。

317
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:24,510
其實佢提出嘅建議，我哋大體上，我哋我哋接受，我哋認同，我哋我哋亦都係接受嘅。我剛才向大家所講嗰啲誒，無論係誒中長期或者短期嘅措施咧，都係即係同顧問畀我哋嘅建議咧，都係一脈相承嘅。咁誒。

318
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:44,800
議員頭先所講嘅嗰個誒，要人哋改個檔期，或者一一剪兩地、兩地兩兩剪兩地呢啲誒，不容易做得到。呢個我我哋亦都係明白。但係我哋誒提出嚟呢啲解決嘅方案咧，都係想即係儘量善用我哋現有嗰個財財場場地嘅資源。咁呢方面，我哋係要都係要有賴我哋自己同。

319
01:03:44,800 --> 01:04:04,810
同埋呢一個誒營辦商，同埋呢一個誒私人嗰啲誒誒誒嗰個誒誒展覽嘅嗰個籌辦商，我哋再去進一步去講，其實係有成功嘅例子嘅喺個當期嗰個互相遷就嗰度。我頭先提過個例子就係呢個巴塞爾藝術展，就係即係佢本來都係好想喺旺季三月份嚟嘅，但係初頭就因為個當期嘅問題，咁後嚟經過。

320
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:17,450
即係我哋幾方面嗰個劃船之後咧，係即係喺個誒當期嗰度稍微調整咗之後咧，佢亦都喺未來呢幾年咧係可以三月份一個即係展覽嘅旺季裏邊咧係可以嚟到香港。咁誒有一啲誒。

321
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:37,740
誒主題嘅展覽，譬如話講到啲誒時尚嘅產品啊、食品等等咧，佢唔一定係要喺旺季裏邊，或者喺個採購嘅高峯期裏邊嚟香港嘅。我哋亦都鼓勵佢咧喺其他時候嚟。噉我整體嚟講，我哋都係希望咧係喺嗰個成個成年裏邊嗰使用嘅嘅嘅率裏邊咧係比較平均一啲。噉我亦都係。

322
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:57,750
係會即係喺嗰個誒新會議中心個規劃嘅工作嗰度，我哋盡量加緊去做啦。我哋希望嗰個時間表裏邊咧，係喺我哋能力範圍裏邊咧，都係即係唔好嘥，即係都係冇浪費呢個一分一秒嘅。主席，我想跟進少少啫，即係個顧問公司已經講咗十三萬二千米嘅，噉你喺呢方面係政府係咪會聽？

323
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:17,760
佢咁講咧，一就唔聽咧。如果係聽嘅，你嘅十三萬二千米喺邊度落實咧？嗱，佢佢講緊呢一個嗱，佢誒顧問講講緊呢一個十三萬二千米咧，係去到二零二八年估計嗰個即係誒場地不足嘅誒嗰個情況噉。

324
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:37,770
噉我哋而家喺兩方面去睇，即係除咗呢個新嘅會議中心之外，我哋喺兩方面去睇嗰個誒點樣去增加嗰個場地嘅供應。第一咧就係大嶼山，大嶼山即係大家都知道係，亦都係政府一個重點睇緊要發展嘅地方。佢喺未來幾年，無論喺個交通嘅配套啊，誒喺個誒商業。

325
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:57,780
嘅設施啊、酒店等等咧，喺未來幾幾年咧會有啲即係不少新嘅計劃，或者係新嘅設施落成。咁日後大嶼山會係一個誒展覽一個好嘅一個地點。咁誒呢個亞洲博覽館喺過去幾年咧嗰個誒業務咧係有改善嘅。呢度即係亦都係即係誒多得呢個亞洲博覽館佢哋即係誒同事嗰。

326
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:17,790
個努力而冇有改善，佢一一定嘅基礎噉。如果大嶼山日後有足夠配套設施嘅時候咧，我哋對亞洲博覽館提供即係更加多呢一個誒會議展覽設施誒場地呢呢方面，我哋有信心。第二方面咧，喺市區一啲即係地方咧，我我哋亦都係盡我哋嘅力咧去睇睇有咩新嘅地方喺市區裏邊係可以劃出嚟。

327
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:28,160
做呢一個會議展覽嘅設施，咁希望咧誒逐漸係我哋將嗰個誒場地不足個情況咧，去到二零二八年呢個場地不足嘅情況，我哋希望逐漸逐漸係得到呢個改善。

328
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,940
下一位誒，現場嘉議。

329
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,050
我話。

330
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:52,340
跟得唔係好貼，但係都想問一問阿局阿秘書長咧，就係其實過往裏邊咧，我哋都聽過即係擴展嘅時候有好多個方案，即係好耐以前都提過咧，就喺呢一個灣仔個運動場嗰度做，佢意會唔肯啊？係我知，但係後來咧就就政府就話遷誒，即係點啊誒，搬遷個三。

331
01:06:52,340 --> 01:07:12,350
動咧個政府嗰個嘅誒誒政府嗰度嗰三座大樓啊，咁搬搬搬咗去之後咧就拆咗佢，然之後就喺上面起，即係有噉嘅傳聞啦，唔知真唔真。咁而家嘣嘣聲又整咗出嚟咧，就話咧個沙中線嘅上蓋噉樣樣，可唔可以比較幾個考慮，同埋即係求先方剛都提及到，喂噉你交唔交到條數㗎？做唔做足？

332
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:21,410
咁多架噉樣樣，咁呢度可唔可以比較下唔同嘅方案？除咗呢兩個之外，除咗呢一個而家最新個沙中線嗰個上蓋之外咧，有冇其他嘅考慮？

333
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:41,700
第二張係誒，多謝主席，多謝多謝議員嘅問題。咁而家我哋講緊三線換展換展站上蓋呢一個，又係一個新即係一個新嘅會議中心，主要都係作為呢個即係開會嘅用途。咁當然我哋希望有咗呢個新嘅會議中心之後，喺嗰度舉行會議之後咧，係可以騰空一啲地方出嚟咧。喺而家現有會展。

334
01:07:41,700 --> 01:08:01,710
中心裏邊，佢變咗多一啲地方去搞呢個展覽。誒，因為有呢個新嘅會議中心嘅呢個呢個特性。咁誒，其他嘅嘅新嘅會展嘅設施，我剛才答回答啊，方嘅議員嘅問題嘅時候，我亦都講過。而家我哋希望大嶼山未來嗰個發展嘅潛力，同埋市區有冇其他地方，我哋可以再睇睇嘅。咁會展三期嗰度，我剛才誒。

335
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:21,760
講嘅時候咧，亦都講過咧，就係其實大家有留意咧，就呢個問題喺呢個社會上一路都有好唔同嘅意見。大家對嗰個所謂會展三期擴展嗰個究竟個選址係點樣去處理啊？佢帶嚟個影響啊？誒，環保啊，或者對個海港誒海濱發展嗰度等等咧，其實有好多好唔同嘅意見。

336
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:41,770
誒誒，剛才主席都講過，區議會亦都有亦都有睇法。咁呢個問題係都係要好好好好小心處理。我哋係要即係目前嚟講喺呢個問題，我哋冇一冇未有未有好具體嘅結論，或者未有好具體嘅想法。我哋都係要繼續睇個情況點樣樣咧。誒誒，睇下譬如大嶼山嗰個發展係點樣樣，或者其他。

337
01:08:41,770 --> 01:09:01,780
市區有冇適當嘅地點啊？等等，然後先會即係對呢個問題有個比較清晰啲嘅掌握。多謝主席。我跟住一個咧，其實咁即時嗰三座政府大廈，即係而家係咪有個説法，都係話好似搬去九龍城啊？唔係，即係九龍東部啊。入境税務同法院係啦係啦，嗰三座嘢嗰三座嘢係咪即係？

338
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:21,790
佢有個説法就話，好似話搬去咧個東九龍啊嘛。好啊啊啊！主席誒，嗰三誒灣仔嗰三座政府大樓，其實誒逐步會有呢個誒部門咧喺嗰度遷出。但係誒，我嘅理解就係嗰三部嗰三座大樓嗰個日後嘅用途，最主要都係要用嚟增加嗰個甲級寫字樓個供應。

339
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:42,070
咁即係大家亦都知道，我哋即係面對好多客觀上嘅限制，我哋地方唔大，但係我哋社會上嗰個發展有好多唔同嘅需求。咁嗰三座嘅大樓而家誒部門逐步遷出之後咧，誒嗰個最主要嘅用途係攞嚟係即係作為呢個商業大廈嘅用途，係增加翻即係喺香港香港島呢方面嗰個嗰個即係。

340
01:09:42,070 --> 01:10:02,080
誒寫字樓嘅供應就同個會會展發展咧，就冇一個好即係直接嘅關係。即係係咪政府已經係內部已經傾咗，排除咗喺嗰三座大樓，即係如果假新佢重建又好，或者改用途都好，即係呢個呢個呢個可能性咧？暫時嚟講，我哋係即係冇計劃利用嗰三座大樓，即係。

341
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:18,480
做呢個誒會展嘅設施，咁其實即使嗱，因為如果你話沙中線嗰個上蓋咧，係愛嚟做會議中心，咁啱嘅，因為其實香港誒誒會議嘅場地係真係好缺乏，咁但係咧就展覽咧就好似阿方剛咁講，即係誒。

342
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:38,880
你而家頭先答阿方講就話啊大嶼山噉，但係問題就係老實實啦。我呢個委員會聽咧就成日都話點樣去幫呢個亞洲博覽做好啲嘅生意噉樣樣。噉佢哋咧嗌曬救命啊，就冇人肯去啊噉樣樣。係而家好咗啲啦，好啲，但係即係誒，即係以前嗌三下救命，而家嗌兩下半噉，即係嗰種咯。咁但係咧最近都冇乜點嗌。

343
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:58,890
因為而家變咗演唱會中心多嘅，即係呢一個展覽中心。誒誒，其實誒啊，主席誒，其實呢個亞博咧，佢過呢幾年咧嗰個整體嗰個業務係即係有上升嘅。各方面無論係展覽又好，誒開會又好，或者係其他嘅活動咧，嗰個數目都係有增加嘅。呢個反映到就係。

344
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:18,900
誒佢哋即係經過咗誒咁多年嚟嘅努力咧，誒喺行裏邊嘅地位啊，或者係佢喺個服務嘅方面咧，係越做越好。咁亦都係誒誒未來咧，我哋希望佢個誒營運情況係會更加誒好轉嘅時候咧，再加埋有足夠配套咧，我哋係可以會係可以積極考慮咧，佢下一步嗰個擴

345
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,600
嗰個擴建嘅計劃。

346
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:28,160
阿博都好似有擴建計劃，不過就拖住咗啫。好，阿位阿劉慧卿議員。

347
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,060
啊！主席啊！主席。

348
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:50,350
誒阿伯係即係應該係好咗啲人冇嚟冤我哋噉，咪成日冤住噉。其實冤我哋都啱嘅，因為因為佢冇生意啊嘛。噉你整嗰只大白象又係公堂嚟嘅，咁所以咧就最近我去物業發展局佢個時裝展覽嗰度，我都同佢哋講喎喂咁咪。

349
01:11:50,350 --> 01:12:10,360
你哋大家又如果佢有咁多生意，咁咪大家分啲畀佢哋咯嚇，可以一地兩戰啦，係嘛咁？所以咧就即係呢個係一個問題嚟㗎，秘書長，即係你揾咗咁多資源喺嗰度開咗嗰個地方，噉你一定要填滿佢啦。我唔理你演唱會又好，有啲喺度飲添喎，主席。

350
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:30,370
喺度擺酒係好嘅，不過最慘啊，百幾二百蚊車費喎，嗰度大件事喎，唔知係咪同港鐵有啲有啲安排？咁即係即係，但係議員提到咧，就話你啊個發展第幾期啊點啊噉啊？秘書長又話啊，我哋都冇咩誒冇乜共識㗎，冇乜唔知嗱，呢個就係個問。

351
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:31,160
係啊，主席。

352
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:51,630
你頭先都講未開場，你話我哋呢個委員會咧好多嘢都係好支持政府啊！阿黃榮真處長啊，又要再噏佢個名啊！嘿，佢話我哋都錫到佢窿啊！秘書長你學下佢啦，佢嚟到呢度啊，哇，風騷到不得了，個個都議員問佢哇，處長你夠唔夠錢使啊？點解你做得咁？

353
01:12:51,630 --> 01:13:11,640
少㗎，即係好多嘢，大家支持你哋嘅。噉你啊走去嚇，會唔會失時夾慢定咩噉樣？完全都冇人哋問你呢樣又唔得，嗰樣又唔得。噉你要去操作下先得嘅。阿秘書長，我知你新人上任，但係你就咁坐喺度，老實講，你等多十年都冇嘅喎。

354
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:31,690
你要同各方面啲人去傾去搞搞，真係如果唔係點發展咧？雖然有啲嘢係好蓬勃，但係唔會永遠都係咁㗎嘛。即係你呢度又有人阻住，嗰度有人唔肯，噉你去打通啲經脈先得㗎。秘書長，即係你係咪有開始咗做？有冇遇到困難咧？抑或等到咩？

355
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:40,000
二零幾多八喎？我頭先話畀郭榮亨聽，我我實唔喺度㗎啦嚇。咁但係好多人仲喺度㗎嘛。噉我哋點可以噉樣等咧？

356
01:13:40,910 --> 01:14:00,920
啊，秘書長係多謝主席。誒，頭先講過咧，就係點樣去增加呢個會展設施咧，係我哋工作一個好大嘅挑戰，亦都係一一個工作一個主要嘅重點。喺度可以向大家誒講清楚嘅就係，我哋一定係會全力全力以赴咧，係去即係誒，除咗係善用現有嘅設施之外咧，係點樣去揾一啲新嘅地方咧？

357
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:20,930
係發展呢個會展嘅設施，呢個係我哋誒會加緊去進行嘅工作。剛才議員提到亞博嗰度咧，冇錯，佢個業績係越嚟越好嘅。誒，議員亦都提過，即係亞博點樣去誒多啲同呢個誒文化發展局去去去合作，令到佢個業務方面亦都係有所改善。呢方面咧，誒兩兩誒兩個誒誒。

358
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:40,940
呢兩方面，誒亞博同埋誒呢個物業發展物業發展業其實喺過去幾年亦都有好良好嘅合作嘅關係。莫發哥喺過去呢幾年咧，喺亞博係亦都係舉舉辦咗誒超過四十場嘅呢個誒展覽，咁對呢個亞博嗰個整體業務嚟講，亦都係有幫助。噉我亦都好期望呢方面嗰個佢哋合作呢個方向咧，係。

359
01:14:40,940 --> 01:15:00,950
會繼續落去。誒有活動嘅時候去亞亞博嘅時候，其實如果有活動嘅時候，一個交通咧係會有特別安排嘅，令到去參加活動嘅人士嗰個即係往南亞博嘅交通嘅嗰方面咧係會係係儘量方便方便嘅。咁誒未來大嶼山同埋呢個市區揾呢個誒會議展覽嘅地方咧，我哋係會。

360
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:20,960
剛才議員所所講咧，即係我哋會盡量同唔同嘅涉困者去討論，睇睇佢哋意見係點樣樣咧。我哋希望盡快咧係有啲成果咧，係帶翻嚟話畀呢個事務委員會知。誒，議員對我哋嗰個誒期望同埋議員對我哋嗰個誒嗰個訴求，我哋係非常之清楚。我哋係會盡力去誒做好呢方面嗰嗰個工。

361
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:40,970
阿主席，你督促下佢哋啦，即係支持佢，佢又做唔到；唔支持佢，佢又做唔到，噉啊，即係冚唪唥都係窩火。我我諗有困難嘅，因為咧灣仔嗰度咧就除咗覓地困難之外咧，仲存在一個交通問題。噉啊，所以如果嗰度有困難，就揾第二道啦，主席。所以揾第二道咯，而家。

362
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:50,070
阿博嗰度咧，我知道咧，如果要搞活動咧，即係誒兩地一展嚇，一展翻嗰兩地咧，佢有收到不？

363
01:15:50,350 --> 01:16:09,370
安排佢已經嚇咁呢樣嘢咧，就我我諗啊，兄姐都落咗好大嘅力度，促進呢個誒會展同亞博嗰度嗰個溝通嚇。噉我哋都好多謝議員喺呢個過程裏邊，即係畀到我哋嗰個協助。

364
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,540
OK，唔係啊，張立議。

365
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,100
唔該，主席。

366
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:35,390
即係㗎，我咧就嗯想搞清楚一啲嘢啫。嗱，我哋喺啊特首施政報告咪話喺沙田有個上蓋啊，就會起一個會展嘅沙中線啊，沙中線沙田啊，沙中線灣仔噉啊，金鐘將沙中線灣仔站嘅上蓋。

367
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:55,400
啊！沙中線灣仔站就係呢一個會展站上蓋噉啊，起一個噉樣噉啊，就誒O K。咁然後大嶼山咧，咁咧就誒未來再而而家呢一呢個第三即係誒，即係而家新嘅會展計劃會唔會喺大？

368
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,720
大嶼山再擴大佢而家嘅面積咧。

369
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:03,310
誒大魚生，你講係邊度啊？阿博嗰度，阿博個頭嚇。

370
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:12,820
啊！B仔係，唔係啊，唔係啊，唔係唔係，因為點解咧？因為咧，我而家我睇到咧，就係即係。

371
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,230
唉，好多文件啊！對唔住，唔好意思啊。

372
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:19,070
咁咧就係誒。

373
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:35,690
即係話呢個誒會展咧，喺二零一三年咧，咁咧就因為場地不足，噉嘅推掉推掉了三十九宗租用場地，係咪咧？咁而阿博都好叻喎，佢都推咗十七單生意喎，係咪啊？

374
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:40,370
十七宗啊！申請啊！

375
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:44,430
嚇，場地不足啊！咁即係所以咧，而家你。

376
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:54,160
嚇！即所以而家我哋要再去揾誒，即係去擴展陣時，係咪要同時都要考慮下？

377
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,620
嗰個長遠發展咧，係咪？

378
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:18,470
啊，係，係，多謝主席。誒，冇錯，我諗議員即係講得好啱咧，就係誒今日向大家簡介喺呢個沙中線會展站嘅上蓋誒呢個興建呢個新嘅會議中心誒，同埋我我頭先所講，我哋係喺誒大嶼山啊，或者係誒呢個市區其他地方。

379
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:38,480
當去誒找尋呢個新嘅呢個回遷場地，呢啲都係誒我哋要應付嗰個回遷設施需求一啲中長期嘅措施。誒短期嘅措施就係即係向大家講過，就係譬如頭先主席亦都提過嘅所謂誒誒呢個誒一遷兩地或者兩地兩遷，利用。

380
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:58,490
善善善用呢一個誒亞博同埋呢一個誒會展中心而家現有嘅資源，呢啲呢啲就係個短期嘅措施。噉我哋希望誒呢啲即係呢幾方面嘅工作加加埋埋咧，係可以儘量咧係去追翻誒嗰個誒顧問所講話，我哋去到二零二八年咧，大概係欠缺十三萬平方米嘅會展嘅設施呢。

381
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,490
方面嘅情況。

382
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:06,280
阿主席啊，而家假如佢再起啲嘢嘅話咧，噉啊，使唔使嚟立法會攞錢㗎？

383
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,720
誒。

384
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:28,620
會展嗰度起嘢，嗱誒喺啊，主席財務安排方面。主席喺誒，如果講翻誒，目前我哋講緊嘅喺會展站嘅上蓋發展呢個新嘅會議中心咧，現階段咧，我哋係邀請咗貿易發展局去做個詳細嘅規劃。咁誒，究竟個日後嗰個設施？

385
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:48,630
嗰個財務安排點樣樣處理咧？我哋係想等到即係有個比較具體啲嘅建議，個嗰個誒詳細規劃去到某某一個階段比較成熟嘅時候咧，我到時我哋就會去審視究竟呢個新嘅會議中心嗰嗰個興建啊，或者係個財務安排點樣樣。咁如果係如果有需要嘅時候，當然一定係要要得到呢個立。

386
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,920
法會誒財務委員會嗰個誒通過先得啦。

387
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:58,130
因為誒，我記得誒會展嗰個業權咧都係差業主嘅，係政府嘅。

388
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,690
但係管理咧，就委託咗新世界。

389
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,170
O.K.

390
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:22,530
誒係啊，啊主席啊，誒而家你其實嗰個誒會展站個上蓋嗰度咧，其實嗰個項目定咗未㗎？未定咧係嘛？誒，其實誒沙湧線誒主席，沙湧線其實已經係定咗，沙湧線嗰個建造嘅工程咧，誒亦都係已經開始咗嘅。咁呢個沙湧線會展。

391
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:42,540
站嘅建築嘅工程咧，亦都係已經係開始咗嘅。不過咧，就係即係我哋亦都得到呢個路政處嘅協助咧。誒喺誒呢個沙湧線匯展站嘅建築嘅工程裏邊咧，佢哋係會做一啲即係做多啲嘅功夫。誒，譬如話喺誒周圍誒誒加多一啲裝柱，係誒可以咧。

392
01:20:42,540 --> 01:21:02,550
日後喺個上蓋起呢個誒會議中心嘅時候咧，係可以起起得到，即係話咧喺誒個會展站嘅嘅建築過程裏邊咧，已經係預留咗一啲工程咧，係方便日後咧喺上蓋興建呢一個新嘅會議中心。呢個新嘅會議中心係幾大規模啊？誒嗱，嗰個啊，主席誒，嗰個誒誒。

393
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:22,780
會展站誒誒攞嚟，我哋係誒規劃咗做一個所謂綜合發展區。呢個綜合發展區成個面積大概係有一萬六千五百平方米，但係裏邊咧有幾多係可以攞嚟做會議嘅用途咧？呢個就係有待而家我哋誒邀請某法局去做完個詳細規劃之後咧，先可以。

394
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:37,830
確實知得到，但係我哋亦都當然希望喺個詳細規劃嘅過程裏邊咧，誒能夠利用呢個一萬六千五百平方米嘅地方裏邊，係越盡量係用即係越多攞嚟做呢個會議會議嘅用途係越好啦。當然係。

395
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,560
嗯。

396
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,730
今日。

397
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:53,490
誒要提問嘅議員咧就問曬啦，我綜合大家嘅反應咧，對於會展喺沙中線。

398
01:21:54,250 --> 01:22:02,620
會展站上蓋發展一個會議中心咧，誒個意見咧係比較統一，係支持。

399
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:14,430
就今日都聽唔到有任何委員有反對聲音，嗯，反而咧就擔心將來我哋香港誒會展事業嘅發展。

400
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:19,040
唔能夠進一步嚇，咁點樣充分利用？

401
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:25,020
有關資源咧，去發展香港嘅誒會議展覽事業。

402
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,650
就唔能夠畀周邊地區咧。

403
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:33,340
個競爭咧超越我哋咧，就到嗰陣時就。

404
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,210
翻轉頭都難㗎啦！

405
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:53,140
噉我諗咧就誒，當局要留意到呢啲點嚇，噉啊唔好話淨係啊啊Jeff啊何啊啊馬鳳學有嘢問，好，你問啫。誒，冇冇意思誒，誒主席，因為啱去西九董事會開會，係係係，所以改翻翻你。

406
01:22:53,870 --> 01:23:13,880
誒呢個唔係我哋今日嘅誒誒題目，所以遲咗嚟噉啊！我我我其實想跟一個問題啫，即係我都好支持，即係話會繼續發展呢個展覽場地啦。但係我哋想問一問咧，即係呢一個新嘅計劃緊嘅場地咧，即係政府有冇考慮嗰個營運模式係點樣營運啊？即係我唔知頭先有冇。係啊，營運模式冇。

407
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:33,890
冇冇明㗎？啊，即係到底係係都係交畀私人去做啊，定係交畀而家嘅誒誒誒一啲誒已經係營運緊嘅嗱嗰個營運場地咧，就係沙中線會議站嘅上蓋。我知，係我知道係啦。噉就黐住而家灣仔嘅會議站啦。都都係就係想問翻嗰個即係。

408
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:39,340
運嗰個方式，啊，表象可唔可以簡單啲？係，誒，多謝主席，誒。

409
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:59,660
而家嗰個最主要嘅工作咧，就係係做嗰個誒新嘅會議中心本身個詳細嘅規劃。噉佢日後無論係個財務嘅安排啊，或者係個營運嘅誒嗰個安排咧，目前嚟講我哋咪有定論。我哋就想即係等嗰個詳細規劃去到即係成熟嘅時候咧，我哋到時先考慮嗰個財務安排。

410
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:09,110
同埋個即係最好個營運嘅安排係點樣樣？誒，但係到時一定係會向呢個委員會係會交代嗰個情況係點樣樣。即係而家咪有個取態嘅。

411
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,990
未未有定論。

412
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:31,890
誒梁君彥副主席有冇咩問題啊？冇咩問題，因為因為我講嘢，我又要declare我係誒務法局主誒嘅嘅委員啦。啊，咁所以你就唔敢講。噉啊，唔係咁可以講，即係我我諗誒，其實我哋即係政府都好落後㗎啦。即係喺會展個發展嗰度，因為講咁耐都。

413
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:51,900
啊，做唔到，同埋啊，事實上而家即係有好過冇咧，但係實際上個面積都唔係大嘅。係啊，啊個面積唔係大，唯一嘅好處就係同會展一期、二期又喺隔離，亦都啊個初步嘅諗法都會有天。

414
01:24:51,900 --> 01:25:11,160
橋啊，等等去啊，連接連接啊，因為依一個亦都幫到即係啊一期二期咧，一喺個沙中線嗰度一上去就可以行到去噉啊，方便噉。但係事實上有個唔好處咧，就係話你個沙中線都要二零二零。

415
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,020
個站址起得好。

416
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:25,260
咁二零二零咧，然後自開始起上蓋，起上蓋。咁所以你係講啊，二零二二零二三呢個最快脆。咁即係我哋講緊係八年。

417
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:32,970
最快八年之後咧，咁其實我哋周邊嘅地方咧都一路發展嘅。

418
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:53,260
噉我諗即係啊，即係政府睇睇，即係政府有咩辦法可以即係啊，做得快啲咧？咁其實好多嘢就話，如果能夠去沙中線起嗰陣時已經打曬裝，淨夠上蓋已經搞掂曬噉，咪容易啦。但係你有好多嘢仲要由頭嚟過嘅咧，就困難嘅同。

419
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,940
同埋你有已經有火車行緊，你至開始喐嘅困難，同埋好貴。

420
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,990
咁第二樣嘢就話。

421
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:11,990
就算即係你依一個而家做緊，但係喺中間依幾年，我哋有咩嘢可以去繼續可以啊？用軟件又好，硬件又好，點樣去提升我哋會展業嘅？

422
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:16,970
啊嘅競爭力咧，即係大家都好關心依樣嘢，睇下睇下政府。

423
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,100
有咩？

424
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:38,390
好嘅計劃。第二張大家都急切，你要發展喎。多謝主席。有冇計劃？呢個呢個期望係好好好明白，亦都好合理，亦都係我哋要繼續努力嘅呢個目標。噉就誒回回答翻誒議員剛才嘅問題咧。誒嗰個誒新。

425
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:58,400
嘅會議中心做緊詳細嘅規劃，噉我哋希望有咗詳細規劃嘅時候咧，究竟喺個工程個進度方各方面係咪可以再加快少少咧？我諗誒有住有咗詳細規劃嘅時候咧，我哋再喺嗰度盡力去探討嗰嗰個誒可能性。誒，議員亦都講得冇錯，其實喺個會展站嘅興建嘅過程裏邊咧，頭先講過咧，其實係已經係會做定一啲粵。

426
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:18,410
預備嘅工程，誒加結加多啲呢個周圍嘅倉儲咧，係以備日後嗰個新嘅會議中心嗰個誒落誒嗰個建築誒落誒攞嚟呢個誒使用啊噉樣。噉就誒中間啊喺呢個新嘅會議中心落成之前，中間嗰啲如所講嘅硬件、軟件啊等等咧，誒我哋亦都會繼續。

427
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,630
即係喺唔同嘅途徑，誒。

428
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:36,490
同唔同嘅嗰個營辦商，同埋唔同嘅呢個誒展商咧，我哋繼續努力去即係將嗰個檔期啊，或者係誒個長地長地使用嘅方法裏邊咧，希望係儘量咧係騰空騰空多啲時間出嚟咧，係做到更加多嘅展覽。多謝主席。

429
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:41,590
噉啊，今日會議咧總結嚟講咧，就可以叫。

430
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:51,240
我哋事務委員會咧，就對於會展發展沙中線呢個會展站上蓋。

431
01:27:51,520 --> 01:28:05,170
嗰個工程咧係表示支持，同埋咧希望你哋加速進行添。噉啊，仲有咧就係誒香港會議展覽嘅事業咧。

432
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:25,650
希望當局咧能夠更加尋求多啲方法嚇，去加速個發展嚇。就灣仔會展又好，大嶼山亞博又好，嗰個協同效應咧能夠更進一步發揮嚇。雖然係近。

433
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:43,570
年咧係有所改進，但係希望能夠更加發揮好啲啊！噉啊，大家委員係咪啊同意呢個結論？咁如果係嘅話咧，就其他事項就第五項議程，如果冇咧，就今日可以放學啦。
