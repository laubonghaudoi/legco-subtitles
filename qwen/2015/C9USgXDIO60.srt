42
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,970
請柏志高先生啦。

43
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:40,600
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year to all members. This agenda item seeks members' support for our proposal to create a supernumerary post of administrative officer, staff grade C, in the strategy division of Housing Department, with effect from the 1st of April of this year, for two years, to cope with the increased workload relating to the implementation

44
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,020
Implementation of the recommendations arising from the long-term housing strategy review.

45
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,330
當這項議題在上一次會議， held on the 2nd of December。

46
00:06:50,610 --> 00:07:02,860
2013成員 sought supplementary information on the duties and responsibilities of the proposed supervisory post, on the changes in staff establishment of THB, HD.

47
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:16,950
relevant information was provided to members for reference prior to the meeting, and I don't propose to go through that at this stage. But members perhaps should note that following the amalgamation of the then housing branch with housing department in mid two thousand and two.

48
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:32,310
There was a deletion of four posts. This was followed by further 24 posts following rationalisation of the department between 2002 and 2007. Since then, we've created.

49
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:40,900
13 posts at the directorate level，所以淨 deletion since 2002 is 15 directorate posts。

50
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,570
我 sure members are aware that the three-month public consultation period on LTHS ended on the two of December.

51
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:55,620
During the consultation period, the secretariat and members of the LTHS steering committee attended over 50 meetings with interested parties.

52
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:07,100
在同一期間，Some 800 written submissions were received. Views received covered a wide range of housing issues relating to policy and operational matters in respect of both public and private housing.

53
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:19,080
The steering committee has considered the feedback and is compiling a report to summarise the views collected for submission to the government for consideration, and this will be considered as government formulates its policy.

54
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,580
on the long-term housing strategy and other relevant measures.

55
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:32,630
如所解釋在上次會議，現時的長遠居屋策略分區將會解散，於三月二零一四年底。

56
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,990
其 primary function has been to provide secretariat support to the steering committee.

57
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:57,520
The proposed supernumerary AO staff grade C post holder and his dedicated team will play a key role in driving the government's response to the Long Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee report, including the essential coordinating work among different divisions in Housing Department, as well as with other relevant policy bureau and department, as they kick.

58
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:06,060
開始適當的政策審視， on a wide range of housing issues， with a view to complete necessary revisions to existing policy or measures in a timely manner.

59
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:17,140
Furthermore, the postholder will be responsible for setting up the framework for future reviews on the long-term housing strategy, in particular the annual review of the housing demand forecast.

60
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:30,780
我 have to say these are complicated issues, and the assistant director who is now heading the long-term housing strategy subdivision as a stopgap measure simply does not have the capacity to take on these duties on a long-term basis.

61
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:38,010
We have carefully considered if other AEDs in the housing department could be asked to absorb or share these additional duties.

62
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:47,870
但我們已來到結論，這不是 viable，，因為所有他們都已經完全拉伸，並沒有任何 spare 容量來擔負如此重大的任務。

63
00:09:48,190 --> 00:10:04,790
Indeed, since much of the additional work arising from both the long-term housing strategy review and new initiatives on housing announced by the government over the last two years has fallen on the other AEDs in housing department, they are all facing considerable pressure already.

64
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:18,030
我必須 therefore 諱求成員支持， for the creation of the proposed supernumerary AO staff grade C post for two years, to undertake the relevant work arising from the long-term housing strategy review. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

65
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:36,640
誒各位誒，因為呢份文件咧就係已經討論過，今日就提交補充資料，當會議都介紹咗啦。咁而家咧就我畀大家咧就係詢問，連問連答，連問連答三分鐘，因為今日議程比較多，好嘛？而家誒事宜想發問嘅有邊一位？

66
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,210
張超雄、李卓仁、張曼，哦，係副主席。

67
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,040
阿張志勇議員，三分鐘，你問你答。

68
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,920
好，多謝主席。就呢一個，而家房署想開設多幾個。

69
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,210
誒常額嘅首長級職位啦。

70
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:04,170
噉就話講緊係應付因為新建屋量嘅目標所產生嘅額外工作量，咁當然。

71
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,020
而家講緊係係咪呢一個？唔係啊，我對唔住。

72
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:29,310
啊！跟翻上次嗰個係係啊，你頭先噏個題目係下一個議程。O K，而家係先啊，噉樣我等下啊，好啊，李卓仁議員係多謝主席。就即係我覺得講嚟講去咧，當然即係都係想講翻歷史上以前係多人噉，而家已經誒減省咗好多人手。咁當然成件事本身就因為個。

73
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:46,920
長遠房屋策略而嚟，咁但係睇翻長遠房屋策略咧，咁坦白講又即係冇乜冇乜講嚟講去都係要揾多啲地去起樓嘅啫喎，一樣嘢就差唔多。然後又話即係第日咧，將來要誒即係六四比例啊咁嗰類。

74
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,130
但又睇唔到話有具體地。

75
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,860
迫切地。

76
00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:12,150
有啲乜嘢做啊？等間仲要講話啊，即係為咗應付一八至一九之後起多啲，咁又話要加人噉樣。但係呢一個真係睇唔到點解要加人咯，因為我睇唔到個長遠房屋策略裏邊有啲咩長遠房屋嘅策略係講完之後真係會會好即係落實去做嘅噉。

77
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:32,160
即係除咗，就當然佢有講建屋嗰方面啦。咁但係建屋嗰方面已經有第二個、第二，梗係要做㗎啦。嗰啲就咁同依個有關係，好似又睇唔到噉。我想問清楚，到底即係根本長遠房差率必一範係要加依個人去做啊？誒，請阿柏治高先生回答。In fact, there are many issues relating

78
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:52,170
Existing housing authority policy that need to be reviewed. For example, the well of tenant policy that needs to be reviewed. The QPS policy needs to be looked at. How do we deal with the numbers of young people that are applying? How do we deal with increasing the number of units that are available for young families? The HOS programme.

79
00:12:52,170 --> 00:13:12,180
There are a lot of issues arising from the long-term housing strategy review that need to be looked at and urgently. That's why we need the additional resources. 但係個問題係而家都有人睇依啲嘢㗎，唔況你而家冇人理嗰啲年輕人本身啊個上樓，而家都有一個。當然我哋批評咗好耐啦，年輕人根本排隊都排幾都排唔到。咁但係你。

80
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:32,190
呢啲全部而家有有咗人手做緊㗎嘛？嚇，點解又要額外整多個人去睇呢啲噉嘅政策咧？噉樣係啊，白志偉生。Mr. Chairman，the whole point is that those are existing policies that are being implemented by those ads. What we're talking about now is a review. We have to look at how the policies need to be changed. How should

81
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:41,580
They be modified to reflect the current situation. That's not something that any of my current ADs are working on. That's why this is new work that has to be undertaken.

82
00:13:41,860 --> 00:14:01,870
但係主席，我覺得即係如果你真係有新政策要去睇要去推行，咁頭先講嚟講去都係講咗年青人嗰樣嘢咧。但係年青人係咪真係你有新政策推行？我都睇唔到有新政策嗰度閉喎。當然你可以話我揾個人出嚟就睇下有冇新政策，但係睇下有冇新政策都唔代表有新政策。即係我哋真係。

83
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:21,880
佢希望係嗰個即係畀我哋睇到係長遠房產策略裏邊係有新政策要真係推行嘅，而係具體實質上已經準備做嘅。咁但係我而家聽唔到都係即係已經準備做，只不過我聽到嘅就係啊去研究點樣去做噉，即係係咪做噉啊？

84
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:41,890
嚇，好，副主席。嗯，Mr. Chairman，你你講下，你補充。It really isn't about just studying. We are have had the study of the issues. That was the whole purpose of the long-term housing strategy. Now we've got to move towards implementation. You have to come up with policies that are practical. You have to look at the process, and that involves

85
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:49,000
not just an internal paper exercise, but looking at the practical issues that need to be addressed. That's why you need people to be able to do that.

86
00:14:50,010 --> 00:15:04,890
啊，副主席，多謝主席。其實我都係跟進翻啊李翔議員所講嘅，因為睇翻長嘅房屋策略咧，如果講我哋講係年青人嘅係即係住房嘅問題咧，其實都係講緊話要將嗰個嘅係誒。

87
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:25,540
單身人士個計分制咧，就要係有一個下降，去到三十五分之上嗰啲咧，你哋都會係先作處理噉樣樣嘅。噉我唔知你所講嘅新嘅政策，就係講呢個部分嘅政策。但係如果係嘅話，其實同而家現有嘅政策有啲咩嘅特別嘅改變，會令到就係你需要呢個人手咧，呢個第一樣嘢。第二。

88
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:45,550
個就係話，就算我哋講緊係單身人士置業嘅安排都好，而家我哋講緊嘅係譬如居屋政策，都係一個即係一貫慣常用緊嘅方法。我睇唔到就係你喺個長者房屋策略裏邊有任何嘅説法係話會進一步有一啲嘅置業安排去令到係誒年青人嘅置業。

89
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:52,260
特別喺呢個居屋裏邊嘅置業嘅安排咧，有個唔同嘅處理。噉我想聽聽啊，即係。

90
00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:04,230
處長，你其實講一講，究竟其實係咩回事？有啲咩額外嘅工作令到係需要呢一個嘅係即係同事咧去處理長遠房屋策略裏邊嘅同房有關嘅部分。

91
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,400
阿邱生，Mr. Chairman，In fact。

92
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:28,170
I'll just give just one example. There are many different areas that we have to look at. QPS, well-off tenants would be another one, for example. Abuse of housing resources. All of these things need to be looked at. But let me just use the one that you've commented on. If you look at the suggestion that came out of the Public Accounts Committee, and that's the

93
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,740
suggestion was that we should take points off people for example for their educational attainment.

94
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:42,040
那 was very controversial. Just the fact that that was suggested, had already been very controversial.

95
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,480
The issue must be looked at in the main. You can't just say it's just one way to look at it.

96
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:55,680
所以，the purpose of having this sort of additional resources is to make sure that when we're looking at

97
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,060
一政策 area， we deal with all of the issues that arise from that policy area. now

98
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,920
In terms of the QPS, there are a number of issues that we have to look at. First, yes, it is young people.

99
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:18,990
但 is it simply possible for us to say that we take additional points off so that they become less competitive when it comes to the allocation of?

100
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,380
Singleton units through the QPS.

101
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:37,720
那係一個非常簡單嘅問題，但係問題出嚟嘅問題，作為我們從PIC聽證會所學到嘅，係非常複雜嘅，佢哋必須要考慮得非常仔細。我哋可以舉出例子喺呢啲其他領域，例如租客欺詐、富裕租客政策等等，但係你。

102
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:58,220
It's not just one area. It's a number of different areas. 主席，我諗我哋明白啊，柏志高先生所講嘅。不過我諗，如果佢真係想將呢份文件咧擺上去將來嘅人事編制嘅話咧，其實你都真係需要係將每一個嘅係細節，究竟嗰個係新增嘅即係誒編外職位係做啲咩工作咧，係具體係指出，同埋你都話到畀工。

103
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:13,150
仲聽就係你呢個職位其實係要肩負嘅係政策嘅路向睇嘅範圍係啲咩事情，我諗先有機會係即係大家會接受到。如果好似而家文件所講嘅話咧，其實我哋睇唔到就係嗰個職位嗰個實質需要係邊一樹啊，主席。

104
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,950
啊，兩國議員。

105
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,460
啊，啊唔係柏超先生，就補充你講。等我柏超幫補充埋先。

106
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:38,360
Mr. Chairman, absolutely, I accept that, and I believe that we have actually set out the the key areas in in both the previous paper and this paper that we feel need to be addressed. Of course, one of the issues and one of the difficulties I have is that the LTHS report

107
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:58,650
The final version of the report, including the final series of comments from the LTHS consultation exercise, hasn't yet been published. So I'm I'm a little bit constrained about the specific details that I'll have to address until that's been report has been completed and submitted to government. What I'm looking at is what I can already.

108
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,370
We anticipate there may be other issues that come out of that last phase of the report, but I take the point.

109
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,570
梁國雄議員。

110
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,730
主席。

111
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:28,200
即係你，如果你話你開開一個位係誒，好似人哋啲政制噉係不管部部長，即係乜都唔做嘅，淨係即係睇住曬啲嘢嘅，噉我都可以理解啊。但係你真係睇你佢你佢你而家你開呢個係人手唔夠，要睇住啲嘢啊嘛，或者話有個target，你有target，target for生。

112
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,780
噉你唔講，我哋點畀錢你咧？

113
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,570
呢個真係個問題嚟嘅，我明白你講咗好多嘢，哦，其實真係好複雜嘅。

114
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:48,070
咁咪化繁為簡咯，係咪？呢個真係一個你哋要去即係搭本，即係我哋呢個委員會嘅一個問題嚟嘅。我舉個例噉樣講，譬如講你話。

115
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,160
即係我叫啊，梁振英恢復租管噉樣。

116
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,120
噉佢咪租管專員，我梗係畀錢你啦，哥。

117
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,530
係咪研究下租管點啊？消滅劏房。

118
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,350
誒督導完咁咪督導消滅劏房，噉我梗係會做，即係畀錢你啦，係咪？

119
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,950
噉你而家唔係噉樣樣啊嘛！

120
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,630
係咪？咁而家。

121
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,940
你想我係點咧？就咁畀咗錢你，跟住你又去。

122
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,200
誒呢一個自己根據你嘅解釋去。

123
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,440
做嘢嗱，我我講呢樣嘢，我唔係生安白做。

124
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:31,080
好似嗰個佢最近整嗰個咩科技局噉樣，嗰啲話好啊，科技局一聽網民心意。

125
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,570
噉你做咩先得？個科技股。

126
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
係咪啊？即係舉個噉嘅例啊！

127
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:44,470
如果如果你政府唔有講清楚，我哋係好難畀錢你，因為你個你個你個你嗰個成績太差。

128
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:58,990
即係嗱，我舉個例啊！如果畀錢你開科技股，噉我點知你發牌會？即係嗰次發牌已經搞成咁啦，噉你仲整個科技股，可能係即係會更加差嘅喎。嗱，所以喺呢一點上面咧。

129
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,860
我希望你一陣間畀畀啲時間，我我我盡力畀時間佢。

130
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,860
你不如講一講。

131
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,980
到底係有邊個梁振英嘅政策？

132
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:25,080
係要落實嘅，你講講出嚟好過啦。潘兆餘先生嚇，Mr. Chairman，in fact，the honourable members touched on areas which I haven't yet really had a chance to talk to talk about，but you know。

133
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,330
There are both.

134
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:47,860
Internal housing department issues and I've talked about those QPS review of well-off tenants and external issues relating to subdivided units, relating to issues that that have been raised during the consultation process about rent control. Yes, about tenancy protection. Yes, these are issues that have all been raised. I can't give you an answer on.

135
00:21:47,860 --> 00:22:02,330
因為最終報告還未發出，但我想告訴各位，一旦報告出來，各位將會期待我們迅速作出合適的回應。

136
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:12,330
我 want to do that， but if I don't have the resources to take it， then frankly I have to prioritise and it will take time to get all done。你咪等個報告出咗嚟先。

137
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,210
誒國家奇遇。

138
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:34,510
主席即係嗱，其實我哋好想你有人咧去做嘢嘅。主席點會唔想啊？而家個個都等緊上樓係嘛？即係個個都覺得無論公屋又好或者居屋又好，嗰個建屋量都達唔到指標。問題就係你一個文件嗰度嚇，你文件都寫得好清楚㗎啦。呢個開呢個職位咧，係喺個文件十十一十二。

139
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:54,900
同埋十三主要咧都係就翻呢個長策嘅諮詢。主席咧，呢條長策嘅諮詢咧，政府都開咗會啦，即係第一次嗰個回應都講咗嚟啦。第一嗰個比例又唔變，第二建屋量又唔變，仲要係十年，即係令到公眾好大嘅失望嘅。咁要。

140
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,890
如果呢啲嘢你已經完全都唔變啦，都冇冇任何嘅回回轉，亦都冇承諾。

141
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:21,180
係會增加個建屋量，咁啲地又唔係你做出嚟嘅，又話係發展局去做，咁其實加咗落去咧都係坐喺度等嘅啫。咁咁預期坐喺度等嘅，亦都嘥咗個嗰個即係年資極深嘅丙級公務員喺度，係咪喺度嘥時間？不如喺其他個部門做做多啲嘢，會唔會好啲咧？噉你有冇？

142
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,810
嗰啲説服力，又有説服嘅理據，話到畀我哋聽咧。

143
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,760
畀咗呢個位，延續呢個位，佢係真係。

144
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,340
起碼承諾到嗰個建屋量會增加。

145
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,420
完成嗰個建屋個目標會褪前。

146
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,560
居屋或者公屋。

147
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:52,090
嗰個建屋嗰個指標咧，會提早達到呢個咁簡單嘅嘢，係咪同呢個價位有關？啊，白小姐啊，嗯，Mr. Chairman，I'm quite happy to say that if I have the resources。

148
00:23:52,370 --> 00:24:10,360
Of course, we will make every effort to ensure that not only do we achieve the targets that we currently have, but any new targets that arise out of the public long-term housing strategy review. That's the whole purpose of coming for resources. You've got to have both the land, the manpower and the financial resources. If I have those, yes.

149
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:30,650
啊！主席嗱，你寫咗落去，不過當然呢啲通常都唔會認數㗎啦。我就想你畀一個具體嘅數字。你話個建屋量會加咗幾多咧？有冇百分比咧？褪前係前咗幾多咧？咁噉我寫落去個會議記錄，咁到時都可以，就算你老人家唔喺度，你個接手人都可以同佢講，當年百。

150
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:50,660
高先生一月六號喺個會嗰度承諾咗呢個位咧，畀佢之後咧，第一嗰個建築量建屋量咧會增加咗幾多，畀幾多百分率？第二嗰個指標會早咗幾耐啊？係嘛？我完全同意嘅。我哋好希望房署或者房屋局咧係更加多啲嘢樓出嚟嘅。柏超生。

151
00:24:50,660 --> 00:25:02,240
Mr. Chairman, of course, that's a matter for government to decide once the report is issued. I've said that repeatedly. I don't have the final version of the report. In any case, this post isn't dealing with housing production.

152
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:18,460
This post, as it's clearly explained in the paper, is dealing with the review of policy on things like allocation, on things like subdivided units, on things like well-off tenants and what have you. This post doesn't deal with land with land supply or the housing production or construction.

153
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:33,710
There is a difference. Having said that, I've made a very firm statement here that if we're given the resources on those sides, we will work as fast and as quickly as we can to produce the numbers that we know the community wants. That's why we're we're here.

154
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,520
你講。

155
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
呢個輪椅。

156
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:51,870
啊，多謝主席。主席開呢個位咧，其實即係正如話睇到啊，白兆耀先生同其他議員講嘅咧，同埋文件十二段咧，即係都講咗嗰個重要性。咁呢個咧就真係好難去爭議嘅嚇。咁但係我真係我想問一個問題，就係即係啊。

157
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,730
誒誒誒誒。

158
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,720
處長，你覺得呢個位如果你唔開？

159
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:17,010
有啲咩做唔到咧？咁文件冇交代嘅，只係話啊呢個位咧，執二段裏邊咧就講咗咧，佢要可以統籌啊，睇翻嗰啲政策點樣樣啊。咁即係如果你唔開嘅時間，即係現行你嗰個誒房屋署裏邊內部嘅統籌，咁仲有啲咩做唔到嘅咧？咁咁另外一個，你就係重複講緊嘅嗰個長策會嘅報告未出，所以好多嘢咧。

160
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:37,020
就係未必咧，係你而家階段睇到嘅噉。咁但係長策，中期報告又出咗咯喎。咁其實整個即係報告裏邊嘅中期嘅報告，同佢即係報告即係最終嘅報告唔知咩事㗎。不過就係即係喺呢一度嘅時間，呢個位點樣幫到將呢個中期報告裏邊一啲嘢可以落實之餘，同埋就係話即係喺整個政

161
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
策裏邊。

162
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:58,310
其實佢有啲乜嘢係可以幫到手落實到呢個政策嘅咧？咁可以交代到，起碼等我哋即係會誒心安嚇，畀到錢出嚟咧，真係做到個嘢啦。咁當然啦，就係即係而家做法就係話畀住錢先開咗位，先先再做嘢啦。咁即係呢啲噉樣嘅嘢，可唔可以有啲表列嘅形式之後補翻，或者而家可以講少少咧？咁唔該，主席。阿白兆先生。

163
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,430
Mr. Chairman, I think it would be wrong of me to say nothing could be done if we didn't have those posts. That's not the position.

164
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:24,720
What will happen is that we will not be able to take forward these reviews as quickly as we think the community wants, and indeed as we expect members want us to. I will have to ask my other existing directorate colleagues to take on the extra work, which means that either we prioritise this work, or we prioritise their existing work. Something has

165
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:44,730
但係，我...我

166
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:50,910
Nothing else will have to slow down. So this is not a zero-sum game. I'm afraid this work has to be done.

167
00:27:51,300 --> 00:28:11,310
啊，主席，咁即係我有啲時間啦。咁其實喺嚟緊嗰個財委文件，可唔可以講到一啲就係話，哦，咁呢個位其實你幫緊嗰個長策會報告裏邊中期報告啊，或者嚟嚟緊預見到有啲噉嘅咩政策，你可以幫到佢檢討，幫佢盡快落實到報告可以做到嘅咧？噉你可唔可以可以即係之後補翻資料上嚟？阿李國麟議員咧就話：你可？

168
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:26,210
唔可以列個清單。李國麟議員其實幫緊你，即係你。如果你列呢個，呢個你講啊，主席啊，係啊，我我係我講嘅。其實佢係幫助咧，佢理解嗰個問題。噉你可唔可以列個清單，但係大家更加清晰嘅咧？

169
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:40,420
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, what what I propose is I I'll go through the interim report as as the honourable member suggested and extract those issues which have been raised and which I understand the community expects us to take action and list them out. Of course.

170
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,980
That has to be predicated on the understanding. It depends on the final report from the members, but I can do that certainly.

171
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,690
你幾時可以列個清單出嚟咧？

172
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,290
We'll do it as quickly as we can, Mr. Chairman.

173
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,190
within the next week or so.

174
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,490
誒。

175
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:20,140
假如今日通過交人事編制，假如啊，噉你係咪可以頭先你講一個星期之內咧？噉你盡快將個清單交畀大家啦。要即係喺佢人事編制之前咧，就睇到你嗰個工作目標清單清楚啦。嗬，得阿白兆生係點頭示意同意嘅。葉國謙議員。

176
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:40,920
誒，多謝主席。即係其實咧，我哋睇到而家誒政府咧，好希望喺而家嘅房屋問題上邊咧，係能夠得到誒滿足。而家我哋市民喺房屋嘅要求，我哋自己亦係好希望咧，我嘅公共嘅房屋咧，即係包括咗居屋啊，或者係。

177
00:29:40,920 --> 00:30:00,930
喺呢個公營房屋，即係出租公屋嚟講，都能夠有一個比較更多喺方面能夠滿足我哋而家市民。咁所以咧喺客觀上面睇翻而家成個房即係房署方面嘅嗰個同過往嘅人數同現足嘅人數，佢比較即係話，在之前喺居屋停建。

178
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:20,940
之前同停建之後嘅人手咧，我覺得即係喺嘅數目上邊係明顯嘅咧，即係有依一個噉樣嘅需求。佢即係從依個整體咁講。不過，但係從民警方面咧，亦係確實即係你只係提及到咧係會同誒依個長策有關，仲有一個執行其他任務有關。

179
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:40,950
呢啲噉樣嘅具體方面咧，亦可能係未能夠畀我哋議員能夠知悉，啲實際上邊呢方面工作進展。頭先啊啊啊處長你本身嚟講用咗好多亦好耐嘅嘅嘅方式，或者各種不不同嘅方式咧表達法，即係呢個一定係會嚟緊嘅，會係有有一個好即係較。

180
00:30:40,950 --> 00:31:00,960
為誒多幾種工作上嘅嗰個工作量啊，噉我我亦好高興聽到咧，你即係話會喺盡快能夠畀翻一啲嘅具體，事實上咧，升報告好快就會即係會喺我哋本會裏邊咧係係係呢個即係行政長官嚟在呢方面嘅報告㗎啦，噉我覺得即係。

181
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:20,970
我希望，如果先報告好，可能佢更加展示出一個我哋未來長房屋方面嘅嗰個嗰個一啲好具體嘅嘢。喺咁情況之下咧，我即係誒期望咧，或者即係今日我哋係一個政策啊事務委員會啦。咁而我亦都希望，即係如果你有機會去到啊。

182
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:40,980
嗱，嗰個依個依個人力編制嗰度咧，亦應該去提交啲比較具體嘅工作。我相信會畀我哋議員嚟講咧，喺依方面咧係會比較容易咧，係即係作出依方面決定。即係我覺得嚟講咧，即係喺喺今日嚟講，我係支持你啊喺依方面咧係係先係就依方面咧提出。

183
00:31:40,980 --> 00:32:00,990
出嚟噉，事實上咧，亦要個人事編制以及財務委員會嘅噉，我誒嘅前提嚟講，就你應該要儘快分畀出具體嘅工作咁嚟講咧，就可以息我哋大家之間，我哋議員之間嘅嗰個疑團咯。秘書長剛才講咧，係一個星期之內咧就會交你嘅清單。白先生，你有咩補充？誒，嗱，我。

184
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,450
Take the members' points, and we will provide that information before the ESC meeting.

185
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,490
thank you.

186
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:24,520
誒接住係阿盧偉國議員。誒，多謝主席。好快嚇，因為第一咧就我都要申報，因為我係誒房屋委員會裏邊嘅建築同埋投標兩個小組委員會嘅成員。咁當然呢啲工作都係義務性質嚇，冇金錢上嘅報酬嘅。

187
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,630
就。

188
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:45,920
誒，其實雖然咧，頭先都有議員同事咧，就都即係表示對於呢個長遠房屋政策咧，就未必話好滿意，因為的確誒喺個房屋興建方面要增加無論公屋私樓咧，短期嘅板斧實際上唔係太多，但係咧政府都係有做嘢嘅，噉啊更加。

189
00:32:45,920 --> 00:33:05,930
重要咧就係一路中期、長期嚇，即係將來即係香港點樣成為一個真係香港人能夠樂業安居嘅地方咧，有好多嘢可以做。咁雖然咧係我哋都係誒，即係期待嚇有多啲嘅細節嘅資料畀我哋提供畀我哋。不過咧原則上咧，我係。

190
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:25,940
支持嚇增加呢個職位，因為對於市民嚟講，即係如果個團隊裏邊係適當地增加成員，係能夠解決到香港嘅誒長遠嘅住屋問題咧。其實呢個好值得花嘅。所以咧，對於今日誒除咗呢個議案之後，其實跟住下邊有一個咧，對於具體一啲誒專業方面嘅委。

191
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,930
睇開咧，其實我都係支持，不過就誒，所以冇冇問題。主要我表示個態度啫，多謝。

192
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:52,260
第一輪仲有冇員想發問？若係阿梁耀忠議員，主席，其實咧就誒，正如好多同事都係咁講咧，就如果你真係能夠可以幫到成個社會，能夠增加建屋量，能夠可以解決到呢個住屋問題嘅話咧，你增加人手，我哋大家都好難反對嘅。

193
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,400
但問題在於就係一直以嚟咧，政府話畀我聽咧，唔係爭人手喎，係爭地喎。

194
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:14,910
而家係問題係要解決地嘅問題，重要過係起起樓喎。因為你冇地，你點起唔到樓啊嘛？係咪？我哋不斷都講話咧，就係話我要求三萬五嘅一個嘅公屋房屋量噉樣樣，你都答應唔到我哋做一樣嘢。噉我覺得你冇地咁揾咁多人嚟做乜嘢？都冇，都唔使起樓。

195
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:35,290
啊！我先啦，所以依個問題咧，我我覺得雞同雞蛋嘅問題。如果你依個雞你解決唔到，你用蛋點樣樣咧？邊個係先？邊個係後咧？你要你要即係回答問題先咯，主席唔該。誒，柏章先生。嗯，Mr. Chairman，we we are actually coming back um slightly later in this meeting on post for the production side.

196
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:42,450
This post doesn't deal with the land production or the housing production, but let me just deal with the general point that the honourable members quite rightly pointed out.

197
00:34:43,050 --> 00:35:03,060
In order to increase production, you need land definitely, but you also need the other resources that go with that. You need the manpower to do the construction, to do the design, to do the infrastructure development and so on. You also need the financial resources to be able to do that. So it's it's all three elements have to be in place to.

198
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:23,070
to allow for any increase in production. Now, over the last two years, we've come to seek members' approval for the increase in our manpower, and indeed we've we've managed with member support to increase our manpower, but primarily and effectively on the construction side. That was for the production.

199
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,560
用額外資源。

200
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:44,940
We will have to continue to do that, depending on how large the target that we're given. At the moment, the targets are are set at twenty thousand units of public rental housing, plus seventeen thousand HOS, plus five thousand per annum thereafter. But if there is an increase on that, we will have to look for more more manpower.

201
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,080
嗱，那係just within the housing department。

202
00:35:47,540 --> 00:36:07,550
The construction industry also has a manpower shortage, as members are well aware, I'm sure, and that needs to be addressed as well. And that's something that Development Bureau and ourselves, we are working very hard to look at how we can increase the size of the manpower in the construction industry as a whole. Because again, if we're putting more demand on that construction.

203
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:27,560
industry, we need the resources in the industry to cope. So I think the honourable member is absolutely right. Manpower is as important as the land supply. But to come back to this paper, this paper is looking at the requirements for policy reviews within the bureau and the department in respect of housing policies. 主席，但係未攞幾。

204
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:46,130
幾年咧個增建嘅公屋量咧，同以前咧嗰個個公屋量咧係相差無幾喎。以前係一萬五千個單位，咁而家你最多你兩萬七千個平均都唔夠嘅話咧，你點解同我哋講就係以前夠人手去起起樓，而家就唔夠人手起樓咧？除非你增加個公屋量啫嘛，係咪先啦？

205
00:36:46,910 --> 00:37:06,920
again, Mr. Chairman, the targets have been increased. You may recall that the original target was fifteen thousand just on public rental housing. We were then asked to increase that to twenty thousand per annum on public rental housing plus home ownership schemes. Initially, a lump of seventeen thousand and then five thousand.

206
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:24,480
per annum on home ownership scheme. So we've been gearing up for that. What I'm anticipating is that there will be a further increase arising from the long-term housing strategy review. And if that happens, then I need to gear up for that. But that's something for the future. At the moment, I'm trying to look at what I need right now.

207
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,830
誒第一輪就完啦，而家請第二輪咧，係阿副主席，仲有啲簡短問題想問。

208
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,190
係胡志偉議員，其實都好簡單，我想問翻咧，因為誒。

209
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:49,290
秘書長講幾次咧，其實短期嘅問題都係要等到即係長遠房屋策略有個five report之後咧，先至真係知道究竟具體個工作係點樣樣。而家冚唪唥都anticipated，即係一個預期有嘅工作。

210
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:56,070
誒換言之，其實就冇一個迫切性咧，要喺今天就一定要得到呢一個嘅係即係職位。

211
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,190
我想問下啊，秘書長就係。

212
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:19,480
其實呢個職位可唔可以，或者你講畀我哋聽個迫切性喺邊一度？當你其實具體嘅工作都要等到個長遠房屋拆落嘅翻翻屋report出咗嚟之後，你先至能夠係即係真正係點示得出嚟，係咪可以？即係我哋其實原則上大家同意要加人手嘅，只不過就係都想聽到或者睇到就話具體嘅工作嘅。

213
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,580
內容範圍係咪可以等到長策嘅？

214
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:28,280
終極報告出咗嚟之後，先至係作為呢個人手提升嘅一個係時間表咧。多謝主席。

215
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:48,570
Mr. Chairman, I don't believe that's the appropriate way to do it because the work can start as soon as we get the manpower. We know that there are certain very firm recommendations already arising from the consultation exercise. We know that we're already working on the final report. So the sooner I get

216
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:54,560
manpower in place, the sooner I can start this process. That's why we're trying to advance this exercise.

217
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:15,280
The uncertainty comes from the fact that I don't know exactly what the final report will say. I can tell you there will be issues in that report dealing with review of QPS, review of the long-term annual review of the long-term housing demand forecast, well-off tenants etc. Those things definitely will be.

218
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:35,290
We know that already. What I don't have the detail is the final product of what government accepts as the global recommendations. So there's no issue here that this work is going to be in any way nugatory. It will be necessary for us to get working, and I believe that the community expects us to get working as soon as we possible.

219
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,100
That's why we're pushing ahead as soon as we can.

220
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:56,310
誒呢個討論咧就已經誒過咗鐘十幾分鐘㗎啦，咁咧就我想問一問各位咧，就係是否同意呢份文件咧，就係交去呢個誒人力人事編制小組委員會考慮。

221
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,380
噉啊！大家都表示冇反對，噉就同意啦。咁而佢下一個議程。

222
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:10,490
第五個議程就係一手住宅物業銷售監管局嘅工作。

223
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:22,550
立法會C B括弧一六二二斜洞一三一四零四號文件，政府當局就一手住宅物業銷售監管嘅工作提供嘅文件。

224
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,380
立法會C.B.括弧一。

225
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:35,500
六二二斜洞一三一四括弧零五文件，立法會秘書處就一手住宅物業銷售監管局工作已備嘅背景資料簡介。

226
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,590
咁而家咧就係歡迎咧，政府當局係誒出席。

227
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:55,930
今日咧就係政府當出席嘅咧，誒，除咗柏志高先生繼續在座之外咧，就係有運輸及房屋局副秘書長馮建業先生，佢係兼一手住宅物業銷售監管局專員。

228
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:14,340
另一位咧就係歐海玲女士，一手住宅物業銷售監管局副專員。咁而家咧係請當局介紹文件，啊，儘量誒把握時間。誒，非常感謝主席。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The residential property first-hand sales ordinance came into effect for slightly more than eight months.

229
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:26,810
The SRPA has been in operation for around the same period, so we would like to take this opportunity to provide members with an update on the latest work of the sale of the first-hand residential properties authority.

230
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:42,570
The ordinance has been effective in facilitating prospective purchasers of first-hand residential properties to get hold of information in relation to first-hand residential properties offered for sale, and the relevant transaction information in the first-hand residential property market.

231
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:49,000
作為結果， prospective purchasers of first-hand residential properties should now be more aware of their rights.

232
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,780
Moreover, the sale of first-hand residential properties has become more transparent, fairer and more orderly.

233
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:08,400
vendors of first-hand residential properties and related parties have demonstrated that they've been able to adapt to the requirements of the ordinance and have been able to offer first-hand residential properties for sale without significant problems.

234
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:29,710
to provide members with more updated figures than those mentioned in paragraph seven of the panel papers, since the first implementation of the ordinance on the 29th of April 2013, up to 30th of December 2013, vendors have offered to sell about 8,300 first-hand residential properties in 57.

235
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,270
residential developments, of these.

236
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,760
8,300第一手 residential properties， about 6,400 have been sold.

237
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:48,180
most of the vendors have made good efforts to comply with the requirements of the ordinance and have taken prompt remedial actions upon being alerted of possible contraventions.

238
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:58,330
The SRPA has examined all the sales documents, registers of transactions and the designated websites which were made available to the public by vendors.

239
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:10,070
also， the S R P A has examined printed advertisements on first-hand residential property in major local newspapers and other forms of printed promotional materials on first-hand residential properties.

240
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:21,530
Furthermore, the S R P A has inspected all of the sales offices and show flats of first-hand residential properties which are open to the public on or after 29th of April 2013.

241
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,550
some contraventions have been found, but most of those.

242
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:32,490
found during compliance checks were technical and minor in nature and may be committed may have been committed out of carelessness.

243
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:47,190
SRPA's view is that the contraventions in most of those cases do not seem to have materially or adversely affected the transparency and fairness of the sales of first-hand residential properties and the interests of purchasers of first-hand residential properties.

244
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:57,160
There are however a few suspected cases of contravention which the SRPA considers to be of a more serious nature, and investigation work on those cases is ongoing.

245
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:05,910
as of the ninth of December two thousand one three, the SRPA has received twenty nine complaints and has completed processing twenty five of them.

246
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:12,090
一個 breakdown in terms of the object objects of the complaints are set out in paragraph seventeen of the paper.

247
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:32,380
There have also been occasions since the implementation of the ordinance when the arrangements for the sale of first-hand residential properties in individual developments have caused public concern relating to crowd management inside and outside the sales offices on the date of pre-registration or the date of balloting and/or the date of sale, or ambiguities in the method to.

248
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,470
來決定潛在買家的優先順序，以及選擇住宅物業。

249
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,850
The SRPA reacted promptly and firmly on each of those occasions.

250
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:49,710
S.R.P.A.的行動，促使vendors concern to take effective remedial action to avoid chaos and enhance the transparency of the sales activities.

251
00:44:50,410 --> 00:45:10,420
在過去八個月或 so，SRPA 已幫助 vendors 和相關 parties，包括律師、建築師和測量師，理解《條例》的要求。指引、實務備忘錄和頻繁問問題（FAQs）和答案已發出給業界。工作坊已為業界舉辦，而 SRPA 已保持

252
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,460
上，The momentum.

253
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,800
to promote the ordinance to the general public through various publicity efforts.

254
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,950
looking ahead.

255
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:26,650
We expect another challenging year ahead, given that more and more first-hand residential properties are expected to be offered for sale.

256
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:46,940
Accordingly, SRPA must step up its efforts to conduct compliance checks, handle complaints, carry out investigations, educate the trade and the public, with a view to enhance the transparency and fairness of the sale of first-hand residential properties, strengthen consumer protection and provide a level playing field for vendors of first-hand residential properties.

257
00:45:46,940 --> 00:46:05,580
colleagues and I stand ready to answer members' questions. Thank you very much. 唉，因為咧時間咧就誒過咗好多，咁所以咧我哋都要誒把握時間。咁而家咧就連問連答，每一位係三分鐘。而家登記有發誒發問嘅咧，有陶錦新、謝偉俊、李國麟。

258
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,190
梁家傑，仲有冇邊位啊？

259
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,980
葉國謙。

260
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,930
誒副主席。

261
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,070
誒，仲有逢檢機。

262
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,200
咁而家咧係請陶瑾新議員。

263
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,660
誒，主席，我其實想問咧，就用天富海灣嗰個。

264
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,330
例子咧嚟到去睇下政府究竟要求嗰啲誒資料咧，究竟係幾多？

265
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:37,430
噉我諗誒誒，馮生應該會熟啦，因為個都賣咗好多新聞咧，就係佢本來咧就係側邊咧就有成廿廿萬尺。

266
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,850
嘅誒，即係。

267
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:47,630
地方咧就係短期租約咧，就個發展商咧租誒租咗佢，咁而咧就當係一個田園咁誒綠色嘅噉樣。

268
00:46:47,910 --> 00:47:02,930
咁跟住又賣樓啦，咁噉啊，當然最最後而家咧就誒，因為政府啊可以改造停車場啦，嗰個用途，噉啊畀一間咧就高高標咧就係租咗嚟誒，可以誒泊泊車啦噉。

269
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,160
咁即係，於是咧就搞到烏哩麻茶噉樣。

270
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:15,170
咁嗱，如果你問咧，當時嗰個誒賣樓啊，即係就算去到到二零一三年十二月九號啊，嗰個尿鹼圖咧。

271
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,910
就仍然咧，就係一大片原林景嘅。

272
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:30,040
噉啊，當然啦，即係究竟係誒佢啊交地方畀佢掘起嘅時候，咁好啦，佢個樓書咧係係去到尾尾嗰度咧，好細隻字嘅。

273
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,280
噉我想問咧，呢即係政府咧，究竟覺得啊，呢類尤其是佢自己。

274
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:47,230
租誒埋嘅地方，咁即係如果佢一到到誒投輸咗，佢已經完全知道㗎啦，係嘛？咁究竟佢係咪應該誒？第一就係佢原本。

275
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:54,690
係咪應該大隻啲字？誒能夠令人即係知道嗰度咧係臨時嘅性質。第二，當佢一

276
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:15,410
誒已經係投輸咗，即係佢已經係自己嘅公司嗰個園林景已經冇嘅話咧，噉係咪佢應該咧係幾時係去更新更新嗰啲嘢？尤其是個鳥瞰圖咧係好唔到嘅。噉我想即係用呢個例子睇下，究竟測試一下誒政府執法嘅狀況係點咧？好，邊個答？阿專員同專員誒就。

277
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:35,420
住，剛才議員所提嘅嗰個發展項目咧，我哋有睇過佢哋嗰本售樓説明書。噉就根據條例咧，售樓説明書裡面咧一定要提供一個資料，就係叫做有關嘅誒資料。意思就係話咧，一啲係買即係賣方自己清楚知道，但係買家未必知道。

278
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:53,870
並唔係一啲公眾嘅資料噉樣樣咧，而如果呢啲資料本身係唔需要喺售樓説明書度提供，但係咧，我哋要求佢咧就喺呢個叫做即係有關資料嗰度提供。我哋審視過呢本售樓説明書咧，佢哋喺有關資料嗰度咧係有講到咧，就係話誒。

279
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:14,250
圍繞住屋苑嗰個地方咧，其實係一個叫做短期嘅租約，亦都有講到咧短期租約嗰個用地咧，係到到二零一三年十二月十七號咧，就係要恢復原狀交翻畀政府。咁誒，亦都有講到咧，就係話喺二零一三年十二月十七號咧，亦都已經係交咗。

280
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:34,260
政府噉樣樣噉，所以喺資料呢方面咧，佢哋係有提供到嘅。噉我哋亦都係審視過賣方咧嗰個指定嘅誒互聯網站。我哋發現咧網站裡面咧有一幅圖片咧，佢誒係依然係用翻佢之前所謂嗰個園林嘅嗰個嗰個圖片。

281
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:54,270
噉就喺圖片嗰度咧，亦都係有一個附註，就講咗係某月某日去攝影噉樣樣。咁呢個咧，我哋而家係跟進緊，因為誒任何嘅廣告咧，佢一定係要即係真實嘅。噉就誒，佢唔可以話純粹有一句説話話呢個相片係幾時攝影咗咧。冇意思啊嘛。就就真係。

282
00:49:54,270 --> 00:50:01,550
免去佢個責任，佢唔可以噉樣樣。所以我哋而家係調查緊件個案，我哋都非常之關注。多謝主席。係啊。

283
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:13,980
跟住係啊，謝偉俊議員。誒，主席，主要兩組問題。第一咧，就係睇翻文件第六段咧，就話有關嘅賣方同埋相關人士表現出佢哋冇咩大嘅困難，適應新嘅條例啦。

284
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:34,300
我睇翻成十七段咧，就話嘅處理投訴方面咧，似乎至到目前為止最多投訴嘅誒性質咧，都係同銷售安排有關，有九宗咁多，而已經完成調查咗七宗嘅。我想第一問題問一問有關嗰個投訴嘅性質係乜嘢？喺銷售方面咩困難咧？第二咧就係根據我自己嘅親身經驗咧。

285
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:54,310
就有關早前西九個賣樓嘅樓盤咧，開售嘅時候係非常之係混亂嘅，因為咧就啊，佢唔單止係話誒，由於要符合翻新嘅要求咧，喺申請嗰個攞籌方面咧已經非常混亂，攞籌完之後咧要再登記一次咧先可以有機會抽籤啊。跟住又第三次。

286
00:50:54,310 --> 00:51:14,320
咧就要做嗰個誒買賣嘅安排手續上咧，喺三輪咧令到好多業主咧都覺得係非常之貼錢買難受，非常之擾民，甚至係從來未少咁混亂。咁呢一方面咧，當局就有關新嚟嘅安排咧，喺執行方面嘅事實上有冇一啲誒繳往過剩嘅問題或者投訴出現過咧？唔該，主席。誒，邊位回答？

287
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:34,330
專員好啊，多謝主席。誒，我先答咗就係投訴性質嗰度啦。即係正如我哋文件嗰個圖表嗰度都有講到嘅，噉就誒嗰啲分類咧，就係即係受攤銷明書嗰度五宗啊，誒加單一宗啊，銷售安排係比較多啦。即係喺咁多宗之中係九宗啦。至於呢九宗嚟講咧，好多其實。

288
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:54,340
誒有成四四宗咧，都係牽涉到某一個樓盤咧。誒係被投訴，就係話誒賣方咧喺核實嗰個登記人個身份嘅時候咧，個時間係過長，同埋亦都係同嗰個秩序嗰度有關嘅。咁另外咧就亦都有啲咧就係誒就投訴就。

289
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:14,350
就係話誒，即係嗰個賣方咧要求地產代理咧，即係即係喺點樣分配嗰啲單位嘅時候嘅問題噉樣樣嚇。噉就就住議員所講嘅嗰一個西九嘅樓盤咧，其實我哋都好關注，因為我哋喺誒我哋嘅常見問答又好啦，喺我哋嘅誒指引啦同埋。

290
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:34,360
嗰個誒誒操作手則咧，我哋都講到好清楚。銷售安排咧，買方咧係有權去決定佢自己用乜嘢嘅方式去銷售，但係佢一定要講得好清楚成個銷售安排，包括咗要喺嗰個再有銷售安排嘅文件咧講得一清二楚，例如幾時開始登記啦，用咩形式嘅方法去抽籤。

291
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:54,370
啦噉樣樣噉就，我哋當時亦都即係見到賣方採取一個銷售安排嘅時候咧，我哋即時咧已經係同賣方聯絡，就話畀佢聽咧咁做法嘅時候咧，極有可能咧係會出現疊聚上嘅混亂。咁亦都得到對方嘅保證咧，佢哋會有足夠嘅人手，但係。

292
00:52:54,370 --> 00:53:14,380
誒去到銷售安誒出誒第一日之前嗰晚咧，的而且確咧係出現咗一啲混亂嘅情況。我哋亦都即時咧再同賣方去去去講，要求佢咧係去改善。咁結果咧，佢哋係即時咧係改變咗成個嗰個銷售嘅安排，令到將後嗰個誒真正開售嘅。

293
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,510
時候咧，係冇咗呢個秩序嘅問題。

294
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,170
接住係李國麟議員。

295
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:39,820
誒，多謝主席。嗱，呢個監管嘅工作咧，喺個文件亦得誒詳細出咗嚟啦。咁但係咧有樣嘢，大家都會明白嘅就係喺成個銷售過程裏邊咧，即係監管局睇啲文件啊，誒係咪誒啱條例啊，有冇嘢錯啊，噉樣做呢啲咧。咁但係成個銷售過程咧，其實係好多地產代理去做。噉我想問下。

296
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:59,830
即係啊啊局處長啦嚇，即係你哋本身同呢個地監局點樣合作，令到整個銷售除咗文件上之外咧，銷售手法啦都保障到嗰個消費者唔會會出現一啲咧係唔好嘅現象，同埋個有冇一啲誒個案或者投訴咧係關於嗰個叫做咧係銷售個手法。

297
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,440
各樣嘢，你哋都係同地監局合作嘅咧。

298
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:22,730
阿馮專員，多謝主席喺我哋條例下面咧。雖然大部分關於文件嘅嘢咧，嗰個嗰個誒罪嗰個誒責任咧係喺個賣方，但係如果去到所謂失實陳述同埋全部虛假同埋誤導嘅資訊咧，係任何人即係包括咗咧代賣方行事嘅地產代理。

299
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:42,830
咁所以變咗咧，如果地產代理佢哋喺銷售一手樓嘅時候，其實佢哋係作出咗失實陳述，或者係有一啲虛假或者誤導嘅資料咧，其實一樣係受我哋條條例嘅規管。噉我哋誒一手物業住宅銷銷售監管局咧，一直係同地產代理監管局保持緊密。

300
00:54:42,830 --> 00:55:02,840
嘅聯絡，包括咗就係話，我哋就住一啲新嘅樓盤開賣，特別係一大型嘅樓盤牽涉到頗多單位，或者我哋知道咧，就係話嗰個樓盤將會有好多登記人、好多賣家咧。我哋第一好多買家咧，我哋第一時間咧都會同誒地產代理監管局大家保持聯絡，包括咗就係話大家。

301
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:21,290
一齊咧，其實進行一啲行動嘅，例如佢哋喺銷售當日咧就會去去即係誒瞭解地產代理嗰個運作，而我哋咧主要咧就會係就住嗰個售樓處內部嘅安排咧去去作出嗰個監察噉樣樣，咁所以議員可以放心，呢方面我哋嘅合作係做得好緊密嘅。

302
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:33,790
誒接住係梁家傑議員。係主席啊，我就有留意到咧，大概半年前咧就有報章就有報導咧，就話咧有啲專業嘅誒。

303
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,200
誒嗰啲職司啊！

304
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:47,790
咁咧就被嗰啲發展商咧就要求咧，就唔單止係去誒確認啊嗰個圖質。

305
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,300
係已經。

306
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,300
如常，即係如實咁落實啦，甚至咧，就連嗰啲賣嘅。

307
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:18,010
譬如冷氣機啊，送嗰啲誒爐具啊，咁咧都要呢啲專業嘅誒職師咧就去簽署埋確認噉。咁其實我哋通過呢個條例嘅時候理解就唔應該咁㗎嘛，即係嗰啲專業人士就唔應該噉嘅。噉我就唔知道呢個報道咧。

308
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:25,970
個內容係咪屬實？同埋咧，誒監管局誒有冇知悉呢啲噉嘅情況？同埋有冇處理過咧？馮專員。

309
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:46,260
好啊！多謝主席。誒，我哋其實喺條例生效前後咧，都有同誒香港七人師學會啦，同埋香港建築師學會溝通。我哋亦都誒，佢哋都有同我哋提及過，即係喺條例初初生效嘅時候咧，有可能部分嘅發展商咧有噉嘅要求。我哋我哋都同佢哋解釋得好清楚咧，根據。

310
00:56:46,260 --> 00:57:06,270
條例咧，其實所有嘅責任，即係特別係印製售樓説明書個內容嗰啲嘢咧，其實最終咧個責任都係喺嗰個賣方嚇。噉就誒，而喺成條條例下面咧，專業人士佢哋嘅責任咧，同未有條例生效之前，基本上係完全一樣嘅，即係話。

311
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:26,280
話佢哋唔會話，因為條例生效之後咧，需要去證明一啲根本係並非佢哋專業範圍需要去認證嘅嘢噉樣樣。咁呢方面咧，佢哋係好清楚。咁喺過去誒條例生效咗接近八誒超過八個幾月啦。咁喺最近咧，我哋已經係冇收到呢方面嘅。

312
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:33,500
嘅嘅嘅嘅意見啊，噉樣樣，噉我哋相信咧，即係其實個情況咧已經係即係得到解決㗎啦，噉樣樣。

313
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,430
葉國軒議員。

314
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:55,820
誒誒，多謝主席。我我有幾個問題都想問一問嘅。第第一個就想都跟住翻，即係喺去年十月嗰個奧運站嗰個嗰個浪情灣嗰個銷售情況，即係都睇到咧，即係你哋都幾即係關於呢個監管局嚟講都幾高調噉樣去向呢方面咧，即係有翻發展商提出咗。

315
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:15,830
有一個遺憾嚇，噉我想問翻，如果呢個發展商係冇改善嘅話，會唔會構成任何嘅違例嘅問題存在咧？即係而即係從翻政府當局會唔會因為噉樣會向發展商咧會提出啲指引，避免今後會有同類型嘅事情發生嘅第一個問題？

316
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:36,270
第二方面咧，我都睇到文記第三段咧，都提及到即係你哋都喺大部分嘅巡呢個檢視同巡查之中咧，係發現到有違例嘅情況，都係可能係因為不小心而引致嘅技術或輕微嘅錯誤。呢個係我引述喺第三段都算提及到嘅。咁可唔可以？

317
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:56,280
即係今次可以提供一啲具體嘅一啲嘅例子去説明呢一個為例，啊，係冇為一手住宅物業嘅銷售嘅透明度同埋公平性，以同以同埋咧一手樓呢個物業買賣方面嘅利益帶嚟一個實質同埋重。

318
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:16,290
大嘅一個影響咧，多謝主席。馮專員，好啊，多謝主席。誒兩條題目，我先答咗第一條啦，即係就住誒去年有一個樓盤，佢哋用先到先得嘅方式去買樓咧，呢個我哋當時已經覺得咧係會有問題嘅，因為即係先到先得之餘咧，誒仲係。

319
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:32,020
講到明就係話開賣之前唔接受任何即係嗰個出面排隊嘅嗰樣嘢，咁結果係出現到有四五條隊噉樣樣。噉我哋當時係好即係係好義正言辭噉樣樣咧，去透過傳媒咧誒公開呢件事。

320
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:52,310
背後咧，我哋亦都咧係同地誒有關嘅賣方咧去去傾嘅，要求佢係去立即係立即作出改善噉樣樣。噉就誒，正如即係喺喺今次事件裏面咧，賣方係完全接受到我哋嗰個意見，因為佢哋自己都睇得到咧。再繼續咁落去嘅時候咧，只會出現到秩序嗰個混亂。咁如

321
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:57,460
如果假設誒賣方當時佢並冇去改變嗰個銷售嘅策略咧，

322
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:17,750
誒，而佢繼續係用翻原有嗰個方法去賣樓，我哋就會好細心咁去審視一下佢每一個環節究竟咧，例如同佢當時所講嘅銷售安排裏面嗰個嗰嗰啲情況係咪係咪係咪完全吻合咧？會唔會根本上係有唔同咧？亦都會睇下就係話有冇一啲。

323
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:25,010
地方咧係違反咗條例，只要係違反到條例咧，我哋係會好嚴厲噉樣樣咧去處理同埋去作出跟進。

324
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:39,590
咁至於誒，我哋喺文件裏面都講咗，就係話，其實我哋條例下面咧係有總共一百二十個刑事嘅罪行，大部分呢一百個二十個刑事罪行咧，主要都係落咗喺售樓説明書裏面。

325
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:59,910
我哋睇過所有嘅售樓説明書，所有嘅文件基本上每一本售樓説明書咧，佢一佢佢都到今時今日為止都係有技術上係有犯錯。咁換句話嚟講咧，每一本售樓説明書技術技術上咧都係犯咗刑事嘅罪行。咁但係大部分係啲乜嘢嘢嚟咧？例如就係話售樓説明書裡面咧要求。

326
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:12,820
每一個發展項目裡面嘅單位咧，佢都要有個叫做誒內部嘅平面圖。我哋要求佢每一個平面圖裡面，就住每個單位咧，係要畫曬佢所有唔同嘅尺寸。

327
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:24,880
即係包括咗，如果係一個誒，未必係一個正方形咧，三尖八角嘅一個誒平面圖裡面咧，佢幾乎每每一個誒dimension，佢都要畫得清清楚楚。

328
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:45,170
喺而家咁複雜嘅嘅平面圖裡面咧，通常嚟講一個單位咧講緊牽涉超過一百個dimension，一百個呢啲噉嘅尺寸。我哋發現咧有好好多時候咧，佢會漏咗幾個或者漏咗誒誒十個噉樣樣。咁但但係呢啲所謂嘅漏咧，都唔係話佢成個客廳噉樣漏，而係。

329
01:01:45,170 --> 01:02:05,180
話有可能係某一個牆壁裏面啱啱即係即係個空間好好細嘅空間，佢佢佢漏咗話噉。我哋即時咧會同佢講，會同佢解釋。而到目前為止咧，全部人咧都聽咗我哋之後咧，完全係會即時去更新佢嘅售樓説明書，全部全部加翻正噉樣樣。

330
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:25,190
咁另外亦都有啲咧，就係話佢佢喺嗰個標題嗰度寫錯咗一啲字眼噉樣樣，而但係呢啲字眼咧，基本上例如係寫漏咗個字啊，亦都有啲係一啲所所謂叫做手民之誤。噉我哋其實係好小心咁去睇過，都相信呢一啲咧係唔唔會影響到即係嗰個買。

331
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:45,200
家嘅利益，但係對於一啲比較嚴重嘅個案咧，正如我哋喺文章度都有講咧，我哋而家係跟進緊，咁亦都會嚴肅處理。好，多謝主席。誒，希望大家都掌握時間，連問連答三分鐘。不過，由於阿馮川江秦李就著葉國謙議員個詢問咧，嗰啲個案咧，就我容許你咧長詳細少少解釋嚇。

332
01:02:45,200 --> 01:03:05,210
以下都係三分鐘，連問連答。跟住係逢檢機遇。主席嘅兩個問題，一個問題就誒個報告裏面咧比較少講啊，少提到咧究竟啲用家係咪都明白，即係佢自己轉咗呢個即係使用面積之後，佢嗰個誒理解啊、認識啊、誒習唔習慣用呢一啲去睇佢自己買嗰啲。

333
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:25,220
嘢咧咁呢個調查有冇包括？如果冇，將來會呢度都做一個研究，睇下啲用家點睇咧噉。咁第二個，我都想問問咧，就係我估計個趨勢咧，就無論一手二手都應該全面地誒用呢一個使用面積㗎。咁究竟成成個推出過程之後，由發展家發展商到嗰個誒誒地產。

334
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:45,230
地產商即係就嗰啲嘅經紀，以致到誒誒買賣嗰啲嗰個係咪都適應呢個做法咧？我自己有個擔心嘅，因為誒投資啦、投機啦嗰啲可能真係唔關理你係實用啊定唔實用嘅喎。總之我睇個市上我咪買咯，睇個市落我咪掟掟出去啦。咁理鬼你咩實用唔實用啊？噉樣。

335
01:03:45,230 --> 01:04:05,240
咁呢個呢個噉樣可能呢類嘅人咧，我估係嚟嚟啡啡啲多啲嘅。咁究竟成個適應過程，成個市場係咪都好似誒官方所講係能夠到到做到咧？係各方面都絕大部分人都認同呢個做法咧？噉，啊主席，阿馮專員，多謝主席。首先條例下面。

336
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:25,250
規定咧一手樓咧一定只能夠講呢個實用面積咧，咁呢個已經係一個法例嘅要求。到目前為止，我哋睇過曬所有嘅銷售文件，都未見到有喺呢方面違例嘅情況。買家嗰方面咧，其實我哋誒一手住宅物業銷售監管局設立咗一條熱線，主要係畀一啲公眾人士咧同埋準買。

337
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:45,260
大家咧係去查詢嘅，噉就誒佢哋如果就住實用面積嗰個情況唔清楚咧，其實佢哋可以即係向我哋瞭解。但據我哋所知咧，誒查詢實用面積呢方面嘅都嘅嘅人士都唔係咁多。咁另外，我哋亦都出咗一啲即係誒小冊子啦，就係畀一啲一手物業嘅準買家。

338
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:50,930
裏面亦都有話畀佢哋聽咧，就係即係嗰個實用面積個定義係啲乜嘢嘢噉樣樣。

339
01:04:51,210 --> 01:05:11,220
喺一手市場以外咧，二手市場其實地產代理監管局為咗配合我哋條例嘅生效咧，喺今喺二零一三年一月一號開始咧，已經要求所有嘅二手物業嘅誒嘅經紀咧，佢哋一定要講埋呢一個誒實用面積嘅，咁所以變。

340
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:31,230
變咗而家嚟講咧，如果大家去行去一啲嘅地產代理嘅嘅店鋪咧，你都會發現咧係就住二手住宅物業咧，佢哋必然都會講埋呢一個實用面積。噉我哋睇咗過去八個月咧，覺得成個誒實用面積嗰個使用咧個情況係非常之理想。多謝主席。誒，最最簡單咪又出嚟咪。

341
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:51,240
會向嗰啲準買家做一啲宣傳，你點揾到個準買家？點揾翻嚟啊？好誒，準買家嗰方面咧，其實我哋係透過我哋嘅出宣傳嘅小冊子啦。咁另外，我哋亦都有我哋喺即係柴灣辦事處裡面嘅有個資源中心啦。咁另外，我哋有個熱線電話咧，個熱線電話我哋都係即係誒宣傳咗嘅。咁

342
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,510
佢哋其實係可以打電話上嚟查詢。石禮謙議員。

343
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:16,330
新報，我係代表地產界主席，我係依個地產誒誒reader嗰個成員嚟㗎。主席，我想問咧，喺依個由依個誒條例已經執行咗八個月啦，喺依個八句佢而家佢個報告咁去講出嚟。頭先啊，馮建基問佢啲買家適唔適應啊，噉我誒想問一問誒政。

344
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:36,340
府咧，佢哋喺依個依個條例嗰度裏邊去執行嗰陣時，有冇同依個地產建造商會誒問下佢哋嗰個問題有冇出於喺邊度，而點去改善咧？如果改善有冇有冇需要翻翻嚟，你點去改善而令到啲買家誒可以瞭解多啲？

345
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:56,350
第二樣嘢咧，又唔好喺度拖慢咗呢個流新嘅流預供應喺度，有冇噉嘅事情發生咗？主席，馮專員多謝主席。其實我哋喺誒過去八個幾九個月啦，同埋其實喺條例生效之前，我哋一直都有同業界去保持溝通，包括咗同香港地產建設商會去溝通。

346
01:06:56,350 --> 01:07:16,360
咁所以變咗，大家都會睇得到咧。我哋喺唔同嘅時間咧，都會出咗好多新嘅常見嘅問答啦，包括咗上個禮拜我哋又出咗另外十八條，而家總共嘅常見問答去到成一百二十幾條噉樣樣。呢啲都係咧誒，我哋即係聽翻業界嘅意見之後咧，我哋誒幫助業界去進一步瞭解條即係嗰個法。

347
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:24,930
法例噉樣樣，咁大家可以放心。我哋會繼續同業界保持溝通，去聽佢哋嘅意見，亦都會盡量幫佢哋去了解嗰個條例。

348
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:45,750
主席，我想再再問咧，即係喺喺而家去去了解嗰陣時，嗰個業界有冇解釋有啲問題？佢哋真係做唔到，而係你哋係要係喺依條例嗰段裏邊咧，就要佢哋去做，而係影響到嗰個供應喺個市場供應新樓嗰度，因為市場市場供應新樓會影響到個價錢嘅。主

349
01:07:45,750 --> 01:08:05,760
個價錢一一一供應少咗，個價格會上升，即係供應與誒誒喺呢方面。噉你有冇瞭解到呢個問題？好啊，多謝主席。或者我補充一下咧，就喺成個過程之中咧誒，我哋並並冇發覺話賣方話有啲嘢係完全做唔到，咁所以即係冇辦法去做，只不。

350
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:25,770
不過係喺過程之中，佢哋對於條例嗰個要求有唔清晰嘅地方，噉我哋盡量向佢解釋。咁事實上咧，大家睇得翻咧，喺過去幾個月咧，一手住宅物業嗰個供應咧，其實誒已經係即係越嚟越多個供應。到目前為止咧，已經有五十七個發展項目，總共其實係提供咗八千。

351
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:45,780
千三百個一手住宅物業嘅單位去出售，而喺呢五十七個項目之中咧，誒賣方只係提供咗八千三百個，佢哋手上其實仲有其他，到目前為止咧都未開賣。如果佢哋願意嘅話咧，其實佢哋都係可以隨時再去開賣噉樣樣。多謝主席。國家奇緣誒，朱靜就我。

352
01:08:45,780 --> 01:09:05,790
我想問翻咧兩樣嘢，一個就係有關於而家嗰啲誒一手樓啲發展商咧，有一啲話叫做假買賣嘅，有啲媒介都睇到啦，即係話啲所謂啲買家咧，其實都係通過好多啲手法，有啲可能係譬如話係嗰啲票不斷噉樣放喺嗰個地產代理去到做。

353
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,020
或者甚至係誒。

354
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:19,000
用一啲方法，譬如入一張票就可以，嗰個地產代理公司就好似安排幾張票畀佢，即係好似製造一個假象，又有好多嗰啲認購。

355
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:39,290
咁呢一個咧，係咪你哋地產誒代理監管局要去睇翻一啲？因為呢個咧會市場嘅資訊咧，會影響一啲市民去購買樓宇嗰個諗法嘅。呢個係咪你哋要睇？如果你哋要睇嘅，你哋做咗啲咩嘢？如果冇睇嘅係點解？第二個咧就有有關於呢度講嘅有。

356
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:52,440
二十五宗完成投訴嘅一啲嘅誒舉報啦嚇，有邊一啲咧？實質上咧，你哋會打算或者係有足夠嘅證據咧，係進行刑事嘅檢控，因為呢個咧係相當重要嘅。

357
01:09:52,720 --> 01:10:09,090
誒，我哋就唔希望見得到咧，就政府係即係容忍咗一啲係誒唔到咗消費者嘅一啲嘅行為。噉我哋絕對同意咧，如果係有足夠嘅證據，係應該去檢控嘅問題。嘅政府有冇咁做？有冇話因為地產商？

358
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:29,400
誒有財雄勢大咧，係冇係做到你哋嘅責任咧，係去進行一個檢控。如果如果係有檢控嘅數字，即係預計檢控嘅數字，可唔可以呢度同我哋透露一下？洪專員，好啊，多謝主席。誒，首先我哋即係就住話有地產代理，即係佢哋會代客。

359
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:49,410
人去墊資，然之後去入票呢個情況咧，嗱根據誒地產代理監管局佢所出嗰啲守則嚟講咧，地產經紀係絕對唔可以喺任何情況之下都唔可以咧，就係去代客去去入票或者代客去墊資噉樣樣。如果誒畀地產代理監管局調查過。

360
01:10:49,410 --> 01:11:09,420
之後發現有噉嘅情況咧，佢哋係會即係誒進行嗰個處分，最嚴重嘅係除咗佢嗰個牌噉樣樣。噉就我哋自己亦都有密切留意住，就係話唔同嘅賣方佢哋都會講話入咗幾多票啊，收咗幾多票。咁呢啲咧，我哋會好，我哋密切監察。如果我哋認為我哋覺得中間係有。

361
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:29,430
一啲叫做虛假嘅陳述，或者懷疑係一啲發放一啲虛假唔同嘅資料咧，我哋會進行了解同埋調查同埋跟進，呢個我哋都好小心去處理。噉就喺投訴嗰方面嚟講咧，其實我哋而家完成咗嘅投訴之中咧，就誒最比較複雜嗰啲咧，我哋而家未完成，咁嗰啲。

362
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:49,440
主要嚟講咧，都係牽涉到我哋認為係一啲所謂嘅失實嘅陳述。咁呢方面需要多少少時間咧，我哋係去去即係蒐集嗰個證據。我想講嘅咧就係話，所有嘅投訴誒同，不論係投訴又好，或者係我哋自己透過我哋嗰個巡查檢視而而認為有問題嘅地方咧，我哋。

363
01:11:49,440 --> 01:12:09,450
全部都會立案去調查，然之後都到我哋誒調查完畢之後咧，其實所有嘅個案咧，我哋都會交畀律政司刑事檢控科嗰邊，因為咧，然之後我哋當然我哋會仲有我哋嘅建議，就係話係咪去作出檢控，但係最終咧檢控與否嗰個嗰個決定咧，就會係律政司嘅刑事檢控科噉樣樣。

364
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:29,460
唔係，主席問個數啫，有幾多個數你哋會打算或者係？不如你答，有幾多立咗案好冇啊？立案或者你哋會處理，或者會交畀律政處？立案嘅數目非常之多，誒，因為正如我所講咧，成條條例裡面有一百二十個刑事嘅嘅罪行，咁而基本上所有嘅流。

365
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:49,470
書咧理論上都係技術上犯咗好多嘅錯處，咁但係裡面係有分輕重之分嘅。噉就誒，但係我哋到目前為止覺得比較即係嚴重嗰啲個案咧，主要係牽涉到賣方啦，或者係地產代理作出一啲失實嘅陳述，或者係虛假嘅誤導。咁呢方面係。

366
01:12:49,470 --> 01:13:09,480
有誒誒一定程度數數目嘅過案，我哋而家仲喺即係成個過程之中，噉係係係未有時間幾時會佢而家未答到你，因為佢仲在調查之中一啲冇錯，因為個過程之中，我哋需要誒請證人上嚟去去畀證供啦，亦都需要係請當事人上嚟去畀證供噉樣樣。

367
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:10,980
王毓文議員。

368
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:19,460
嗱，呢個即係條例咧，就係喺二零一二年六月，我哋打緊拉布嘅時候通過嘅啊。

369
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:39,750
噉就二零一三年嘅四月廿九號就正式頒佈實行，咁到到而家就即係都係即係半年多啲啊！咁但係喺呢半年期間，大家都睇到個樓市呢啲所謂政府嘅雙辣椒咧，咁咪令到個樓市氣氛相對就比較冷淡啲。所以我認為咧條例究竟。

370
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:59,760
能否即係喺呢個誒提高一手住宅物業銷售嘅透明度同埋公平，加強對消費者保障，同埋為呢個一手住宅誒物業買方提供公平競爭環境咧？你係未得到全面嘅考驗嘅，OK？呢個必須要肯定。啊，第二個咧就喺你民。

371
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:19,770
件嘅第九至十一段裏邊咧，嗱你交代咗銷售監管局，即係檢視呢個銷售文件同埋巡查售樓處同埋示範單位嘅工作。但係我哋感到疑惑嘅就係，喂，所有嘅檢視結果係顯示咗一樣嘢，就係幾乎係每一個住宅發展項目初次提供嘅售樓説明書都有違反呢個條例嘅。

372
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:39,780
個要求嘅係咪有啲項目咧，更加係違反咗即係條例裏邊有關嗰啲誒誒價單啊，再有銷售安排文件、成交記錄冊、印製廣告啊，同埋示範單位嘅規規定。咁究竟係發展商即係作為呢個交易資源相對充分嘅一方，理解條？

373
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:59,790
嚟要求出現問題，一淨係你哋失職咧，係咪個推廣功夫做得唔夠咧？係嘛，因為我睇翻你個文件，你個檢視嘅結果係噉樣。另外一點咧，就係話喺文件第十四段裏邊咧，都話即係透露咗幾單即係性質比較嚴重嘅即係違規違例嘅個案。嗱，我認為喺唔影。

374
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:19,800
影響調查嘅情況之下咧，即係銷售監管局應該盡快公佈有關情節。OK，呢一個先係有透明度嘅，令到公眾同埋業界對有關溝佢規定咧更加瞭解，幫你做工作，等於係係嘛提高警惕。嗱喺呢個二十九宗嘅投訴之中，已經完成嘅有廿五宗，係嘛咁所以。

375
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:29,890
我覺得咧，即係誒，啊當然頭先都有提到嗰個檢控嘅建議嘅問題啦，係嘛？咁但係我覺得你係要公佈嗰啲內容畀我哋聽嘅喎，係咪？

376
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:50,230
咪要具體個事實係乜嘢，要公佈先得㗎。嗱，另外一點咧，呢個係我意見嚟嘅。過去都有啲議員，譬如啊，特別我哋喺呢個條例草案即係誒辯論嘅期間咧，即係都有提過嘅，就係一個市場兩個制度啊，一手樓、二手樓，你係好容易造成混亂嘅，係嘛？所以即係嗱，當然當局就話。

377
01:15:50,230 --> 01:16:10,240
誒，我哋暫時無意將個條例嘅範圍，即係即係適用嘅範圍，就擴大到涵蓋二手市場。因為呢個都講明條例都好清楚係講一手樓嘅啫，係咪？咁但係事實上咧，即係誒係有必要即係改變呢一種，即係從政策嘅範疇嚟。

378
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:30,250
睇改變呢種一個市場兩個制度嘅嗰個做法嘅係咪？咁另外咧就話個二手市場嘅買家都應該得到法律嘅保障㗎嘛，大佬係咪？你二手樓嘅樓盤仲佔嗰個成交量八成半係嘛？你淨係針對一手樓，阿黃宇，時間過咗好多㗎啦，畀啲時間去答我。我仲有幾樣，不過唔緊要啦。

379
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,860
你你可以回應啊回應啦，一係一係就處長回應嗰個二手樓。

380
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:55,150
即係幾時可以將二手樓都涵蓋埋喺嗰個規管嗰度？阿馮專員，你簡短回應。阿白小姐，你簡短回應啦。

381
01:16:55,150 --> 01:17:15,160
Quite rightly said. Actually, the market is very, very calm at the moment. There doesn't seem to be particular urgency for us to extend the equivalent provisions in the law. Having said that, of course, as my colleagues explain, the estate agents' authority has taken parallel action to ensure that.

382
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:20,220
provision on saleable area is already required from all estate agents, but

383
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:32,490
其他 aspect，such as the brochure requirements，simply not relevant to second-hand sales，so it's not a simple matter of an extension. You have to look at a totally different regime for second-hand sales，so it's not a priority at this moment.

384
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:53,690
馮志，唔係，但係唔係嗱，我我意思唔係叫你行，即係喺呢條條例，你會唔會譬如話，假設我哋更進一步，你你都要修例係嘛？即係連呢啲二手樓都規管喺政策上邊，即係噉樣係嘛？當然我哋明白你一手樓而家呢個範圍，你係冇可能涵蓋到㗎嘛？呢個我哋明白嘅。你頭先嗰個答覆我係接受嘅，但係我意思就。

385
01:17:53,690 --> 01:18:13,700
可唔可以積極啲諗一諗？畀阿馮專員回應埋咧嚇。嗯，多謝主席。我諗誒回應翻就係話咧誒，如果我哋發現有啲情況，買買方佢哋嘅情況咧係會影響到公眾嗰個利益，特別係準買家嘅利益咧。其實即使係我哋未完成調查又好，或者係只要我哋第一時。

386
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:24,120
發現呢啲情況咧，其實我哋以往咁多個月咧，都已經即時咧係去透過即係即係傳媒啊，同埋透過我哋自己嘅網頁咧，係去即係即係誒。

387
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:38,450
提醒買家，叫我哋小心呢類噉樣樣嘅銷售手法。多謝主席。誒，呢個題目咧就因為我哋都過咗鐘好耐啦，咁因此咧我哋就討論到呢一度啦。咁而家咧就去到第六個議程。

388
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:58,960
建議在房屋署開設三個常額首長級職位，以應付因公營房屋新建屋量目標所產生嘅額外工作量。立法會文件就係C.B.庫一六二斜洞一三一四零六號文件，政府當局就建議在。

389
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:09,110
房屋署開設三個常額首長級職位，以應付因公營房屋新建屋量目標所產生嘅額外工作。

390
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:17,700
提交嘅文件，咁咧就係誒，而家咧就係除咗柏書高先生在席嘅咧。

391
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:37,990
而家嚟到嘅咧，仲係有馮怡軒誒女士，房屋署副署長。咁咧就係阿柏先生，係咪你介紹文件啊？啊，簡短好嘛嚇。Mr. Chairman，I'll be very brief. The agenda item is about the proposal to create one permanent chief architect, one permanent chief structural engineer post in the housing department.

392
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:58,000
with effect from the 2nd of May to cope with the increase in workload arising from the new public housing production targets. This paper deals with the production side. The other paper was on the policy side. And we also want to create one permanent chief engineer post for the administration implementation of housing-related infrastructure projects.

393
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,030
under the Capital Works Reserve Fund.

394
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:10,890
The chief executive announced in the two hundred and one three policy address production of rental public rental housing flats would increase by five thousand per year on average from two hundred and one eight one nine.

395
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,080
onwards.

396
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:32,370
那係從年均平均十五千至二十千個單位，有個壓縮的交期係五年。喺同一時間，跟住宣佈前首席執行官關於重啟居屋計劃喺二零一一年末，就決定總共會提供十七千個居屋單位，喺四個年期內。

397
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:45,270
六一七至二零一九，二零，with a production target of 5,000 flats a year on average thereafter. The first batch of the new HOS flats is already scheduled for sale at the end of this year.

398
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:55,450
In response to the above policy decisions, the overall public housing production target has increased substantially to a yearly average of 25,000 units.

399
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:15,770
this has considerable workload implications for all divisions in housing department, but particularly for the development and construction division, which is tasked to produce PRH and HOS flats. With the approval of the finance committee of the legislative council, a total of eight directorate posts have been created in the development and construction division to cope with the additional workload.

400
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,350
Since July, I won't go through the details of those.

401
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:39,060
all those posts were created to handle the increase in workload arising from the additional 5,000 HOS flats per year. In view of the ongoing and further increases in workload to implement the new public rental housing production target, with a further increase of 5,000 flats per year and the corresponding increase in housing related.

402
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:50,430
Infrastructure projects under the Capital Works Head 711. We need to further strengthen the Directorate support by creating the three Directorate posts.

403
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:57,240
I think I'll stop there, Mr. Chairman. I'll ask Ms. Fung to give any further information. Please keep it short.

404
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,680
馮女士有冇咩補充？

405
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:19,970
我諗簡單補充咧，就係因應個政策宣言咧，推行公屋新建屋量，令到工作量係上升啦。咁由於喺零一八一九年度每年要興建誒約二萬個公屋單位，喺規劃到到完工最少要五年嘅籌備時間嚟計算咧，前期工作已經喺零一三年已經開展咗。

406
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:40,140
因此，我哋好急需要增添人手，加上係基本工程儲備金誒總目車一下邊同房屋相關嘅基建項目相應增加咧，我係需要係喺發展局建築署係增設三個上級職位啦，進一步係鞏固我哋上級嗰個人手嘅支援。噉我哋就誒簡單而言咧。

407
01:22:40,140 --> 01:23:00,150
就係開始一個係常額總建築師職位，噉我哋需要咧就係誒呢個總建築師咧就係負責去處理部分新公屋發展帶嚟嘅額外工作量啦，同埋係監督有關嘅工程，咁同埋佢係作為一個公營房屋發展項目嗰個項目經理啦，要帶領喺發展項目裏邊。

408
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:11,230
由初爾到到完工後各個階段，就肩負去策劃同埋領導嘅工作，同埋帶領進行發展項目嘅社區參與工作咧，同埋相關改善工程。

409
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:14,900
啊，同埋係新增公屋發展項目監督地盤。

410
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:20,770
佢發展潛力嘅研究啦、規劃啦、設計同埋施工方面嘅誒建築物工作嘅。

411
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:41,110
咁第二個就係開始一個係常額嘅總結嘅工程師嘅職位。誒，我哋需要一個增設一個總結嘅工程師嘅職位咧，去負責係監督新增公屋發展項目喺地盤發展潛力研究、誒規劃設計同埋施工方面嘅結構工程服務，同埋係發展項目初爾到。

412
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:48,420
對員工各階段同埋最後發展項目嗰個進行嘅改善工程等等咧，去提供呢個結構方面嘅支援嘅。

413
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:52,780
同埋就第三就開始一個係上額嘅總工程師職位。

414
01:23:53,060 --> 01:24:13,070
咁呢一個總工程師係需要係誒進行一個為我哋係隨宜發展項目增加嘅工程影響研究啦，確保土地供應足夠，基建項目可以係從速展開同埋順利完成啦。因為最最近嗰啲誒土地發展需要咧係所需。

415
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:22,060
需進行嘅工程影響研究係隨而增加，同埋係物適合式房屋土地等等咧，都要增加呢個工作量嘅。咁誒。

416
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:34,750
我噉我簡介就係到呢一度為止嚇。誒而家咧誒登記咗係有準備發言嘅咧，有黃毓民、梁耀忠、盧偉國長，冇人想誒登記發言。

417
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:40,590
咁咧，如果冇咧，就係誒，我哋連問連答三分鐘啦。請黃毓民議員。

418
01:24:41,340 --> 01:25:01,350
嗱，頭先政府即係提到咧，由二零一八至到一九年度咧，咁即係公屋就每年平均個建屋量會增加五千個單位，即係二萬個單位啦。咁誒，而家就要開始做嗰個誒規劃工作啊。咁所以要增加三個常額首長級嘅職位嚟應付係咪？噉。

419
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:07,620
我哋可以理解嘅，咁但係我對政府過去一直以來個開位嘅做法咧，都係有啲保留，唔係。

420
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:17,750
嗱，即係喺二零一二年七月以嚟咧，房署亦都得到立法會財委會嘅批准，喺發展同埋建築署開設八個首長級職位。

421
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:38,040
咁分別係六個首長級職位同埋兩個主管專業職係嘅人員。咁而家又增加三個上額嘅職位。咁頭先即係副副誒，即係呢個誒誒誒副處長提到咧，就話誒嗰三個位啊，上額結總建築師職位，上額結構總結構工程師職位，上額總。

422
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:58,050
工程師職位嗱，呢啲全部都涉及興建公屋嘅專業技能。嗱，我哋咧就冇相關嘅專業知識，就好難判斷你呢三個所謂常額嘅職位嗰個職能係嘛？即係我哋好難去判斷係嘛？我只能夠信你，或者你你提出即係嗰個嗰個你。

423
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:18,060
句係嘛？我哋只能夠相信你嘅啫，係嘛噉，然後即係去監督你嘅，只能夠噉嘅啫。因為我完全你喺我嘅專業知識範圍裏邊，點解要加呢三個位咧？咁一個夠唔夠咧？咁即係我哋好難去咩嘅噉。但係即使嗰個建屋量嘅目標即係增加咗，但係你都係要政府其實咪都應該係保持呢個所謂小政。

424
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:38,070
估㗎係咪？餵你唔係淨係你一個部門加位噉啊！而家係係咪啊？你而家睇下人事編制委員會排緊嗰啲，或者過去呢一段時間，即係立法會新嘅會期開議之後，即係加嗰啲位都好得人驚㗎。係咪？你個政府一路一路喺度膨脹緊，係咪？當然而家大家對嗰個建屋目標。

425
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:58,080
係咪有期待嘅係咪咁？你而家話誒，我一八一九年開始要每年多五千個單位，噉我哋冇理由話唔好嘅，最好都起起一萬添啦。唔係嘅，你唔夠啦。老實講，而家排緊隊廿幾萬，跟住而家如果即係法院又判呢個，即係阿新來港嗰啲業民又可以即時即係排隊。

426
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:12,160
輪公屋嘅重大禍係咪？你根本永遠都解決唔到呢個問題嘅。嗱呢個公屋即係建屋目標有增加，政府嘅政策其實都應該係繼續保持呢個少政府嘅原則係咪？畀啲時間佢答啦。係嗱誒。

427
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:32,740
咁答就係答嗰個膨脹啦，係咪？噉你即係你話有冇第啲辦法去即係啊調整一下？咪真係要開呢三個位咧？開一個得唔得咧？係咪？之前開咗八個㗎啦嘛，係咪？簡短答啦，好嘛。Mr Chairman, I'll start and I'll pass it on to to Ada. Um, I think there's a few points here. First.

428
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:52,750
Actually, as far as the total number of director posts in the department, we we we we're actually 15 down to what we were when we were amalgamated with the bureau. Most of those were in the in the development side. Secondly, these are three distinct types of operation: architect, engineers, structural.

429
01:27:52,750 --> 01:28:03,450
Engineer, they have distinct areas of responsibility. You can't combine them into one and do that. So I'm afraid that is not an option. And third point I would make is that

430
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:15,930
We downsized significantly, not just in the directorate staff, but in our in our regular staff.即對手咪點講政策？From 2002, they stopped the home ownership scheme programme and so on and so forth.

431
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:22,430
having restarted that programme, you have to have the resources to allow us to do the build that we're required to produce.

432
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:42,720
我係under huge pressure from my staff associations, from my colleagues to produce these numbers, and and they really are. Judy Homoy，噉你即係叫佢畀個即係breakdown又好，即係你你一個頭先佢講嗰啲嘢啦。嗱，你話我根本就少咗人手，而家我補翻啫嘛。噉你畀翻啲數據我哋具體啲，好嘛？

433
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:48,350
Mr. Chairman, I did provide that already in the context of the previous paper.

434
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:53,090
佢喺文件已經提供咗啦。好，接住係阿梁耀忠議員。

435
01:28:53,370 --> 01:29:05,890
主席，誒，其實嗰個加建個公屋量咧邊嚟講話咧，係咪真係好多咧？多到增加人人數要三個咁多咧？噉我哋真係好難去衡量嘅，即係對我哋嚟講係。咁但係不過咧就誒。

436
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:26,230
當然咧，頭先你睇上一節，你都講過咧，你有好多事，你話咧曾經講過話，如果人手唔夠嘅咧，拖慢咗啲工作咧，就唔關你事噉樣，即係依一個咧令到我好擔心，即係即係而家已經係嗰個個個屋量已經係唔夠嘅，噉你如果你仲仲講埋依句説話咧，噉啊變咗我哋在人，唔係你在人噉樣樣將個責任擺喺我哋身上，咁所以變咗咧，我覺得咧，除非

437
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,800
真係咧！你真係好後一個嘅。

438
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:49,250
誒口齒，你落實得到即係落實得到，你唔好做做時到啊！又話誒有啲困難，有困難啦噉樣，即係如果就唔係咧，我都我好難，我哋好難即係同班觀眾交代㗎嘛。於是嚟講，係呢個第一個問題我想講嘅。第二個咧就係而家你講緊呢一啲project咧，全部都係新發展嘅project嚟嘅。但係我想問一問咧，你？

439
01:29:49,250 --> 01:30:00,600
會冇諗到喺度重建嗰個project咧？其實我哋而家建議咧，就有啲屋邨咧，希望你都重建嘅。噉你會唔會包括埋依啲工作都做埋依樣嘢咧？白志偉先生，嗯，Mr. Chairman。

440
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:20,890
Let me deal with the redevelopment one, then I'll ask Ada to deal with the other one. Yes, we are looking at a programme of redevelopment. We have already announced Pact 10, for example. I've had a working group within the department looking at all of our older estates, roughly those that are over 40 years old, and we will be consulting the housing authority in due course on a redevelopment.

441
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:40,900
Obviously, I need to be a bit careful because it takes a lot of time to do a redevelopment project, and I don't want to sort of start getting people concerned that their particular estate is being targeted when it may be ten years away or fifteen years away, because we have to have a long-term programme. So yes, redevelopment is definitely something we're looking at. Perhaps Ada can deal with the.

442
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,500
阿馮女士。

443
01:30:43,150 --> 01:31:03,160
嗯，多謝主席。其實嗯，我哋嗰個工作量同埋工作進度咧，誒，同人力資源都係息息相關嘅。因為例如好多新工程嘅開展，咁如果係重建村咧，所需要個涵蓋嗰個覆蓋面可能更加複雜，因為有好多要重置嘅安排添。咁所以就係我哋係。

444
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:09,320
好需要呢啲啊專責嘅專業人士咧，去幫我手一齊去處理一啲特別係前端工作。

445
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:29,610
我哋曾經提過咧，我哋一個正常嘅項目要七年咧，先至可以由嗰個誒研究啦、規劃啦、設計啦、施工去到完成。現在我哋仲有一個必要，就係要將佢呢個工作係壓縮添。咁所以喺壓縮嘅情況底下咧，需要嘅資源上應該會係更更加係會係誒要濃縮，同埋更加就係要精簡。

446
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,810
藍天，即係幾錢？

447
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:34,700
誒，盧偉國議員。誒，多謝主席。

448
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:55,170
主席，正如我頭先喺另一個以前嘅時間咧，都有申報咧。我就係房屋委員會建築同埋受標小組嘅成員啊，咁都係業務工作啫嚇，唔係受薪嘅。咁亦都正因為如此咧，所以我喺以往即係即使係加入呢個立法會工作之前咧，就對於。

449
01:31:55,170 --> 01:32:07,070
誒相關嘅專業職係嘅同事嘅人手編制，佢哋工作狀況咧都有一定程度嘅瞭解，所以我係誒好支持咧。

450
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:13,690
今次呢邊提出嘅增加幾個即係專業職係嘅首長級嘅崗位。

451
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:34,030
誒，實際上咧，喺二零零三年呢個誒處局合併之後咧，其實的確整個編制嚟講係縮減嘅，都相當多嘅。咁隨住嗰個工作量嘅一路路增加，除咗嗰個量之外咧，其實工作嘅質咧都係有所改變。

452
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:36,340
正如咧喺以往誒。

453
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:49,260
誒相同嘅議題啦，我都提過咧。其實而家工程師咧做埋啲地區諮詢啊、啊嚟立法會解話等等嘅工作啊，咁呢方面咧係都係一啲工作上係即係必須要做嘅嘢啦。當然。

454
01:32:49,540 --> 01:33:09,550
噉我我其實就亦都留意到咧，喺今次幾個崗位咧，就有誒建築師咧，有工程師咧。工程師裏邊咧有呢個結構同埋土木嘅。咁誒土木工程師裏邊，其實今次提出呢個崗位咧，其實就同現有嘅兩個總土木工程師嘅嘅。

455
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:27,130
崗位嘅分工咧都有勞劣噉啊！我唔再即係即係即係解釋我嘅睇法。不過咧，我覺得誒呢度嗰個分工都係合理嘅，因此我我哋都係支持。特別係咧，就而家呢個新嘅崗位啦，就喺土木工程方面嘅。

456
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:47,530
誒呢一個係公務計劃方面嘅，即係專責呢方面嘅工作嘅總工程師咧，就對於誒長遠嘅房屋供應，特別喺土地啊，誒如何確保佢能夠如期能夠支援到新建嘅房屋等等，係一個比較關鍵嘅工作。

457
01:33:47,630 --> 01:34:07,640
咁喺呢方面同現有嘅另外誒總工程師一二嚇總土木工程師一二嘅分工咧，我睇翻文件提供嘅呢個分工都係相當合理，所以咧作為我自己都係專業工程師啊，雖然我就唔係土木嚇，咁但係我我就會支持呢個呢個編制。誒，我其實亦都好關。

458
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:27,650
心咧就係喺首長級以下嘅團隊嗰個工作量嘅問題。咁誒文件裏邊亦都有提到咧喺相應嘅一啲增加。咁但係呢一方面咧，我都表示咧會一直會會會關注嘅，因為咧淨係將軍誒都係唔足夠，你都需要有咧支援嘅下邊嘅誒。

459
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:45,640
高級工程師啊，工程師啊，嗰啲崗位啊，多謝主席。誒，部門需唔需要回應？Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the honourable member is absolutely right, and I do want to emphasise this: we do need the additional working force at the non-directorate level, and we will be moving forward on that through the normal DEC mechanism.

460
01:34:47,510 --> 01:35:04,630
現在係副主席胡志偉議員。多謝主席。誒，有關嗰個人手咧，如果聽頭先係常備所講咧，其實就係講緊增加五千個單位嘅建屋量，個規劃個設計嚟嘅。咁但係如果你睇翻長遠房屋策略嘅話咧，係。

461
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:24,920
喺二零一八一九年之後咧，如果按照個時間表要完成個工作嘅話咧，每年嘅建屋量咧將為四萬。我想問下，因為係廿八萬減咗，實質上已經做得到嘅八萬個咧，即係二十萬嘅。噉我想問下就係，而家你呢個人壽咧，其實係講緊係為兩萬個單位去設計幾多人壽。

462
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:44,930
手還是係為四萬個單位設計嘅人手咧？呢個第一樣嘢。第二個咧，其實我問咗好多次㗎啦。喺二零一八一九年之後，每年要做四萬個單位嘅土地，係咪已經到手？去令到就係話房屋署係需要呢一個嘅人力資源去做嘢，或者你最準確啲講，究竟喺二零一八一九年之後嘅可能？

463
01:35:44,930 --> 01:36:04,940
特別係近嗰兩三年，實質上你能夠每一年要預備嘅係即係地盤嘅係建屋量係幾多嘅數目咧？噉我哋先能夠評估得到實際情況係點樣樣。因為呢啲咧一路喺議會上面問過好多次咧，都得唔到答案。你只係叫我哋要對有信心嚇，對房署有信心噉樣樣。我想聽聽究竟。

464
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:22,590
究竟係即係啊，上畀你個信，我哋嘅信心係已經建基於實際嘅數字嘅。請講一講實際情況，多謝主席。白趙先生，Mr. Chairman，I think the honourable members got two very good points there. The first is I'm working on the current known targets. These are the targets that I have been given.

465
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:28,090
我係 aware under the long-term housing strategy that those targets will probably have to be increased.

466
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:48,380
但係，我 have not yet been increased. I have not yet been through the resource allocation exercise to secure additional resources for any new target. So this is what I'm targeting for at the moment. This will allow us to produce over the if there were no changes, 25,000 units of HOS and PRH.

467
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,120
per annum.

468
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,760
on for the next few years. Now.

469
01:36:54,300 --> 01:37:14,310
你問第二個問題關於 land supply， have we secured the land? We've secured the land for one hundred and seventy nine thousand units over the next ten years of public rental housing. Plus, we've also been allocated the land for seventeen thousand units which we're required to build on home ownership scheme. And we're looking. We've got land, but we still have to get rezoning and what have you for the further.

470
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:34,320
5,000. Thereafter, so within again, the targets that I have been given, that land has been identified and we're working to to secure. Of course, members are aware, we need to go to the district council to get support for rezoning. We need to sometimes go through the town planning process. We need to do a lot of the the work required.

471
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:54,330
for actual planning, site investigation, infrastructure and what have you. But the land itself is has been identified and earmarked for.我想澄清翻頭先啊，柏志高先生所講係咪即係話，而家你手上面有嘅土地係預備會興建到二十二萬個單位，同埋而家嘅人手編制係預備。

472
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:58,760
即係準備能夠係應付到呢一個嘅需求，當然額外需求另外再處理啦，多謝主席。

473
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:04,370
That's basically what we're working on. As I said, the the figures at the moment are the known targets.

474
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:12,380
I have to say, and I need to put down a marker. If the targets change, I'll be back here probably in a few months' time, looking for more resources.

475
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:28,390
但因為五年的lead time，我係working on，as Ada has said，the production for five years time。 in other words，2019/20 is the time timetable that we're working on。That's why these proposals relate to that time frame。

476
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:49,250
阿葉博軒議員，誒多謝主席。我本身都係委會嘅委員，不過我仲都特別提一提咧，就係誒我自己喺過往誒當居屋同埋公屋喺之前係一個最誒工程最多嘅時候咧，我亦係呢個誒房委會。

477
01:38:49,250 --> 01:39:09,260
佢誒嘅嘅建築小組嘅成員，後期我仲係主席，咁所以咧，其實對於現時咧，即係喺有關防防處要做好更多嘅興建工作嚟講，確實即係喺而家嘅人手上面係非常之即係人力。

478
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:29,270
係好唔足夠嘅，咁所以而家喺呢方面話，即係誒誒增加呢方面嘅職位嚟講咧，我係支持嘅。不過我就想問翻一下，即喺現時咧，即係發展同建築署嚟講咧，合共有增加十一個首長嘅職位，咁加翻想調回嘅誒呢個借調嘅職位，噉。

479
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:49,280
噉樣入口咧，呢而家呢一個處裏邊嘅首長級嘅職位，係咪已經係回復翻到二零零二年嘅時候停建居屋前呢方面嘅水平嘅咧？嚇咁誒，如果即係按每年要興建二萬個嘅單位。

480
01:39:49,280 --> 01:40:09,290
即係包括公屋同居屋啦，呢個目標之後嚟講咧，會唔會重要或者係仲需要增加幾多個嘅所長呢方面嘅誒職級嘅職位咧？我好希望咧，大家都即係都能夠知識，即係喺而家嘅興建裏邊一個樓宇嘅質素嚟講咧，係必。

481
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:29,300
需要保證嘅嚇誒，促呢個誒嗰個建築量，我哋當然亦係要達到目標啦。咁呢啲嚟講咧，係我即係如果喺人手唔夠嘅情況之下，我係擔憂嘅，因為之前嚟講咧，我哋對嗰個短裝事件都係一個非常慘痛嘅教訓啊。白小姐啊，白小姐，Mr. Chairman，I，I，thank。

482
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:47,670
The honourable member for that comment, because he's absolutely right. We we need to keep a very close eye on our manpower requirements. In fact, the structure that we've been putting in place over the last two and a half years is designed to produce the extra numbers that we've been targeted. That's primarily the home ownership scheme side.

483
01:40:47,950 --> 01:41:00,560
The extra 5,000 on the public rental housing scheme at the moment we'll absorb, but we'll have to look at that if there are further target changes. So that's something that we'll we will keep in mind. I can say that we are not yet.

484
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:20,850
Back to the same numbers that we had in two thousand and three and two thousand and four when the home ownership scheme programme was stopped, we're well below that. I think of something like eleven posts below that. So we're we're quite a way off that that that size of production. But I can say, and I particularly want to pick up on this, there are two things that I see.

485
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:28,340
係非常重要， for for our production colleagues and they know this. First is quality, as the honourable member has said. The second is safety.

486
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:38,740
I have made it very clear. I would rather slow down a programme than see accidents or people being killed. Safety is absolutely essential, just as is quality. Thank you.

487
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:55,100
好誒，而家呢個議題咧討論到呢一度就冇人再要求發言啦。我因此咧誒，我想問一問大家是否支持呢份文件咧誒嘅建議提交人事編制小組委員會去考慮。

488
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:04,040
冇反對嚇，噉啊，我哋同意啦。呢份文件咧，就係交去人事編制小組委員會考慮。

489
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:08,030
咁呢個議程咧就完啦，而家去到第七個議程。

490
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:17,820
就係公共出租單位以晾衣架取代插同色晾衣裝置資助計劃嘅建議。

491
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:31,460
立法會文件就C B括弧一六二二斜棟一三一四零七號文件，政府當局就公共出租單位以晾衣架取代插銅式晾衣架。

492
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:35,410
裝置資助計劃建議嘅文件。

493
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:46,550
噉樣咧就誒喺今日呈台咧就亦都咧係有我本人作為議員咧係提交咗誒有一份嘅文件。

494
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:53,460
啊！誒資料畀大家參考，就係誒上個星期六咧，我哋開個記者招待會。

495
01:42:53,740 --> 01:43:13,750
另外咧，亦都有咧係誒，我就提動議郭偉強和議嘅一個議案。咁咧就誒印發畀大家，呢個就係我議員個人嘅。咁而家咧就係請咧就係部門咧係介紹呢份文件。而家出席討論嘅咧，除咗係。

496
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,230
係。

497
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:17,650
柏照先生繼續在座之外咧，就係有。

498
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,860
房屋署副署長李國榮先生。

499
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:41,150
仲有咧，係房屋署助理署長陳少聰先生。咁而家我想睇下係部門係邊一位介紹咧？係係啊，柏九先生。

500
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:45,780
The replacement of laundry pole holders by laundry racks in public housing flats.

501
01:43:46,060 --> 01:44:06,070
for most of the public rental housing estates built before 2005, pole holders were installed to allow tenants to dry their laundry outdoors. In addition, laundry hangers are provided on the balcony ceilings of the flats in most of the standard type blocks as an extra clothes drying facility. This arrangement allows tenants to choose the facilities.

502
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:08,740
which best meet their needs and preferences.

503
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:20,640
從時間到時間，有啲建議將竿釣設施改為洗衣架，因為有些租客，特別係年長和病弱者，發現竹竿相對嚟講較難操作。

504
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:40,930
to keep pace with the rising expectation of tenants, we've recently reviewed the issue in the department, and proposed to introduce a voluntary pole holder drying facility replacement scheme, which has carefully taken into account considerations such as tenants' preferences, safety issues which have attracted public concern, and of course the optim.

505
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:42,620
use of public resources.

506
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:49,740
我們會 seek approval for the replacement scheme from the subsidised housing committee of the housing authority at its upcoming meeting.

507
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:59,310
I'd like to introduce Mr. S. T. Chan, and he will do a very short presentation for members, just to explain the situation in more detail. Thank you.

508
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,840
阿陳生係誒，多謝主席。

509
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:16,130
今日我哋嘅文件咧就係向委員咧就誒簡介公共出租單位誒以晾衣架取代插筒式晾衣裝置嘅資助計劃建議，盡可能濃縮嚇。好嘅，好好好。

510
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:27,670
咁誒，大家都知道喺二零零五年前咧，誒建成嘅公屋村咧都採用插桶式嘅晾衣裝置，即係俗稱嘅三支香啦嚇。

511
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:36,840
咁具有露台嘅屋邨嘅單位咧，一般我哋都有啲誒天花式嘅晾衣架作為額外嘅晾衫裝置嘅嚇。

512
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:45,830
咁喺二零一一年開始咧，我哋誒喺屋邨度提供咗平行型嘅晾衣架、晾衣竿為標準嘅設施咧。

513
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:51,800
咁二零零四年到零五年，我哋曾經推出過一次性嘅資助計劃嚇。

514
01:45:52,080 --> 01:46:03,980
誒，只要租户支付二百蚊咧，我哋係要安裝不鏽鋼嘅晾衣架，替代啲三支香嘅裝置嘅嚇。工程就會由房委會嘅承建商做誒進行嘅。

515
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:14,250
咁而家庭成員全部為六廿歲以上嘅長者，或者有醫護嘅專業人員嘅誒推薦咧，我哋都可以豁免嗰個安裝費嘅嚇。

516
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:23,290
誒日後以後咧，就租户亦都隨時可以根據房屋署嘅指引安裝誒獲批核嘅晾衣架嘅嚇。

517
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:44,150
因應租户部分租户對誒插桶式嘅晾衣裝置比拉輪式誒晾衣架誒比較難嘅使用咧，所以房委會咧計劃重推呢個資助嘅誒計劃。咁個資助計劃嘅嘅誒誒簡要就係我哋會提供資助安裝拉輪式嘅晾衣架。

518
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,680
以取代咗誒插筒式嘅晾衣裝置。

519
01:46:47,030 --> 01:47:07,040
咁咧誒，租户只需要誒畀三百蚊就得㗎啦。咁房委會咧大約就需要資助一千五百蚊。咁誒會安排承建商嚟安裝嘅。整個設計咧都係符合咗屋宇署建築物小型工程嘅規例嘅要求嚇。誒亦都會優先選用平衡式。

520
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:22,000
嘅設計大約長度會係最多係去到一點八米，但係喺空間唔足嘅情況之下咧，我哋就會採用垂直型嘅設計。噉我哋會採用即係不鏽鋼嘅晾衣架，誒，因為基於一個耐用性嘅問題。

521
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:28,220
咁呢度可以見到平衡式嘅設計同埋嗰個垂直式設計喺唔同嘅情況採用嘅嚇。

522
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:48,660
咁成個計劃嘅實施時間咧，噉我有別於上次咧，今次嘅計劃咧就會覆蓋所有誒插桶式嘅誒裝置公屋村，同埋咧我哋會係主動咁諮詢租户嘅誒意見，佢哋需唔需要更換，同埋亦都解釋咗豁免政策。

523
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,200
嗰個嘅措施。

524
01:47:50,480 --> 01:48:06,920
噉我哋預計咧，大約兩年時間咧，就會誒完成所有住户需要誒替換嘅安裝工程。暫時咧，我哋就唔設呢個計劃嗰個期限嘅，即係兩年之後，如果仍有租户係需要咧，我哋都仍然會係我哋誒安排嘅嚇。

525
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:27,210
成個資助計劃嘅優點就係符合環保嘅要求，唔會製造浪費。其實因應租户嘅選擇同安裝嘅，因為其實有部分嘅租户咧，頭先講過露台有天花嘅誒誒晾衣誒安排咧，咁其實佢哋有一部分誒比較中意喺室內誒個天花個晾衣嘅裝置嘅，亦都有部。

526
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:31,690
部分咧係誒比較喜歡喺客廳之外嘅誒。

527
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:47,750
以前核準佢哋安裝者係晾衣竿嘅嚇，咁另外亦都係能夠更加有效咁運用公共資源嘅，因為我哋誒估算過，如果全部一次性咁換曬咧，就需要九億元嘅，咁其實有啲係未必需要嘅嚇。

528
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,610
咁另外個安置力都係符合咗建築物嘅小型工程嘅規例嘅。

529
01:48:54,670 --> 01:49:14,680
咁根據房委會一貫嘅誒政策咧，即係我哋要喺豁免以下嘅人嘅三百蚊嘅安裝費嘅，包括全部家庭成員係六十歲嘅長者啦。咁受醫護專業推薦嘅殘疾人士咧，另外今次嘅建議，我哋都會擴展到豁免擴展邊度咧？所有領取誒綜合社會保

530
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:20,210
保障嘅誒援助嘅家庭，同埋領取租金援助嘅家庭嘅。

531
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:21,380
噉。

532
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:26,560
我哋咧就會喺誒校月咧就向資助房屋小組委員會誒。

533
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:34,860
建議建議頭先嗰個計劃，如果獲得通過咧，咁新資助計劃咧就我哋預計喺二零一四一五年展開嘅。多謝主席。

534
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:52,640
好誒，而家咧就係誒登記咗要發問嘅議員啦，我倒讀嘅次序嚇：梁耀忠、郭偉強、李國麟、梁美芬、梁志祥、謝偉俊，咁最後係我自己作為議員本人，啊，仲有啊。

535
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,020
誒。

536
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:58,310
張超豪，然後先到我啦嚇，啊，仲有仲有。

537
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,000
盧偉國。

538
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:06,120
最後先到我，咁咧就連問連答，每人三分鐘咧。

539
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,510
誒，搶梁耀忠議員。

540
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:28,850
主席，其實依一三支香咧，就大家知道咧，就你哋房屋署咧就死愛面子啦，一直都唔肯承認咧依個設計錯誤，有好多條人命咧都係噉樣，即係因為依三支香咧而係即係出現咗問題。但係可惜你哋咧都係堅持，即係唔係你哋嘅責任，你已經做一個好好好嘅一個嘅做法出嚟啦，噉樣。

541
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:45,530
咁但係今次咧，你哋咧就係用一個巧言令色啦嚇，即係話咧就即係都係自願嘅。如果住户咧就誒即係唔中意都可以唔做嘅噉樣樣，亦都係咧有要畀三百蚊噉樣樣。噉我覺得咧，你哋即係做啲嘢做咗真係好唔徹底咯。

542
01:50:45,870 --> 01:51:03,060
點解你係全部係即係完全做曬同埋強制同佢做咗去咧？咁依個係一個最大嘅問題嚟嘅。咁所以我呢度咧就想問兩個問題，主席。第一問題咧，因為你而家今次咧，你人哋畀三百蚊，咁究竟嗰個晾衣架咧，將來咧屬於邊個嘅咧？

543
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:23,350
即係我有錢畀㗎嘛，係咪咁？係咪我都有份咧？如果第有機會，如果我搬走嘅時候，咪我我有機會。如果我中意嘅時候，可唔可以拆埋走咧？係咪咁可以咧？如果我當然咧，我唔拆你就唔會拆㗎啦，係咪先啦？嚇，即係你都有幾錢㗎嘛，係咪咁？所以第一個問題，誰誰熟嘅依個依個噉嘅浪三假？如果我畀三百蚊之後。

544
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:43,800
但係個問題咧，房主你有冇估計到咧？就話譬如如果而家你係自願嘅，要畀三十蚊，有啲人唔中意入，唔中意畀錢啦，噉樣係唔做啦噉樣。咁到到未來，當佢搬走咗之後，噉就新嘅入住嗰時，噉佢又想做啦。噉你會唔會同佢做咧？你同佢做嗰時候係咪亦都係用依一個三百蚊咧？

545
01:51:43,970 --> 01:52:03,980
噉你成本價貴咗咯。當當時嚟講係在做嘅，因為因為你唔係一次過啊嘛。因為而家一次過做咧，個成本一定平嘅。而家嚟講係噉，將來如果個別做嘅又會貴啲，噉你又會唔會係要人哋畀唔止畀三百蚊咧？而你自己付出嘅係咪又唔止千五蚊咧？如果係噉樣樣嘅話咧，你對於呢個嘅即係估計。

546
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,940
又點樣咧？

547
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:06,230
邊位答啊？

548
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:09,080
阿李國榮。

549
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,560
司山，當家主席，誒。

550
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:32,050
多謝阿阿梁議員呢兩條問題。誒，首先答咗嗰個嗰個晾衫架啫。如果個住户咧參與咗呢個計劃之後咧，嗰個架誰屬咁？其實咧嗰個架咧一定係屬於房房房委會㗎啦，因為係房委會嘅一個裝置。房委會咧，我畀錢喎。房委會係會負責往後嘅維。

551
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:46,390
維修同埋，如果咧隔咗幾年之後有需要更換嘅話咧，房委會亦都會負責更換嘅。咁所以成個嘅理念咧，就係話根本上咧係一個象徵式收翻費，希望唔好濫用噉樣嘅一個概念嚟嘅啫。

552
01:52:46,670 --> 01:53:06,680
噉就誒第二個問題誒嗰個誒，如果嗰個住户即係如果要搬去第二個誒誒，即係騰翻出嚟嘅時候咧，咁如果係誒我哋其實而家嗰個費用咧，亦都唔係諗住落吊船直接做，因為我哋要問準嗰啲嘅誒住户同佢哋個別咁做，其實而家嗰個。

553
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:26,690
收費咧係貴咗，原因咧就係因為個別個別每一個即係單位咁去做嘅，咁所以咧就算第日佢騰空咗出嚟咧，個別新嘅住户需要做嘅時候咧，其實個費用都係相若。我哋已經係住咗㗎啦。多謝主席。誒，我想咧就係為咗日誒跟住好多人發言咧，都容易。

554
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:46,700
討論，既然咧就剛才李國榮副處長答足答覆梁耀忠議員嘅第一個問題咧，就講得好清楚。呢個裝置係房屋署嘅設備，係房屋署嘅設備。既然預署咁點解唔房屋署出埋錢佢咧，而收？

555
01:53:46,700 --> 01:54:06,710
租住户嗰三百蚊咧，我作為主席，我都想關注呢個問題。都係防止濫用啊，但係點濫用啫？人哋咪嚟自願嗰個點濫用咧？誒，我想咧就係，既然副處長都講呢個係房屋署嘅裝置啊，咁點解仲要收租户三百蚊咧？不如房屋署出賣咁咪得咯？

556
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:18,220
何況你日後頭先誒副長你都講啦，日後個維修保養都係房屋署係負責㗎啦，呢個亦都係好清楚啦。同埋，主席有啲問題問咧，我畀咗錢都唔係屬於我嘅。

557
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:36,030
佢頭先講佢都係房屋主莊子個税熟嗰個答㗎。我係畀咗三萬蚊㗎喎。咁所以我就係提出咧，佢嗰個酒樽寫畀三萬蚊畀我。因此你就唔應該收錢啦，就唔使再退翻三萬蚊啦。係咪呢個？你計計話三萬蚊咧？如果就我搬走時，我唔攞走嗰時候。

558
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:56,320
係啊！你係咪可以再補充下？啊，主席或者我再講清楚啲。誒，其實主要嚟講咧，即係誒，頭先誒同事喺嗰個誒幻燈片嗰度都有講過，唔係每一個住户咧，我哋都覺得佢係需要一個新嘅晾衫架。為咗避免浪費大量嘅公佈公幣咧，其實我哋係會。

559
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:16,330
問每一個嘅住户，佢哋願意咧防住先，會做呢個嘅裝置。咁所以咧，嗰三百蚊係一個象徵式。如果唔係嘅話咧，我哋恐怕每一個住户都會舉手咧，就係話你幫我安咧，你幫我換咗佢啦。咁呢個牽涉大量嘅嘅嘅公幣，同埋造成一個沉重，講緊係九億嘅一個財務嘅負擔。

560
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:36,340
咁但係當住户佢舉手話我願意做，我有需要愛呢一個晾衫架嘅時候咧，咁其實房署咧基本上嗰個文件都有講到咧，整個晾衫架係一千八百蚊嘅。咁其實咧房署今次咧係願意嗰個支付八成以上，誒三百蚊係一個象徵式嘅收費。咁所以其實。

561
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:56,350
呢個成個嘅理念咧，房署用得公公公幣去做呢個晾衫架咧，其實嗰個係一個成為即係温一做咗之後咧，就係成為一個誒房署房委會嘅裝置喺嗰個喺嗰個喺嗰個誒誒單位入邊嘅。咁其實你牽涉到譬如你話誒誒會唔會攞翻走？我亦都相信呢個咧係一個較為假設性。

562
01:55:56,350 --> 01:56:06,110
一個問題，我諗如果拆要安咧，即係都唔止三百蚊嚇，都係主席。誒，我就因為大家仲可以繼續問啦嚇，不過。

563
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:14,080
房屋署咧，既然係好清楚，大家都聽清楚，呢個係房屋署嘅裝置。

564
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:15,800
我作為。

565
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:26,920
主席，我啲唔認為咧，係應當係要收呢個住户嘅三百蚊，尤其是過往嘅七個月已經死咗五個人㗎啦。

566
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:33,070
居民付出嗰個生命更加係無價嘅，咁而家接落去啊，各位強議員。

567
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:34,440
誒。

568
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:39,690
有聲啊！有聲啦，都係主席。嗯。

569
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:59,980
五問遊字，我一聽咧，聽完就覺得好荒唐啊！第一，即係既然係房屋誒房屋房屋處嘅物品啊，亦都係房屋處提供嘅設施，點解要收錢？呢個真係真係好冇理由嘅説法。另外第二樣嘢咧，就係其實我諗大家都認同啊，呢三支香咧，其實係藝。

570
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:19,990
無論係對於長者或者對於年青人嚟講，都係危險㗎啊！因為過去死嘅人唔單止係長者，我諗相信大家都知道，亦都有誒稍為壯年或者中年嘅。咁既然係噉嘅話，點解仲要分門別類咧？就話長者唔使錢，其他就要錢。另外，你所講嘅三百蚊。

571
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:40,000
係防止話誒唔環保啊，或者濫用咧呢個説法係講唔通嘅。而家好多時政府嘅情況就係咁啦，大政策係啱嘅、好嘅，做嘢係好嘅，但係咧我哋嘅執行部門咧就轉牛角尖，諗埋啲唔應該諗嘅嘢。講真，之前零五年嗰次你畀二百蚊。

572
01:57:40,000 --> 01:58:00,010
已經少人換啦。你而家仲要畀到三百蚊，你諗住有幾多人換咧？咁但係問題就係大家都覺得係安全嘅問題。我講個例子畀你聽。啱啱我喺華富村咧都做咗個街站，有個街坊就話：我搬入嚟嗰陣時，我已經換曬全屋嘅電線啦。咁但係你哋唔知隔咗五六年咧，就話啱啱屋村又話大型換。

573
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:05,620
換電線，噉佢覺得好擾民啊！佢話：我都換曬啦，你唔好嚟煩我。就算你免費，都唔好入嚟換。

574
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:25,150
咁引申過嚟呢個晾衫架都係一個情況。其實你入屋，佢要搬開曬啲嘢畀你搞呢，搞路咧，又要約個時間咧，已經好麻煩㗎啦。你唔需要收佢三百蚊，都唔係個個搶住換，就係咁簡單。唔該，你連三百蚊都唔好收啦。嗰三百蚊如果用嗰個環保理由咧，係完全講唔通。

575
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:37,310
唔可行就索性唔好收，唔好搞咁多嘢啦。至於你誒頭先啊副處長應承話之後個維修保養都係房署負責，我哋表示歡迎。多謝主席。

576
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,780
有冇回應？

577
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:46,250
Maybe I'll comment, Mr. Chairman. This this notion of of

578
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:54,480
requiring a payment is is not a new notion as members are very well aware that was also part of the previous programme. What we're trying to do is balance.

579
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:55,490
你 know。

580
01:58:55,770 --> 01:59:15,780
We were talking earlier in this meeting about resources, and every time we have to devote resources to one area, it doesn't get spent on some other area. So it has to be borne in mind. 阿秘書長啊，其實如果講到安全咧，就唔應該提資源嘅，即係我哋喺勞工界，我講職安健咧，我哋就一定係話老闆要提供安全嘅facility，即係。

581
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:35,790
安全嘅設備畀個員工先嘅個員工用唔用咧？唔係老闆話事。當然個老闆要叫員工用啦，但係唔係用唔用唔係買唔買嗰樣嘢嘅理由。總之，老闆由上而下，總之你上面覺得安全就要提供呢個設施，就係咁簡單。唔好畀其他嘢框死啦。本身一個好嘅政策嚟㗎，全部換曬佢啦。同埋誒。

582
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:46,930
講真，你想全部換曬啫。講真，自己自己屋企入邊有晾衫架嗰啲，都唔想你入去煩佢，唔想佢換啊。嗰個已經好大嘅誘因啦，唔使三百蚊啊！阿秘書長。

583
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:50,380
趕緊啦，必須趕。Very quickly.

584
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:58,570
this issue of safety, I think we have to leave to one side because fundamentally our position is that they are up to standard. Having said that,

585
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:18,860
You've also got to bear in mind that in many of these flats, they actually have internal drying facilities as well. The fact is that there are already alternatives for many people, so it isn't an absolute requirement to replace all of them. And that's where we're starting this whole approach from. But I agree with the member: safety can't be paid for. That's that's a separate issue.

586
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:19,480
説嗰個。

587
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:23,450
誒，接住係啊，李國麟議員。

588
02:00:23,790 --> 02:00:43,800
啊，都係主席誒。其實呢個咧係一個即係有個需要同埋個原則，就話即係我一定要你換曬問題啦。咁呢個可能即係好多爭論嘅。咁但係即係問題就係話你係咪需要嘥九億錢，或者用九億嘅公帑係必須換曬，而可能有啲圖有啲嚇誒喺公屋住緊嘅朋友咧，佢覺得唔需要嘅咧。咁呢個就係即係我覺得今次咧，我係贊成你嘅做法。

589
02:00:43,800 --> 02:01:02,440
咁但係我問題咧在於一樣嘢就係，誒有庫户嘅文件冇提到，如果庫户又想換，噉你點做咧？噉係咪應該資助佢啊？定係話應該收個雙倍錢咧？噉我呢點都注意啦。我就原則上，我覺得咧就係，如果係公屋庫嘅時候，無理由房署咧係要資助佢嘅。嚇，睇下你點答。

590
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,400
一樣意思啦。

591
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:24,390
係啊，部門邊個回應係？啊，主啊，主席誒，多謝議員呢個呢個誒，我哋個計劃咧，整個個設計咧，總之如果係住户咧，佢係想我哋安裝嘅話咧，我哋都係一輪咧收三百蚊，長程式呢個收費，多謝主席。我將係住喺一塔並埋。

592
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,600
係。

593
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,890
誒時間仲有喎。

594
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:50,210
即係話，即係如果佢係高庫嘅，咁呢個方面嘅設備咧，都係一樣冇分別㗎啦。佢都係一樣收返佢咁多錢，都係裝翻噉嘅，即係到，因為變咗係你哋覺得喺呢個事件上咧，係庫都會津貼嘅喎，係嘛？誒，我我哋個我哋嘅設計咧，就希望咧都誒係簡單而而即係方。

595
02:01:50,210 --> 02:02:03,740
方便啲住户啦，誒講緊都係一個象徵式嘅收費，咁所以咧誒亦都付户嗰個數目咧會會跳上跳落嚇，咁所以我哋我哋用一個簡單咧，暫時嚟講都係個設計都係用三百蚊一時同人都係絕跡。

596
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:25,760
接住係梁美芬議員，係主席。誒頭先柏志高處長都收到我哋喺誒誒愛民村同埋西九龍一批公屋居民嘅信。咁咧大家咧頭先都聽到話象徵式收費三百蚊。咁其實咧，首先咧，我想話。

597
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:34,460
問下咧，就係房署最緊要就係係咪想做？想做嘅原因，即係我哋睇到係咪應該兩樣嘢，一個就係方便，一個就係安全。

598
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:54,880
人命關天咧，我認為安全係最重要嘅。咁咧就誒，點解仲要收一個象徵式？係咪象徵式收費？我就問嗰啲街坊咧，係唔係咧？到時候就係有一啲人就因為呢三百蚊就唔做，咁又慳翻一啲咧噉。噉我想講一個，即係我最近做咗一個民調，就喺外。

599
02:02:54,880 --> 02:03:14,890
民村嘅嗱，喺愛民村咧，我哋咧就係調查咗二百三十五個居民。咁裏邊咧有八十個percent係六十歲以上嘅長者，其中咧六十八個percent咧仲係喺三支香，即係用三支香去去晾衫嘅。咁咧有六十個percent表示咧個窗口太高，經常咧仲要用矮凳仔。

600
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:34,900
同埋咧，成日覺得咧好危險嘅咁咧，就如果問佢啦，誒，但係咧政府資助一千五百蚊，你要出三百蚊，佢點嘅反應咧？個反應咧就係只有二十個percent咧係yes，即係支持五十個percent咧就話一定唔會做二十九個percent咧就係話會考。

601
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:35,420
考慮。

602
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:55,710
咁此外咧，就係話，如果係政府咧係將佢誒全部資助嘅話，個情況係點咧？全部資助嘅話咧，就會有六十三個percent表示咧好願意做，有十九個percent咧話唔會做，有一成八，即係十八個percent咧，就係咧話會考慮。

603
02:03:55,710 --> 02:04:15,720
咁呢一個咧就係嗰啲公屋居民咧，就係想我交畀處長。誒，三支香真係暗藏危機，要求房署全面取替嗱。嗰個咧就唔係由得佢哋揀與唔揀，其實咧牽涉到一啲噉嘅公屋誒，係牽涉到人身安全使用嘅。

604
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:20,470
時候好容易發生危險咧。其實我哋應該咧，就係。

605
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:40,760
主動鼓勵佢哋要做，就唔係咧，特登咧就係扣住三百蚊，等佢咧自己去決定唔做，你又再慳埋嗰千五蚊，絕對唔應該係噉嘅。一條命都係多嘅，處長真係好有人係因為三支香而係唔小心使用，係會係發生意外。

606
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:57,620
係冇命㗎，所以我認為咧，既然都已經係考慮到呢個需要，你係應該用一個政策性，就唔好咧又再列出中環户啊、老人啊噉，而係真係要佢全面使用。我哋要嘅係安全，我希望處長可以回答一下。

607
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:18,420
李處長，I don't think you can put a price on safety. The three hundred is not about a price on safety. So let's make that very, very clear. The three hundred is for an entirely different reason. That is to make sure that the people who are applying and who want it, and your own figures actually confirm this, that they're the people.

608
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:30,470
People who really feel that they need these changes, safety has to be a personal decision, and we certainly would never put a price on safety. That is, as far as I'm concerned, the most important thing in this project and in construction projects.

609
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:32,510
梁志祥議員。

610
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:53,490
係，主席就誒三支香就唔使講，都係誒大家都覺得危險。即係其實一直以嚟都提出咗呢個即係要求嘅，即係能唔能夠幫佢誒即係更換或者係重新安裝嗰啲安全嘅誒，例如好似啲平衡啊，或者係誒即係誒噉嘅新型。

611
02:05:53,490 --> 02:06:13,500
嘅嘅晾衫架啦，咁零五年做咗之後咧，其實就一批即係嗰啲住户咧，係真真正改裝咗。不過即係我就誒始終覺得咧，房署亦都係一直以嚟咧喺呢方面咧，似乎即係對呢一啲嘅誒要求咧，似乎係睇得比較輕率一啲，只係簡單。

612
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:19,730
單自作咧，即係你有噉嘅需求幫你做，即係而家提出嚟嘅方案都係噉樣咯。我諗。

613
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:25,350
的確令到咧啲住户，包括我哋啦，我哋語言都係失望嘅，因為。

614
02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:34,070
呢一個如果你用一個安全個角度睇咧，係必須做。但係如果你覺得係需求上去做咧，就唔使做嘅。

615
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:54,360
咁講真話，如果你冇需求，你都三支香都已即係做樓嘅時候都冇呢個設計啦，係嘛？即係根本冇乜需要動三條棍畀人哋啊，即係留翻個桶畀人哋去去去掛衫嘅。咁即係話咧，呢一個咧係必須做同安全咧係並行嘅。噉我唔應我唔覺得應該咧。

616
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,670
誒，住户自己話要做啦，咁先同你做。

617
02:06:57,950 --> 02:07:17,960
誒嗱，我想問一問咧。當然頭先阿黃阿黃國興主席，你講就話喂做誒零五年做嘅事做好鬼少啫噉樣。噉我想知道咧，就零五年嘅時候三二百蚊啊，要求做嘅誒即係主動要求做嘅住户，究竟個數量啊，相對係幾多？咁另外咧。

618
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:28,630
就你頭先你哋講咧，有幾種情況咧係豁免收費嘅，呢啲會唔會唔使講你哋同佢做咧？即係唔使提出申請，你已經幫佢做咗咧？

619
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:49,630
誒，署方阿李國榮生，好啊，當家主席。誒，多謝阿阿梁議員嘅提問。誒，對上一次零四年嗰個嘅計劃底下咧，我哋嘅數據咧就顯示咧，大約係有五萬户嘅居民咧，就係誒更換咗嗰個嘅晾衫架嘅。噉就我我喺呢度想，淨係加多一。

620
02:07:49,640 --> 02:08:09,650
即係一個嘅誒，再嘅回應咧，就係話其實我哋除咗嗰三支香喺呢啲舊嘅誒屋村誒嗰個晾衫設，即係喺個晾衫設施啦。其實有七成以上咧，呢啲舊型屋村咧，佢除咗三支香之外咧，喺露台係有個晾衫架嘅。咁呢啲嘢包括咩？

621
02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:29,660
雙塔式大廈啦、長形大廈啦，同埋工字大廈啦，呢個正正就係引證。頭先同事咧都有講到，就係話咧，點解有啲住户佢冇要求喺上次嗰個嘅計劃底下咧去更換個晾衫架？原因就係話有居民咧，亦都會係利用咗佢而家現有露台嗰啲嘅晾衫設施。

622
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:30,530
多謝主席。

623
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:51,780
誒時間咧差唔多，就而家我哋秘書處嘅同事咧就派緊咧我修改咗嘅動議，但係喺我提交畀秘書去印嘅時候咧，我同時又收到咧誒張超紅議員、馮檢基議員咧兩位嘅修訂。

624
02:08:51,780 --> 02:09:11,790
我又發覺你哋提議嘅修訂咧，同我自己嘅修訂嘅字眼係殊途同歸，都係嗰三個字，即係安裝及噉。一間去到嗰度，阿張超榮議員，你可以讀出嚟嚇。噉我即係呢度，因為我派畀大家咧，我説明一下嚇。噉就誒，而家繼續討論。咁而家係。

625
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:13,620
到到謝偉俊議員。

626
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:34,160
多謝主席。主席，我好奇怪，因為我記得誒印象中咧，我就喺蘇屋村大嘅時候咧，就一路都已經嗰陣時真係四指定五指香啦，都好多呢啲經驗嘅。即係我一夠高嗰陣時，已經係主動幫手咧，就要屋企即係唔好媽媽阿婆、阿嫲嗰啲去晾衫，因為呢個係其實好危險嘅一樣嘢嚟嘅。咁喺剛才聽到秘書長。

627
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:54,170
想講咧，似乎咧，佢就係講得好小心。佢話政府嘅立場個position就係呢啲三張仲係安全噉。當然呢，我明白點解你要咁講，因為如果你話唔安全嘅話，就大件事。因為以往咁多宗案例咧，你哋可能賠到真係特別。如果喺美國咧，政府呢個立場咧係非常之危險嘅，既有一個明白到有意外。

628
02:09:54,170 --> 02:10:14,180
嘅先例多宗先例，更加有咧，你哋而家知道呢個風險，而更加第三樣嘢，你哋主動要求咧，係包括而家零五年又好，今次好咧，係希望可以取代呢啲噉嘅三支香嘅設施。噉嘅情況之下咧，如果你哋唔真係就呢個問題咧，係切切實實咁主動地將所有呢啲危險有可能發生。

629
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:34,190
意外或者係導致人哋發生意外嘅誘因咧，去剔除佢嘅話咧，其實你哋如果喺香港算在好少少啦，冇呢個噉嘅所謂懲罰式嘅賠償。如果喺美國咧，就賠到政府破產都有份噉嘅情況之下咧，我希望政府考慮下咧，係咪應該用一個所謂即係opt in opt out option咧，即係一個選擇性嘅。

630
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:54,200
可能到時係所有人咧，除非佢哋選擇係唔做嘅，甚至簽埋書面確認咗明知風險下佢哋唔想做嘅，你先至唔幫佢做咧。呢個先係徹底嘅保障。否則話咧，如果你明知有風險，而由於不論你哋，我明白到政府平衡嗰個所謂公帑嘅問題咧，但係你要收錢啊，甚至乎係都好似表面上。

631
02:10:54,200 --> 02:11:14,210
唔係好主動地顧及佢哋安全咧，係要求佢哋做咧，噉嘅後遺症咧，覺得你哋將來上法庭遇到啲案件嘅時候咧，係好難去難辭其咎嘅。我希望多個咧就誒，我明白到公堂係需要小心運用，亦都要平衡。但係今日情況之下咧，既然你哋咁強調話係誒安全係冇代價嘅，噉嘅情況之下，咪應該更加。

632
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:34,220
小心佢主動地要求所有市民，如果佢哋除非係表面上簽清楚、明白到風險，甚至封咗佢唔用而嘅情況之下，先至唔做咧。否則嘅話咧，你係應該係要主動地要求佢哋係要做。而事實上咧，我唔想問問，有少少時間制，你哋嗰千百蚊咧，當中個物料幾多錢，人工幾多？

633
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:54,230
錢咧，如果既然係人工係可以係大規模做，可以省時省錢嘅話咧，係咪應該更加需要行我嗰度變個方向咧？唔該，主席。係邊位答？阿李國榮署長。多謝主席。我諗嗰個千百蚊咧，大約都係誒一半一半啦，即係誒物料啊同埋人工都係各半。誒，因為而家因應翻係要先。

634
02:11:54,230 --> 02:12:14,240
誒，即係去探討嗰啲居民自己嘅自願性。即係我對唔住打斷，大規模做會唔會可以減少好多好多費用？我正正想講就係因為我哋要先誒徵詢嗰啲住户佢哋自己嘅意願去做咧，變咗可能即係未必會同即係同一時期咧大批做埋喺同一座樓，即係會因應翻唔同個住。

635
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:34,250
户嘅需要噉，所以變咗我哋個價都已經預咗咧，未必可以攞到一個最即係最平個個價錢咁解。我想我想部門答埋阿謝偉俊議員頭先提出嘅問題咧，係非常重要嗰個問題。佢問你哋咧係可唔可以出個問卷畀住户佢選擇噉啊？清楚嘅質。

636
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:36,410
責任啦，噉你做唔做呢個咧？

637
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:48,190
Mr. Chairman, as I say, I'm prepared to look at finding out what members' choices. But I need to point out there's a practical issue here.

638
02:12:48,870 --> 02:13:08,880
Our experience with these mandatory replacements, like the window replacement, we cannot get one hundred percent. Unfortunately, some of our tenants simply will not let us in to do the work. So it's not about us being able to require people to take these things on. They really have got to have a choice. So that's where we're basically coming from anyway.

639
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:28,890
秘書長，我認為秘書長，我認為謝偉俊議員嗰個誒觀點係非常之重要，就係個住户佢自己嘅選擇，佢要定唔要，並且書面就唔係我哋而家要求你要攞百分之一百嘅支持，人去做唔做，唔係噉。

640
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:40,210
噉樣，所以咧，我認為咧，既然秘書長話聽取我哋意見咧，謝偉俊議員個意見，你認真要考慮，好嘛？而家繼續係張志雄議員。

641
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:42,300
係，Mr. Chairman。

642
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:57,840
係阿B章，你講下。Mr. Chairman，as I said，we will be issuing forms to all of our tenants to ask them if they want this，so in in a written form。so you know this is the approach that we're taking。as I say，you have to ask them，you can't impose it on them。

643
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:19,240
好，張志雄議員。多謝主席。即係呢個晾衫裝置咧，一個月內連續發生致命嘅意外，而且咁多年嚟，我真係都唔知道局方咧有冇統計過，究竟真係有幾多人因為呢個噉嘅裝置咧而係即係意外。

644
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:23,610
喪失佢嘅生命，咁呢個本身係一個安全嘅問題，主席。

645
02:14:24,230 --> 02:14:26,660
既然係一個安全嘅問題咧，

646
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:41,550
其實就對唔住，我都唔覺得呢個係一個選擇，即係呢個裝置本身係有問題，而呢個問題咧導致到居民咧有機會因為用呢個裝置。

647
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:44,810
而產生一個致命嘅意外嘅。

648
02:14:45,090 --> 02:14:47,400
咁呢件事係重要嘅。

649
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:57,300
噉我覺得咧，原則上咧，政府係有責任，即係房委會係有責任，去將呢啲嘅裝置全面更替。

650
02:14:57,700 --> 02:15:17,710
咁更替咗一個新嘅裝置咧，必然係要安全同埋實用啦。咁如果佢哋認為呢個所謂拉繩式嘅係一個噉嘅裝置咧，噉就政府根本就係有一個責任去將佢全面更替，而不收分毫。將來嗰個維修、保養、更替咧，當然。

651
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:37,720
亦都係要由房委會負責，呢個就係即係喺房屋委員會提供公共屋邨呢個嘅責任嘅一部分嚟嘅。咁正如所有嘅公共設施，無論喺屋裏邊或者屋外邊咧，喺成條邨嘅管理咧，誒都係關於即係房委會嘅事。咁所以誒，主席。

652
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,990
你同啊？

653
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:59,520
郭偉強議員嗰個修訂咧，即係我同馮劍基都覺得咧，係應該包括咗個裝置本身。噉啊誒，但係我想政府睇即係睇睇佢哋自己嘅立場，對於呢個責任佢哋願唔願承擔。好誒，既然咧啊張超雄議員都講到噉。

654
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:04,470
個問題，我話幾多讀一讀個議案，或者一間都唔使嘥時間再讀呢個議案啦。

655
02:16:04,750 --> 02:16:09,090
因為其實幾個議員動議好、修訂好，都係殊途同歸嘅。

656
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:29,720
促請房屋署為參與以晾衣架取代插銅色晾衣架裝置資助計劃的租户免費安裝及提供日後的維修保養。噉就我同埋郭偉強就係原動議，張昭雄、馮檢。

657
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:34,400
機其後作出修訂，嚇殊途同歸。咁而家請部門回應。

658
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:37,710
嗯，嗯，Mr. Chairman，嗯。

659
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:52,440
Obviously, we we will take members' views and reflect them to the subsidised housing committee when they when they consider this issue. Because obviously, this is still a proposal, and that's one of the reasons we wanted to come here so we can reflect members' views to them.

660
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,500
It's their decision at the end of the day.

661
02:16:56,110 --> 02:17:16,120
誒主席，呢個都誒當然係房委會嘅決定啦，但係呢個都係政府嘅責任嚟㗎嘛。即係凡親關於居民安全嘅問題，個裝置本身係會導致意外咧，呢樣嘢我哋係不能接受。秘書長係咪應當房屋主承擔啲嘅責任啊？

662
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:16,490
係。

663
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:18,050
miss。

664
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:25,770
Mr. Chairman, as I said before, if equipment that we provided is used properly, it should be fairly safe.

665
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:46,160
The question and this is the difficulty we have: people unfortunately do fall from a height, but it cannot always be traced back to one particular incident. People have fallen from a height when they don't have pole holders. They've fallen from a height when they do. It's not as simple A plus B equals C. Unfortunately, I wish it were.

666
02:17:46,230 --> 02:18:04,800
The reality is that we feel this approach allows us to deal with the problems most directly with the people who are most in need of the replacement. But as I've said before, I'm not attempting, and I certainly would never claim that you can put a price on safety. Safety has to be the first option, and I absolutely agree with you on that.

667
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:16,150
However, I need to have a methodology to determine which people need to have these things replaced, and that's this is the methodology we feel is best served for that purpose.

668
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:24,730
我認為咧，其實處方咧就死口都係唔會認，係有問題㗎啦。一如咧謝偉俊議員所講。

669
02:18:25,010 --> 02:18:30,700
咁咧，我哋繼續就大家誒按照登記咗次，就繼續發表，好嘛？

670
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:33,850
就盧偉國議員。誒，多謝主持。

671
02:18:34,350 --> 02:18:48,830
就其實咧，就提供嘅文件裏邊嘅第四頁嘅詩段咧，佢就講到好清楚，就係安裝晾衣架現已被列為建築物小型工程規例下受規管嘅小型工程。

672
02:18:49,210 --> 02:18:55,180
噉啊！等等，咁亦都咧就講到就話要確保呢個晾衣架嘅品質同埋耐久性。

673
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,300
嗱，如果以，

674
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:01,300
誒晾衣架，既然咧。

675
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:06,330
安裝新晾衣架要受呢個建築物小型工程規管。

676
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:11,380
噉啊，當然出發點咧就係好重要，就為安全、為品質。

677
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:25,520
咁如果相比之下咧，傳到嘅呢一種即係三支香嘅咧，就根本就同而家所講嘅浪煙解，同安全性嚟講就冇得比㗎啦。因為大家都公認咧，三支香係非常之危險。

678
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:34,240
除咗晾衫嗰人之外咧，你嗰你嗰支竹晾住嗰嗰嗰嗰秋衫跌落街，導致意外。

679
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:52,800
哦，或者咧，就算好彩唔做到人命啊，使到下邊嘅街坊驚嚇一餐咧，呢啲情況即係我細個喺公屋大啊，都屢見不鮮㗎啦。所以咧，既然我哋而家對於落醫架，我哋咁重視咧，我就認為咧。

680
02:19:53,080 --> 02:20:13,090
呢啲呢個插桶式嘅晾衣裝置啊，呢三支香咧根本就應該要取替。如果我哋可以畀租户有個選擇咧，其實唯一選擇嘅狀況就係話佢根本唔會晾衫，或者佢晾衫有其他嘅新嘅取替安全嘅方法啦，再唔用呢三支香啦，噉佢。

681
02:20:13,090 --> 02:20:19,180
就可以唔選擇，即係唔裝房署提供嘅晾衣架，即係我覺得呢個先至合邏輯啊嘛。

682
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:39,550
哦，即係我認為嗰個選擇性咧，只係噉樣嘅啫。而係咧，歸根到底咧，就係話三支香咧，根本就應該要要要取替㗎啦。所以呢個咧，我覺得係誒，我想問嘅問題咧，就係其實頭先有有好多問題都係圍繞話再收唔收嗰三百蚊啦。

683
02:20:39,550 --> 02:20:58,690
咁或者誒係局方咪都可以畀一啲誒資料咧，就係唔再講翻晾衣架啦。有其他嘅例子係一啲必須嘅誒嘅設施，又要租户咧畀一部分費用嘅，呢啲咪可以作為一種誒，即係你呢種建議做法嘅一個理據咧，噉樣。

684
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:00,880
邊兩位回應？

685
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:21,280
啊，李生，啊，主席，多謝主席，啊，多謝啊，盧，啊，盧議員嗰啲個提問。我誒至於誒阿盧議員嘅意見咧，我尊重啦。我想再重新翻誒有個嘅資料嘅提供咁解嘅啫。誒呢啲嘅舊型屋邨除咗佢有三支香咧，其實七成以上嘅單位咧喺露台亦都有。

686
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:32,640
個架咧，畀佢可以插幾枝嘅竹嚟落嚟曬浪嘅。咁根據我哋即係屋邨嘅經驗咧，亦都有好多嘅居民唔用三支香，用呢種嘅方式。多謝主席。

687
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:53,280
誒，咪冇冇答到我。其實畀機會你申辯㗎啦，就係話咧，其他嘅情況有啲必要嘅設施，你幫佢安裝咧，都係要收少部分費用嘅。噉你可以作為一個辯解理由啊。幫你選擇，即係唔舉例子就算啦嚇。誒，佢唔答咪算啦，係嘛？誒，各位，因為咧就係嗰個我哋。

688
02:21:53,280 --> 02:22:03,320
仲有幾分鐘咧就夠鐘，所以咧我要徵詢大家同意咧，就畀我延長嗰個法定時間最多十五分鐘，好嘛？

689
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:15,540
好，咁而家排緊隊，我倒讀嘅次序就係我最後啦嚇，就李卓人、胡志偉、馮檢基到我係第一輪嚇，第二輪咧有郭偉強，仲有冇人想發言？

690
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:21,990
如果冇咧，畫一條線啦，就喺第二輪各位強講完之後，就係我哋就去處理啲洞。

691
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:27,460
嚇！第一輪都未問我，點會舉手講定第二輪咧？噉係嘛？

692
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:37,210
係咪我哋嗰三個應該有機會舉手第二輪啊？誒，噉我哋處理曬第一輪先啦，好唔好？啊，因為你都未舉手問，好得李卓仁議員。

693
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:46,240
誒，都係主席，即係我覺得頭先柏志高嘅講法咧，其實即係喺度有啲死雞撐飯蓋嘅意味喺度，即係。

694
02:22:46,520 --> 02:23:06,530
即係佢，佢點都唔肯承認咧。三支香咧係釀成啲悲劇噉，好似佢話啊，有啲高處墮下，有好多因由。但係事實上啊，我唔係話次次高處墮下都係因為個三支香。但係事實上，事實上係有因為浪三而。

695
02:23:06,530 --> 02:23:26,540
係高處墮下，咁呢個事實你唔可以唔認。咁當然，主席你嘅講法就係：，唉，佢係唔認㗎啦，噉樣嚇。噉啊，即係但係，我覺得呢個我哋作為議員，我哋要喺度講清楚。就算房署係唔認，但係事實你係唔可以咧，係將佢。

696
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:46,550
做咗落地先抵，大家唔去睇嘅。好啦，但係我都唔同你去爭拗呢個事實，因為大家即係好明顯觀點係唔同。但係頭先有另一個邏輯咧，我一定要同即係房即係柏志高講清楚。佢就話咧，成個收三百蚊個邏輯咧，就係要去評估。

697
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:49,360
股是否係需要轉換？

698
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:54,490
即係佢意思就係用錢去評估是否需要轉換。

699
02:23:54,940 --> 02:24:05,030
咁即係話，你肯畀三百蚊咧，就等於需要；你唔肯畀三百蚊咧，就等於唔需要。咁呢個冇邏輯嘅呢樣嘢。

700
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:12,900
嚇！佢即係佢肯唔肯畀錢，只不係佢需唔需要個三百蚊，拖過去需唔需要去換？

701
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:20,760
咁然後你有另一個邏輯好大嘅問題咧，佢就豁免一啲係唔使畀三百蚊嘅。

702
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:28,700
嚇，咁即係話誒，佢豁免嗰啲人咧，就唔需要去諗佢需唔需要㗎啦。

703
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:31,130
係咪咁呢？

704
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:51,590
即係成個本身係唔合理嘅，你用錢去決定話到底個個即係轉換係需要定唔需要？依個完全唔合邏輯。即係我希望真係即係當然，佢而家講話啊，會攞翻去房委會嘅資助房屋小組委員會。

705
02:24:51,590 --> 02:25:11,600
去傾啦，但係即係我諗，我哋喺度好強烈咁希望咧，即係唔好你哋。我唔知你哋點寫文件，我希望你哋房委會、房屋處啊、政府嗰方寫文件畀資助房小組委員會，唔係淨係話立法會咧就通過動議，話要免費安裝，即係我相信都通過㗎啦，而係你哋自己。

706
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:31,610
都覺得唉係啦，其實即係你話誒，即係評估係咪需要轉換咧？其實唔使咁少加用錢去評估，其實根本啲人自己唔需要，佢都唔會話因為免費，所以我一定要你換㗎貪得意咩？你哋要入嚟搞佢。

707
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:41,950
嗰間屋，即係我大家對啲居民有啲信心啦，唔得，佢認為需要轉換嘅，佢就會自己會報名。噉我希望呢個係講清楚㗎。

708
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:45,300
時間夠啦，有有冇簡短回應？

709
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:53,850
我我 can assure members we will reflect accurately all the views expressed on this issue to the SHC members.

710
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:58,200
唔係，我唔係就係你想反映我哋意見。

711
02:25:58,490 --> 02:26:08,180
我希望你轉變政府自己嘅立場，嚇，即係即係你個基礎係有問題，即係唔合邏輯。希望政府唔好咁小家嘅嚇。

712
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:20,260
sorry, Mr. Chairman, our position is we're making a proposal based on the previous model. That's it. We haven't taken a view on this because it's for the HA to take a view. It's not for us to take a view.

713
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:25,350
接住係啊！

714
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:45,660
胡志偉副主席，啊，多主席，頭先啊李國榮副處長咧就講咗幾次咧，就係即係有好多人唔用咧，其實就因為佢自己室內咧本身有個室內嘅晾衣架，所以咧根本就唔需要，亦都唔會參與舊嘅計劃。誒，不過我想提一提，即係副處長咧，就係其實就算人唔

715
02:26:45,660 --> 02:27:05,670
用都好咧，呢啲嘅晾衣架咧，往往都成為插呢個，譬如話地拖棍啦，插呢一個嘅係誒誒，可能係掃把啊呢一類嘅用途嘅。咁其實你有冇諗過就係話，既然係噉樣樣嘅話，你都覺得嗰個位置係唔適合咧，係有啲外在嘅裝置咧插入嗰個，即係嗰三個位嘅上邊嘅時。

716
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:07,400
時間係咪？

717
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:27,690
你唔應該拆咗佢咧，噉樣呢個第一樣嘢。第二個就係話零四零五年度咧，你要係收二百蚊咧，就都係得五萬個單位咧係回應話會做啦。咁今次你再增加嗰個費用嘅時間，即係除非你個立心就係我都係唔想上啲人做嘅。咁如果唔係嘅話，你點樣樣係可以話？

718
02:27:27,690 --> 02:27:34,450
到畀公眾聽，就係你呢個新嘅計劃咧，或者呢個而家嘅安排咧，係會解決到你嘅問題咧？

719
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:39,300
咁第三個就係，即係你可唔可以畀個數字我哋講一講？

720
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:42,400
如果喺你個計劃裏邊，

721
02:27:43,150 --> 02:27:49,230
按照你可以豁免嘅基準，其實你剔除咗嘅單位有幾多個咧？

722
02:27:49,530 --> 02:28:01,450
你剔除嘅單位如果係好多嘅話，其實房委會係咪仲需要咧？係為即係剩翻落嚟嗰個剩餘嘅銀碼咧，係即係咁斤斤計較咧？

723
02:28:01,870 --> 02:28:18,890
咁所以我想聽下，即係呢幾部分嘅意見。咁到最後，當然我亦都希望就係即係誒，當你哋係假設係會安裝嗰個係晾衫架嘅時間咧，亦都係需要咧係考慮到嗰個適當嘅位置咧去做呢一件事。

724
02:28:19,170 --> 02:28:33,960
事實上咧，喺房屋處咁多年嚟咧，就住一啲嘅係大廈嘅設施咧，其實往往都係會做咗去就畀，如果你覺得有需要就會做。譬如我哋講緊誒冷氣機嘅係集水管。

725
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:38,960
以前冇嘅，你裝畀人哋，係咪啊？你都冇同人哋收費㗎。

726
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:56,680
咁誒電力嘅裝置，你覺得係需要係有個更換，你都係會做畀佢。呢啲都係建基於在業主嘅責任。點解突然之間，即係你覺得浪三假件，你都同意咗係有個責任要處理？起碼大部分啦，你都覺得係嘅時候，你唔會一視同仁咧，代主席。

727
02:28:57,210 --> 02:29:00,360
啊，處長啊，李生，多謝主席。

728
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:20,650
誒多謝阿阿阿阿副主席嘅提問。誒首先我逐點答啦，就嗰個誒三支香咧，我唔再重複啦。阿阿秘書長已經講咗咧，我哋自己嘅觀點咧，佢本身如果係用得恰當嘅話咧，本身嘅設計咧唔係一個問題，即係唔唔牽涉到一個一個錯誤。

729
02:29:20,650 --> 02:29:40,660
嘅設計，咁咁所以咧就正正係因為呢個原因咧，如果就算住户咧佢唔佢唔參加嗰個計劃，唔安嗰個架咧，我哋都唔會拆除嗰三支香。咁至於你話而家佢用嗰啲誒三嗰三個桶愛嚟做做第啲用途咧，噉我諗啊啊啊啊胡議員都好清楚咧，我哋有扣分制嘅，係呢個都。

730
02:29:40,660 --> 02:30:00,670
都係唔唔應該容許嘅，噉就不喺呢個題外話啦。噉就至於嗰個錢咧，誒先前二百蚊，其實誒都有五萬户咧係更換咗，咁其實時隔都係十年，我哋我哋咧亦都嗰個補貼咧係多過上次嘅一半，而家去到超過八成，噉我哋都會誒加。

731
02:30:00,670 --> 02:30:16,090
加強加強我哋嘅宣傳，同埋去解釋，同埋亦都有個問卷。噉我哋希望咧，儘量解釋翻咧。誒過咗一段咁長嘅時間，嗰個嘅誒誒情況咧，我哋希望咧，儘量誒如果有需要，居民有需要嘅話咧，我哋儘量會幫佢更換。

732
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:36,510
咁至於誒阿議員想問我哋誒闊面嗰個統計嘅數字有冇咧？我哋大約估計咧，即係如果係誒領取綜援户咧，係大約十二萬七啦。係係係誒係啊係啊，啊或者我調轉講長者全長者户咧，大約係十二萬七。依仲爭咁如果係攞緊。

733
02:30:36,510 --> 02:30:56,520
中環嘅嘅家庭咧係十五萬，咁但係當然當中又會會有重疊嘅兩者，咁所以咧亦都會有啲嘅家庭咧，呢啲嘅家庭未必住喺咁啱有三支香嗰啲嘅誒單位入邊，咁所以咧我哋綜合翻種種嘅因素咧，我哋粗略估計咧，大約可能係有十三萬户度咧。

734
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:12,620
咧係係合資格被豁免嘅，嚇十三萬十三萬合資格被豁免，會合資萬合資格被豁免嘅十三萬總共嚇，呢個係粗略嘅估計，大約即係百分之廿七度啦，嚇呢個百分之廿七度。

735
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:32,910
噉就誒，最後啊啊啊，議員就話咧，點解譬如嗰啲誒誒冷氣機去水喉啊，我哋又唔收錢啊，嗰啲誒重新拉嗰啲電線，我哋又唔收錢啊？我覺得嗰個同呢個有有唔同嘅地方。冷氣機去水本身我哋係冇嘅，咁而呢個咧係影響到滋擾到嗰個嘅衞生，咁所以咧我哋加。

736
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:47,570
嘅時候咧，咁呢個亦都係房委會願意負擔嗰個傳費。咁至於你話室內再重新拉個電線咧，嗰個我哋廿五年去到即係嗰個我哋差唔多覺得個嗰個嗰個危險性高啦，噉我哋係全面咁去取替嘅，都係主席。

737
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:54,850
逢檢機遇，誒！我諗處長面對我咧就冇嘢講㗎啦，我七十年代已經砌你三支香㗎啦。

738
02:31:55,130 --> 02:32:15,140
當年由徙置區就喺我公屋平愛蘇Call做，跟住八十年代公屋評議會咧就砌你誒愛民邨之後嗰啲嘅所謂公誒房屋房委會起嘅又係三支香，到到九十年代咧和諧式又係三支香。幾時你哋開始變咧？就係當二二千年代深水

739
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:30,890
水堡重建之後，嗰啲洗字區變成而家嘅壞式咧，就不能接受。街坊都唔理你死啊，就自己就響嗰個窗口出面整嗰啲咩T字桶。而家你就懶醒就話自己做啊，其實啲街坊自己做啊，逼到你就承認咗佢哋嗰種做法變成合法。

740
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:32,670
係全部爭翻嚟㗎！

741
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:49,400
如果你你既然覺得嗰啲係你自己合合法合理設計正嘅，改乜鬼啫？你睇你自己第四段點寫？為咗鼓勵街坊用呢個晾衫架代替咩？於是，我哋磅水畀佢，鼓乜勵啫？正嘅時候使乜鼓勵？就係唔正先鼓勵佢換啊嘛！

742
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:58,870
我從來未見過房屋署覺得啲正嘅嘢要要要放死畀人哋做㗎喎，呢個好明顯你自己問題㗎喎。但係你睇到到到最尾個建議嗰度成個B嗰段。

743
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:13,600
我哋應住户嘅需求，我先進行。你自己都矛盾啦，一方面係鼓勵人做，跟住應你需求我先做啦噉。你自己啲寫啲份文件，自己都自己打自己嘴巴。究竟你覺得住要啦，還是你自己要啦？鼓勵就你要嘅。

744
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:34,220
B嗰段咧就住户要嘅，嗱我就又覺得呢個咧係係係唔掂嘅設備嚟嘅。其實你九十年代先至，嗰就應該大個二千年代咧先開始正式叫做明顯地接受。就一方面就有得，但係街坊街坊喺廳外面搞嗰個T桶。第二個咧就係你零四零五你一隻磅水，呢兩個行為咧係一個好清楚係政。

745
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:37,120
府修定，誒話房屋署修定咗自己嘅做法。

746
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:51,140
對唔住主席，我覺得呢個係一個設計嘅問題，特別係你更換一啲自己業主自己提供嘅設備咧，係業主嘅責任，亦都係業主嘅權利。我就覺得係應該由頭到尾都係業主負責呢個業主嘅嘢嚟，同埋場外嘅嘢添，仲係。

747
02:33:51,490 --> 02:34:01,340
我覺得點會變成係住户嘅嘢？長室外嘅嘢都係大大業主發展商嘅事啦，係嘛？就算做咩，你講私人樓宇發團嘅事嚟㗎，點會租客負責咧？

748
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:09,580
不能接受啊！呢個呢個，從呢兩個角度都，主席，我覺得係由裝修到至到到維修，都應該係業係業主嘅。

749
02:34:10,210 --> 02:34:11,470
業主就係房委會。

750
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:31,920
請部門回應。Mr Chairman, of course, I'm at a huge disadvantage compared to the honourable member. I've only been dealing with this for about three or four years, and I don't honestly have that depth of historic knowledge. To be honest with you, all I can say is that I don't think it is contradictory to say that we believe that.

751
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:51,930
We should offer a programme and we should encourage people to join that programme. But as I say, I don't think you can force people. Our experience with these things is you cannot force people to take these things on. They they all have their own circumstances. And indeed, as we've tried to explain, the poll holders themselves are not usually the only

752
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:59,160
method for drying clothes that people have, and often they use the other alternate methods already, so they don't see this as an issue.

753
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:03,380
啊，逢檢嘅月，咪第二次。

754
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:05,640
誒，係嘛？

755
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:17,700
還是可以畀我補充問咧？如果唔使第二簡短簡短，我即係想補充問咧。其實佢而一個問題正在就係話，你係逼佢做曬佢咧，還是等佢自願、等佢認認同咧？我覺得技術上面點都冇所謂嘅。

756
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:37,990
如果你要街坊自己提出嘅，我哋咪動員啲街坊提出咯。咁到時真係有兩公兩三個、五六個佢唔提嘅咪佢嘅事咯。呢個我覺得冇所謂，反而最最緊要就係邊個畀錢邊個責任。我就覺得呢個係業主嘅責任。出面私人樓宇全部都係業主責任㗎，有乜邊係租客責任㗎呢個？你叫私人樓宇出面改外牆改啲嘢，係咪租客負責啊嗱？點解房屋？

757
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:39,920
署可以噉樣一聲話。

758
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:48,250
就又就要點就點，第二就係爭幾多錢爭嗰三百蚊。如果我按比例誒千五同千百爭嗰三百蚊，講緊七千萬領。

759
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:51,290
防委防委會完全畀得起啦！呢個數。

760
02:35:52,020 --> 02:36:12,030
我嘅始終就係呢個都係數都唔係係技術問題，我只不過係原則問題，就係係業主問題嘅業業主嘅責任。Sorry, Mr. Chairman, it's nine hundred million dollars. This is a large amount of money for any organisation. I have to have regard to that. I can't ignore the potential cost of this. That's one of the reasons why you have to look at a way to be able to identify.

761
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:17,370
identify who those people who need this sort of change. It is substantial money, Mr. Chairman.

762
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,920
誒。

763
02:36:19,450 --> 02:36:38,270
嗱，第一輪咧就最後係我噉，由於咧個法定時間咧已經係係接近咁咧，亦都因為咧我哋要有法定人數咧嚟去處理嗰個議案，咁所以因此我咧都將我嘅發言咧作為議員個人我濃縮。

764
02:36:38,580 --> 02:36:40,620
誒係幾點嘅啫？

765
02:36:41,270 --> 02:37:01,280
第一，我哋希望房屋署咧係鄭重聽取今日議員咧誒發表意見，即係大家嘅理據咧相當之充分。房屋署作為大業主，佢必須係承擔咧呢個責任。對於三支香嗰啲舊

766
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:13,850
嘅插銅式嘅呢個晾衣裝置咧，其實係非常之危險，應予取締，同埋係主動嚟去推動就住户咧嚟去更換。

767
02:37:14,130 --> 02:37:34,140
呢個係住嘅安全，亦都係個建築物安全嘅要求。呢個係個法例要求。因此咧，誒，我哋儘管我哋唔知道署方你點樣向房委會彙報，不過我作為主席咧，我就會要求秘書處將我哋今日。

768
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:40,270
討論嘅會議記錄原汁原味交畀呢個房屋委員會。

769
02:37:40,760 --> 02:38:00,770
等佢哋睇原汁原味，因為頭先大家嘅辯論咧係亦都質詢咧，亦都講得個責任好清楚㗎啦。咁為咗爭取時間去處理誒剛才誒嘅動議同埋休庭動議，我而家重新讀一次，然後讓大家表決好嘛？即係因為我哋。

770
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:20,780
唔可能有第二輪咧，因為確實唔夠時間啦。我動議嘅措辭係促請房屋署為參與以晾衣架取代插同式晾衣架裝置資助計劃的租户免費安裝及提供日後的維修保養。

771
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,210
贊成嘅請舉手。

772
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:29,450
誒去放低，有冇人反對？

773
02:38:29,730 --> 02:38:49,740
有冇人棄權？冇在席嘅議員一致贊成呢個誒動議同埋修訂動議。咁希望咧，房屋署咧，你盡快係將我哋嗰個建議咧係付諸實施，同埋盡快咧係幫住户嚟去呢個係完成嗰個改裝。

774
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:56,950
咁咧就最後一個議程，有冇其他事項？有冇？我哋嘅會議到此結束。多謝各位出席。
