00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,500
咁咧就誒，大家係咪同意傾呢兩個項目？

13
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:20,810
冇意見，我哋同意啦嚇。噉就而家進入議程第三，誒請部門嘅官員出誒到會場啦。

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,420
我哋等埋政府部門先。

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,720
誒歡迎咧，就係誒運輸及房屋局常任秘書長柏志高先生。

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,910
嗯。

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,060
副秘書長黃天宇女士，以及房屋署助理署長黎日正先生，誒。

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:11,660
我哋而家咧就係進入去咧係議程第三，就係房屋委員會對公共租住房屋非長者一人申請實施嘅配額及計分制。

19
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,380
立法會文件就係C.B.庫一九一九斜洞一二一三零二號文件。

20
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:33,730
呢份文件咧，就係政府當局就房屋委員會對公共租住房屋非長者一人申請者實施嘅配額及計分制提供嘅文件。

21
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,380
就歡迎咧係誒政府誒當局嘅代表出席。

22
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,480
咁咧就首先咧，我想請咧當局咧係誒作呢個電腦投影嘅影片介紹。

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:03:06,790
喺邊一位咧？喺秘書長。I'll say a few words. Just just to to set the scene, we are still at that discussion stage in the long-term housing strategy steering committee. So the papers that we're producing for members represent the similar papers that we're producing for the members for their consideration and discussion.

24
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:26,800
Obviously, what we're keen to hear is members' views on this, which will then be reflected back to the steering committee. Today, we have two papers. The first one is on the quota and point system. It's the current policy of the government and the housing authority to accord priority to general applicants, including family applicants and elderly applicants.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,860
Over non-elderly one-person applicants in the allocation of public rental housing units.

26
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:43,920
towards this end, the quota and points system was introduced to rationalise and reprioritise the allocation of public rental housing to non-elderly one-person applicants.

27
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:54,960
最近，The Long-Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee has reviewed the overall housing situation of the waiting list applicants， including those non-elderly one-person applicants。

28
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,580
Taking into consideration limited public rental housing resources.

29
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:12,210
the overall housing situation and the lengthening waiting list, the steering committee's made a few suggestions and recommendations on the enhancement, possible enhancements to the quota and points system.

30
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:21,150
The intention is that the public will be consulted on these proposals when the public consultation document on the long-term housing strategy is released.

31
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:35,540
和其後，The proposals will be referred to the housing authority for them to consider. and Let me stress, it is for the housing authority to take the final decision on any modification to the quota and point system.

32
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,230
as I said before, we're keen to ensure that members' views are also taken into account at this stage.

33
00:04:42,620 --> 00:05:00,170
I'd like to invite the principal assistant director, Anseli, to make a short PowerPoint presentation to brief members on the operation of the QPS as it is today, as well as the latest steering committee considerations and discussion on this matter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

34
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:13,380
阿黎生，多謝主席嘅。咁今日咧，我會好簡單咁講講即係配額及計分制嘅運作啦。咁同埋係長遠房屋策略嘅督導委員會就住呢個配額及計分制嘅一啲嘅重點嘅討論嘅。

35
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:34,070
咁首先就係關於誒配額及計分制嘅方面。咁其實呢個制度就喺二零零五年九月咧，就房屋委員會實施嘅。咁目標就係要理順啦，重定翻即係編配屋公屋畀非長者一人申請者嘅優先次序嘅。咁簡單嚟講咧，喺呢個制度之下咧，非長者一人申請者每年嘅配屋嘅限額咧，就係。

36
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:54,080
定咗喺編配係預備編配喺畀輪候拆申請者單位總數嘅百分之八，咁每年亦都係以二千個單位咧為上限嘅。咁呢個就係個配額嗰方面啦。咁得分嘅方面咧，申請者咧即係非長者一人申請者咧喺配額計分制下咧，佢攞到嘅分數咧其實三個決定性因素嘅。咁第一就係申請者。

37
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:08,010
佢哋喺遞交公屋申請時嘅年齡啦，第二就係佢哋係唔係公屋租户，咁第三就係申請者嘅輪候時間嘅。咁平均輪候時間約為三年嘅目標咧，係並不適用於呢一個佢配額及計分制下嘅非長者一人申請者。

38
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:24,320
咁有少少數字係等大家參考嘅。咁去到舊年誒年底咧，哥輪候冊上面一般申請者咧，大概有十一萬五千三百宗。咁而喺配合及計分制下面嘅非長者一人申請者咧，大概係有十萬零六千九百宗嘅。

39
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:37,440
咁呢個情況比起翻再上一年，即係二零一一年十二月底嘅情況比較咧，一般申請同埋配額計分制下嘅飛漲制嘅人申請嘅宗數咧，都分別噉樣係上升咗百分之二十同埋百分之三十四嘅。

40
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:57,130
咁亦都係有啲數字可以再畀大家參考咧。噉就係喺誒去年年底，大概係十萬零六千九百個配額及計分制下嘅飛將者一人申請者中咧，咁大概有百分之六十七，即係大概有七萬一千五百人咧，佢嘅年齡咧係三十歲誒三十五歲或者以下嘅。

41
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:17,420
噉我哋都參考翻，其實我哋每一年都會做一個嘅誒誒嗰個公屋樓層申請人嘅統計調查嘅。咁根據翻二零一二年嘅第一季嘅嘅結果咧，咁其實喺誒呢一批三十五歲或以下嘅申請者裏邊咧，誒擁有教育程度係有專上或者以上嘅咧，係大概百分之四十七啦。咁其實亦都有百分之三十四左右咧。

42
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:30,030
係誒申請嗰時係學生，咁亦都百分之三十三咗咧，佢哋係公屋居民嚟嘅。咁但係我哋都睇翻喺三十五歲以上嘅申請者裏邊咧，大概只有百分之七咧係有專上教育程度或者係以上嘅。

43
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:51,940
咁跟住，督導委員會亦都留意到之前我頭先介紹嘅資料啦。噉你都睇翻，即係呢段時間公屋資源係比較緊絕。咁睇翻我哋整體嘅新安置嘅情況啦。咁同埋輪候冊申請者數目咧都不斷增加。咁督導委員會咧亦都係重新咁確定咗，應該將呢個公屋單位優先編配畀包括家庭啊、長者啊。

44
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:06,100
申請維維助內嘅一般申請者呢個政策嘅，咁委員亦都認為咧，其實而家呢個制度即係包括係每年最多二千個公屋單位畀誒編配畀非長者人申請者呢一個配額咧，係應該要繼續維持嘅去。

45
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:26,250
不過咧，誒督導委員會亦都留意到咧，其實係喺非長者、隱身傾者裏邊咧，咁有一部分可能佢哋誒誒比較可能係缺乏呢個向上流動嘅能力啦，噉佢哋比較難咧係可以靠過透過自己咧係可以改善到居住環境嘅，噉佢哋認為咧呢一批人士可能係應該係優先咁獲配到公屋嘅。

46
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:46,740
噉佢嘅睇法係，雖然長遠嚟講咧，我哋應該係將個目標係誒，即係譬如誒將呢個平均銀行時間三年嘅指標咧，係拓展到去三十五歲或以上嘅非長者人申請者。咁亦都留意翻，因為而家現時公屋資源緊絕啦，咁而輪流出一般申請者，其實佢嘅數目亦都係有大幅咁上升嘅。咁所以咧誒。

47
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:56,430
委員就覺得應該係當將來公屋資源咧比較充裕嗰時咧，就要做檢檢視啦。咁幾時係可以將呢個誒指標咧係可以拓展到去三十五歲以上嘅申請者？

48
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:15,730
咁即使係咁都好咧，誒委員會亦都覺誒督導委員會亦都覺得咧，當房屋資源去向嗰時咧，應該咧係考慮咁分階段咧，將呢個目標咧係誒拓展到去一啲誒誒非長者人申請者度嘅，譬如話誒誒以五十五歲啊或者四十五歲為先啦，跟住循序漸進噉樣咧，希望係可以去到三十五歲嘅。

49
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:34,450
咁第一步咧，誒督導委員會亦都建議咧，係可以採採取啲即時嘅措施，咁去優化翻而家呢個配屋嘅計分制嘅。咁譬如話，畀翻三十五歲或以上嘅申請者，佢哋額外嘅分數啦，嚟增加佢哋喺配屋合計分制下面誒比較快噉樣咧，係可以獲到獲得誒編配公屋嘅機會嘅。

50
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:50,370
咁除咗年齡之外咧，督導委員會亦都覺得咧係或者可以值得考慮咧，係點樣可以將申請者嘅需要作為基礎，係作為一個定位編配誒佢哋公屋嘅資格準則嘅，咁令到我哋可以或者房委會係可以係考慮翻申請人嘅個別情況。

51
00:09:51,470 --> 00:10:11,480
咁督道委員委都認為咧，其實已經有一批係喺輪流策上面嘅配額計分制下嘅非仗者、人申請者咧，係可以譬如定期咁對檢視翻佢哋入息同埋資產嘅，咁令到一啲其實佢係雖然喺輪流策上面，但係已經其實佢哋入息啊或者資產已經超越咗我哋嗰個或者房委會嘅嘅限額嘅人士咧，係可以剔除，係。

52
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,210
離開呢個論壇上面嘅。

53
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:35,530
咁請，亦都係請今日我哋嘅誒誒嘅介紹咧，就請委員係誒留意備悉翻呢個配額計分制啦。咁同埋亦都係我剛剛介紹嘅，到委員會就住呢個呢方面嘅考誒討論嘅。咁正如頭先秘書長所講咧，咁誒從房屋策略嘅諮詢文件咧，係會就住公眾咧係誒邀請公眾咧係對譬如誒配額計分制啊呢～

54
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:55,540
啲建議改善建議嘅意見嘅，咁最終咧呢啲建議都會轉交畀房委會做考慮。咁誒，房委會係會作最終嘅決定嘅，就住配屋及計分制嘅任何嘅修改。噉我今日嘅介紹係咁多，唔該曬主席。誒，多謝阿黎生。就大家都誒聽到咧，就係今日我哋嘅討論咧，就誒部門又會帶翻。

55
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:06,190
翻翻畀佢防委會、督導委會咧嚟去進行考慮，所以咧我就會要求秘書就會將大家嘅發言咧係詳細記錄在案。

56
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:26,480
噉我亦都希望咧，係秘書長咧，如果能夠你即時係回應到嘅，你就誒回應啦。如果係誒交翻畀防衞會之後咧，我亦都希望透過你咧，係請防衞會就著立法會今日嘅討論咧，係作出回應。

57
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:39,760
即係委員嘅意見有邊啲，佢係同意邊一啲，佢係唔同意邊啲係同意又幾多，咁咧就都有個回應，就唔好誒令到我哋今日所討論嘅。

58
00:11:40,040 --> 00:12:00,050
其實提出嚟嘅意見咧，就係石沉大海，係冇回應嘅，好嘛嚇？咁誒，我睇到你哋岌頭啦，噉我希望你跟進嚇。咁咧，而家咧就係誒報咗名，準備發問或者係發表意見嘅委員咧，就係我講個次序：鍾樹根、梁志祥、胡志偉。

59
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:20,060
李李卓仁、郭偉強、麥美娟，誒連問連答，每一位四分鐘先啦嚇。請阿鍾樹根議員，阿主席啊，即係想講一啲唔對你不敬嘅説話，即係如果我哋依個小組叫長遠房屋策略小組咧，不如叫做頭痛醫頭、腳痛醫腳嘅小組。

60
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,740
我真係未見過噉樣去做策略啊，主席。

61
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:44,290
我仲要教中議員，我而家表達意見。誒，中議員，我先就著你咧批評本委員會嘅組成，我作出回應先。我作為主席，因為本委員會、本小組委員會嘅組成咧，就根據誒立法會，你等我講立法會。我揾畀間時間你，立法會房屋事務委。

62
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,590
會誒有委員提出建議，亦都經大家委員同意，係成立呢個。

63
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,480
立法會房屋事務委員會核下嘅長遠房屋策略小組。

64
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:17,770
正正我哋呢個小組咧，就係針對或者督促政府有關咧呢個長遠房屋策略嘅檢討咧，嚟發出意見嘅。咁所以咧，希望大家咧都係誒積極發表意見或者提出問題。至於能否係頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫到腳咧，我哋係。

65
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:37,780
盡我哋嘅努力去做嘢，不過我哋嘅小組就唔係去醫嘢嘅。而家請你繼續。唔係我表達表達意見啫，我有好多。我補翻時間畀你。你道歉不敬㗎啦嚇，不是對我不敬，因為我只不過主持會議啫。明白明白，你你唔使回應我啊，我即係誒。其實咧，作為一個做一個長遠策略又好，做一個政策又好。

66
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:57,790
咧係咪真係要自己揾啲專家要去做一啲研究咧？一人單位呢個問題牽涉個人口政策，你淨係話要聽市民意見，聽完翻嚟咧，你又搞到好複雜嘅計算方法。依個又加幾分，嗰個減幾分，依個又畀佢誒去排隊。

67
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,490
你知唔知道未來十年我哋嘅人口需求啲供屋嘅增長喺邊度咧？

68
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:23,780
連非長者嘅增長有幾多咧？長者有幾多咧？好似我哋呢批咧，都就嚟唔瓜柴嘅咧，都就嚟要攞單人公屋㗎咯喎。啲仔女唔會養我哋㗎嘛？呢個時候唔同我哋養老豆老母啊嘛，佢哋唔養我哋呢個baby boom啊，呢個墊後呢個嬰兒潮，全部都要。

69
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,340
退休啦，有幾多萬人啊？數以百萬計。

70
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:47,630
連嗰日我見到一個高官，我唔講佢名啦，做到咩處長、局秘書常任秘書長，佢都話：唉，第日我都係唔使住個幾千隻啦，我都走去丹拿山揾間七八尺，我都好滿足啦。連高官都係咁諗，我哋呢啲或者其他市民嗰啲，肯定咧將來咧嗰個老人啊，一二人嘅。

71
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:55,350
誒需要嘅一二人單位咧，係非常之多。你呢個一人政策咧，即係包括一二人啦，都係嗰啲單位嚟嘅啫。

72
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:15,700
你有冇諗㗎？你可唔可以真係揾啲錢？即係我希望我哋呢個會督促房委會揾啲錢去揾一啲學者去研究下，而家未來呢十年、二十年嗰個人口個變化推算，佢哋點樣嘅需求？我都話啦。

73
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:35,710
如果真係而家搞唔掂，有啲都唔係你嘅錯，可能前朝前一任嘅錯。而家你就算係劏房，點樣去工廠大廈做劏房又好，搞新式嘅林屋都好，你都要解決呢個問題，就唔係用一啲計算嘅方法，令到啲人壓後入到住公屋，入唔到公屋。

74
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:53,850
即係我我希望咧，即係房委會咧，要要諗呢樣嘢咯。我就由公屋長大嘅，我藍田十五座有條龍嘅，好巴閉嘅嗰陣時，嚇劉德華啲同屋主嚟嘅。我哋嗰陣時冇依啲噉嘅憂慮嘅，而家我就好憂慮啦。我老咗啊，我啲隔離左右啲朋朋友咧都唔知點樣去申請公屋。

75
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:14,170
即係你，你而家再話畀我聽話，喂，我哋聽多啲市民意見咧。等我哋有咩意見咧，我哋會翻去考慮考慮。喂，你主動啲去做研究去study下。你應該你作為政府，你哋收人哋咁多人工，就唔好畀人哋話減薪啦。喺大會裏邊拉布，希望你能夠話畀我哋聽，你有個乜嘢嘅。

76
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:34,180
嘅研究同有咩政策？多謝主席。誒，秘書長，你可唔可以簡短回應？簡短嚇。

77
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,740
and making sure that we take into account those issues, but you must understand.

78
00:16:40,210 --> 00:17:00,220
ongoing exercises to deal with immediate problems in housing. We're dealing with those on a daily basis through the housing authority, through the development bureau, the housing transport and housing bureau. This pot exercise is a long-term housing strategy. It's looking what do we need to do in ten years or fifteen years or twenty years to be able to satisfy those demands at that.

79
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,770
時間。

80
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:21,350
That's a different objective. We've got to do that as well as do the immediate exercise to deal with the immediate problems. So we are doing research. For example, we've commissioned research to look at subdivided units. We need to determine size, place, location, number, etc. That research, as I think members are aware.

81
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:35,780
We'll be briefing members on at the next meeting. That's already been commissioned. Other people of commissioning exercises to look at the population development, and we're taking that into account. The other issue that I think I want to pick up on is that.

82
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,190
ageing。

83
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,410
是。

84
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:51,150
One of the issues that this committee is looking at, what are the elderly housing requirements in the future? But we're also looking at things like young housing. What are the young housing requirements in future? What are the numbers going to be?

85
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
at the same time as this exercise, the long-term exercise is going on.

86
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:16,390
within the department and within the housing authority, we do an annual exercise to look at the demand for the next five year period for the delivery of those projects that we're working on now. and in that context, we look at the the flat mix, the size of flats, how many one p, two p, two bedroom, one bedroom flats we should

87
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:25,260
be delivering, anticipating the demand in five years' time, because that's the lead time that we build to. So every decision we make today

88
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:39,480
has a delivery in five or six years' time. So that this this is a matrix. It's not just one thing, and you can take it away from the overall picture. What we're talking about here is the long term, and that's why we're talking about these issues as a long term issue.

89
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:59,900
由於咧就剛才我講咗係補翻時間嘅，咁而咧大大補咗啦。咁以後發言嘅議員咧都希望留意咧連問連答四分鐘。請官員回應嘅時候，亦都留意下四分鐘我就截啦，因為時間所限。係跟住係梁志祥議員，多謝主席。噉就都。

90
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:19,910
幾同意啊！啊，鐘士根講關於嗰個房屋策量咧，其實真係要有整體研究，並並唔應該咧，即係不即係即係單獨去睇一件事。咁今日不過咧，就傾一個主題咧，就係非長者嘅一人誒輪候拆嘅情況。噉我覺得咧，就誒。

91
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:26,250
從即係處方畀我哋嘅資料顯示咧，其實有有啲好特別嘅意思喺度。第一個。

92
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:33,300
誒要喺申請緊係公屋嘅居民都三十三個百百百分之三十三，咁呢個數咧。

93
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:53,590
明顯睇到咧，其實住喺公屋嘅人咧，唔想同父母住，或者都希望咧自己獨立出嚟住。所但係佢又冇能力，唯有繼續住公屋嘅。咁呢種情況咧，即係話咧，誒顯示咗咧係咪你房屋政策，即係公屋房屋政策入邊嘅一啲所謂扶户政策啊，又誒嗰啲。

94
00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:13,600
誒其他嘅因素影響而導致咧，啲人咧係咪提早要跳出嚟咧？咁呢個我諗係一個一個考慮嘅因素啊！即係即係我諗啊，秘書長，你哋應該要研究下，即係咁多公屋居民住得咁安，即係有有安居樂業嘅地方，佢仍然要走翻出嚟係申請一人單位，噉啊足以證明咧。

95
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,600
就其中有啲政策係咪引導致啊？即係畀到個誘因，佢要走出嚟咧。

96
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
咁第二個咧就係誒。

97
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,320
而家嘅申請嘅人入邊有差唔多接近一半咧，係尊尊上程度嘅。

98
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:47,620
咁但係我剛才又睇到一個啊，誒介紹咧就話：喂，佢哋向上流動嘅能力低，噉啊睇嚟呢啲咧分分鐘佢排到隊咧都可能人工高咗都入唔到都唔定嘅。咁所以我覺得咧，呢個亦都更加引引起我哋嘅興趣，就話點解咁多尊上程度嘅人？

99
00:20:47,620 --> 00:21:07,630
咧佢會申請公屋，係咪真係我哋而家現今社會尊上程度嘅人士咧？佢嘅收入真係好低啊，低到啱啱係嗰個啊公屋入息嘅限額之下咧。咁呢一個咧顯示咗咧係咪另一個畸形嘅問題咧？咁噉我我覺得呢個值得即係啊。

100
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:27,640
頭先阿鐘樹根講個問題真係要研究嘅。好啦，我或者我我畀翻個時間誒，處方去答咧。誒，而家起緊公屋啊，即係頭先阿 Mister五年後你先可以誒做到一啲咧，即係真係可以配合到嘅工作。噉我想知道一下，喺單人單位五年，即係你未來嘅規劃入邊咧公？

101
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,930
公屋嘅單人單位，究竟你個比例係咪同而家一樣，定係咧按照而家個申請嘅？

102
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:54,220
差唔多接近一半人係單人嘅，噉你你會唔會將嗰個單人單位嘅數量咧係加大？就唔好似而家噉樣咧，雙家庭係最大，單人嘅係最少噉樣。唔該，李處長。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, let me deal with the the the issues in order. Um, in terms of the um

103
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:09,430
impact of policy existing policies such as the well-off tenant policy, I think it's it's not actually that easy to make a direct relationship. There are many many reasons why people apply. One of the reasons we know is that.

104
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:17,460
作為 part of the induction at some universities, students are told you may as well apply because there's nothing to lose by applying through the quota and point system.

105
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,650
That we know has had an impact on the number of people applying. It's a very odd.

106
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:36,420
thinking，because in reality，any student who's at a tertiary institution should expect to have an income well above that which would require them to be into public rental housing。所以那係一個問題，需要我們去睇。

107
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,170
In terms of

108
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:47,200
the social mobility being reduced. I don't believe that's true. I think it's it's just part of what they're told to do, so they do it.

109
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,400
I think social mobility is still there for those tertiary institutions students, and I don't think that that's related to the reason they're applying.

110
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:15,690
The second question really relates to the change in ratio, and the answer is yes. We do review that on an annual basis. We do look at it, but I must stress, the priority is given to family applicants and elderly applicants. Younger singleton applicants, we only have two thousand per annum within.

111
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,590
所以我們一直都有那數量的單個單位。

112
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,380
誒，胡志偉議員。

113
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,670
主席。

114
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:40,430
因為呢一個文件咧，就主要就我哋想提供啲意見，等長者傾嘅時間咧，有啲唔同嘅角度。我想提兩點，第一個咧就誒，即係署方成日都講啦，就係有關呢個非長者嘅一人申請嘅概況咧，即係嗰個就係。

115
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,570
考慮到佢長遠嚟講咧，都係即係比較上係。

116
00:23:44,860 --> 00:24:04,870
條件理想啲嘅噉，因此就係話咧，都唔應該咧係即係好吸引佢哋咧，係去進入嗰個嘅係即係單身輪候嘅即係房屋供應裏邊。噉我就只係想指出一點咧，就係即係個社會其實一路都變緊嘅，即係好多人而家係選擇緊做singleton嘅即係個人生活。

117
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:24,880
咁因此就係話，我會覺得，如果你要address，即係你要係要處理誒有關嘅呢啲小朋友、呢單身嘅申請者、非長者申請户咧，佢哋係可能會有個比較上急促啲變化嘅係入息嘅改變啊、資產嘅累積嘅話咧，其實你應該從就係縮短佢。

118
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:42,280
佢嗰個嘅，即係譬如正常嘅核心家庭，可能十年你先至再復檢佢。可能你對呢一啲嘅非長者户嘅係即係單身人士咧，你應該係早啲去復檢佢。咁呢個係即係我覺得喺個政策上係比較合理啲，而唔係透過計分制咧就咁將佢排除咗。

119
00:24:42,560 --> 00:25:01,350
第二個想問一個技術問題，就係即係喺呢份文件嘅最新情況嗰度寫咗咧，其實你喺上喺二零一二年嘅十二月底咧，有十一萬十一萬五千三百宗嘅係申請啦，咁當中咧一萬零六千九百個咧係呢一個非長者一人申請嘅。

120
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,720
誒。

121
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:14,150
當然咧，就咁睇數字嘅話，其實都幾得人驚啦。咁但係我想問下，你好話到畀我聽咧，就係呢一個申請嘅數目咧，都真係能夠攞到你單位嘅，即係譬如。

122
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:32,680
根據你嘅計分制之下攞到單位嘅數目又係幾多咧？係咪得個即係掌握到個數字？呢個第一個。第二個就係話有幾多嘅呢啲case咧，係真係輪到嗰個時候咧，仍然揈到你嗰個嘅係即係入資合入住公屋嘅資格咧噉樣樣。我唔知有冇啲基本資料提供翻。

123
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,140
第三個當然，我都要先先問一問，就係。

124
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:55,620
而家你成個嘅係房屋嘅供應咧，每年就一萬五千個啦。一萬五千個裏邊嘅組合，頭先啊梁志祥議員都有問過，其實組合係點樣樣嘅咧？你有冇係即係處理過有關相關嘅問題？因為如果就咁睇數字嘅話咧，其實你講緊每一年嘅核心家庭啊，或者係長者嘅單。

125
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:15,630
人士咧講九千九千個單位咧就處理到嘅，即係如果根據呢個表嘅話，咁噉我想問下就話，你哋有冇因應呢一啲嘅情況嘅改變嘅時間咧，係誒調整你嗰個嘅係房屋供應，咁令到就係話咧佢能夠比較有效去處理到而家輪候冊上邊咁龐大嘅輪候。

126
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:35,640
人口多啲，啊，李處長。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, to answer the last question, yes, as I say, we review the flat supply on an annual basis. We take into account the demand within each of the different eligible categories, and we we modify it. For example, last year we've we've slightly increased the the number of slightly larger flats because we know.

127
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:46,670
that the number of families, the large families, five, six, seven people families, have been tending to wait longer, so we've had to adjust the numbers. At the same time, as I said in in reply to the earlier question.

128
00:26:47,050 --> 00:27:07,060
For singleton applicants coming through the quota and point system, there's only two zero places every year, so that's that that number we have. I also need to clarify the supply is a mix of new fifteen zero new units plus the number of units that we can recycle from our existing stock, and that roughly estimates another seven.

129
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:19,190
7或8,000，所以總供應係around 22到23,000，and within that of course from the existing stock we have large and small flats，所以every year we have a huge mix of different sized flats。

130
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:34,350
On the other, the question of the review of income and asset limits, that's the ten-year review. It takes place for people who are already in public rental housing, people who are on the quota and point system.

131
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:54,640
list are not reviewed until they become eligible for allocation of a unit, and that depends on how long they're on the list.所以頭先我想問個問題，即係唔好意思，佢佢未答我就係即係誒，佢知唔知道？你試下第二輪得唔得？O K，好嘛，真係冇辦法，所以大家掌握下時間。我而家希望部門咧掌握下誒答問嘅時間。四

132
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,750
分鐘，因為好多人排隊啊，李卓仁議員。

133
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,810
李祥議員，係下一個誒，各位強議員。

134
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,180
都係主席。

135
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:24,710
剛才咧有議員咧就講呢個非長者單身一人嘅誒申請咧計分制咧係頭痛醫頭腳痛醫腳，但係其實咧以我所睇法咧，其實呢個計分制咧簡直就係闊佬懶理啊，根本就唔想醫乜都唔想醫。

136
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:44,720
因為睇咗條數啦，十萬非長者嘅一人申請噉啊，佢啊局處方咧就好有想法咧，就話呢個誒好多有接近七成嘅學誒申請人咧都係擁有誒學誒尊上程度嘅。咁但係問題就係處方你係咪單？

137
00:28:44,720 --> 00:29:04,730
擔保有學歷就有高收入咧。而家香港呢個環境根本收入同埋學歷唔可以直接掛鈎㗎啦。點解你仲喺度用啲似是而非嘅講法，令到呢班人咧要排除在外，而令到咧呢個公屋申請咧其實只係一個象徵式嘅申請，或者可以話係假輪候。

138
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:11,420
畀個假希望大家，根本就排唔到嘅，根本你就預設篩選，根本就將所有。

139
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,480
後生仔都篩選出去。

140
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:20,360
噉你叫呢班後生仔點樣對社會將來作出貢獻，或者對香港有期望咧？

141
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:33,310
頭幾年，如果佢住緊公屋，仲更加嚴重添。頭嗰十年都係負分嘅，如果你唔計每個月加一分嘅話，頭十年都係負分，即係話佢廿八歲先至可可以開始諗結婚。

142
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,000
你係亦都一個情況，就係推遲啲人嘅結婚年齡。

143
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:55,790
你嘅公屋政策係咪要達到噉嘅目的？同埋亦都睇到一個現象，就係你會有個強逼富户嘅問題啊！如果我住緊公屋，我結咗婚，真係有富户，你又唔畀我搬出，咩焗住我喺原有嘅單位，一個強逼富户出現。

144
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,980
噉佢有咩選擇咧？佢出邊定係捱貴租咧？佢本身收入可能。

145
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:08,150
加入咗庫户嗰個內容，但係其實佢去到私人市場咧，佢根本捱唔住，頂唔住啲貴租啊！

146
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,930
政府，如果你係有心嘅話，唔該你睇翻。你既然知道上一屆嘅，

147
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:35,370
嘅房屋政策係滯後咗，唔該，今屆追翻啦，唔好仲係闊老懶理慢吞吞啦。單身單身而家喺香港好普遍㗎，你唔可以話一定家庭優先。家庭優先之餘，都仲要單身人士嗰啲啲需求都要處理㗎嘛。你唔可以話我淨係解決有家庭咁單身人士嗰啲唔處理。香港而家。

148
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:41,210
單身嘅數字越嚟越多，只會上升就唔會有減。唔通呢啲單身人士唔需要住屋咩？

149
00:30:42,270 --> 00:31:02,280
完全講唔通咯。誒，部門回應咧。Thank you, Mr. Chan. I don't think that the the long-term housing strategy is is trying to ignore the housing needs. Indeed, the the reason that they focused on this particular issue is that they think that it needs to be addressed. They've come up with a series of of recommendations, including.

150
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:22,290
introducing progressively the three-year waiting time for for younger people, increasing looking at looking at exactly what their income level is to make sure that people are not on the list that shouldn't be on the list, and various other measures. But I agree with you one thing: it is not an easy thing to deal with because you've got to also

151
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,370
bear in mind that.

152
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:39,140
In addition to the quota and points system, we have 115,000 families waiting on the waiting list. They also have their needs. The other reality about young people is that their circumstances change really very rapidly. We know that a young person's

153
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,480
potential。

154
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:49,810
to advance themselves to get better income etc. is much much higher than the older single applicants. We we know from our our own research that.

155
00:31:50,090 --> 00:32:10,100
over 35， people who don't have tertiary education， they're not going to make much more out of their lives。 that's where we should be focusing our attention。 people at younger ages 20， 25， they have the potential， they should be looking to more than public housing。 and I think it's not unreasonable in a rational system of allocating limited resources

156
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,510
要給資源，

157
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,490
誒，李卓仁議員。

158
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,830
誒，主席就即係我覺得好奇怪一樣嘢，依個長屋。

159
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:29,320
誒，長遠房屋拆督拆落小組委員會，即係有個督導委員會咧。咁點解個督導委員會督完之後都冇嘢，冇我冇睇到有任何嘢督到出嚟？

160
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:49,660
係啊，李源佢啊喺開頭介紹嘅時候，你唔喺在座咧，佢哋而家未結論，佢哋正。唔係啊，但係唔係啊，佢佢當然我聽到。佢話呢份文件咧，係啊，但係佢有考慮因素啊嘛嚇，你可以提出嚟啦。係啊，問題點解佢喺度寫考慮因素？我都聽到，我都覺得奇怪，好似未傾完啦。但係佢喺度考慮因素，第一。

161
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:57,770
你睇第五章嗰個誒誒，即係個個誒PowerPoint委員認為咧，都係維持二千個。

162
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,850
應維持不變，咁有個結論啦。

163
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:13,540
咁又話聽，又話佢仲未研究完，咁點解有個結論話維持二千個咧？咁然後跟住咧就係話啊，即係三十五歲以上咧就有得諗下，三十五歲以下就冇得諗。

164
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:33,830
噉佢又好清楚，好似有個結論喺度。噉我覺得即係成件事本身，你係咪當三五歲以下啲人就冇房屋需要咧？係咪依個長屋長屋誒長遠房屋策劃小組委員會個督導委員會本身就係覺得三五歲以下啲人係透明嘅咧？其實三五歲以下一樣有房屋需要啫嘛。嗱，當然你有個分析。

165
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:40,680
就話三五歲以下啲人，有啲係有大專，啊有啲係住緊公屋，咁無論點。

166
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,070
嚇！你唔應該因為佢個年齡而覺得佢冇房屋需要。

167
00:33:45,350 --> 00:34:05,360
嚇！我而家覺得成件事最大問題咧，就係當年青人係冇房需要嚇，有好多係冇得住公屋咁點啊？佢冇得同父母同住公屋嘅喎，佢自己係喺出邊啊捱緊板眼房嘅喎，咁嗰啲點啊？咁嗰啲你唔當佢係有房需要，咁所以我覺得有誒第一個問題就係點解你個督導委？

168
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:25,370
會本身係根本係嗰啲，即係根本原地踏步，二千個嚇，然後跟住就亦都唔理卅五歲以下，咁乜嘢都冇改過，噉你你搞咩啫？咁而家已經即係成咁多年青人喺度等緊上樓嚇，希望可以有個瓦遮頭咁簡單。

169
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:37,220
嘅要求，你唔可以講個個人都係冇問題嘅，冇需要㗎。咁所以我覺得唔應該歧視年輕人，唔應該歧視三五歲以下嘅人。噉我想聽下即係啊，秘書長嘅回應。秘書長。

170
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:57,990
Mr. Chairman, I really don't think the steering committee takes the view that people under 25, under 35, under 45 don't have housing needs. The mere fact that they're applying through the quota and point system already indicates they have housing needs. The issue, unfortunately, is that there are limited housing resources, and in a limited housing

171
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:11,300
housing resource situation， you have to somehow prioritise the allocation of units in accordance with something that is transparent and fair， so everybody knows exactly where they stand。 in order to do that， you have to come up with a system。

172
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:19,650
The system that's been devised and has been in place for you know over seven years now, has been that we give priority first to.

173
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,810
The elderly, second to

174
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:43,100
family groups and third to singletons. Within the singletons, again there's another hierarchy. Older singletons have the priority over younger singletons. That does not mean to say that anyone in the government or in the steering committee considers that these people do not have housing needs. So that's one thing we must be absolutely clear about.

175
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:58,520
recognise there is need. What we need to do, and this is already part of the objective, is increase the overall supply of housing so that we have more to be able to accommodate more people on the waiting list. Because the objective must be to reduce the waiting list as a whole.

176
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:19,170
not whether it's a family or an individual, you want to reduce all of the waiting list, and the only way you can do that is by increasing the number.唔係，但係主席，你如果淨係維持二千個供應，咁點樣可以減少嗰個單身人士嗰個喺個輪候冊嗰度冇啊？你二千個你都冇改到，你除非你話增加二千嗰個啫，噉我都覺得你一定。

177
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:29,010
答呢個問題喎，嚇噉你始終咧歧視三十五歲以下喎。李主張你答一答呢個問題，你嗰個二千個，既然係諮詢意見，點解會又好似係結論性意見咧？

178
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,900
very very simple.

179
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:52,190
As the number of units that are available through the supply increases, then you can review the proportion that's given to each category. But at the moment, as members are well aware, the fifteen thousand is all we're able to produce for the next four or five years. Once that number goes up to twenty thousand or more than twenty thousand, plus the HOS coming in, then you

180
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,200
look at that again, but their conclusion is in the current state that seems the the reasonable number.

181
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,050
係長遠到佢哋都老曬啦。

182
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,750
係孟美娟員。

183
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:13,140
主席，其實我覺得啊，處長啦、秘書長啦，你啊真係誒，對於而家我哋講緊嘅問題咧，你應該負最大嘅責任。誒，我哋講緊。

184
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:33,430
點解我哋香港今時今日仍然係冇屋？你自己話我哋有limited housing resources，點解會搞到咁咧？就因為喺你做咗秘書長咁耐，你從來都冇睇到呢個問題。我哋講緊單身非長者嘅單身人士一人單位嘅申請咧，已經唔係即係今日先講㗎啦。點解喺你做？

185
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:53,440
秘書長嘅咁多年以嚟都冇正式去做咧，噉係咪真係要等到呢個steering committee嘅時候，你先至話要去令到？因為你話你覺得萬五個噉，所以你只可以攞二千個出嚟。而家其實你就令到我哋咧有一個兩難。第一咧，我哋知道喺個公屋輪候冊裏邊咧，有一啲三十五歲。

186
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:13,450
以上嘅一啲申請者，佢哋真係急需要公屋，但係又有一啲而家嘅非長者嘅單身人士咧，又係需要公屋。若果我哋而家同你傾呢一個噉嘅計分制咧，其實我哋亦都咧令到我我都好難好難為，有一班人佢哋係又要，另外一班非長者嘅一人申請者。

187
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,220
佢哋又要噉，你嗌我點咧？我要犧牲邊一邊啲人咧？

188
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:34,830
所以其實而家之前嗰個公屋建屋量咁低，到到今時今日，而家特首話要加快個建屋工程，你都只係可以快得幾個月咧。喺你嘅領導之下，英明領導之下，你成日局咧，你個你嘅處咧都做得咁慢咧。我諗你真係絕對有好大嘅責任。

189
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:49,540
第二樣嘢咧就係頭先好多同事都講，究竟而家個二千個，即係你頭先就話啦，可以第二日有新嘅起屋起到新嘅嘅新嘅公屋嘅時候，我哋先至可以即係review嗰個檢討嗰個數量。

190
00:38:49,820 --> 00:39:09,830
但係，我想問，究竟喺你而家做呢個規劃嘅時候，希望你唔好再重蹈你以前嘅重刀覆切啦，唔好再犯翻你以前嘅錯誤。你可唔可以話畀我哋聽？你而家話要長遠解決，你有冇一個時間表？你有冇一個目標？幾時可以幫呢一班嘅非長者嘅單身一人？誒？

191
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:20,160
單身人士去申請呢個公屋嘅時候，佢哋幾時可以將條隊去減去縮短咧？幾時可以令到佢哋快快到幾時可以申請到呢個公屋咧？李處長。

192
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:29,930
Mr. Chairman, the dilemma I face as the permanent secretary and director of housing is I don't control the land supply.

193
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:42,480
我可以 build every site I'm given and I'm taking sites that frankly ten years ago, five years ago we wouldn't have taken, but I'm I have to respond with the land that I'm given.

194
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:57,060
那係現實，我面對。如果我可以得更多土地，我就可以建更多。我有資源去做到。現在，例如在兩年內，我們會建20,000個單位，一年。所以我可以達成數字，如果我有土地。那係第一。

195
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,230
Reality, I have to face.

196
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,080
In terms of the the dilemma, I think you're absolutely right. It is a dilemma facing the community.

197
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:13,880
as to how we allocate the resources that we have, I can't create out of nothing additional housing. It takes time.

198
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:29,010
The government has committed to increase the total land supply for housing to 20,000 per annum for public rental housing, plus an additional 5,000 on top of that for home ownership scheme, plus.

199
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:43,100
20,000 equivalent in the private sector. Once those sort of numbers start to kick in, then there will be much more choice available to the community for the allocation of units, and that's when I think we'll be looking at.

200
00:40:43,380 --> 00:41:03,390
significant decrease in the number of people on the waiting list. But until we do that, we're stuck with the reality because it takes five years from getting a piece of land ready for development to completing that development. We've reduced it as much as we possibly can. I don't want to take up your time, but the many devices that we've used to reduce that time, but

201
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,790
still takes five years.

202
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,240
黃毓民議員。

203
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:24,200
嗱，其實個關鍵問題大家都知道喺邊度嘅啦，係咪？不過即係誒，你而家話要起多啲公屋，咁先可以解決個根本問題，咁呢個就已經係阿媽係女人嚟嘅啦，呢個常識嚟嘅。

204
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,450
個問題唔喺我哋問問題嘅人身上，而喺你哋身上啊嘛！

205
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,620
你喺個決策嘅當局，係咪啊？

206
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,210
你個局長係嘛？

207
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,040
佢又好熟悉防火問題，做防火委員會委員咁多年。

208
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,240
個特首。

209
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,000
又英明都不得了啦！講房屋政策。

210
00:41:45,290 --> 00:42:04,450
係嘛？你老人家有一個技術官僚清楚得不得了，係嘛？個站喺你哋嗰度㗎嘛，係嘛？即係而家我哋嚟講呢啲問題，其實都好嘥時間嘅講嚟講。嗱，我唔會反對而家個督導委員會即係嗰啲建議，係嘛？都係解決問題嘅一種方法。但係你歸根究底都係個房屋供應問題。

211
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:25,050
即使你而家話惡，好似佢嘅建議，大家睇下第八段。佢話輪候差一般申請者平均嘅輪候時間係三年左右，噉就可以延伸到配額同埋計分制，三十五歲以上嘅非長者一人申請者係嘛？喺公屋資源較為充裕嘅時候，分階段實施，譬如同。

212
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:45,060
以四啊五歲同五啊五歲做起點，噉啊循序漸進又揀翻落去三啊五歲，咁喺呢個文件第八段噉樣講。喂，嗱呢個我我哋同意嘅喎，係嘛？喺現行呢個制度底下，你做一啲改善咁解啫，係咪？咁但係問題你都解決唔到嘅，都係得個噏字嘅啫。你冇屋啊嘛，係咪？冇屋，你呢個做法？

213
00:42:45,060 --> 00:43:05,070
咪始終都係唔得咯。三十五歲以上嘅非長者一人申請，誒嘅住屋需要，我其實唔會比一般嗰個申請者低㗎嘛。甚至乎有可能因為佢哋缺乏嗰個置業嘅能力，或者甚至乎即係因為個居所比較遠，好多種其。

214
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:13,160
而家你又令到佢繼續單身㗎嘛？於是呢個係一個惡性循環嚟㗎嘛？呢個惡性循環個根源，你又唔夠屋啊嘛？

215
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:24,120
係咪？即係你而家呢個做法，或者包括呢個督導委員會嘅建議，我都覺得係可以接受，又可以實行，但係問題就係。

216
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:44,420
個關鍵仲係冇唔夠屋啊嘛，所以我哋討論啲問題嘅時候，唔能夠單係睇表面或者問題個本身，你頭痛依頭腳痛依腳，然後治標不治本係嘛？而家你講緊呢個叫長遠嘅策略係嘛？你有幾長遠啫？而家擺在眼前嘅問題，你就已經解決唔到啦。

217
00:43:44,460 --> 00:44:04,470
係嘛？而家開呢啲會，你攞嚟講係嘛？咁即係話，就算督導委員會，佢都係期望喺公屋資源較為充裕嘅時候，分階段實施建議喎。係公屋供應比較充裕嘅時候，再分階段實施喎。噉你話我哋而家喺度討論呢個問題，咪即係等我等係即係攞廢鴨？

218
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:24,480
係咪？基本上就係，即使好似第九段嗰個建議，我都唔反對嘅喎。係咪？即係已經喺輪候策上嘅配額同埋計分制之下嘅非長者一人申請者，可以定期檢視佢入息同埋資產冇求喺輪候策上剔除嗰啲不合資格嘅申請者，尤其是係登記時係學生畢業嘅時候收入咧。

219
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,400
係超越咗呢個輪候測時入息限額嘅申請者。

220
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,240
我都覺得呢個咧，即係可以勉強可以接受啦。

221
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:52,530
但實際上都唔得嘅喎，嚴格嚟講咧都係好不人道嘅啫。講就講嘅係嘛，當然佢愛入息增加咗啦。咁但係佢申請嗰陣時未唔係啊嘛，係咪咁呢個都係有啲人可以入同你拗嘅，都O K啦。咁有咩用咧？係咪即係你一個公平公正嘅原則就係話，如果你要定期檢視，即係你係要適用喺所有。

222
00:44:52,530 --> 00:45:03,870
有嘅申請者，第一，第二要重新審視有關入息同埋資產審查嘅標準咧，就要確保呢啲有關嘅標準喺目前呢個社會裏邊咧係合情合理嘅。嗱，呢啲係我意見，唔使你答。講完。

223
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,740
好，誒。

224
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:19,820
一如我開頭講咧，你哋如果發表嘅意見，我哋都係會全部詳細係透過秘書長咧轉交畀呢個係督導委員會，希望我日後要回應嘅。誒，梁業忠議員。

225
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:33,310
誒，多謝主席。主席，我手頭上咧有幾位嘅六啊幾歲以上嘅誒長單身長者咧，佢輪候緊咧已經超過兩年幾以上，接近三年嘅時間，都仍然能夠獲得編配咗單位。

226
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:53,600
即係何況咧？有啲咧就即係喺三零歲或者廿零歲嗰啲嘅即係單身人士咧，我諗更加係即係唔可以講話有幾時。事實上咧，啊，報紙長你都講咧，嗰啲就更加年紀輕嗰啲咧，更加遙無期啦噉樣。咁但係問題在於就係，即係你連長者都解決唔到時，我真係幾幾難期望得到你連嗰啲。

227
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:13,610
啲即係後生啲，你解決得到咁？呢個呢個問題裏邊咧，今日你要我哋喺度講同唔同意多道委員會考慮嘅因素咧，我就覺得我一定唔同意。因為點解咧？佢講到好清楚話咧，佢每年咧嗱，佢委員會亦認認為配額同埋計分制咧，不過每年最多係最多啫，都唔會超過二千個單位。

228
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,920
噉你點去解決嗰問題咧？

229
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:36,340
當然，大家都頭先好多同事都講咗啦嚇，即係依個嘅餅裏邊咧係咁大嘅啦。噉你叫想做咗點樣樣？如果增加二千以上嘅，咁其他咪少咗咯噉樣。咁但係不過問題在於就係今日咧，即係我好認同啊麥美娟議員所講嘅，就係呢個問題唔係今日嘅問題嚟嘅。我哋依係幾年之前，即係唔冇冇話十年八年咁長嘅時間嘅話咧。

230
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:44,830
咦？你講咗係唔夠房屋，但係當年你同阿鄭裕華兩個不斷都話得啦夠啦，萬個咧執單位係足夠嘅。

231
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,500
保持咗三年上樓添，仲話。

232
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,120
即係呢個係當時你講嘅。

233
00:46:50,400 --> 00:47:10,410
好啦，頭先啊啊，秘書長你講啦，回答唔咪秘書員講話咧，即係唔關我事啊嚇。地政唔畀地，我哋點辦啫？唔係先得嚇。但係噉樣樣喎，我唔知點解遲啲咧又可以超過萬五個喎，又話二萬個喎。咁點解遲啲有地咧？點解以前係冇地，一將來有地咧？啲好矛盾喎，一樣嘢嚟講係我。

234
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:30,420
我都唔知點解一時又有地，一時冇地，一時起多啲，一時起唔到咁多啲。咁究竟你哋究竟係可以起多啲，唔可以起多啲咧？噉係咩時候可以起多啲，咩時候唔可以起多啲咧？你唔噉樣講嘅話咧，我根本無從同你討論呢個話題。即係點解咧？係咪煮限飯？你永遠都係得咁少啦，萬五個啦。噉你點樣樣咧？係嘛？咁咧？

235
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:50,430
就誒，況且你哋咧好有偏見咧，同埋想係醜化啲人咧。你睇啲啲啲表就知道㗎啦。你只係將單身人上面咧大專程度以上咧就四啊七個percent誒，申請視為學生三啊四個percent，公屋居民三啊三個percent。咁其他你唔講嘅，其他即係有困難啲你唔講，想係醜化啲人。

236
00:47:50,430 --> 00:48:10,440
其實呢啲人啦，有咩背景嘅話咧，我唔我係十幾期九啦嚇，十幾期六啊，十幾期五啊，佢到到真係派畀佢時候咧都唔使愛嘅，係冇得愛咁點解咧？可能佢個資產已經過曬過曬額啦。噉你寫出嚟冇意思啊！畀人講句，而家你調翻轉頭寫啲有需要嗰啲人係點解？

237
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,210
嗰啲人㗎嘛係咪先啦？你根本有偏見，所以社會上嗰啲人想幫你一把，想鬧呢啲人。

238
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:36,620
但係有啲人咧，年青人咧，佢真係好需要嘅，住一板間房，自己讀讀誒，即係讀自己自自食其力嗰啲點解決佢咧？你又唔去諗一諗喎？所以咧，就主席，我反而覺得咧，多度委員會咧，你唔好淨係喺公屋資源裏面諗問題、解決問題。喺今日嚟講係應該喺公屋資源以外，係點樣協助呢一班？

239
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:51,640
嘅單身人士先最重要嘅，無論係長者好或者年青人都好，即係佢個經濟上高而需要公屋嘅話咧，你都幫佢諗一諗。即係我想問下問下秘書長咯，就係你哋只係諗喺公屋裏邊嘅範疇，而喺公屋以外嘅嘢仲諗唔諗咧？

240
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,890
簡短，公屋以外，可唔可以諗？

241
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:15,410
啊，邊度？Mr Chairman, yes. First, the the Long Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee isn't looking at this with a view to the constraints on the housing supply. We haven't asked them to do that, and in fact, we've said to them, look at it for what you think is the best way to look at the supply for the future, because in ten years or fifteen or twenty years.

242
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,180
which is a long-term.

243
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:23,670
咁秘書長好慘喎，你就講咗係一定係二千個，將來都係二千個啫喎，冇得變嘅喎。

244
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:39,570
那係嘅，但係我覺得，如果我哋嘅經濟係噉樣嘅話，我哋嘅經濟係會唔會係一個好緊張嘅經濟？

245
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:59,970
就誒，我睇到嗰個公屋嗰個需求數字咧，近年咧就上升得好快啊！咁尤其是有啲非誒長者單身啊，咁其實而家今日講嘅，我我我覺得就係啲短期咧，因為你嗰個公屋嘅而家單位資源就係唔夠，噉就唔係長期嘅，呢個係短期，你用啲計計。

246
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:19,980
計分制度去誒，即係去去去編排啦噉樣。噉我想問一問咧，即係純粹係計分制度啫，因為今日都唔係長遠㗎啦啲計分制度咧，即係有冇我唔知啊？有冇反映到譬如你頭先講咧一個分數咧，隨個年紀啦，即係一路大啲咧會多啲㗎啦。噉啊，當然大大下咧接近做長。

247
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:39,990
者嗰陣時咧嚇，假設啦，咁其實同長者方面嗰個係咪誒嗰個輪候方面咧就反映到嘅，即係因為佢可能過多兩三年啲長者啦，等到噉樣呢個第一點。咁第二點咧，即係頭先亦都有誒同事提過咧，就話關於即係咁單身啫，咁但係咁上下咧，即係佢想結婚，但係佢想。

248
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,230
結婚咧，佢就當單身。

249
00:50:42,510 --> 00:51:02,520
誒同嗰啲有家庭嗰啲咧，點樣反映翻咧？係咪有某個程度咧，即係佢需要結婚啦，咁即係佢需要一個單位啦，噉樣。咁呢度有冇即係喺個計分度咧有反映咧？第三樣嘢咧，我想就係問一問啦。咁而家唔知有冇數字咧，十八歲至廿五歲嗰啲青年人申請咧係有幾多咧？噉。

250
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:22,530
因為呢啲好多時候咧就讀緊書，可能係讀緊專上誒學院都唔出奇。咁有冇個數字咧？啲人畢業之後咧，究竟佢嗰個收入咧係咪即係話誒個比例上有幾多咧？即係馬上咧跳出嗰個嗰個誒合資格嗰個嗰個誒嗰個範圍裏邊咧個收入噉。

251
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,240
嚇！

252
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:43,930
唔該，被主席。Mr Chairman, let me try and do this. The easy one: if if someone's on the QPS and they get married, then of course they move on to the family application list, and their period on the QPS also counts to a certain extent towards their waiting time on the waiting list for the.

253
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:50,690
Generating list, so there is a different status, and we consider them in that relevant context. So that's the first one.

254
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,530
In terms of the

255
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,510
The.

256
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:04,940
the figures of cohorts from 18 to 25. The figures we have relate up to 18 to 30, I think it is, not to 25. And perhaps Agnes can give you those figures.

257
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,820
上嗰個信息。

258
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,460
三十歲以下嘅就係佔咗成五十四個percent嘅，即係有五萬七千六百個。

259
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:38,380
即係喺喺總共嗰個十萬零六千九百個申請裏面咧，就係有一五十四個percent，五萬七千六百個係三十歲以下嘅申請者。主席，其實誒，我其實最主要咧，因為點解咧？好多時候咧，而家發覺有個趨勢，啲學生咧就申請啊嘛。咁啲學生申請咧，當然佢變化大嘅先畀。

260
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:58,390
署長講過，噉你點解啲數字都唔做下咧？即係其實你三十歲可能已經做緊嘢一段時間，咁點解冇啲誒十八廿五歲啊嗰啲通常都即係咁？另外咧，頭先誒秘書長都講咗一個問題，其實結婚你當然係啦，你就變咗即係結咗婚就變咗係家庭啦。即係想結婚，即係你依個有雞同埋雞。

261
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:03,100
雞蛋嘅問題，即係個先有同事都提過嚇，嗰個點樣反應咧嚇？

262
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:23,390
啊，Peter John，yeah, it is it is to a certain extent a chicken and egg. But their family status changes, so therefore their eligibility changes, and of course they then apply. The three year waiting list applies to them. In terms of research as to what the income is from eighteen to twenty five or eighteen to thirty.

263
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:43,400
Actually, that's one of the things that we would be looking at if we were to apply the suggestion from the steering committee that we do a review of these younger people's income. And let me stress, because I think someone quite rightly made the point that if we do a review of income, it should be across the board and not just targeting one group. So I think.

264
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,670
Our approach would be to look at all of the QPS people, not just one particular segment. I think that's important.

265
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,260
國家奇緣。

266
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,800
朱靜。

267
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,470
即係呢份文件係相當令人哋係憤怒同埋沮喪，因為事實上同一批嘅官員就係。

268
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:05,370
年紀之前都係講緊咧，我哋冇呢個誒公屋一個短缺嘅問題。

269
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:15,950
大家如果我做一個簡單嘅數，我哋睇到咧就三十五歲以上嘅咧就佔你哋嗰個大概百分之三十三，換轉嘅數字大概三萬五千二百幾。

270
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:29,460
如果用二每年二千個咧，即係我係估計十八、十七八年啊，就算冇人再加年紀咧，先至可以攞到。即係話，就算佢唔係長者咧，佢等得到嚟嘅話，一定係變咗長者嘅啦。

271
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:33,960
即係啲嘢相當於係離譜嘅，因為事實上咧。

272
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:41,960
三十五歲以上或者四十五歲以上嗰啲，佢哋嘅住屋需要咧，其實政府係主動正面咧。

273
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,370
係歧視咗佢哋。

274
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:59,830
因為住嗰個需要唔會因為個年紀而改變嘅。如果佢係任何一個時候，佢係負責唔到或者冇能力係負擔香港昂貴同埋方天即係啲相當荒謬嘅樓價嘅話，佢一定係需要一個公共資助房屋嘅。

275
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:04,330
而家呢個政策咧，係將呢一啲人嚟正面正面去歧視。

276
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:19,070
噉你嗰啲噉嘅全部咧啲數字都好多都係畀份文件我哋都係糖水滾糖漿嘅啫，因為事實上地喺你手上喺政府嗰度，咁如果你扯貓尾嘅你唔畀地，你永永遠起唔到。我問題就問第一。

277
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:27,690
而家喺四十五歲或者五十五歲以上嘅長者，根據你哋呢一個計法，要等幾多年先至攞到？

278
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,020
第二。

279
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:45,200
呢一啲嘅單身嘅單位咧，其實喺規劃上佢需要嘅土地嘅面積咧係少啲嘅。換言之，同一個土地，如果佢係起單身嘅公屋嘅話咧，佢係可以放多啲人入去住嘅。政府好唔好畀一個老實嘅數字？

280
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:56,400
如果你畀譬如百分之十嘅土地，或者百分之十五嘅土地，係咪可以將呢個單身嘅輪候嘅唔公平嘅情況咧，係得以改變？

281
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:16,810
第三咧就係喺而家嘅計劃入邊咧，其實啲單身嘅宿舍誒，單身嘅公屋咧，佢需要嘅地盤面積可能係細一啲嘅房署。我聽講好多啲樓咧，或者一啲譬如一啲唔唔係適用嘅，譬如啲小學或者中學嘅校舍咧，而家等緊嚟改建嘅，即係房房屋。

282
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:29,990
屋邨入邊嗰啲，你哋有冇一啲計劃短期係增加呢一啲我哋叫單棟嘅單身嘅誒公公屋去解決呢一個問題？係啊，部門長回應啊。Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um.

283
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:50,910
If it was a simple matter of just building more small units and I could ignore the family applicants and the other applicants, then it would be an easy solution. But I can't. I have to look after all of the applicants on the waiting list, particularly because the the general waiting list applicants, we have a commitment.

284
00:56:50,910 --> 00:57:03,330
of trying to get them a first offer within three years. We do not have that commitment currently.主席，唔好意思，你係將呢一班人，你冇係應承三年，呢個先至係最大嘅問題。That's right, we haven't.

285
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:23,710
那係正面嘅歧視嚟嘅，唔好喺度對話啦，佢而家答應你係。You know, as I said, this is one of the issues that the long-term housing strategy steering committee has been recommending. They're saying we should progressively introduce the three-year.

286
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:43,720
waiting list also for people on the QPS list. That's what their recommendation is, and that's something we will refer to the housing authority. But at present time, the policy does not provide for a fixed time for those people on the list. So therefore, I actually can't give you the figures that you asked for as to how long someone will wait on the QPS list. We don't.

287
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,280
record that information.

288
00:57:45,560 --> 00:58:05,570
and the other reason we can't provide that information is that as people come on to the list other ages, if they come in above say forty five or fifty five, people below get forced down and have to wait longer. So it's a constantly moving situation on the QPS list. 主席，我想攞翻佢一啲書面畀翻咧，就係譬如譬如就係四十五。

289
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:22,310
五歲、五十五歲以上嗰個輪候嘅時間。誒，咁同埋佢喺呢一個佢平均嘅等咗嘅時間，書面畀翻我哋。好啊，部門你補充翻啲資料。As I say, Mr. Chairman, on the QPS waiting list, we don't have that information, I'm afraid。你年幾多歲以上都冇啊，主席？會。

290
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:38,390
We have the age profile, but we don't have the waiting time。唔係噉，你畀畀咗個四十五歲、五十歲嗰度對話，我而唔係唔係，我係要個資料。我已經咧，而家係要求部門係要畀資料，好嘛？我作出呢個噉樣嘅要求㗎啦，嚇。

291
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,730
盧偉國議員。

292
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,100
誒，多謝主席。

293
00:58:41,540 --> 00:59:01,550
噉啊！其實頭先咁多委員同事咧，就即係我得你無論畀幾多壓力咧，就為要加快嗰個對於個即係單身飛將者加快呢個上樓速度咧，其實都係即係徒然嘅。點解咧？個現實的確係冇咁多公屋啊嘛。因為咧，之前一路講咧就話即係跟住呢五年咧。

294
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:18,470
就七萬五千個單位，噉啊收尾咧就挖空心思諗嚟諗去咧，多四千個到去到即係七萬九，咁似乎呢個都係不爭嘅事實㗎啦。頭先亦都有同事咧就話：喂，點解事一樣，以前又冇地，而家又揾到D出嚟咧？咁其實現實咧就係。

295
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:38,760
過往特區咧，就的確喺啲土地儲備方面嘅做啲嘢，係真係伐善捉殘。亦都因為如此咧，今天咧就要各方面諗計，包括咧要諗填海啊、諗巖洞啊等等。噉啊，即係我覺得咧喺今天呢個場合咧，如果將呢個問題擴到咁闊都冇用㗎啦，因為個現實就係話點樣分配。

296
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:51,520
而家喺跟住呢五年可見嘅有比較實質數量嘅公屋單位，喺噉嘅情況之下咧，嗰個優先咧係畀家庭、畀長者，呢個亦都應該係大家同意一個原則。

297
00:59:51,810 --> 01:00:11,820
咁所以咧，就我諗而家要我哋要睇咧，就係好啦。對於嗰啲非長者嘅申請咧，即係我哋點樣去盡可能都幫到嗰啲有即係迫切需要嘅咧噉樣喺噉嘅情況之下咧，即係我我哋當然係希望都能夠增加啲配額啦。不過咧，如果呢度呢度增加呢啲單位配額咧，又都要犧牲咗咧，即係。

298
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:31,830
呢個家庭同埋長者嘅上樓嘅時間，會可能會加長啦。噉，咁所以呢個係一個係好難做嘅平衡㗎。我呢度咧亦都要申報一下，因為我都係誒，即係房屋委員會下邊嘅建築同埋投票小組嘅成員。噉我亦都咧就可以咧，就誒，即係都同意咧，其實。

299
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,790
頭先處長都提過咧，就係。

300
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:52,930
其實對於三年上樓咧，不拎不休不嬲嘅承諾咧，並冇係面向所謂單身飛章者，因為呢個咧係冇可能咧，單身飛章者咧能夠三年上樓，呢個都係不爭嘅事實。即係如果如果有即係議員同事對呢個唔清楚咧，我就覺得比較奇怪，因為呢個都係即係一路都知道㗎啦。

301
01:00:53,210 --> 01:01:13,220
所以咧就，我覺得咧就，如果我哋希望啦嚇，即係當局咧，即係應該要諗下即係其他嘅一啲方法，譬如得不不少人提出咧，就一啲係咪短期一啲嘅青年即係宿舍啊呢一類，即係院舍形式嘅就唔係一個公屋單位啦。因為咧，其實我喺誒建築委員會咧。

302
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:26,030
亦都知道真係好睏難嘅。你有有限嘅地要起公屋，咁裏邊咧即係大單位、中單位、小單位、一人單位，點樣分配咧？呢個都係煞費思量，要希望做到個個平衡。

303
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:46,320
所以喺呢個單身非長者申請嗰度咧，我亦都同覺得咧嚇，其實就處方應該多做一啲即係誒誒研究嘅。嗱，我覺得咧應該有噉嘅治療，咩治療咧？就係對於呢啲特別係喺即係三十歲以下即係輪候嘅，其實個流動性啊，以往資料唔係容易，即係唔係難難做呢個。

304
01:01:46,320 --> 01:02:06,330
分析嘅啫，個流動性究竟會點？有譬如話有幾多咧，就好快就根本就嗰個收入已經係跌出呢個誒呢個合資格嘅範圍㗎啦。如果佢申請時間係學生嗱，我亦都要有一個好新嘅資料。香港大學公佈二零一二年咧畢業生就業調查，唔計高薪一族嘅醫生同埋牙醫。

305
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:26,670
本科生月入咧都去到萬七蚊，咁如果你係即係可能或者喺其他大專，未必啊個個都咁高人工。咁但係，假如你申請時間係大專生，好快可能咧就超過咗嗰個能夠申請公屋呢個收入嘅嘅限額㗎啦。咁所以喺呢一方面咧，係咪都應該啊對呢個六十七？

306
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:46,680
七percent嚇，辦呢個資料顯示辦咗六十七嘅七萬一千五百個嚇，係三十五歲以下嘅。呢呢啲咧做一啲個分析。咁如果我哋知道以往嘅流動性嗰個變化係點咧，咁對於預落嚟嗰個需求嘅預測咧，亦都有啲掌握啊嘛。講得好長啦，不過咧就主要都希望即係主方攞啲資料嚇。

307
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,530
誒。

308
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,520
呢個疫情咧就已經過咗中誒。

309
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:57,760
但係仲有咧，係連埋我仲有三位輪候，噉樣咧就我哋壓縮一個。

310
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:06,200
時間就連問連答三分鐘啦，減一啲啦。第二輪咧就安排唔到啦嚇。咁而家咧係請兩個議員。

311
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,100
主席。

312
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,560
即係紙不與怪力亂神。

313
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,290
即係做唔到嘢，唔好講。

314
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,540
係咪啊？未知生，焉知死？孔子教嘅咧。

315
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,220
呢個梁振英未當選之前咧，就話唔會為咗。

316
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,000
即係唔會攞位。

317
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:32,980
攞一張選票，任何一張選票，佢都唔會講一啲咧，佢做唔到嘅嘢，咁咪食住我嚇市啦！阿盧議員就話：原來係唔得嘅。

318
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,650
噉啊！算啦，講大話甩大牙。

319
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:43,720
嗱，唔係冇個噃，你而家改解決呢個長遠嘅房屋策略啊嘛。

320
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,730
你有租管，令到嗰啲人租屋住咪冇咁痛苦咯。

321
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:54,800
係咪啊？佢自動去租屋住㗎嘛？如果冇租盤，搞到租咁貴。

322
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,240
你做租賃都夾咗車。

323
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,700
呢個使乜時間啊，哥？

324
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,040
需要一分鐘一方尺嘅就企喺度講，我而家恢復租賃。

325
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,500
咁咪得㗎咯喎，又唔做。

326
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:23,340
係咪？點解你唔畀啲年青人攞到公屋咧？因為咧，你等佢供下樓啊，租下貴樓，然後到老嗰陣時就真係實在唔得，咪住公屋咯？係咪？噉我有手打手打油師啦，聽聽佢啦，拍字歌你唔識㗎啦，你係唔係中國人？

327
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:30,490
年輕就挨貴租，年老咧就住公屋，兩者皆不是，仲要住貴庵。

328
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:33,020
即係你一生人咧。

329
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:38,150
年老年年輕嘅時候咧，又捱貴租啦；年老咧，就畀翻間公屋你。

330
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:47,630
係咪啊？冇辦法啦。咁如果兩樣都唔中啊，唔好意思啊，買個即係貴啲嘅骨灰欖都都叫做安度晚年啦，就係咁啦。

331
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,150
係咪？

332
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:50,770
主席。

333
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,340
係咪冇辦法咧？

334
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,350
市建局呢個物體叫張振遠呢個梁超級梁粉做嘅。

335
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:06,680
佢而家重建就改啦噃，各位官員，你坐喺度，以前就話睇下。

336
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:13,390
邊個舊區應該重建？實際上係搞唔掂㗎啦，繼續來不可持續㗎啦。

337
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,960
而家唔係喎。

338
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:33,190
叫啲人去主動揾佢喎，仲話咧一定要用地產商合作喎，咁咪即是叫嗰啲蛇頭代表地產商去揾佢合作，再用呢個市建局嘅牌頭，再用呢一個地產商合作，係起多啲貴樓啦。

339
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,140
二度已經係啦，涼粉仲要做多兩年喎，呢個張振遠。

340
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,790
聽講話，佢有醜聞㗎咯喎！

341
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,270
係啊！

342
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:51,280
噉樣搞乜嘢啊！即係無謂講啦，講咗難堪啦。我只可以講梁振英呃得我哋太厲害啦。

343
01:05:52,040 --> 01:06:01,260
係咪啊？又話佢要因為解決呢個深層次矛盾喎？原來個深層次矛盾就係佢自己嘅，就係講咗做唔到。

344
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:12,620
呢個新聞又梗係唔得啦，點解決啊？柏志高，你教教佢點解決一個講咗之後做唔到嘅新聞事矛盾得唔得？誒，時間到啦，梁家傑議員。

345
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:32,950
我啱集中問一問第九段咧文件嗰度咧，噉就有講嗱，而家咧長遠呢個房屋誒策略督導委員會咧就諗住唔單止係喺年齡嗰度咧，你大過三十五歲就加多啲分畀你，咁逐年加即係大一歲加加幾多分咁啦，佢仲。

346
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:52,960
話咧就會研究能否以申請者嘅需要為基礎，定定配屋資格準則，以考慮申請人嘅個別情況。嗱，呢個係比較新嘅思維。我想問一問啊，秘書長咧，其實督導委員會係諗緊啲咩？即係譬如係咪話佢快啲結婚啊？即係就快。

347
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:01,410
結婚啊，或者係咪同父母同住啊？亦或係喺嗰區翻工啊？亦或點樣？我想大概知道下。係，秘書長。

348
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,070
嗯。

349
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:23,550
Mr. Chairman, as I say, these are recommendations that the steering committee has brought forth. What we will be doing is referring them to the housing authority for them to consider the detail. Because at the end of the day, the final decision rests with the housing authority, not the steering committee. In terms of the particular details, the idea I think is that if

350
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:43,560
If you can allocate additional points under the quota and points system to, for example, those between 45 to 55 in the first instance, then their opportunity, their chance of gaining access to a unit will be increased. Therefore, their waiting time will be reduced. That's the thinking behind this. But of course, I think it has to be for the housing authority.

351
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,010
要睇個view，因為。

352
01:07:45,450 --> 01:08:05,460
There still is this constraint on the total number of unit units that are going to be available. In terms of looking at the circumstances, the conditions that they're living in, they haven't come up with any specific recommendations, and I think that's quite sensible because the housing authority I think should have the final decision as to what those conditions should be.

353
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:16,540
啊！但係即係我想跟多一跟，就係有冇一啲即係方向性嘅宣示啊！即係呢個督導委員會，即係你係諗住佢邊方面啊？因為你。

354
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:36,940
講年齡就好客觀嘅，你睇你出生個年份係幾多噉，就計到啦，係嘛？噉你就屬於邊個組羣就加幾多分啦。咁但係你如果一提到呢啲個別嘅情況咧，可唔可以？即係因為我哋而家喺度係個互動緊啊嘛，同督導委員會噉，即係可唔可以講一講？即係有冇一啲方向性嘅？

355
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:52,000
嘅誒思維㗎，係秘書長。Mr. Chairman, there have been a number of ideas. I wouldn't say recommendations at this stage. Ideas such as you should look at their

356
01:08:52,280 --> 01:09:12,290
In addition to income and age, you should be looking at things like their family background. Are they from a split home or something like that? Are they divorced? Are they? Do they have circumstances that would lead you to believe that their circumstances are worse than anyone else? But I have to say, they have not yet come down.

357
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:17,770
到具體，因為這是個非常非常困難的領域，我誠實地説，我並不知道那個結果。

358
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:39,370
噉啊，主席，我就係諗住咧，方便我哋啲委員同佢哋互動咧。如果佢可以將嗰啲嘢交過嚟呢度咧，噉我哋可以有啲嚇，即係參與嘛噉樣。係啊，如果你仲有咩意見，你寫嚟，我哋照照。因為時間所限，好超曬時間㗎啦。好，阿馮建希員，你舉下手，畀埋你，然後我講埋最後。本來係接講埋我。

359
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:52,080
就冇㗎啦，不如一畀埋你嚇。我我問呢兩個去下個議程，你你講啊，馮議員。我想問你嗰個幻燈片嘅第尾二、誒第尾三個章咧，佢要督導委員會嘅考慮因素逐。

360
01:09:52,400 --> 01:10:12,410
我想問問咧，佢第一段講咧就話，督導委員會嘅誒睇法就喺非長者一人申請當中缺乏上向上流動能力同埋可能較難自行改善居住環境嘅人咧，應該優先獲配公屋。我想問你點樣將呢啲呢兩樣嘢咧，缺乏向上流動同埋可能較難自行改善居住環境嘅人？

361
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,040
是將佢定義到出嚟咧。

362
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:16,790
李書長。

363
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:37,450
Mr. Chairman, this is in the context of a discussion that members are having as to why young people predominantly seem to be applying through the quota and points system, and the thinking there was that if you look at the profile of young people, particularly the large numbers of young people that seem to be in or

364
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:57,460
Having received tertiary education, their opportunity to advance in terms of increasing their income, increasing their their social status is far greater than people who do not have tertiary level of education. And again, the figures show that people above I think it is thirty five, the num the numbers.

365
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:02,520
That have tertiary level of education is only about seven percent. So that's the comparison they were taking.

366
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:16,110
主席，我出咗誒以前我我都誒畀政府提啊，即係甚至周圍啲人話畀我聽，我都以為信嘅，即係話你有教育咧，你就掂㗎啦，讀多多多啲書就掂㗎啦。其實而家就讀多幾多書都唔掂。

367
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:36,400
即係如果你純住講個缺乏向上流嘅話，你大學生啊點都大學生咪又萬零蚊一個月開始時冇萬五蚊都有噉。即係呢個缺乏向上流。如果你唔清楚一個定義，即係純住話用佢教育背景，佢讀過中學㗎咧，佢讀過大學㗎啦，佢讀過碩士啊博士嘅，於是就當佢能夠向上流咧。呢個就係好好主觀嘅，你認為係嘅啫，但係現實。

368
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,840
個社會就基本上，你大學畢業生都唔掂喎。

369
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:59,470
主席，Mr. Chairman, that's one of the reasons why the recommendation is that we should actually look at what is their situation. Part of the logic behind this this idea of doing a review, even before they become eligible. Normally, as members know, we do the review of their income and asset just as they become eligible for allocation.

370
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:19,480
但係，我對嗰兩個嘅因素咧，我覺得都係新因素嚟，咪好誒，可以好誒。

371
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:26,600
即係主觀嘅，即係我就覺得嚴重誒，不不同意用呢兩個作為一個考慮因素。台長有冇回應啊，貝主任？

372
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:32,510
Mr. Chairman, that's exactly why we we want to talk to members. We'll reflect that to the members.

373
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:33,960
好。

374
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:41,740
誒，現在咧就係我係作為最後一位，作為議員個人咧提出我要問嘅問題。

375
01:12:42,270 --> 01:13:02,280
我咧就係有先講第一個意見咧，我希望誒當局咧考慮咧，就公聯會一早已經提出符合資格上樓嗰啲而未有配屋嗰啲咧，提供呢個租金津貼呢個第一個意見。第二咧，亦都請當局考慮下咧，點解有咁多係三？

376
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:22,290
十三個percent係屬於公屋居民咧，裏面係要分析係咪有一部分係由於你哋實施負政策，所以佢就被迫要早一日離開個家庭嚟去申請公屋咧。其實呢度佔幾多咧？你哋冇統計，我希望咧，你做咗分析，做咗統計咧。

377
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:25,360
補充呢個資料咧，係答翻我哋。

378
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:45,870
而家餘下嘅時間咧，我想係為一位姓黃嘅，其實佢已經長期舊年好多好多次咧，就去立法會申訴部進行申訴，就係就扣分制咧嚟投訴要求立法會處理嘅。終於今日咧，係有議程嚟到呢度。

379
01:13:45,870 --> 01:14:05,880
佢話：佢八年前就已經咧係排緊隊計分制。八年當時咧，佢話一百二十分就可以咧係上到公屋㗎啦。但係去到今日，佢話咧就要去到一百五十分，然後先上到公屋。因此，佢就提出個問題咧，點解？

380
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:25,890
佢作為係參與排隊計分，點解部門將個龍門成日搬咧？以前一百二十分，而家去到一百五十分，佢都仍然係未排到，係咪真係有噉嘅情況咧？呢個此其一。第二咧，佢亦都批評話咧，就係佢排嗰條龍。

381
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:45,900
但係到咁上下，你哋又會用各種嘅理由、各種嘅名義，就畀其他人排咗嘅前面啊！當然嗰啲都係有佢嘅需要，但點解會喺佢之前又有咁多人佔咗入去，令到佢排極都排唔到咧？八年啊！

382
01:14:45,900 --> 01:15:05,910
啦，一如咧呢度講，有成十萬人，如果係每年二千咧，要排五十年；如果咧係講緊呢一個非長者咧，七萬幾人咧，要排三十五點七五年。老實講，呢個根本嘅問題咧，係在於當局冇增建公屋。我而家。

383
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:09,950
而家請你答，係唔係嗰個計分制係不斷移動龍門？

384
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:30,850
Mr. Chairman, I obviously can't comment on an individual case, but if you let me have the details, I'll try and have a look at it and reply to him directly. But let me answer in a general sense, and I'll ask Anson to supplement. the The situation, as I briefly described earlier, is that people come onto the list with a certain number of points. They get extra points.

385
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,520
for every year they're on the list, however.

386
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:47,880
The points are determined as much by age as by the amount of time they go on the list. That's the two criterion. And if someone comes in above them at an older age, they'll get more points. And that's the way it works. I don't know if you have time to to get an explanation.

387
01:15:48,430 --> 01:16:08,440
就著個案咧，我會叫申訴部將佢再寫畀你哋。但係就著政策咧，你會後再補充，因為我都守規矩。你會後再補充究竟呢個計分制係咪不斷移動龍門，就係呢個問題，令到排隊啲人咧對佢哋唔公平。你會後再補充誒，各位，因為呢個議程咧就係已經過咗成。

388
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,650
係十幾分鐘啦，所以冇辦法咧，係係繼續呢個議程。而家我哋去到下個議程。

389
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:18,570
就係房屋委員會嘅副政策。

390
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:38,860
立法會文件C.B.括弧一九一九斜洞一二一三零三個文件，就政府當局就房屋委員會嘅副政策提供文件。首先就呢個問題咧，我想請係部門咧係係先介紹先。而家咧，我哋係。

391
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:48,560
係歡迎咧，阿廖敬良先生係助理署長咧，係出席呢個會議。噉就啊，秘書長而家係請你哋介紹。

392
01:16:48,840 --> 01:17:08,850
好嘛，Mr. Chairman. Again, I'll introduce briefly, and then I'll ask Anson to take us through the PowerPoint. As members know, the Housing Authority has in place the well-off tenant policies. The logic is simple: we want to rationalise the use of public housing resources. Public rental housing tenants who have income above the limits have to pay additional rent.

393
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:16,120
those with both income and assets exceeding the relevant limits are required to vacate their units.

394
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:27,840
We're well aware of the controversies over the well-off tenants policies, and for this reason, the long-term housing strategy steering committee has had thorough discussions on this particular issue.

395
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:36,230
Steering committee's taken note that there are actually divergent views in the community, and that there are arguments both for and against the policies.

396
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:56,520
At this stage, of course, it's not something that they've come to a particular view on. They have some ideas, but nothing particular. So we welcome members' views on the well-off tenant policies, and obviously comments on this will be collected together with those from the community in the forthcoming public consultation exercise.

397
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:10,670
And let me stress, all of these views will again be referred to the housing authority for a final decision, because again, it's a housing authority policy in this area. So, with those very brief remarks, I can ask Anson to take us through the PowerPoint.

398
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,260
好，阿黎生係咪？係，主席。

399
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:34,550
噉就我會好快咁同大家介紹翻，即係所謂嘅庫户政策啦。咁同埋係即係誒喺長遠房屋策略督導委員會嘅一啲討論嘅。咁好簡單咁講講啦。其實喺而家嘅政策之下咧，當任何住户搬入即係我哋公屋之後十年之後咧，就需要申報家庭入息。咁之後咧就每兩年申報入息一次嘅。咁如果佢哋嘅家庭入息係超逾咗。

400
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:54,560
超過咗嗰個誒入息限額嘅話咧，咁需要繳交額外租金嘅。咁比較誒清晰啲就係，如果佢哋嘅入息係等於輪候冊入息限額嘅兩到三倍之間咧，佢哋需要繳交係倍半嘅淨租金，另加差向。咁如果佢哋家庭入息係超過咗輪候冊入息限額三倍嘅話咧，噉佢哋需要繳交嘅係雙倍嘅淨租金。

401
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,330
同埋誒，即係加差響嘅。

402
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:15,940
咁另一方面啦，如果一啲而家已經繳交緊雙倍淨租金，另間出租户咧，佢哋往後亦都需要每兩年申報佢哋嘅資產嘅，咁如果發覺啦，佢哋係家庭入息嘅總額啦，同埋資產嘅淨值咧，都超過誒我哋嗰個即係房委會定下嘅入息同埋資產限額嘅話咧，咁需要遷出誒公屋單位嘅。

403
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:26,350
咁而家嘅其實資限額咧，就定咗喺我哋誒，譬如一三一四年啦，輪候冊入息限額嘅八十四倍嘅。咁而房委會亦都每每年咧係檢討輪候冊嘅入息限額嘅一次。

404
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:47,620
咁亦都有啲數據畀大家參考嘅。咁去到去年年底咧，喺七十萬個誒大概七十萬個房委會公屋住户當中咧，大概有一萬九千三百户咧係畀緊誒陪伴租金，有二千大概二千六百户咧係交緊一個雙倍嘅租金嘅。咁而亦都係大概三十户係繳交緊市值租金。如果即係話其實佢哋喺一年內咧。

405
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:55,010
係需要遷出公屋嘅，咁呢啲誒繳交緊額外租金嘅租户咧，佔房委會公屋住户咧，大概係百分之三左右。

406
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:16,110
噉，正如頭先，B書長介紹咧，其實誒誒，長遠房屋策略督導委員會咧，有留意到社會人士其實對於呢個 phụ 護政策咧係有好多唔同意見嘅。咁一方面咧，就係有意見認為咧， phụ 護政策係會令到部分高家庭嘅成員咧，佢哋為咗係誒唔誒，即係唔想佢哋為咗係維持翻佢哋公屋租嘅租約咧，就會係需。

407
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:36,120
將部分家庭成員係撇除翻、剔除翻喺佢哋公屋嘅嘅成員裏邊，咁誒呢個亦都係一個即係有部分誒維社會人士有意見啦。咁第二就係如果誒政府或者房委會係誒即係收緊執行扶補政策嘅話咧，可能會令到有部分租户佢哋誒要要係需要去投入去私人房屋市場啦，噉佢哋可能要租或者係買樓咧，噉。

408
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,120
都會對一啲產生一啲額外嘅房屋需求嘅。

409
01:20:40,470 --> 01:21:00,480
咁呢個係當然係一個部分意見啦。咁另一方面咧，亦都有誒部分嘅社會人士嘅意見咧，就睇翻而家公屋輪候拆嘅數申請數目係增加啦。咁平均輪候時間亦都增加緊嘅。咁所以亦都有意見認為咧，係應該係有必要咁繼續維持庫政策，甚至係收緊。咁舉例嚟講咧，有意見認為係咪需要一啲即係比較庫庫嘅租户佢哋係。

410
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:20,490
喺誒入息同埋水平都超出限額，先至遷離公屋啦。定係淨係喺入息或者資產其中一項超出超出有關限額咧，就已經需要遷離啦。咁另一方面亦都有意見認為，需唔需要檢討翻？譬如話而家誒佢哋第一次公屋公屋租户第一次申報入息嘅期限，譬如而家係十年嘅，咁亦都有意見認為需唔需要檢討咧？

411
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:26,910
咁同埋之後每兩年申報一次呢一個嘅安排，需唔需要檢討咧？咁亦都係有意見，覺得係需要再考慮嘅。

412
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:38,740
咁其實長遠房屋策略委員會咧都留意到呢方面嘅分分歧嘅意見咧，咁所以佢哋覺得誒誒應該係要再由房委會去考慮咧，係應唔應該去更新有關政策嘅。

413
01:21:40,080 --> 01:22:00,090
咁最後咧，就請委員咧係參考翻房委會嘅誒副護政策啦。咁同埋，頭先我介紹嘅係長遠房屋策略督導委員會就住嗰個政策作出嘅討論嘅。噉我哋會喺嗰個長遠房屋策略文諮詢文件裏邊咧，進一步咁邀請公眾咧就住呢個副護政策交畀誒發表意見啦。咁最終咧係會交畀房委會作最終嘅決定嘅。唔該曬，主席。

414
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,440
誒。

415
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:16,010
咁咧就誒多謝你介紹。而家咧就係報咗名係有四位議員。咁咧仲有冇誒委員咧想發問嘅？得，要大家盡快舉手啦。係誒，我容易分配時間。副主席，仲有副主席。

416
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:24,160
我倒讀個名嚇，誒梁梁耀忠、胡志偉、梁國雄、麥美娟、謝偉全。

417
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:30,470
噉就我本人最後一個啦嚇，仲有冇委員想發言啊？

418
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:33,130
咁暫時咧就係。

419
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:53,560
四分鐘先啦嚇。阿梁耀忠議員，誒主席就睇翻文件所講咧，即係如果真真正正陷入呢一個嘅附嘅名，即係定義底下裏邊嚟講話咧，只不過係喺七十萬裏邊嘅嘅公屋住户裏邊咧，都大概只係都唔夠二萬嘅一個住户，咁其實就佔咗就百分之三左右。

420
01:22:53,560 --> 01:23:13,570
咁其實個數目就非常之少嘅，咁但係帶嚟嘅影響實係非常之大喎。咁點大咧？就係至多限度咧，就每兩年咧就要係即係七十萬啦，即係全港嘅市民咧都要係即係輪流噉樣去申報呢個資產。而啲資產咧係對一啲嘅家庭住户嚟講咧，帶嚟好多精神壓力嘅，因為填寫嗰時咧好睏難，唔知點填寫，一好驚就一。

421
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:24,690
一填寫錯咗嘅話咧，就畀你捉佢咧，就話即係話你係即係隱瞞啊，或者虛報啊噉樣咧，就可能咧就犯刑事罪行，甚至乎咧就連嗰個嘅居住單位咧權利咧都未剝奪嘅。

422
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:37,250
咁但係不過咧，能夠可以即係帶嚟一個受惠嘅地方幾大咧？就喺頭先講咗啦，即係大二萬户咧，係交倍半啊、兩倍啊，甚至乎係三倍啊，或者將來會離開噉樣樣，但係數字非常之少。

423
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:57,540
咁所以變咗能夠可以騰空出嚟嘅單位，從同原先所希望啊騰空出嚟空空置單位咧，其實唔多嘅。變係講係噉，所以咧就係政策所用嘅人力物力，即係消耗啲非常之大，但係效益咁少。而唔單止噉樣樣喎，我唔知咧，即係秘書長就喺你講一講啦嚇。就係因為政府嘅政策。

424
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:16,530
帶嚟嘅後遺症幾大？譬如我自己見到有幾樣咧，係後遺症非常之大嘅，就等於呢個多度委員會嘅考慮嘅其中之一樣嘅A嗰個所講啦，就好多嘅家庭嘅住户咧，因為噉樣樣而係搬離開咗嗰個原有單位，咁造成咩後果咧？造成其中一個就係所謂老人村啊。

425
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:36,820
即係見到我哋屋好多屋村咧，就老化嘅。其中之一原因咧就乜嘢咧？年輕人為咗係即係免得受受依種嘅所謂即係陪伴兩輩嘅嘅影響嘅話咧，然後就搬搬嚟咗去，搬嚟咗成個村變咗係即係老人村，老人村咧產生嘅就好多老人問題啦。噉啊要係即係點樣處理咧？噉樣樣咁其實好多問題出喺度。

426
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:56,830
我哋都好難去處理噉，呢個第係其中一個問題。依第二個問題咧，就係頭先我係上一節嗰個討論嘅主席，就係講單身人士啦。咁頭先頭先嗰個數字裏面咧，有三成三嗰啲人單身人士咧，都係係公居民嘅。噉啊，相信好好絕大部分咧都可能係年青人啦。嚇，頭先所講嘅嘢噉樣噉，亦都係咧造成。

427
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:11,380
成一個後果啦，佢點樣樣咧？佢唔去住嗰度，即係唔住喺同屋企人住，就走去咩？再要排隊，再另一個嘅嘅一個公屋單位嘅誒輪候噉樣樣。而喺呢個問題上，嗰我哋過去都都講過，呢種做法裏邊咧，即係得不。

428
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:31,930
誒得得唔到個奇果啊！個果就係乜嘢咧？就希望攞騰啲資源出嚟，但點知調翻轉咧，係反而係係加重你資源嘅負擔添。噉我所以想問一問立委書長啦，你依個檢討裏邊咧，好似太過狹窄啦，即係唔夠詳詳細，同社會嘅問題裏邊咧都冇去再做一畀啲時間佢答啦。咁所以我想問一問立委書長。

429
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:43,580
咁咧，你會做一個更加深入嘅研究，依個扶助政策所帶嚟嘅對於屋邨社區發展同埋家庭影響，乃至社會影響咧，有幾深咧？噉樣，李處長。

430
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,570
Mr. Chairman.

431
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:54,180
我 actually take the point entirely. This is a very difficult policy area for the housing authority and for the housing department because

432
01:25:54,570 --> 01:26:00,460
Unfortunately, you do have to find out information about people's income and asset limits.

433
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:11,430
The logic I can understand. The logic is simple. We have a limited supply. We should encourage people who can otherwise afford to move out to move out. That's not unreasonable.

434
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:31,720
I think over the over the last few years, where there hasn't been the home ownership scheme opportunity for people to move on, that's been more difficult. And I think that's why you have a situation where people have been very concerned that if their if their income or asset limit exceeds the limit, they don't really have an opportunity. But as we start the process of

435
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,770
homeownership scheme being built.

436
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:40,960
being able to give people a way through, then I think it's still appropriate to have this check.

437
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:49,090
to ensure that the people who deserve public rental housing most, the people who are most in need, are those that get it, and that's the logic for it.

438
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,820
阿部志偉員。

439
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:51,950
再轉。

440
01:26:52,230 --> 01:27:12,240
都係主席。其實我睇呢一個 phụ 政策咧，我最擔心嘅咧就係喺我哋傾唔到呢一個放寬之前咧，就進行緊就係收緊嗰個 phụ 政策嘅討論。呢個你睇文件咧，其實已經係講咗兩三兩三段嘅文字都係噉樣講。我就希望提一提咧，就係即係 phụ 政策佢。

441
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:32,250
會有好多相關嘅政策咧，引致到佢嘅成效係出現咗啲問題。譬如我哋冇咗呢個居屋政策之後咧，係令到原先負政策配合住居屋政策咧，去鼓勵就係有能力嘅住户咧，係要搬嚟嗰個單位，然後騰空嗰個嘅係公屋單位出嚟嘅。呢個係原先嘅諗法嚟嘅。不過你知我哋過去嗰七八年咧。

442
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:52,260
停咗呢個居屋嘅供應咧，咁所以個問題就複雜咗嘅。第二個當然亦都係喺呢幾年裏邊咧，其實我亦都睇到喺另一個角度咧，就係嗰個嘅輪候插入式咧上升咧，係某程度上都係舒緩咗，就係話過往嗰個嘅係即係負政策所帶嚟嘅不便嘅嚇，因為過往輪候。

443
01:27:52,260 --> 01:28:12,270
插息係低嘅時候咧，係往令到咧係三兩個人一齊做嘢咧，就可能出咗嗰個嘅係問題。噉我當然都想就係話，即係房屋處或者係啊秘書長，可唔可以咧係提供翻就係話咧，你所提嘅呢個數，即係譬如隨住你嗰個嘅係誒輪候插息嘅上升嘅時候咧。

444
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:30,250
係相應翻嗰個 phụ 政策所帶嚟嘅影響嗰個，即係人數嘅變化，等我哋都可以掌握下嗰個形勢。但係我同意同事另一個説法，亦都係希望咧係即係秘書長，你係要小心處理，因為咧我哋喺做區嘅時間咧，往往都係會誒。

445
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:50,890
要即係我要請就話你哋咧，係要小心去注意填寫嗰份嘅入息申報表嘅時間咧，因為你哋嘅要求就係，如果佢有任何嘅錯誤咧，就會係牽引到就係佢有一個蓄意蓄意嘅係即係隱瞞啦，誒虛假情虛假資料嘅時間咧，係引致到佢係喪失個居住權利嘅。

446
01:28:51,010 --> 01:29:11,020
噉我呢一度咧，我就即係誒希望就係話，即係處方同埋呢個係即係秘書長咧，可以留意翻。其實我哋會見到好多時填呢啲表格時間咧，其實往往係嗰個老人家去填咧係得唔到一個全面嘅資訊嘅，而大家咧亦都因為過往咧係比較上可能係寬鬆嘅年代。

447
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:31,030
引落嚟嘅一啲經驗咧，係引引申嘅時候咧，係會令到一個誤會。噉我希望就係咧，即係處科喺處嘅呢啲所謂嘅虛假資料嗰個申報嘅時間咧，係反而係要有多啲嘅係教宣傳啦，同埋協助去填寫呢一份表格咧，係確保就呢啲嘅問題咧，係唔會出現影響咗佢哋居。

448
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,860
對住權利。

449
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:52,150
非常謝謝。Mr. Chairman, in fact, we do take a lot of care to make sure that we don't overreact in situations like that. We do actually try to help people to make sure that they do provide the information that they know what they have to provide, and we check on that. And I think the fact that we only have I think it's thirty currently thirty.

450
01:29:52,150 --> 01:30:12,160
tenants that are subject to the the notice to quit because of being exceeding both income and asset shows that we're actually very careful on this. In addition to that, of course, we do have an appeal mechanism, so that if people feel that the reason they've been given these notices

451
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:32,170
是 unreasonable for whatever reason. They can appeal to the independent appeal panel, and they will take a look at these cases. So, I want to assure members that while the system is in place, and I think it's right that it has to be there. 主席，我只係提一提啫，希望嗰個係上訴嘅機制咧，都真係可以畀一個機會呢一個嘅公屋住户啦，一係填寫。

452
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:52,180
如果佢第一次嘅犯錯咧，希望都儘量咧係即係有個寬鬆嘅態度，可唔可以？嗯，Mr. Chairman，we we do we do have a dialogue with them. If there is a particular problem, we always check the information. It isn't just the based on the declaration.如果見到就好似好死噉樣樣咯，希望喺呢一點上邊能夠寬鬆啲，因為呢個咧係。

453
01:30:52,180 --> 01:31:00,040
係會令到你能夠喺維護成個機制過程裏邊咧，唔會有過分壓力畀咗住户嘅，代主席。好，誒，表達咗意見，希望。

454
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,580
部門留意，阿梁國雄議員。

455
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:11,110
即係我就係住喺公屋嘅議員啦，都畀本會不少議員攞嚟做話題啦，係咪？

456
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:22,540
噉啊！攻擊我冇乜所謂嘅，係咪？有人審查㗎嘛？如果我果然係好似佢話霸住嘅話咧，噉就應該坐監啦，就唔應該坐喺度嘅。

457
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:30,870
嗱，呢班噉嘅喪心病狂嘅人咧，即係為咗攻擊我咧，根本就唔計個即係個社會後果嘅。

458
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,940
第一，你副政策嘅時候三廿年前。

459
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:41,410
就係希望公屋嘅居民有個梯階走出公屋。

460
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,710
喺呢個誒居屋嗰度咧，騰空啲單位。

461
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:48,950
噉啊！解決你哋嗰個供應嘅問題。

462
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,950
你家居屋冇咗。

463
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,280
點搞咧？

464
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:55,880
你叫佢出翻去又買間屋啊！

465
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:03,640
咁人哋咪窮則變，變則通咯，係咪？咪走出去再輪輪候公屋咯，咪搞到你條龍長啲咯。

466
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:08,730
係咪啊？噉你有個客觀嘅準則㗎嘛？八十四倍。

467
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,790
係咪？咁呢個八十四倍係點計出嚟嘅咧？

468
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,210
係咪即係話佢可能畀到首期啦？

469
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:16,770
係咪？

470
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:22,940
差咁多啦。咁但係佢嗰個income嗰啲可能都供唔到樓嘅喎，除非兩套計。

471
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,620
係咪？

472
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,370
第二就係你計嗰陣時，咪計佢買公居屋，抑係買私樓嘅咧？

473
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,140
因為買夾屋，佢啲郊野又唔存在啦。

474
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,670
即係八十四倍呢樣嘢。

475
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,650
係咪？

476
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:39,540
我就覺得。

477
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:44,680
講嚟講去，你自己公屋供應唔夠，你揾嗰三個percent嘅人嚟搞係冇用。

478
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,850
佢出翻去捱翻貴租。

479
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,090
就住劏房，咁即係其實第二個劏房嘅人。

480
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,650
走喺上，有間公屋啫嘛。

481
01:32:55,390 --> 01:33:03,860
冇乜意，你可能有啲公平嘅意就係話，哦，既然家你有錢過人，你去住居住劏房啦，咁第二個住咗你間屋啦，係咪啊？

482
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:08,160
而第二個問題最好笑嘅就以我為例。

483
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:19,250
而家我走去聽嗰班噉嘅梁晶晶啊、吳吳亮星嗰包講，真係走去買間居屋，如果有錢嘅話，或者做一間居屋。

484
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,700
我一個人住五百尺嘅地方。

485
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:28,170
係咪嘥咗五百尺嘅地方？嗰個嗰個嗰個單位原本係可以畀一家人住㗎嘛？

486
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:32,000
係咪呢班人係食屎屙飯嘅？我諗嘢。

487
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:38,350
即係完全唔係從一個誒屋宇嘅流動同埋。

488
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,160
啊，點樣樣將嗰啲人？

489
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,350
又同跟跟住佢嗰個入息鏈上升嘅時候，配置一啲。

490
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,430
去合適去消費嘅房屋去考慮。

491
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:58,010
咁而家你呢個政策咧，我講咩啊？老人村嘅政策就我自己條村咧，全部都係老人家嚟嘅。

492
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,450
一就新移民。

493
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:01,690
你又搞到佢哋噉嘅樣。

494
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:10,510
一間你又翻轉頭係陪翻老人家住啦，叫人個仔女喺附近嗰度揾揾翻間屋喎，你真係講。

495
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,880
唉，無謂講啊！真係嗱，老實講。

496
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:16,220
我就係住老人屋㗎啦。

497
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,930
我就係六十歲啦。

498
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,740
係。

499
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,220
你講，我唔走嘅。

500
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:24,740
我亦都歡迎大家嚟查。

501
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,960
查下有幾多資產？

502
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,780
就咁簡單啦！我唔係話我個人發言。

503
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,510
我係為你拆散人哋嘅家庭。

504
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:40,920
為你將啲誒年輕人趕出去住劏房，然後再排隊，人哋間屋企住都唔得。

505
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,870
已經慘啦，跟屋企住。

506
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:47,860
冇嘢講。

507
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,190
我記得望兩清清真係。

508
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:53,880
瞓唔著覺嗰陣時，諗下佢都一世人，都未住過公屋嘅啦，佢。

509
01:34:55,910 --> 01:35:08,990
你唔使部門回應啦，係嘛？唔使㗎啦，我我聽話梁晶晶聽到啦。美麥美娟語員，即係我我都唔明咧誒，或者可能我嘅嘅中文比較差。

510
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,610
有個副政策咧。

511
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:19,080
都算係一個長遠嘅房屋策略咧。咁呢個督導委員會真係做到冇有做？

512
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:30,900
貨物政策講緊兩萬零，佔七十幾萬個公屋單位都唔，頭先阿梁宏講幾幾個percent咋？你搞個幾個percent就叫做一個長遠嘅房屋策略？

513
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:40,400
咁呢個督導委員會係咪真係冇其他應該做嘅咧？我成日覺得一啲策略嘅嘢，我哋講策略性嘅嘢，係咪應該做一啲長遠嘅規劃？

514
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:52,970
我哋嘅香港究竟幾時要起幾多個公幾多個居屋幾多個私人樓喺呢啲做功夫，而唔係噉樣搞嗰兩萬幾人係嘛，兩萬幾户嘅單位係嘛？

515
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:58,500
即係如果咁都叫做策略，咁即係我哋香港呢啲督導委員會真係冇咩好做㗎啦，睇落。

516
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:04,650
第一第二樣嘢咧，就係扶助政策其實個目標，我哋同意嘅一樣嘢。

517
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:16,350
我哋公屋資源咧係應該要善用，應該幫到啲有需要嘅人。扶户政策當年做嘅時候，就係希望可以令到公屋住會有個流轉。嗰時仲有居屋。

518
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:36,650
但係依家就幾年係冇居屋，而家突然間先至話今次開始，今年開始又有翻居屋。但係個問題就係我我諗啊，呢個福咩什麼長遠房屋策略督導委員會咧，佢哋應該要做嘅嘢咧，應該係諗點樣幫住喺公屋裏邊嘅居民有一個流轉嘅機會。

519
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:40,390
例如，增加多啲居屋嘅興建。

520
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:51,190
佢哋應該建議政府喺地呀，喺各方面做功夫喺你哋處方裏邊嘅建造工程裏邊點樣加快？

521
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:58,580
而唔係喺度咧搞嗰幾二萬幾個富户，你逼到人哋出去之後，佢都揾唔到樓住噉，但係佢踎街啊！

522
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:07,330
正如係咪又係話住個富貴啲嘅劏房咧？好似阿阿局長講嗰啲間得好市正嘅劏房咧。

523
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:27,890
唔通嗌佢住嗰啲咩？所以我諗咧，即係第一，輔助政策，我哋認為需要公屋嘅資源，要係好合理地畀一啲需要嘅人。但係如果我哋要令到公屋居民流轉，係唔能夠單靠呢個輔助政策，我哋有措施有策略啊！真係點？

524
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:35,280
協助佢哋可以喺出邊去揾到佢哋嘅合理居所。上一次我哋開會講合理居所。

525
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:55,810
噉你係咪要佢搬出去一住一間市正嘅㗎

526
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:59,690
係噉，透過扶護政策去將一啲年輕人咧，係趕出去。

527
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,930
咁而家個個就唯有咧。

528
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:20,200
就搬出去住之後咧，就全部整翻啲老人村喺度。即係我，我唔知道咧。究竟第一希望嗰個噉嘅策略委員會咧，佢真係諗下啲實事求是，即係做啲策略出嚟，點樣幫呢啲公屋居民有個流轉嘅機會啦？係，部門。嗯，Mr. Chairman。

529
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:37,330
This is just one of many issues that the steering committee is looking at, but it is actually quite an important issue because at the end of the day, one of the aspects that we need to look at is the rational use of those resources we already have, and you know we come across instances where people actually own property.

530
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:58,430
they own residential property. The question, therefore, is why are they then living in public rental housing estates? I think it's entirely rational for us to be looking and asking those questions, so that those people who don't need to live in public rental housing move out, move into their own accommodation, and then people who really do need to move in, move in.

531
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:59,750
said that, of course.

532
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:09,450
As you can see from the figures, it is by far the minimum that we can do. We're not pushing this as an aggressive policy. It's a proportionate policy in the circumstances.

533
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:30,270
誒接住係副主席啊，謝偉全議員。多謝主席。誒，頭先啱講咗一輪後，嗰個公屋嗰啲有二十幾萬有多。咁其實就誒都講咗呢善用公屋嗰個資源咧，其實誒比更加有實質同埋需要嘅人咧，喺呢個原則之下。

534
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:35,600
咧，其實我個人覺得嗰個負政策係有需要去維持嘅。

535
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:51,260
但係我覺得即係喺呢個誒長遠房屋督導委員會咧，我覺得佢要諗一樣嘢咧，即係你對於所謂誒住緊公屋，因為我既定咗一啲或者準則咧，佢哋變咗係一個富户咧。

536
01:39:51,600 --> 01:40:11,610
個問題咧係點樣令呢啲人咧，即係有呢個往上流動喺資業階梯嗰度咧，即係可以一路改善。咁呢度反而我覺得係一個長遠嘅策略咧，要定出嚟。因為點解我睇而家你譬如話最近當然你六友亞苑嗰個簡屋簡樓嗰度咧，我諗某。

537
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:31,620
嗰個程度反映到咧，錄表嗰啲人咧，我覺得相對咧就個興趣好似低。咁究竟個問題係乜嘢咧？係唔係即係話個階梯嚟講對佢哋唔吸引咧？亦或你要喺個策略啊，即係檢討下有咩需要嚇，令到呢啲人改善之中咧，佢又願。

538
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:51,630
意咧，其實向來都好似冇睇嘅，只係話我哋話又又有居屋啦。咁但係啲居屋係咪適合佢咧？或者係咪即係覺得喂佢係誒誒誒，譬如有資產啊，但係佢嗰個收入係有問題咧等等。咁點樣將佢係咪即係嗰個階梯攬得太寬咧？噉樣？

539
01:40:51,630 --> 01:41:01,980
我覺得即係可能，我會認為嗰個房屋督導委員會其實真係要睇呢樣嘢，畀啲意見翻即係政府喺呢度。

540
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:22,320
咁另外我想問一問一個問題咧，就係話關於嗰個計嗰個薪金嘅問題咧。咁而家咧，我知道有好多人咧，可能嗰個薪金咧，或者佢有啲誒誒誒，佢可能喺誒內地工作，咁嗰啲又計唔計咧？噉樣或者計算方面誒有冇困難咧？啊！

541
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,990
呢方面我都想誒，或者係誒，畀啲獎去答答。唔該，主席。

542
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:29,710
嗯。

543
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:41,620
Mr. Chairman, this issue of a ladder, I think, is is is relevant because up until the the announcement in two thousand and eleven of the reintroduction of HOS.

544
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:48,780
It was, I think, not impossible for people to find relatively cheap flats. You could find

545
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:56,980
一兩萬美元 flats，但係佢哋喺remote locations， and it doesn't necessarily mean that people will be prepared to move out to those units.

546
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:04,300
by introducing the HOS, I think the the ladder is reinstated. Of course, it takes a little bit of time for us to.

547
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,160
Get the programme up to full speed.

548
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:20,040
但係，最近 sale of Greenview Villa，和 sale 現在進行中嘅 surplus HOS 係由 Housing Authority，顯示出有真係嘅興趣嚟自 Greenformers。

549
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:34,500
But of course, they will always look at their individual circumstances. We we don't have the ability to force people out, but we must encourage them. And I think using the well-off tenant policy is a good way to encourage people to move out.

550
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:54,790
因為，他們然後move into a situation where they get permanent accommodation， they're not subject to future reviews on their income or asset limits， and therefore， I think as the housing the home ownership scheme projects start to kick in in a bigger number， seventeen thousand and thereafter five thousand， then

551
01:42:54,790 --> 01:43:14,800
The ladder becomes even more obvious for those people in the the home the public rental housing levels. In terms of of looking at the criteria, which is the other point you made, I think that's quite right. But I think it's for the housing authority to look at that, because at the end of the day, it's the housing authority that must change the policy in order.

552
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,480
to better reflect the situation, but we will reflect that to them.

553
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,060
好。

554
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,730
接住係田北辰議員。

555
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:25,300
都係主席。

556
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,720
我認同咧，而家。

557
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,920
我呢個房屋政策咧，係缺乏咗。

558
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,970
一啲誒。

559
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:39,890
供應令到住居屋嘅人咧，當佢去到某個水平咧，可以真係。

560
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,810
即係搬出嚟。

561
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:53,090
誒噉，但係遠需求不如近貨啦。我都要等佢慢慢增加土地供應啊，可能將來起翻多啲居屋啊噉。但係就目前嚟講咧嚇。

562
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,210
我就覺得咧，極之。

563
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:00,700
認同呢個扶護政策，不但止我極之認同咧。

564
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,480
雖然個數字唔多。

565
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:13,830
而家咧過咗呢個入息上限同埋資產限額，收到通知要十二個月內搬走啲咧，我相信都冇萬萬聲嘅，可能幾千嘅啫。

566
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:17,890
但係公義上咧，我覺得呢樣嘢一定要做。

567
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:19,860
如果唔係咧，就係。

568
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,920
就係天下嘅笑話。

569
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,060
咁但係咧，我覺得而家我上朝提及嘅今日係咪真係冇流轉咧？

570
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:30,680
喺一個。

571
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:35,590
私人嘅居屋嘅市場，保曬地價㗎啦。

572
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:39,520
嚇！上次我都講過啦，我問過秘書長嘅。

573
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:46,860
你而家美孚有個清麗苑啊，沙田有個花園城、河畔花園，四五百尺單位，而家賣緊三百萬嘅。

574
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:50,520
三百萬乜都包曬㗎啦，經理框啦。

575
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:52,830
你話七成按揭？

576
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,090
噉啊，九十萬。

577
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:59,800
誒落誒呢個誒downpayment。

578
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,850
噉啊，跟住咧，每個月供萬一。

579
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,350
噉你睇睇而家？

580
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:10,280
而家我哋嘅資產限額全部高過九十萬好多嘅。

581
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:22,150
點解我哋資產上下額誒匯得去到一個咁高嘅水平，先至叫佢哋出去出邊私人市場揾咧？九十萬而家買到啊，又有成交喎呢堆嘢。

582
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,570
噉你話佢供唔起？

583
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:29,040
但係佢而家萬一一個月，你都唔使四萬五萬。

584
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:34,110
嘅入息一個月，去供萬一蚊嘅樓啊！

585
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:41,380
咁所以我咧就上次問我秘書長，我話：而家你呢個庫户嘅數字點解定得咁寬鬆？

586
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,830
咁而家出邊嘅樓市回落，竟然呢次檢討咧，仲加。

587
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:51,030
真係㗎，加咗㗎，全部啲數字加咗幾千幾百㗎。

588
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:59,590
噉啊！我好希望今日知道，其實佢今日呢班人絕對有能力出去出邊喺附近嘅居屋市場買現成單位。

589
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:12,300
啊！點解仲可以有呢啲咁寬鬆嘅限制咧？係秘秘書長。嗯，Mr. Chairman，I I I think the thresholds are reasonable in the circumstances.

590
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:30,980
You you don't look at it just in in terms of one particular point in time. These are situations that do change over time. And as the honourable member knows, the last few years, well we haven't really had HOS, we haven't really had an alternative. The the cost of getting into private housing is relatively very very high.

591
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:51,300
The question I think which he's asking, and I think it's quite reasonable, is should that still be the case? Should it still be set at eighty four times? Should it still be set at exceeding the income threshold? Those are the things that I would expect the housing authority to look at when this is referred to them for consideration, because clearly we want the

592
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:57,870
policy to be in step with the current situation, both in the market and in the society.

593
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:09,780
sorry，excuse me，the numbers that I quoted as an all-time high，this is based on recent transaction figures，and everybody know，recently the land prices is historical high。

594
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:30,070
所以，無論在過去或在未來，我唔見得我們應該為任何比現時更糟的情況做準備。我只係簡單地指出，這些數字，我唔知佢哋係由邊度嚟嘅，84倍。我同意你嘅講法，所以我係喺度討論84倍嘅問題。我想補充嘅係，正如我講嘅，我認為呢個問題係由房屋署負責。

595
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:50,080
look at，because when you do a review, you look at all aspects of it. How is applied? Where would the review be done？誒，佢哋會考慮呢方面嘅問題㗎啦。田園，而家係我用我議員自己哦。啊，國家議員啊，畀你講先啦嚇。國家奇議員，你準備好未啊？啊，OK㗎啦嚇。主席，我就想問一個係誒。

596
01:47:50,080 --> 01:48:01,950
具體嘅問題，即係透過主席問秘書長，因為咧而家其實咧就係第一嗰個所謂嗰個負咧嗰個數字咧佔，亦都我係睇到個文件咧唔係好多係百分之三嘅啫。

597
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:22,240
其實一個比較合理嘅做法咧，就點樣將呢一啲誒過咗嚇，即係無論佢入息嗰個限額或者資產值咧，我講係超過而喺而家個政策之下，要要佢離開嗰批嘅人咧，其實應該係用一個方法盡量引導佢咧。一係就租者置其屋，一係就居屋。

598
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,150
啲兩個方法咧，係去吸引到佢。

599
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:41,430
如果而家你用呢一啲嘅一刀切嘅方法趕佢走咧，其實幫唔到呢件事，可能只會令到更加多嘅即係怨氣係畀誒政府或者房署嘅。咁喺你嚟緊，雖然居屋嘅單位啊，即係政府而家係相當少嘅。

600
01:48:41,710 --> 01:49:01,720
為咗去對應鼓勵呢一批嘅即係誒富户啦，即係高過而家講嗰個誒輪候制嗰個入息三倍，或者係嗰個入息嗰個限額八四倍呢一紮嘅話咧，你哋可唔可以或者諗一啲方法係將佢哋咧係盡快納入居屋嗰部？

601
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:16,380
部分嘅令到佢啊，一方面佢可以揾咗一個解決佢居住居住嘅問題，第二亦都係即係我同意係可以誒多啲嘅誒，如果佢有能力，如果佢願意嘅話咧，多啲公屋咧係誒畀其他人去用。

602
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:36,950
第二個咧就係一個輪候層入息嗰個水平。零二年嗰個咧，根據零二年居屋當時個定價咧，大家知個平均折購價啦。去到今日咧，嗰啲樓價都係相當即係離譜，相當驚人啦。即係大家都知噉，政府冇理由唔知嘅。你可唔可以話翻畀我聽？如果用你哋？

603
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:51,360
而家個平均樓價咧，係咪呢一個八十四八十四倍嘅入息上限嗰度咧，係應該係相應咧係增加，可能係即係百幾倍嘅咯。因為事實上你趕佢走嘅話，亦都係相當之。

604
01:49:51,660 --> 01:50:08,390
係誒，即係冇陰公嘅嘢嚟嘅。啲大家都知道，而家啲樓價咧，基本上咧高到咧，無論佢租租金又好，或者樓價都好咧，都係相當係令到，就算呢一啲所謂富户咧，係難以去誒去誒去承擔兩個問題啊，主席。

605
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:11,530
Mr. Chairman, the first one.

606
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,130
我我我諗。

607
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:34,420
It's it's correct to say that if there is a proper proper ladder the people can move into that's what we should be encouraging to do. So I don't disagree with you that if we have an HOS sales program ongoing and not periodic as it is at the moment that's the obvious way for us to encourage them to move out. So I would certainly agree with that. In the meantime, they.

608
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:54,430
There are already opportunities for people to move into HOS through the secondary market, because as you know, HOS owners in the secondary market who don't wish to pay premium can sell to greenform owners, greenform tenants without paying the premium. So that opportunity.

609
01:50:54,430 --> 01:51:14,440
already exists and indeed I would expect people to look at that as their first option. But some people, as I said before, the eighty-four times limit is is not that's the minimum. There are people that we come across that have much much more than that. Some already own properties, so you have to look at the individual circumstances of those people that are caught out.

610
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:34,450
The second issue about HOS pricing, there is a pricing methodology. I don't think we have enough time to get into that right here. But basically, we look at the market rates within the location of the units to be disposed of. We then look at the affordability.

611
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:44,310
of the potential tenants within the market, and then we take a view. It's exactly the same methodology as would apply in 2002 as it applies today, and I think.

612
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:53,510
it it sets it according to affordability. That's the key issue. The absolute price and rate will vary because of the the location, floor etc.

613
01:51:53,790 --> 01:52:00,610
好，而家咧就我再係最後一位議員咧問問題，兩個問題。第一個問題咧就係。

614
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:14,490
政府咧會唔會咧？誒，再重新啟動嗰個租者置其屋計劃？一如咧好多委員咧都提出呢個問題。除咗居屋係一個出路之外，如果嗰啲

615
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:35,080
收入或者係家庭咧，都係啊經濟上面比較鬆動嘅，亦都有條件嘅。佢又未必係買得起外面嘅私人樓或者居屋，但佢可以咧買翻自己嘅單位嘅。咁呢一點其實當佢會唔會重新檢討咧？呢呢個係第一個問。

616
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,930
即係租置計劃。

617
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:51,320
第二個問題咧，同我哋上一個議程都係有關嘅。上一個議程我哋睇到所謂嘅呢個單身嘅非長者申請人咧，嚟自公屋居民有三十三個percent。

618
01:52:51,600 --> 01:53:11,610
其實當局有冇分析呢三十三個percent嘅公屋居民咧，有幾多嘅嚟自所謂嘅富户家庭咧？其實我係睇到咧，就係有好多所謂被納入為富户嘅公屋居民嘅住户咧，為咗去即係。

619
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:31,620
唔使咧，係日後咧被刪除户籍，佢就將咧自己有收入嘅仔女咧就刪除啊，啊叫佢搬出去，或者咧係申請公屋，亦都造成咧呢個政策咧另一個歧義嘅產物。咁呢一點啊，你哋有冇分析嗰三啊三percent有幾多係嚟自？

620
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:34,910
而呢個係所謂嘅負咧，兩個問題。

621
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:43,680
Mr. Chairman, I have to be direct. We have really no plans to re-activate the tenant purchase scheme.

622
01:53:44,560 --> 01:54:04,570
as far as as the department is concerned, it's actually a very difficult scheme for us to administer, and there are many problems that have arisen: management problems, control problems, disputes between the rental units within the TPS estates and the ownership units, disputes involving the owners' corporation.

623
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:08,460
所以，我們不有任何計劃去再啟動那政策。

624
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:19,960
On the second one, looking at the the non-elderly applicants and and what analysis we do, perhaps Anson could comment on that for you.

625
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:40,360
阿黎生，係主席。噉就誒，我哋其實根據喺上個誒誒嗰個議程裏邊討論嗰個文件裏邊都提過，即係誒根據翻我哋房委會喺二零一二年嘅公屋輪候冊嗰個嘅誒申請人嘅統計調查咧，喺三十五歲或以下嘅非長者人申請者裏邊咧，大概百分之三十三係個居民嚟嘅。咁但係我都想強調呢。

626
01:54:40,360 --> 01:55:00,370
佢係一個其實係一個調查，就唔係追將佢哋嘅資料咧，係同翻我哋嘅房署記錄做一個比較嘅。咁亦都亦都係確保翻我哋嘅調查咧，係誒一個公正，亦都係唔會話誒因為咁而擔心到，譬如話喺一啲佢哋嘅私隱係受到影響。咁所以呢方面，我哋其實係冇辦法分析到咧。其實呢所謂嘅百分之三十三嘅申請人咧，其實佢哋係來係咪來自？

627
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:05,190
而家嘅公屋嘅誒，即係所謂嘅誒富户嘅家庭啦，定係就係啲非富户家庭咧噉樣？

628
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:25,700
誒，我回應咧就係第二個問題咧，由於你哋冇做出呢個關於三廿三percent高屋居民嗰個來源嘅分析咧，咁變咗咧就係你哋作進一步去研究政策解決嗰啲問題咧，就變咗更加係模糊，更加咧係揾唔到咧解決嘅方。

629
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:33,420
嘅，儘管咧，你而家咧就係唔能夠回答我，但係我咧個人咧仍然希望。

630
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:44,810
當局同埋咧嗰個長策小組咧，就呢個方面咧，係作具體嘅進一步嘅調查研究，進行分析。

631
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:56,940
至於第一個問題咧，秘書長咧就係當然咧再一次拒絕咧，就話唔會再做呢個租置計劃咧，我係表示強烈嘅不滿同埋遺憾。

632
01:55:57,220 --> 01:56:07,760
咁而家時間咧就到呢度咧，剛好咧就將近咧係四點半啦。咁咧就係冇其他事項咧，我哋就係完結今日嘅會議。多謝各位。
