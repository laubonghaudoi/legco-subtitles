9
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,400
咁喺下一次嘅事項，我哋就誒分配咗時間再討論㗎。

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:28,310
咁亦都請委員咧係誒表示係咪同意討論誒上述兩個事項咧，即係誒二零一四年一月份嗰個會嘅。如果大家係同意嘅咧，我都有必要咧要向大家提出咧嗰個會開應該咧就需要開到七點鐘誒，以備。

跟住咧，亦都係誒。

會去到我哋嘅議程嘅第三項啦。

16
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:12,430
咁以前嘅第三項咧就係誒香港律師會而引入統一執業事嘅建議。噉我發畀大家嘅文件咧就有C.B.括弧四二二五足十三-hyphen十四括弧零三，就係香港律師會提交嘅文。

17
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:21,380
文件咁咧就係誒今日先至係誒傳過嚟，我哋係table咗畀大家嘅，係啦，大律師公會。

18
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:41,670
亦都有另外一個係table咗畀大家嘅文件咁咧，就另外一份文件係C B括弧四二三四足十三-hyphen十四括誒括弧零一噉就係香港大學法學院、香港中文大學法學院同埋香港城市大學法學院嘅聯合意見書。

19
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,170
係。

20
00:03:42,450 --> 00:04:02,460
噉我哋都請誒委員咧，可以注意誒，繼香港律師會喺今年嘅十一月下旬發出諮詢文件之後咧，誒，我哋呢個議程嘅項目標題咧，亦都根據佢哋嗰個嘅諮詢文件嘅題目咧，稍作修改。噉啊，基本上咧。

21
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:11,710
都係集中喺香港律師會係誒研究同埋提出咧，是否引入一個統一嘅執業試呢個建議嘅。

22
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:26,370
噉我哋而家咧就可以請啊各個代表咧可以入嚟我哋嘅誒會議廳。噉我哋請誒秘書處誒同我哋邀請嗰個代表係。

23
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:46,890
誒，我申報我係C.T.U嘅學生，但係我暫時停咗呢個學生，因為我問呢個問題，我停咗我學學術研究喺呢方面，因為我唔想人哋話我，因為想讀呢個P.C.L。我冇冇諗住會讀P.C.L，我只係純純粹係興趣去讀呢個法律嘅啫，主席。所以咧，我我。

24
00:04:46,890 --> 00:05:06,900
我我宣佈咗主席先嚇，係廖長江議員。宣佈誒香港大學校務委員會委員葉國軒代阿石阿軒。係，仲有冇邊位委員要宣佈？誒，有冇再嘅council？係，我自己都要宣佈啦。我喺城市大學化學院係誒誒教書嘅任教，咁咧我就。

25
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:26,910
唔係教P.C.L.L嘅噉，但係我咧都係喺誒香港大學誒係P.C.L.L畢業嘅。噉我諗咧就誒，仲有邊位委員有需要申報嘅都可以。咁誒，首先歡迎咁多位代表同埋啊啊兩個誒係大律師公會同埋律師會嘅代表，同埋三大法學院嘅代表。

26
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:39,080

27
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,170
噉我首先咧就誒要向各位代表咧就係誒指出誒。

28
00:05:45,870 --> 00:06:05,880
各位代表喺今日誒，無論係口頭或者書面嘅意見書咧，係唔會係受到立法會權力及特權條例嘅保障嘅。咁由於香港律師會就引入統一執業事係發出咗諮詢文件，咁咧我哋就想咧係誒首。

29
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:25,890
先係想請香港律師會嘅代表發言，咁因為佢哋係文件嘅誒提出者啦，我哋就會畀多少少時間咧，就畀五分鐘律師會嘅代表。其後嘅團體同埋誒大學嘅代表咧，我哋咧就係將會希望每個團體咧都係發言時間係三。

30
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,120
分鐘，然後咧就輪到我哋委員會嘅委員係發問嘅。

31
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,840
咁而家咧，我就首先咧就係請香港律師會嘅代表發言，係請阿葉律師。

32
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:59,370
唔使撳，OK。誒誒，主席誒，請問可唔可以用誒誒容許我用英文作答，因為因為大學啲代表係誒誒外語人士，咁所以可能方便啲。係喺呢度，亦都可以啊，向大家誒誒提出啦。如果大家係誒想用英文或者係中文咧，儘量係用。

33
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:07,730
同一種語言啊，以方便我哋嘅即時傳譯去作出翻譯嘅。咁歡迎你哋用任何嘅語誒，其中一個語言。

34
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,630
係。

35
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:18,500
Madam Chairperson, thank you for inviting the law society to make representations on our proposal to conduct a consultation on the common entrance examination.

36
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,580
我會like at the very outset.

37
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,860
to clarify one important item.

38
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,690
The Law Society is conducting a consultation.

39
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,420
The consultation is about an entrance examination to test the standard of potential solicitors.

40
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,780
It is not to replace the PCCLL, nor have we proposed that it should be replaced.

41
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,290
我 must admit that the paths to becoming a solicitor are complex.

42
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,790
and difficult to understand.

43
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,250
The fact is that, despite us trying on several occasions to be clear about it to the media,

44
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,220
It is unfortunate that what we are proposing has not been fully understood.

45
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:14,940
Indeed, it would appear that the secretariat to this panel might have equally been confused, and hence the original item on the agenda was incorrectly stated as to discuss the law society's proposal to replace the PCLL.

46
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,710
無 doubt， that drew fire from the three law schools.

47
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,010
Let me say here, once again.

48
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,270
律師會並不是提出要取代或廢除PCLL。

49
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,470
The course remains a necessary step and qualification for a large proportion of lawyers entering our profession each year.

50
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:43,180
And it is equally an important step and qualification for lawyers entering our counterpart at the bar.

51
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:54,520
It would be important also to understand that when we say common entrance examination, it is really an entrance examination for the solicitors profession.

52
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,610
and has nothing to do with the entry to the bar.

53
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,880
它不是一個普通律師和 barrister 的入職考試。

54
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,460
although， if the bar wishes to engage in that direction.

55
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,410
We would not close our doors to discussing that.

56
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:18,190
Further, the PCLL course are taught and awarded by Hong Kong U, City U and Chinese U.

57
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:26,880
律師協會沒有意圖幹預三所大學的學術自由，以及他們如何考驗學生。

58
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:39,570
just as the law society expects to have the freedom in determining how it examines the standards of those who wish to become solicitors, and what quality we expect solicitors to have.

59
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,600
Before they can be let loose, so to speak, on serving the public.

60
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,090
Now, with that out of the way, I would like to say that the consultation is currently open.

61
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,510
And we are gathering views from a very diverse group of stakeholders and members of the public.

62
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:05,990
It is therefore premature to talk about whether we should or should not implement the proposal for a common entrance examination.

63
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,930
And it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the papers before the panel from the three law schools or the bar.

64
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:21,350
我會像要邀請那些有建設性 desire 表示他們的觀點，無論支持、反對或有替代性建議。

65
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,550
to do that at an appropriate forum.

66
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,770
當前系統的發明是實施於約40年前，當時只有1所法學學校。

67
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,810
not only have the numbers of local and overseas law graduates increased substantially.

68
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,310
但的Scope和nature of work conducted by solicitors has changed drastically.

69
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:52,330
這些變化，是伴隨著外國律師求取入籍香港，和外國律師行求設立業務的增加。

70
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,770
相關的立法條文，就這個話題，當然係律師執業守則和實習律師規則。

71
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,480
The Law Society feels strongly that, as a regulator for the solicitors profession in Hong Kong,

72
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,260
它有責任和義務。

73
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:19,880
要 ensure that those who are practising as solicitors in Hong Kong have achieved the highest standards and are of the quality that the public expects of us.

74
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,840
它有 duty to ensure solicitors acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the demands of consumers and the community.

75
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,910
And that these skills are constantly updated and maintained at a consistently high standard.

76
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:51,050
However, unlike our counterparts in the vast majority of other jurisdictions, the law society is not currently exercising its statutory power to administer the actual testing mechanism on that standard and quality for the large proportion of those entering this profession.

77
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,450
The PCLL accounts for a large proportion of those who become solicitors.

78
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:05,200
我係，我

79
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,230
The law society feels.

80
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,530
That there could very well be inconsistencies.

81
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,130
在標準的入職到訴訟專業，因為不同的入職途徑。

82
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:33,200
Even for P.C.L.L. itself, there is no certainty of consistency in standards. And I say this because, respecting their academic freedom, each of the three law schools has its own criteria for admitting P.C.L.L. students, develop its own law schools.

83
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,970
develop his own curriculum, conducts his own course, and examines his own students subject to a set of benchmarks.

84
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,300
laid down by the law society.

85
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,240
Madam Chair, I will only take another 30 seconds.

86
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:54,160
律師公會已經收到來自外部考官、實務人士和學生的反饋，指出有不一致的地方。

87
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,640
and it is felt that it is time that we should carefully look at what should be done and what could be done.

88
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:16,490
There is also the issue of the bottleneck. I mean, there is a bottleneck, but I would be happy to address that at another occasion. In closing, I would say that contrary to what was alluded to.

89
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:22,740
律師協會不願為數目的緣故而限制入行。

90
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:32,450
by creating any artificial barrier to entry, however, it wishes to allow entrance to the profession to those who achieve the same.

91
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,040
consistent high standard that you and I.

92
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,380
和其他 members of the public expects of solicitors in Hong Kong.

93
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:51,890
Thank you。係多謝啊葉律師，咁咧就誒跟住落嚟咧就係誒係請香港大律師工會嘅代表陳敬生先生。

94
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,610
嗯好。

95
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,480
主席。

96
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:17,030
麥克風working， I suppose it is. Now the position of the bar is really set out in the proposed common entrance examination paper, which I think has been placed before every member here. And given the time constraint, I'm not going to go through it. But there are really a few things that I like to emphasise. One is

97
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:24,020
said, of course, we realise that this proposed common entrance examination is meant for the solicitors' profession only.

98
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:35,500
但這 certainly may impact on the bar in two ways. One is of course that if the entrance to the solicitors profession has proven to be too difficult.

99
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:51,070
And have proven to be too harsh for the student, then of course there would be the temptation for those who actually doesn't want to join the bar, who nevertheless would like to join the bar first and hoping to switch to solicitors later on.

100
00:14:51,350 --> 00:15:05,270
Now, if that is the position, obviously it is very unhealthy. So we have got an interest to see that the students, there is no unnecessary barrier put on to the students from becoming solicitors.

101
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:25,560
Now I'm not really saying this just as a matter of empty talk or as a matter of theory. It did occur in the past that on on a few years where the economy was bad and it was very difficult to get traineeship, the number of students joining the bar has got a sudden increase.

102
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:34,760
Because there was no impediment from joining the bar, you don't have to be a trainee solicitor or trainee barristers and got paid.

103
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:52,160
所以呢個係某啲嘢，我們有興趣。而家另一個係，當然係呢個建議對大學嘅願望，繼續投資於學生嘅教育，喺BCL課程。

104
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:12,450
我剛才聽過，它不是要取代PCOL，但另一方面，不清楚的是，它是否只是打算讓PCOL成為完全可選的實踐，意思是説，這是一個你可以選擇PCOL或不。

105
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,360
no course at all and simply pass the common entrance examination. Now, if that be the case, then of course.

106
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:39,980
The PCOL is no longer a mandatory course, and of course the number of support or of students supporting such course would be reduced, and the university desire and the investment on the course would likewise be reduced. Now these are very practical matters that we have all.

107
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,010
got to think about very carefully.

108
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:52,820
The idea of having self-regulations to the entrance to the profession is obviously a noble one, but of course here we're talking about public interest.

109
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,600
and we have to.

110
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,490
We have to be careful that this can.

111
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:07,020
That this kind of examination is not seen by the public to be a kind of number control exercised.

112
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:14,960
O.K. 多謝阿陳景新先生。咁跟住咧，我哋就請香港大學法學院陳文敏教授院長。

113
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:32,660
主席，委，法大法學院已提交聯合提交，我們已與秘書處討論過，最好我們分九分鐘，由法學院分享，我會講得長些，然後由另外兩個法學院補充。

114
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:51,240
The first point we want to make is that we are glad to hear from the Law Society that they assure that this common exam is not to replace the PCCL, but it's still unclear when this common exam is going to be held and whether it would have the impact of rendering the PCCL redundant.

115
00:17:51,520 --> 00:18:11,530
作為我們在聯合文件中所説的，PCL是一個技能基於的密集課程，一年。它是密集的訓練，其中大部分的課程是在小組中進行實踐，小組的意思是約有10名學生。他們經過密集的實踐訓練，交易和交易。

116
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,800
with also extensive involvement of the profession and the judiciary.

117
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:33,840
The PCL programmes are also closely monitored by the professional bodies, and the details have been set out in our paper. It has evolved over the years to reach this point, and this system has served us well. We are not aware of any major criticism of the quality of the programme.

118
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:42,580
Having said that, there could always be improvement, and all three law schools are open to suggestions for improvements as we have always done.

119
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:52,640
The professional bodies have set the benchmarks, and we work towards those benchmarks. There's a common set of skills that all PCIL graduates would and should acquire.

120
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:12,140
At the same time, there is more than a way to achieve the same thing, and legal training has to be flexible rather than dogmatic. And a slightly different programme in all three law schools with a common core actually strengthened and enriched the quality of the programme.

121
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:24,900
The free law school have also been able to offer different electives and to produce graduates with different strength and interests. Hence, the short point here is diversity is a strength rather than a weakness.

122
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:36,010
And introducing a common entrance examination is a major change to the current system, and we are not convinced that there are justification to make such a major change.

123
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:54,190
We reckon that there is keen competition for PCCL plays, and we like to emphasise firstly is there is no quota in any of the free law school as to the PCCL admissions. Admission is and has always been by merits, and the benchmark is set by the professional bodies.

124
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:12,630
在過去兩年，有約650個PCCL位子由三所法學堂合併提供，有約1,300個申請人每年在過去兩年，我們説這個50%的錄取率是可比的，如果不是比其他司法管轄區更好的話。

125
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:25,060
和第二，The number is not fixed in stones. All PCCL providers are prepared to consider expanding the number of emissions if necessary, subject to quality and resources.

126
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:39,720
However, unless we are prepared to go for a system that whoever reads law shall be able to be admitted, a line has to be drawn somewhere, and wherever we draw the line, there will always be people immediately below the bar.

127
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:51,280
at the same time as the law society rightly said, it is in the public interest to maintain a high quality of lawyers who, after all, form the backbone of the rule of law in Hong Kong.

128
00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:11,620
第三ly， is we understand the concern that it may be difficult for someone to get admitted to PCCL on a second attempt for no reason other than keen competition. We are prepared to consider ways to alleviate this concern. For example, Hong Kong U is prepared to set aside some places for this group of applicants.

129
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:21,550
Who just missed the threshold marginally by taking into account other factors such as work experience? Chinese University and CityU are also looking into these issues.

130
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:39,120
然而，我們的經驗顯示，數量合格候選人中，被排除在外的，僅僅是少數。絕大多數無法被錄取的候選人，只是因為他們不符合專業的標準。

131
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:56,400
On the other hand, a common entrance exam will make entry to the legal profession even more restrictive. It will not result in better lawyers, as an examination is no substitute for the current year-long systematic training with continuous feedback and improvements.

132
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:05,650
The practical and systematic skills training in the PCRL course is not something that one can acquire easily by self-studies.

133
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:25,940
No doubt, there will be commercial providers who will come into the scene. But if it is difficult to monitor the current three tertiary institutions who are expert in education, how could one monitor a wider number of commercial providers with varying quality? And at the end, one will have to rely on the examinations.

134
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:45,950
which will not produce better lawyers, let alone the affordability of such private, commercially oriented programmes. It is also unclear when this common entrance exam is to take place. If it is to take place immediate after the PCCL, what could it add to the current PCCL? If it is to take place

135
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:57,930
Later, the benchmark has to be set out clearly, and what is expected has to be set out clearly. And it should not serve just adding another barrier to the entry to the legal profession.

136
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:09,580
In short, we do not see any justification for introducing a common entrance exam. If there were any concerns about the current PCAL programme, this could have been resolved within the current system.

137
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:29,890
Furthermore, the Standing Committee on Legal Education is conducting a comprehensive review of legal education and training, including the traineeship stage of the solicitors. It would be most undesirable to introduce any change to pre-empt the review by the Standing Committee. So that's the joint positions of the free law schools.

138
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:42,960
And maybe my colleagues from Chinese University could add to the submissions. Thank you, Chairman.係多謝陳文敏教授。誒，請問其他兩個法學院有冇補充？Mr. Chris Crystal Fergin。

139
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,970
Professor林鳳，any additional remarks?

140
00:23:49,790 --> 00:24:09,800
非常感謝主席。只有很少幾點要補充教授Chal説的，因為正如他所解釋的，法律學係在一般性上對大多數問題達成共識，我們目前所理解的。我認為我們現在面臨的困難是，不清楚法律學會是否會。

141
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:29,810
是關於質素，即係已經提供嘅，喺學術階段同專業培訓之間嘅橋樑。如果係質素嘅問題，噉就有機制去解決。我認為好重要嘅係提醒大家，我哋嘅PCLL計劃喺質素方面運作。

142
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:43,060
保證機制，是大學們適用於所有學術課程的，而且當然也受到法律界監察。

143
00:24:43,370 --> 00:25:03,380
如果係一個問題，數字，我們聽到瓶頸，那麼有幾多重要問題要考慮？首先，我們需要多少受訓者？

144
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:23,390
If we remove the so-called bottleneck, then we will be simply displacing the issue, because there is every risk that we will have a lot of young people who have gone through their law degree and other forms of training, and still can't.

145
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:37,600
get access to professional practice. I think the question of the bottleneck is is one which really depends at what stage you decide to impose some control over access to the profession.

146
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:58,200
And I think finally we can't ignore the question of cost. If there is to be an expansion in the number of PCCL graduates, then that is a cost that has to be met. At the moment, the majority of PCCL candidates in Hong Kong are UGC funded. Although the distribution of

147
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,230
UGC funded places is differs across the three law schools.

148
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:23,450
And if there is not to be an increase in UGC funding, then we are faced with the prospect of expanding self-financed numbers at precisely the time that the universities are being very closely monitored because of their self-financed numbers. So there are a number of difficulties that face us all here.

149
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,810
好，嗯。

150
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:43,500
誒城市大學誒處理院長林峯教授。Thank you, Chair. I just want to emphasise one point, that is the introduction of the common entrance exam proposed by the Law Society is a fundamental change to the current system.

151
00:26:43,780 --> 00:27:03,790
and it deserves careful and serious consideration. So far, the only justification we've just heard is to ensure the consistency in standard. And I think the justifications need to be well articulated. And whether that only justification is enough is, I believe, still very.

152
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,770
爭議性。

153
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:15,130
and also the consensus building process is very important before the introduction is of the CE is actually brought.

154
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:35,420
and currently the standing committee on legal education, as Professor Chan has mentioned, is going to conduct comprehensive review. I think that will be the proper channel and for to build the consensus because all the stakeholders are represented on that committee. Thank you, Chair. 好，多謝。

155
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,460
誒，跟住咧，我哋係請律政司黃慶康專員。

156
00:27:41,510 --> 00:28:01,520
多謝主席。誒，關於今次討論啊，律師會提出嘅C.E.嗰個制度咧，我哋喺現階段係未有一個即係定案喺度。我哋都係抱住一個開放嘅心態，睇睇誒各個持份者佢哋嘅觀點係點樣。但係我哋特別想強調咧，因為目前法律教育及培訓常設委員會咧。

157
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:21,530
亦都未有機會去討論有關嘅課題，咁所以呢個咁關鍵嘅議題，其實我哋覺得呢個委員會係一個相當適合嘅平台去討論，因為入邊包括持份者係有司法機構嘅，有法官啦，有誒律師會、大律師會，亦都有啊三個誒法律學院嘅代表，同埋亦都有即係。

158
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:41,540
我哋叫lay person，即係社會嘅人士喺當中，同埋我哋律政司同埋呢個教育局嘅。咁所以，我哋好希望係透過呢個平台，能夠有效地將大家唔同嘅意見能夠係整合，以致揾一個最適合香港嘅發展，能夠對香港法律教育同埋培訓係做到最好，以致我哋能夠面向二十一世紀。

159
00:28:41,540 --> 00:29:01,550
嗰個法律嘅嘅需要同埋挑戰，多謝主席。係多謝阿黃專員嗱。咁咧就誒好多謝咁多誒位代表咧，已經係對誒有關嘅議題表達咗一啲基本嘅意見。而家嘅時間咧就係畀各位委員發問嘅。咁為咗有效啲去誒處理個時間，我想。

160
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:11,740
大家係有有興趣問問題嘅委員，可唔可以示意？暫時我有兩位委員舉咗手嘅，仲有邊幾位委員係有興趣發言？

161
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,820
借位住。

162
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,010
仲有冇？

163
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,610
嗱，越係。

164
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:40,290
O.K.嗱，咁暫時咧，我哋係有四位委員誒發言咧。噉我就會畀每一位委員係四分鐘。咁隨住係廖長江議員嗱，隨住如果越嚟越多委員佢係有有啊發言嗰個誒興趣咧，我哋就會縮短翻個時間同埋。咁而家咧。

165
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,880
先請誒陳鑑林議員。

166
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,420
都係主席。

167
00:29:44,730 --> 00:30:04,740
主席，我自己就唔係律師，不過我覺得咧呢個問題喺誒律師界嘅朋友裏邊咧都經常有討論到嘅。誒，剛才咧就阿葉前會長咧就誒講咗啦，噉啊，然後有其他啲朋友咧都提咗啲意見，但係就阿葉會長未有機會回應，但係我都想問。

168
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:24,750
幾個問題，即係希望你都可以解説一下。誒，你你就提到咧，就誒，即係呢個公開嘅考試咧，即係C.E.E.咧，並唔係想取代嗰個P.C.L.L.啊。咁但係你將來係點樣去運作？因為大家都誒擔心到咧，將來嗰個水。

169
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:44,760
水準個問題，譬如有一啲嘅學生，佢準備去考呢個C.E.E.，但係佢又唔喺香港讀呢三間大學，或者係誒唔喺英國嗰幾間大學裏邊讀嘅，咁點樣去set一個水平咧？大家係可以放心嘅咧？咁咁呢個一個第二個問題咧，就係。

170
00:30:44,760 --> 00:31:04,770
誒，你哋提出呢個建議係唔係覺得現時三間大學香港嘅啲三間大學嗰個學位唔夠？誒呢個培育足夠嘅呢個誒大學嘅即係呢個法律係嘅學生出嚟咁誒係咪問題喺呢度咧？抑或係？

171
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,470
其中涉及到譬如話誒利益嘅問題啊，因為剛才咧。

172
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:25,100
誒，陳景生先生都有講咧，佢話：如果你有一個公開嘅考試嘅話咧，就會造成而家嘅啲學院裏邊咧就冇呢一種嘅吸引力咧，或者係冇噉嘅能力咧，就係去繼續。

173
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,920
去舉辦呢一類PCLL嘅誒課程，咁實際嘅問題係點嘅樣咧？可唔可以解答一下？

174
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:43,600
後邊一位阿阿葉律師先，誒誒，不如等我嘗試一下回答啊，陳議員嘅問題。噉就陳議員中用陳議員用中文問我，所以我儘量用中文嚟回答。

175
00:31:43,930 --> 00:32:03,260
啊！多謝陳議員。咁咧就第一，你個問題就係誒呢一個誒，即係P C L L嗰個誒嗰個標準嗰個點樣去釐定啊？同埋我哋如果係C E嘅話，呢一個標準係點樣釐定啊？第一咧就係誒，我諗要要請誒要解釋一下嘅，就係而家其實咧係有。

176
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,720
誒有律師咧，係成為咗香港嘅事務律師，係唔需要讀P.C.L.嘅。

177
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:26,010
有部分嘅誒律師咧，佢哋係經過呢個我哋所謂叫做外國誒，即係O L Q E Office誒Lawyers Qualification Examination誒嚟去誒考入嚟就做咗香港律師嘅。咁所以係有一部分嘅律師係根本唔需要考P C O L嘅。

178
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:46,300
但係咧，而家絕大部分嘅入行嘅律師咧，都係經過呢一個P.C.L.L考試。就算佢哋喺外國讀完咗法律嘅誒嘅嘅課程咧，佢哋翻到嚟香港咧，都係要讀完P.C.L.L考完P.C.L.L嗰個試，先至去做我哋所謂嗰個誒見習律師嗰。

179
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,860
嗰個嗰兩年嘅執律師嗰個誒誒合同嘅。

180
00:32:50,290 --> 00:33:10,300
咁誒，我哋而家做一個諮詢咧，其實即係諮詢嘅本質就係其實我哋知道希望得到唔同嘅意見，令到我哋將我哋嗰個啊提議更加優化嘅。咁所以而家你你問我話有我哋個計劃係會點做，同埋點樣定個啲標準嘅話？

181
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:30,310
我暫時答唔到你嘅。我希望就係可以喺我哋有呢一個諮詢嗰個成果之後咧，就再繼續可以有機會同你去即係繼續去研究呢個問題。但係誒總括嚟講咧，喺個標準嗰度嚟嚟嚟講嘅話，我哋只係希望一個統一嘅標準，同埋就係即係。

182
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:36,090
即係令到所有嘅嘅學生都係有同一個機會去考同一個試。

183
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,920
嚟誒，爭奪依一個標準嗰個嗰個出發點嘅啫。

184
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:50,400
咁第二個問題就係話，而家係咪只係因為誒大學嗰個學位唔夠，所以我哋要做呢樣嘢咧？唔係嘅，但誒。

185
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:57,270
老實講，呢一個師資嘅考試係咪可以解決到學位嘅問題，其實都未知。

186
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:10,840
而只不過係我哋初步嘅構思嚟講，呢個可能係一個啊方案咧，係可以解，可能可以解決到有幾個唔同嘅擔心嘅嘅地方。其中一個可能係學位嘅問題。

187
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,120
好，誒，跟住咧就係啊，郭榮亨議員。

188
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:37,410
多謝主席。主席，我有幾點係希望律師會嘅代表可以澄清一下嗱。你誒頭先都開宗明義講咧，就話呢個誒C.E咧就係唔係要嚟取代P.C.L.L.嘅，講咗幾次噉，所以其實而家P.C.L.L.學位不足嘅問題咧係唔會得以解決嘅，因為。

189
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:57,420
係啊，始終嗰個嘅樽頸位咧，仍然會係存在。就係如果P.C.L.L.仍然係唔夠嘅，咁誒嗰啲讀完法律學位嗰啲人咧，始終都係入唔到行嘅。咁所以呢個誒P.C.L.L.學位是否足夠嘅問題咧，我陣間亦都會花少少時間問三位大學。

190
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:17,430
係，我想講嘅就係依一點。咁其實律師會啊嗱，如果你話擔心而家P.C.L.L.嗰個質素係誒唔足以誒誒去控制嗰個入行律師嘅人嘅質素呢？咁其實你哋律師會同三間大學不嬲都有好緊密嘅聯繫，係就住P.C.L.

191
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:37,440
嘅教材啦，誒考試模式啦，同埋嗰個監考嘅活動咧，你哋其實都好密切嘅。咁其實你哋可以就住呢啲渠道咧，去提升就同三間大學講喂，你提升個質素唔該，因為啊，我認為而家嘅質素唔夠。咁點解你哋唔採取呢個誒嘅方式咧？點解要考慮？

192
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,020
去去做一個司醫咧，同埋咧。

193
00:35:40,300 --> 00:36:00,310
誒，我想問問就係，即係其實你哋喺考慮成個法律界嗰個嘅培訓嘅時候，希望亦都會考慮埋大律師公會嗰個嘅嘅睇法，因為當然你依個司義係講緊淨係執業律師嘅一個資格，但係其實大律師公會佢哋都講明啦，就係佢哋係希望繼續誒用翻而家嗰。

194
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:20,320
P.C.L.O.嘅渠道去訓練律師，咁所以其實兩個誒誒法律嗰個專業嘅行業咧，大律師又好，事務律師又好咧，其實佢哋應該希望都係用同一個制度係可以誒誒訓練出嚟嘅，因為好似我自己噉，我自己係由誒事務。

195
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:40,330
務律師轉去大律師嘅，有啲朋友係由大律師轉翻做事務律師，咁所以某程度上啊兩方面嗰個嘅訓練咧，都必須要有一個啊劃一嘅啊啊啊一個嘅考試同埋一個嘅誒培訓咯，嚇咁所以依方面係重要嘅。咁到最後咧，其實誒喺你答我問題之前咧。

196
00:36:40,330 --> 00:37:00,340
我希望律師會咧，因為頭先阿阿阿葉律師佢亦都有講到，就係有一啲律師而家係透過外國嗰個OLQE考試，誒誒得到香港嘅律師資格。因為你而家講緊CE咧，亦都會影響到呢啲OLQE考試嗰個嘅程度。咁所以我想律師會咧係向我哋本會咧提交。

197
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:20,350
交一啲數據，咁嗰啲數據係咩咧？就係O L Q E每一年有幾多人投考，有幾多人咧係申請下面exemption。而嗰五個如果有五，如果我冇記錯，應該係有五個head of啊paper嘅，即係有五種啊考卷要做嘅。咁喺就住每一個嘅啊。

198
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:40,360
啊，範疇有幾多人申請過啊？呢個啊，客面有幾多人獲得客面，同埋就住每一個範疇有幾多人係攞到一個自動嘅客面，即係automatic exemption。我希望律師會咧可以畀一套數據我哋，咁或者我畀誒誒律師會嘅代表答一答我頭先嘅三個問題先。好，葉律師。

199
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,480
多謝主席。誒，我諗第一件事就係誒，我將我調轉嚟答啦。嗯。

200
00:37:47,150 --> 00:38:07,160
sorry，個議員係咪有有要補？我唔係，排第二輪啦。你繼續答。唔該，我調轉嚟答啦。第一就係誒呢個O L Q E嘅數據誒，好對唔住，我暫時冇呢個數據係實。你你遲啲用書面補翻，我哋書面補翻畀你嚇。第二咧就係誒你第二條問題咧，就係問係咪即係而家我哋覺得質素不？

201
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:27,170
不足個問題係我諗，首先要講好清楚嘅就係我哋而家冇覺得我哋而家入行嘅嘅新入行，尤其是新入行嘅律師朋友嘅嘅質素係不足嘅。嚇，我哋冇講過呢個問題，而係咧，我哋只不過係講緊我哋嗰個誒誒入行嘅考試嗰個誒有。

202
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:40,170
個即係有三間分開考試嘅大學，佢哋有自己教嘅誒教嘅嘅課程，誒考嘅考生都係佢哋自己考，而唔係我哋嗰個行業裏邊去統一一個考試嘅啫。

203
00:38:40,580 --> 00:39:00,590
噉我你嗰個樽頸嗰個問題咧，樽頸嘅問題點樣解決？點解呢件事可能可以解決嗱？我唔係話呢一個係一個啊，C.E係一個啊一個解決嘅方法，只不過係咧喺同時嚟講，如果你話有樽頸問題，樽頸問題解決嘅方法，當然其中一個方法就係畀多啲學位出嚟啦。

204
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:15,990
咁如果你畀多啲學位嘅話，可能喺啲大學畀多啲學位，或者你可以引入多啲嘅啊誒教PCL嘅嘅嘅誒嘅提供者。咁但係當然教PCL提供者要引入多啲嘅話，係需要改法例嘅。

205
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:36,340
誒喺我哋而家嘅現行嘅機制咧，誒律師會咧係去誒係去有監察到每一間大學教嘅B C L L嘅課程嘅。但係咧好多時咧，我哋而家係唔夠人咧，係去睇開三間大學三個唔同嘅課程，教三個唔同。

206
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,270
嘅科目嘅。

207
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:45,780
啊！你要知道，就係四十年前，我哋開始嗰陣時，係得一間大學係做PCLL誒誒提供呢個PCLL嘅課程。

208
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:56,050
喺誒三間大學嘅誒嘅誒，佢哋提供嘅資料裏邊咧，亦都有講到就係話誒，比方説我哋可以唔

209
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:16,850
即係如果我哋誒係多啲學位嘅話，誒律師會係唔夠資源去充分噉樣去啊監察呢個科目嘅。咁呢樣嘢係真嘅，因為而家我哋已經係發覺到一個地步咧，就係如果你多啲學位多啲誒提供P.C.L.L課程嘅地方咧，我哋係冇噉樣嘅能力去做。

210
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,870
美國。

211
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:38,180
舉咗個例子，就係有三百幾間嘅大學，佢哋誒亦都係揀一個唔係每年去監察，而係揀幾年去即係分期噉樣去去監察嘅嘅做法。呢樣嘢其實唔係唔得㗎。誒，即係如果我我我覺得大學係有噉樣嘅提議，亦都係好事。不過我亦都要。

212
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:58,190
提出嘅咧就係喺美國，我哋嘅同業裏邊咧，佢哋有我哋多好多嘅會員去做呢件事，同埋咧就係雖然三百幾間誒法律學院，但到最終每一個州都係有佢哋自己，唔係法律學唔係法律學院去管理嘅司法考試嘅。好。

213
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:16,350
阿葉律師，嗱，因為我暫時睇到咧，我哋仲可以許可有呢個鬆動，但係咧陣間就即係希望大家咧盡量係問答咧嗰個時間咧揸翻緊啲。咁暫時咧我仲係有仲有三位嘅同事排緊隊嘅啫嚇，謝偉全議員。

214
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:35,110
誒，即係我本身就唔係律師啊。不過我理解啫，香港好多專業嘅資格都係一啲學會，佢有呢個即係考試嘅，就係通過學會考試咧，佢可以正式成為誒某個專業，可以執業啦。

215
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:55,400
噉啊，其實我都想問問咧，就係香港律師會代表啦。當然我理解咧，而家咧即係大學去培訓律師啊，通過呢個PCLL，其實已經行資一段時間㗎啦。咁點解而家突然間即係會想整多個另外一個CE嘅？

216
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:15,410
市咧係咪主要因為嗰個學位唔夠咧啊？如果學位唔夠，係咪應該從學位方面嗰個着手啊？抑或有其他咧？因為我理解，頭先聽咧，第一就唔係質素嘅問題啦。第二，誒其實有關專業團體咧，就亦都同大學方面咧，就。

217
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:35,420
有好好溝通啊，對嗰個要求啊，或者課程啊等等噉，所以我就希望咧就係誒律師會嘅代表可唔可以再講講，因為我係發覺有少少誒唔係太理解點解會有誒提議另外個試啊。雖然我理解其他專業學會咧都係自己考。

218
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,920
誒定個試係考自己嗰個專業嗰啲人嘅執執業資格嘅，唔該主席。

219
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,550
係。

220
00:42:43,050 --> 00:43:03,060
律師會嘅代表，主席唔該，誒多謝謝議，就誒其實誒你講得係啱嘅，即係點解係以前好似誒都係行之有效，點解而家我哋又提出呢啲噉嘅問題？第一就係行之有效並不表示我哋唔可以做得更好，我覺得我哋為咗公眾。

221
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:23,070
嘅利益著想，誒律師會覺得係需要咁做。咁但係咧就誒，亦都要講一講，就係我哋咁多年嚟咧，本來有一間法律學院，而家已經係有三間，誒亦都多咗好多唔同入行嘅方法。以前嘅學生全部都係讀所謂個法律嗰個誒學士嘅課程。

222
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:32,530
LLB而家咧亦都多咗另外一種入誒即係讀嘅方法，就係個佢哋所謂JD個Jewes Doctor嗰個嗰個嗰個課程。

223
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:49,430
啊！我哋律師做嘅誒工作咧個工種咧喺呢幾十年來咧亦都轉得好多嚇，而家亦都有多咗唔同嘅競爭，誒亦都有啲外國好多咗好多外國嘅律師嚟香港，亦都多咗好多律外國嘅律師行嚟香港。

224
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:58,490
誒，我哋學生嘅數目亦都多咗好多，咁所以誒，係咪應該要重新再睇一睇？就係而家係我哋提出嗰個原因。

225
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:19,980
誒咁咧就，我諗會跟進啊，即係係咪即係話意思，即係而家嗰個大學學位嗰度係唔夠咧？係咪佢哋嘅意見就係應該即係增加？係有冇跟進補充？葉律師誒誒，大學學位唔夠誒，當然係可以增加啦。咁其實之前亦都有人問過，就係話即係唔係將。

226
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:39,990
誒將大學學位加咗大學學學位之後，將嗰個誒呢個樽頸位置變咗去喺個行業裏邊。咁誒，我唔唔排除有呢個可能，我唔排除呢個可能。點解咧？就係但係，如果就算呢個可能發生嘅話，個樽頸係因為一個公眾嘅需求。

227
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:46,940
嘅問題，而唔係因為一間大學或者兩間大學或者三間大學控制嘅問題。

228
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,920
好誒，跟住咧就係石禮謙議員。

229
00:44:51,520 --> 00:45:04,910
Madam President, Madam Chairman, I just like to share with the members here, visitors here, some statistics provided by the Government of Hong Kong Education Bureau.

230
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:10,580
在年間，Between two hundred and one and two hundred and two。

231
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:18,250
The mission to PCL programme, a mission to PCL programme, of which.

232
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:24,630
Professor Chan was right. It's about forty-eight percent against the total application.

233
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:32,810
但這44%不告訴你整個故事，係所有統計數字，是謊言。謊言，謊言，是點樣用？

234
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,670
Okay, so of the forty-four percent that have been admitted.

235
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,680
only from Hong Kong.

236
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:48,340
學生申請基於本地法規資格，四十四%。

237
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:58,310
In respect of students with application based on non-local law graduations, it's also 43%. So basically.

238
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:14,970
你講緊about bottleneck，你你其實，the universities have created a openness in accepting students， particular JDS and all the other students， encourage them to do law。

239
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,790
但係， at the end of the day， with same amount of money given for different position by UGC。

240
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:30,860
You have admitted 43% of Hong Kong student from non-local. That signifies two aspect. First is you.

241
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,170
你有考慮過，The Overseas Graduates are better than Hong Kong Graduates.

242
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:57,460
That's one of deduction you can make. So why you admit so many students? Is it because of greed for the power of money that you encourage people to spend two years, three years to pursue a law degree and you flung them out at last minute? Is the university with aim of education provide?

243
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,790
教育。

244
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,720
and at the same time provide people for Hong Kong.

245
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:23,140
Now you have admitted them and they graduated. Where not everybody have a first degree, a second honour high. You have actually debarred them from. You are there for education. You are not there as a filter for the professional exam for the professional bodies like the.

246
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:31,660
巴和社會，and I must congratulate the law society for taking the greed out and look into this whole problem.

247
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:51,950
of qualification. My first question is to sit you, why your last dean supported this concept of consultation on the CEE? Why the sudden new dean have actually fall into line with the three universities? Why the three univers need to get together? You are not operating same system of

248
00:47:51,950 --> 00:48:11,960
training， you're not operating same type of programme， because is it because of money that you want to protect your own self， the system， you are depriving depriving thousands and thousands of students over the year， you talk about public interest， what kind of public interest are you， on one hand to train them and on

249
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:29,370
另一方面，要懶得要死，要他們加入這個行業，理所當然。律師會在最後兩段，如果我讀一下最後兩段，其實很有趣，你保護你的專業，第十四段。

250
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:49,660
但係，即使增加在地方，都總會有某人會錯過門檻線。想，你係成功了。想下那些想成功卻被拒之門外的人。再者，隨著加入律師行業的人數增加，而超過了行業能吸收的人數。

251
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:57,400
There will be a bottleneck somewhere in life. There's always a bottleneck. It would be a greater waste of resources if someone.

252
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:17,800
is to have taken and passed the qualifying examination and only to find that he is not able to secure pupilage or a trainee contract. Who are you to decide? Let a common examination for them to decide whether they can do it or not. At least then they can at least have this fairness. In Hong Kong nowadays, this society is talk about

253
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:37,810
Equity. It's no longer talk about who you decide to join and you you don't want to join. In your next paragraph, in reality, for those who are really dedicated to join the legal profession in Hong Kong, but are met with such misfortune of not being able to join the PCLL, all is not lost.

254
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:57,820
他可以仍然在其他地方獲取資格，然後後來獲得入學資格到法律專業。這裡，via the OLQE或BQE，和所以和所以。你 realise that a lot of those students borrow money to study the JJD to study the LLB part time. They don't have the time, nor do they have the means to go through to have the luxury.

255
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:17,830
That you are looking from head to head, not that's really no. Let's have a heart for our our younger generation. We while we are meeting a lot of foreign lawyers, we are denying a lot of local trained qualified to be lawyers without the profession. This is exactly what the law society is trying to amend.

256
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:37,890
This is exactly the law society is trying to give those people a chance. They didn't say that they're not going to have PCLL. They didn't say that they're going to replace PCL. Exactly, if you look into the law society document, which I doubt whether you people have read or not, they are just proposing a method of equity.

257
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:58,060
of fairness and giving the young people of Hong Kong a chance. I thought this university was supposed to train young people. Yes, you have trained them, but you have denied them. It's not. It's by merit that you have taken into the. Please don't shake your head. I'm just expressing my view. I thought professionals are all.

258
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:18,070
open-minded， I'm not a professional, I'm not academic, but I might be wrong. But at least I'm expressing my my my my opinion. 好，謝宇軒，我諗時間已經夠。誒，如果大家唔介意咧，誒，因為咧，誒，我會將因為三間法學院誒一定有時間整體回應，因為佢就誒，我希望。

259
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:26,850
咧畀其他幾位委員都發表咗意見，你哋可以整體回應，一定每一個法學院都有機會回應。跟住咧就係阿廖長江議員。

260
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,810
多謝，馬恩主席。

261
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,020
The I find the presentations today somewhat disappointing.

262
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:42,090
我唔見到任何嘅進展，從公眾利益嘅角度睇。

263
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:49,160
但 sound more suspiciously like vested interest masquerading under the guise of public interest.

264
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:55,410
Now, Professor Chan and Professor Lin of Hong Kong University and City University.

265
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:06,400
mention this proposed comprehensive review of legal education training by the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training.

266
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:13,780
now that could be the right way forward because I certainly will not because I was considering.

267
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:22,300
Seriously, the proposal advanced by the law society. But until I heard about this proposed comprehensive review.

268
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,370
That could be the right way forward.

269
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,800
但那 comprehensivе review proposal has been on the table for some time.

270
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,730
and so far I have not seen any progress on that, so.

271
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:57,430
我會 hate to see any unnecessary impediments to be put in the path of that comprehensive review. Now, since that all the most of the stakeholders here would have representatives on the standing committee, I was wondering whether someone can provide me with the information.

272
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:17,440
regarding the timetable, or whether there's any target dates for that comprehensive review to be conducted by the standing committee, will be completed. Thank you。好，啊，幾位關於法律教育上次委員會嘅時間表做呢一個嘅啊檢討，邊一位係啊陳文敏。

273
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:37,450
教授，啊，the standing committee has met and in this reasons meeting, the standing committee one, the standing committee decide to launch this review. Second, the standing committee has already agree on the terms of reference of this committee. Thirdly, the standing committee has preliminary discussions about the consultation.

274
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:50,310
And the compositions of the review panel. The standing committee is looking into the financing of these of the review, and this is the matter to be discussed in the next standing committee meeting, which will be held later this week.

275
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,730
好，仲有冇其他幾位？

276
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,800
李長江議員，你仲有時間？

277
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,290
係。

278
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:16,580
sorry，我想問一問時間表（time table and target date）。係廖議員都係想追問咧，喺嗰個法律教育常設委員會做誒檢討嘅時間表。佢話即係各位嘅法學院都有代表喺嗰個委員會嘅，想追問時間表係點？係陳敬新。

279
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,310
assistant

280
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:28,940
I think actually, so far as the Standing Committee on Legalisation and Manpower is concerned, the greatest impediment at the moment is finance. The reason being that

281
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:49,230
as I understand, as a member there, there is not going to be any government funding for the study, and therefore that committee is looking for certain funding. At the moment, they are looking for the fundings from the Conversion Examination Board, but whether they could be successful in

282
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,930
所做是個問題， which has not yet been decided. 好嘅，Professor Christopher King。

283
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:16,590
我

284
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,240
for considering the best way to to look at these issues.

285
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,090
係。

286
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,400
好，跟住咧就係阿何俊仁議員。

287
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,060
都係主席，啊！我都係誒。

288
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:36,370
法律界執業嘅嘅人士啦，噉我就講我少少嘅睇法咧，就係誒，我記得。

289
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:49,910
好多年前啦嚇，唔記得幾多年前啦，可能二三十年前啦。當時香港係好即係嗰個誒入行嗰誒進入去法律行業執業咧嘅渠道幾多嘅？

290
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,270
就誒可以係誒。

291
00:55:53,550 --> 00:56:13,560
讀大學嚇，本地或者英聯邦嘅大學，咁然後咧就係跟住就考試啦嚇，即係翻翻嚟咁誒，多數都喺外國。如果英國噉，可能係誒即係考part two啊，考上part one part two咁啫。咁其實實際上高，我都睇得到咧，係誒當然有好多好誒成功、好著名嘅。

292
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:20,390
嘅誒執業嘅大律師，或者甚至後來做咗法官咧，甚至有啲可能都冇法律學位嘅，佢只係考bar exam。

293
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,910
根本出嚟嘅係非常之成功嘅。

294
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:43,940
咁但係當然都有唔當然亦都有唔少係名大學翻嚟啦。咁後嚟大家知道出咗香港大學之後咧，咁法律嗰個誒專業嘅誒誒得到學法律學位嘅人數多啦。咁後嚟個社會就個聲音就覺得咧，我哋應該要提高個質素，於是乎就規定要有法學位，然後先就可以。

295
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:48,400
考呢個誒，即係嗰個所謂專業試嘅。

296
00:56:48,680 --> 00:57:08,690
嘅嘅第二部分，所以個個我哋叫一般叫P誒，即係Part Two啦。噉就後嚟有個P C L L，我即係七七十年代已經有個P C L L，但係嗰陣時候就後來咧都係規定咧，一定係要即係誒唔正即係誒一定要經香港嘅P C L L。咁呢個係再進一步啦，即係噉啊！

297
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,590
隨住亦都係跟住有三間大學。

298
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:31,400
咁咧就誒當時嗰個願意就係希望有好啲嘅，即係誒確保即係嗰啲入行嘅人士嗰個誒水平嘅專業水平係有保證嘅。所以大學嘅除咗學呢個法律學位之外，仲要經過大學誒要佢即係誒。

299
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:38,210
讀呢個B.S.B.C.L.而係香港嘅三間大學。好啦，咁其實一路落嚟咧，都係誒。

300
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:43,150
大家對個質素問題，我睇唔聽到，唔係話好多聲音係有質疑。

301
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:53,880
反而你一調翻轉話誒誒開放翻期，反而有啲人會話誒一個開放嘅市係咪有誒質素嘅保證咧？反而呢個問題會會有人提出嚟。

302
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:09,020
咁但係咧，我覺得依家我哋誒又睇到你有另外一個問題嗱，譬如就以我自己一間好細嘅律師事務所啦嚇，我得我有八有九個律師，但係我間律師事務所有有五個我哋叫paralegal。

303
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,240
全部係大學畢業，係有英國，係有誒澳洲。

304
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:24,930
就係誒，我覺得佢表現都係唔錯，但係咧係入唔到PCL，咁主要咧因為咧佢哋誒考試嘅時候咧，可能個成績。

305
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,540
誒達唔到個要求，可能係second class B或者甚至係叫set on啦。

306
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:48,030
噉佢經常問我個問題就係話：我應該點做咧？噉就係咪就放棄，因為重新再考過咧？噉就咁大家知道咧，你學位完成咗，你冇得再考過嘅。你唔同話，即係考過、考過，嗯，即係即係佢冇一個再叫再考過，使有個好啲嘅成績。

307
00:58:48,480 --> 00:59:01,940
咁所以有啲人問我係咪讀個L.O.M可以得啊噉樣？咁但係咧啲大學嘅教授話畀聽又唔係一定得嘅喎。噉啊睇下你讀成點樣？咁所以咧就係我可以同大家講咧，有一班年青人咧係。

308
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,710
好苦惱嘅。

309
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:21,560
非常之頹喪，佢其實佢係做得唔錯嘅，喺我哋見到佢有有啲人做得唔錯，反為即係有陣時成績好啲唔係一定做得好嘅，喺到專業大家都知道係兩兩件事嚟。噉佢話：你有冇個機會畀我咧？噉樣，噉佢哋會覺得咧就係誒，如果你開有一個開放嘅市。

310
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:41,850
你可能你嘅要求，你當然有一個有一個嚴格嘅要求嚇，保證即係唔會唔會唔會係低水平啦。點解你唔畀多個機會佢哋咧噉就嗱噉就係呢個係一個最大，同埋有好多人係需要工作嘅。佢話我係需要全職工，我冇辦法能夠抽一年出嚟咧，係係誒讀BCL嘅。咁但係我係有信心一個open exam，我係考到。

311
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,720
好嘅，噉就。

312
00:59:43,000 --> 01:00:03,010
同埋我可以繼續考嘅，考到滿意為止。就算你set嘅水準係係要高啲都好噉就，同埋都係一個即係誒，佢哋覺得係好公平嘅，因為咧考公開試嘅好處咧就係我改卷嘅人完全唔知道考試嘅人係邊個，咁呢個就係公開試其中一個最公平嘅地方。佢哋覺得大學呢邊有大學嘅好處。

313
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:13,750
老師即係個教授教學生，佢可能會有好多督導個方法，但係咧就係如果公開試係完全係一個標準嘅係一統一係補及。

314
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:34,040
冇一個即係老師同同學生之間嘅印象嘅關係，佢有有另有另外一種嘅公平性噉樣嗱。咁呢個就係我相信咧，即係有啲人會贊成一個一個開放式嘅嘅考試嘅存在嘅好處。不過當然我再我真係講多句，就知我做嗰時誒P C L L絕對有需要存在，我哋係珍惜亦。

315
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:54,050
都尊重大學一路呢多年嚟嘅貢獻，呢個絕對唔能夠被草提取提。但係多個途徑係咪都有都有佢個價值嘅道理？我覺得值得探討嘅。由於何議員又係用曬時間，我哋又係到最後整體回應。咁咧就而家阿謝偉俊議員舉咗手，誒跟住我自己亦都有誒會會問問題。噉我哋就。

316
01:00:54,050 --> 01:01:14,060
畫一條線，畀我哋議會嘅代表咧都有啲噉就誒，我諗係誒陶錦新議員之後，全部就誒冇得第二輪發問啦。我哋咧就誒會整體畀大家回應嘅。阿謝偉俊議員，係多謝主席。主席，本來我諗住發言，因為都而家係初步喺個準備做一個諮詢嘅。

317
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:20,520
期間，不過由於啊何主任語言剛才所講嘅啊內容咧，令到我都有想少少一個回應補充。

318
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:40,820
誒，雖然我唔會用好似阿石禮興元咁誒或者咁強嘅語言啦嚇，但係我都覺得咧，的而且確咧喺呢件事上咧，似乎我哋暫時未聽到一啲公眾利益嘅聲音，又或者係從一啲或者曾經試過啊考咗好多次考唔到，或者根本係好多年都想做律師，但係做。

319
01:01:40,820 --> 01:02:00,830
做唔到嘅人個聲音，希望有機會嘅時，我哋聽到多少少呢方面嘅反應。但係最重要，我想理解有啲誒事實嘅背景先咧。第一就想，剛才啊陳文敏教授講關於嗰個入學率嘅問題咧，我想我哋可唔可以下一節機會咧攞到啲嘅數字咧，就唔係淨係表面上睇話一一萬三千多個申請者而得大約五十percent嘅。

320
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:20,850
誒合格率，我想有個所謂比較好啲嘅一個一個一個breakdown，一個應該裏邊有當中有幾多係本地嘅三間大學嘅學生，無論係L.B.有揾J.D.嘅學生咧。誒誒，as opposed to the versus嗰啲係海外學生咧，又或者再係對嗰啲其他誒，如果唔係海外唔係香港，但係嗰啲。

321
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:40,860
所謂part timers啊，或者late achievers嗰啲自己讀書又做嘢誒，其他學位但係希望有考翻試嗰啲，我想了解下個情況係點樣。第二咧就回應翻剛才誒啊陳明教授都講起話一個，始終有個樽頸位咧，我哋要定嘅問題定喺邊度咧？咁定喺我哋喺學校喺。

322
01:02:40,860 --> 01:03:00,870
完全一個係大學自己控制嘅位置，譬如話係由L B上去P C L嗰個位置咧，定還是定喺由P C L出嚟之後入去行業裏邊揾工，無論係巴又好啊啊律師嘅行業又好嘅位置咧，定還是再深一層，就係話將來佢哋真係做埋training之後揾唔揾到工嘅另一回事咧噉。

323
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:20,880
咁但係，似乎睇翻其他國家咧，似乎比較少。香港咁咧，定咗喺學校嗰個位置，由L B去P C L位置，或者J D P C L咧，就你你自己做咩都好啦。喺嗰個位度咧，似乎一劍定江，一戰定江山咧，過唔到嗰個樽頸位咧，就以後都過唔到嘅。咁呢度咧，我同我同阿何俊仁議員都有經驗，就係話係的，而且確係唔少。

324
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:40,890
好嘅年青人，特別係嗰啲所謂誒以前未讀未有一個第一個學位係法律學位，但係啊，其實後來咧佢哋都誒奮發上啊上進，再考翻學位法律嘅學位，或者考翻CPE，然係再考PCO嗰陣時，嗰個關係好難過嘅。咁要而家咧，既然律師會佢哋嗰嗰個開中名義嘅。

325
01:03:40,890 --> 01:04:00,900
講法就唔係話想去取代大學嗰個權限做PCOU，只不過係一個多條路、多個求生門畀嗰啲有關嘅人士咧。我覺得呢個考慮咧係應該係要好審慎、好認真去睇睇。當然到最後咧，究竟個供求問題、水準問題、執行上好多技術上嘅問題點處理法咧？但係呢個亦都唔係完全係。

326
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:20,910
一個真空嚟，因為事實上喺我哋嘅好大嘅中老嘅中主角啦嚇，我哋最多啊法律學生畢業嘅地方咧，基本上咁多年嚟都係一路有兩條雙軌進行，一個就係學校嘅畢業生，一個就係誒出邊嘅佢哋叫C.P.E.啦嘅嘅學生出嚟。咁而睇翻誒，或者另外一點，我想補充就係我自

327
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:40,920
自己都有經驗，無論喺香港、喺澳洲嘅訓練又好，喺香港嘅PC又好咧，我覺得個比較時候咧，誒，與其講香港個係一個PCO係一個好實際嘅課程咧，我覺得相反咧，呢個係其實係將大學嗰個誒教唔曬嗰啲嘢咧，一個延伸版多啲。而事實上咧，佢哋個課個課程啊個。

328
01:04:40,920 --> 01:05:00,930
考試嘅方式嘅嗰個就係處理方法咧，係太多係喺嗰個academic side of things，即即係嗰個誒處理嗰啲誒理論上嘅。而相比我以前有機會讀過澳洲嘅人哋嘅訓練咧，係完完全全唔同嘅。甚至乎，如果我亦都做過巴嘅pupillage啦，嗰啲嗰先至真係係真係實際上嘅。

329
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:20,940
經驗訓練嚟噉，所以我覺得，如果P.C.O係仲係經常上，你話自己係一個實際上必須經過嘅嗰一個過程咧，我都係未必嘅。咁希望呢方面咧，我當而家仲係一個所謂一個開放式嘅態度睇呢件事。我希望大家可以再畀個機會去向向前一步嚇。多謝主席。好誒，咁咧就跟住係阿陶瑾新議員。

330
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:29,250
誒朱晴，我覺得就誒即係剛才誒我我都同意啊啊何俊仁議員同啊謝偉俊議員嘅講法嘅。

331
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:36,540
我我諗咧就誒誒陳文敏教授所講嗰度，即係有個樽頸嗰度咧，我係同意嘅。

332
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:42,980
因為誒，否則嘅話咧，就會誒嗰個成個行業嗰個發展啊等等咧，就未必係最好。

333
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:51,210
但係個問題咧就係，誒確實咧就係可可能咧，你可以有一個噉嘅制度咧，就係PCLL嗰啲咧就係。

334
01:05:51,490 --> 01:06:11,500
誒已經就係誒直上啦，即係OK啦。咁咧，你亦都唔需要讀咗PCL先去考嗰個Common Exam。咁但係咧，你始終咧呢個世界咧有啲圍珠啊嚇，噉就誒好好複雜嘅。即係可能佢亦都考做到LB，佢跟住可能或者去學著人哋先考嗰類噉樣嘅Paralegal或者任何。

335
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,300
台嘢噉樣。

336
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:20,900
但係咧，到最後咧，你如果只要喺set嗰個C E嗰度嗰個誒set到係你誒覺得係合理嘅水準。

337
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:28,160
然後再加埋，甚至咧，你誒有啲咩先決嘅條件嘅，OK啊？我唔知啦嚇，咁咧。

338
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,570
就最後咧，就誒你可以誒由PCL上加埋CE上嘅咧。

339
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:35,910
係一個數目。

340
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,520
你頂嘅數目。

341
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:44,410
咁而嗰個咧，你就係覺得嗰個咧就係個行最好嘅發展嘅誒香港嘅需要啊等等個方面考慮曬啦，噉啊～

342
01:06:44,840 --> 01:07:04,850
咁所以咧就誒，其實係係可以得嘅嚇。不過咧個問題咧就係誒，我唔知道實際執行即係呢個C E E啦。譬如要有幾多人，即係可能會唔會太多人去考啊？啊，噉你可能甚至即係你要定嗰個誒有資源去定嗰個出試卷啊，或者個。

343
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:10,670
方面咧，都都造成困難。即係招雞又唔會嘅，因為點解咧？因為你有咁多。

344
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:26,500
誒大學嘅學院，咁老實講，就算每年誒作一個集合噉樣，會度輪流揾揾揾啲代表出嚟去去集合嚟到誒set嗰個誒exam，噉我我覺得應該都可以誒做得到嘅。

345
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:46,790
咁所以唯一咧，我就諗諗嚟諗去咧，就係如果真係有一個噉樣所謂叫做誒誒第二個可能、第二個誒嘅可能性啊，係畀人去誒令到佢即係有有別於你要誒喺第度再行一轉翻嚟嗰啲啦嚇。噉係唔係有啲乜嘢嘅嘅嘅誒downside或者？

346
01:07:46,790 --> 01:08:06,800
內處咧，噉我都想最尾聽一聽嘅啊，即係係咪有一個問題或者一個擔心啲，有個好大嘅擔心咧噉啊。噉我主要就噉嘅睇，暫時噉嘅睇法嚇。好啊，陶議員有時間嘅邊一位想回應啊？陶議員嘅問題係好啊，可以我講幾句好簡單。首先咧，而家我哋。

347
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:19,840
做個顧問報告嘅原因咧，就係我哋想畀持份者咧，可以畀一啲意見我哋。究竟喺呢個所謂嘅CE Common Entry Exam，如果要推動呢個考試嘅話咧？

348
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:35,180
點樣去做嗱？我哋喺呢個階段咧，完全係冇細節，即係話幾多人去考，點樣去考，邊個出試卷。其實我哋都冇傾到呢樣嘢嘅。但係原則咧就係，究竟係咪需要個C E E？

349
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:41,960
香港律師會講得好清楚咧，我哋係冇考慮，諗都冇諗過要replace P C L L。

350
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:45,030
咁個原因咧，其實。

351
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:57,660
真係誒，你話係咪有好大嘅投訴？關於嗰個教學嘅誒誒質素咧，係冇嘅。但係咧個問題咧就係好多。

352
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:05,670
好多學生誒，可能even讀P.C.嗰年，因為誒失足。

353
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:15,180
過唔到PC，咁其實佢就玩完㗎咯。佢雖然有讀到PC，但係完成唔到PC，佢都玩完㗎咯。

354
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,690
喺我哋嘅立場咧，我哋而家畀咗顧問。

355
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,690
首先嘅睇法咧，就係我哋係需要個學生有LLB或者equivalent。

356
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:46,030
然後讀埋PCLL，咁但係咧頭先我講啦，我哋冇話你只能夠考一次嘅CCE，咁即係話有機會有人讀過PCLL嘅都可能唔需要淨係得一次機會去考個試啦。咁第二去解決PCL個問題。

357
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:52,800
係嘅，其實會唔會係或者有多啲嘅誒institution去教PCO咧？

358
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:07,240
香港律師會暫時都係覺得係需要有LLB嘅，誒，我亦都有啲會員覺得啊，可唔可以行翻舊制？誒誒，唔需要有個law degree，噉啊一路一路喺個律師樓度做，一路考。

359
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:15,600
我係誒開放嘅呢樣嘢，但喺呢個階段咧，我覺得我係想集中喺有法律學位嘅。

360
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:26,320
咁翻轉頭嚟講，如果繼續有PCL嘅話咧，其實就唔影響到大律師嘅，因為大家嗰啲學生都係讀緊嗰啲科目。

361
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:46,610
如果大律師公會覺得誒可以沿用翻現有嘅PCL誒嗰個考試嘅模式去嚟定誒邊啲同學係適合入誒誒日後做大律師，咁呢個亦都唔係好大嘅問題咯。咁最後咧就係咧誒香港律師會咧係。

362
01:10:46,610 --> 01:11:06,620
明白嗰個樽頸嘅問題，並唔係香港律師會可以解決嘅，因為呢個係學校收生嘅問題，係資源嘅問題嚟㗎。我我從來都冇諗過咧去做一啲嘢，會令到嗰個收生可以大啲嘅，因為講緊即係錢嘅問題。咁好似頭先誒。

363
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:26,650
阿阿阿，James講咧就話啊，我哋會三間大學可以考慮，或者喺而家現有嘅收生咧去加啲誒誒誒加啲學位。咁但係呢個唔係唔係嗰個問題啊，因為而家咧就係佢哋讀嘅科目係一樣，只係考試係唔同嘅。

364
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:37,520
三家大學考同一個科目嘅試卷都唔同㗎，噉我哋覺得為咗公平嘅起見咧，咁咪嚟考香港律師會一個。

365
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:38,760
uniform。

366
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:59,060
嘅考試咁三間大學去培訓啊，咁呢個就係我哋而家想做嘅嘢。大學我話齋，等個顧問報告出咗嚟咧，我好相信咧，嗯，主席咧一定會再邀請我哋翻嚟咧，就翻個顧問報告咧去誒去再解釋㗎。多謝李主席，好好多謝啊啊洪生嗱，噉樣咧就。

367
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:19,070
誒，我而家咧就我自己都想跟進一啲問題嘅噉，跟住咧我就會畀時間咁多嘅團體。頭先咧有一啲係冇機會回應嘅，都係可以大家表達嘅意見嗱。第一咧，我想問下大家咧，法律教育上次委員會咧，佢喺佢嗰個文件裏邊咧，佢就提出咗佢哋而家想就六個範圍咧係進行。

368
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:39,080
探討嘅噉，我想問下大家覺得呢個範圍足唔足夠啦？即係誒會唔會我哋其實就希望咧係更加改善整體嗰個成個嗰個啊法律教育嗰個質素嗰個運作咁？佢而家提咗六個嘅喺佢最後嗰個terms of reference，即係佢嗰個檢討範圍咁咧。

369
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:59,090
就第二咧，我亦都好想問下，即係誒咁多位咧嗱。譬如頭先係提到咧，三間大學可能係係咪誒？又是陳文敏教授好似提到咧，就係話未必有限額，但係咧喺嗰個專業嗰度咧，又有一啲嘅需求、啲要求。咁其實譬如話三間大學佢係譬如即係假設幾個誒。

370
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:19,100
誒途徑想聽下大家意見。誒你加咗啦，譬如PCL三間都加，加咗之後，然之後律師會咧又係會係，譬如佢哋而家建議或者考慮研究嚇增加一個嘅誒誒common entrance exam。嗱呢個可行性誒，大家又會唔會可以並存咧？

371
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:39,110
又一，即係話兩樣都做，配額又增加。誒誒，咁呢個又要聽下政府意見咯。配額增加喺錢嗰方面，又係咪符合咧？定係究竟呢個係咪你哋嘅願意咧？咁第二咧，就係喺嗰個誒現時，即係譬如誒唔少嘅同學，譬如頭先。

372
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:59,120
佢嚟講，佢哋係誒可能都已經係讀得好唔錯，但係真係入唔到啦。咁誒點樣可以畀佢哋係仲有一個機會？有冇一啲誒可以諗下嘅誒alternative，即係誒另外嘅方式咧？即係呢個係想大家可以翻去諗下。即係的確可能有好多佢係誒。

373
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:19,130
讀得唔好唔錯嘅，佢入唔到噉，佢咪誒向我哋議員或者其他嘅團體，佢都希望咧係研究一下要檢討噉。呢個想好想聽下大家嗰個嘅意見咁誒，我都將時間交畀大家。咁頭先第一個咧就係法律教育誒，上次委員會嗰六個範圍喺佢嘅。

374
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:29,180
嘅文件即係附設嘅文件嘅第四頁嘅，大家有冇印象嚇？除咗時間表同埋財政嗰度，我哋我哋委員會都會跟進啦嚇。

375
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:31,390
係。

376
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:51,680
我嘗試嘗試回答一下。我諗第一就係你講上次委員會嗰個討論嗰個範疇咧，其實佢哋已經經過一段時間嘅討論㗎啦。咁所以誒，即係我我我認為經過呢個討論之後嘅話，佢哋自己當然當然係覺得呢樣嘢係足夠㗎啦。咁因為我哋誒兩間誒律師會同埋大律師公會。

377
01:14:51,680 --> 01:15:01,300
會同埋三間大學係都喺嗰個常設委員會裏邊，咁所以誒，我哋係有充分噉樣去誒去參與呢一個討論嘅。

378
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:10,930
第二咧就係你問嗰個問題，就係話如果三間大學加學位，誒同埋我哋嗰個CE可唔可以一齊從步進行？

379
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:31,220
其實誒，我其實啱啱都有誒都有誒講過㗎啦。就係咧，如果誒學位增加嘅咧，增加好多嘅咧誒，同埋如果再多啲，好似洪師啱啱咁講話，多啲第啲嘅P.C.L.L嘅供應者誒入呢一個市場嘅話咧。

380
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:46,870
我哋係啊，係咪可以誒誒律師會係咪可以以現行嘅機制裏邊去睇得住啊所有嘅水準同埋佢個機制咧？我哋係可能唔足夠資源嘅。

381
01:15:47,150 --> 01:16:07,160
咁但係咧，與此同時嘅話，我哋不如就將我哋嘅資源咧放咗喺投放咗喺呢一個私醫醫院裏邊，然後咧其他嘅資源，我哋就可即係其他大學，我哋嗰個監察可能可以放輕少少。咁如果係噉樣嘅話，你加到二千個學位，加到一萬個學位。

382
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:07,680
位。

383
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,400
我哋可能係都可以應付得到嘅。

384
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:29,270
好啊！咁啱啱時間就誒夠啦。噉我哋咧就畀個個嘅團體、三間大學嘅法學院嘅代表誒先回應咗，或者係再繼續表達你哋嘅一啲嘅意見，就住頭先嘅討論。陳文敏教授。

385
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:49,590
主席，嗯，其實我哋講咗成個晏晝，究竟我哋想解決啲乜嘢問題咧？啊，噉我都聽唔到。究竟其實我哋想解決啲咩問題？第一，我哋知道就話而家對PCL嗰個課程嘅質素咧係冇質疑嘅。咁剩翻嘅咧，啊，噉係學位嘅問題啊，係。

386
01:16:49,590 --> 01:17:09,600
律師會冇辦法或者唔足夠嘅人手去監管嘅問題啊？嚇，定係話三間大學因為三間大學考試或者個水平唔同而出現嘅問題咧？其實我哋講來講，我哋唔好知道我哋面對啲咩問題，因為你唔解決，唔唔唔先解決，究竟我哋要面對咩問題咧？根本就唔可以話嗰個。

387
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:29,610
學師係咪可以解決到我哋想解決嘅問題？咁第一先就從監管個方面去睇咧。其實喺除咗喺美國話有三百幾間大學咧，其實喺英國都有二十幾間咧，唔同嘅大學佢哋係白考唔同嘅市嚇，亦都係用唔同嘅嘅水平，亦都係由law society一間咧係去監察。

388
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:49,650
個問題就係你用乜嘢方法去監管嘅啫。咁呢度即係我哋都即係同意律師會就話，其實我哋係應該考慮唔同嘅方法去去啊監管嘅。噉我哋都過往都提過話，譬如喺美國嘅方法就係你唔係年年做，但係可能係隔年或者隔幾年嚟做嘅時候，但係每次做得深入啲。咁其實有好多其他嘅方。

389
01:17:49,650 --> 01:18:05,290
法或者譬如而家嘅監管係基本上係啊用律師咧係好喺公餘時間有時間先至去做嘅，係咪應該有個全職嘅人甚至係全職嘅部門嚟做法律學教育嘅監察咧？外國呢度係有唔同嘅方法可以做嘅。

390
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,940
咁第二個咧係關於嗰個啊。

391
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:29,240
你話係咪會有一個個啊其他嘅渠道咧？咁其實即係正華律師會都講過，我哋或者頭先何俊仁律師都提過，我哋會唔會翻返去以前嗰個制度，就話甚至唔需要法律學位，你都可以做律師咧？噉我哋睇到以前出現嘅問題就係水準好參差嘅。咁如果因為經過咁多年，我哋先至。

392
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:49,250
要要有法律學位，有P.C.L.L.噉，我哋會唔會走緊回頭路咧？咁其實律師會都覺得係要有個L.L.B. degree，你先至可以入呢個法律啊行業嘅。咁而律師會其實畀我哋嘅要求唔單止係個L.L.B. degree，係律師會亦都要求要一個good L.L.B. degree，一個good two two degree即係二級啊，越等榮譽一個。

393
01:18:49,250 --> 01:19:09,260
好嘅二等二等名譽，咁呢個係一路我哋用嘅一個個標準嚟嘅。咁而家其實啊，為咗回應頭先啊啊石議員所講嘅話，即係我哋係咪有好多人啊？我哋係係將係擰出門外咧？其實我哋擰出門外嘅人係因為佢哋唔達嗰個水平嘅。咁嗰一千三百幾人入邊有百。

394
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:29,270
百分之五十考唔到入嚟咧，有啲係因為佢哋係啱啱攞bear pass嘅，啱啱緊緊合格嘅，有啲係三級榮譽嘅，有啲係過唔到嗰個conversion exam嘅。咁呢啲其實都係律師會最低嘅要求。我哋係咪話有個CEE，我哋就放棄呢啲最低嘅要求咧？如果我哋唔放棄呢啲最低要求，你仍然係面對緊。

395
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,200
同一樣嘅問題嘅啫，只會係。

396
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,200
噉。

397
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:52,890
哦，仲有學係係嗰個學位，話係咪學位不足咧？我哋嘅學位其實似乎我哋唔係聽到好多學位不足嘅問題。我哋同意係話可能有部分人喺考試考唔好嘅時候，佢未有第二個機會。所以呢個我哋係三間學院亦都願意去睇呢個問題嘅。咁而呢個我哋係覺得有其。

398
01:19:52,890 --> 01:20:12,900
他嘅方法去解決係用一個司醫未必能夠解決到呢一個問題，反而司醫會帶嚟好多其他嘅負面嘅因素，包括係其實會令到進入法律行業係更加困難。咁呢個係咪符合公眾利益咧？啊，我哋嘅我我哋喺呢度作少一個回應。好誒，嗱，因為我哋嘅時間咧係有。

399
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:18,290
無限嘅，我好希望回應嘅時候，盡量喺兩分鐘之內。阿陳景新先生。

400
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,780
我我首先講咧，就係。

401
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:30,320
大律師公會咧，對於律師會依個建議咧，發覺就冇一個定稿嘅原因咧，就係我哋都唔係好知道律師會想係想做咩嘢。

402
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:50,610
咁但係第二個原因咧，就係我今日聽見嘅咧，就係當我睇見有common exam entrance examination咧，我第一個印象就係話任何人都要考。如果唔係common，如果唔係學嚟common，但而家聽聽下咧，就似乎有人嘅意見咧，就係話要有。

403
01:20:50,610 --> 01:21:04,300
個同埋PCL平衡嘅考試，令到人唔使讀PCL都可以考過試嘅。咁呢樣嘢係另外一回事嚟嘅。我我希望大家要諗清楚，究竟我係想愛嘅係咩嘢？

404
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,030
好。

405
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:09,900
仲有冇其他嘅係Professor Christopher King？

406
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:14,320
Thank you very much, Chair. Two very brief comments. We've

407
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:34,750
We've had a number of very important and interesting contributions from the the panel this afternoon. I think one thing that becomes clear to me is is that we haven't been in the universities particularly good about telling people what we actually do in the PCLL. I'm afraid that I would have to take some exception to.

408
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:54,760
The observation that the PCLL is too theoretical, I know from my own direct experience in examining in the PCLL that it's anything but theoretical. It's meant to be hands-on. It's meant to be skills-based. And my general impression is that that's exactly what it is. We do and what we strive to. We can always do better. I think we all have to concede.

409
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:14,770
That and I think that that that how can we do better is perhaps something that will come out of the the standing committee's review. I think that the the suggestion that the universities are are stashing away large amounts of money from the PCCL, I think, really can't go unchallenged. The PCCL, frankly, is not.

410
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:34,780
A money maker. At least in my own faculty, the PCLL operates effectively at cost, at break even. And I think once we are under pressure from the UGC to revise the cost of the PCLL, then that all may have to change. But at the moment, the PCLL is not.

411
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:54,790
係一個great money maker。我唔該，我亦都加，我們唔係包裝PCCL嘅學生係香港外邊。我有我嘅數據喺面前，喺度。喺2013、2014年，只有15%嘅入學係非本地學生。

412
01:22:54,790 --> 01:23:09,750
85% are local graduates, so I think it's very important that as we go forward in this debate, and I'm sure we'll come back to many of these issues, that we bear in mind that there is a strong evidential basis for what we're doing.

413
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,830
好，仲有冇係林峯教授？

414
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:33,120
Yes, thank you, chair. Just two quick comments. I think today's discussion is about really very important issue on how to train future lawyers and admit future lawyers in Hong Kong. Whether we are going to use CCE or bar exam in the states or follow our traditional course of PCLL.

415
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:53,210
所以，如果你 remember 幾個月 ago， and we made a response to a JD student complaint about this issue， and which was published in the Hong Kong Lawyer， and the three law schools' position is actually open on that particular issue， depends on the consensus of the society.

416
01:23:53,210 --> 01:24:05,950
如果兩支法律專業可以reach the consensus，and plus the Hong Kong society can reach the consensus about the future，of course any changes can be made there.

417
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:26,420
and so it's not really we are defending a sort of vested interests here. and the second point is the real thing about for the introduction of CE is the justifications and several other commentators have already mentioned. we are a bit confused now. what's the exact

418
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:38,220
justification for the introduction of CE. I think that need to be debated and to be and a consensus need to be reached. And the last point is about the admission of non-local students.

419
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:49,510
It's much more complicated. It's not within the university's sole control, actually, because that's relating to the Hong Kong SAS legal education policy.

420
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,830
and also relating to their admission policy, I remember about fifteen.

421
01:24:55,110 --> 01:25:00,060
16年前，的 admission to the bar needs.

422
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:03,470
The applicant needs to be a permanent resident.

423
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:18,480
need to be here for seven years, okay? But now that has been abolished, so it's not the university's control. It's relating to the whole Hong Kong SAR government's policy. Thank you, Chan。係跟住係。

424
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:38,770
得啊！突然唔係唔係，我話畀你聽，因為我想更更更正咧。唔係唔係，我而家講講，因為我即刻要解釋佢聽咧。佢係混淆咗混淆咗兩件事，唔係難到而家有好多香港學生唔係揸香港一香港誒個law degree嗰啲喺外國翻嚟係香港人嚟㗎，所以咧頭先我。

425
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:58,780
依啲你睇到咧係教育教育署嗰啲figure唔係喺曬依度，所以咧兩件事，我哋嗰個我哋嗰啲教育咧係二十個percent咧係畀外來學生，但係而家依啲係香港學生喺外國讀law degree唔係喺香港讀J.D. and L.B.嗰啲，所以頭先啊C.T.U.個月教授咧話淆咗，我想喺度解釋翻佢。

426
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:18,790
好得誒，跟住我哋係要畀政府嘅阿黃專員特別咧，想睇下頭先陳敬新先生話誒冇冇錢喎做嗰個檢討，你哋可唔可以答下？即係點解因為冇錢，所以冇時間表？我哋就好想了解一下啦。係主席，嗯係誒，亦都明白到其實剛才提咗個。

427
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:38,800
幾核心嘅問題就係關於話做個全面檢討，涉及嗰個誒財務安排上高。誒呢度我想表達翻就係因為一直以嚟嘅討論，環繞嘅重點就係睇下會唔會用到個ConversionExam嗰間公司入邊嘅資源。並未排除政府可能提供資源嘅嘅渠道。咁所以呢個我諗喺個誒上次委員會入邊咧。

428
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:58,810
其實係會繼續討論呢個問題。咁至於另外一方面咧，其實我哋都誒覺得好，今日有機會聽到唔同嘅意見，誒，但係亦都好感覺到就係入邊唔同嘅意見有好多係需要即係進一步整合。其中我睇到有一個比較重要嘅地方就係，究竟需唔需要CER？如果有嘅話，究竟佢同PCL嘅關係？因為頭先亦都。

429
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:18,820
聽到啲意見就係會唔會兩者係並行，並不代表一定要經過C.E.可以透過P.C.L.去進行咧噉樣。咁誒，似乎呢度嗰兩者嘅關係點樣？我估嚟緊應該係會有機會進一步去去討論。咁至於最後嘅都係翻返去，我哋政府而家都係採取一個開放嘅態度，亦都希望係能夠有一個即係對於香港嘅法律教育，我哋。

430
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:26,410
係特別關注，因為直接係影響香港作為一個啊高質素嘅法律服務同埋仲裁，或者係啊。

431
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:46,700
其他即係解決糾紛嘅地方噉，所以我哋都會係積極參與今次嗰個即係探討噉樣。多謝主席。好誒，我諗咧，今次咧只係就有關嘅議題咧係第一次初步嘅討論嚇，因為咧律師會嗰個誒研究顧問報告係未出啦。咁頭先講法律教育嗰個檢討報告應該可能未。

432
01:27:46,700 --> 01:28:06,710
展開淨係講咗嗰個範圍，噉我諗咧，我哋委員會咧亦都會揾法律教育嘅上次委員會佢哋傾下，究竟係財務問題定係其他問題？誒呢個咧就係我哋希望都可以誒瞭解一下咧嗰個進度，因為有一啲客觀嘅研究出嚟咧，咁大家去討論起嚟咧，亦都會比較。

433
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:19,350
客觀一啲，誒咁第二咧就係誒我相信咧誒我哋會喺誒律師會誒嘅報告誒如果出咗，同埋咧係誒法律教育。

434
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:39,640
上次委員會佢哋有一啲進展嘅時候，我哋本委員會都會繼續再傾下點樣跟進呢個問題。好，副主席。啊，主席啊，我有一個建議啊，因為既然大家今日提出咗咁多問題啦，係就住而家律師會嘅諮詢誒裏邊嘅一啲事宜啦，即係我喺度諗就係其實律師會可。

435
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:59,650
唔可以喺嗰份報告係正式確立之前咧，將嗰個草稿係交去畀所有嘅持份者同埋呢個委員會，我哋睇一次，跟住上嚟再傾，你先去finalize，先去去誒正式確立嗰份報告咧，可唔可以咁做咧？因為而家大家好多問。

436
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:07,920
問題啊，因為即係嗰啲問題，我相信大家都同意係好誒，係好有好有即係需要解答嘅嚇。好。

437
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,300
葉生，係。

438
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,070
謝偉俊議員。

439
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:31,420
啊！Dennis嘅建議有保留，因為而家律師會嗰個意見個顧問報告唔係一個話要我哋馬上有啲咩行動要做嘅，政府啲咩行動要做嘅嘢，誒係只係佢哋自己本會嘅一個意見咧。我唔覺得點解需要喺個drop嗰時要畀其他人睇過之後先做。相反咧，我覺得如果有機會能夠我哋可以喺本會度咧係一個比較。

440
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:51,430
公開少少嘅過程咧，畀一啲其他持份者、公眾人士聽到嘅意見，可能會更加合適添。因為呢個可能我哋做可能合適，過度施工會自己揾人做。噉，我覺得呢個如果係可以安排到嘅話，可能係更加好。好，阿陳健林議員。阿主席，我同意啊，謝偉俊議員剛才嗰個意見。另外咧，我就想提一提咧，就係大陸施工會同埋。

441
01:29:51,430 --> 01:30:11,440
三間院校咧，即係你哋係咪可以研究下都考慮？譬如話誒，即係都為咗香港嗰個即係律師界嗰個誒水平啊，各方面嘅嘢。確實而家存在嘅三間院校咧考嘅嘢咧都係唔同嘅，可唔可以誒有一個劃一嘅一個考試？

442
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:31,450
全部咧都可以畀C誒P.C.L.A嘅學生三間院校考同一份卷，咁誒連同咧就係律師誒會所提嘅嗰個C嚇都一齊，大家都係考嗰同一份卷，噉係咪都好啲咧？咁甚至到就係譬如誒舊年誒考唔到嘅學生，今年。

443
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:48,150
佢如果係經過自己嘅努力，佢又可以去參與嗰個考試，咁又得唔得咧？咁噉我覺得咧就誒，大家都可以誒雙方面研究一下，係共同咧係攞咗一個咧比較好嘅一個方法嚟解決呢個問題。好，跟住係謝禮謙主席啊，我想咧。

444
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,750
經過你咧。

445
01:30:50,030 --> 01:31:10,040
你畀翻政府誒education bureau畀我哋嘅教育局嗰個局長畀我哋嗰啲資料咧，係由二零一一年、二零一二年，因為嗰啲係啲大學收PCLL，佢哋睇到冚唪唥喺曬依一度主席，冚唪唥頭先我講嗰啲冚唪唥係事實喺度，所以頭先阿陳文敏誒。

446
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:30,050
啊！教授咧就話：佢啲學生唔好，唔收到噉。你又呢度睇，呢度睇到咧。喺你去收外國翻嚟嘅香港學生，我唔講乜嘢，因為比起而家香港喺香港讀法律嘅學生，咁一個質素咧，比人哋人哋翻嚟嘅啲好好多。因為佢係收四廿三percent同四廿幾percent啊，人係香港梗係讀多啲啊。

447
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:50,060
咁依個咧就係帶出一個好大嘅問題，即係質素。咁點解我哋今日要主席？點解今日要講依依個事項咧？好多謝依個，好多謝依個誒誒誒律師公會康所誒攞出三字攞攞出嚟依個問題。依個都係一個公眾嘅利益嚟㗎。公眾嘅利益咧係要有一個。

448
01:31:50,060 --> 01:32:10,070
公平、公開同埋公公道，所以咧一個從喺個。如果第二樣嘢，政府要考慮咧，係咪要開放咗呢個唔係淨係三間大學可以有法律替嘅，係我哋而家有九間大學，另外啲都可以考慮，令到佢哋一。

449
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:30,080
一樣可以做P.C.L，一樣可以考慮去做C.E.E，即係百花齊放。五十年代共產黨都有百花齊放，點解而家我哋唔可以以時並進咧？主席，多謝阿石議員誒，多謝大家嘅意見。噉我諗咧，今日咧就誒個討論都好熱烈。我好相信咧，我哋係誒會誒有仲。

450
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:50,090
再有機會去進出討論嘅，因為我哋今日嘅時間咧已經係超時啦。亦都知道大家好想回應㗎，係咪？因為議員都提到啊，現時嗰個運作噉，我就誒多謝大家嘅出席。我相信我哋會啊，提供更多其他嘅機會咧，我哋可以讓議員亦都瞭解一下咧。

451
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:53,890
現時嗰個喺法律教育嗰個運作嘅，多謝大家。

452
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:18,090
好，跟住落嚟咧，我哋就要進入下一個啊議程嘅項目。下一個議程嘅項目咧就係《成文法集項條文條例草案》。咁相關嘅文件咧係C B括弧四二二五足十三-hyphen十四括。

453
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:22,200
零四就係政府當局提供嘅文件。

454
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:42,500
噉我哋亦都係邀請咗咧，其他立法會議員咧係可以參與呢一個項目嘅討論嘅。咁而家咧，我哋首先係邀請律政司高級助理法律政策專員尹平少女士，噉佢先係進入我哋嘅議事廳。

455
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:57,890
亦都咧會對有關嘅文件咧係誒作出簡介嘅，咁咧就等政府當局係誒結束咗佢哋嗰個嘅意見之後咧，我哋就會開放畀各位委員發問嘅。

456
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:11,590
首先咧，就係請尹平少女士。係，多謝主席。

457
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:12,850
嗯。

458
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:33,360
政府咧喺過往一直有一個做法咧，就係不定期或者通常相隔幾年咧就會提交一個《城文法集項規定條例草案》。咁裏邊咧就係收羅咗誒對不同嘅條例誒作出嘅修訂。咁呢修訂大致上係屬於技術性，同埋我哋認為誒冇。

459
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:53,370
冇咁爭議性嘅修訂嘅。咁今次一個誒二零一四年成文法集行規定條例草案，亦都唔例外。咁裏邊咧，我哋誒今次收錄咗咧，大概即係當然有好多嘅修訂啦。但係主要嘅修訂咧係有十個，咁已經咧喺誒立法會C B Q四。

460
01:34:53,370 --> 01:35:01,660
二二五一三一四年度庫零四號文件裏邊咧係列出，咁而家我係好扼要噉樣講講呢啲修訂。

461
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:22,210
第一項誒主要修訂咧係關乎刑事罪行條例嘅，噉係有兩個誒案例咧，就係Leon T C William Voi versus Secretary for Justice，同埋咧係律政司司長對邱玉龍呢兩個案件咧，本地法院咧係已經宣佈咗刑事罪行條。

462
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:36,730
條例裏邊某一啲條文咧係違反基本法同埋香港人權法案，咁所以而家保安局咧係建議廢除啊或者修訂咧依一啲已經被本地法院宣判為違反基本法嘅條文。

463
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:57,430
第二項主要修訂咧係對四條誒反歧視條例誒提出嘅，咁主要係有四個方面。第一咧就係廢除性別歧視條例附表五第二部裏邊某一啲項目。第二咧就係可以令到平平等機會委員會咧可以根據殘。

464
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:02,560
《殘疾歧視條例》咧，係發出關乎歧視性做法嘅執行通知。

465
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:22,850
第三咧就係為評議會嘅成員同埋職員咧係提供保障，令到佢哋喺執行殘疾歧視條例同埋家庭崗位歧視條例裏邊嘅職能嘅時候咧，只要佢哋係以真誠行事咧，係無需負上法律責任。嗱，依一個保障咧已經喺另外嗰兩條反歧。

466
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,140
歧視條例裏邊咧，係已經提供咗啦。

467
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:43,230
第四方面咧就係修訂四條反歧視條例裏邊部分條文嘅中文版文本。啊，依啲修訂咧都係由評議會提出，而係得到咧係誒政制及內地事務局同埋勞工及福利局咧係誒認啊贊同而提出嘅。

468
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:48,370
第三至五項嘅主要修訂咧，都係涉及證據條例。

469
01:36:49,020 --> 01:37:09,030
誒，首先咧就係誒公正作為或者文書律政司係因應香港國際公正人協會嘅要求，亦都喺諮詢咗兩個律師會同埋司法機構之後咧，係建議修訂證據條例，以表明除非相反證明成立，否則喺香港註冊嘅。

470
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:22,590
公證人佢哋所作出嘅公證作為，或者佢哋已備嘅公證文書，係可以無需進一步證明喺香港法院嘅民事法律程序中，或接納為妥為認證嘅證據。

471
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:44,320
另外，一項修訂咧係誒因應我哋誒香港喺相互法律協助，即係mutual legal assistance嗰啲主要嘅夥伴誒嘅要求嘅，咁律政司都係建議修訂證據條例同埋刑事事宜相互法律協助條例咧，係令對根據一啲啊相互。

472
01:37:44,320 --> 01:38:04,330
法律協助請求書而攞到嘅外地公共銀行日常業務同埋電腦記錄咧，如果佢哋係誒附附連喺一啲根據呢一啲文書當地嘅司法管轄區咧係有説明事實嘅責任嘅誒一啲文件嘅時候咧，我哋係會容許。

473
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:10,780
佢誒被香港法院接納為咧係誒裏邊所講嘅事實嘅表面證據。

474
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:32,990
誒第五項主要修訂係由司法機構提出嘅，就現時證據條例第八十一條咧，係賦權香港法庭同埋審裁處喺審案嘅時候咧，個法官或者司法人員係可以將任何被合法羈押嘅人咧，係帶到庭前咧係詢問。咁唯獨是呢條條文咧。

475
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:53,000
似乎係遺漏咗咧，係土地審裁處噉，所以咧，我哋而家係建議咧，係加翻入一個誒土地審裁處嘅法官同埋司法人員。另外咧，司法機構咧亦都係建議修訂土誒土地審裁處條例第六A條嚟到咧，係清楚定明誒佢哋裏邊嘅站位。

476
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,610
成員咧係可以行使同常任成員相同嘅權力。

477
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:02,830
第六至第七項嘅主要修訂係由律師會提出嘅。

478
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:23,120
噉啊，首先咧喺一九九七年嘅時候咧，我哋通過咗一條條例叫《法律服務立法集項修訂條例》。咁依個咧係引入一個律師法團，即係本地嘅律師行咧，係啊，其實係喺香港誒經營嘅律師行係可以以有限公司嘅形式咧係經營。咁但係當時咧就將好多條文裏。

479
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:43,130
邊凡係提出本地律師或者外地律師咧，就一概改為咧呢一個法律執業實體。咁呢一個詞嘅定義咧，係包括咗呢一個誒，即係律師法團。咁而家誒律師會理事會咧，又議決話，如果做trustee咧，即係呢啲受託人嘅話咧，噉佢哋必

480
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:54,520
必須係自然人，即係只係律師啫。律師法團咧就唔可以做依一啲受託人，咁所以而家依個修訂咧係將佢改翻轉頭嘅，即係喺有關條文裏邊。

481
01:39:55,220 --> 01:40:15,230
第七項主要修訂咧，就係誒，亦都係律師會建議嘅，因為而家如果有誒一啲紀律聆訊嘅話咧，對律師噉啊，佢係可以作出一個暫時吊銷律師嘅執業資格，或者係外地律師嘅註冊。咁呢個暫時吊銷即係suspend個practice。

482
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:28,620
咁律師會覺得咧係有需要咧喺佢認為適當嘅情況下，可以撤銷或者恢復呢個暫時吊銷嘅決定，嚇，直至到咧呢個律師紀律審裁處嘅最終決定。

483
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:49,070
第八節同埋第九項主要修訂咧，都係由商務及經濟發展局提出嘅。首先咧，就係根據一個喺中審法院嘅判詞，就係理道嚟數香港特別行政區裏邊咧，中審法院認為咧，《商品説明條例》第二十六條四條咧，其實係應該。

484
01:40:49,070 --> 01:41:07,510
從合而解釋，咁裏邊咧對被告施加嘅咧，只係一個援引證據嘅責任，即係evidential burden。而嗰個誒舉證責任咧，legal burden咧，係應該係由控方咧係誒負責嘅。咁所以咧，我哋係會誒作出修訂。

485
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:28,680
第九項嘅修訂咧，就係非應邀電子信息條例。根據呢條條例咧，通訊事務管理局咧，根據裏邊某啲條文發出嘅通知咧，尤其是一啲係執行佢裏邊嗰啲條文咧，佢而家係好狹窄嘅規定，一定只可以咧係用掛號信嘅形式送達呢個通知。

486
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:38,110
咁而家，嗯，局方咧係要求咧係加入另外兩種嘅送達方式，即係一係揾人派啦，或者係以普通郵遞嘅方式。

487
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:53,140
最後一個主要修訂係建築物建誒管理條例。咁根據現行條文咧，業主立案發團管理委員會嘅委員喺獲委任之後咧，二十一日內佢要提交一個法定聲明，即係statutory declaration。

488
01:41:53,430 --> 01:42:13,440
嚟到咧係表明咧佢係合符資格係出任呢一個委員，咁但係呢個statutory declaration咧係全部都係要宣誓嘅，咁誒誒好多人都覺得唔係好方便，咁所以咧而家誒民政事務局咧係建議咧誒省卻呢個宣誓嘅需要，噉係改。

489
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,980
以咧書面申報嘅形式咧，係取代依一個法定聲明。

490
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:38,270
嗱，依條條例咧草案將會包羅其他誒誒技術嘅或者修訂，噉我都唔會喺依度再一一講㗎啦。咁大家都見到我今日有好多同事咧係一齊出席嘅，都係相關政策局嘅同事。咁咧係就議員啊喺佢哋個政策範疇裏邊嘅建議咧。

491
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:41,020
有提問嘅話咧，佢哋都係好樂意解答。

492
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:52,260
好多謝阿尹專員。咁而家咧就邀請各位委員誒發問啦。噉我就想再問一次，仲有邊一位委員會係想問問題嘅？

493
01:42:52,730 --> 01:43:12,740
咁首先咧就係阿陳志全議員，噉佢就誒而家因為唔係咁多人舉手，我係畀五分鐘阿陳志全議員。多謝主席。首先咧都要多謝律政司，終於咧都肯去修改刑事罪行條例一一八之中有關男性同性性行為合法年齡之中被判。

494
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:14,140
違憲嘅條例。

495
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:29,930
因為咧呢啲條例咧，其實喺二零零五年咧已經被裁定為欠，二零零六年咧政府上訴係被駁回，咁今年係二零一三年啦，呢個集項修訂就係二零一四年啦，足足係七年。

496
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:43,060
有多點解點解要拖咁耐咧？呢個係我第一條問題。由於政府咧拖咗咁多年都冇去修改或者廢除呢啲被判違憲嘅條例啦，好多香港人。

497
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:51,410
甚至係男同志佢哋自己咧，都唔知道男男嘅合法性交年齡究竟係幾多歲，仲係以為係廿一歲。

498
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,170
其實而家係十六歲。

499
01:43:54,660 --> 01:44:01,000
咁唔單止一般市民，甚至係前線嘅執法人員咧，有啲都係搞唔清楚。

500
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:09,380
前線執法人員咧，我哋有啲案例咧，仲係用緊舊法，即係被廢除咗嘅條例咧，去拘捕一啲。

501
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:14,230
啊，同未夠廿一歲性交嘅男性。

502
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:35,010
咁呢個咧，我真係好希望保安局嘅同事，如果聽到咧，翻去真係要去話畀你啲前線嘅工作人員聽呢條法咧。二零零六年已經廢咗㗎啦，嚇唔好再用啦。雖然去到法庭咧係會畀法官鬧走嘅，有冇搞錯啊？即係都廢咗，你仲拎上嚟啊？但係亦都好難怪。

503
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,030
因為嗰條法就係得呢條法，我呢個月咧仲收到就係。

504
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:46,830
警察入屋拘捕嘅時候，都係因為佢係要宣佈宣讀翻呢條法啊嘛，呢條法都係二十一歲。

505
01:44:47,110 --> 01:45:01,720
咁所以，我真係希望局方係要盡快處理。咁但係咧，而家咧修訂或者廢除呢啲咧，都係2006年同埋2007年被判違憲嘅其中一部分嘅條例。

506
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:22,010
嗱，譬如如果你將男男嘅誒肛交年齡合法年齡係降到十六歲咧，咁喺一一八D裏邊咧就係講緊男女同廿一歲以下女童作出肛交，噉你就呢條亦違憲㗎咯。咁但係咧今次咧，照我所知應該係未處理嘅。其實。

507
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:37,410
喺呢一組即係一八裏邊好多條例啦，有好多都係只針對男男性行為，係冇咧相應係針對男女性行為嘅。其實從男女平等呢個精神，即係從嗰個之前判違憲嗰個原則咧。

508
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:50,860
都涉嫌違憲。如果有人提出司法程序咧，我係覺得係輸緊㗎啦。噉我想問誒律政司，你會點樣處理餘下呢啲涉嫌違憲嘅條例咧？

509
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:59,750
即係同志團體就話畀我知，佢係隨時準備啟動司法程序。如果你話判咗違憲嘅先會改，冇判違憲嘅就慢慢嚟。

510
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:20,040
咁噉就告畀你睇咯，逐條逐條告畀你睇。咁到底而家政府嘅修法時間表係點樣咧？另外咧，其實除咗呢個男女嘅誒性別不平等之外咧，誒對於判刑啊，即係男男嘅性罪行咧，嗰個無論係法例上嘅最高刑罰，或者係實際上。

511
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:30,300
嘅判處咧，都係有一個好大嘅差別嘅。譬如男男性交最高刑罰係終身監禁，但係男女性交罪咧，即係最高刑罰咧係五年。

512
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:50,590
而保安局畀同志團體由二零零七年至二零一一年有關誒男男性罪行同十六歲以下男子作出同性肛交罪行咧，判處即時入獄嘅比例咧係高達五十四點八嘅percent，刑期係由九個月至到最少九年不等，但係同十六歲以下女。

513
01:46:50,590 --> 01:47:03,850
同性交嘅案例咧，即時入獄嘅比例係十一點七嘅percent，誒判刑咧係由少於三個月至於至少於六年不等。咁呢個都係有一個唔平等嘅情況。希望誒律政司或者有關當局可以回應。好。

514
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:12,400
有邊一位？誒，請保安局嘅下下誒代表阿江小姐回應，因為佢係相關嘅政策局。好。

515
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:34,040
主席，啊，多謝陳議員嘅提問。咁咧就啊，有幾部分嘅問題啦。噉我就逐一去去回應嚇。咁咧就誒，其實自從誒誒零五零六年咧有關嘅法院判決之後咧，誒其實有一點誒必須要指出嘅，就係其實相關違憲嘅條文咧。

516
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:54,050
其實嗰個法律效力咧係已經係即時去去失去咗嗰個法律嘅效力，因此咧係誒就住呢幾條條文咧係律政司咧係都係冇再提出上訴，但係咧誒冇再提出呢一個起訴嚇，咁誒就要陳議員頭誒誒提醒咧，就係警方嘅執法其實之前都有個交流咧，就係陳議員都。

517
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:59,880
提過我哋咧，就要翻去提醒警方係有關於執法方面嘅問題。噉我哋其實誒。

518
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:20,230
我哋都已經係同警方再講咧，就係要求佢哋咧係提醒前線嘅人員係誒必須要咧係清楚咧呢啲嘅條文咧已經係冇咗嗰個法律效力。縱使我哋咧誒而家我哋係希望盡快去更新呢一個刑事上條例嗰個法律文本嘅嚇，咁呢個係一啲補充嚇。咁另外咧就。

519
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:40,240
就誒講到點解做咁耐咧？咁其實喺誒零六年嗰個法院判決之後咧，誒當時律政司司長同埋中審法院嘅首席法官咧，都係誒立刻咧係要求嗰個法律改革委員會咧係做一個全面性嘅檢討，就住所有嘅性罪行同埋相關嘅罪行嘅法律嚇。咁因為其實嗰個檢討。

520
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:47,180
冇咧係誒非常之複雜，咁誒誒誒，法改委都成立咗個小組啦，係性罪行檢討小組委員會。

521
01:48:47,460 --> 01:49:07,470
係啊，工作一路都喺度誒進行緊。噉佢哋誒誒個檢討咧，其實係好全面，亦都有幾項指導性嘅原則，我想都可以喺度補充嘅。誒，佢哋嘅檢討咧嗰個方向就係必須係要尊重性嘅自主權啦、保護原則啦、無分性別啦、避免基於性傾向咧係作出一個分別。

522
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:27,480
嘅嚇，咁其實佢哋第一部分嘅諮詢文件咧，喺誒誒去年已經係係誒誒出咗，噉佢哋嚟緊咧都會做第二部分嚇，噉我哋第二部分嘅諮詢文件咧係會誒涉及咧係以保護原則為依據嘅罪行嚇，咁誒即係嗰啲誒誒同意嘅年齡咧，但係就冇。

523
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:47,490
無分即係再無分一個性別噉樣去檢討嚇，咁誒我哋願意咧，當局咧係誒誒等佢一個整體嘅檢討，但係咧其實去年年底咧誒法律界嘅代表同我哋提出咧就係誒誒當局唔應該再等呢個檢討去完成先至去修訂相關嘅誒條文啦。

524
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:58,940
嚇咁誒有法律界嘅團體係提出，噉我哋都睇過律政司，亦都睇過咧，係覺得係應該係係應該係盡快去作出一個誒更新嘅嘅。

525
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:19,230
嘅修訂，因此我哋咧而家係去盡快做。咁頭先陳議員提到咧，誒除咗今次我哋更新咗幾條條文，誒係有涉及呢一個誒誒違憲嘅條文之外咧，有其他條文可能都有一啲唔同嘅處理方式，刑罰方面啊，或者涵蓋啊，或者一啲針對係誒同性。

526
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:39,240
嘅誒誒性行為啊等等嚇，噉我哋其實都同意咧，其實誒性罪行咧誒係需要一個全面嘅檢討，因此我哋都係誒有參與到法改會嗰個嘅嘅誒嗰個嘅討論，噉我哋就誒誒誒誒嗰個誒當法改會一個檢

527
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:55,050
檢討咧係有一個誒方向，有一個誒結果咧。咁當局咧係會盡快咧去考慮嘅嚇。我補充係咁多，多謝主席。好，佢係點咧？如果唔係就改一條至改一條嘅咯，即係大家未必等得切。好，我畀你問問呢個問題，因為時間已經過咗啦，係。

528
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:15,450
主席，誒法改會咧就住佢即係誒整項檢討嘅完成咧，誒佢哋都係一個即係誒盡快嘅，即係我理解，我唔能夠代表法改會啦。我我理解佢哋都係盡快去去做。噉佢哋係之前佢講過咧，係整個檢討，因為係好複雜，亦都要參考外國嘅好多嘅。

529
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:31,630
經驗噉佢哋會分四部分去做，噉佢哋就第一部分嘅諮詢文件已經出咗㗎啦，噉佢哋嚟緊咧就誒誒誒會做第二部分嚇，咁誒總共係有四部分嘅，咁誒但係我就冇佢哋即係一個確實嘅時間表嚇。

530
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:35,030
好，跟住係阿蔣麗雲議員。

531
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,330
唔該，主席。

532
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:42,110
嗯，即係我睇到嗰個《雜項》修訂嘅第六同埋第七咧。

533
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:49,940
即係我覺得，即係呢兩個係咪屬於，即係應該係唔屬於呢個技術技術性嘅修訂？

534
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:59,480
咁咧，即係儘管即係，我覺得即係，就儘管佢亦都唔係政策性嘅更改啊，但係肯定咧，我覺得係會唔會係比較爭議咧？

535
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:07,840
即係第六、第七呢兩樣嘢，即係而你將佢統一即係捆綁為集項修訂，係咪適合咧？咁？

536
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:18,620
即係因為即係我哋睇到，即係譬如話，你話只有律師或者外地律師可成為信託的受託人或共同受託人。

537
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:25,840
只是跟即係呢度呢度，即係假如你係正係話律師會嘅律師會議決。

538
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:45,530
噉嘅話，你即係我覺得誒，即係會唔會係即係我唔知有冇徵詢到其他嘅持份者嘅意見啊？嚇，即係我亦都即係奇怪，即係政府即係啊點解會同意就咁有關建議咧？就由律師會作出一個議決就得咧咁？

539
01:52:45,810 --> 01:53:05,820
咁另外咧就係啊，亦都有即係，譬如你話，附權律師會嘅理事會啦，可以撤銷或者恢復暫時吊銷律師嘅執執業資格，或者外地律師嘅註冊嘅安排噉，即係會涉涉及或者委託人啊，或者一般市民嘅利益咧。

540
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:21,110
即係咪亦都應該諮詢下呢個外界嘅意見咧？即係而唔應該咁簡單，即係捆綁咁納入咗呢一個嘅雜項修訂之內咧？好，政府有冇諮詢啊？誒。

541
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:41,400
多謝啊，蔣議員嘅誒問題。咁而喺十六十七段裏邊嗰個誒修訂建議咧，都係律師會提出啦。首先我解釋一下一九九七年嗰個關於受託人嗰個，其實而家個律師法團嗰啲條文都未生效嘅，即係儘管佢係一九九七年通過。

542
01:53:41,400 --> 01:54:01,410
但係而家我哋嗰啲律師行咧，都係仲未係可以以有限公司嘅誒形式咧係營業。咁即係話咧，依一集條文其實全部都未生效。咁根據現行嘅條例咧，其實嗰啲誒trust啊，即係嗰啲信託咧，如果你揾律師去做咧，

543
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:21,420
咗個誒trustee啊，受託人或者共同受託都其實只可以揾一個自然人去做，即係一個外地律師或者係一個本地嘅律師。咁所以其實佢而家律師會咧，佢可能係諗個啊，因為其實我哋喺兩年前咧係做過同類型嘅一個。

544
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:41,430
個《雜項修訂條例》咁當時咧就幫佢更新咗好多條文，因為啊九七年到而家都有十幾年咁誒。呢一個法律執業者條例裏邊咧有好多條文已經改咗，咁反而九七年嗰陣時過嗰啲修訂咧係夾唔到。咁喺嗰次咧，我哋發覺咧呢個問題。

545
01:54:41,430 --> 01:55:01,440
就同律師會講啊嘛，即係你哋係咪可以再諗一諗咧？究竟啊做trusty係咪可以適宜由一個公司有限公司嚟到做咧？咁一噉佢哋啊諗過之後咧，而家就係決定其實咧就唔改嘅啫，即係其實係用翻而家個條例噉，所以我哋喺我哋嘅立

546
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:21,450
長嚟講，既然而家嘅條例都已經喺嗰個法例裏邊又一路執行緊，咁所以我哋覺得咧，依一個都係誒唔係太大爭議性嘅嘅嘅一個修訂咯嚇。咁依個係第十六段所講，至於第十七段咧嗰個其實香香港嘅法律行業。

547
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:41,460
咧都係奉行依一個行業自管嘅，即係我哋係信任兩個律師專業嘅團體咧，去規管佢哋自己嘅律師嗰個行為。咁依個情況咧，就係當可能係有一啲誒律師啊被人哋投訴啦，嚇或者係顧客噉，咁誒律師公會咧就會成立依一個。

548
01:55:41,460 --> 01:56:01,470
紀律審裁處咧，係去即係調查啊，或者係誒詢問嗰個律師。咁喺依個過程裏邊咧，佢哋覺得誒有需要嘅話咧，可能係會暫時吊銷嗰個律師嘅執業資格，就等嗰個審裁處嘅最終嘅決定。咁但係而家佢誒，我哋佢哋提出咧，就係。

549
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:21,480
係，因為情況係可能千差萬別，每一個個案都唔同。咁可能有啲個案咧，的確又需要咧係啊，暫時撤銷嗰個誒所謂suspension，即係吊銷。咁但係我哋尊重咧呢一個誒律師係一個行業自管嘅呢一個原則咧，所以我哋都認為。

550
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:32,700
咧，因為整個過程其實都係佢哋嘅一個審誒記錄聆訊嘅過程，咁所以我哋係冇乜太大嘅異議咧，就同意有依一個權力啦，嚇。

551
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:37,340
好，誒，我諗就阿謝偉俊議員。

552
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:39,670
最近，嗯。

553
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:58,700
回應翻剛才秘書長嗰個最後個答案，有關律師行業嗰個咧執業者條例嗰度咧，我就唔係好知道你講嗰個話係誒一般嘅幾六零上咩？因為八大組A咧，似乎係針對一啲嘅數嘅問題。我唔知，或者因為而家八A已經有喺度，但係你哋想改係點改法？

554
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:01,160
係政府。

555
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,450
聽見未？

556
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:04,560
但係而家比較堅。

557
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:08,650
誒嗱，因為我哋嗰個。

558
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:27,110
法律條文嘅草擬而家係未進入定稿個階段㗎，咁即係我哋都係仲係諮詢緊一個律師會，即係對嗰個法律條文草案。但係我哋主要喺呢度咧，係就嗰個政策咧，我哋想徵詢議員嘅意見，就係如果佢而家已經係有一個誒。

559
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:32,920
暫時吊銷律師執業資格同埋即係註冊嗰啲，但係依個所謂執。

560
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:53,210
誒暫時吊銷都係一個暫時嘅啫嘛，即係佢唔係等到依一個聆訊出咗嚟，即係你你要成個聆訊嗰個紀律審裁處完曬個程序咧，你先至最後可能可能係取消嗰個嚇律師嘅執業資格添。最終係嘛？如果係嚴重嘅情況，或者個律。

561
01:57:53,210 --> 01:58:09,550
先唔滿意可以上訴啦，依個係一個程序。但係而家我哋講緊嘅咧，都係喺依個聆訊有結果之前咧，嗰個誒律師會或者係誒佢覺得可能為咗保障公眾利益咧，佢需要暫時吊銷，即係suspend佢practice pending嗰個。

562
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:29,840
裁標奴嘅最終嘅決定噉，咁而家佢要求嘅係一個權力咧，就係誒撤銷嘅暫時吊銷，即係可能畀佢繼續執業啦，直至到最後嘅聆訊。咁依個裏邊可能誒，我哋我哋問過佢有冇一啲誒噉樣嘅需要係咩？噉佢佢提供過一個例子就係。

563
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,570
可能嗰個律師係啊，畀人刑事起訴緊啦。

564
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:47,830
咁而最後咧又被誒中間係出現撤銷嘅刑事起訴，噉佢覺得咧係噉嘅情況之下咧係無需要暫時吊銷佢嗰個執業資格，咁所以佢要求咧係有依一個權利噉樣。

565
01:58:48,110 --> 01:59:08,120
係，鄭慧靜議員。問題嘅核心咧就唔係話律師會有冇權佢臨時撤銷，或者好似而家呢度講咧就即係可以撤銷後又即係可以又再復復牌，跟住又再撤銷翻，即係玩嚟玩去都可以噉樣。而家問題唔係嗰個問題就係八大A咧係講一啲特別嘅情況，就係關於嗰啲數嘅問題出現咗，或者身體上有問題咧，論論至有關嘅。

566
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:28,130
律師唔能夠繼續執業咧，先行使八A就唔係一般嘅任何記錄聆訊，好似影張相啊，或者影啊或者賣廣告啊嗰啲，即係我都舐過呢啲嚇，試過呢啲嘢，就唔係講嗰一種嘅，而家係講啲好嚴格嘅情況之下嘅噉。秘書長，你咪睇先文件先答我問題咯，定還是你隨便噏噏就算數？係秘書長或者其他嘅代表。

567
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:28,550
嗯。

568
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:31,500
嗯。

569
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:51,790
多謝謝議員嘅提問。嗯，其實咧，根據我哋嘅解讀咧，八A其實佢係涉及咗好多情況啦，好似啊謝議員頭先都有提過，包括佢有冇能力去繼續執業啦，或者佢嘅財政狀況啊，或者佢有冇刑事嘅記錄啊等等。咁所以咧，其實佢係一個比較闊嘅一個條文嚟嘅。咁所以我哋即係聽。

570
01:59:51,790 --> 02:00:11,800
律師會所講就話係一個咁闊嘅條文咧，佢哋希望唔好一刀切，同埋佢哋都有參考過英國咧。其實佢都有啲相類似嘅條文咧，佢係畀翻喺當佢考慮係唔係一個律師係唔適合執業嘅時候咧，就唔一定要即時停咗佢嗰個執業嘅，因為始終都影響嗰個律師嘅生計噉樣啦。咁所以考慮過英國嘅情。

571
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:31,810
司會有呢個建議，噉我哋同事考慮過之後，亦都覺得其實真係可以喺呢個條文裏面考慮加入一個即係同樣嘅一個元素落去噉樣咯。係對唔住，我希望剛才冇即係太過冒犯即係秘書長啦。但係我因為我擔心你答嗰陣時，你完全係真係冇睇過嗰個條文。你雖然未有具體嘅條文啦，但係其實嗰個嗰個政策原意應該清。

572
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:51,820
所知道嘅範圍，因為我擔心嘅就係你哋唔能夠好似剛才阿張文麗議員講，即係律師會話點，你哋就點。因為上你哋嘅公眾，你係要保護嘅，因為尤其是都係誒。雖然我哋而家喺監管行業就畀咗權好大大權畀律師會，但係事實上咧，你哋作為一個政府機關，更加需要去監管呢一樣嘢。所以如果唔能夠律師會話要乜，你就要乜。

573
02:00:51,820 --> 02:01:02,640
相反咧，我覺得咧，你哋可能要考慮下律師會咁多個行業裏邊咧，唯一個咧仲係可以閉門聆訊嘅，係唔可以選擇呢個所謂公開聆訊呢樣嘢咧？你哋有咪適當時候都檢討下咧？

574
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:07,000
係，誒謝遠，我哋我哋會誒出。

575
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:20,740
係充分考慮公眾利益嘅，咁誒至於具體嗰個條文點樣修訂咧，我哋誒我即係如果係有法案委員會嘅情況下，我哋可以具體噉樣仔細去睇下。係，仲有冇委員想發言？

576
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:41,200
係啊，蔣麗雲議員係啊，誒，我都唔係好嗱，我就唔係好識嘅啦，在座佢好多法律嘅人士喺度啦嚇。我哋其實好多議員，不過我只係覺得就係我我搞清楚啫，就係你嗰個第十六條嗰度咧，都係講翻信託人，即係咁而家你改咗修訂咗之後。

577
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:54,120
嘅話咧，咁咧就誒信託公司係咪就唔可以做到信託人咧？請問，係蔣麗雲議員係第二輪，我哋畀翻三分鐘。好啊，唔該，秘書長。

578
02:01:55,680 --> 02:02:15,690
根據而家嗰個誒法律執業者條例咧，如果係有一啲即係誒信託嘅，佢涉及信託嘅條文裏邊咧，佢嗰個受託人，因為而家係未有誒公司啊嘛，即係冇一個有限公司形式嘅律師行，所以佢只係由一個人，即係一係一個本地律。

579
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:35,700
律師或者外地律師咧，係出任依一個誒一個信託人咯。咁依個誒考慮翻嗰個情況咧，可能唔係好適宜咧，係由一個以有限公司形式誒執業嘅律師行嚟到係做依啲即係誒誒信託人，但係其實。

580
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:49,490
其實我哋係冇改過嗰條條文嘅，即係所有嘅具體條文喺其他範圍裏邊都係冇冇改到嘅，嚇！而家只係講翻咧，保持翻現行嘅條文嗰個情況。

581
02:02:49,770 --> 02:03:09,780
好誒，我諗咧就誒都同大家指出翻啦。政府呢一次嘅提交畀我哋嘅誒建議咧，都係希望我哋嘅委員會係只係就住政策同埋原則上作討論。咁頭先秘書長都講咧，佢哋喺技術上嘅一啲啊～

582
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:29,790
誒建議咧，其實都未曾去到最後階段。不過我自己本人咧，亦都係希望咧，係誒同政府當局建議咧，就係誒真係避免咧咁多嘅條例，無論佢係技術上或者政策上，一次過拎上嚟。第一咧，委員要去誒。

583
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:49,800
去表達意見咧，亦都咧係有困難嘅嚇。咁誒，其實誒呢一樣嘢係都涉及公眾利益㗎。譬如誒，當然我自己本人，你頭先提到建築物條例可以嗰啲嘅法團係誒用書面申報，噉我覺得即係我本人覺得呢個係好嘅。噉你如果改咗之後，其實你係應該。

584
02:03:49,800 --> 02:04:09,810
盡早，甚至你而家未正式係生效之前咧，應該已經係喺即係地區，因為去到最基層，佢知道原來啊，遲啲有呢個改變。即係其實呢一啲嘢係應該係同步進行，所以我真係建議咧，下一次真係唔好咧係等埋咁多嘅修訂，雖然可能。

585
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:29,820
你哋認為係一啲技術性嘅修訂咧，一次過即係等埋噉樣嚟到委員會。其實我哋係好歡迎咧，你哋係誒比較合理嘅數目，譬如兩到三個修訂你拎上嚟，我哋有一個比較合理嘅討論，甚至可能會畀到一啲更更好嘅建議畀你哋。咁希望你哋可以聽到。咁咧就。

586
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:45,760
誒嗱，頭先阿梁國洪議員舉咗手，噉我好唔好畀埋梁國洪議員去誒誒表達咗佢嘅意見？噉啊，問答五分鐘，因為佢係第一輪嘅，噉我哋就結束呢一個議題嘅討論。哦，最好啦，快啲翻屋企瞓覺啦～

587
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:52,970
呢個呢個項目仲有一個項目，知道知道。嗱，我就想誒請教啲官員咧，就係。

588
02:04:53,410 --> 02:05:04,240
即係關於誒，正話阿陳志全議員講話，即係法改會嗰個問題，你話佢即係會盡快，咁而家出緊第一部分嘅諮詢，咁有四個部分。

589
02:05:04,610 --> 02:05:07,760
咁到底佢有冇日程表嘅咧？即係話誒。

590
02:05:08,230 --> 02:05:18,560
佢會幾時做完，同埋係咪四個部分係一定係相連？即係話咧誒，缺一不可。即係話做完第一個先做第二個、第三個、第四個，有個因果關係。

591
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,990
係咪噉樣嘅咧？

592
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:25,310
因為你等好耐啊嘛，秘書長或者其他代表，道安局好。

593
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:27,280
有。

594
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,830
多謝兩議員嘅提問。

595
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:32,060
咁如果話佢哋，

596
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:40,920
如果話嗰個誒法改會嗰個即係誒時間表，我我呢一個誒。

597
02:05:42,100 --> 02:06:02,110
誒問題咧，我都要轉即係轉去發改會嗰度睇下佢哋有冇一個回應。但係我瞭解咧，佢哋都係想盡快，因為其實上一次佢哋出第一輪嘅報告咧，其實好多團體啊或者誒誒立法會啊好多議員都係希望佢哋盡早去去做，所以其實佢哋都諗緊點樣再去壓縮整個嘅。

598
02:06:02,110 --> 02:06:22,120
嘅誒誒圖，即係嗰個研究嘅。噉佢哋其實誒有有四個部分嘅。我我知道佢哋整個研究第一部分，佢哋出咗諮詢文件咧，就係以性自主權為依據嘅罪行，即係話嗰個誒誒誒誒誒強姦啦，同埋其他未經同意誒下進行嘅性罪行。噉佢喺上一期已經已經係出。

599
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:40,100
諮詢文件噉佢下一期咧，第二部分咧就係以保護原則為依據嘅罪行。保護原則即係話啲侵犯兒童啦、誒精神上冇行為能力誒人士嘅罪行啦，以及涉及咧濫用受信任地位嘅罪行嚇。咁即係呢個牽涉到咧嗰個誒同意嗰個年齡啦，同意嘅年齡。

600
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:49,020
咁第三部分咧就係集行性嘅誒性罪行，同埋第四部分咧就係頭先陳議員都提到嗰個量刑嗰個誒penalty嗰樣嘢。

601
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,920
咁所以佢哋係誒誒。

602
02:06:52,200 --> 02:07:02,550
結構咧就係噉樣四部分去做嘅研究，咁但係佢哋誒實際嘅時間表，我理解佢哋係冇，即係未，我我就唔要要要再去。

603
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:04,440
正信決定。

604
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,730
佢會做幾耐？

605
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:08,150
公。

606
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:10,290
係咪噉嘅意思？

607
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:14,250
冇噉嘅資料係，噉我睇上嚟誒。

608
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:22,860
即係除咗兩，即係兩年，佢係都同上上誒同呢個頭嗰兩樣有有關係啦，咁但係。

609
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:24,120
點解？

610
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:29,760
唔可以做完一行又一行，因為你誒性自主權同埋保護兩樣嘢。

611
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:40,280
因為我我記得佢拎過嚟嘅關於強姦嗰個，即係我哋都辯論咗好耐啦。即係如果改改完改改就，即係如果改咗難告啲，即係難好難告得入啊噉樣樣。

612
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:46,000
即係我哋講都差唔多幾個月㗎嘞喎，咁點解會咁慢咧？係係。

613
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:52,420
點解會改革得咁慢？因為呢個呢個問題係一個影響人哋。

614
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:56,140
即係影響人哋其他人嘅權利，好深遠嘅。

615
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:00,230
江秘書長，你未改之前都有效嘅嘛？係咪？

616
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:04,780
你唔係要人哋告到你失效先得，先得係咪啊？

617
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:26,430
主席啊，多謝梁議員嘅提問嚇。咁其實我我自己都有參與喺嗰個小組嗰個討論裡面。咁誒，其實嗰個小組咧係非常之認真嘅，做嗰個研究。咁個小組有誒誒誒有有法官係做委員啦，亦都有誒學者啦，等等等啦噉樣。

618
02:08:26,430 --> 02:08:46,440
都有政府部門嘅代表啊，咁誒，因為其實係非常之複雜，咁亦都要係睇好多外國嘅嘅最新嘅發展，噉佢哋做嘅研究咧就係誒好好全面，咁因為每一條咧都誒嗰個影響好大，咁亦都佢哋嘅研究咧，正如我頭先所講，佢係根據幾個。

619
02:08:46,440 --> 02:09:06,450
指導原則係同而家刑事罪行條例裏邊嗰個方向咧，係完全係係唔一樣嘅。咁變咗，佢哋都要考慮翻而家呢啲法條文嘅執行啊。外國佢哋嘅改革點解佢噉樣改啊？英國又唔係噉樣改，誒另一個地方又係噉樣改，噉佢哋就要研究並且有時要寫。

620
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:25,160
翻翻去當地嗰個嗰個嗰個地區嗰度問佢點解你會當時噉樣去寫你嘅條文咧？咁變咗其實佢哋真係做緊一個好仔細嘅嘅功夫。咁正如我頭先講啦，佢哋其實喺第一期推出諮詢文件嘅時候，已經係聽到誒議員嘅意見咧，係睇下點樣可以再壓縮佢哋嗰個工作㗎。

621
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:29,970
點咧？即係到底係有冇有冇個期限咧？

622
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:44,700
即係，江秘書長，誒，即係唔好意思畀出，因為我我哋監察你咧，就係話你要畀一個合理嘅誒時限咧。我明我明係好複雜，都係好複雜啦，係咪？噉佢。

623
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:46,540
點解要咁耐啊？

624
02:09:47,040 --> 02:10:00,950
因為你而家係而家係而家，我聽落咧，除咗係第四項係容易啲之外咧，其其實啊，集項都容易啲啦。可能係咪一個技術嘅問題？噉你頭嗰兩項係好龐大嘅工程嚟嘅，你你。

625
02:10:02,150 --> 02:10:03,260
江秘書長。

626
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:23,860
主席咁或者我誒可以將議員嘅提問帶翻去法改會，即係睇下佢哋係咪有一個嘅回應。咁但係咧，至於誒點解佢哋做咁耐咧？或者我都都都要一個補充資料。其實咧，呢個小組咧喺零六零七年嘅時候已經成立㗎。噉佢哋咧誒原本咧係係要誒。

627
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:43,870
誒誒即即刻就進行一個全面性嘅性向嘅檢討，咁但係當時咧係有一啲嘅案例咧係睇到咧嗰啲兒童咧係受到一啲誒誒誒一啲受受信任嘅地位嘅人嘅嘅侵犯，咁因此佢哋咧誒當時覺得咧有一啲法官就喺個判詞度指。

628
02:10:43,870 --> 02:11:03,880
出誒香港冇一個機制咧去保護呢啲嘅小朋友，咁因此佢哋咧就用咗誒都有幾年嘅時間咧去做一個誒誒性罪行定罪記錄嗰個查核。咁其實佢哋一一一年誒一零年出報告咧，保安局咧一一年咧已經即刻係實施咗㗎啦。咁所以佢哋係做完嗰個誒。

629
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:23,890
查下機制咧，先至翻翻去咧，就做翻一個嘅研究。咁所以其實佢哋有幾年嘅時間係做咗嗰嗰樣嘢。咁但係梁議員頭先嗰個問題，我帶翻去法改會睇下佢哋一個回覆。好噉，麻煩阿江秘書長幫我哋誒跟進呢個問題，因為譬如就住強姦呢一類性罪行，有啲係咪要更改？

630
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:43,900
改啊！所以我哋喺委員會咧，其實都有討論過嘅。咁誒，議員嘅意見咧，你哋都聽到。咁咧，我都要問一問各位委員咧，誒喺誒呢一係列嘅即係政府交上嚟嘅一啲修訂嘅建議咧，誒，我要問下委員咧係是否支持當局向立法會提交？

631
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:46,200
有關嘅條例草案。

632
02:11:46,600 --> 02:12:06,610
誒誒，如果係大家都喺呢個階段誒冇反對咧，噉我哋係係同意你哋交上去。但係頭先委員提出嘅意見，希望你哋係誒吸取嘅，好嘛？咁多謝誒政府嘅代表係嚟呢度為我哋提供嘅意見。咁跟住我哋咧就係進入下一個項目議程係各。

633
02:12:06,610 --> 02:12:26,620
級法院嘅司法人手情況，同埋咧係長時間嘅法院案件輪候時間。咁咧就立法會提供嘅文件係C.B.括弧四二二五stock十三-hyphen十四括弧零五，就係當局提供嘅文件。仲有咧就係C.B.括弧。

634
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:46,630
四二二五足十三-hyphen十四括弧零六就係立法會秘書處而備有關各級法院嘅司法人手情況同埋怎長嘅法院案件輪候時間嘅背景資料簡介。咁咧就誒，亦都順便同大家報告一下咧，本委員會。

635
02:12:46,630 --> 02:13:06,640
亦都喺十二月三號係參觀個司法機構，亦都有機會咧直接同中審法院首席法官馬道立大法官咧就呢個議題咧係交換個意見嘅。咁而家咧，我哋先請司法機構政務長劉煙華女士向本委員會簡。

636
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,830
界有關嘅文件。

637
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:12,700
噉啊，首先係劉政務長。

638
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:16,530
係。

639
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:20,140
誒，多謝主席。

640
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:22,400
嗯。

641
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:28,580
我哋咧就已經係啊提交咗一份文件，就係啊。

642
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:45,070
都詳細去講述咗，即係兩個好重要嘅議題，就係有關司法人手同埋輪候時間嘅問題。或者我呃要咁講一講喺司法人手方邊咧，我哋喺兩方邊咧係作出一啲嘅啊彙報嘅。

643
02:13:45,350 --> 02:14:03,090
第一方面咧，就係講到喺過去嘅時間，司法機構係去作出公開招聘人手，去填補一啲嘅空缺。咁喺呢一個方面嚟講咧，我哋有提到過去嘅工作同埋未來嘅工作。

644
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:23,410
誒過去嘅工作，我哋特別指出，即係喺由二零一一一二年中開始進嘅一輪嘅招聘工作嘅裏邊咧。誒，直至到我哋係係誒今年嘅十二月一號為止咧，經公開招聘咧喺國級法院咧，我哋係招聘咗四十九位嘅法官同埋。

645
02:14:23,410 --> 02:14:24,460
司法人員。

646
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:44,820
噉就而新一輪嘅招聘工作咧，亦都已經係計劃同埋展開啦。咁喺呢一度，我想係特別提出兩點嘅。第一點就係中審法院首席法官咧，佢經過考慮之後咧，就發覺特別喺高等法院原訟法官嘅情況嘅時候咧，好多。

647
02:14:44,820 --> 02:15:04,830
時候，如果係要係喺業界嘅大律師或者係考慮，即係係到到司法機構擔任呢一方面嘅職位嘅時候咧，嗰個時間性咧係一個好重要嘅考慮嘅。咁誒有莫有咁於我哋以前咧作出呢一啲嘅招聘嘅工作咧，好多時候係三。

648
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:24,840
三年先做一次，咁所以好多時候我哋可能嘅招聘嘅時間表咧，同埋誒呢啲執業嘅人士佢哋考慮入司法機構嘅時間咧，亦都未必係相符。咁有見及此咧，就首席法官咧就係已經係決定咗咧，就係由今年開始咧，我哋會差唔多一年度咧就會作出招。

649
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:44,850
評咁希望用咗呢一個嘅策略咧，就能夠更加咧係可以係吸納更多嘅人係加入司法機構。而另外一方邊咧，我哋喺文件裏邊都係介紹咗咧，啊，除咗係原眾法庭，我哋會有更加密嘅招聘工作咧，我哋亦都會將作喺來年二零一。

650
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:51,270
四年第一季咧，就會係喺上任裁判官同埋特委裁判官嗰度咧，係作出招聘嘅。

651
02:15:51,660 --> 02:16:05,590
咁所以呢一個就係人手嗰個招聘同埋填補空缺方面嘅彙報。第二方面嘅彙報咧，就有關編制嘅檢討啦。噉我哋嘅文件亦都交代咗過去嘅工作同埋未未來嘅工作。

652
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:19,330
誒過去嘅工作咧，我哋喺過去五年嘅裏邊，由二零零八到一三咧，我哋嘅司法各級嘅職位咧係增加咗十一個，係由一百二去到嗯一九三。

653
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:35,450
咁而喺今年嘅誒誒嘅年中開始嘅時候，誒今年嘅年頭嘅時候咧，終審法院首席法官咧，亦都係喺做咗上一輪嘅招聘工作之後咧，將對於我哋法院嘅人手需要作咗一個全面嘅檢討。

654
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:56,210
呢個檢視咧嘅結果咧，主要係兩方面嘅個結果。第一咧就係我哋發覺係嗯，我哋喺特別喺高等法院上訴法庭嗰方面咧，係司法嘅資源咧係需要增加。嗰個原因咧就係話，其實我哋上訴法庭嘅法官咧已經嘅空缺咧已經全部。

655
02:16:56,210 --> 02:17:09,970
已經由實任法官填補啦，但喺噉嘅情況之下，仍然我哋嘅案件嘅壓力好大，嘅輪候時間仍然都係比較長，仍然咧要好大量藉助袁仲庭法官額外嘅人手去幫手。

656
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:30,260
咁所以咧，經過檢討之後咧，我哋就發覺咧係上訴法庭嘅司法人員嘅資源咧需要增加。另外一方面，我哋亦都檢視咗各級法院嗰個人手嘅情況，發覺亦都係需要增加一啲嘅司法嘅資源，而咧係去更。

657
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:35,140
更加進一步咧，去強化強化司法培訓方面嘅需要。

658
02:17:36,470 --> 02:17:51,410
咁喺一個人手短期人手司法人手比較緊張，同埋係喺嗯案件亦都有趨複雜嘅情況之下咧，我哋咧亦都係睇到嗰個案件嘅輪候時間嗰個嘅趨勢係點樣樣啦。

659
02:17:51,830 --> 02:18:06,820
喺嗰個文件裏邊咧，啊，我哋都交代咗。一般嚟講咧，除咗喺高等法院以外，其他各級嘅法院咧，一般嚟講嗰個輪候時間咧，都能夠係係好接近目標，或者係係低過目標嘅。

660
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:10,320
咁最大嘅壓力嘅範圍就係高等法院啦。

661
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:30,750
咁喺高等法院方邊咧，我哋最主要咧就係喺呢個短期嘅人手緊缺嘅情況底下咧，啊，除咗我哋係盡量去調配短期嘅司法人員嘅資源去幫助去係啊改善輪候時間咧，我都想喺呢度特別去提出喺派期。

662
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:50,760
方便根據法官嘅指示咧，我哋亦都係作出咗啲嘅措施，將優先次序咧係畀一啲需要優先處理嘅案件，以致到咧即係嗰個輪候時間嘅誒誒嘅嘅影響咧係比較上咧係減低。咁有邊幾類係？

663
02:18:50,760 --> 02:19:10,770
係根據法官嘅指示咧，係要有優先嘅處理啦。就文件都交代咗，第一咧就係刑事上訴嘅案件，咁所以大家睇到咧，縱使我哋人手緊缺，仍然喺刑事上訴案件嘅輪候時間咧，係盡量維持接近翻目標時間。第二方面係裁判法。

664
02:19:10,770 --> 02:19:21,370
院嘅上訴案件，呢個亦都係我哋優先次序嘅案件，咁所以亦都係盡量將個輪候時間咧係維持咧接近翻喺嗰個嘅輪候嘅目標嘅。

665
02:19:21,650 --> 02:19:41,660
咁最後咧，亦都有啲特別性質嘅案件，係根據佢哋嘅性質啦。如果係有時間嘅需要，係需要優先處理咧，亦都按照法官嘅指示咧，喺排期方面咧係優先處理嘅。甚至有陣時咧，佢哋嘅處理嘅時間係會低過我哋嘅目標嘅輪候時間。

666
02:19:41,660 --> 02:20:01,670
咁呢個就係我哋短期嘅措施，去處理現時高等法院嗰個嘅工作量。但係長遠嚟講咧，司法機構喺文件裏邊交代得好清楚，我哋係需要係嗯增加我哋司法人手嘅編制，並且繼續咧係去持續噉樣去努力做，即係公開招聘嘅工。

667
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:07,510
工作，以致到呢啲職位可以填補，而係長遠咧能夠即係再啊。

668
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:26,120
改善呢一個輪候時間嘅，我簡單嘅介紹嚟到呢一度主席。好好多謝啊，劉政務長。咁咧就誒，而家就請委員發問。噉我首先想大家示意咧，誒暫時我係有兩位委員舉咗手發問嘅。

669
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:31,520
三位啊，咁咧我就每一位而家先係。

670
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:37,390
好，四位，我每一位係畀四分鐘時間，先請田北辰議員。

671
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:40,160
主席。

672
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:52,370
我哋香港嘅呢個完善、公平、公正而又畀人印象非常之獨立嘅司法機制咧，係我哋嘅核心價值啊，主席啊！

673
02:20:52,650 --> 02:20:58,390
噉啊，好多人中意住香港，噉啊，外商又中意香港做生意，都係因為呢一樣嘢。

674
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:07,710
咁但係，國級誒法院嗰個人手短缺問題咧，好嚴重。文件都話咧，去到今年月初咧，有成十七個percent空缺。

675
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:11,530
十七個percent空缺係一個幾高嘅一個比例。

676
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:17,390
噉我哋早前啊，法會議員咧都見過，即係探訪過呢個馬道立首席法官啊。

677
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:32,910
問起佢呢個問題，噉佢就解釋咧話，因為要質素保證，所以唔係個個都可以升得做法官。咁跟住我哋問佢，噉你喺外地招聘係點咧？噉佢話有時都會有啲語言嘅。

678
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:44,290
嘅考慮啊，剩啊噉，同埋外地都唔係咁容易招編到。咁即係話咧，睇富養嗰十七個percent空缺咧，都係一啲見唔到曙光嘅一個一個問題嚟嘅。

679
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:51,110
咁今日文件第五段咧，就係解決問題咧。我哋會聘用一啲調配一啲站位法官啊。

680
02:21:51,580 --> 02:22:08,280
係嘛？噉我先知道啦。你啲站位法官應該係屬於誒馬道立首席法官話嘅高質素嘅人士啦嚇。咁但係佢哋事實上又唔想放棄佢自己嘅事業，走去做一個法官嘅。

681
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:28,570
咁只會唯一個方法咧，長遠計咧就係多啲凝聚呢啲即係高質素嘅司法人士去做呢啲站位法官。咁但係政府有咩誒政策咧策略去遊説多啲人參加呢個行業咧？因為你想增加人手填補空缺，你係提出種種嘅問題，又睇。

682
02:22:28,570 --> 02:22:41,290
唔到有啲咩嘅方法應變，咁市場上可能有好多呢類人才，咁點樣要令到多啲人喺三個月啦、六個月啦一段時間嚟做暫委法官？我想聽下政府有冇啲咩嘅？

683
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:42,870
基準。

684
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:54,680
另外咧就仲有，你經濟事務審裁處就成立咗，今日開始又要加人手啦。上次法官同我哋講咧，就係根本你地方都係一個問題。

685
02:22:54,960 --> 02:23:05,260
嚇！你根本辦公室又唔夠，噉你法庭又唔係好夠喎，噉你將來再加埋呢啲嘅話咧，其實呢呢兩方面都變咗個問題嘅。

686
02:23:05,540 --> 02:23:20,380
即係你填補咗啲空缺再加人咧，你肯定地方有問題。咁呢方面政府有冇配合到你哋嘅訴求？真係已經同你哋開始揾地方啊？可能畀多啲法庭嘅地方，你或者啲法官嘅辦公室咧噉。

687
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:22,330
好，司法機構。

688
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:42,710
係，謝務長。多謝主席，多謝誒田議員嘅問題。咁首先就係喺我哋誒嗰個招聘嘅工作啦。其實喺過去我哋一路去公開招聘嘅時候咧，不斷都係有喺外界嘅執業嘅人士加入司法機構嘅。咁即係正如我頭先所講咧，喺過。

689
02:23:42,710 --> 02:24:02,720
我去嗰個輪嘅招聘咧，到誒今年嘅十二一號有四十九位，咁其中有二十幾位咧都係外界執業嘅人士加入司法機構工作嘅。咁當然佢哋考慮加入司法機構工作嘅裏邊係一個好慎重嘅考慮，特別對於區域法院法官誒法官以上嘅。

690
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:22,730
嘅人士咧，因為呢一方面咧，佢哋係需要有一個承諾，就如果加入咗司法機構做法官咧，佢就啊，如果唔得到特首嘅許可咧，係唔會唔可以翻返去私人嘅職業嘅。而咁耐以嚟咧，亦都冇畀過呢個許可。咁所以呢一個係一個十分之長遠一個好重要嘅決定。

691
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:42,890
咁所以係經過好審慎嘅考慮，咁所以我哋係一路咧係繼續會吸納人手。咁呢個第一點。咁第二咧就係喺嗰個站位法官裏邊咧，其實誒首席法官都有解釋，都係需要咧係有適合嘅人士，有足夠嘅專業嘅才能資格咧，佢會考慮咧係係去。

692
02:24:42,890 --> 02:25:02,900
誒誒誒誒委任嘅咁呢一方面咧，首席法官咧喺過去咁多年咧都係不斷嘅去物識，亦都係咧，我哋一路咧都係有唔同嘅誒執業嘅人士咧係加入嚟司法機構嗰度咧係試做暫委法官嘅。咁其實個數字咧，我哋喺文件嘅第十八段咧，亦都係有。

693
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:22,910
有交代，咁呢個咧就同田議員所講，我哋會繼續係誒會物色係適合嘅人咧，係係出任誒就審法官。第至於嗰個嘅第三嗰個嘅問題咧，就係講到誒我哋都同議員介紹咧，喺短期嘅時候喺司法機構咧會設立一個競爭事務審。

694
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:42,920
審裁處咁呢個競爭事務審裁處嘅設立咧，我哋都增加咗司法人手同埋其他職員嘅人手。阿展如講得好好啱，我哋係需要額外嘅地方，需要額外嘅法庭。咁喺呢一方面，司法機構已經將我哋嘅需要咧係好清楚噉樣去交畀咗交咗誒。

695
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:52,210
畀行政機關去考慮，而我哋亦都知道佢係積極噉樣處理緊我哋嗰個嘅需要。我哋已經將我哋嘅需要講得好清楚畀佢哋聽㗎啦。

696
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:54,260
我唔畀你哋。

697
02:25:54,610 --> 02:26:08,400
啊！佢哋而家係積極處理緊，我哋瞭解佢都係好積極噉樣，係有一啲啊，好積極係有一啲有啲方案做緊。好，我哋畀其他議員問完先下，我哋都仲可以跟進係，跟住係啊，郭榮亨議員。

698
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:15,220
誒，其實我哋聽到嗰個資源同人手短缺呢個問題咧，其實都真係好耐，大家都其實。

699
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:35,510
誒連阿馬道立大法官，佢都認為大家都知道呢個問題好嚴重。咁所以即係誒嗱，我我都明白你請高等法院法官係有佢嘅難度喺度嘅。咁但係有啲嘢咧，我哋係可以誒未雨綢繆嘅，譬如好似法庭嗰個嘅。

700
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:52,380
啊，本身法庭嘅數目啦，嗱，你話誒喺西九龍嗰個就嚟會完成啦嚇，咁但係高等法院咧，就算你請到而家高等法院更多法官嘅話，你擺佢哋喺邊咧？呢啲你哋有冇諗定？我想問第一條嚇。

701
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:54,800
係，主席。

702
02:26:55,480 --> 02:27:15,490
有冇諗定？多謝主席，多謝貴院嘅問題。誒，我哋而家嘅空缺，我哋要填補嘅法官空缺咧。如果係能夠實任填補咧，係有足夠嘅法庭同埋誒誒辦公室咧，係去畀佢哋辦公。即係而家高等法院，如果你請埋嗰七個都仲有位嘅，係啊係。O K，咁如果。

703
02:27:15,490 --> 02:27:35,500
誒，第時再有計劃係誒，因為而家其實高等法院嘅法官嘅工作量咧，相比起其他嘅誒司法管轄區都係較高嘅。咁所以好好好可能咧，就算你請曬嗰七個咧，都係唔夠人再要請嘅。咁誒，如果未來高等法院嗰個誒法

704
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:42,190
發展同埋佢而家嗰啲設施咧開始舊啦，噉你哋會唔會抌多啲資源落去起一啲新嘅法院咧？

705
02:27:42,810 --> 02:27:43,990
係，謝務長。

706
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:45,860
誒。

707
02:27:46,140 --> 02:28:06,150
多謝主席，多謝議員嘅問題。喺高等法院嗰個嘅情況咧，就係我哋都係已經現時係儘量嘅去改善佢嘅資源。噉我哋過去做咗嘅工作咧，就係我哋改建咗高等法院嘅地下低層四樓，加建咗三個法庭。但係當時我哋做嘅

708
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:26,160
嘅時候咧，已經係我諗，相信係誒唯一一個我哋已經諗到一個幾幾幾誒，即係可以做嘅方案啦。咁而嚟年一個短期嘅工作就我頭先提到咧，就係我哋同政府講咗，我哋希望有額外嘅地方做嗰個競爭誒事務審裁處嗰度，我哋係要求多兩個法庭同。

709
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:46,170
埋即係有其他配套嘅法官同埋司法人員嘅辦公室同埋其他嘅設施，希望呢一方面嘅配套咧，亦都去幫助到。咁至於長遠嗰個需要，我哋咧就喺首席法官咧就需要喺佢嘅指導之下，我哋要再要從長計議。我希望喺今年嘅施政報告咧，即係我自己都係噉。

710
02:28:46,170 --> 02:29:03,370
咁同誒誒特首反映嘅就係嗰個司法機關嘅資源咧，係需要更多嚇更充分。咁同埋最後一點咧，我就想問咧，就係你文件呢個講到嘅就係嗰個誒誒judicial assistant嗰度，即係嗰個司法人員誒誒。

711
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:23,660
嗰個啊，即係輔助、輔手嗰度嗰個，嗰樣嘢其實誒誒，好多法官都講就話其實好誒，有可能係真係好有用嘅嚇，好幫到佢哋嗰個工工工作量啊等等，而對年輕嘅律師嚟講，亦個好好嘅工作機會。誒，我希望你會考慮啦，因為你。

712
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:43,670
睇翻其實過去嗰四年嚟都係得個五個、三個、三個、五個噉樣，個數量係非常之少。其實有好有空間咧，係大大去擴大呢個judicial assistant，即係呢個副手嘅一個計劃嘅。噉我希望你會考慮擴大，而第二咧係就算你請唔夠法官。

713
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:47,930
嘅話，起碼啲法官都能夠有足夠嘅支援咯，嚇。

714
02:29:48,240 --> 02:30:02,720
好，誒，謝務長，多謝主席，多謝各位議員嘅誒提問。其實嗰個司法助理計劃，我哋都好同意係一個好有用、好成功嘅計劃。咁其實我哋嘅目標咧，其實我哋係想請六個嘅。

715
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:23,010
咁但係喺過去四年嘅裏邊咧，但係亦都誒法官咧，亦都係由法官組成嘅遴選委員會去聘請嘅。咁但係我哋都覺得係要適合嘅人士去聘請。咁所以有陣時咧，佢哋結果都可能係只係揾到三個至五個適合嘅人手。但係如果有適合嘅人手，我哋想請六個。咁所以喺呢一個計劃裏邊咧，就我哋都。

716
02:30:23,010 --> 02:30:34,440
都文件交代咧，中審法院首席法官咧，佢係親自去審視呢個計劃。我哋會一路去密切，即係睇下發展要點樣，呢個計劃要再點樣發展。好，梁家恆議員。

717
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:42,670
嗰個助理嘅問題啦，即係我我而家我即係下即係二月都要投訴。

718
02:30:42,950 --> 02:30:48,980
即係啲法官叫個離案官幫佢睇下啲case啊！啊，主席都知啦，係咪啊？就係馬道林。

719
02:30:51,220 --> 02:30:55,800
如果你唔係，你唔行呢個制度嘅，你始終都係揾人做嘢。不過你就，

720
02:30:56,080 --> 02:31:05,260
即係唔跟制度啫嘛？誒老友啲嘅或者大家啱傾啲嘅，你幫我睇睇佢嘅噉樣。但係嗰個法嗰個人係唔應該睇嗰啲嘢嘅喎，喺制度上面。

721
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:09,660
係咪？即係你你你點可以一個一個政府？

722
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:14,320
有得呢啲啲噉嘅嘢發生咧，係咪？

723
02:31:14,990 --> 02:31:16,450
即係你係唔得嘅，其實。

724
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:19,900
即係你喺個衡量就係話，法官梗係話喂。

725
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:28,540
誒無端端揾條友入嚟嗰度跟，好似即係誒教教佢做嘢噉樣。佢又佢又未必信得過嗰條友喎，噉佢梗係。

726
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:30,740
即係會排斥㗎啦，即係。

727
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:41,250
即係多香爐多個鬼。如果你舊嘅制度係捱二氣又得，或者即係威威威咁揾就揾個唔適宜去做嗰啲嘢嘅人去做咗佢。

728
02:31:41,890 --> 02:31:45,040
我覺得呢個呢個真係我匪夷所思，有乜理由？

729
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:51,810
即係話揀六個人都揀唔到㗎，真係！即係我真係我唔係好信，即係一你又唔係揀乜嘢，揀啲即係。

730
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:53,690
有至於。

731
02:31:54,130 --> 02:31:58,600
做呢樣嘢嘅優秀嘅律師，即係年青畢畢業咗嘅年青。

732
02:31:59,010 --> 02:32:01,820
或者係即係律師噉，充其量就係噉樣樣。

733
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:05,820
呢個呢個問題解決唔到咧，我覺得係唔合理嘅。

734
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:19,660
第即係你唔唔做嘅，梗係啦。因為我覺得政府係唔可能唔去幫助，因為尤其是阿阿梁振英而家公開鬧我哋打官司啦，有咩咪去法法法庭見啦。噉你唔幫助佢？

735
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:21,650
係咪啊？噉你點搞啊？

736
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:23,560
餓到佢暈。

737
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:31,750
係咪即係唔得嘅根本，即係唔能夠咁唔負責任。我你哋嚟咁多次，我哋都係贊成畀多啲資源你哋。

738
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:44,670
係咪啊？呢個第一，第二咧就講法院嘅問題，即係你有個超級無敵法院喺西九龍，咁而家你講嚟講去都唔夠㗎嘛。我建議就喺呢個西九文化藝術區嗰度整翻等啊！

739
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:46,450
係咁多土地。

740
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:58,400
嗱嗱，即係少嗱，即係你問下香港人，你話喂少啲藝術，多啲法治好唔好？佢梗滯啦，我真係正式建議，反正你都起家無敵，超級無敵。

741
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:18,690
大法院即係大大法大即係大法院，鄰嗰間就喺隔離啫嘛，你咪整整嚿嘢嗰度啦。我唔知阿郭榮亨好唔好啊？你喺而家喺金鐘搭車嗰度都近㗎嘛？你翻過嚟金鐘都誒誒，對唔住，請你哋根據議事規則誒，希望主席啊，兩個議員發言。嗱，我覺得政府做嘢真係要有魄力。

742
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:24,220
我覺得係你，如果我哋個立法人嘅三權分立啊嘛。

743
02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:34,920
立法會覺得司法機關有好多嘢做得唔好，我哋梗係鬧你啦。但係因為資源嘅問題，你唔得，我梗係幫你啦。

744
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:46,590
你真係要敲打下政府先得喎，如果唔係點搞咧？因為佢誒畀地畀錢都係都係佢㗎嘛，噉我不如咁講啊，你贊唔贊成？

745
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:51,610
即係政府大人，即係而家畀阿地利，即係從長計議起好啲法院佢。

746
02:33:51,970 --> 02:33:59,920
因為因為好簡單啫嘛！如果你就算你係請嗰啲誒助理咧，咁都要畀人哋坐嘅，哥畀人哋個有個辦公室㗎。

747
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:06,080
係咪嗰時嗰誒説誒審案日新月異添？我有見到高等法院好落後嘅呢啲設備。

748
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:09,410
即係如果你睇證據睇唔到嘅人喎，好細。

749
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:30,000
我做個鼻哥都睇唔到嘅。正務長，畀啲時間正務長回應啊！好多謝主席。嗯，我諗第一個問題，我想澄清一下咧，嗰個司法助理計劃咧，其實我哋啲文件都講咧，我哋主要都係希望請一啲剛畢業而係好出色嘅畢業生喺佢哋進入佢哋嗰個嘅法律嘅專業嘅時候咧。

750
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:50,010
有一年嘅時間咧，係可以嚟到法院嗰度。一方面，我哋係提供咗個機會畀佢，能夠開闊佢哋嘅眼界，瞭解法庭嘅工作啦。另外一方面，都係對上訴法官咧係提出啲協助。佢哋所做嘅嘢咧，其實完全咧都係主要係做一啲嘅研究嗰方面嘅嘅支援嘅啫。咁而法官咧都係繼續。

751
02:34:50,010 --> 02:35:08,440
做翻自己嘅工作，噉我哋法院每一個法官所做嘅工作都係依對法律去做嘅，咁並唔存在話即係有誒一啲唔唔應該做嘅嘢畀一啲唔應該有人做，即係唔存在呢個問題。唔係，阿主席，我要澄清，我而家指控嗰個人就係佢叫個。

752
02:35:09,090 --> 02:35:29,100
個離案官幫佢睇案件啊嘛，個離案官話我唔得閒，可以幫幫佢睇案件。嗱，呢個可能牽涉到司法人手，同埋咧呢個我哋可能就有機會跟進嘅。但係頭先阿梁演員提都話，另覓一啲地起多啲即係位置畀你哋，因為你哋係唔夠位啊嘛。上次講係係嗰個。

753
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:49,110
個你哋又點樣睇呢個議題？係多謝多謝主席。咁當然我諗，我哋對於整個法院嘅長線，我哋嘅發展噉係中審法院首席法官佢會即係領導我哋一齊去去從長計議啦。咁但係即係譬如西九嗰個法院大樓都係其中嘅一步啦。同埋我頭先講嘅好多好多嘅工作都係逐步逐步。

754
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:55,010
我哋嘅落實啦嚇。好，我諗政務長亦都聽到啊，你意見先畀阿蔣麗雲議員發問。

755
02:35:55,290 --> 02:36:15,300
好唔該啊，主席。我上一次咧，我哋開會咧，就我記得我就問咗一條問題嘅，即係我想知道咧，就係佢新招聘嘅律師當中咧，即係有幾多係專做訴訟案嘅啊？即係嘅律師咁咧，就好似今次啲文件咧，我揾雲好似冇覆到我一樣。

756
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:35,310
嘢噉，我唔好啊！麻煩秘書處幫手跟跟啊，主席係好。嗯，謝務長咁追數喎。唔係佢上一次唔係佢報告時啊。誒，對唔住主席，我唔係好掌握到上一次問嘅一個咩嘢，請議員講清楚少少，係冇嚇。再了上一次，我記得上一次應該唔係係咪佢？

757
02:36:35,310 --> 02:36:55,320
好似唔係佢嘅，我記得政府唔係邊個就係你喺委會係討論過話係佢哋係要跟進咧。我係啦係啦，我就想知道有幾多係係你想要呢個數字訴訟律師嘅，因為佢話佢而家公開招聘㗎嘛，係咪噉啊？當中有幾多訴訟律師咧，或者嗰啲淨係識買賣房產嘅律師咧，定係點樣咧？

758
02:36:55,320 --> 02:37:15,330
即係啲一類嘅司法入去，因為我真係亦都係好希望咧，就幫政府咧，就係嗰個誒，即係幫佢哋誒，即係睇下點嘅問題可以解決咧，即係人手不足啊，或者地方不足啊，資源不足等等嘅問題係咪？即係我哋大家都好珍惜香港嗰個啊，而家嗰個司法係相。

759
02:37:15,330 --> 02:37:21,160
對比較，亦都獨立，亦都非常之誒，即係喺世界上嘅形象都好好㗎。

760
02:37:21,450 --> 02:37:24,740
嗱，阿阿阿主席啊，嗱，我又睇到咧。

761
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:44,720
就睇到咧，就喺誒而家嗰個法官同埋司法人員嘅編制實質人數同埋個空缺啊，一覽表，截至到去我哋今年啊十二月一號咧，咁咧就睇到咧就係啊中審法院嗰個編制咧就即係就係唔缺人嘅。

762
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:55,050
啊，完全到曬位嘅啦。咁咧就上訴法庭嗰個咧，亦都係唔缺嘅，全部到位嘅啦，係咪啊？

763
02:37:55,900 --> 02:38:15,910
嗯，OK。咁但係咧，我咧就亦都係嗯，即係亦都啊，收到有一啲啊啊呢個呢個啊有啲有啲市民咧就有啲意見，因為咧你事實上嚟講咧，即係你話譬如特別係喺誒高達。

764
02:38:15,910 --> 02:38:35,920
等法院嗰個上訴嗰度啊，咁一般嚟講咧，佢哋話誒，即係都等嘅時間幾長啊，嚇噉啊，即係刑事有長，噉啊民事咧就更長啦。咁不過喺呢度我睇到咧，佢話刑事案件由定定日期至聆訊咧，講緊係五十二日。

765
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:39,380
係咪噉啊？即係二以二零一二年嘅實際數。

766
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,570
主席。

767
02:38:41,850 --> 02:39:01,860
係，主席多謝。誒，首先咧就我而家誒，唔好唔好意思，我頭先誒，我我明白啊，蔣議員誒講嗰個問題就係當時佢向行政處提出，咁其實行政處都問咗司法機構咧，攞咗有關嘅資料。我哋將我哋嘅資料畀咗行政處咧，我知道都誒，可能係已經提供咗畀議員。

768
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:21,870
嘅啦，咁但係呢度我都講一講啦，即係當時咧就係問行政署嘅資料，就係話我哋喺誒三月所聘請嘅四十五個嘅司法人員裏邊咧，有幾多個係大律師，有幾多個係事務律師。咁其中咧，我哋喺三月三十一號截止咧，喺四十五。

769
02:39:21,870 --> 02:39:25,390
個即係人員裏邊咧，我哋其實有一。

770
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:35,090
二十七個咧係喺誒外邊聘請翻入嚟嘅。咁喺呢二十七個法官同埋司法人員嘅裏邊咧，總共係有。

771
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:45,730
二十三個係大律師，四個係律師。就算呢啲大律師同埋律師咧，佢哋都係有訴訟經驗嘅人士嚟嘅。咁呢個係一個資料嘅提供。

772
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:56,760
咁第二方面咧，就頭先啊長員問咧，就係話上訴庭嗰個情況，我頭先都簡單提過啦。雖然而家上訴庭咧，嗰個人手咧係全部係。

773
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:17,050
即係足夠啦，十一個位都係填滿。但係我哋做咗個兼誒編制嘅檢視咧，覺得係唔足夠人手嘅，因為而家我哋咧係其實係大量咧都係喺原眾庭嗰度咧要借用即係原眾庭嘅法官咧做額外嘅法官人手，而排期即係嗰個輪候時間仍然都係未達理想。

774
02:40:17,050 --> 02:40:27,370
咁所以我就頭先喺我哋嘅人手嘅編制檢視裏邊咧，我哋覺得係要增添人手嘅。噉我哋呢個建議都係已經係去作出咗，畀嗯。

775
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:47,690
噉我喺呢一度講多一句咧，就係我亦喺我哋呢一個好緊缺嘅人手同埋嗰個輪候時間壓力底下咧，我哋其實法官嘅指示咧就話我哋要將優先次序咧擺喺刑事嘅上訴。咁一個其中個重要嘅考慮就好多刑事上訴嘅人士佢可能係已經。

776
02:40:47,690 --> 02:41:07,700
係大部分係監禁當中啦，咁所以咧係我哋應該要盡量咧係要將優先次序嘅處理。咁所以你睇到我哋畀翻大家嗰個輪候時間咧，嗰個刑事嘅上訴咧係十分之維持接近喺目標嘅左右嘅。咁呢個就係我頭先解釋呢一個我哋誒嗰個優先次序處。

777
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:20,510
處理係盡量將嗰個輪候時間嗰個誒影響減到最低。好誒，或者咧就講畀總議員聽咧，就應該十二月十號秘書處有份文件C.B.括弧四二二三。

778
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:31,190
誒十三-hyphen十四咧，裏邊就係有誒政務長提到嘅補充資料嘅，咁嗰度可以你都可以睇下，係張議員。

779
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:51,680
嚇！我我我都係誒，想了解一下咧，就係誒，可唔可以下一次咧，再畀誒多少少資料，即係提供畀我哋咧？我都好想知道咧，喺過去，譬如話係誒講過去十年啦，咁咧就有幾多案件咧？

780
02:41:51,680 --> 02:42:00,500
咧就係啊，喺高等法院嗰度等上訴或者排期上訴咁嚇，咁咧就啊。

781
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:20,800
誒有啲人即係誒即係出獄前嚇三個月，咁仲未輪到佢上訴嘅咧，有幾多呢啲噉嘅case咧？即係噉，因為咧我哋即係都睇到啦。噉你好多案件有啲人直頭出咗嚟啦，坐完監啦，出嚟之後咧先至即係。

782
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:40,810
上訴到先至輪到上訴，咁而佢上訴係贏咗㗎，係我諗。假如係大家都記得，即係好好幾單嘢啦。咁咧呢一啲係咪即係覺得係好似真係對當事人嚟講係即係唔係咁咩咧？咁嚇即係我哋就從呢度亦都係睇到係咪真係我哋嗰個。

783
02:42:40,810 --> 02:43:00,820
啊！高等法院嘅法官係真係咁缺咧，時間真係咁緊張咧，噉係嘛？係。張議員嘅意見，我諗政務長聽到，我哋先畀其他委員咧，再誒問埋先嚇。劉慧卿議員誒，多謝主席。誒，主席啊，我哋喺呢個月三號咧，咪去司法機構去即係。

784
02:43:00,820 --> 02:43:20,830
誒佢哋邀請我哋去，大家去探訪。咁當時我哋都到同首席法官提出呢個問題啦。噉就誒，我相信係呢個問題係嚴重嘅。就算當時講話，就算有啲位咧，如果係可以誒請到人咧，其實都冇地方坐嘅，淨係。

785
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:33,110
唔係話淨係有個法庭，或者有個寫字樓畀個法官，而係佢其他好多人㗎嘛。咁所以呢個係需要當即係當局去規劃，但係亦都要司法機構提出。

786
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:45,590
噉我相信，我希望係提出咗添啦。你知道而家做事嗰啲嘢，主席，就算而家今日提出或者琴日提出啊，十年後、十五年後有都都係奇蹟啊！

787
02:43:45,870 --> 02:44:05,880
咁所以，我唔知道即係或者啊啊，司法機構政務長可以講講係咪其實你哋已經提出咗㗎啦，抑或點咧？同埋前上個禮拜開嗰個公務小組委員會咧，我當時都同當局講啦嚇，我話喂，我話司法機構係好需要地方㗎喎，我話你政府要去同。

788
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:25,890
同佢配合先得。噉佢哋就即係佢聽咗啦。咁但係我相信，即係政府當然要知悉呢個問題。但係或者啊，政務長可以講講畀我哋聽，其實你哋已經講咗幾多嘢畀行政機關聽，係點樣着手去揾地啊？去去設計嗰啲嘢咧。唔該，政務長。

789
02:44:25,890 --> 02:44:45,900
多謝主席，多謝劉慧卿嘅議員。誒，有關我哋即係法院，即係嗰個短期長線嗰個嘅需要同埋規劃咧，整體嚟講都喺中審法院首席法官嘅領導之下咧，係進行當中嘅。咁當然，我頭先講到有啲係好即時我哋需要嘅嘢，噉我哋已經係提出咗，亦都係以。

790
02:44:45,900 --> 02:45:05,910
經係進行緊磋商啦。至於長遠嘅工作，亦都係需要長從長計議嘅。咁但係即係我哋好多謝議員對司法機構嗰個資源嘅需要嘅即係支持啦。噉我哋嗰方邊咧喺首席法官嘅領導底下咧，我哋係不時同埋而家都仍在仍然係繼續咧係檢視同埋。

791
02:45:05,910 --> 02:45:11,890
喺度係去啊，有即係按我哋嘅需要，係唔同階段咁一路去提出嘅。

792
02:45:12,530 --> 02:45:31,490
多謝主席。咁咁即係即係點咧嚇？我我唔係好清楚，你真係咩意思咧？你哋自己承唔承認？而家係人手唔夠嚇，亦都唔夠地方擺。咁一來可能你請唔到人啦。你文件嗰度話嗰啲高等法院法官超並餘一輪，淨係請得一個。

793
02:45:31,930 --> 02:45:51,940
係咪唔夠？因為你睇翻嗰啲等候嘅時間，亦都係好長，尤其是喺呢個嚴重法院法庭。噉你哋明唔明有呢個問題？然後着手一齊去解決啊嘛。我聽完阿政務長講，我我真係唔知你你係想講乜嘢？政務長，誒主席，我哋喺嗰個文件同埋我頭先嘅簡介都提出咗。

794
02:45:51,940 --> 02:46:11,950
喺嗰個人手嘅編制，我哋檢視咗係覺得係需要增撥資源嘅，即係我哋已經將呢個檢視嘅結果咧，即係係已經向政府當局提出咗嚇。咁所以即係我哋誒呢一方面，我哋即係已經係有咗一個嘅睇法，亦都將我哋嘅資源嘅即係建議咧係去提出咗嚇。

795
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:21,310
係，喺嗰個地方嗰方面。係啦，你你而家就算畀咗錢，你去請人啊？首席法官都話冇地方坐，噉樣坐坐喺地下。

796
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:22,370
啊！

797
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:43,330
主席，誒，我相信首席法官講嘅時候就係話，我哋現時需要請嘅人咧，我哋係有足夠嘅地方。我頭先都解釋咗咧，係畀佢哋辦公同埋個人手嘅。我相信首席法官所講嘅就話，如果將來我哋有更大嘅人手需要，即係將來我哋有更大嘅人手需要喺嗰個開會嘅時候，如果我哋要再加多好多。

798
02:46:43,330 --> 02:47:03,340
多個空位誒空缺，或者我哋要再有好多好多嘅嘢嘅時候咧，噉我哋要同時要考慮就係嗰個嘅即係地方嘅需要。我諗議員關心嘅咧都係即係而家現時睇唔到你哋嗰個誒人手係足以應付社會嘅需要，所以你符合咗之後咧都係其實關心嘅就係你將。

799
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:16,830
將來你嘅規劃，你成個計劃係點樣可以係誒滿足到市民希望縮短輪候時間？嗱，我哋仲有誒誒謝偉俊議員等誒，畀謝偉俊議員誒發問先嚇。

800
02:47:20,060 --> 02:47:21,350
文件咧就。

801
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:29,540
誒先講個法庭等候時間咧，似乎就係誒其他大部分法庭咧都似乎係誒問題不大嘅。

802
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:49,830
問題不大，意思就話唔係話佢哋一定係準時，又起碼咧即係差嘅時間唔係太多。但係其中一個好特別見到嘅就係嗰個land tribunal，佢哋審裁處咧就長期都係即係over achieve嘅insert，即係個意思就係話佢哋個等嘅時間好短、好短、好短嘅。咁呢個係咪咩原因咧？係咪因為我哋啲案少咗？如果係嘅話，係咪應該將有部分嘅資源擺喺其他法地方？

803
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:54,000
法院個水平度，等佢唔使即係嘥咗咧。呢個enclosure two見到㗎。

804
02:47:54,280 --> 02:48:14,290
至於第二樣嘢咧，睇翻誒有關於Enclosure One嗰度咧，有關於嗰個誒空字率嘅問題。誒喺嗰個元訴法庭咧，就似乎而家有七個啦嚇嗰個空字，但係睇翻個地方法院就minus八個嘅，即係負八嘅意思係咪即係話而家係超突咗人嘅咧？咁剛。

805
02:48:14,290 --> 02:48:34,300
剛才咧就秘書長解釋過咧，就話因為誒誒地方法院以上嘅法官咧，佢哋考慮到有個所謂permanent tenure嘅問題，即係唔可以翻轉頭，唔係一個旋轉門嘅問題，所以就可能考慮依方面係會困難啲，有啲誒私人執業嘅律師咧未必想噉樣做。咁但係照算地方法院同埋最高法院係咪都應該有類似預見嘅問題？定還是有分別一？

806
02:48:34,300 --> 02:48:44,080
到咧，零至到地方法院係好似冇乜問題，招吸招聘人手，但係最高法院就似乎就出咗問題咧，咁或者長期出咗問題咧。第三咧就係誒。

807
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:46,170
睇翻嗰個誒。

808
02:48:46,450 --> 02:48:47,540
誒。

809
02:48:48,510 --> 02:49:08,520
第十六至十八段嘅文件裏邊，有關於啲臨時嘅替工嚇，即係呢啲deputy judges。咁呢個咧就係似乎睇翻個數字咧，係過往嗰三十五個月咧，第十七段、第十八段咧，就喺誒曾經試過所謂做呢啲臨時嘅工作嘅誒法官裏邊咧，就差唔多就要五十七個。

810
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:28,610
超差唔多近一半咧，係即係唔再做嘅。咁當局咧，你哋招聘呢啲人手嘅時候咧，你哋其實有冇一個比較誒慎重嘅考慮，就係話究竟呢個做法係純粹臨時拉夫頂住檔先咧，定還是諗住事實上咧係需要有一個過程畀大家可以互相拍拖了解下，然後係適合嘅就可以再請佢做即係正式結婚咧咁？

811
02:49:28,610 --> 02:49:48,620
噉係邊個情況咧？咁如果唔係噉樣嘅話咧，係咪應該考慮下喺嗰個誒？你哋嗰一段提過關於嗰個所謂誒judicial assistance嗰度，即係有啲即係輔助嗰度。咁而家似乎呢個係另一個途徑，可以揾到一啲嘅法官係可能未必係真係執業嘅律師，但係由於佢睇得多咧，即係都睇得法官做得多咧，可能佢哋嘅興趣可能大。

812
02:49:48,620 --> 02:50:08,630
啲咧，將來經過入幹嘅時間之後咧，佢哋會可能啊，去快手去嗰個bench度幫手嘅。咁呢個會唔會係一個考慮？會考慮多啲去promote嘅，多啲去推廣嘅一個途徑。好似外國啲地方咧，佢哋今日事實有啲法官學校添啦。咁呢個係可能亦都彌補咗一啲嘅執業者未必想或者優優質嘅業者未必想做法官嗰個問題。

813
02:50:08,630 --> 02:50:10,860
呢個起期望回答唔該，係政務長。

814
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:31,610
多謝主席。首先，或者我想講一講就於有關於無論我哋長遠嘅人手同埋資源規劃咧，我哋一路係做緊嘅。噉我諗詳細嘅情況喺適當嘅時候咧，我哋一定會向議員彙報。但係好多工作係進行當中。第二樣嘢咧就有關自啊啊謝偉俊議員咧啊提到嘅幾方面啊。

815
02:50:31,610 --> 02:50:51,620
土地審裁處嗰個輪候時間咧，其實喺過去幾年裏邊咧，我哋都係誒嗰個案件量係比較係唔係特別高啦，佢係係比較短嘅。咁其實我哋做咗一個工作咧，就係話喺過去一年嘅裏邊，我哋對於所有目標輪候時間咧都做咗一個整體嘅檢討，亦。

816
02:50:51,620 --> 02:51:11,630
即係就呢個檢討咧，徵詢咗我哋法庭使用者委員會嘅意見。噉我係打算喺二月左右咧，會有一個文件咧，就都會向翻即係事務委員會匯報翻我哋嘅檢討結果。咁不過我講嗰個目標輪候時間，因為有陣時個輪候時間同案件同埋好多好多嘅因素都有關啦。咁所以究竟我哋個

817
02:51:11,630 --> 02:51:31,640
目標嘅時間要定喺邊一度咧，都考慮一男子嘅因素嘅。咁或者喺土地嗰個輪候時間，我哋可以喺嗰個嘅情況之下咧，再詳細嘅去去介紹。第二方面咧就有關嗰個區域法院嗰個嘅情況。嗱嗰個問題咧主要就係噉嘅。誒，我解釋一下啦。

818
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:51,650
因為喺區域法院嘅法官咧，佢哋嘅等級咧，同高等法院離案官嘅等級咧係一致嘅。咁所以我哋誒司法機構咧，而家嗰個政策咧就係為咗方便人手嘅調配咧，我哋就唔會額外淨係請高等法院離案官嘅職位。噉我哋咧就會請區域法院嘅法官嘅職。

819
02:51:51,650 --> 02:52:11,660
位，然之後區域法院嘅法官咧係可以調配去出任高等法院臨案官，咁所以你睇到嗰度個空缺即係古巴咧，就即係其實嗰個人手我哋係將高等法院臨案官加埋區域法院法官夾埋一齊去請，所以有一個嗯，即係誒雖然喺上。

820
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:15,700
邊嗰個嘅撇個空缺咧，係誒少啲。

821
02:52:15,980 --> 02:52:35,990
即係多啲誒，有九，佢有九個空缺，但係因為其實區域法院嗰度咧，我哋係誒以一個抵消嘅方式係有八個法官，咁所以其實兩個夾埋個空缺得一個嘅啫。而家所以嗰個係一個互相調配人手嗰個係技術上嘅數數字嘅問題，即係我我唔知解釋得清唔清。講喺。

822
02:52:35,990 --> 02:52:56,000
嗱噉樣喺政務長誒誒啱啱講完，回應咗阿謝偉俊議員咧，就我想同大家講講時間問題。我希望大家咧都即係我就想咧就誒延長呢個會議十五分鐘誒，因為咧有兩位嘅議員咧都想係第二輪誒發問，咁咧我自己咧亦都係誒想補。

823
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:05,360
補充嘅嗰個追問嘅，咁首先咧，我就想問即係幾樣嘢。第一呢一次，我想同植務長講咧，我哋係第二次再討論呢個問題㗎啦，即係呢一屆。

824
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:22,330
第二咧就係我哋都提過嘅，我哋每一屆好似都有啲誒目標噉嘅。上一屆講好多法律援助嘅，咁呢一屆咧其實人手、司法人手同埋長嘅輪候時間咧，係似乎我哋係成個委員會係好多嘅議員都係好關心。

825
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:42,790
咁咧就誒頭先政務長即係提到啦，我睇聽到咧你就係話咧誒而家咧希望咧好清楚啦，講話喺原仲庭誒喺上訴庭，你哋希望增撥資源，但係我又記得上次你提到咧原仲庭嗰個缺乏人手嗰個情況係最嚴重嘅嚇，噉係究竟係淨係上訴庭定係原仲庭嗱？噉我問一。

826
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:51,000
係列嘅問題咧，你可以一次過喺喺第二輪大家嘅同事問嘅。第一，究竟而家咧係點樣物色？

827
02:53:51,640 --> 02:54:11,650
第二嗰個制度究竟係點樣嗱？因為咧，我哋所瞭解法律界嘅，尤其是執業嘅律師，佢加入司法嘅行列咧，真係未必真係再係為咗錢㗎。佢係嗰個滿足感啊，嗰個志向啊，各方面。咁而家咧人手不足嘅時候咧，會唔會令到佢亦都有時咧有沮喪啦？因為

828
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:31,660
時間唔足夠，令到佢係充分嘅考慮一個案件咧。第三咧，係咪聚焦培訓一啲法官？你哋吸納咗嘅咁呢個就包括埋咧。阿阿蔣麗雲議員嘅問題，其實除咗大律師、律師嘅分別，其實大律師裏邊都有分邊一範噉啊，商業啊、刑事啊、民事啊，律師亦都有分範數。

829
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:36,410
嘅就唔係話淨係房地產係律師，亦都有有係訴訟嘅律師㗎。

830
02:54:36,690 --> 02:54:39,390
咁咧，跟住咧就係嗰個嘅。

831
02:54:39,690 --> 02:54:40,950
即係司法。

832
02:54:41,630 --> 02:55:01,640
助手嗰個問題咧，大家似乎都係幾多嘅議員都話係希望咧，你哋係可以喺呢個制度裏邊咧係誒誒常規化，或者你哋即係唔好話淨係試咗得幾個噉樣，而係真係諗下點樣令到咧我哋嘅法官係有多少少時間，令到嗰個判決佢嗰個精力。

833
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:21,650
同埋質素係可以改善嘅咁咧就誒，所以咧頭先提到嘅一個好重要嘅，即係我聽到誒政務長講咧，就係你哋而家咧認為側重點咧喺刑事嘅案件多啲，但係咧正正我經歷過嘅一啲協助嘅個案咧，都係喺民事案件嘅，無論喺誒誹謗。

834
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:41,660
啦，或者係勞工啦，咁咧你延長咗去之後咧，其實都救唔翻咯。嗰個案件咧，十年之後、五年之後，先至最後咧，佢上訴咗去到中審法院，先有個有個判決出嚟。嗱，呢啲呢啲嘅情況咧，喺民事上都唔係話咧，雖然刑事當然啦，你直情係去去剝奪。

835
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:59,220
咗自由啊嘛！但係民事你係即係我哋都成日講啦，係嘛？Justice delayed, justice denied。咁呢一個就民事你都係要係誒增加人手嘅。咁所以我希望咧就政務長喺呢一度咧誒可以回應一下嗰個問題。

836
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:19,510
多謝主席。首先一個問題咧，就係嗱，我哋檢視咗啦，即係發覺其實上訴法庭需要增撥人手啦。咁其實嗰個情況就係而家原仲庭嗰個輪候時間好長，其中個原因咧，就好多原仲庭嘅法官咧，其實用咗好大部分嘅時間咧，係要去上訴庭嗰度咧，係以額外人手去幫手。

837
02:56:19,510 --> 02:56:39,520
嗯，咁所以如果當我哋喺上訴庭嗰個資源嘅實任嘅資源咧，能夠增加咗咧，噉就可以多咗原眾庭嘅法官嘅人手去做翻原眾庭嘅工作。咁喺呢一方面咧，係會有幫助。咁亦都適時，我哋會檢視喺其他方邊可能係喺誒。

838
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:55,580
要提供更多嘅時間資源畀法官，無論係去預備案件啊、培訓啊，咁都需要有增撥資源嘅。咁呢啲都喺我哋個人手編制嘅檢視裏邊咧，一拼咧喺即係首席法官嘅領導之下咧，同埋指示之下咧，係處理緊。

839
02:56:55,860 --> 02:57:15,870
咁呢個就係第一個問題，所以就我哋即係覺得嗰個問題就係話點解處理咗上訴庭法官嘅人手咧，會對原眾庭法官嘅人手咧，即係都會有一個幫助呢個第一點。第二點咧就係你講到嗰個司法嘅誒時間去工作嘅問題啦。其實係偏案比每一個法。

840
02:57:15,870 --> 02:57:35,880
法官去審理要有幾多時間去預備佢做審前嘅預備，或者審後寫判詞嘅預備咧？基本上呢個工作嘅指導咧，係由每一級法院嘅法院領導去做嘅。咁現時咧，我哋嘅排期嘅同事咧，佢哋點樣去編排啲案件，或者要點樣留空呢啲時間畀法官去做？

841
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:55,890
預備同埋審案之後嘅工作咧，嗰個指引完全係跟即係首席法官嘅指示。咁喺個別嘅情況，如果有啲法官因為案件特別嘅去誒，即係複雜，佢需要更多嘅時間去處理一啲即係誒寫判詞嘅工作啊，或者係誒要閲讀文件嘅嘅時間咧。而家係有。

842
02:57:55,890 --> 02:58:15,900
有一個機制咧，就係透過法官同首席法官嗰個嘅誒磋商嘅時候咧，係可以額外去畀佢有時間嘅。咁所以而家嗰個做法係噉樣樣。咁最尾咧就係誒啊，主席你提到嗰個嘅誒民事嗰方面啦。我頭先解釋咧就係話我哋。

843
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:35,910
而家同意咧，即係嗰個高等法院嘅輪候時間係長係唔理想嘅，所以長遠嚟講，我哋係要增加人手去請多啲實任嘅法官，然之後去解決呢個問題。但係喺短期嘅時候咧，唔係話一招一直可以解決到嘅時候咧。我頭先解釋就話，我哋會將啲優先次序擺喺處理一啲比較。

844
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:55,920
較逐即係我哋認為係需要有優先處理嘅案件。咁喺民事方邊咧，我哋都有呢一方面嘅考慮嘅。嗱，根據誒首席誒誒根據誒高等法院首席法官佢嗰個指示啦，就喺民事方邊咧誒一般嚟講咧，優先次序我哋會畀幾類嘅案件嘅。

845
02:58:55,920 --> 02:59:15,930
一方面係某一啲嘅誒司法複核嘅案件，因為佢嗰個性質咧係需要即時嘅處理嘅。咁現時司法誒複核嘅案件咧已經有專責嘅法官去處理啦。咁如果個專責法官覺得有一啲嘅案件佢係需要係要提早或者要盡快處理咧，而家係儘量。

846
02:59:15,930 --> 02:59:35,940
會畀一個更早嘅時間去處理佢嘅，咁所以我哋睇司法覆核嗰個嘅輪候時間咧，係遠低過我哋嘅目標時間。另外一啲嘅案件就係可能都好明顯啦，即係好似係禁制令嘅案件啦，咁呢啲都係需要好有時間嗰方面嘅考慮。咁而家我哋暫時嗰個處理就係話都會。

847
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:44,790
會係啊，根據法官嘅指示咧，對於一啲需要優先處理嘅案件咧，係儘量優先處理，以至要將嗰個影響係減低嘅。

848
02:59:45,320 --> 03:00:01,220
多謝主席。先處理，始終都係唔理想，即係都可，即係希望盡量每個案件咧，個縮縮短輪候時間。嗱，而家咧第二輪排緊隊嘅咧，誒本來應該係田北辰議員先嘅，佢行咗出去，噉我哋咧就係畀阿郭榮亨議員。

849
03:00:01,590 --> 03:00:21,600
三分鐘，我諗咧嗰個重點咧就係大家都知道誒，你一定要繼續請法官㗎啦。OK，噉你嗰個誒法院咧本身又有限嘅，噉你唔係話請到到時候你發覺啊唔夠法院啦，漸去諗幾時去邊度揾錢，同埋去邊度起咁到時。

850
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:41,610
有五至十年嘅啦，即係我諗頭先，劉慧卿議員講嗰個點就係話：喂，你你都而家開始諗定，因為譬如好似新加坡噉樣啦，最近佢哋已經係宣佈成立一個國際商業法庭（International Commercial Court）。嗱，呢個人哋又又諗，即係人哋已經係諗定啊，點樣發展第。

851
03:00:41,610 --> 03:01:01,620
嗰個誒將佢嗰個司法資源啊提高咁嗱，我我開心聽到咧就係誒，即係官員就講話今次佢係會向政府攞多啲資源嚇呢個第行出咗第一步，即係佢成日過去資源係攞唔夠，而家要攞多啲資源請多啲人咁誒嗱。請人嗰方面咧，我希望你再考。

852
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:11,610
考慮下咧，就係誒當日首席法官都有咁講嘅，就係如果佢係落見咧，如果有更多嘅誒誒問誒一啲誒。

853
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:31,900
事務律師咧，即係做開訴訟嘅事務律師咧，係願意投身呢個司法機關咧，佢係非常之歡迎嘅。咁喺依一方面，即係係去揾多啲事務律師去做法官咧，依一方面，你會有啲咩嘅準備咧？係有啲咩物色？有咩準備工作啊，政務長？係多謝阿郭議員嘅問題。

854
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:51,910
誒，我哋都即係討論過呢個問題，就即係而家喺法院裏邊咧，我哋都係有誒唔同程度咧，係比較多係大律師參加，但係亦都有誒唔少嘅事務律師咧，係有訴訟經驗嘅，即係事務律師咧，係加入法官同埋司法人員嘅行列嘅。咁嗰個重點咧，即係我相信首席法官都。

855
03:01:51,910 --> 03:02:11,920
從都同議員即係誒誒，我哋亦都多次喺唔同嘅會議都同誒議員去交代咧。就如果要作為一個加入法官嗰個行列咧，佢有訴訟經驗係一個幾重要嘅先決條件。咁過往咧，就是牧師喺高等法院咧係咪有出言嘅發言權啦？咁現時已經有。

856
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:31,930
咗一個機制，咁有事務師咧，就係能夠喺啊獲取咗高等法院嘅出言誒出庭發言權啦。咁所以，我哋希望有即係透過呢啲嘅發展，有更多嘅事務律師，佢哋有更多嘅訴訟經驗，而增加即係嗰個即係嗰個啊嗰個人手嗰個嘅啊可。

857
03:02:31,930 --> 03:02:51,940
可可可可能即係有有機會嘅人手嗰個數目咧，即係啊potential，即係嗰個嗰個數目咧，會更加更加嘅廣泛。咁但係我相信即係呢一方面嚟講咧，就係誒呢一方面，我哋係喺從司法機構嘅角度咧，無論係事務律師同埋事務律師，總之佢符合。

858
03:02:51,940 --> 03:03:11,950
資格佢亦都有訴訟經驗嘅咧，我哋都係係一樣噉樣係歡迎噉。因為喺嗰個招聘裏邊，主要嚟講咧，都睇翻佢個專業嘅才能同埋司法嘅誒質素嘅。係，多謝主席。誒時間咧已經到啦，即係我淨係希望咧，謝務長可以誒聽到啦。我都今即係今日我哋用。

859
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:14,090
用咗家事嘅時間咧。

860
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:34,770
就係誒排期審訊真係好磋磨，嗰種磋磨係好痛苦嘅。其實對於雙方當事人，無論邊一類嘅案件，所以咧就即係頭先你講咗有啲案件，你哋會係側重排期快啲，亦都正正顯示咗咧有其他類別嘅案件就係唔夠人。

861
03:03:34,770 --> 03:03:54,780
手就係會係拖慢咗排期嘅時間，所以咧基本上我哋委員會咧，我哋第二次傾十二月三號同阿誒馬道立大法官，亦都係好重視呢個問題。噉我相信咧，希望咧嗱，今日我可以翻去再畀時間你哋，就係我話點樣物色，我係始終相信而家。

862
03:03:54,780 --> 03:04:14,790
執業律師係咁多嚇，主要你主要有一個目標去物識目標去栽培唔同嘅專長嘅法官喺唔同嘅誒階梯嘅法院咧，我相信只要你哋係積極去做咧，係應該可以有一個比較具。

863
03:04:14,790 --> 03:04:34,800
具體嘅嘅計劃咧，畀我哋睇到，起碼五年十年啊！劉希志全話：噉你都畀到一個曙光畀香港人，即係我哋係的確咧，樣樣都好，就係排期長呢樣嘢咧，係唔夠競爭力嘅。呢個你應該係要接受呢個係呢個事實，亦都公眾係好多嘅問題喺呢一。

864
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:54,810
度係覺得話好痛苦㗎，排期咁長噉，所以咧，我希望頭先我哋特別提到你點樣物識咧，你嘅制度係點咧？點樣去鼓勵更多人參加？可能呢啲係要積極去諗下，唔係淨係用以往嘅方式。噉我哋一定會仲有機會咧，就係繼續會討論呢個議題嘅。噉我希望咧，阿政務長翻去咧。

865
03:04:54,810 --> 03:05:14,820
亦都再具體啲話畀我哋聽，因為我哋上次就個個得出一個一個印象，就係又唔夠地方嘅，唔夠地方起地方。你話幾長嘅時間咧？咁呢啲咧，其實你哋司法機構咧應該開心咧，就係好少立法會嘅委員會成日都問你夠唔夠錢用，成日你有啲咩需要。其實呢個咧係一。

866
03:05:14,820 --> 03:05:34,830
定係同公眾嘅利益同埋需求根本係掛鈎嘅，好冇啊？噉我哋咧就係好，劉永興議員應該咧就係誒，譬如話年中啊噉樣就再傾呢樣嘢，就唔係淨係話揾啊司法機構嚟傾，即係叫埋應該係行政處長啦，係咪啊？負責你哋嗰啲咁多，又。

867
03:05:34,830 --> 03:05:46,850
我都唔知邊係咪行政處長，因為邊個政府嘅行政機關嘅部門噉，到時佢哋應該傾過啦。噉啊，睇下有啲咩嘅建議，係係咪行政處長咧，或者係金務長？係金務長。

868
03:05:47,730 --> 03:05:57,850
誒更加協助到我哋。我我諗呢個我唔能夠代表政府答啦，因為可能佢唔同嘅議題，佢會有唔同嘅人嚇。噉我地方係邊個啊？

869
03:05:59,060 --> 03:06:19,070
即係你哋需要再討論嘅。如果你哋係頭先講，譬如將來嘅規劃五年、十年，加咗幾多個法官，係咪要真係要需要更多地方或者其他？除咗你哋，誒，我我相信呢個問題咧，主席即係希望你畀翻政府啦，即係畀翻政府決定，因為唔係我哋司法機構話。唔緊要啦，主席，我哋同佢講。

870
03:06:19,070 --> 03:06:39,080
好，我哋嗱收到議員嘅意見，噉我哋咧都會繼續跟進。我哋睇下今誒今即係二零一四年嗰個排期，應該會有機會咧係再討論咧，就希望到時係有具體啲嘅頭先我哋聚焦嘅一啲問題，特別係點樣增加法官嗰個人數啊，各方面好冇啊？係係誒，主席，我我想喺呢度。

871
03:06:39,790 --> 03:06:59,800
阿主啊，就我哋唔係講佢呢度，呢度講完啦嚇。噉我其實而家我哋係咪可以講講其他事項？已經完㗎啦，係啦，呢個啦，呢個項目你係有啲乜嘢即係我想講講咧，就係誒討論事項㗎，阿主席。係咁咧，就誒，我哋好唔好誒睇下可唔可以排期咧？因為其實咧，而

872
03:06:59,800 --> 03:07:07,540
而家即係誒誒，即係已經誒，大家都知道啦。香港咧，有時咧，真係打個官司係非常之貴嘅。

873
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:10,300
咁咧就亦都有好多市民咧，即係。

874
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:30,730
尤其是一啲中產添嚇，你一係咧就係索性係冇錢嘅冇資產嘅，噉你可能咧就可以即係仲申請到綜援，但係有一啲咧就中產嘅話，根本咧就係綜援又唔到，即係嗰個叫法援又唔到佢嚇，法援又唔到佢，咁咧就去打場官司。

875
03:07:30,730 --> 03:07:50,740
師咧就真係都幾大鑊㗎，咁咧就最近咧就都有一啲啊，即係好淒涼啊嚇！打官司輸咗，仲要畀埋對方嘅堂費，咁咧嘅情況都有出現。咁咧，但係而家嘅中間最主要嘅問題咧，好多時發現咧就係有時要請律師咧，即係佢本本身你又你你又要請個律師律。

876
03:07:50,740 --> 03:08:10,750
律師又要請個啊叫叫做大律師，大律師又要帶個Junior，Junior叫Junior資深，跟住資深資深係啦，即係你咁成串人噉，個個都要畀錢，個個都同你計小時喎，係咪？咁所以呢一樣嘢，我哋係咪需要可以討論一下，需唔需要重要咁重複咁？係咪有噉嘅必要咁多嘅人一？

877
03:08:10,750 --> 03:08:30,760
睇咧係咪咁多律師咧咁？嗯，阿蔣議員提嘅係咪即係嗰個誒事務律師，即係solicitor同埋嗰個大律師，佢哋即係而家我哋就即係誒要有事務律師同埋大律師，大律師去誒係咪一個律師可以處理一個案件嘅問題？一個律師可以做曬係啦係啦。好，我哋研究一下好冇啊？

878
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:50,770
我哋睇下今年嗰個誒誒會期嗰個時間誒呢個問題咧喺誒喺誒專業界喺法律界都有曾經有啲嘅討論嘅，好冇？噉我聽到啊蔣議員嘅意見，亦都多謝啊政務長同埋啊啊司法機構幾位嘅代表。咁今日嘅會。

879
03:08:50,770 --> 03:08:54,320
議咧係正式宣佈結束嘅，多謝大家。好多謝。
