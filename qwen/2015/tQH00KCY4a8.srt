1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,500
我哋問佢就。

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,500
係。

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:18,030
另一個方法就係讀團體名，讀團體名，啊，團體團體易讀啲，因為性有難讀嘅。但係佢講英文嗰度嘅，誒係啊，但係我哋有翻譯㗎嘛，係咯，即係你話可以，但係當然你話誒，即係即係團體名就易讀咧。

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,890
誒啲姓就唔係英文嚟。

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,870
就係呢個。

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,190
okay。

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,910
讀讀團體啦，團體二跌，團體名二跌，除咗呢兩個，呢兩個話未止，呢啲都係過。

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,690
我哋夠人開會啦！而家請緊啲團喺度，埋官官員入咗嚟，等啲團喺入埋嚟先。

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:09,970
咁今日個議題主要就係講嗰個失業續續業同就業有關嘅一啲工作同埋政策。噉我哋先先咧會等誒官方講咗啲而家嘅政策。不過我哋希望官方講嘅事嘅儘量係重點式介紹。

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,110
即係我哋份文件，佢嗰啲團體有冇㗎？呢份文件。

11
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,820
誒，佢上網有收。上網有啊。

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,960
咁誒重點式介紹，我希望聽多啲佢哋講嘅嘢，係嘛？噉佢哋講完之後，都官方都係再答。

13
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,820
係，我哋歡迎一啲關注少族族裔、一些少族族裔嘅團體今日出席我哋嘅會議。

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,760
係講大家嘅睇法啊！

15
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,540
嗯。

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,400
ok.

17
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:18,100
佢哋幾分鐘啊？三分鐘，三分鐘。O K，好誒，我哋歡迎誒政府同埋誒咁多廿八個團體嘅代表咧，係出席我哋今次嘅會議。噉我希望透過今次嘅會議咧，係既可以聽到政府就住少族族裔就業嘅問題同埋政策嘅介紹。咁當然我哋希望咧都聽到係。

18
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,170
誒出席嘅廿八個團體代表，佢哋講佢自己或者團體嗰啲嘅睇法。

19
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:43,460
咁咧，想大家留意咧，就係今日嘅講話咧，誒發言咧係冇呢一個立法會嘅權利嘅特權法案，即係可以保護嘅，即係冇嚇，即係冇呢個保護，所以大家誒發言嘅時候希望大家留意。第一咧，第二咧就係誒，大家前面嗰個制咧係零號咧，就係延長版一號咧。

20
00:02:43,460 --> 00:03:03,470
就廣東話二號就英文三號咧就係普通話噉。大家按自己嗰個誒誒去決定，即係按幾多號啊嘛。咁咧就我哋會陣間就係分開兩個部三個部分咧。第一部分咧就我哋請官方嘅管政府部門咧係講述而家嘅政策，咁大概五分鐘到。咁跟住就讓每一個團體咧。

21
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:18,810
大概有三分鐘嘅時間，係講你哋嘅睇法，然後跟住就政府回應啦。政府回應完之後咧，就到我哋議員呢一邊嘅提問啦。噉樣好嘛？咁好唔好？而家先先請誒政府嘅同事講講你而家嘅政策，大概五分鐘到係。

22
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:39,100
邊位？誒，多謝主席。或者我首先咧講講我哋個就業方面嗰個嗰個做法啦嚇。咁咧，我哋誒，我係勞工處嘅。噉我哋係好關注咧少數族裔人士嘅就業需要嘅。咁同埋我哋係好致力為佢哋提供好全面同埋多元化嘅就業服務。咁希望咧幫到佢哋咧係揾到工作同埋。

23
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
融入社會嘅。

24
00:03:40,990 --> 00:04:01,000
咁誒，同其他嘅求職人士一樣啦，小學族裔人士咧係可以利用我哋好多嘅誒免費嘅就業服務同埋設施嘅。咁喺呢度我唔詳細講，因為我哋文件都有。咁但係因為因應咧誒佢哋嘅需要啦，我哋係特別咧有一啲服務咧係畀佢哋嘅，包括咧我哋嘅中心咧都設有資訊角啦。

25
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:21,310
係提供各類型嘅就業資訊啦，亦都設置特別櫃枱，係專責幫佢哋咧係提供工作轉介嘅服務。我哋定期咧為佢哋咧安排依個就業講座，係希望能到令到佢哋咧係認識依個就業市場嘅最新情況，同埋改善依個求職嘅技巧嘅。我哋更

26
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:41,320
加為佢哋提供一啲個人化嘅就業諮詢服務，噉佢哋可以咧係同我哋嘅就業中心嘅顧問咧係面談，噉係傾下了解下嗰個市場嘅情況啦，同埋徵詢求職嘅意見啦，同埋索取咧好多培訓嘅資料啊，或者係瞭解社區嘅資源。咁喺零。

27
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,220
零三年咧，我哋會進一步咧做一啲加強嘅措施嚟到幫助。

28
00:04:45,530 --> 00:05:05,540
少數族人士咧係就業嘅，咁呢啲包括咧，我哋會好積極噉樣去搜羅適合佢哋嘅空缺，同埋舉辦一啲專題嘅招聘會。咁嚟緊咧，誒一年咧，我哋會打算咧係為佢哋舉辦兩個大型嘅專題招聘會，同埋九個分區嘅專題招聘會。咁另外，我哋會加。

29
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:15,450
加強呢個宣傳推廣嘅工作，咁咧就鼓勵咧佢哋係用我哋嘅服務，我哋會透過民政事務總署嘅資助，佢誒。

30
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:33,820
少數族裔語言廣播嘅電台節目啦，咁同埋喺佢哋為對象嘅報章咧刊登廣告，同埋同埋利用咧香港警誒警署嘅警民關係科嘅社區網網絡嘅途徑咧，係加強向佢哋宣傳我哋嘅就係服務同埋招聘活動。

31
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:42,830
噉我哋好密會好密切留意誒，消罪人士嘅就需要，同埋確保佢哋咧係可以利用到我哋嘅服務嘅。

32
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,330
咁跟住或者請同事講一講關於做呢份工作。

33
00:05:46,990 --> 00:06:07,000
係啊，多謝主席。我會就住誒再培訓局嗰個培訓工作咧，喺度作一個簡單嘅介紹嘅。誒再培訓局咧係會誒誒為咗提升少數就業人士嗰個技能，協助佢哋就業咧，佢會開辦一啲以英語為教授語言嘅誒一啲專設課程嘅。咁喺誒二零一四一。

34
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:27,010
一五年度咧，呢啲誒誒專設課程咧係誒接近有三十行嘅，噉係會涵蓋六個唔同嘅行業，包括物業管理、保安、美容、酒店、商業、飲食同埋社會服務嘅。喺一四一五年度咧，再培訓局咧係為呢啲課程咧係預留咗八百個培訓學額嘅。

35
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:47,020
咁誒再培訓局亦都咧係誒有同一啲少數族裔團體啊、誒社福機構同埋其他嘅誒誒呢個誒持份者咧係會保持聯絡，去密切留意咧少數族裔人士喺再培訓方面嗰個需要嘅。誒或者我呢度嘅介紹到呢度。阿傅女士，冇。

36
00:06:47,020 --> 00:07:07,030
主席，噉就民政事務總署嘅工作咧，就主要透過呢一個嘅非政府機構同埋地區嘅團體啦。誒，透過我哋嘅地區嘅網絡咧，係為少數族裔人士係提供支援嘅，希望係可以幫助佢哋盡快係融入社區嘅。噉我哋現時咧係有誒多方面嘅工作，第一。

37
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:27,040
咧就係有少數族裔嘅支援嘅服務中心，我哋現現行有五間嘅就係中心啦，仲有兩間嘅分中心嘅。咁中心裏邊咧就提供唔同嘅活動啊，同埋嘅服務啦，係畀少數族裔人士嘅噉樣。咁誒其中之一間咧都係誒支援服務中心，係提供一般。

38
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:47,050
性嘅傳譯同埋翻譯嘅服務嘅，咁另外咧就係第二，我哋係有呢一個地區為本嘅融入社區嘅計劃，喺誒地區層面咧就透過唔同嘅適應課程等等咧，係希望可以幫到少數族裔嘅朋友咧係可以融入當區嘅。咁仲有我哋係有少數族裔嘅大市計劃嘅，係希望透過。

39
00:07:47,050 --> 00:08:07,060
誒少數族裔嘅朋友啦，佢哋自身可以幫翻相關嘅即係朋友，佢哋可以有誒相近嘅背景啊，或者係相近嘅經驗嘅人士咧，係由佢哋做大事，係陪翻佢哋嘅少數族裔嘅人士咧，就希望可以幫助佢哋啦嚇，介紹政府嘅服務，以及係按需要咧係進行轉介嘅。咁另外啲公

40
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:27,070
作誒，因為我哋已經喺個文件裏邊寫咗，我哋就唔詳細去傾。來年咧，就我哋有新一連串嘅新嘅措施嘅，包括係增設喺葵青區咧，係增設少數族裔人士嘅支援服務中心啦。係，亦都會喺所有嘅中心裏面係加一啲青少年嘅專責小組嘅。OK，唔該曬。咁跟住我哋跟住咧。

41
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:47,080
我哋就請啲團體代表誒講講佢哋團體嘅意見，好嘛？咁咧就係第一個係天主教勞工牧民中心代表，係多謝主席。噉我哋係天主教勞工牧民中心喺油麻地嘅，噉我哋都服務小區內嘅小業族類多年啦。噉我哋都知道咧，香港政府其實頭先大家咁多位講講就有，但係其實做就冇。

42
00:08:47,090 --> 00:09:07,100
我哋就好似咧立法會噉樣，今日好多誒，我哋少數族裔人士嚟聽，但係都係冇呢個佢哋語言嘅一啲翻譯嘅channel嘅，即係都係佢哋都係唔知道我哋今日喺度講緊乜啦。好多都OK咁誒噉。如果講翻貧窮嘅問題，就係誒，其實你扶貧其實係。

43
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:27,700
其實喺就業係係好重，係一個基礎基本嚟嘅。咁但係勞工處嗰個就業嗰個配對成功率，我哋有個數字，二零一零年八點五個percent，一路一路都仲降緊。二零一一年七點九，二零一三年降到六點二。嘅你哋嘅誒勞工處嗰個就業配對咧，根本上個配率係。

44
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
係極低，嚟嘅人少，配對到嘅人更加少。

45
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:42,430
仲有用傳譯服務，亦都好少。三年嚟用咗一百四十次嘅電話傳譯，同埋十八次嘅即場傳譯，基本上係有等於冇。

46
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:59,300
咁仲有誒喺呢個極低配率之下做嘅嘢，淨係做一個叫做就業嘅櫃枱，去到嘅南亞都係揾翻一個普通櫃枱嘅中國人去翻同佢哋講，根本做唔到個連結，做唔到佢哋嗰個。

47
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:09,140
打入唔到佢嘅社羣，咁即使喺呢個情況之下，張建中仍然係冇諗住去成立一個誒就業誒小學做嘅就業嘅就業科。

48
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:20,700
咁仲有喺在培訓方面，每日一百五十蚊嘅在培訓課程，其實係不足而令到小業族類嘅可以作進修得嚟，又可以支持個家庭。佢哋都係好多都係基層手停口停。

49
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,460
我再加上誒。

50
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:43,230
建築嘅訓練狗好多南亞朋友做緊建築業，佢佢哋一佢哋根本就係除咗金屬棚架嘅課程之外，根本冇其他嘅英文課程畀佢哋讀，就算係識英文都冇。要英文嘅翻譯，就要團做一個所謂團購，即係一齊去報，但係冇可能會有十幾二十個南亞嘅家庭願意。

51
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:57,270
冇收入噉嘅樣，同時間去讀呢啲噉樣課，咁令咁飆升，更計劃更加係得翻廣東話，一定要識中文，咁所以佢就好難去誒增加佢嘅收入，從而脱貧。

52
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,480
我哋誒先，主教育勞工務民中心認為應該要誒。

53
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:11,470
將呢個勞工及福利局嘅喺僱傭組嘅問題入邊做多啲角色，同埋再加上要增加呢個誒。

54
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:25,580
促進少數族裔平等指引嘅一個嗰個嗰個懲罰性同埋嗰個誒民責性，多謝。O.K.唔該。噉我哋每個團隊有三分鐘嘅。誒香港融樂會有限公司代表啊，李小姐。

55
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:45,950
Thank you. So on the last Monday, Unison held a seminar titled "Democracy and Minority Rights for Ethnic Minorities in Hong Kong," and one of the ethnic minority tertiary student actually told us that because they have faced

56
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:56,330
分隔開來，從幼稚園到中學，他們他們其實沒有很強的歸屬感，對香港。

57
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,000
and。

58
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:13,310
What I'm driving at driving at is to promote integration into society at large. We have to start integration at school from kindergarten, and I think it's

59
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:23,040
is um is disappointing that today we discuss integration, but education bureau representatives are not here.

60
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:43,780
also in the recent round of questions submitted by the legislative councillors to the government about the budget, that's that's a question about the proportion of students in each school being ethnic minorities and the government.

61
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:51,130
拒絕給出數據， on the basis that the goal of the education policy is to promote integration.

62
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,160
那係誒。

63
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,410
Frankly speaking, that's nonsense.

64
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,460
It's just like saying that because you want to be healthy, you don't do body checks.

65
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:21,900
So also according to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, education data about education should be provided desegregated based on various grounds of discrimination. So that will include race discrimination. So the government actually has a duty to.

66
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,160
提供數據 disaggregated by race。

67
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:40,350
And I myself and an Indian client of ours are going to the UN to lobby the committee in two weeks' time, and will raise this issue to the committee. So we hope the government would provide such information.

68
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:54,070
So secondly, the government does not seem to treat ethnic minorities as Hong Kongers, because in many of its documents, it's referring to non-Chinese speaking students.

69
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:02,560
and the local counterparts. So what they're saying is that non-Chinese speaking students are not local.

70
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,800
嗯。

71
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:13,050
I think it's really disappointing that the Hong Kong government is trying to distinguish who is a Hong Konger based on ethnicity.

72
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:33,840
In this mini movie for the population policy consultation, the government is also treating ethnic minorities as imported workers, which is wrong and fundamentally challenging the government policy for integration. Thank you。 好嘅，唔該，香港社會服務聯會羅小姐。

73
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:53,850
係誒，我係社聯代表，多謝主席。咁咧，其實我哋社聯咧有二十六間嘅機構、社會服務機構咧，都係誒恆常噉樣開會討論少數族裔嘅問題嘅。咁其實咧，我哋知道咧，香港有四十超過四十五萬嘅少數族裔人士啦。咁其中咧，其實誒佢哋可以係一個即係香港嘅社會嘅經濟同埋咧誒一個好好重要嘅資源，同埋咧。

74
00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:13,860
其實佢哋都享有誒，即係好大部誒，一部分嘅誒南亞裔居民咧，其實佢都係同樣應該擁有香港居民同樣嘅權利嘅。咁誒，但係咧，我我哋睇到咧，誒，我哋上年誒一三年年尾嘅時候都做咗個誒研究啦，即係睇緊睇翻咧南亞裔嗰個貧窮，南亞裔同埋東南亞裔嗰個誒貧窮。

75
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:33,870
同嘅數字噉，其實發覺咧係超超過三分之一嘅南亞裔嘅兒童咧，其實係喺誒貧窮線之下啦。咁同埋咧係大概有一半嘅巴基斯坦裔嘅家庭咧，係都係喺貧窮線以下嘅。咁其實可以睇到咧，其實南亞同埋誒誒，即係南亞裔誒東南亞裔嘅誒，即係嘅貧窮嘅情況咧，係比即係。

76
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:53,880
即係誒一般嘅，我哋香港嘅人士咧係更加嚴重嘅。咁誒，我哋都希望即係係誒去多啲去幫助呢啲有需要嘅人士，而係誒減少呢個即係誒誒社會嘅。即係睇翻而家嘅香港嘅誒共融政策咧，都係非常之割裂，同埋咧係誒欠缺咗宣傳啦，同埋資源或者係監管嘅。

77
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:13,890
其實咧，我哋係好期望即係誒政府會有一個全面嘅融入或者共融嘅政策咧，去策略性噉樣去達到佢個共融嘅目標嘅。噉我哋希望咧，政府檢討翻現有嘅政策啦，同埋咧係可以多啲誒策誒，讓我哋嘅少數族裔羣體啦，同埋社會服務機構一齊共同參與去制定呢個政策嘅。咁

78
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:33,900
咁誒，我哋睇見咧，其實咧頭先都係同事有講到咧，即係其實誒個paper裡面咧，政府誒準備嘅paper裡面咧，都講到呢啲誒少數族裔嘅人口咧，其實有四十五萬人，但係其中咧超過一半都係誒誒誒，即係誒啊僱傭啊家庭用工噉樣樣。其實咧某程度上，佢好似似乎咧，政府將呢一班人咧都當。

79
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:53,910
放咗佢哋係一個即係foreigner或者係個外人，佢唔需要享有香港嘅啲嘅福利，但係我哋就冇唔冇去address到咧。其實佢哋都有好多少數誒，南亞又或者少數族裔嘅香港嘅人士，佢哋同樣係有權利咧去接觸香港嘅社會服務、教育誒福利或者係攞佢嘅資訊等等。我哋發

80
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:13,920
覺咧點解佢哋會咁唔熟悉或者唔接觸唔到攞唔到香港嘅資訊咧？其中一樣主要嘅問題咧就係語言嘅困難，係啦。咁嗰我哋咧好覺得好需要咧係即係優化我哋嘅interpretation，即係我哋嘅誒傳譯同埋翻譯服務嘅。咁尤其是係講到職場傳譯嗰方面係非常之欠缺嘅。

81
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:33,930
因為喺外國裏邊嘅study誒研究咧，就發覺其實咧係職場傳譯係需要咧係有誒六成半，而係電話傳譯咧係應該係有誒三成半，呢個係比較理想。而香港誒即係民政事務總署嗰度誒提供嘅誒傳譯服務，主要都係電話嘅傳譯服務。而我哋嘅政府部門咧使用呢個。

82
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:46,010
誒即時傳譯或者傳譯服務，按照立好立法會每一個文件裏面咧係非常之低嘅嚇，噉我講到。Okay, representative from Justice Centre Hong Kong.

83
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:55,730
Good afternoon. My name is Victoria Wismesgietto. I'm the advocacy officer at Justice Centre Hong Kong, formerly Hong Kong Refugee Advice Centre.

84
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:05,390
今天，我會強調，難民和其他尋求保護的人是城市中最被 marginalised 的族裔少數羣體。

85
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:25,940
他們 arrive in Hong Kong having been forced to flee from unspeakable human rights abuses in their home countries. With the unified screening mechanism now in place since March, the Hong Kong government is going to have to get serious about long-term solutions for successful claimants in this new system. Poverty and legal limbo are not.

86
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:44,160
長遠解決，而保護申請人等待決定他們的申請，一個過程可以花費很多年，他們被迫依賴微薄的人道援助。即使最近的增補，仍使受惠者處於貧窮線以下。

87
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,280
香港政府 often emphasises that employment is the best route out of poverty.

88
00:18:50,560 --> 00:19:07,220
yet， unlike other vulnerable groups， protection claimants are legally barred from working. While discretionary temporary permission to work can be given， it is hardly ever granted by the director of immigration. We are only aware of a handful of cases.

89
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:27,520
此政策是不人道。政府正迫使人民進入可避免的 deprivation，並將他們置於不可能的狀況。無論人道援助提供給保護申請人必須是可居住的，或保護申請人必須能夠賺取自己的生活。

90
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:39,280
The vast majority are of working age. If given a choice, they would prefer to be self-reliant rather than to be forced into dependence for which they are often unfairly portrayed.

91
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,890
many were professionals in their home countries and have skills to offer.

92
00:19:44,170 --> 00:20:04,180
作為 bare minimum，政府應該允許 mandated 難民和 substantiated 殘酷聲請人工作。這些是擁有 proven 聲請的人。我們提醒政府，我們在談論一個小子集，一個已經非常小的數量的人。很明顯，香港有勞動需求，因為在許多部門。

93
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:24,190
There is a very real manpower shortage. Much discussion has been dedicated to how to resolve this problem. What the government must realise is that work is much more than about livelihoods. It is about dignity, a sense of purpose in life, a way to interact positively in the community, and a way to contribute back to society.

94
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:38,730
The status quo is unsustainable. Going forward, the subcommittee on poverty must make sure to include protection claimants' needs in these discussions. Thank you. Okay, Hong Kong Catholic Commission for Labour Affairs.

95
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:59,600
Hello, good afternoon. My name is Abbas Saira and I am working for this agency from last several years and I witness the sufferings of the EMs. The first point is that for the present generation, although most of them were born in Hong Kong and some of them are living here from generation to generation, but still the

96
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:19,610
They are considered foreigners with completely different policies in each and every government department from local Chinese origin, from immigration department to many other public services. They are having different policies for many years. EMS not cannot approach the public services as look as other local.

97
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:39,620
People can, of course, I understand that the language is the biggest barrier for that. Until last few years, the Home Affairs Bureau funded several centres to provide social service for EMs and and specialised centre interpretation service to EMs who face language difficulty.

98
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:59,630
But the government did not make any clear instructions to frontline officers in all public departments to provide interpretation service to EMS actively. So our client experience is that interpretation service is there, but the frontline officers are not willing to.

99
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:12,240
use the interpretation service actively in our daily operation. I can give you many examples and experience that we come across when the people suffered and no one helped them.

100
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:32,530
first of all I want to speak about housing department they are not providing any support to those EMs who cannot communicate in English and Chinese some of them even miss the chance for house offer and even some of their application is cancelled due to not understanding very well.

101
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:52,540
During the interview, some of them sign the documents which they don't understand properly, and and the housing department never try to arrange interpretation service them to make them understand exactly that what they are going to sign. Then I want to talk to you about student finance assistance agency. We expect.

102
00:22:52,540 --> 00:23:12,550
that many of EM even don't know that there is such kind of agency which can help them. In our research, even some of them know about that. They think that the process is quite complicated and the requirements are so difficult to fulfil. So they mostly

103
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:32,560
don't apply and the thing is that even there is not enough promotion of these schemes in different languages and also mostly the schools also don't provide any kind of sport. Then finally, I want to describe about labour department the impression.

104
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:46,660
on the usefulness of labour department among EM community, especially in seeking jobs through labour department, is quite worse. Mostly, they don't trust on labour department in looking for jobs.

105
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,040
Okay, thank you. Representative from AIM groups.

106
00:23:53,490 --> 00:24:01,200
Good afternoon, sir. I'm Amman Nawaz representing AIM AIM Group. I want to tell one.

107
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,260
我 want to tell you about my own experience. I always find a job.

108
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,880
my own network, labour department cannot help at all.

109
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,430
我係 living more than 50 year in Hong Kong when British rule was.

110
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:27,420
ruling that time, labour department was very helpful, found full full helpful. the

111
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,690
provide interpreter。

112
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:50,070
在過去三年，for E.M.的job matching rate is very low，only 6.2% and only 140 telephone and 18 face-to-face translation is provided，which is very low，and all people over 50

113
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,260
five cannot find the job.

114
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:01,210
I want to go on to help and consider keep consider of my request and our problem.

115
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,280
Thank you. Okay，誒，依靠Access to Government Services Concern Group for Hong Kong啊。

116
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,200
ethical morality。

117
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,280
Hello，good afternoon。

118
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:26,630
I'm Miss Sujata Tamang. Today I am here to represent Equal Access to Government Concern Group. I'm the only one who can speak simple English. That's why I'm here to represent.

119
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,900
實際，一 request interpretation service，但係行政部 reject us。

120
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,260
語言是最大的障礙， for ethnic minority。

121
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:51,610
To approach different public services, English and Chinese are official languages of Hong Kong, and mainly the services given in these two languages. For minorities, we have that thought that if it's on the Chinese, they must know English to communicate towards their

122
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,210
officials，但係事實是，那。

123
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,360
If。

124
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,280
但fact is that.

125
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,930
English is not the mother tongue of most of the ethnic minorities.

126
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,250
在啲國家，英語係教做一個科目，同埋，例如香港。

127
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:27,710
所以， therefore， their understanding English may even much more poor than than local. According to our experience, most of the minorities are not much educated, so they always have difficulties in approaching public services. Nowadays, Home Affairs Department is finding to force centres to provide interpretation services, but the point is that

128
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,730
why the fronted official are not?

129
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,470
following the guidance to provide a smooth approach to public services.

130
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:51,820
for ethnic minority by providing them inter translations first of all, I want to describe about the housing department which claim to provide very good services, but actually they are not providing any support for ethnic minorities who cannot speak Chinese and English.

131
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:12,370
然後我會講關於學生金融輔助局，which is to help the low income families to ease the financial burden and to encourage the students to higher studies. 我解釋，that many of the ethnic minority even don't know that there's such agency which cannot help, which can help them. Why?

132
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,900
and finally, I will describe about the labour department and their employment services.

133
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,940
印象上，勞動部門在求職。

134
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,770
我ethnic minorities is is quite worse.

135
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:37,950
other than above all situations, this poverty commissions did not speak a single word about EM needs and their difficulties, according to our experience.

136
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:47,550
This situation's very worse in comparison to Chinese. Thank you. Okay, thanks. I'm a representative from Hittun Women Art Craft Studio.

137
00:27:47,830 --> 00:28:07,840
my name is Shahin. I was I was born in Hong Kong, but I grow up in Pakistan. I completed my education in Pakistan. Today I'm presenting the EM group, Hidden Woman Art Craft Group, and I I want to talk EM women employment rate. It's 12.4%. It's very low.

138
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:22,940
因為我們唔 have 足夠機會做呢個 job，即係 where 我們可以 follow 我們 culture 和 maintain 我們 religion，就係因為我哋唔可以 get 任何 job 喺 Hong Kong，因為，即係。

139
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:43,440
我有我 own experience。我有個 good 質ification in Pakistan。我 done bachelor of art degree，但係我 work as a assistant or as a helper in a salon，因為佢哋 think 係我哋唔識 Chinese，and my my salary 係 7,000。係 so less， and it's so embarrassing。

140
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,530
for me, because my qualification didn't match with my job level.

141
00:28:48,810 --> 00:29:08,820
所以那係為咗我哋喺香港面臨咁多困難，去揾份工，唔單止係語言。當我哋去面試，佢哋會問：你識唔識中文？如果我話唔識中文，佢哋會問：你有冇經驗？如果我話冇經驗，佢哋會問：你點解著呢？

142
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,770
呢個scarf。

143
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:30,060
They will talk about culture as well. So in the end, they will say to us, you don't have experience, you don't know Chinese, so you don't have job for you. So it's really like a so so hard to find the job for the woman in Hong Kong. I really want that government do something.

144
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:50,070
about and give us the chance that we go and without the without they give us the chance we can't get any experience. So I really want government see them and give us the chance to do the jobs and follow our culture and follow our religions. Thank you. Thank you. 隋生紅議員。

145
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,480
啊！香港善工會麥理浩夫人中心，陳生。

146
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,620
係唔該曬主席，各位議員。

147
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:03,630
誒頭先一路聽誒幾位嘅朋友一齊講，同埋聽勞工署嘅同事講嘅時候，就聽得都幾傷心嘅，因為咧。

148
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,770
誒農工署而家事實上咧，佢有做一啲所謂。

149
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:21,190
誒E.M.嘅job fair嘅，即係啲即係招聘會啊。但實際嘅運作，我想同大家講係點嘅咧。因為我哋誒有同勞工處同事傾開，噉我實際見到嘅情況就係嗰啲job fair好多時都係一兩份工嚟。

150
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:41,710
噉我都問過嗰啲負責搞嘅同事咧，佢都我哋都有聯絡，噉佢就話都想我啲南亞嘅朋友一齊去。噉我就話點解得一兩份工咁少嘅？有時兩三份工咁少，噉佢就話其實佢哋嘅方法咧，只係要scan下有邊啲工作咧係所謂冇語言要求，佢係將佢group埋一齊。咁如果嗰期冇咧，咪得一兩個鐘。

151
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,240
咯，嗰期好啲咪有兩三個工作咯。

152
00:30:44,520 --> 00:31:04,530
嗱噉，我覺得當時已經同佢講，可唔可以有啲方法係？不如我哋試下幫手誒，就聯係多啲僱主，揾啲有興趣僱主一齊，然後先咁做，而唔係等啲人入一啲誒叫做即招聘廣告。你純粹只係甩樓佢，然後請僱主嚟咧噉樣。咁但係呢方面一路都冇回應，咁所以我係收咗好冇錯係成日都收到一啲噉嘅紙咧。

153
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,790
係為有勞工處嘅藍馬瑞嘅一啲所謂job fair嚟嘅，但事實上嘅情景就係頭先講嗰種。

154
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:18,510
咁呢度真係可以做多啲。另外一點係真係令人好失望嘅咧，就係因為其實誒好多部門都開始有做，包括民政處都有做嘅，就係其實咧。

155
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:38,850
誒勞工處其中一個拗法咧，就係話點解佢哋連一個藍馬瑞嘅童工都冇，甚至連藍馬瑞嘅兼職童工都冇，甚至係連一啲大市計劃都冇。噉啊，理由就係話咧，誒好少藍馬瑞嘅人向嗰度求職嘅噉樣。噉我想講呢個雞同蛋嘅問題嚟嘅，就係因為你冇一啲能夠同佢哋同聲同氣用佢用等佢哋容易啲去。

156
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:58,860
即係用到服務嘅人喺度嘅話咧，佢就好難有效到使用個服務，因為睇翻我哋好啲數字裏面見到嗱，我哋朋友嗰個失業率啊、誒持續製本都係相當之，即係失業本好高，持續製本相對低。咁呢個情況都係嚟自其實個勞工需求好大嘅。其實我想講埋咧，連輸入勞動都有影響嘅，而家一路成日話即係有廿六種工。

157
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:18,870
種係咪啊？即係會嚟緊會簡化咩勞工程序？其實好多男嘅朋友有興趣去受呢啲訓練，有興趣去做呢啲工嘅，但係佢哋知唔知咧？今個議員就讓佢哋唔知道。咁所以希望即係立法會議員可以敦敦促下勞工處，希望做件事做一啲嘢，可唔可以即係請翻男嘅去同工啊？可唔可以真係做一啲job fair嗰陣係主動聯？

158
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,020
落啲僱主去傾下咩job啱佢哋，而唔係住去疲憊去等咧噉樣。

159
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,900
咁另外一方面咧，其實我哋都見到有好多嘅問題都仲需要去處理，咁例如即係。

160
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:38,000
關愛基金上邊咧，如果關愛基金做咗好多好嘅工作，但係佢哋就人手安排有啲奇怪啊。例如見到有啲基金咧，佢係三人以上嘅錢係一樣嘅。

161
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:48,590
但係大家知，難買家庭好多時係四至八人家庭都好多。如果你三個人畀一百蚊捐助佢，十個人畀一百蚊捐助佢，其實對十個人家庭嚟講，根本就係杯水車薪得嚟好唔夠。

162
00:32:48,870 --> 00:33:08,880
咁所以我哋希望咧，另外都誒呼籲翻政府咧，其實警方做緊啲嘢嘅，希望政府都呼籲翻所有嘅部門咧，都考慮翻。而家入職嘅時候咧，可以呼籲多啲嘅誒部門咧，檢視下佢哋嘅語言嘅需求啊。因為而家好多語部門咧，其實請員嘅時候有個中文考試畀啲難買嘅朋友，但係咪份份工喺個政府裏邊都係咁？

163
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:22,580
需要中文嘅讀寫嘅咧，定係其實有啲公可以中文嘅要求水平會低啲嘅咧，佢希望公務員事務局可以牽頭做一啲嘢去檢視翻呢個情況，主動讓多啲南亞嘅朋友加入翻公務員嘅隊伍咯。咁唔該，主席。好唔該。誒葵涌青山寺。

164
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,330
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

165
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:35,280
我認為三分鐘其實真係唔夠，甚至名問題，民族少數。

166
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:53,370
基本上，政府，它不是不可否認的，政府有在做，也正在做，為族裔少數民眾，我們也分享和享受一些地方，例如醫院。

167
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:01,110
但係，我諗，有好多其他嘢。ethnic minorities need government attention.

168
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:21,400
For example, like like I am from Pakistan, we have basic education of Quran and prayers for the children, and we are always doing it on our self help basis. So there are some government states.

169
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:32,360
where we it is impossible to find a place where we can educate these children and we cannot send them too far away in order to avoid accidents.

170
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:52,920
Number two, the housing is also a big problem for ethnic minority. At present moment, everything the rents are risen very much, and as in ethnic minorities, usually the breadwinners are only one or two.

171
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:08,810
所以，他們不能，他們不能 cope  with 個 situation。如果他們 pay 個 rent，他們不能 eat 好，他們不能 educate 個 children 好。所以，政府和特別係 housing 部門，應該

172
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:19,670
have I think should make a programme for ethnic minorities with with difficulties to have a special arrangement for them.

173
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:39,960
and also I think beside this there should be special arrange programmes for the ethnic minorities teenagers who left behind in the school who left the school about thirteen years to fifteen years or.

174
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:59,970
或before eighteen years，因為這些children cannot go to school，continue their studies，and they can also not work in many，according to the labour law。所以這些people are hanging around with the people who are just misuse them。所以

175
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:15,270
There should be some programmes which should be which is especially arranged for these youngsters to be trained, and then tomorrow they can help in the society as a I mean useful contributor.

176
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:31,080
and also I think the language barrier for for ethnic minorities, there should I I think should be also deal with. Thank you very much. Okay, thanks.繼續交嚟每位代表。

177
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,790
冇理，誒舞蹈誒，印度協會。

178
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:57,300
Hello, thank you and good afternoon. My name is Karvikatani and I represent the India Association of Hong Kong. Now, I've been listening to my peers speak about the some issues to support ethnic minorities in relation to employment and integration into community, and the general consensus is that it is mainly a language.

179
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:17,310
Having growing up in Hong Kong for the past thirty odd years, I found that previously that this wasn't an issue because English seemed to be the main language through school, maybe even even through university. Now, recently, I dare say after ninety seven, it's

180
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:37,320
It's been a problem that people have started to use Cantonese a lot more and Mandarin. Now, what was important about Hong Kong was its international presence. Now, there has been a really, really large influx of mainland people coming into Hong Kong. So, I understand that's a huge issue as well. Whereas

181
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:57,330
The ethnic minorities isn't isn't gradually getting that much more people. However, I believe that the government can do something in regards to just spoken and listening Chinese in in government jobs. That's only needed where.

182
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:16,800
Whereas do we really need written and a reading Chinese in those jobs? I personally don't think so, and on behalf of the ethnic minorities, I don't think so either. It is a teamwork that we that what we do in Hong Kong. Now.

183
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:37,090
Another point is, I believe the government should be taking more initiative to play to play a proactive role in employing ethnic minority people, as it does seem to be getting less and less. Labour Department, I I can't see any. Even in my own job, I've been doing engineering for ten, fifteen odd years.

184
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:57,100
I've been in the finance industry, and people I see are predominantly either Chinese, Hong Kong Chinese or Mandarin. So, you know, there is a large presence, a few hundred thousand ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, and I believe they will provide a vital role.

185
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:17,110
In in getting Hong Kong as an international hub, so I do urge the government to again concentrate on on the language, educating the ethnic minorities on spoken and listening Cantonese to integrate them into into society more. Thank you. Thanks. International.

186
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,080
《Human Rights Forum》代表。

187
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:25,200
Thank you, Chairman. My name is Asma and I am representing International Human Rights Forum.

188
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,550
Today, I will share my views regarding employment issue.

189
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:44,750
As we know that EM facing considerable considerable problems in this regard, I think the major problem in this regard is a language barrier.

190
00:39:45,320 --> 00:40:00,110
And government should pay more attention in this regard. Due to language barrier, E.M. members of ethnic minorities facing difficulties in finding jobs.

191
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,160
and。

192
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:23,680
You know, if you you as my sister before mentioned that she's a university graduate and she she just got the salon assistant job, and I one of my friend he's also university graduate and he was bachelor in comp.

193
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,320
農業。

194
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:44,610
and he he's a driver at the moment, so most of university graduates are working as a construction worker as well here in Hong Kong, because their degrees are not acceptable here in Hong Kong. Or the the major issue is the language issue. So due to

195
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,270
language barrier， they cannot get the proper jobs。

196
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:56,510
所以我認為政府應該 pay more attention on this issue and

197
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:16,840
The secondly, I want to raise that many many EM members would like to start their own business, self employment. I'm talking about the self employment. So the government should start some scheme for those who want to be self employed, and

198
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,800
For example, some

199
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:37,780
some loan schemes to start their business or some some some other kind of training or support to how to start a small scale business in Hong Kong, so this this would also be helpful for to them.

200
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,720
and。

201
00:41:43,740 --> 00:42:00,060
Yeah, further that in in civil service government should relax the job criteria, especially sub. I don't think so that all the jobs need the

202
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,020
means high level fluency in Chinese. Some joes maybe not. So.

203
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:28,360
If job to job, government can relax the criteria in relation with the language, so many ethnic minorities members can can have opportunity to get those jobs. Thank you very much. Thanks. Representative from Pakistan Women Association.

204
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,250
香港。

205
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,130
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Shazia Gultraid. I'm General Secretary of Pakistan Women Association of Hong Kong.

206
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,280
The association.

207
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:48,050
我係，我係，滿意嚟講，這個議題，措施，嚟支持族裔少數，喺關聯到就業同埋融入社區。

208
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:58,590
我們會帶出一些由族裔少數羣體面對的問題，就該議題尋求可能的解決途徑，以應對不斷增高的逆境。

209
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:16,150
Starting off, I would like to arouse the issue of importance of speaking and understanding Cantonese that has on us ethnic minorities for applying job here in Hong Kong. The major difficulties faced are the language barriers that are put between us and the local Chinese.

210
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,550
hence many of us hesitate to communicate with our associates and even neighbours.

211
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:31,510
nowadays finding a job with stable income to support a household is becoming rather difficult due to the requirements based on the language.

212
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:42,280
also， lots of firms and companies require skilled workers to do the job given， and hence many minorities are left out as they do not have the skill。

213
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:51,680
to do it. Even so, the training that are given under English or Cantonese medium, which may not be understandable to them.

214
00:43:51,960 --> 00:44:00,660
all of these restricted requirements force them to heavily rely on CSSA in order to fulfil their daily necessities.

215
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:13,670
The outcome is that ethnic families live low-income lives with comparatively low standard of living and having low and stagnant social mobility and social cohesions.

216
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,510
我們會想建議政府鬆綁本地工作的要求。

217
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:28,730
either it that we language dressing code or either think so that more ethnic minorities will have chance to work and help in improving Hong Kong economy.

218
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:49,060
Last but not the least, our Pakistan Woman Association is also helping Pakistan women and children by providing various educational activities, such as English Cantonese language classes, talks on health, employment-related programmes, so that to help them ease any challenges being raised in the society to become.

219
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,020
獨立。

220
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,190
然而，我們希望，這樣可以喺更大嘅規模。

221
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:04,680
also， we request that the government can create more job opportunities for ethnic minorities。 all of all of these will be effective。

222
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:17,750
As when more of us start to work, it can help us better integrate into the society. Thank you. Michael, representative from Jammu Kashmir Association. Good afternoon, everybody.

223
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:26,630
My name is Rayhan Gulfrid and I'm and it's my pleasure to present the Jammu Kashmir Association of Hong Kong as vice president.

224
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:35,140
我榮幸被邀請討論如何改善香港社會對ethnic minorities的融入。

225
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,960
我完成咗我的 studies in UK， and decided to come to Hong Kong to settle down.

226
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:47,870
我 felt, always felt that Hong Kong is my home, as my family had lived here for forty years.

227
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:56,130
over forty years, Hong Kong is a place of. I believe that Hong Kong is a place of great opportunities for everyone.

228
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:11,520
When I joined the Jammu Kashmir Association, which represents large part of Pakistani community in Hong Kong, we represent mainly people from Kashmir in Hong Kong. There are about 20,000 people living in Hong Kong from Kashmir.

229
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:18,660
most of them are uneducated, they cannot read via Chinese, thus they are in low-paid jobs.

230
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,690
still you know whatever they can do they they contribute to the Hong Kong society.

231
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:41,720
most of the parents I've spoken to or even myself I've experienced that when you I wanted my children to come here to study in the schools and when I went to find places for them in the schools most of the Chinese school I wanted my children to go to Chinese school but

232
00:46:42,040 --> 00:47:02,050
All the reply I get is because your children are from UK, it'll be very difficult for them to understand Chinese, read or write Chinese. So you know, you rather put your children in international schools. So I was discouraged. That was not my aim. I came here to let my children know.

233
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,640
learn Chinese and integrate into Hong Kong society.

234
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:15,880
And a lot of parents are like me. They feel the same. Same. They're they're they're feeling the same situation.

235
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,110
我 believe that.

236
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:34,200
Well, it is crucial that migrants take an effective role in the integration process. This is only possible when existing structures are not so rigid as to render agency fertile.

237
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:41,030
successful integration requires meaningful interaction between migrants and the receiving societies.

238
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:54,260
which means integration must be conceived as two-way process. Such process will change not only the migrant's perspective and the way of life, but also effective structure change in the receiving society.

239
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:14,550
在民主社會，such change will not be perceived as a threat to stability, but as part of the flexibility and openness of a society which is constantly developing, striving for greater equality and more opportunity for all people. Democracy is based

240
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:34,880
on the diversity of often conflicting views, needs, values, expression and identities to which migrants and other minorities add another facet. Thank you。好唔該，誒基督教服務處陳理事。唔誒，唔該主席。誒，我我自己覺得咧，即係其實好高興今日會討論嗰個誒少數族裔integration嘅問題，但

241
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:54,890
我覺得頭先誒講誒點樣融入少數族裔第一樣嘢，我諗要定性個理念同埋個價值觀。我哋點睇少數族裔係啲咩人？最近我就睇咗嗰個人口政策文件，我自己覺得就係少數族裔成為咗某一啲人手短缺行業嘅，即係即係涉場嘅啫。因為唔夠人，所以要佢。但係我自己覺得，如果講緊融合嘅話咧，我哋就應該試。

242
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:14,900
佢為本港重要嘅資源嚟嘅，要畀佢發展。然後第二樣嘢咧就係誒，我其實過去嗰兩年喺唔同嘅場合去討論一啲社會福利嘅發展嘅時候咧，就某處就我就講一啲關於少數族裔嘅嘢啦。就某處嘅高級官員都會同我回應咧，就話誒唔關我事喎，係第二個處嘅負責嘅噉樣。噉我自己覺得而家。

243
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:34,910
最缺乏係咩咧？一個全面嘅少數族裔共融嘅政策喺香港，於是乎出現嘅時候咧，而家好多個服務咧都係割裂嘅，然後咧係短期嘅，即係頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳。噉我自己覺得噉樣係唔OK嘅。頭先我所講個例子，正正就反映咗部門同部門之間、局同局之間冇溝通。咁呢個係要。

244
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:54,920
處理嘅另一樣嘢喺二零一零年嘅時候咧，其實誒C.M.A.B.好好嘅。我自己覺得係出咗一份即係誒誒admin guideline啦。其實而家已經有十四個唔同嘅部門嚟緊，會有廿二個都會出佢哋嘅清單啦。雖然出咗個清單，但係係唔係就係大家就照住個清單執約然後去做咧？誒呢個我有懷疑，因為二零一年零年出而家二。

245
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:14,930
零一四年，但係我未見到有任何即係公開地話畀我哋聽，每一個誒部門係做成點啊。咁唔係好visible，我覺得呢件事希望可以知道。咁而其實喺頭先有社聯嘅同事講啦，我哋曾經喺二零一三年做過一個問卷調查。其實我自己係社會福利界，所以就關於社會福利就做咗一啲NGO嘅同事嘅調查，三百七。

246
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:34,940
十六份問卷裏邊有四十幾個percent嘅同事話：我冇聽過社署出過一份memo咧，係關於依份admin guideline㗎。噉我自己都覺得好遺憾啊，因為其實我哋誒寫社署唔係淨係自己，即係誒自己做服務，我亦都畀咗好多錢，即係冧心關落去畀誒NGO做，但係就冇積極咁去推動去NGO。

247
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:54,950
真係可以落實呢個戒奶噉。另外第二樣嘢咧，就我自己覺得咧，service provider根本就係把關嘅。有陣時好多即係小數族用唔用到服務，就係睇service provider有冇嗰個文化嘅敏感度，同埋佢願唔願意用。但係喺好多時候，我哋就遇到咧，就係冇文化敏感度，亦都唔願意用，又或者有陣時會同我講啊，我唔識。

248
00:50:54,950 --> 00:51:14,960
英文嘅，所以我就唔用啦，或者太夜啦，時間應該咧就係誒冇乜時間，好忙啦，所以我又唔用噉。而我哋其實嗰份問卷調查，同樣地係發現四十幾個percent嘅N.G.O同事係從來冇上過任何嘅文化敏感度訓練㗎。咁其實係好影響點解頭先同事講話，誒點解佢哋會唔用翻譯服務咧？梗係嗱都冇訓練咁咪。

249
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:31,410
知咯，咁另外一點我好想提咧，就係而家嘅好多少數族裔服務，好似好多服務畀佢哋噉，但係除咗割裂之外咧，就係短期㗎。就算係政府部門畀嘅錢咧，都係以兩年做一個review㗎。噉我自己覺得噉樣嘅唔穩定嘅資源咧，係好影響個服務嘅發展嘅。

250
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:51,740
好嘅，唔該。誒仁愛堂社區中心代表馬生，係多謝主席。噉啊，誒我哋中心咧，其實係一間喺地區做服務嘅機構嚟，咁所以由陣間講啲內容比較集中喺地區入邊，我見到嘅狀況。咁頭先會同同講咧，就係成個政策其實今呢個小組雖然講扶貧咧，但係我諗講少俗語，其實係一個融合政策。

251
00:51:51,740 --> 00:52:11,750
入邊係講緊佢哋就學、講緊就業、講緊後生仔生涯規劃、住嘅生活配套呢堆嘅範，就全部其實都係一個誒跨國跨部門嘅一個issue嚟嘅。但係其實我哋而家冇呢個政策，於是乎咧唔同局唔同部門咧就各自自己做啲功夫，就出現頭先嗰啲好零散嘅狀況。咁但係我都好緊。

252
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:31,760
要喺我哋服務入邊，如果呢啲生活配套或者頭先Up嘅內容入邊咧，幫到佢哋咧，其實脱貧咧，其實係即係個力度咧會大好多。第二樣嘢咧，頭先誒都有同事又講咧，就係其實每年政府咧，我當然我哋都有話picture嘅，其實政府畀好多錢，我哋有幾對嘅消弱支援中心啦，亦都有啲機構咧，有啲project做緊消弱嘅服。

253
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:40,780
冇，但係其實成個指標喺邊啊？我哋講緊嘅係outcome，唔係output，即係唔係講緊有幾多人嚟咗活動，或者哇個活動有幾大，有幾多嘉賓嚟咗嘢。

254
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:59,080
真真正正有幾多個人咧？覺得有呢啲服務之後，佢哋自己覺得改變咗。誒，引用一個簡單例子，就係我哋中心有啲少數嘅婦女咧，其實幫我哋手做一啲主席班啊、手攰班啊，教我哋啲中國人去講佢哋rudu呢啲話。咁其實佢哋feedback翻咧，就係佢哋好開心，原來咧。

255
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:19,370
誒未參加呢啲誒活動之前咧，佢冇諗過咁多中國人對佢哋有興趣，想了解佢哋多啲。但係佢做完之後覺得好開心咧，因為佢覺得家下咧真係社區分子，即係有人去關心我哋，或者對我哋文化瞭解多啲。咁呢個就係講嘅勾襟。但係我哋整整體嘅政策其實有冇呢類似成效指標，即係可以即係提供咧？我諗。

256
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,510
變咗，同事去寫一啲proposal，就起碼都。

257
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:42,800
第二樣可以跟到位，其實唔同嘅服務嘅提供者咧，可以有一個比較即係聚焦啲嘅做法。第二樣嘢，頭先同事都有講咧，就係喺地區入邊嗰個協調。噉我諗好多時，我哋攞HAD或HAB嘅錢做嘅單位，其實都係社署資助單位，但係其實同一時間咧，好多時誒未必好多好協調嘅功夫嘅。可唔可以地區入邊兩個專？

258
00:53:42,800 --> 00:54:02,810
員咧可以做一啲服務上面協調，唔需要就係其實喺區咧誒話聲稱自己做E.M. service，其實好多單位嘅。其實我哋自己都有個小聯盟，但係其實大家都喺唔同範圍邊咧做緊唔同嘅功夫。咁其實啊，每個地區可以做多少少功夫係純粹嘅，即係我哋自己搞咧。第三樣嘢，頭先同事都提到就係啲project真係好短期，短到點？

259
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:17,310
引用一個例子就係誒，舊年咧，我哋一路年頭由二月、三月問啊，有冇project錢啊噉樣，唔冇，未知道，唔清楚噉啊，等等等噉啊，等到四月冇聲氣，咁梗係我哋服務要做，就自己揾資源啦。

260
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:37,600
好啦，噉我係申請咗其他資源嘅，去到七月突然間打畀我哋話：家有資源啊，你申請預咗，你申請啦。於是乎咧，八月批，但係第二年嘅二月要埋數。但係咧，其實得幾個月，我哋係好好難，即係突然間其實夠錢係大嘅，我哋都想成日都話錢咧用我哋想，我哋希望咧用喺服務對象身上，而唔係搞一啲大活動咧。

261
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:57,610
揈咗啲錢佢噉啊！呢幾點我係想分享嘅，唔該曬。OK，唔該誒，張思榮小姐，係各位好誒。其實咧，我咧就覺得喺香港咧，你見到好多外國人嚟咗香港生活咗十幾年咧，都唔識講中文，佢都揾到嘢做，或者揾到份好好嘅工作，可以攞到份好好。

262
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,830
好嘅人工。

263
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:08,970
真係好多好多外國嚟香港做嘢都唔識講中文嘅喎，咁噉你諗下，我覺得香港講求咩咧？你有能力，你有qualification，你有一個專業資格。

264
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:29,260
你唔識中文，唔識廣東話都可以做到喎。所以個核心問題係乜嘢咧？核心問題咧，可能其實講真，我覺得政府已經做得好好啦，投放好多資源。你睇幾多個處啊？雖然好多話話分工點樣樣都好，但係你起碼有勞工福利局、勞工處、僱員再培訓局、公務事務員、警務處，請教民政。

265
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:49,270
係嘛？即係其實政府係投放咗好多資源，出咗好多力去幫大家，依個係。不過問題就可能咧就要針對性，就話因為一向嚟咧亞族裔嗰啲咧就可能畀人感覺就做啲工作比較基層嘅。但係點樣樣可以幫佢哋？政府當局可能諗下點樣幫佢提升佢嘅技能咧？所以先個技能唔係話就係叫佢做一。

266
00:55:49,270 --> 00:56:01,320
啲執頭執尾啊！啲嗰啲技能，而係真係可能考取一個一個專業資格，例如會計啊、法律啊，點樣幫佢哋啦？因為佢哋有一個好好嘅英文嘅水準啊嘛，係嘛？依個係佢哋嘅優勢嚟嘅喎，依個係佢優勢嚟嘅喎。

267
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:22,020
咁同埋咧，第二樣嘢咧，即係我我因為我知道咧，因為我知好多阿鋭啲咧，可能讀嗰啲學校咧，即係集中於係可能地理亞好多呢啲，或者某啲學校噉樣。我有好多朋友，我都好中意同啲阿鋭做朋友，好多咧都係因為因為佢哋未必覺得啊，都係跟翻自己個圈子，就同翻嗰個自己圈子。

268
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,070
所以覺得有時咧就。

269
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:44,360
即係我覺得咧，即係一方面政府有提出援，即係誒畀資源，但另一方面，我覺得阿俊玉、阿阿俊誒朋友咧，都可能要自己主動或者點樣去學中文。香港個好開放嘅城市，睇報紙、上網係好方便嘅。你睇而家誒無線新聞嗰個有個女女主持。

270
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:55,150
佢都係巴基斯坦係咪？可能亞裔，但係佢講中文講得好好係嘛？所以我覺得在乎係誒要學習，或者要在乎自己爭取，因為。

271
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,100
我覺得咧，誒。

272
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:14,500
我覺得咧，即係政府咧，可能如果我頭先即係講咗一樣嘢，就可能只係一個方面，就話點樣樣提升佢哋嘅個專業資格呢方面。但係語言咧，我睇到政府已經喺民政啊好多好多渠道啊，已經有好多個資，即係擺咗好多嘅投放喺度。

273
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:34,800
咁同埋咧，我覺得可能咧，由年輕嘅呢一代咧，我諗係呢一代開始咧，應該個受即係可能老嗰代四五十代嗰年代六十，即係嗰年代可能可能唔識中文都唔出奇。但係我相信而家後生嘅而家即係我哋而家讀書一代嘅後生仔咧，應該語言上應該好多都應該都應。

274
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:45,770
應該問題不大，但係可能如果係噉，可能教即係可能政府可能喺一啲嘅學校啊，可能就冇分得咁開啊。邊個係啊？香港學生邊個噉樣？

275
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:51,180
again，各位，誒，我係代表從The Poly Union Church。

276
00:57:51,710 --> 00:58:03,980
Hello, good afternoon, Chairman and ladies and gentlemen. I'm Raju Barali from Nepali Union Church as well as Nepalese community.

277
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:12,760
The Nepalese community are in Hong Kong almost two decades, and most of the father.

278
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,500
They working for the construction.

279
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:19,430
and it's quite well.

280
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,680
但 nowadays，what happening since two decades?

281
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,690
Their children born in Hong Kong.

282
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,920
and many children, they migrate.

283
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,690
while they are in teenage.

284
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,080
They.

285
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,300
are trying to integrate in Hong Kong.

286
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:47,270
those children studied in Hong Kong, and finish their high school.

287
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:51,580
and they are above 18 years old.

288
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,660
and after that.

289
00:58:54,460 --> 00:59:14,470
The student went to EME school, English speaking school, but they didn't had a good opportunity to learn the Cantonese language. Because of that things, the nowadays our next generation, second generation, they confronting the language.

290
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:21,030
barrier very severely, so they could not find the proper job. Even they

291
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:40,420
could not enter into the university, and even the vocational training they could not get properly because most of the vocational training is being provided in Cantonese language and some other skilful jobs in Hong Kong. So finally.

292
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,150
our。

293
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,320
children，I mean the next generation，the young people。

294
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,260
They don't see.

295
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,530
Hope in Hong Kong.

296
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:57,050
They don't feel hope in Hong Kong. So because of that reason.

297
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:07,090
many of our Nepalese children, according to the Chinese University statistic, they are.

298
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,980
abusing drugs because of

299
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,740
hopelessness。

300
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,370
and they don't see the future in Hong Kong.

301
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:26,780
所以，如果發生， continue， 他們係香港的公民，所以呢，呢個會係一個問題。

302
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:33,220
to Nepalese community to Hong Kong government as well, so because of that reason.

303
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,390
How Hong Kong government see these youth?

304
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,510
and this young generation to integrate.

305
01:00:42,790 --> 01:01:01,270
with their skilful language in Hong Kong community, that they can have their prosperous life and they can built up quite positive mind in Hong Kong. Thank you very much for this precious time. Okay, thank you.誒潘永樂先生。

306
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,440
係唔該，主席、立法會議員嚇。

307
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:23,730
咁咧喺呢十年裏邊接觸啲少數族裔青年咧，咁其實睇到佢哋好大嘅改變。佢哋對佢哋工種嘅要求，對佢哋社區參與，其實已經好唔同。以往可能做construction security，今日佢好想做老師、社工、police man、accountant、lawyer，甚至係立法會議員嚇。咁誒對社會福利，其實佢已經唔想。

308
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:43,740
在蛇曬病種，佢哋希望可以參與社會，去去對政策畀意見，就好似早前佢哋對一啲誒population policy啊或者誒long-term housing policy佢哋畀意見一樣。所以其實好更加著重就係話，其實佢哋希望可點樣喺社區同埋公民同埋政治嘅參與，因為當然啦，要佢哋。

309
01:01:43,740 --> 01:02:03,750
參與其實唔容易，因為係一個結構性問題，包括牽涉誒教政策、語言政策同埋公共參與嘅政策。噉我諗詳細，我諗詳細唔講。我好第一好支持，即係公務員嗰個個中文入職要求一定要relax啦，特別係即係誒中文嘅書寫同埋製造多啲個個誒誒職位畀佢哋去唔同嘅部門工作啦。我。

310
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:13,590
咁最緊，我想講兩點就係第二就係話喺諮詢同埋法定機構，其實香港咧有四百六十個諮詢同埋法定機構，包括有三千九百人。

311
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:33,880
即係我都好質疑，究竟有幾多個小數族裔嘅代表喺中間？就算佢哋有少部分係被委任嘅，例如可能E.O.C.啊，例如可能D.C.某啲Ethnic Affairs啊，喺我接觸嘅裏邊咧，其實佢大部大部分咧都係啲即係誒一啲商家，佢哋未必即係反映到一啲基層即係市民喺教育啊、反歧視啊或者公眾參與個。

312
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,540
聲音。

313
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:52,960
噉我個問題就係究竟即係第一有幾有幾多個委任啦嚇，同埋即係佢係委任啲乜嘢代表啦嚇。噉我參考翻其實有一個性別嘅基準比例，例如誒女士就起碼有三十percent啦。究竟可唔可以喺一個種族嗰個基準做一個比例，按翻佢嘅population即係可能六七個percent啦？

314
01:02:53,240 --> 01:03:13,250
咁第三問題，我想好想講H.A.D，即係嗰啲support service centre。當然啦，有係好嘅，但係我諗即係喺喺佢現有嘅language class啊，或者social integration program裏邊，成日都係講頭先講嘅係講數字，究竟係咪真係冇講過一啲成效？係咪真正幫到佢哋社區參與啊公民嘅參與、十月政治嘅參與，噉樣容？

315
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,130
入香港咧。

316
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:34,440
咁好，前年好意外咧，就知道有一個機構咧。誒同一時間就bit咗兩個誒service centre。咁咧，你睇到其實佢喺少數做嘅經驗係相當少，但係咧佢唯一個長處咧，所謂長處咧個背景就係好親中、好親建制嘅機構。噉佢哋做嘅服務咧，就通常一入會咧就畀誒Ocean Particip啊。

317
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,860
誒誒Disneyland ticket啦，跟住又如果你有介紹咧，又畀埋啲parking shop ticket嚟㗎。

318
01:03:40,450 --> 01:04:00,460
誒又唔鼓勵人哋做義工啊！咁究究竟，究竟呢啲做法係咪幫助緊人哋？即係即助人自助，或者我哋講嘅充權，或者係參與社區咧嚇？究竟如果真係佢嚟緊喺個葵青個區嗰個centre裏邊，仍然係繼續靠靠呢啲可能人際拉攏啊，或者親中親建制，而唔睇佢哋服務個。

319
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:11,200
標準服務嗰個少少數族嘅網絡嘅話，究竟會唔會覺得社福界被滲透？唔係睇個質素咧。唔該，唔該，誒工黨代表林生，好多謝主席。

320
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:23,250
誒，我哋工黨認為其實誒鼓勵少數族裔就業嘅政策咧，唔係淨係喊口號式嘅，係真係要有完善嘅一套政策咧去推行至得。

321
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:43,600
噉啊！香港政府作為即係香港最大嘅僱主，究竟有冇做過實際嘅工作咧？去推動即係或者係聘請少數族裔人士咧？我喺度舉兩個例子，即係政府咧係即係今次畀咗啲資料我哋啦嚇。咁經務處咧就係請咗十五個嘅少數族裔嘅人士咧，係。

322
01:04:43,600 --> 01:05:03,610
係擔任社區聯絡主任嘅，但係誒政府一直以嚟咧都冇提供過誒，究竟喺公務員團隊裏邊有幾多少數族裔嘅人士佔嘅比例係幾多？噉啊，同時間咧警隊亦都冇提供過咧每年投考誒警隊嘅少數族裔人士有幾多，同埋咧成功。

323
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:23,620
取錄嘅人數係幾多？據我所所知咧，好多少少族裔嘅朋友咧，佢其實佢哋都好想考警隊嘅，但係咧就係礙於佢哋係喺誒應徵嘅時候咧，嗰個中文嘅筆試咧係通過唔到啊，所以其實其實佢哋好多都好夢，即係好夢成空。噉我哋再睇下情教處，情教處喺二零一

324
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:33,750
一年嘅九月係取消咗二級請教助理嘅筆試嘅制度嘅，咁誒之後佢哋請咗五個嘅二級請教助理。

325
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:54,040
咁點解警務處又唔能夠係效法城教署咁做咧？咁喺二零一四年一月二十號咧，誒警務處嘅代表回答李卓仁議員嘅提問嘅時候就講到，警隊嘅甄選程序咧必須或一唔能夠因為投考人係少數族裔而歧視其他人，但係咁誒其。

326
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,420
其實警隊咧有個準則咧，就係如果識得少數族裔語言咧，係得到加分嘅。

327
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:19,710
咁其實噉樣證明咧，政府其實佢哋喺招聘政策上邊咧十分之僵化同埋荒謬。點解咁講咧？誒，其實佢哋劃一嘅公平標準，就正正係為某一啲人帶來唔公道同埋唔公義，就係呢啲劃一嘅標準係。

328
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:25,480
摒除咗好多少數族裔咧，係加入警隊或者係其他政府部門嘅機會。

329
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:45,960
其實呢啲咧就係一啲好即係傳統嘅企業嘅請人嘅方針，就係餵你識嘅嘢越多越好啊！嚇，最好好使好用啊！但係咁同時間你唔好左手左腳，唔好咧增加我哋企業上面嘅負擔。咁所以其實即係我哋睇到政府喺呢方面做到有幾？

330
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:55,700
幾多？我希望政府咧，其實可以係統一佢哋，即係就住少數族裔統嘅政策，就即係就業嘅政策，同埋聘用誒嘅政策。

331
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:16,210
唔好讓部門各施各法，同埋唔好讓部門咧係一國多制。所以我想向呢個誒勞工處係提出個提問嘅，就係誒你哋喺誒二今舊年嘅十一月回答張國柱議員嘅提問嘅時候咧，就指出喺二零一零年咧誒使用勞工處就業服務咧嘅小數。

332
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:31,420
個人就有一千二百三十四人，但係咧到二零一二年咧係得翻九百八十四人成功配對嘅咧，喺二零一零年有一百零五宗，二零一二年咧係得翻六十一宗。究竟你哋嘅錢使咗去邊度？係咪用得其所？

333
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:51,720
一定要答我，唔該曬。唔該，誒香港人權監察啊，羅生係誒多謝主席。香港人權監察想指出咧，香港嘅平等機會嘅嗰個模式咧，其實係非常之誒落後嚇，只係一個投訴主導嚇。噉佢作用咧喺即係促進誒少數族裔嘅誒。

334
01:07:51,720 --> 01:08:11,730
生活啦嚇，各方面啊嚇，尤其就業啊呢啲地方咧，係冇乜大幫助啊，因為嚇你只係基本上係靠投訴嚇，然後一啲案例可能啊去做下嘅啫。咁誒，基本上面咧係冇一個啊好職一個好重要嘅職業嘅責任咧，係責成譬如有關部門啊啊涉誒。

335
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:31,740
誒誒用會用到工行資助嘅機構啊，啊會去即係認真咧去執行一啲啊消除歧視、促進平等嘅工作。咁而家香港政府啊用嘅所謂咩行政指引啊嗰啲啊誒去處理一啲啊誒種族嘅誒平等機會嘅問題嘅時候咧，你會見到咧。

336
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:51,750
咧啊，呢個誒噉嘅所謂指引咧啊誒喺亦都唔係即係成個政府適用啦啊，就算用得上咧嚇，誒都係即係誒做第一次嘅評估之後咧，就擺咗上神台嘅咁冇誒嚴格嘅一啲週期嘅檢討啊，而啲誒所以誒即使係。

337
01:08:51,750 --> 01:09:11,760
係誒誒講到啊，每個部門有啲咩嘢嘅時候，呢啲噉嘅指引咧並冇啊，帶嚟一啲咩，譬如統計數字啊，各方面嘅一啲嚇誒誒蒐集啊，誒有效噉樣使到我哋可以評估到咧啊呢啲工作嘅效能。我哋見到政府嗰啲數字咧，就只係佢提供啲咩服務，個表面上個。

338
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:31,770
就做一大堆嘢出嚟啊，而佔到少少邊嘅都話計埋落去，然後咧啊，實際上面咧對嗰個效成效而言咧，係基本上係微乎其微嘅。咁啱先亦都聽到有啲即係最直者咧啊，係以為政府做咗好多嘢啦啊，咁但係事實上咧，如果真係啊知道做開服務嘅朋友咧啊，瞭解。

339
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:36,340
睇到咧，其實少咗做業，真正係因為呢啲噉嘅所謂啊誒。

340
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:56,810
呢個作各種各樣即係政府提供你嘅服務嘅啊，所謂嘅誒誒多種嘅服務咧，實質上面啊個幫助係非常之有限。我哋亦都想指出咧啊，喺呢啲噉嘅行政指引咧，係冇完全咧係冇一個公眾嘅參與啊，同同埋獨立嘅監察嘅，結果就只係一個部門吹噓。

341
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:16,820
對自己做啲咩嘢啊嘅一啲途徑嚟嘅啫。咁喺譬如英國噉，你見到咧，譬如有啲誒佢哋嘅誒機構咧去睇啊每個啊部門啊，或者係譬如地方政府啊，啊佢哋每年嗰個計劃點樣評估佢哋係嘛有啲咩嘢造成點樣啊？咁都有一個機構噉。如果香港嘅評基會咧啊～

342
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:36,830
又似乎咧就冇一個足夠嘅資源啊，同埋權責咧，係去喺呢方面咧去啊，及住啲部門啊。更加甚者咧，我哋嗰個《總則歧視條例》咧，啊講到明咧，啊喺呢個政府嘅權力嘅行使啊啊，同埋呢個啊執行職能嘅時候咧，啊係唔適用於啊呢個政府嘅咁咁呢喺。

343
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:51,060
噉嘅情況之下咧，其實你睇到咧啊，政府自己咧係知道自己係好多嘢唔掂啊，先要咁做嘅啫。咁希望咧，政府嘅認真去檢討啊，改善翻呢啲情況啦。多謝。唔該。誒，香港巴基斯坦學生會哈博士。

344
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,200
Thank you, Chairman.

345
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:58,230
I am Dr. Muhammad Anwarul Haq from the Pakistani Students Association, Hong Kong.

346
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:07,880
Our mission of PSA is to uplift the educational and socio-economic status of Pakistani youth and community in Hong Kong.

347
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,230
它也 aims to encourage and promote multicultural society in Hong Kong through.

348
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:23,910
organising seminars on educational, religious and social cultural matters, providing meaningful activities and learning experiences for whole person development.

349
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:32,740
collaborating with the NDO schools and other stakeholders to organise various activities.

350
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:41,590
We also offer information about primary and secondary schools which accept NCCS students. Information on higher edu

351
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,810
Creation opportunities for minorities.

352
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:54,740
and we also provide advice on choosing educational institutions for NCCS students, workshops and seminars on a lot of different issues.

353
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:06,650
surrounding education of minorities and general life in Hong Kong, and we also provide recreational activities where we aim to develop leadership, voluntary spirit.

354
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,360
teamwork skills。

355
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:14,340
sportsmanship and interpersonal and intrapersonal skills in minority youth.

356
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:22,420
and we also provide advice to schools, NGOs and government departments on education and social matters of minorities.

357
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:42,770
所以語言 requirements in my opinion is a very complex issue. Government need to make adjustments so that there is positive discrimination at least for the present generation. The requirements can be tightened to the next generation. Otherwise, quoting one or two examples of ethnic minorities.

358
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,910
Learning Chinese are not good enough.

359
01:12:46,170 --> 01:13:06,180
and talking about poverty actually it's an even more complex issue. The people have been driven out of the jobs because of language barrier and high cost of living. They find it easier to rely on C S S A rather than to work. Also, baseline poverty will

360
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:23,310
有限制，因為我們家庭規模、教育機會，在我們的意見中是唯一的前進方式。這是一個非常嚴重的問題，因為它可能會將年輕人引導參與一些不健康的活動。

361
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:47,200
And one thing more that I would like to highlight is that my few suggestions, so that can we get the authentic data first. Then how many ethnic minorities actually receive CSS? Say, EM students have low motivation, spark is not there. Then except a few students.

362
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:53,530
successful example of ethnic minority professionals should be highlighted in the media properly.

363
01:13:53,910 --> 01:14:13,920
政府應該反映對EM的瞭解程度。我相信，你們知道問題比原因更嚴重。為使此成真，言語應成為現實。常言道，行動勝於言語。非常感謝。

364
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,390
得。

365
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:15,460
yes。

366
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:30,660
Hello, sir. Good afternoon. Introduction. My, the group name is Health Awareness Concern Group. Focus in interpretation service of non-Chinese people. Inter.

367
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:36,560
importance of interpretation service for non-Chinese people language problem.

368
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:50,730
higher private interpreter experience cannot communicate with doctors, nurse misunderstanding is happened. Survey sixty five per cent is of the participant don't know.

369
01:14:51,150 --> 01:15:02,350
there is no interpretation service provided by hospital authority, thus majority of them have no experience in using these.

370
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:05,580
interpretation issue， however。

371
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:15,170
Nearly half of them responded report non-difficulty when consulting medical department.

372
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:25,350
原因，most of them deal with the interpretation problem by asking their friends, relative or husbands. suggestion.

373
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:42,890
institution interpretation in hospital, strengthen promotion of interpretation service, provided leaflets, notice, instruction with different language, provided interpretation service in clinic.

374
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,980
under health department.

375
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,730
should arrange female doctor off for the ideas.

376
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:54,920
Lady doctor important more than doctor others countries.

377
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,750
印度、巴基斯坦、尼泊爾。

378
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,370
馬來西亞。

379
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:10,360
Thailand，other thing，doctors，take to，already，government，will，take care，other，female，ladies，non-Chinese，people。

380
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,950
Thank you, sir.謝唔該。

381
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:33,240
誒，我嘗試簡單總結頭先發言嘅六個，我覺得我總結咗六個重點啦，即係細節啲我我冇諗到五個問題。咁希望官方答咗佢哋嗰啲問題先啊嘛。第一個重點咧，因為誒語言係一個好重要嘅問題，包括誒中文、廣東話，你寫嘅就中文、英文啦，講嘅就廣東話同英文。誒，大部分佢哋咧就中。

382
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:44,610
中文都困難，甚至係中英文都唔得。咁咧，而家究竟點樣可以做得到呢樣嘢咧？而家嘅培訓嗰度咧，亦都同樣牽牽涉到呢兩個語言嘅問題咧，令到佢哋做唔到嘅培訓嘅。

383
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:50,780
第二咧就係誒服務嘅部門咧，好多時如果前線咧係冇人去幫佢哋翻譯。

384
01:16:51,060 --> 01:17:11,070
畀佢想申請工啊、申請讀書啊、申請誒誒社會福利嘅政嘅嘢嘅時候咧，係冇人可以翻譯到畀佢哋聽得到，佢哋原來佢可以有呢一種嘅福利或者服務啊噉。咁第三咧就係就住政政府自己嘅職業嘅職業嘅政策上面咧，有冇一啲嘅誒製造啲職業專利？

385
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:31,080
畀呢一啲嘅係少數族裔嘅同嘅人士咧，咁特別政府自己嘅各部門有冇個比例規定一個比例，讓呢個比例嘅數目咧可以請一啲誒少數族嘅人士噉。咁因為頭先噉嘅情況之下，亦都做到佢哋因為工作上面揾困難，升學上面困難，誒甚至極少能夠升。

386
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:41,220
到大學咧，於是咧，佢哋能夠揾到啲好嘅工，有困難嘅時候咧，就好多係靠綜援。咁呢個又成為而家少數族裔嗰個問題。

387
01:17:41,500 --> 01:18:01,510
誒當然總嘅嚟講，一啲轉機構做緊嘅同工講咧，就係其實總嘅嚟講咧，頭先嗰啲係現象嚟嘅。最重要嘅本質咧就係冇一個共融嘅政策。如果共融政策咧，就算而家喺地區裏面有啲嘅政績做緊咧，誒部門之間又唔協調啦，誒啲做嘅計劃太短啦噉。

388
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:21,520
咁另外亦都有啲誒，我哋嘅誒同工講咧，即係社工講咧，就係而家有啲係新嘅一代咧，即係頭先嗰啲可能係比較年紀大嘅一代會面對啦。新嘅一代咧，就係唔單止要求頭先嗰啲所謂職業啊工作，係甚至要求社會參與。佢點能夠去參與社會裏面畀意見？你諮詢佢可以有畀。

389
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:41,530
意見佢去參與地區嘅工作，甚至參與咧係去參選成為議員，成為即係香港嘅一個部分。呢個都係因為頭先嗰啲情況咧，就係導致嘅困難。佢甚至問翻你而家委任制度裡面啊，有幾除咗評議會啊，評議會我估有啲被誒委任小組取嘅逐取啦，有幾多嘅依家嘅諮詢委員會？

390
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:45,260
有委任銷售組隊咧，如果數目幾多咧，佔個比例幾多咧？

391
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:46,270
唔該。

392
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,000
係邊位可以答？即係呢六個範圍。

393
01:18:52,490 --> 01:19:12,500
啊，主席或者就住培訓嗰度，我講一講再培訓局嗰個工作啊。噉就誒頭先聽到可能係關於嗰個誒語言嗰方面咧，係兩方面嘅。首先第一咧，再培訓局有一啲專設嘅語語文課程係教語文嘅。咁而誒入讀呢啲課程嘅少數族裔人士咧，亦都可以。

394
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,150
係得到民政事務總署提供嘅一個誒誒培訓津貼嘅。

395
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:37,440
而第二部分咧，就係關於其他嘅再培訓局嘅課程啦。咁誒，再培訓局咧，佢係有專設嘅課程，係以英文授課嘅。咁呢啲可以方便嗰啲係唔識中文而係識得英文嘅少數族裔人士，佢去報讀啊。另外咧，如果有一啲係誒誒，譬如嗰個少數族裔人士。

396
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,270
佢都係中英文都唔識啦。其實如果喺嗰個培訓機構，如果佢，

397
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:55,320
開嗰個誒培訓班嘅時候咧，都係譬如嗰啲小組熟聚人士係集中係另外一個語言嘅話咧，佢哋係可以邀請一啲翻譯咧，係幫佢哋喺課堂嗰度咧作出嗰個翻譯嘅。

398
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:15,610
咁誒，再培訓局亦都睇到少數族裔人士喺誒語言嗰個特點咧，佢哋其實喺一四一五年咧係有一個誒新嘅一個誒即係培訓嗰個項目嘅咧，就係誒教一啲誒遊輪嘅入門課程，希望咧就係可以培訓啲誒少數族裔人士咧，就喺遊輪上面服務。

399
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:35,620
咧咁遊輪上邊一般就係誒遊客啦，噉佢係講即係外國嘅語言嘅，咁呢個係希望可以利用到少數族裔人士嗰個語言嗰個優勢嘅。噉啊培訓方面，我講到呢個。O.K.，頭先另外其他啲題目有冇部門可以答？或者我講一講我哋誒翻譯嗰方面嘅服務啦。咁

400
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:55,630
一般嚟講咧，我哋集中心咧都係提供雙語嘅服務嘅，即係話咧，如果個求職者咧有需要咧，係無論中文英文，我哋都會提供個服務啦。咁但係至於有啲真係話中文英文都係有困難嘅咧，我哋係會利用誒融匯中心嗰個翻譯嗰嗰個促服務嘅嚇，即係話咧可以幫佢哋安。

401
01:20:55,630 --> 01:21:15,640
排，如果係可以用電話可以用電話嘅模式啦，亦都有需要嘅話，可以甚至請佢哋上嚟我哋中心嗰度做一個翻譯。咁至於我哋嘅大型嗰啲招嗰啲誒招聘會咧，我哋係特別咧係請咗非住員機構咧，就係駐場咧做翻譯嘅。譬如最近一次咧，我哋都請咗誒三個語言嘅嘅翻譯專家咧嚟幫我。

402
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:21,870
嚟做做翻譯，咁亦都係有利用到呢個服務咧，係等啲誒求職者咧同啲僱主咧係商議嘅。

403
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:23,370
Okay.

404
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:44,110
係，或者係，誒主席，我就就住民政事務總署個嘅工作範疇裏邊，儘量解答。咁首先我講一講翻咧，就係關於呢個翻譯嘅服務啦，嚇。誒，咁咧就其實喺誒翻譯服務方面咧，我哋係根據即係政制同埋內地事務局嘅出眾呢一個總。

405
01:21:44,110 --> 01:22:04,120
平等行政指引嘅原則咧，係誒相關部門咧係應該係各自佢哋喺自己政策範圍裏邊咧，係要為佢嘅服務嘅使用者咧係提供相關嘅即係傳譯嘅服務嘅。咁誒當然啦，佢哋有需要嘅話咧，其實係可以去透過即係現行嘅機制裏邊咧，同埋規例。

406
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:24,130
咧係去揾服務機構咧係提供相關服務嘅。舉例咧就係譬如話，醫醫管局嗰方面咧就已經係就住佢哋比較專業嘅醫療服務嗰方面咧係揾咗承辦商服務嘅承辦商咧係一個社企嚟嘅，係提供相關嘅服務嘅。咁至於民政處咧，我哋係委託咗呢一個嘅。

407
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:44,140
嘅香港基督教嘅服務處啦，係營辦呢一個嘅即係融會中心啦，係提供相關嘅服務畀誒一般嘅即係服務使用者。咁呢一個咧係輔助性質嘅。咁當然咧，我哋其實喺誒同誒服務中心裏邊咧，都係有個緊密嘅合作啦，係同誒向唔同嘅政府部。

408
01:22:44,140 --> 01:23:04,150
部門咧係介紹推介我哋嘅相關服務嘅，係鼓勵佢哋咧係多用嘅。咁喺呢一度，我哋都知道咧，就喺過去嗰三年咧，我哋服務嗰個嘅即係使用率咧係有上增加嘅。誒喺過去三年咧係已經由誒二千三百六十次裏邊咧就增加去到四千多次嘅。咁多。

409
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:24,160
當中咧，大部分咧係即係服務使用者，少數族裔主動係提供，即係或者係要求去提供服務嘅嚇。咁呢個係即係電話方面嘅傳譯啦嚇。咁另外咧就係有政府部門分別咧都係喺過去嗰三年咧係上升咗個用途嘅，係由過去嗰個四百六十次咧係增加到去八百七十次嘅。咁呢個係有完係。

410
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:44,170
係有進步嘅。當然，我哋覺得亦都要繼續係向更加多嘅部門去推介呢一方面嘅服務嘅嚇。咁呢度係噉。咁至於誒，另外其他啲同事唔知有冇嘅？主席有補充一下。係誒，其實今年嘅施政報告咧係為呢個少數族裔誒嘅輔助方面咧係推。

411
01:23:44,170 --> 01:24:04,180
出咗好多新嘅措施嘅，咁喺教育方面咧，就係誒會係全面全面支援少數族裔嘅學生學習中文啦。咁呢度我哋唔詳細講啦。咁但係至於喺就業方面咧，就重點咧就會喺兩方面咧，一方面就係會提高少數族人士喺公營同埋私營機構嘅就業嘅機會嘅。

412
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:24,400
咁如果喺政府職位方面咧，就誒亦都係有好多個措施，包括就話會推行一啲措施啦，就確保佢哋我哋啲少數嘅朋友咧喺投考政府職位嘅時候咧係享有平等嘅機會。咁呢啲措施係包括喺維持良好工作表現嘅要求嘅基礎上邊咧，檢討同埋修訂相關政

413
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:44,410
政府職位嘅中文能力、語文能力要求同埋招聘安排啦。咁另外，警員嘅招聘測試程序咧，亦都修改咗，係會要求投考人除咗以中文之外咧，係與英文技術模擬警務行動中嘅情況。咁投考人如果通曉外語或者係少數族裔嘅語言咧，係獲。

414
01:24:44,410 --> 01:25:04,420
給予咧額外嘅分數嘅，咁另外亦都會聘用少數族裔人士咧擔任警察社區聯絡助理，以加強同少數族裔人士嘅聯繫啦。咁而至今咧，十四個警區咧，亦都係共有十五個警察社區聯絡助理嘅職位咧，係係有㗎啦。咁

415
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:24,430
另外，懲教署嘅二級懲教助理嘅招聘安排咧，係經修改咧，係會以小組面試咧，係取代中文寫作嘅測試。噉，另外其他嘅機率機部隊同埋政府飛行服務隊啊、消防處啊，都會正在採取措施係改動中文語文能力要求同埋招聘安排嘅。

416
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,200
噉。

417
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:45,870
其實就誒私人機構方面咧，我哋勞工處都會積極係去揾一啲啱大家嘅工啦，係同埋正話提過咧，係舉辦呢個招聘會咧，係幫助大家就業。咁在訓局咧，亦都係會提供英文授課嘅課程啦。咁特別提一提咧，就係建造業議會咧，係會推行好多推廣嘅活動，同埋推。

418
01:25:45,870 --> 01:26:05,880
同埋聯同嗰啲業界咧，係舉辦招聘會，吸引銷售業嘅人士咧，係加入呢個建造業，同埋吸引咧在職嘅銷售業嘅建築工人咧，係參加培訓課程，提升佢嘅技術水平嘅。咁整體嚟講咧，政府係每年咧會額外係投入二億元咧，係推行一啲嘅措施，目的咧就希望。

419
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:25,890
藉住大家嘅共同努力咧，係令到大家咧嘅少數人士嘅朋友咧，可以發揮潛能，同埋可以真正噉樣融入嘅社會嘅。咁所以其實喺今年嚟講咧，其實多都好多措施，同埋個政策上咧，都係有好多嘅調整同埋呢個完善咗嘅。頭先提過嘅另外三方面，好似就一路大家集中。

420
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:43,220
講翻譯啊！誒誒請人可能有啲變整變化啦。咁有冇誒政府有冇政策係某個比例、某個比例嘅請少數族裔咧？第二有冇個融入嘅政策去全面地睇呢個問題咧？第三就係誒嗰個政治參與。

421
01:26:43,500 --> 01:27:03,510
誒個比例有冇委任啲人？呢呢三方面完全冇掂到，有冇可以講嘅？主席雖然就唔係我哋嘅工作範疇之內，不過我哋就盡量去解答好嘛。因為其實呢個都係誒牽涉整體政府嗰個嘅政策同埋嗰個做法嘅嚇。咁誒，其實咧喺誒，首先我都要講翻係政府係誒重視。

422
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:23,520
少數族裔對於我哋香港發展嘅貢獻嘅，亦都係肯定嘅嚇。咁少數族裔係土生種長喺香港都落地生根咗好多嘅好多代嚇。咁其實所以佢哋係香港嘅一份子，呢個係即係一個重要嘅信息嚟嘅。第一嚇，第二咧就係雖然我哋各自部門就根據我哋個各自嘅政策咧去提供服務啦。

423
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:43,530
嚇，咁喺誒政府高層裏邊咧，其實都係有個協調嘅工作嘅。咁誒，其實喺今年個施政報告裏邊咧，係有一個嘅小冊子，係專門係講呢個少數族裔嘅支援嘅服務嘅。咁裏邊涵蓋多方面，政府呢一年或者個誒或者係呢幾年裏邊嘅新嘅政策嚟嘅，裏。

424
01:27:43,530 --> 01:28:03,540
便涵蓋咗係教育啦、就業啦，同埋呢一個嘅社區嘅外展等等，亦都係政府嘅高層裏邊有個統籌協調嘅工作。咁所以咧係有一個嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅處理嘅噉樣。咁所以咧其實我就誒都係將頭先有關唔喺我哋嗰個嘅即係政策範疇裏邊嘅即係建議咧。

425
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:23,550
我哋未必可以即係可有一個好詳細嘅回答，咁但係我哋可以翻去或者將即係有關意見都反映翻畀相關嘅政策部門知道下。咁頭先我第二個即係代佢哋即係總結咗六個題目，都係其中有三個題目你哋完全冇掂到嘅。我睇下你可唔可以之後用書面畀我哋，還是我哋再追局長嚟開會傾頭先嗰三。

426
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:43,560
個問題融入政策，政府有冇個請少數族裔嘅比例嘅數字嘅政策？第三就係個政治參與。好，跟住我哋而家誒畀議員提問，好嘛？每人因為時間，我哋突半完啦。我當然陣間可以，如果需要嘅時候再延長啦。噉我每人四分鐘，好嘛？咁而家我隊咧就有李卓仁、梁美芬、張國柱、馮誒張超雄、馮檢基。

427
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,440
啊，李俊。

428
01:28:46,030 --> 01:29:06,040
誒，都係主席噉，我哋提出話要討論呢個就業問題咧。就其實因為你話貧窮，其實貧窮如果冇就業，一定係貧窮嚇。如果你即係大家係要融入，亦都一定有份工。咁如果你冇份工，你冇一個就業嘅機會，冇一個平等嘅機會嘅話咧，即係我覺得係誒，即係對。

429
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:26,050
誒少聚鋭去參與社會係有個好大好大嘅打擊。噉啊，首先好多謝大家誒上嚟呢度係發言，我哋都聽到大家聲音。嗯，咁頭先有朋友講就話，即係要有一個全面融入嘅政策，唔好頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳。噉我哋絕對同意。但係我而家最慘一樣嘢咧，覺得佢頭痛都～

430
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:28,250
啊！意頭都未做啊！

431
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:48,700
根本腳痛醫腳都未做嚇，所有啲嘢今日聽完政府講咧，其實都係冇做過誒任何嘢，除咗我唯一一樣嘢聽到新嘅啫，就係原來大家係可以去遊輪嗰度做嘢啫嚇。咁其他我都冇聽到有啲咩新嘅措施嚇，尤其就業嗰方面嚇啊，譬如。

432
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:53,150
譬如話，即係誒勞工處嗰方面咧，其實誒。

433
01:29:53,430 --> 01:30:07,900
你當然你話入到去噉，你梗係話自己乜都有噉，同埋你又話自己咧會叫啲僱主咧就係誒要有個平等機會，但係即係我完全覺得依啲去到實際運作嗰陣時係唔會出現嘅。

434
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:28,190
即係我意思就係你你你哋有幾可啊？即係個僱主打電話上嚟話登記話我要請人，你哋有幾可同佢講話啊？你又要求中文英文噉樣樣有幾可？你會去諗到底係邊份工啱少就最睿去做咧？即係你哋有冇個分析啊？不如咁問。

435
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:36,280
你有冇分析？就係而家整體嚟講，喺啲僱主去勞工處話要求請人。

436
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,260
你哋有冇個分析？

437
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:51,210
係其實誒基本上應該有啲咩功咧，係可以或者一個機會咧，係畀到少數罪人咧，有冇依類嘅分析咧？咁如果你冇依類分析嘅話，其實你冇個敏感度嘅。

438
01:30:51,700 --> 01:31:11,710
人哋想嚟話又要一個一邊話要揾你做，另一邊話要請人。你完全冇分析嘅話咧，你唔會特別係去同啲僱主講話。喂，其實你可以考慮請銷售做弱嘅喎。你如果你冇依一個嘅清單嘅嘅一個分析嘅話，嚇咁大家都知道嘅限制。如果佢中英文都好掂噉啊，唔使你。

439
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:31,720
而家搞添啦，係嘛？佢哋自己會搞，但係事實上係有一個好大嘅問題。呢個第一，即係呢個第一個問題嚇。但係我淨係講多一樣嘢咧，就係關於政府嗰度，我哋喺公務員事務委員會亦都傾過嚇。噉我覺得係好唔滿意政府一樣嘢，好多少少仲要同我哋講咧。九七之年去開考警察，九七之後考唔冇得考。

440
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,750
係咁簡單啫！如果你肯恢復翻九七之前，

441
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:52,410
嘅考警察嘅制度咧，我諗好多人都已經可以考到警察，但係佢始終佢哋唔肯恢復翻九七之前。咁九七之前嘅警察係咪好差咧？又唔係啊，即係大家都知道一樣嘅啫嚇。咁點解唔可以恢復翻九七之前咧？噉啊，多謝主席。係誒，邊位同事答？

442
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:56,410
係啊，兩睇。謝，多謝啊李李議員。

443
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:15,890
其實咧，我想解釋一下咧，我哋而家嘅就業市場咧，咁大家都知道咧，係相對咧係嘅空缺咧係比較多嘅，所以其實每一個月咧，我哋差唔多咧係收到咧係成十萬份工嘅，嚇，咁所以咧，其實工種就好多，同埋工作都好多。

444
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:36,250
咁所以調翻轉嚟講咧，而家我哋嘅做法咧就好少話逐個僱主同佢講你請唔請誒消逐人士咧，咁因為實在係太多工，同埋同埋啲工咧亦都有啲係適合啦，有啲係唔適合啦。咁所以調翻轉嚟講咧，我哋係需覺得係需要咧，反而睇翻個消逐人士嗰個會過嚟求職嗰啲人士嗰個能力係點樣樣，而幫佢。

445
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,080
配對嘅。

446
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:57,740
噉我哋就因誒，其實我哋都發覺咧，真係噉樣配對咧，可能嗰個嗰個誒做法咧，就未必好有效。咁所以咧，我哋最近咧，我哋係搞一啲大型嘅招聘會啦。咁喺嗰啲招聘會度咧，我哋特別同啲僱主傾，就希望咧佢哋係有心，即係話都會考慮有啲適合嘅職位啦，係請少數人士嘅。

447
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:17,750
我就畀一畀一個誒優先佢，就去可以參加呢個招聘會。咁可以睇一啲客觀嘅數字啦。咁呢個招聘會咧，我哋喺三月搞嘅，就啱搞完啦，喺五五號同六號搞嘅，喺呢個誒旺角啦。咁喺嗰一次嘅招聘會入邊咧，就我哋係可以誒，我哋因為都大肆宣傳啦，所以都有。

448
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:37,760
好多少數人士咧係知道就嚟參加噉就總數咧有成一百七十七十九位咧係嚟出席嘅。咁而入邊咧就誒安排到面試，即係直接同個僱主見面咧係有二百個人次啦。咁而獲聘咧就係有七十九位嘅。咁而最後咧，當然有啲佢哋反而係因為。

449
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:53,020
佢哋可能未必係啱佢哋嘅工作啦，所以接受即係真係有上工嘅咧。我後屘跟進咗咧，係有四十七位嘅。咁所以我哋覺得咧，依個模式咧可能係有效啲嘅，因為真係有份工咧可以吸引到佢哋嚟警察嗰度點啊？嚇，警察嗰度。

450
01:33:53,300 --> 01:34:01,480
警察嘅請人方法，警察就對唔住，因為就唔係我範疇，我就答唔到警察個只樣嘅方法。即係九七同二九七之後嗰分別。

451
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:21,790
答唔到啊！不過主席，我就喺依度咧，我覺得誒，即係變成誒，好似就覺得靠誒，即係招聘會咁啦。咁但係就即係佢哋都承認配對唔掂，但係我覺得如果你拿住十萬份工，你都唔做唔掂配對，你去一年你搞得次幾多個招聘會？

452
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:41,800
嗯，即係會唔會你哋喺配對嗰方面，其實你哋係有冇檢討過你哋運作模式，同埋你哋可能你最後咧，如果你哋就咁好，被動配對一定唔掂嘅。即係會唔會係真係一個深入嘅就業服務，然後真係逐個逐個傾，然後即係然後喺傾完之後，你真係喺個database嗰度嗰個供嘅資。

453
01:34:41,800 --> 01:35:01,810
資訊嘅裏邊咧，係揾到啲啱嘅工，同埋你今次有個招聘會，亦都可能有啲經驗咧，係有幫你哋配對。但係我我自己覺得成個勞工處係冇一個真正嘅配對服務嚟嘅，全部靠你哋自動波上去、自動波揾工、自動波去去去打電話去畀個僱主，而唔係一個真正嘅配對嚇。簡單，簡單。

454
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:21,820
我我諗其，我諗我唔係話配對冇用，而係話咧根本而家個模式咧，就有一啲我哋係希望係幫佢咧去主動去揾工，因為你唔可以下下即係話配對，因為一上網咧已經有咁多份工，其實反而佢哋係有要認識一個技巧，去邊度揾工，同埋係點樣樣去揾工，點樣去面試，咁所以事實上咧，我哋。

455
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:41,830
係幫佢咧，提供提供個服務咧，係個人嘅諮詢服務。佢哋上到嚟咧，我哋係會同佢傾偈，同佢講講講點樣個市場係點樣樣，揾工嘅渠道係點樣樣。佢自己譬如話佢想改善一啲求職技巧嘅話，我哋畀啲建議佢，或者可以甚至係啲模擬面試噉樣。然後之後咧，佢就會如果佢中意嘅話咧，佢可以要求配對。

456
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:55,680
佢亦都可以直接去嗰個網誒，我哋個網站或者係我哋嗰啲誒空缺搜尋終端機嗰度睇嗰啲工，因為而家我哋九成嘅工咧，啲僱主都係接受嗰啲人咧係直接申請嘅，根本就唔需要配對。O K.，阿梁美芬。

457
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:16,370
Welcome all of you to have come and share your feelings and opinions. It so happens I have a number of family friends and also the best friends of my husband and my sons are ethnic minority. Yesterday I had an Indian student coming to my home, sharing the.

458
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:36,380
the the homework the need to do a homework and last week my home entertained and also received a guest from Pakistan Pakistan so I I truly truly have that kind of feelings that our friends of ethnic minority they would like to be

459
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:54,250
part of Hong Kong and you love Hong Kong and you love a lot of our Chinese culture, Chinese medicine. You want to learn Chinese thing, Chinese food, and you want to have all your Chinese friend to be part of your family.

460
01:36:54,550 --> 01:37:09,040
所以，我的經驗是，那，當然，我兒子讀的學校做得很好。我覺得他們對少數族裔學生很友善。

461
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:18,220
And they actually have a particular class to let them mingle together with the local students, so they they can have good friends at school.

462
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,610
啊！

463
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:39,900
And in my working place, I'm working at the Law School of City University. We have very prominent professors who are also from India and from Sri Lanka, and we also have very very good working relationship. So, how to let this asset of Hong Kong

464
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:59,910
You are very precious actors, and and still stayed in my mind. Like few years ago, we have a Napoleon accidentally killed in Kowloon. I I visited Chung King Building many times. It was my district in Tsim Sha Tsui. Always chat with them about the what they need, and they share with.

465
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:19,920
Any questions? Yeah, no, no, no, no. I, I, I will have a remark at the end because I don't think they could answer it. Like even watching movies, you don't have a venue. That's what we heard. The tickets are very, very expensive. Like three times like Hong Kong movies. So I think they are.

466
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,530
Apart from just looking at the job issue.

467
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:43,820
如何 mingle together with the local culture is a very important issue in terms of the education area. You mentioned the political participation. This afternoon, I chatted with one of my colleague. We I would like to suggest that the future political reform proposal.

468
01:38:43,950 --> 01:39:03,960
to include some members representing ethnic minority. And actually, I discussed with a number of your groups in these two years. We would like to have that suggestion in the nominating committee. Of course, I know that our colleague from the opposition camp, they may not buy the idea of nominating.

469
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:17,440
Committee, but I personally think that that is a way, and also you should voice out and actually you can express this wish to the government.

470
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:37,730
That is one of the way that you can have your representative to speak, and also in the CE election in future, they need to come to your group to get your ideas about what you want about mingling with the society as well as education and job.

471
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:39,650
所以。

472
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:43,580
我唔知，你哋願唔願意。

473
01:39:43,860 --> 01:40:02,640
to be identified as ethnic minority. That, in fact, that's something I would like to ask you, because I have heard from some of my friends they don't want to be labelled as ethnic minority. They said we are Hong Kong people. So I would like to get some of your view. Any one of you.

474
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:07,030
Okay， and one， anyone want to answer？

475
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:10,310
maybe I we can have one. okay, thank you.

476
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,180
誒誒，我諗咧係。

477
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:27,220
每人中意係誒，即係嗌到佢南亞裔啊，或者係ethnic minority咯，係呢個事實嘅。噉，I don't actually I would like to speak in English。Yes, please.

478
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:47,900
I think we can see something like Labour Department. They talked a lot of things. I I personally and as a leader of the community in my area, I think they have no ever advertisement. I'm

479
01:40:47,900 --> 01:41:07,910
喺政府辦公室，或喺，where the people，minority people gathers，，they have no any any any notice or any advertisement pamphlet given to the minority people，so it can，because if you don't know there is some kind of service provided by labour department，how

480
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:09,450
可以，你 utilise it。

481
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,280
她可以有兩百萬個 job。

482
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:20,630
and she can, if she doesn't approach to the minority people, how can she match the job if the minor for the minority people?

483
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:40,950
That is the one thing. Number two, I think ethnic minority. My father has been living here in Hong Kong since 1969, and I am also living in Hong Kong for last 34 years. Yeah. And I speak fluent Chinese Cantonese. I be

484
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:54,080
in serving the Hong Kong, I mean as a good citizen, I have been doing my best, and if I am still considered as a second-class citizen,

485
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:14,490
I think it is not fair, because ethnic minority. What do you mean by ethnic minority? For example, I have a question. My children are born in Hong Kong, and they will grow up in Hong Kong. They can read and write Chinese. If you still call them ethnic minority people or South Asian.

486
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:34,750
Is it fair? Although they got permanent ID card, established status in the birth certificate, and they are still because I think this will not do any good for Hong Kong. As a government, it has the responsibility to deal with this matter very seriously. To get this.

487
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:54,760
這些 people encircle， and they they have the responsibility. Because if you are just treating them as a lower class citizen, they have no confidence. They can you cannot utilise their abilities in future. 哈，主席頭先李卓人都有七分鐘，我一定要講多少少，因為頭先潘永樂先生咧就。

488
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:12,950
一分鐘嘢加埋佢答埋，唔係，我唔使政府答，我唔使政府答。我想講咧，佢係批評咧，就話有一啲咧係建制派嘅誒團體，我唔知你講邊個啦，又滲透喺少數組內。我覺得咧，你呢種嘅態度，正正就同今日嘅會議係背道而馳。如果我哋係講緊harmony。

489
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:33,290
你睇啦，我哋一定要係完全有一個united front，佢即係我唔希望佢將呢啲嘢都政治化，我一定要表達呢啲意見清楚。每每一個人都可以有個睇法嘅，好嘛？啊，佢唔可以用滲透啊，你唔應該係用呢啲字，所以我一定要好清楚講畀潘生聽。我停止你啦，你過咗好多時間，我已經畀你問佢，等佢等佢答。正如啊李俊仁講嗰只，等佢答咁等。

490
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:42,360
但代表咧，我要停咧七分鐘已經太長。我要要求大家可以畀我用，我要用去到六點九啊，多十五分鐘。我哋仲有四位未問，阿張阿張學樹。

491
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,460
多謝主席。

492
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,370
即係，我都唔知點講好。

493
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:54,470
誒，我哋冇政策嚇，即係少數族裔即係融入嘅政策，我哋冇。

494
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,980
即係雖然剛才誒。

495
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:04,960
副助理處長講，即係有有張plan fact講，呢個都唔係一個政策。政策唔係淨係張plan fact。

496
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:16,300
誒，我我想問幾個問題啦。第一就係誒，我知而家好多Angel咧都做緊好多即係誒少數族裔嘅服務。

497
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:19,990
但係大絕大部分嘅錢唔係嚟自政府。

498
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:25,490
點解政府冇一個比較長遠啲嘅誒？

499
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,780
資助係擺落去。

500
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:44,570
啲社區中心或者其他嘅服務裏邊咧，係令到我哋嘅諮詢做嘅朋友咧，係完全可以攞到一啲融合嘅一啲服務。咁想問翻咧，就係勞福局嘅同事咧。

501
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:49,850
會唔會喺未來幾年咧？你係有啲比較長遠啲嘅？

502
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:53,440
即係計劃咧，係有錢擺落嚟，呢個第一。

503
01:44:54,220 --> 01:45:02,110
第二咧就係誒，我都同意咧。而家政府好好中意去睇個output。

504
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:07,830
係唔睇個outcome，即係你個效果好重要嘅。你唔好只應該睇啲數字。

505
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:16,280
會唔會你哋未來咧？如果有資源擺落嚟嘅時候咧，你係要睇個效果多過睇個數字。

506
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,660
第三樣嘢咧，就係誒。

507
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:26,340
剛才勞工誒處嘅同事提咧，就話個配對咧。

508
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:40,790
就誒困難好多嘅，亦都即係啊林祖明先生亦都提咗咧，就係你嗰個配對越嚟越即係個成功率越嚟越低啦。點解咧？你有冇去研究過個原因咧？

509
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,840
最後一樣咧，就係誒。

510
01:45:44,920 --> 01:46:04,930
我哋想著多啲認識少數族裔嘅情況咧，好可能我哋都要有一啲研究，知道下而家呢四廿幾萬嘅朋友，其實佢哋嗰個程度啊、專業嘅狀況啊，我哋可唔可以掌握下咧？誒，剛才社聯嘅同事都講咗。

511
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:16,320
就係話誒，佢哋喺個即係誒貧窮線下邊嘅數字都多嘅，咁呢個係一種嘅觀察，但係整體嘅少數族裔。

512
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:33,300
嘅朋友嗰個狀況係點？會唔會政府係有一個比較大即係誒誒大啲嘅研究咧？等我哋可以知多啲個情況，我哋就諗啲方法咧，係令到佢可以即係融合。多謝主席。O K，誒，唔該啱。

513
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:53,610
啊，傅傅女士，係誒主席，關於呢一個嘅誒長遠資助嗰個問題啦嚇，就住我哋民政事務總署誒所委託嗰誒六間嘅誒非政府機構啦嚇，咁雖然我哋嗰個嘅誒所謂嘅誒誒服務嘅合約係以兩年為個。

514
01:46:53,610 --> 01:47:13,620
期啊，咁但係其實事實上咧，我哋係每一年檢視咗之後咧，都係按個需要咧係有誒呢一個嘅即係增加同埋係延期嘅噉樣。咁當然啦，誒延期幾多次嚇點樣係誒會唔會係有一個比較長遠啲嘅做法？咁呢個我哋可以去諗嘅。

515
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:33,630
因為我哋都明白，如果要同即係少數誒族裔嘅人士咧，或者係朋友咧，係去提供服務畀佢哋咧，係要攞到佢哋嘅信任嘅嚇。佢信任咗你之後咧，即係好多嘅問題都可以交託畀你去即係幫佢噉樣。咁所以我哋喺呢一度咧，就喺誒現行我哋係誒兩年。

516
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:53,640
嘅誒，即係一期嘅合約嘅期限上邊，會唔會可以做一啲即係誒適當嘅即係做法嚇，令至嗰個嘅規劃可以比較長遠啲咧？咁呢個我哋可以翻去諗咁噉，但係要誒，因為個最初個誒去畀呢個合約出去嘅時候咧，係透過一個公開、透明、公平嘅程。

517
01:47:53,640 --> 01:48:13,650
程序嘅咁誒，唔同嘅機構去去誒，即係去bit呢一個噉樣嘅即係服務合約嘅時候，係當年有一個噉樣嘅即係誒理解嘅噉。所以如果任何有改變嘅時候咧，我哋都要都要有個考慮喺度。咁但係即係長遠嚟講咧，就我哋會係將嗰個嘅比較中長期嘅諗法咧，會係。

518
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:15,570
即係釋放一個處理噉樣。

519
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:36,110
勞工處會講講個配對做法有冇點可以改善咧？或者我再，或者我首先講講誒關於嗰啲我哋準唔準握到嗰啲誒少數人士嗰個資料啦。咁其實誒香港政府統計處咧喺二零一一年咧就係人口普查有個主題性報告咧，就係講少數族裔人士嘅。

520
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:56,620
咁呢個普查入邊咧，都包括咗好多有關嘅數據，即係話喺香港嘅少數族裔人士嗰個情況係點啦。噉就誒，譬如話咧，佢入邊嘅資料咧，我係得知到咧，扣除咗外接家用家庭用工之後咧，其實少數族裔人士嘅參人口參與率咧。

521
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,640
誒，嗰個即。

522
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:20,210
勞工參與率咧係百分之六十五點二嘅，係比整體嘅參與率咧五啊七點九咧仲要高一啲嘅。咁另外佢都提咗好提供咗好多有關嘅數據，譬如話佢經濟活動身份啊，或者從事嘅職業啊、行業啊、收入啊、工作地點。咁所以咧，根據呢啲資料咧，我哋都畀到好多畀到好多資。

523
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:28,440
盡我哋知道咧喺香港咧誒，蘇俊逐個嘅朋友咧嗰個情況嘅，同埋佢哋嗰個求職嗰個需要嘅。

524
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:49,030
咁另外咧就誒正話提過咧，關於我哋嗰個轉介服務啦。噉我都曾經即係之前都解釋一個下，就係話咧，其實而家咧我哋啲工作咧好多都係唔需要轉介嘅，要轉介嘅咧其實係有啲僱主可能係特別需要轉介，又或者咧個銷嗰個銷售嘅求職者咧，佢自己希望有特別嘅。

525
01:49:49,030 --> 01:50:09,040
係一個轉介，即係話揾幫佢揾個僱主，所以所以雖然話個數係比較偏低啦嚇，咁但係事實上咧有好多咧係直接自己去揾工咧，而我哋係唔知道即係嗰個成果嘅，可能係揾到工咧，但係冇需要呈報畀我哋聽。咁但係我哋都好希望瞭解個情況咧。咁於是乎咧，我哋喺二零一三年一嘅。

526
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:14,860
嘅第二季開始咧，就做咗一啲嘅調查嘅。咁喺第三個誒。

527
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:27,860
喺第三季，喺第二季開始咧，即係做咗三季嘅。咁咧就全數咧有五百四十五位登記嘅人士啦。噉我哋就話其中揾到咧係即係成功訪問到咧係三百四十八位嘅。

528
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:31,360
噉啊，得知咧，其實咧有一半嘅誒。

529
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:49,830
嘅人士咧係已經揾到工嘅嚇，就其中其他一半咧就係揾緊工，咁而一一半咧我哋就請佢哋咧係上嚟接受我哋嗰個個人嘅諮詢服務，希望咧透過呢個服務咧可以加強佢哋求職嘅技巧啦，或者係幫佢哋揾工啊噉樣。O.K.張志紅。

530
01:50:52,150 --> 01:51:09,570
喂，係多謝主席。誒，少數族裔喺香港其實都係一個誒多元化嘅羣體嚟嘅。即係除咗本身唔同嘅族裔之外咧，我哋都講緊誒，譬如外傭啦、誒一啲外勞啦、難民啦。

531
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:22,940
咁誒，南亞裔誒，相對於其他一啲即係種族嘅少數族嘅族裔嘅人士，都都有好唔同嘅需要，有好唔同嘅情況。

532
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:26,500
噉我諗，我哋今日就集中講翻。

533
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:33,420
誒可能南亞裔嘅即係香港嘅永久居民。

534
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:47,580
佢哋面對嗰個貧窮嘅問題，即係最近呢個扶貧委員會發表嘅報告都顯示，嗰個貧窮情況係一般比誒，即係我哋香港嘅整體嘅貧窮都嚴重。

535
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:49,940
噉我諗呢個係無可置疑。

536
01:51:50,220 --> 01:52:10,230
誒就業令到佢哋可以脱貧呢個誒教育，令到佢哋可以喺事業嘅階梯度有進升，以致脱貧呢啲啲，我諗都係共識嚟。咁好可惜，即係喺教育度，我哋真係搞咗大輪。咁今日又唔集中喺教育啦。噉就住就業，政府就話佢哋都。

537
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:19,370
誒好願意去幫手，無論喺即係個就業配對，或者係政府自己公務員請咧，都會盡量即係做多啲。

538
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,370
不過喺嗰個數字上咧，又唔能夠提供得到。

539
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:29,860
即係我哋連究竟政府而家嘅公務員系統裏邊加埋N N C S C，即係誒。

540
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:40,770
合約非公務員究竟有幾多係屬於少數族裔咧？我哋都唔清楚。咁政府又似乎話誒冇呢個數字，又唔會跟得到噉樣。

541
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:48,120
咁如果跟唔到嘅話咧，其實我哋就好難去檢視究竟政府係咪即係得個港字。

542
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:57,250
咁所以我都想問下政府咧，第一你會唔會即係就住呢方面係要喺個系統度跟翻呢啲數字？

543
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:09,440
誒，以致到可以我哋睇翻咧個公務員系統裏邊，最低限度政府係咪真係帶頭去聘用多啲嘅少數族裔嘅人士？嗯嗯。另外咧就。

544
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:29,730
誒少數族裔人士去攞公共服務係好多困難，即係語言嘅障礙係一個重重要嘅困難。噉我睇到咧誒麥理遜語言中心咧，佢哋都提到其實而而其實而家政府部門咧去用呢一個翻譯服務咧，都係相當。

545
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:41,050
不足嘅，噉我都想誒物理護理中心就講講即係嗰個情況，因為佢哋都有份幫手咧，成立嗰個翻譯服務。

546
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:52,600
咁呢一點，如果嗰個公共服務，即係尤其是佢哋提到裏邊有啲誒部門啦，譬如話誒呢個勞工處啦。

547
01:53:52,930 --> 01:54:09,030
民政事務處啦，同埋房屋處咁嗱，勞工處同民政事務處今日都有人喺度啦，即係佢哋使用呢個傳譯服務都不足嘅，咁即係究竟個情況係點樣咧？噉我想誒啊～

548
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:18,420
不如用漁師會麥理遜中心講講啦，同埋政府都答翻我嘅問題。O K，噉我畀政府講先啊嘛，都要精簡啊嘛。如果重複嘅就唔使講。

549
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:40,020
我講咗翻譯服務先啦。誒頭先就其實就已經講咗好多㗎啦嚇。咁所有精簡講啲咧就係話誒，第一就係各自嘅部門咧，係要按佢嗰個政策範疇咧，係根據呢個誒誒行政指引咧，係要提供嗰個相關嘅誒服務啦。翻譯服務喺裏邊少數族裔可以獲得嗰個嘅公共嘅。

550
01:54:40,020 --> 01:55:00,030
誒就係服務嘅，咁呢個第一啦。第二咧就係話過去嗰三年咧，我哋誒喺誒我哋嘅融匯中心咧就都有誒服務嘅嘅上升嚇。喺誒過去裏邊咧都已經係上升咗差唔多係一半嘅，即係如果係講緊或者一倍嚇。如果係講緊即係政府部門嘅服務，咁當然我哋會係進。

551
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:07,550
係繼續努力啊！希望可以去做更多多嘅推廣，讓更多多嘅部門咧可以用到我哋嘅服務嘅多謝主席。

552
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:28,610
係誒麥道夫人中心啊，陳生精簡啲講講啊嘛。係，我想補充一句咧，就誒兩個情況嘅頭先講勞工處啊，或者係房署嗰邊咧。阿阿頭先阿傅小姐講嗰係真嘅，即係的確增加咗一倍嘅，但係個基數都仲係好少嘅。誒，舉個實際情況畀大家聽啦。我哋麥道夫人中心做緊嘅香港翻譯通報。

553
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:35,270
服務咧，醫管局咧，我哋就每年平均做四千幾至五千個翻譯個案嘅。

554
01:55:35,550 --> 01:55:39,060
咁但係其他整個部門合埋嗰個數咧？

555
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,810
都只係每年五百個左右。

556
01:55:42,270 --> 01:56:02,280
嗱，噉你就可以開開啲明佢講乜啦。咁即係話咧，你除翻出每個部門究竟幾多個都數得出嘅，雖然個比例升高好似好高。嗱，我睇法好簡單啫，就係而家出現嘅問題咧，係雖然有行政指引都好，第一前線比如勞工處嘅同事或者房署嘅同事，由於佢哋根本冇任何那麼樣嘅，唔好話同工添啊，甚至一啲大事件都。

557
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:02,970
冇咧。

558
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:23,260
噉樣前線同工好多時去評核啲使用者係咪需要翻去服務嘅時候咧，就出現咗一個落差㗎。噉我哋嘅街坊其實都好多表達到啲問題，佢有勞工需要，但係去到勞工處嘅時候咧，發覺都唔知問邊個好，有冇人會特別去主動同佢講係可以request一個所謂翻去服務，所以佢哋就冇咁做到咯。咁所以我覺得呢個政管清廉嘅方法係雖然有處。

559
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:37,190
centre提供翻嘅服務，但係前年同事少用㗎，咁點用到咧？我反而覺得可以做一個基本方法，就係話根本係勞工署好、房屋署好，都學似其他部門噉樣開始有啲叫做大視覺。其實頭先係都好，警務署咪有咯。

560
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:57,480
但勞工處冇㗎，房署都冇噉。其實可唔可以有啲計劃嘅話，有啲南亞嘅嘅人，無論佢係公唔公務員都好，有啲前線同事喺度嘅話咧，就好自然就會顧及到啲交通總呢個服務咯。O K，誒，到我，到我，主席可唔可以簡單跟進一句？就係一句咧，就係你可唔可以咧喺呢啲嘅誒部門度咧？把

561
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:04,920
擺一個標示出嚟，就話如有需要咧，可以尋求傳譯服務。

562
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:08,460
可唔可以噉樣樣？即係可以要求呢個全日服務。

563
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:28,940
擺呢個故事，或者我講一講。其實咧，我哋真係好希望可以使用到呢個服務。不過就我同啲同事都瞭解過呢個問題，佢就話咧好多時嗰啲少數人士上嚟揾工咧，好多時佢都識講嘅嚇，而都有啲係唔識講嘅咧，佢又會帶個親戚朋友上嚟幫手嘅，因為佢佢哋可能都。

564
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:48,950
好希望真係揾到份工啦。噉啊，有時都即係你哋嘅經驗咧，就冇呢個問題。咁唔係，所以我就話咧，其實暫時咧，所以我哋弱使用率係比較低咧，就有呢啲原因，因為本身佢都有啲朋友可以幫到佢。咁但係咧，我哋其實我我覺得咧，可以提醒我啲同事咧，儘量多啲利用呢一個服務咯。至於你話標示嗰啲，我哋冇問題嘅，即係可以。我哋其實而家都好多。

565
01:57:48,950 --> 01:58:08,960
有有標示，有我哋有我哋今日有個專門嘅櫃位咧，係服服務佢哋嘅。佢一上到嚟咧，我哋都可以即刻就幫佢安排好多嘅嘢㗎啦。OK，到我到我問啦。誒，我畀個經誒經驗你先，我先講我啲問題。就誒，蘇屋村重建咧，就其實蘇屋村裏面住咗啲南亞裔嘅人士，佢哋因為唔識睇中文，甚至揸住張圖都～

566
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:28,200
唔知咩其實，佢哋有啲人走嚟我投訴咧，佢哋係錯過咗係第一次揀屋嘅機會，而出資我買一處呢樣嘢，又同房屋處傾，我房屋處你知唔知你而家歧視緊少數族裔，因為佢哋唔識睇中文，你你冇英文嘅文件畀佢睇到咧，佢完全係唔知道原來一個客誒資金限期去去向你申請。

567
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:48,960
嘈完輪之後，之後咧房屋署先畀翻一個機會嗰個誒少族造裔嘅家庭，同埋咧之後咧就有英文嘅文件。但呢個英文文件即係蘇屋村啫喎，因為蘇屋村投訴咧，蘇屋村有第二個村咧，而家去去到石健尾就做重建啦，即係白田做重建啦，白田又冇啦，又淨係得翻中文。所以呢個情況就係你邊度嘈佢。

568
01:58:48,960 --> 01:59:08,970
佢佢就喺邊度有邊度唔嘈，佢佢就即刻就即刻翻翻轉頭。即係我覺得啲部門即係要諗清楚，緊自己做緊乜啊？大佬真係，即係你要要要要，即係已經已經畀人畀畀議員嘈你啦，已經有咗一次嘅經驗啊。同一個部門都可以第二個村就即刻就唔做啦。唔該你諗誒諗處理下呢樣嘢。我今日其實唔係。

569
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:18,300
自己開心㗎，即係雖然做到主席誒，大家啊啊人誒睇嗰個題目，因為三位都係部門嘅職員，係冇政策嘅職員。

570
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:22,430
而我哋扶貧委，我哋扶貧小組係針對扶貧委員會嘅。

571
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:42,720
扶貧委員會本身而家咧已經成立咗個小組咧，係處理呢個小組族裔嘅問題。噉我覺得扶貧扶貧委員會唔應該傾誒你幾多錢啊？誒你個翻譯掂唔掂啊？你要點樣樣？我覺得扶貧委員會傾緊應該係政策性嘅嘢，即係究竟點樣處理而家小組族裔嘅人士香港嘅問題咧噉。

572
01:59:42,720 --> 02:00:02,730
咁當然能夠做到係，我將來都唔用‘小組做序’呢個字㗎啦。噉啊，當然呢個係最好嘅，我同意嘅。但係喺而家你唔處理嘅話，你唔有特別嘅政策處理呢個問題嘅話咧，小組續序只係會更加畀人喺下面啊，都上唔到上嚟。開始呢個開始嘅時間係需要有政策，讓我哋嘅小組續序按呢啲政策喺嗰個。

573
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:10,620
社會梯階向上爬，向上向上升。咁所以，我覺得而家我哋諗緊講緊呢樣嘢，頭先三個好重要嘅。

574
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:14,090
嘅問題咧，係完全你哋唔處理，其實。

575
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:34,380
佢哋提得係非常之重要。唔該，你寫低可唔可以？我就要求扶貧委員會嗰個小數族裔研究組咧，係要跟呢三個問題同埋將來畀翻答案我哋。一個就係政府要唔要有，會唔會有政策去有一個比例請小數族裔人士？呢個都唔係淨係講警察添，我覺得係任何嘅政府。

576
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:36,270
部門都應該有個比例，譬如。

577
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:42,040
你按翻小組做嘢嘅比例咯，一小組做嘢大概係五個percent，我咪六個percent，咁咪咪五六個percent啦噉。

578
02:00:42,340 --> 02:01:02,350
咁第二咧就係嗰個讀書嘅問題啊。雖然呢今日唔係講升學，但係升學係影響就業。而家嗰個大學嘅少數族裔入大學嘅入學率咧，同我哋普通香港人嘅入學率咧，係爭係香港人嘅四成嘅嘢，即係佢少六成嘅。即係如果按比例，佢應該有同我哋佢嘅人數幾多，即係佢四十萬噉嘅。

579
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:22,360
幾多人入大學？同我哋整體全香港七百萬幾多香港非小數族人入大學個比例成正比先啱㗎嘛？咁點解佢得四成咧？咁呢個係咪又要處理下？係咪我哋嘅考試制度嘅問題？我呢個其實我當我哋當年我評機會時候已經提過好多次。而家個考試制度係對佢哋唔公平㗎嘛？因為要要考中文講係容易㗎，好多嘅我其實。

580
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:42,370
我我我自己嘅區裏面好多嘅村咧，係好多小朋友講啲廣東話仲叻過我哋香港人嘅小朋友。但係叫佢寫啊，叫佢睇咧，就係好大困難。咁呢個係咪真係有啲教育制度上面真係要用用小學做入口，另外一啲嘅中文科唔係跟嚟嗰科。如果你佢升唔到小學，升唔到中學，中學升唔到大學，就當然呢個小學升唔到中學嘅。而家十十。

581
02:01:42,370 --> 02:02:02,380
十五年嘅教育啊！即係中學升唔到大學嘅時候，根本就唔會揾到份同我哋香港人平等嘅工作。咁呢個咪你又要處理啦噉。第三個真係真係諗個整整體嘅融融融合計劃啊！即係你冇個融合嘅計劃政策嘅話咧，你永遠唔會重視。即係我哋香港有四十萬，係呢個唔人數唔少嘅四十萬人咧，係點樣去？

582
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:17,430
將自己，你要令到香港人當佢係香港人，亦都要令到佢哋自己係當自己係香港人，噉你先至能夠係一家人嘅。如果你做唔到呢樣嘢，做做唔到，而呢方面即係各方面嘅政策都要配合先得嘅。

583
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:31,060
我我唔知，我就希望係將頭先我講嗰啲嘢咧，就今日我知道三個部門嘅官員咧都未必答得到，但係我哋今日其實我哋今日嘅針對對口部門係應該扶貧委員會，但我就好好失望就係扶貧委員會係冇人嚟。

584
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:40,070
噉我唔知誒，如果答到就答，答唔到可唔可以幫我將呢啲轉述畀佢哋個委員會聽？當佢哋委員會有啲決定之前咧。

585
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:42,250
可唔可以再翻嚟我呢度傾？

586
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:44,470
有冇邊位可以？

587
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:52,450
簡單答我啦先。其實我最後個問題就係最後嗰度，當然前提嗰啲嘢就係我哋覺得對小學做而家最比較重視嘅問題。

588
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:55,100
有冇人答到啊？

589
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,980
有冇可以轉述啊？

590
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,140
啲扶貧基金咪冇人嚟。

591
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:04,060
都唔得，噉我更加失望添。

592
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:23,960
即係今日我哋講嘅最重要嘅嘢係冇人可以幫我哋話畀，或者就誒，我哋就去轉述嗰個嘅意見啦。等我哋考慮好嘛？係即係，因為扶貧委員會已經有個噉嘅組咧。你你你個組今日冇你又唔應該，即係冇你又唔派人嚟聽我哋今日講咁多知道做嘢團體喺度講嘢。

593
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:28,290
O.K.我講完啦，我冇冇，其實無話好説，誒，梁國雄。

594
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:29,500
主席。

595
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:33,720
即係呢個政，呢個新一屆嘅政府咧，就係。

596
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:37,990
即係開多啲牙門咧，就當解決咗咗個問題。

597
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:42,450
即係如果用英文講咧，就commitment instead of commitment。

598
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:54,540
兩個喺度爭議，因為仲有一個人跟名。係啦，咁個committee referral commitment，即係咧就係你你話要做A嘢，咁咪整個A committee。

599
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:59,640
噉就最少止咳咧，就止到止三年先啦，或者用先導計劃。

600
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,020
咁嗱。

601
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:02,640
誒。

602
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:07,930
南亞裔嘅誒香港人咧，就係擺咗喺度嘅問題嚟㗎啦。

603
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:10,260
好多都係香港人嚟嘅。

604
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:11,670
係咪？

605
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:13,020
噉你？

606
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:19,350
唔好叫你照顧其他人啦，難民嗰度搞到好難啦，即係誒，正即係嗰個。

607
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:26,140
誒政即係嗰個誒政治避難嗰啲，咁因為有個問題就係。

608
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,910
嗰間叫做國際社會服務社咧。

609
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:32,990
就係根本係一個嗰啲叫做。

610
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:42,640
collusion即係咩？叫做誒羣帶關係嘅產品嚟。噉啊個ISS呢個物體咧。

611
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,770
梁振英個老婆又係。

612
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,920
即係嗰個。

613
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:53,030
裏邊嘅其中一個啊啊啊贊助人。

614
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,830
呢個噉嘅，譚耀宗又係。

615
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:03,940
就搞到呢一塌糊塗，人哋日日上街，我陪咗佢十次都都解決唔到個問題。嗱，依個問題在於咩咧，主席？

616
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:08,370
就係你講得啱啦，扶貧委員會。

617
02:05:08,650 --> 02:05:22,940
就係要嚟應付我哋㗎嘛？你叫佢扶貧，咪整個扶貧委員會咯？係咪？我哋又跟，我哋最慘就我哋跟住佢啊！我哋又整個噉嘅嘢應付佢，畀足面啦！你而家你派三個都唔係扶貧委員會嘅人嚟。

618
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:32,860
噉我哋，你即係我覺得你係強人所難咯。佢嚟嗰個就就唔係話代表附牌。我請問三位官員，你係咪代表附牌委員會嚟㗎？

619
02:05:33,140 --> 02:05:40,810
係咪啊？應該唔係，唔係啊！確認咗啦，係咪？咁即係佢冇責任反映畀財委員會聽啦，佢應該反映畀政府聽啦。

620
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:44,570
如果真係有分工嘅話，咁有乜理由？

621
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,500
係做到嘢咧！

622
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:57,750
係咪啊？即使係一個最叻嘅人轉述都唔見咗一成㗎啦，咁轉述多兩次唔見得三成啦，咁即係話今日最多轉述到七成啦。

623
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,410
係咪啊？打咗折扣啦！

624
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:02,900
咁嗱，好簡單。

625
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:06,490
我哋而家就陪佢疲於奔命嚟開會。

626
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:22,960
原本政府應該做嘅嘢，佢就唔做，就變咗個扶貧委員會做。咁個扶貧委員會嚟同我對口嘅時候，扶貧委員會又唔做，就徵翻政府嚟做。其實就係將公務員呢一個隊伍咧嚟應付議會嘅監察，就唔係。

627
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:34,610
嗰啲問責官員同埋特首等等人等嚟問責，個關鍵就係咁啦。兜咗圈個圈之後咧，就變咗你永冇冇辦法同佢問責。

628
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:43,720
嗱，我不如我我講翻個問題啦。第一就係話，你哋講咧就係誒根據普查咧，就南亞裔嘅人口咧個就業率都唔錯嘅。

629
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:50,920
我想問你個貧窮率咧，即係話人哋勤力做嘢啦，但係佢窮過香港人，咁點搞咧？

630
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:54,540
我度我賭個人頭，佢嘅貧窮咧，就高過香港人。

631
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:57,140
第二就係。

632
02:06:57,460 --> 02:07:01,460
教學語即係嗰個語言嘅問題，你有咩難度咧？

633
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:05,190
人啲話畀你聽啦，你叫我學中文。

634
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:12,630
一係就學一種特別啲嘅中文，我難學啊嘛！一係就你嗰個誒喺聘請。

635
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:14,650
人嘅時候，你將。

636
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:25,390
一即係南亞藥去嘅時候，個中文個嗰個要求冇咁多。嗱，呢啲係實實事求是嘅，係對症而下藥嘅。咁又冇。

637
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:31,550
咁點搞咧？即係呢啲，即係呢個直遠上政策嚟嘅。

638
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:33,510
咁點解咧？

639
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:39,300
噉我我問你啦，我而家同你講啊，呢三位官員，你唔好同我。

640
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:48,390
傳達啲口信畀呢個扶貧委員會，費曬你哋嘅時間，我就係掟佢得㗎啦。佢就嚟你㗎啦，邊邊個扶貧委邊位邊個嚟㗎就係。

641
02:07:48,740 --> 02:08:02,060
扶貧委員會係啊，你知唔知啊？主席，你同佢對口我冇參加個小組，所以唔知邊個做主席。你唔知佢係咪咩人嚟啊？唔知邊個做主席，佢個小組成立嘅小組。係啦，噉我覺得你如果噉，你唔係掟佢，有咩辦法咧？

642
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:11,800
但係最後負責都係林鄭月娥一個委員會主席。哦，咁唔怪得佢咁關心掟嘢嘅問題啦。原來佢知道有一日畀人掟嘅有機會，因為佢唔負責任。

643
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:23,500
誒，好唔好？因為時間嘅問題，我我想大家容許我再言，因為有位誒團體都想發言，我畀畀多我五分鐘啊！我我唔講啊！畀多我五分鐘講嚟都嘥時間。誒，官員有冇回應？

644
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:34,690
唔使回應啊，嘥時間。你唔要佢回應，梗係唔使啦。Committee Ref. Okay，我想問一問誒在座嘅團體有冇邊一位再想講多一次？

645
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:43,760
好冇？我每人畀多一分鐘好嘛？三四位，四位好嘛？每人一分鐘。噉我延到十分，延多十分鐘。唔好意思，總係十分鐘，去到六點五十。

646
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:56,600
誒五個啊，五個，每人一分鐘，好嘛？因為我哋過曬時間啦，冇事，我等啲備選咗去啦，大家認錯。嗱，我按翻個原有嘅次序請你哋發言啦，好嘛？啊，李家樹先生。

647
02:08:57,690 --> 02:09:02,800
頭先提到嗰個建造業嗰個誒課程問題，其實係誒。

648
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:05,300
係脱離現實嘅。

649
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:25,590
因為我哋有好多南馬約嘅朋友咧，佢係因為而家建造業議會嘅課程，以前咧就會多少少英文嘅一啲誒嘅課程，依家係剩翻一個。噉佢哋有啲人咧想考嘅時候咧，其實佢同我哋講：喂，我考我要估佢個實務是做乜嘢？我要考兩三次，我先考到個牌。即係因為個。

650
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:45,600
因為佢嘅語言係中文，教嘅嘢係用中文，用廣東話。噉我而家想問下，係咪誒，即係見在誒議會係咪可以誒開放翻一啲課程，做一啲至少有英文咧，就唔需要話夾到咁多個人先至有一個英文嘅課程咧？因為冇乜可能你可以夾，除咗十幾個家庭，手停口停，可以同你。

651
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:54,580
讀呢樣嘢嘅冇可能嘅，佢貧窮率都好高。頭先啊，長毛講得好啱，佢貧窮率係達就職貧窮率，我哋研究過係達到六成以上嘅。

652
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:56,750
OK，啊，羅林先。

653
02:09:57,030 --> 02:10:17,040
係，我都想回應翻頭先張超。問到關於翻譯嘅係唔該，主席係咁關於翻譯服務嗰度，咁咧其實咧睇翻個數字咧，立法會喺誒二零一三年十一月嘅時候都提提問提出呢個問題嘅。咁其實睇翻咧嗰個誒電話傳譯服務咧，其實每年誒二零一二至二零一三年嘅數字咧，有誒三千幾個喺電。

654
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:37,050
馬翻譯嘅噉，但係實質上咧當中誒政府所使用嘅嘅次數咧，只不過係三百幾。即係換言之咧，政府所使用嘅數字咧其嘅使用呢個翻譯誒嘅傳有電話傳譯服務咧，只不過係佔咗十分之一嘅啫。咁另外咧，我哋都想誒係使用率係偏低嘅。咁如果按照翻。

655
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:57,060
真係，其實頭先講嗰個誒比例咧，其實職場傳譯咧係需要有double of嗰個電話傳譯嘅話咧。如果係三千幾個誒嘅嘅電話傳譯嘅話，我哋講緊係需要有個職場傳譯係講緊要有七千個㗎。而睇翻現有嘅數字，點解職場傳譯只係得五百幾個咧？係主要係因為咧，因為職場

656
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:17,070
全譯咧，只可以由政府要求提供嘅啫。咁好似誒，邊個做一個機keeper咧？唔係少數作用，我要提供，我要我唔明白，我要提供翻譯，而係嗰個職員去評估佢需唔需要提供翻譯。呢個係係好有問題嘅做法嚟嘅。即係無論佢去睇醫生或者係去去揾工，勞工處嗰個職員嗰個頭先講話誒，頭先嗰度講話職員，我覺得。

657
02:11:17,070 --> 02:11:28,050
唔需要嘅話，噉就冇提供呢啲翻譯畀佢哋。另外咧收費亦都係一個問題，佢哋係應該可以有權去使用呢個public service，又唔應該需要付款先可以攞到全譯服務。唔該。Okay，Mr.Taylor。

658
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:49,250
Hello, I just want to respond on the humanitarian assistance for protection claimants. There's been a fair amount of criticism, and you could look at whether policy or implementation. I think that it's understood that there are clearly areas of improvement in terms of budgeting, accountability, adaptive.

659
02:11:49,250 --> 02:12:09,260
criteria to determine the assistance rates. Actually, the contract for the next service package period will begin this year, and I hope that the government will take into consideration many recommendations, solutions-focused recommendations that the Refugee Concern Network made, of which Justice Centre Hong Kong.

660
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:29,270
作為成員，我認為問題在於我們需要看得更深一些，這就是為什麼我想要聚焦於這個許可工作。這對保護聲請人是公平的，但這也會減少許多我們現在看到的協助方案中的問題。這可能會

661
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:49,280
Allow these people to benefit the economy to be part of the tax base, and I think that's something we should consider. Okay, thank you, Ms. Sarah. Ah, yes. In view of such a low employment rate, we requested Labour Department before to make a special division for EM, but that time they rejected us. They said that.

662
02:12:49,280 --> 02:13:09,290
他們不認為需要設立專門的EM部門，為EM提供就業匹配服務，這樣他們就不會在申請勞動部時遇到困難。問題是，如果勞動部不願意承擔這項責任，

663
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:29,300
Their duties, I think better. It is better that government should provide funding to different NGOs who can provide job matching service to EMs more actively. Thank you, everyone. 好，thank you，陳清華生。誒，唔該，主席，我真係好聽到勞工署頭先講嗰句説話咧，旺角嗰次佢哋嘅job fair有駐場翻譯咧。

664
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:49,310
我真係好感動㗎，因為我過去嗰兩年裏邊咧，喺荃灣嗰兩次、沙田嗰一次裏邊咧，係冇人做主場翻譯㗎。嗱，係咪即係今次講咗之後，代表以後都有？我希望真係啦，因為幾次都真係冇嘅。你哋啲同事回應就係：如果我哋有需要，街坊有需要，叫我帶埋翻嚟自己去嘅。咁如果係咪你咁講完之後，以後？

665
02:13:49,310 --> 02:14:03,040
都係每一次勞工處搞嘅南亞嘅job fair都會有要駐場翻嚟咧。我希望問一問，如果係嘅話，我覺得好嘅。第二樣嘢就係咧，頭先你講到一樣嘢，我真係再講再跟住雞蓉蛋嘅問題。你話啲街坊係會自己帶親戚上嚟幫佢翻譯。

666
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:23,330
你有冇諗過？好多人係因為冇親戚咁做，所以冇嚟到㗎。真係呢個現實係好多好多街坊係噉嘅。佢哋而家唔用就係因為你哋expect佢哋大家帶親戚上嚟幫佢翻譯㗎嘛。佢嚟到嘅話，你啲同事都冇主動去幫佢request。因為正如我所講，你相唔相信成個政府只有得三百幾個需request需要啊？係真係唔止嘅。

667
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:33,550
希望重新考慮個訓練啲員工，有啲成日挑剔，同埋真係希望考慮你考慮去誒派翻啲南馬瑞嘅童工喺裏邊去幫嗰啲小聚揾工啊，唔該。Okay, Mr. Kim.

668
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:37,850
係啊，我覺得係誒，即係。

669
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:58,140
投訴啦就已經太多啦，喺睇下點樣係解決啲問題啦，揾啲解誒即係方案啦。喺我覺得每個區縣咧，石柱樓咧，起碼有請請一個小民族嘅誒即係staff啦，喺即係有時譬如話佢哋起碼佢哋知道係我哋。

670
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:18,150
屬於嘅係香港人噉啊，我哋都有個代表喺政府部門裏面噉啊。即係佢哋有時喺誒資料少嘅誒資料少，同埋誒即係冇呢個知識係去邊度誒問啲問題啊，或者點樣處理嗰啲問問題啊啊溝通嘅方面嘅問題啊。

671
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:20,950
噉啊，我覺得係噉樣就會好啲啦。

672
02:15:21,370 --> 02:15:41,380
係，噉啊，仲有一樣嘢咧，啊，其實我覺得而家本，啊，即係啊，呢呢，啊，呢個呢個時呢個時候咧，最大嘅問題咧，小民族嘅誒各方面咧，就係即係啊，外國，即係外籍嘅百香港人咧，就屋㗎，啊，因為租金太貴，噉啊，佢揾多一。

673
02:15:41,380 --> 02:16:01,390
揾到嘅錢就有限，咁喺佢已經一一係交租啊，定係養屋企嗰啲人啊，或者自己咧，係呢個好大問題啦。所以，我覺得政府咧一定係處理，即係首先呢個最大嘅問題啦。呢個呢個問題咧就搞到好多人咧，即係佢交租就一定要交租，如果唔係咧，比

674
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:21,400
業主踢出門口㗎啦，噉啊喺跟住佢就受害者啊，即係誒即係受苦啦。喺佢啲仔女啊，或者佢自己啊，喺誒交學費啊，或者其他方面啊，似乎有好多咧都係湊唔到錢，翻翻去貪親戚啊，或者噉樣嘅問題啦。我哋聽得多啦呢啲。

675
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:41,410
OK，如果大家唔反對，容許我去到七點鐘啊。阿仁，你咪個第二輪，希望你到一兩分鐘之內講嘛。係啦，好短嘅啫。其實頭先誒有位朋友講話，即係勞工處應該有個少數族裔嘅一個就業嘅專門嘅服務啦。但係如果我聽誒勞工處講咧，其實佢哋有嘅。

676
02:16:41,790 --> 02:16:57,720
點解咧？我我自己覺得即係而家即係啲官僚嗰啲嘢咧，你要聽，即係你要好似即係誒同佢即係誒行迷宮噉，即係喺啲迷團裏邊揾翻個位出嚟。因為佢頭先講話有個人資誒個人服務喎。

677
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:18,030
即係個人嘅特別服務喎，轉介服務喎。嗯。但係只不過咧個問題係邊度咧？全世界都可能冇人知道佢有依個服務咁解嘅啫。嚇，噉係咪即係我想問翻係誒阿梁太？噉你點樣去係咪？總之而家我哋教曬呢啲小眾族裔，一去嗰度我要個人資訊服誒。

678
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:38,040
轉介服務，噉你即刻會畀到佢嚇，因為佢而家你只不過你咧就根本唔去宣傳，所以冇人知道，全世界都冇人知道依樣嘢係咪咁咧？我想問，即係你你其實你個個人轉介服務係根本係係點樣運作咧？係咪啊？即係多數其實都冇人識得會要求依樣嘢嘅分分鐘啊！

679
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:53,860
可唔可以解釋下？然後跟住就答翻我哋啲朋友，就係團體就係喂。早知你舉手，我哋教啲人舉手，噉你就有㗎啦。噉我哋話你係咪有噉嘅資源先？倒翻轉又倒翻轉要問喎嚇。OK，好啊，係咪六公署頭先？

680
02:17:54,590 --> 02:17:56,440
頭先我解釋一下。

681
02:17:56,750 --> 02:18:06,650
幾即係簡單講一講。冇問題，簡單，我得咗六分鐘嘅，唔想再談啦。翻譯服務啦，咁如果我哋係大型嘅專題招聘會咧，我哋係會安排駐場嘅翻譯嘅。

682
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:18,580
但係，如果係一般嘅招聘會咧，就有需要嘅時候，因為比較個需求冇咁大咧，就小型嗰啲即係地區性嗰啲咧，我就會用誒利用呢個用户中心嗰個電話翻會議嗰個翻譯嘅。

683
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,400
咁另外咧就講翻誒。

684
02:18:22,970 --> 02:18:37,560
我哋嗰個工作啦，其實我哋而家咧就有十十二個就中心，咁嚟緊咧會成立第十三個喺東湧嘅，咁所以咧我哋透過每一個中心咧就係同個地區性嘅僱主啦就聯絡啦，同埋地區嘅嘅。

685
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:57,970
非政府機構咧係一齊做一齊做嘢嘅，噉係幫啲小族裔咧就揾工啊，同埋係誒透過啲N G O咧就揾嗰啲小族裔咧上嚟接受我哋嘅服務嘅。噉我哋覺得呢個模式咧就比較好嘅，因為如果你話專門成立一個科咧，就可能即係一個點咧，噉就變咗就唔係可以咁噉就區即係可以個個區。

686
02:18:57,970 --> 02:19:17,980
去到可以誒滿足到啊！咁而另外咧，就誒關於嗰個服務咧，嗰個個人諮詢服務咧，我哋係每一個中心都有嘅。咁任何有需要嘅人士，即係唔限於呢個誒，少數人士咧，都可以利用嘅。咁但係當然咧，通常我一般嚟講，同事會見到咧係少數人士嘅求職者上嚟我哋中心咧，都會特別向佢推介嘅。

687
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:21,280
咁所以依個服務咧係冇問題嘅，一定係可以安排得到。

688
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:41,600
O.K.啊，民政署有冇嘢補充？誒，多謝主席。咁咧，就想有誒幾個資料補充啦嚇。第一咧，就係我哋個翻譯服務咧嚇，如果係對於嗰個小數族裔嘅使用者嚟講咧，係免費嘅嚇。咁如果個別如果係誒部門用到嘅時候咧，我哋先著量向呢個部門去收取翻有關費用嘅啫。只記得。

689
02:19:41,600 --> 02:20:01,610
第二咧就係我哋頭先講咗嘅啦，會係加強個宣傳嘅，希望可以令至頭先提過嘅部門嘅前線嘅同事咧都可以即係得悉呢一個嘅計劃，同埋都可以即係facilitate或者係促進大家去用啦嚇。仲有嘅咧就係想講翻我哋誒，其實喺來年除咗頭先講緊嘅，即係一啲新嘅支援服務中心啊。

690
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:21,620
或者係青少年大事計劃啊，仲有係一啲嘅青少年嘅即係小組啦。喺而家我哋嘅中心裏邊之外咧，我哋民政事務總署都會係去誒徵聘少數族裔嘅人士嘅嚇。噉我哋而家計劃之中咧係有五名嘅即係誒合約嘅員工啦嚇，連埋我哋頭先提過嘅即係不同嘅項目咧係。

691
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:41,630
連同呢一個嘅非政府機構一齊去即係推誒去去推行嘅時候咧，我哋預計喺誒來年咧誒少數族裔嘅誒全職嘅員工咧係會由六十五名啦，係增加到三十，即係增加多三十名去到九十五名嘅呢個全職嘅喺非全職嗰方面咧係會由誒。

692
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:46,830
五十多名咧就增加三十名，去到誒八十多名噉樣嘅嚇，但係唔可以有個政策。

693
02:20:47,300 --> 02:21:07,310
即係唔可以個政策幾多百分比係少數族類誒？呢個係我哋自己誒按住工作嘅需要去即係做一個嘅安排嘅。O K，阿阿林翠萍，你先有有冇要總結？係啦，誒就住培訓嗰方面咧，就誒頭先都介紹過誒顧員再培訓嗰個服務啦。不過我喺度咧。

694
02:21:07,310 --> 02:21:27,320
就想加多點咧，其實誒，即係僱員再培訓局咧，佢即係誒好誒都想好了解翻嗰個少數就業人士個培訓或者係嗰個就業需要嘅時候咧，佢哋係其實誒成立咗一個焦點小組嘅。咁焦點小組咧係有少數族裔嘅誒團體嘅代表，亦都有一啲非政府機構。

695
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:39,240
嘅代表喺入邊嘅，咁所以我哋希望，如果係少數族裔人士，如果佢喺嗰個培訓嗰方面，誒，即係有啲咩意見需要咧，可以透過呢個焦點小組咧，去在培訓局嚟到反映嘅。

696
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:47,620
O.K.咁因為時間都差唔多，我我誒最後啊嘛一分鐘啫，我未必有得答你嘅，因為時間夠啦，已經係。

697
02:21:48,810 --> 02:21:49,730
你講。

698
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:51,170
噉啊，因為頭先。

699
02:21:51,450 --> 02:22:11,460
講你繼續。誒，因為頭先佢回應翻之後，先阿議員嗰個問題啦嚇。其實我有啲失望就係話佢唔去回應翻，即係個surface bidding個不公或者唔唔唔透明性嘅問題，而係執著一啲用詞。我想請即係立法會議員去監察，即係嚟緊嗰啲surface bidding，即係究竟係咪有公平性同埋公開性咧？即係。

700
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:31,470
講公平性究竟係講個背景，定係講個服務質素，同埋嗰個地區同消數做嘢個網絡？我哋我諗我呢個意見唔係淨我意見，我係好多社福界我哋行家都係意見，只不過可能我方便講多即係咁講嚇。即係當時嚟講，即係如果係一個機構冇乜經驗之下，即係可能得半年消數做嘢嘅經驗之下，就可以不。

701
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:51,480
B到兩個service centre係邊個部門啊？誒，民政署啊，誒H A D嚇，H A D嚇，當時service be定嚇噉就之後嘅服務其實亦都睇唔到佢有啲咩特別嘅即係優質嘅服務，反而係好雜症頭畀人感覺係蛇齋餅種啦。咁甚至係利益啊，即係有啲誒誒誒誒誒係啦。咁所以我想請大家即係監察你。

702
02:22:51,480 --> 02:23:11,490
嘅，我surface centre嗰個必定噉嘅。民政署有冇反應嘅呢個係係啊，主席多謝嚇。我想回應一下咧，就政府係透過公平、公開同埋公正嘅程序咧，係有一個跨部門嘅即係評審小組咧，係作出一個嘅決定嘅。咁所以咧，其實我哋係誒喺唔同嘅誒嘅評估嘅標準裏邊咧，都係有。

703
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:31,500
誒一男子嘅考慮嘅，呢個係我哋透過呢一個嘅公平嘅程序咧而得出一個結果嘅。咁同埋我哋都係有，除咗數字之外咧，就住個服務質素都係有一個監察。多謝。噉你畀咗佢之後，你睇翻佢實際做做咗啲咩出嚟？嗰個做嗰個應該就係檢討嘅一個報告，或者係如果呢位朋友可以將有關嘅。

704
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:36,440
資料都書面畀咗我哋，等我哋議員都知道實際係點樣啊嘛，噉我。

705
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:56,730
攞咗啲資料之後，我哋有得跟有得追嘅。今日誒時間差唔多要過曬鐘㗎啦，噉就誒對小組作業咧，有幾個大嘅原則問題，頭先提過唔重複啦，就係都未處理到，亦都係甚至冇部門嘅誒政府嘅負責人，包括顧問委員會成員喺度嘅。咁誒呢個我哋表示遺憾。噉我哋就呢啲問題會繼續追。噉我相信遲。

706
02:23:56,730 --> 02:24:16,740
組咧就係我哋都會誒再會開類似嘅會議咧，係要扶貧委員會嘅負責小組嘅委員會個小組咧嘅成員啊，即係個官員咧嚟到呢度再同我哋解答頭先有關嘅一啲未答嘅問題。咁誒，各位小組嘅朋友，大家就唔使咁擔心，或者放少少放心啦。雖然我哋冇權啦，但係我哋都會喺。

707
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:36,040
呢個問題會攬住政府唔放㗎啦。誒，大家相信我哋在座呢幾個議員都呢方面都有有經驗，將將政府噉，我哋會繼續幫手喺度方面。大家大家有啲咩問題，有咩資料要我哋知嘅，就大家又唔好客氣，可以寫畀我哋秘書處，我哋秘書幫我哋傳譯，好嘛？好，咁唔該曬大家，唔該曬。
