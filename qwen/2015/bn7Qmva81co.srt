1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
二零一五年税務修訂第二號條例草案。

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:13,150
本會現在恢復為二零一五年仲裁修訂條例草案嘅二讀辯論。

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,530
啊！

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:26,470
深意上述嘅條例草案嘅委員會主席梁繼昌議員會就委員會嘅報告向本會發言，梁繼昌議員。

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,280
先生，主席，在我作為主席委員會主席的職能下，

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,420
我報告了 deliberations of the Bills Committee。

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,740
The Bills Committee supports the Arbitration Amendment Bill 2015.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:54,580
which seeks to make it clear that parties opting for domestic arbitration and specifying the number of arbitrators in an arbitration agreement.

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,230
may still retain their rights by virtue of Section 100 of the Arbitration Ordinance, Cap 609.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,280
to seek assistance from courts for matters set out in section two to section seven of Schedule Two of the Ordinance.

11
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:23,280
And update for the purpose of the ordinance, the list of parties to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958.

12
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,570
refer to as the New York Convention.

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,990
by adding the new parties, namely Bhutan, Burundi and Guana.

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:45,540
By adding British Virgin Islands to the entry for the United Kingdom, and by amending Bolivia to Bolivia, per national state of, in the schedule to the arbitration.

15
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,990
Parties to New York Convention Order, Cap 609 Sublegislation A。

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
委員會指出。

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:05,610
In order to remove the legal uncertainties relating to the opt-in mechanism provided for domestic arbitration under Part 11 of the Arbitration Ordinance.

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,350
It is necessary to, amongst other things.

19
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,170
Amend Section 23, 3 to clarify that.

20
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:25,420
If the parties fail to agree on the number of arbitrators in an arbitration, and Section 1 of Schedule 2 to the ordinance does not apply.

21
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,810
such number is to be either one or three.

22
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,920
As decided by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre.

23
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,250
B. amend section 102B, Roman letter two.

24
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:57,380
to remove the reference to section 1 of Schedule 2, so that section 100 does not apply only if the arbitration agreement has provided expressly that any of the provisions of Schedule 2, other than section 1, applies or does not apply.

25
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,020
and see.

26
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,000
Amend Section 1 of Schedule 2 so that for an arbitration to which Section 1 of Schedule 2 applies.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,240
任何 dispute arising between the parties to the arbitration agreement concerned.

28
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,350
是 to be submitted to a sole arbitrator for arbitration.

29
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,940
如果 parties 失敗， to agree on the number of arbitrators.

30
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:41,330
The Bills Committee also notes that updating the list of State Parties to the New York Convention is to comply with obligations under the New York Convention to recognise and enforce arbitral awards made in contracting parties, so that arbitral awards made in new contracting states to the New York Convention.

31
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,590
such as Bhutan could be enforced by Hong Kong courts and vice versa.

32
00:03:48,570 --> 00:04:01,030
委員會沒有提出反對在委員會階段提出的修改，由司法長官提出，將巴勒斯坦列入仲裁程序的安排。

33
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,860
parties to New York Convention order.

34
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,250
作為《state of Palestine》 acceded to the New York Convention on the 2nd of January 2005.

35
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,380
and has become a new contracting party to the convention on the 2nd of April 2005.

36
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:26,950
法案委員會，Mr. President， has not proposed to move any C S A to the amendment bill.

37
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,140
Next, Mr. President, I would like to give my personal views on this bill.

38
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:42,420
These days, arbitration has indeed become the most sensible option for individuals or companies wishing to settle a dispute.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,570
gone are the days when threats to take legal action led to lengthy legal battles in a court of common law.

40
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,500
with often uncertain and very expensive outcomes.

41
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,960
even when a judgement is finally reached, this could then be followed.

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,770
by years of appeals and further litigation, and a difficulty to enforce the decision internationally.

43
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,220
arbitration is a much cheaper.

44
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,060
一更有效率的措施，來解決爭端。

45
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,620
它 finds solutions tailored to fit the problems of both sides.

46
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,990
And unlike.

47
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,140
a full litigation in courts.

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,900
once the decision is reached.

49
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,450
It is final.

50
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,770
There are further risks of litigation and no appeals.

51
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,510
國際仲裁有優勢，於進行爭議解決。

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,800
在一個中立的環境，與對比一個國家法院，有它自己的本地語言和法律。

53
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,050
those laws may not be developed for international commercial disputes.

54
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,310
The arbitration tribunal panel is made up of industry experts and lawyers who are independent of the parties.

55
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,180
Usually, between one and three panel members are selected through discussion and agreement between the parties.

56
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:20,610
The final decision of an arbitration panel is enforceable across the globe under the provisions of the New York Convention.

57
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,070
which has 149 nation signatories.

58
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,050
under arbitration， any proceedings remain completely confidential.

59
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,580
In order to protect any trade secrets or competitive practices from being made public.

60
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:45,710
Next, I would like to cover why Hong Kong is often chosen as a seat for arbitration.

61
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,260
And Hong Kong has the best facilities, indeed, and is the best location for the world for arbitration.

62
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,260
First of all, I think Hong Kong is accessible and well connected to all other major cities of the world.

63
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,630
好 transport links and advanced infrastructures make Hong Kong.

64
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,180
The international business preferred choice for arbitration.

65
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,500
香港國際機場是連接至超過180個全球目的地。

66
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,980
by more than a thousand daily flights.

67
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,220
可靠、 efficient， and reasonably priced.

68
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:35,740
香港的本地交通系統是世界級，which means that wherever one chooses to stay in the city, one is always conveniently placed.

69
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:45,010
香港的自由 visa 政策也意味著， nationals of over 170 countries can visit us without a visa.

70
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:52,800
This speeds up the process and reduces the cost for the parties involved, and is another important reason.

71
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,480
Why Hong Kong is such a popular choice for arbitration?

72
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:06,510
Also, Hong Kong's arbitration ordinance is the only legislation in Asia which adopts the latest version.

73
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,970
《》。

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,110
這意味著，一旦一個裁決已經由一個仲裁庭作出，

75
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,910
It is enforceable in over 150 countries.

76
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,910
The Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre also offers an expedite arbitration service.

77
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,160
which if all if all parties agrees to speed up the process.

78
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,590
The resolution can be done within six months.

79
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:47,840
There is also the opportunity for parties to apply for an emergency interim relief award of no more than 15 days.

80
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,310
在早期階段的HKIAC arbitrations。

81
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,600
作為國際爭執，香港亦特別地處境有利處理涉及中國的爭執。

82
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,000
And is widely acknowledged as the natural choice for such arbitrations.

83
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,740
Unlike many other arbitration locations and national courts.

84
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,290
香港 maintains an excellent track record of global enforcement.

85
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,600
特別係喺 Mainland China。

86
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:30,150
As well as signing up to the New York Convention, Hong Kong has also entered into separate arrangements on mutual enforcement awards with Mainland China and Macau.

87
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,190
perhaps the most important reason why Hong Kong is best suited for arbitration.

88
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,670
是 our independent legal system.

89
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,520
Our judiciaries, Mr. President, are amongst the most independent in the world.

90
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
and have a pro-arbitration attitude.

91
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,320
但，Mr. President。

92
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:00,530
我 must say this with a pinch of salt, because as you may be aware, there are a lot of pressures on the judiciaries these days, and I also hope that.

93
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,970
The fellow members, my honourable colleagues, in this chamber, can refrain.

94
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,680
from making absurd and groundless, you know, comments or criticism of the judiciary during their speech.

95
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,670
基本法的《Extra Jur》也保障了法院的終審獨立性，和，確實。

96
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,430
高等法院判決法官Law Millet。

97
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,160
Once commented in October last year that.

98
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,080
而喺佢十四年喺法庭上。

99
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,830
他從來沒有遇過任何外部的影響，從中國或任何地方。

100
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,690
他係驕傲地成為一箇世界上最強勁的上訴法院之一。

101
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,720
therefore, once an award has been made by an arbitration tribunal.

102
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,850
The courts in Hong Kong will enforce the award as a matter of common procedure.

103
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:06,990
The parties can rest assured that the court will not interfere or review an award once it has been made.

104
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,720
although the costs remain neutral and removed from the decision-making process.

105
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:24,570
They are able to offer assistance with the taking of evidence and by granting a time limit extension for an arbitral tribunal to issue an award.

106
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,860
They can also support the work of the arbitration panel by offering legal advice.

107
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,020
作為我們的法律制度，完美地適應仲裁。

108
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,300
We also have a wide range of quality professional services available, with 70 of the largest.

109
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:51,310
有The largest hundred banks operating here， and sixty five of the top hundred global law firms operating in Hong Kong.

110
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,900
When choosing independent industry and legal experts to sit on the tribunal panel,

111
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,700
The Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre provides lists of highly experienced arbitrators from a wide range of sectors.

112
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,820
For industry-specific advice, Hong Kong has a wealth of talent, including 29,000 qualified engineers.

113
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,290
37,000 accountants。

114
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,330
more than 8,500 members of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors.

115
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,710
and over 4,000 architects.

116
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,710
在律 legal profession。

117
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,870
We have 7,800 practicing solicitors.

118
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,790
和1,200 barristers。

119
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,580
In addition.

120
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:46,840
more than 1,400 foreign lawyers qualified in over 29 different overseas jurisdictions practice law in Hong Kong.

121
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,300
Outside Europe and North America.

122
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,910
The Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre is most experienced in the world.

123
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,590
它 handles around 450 disburseals every year.

124
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,720
And in 2014 alone, 93% of those disputes were international cases.

125
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:19,140
With the total value, under arbitration reaches a total of 2.4 billion US dollars.

126
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:31,000
with all these as the background, I think I would urge the members across the spectrum to support the amendment bill. Thank you, Mr. President.有冇其他言上發言？

127
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,560
如果冇嘅，我現在請就請律政司司長發言答辯。喺司長發答辯之後，辯論即告結束。律政司司長。

128
00:13:43,020 --> 00:14:03,030
代主席，首先我感謝2015年仲裁修訂條例草案法案委員會主席梁繼昌議員同埋其他委員嘅努力，令到相關審議工作順利完成。我亦都要感謝各有關嘅團體，包括係香港大律師公會、香港。

129
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:11,270
律師會、香港測量師學會同埋香港國際仲裁中心提供嘅寶貴意見。

130
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:31,560
正如我今年二月向本會提交條例草案嘅時候指出，呢一條條例草案嘅主要目的係修訂《仲裁條例》第六百零九章，以消除該條例因為第十一部為本地仲裁而設嘅可供選用機制。

131
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:51,570
制可能引起不明確嘅法律問題，因此我哋建議修訂仲裁條例，以清楚定明選擇本地仲裁嘅當事人可以自由決定仲裁員嘅人數，但係同時保留相關。

132
00:14:51,570 --> 00:15:04,980
當事人就仲裁條例附表二第二至第七條載述嘅事宜，向特區原眾法庭尋求協助嘅權利。

133
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:25,270
條例草案亦會響《仲裁紐約公約替約方令》，亦即係第六百零九章附屬法例A附表中加入一九五八年承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約，簡稱《紐約公約》四個新嘅替約。

134
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:45,280
方此外，條例草案提出嘅建議修訂，亦都會反映紐約公約一個現有替藥方嘅官方名稱有所更新，同埋另一現有替藥方將該公約嘅適用範圍擴展到去該。

135
00:15:45,280 --> 00:16:05,290
公誒替約方嘅一個領土，因應紐約公約替約方名單嘅新近變動，我稍後會響全體委員會審議階段動議一項修正案。法案委員會知悉該修正案嘅內容，亦都冇提出反對嘅。

136
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,260
嘅意見。

137
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:15,760
律政司一直係致力提升香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心嘅地位。

138
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:34,030
自現行嘅仲裁條例喺二零一一年實施以後，我哋一直係同仲裁界同埋其他持份者保持緊密嘅溝通，適時對條例、對仲裁條例作出修改。

139
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:54,320
條例草案獲得通過之後，將會有效改善為本地仲裁而設嘅可供選用機制，從而進一步完善香港嘅仲裁製度。主席，我僅此陳辭，肯請各位議員支持通過二讀條例草案。

140
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:07,530
以及我稍後動議嘅一項修正案，多謝主席。我現在向各位提出嘅代決議題係《二零一五年仲裁修訂條例草案》予以議讀，現在付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。

141
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,910
反對嘅請舉手。

142
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:16,970
我認為議題獲得在席議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

143
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:24,070
二零一五年仲裁修訂條例草案，全體委員會審議階段，本會現在成為全體委。
