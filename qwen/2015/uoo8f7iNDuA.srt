1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,600
各位委員，噉啊，因為三個人已經夠法定人數㗎啦，噉就依家可以開始開會。

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,120
噉啊！議程第一項。

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,320
就選舉主席及副主席，噉啊徵詢各位委員嘅意見。

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,990
有冇需要再選個？要重新選個？

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,980
即係依家暫時合資格嘅委員係李國麟同埋阿何俊仁兩位。

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:48,290
唔係有冇需要再選個？唔係話我啦，即係你話冇需要。佢冇需要，冇。不如你噉樣proposal整得啦。誒，我我我建議。唔係，若果你覺得冇需要，係唔使再選個嘅。冇需要選主席。係啊，冇需要選主席。冇需要。係啦，係啦。阿何俊仁議員有冇意見？係噉啊，噉我就繼續擔任呢個主席。咁第二個問題有冇需要選舉副主席？

7
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,300
需要或者唔需要呢個係誒？唔需要啦，誒唔好搞。

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:11,380
呢個係醫療保障計劃小組委員會，唔係衞生事務委員會。冇需要啊嘛，唔需要嚇。O.K.唔需要。噉就以前第二項，咁咪有兩位議員就誒喺嗰個委員會誒。

9
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,110
誒。

10
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:35,260
呢個叫做參加呢個委員會嗰個申請期限過咗之後，就要求誒參加個委員會係啊方光遠同埋莫麗江議員噉就誒，我本人就冇乜意見嘅。各位有冇有冇咩問題？贊成支持噉啊，歡迎啊方光遠同莫麗江議員肯肯參加呢個。

11
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,190
小組委員會，大家一齊齊研究下個醫保嘅問題。

12
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,550
噉啊！以前第三項嗱，咁今日主要就係講誒醫護人力規劃嘅推。

13
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,010
醫護人力個規劃。

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:00,030
同埋嗰個規管架構嘅，噉就誒，咁可以請誒政府嘅代表入嚟啦，唔該。

15
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:16,350
咁誒有關醫護人力嘅規劃同埋個規管架構咧，咁政府就分別係誒委託咗香港大學同埋中文大學作個研究嘅。香港大學負責就做嗰個人力人手嘅規劃。

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,270
嚇！中文大學就負責嗰個規管嘅研究。

17
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:34,090
噉啊，今日噉佢哋就未有嗰個最終嗰個報告嘅，嚇。咁不過我哋之前就講過話，係希望佢誒未有最終個報告之前咧，都上嚟個委員會度交代下佢哋用乜嘢方法。

18
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:45,900
去做佢哋嗰個檢討研究，咁今日就會請到係誒香港大學同埋中文大學嘅代表上嚟誒，向各位誒介紹下嘅。

19
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,590
嚇！先講。

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,510
咁一陣間會講咗誒。

21
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,620
人力規劃嗰方面嘅。

22
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:09,550
研究個模型先，噉就即係香港大學講咗先，咁跟住講完先至講誒嗰個規管架構嘅研究嘅。

23
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,190
咁若果政府同埋兩間大學嘅代表嚟到坐定定啦，噉就請啊。

24
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:42,490
秘書長講一講政介紹下政府嘅文件先啦，好嘛？係係主席，誒喺今年三月嘅小組委員會上邊咧，我哋都向大家咧介紹過有關醫護人力規劃同埋專業發展策略檢討嘅進展嘅，亦都提到咧，我哋已經委託咗香港大學同埋香港中文大學咧進行有關嘅未。

25
00:03:42,490 --> 00:04:02,500
內嗰個醫護人力需求同埋專業發展方面嘅研究，今次呢個文件同埋討論咧目的咧係向大家介紹下呢兩個研究現時嗰個進展咧嚇喺推算誒醫護人力需求方面咧，香港大學咧係正在為我哋咧係設立一套誒設立本地嘅情況而有。

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:21,170
可以調節改動咧，盡量適應將來環境變遷嘅通用嘅預測嘅模型。咁呢個模型咧，採用過往嘅醫療服務使用率嘅數據，亦都根據人口增長同埋人口變化咧，要加以調整，從而預測未來嘅醫護專業人手嘅需求嘅。

27
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:35,320
咁喺專業發展方面咧，中文大學嘅研究發現咧，喺海外唔少嘅地區咧，醫護專業人員嘅規管咧，正由醫護專業自我規管咧，誒慢慢轉為與公眾共同監管。

28
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:55,980
喺規管上咧，亦都更公開同埋更大程度咧嘅民責嘅，更是咧專業規管嘅傳頭嘅趨勢。為咗維持佢哋嘅專業水平咧，除咗強制性嘅持續進修已經成為標準嘅要求之外咧，有啲地區哋都制定誒，比如重新誒評審同埋重新考核。

29
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:15,990
等一啲進一步嘅措施。另外咧，監管機構嘅嘅調查同埋紀律處分嘅職能方面咧，亦都越嚟越趨誒分開同埋獨立，減少利益嘅衝突。喺人手供應方面咧，依賴外地嘅醫護畢業生去解決短期人手短缺問題咧，係我認為地區一般嘅做法。

30
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,580
雖然用作核實佢哋嘅專業能力嘅方式咧，亦都誒不盡相同。

31
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:41,870
跟海外地區相比咧，香港喺醫療規管方面嘅特點咧，係由個專業高度自主，負責規管嘅監管機構咧，主要由相關專業嘅成員組成。目前運作包括秘書處等咧，都係由公堂去資助嘅。除咗少數專業之外咧，香港並無強制規定醫。

32
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:55,740
醫護專業人員必須參加持續專業進修計劃，而在海外受訓嘅醫護人員咧，一般咧需通過執業資格考試咧，先可以領取正式嘅牌照喺香港嘅執業。

33
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:16,320
誒，由於醫護人員人力推算嘅工作咧，係比較複雜，同埋咧涉及嘅專業嘅範疇比較多。香港大學估計咧，係要到二零一四年，即係明年咧，先至能夠完成全部十三個專業人力嘅需求嘅預測。其中有關醫生、牙醫同埋護士嘅估。

34
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:36,330
算咧就可望咧喺明年初會完成，而中文大學方面咧亦都參考緊國際做法同埋本地持份者嘅意見咧，就香港嘅醫護專業規管同埋發展咧提出建議。我哋嘅目標咧喺二零一四年咧完成呢個策略嘅檢討。咁為咗令各個位。

35
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:43,950
睇完更加清楚兩個研究嘅進展咧，我哋今日咧就邀請咗參加兩個研究嘅兩間大學代表咧，係。

36
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:59,060
誒係啊！阿楊永強教授咧，同埋阿Doctor Johnson咧係出席個會議。誒主席，如果誒你容許嘅話咧，就係我或者邀請阿Doctor Johnson講講人力誒預測嗰個模型。

37
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:14,890
啊啊，秘書長，咁因嗱，因因秘書處畀我嗰個建議咧，就係話誒講咗人力先，噉就等我完問完問題，咁跟住先再講個規模架構噉啊，好嘛？好，咁依家就請誒Doctor Johnson講一講嗰個。

38
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,710
香港大學嗰個模型係係點嘅樣咯，好唔好？

39
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,740
得個章仔先。

40
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,910
sorry，我 hit the wrong， wrong one。

41
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,770
Good afternoon, Chairman. Thank you.

42
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,170
今天我將present。

43
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:59,980
for you the conceptual demand and supply model for the healthcare manpower projections and illustrate how these two models will be used to quantify the manpower gap.

44
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:10,450
what I will present is a generic model, as has been said earlier, and these this generic framework will be used to apply to all the

45
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,190
健康 care manpower groups that we are looking at.

46
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:24,780
But for today, I've used the doctor demand and supply projection model as an example to illustrate our purpose in going forward.

47
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,650
The purpose of the model is to project the number of doctors, which are expressed in FTEs.

48
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,020
down here.

49
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:47,970
sorry to expressed in FTEs to care for the to look after the healthcare needs for the total population to be served. So we're starting from the total population and what we want to end up with the number of

50
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,420
Doctors expressed in terms of FTE.

51
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:04,660
健康 care needs in this model are defined as realised demand or the service utilisation within the population. So everything we do will be within the service utilisation framework.

52
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:12,440
The Anderson Health Behaviour and Access to Care Model provides the underlying framework for the model.

53
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,230
and this.

54
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:25,590
Access to care model organises need in three main components: predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need.

55
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:34,330
The predisposing characteristics includes factors that underlie or predispose an individual's use of health service.

56
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,700
The enabling resources.

57
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:46,000
提供 us with the means by which we can use health resources and need, both perceived and realised or evaluated need.

58
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,370
是 strongest predictors of all health service use.

59
00:09:50,910 --> 00:10:10,920
And although there are many other characteristics that can be used within the Anderson model, the ones that we've expressed on the screen here are those we have chosen to use because they're the most consistent with and enable comparison with work the School of Public Health has done for the government previously on cost projections for.

60
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:19,650
The health protection scheme, the healthcare financing, and the long-term planning models that were prepared in conjunction with the elderly commission.

61
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,550
The data used in the model will come from the thematic household surveys, the household authority.

62
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:34,990
The Department of Health and from data from private hospitals, and the validity and reliability of this data has been well established.

63
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,670
collectively, the data will be will be fit into a neural network, which is expressed by this little widget here.

64
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,080
and this converts this information into a into the

65
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,230
FTE framework， which is what we're trying to accomplish for you。

66
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,110
The derived utilisation.

67
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,840
Is。

68
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:09,200
derive utilisation is drawn through the FTE widget, the neural network, and then gives us this the number of projected FTEs.

69
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:32,060
服務 utilisation is also influenced by externalities, and these externalities can have a positive or a negative impact on utilisation, and can have a cost or a benefit in terms of population healthcare use or cost of the healthcare delivery.

70
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,730
And there are three important externalities to be considered.

71
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:42,690
這些係科技滲透、產能變動、和補充性質和替代性質。

72
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:54,490
科技 diffusion is just as you might expect, as we become more advanced in our application of different types and

73
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:03,240
of devices and different types of products, our service delivery model changes and the way we manage patients change.

74
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:13,160
productivity change obviously comes mostly through efficiency gains and through the way we manage our healthcare service and the way we deliver our care.

75
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:32,200
complementarity and substitution you can see in many parts of the world through the differing ways that healthcare workers do their job and we need to consider different aspects of complementarity and substitution in terms of full time equivalent requirements.

76
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,330
what I have described is the core demand model.

77
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:49,460
and this model will then be stratified to project FTE requirements by service type, either for inpatients or for outpatients, and by sector, whether in the public or the private sector.

78
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,020
The inpatient sector service utilisation will be expressed as the projected number of discharges.

79
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,680
和總數量的病日。

80
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,670
和服務 utilisation for the inpatient sector will be stratified by diagnosis-related groups and by service sector.

81
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:26,040
Projection for the outpatient sector follow the same principles. However, the outpatient sector service utilisation will only be expressed as the total number of visits, as diagnosis or reason for attendance is not broadly available across sectors.

82
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,530
visits will be stratified by service specialty and by service sector.

83
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:53,270
Though the elements in the demand model are consistent throughout, the externality assumptions will vary by service type. Whether they are inpatients or outpatients, as obviously, the technology diffusion, the productivity change and complementarity and substitution vary by service sector. Whether it's in

84
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,460
或出診。

85
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:16,740
我將 now switch to the supply side of this equation. Again, this is the conceptual model, and it will be applied to all healthcare professions. As with the demand side, the objective is to project FDES. This time from the pool of available healthcare professionals, which includes both the newly eligible and

86
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
The pre-existing registrants.

87
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:29,260
The newly eligible registrants derive from two sources: local graduates and non-local graduates, and become part of the total registrants pool.

88
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,890
pre-existing registrants are those who are already registered.

89
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,180
As not all who will register pass through the renewal proportion, the widget.

90
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,270
Well.

91
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,360
pass through the renewal proportion widget to join the registrants pool.

92
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,210
although a doctor may re-register, they may not be clinically active.

93
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,470
The total number of registrants pool will be reduced by the number of clinically inactive doctors.

94
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:06,020
這些是醫生，who are no longer in medical practice but not retired, are retired or are otherwise deregistered.

95
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:14,090
The result is the number of clinically active registrants stratified by specialty and by service sector.

96
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,340
and this reflects the total hair count.

97
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:25,150
derive the number of FDEs. The clinically active pool passes through the widget for conversion to FDEs.

98
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:39,230
this widget accounts for the workforce participation rate, and converts the head count to FTEs, considering the male-to-female working hours ratio, and preference for part-time work, otherwise.

99
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:54,880
The supply model will also consider externalities, factors that incur an additional cost or benefit, and these externalities work through the workforce participation rate and include.

100
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,300
The differential capacity and work pattern by service sector.

101
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:07,560
和標準working hours， and or other overarching policy change which will impact the production and supply function.

102
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:19,680
在下係列是個例子，係時間依賴性或者遞迴性嘅投影。首先係供應側。

103
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,250
Beginning with the 2013 pre-existing registrants and the newly eligible registrants.

104
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,590
我們可以估計，The number of registered doctors.

105
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,300
這些然後分開，由那些臨牀無效和有效。

106
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,000
and the clinically active are converted to FTEs.

107
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,720
在二零一四。

108
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,810
The number of registered doctors becomes part of the pre-existing registrants pool, and the same process.

109
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,420
是follow through。

110
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,540
所以，那係一個持續的過程，係整個預測期。

111
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:11,280
This recursive process is followed for the period of the projection, and here we have projected the FDES for 2013 through 2016.

112
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,290
As for the supply model, FTE requirements are projected for the demand model.

113
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:31,250
The FTE gap between the supply and the demand model is then calculated. Obviously, these do not represent real figures, but they're just an illustration.

114
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,190
balancing this gap is the trick.

115
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,820
and requires change in both control knobs as identified in both or either of the models.

116
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,150
lastly.

117
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,690
我 want to place our approach in the context of current practice.

118
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:57,500
四 major approaches are commonly used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

119
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:05,620
needs-based models take a more normative approach and subjective approach.

120
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,470
and are less practical than what I have presented.

121
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,340
They are very data dependent.

122
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:25,940
demand utilisation models are more practical and take a more objective approach and project requirements from realised need, that is need that is expressed in utilisation.

123
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,650
所以它更 readily quantifiable， and more readily verifiable.

124
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:49,730
benchmarking is simply a population ratio and lacks the sophistication necessary to estimate manpower requirements in a complex medical economy, but is very useful in terms of placing any any country or system.

125
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:57,340
作為一個措施，與另一羣國家或系統，所以它是一個有用的指標，但係它唔係好適合做預測。

126
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,140
趨勢分析是基於總體水平時間係列歷史資料。

127
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,910
它係一個宏觀模擬模型， extrapolating from past trends.

128
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:15,610
The model presented here is a microsimulation model that is essentially demand utilisation based.

129
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:25,620
We will take a more macro approach to the projections and use trend analysis and benchmarking for the sensitivity analysis in future stages of our work.

130
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,040
Thank you. That's all I have to present.

131
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,810
O.K.唔該曬，Doctor Johnson。

132
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:44,560
嗱，咁依家就開放畀各位委員提問。嗱，咁上年我哋個委員會咧，就即係因為個效率嘅問題，就係誒。

133
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,620
委員問嘅時間個鐘先喐，政府答嗰陣時個鐘就唔喐嘅。

134
00:19:50,900 --> 00:20:08,830
啊，即係好似我哋嘅選舉嗰陣時辯辯論噉樣，咁所以委員就無需要誒發表太多嘅意見去壓曬嗰幾分鐘嘅時間。即係若果你發問嗰陣時有問政，譬如你淨係問咗一分鐘嘅話，噉佢即使答咗十分鐘，噉你仍然有一分鐘可以追問。

135
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,280
明明。

136
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,070
即係亦都費事行得嗰個時間咁實，所以就淨係個鐘就淨係。

137
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,390
計委員發問個問題嘅時間，咁上年嘅經驗咧，原來三分鐘咧。

138
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,450
都已經係好長㗎啦。

139
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:40,200
即係，若果淨係畀你問嘢嘅話，唔發表意見咧，三分鐘已經好長啦。噉我建議就試一試兩分鐘，睇下大家夠唔夠用。因為若果畀兩分鐘時間你發問，加埋政府答咧，可能每一個委員都已經會用咗去六七分鐘嘅時間㗎啦。

140
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:54,660
好嘛，咁試一試兩分鐘，就淨係計各位發問嘅時間，政府答嘅時間就唔計嘅。咁另外，若果喺過程當中，我哋自己之間有討論嘅話咧，咁個鐘就係會停咗佢嘅。

141
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,160
好嘛，嚇，噉啊！

142
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,890
依家有冇？

143
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,070
啲嗱啱，因為啱啱大家啊睇，即係聽過啊DoctorJohnson嗰個。

144
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,640
個幻燈片嗰個。

145
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,230
簡介啦，咁暫時嚟講有冇問題？

146
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:19,300
若果各位未有問題嘅，就我問先。咁見到你哋有有人舉手問嗰陣時，我先再開始計時間啦，好冇？

147
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,400
嚇！暫時未有問題係咪？

148
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,000
噉啊！

149
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:31,350
我啲英文就麻麻，噉我都係用中文問，噉啊請阿多多張神大哥移同啦嚇，OK。

150
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,520
不過啲。

151
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,850
英文麻麻之餘，我啲中文都麻麻，有時候可能要講翻一兩句、一兩隻字嘅英文。

152
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,260
嗱，噉我都理解到計算人手就有好多方法嘅嚇。

153
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,440
噉啊！

154
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,270
你呢個模型入邊有冇一個？

155
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,620
反。

156
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,510
匯機就係即係feedback mechanism。

157
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:24,400
嚇咁等誒嗰個估算出嚟嗰個同現實係有差距嗰陣時，可以好快咁調整得到嘅咧。嗱，因為呢一個我見到你呢個模型咧，主要嚟講咧就係一個推算模型，就係一個誒硬照形式嘅噉嘅推算模型。

158
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:39,590
就推算，誒，譬如話五年之後需要幾多人手啊？噉嘅樣，你就估睇下個服務需求啊。咁個服務需求有好多因素去計算服務需求啦。嚇，噉你又主要嚟講，我見到係一個推算模型嚇。

159
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:46,150
咁但係佢會入邊有冇一個機制，就係話當誒法國個推算？

160
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,280
錯咗嗰陣時，咁可以盡快調整得到嘅咧。

161
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,780
嚇啊！理理論上我就問啊，秘書長，秘書長字揾一個人答，咁而家秘書長請你答。

162
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,150
嗯。

163
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,270
嗯。

164
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,860
We've been asked by the government to provide a projection model.

165
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:25,970
And that's what we're doing, providing the projection. I understand your, if I understand your correct question correctly.

166
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,890
你係問，如果係有冇一個方法可以？

167
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,770
test the model.

168
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,580
for its accuracy in sort of five years time.

169
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:52,380
誒，唔係淨係唔係淨係試佢嗰個準確嘅問題，而係你所有模型咧都一定會有個誤差㗎嘛嚇。譬如咁講咧，你你推算咗一個數目出嚟，譬如你你話五年之後要係嗯。

170
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
萬五個醫生咁講。

171
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,550
嚇！咁所有呢啲推算，你都會有個。

172
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:07,370
唔差，譬如你有個誒所謂啲ninety ninety five percent confidence interval咁講，你講噉，若果你推算係萬五。

173
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,670
噉，但係若果你嗰個，

174
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,980
嗰個confidence interval，譬如你係幅度由一萬去到三萬嘅，咁噉。

175
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:23,520
嗰個準程度就好差，即係噉樣就同冇推算一樣嘅啫喎，嚇，咁所以。

176
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,350
你除咗一個推線之外咧？

177
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,450
仲要有一個機制咧，就係。

178
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,920
去好快咁調。

179
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:45,040
截到嚇，即係去即刻有個好快嘅反應，知道你推算出已已經有啲唔差嗰陣時，即刻去調整誒嗰個供應啊，噉樣人手嘅供應啊，噉樣㗎嘛，係咪？

180
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:52,650
嚇！噉你呢個模型入邊有冇考到考慮到點樣去調整嗰個推算啊？

181
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,040
yes, we have. the model is based on historical data.

182
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,620
And on as many years of historical data as are reliable and valid.

183
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,820
And for the most part, that's about eight years of data.

184
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:20,570
The model can very quickly adjust to changes in any new data that is fed into it at any time, so it's designed to be able to pick up.

185
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,470
新資料 on a rolling basis.

186
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:30,930
所以，當新資訊是 available，新資訊可以被添加到模型，它不一定要被再生成。

187
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,310
所以，yes， is your is the answer. It can. It can.

188
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,780
quickly.

189
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,790
adapt to changes.

190
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,540
That are available and represented by the data.

191
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:57,150
嗱，你若果話一有新嘅數據，即刻可以調整咁講啊，噉係唔係即係你會將呢一個數學工具，你做咗整咗呢個模型，呢個數學工具啊？

192
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:07,190
誒做咗出嚟之後，誒你會將呢件工具交畀政府，或者交畀將呢件工具公開佢。咁譬如咁講。

193
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,430
誒，你推算話誒？

194
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,080
誒五年之後要多多五千個醫生。

195
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,610
嚇，假設咁講，但係發覺一到下年。

196
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,900
新畢業出嚟嘅醫科學生已經揾唔到工做。

197
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:44,720
噉你又將呢個新嘅數據，即係由政府或者其他相關人士將佢輸入去呢個模型入邊，噉就會即刻調整到五年之後，原來唔係需要五千個，只係需要一千個噉嘅樣。係唔係你會即係發展咗呢個模型之後，會將呢個模型交畀政府，亦都可以公開畀大家睇到嘅咧？

198
00:26:45,550 --> 00:27:05,560
就主席或者我誒，我補充一點就係誒，正如你所講，就係成個模型嘅設計目的係噉嘅，因為以往嗰時咧就做一次，噉啊將來五年、十年幾多人啊噉樣樣，咁因為我哋就唔想重蹈覆轍，咁所以因為噉嘅時候，點解呢個咁複雜嘅模型嘅時候先啦？阿Donald Johnson提到入邊，所以好多個widgets嗰啲嗰啲地方。

199
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:17,810
就係話，即係佢個模型咧，就設計到一啲主要影響人力供求嘅因素啊，譬如大學畢業生啊，而家有幾多退休人士啊，或者係誒佢誒誒。

200
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:38,100
有幾多係註冊咗唔做嘢嘅等等，即係呢類噉嘅數字。咁所以咧，佢做完之後咧，我哋個目的咧就話佢嗰個模型咧會交畀我哋啊。咁將來咧，我哋譬如因為佢呢啲模型每一次嘅時候咧，你差唔多係好多年後、五六年後咧先才能睇到個後果。噉我哋打算係定期，譬如一兩年啊，一年或者兩年咧就跟。

201
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:58,110
根據當時嘅情況同埋個模型嘅預測，就睇睇佢個出入情況啊。如果係出入唔大嘅，當然即係證明個模型個推算係已經即係幾比較可靠啦。咁但係如果發現就係話啊，突然間需求係大增，或者頭先你所講就話好多畢業生出嚟係冇嘢做嘅時候咧，我就即刻可以檢討就個模型入邊邊。

202
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:18,120
邊一個環節佢個預算出咗問題嚇，同現實係唔同，噉我就可以重再run過，即係用最新嘅數據啊，係加翻落去噉，然之後就不斷不斷係你講嗰個就自我即係完善化佢咁解噉，所以呢個係一個即係較為新嘅誒誒預測嘅方法嚟嘅。

203
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,670
嗱，開始係委員提問，我我提得一句啫。

204
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:35,230
即係就誒，雖然你話件嘢就好複雜啊，不過點複雜嘅嘢，我相信香港都有好多人會識得去分析嘅。咁頭先阿Dr. Johnson提嗰個neural network嗰樣嘢咧，其實我一九九七年就已經開始玩㗎啦。

205
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,420
我都相當之熟悉。

206
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:46,240
咁誒，你係咪可以將嗰個模型亦都公開畀大家去睇？有兩個作用嘅，一就係誒。

207
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,950
大家可以參詳下嗰個模型。

208
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,580
誒。

209
00:28:52,790 --> 00:29:12,800
有幾完善啦，可以參與多啲意見啦嚇。第二就係亦都作為畀誒公眾一個監察，即係大家睇翻同一條數，即係唔好爭呀話多啊，一話話少啊。總之大家睇埋同一個工具嘅話噉，而且我覺得呢啲唔係咩秘密嚟啊，係嘛？即係若果誒大學。

210
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:32,810
做完件嘢，交畀政府亦都可以公開畀大家去參詳同埋係去測試佢個效果啊噉樣嘅係咪？陳主席，我明㗎你意思，但係咧就即係我哋睇睇用咩方法就係可以咁做咧，因為噉佢係一個電腦模型啊，咁所以佢點都話我玩咗十蚊公，所有電腦嘅人都係手計出嚟先㗎。係啊，咁所以咧。

211
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:52,820
就係或者我哋我哋研究一下，即係將來講，譬如我哋發現真係佢個預測出咗問題嘅時候，噉我哋都會不斷會宣佈個數字。你唔好預測出咗問題先啦，你直情畀我同我都話參詳下聽你個模型O唔O K？我都話我都話玩咗十幾年啦已經。咁或者我哋同大陸方面睇睇嗰個實際上個情況係點樣可以就係公開到出嚟，因為佢。

212
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:59,920
基本上係一個喺個電腦入邊run緊嘅program嚟㗎嘛，嚇。好啦，咁依家誒各位問題啊，方剛議員。

213
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,090
誒，唔該，主席。

214
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,470
誒。

215
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,380
Dr Johnson， is it easier for us to ask questions in English or in Chinese for you？

216
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:22,090
Okay, according to your model, okay, do you take in consideration of couple factors? One is our ageing population.

217
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,840
And secondly, is the as the people are getting older.

218
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,380
我認為，The complications of their cases.

219
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,380
會 be more complicated.

220
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,750
可能 require more time.

221
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:45,270
and the last factor is also the consultation period for a doctor to see the patients, because right now in the public the clinic.

222
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:51,640
The consultation time they give is very very short, less than five minutes per patient.

223
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:58,480
所以，你考慮到那，yes，still using five minutes or maybe a little bit longer.

224
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,830
在你嘅模型計算。

225
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,510
係。

226
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,410
到了總結。

227
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,860
The model draws on data that is available from both the public and the private sector.

228
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,220
and the public sector and the private sector data are able enable us to.

229
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,660
assess both.

230
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,260
The age-specific changes in the population, because we're using the census data.

231
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,880
和 census age specific projections and.

232
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
also， we。

233
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,090
用 The。

234
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:46,410
公共 sector and private sector data for estimating workload. So yes, we can do both.

235
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,900
We can both adjust for population dynamics, and we can adjust for

236
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,020
different characteristics of work.

237
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,050
within by sector.

238
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:12,120
So actually, all these three factors you have already put it in into your model. Yes. Okay. How about the consultation period that you use? Are you using still five minutes or a little bit longer in the future?

239
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:19,780
We use the data that has been reported by doctors in the health manpower survey.

240
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,880
所以，as they have reported their information, we have used it.

241
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,760
哼。

242
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,820
Thank you。嗱，我我咁講你。

243
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,780
嗰個A組啊，見到你放咗喺呢個一嗰度啦。

244
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,900
I mean the the factor, the age factor you have put in, the

245
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:56,850
P. This posing characteristic. Yes. Number one, age, sex group. Okay. What about the consultation consultation time? Consultation. No, no. The consultation time comes. Where do you put it? The supply model. Yeah. In the supply model. In the supply model.

246
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,420
呢個。

247
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,320
yes.

248
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:18,420
Where, in the preference for part-time work in the workforce participation rate, it is included in that factor of the workforce participation rate. Workforce

249
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,090
好，睇先，睇先，Right here.

250
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,380
我用consultation time mean。

251
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:37,950
喺喺，過去，一個醫生會 spend 約五分鐘去見一個病人。Well，會，你 expect 在未來，噉，我我病人會 expect 十分鐘，或者。

252
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,520
15， a longer time。

253
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,790
That will use up more manpower. Yes, that is.

254
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,900
How can that be explained in the workforce participation rate?

255
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,770
We are using current.

256
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,520
data that is available from the health manpower surveys.

257
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,700
and.

258
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,140
any scenarios that we want to draw on to project.

259
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,780
不同政策 initiatives 或 changes in practice 可以 fit into the model.

260
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:28,070
阿秘書長嘅補充啊，主席，我噉樣補充啊，方議員嘅問題咧，就係話誒，頭先啊Doctor Johnson幾邊強講咧，就係話第一就話呢個模型，等呢個表達出嚟咧，係一個好概括性噉，因為佢哋非常之複雜，譬如好似話個workforce participation rate咁先算咧，喺個model入邊做咧，係根據即係現時嗰個情況。

261
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:48,080
誒而家醫生嘅工作嘅時間啊，佢睇幾多症啊，咁用嗰個先，咁計一條數出嚟。咁答你個問題咧，就係話我哋而家咧係冇預測到將來，譬如由十分鐘去到廿分鐘噉，但係個模型咧會容許我哋，譬如話我用而家嗰個工作環境嗰個performance，咁咪project長遠係需要咁多，但係我哋。

262
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,870
可以應用嘅模型咧，就如果測試就譬如我話，我將佢個時間睇證時間加長一倍。

263
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:14,240
個需求會點咧？咁呢個咧個模型就容許我哋做到呢樣嘢啦。嚇，就係話，因為佢作為大學咧，佢唔應該喺個政策上啊指導我哋就啊，而家醫生可能你講你講嘅認為十分鐘係唔夠嘅，應該用二十分鐘噉啊。但係佢個模型係畀到我哋嘅時候咧，我哋可以咁做嘅，就係話，譬如我哋認為啊，我哋而家可能。

264
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:30,490
資源，譬如改善嗰個醫生睇症嘅時間長啲啦，咁如果加入去嘅時候，即刻就會出到啊嚟緊。可能咧就我需要唔係一萬三千個醫生，可能一萬五千個醫生。嗱，如果我加多三啊percent時間咧，可能一萬七千個醫生，即係變咗佢係畀我哋噉樣預測得到。

265
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:49,670
噉你而家講嗰個淨係個model啫嘛，係嘛？跟而家個咁如果如果好似你頭先講個model係O.K.嘅，咁好似我頭先講個三樣嘢，噉你話啊，我嗰個人口老化，咁照而家呢個rate，我擺個即係擠落去。

266
00:35:49,950 --> 00:36:09,960
係嘛？咁如果話嗰啲嗰啲病症係越嚟越複雜嘅，嗰啲越嗰啲入曬㗎啦。咁又擺落去，係嘛？咁而家譬如話，而家好似你而家我睇，淨係五分鐘嘅啫。咁將來我可能咪誒，我希望長少少七分鐘。噉你起碼呢三樣嘢你擺咗落去先。咁然後你睇到啊，我而家爭幾？

267
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:29,970
多人咧噉，噉啊，起碼有啲嘢即係有個實物睇到啊嘛！你今話大學佢淨係做個model畀你，啲嘢唔擠入去嘅咧，我哋乜都睇唔到喎。啊，就主席我一答答就係話，首先頭先啊，議員提嗰三樣嘢咧，譬如你話人口老化，即係人口嘅年齡改變嗰啲咧，因為嗰啲係個事實，亦都係幾準。

268
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:49,980
正確嘅預測已經擺咗入咗去㗎啦。咁譬如而家就病症嘅嚟緊嘅複雜化，咁嗰啲都知道，亦都擺咗落去。但至於醫生睇證時間嗰樣嘢咧，係基本上咧就係話你係睇睇你嗰個決定係要求嘅幾耐時間嗰個咧，佢係容許佢而家用係用翻現時嗰個情況。但係咧，因為我哋呢次解咧係解個模。

269
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,910
型入邊嗰個構構思構造嘅啫，個數據未出嘅，因為我哋將佢而家。

270
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:16,410
即係整誒處理好發展咗呢個模型之後咧，下一步咧就會所以run個數據出嚟，下一次咧就會run個數據出，run多數據出嚟，同我再同大家簡介就介紹就係解釋畀人聽就係現時長遠我哋預測五年、十年、十五年之後係幾多需要幾多個醫生，咁而家今日咧只係講講，即係佢大學方。

271
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,460
幫我哋設計個模型，個進展個數據未有嘅。

272
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,690
咁而家用而家嘅數字啊！

273
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:36,420
如果你用而家用用用今日嘅數字擺落呢個model出嚟，睇到睇落嚟，我哋爭嘅醫生同我哋嘅實實在在，你哋估計爭嘅醫生係咪咪符合咧？

274
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:57,260
即係用今日個model擺落去啫嘛。啊，有冇有冇個數字睇出嚟？誒，未暫時未做個數字嘅。即係佢而家仍然係寫緊嗰個程嗰個程式就嗰個數據。幫佢整好咗個電腦模型之後咧，都要測試下下，用翻皮以往嘅幾十年前嘅數字啊等等check睇佢準唔準，有幾多條準成。

275
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:17,270
咁完咗呢個部分啦，將來咧我哋就用真真真正現時嘅數據，將來所知嘅發展嘅數據、人口增長啊、年齡嘅分佈啊、新嘅病種咧，先正式就run嗰個數據出嚟。咁到時咧就會解解畀大家聽，就用呢個模型係用乜嘢嘅假設性，將來係需要幾多醫生嗰個。

276
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:25,540
下一步會做，所以現時嚟講咧係冇數字嘅，暫時。一陣間，一陣間我再同你跟嗰個問題。一係規矩兩分鐘啦，嚇。

277
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,710
O.K.打一萬毫子。

278
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:39,570
好，OK，Dr. Johnson，I would like to ask you a question concerning the four separate approaches contained in number twelve of the slide.

279
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:46,220
of the powerpoint, okay, the four separate approaches. Now, um.

280
00:38:46,500 --> 00:39:06,510
Now I have looked at the the factors, various factors contained in the column basis for consideration. Okay. Now all this appear to be to be highly relevant for us to formulate our policy in long term. All this are highly relevant.

281
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:19,440
For instance, but the difference between these four separate approaches is that number one, number three and number four seems to base on what we ideally want, okay.

282
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:29,360
for instance, socially optimal number, standard care and historical one and three啊，are prescriptive more or less what we want.

283
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,700
但第二和第四個似乎基於實務限制。

284
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:44,410
like number likely to employ and historical trends, all these are facts, okay, factual consideration. Now, um.

285
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,750
Can you tell me whether all these four approaches are mutually exclusive?

286
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,160
Can we combine?

287
00:39:52,830 --> 00:40:01,810
some approaches as a certain approach within another one, such that what we consider to be pertinent considerations could be included.

288
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,660
在the approach we finally adopt.

289
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,070
yes，Chairman，thank you。

290
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:19,760
You guys answer ask yes no questions. The answer is yes. The the

291
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:30,170
The needs-based model, as I said earlier, is probably the optimal model in many ways, but it

292
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,230
requires subjective data.

293
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,650
and is difficult to verify.

294
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:42,010
and for that reason, and be and because

295
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,910
not all relevant data, perhaps available in Hong Kong at this time, for this model.

296
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,820
所以， for that reason， we have set that model aside.

297
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,300
The demand model, the demand utilisation based model, which is what

298
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,630
我 presented this based on.

299
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,810
係一個更量化嘅模型。

300
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:10,250
and because it's a more quantitative model, and it draws on very verifiable data.

301
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,600
所以。

302
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,410
從你的點 of view of

303
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:24,550
Preparing policy for Hong Kong, it gives you a more secure basis for that because the data is much more quantifiable and verifiable.

304
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,460
我同意，的benchmarking和趨勢分析，是，非常有用的。

305
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,660
and will be used to cross-validate or triangulate.

306
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:50,520
The demand utilisation-based model, so we will use them, but the core projection will be done on the demand utilisation-based model and triangulated with the benchmarking and trend analysis models.

307
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,770
係先誒，我想跟住問問阿秘書長咧。咁目前依家我哋醫管局所用緊嘅。

308
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,280
即係誒，你哋而家有都又會有一啲人力嘅。

309
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:18,870
嘅嘅嘅規劃啦，係用緊一個咩嘅模式㗎？即係同依家誒，正物多啦，張Sir講得好清楚啦。主要將來睇就係demand utilisation，當然要睇埋其他嘅benchmark啊等等嘅嘢。依家我哋用緊嘅同將來所建議嘅有冇咩差別啊？

310
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,090
如果有，係點樣解釋啊？誒，主席。

311
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,990
perhaps I mean Dr Johnson, I believe you are in a better position.

312
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,920
to assess whether the HAC model

313
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:42,880
Feed in any one of the four because I think they have their own modified demand utilization based model essentially. It's a modification of the demand utilization based model.

314
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,280
Our models are actually very similar.

315
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,590
I see.

316
00:42:47,570 --> 00:43:07,580
就或者主席，我補充一下咧，就即係誒阿何議員提到一個好好誒誒好重要一點咧，就係話點解我哋都用咗唔耐時間咧，就係話喺特別喺醫生嗰個誒預測方面咧，除咗我哋嘅目的係整個香港嘅需求，但係醫管局咧佢係佔咗好大部分，咁而佢一直咧亦都做緊一啲。

317
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:27,590
預測噉，所以我哋亦都確保我哋將來呢一個model咧，係同佢嗰個咧係接合得到。咁或者答何議員咧，我嘅理解咧，佢醫管局做咧，佢而家係一個所所謂modify demand，佢一個demand即係需求得嚟咧，佢係由各自有一個由低層嗰度嚇每一個department一個customer。

318
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:42,620
唔係每一個誒誒誒誒service嗰度，佢哋基本仲跟住自己嘅需求去估計，咁完之後一路咁加上去嚇，咁所以咧佢係一個類似demand得嚟咧，係有就係佢根據就自己嗰個需求改變咗少少嘅。

319
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,070
嗯。

320
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,870
跟住係李國宏。

321
00:43:48,920 --> 00:44:08,930
誒，多謝主席。主席，我睇到嗰個即係誒香港大學做出嚟呢個即係預測嘅一個模式咧，就係幫到政府希望佢可以即係準確預測得到咧，即係到底誒，係咪對啊？中香港大學冇錯。

322
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,750
即係誒嚟緊呢三五十年啊，要幾多人？

323
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:25,810
誒呢個model，我真係當然啦，我就誒尊重啊學者做出嚟嗰個把尺，就係噉樣啦。噉佢個依依依係一個誒一一個方法啦嚇，一個方法，我咪做咗呢樣嘢。

324
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:46,370
誒，我幾個問題所問嘅就係誒，我哋而家好似係話何議員講緊現時一啲醫院管理嗰個計法，佢話有嘅咁做出嚟咁噉，但係坊間有啲唔同嘅計法，我就醫生我唔識㗎，即係護士我就識嘅嚇噉啊。如果我用翻即係我明白嘅呢個係一個方法。

325
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:46,850
係。

326
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,090
咁如果我用翻一啲，

327
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,320
好似呢張。

328
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:11,680
即係頭影片裏邊講嗰幾個唔同嘅一啲方法去做，噉我想問下，我假設用一個叫做benchmarking嘅呢一個中文我唔知叫咩嚇，噉嘅方法去做，入咗啲數據出嚟之後，或者係叫做誒need space嘅方法入去做，你出嚟嗰個。

329
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:22,100
數字，咁同而家我哋坊間講到有一把尺，國際都公認嘅一個護士喺急性病房去照顧六個病人。

330
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:35,510
噉嘅方法，你係會係咪一樣咧？出嚟嗰啲需要嗰啲，第日要三五十年嗰啲護士嘅數字，呢個第一點。第二點就係喺呢一把尺，即係呢一個方法去計嚇，即係。

331
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:42,330
呢個叫做即係誒conceptual design model for whatever health professionals。

332
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,740
誒係咪淨係計緊？

333
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:52,630
最衰level即係第三層醫院服務嘅咧，又可唔可以計埋第二層同埋？

334
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,030
基層嘅咧。

335
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,540
係，一秘書長。

336
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:15,980
係誒，主席就正如頭先啊啊啊，李員都提到咧，就係話，如果你用一個benchmarking嘅時候咧，你就根據一個國際上或者係大家認同，即係或者自己認為較合理嘅。咁所以呢個係比較即係英文叫subjective啲，即係話你主觀性就係話，我認為乜嘢個數個個個ratio個數字係。

337
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:35,990
合理嘅噉，然之後用嗰個噉就即係第一就話會有唔同嘅爭拗嚇。第二咧，亦都係嗰個資源係咪合理嘅問題。第三就係話你嗰個環境，即係你醫院環境係度度地方都唔同噉啊噉。咁所以因為考慮到呢啲嘅時候咧，咁所以佢香港大學咧，即係誒，I mean，correct me if I'm wrong，I didn't get the message。

338
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:56,000
yeah, what I'm what I'm saying that is honourably is referring to the projection for nurses, not doctors, nurses. Yes, I understand. He just take the example that if we use the benchmarking, that that means you have to pick a ratio, and then based on the ratio you can assess the long-term demand. Yes. I just explain that the the problem with benchmarking

339
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:16,010
It's very subjective in picking a ratio, because then it will be a lot of argument and disagreement, etc., etc., etc. And also, you got to take into account the local situation, the hospital setting, because different places or different setting, the ratio may not be that appropriate. So I'm just saying that for this reason, the Hong Kong University.

340
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:36,140
是 helping us to make reference to all these the sort of different approaches to models, and then try to find a way that best suit the Hong Kong situation. Yes. So that is the the the the whole purpose of having this independent study for us. Yes. And then the second.

341
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:56,150
個question ask by honour Lee is that whether the projection will capture the primary and secondary care? Because and then I mean I just at that point trying to touch on that. I believe that we will do that, just like doctor. I mean we're not we're not just focusing on the hospital authority doctors, but the whole Hong Kong, including

342
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:09,310
including private practitioner, family doctors, so there's a primary and secondary. The same will apply to other, this particular in respect of nurses, because one of the key pressure point from the

343
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:27,240
ageing population would be the demand for nurses not only in hospital but also in elderly homes and even at individual private homes because in future there might be more individual who are able to afford having their own nurses taking care of them when they go old.

344
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,000
我冇時間咯。

345
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:51,290
冇，係轉頭再第二輪。啊，陳建波議員，誒，多謝主席，因為我趕住去開第二個會啊。咁但係我想問咧，嗱，我啲技術性我真係冇乜大熱點，因為我真係唔係好識去comment。但係我相信誒，香港大學都有佢一套即係認可嘅方法去做啦。我反而想問啊，秘書長啊，就係講咧，嗱，政府都只識講啦嚇，我哋一定。

346
00:48:51,290 --> 00:49:11,300
確保有人手醫護人手充足嘅供應咧，咁但係我哋無論你用咩方法咧，其實你都就算你用土法去計咧，你都知道我一定係不不足嘅。同埋香港大學嗰個其實係到二零一四年下半年先至完成嘅研究。咁大家知道培養一個醫生啊、護士啊，其實係需要好長嘅時間。咁譬如舉例。

347
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:31,310
生都讀六年啦，係嘛？咁變咗，其實當局已經有曬啲人口推算啊，預計有幾多大學生畢業咁關數字咧？其實就算係即係你用即係，就算冇呢個研究，你都好容易推算咧。我哋個醫療規劃咧，其實係需要好多人。噉我想問一問政府咧，你誒會點樣落實去做一個短中期嘅措施咧？就

348
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:51,320
可以令到香港係有足夠嘅誒醫生去誒維持香港醫護人手咧。噉我自己覺得咧，就嗰個誒睇門診咧，似乎冇問題。好似阿梁家豪醫生都有講咧，其實好多醫生都有有有即係有資源或有有時間可以再做，但係喺私家醫院做手術嗰啲，似乎真係有啲問題。噉你？

349
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:58,950
我想問政府咧喺個短中期措施，你有咩措施確保香港有足夠嘅誒醫療人手去供應個市場咧？

350
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:19,520
係啊，秘書長。就主席就我諗啊，陳議員集中就係誒，首先就係醫生先咧。就正如阿議員講咧，就係話呢個model咧做起出嚟嘅時候咧，佢個projection即係個預測咧，都係講緊嚟緊五六五年啊、十年或者甚至長再長遠啲。佢目的就方便，亦都能夠請我哋咧較為準確啲去。

351
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:39,530
預測將來嘅需求，從而咧就係早作即係準備。咁但係咧就誒喺醫生特別係醫生嘅時候咧，佢嗰個需要訓練出嚟嘅時間係好長嘅。咁但係大家都明白，亦都接受現時咧誒，我哋已經係即係唔唔足夠醫生。咁所以中短期嘅時候咧，我哋都唔係等到呢。

352
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:59,540
呢個model呢個model係長遠幫我哋嘅。短期嘅時候，我諗近期你聽到我哋講就係，譬如舊年係一二三年咧，已經喺兩間大學嘅醫學院咧，總共多咗一百個醫學生嘅，由四由三百二去到四百二十嘅，已經多咗嘅。咁而另一方面咧，誒最近應該大概幾個禮拜前咧，就誒。

353
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:19,550
Medical Council就香港醫醫委會咧，亦都宣佈咗佢會增多一次考試，一年考兩次試，就方便更多誒嘅醫科學生喺外國讀書嘅醫科翻翻嚟誒考試嘅。咁所以呢啲已經係一啲係誒中中短期嘅，就多一次考試嗰個短期啦嚇，多一百。

354
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:35,880
個學生應該算係中期咧，咁長期咧就係等我定咗做咗出嚟個嗰個規劃之後咧，就再睇睇有咩特別可以做到啦。譬如係咪仲要再增加學位咧？噉就算增加學位咧，都唔係短時間可以做到，亦都要等兩間大學佢有冇噉嘅能力係訓練同埋加大個學位。

355
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:36,820
謝謝。

356
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,370
食夠啦嘛！你仲要廿八、三廿八秒。

357
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:45,570
我要我要開IAC啊！你知啦，保險諮詢委員會，唔好意思。

358
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:53,210
嗱，噉我想跟進翻頭先啊方光遠問嗰個問題，個抗訴等等，因為呢啲呢啲模型咧。

359
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:00,280
即係佢係咪可靠？乜唔得咧？我哋要不斷咁fit啲數據入去試下㗎嘛嚇。

360
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,400
噉，譬如我睇你呢一個圖嗰度咧，其實我睇唔到你喺邊一度。

361
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:16,660
唔好話我睇唔到，我估我可以fit啲地方入去，但係我係想問啊，秘書長，你喺邊度fit？即係將嗰個誒診證時間嗰樣放入呢個模型入邊考慮。

362
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,760
嗱，應該嚟講。

363
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:34,400
係有一個位你列咗出嚟嘅喎，嚇嗱，譬如你話頭先阿方源問嗰個，譬如人口老化啊，噉你就係嗰個誒H sex group咁嗰度嚇，噉你嗰個H sex group，若果你個年口大嗰個group開始多咗。

364
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,840
嚇，咁咪反映咗人口老化嗰個問題咯。咁但係consultation time嗰樣咧？

365
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,940
即係我係想測試下呢個模型。

366
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,240
Yeah.

367
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,130
啊，主席，啊，我哋。

368
00:52:48,910 --> 00:53:08,920
Can I? You win. Yes. Can can you help to answer this question? I can help. I mean, you know, because I think there's a very simplified presentation of the model, so there might there might be some certain widgets where you can input the consultation time belongs to the supply side of the equation.

369
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,460
not to the demand side of the equation. The demand side of the equation it looks at the

370
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:30,040
The demand coming from the patient side, right? The the healthcare need side, okay. And the consultation time belongs to the supply side of the equation. That's why I said we would, if we're going to model

371
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:40,560
FDE requirements related to by consultation time, then we would add it to the supply side. We would factor that in to the supply side of the equation.

372
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,480
因為那會增加，the the supply requirement。

373
00:53:47,240 --> 00:54:07,250
秘書長可唔可以解釋下點解會係consultation time會係個supply size個factor，唔係個demand size個factor？我作為主席，即係我諗，即係你我啱啱你講得啱，即係兩邊你都可以嘅。譬如你話你佢喺嗰個誒，譬如佢supply size意思就係話佢而家一個assumption嚇，就係話誒一個醫。

374
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:27,260
生啊，譬如佢一日個工作時間，佢可以睇幾多個病人嚇咁呢度噉啊。咁如果你轉咗個consulting time咧，噉你每日睇嘅病人可能係由每日嘅十個啊二十個病人嚇變成係十五個病人啊。咁呢個就係嗰個即係supply size啦。變咗每個醫生咧，佢只能夠睇十五個病。

375
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:47,270
就咁解，所以我諗啊，Doctor Johnson佢意思咧就係話用個supply-side model意思就話，即係佢可以，即係佢而家呢個咧，佢入邊好多好籠統嘅啫。譬如佢話嗰個workforce participation rate咁先算，佢入邊即係講幾個factor喺度咧。你咁即係我估係唔係一個exhaustive嘅誒assumption factor嚟嘅？佢應該嗰度咧就係話。

376
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:52,590
一個醫生嘅工作時間，一個一個星期幾耐嚇，每日幾耐時間啊，等等噉。

377
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,110
啦。

378
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,400
對翻呢兩幅圖去睇。

379
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:04,740
你譬如呢個operation嗰度咧，你中間嗰個surface utilisation嗰度咧，你有一個total number of visit。

380
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,700
嚇，咁嗰個咧？

381
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:14,950
你就因應個人口結構啊，各咗各樣咧，你就估算到有幾多個求診人次。

382
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,690
係咪？

383
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:24,270
噉你求診人次嗰度，你一就conversion to full time employee，full time employee係咪？

384
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,830
啊！就係喺嗰個conversion中間，就係你每個求診人次。

385
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,940
你用個時間長啲。

386
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,260
佢個full-time employee嗰個隻數目就大啲啦。

387
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,000
咁應該就喺嗰度攝入去嘅。

388
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:49,580
嚇！咁但係呢幅圖都冇嘅，你都冇冇話點攝入去嘅？你嗱，譬如你一個supply model嗰度，你個supply model主要就係計算。

389
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:57,150
你會培訓，即係誒喺個供應嗰方面嗰個供應嗰啲人手嚇，噉你嗰個就係。

390
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:17,760
嗰個唔係同嗰個consultation產品而下邊係無關嘅supply model就係話你依家有幾多人啦，有幾多醫生啊，新增有幾多醫生啦，有幾多非本地醫生啦，咁同埋會唔會有啲退咗休嘅醫生啊，或者誒啲誒男醫生去做工作時間長啲，女醫生工作

391
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,650
時間就短啲啊！咁嗰度你就係講下邊嗰度就係你計誒有幾多醫生培訓到出嚟啊？

392
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:42,100
嗰個就叫supply size嘛，但係consultation三嗰度係個病人個需求嗰度係個病人嘅demand，嗰個係個demand size嘅factor嚟㗎嘛，噉就應該喺個total number of visit同埋個conversion to full time employee嗰啲，你嗰度嗰度考慮咁攝入去㗎嘛。

393
00:56:43,450 --> 00:57:03,460
係咪啊？嗱，我我依家就係話測試你個模型，就係你提即係我哋諗到嘅一影響嗰個人力需求嗰個因素，demand需求人影響人力需求嘅因素就係人口老化啦，同埋嗰個社會個期望高咗，即係譬如佢希望見個醫生時間耐啲啦，咁嗰個係demand。

394
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,040
size嘅data嚟㗎嘛。

395
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:14,240
嚇！噉我要測試你個模型whether唔whether，我就要我哋諗到個所有嘅因素咧，就要畀我睇，畀我哋睇到喺度fit到入去先得㗎嘛，係咪？

396
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,350
嗯。

397
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,330
你會唔會往後啲日子？

398
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,170
即係可以。

399
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,310
財哥有有員委有委員要提問，唔該舉手啊！若果唔係我，我大把嘢問啊！

400
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,630
往後嘅日子，我哋仲有冇機會去？

401
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,560
睇一個再誒。

402
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,010
你嗰個computer model係點嘅樣？因為嗱，computer model嗰啲都係。

403
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,240
係個人。

404
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:50,600
已經諗曬點樣做先至教個電腦做嚇，new network嗰啲嘢其實唔係咁複雜，我都識玩唔。

405
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,560
好易玩嘅啫。

406
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:58,450
嚇！我要知道每一個factor邊度fit入去，咁咁大家先有得。

407
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:07,980
即係參場下啊嘛，好嘛？噉你或者誒轉頭，我睇下遲啲我作一陣間個會議打後，我睇下咩時候你可以再翻嚟。

408
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,840
講一講咯，阿方剛完第二輪啦。

409
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:20,530
唔該，主席，我覺得我覺得呢個model其實係即係好難整得好準嘅，即係只不過做個framework嘅啫，我認為，OK。

410
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:32,290
噉啊！譬如講呢個，你頭先啊，譬如像你講嗰個醫生嗰度，啊，大學係增加咗好多醫生，噉佢又去到由三百幾個變咗四百幾嘅畢業生。

411
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:39,410
咁但係你知道一個好有經驗嘅醫生，如果佢係要退休？

412
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,300
佢呢個有經驗醫生退休咧？

413
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:57,400
其實你要揾幾多個醫生去補翻佢呢個有經驗嘅醫生個效能咧？咁咁呢一方面呢個呢個電腦入邊有冇有冇呢樣嘢計數先？即係你起碼都要計一計。

414
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:10,170
即係起碼你有個assumption喺度啊，一個誒consultant退休係要我要補充五個新嘅醫生係先至做得翻佢。即係起碼你有個噉樣嘅諗法啦。我認為。

415
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,000
仲有有。

416
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,180
嗰條test你嘅model到底準唔準咧？

417
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,260
噉我唔好講將來嘅嘢，我淨係講今日嘅嘢。

418
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:41,550
即係如果攞所有今日嘅數字飛曬入去，你起碼你個電腦要擠出嚟嗰個醫生缺嗰個number咧，要同你哋而家政府心心目中諗住我而家爭，譬如我而家爭誒四百個醫生嘅，噉我起碼而家今日嘅數字接入去你個model電腦嘅。

419
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:57,710
出到嚟係咪四百個咧？咁如果係噉，起碼話啊呢個都準啦。咁咁起碼今日嘅嘢我要準啦，過後嘅啲嘢就比較難啲。噉啊，完全係睇你剔嗰個咩assumption就擺落去嘅啫。

420
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:18,730
係咪係咪噉嘅樣啊？秘書長係秘書長唔該，主席或者我先答第二個問題咧，就係簡單答係。所以點解就話而家咧係接近嘅一個模型，接近完之後咧，其中最主要就測試，就係阿方員講得啱啦，就係話我用翻啲過往嘅數據或者而家嘅數據，睇下佢出嚟嘅時候同我哋感覺。

421
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:38,740
常缺嘅數字係咪？係咪咁上下先係咪？就我抱評話：我哋喂，而家周圍都講緊話唔夠醫生。佢出嚟嘅時候，發覺原來我哋係O.K.嘅咁噉啊，出咗係問題啊嘛。噉你做咗呢一步嘅時候咧，你講啱就係話呢個模型最早期嘅時候咧係一個framework噉，因為定咗之後咧，噉我哋每年話將來定時，譬如一年或者兩年度咧就不斷。

422
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:58,750
要根據實際個情況同埋佢預測出嚟個數字，過往有數數字就不斷係refine佢噉，就希望長遠咧係會有一個係可靠啲嘅模型。因為你喺醫生嘅人手咧，就算你即刻做到出嚟，我明年爭五五十個，後年爭二百個嘅時候咧，你好短時間係做唔切嘅。

423
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:18,760
係唔可能係有任何嘅政策可以改變得到佢。但係我哋最緊要根據現實經驗咧，就係話預早睇定未來十年、十五、二十年之後呢個模型咧，係最主要係幫我哋睇長遠嘅短期咧，就係頭先我答阿陳議員嗰個，就係話我哋比嚟就係舊年開始已經增加咗大學醫學生嘅數字。

424
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:38,770
增加咗百個，由三百二十去到四百二十先。我哋都唔諗唔等個模型出嚟，係爭幾多，已經先做咗。點解唔再增加多啲咧？亦都要考慮實際上兩間大學，佢冇噉嘅能力，咁短時間擴充咁多咧。咁第二個咧就更加短期做咧，就係話誒佢誒誒醫務委員會咧已經喺打算咧係。

425
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:58,780
嚟緊嘅一年咧，開始咧就每年多一次，即係非本地醫生執業嘅考試，係方便喺外國讀醫翻嚟嘅醫生咧去考試。希望噉樣咧可以鼓勵同埋吸引多一啲外地嘅醫生翻嚟。呢個亦都係唔等嗰個模型嘅。噉我模型完咗之後咧，我哋就睇睇啦。十年之後，十五年。

426
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:09,980
之後係爭幾多個醫生，咁變咗嗰陣時咧，我哋就可能再長遠睇睇，譬如大學生裏面真係要擴充嘅時候，比較足夠嘅時間去咁做嚇。咁第二咧，至於嗰個。

427
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:16,790
無形能夠預測得到佢短缺嘅醫生嗰個廉資個問題咧，就或者我睇睇啊！

428
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:37,400
Dr. Johnson， can you take the question on whether your model can predict the shortage of doctor in terms of experience as well, not only the numerical figure but also the experience？但係咧，before you answer， let me just finish my my piece。就係話，就算佢個模型能夠做到，就話我哋將來爭啊，可能係幾多個醫生係有。

429
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,020
十年、十五年咧嘅經驗嘅話咧，你個現實情況之下咧，你都唔可以即刻。

430
01:02:43,300 --> 01:03:03,310
可有咩可以做到啊？因為我達訓練出嚟，唔可以一訓練出到就個十年嘅經驗嘅醫生咁嘛。但係我哋可以用其他方法，譬如盡量頭先考試嘅方法等等咧，吸引一啲外邊嘅醫生翻嚟。咁所以最主要第一樣做咧，就話起碼同個數字嗰度做過先。咁完之後，下一步咧就再睇睇係即係有經驗嘅。

431
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:07,630
醫生係點樣可以確保即係能夠補充一番咧？噉樣樣。

432
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:17,610
主席，我知我時間冇多，就十三秒多㗎啦。O.K.嗰個我我諗最緊要做一個factor咧，我認為好影響呢個model咧。

433
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:26,550
就你覺得將來或者呢五年或者將來個十年，公私型醫生嘅合作成成效有幾多先？

434
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:30,480
即係如果成功嘅，當然就好好快啦。

435
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,170
就主席好簡單答咧，就係話我哋即係你。

436
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:54,460
講開公私營嘅時候咧，都要睇翻現時嘅實際情況。就係現時喺香港嚟講咧，九成喺公立，一成喺私家醫院嘅。噉就算我哋做咩都好咧，你唔可以將個數字突然之間改變，變成七三嚇。因為而家我哋咧公立醫院有二萬幾張牀，私家醫院咧有四千張牀。

437
01:03:54,460 --> 01:04:14,470
噉你任何改變咧，你要增加牀位。如果你要將私家醫院嘅數字加大一倍，譬如由八由十個percent去到二十percent，而公營落到八十percent咧，你已經講緊要多四千張牀嘅。咁所以咧，無論我哋做乜嘢咧，你都唔可能期望係好短時間之內有個好大嘅。

438
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:34,480
比重嘅改變，但係如果我哋唔做任何嘢咧，個數字真係永遠都唔喐咁解噉，所以咧，我哋一方面咧就係話嗰個誒醫醫保計劃就希望鼓勵一啲有能力嘅人，並唔係咁有能力嘅人，佢買咗醫療保險嘅時候咧，佢可以選擇呢個選擇，因為咧我哋唔同美國喺香港嚟講咧，你永遠都可以。

439
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:54,490
翻翻去醫管局嘅嚇噉，但係如果你買咗保險咧，一啲較為輕啲嘅病情，你想住到舒服啲，你想揀醫生，你可以出去。但係我哋同時間亦都要確保私家醫院足夠嘅牀位供應，現時咧四千張已經唔夠噉，所以嚟緊幾年咧，我哋鼓勵私家醫院擴建嘅同時咧，估計嚟緊五六年度咧應該多起碼。

440
01:04:54,490 --> 01:05:14,500
接病就二千張牀，即係差唔多由四千張牀去到六千張牀。但係因為你噉嘅所謂constraint限制咗喺度咧，公私營嘅比例咧係不可能大變，唔可能突然間變咗五十五十係無可能嘅事，現實係唔可能。你只會可能係由十同九十去到可能十二十三對八啊六八啊七。

441
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:24,060
但喺實際數字咧，會係好大嘅數字，亦都起碼係幫輕咗，即係一下。呢個係我哋即係現時嗰個構思，主席。O.K.第一輪提問啊，國家奇緣。

442
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,610
誒，阿主席。

443
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:34,380
即係我我諗有兩樣嘢，我係同意秘書長講嘅。第一咧就係呢一啲嘅模型咧，即係包括你呢個好學術性嘅模型咧。

444
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:47,710
係好難可以回應到實際嘅需要，因為我頭先我聽你講兩樣嘢，我覺得都係好難令我覺得係你呢個舉例，即係或者你嗰個估計係做得到。第一，你話嗰個。

445
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:53,070
誒公司型啊，或者保險嗰度，即係我我想再重申咧，即係再。

446
01:05:53,350 --> 01:06:02,820
誒，無論係有使或者逼啲市民去尋求保險或者私人醫療去解決長遠香港醫療嘅問題咧。

447
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:23,110
我係好大嘅保留嘅，我覺得公帑都係應該用翻喺公共醫療嗰度。即係對於你話政府點樣去補貼去買私家保險嗰啲，或者係仲要吸引多啲人買保險咧，我係好大嘅保留。即係從而話點樣可以做做個公私營嗰度。第二咧就係呢個係誒永遠。

448
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:39,230
都係滯後嘅，不過就係滯後嗰樣方法咧，就好難去解決。大家都記得當年咧，即係講翻噉啊，楊醫生喺度，仲記得當年咧就係唔夠請唔到，冇錢請唔起醫生，於是乎就停咗醫學生。

449
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:59,890
噉啊！而家就再加醫醫生、醫學生，但係咧，可能到啲醫學生出嚟嘅時候咧，個環境又轉咗嘅，即係分分鐘咧就係嗰個時候誒要離開醫管局嗰啲，而家走到雞飛狗走嘅，大家都知道，即係啲誒資深或者中層嗰啲都。

450
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:19,900
但係始終咧，正如你講，因為私人醫療咧，佢只係可以吸納到百分之十度嘅啫，所以佢到某個點咧，佢就飽和，佢唔不可能嘅。即係我舉個例，婦產科已經冇人離開嘅啦，即係因為嗰個雙飛政策一截咗龍咧，冇乜再有新嘅婦產科醫生咧係離開公營。

451
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:39,910
系統嘅噉，所以咧，即係呢一啲，你係永遠解決唔到嘅。我想問咧，就係話你喺你嗰個模型入邊咧，有啲咩方法係能夠短期可以轉到身嘅？即係話咧，你係將點樣將呢一啲誒？我哋頭先睇到嘅一啲，譬如話。

452
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,710
誒公立醫院入邊，佢係好難去。

453
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:52,930
留到人嘅一啲嘅情況，而家好多人離開公立醫院咧，就唔係純粹因為佢個收入嘅問題，好多係因為喺醫管局入邊咧，佢覺得係。

454
01:07:53,390 --> 01:08:13,400
佢係完全覺得冇一個誒一個滿足感，佢睇唔到將來。好多人離開係噉樣，呢個係個事實嚟嘅。你係再訓練多幾多人咧？係誒頭先啱啱開會嗰陣時，可能你唔喺度，你唔知我話嚇誒，我哋定兩分鐘就淨係計你發言。

455
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:31,820
嘅時間，政府答嘅時間就唔計，所以你冇需要發表咁多意見嘅。好好發表意見，其他得噉。我我我先問一問佢，嚇即係我再問埋佢，就係話點樣可以確保即係你同醫管局你哋嗰個政策，即係一個人事管理嘅政策，能夠反映到喺你呢個模型入邊。

456
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:53,270
誒，秘書長，首先或者我先答答，就係話嗰個滯後嘅問題咧，就係話頭先啊，郭建都提到，就係喺二零零三年嘅時候咧，因為經濟問題突然之間咧，就變咗初出嚟嘅醫科學生咧，係政府唔請嘅。咁呢個大家都明白係一個當時一個極大嘅錯誤嘅決定。咁所以而家我做呢個model，亦都希望可以幫翻到將來唔會有。

457
01:08:53,270 --> 01:09:13,280
同重鋪覆設，因為點解咧？就話當時嚟講係唔知道將來長遠需要幾多醫生，咁變咗你當時嚟講話哦過多，我請唔起就唔請啦噉。我哋希望做咗呢個model咧，頭先講咧係長遠，佢唔會係predict到明年幾多，因為做唔到嘢嘅。譬如我係睇個model，長遠嚟講係估計到五年十年，我需要係香港咁多醫生，但係喺中間過。

458
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:33,290
突然間，因為經濟問題，佢嗰年可能醫管真係話唔夠錢噉，但係咧變咗係我哋又有有噉嘅能力，醫管局咧就同政府講翻啦，就係話唔可以咁短視。你嗰班西醫科醫生咧，你要炒佢唔請佢，因為點解咧？我哋預測咧，長遠五年、十年之後咧係有咁多醫生喺度嘅。咁因為噉嘅時候咧係一個。

459
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:53,300
責任確保我哋有足夠嘅醫生，咁所以呢個model將來咧就起碼幫到呢樣就唔會再係噉，因為當時嚟講係冇得講。噉你點解仲醫生咧？你點解將來仲有咩噉啊？嘛，咁所以咧，即係呢個model咧係最緊係係講中長，特別係長期，亦都係令到我哋咧確保穩定，唔會受短期嘅衝擊。變咗到時可能嘅情況就係話，就算冇。

460
01:09:53,300 --> 01:10:13,310
冇錢都好咧，因為長遠要保住呢班醫生，變咗我哋需要短期，我跑嚟要擺嗰度啦，優先要排喺嗰度，即係呢個係去幫到嘅。第二就係話你講嘅問題咧，就坦白講咁無形就幫唔到啊，就係話醫管局嘅醫生個士氣係點樣挽留佢？但係佢哋，你知道我哋最近而家係做緊一個醫管局嘅檢討而。

461
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:33,320
要檢討入邊最其中嘅最主要要睇嘅咧，就係呢樣嘢，包括就係資源分配啊、醫生嗰個工作環境啊、佢哋嘅士氣啊、點樣留挽留人才啊、加強培訓啊，令到佢有一個滿足感。因為點講都，香港而家醫生一半，如果我哋講係active service咧，可能。

462
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:53,330
超過一半咧係喺公營系統喺入邊啊！呢個永遠都係我哋基石。頭先我回覆翻你回回應翻你頭先講就係話，我哋並唔係想話鼓勵啲人啊，將啲人趕出去誒誒誒私營醫療保險等等。因為頭先我答啊，方議員都解咗，就係話我係想咁做咧，現實都唔得嘅，因為實際上限制於就係。

463
01:10:53,330 --> 01:11:13,340
私家醫院個，但係我哋睇到就係話香港嘅特殊性咧，就係話我哋公司型都做得咁好，市民佢有個權去選擇。咁同埋而家買咗保險嘅人嚇，我哋有個責任就確保佢係陳志遠喺度，就係話佢買咗喺個very誒for money，係一個即係係有真正可以。

464
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:33,350
用到嘅醫療保險變咗，將來嘅市民咧，佢有個選擇，所以個empowerment就留翻個市民去決定你肯承擔幾多，就唔係好似譬如美國噉，就係話政府話明醫療保醫療咧就係所有市民你自己要承擔曬所有責任，所以逼你全部人要買曬醫療保險。我哋就唔係，我哋長遠係有個問題。

465
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:53,590
人口老化，需求好大，但係咧，我哋希望將呢個決定自己你肯承擔幾多咧，畀翻個市民。如果我係有噉嘅能力嘅，我定買定一個醫療保險。到我有病嘅時候咧，我自己決定，我可以去嚟公營係啊，就得；去私營有得。如果我去私營嘅，我咪承擔翻部分咯。但係完全係零。

466
01:11:53,590 --> 01:12:13,600
你自己選擇，政府唔會逼你，唔會食，亦都唔會啊用任何手段係逼你出去供人係噉。只不過我哋都見到而家起碼有十分之一人佢係用緊買咗保險，用緊醫療私人醫療嘅點解唔諗辦法，令到佢真正係能夠物有所用？就呢個我主要嗰個構思。

467
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:19,010
啊，阿秘書長，呢一個時間問題。而家我想問一個好簡單嘅問題。

468
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:24,530
誒嗱，我睇你呢個model啦，Doctor Johnson，你就冇分到公私型嘅。

469
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,280
啱啊嘛，係啊，OK嗱。

470
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:37,810
依家眼前咧有一個好大嘅問題咧，就係嗰個公司人嘅分配有問題。若果根據翻你呢個model，你淨係total lump up discharge或者back days咁講。

471
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:43,750
去除翻個醫術醫生數目咧，若果你將公營同私營計埋一齊計嘅話咧，

472
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,000
眼前已經人手過剩。

473
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:54,410
因為你你計你自己都知道喺你專科醫生嚟講就係誒公營私營嘅每樣一半。

474
01:12:54,850 --> 01:13:14,860
但係嗰個誒醫院服務咧，就公營佔咗八十五個percent至九十嚇。咁所以引致就係醫管局嗰個人手就好不足，相對而言啦，同埋嗰個輪候時間好長。咁若果你公司人一齊計咧，你一撈埋計嘅話，你就噉你呢個模型咧，我睇到咧你。

475
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:22,780
冇去考慮到嗰個不均勻嘅分配嘅問題，咁所以若果你一咁加埋公僕人一計咧，眼前已經係即刻人手過剩。

476
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:31,400
因為你將私，你將嗰個私營嗰度嗰個，你依一個係九一嘅比例嚟嘅。

477
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:52,410
或者主席啊，當啊，簡簡簡短答一答啦，因為我想剩翻都起碼九個字，等一，因為答半冇得extend嘅，原來佢阿秘書話畀我知，跟住又會開，噉我都想剩翻九個字畀阿楊教授講講。或者我上次好簡單答噉，如果當個分配問題點制話，嗰個模型點處理？因為我哋講緊。

478
01:13:52,410 --> 01:14:12,420
係九一嘅時候咧，係講緊特殊service，因為香港嘅特殊環境之下咧，所有基本上primary care咧，即係門診咧，係由私家醫生誒提供嘅。咁所以咧，就譬如我哋講緊嗰五千五五千幾個醫生喺公入係公入醫院啦，另外五千幾個係私家醫生私營啦，但係五千幾個私營入邊咧。

479
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:32,430
好大部分咧，佢係提供係即門診嘅，咁所以佢嚟講咧就唔係可以咁直接即誒比對得到啊。唔同啦，你有anything to supplement Dr Johnson terms of the誒distribution capacity distribution between the public and private sector and the un the quote under

480
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:36,210
utilisation of the private doctors in the market.

481
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:47,090
我係講因為，因為大多數的私人醫生，佢哋係提供 primary care。係啊，所以如果比較，你要比較，係專科醫生同醫院管理局醫生。

482
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:58,620
In terms of the utilisation, they're not compared. They are individually projected, so they're independently projected and then brought together at the end. So the

483
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:05,700
The projections are for each sector, public and private, and for each setting.

484
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:11,790
出patient或inpatient或作為Professor Joseph。

485
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:19,570
sorry, Lee said it includes other sectors as relevant to perhaps nursing.

486
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:39,860
And they're independently projected嗱誒，我其實都仲諗到好多問題嘅。不過即係都因為嗰個議程關係，即係我都想阿楊教授講一講咁人力嗰度咧誒，一陣間誒臨尾嗰陣想同你講講，或者會另外一個section要再即係就話淨係就阿Doctor Johnson嚟解釋啊，好。

487
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,060
話嚇，人哋嗰度就。

488
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:48,720
遲啲有需要，另外一個會議再講。咁或者依家亦都可以去誒。

489
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,520
楊教授講埋嗰個專業規管嗰度好嗎？

490
01:15:54,170 --> 01:16:00,050
因為因為好難約到兩個教授一齊嚟嘅，嚇噉，所以我亦都想誒。

491
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:10,280
即係即使人力嗰方面大家都仲可能仲有問題嘅話，都誒日後再處理嚇。咁依家我哋去以前嘅第四項就係嗰個。

492
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,360
誒。

493
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:17,600
專業規管架構嗰方面嚇，咁頭先啊，秘書長都嗰個。

494
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:22,420
誒介紹嗰度啲已經講咗㗎啦，係嘛？咁依家請阿楊教授講佢嗰個。

495
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,490
力規管嗰個。

496
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:33,000
研究係點樣咯？好嘛？O K，誒多謝主席。誒，奧然英文誒簡介我哋嗰個報告啊，跟住又係用分誒中文誒。

497
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,990
誒，即係。

498
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:38,530
即係答誒議員嘅問題。

499
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:45,110
Our task in the Chinese University to review the professional regulatory framework for healthcare professionals.

500
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:59,790
The four objectives: one is to look at experiences outside Hong Kong; the second is to look our current system in in Hong Kong in the different professions; the third is to analyse similarities and differences.

501
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:04,220
and identify areas that require attention and highlight emerging challenges.

502
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:17,570
The study areas are seven. We're looking at legislation, regulatory and supervisory structures, undergraduate training, registration and licensing processes, accreditation systems.

503
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:29,720
機制 for upholding professional standards and continuing competence, and mechanisms for detecting and dealing with professional misconduct and poor performance, and looking at overseas graduates.

504
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:41,780
study design is in two phases. We finished the first phase, which is review international models, looking at Hong Kong's review, and then making recommendations.

505
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,460
誒。

506
01:17:45,160 --> 01:18:02,530
The main data collection methods for two. One is to look at policy papers and review papers, authoritative monographs, and information provided by regulatory bodies internationally, and then doing international visits and interviews of regulators and experts in other countries.

507
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:15,060
The review of the international literature showed that the main purpose of professional regulation is threefold. One is provide ensure minimally acceptable standards of care.

508
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:33,940
The second is provide accountability and reassure patients that professionals are deserving of trust. The third is to provide guidance about best practice and foster improvement. So we're moving ahead, moving forwards from just looking at minimal accepted standards to look at ways to improve the quality of care.

509
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:47,930
喺啲文獻，有四個主題。一個係自薦錄取安排，因為大多數國家都有自薦錄取安排，為專業人士。

510
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:57,700
但係， vary considerably in terms of the whether it's complete sub-regulation or in partnership between professions and the public, so called co-regulation.

511
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:11,850
Regulatory bodies, we see that there's more lay involvement, and that it's the regulatory bodies are becoming more accountable, and adjudication is sometimes seen as an independent function.

512
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:21,770
在terms of quality improvements， there are attempts to look at how to improve the quality of care using certification and recertification， particularly in the U.S.

513
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:32,750
和專業ism專業ism是seen to be complementary to regulation， as it ensures patient safety and quality of care， which is not a sanction against medical error。

514
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:43,520
just range of the mechanisms for regulating health professionals. This is in the U.S., but it's got applications for other jurisdictions as well.

515
01:19:43,800 --> 01:20:03,810
licensure is the granting of legal permits to practice. Registration is a compilation of list of individuals who have satisfied an authority they are qualified to practice. So registration is usually associated with licensure, but they are separate mechanisms. Certification is acknowledgement of a pre-level, predetermined level of achievement. It's.

516
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:15,550
通常設在一個水平以上，的可接受標準。所以認證通常會看更多，而不僅僅是對於執業和註冊的要件。

517
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,280
再驗證 certification。

518
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:28,650
to ensure that practitioners maintain and collect appropriate evidence to attest to standards of their practice and demonstrate continuing competence.

519
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:49,010
Credentialing is this is particularly for private providers and payers, where systematic collection, review and verification of the professionals' professional qualifications using paper chain data, and for individuals in the particular activity. And this applies specifically for.

520
01:20:49,010 --> 01:21:06,120
some of the procedures that require surgery or invasive procedures, where people look in terms of the credentials of the practitioner in terms of how many they've done, the quality of their work, so they're then credentialed to do certain procedures or certain practices.

521
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:12,370
和 privileging is usually the grant of permission to perform specific professional activities.

522
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:31,210
We've looked at the different models in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, US, Canada, in mainland, Taiwan, New Zealand, Germany and Finland, and we've looked at some professions: doctors, nurses, dentists, Chinese medical practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals.

523
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:37,400
呃， visits that we've done to UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan.

524
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:52,380
Context is that there are many jurisdictions. This is a growing topic for discussion, and this growing network of those involved in the regulatory processes, and this rapidly changing terrain.

525
01:21:52,800 --> 01:22:04,880
There are ten key messages. One is that regulation, the reform of regulation, is seen to protect for the purpose of protecting patients and improving the quality of care.

526
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,580
立法的Changes是需要required to reform structures.

527
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:27,540
Policy and organisation for an overarching common principle of governance emerging. So, because in many jurisdictions they find that many of the professional regulations vary from profession to profession, so they see the need for there to be an overarching common principles for the regulation of all the professions.

528
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:34,920
And many and most jurisdictions are moving towards self-regulation in partnership with the public.

529
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:49,590
lay representation is is becoming the norm in many countries, and relationships with govern with governance and regulation standards by healthcare systems and institutional institutional regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

530
01:22:49,870 --> 01:23:09,880
compulsory continuing professional training and professional continuing professional development is the norm, and there's an emerging emphasis on not just to get minimal standards, but for detecting and dealing with poor performance and improving the quality of care. And in many jurisdictions, the roles

531
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:16,410
The councils it are being separated, and I'll give some examples later.

532
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,860
And overseas graduates are admitted in different ways in the different jurisdictions.

533
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,090
啊！

534
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:40,310
most of the changes are triggered by increasing public expectations for greater accountability and transparency, and often triggered by scandals and some political interests. And the main aim, as I say, is to protect patients, ensure patient safety, improve quality of care.

535
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:46,440
Some examples of reform in Australia. They now have a single national scheme for accreditation registration.

536
01:23:46,720 --> 01:24:01,260
UK has looked at has proposing methods to simplify the current complex arrangements, to remove inconsistencies of regulations in different professions. So they are proposing one legal frame for all professions.

537
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:13,460
所以這些例子有啲umbrella legislation，所以有啲nationally consistent legislation in the single act，所以佢哋有個單一單一legislation to include all the professions，所以有啲consistency。

538
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:23,990
所以這些例子， of what's happening for in Australia, New Zealand, in Canada, they already have umbrella legislation. Finland as well, UK is proposing to change.

539
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,270
嗯。

540
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:36,600
所以common so the the main main purpose is to enhance common principles of regulation and oversight of the different regulatory bodies.

541
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:56,870
There's a movement from the concept of right self-regulation and towards more co-regulation, either in partnership with the public or having government oversight, and there's a much greater emphasis on openness, accountability and engagement of lay representatives.

542
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:04,820
The types of self-regulation in Canada and Germany. There's government-sanctioned self-regulation.

543
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:12,250
In UK, Australia and New Zealand, there's co-regulation, partnership either with the government, of the public or the community.

544
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:26,200
And in jurisdictions like Singapore and Malaysia and mainland, in fact, there's very strong government oversight because in Malaysia and Singapore, the the director general of health is the registrar of the of the professional councils.

545
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:30,770
and in in China obviously the oversight is directly in the ministry.

546
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:51,850
There's global trend towards increasing more lay people in boards and review panels and inquiries. So this is just a table of some of the percentage of lay representatives. The ones that don't have any lay representatives are usually have very strong government oversight. As it in Singapore and Malaysia, and

547
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,490
The U.S. is there. These are state boards.

548
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:05,880
There is also a role of health system and institution regulators, which play a supplementary role in health professionals.

549
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:11,850
and the government plays a strong role, I said in the in Singapore, Malaysia, mainland and in Taiwan.

550
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:32,740
There are system regulators, like especially in the UK, where other than the councils, there are also different commissions which are system regulators that look at the quality of care, like the Quality Care Quality Commission, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. So they separate some of the supervising, regulated functions to different.

551
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:33,980
系統 regulator。

552
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:36,220
呃。

553
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:48,550
In the U.S., the providers of insurance also take part in regulations, and as I said, that in UK they have a host of different other provider regulators.

554
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,840
compulsory.

555
01:26:51,120 --> 01:27:11,130
Continuing professional training and development is the norm in most countries, and there's also movement towards revalidation, recertification. In UK, the revalidation has started in December 2012, and recertification is already in place in the United States. So

556
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:21,550
Professionals are supposed to demonstrate that they have updated their skills and ability, and they need to be recertified for them to get continue to practice.

557
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:40,380
CBT requirements. Can see that most jurisdictions have compulsory CBT continuing professional development requirements, but for certain jurisdictions, it's only for specialists. And some countries still don't have it, like in Malaysia, but they are now moving towards it.

558
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:48,110
在香港，它係mandatory for only for doctors for specialists doctors and specialist dentists.

559
01:27:49,500 --> 01:28:08,440
and the trend towards detecting and intervening early with poor performance to improve the quality of care. Of course, to to be able to do that, you need to have standards. So for assessing poor performance, so you need to have standards by which you can measure, and provides a threshold against poor practice which can be assessed.

560
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:26,010
There's also a greater separation of roles to reduce the conflict of interest. Investigation and discipline functions in the rank cases being separated, and some jurisdictions have separate accrediting bodies as well.

561
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:46,740
在澳洲、紐西蘭，他們有個獨立的機體來接收投訴。紐西蘭有個醫療實踐者紀律審裁會來聽證和決定紀律行動，所以他們的專業諮詢不處理紀律程序，是一個獨立的醫療實踐者紀律審裁會。在英國是類似的醫療實踐者。

562
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:54,970
tribunal， which provides sharing of services， and the general medical council does the investigative investigative role。

563
01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:04,830
The last item is overseas graduates. They are admitted in different ways. There are different criteria for employing international graduates.

564
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:25,120
many jurisdictions have recognisers of qualified overseas institutions, but most of graduates still need some form of professional assessment and require supervised training. So although they may have a list of of medical schools that they recognise, but it's not that they can register, but they are given provisional

565
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,410
registration， but they've got to work under a period of supervised training.

566
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:34,140
Assessment standards is also done by professions, with the regulators in UK.

567
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,500
呃，most。

568
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:51,280
the the reasons for admission of overseas training of overseas trained doctors is twofold. One is because there is shortage of particular types of health professionals in particular areas, and the second is promote internationalism and promote experience sharing.

569
01:29:51,960 --> 01:30:02,480
criteria is that in Singapore they have 155 institutions that they have a list of registrable basic medical qualifications.

570
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:18,920
馬來西亞是374，但這些機構，the graduate from these institutions can apply，但他們要經註冊，但他們要under the supervision of a qualified medical practitioner for two years。

571
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:39,210
在澳大利亞，他們有三種不同的註冊途徑。對於海外畢業生，他們有所謂標準途徑，所以他們需要被評估、參加考試和進行通常的實習培訓。但他們也有一個 competent authority 途徑，所以有某些機構被他們認可，而對於這些。

572
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:57,710
these graduate from these institutions, they are considered so-called competent, so the pathways are shortened, and then the the pathway for specialists that they require, so they have a variety of pathways to bring in graduates in in Australia, so it's not just one system for all.

573
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:08,050
finally，the implications for Hong Kong，we've asked questions of，does regulation need reform in Hong Kong？Do we need new legislation？

574
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:15,930
Is there a need to adopt common policies, or do we need to have an overarching umbrella body for professional regulation?

575
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:21,340
Is there a need for enhanced world governance and of lay representatives in professional regulation?

576
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:37,970
Do we need more lay representation? What's the relation of government with health system regulations? Should compulsory continuing professional training development be introduced? How do we detect and intervene in with poor performance and improve the quality of care?

577
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:47,090
需要一些 separate role to to separate some of the roles of the regulatory bodies，such as adjudication or investigation or accreditation.

578
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:50,830
And do we need to change the way that we accept overseas trained?

579
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:54,480
healthcare professionals. I think that's the last.

580
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:55,700
transparency。

581
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,430
Thank you, Jim. Okay，咁依家就。

582
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:02,730
可以畀委員發問。

583
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,800
未有嘢問就有有喎，好，你個論語。

584
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:08,260
係。

585
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:23,200
多謝主席。咁多謝阿E.K.呢個咁comprehensive嘅presentation啦。其其實我個問題即係想問翻呢一個，你作為一個專家或者可能秘書長都有個底稿㗎啦。噉你覺唔覺得香港現時？

586
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,870
誒已經被即係監管嘅一啲。

587
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:47,160
醫療專業咧係需要改革，就好似你就係講有個umbrella嘅新嘅一個，即係一把一把傘打曬出嚟咁監管曬咧噉。噉就第一個問題。第二個問題就係誒，仲有一班為數有十幾個discipline，佢係仲未咧係被監管嘅咁啱，同埋開記者會講緊啦咁噉你講。

588
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,920
我唔覺得佢哋係誒都需要根據呢個睇法係被監管咧噉。

589
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,510
係，啊，秘書長唔該。

590
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,270
一誒教授想答先啊，定？

591
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:21,440
我睇你observation先啦。冇冇錯嘅誒，或者你答先啦嚇。阿秘司長先啦噉就。好，就第一就話誒主席就首先嚟講，我哋就誒未有唔係議員講話有咩底稿嘅，因為如果係有底稿咧，我哋都唔想做嗰個報告啦。亦同埋報告咧，就亦都係未曾完全係即係完成嘅嚇。噉啊。

592
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:41,450
教授咧仲會即係誒再跟進埋，特別係比較個先例。噉我只係想強調啲點咧，就係話如果喺香港嚟講咧，因為每個地方咧佢發展都唔同，佢亦都但係一個好肯定咧，就不斷係改變緊啊！亦都係好大原因咧，就因為近期人口老化，對醫療嘅需求啊等等咧，咁變咗冇，亦都喺某啲地方，譬如英。

593
01:33:41,450 --> 01:34:01,460
國咁先算啦。大家都知道咧，出咗幾個好嚴重嘅事件之後咧，係引致嗰個改革嘅。咁所以喺我哋香港嚟講咧，如果需要任何改變咧，都係要有咩特別嘅原因，我哋考慮到嗰個情況先至會係即係誒研究下需要有咩改改變，亦都係睇市民大眾嘅嗰個期望。

594
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:21,610
咁第二個問題咧，就關於仲未曾監管嘅十幾個嗰啲嚟講咧，就我哋都睇緊呢樣嘢。咁最近即係誒法誒ombusman亦都有個報告咧。咁誒我哋嚟講同埋係喺衞生署咧，就係研究緊。咁如果係監管嘅話咧，係用乜嘢嘅方式監管？因為佢呢類咧係。

595
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:41,620
係第一組人數唔係咁多，同埋佢個服務性質咧，從傳統嘅醫療亦都唔係係有一啲唔同嘅地方，咁所以最主要問題就係，係咪如果監管話係咪用同一個方式嘅監管咧？嚇咁然之後外國嘅方面嚟講咧，佢亦都有唔同嘅方法去處理呢個監管嘅問題，咁可以簡。

596
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:45,380
單講句咧，就話誒答呢個問題就係我哋係研究跟進緊。

597
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:47,620
有冇跟進？

598
01:34:48,030 --> 01:35:08,040
楊教授喎，有冇補充啊？誒，主席，我我哋喺做嗰個研究誒時間咧，我哋有見到唔同嘅專業嘅團體嘅，咁當然喺嗰個規管誒嗰個制度咧，有好多嘢喺歷史上都要改嘅，咁即係每一個專業嘅團體都有啲唔同嘅要求嘅，噉我。

599
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:28,050
我相信係誒政府都係睇緊整體係點去再改嘅，咁點改法咧？有啲係比較技術性嘅，有啲係比較行政式誒，有啲係特別係每個專業嘅嘅誒團體就少少唔同嘅需要喺處嘅，咁所以我誒遲啲咧，我相信政府都會誒整體睇翻係應。

600
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:48,060
該係點去改法？即係我哋睇係成個整體啦。咁當然每個專業嘅嘅需求係有啲唔同。咁關於其他冇誒監管嘅誒專業人士咧，好似秘書長話，我哋都初期都有做少少嘅，因為我哋初我哋嘅工作就唔係做呢樣嘢嘅。但係我哋做多嗰個規管制度咧，都有見到唔同。

601
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:54,660
地方咧，唔同國家咧，佢哋嘅方式去規管呢啲係冇吸納嗰個誒。

602
01:35:54,940 --> 01:36:06,140
立法嘅誒，醫護人員嗰個規管制度咧，因唔同嘅法法去處理嘅。咁呢個相信政府都會同我哋討論，將來係點去處理啲呢班誒專業人士。

603
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:27,140
你有分幾鐘㗎？兩分鐘。誒，就係話畀書長講，即係嗰十五個未被監管嗰個醫療專業嘅人數少咧，唔少嘅。根據即係Ombudsman嗰頁開講有七千幾人。啊，呢個係一個唔少嘅數量。當然啦，有十五個discipline，噉你如果再除翻，梗係少啦。咁但係即係咁呢班喺個基層醫療同埋喺中層醫療好大貢獻嘅一班。

604
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:47,150
朋友日日都可能喺度，即係會幫緊市民嘅時間。如果冇一個一個有效嘅監管機制咧，咁呢個政府咧，即係ombudsman講咧，行政失當嘅一個情況嚟嘅。呢個唔係唔會去到呢個誒社會資源公署嗰度講呢個第一點。第二點其實講緊呢樣嘢，想佢將翻考慮嘅就係其實我哋講緊，正正咧就係阿楊教授講過一個暗。

605
01:36:47,150 --> 01:37:07,160
嘅一個legislation嘅做法就係話咧係誒將佢哋咧擺埋一齊去做曬呢個係一個可行性啊。當然唔係唔係一個即係一定係做噉樣做。咁而正正而家喺香港就係三五九呢一條substantive medical professional regulation呢一呢條例，我我哋先條例先可以做到呢樣嘢。噉我想睇下秘書長咧就即係應該可以考慮一下咧係點樣。

606
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:27,170
跟進翻呢個事件，唔該，主席。係，李司長。係，主席就誒，正如啊李員講得啱，我哋就係即係誒，亦都考慮類似噉嘅因素嘅。咁當然即係話誒，好多個監管咧係歷史一路發展落嚟。咁喺今時今日，如果個新嘅所謂專職醫療嗰個專業要受監管。

607
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:47,180
嘅時候係咪用翻傳統嗰套咧，定係話一啲較為新啲嘅方法咧？另一方面，亦都係佢嗰個要睇翻嗰個專業本身佢嗰個工作性質嗰個風險對市民嘅影響，同埋監管嗰個成本效益。因為你監管咧，一方面你當然話係可以保障誒嗰。

608
01:37:47,180 --> 01:38:07,190
個誒用呢服務嘅人，但另一方面咧，亦都影響到咧佢嗰個專業嗰個發展啊，或者係成本等等嘅。噉我並不表示，因為噉嘅時候，我哋唔去考慮，而係話我哋係諗緊用一啲係較為即係誒現代啲嘅概念去監管佢哋，特別係呢啲嚟講好多咧係本地冇專專職嘅。

609
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:21,740
訓練嘅，咁呢度亦都係一個問題，我哋即係要處理啊，就話咗佢喺外國翻嚟嘅經嘅資歷嘅時候，我哋用乜嘢嘅標準咧？等等咧，呢啲都係一較為細節性嘅嘢。但係簡單講就係話，我哋係誒研究緊，亦都跟進緊嘅。

610
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:26,220
O.K.，仲有廿秒喎，你唔使啦，係嘛？

611
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,200
阿方講完。

612
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,190
唔該，舉證。

613
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,570
嗯。

614
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:46,950
首先啊，多謝啊楊教授，你呢份咁詳細嘅報告啦，同埋呢個我哋都香港醫療方面係即係非常急需要你呢啲噉嘅資料啦。噉你花咗咁多時間，即係睇曬全世界啲嘢啦。

615
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:52,260
即係我想針對，即係講香港邊啲係真係好急需嘅，OK？

616
01:38:52,640 --> 01:39:02,540
就誒，第一我知道咧，就誒醫管局有時需要咧，就有種叫做誒限制註冊（restricted registration）嘅嗰啲噉。

617
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:15,420
咁呢啲入嚟咧就係誒係需唔需要考試嘅？但係佢入嚟咧係每年都係要佢renew嘅，即係佢係誒，比如簽畀佢係有效係一年嘅。

618
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:25,240
噉我覺得有時呢啲噉嘅由外國嚟到香港嘅咧，啊，limited ok，limited registration。咁呢啲咧係誒。

619
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,250
如果佢啱啱嚟香港，

620
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:46,850
一年咧就好快嘅啫，因為你入到醫管局，起碼要帶領你熟悉個環境咧，都要成半年嘅。咁一陣間又夠期啦。咁有冇諗下可唔可以呢啲噉嘅limited registration一落嚟就可以畀佢三年咧？即係我覺得三年係比較一個即係合理啲嘅時間嚇。

621
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:59,570
仲有就係話誒個誒，備選，我想講翻就係嗰啲人手又係嗰啲嘢consultant咧，即係升到上consultant咧，真係個非常唔容易嘅事。

622
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:19,900
但因為要晉升嘅機會咧，咁好多時又冇得留低嘅，咁可唔可以即係延長嗰個退休時間咧？由六十或者去到六十五歲咧？因為如果佢延長嗰五年時間，對佢個病人睇病啊，對個效率嗰方面真係會會增加。

623
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,660
係好好好多嘅。

624
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:31,970
仲有就係頭先誒，秘書長你又講到嗰個考試啦。今年十月初咧，就嗰個醫委會就考一年考兩次啦，噉。

625
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,620
咁考兩。

626
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:54,250
問埋佢，問埋佢。O.K.咁考兩次有冇即係可唔可以？有我知道廣東話係其中一個requirement嚟嘅。咁呢樣嘢會使到好多人咧就會止步嘅，同埋考試呢樣你要你要考最basic嗰啲嘢咧，有啲就specialist啲咧，佢唔肯翻嚟考呢個最基。

627
01:40:54,250 --> 01:41:14,260
基本事嘅，有冇諗下個考試嗰度可以即係轉變一下咧，去吸引到多啲人入嚟香港考試，翻嚟香港掛牌啊？唔該，係啊，秘書長唔該。就主席，就關於有限度註冊嗰樣咧，就係我諗大家都知道個問題喺邊一度。咁誒，現時嚟講咧，根據

628
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:34,270
個法例咧就係醫務委員會，即係佢係審批，同埋咧係誒一年咧應該就係個法例，亦都係規限住係一年嘅。咁當然我哋亦都如果有噉嘅需要，見到噉嘅情況咧，亦都即係可可能會同即係希望同誒醫務委員會跟進一下。咁但係呢方面咧，亦都係明。

629
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:54,280
白就喺法例之下咧，呢個係醫務委員會嘅權力。至於第二樣就係話誒醫管局嗰個退休年齡嚇，咁呢個咧亦都係我哋而家睇緊，就係話長遠嘅人手嗰個問題。之後咧就譬如真係見到好嚴重嘅問題嘅時候咧，實際上嘅數字點樣樣噉，然之後就要再同即係。

630
01:41:54,280 --> 01:42:14,290
要同醫管局傾傾，就譬如呢啲屬於係所以短期嘅措施，咁有冇辦法處理咧？咁當然喺我哋一方面嘅角度就係話啊，延長我退休年齡，但係另一方面咧，亦都要睇翻即係醫管局自己內部啊，即係醫生本身對呢個睇法係點咧？因為你延長我退休年齡，即係邊？

631
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:34,300
變咗新一批，佢就晉升機會少咗啦。個但接呢個誒晉升嘅問題，但另一方面咧，亦都係少咗機會去爭取個經驗嘅。咁所以要平衡翻兩面，就係話誒，可能譬如舉例，即係呢，純粹係其中可以諗嘅辦法，就係話你唔係退休，唔係完全嘅退休，而係話佢真係退休，不過係在。

632
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:54,310
聘請翻佢，變咗佢咪唔影響現有嘅同事嗰晉升啊，同埋佢嘅經驗嗰個誒精誒誒爭取嘅經驗等等噉樣樣。但另一方面咧，你人手亦都增多，咁呢個好處就係話亦都可能更加吸引，因為點解佢唔需要綁住係限住時間啦啊？譬如咧，佢變咗。

633
01:42:54,310 --> 01:43:14,320
對佢嗰個退休醫生嚟講咧，亦都係有啲靈活性。退休之後佢未必想做全職嘅呢啲咧，我哋都係誒第一就醫管局已經睇緊，第二亦都係喺嗰個檢討嘅過程咧，我哋都要考慮。但係咧，即係我只係想強調一點啊，就係好多時個問題咧，亦都要睇特別係牽涉到人事問題嘅時候咧，亦都要睇翻另外一方面，就係現有。

634
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:34,330
嚟緊嘅員工，佢哋嚇係點睇法咧？咁最主要就係話大家認同個問題，即係而家第一樣就認罪，就係話大家都認同係有一個短缺嘅問題，亦都係一個較為嚴重嘅問題。但係呢個可能係一個中短期嘅問題，咁變咗咧，雙方就能夠坐低客觀去傾傾，有咩辦法？

635
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:41,480
解決即係我即係作誒簡單答議員問題咧，就係我哋同煙管局喺方面咧係積極係研究同埋跟進緊嘅。

636
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,890
考兩次試。

637
01:43:45,940 --> 01:44:05,950
啊，考兩次試嗰個至於誒嗰個英文、中文等等咧，就亦都係，因為呢個咧係牽涉到個專業嗰個質素咧。應該係可以用中文考嘅。誒，佢但問題好好似我嘅理解係唔得嘅，但係咧佢有佢有傳譯嘅，佢有傳譯畀你嘅，因為你兩兩即係語言嗰個。

638
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:25,960
我誒香港係係三部分㗎嘛考試係係嚇第二部分係考英文係英有個專門英文試嚇，淨係考語文唔係考專業嘅。第一第三部分係考臨牀嘅卷同埋係誒臨牀見病人咧，係可以用中文考㗎嘛？係啊，但係我理解。

639
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:45,970
睇下議員阿方元文咧，佢係講緊係嗰啲專科專科醫生啊。佢翻到嚟咧，佢就係佢問兩個問題，係啦，因為我哋考試個語文會阻礙咗佢哋。噉我依家問確認一樣嘢，係可以用中文考嘅。唔係基本嗰個執業試可以用中文考嘅。係係。

640
01:44:45,970 --> 01:45:05,980
啱啊嘛，第二咧就係嗰啲專科，外國註冊過有經驗嘅專科，已經有經驗嘅專科醫生都要打翻基本嘢。唔係佢要講，嚇，議員嘅理解好就佢要佢要一定用廣東話啊嘛，即係clinical嗰part啊，用廣東話。咁呢，我就唔好肯定要用廣東話。我覺得應該唔係，唔係，但我可以即係誒復翻。

641
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:25,990
翻議員咧，即係議員有個誤解，佢就話咧專科有經驗嘅醫生，佢唔肯翻嚟，就因為佢喺外國用咗英文咁耐。你而家考clinical第三個part咧，就要用廣東話問病，咁變咗好多咧，就因為咁咧就唔想翻嚟啦。噉我會查一查先，再復翻議員呢樣就。跟住我哋而家就啱同你一樣，同啊主席嘅理解一樣，就係應該唔係一個問題嚟嘅。

642
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,350
基本執照試可以用中文考，執照試可以用中文考。

643
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:42,740
跟住係啊，國家奇緣，我提一提你咧，個鐘啊兩分鐘嘅啫，但係淨係誒計你發言嘅時間，你政府答幾陣時個鐘會停咗嘅，善用時間。

644
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:57,740
有冇啊？朱靜慶，我都係問兩個簡單，一個咧就係啊，我見到楊醫生咧，啊楊教授咁好多謝你嗰個研究咧。咁政府喺個規管嗰度即係有有嗰個報告咧，我相信而家呢個係中期嘅報告嚟嘅。

645
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:09,160
幾時會有個完整嘅報告，同埋幾時會開始會誒做一啲檢討，甚至即係其實個問題問咗話需唔需要立法，我相信一定要。如果咪立唔到。

646
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:29,450
第二個咧就係亦都係誒頭先啊，李國麟都提到一啲係其他嘅同誒衞生有關嘅一啲專業，其實同啲市民都係息息相關嘅。我特別舉兩個咧，一個就係嗰個營養師啦，第二個就係嗰啲誒臨牀心理學家啦。咁大家都唔可以以為佢。

647
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:49,460
佢咧係冇對個公眾好大嘅影響，因為任何人喺香港而家咧係唔需要一個正式嘅註冊或者監管就可以聲稱呢兩個行業嘅咁呢兩個咧就政府係冇理到，但係我相信對於公眾嘅影響好大，因為你唔保障佢嘅話，邊個保障佢哋？咁呢個政府會唔會優先去處理？

648
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,440
如果會嘅話，係幾時？

649
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,420
係啊，秘書長唔該。

650
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:54,600
主席。

651
01:46:54,900 --> 01:47:14,910
關於誒誒中大同我哋做呢個研究報告咧，佢而家嚟講咧就係誒有個中期嘅報告。噉我哋預計係未未來嘅兩三個月咧，佢應該就有個即係最終嗰個報告。噉我哋咧就會研究之後咧，就再翻翻嚟嘅小組就係即係介紹即係政。

652
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:26,500
副啊，接受個報告之後，誒個睇法係點樣樣？會有咩跟進？會做啲咩嘢？噉我哋希望嚟緊幾個月咧，就做呢誒呢樣嘅工作嘅。要等佢個報告完成咗之後。

653
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:46,790
第二咧就係規管嗰度營養師等等嗰啲嚟講咧，就正係頭先我答阿李源一樣咧，就係我哋呢次係會睇嘅，係會研究，即係未必一定係喺翻呢個報告入邊，因為佢呢個報告咧係係針對咧係現時已經接受規管同埋一啲較為歷史嘅特別主要個醫療誒專業醫生啊。

654
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:52,250
護士啊、牙醫啊等等嗰啲，誒其他嗰啲誒誒。

655
01:47:52,530 --> 01:48:12,540
專職醫療咧，因為佢即係佢嗰個範疇比較闊啊。因為第一樣決定咧就係邊一啲係要監管，因為好多都覺得自己係㗎嘛。譬如頭先你睇營養師咁好同埋比較明顯啲啊，臨牀跟心理學嗰啲亦都比較明顯啲。噉我哋要睇啲外國嘅經驗係邊啲嚟講係納入呢個唔會係一刀切嘅。即係我哋初現時嘅睇法就係話。

656
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:24,200
有一啲邊啲係市民關注、對健康係有較為直接影響嘅時候咧，我哋首先咧就處理咗，要睇用咩方法係監管佢比較好。但係咪用到好似同醫生一樣？

657
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:44,490
咁嚴監噉嘅形式嘅監管咧，就要研究啦。因為譬如你醫生，你都知啦，就係話你哋嗰個秘書處咧係公房畀錢噉樣嘅情況，係律師噉。噉我仲係咪再行呢套咧嚇噉樣樣咁？呢啲要諗咁呢個結構成立咗之後咧，將來要睇個社會發展有新嘅，亦都覺得需要監管嘅，亦都會即係納入翻。

658
01:48:44,490 --> 01:49:04,500
呢個我哋係做緊，我哋希望嚟緊個幾個住啲一年左右咧，我唔可以講一定嚇呢樣咧就係先先咧就衞生署佢而家咧係即係諗緊一個模式嘅出嚟，特別係譬如參考外國個個個經驗。我最主要就唔想係用翻同一套，譬如而家監管，譬如醫生、護士佢嗰個歷史背景咁嚴。

659
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,900
唔格嘅方法去誒監管新新呢類嘅專職醫療嘅。

660
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:30,240
你仲有五十四秒嚇咪啊，主席，我想問一問咧，就係你你話唔用呢一個噉嘅方法咧，即係我我都有啲唔同嘅睇法。因為如果你一係唔監管嘅話，你監管咧，一定有個水準咧，係要係有一個對稱性嘅。噉我想誒睇兩樣嘢咧，一個就係監管入邊。

661
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:50,250
連所牽涉嘅錢係幾多咧？即係政府應該計到個數啦。同埋某程度上，我相信嗰個專業咧，你亦都有冇同佢傾過咧？佢會唔會都係願意負擔部分？我舉一個例，誒律師會、大律師公會咧，佢哋都有一個自己會所主導嘅一個誒制度咧，係包括誒。

662
01:49:50,390 --> 01:50:03,610
註冊同埋一個懲處嘅制度，咁入邊牽涉啲錢咧，都係佢兩個大部分都係佢呢兩個會佢自己畀翻嘅。其實你係咪政府有少少即係驚得多咗咧？你有冇同個專業傾過？

663
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:24,890
主席就係呢啲，全部咧都係我哋即係現時即係考慮緊嘅。即係其中一個較為複雜啲嘅問題，就係舉例，譬如譬如醫醫科醫生或者護士咧，我哋本地兩間大學有訓練出嚟嘅時候咧，變咗個標準啊等等咧，都較易定到。譬如有一啲咧，我哋根本就香港係冇出嘅。

664
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:44,900
嚇，同埋一啲所謂有少少近似另類誒醫療嗰啲嚟講咧，利用佢亦都唔同地方翻嚟咧，亦都有唔同嘅標準等等啊。咁邊度呢啲咧？全世界全部都係即係而家全全部係研究緊，係點樣點樣誒方法去監管，亦都睇睇外國即係人哋有已經已經做緊嘅咧嘛。咁咁所以即係我即係講即係。

665
01:50:44,900 --> 01:51:01,320
誒簡單答咧，就係話我哋係全部呢啲都明白，同埋研究緊，係亦都到咁上下。當我哋有個構思嘅時候，好似會再翻翻嚟誒誒醫療小誒小組嗰度咧，向大家彙報，亦都聽聽即係大家嗰個即係意見。

666
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:03,920
有六秒鐘。

667
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,060
用唔少。

668
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:23,540
唔要唔我有啲有兩個問題問一問嚇，一個問題問阿楊教授，第二個問題係問阿秘書長。想問一問阿楊教授咧，嚟我睇呢個表啊嚇嚇，你誒一個誒附件誒C啊嚇，就話比較海外地區同埋香港嗰個誒。

669
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:44,070
醫生個監管咁嗰度第一難嗰度咧就係規管醫護人員嗰個性質啊，即係嗰個規管嘅機構嘅性質。噉就有分自我規管與公眾共同規管，同埋政府高度監察。噉我睇再隔兩個column下邊咧，就係嗰個規管機構嘅成員嘅比例嗰度。

670
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:46,730
嚇有各種各樣嘅percentage啊！

671
01:51:47,720 --> 01:52:07,730
咁想問一問咧，誒嗰個專業成員委任嘅意思係政府委任啊，亦或邊一個委任咧？咁同埋第二德國嗰度咧就係話自我規管嘅剔咗，咁但係下邊嗰度就就唔知嗰啲成員喺邊度嚟嘅嚇？呢個就即係請聲阿楊教授解釋下啦嚇。咁第二個問題想問啊，秘書長嘅咧就係嗱。

672
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:11,270
楊教授就做一個學術研究啊，嚇噉佢又可以唔理啲。

673
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:18,380
誒啲政治啊、法律嗰啲嘢，不過就想問一問政府咧，根據基本法一百四廿二咧，若果冇記錯咧。

674
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,350
就規定咗。

675
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:24,190
係規規定咗專業自主嗰個要求咧。

676
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:30,900
係誒，可可以容許政府去立法更改嗰個空間有幾大嘅？

677
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:51,980
兩個問題啫，係簡單嘅。主席喺嗰個誒委任咧，一般係誒，譬如喺好多地方咧，而家就係政府去委任嘅，即係佢哋pointed咧，通常就係政府去委任，或者佢喺個有時佢會誒買個板睇邊個興趣嘅。咁而家喺英國咧就好興咧，去睇市民有邊個想參與。

678
01:52:51,980 --> 01:53:11,990
誒唔同嘅機構咧，佢就請啲人去申請，噉佢就揀嘅。啊，噉佢唔同嘅做法咧，喺誒誒喺誒有啲地方咧就話誒冇啲資料咧，因為呢度係係政府已經畀咗嗰個誒誒專業人去自己做嘅。

679
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:26,940
所以我哋嗰啲資料咧就係呢度咧就冇冇足夠，即係冇資料咁解。我哋search翻我哋誒search翻攞唔到，但係我哋可以有資料嘅，即係我哋可以問，譬如有興趣，嚇去問嘅，即係未知道咁解，嚇嚇。

680
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:39,600
咁業外人士嗰度都係委任㗎啦，其實都係。係啊。O.K. 哈，噉啊，秘書長嗰個專業資管法嗰個規定，即係對政府可以立法，即係落實呢啲誒。

681
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:43,440
可可能會建議嘅建議嘅空間有幾大？

682
01:53:43,720 --> 01:54:03,730
就即係主席正你提咧，就係話誒，佢已經規定咗所謂專業自主。首先，我哋都要睇翻香港特勢特殊嗰個情況同埋嗰個需要。咁而家我哋做完個研究之下咧，亦都睇睇即係喺外國經驗喺香港嘅情況之下，譬如有啲咩嘢係認為係需要改善或者改進嘅啊。噉嘅時候咧，亦都要同有關。

683
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:23,740
關嘅專業團體即係傾商量嘅之後，如果大家同意認為係可做嘅，譬如舉一個例子，唔係一定係落實，譬如C.P.D.咁先算，嗱人全世界都做啦。咁噉嘅情況之下，香港係咪需要咧？咁至於做嘅時候用咩嘢內容、用咩形式，嗱大家都即係可以接受得到，對市民有保障，對嗰個專業亦都唔。

684
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:43,750
會太多嘅障礙咧，咁譬如呢，可以慢慢傾傾掂咗咪得咯嗱。如果唔係嘅話咧，咁到最後咧，亦都係到亦都要即係。如果就算我係立法嘅話，先舉例噉樣，都要經過即係立法會嘅通過啊。咁但當然任何法例通過之前，我哋提出嘅時候，亦都要考慮翻佢有冇同即。

685
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:56,400
基本法嘅衝突啦，咁基本法入邊係個原則嘅啫，即係專業自主咁嚇。咁至於呢啲咧，我哋係定即係絕對係會即係誒留意住嘅。OK得，噉啊，其他事項。

686
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:01,050
誒，仲有咩？嗱，有一樣好重要嘅其他事項就係誒。

687
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,990
小組委員會就會。

688
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:13,680
即係繼續工作，因為我哋個會小組呢個小組已經成立咗一年，噉就要向內會交代，因為一般而言就應該係誒。

689
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:15,560
一年嘅。

690
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:35,850
咁依家就會要求係誒延長個工作時間一年，同意啊嘛。噉啊，衞生事務委員會已經係誒支持咗㗎啦嚇。噉就會喺十一月十五號嘅內務委員會會議上面誒申請啦嚇。咁另外一樣嘢就下以下次會議嘅日期就係十二月九號禮拜一，就兩點半。

691
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:38,000
噉我想問一問政府。

692
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:39,250
誒。

693
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:45,290
政府就話係想講嗰個醫療保障嘅監管架構同埋索償。

694
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,800
嗰個調解機制嘅設計。

695
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:55,200
咁但係近來似乎佢興趣大啲，呢幾日政府吹吹風多就係嗰個醫療保障產品嘅詳細設計㗎嘛。

696
01:55:55,790 --> 01:56:01,810
就似乎誒嗰個係比較大家有興趣啲，可唔可以十月九號講嗰個啊？

697
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:03,710
可以，可以，可以，好嘛。

698
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,180
因為呢個，我相信大家係關注多啲，就係嗰個產品個詳細。

699
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:18,100
設計同埋嗰個經費嘅建議，好嘛？十二月九號嘅建議。咁另外咧，有關人手嗰度咧，我諗係一分鐘。你嗰個model可唔可以？

700
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:20,530
揾個，即係嗰個誒。

701
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:25,790
嗰個數學工具，直情畀我哋研究下，咁因為。

702
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:29,760
唔緊要，我都知道呢個係一個初步嘅試一試。

703
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:43,310
睇睇，因為誒真係需要詳細去測試個model。咁同埋，因為我頭先提嗰個個分配嗰個問題咧，雖然阿Dr Johnson就話公營還公營去評估人手需要，私營還私營評估嗰人手需要。

704
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:46,040
但係你係控制唔到嗰啲人手嘅流向。

705
01:56:47,720 --> 01:57:07,730
你明嘛？你股公營要幾多人先？要幾多人？結果啲人啊，留曬喺私營嗰度，噉啊搞唔掂啫嘛。噉樣噉，所以我哋所以就想第一樣咧，就想睇下可唔可以真係提供嗰個模型，真係唔係淨係一個簡介，直情嗰個工具可以fit到數字入去，去計到數嘅。咁同埋我。

706
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:08,710
誒。

707
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:29,090
會有好多問題，我睇下誒歸納咗之後誒約個時間再請個Doctor Johnson上嚟溝通啊，咁好嘛？啊，主席就咁第一樣嘢即係盡可以畀個模型我哋睇睇先咯。嗱，我會同香港大學傾傾，即係睇下佢可以提供到嘅係個專利啊，定係佢哋嘅嚇嚇，唔係個。

708
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:49,100
即係問題就話佢係個係咩嘢嚟？因為佢基本上而家電腦入邊噉，我可唔可以詳細講清楚個function啊、啲key input data啊嗰啲噉樣？睇睇有乜嘢我再傾傾，睇下我邊提供得到畀你哋。係啊，李國麟議。主席、主席，我有啲補充嘅就係，如果真係有乜需要咧，啲遲啲我唔知點樣學報報告可能出定未出。即係出咗之後咧，我反。

709
01:57:49,100 --> 01:58:09,110
有興趣睇嘅就係到底即係Johnson嗰個唔係Miracle Model係咁做啦，政府入啲咩出啲咩？我呢個我哋自己最重要想睇，因為佢有四個approach㗎嘛，即係佢入啲咩落去咩數據，好似即係我我哋可能覺得一個醫一個醫生要睇十分鐘，咁政府有冇入落去咧？入咗有幾多個醫生類似嘢？咁之後我哋需要。

710
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:28,330
佢嗰四嘅approach係講，佢review咗人哋以往係有四嘅approach，佢依家佢主要係用第二嗰個。係，咁但係即係如果其他嘅approach，同埋跟住入咩data落去，即係有好多scenario㗎嘛。我反而我我我就想攞佢噉，係啦，即係我我就我我我就唔識去，我就唔識去睇佢嗰個。

711
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:38,560
machinery。不過我興趣就係政府有個站名，我哋知道咧入啲咩data落呢個machinery，出啲乜嘢scenario，噉就project到咩嘅 manpower，因為有resource implication。

712
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:40,180
O.K.

713
01:58:40,460 --> 01:59:00,070
再同你同秘書嗰邊傾傾，睇下提交咩，可能請個專家小組，因為我覺得可能唔係其他member可能唔係咁深入，因為我我哋同你哋傾傾嘅，睇下你可能有專家小組。咁誒，噉啊多謝各位，下次會議十二月九號，下晝兩點半，講醫療產品嘅設計同埋經費。好，噉啊多謝各位。啱啱。
