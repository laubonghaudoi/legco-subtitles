1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,390
人數亦都夠曬足，噉我哋開始今次嘅會議，噉就好多謝。

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,150
政府官員。

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,030
出席今日嘅會議。

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,720
噉我就稍作介紹啦，就誒。

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,620
同樣咧，就係。

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:27,050
陳慧敏女士，運防局首席助理秘書長李志剛先生，環境保護署首席環境保護主任。

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:47,500
鄭龍德先生，海事處處理總經理。噉就仲有黎英強先生，海事處總海運政策主任。方仲怡先生，海事處高級驗船主任。陳雅陳洛雅女士係運份運防局助理秘書長。噉我哋都啊係啦，請曬團體入嚟啦。

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,490
團體咧有三位。

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,870
呢個我。

10
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:23,820
先講廣東話先嚇。團體有三位咁咧，就係請大家知悉，係誒各位可以就附屬法例嘅相關事宜發表意見。噉就耳筒嗰度咧，就可以有誒即時傳譯嘅頻道。另係現場一係粵語，二係英語，三係普通話。

11
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:43,830
咁亦都提醒各位人士咧，除咗立法會議員同埋出席嘅指定官員之外咧，各位今日團體代表出席嘅發言咧，係不會受到《立法會嘅權力及特權條例》嘅豁免條文嘅保障嘅。啊，let me誒誒，first of all，welcome the the presence of members of。

12
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:56,080
NGO，that include the Mr Joe Wilson of Living Lama and Miss Louis Preston of Living Islands Movement，and

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:17,250
You could choose simultaneous interpretation with the earpiece and turn to channel two for interpretation from the Cantonese to English. And please be reminded that, with the exception of the Legislative Councillor and the Government of

14
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:37,260
Officials representative of the NGO would not be protected by the power and privilege the ordinance. So having said that, without any further ado, let's begin the discussion of today. And since there is not many.

15
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:49,970
representatives, so I tend to be very relaxed with the time allowed for each representatives. So let's start with the eight minutes each, and

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:10,260
normally， we have only three minutes each， so let's start with eight minutes each， and then after that， we could take further question from the legislative councillor， and maybe a dialogue between members of the NGO and the officials。OK，噉我就翻翻去廣東話啦，跟住就嚇。

17
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,970
嘅誒，我就先請誒。

18
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:29,580
委員就今日呢個會議嘅安排，誒有冇一啲誒意見想畀先？如果冇咧，我就請團體發言。咁第一個咧就係楊崇榮先生，係世界自然基金會香港分會嘅，請。

19
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:50,910
係誒，多謝主席。噉就誒，我哋世界自然基金會啦，其實都好關注我哋香港嘅海洋垃圾問題嘅。咁其實香港嘅海洋啦，同埋沿海嘅地區，長期都有好多嘅誒海洋垃圾去積聚啦。咁所以我哋都好歡迎政府去誒訂立一個新嘅規例啦，去誒取代翻舊有嘅雙船防。

20
00:03:50,910 --> 00:04:10,920
指廢物污染嘅規例嘅咁誒，但係咧，我哋亦都非常之關注翻我哋執法部門咧，究竟佢個監管啦同埋執法嘅力度咧，係咪足夠去配合翻呢個規例，同埋去阻嚇到我哋誒海上拋置垃圾嘅一啲行為嘅噉。以下咧，我就想誒分享一啲唔同嘅個案啦，去誒誒反映翻一個香。

21
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:30,930
香港嘅就海洋垃圾污染嘅問題，同埋去分析翻而家現時嘅一啲誒執法嘅情況，同埋我哋會誒就翻呢啲情況啦，去作出一啲建議嘅。咁第一個誒個案啦，噉就係誒關於喺香港仔避風塘嘅。咁其實我哋誒做過一啲調查啦，其實其實就誒經常都會發現大量嘅家居垃圾。

22
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:50,940
譬如係一啲膠樽啦、餐具、食物包裝盒啊，同埋誒快餐盒等等嘅唔同嘅垃圾咧，都會喺水面上面漂浮嘅。咁根據翻啲當地嘅誒市民啦，佢哋反映翻咧，其實有漁民咧喺嗰度去誒唔恰當噉樣去誒棄置垃圾，咁造成呢啲垃圾嘅積聚嘅另一方。

23
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:10,950
方面咧，更加明顯嘅問題就係我哋成日都會發現到好多嘅法普膠箱係誒，即係用嚟做一啲即係裝裝魚啊嗰啲嘅嘅作用嘅噉啊誒，好明顯顯示咧，佢哋全部咧都係由漁市場啦同埋一啲漁船高嚟嘅咁誒，即使啦誒海事處反映翻，其實每日咧。

24
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:21,400
由朝到晚咧，佢都有船隻去清理翻海上垃圾。咁但係因為呢個情況咧，依然非常之惡劣啦。噉我哋就即係質疑翻個執法力度咧係不足嘅。

25
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:40,060
咁另外咧，關於垃圾灣嘅情況咧，誒，我哋睇翻誒海事署去回覆陳偉業議員啦，咁去講翻誒，佢哋係曾經喺學誒垃圾灣附近去做過一啲考察嘅情況嘅，噉就誒發現嗰度咧就冇乜漂浮垃圾嘅，咁但係咧，我哋去誒即係睇翻誒。

26
00:05:40,430 --> 00:06:00,440
環保署誒，佢最近誒發布嘅一個報告啦，噉就都有好明顯去指出咧誒風向啦，同埋水流咧都會影響到海上垃圾分佈嘅。咁所以我哋就質疑咧，單單去靠一個短時間嘅實地考察咧，就未必足以去反映翻嗰度嘅垃圾漂浮情況嘅。咁所以就即係呢點。

27
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,160
咁要注意翻啦。咁另外咧，誒誒。

28
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:24,650
呢個香港海上垃圾源頭同埋去向調查嘅報告啦，噉佢入面嘅誒分類方法咧，就唔能夠真正去分辨翻一啲積氣物品究竟佢係陸上啦定係海上嘅源頭嘅。咁所以咧誒，政府佢誒指出有八成嘅海上垃圾都係陸上來源咧，呢個數字只可以做。

29
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:44,660
做一個參考作用。咁另外，我哋亦都好明顯去發現到垃圾灣上面咧，有好多嘅魚網啦、浮波等等嘅同漁業相關嘅誒一啲垃圾嘅。咁好明顯都係同一啲海洋嘅活動有關啦。噉就即係同個誒雙船去棄置啲垃圾咧，誒即係都會有一個好大嘅關係嘅。咁所以。

30
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,760
政府咧就需要進行更加多嘅監察同埋調查，去了解翻呢個導致垃圾灣嘅狀況嗰個原因。

31
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:12,490
咁另外，我哋去分析翻誒海上漂浮垃圾嘅成因啦。咁第一個當然就係由船泊上面去棄置啦。噉我哋都收到好多唔同嘅市民去報告翻咧，有啲唔同嘅從業者，譬如係誒遊艇啦，同埋漁船咧，佢哋就會將垃圾喺夜媽媽嘅時候冇乜人見到嘅時候咧，直接抌落海嗰度嘅。咁另外咧誒有啲海

32
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:32,500
海事署佢哋去提供畀船隻去收集海洋誒，佢哋一啲家居垃圾嘅黃色垃圾袋啦。我哋亦都喺一啲唔同嘅沙灘上面或者海上面咧，會揾到嘅噉，所以都誒都好直接去指向翻一啲嘅船隻去直接拋棄垃圾嘅情況嘅。咁另外就亦都有啲唔同嘅海上活動去產生啦。

33
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,920
噉就譬如係一啲漁業相關嘅活動啦，誒。

34
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:56,210
咁其實呢啲誒嘅垃圾咧，都會對於我哋嘅海洋生態啊，都會有好嚴重嘅影響啦。同埋對於個即係誒一個航海安全啊，都會有有嚴重嘅影響嘅。咁所以就即係都非常之值得去關注翻呢啲嘅誒，譬如廢棄拖網啦，或者其他海洋垃圾嘅分佈同嘅數量。

35
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,720
同埋，究竟佢哋點樣去影響到我哋香港嘅海洋生態？

36
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:20,170
咁誒第三咧，我哋就會分析翻究竟局方嗰個執法嘅情況嘅。噉我哋都好欣賞咧，誒海事署其實都會定期去向一啲唔同嘅，即係同海海上活動有關嘅一啲唔同嘅團體啦，去宣傳翻海港清潔啦，同埋呼籲翻佢哋去即係妥善處理啲垃圾嘅。咁但係咧。

37
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:40,180
經過咁多年嚟咧，嗰個海上垃圾嘅情況咧，依然未有大幅改善嘅。咁譬如就誒睇翻我嗰個誒，即係嗰個意見書嘅圖二啦。噉就係誒去顯示翻海事處喺一九九七至零一四年喺海港收集嘅垃圾量嘅。咁其實喺二零零三年到目前為止咧，嗰個垃圾個收集量

38
00:08:40,180 --> 00:09:00,190
量咧一路都係一萬一千至一萬二千公噸，咁誒即係反映翻嗰個情況咧，喺十一年以嚟咧都冇顯著噉樣去減少。咁但係另一方面咧，喺圖三嗰度咧就會誒畀大家睇到嗰個海上棄置垃圾嘅定罪個案咧，就喺九九年嘅一百三十一宗誒下降。

39
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:20,200
到二零一四年嘅十一宗，噉我哋就好懷疑，究竟點解會喺個海洋垃圾嗰個誒情嗰個嚴重情況咧，一路都維持喺一個高位嘅時候，嗰個執法個定罪嘅個案咧係下跌得咁加咁犀利嘅，噉我哋就懷疑嗰個執法力度係咪有所下降咧？

40
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:41,010
咁另一點咧就係誒關於個誒海事處向船隻去收集家居垃圾嘅服務啦。咁其實我哋就誒睇到咧喺二零零六年至到二零一四年咧，嗰個收集嘅垃圾量大概都係四千到四千五百公噸嘅水平嘅。咁誒即係都冇特別去即係更加去加大個力。

41
00:09:41,010 --> 00:10:01,020
度啦，咁但係其實如果呢個服務咧可以覆蓋更加多嘅範圍啦，去同更加多嘅船隻去收集翻佢哋家居垃圾咧，噉我哋即係都期望嗰個棄置喺垃圾誒棄置喺海上嘅垃圾嘅數量咧會顯著減少。噉樣去另一方面咧，亦都去減輕翻我哋去喺海上面或者喺岸上。

42
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,290
面去收集一啲海洋垃圾嗰個誒嗰個壓力嘅。

43
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:25,770
咁總結而言咧，噉我哋就誒世界自然基金會咧，噉就希望誒當局咧去優化翻各個部門去處理海上垃圾嘅工作啦，去去改善翻海洋垃圾嘅情況嘅。咁第一咧就係要有效去阻嚇翻一啲非法棄置垃圾嘅情況啦。咁海事署同埋其他執法部門咧就。

44
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:45,780
就需要去找去揾出一啲海上拋棄垃圾嘅黑點，咁同埋去喺呢啲地方，切實去加強執法力度，去維持翻海岸清潔嘅。咁第二就係即係同一啲漁業有關嘅海洋垃圾啦，譬如係啲鬼網同埋拖網嘅誒帶嚟嘅影響咧。噉我哋就即係喺香港未有有系統咁去檢視。

45
00:10:45,780 --> 00:11:05,790
嘅噉，我哋就希望漁護署咧都會定期監察翻呢啲嘅唔同嘅垃圾啦，對於海底嘅環境嘅影響啦，誒同埋去舉辦多啲嘅海底清理活動，去減少翻呢啲垃圾嘅情況。咁第三就係誒要進一步去減少翻啲垃圾進入海洋嘅情況咧。咁海事處就需要去重新檢視翻佢哋去。

46
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:25,800
去喺誒船隻去收集家居垃圾嘅規模同埋力度，去平衡翻收集啲垃圾同埋喺海上去清理垃圾嘅成本效益嘅。咁最屘一點就係即係需要向翻誒需要檢討翻我哋誒海事署向海洋使用者去傳達一啲海洋清潔信息嘅工作效益啦。因

47
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:45,810
因為見到佢都好，即係一路以嚟都有好多工作去宣傳噉，但係個誒海洋垃圾情況依然嚴重噉，就希望可以即係改善翻，去帶出一個正面嘅轉變。你有冇啲倒垃圾嘅黑點可以話到畀政府聽，等我哋去hold住啊？誒，其實我哋世界自然基金會都一路去誒做緊一個調。

48
00:11:45,810 --> 00:12:05,820
查啦，叫飼養海洋計劃噉就去全香港唔同嘅地方都去收集緊啲數據嘅。噉就未有一個好即係好確實嘅嘅一個建議，話誒究竟邊一個地方係最多咁？但係我哋喺譬如香港仔啦、長洲啦，同埋嚟緊都會喺大澳去誒做翻一啲調查嘅。

49
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:14,370
係咯，咁即係即係請海事處都留意翻嗰啲地方啊嘛。So the the next speaker would be the Mrs. Jo Wilson of Living Nama, please.

50
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,630
yes okay sorry。

51
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:41,500
Good afternoon. Living Llama has been cleaning beaches for six years, and so we are intimately acquainted with the garbage that washes up on our shores. We not only collect the trash, but we sort it, we count it, and we observe what likely human activity has caused it, and also how the marine life is feeding on it.

52
00:12:41,780 --> 00:13:01,790
The amount of trash is overwhelming and refuse from shipping is no doubt a major contributor. We made one beach on the north side of Lamma the focus of a year-long study. As well as general litter, refuse specific to shipping activities include oil cans, pumps, oily rags, fishing floats, polystyrene boxes, netting, fishing line, clothing.

53
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:11,560
牙刷、打火機，和任何其他 unwanted item，包括，我 sorry to say，黃色塑料袋，發出由海洋部發出，滿滿的垃圾。

54
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:21,680
我們 receive daily news stories from various other groups around the world that are investigating and trying to do something about the global disaster that is plastic in our oceans.

55
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:40,440
它不是一個只識識別黑點的問題，這是現在全世界都在發生。我們相信，在香港，就像在其他地方一樣，大多數問題是由習慣造成，加上缺乏基本的環境知識和缺乏服務，來讓市民能夠輕易地負責任處理他們產生的廢棄物。

56
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:59,490
last year for the Hong Kong clean up we cleaned the beach in Yung Shue Wan every day for 42 days. We took off around five tons of construction waste and as we sorted through layer upon layer of historical dumping, it became clear to us that it was normal practice to throw unwanted items into the sea.

57
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:12,010
this begs the question: if the public see government departments allowing our natural landscape to become and then remain blighted, how can we expect ordinary people to behave any differently?

58
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:25,970
我們已敦促環境部秘書長宣佈海洋中的垃圾為災難。畢竟，如果塑膠是其前處理形式的油，它就會被視為如此。

59
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,770
declaring a disaster would show leadership and focus people's minds on the seriousness of the problem.

60
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:52,200
It is very disappointing to find that the government's recent study concludes that marine refuse does not constitute a serious problem in Hong Kong. This directly contradicts the findings of a 1997 survey by the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society, funded by the ECF, which found that marine debris posed a serious pollution threat to

61
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,950
香港的marine environment。

62
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:04,410
for our group and other organisations that have spent years working on the problem, marine trash is very serious indeed. Devastating would be a more accurate description.

63
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:25,170
如果 panel is in any doubt, please arrange a site visit to Lapsat Wan with the Coastal Watch members. There is nothing like the experience of standing on a mountain of trash on a beach to focus people on the urgency of this problem, except perhaps actually trying to clean it up again and again, sorting it, counting it, recording it.

64
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:32,380
only to see it coming back in alarming quantities, and we do this experience with our children, and the children see it also.

65
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:52,920
在垃圾山案，的絕大多數垃圾似乎來自於運輸。作為緊縮立法，資源需要被部署以執行法律，以教育和溝通，創意和有效，所以人們受到鼓舞改變他們的習慣。這不是關於責備或推卸責任。

66
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:04,430
但關於提升標準和Setting好例子，我們希望政府可以 respond正向地到呢個挑戰。 now我係想，我有三分鐘，如果我見到鐘。

67
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:24,960
我講slowly，但係我do want to just add that a simple Google search online，if you look for ocean marine trash plastic in the ocean，you'll find newspaper headlines from around the world reporting on how 8 million tons of plastic are dumped in the ocean every year。Of course，it's

68
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:44,970
Impossible to really count it, but this problem is not just about Hong Kong. Everywhere from the Arctic down to Australia, from the the west coast of America across to Asia, we just have not kept up with the amount of trash we're producing and the ways in which we can process this trash.

69
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,190
the other end.

70
00:16:46,720 --> 00:17:06,730
on the cigarette front, the the government's report says that cigarettes are not a serious problem, or trash from cigarettes is not a serious problem. We found this when we first started cleaning beaches. You tend to pick up the big stuff, the stuff that's easy to pick up. But actually, what we've learned from cleaning beaches that

71
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:26,740
Look clean is that it's the microplastics, the tiny bits of plastics that are on the on the seashore. When we clean the beach in Yangshuoan every day for forty two days, we picked up almost three thousand cigarette butts. That's twenty three thousand cigarette butts in one year. If you multiply it out, just

72
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:36,770
from one small beach, and we see people habitually just dropping the cigarette butts on the floor, and they're getting into the storm drains and going out to sea. People don't think twice about it.

73
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,490
估計，世界每年被丟棄的煙蒂是4.5兆。

74
00:17:44,770 --> 00:18:04,780
And these are toxic. They contain plastics, and this is getting into the food chain. We now have pictures, documentaries that are now looking at plankton and are seeing the plastic. They're going into the plankton. We have fish that are having plastics taken out of their bellies, and bird life that are dying because.

75
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:24,790
They have a belly full of plastic. In fact, a few weeks ago, I held a bag of plastic that had come out of a young albatross. And if you are in any doubt whatsoever of the seriousness of this problem, I invite you to please come take a look, or just you know find those sources, find those experts that have.

76
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:44,800
這材料，and it will certainly open your eyes. So that's all I've got to say. I do have files. This is a very strange environment to talk about beaches, as we're nowhere near a beach. But I have files. I've got pictures. We've documented everything. If anyone wants further information, I'm very happy to share it.

77
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,320
Thank you. Thank you. So the next speaker will be Ms. Lewis Preston from the Living Islands Movement, please.

78
00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:03,660
Living Islands Movement welcomes this subcommittee's initiative in seeking an active and vigilant approach to preventing and reducing the accumulation of marine refuse on Hong Kong's beaches.

79
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:18,330
The measures currently in place, such as the refuse collection service for vessels at anchorage and typhoon shelters, marine scavenging, and the current publicity and education measures, don't seem to be adequate.

80
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:32,670
廢棄物積累在我們的海灘是香港面臨的更廣泛的廢棄物管理危機的一部分，需要從根本上解決，通過徹底的廢棄物分類、減少和回收措施。

81
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:41,980
The Marine Department's primary interest in marine littering seems to be to ensure safe navigation for vessels in Hong Kong waters.

82
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:59,220
然而，保護和保存我們的海灘是個更廣泛的議題，和一個挑戰是數量不同的政府部門在應對這個問題中扮演的角色，包括EPD、FEHD、LCSD和土地部門以及數個其他部門。

83
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:14,570
一更 holistic reproach is is required rather than allocating responsibility for different parts of the shoreline to different departments, depending on whether it is above or below the high tide line and whether the refuse is found in the water or on the land.

84
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:26,400
It doesn't help to tackle or solve the problem to be more concerned about different labels and classifications, such as whether it's land waste derived or marine derived, rather than dealing with the rubbish itself.

85
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:41,430
The establishment of the government's interdepartmental working group on clean shorelines was a welcome step in the right direction, but perhaps this group needs to be given wideranging responsibilities and accountabilities.

86
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:48,650
例如，implementing the coastal protection zone and systematic cleaning of non-gazetted beaches.

87
00:20:49,800 --> 00:21:09,810
at present, the reports and studies commissioned by the government, such as the recent one issued by Mott Macdonald, tell a very different story from what we are seeing on our local beaches with our own eyes. So there is a gap between the government's perception of the problem and the reality that those of us who live near beaches see every day.

88
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:31,000
而家嘅情況係重疊嘅部門責任，唔係解決問題。任何真係有決心嘅努力去解決香港嘅海洋污染，亦都需要同澳門、SAR同中國一齊合作，睇下整個污染嘅來源喺珠江三角洲。

89
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,680
作為單一實體。

90
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,260
Thank you.

91
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,740
Well，誒官員有冇誒即時嘅回應？

92
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,860
如果冇咧，我就請委員提問啦，陳偉業議員。

93
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,890
只得我一個可以問完就問你，今日今日可以隨心所欲啊！有有成大半個鐘頭。

94
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:19,180
嗱嗱，主席，我我希望在座嘅誒嘉賓咧可以講講，因為委員會審議有關條例嘅時候，特別討論到有關海面海上垃圾嘅時候咧，就往往即係誒有一個情況就係，即係海事處就表明咧有好多關於海上垃圾嘅問題就與佢無關嘅，啊，即係。

95
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:39,190
佢喺船上抌垃圾，呢個就簡易注註條例，就唔係海事處有關呢個船隻規管嘅範圍。咁啲垃圾上到岸咧，就係呢個食環處嘅責任，亦都同海事處冇乜責任。咁海上嘅垃圾你哋做啦。噉我哋就指出兩個大，即係其實三個大嘅問題啦。一個就即係我自己嘅經驗咧，包括。

96
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:59,200
我喺多次清理海灘垃圾嘅時候咧，都係發現啲海上嘅垃圾咧，明顯係船上抌落嚟嘅。一來就係啲黑垃圾嘅種類啦。啊，我一次都多次講過，即係我連避孕套我都見過嘅啊。噉啊，啲針筒啊，針筒就好危險嘅。每一次去咧，都有新嘅針筒喺海灘嘅。呢個係經常出現嘅情。

97
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:19,210
情況即係我自己就懷疑誒船上啲水手或者誒在誒遊客又好，水手又好啦嚇，或者係啲誒遊艇都好啦，就唔少人係誒有呢個誒用毒品嘅習慣。噉佢哋避免呢一個即係被呢個插拿或者被呢個拘捕咧，一用完咪即等啦，用完即棄啦，好簡單。

98
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:39,220
咁變咗呢個誒，即係經過嘅船隻抌落海咧，就浮咗上嚟。咁同埋大魚南對出咧，係一條最頻密嘅即係嘅誒，即係海船隻行嘅航道嚟嘅。咁嗰度早午晚都好多船嘅。噉你抌垃圾軍冇可能可以。

99
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:59,230
即係捉到嘅係嘛？啲船又快，同埋撳啲嘢又細，夾埋夾埋咪一日一啲一隻一啲捉埋捉埋咪好多咯。咁呢個情況，我覺得係船隻特別大魚南出現嘅誒，即係垃圾咧就好明顯係船隻抌出嚟嘅，但係睇唔到海事處有啲乜嘢計劃。咁第二個問題就係清。

100
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:19,240
你岸上嘅垃圾啊，呢個即係好多團體同食環處好多投訴㗎啦。咁投訴一次佢就清一次，你唔投訴佢就唔理。咁呢個情況係出現嘅。第三就海上垃圾清理啦。咁呢次都上一次都講過，即係你用嗰啲船總嘅做法同埋清理垃圾嘅做法，似乎就唔係好現代化，即係亦都即係。

101
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:39,250
並非香港應有嘅水平啦，咁所以呢三個問題，咁都希望誒啲嘉賓咧誒可以就翻呢個佢哋認為海啲垃佢哋所處理啲垃圾或者見到啲垃圾嘅來源係點，同埋佢哋期望政府有啲咩改善咧，可以畀一啲意見。嚇，你你想？

102
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:59,260
兩三位都問曬嚇，有時間啫，冇乜所謂。Would any representative want to question my question? You know, mainly that you get my question. Okay, good. Yeah. Okay. Maybe, maybe I could start. Well, we've as as a local group, we have.

103
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:19,270
put in a hundred reports to government on the subject of waste and development, focusing on Lamma Island. And so we've looked at how people behave both on land and on on the shoreline with regard to waste. One of the difficulties that that we we are facing is

104
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:39,280
that there is a probably historical view of LAPSAP which comes from many many years ago when there wasn't quite so much LAPSAP in the world and things were much simpler, so that you know you just have a bin and people would put the waste.

105
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:59,290
It's the same everywhere else in the world. Now, what we find is when we have a problem with rubbish, littering, dumping, it is very difficult as a member of the public to fix this problem, so that our schoolchildren, our kids, do not see the grown-ups just throwing litter everywhere or just leaving litter everywhere, because when once

106
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:19,300
litter is left in our community, that becomes the normal standard. And the difficulty is this: that rubbish is not rubbish as far as policy is concerned. It depends on what kind of rubbish it is and where it lies, who deals with it. If it is on the path or near the bins, FEH.

107
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:32,800
FED會 pick it up， and in fact, FED being operational and hands on, they have been absolutely outstanding in supporting us on cleaning up our beaches. When we first started, and we showed them a picture.

108
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:53,090
of the beach on the north side of Lamma, the local officer said, "Oh, Mrs. Wilson, who put that there? It's terrible. Who's dumped that on the beach?" And when I said it came from the sea, he looked at me in disbelief and said, "No way!" But actually, then he came and he learnt with us because cleaning a beach is a learning experience, and we have.

109
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:13,100
found that there is no jurisdictional divide for rubbish. It does not stay in one place. We also find it can get cleaned up easily if, for example, drainage services has a worksite and the worksite used to look like rubbish tips. You could not tell the difference until we engage with drainage services.

110
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:33,110
services and they responded very positively, and then they will keep their worksite clean and tidy. But not all government departments behave like that. Some water services, district office, their contractors will come and will habitually throw their rubbish, even before we started our year-long.

111
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:53,120
長度研究的北岸，Lamma，和我們實際上稱這個研究為「品牌在海灘」，因為我們計數了海灘上的塑膠水瓶。經過一次去海灘，我們發現900個塑膠水瓶。從一個小海灘，我們決定一年計數它們，並命名品牌。我們猜測，而且猜測正確，

112
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:07,920
The number one brand on the beach would be the same brand that we saw government contractors getting, because what we saw was that they would take one or two sips from the bottle of water and then throw it into the underground growth or leave it behind. This comes from a culture where

113
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:28,210
People think it's somebody else's responsibility to pick up after them, and this is the thing that we really have to address. You know, I'm trying to do it with my children. There's a lot of other people that are trying to do it in the schools, but so many people have helpers. So many people do not even see the rubbish that comes into their house.

114
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:48,220
and it miraculously goes away, or they put it on the ground and FEHD will come and clean it up. We see in the community, we've tried to engage with the police to enforce the law on littering, and all we got was to be passed from one department to another, and it just goes round and around. So this

115
00:28:48,220 --> 00:29:08,230
This makes it very, very difficult to tackle the problem at source because there is no one authority that is saying, you know what, we've got to change our habits because we really have to change the way that we accept lapsap into our lives, and then we process it.

116
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:28,240
And if it's something that we cannot process and is ending up in the sea, like for instance polystyrene, perhaps we should think of other ways of of getting the things that we want without producing so much rubbish. It is very problematic, particularly with government departments that are not.

117
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:48,250
operational and in the community, because with the best will in the world, if you're sitting at an office far away and you've got so many different things coming into your desk, it is very very difficult to connect with actually what's on the ground. And in fact, the first time we reported the bags full of trash, the marine department bags full of

118
00:29:48,250 --> 00:30:05,290
trash to the marine department. Their response was no way. We we spend our time cleaning up rubbish, and I know that they do. They spend a lot of time, and they were absolutely horrified and and couldn't believe that they were ending up on our beach. But but they are, and it's only through the efforts of

119
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:25,580
Local green groups and a lot of the school children are going out now and cleaning up. That these these things are coming coming to people's into people's vision. But the idea that it's the jurisdiction stops and the the rubbish will stop is is is just not happening.

120
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,920
好，有冇其他代表？係。

121
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:51,020
係誒，其實我哋世界自然基金會咧都好似頭先咁講啦，都發現咗海事處其實誒，又或者係其他嘅執法部門啦，喺誒近年嗰個誒對於海上拋置廢物嗰個情況嗰個執法嘅即係嗰個檢控數字咧，係比起以前係低。

122
00:30:51,020 --> 00:31:11,030
有好多嘅，噉就即係我哋就唔可以話，誒一口咬定你一定嗰個嗰個執法嘅力度係低咗。咁但係誒，即係都好希望海事處或者有關當局都可以去解釋翻個數字點解會係即係誒低咗咁多啊？會唔會係哦？其實啲人偷偷地去抌咗，你係根本點揾都唔～

123
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:31,040
會揾到啊？定係其實誒，即係可能你哋巡邏嘅時候誒，嗰個即係冇咁專注去揾翻嗰啲即係海上垃拋棄垃圾嘅情況啊，噉樣咁都希望當局可以解釋翻個數字啦。咁誒，同埋就好明顯，我哋睇到咧，香港仔嗰度即係雖然政府都會即係持續。

124
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:51,050
喺嗰度去做一啲執法行動啦。咁但係嗰個誒情況咧，一路都冇改善，即係每每日都依然可以執到好多嘅海洋垃圾。咁誒，其實如果喺香港仔個避風塘入面咁細嘅地方都唔能夠做到有效執法，噉樣其實我哋亦都唔需要去講話喺大嶼山南部嗰度。

125
00:31:51,050 --> 00:32:11,060
究竟點樣去執法啊？嗰啲係啦，噉就即係希望由呢啲誒最密集或者最嚴重嘅地方可以開始去誒加強翻呢啲嘅誒執法行動啦。咁另外即係當然都好似頭先去強調翻啦，其實我哋覺得誒都誒個教育工作、宣傳工作咧都係好重要嘅，即係你去執法。

126
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:31,070
其實即係你有無限隻船，你先至可以即係控檢控到無限嘅嘅一啲唔合守法嘅人。咁但係即係我哋如果去用個教育個角度去做咧，咁其實就可以即係令到嗰啲人亦都可以互相影響翻，去即係更加正面噉樣去改善啲海洋垃圾問題嘅。咁誒，我哋都希望啦，可。

127
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:51,080
好似處可能亦都可以誒，同我哋一啲唔同嘅誒NGO啊，或者係漁民啊，或者唔同嘅公司咧，都去合作下，或者去誒一齊去分享下究竟誒而家現行去做緊嗰啲宣傳嘅工作誒嗰個詳情係點樣咁睇下，即係大家一齊合作睇下會誒會可以點樣去改善翻。

128
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,050
嘅情況啦。

129
00:32:52,750 --> 00:33:12,760
咁誒，另外咧，關於嗰個即係巡查翻唔同嘅誒海洋垃圾黑點嗰方面啦。咁其實喺誒環保署上個月中去公佈嘅一個報告，咁都有講過咧。誒海事處就會喺誒颱風之後咧，就會加強去巡查翻一啲唔同嘅海上誒。

130
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:32,770
即係海洋垃圾嘅黑點啊！即係譬如一啲唔同嘅海岸比較偏遠啲，可能颱風會打咗好多嘅垃圾上岸嘅。咁誒，即係呢個當然係一個非常之好嘅措施啦。咁但係誒，其實喺颱風季節以外嘅情況咧，即係譬如有尤其是係誒有季後風嘅時候啦，亦都會有好嚴重嘅。

131
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:52,780
垃圾嘅堆積上岸上面嘅情況嘅噉，所以就希望誒海事處啦，或者係其他嘅即係會用到船嘅一啲政府部門啦，譬如係水警啊、漁護署啊等等嘅部門咧，都可以喺平時嘅一啲巡查，即係即使唔係專責去誒巡查啲海上垃圾嘅情況嘅時。

132
00:33:52,780 --> 00:34:07,180
然後咧，亦都可以監察翻唔同嘅地方，究竟佢會唔會有啲誒嚴重嘅垃圾堆積嘅情況咧？就唔係等到要有市民去主動舉報，或者係誒有颱風打到嚟嘅時候咧，先至去主動去巡查嘅。

133
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:27,470
咁誒第三點咧，就係即係嗰個海底垃圾嘅情況啦。咁其實因為誒環保署最近去公佈嘅一個調查嘅結果咧，其實佢所有嘅調查咧都係針對翻海面上嘅垃圾啦，同埋岸上嘅垃圾嘅。咁但係其實啲海洋垃圾咧，亦都有好多嘅部分咧係。

134
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:47,480
沉咗海底噉，譬如頭先有提過嘅一啲拖網啊，或者係其他嘅漁具啊，甚至乎係一啲簡單嘅家居廢物啊，可能有啲風扇啊、冷氣機啊，我哋有時候都會喺海底入面見到嘅。噉我哋亦都希望誒，即係誒，譬如漁護署啦，或者其他有關嘅部門咧，都可以去審。

135
00:34:47,480 --> 00:35:07,490
審視翻呢啲海底垃圾嗰個情況，去研究翻究竟佢哋嗰個誒，即係喺香港嘅分佈啦，誒同埋佢哋對於誒香港嘅環境嘅影響嘅，就唔係純粹喺誒有珊瑚區嘅地方，漁護署先至去誒主動去做翻一啲清理工作。噉我哋即係可以更加。

136
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,340
全面噉樣去處理翻香港嘅海洋垃圾問題。

137
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:17,790
And Mr. Lewis Preston, you have anything to add to the response to the Honourable Albert Chan?

138
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:38,080
Like Patrick and Joe, our anecdotal evidence is also that the majority of the waste that we find on the beaches and shoreline is marine-based. I think it's it's really not very helpful to use these specific categories. It's rubbish on the beach. Yes, of course we need to understand where it comes from. But one of the difficulties, as I said.

139
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,280
是定義責任範圍，之間的政府部門，對於垃圾是實際發現。

140
00:35:44,560 --> 00:36:00,010
And if it, even if it's been in the water at one time, inevitably it ends up on the shoreline in mangrove swamps or on our wetlands, and then it's not the responsibility of the marine department. And I think that these these this labelling is really not at all helpful.

141
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:20,300
Certainly, some of the beaches on South Land海that have the worst rubbish problem. For example, Shoehaiwan, which is predominantly mangrove, an area of of immense interest from a zoological point of view because there are I think three endangered species on that bay, and also Lokeiwan.

142
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:34,220
The rubbish there is without a doubt marine refuse, but it's on the shoreline, and I think this labelling is one of the problems that is seeing this problem growing and not being tackled in in an appropriate manner.

143
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,520
官員有冇回應啊？呢一刻。

144
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,810
噉就係頭先誒幾位嘉賓有幾樣嘢，我想有啲回應嘅。

145
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,250
其實咧，我哋都誒。

146
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,330
非常多謝嗰啲誒。

147
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:56,690
環保團體，佢哋就啲誒，畀到一啲資料喺佢哋清潔岸灘嘅時候。

148
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,270
咁頭先有提到咧，就係誒。

149
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,650
我哋海事處派畀一啲船隻裝垃圾嘅膠袋咧，被發現喺沙灘上邊。

150
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:15,760
咁咧就誒好多謝Mr. Wilson就畀，其實之前佢都係誒畀多幾次誒電郵就提我哋呢樣嘢嘅。

151
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,430
咁其實上呢樣嘢咧，我哋咧係都幾關注。

152
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,960
我哋發覺呢啲所謂嘅垃圾袋裝住垃圾咧。

153
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,370
嗱，過往係一共有三件。

154
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,440
有一件咧，就包住一件救生衣，船用嘅救生衣。

155
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:49,730
有一件咧就包住一啲誒，好似零件同埋一啲一啲誒單據一啲receipt一啲單據。最近一件咧就包住啲潤滑劑同埋啲一啲誒污糟嘅一啲一啲油布。咁呢個咧其實咧我哋都誒，其實亦都多謝啊Jo Wilson畀到。

156
00:37:49,730 --> 00:38:09,740
啲資料我哋咧，其實我哋咧嚟緊咧，其實會針對一啲船、一啲修理船廠啊，因為我覺得呢啲咧未必係一般嘅家居垃圾，似乎係啲船廠啊嗰啲或者修理廠啊點樣棄置出嚟，我哋就唔唔，總之呢樣嘢最後係落咗海或者上咗岸㗎啦。噉我哋會嚟緊，我哋會做多啲呢啲噉嘅。

157
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,930
宣傳活動嘅。

158
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,870
誒，至於執法方面咧，其實我哋有注意到嘅。

159
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,460
近年嘅數字咧，其實係即係成功檢控嘅個案係跌得好緊要嘅。

160
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,970
係。誒，好坦白講，我哋其實執法嘅次數啊，係比前多咗嘅。

161
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:37,420
尤其近年，我哋更加係多咗，尤其是香港仔避風塘。其實嗰個係一個係黑點嚟嘅，個的確係一個黑點嚟嘅。噉，尤其是個幼兒市場。

162
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:43,620
其實我哋不時咧就會同魚市場，其實我哋過去差唔多係每個月都一次。

163
00:38:43,900 --> 00:39:01,060
同魚市場嗰啲職員合作一齊咧，就去嗰個魚市場去做一啲宣傳。其實宣傳之前咧，我哋一定會喺嗰度咧就佈一輪嘅，睇下捉唔捉到。其實過去舊年即係一四年，有幾張票都係響誒魚市場嗰度誒即係告嘅。

164
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:21,800
咁誒，香港製的確係一個問題，但係我哋都係非常之重點對香港製餅工堂係做好多嘢嚟緊。我哋都會做更多嘅嘢，但執法數字減少咧，其實我哋都即係好想，我都想知道點解。但係我哋發覺好奇怪現象，其實執法數字近年少咗咧，其實海上垃圾海事處執法嘅。

165
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,760
個案咧就多數同煙頭有關嘅。自從禁煙之後咧。

166
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:37,810
就啲人係食煙係少咗嘅，即係呢個係少咗嘅，因為大部分佢都係一啲誒，唔係話全部，但係相當一部分呢啲過往嘅幾本數字都係嚟自抌煙頭落海嘅。

167
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,170
咁誒呢幾年咧，呢個數字係減咗好多。

168
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,280
噉我哋而家咧，其實咧，我哋都係誒。

169
00:39:46,530 --> 00:40:00,360
多做多咗，係咪因為我哋誒？我哋會校？係咪因為誒？簡單講，啲人抌垃圾人精咗，係嘛？噉我哋都希望誒喺呢方面都加強啲執法。仲有一個就係船上抌垃圾。

170
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:13,890
咁誒，我哋發覺以前我哋收嗰啲舉報係船台打垃圾，但係非常之難舉證，因為報案嘅人咧未必知道個船嗰個船名或者冧碼或者所謂船牌嘅號碼嗰啲咧。

171
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:27,410
令到我哋咧就好難再揾到證據，真係捉成檢控。噉我哋嚟緊咧，我哋會印一啲宣傳單張，就畀啲公眾人士，就幫佢哋辨認。如果見到只船抌垃圾，佢辨認只船嗰啲。

172
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:39,060
啲宣傳單係咪講緊咧？個船嘅註冊號碼印響邊度嘅？佢能夠記住呢個號碼，或者記住個船名，咁嚟到通知翻我哋，就幫我哋去做一啲跟進嘅嘢。

173
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,320
咁呢個都係即係嚟緊，我哋誒即係希望喺執法上係做多啲嘢嘅。

174
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,130
至於誒嗰個誒。

175
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:55,930
我哋嗰個所謂加強巡邏嗰度咧，其實我想誒講清楚啲咧，主要颱風個加強巡邏咧，就唔係話因為颱風。

176
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:14,300
誒，知道嗱，大家知道颱風季節之後會好多垃圾會積堆積埋嘅。但係咧，我哋一般市一般人所講就係落完八號風球咧，就叫做打完風啦。咁其實仲有海面咧，就算三號風球打完風就係三號風球，維持一段好長嘅時間嘅。

177
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:23,420
咁呢個時候咧，其實我啲船係唔喐得嘅。過往咧，我哋都係等到一路風球或者就嚟落曬波，先嚟派船出去巡嘅。

178
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,540
噉樣咧，可能咧就海面堆出垃圾，啲市民已經好多電話啊、電郵入嚟舉報㗎啦。

179
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,750
噉我哋希望咧，喺呢種情況之下咧，我哋會派啲同事坐車由六路。

180
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,100
就主要就沿住維港兩岸。

181
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:54,350
就係如果發現有垃圾積聚嘅話咧，我會即時記錄低。到個天氣一轉翻，譬如一號風球或者個海面平靜之後咧，我哋嘅垃圾船就即時去嗰度做清理。咁咧，希望誒減少啲時間。呢個係我哋其中一個。另外一個就係一啲誒。

182
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:03,120
一啲high season，譬如話一啲遊艇啊，比較多煩嘅開始遊艇季節嘅時候咧，我哋會加強一啲，譬如話啲遊艇。

183
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:23,750
經常去嘅一啲一啲一一啲一啲一啲沙灘啊，嗰啲未必一定係誒欠步巷燈，可能有啲誒西貢，可能有啲灣噉。噉我哋會加強嗰度嘅巡邏，就因為誒人旅遊人多咗，咁船隻活動多咗，我哋覺得垃圾亦都可能會多咗。噉我哋會加強啲嗰邊嘅巡邏，呢啲就係我哋嚟緊，即係希望。

184
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,480
當嘅。

185
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:33,190
做嘅嘢嚟嘅，咁誒至於誒另外一個就係講緊誒，尤其是香港製避風塘呢個都比較嚴重，就嗰啲誒化保膠嗰啲。

186
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:53,480
咁其實好多垃圾，我發覺就唔係人出意抌落去嘅。其實好多時候因為話放置嘅問題，尤其是嗰啲化保膠箱。咁呢樣嘢咧，其實我一路一路都同誒漁即係漁市場嘅嘅工作人員啦，同埋啲漁民一路都其實我啲的確見到啲膠箱咧喺漁市場嗰個個碼頭邊或者喺漁船上面冧到好高，風一陣吹埋嚟咧就會跌落。

187
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,100
我相信佢又唔會咁得閒，即係執翻佢嘅。

188
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:03,480
最後都都係，如果我即係由我我哋去執嘅咧，最後都係咁呢樣嘢，我哋都希望即係多啲響宣傳方面就同佢。

189
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,730
誒。

190
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:16,310
儘量叫佢哋唔好，同埋我哋都呼籲誒，即係魚，其實魚市場佢一路都有做緊，就擺多垃圾桶喺度，因為佢啲嗰啲膠箱裝完魚獲爛咗咧，就唔好就咁劈喺嗰個。

191
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:23,750
嗰個岸邊，因為好容易吹落海，嗰啲好輕，就希望佢揾垃圾桶放好佢。咁呢個就都係我哋誒。

192
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,320
做嘅嘢嚟嘅。

193
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,390
嚇，噉。

194
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:35,150
啊！我嘅回應集齊咁多先。好，有冇其他委員提問？啊，黃碧雲議員。

195
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:58,250
係話你，如果話嗰啲發佈交商咧，即係佢哋因為誒嗰啲漁民又好，或者作業嘅人都好，佢哋冇固定佢咁吹咗落海，咁咁又唔執就等翻你執。我想問佢噉樣算唔算？如果佢冇做誒足夠嘅措施去防止呢啲物品跌落海。

196
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:18,260
啊！即係製造咗垃圾，其實你法例上邊即係如果有人影到嘅有證據嘅，你就係可以檢控㗎嘛，係嘛？即係佢當喺海度拋垃圾。暫時法例冇冇呢樣嘢嘅，即係法例上邊冇嘅。法例嗰個誒嗰個所謂簡易治進條例四D嗰度咧，就係佢將垃圾抌落海或者抌喺一個地方嗰啲潮水。

197
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,320
佢漲退可以沖落海嘅，先為之犯法嘅。

198
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:31,960
唔明啊？點樣？即係如果有人蓄意抌啲嘢落海嗰度，誒抌煙頭又好，或者抌發泡膠箱，無論佢有意或者無意都好，都告唔到佢嘅。

199
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:52,250
我哋話抌落海，而家嘅法例係抌落直接抌落海，直接抌落海或者抌喺一啲岸邊，係令到潮水漲退可以將佢沖落海嘅，咁先為之叫做誒誒違法。咁如果佢喺如果佢係擺一個岸度而風吹落去嘅，咁暫時呢條呢條法例係冇呢樣嘢嘅。即係誒咁可能即係我諗阿主席。

200
00:44:52,250 --> 00:45:12,260
可能我哋要跟咧，就話可能係咪法例有漏洞？因為如果啲人即係疏忽誒，唔理自己嘅物品，任佢隨風吹咗落海，咁其實佢都係冇做到佢應該就係要保持海港潔淨。嗯，我我理解係你隨處抌煙頭咧。如果你喺陸上抌一千五百定額罰款。

201
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:32,270
一拉走，即係你阿鄭生係咪講緊你海事處範圍裏邊嘅法例冇？唔係呢一條法例，其實誒簡言之，條例都唔係海事係食環處嘅食環處長嘅呢條例。不過海事係其中一個執握手權執行，就係誒條例嘅四D。嗯，即係話而家個法例個問題就係話誒，而家指出嚟就係話。

202
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:52,280
你蓄意抌嘢落去就唔得啦，但係而家你唔係蓄意抌落去，但係你咧就係蓄意唔理嗰啲嘢，令到嗰啲嘢跌咗落海，咁嗰度就冇法例規管，係咪咁講？我哋嗱法例就冇出意，但係講緊嗰個廢物如果棄置入海，或者去一啲一啲地方，可以令到潮水將佢沖落海嘅，即係。

203
00:45:52,280 --> 00:46:12,290
舉例，譬如話誒一啲一啲岸邊啦、一駁邊啦、水仗水堆可以跟住衝出海嘅，噉就為之犯法。但係條例就冇講話蓄意或者唔蓄意嘅。我我同阿鄭生有唔同嘅角度理解，因為我哋一路講緊好多都係煙頭。我理解咧，你通道掉煙頭咧，食環處埋你就一千五百蚊㗎啦嚇。

204
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:26,180
即係，但係呢個就唔係海事處個執法範圍。噉啊，我理解鄭生頭先講緊咧，就係譬如嗰啲捉魚嘅發泡膠，即係漁船用嚟裝魚嘅發泡膠，如果係擺咗喺岸上。

205
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,240
誒或者樹葉吹咗落海，係啦，讓佢哋沖咗落海，然後再沖翻上岸。

206
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:52,530
就有問題啦。啊，唔係唔係，其實我意思係話，其實誒，而家有啲法寶膠箱喺水度出現咧，就唔係畀人故意抌落海。其實佢因為佢喺岸度放置得唔好，而畀風吹咗落海。咁呢個情況咧就話誒，其實誒，如果講呢個誒，而家嗰個簡易船。

207
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,420
條例海葬棄置垃圾嗰條條例咧，呢一個咧係誒。

208
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:16,880
即係唔係受呢呢條條例係係冇呢一樣嘢，管制呢樣嘢咯。我啲就當你擺咗樣嘢喺岸邊，畀風吹咗落海就天意啦，你都有損失噉就就冇一條法例就話你冇固定嗰啲發泡膠箱，等佢唔好跌落海呢樣嘢。但係如果我哋講煙頭啊嗰啲咧，你喺邊度抌都一千五百。

209
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,860
百㗎啦，係嘛？

210
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:38,150
即係即係呢個係我嘅理解啊，易志明議員。主席，大家講緊唔同嘅嘢咧。你親眼睇到佢掟煙頭，就梗係一千五百蚊啦，唔使講啦。睇唔到你都捉唔到啊嘛。睇唔到無人認領啦，嗰個就係啦。嗱咁而家我我聽得啊，處長咪即係即係處嘅講法咧，即係而家法例係唔包我擺咗個發佈架喺度。

211
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:58,160
佢吹咗落海就唔關我事啦，因為唔係我觸耳抌落去啊嘛。唔係唔關我事，我嘅意思係嗰條法。你你唔可以用嗰條條例執法啦。係我哋而家就做緊啲嘢，去到希望佢哋能夠做好啲，唔好畀啲發保瓜咁易吹落海。明白係噉，你用咩方法嚟令到佢會早啲咧？嗱，其實我哋我哋差唔多每個月我哋都會去。

212
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:18,170
譬如市場同呢個，明白嘅，即係教育同勸喻啦。教育同勸喻嗱，我啊想舉個例啊，啊主席誒香香港而家有條條例嘅誒。如果你屋企嗰個女窗你唔去處理得好咧，啊你一開個窗卜一聲跌落去咧，對唔住喎，閣下有刑責㗎喎嚇。

213
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:38,180
即係嗱，或者又舉個例，你喺街唔知喺邊度咧，有啲僭建嘅嘢，僭建本身都違法先啦。咁咪就佢唔安全嘅，啊跌落嚟甩砸親人。喂，嗰個嗰個擁有者都有刑責嘅喎，係嘛？即係而家你個問題就話呢個情況咧，你哋就冇辦法用簡易條例去執法啦。噉我就真係睇到係有個漏洞嘅，咁應該係咪？

214
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:55,920
誒誒，局方去翻去睇睇，而家呢條條例咪你即係個法則嗰度啊，係咪可以將佢嚴緊少少？即係你有個責任去管好你應有嘅嘢嚟防止佢因任何嘅理由跌咗落海而產生海上嘅廢物咧？咁即係我諗要研究下呢樣嘢啦。

215
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,310
係。

216
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,520
噉啊，阿陳小姐，你聽到議員個意見啦嚇，就帶翻去啦。

217
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:16,240
好啊！誒唔該，主席，我或者會同環保署，因為嗰條條例都唔係誒運房局嘅，不過我哋會將個意見即係同環保署再傾，或者係誒轉交翻畀相關嘅局去考慮咯。

218
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:36,770
係陳偉業議員，即係我覺得當然頭先啊葉志明即係建議嗰個係好建議咧，我都支持咧。即係究竟誒係用我我我覺得係用呢個嘅環境衞生條例較為恰當嘅，即係你擺一啲嘢喺度誒，你冇適當管理，我唔理喺海上跌落海，或者係喺呢個。

219
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:56,780
船隻跌落海都構成一個嘅環境嘅問題噉，噉我覺得呢個法例上係食環多啲嘅，咁至於個法例點改咁睇佢哋局方面即係再研究啦。咁但係我覺得頭先講咗咁多嘅問題咧，單單淨係呢一個改善，我覺得係唔足夠嘅。咁當然即係海事處答應加強呢一個嘅教育宣。

220
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:16,790
存咧呢個我歡迎咧，咁但係即係香港呢個問題，其實過去二三十年即係不斷存在嘅。誒有啲地方係改善咗嘅，我承認。特別喺避風塘，如果你同翻即係二三十年前比咧，家下嗰個污染程度相對地係改善，但係仍然有頭先所講啲發佈家話，其他啲問題仍然存在嘅。

221
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:36,800
咁呢個睇佢點樣教育同埋檢控，我覺得加強檢控係有幫助嘅。我多年前都建議睇下話會唔會喺呢個嘅適當地方安裝多啲天眼，即係誒記錄低多啲嘅行為係嘛？即係我記得我喺九十年代，我已經建議喺荃灣海岸喺海海邊附近，即係你已經有個海事處嘅管。

222
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:56,810
我哋站喺嗰度啦，係嘛？因為一來就係啲污染問題啦，二來就係嗰啲嘅夜晚黑嗰啲嘅，即係嗰啲拖拖船嗰啲咧，即係發生啲噪音嗰陣時好嚴重嘅。喺呢個九十年代，即係有啲時間中夜晚都有啲噉嘅情況嘅。咁但係整體係減少咗嘅。咁但係我覺得。

223
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:16,870
即係整個海上管理問題，香港相對地係落後嘅。即係海事設施畀人一個感覺，即係藍馬報告睇到嗰個重點啦。即係可能太過恩巡又好，太過習慣又好，即係冇乜，即係冇乜動力去將香港個海事管理現代化嘅。咁噉，如果唔係政府就唔會揾個政務官。

224
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:36,880
入去嚇，去去處理某啲問題啦。咁但係，我覺得真係，我真係希望海事署班同事真係，即係我自己都行過幾年選嘅。老實講，我我十九歲行選，啊，臨尾臨尾上岸從良，可能係啊。咁但係個問題就係，即係即係你你應該要就翻整個香港嘅海事管理現代化係。

225
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:56,890
嘛噉，你有啲條例，家下國際做，你又做啦。咁但係關於好多問題係好恩循、好古舊、好即係落後啊。我成日用翻呢個嘅海上清理垃圾，你揾啲噉嘅船隻，即係當然係好懷舊、好有特色啦。係咪啊？但係呢個如果作為一個主要嘅，即係你我。

226
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:16,900
嚟點綴下，我唔介意嘅。你揾兩隻喺喺維多利亞港行嚟行去，作為旅客觀光，我絕對歡迎嘅，係咪？你可以合約講明，去留翻四隻喺海面行嚟行去，畀人睇下香港呢啲古舊清理形式噉。咁但係你整你嗰個主要嘅清理海上嘅團隊，真係要做得好㗎嘛？同

227
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,660
同埋我我真係睇唔到大嶼南附近，你你有呢啲船隊做清潔嘅，我真係唔係好見。

228
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:42,950
嗱，我住大嶼南嘅啊！我成日喺附近出入，我游水又好，行山又好，我從未見過大嶼南有清理海上嘅船隻出現過。真係我個個週末啊，隨去行山啊，去海邊啊，有時同啲環保團體去睇問題，我真係從未見過。咁希望你真係即係睇睇睇下點做係嘛？

229
00:52:42,950 --> 00:53:02,960
我好多年前都同呢個嘅誒康文處投訴，即係啲沙灘垃圾，即係點解唔清理好去？因為有時一吹東南風咧，係污糟到你唔唔想落水嘅。有時我同啲同事，即係或者啲嘉賓去去長沙海灘食晏係嘛？有時見到個海灘根本哇，真係一吹東南風咧～

230
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:22,970
就啲垃圾喺個岸邊附近，根本你一見到咁覺得呢個係咪係咪香港應出現嘅情況咧？又好怪嘅喎！即係康文署啲遊救，當然救生員唔係去負責清啦，佢係要佢又要即係通知清嘅垃圾啲人嚟。咁好可能佢朝頭早污染，佢清理嗰陣時已經捱到三點啦，成個朝頭早。

231
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:42,980
就污污糟、污糟、邋遢嘅，或者係第二日至嚟噉啊，成日污糟邋遢嘅。咁即係呢啲噉嘅情況，其實真係喺現代都會唔係即係你你啲沙灘幾多人啲人幾耐至去一次啊？係咪啊？一有問題即刻出呢啲係屬於管理嘅問題啊嘛。你啲你好多嘢官僚僵化到有啲，當然我咁唔係未必係海事處。

232
00:53:42,980 --> 00:54:02,990
全部嘅職責啦，但係你見到香港好多呢啲咁好優美嘅環境，呢啲噉嘅污染嘅問題、垃圾嘅問題，避風塘又有呢個嘅海中，呢個呢個誒，即係中環兩岸又有呢一個嘅啊海岸呢度好多環保團體，誒呢個南丫島啊、大嶼山啊，係嘛？我自己大我自己。

233
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:23,000
幾個作為大越南居民，經常見到呢啲情況，講咗十幾廿年，好似毫無改善咁咧。今日真係好多謝幾個團體嚟講出我嘅心聲啦。佢哋係更加積極、更加有系統、更加係全面係嘛，同埋有實際嘅例子係嘛。即係啊，Miss Misses Joe Wilson曾經試過連續四十日。

234
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:43,010
去一個沙灘捉垃圾，日日都有新垃圾出現嘅喺喺呢個南丫島。你話幾荒謬啊？仲你係咪啊？咁呢呢啲情況即係係係令人感到部門唔去做呢啲噉嘅即係改善嘅措施嘅話咧，家下好彩就係仍然有班居民好積極不斷去做，冇放棄到係嘛？至此。

235
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:59,000
刺激到我問呢個問題啊！咁首先好多就啲環保團體同埋啲地區團體，即係多年嚟嘅努力啦。唔係佢哋嘅帶領，有啲問題我都未必察覺嘅，係嘛？佢哋都提供咗好多資料畀我喺會上問噉。噉啊，真係好希望睇下喺呢呢一次嘅法例通過嘅同時。

236
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:16,630
我諗我同阿主席都會就翻呢個問題發言啦，喺條例二三讀嘅時候係嘛？咁但係都希望即係局方面咧能夠協調些少咧，將呢個問題有系統噉樣改善。我絕對我絕對即係理解，絕對唔係海事處或者係經濟局單方面。

237
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:36,920
即係嘅一個嘅行為，可以即係可以做到噉。但係整體嚟講，嗰幾個有關部門即係有啲咩可以改善咧？希望有個好嘅結果咯。多謝主席啊！其實咧，大家都知道今次呢個誒法例咧，就本來就好簡單嘅，亦都係誒同呢個即係執。

238
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:56,930
行清潔嘅行動咧，就唔係有直接關係。咁但係當然啦，即係你分唔到海上垃圾定係陸上嘅垃圾咧，就大家都好關心，即係香港嗰個海灘啊，即係同埋海面垃圾污染海洋啊嗰個問題。噉我哋今日有幾位團體代表嚟咧，即係我希望今日嘅。

239
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:16,940
會亦都唔係淨係話畀一個機會畀大家講完嘢，即係講完就算數。我咧就會希望即係大家開完呢個零鐘頭嘅會，都有一啲跟進。例如咧係幾個團體，佢哋都有好實際嘅經驗。咁究竟以後係同邊個部門，大家係可以協作咧？畀

240
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:28,480
比如誒呢個WWF話，即係佢哋都周圍做緊調查，睇見有人抌垃圾喎，咁咁例如香港仔係一個黑點，咁及後佢哋再睇到嘅時候。

241
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:48,880
即係有冇個對口係邊位邊個部門？佢哋可以即係快速通知，喂嗰度又又就嚟變黑點啦，就幫到大家去執法啊！即係透過呢啲緊密啲嘅聯絡去舉報，大家可以改善到嘅情況咧。即係我哋都知道，如果你就係執海面海面上邊船隻抌垃圾咧。

242
00:56:48,910 --> 00:57:08,920
係困難嘅，個海咁大，即係上面又裝唔到天眼噉。但係始終係有一啲即係實際行動上邊咧，大家係可以透過緊密啲嘅聯係同埋合作係可以改善到嘅情況。噉我相信即係嗰個緊密聯係咧，可能就係今日呢個會即係最能夠達得到嘅目標。

243
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:14,230
咯，噉就誒誒，有邊位官員係可以回應我呢點咧？

244
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,820
阿李生。

245
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,550
誒，多謝主席。

246
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,120
誒環保處咧喺誒針對呢一個。

247
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,710
海洋垃圾嗰方面咧係好重視嘅，所以咧我哋喺二零一二年。

248
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,580
十一月咧，我哋就成立咗一個咧，係跨部門嘅工作小組。

249
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:47,890
咁呢個工作小組咧，正正咧就係就住誒有關嘅部門，佢哋點樣合作去誒做好啲呢一方面嘅工作。咁除咗海事處，佢哋係負責執行。

250
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,950
誒，即係。

251
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,570
有關嘅法例去誒阻止誒。

252
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:13,050
個別嘅誒船隻啊，或者人士抌垃圾落海，同埋去清理海上邊嗰啲嘅漂浮垃圾之外咧，仲有三個有關嘅部門，包括咧呢個食環處，佢主要咧就係負責清理咧係誒。

253
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,240
一啲嘅誒岸邊嘅垃圾，除咗係街道垃圾之外。

254
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,770
咁另外咧，呢個康文署咧就負責呢一個嘅獻報、公報、泳灘。

255
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:31,650
範圍裏邊嘅垃圾，包括咧海面多啲嘅垃圾，係喺獻報。

256
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:44,610
誒公佈嗰個泳灘範圍裏邊嗰啲嘅漂浮垃圾，咁另外一個部門咧就係呢個嘅漁農自然護理署，佢主要咧就係負責呢一個海岸公園誒。

257
00:58:44,980 --> 00:59:04,990
嗰個範圍嗰啲嘅誒海上垃圾嘅咁四四個部門咧誒，透過我哋環保處誒呢個工作小組咧，我哋希望咧係加強佢哋嗰個嘅合作。咁亦都配合翻我哋個工作小組咧，我哋係做一個嘅十五個月嘅研究噉。

258
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:25,000
個研究報告咧喺上個月咧就已經係公佈咗，咁誒大家委員咧亦都有一份誒報告嘅副本喺手，咁嚟緊下一個月環境事務委員會咧亦都會就住我哋呢一個嘅研究報告咧有重點嘅討論，咁今日咧我。

259
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,230
就想簡介一下咧，我哋呢一個報告一啲嘅建議。

260
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:50,520
咁為咗要係即係做好依方面嘅工作咧，我哋一定要係睇一睇嗰啲垃圾佢嘅源頭喺邊度嚟嘅。咁所以咧，我哋係根據誒一啲嘅誒國際嘅組織，舉例一個國際海灘清潔運動嘅誒組織咧，佢哋有一

261
00:59:50,520 --> 01:00:10,530
個嘅資料記錄卡嘅噉，我哋用呢個記錄卡咧嚟做一個嘅垃圾分類嘅工作。透過垃圾分類咧，我哋就掌握到咧啲垃圾有機會係喺陸上嗰度製造出嚟咧，定係喺海嗰度嚟啦。但係無論佢係陸上或者海咧，其實。

262
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,810
始終嚟講咧，依啲垃圾咧都係由人為。

263
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:34,500
係製造出嚟嘅，咁所以咧，無論我哋話有八成係由陸上嚟，或者七成呢一個比例咧，誒，只可以作嚟一個參考。但係最重要一個信息咧，就係話所有呢啲垃圾咧都係人為製造出嚟嘅。咁所以咧，我哋希望咧就係透過。

264
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:54,510
誒呢個分類咧，我哋掌握到邊一啲嘅活動通常會製造多啲垃圾，亦都透過誒我哋呢個嘅調查咧，我哋睇一睇當啲垃圾跌咗落海之後，佢喺邊啲情況會積聚喺一啲嘅地方。噉我哋透過呢個研究咧，我哋掌握到咧誒。

265
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:55,070
誒。

266
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:15,360
風風呢一樣嘢咧係好重要嘅，尤其是有啲地方咧，佢係誒好當風嘅。噉佢會積聚垃圾嗰個嘅誒情況咧會嚴重啲嘅。除咗風之外咧，誒水流亦都係一個影響嘅因素。咁所以咧，我哋透過依個研究咧，我哋係揾到廿七個。

267
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:35,370
個誒比較上容易積聚垃圾嘅地方，噉我哋誒工作小組咧係而家咧係誒同有關嘅部門咧一齊睇睇，就住呢廿七個地方誒部門喺清理垃圾嗰方面點樣可以咧係就住佢嗰個嘅環。

268
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:55,380
環境因素嚟去調節佢哋嗰個清理垃圾嗰個嘅誒模式，因為咧誒有啲地方咧唔係淨係清理一次就得嘅，有啲可能咧一個月要清理幾次，有啲啦可能係兩個月清理一次。咁呢啲噉樣嘅調配咧係好重要嘅。當啲垃圾。

269
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:15,390
未積聚到一個嚴重嘅情況嘅時候咧，如果有人去清理咧，噉就最好。咁但係咧，仲有一個因素咧，就係其實你個報告咧，我哋誒我相信我哋委員咧係有睇過啦。呢度都話畀大家聽咧，嗰個文件號碼就係C B四一零四三一四到一五括弧零一噉就誒斷。

270
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:35,400
睇都係上翻我哋立法會個網頁嗰度咧，可以揾到呢個報告嘅。噉就誒下個月嘅誒環境事務委員會咧，亦都會就呢個報告去誒有個討論噉啊。希望大家到時留意啦。噉我見到有委員提問咧，亦知名議員，然後到就陳偉業議員嗱，因為兩個人排咗隊，噉我就畀個時。

271
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:55,410
時間啦，兩個人排隊，一人五分鐘先，係嘛？啊誒，多謝啊，多謝啊啊啊李生啊！咁其實我睇咗你個報告㗎啦，所以你唔使再解釋。嗱咁咧就你最尾講嘅部分咧就最重要㗎啦。嗱，我希望下一次開嗰個環境事務委員會嗰陣咧，你唔好再重複講你個報告嘅嘢。而反為講咧就係你嗰有啲噉嘅。

272
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:15,420
發現你其他部門如何配合？頭先講阿大舅成日講緊咧大魚腩噉啊，原來咧睇到個報告咧，就因為咧雨季咧啲風啊噉樣洋流又咁許，所以嗰度會積聚垃圾嘅噉啊。阿陳文議員就話從來未見過你哋啊，海事處啲船喺嗰度執垃圾噉，所以佢可能佢因此嘅累積咗好多嘅垃圾喺嗰度啦。咁嗱，必然。

273
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:35,430
你已經揾到個問題啦，噉你問題就下次上嚟開環境事委員會咧。我希望你就話畀我哋聽咧，哦，已經同海事處夾咗啦啊！咁咧喺呢啲地方喺噉嘅季節咧，你就會用噉嘅頻率去清潔垃圾啊，係係直頭針對你個finding咧，係畀一個solution出嚟，就唔好再重複講你個finding咧，因為冇意思啊，睇咗。

274
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:55,440
我哋已經係嘛？咁頭先我哋上次開會講咧就話，我哋又好難咧，成個海咁大，噉啊黑點喺邊度咧？咁咁頭先咧，阿阿鄭生你又講咗咯喎，阿龍生啊嘛，鄭生，鄭生啊，噉你話誒原來咧誒香港仔避風塘黑點嚟嘅噉，嗱咁近來咧我個的士啊嗰啲小巴業。

275
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:15,450
界嗰啲人咧就話：，哇！而家裝嗰啲阿阿阿秘書，你知啦，阿秘書長嗰啲嗰啲誒誒影相機啊，通街都係而家，即係捉快車嗰啲啊。啊，咁所以咧，啲人咧好小心啊，而家揸車。啊，咁所以咧，如果我哋能夠知道邊度有黑點咧，你係咪真可以裝一啲監察系統喺度咧？啊，其實冇嘢㗎，你你提醒佢嗱，你。

276
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:29,850
你冇亂嚟啊！我周到你㗎，噉就咁解啫嘛，係嘛？咁所以呢啲嘢咧唔難做嘅喎，係嘛？即係最緊要就揾唔揾到個黑點啫嘛，揾到嘅咪做少少嘢咯。咁咁呢個係有一定有幫助嘅，好嘛？即係請你哋考慮呢啲嘢嘅。

277
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:50,170
陳偉業議員，我只係我唔想同即係環保署喺度即係展開個罵戰啊！即係嗰個報告嗰啲好多嘅問題咧，就睇完之後你叫頭嘆息嘅，即係覺得呢個報告嘅粗疏啊，同埋嗰個垃圾來源嘅評估咧，即係嗰我絕對唔認同嗰個結論嘅啊！站喺大嶼山嚟講。

278
01:04:50,170 --> 01:05:10,180
我得九成嘅垃圾都係海上嘅，我睇唔到嗰度啲陸上即係咁多垃圾漂嚟。因為你熟悉嗰啲個航道，熟悉，因為我直情見到啲垃圾種類係點嘅。OK，直情見到銀絲米粉啊，見到公仔麪，即係見到啲拖鞋，即係好多係爛嘅拖鞋、爛嘅鞋係嘛。有時啲工作手套係嘛針筒係嘛。

279
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:30,190
即係針筒，我睇唔到會喺陸上漂離呢個長沙海灘嘅漂漂離呢個貝澳海灘嘅係咪咁？所以即係所以你你你嗰個評估嘅粗疏，我唔想喺度再再再糾纏你嘅問題，因為去到環境委員會同你再拗過，我都係委員噉，但係真係好希望我即係嗰個嘅。

280
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:36,140
我係睇個結果啫，個成因我唔同你再拗啦。呢個問題係嘛，即係拗完都冇意思嘅。

281
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:56,430
我要個結果就係啲個頭先我都講過個別部門，究竟個海面垃圾你有幾多資源人力去清邊啲係重點？個計劃係點？我講過沙灘嗰度，你話有康文處，我同你講過早兩個個零月前去沙灘睇，啲仍然見到垃圾喺度，冇人喺度清嘅。當然我都知道佢部門，我都熟悉佢部門嗰啲。

282
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:16,440
嘅行政安排有問題係點？呢個嘅呢個嘅救生員唔會清理垃圾嘅。OK，佢係要叫承建商嚟做嘅，一層壓一層嘅。噉你點樣去改善呢個機制？朝頭早九點鐘翻嚟已經發覺成個沙灘都污糟嘅。佢幾耐可以清到？即係你畀一個服務承諾我哋啊，每一個過程係點？

283
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:36,450
點樣見到某啲沙灘好污糟嘅？我三個月前去行呢個嘅大嶼山，經過大浪灣又係鋪滿曬垃圾嘅成個大浪灣，係嘛好靚嘅沙灘。卅年前直情有海龜喺度生蛋，家下冇咗㗎啦，已經家下已經絕種啦。大浪灣啲海啲海龜係嘛生蛋嗰啲情況係嘛？呢個另一個問題。

284
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:56,490
咁所以即係好多呢啲環境問題，導致到香港嘅自然消失啦。係係嘛？你有啲咩方法去即係呢個另一個問題啦？誒，唔喺度糾纏啦。咁好希望真係我哋希望有成果。你個工作小組成立呢個係一個好嘅開始嗱，做跨部門去做呢個係一個好嘅開始。但你點樣去有效去？

285
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:16,500
建立一套行政措施，確保個個部門係做到應有嘅職責，而令到我哋講嗰個問題唔使啲環保團體三個月去清一次。我自己親身經歷芝麻灣清完一次，三個月去又係咁多垃圾，係咪啊？阿Miss Misses Joe Wilson南丫島，佢哋清完又清，係咪啊？垃圾灣嗰度。

286
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:30,090
好多團體去清源又清，即係香港啲環保團體盡嘅力係好令人敬佩嘅，係咪咁？但係你部門嗰啲應該做好你自己嘅嘢，你你你收人工做㗎嘛？呢班人係義務㗎嘛？

287
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,680
我唔希望真係十年後坐喺度，又係講翻噉嘅嘢。

288
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:40,600
即係你哋自己有少少慚愧之心，同埋有少少進步之心，先得㗎做官。

289
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,840
唔再講啦，主席。

290
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:50,170
講到我都悶啊！呢個問題。啊，其實咧，我跟進翻我自己提出嚟嗰個嗰個問題咧，就。

291
01:07:50,450 --> 01:08:10,460
實在咧，同誒環保團體大家協作咧，就應該係執行嘅部門嘅環境署咧，就唔係執行嘅部門。咁但係李生就好用把握時間，想介紹佢嘅報告。不過你個報告喺環境事務委員會嗰度會㗎啦。反為咧就海事處同事誒或者阿陳小姐翻去，亦都聯絡食環處。

292
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:30,470
嘅同時，睇下即係有邊啲熱線電話係邊位官員咧，係可以直接畀誒NGO、畀民間團體，大家直接揾到嘅嚇。鄭生其實而家我哋同呢啲團體已經有溝通渠道啦。譬如我頭先講Miss Joe Wilson佢嘅佢清潔發現咗嘢，都直接有電郵畀我哋。

293
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:50,480
其實我哋而家現有係有渠道嘅，其實我哋好倚賴呢啲團體，佢畀呢啲資料我哋，因為我哋其實冇可能會經常派人去每一個攤，因為佢哋會去好多地方。其實而家我哋現有已經有一個溝溝通渠道㗎啦。咁但係誒居民舉報員即係部門都。

294
01:08:50,480 --> 01:09:10,490
要有足夠人手，即係快速有效地處理先得啦。但係即係我想象之中就係不能夠快速有效處理，即係否則就唔使居民成日去做義工。誒嗱，居民舉報其實舉報垃圾，我哋經其實我哋嘅呢幾年嘅舉報數字一年年都增多。咁其實我哋鼓鼓鼓勵，其實我幾時都話誒靠。

295
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:30,500
可以設嗰幾個人巡邏，冇可能睇曬所有嘅。我哋好依賴市民嘅幫幫助，咁呢幾市民都係好踴躍去舉報啲垃圾嘅。咁其實市民舉報嘅垃圾咧，我哋可以好好短時間之內就回應㗎啦。反為誒環保團體所畀我哋資料咧，就唔係話誒嗰堆垃圾你執咗佢。

296
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:50,510
唔係嘅，其實環保署係畀到一啲好寶貴嘅資料畀我哋分析嘅。其實好似誒，我之前話真係有啲誒垃圾袋入邊裝咗一啲睇落係同船隻修理有關係，咁令到我哋可以改變我哋一啲一啲巡查啊一一一一一啲策略。咁呢個係係係兩件事嚟嘅，係唔同係唔同。

297
01:09:50,510 --> 01:10:10,520
如果一般市民舉報垃圾，我哋一般嚟講，我哋可以好短時間之內。如果一講緊誒係誒港口啊、避風塘，我哋基本上我哋可以一兩個鐘頭之內去就已經可以已經處理咗㗎啦。嚇！但係誒環保團體畀我哋嘅資料，亦都係另外一樣嘢嚟嘅。O K，好啦，嗱，如果大家委員咧，係。

298
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:30,530
有個書面咧，佢哋冇代表嚟啦。咁都多，借呢機會多謝佢哋有個書面報告。咁希望呢份嘅，即係佢哋嘅意見書都可以畀翻有關部門啊。係會嘅，我哋收到所有意見書都會畀官員嘅嗱。咁咧就同大家講一講我哋即係呢個誒審議小組委員會跟住落嚟嘅工作。其實跟住落嚟就冇工作㗎啦。

299
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:50,540
因為嗰個審議期咧，喺四月二十七號咧就已經係誒誒嗰個逐條審議已經完成，同埋五月十三號咧，我哋係未能夠喺大會嗰度提出延展誒呢個動議，咁所以條法例咧就已經係自動生效咗㗎啦。噉就秘書處就會幫手。

300
01:10:50,540 --> 01:11:10,550
將我哋呢個小組委員會嘅工作報告咧，就遞交畀誒內會等其他委員知悉。我哋冇機會喺立法會大會講嘢㗎啦，就呢個條例冇㗎啦，生效咗啊，過咗啊。你講咗好多嘢啦喺大會，不過唔係講啲咁啫，死唔斷氣啊嘛。你你咪喺納入嘅時候再講咯。有冇？

301
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:20,610
冇機會啊！你逐條納入嘅時候，實有呢個環境局局長畀你減人工嗰條㗎。哦哦哦，即係你講用財政撥款嗰個。咪係咯～

302
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:25,180
咁呢個都底牌都可以係你減佢人工嘅原因之一啦。

303
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:35,260
噉就誒，我多謝團體代表出席，噉啊，多謝委員同埋多謝官員出席。噉我哋呢個小組審議委員會嘅工作就完結啦，散會，唔該。
