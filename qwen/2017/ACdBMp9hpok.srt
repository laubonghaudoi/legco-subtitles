1
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,340
他們的發言。

2
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,520
包括團體嘅意見同埋意見書咧，係唔會受到。

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,530
請各位喺發言時不要中英文夾雜，以便對即時傳譯方面引起不便。

4
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:21,900
啊！如果冇提交書面意見書嘅團體同埋代表，希望你哋喺會後提交翻意見書，以便委員會可以同政府及工作小組繼續跟進。

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:42,280
請留意在桌前的須知中各項保安措施。旁聽席嘅公眾人士亦可向在場立法會保安人員索取有關須知。

6
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:07,830
立法會權力及特權條例嘅保護同埋豁免嚇，大家嘅意見，記住咧陣間落嚟嘅發言同埋意見咧，係唔會受到立法會權力及特權條例嘅保護同埋豁免㗎。

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,230
歡迎我哋第二節嘅團體誒出席本委員會嘅誒聽證會喺呢度咧，係誒要同各位團體咧就係誒指出，大家咧如果有需要可以使用耳筒，同埋喺電腦版上邊選擇語言嘅頻道。

8
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:42,220
由於時間所限咧，個個團體同埋個別人士，我哋咧只可以係畀大家發言唔超過三分鐘。當鐘聲搶響起之後咧，大家就要停止發言㗎啦。咁而家咧，大家嗰個編座位咧就係三。

9
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,660
唔該，可唔可以check check個個係咪有有本report？

10
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,950
You should all have copies of the index. Have all of you got a copy? Just before we start.

11
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,460
Like Goldman Sachs, like HSBC, Swire, Marriott, these are all our members.

12
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,400
Thank you. I will have to make this very quick. I'm going to do in English because my Chinese isn't very good. Sorry.

13
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,370
employee demographic，even if they may not currently have any employees who are transitioning or even identify as transgender.

14
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:30,630
誒，我諗三分鐘夠啦。跟住咧就係陳世榮女士寫商言會，係。

15
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:33,210
10 years ago, our creating inclusive workplaces for LGBT employees campaign started. At that time, understanding adoption of diversity inclusion was at a very early stage, and few companies had this on their agenda. But fast forward 10 years, and the story is now very different.

16
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:20,930
法存在嘅，而有愛正正就係我哋要對社會嘅弱勢，社會上面係因為唔同狀況受到痛苦嘅人係有同理心。咁所以我係絕對贊同政府係開展翻呢個諮詢，盡快係設立翻一個唔係依照手術作為前提嘅性別承認法。

17
00:01:42,220 --> 00:02:02,230
三十二到六十二嘅代表同埋個人逐一發言，咁之後我就會請工作小組同誒係回應個別團體嘅人士嘅意見啦，同埋咧就請委員發問嘅。咁首先咧就係誒第一位嘅發言。

18
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:22,240
人士咧就係啊羅冠聰先生，佢係香港眾志嘅主席。請，係誒首先多謝主席，因為我嘅誒保釋條件而再請畀我誒率先發言啦。噉我哋今日咧就係講誒根據法庭嘅指示，我哋點樣開展性別認同承認法嘅諮詢同埋立法嘅工作。噉我頭先聽咗好多。

19
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:42,250
嘅團體發言啦，咁但係我覺得我哋今日嚟講唔係，即係我哋今日討論嘅核心唔係講宗教價值，亦都唔係講家庭嘅價值，而係講緊我哋成個社會係應該要點樣康代社會上面嘅弱勢。我哋作為公民，我哋要點樣係照顧其他因為唔同條件而受緊苦嘅公民。

20
00:02:42,290 --> 00:03:02,300
呢個正正係一個民主社會令到人哋誒信任同埋安心嘅原因。跨性別人士嘅痛苦咧，唔係石頭爆出嚟嘅，咁當中一定係有好多嘅社會因素同埋好多原因。而呢一個遺留已久嘅問題咧，其實應該成個社會一齊係去解決。其中一個方法當然係由政府去立法。咁大家頭先一路。

21
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:22,310
我都講咧，喺零四年嘅時候咧，英國已經係立咗呢一個性性別承認法。咁而喺佢推出一條宣傳片當中咧，有個叫做Jake嘅跨性別人士。佢當中講咗一句令到我覺得好深刻嘅，就係佢話喺佢身份證上面見到一個好細嘅F轉落去一個M字嘅時候咧，佢覺得佢人生。

22
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:42,320
終於第一次係有啲嘢係會復正常，走回正軌。大家我想言之喺佢人生當中，過去咁多年嚟，佢要掩飾自己，要戴上一個面具去裝扮，從而顯身出嚟嘅痛苦，係令到佢困擾咗幾耐。我相信大家都好明白，就係講唔即係即。

23
00:03:42,320 --> 00:04:02,330
只係講自己唔相信價值，唔唔係自己信念嘅説話，你都已經覺得好痛苦㗎啦。譬如話，我即係邀請好多在座團體，假如你話唔支持同性婚姻嘅，我叫你大聲咁講話，我支持同性婚姻，大家都一定好痛苦㗎啦。咁大家又可唔可以想像到一個人，原來佢即係佢心？

24
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:22,340
你性別同佢生理性別係唔一樣嘅時候，掩飾咗咁耐，佢嘅痛苦係有幾咁大咧？咁所以今時今日，我哋見到香港亦都的確存在住呢一個問題。跨性別嘅人士，佢哋無論係有自殺嘅念頭啊，定還是抑鬱嘅比例，都遠比起正常人為高。咁呢個正正就。

25
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:42,350
就係我哋今日要開展要處理嘅問題喺頭先嘅會議當中咧，有好多人講過話家庭價值呢樣嘢。咁首先，我覺得其實家庭價值絕對係唔會因為你話一小部分社會嘅弱勢，佢哋能夠係可有機會係作出一個轉換性別嘅一個痕徑而。

26
00:04:42,350 --> 00:05:02,360
而去遭到破壞、遭到摧毀，其實香港人嘅家庭價值係冇咁脆弱啦。同埋香港人嘅家庭價值唔係由一男一女維係，呢個可能係食呢個可能係家庭嘅一個好重要嘅元素。但係更加重要嘅就係有愛。即係如果你係一男一女，但係冇愛嘅話咧，個家庭都係冇辦。

27
00:05:49,950 --> 00:06:09,960
Okay, I think you need to make use of the time. Oh, 鄭浩基， now， yeah. Okay, I think the the time is being counted. Okay, dear honourable members, Community Business is a non-profit organisation registered charity based in Hong Kong. Founded in 2003, our organisation works with companies to advance responsible, inclusive business practices spanning all industries. They include companies

28
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,100
及做另一性別性器官設置嘅手術。

29
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,650
以及會損害大眾對於唔真實嘅事情唔認同嘅自由同埋人權。

30
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,720
點樣嘅方法、治療嘅標準，但係就唔應該係同法律上面跨性別人士嘅性別係咪得到承認咧？係受到掛鈎嘅。

31
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:50,250
就算真係有個別人士因為要求設立自我聲明模式，又或任何模式嘅性別承認制度不果。

32
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:32,420
Local talent. Times are changing. We know this from our own research, working with leading local, regional, global organisations, and of course from our work with the leading companies here in Hong Kong.

33
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:05,300
因為首先，根據DSM Five，性別煩、性別焦躁症本身係屬於精神科嘅病症，同埋係需要接受治療嘅項目。

34
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:10,450
又或渴望可長期得到跨性別荷爾蒙嘅注射，使自己嘅外觀是另一性別，使自己感覺良好，係個人嘅事，個人嘅自由。

35
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:52,910
另外，關於有人以今年七月八號有一名跨性別人士自殺嘅事，指社會應該設立性別承認制度呢個講法，其實係煽情同埋唔妥嘅。

36
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:20,490
第二跨性別荷爾蒙嘅療法本身有某程度不良副作用，而對於某一啲人嚟講，呢啲不良副作用除咗會喺生理方面，亦都會出現喺情緒抑鬱方面。

37
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:12,350
而第二咧就係我哋覺得唔應該係設立即係有手術嘅要求，因為咧個人對身體自主權咧係一個基本嘅人權，係應該受到徹底嘅保護。而跨性別人士亦都係應該有權選擇係唔係接受任何形式嘅治療。

38
00:10:50,530 --> 00:11:08,410
而走上輕生之路，呢個亦都唔能夠成為香港，甚至世界任何地方要設立自我聲明模式，又或任何模式嘅性別承認制度，唔顧呢個制度對整體社會會帶嚟嘅各方面不妥影響。多謝主席。

39
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:40,580
我哋唔應該將呢件自殺案混淆視聽噉樣，歸因於社會冇性別承認制度，而且冇證據顯示當事人係因為要求社會設立自我聲明模式，又或任何模式嘅性別承認制度不果而自輕生。

40
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:53,650
Our campaign has established groundbreaking biannual Hong Kong LGBT+ inclusion index and annual LGBT+ awards, and pioneering research across Asia, including our Hong Kong climate study, which we thank the working group for citing in the consultation paper. Like the EOC and CUHK survey published last year, our survey results.

41
00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:13,660
show that LGBT+ discrimination exists and lack of acceptance in the workplace harms productivity and the ability of companies operating in Hong Kong to retain and attract the best talent. The study provided companies with a compelling business case for LGBT+ inclusion. The current lack of protections for LGBT+ rights in Hong Kong proved

42
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:33,670
to be a major factor affecting the ability of companies to recruit and retain top talent in Hong Kong. The current legal environment fails to protect the LGBT+ community, falls short and is not conducive to the kind of business environment that these companies expect. We share with you our 2017 report, which shows our LGBT+

43
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:53,680
Plus inclusion is no longer focused on just my leading financial institutions, but is expanding across all industries such as automotive, hospitality and engineering. This year, we asked participating companies questions specifically relating to transgender inclusion, and we were delighted to see many proactively implementing such policies and benefits for this.

44
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:21,680
47 countries worldwide already have official gender recognition systems in place. If Hong Kong is to be truly Asia's world city and maintain its competitiveness, it must implement world-class standards on gender recognition. Anything short of this will erode Hong Kong's credibility as a global financial centre and as a tractor of leading foreign.

45
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:53,570
We urge you to have a look at this report. Yeah, we'll circulate that report. Thank you. 考委方誌成先生，主席，我反對設立性別承認制度。我認為個別人士唔接受自己嘅原生性別，渴望可以做原生性別性器官去除手術。

46
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:30,740
但係設立性設立跨性別承認制度，又話變性別承認制度，卻係社會嘅事，且會帶嚟對整體社會會有好多唔妥嘅深遠影響，包括對性別教育、家庭倫理、正確人生觀、正確價值觀嘅扭曲。

47
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,410
性。

48
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,000
dissenting judgment forms part of the whole.

49
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,860
第三就係唔應該係設立一個實際生活體驗年期嘅規定啦。

50
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,040
is eligible to marry a wife. Human rights are born with, no acquisition.

51
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,360
not a quiet right can eliminate the right of W to marry a wife in.

52
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:56,160
多謝誒，黃秀雲女士。The work group adopts the definition by the WHO and

53
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:25,420
亦都係唔應該同佢哋嘅權利去掛鈎啦，尤其係性別重置手術咧，其實係一個高度入侵性同埋係唔可以逆轉嘅外科程序嘅時候，亦都唔應該係絕對唔應該以呢樣嘢咧係成為性別承認嘅前提。

54
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:22,920
infringement is infringement. As a teacher, I protect pupils from conflicting laws and infringing human rights. In W's case, the appeal was only allowed by majority.

55
00:12:51,150 --> 00:13:07,640
男性嚟嘅，擁有所謂嘅，嘅而所擁有所謂嘅陽光氣質嘅女性，亦都唔會被法律咧認定為一個男性。咁所以咧，對於跨性別人士，我哋亦都係應該有相同嘅對待，唔應該係以佢哋嘅行為舉止係咪足夠。

56
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:14,330
court of final appeal that W suffers gender identity disorder. As a school teacher, I take preventive measures to nurture pupils to keep order, thereby to stay away from any disorder.

57
00:14:48,640 --> 00:15:06,390
88th paragraph of the summary, the work group states that gr is an issue within the context of conflict of laws, inconsistent with the fundamental public policy, and does not represent a serious infringement of human rights.

58
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:46,860
真係性別嘅行為咧，而去減少被歧視嘅機會。咁所以咧，我哋再有一係認為，我哋應該落實呢個性別成嘅措施嘅時候咧，只係需要確認當事人咧係一個永久地以另一個性別身份生活嘅意願咧，就應該係已有效，而唔需要另外再設立其他嘅規限。都係主席。

59
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:29,330
thank you。誒，下一位，鄧家亨先生，係主席，你好。噉我哋在廿一咧，就住香港嘅性別成制立法咧，主要有幾個意見嘅。咁第一個首先就係其實性別身份係有一個社會成見，唔係單純醫學性嘅一個問題，係唔應該由醫學嘅診斷咧去主導嘅點樣言行。

60
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:49,340
女字先係一個男性或者女性啦，而係由一個性別誒社會嘅規範啦、習慣去決定嘅。因為咧，跟所以咧，一個人嘅性別身份咧係唔應該即係由客觀生理醫學嘅問題去判斷，而係由社會嘅問題。醫學嘅診斷咧，只係咧適用於咧判判別咧，即係跨性別人士係咪應該需要治療啦，或者係。

61
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:51,150
因為一個開放嘅社會咧，係唔應該用法嚟去規限一個人點樣去實踐佢哋嘅性別身份。喺法律上面，我亦都唔應該係因為一個人佢嘅性別上嘅行為咧，去拒絕佢哋承認佢哋嘅性別啦。咁舉個例子就係一個喜歡男性嘅男同志咧，法律上面佢仍然係被認為係一個男。

62
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:27,970
酷酷啊，係係咪足夠貼近佢哋確認嘅性別咧？去作為法律入邊去判斷，接唔接納佢哋成為性別身份嘅標準。尤其係而家呢個社會上面，對於跨性別人士係有一個偏見嘅情況喺底下咧。而我哋更加係唔應該噉樣做，因為佢哋好可能咧係會違心嚟作出一啲符合佢哋身。

63
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:34,620
by not affirming to any disorder, pupils will not go astray. Light up you torturing oneself with no cure. To uphold women's convention, only born females are entitled to women's rights. Born males are entitled to men's rights. That be

64
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,670
Thanks.

65
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,220
帶領我進入新 life。

66
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,250
Like what done to me?

67
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,430
依家我連去廁所都成問題。

68
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,930
唔該，下一位Mr. Henry Che。

69
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,500
我叫Henry，我諗冇人覺得我唔係一個男人。

70
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,630
但喺法律上，我係一個女人。我張身份證上面都住寫住女人。

71
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,060
and exercise their born rights to marry the opposite sex.

72
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,440
呢個諮詢有得公眾決定跨性別人權係大錯特錯嘅。

73
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:19,920
Anal partners who are engaged in premarital sex can go through annulments.

74
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:49,200
In short, not any rights acquired can override, replace or cancel rights which are born.

75
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:38,980
as a parent and a wife, I object to any policy interrupting annulment, or blocking the way to a new living style.

76
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:57,970
王偉明、關啟文同明光社，同埋嗰啲腦殘嘅教徒，即係嗰啲自稱家長、自稱公民、自稱關愛嘅狂犬分身，佢哋係最惡毒嘅糖衣毒藥。

77
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:18,000
我本應該W案之後就會等到性別承認立法，點知政府堅持要活摘我器官先畀翻男性身份哦，因為政府怠慢令到我冇辦法正常生活。

78
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:45,190
跨性別人權同言論自由一樣，係與生俱來嘅，唔係話啲邪教吹雞叫曬啲流民喪屍教徒出嚟，人多蝦人少，去諮詢會公聽會度，周圍圍住人哋狗吠，政府就會扣頭，此叫跨性別人權㗎嘛？

79
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:48,290
judgment paragraph one eight five finds that it is artificial to assert the pros operative transsexuals have not been deprived of the right to marry, as according to law, they remain able to marry a person of their former opposite.

80
00:15:49,830 --> 00:16:09,840
traditional marriage has not yet been abandoned. In response to Bishop Hare of the Catholic Church, I'm here to testify. Christian marriage. I've gone through annulment by premarital sex. I was too sinful to receive the sacrament of marriage. Annulment.

81
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Certain of those who've spoken in the last session and some of those.

82
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,790
活摘器官極可恥，促立性別承認法。

83
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,540
你哋必落地獄，邊個聽佢哋講？一定不得好死！

84
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:22,510
If my if I may say so, their purported worry is wholly misplaced, and their arguments is completely wrong in principle.

85
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:46,770
佢哋係令到社會撕裂嘅毒瘤，政府唔單止唔可以聽佢哋嘅意見，直頭應該將呢啲害蟲徹底消滅。

86
00:19:50,620 --> 00:20:01,040
Speaking before me would accept only the most restrictive model of gender recognition, including notably compulsory surgical and medical requirements.

87
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:37,630
呢啲大話精誤導公眾，鼓吹仇恨，危害他人性命，對公安造成威脅。佢哋係不折不扣嘅邪教法西斯。

88
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:14,460
或這些 people resist the idea of gender recognition altogether，because they say they worry that to do otherwise would undermine the traditional understanding of gender， family or marriage。

89
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:26,360
呢啲卑鄙小人周圍同人講跨性別人是換性之後會後悔，又將跨性別者等同變態性罪犯，但係數據話曬畀我哋知，佢哋講嘅嘢全部都係假嘅。

90
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:12,690
我已經親身證實過，黃偉明同埋護家協會黎浩華將跨性別等同精神病，關起門抹黑跨性別平權，影響言論自由。呢啲我全部都有證有據。

91
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:19,410
Right to respect for privacy under Article 17 of the ICCPR refers to the sphere of a person's life in which he or she can freely express her, his or her identity, and this includes protection of a person's gender identity.

92
00:18:47,200 --> 00:19:03,980
就係佢哋導致無數嘅司法覆核案，大量咁不斷浪費公帑，就係佢哋令到跨性別者無法生活，逼死我哋。黃偉明、明光石、關啓文，你哋一干人等係殺人兇手。

93
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:45,060
好噉啊！下一位，黃啟揚先生。I'm grateful, Chair. Ah, my name is Kaiyun Wong. Ah, I'm a doctoral candidate in law at the University of Hong Kong. Ah, with a research focus on comparative human rights law. I've done research and written on transgender rights.

94
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:39,020
once it is recognised that gender recognition is a matter of human right, it cannot legitimately be seen to be in any intrinsic tension with the concept of family. The exercise of human rights by sexual minority cannot in principle be made conditional upon its acceptance by sexual majority.

95
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:43,090
There perhaps can be little quarrel with the importance of family and perhaps marriage, but it is a nonsense to say that transgender persons should not therefore be recognised in the gender with which they identify themselves. The proper starting point must be that gender recognition is a fundamental human right.

96
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,920
噉。

97
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,870
誒。

98
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,430
咁而家你突然間又去？

99
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,310
下一位，錢志英女士。

100
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,250
因此，採用一個基於自我決定的性別模式是較為優先的。謝謝。

101
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:20,600
咁如果咧，我哋係按人嘅喜惡咧，隨時咁去亂咁去改性別咧？

102
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:11,770
噉我哋中國人又話誒身體髮膚受於父母，而西方咧亦都講誒神創造男同女，睇佢哋係美好嘅。

103
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:44,980
加咗嗰個性別承認制度嘅話咧，係會帶嚟咧一種混亂，因為我哋一自細一齣世已經接受噉嘅教育。

104
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:33,250
咁甚至乎連出世紙、身份證都改嘅話咧，誒會帶嚟混亂咯。因為誒我哋都話男女係有分別，有分生理同心理兩樣嘅分別。

105
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:38,430
幾咯嚇咁誒？至於話講到誒呢個疾病啦，易性傾向焦躁症呢一樣嘢，咁亦都講咗係一種疾病啦。噉我亦都有個女，佢有誒呢個誒。

106
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:36,200
Medical and surgical treatment can be forced upon a transgender person seeking to be recognised. I would add that there is now also an emerging consensus among international and supranational human rights bodies that depathologisation of transgenderism.

107
00:22:45,590 --> 00:23:02,630
係誒，主席各位誒，我咧就係反對性別承認制度嘅，因為咧每一個人嘅性別啊、膚色、高矮、容顏咧都係各有獨特唔同嘅。我哋自細咧接受嘅教育咧都係去欣賞同埋接納自己同人哋嘅差異嘅。

108
00:23:46,260 --> 00:24:03,550
誒，我就好唔贊同噉樣樣加呢個噉嘅承認性別制度。如果要加，唔係加呢一樣嘢咯，嚇，即係帶嚟混亂。噉我亦都喺法國住過，亦都有唔少嘅異性朋友。噉佢哋都同我講，係因為成長裏邊受到傷害。

109
00:20:43,090 --> 00:21:03,100
在六月這年，聯合國人權委員會，which monitors compliance with the international covenant on civil and political rights， and of course the ICCPR is part of Hong Kong law through the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights， the committee for the first time in its quasi-judicial capacity confirmed definitively that the

110
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:59,310
Accordingly, any failure or refusal to recognise a person's identified gender or unnecessarily restrictive criteria, in effect to deny the existence of a sexual minority who cannot so who cannot be so denied, are inevitably unlawful both under international and Hong Kong law.

111
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:19,320
在一篇我寫於2015《香港法律期刊》的文章中，我解釋任何官方承認的全手術要求是 undesirable，到點到成為不可接受的原則。我堅持這個觀點，並指出現在確實有幾乎普遍的國際和比較人權法學界的共識，即沒有。

112
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,120
好。

113
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,090
與其話分別男女嘅法例係歧視。

114
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,070
我性別聲明就變咗係個人嘅權利啦。

115
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,780
更進一步，可以凌駕於一切嘅社會秩序。

116
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,790
好重要嘅事情嚟㗎，乜嘢叫真實咧？

117
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,870
嘅人權其實有冇被尊重到咧？我嘅私隱權又有冇被保障到咧？

118
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:37,330
咁而政府又做咗幫兇嘅話，咁政府嘅誠信一旦破壞之後咧，個後果亦都好嚴重嘅。

119
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:01,910
婚姻制度咧，亦都係一男一女，係為咗保護呢個家庭核心嘅價值，能夠好好咁照顧同埋繁殖下一代嘅。

120
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:25,690
任何改變性別嘅條件咧，包括醫生診斷啊、荷爾蒙治療啊、手術呢啲要求咧，都話被認為係侵害個人嘅權利。

121
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:11,960
咁外國亦都亦都有人咧，因為婚後咧先至到知道個妻子係變性人而離婚。噉係邊一個出賣咗呢個丈夫咧？

122
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:52,360
啊！突然間好唔介意誒，總之我覺得有好多嘢都係誒病嚟嘅，噉我覺得立法係唔可以幫醫好佢哋嘅病咯，噉。

123
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:23,930
噉我覺得政府係一個幫兇嚟嘅，因為佢發出另外一張嘅改咗另外一張嘅身份證，同埋出世紙，連出世紙都可以改，一件有一個。

124
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:49,380
嚇！因為佢破壞咗大家對政府嘅信任，同埋人與人之間嘅信任，同埋嗰種安全感。咁誒，會令到好似我一個小市民都走出嚟講嘢。

125
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:24,910
咁誒，我自己亦都試過細個嗰陣時咧，我都想做男仔嘅嚇。咁但係而家就後嚟改變，因為我大咗啦嘛，我都係獨立嘅人。我而家尤其是而家係男女平等，冇乜嘢嘢我係唔可以做嘅嚇。噉我都係誒要去欣賞自己咯嚇，去接納自。

126
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,430
唔該。

127
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,690
婦女嘅人權。

128
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,250
好，下一位譚家駿先生，主席。

129
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,600
我驚，我唔知點算，我覺得被冒犯。

130
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:48,100
其實呢個情況係咪虛構咧？我唔係，原來係外國係發生緊嘅。

131
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,780
噉我係唔係就係變成係歧視或者仇恨呢一位女性咧？

132
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:23,150
硬要所有人喺日常生活度接受咁兒欺嘅性別轉變，其實係咪又係違反人權咧？

133
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:22,690
台小組裡面你要有兩年嘅一個後天性別嘅生活經驗喺裏面，再加上唔同嘅因素喺裏面嘅時候，先至可以去轉換你嘅性別。哇！

134
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:28,770
最後，我想請大家考慮一下一個場景：一有一日，我喺更女更衣室換衫嘅時候，睇到一位自稱係女性，但係仍然有男性生理性器官嘅男性喺我面前換衫。

135
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:13,850
加上如果有呢一個嘅法誒立法改性別嘅呢個途徑，好大機會咧，其實製造咗更多自我聲明改性別嘅結果喎，就係用人權嚟做理由，試意淺談。

136
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:18,300
有一個深水埗區議員啊，西門兄講，佢就話啦：，你哋不能夠用人權嘅歧視去踐踏我哋嘅傳統價值。我哋真係好想問佢，你能唔能夠用呢個傳統嘅價值去踐踏我哋嘅基本人權咧？

137
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:59,630
翻翻去現實嘅生活，從來唔會反其道而行，要改變社會嘅常態去遷就呢啲患者嘅。不過而家就好似想有呢種噉嘅情況，要擾亂社會嘅秩序，去遷就一啲有心理障礙嘅人士。

138
00:25:49,730 --> 00:26:09,740
好下一位誒，李碧然小姐係主席，各位，我係反對呢個立法嘅，因為咧，我睇到立法嘅理據咧，其實幾荒謬嘅。噉啊，支持立法嘅人咧就話用人權嚟做理由，認為自我否定出生時嗰個嘅生理性別係人權，咁即係話自。

139
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:45,980
國際特赦組織就曾經喺《明報》刊登個文章啊，呼籲香港政府立即廢除改變性別嘅所有手術要求，即係要寬鬆到咧覺得係另一性別就可以改。咁仲認為全部有關分別男女嘅法例都係歧視，都係要禁止。

140
00:26:45,980 --> 00:27:05,990
如果只係用人權嚟做理由，個人權利如果可以超然到凌駕於一切社會秩序，噉就好好容易就發生以下嘅情況啦。男性覺得自己係女性就可以入誒成為女性啦，佢就可以入女廁啊，入女更衣室噉樣。而我，我係一個天生嘅女性，我既我既

141
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:43,470
對於身邊所認識嘅情緒病患者啦，其實我哋一向都係盡量係用關懷去對待佢哋嘅，提醒佢哋定時食藥啊、復診啊，經常留意住佢哋嘅精神狀態噉樣，開導佢哋，盡量幫助佢哋走出佢哋混亂嘅情情況，希望佢哋接納翻自己反。

142
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,020
即係呢啲説話真係非常難聽㗎。

143
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,830
和 insufficient protections of their human rights.

144
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,130
喂！但係關心佢哋，講到權利，講到立法唔得。

145
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,050
Next is Mr Peter Reading, Reading, sorry.

146
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,700
即係頭先羅冠聰講得好好㗎，其實婚姻裏面講緊一種愛同埋一種尊重啊嘛。

147
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,430
即係其實成個成變成義化好簡單，講一兩個字，就係一個尊重喺裏面啊嘛。

148
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,970
即係基於人道立場，我哋要尊重佢哋，畀好多嘅關懷同關心佢哋。

149
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,850
如果即係你哋唔承認呢種愛，唔承認呢種尊重，淨係講一男一女嘅時候，

150
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,090
因為你錢搭緊我嘅範圍，噉你關咩心？即係呢啲係虛偽偽君子。

151
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,750
政府唔好再拖啦！W案之後已經拖四年半啦，希望你真係認認真真去做呢一件事，多謝主席。

152
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:31,120
The evidence available to the EOC is that transgender people face significant levels of discrimination, lack of understanding.

153
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:34,420
即係有啲有啲説話係好難聽㗎，即係有啲議員好中意講㗎。哇！問你支唔支持同性戀？支唔支持跨性別？我好關愛呢啲同志朋友㗎。

154
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:20,680
Hello, my name is Peter Redding and I'm legal counsel at the Equal Opportunities Commission, which many of you will know is Hong Kong's statutory equality body with duties to promote equality across all of society.

155
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:23,490
但係你不得不話，即係不得就話哦，性別性別法唔得嘅，因為就係跨越緊一男一女、一夫一妻。即係婚姻係咪就係一夫一妻咧？如果婚姻淨係話生殖，其實同配種有乜有乜分別咧？冇分別嘅喎。

156
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:09,770
即係我哋公民黨係即係希望政府係認認真真去做好今次呢個性別承認法，去解決即係唔同嘅問題。當然喺一啲恐懼同埋喺跨性別人士嘅權益當中攞一個平衡，我哋係支持嘅呢樣嘢。

157
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:13,540
誒，其實今日我都有聽第一節嗰個公聽會嘅，噉啊越聽咧就覺得越越氣憤嘅，因為咧我發現咧好多人咧都真係唔係好明究竟性別承認法係講啲乜嘢，即係W案裡面講得好清楚係參考二零零四年嘅一個英國嘅性別承認法令，裡面講得好清楚有一個嘅審查。

158
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:42,980
呢個審財小組原來真係咁兒戲㗎。男轉女又得，女轉男又得嘅喎。我係咪今日就可係女性，聽日就係男性咧？事情唔係噉樣嘅嘛，即係主席。即係我想講一樣嘢，就係大家都話一個誒跨性別嘅女性入女士，大家好驚，明白嘅、瞭解嘅，因為見到男性嘅生殖器官啊嘛。

159
00:29:42,980 --> 00:30:02,990
咁但係調翻轉頭一個跨性別嘅男性，但係佢行政嘅嗰個黑方身份證上面仲係一個女性，佢入女嘅洗手間、女嘅更衣室，大家又驚唔驚咧？即係不能夠將成件事只係針對於某一個角落發大嚟講㗎嘛？呢件事噉樣係唔啱㗎嘛？正如頭先第一節。

160
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:55,140
咁噉，其實我哋重要呢個婚姻嚟做乜嘢咧？咁但係如果唔係喎，你哋話我要愛同尊重嘅，咁點解你哋又唔立法去禁止離婚啊？立法去禁止其他誒濫越婚姻嘅事情喺裏面，或者立法保護我哋下一代咧？其實呢啲説話真係好難聽。咁所以，我哋係支持係立呢個性別承認法，亦都希望。

161
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,810
我反對政府設立性別承認制度。

162
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,390
有三個原因，為何我們支持那項立法？

163
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,140
firstly, it would help to prevent discrimination against them.

164
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,540
反而正確同埋健康嘅兩性觀念咧，同埋女性嘅權益都唔被重視。

165
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:45,150
倫敦嘅地鐵廣播已經唔再係講各位先生女士ladies and gentlemen，反而係講各位好hello everyone。

166
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:45,540
for that reason, the EOC fully supports the introduction of comprehensive gender recognition legislation, which fully respects their human rights.

167
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:56,660
和的引入，的全面，反歧視法，律，覆蓋，性別，認同，

168
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:07,520
但最 importantly，the discrimination they face is often linked to the inconsistency between their identity documents and their affirmed gender.

169
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:28,640
英國已經實施咗性別承認制度十幾年，間接造成咗一種新文化。無論係政府、民間機構、學校，都要推行跨性別友善政策。

170
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:12,850
和自由，我們要保護個人隱私，和自由，我們

171
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:10,700
我們也 note that we've previously made submissions to both the government, the IWG and the Marriage Amendment Bill Committee on these issues, supporting the introduction of gender recognition legislation.

172
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:21,630
我們也自2002年以來，收到53起歧視同性戀人士的投訴，發生在類似領域，例如就業、俱樂部、教育、服務及政府職能。

173
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:38,140
在二零一六年一月，我們發表了一份全面的報告，是我們委託中國大學進行的一項研究，關於引入反歧視法規，涵蓋性取向、性別認同和跨性別身份。

174
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:55,920
The study included focus groups with a number of transgender people, which clearly highlighted that they face discrimination in many areas of public life, including employment, provision of services, education and government functions.

175
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:40,580
第二個 reason， 我們支持 gender recognition regulation， 是，The absence of it is not compliant with key international human rights obligations and recommendations which have been made by the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.

176
00:34:41,020 --> 00:35:01,030
第三ly， we support the introduction of legislation to remove existing requirements of sex reassignment surgery， which clearly breaches both international and Hong Kong's human rights obligations in terms of the right to be free from inhumane and degrading treatment.

177
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,300
八十間。

178
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,110
為咗避免跨性別學生覺得自己被排擠。

179
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,400
你包括嗰啲覺得自己係男人嘅孕婦。

180
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,220
要向性別診所求診嘅細路仔大增。

181
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,690
就要咧係接受紀律聆訊，可能連份工都冇得做。

182
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,870
英國嘅女童軍已經係畀嗰啲覺得自己係女性嘅男仔同埋男人加入，甚至可以做童軍領袖。

183
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:49,110
早前劍橋大學核下一間嘅女子學院係宣佈會收嗰啲自己覺得係女人嘅男人入讀。

184
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:53,090
公立嘅中學同埋小學係推行性別中立嘅校服政策，學生可以著，就算係男仔都可以著裙翻學。

185
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:12,760
為咗避免冒犯跨性別人士，國家統計局建議下一次人口普查嘅時候，唔要求人民一定要報上自己嘅性別。

186
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:41,410
變裝皇后亦都可以入到七間嘅託兒所讀故事書畀兩歲以上嘅細路仔，教佢哋可以選擇做男仔或者係女仔。

187
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:22,860
對跨性別學生唔再叫佢男仔或者係女仔嘅he或者係she，而係有一個新嘅代名詞係he，而set he。

188
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:34,850
最近有個老師，佢叫咗個女跨男嘅學生做女仔，即使係好快道歉，都畀家長投訴，畀學校停職。

189
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:58,490
最近英國政府建議聯合國修改《公民權利同埋政治權利國際公約》第六條，將當中所講嘅懷孕女人改為懷孕人士。

190
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:26,150
雖然性別認證法只係容許成人申請，但係法例已經影響咗下一代，越嚟越多嘅細路仔有性別不安嘅問題，幾歲大就變裝成為異性。

191
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:11,100
學界亦都推行新嘅詞語，老師唔再叫學生全體學生做男仔或者女仔boys and girls，而係要改叫class或者pupils，全班同學。

192
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:12,690
同啲女仔一齊過夜，我哋想將來嘅香港變成點咧？我哋係咪想女校一定要收男生，男校一定要收女生？我哋係咪想男仔誒可以着裙翻學同埋去女廁？

193
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,730
性別。

194
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,740
下一位李亮神父。

195
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,680
而家建議所引進嘅一啲嘅法律。

196
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,430
都唔會支持任何實際上。

197
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,480
因此咧，天主教會唔能夠接受。

198
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,520
香港唔應該成立呢個性別承認制度，唔該。

199
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,780
或者係咧所謂重置嘅性別，但係天主教會相信。

200
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:35,590
有時被視為咧一種嘅社會嘅結構，但實際上咧。

201
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,240
佢同人天生嘅生理呢個性別咧，係有不可分割嘅關係。

202
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,960
天主教會確認咧，每一個人不論性別，都有同等嘅內在價值同埋尊嚴。

203
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:51,060
男性嘅特質或者女性特質唔可能由任人咧係任由人咧自行去選擇、操控或者隨意去改變。

204
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:37,230
唔單止唔會對公眾有利，反而會咧為個別嘅人士、家庭同社會整體嘅福祉咧帶嚟負面嘅影響，尤其是喺撫養同教育子女依兩方面。

205
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:12,130
心理上成長嘅正常嘅咧係秩序，但係如果呢啲嘅兒童日後喺意念上有所改變，或者證實咧係診斷上有錯誤嘅話咧，咁再次翻轉頭逆轉過嚟咧係咧係非常之困難嘅事。

206
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:17,720
不但違反剛才嗰個基本原則，而且更加以咧懲罰性嘅法律去強制執行嘅一種嘅性別承認嘅制度，不論係咧我哋人係被逼去咧承認嘅性別係經過或者未經過醫療手術嚟達到嘅所謂自選嘅性別，所謂喜好嘅性別。

207
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,570
亦都影響私營機構同個體個別市民。

208
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,430
只有經男女雙方嘅自由和完全嘅同意，先至會訂婚。

209
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:07,330
誒聯合國喺一九六六年通過兩項有關人權嘅公約，公民權利和。

210
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:58,830
如果唔係嘅話，將來受害嘅就只會係大眾。我哋係反對香港實施性別承認制度嘅。

211
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:28,600
字或其他見解，國籍或社會出身、財產、出生或其他嘅身份。

212
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:38,950
等任何地區。第三條，本盟約第約各國承擔保證男子和婦女，即係man and woman，在。

213
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:39,330
嘅第三十九條，亦都係定明呢兩項嘅公約係適用於香港有關嘅規定，係繼續會實施，通過香港特別行政區嘅法律咧，係施予實施嘅。

214
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:51,100
盟約所在嘅一切經濟、社會及文化權利方面有平等權利。第十條，本第約第約各國承認一對於。

215
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:53,690
公民權利同埋政治權利嘅國際公約嘅第二十三條二講到係已達至結婚年齡嘅男女，即係man and woman，訂婚和成立家庭嘅權利應該被承認。第三。

216
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:50,110
陳下一位陳燕芬女士，大家好。首先，我想相信在場有人咧，可能係會講一啲好慘嘅故事，但係亦都好想大家知道實際嘅狀況都係要顧及大眾嘅安全同埋社會倫理嘅結構。

217
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:34,920
工作小組咧提交一份更加詳盡嘅回應文件，教會都會繼續誠意噉樣喺聯同其他嘅有關人士繼續研究相關議題，嚟尋求咧符合公眾利益，第一二咧係按照公義嘅睇呢個咧具體方案嚟咧以慈悲都係符合倫理道德嘅度咧關心咧係得。

218
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:57,870
天主教會特別關注到兒童嘅福利，例如咧係對嗰啲被診斷為咧患有性別不安嘅兒童，如果使用咧係青春期嘅荷爾蒙呢啲嘅阻斷劑，尤其對佢係好危險，因為呢種嘅幹預方式徹底嚟破壞青春期裏邊咧生理同。

219
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:32,420
嗱，如果性別承認法律係獲得通過嘅話咧，其後個後果咧可以包括啲咩嘢咧？係包括公共政策上所引發嘅問題，例如咧係使用特別係咧男性或女性嗰啲提供嗰啲設施同設備嘅時候咧，或譬如咧用公共嘅廁所或者係咧浴室或者係咧係參加特定嘅性別。

220
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:52,430
嘅體育運動嘅時候咧，依啲嘅情況下會使到婦女咧失去應有嘅安全感、保護咧同埋公平嘅競爭。但咧，我哋係咧要注意性別承認法律咧，係同埋咧可能係藉住依啲法律而咧係被鼓吹嘅依啲嘅性別意識嘅形態，佢嘅後果咧會伸延到各方面，唔單止影響公營嘅機。

221
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:16,070
可能產生後果咧，會包括逆向歧視，使到宗教自由同良心自由，或者係咧係同埋，或者係咧對學校教育同校裏學校裏邊嘅其他嘅政策嘅自主權帶嚟咗咧好大嘅威脅。嗱咧，天主教會會喺咧係政府諮詢期截止之前咧，會再向係咧跨部門咧係嘅。

222
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:27,750
政治權利國際公約，另外就係經濟、社會與文化權利嘅國際公約，都係喺一九六六年獲得聯合國大會通過嘅。而呢兩項咧喺一九七六年咧係開始生效，並且同年係擴展到香港適用嘅。而香港基本法。

223
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,680
噉，更何況係。

224
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,370
明顯地係話畀大家聽，誒嗰個可以生B.B.嘅一定係生理上嗰個女性。

225
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:05,290
根本本身就係跨性別嘅人士咧，我想大家知道咧，其實咧跨性別呢一個狀態咧，唔係一個選擇嚟嘅。

226
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:28,140
字咧就因為其實我哋都呢個小組啦，都聽咗好多唔同嘅意見，亦都好多唔同嘅公眾嘅資訊，聽咗好多人咧，其實係唔明白咩叫做跨性別人士。

227
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:38,770
亦都唔知道原來跨性別人士嘅心理狀態啦，個狀況係啲咩嘢？咁其實咧，我哋聽落去咧係好痛心，同埋聽落去係好心痛嘅，因為其實。

228
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:17,900
我自己咧係一個同性戀者，可能喺三十年前、四十年前，大家會講同性戀，你都唔符合社會嘅傳統啦，又唔係本地，唔係香港人嘅價值。

229
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:43,520
其實嗌呢個作為病，其實依係一種傷害。我哋冇必要喺唔明白嘅情況之下，就嗌咗一個人做個病人咧，而嗌人去醫咧，有冇人中意畀人話自己係變態，係個disorder咧？大家可以考慮一下。

230
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:50,390
我希望過咗三十年之後，我哋嘅討論再唔會係，哦，佢哋係跨性別嘅，佢啊噉啊睇醫生咯，做手術，身體發諸受於父母，你唔尊重你父母嘅咩？你男人中唔中意男人啊？你男人中唔中唔做男人啊？

231
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:55,080
如果大家唔明白呢一個狀態，然後有好多批判，有好多意見，甚至有歧視，甚至有不滿，甚至可能陳志全而頭先講咧有仇視呢啲，我哋作為第三者聽落去嘅時候咧，都覺得好痛苦。

232
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:34,880
你哋唔明白，你覺得佢係一個男人，點解要揀自己係一個男人啊？今日一樣，我哋唔明白咩叫做跨性別，唔明白心理性別同埋生理性別嘅不同帶嚟嘅影響、帶嚟嘅掙扎、帶嚟社會嘅包袱。

233
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:19,780
經濟、下社會和文化權利嘅國際公約嘅第二條二，本文約第約各國承認保證，本第約所宣佈嘅權利受與普遍施行，而不而不得有例如種族、膚色、性別、語言、宗教、政。

234
00:43:51,380 --> 00:44:11,390
作為社會嘅自然和基本嘅單位嘅家庭，特別是對於他即係家庭嘅建立和當他即係家庭負責照顧和教育未獨立嘅兒童嘅時候，應給予儘可能廣泛嘅保育和協助。第三必須經。

235
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:31,400
個男女雙方嘅自由同意。第二，對於母親，即係mothers，在產前和產後嘅合理假期應給予特別嘅保護。喺呢段時間，對於母親係要畀誒，即係有產假嘅喺呢度咧，係特別講明咧，婦女咧係就係指一個自然出生嘅女性。咁所以其實好明。

236
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:58,510
好，我想大家去好清楚睇我哋嘅誒意見回應。我係用足我自己嘅誠意嚟到去寫嘅，唔該。多謝你。誒，下一位李逸豪先生，係主席你好，大家好。誒，我係今日代表性別承認法嘅公眾諮詢嘅跨學科工作小組發言嘅。噉我哋工作小組咧就同。

237
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:18,520
同咗誒平機會啦、香港大學啦、同埋安瑞國際律師行同埋其他組織，尤其是咧係同咗跨性別人士啦、同埋雙性別人士咧整咗呢個小冊子嘅。噉我都歡迎政府啦、工作小組啦、同埋立法會嘅議員咧去睇呢個小冊子，去知多啲究竟咩叫做跨性別人士。咁點解要提呢個小？

238
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,360
而家識摩咧，入類似犯案嘅風險。

239
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,070
跨城人都係人，請給跨城人一條可活嘅生路。

240
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:34,440
喺每一部分嘅議題裏邊咧，都只係重複，佢並冇一個取代。

241
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:56,080
如果呢一班家長係咁關心教育嘅正確性同埋自主性嘅話，咁喺國教洗腦喺李飛直播事件上面，點解佢一粒聲都唔出咧？

242
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:39,760
早前跨女Jaco佢跳橋嘅自殺事件引嚟廣泛關注，事後警方依然咧喺傳媒嘅面前咧稱呼事主為男性。

243
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:50,790
喺未有性別承認法之下，Jaco到離世嘅一刻，仍然被剝奪自我認同嘅性別身份。我盼望政府唔好等到悲劇重演，然後先至承認。

244
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:48,090
香港應該多多參考，就係好似台灣喺中小學持之以恆嘅性別平等教育，去教育嗰啲而家仲口口聲聲話性別只係得天生一種，以及係反對性別從治嘅人。

245
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:18,930
但係經查證之後，發現資料來源不明不實。就算真係有個別噉樣嘅例子，我哋要懲治嘅其實係嗰啲變態性貿，而唔係一刀切噉，係將呢個跨性別妖魔化為同一樣嘅所謂病態行為。

246
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:08,010
好，下一位何秀蘭女士。係啊，多謝主席。我今日係代表工黨表達立場，係支持呢個誒性別承認制度嘅設立。嗱，成個諮詢文件咧係有一個好大嘅問題。

247
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:30,560
但係最重要嘅係跨性人無需被逼進行非自願性嘅全套重置手術，先至可以轉換身份證嘅性別。而重置性別身份亦都應該賦予合法嘅法律地位，保障佢哋嘅基本公民權。

248
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:36,790
亦都有團體表示，通過法案之後會強逼學校教育多元性別教育，仲誇大其詞話灌輸兒童多元性別觀念咧，就係弱兒行為。佢哋有冇諗過阻礙兒童去認識經過科學驗證嘅全面性別觀念，先至係窒礙兒童正常嘅心智發展咧？

249
00:46:50,670 --> 00:47:10,680
呢啲説話好難聽，因為呢啲説話係大部分人唔會明白嘅。我自己係同性戀，九十個percent嘅人都唔係同性戀，佢哋可能唔會明白我心理狀態。我自己都冇辦法完完全全明白跨性別人哋嘅狀態，但係我從來都唔會去講噉啊。你就跟住我嘅方法去做啦，因為我係大眾，我覺得噉係可以嘅。

250
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:30,690
至於頭先有好多人都講啦，世衞組織覺得呢樣嘢係個病。我想大家知道咧，其實世衞咧喺今年同埋下年咧準備會開會咧，佢哋其實大部分嘅人咧已經係諗緊點樣將跨性別呢一個狀態咧，除去喺呢一個病態嘅list裏面㗎啦。然後丹麥咧今年已經唔再話呢樣嘢做一個病，所以大家要考慮係。

251
00:47:44,220 --> 00:48:04,230
好多謝你。下一位啊，梁兆輝先生，主席。誒，個我喺香港電台主持嘅同志節目《自己人》咧，我先後訪問過好多誒本地嘅一啲跨性別人士，從佢哋口中咧聽到好多真實嘅故事。有位跨女，本來咧滿心歡喜係終於可以排期做變性手術，但係臨門一腳咧係打退堂鼓，因為佢好怕自己本來已經係多病嘅身體係。

252
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:24,240
承受唔起咧手術嘅創傷同埋風險。有位跨女係任職I.T.部門，佢親屬要喺同事面前經歷由男變女transitioning嗰種惶恐嘅過程。有位跨仔表示，為免上工次製造誤會同埋事端，佢選擇每一次出街都唔飲水。亦都有位雙性人話畀我知道，由出生去到青春期，佢被強行係做過。

253
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:44,250
十數次非自願性而且失敗嘅變性手術，導致嚴重身心傷害。我作為一個男同志，並唔能夠完全明白跨性人嘅心理需要同埋狀況，好似Henry所講，因為一個人嘅性傾向同埋佢嘅性別認同咧，係冇必然嘅關係。呢個要特別講畀阿邵家輝知嘅。咁但係不完全明白。

254
00:48:44,250 --> 00:49:04,260
並唔表示唔能夠諒解同情，因為人之為人，你同埋我都應該有基本嘅同理心。呢啲故事揭示咗跨性別人士喺歧視滿布、沒有任何性別身份保障之下嘅香港社會，過住幾咁艱苦無助、邊緣嘅生活。近日有團體擺街站，誒導引咩外國嘅例子，危言聳聽話法案通過之後咧，大大會增

255
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,880
Dear Chairman and others and panelists.

256
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,730
呢個係絕對不負責任嘅態度。我亦都請林鄭咧。

257
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,620
依法複核去爭取平權嘅啫。好，下一位Miss Louise，嗯。

258
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,460
我， together with thirty others, have jointly submitted a written submission to the to the panel on gender recognition.

259
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:29,110
在Submission，我們有表達我們的 reservations 意見，關於設立一個 gender 認可方案在香港。今天，我們想請我們的政府打中間地。

260
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:08,660
佢係要遵守政教分離呢個原則，唔可以將佢自己個人嘅宗教傳識混入去公共行政裏邊。

261
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:44,920
多嘅風化案或者性侵犯，其實性侵犯只係基於一個個人嘅品行行為同性別同埋性別承認性取向係絕冇關係嘅。咁其實呢啲問題咧。

262
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:16,380
我咁代表大愛同盟敦促政府應該要順應法院嘅建議，引入英國較寬鬆嘅性別承認法。較寬鬆並唔代表係毫無規管，跨性人依然需要係經過心理嘅評估啦，同埋生活體驗，而非單純係透過自我宣示噉樣就可以化解嗰啲咩什麼誒今日可以誒中意變男，聽日中意可以變女嘅荒謬言。

263
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:28,300
最大嘅問題咧，就係佢不斷去強調自己冇立場，但係喺政府保障每一個人平等權利、消除歧視呢方面嘅立場咧，應該係絕對不能含糊，應該係清晰鮮明嘅。咁但係咧，當局就真係喺。

264
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:54,730
我引用前平機會主席週一牛醫生一句説話：，歧視唔係一個權利，係政府不能夠坐視不理。不過咧，我哋見到特區誒新一屆嘅行政長官阿林鄭咧，佢喺回應大家爭取到同志運動會嘅時候，仲話係要聽社會其他議。

265
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:28,950
嗱，文件咧，佢冇確立到消除歧視係政府責任呢個大前提，反為咧係用生活上邊好多共處可能引起嘅疑惑，或者法律上邊未清楚之處咧，去引起更大嘅擔心。嗱，最簡單咧就係有好多人都講話共用更衣室咧，係會引起更

266
00:52:45,200 --> 00:53:05,210
只要政府係增加資源，設立多一啲獨立嘅洗手間同埋誒淋浴間就可以解決。但係文件咧，不但冇提出呢啲簡易嘅解決方法，仲更加強化變性人都可能有性侵犯意圖嘅恐懼。呢個咧係撕裂社會啊！最令人擔心咧～

267
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:25,220
就係當局將外國所講嘅雙軌制咧偷換概念，係想話企圖咧推出香港一個變種嘅雙軌制。嗱，外國嘅雙軌制咧就係接受非經全套變性手術，只係經過心理輔導或者係何以？

268
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:45,230
蒙誒療程嘅人就可以取得同等嘅法律權利。咁但係香港誒呢套諮詢文件咧，就係同樣有兩個程序，但係後邊咧係冇相同嘅法律權利。呢個即係倒退到翻去二零一四年婚姻修訂條例嗰個嚴苛嘅。

269
00:53:45,230 --> 00:54:05,240
要求就係要大家做一個可以攞命嘅辯勝過程，然後先正允許佢去誒取得一個法定嘅地位嗱。本來法院咧係將呢個改變社會政策權利交翻畀政府，但係而家政府咁做咧，只係逼市民不斷去花錢、花時間尋求私。

270
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:58,860
stint。

271
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,360
and。

272
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:37,740
Of the employer, for example, we do not wish to see a church being forced to marry a biologically same-sex couple.

273
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:56,110
87% completely or somewhat disagreed with or felt neutral about the statement that transgender people are immoral.

274
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:46,810
81% completely or somewhat disagreed with or were neutral about the statement that transgender people should be avoided whenever possible.

275
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:24,820
74% completely agreed or somewhat agreed that people should be free to express their gender identity. Only 12% either somewhat or completely disagreed.

276
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:23,180
那係做正你反對嘅，即係排擠唔同嘅人。多謝。多謝。接下來係Professor Kelly Lopes。好，多謝。

277
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:54,130
The survey included 26 questions about LGBT issues and I'll focus now on those related to transgender people and will provide more details in our submission to the IWG next month.

278
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:37,200
70% completely or somewhat agreed that they would accept an openly transgender work colleague, 15% were neutral and 14% somewhat or completely disagreed.

279
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:12,130
C. In most cases, coupled with hormonal replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgeries. Why do we need such rigorous and stringent criteria? Because a person's gender change is supposed to be permanent.

280
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:32,450
它有 ramifications in every aspect of that person's life and the people around him or her. Think public toilets and change rooms. Most importantly, rigorous and stringent criteria would prevent abuse of the system, and it shows that the government does not pass laws purely based upon personal preferences.

281
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:42,530
作為 part of a project hosted by the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at Hong Kong U, we commissioned the Hong Kong U Social Science Research Centre to conduct a public opinion telephone survey of a representative sample of Hong Kong adults in May and June of 2017. 1,437 people responded.

282
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:49,460
在developed society such as Hong Kong, we think it is fair to say that in terms of issues such as gender recognition, there is no one absolute right view nor wrong view. Therefore, we think that the government should do its best to balance the interests of all parties concerned, and to do it, do its best not to create a divided society.

283
00:54:49,460 --> 00:55:09,470
我們會因此建議，一個性別認同方案在香港應該不被建立，或相關法律不被通過，除非和直到有措施和法律在位，以確保不會有對言論自由、宗教自由和父母權利的破壞，這是香港人民的基本權利。例如。

284
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:29,480
我們唔會希望見幼稚園或小學兒童被故意教關於性別中立或性別流動概念。在學校，我們唔見得呢個係適齡亦都唔係必要。例如，我們唔會希望見一名員工被解僱，因為他唔贊同或唔同意多元性別。

285
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:58,030
我們也會建議，如果性別認可方案要設立於香港，應確保它不是基於自我陳述模式。它應基於A，專業診斷性別不適症候羣；B，足夠長的實生活測試。兩年太短，在就業環境中，兩年被稱為兩年。

286
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:52,740
最後，我們認為重要的是，政府應該確保兒童被診斷為性別 dysphoria，應該 not 被鼓勵轉變到對面性別，因為研究顯示性別 dysphoria 不是結論性天生的，和外部因素，例如在懷孕期間使用雌激素類藥物、缺陷的人際連結和嬰兒撫養。

287
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,400
喂，係誒。

288
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,590
only 21% completely or somewhat agreed that transgender people make them nervous.

289
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:55,470
最後一點，在最近的論文，我的合作者Professor Holning Lau從大學的北卡羅萊納，他是一個著名的專家在LGBT權利。

290
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:25,920
其他questions produce similar results and overall, the survey demonstrates a high level of public acceptance of and support for transgender people and their rights in Hong Kong.

291
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:14,660
68% completely or somewhat agreed that Hong Kong should have a law that protects people from discrimination because they are transgender, and only 10% completely disagreed.

292
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:09,050
has cogently clarified that international human rights law gives rise to a human right to gender recognition, and that the reasons put forward for limiting this right cannot be justified and are not proportionate.

293
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:26,710
相關國際 provisions 也係香港法的一部分，政府必須仔細評估任何方案，以確保它符合香港的國內和國際人權法律義務。多謝。多謝。下一位馮憲文先生。

294
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:45,690
although the introduction of policies that protect the rights of a minority should not be contingent on majority support, I think these survey results help counter any arguments against a gender recognition scheme based on claims of insufficient social acceptance of transgender people in Hong Kong.

295
00:56:52,740 --> 00:57:12,750
都 play a part， and more than 80% of children suffering from gender dysphoria will naturally be freed of such conditions by adolescence. Lastly, we hope that both sides of the issue should have an open mind and continue to respect each other. Please do not give each other labels or names. Don't say to a person who doesn't agree with gender dysphoria as transphobic or bigot.

296
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:14,420
The results indicate that 59% of the Hong Kong public is either very accepting or moderately accepting of transgender people. 22% were a little accepting and only 19% were not at all accepting. So, in other words, a significant majority of 81% expressed some level of acceptance of transgender people.

297
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:48,690
誒制度係人用嘅，噉我諗應該可以，可以喺誒誒跨性別嘅呢一個角度去睇一睇，到底佢哋想要啲乜嘢噉樣啦。咁其實咧，誒你想咗下，你係一個跨男啦。咁其實你咧，其實去到最尾嘅時候，你都係想要一個正常嘅生活啦。咁其實可能你就係做過，即係你已經係試過conform喺誒即係女性嘅生活入邊，但問題你覺得唔適合啦。你知道其他好似菲律

298
01:00:48,690 --> 01:01:08,700
賓以前等等嘅文化入邊，其實係有誒第唔止男同埋女嘅性別嘅。咁同埋誒，其實你見到外國有誒research就係話，其實誒基本上而家係有你做腦電圖，你係有實質嘅證據證明男即係誒女跨男啦，即係跨仔啦。其實佢個腦咧係同正常嘅男性咧，其實個wire嘅方式咧係好相似。即係基本上其實有實質嘅證據證明佢哋。

299
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:28,710
唔係，只不過係有一個嘅偏好，唔係有一個嘅癖好，而係真係有實質嘅證據證明嘅時候，咁其實誒係咪即係其實係咪就要話呢一班人其實就係誒即係我唔理到呢個係一個病定係一個condition，但係我就覺得呢個唔可以喺法律上面就go unaddressed，即係基本上唔可以outlaw呢一班人咯。咁其實再break down啦，即係我係贊成呢一樣嘢，但如果我

300
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:48,720
我哋唔可以就係通過，就係可能就話有誒自己嘅declaration，又或者係有誒即係醫生證明噉就可以轉到呢一個label嘅話，我嚟我就可以願意即係根本，我覺得其實係set up for一個誒即係一個誒權宜之計係可以嘅，即係好似話其實誒最後嗰個need就係乜嘢咧？就係想性制度上面承認呢一班嘅transgender，因為佢哋真係存在㗎嘛，你唔可以隱形化咗佢哋㗎嘛。

301
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,680
13個月。

302
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,600
Thank you。下位Miss楊嘉慧。

303
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,900
The judicial review was filed to challenge.

304
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,710
不可分割的人權，尤其是minority rights。Thank you.

305
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:01,290
The treatment heavily limited the development of male features during puberty, and hence she looks and speaks like a woman.

306
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:26,630
just want to quote Jeffrey Ma and just a reminder of this debate and Jeffrey Ma in the W case, he says.

307
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:37,820
即係你可以限制自己嘅行為，唔係限制其他人嘅噉樣咯。咁性環誒跨性跨性跨性別一個正常生活嘅機會，多謝好。誒，下一位，Mr. Mark Daly。

308
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:18,810
Scheme, we support the self-declaration model, and find that, and and firmly oppose any required medical treatment models as breaching the fundamental human rights of the person, and.

309
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:39,410
at all times she was placed in an all male detention facility, strip searched on multiple occasions, ridiculed and refused hormone treatment for close to eight months during which she was traumatized due to the development of male physical characteristics on her body.

310
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:54,620
Yeah, Mark Daly, our law firm has a number of LGBT cases. One case in particular highlights the lack of legislation and policies in the detention area. It involves a trans woman who's been receiving hormone treatment since before puberty.

311
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:26,840
其實一個核心家，即係可能要都係傳統嘅家庭都係想嘅話，要延續血脈，噉係咪領養小朋友其實都唔應該咧？即係其實基本上到底係由即係有冇個血緣關係，到底嗰個嘅誒，即係chromosome入邊到底係有X、Y定XX，係咪真係有咁重要？定係其實你其實其實相處係比較重要咧？咁仲有宗教就係其實我覺得誒。

312
01:01:48,790 --> 01:02:08,800
第二就係其實都係想要翻個正常嘅生活，咁所以要畀翻個可以，就做翻個制度畀佢哋，畀佢可以過翻個正常嘅生活。噉我諗其實都明白，就係其實有好多個團體，即係好似婦女團體啦，或者其他團體有其他嘅關心。噉我覺得其實可以係製咗一個middle，即係有一個middle ground出嚟咯。即係好似話其實誒，我會set up一個標簽，即係可能就係話誒喺即係可以填。

313
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:28,810
除咗誒，即係生理性別之外，可能仲有先生啊、小姐，又或者係心理性別都可以填埋上去。咁當然，但可能會造成公眾嘅混亂，所以我覺得其實加咗個性別嘅標簽，可能先生、小姐等等呢個係可以接受嘅。咁第二就係話誒，其實咧可能有女性就會驚喺更衣室入面見到男性嘅同體啦，咁會唔會就可能我哋就係中間再立多少少嘅法咯？就可能就係話限制咗誒。

314
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:48,820
大眾又真可能就係限制跨性別，我都覺得O.K.嘅，就係你限制咗佢喺個更衣室入邊可以使用嘅範圍，即係寧願就係我放棄一啲嘅權利去，即係做到一個過多嘅正常生活，其實都可以一個即係可以即係我呢個係一個可以考慮嘅一個方法咯。咁同埋其實長期嚟講，其實其實好多嘅即係歧視都係源自不於不理解啦。其實我覺得應該要係做一。

315
01:02:48,820 --> 01:03:08,830
多啲又關於係性少眾，即係包括同性戀、跨性別，又或者係誒雙性人等等嘅，有啲嘅性性教育，而唔係淨係講緊就係話誒避孕，就係當即係講避孕就已經當佢係已經係講咗性教育咯。咁最後其實就係講到，即係其實頭先誒誒，其實一個地方講得好好嘅就係一個家庭就話會影響咗佢嗰個核心嘅價值。咁好啦，咁其實另一個小朋友。

316
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:21,580
她 had breast augmentation surgery at the age of eighteen, but due to financial reasons only, she has not undergone sex reassignment surgery. Regrettably, she was convicted in Hong Kong and sentenced to imprisonment. She was incarcerated in both Pickock and Sualam psychiatric centre for around.

317
01:04:43,190 --> 01:05:03,200
the policies or the lack of proper policies to deal with such people and treat them with dignity, and the case was heard in August 2016 and is still pending, so that's just one particular area, one particular example. We we agree that there's a need for Hong Kong to introduce a gender recognition.

318
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:47,040
reliance on the absence of a majority consensus as a reason for rejecting a minority's claim is inimical, in principle, to fundamental rights. And this is echoed by the chief justice of Ireland. He says, how can resort to the will of a majority dictate the decisions of a court whose role it is to interpret universal and

319
01:05:54,030 --> 01:06:14,040
各位好！彩虹支約共建同志友善教會行動，簡稱彩約，係一個由十一個團體組成嘅聯盟。我哋願意同性小眾，特別係性小眾基督徒同行。我哋相信社會必須要聆聽性小眾嘅掙扎，按性小眾真實嘅需要提供適切嘅牧養，建立一個安全、尊重、接納、信任嘅環境，等性小眾同埋。

320
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:34,050
同埋性小眾基督徒可以參與社會同埋教會生活，接納性小眾受洗，參與聖餐，可以選擇結婚或者唔結婚，能夠平等參與侍奉。但係呢啲都係教會嘅事。但係更重要嘅係，我哋支持所有性小眾同異性戀者一同享有平等嘅公民權利，因為我哋認為歧視並唔係福音。所

321
01:06:54,060 --> 01:07:00,610
有男女二元性別嘅社會法律系統，雙性人常常都被視為異類。過往甚至而家嘅香港。

322
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:15,560
係需要成個社會嚟到係去接受，但係亦都係有好多嘅代價係要去付出。

323
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:23,130
我哋其實咧，亦都唔應該咧，即係強加於呢一樣嘢喺其他唔認同嘅人嘅身上。

324
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:34,190
女性嘅話，噉我而家可以話畀你聽，有啲人係一齣世就係雙性人，有兩個生理嘅性徵，更甚者喺得唔到當時人，即係呢啲雙性人B B嘅允許或者同意底下。

325
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:28,230
如果你自己都唔尊重翻你自己，咁又點可以要求人哋去尊重你咧？我嘅意思就係你有冇真心真意咁去愛過你自己，與生俱來嘅自己？

326
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:41,360
我覺得其實誒，真正嘅人權就係佢哋係可以有自己去有呢個教育、享受教育嘅自由，可以去享受自己去選擇嘅工作，但係唔係話我哋噉樣就要全其他嘅人一齊去陪佢咯。

327
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:54,060
我哋選擇出席今日呢場會議，我哋嘅聯盟當中包括關心本地雙性人權益嘅組織，凡嚟以外認識及關愛雙性人。今日代表其中一啲雙性人、本地雙性人聲音嘅細細老師冇辦法出席，所以我今日發言側重嘅部分將會係性別性刑法同埋雙性人嘅權益。喺只一

328
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:20,900
啊！醫療系統同埋社會常常都強加男女二元性別嘅期望喺雙性人身上，要求雙性人自一齣世起就需要歸喺男女性別底下，否定雙性人嘅原生生理性別同埋實際嘅身體狀況。所以，如果有朋友話一個人生出嚟只係得男性或者係，

329
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:54,480
我哋嘅社會同埋醫療系統就強行為呢一啲雙性而作出性器官嘅修改手術，務求令到呢一啲雙性人喺世界入面消失，係令到雙性人嘅身心都受到極大嘅傷害，亦都失去咗基本嘅人權同埋尊重。呢啲都係因為香港並沒有承認雙性人存在嘅性別承認法同埋。

330
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:14,490
法案如果冇性別承認法，如果要求所有人都需要進行性器官手術先可以得到當事人嘅自我確認嘅性別身份，咁即係等於強迫所有香港嘅雙性人承受身心殘酷嘅對待，亦都會間接促使雙性人嘅家長同埋醫療專業人士繼續深。

331
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:34,500
相信為呢啲雙性人孩童私人殘酷嘅性器官手術係理所當然嘅。我哋極唔願意以上嘅情況繼續發生。成日有人話家長家長、兒童兒童咁雙性人嘅家長咧，雙性人嘅兒童咧，佢哋嘅權益喺邊度？佢哋嘅平安喺邊度啊？真係唔好再亂咁提聯合國。聯合國咧仍然都有一條叫做酷刑條。

332
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:54,510
條約㗎。如果一個人唔希望做手術，你然後強逼佢做，咁即係點啊？即係你需要有良心，然後你就要一刀刧落人哋度啊！呢個係乜嘢野蠻嘅邏輯啊？我哋相信每一個人生而為人都應該擁有對自己身體嘅身體自主性，所以我哋肯請諮詢小組以及政府必須同時正視。

333
01:08:54,510 --> 01:09:14,520
而雙性人同跨性別嘅基本人權，訂立一個有尊重同埋有善精神嘅性別承認法。多謝，多謝。誒，下一位鄧明心女士，誒，多謝主席。本人咧就係反對呢個性別認同條例嘅。我覺得咧，即係男人就係男人，女人就係女人，咁咧各自都應該係尊重翻自己。

334
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:48,520
如果有人懷疑，可以驗DNA，可以去做變性手術，可以話去睇精神科醫生去做心理輔導。其實呢一啲佢對對自己嘅懷疑，都係佢自己個人嘅問題。佢有自由去選擇去點樣接受自己，但係佢亦都有責任去處理自己嘅問題，而唔。

335
01:09:48,520 --> 01:10:08,530
唔係要全香港人或者係更加多其他嘅人去認同佢，去扭曲自然同埋反違反呢個天性。其實作為父母家長係有責任去正確教導下一代，讓佢哋有一個正確嘅價值觀，而唔係一句我哋認同咗佢就算數。我哋更加係。

336
01:10:42,320 --> 01:11:02,330
如果你話我哋如果唔係好認同或者唔係好瞭解佢哋嘅心理狀況，咁如果咁講法，有一啲所謂嘅強姦犯，哦，佢唔去強姦人，佢就好似蟻咬咁唔舒服，噉係咪要佢又好痛苦嘅？噉係咪都要立法去保護佢哋咧？又或者一啲殺人犯，其實佢唔

337
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,220
立法咧。

338
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,720
進行各類型嘅手術咧，係去糾正翻手第一次手術產生嘅問題。

339
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:55,880
而要我進行一啲唔係我個人意願嘅手術，其實亦都係極唔為人道嘅。

340
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:04,630
好多謝。嗯，下一位係啊温澤仁先生。

341
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:50,310
係誒睇到即係呢個畀人哋即係夾硬係有要立法嘅時候，我哋就要去接受咧。

342
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:29,680
冇辦法用自己認同嘅性別生活，唔單止為我嘅生活帶嚟重重嘅困擾，亦都令我飽受歧視。

343
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:57,960
我覺得呢一個法一立咧，其實會對大部分人反而係更加唔公平嘅。唔該。

344
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:07,250
我哋都曾經因為噉樣誒而驚動過警察，甚至係畀健身中心係拒絕參加會證。

345
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:05,230
況且香港亦都有好多身體狀健康狀況根本唔適合做手術嘅跨性別人士，現行嘅手術限制根本就係判咗佢哋死刑。

346
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:59,800
女更衣室，可能你都會覺得好驚慌或者不安，但係正正就係因為而家冇一個性別承認嘅制度法律之下，我哋都只可以用女更衣室。

347
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:22,380
所以，如果我想轉換我身份證上面嘅性別嘅話，我只有兩個選擇：一就係為咗轉換性別而進行一啲我唔想做嘅手術；二就係忠於我自己，但係就係冇辦法用自己認同嘅性別生活。無論我選擇邊一條路，都係一條好難行嘅路。

348
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:22,340
殺人會唔安樂噉，係咪要保障佢殺人或者去抒發佢心靈需要嘅權利咧？我哋呢一啲其實係冇辦法明白或者理解佢嗰個諗法。咁但係，我覺得如果係有覺得有唔舒服，或者係有呢個心理需要，係咪應該要去睇醫生，而唔係去要要去？

349
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:43,510
我覺得係令到其他有好多人，既然係咁不安，又或者係咁多要討論嘅空間，或者係需要嘅時候，噉我哋係咪都應該係尊重翻人哋嗰個期望咧？即係大家我哋都認同，我係想保護女性所有需要嘅權利，而唔係話啊，我哋要因為。

350
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:26,370
羅允玲係，sorry，羅允玲係，唔好意思，係羅允玲先生。誒，我係一個跨性別人士。噉我出世嘅性別咧係女性，而我喺一般嘅社交場合咧都會用男性嘅身份打扮嘅。同一時間咧，我都係冇打算做任何嘅性別重置手術嘅。我唔做手術嘅原因係包括。

351
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:46,380
手術係有一定嘅風險，但係如果我個身份證想轉為男性嘅話咧，我就一定需要做性別重置手術。而呢啲入侵性嘅手術咧，除咗一定風險之外咧，亦都唔保證一定會成功嘅，因為無論喺香港或者國外，好多跨性別人士喺手術過後咧，都係要不停咁進入醫院，誒，不停咁再去。

352
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,750
多謝。誒，下一位温澤仁先生。

353
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,310
或者甚至乎會收到相關嘅一啲刑罰。

354
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,100
而香港作為國際都會，每個人都應該享有平等嘅權利。

355
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,860
而其實每一次嘅解釋，亦都等同對於自己嘅身份、性別身份嘅否定。

356
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:13,720
而其實每一次我入女更衣室，我都好需要刻意去解釋，我生理上係女性嘅性別。

357
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:26,250
而喺冇性別承認法嘅保障之下，面對呢啲社會嘅歧視或者係對待，我都只可以啞忍。

358
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:47,170
去證明我嘅所謂性別，人哋都未必會望，反而我除褲嘅呢個動作會畀人當係一個威脅及不雅嘅行為。

359
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:35,000
每一個人只要唔係喺社會上邊做緊一啲傷害人嘅事，佢哋嘅個人選擇都應該備受尊重。

360
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:49,270
所以我哋迫切需要一個有冇手術限制嘅性別承認制度，令到每一個跨性別人士都可以做翻自己。多謝。

361
01:16:51,590 --> 01:17:01,570
而事實上，對好多嘅跨性別人士嚟講，要展示一個同佢性別認同唔相符嘅身份證明文件嘅時候，就好似要佢做一個不啊禁不雅嘅動作一樣。

362
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:44,160
媽媽，我出嚟做嘢嘅時候，男女性之間同工同酬已經基本上唔係一個需要爭取嘅嘢。其實我真係揾唔到一個要成為男性嘅理由，只係除咗因為我性別認同係男性。

363
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:18,890
機會。至於跨性別人士家長方面，有唔少都係擔心佢哋嘅子女嘅健康同埋揾工社交方面嘅情況，擔心佢哋會唔會得到平等機會，會唔會遭受歧視，會唔會適應得好？係仔定係女，未必係佢哋最大嘅關注。

364
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:50,030
我同時其實亦都係一位健美運動員，平時中意去健身房健身，所以我嘅身形都比一般女性較為健碩。而因為我身份證性身份證上邊嘅性別係女性，所以我都只可以入女更衣室。每一次我要入女更衣室，亦都會製造好多誤會。而我相信在場各位女士，如果見到我喺

365
01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:13,130
主席好，各位好。作為一個跨性別人士，我自己好幸運。我三廿二歲先發現自己係一個跨性別，比起其他跨性別朋友，可以少咗好多年嘅掙扎。而噉樣係因為喺之前嗰三十二年裏邊，即使我現實上係以一個女性嘅身份生活，但係實際上我可以好自在咁去表達自己男性嘅一面，唔需要壓抑，亦都唔需要擔心，因此而會受到人哋嘅。

366
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:33,140
嘅指責，女性身份生活嘅經驗話畀我知，同性別有關嘅限制真係有好多，包括身體、婚姻狀態、機會，以至於命運。其實，當我以前以一個女性身份去生活嘅時候，我已經係屬於幸運嘅一個。比起以前嘅女性，例如比起我太嫲，我唔需要執腳；比起我阿嫲，讀書讀到中學已經係我基本嘅權利；比起我阿。

367
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,850
女士。

368
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,810
去進行規劃。

369
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,670
下一位誒李美賢。

370
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,590
其實我知道跨性別部門工作小組已經做咗好多嘅研究。

371
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,070
我甚少著裙，但係我仍然。

372
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:04,260
誒，我支持正正法係應該有全面嘅，多謝。

373
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,140
奉主耶穌基督聖明宣告，香港只能夠立呢個屬於神嘅法例。

374
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:09,120
亦都唔係關於究竟係咪外表符唔符合佢自己性別認同嘅嘅問題。香港有唔少嘅少數族裔。

375
01:18:53,240 --> 01:19:00,240
甚至乎有個老闆成日揭我條裙，由嗰一刻開始我就唔中意著裙。

376
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:24,300
大家都有笑啊！嗬，係啊，我而家就畀你哋恥笑緊。咁呢個係咪公平公義咧？

377
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:33,370
我好明白，誒跨性別嘅人士有好多香港人嘅眼光，覺得係好怪。

378
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:52,960
我係最細，但係我成日畀人打，甚至乎我哥哥成日打我。我嗰一刻我都好討厭，我係一個女仔嘅身份。

379
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:43,230
誒，我曾經我自己由細到大都係一個唔公平嘅家庭長大，我屋企淨係石仔。

380
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:58,380
市民佢嘅身體狀態數據，佢哋唔一定係跨性別，亦都唔一定係雙性人，但係有呢啲數據嘅時候，可以幫助政府去定立更加多相關嘅政策、健康設施、保險等等。

381
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:23,480
人士、雙性人士、外國人同埋操唔同口音嘅人士，我哋社會都識得去尊重佢哋，亦都願意去了解多啲，同埋互相包容。我相信喺接觸到唔同嘅跨性別人士嘅時候，社會大眾都可以透過認識、瞭解，去達到互相包容同埋共融。

382
01:15:44,460 --> 01:16:04,470
女性身份生活嘅經驗，教識咗我平等機會嘅重要性。當我由細到大都被教導平等機會係唔會因為性別而受到影響嘅時候，到我發現自己係跨性別，然後認識咗更多其他嘅跨性別朋友之後，我卻發現佢哋係會因為佢哋嘅性別身份而喺揾工方面有困難、社交方面有困難，甚至有啲會因此而影響咗佢學習進修嘅機。

383
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:39,870
與其話性別同一個人嘅性器官有關，其實喺實際日日常生活上邊，一般人對其他人嘅性別嘅理解都只係根據外表。由我細細個入女廁嘅時候，我已經經常畀人當係男仔而產生尷尬。其實可能就算我肯除咗褲先，其他人都只會望到我上身先，然之後叫我快啲著翻條褲。就算我肯除咗條褲。

384
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:47,880
其實更加多嘅細節係需要喺第二部分去討論嘅。個人認為小組同埋政府係需要收集更加多嘅數據，例如同醫管局嘅醫療團隊、相關嘅醫生去了解更加多本地社羣嘅同埋更加update嘅情況，亦都可以誒透過譬如下一齣年去換身份證或者做人口普查嘅時候，收集更加多市民嘅性別認同嘅數據，或者係一性。

385
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,520
影響。

386
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,750
點解我哋成日都話？

387
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,530
我如果講錯咗佢嘅身份？

388
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,200
就係混亂咯，就係帶來社會嘅混亂。

389
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,480
係我女性嘅身份，我亦都結婚生仔。

390
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,220
我個女佢亦都有同志嘅朋友。

391
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:48,460
我哋係要用愛去愛佢哋，我哋唔係立一條法例。

392
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,940
加拿大、澳洲好多都立咗法啦，咁點啊？

393
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:07,950
稱呼咗係女性，佢有權話我歧視佢而控告我。

394
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:14,240
當然，我深信佢係一位好善良嘅人，佢唔會因為我嘅無知而控告我。

395
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:35,720
歧視歧視，到底定係你哋歧視緊我哋？唔理解你哋嘅心理狀態啊，定係我哋歧視緊你哋咧？

396
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:23,060
咁但係我唔擔保其他嘅人士唔會控告我，借問一聲，噉我嘅權利又去咗邊度咧？

397
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:58,130
去包容而強逼我覺得唔合理嘅思想加於我身上，當呢條法例立咗嘅時候。

398
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:33,280
借問一聲，好多國際大都市，好多嘅自由社會，英國、美國。

399
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:23,660
香港已經簽誒，我哋咧係屬於中國嘅一部分。你哋好多誒，好有呢一個誒法律啊專業人士啊，唔好意思啊，我稱呼得唔好專業人士嘅意見，有好多好多數據。

400
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:57,740
我真係好想問下大家，到底邊個歧視緊邊個？你哋成日話我哋歧視你哋，我從來都冇歧視你哋。我亦都教育我啲子女，我話佢哋由細到大嘅心路歷程到底係點樣，我哋唔知。我哋係唔應該要歧視任何一個人，佢哋所選擇嘅性別，佢哋所選擇嘅。

401
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,790
我亦都有得去交，冇問題㗎。

402
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,430
好多謝下下一位陳港文先生。

403
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,040
佢嘅心理狀態，佢覺得係噉，咪有得去交咯。多謝各位。

404
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:51,970
話畀大家聽，事實都唔係噉樣嘅。教會裏邊亦都係多元㗎，都唔係咁單一㗎。

405
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:24,350
只會增加細路哥喺性別認識上面嘅混亂，造成更多性別認同障礙嘅個案。好多謝你。最後一位就係卜沙倫女士。

406
01:24:52,260 --> 01:25:07,430
而且今日我哋都唔係因為人多大聲咧，就決定我哋嘅政策。政府咧亦都係實在需要關心社會裏邊被邊緣嘅人，站喺教會嘅立場，亦都應該關心最弱小嘅人。

407
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:12,990
幫助嘅權益，政府應該係推動同埋投放資源去防治同埋幫助患有性別認同障礙啲嘅人士，特別係幫助兒童、青少年及早發現問題同埋處理，而唔係立法將性別認同障礙去病化同埋正常化。

408
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:34,760
主席，我哋基於兒童健康成長嘅權益考慮，我哋反對香港設立性別承認制度，畀人咧可以喺法律上面去改變性別。終審法院W案嘅判決咧，其實係以世界衞生組織疾病同埋有關健康問題嘅國際統計分類咧，係將逆性別定義為性別認。

409
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:54,770
同障礙嘅一種嚟嘅。既然逆性症同埋性別認同障礙係心理疾病，我哋認為我哋去研究保障呢啲逆性症患者嘅方向，應該係去啊睇有關於醫療佢病症嘅法例，同埋我哋點樣可以使用行政手段咧，係讓佢嘅日。

410
01:21:54,770 --> 01:22:14,780
日常生活可以更加方便，而唔係去改變整個社會嘅性別承認法律同埋制度，強迫所有嘅人接受佢哋因為其心理疾病而自稱嘅性別。法律應該係反映社會共同接納嘅基本價值觀同埋正常合理嘅行為規範。若果我哋以法律去承認個人因為，

411
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:34,790
為性別認同障礙而選擇嘅性別，其實我哋係實質上將性別認同障礙呢個心理病咧係正常化、錯錯誤噉樣樣咧係將心理症狀引致嘅性別混亂當作權利，反而咧患者佢需要嘅心理輔導啊治療會被忽視，係一啲。

412
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:54,800
地方甚至被禁止注射荷爾蒙或者性別重置手術，亦會咧係由醫療手段變成純粹一種改變個人外觀上面嘅啊整容手段噉樣係被濫用，反而會侵害咗或者剝奪咗患者正確去認識佢本身病理嘅問題，同埋獲得適合醫療。

413
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:33,280
而且一旦法律上對性別認同從客觀嘅自然生理特徵，即係sex作為基礎改變，係以個人主觀感覺，即是gender去決定嘅時候咧，學校有關性別嘅教育內容亦必須係要去跟隨改變。噉樣嘅教育內容同自然生物學裏邊所教嘅。

414
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:53,290
嘅啊，性別定義係相衝突。美國兒科醫生學會嘅報告強調，心理性別（biological sex）咧係既定嘅生物學事實，而所謂嘅社會性別（gender）只不過係社會學同埋心理學上面嘅概念，唔可以取代生理性別。報告亦都提到。

415
01:23:53,290 --> 01:24:13,300
九十百分之九十八嘅男仔同啊百啊百分之八十八嘅女仔會隨住成長脱離咗性別焦慮症而接受自己嘅心理性別。因此，如果學校因為性別承認制度立法而教導學生跨性別主語所講性別係唔限男女，而係一貫性別嘅光譜，只

416
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:45,480
我今日咧係最後一個發言嘅，咁咧大家聽完就可以收工啊！希望咧大家都特別嘅醒神啊！咁咧我係誒基督眾樂教會嘅堂主任卜山雷牧師，彩虹之約嘅趙集仁，我哋係支持性別承認法嘅。過去咧大家考慮可能喺教會界裏邊咧都似乎係反對嘅聲音，但我要話。

417
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,570
嘅開始。

418
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,670
被歧視。

419
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,160
會想呃要回應啊，定係你想聽問題啊？

420
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:20,300
睇到佢哋嘅苦，佢哋被標籤。

421
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:39,330
佢嘅恩典咧，就係臨到嗰啲領受佢説話嘅人。

422
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:04,540
問題先啦，聽問題先係嘛？OK，好，咁第一位係誒黃碧雲議員，三分鐘。

423
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:16,740
喺眾樂教會裏邊咧，我哋會接觸到好多唔同跨性別嘅朋友，我哋有跨性別嘅小組，睇到佢哋嘅眼淚。

424
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:34,500
人人好唔好難明白佢哋，生命荊棘滿途，人生係跌跌撞撞嘅。有咗呢個性別成法嘅時候，我相信係幫助社會慢慢改變。

425
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:35,470
係上主所追尋，向佢哋施恩，係同佢哋同行，係可以經歷耶穌基督嘅大愛，可以活出一個整全嘅生命。我哋咧促請香港政府保護各類跨性別人士同埋雙性人嘅人權同埋尊嚴。

426
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:54,790
當然，教會誒社會唔係一下子就能夠完成改變，人心嘅改造係需要好漫長嘅過程。但係性別承認法，我相信係一個好嘅起點，係一個好嘅開始，就好似西方嘅誒黑奴解放運動啦，或者我哋中國啊誒前小腳嘅解放一樣，係一個好。

427
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:15,860
咁喺我哋誒嘅聲明裏邊咧，我哋有一個嘅故事嚇。喺聖經裏邊咧，《使徒行傳》八章廿七至到三十九節咧，主嘅使者咧誒挨近耶穌嘅門徒腓利去同佢講，去去同一個太監去碰面。呢一個係一個埃塞俄比亞嘅太監，呢個太

428
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:35,870
監最後咧接受咗耶穌，而且咧領受咗洗禮。我哋感謝耶穌，因為呢一個太監咧，雖然咧喺佢嘅誒耶路撒冷嘅敬拜生活裏邊咧，因為國籍嘅問題咧，佢分隔咗出嚟，但係我哋睇到耶穌就係努力咁去除咗將人分隔嘅標籤、分類。

429
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:59,620
可能你大家會話：誒呢個太監同今日嘅跨性別嘅人唔係好同啊。太監咧未必會視自己係個女人，但係無可否認咧，性小眾咧喺聖經裏邊咧誒冇提到佢哋出嚟，但係咪佢哋唔存在咧？唔係嘅，肯定佢哋都喺存喺嗰個社。

430
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:19,630
社會里邊，而耶穌透過肥利就係呢個相遇，肯定咗性少眾嘅生命價值喺今日嘅社會里邊啦。雙性人、跨性別人士都仍然係係被污名化，畀人叫太監啊、人妖啊、陰陽人。但係佢每一個都係上主所創造嘅，係上主所愛嘅。

431
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:55,760
希望建立一個共融嘅世界。Thank you，主席，Thank you，大家。好，誒咁而家我誒想邀請政府一方去扼要回應啦，因為我哋而家時間冇乜啦。噉我延長會議十五分鐘，每一位誒議員咧可以我諗三分鐘啦，好嘛？咁誒政府一方會唔會？

432
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:24,830
誒，主席就今日行出行入，因為有其他會議，不過我都有聽誒，聽到其實係對呢一個問題咧，個社會其實都係撕裂。即係，正如我哋處理誒同性戀嘅問題啊，或者你處理政改問題，其實我都係見到真係有唔同嘅睇法。

433
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,920
邊位想答？

434
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,430
咁誒？

435
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:04,130
啲性人係無關嘅。

436
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:42,070
fully analysing, consider all responses.

437
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:24,160
Well, I do agree that those are very important issues.

438
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:35,740
咁但係個問題咧就係誒，即係我哋而家知道咧，要處理咧就係講緊一啲所謂誒minority，即係小眾性小眾嘅問題。

439
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:38,700
and the weight to be given to the responses that we've received is definitely part of the process that will be looked at by the IWG when it comes to.

440
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:14,750
問下政府，你哋嗰個取向，當你要去保護小眾權益嘅時候，誒點樣去處理個所謂誒大眾啊嘅不同意見？誒究竟係邊個要讓路咧？噉我想聽聽政府嘅講法。係小組成員。

441
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:17,940
噉，我覺得即係佢哋嗰個嘅誒人權咧，係我哋需要正視嘅。但係要保護呢啲小眾嘅人權嘅時候，誒我都想問政府啦，究竟我哋係要睇大多數嘅人嘅意願啦，定還是係要聽小眾嘅意見咧？

442
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:58,360
我相信我哋唔係講緊要鼓勵啲人去變性啊，即係改變你原生嘅性別。但係就真係的確社會裏邊有一啲人咧，佢哋係有噉樣嘅誒意願。咁無論係天生或者係後天嘅因素啦，佢係誒想轉變佢嘅性別。

443
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:38,230
咁如果你話要聽嘅就係大多數人嘅意願喺今次嘅諮詢裏邊，你想睇下收到幾多封信噉樣樣，係支持政府做法或者反對政府做法。如果係由大多數決定少數人嘅權益嘅時候咧，就好恐怕咧，我哋永遠都保護唔到小眾，因為真係有可能係出現一

444
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:58,240
呢個所謂tyranny of majority，即係話大多數係可以施行暴政嘅。當佢個人嘅信念、價值觀等等啊，或者信仰嘅理解等等，佢會覺得不安啊。如果有人同佢唔同噉，所以咧就會係用主流價值咧，係凌駕啲小眾佢哋嗰個意願嘅。咁所以我都想問。

445
01:30:42,350 --> 01:31:02,360
O.K.咁嗱，即係其實頭先誒，我聽到啦，即係嗱，我自己申報啊，我係基督徒嚟嘅。咁但係我頭先係聽到好多基督徒咧，就誒，即係好咬牙切齒咁覺得，即係用一個互教學嘅approach去睇件事。噉我其實都係有啲擔心。誒，當然好開，好開心就聽到眾樂教會佢哋講到。

446
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:22,370
唔同嘅誒意見啦。噉，我覺得我哋嘅重點係要好尊重呢啲小眾，佢哋受到即係壓迫嘅嗰個處境，一定要係企穩喺一個保護小眾。佢哋都係人嚟嘅，無論佢同我哋幾唔同，同主流社會幾唔同都好咧，一定要保護佢哋嘅尊業同埋尊重佢哋嘅需要。

447
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:42,380
咯噉，我聽到有好多憂慮咧，係擔心，哎呀噉樣會唔會第日去廁所啊，喺更衣室嗰度蝕咗底啊，即係畀人誒及到我啊噉樣樣嗰個都唔知係男定女。但係其實如果係有啲憂慮嘅話，就應該講緊我哋公共嘅誒空間嘅嗰個設計裏邊點樣保障私隱。第二咧就係嗰啲非禮嘅法律同。

448
01:31:42,380 --> 01:32:02,390
買性騷擾嘅法律係咪健全，能夠保護到即係誒誒感覺不安嘅人士？噉，我覺得我哋其實係應該要喺嗰方面去做嘅，因為嗰個人會唔會非禮你，會唔會偷窺，其實係無論佢係同性戀或者異性戀或者係變性人都好，佢有噉嘅意圖咧，佢就會做嘅。所以同佢係咪變？

449
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,410
如果冇嘅話，周浩鼎如。

450
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:17,430
好，我哋呢個會開到八點半，有冇議員反對？

451
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:14,170
府佢下半世就係做呢樣嘢啦，你唔可以話你適應呢個身體啦，你你你即係好好咁去生活啦，噉樣多謝。

452
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:29,700
不過今日我聽到呢一場誒，大家其實嗰個對話嘅機會會大啲嘅誒，亦都聽到一啲跨性別朋友嘅分享，好難得。

453
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:20,150
呢個係一個好差嘅比喻。當然我冇權叫你道歉或者收翻，但我真係希望你唔好再講，或者其他人都唔好再講。嚇，你對佢哋嘅冒係冒犯，亦都係個傷害嚟。其實佢哋佢哋所受嘅痛苦已經好夠㗎啦。

454
01:33:49,990 --> 01:34:07,150
好好退讓屈就嘅，但係遠不過當我唔能夠代你哋去講啦。可能你哋覺得呢個重重要啲，但係調翻轉頭問啦，係咪如果佢哋肯屈就，唔會喺你面前除褲換衫，你就可以繼續傾落去咧？我又覺得未必啊。

455
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:58,830
立法嘅時候咧，始終咧無可避免咧，對嗰個社會嚟講咧，係一個比較大嘅牽動。即係今日有啲嘅議會者咧，就提到誒呢一件事咧，係影響係比較大，所以我相信咧喺社會上面嚟講咧，亦都有啲朋友會認為咧，係需要有多啲充分嘅討論。

456
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:24,610
啊，陳志全議員係誒，多謝主席。我諗咧，我可能係誒唯一一個坐足上下半場聽曬誒近六十個單位發言嘅議員。噉啊，今日有六十二個單位報名，噉啊出席率都好高，係接近六十個。上半場咧就三分二係反對誒性別承認。

457
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:44,620
機制三分一支持呢場咧就贊成嘅就少少多啲十七八個，反對就十一個。但係我就唔係想喺度同大家講數字。其實頭先啊Professor Kelly Looper講得好好，佢話保障小眾嘅權益，我哋唔係等到大多數人同意。

458
01:32:44,620 --> 01:33:04,630
意曬先至去做。如果要等到大多數人同意曬咧，噉就唔使做。因為在座對唔住，真係有啲朋友，我係我諗，我畀更多嘅時間，我都説服唔到你哋。不過，我想指出頭先有位與會者咧，就用強姦犯同埋殺人犯咧去類比跨性別人士，去類比有變成需要嘅人士，我覺得。

459
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:49,990
但係我就要問啦。譬如頭先啊，李碧然小姐噉，佢哋都同埋其他都有啦。佢哋花咗好多時間講洗手間同埋更衣室。難得咧，啊，馮綸文咧，佢就話：如果係咁咧，你肯咧，你限制我去洗手間同更衣室嘅權我都得嘅，即係唔畀我去公眾嘅，畀我去單丁。我覺得呢個已經係好。

460
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:27,480
即係呢個，只不過佢哋拎出嚟嘅一個反對理由。另一個好清晰，好多人都反對誒自我性別聲明呢個方法啦，即係反對派嘅人士。當然，我想指出，就算係自我性別聲明咧，都唔係話今日可以男，聽日係女，後日又變翻男噉樣嘅。但係我又要問啦，如果唔係自我性別聲明，其他？

461
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:47,490
嘅機制啊，包括誒進行一段時間嘅誒異性性別生活誒醫學嘅建議，即使唔係做曬手術或者一個委員會制度，你哋係咪又係有得傾咧？如果你話其實都唔係有得傾嘅，即係不過我講嗰個最離譜嗰個就出嚟反對嘅啫。即係最後我就希望誒。

462
01:34:47,490 --> 01:35:07,500
誒剩翻幾廿秒，我希望建議你睇一套電視劇。而家八點半做，叫做《跨世代》。其實呢套劇咧都有反映跨性別人士嘅心聲嘅，就係講歐陽震華一次意外嗰度咧，就同人交換咗個身體，佢進入咗另一個人嘅身體。噉佢下半生其實咧就要諗辦法去搞翻掂佢，佢就受個痛。

463
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:40,660
啊，多謝啊，主席。啊，我相信咧，誒，性小眾或者係跨性別人士嘅情況咧，係要關顧嘅。呢個我相信大家都明白。誒，因為今日我哋討論咧係性別是否要立呢個性別承認法。誒，我先要講一講咧，就係誒，因為如果係要進行一個

464
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:19,120
誒點至於點樣去照顧跨性別人士佢哋嘅情況咧？誒，我有個見解，我未必啱，但我即係攞出嚟大家傾下。如果誒，我哋用而家嘅行政措施，比如話舉個例，有啲誒朋友可能佢係好希望可以進行呢個變性嘅手術噉。

465
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:55,030
誒，我就其實好。

466
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,930
唔該，係主席。好，下一位，最後一位，張超洪議員。

467
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,610
咁而佢係亦都好堅定嘅決心去做呢個變性嘅手術。

468
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:24,120
咁如果佢經過一個醫學上面嘅診斷，認為佢身體可以做到嘅。

469
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:19,250
就會令到一啲人覺得呢一種人咧係一啲異類。

470
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:35,280
咁會唔會可能係調翻轉頭，就係政府可能係做一啲嘅支援，讓佢去做咗呢個手術。

471
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:19,240
我哋都諗辦法，有啲位畀佢哋可以去處理到佢哋嘅問題。噉我唔知噉樣係咪可以一個可行嘅方式咧？噉。

472
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:12,730
係認為佢哋係不道德，即係可能喺宗教上，或者我唔知咩原因咧。

473
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:51,500
嘅議題嚟講咧，應該係相對簡單嘅。不過，即係都冇嘢係簡單㗎啦，一牽涉到呢啲議題。

474
01:38:55,310 --> 01:39:04,830
難過咧，即係覺得有好多團體或者個人咧，就將一啲唔同性傾向或者係跨性別嘅人士。

475
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:32,000
話即係可能其實對於佢哋要承認佢哋原來嗰個性別，可能真係好睏難。但會唔會如果有一啲嘅支援，畀一啲嘅心理輔導佢哋，或者佢畀佢去試下去接受翻自己原來嗰個嘅性別，又會唔會係一樣可行嘅方式咧？

476
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:55,570
當佢完順利咁完成咗呢個手術咧，其實佢就已經變咗嗰個，即係個性別可以變咗，噉啊可以承認咗佢呢個變嘅性誒嘅性別嘅。咁喺呢一種嘅行政措施嘅方面，係咪可以協助到佢哋咧？如果我哋有呢啲嘅行政措施，又係咪可以至少都解決到啊？

477
01:36:55,570 --> 01:37:15,580
一啲部分或者相當部分嘅情況同埋問題咧，第二樣嘢亦都可能，或者我提一個見解出嚟，就係話，如果喺性別承認有障礙嘅朋友，係咪調翻轉頭，我哋可以諗就係有冇一啲嘅心理嘅輔導可以幫助佢？嗱，雖然我明白今日我聽到好用心聽咗好多與會者話。

478
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:52,290
其實都係讓佢可以諗辦法去解決佢而家嗰個痛苦。咁如果我哋呢啲嘢都能夠做到嘅，噉係咪可以我哋先做呢啲嘅嘢，而未必而家我哋即刻就要去做一個性別承認法嘅立法咧？因為畢竟呢個性別承認法嘅立法咧的而且確亦都係可能對個社會整。

479
01:37:52,290 --> 01:38:12,300
個倫理嘅價值啊等等，都會有一個比較大嘅改動。噉我覺得可能社會上咧都真係的確可能需要多啲嘅討論同時間嘅。但我就希望可唔可以提供一啲方式翻出嚟，可以又可以照顧到跨性別人士嘅一啲嘅情況，可以照顧到佢哋，可能佢哋而家係誒承受緊呢個痛苦，但係我。

480
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:43,290
係，多謝主席，亦都多謝咁多團體上嚟啦。誒，呢一個性別承認，本來咧，我覺得係一個相對容易處理嘅一個，即係喺誒不同性傾向啊，誒，即係整個LGBT嘅。

481
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:20,010
佢即係仍然喺度諮詢緊，應唔應該做咧？

482
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:08,280
咧都有咩意見咧，都盡量喺十一月十二月尾之前咧就寫入嚟啦。噉就。

483
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:55,840
有人提出一啲嘅憂慮，若果係有啲方法係去針對處理咧，我哋都會特別去分析嘅。

484
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:37,540
咁但係終審法院喺W誒女士案已經講得好清楚。

485
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:29,680
亦都係不道德，誒不能夠接受，以致到佢唔可以享有任何嘅法律嘅權利。

486
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:32,200
多年嘅啦，即係話基本上咧，如果對於一個誒，即係所謂依家係有一個性別焦慮或者性別不安嘅人士咧，其實醫管局咧都已經有呢個嘅服務係可以誒，當佢哋會去做。

487
01:39:57,890 --> 01:40:15,620
所面對嘅困難噉，而我哋嘅工作小組咧，佢嘅工作範疇亦都係即係睇翻要全面保障呢啲變性人士嘅法律權利，同埋所有需要嘅法例同相關行政措施作出合適嘅改革啊！嘛。

488
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:57,890
就係呢件事係誒呢位W人士係有權去同一位異性結婚，而亦都落咗個命令咧，就話要誒政府係即係盡快去妥善咁解決變性人士所有法律範疇。

489
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:35,910
咁誒，我睇唔到點樣樣，只可以睇行政措施。我覺得重點係個法例嘅改革。噉我其實好覺即係誒心急。我覺得呢件事法院已經喺二零一三年下咗命令。

490
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:55,920
咁但係而家二零一七咧，我哋仲係喺一個諮詢嘅階段，甚至我自己覺得咧，誒，你諮詢嘅方向都有啲問題。你第一個竟然係問應唔應該有個法院都落咗命令係要有，噉你仲問大家應唔應該有？噉我明白呢個係有爭議性。

491
01:40:56,110 --> 01:41:16,120
但係你係咪應該儘快盡跟住法院嗰個方向落個命令嘅方向，就係你建議出一啲嘅具體嘅法例嘅改革同埋行政措施，可能有幾個方案，然後去誒諮詢公眾，而唔係喺呢度再。

492
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:41,470
你想唔想佢嚟答啊？好啊！誒，或者最後時間咧，我畀誒工作小組嘅成員啊綜合回應，或者再答一答張小紅議員嘅一個誒，或者我都嘗試誒綜合嘅小回應咧。噉就首先都多謝委員會就安排今日呢個嘅聽證會啦。咁其實都係。

493
01:41:41,470 --> 01:42:01,480
係可以讓我哋有機會咧，可以聽到即係咁多團體同個人咧，係嗰啲意見咧，其實會係有效幫助到我哋下一步咧，係去處理，即係我哋跟住點樣去做。咁當我哋諮詢期係未完嘅，我哋會到十十二月尾，咁亦都呼籲咧，就係公眾其他人士。

494
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:28,570
誒當然我哋係好明白得到咧。誒今次個議係嗰個複雜性，咁亦都喺無論喺今日嘅會議或者之前，我哋嘅其他我哋有做嘅一啲諮詢嗰度咧，都睇得到咧個爭議性係高嘅。咁當然小組我相信我哋會希望咧。

495
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:48,580
我哋即係最終，我哋會係好小心睇睇啲意見之後咧，我哋可以好有理有據噉樣分析翻即係嗰個情況。亦都當中，如果發覺係有啲嘅意見，可能係基於一啲嘅誤解嘅時候，當然我哋亦都會希望可以係去特別去處理啊，或者當中。

496
01:42:56,120 --> 01:43:16,130
咁有誒有一兩點具體回應啦，聽咗之後，噉就話周浩鼎議員咧就有問到有兩個嘅考慮方案咧。噉我諗喺諮詢文件其實我哋都有一定程度交代過嘅，譬如周議員提到咧，即係佢心目中嗰種嘅行政措施咧，其實現時咧已經做咗好。

497
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,950
噉就至於誒啊！

498
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:53,320
咧，其實你係需要係去幫佢哋係去改變佢哋嗰個身體，咁呢個都係我哋有嘅資料啦。

499
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:14,070
咧噉就第一嚟講，身份證係換咗，但法律嘅地位係冇改變到嘅。咁亦都因為行政措施咧。

500
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:44,790
嗰嗰班如果係願意做一個正別重建手術嗰啲咧，經過評估、經過一啲嘅即係生活體驗之後咧，佢已經有做，咁亦都醫管局暫時安排咧，亦都係如果完全。

501
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:45,290
係會跟嗰個身份證去行事，咁再加上如果係非官方機構咧，咁更加佢冇一個嘅法律責任或者義務咧，係需要跟你嘅身份證嗰個處理。咁呢個都係諮詢文件特別提及過咧。如果係

502
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:30,370
就算身份證係轉咗性別咧，唔係表示其他政府部門咧需要跟呢個新嘅身份證嘅性別係去行事。咁其實W K亦都喺個例子啦，即係當時即係喺起碼喺處理婚姻嗰度咧，個部門就佢唔會覺得。

503
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:36,460
係咪得曬咧？係咁咧，就啊，首先好多謝咁多嘅代表同埋團體咧，就啊一直係去到今晚嘅八點半啦。亦都好多謝工作小組嘅代表咧，係啊分別去解答咗我哋第一節同埋第二節嘅意見啦。

504
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:15,330
個判詞咧，就政府就最後成立咗我哋呢個嘅跨部門小組去做研究咯。咁呢個係少少資料上嘅澄清，因為我哋仲係諮詢期間咧，就我哋暫時我哋唔會話即係表達一個立場。噉我亦都冇噉嘅資格代表小組咧，係表達任何立場，係應該行邊個方向咯？

505
01:43:45,070 --> 01:44:05,080
完成咗性別重置手術嘅人咧，可以畀到佢一張新嘅身份證咧。咁呢個已經係做咗好多年嘅，已經係噉。當然諮詢文件有提及到咧，如果單單行政措施咧，可能有啲問題係冇處理得到嘅啊。咁喺諮詢文件係特別提到咧，即係依家呢個行政措施嘅安排。

506
01:44:45,570 --> 01:45:05,580
現行呢個行政措施咧係有啲問題係冇處理到嘅，噉就想少少回應。噉啊，至於啊，周議員提到話，即係誒心理輔導啊方面咧，噉我哋相關資料文件裡面，我哋即係睇嗰啲嘅資料咧，其實咁耐以嚟心理輔導啊，或者精神輔導咧，已

507
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:25,590
咁多年已經係一一路係會進行緊嘅，所以先至會有即係呢個G.I.D啊，其他方面即係嗰啲嘅呢個評估啊。咁但係當然喺我哋睇到嘅資料咧，都顯示到似乎咧係有當中有一批人咧，起碼數量幾多或者係類型係點樣唔知啦，就話。

508
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:45,600
似乎係心理輔導咧，本身係解決唔到佢哋問題。咁咧，亦都係喺中審法院嘅判判詞裏面咧，都特別係引用到有關嘅一啲嘅即係所謂醫學嘅嘅嘅證據咧，就表示咧有啲人即係唯一幫佢解決到佢嘅困境嘅。

509
01:45:56,230 --> 01:46:16,240
張超雄議員提及到咧，即係話誒，我哋係咪冇遵守中審法院嘅命令咧？咁都有少少澄清翻咧，就係誒，中審法院佢處理嗰個個案咧，就喺法律上佢淨係處理嗰個婚姻權嘅問題，咁而喺嗰度咧，中審法院嘅命。

510
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:36,250
令咧，基本上喺佢頒布之後一年之後咧，雖然立法通過唔到任何修訂咧，但係已經係生效咗。所以中等法院嘅命令咧，本身已經係即係執行咗㗎啦。咁嗱，終審法院咧就並冇任何命令咧，就話一定要香港實行或者唔實行一個。

511
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:56,260
嘅性別承認法律嘅，當然佢喺個判詞裡面有提及過咧。政府需要去誒特別可能會參考埋英國誒二零零四年嗰個嘅性別承認法咧，去睇下會唔會制定一個就性別承認嗰方面嘅法律。咁呢個就唔係中央嘅命令啦。咁亦都係因為呢。

512
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,370
漁案啦，就係係唔係話要立法咧？

513
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:32,260
誒嗰個法庭只係話叫我哋去參考下去研究。

514
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:34,420
對，咁變咗，我覺得就唔好咁衝，即係咁咁誒。

515
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,940
誒會向小組係正式係誒交交畀佢哋嘅，多謝大家，多謝。

516
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:03,870
誒頭先第一節同埋第二節，你會睇到社會喺呢一方面咧，的確出現好大嘅分歧。

517
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:28,890
而家去討論，會唔會係唔係透過立法？因為立法你一立死咗咧，就係好多樣嘢咧，就係誒你冇冇得轉彎嘅時候咧，一係佢就會好激烈嘅反應。大家都知道喺呢一個問題上冇分政見嘅。

518
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:56,750
咁咧，作為即係誒，我哋本委員會咧嘅即係誒今日呢一節嘅誒討論咧，就係喺嗰個諮詢期係誒即係去延長嘅時候咧，就應該咧，我哋嘅意見亦都係唔會受影響嘅。但係即係我亦都係誒，透過呢個機會咧，我自己亦都係表達一下我嘅意見。

519
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:24,160
而誒，我亦都真係收到好多嘅憂慮。其實你睇到咧，就今日其實上邊都有啲係啊拖住好多小朋友嚟嘅家長嗰啲人咧，佢並唔係咁政治性嘅。睇到佢係有一個好實質嘅憂慮咧，即係誒，我認為呢個議題首先特別。

520
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:52,550
喺外國立咗法唔等於香港咧，一定要跟，即係嗰個情況點樣去處理？話而家係有一啲誒少部分人佢有一個需要嗰個問題咧，誒，我覺得喺社會咧仲係即係仲要有充分嘅討論。我認為呢一樣嘢，如果我哋好急促噉樣。

521
01:48:52,550 --> 01:49:12,560
走去立法嘅方向，可能係另外一個社會嘅炸彈，嗰個咧都係一個好大嘅撕裂。即係我覺得，即係嗰個撕裂嘅情況唔會少得過任何現時喺誒我哋過去見過嘅一啲情況，可能會更加激烈添。所以，我認為咧都係要需要更多嘅即係大。

522
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:49,180
唔係政治立場嘅問題嚟嘅，你睇到咧，即係唔同政治立場嘅，可能佢就喺呢個問題上係有分歧嘅。咁所以我我諗誒，我其實都要同工作小組講，即係我覺得係要好小心處理。雖然頭先嗰個回應，尤其是張達明誒誒教授佢。

523
01:49:49,180 --> 01:50:09,190
係話到誒，似乎有啲嘢你就咁用私手術啊，嗰啲係未必係解決到。但係我始終有啲嘢，你係未必真喺社會度呢啲牽涉到道德價值觀嘅嘢，你係可能真係係要用一啲誒其他社會嘅方法，大家有更多嘅溝通同埋減少嗰。

524
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:29,200
嗰種對立，而即係唔係話咧係用立法係可以解決到嘅問題嚟嘅。我自己會睇到你喺走立法嘅方向嘅話咧，嗰個社會嘅嗰個衝突就隨之而起。誒，你睇到即係嗰個反應，我自己都見到咧，就誒好多我未見過嘅團體去係出嚟反。

525
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:55,470
咁衝動一下子咧，就係話講到立法。第二咧就係誒嗰個判決，其實亦都係冇提到我哋要立法。我哋係研究噉佢政府做咗個諮詢報告出嚟咧，交咗，終於抽交咗出嚟。噉我哋咧可以繼續再要傾呢個問題啊。但係我亦都覺得即係要慎重咯。討論到提出立法嘅問題。

526
01:50:55,470 --> 01:51:15,480
喺社會上必須要慎重，因為佢係牽涉廣大個市民嗰個嗰個誒成個反映呢個社會嘅道德價值。噉我諗咧就誒今日仍然係好多謝大家，好多謝大家出席我哋嘅誒聽證會。我哋都會將今日嗰個大家表達嘅意見咧係整理咗係。
