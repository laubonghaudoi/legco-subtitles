或E.U. eyed。

19
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,020
since January this year.

20
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,960
政府已做多。

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,520
of their customers, with the views.

22
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,400
好，good morning, Miss the Chairman and members of the Bills Committee.

23
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,620
要於2018年5月進行首次報告，並於2018年5月之後持續進行。

24
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,390
銀行工會嘅袁漢章先生，唔該曬你啊，袁生。

25
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,920
for instance， banks are conducting due diligence to identify residents for tax purposes.

26
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,030
We thank you for the invitation to give our view on the Inland Revenue Amendment Number Three Bill 2017.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,110
代表香港銀行協會，並擔任主席的共同報告階段工作組反逃税委員會。

28
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,740
Our member banks have implemented requirements of the current legislation on automatic exchange of financial account information.

29
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,030
This was a result of significant human, financial and system resource investments that banks have made in the last few years.

30
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:57,170
各項嘅保安措施，嗱呢一份嘅須知已經夾附喺秘書處發給各位嘅函件中，亦都係啊放咗喺啊各位嘅枱面上邊嘅。

31
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:38,230
香港是個重要國際金融中心，和其能力去履行其AEOI承諾，被國際社會，例如AOECD和EU，所認可，是維持此地位的關鍵。

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:16,660
嗱，如果你哋誒各位團隊係準備咗啲發言稿或者信件嘅時候咧，請誒稍後發言完之後咧，係喺離開會議室之前咧，啊交給我哋嘅職員。好啦，噉我哋誒首先咧就請香港。

33
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,770
excuse me, financial institutions alike.

34
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,140
With our current and prospective trading partners.

35
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,760
to further enhance Hong Kong's economic growth potential.

36
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,860
business businesses and operations within the banks.

37
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,630
and would lend our general support to the proposal.

38
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,690
for these reasons, we recognise the drivers of the bill.

39
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,710
such as the posters APIs, taxpayer benefits.

40
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,950
guidance for financial institutions etc. upon passage of the bill.

41
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,840
We have included specific definitional matters in our submission.

42
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,740
這些努力， have been strenuous， as the implementation practically touched on all of its

43
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,800
to reflect the practical changes and impacts, the government should take steps to update its official information sources.

44
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,770
aside from adding 72 reportable jurisdictions, the proposal includes specific one-off requirements.

45
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:51,150
要 pursuе the new international tax agenda in the areas of information exchange, tax transparency and the fight against tax evasion.

46
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:12,770
Considering the timing of the bill, it is crucial to disseminate up-to-date and consistent messages to the public and information institutions alike.

47
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:13,930
作為我早前所指，我們的成員已盡力達成必要的合規，以符合現行的《歐盟反洗錢條例》。

48
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:52,960
我們也相信政府會在一個位置採取必要的步驟和措施，來加速香港的綜合雙重税收協定網絡的擴展。

49
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,290
Their existing policies and procedures.

50
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,060
We would therefore like to take the opportunity today.

51
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,560
to share some of the challenges for the committee's consideration.

52
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,810
ones should not underestimate the efforts and complexity involved.

53
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,680
在delivery of additional compliance requirements in a short time.

54
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,790
在最近的會議中，與FSTB和IRD、HCap。

55
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,730
processes and control systems, governance, training and communication materials for the staff and the customers alike.

56
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,590
Under the circumstances, our members will need to further inject significant resources to review and update.

57
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,330
to collect and furnish account information for the second half of 2017, within a very short space of time.

58
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:17,220
And only provide data to theIRD for those jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has signed an AUI agreement.

59
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:26,200
similarly， the government could consider allowing banks as an option， to submit data for the full year of 2017.

60
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:26,350
And Pwma，that is private wealth management association，highlighted concerns raised by the industry and pre and presented suggestions。

61
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:08,970
It is not difficult to realise that it is tantamount to another mini AEOI implementation that needs to be completed within months.

62
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:36,140
While we understand that adopting some of our suggestions may not be immediately feasible at this point, we wish to nevertheless stress that.

63
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:37,700
for the 72 new jurisdictions, in order to do away with extensive changes that will be necessary to handle a one-off item to report on six-month basis.

64
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:08,910
to help manage the burden on the first reporting, we suggested that banks could be made responsible for holding the relevant data for all 72 newly added reportable jurisdictions.

65
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,310
That said.

66
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,850
under the current legislation.

67
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,830
多謝你，多謝你，顧問。

68
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,650
banks are required to follow the so-called

69
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,720
targeted approach to the due diligence requirements.

70
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,100
會incur significantly higher efforts and investment.

71
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,150
你已經已經聽過洪俊先生來自香港銀行業協會。

72
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,880
It should not come as a surprise that banks adopting this narrow approach.

73
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,960
which sometimes involves specific interests and concerns distinct from those other banking institutions.

74
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,240
wealth management businesses providing personalised banking and portfolio management services.

75
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,490
在完成盡職調查，for pre-existing customers，within the remaining months of 2017。

76
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:46,250
In this case, PWMa and HKAB share a number of the same concerns about the implementation of the proposed legislation.

77
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:17,670
Specifically, the high the number of high-value accounts will surge due to the inclusion of 72 new jurisdictions, as opposed to Japan and the UK only.

78
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:28,900
And I wish to explain that Pwma members are mostly also members of the HKAB. We represent the interests of these firms in their capacity as private wealth management institutions.

79
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:39,350
In closing, the chairmen and members of the bills committee will undoubtedly be able to ascertain that banks should ideally be allowed more time in which to implement the proposal。好，唔該曬呢，袁生。呃，next we'll have Mr. Peter Stein。呃，Mr. Stein， you have six minutes。Thank you。

80
00:09:43,140 --> 00:10:03,150
我 wish to also thank the Legislative Council for giving us this opportunity to share with you our views. Some quick background about our organisation: the PWMA comprises 47 member firms, all of whom are authorised institutions and licensed corporations in Hong Kong, with dedicated private.

81
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,870
and this will make it.

82
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,140
The FIS requirements.

83
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,410
在時機適宜的時刻，於法案通過之後。

84
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,050
crucial for the government to update its official information sources.

85
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,980
That said， it is important to note that the proposed changes will result in a very tight timeline for all parties.

86
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:54,330
which includes posters, API taxpayer pamphlets， and especially guidance for financial institutions.

87
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:43,220
While many PWMa member firms have adopted the wide approach, those that have adopted the targeted approach will be highly disadvantaged in meeting that new demand.

88
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:59,360
We do very much understand the drivers of this bill. We need, we understand the need to implement the amendments to the existing legislation in a timely manner.

89
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:09,540
It's important for the IRD guidance for financial institutions to clarify, with respect to the additional 72 reportable jurisdictions.

90
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:57,010
基本上，金融機構將需要籌集大量的資源，人和財務，以實施本建議在二零一七年下半。

91
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:31,850
所以，我 wish to state up front and for the record that PWMA is generally supportive of the government's efforts and the proposed expansion of the list of reportable jurisdictions.

92
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:11,670
他們將被要求完成一份全面的審查，對在他們機構持有的帳户，以識別那些可能由74個可報告的司法管轄區的税居民持有的帳户，與之前相比。

93
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:45,710
While PWMA generally supports the proposal to expand the number of reportable jurisdictions, we believe it is important for all of our stakeholders to understand the key challenges that our members will face in complying with the new law.

94
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:28,300
and that they are required to complete due diligence for new accounts if not performed already to identify reportable accounts, to complete the review of high value added accounts before the end of two thousand seventeen, and to furnish six month financial account data.

95
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:18,600
And we fully appreciate that the global expectations around taxation and information exchange are evolving quickly, and that the SAR government should be doing its part to ensure that Hong Kong is able to meet these expectations to the standard that is commensurate with its status as a reputable global financial centre.

96
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,000
誒。

97
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,450
and.

98
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,560
嗯。

99
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,900
to whom we made the following suggestions.

100
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,980
首先好多謝誒，Mr. Chairman就誒。

101
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:17,100
在六個月，與 respect to the 72 新ly added reportable jurisdictions， as opposed to Japan and the UK。

102
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,340
Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Stein. And跟住咧，下下一位係香港會計師公會譚振雄先生。阿譚生唔該你。

103
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,210
那會 lessen the heavy burden of the need to manage and submit six-month data on a one-off basis, as opposed to the usual full-year reporting thereafter.

104
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:55,520
這些 concerns were previously shared in a meeting that we and HKAB held with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and IRD on 24 April.

105
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:29,330
那建議是做，出以減低提供大量一次性六個月資料，與如此多司法管轄區同時進行的運作風險。

106
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:42,200
我們也建議政府考慮允許金融機構作為一個選項，提交2017年全年的數據，為所有72個新增可報告的管轄區。

107
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:06,310
We noted that FIs that adopt the required targeted approach will be strained in completing pre-existing customer due diligence for a much larger pool of high-value accounts.

108
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:46,160
While we recognise the rapid pace at which the new AEUI provisions have to be legislated, we urge the government to recognise that banks will have made their best efforts to implement the requisite changes within a very short time frame.

109
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:31,380
This is particularly the case for any Pwma member institutions that adopt the targeted approach, since the customer due diligence for pre-existing high-value accounts will require more time and resources than for ordinary retail banking clients.

110
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:17,600
我們建議，作為Mr. Hahn所指出的，讓金融機構負責持有相關資料，為所有管轄區，並僅提供資料給IRD，為與香港簽署雙邊主管權協議的管轄區。

111
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:32,500
for so-called pre-existing high-value accounts for individuals that includes those who have 7.8 million Hong Kong dollars or more in their accounts, which is essentially all of the private banking clients of PwM member firms. That review will require more time and resources than for ordinary retail banking clients.

112
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:20,470
我就我哋嘅會計師公會，其實in general係support呢個呢個誒propose legislation change嘅。咁最主要嚟講咧，就係誒我哋亦都覺得誒香港要be have to be in line with the international standard，誒which the A U I exchange of information being one of them。

113
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,750
文雅圖，我睇下。

114
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,310
同同佢哋嘅commercial transaction係唔多嘅。

115
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,860
噉啊，第三點就係誒誒。

116
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,290
誒，但係但係，bank會think that I may have。

117
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,170
On the self-declaration, I know that I'm not a resident of certain countries, for example.

118
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,800
how to how to beat that objective of having a

119
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,920
我哋第一真係未必同佢哋有個treat嘅個個個個趨勢好small嘅好little嘅。

120
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:17,560
After all the due diligence, okay, I think I think the the still really hinges on the definition of residence, okay, and.

121
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:16,530
to the list，OK，誒，例如佢舉個例先咧，好似誒，我哋見到個Lebanon，OK，誒，Kuwait，OK，誒。

122
00:18:48,210 --> 00:19:03,580
AEOI of reporting jurisdiction with those that we have tax treaty with, or union members or whoever show the interest that they want to have AEOI with with Hong Kong. I think that's we have to make a distinction here.

123
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:42,520
亦都satisfy嗰個所謂privacy嗰個樣嘢，噉我哋先會同佢簽AUI嘅。噉我我就睇睇嗰四十、七十四個country咧，係有啲country，第一我哋。

124
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:40,480
誒，我哋唯一我哋嘅審批上嘅actually yes，我哋send咗畀畀誒誒誒誒呢個Bill’s Committee嘅。噉就我哋唯一比較比較誒有一兩個concern就可能係提出嚟嘅咧，就係話誒嗰個reporting jurisdictions，I think that's only the first step。OK， and as I understand

125
00:16:40,480 --> 00:17:00,490
then it you would have to have the EUI arrangement with the EU members before the end of the year okay before the end of 2017 now I think we should have a more concrete timetable by the FSB on how

126
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:26,090
E.U. arrangement with all the E.U. countries by the end of the year。OK， and then the the the第二個 concern，第二個 concern就係嗰個七十四個countries咧啊。我哋我哋冇記錯，睇翻啊啊F.S.T.B.出嚟嗰個proposal都講話，我哋會知道對方係會。

127
00:17:46,590 --> 00:18:06,600
誒第二個就係我哋亦都有有少少resolution，佢哋會唔會係fulfill到我哋説嘅要求咧？咁換句話嚟講，個likelihood getting AUI arrangement in these countries probably would be remote。OK，如果係remote嘅時候，then why put that into there？

128
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,480
所以信息就畀sent。

129
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,950
Okay， what has been sent？

130
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,070
those are the three main items that.

131
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,030
what you know my knowledge on what information has been sent.

132
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,910
啊！我哋覺得可能政府應該可能係考慮一下嘅啫。

133
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,070
淑儀女士，阿李小姐，你有誒六分鐘嘅時間，唔該。

134
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,130
through the I/O D to the other jurisdiction, without.

135
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:48,730
OK，啊噉我噉我覺得咧有個需要咧就係話誒嗰個individual concern to know。

136
00:19:51,230 --> 00:20:03,430
咁喺呢啲咧，我哋亦都可能，如果係啊，老師都有issue coming from底下咧，justin to to take me as an example，噉我我我有要prepare for it。

137
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:12,730
誒誒，你係咪用翻啊歐文用嗰套咧，或者Fyca嗰套咧？噉我覺得誒，將好多匯報嘅責任咧，畀咗落去依個財務機構度啊。噉我覺得税務局或者甚至乎相關嘅金誒監管機構，譬如金誒。

138
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:48,210
OK，咁點解需要係有個噉嘅誒Putting and Reporting Instructions咧？咁咁呢個係一個我哋提提出嚟噉，可能係誒Government可能SAR應該可以研究下誒explain係點解OK？Another just a general approach saying that we want to have。

139
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:32,270
係誒，唔該曬阿譚生。不過譚生，我我即係誒提一提你咧，喺誒立法會嘅聽證會度誒誒發表意見咧，最好就一係就用廣東話完全程廣東話，一係就全程英文或者普通話，因為噉樣係方便咗我哋嗰個翻譯嘅同事。唔該曬各位嘅誒朋友。另外仲有阿李。

140
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:56,360
誒各位，我好贊成咧呢個修訂嘅，但係咧，我觀乎過去嗰幾年咧，業界有好多修訂咧，政府去畀嗰個誒相關配套設施設施啊，或者即係to what extent，即係或者你你你去到咩程度，我哋要去匯報呢個誒資料咧？你係咪用翻？

141
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:33,020
金管局啊，佢哋應該要有更多更多嘅指引，係講明係點樣做法。譬如你參考人哋新加坡咧，好多銀行咧，佢哋有個policy咧叫anti fishing啊，反釣魚啊。咩叫做反釣魚咧？就即係話誒，你你唔學你要資料咩？你你每個國家政府你對某一個你嘅公民起

142
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:53,030
我我哋嘅範圍入邊嘅財務資料，你有興趣知道嘅，你要好specific、好仔細、好特定噉話畀我聽，係幾時幾月幾日係講緊咩金額。如果你講到嘅，我喺嗰個金融機構度揾到出嚟係嘅，噉我就會提供我啲資料啦。你唔可以就咁畀一個人，我懷疑佢係乜嘢。

143
00:21:53,030 --> 00:22:13,040
噉我就要畀曬啲資料你，因為我相信大家都贊成喺一個誒透過去立例去打擊一啲跨境嘅逃税行動，大家都係贊成嘅。呢個原則上係冇問題嘅，但係喺嗰個誒措施執執頻上咧，我哋要諗下我哋能我哋畀到業界嘅壓力，譬如誒。

144
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,030
唔該。好，唔該曬，阿李女士。

145
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,240
誒幫助業界嘅前線把守呢個誒，即係。

146
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:28,590
嗯，政府就各議會團體嘅發言有冇一啲初步嘅回應啊？唔該，啊，阿黎生唔該你。

147
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:26,760
都留意到，頭先主報者提出咗一啲即係建議或者係疑問，我亦都希望即係稍後嚟講就呢一啲做出一個初步嘅回應嘅。

148
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:20,880
於佢哋嗰個資源嘅投入，同埋係要誒放多啲誒工作落去去處理我哋呢一個法例上嘅要求，我哋係誒深切表示理解嘅，亦都希望大家明白，其實今次呢一個。

149
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:57,280
李小姐、李李女士所所講就話：究竟我哋要求啲資料係咪過多定過少咧？噉樣其實我哋都係依翻即係經合組織嗰個統一規格，係佢要我哋係交啲咩資料嘅話咧，我哋就要希望翻嗰個財務機構、金融機構收集翻嗰相關資料嘅啫。

150
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:45,260
有需要去作出一個適當嘅回應嘅。咁首先，我喺度對於即係各嗰個幾個主要團體嘅支持嚟講，我哋係表示係感謝嘅。另一方面，我哋亦都好明白誒呢一啲誒新嘅誒誒要求，對於

151
00:23:49,050 --> 00:24:07,510
三月開始嘅時候，都已經係同唔同嘅團體進行一啲會面同埋簡介會，等佢哋明白我哋今次改動嗰個目標同埋嗰個誒重點喺邊一度。咁首先我喺度好多謝頭先誒發言嘅幾個團體，包括係誒銀行公會啦、誒私人。

152
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:33,050
銀行界佢哋嘅壓力係乜嘢咧？係咪純粹教佢哋前線操作員去去去決定邊啲資料畀邊啲資料唔畀咧？或者有冇啲guidelines我哋係應該喺咩情況之下，我哋係要誒披露披露幾多？同埋即係呢度要我覺得係要畀多啲誒配套嘅設施咯。咁同埋亦都要誒，即係考慮到。

153
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:53,060
嗰個客户嗰個私隱嘅問題咯，就唔可以人哋畀個名你，我就所有資料畀曬你。咁噉，我我我見唔到呢方面有好多好詳細嘅嘅資料睇到出嚟咯。可能或者你哋可以補充下咯。噉我主要發現係針對呢個誒反釣魚同埋呢個誒點樣去誒。

154
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:17,530
把把把，即係點樣把關呢個風險？嗰道理係畀多更多指引咯，同埋誒某程度太嚴嘅亦都影響到業界嗰個發展啦。太緊嘅誒太嚴影響業界發展啦，太鬆嘅亦都影響到客户利益、私隱問題。咁希望誒你哋都去留意下咯。噉我發現係咁多。

155
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:49,050
誒唔該，主席誒誒，早晨，委員誒，亦都好多謝今日出席呢個即係聽證會嘅四位代表啦。咁其實誒，我哋誒政府喺允讓呢一個修訂税務條例去配合呢一個自動税務資料交換計劃呢一個改例工作嘅時候，我哋喺三。

156
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:28,190
財富管理公會啦，同埋係誒誒會計師公會嘅同事都整體上係對於我哋呢一個今次嘅修例係表示支持，亦都理解到就係其實誒近年間國際間嗰個税務合作同埋税務要求，的確改變得好快。咁所以香港作為一個金融中國際金融中心係。

157
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:31,820
咁但係，如果我哋今次係要將七十五個誒嘅國家地區，即係其中七十三個新啊嚇。

158
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:43,580
係列入呢一個需申報地區名單入邊嘅話咧，我哋都覺得係應該係將呢一個主要信息係提更畀啲市民同埋係啲客户參考嘅。咁呢個宣傳工作我哋係會跟進嘅。

159
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:37,190
嘅誒嗰個出發點就希望時間誒喺嘅財務機構方面多啲時間去去整理整合呢啲嘅資料，但係我亦都希望議員同埋誒與會者能夠明白咧，嗯。

160
00:26:47,110 --> 00:27:04,220
嘅誒一啲建議，譬如話我哋誒税務局而家已經準備緊，如果呢個係誒修訂法例係獲得立法會通過嘅話咧，我哋係會更新我哋畀財務機構嘅一啲執行指引，等佢哋知道根據新嘅安排嚟講係應該係點樣做法嘅。

161
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:34,910
第一時間係完整地交畀税務局，喺税務局係有一個好穩健、好即係安全嘅系統去保管處理嘅話咧，呢一個對於我哋同日後嗰啲地區國家去進行一個有效嗰個交收工作、資料交收工作係會有幫助嘅。

162
00:24:45,540 --> 00:25:05,550
金融機構、銀行或者財務機構嚟講，一定係有一啲額外嘅循規嘅負擔係製造咗嘅。噉佢哋喺人手上啊、資訊系統啊，或者係喺誒客户聯絡嗰方面，都一定係加重咗佢哋嗰個工作嘅要求，以達至到呢一方面嗰個目標嘅。咁對。

163
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:41,260
工作我哋主要係符合翻誒經合組織去所定下嗰個共同嘅匯報標準，呢一個共同表匯報標準亦都適用於參加呢個誒誒税務資料自動交換計劃嗰一百個國家地區，咁變咗我哋都係依翻嗰個國際嘅標準要求嚟做，亦都即係回應翻頭先啊。

164
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:17,670
咁誒，跟住我想從兩方面嚟講嘅話咧，就頭先與會者嗰個意見表誒，即係提出一啲我哋初步嘅一個誒回應。首先就係誒，究竟誒有啲乜嘢嘅工作我哋會跟進，令到呢一個誒法例修訂之後嗰個執行工作係可以比較順暢啲咧。第二方面，我哋亦～

165
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:47,110
首先就嗰個執行工作方面嚟講嘅話咧，我哋誒好感謝就係其實喺過去嗰兩個月時間，好多團體、好多誒商會都畀咗一啲意見，我哋點樣可以令到呢一個修例嘅執行工作可以做得好啲。我哋非常之同意銀行公會同埋係私人財富管理公會頭先所提出。

166
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:24,510
第二方面嚟講，就話咧，我哋亦都好同意，即係誒兩個工會所提出一個意見，就話即係誒宣傳教育係好重要嘅。我哋都要令到啲客户市民係知道有呢一個噉嘅訴求，變咗佢哋係可以容易配合翻嗰個財務機構啊，或者銀行嗰啲同事嘅嘅查詢啦，噉樣。咁所以。

167
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:44,520
其實，如果大家有留意嘅話咧，係配合呢一個誒AEOY呢個税務資料自動交換協議，誒喺今年一月正式係法例實施嘅話咧，我哋喺上年年尾已經係做咗啲宣傳單張、誒宣傳海報啦，係畀一啲金融機構、銀行就貼喺啲多間地方，等佢哋客户。

168
00:27:44,520 --> 00:28:04,530
知道啦，亦都準備咗個宣傳短片同埋宣傳聲帶。其實，如果大家有留意咧，可能喺電視啊、電台都久唔久聽到我哋呢啲宣傳嘅。咁因應翻今次呢個修訂嚟講嘅話咧，我哋會更新我哋嗰個即係誒宣傳短片同埋宣傳聲帶。我哋今次嘅重點咧就提出就係話誒，而家已經有。

169
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:24,540
超過七十多個嘅國家地區係列入咗呢個衰薪報名單㗎啦，咁所以變咗希望嗰啲市民或者係嗰啲客户嚟講嘅話咧，佢都會有個即係提醒，就係咦，可能佢可能覺得上年香港都係淨係將英國同埋日本放咗落嗰個衰薪報名單嘅啫，可能有一段時間都未輪到我啊噉樣樣。

170
00:28:44,600 --> 00:29:04,610
咁做誒另一方面嚟講嘅話咧，頭先誒銀行公會嘅同事同埋誒誒私人財富管理公會嘅同事都亦都提及到，就係話誒銀行喺嗰個循規金融機構循規嗰方面嚟講，都有一啲誒誒好大量嘅工作，睇一睇究竟我哋係咪可以喺時間嗰方面即係。

171
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,550
唔急，希望立法會能夠考慮呢一個法例修訂，就有個噉嘅背景喺度。

172
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,460
會或者一啲即係即係誒查詢，因為如果啲客户佢哋明白。

173
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:19,210
聯繫啊，或者有啲有啲糾纏嘅話咧，呢個我哋就唔想，所以變咗我哋會覺得，如果個法例要求係清晰一致嘅話咧，呢個係可能係對財務機構或者客户係好嘅。

174
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:52,170
個即係特殊環境之下所作出嘅一個一次性嘅嘅嘅安排，就只係提交二零一七年嘅下半年嘅資料。以後嚟講嘅話咧，所有查問嘅機構都係整年整年去去收集資料㗎啦。

175
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:24,620
誒誒係可以容許多啲咧。譬如佢哋提出咗個建議，就係話係咪可以誒？如果誒税務局未同有關地區或者係國家簽訂咗嗰個雙邊交換協議嘅之前嚟講，嗰啲資料可以暫時儲喺嗰個財務機構先，唔需交畀税務局住呢個建議。我哋係理解。

176
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:57,480
呢個資料交收係即係香港同埋誒誒經合組織同埋佢嘅成員國嘅一個即係誒國誒誒誒國際嘅嘅義務嚟嘅，變咗我哋都好緊張，即係我係第一次即係出年去交換呢啲資料嘅時候，係咪做得妥當咧？所以我哋都希望。

177
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:17,490
有個比較穩妥啲嘅做法，嗰個財務機構或者係銀行，如果收集咗資料嘅話咧，即係嚟緊呢一，即係如果我哋呢個法例修訂通過嘅話咧，嗰七十三個地區今年下半年嗰啲相關客户資料，咁啲財務機構就要去儲啦。咁然之後，當出年五月二零一八年五月，當税務局。

178
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:37,500
要求提供嗰啲資料嘅時候咧，喺財務機構咧就要提供呢啲資料啦。我哋就希望財務機構能夠將整全嘅資料去交畀税務局，因為噉樣樣嘅話咧，就令到有兩個好處嘅。我哋睇落去，第一個好處咧就係誒誒政府或者税務局，我哋可以睇一睇誒財務機構嗰。

179
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:57,510
個誒執行嗰個情況係咪理想或者順暢咧？如果有問題嘅話咧，我哋可以提早同佢哋去去處理噉樣樣。同埋另一方面咧，我哋都擔心，如果誒假如有啲財務機構只係畀咗啲即時需要交換嗰啲資料，税務局先一啲未需要即時交換嘅啲資。

180
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:17,520
料嘅話咧，佢哋就儲住先。萬一嚇，萬一如果即係有啲意外發生，嗰個財務機構突然間誒，因為一啲事情，佢啲資料真係消失咗、流失咗啦。咁但係嗰個責任其實始終仲喺香港喺税務局各方面㗎嘛。咁所以我就覺得，如果一啲即係資料能夠，

181
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:56,040
第二方第二個誒建議嚟講嘅話咧，就係誒頭先誒誒有兩個工會亦都有提及到，就話究竟誒我哋可唔可以畀個選擇啲財務機構係誒提供一年嘅，即係二零一七年一整年嘅資料，而唔係淨係今年二零一七年下半年咧噉樣樣。

182
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:16,180
咁呢一個，我哋其實係有考慮到嘅。嗯，我哋而家嗰個修例嗰個要求咧，就係希望嗰啲財務機構係能夠提供二零一七年下半年嘅資料。以後嚟講嘅話咧，就會一整年。今年提供半年資料，其實呢個特別安排，因為其實當我哋早前同。

183
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:36,190
經合組織傾嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，其實佢就好想香港係提交二零一七年整年嘅資料嘅。咁但係我哋有鑑於就係話，如果我哋要做呢一個工作嘅話咧，都一定係要修改咗個法例，將嗰個法律要求清楚誒話咗畀啲財務機構聽，然之後先可以執行得到嘅。而

184
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:56,200
我哋亦都理解，雖然香港嗰啲財務機構可能大部分都已經係用緊一個即係wide嘅approach去蒐集曬所有税務佢誒誒客户嗰啲資料啊，但係亦都有唔少嘅財務機構其實佢哋係諗住用一個聚焦嘅方式，用一個target嘅approach，只係蒐集。

185
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:16,210
列於税務條例入邊一啲需申必須申報地區嘅資料嘅噉，所以我哋喺同機構組織解釋同埋係商討咗一輪之後嘅話咧，我哋咧就話我哋可能又要立法，又要畀啲時間金融機構準備嘅話咧，我哋最多都係交到二零七一七年下半年嘅資料。所以點解我哋要咁？

186
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,240
誒係會跟住去做嘅。

187
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:19,590
嚟講嘅話咧，就係加埋我哋原先嘅日本同埋英國，總共係有七十五個地區啦，噉樣。

188
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:18,290
都係國際間嗰個嗰個嗰個誒，即係誒大家嗰個誒認知嚟嘅，咁變咗喺呢一方面，我哋係。

189
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:10,810
用税務資料交換嘅計劃嚟講嘅話咧，所交換啲資料咧係有個共同匯報標準。經合組織已經幫到各所有國家定曬嗰個要交嘅資料同埋個類別出嚟啦，大家跟從嘅。

190
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:18,620
咧，我哋都一定要確保我哋交換嘅對象，佢喺個資料保密方面係能夠經過到經合組織嗰個評審係合格，我哋先會交換資料嘅。如果佢過唔到經合組織嗰個資料保密嗰關嘅話咧，我哋係唔會交換住。咁呢個希望唔能夠畀到嗰個誒信心。

191
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:40,840
咁如果即係當然，從從經合組織或者其他税務區嚟講嘅話咧，能夠收多啲資料，收到一整年嘅資料咧，我諗佢哋係絕對歡迎嘅。但係我哋就擔心，如果提供呢一個選擇畀財務機構嘅話，又話就可能會引致到一啲不必要，即係同客户之間嘅一啲即係唔。

192
00:33:46,740 --> 00:34:06,750
嗰個法例或者O.E.C.D.對香港嗰個基本要求就只係交下半年嘅資料嘅啫。如果有啲財務機構係提供佢一整年嘅資料嘅話咧，有啲客户就可能會即係覺得係咪必須咧？或者係又同財務機構個方面有個有有有個有有有啲即係。

193
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:39,510
咁當然，我哋明白，對於嗰啲已經係用緊個wide pose用緊一個全面嘅方式去收集誒客户資料嗰啲財務機構或者銀行嘅話咧，提供一整年資料嗰個嗰個難度嚟講嘅話咧，一定係係低過交半年做半年嘅話咧，佢可能仲要做啲額外功夫添。但係我哋希望佢哋能夠理解我哋呢一個。

194
00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:13,300
咁誒，剛才誒譚偉雄先生亦都有提到，就係話誒，我哋同歐盟啊，或者係同其他國家去決定係咪交換資料嗰個誒考慮喺邊一度咧噉樣。咁或者我都可以喺度再解釋多次，就係其實我哋今次將七十三個新

195
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:33,310
嘅誒税務地區放入我哋嗰個必須申報名單入邊咧，主要係包含咗三類嘅嘅誒國家同埋地區嘅第一落第一個考慮咧，就將歐盟二十八個成員國全部放曬落去噉，因為呢一個我哋明白歐盟係有一個即係評審嘅機制，亦都會製造一個即係。

196
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:53,320
誒不合作税務區嘅名單，所以為咗要滿足歐盟嗰個要求嘅話咧，我哋係將歐盟成個嘅誒名單放曬落嚟。第二個咧就係話，我哋香港本身已經已經同四十個地區啊、誒國家已經係有嗰個誒税務交換誒協議啊，或者個避免雙避免雙重徵。

197
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:13,330
税嗰個協議嘅話咧，我哋亦都將呢啲税務夥伴係放曬落去。第三個類別嚟講嘅話咧，就係經合組織（OECD），佢哋有六十多個國家地區表示係有意同香港去進行交換資料嘅，咁所以我哋都係放咗落去。咁當然入邊係有啲呢三類嘅國家地區有啲重複，所以整合咗之後。

198
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:39,900
咁但係誒，好似頭先誒阿譚生所講嘅話咧，我哋對於嗰個即係資料嗰個交收係係誒係睇得好謹慎嘅。香港一定係會同誒當地誒簽訂咗一個即係雙邊嘅交換協議，或者係。

199
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:59,910
第時，如果我哋參加咗個多邊公約，係透過個多邊公約平台，係有個機制，令到我哋去進行呢啲資料交換，我哋先會交換嘅。我哋唔會立即同嗰七十五個國家地區自動走去交換啲資料嘅。我哋一定係要有個交換資料嘅機制，然之後先會做嘅。另外，頭先啊啊，譚生亦都提及到。

200
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:20,000
嗰個資料嗰個保密性同埋私隱性，呢個我哋係亦都非常之重視嘅。咁所以誒，經合組織其實對於所有參與呢個自動税務資料交換嗰啲國家地區嗰個誒資料保密嗰個誒嗰個準備程度，佢哋都自己有個個別嘅評審嘅。正如我哋上次話畀議員。

201
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:40,010
聽嘅嚟講嘅話咧，香港其實上年嘅時候經過經合組織嘅評審，我哋係係係合格，誒誒係係係可以做呢一樣嘢嘅。噉我哋亦都從經合組織嗰個理解到咧，全世界嗰一百個參與嘅國家地區嚟講嘅話咧，有啲地區係暫時未達標嘅。

202
00:37:40,340 --> 00:38:00,350
咁當然呢個名單，誒，經合組織係唔會對外公佈嘅。但係我哋參與呢個資料交換計劃嗰一百個國家地區，我哋自己內部係知嘅。咁所以變咗，如果就算我哋第時有咗個雙邊嘅交換協議，或者香港參加咗個多邊公約係可以即係交換資料嘅話，

203
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,190
嘅回應就係話。

204
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,270
首先，嗰個。

205
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,740
講黃嘉玲女士誒，發表埋佢嘅意見先啦，唔該啊，黃女士。

206
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,960
咁同埋，點解要咁急去做一個誒税務管轄區名單嘅更新咧？

207
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:16,510
誒嗰啲區域咧，係咪有互相交接？誒，沒有互相交換到嘅資料嘅咧嚇，係咁多唔該，多謝主席。

208
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:16,560
誒，其實我哋關注嘅事項咧，就係最主要就係話，誒今日嘅修訂咧，係響基於舊年六月税例嘅通過。

209
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:49,120
咁另外，亦都知道喺二零一八年咧，先至作出第一輪嘅申報。噉我哋都想知道就住第一輪嘅申報嘅準備工作同埋嗰個進度係點樣？

210
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:29,210
係唔該曬王女士，誒有冇補充嘅誒答案啊？阿阿黎生，有多謝主席。就阿王女士頭先提出嗰個幾個問題，或者我做個簡單嘅回應，誒。

211
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:30,370
咁但係時間咧係非常之倉促嘅，咁舊年六月至去做一個通過嘅法例，屆今年未夠一年咧就已經係要再作出修訂，咁呢度我哋係作出關注。

212
00:41:49,400 --> 00:42:08,640
咁最後我哋亦都想係提出咧，就係話，既然喺二零一八年先至作出第一輪嘅申報嘅時候咧，咁點解唔等埋誒做咗一次先至作出名單上嘅修訂咧？呢個係我哋所關注嘅。咁同埋我哋，我哋都想問咧，就係而家話新建議加入嘅。

213
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:38,910
大家啦，咁同先阿阿李女士嚟講，亦都有提及到就話誒，我哋去交換嗰啲資料嘅時候嚟講，誒係咪應該係要對方提及到一個比較詳細啲嘅嘅要求，我哋先進行交換咧噉樣。噉我諗阿李女士可能就係講緊嗰個。

214
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:58,920
係一啲誒U.I. on request，即係話其實而家都有嘅。税務當局嚟講嘅話咧，係可以按要求要求對誒其他税務當局係提供資料嘅。噉就同今次我哋做呢一個自動税務資料交換誒，就係有不同嘅。主要有兩個唔同嘅地方，第一個咧就今次呢個A.U.I.呢個自動

215
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:31,100
第二個嚟講嘅話咧，就係誒呢個加知呢啲資料相關資料嚟講嘅話咧，係自動交換嘅，唔使人哋即係只要大家係有個雙邊協議或者參加咗個多邊合約誒多邊公約嘅話咧，都會係自動交換，就唔需要等對方問嘅。咁而頭先阿李女士提及過嗰啲咧，就係話按要求去索取資料呢啲嚟講嘅話。

216
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:51,110
咧而家誒係係有發生嘅噉，但係我哋税務局嚟講嘅話咧，都一路秉持一個宗旨，就一定係要對方能夠提供到佢要求嗰個資料，人相關人士機構嗰個原因，同埋提供到一啲即係確實嘅一啲背景資料，我哋先會去。

217
00:39:51,110 --> 00:40:11,120
去去去跟進嘅，就好似阿李女士講，如果有啲人係好似大海撈針噉樣樣，即係畀畀一大堆名，我哋話你你同我走去畀提供呢啲資料啦。咁如果佢提供唔到一啲具體嘅原因或者具體嘅相關背景資料嘅話咧，噉我哋係有理由係唔去誒，即係誒誒係配合嘅。咁呢一個亦。

218
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:40,530
噉我希望我頭先嗰個即係整體嘅回應能夠係解釋到誒，即係頭先議會者所提出嘅一啲建議或者疑問。咁誒，如果議員係有其他進一步嘅提問，我同埋誒信報嘅同事係好樂意進一步解答嘅。唔該，主席。好，唔該曬阿黎生。誒，不如我哋而家畀翻啊六分鐘時間畀公民黨。

219
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:32,700
即係蓄意，即係誒提供一啲虛假或者係篡改咗啲資料嘅話咧，呢一啲先會係嗰個法例嗰啲懲處機制嘅處理重點咯。

220
00:40:44,370 --> 00:41:04,380
誒多謝主席。噉啊，其實公民黨咧都好喺原則上咧係支持香港去遵守經合組織所提出嘅自動交換財務帳務帳户資料嘅標準嘅。咁但係喺誒今日嘅修訂裏邊咧，我哋都有些少關注嘅。咁因為頭先都都聽到。

221
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:51,870
我諗啊，黃女士提出嗰個問題，可能誒有啲業界代表都會話，其實立法會都係上年六月通過呢一個即係自動税務資料交換呢一個噉嘅法律框框架嘅啫。點解我哋咁快又要作出個修訂咧？做其實個原因做，好似頭先與會者所講，就係近年間國際税務。

222
00:42:51,870 --> 00:43:11,880
合作嗰個嗰個形勢，的確係改變得好快。誒，本來我哋香港的確係想用一個比較循序漸進嘅方法走去做呢一個工作嘅，噉就希望誒盡量減低財務機構嗰個即係工作啊，或者係嗰個循規嘅承擔。呢個就我係最初。

223
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:31,890
點解用一個即係比較獨特啲嘅方法，就係話我哋係透過一個即係雙邊嘅協議嘅形式，係逐個逐個同其他税務區去傾嗰個交換協議翻嚟，而唔係參加個多邊公約，又或者就係當全世界可能已經有成誒八九誒九九十個國家地區。

224
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:51,900
都係用一個wide approach，係用一個全面性嘅要求強制佢哋嘅財務機構將所有嘅地區嘅税務客户資料都係要收集嘅話，而我哋香港就用一個聚焦嘅target approach，只係列於税務條例嗰啲需申報名單嘅地區嗰個誒。

225
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:12,090
誒財務機構先需要收集噉，我哋以往定下落嚟嗰個嘅話咧，係盡量係減輕嗰個財務機構工作。咁但係當我哋嘅法例通過咗之後，喺上一年尾嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，經合組織都向我哋就表示關注，因為佢咧就係擔心，如果我哋香港誒係。

226
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:42,150
要好耐之後先有機會同香港交換到資料，咁所以佢哋對於我哋嘅進度係表示關注嘅。咁誒，所以經合組織同埋歐盟亦都提出咗一樣嘢，就係話佢哋對於即係其他國家地區參與呢個税務資料自動交換嗰個進程係會做個評估，亦誒有需要嘅時候。

227
00:44:42,150 --> 00:45:02,160
會製造一個不合作税務區嘅名單，施以制裁嘅。咁因此喺噉嘅考慮情況之下嘅話咧，我哋就覺得我哋要配合翻嗰個國際新形勢，要加快我哋嗰個進度啦。噉樣樣噉，我哋都明白嗰個時間係比較急嘅。咁所以，我哋都當我哋一揾讓到呢一個建議嘅時候，我係三月頭嘅時候。

228
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:22,170
已經係第一時間係通知財務機構，等佢哋有呢一個噉嘅準備。而第一次去交畀税務局個資料嘅話咧，就會係出年嘅五月。希望都有差唔多一年到嘅時間，等大家去做準備啦。咁誒，頭先阿王女士提及到嗰個交換嗰個時間，其實誒，我哋税務局。

229
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:42,180
同誒其他嘅税務地區第一次交換資料咧，就會係誒即係出年嘅年中噉，所以税務局咧就會要求財務機構咧就會係喺五月或者之前咧就將一啲需要嘅資料就交畀我哋。咁如果呢一個即係誒法例修訂係通過咗嘅話咧？

230
00:45:42,180 --> 00:46:02,190
要交嚟嗰啲名單嘅話咧，就會係牽涉到七十五個嘅國家同埋地區啦。咁誒，呢一個係會第一次我哋喺財務機構個收嗰啲資料，同埋亦都係將會我哋同香港第一次誒同其他地區做做做交收啦。咁所以我哋都好希。

231
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:22,200
希望誒嗰個誒交收能夠做得暢順，變咗誒税務局各方面一定係會有好多即係詳細嘅指引，係畀財務機構同埋。我亦都希望財務機構嘅代表喺度有個放心，因為我哋喺較早之前嘅討論嘅時候咧，佢哋都有部分嘅同事同我表達一個關注，因為。

232
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:38,440
究竟我哋香港，譬如話，我哋將七十五個國家地區放咗落呢個水準報名單之下，我哋幾時會同佢交換資料咧？

233
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:21,540
誒用一個比較獨特啲嘅方法，而且再加上我哋係用一個雙邊協議嘅形式仔去傾嘅話咧，佢哋好擔心一樣嘢就係，可能佢哋好多成員國。

234
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:51,450
每一個參與呢個AUI嘅計劃呢一啲國家地區嚟講嘅話咧，都會評審翻去對於嗰個資料保密嗰個誒誒機制係咪完善嘅？咁誒。

235
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:51,030
會擺幾多經費落去先？譬如我我知道你講唔出話，誒，我會做幾多電視廣告，我會做幾多乜嘢？但係你喺呢個撥付資源去做好呢個溝通教育工作裏邊咧，你可唔可以畀一個資料我哋證明呢個誒？

236
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:42,220
喺税務條例之下係有罰則㗎嘛，即係如果滿足唔到個法例要求，係可能會有即係懲罰刑事責任。噉我哋都向大家解釋，就係話，即係如果我哋係要即係配合國際嗰個税務交税務資料交換工作嘅話咧，一定係需要財務機構嗰個合作。咁如果

237
00:46:42,220 --> 00:47:02,230
如果誒要取得相關嘅資料，我哋要確保相關資料係真確無誤嘅話咧，咁嗰個財務機構要進行一啲盡職審查，呢個係法例要求嚟嘅。咁但係我哋都明白，就係可能喺初期嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，如果財務機構需要多啲即係指引啊。

238
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:22,240
或者係有一啲即係即係誒技術上嘅誤會，揀誒，我哋係可以再釐清嘅話咧，咁誒執法嗰個工作嘅話咧，我哋係會即係適當地處理咯。同埋，我諗我哋嗰啲罰則嚟講嘅話咧，主要係針對一啲係完全冇符合我哋嘅要求，又或者係提高。

239
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:53,770
好唔該曬副秘書長誒，阿陳振英議員，你係有問題噉，多唔多咧？陳議員啊，唔該主席誒，其實啊，第一就想同翻誒，與會一啲公眾人士講，頭先政府都經常強調加嘅唔係七啊二，係七啊三，因為我哋今日就會討論係咪加埋土耳其噉。另外咧就係。

240
00:47:53,770 --> 00:48:13,780
誒大韓民國嘅要求由二零一八年就改做二零一九年先至申報啦。噉我嘅第一個問題就係想問呢樣嘢啦，因為有啲國家交換嗰個年份咧，可能係由O E C D噉樣通知我哋嘅。咁既然好似大韓民國都要求誒話一九年佢先至可以準備好啦，同我哋交換，噉我哋會？

241
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:33,790
會唔會都發一次通知畀其他相關嗰啲七十幾個國家，問一問佢哋喂係咪真係咁急要二零一八？誒，如果你二零一九、二零二零先ready嘅，噉我哋喺嗰個條例裏邊咧，就唔需要咁急就寫二零一八。咁亦都可以滿足到其實頭先我諗咁多公眾人士嘅其中一個誒。

242
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:53,800
誒關注點啦，呢個係第一個問題。第二個問題咧，其實誒我哋上次即係立法會誒同呢個誒財富局同埋O E C D嘅代表午飯嘅時候，我都問過呢個問題。咁頭先誒公眾人士表達就話，如果未簽協議、未準備好嘅，可唔可以資料保留喺誒金融機構先啊？咁誒其實。

243
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:13,810
副秘書長就講得好清楚啦，就唔係咁好啦，就保留喺呢個誒税務局啦。咁頭先亦都講咧，税務局噉，我當日就問嘅，我話如果未準備好嗰啲資料，係咪叫税務局就唔好出去交換住啊？佢話應該誒係可以咁做嘅。咁今日副秘書長又講得更清晰啦，就話誒有一個機制。

244
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:33,820
誒確保咧，就係話已經係滿足到某啲條件咧，我哋先至交換出去。但我希望呢個機制咧，唔好係一個內部嘅機制。可唔可以即係誒公開呢一個機制？譬如到滿足到咩條件之下咧，税務局先至會拎拎啲資料出去同誒另外一個國家交換出嚟咧？咁究竟？

245
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:53,830
呢一個機制可唔可以寫得清楚啲？譬如有個機制有三條啊、兩條啊，定係五條咧噉樣樣。呢個係第二個問題。第三個問題咧，其實我睇緊下個禮拜咧，我哋誒開政制裏邊有講私隱條例第三十三條，關於跨境交換資料。而家第三十三條係未執行嘅，咁所以就諮詢緊。

246
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:13,840
大家嘅意見啦，咁裏邊咧當然有豁免嘅。其中一個好重要嘅豁免就係客户同意啦。咁客户同意咗就你點樣跨境交換都O K㗎啦。噉我見到會計師公會其中一個意見咧，都係提咗咧，就話因為呢個資料交換咗出去咧，其實對嗰個個人嚟講咧嘅。

247
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:33,850
資料就等於好多全世界好多國家咧，就認定呢一個資料咧，愛嚟誒誒確定佢可能係税務啊或者財富嘅一啲來源嘅資料。噉就講咧，希望咧可以提供個比較明確嘅機制，可以讓客户自己咧就去誒做一個更正嘅，即係data correction。

248
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:53,860
啦，噉我想睇下呢度咧，希望政府可以喺誒未來嗰個指引啊，因為佢誒頭先啊副秘書長都講到咧，就會係畀財務機構或者金融機構咧一個新嘅指引，係點樣去收集同埋更改啲資料。噉我希望嗰個誒資料更新機制咧，就要喺你哋未來個。

249
00:50:53,860 --> 00:51:13,870
指引度咧就係明確啲咁誒，對客户嚟講都會比較放心啦。呢個我希望即係睇下副秘書長會唔會有回應。最後一個咧就係其實誒都講過好重要嘅，而家誒好多嘅銀行客户佢係唔知道由英國、日本突然間增加咗七十三個國家，噉我要將呢啲資料咧都要向。

250
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:33,880
向金融機構誒提供嘅咁咧誒，你提到話一定會做好宣傳教育噉，我怕咧就係話誒，因為政府而家好多嘅項目都要做緊噉，我想咧可唔可以誒財富局嗰度明確咧，你會分配喺做呢一個A E O I嘅宣傳教育上邊嚟。

251
00:51:51,640 --> 00:52:11,650
資源係會足夠，讓呢個社會咧能夠誒充分理解呢一樣嘢。如果咪變成個矛盾，就會去咗金融欺詐度啦。噉我主要係呢四個問題，唔該主席。好，唔該曬啊，陳議員，嗯，阿黎副秘書長，啊，唔該曬，唔該主席，亦都多謝啊陳振英議員員，誒，亦都特別係多謝。

252
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:31,660
陳振議員喺即係過去嗰幾個月嚟講，就我哋呢個草擬法例都反映咗好多業業界嘅訴求畀我哋，我哋亦都係盡量去採納咗嘅。咁頭先啊，陳議員提及有誒四個問題，或者我處理咗嗰個自動交換資料啟動嗰個機制先，因為啊，陳議員就好關心就係話。

253
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,580
其實，誒。

254
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,070
嘅誒電台電視台嚟講，我哋都有一個即係。

255
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:38,950
如果嗰啲所謂第一批嘅先導者嘅話咧，就應該係今年二零一七年下半年先去交換資料嘅。

256
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:39,260
係將O.E.C.D.過去嗰段時間一啲更新咗嘅一啲即係執行細節嘅嘢，我哋反映翻喺嗰個即係即係畀金融機構嗰個誒誒誒指引入邊嘅。

257
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:30,890
經合組織對於嗰個誒誒誒A E O I嗰個資料交收嚟講嘅話咧，佢係定咗兩個時間表畀啲國家地區做嘅。

258
00:56:44,570 --> 00:57:00,670
我哋係可以提供嘅。當然，如果當嗰個修例一通過咗嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，喺六月尾、七月、八月呢個開始嘅時間，我哋梗係會再加密多啲我哋新嗰個修訂嗰個宣傳片嗰個播放嘅次數。呢個我哋一定會會記住。希望呢一個工作亦都。

259
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:28,160
當然，究竟邊啲國家被視為不合格嘅話咧，經合組織就唔會喺佢嘅網頁嗰度列出嚟嘅。咁但係其他參與交換資料嗰一百個，即係誒國家地區嗰啲税務當局，佢哋內部係知嘅噉樣。咁所以變咗我哋係可以依翻呢個即係指引嚟做嘅。

260
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:17,590
誒配合到即係財務機構佢同客户嗰個聯繫啦噉樣。最後就係誒阿陳議員提及到韓國誒嗰個情況交換個時間就係二零一九年，就同其他國家係有別。究竟誒我哋可唔可以都改變，或者係有啲咩考慮喺度咧？

261
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:58,830
其實主要有兩個嘅誒考慮點喺度嘅。第一個考慮點咧就係話，我哋法例入邊已經講明咗㗎啦，就一定係要香港同嗰個國家地區有一個即係誒資料交換嘅機制係確立咗，我哋先會做嘅。咁而而家嚟講嘅話咧，就係我哋講緊嗰啲雙邊協議啦，雙邊。

262
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:18,840
資料資料交換協議，我哋簽咗十一個啦。噉，但係我哋都同議員解釋，就我哋亦都積極考慮緊係咪將國際間個多邊公約引入嚟香港。如果香港第時加入咗呢個多邊公約嘅話咧，個多邊多邊公約亦都會成為一個新嘅平台，令到香港可以同多啲國家同其他地區交換資料。呢個係我。

263
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:38,850
我哋交換資料嗰個渠道就一定要有呢個渠道建立咗先得啦噉嘅樣。而第二個考慮咧，就係頭先我喺嗰個整體回應入邊有提提及到，就係話我哋明白資料嗰個保密性同埋嗰個誒使用嗰個恰當性嚟講係非常之重要嘅。呢個亦都係經合組織嗰個指引。所以經合組織對於

264
00:53:51,750 --> 00:54:11,760
我哋誒香港或者係經合組織，亦都講到明咧，就係話如果有國家地區佢嗰個保密機制係有問題，經合組織係誒係唔認同嘅話咧，或者係誒誒誒不不予合格嘅話咧，誒其他地區係唔會同佢交換資料嘅。咁所以呢一個亦都係我哋第二個會確守嘅原則。

265
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:48,630
第二個問題就係話，頭先阿陳議員提及到，咦？究竟我哋今次呢個法例修訂同誒嗰個誒誒私隱條例去保障嗰個個人資訊嗰方面嗰個關聯性係點樣樣咧？其實今次我哋呢個誒法例修訂咧，就應該冇觸及到嗰個誒，即係資。

266
00:54:48,630 --> 00:55:08,640
誒私人資料嗰個誒用途嗰方面嘅誒，因為今次我哋主要都係講改翻嗰個需申報地區嗰個名單，同埋係嗰個資料嗰個收集誒時間。對於嗰個財務機構係點樣去處理嗰啲誒客户嘅個人資料嘅話咧，其實呢個都係沿用。

267
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:28,650
翻即係O E C D嗰個基本要求，同埋亦都反映翻喺上年立法會係通過咗嗰個即係修例框架，嗰個我哋冇觸及嘅，嗰個係會會維持不變嘅。咁而税務局會發畀財務機構一個新嘅指引嘅話咧，其實主要就係反映翻今次嗰個修例嗰個變動啦，同埋可能。

268
00:55:40,090 --> 00:56:00,100
咁誒，頭先阿陳議員亦都好關心到係嗰個宣傳嗰個情況噉樣樣，或者會後我可以蒐集翻個資料咧，就正如我頭先所講，就話我哋其實由上年十二月到到而家嘅話咧，都有不斷透過電台啊、電視台走去做呢個噉嘅即係宣傳片、誒宣傳聲。

269
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:20,110
帶去令到即係市民係對於呢個比較冷門啲嘅課題係希望多啲嘅認識啦。噉樣咁誒，因為我哋誒當然我哋製作呢啲宣傳短片升帶嘅時候，梗係有個一次性嘅開支啦。嗰個我哋係係已經用咗啦。咁但係實際上政府平時喺呢啲即係。

270
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:44,570
指定嘅免費嘅嘅quota或者配額，就係畀我賣廣告嘅，所以變咗我就唔會話，因為即係播多啲係係係要畀錢，噉我哋都係用翻政府成個政府嗰個嗰個個配額嘅啫，或者我都可以會後提供翻個資料，就係話誒，究竟過去嗰個半年嚟講，究竟我哋播咗幾多次咧？噉樣下呢啲客觀嘅資料。

271
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:59,270
最遲叫第二批咧，就係二零一八年。喺我哋當初香港咧，就選擇咗做第二批二零一八年，所以變咗大體嗰個交換時間咧就係二零一八年嘅。咁去到韓國嗰個例子誒點解會特別啲？我係我哋我哋係二零一九年咧噉嘅樣，因為誒韓國嚟講嘅話咧，我哋係今年年初透過個雙。

272
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:19,280
邊協議商討到呢一個嘅資料交換？誒誒，方翻嚟嘅。而我哋當佢同佢傾嘅時候咧，我哋都解釋咗畀韓國同埋其他今年年初簽嗰啲雙邊協議嘅地區聽，就係因為香港，我哋都係要透過一個法例修訂，將佢嗰個國家名放咗落個税務條例個附表十七E入邊。

273
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,030
噉就誒嗰個。

274
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,880
提問嘅就係究竟我哋將嗰啲需申報。

275
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:23,390
税務管轄區嘅誒誒國家地區加入嗰個名單嘅時候，有啲咩準則同埋考慮？

276
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:34,650
你有啲書面嘅陳述係要放低嘅時候咧，可以擺誒放畀我哋嘅職員，多謝曬各位，唔該曬嚇。

277
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:07,270
嗰個法例嗰方面咧，就做翻呢個修訂。所有國家地區嗰個申報年份都係二零一八年，唯獨韓國係二零一九年個年先就喺度。

278
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:32,680
第二個誒誒提問就係話，究竟我哋係咪誒應該將呢啲考慮或者原則係放埋入嗰個法例嗰度咧？噉樣樣。

279
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:52,250
就係今次咧，係政府就呢個修訂條例草案作出一個議稿嘅誒委員會審議階段修正案嘅有兩份文件。

280
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:21,490
嗱，我提嘅分啊，各位委員咧，係上一次嘅會議咧，其實我哋基本上咧已經睇咗嗰份啊，成份藍紙草案嘅啊逐條審議嘅條文。噉啊，政府喺今日嘅會議上邊咧，係有兩份嘅文件，一份係立法會C.B.括弧一。

281
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:39,290
先能夠叫金融機構真係做嘅咁變咗。如果我哋二零一七年將韓國或者相關地區放咗落去嘅話咧，金融機構咧就會由二零一八年開始收集佢哋嗰啲客户資料，第一次交收咧就二零一九年嘅噉。所以透過我哋今年年初簽訂多幾個新嘅雙邊協議嘅國家地區，佢哋明白我哋呢個時間表嘅噉。但係我哋。

282
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:59,300
同時間亦都同佢講就話：咦，因為我哋都同誒經合組織O E C D度傾緊，可能咧都要提早啲將二零一七年下半年嘅資料就同其他人交換啦。咁所以我當時咧就同呢啲主動肯同我哋傾雙邊協議嘅地區講咧，就話：如果我係真係符合翻，即係我係同O E C D就嗰個誒。

283
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:19,310
誒二零一七年下半年提早去蒐集資料，同埋出年交換，係係係達成個事實嘅話咧，我哋都會將呢一個安排新延翻畀我哋今年年初簽定咗雙邊協議嗰啲地區，誒誒誒嘅，因為噉樣樣先會令到一個比較公平合理嘅情況啊嘛。我哋唔會令到一啲。

284
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:39,320
主動肯香港肯早啲同香港簽雙邊協議嗰啲地區就遲收資料，反而其他後面嚟嗰啲就可以早啲收到資料。呢個我哋就唔想嘅。咁但係誒，我哋同翻今年年初同我哋新簽雙邊協議嗰幾個地區講話，誒，我哋可以同你誒喺二零一八年誒交換二零一。

285
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:59,330
七年下半年嘅資料咯，噉樣其他國家地區係誒歡迎嘅，唯獨誒韓國咧就同我哋講就話你都唔使啦，不如我哋用翻我哋最開頭嗰雙邊協議，你收集到二零一八年資料，二零一九年交畀我哋啦。噉樣係得佢一個係表達咗一個特殊嘅嘅要求嘅啫。噉我哋都即係尊重翻個要求，所以就喺。

286
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:27,700
好啊，唔該曬你，係啊，陳議員，你仲冇問題問其他嘅團體或一個人啊？今日議會嘅冇啦，唔該主席，係唔該曬啊啊，噉啊，今個會議嘅上半部咧，就係同團體會面或一個人會面嘅時間已經係係完成咗啦，噉就好多謝誒各位議會嘅人士，如果。

287
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:41,780
九一五斜洞十六-hyphen十七括弧零二號文件。嗯，另外咧，誒呢一份文件咧就係有一啲誒上次會議提出嘅關注事項作出回應，而另外一份文件咧就係C B括弧一九一五斜洞十六-hyphen十七零三號文件。

288
01:01:52,530 --> 01:02:12,540
咁即係就而家請誒政府介紹下啊呢兩份文件先啦。唔該，誒邊位啊？好啊，黎生唔該，係誒唔該，主席誒首先講翻我哋誒跟進翻四月廿五號個會議提供嗰份誒補充資料文件啦。咁主要就係回應翻議員兩個嘅誒。

289
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:36,840
需申報。

290
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,870
誒有冇委員？

291
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,840
有問題。

292
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,160
好，唔該曬啊，副秘書長。

293
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:05,520
啊！我我想有一個問題咧，就到韓國嗰個修訂，就將嗰個誒年份。

294
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:52,680
陣間議員提及到，即係誒韓國嗰個申報年份咧，就由二零一八年，就改做為二一二零一九年，就配合翻韓國佢本身嗰個要求嘅。噉我哋嗰個修正案都係技術性係相對簡單嘅啫，就希望議員去誒誒審議。

295
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:57,200
税務管轄地區嗰個名單，今次而家我哋有七十五個國家地區喺度嘅話咧，就正如我哋文件所説，就係話其實我哋誒都係參考翻有三個嘅誒誒考慮因素，就係我哋嗰份文件嘅三B嗰度提及嗰三個因素，即係頭先我亦都喺第一。

296
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:17,210
嘅時候解釋過，個個個誒主要就係即係歐盟成員國啊，誒香港嗰啲税務夥伴啊，同埋係向經合組織表示有香港有意同香港交換資料嗰啲國家地區嘅。咁誒，我哋都係用翻呢三個考考慮，係將嗰啲即係國家地區名放落嗰個誒税務條例誒附表。

297
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:37,220
十七二入邊嘅，咁誒，我哋就會覺得一樣嘢，如果係能夠令到誒大家有個彈性去處理呢一啲誒名單嘅時候嚟講嘅話咧，我哋未必需要將嗰個即係考慮嘅因素或者準則都要放埋落個法例嗰度。最主要一樣嘢就係其實我。

298
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:57,230
個政策考慮都喺我哋嗰個即係政策文件嗰邊向立法會解釋咗啦，同埋更加重要一個考慮咧，就係話如果我哋第時任何時候要再修改即係誒附表十七E嘅話咧，我哋都要以一個即係附屬法例嘅形式提交畀立法會審議嘅。咁誒，立法會係可以透過個先即係會。

299
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:17,240
我哋會以一個先定立後審議嘅嘅形式交畀立法會去考慮，咁變咗立法會絕對係有個即係即係誒誒控制權喺度，睇一睇就話究竟政府提嗰個建議係咪合理咧？係或者係嗰個誒誒考量係咪係合適咧噉樣？咁所以我哋覺得誒唔好再即係唔好不必要。

300
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:37,250
要哋即係複雜嗰個法例，或者令到我哋喺執行方面有個彈性嘅話咧，可能我哋透過誒立法會而家對於嗰個誒附表十七E都已經有個審批權，呢一樣嘢其實都應該處理到大家議員嗰個關注㗎啦。咁至於嗰個誒誒委員會審議階段修正。

301
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:57,260
案嚟講嘅話咧，其實我哋都係兩個簡單嘅技術修訂嘅啫。第一個咧就係將土耳其就係加入落去啦噉樣，因為喺誒經合組織嘅秘書處最近同我哋講咧就話誒誒G二十集團誒二十國集團入邊嚟講嘅話咧，有兩個國家未喺香港嗰個名。

302
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:17,270
單入邊嘅一個咧就美國，一個就土耳其。美國就簡單啦，因為美國根本佢冇參加A.U.I呢個國際合作嘅，佢自己已經有factor啦。咁但係土耳其嚟講嘅話咧，佢哋其實就揾樣緊，就向我哋提出嘅噉。基於誒，佢土耳其都係二十國集團嘅一個重要成員，變咗我諗，我哋都可以將我哋嗰個誒，即係需需。

303
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:37,280
推進部地地區名單包埋土耳其先，正如我頭先所説咧，就係話我哋都唔會即刻出年同土耳其即刻交交換資料住嘅，一定係要有咗個即係渠道，究竟係一個誒雙邊協議啊，或者係透過個多邊公約嘅渠道，我哋先會同相關國家地區去交換嘅。第二個咧就頭先阿陳。

304
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:48,770
唔該，主席做其實做誒。

305
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:27,150
我我想再重申一下啦，阿阿黎生就係話，究竟O E C D啊對香港嗰個要求？

306
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:17,350
時間呢個要求係佢自己提出嘅話咧，我哋作出配合，所以變咗即係經合組織。如果跟住要去做審誒即係評審嘅話咧，我哋亦都係交代得到，係相信冇問題。

307
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:44,320
啊，係乜嘢嘢咧？究竟係咪二零一七年底以前要有曬呢？啊，七十五個國家喺我哋個法例嗰度，同埋啊，二零一八年要進行呢個資料交換呢個係係係個即係佢評審嘅準則咧嚇。

308
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:25,810
啊，改咗咧。其其實喺O E C D層面有冇一啲咩concern嘅？即係韓國同O E C D本身，或者即係點解佢佢可以做咗呢樣嘢？係係係改咗個年份，而其他即係嘅jurisdiction又要係即係。

309
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:45,820
要即係完全配合翻O E C D嘅嘅誒準則咧嚇啊，我想問一問嚇。明白主席個問題誒，韓國個情況咧就比較特別啲，因為佢同我哋香港大家個雙邊嘅協議去達成呢個自動交換資料嘅誒嘅情況嘅噉，所以嗰個具體個交換時間咧就真係我。

310
01:06:45,820 --> 01:07:05,830
我哋自己兩個國家係可以決定嘅。至於韓國，佢同其他國家係二零一七年交換資料定二零一八年資料咧，就嗰啲佢同其他嗰啲經合組織成員嘅嘅嘅情況啦。呢個就唔係我哋會會關注嘅地方。但係，既然韓國佢佢覺得佢唔需要咁早交換資料，呢個。

311
01:07:49,600 --> 01:08:09,610
喺我哋交畀立法會嗰份即係背景資料文件入邊咧，亦都有提及到就話，即係經合組織去做呢一個評審過程，主要係睇三個嘅考慮因素。第一個咧就係話喺處理一啲按要求交換資料嗰個誒誒進度成績係咪達標。第二個。

312
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:29,620
我嚟講嘅話咧，就係佢誒有冇一個雙邊嘅一個廣泛嘅雙邊誒條約機制，或者係參與咗嗰個多邊公約，令到佢同可以同好多誒誒誒經合組織嘅成員國係快捷大規模到交換到資料嘅。而第三。

313
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:49,630
個考慮咧，就係話佢哋係可係咪可以交換到誒二零一七一七年嘅資料？咁基於呢個三個考慮嚟講嘅話咧，所以我哋誒覺得，亦都我哋後尾同經合組織所講所講翻咧，就係話，如果要香港去同誒經合組織其他地區去交。

314
01:08:49,630 --> 01:09:09,640
二零一七年整年嘅資料，我哋的確有困難，因為我哋未完成嗰個法例修訂工作。但係我哋會盡我哋嘅能力去嘗試同立法會去去商議，係咪要求財務機構交二零一七年下半年嘅資料咧？噉樣，咁呢一個經合組織係接受嘅，佢接受我哋呢個節儉安排。咁所以，我哋提出呢個法例修訂係配合。

315
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:29,650
到佢呢個要求噉，跟住誒第二個嗰個重點就係話，究竟我哋嗰個香港嗰個誒雙邊協議嗰個誒規模係咪可以好大好快去同誒誒經合組織其他嗰九十幾一百個國家地區交換資料咧？噉樣。

316
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:49,660
呢度我哋係努力當中嘅，所以我哋喺文警入邊亦都同議員講就話，我哋一方面繼續盡快簽多啲呢啲協議啦，但係另一方面嚟講嘅話咧，我哋而家積極係考慮係咪透過係咪參與國際間嗰個多邊公約，去令到我哋促成呢件事情嘅。你所講嘅協議係指啊税務。

317
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,120
啊！

318
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,490
咧，因為誒國際。

319
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,840
咁呢個都係我哋嗰個工作方向。

320
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,870
幾個嘅誒CDTA同埋Tier嘅夥伴入邊，我哋簽咗十一份嘅雙邊協議。

321
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:34,580
係，嗯，我想問一問咧，啊，委員對政府提出嗰個CSC修訂案有冇有冇乜嘢嘅意見？啊，法律顧問有冇咩意見啊？

322
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:14,930
即係嗰個喺誒誒第四十九誒一A嗰個嗰個即係提述啦，咁變咗對於嗰個豁免方面會唔會係誒個適應性嗰邊咧有個影響咧？因為今次嘅交換裏邊有一啲國家咧係可能。

323
01:09:49,660 --> 01:10:09,670
資料交換協議，淨係唔係即係亦都係包括埋呢個全面避免雙重徵税協議，即係話兩種都包括咧。究竟啊，誒主席誒，或者頭先我講得唔清楚，就係我哋其實而家透過一個雙邊嘅形式去達至呢個税務資料接。

324
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:29,680
用交換嘅話咧，其實係有兩個層次嘅。首先，我哋一定要同香香港要同當個當地有一個即係税務資料交換協議個Tia啦Tia，又或者我哋有個C.D.T.A.有個避免雙重誒誒徵税協議噉樣。呢個係個基礎。咁而家我哋香港有同四十幾個國家地區有。

325
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:49,690
有咗呢啲噉嘅即係雙邊協議啦，咁但係有呢個雙邊協議都唔夠嘅，我哋都仲要同嗰啲每一個嘅條約方再簽一個雙邊資料交換協議，針對翻呢個AEOI呢個税務資料交換先製做嘅。咁所以我哋誒點？

326
01:10:49,690 --> 01:11:09,700
而家上年，我哋提出修訂嗰個誒税務條例十七E，將日本同埋英國加入去咧。其實我哋同日本英國本身已經係有個C D T簽咗嘅，只不過我哋去到上年年尾嘅時候，再同佢哋簽埋嗰個就A E O嗰個雙邊間換協議，所以我哋先放落去嘅。咁而家直到呢刻為止，喺我哋嗰四十。

327
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:37,500
好唔該曬，嗯，陳議員嚇，唔該你，唔該主席。我誒，其實對條例我冇意見，但係我想誒，即係政府當局確認一下，因為而家，例如我哋而家審緊咧，就係自動交換税務資料啦。咁但係我哋亦都有反洗錢㗎啦，誒，反恐融資啦，巴塞二三誒，同。

328
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:57,510
同埋Resolution Regime啊，等等嘅一係列國際嘅要求。噉，我想誒呢度咧，好似我哋係由本來符合一個最低標準要求，突然間加快為一個即係比較快嘅要求啦。但係誒做完呢個之後咧，我係希望政府係咪可以同我哋講翻，我哋仍然係會採用咧。

329
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:19,780
每一個城市之間咧都係一個競爭關係，或者區域啊之間都有競爭關係。如果你採取一個比平均要緊嘅標準咧，其實係對香港係不利嘅。咁其實我知道好多委員誒上一次會議都表達過類似嘅意見，所以我想問下咧，就係話誒，我哋係咪雖然呢一次A U I好似我哋突然間。

330
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:39,790
加快咗啦，但係唔改變咧。香港喺一啲引入國際嘅法例或者條文嘅時候咧，仍然係採用即係符合最基本原則嘅標準。我唔會咧係比人哋特別要快啲，令到我哋嘅營商環境或者金融機構誒客户啊等等咧，面對一個誒比其他地方誒。

331
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:59,800
不利嘅處境咯，唔該主席。好啊，黎生有冇回應啊？誒，多謝主席。誒，我哋非常之同意陳振英議員嗰個誒觀點嘅，即係作為一個國際金融中心，香港有需要保保持翻我哋作為一個國際金融中心獨特嘅優勢，但係另一方面，我哋亦都要配合翻國際間嗰個。

332
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:19,810
即係税務合作啊，或者係其他即係金融合作方面嘅要求。咁所以我哋政府嗰個出發點嚟講嘅話咧，都係一定係以香港個情況同埋個利益為我哋嘅首要首要考慮。喺配合嗰個即係國際合作嘅方面嚟講嘅話咧，我哋希望能夠做到最基本嗰個要求啦，噉樣。

333
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,180
好，唔該曬。

334
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,590
點樣咧？佢個評審過程究竟係？

335
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:43,680
啊，黎生唔該曬誒，唔該主席，多謝誒法律顧問嗰個問題。

336
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:37,000
誒或者嗰個誒帳户持有人嗰個特別個指明嘅同意，先可以將啲資料交換畀你哋咧。

337
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:22,670
於而家個私隱條例對於部分税務資料嘅嗰個豁免要求，同我哋今次呢個修訂應該係冇抵觸嘅。

338
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:13,990
有一啲交換資料安排嗰個個國際協議嗰度，我哋就係刪走咗，令到我哋係可以將七十五個，即係七十。

339
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:51,620
我仲有提一提，政府求先咧，對於與會團體嘅求先嘅口頭回應咧，請你哋係係提交翻一份嘅書面嘅回應啊，畀呢個委員會。

340
01:17:52,020 --> 01:18:05,970
啊！我再想問一問誒，我哋嘅委員仲有冇關於呢一條誒税務條例修訂第三號草案有咩其他嘅問題？無論係個啊政策上，或者係嗰個字眼上等等啊～

341
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:30,370
未簽定呢一啲安排，但係咧誒財務機關咧都要向你哋提交嘅喎。咁誒如果冇得到呢個豁免嘅時候，財務機關係咪都要得到翻誒呢個税務人？

342
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:39,630
嗱，如果各位委員對誒今次嘅誒committee station amendment誒個草稿係冇意見嘅話咧，我就請政府正式即係提出呢一個啊修訂嘅議案嗱，嗯。

343
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:57,250
修正咧，我哋已經誒就住佢嘅草擬方面咧，就誒睇過㗎啦，咁冇發現有咩問題。咁誒，但係咧，我就有另外一個問題咧，就係關於誒嗰個對於私隱條例嗰個影響嗰度嘅，因為剛才誒誒誒政府嘅方面咧就誒講過咧，就係話今次。

344
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:17,260
嗰個修訂，即係主要係對於誒嗰個税務管核區個定義咧，就將誒佢誒嗰個效力咧，就係話使呢一個申報管核區咧，就能夠包括一啲香港以外嘅地區，就不論佢有冇參與嗰個誒雙邊有效嘅安排噉樣樣嘅咁誒。

345
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:37,270
誒而家誒現存嗰個私隱條例裏邊咧，就係第誒五十八條嗰度咧，就就住誒一啲税務誒一啲境外嘅税務嘅事宜誒嘅交換咧，就有一個闊面噉樣嘅。咁嗰度咧就特別係指明咧，就係話如果係嗰啲税務。

346
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:57,280
個安排係就誒就住誒呢個税務條例裏邊第四十九一大A嗰度有誒安排嘅話咧，就可以得得到豁免，就唔需要誒誒即係受嗰個誒資料保護條例第三同埋第六嗰個規限噉樣。咁今次嘅修訂因為剔除咗嗰個安。

347
01:15:43,960 --> 01:16:03,970
誒，我哋個睇法就係，嗯，今次我哋係做咗一個技術嘅修訂，將可以列入喺即係税務條例附表十七E嗰啲需申報地區嘅名單入邊，我哋就將嗰個即係誒需要。

348
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:34,340
誒三個新嘅地區國家名單加入去啦。呢一個係純粹從財務機構蒐集資料嗰個誒工作係入手嘅啫。咁但係嚟講嘅話咧，就好似我頭先所講咧，就係話呢啲所收集翻嚟嘅資料嚟講嘅話咧，係唔會即刻係同外國嘅地區。

349
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:54,350
國家交換住嘅一定係要建基於，好似頭先法律顧問所講，就話我哋用翻税務條例四十九一A嗰個要求，香港一定係要同嗰個相關地區國家係有咗個即係協議，就好似頭先阿阿梁主席所問一樣嘢，就係話咦，究竟我哋點樣有啲咩考量先會同？

350
01:16:54,350 --> 01:17:14,360
嚟交換咧，就係我頭先所講，就話我哋一定係要用翻而家嗰個機制，又或者第時，假如香港有一個新機制啦，係要透過多邊公約啦噉樣，變咗我哋都要將呢一個新嘅機制，可能要透過另一個法例修訂放咗落去先得噉樣。咁變咗我哋個睇法就係話喺噉嘅情況之下，我哋對。

351
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:27,180
好的，噉我都誒覺得係誒呢條條例草案誒個安排咧係誒合適，同埋雖然我都聽到咧有啲議會團體覺得真係做得急過頭，亦都可能對誒一啲嘅財務機構嗰個誒資源或者時間係造成一啲壓力。

352
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:47,190
咁希望政府可以儘量係提供到誒適當嘅協助。我仲想一個最後嘅問題問一問咧，誒你話O E C D咧政府講係一個啊評審，咁其實佢哋幾時會嚟香港係作出呢個評審？有冇係咪會send一隊人嚟啊？點？

353
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:20,950
幾千個。

354
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,130
好。

355
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:03,580
從做呢個自動資料交換嘅。

356
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:15,000
咁政府有冇一啲嘅誒意見咧？對於呢兩個日子。

357
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:50,200
委員會去提交報告，而任何嘅委員會審議階段嘅修正案咧，必須喺五月二十七號或者之前提出。

358
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:40,740
緊第二階段嘅就審核緊我哋香港嘅進行自動資料交換有關嘅法例係唔係合符咧？就經合組織嘅標準嘅。

359
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:20,080
好，誒，我想問一問啦，誒，政府希望恢復呢一條啊税務修訂第三號草案嘅日期係有冇一啲嘅誒心目中嘅日子咧？請問啊？

360
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:32,160
主席，我哋都希望越快越好啦。如果六月七號嗰個做得到嘅話，就試一試六月七號。我哋將我哋嗰啲需要嘅嘅資料啊，或者係嗰啲書面回應都下個禮拜初擺低畀秘書處，睇下可唔可以同秘書處一齊可以。

361
01:18:50,710 --> 01:19:10,720
主席，我我我將我理解講誒講下，或者如果有有需要嘅話，阿趙局長可以補充翻。好好誒，評審，我諗可能有兩方面。第一方面咧，就係頭先講到嗰個，即係香港或者每一個參與國家地區嗰個資料保密個機制嚟講嘅話咧，佢真係要有個即係實地視察嘅。

362
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:30,730
上年誒年中嚟咗香港，跟住睇完之後，我話我哋合格呢個佢有個實地審審查嘅。至於你話頭先，我哋我介紹就話經合組織佢係評察嗰個參與嘅國家地區整體個表現係咪合格嗰三個嘅嘅準則，有冇需要將佢列入嗰個？

363
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:50,740
嘅即係不合作税務地區名單嘅話咧，呢一個我估佢就未必需要一定做個實地評誒審審查，因為實際上佢而家定期都要我哋交報告，究竟我哋做成點，同幾多國家交換資料，或者係簽訂咗幾個雙邊協議。咁誒呢一方面嚟講嘅話咧，就誒呢個噉嘅進度報告，佢一路係要我。

364
01:19:50,740 --> 01:20:10,750
我哋交緊嘅，所以佢睇到我哋嘅進度好似慢咗啲，就向我哋作出咗一啲提點，要我哋希望快馬加鞭噉啊！或者睇下阿趙生有冇？係趙副局長。好多謝主席嗱，就經合組織裏邊嗰個評審香港進行嗰個自動資料交換咧，其實佢係用一個咧嘅分階段性嘅檢。

365
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:30,760
驗嘅喺去年二零一六年嘅時候，佢主要檢驗緊香港嗰個保密同埋有關嘅法律係咪合規嘅。咁喺二零一六年嗰次咧，佢有派隊誒人員嚟香港嘅，係實地去睇嘅。噉就就呢一方面咧，我哋香港係合格嘅。咁現時咧，佢亦都進行。

366
01:20:41,020 --> 01:21:01,030
噉我諗喺第三階段咧，佢就其實而家呢個嘅檢驗咧已經係進行緊。我要指出，噉我諗喺未來嘅日子，佢再進一步睇下香港係咪真係有效地落實自動資料交換，係咪同咧所有有興趣同香港誒進行資料交換嘅税務管轄區真真正正。

367
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:41,240
嗱，而家我哋誒秘書處就提供咗兩個日期嘅。第一個咧就係恢復二讀辯論嘅日期，係第一個咧係二零一七年嘅六月七號。嗱，如果我哋用呢一個日子嘅時候咧，我哋你必須要喺二零一七年嘅五月十九號咧，係向財誒內務委。

368
01:21:50,750 --> 01:22:10,760
咁第二個日期咧就係恢復二讀嘅辯論日期咧，可以係喺六月十四號。如果用呢個日子嘅話咧，向內務委員會提交報告日期咧變咗會係六月嘅二號，而委員會審議階段嘅修正案嘅提出日期咧就會係六月五號。

369
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,390
好噉啊！

370
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,000
我亦都宣佈會議結束啦，多謝曬。

371
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:25,300
