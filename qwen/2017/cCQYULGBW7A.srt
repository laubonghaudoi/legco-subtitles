1
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,190
咁今日咧。

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
今日夠法定人數，而家開會。

3
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,620
我哋有啊。

4
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:49,110
其他委員嘅論點，或者重複公務小組委員會嘅討論，更廣泛嘅政策問題咧，應該喺立法會或者事務委員會上提出。

5
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:00,860
我亦都呼籲委員咧，如果有意提交三十七A咧，請盡早咧係提交，等我同秘書咧有充分嘅時間處理。啊，我申報咧，我係東亞銀行嘅獨立非執行董事。

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:39,750
有今天嘅會議處理事咧，係有直接或者間接金錢利益嘅話咧，整委員按照好似規則第八十三呢條咧，喺就該事發言之前咧披露有關嘅利益性質。我亦都請委員注意呢條規則第八四條有關係有直接金錢利益之下表決嘅規定。

7
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:22,220
我哋今日同埋聽日咧共安排咗六次會啊，處理議程上嘅項目。今次第一次會議完結之後咧，我哋休息五分鐘。第二次會議咧會喺下午四時三五分開始，同埋咧喺下午六時三五分係結束嘅。如果需要咧，我會將會議最多延長十五分鐘。我提醒委員咧，假如委員就。

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:01:00,560
我哋繼續F.C.O.二零一七一百十四。你等我講埋個會議安排先嚇。呢個項目係整本委員會咧通過公務小組委員會喺二零一七年咧五月三一號咧會上所提出嘅建議內容咧係將二七二R.S.號工程計劃咧如下部分提升為甲級，按付款當日價格計算咧。

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:20,570
估計所需費用咧係三一八三百一十八億九千八百萬，用以興建咧體德體育園區，以支持咧香港體育運動嘅進一步發展。公務小組咧曾經喺五個會議上咧討論有關建議，審議約十一時廿三分。政府咧亦都提交咗多份嘅資料文件。

10
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:40,580
財委會喺六月十七號嘅會議咧，審議咗本項目用咗兩小時廿五分。政府當局亦都補交咗份文件啦。好多份文件啊！嗱，今朝亦都誒提供咗多份文件畀大家㗎啦。我提醒委員咧喺財委會提出嘅問題咧，必須與議程文件嘅內容直接關係啦。委員亦都避免咧係重複本身或者。

11
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,210
係。

12
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,840
我講 about the the Michael, please go ahead. Thank you.

13
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,920
我提出嘅嗰七個誒設定條件嘅議案嗰個而家個去向係點？佢嘅。

14
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:14,280
啊，你話畀我。Thank you, thank you, Chairman. My name is Michael Cammellengo from KPMG.

15
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:20,150
嗱咁解嘅啫嚇，咁所以咧就係咪有講過啫？我梗係有啦，我喺喺喺電台講㗎嘛，我同三位主席一齊講㗎嘛，即係我啦、阿公務小組啦同埋人事編制一一齊講嘅。但係我當時就係講話等市民去判斷咯，啊就係咁啦。

16
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:56,020
嚟講都係重要，但係對外我只係個比較性啫。對你嚟講打尖上馬嘅睇得佢最重要。唔好爭論呢個時間啦，呢個唔好唔好爭，亦都唔係我嘅我要處理嘅嘢。即係原本都唔係咁興嘅，主席咁聽你咁解釋，你第一你咪真係覺得議員議案唔重要先？我我再講多次，而家呢刻本升嘅大會嚟嘅。

17
00:07:44,360 --> 00:08:02,300
關於姚松炎議員提到咧，我哋誒之前提交過畀公務小組委員會嘅一份文件，有四個嘅例子，究竟係咪誒所謂DBO嘅嗰個嘅方式嚟到去投標嘅咧？我想喺依度咧，邀請我哋嘅營運顧問咧，係就住呢一樣嘢係誒作簡短嘅介紹嘅。好啊，係。

18
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:24,910
民政事務局局長劉江華先生同佢嘅團隊咧，係答大家問題嘅。阿阿江俊宇，係咩問題？規程問題。主席，規程問題。係請講。誒，首先咧，呢個時間咧，本身係應該開緊我哋嘅立法會大會。噉啊，今日咧本身嘅議程咧，有機會就係到我嘅即係議案動物保護法。噉啊，而家我就坐咗喺會議室一開呢個場。

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:44,920
務委員會啦，噉啊曾經喺另一個場合，我哋同大主席瞭解過，究竟其實係你要求喺今日禮拜四開呢個財務委員會啊，定還是即係大主席主動建建議你呢個時間嘅咧？因為我淨係知道咧，如果今日本身冇呢個財務委員會，今晚如果係去到八點鐘嘅話咧，其實係能夠即係有啲意外。

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:03:04,930
我得到討論，我想知道究竟係咪主席向大主席請求喺呢個時間開長務委員會？唔該。我上次都答過咧，我係啊，大主席通知我佢可能會有乜安排嘅啊。噉我梗係支持我呢個建議啦。不過我覺得最重要嘅就係話咧，我哋今日個議程係冇討論呢樣嘢。你對啊大主席有啲咩不滿咧？請你出去咪兜個講。

21
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:24,940
對你不滿真係唔係對大專不滿。我我都講咗啦，我都唔係，我都唔係我提出嘅係嘛？但係但係我舉個贊成啦，佢講嘅，因為我哋真係好多積壓，我都想誒趁呢個機會咧，呼籲大家咧真係善用呢個時間啦，因為我哋仲有好多，譬如東湧嗰個填海咧，都要好耐時間嘅，亦都好多項目咧係排緊隊，我希望大家咧今日儘量就唔好。

22
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:44,950
好嚇，誒，優惠啊，搞嗰啲，即係盡量問問題啦。希望我哋可以即係對政府提出嘅建議有充分嘅討論。我補充一句啫，主席。係好啊，好啊。你曾經講過咧，就話誒大會議案咧冇咗出嚟，議案冇乜用嘅，反而財務委員會呢啲先係重要事。請問呢個係咪屬實嘅咧？我話係邊個重要性咧？等市民考慮咯。

23
00:03:44,950 --> 00:04:04,960
即係例如我哋講緊誒，譬如話誒上次嗰啲誒踩單車啊，或者係嬰兒基金啊，究竟係緊要啲啊？定我哋而家講緊嗰啲誒？咁唔緊要，唔係主席你定義啊！唔係我唔係，我係由市民判斷。市民判斷啊！我我已經學精咗，我唔會縱你哋計，我唔會有我自己嘅判斷，我只係問市民自己判斷。

24
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:40,580
你話你問我，我自己嘅個人嘅感感感覺，梗係我哋啲緊要啲，因為我哋有時間性啊嘛。你哋可以繼續傾㗎嘛。你都嗱，你嗰個，你都就算你唔傾，你唔影響你㗎嘛。其實都係咪？即係你咪遲咗少少啫。但係我哋真真正正有有啲錢，你咁講就越描越黑。唔係我諗，我諗重要過大佬。唔係我我嗱，嗱最緊要噉樣，每樣嘢對你嚟。

25
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:16,550
而家喺度開財務委員會，就係畀你打尖上萬啲三百幾億嘅啟德體育園。阿擴進宇，我講咗好多次，呢啲係啊大主席整體對會議嘅安排。你兩個打龍通，你知邊個打邊個啦？佢又話你，你又話你可以噉樣講嘅，你可以咁講嘅嚇。但係我就唔會唔會同意咯。但係我覺得佢係睇到大家都係為咗做嗰件事咯。係係，請講啊。

26
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:36,560
主席，主席規程問題，我嘅規程問題就係你應該淨係處理規程問題，唔應該處理一啲非規程嘅問題。多謝主席。O K，好啊，阿朱家迪，你有咩講？誒，我唔知我係咪規程問題嘅，其實，但係因為好多都唔係嘅。不過，我我我，問你大家都要講就講啦，冇錯。因為上第一誒兩點嘅第一就係上次咧誒公務小組主席。

27
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:56,570
啊！盧偉國咧咁誒，當喺傾體育員咧，政府掉咗一大堆嘢嘅時候咧，佢就有個機會畀誒局方同埋一個顧問公司解釋嘅。噉就今日我見到都有一堆嘢喺枱面，噉我就想主席你畀啲時間佢哋講少少，介紹下。第二咧就係想問下嗰個誒。

28
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:24,320
你嘅決定有未？唔該，好嗱。首先咧，就我講咗第二條問題先啦。你係提出嗰七條廿一咧，其實咧就而家我仲係考慮緊嘅。咁但係因為你嗰個回應都相當長嘅，同埋咧啲字又好細，其實好似得幾版，其實你都整咗係十幾版嘅。噉我我要花多啲時間去去去睇啦，同埋。

29
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,890
啊。

30
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,310
briefly some background.

31
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,050
那也也跟DBO模式。

32
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,920
for the Moncton Arena example.

33
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,150
in particular, the following queries were noted.

34
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,490
Performance securities and other capital items related to commercial operations.

35
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,260
一 member also raised the comment about the other example we provided, the York Community Stadium.

36
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,280
一 member of this committee subsequently raised queries about three of the four examples.

37
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,560
我會講關於問題，就係關於DBO比較其他項目先。

38
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,300
seeking clarification as to their comparability to the DBO model being adopted for the Kitec Sports Park.

39
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,500
In response, information in relation to four projects was provided to members for their information and consideration.

40
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:52,080
that the procurement model was in fact a design-build-short-term finance and operate approach instead of DBO.

41
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:12,730
During the public works subcommittee sessions, certain members requested information be provided in relation to examples of sports projects in the international markets.

42
00:09:52,830 --> 00:10:02,320
And for the Rogers Place and SunTrust Park examples, that the consortium also contributed a port a portion of the upfront design and construction costs.

43
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:39,450
在 previous sessions of the public works subcommittee, government and its consultants explained that the Kai Tak Sports Park is intended to be procured under the design-build-operate procurement model.

44
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:57,140
第二，ly， that the Kai Tak Sports Park is intended to be funded through government meeting the upfront design and construction costs， and through a private sector consortium who would meet the costs of operations and other upfront costs such as certain identified items of furniture and equipment.

45
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:44,330
係去理解嘅，因為你知你好多論據噉啊，我都要係咪係咪真係好明你講乜咧？我都要再研究下。噉我但係你放心啦，總之我哋喺我哋表決之前咧，你一定會係誒得到有一個裁決，我哋先進入你個項目嘅啊。咁咧就嗱，而家我首先請啊局長，係咪你都可以畀嗰啲專家可以講十分鐘，得唔得？

46
00:06:44,330 --> 00:07:04,340
啊，或者介紹下啊嘛。啊，秘書長，我請啊，秘書長。誒，多謝主席。其實我哋今日咧就提交咗有三份文件嘅，一份咧就係回應上一次財委會誒有多位議員提出嘅提問。咁特別咧就係啊誒梁繼昌議員咧要求我哋有啲關於防貪嘅同埋世貿嘅一啲嘅協定嘅一啲嘅條文點樣監管。

47
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:24,350
有違標嘅情況，咁所以喺文件裏邊咧，我哋都已經係羅列咗。咁因為嗰啲係啲細密嘅條文，我哋唔喺度詳細去講。但係咧，我哋就特別想咧請誒我哋嘅營運顧問咧，就住咧係上一次誒誒阿梁繼昌議員同埋誒朱海迪議員咧都有提出要求，我哋如果六千誒嗰個誒。

48
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:44,360
誒投投資成本嘅嗰個嘅計算方法，我哋做咗一個比較詳盡嘅誒用人工工時嚟到係去誒個計算嘅計出嚟咧。我哋而家最新嘅計法計咗出嚟咧，就係大概一億八千七百萬嘅嗰個嘅投資成本。咁另外亦都有一份文件咧，係一個誒附錄三咧，就係。

49
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
for an identified period of time.

50
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,690
Number one, the procurement model.

51
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,110
我會break this down into two levels.

52
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,110
this is the underlying philosophy of DBO.

53
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,310
但係， funding models for each are different.

54
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,550
as they can be funded in a variety of different ways.

55
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,350
The first level is looking at the procurement model.

56
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,260
第二個層面是看資金模式。

57
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,160
我 now respond to these queries with information that we've prepared.

58
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,280
DVO projects are not defined by their funding structure.

59
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,920
The first is a comparison of the DBO projects and their comparability.

60
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,220
noting that the construction partner exited that consortium during construction.

61
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:58,320
The key feature of the DBO procurement model is that it involves a contract between the public sector, i.e., government.

62
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:07,240
and one single private sector consortium, in which the consortium is granted the rights to design, build and operate the project.

63
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:24,650
and indicated that the government should be mindful of the risks occurring in the Kaitaik Sports Park project of this occurring as a result of using the DBO model.

64
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:31,180
for each of the examples that we have provided, all involve a private sector consortium being responsible for designing, building and operating the project to deliver a total package solution.

65
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,190
Number two.

66
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,610
The difference here.

67
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,580
The funding model for these projects.

68
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,220
The common feature of each example.

69
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,370
Some DBO projects are fully publicly funded.

70
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,330
This is why these examples are comparable to Kai Tak Sports Park.

71
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,340
and others can involve a volume of private sector funding.

72
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,220
for the Moncton Arena project, which is in Canada.

73
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,730
as already said, the funding models for for DBO contracts will be unique for every project.

74
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,360
this is a slight difference to Hong Kong practice, where the typical approach involves interim or milestone payments to the consortium.

75
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:12,860
This example involves government paying 100% of the upfront design and construction costs, as is the case intended for the Kitek Sports Park.

76
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:44,720
因為有 diverse range of funding models that can be adopted for DBO projects, the definition for DBO does not depend on its underlying funding structure.

77
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:25,570
是，這個項目涉及私營部門支付成本期間的建設，然後在建設結束時獲得償還。

78
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:59,250
In terms of the funding models for each of the three models DBO examples raised, the volume of public versus private sector funding varies for each, and I'll briefly summarise those those models.

79
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:55,310
That we have provided is that each is being delivered under a DBO model, because each each approach involves a consortium delivering all aspects of design, construction and operations through a single team.

80
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:18,900
It is important not to confuse the concept of a procurement model with a funding model for a project. Although closely related, these two are separate aspects to be considered in parallel as part of the planning for any infrastructure development project.

81
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,160
and this is in the USA.

82
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,350
through the construction period.

83
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,500
第二個例子是羅傑斯的。

84
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,270
with the private sector funding the remainder.

85
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,830
For DBO， it remains the same.

86
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,870
however，coming back to the key philosophy。

87
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,940
The last example on this point is SunTrust Park in the United States.

88
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,230
although the features of the funding models for Rogers Place and Kai Tak Sports Park have minor variations.

89
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:10,680
在這個例子，政府是負責為籌資大部分的設計和施工成本，約為96%。

90
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:22,900
for the Kai Tak Sports Park, as already mentioned, government is intending to fund the upfront 100% of the upfront design and construction costs.

91
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:56,190
both of these this example and the Kitek Sports Park are all based on a single consortium designing, building and operating the project.

92
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:07,010
In addition, again to reinforce the point, both of these projects involves the delivery of the project through a single team design-build-operate.

93
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:57,310
They are both very similar in that they require the contractor to fund a portion of the capital costs, with the vast majority of the funding for upfront capital costs still resting with government.

94
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:27,110
在這個例子，政府是負責籌資籌集主要部分的設計和建設成本，雖然私營夥伴籌資了一筆相對較大的金額，這比規劃的凱特克斯體育場要多。

95
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:41,900
一higher volume of private sector funding was achievable in this project, because the consortium also includes the team that will ultimately play and be the source of events and revenue for the stadium in this project.

96
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:37,890
與私營部門聯盟提供先期資金，為表現證券、特定項目F＆E及其他開支，與體育場相關。我們估計這些開支在港幣300至400萬之間。

97
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,370
who objected to the decision by the York Stadium planners.

98
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,520
Including construction partners during the construction phase.

99
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,790
因為DBO模型被用，這是第二點，我會講。

100
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,980
however，the underlying procurement model remains the same.

101
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,200
each involves a single consortium designing, building and operating the project.

102
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,070
Indeed, in all construction and major development projects, there is a risk of consortium members exiting.

103
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,000
要 approve plans for a larger cinema alongside the stadium than was originally proposed.

104
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:12,140
在那個項目，ISG撤銷從那個項目，主要係因為施工延誤。

105
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,670
成員 raise 另一個點，關於風險的成員退出項目。

106
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,960
and those delays were caused by an application for judicial review by a local competing cinema operator.

107
00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:01,460
所以那 enables the consortium to take on more responsibility for funding part of the upfront costs and being able to repay those costs through operations.

108
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:25,450
although the funding model models vary for SunTrust and Kitek Sports Park, it is essentially because of the different operating profiles of each project.

109
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:52,170
所以，作為such， the risk profile for the private sector consortium during operations is dramatically lower in this stadium than we have in in the Kintex Sports Park.

110
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:14,790
在 addition， this project also had an adjacent but separate private sector property development opportunity， which allowed the consortium to create additional financial synergies to fund this upfront investment.

111
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:42,910
所以，作為such， it's important to note that the construction partner's decision to withdraw from that particular project was not due to the DBO model， but due to external factors outside of the other external factors.

112
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:05,050
The point was made that we should be mindful of whether the DBO poses this risk, because in the York Community Stadium example, it was noted that during the construction period, the construction partner ISG withdrew from the consortium.

113
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,160
所以，總結。

114
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,250
最後一點。

115
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,520
我 just like to reiterate a few points.

116
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,570
It could be due to any number of factors. For example.

117
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,880
然而，這風險並非solely depend on the procurement model chosen。

118
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,520
Construction cost, difficulties and challenges experienced on a project.

119
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,680
irrespective of the acronym attached to a model or the level of funding provided by government.

120
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:53,090
It would be the responsibility of the consortium to find a suitable replacement, not government.

121
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,150
作為，如果一個建設夥伴要退出聯盟，為凱塔體育場項目。

122
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:24,900
and this these facts apply to every single major development project, not just York Stadium and not just the Kai Tak Sports Park.

123
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:16,250
財務困難，的難度，的實體，外於，的邊界，的，的，項目，或，任何，其他，數，量，的，因素，，，不，相關，於，的，採購，模，型。

124
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:39,230
A DBO is not solely defined as government funding 100% of the upfront costs, just like a DBO is not defined as private sector funding 100% of the upfront costs.

125
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:59,940
The major features of the examples provided is that each project is delivered by a single private sector group responsible for designing, building and operating the project in a total package solution.

126
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:06,970
Indeed, this has also been the case on the York Community Stadium example, where the responsibility for replacing the construction partner rested with the consortium leader, GLL, not the government.

127
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:22,350
是，那，最，新，的，發，展，

128
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:40,840
It's also important to mention that a helpful benefit of the DBO model is that it transfers the responsibility of delivering the facilities, delivering the project, to the private sector consortium that is contracted with government.

129
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,690
啊，局長。

130
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,510
頭先嘅話係咪？

131
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,090
Thank you. That that is the end of that discussion.

132
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,410
and this is the same philosophy for the Kai Tak Sports Park.

133
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,310
crucially, under the DBO model, this responsibility is shifted to the private sector, not government.

134
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,890
好啦，噉我哋恢復翻我哋嗰個提問，阿葉劉淑儀議員四分鐘。誒主席誒，多謝。

135
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:47,880
在商言商啊嘛，噉你哋對於個回報有冇任何話指引啊，或者規定咁嚇？

136
00:21:53,170 --> 00:22:00,200
唔係，我頭先聽到有啲related property development，我冇聽錯或者可唔可以解清楚啲係乜嘢咧？啊！

137
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:39,960
誒Ms.Wylie係嘛？邊位啊？哦，我一日聽咗一橛啫嚇，多謝佢介紹。不過我都仲有啲問題。

138
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:15,780
在terms of the the question raised about the DBO model, shifting the risk of the risk of consortium members exiting, and the responsibility for replacing them.

139
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:32,880
主席就誒裏頭咧就冇一個物業嘅發展嘅，就誒裏頭就係一個大嘅豬場館，另外有個體育館同埋一個嘅運動場。

140
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:16,540
管制個回報幾多percent咧？就會唔會出現領展噉嘅現象，即係判上判啊，判畀人哋啊，咁呢啲噉嘅方法咧嚇？你哋政府會點樣去監察呢個consortium嘅運作？

141
00:20:40,240 --> 00:21:00,250
就係你係由一個private consortium去幫你做BDO啦噉。咁頭先呢位先生聽唔真你嘅名，誒你話你會有物業嘅發展，咪property development啊嘛。噉啊，既然判咗畀你啦，政府有冇好似public utilities咁有利潤？

142
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,540
九百蚊一日。

143
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,560
甚至去到嗰啲咩無障礙設計顧問，七千蚊一日嗰個。

144
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,690
由二零零六年到而家拖咗成十超過十年嘅係政府。

145
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:49,720
其實喺政府咧，就喺二零零九年嗰陣時估個造價咧，只係一百八十億。

146
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,420
誒分拆啊、外判啊、判上判啊噉，第日你中咗標嗰啲會唔會都可以噉啊？

147
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:58,810
噉就我哋每一次講話，即係要問多啲咧，政府就係你千祈唔好阻延我，你阻延我咧，你又要增加幾多億？

148
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:43,620
即係咁離譜一個，我都未見過政府要打本畀人做呢一個行，即係一個投標，可以去到噉，可以去到咁盡。

149
00:24:51,140 --> 00:25:01,470
負責人每日嗰個加埋嗰個費用一萬七千五，任何你數得到出嚟嗰啲所謂專家咧，係講緊廿幾萬一個月嘅七千蚊一日。

150
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:33,650
即係其實，如果你噉樣作呢啲數咧，唔使一億八，即係唔止一億八，你作夠三億六五萬五億四都得嘅。你下次咧，我教嗰啲顧問作多啲，作多啲人。

151
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:20,660
誒工底安全環境主任七千蚊一日，唯一咧就係有個叫最平人工咧，就如果佢喺香港，我真係睇到好少數會講明要請香港人咧，本地人就個營運顧問咧就四千。

152
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:50,860
主席啊，就我都係好少見到啲招標係咁混帳，主席。因為事實上咧，就頭先我聽到個顧問嗰啲嘅計嗰啲數咧，即係都令我都覺得都係幾都幾離譜下嘅。佢嗰個。

153
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:53,170
誒以往咧，曾經有一個嘅起初有一個規劃咧，就係有個酒店喺入邊嘅。不過而家咧就我哋新嘅一個設計咧，我哋將呢個酒店咧係即係分開去處理。咁所以我哋純粹喺入邊係有一啲嘅，即係呢啲嘅場地。當然再再加埋即係零售啊、餐飲啊，即係呢啲嘅。

154
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:21,000
行業嗰次差唔多想解主席或者簡單講咧，頭先誒我哋嘅顧問KPMG咧，佢哋咧就係講緊誒上一次姚崇賢議員提出有四個咧喺世界上我哋揾到都係用緊DBO模式嘅一啲嘅例子，噉係唔係講緊我哋香港呢個嘅體體議員，係講緊喺外國有一呢個例子裏邊因為。

155
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:41,010
係有一啲物業嘅配套，以致嗰個嘅承辦商願意付出一啲嘅誒建築費用咁解嘅啫。喺我哋呢個例子就冇誒呢啲嘅誒由承辦商擁有嘅一啲嘅物業嘅嚇，即係唔會再用物業嚟養呢個project，唔會咁㗎啦嚇。噉啊噉，你做承辦商嘅有得賺錢做㗎，係嘛噉。

156
00:22:48,370 --> 00:23:08,380
啊，貝司長主席，其實我哋今次係透過一個招標嘅形式嘅，當然即係我哋會付出嗰個嘅建築設計費用啦。但係實際上每一個成誒投標者，佢會願意同政府分幾多嘅誒呢一個嘅利潤咧，就會喺個透過招標嘅過程咧，佢哋係去誒投標。咁誒，我哋會有唔同嘅評分。

157
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:28,390
嘅部分嘅，譬如話誒，頭先提到誒設計建造越價錢越低，咁當然佢攞嘅分係越高啦。但係誒倒翻轉，如果同政府去分賬或者係畀嗰個誒定額嘅罰誒定額嘅款項咧，越高咧，噉佢亦都會攞到個分係越高嘅。咁所以係喺嗰個所謂個price envelope嗰度咧，係有幾個評分嘅準則嘅。

158
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:48,400
咁所以，我哋就唔會定咗話佢最多可以分幾多，但係我哋就會透過呢個投標嘅過程咧，嚟到係去誒睇下邊一個係最對政府個個誒誒，即係成個package最好噉樣樣。噉你你知就領展就個例子啦，即係佢誒攞咗啲誒公共屋邨嘅物業管理，噉佢。

159
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:14,910
係主席誒，我哋同領展一個最大嘅唔同咧，就係誒，我哋冇賣到我哋嘅物業出去嘅。呢一個嘅成個啟德體育園係屬於政府擁有，佢只係我哋一個嘅承辦商，即係一個contractor。咁承辦商喺合約嘅期間，佢當然會誒負責去營運啦。但係喺個合約完結嘅時候，呢一個嘅體育園仍然係屬於政府。

160
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:34,920
所有如中間，如果承辦商喺表現上邊係不濟，或者係有啲我哋誒係唔滿意，要中斷合約嘅咧，呢個體育員嘅擁有權益仍然都係屬於政府。我哋唔會畀佢去判上判，或者係去由佢去決定畀邊個去營運嘅，即係佢個財誒佢個集團係噉樣樣咧，就係噉樣樣。我哋係一個合約嚟嘅。多謝我話郭家麒議員四分鐘。

161
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,010
大三百幾億。

162
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,220
呢個並非一個騙局。

163
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,100
亦都咧，亦都唔係一個。

164
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,490
即係攻擊咧，我覺得係好唔公道嘅。

165
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,200
收錢咧都唔少嘅，二零二五年咧嗰個。

166
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,440
啊，局長，主席就郭議員呢一個嘅。

167
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:44,040
喺度咧就可以攞三百幾億嘅資金，仲要一年啊！其實一年都唔止七億啊！

168
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,850
你睇翻佢嗰啲營運嗰啲數字咧，就真係睇咗都係嗰一陣眼火爆。

169
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:51,700
究竟你呢一啲噉嘅成個體育園區，其實都係一個大騙局嚟嘅，係嘛？即係你攞個體育園區為名咧。

170
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:15,950
嗰啲噉嘅體育活動啊，一連三十日嗰啲，可能我哋過長啦，因為有個名目可以即係考慮下都好。

171
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:15,250
跟住擺上財委會一定要過，仲要限時限刻減減咗嗰個大會就要過呢一啲嘢，政府唔需要負責任。

172
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:53,590
啊！呢個估計咧，餐飲咧就有二億六千一百萬，停車場收入都有五億四千九百萬。其實呢啲先至係肉嚟嘅。

173
00:27:52,030 --> 00:28:04,870
即係始終我相信都係有啲本地啊外資嘅財權咧，會食呢嚿肥豬肉嘅。嗰個肥豬肉唔止一啖嘅，因為仲可以繼續食，每年食落去。政府點解可以咁卑鄙做一啲噉嘅嘢？

174
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:06,790
即係你一路咧就話畀人聽咧，就係睇啟德體育園區。事實上嘅先食三百一十九億嘅肉，然後咧每年咧就去睇呢度講緊係分別二億六千一百萬同埋五億幾。

175
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:36,480
九三百一十八億，嗰個主場館幾年後一連三十日都唔係場場係嗰啲嘅體育活動嚟嘅。其實攞體育活動為名咧，就係呃好多香港人。

176
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:38,300
嗰啲係香港人啲血汗錢嚟嘅，即係政府點會做到係咁離譜？又嗰個嗯，又出埋錢打埋本，又攞三百幾億，因為佢唯一咧喺個文件度，佢攞出嚟嘅錢咧就係兩億放落去，七億咧就冇公司嗰個嗯擔保，即係攞九億放低喺。

177
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,550
都係等呢一刻。

178
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,770
投資啦。

179
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,460
大白象啦～

180
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,810
即係所謂。

181
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,010
如果阿郭瑩講責任咧？

182
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,050
呢三百億元嘅投。

183
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,270
其實係體育界係多年嚟嘅要求。

184
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,130
政府嘅責任的而且確係長期咧，係規劃咗呢個。

185
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,950
營運參與者最終可能有啲誒 rebate 畀翻佢哋，一個六千萬咁先算嘅。

186
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,970
體育界搞呢個飲食嘅朋友咧，有啲坐喺上高而家都等咗十幾年。

187
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:55,770
我哋嘅責任都交上嚟，拖咗十年。如果去到呢一刻，而家責任就喺立法會議員身上啦。希望你能夠通過。

188
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:21,400
呢個DBO咧都係屬於一個新思維嘅，但係問題啲新思維帶咗出嚟之後咧，就有啲爭議性咧，就話點解要嗰啲誒？

189
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:13,980
再提出而家呢個誒DBO嘅模式，有冇考慮過噉樣咧？即係用傳統先，傳統唔得嘅先用呢個新嘅模式噉。咁呢個第一個問題，第二個問題就係話。

190
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:42,060
噉啊！我想問局長咧，有冇評估過？如果你不開始就用呢種方法，係咪就代表冇呢啲噉嘅誒財團去投標？

191
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:11,560
即係咁離譜嘅嘢，你拖十年又得，我哋問多兩句都唔得。好啊，時間夠啦，阿鐘國斌餘五分鐘。多多謝主席。誒，我哋成日話政府應該揾啲新嘅思維去處理啲事誒事件啦。噉我覺得今次咧。

192
00:29:42,520 --> 00:30:02,530
認購呢個噉嘅項目，如果真係做咗呢一即係傳統嗰種之後咧，但係嗰位真係冇喎，冇人參與，因為個投資太大喎。我誒投資喺呢度，淨係投標輸咗得唔到，我可能要付出成個億嘅成本，咁先再。

193
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,560
炒咗佢咧！

194
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,340
誒。

195
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,800
話攞呢個新嘅構思出嚟啦，噉。

196
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,350
誒，如果嗰個財團得到，

197
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:04,110
出咗去投標，冇人投啦，先至出呢個題案有因，佢可能就係問呢個問題。

198
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:13,920
唔係，局長，我我我都係用翻你而家噉嘅構思，但係唔需要有個rebate畀佢先嘅。

199
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:47,310
啊，局長，於是就啊，多謝啊，鐘園呢兩個問題。其實呢兩個問題咧，都係互相有關連嘅。

200
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:11,840
我哋都答過咧，就係話，若果用呢個方法咧，必定出現咧，就係第一次一定冇人投票，佢就等你咯。

201
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:58,550
至於中二跟住問嗰個問題咧，就係提案有因，即係話可唔可以先係傳統嗰兩冇提案有因。

202
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:50,420
佢真係由而家開始，我哋開始係投標啦。佢一定係要做足一個嘅規劃，同埋咧係應到我哋嘅指標先至得。如果應唔到指標嘅話咧，我哋有權咧係中止佢合約嘅。咁所以呢個係第一個問題。

203
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:38,710
建建建成咗之後去營運，佢係咩情況之下你哋會攞翻？如果做得唔好，你真係好似遊輪碼頭噉，嘢成劈渣咁劈咗喺度。嗰個營運者嘅問題，我覺得係完全係個營運者問題。咁但係你又唔炒佢喎？咁咩情況之下咧？如果呢個體育園區佢攞咗翻嚟，但係營運得唔理想，係咩情況之下可以？

204
00:30:47,600 --> 00:31:07,610
個原因咧就係我哋過往鑑於，若果係將佢分開嘅話，誒設計還設計，建造還建造，然後咧就做好曬啦，然後先揾一個營運者入場嘅話咧，往往就會出現好多問題，大家配套唔到，大家係即係左手唔知右手。

205
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:35,320
誒冇冇人參與啦，或者真係冇人制啦，你先去用新思維啊，畀埋rebase佢。明誒，中議員咧，其實就將兩個概念應該要講埋兩個概念。第一個概念你淨係講DBO嘛，所以我而家就回應緊DBO呢個問題。點解要有DBO咧？就正正係剛才你淨係有第二個問題個牽引咧，若嗰。

206
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:32,130
咁所以咧，我哋不會考慮呢一個方法。噉啊，主席，梗係第一次，噉你唔好話畀人知有第二樣嘢出現啦，係咪？一話咗，梗係唔制嘅，個個都會等你第二樣出籠出籠啊嘛！咁即係第一次嗰陣時咧，你直頭唔講，有呢個噉嘅誘因，睇下有冇人去即係用傳統方法投標。如果冇嘅，你先哦，原來冇嘅，噉我。

207
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:56,760
我哋嚟到立法會咧，一定要好坦誠嘅，主席。誒，我哋應該點做法？真係好公開透明咯。咁所以而家真係講咗呢個情況。誒，亦都唔會話我哋先出一樣嘢，然後再翻去第二樣嘢。我哋並不會咁做。亦都係我覺得誒，呢個唐有恩咧，上一次我哋都係即係都講解得比較清楚。

208
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:16,770
亦都有佢一定嘅好處。個好處咧就係誒，第一佢可以咧係更加係誒用佢嘅專才，係用多啲嘅方法誒諗多啲嘅建議去投呢個標。第二嚟講咧，佢本身咧亦都可以咧，我哋誒就算係有輸咗，嗱而家呢個嘅方法。

209
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,220
主席。

210
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,760
誒最後咧。

211
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,230
就係牟利嘅個。

212
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,070
即係唔係好興香嘅啫？呢個呢呢個行業。

213
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,760
好，阿梁國雄議員四分鐘。

214
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,710
How can you tell us there will be no J R at all?

215
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,100
我我想問問你，你點樣保證將來冇車油？

216
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,300
係咪先？即係佢會諗到種方法。

217
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,680
咁梗係啦！我而家就問你，你點解要用呢一個方法啊？嘛？

218
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,900
咁人哋去嗱，譬如間舉個例噉樣，噉你點知將來冇呢一個？

219
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,130
即係顧問公司，而家係顧問公司嘅成立係咩咧？

220
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:10,810
係令到咧個嗰個多啲生意嘅機會啦。如果唔係，佢顧乜鬼民啦？老實講。

221
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:35,400
噉你話喂呢個誒喺work嗰度咧，就唔係因為呢一樣嘢搞搞出事嘅。

222
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:23,840
嗱，如果你話誒你，我就係聽到嗰位醫生講話，哦，其實咧呢個世界咧，你點樣做咧都會有流動嘅。

223
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:47,080
咧，我覺得喺呢次嚟講，政協啊、中議員嚟講咧，即係都講咗咧，呢個係一個新嘅思維、新嘅做法。我哋希望咧能夠達到一個新嘅好嘅效果出嚟嘅。

224
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:36,780
或者就贏嗰個，我哋就唔會畀佢嘅。但係輸嗰兩家咧，我哋就會可以攞到佢一啲嘅知知識產權。咁所以嚟講咧，就誒其實贏嗰個咧唔一定係十全十美嘅，輸嗰兩個咧亦都唔一定係完全係不可行嘅。咁所以咧，如果有提引有因咧，我哋會將佢一啲最好嘅元素咧，係能夠複合。

225
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,520
係。

226
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,170
有。

227
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,400
主席。

228
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,720
你想去答？

229
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,270
我成日做嘅。

230
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,010
咁如果私有化咁點啊？

231
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,590
not not to repeat what happened in York.

232
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,740
我真係聽到火都滾啦！你以為我哋香港冇私家科客嘅？

233
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,060
即係會發生咯，因為攞咗百六千萬嘅揞口費啊嘛～

234
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:49,980
我攞我攞咗你個先產權用唔用都好，噉你咪即係一八去防止個J R嘅黑即係。

235
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,190
你點知人哋冇去冇去超級複合嚟啊？就因為你咁做先得超級複合啊嘛！你搞咁多嘢，想講咩嘅？所以好複雜。

236
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:42,260
係咪噉嘅意思啊？點點解有億八？我而家先明，就係話你輸咗都唔緊要，畀六畀翻六千萬你，咁又唔係買曬你成個知識產權。

237
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:51,790
咁唔答啊？你咪上去答啊！係我係你，每次答你答下，答下你又插入嚟得啦嚇。我係搞停曬口，你唔係啊？話阿陳茂、陳建波，你經常都唔同㗎，你好難掌握㗎，你啲你啲問嘅方技巧。阿阿局長。

238
00:35:52,090 --> 00:36:12,100
即係就，如果問到司法覆核問題，可能我會誒誒，應該要答呢個問題。就並非誒顧問誒。其實咧，我哋做呢個嘅項目咧，基本上都係有好長嘅規劃，亦都有一個嘅公眾諮詢，亦都係吸納咗體育界不少嘅朋友嘅意見。

239
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:32,110
誒，先至去到而家呢一個嘅最後一個噉嘅議出嚟。主席，佢啊，我有聽㗎。佢而家唔係我，佢啲民間嚟收服佢，佢只嗰啲做生意嗰啲人先嚟收服佢啊嘛，係咪？即係話佢，我你噉樣唔啱嘅，噉樣做唔啱嘅。噉你而家畀三個人啊，所以你就可能就係咁啦。畀億百揞口費，就以後就唔會有收入複合噉啊。

240
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:15,660
主席，我可唔可以容許我答埋先啊？我話你聽佢問咗個問題，我哋先答埋先。即係我哋都係一路按部就班咧，係誒喺經過民政事務委員會公務小組，而家嚟到呢個財務委員會。誒，假設誒，議員當然係可以提好多嘅問題同埋意見。唔係，但係我哋都係唔使佢講就。

241
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,900
阿局長。

242
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,950
係，開翻個麥畀阿尹議員。

243
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,400
估算個有關收收入係幾多嘅？

244
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,380
即係而家，我先知道點解畀億八。

245
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,420
啊！開翻個麥畀阿尹兆堅議員。

246
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,710
喂喂，誒主席有啦，而家滅咗聲一陣嘅。

247
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,240
有咩有咩嘢特別？即係佢，你係你係你嗰個就係。

248
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,130
design、build、and operate啊嘛，噉佢design咗嘅嘢，佢點會攞其他嘢入去啫？

249
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,580
好，兩樣時間夠啦，你再撳啦嚇，如果再問人，傻嘅都諗到啦。尹兆堅議員四分鐘。

250
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:39,010
就算數，其實你聽落已經知道係唔唔啱㗎，因為你攞個知識產權做咩啫？

251
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:32,200
我問嘅係佢哋自己做生意之間去JL，我我唔去JL，佢啲人去JL佢㗎嘛？噉我而家問就係嗰一億八銀，嗰一億一億八千萬就係阻止佢人哋JL攞咗一百一萬八誒嗰嗰嗰六億。

252
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:35,050
噉就誒，我上次問個問題啊，阿局長未答我嘅。我問誒兩樣嘢，就係第一嗰個酒店啊，因為佢下一期有個酒店㗎嘛。如果佢個誒而家個嗰個誒今次成個計劃個理念啊，就係話成lock個係好嘅，有規模嘅等等啦，係正話喺度。

253
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:55,060
誒答我哋同事嗰一大堆理由啦，點解嗰個酒店又要額外剁開嚟做咧？呢個第一個佢佢未答我嘅。第二個就係我想問佢誒，根據文件所講咧，入邊係有一啲嘅誒餐飲啊、誒零售等等嘅項目㗎嘛，咁嗰個收益應該就係成萬者㗎啦。我就問佢有冇？

254
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:20,150
啊，秘書長，我哋最初嘅時候咧，係將酒店同埋一個辦公大樓咧，擺咗喺啟德體育園嗰個嘅計劃裏邊，係都都係以公堂嚟到去營誒誒嚟到去興建。咁但係後嚟咧，我哋都同誒其他政策局討論咗之後咧，覺得酒店同埋辦公室咧，其實係唔需要用公堂嚟到去資。

255
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:40,160
支付嘅係可以透過一個獨立嘅賣地嘅方式咧，嚟到係去誒揾一個承辦商係去興建噉，所以我哋係將佢抽咗出嚟，就唔再喺呢一個嘅啟德體育園嗰個項目裏邊。咁至於頭先阿尹議員問到嗰個餐飲零售咧，其實咧就主要喺個室內嗰個嘅誒體育館下邊嘅誒，大概有六。

256
00:39:40,160 --> 00:40:00,170
萬平方米到咁咧，我哋就會係要求咧個承包商佢投標嘅時候咧，就係提出佢同政府點樣樣去分賬。咁亦都因為議員要求咧，我哋咧就會加入咧要求佢係要有一個嘅固定嘅誒所謂fixed payment，除咗係一個誒包底，同埋亦都要有一個分賬。咁所以兩方面咧都係同政府會有一個分誒分分賬嘅。

257
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:08,400
嚇，相對抽成嗰個分數咧，係會可能個比重會低一啲嘅。咁呢個都係由翻投標者去提出。明白，主席。但係咁有個問題啦，就係。

258
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:19,620
誒呢個係理想狀態啦，我都希望佢做得好啊。但係佢有機會係達唔到標㗎嘛？管理不善又好，包底費都畀唔起percentage又又 fulfil唔到，咁點算啊？

259
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:11,440
我亦會有點樣安排會擺喺呢度？會唔會誒喺取於此用於此咧？喺推動翻誒體育園區或者體育項目嘅推廣嘅啊，李司長。

260
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:20,180
噉我哋而家計算咗頭五年咧，去到譬如話營運期比較穩定嘅時候，二零二六年咧，誒估計咧就喺嗰個嘅誒淨嘅盈餘嗰度咧，大概係會有二億九千萬到嘅。咁呢個就係未同政府分賬，但係咧就要睇下嗰個承包商佢喺個標書裏邊提出同政府點樣分發。譬如話係二誒兩。

261
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:40,190
兩成、八成或者三成、七成噉樣，噉就到時睇下個最終投標成功投標嗰個咧點樣樣誒提出同政府去分啦。O.K.，即係話啊，主席，即係話嗰個誒分賬個百分比未定啦，就視乎標書啦。標書。咁但係包底費咧，包底費政府有冇期望啊？主席。因為你都都唔係少錢啊，就就咁講。嚇！包底費咧，其實誒，我哋喺。

262
00:40:40,190 --> 00:41:00,200
上一次回答誒呢一個嘅財委會嘅文件度咧都講咗啦，兩個部分咧都要需要由呢個投標者提出嘅。咁亦都因應誒田北辰議員咧，佢提到咧話希望包底咧係高過呢一個嘅分賬嘅比例，我哋會向中央投標委員會提議咧，就係話大家喺個計分評分嘅時候咧，包底如果越高咧，佢攞到嘅分數咧係會越高嘅。

263
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:40,250
個個操作係點啊？主席，誒當然啦，即係最終係點樣分咧，就睇下嗰個嘅營運佢個誒嗰年攞到幾多賺到幾多錢啦，個營業係點樣樣。但係我哋喺嗰個嘅合約裏邊咧，都會有一啲嘅指標嘅，包括咧同政府分賬，即係佢應承咗嘅係咪能夠做到嗰個嘅包底費畀到咧？如果

264
00:41:40,250 --> 00:42:00,260
包畀唔到嘅呢個，亦都係滿足唔到嗰個主要營運指標嘅其中一樣。咁如果我哋綜合嚟睇咧，整體嗰個嘅誒承辦商係喺多方面都達唔到指標咧，我哋可能會係引用一啲罰款嘅機制啦，又或者咧係可能最差嘅情況咧係會同佢終止合約嘅。O.K. 如果做到咧，我想問嗰個收益咧，政府嘅收

265
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:31,890
誒主席，我哋一向咧就喺政府嚟講咧，收入同埋開支咧都係分開嘅。咁所以，我哋嘅收入咧都係入翻庫房嘅，即係入翻嗰個嘅general revenue account裏邊嘅。咁但係當然，我哋支出咧會有另外一啲使費，就係使喺體育發展方面。劉少禮議員五分鐘係多謝主席。噉我必須重申啦，其實我係支持。

266
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:51,900
體育項目嘅一路以嚟咧，我都係只係想確保咧，即係呢一個體育園嘅營運咧，係能夠做得好啲。我係擔心呢一種營運方法咧，係會浪費公帑之餘咧，未必做到我哋真正嘅目的。咁即係啱啱政府就補充咗文件啦，係即係顧問報告嘅文件，就即係一路以嚟個討論似乎係有啲誤導嘅，而家就。

267
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:11,910
似乎釐清啦，即係D B O咧，就只係講緊咧，就係同一個集團去負責呢三個項目，而唔係講緊融資。咁所以咧，我就好想即係瞭解一下。咁既然係咁咧，點解政府一路都覺得係我哋自己要畀曬嗰一筆錢嘅咧？點解我哋唔去做即係中間有一個融資，咁而令到呢個即係？

268
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:31,920
誒興建嘅超支又好啊，或者一啲風險又好，即係可以去分擔到風險咧。咁誒，首先我想即係誒，局長答我呢個問題先。好啊，局長。跟住就誒，好高興聽到話劉翠麗議員咧，其實都大家其實都好一致嘅，即係對於嗰個將來個營運得好咧，呢個係好重要。咁至於咧，就而家呢？

269
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:51,930
個三百誒一十九億元嘅一個嘅誒款項咧，誒我哋係作為政府嘅一個嘅基建開支一個投資嚟嘅。我哋對於體育運動咧，其實誒非常之著緊，亦都好希望咧透過呢個硬件嘅興建，加埋將來十八個區裏頭。

270
00:43:51,930 --> 00:44:11,940
嘅二百億元嘅投資喺各項嘅康體活動啦，誒康體嘅硬件設施咧，總共五百億元。我哋都希望係政府係全資去做呢個投資，全力去支持呢個體育運動。咁呢個咧就希望阿阿劉小麗議員都能夠支持呢一點。唔係主席，我係問緊佢咧喺興建嘅。

271
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:31,950
過程入邊點解唔令到即係呢個承包商都係係有一啲投資落去去分擔風險咧？因為我哋見到幾個外國嘅案例都係噉樣做啊嘛。哦，主席其實佢就唔係話完全係誒冇風險嘅個原因咧，就係佢要承擔喺未來嗰二十年。

272
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:51,960
嗰個嘅即係營運嘅運作係佢要係有一個嘅自負盈虧喺度，咁所以講咧，若果佢係即係遇到啲風險咧，佢係要承擔。主席、局長都唔係答緊我個問題嘅，因為頭先即係我哋多次會議咧，就即使姚崇賢議員都講過，在嗰個風險，如果只喺營運嗰度咧，其實喺個承建同埋設計過。

273
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,820
啊，秘書長。

274
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,430
咩？如果係噉。

275
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:57,970
插嘴啫，即係誒誒，你講嘅係一個percent，噉你頭先都話佢都可以畀到五個percent啊嘛，喺呢一度對佢嚟講就係一個好大嘅差別咯。

276
00:45:51,990 --> 00:46:08,920
機構去負擔嗰個模式咧，其實成個計劃係唔所謂唔唔viable嘅，即係唔唔可能生存到。咁所以最終政府咧決定係用公務工程呢一個方法咧嚟到係去設計誒負責個設計同埋興建嘅費用，但係就需要私營機構咧係去承擔嗰個營運嘅費用嘅。

277
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:40,260
主席，我哋都解釋過啦。誒，成個體育園咧係一個即係全面嘅，係一個希望有活力嘅體育園區。我哋唔想咧用一個政府嘅模式咧嚟到去營運呢個體育園，希望咧能夠亦透過承辦商佢哋喺商業或者市場推廣方面有經驗，嚟到令到成個體育園咧係更有活力咁去營運嘅。

278
00:44:51,960 --> 00:45:11,970
過程入邊，佢已經賺盡咗你啲錢。佢個風險唔係好大，所以我問緊嘅咧，其實係喺個承建嘅過程入邊，究竟我哋點樣去轉移呢個風險啊？誒，主席或者我作少少補充，其實我哋喺公務小組委員會度咧，都畀咗九個唔同嘅採購模式畀議員去參參考嘅。其中咧，我哋其實喺早階段咧，都曾經咧係研。

279
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:31,980
研究過咧，所謂要求嗰個嘅誒投標者咧，係負擔一部分嗰個建築費。但係當我哋去計完之後咧，由於呢個啟德體育園咧係一個其實係一個社會嘅基建嘅設施嚟嘅，當中有好多咧誒，除咗嗰個主場館同埋餐飲零售之外咧，全部都係一啲唔賺錢嘅一啲嘅誒設施，包括八公頃嘅公共空間同埋誒。

280
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:51,990
誒誒室內運動場同埋呢個誒誒誒公眾運動場，咁所以咧，如果就算要呢一個私人機構咧，佢負擔咧，其實佢最多咧，我哋計算出嚟咧，都係成個項目嘅百分之五左右嘅啫。政府仍然咧係要負擔設計興建費用嘅百分之九十五嘅。咁所以用一個合資嘅模式，或者用一個所謂完全由私人。

281
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:29,480
主席，我唔係好聽得明白點解咧？即係誒秘書長會認為咧誒嗰個誒承造商佢自己去誒畀五個percent出嚟嘅話係一個唔可行嘅方法，因為呢一個就喺個興建嘅過程入邊，佢自己都要去確保佢自己嘅財政係穩健，而令到嗰個興建嘅風險唔好噉。

282
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:49,490
高嘛，我想佢詳細解釋下。啊，秘書長，係主席，其實而家個承建商咧唔係一毫子都唔使畀嘅。正如我哋喺文件裏邊都提過咧，佢係要upfront咧係要畀三至四億嗰個開拔嘅費用，因為所有嘅嗰啲嘅內部嘅裝修啊、誒營運嘅一啲零售餐飲嘅設施咧都要佢負責。嗱，因為時間有限，我喺呢度插一。

283
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:18,260
主席，我哋咧，其實咧，好希望咧，呢一個體育園咧係完全屬於政府擁有嘅，所以我哋咧就寧願咧係畀埋嗰三至四個percent咧，我哋想擁有成個體育園嘅擁有權，唔想用一個合資嘅模式，讓咗呢一個嘅承辦商。咁點解唔喺成唔唔喺operation上面喺營運上，我哋都去負責營運？

284
00:47:40,540 --> 00:48:00,550
好，阿陸仲洪議員五分鐘。誒，多謝主席。噉啊，我哋工聯會一直咧都係十分支持體育嘅發展嘅，不論係體育嘅政策啊，或者體育嘅硬件啊，無論係地區人士嘅參與咧，精英運動員需要嘅場地，或者係誒一啲運動嘅產業化、職業化。

285
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:20,560
咁其實佢都係需要有一啲咧優質同埋大型嘅場地去配合嘅，都有一啲嘅誒文化嘅節目嚇，誒一啲音樂會嘅節目需要一啲咧大嘅場館。而家我哋香港嘅場館咧都係落後嘅。噉我諗個需求咧係客觀存在嘅，絕大多數市民咧都係會支持嘅。但我想問兩個問。

286
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:40,570
第一個咧就係政府喺通過咗呢個誒啟德體育園嘅計劃之後，其實係必須咧要有一個制定一個一個更加整全嘅體育發展政策，特別係支持一啲咧係精英運動員同埋專業運動員。我點解講話？

287
00:48:40,570 --> 00:49:00,580
精英同專業咧，因為香港而家有一個專業誒嘅唔係精英運動員嘅一個制度啦。但係有一啲咧係非精英運動員，但係佢專業運動員例如足球啊、籃球，有更加完善嘅配套同支持佢哋去發展。噉我諗呢樣嘢係需要嘅。如果唔係，將來咧呢個平台起好咗啦，咁但係咧未有足。

288
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:20,590
夠嘅體育嘅產業去支持咧，咁其實可能咧個效果咪能夠最大嘅成效。咁除咗之外咧，就誒亦都係關注咧嗰個誒營運嘅模式。當然啦，唔同嘅營運模式咧都有佢嘅好處同唔好處。無論係即係傳統嘅政府即係一包到底。

289
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:36,520
裏邊嘅。

290
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,530
好，阿馬逢國議員。

291
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:23,490
啊！誒一齊嗰個嘅叫做誒聯絡聯合嘅營運嗰個監察委員會嗰度咧，我哋會處理嘅。

292
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:14,560
誒，其當中就話類似有提一啲嘅項目咧，我哋而家係碰到一個問題咧，就係場地不夠。咁所以講，若果能夠喺場地上高都能夠咧係大力去支援佢哋咧，我相信咧係會有幫助嘅。

293
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:40,600
嘅形式嚇嘅形式就可能大家好好安心、好放心啦。但係可能個公堂嘅支出就會更加大。過去即係其他嘅民康設施咧，就算唔計個興建成本咧，淨係個營運成本咧，政府都係要補貼嘅，即係好難喺個門票啊，或者喺嗰個租金收入嗰度咧抵消到嘅。呢個大家知道。

294
00:49:40,630 --> 00:50:00,640
咁亦都譬如啊啊好誒有啲好似一啲嘅基建噉樣，譬如BOT嘅制度，可能咁令到佢啊加價就好似我哋一啲誒隧道啊加價，你啊監管唔到佢啊，又一啲問題。咁而家呢種嘅DPO嘅制度，噉我想問啦，即係政府講咗好多好處咧，但有幾點咧我都～

295
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:20,650
係繼續關注第一點咧，就係誒政府雖然喺之前都講過話啊，啲場地收費咧一定係會同其他康文署嘅場地收費係相約嘅，唔會太貴嘅嗱。呢個相約嘅意思咧係係咪會寫明係一個合約嘅條款，同埋喺個協議裏邊咧同個營。

296
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:40,660
辦所呢個我覺得係必須要，因為呢個場地咧亦都係好多咧地區人士啊市民會使用嘅場地太貴咧，係令到市民咧都有望而卻步嘅。第二個咧就係嗰個呢個營辦商咧，即係有人認為形容哇係一個大肥肉啊，億人啊噉樣。嗱呢個世界咧冇錢畀人賺咧就冇人。

297
00:50:40,660 --> 00:51:00,670
做嘅，但係謀取暴利咧，市民亦都睇唔過眼咧，因為呢個咧係一個公共基建嘅投資。咁政府有冇一個對呢個營辦商要可能要設一個盈利嘅上限咧？或者係佢嗰個誒營運嘅模式要作一啲監管咧？嗱，譬如佢裏邊有一啲嘅食市啊，同埋商場嘅部分嘅，咁當然。

298
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:20,680
用呢個補貼都係一個好嘅方法嚟嘅，但係擔唔擔心？可能個商場咧，譬如可能嗰一排，即係我相信未必一定會翻翻嗰種模式啦。喂啊，又係興翻全部都係奶粉、誒誒藥房同埋金鋪，噉啊全部咧就就走曬入去，變咗好似一個Outlet噉樣，即係即係專賣呢啲噉嘅嘢，即係會形成一種咁咁古怪嘅情況。

299
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:40,690
講咧，因為可能個營辦商追逐個利潤，咁所以我諗政府咧喺嗰個營辦商嗰個，即係佢雖然係一個承包制，但係要一定嘅話事權同埋咧去參與佢，同埋點樣去管制有一個合理嘅利潤喺度咧？唔該，主席。好啊，阿局長。亦就誒第二個部分咧，啊上邊可以答。至於第一部分咧，就誒。

300
00:51:40,690 --> 00:52:00,700
議員關心嗰個將來嗰個體育誒政策嘅發展咧，其實我哋都強調咧，就個城市化、精英化同埋誒普及化。而家係正正咧，就係要提升咧，就呢個城市化嘅場地，呢個係重要嘅。誒，再加上我哋已經講喺地區嘅一啲嘅普及化嘅設施。

301
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:49,910
嘅。

302
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,040
可能遠遠係有價值嘅。

303
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,200
空間去去進行體育運動，鍛鍊身體。

304
00:54:50,280 --> 00:55:04,860
咁至於即係嗰個園區咧，即係今日誒財委會啦，大家都好關注嗰個費用。噉我自己都好關注嘅，都認為即係而家政府嗰個數字可能會係稍為偏貴。噉，但我我亦都覺得咧，即係政府喺過去誒公務小組嘅時候，已經解答咗好多個問題。

305
00:56:47,360 --> 00:57:03,450
有百分之二十所啦，係反對。咁呢個數字都係好清楚嘅。咁所以我好希望咧，即係今日都係要表達業界嘅意見。誒，就係點樣可以盡快，即係政府係落實，我哋財委會盡快係通過，就唔好淨係講咧，即係話我哋大家都係支持體育運動噉樣。

306
00:57:43,800 --> 00:58:02,640
程序咧係能夠攞到咧誒合理嘅數目嘅具競爭性嘅標書嘅，咁但係當然如果去到一個嘅情況係都冇嘅時候咧，可能我哋就要再考慮有冇其他嘅方式，可能喺個調教上面，即係個標個個誒投標嗰個內容嘅條件等等咧，要一啲嘅調教嘅。好，阿朱凱迪議員五分鐘。

307
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:35,930
係，係有冇補充個收費營運嗰度啊？嚇，收費營運點啊？誒，嗱，主席嗰個嘅收費咧，我哋喺多次嘅文件都講咗咧。誒，嗰啲公共嘅體育設施咧，個收費一定係同康文處係相約。咁當然有啲設施康文處而家冇營運嘅咧，我哋都會參考啲社會上面嘅一啲N G O提供嘅設施嘅收費。呢個會係寫喺嗰個嘅合約裏。

308
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:57,020
嗰個利潤上限會唔會設一個cap咧？即係啲人好擔心暴利噉樣，佢即係全部走曬去一種盈利嘅模式咁嗰度會研究下。誒，李司長，主席，我哋其實成個模式咧都係同呢一個嘅承辦商係分賬嘅。咁當然即係我哋都會鼓勵，希望佢儘量做得好啦。唔係希望佢搞到即係一個好似普通。

309
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:17,030
嘅誒唔唔冇乜起色嘅商場噉樣樣噉，但係喺嗰個嘅誒所謂tray mix咧，即係話有啲咩嘅餐飲設施咧，我哋都要保障翻咧唔同嘅誒負擔能力嘅誒客人咧，佢哋都能夠有唔同嘅餐飲零售係可以享用到。呢個係我哋喺成個民政事務局同翻成萬商嗰個嘅誒。

310
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:46,000
誒，多謝主席。我係三分誒五分鐘同四分鐘。四分鐘。O K，誒，即係誒，我就注意到咧，即係我哋喺呢個項目嘅提咗出嚟之後咧，即係幾個階段啦，包括我哋同事嘅一啲反應。咁最初咧就有一啲同事就好擔心佢係大白象工程啦，就係基於咁咧係即係唔贊成或者反對。

311
00:53:46,000 --> 00:54:06,010
啦，噉我今日都好開心啊！即係近期都開始聽到咧，有啲同事都講話，佢哋都係支持嗰個體育嘅發展嘅。誒，不過噉就有一跟住一係列嘅關注噉樣。咁其實咧，即係呢個項目咧，即係最近譬如話誒誒，包括政府調動咗個議程咧，有啲同事又講話呢個。

312
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:26,020
誒唔係民生工程，就唔應該有噉樣去調動。咁喺呢，我都想特別指出咧。其實呢個項目係一個好重要嘅民生工程嚟嘅。佢唔單止即係影響到我哋，即係好多市民而家好缺嘅體育界好缺嘅誒體育場地。噉我相信盡早興建咧，係可以緩解到，畀到市民咧，即係更加多嘅。

313
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:49,490
咁另外咧，啲佢亦都係一個好重要嘅經濟項目啦。即係我一路都提嘅，其實政府除咗個三化嘅體育政策咧，產業化都係好緊要。噉我相信體育園區落成之後咧，係可以促進多咗好多個就業機會，同埋咧係會促進咗體育咧係可以產業化噉樣，係為香港咧即係嗰個經濟咧都注入一啲新嘅動力。

314
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:25,150
咁包括而家都係用一個即係投標嘅制度去去誒有競爭嘅噉，所以我就唔會反對當時話要津貼誒資助一啲即係投標者，確保有更加多嘅投入誒去競標咧，係事實上係好事嚟嘅嚇，因為喺嗰度可能慳得到嘅錢咧係會畀我哋投投標誒嗰個資助咧係。

315
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,350
唔請你。

316
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,720
係，唔該，主席。

317
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,100
係邊位答啊？

318
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,710
佢原來咧係估計。

319
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,690
咁好啦，咁到底政府係憑咩嘢攞到呢個假設嘅咧，主席？

320
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,930
我想問下政府係唔係你問過啲演藝界嘅？

321
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:58,490
Michael, yes, oh please. Thank you, Chairman. To respond to that question.

322
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:52,130
因為政府部門欠缺商業宣傳及採購專才和經驗。

323
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:17,880
主席，即係代表咩咧？而家我哋大球場大家都知啦，我哋係冇嗰個蓋㗎嘛，因為噪音啊嘛，所以係冇concert㗎嘛，冇演唱會㗎嘛。

324
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:36,950
數字咧，大概主場館嗰個收入咧，如果係DBG嘅模式咧，就係DBO嘅一半左右嘅。

325
00:59:52,410 --> 01:00:06,690
活動日數，即係話，如果係政府做DPG咧，嗰個活動日數咧，主場館咧就會同現時香港大球場日程表相若，即係每年十三個活動日。

326
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:40,750
朋友嘅意見，如果我哋啟德體育園係用DBG咧，佢哋係唔會喺嗰度開演唱會，所以你就先可以繼續用到呢個十三日嘅活動日去計嗰個DBG條數咧。唔該，第一個問題。啊，局長。

327
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:25,880
嘅咧，咁今日就收到啲答案啊，主席。咁個答案咧就引嚟誒，我感覺到好誒好奇嘅兩點嘅。第一點咧就係關於個主場館嗰方面嘅。咁誒而家喺誒上次公務小組嘅。

328
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:47,330
咁至於即係誒個場館嗰個儘快嘅落成咧，其實仲有好多好重要嘅其他嘅因素，包括譬如話可以真係做一啲國際性嘅比賽啦、一啲城市啦，為我哋嘅演藝界提供一啲好重要嘅場地啦，呢啲等等等等嘅好處咧都係好重要。咁但係我又注意到咧，即係喺財委會階段咧，仍然有好多啲同事咧仲係。

329
00:55:47,330 --> 00:56:07,340
去反反覆覆、重重覆覆去問一啲可能已經喺前一個階段嘅公務小組解決曬嘅問題，或者政府已經答到嘅問題。當然啦，可能亦都有一啲係政府仲未答到嘅。咁答唔到，你再問十次都係咁㗎咯，即係唔能夠改變嘅。咁但係呢個長館嘅興建嗰個迫切性咧，誒業界嚟講係非常。

330
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:27,350
唔知重視嘅今日咧，即係中午咧，就已經係有有幾十個體育團體啦嚇，同埋即係港協委會好多主要嘅成員咧，喺喺樓下嚟到表達，即係亦都希望咧，我係能夠轉達佢哋嘅意見，就係希望呢個體體多體育園區咧，盡快落實係畀到咧呢個業界咧一個即係額外嘅一個誒，佢哋可以運。

331
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:47,360
作啊，可以去舉辦活動啊，可以做人鍛鍊嘅一個場地。噉我個個意見好清晰嘅。咁而我自己亦都喺前一個階段咧，誒三個星期之前咧就係做咗個問調嘅，市民係絕大多數咧都係支持嘅嚇，即係有有百分之六十幾就贊成要盡快撥款，有百分之二十就唔係好清楚。

332
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:23,790
咁誒，我自己最後一個關注咧，就係萬一喺投標嘅過程或者階段結束嘅時候，得唔到一個理想嘅標書嘅時候，咁政府到底有咩嘢嘅後備嘅備用方案可可以去面對，而係繼續盡快落實呢個園啟德特區園嘅建設咧？多謝主席。畀輸咗誒，主席。

333
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:43,800
其實誒，我哋今次提出咧咁多一啲嘅比較新嘅設設想咧，包括啊提案有因咧。其實正正就係希望能夠令到我哋今次嘅投標咧係求巨吸引力，亦都能夠攞到一啲好嘅標書。咁所以如果能夠攞有埋呢個提案有因咧，我哋都有啲信心咧。今次呢個投標嘅誒誒嘅誒。

334
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:26,010
咁對我嚟講咧，我喺誒體育園嘅其中一個重要一個關注就係，如果我哋由政府去直接去誒用我哋嘅方法去管理，而我哋係仍然能夠維持到個運作。

335
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:46,410
即係話，我哋唔會蝕好多錢嘅話咧，我係認為我哋應該行D B G嘅模式，而唔係D B O嘅模式嘅。咁咧誒，之前喺公務小組咧，主席，我就問咗政府就攞咗啲數字就做比較，咁咧就啲新聞出嚟賣咧就話哦。

336
00:58:46,410 --> 00:59:06,420
原來咧，如果係D B G咧，噉就去到第三年先有盈餘，仲要係好少嘅。噉啊，相比起嚟，梗係爭好遠啦。咁跟住我就誒再書面問政府咧，就係到底你講到而家D B G嗰個數字咁唔靚仔，嗰個背後嘅假設係點樣？

337
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,110
Thank you.

338
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,800
係，請繼續啊！

339
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,110
我呢一part，我想我做個總結，就係話。

340
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,680
啊，主席唔好意思，我要打斷佢啊。

341
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:07,640
你係會揾佢答定係點？定係佢佢根本聽唔到佢問題。

342
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,730
So, are you going to answer what he just asked? Right, please continue.

343
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:52,850
佢係咪話畀我聽用DBG咧？喺未來啟德體育園係冇演唱會嘅。

344
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:13,240
The main difference is that the DBO model assumes thirty days compared with thirteen for the DBG.

345
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:29,850
The assumptions are based on the existing reference point in the Hong Kong market, and that is the driver for that number.

346
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:06,360
We have a difference in the event days assumption between the DBG and the DBO model.

347
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:22,470
No, we are not assuming that government would not be able to hold other types of events beyond sport. That is not the case. However.

348
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:47,090
其實我我係明嗰個商業嗰part嘅，但係政府而家提交嘅文件咧，就係話十三日就係同現時香港大球場日程表相約啊嘛，而家大球場係冇演唱會嘅。

349
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:29,010
The major driver for that difference is the commercial motivations of a private sector operator and the experience of a private sector operator in promoting, securing and marketing both international and local events.

350
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:51,450
即係噉，即係話份文件係錯喎。即係而家我哋你睇下佢答我封信嗰個附附六一咧，佢係講緊十三個活動日就係同現時香港大球場日程表相約。咁日程表而家我哋就係嗰啲Robby啊，跟住有少少嗰啲表演賽嗰啲嘅啫。咁即係點啊？我

351
01:02:51,450 --> 01:03:11,460
其實我覺得有啲唔對嘴，即係如果份文件係講十三日係講大球場嘅話，就同頭先誒顧問講嘅版本唔同。顧問講嘅版本就話：哦係啊，政府即係佢比較誒招商咧比較差啲，所以咧唔係話冇，不過咧定係少啲咁解嘅啫。噉我基本一陣間我會下一round再問，但係。

352
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:37,520
係嗱，或者你你或者請再撳，我或者揾下委員長答咗你個問題先，係嘛，委員長係誒主席。其實而家咧喺大球場咧嗰啲活動日當中咧，有包括都相當多咧係啲甲組或者叫港超聯嘅足球賽事嗰啲咧，就並唔能夠咧係誒帶嚟好多嘅收益嘅。但係將來喺啟德咧，佢個主場館咧雖然係十三日。

353
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,100
誒。

354
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,630
啊，秘書長。

355
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:38,220
幾個問題，我想問問，究竟呢個圖誒？

356
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:19,470
得得嗱嗱，你請你再撳啦。嗱，跟住阿亢俊宇議員嚇。

357
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,180
幾個問題㗎，我睇到個表咧，即係我覺得個表咧近乎有啲誤導啊。

358
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:44,020
啊，處方係咪可以寫包單？呢個圖你哋而家肯定個數字係真㗎啦，啱㗎啦。唔該，主席。

359
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:56,690
但係我諗佢個問題就係話，誒，你冇計演唱會啊嘛？佢意思即係話，就喺政府做都可以有演唱會，你冇你冇解答到呢個問題喎。

360
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:34,660
能爭取最大收入，所以咧佢就認為佢哋每月租金就三百六十蚊啦。相對於如果交畀人哋去做租金，租畀人咧就八百四十蚊，我唔知係點計。

361
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:47,880
但係咧，佢咧當中咧亦都已經包咗一啲係有收益嘅，譬如話演唱會嘅活動嘅，所以日數可能係相若，但係其實當中咧帶嚟嘅收益咧，同而家喺大球場咧係有分別嘅。

362
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:15,040
即係就唔係十三日咗啦，要咁講，如果做埋演唱會即係。因為誒主席，主席呢個主要原因咧，就係誒而家目前咧，我哋用康文署嘅模式去營運咧，我哋係唔會主動去招，即係點樣講，即係去招商啊，即係唔會話誒請演你哋做演唱會啊，人嚟參。

363
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:39,760
主席，咁呢個咪問題所在咯？根據附六一，誒而家啱啱講緊嗰個話題，我相信咧，即係大家支持體育發展係真㗎啦。但係個問題係咧，喺呢次嘅討論裏邊，點解要咁謹慎咧？而家咧，假如唔問得清清楚楚、明明白白咧，有啲數出咗街咧，撥咗出去嘅水咧，我哋追唔翻。咁所以而家擺喺眼前有。

364
01:04:44,570 --> 01:05:04,580
D.B.G話會連十三個活動咁呢個咧，就係根據而家香港大球場嘅日程表所顯示。我真唔係好明，我先假設到其時啟德體育園係由政府營運，噉你冇理由就跟翻而家大球場大球場點解冇演唱會？大家知啦，因為佢冇個頂啦，有噪音啦，咁而。

365
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:24,590
根據政府嘅管理下，一樣係受歡迎㗎。如果你個硬件嘅場地喺度，人哋嚟做演唱會，你唔會影響㗎。而所以，你用一個舊嘅數字，呢個此其一唔合理。第二，零售同埋餐飲設施咁咧，佢哋講法就係因政府部門欠缺零售和餐飲方面嘅經營，以及設計未必。

366
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:54,950
即係你話，如果你哋冇嗰個嘅專才、冇成嘅，方一隊出嚟咯，或者揾人專做生意咯，我真係睇唔明。而家你嘅講法就係咧，嗱，你記咧就係而家用新嘅誒，而家用呢個新嘅場地D B G模式嘅話咧，十三日呢度經已係一個問題。第二點嘅係三百六十蚊嘅租金，我覺。

367
01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:14,960
覺得假如政府經營一樣可以租得貴嘅，尤其是嗰個地段近地鐵站。第三，如果我想問嘅，而家你就話啦，喺一個政府所需資本嘅投資裏邊咧，政府如果行D.B.G咧，就畀多三至四億嘅開拔費咁多啫。如果D.B.G最終嘅情況就係畀多三至四億。

368
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:34,970
嘅開拔費，但係政府去經營二十五年嘅長達呢個營期，起碼都能夠有立法會去幫手監管，而唔係撥咗出去啦。有得一啲嘅私人公司自己話曬事啦，然後咧就最擔心就日日演唱會就益唔到本地一啲精英嘅運動員啦，又或者真係做唔到體育發展，呢個我擔心喎。咁所以。

369
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:58,620
都係嗰個breakdown嚟嘅，噉我就注意到咧，相關嘅兩組數字係完全一模一樣。

370
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:36,690
喺大數嗰度反映翻，將政府呢個提案有因策策略嘅改變，點解唔能夠反映到出嚟，主席？

371
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:51,730
文件嘅第七頁嗰個數目嘅財政嗰個breakdown，同而家FCL一七一八十四號文件附件第七頁。

372
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:07,810
除咗咧，係喺下面備註嗰度咧，係講提案有因由一億八千萬改到一億二千萬。

373
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:29,480
嘅誒，即係誒落標嘅投標者嘅費用嘅時候咧，其實我哋都唔想去改動咗嗰個百分之十嗰個嘅嘅應急費用嘅數目嘅，咁所以我哋仍然都係維持翻係二十三億呢一個數目嘅。

374
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:22,680
我知道，如果由政府去做經營咧，就有立法會嘅監管。如果到期時呢樣嘅公司經營得唔好，例如話佢協助又或者冇注重體育嘅，佢最大嘅代價就二億保證金加嗰七億嗰個嘅冇公司擔保。咁呢個係令我擔心嘅，主席。

375
01:06:45,910 --> 01:07:05,920
主席，誒嗰個先答翻商業嗰個咧，其實呢個咧就係誒我哋覺得係非常之準確嘅，因為而家我哋所謂八十八百四十蚊一平方米咧，呢個係睇翻而家喺誒嗰個區域，九龍城啊、黃大仙區嘅商場，佢哋攞到嘅即係用商業營運模式去攞到嘅租金，大概係呢一個。

376
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:25,930
價錢噉，但係如果你話用政府嘅模式咧，我哋都參考翻。如果用誒政府產業處佢哋去做一啲嘅投標，又或者康文署佢哋自己去就住啲餐飲零售去投標嘅時候，嗰一啲攞翻嚟嘅租金咧，亦都係大概係有幾三六十。因為其實咧租金咧就唔係睇邊間公司經營嘅，我而家畀塊元朗嘅地畀你，然後畀個公司。

377
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:45,940
你經營啊，公司收嘅租金係收嗰個公司認為我係靚公司，所以收靚租金啊，定還是我係偏遠元朗嘅租金咧？所以而家其實擺喺眼前呢個地段係黃金地段嚟嘅。我當啊，真係D B G，然後就用呢個政府營運都唔係三百六十啩，定還是你哋冇爭取啊，主席？

378
01:07:45,940 --> 01:08:05,950
我相信咧，誒由邊一個營運者去營運咧，其實誒得出嚟嗰個租金咧，係可能係分別好大嘅。就算係同一個地段，就算係尖沙咀誒，如果一個經營得好嘅商場，同一個經營得唔好嘅商場，其實可能個租金嘅分別係好大嘅。所以唔係淨係睇地段嘅。而家我哋就未知新公司經營得好與唔好，但係最起碼。

379
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:42,970
楊嶽橋議員四分鐘，好多謝主席。誒，我想跟進翻一個咧，上一次會議，譚文豪議員問過消失的六千萬嘅問題。噉我再次咧係將呢個問題咧想請教多次局方嘅。我比較緊咧喺公務小組P.W.S.C.一七一八二號文。

380
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:28,110
嗱，上次譚文浩議員問局方咧，就問即係如果冇咗六千萬，應該條大數咧必然係要反映翻出嚟。咁上次秘書長咧就，我覺得係答得有啲模稜兩可。今次我亦都見唔到有進一步嘅解釋，即係書面上邊。我想畀多次機會局方解答一下，點解唔能夠？

381
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:57,170
係啊，秘書長。誒主席誒，我首先咁講，或者我請一陣專員再補充。其實咧，我哋通常去計嗰個應急費用咧，大概咧個百分比，我相信即係大家坐喺立法會都係會好清楚㗎啦。大概係成個工程嘅百分之十到嘅，即係我哋要預計。所以我哋今次嘅工程咧，二零一六年嘅九月嘅價格咧係二百三十八億咧，百分之十大概。

382
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:17,180
係二十三億噉，所以我哋嘅應急費用咧都係以二二十三億呢個數咧嚟到為準。咁但係咧，我哋就係後嚟，因為咧提出咗有提案有因呢樣嘢咧，所以我哋就喺日應急費用嗰度咧就係抽咗一億八千萬出嚟，最高嚇嚟到去做呢一個嘅誒提案有因嘅費用。咁但係當我哋減少咗誒一其中一個嘅。

383
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:49,880
主席，誒，如果秘書長噉樣嘅講法係成立嘅話咧，我想了解一下，我假設以後，即係當然啦。雖然局方就拍心口就話，即係提案有因係一個好少機會出現嘅嘢，但係如果以後都會出現，即係再出現啦。而以後嗰個唔係三個嘅，可能係講緊十個嘅，咁講緊就六。

384
01:10:49,880 --> 01:11:09,890
億嘅即係備用資金啦，咁如果由十個減到五個，冇咗一半，咁嗰個嗰個數字係咪都會繼續唔變咧？即係呢個係咪政府一貫嘅即係？我想問一個係個policy嘅問題，即係係咪慣常嘅手法都會係噉樣？就算嗰條有實際數字嘅不同，但係都唔。

385
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:30,520
噉。

386
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:14,070
誒，你係減少咗一個去嚟投標嘅人，佢輸咗嚇誒，就你有啲賠償畀佢咁啦。

387
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:57,380
係唔該，係真係，我係望住向前，你不停咁講，我又聽到你講嘢喺度，就我要畀翻啲時間我，唔該嚇，主席。

388
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:48,390
言他就係嗰個盈利上限嘅問題。唔該，前面兩位，你唔好一直喺我面前講嘢，因為我望住你啊，兩位好騷擾。我向前望，你聽唔聽到啫？Hello，真係。

389
01:12:51,100 --> 01:13:05,190
啊！毛孟靜議員四分鐘。誒唔該，主席就嗰個提案有因呢一筆咧，你本來就誒畀多誒，本來係一億六千萬，咁而家啊慳咗啲咁嚇。

390
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:29,900
唔會喺大數度減咗佢。我想了解呢一點，主席。好，阿秘書長，啊，有冇啊？或者揾阿阿阿劉振講講嚇。好啊。誒，多謝主席。其實喺一般政府嘅公務工程嘅誒預算入邊咧，我哋都有一定比例嘅應急費用嘅。正如頭先阿秘書長都提及過，一般嗰個數。

391
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:49,910
額就係十個percent啦。其實喺當初咧，係誒設計呢個工程嗰個預算嘅時候咧，係未有提案有因呢一樣誒考慮嘅。咁呢個係喺後期加入嘅。咁當加入嘅時候咧，為咗誒令到個預算咧係即係誒即係誒不變咧，我哋預計咧嗰個。

392
01:11:49,910 --> 01:12:09,920
個提案有因咧，係會響嗰個應急費用嗰度出嘅。咁所以即係誒，如果係有呢個提案有因，就響個應急費用嗰度出啦。如果冇嘅話咧，個應急費用依然都要保留翻攞嚟做應急。主席啊，如果呢個邏輯係存在咧，咁即係話本來嗰個應急費用，我哋假設如果最初政府唔改變。

393
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:29,930
提案有因嘅策略繼續維持三個咧，咁即係話我哋備用資金其實相對係少咗嘅喎。咁即係話當初嚟攞我哋呢個大數係冇預備到有提案有因嘅嘛個講法。咁即係話本來有可能超支嘅機會係大啲嘅喎。呢個係咪即係邏輯係咪噉樣啊？主席係咪噉樣啊？劉振，你可唔可以解埋嘅？

394
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:51,100
係當然，如果誒嗰個應急費用有一部分咧，係如果係誒剔咗出嚟，係預備攞嚟做呢個提案紐因的話咧，咁個應急費用嘅數額係會變少啦。咁部門響誒處理成個工程嘅時候，就要更加小心啦，因為佢嘅應急費用相應係減低咗少少啦。即係基本上，你你個問題係啱嘅。

395
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:34,360
但係原來你慳翻嗰六千萬咧，你係唔寫入去嘅，噉啊，即係係係咁以氹下佢哋嘅啫。你講嚟講去係咪咧？啊，呢個係我問題一。而問題二咧，而家問題交著啊，就係一啲整個嘅項目咧，主席都會。

396
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:54,370
冇曬表情啊！真係，即係你話我哋誒，餵你問嚟問去好似差唔多嘅問題喎，咁嚇，咁但係係啊嘛。如果係你上次可以，誒，我減走一個誒失敗嘅誒落標人嘅賠償嚇，減走一個，咁點解你唔索？

397
01:13:54,370 --> 01:14:14,380
正減走多一個咧，又或者喺百分比嗰度啊？你話以邊個為低啲啊？嘛百分比而家就係五成嘅，有冇可能係可以啊？即即再低少少，以邊個低啲為準嚇？兩者之間係究竟係誒唔係每人畀六千誒六千萬啦？

398
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:34,390
啊！啊，抑或係誒計佢嗰個誒提提案嘅時候，所謂個你哋叫咩開拔啊？呢啲咩字嚟嘅，真係唔識嚇。即係嗰啲upfront costs係嘛？誒嗰度計一計呢個問題二，最後嘅問題三，好多人都問過啦，你次次咧都係顧左右而。

399
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:17,960
我個問題就係嗰個盈利上限就誒，正話官員咧又係又係答啦，就話誒主要係分賬嘅。噉你分賬得嚟啊？誒，你仍然畀佢有因佢喂賺多啲喎嚇噉啊，又唔緊要嘅，政府都有進賬嘅。但係問題係港鐵賺多啲。

400
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:37,970
政府係最大股東，政府都有進帳㗎。但係點解每一次係政誒嗰個港鐵係賺咧？佢係加我哋嘅票價㗎咯。嗱呢一個你真係你唔可以係純商業咁畀佢營運，你真係要考慮一啲盈利上限，因為呢個係一個公共嘅事業嚟嘅，唔該。

401
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,230
好。

402
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,180
阿秘書長。

403
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:26,230
因為如果係噉嘅話咧，對於成個好呢個答案係不嚇咁其他嘅問題咧，我問題二先。

404
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:55,230
誒，我哋就接受咗呢個意見嘅。但係如果再減得翻兩個咧，我哋認為不理想。好啊，噉啊，百分比咧？

405
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:45,750
草地啊，或者有其他場地設施嘅耗損嘅話，咁當中嗰個嘅維修嘅成本，嗰啲嘅細節其實喺邊度？誒，有冇講得清楚少少？

406
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:34,110
去分擔或者如何計算咧？因為按而家文字上去寫嘅話咧，講緊嘅設計同埋興建風險由政府嘅，咁但係營運嘅風險嘅話就係承辦商嘅噉。咁但係佢哋響平常嘅運作或者係用嗰啲場館嘅時候，譬如誒有。

407
01:15:40,210 --> 01:16:00,220
誒主席，我相信咧，我哋去誒之前我成提提咗好多次，我哋係擁有呢一個體育園嘅。其實我哋最緊要就係話，佢哋去收呢一個嘅市民嘅費用嘅時候，譬如話啲公共嘅體育設施係咪一個嘅合理水平？譬如我哋已經限制咗佢咧，要跟康文署而家一個相當低嘅收費嚟到收費，呢個係我哋所。

408
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:20,230
關注亦都係市民所關注，但係我哋係咪真係需要到去控制佢嘅盈利嘅上限咧？而喺我哋嘅成個嘅規管當中咧，我哋已經有好多嘅指標，有啲嘅客又係業績嘅指標，亦都有我哋透過要佢喺嗰個嘅誒營運嘅模式方面要符合我哋嘅要求，所以我哋唔想咧再喺個盈利嗰度咧係設加設呢個上限。

409
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:47,550
佢嗰個，我答啊，阿局長佢問就係提問有因嗰個，嗯就誒，佢譬如百分比低啲啊，咁嚇，或者啲錢銀數目係啊又少啲。原先咧就係我哋提出咧就係四個入圍，就誒後來議員有個意見咧，就可唔可以咧就係減到即係三個入圍就可以啦。

410
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:16,520
你所謂個百分比就係嗰個誒六千萬嗰樣嘢啦，六千萬嗰樣嘢。誒，如果你睇翻嗰個投標嗰個成本咧，剛才秘書長開始咧，就我哋估計咧都差唔多去到一億八千萬。咁所以咧就縱使佢輸咗，我哋都係可能畀翻最上限咧六千萬佢，即係。

411
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:36,530
係話咧，佢本身都要支出咧，係一億二千萬。咁呢個支出係相當龐大嘅，而贏嗰個咧係不會有呢個提案有因㗎啦。咁所以，我覺得呢個嘅係已經去到個大家係比較平衡啊，即係一個方案嚟嘅，既係可以吸引到多一啲嘅投標者，但係另外一方面嚟講。

412
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:56,540
亦都咧係能夠係可以係取得嗰個嘅平衡。我請你再咁啦，如果再問下鄭仲泰議員五分鐘。誒，多謝主席。誒，我問咧，可能係比較細嗰啲問題嚟嘅，因為我見到咧就喺文件嘅，即係頭先討論緊嘅附表一啦。誒，都有講到關於個D B O同埋D B G嗰個營運嘅分別嘅，但係因為

413
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:16,550
樣嘢咧，喺我其他文件嗰度都未睇得好清楚嘅，就係誒。如果喺D B O嗰個嘅營運嘅誒方式，尤其喺風險轉移嗰個部分嘅話，咁誒嗰啲嘅場館佢哋嗰啲嘅誒維修或者係耗損嘅費用當中嗰啲管理嘅誒成本係如何？

414
01:18:46,230 --> 01:19:06,240
主席，其實我哋喺回答公務小組委員會嘅時候咧，已經好詳細咁講咧。其實政府咧係唔會承擔任何嘅營運嘅費用嘅，包括日常嘅維修、管理、草地嘅保養都係由承辦商去負責。我哋只會咧係譬如話喺誒二十年後需要有一個嘅誒嗰個嘅大型嘅維修咧，我哋先至會。

415
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:26,250
係會出資去興做呢做呢啲維修，日常嘅管理係完全由成萬商負責。我我就係想，我就想問，就係關於一個大型嘅維修嗰個方向，因為有兩樣嘢啦，你冇諗過香港其實有大學嗰個天花板係一個運動場、籃球場噉樣，個成塊天花板冧落嚟㗎嘛？咁嗰個嘅話係維日常嘅維修。

416
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:46,260
定還是係即係嗰個叫做大型嘅維修咧？呢度係好多唔清晰嘅地方。其次咧就係話誒，喺呢啲嘅大型嘅體育園咧，而家其實都係面對緊一啲係關於恐襲或者係類似一類型嘅風險。咁嗰啲係即係呢一類型嘅風險嘅話，咁當中政府係承擔嗰個嘅維。

417
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,970
個情況咧，我哋會進行一個監管工作。

418
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,920
即係呢個部分有，其實係當中有冇考慮到？

419
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,510
主席，係啊，局長，即係其實呢個問題咧，點解會翻返到去咧？DBO模式嗰個優點。

420
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:59,990
請你再噉，阿梁耀忠議員四分鐘。主席，我上一次咧講咗，我唔贊成依一個噉嘅項目咧，其中一個原因咧就係話，你用一個提岸有因啦。噉你主要提岸有因咧，我就話你咧就係因為你用一個嘅一。

421
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:59,270
修嘅部分嘅話，咁唔係嗰個頭先嗰個講法啊，二十年要維修嗰種嘅解釋能夠係適從而來嘛？即係對於撥款上呢度有冇可以清晰再講多少少？

422
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:54,090
係非常之好，可能係宮廷式嘅，點解體育園都未定嘅？但係嗰個建造費咧就唔係佢畀喎，係你哋畀喎。有咩所謂啊？我至到美環美環，即係好靚，宮宮廷式嘅一種嘅嘅嘅設計都得。

423
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:43,600
即係，若果一開始我哋係有個噉嘅方向，同埋有十年期嘅中期檢討咧，營運商咧佢必定當然佢係希望能夠有一個盈利嘅一個目標。我哋都希望個場係搞旺嘅，呢個係大家嘅統一嘅。

424
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:18,450
跟住佢用完之後，佢話可能佢做十年做唔到，佢耗損令裏間屋完全爛溶溶嘅話，嗰個嘅成本係由政府可能係負責嘅話，咁嗰樣嘢係你長遠嚟講，你點樣可以能夠説服得到有下一個嘅承建商去會願意去為營運你嗰個嘅體育園咧？

425
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:19,720
非常之足。主席，我哋喺合約裏邊咧一定會好清晰噉樣寫，因為呢個係我哋同承辦商之間嗰個嘅責任嘅分工。誒，我哋其實答誒立法會議員嘅問題嘅時候咧，都有提到咧，所有嘅日常嘅運作開支啦，日常嘅維修保養支出啦，譬如好似電梯嘅年檢啊，頭先你講到天花嘅保養啊，冷氣系統嘅維修啊，保

426
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:39,730
就算係保安嘅攝錄機等等呢啲嘅，都係由承辦商去負責嘅。我哋咧就會可能喺一個合約，譬如話而家係二十年嘅營運期完結之後，我哋要再要重新投標，我哋需要做翻好個體育園嘅一啲基礎嘅設施嚟到先交畀下一個承辦商去做咧，呢筆嘅費用咧就會由政府去負責。喂，主席，我諗咧，即係點解會大家係對？

427
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:59,740
於嗰個嘅D B O嗰個嘅模式係咁多批評，你諗下嘅嘅情況係即係我係業主，然後我間屋裝修得好靚嘅，跟住我租畀個租客，個租客響一個冇特定嘅條款，即係話無論盈利啦或者去嗰個成本控制嘅條款底下，然後佢去用你間屋喎。

428
01:21:43,880 --> 01:22:03,890
所以如果佢需要係誒每年都有大量嘅賽事或者大量嘅表演喺佢嗰個場地嘅，佢必定係需要做好佢嘅維修工作，呢個必然嘅。但係去到你話點監管咧噉樣？誒，鄭議員，你你知道咧，我哋都會係成立一個嘅諮詢委員會。

429
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:23,900
我哋係會喺成立營運之前一年就請埋業界、體育界，甚至係立法會議員、區員等等咧，我哋都希望咧係能夠監管嘅，係將每一次每一年啊，即係一啲嘅指標，甚至係營運嘅情況，或者剛才鄭議員姐所講一啲嘅維修。

430
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:47,600
誒主席啊，因為頭先啊，局長佢都有講到嘅，就係話嗰個委員會討論嘅部分咧。誒，我本來其實啲個都會係再提嘅，就係關於誒誒佢哋講緊嘅就係啊未來嘅話，佢裡面有啲細項都會討論啦。噉係法例上一啲嘅部分，我留翻依家先問。好啊，誒。

431
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:20,390
條龍嘅方式做招標，包括咗係設計、建造同埋營運咧，噉你一定咧就係嗰個嘅投標者一定少，用同樣一引多啲人去投標噉樣樣嘅。咁但係你呢個一一條龍式嘅做法咧，我就好擔心嘅。上次你解釋話咧點解一條龍式咧，因為佢要營運啊嘛，咁營運咧要話。

432
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:40,400
達到佢營運嘅最大效益嘅話咧，由佢只設計就最好啦。噉樣樣嚟講係咪？呢個係你嘅觀點。但係我諗到個問題咧，當時我哋咧喺呢個科技大學咧，被批評為一個叫做勞斯萊斯式嘅校校舍，就係佢要達到自己嘅營運最大效益嘅話咧，佢設計到緊係係尾輪尾換。

433
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,970
得不償失。

434
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:17,470
阿局長，主席。

435
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,170
否則，你將佢分開嘅話咧。

436
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:13,520
我相信係會超過呢個數。

437
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,890
但係，當佢真係去建造嘅時候咧。

438
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:15,090
宮廷式咁靚嘅一個嘅嘅一個嘅誒設計咧。

439
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:40,320
而唔會做咗一個咧，係佢浪費資源嘅美輪美奐嘅體育員出嚟咧。

440
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:24,060
梁議員提呢個問題咧，正正就係要點解用D.B.O.嘅模式嗰個優點。

441
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:47,490
主席，而家我哋成個政府咧，都有一個嘅即係比較指導性嘅一個原則。

442
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:47,730
佢必定係以個配套咧，佢就可能個成本係上升得好緊要嘅。而家佢要配合嗰個嘅設計啊嘛。

443
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:56,490
將來呢啲大型嘅基建，不單止係體育園，我哋自己都講咗咧，一定係實而不華嘅。呢個係一個原則嚟嘅。

444
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:36,480
若果我哋將佢分開，正如阿梁先生所講，如果你設計嘅時候，甚至有時做比賽嘅時候，當然係美輪美換嘅，先至可以得獎，先可以入圍。

445
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:10,580
咁又好嘥我哋錢咯！你保證佢有佢佢有有有盈利得到喎？噉啊，即係話咧，我哋好啦，我哋咧就出曬錢嚟畀畀人哋去做生意，畀人賺，呢個係咪合理？係咪做做翻係咪好好咧？你點去監管未來嗰個體育員咧？唔係好似～

446
01:24:48,010 --> 01:25:08,020
所以如果將兩者放埋一齊，但係我哋係有一個上限嘅。我哋而家個上限已經拎咗出嚟啦。你不可能係超越嗰個上限，做埋設計、做埋建造、做埋營運，係咁多錢啦，cap咗㗎啦，再多都冇啦。嗱，個好處就喺呢一度。

447
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:35,260
所以呢一個嘅D B嘅模式咧，個優點就喺呢度。但係主席啊，你點限制咧？你嘅上限裏邊可能佢用咗你上限咧，本來原則上嗰用一半已經夠㗎啦。但係一覺得哇唔係，仲有咁多左你一半，點解我唔大做大翻同翻埋嗰一半去啊？你點去肯定一樣嘢就話你嘅上限就啱啱好？

448
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:16,790
所以我哋而家計算呢一個嘅數字咧，我哋基於呢個原則係計算出嚟。至於投標嘅時候，如果佢嗱投標佢有競爭性嘅喎，佢投標越低個價格越低咧，佢分數越高嘅喎，入圍機會越高嘅喎。所以如果佢投標最後係得，我哋cap咗三百一十九億，佢投。

449
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:16,610
畀佢。

450
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,440
標可能係二百一十九億。

451
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,530
有咩有咩咁出奇咧？

452
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:45,660
明明明顯上嘅違規當然未必有啦，但暗地裏違規你點知道咧？

453
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:55,560
即係我都明白嘅，不過你就就因為我哋而家大睇大廈維修咪情況已經清清楚楚啦。數字係點樣樣投標去説明呢個問題啦？嚇！

454
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:38,730
我哋歡迎嘅，如果佢能夠做得到嘅話，但係我哋而家呢個數咧係基於我哋最近嘅一啲嘅工程嘅一個嘅即係結果，我哋係推算得嚟，希望能夠接近嗰個事實。你咁講啫，但係呢個係一個嘅招標咧，係冇人有任何保證嘅喎。你點知道咧？因為大家違。

455
01:26:55,870 --> 01:27:15,880
我阿陳志全議員四分鐘。誒，主席，我想跟進翻誒提案有因嘅問題。其實我哋講緊提案有因嘅時候咧，就係希望攞到合理具競爭性嘅標書，或者攞到最多嘅標書。但我聽咗即係幾次咧，誒秘書長咧重重複複講呢兩個。

456
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:35,890
概念，但係就冇一個誒客觀嘅標準，咩叫合理數目嘅標書？咩叫做具競爭性嘅標書咧？誒，如果眼前得兩份標書，兩份標書咧都係喺你嘅財政預算之內，噉你會唔會係二減一咧？定係你會覺得啊，兩份標書？

457
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:55,900
設計出嚟都唔靚，所以咧又要再去即係招標咧。我想跟進翻嘅咧，另外咧就係楊嶽橋議員即係上次嘅提問，叫誒舉一啲外國嘅例子，關於提案有因。咁政府都覆咗個文件，咁有兩個個案，一個係澳洲新南威爾斯省嘅會議展覽中心，嗰個就因為咧最後。

458
01:27:55,900 --> 01:28:15,910
又有一個打退堂鼓，噉佢就驚咧，剩翻嗰兩個咧都唔知會唔會流標啦，所以就臨時就加咗嗰個提案有因。另外加拿大蒙特利爾省嗰個誒新嘅上普蘭大橋咧，嗰個就係話誒提交意見書預審就有六份，咁三份就入圍，佢哋就。

459
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:35,920
要去提交標書啦。噉，我想問呢個個案裏邊，其實誒佢或者政府係咪都係跟住噉嘅模式？我而家誒畀兩個提案有因，即係兩個叫做安慰獎或者補償啦嚇。噉係咪我哋諗住最後咧就係誒三個三個入圍？其實呢個例子裏邊咧都講唔到。

460
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:55,930
好，其實有與冇，其實個分別在於點嘅。反而呢個誒加拿大嘅蒙特利爾省嘅上普蘭大橋咧，我揾到網上揾到佢嘅個下集啊，主席下集咧就係由嗰間提供最低價嘅就中咗標啦。但係佢中咗標之後。

461
01:28:55,930 --> 01:29:15,940
咧喺兩年嘅工程之後咧，佢就向政府提出訴訟，就話咧政府喺一啲道路限制啊嗰度咧，令到整個工程嘅成本係上升，就向政府咧係索償一點二四億嘅加元嘅。咁即係呢啲我都會擔心嘅，即係價低者得咗之後，跟住原來佢係睇住你嚟食，即係你判咗。

462
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:36,900
或者佢已經揾到一啲漏洞啊嘅嘢，跟住就之後咧，再誒向你提出話啊，原來呢個咁低價其實真係做唔到啊，因為因為乜乜乜乜乜啊，噉就提出訴訟咧，就先至最後，你以為嗰個價錢誒就係得，點知就可能隨笨隨精變咗笨噉樣咯。政府有冇擔心過呢啲情況咧？

463
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:56,910
啊，副長係啊，理事長，主席，或者我答咗第一個問題，我請我哋嘅顧問去補充翻嗰兩個例子。誒嗱，我哋最初嘅設計咧，就係希望有四個嘅誒預審嘅標書，然後有一個係誒入圍咯，有三個係落選啦。我哋就有三個嘅誒提落選嘅投標者有提案有因。

464
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:17,080
咁但係，因為經過立法會討論咗咁多個鐘頭咧，我哋都同意係修改咗。就算我哋已經係set咗，即係再罕憲咧。而家話咗畀所有投標者聽咧，而家得翻三個啫。我哋而家只係會預審三個嘅入圍標書，有兩位如果係落選嘅咧，可以有機會攞到最高六千萬，不超過百分之五十嘅提案有因。

465
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,370
但係。

466
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,460
咧係理想好多嘅。

467
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:51,270
而家我哋問立法會攞一億二千萬最多係去畀嗰個嘅提案有因，然後我私底下又去揾多六千萬。如果有第三貨嚟嘅話，我係唔可以噉樣樣做嘅。所有嘢都係要透明度高，一早要話曬畀所有投標者聽。

468
01:32:51,580 --> 01:33:10,470
哦，即係誒喺得體育園啦。其實呢個全資擁有嘅意義究竟係啲乜嘢？佢畀幾個percent，其實都係我哋都係大股東。而喺迪士尼入邊，我哋都見到作為大股東咧，其實佢嘅權限亦都唔係話即係好大嘅啫。即係我想你答我呢一係列嘅問題，風險轉移嘅問題，同埋點解要全資擁有？

469
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:37,200
其實個競爭性咧已經喺我哋呢個嘅誒，即係誒調集之後咧係減低咗，多翻三三張標嘅啫。我哋而家最多可以預審三張標，咁即係話咧，如果呢三張標都能夠係合乎我哋嘅標書嘅要求，即係我哋已經寫咗一啲嘅要求出嚟啦嘅話咧，我哋咧係有三個裏邊揀一個。

470
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:57,210
咁但係當然，如果再一個差啲嘅情況，得翻兩個標書只係合符資格嘅時候，我哋係咪一定唔考慮咧？呢個唔係嘅，最緊要就係嗰兩張嘅標書都係合符我哋所有嘅誒合約裏邊講嘅一啲嘅要求。但係如果得翻兩張，一個危險就大啦。四時蚊我哋成日會有擔心，越少嘅。

471
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:17,220
個標書流標嘅機會越大咧，呢個就係我哋所提出。如果我哋有四個裏邊，我哋揀一個嘅安全度，梗係高過我哋三個揀一個，或者甚或兩個揀一個啦。其實呢個數目咧係有一個嘅誒關鍵性。費書想，但係點解你假定冇提案有因佢唔肯交咧？即係即係雖然你話係要即係億億幾噉樣啦，即係嚇。

472
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:38,670
如果你即係話，而家我只係會最後收三三份標書，即係就唔會交第四份㗎啦，即係你交嚟我都唔唔睇㗎啦噉樣，定係你話嘅現實世界唔會有㗎啦，即係因為你哋計完條數億幾誒？主席或者好簡單答啦，因為我哋做一個嘅投標係要好高透明度嘅，我哋唔可以話。

473
01:31:51,550 --> 01:32:11,560
好啊！請你再再撳啦，啊陳燕，啊劉超麗議員四分鐘。多謝主席，我都係想問翻秘書長咧，關於風險轉移嘅問題嘅，因為咧啱啱去抄翻顧問報告入邊嘅一啲即係參考資料啦，分別就係Mountain同埋Roger Place嘅佢哋嗰啲誒即係合約嘅規條咧。我哋發覺佢哋做嘅風險管理係做得相當唔錯。

474
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:31,570
嘅一方面咧，就係誒Mountains嗰度咧，就係承建商要自己融做咗融資先，畀咗錢先。咁而Roger Place嗰度咧，佢哋係會自己有一部分嘅承租費咧，都要自己去分擔啦，幾個percent啦。咁而另一點咧，就係其實佢哋喺整個design and costing啊，design and building上面咧，係有個封頂嘅兩個合。

475
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:51,580
亦都係有一個封頂費喺度，即係政府就唔包㗎啦，超支噉。我就想問下，究竟我哋喺呢一方面有啲乜嘢即係風險轉移嘅措施係做咗咧？咁而頭先咧，秘書長話答我咧，即係點解唔叫呢個即係承辦商要畀部分嘅費用，就係話你咧就希望政我哋政府希望全資擁有即係呢一個。

476
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:30,760
啊！秘書長，啊主席，誒，我哋其實咧就誒多次都答過㗎啦。如果我哋能夠喺今個立法年度攞到呢一個撥款咧，我哋係相當有信心。我哋而家批到嘅撥款係足夠我哋去建造同埋興建呢一個嘅誒體育園嘅，所以封頂嗰個問題咧，其實誒我哋相信嗰個。

477
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:50,770
誒有嗰個誒價格調整，同埋係應急費用咧，係足夠我哋去做到呢一個嘅項目。咁但係頭先誒，劉議員提到話點解我哋唔可以用即係譬如合資嘅形式去做咧？就算我哋佔百分之九十五誒，呢一個嘅私營承辦商佔百分之五又得唔得咧？其實誒，如果我哋用一個合資經營嘅形式咧，其實好多時候咧，睇翻。

478
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:17,540
畀錢咗。

479
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:32,690
哇！被車長。

480
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,340
好，下一位咧，阿鄭松泰議員四分鐘。我最近。

481
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:16,250
做嘅嗰個人，咁究竟我哋點解會對佢係有信心咧？

482
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:09,820
延遲一個月，佢係要賠償我哋一億三千萬。

483
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:45,980
跟建造嘅風險啊，超支嘅風險啊，你就好主觀咁答我，你有信心，噉我真係對你呢個有信心，好冇信心喎？

484
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:30,370
出嘅機會，噉我想問嘅就係政府響傾呢個DBO嘅合作嘅話，會唔會就住佢嗰個營運嘅監管上，即係話呢啲演出者佢哋都係有一定嘅指標，係同康文署而家啲將佢變得更加清晰嘅方法咧？咁呢個其一。

485
01:33:50,770 --> 01:34:10,780
迪士尼啊，或者係誒亞洲博覽館咧，嗰個嘅模式咧，嗰個營運者咧，其實都係要交託翻畀嗰一個嘅我哋嘅所謂合資嘅股股東嚟到去做。噉佢亦都會透過喺佢嘅營運嘅時候咧，先收取一啲嘅管理費啦。誒，同埋係佢哋嘅誒母公司嘅一啲可能係知識產權啦、等等啦。

486
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:30,900
咁所以變咗咧，我哋係先要畀曬嗰筆，然後先至大家係最後咧可以係分派嗰個股息，然後先至可以攞到個利潤。就唔好似而家我哋而家提出呢個建議咧，就係話同嗰個承辦商佢需要同我哋去包底同埋去分賬嗰個做法。咁所以我哋覺得而家我哋全資擁有咧係會比合資嗰個模式。

487
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:52,750
主席啊，我諗即係我諗在座所有同事都唔會滿意秘書長呢個答案嘅，因為我問緊你點樣轉移風險，就係有個機制去令到我哋有信心嗰樣嘢係唔會即係誒即係超出咗個預期啊嘛。你淨係答我有信心，你有信心，咁但係其實你係點樣確保嘅咧？即係呢一個咁主觀嘅判斷係。

488
01:34:52,750 --> 01:35:12,760
冇辦法令人滿意嘅，而好啦，到到點解我哋要全資擁擁有咧？你就話啊，因為喺嗰個即係營運方面咧，就係會有個好啲嘅利潤。但係其實當我哋問你哋點樣去攤分嗰啲利潤嘅時候，你都交唔到個細節畀我哋。噉你叫我哋點會有信心？即係你係做得到咧？始終嚟講，營運仍然都係即係去成咗。

489
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:37,830
誒，其實我係我自己都唔係好明白點解我哋一定要令到即係私營承辦商去擁有呢個體育園嘅部分嘅股權咧？其實點解唔係政府全資去擁有係更加理想？風險轉移其實係點樣做嘅咧？秘書長，你一直都冇答我呢個問題。其實而家我哋所有營運嘅風險已經轉移咗畀營承辦商。我係講。

490
01:35:46,260 --> 01:36:06,270
我哋而家其實投咗標之後，所有嘅營建造期嘅風險都係喺嗰個承辦商嗰度。佢投咗標落咗標係嗰個價，佢自然就要承擔嗰個風險啦。咁超支係咪佢負責？如果超支係所有由於承辦商自己引致嘅一啲嘅誒自然，當然係由承辦商去負責啦。而且我哋都講咗，佢每

491
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:33,630
多謝。誒，我係即係都係集中關於嗰個DBO咧呢一類型嘅公司合營嘅方式，佢嗰個監管上面嘅去討論嘅。誒，今次咧，我最主要係想問問，即係用一個用家嘅角度去去問呢個問題啦。首先咧，就係即係而家喺Common趣核下管理一啲嘅場館咧，即係紅館。

492
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:53,640
或者係其他大球場噉樣諸如此類啦，誒，尤其係紅館啦，咁都都有一啲嘅歌手或者係有一啲嘅演出者去批評嘅，就係當中嗰個係申請場地嗰個審批機制咧，係唔清晰同埋唔透明嘅。誒，亦都係可能係因為嗰啲公司咧，即係某程度上係壟斷咗一啲嘅即係演出嘅時間日期啦噉。噉我自己。

493
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:04,290
去誒執法嘅。

494
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:42,200
請問各方有冇當中有啲嘅討論咧？

495
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:28,470
O.K.，我請你再撳啦嚇，阿周浩鼎餘五分鐘。

496
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:38,400
要解決嘅問題嚟嘅，亦都喺文件裏面係應該已經係address咗嘅問題嚟。

497
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:11,960
誒主席嗱，如果係嘅話，就會出現咧，類似我哋出面嗰塊地嗰塊爛地嘅情況啦。

498
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:23,390
你你明白即係阿黎明嗰個事件啊，就係公眾唔落牌照嘅話，咁究竟響呢啲大型嘅活動嗰個申請或者審批嘅程序，究竟係去到呢啲嘅啲？

499
01:36:53,640 --> 01:37:13,650
好擔心嘅就係話，喺而家嗰個DBO個模式底下，如果變成一個私營嘅公司，或者由私營公司去運作嘅時候，誒一啲相對可能冇咁知名啊，又或者其實唔係大公司嘅一啲嘅演出嘅團體噉，喺噉樣嘅模式底下嘅，係會變相被人剝削咗一啲演。

500
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:53,640
誒主席，其實而家咧就誒喺呢個嘅主場館嗰度咧，即係將來主要可能會喺有一啲嘅演唱會咧，就喺主場館或者係室內體育館啦。其實我哋都會有一啲嘅要求咧，就係誒無論喺體育嘅設誒誒活動嘅日數咧，我哋會定咗啦。誒體育一定會係優先嘅，而喺嗰個嘅誒娛樂嘅活動方面咧。

501
01:37:53,640 --> 01:38:13,650
咧，我哋都有一個限制。咁將來誒嗰個嘅批審嘅誒嗰個嘅準則咧，其實都係會由我哋同呢一個承辦商咧係去再透過我哋嗰個互相嘅誒監察委員會咧係去傾，未必需要跟翻而家誒康文署嗰個做法。康文署佢自己亦都有一套嘅計分制度，嗰套計分制度咧亦都係透經過咧呢個廉政。

502
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:33,660
公署咧，佢哋係去審核過，係保證咧係一啲公平嘅同埋公開嘅制、公開嘅準則。咁但係將來我哋嘅體育員咧，嗰個嘅誒評分嘅準則咧，可能都會用翻我哋自己有一個啲政策目標咧嚟到去指導我哋去。主席，你你明嗱？呢個就係個關鍵。個關鍵係康文署而家本身都已經係有一個由廉政公署。

503
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:53,670
同埋係政府定一個嘅標準，即係所以，如果個其中一個用家嘅角度去考慮嘅話，咁嚟緊去到D B O嘅話嘅時候變成係即係私人去營運嘅話，咁大眾佢哋去享用呢一類型嘅即係場館嘅話，尤其係演出者咁當中嗰個嘅保障其實係而家唔清楚嘅喎。

504
01:38:53,670 --> 01:39:13,680
係咪咁？呢個係一方面啦。第二個方面嘅話，我想係更加用普羅大眾嘅角度去講嘅。誒，而家開門處下嘅，譬如係紅館或者係大球場咧，佢哋譬如係關於嗰個嘅公眾即係嘅一啲條例咧，佢譬如係炒黃牛飛啊等等嘅話，係有啲嘅漏洞喺度。咁但係去到啲邊？

505
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:33,690
嘅話，咁作為一個提案有因啦。噉我係一個營運商嘅話，咁嚟緊究竟政府響佢哋執法嘅時候，會唔會係好似而家康文署噉樣，係冇辦法係杜絕炒黃牛飛嘅情況，而導致提案有因下降咧？咁呢一個係法例上喺今日，其實你需要。

506
01:39:42,680 --> 01:40:02,690
啊，魏主席係誒，主席而家康文署嘅場地咧，就係因為佢係唔需要攞嗰個公眾娛樂嘅牌照啦，因為佢係一個豁免咗嘅場地。將來咧，其實我啓德體育園咧，佢都係需要咧去去攞呢個公眾娛樂牌嘅。咁所以變咗佢係誒可以引用公眾娛樂條例裏邊嘅一啲條款咧嚟到係。

507
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:08,680
你。

508
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,730
係誒，唔該，主席。

509
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:39,990
具體問題咧，就係。

510
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:03,690
四十蚊每平方米一個月。

511
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:06,860
噉我就想問，其實即係話。

512
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:37,170
個自由啲嘅方法去外判，噉我哋就喺裏面可以揾到更加多嘅誒收資方面誒做得更加好，噉我個。

513
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:22,730
我希望係可以利用佢作為即係支持到體育發展，特別係有啲嘅項目，佢係需要資源同時間去培養，就好好利用呢一笪地方咧，去誒即係誒可以培養到呢啲項目咯。啊，我主要想補充呢點啫，係。好啊，阿朱凱迪議員四分鐘。

514
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:44,640
時間可能個規模誒，未必係話可以賺到錢。噉我哋會睇翻個實際嘅情況，睇下佢嗰個誒需要係點樣啦。咁呢方面咧，我哋亦都有一個誒機制咧，係可以同入行嘅營運者咧去傾一啲條款咧，點樣可以令佢可以利用到體育員嘅設施咧，可以做得到嘅。

515
01:42:48,820 --> 01:43:06,550
政府都有個即係傾向，要推動到體育員會接受呢啲運動項目喺度舉行。噉我哋先可以繼續去推動更多嘅誒運動項目同埋盛事喺香港做嘅嘛。噉我想即係可能政府喺呢方面誒打一答我哋嘅，唔該啊，專員答啊，專員答答。

516
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:48,760
啊！多謝主席。啊，今日咧，其實就有好多嘅體育界嘅運動員啦、朋友啦，就嚟咗喺立法會。噉啊，剛才咧，亦都係表達咗佢哋一個好強烈嘅意願，即係希望咧呢個啟德體育園咧喺佢哋眼中係等咗十幾年嘅項目咧，係唔好再蹉跎歲月咧。

517
01:40:48,760 --> 01:41:08,770
可以通過噉啊！今日我亦都聽到有啲反對派議員就擺到明，就話咧佢係反對呢個項目。噉我唔知道佢哋點樣可以話到畀大家聽，佢又支持體育發展，但係又又要反對一個人哋等咗十幾年嘅項目啦。咁噉，我諗呢樣嘢就留翻畀反對派自己同翻體育界去做個交代啦。誒。

518
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:28,780
誒主席，我就想問下咧，就係嗱，第一啊，關於嗰個監督嘅問題咧。誒，我嘅原則咧就好簡單嘅啫。我認為咧就係話，政府做咗呢個啊項目之後咧，我認為大家就集中精力咧，就講清楚往後嘅一啲嘅監督嘅情況。咁其實咧喺。

519
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:48,790
喺早期嘅時候咧，我都有問過一個問題咧，就係話誒將來嘅營運嘅時候咧，因為呢一個嘅體育園咧，當然佢除咗係啊可以進行大型嘅體育項目之外啦，亦都係可以做一啲大型嘅誒娛樂嘅項目啦。咁誒中間點樣去喺兩者嗰個？

520
01:41:48,790 --> 01:42:08,800
活動嘅舉辦中間咧，點都要取個平衡咧，我就比較concern嘅，因為誒，如果純粹從錢嘅角度去諗咧，佢出發咧，佢有機會可能不如我寧願搞多幾場演唱會啊，我都未必一定好有意欲去搞一啲例如一啲比較新嘅體育項目，可能需要揼啲時間同。

521
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:28,810
成本咧，去將佢慢慢搞起嘅。咁如果純粹從錢嘅角度咧，佢未必有噉嘅意欲。噉我就誒都希望政府係可能喺度咧話清楚畀我哋聽咧，將來嘅監督就係話，除咗向嗰個錢看呢樣嘢之外咧，你哋都有指標話畀大眾聽，或者喺嗰啲團體啊。

522
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:48,820
去申辦或者係各種嘅盛事嘅時候咧，都有一個標準，就係話唔一定淨係睇個錢啦。因為如果某一種嘅運動項目，比如話大家有一日可能想引入即係木球噉，可能一啲國際盛事想擺喺香港度搞噉，噉佢需要時間，未必一定即刻係好有盈利嘅。咁但係咧，我覺得。

523
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:26,960
誒，主席，我哋誒喺城市嚟講咧，噉我哋而家已經有一個M R嘅制度啦。咁日後呢啲大型嘅城市咧，誒有一部分亦都係喺體育員嗰度做嘅。噉我哋呢方面咧，亦都會確保咧，誒體育員日後嘅營運係可以符合到呢啲大型城市嘅需要。咁至於阿周議員講話啲新嘅項目咧，咁誒譬如話佢初初嘅。

524
01:43:45,690 --> 01:44:05,700
誒唔該，主席，我只係補充一句啫，即係誒，因為咧到時喺執行嘅時候，當然你哋會case by case去睇啦。咁但係我都提一句咧，就係話好強調，即係誒，如果齋向錢看，噉佢可能淨係全部傾向盈利嗰方面去睇咧，我驚就太過側重就變咗失咗個平衡。噉我諗體育員花咗錢落去搞咧。

525
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:47,020
噉我誒延續住我上次嗰個誒話題咧，其實我想誒政府明白咧，而家嗰個所謂D B O同埋D B G嗰個節延二分咧，其實誒實際上唔一定係要噉樣㗎嘛。實際上我哋可以有更加多嘅誒。

526
01:44:47,020 --> 01:45:07,030
誒變數去講緊話誒，如果你話哦D.B.G好僵化嘅話，我哋又可以喺D.B.G嘅模式底下去揾一個彈性。但係基本嗰個前提咧，主席希望你明白，就係我係相信我哋政府喺呢個推動體育方面係有一。

527
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:27,040
一個好重要嘅領導嘅位置嘅。如果連政府自己都對自己冇信心咧，噉你不如個政府都外判咗畀私人公司做啦，係咪唔會㗎嘛？所以最基本咧，其實所以D B G對我嚟講係應該嗰個基本嚟嘅。跟住你再去調整，譬如話喺裡面有冇啲項目係用一。

528
01:45:40,930 --> 01:46:00,940
政府喺嗰個答覆我嘅附附表誒附六一咧，就頭先擴進議員都有引述過啦，就係話嗰個租金係誒三百六每平方米一個月啦。噉就誒D B O咧，噉就係誒參考鄰近零售市場租金就可以做到八百四。

529
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,250
我哋香港。

530
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,100
啊，見啦，彼此見啦。

531
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,790
跟住令到我哋可以做到一個。

532
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:24,660
有冇法例啊？係禁止你。

533
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:45,410
鄰近零售市場租金嘅安排咧，唔該。

534
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:20,470
靈活去做好咧，其實事實上我哋係做唔到嘅時候，就係做唔到咯。郭家麒議員三分鐘。

535
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:18,390
嗰個八百八百四十蚊啊，亦都唔係考慮有一個體育園咁勁嘅嘢㗎嘛，你都係求其一個商場咁解啫嘛，附近地區噉。

536
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:39,990
嘅就一定要揀DBO，點解係噉樣咧？我覺得係唔啱㗎噉樣，所以希望你計翻條數，無論喺嗰個零售、餐飲方面同埋主場館條數都係錯㗎。

537
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:37,290
我哋揀咗DBG啦，跟住你喺呢個零售、餐飲同埋呢個停車場嗰部分，係用翻一個最自由嘅方法去批出去。

538
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:55,420
阿B張有冇回應啊？誒，主席，我哋唔係特登去做低條數，我哋係用一啲我哋嘅經驗嚟到，同埋一啲事實嚟到去誒話畀議員聽。如果由我哋去做，嗰個結果會係噉樣樣。我哋都唔想構造嘅製造一啲不。

539
01:46:48,380 --> 01:47:08,390
誒主席，當然係冇法例啦，但係我哋政府係有一貫嘅採購嘅政策嘅，即係如果係一個屬於由政府去營運嘅商場，我哋就要跟翻政府嘅採購政策去做。噉我哋而家得幾款嘅啫，一係咧就係誒一啲叫做誒管理嘅合約，或者係一啲叫做收入嘅合約。

540
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:28,400
噉我哋嚟嚟去都係呢兩種。如果係用一個管理合約，就係我哋去誒，即係畀咗一個嘅誒承辦商，佢去將呢一啲嘅商場嘅地方去管理啦，或者咧就係我哋直接咧係去將呢啲誒零售餐飲直接去投標，然後收翻一個嘅收入。咁但係呢兩種形式咧喺過去嘅經驗嚟講咧，都唔係。

541
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:48,410
能夠做到好似私人嘅機構去做一個商場或者係一啲零售餐飲咁靈活，以致到咧嗰個收入咧係誒根據我哋一啲歷史一啲嘅記錄嚟講咧，睇翻嗰啲收入咧都唔能夠做到係誒商場一般私人機構嘅商場嗰個收入咯。我明啊，我係明佢而家嗰個做法，佢噉，但係我。

542
01:47:48,410 --> 01:48:08,420
我咪問佢有冇法例啊嘛？我哋首先講法例有冇嘢限住你冇辦法用一種再有彈性呢個方法，令到呢件事可以賺多啲錢啊嘛？噉你話冇啦，咁冇嘅話咧，其實我係好簡單嘅啦，主席。我覺得政府咧，即係喺呢件事上面好係好唔正常地重傷㗎，即係重傷都有個限度啦。

543
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:28,430
啊！田北神議員喺嗰個誒關於合著工時嗰個問題度都噉樣講啦，即係其實點解我哋明明係有條數可以做靚少少，畀到市民一個真正嘅選擇喺D B O同D B G之間，而你係冇做到，跟住特登做低D B G條數，令到我哋係覺得政府係廢。

544
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:15,750
不切實際嘅幻想，誒話畀大家聽。如果我哋自己政府做咧，我哋好靈活咁咧，我哋就可以賺到八百四十蚊一平方誒米。我哋我哋唔想噉樣樣去誤導大家，就係想話翻畀大家聽。如果係我哋去做嘅時候，就會係一個相差咁遠嘅一個嘅收入。因為我哋就算去承諾點樣點樣，我哋會。

545
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,070
認問咗。

546
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,120
餐餐都係畀人哋揾笨。

547
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:08,860
點解唔係正正經經？

548
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:12,990
以前都係咁做㗎啦，設計咗。

549
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,560
普及運動，政府冇幾多去理佢。

550
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:26,250
主席啊，即係頭先啊，周浩鼎議員就唔知係咪未瞓醒。

551
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:47,090
而家就攞一億二千萬幫人哋圍埋標，呢啲咩嘅做法咧？

552
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:42,670
嗰十一年咧，你同政府攞翻。第二咧，我就為啲體育界咧就係要申冤嘅。

553
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:05,490
點解政府會行一條要揾攞三百一十九億，叫全港市民出嚟做個實驗，叫做DPO？

554
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:56,820
老老實實，你畀我哋嗰兩個例子，其中一個陳志全議員都爆咗出嚟告翻政府，都係失敗。

555
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:35,790
嗰個體育園區拖咗十年，係政府。二零零六年拎上嚟傾，二零一七年先至畀翻立法會。

556
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:59,070
普通嘅任何一個區域入邊，缺少嘅係運動場，啲小朋友要去通街踢波，跟住政府就做一個假大空嘅體育園區。

557
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:11,360
頭先咧，我聽係秘書長講，真係相當威武。我聽到佢話：喂，佢話如果嗰啲人收多咗錢，點啊？即係誒，我哋揾佢負責，即係揾佢晦氣噉樣。

558
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:23,800
我哋入邊啊，有一百零三億咧預住畀佢食嘅，因為咧佢嗰個應急費廿二廿二點九億，價格準備調整八十億五千萬。

559
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:37,480
盲嘅都知道你政府預咗成一百零三億畀佢啦，幾時政府威武到試過？你話畀我聽最近幾次一次係超標，係可以告到個總承建商。

560
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:29,410
然後啊，設計建造，然後營運，清清楚楚。而家政府呢啲烏哩單刀嘅數三百幾億，我唔知到時攞嗰個係食你前嗰嚿好啊，後嗰嚿好啊，仲係全部食曬好啲。

561
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:12,760
啊，讀上。

562
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:45,610
控制翻咧噉樣，阿尹兆堅議員。

563
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:57,400
因為嗰廿五年賣斷畀佢㗎嘛。

564
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:37,500
對體育嘅發展，我已經講咗。

565
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:17,060
主席就每次啊，各議員發言咧。

566
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:57,060
當然，你話足唔足夠，當然係唔足夠啦。

567
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:22,330
一開始必然咧係要對政府有攻擊，有抹黑。

568
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,540
對體育嘅發展係攻擊同抹黑，我係唔同意嘅。

569
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:53,890
到時唔好喊啊！體育界啲朋友，佢話哦，呢啲冇錢賺嘅，對唔住，你行去第第二度剩啦。

570
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:22,180
另外一方面，剛才郭然亦都講咗喺普及方面咧，我哋喺十八個區未來五年都會投放二百億元。

571
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:53,080
喺呢多年嚟咧，體育界同埋政府都係高度合作，所以最近嘅體育發展係非常之蓬勃。

572
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:33,260
亦都係對體育嘅發展咧，係攻擊同背叛。我冇攻擊過體育發展。呢個咧，我係不得不講。嗱，局長，你收翻我幾時攻擊過體育界？

573
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:11,220
我想問啊，就係如果到時佢對唔住體育界，或者佢有任何嘢，政府可唔可以即時收翻嘅？佢亂曬大龍，可唔可以即時收翻？你咩方法可以告到佢攞翻錢啊？秘書長，你咁威武啊，局長。

574
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:12,990
所我更加要喺場地硬件方面係加緊興建，一方面係大型嘅城市呢個啟德體育園三百億元係要上馬，責任就喺國員身上，希望你能夠支持。

575
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:46,000
其實呢度咧個體育園區咧就得一連三百六十五日體育界聽住，得三十日咧係做活動，都唔係餐餐都係體育，仲有啲其他嗰啲活動。第二咧就係五十七萬平方尺嘅餐飲活動，嗰度先至係肉啊！

576
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:42,470
每一個區體育館又好，游泳池又好，都大量立即興建啦。呢個就係政府嘅一個決心。區區都會有暖水泳池嘅咧。啊，局長啊，時間時間夠啦嗱嗱，噉啊係啦，你你你再揀一撳啦，佢會答你㗎。我估啊，你一陣間答你話點樣可以有即係。

577
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,980
誒嗰個。

578
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:36,040
地跟緊嘅其中一單就係依個誒。

579
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:22,000
誒問翻嗰個啊主席，我我依依話三三分鐘係咪啊？係咪三分鐘，主席？

580
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:51,880
唔該，主席，唔緊要，我都會幫啊郭家麒追問嘅，因為咧，阿阿局長啊，即係。

581
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:59,340
大家均真啲啊！老實講，我唔知點解你咁慾緊呢嚇，唔知係咪一啱啱咪揦著阿周浩鼎啊？嚇你就～

582
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:12,220
其實某程度係一種另類政府補貼啫嘛，係咪？即係誒誒，我唔知我嘅理解啱唔啱，局長你一開答下。但係另另一方面，你又奇怪過，你又會覺得。

583
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:16,650
頂帽子轉咗啫嚇，即係幫佢擋兩拳啊，係咪啊？喂，周浩鼎自己即係我都唔想講啊，我本來想窒下佢，即係有有啲建制派嘅話支持公屋啦，提升到七比三你咪反對，不過算啦，唔好曬啲嘴皮嘅真係，即係局長唔使咁答問題嘅，我覺得嗱，我我就。

584
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:37,950
嘅數咧，其實係足夠支付佢去補貼翻佢去營運嗰個公營設施嗰個嘅費用嘅，咁所以成個嘅模式就係噉樣。所以點解政府係唔需要付出任何嘅營運費用都能夠攞到一個營運得好嘅體育員咧？正正就係我哋呢個DBO模式嘅優點。好啊，嗱，我請大家四點三五分翻嚟嚇。

585
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:42,290
O.K.，我想問翻個個概念，我都係唔係好明個概念。一越聽越有小糊塗，因為你個我唔唔知你個龍門係搬啦，定係定係誒？即係未諗清楚，或者即係hybrid得太緊要咧。我哋都唔知你幾時出邊一手。點解咁講咧？嗱，正話我都同事都講啦，呢個安排就好傻嘅。對於發展。

586
01:54:42,290 --> 01:55:02,300
嗰個即係啲管理者，我誒噉就進可攻退可守。嗱，有提案有因，又無需要分擔嗰個建造成本，噉就接近咁噉，又唔係完全無本嘅，接近低本生利啦，生一個幾大嘅利潤。噉就你會覺得噉嘅方法，即係。

587
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:32,690
其實真係要誒投標出去畀誒誒相關人等先先謀到利嘅噉就我我驚我冇時間講啊，主席唔緊要，我一間我先再撳。但係我我意思，我其實我有幾多例子嘅，包括咧政府用啲噉嘅投標出去而失敗嘅例子，其實好多啊。最近我。

588
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:58,270
紅磡嗰個誒博物館啦，大家知道嗰就係有就係基於有少類似嘅例子嘅。不過我一間嗰轉先再仔仔先問，就住呢一部分，我想問嘅係咩咧？就係誒，正話同事講嗰幾幾個誒場景，其實好合理嘅。我哋好擔心咧，即係營辦者啊，到最後是邊一個係個？

589
01:55:58,270 --> 01:56:18,280
定業啊，個本業啊，因為嗱，你又正話畀先生講咗，你嗰個體育收費你係限咗佢㗎嘛，係咪噉佢誒點樣投到呢個標咧？就係咧個投標價要靚啦，回報要比你哋回報要高啊嘛，係咪噉佢先得㗎嘛？噉佢即係孭咗一個好大嘅數嘅責任㗎嘛。咁而你又。

590
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:38,290
你又封咗佢頂，佢喺體育嗰邊啊，要同而家嘅一般嘅誒民湯收費差唔多係嘛，同一水平。噉佢必然要喺嗰度揾翻啲錢嘅喎。如果唔係，佢平衡唔到嘅嘛。我即時又諗到個狀況就係，如果我係承辦商，我點？我梗係咪曬所有心力時間喺嗰度，我先有利可圖啊嘛。

591
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:58,300
係咪？我就即刻諗起就係變咗一個，哇！好大型以體育為名嘅娛樂餐飲大商場，主席，噉就會唔會失咗原本我掟一嚿噉嘅錢入去嗰個嗰個原意咧？呢個可係可能性一嘅，主席，我仲有可能性二，不過我冇時間問，我喺度著答。答咗呢個先啦，阿秘書長。

592
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:19,570
啊，比較明顯係誒，因為我哋喺嗰個誒公營嘅體育設施嗰度咧，限制咗佢嗰個收入啊。咁所以其實佢主要嘅收入來源咧就係喺個餐飲零售同埋係主場館嗰個活動嗰度。咁呢個正正就係我哋想佢做得好嘅地方，所以我哋係希望佢能夠係誒做一個活力充沛嘅體育員。咁而呢一個個我哋計出嚟。
