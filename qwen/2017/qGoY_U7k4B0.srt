1
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,440
作呢個聲明。

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,430
多謝代主席。

3
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,860
嘅運作上相關嘅規則。

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:30,110
主席，頭正如頭先啊，發言所講咧，即係我係尊重啊，有關律師行業。

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,850
咧都唔係我哋一般尋常嘅方法，所以主席咧，我就想運用呢個議事規則四十括號一咧，係動議終止嘅。

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:21,960
由於盧偉國議員提出終止待續議案，本會現在先處理呢一行議案。盧偉國議員，請你就議案發言。

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:54,380
特別係如果你講到實習律師咧，係可能同佢哋行業嘅薪火相傳相關啦。噉我係尊重嘅，不過我提出個宗旨咧，就只係喺個程序處理上嘅嘅問題。所以呢個建議咧係絕對並非咧係對呢個律師行業不尊重。啊，呢度先。

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:15,990
誒，我亦都好相信啦。喺中指嘅跟住落嚟嘅同事嘅發言裏邊咧，其實佢都大有機會啦，係就呢個中指表達意見，亦都會涉及到咧佢對呢一個生效日期嘅意見。不過個人覺得咧，其實生效日期都冇乜好辯論嘅，所以咧喺。

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,520
呢一項拆息嘅議案嘅。

10
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:25,760
議員嘅論點，如果我認為議員違反有關規定，我會嚴格執行議事規則，停止有關議員嘅發言。陳淑莊議員。

11
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:49,290
有意發言嘅議員請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。現在嘅待議議題係現即將辯論終止，待續。

12
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:36,000
先前正若良美芬議員咧就報告咧，其實就真係冇一個冇冇乜爭議性嘅。噉我亦都唔希望咧喺議事堂上咧喺呢方面咧係用到太多時間，而至咧影響咗跟住好多咧係待我哋立法會處理嘅工作。因此咧，我發言都係好簡短啫。多謝代主席。

13
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:15,020
主要目的咧係拆釋內務委員會第五號斜洞一七一八號報告裏邊嘅二零一七年實習律師修訂規則生效日期公告，有關修訂規則目的係修訂大律師。

14
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:35,030
申請成為律師需符合嘅一啲規定，而拆息議員所述嘅公告目的咧，係指定修訂規則嘅實施日期。現在議員提出嘅終止待續議案，已提其實好雜，就係係咪支持將拆息呢一？

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:55,040
項附屬法例嘅議案辯論終止待續，議員不應提出與議題無關嘅事宜，亦都不應利用呢一項辯論討論呢一項附屬法例嘅具體內容，包括實施日期同埋有關大律師申請成為律師。

16
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:15,050
須符合嘅規定，議事規則第四十一括弧一條定明，議員不得提出與議題無關嘅事宜；第四十五括弧一條亦定明，議員不得不斷提出無關嘅事宜，或者冗敍繁厭地重提本身或者其他。

17
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,970
喂。

18
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,590
呢個終止代贊係咩理由咧？

19
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:37,450
等一等，陳議員。好啊，陳志全議員，你係乜嘢規程問題？主席，你頭先個温馨提示咧講得快咗，我聽唔切。你有冇準備定劇本啊？可唔可以派畀我哋啊？

20
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:57,900
稍後就住終止嘅內容嘅範圍咧，我哋可以有啊印冊本畀你嘅。哦，多謝主席，都話你整定㗎啦。請你坐低。係啦，陳淑莊議員。啊，主席啊，主席整定係嘛？今日都整定，我有機會終於見到啊律政司司長啦，即係我又哎呀，我真係等咗你好耐。

21
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:17,910
係啦，咁咧就話説咧，主席其實咧一睇到阿盧偉國議員撳掣咧，仲要咧係冇呢個撐喺度咧，都估到係做咩㗎啦嗱。所以咧，我就已經坐咗喺度預備撳掣，仲驚死撳唔接添。噉我已經見到咧，仲有毛孟靜議員啦，同埋陳志全議員。其實咧，所以咧，我已經揸定鉛筆咧，就等住聽阿盧偉國議員咧究竟講。

22
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:40,880
我覺得好神奇喎！至少咧，頭先咧歷史性時刻咧，啊，黃國建議員都係咁嘢拋咗幾個理由啦。第一，你話聽唔明啊，淘緊新議員嗰個，我又唔重提啦，因為有陣時睇下你有幾集中啦，又或者咧睇下你即係嚇究竟有冇睇過我哋講緊嗰啲係乜嘢啦，係嘛？好明顯啊！你你如果我冇記錯啊，你又唔係誒剛才。

23
00:04:40,880 --> 00:05:00,890
講緊嗰個誒誒嗰個叫做誒誒深圳灣嗰個啊，唔係深圳灣，我成日講係深圳，唔好意思啊，阿袁國強司長成日講係深圳灣添誒，即係呢一個港珠澳大橋嘅審議嘅時候咧，我我如果我冇記錯嘅話，你又唔係其中一個成員啦。噉啊，當然啦，你聽唔明啊啊，陶謹生議員咧，可能有都有跡可尋嘅。

24
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:20,900
但係跟住嗰兩個理由咧，都叫做似係理由啊。點知啊，盧偉國議員嗰啲理由咧，我特登寫嘅就係誒，又覺得生效日期咧就誒拆息又處理又好似唔係好啱，又覺得生效日期喺度講咧就誒會影響之後嘅嘢。咁當然真係曬冧啦，就話唔係影響嗰啲咩見習律師啊，或者唔係唔尊重成個律師。

25
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:40,910
嘅嘅嗰個行業啦，不過係程序處理嘅事宜嚟嘅啫。其實我完全唔知佢講咩。主席，你知唔知佢有咩理由啊？咁跟住你就咁跟住佢講到明咧，就係話生效日期啊，有啲意見噉樣啊，又誒又唔明點解大家要畀意見，就已經我唔知佢點解要中止。咁跟住你就話我哋連生效日期都唔講得，我都好想睇啊！你嗰個文。

26
00:05:40,910 --> 00:06:00,920
根本佢就提話生效日期，唔要要就住就係唔明點解要講你就話我哋唔畀講生效期生效日期。噉你哋兩個根本兩個人都唔協調嘅，係咪先咁？我哋而家要講翻我哋應該講嘅嘢，特別係就住盧偉國議員所講嘅生效日期。阿朱成，我係要喺度誒講個古仔啦，因為咧啊啊誒，我自己本身係大律師啦，我亦做過咧見。

27
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:20,930
練習律師，亦都做過律師。咁之後咧，我要喺我自己喺律師嗰個列表嗰度咧，除咗名之後咧，我先至可以成為執業大律師，或者叫做去申請做大律師嘅。好多人都未必知我呢啲，全部大家會睇得到嘅。咁呢個過程咧，就係今日見到呢一樣嘢咧，就係行翻轉頭。點解？

28
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:40,940
個日子咁緊要嘅，主席呢一樣嘢咧，真係我係撳第一係有原因，因為咧當年咧，我記得咧，即係可能阿阿袁國強師長就記得啦。當年咧喺大律師誒嘅時候咧，如果你想入去做誒誒，我哋叫做即係跟誒師傅啦，我哋做誒 pupil 嘅時候咧，唔好意思啊，啊主席，因為我真係。

29
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,180
我就。

30
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,010
點算法定人數？係陳志全議員要求點算法定人數？

31
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,550
修定令其實修定緊啲乜嘢咧？佢就係修定翻咧呢一個咧。

32
00:06:40,940 --> 00:07:00,950
知道漂浦應該點樣去譯啊？或者做學生嘅時候咧，噉你咧誒以前咧以往咧就係你一開始嘅時候咧，我哋已經要進入一個程序，就叫做call bar嘅，係你一開始就可以嘅。但係後期咧就改咗，就咧你要先跟師傅咧就六個月，跟住你先可以call bar嘅。噉我咧。

33
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:20,960
嗰陣時申請做大律師咧，就係嗰個尷尬期啦。呢個正正咧就係同生效日期有關。會唔會有啲人好似我噉樣咧？主席，我嗰個情況就係點咧？我當時咧就向呢個大律師公會咧就申請咗，我話咧我就我就入咗個誒入咗申請表啦，同而家咧裡面嗰個一樣嘅，佢都係要有申請。

34
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:40,970
人去做誒，向律師會去做進行申請嘅咁好啦。噉我入咗個表啦，噉我以為萬無一失噉啊。跟住咧就安排好曬跟師傅嘅誒誒程序啦。咁因為如果咧係誒資深大律師嘅話咧，我只能跟佢三個月。咁咧，如果係普通嘅大律師咧，即係未做資深嘅大律師咧，我就可以。

35
00:07:40,970 --> 00:08:00,980
跟佢譬如話半年噉樣，噉啊跟住咧，我哋就住呢啲嘅功課咧，我哋全部咧就要準備啲表啊等等，即係要填表啊，要畀翻師傅去填表嘅。咁咧，咁但係咧，我嗰陣時就出現咗一件事啦，就係原來咧，大律師公會咧，定係即係唔好意思啊，當時咧，因為可能我都唔太即係唔係太跟得太貼啦，嗰陣時。

36
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:20,990
原來啱啱就改咗嗰個制度，就係話原來咧，我有機會咧係唔係可以即時call巴，我要做半年之後先至call巴嘅。咁跟住即係咁噉，當然啦。如果我call巴即係等半年咧，我就可以開始咧就有即係有限度嘅可以咧去誒接誒一啲叫做生意，希望可以幫補下。

37
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:41,000
大律師嘅誒生活啦，因為咧，大家我唔知知唔知咧？誒做大律師咧，好多時候咧都係誒喺跟師傅嘅時候咧係誒冇收入嘅。咁如果師傅待你好嘅話咧，就可能會請你食晏，咁咧就會照顧你嘅誒食，當然會照顧你宿啦。咁但係起碼照顧你食咁咧，同埋係唔會有人工嘅，係直。

38
00:08:41,000 --> 00:09:01,010
到咧，係你有機會咧，係攞咗一張誒誒誒證書，你可以有限度噉樣去做一啲工作嘅話咧，咁誒仲要喺誒你嘅師傅誒，即係睇住你之下咧，噉你就可以接一啲嘅嘅工作，咁咧你就可以賺取一啲誒誒，即係籌籌金，可以幫補到你嘅生活。咁當。

39
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:21,020
時咧，我發生咗咩事幹咧？就係突然之間咧，我接接到咧呢一個大律師公會嘅秘書嘅通知啦。佢話誒阿Miss Chan誒，即係陳小姐，你可能誒要等多半年先得。我嚇點解咧？佢因為咧嗰個生效日期咧，就可能咧係同你嗰個申請咧係誒有啲誒未協。

40
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:41,030
調住噉，阿主席，你聽完之後，喂咁噉，即係點？你知唔知我嗰個我嗰個個案咧，終於咧係要攞翻一個法律意見，即係要問大律師公會攞翻一個法律意見，去決定點樣去處理。究竟我應該喺舊制之下可以即時，即係可以盡快啊就可以。

41
00:09:41,030 --> 00:10:01,040
call巴定係要等半年，即係要做咗誒學生半年之後先至可以call巴。我呢件事咧，我嗰陣時就好惆張啦，即係我係已經係誒，我已經離開咗律師嗰個行業，我就係想轉做大律師，但係連嗰個位咧，我都突然之間咧出現咗一個究竟call唔call得成他嘅嗰個。

42
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:21,050
即係做大律師嘅嗰個、嗰個、嗰個、嗰個成個嘅儀式，或者甚至一個好重要嘅技術喺法律上面一個一個情況。噉我當時就好好好緊張，真係好唔知點樣算。咁所以主席，你諗下，如果今次我嗱，我唔使睇文件啦。大家如果知道嘅話咧，就係今次咧呢一個嘅修訂咧嗰個。

43
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:41,060
生效日期咧，將會係二零一八年嘅一月八號。噉我就喺度諗啦，會唔會有啲人其實喺中間卡住咗，係對呢個生效日期其實係緊要，即係大家要留意嘅咧？我係絕對反對咧，阿阿盧偉國議員咧提呢一個終止代續嘅，因為呢一樣。

44
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,530
請議員保持肅靜。

45
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:32,590
佢講修訂緊啲乜嘢咧？佢就係話咧呢一個證書，即係話咧係當你想申請豁免，要去做實習律師嘅時候咧。

46
00:10:41,060 --> 00:11:01,070
誒雖然我明白嚇，而家都係呢個係附屬法例，先定立後審議。但係呢一個終止，但係呢個終止代續咧，係絕對喺而家呢個情況咧係不適合嘅。雖然我哋講緊嘅係好一個好窄嘅話題，係話一個生效日期。啊，因為阿陳志全議員舉咗手，你係咩事情啊？陳志全誒要求點？

47
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:56,630
陳續章議員，請你繼續。多謝主席。噉啊，講埋嗰個古仔啦。啊啊，未未未未開始開鐘，係O K。好啦，咁誒當時即係啱啱講到咧，就係話誒，我嗰陣時就即係究竟係應該係誒即刻可以即係成為即係call bar啦，成為執業律師啊，定係誒要等？

48
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:16,640
咁多誒半年，即係先至可以做到呢一樣嘢咧。咁當時咧就誒誒大律師公會嘅秘書處咧，好好你諗下，我嗰陣時都仲未係成員之一。噉佢咧就誒即刻幫我去研究翻，咁咧就攞埋呢個法律意見。咁最後咧，噉我就成為咗係咩咧？就係最後一個人。

49
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:36,650
啦，就係可以跟舊制，就係話咧，一開始我就可以成為執業律師嘅最後一個人。咁所以咧，呢一個生效日期咧，其實係好緊要，因為咧，今次嗰個生效日期咧，如果有一位人士佢本來而家係大律師嘅，佢已經有足夠五年嘅經驗，而佢想轉做。

50
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:56,660
誒呢一個誒誒執業律師噉，究竟呢五年係唔係可以計數？又或者應該咁講啦，因為根據咧誒呢個修訂咧，啊主席你都知啦。雖然講生效日期，但係你點都要睇翻咧嗰條條文咧相關嘅影響，佢呢一個生效修。

51
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:23,030
係啦，就喺呢一個咧，以誒呢個誒實習律師規則噉就係咧呢一個香港法律第一五九章嘅J咁嗰度咧就係講緊咧一啲相關嘅需要嚟嘅咁咧，而當中咧亦都係嗰個修訂一個生效，其實係修訂緊啲咩？因為我哋講個生效日期啫。

52
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:57,850
陳素章議員，請你繼續。好，多謝主席。咁咧，當你如果要做實習律師嘅話，誒，你由應該話由大律師轉做呢一個實習律師嘅話咧，究竟需唔需要做實習律師，定係你可以直接做呢一個誒執業律師咧？誒，或者有一個律師嘅資格咧，就可以避免咗做呢個見習律師咧，就要睇翻咧。

53
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:17,860
就係我頭先所講嘅誒呢一個誒香港法例第一五九章嘅J嗰部分嘅第二十條啦。噉啊，頭先啊楊傲橋議員都有講過啦，但係佢其實未講曬嘅。噉我亦都唔想太過深入去講，但係我正正頭先就係講翻我自己個經歷啦。如果個生效日期有即係個生效日期直接影響咧，就係話。

54
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:37,870
嗰個當事人或者個申請人咧，要攞到嘅資料咧就好唔同啦。當中咧就包括咧係呢個大律師公會提供嘅資料，即係話咧，如果好似上次咁咧，大律師公會自己本身會唔會因為就住一啲申請嘅日期而需要，或者個生效嘅日期而需要去，仲要諮詢法律意見等等。

55
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:57,880
等咧，定係一個內部一睇就可以好明白、好顯然易見咧。而且咧，主席啊，你睇翻咧，佢而家誒有一啲嘅誒部分咧，其實咧係關於咧佢嗰個誒呢一個叫做誒申即係叫做申訴及措手聆訊。但係咧，當然誒呢一個咧機制咧就係講到咧就係話大家咧係可能係對。

56
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:17,990
誒一啲大律師咧，本身佢一啲嘅行為守嗱，大律師公會咧本身有啲行為守則咧，就我哋每一位執業大律師咧都要去遵守嘅。咁但係係咪一有投訴咧，就已經生效，就已經咧係要擺喺嗰個證書嗰度，就令到你咧係冇辦法攞到呢張證書，或者唔符合咧，又未必。

57
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:38,000
嘅，因為咧，首先咧，你就即係一有一個投訴人啦，就去誒瞭解翻件事啦，就要填表格啊，或者去作出投訴啦。咁跟住咧，其實可能有兩條路走喎。一條路咧就係但當然要調查翻啦，就係睇下咧係咪可能構成專業操守失當啦。呢一個咧係好重要喎。

58
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,820
hello。

59
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,770
冇咁重要。

60
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,040
And then we've got.

61
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,420
律師局長。

62
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,600
The Mr. Rimsky Yoon here.

63
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,870
可以問政府去追訴啊！呢一樣嘢絕對不合理，所以我反對。

64
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:01,420
誒，我唔係hello嘅，你中意hello，因為我唔中意。你可唔可以稱呼即係？

65
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:36,410
我

66
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:29,970
去發言，亦都完全係剝奪咗司長、局長、官員就住呢一個修訂去作出一啲陳述、解釋或者係一啲承諾。

67
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:52,300
Of the matter, and according to the electoral calendar, the solicitor general is supposed to be here too. Sir, can I ask, where's the solicitor general? Is he going to be here at all?

68
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:19,750
This is a most curious affair. I mean, we're going through some harmless procedure in this chamber. We're asked to take note of some subsidiary legislation. It's negative vetting too.

69
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:58,010
同埋去到乜嘢層次啦？因為有一啲嘅層次，佢認為需要嘅話咧，先至會去到咧今次修訂所謂嘅上，就係話頭先我講嘅係呢個紀律審裁組，又或者咧係會作出聆訊。因為咧，陳素莊議員，係請你停一停。誒，我留意到咧，誒代理主席。

70
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:18,020
先講咗咧，而家依一個係中止議案嚟嘅，咁所以你唔應該去詳細討論啊。依個拆息嘅議案，請你翻返嚟。我一路都喺度啊，主席。頭先我特登講，不過可能你啱啱換位啦。咁咧就誒，阿主席唔知頭先有冇聽到我個親身經歷咧？咁所以咧就係呢一個咧，同呢個新。

71
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:38,030
生效日期咧係非常之有關嘅。咁但係咧，頭先正如我所講啦，嗰個生效日期嗱，呢個都直接同個措手有關。但係本來咧，可能咧呢一個申請人咧係唔需要提交呢一個證書嘅。但係如果生效咗嘅話，如果佢又有紀律凌訊嘅話咧，佢就可能會被影響咯。咁喺

72
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:58,040
喺呢一個階段，會唔會有一啲嘅聆訊係可能被拖延咗，又或者係特登早啲立案，令到呢一個人不能轉成為誒呢個律師咧？我哋唔知道。當然啦，我唔睇到咧有任何嘅原因、任何嘅理由咧，大律師公會要需要去誒就住某一兩三位嘅申請。

73
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:18,050
人咧去進行一啲嘅誒，即係拖延啊，或者誒刻意令到咧誒變成立案要作出調查，因為咧除咗去頭先我講嘅一個叫做申訴及誒操守誒言訊，即係嗰個嗰個我哋叫做嗰個誒審裁組之外咧，其實咧有一啲可能係比較冇咁複雜嗰啲。

74
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:38,060
咧，亦都咧，即係比較輕微嗰啲咧，就可以由咧誒大律師公會主席咧就自行處理。我相信誒誒，即係以往阿律政司司長咧都做過呢個大律師公會主席咧，亦都係誒，即係可能都處理過。咁誒誒，我亦都要講翻啦，都係好似上次一地兩檢討論嘅時候咧，當年咧阿阿袁國強司長咧。

75
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:58,070
咧都提醒過本人嘅，因為咧可能咧當時咧有好多人咧就關注，即係可能喺好多媒體度見到我，咁咧就有機會咧呢啲人咧可能成為我嘅投訴人。而如果呢一個投訴成立，又去咗審裁嗰邊嘅話咧，咁可能就算我救咗五年咧，我都未必轉得到可以避免咗唔使做實習律。

76
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:18,080
是喎，我可能都要繼續去實習嘅喎。咁本來要實習幾耐咧，就係兩年。究竟我可唔可以有豁免咧？呢個就真係唔知道啦。噉啊，所以咧喺呢一個生效嘅日期當中咧，其實相當緊要。當然啦，頭先我亦都要講翻畀阿主席聽啦。我其實從來都喺度，因為呢一個生效日期究竟生效緊啲乜嘢咧？唔係由零開。

77
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:38,090
好似突然間有條條例，突然間pop一聲話生效喎。我哋講緊係一啲修定咗嘅嘢生效，所以咧就有一個咧係一個過程啦。即係話咧，如果生效之前嘅咧就仲未需要嘅，噉就仲行跟緊舊制。但係如果生效嘅話咧，就即刻跟新制啦。咁所以咧喺呢一個過渡期咧係非常之重。

78
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:58,100
要嘅，咁所以今次咧呢一個終止代續咧，我覺得係唔應該。雖然我理解，好似係主席話齋，我哋今次只不過係測試，但係主席我都要再重複，因為如果今次終止代續會通過，真係好明顯啦。大家都咁乖乖坐咗喺度嘅話咧，今次呢一件事咧，如果終止。

79
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:18,110
代續被通過嘅話咧，袁國強司長咧又係冇機會就住呢一個修訂咧，或者係生效日期咧，發表過任何嘅意見嘅呢一樣嘢。唔係我講緊佢有長篇大論，但係今次嘅終止代續不單止黐奪咗我哋作為議員去就住呢一個修訂規則。

80
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:50,260
因為我哋已經講緊啦，有好多嘅可能改善嘅地方啊，或者甚至有好多其他嘅意見。今次係噉，下次都可以係噉。今日都已經用過兩次啦，主席呢個咪就係話畀你聽。其實以後我哋講嘢又被剝奪，跟住官員又唔使回答，噉我哋以後作為市民嘅，我哋可以點樣睇到透明度啊？我哋點樣可以？

81
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,020
粗魯。

82
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,310
我個人的思考，喺呢個問題。

83
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,950
他唔係喺度，當那件事被提起。

84
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,380
Adjustment motion，what's the whole purpose？What's the point？

85
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:09,510
Where's the solicitor general？政府委派邊一個官員嚟咧？係政府嘅決定嘅。

86
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:22,340
this is you know the it's just improper it's very very improper when he was needed he was absent but with this

87
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:24,370
The fact that the secretary for justice is here for this very minor, as far as I could see, very minor motion.

88
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:12,380
But as a result, we can't talk back because we're quite baffled. We're all puzzled as to why he bothered to raise this 40 bracket one.

89
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:23,340
I know, but the fact that it's been put down on the electoral calendar tells you that he's supposed to be here, but he's not, and we have the secretary for justice here.

90
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:37,310
我係冇收到任何嘅。I read it clearly just now。而家總言之，我亦都講咗好清楚，政府委派邊位官員嚟咧？依個係政府嘅決定。請你繼續。

91
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:13,080
the script, the storyline is all known. They knew, we knew that they expected us to know. kind of story. How boring is it? How boring indeed. And

92
00:36:48,590 --> 00:37:06,510
This is just not right, and I personally would like to ask him about whatever happened to Article 20 of the Basic Law of his that supposed to be applicable to his colocation in West Kowloon.

93
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:37,010
Can we ask what's the point of the whole thing? Of course, you could say you can disagree. He just has the right to raise such a matter. Fine, okay. But I seriously still appreciate your.

94
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:57,600
Okay, it's curiosity on my part then. Right. Now, the proposer of this adjournment didn't use any improper language or any crude substance. That's very nice of him. Nothing indecent. Nothing.

95
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:57,770
decency expressed in the way you proposed the matter, unlike your colleague earlier in the day. But then the thing is, it's so expected still. It's so déjà vu. It's almost like some cheap detective movie.

96
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:45,050
I think it's very demeaning, and the fact that they raise this adjournment thing tells you that they couldn't care less if this top official in Hong Kong has the chance to reply to anything, or the chance to the opportunity to say any of his.

97
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,590
嗱。

98
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,140
我。

99
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,540
The main difference.

100
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,070
No, I'm quite.

101
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,010
Curious too about the.

102
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,590
Small lawyers, no, nobody called them small lawyers, but people got the.

103
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,820
what for? I'm not too sure. The proposer didn't quite say it.

104
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:32,770
我我我just don't see why he should be here at this hour to listen to this adjournment proposal debate.

105
00:37:47,810 --> 00:38:07,820
Well, I'm speaking as a layman. Of course, I'm not a member of the legal profession. But then, there's always this misunderstanding, especially in Hong Kong, that barristers and solicitors come in two rankings. That's completely wrong. We knew.

106
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:27,830
That right, barristers are supposed to represent his client in court. They get more limelight, I suppose you can say, and they're better known. Like in Hong Kong, the number one senior counsel, of course, the top barrister is Martin.

107
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:47,840
Martin Lee, everyone in Hong Kong knew Martin Lee. But then solicitors are equally important. They surely are of equal importance, because more often than not, the barristers are actually advised by the solicitors. Although the barristers

108
00:38:47,840 --> 00:39:07,850
The barrister, say, in charge of the case, would sort of shape and structure his client's views into views of events rather into legal arguments, and try to make sort of persuasive representations in court. In

109
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:27,860
the best interest of his client, that sort of things. But in solicitors, do just as much, although they are not as much in the public eye. That's all. But very curious in Hong Kong, barristers are called big lawyer, or as though were solicitors.

110
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:53,100
wrong impression that barristers are somehow sort of above. It's not quite right. It's just two different categories of legal service specialists. And if you are very keen about American legal dramas, you would.

111
00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:13,110
Have seen or come across the term 'counselor', counselor, right? It's representative of all lawyers, unlike what we have in Hong Kong. But of course, everyone knew in Hong Kong we inherit TET, the UK system. That's

112
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:44,400
A barrister thing would trying to sort of turn himself into a solicitor instead, and some people would think, why should any barrister do that at all? That's almost like a self demotion. No, no, no. There's no such thing. It's not a demotion.

113
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,110
啊。

114
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,340
They were chatting.

115
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,910
我唔係 rambling on。

116
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:56,660
I think it's January eighth. It says, yeah, when it's going to take effect.

117
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:52,130
yes，而家依個咧就係誒宗子代續嘅，而講嘅咧就係。

118
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:49,180
立法，which is now under negative vetting. I have no problem with the date of its.

119
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:37,750
Behind me, please could you stop chatting? It is very distracting. Please, please, thank you. Now.

120
00:40:52,980 --> 00:41:03,810
二零一七年實習律師修訂規則嘅生效日期公告。咁所以唔該，你翻翻嚟呢個。

121
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:09,500
I mean, as a member, as as a non-member of the legal profession, I seriously can't comment either way. But then to come back to this.

122
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:29,220
我係想講，我其實計劃講關於這個修訂案，因為我理解到有個小障礙，或者小阻礙，就是律師面對。

123
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:49,230
Possible potential ethics hearings. Now that's one thing I'm not too sure about as a layman. Say if I were a barrister, and then my client somehow complained against me, and he made the verbal complaint, he hasn't even filled out the form, and

124
00:41:49,230 --> 00:42:09,240
In between that sort of happenings, what's going to happen to my intention to try to be exempted from all these training requirements as a solicitor? 我諗你而家講嘅係離題離開得好遠啊！請你翻返嚟，請你翻返嚟。

125
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:29,250
個辯論，如果你嚟得太遠嘅，我唯有係中止你嘅發言。Okay, so I will try to raise my point number two. What I initially would want to talk about now, I wasn't, I don't have much problem with this amendment thing anyway. Now, guys.

126
00:42:41,040 --> 00:43:01,050
Now, I was going to talk about this trainee solicitor because it does have these two words in there. I have this young friend of mine who completed with flying colours from Hong Kong University a legal degree, and he was a trainee solicitor. And I was going to raise.

127
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:21,060
to the secretary for justice that young people as trainee solicitors are suffering a lot that they're not doing real legal work but as copy boys really if there's any translation or typing typographical mistakes or

128
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:41,070
They are asked to do xeroxing duties. This is just not right. The young man was very, very disheartened. So I was going to say all that, but then you were saying you're not, you're not, you shouldn't go into details of this subsidy.

129
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,400
啊， discussions.

130
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,530
adjournment proposal.

131
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,370
因為它係twice in a day now。

132
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,840
It's just no good because it's farcical to start with, farcical.

133
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:54,420
what's so ungood about this adjournment debate, or this adjournment proposal?

134
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:32,690
First, the pros and cons. The pros is that, I suppose, they think it's going to save time.

135
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:29,010
We can't do that, right? It's it's not a matter of time. Although although in politics we always say time is always on the people's side.

136
00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:05,580
Chamber of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, we have government executive officials sitting there listening to this sort of

137
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:22,210
It is a sad thing, don't you think? So to consider whether I should agree with this adjournment motion, I need to consider.

138
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:17,680
If we're just talking about saving time, we might as well call it a day. Now you could declare this meeting adjourned over until next week. Let's save more time.

139
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:47,890
In some ways, it's going to save time. Never mind, whatever the government proposes says on paper, it must be just like the gospel. It's just wonderful. Let's just get it passed.

140
00:45:48,190 --> 00:46:03,860
passage of this is all expected, and please don't spend one more second on this. That's the attitude. But saving time is time really a matter, an issue here.

141
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:21,110
I mean, mostly, most of the time we would laugh at something that happens twice, as in many days, meaning twice in two days, right? But no, it's twice within one day by the same gang of people.

142
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:46,100
So, I disagree with this saving time business. And but what about the cons? What's so ungood, if there's such a word? I think so. These days online, you can make up English words very liberally.

143
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:33,960
It's a sad thing, isn't it? It's almost like a circus here that the tamed or domesticated animals would be playing their parts, each and every one of them. And the script, the storyline is so known already.

144
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:54,020
And we should just cut out our proper debating time and so on. It doesn't matter what official is sitting there. Not that we must show them respect. I'm not saying that. But they are our guests anyway. This is the.

145
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,490
It's all, really.

146
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,350
domesticated pets.

147
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,680
of this legislative council.

148
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,490
And I don't know what.

149
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,720
對呢一個拆息咧，作一次嘅發言。

150
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,450
我今日懷疑埋咧，機器都係你嘅人啊！

151
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,220
pets， this morning I used the word groffler， groffling。

152
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,950
嗱，我哋成日話呢排都話啦，求元、求精、足種都係你嘅人。

153
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:28,810
It's all expected, and it's whatever's going to happen to the general public's impression.

154
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:29,700
coming from they say oohs anti-feeling bustering without telling you, without saying it, but it's all understood bollocks.

155
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:45,420
very cheap kind of playing politics, and I really, really feel sad. Not just for this council, but for Hong Kong. 你馬上停止發言，趁支傳議員。

156
00:48:47,100 --> 00:49:01,370
我係反對盧偉國議員根據四十括弧一提出，針對今日呢一條二零一七年實習律師修訂規則生效日期公告所提出嘅終止待續議案嘅。

157
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:48,500
already，people are saying that，it's not just a circus，it's a zoo，but a zoo full of domesticated animals，or maybe not animals，because some animals are still wild。

158
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:41,190
咁當然，因為啊盧偉國議員就撳咗第二次啦，即係佢排到第二位啦。其他議員咧，如果呢條誒終止代罪過咗咧，就不能夠好似主席你咁講，針對咧具體內容咧去發言啦。

159
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:21,780
those Beijing loyalists, the shoe shiners, are trying to get at, or trying to take Hong Kong people to. I don't know exactly what this is going to achieve. So at the end of the day, I I do not understand where that is.

160
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:21,710
不過，首先咧，我要多謝梁美芬議員。梁美芬議員作為有關附屬法例嘅小組委員會主席咧，其實如果建制派要做得絕啲咧，佢頭先發言報告嘅時候咧，可以連除做埋四十括回一嘅。如果佢做埋嘅話咧，就連楊嶽橋議員都唔可以針。

161
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,230
哈哈哈！

162
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,580
其實政府係應該反對嘅。

163
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,300
陳志全議員，請你繼續。

164
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,020
我都要鼓掌，甘拜下風。

165
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,300
咧嗱，按政府嘅慣例咧。

166
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,980
好，主席，言歸正傳。

167
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:17,170
唔係，噉我要問下楊樂橋，唔知彈乜嘢嘅，仲快過你啦。

168
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,410
但係按政府嘅慣例，議員提四十括弧一咧。

169
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:52,970
政府自己提就冇得講啦，好似上次一地兩檢噉，佢自己提四十，佢回一，噉就梗係自己支持翻自己啦。

170
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:53,690
個機機器都係秘書處操作嘅。你講就得啦。嗱，機器秘書處操作嘅自有公論。

171
00:49:53,340 --> 00:50:00,720
頭先咧，上一場咧，盧阿黃國健議員咧，又係撳到第二嘅，即係話咧。

172
00:50:54,290 --> 00:51:05,010
係啊！啊，陳志全咁講法咧，雖然話講機器，其實間接咧好似係對我有所懷疑。主席我手快，因為我自細彈琵琶，我嘥好快。

173
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:26,040
都撳輸畀羅偉國，你話係咪我有權猜測個機器嘅動機啊？即係我我猜測議員嘅動機就唔得，我猜測機器嘅可能機器都唔想我哋講啊！即係陳志全、陳志揚，請停一停。

174
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:13,100
阿陶謹申講完咧，阿王國健你咁多第二，咁呢個當然我哋就冇準備啊！但係呢場唔同，我一直擺住隻手指喺個掣度撳撳撳撳撳撳撳撳撳，都撳輸。

175
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:46,330
嗱，我希望你咧就係誒小心啲。你對建制派嘅批評或者對我批評咧都接受嘅，但係請你咧就對我哋秘書處嘅中立性咧，我唔係話秘書處啊，我懷疑架機器有事啊，主席，機器要驗機器。

176
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:42,290
我多多謝袁良美分議員咧。我想多謝袁國強司長，因為有傳聞咧，就話司長咧做到年尾就可能唔做啦噉樣。咁咧，政府而家冇排法案上嚟啦，咁所以咧，可能我哋呢轉咧都係差唔多係臨別見啊，司長啦。我想講點解同今次有關。

177
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:21,810
嗯。

178
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,160
主席。

179
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,890
因為咧。

180
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,220
所以佢就話咧。

181
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,670
我又冇抄佢之前嗰節講嗰啲喎，真係。

182
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,690
就怕講多錯多啊！

183
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,870
內個議員頭先咧，佢開始發言嘅時候咧，佢話。

184
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,670
誒，二零一七年實習律師修訂規則生效日期公告嘅實體辯論。

185
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:31,660
如果司長你係準備有講稿，準備喺拆息裏邊去發言嘅話，我覺得你係應該反對呢個四十括一。

186
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:09,710
我唔知正方反方會唔會好多人發言啦，先至去作出呢個明智嘅決定，係咪反對四十括弧一，畀我哋進入去呢一個？

187
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:42,390
你係應該聽下，今日有幾多議員係針對呢一條二零一七年實習律師修訂規則生效日期公告？

188
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:30,410
噉啊，盧偉國議員咧就學精咗嘅嚇，即係精過啊黃國健議員。我諗住等佢講乜嘢啦，就叫啲同事抄定啦，即係講乜嘢？點知佢冇咩講嘅嚇。

189
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:12,590
即係你為免講多錯多，跟住仲要保底喎，保底就話啊，唔係對咩律師啊，或者呢條法例有咩不敬啊，唔唔尊重啊，唔想畀佢即係討論啊，只不過喺個程序處理噉樣啊。

190
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:53,750
之前嗰節佢又講咗㗎啦。嗱，之前嗰節講咗，即係佢唔理今次呢個實體係乜嘢㗎啦。所以之前嗰節佢話，黃國健議員又講得好清楚啦。之前嗰節佢臨尾點解要撳鐘咧？就係佢因為要講定先，講咗就唔使入到呢節再講。

191
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:59,200
想去講啲乜嘢畀你聽，聽完呢啲意見，如果你有一啲回應，係應該趁呢個機會去做嘅。何況咧臨別，即係傳説嘅臨別，我應我係再一次希望師長咧，聽完我哋。

192
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:21,370
因為政府已經準備咗就議程就議案派咗官員嚟到立法會，甚至乎可能可能準備咗講講稿嘅。除非你又話夾埋唔使講稿啦，啊唔使寫定啦，因為實係四十個回一過到嘅。阿盧偉國議員又話畀你聽：，我一早諗住提四十個回一啦，噉你又冇講稿啦，否則。

193
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,980
令到。

194
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,780
如果法例或者附屬法例，

195
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,410
因為我哋而家處理緊呢個咧，叫拆息。

196
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,960
呢一個制衡監察嘅作用，因為。

197
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,810
唔係辯論，唔係辯論嘅生效日期。

198
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,350
議會其中一個好重要嘅精神，就係制衡同埋監察政府。

199
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,580
唔係有輸有贏嚇，冇輸冇贏都唔使投票嘅。

200
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:55,110
提出嘅中止代續咧，都係基於議會精神，希望監察同制約政府。

201
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:24,780
誒，即係呢個辯論冇乜意思啊！噉佢一講呢句咧，我就覺得佢根本都唔理解而家我哋處理緊乜嘢。

202
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:08,220
主席，我反對呢一個宗旨有幾大原因？第一係違反議會精神。

203
00:54:53,580 --> 00:55:00,750
你可以話一個温馨提示，亦都係話一個展述，係想畀政府知道啫，唔係一個辯論嚟嘅。

204
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:22,160
我哋過去喺法例嗰陣時動以四十括弧一去終止嗰個法例或者議案咧，就係要發揮。

205
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:20,590
如果今日成功終止咗呢個拆式嘅議案，唔會導致呢個條例呢個令嘅生效日期公告唔能夠實施。

206
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:09,140
議會應有嘅功能咧係彰顯，但係今日盧偉國議員或者上一場黃國健議員提出嘅終止代續咧，係違反議會精神，係削弱議會功能。

207
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:53,300
拆息嘅過程只不過係畀議員喺呢個生效令生效之前，佢嘅生效日期就係出年嘅一月八號啦。如果有啲咩關注，有咩疑慮，都係提出嚟。

208
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:49,250
係被中止代續嘅話，就可以令到法例暫緩實施。政府為咗要令議會再次通過呢一個法例或者附屬法例，就有可能同立法會咧係妥協改善相關嘅法例。因此，我哋就法例同附屬法例，甚至政府一地兩檢議案。

209
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,090
雖然今日，

210
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,890
你哋係咁講，你哋誤會咗啦。

211
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,020
我有解釋嘅，你聽埋先。

212
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,320
對議會嘅精神係全無認識。

213
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,510
嗱，我唔知其他人點諗，我就唔會。

214
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:25,030
特顯呢名提出終止代續議員，即係盧偉國議員。

215
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,090
想延燒幾個鐘頭，先至去提出。你哋係拖時間。

216
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:01,010
自己提呢個四十個回一咧，嗰個客觀效果係咩咧？就係封殺建制派，唔畀佢哋講。

217
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,080
完之後，又彈一個起身咧，提中止待續，跟住又重複，又講多二十幾次。

218
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:04,180
呢個條例涉及律師會運作，但係議員仍然有監察呢個專業組織嘅新規則嘅責任。

219
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:19,900
今日提出呢個終止代續嘅議員，即係盧偉國，係以議員嘅身份剝奪咗呢個議會就呢個專業組織一啲新規則反映問題、反映意見、發揮議會監察職能嘅最後機會。

220
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:36,850
呢個律師會嘅規則修訂令仍然會喺出年嘅一月八號生效，因此佢唔會達至我哋早前多次就法例或者附屬法例提出終止代續嗰個效果。今次呢個終止代續，佢唯一一個功能。

221
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:54,270
就係令到議員唔能夠就住呢個公告去發言，唔能夠進入呢個實體去辯論，呢個終止代續係故意削弱議員就呢個律師會新規則發言嘅最後機會。

222
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:49,280
今日嘅終止代續係違反言論自由。大家可以留意到，之前我哋提出嘅終止代續咧，無論係一地兩檢又好法例或者附屬法例又好咧，我哋咧都會等到有一定嘅議員發言之後咧，先提出㗎。噉你哋咧就會話啦，係咯，你哋就。

223
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:18,960
其實等多啲議員去發言之後，先至提出呢個終止待續咧。佢嘅好處就係畀議員有機會表達嘅機會，唔係一開始就落閘，唔畀議員發言。所以有啲人話嗱，今次點解我要提終止待續咧？就係要防你哋，防你哋咧二十幾個講完。

224
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:55,140
因為呢一個策呢係個測試嚟嘅，唔係一個辯論，亦都冇約束力，亦都唔會令到任何嘢去改變，即係唔會好似我哋之前嗰個誒話誒可以逼到政府去加嗰啲種換誒嗰啲誒發換嗰啲錢。如果我哋講完之後就。

225
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,400
又繼續。

226
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,500
多謝主席。

227
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,900
但係。

228
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,360
十分有趣。

229
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,080
層次傳言。

230
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,250
Can we have the quorum, please?

231
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,120
呢個就係我哋嘅言論自由嘅可貴。

232
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:49,130
今日咧就係唔畀你講，你冇個琵琶手咁快撳得到，所以你就冇得講。客觀效果就係噉。

233
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:25,030
另一個我反對盧偉國議員提出四十括弧一嘅理由，就係如果四十括弧一通過咗，就會令到議員唔能夠履行職責。

234
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:20,410
根據實習律師合約受僱前，需要從香港大律師公會執行委員會取得證明書。嗱，呢個係大個大精神，我都希望可以講一次。畀咧，務問政員。

235
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:29,400
但係今日建制派就係把持咗功能組別同埋地區直選都係過半嘅情況之下，喺只有一個議員發言就話呢個係程序處理，就提出中止代續，就唔畀我哋進入去實體嘅辯論。

236
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:18,080
唔畀佢哋進入個實體主體去講，咁呢個對我嚟講咧，我覺得係不道德，同埋違反咧我自己天字一號嘅精神，就係嗰個言論自由。所以我就話：你哋如果喺咩位出嚟踴躍發言咧，我都唔會有半句怨言嘅。

237
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:48,050
主席，你雖然喺你嘅發言稿嗰度，代主席係講話唔可以就呢項附屬法例嘅具體內容，包括實施日期同埋有關大律師申請成為律師需符合嘅規則，去長篇大論。但係今日咧，我相信一般嘅市民咧係唔知道啊。

238
00:59:51,890 --> 01:00:10,080
議會理應係最有言論自由嘅地方，我哋甚至乎有權力及特權條例嘅保護，係可以暢所欲言，係免受刑責。議會甚至好似主席講，可以講同事實不符嘅嘢都可以發言。

239
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:40,190
今日建制派兩次喺議議案開始嘅時候就提出中止待續，呢個做法同我哋過去嘅差異。希望各位觀眾、各位市民睇到，我哋係畀大家講講講講講曬，講到你唔講咧，先至提中止，就係畀大家去針對一條議案去發言。但係建制派。

240
01:00:48,330 --> 01:01:08,340
而家我哋畀人中止咗嗰嚿嘢，係乜嘢嚟都唔知道。嗰嚿嘢唔係話係一月八號要實施一啲嘢，噉佢實施啲乜嘢嘢啊？點解你要唔畀人講啊？佢實施就係話取消大律師資格嘅大律師，如果希望成為律師，喺向律師會申請豁免。

241
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,380
問題。

242
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,410
喂。

243
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,520
就唔可以有意見咧？

244
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,950
今日終止代續嘅後果就係。

245
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:21,670
令到我哋嚇唔能夠。

246
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:45,980
反映問題嘅基本權利。

247
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:48,150
噉係咪即係調翻轉講冇加入到嗰個法案委員會？

248
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:47,100
如果發現多啲問題，就有責任把握機會喺議會嗰度反映。

249
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:58,870
我見到呢個能源效益標籤嘅時候，大家起身講嚇，好多議員起身講，佢哋都冇加入。

250
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:57,880
另外，可唔可以？我冇入到委員會，但係後來有市民向我反映意見。市民話都希望喺最後機會向政府提出咧。

251
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:13,250
咁冇入委員會嘅嘅議員係咪就唔能夠暢所欲言咧？呢個邏輯係好大問題。我希望大家即係以後唔好用呢呢把尺去講一啲喺任何階段有意見嘅議員。

252
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:41,700
大家可能質疑，或者頭先羅偉國議員都有講嘅，即係如果對一個課題、一個法例，無論係附屬法例好係誒法例好，如果有好強烈嘅意見，應該加入小組。

253
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:19,160
呢個小組嘅呢個又係雙重標準，即係你做就得，人哋做就話冇加入小組。即係如果咧呢個係成立咧，以後就所有法案都要開委員會附屬法例好生效日期好，跟住所有議員都要加曬入去。如果唔加入去嘅話咧，你就冇發言權，你就畀人質疑。

254
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:40,700
其實一個議員喺任何時間、任何階段，都應該可以針對某一個法例，即使好似呢個噉嘅冇能力改變佢，即使淨只得擦色嘅機會，都可以表達意見。無論條條文係幾咁簡單，亦都可以喺任何時間，你會發現到一啲新。

255
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:42,150
喺呢個機會，最後機會嚇，即使有市民向我哋反映咗意見，嚇想我哋趁機會講畀政府聽，政府亦嚟到坐定定想聽，但係就唔準講，冇得講。呢個就係剝奪咗議員履行喺議會反映民意。

256
01:05:46,460 --> 01:06:06,470
我要向我啲同事咧講聲唔好意思，其實咧頭先啲附屬法例又好啦，呢一part又好啦，我都準備咗好長盡嘅資料，係希望咧可以喺大會上邊咧係畀政府聽到，但係因為上一個被通過啊，中止待續，呢一個如無意外。

257
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:19,910
我現又宣佈，本會於二零一七年十二月六日星期三上午十一時續會。

258
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:13,850
又會通過，所以咧議員咧所做嘅準備功夫咧係付諸流水，呢個先至係浪費資源。
