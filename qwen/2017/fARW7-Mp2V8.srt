1
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
需要。

2
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,610
三分鐘。

3
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,400
孩子所需嘅情感同埋物質。

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,270
推廣兒童健康、爭取兒童權利同埋公眾教育嘅使命。

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,400
香港兒科基金會嘅誒周富堅。

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,590
醫護人員、兒童工作者同埋社會賢達，香港兒科基金肩負起。

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,440
誒有尋求庇護嘅家庭，佢哋嚟到呢度陳述，可能都唔簡單，亦都有。

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:30,070
即係有好多好遠，同埋要付起啲交通費各方面嘅，咁多謝大家。咁跟住落嚟咧，我哋都想繼續請啲。

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:39,540
誒朋友嚟到公聽會咧，係首先表達咗先，然後我哋再請政府回應，包括埋第一節嗰啲嘅問題嘅。

10
00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:03,660
通過舉辦多元化嘅活動，去推廣去推廣一啲兒童健康成長同埋發展，並且以建立兒童醫院、制定兒童健康政策同埋成立兒童事務專業為目標。

11
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:42,200
主席，各位早晨，我係香港兒科基金健康大使周富堅。香港兒科基金係一個非牟利嘅專業團體，創立於一九九四年，直屬香港兒科醫學會，成員包括兒科醫生。

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,500
翻嚟啦！我哋誒恢復第二節嚇，多謝咁多位同事，星期六朝早同埋咁多位與會者，尤其是一啲小朋友，誒，亦都有一啲誒貧窮嘅家庭，包括咗。

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:59,830
咁嚟嘅誒，今日嘅表述嘅人士咧，請大家留意咧，你哋嘅發言咧係唔受到立法會嘅權力及特權條例保障，即係言責自負。誒，但係當然係暢所欲言嘅。咁希望大家把握三分鐘，儘量喺呢個時間咧完成你嘅。

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:19,840
表述，因為我哋都真係需要時間咧。請誒政府官員回應大家嘅訴求，同埋誒議員嘅質詢嘅。咁如果唔夠時間咧，其實我哋就變咗誒聽唔到政府嗰個誒回應啦。噉我哋首先咧就請。

15
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,270
學生近三倍。

16
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,010
我任何嘅牙科檢查嘅。

17
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,450
就住以上嘅問題，我哋有以下嘅建議。

18
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,390
但係，呢啲政策係咪能夠足夠同埋有效噉樣改善本港兒童嘅問題咧？

19
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,480
兒童係有自卑感，對自己缺乏信心，縱緩兒童係有較多嘅社交焦慮嘅。

20
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:14,400
由於誒呢個診費非常之貴，所以咧家長係都唔會帶佢哋去睇牙醫，咁令到佢哋嘅牙齒健康有更大嘅問題。除此之外，

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:03:01,240
而而家香港嘅政府針對兒童貧窮嘅政策咧，係推出咗喺近期施政報告裏面咧，有喺明年中成立嘅兒童事務委員會，同埋近年推出嘅兒童發展基金。

22
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:45,100
依啊，以上就係我嘅誒發言，多謝主席。好，唔該曬啊，周富堅，如果你嘅發言有誒文稿嘅話，都希望你可以帶埋上嚟。各位與會者都係，跟住請周萬思。

23
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:22,160
貧窮對兒童嘅健康有好深遠嘅影響。今日我今日我哋會講四方面，包括係生理、心理、教育同埋社交。而我主要集中喺生理嘅影響方面。喺身體健康方面，我哋就以兒童嘅脊骨為例。

24
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:31,060
兒童嘅腦部發展為例啦，喺一五年嘅《自然神經科學雜誌》裏面提到，有研究過超過一千名嘅兒童，發現咧低收入嘅父母咧，佢哋嘅兒童咧大腦嘅表現嘅皮層係比較少嘅，咁會嚴重影響咗佢哋嘅語言發展，影響咗佢哋以後學習嘅能力。

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:24,210
咩叫兒童貧窮咧？貧兒童貧窮唔單止係指兒童生活係一個低收入、低消費力、惡劣嘅居住環境，同埋缺乏學習機會，同埋薄弱嘅社交網絡嘅情況之下，更加要包括兒童因為貧窮而所感受到嘅被剝削感。例如喺家長喺成兒童成長過程之中冇冇辦法提供。

26
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:48,500
根據香港嘅貧窮狀況報告所指，喺一五年有一共十八萬名嘅兒童生活喺貧困之中。現時香港嘅兒童貧困率係十八個percent，遠比其他較發達嘅誒經濟體係相比，香港嘅兒童貧困率係比較高嘅。喺丹麥嚟講有三點七個percent，喺英國有九點八個percent。

27
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:42,660
香港社區組織聯會、香港兒童權利關注會同埋香港脊骨神經科醫學會基金會為例，佢哋喺就兒童貧窮居嘅居住環境同埋脊骨健康進行咗一項調查，發現有唔少嘅居住劏房嘅兒童，佢哋嘅脊骨都出現咗問題。有近八成嘅兒童係冇固定嘅書台同埋温習嘅地方嘅。

28
00:03:43,310 --> 00:04:03,320
香港佢哋嘅環境，直接影響咗佢哋嘅學術同埋同埋身心健康。另外喺兒童牙齒方面為例，香港小童羣妖嘅研究裏面發現，有二十四個percent嘅貧窮兒童有唔健康牙齒。喺社區組織聯會嘅貧窮兒童健康調查入面，有七成嘅受訪兒童，除咗小童嘅牙科保養之外咧，佢哋冇接受。

29
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,110
我十分贊成。

30
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,960
田六秀娟。

31
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,550
主席，大家好。

32
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,540
誒，我係一個退休嘅兒科護士。

33
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,660
其實用埋跨國別、跨界別。

34
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,660
其實以今日香港嘅環境，我哋嘅經濟情況。

35
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,200
機會去生活、學習同埋享受平等嘅權利。

36
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,200
其實係可以結合社區、家庭、政府同埋各方面嘅資源。

37
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,440
政府其實係刻不容緩，要關顧呢啲小孩子嘅權益。

38
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:16,460
貧窮嘅細路仔亦都一樣，佢哋應該得到一般細路仔嘅同等嘅照顧同埋支援。

39
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:04,360
其實大家都知道啦，誒，每一個人、每一個細路仔，唔同性別、社會背景同埋種族，其實都應該大家有同等嘅。

40
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:52,570
頭先嗰兩位青年人，啊，佢哋就住香港兒科基金對貧窮兒童健康喺四方面嘅表述。

41
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:15,160
同嘅學習需要，透過兒童發展基金支援補習同埋課外活動嘅費用，令到佢哋可以提升學習能力同埋競爭力，亦都可以提供獎學金同埋減免佢哋嘅學費，令到一班清貧嘅學生有教育嘅機會。

42
00:04:45,570 --> 00:05:05,580
主席，各位早晨。誒，我係香港兒科基金嘅健康大使周曼斯。咁頭先，我哋發表咗貧窮對於兒童嚟講嘅生理方面嘅誒負面影響啦。噉我嚟緊咧就會講下其他方面嘅影響，同埋就住以上嘅問題咧，係作出一啲提議嘅。咁喺心理健康方面咧，香港社區組織。

43
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:25,590
協會咧調查發現，近六成嘅貧窮兒童咧係唔中意自己居住嘅地方嘅。五成嘅受訪兒童咧係有情緒嘅問題，咁學習同埋生活嘅動力咧亦都隨之而下降。兒童係正值喺成長嘅階段，如果長期處於情緒低落嘅話，絕對係會影響咗佢哋嘅身心成長。另外，

44
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:45,600
香港小童羣益會嘅調查發現，貧窮兒童係有自殺嘅念頭比一般嘅兒童為高，喺學習喺學業成績方面亦都比其他嘅兒童遜色嘅。喺社交發展上面，研究指出超過五成嘅縱緩兒童有負面嘅情緒，同埋有七成嘅受訪。

45
00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:12,860
喺教育方面，入讀大學嘅比率為例，香港教育大學做一做一項研究，發現過去二十年，香港大學嘅學額雖然有所增加，但係貧窮嘅貧富學生接受大學教育嘅機會差距越嚟越大。有錢嘅學生入讀大學嘅機會竟然高過貧窮嘅。

46
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:38,740
第一，加強護脊檢查同埋教育。而家衞生署喺小四嘅時候先會提供脊背嘅檢查。唔少兒童因為家居嘅問題喺年幼嘅時候已經出現咗脊骨嘅健康問題，所以我哋建議喺幼稚園、中學同埋小學為到學生同埋家長提供護脊嘅知識。

47
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:58,910
喺小一同埋小四嘅時候提供一啲脊骨嘅檢查。第二，為貧窮家庭推行家居改善計劃。第三，為佢哋為學童牙科保健計劃擴展去到幼稚園同埋中學。第四，設立兒童醫療券。第五，資助貧窮學。

48
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:35,570
另外，我哋希望可以幫佢哋擴展佢哋嘅視野，令到貧窮嘅兒童接觸到同埋瞭解到唔同嘅行業發展同埋前景、工作性質等等，為到佢哋嘅未來提供更多嘅選擇。以上就係兒科基金嘅意見，多謝。好唔該曬，周文思，跟住請。

49
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,010
小孩子係我哋嘅未來。

50
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,020
同埋有發展佢才能嘅空間同條件。

51
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,540
充滿希望同埋健康嘅成長環境。

52
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,450
我哋嘅未來嘅福祉，其實喺佢哋手上。我哋唔照顧佢。

53
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,940
促進佢哋長遠嘅發展。其實我哋真係要減少跨代貧窮。

54
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:45,460
同埋，我哋可以用嘅資源其實香港係好多嘅，要幫幫助呢啲弱勢社羣啲細路仔，替咗個開心。

55
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:16,190
父母要一日要長時間咁工作，佢哋點樣花時間同同佢嘅子女相處？點樣照顧佢子女咧？咁無疑對佢哋嘅小朋友、對基層兒童嚟講，係一種不平等嘅對待嚟。

56
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:47,920
因此，我哋確建議係政府係一要確保我哋教育入邊有充足嘅公營學校、公營學校同埋學額啦，滿足基層嘅住屋需要。啱啱有團體有提到好多劏房户嘅兒童其實脊骨好多問題咧，其實。

57
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:32,210
而且要確保佢哋喺唔同層面，包括教育、醫療啊、住屋、就業等嘅問題上邊咧，佢哋都係得唔會因為佢哋家庭背景同埋社會階層等嘅因素咧，令到佢失去安居樂業同埋可以一個自我實現嘅機會。

58
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:32,920
而其次喺政府提到好多關愛基金啦、攜手扶弱基金、兒童發展基金等等，佢哋入邊嘅項目對於兒童託管、課後支援，其實都係一啲短期甚至一啲實驗性嘅項目嚟嘅，而且名額係相當有限，成效係令人不禁係質疑。

59
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:25,030
大家點諗？呢個係我嘅睇法。多謝大家。好，唔該曬田綠秀娟，跟住請左翼廿一嘅謝俊賢。係多謝主席。係大家，我係在屆成員謝俊賢。誒，咁首先想就翻呢個議題講一講啲背景資料嘅，就係二零一五年嘅香港貧窮情況報告變改。

60
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:45,040
十八歲以下嘅兒童貧窮人口係去到十八萬人嘅，比整體貧窮率都係高。由此可見，其實貧兒童貧窮嘅問題已經係十分嚴重。但係睇而家今日立法誒會議文件入面睇咧，政府而家嘅政策咧睇嚟就係冇辦法有效咁解決以上問題。首先睇翻羅福嘅個文件咧，就係。

61
00:09:45,040 --> 00:10:05,050
低收入在職家庭津貼咧，其實佢同工時嘅掛鈎，其實美其名咧就係鼓勵多勞多得，其實就係鼓勵加班。兒童權利公約入邊嘅序言期已經提到咧，誒，我哋應該讓兒童喺家庭環境入邊啦，喺幸福、親愛同諒解嘅氣氛入邊成長。但係，試問若然一個基層嘅父

62
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,820
造成一個負面影響。

63
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:24,170
Thank you, Chairman, for giving me this opportunity to speak on what is a very important issue. At Dalyho and Associates, our firm has a sizeable portion of clients who belong to households with children living substantially below the poverty line. So

64
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:40,800
With that, a good number of those belong to ethnic minority backgrounds, and so I want to take the opportunity to address the committee as to why it is absolutely critical that the government adopts a holistic poverty reduction strategy that takes into account the needs for assimilation of ethnic minority children.

65
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:58,380
By way of overview, child poverty in ethnic minority households is on the rise and dramatically so. It's increased from 23.7% to 32.5% across 10 years. And so, especially for South Asian families, child poverty rate is double that of the local population.

66
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:53,370
因此對我我哋左翼界嚟講，誒總結嚟講咧，基層兒童其實不論喺經濟資本、社會資本、文化資本，講緊嘅係佢哋除咗基層家庭已經係經濟能力比一般家庭弱啦，佢哋嘅小朋友喺社交人物上邊啦、一啲文化知識上邊咧，其實已經相對比其他。

67
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:13,380
階層更加兒童更加貴乏嘅佢哋係好難向上流動，或者好難去得到一個體面生活。單靠一個短期救濟式嘅金錢資助，其實係治標不治本。因此，如果要真係認真解決一個跨代貧窮嘅問題咧，左翼解人認為我哋係要充分給予基層兒童係有尊嚴噉樣生活。

68
00:11:48,200 --> 00:12:08,210
試問佢哋住喺一個劏房，佢哋根本就學習空間或者參加啲課外活動嘅空間都冇，所以其實政府應該要滿足正基本組需要，係要大量提供更加嘅公屋喺醫療方面咧，政府喺一個龐大營員底下咧，仍然係要去加呢個誒急症室嘅收費咧，誒。

69
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:28,220
真係唔係好引導，而而且其實對呢個收費，其實對一個基層家庭嚟講已經係好多，所以除咗此之外，仲要防止一個大財團壟斷啦。相信政府喺擁有咁龐大嘅財政資源底下咧，係相信可以做得更多。多謝主席。好，唔該曬謝俊賢，跟住請民建聯。

70
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:48,230
嘅方純恩，多謝主席，大家好，我係民建聯社區幹事方純恩。根據二零一五年香港嘅貧窮情況報告，貧窮嘅兒童人口大約係二十三萬五千一百人，佔據嗰個年齡裏邊嘅左別嘅二十三點二個percent。政府政策介入之後，而家嘅貧窮人口大約減為十八萬二千。

71
00:12:48,230 --> 00:13:08,240
三百人比率係下降到去十八percent。雖然喺一二年之後有輕微嘅下跌，不過兒童嘅貧窮比率依然非常之嚴重。如果政府喺加入前能夠做一啲評估，就係每四個兒童裏邊就有一個生活喺貧窮線之下。雖然而家政府為兒童提供咗各項基本嘅社會福利。

72
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:28,250
但係依然有一班弱勢社羣嘅兒童，佢哋唔能夠得到政府應有嘅照顧，而得唔到健康同均衡嘅發展機會。如果社會冇為呢啲兒童嘅家庭提供足夠嘅支援嘅話，呢啲兒童響成長之後能夠脱貧嘅機會亦都相對低，而跨代貧窮嘅問題亦都會有延續嘅情況，長遠會對社會。

73
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:05,910
嗯。

74
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,830
貧窮兒童。

75
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,810
多謝，Mr. Mulvaney。We like to invite Ms. Lioni Wujisingi。

76
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:44,740
now more than ever is the time for a holistic approach to child poverty reduction that includes diversity, mainstreaming and cultural assimilation.

77
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,990
The racial segregation reduces the opportunities for ethnic minority children to effectively integrate because of a weak Chinese language learning environment.

78
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:38,270
And so, what has the government actually done to follow up on their international legal obligations? Reports have consistently shown that the government approach so far has been woefully inadequate.

79
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:34,520
It is a question of leadership, and I can only hope that our leaders will have the moral fortitude to uphold their international legal obligations and take a stand for the children that will be Hong Kong's future.

80
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:28,260
They have recommended that the Hong Kong adopt a multi-dimensional set of criteria and take all necessary measures to remove regional and ethnic disparities.

81
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:15,610
The lack of integration, as a result, perpetuates and reinforces its language and cultural barriers, and thus continues to create prejudicial stereotypes towards ethnic minority children.

82
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:54,470
Good morning, Chairman. Thank you. I'm also from Daly Ho and Associates. I want to highlight in particular a few more groups of vulnerable children who are living in poverty in Hong Kong.

83
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:56,440
The government has failed to address systemic factors that leave ethnic minority children particularly vulnerable to poverty. For example, although designated school system was abolished in 2013, de facto racial segregation remains as 60% of ethnic minority children are still concentrated in former designated schools.

84
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:24,560
An adversarial subculture towards ethnic minorities continues to pervade in Hong Kong society, and so it is absolutely critical that ethnic minorities are not unfairly targeted, and that that fenceless obstacles that our government has not removed are actually addressed.

85
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:18,130
and so this issue has been raised in the most recent concluding observations of the committee of the rights of the child in 2013. and so with respect to article 27 of the conventions of the rights of the child, the committee has held that ethnic minority children are disproportionately represented amongst the poor that live below the poverty line.

86
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:50,160
由於兒童成長喺貧困嘅家庭，物資生活長期亦都比較匱乏，咁所以呢啲兒童除咗喺生理同健康方面嘅需要之外，亦都令到佢哋個心理上面嘅素素質受到影響嘅。因此，我哋認為政府首先應該增加對貧窮兒童嘅經濟支援，例如現時中本家庭嘅學生膳食。

87
00:13:50,160 --> 00:14:10,170
津貼每日只係得二百八十五蚊，平均除翻開嚟，其實如果翻二十日學，只係得十四個幾。咁應該當局其實都基本提升翻，就係話可以每日提供翻二十五蚊嘅津貼，即係話將佢提升到去五百蚊嘅水平。而小朋友翻學嘅交通津貼，亦都應該將佢哋喺暑假同埋其他假期參與學校。

88
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:30,180
校課外活動嘅時候需要用嘅交通資助都包埋落去，咁咧長遠嚟講可以鼓勵翻佢哋可以參加課外活動，去提升翻佢哋文化素質。咁而我哋覺得政府最好就可以推出為啲同學推出一啲個人嘅八達通，噉啊可以透過直接嘅實報實銷資助方式為佢哋提供交通津貼，亦都減。

89
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:50,190
減省咗佢哋一啲複雜嘅審批程序，令到佢可以得到真正嘅需要嘅補貼。而我哋經常都睇到咧，一啲基層家庭喺面對通脹嘅時候，非常之要節衣縮食。好多時可能會食一啲即食麵啦、罐頭啦，甚至乎可能去誒，即等到啲街市收咗檔之後，買啲好平同埋好差嘅食物。所以啲小朋友都會長。

90
00:14:50,190 --> 00:15:10,200
其出現營養不良或者挨餓嘅情況，咁當局其實應該盡快增加現時短期嘅食物支援計劃，包括而家只係得七間資助機構嘅名額，可以將呢啲名額咧增加翻一啲食物銀行嘅計劃啦，咁令到小朋友咧可以得到足夠嘅營養，同埋可以令到佢嗰個生理上邊咧可以得到充分嘅幫助。

91
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:30,320
另外，亦都可以仿效翻而家嘅在校嘅免費午膳嘅做法，增加翻早餐津貼，咁令到貧困兒童可以免費獲得呢個午膳資源，都可以得到呢個免費午餐，咁可以喺學校咧增加個受惠人數。咁而我哋估計咧呢個建議大約可以每個學期有六萬名嘅兒童受惠嘅。咁隨住社會入邊遷啦。

92
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:50,330
而家兒童面對問題都比較複雜同多方面嘅，咁教早前特首亦都承諾會成立一個恆常嘅委員會，作為政府兒童政策嘅諮詢機構，保障兒童權益。我對民建聯十分支持呢個建議，亦都認為成立兒童事務委員會係履行聯合國兒童權利公約所制定嘅責任，相信可以保障。

93
00:15:50,330 --> 00:16:10,340
兒童嘅福利同埋確保制定政策嘅時候，可以充分考慮兒童嘅需要嘅觀點，等社會可以清晰咁聽到兒童嘅聲音同理解佢嘅需要，達至維護兒童權益同埋有助評估嗰個政策嘅成效。多謝主席，多謝各位。好，唔該曬方純一。Next，we'd like to invite Mr. Malani of the Daily Ho and Associates.

94
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:35,920
Over time, this also leads to dramatically lower higher education attainment, and results in a lasting detrimental impact on the economic outlook of ethnic minority children. And so it should be apparent why failed government policy is leading to a cycle of intergenerational poverty that will continue to unfairly harm generations of ethnic minority.

95
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,170
真嘅。

96
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,540
跟住請鄧家亨。

97
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,360
我們不能否認這些孩子的權利，只是因為我們的政治討論和辯論。

98
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:57,390
而家嘅爭議係關於香港嘅移民政策。

99
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:34,170
therefore, we urge the Hong Kong government to consider a durable solution for these children, so that they are able to become contributing members of the Hong Kong society.

100
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:24,090
asylum seekers and refugee children for quite a while now, and we have seen the Hong Kong government take a great many steps to provide for those communities.

101
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:58,110
The refugees in Hong Kong have to rely on the already stretched international system in order to obtain a durable solution.

102
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:34,780
although the Hong Kong government is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the commencement of the USM screening process is a step towards the right direction.

103
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:48,560
這確保了審查申請人是用高程度的公義，是需要的。然而，我們必須知道，因為香港不是1951年難民條約的成員。

104
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:49,450
part of the community, but because there is no durable solution offered to them, they have no future prospects of higher education or finding employment, which leaves them in a cycle of poverty and systemic discrimination.

105
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:14,980
Concerning their permanent residence, therefore, there are many children of asylum seekers and refugees who have come to Hong Kong not because of any fault or decision of their own, who are left in a situation of limbo with little in the way of future prospects.

106
00:18:45,520 --> 00:19:05,530
no child deserves to be left behind, whether Chinese or non-Chinese. Every child deserves to have space to play, an environment to learn, and a society that gives them opportunities to fulfil their potential. But the government continues to drag its feet by failing to take concrete measures to adopt a child poverty reduction strategy that accounts for the needs of ethnic minority children.

107
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:14,890
asylum seekers and refugees are a main topic of interest in the recent past in Hong Kong. Although the phenomenon has not been a new phenomenon, however, the need to address the issues raised by these communities is greater now than ever before. In Deliho and Associates, we work with

108
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,800
係主席。

109
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,000
Now they are fluent in speaking Cantonese, but he still struggles with Chinese language at school.

110
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,480
My name is Danny Laureas, a Filipino, and working as teaching assistant at the City University of Hong Kong.

111
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,200
好唔該曬，陳家亨。Next，we like to invite Mr. Reyes。Good morning，Mr. Chairman。

112
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:31,080
When our family decided to settle in Hong Kong in 2007, it was very clear to me they need to learn to speak, read and write Chinese to have a future here.

113
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:21,350
my children, Isaac and Kyle, studies in Chinese schools since they were kindergarten. My 11-year-old daughter, Isaac, is now primary six. Her eight-year-old brother, Kyle, is primary three.

114
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:13,780
very different. They don't talk to me. Asie now feels a sense of belongingness with her friends. Her brother Kyle could read a Chinese children's story simultaneously from Chinese to English to me. I was very impressed how his learning of the Chinese language has improved.

115
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:15,250
佢可能要抽籤啊，好多嘢噉樣。咁其實變相都係減少咗佢究竟可唔可以穩定噉樣去做嘅，即係可能一個放餘託管或者係幼兒照顧噉樣。咁可能佢製得呢一年係知道佢係申請到嘅，咁個父母就好難去揾一啲嘅工作，即係去增加翻佢嘅收入噉樣。咁同埋就係。

116
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:35,270
在 our work, we have met with many children of refugee families who have spent a major portion of their lives in Hong Kong, and some who have in fact been born in Hong Kong and who are proficient in Chinese and call Hong Kong their home because they know no other. They have received their formative education in Hong Kong, and they are.

117
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:24,790
而政府雖然已提供小學和中學教育給這些兒童，但這意味著這些兒童沒有未來在就業或高等教育，他們被定罪為過著在社會福利和貧窮中生活的兒童，並帶著被社會所依賴的標籤。

118
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:54,480
whatever the reasons for these children's presence in Hong Kong, they are here now. We cannot ignore them, and we need to consider what must be done so that they are ensured the best. And in doing so, we not only ensure the future of these children, but also of Hong Kong. Thank you very much. Thank you, Miss.

119
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:17,830
係誒，主席你好。咁即係我個人覺得就係嘅，即係點樣去保障即係貧窮兒童嘅人權，其實係每一方面都係環環相扣嘅。即係講係住屋啊、教育啊、父母嘅工資啊，同埋政府嘅政策，其實每一樣嘢都係唔可以缺少嘅。即係我首先講翻就係可能住屋為例啦。咁其實即係一個小。

120
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:37,840
朋友噉，佢喺屋企其實嘅需要就係一個生活嘅活動空間啦，同埋一個學習嘅空間。咁如果好多貧窮兒童噉，佢係住喺一啲劏房或者擠迫嘅空間嘅時候，咁其實佢就冇一個合適嘅地方去，即係佢去學習或者教嘅。咁因為其實即係我以前都係可能我凈係可以喺張牀上面趴喺度做功課或者咩噉，但係。

121
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:57,850
同時間之屋企又會喺度煮飯啊，電視聲又好嘈嘅時候，咁其實就冇一個真係可以畀兒童嘅學習嘅機會。咁所以其實我覺得誒，即係政府喺保障兒童嘅人權方面，如果住屋嘅話，其實係應該即係保障翻，憑兒童喺即係住喺公屋，即係一啲係合適翻佢哋畀一啲足夠空間佢哋住嘅地方啦。咁同時亦都頭先都講。

122
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:17,860
講嘅就係即係工時，其實都一個好大影響嘅。咁因為其實如果父母可能係香港，其實每個人都長工時嘅時候，咁其實即係長工時對兒童影響就係佢得唔到一啲父母嘅關心啦。咁其實兩父即係父母可能都出去做嘢嘅時候，咁亦都得唔到一啲嘅照顧嘅。咁所以其實政府應該係規管翻即係喺香港工。

123
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:37,870
時啦，即係可能有八小時工作制嘅時候，令到翻即係父母係可以放工嘅時候，仲有精力可以照顧翻兒童，可能喺情感上面或者生活上面嘅需要。咁同埋就係咁一方面即係工時方面啦，咁同時就係其實一啲嘅託管啊或者一啲嘅福利其實都唔足夠嘅。之後可以見到其實政府只係提供一啲普通嘅資。

124
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,860
field of different ethnic groups.

125
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,870
before we felt alone，thank you。

126
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,430
Thank you, Mr Reyes. Next, we like to invite Ms Deane Reyes.

127
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,120
communicate with Hong Kong citizens, and if they don't know how to communicate.

128
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:52,660
for ourselves. However, we are more hopeful now, hopeful now than before. You see, my child and I are here speaking to.

129
00:27:51,420 --> 00:28:01,020
and millions of money have already been allocated yearly. I have yet to see the substantial improvements on the curriculum-based support that would help.

130
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:22,970
provide textbooks to schools designed for ethnic minorities. In my view, the CSL policy is yet to be embraced with clear understanding of its purpose.

131
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:20,340
我不能 chat  with my classmates. 我不能 even 答應他們 questions. 它是 hard. 但 when 我 went to primary school, 它是 more 挑戦性。

132
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:12,040
that would have direct benefit to the children. We parents are left to tackle on our own, like spending money on Chinese tutorials. The government should develop a CSL curriculum.

133
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:32,500
first， it was about fitting in。 like I said， my Chinese was not that good， so no one wanted to be friends with me。 I did not feel accepted by my Chinese classmates。

134
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:46,200
我唔 want the ethnic minorities to feel what I have felt，所以 my advice is， when the ethnic minorities enter Chinese kindergarten， if they don't understand what the teacher teaches in class。

135
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:51,060
and to begin to dream what they want to become in Hong Kong, indeed they can have contribution in Hong Kong society. In 2004, the Chinese Second Language or CSL framework was a policy in the right direction. However, since its adoption,

136
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:57,880
助而啲資助咧，其實只係有好少名額嘅。咁其實即係以前我都可能即係幫一啲嘅家庭去申請一啲資助一啲一啲嘅服務嘅時候咧，咁其實佢哋都會反映就係好多時都要同其他即係家庭去爭，即係每次都係申請。咁可能今次佢呢個服務可能佢有一年嘅時間，咁可能下年就唔知申唔清得到，因為佢。

137
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:36,190
誒呢個嘅教育方面啦，咁其實即係我之前都係有幫一啲可能亞馬遜嘅小朋友補習噉樣。咁其實當中亦都發現，其實唔係淨止即係香港嘅兒童，唔係淨止係一啲普通嘅香港學生啦。其實即係一啲少數族裔，其實都好需要誒政府有關注翻，因為其實佢哋本身家庭方面，其實可能冇一啲嘅社區資訊或者資源去到。

138
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:56,200
佢係知道佢點申請或者點做嘅時候，咁其實誒相對佢哋嘅兒童係更加係貧乏啦，即係佢哋係冇嘢得到任何嘅支援。噉我係幫佢補習，只係幫到佢少少噉樣，亦都唔知點樣可以去申請。咁所以希望政府可以加多誒一啲嘅社區中心，去到畀唔同嘅小朋友，佢哋可以多啲唔同嘅服務噉樣係。

139
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:57,340
After eight years, I'm still convinced my decision to send them to mainstream Chinese schools was correct. I knew this is the only way they could integrate in the society and to have opportunities in the future. Few days ago, Asie told me, "You know, Daddy, I have many Chinese friends now. I play with them in primary one. It was."

140
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:34,110
this improvement comes with a huge emotional, mental and financial cost to us parents. Our experience tells that ethnic minorities' children can learn to speak, read and write Chinese. They can have future if they are given opportunities. They can acquire skills, develop their talents, master the potential.

141
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:43,650
That they are meant to help children's development and social integration, these policies should be embraced fully by the government, the civil servants and the society if they are work, if they are, to work effectively. Today I still get curious questions: Why did we send our children to Chinese schools? Why are we making it hard?

142
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,270
Thank you, Denis.

143
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,680
Next, we like we like to invite Miss Susan Chakor.

144
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,510
教師 share with Unison that there is a lack of teaching materials.

145
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,270
當我們談到兒童的權利、發展和參與，的關鍵是。

146
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,740
我 surely hope that our educational bureau officials are listening.

147
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,560
C.S.L. learning framework and support measures to N.C.S. students in learning Chinese.

148
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:16,230
多謝主席。誒，大家好，我叫Susan Shakur。誒，我代表香港融樂會嘅。噉，anyways，誒。

149
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:55,150
professional resources guidance on and guidance on teaching students whose mother tongue is not Chinese.

150
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:04,270
developing teaching materials and textbooks should not be responsibility of teachers. In fact, it should be the responsibility of government and education bureau.

151
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:38,120
If that happens, the ethnic minorities can work in groups or activities. They will be sitting in the corner, watching their classmates play.

152
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:35,240
The right to equal education. Since EDB has introduced a Chinese SCSL framework in 2014, Unison has been closely following up with the concerned stakeholders on the implementation of.

153
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:55,120
那會ffect未來 of their lessons. They will be set aside just like us if they are a broken pencil. So I'm hoping that you will listen to my advice and and decide to help these children like myself. This is the end of my speech. Thank you.

154
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:21,730
Hello everybody, my name is Denise Reyes, but my nickname is Icy. First, I want to thank you for inviting me here today to have a speech with you guys. The reason why I'm really here is to discuss about the right of the ethnic minority. As you can see, Hong Kong is

155
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:44,150
Like myself, a Filipino, like me, they're having a hard time learning Chinese. We should talk about the situation of children. Children who are living in Hong Kong are also the future of Hong Kong. But if they don't know the language we always use Chinese, they won't be able to.

156
00:29:49,820 --> 00:30:09,830
they they can't work when they grow up because they don't know Chinese language. We need to change that. We need to help the ethnic minorities to improve their Chinese so that they can work for Hong Kong. Take me as an example. When I first came to a Chinese kindergarten.

157
00:30:47,210 --> 00:31:07,220
The teachers should explain it to them in a way they can understand. In that way, they can learn Chinese without stressing out. Then maybe that will solve problem number one. So now we move to the problem of acceptance. They learn Chinese and now they face classmates. We know at a very

158
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:27,230
年輕 age， they sometimes don't mind other people's feelings and say what they want to say. It sounds fine to them， but the ethnic minority sometimes feel sad and hurt to know what they are really thinking. So what I'm trying to say is that I don't want any separations from Chinese children and the ethnic minority.

159
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:24,600
while teachers may set learning targets and expected learning outcomes using the learning framework, they feel that benchmarking on what students should know and able to do at certain stages at the school cycle is necessary. Moreover, there should be guidelines on developing a curriculum that organises teaching math.

160
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,630
非常。

161
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,290
yes。

162
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,410
enhanced funding support.

163
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,540
for us to gain employment and be part of the society.

164
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:31,700
Thank you, Ms. Sapua. Next, we like to invite Ms. Sida Aga.

165
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:32,570
I find it very, very difficult, frustrating, and feel depressed as I find no support at all from anywhere to learn Chinese.

166
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:23,580
curriculum， and now I find it very difficult to cope up， and me and my parents are overburdened with fees of private tutor and extra classes.

167
00:34:46,720 --> 00:35:04,240
Both professional and student support to be made available to schools and government should actively promote such free services instead of only asking schools to apply for limited funding of fifty thousand. Although the learning framework has only been launched for two years.

168
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:23,620
In fact, the ethnic minorities community has has been waiting for more than a decade for better education support. Unison maintain that only a comprehensive policy with clear guidelines and procedures can enable ethnic minority students attain equal equality in education.

169
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:44,610
outline the syllabus to be taught, as mentioned by EDB at the meeting panel of education on progress on supporting Chinese learning and teaching for non-Chinese speaking students. Assessment tools developed by the Hong Kong U to assess the Chinese level of NCS students are used by schools which receive.

170
00:33:46,690 --> 00:34:06,700
UNISON urges the EDB to compile assessment data obtained at the beginning and the end of school terms from year two thousand fourteen two thousand fifteen to two thousand sixteen and two thousand seventeen. The reports on the number of NCS student in each level.

171
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:26,710
corresponding to the learning framework by year. This is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the learning framework. One cannot assume Chinese language is easier to NCS students in school with one to nine NCS students. In fact, scholars have stated that submission, submersion and mainstream school without prior intelle

172
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:46,720
Second language instruction and continuous support system is not conductive to second language learning. Schools with less than 10 NCS students often find it difficult to allocate additional manpower and resources to develop effective support measures for their students. We suggest, we recommend.

173
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,150
多謝主席。

174
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,070
are also facing the exact same problem.

175
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,860
第二個問題，我ethnic少數族羣喺香港面，係。

176
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,280
我舉個例子，我 younger brother， who goes to a Chinese mainstream。

177
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,100
我係原嚟從巴基斯坦，但係我係住喺香港十六年。

178
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,360
Thank you, Muniba. Next, we like to invite Ms. Ikracouneau.

179
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,870
I am Ikra from Delhi Memorial School Broadway. Currently, a secondary five student.

180
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:57,970
As language barrier is the main problem, it is also difficult for parents to know what is going on in their child's school life.

181
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:38,630
所以，如果他唔學好中，我唔諗佢可以理解任何一啲佢喺中學學嘅科目，除咗英文。

182
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:17,600
The Education Bureau should provide strict concrete guidelines and resources to schools to help ethnic minorities to improve their Chinese.

183
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,630
primary school， he has been facing problems in learning Chinese language. The school provides after-school tutorials， but however.

184
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:48,370
I'm very certain that he's not the only one who's facing this problem, but also some of my cousins who go to mainstream Chinese schools and some of my friends.

185
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:02,330
for example, with regards to Chinese learning situation, the school support difficulty for parents involvement and etc.

186
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:09,290
As all the notices are provided only in Chinese, and when they call the parents to school for some meetings, they also talk in Chinese. A lot of E.M. parents sitting there but did not understand.

187
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:30,150
however, it isn't adequate. The difficulty is not only affecting his Chinese language, but also having an impact on all the other subjects he learns because they're also taught in Chinese, like maths and his general studies.

188
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:53,770
since human right of children includes right to development and participation, which includes equal education opportunities, I would like to discuss about the educational structure of ethnic minority students, which affecting their future in Hong Kong.

189
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:54,070
Dear members, thank you very much for inviting us today to share our views. My name is Moniba. I was born in Hong Kong. I'm eight years old and studying P3 at a local DSS school. I was automatically put in the non-Chinese speaking stream in primary school where we are taught a very basic level of

190
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:14,080
Chinese and I believe I will never be able to learn Chinese fully and integrate in the mainstream society. Hence, I will never be fully employable and be a productive member of the society, leading to poverty. After reviewing my future choices, I requested my school to change my stream to Chinese.

191
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:52,860
我 also want to bring to your attention about the segregation of Chinese and non-Chinese students in school. This is wrong, as it creates an invisible mental barrier between Chinese and non-Chinese students, and this will continue as we grow up, causing a divided society again, indirectly making it difficult.

192
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:16,830
The division also further limits our chances of practising and learning Chinese language and integrating. I would like to tell the education department not to divide us, but instead mix us, so that we non-Chinese speaking students can have a better chance of living in Hong Kong respectfully and happily. Thank you.

193
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,490
following the guidelines.

194
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,370
在長遠，我們兩黨必須團結為更好的香港。謝謝。

195
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,430
在這些學校，佢哋教緊 easy level of Chinese， which is not adequate， such as CSL。

196
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,910
Not accountability. If when we say accountability to parents, is not just Chinese parents. You have to include NCS parents as well.

197
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:30,470
That we rarely get an opportunity to mingle with the locals, as in DSS schools, ethnic minorities are the majority.

198
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:58,420
We learn stuff that I think Muniba in P three is now learning, and that is a really low level, for us Form Five students to learn.

199
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:45,590
政府應 step up the effort to facilitate early integration of ethnic minority children into the mainstream system， with starting with kindergarten.

200
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:41,430
因此，The DSS schools are mainly focused for ethnic minority students. Since mainstream schools do not accept the ethnic minority, so it's not our choice to study there.

201
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:28,560
Learning and growing up with Chinese will clear misunderstanding or any stereotypes which they have for each other. The Chinese and ethnic minority students will bond and learn about each other's culture, embrace one another.

202
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:15,710
Living in a place like Hong Kong, we have to learn to communicate with locals in their native language, which is Cantonese, as we might be working with them in the future. Learning Cantonese is not only about working opportunities, but also crucial for us to integrate into mainstream society and actually participate in the society.

203
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:53,910
Thank you, Ikra. Next, we like to invite Ms. Payo, Ms. Ms. Was of Society for Community Integration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A lot of deputations over here have spoken about ethnic minorities' right to education, and I would particularly like to focus on the kindergarten education of ethnic minorities.

204
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:13,920
我們歡迎新教育局指引給幼稚園，要求幼稚園提供雙語入學相關文件及替代面試安排。但仍有族裔少數家長面臨歧視，入學時因語言障礙，他們常被問：，如？

205
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:33,930
你知唔知呢個係一個中國學校，或者我們唔收你嘅小朋友，所以唔係夠呢啲指引，而且唔係夠要請家長報案，要主動監察呢啲，監察應該要喺度，睇下幼稚園係咪。

206
00:41:45,870 --> 00:42:05,880
This week on 2 November, Hong Kong Unison held a press conference in which they released their research report, accountability of kindergarten education to ethnic minority community. And I think Honourable Chan Ren was a part of the press conference. This research was on 151 QR reports from.

207
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:25,890
三個地區， to investigate what kind of information non-Chinese parents missed from the Chinese-only QR reports, and to assess if the information provided in the reports reflected performance of kindergartens on teaching and learning for ethnic minority children and parents. The research shows that

208
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,760
elsewhere， so。

209
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,440
accountability。Thank you.

210
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,420
I think.

211
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,880
good afternoon, good morning, Mr Chairman.

212
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,060
多謝，Miss Biswas。Next， we like to invite。

213
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,850
Aruna Vorana of the NCS Parents Education Concern Group.

214
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,770
在 my personal experience and so did happen to so many other parents. They are not.

215
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:21,110
一旦他們 observe the malpractices in kindergartens or the breaches to the curriculum and administration guides.

216
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:41,410
Moving forward with the schooling, as per new policy mentioned by Miss Carrie Lam, the Chinese history should be taught compulsory in the school.

217
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:08,660
I'm Aruna Rana and I'm the second generation in Hong Kong. So I have three children. My daughter follows the mainstream schools. She's in secondary two, and I have twin boys. They are in kindergarten.

218
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:10,470
If they were, then I wouldn't have been called not once but twice within two weeks of the start of my daughter's school to meet the teachers, and all they had to say was, "Have I found another school for my daughter?"

219
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:24,340
And within this period of six years in her primary school, I've been facing a lot of difficulties to follow with the Chinese and getting help from outside, which is very expensive. So.

220
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:45,900
current education bureau kindergarten quality assurance framework fails to provide accountability to NCS parents. The EDB should provide English version of QR reports and ensure equal access of information to enhance the accountability to these NCS parents. Because it's

221
00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:13,680
parameters in the new performance indicators include kindergartens' performance in catering to the needs of NCS parents and children. The EDB review team should take note of such parameters, monitor and reflect in the QR reports the performance of kindergartens that admit the NCS children. They should make recommend

222
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:41,400
such as overconcentration of NCS students, which is unfavourable to early integration. The school report of NSE grants under the free kindergarten, free quality kindergarten education scheme should be uploaded to the school website every year to allow public access and monitoring, and hence to ensure.

223
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:46,830
我 and 我 as a parents and my children are actually facing a lot of difficulties in Hong Kong schooling. We the parents and the children are moving forward and embracing all the difficulties and trying our best to integrate in the society. But it is school teachers are ready to embrace us. I in my personal experience.

224
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:33,050
I think there should be a mandatory teacher and professional training provided to not only teachers but to principals too, so that they are aware of cultural sensitivity and they know how to handle a lone ethnic student they have in a school. And training should not be taken lightly. It should be measurable and result orient.

225
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,500
多謝，Miss Rana。

226
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,910

234
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:17,850
所以，要keep up with the Chinese language and to be in line， Chinese learning should be stepped up for our children， so that we can follow the Hong Kong government policy and be a proud citizen with the equal knowledge provided by the government. Thank you.

235
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:55,520

239
00:45:41,690 --> 00:46:01,700
我們更為滿意和歡迎這個政策，讓我們的子女可以探索和了解更多關於中國和它的歷史，他們也應該如此，因為我們住在香港，這是我們的家。但，是否可行給我們的子女，他們正在努力進入主流學校？

240
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:39,340

誒，佢哋都係攞唔到個服務，咁可能其中個資訊即係佢哋唔知道啦，或者佢哋嗰個資格有有困難啦。咁呢啲不如你直接回應，唔好讀稿啦，好冇？

253
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:15,100
我諗都係要睇翻佢哋個人，即係家家庭咧，自己有冇需要啦。即係佢有時會喺市場度自己會買一啲電腦，因為市場上可能都有時有啲平嘅電腦啊，誒誒電腦折啊噉樣，噉佢未必會需要誒揾我哋嘅服務嘅。

254
00:49:52,540 --> 00:50:10,250
誒，關於學生提誒為學生提供培訓啦，會教導佢哋如何正確及安全嘅使用。唔使，我諗差唔多啦，話你都讀曬你嗰啲誒，我哋知道而家係有個服務。不過頭先議會者所表達嘅就係嗰個。

你咗一般嘅治療啊，同埋誒嗰個口腔衞生個個誒推廣咁誒。至於細一啲組別嗰啲咧，即係幼稚園啊嗰啲咧，咁其實誒我哋誒誒。

267
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:47,800
誒唔知呢個會唔會應到？係佢哋就係講緊誒一啲貧窮嘅家庭，佢哋十八歲以下咧都講緊即係學前同埋，就算去到中學階段咧，嗰個牙科嘅治療都係好重要。

268
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:33,990
由小學去到中學都有每年畀佢哋去做一啲誒檢查，咁誒有唔同誒唔同嘅誒年歲啦，即係話誒即係嗰個年級咧，噉係有唔同嘅配套嘅。

269
00:51:49,290 --> 00:52:09,300
誒咁啦，誒我就牙科嘅，噉我先講咗牙科一部分啦。咁其實誒喺香港嚟講，大部分啦，九十六percent到嘅小學生其實誒嗰個都參加咗牙科嗰個保健服務嘅。噉我哋誒已經係處。

270
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:45,230
嗰個口腔健教組咧，咁都有一啲嘅誒配套啦。例如，我哋有誒喺誒K two嘅時候，就會誒請佢哋嚟誒做一啲嘅誒visit，噉就佢哋會係可以喺誒陽光小樂園嗰度咁去體驗下呢個誒。

271
00:52:45,230 --> 00:53:05,240

273
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,180

或者係就住一啲低收入家庭，佢哋話誒要申請一啲學習，譬如話游水或者其他嘅訓練，咁其實個選擇唔多啦，同埋都係靠青資噉，但係一期就做完啦噉。咁呢方面你哋有冇回應啦，黃女士？

276
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:40,390
誒多謝主席。噉就住誒活動方面咧，咁誒我補充翻就係話，我哋十八個分區嘅同事咧，都會就住區內誒一啲N G O或者一啲綜援團體咧，就同佢哋一合辦嘅。咁每年咧都有誒若干嘅即係誒康體活動咧，係直接我哋嘅對象咧。

277
00:55:40,390 --> 00:56:00,400
係一啲低收入家庭嘅，我哋係透過N G O或者S W D咧，係同佢哋做一啲合辦嘅活動。咁當中誒包括我諗佢係擔心到個名額不足啊，次次都係誒爆曬棚啦，就要抽籤啦，或者係要鬥快啦噉樣誒，唔容易攞到噉，甚至佢哋講緊清晨去排隊咧。

278
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:20,410
就兩兄弟定係兩兄妹咧？就一個有一個冇咁呢個情況，你哋覺得即係要唔要改善咧？誒，呢其實頭先講到，如果係清晨去排隊嗰啲咧，就會係誒個別嘅市民自己去報名嘅。噉我啱啱頭先提到話誒，同N G O或者係誒S W D大家合辦嗰啲咧。

279
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:40,430
就係會誒由誒NGO同事咧係直接誒針對住低收入家庭嘅對象咧係專登係課佢哋嘅活動嚟嘅，咁嗰個報名情況咧就直接由中心嗰邊去安排嘅，噉就唔需要啲誒小朋友去我哋嘅counter嗰度報名咯。

280
00:56:40,430 --> 00:57:00,440
咁頭先話報唔到名嗰啲咧，就係誒自己個別，即係當係誒個別市民去報名嘅嚇。咁除咗活動之外咧，咁其實我哋唔係講報名嘅方法，係講緊名額嘅不足問題。好啊，咁誒呢方面我都可以誒翻去同翻同事講，即係喺我哋資源即係誒平衡同埋安排下誒希望。

281
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:20,450
希望可以將嗰個名額會會擴充嘅咁呢個，我哋會翻去即係帶翻畀各區嘅同事，即係睇翻誒區內嗰個誒綜援家庭嗰個誒誒人口，再去誒即係考慮誒增加翻嗰個活動咯嚇。咁呢方面我會帶翻去嘅。咁除咗活動之外咧，噉。

282
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:40,460
誒就住康體設施咧，咁其實我哋十八區誒免費嘅設施，譬如誒誒遊樂場啊、誒足球場啊，或者係兒童遊樂場咧。誒譬如遊樂場嚟講，我哋各個分區十八分區加埋咧都會有個千個嘅。咁兒童遊樂場誒亦都係超過六百三十個，咁都係。

283
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:36,960
其實我翻對咧，都同翻我相相關嘅同事咧，去去反映同埋研究啊，係咪可行呢個？

284
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:46,140
好唔該曬，鄭生誒，在職家庭及學生資助事務處咧誒，會唔會有即係回應翻嗰個？

285
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:50,710
誒市民嘅意見啦，我哋需要的話咧，我哋喺喺喺實施之後咧，我哋有需要，如果真係要要有啲誒誒改善嘅話咧，亦都會改善嘅。

286
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:53,420
支援誒誒，譬如抽離式啊，譬如小組教學啊，領導啲學生咧快少少。鄭生啊，佢哋主要針對就誒兩樣啦，一就係嗰個。

287
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:44,730
同樣嘅課程就將佢剁細曬佢，然後都係同樣嘅時間要學曬。咁其實對於少數族裔或者非華語學生冇乜幫助。

288
01:01:45,010 --> 01:02:00,610
噉樣長遠嚟講，對佢哋係會構成即係學習上嘅困難，最終可能都係一個貧窮嘅循環嗰度。咁所以呢呢兩部分嘅，你不如集中回應呢呢度。啊，多謝主席，或者噉樣啦。

289
00:57:40,460 --> 00:58:00,470
誒隨時都係歡迎，即係誒各個市民啊、朋友啊，咁誒即係隨時享用咯嚇。咁呢個我補充係咁多，唔該。係啊，頭先有關尋求庇護者嗰個申請圖書證或者借書嘅問題誒，呢個我可能要會後補充，因為誒圖書館方面誒。

290
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:20,480
誒，我需要翻去即係問翻詳情嘅，因為我主要係負責誒康體設施嗰邊嚇，噉我會後補充翻嚇。而家好誒，請教育局阿鄭生回應下，頭先無論講消消逐鋭嗰個教育個問題啦，同埋誒之前嗰一節咧，好多朋友提到呢個特。

291
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:40,490
特殊教育需要嗰啲小朋友，佢哋喺即係嗰個進入六歲之後，一入小學咧就好多支援誒學前嘅支援。其實嗰部分啊，主要通過社署啦、誒勞福局嘅政策。咁但係入到小學咧就冇曬嘅噉樣。咁唔知道啊？

292
00:58:41,100 --> 00:59:01,110
鄭生有冇回應啊？都係主席，或者噉樣咧。就住頭先嘅問題咧，我誒我我我我就盡量補充啦嚇。咁誒誒，剛才都有有議會人士亦都亦都提到，就話有學有學生誒，即係尋求庇護嘅一啲家長嘅學生咧，喺入學方面嘅一啲困難。咁其實誒。

293
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:21,120
誒都明白，就係話我哋機制上咧，其實教育局咧都都係會確保咧，就符合資格入讀公營小學嘅學嘅學生咧，係有機會去去去入學嘅噉樣。咁誒機制就存在啦。咁其實我都尊重個機制，就係話我哋誒每一個有有特別，譬如話佢唔喺香港出世噉，其實我哋都會咧視乎咧誒。

294
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:41,130
誒入境處嘅嘅一啲建議咧，覺得呢個學生係咪可以符合喺香港入讀公營學校嗰個資格咧？噉樣噉我哋係誒，如果如果佢哋嘅advice係即係佢嘅建議係係覺得係得嘅話咧，噉我哋係會會會絕對係係提供協助，同其他小朋友一樣咧。我係透過我哋誒區域教育服務處咧，就幫。

295
00:59:43,150 --> 01:00:03,160
咁呢個第一點嚇噉。另外頭先亦都有有議會者亦都提到咧啊，有啲少少數族裔嘅啲學生咧喺學習中文上咧就遇到一啲困難噉樣。咁其實明白嘅，頭先我都聽到嘅。咁其實其實教育局都察覺，其實誒即即當然啦。喺教喺教育角度去睇嘅話咧，我哋都覺得誒誒即。

296
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:23,170
呢個作業學生係應該咧盡誒盡可能去融入我哋嘅社會，譬如學習中文啊噉樣，誒喺社區裏邊幫即係同其他誒小朋友溝通啊噉樣。咁其實誒我我哋畀學校嘅支援咧，特別一啲學校咧，如果佢錄誒佢佢取錄一啲教誒有係非華語學生嘅話咧，其實基本我哋從

297
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:43,180
幾方面啦。第一方面就係話，我哋按學生即係學校收誒錄取一啲非華語學生咧，我哋畀額外津貼。咁學校可以透過呢津貼咧，譬如話去聘去聘請一啲誒助理啊、服務啊，甚至教師啊，甚至誒購買一啲用具咧，就誒譬如話喺教學上咧，特誒誒提供特別嘅。

298
01:00:53,700 --> 01:01:13,710
誒過分集中咗，消數族裔喺某啲學校咧，就造成一個隔離啦，一個種族嘅隔離啦。對於佢哋學習中文同埋同個社會融合構成困難啦。第二就係誒呢啲嘅學校，就算教中文或者一般主流學校。

299
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:33,720
教中文而家用緊嗰個中文作為第二語言嗰個學習架構咧，就冇一個具體嘅課程內容，亦都教育局係冇發展到一啲嘅誒書本嘅，即係教科書。咁呢度都係即係你嘅做法就係將。

300
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:20,900
誒，我哋嗰個誒誒中文嘅第二第二學習語言嗰個學習誒結構咧，其實我一四一五年咧開始實施啦。咁其實誒都要補充少少，就係話咧，其實我哋有個結構咁之外，其實咧就教育局亦都為學校做咗一啲誒一啲學習套啊。就算你話書本噉樣咁書誒咁噉。

301
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,350
等等，啊！請啊！

302
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:36,050
好，我諗一陣，同事再跟進啦。我哋唔係太多時間噉啊。

303
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:57,190
有幼兒中心個學費減免係可以申請，同埋佢哋嘅就學開支亦都可以申請。咁基於咧，其實咧，基本上咧，佢同本地嘅兒童咧係即係。

304
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:30,090
咁但係就住個別嘅情況，頭先誒個別嘅例子啊，或者會誒延遲發放嗰個情況咧，其實因為我哋冇實質上嗰個資資料係讀咧，我哋亦都好難作出一個回應嘅。多謝主席。

305
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:50,770
我估最後畀社處就關於無論係嗰個誒中緩個制度本身啦，或者係誒而家即係就住一啲學生嘅支援誒。

306
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:27,120
健康啊，噉啊！請你回應翻頭先與會者啲問題。係誒，多謝主席嚇。噉就誒，如果提翻誒中門嗰度咧，或者我一間就請啊，我哋同事啊陳小姐咧，就詳細去講。咁頭先講翻嗰個誒。

307
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:45,790
月啊十月期間咧就係會發放到資助畀佢，咁呢個係一般嘅申請程序啦。就如果係講緊幼稚園學生嘅話咧，因為係按月發放嘅或嘅誒，即係每一個月都會發放呢個資助畀佢哋嘅。咁所以咧喺誒其實咧誒個申請咧，大概上咧喺誒。

308
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:40,910
咁書本就唔係政府去去去制定啦。噉我哋學習誒，即係話一啲支援嘅一啲啊，學習套啊套咧就畀咗學校。咁此外，其實我哋係有啲培訓畀誒畀老師嘅。咁誒，你話個課程上有冇不足嘅地方？咁誒誒，咁教育局咧亦都好好好好誠心去聆聆聽誒。

309
01:02:51,300 --> 01:03:11,310
好，就住頭先有朋友提到嗰個幼稚園嗰個質素評估咧，都係只係得中文噉。家長誒非華語嘅家長咧，都無從去瞭解到，即係選校嘅時候嗰個英文版會唔會提供咧？誒誒，因為我理解咧，都係誒。

310
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:31,320
幼幼稚園其實都係主流，都係佢哋嗰個教學語言咧，就係中文啦。噉我即係我喺我記憶裏邊都係一個報告咧，嗰個Q R report咧都係用中文去寫嘅。咁除非嗰間係一間英文小學啦，噉樣誒嘅嘅幼稚園啦。咁誒有關呢方面咧，我我或者噉樣啦，我我我我都記錄低。

311
01:03:46,500 --> 01:04:06,510
誒部分就係頭先尋求庇護，或者係一般家庭貧窮嘅家庭，因為你哋嗰個學生資助咧係滯後嘅，即係佢哋要首先墊資嘅。咁對於貧窮嘅家庭，或者根本唔準喺香港工作嘅呢啲尋求庇護嘅家庭咧。

312
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:26,520
佢哋無從去負擔嗰個學生嘅費用，一一入學已經要攞緊好幾千蚊出嚟。咁呢一個問題，誒或者就算係本身制度上即係要改善，頭先都講到一啲申請資格啊，誒希望增加一個四分三嗰個嘅門檻啊。

313
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:48,640
唐女士，回應係係多謝主席。噉就住誒，即係我哋學生資助嗰個誒，即係計劃個程序咧。咁或者我首先作一個回應先啦。咁基本上咧，誒喺我哋學生資助嗰個誒誒誒程序上邊咧，我哋已經盡量簡化個申請程序啦。咁譬如好似咧，我哋講係中。

314
01:04:48,640 --> 01:05:08,650
中小學嘅時候咧，我哋如果係誒，譬如啲學生係入表，譬如係五月啊，噉佢哋入表過嚟咧，其實咧大致上我哋喺誒，我哋會喺開學之前咧，就已經發放嗰個書簿津貼畀佢哋，即係大概喺七八月間咧，就等佢哋有呢個書簿津貼，係大部分嘅學生咧都誒，即係誒都能夠提供到呢個誒，即係。

315
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:28,660
學即係喺開學之前嗰個津貼嘅咁誒，當然啦。至於誒即係新生方面咧，就可能需要同學校咧有啲誒資料上邊個誒對碰啦。咁如果佢哋都係能夠喺六月之間咧係交到佢個申請表，如果係文件齊備嘅話咧，咁當然我哋都會咧盡量咧就喺誒即係九。

316
01:05:46,140 --> 01:06:06,150
九月到咧，個九月底到咧，其實咧，我哋儘量都希望咧可以發放到，即係第一期個資助畀有錢嘅學生。咁呢個就係嗰個大致上嘅申請情況啦。咁至於話誒，即係回應翻誒有關難民兒童申請學生資助嗰方面咧，咁其實咧就誒當然啦，即係我哋學生資助嘅主要對象咧就係香港居民。

317
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:26,160
啊！咁但係咧，就誒因應特別嘅情況，譬如誒入境處係已經唔反對嗰啲兒童係講短暫居留啦，又或者咧係再加上咧教育局咧都能夠編排到誒呢啲啊學位中小學嘅學位，又或者咧獲得幼稚園係接受入讀幼稚園咧，我哋都會係咧著情係畀翻。

318
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:46,640
啊！呢啲資助係畀啲難民兒童嘅，咁咧就誒，其實佢哋因為中小學同埋幼稚園都係實施緊免費教育啦，咁主要佢哋就可以申請嘅資助咧，就變咗包括係誒，即係中小學生啊，學校書本津貼啦、學生車船津貼啦、上網費津貼各樣咧，佢哋都可以申請。而幼稚園學生咧，佢哋亦都有誒幼稚園同。

319
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:17,840
所誒所誒要嘅誒申請嘅程序咧係一樣嘅，即係話，如果係佢我哋係誒接受咗佢申請嘅話咧，佢哋係根據呢啲情況咧，我哋亦都係，譬如好似幼稚園咁啦嚇，即係我哋儘量都希望可以咧喺學校確認咗佢哋入學嘅情況之下咧，就喺九月底到咧係可以咧就發放到資助畀佢哋。

320
01:07:51,050 --> 01:08:11,060
同埋誒一啲貧窮家庭，即係如果係佢哋喺誒除咗經濟以外嘅一啲支援咧，即係社署都負責嘅。噉啊，馮生，我知道你誒之前都唔舒服病過，噉我喺即係見到你早日康復，都希望你係身體誒恢復。

321
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,070
誒學童嘅資助嚟嘅。

322
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,860
需要在外食飯，而一啲額外嘅開支噉樣。

323
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:41,640
係咧，亦都係喺誒嗰個誒我哋嗰個援助計劃裏邊咧，都可以有一個支出嘅。咁當然呢個咧，亦都係誒誒嗰個國際服務社咧，都會係作每個個案咧係一個評審同埋一個批核嘅。

324
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:47,600
誒嗰啲誒即係申請誒庇護嘅誒人士，啲小朋友讀書嗰啲咧，其實就誒我哋誒亦都有一個服務咧，就係透過誒國際服務社咧，係誒支援一啲誒流港嘅人士嘅啊。咁但係呢個咧就只係誒限於咧。

325
01:08:47,600 --> 01:09:07,610
係交通啦、誒住宿啦、食物啦，同埋一啲誒佢嘅誒平時嘅衣服啊嗰啲噉嘅嘢嘅嚇。咁但係誒，我哋都理解咧，就係喺嗰個誒小朋友嗰個教育方面咧，誒我哋都關注啊。所以我哋都係誒誒配合翻咧誒誒I S。

326
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:27,620
都會咧係誒個別個案裏邊咧都會係去睇下點樣協助到咧係嗰啲誒小朋友咧係開學前嘅準備，例如一啲書簿啊一啲嘢咧睇下佢有冇啲物資上咧能夠係幫到佢哋嘅嚇。咁至於佢話誒要家長陪同啲小朋友翻學咁咧，其實佢嗰個交通費。

327
01:09:42,060 --> 01:10:02,070
咁誒或者頭先我都誒想補充翻一個誒有個位誒與會者哋都講到我哋嘅短期食物服務咧，咁其實咧就我諗大家都理解咧，就係喺今年嘅施政報告裏邊咧都提出咗咧，就係誒我哋將會延續三年嘅啊，咁呢個咧亦都係咧我哋咧都會係會喺短期內。

328
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:22,080
咧，我哋會係誒重新咧，喺一個新一輪嘅服務嘅一個建議書去延續嘅，即係徵求建議書嚇。咁即係話咧，我哋會將個服務嗰個誒誒，即係而家做開七隊咧，我哋會睇下誒嗰個誒安排上咧會唔會有所改。

329
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:42,090
裏邊嚇噉就當然，我哋都同誒而家嗰個誒啲持份者同業界去繼續係保持好緊密嘅聯繫。咁亦都今次一個機會咧，我哋都會做一個誒全面嘅檢視嘅，因為都係都理解咗呢個短期食品銀行都係行咗都差唔多誒八九年㗎啦。咁誒，我哋都睇。

330
01:10:42,090 --> 01:11:02,100
睇翻嘅都，業界都同我哋講，就係佢哋都誒睇到有個服務需要。咁但係咧，因為咧，其實政府喺扶貧方面咧，都係喺唔同嘅時間咧，都做咗好多唔同嘅設施。噉我哋將一片咧去研究翻咧，喺呢個誒短期食物服務裏邊嘅定位啊，同埋各方面嘅工作方面咧，我哋將會喺誒透過。

331
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:22,110
呢個延續三年裏邊咧，希望做到一個好全面嘅檢視嚇，或者我暫時補出咁多，我將個時間交畀阿陳姑娘講我哋嘅中門嘅情況。好啊，陳姑娘，好謝主席。咁咧都誒介紹下，而家喺中門計劃下咧，對於學童嘅資助其實咧主要係分開兩個大範疇嘅。第一咧就係基本金額，咁咧都係幫助。

332
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:42,120
哦，即係學童咧，佢就常基本嘅需要嘅。另外咧，就住學童咧就學開支嗰方面咧，都一啲特別津貼去幫助佢哋嘅。咁主要有幾樣啦，就係佢往返學校嗰個交通費津貼啦。咁同埋咧就係一啲考試費津貼，譬如佢考香港文憑試費用嘅津貼啦，同埋大學聯招嗰個費用嘅津貼嘅。

333
01:11:42,130 --> 01:12:02,140
咁亦都有一個定額津貼咧，就係幫助到學生咧，係喺開學之前咧，佢需要買課本啊、校服啊、文具等等嘅津貼。咁亦都有一個誒學誒膳食津貼，係如果佢係需要響在外誒誒午膳啦、全日制嘅學生，我哋有膳食津貼。咁呢個主要都喺綜援計劃下可以幫到，即係。

334
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:24,360
知道啊，不過佢哋就係提嗰個膳食津貼都係好不足。嗯，咁即係就算以中小學嚟講，而家即係講緊二百幾蚊啦。佢哋實質上學校收咧，往往都要去到四五百蚊啊，至少都即係噉，即係有個相差係幾遠下嘅。

335
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:44,370
係都可以解釋一下嘅。頭先都講咗誒喺綜援計劃下咧，除咗特別津貼之外咧，其實係有一個標準金額嘅。咁其實標準金額咧係誒所有綜援受助人都有，包括學童啦。咁嗰個標準金額係畀佢譬如日常膳食啦，即係誒佢做咗班學要食飯之後，其實佢喺屋企都要或者。

336
01:12:44,370 --> 01:13:04,380
其他時間都要有個膳食嘅，咁所以喺個標準金額入邊咧係有誒膳食嗰個即係資助喺度嘅。咁只不過咧誒就住一啲讀緊全日制又需要在外嘅學生咧，就會響即係標準金額以外咧，仲有一個特別津貼，係一個額外津貼，係資助翻可能因為佢出。

337
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,120
誒。

338
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,680
誒。

339
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,810
誒都係得五分鐘。

340
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,140
苦讀不吃兒啊！

341
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,860
難過咧，呢啲嘢我哋聽到嘅真係好揪心。

342
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,700
你申報咧，我自己本身就係一個貧窮嘅孩子啊！以前。

343
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:28,950
利益申報啊，主席！今日個題目係講貧窮嘅孩子。

344
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:52,540
所以聽嘅時間咧，我即係唔能夠唔攞呢張呢一張嘢出嚟啊，對住觀嘅。

345
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:20,670
誒，我覺得呢啲回應咧，其實係可以慳翻啲時間咧，畀多啲同事咧問問題嚇，因為我哋。

346
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:14,010
冇，佢就話點解有？我哋問佢有幾多人冇，佢就話有幾多人有。嚇，誒，而真正冇冇嗰啲嘢，佢佢仍然都唔會回應你話點解冇。

347
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:44,820
啊！我係我就喺貧窮面長大，所以對於呢個題目，對於大家講嘅誒一啲一啲學習裏面嘅困難啊，生活上嘅困難，其實咧誒好多畫面出翻曬嚟。

348
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:43,930
咁不過唔緊要啦，即係呢個對於家庭都係造成困擾。我我我意思唔係唔緊要，而係我而家冇時間同你進一步爭拗先，我要畀翻啲時間畀同事先啊。噉就誒，我首先請啊邵家臻議員，我哋五分鐘。

349
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:27,440
係，我哋知道你計到好盡，即係你標準金額已經話當佢食曬夠三十日三餐噉樣每日，就所以你喺在外食飯嘅時候咧，你就扣翻嗰部分出嚟，就剩翻咧唔知你點計到咧，就係二百零蚊噉樣。

350
01:13:44,730 --> 01:14:04,740
誒主席唔該誒由九點鐘到而家咧，我聽咗十聽咗三個鐘頭咧，團體講嘢，我一啲都唔介意咧。我聽佢三個鐘頭講嘢誒，令到我得五分鐘講嘢，我一啲都唔介意。但係我比較介意咧，主席你淨係畀咗十幾分鐘咧，官員回應，而嗰個回應咧，你聽得清楚咧，其實佢係介紹。我哋問佢點解？

351
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:15,430
嗰個苦係我都唔係第一次拎出嚟嘅，呢個苦唔係講緊老虎嘅苦，係講緊政府嘅苦啊！誒，你當你聽到誒有唔同嘅誒孩子講畀我哋聽啊，佢哋喺喺貧窮裏邊啊，再加埋喺面對唔同嘅社會制度下邊咧啊，點樣令到佢喺窮裏邊咧更加難？

352
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:39,150
誒嗰句我不殺白人，但係白人都為我而死。誒，我唔係令到或者政府話我唔係令到佢貧窮嘅，但係你哋嘅措施令到佢窮得嚟咧，係更加多苦難，更加多磨難。呢個希望即係所以喺唔同嘅政策裏邊，即係唔係淨係誒講到誒圖書館。

353
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,060
誒。

354
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,680
我後補翻資料。

355
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,930
先我哋提到嗰個移動事務委員會，就誒。

356
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:46,360
啊，梗係用家，梗係專家啦！唔通係做咩家？唔通笑家咩？

357
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:29,580
我喺個聲明報告裏邊咧話，九月咧開咗第一次嘅籌備委員會。

358
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:37,870
你可唔可以局副局長？可唔可以而家好直接話畀我知籌備委員會個名單係乜嘢？

359
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:06,950
即係佢唔係想聽呢啲嘢，佢唔係想我唔係想罰你坐咁簡單咯。希望你哋明白，罰你坐有乜意義啫？

360
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:25,910
春談春談吐絲嘅艱難啊！咁但係咁都但係都想話畀你知嘅時候，唔係只係畀比較官腔嘅回應。

361
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:17,290
啊！佢哋真係上得嚟講嘅時間，有啲人好難講嘅。講嘅時候好吞吞，好吞吞吐吐嘅，好似我噉啊。講嘅時候咧，好多，好似有一種即係。

362
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:21,230

你話我唔我唔識，你話講到誒報活動，跟住你話我翻去提醒下啲人咧報多啲誒誒揾多啲額啦，或者係誒誒佢佢自己報嘅啫，話誒佢自己可以排早啲啦，咁即係唔係淨你呢啲回應就可以回應就可以答到今日咁多人上嚟咁多係咁多咁多小朋友上嚟咁多家長上嚟。

364
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:46,480
我想問一個具體問題咧，就係關於兒童事務委員會，即係副局長都有提到呢一樣嘢。啊，兒童府兒童事務委員會咧，即係今日喺財政預喺呢個誒聲明報告咧，就有提到啦嚇，一百九十一一百九十三段。但係咧，第一樣嘢係咪歡迎咧？係歡迎，不過請政府留意咧。呢

366
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:58,340
有邊啲人坐喺個籌備委員會裏邊啊？噉我哋就會知道咧，究竟你哋嗰個兒童事務委員會，你眼中嘅兒童或者對兒童事務有關心嘅人係邊種人，係邊啲人啊？可唔可以先你回應到呢一部分先？副啊副局長啊，多謝主席。咁誒，頭先。

相關嘅專家，包括醫療啊、教育啊。我就想聽嗰啲名啊，對唔住，我唔係想知官嘅代表係誰。咁誒，我哋嚟緊會誒有好多嘅誒一啲諮詢嘅工作，我哋到時會再同大家。唔係點解而家唔講得嗰啲名單咧？嗰啲成員名單可唔可以公佈個名單啊？除梗係專家啦。

369
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,710

375
01:19:42,750 --> 01:20:02,760
誒同少多係可能嚟到咧，係畀到具體嘅資料，畀到好詳細資料。詳細資料嘅提供咧都係重要嘅，但係咧，我哋亦都需要咧係一啲咧係誒，即係能夠回應到嘅一啲嘅同事。誒誒，我明顯地，我覺得即係唔同嘅層次嘅同事係有唔同。

376
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:22,770
嘅誒嗰個回應嘅嗰個範圍嘅誒，譬如今次社會福利處，我覺得就真係好好啦。即係我哋有同事咧係，我相信係可以誒就住即係具體問題咧，翻去去諗個決策嘅問題。咁但係其他嘅同事可能佢只不不過能夠講到話，即係提供到資料畀我哋。咁所以，我覺得即係誒提。

377
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:42,780
即係派乜嘢同事嚟到坐喺我哋嘅公聽會嗰度，係其實非常之重要嘅。誒，正如頭先上級專員講，我哋即係其實唔係話個時間喺度嘅問題，我哋係希望同事能夠回應到啊，回應到係好重要嘅。即係今日講嘅內容有誒，我哋。

378
01:20:42,780 --> 01:21:02,790
喺度有誒前線係受緊影響嘅市民，亦都有一啲嘅專家嘅朋友。噉佢哋提供嘅意見，提供嘅親身嘅經驗，呢啲咧係希望咧係我哋嘅官員聽得到，同埋咧回應到回應都唔係話即刻咧你就能夠講話啊！我哋咧聽咗之後咧即刻決定噉啊。但係起碼。

379
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:22,800
你聽咗之後，你有個親身嘅感覺，你瞭解咗之後咧，你話啊，我呢個問題上面咧，可以可能可以需要咧，係翻去再去探討。跟住我哋覺得咧，的確有需要我哋回應啊。諸如此類，噉我覺得呢一個噉嘅回應其實都好重要。咁今日咧，好多謝我哋咧係誒好多嘅朋友咧出席啦，誒包。

380
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:42,810
第一節咧係我哋冇辦法可以請到佢哋畀到多啲嘅意見嘅朋友。誒，今日咧我係聽到咧係好多唔同嘅需要，誒唔同需要嘅朋友咧喺兒童嘅權利上面咧，雖然都係貧窮有關噉，但係佢係嚟自基層嘅，佢係嚟自呢個係誒外食嘅，佢係。

381
01:21:42,810 --> 01:22:02,820
嚟涉涉及到誒特殊較需要嘅，可能亦都有呢個係誒，即係尋求庇護嘅一啲嘅唔同嘅誒嘅羣體啦。佢哋都可能有唔同嘅需要。咁呢唔同嘅需要去到兒童權利嗰度咧，我覺得基本上咧有幾樣嘢咧係我今日咧係覺得係誒，即係聽到咧係覺得重要嘅。第一就係基本生活。

382
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:35,890
即係呢三個咧，即係如果缺乏呢三方面嘅誒，即係嗰個誒發展嘅話咧，其實佢就冇辦法咧係誒能夠咧喺第日成長嗰度咧係可以將佢嘅潛能咧係充分發揮到。如果佢哋嘅潛能唔能夠充分發揮嘅話咧，對於社會嚟講其實就係一個咧係。

383
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:24,860
健康、教育等等，都需要作出回應。

384
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,770
佢哋就選擇咗派一啲未必能夠回應到嘅官員嚟到。

385
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:55,790
係有機會嚟到呢度陳述，二度相關嘅官員可以聽到同埋回應到，咁但係好可惜咧。

386
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:27,040
係，我相信對於佢嚟講，佢讀到書，誒對佢嚟講同埋對社會嚟講個差別都好大。阿副部長可唔可以回應下？我哋誒會轉介跟進呢個講案。

387
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:38,500
誒呢方面勞福局副局長，你可唔可以帶領即係，其餘嘅相關部門都誒就住呢方面對誒立法會今日嘅公聽會作出一個書面回應？

388
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:55,900
好大好大嘅一個誒，即係虧欠對佢哋係虧欠，對社會嚟講亦都係一個好大嘅虧欠，因為因為佢哋將來如果唔能夠發揮得發展得到好嘅話咧，誒變咗整體嘅社會咧嚟講，可能仲有更多嘅負累添。我哋需要咧又有更將來咧付出更多嘅社會成本嚟到。

389
01:22:55,900 --> 01:23:15,910
去誒，即係處理嘅問題。但係如果你發展得發揮得好嘅，佢哋可以變成咧有貢獻。咁所以一來一回咧，其實對無論對個人嚟講或者對社會嚟講嘅影響都好好分別好大。噉我喺呢度咧就想特別咧提一提咧，就係誒今日係有幾位誒兒科基金嘅朋友喺度。

390
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:35,920
佢哋咧，其實有一份咧好詳盡嘅誒書面嘅文件咧，係交咗。咁裏頭咧亦都有啲好具體嘅建議，包括咧即係護脊啊，包括頭先講嘅牙科嘅問題啦，等等呢啲。今日誒即係相關嘅官員咧，未必能夠咧係回應到嘅。咁但係，我覺得呢啲切實嘅。

391
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:55,930
建議咧，誒，我好希望咧，政府能夠翻去咧，係真係誒，係考慮同埋回應嘅。當我哋嘅兒童嘅健康能夠得到一個學更大嘅保障嘅話咧，誒，即使係嚟自貧窮嘅家庭，咁但係咧，佢哋啊，相信咧，佢哋將來能夠畀到嘅對社會貢獻咧，都可以更。

392
01:23:55,930 --> 01:24:15,940
大噉，我誒另外咧，亦都想提一提咧，就係我哋剛才頭先第一節咧嗰位誒，即係係尋求庇護嘅誒父母嘅嗰位小朋友誒，佢只係講咗一句説話，但係呢句説話係即係我諗係好多朋友都會覺得誒好係好觸動嘅。佢話：我就係想翻學啫。

393
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:35,950
嚇！我想翻學，但係一個七歲嘅小朋友啦，係未能夠翻到學。噉我相信咧，佢係應該係按照香港嘅而家嘅政策，係應該去翻到學嘅。但係點解佢翻唔到學咧？會唔會仲有啲類似嘅情況咧？而呢一個個案，佢而家係親身嚟到立法會呢度講畀我。

394
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:55,960
我哋知，我覺得我哋作為立法會議員啦，係唔可以即係即係當睇唔到嘅。我覺得即係呢位小朋友今同今日嘅嗰個主題兒童權利係即係非常之密切相關。我好希望咧，啊副局長可唔可以咧係即係主動去跟進呢一位小朋友嘅情況，咁然之後咧。

395
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:15,970
係能夠咧，稍後咧可以話到畀我哋知道咧，即係嗰個情況係點樣。我相信咧係即係喺呢度，大家頭先我同誒幾位官員咧傾嘅時候，大家其實好關心啊，即係誒，我覺得即係大家都係同樣嘅一個目標，希望咧係呢啲小朋友雖然佢係係喺一個噉嘅情況底下，但係。

396
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:47,450
誒誒跟進之後，希望你能夠咧。會會會，我哋會翻嚟同你報告翻畀我哋知。嚇嚇，好，我哋都會即係誒跟進呢個個案，又同誒無論勞科局或者呢個誒教育局，即係讀書嘅問題。當然，即係實質誒對於佢哋提供援。

397
01:25:47,450 --> 01:26:07,460
就通過社署誒外判咗畀國際社會服務社啦。噉，但係呢啲嘅團體，我哋都要就住呢個個案一定要跟進。就算係以一個政策嚟講，我哋都必須跟進。噉就頭先阿葉建元議員提到有咁多團體嚟到，無論書面或者係誒。

398
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:44,810
唔該，主席。阿吳生。

399
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,060
未必答到，我想講嘅就係，就係。

400
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,660
好，噉啊，跟住我哋就請郭佩凡議員。

401
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:13,910
唔同嘅需要啦嚇，咁所以誒，即係如果佢接觸我哋嗰個誒推人機構咧，佢會有服務提供畀佢哋嘅。

402
01:30:48,280 --> 01:31:03,840
我哋誒經過兩個誒專項機構去執行呢個服務啦嚇，噉佢哋亦都會上門去提供呢個誒支援嘅。有需要嘅時候咧，誒個個家庭如果有需要咧，係可以提供上門嘅支援。咁亦都會睇下佢有。

403
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:42,410
有項目專係去處理呢一個嘅問題㗎，噉你今日都聽到咁多兒童投訴，即係佢哋面對誒電腦學習，即係用電腦學習嘅困難，噉係咪代表而家你哋用緊嗰個誒即係方法或者做緊嘅項目係誒唔理想，需要全面去檢討咧？

404
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:27,470
今日嘅口頭嘅陳述咧，同埋我哋議員嘅關注咧，我覺得政府都係應該要誒正面回應。正如你所講咧，今日嚟嘅官員咧，未必有能力喺政策上咧作出相應嘅回應。呢個係我哋都感覺遺憾嘅，即係兒童貧窮呢。

405
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:47,480
呢件事咧喺好多國家嚟講咧，係會擺喺好優先喺政策上喺佢嘅政綱上面咧，都係一個好擺前嘅問題。但係我哋到立法會喺呢度開會，我哋亦都特登揀咗星期六，因為讓呢啲翻緊學嘅小朋友或者翻緊工嘅嘅家長。

406
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:21,060
咁所以，我要求咧，當局誒要作出一個整體嘅書面回應，即係就住我哋今天嘅陳述，同埋各位嘅誒書面嘅陳述誒，議員嘅關注，我哋喺呢幾方面誒，葉建源議員都總結得好好啦。基本生活、身心。

407
01:27:44,020 --> 01:28:04,030
多謝主席。咁首先多謝今日咁多嘅組織啦，誒誒，尤其小朋友啦，都出席誒今日嘅公聽會，講咗好多誒佢哋嘅意見畀我哋聽。咁誒，我相信我哋大家都好關心，即係其實誒貧窮兒童佢哋嘅身心精神健康啦、平等學習機會啦、基本生活。

408
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:24,040
需要啦，佢哋生活得開唔開心啦？誒，覺得未來有冇希望啦？係咪可以健康咁生活咧？都係我諗係我哋好關注同埋我哋希望做到嘅目標。咁當然我哋希望嚟緊即係誒政府成立兒童事務委員會咧，係誒可以深入咁瞭解今日即係所有朋友提出嘅。

409
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:44,050
嘅誒，所有呢啲問題跟住誒，即係做到有建設性嘅建議兼落實去執行。咁所以呢個咧就係我哋好關心呢個兒童事務委員會未來嗰個誒架構同埋誒，即係佢嗰個誒工作範疇。咁所以我都希望即係誒局方盡快咯，可以將即係兒童事務委員會未來嗰。

410
01:28:44,050 --> 01:29:04,060
嗰個誒做法、工作計劃、種種嘅資料咧，即係盡快就係誒向立法會去誒彙報，同埋同我哋討論，誒再聽大家嘅意見噉。咁今日咧聽到好多誒朋友提出嘅意見咧，其實好多都好具體嘅，主席，我相信我哋都都聽到係咪？即係誒，無論誒關注即係誒誒身體。

411
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:24,070
嘅健康嘅發展啊，定係其他種種噉就住今日提出咁多咁具體嘅誒建議咧，我都期望誒。我相信今日未必可以答得到嘅官員咧，都希望就住呢啲具體建議咧，佢哋可以列翻表，我哋一一回應誒。究竟未來打算點樣去誒tackle呢啲問題，即係點樣去處理呢啲問題？咁嗱，我我自己本身咧。

412
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:44,080
即係嚟自I.T.界啦，咁誒，我亦都一路都好關好關心，即係誒誒兒童啊小朋友去即係有冇平等嘅學習機會，噉啊點樣縮窄嘅數碼隔膜？呢個我做咗好多年，主席噉，所以今日咧，我又誒繼續聽到誒，即係嚟誒今日出席嘅小朋友提到。

413
01:29:44,080 --> 01:30:04,090
即係誒，佢哋學習上面嘅困難。今時今日個個都用電腦，唔用電腦咧就真係真係學習唔到，會即係誒擴闊咗個數碼隔膜，令到佢哋冇平等學習機會。呢個對佢哋未來嗰個發展，甚至影響佢哋嘅自信心啊，誒佢哋誒對即係週週圍整個社會嘅睇法都好重要。噉。

414
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:24,100
但係，我哋今日聽到好多好多投訴啊！電腦嘩嘩聲啊，龜速咁慢啊，做唔到功課啊，誒冇錢啊買啊等等。咁呢啲問題其實誒嗱，今日我哋都有個同事喺，有個政府官員喺度嘅政府資訊總監辦公室數碼共融啊，阿吳生都喺度。咁照計誒，我哋係有有。

415
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:34,440
嚇！主席，咁個問題係出喺邊度咧？嗱，我哋立法會又有撥資源去做誒呢個誒項目啦，嚇，去幫助誒貧窮兒童上網同埋用電腦。咁但係我哋仍然都不斷收到咁多投訴，尤其今日我哋有咁多小朋友嚟到呢度親身話畀你聽，搞唔掂嚇！噉係點咧？係係佢哋冇接觸到呢個。

416
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:54,450
資訊噉，如果佢哋唔知道原來係有資源係可以幫到佢哋嘅話，咁政府都係都係做得唔夠好啊，同埋都係失職。因為點解我哋有資源，而我哋啲小朋友攞唔到咧？定係其實你哋你哋啲項目嘅資源係幫唔到我哋啲小朋友去攞到？嗱，主席，其實我想講嘅咧，即係我相信今日官員。

417
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,570
啊，主席。

418
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,500
做唔做得唔夠好咧？好副局長。

419
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:51,130
即係話畀大家聽咧，誒，大家而家未connect。

420
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:17,240
意見咧寫畀兒童事務委員會，等佢哋去參考嘅呢個第一。另外第二咧就係。

421
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:24,370
啊，主席，我究竟即係今日嘅團體，佢哋可能有啲書面意見啊，係咪好遲先畀咧？定啊幾時畀？

422
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:28,660
之電腦只不過係其中一個例子，係政府可能有一啲服務，但係小朋友同埋啲家庭係攞唔到。

423
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:38,160
電腦係其中一樣，誒！佢哋而家話佢哋電腦嗡嗡聲，佢哋嘅電腦過速，佢哋冇錢買，唔係佢哋自己想去買。

424
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:53,960
好，啊副局長，或者我可能之後我再同啊港議員瞭解下佢哋具體情況，我再睇下有啲咩嘅服務嘅方面，我哋可以再瞭解佢哋需要，之後再睇下點樣加強個宣傳嗰方面啦嚇。

425
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:47,520
誒，主席，今日咧就兩輪嘅代表咧就嚟講咗佢哋對於兒童發展嗰個睇法。咁其實咧誒，佢哋講咗好多困難，但係誒，各方嘅回應咧就回應唔到佢哋嘅困難。

426
01:33:54,240 --> 01:34:12,600
我諗啊，郭議員係想你哋去檢視一下而家嗰啲嘅支援計劃，包括咗電腦嗰部分咧，係咪有一啲誒？無論係資訊不足，或者申請手續，或者係本身嗰個服務係未適合個需要。

427
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:31,680
定係咩原因？點解嗰個即係你哋有服務，好似樣樣都有，但係仍然有咁多小朋友、咁多家庭咧，就仍然係覺得支援不足。即係你係咪可以檢視一下呢個情況？我你翻去睇睇，我翻去睇睇。好，好，跟住請啊郭偉強。

428
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:17,560
政府係咪真係好好仔細咁去了解瞭解到我哋啲兒童嗰個需要，而佢哋係真係落實到執行到嗱，佢哋年年都嚟立法會向我哋報告話做咗呢樣做咗嗰樣，咁但係做得幾多做得幾好咧？誒，我哋其實真係需要有實質啲嘅嘅衡量個方法。如如果我哋活咗。

429
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:37,570
資源有項目，而小朋友係攞唔到嘅話咧，呢個又更加大問題。咁個問題係出喺邊度咧？咁政府都要檢討，唔可以容許呢個問題繼續存在噉啊。咁而電腦只不過係其中一一番啫，仲有其他嘅。當我哋問親問題，好多政府部門都會話：我哋已經有呢啲服務，呢有啲服務。但係點解我哋今日出席嘅？

430
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:57,610
嘅朋友同埋出邊，其實仲有好多家長同小朋友都話佢哋攞唔到呢啲服務咧。咁呢一個都係啊啊，即係政府需要回應我哋嘅問題咯。噉我諗啊啊啊副局長係咪都可以回應一下？點解我哋有服務而出邊又攞唔到？係宣傳推廣不足啊，定係接觸唔到佢哋啊？定係其實啲服

431
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:21,220
嗯，頭先頭先，阿吳生都都講過，一有好多可能啲家庭佢未必需要，自己會用自己渠道去買。咁當然，如果係即係要再做宣傳，我諗可以再做多啲嘅。咁但係我睇下阿吳生有冇其他補充嚇。主席，我唔係我唔係講呢樣嘢。我諗阿阿副部長聽唔聽到我個問題？我個問題係。

432
01:34:51,690 --> 01:35:11,700
未聯繫得上，咁嚟緊嗰個兒童事務委員會究竟係咪可以幫助到connect翻咧？呢個大家係有個問號嘅。咁但係我覺得，誒頭先有啲同事就擺咗喺嗰個組成嗰度啦。噉我覺得，就算無論組成點都好啦，其實今日嚟發表嘅團體咧，仍然可以將。

433
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,660
誒特別係大家關心到。

434
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:41,700
由少數族裔啊，由誒一啲誒即係庇護嘅人士啊，等等等等咩都有。

435
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:09,640
誒誒做守龍門嘅角色咧，如果呢個未搞清楚嘅話咧，其實再拗落去咧都唔會有啲咩大進展嘅。

436
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:41,910
一定要搞清楚呢啲基本嘢搞唔清楚嘅話咧，大家就喺度即係有啲吹水嘅意味。咁同埋咧就係誒。

437
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:35,110
部門點解做唔切反應咧？即係冇針對性去回應佢哋嘅訴求。咁同埋，我覺得誒，當然佢哋提嘅範疇好闊啊，樣樣都有誒。

438
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:17,730
局方諗住做幾多嘢，做啲咩嘢？如果局方有困難嘅話，點解一路都冇講到佢有啲咩困難咧？即係政府嗰方面啊，咁呢啲困難係咪好秘密嘅嘢，所以唔講得咧？即係希望都能夠回應啦，多謝主席。

439
01:36:42,200 --> 01:37:00,830
大家都關心就係誒，當貧富完全影響到下一代嘅時候，影響到大家嘅機會，而呢個機會唔係一次半次，而係終生嘅機會。每個時刻都要會都會可能誒遇到唔唔對等啊，或者係唔係同一個起跑線嘅時候。

440
01:35:41,980 --> 01:36:01,990
噉，但係佢哋個大方向就係講緊喂，我哋兒童嗰個權利不等於福利呢個信息，究竟局方有時冇真係回應嘅喎？究竟你認唔認同你一套先？即係你都覺得係冇錯，權利我哋做得唔夠。點解話唔係？我哋仍然都係覺得福利，我哋繼續誒。

441
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:32,950
誒貧窮兒童，誒個數字好驚人啦，十八萬。咁局方或啲部門對於呢十八萬嘅數字又點理解嘅咧？佢哋有冇一個目標，就係我要減少幾多，或者我要幫到幾多，做到幾多？又係冇聽到嘅喎。噉我覺得呢啲基本嘢一。

442
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:38,040
好啊！啊，徐副局長。O.K.啊，誒誒，都係啊，主席啊，區議員誒。頭先我哋都提過咧，就住就住扶貧呢一方面，我哋係重視噉。我相信扶貧委會嚟緊都會有啲新嘅公佈方向。咁誒，就住呢個誒，即係打擊即係貧窮或者。

443
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:58,050
係舒緩呢個part嘅貧窮嚇。頭先我都講過，即係我哋都係希望鼓勵就業噉，所以頭先我都講，我哋喺嗰個低收入家庭津貼，去到我哋而家優化裏邊嗰個細節，都希望可以幫助到有能力工作嘅人士嚇，可以誒透過就業嚇，可以幫佢哋可以脱貧。咁但係我都頭先亦都誒。

444
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:18,060
之前亦都係已經講過，誒喺我哋綜援嗰方面亦都係一個網安全網啦。噉，其餘喺關愛基金，我哋會繼續發揮我哋嘅工作，噉啊，制定更多新嘅啲先導計劃。噉係誒睇下，如果我哋喺證實喺一個扶貧成效係誒有效，而我哋希望可以將一啲先導計劃。

445
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:38,070
恆常化呢幾方面一齊去做。當然，我我哋頭先所講呢啲以外，我頭先都有提到就係嗰個跨界別嗰個協作都好重要。即係例如，我哋今日新聞報告提到，我哋誒葵積扶養基金嘅注資四億，嚇咁誒當中亦都已經係幫助十三萬基層兒童。噉啊，另外義服基金噉啊，另外注資三億。咁當

446
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:58,080
中呢啲其實我頭先都講過啦，咁所以都唔唔唔繼續誒再誒重複噉，但係都要特別提就係我哋例如幫助呢個婦女誒，佢哋如果係誒因為要照顧小朋友嗰方面，所以我哋喺誒嗰個課餘託管啊呢幾方面我都加強咗噉，同埋我哋下年年頭我哋嘅幼兒照顧嗰個長規劃都會係。

447
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,740
啊！動力同埋能力。

448
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:25,590
仲有兩位議員想第二輪嘅，噉我想徵詢徵詢大家意見，我延長多十分鐘得唔得咧？

449
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:09,620
誒，我都因為我正話應承咗啲小朋友咧，同埋啲團體咧，我係要將我要討論呢個兒童發展基金，所以我一定要多一分鐘咧去提出我嘅問題。

450
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:39,050
如果大家準許好，多謝各位。噉我哋延長到係啦，誒到五十五分。噉啊，邵家臻同葉建源議員都想繼續，我哋誒。

451
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:37,300
誒，我由低温講，我而家都係咁講嘅啦。即係你哋用誒儲錢呢個方法咧，但係而家嗰啲貧窮嘅兒童咧，佢唔係冇動力儲錢，佢係冇能力儲錢。

452
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:24,610
區基教為本啊嗰啲嘢，咁但係係咪真係覺得十年過去啦？係咪真係需要定一定誒一個兒童發展基金嗰個嘅誒誒操作上嘅操作嘅模式應該點樣樣咧？第二點咧就係誒原則嘅問題。

453
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:18,090
幾有新嘅同大家報告，數嗰啲加。主席啊，我諗大家都明㗎啦，即係其實阿局方咧，佢哋而家只係能夠講自己做咗啲咩，佢唔係好回應到人哋話佢未做好嗰啲咧，佢佢回應唔到。咁同埋咧，我覺得都係嗰個概念嘅問題啦。即係好似我哋講標示一樣咧，其實頭先好多與會者講得好好啊。

454
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:38,100
小朋友就係誒，佢除咗誒要學習、要玩之外，家長陪到佢幾多時間都係重要㗎嘛。咁但係其實誒政府而家係冇考慮㗎嘛，即係當你同佢講標示嘅時候，佢就係同你講老闆搞唔掂數、請唔掂人啊，人手有問題，所以佢就唔諗啦。即係點樣將？

455
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:58,110
誒家庭將兒童將打工仔嘅即係職安排稱先啲，而唔係將老闆嘅嘅能力稱先啲，或者係將來嘅人力需求稱先啲，係呢個問題啫嘛。邊樣稱先啲嘅問題啫嘛？如果佢唔搞清楚呢樣嘢嘅話咧，其實你每問佢一樣，佢都係答翻佢做錯嘅嘢，都係絕情。冇錯。

456
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:18,120
多謝個議員。不過佢哋個表述都係誒個潛台詞都係誒老闆嗰個利益經濟係行先嘅，就先於我哋兒童嘅需要啦。誒，除非政府唔同意佢佢，否則應該要講清楚。咁誒時間咧就夠啦，我。

457
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:59,340
繼續每人五分鐘，係啊，邵家聰議員。多謝主席，我儘量短啦。我諗我唔使五分鐘啊。好誒，正話嗰個牛頭不揦馬嘴嘅嘅狀態咧，係我唔知係咪我心情好疲累咧。我覺得今日好似特別嚴重啊，比起過往嗰啲誒公聽會誒官員嘅反應咧，係更加不不不揦馬嘴。但係我同

458
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:29,910
誒兒童發展基金咧，誒我想提直接提出一啲有幾個一個操作嘅問題，一個原則嘅問題。誒操作嘅問題咧就係咧，而家咧誒由零八年到而家咧整清十年啦嚇，個個個基金咁咧就當然我哋都期望你講清楚究竟呢十年究竟佢覺你覺得佢滿唔滿意啦嚇。不過咧喺操作。

459
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:49,920
上咧就誒唔同嘅唔同嘅operator咧，由四個人到十二人都有嚇。呢個又係好似footband噉樣咧。誒，因為你唔你唔界定緊究竟要用咩人手去做，或者用啲乜嘢嘅即係誒誒誒規格去做。結果而家嘅操作咧就係由四個至十二個都有，而而誒每一個。

460
01:41:49,920 --> 01:42:09,930
社工咧都唔會係全時間做呢一樣嘢，咁咧就但係呢個暫時冇乜所謂啊。但係如果你已經係佢已經經歷到十年咧，都唔能夠誒定一個standard嘅一個操作嘅模式咧，我覺得咧係有一啲一定有遺憾嘅地方喺度嚇。噉你未想呢種情況好自由彈性噉樣，你一定會美化話呢啲又話機構為主啊嗰啲。

461
01:42:40,020 --> 01:43:00,030
一字之差，但係概念好完殊。誒，你哋就不斷話誒每個月誒兩年內每個月儲二百，跟住咧就會有三千蚊獎勵。呢一呢一種噉嘅做法，好似一種鼓勵嚇。你你哋就針對緊佢哋個動力，你覺可以彷彿佢講緊佢哋咧，有啲錢咧攞嚟使曬噉樣樣嚇，跟住咧。

462
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:20,040
就唔食唔儲，於是你鼓勵佢儲，但係其實壓根抵疑咧。呢個唔係淨係動力嘅問題，呢個真係一個能力問題。對於貧窮嘅人嚟講，要儲二百蚊唔係唔得啊。不過唔得，亦都好容易明白。即係話誒，主席咧提咗個字咧，唔係就佢唔係提誇大貧窮嘅，佢係提貧窮循。

463
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:40,050
環嘅poverty cycle貧窮循環，而家係循環緊嘅輪，而家係循環緊。不過只不過係唔會循到去你哋嗰邊嘅啫嚇。但係對對當事人嚟講，佢係循來循去，循來循去嚇。可能越可能好似螺絲噉樣，越越轉越低，唔係越轉越高。咁所以誒，我都想提出咧。

464
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,630
好，阿邵家章議員，唔好意思，都係。

465
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:55,770
我相信未能夠回應到你嘅問題，係啊葉建宇議員。

466
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:10,610
噉樣去誒被逼被鼓勵啊嚇去儲錢，咁咧呢個呢個就係誒正話啲團體講，或者係國議覺得好啱。究竟你點睇權利同埋福利？

467
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:09,790
誒，我今日未必能夠詳細咁講，但係誒誒，與會嘅朋友咧係的確係帶咗個噉嘅誒訊息畀我哋咧，我哋需要留意嘅。另外一個問題咧，就係頭先啊郭佩凡議員都提到咧，就係。

468
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:46,710
其實我哋睇到之前個報告係佢啲兄弟姊妹喺參加，即係佢有啲兄弟姊妹參加咗呢一個嘅program之後，佢哋都對於讀書，佢哋都對於自己人生規劃有一個好正面嘅影響。咁所以即係我搭搭搭住呢度先講易容眼鏡啊～

469
01:43:40,050 --> 01:44:00,060
呢個原則嘅問題，第二最尾一點咧，就係因為你一早定咗咧呢一個兒童發展基金咧，同貧窮有關，咁咧就多多少少令到咧呢個羅章局長都成日提話，唔好有呢個標籤效應。但係呢個兒童發展基金咧，就有一個污名化嘅效應，有個標籤效應，啊唔窮嘅人咧就唔需要參加呢個基金，就唔需要。

470
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:30,900
嚇！你你冇即係話又唔答啦，係咪又冇答過啦嚇？但係呢個就係啊嘛。如果係權利嘅話，而咁呢個就噉樣就真係全面嘅去污名化。喺福利嘅話，誒好難好難擺擺擺脱嗰個污名。唔該，主席。好，徐副局長。係，多謝主席。誒，先先講講嗰個融發基金嗰個。

471
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:50,910
嗰個效應其實，我之前係做咗啲研究，咁其實睇得到咧。誒，即係而家好多小朋友，如果你話要幫佢哋脱離嗰個循環，其中一個就係佢哋嗰網絡。因為嗱，我哋如果我我唔再數，就係話我哋本身政府，我哋有好多唔同嘅支援去幫佢哋，從教育啊、誒、宣佈津貼啊等等數落去都係有好多。

472
01:44:50,910 --> 01:45:10,920
咁但係亦都係講緊，就係話，當我哋有基本嗰個甚免免費教育，我哋去到有基本津貼，我哋有曬呢啲嘢之後，下一個就唔係講緊錢，就係講緊嗰個社區網絡。咁所以點解我哋今次喺嗰個油費基金，我哋另外注資就係睇得到真係可以幫到呢班小朋友，佢哋重視咗讀書教育，可以點樣幫到佢哋？

473
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:30,930
同一時間就係話你誒儲錢其實係一個係一個係一個好重要嘅habit，即係一個一個習慣性。點樣亦都係畀到佢嗰個配對，即係講緊就係喺個兒童基金裏邊，我落過去睇過好多呢啲噉樣嘅case，去到一啲成功嘅例子，就係唔單止係就參與嘅小朋友，佢哋有一個正面影響。

474
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:16,090
誒主席誒有幾點？一點咧就係誒今日咧係我哋第二節咧，特別係嚇咁咧就誒比較多咧係提到少數族裔嘅嗰個問題。噉就誒呢一個咧，我覺得係誒踏入咗即係呢十幾年咧，我哋一個新嘅現象嚟嘅。過去咧，我哋喺香港。

475
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:36,100
居住嘅外國人咧，就用國際學校嚟到去處理啦。於是咧，佢哋同我哋嗰個生活咧喺教育上面，喺生活上面咧，可能都係一個平衡嘅時空噉。咁但係咧，其實係而家越嚟越多嘅誒，即係外國人，包括咧係我哋而家關少數族裔或者其他嘅嘅國家嘅人士咧。

476
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:56,110
誒，佢哋都想係同個主流社會係融入嘅。咁呢一個咧係誒，就我哋過去咧，往往咧就會比較上咧關注到，即係學習中文嘅問題。但係今日咧，我哋都留意到啦，係誒，譬如話包括咧誒，已經嚟即係誒走咗啦，有位咧係啊啊。

477
01:46:56,110 --> 01:47:16,120
女同學咧，菲律賓嚟嘅，啊，Miss，Steen，Williams咧，就講到佢係好想誒融入香港嘅生活，同香港嘅本地嘅小朋友一齊。噉佢就講到一個隔離嘅一個問題。噉啊，其實好多位朋友咧都提到呢個隔離嘅問題。噉佢係用親身嘅經驗嚟講。咁呢個。

478
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:36,130
隔離嘅現象咧，就其實咧喺我哋教育裏頭咧都要諗嘅，就係即係除咗你話學中文之外，誒點樣能夠咧係喺香港嘅主流學校裏頭咧？誒佢係可以不去到不同嘅學校嗰度啦，誒唔會係即係過度集中喺一啲學校度。另外咧就係具體嘅生活課上面咧。

479
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:56,140
會唔會出現一啲嘅即係隔離嘅現象咧？咁呢度咧係需要我哋好多老師啊，好多嘅校長啊，同埋咧，我哋成個即係教育嘅管理層咧，我哋都需要有一個噉嘅嘅留留心。誒喺一啲微觀嘅問題上面咧，係去介入去處理。咁呢個咧就即係誒。

480
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:30,080
我哋好多嘅服務咧，其實提供緊嘅，但係咧似乎又唔到位噉。譬如話，今日咧，我哋嘅會議嘅討論文件咧，其實係有幾個附件嘅。附件一、附件二裏頭有三個表嘅，裏頭有好多好多嘅服務嘅計劃咧，係做緊嘅。咁呢啲計劃其實，

481
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,500
係可以有幫助嚇，呢個一個即係好簡單嘅建議。

482
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:26,730
再太多啦！呢啲濕濕税嘅嘅項目咧，係由申請嘅方，即係即係唔同嘅誒機構去管理，唔同嘅方向去申請。誒，所以咧，我覺得係咪可以咧？誒誒，又勞煩啦，副局長啦。

483
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:50,090
實，我哋嘅誒有需要嘅朋友知唔知道嘅咧咁誒？仲有咧就係我自己作為即係以前嘅嚇，我以前都係喺學校裡頭教書嘅。我自己經驗咧就係作為老師咧，都未必知道曬有呢啲噉嘅項目嘅。咁有啲項目咧係我可能教完曬誒一年之後咧，跟住我先發覺咦，我同學。

484
01:48:50,090 --> 01:49:10,100
想申請嘅某啲放活動，原來原來有某個基金係去提供嘅噉，我我其實可以幫佢申請嘅，但係我唔知。於是咧，中間有啲所謂agents咧，即係一啲重要嘅嘅誒人士咧，其實佢係唔知道家長唔知道誒，可能老師唔知道，校長都未必知道曬，因為實在。

485
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:47,020
誒，其實我哋係有冇辦法咧，係將呢啲資料咧係編排曬佢咧，係成為一個清單。我哋嘅家長嗱，中英文例如話，即係即係唔同嘅語言嘅人士咧，佢係可以喺網上面可以睇得到嘅，可以有單張可以咧係一覽無遺嘅。

486
01:49:47,020 --> 01:50:07,030
我哋嘅，譬如話，前線嘅老師或者社工，佢都可以拎住一份清單或者一張單張，佢大約知道有啲咩嘢嘢。佢跟住咧，誒，知道去邊度申請，知道幾時有申請，知道咧係邊啲人係可以受益者，亦都可以將佢分開做幾個層次嘅。譬如話，學前嘅小朋友、幼稚園嘅小朋友，誒誒，幼稚園前。

487
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:27,040
嘅即係幼兒嘅階段、幼稚園嘅階段、小學嘅階段、中學嘅階段，跟住咧大專階段或者其他社會即係誒階段。即係我諗呢啲嘅資料嘅好嘅編排咧，我相信係會對誒即係誒呢服務咧係到位誒，令到更多人咧係可以使用得到咧。

488
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:51,050
好，啊徐副局長有冇回應？我誒聽到聽議員嘅意見，咁誒我哋會再再檢視一下，睇下我哋。我印象中我哋有好多，尤其是我哋起碼喺誒社署嗰方面嘅呢啲服務啊，啲簡介都已經update咗，都有唔同嘅語言。因為尤其是好多少數族裔，佢哋會有佢哋誒嘅申請，佢哋需要語文上。噉我哋會翻去再。

489
01:50:51,050 --> 01:51:11,060
再睇多次啦。咁主席，即係我頭先佢講嘅就係，因為我哋好多啊。係嚇，我哋希林有冇一個即係誒嗱喺好多之上有一個一男嘅，即係比較清楚嘅啊。其實咧係我哋有幾種唔同嘅需要嘅，譬如基層又好，少數族裔又好，誒特殊教需要又好，誒。

490
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:31,070
同埋咧係誒基層嘅一般嘅嘅嘅貧窮嘅小朋友，即係佢哋能夠得到嘅服務。誒，如果佢有一個一覽表嘅話咧，噉我諗就唔需要咧係去不同嘅位置嗰度咧搜查不同嘅錢，因為佢哋未必知道咧喺邊度揾到。明明白嘅啊，主席，其實都都想特別講一講，就係誒，即係我哋今日聽。

491
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:51,080
聽到好多唔同嘅意見，同埋其實好多誒基層兒童甚至係家長面對好多嘅問題。咁呢啲其實好多都係屬於跨部門噉，所以亦都正正係睇得到我嚟緊嗰個兒童事務委員會。我哋先有個跨，即係嗰個誒前期，我哋睇下將來個組成係點樣樣。呢個就係我哋要點。

492
01:51:51,080 --> 01:52:11,090
點樣用唔同嘅局，我哋要坐低去傾。即係頭先阿葉議員講到就係話，誒我哋其實有好多嘢可能跨部門，亦都係有噉樣嘅需要。咁所以呢一方面就係我哋嚟緊將來嘅工作裏邊會會去睇。咁同埋嚟緊我哋都會有好多供諮詢，所以呢度亦都會係有議員嘅參與。頭先我哋所講啊，唔同嘅字範就係包。

493
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:31,100
包括兒童，咁呢個都係我哋將來嘅方向。咁當然，誒喺我哋誒下年成立咗之後嘅時候，我哋會再具體。不過而家我哋會先就住我哋用事務委員會嗰個嘅重點方向組成呢啲，我哋會先做咗呢個誒即係公眾諮詢先。咁然之後下年喺成立咗，由呢個政務司司長去chair嚇嗰。

494
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:51,110
時咧，我哋就會再再聚焦去去，真係係解決你頭先提到嘅問題，同埋定一啲目標同埋政策誒方向嘅。即係如果你能夠係帶翻去兒童發展委員會嗰度去傾，我諗都好嘅。不過其實呢個咧，亦都其實我覺得誒簡相對地簡單嘅，亦都係你諗下可唔可以即時可以去。

495
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,770
係。

496
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:33,820
你畀佢係一啲福利噉樣。

497
01:53:54,110 --> 01:54:11,910
呢一屆政府咧，能夠誒有一個噉樣嘅願景。咁當然我哋對於兒童事務委員會有個寄望嘅，咁睇下你幾時會公佈嗰個誒諮詢嗰個計劃啦。希望盡快聽到啦。噉就如今日所講嘅。

498
01:52:51,110 --> 01:53:11,120
回應同埋處理嚇。好，局長你考慮一下啦。我估今日我哋誒同事講咗，同埋與會者講咗有幾樣嘢啦。誒，嗰個暢達咧，即係服務嘅暢達，嘅accessibility，即係唔係淨係物理上嘅暢達，而係嗰個服務擺咗喺度，係咪有需要嘅人？

499
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:31,130
用到呢個好緊要噉，我覺得你哋要檢視下，即係有啲咩辦法去改善嗰方面。另外就係誒好多好幾位同事都講咗啲原則問題，包括咗即係兒童嗰個權利誒，定係你哋覺得誒呢啲貧窮兒童。

500
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:54,110
咁更加重要就係其實就住貧窮兒童呢樣嘢本身，我哋覺得最好就消滅呢個貧窮啦。咁有啲地方係會有好多國家係會有個清楚嘅目標嘅，咁但係我哋就冇啦。噉我哋都希望即係呢個呢。

501
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:32,300
啊！求先葉建源議員嘅綜合得好好嘅，就係有關基層細路仔啦、特殊教育小朋友啦、誒非華語少數族裔嘅學生啦，或者誒兒童啦，同埋一啲尋求庇護嘅兒童咧，其實都面臨好幾方面嗰個需要。噉我希望即係誒。

502
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:52,310
誒嚟緊，你哋會盡快畀翻一個書面嘅全面全面回應我哋。咁至於兒童事務委員會嗰個誒組成咧，我哋都會誒可能喺呢一個誒小組委員會都會再跟進嘅。嚇咁今日咧就多謝大家嘅出席，我哋嘅會議到此為。
