1
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,170
坐喺度係啦。

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,770
阿李生。

3
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,410
長官。

4
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,640
各位議員同埋。

5
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,210
即係我冇執葉象牙咧，都好耐啦。

6
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,130
即係我係以前做象牙嘅。

7
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,200
請你對住個麥講下，啊，喂喂。

8
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,890
啊，各位啊，請你哋睇翻你個名牌，你個座位度有你個名牌個名嘅。

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
Please take your seats. The seats are marked with your name. Welcome, everyone.

10
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:22,030
好啦，而家啱啱好曬一點零一分啦。噉我就誒請翻第一位咧係啊上一節未發言嘅阿李佳允先生先，你有三分鐘嘅李先生，唔該曬。

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:18,520
That is the original version. Channel one is the Cantonese version, channel two is the English version, and channel three is the普通話version.

12
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:52,540
會綜合大樓會議室出席會議或在公眾席旁聽會議嘅公眾人士須知呢一個嘅文件。咁呢份文件咧，應該係你嘅誒枱面上面，或者係或者係已經係啊寄咗畀你哋㗎啦。

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:07,100
三部分到普通話版本。誒，I just want to remind participants that there there are a few channels for you to listen to simultaneous interpretation. Channel zero is the live broadcast.

14
00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:11,470
啊！如果你哋係有一啲發言稿係未畀呢一個委員會嘅啦，你哋可以將呢啲發言稿寫上你哋嘅姓名咧，係喺呢一個誒會議之後咧，啊交畀我哋嘅誒同事喺呢度嘅同事。

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:50,610
好啦，再一次歡迎各團體同埋個人同埋誒各位嚟到呢一次嘅公聽會啦。噉我提一提大家咧喺你誒個個座位前邊咧就有幾個嘅唔同嘅頻道嘅。啊零號頻道就係現場嘅版本，一號頻道廣東話版本，二號頻道英文版。

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:38,950
啊！再提一提各位咧，誒，你哋今日每人嘅發言時間係三分鐘，請你掌握好嘅啊，你哋嘅時間，同埋你哋嘅發言同埋意見書咧，都唔會受到立法會權力同埋特權條例嘅保障，亦都請你哋留意喺立法會。

17
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,750
噉。

18
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,840
即係財產嘅。

19
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,070
挑黑象牙咧！

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,270
我今日嚟講嘅嘢咧。

21
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,120
嘅國寶嚟嘅。

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,060
即係出口嘅錢啊！

23
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,650
所以為香港咧帶來好多嘅。

24
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,470
今日張牙香港唔係中國都冇冇仗。

25
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,180
有記載㗎，你哋可以查一查，有歷史嘅。

26
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,590
一九一六啊，一八年七一七年嗰時候。

27
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,730
象牙咧係咪中國會殺象咧？

28
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,120
即係大家都冠軍、亞軍、冠軍、亞軍。

29
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,290
因為我覺得咧，就中國一個藝術。

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,510
就同呢個職業，即係報職業嗰啲啊！

31
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:14,090
象牙咧，同埋出口咧，同埋呢個誒象牙嘅出口貨咧。

32
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:02,200
即係我記得咧，就一九一六年，一九八六。

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,670
點會殺象啊！

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,930
我認為。

35
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,590
中國人。

36
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,850
我記得。

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,650
好多地方都有跳啊！

38
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,410
中國嘅象牙球。

39
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,760
盜竊我哋中國嘅雕刻藝術品。

40
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,480
中國個象牙球咧，用水煲。

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,270
但係，我覺得即係禁住象牙雕刻咧。

42
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,960
啊，同呢個日本有一個比拼嘅。

43
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,560
同中國象牙球咧都有得比，咁兩個比賽。

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,650
係一種好污衊啊！我哋中國嘅藝術雕刻。

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,720
我哋啊，點解會嗱？好似跳下誒嗰陣時，日本又跳下。

46
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:31,530
但係中國嘅TikTok點解會被滅亡啊？被針對啊？就係因為佢哋。

47
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,680
嘅比拼咧，就係話大家都係挑個象牙球，但係日本嗰個象牙球咧。

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,130
都唔能夠保護我哋中國嘅藝術雕刻咧，經常係一種好冇面。我哋香港人。

49
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,230
唔能夠話，誒。

50
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,970
第二點就係立法對年輕人嘅影響。

51
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,990
第一，立法係咪依從基本法原則嘅咧？

52
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,660
所以，我覺得我哋係中國人，應該要保護我哋中國嘅挑客。

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,680
主席，各位議員，大家好，我係第七屆香港小特首劉影婷。

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,930
舊年梁特首曾經邀請我哋一班小特首去到禮賓府嗰度，探討有關環保嘅事宜。

55
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,950
政府冇正確噉樣指引同埋教育下一代，令我哋千年嘅國粹蒙羞，係唔妥當嘅做法。

56
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:16,950
保育係好重要嘅，但係大前提係必須不抵觸基本法同埋履行公義。

57
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:40,240
要因應國際趨勢，香港應該需要跟從。香港身為特別行政區，係冇任何嘅必要性去跟從任何一個國家嘅法例。

58
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:31,730
人哋殺象，嗱，好似而家，我覺得啲人話殺一啲象。啊，唔好意思啦，時間夠啦。咁下一位咧係阿劉影婷小姐，阿劉小姐唔該。

59
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:12,470
唔爛，日本嗰個上牙咧一煲佢就爛咗，就因為佢用膠黐，即係唔夠中國嘅原裝出品咁有藝術品。

60
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:24,380
社會將合法嘅象牙同埋非法獵殺混為一談，誤導年輕嘅下一代，使知道千年嘅中華牙雕藝術文化有偏見。

61
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:13,050
象牙雕刻藝術係歷史悠久嘅中華文化國粹，喺二零一四年被列為非物質文化遺產。然而近代嘅象牙藝術竟然被抹黑同埋扭曲。

62
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:30,480
基本法提到保護私人財產，政府此行立法係等同於叫業界人士嘅私人財產化為烏有。如果係噉嘅話，特首嘅回應就變得可圈可點啦。

63
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:54,760
香港政府如果盲目咁跟隨國際趨勢而忽視咗基本法原則嘅話，只會令到好多嘅市民對港人治港失去信心。特區政府係唔應該畀外國嘅勢力牽著鼻走嘅。

64
00:05:45,210 --> 00:06:03,770
當時我哋留意到本地象牙貿易即將面臨無常淘汰，咁所以咧，我哋就就此事去詢問特首對立法嘅意見。佢嘅回應係話呢一個立法係因應國際趨勢，而香港應該需要跟從。佢嘅答案就引發我思考以下幾點。

65
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,880
最後。

66
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,300
誒，主席好。

67
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,690
保育。

68
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,100
其實唔係一個必需品嚟。

69
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,480
其實係一個好重要嘅環節。

70
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,530
象牙嘅雕刻藝術，其實我哋。

71
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,600
政府嘅形象會唔會因為立法而受損咧？

72
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,780
以將啊，我哋係咪一個必需品？

73
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,700
咁頭先都聽到有啲聲音話誒。

74
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,610
中國挑黑嘅藝術唔單止喺象牙嗰度，可以喺其他地方。

75
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,850
你揸住對象牙筷子食嗰碗飯，係咪會好食啲？唔係嘅。

76
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,670
同埋矛盾，多謝各位。好，唔該曬。下一位，香港廚師聯盟嘅吳志輝先生，吳生，唔該你。

77
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:47,950
關心社會各階層人士，去聆聽唔同嘅聲音，相信係我小特首嘅責任，但係更加係香港政府嘅責任。

78
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:57,990
喺而家呢個時候，對於呢個立法，社會上面有好多唔同嘅回響。當下政府似乎仲未可以就立法同社會達成共識。

79
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:59,510
好似我哋而家有啲人食緊嘅魚翅，濫捕濫殺啲魚，我哋海洋，我哋嘅食物鏈會構成一個好嚴重嘅破壞。

80
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:18,440
倘若政府執意強行立法，恐怕只會造成社會更多對政府嘅不滿同埋控訴，有損特區政府以民為本嘅形象，對政府日後嘅施政係百害而無一利。所以在此還請政府三思，以免造成社會更多嘅撕裂。

81
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,340
所以我係絕對贊成。

82
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,980
我哋唔可以扼殺咗。

83
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,870
我哋共同喺呢個地球上邊生活嘅。

84
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,190
呢啲係人啊，人之本啊！

85
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,560
都應該享有生存嘅權利。

86
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,700
其實每一日動物，每一日生物。

87
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,530
冇市場，就唔會有呢個需要。

88
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,270
我哋絕對係禁止象牙市場買賣。

89
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,010
亦都應該係要加重嘅罰則。

90
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,910
我哋唔應該係去扼殺咗佢嘅生存。

91
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,720
喺地球生存上嘅每一種生物，每一種動物。

92
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,020
如果冇市場，就唔會有濫暴，唔會有濫殺。

93
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,450
所以其實我係絕對贊成去修改呢個法例。

94
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,860
咁先至可以阻止到，唔會再去啲大笨象，唔會再去被濫殺濫捕。

95
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:19,450
一一難佢就話：，如果係古董就可以入口啦。其實我覺得都係唔應該。

96
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:11,410
修改呢條法例，亦都係停止所有象牙嘅貿易買賣及禁止入口。咁當我睇到一條法。

97
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,630
所以。

98
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,890
點解我哋唔可以同佢共存咧？

99
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,180
到底政府係搞啲咩咧？

100
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,910
我本人係絕對贊成修改呢一條法例。

101
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,460
我哋靈長動物，我哋有思想有思考，我哋應該可以同佢哋共存嘅。

102
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,700
點解唔斬釘截鐵咧？點解每一次嘅立法會唔同嘅立法都要留一條尾巴咧？

103
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:01,720
呢個誒誒金錢上嘅賠償，另外咧亦都係要求咧係有呢個增加個罰則。

104
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:33,930
唔單止係係呢呢誒嘢，其實喺香港嘅夠鍾啦嚇。下一位邵鵬柱教授，邵教授唔該，係誒多謝主席。

105
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:11,600
同時間，我亦都希望唔好話將咩古董嘅象牙就可以納入去，就可以進口。其實好荒謬呢樣嘢。

106
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:50,880
喺誒九零年誒公約之後咧嚇，嗰個誒誒瀕危絕種野生動物《全物公約》啊，《納約》喺九六誒九零年之後咧，嗰個嘅象牙貿易咧，其實

107
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:22,780
咁所以嚟講，我覺得依個對我哋嘅聲譽係好唔好嘅嚇。咁另外咧就係中國大陸咧，其實喺今年年底咧已經係誒取替依個象牙貿易啊。噉我哋應該亦都要急起直追嚇。

108
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:37,040
佢依個障礙，當然係一部分，亦都係因為嗰個佢生態環境嘅轉變啦。但係誒調查所得咧，係以暴殺係為主嘅。嚇，第二咧就香港其實咧就誒已經係。

109
00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:08,510
已經咧係係好少啦，而且係係誒喺誒誒出口方面嘅貿易咧已經係好少㗎啦。咁但係咧，香港一直以嚟咧都被人咧救病咧係利用呢個啊，我哋咧係做一啲嘅誒偷運嘅誒情況啊。

110
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:54,220
誒，我係誒代表誒漁農自然護理署保護稀有動植物諮詢委員會誒畀啲意見嘅。經過我哋委員會討論之後咧，我哋係贊成政府係立依個法例，係包括咧係誒取替依個象牙嘅貿易，亦都咧唔會係有。

111
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:22,190
誒個理由咧就係有幾點嘅。第一咧就的確嚟講咧，依個大帳嘅誒數目咧係每況愈下嚇。就亦都好多時候咧就誒根據嗰個調查咧係因為誒依個暴殺啊而令到誒要。

112
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:43,070
第三咧就係二零一六年喺《瀕危啊絕種野生動植物國際貿易公約》締約國大會裏邊咧，亦都建議所有締約國同埋非締約國咧，應該盡快關閉依個象牙貿易啊。所以我哋我我哋作為其中一個嘅成員咧，應該係要遵從依個嘅指引嘅。

113
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,830
係啊！

114
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,680
Thank you.

115
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,370
Can you speak closer to the microphone, please?

116
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,730
Mr. Chair and committee committee members, I'll just emphasise my closing again in English.

117
00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:00,400
香港是亞洲的世錦，但它的 reputaion 已經被血鴛鴦交易。

118
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:09,200
華盛頓物種公約也在去年十月大會通過決議，建議世界各國關閉象牙市場。

119
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:39,050
但係，我覺得咧都係有一定嘅理據，咁希望咧就有關嘅部門咧係可以同呢個業界同埋各個持份者咧繼續溝通嚇，令到呢個法律唔該曬下位國際人道對待動物協會何燕青女士，何女士唔該。

120
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:27,800
我過去曾經在非洲做過卧底調查，盜獵者還有非法商人説他們很高興在亞洲，呃，看到這個象牙非常的受歡迎。我那時候一隻手握着盜獵的象牙，一邊忍住的淚水，我心裏是無比的傷心跟慚愧。

121
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:19,530
I have just one simple message to the ivory traders: stop hiding behind the so-called Chinese tradition. Animal cruelty, extinction and criminal criminal activities have no place in Hong Kong's cultural tradition. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Professor Amanda Whitford.

122
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:46,770
象牙貿易和殘酷的射殺動物、物種滅絕、刺激非法，呃犯罪行為是畫上等號的。請象牙商不要繼續躲在傳統的文化背後，將這個營謀私利的雪牙貿易和傳統文化化為一談。

123
00:13:43,620 --> 00:14:03,630
咁另外咧，嗰個嘅誒誒呢個法例咧，係話有五年嘅寬限期咧，我哋係覺得係足夠嚇，即係可以畀呢個業界轉型。咁當然咧，其中一個好大嘅關注點咧，就係會唔會係令到一啲嘅私有嘅財產係變咗係冇一個價值。

124
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:23,840
誒，我哋亦都注意到咧，就漁農自然管理處喺七月七號喺今年七月七號咧喺個法案委員會裏邊咧提出有關呢個私人產權同埋賠償嘅一啲回應嘅啊。咁誒，我哋作為唔係誒法律界人士咧，就唔誒唔畀唔可以畀誒好多意見啊。

125
00:14:40,850 --> 00:15:00,860
主席及委員會議員，大家好，我叫何燕青，代表美國最大的動物保護組織國際人道對待動物協會和全球上千萬的支持者，在這裏首先對立法會、香港政府支持禁止象牙貿易的努力表達由衷的感謝。香港是亞洲的國際都會，但

126
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:20,870
但是今年來近年來，卻因為血腥象牙貿易而蒙上恥辱。我們在這裡呼籲立法會，堅決反對就象牙商作出補償。自1990年國際象牙貿易禁止生效之後，香港象牙商已經有二十七年措措有餘的時間，販賣他們的象牙庫存。這

127
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:40,880
其中還包括大量的飛訪下洋流通，如今政府又再給予他們五年的時間。如果政府作出賠償，第一將對香港眾，呃七百多萬的納税人不公平；第二，許多商家曾參與象牙走私，作出補償等同是獎勵非法的行為。

128
00:15:40,880 --> 00:16:00,890
第三，全球都無這個補償象牙商的先例。美國政府曾經做出多項的法律裁決，他們認為説禁止象牙或是其他象及其他的這個野生動物，呃呃，貿易並不表示損害個人財產權。香港不應該開創惡例。

129
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,630
second only to seizures in dangerous drugs.

130
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,920
是必要，來應對一個非常真實和即將來臨的威脅。

131
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,550
attracting the full range of coercive investigative powers currently used to combat unlawful drugs and money laundering.

132
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:38,460
Further traders have not been asked to surrender their ivory to the government. They may continue. Thank you, Professor. But what next? We have Marco Shalabi, please, Marco.

133
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:30,230
我有 been lucky to see elephants living in Africa, not wild ones, but ones that were rescued and lived on a game reserve with other wild animals, such as rhinos and hippos.

134
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:34,570
as numerous other jurisdictions have already concluded, only a total ban on the sale of ivory will begin to undo the decades of harm caused by lack of effective legal protection for the African elephant.

135
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:23,040
post-convention ivory in Shangwan demonstrates that allowing any Hong Kong trade encourages poaching, smuggling and permits unscrupulous traders to sell illegally sourced ivory in defiance of treaties and local laws.

136
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:37,800
If the continued rise of this lucrative black market is to be curbed in the region, the need to raise the maximum penalties for possession and trade in endangered species must be addressed, along with the higher penalties proposed by the government. Wildlife crimes must be recognised in our legislation and in our courts as what they truly are: organised and serious crime.

137
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah, yeah, it's working. Chairperson and members, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address you today. I'm a law professor in the Department of Professional Legal Education at Hong Kong U, specialising in animal related crimes. I wish to express my gratitude to the Hong Kong government for formulating this important and urgent proposal to end the local trade in ivory and amend the penalty.

138
00:17:50,460 --> 00:18:10,470
for wildlife crimes, Hong Kong has played a significant role in bringing African elephant populations to their lowest numbers in history. The blind eye which has been turned to the continuing ivory trade in Hong Kong has facilitated the import into China of as much as seventy of the global illegal ivory trade. The recent prosecution of ivory traders for selling

139
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:54,860
in regard to smuggling, enforcement statistics demonstrate that illegal shipments of ivory to Hong Kong have been increasing over the past five years, especially by sea. Despite enhanced surveillance and more frequent seizures by Hong Kong's law enforcement authorities, criminal organisations funding the poaching and smuggling of ivory to Hong Kong remain undeterred, and this is hardly.

140
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:14,870
surprising given the paltry sentences handed down for convictions for wildlife crime. This year, the penalties imposed for smuggling ivory have ranged from a fine of two thousand dollars to a sentence of three months imprisonment. Such sentences are hardly deterrent given the substantial profits to be made in Hong Kong, and the average value of seizures in endangered species is now.

141
00:19:44,830 --> 00:20:04,840
最後ly，我 wish to turn to the subject of compensation。The right to private property under Article 6 and 105 of the Basic Law is not absolute. The government is permitted to take reasonable and rational action to restrict citizens' free use of their property, including its sale, where the restrictions are justified and in the public interest.

142
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,270
我 still。

143
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,780
recall。

144
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,850
這是我的 wife。

145
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,930
我係嚟代表我嘅家庭。

146
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,130
This is still pain in my heart.

147
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,400
Thank you, Margot. Next we have Mr. Chris Lidzimo from Save the Elephants.

148
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,530
我係，嚟代表我哋 fallen rangers， who were killed by poachers.

149
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:38,060
The death of my very closest friend Joseph, who was shot dead while on the line of duty in June this year.

150
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:39,070
my name is Chris Leardismo, the head of wildlife security at SAFE the Elephants in northern Kenya. I am from a people called the Samburu.

151
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:50,080
for generations, the Samburu have loved and respect the elephant that we live among. This is why it's natural for me to give my life defending them.

152
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:56,190
我係也嚟代表個社區，我哋嚟自，佢哋從頭代保護，佢哋保護個遺產免受破壞，免受損害對佢哋嘅生計。

153
00:22:50,410 --> 00:23:02,650
我工作在艱苦條件下，作為野生保育員，象牙那條線帶給我們更多罪犯比以往更多，伏擊者在等待伏擊者在每一個轉彎。

154
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:24,830
It would be a great shame if we can only see them preserved in zoos. Do we really want to see the biggest land mammal die out in the wild? Please help our planet. Ban the ivory trade and properly protect endangered species. Thank you.

155
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:18,790
驕傲者，sometimes say that they fear their livelihoods will be affected by the closure of the ivory market. But for us, it is our lives, not our livelihoods, that are at risk from the criminals that kill to supply ivory for sale.

156
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:24,930
在這 case，政府 makes 一個極度強烈的聲稱，即係持續的象牙貿易喺香港，妥協咗合法嘅社會利益，喺終止一個唔可以道德或者永續來

157
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:59,470
香港 needs to ban ivory trade because it is killing elephants. Poachers shoot the adult elephants for their tusks. The elephants then die a horrible death. After which the poachers hack at their faces to remove the tusks. Herds are destroyed. Young elephants are left without families, alone without their mothers.

158
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:19,480
Baby elephants are left to starve. Ivory is smuggled out of Africa and into Asia. Some arrives illegally in Hong Kong. Ivory may be smuggled into China and some is illegally sold by ivory traders in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, with its legal ivory trade, encourages the continued killing of elephants.

159
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:50,620
even on the reserve, hundreds of miles from where wild elephants and rhinos lived, the rangers were scared the poachers might come at night and take and kill the animals, just to get their tusks or horns to make money. We in Hong Kong need to do something more to protect the wild animals in Africa and other countries, banning the ivory trade.

160
00:21:50,620 --> 00:22:10,630
Hong Kong will help protect the animals, elephants. Improving the laws and punishing people properly will help to protect more endangered species. It makes me sad to see how beautiful elephants suffer just to satisfy satisfy man's needless desire. I hope that we can save the elephants in the wild and protect other species.

161
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,630
who have no voice。

162
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,670
這是香格里拉。

163
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,740
我 know， it it hurts。

164
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,400
the day he died，我係一隻一，who uncovered him。

165
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,360
我 strongly support the proposed ivory ban.

166
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,870
lose more comrades or even my life as a wildlife ranger.

167
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:18,150
我們有國際承諾，在制止下降和幫助受影響國家做到這一點。

168
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:48,600
whom I knew well, he was young man with small tusks, but he was still killed for his ivory.

169
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:33,850
eventually we will all victims of poachers, or one way or other, and I'm here to represent elephants.

170
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,900
I know, it breaks her heart. But still, because I know, no one keeps the peace in our landscape.

171
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:12,090
Unfortunately, laundering and illegal trade in ivory appear to be common into and through our city, and we cannot at the moment control this.

172
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:03,240
decisive action has already been taken by major ivory trading countries and is particularly important in Hong Kong because of our massive role in this trade.

173
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:14,930
我 leave，我 leave 她和我 three 子女， for long periods， not knowing when will will I return， nor if I will return。

174
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:49,220
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm a professor of biology and I work on sustainable use and trade in animals. I've been 24 years in Hong Kong.

175
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:13,730
like him, one hundred thousand were killed for the ivory between the year 2010 and 2012, and we are still in the battle. I know many traders may still may still say this killing is nothing to do with us, but as long as they are compensated, more elephants will die to fuel this trade, and I will.

176
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:38,180
我 understand that people in Hong Kong are not the ones who are buying ivory. The buyers are from outside. Yet, one, everyone else in the world thinks that it's you. I'm here to show you that we in Kenya are doing all we can. Oh, thank you, Mr. Ladismu. Next we have Dr. Evans Adovi. Dr. Adovi, please.

177
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,760
individual countries can't do this alone.

178
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,780
所以，我們cannot and should not let it happen again.

179
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,540
ivory is valuable is valuable but it is not

180
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,200
好，唔該曬嚇。下一位係沈素珊女士，唔該。

181
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,470
三個月之前嘅今日，六月六號，我參加咗上一次嘅公聽會。

182
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:51,000
淘汰象牙貿易不設補償，加重刑罰。主席，各位議員，政府官員，早晨。

183
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,390
Cannot get income, and who will compensate young people who will never see elephants?

184
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,070
Times have changed, and young people today want to preserve our planet's natural heritage and see animals alive.

185
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,790
The world has changed and we must change with it. Hong Kong is good at change and adapts very well, so why not the ivory trade?

186
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:59,310
Like gold, to which I've heard it compared to in this debate, ivory comes from living, disappearing animals. The extinction clock of African elephants is ticking. We know that time ran out completely for the elephants that once roamed much of China.

187
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:52,080
我強烈支持增加罰則 for wildlife crime。sadly, much wildlife crime today is associated with organised and serious crime that must be stopped, and our penalties must reflect the misery and cruelty associated with illegal trade in animals.

188
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:39,440
五 years to start the ban, however, is much too long given the alarming rates of poaching and illegal trade occurring. In five years' time, a further half of much reduced African elephants will be gone. The ban should start by the end of this year, and there is little to be gained. Waiting five more years, too much is to be lost.

189
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:14,210
誒當中唔夠三個月咧，就發生咗兩件好重要嘅事啦。第一件，七月六號，香港破獲咗三十年以嚟最大嘅象牙走私案，海關查獲咗七點二噸非法象牙，查獲嘅象牙當中不乏細小象牙，證明青年象甚至係小象都慘遭毒手。

190
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:23,080
一些反對禁貿易的人認為象牙是文化上重要。如果正確，那麼那些在乎這傳統的人，應該是那些努力確保大象有未來的人。但這並沒有發生。相反，象牙貿易似乎主要是關於高利潤，實際上，很少關於文化。

191
00:27:53,380 --> 00:28:13,390
finally, I strongly oppose compensation. Traders have known for almost three decades of the increasing risks of trading ivory. Government has sent clear messages over many years from the burning of tons of ivory to long engagement with traders. Elephants have long been declining and many ivory traders have refocused their trade. So those traders who have continued.

192
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:33,490
have taken a calculated risk, hoping to gain increased prices from declining ivory. Declining ivory. What is the justification to reward such behaviour with compensation using taxpayers' money? Who will compensate the families of a thousand plus rangers killed during the poaching? Who will compensate people in future who?

193
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,290
大量走私象牙嚟香港。

194
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,030
延續佢嘅精神，打擊野生動物罪行。

195
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,100
因為一件冷冰冰嘅裝飾品。

196
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,770
如果真係講賠償嘅話咧，依啲偉大嘅護林員。

197
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:07,200
致力保育新界鄉村嘅傳統文化，亦都係我嘅使命。

198
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,820
就風調雨順、國泰民安係我哋鄉村人傳統嘅許願嘅祈福語。

199
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:23,060
呢單走私案係咪意味住一啲機會主義者想藉住香港討論象牙貿禁貿嘅時間，喺實行禁令之前？

200
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:11,020
更加差嘅影響，有使收購同埋儲儲存非法象牙，以便得到更加多嘅賠償。提供賠償只係會助長大肆殺戮。

201
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:20,280
搞到悲劇年年發生，大家苦心自問啦。依家仲坐喺呢一度同政府講要公堂接濟，呢啲係人性嘅恥辱、良知嘅泯滅。

202
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:47,800
喺呢度，我亦都想向誒各位動物保育員啦、護林員同埋調查員致敬。佢哋偉大嘅精神，佢哋視其他物種嘅性命比自己更重要。呢一樣嘢，我覺得係應該值得高度讚揚嘅。

203
00:30:52,050 --> 00:31:06,030
佢哋經常被好殘暴咁謀殺，令到屋企人冇咗經濟支柱，冇咗最親嘅人。呢啲偉大嘅護林員，佢哋嘅遺孀、遺孤、孤兒寡婦，先至應該得到賠償，亦都係佢哋唯一一個人應該得賠償。

204
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:55,690
行動停止，多謝各位。好，唔該曬。下一位係林村許願廣場主席林陸榮先生。誒，早晨，主席各位。噉我係誒退休校長，亦都係依家係林村許願廣場嘅主席。

205
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:40,990
奢望政府能夠發放補償賺一筆最大嘅錢咧？如果係真嘅話，香港政府就萬萬不能墜入犯罪組織嘅陷阱，為象牙貿易提供任何補償。相反，政府應該係加重刑罰，懲治罪犯。

206
00:29:41,320 --> 00:30:01,330
象牙貿易禁令喺其他嘅地方亦都成成功實施，亦都冇向象牙商人提供任何補償。中國中央政府禁止象牙加工及銷售嘅時候，亦都唔向象牙商人提供任何補償。冇一個國家向象牙商人提提出補償，提出賠償，只會為非法象牙洗白產生。

207
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:31,410
第二件重要嘅事係野生動物保育員Willot先生喺多次受到死亡威脅之後，喺八月十六號被謀殺。誒，我喺度咧祝福佢屋企人一切安好。Willot先生浩氣長存，佢嘅死絕對唔會令任何動物保育保育員氣餒嘅。相反，所有動物保育員只會更加齊心，更加積極。

208
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:41,300
大象雖然唔識得講人話，但係no voice唔代表係no choice嘅。我哋唔應該淨係睇到好龐大嘅死傷數字，我哋應該用心去感受下。其實每一個受害人，每隻受害嘅象，佢哋係經歷緊好痛苦、好痛苦，先至會斷氣嘅。所以保育大象嘅朋友，我哋係不斷每為佢發聲，直至到一切屠殺。

209
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,870
喺非洲。

210
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,220
盜獵者因為象牙而被殘殺。

211
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,310
而保育傳統文化對每個社會都係非常之重要嘅。

212
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,840
選用其他物料，放棄使用象牙雕花藝術，依然可以保留。

213
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:09,130
失去咗大象，亦都令非洲旅遊業咧係蒙受巨大損失，國家國家經濟受挫。

214
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,730
傳統係指歷史流傳落嚟嘅思想啊、道德啊、風俗、藝術同埋制度等等。

215
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,700
雕刻技術係優良嘅傳統文化，值得保留，但係絕對唔係運用喺象牙嘅上面。

216
00:33:51,010 --> 00:34:00,970
警務人員咧去到非洲做呢個護林員，成為被謀殺、被殺嘅目標咧，係呢個係實實在在嘅例子嚟嘅。

217
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:43,720
象牙貿易聲稱象牙雕刻藝術係為咗傳統文化，但係雕刻可以係木雕、石雕或者其他嘅物料。

218
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:23,560
非洲大象係有感情、有靈性嘅高智慧嘅動物。嗱，非法貿易咧，正正咧係將大象嘅族羣啊推向瀕臨絕種嘅邊緣。

219
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:11,370
象牙雕藝術品更唔能夠稱得上係中國嘅傳統文化或者係國粹，因為象牙根本就唔係嚟自中國，而係嚟自非洲嘅。

220
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:32,860
但係我哋要小心去分辨，傳統文化亦都係有優劣之分，唔可以盲目噉樣保留。只有優良嘅傳統文化咧，先至值得我哋係世代相傳嘅。

221
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:44,890
嗱，大象咧，影啊喺啊維持呢個生態系統上咧，亦都係擔一擔任咧係非常之重要角色嘅。屠殺大象，自然生態系統咧就會嚴重被破被破壞。

222
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:51,010
象牙而殘殺象羣，血流成河。同時咧，負責保護大自然野生動物嘅護林員咧，更加經常咧係被謀殺嘅目標。咁呢啲家庭咧留下孤兒寡婦。咁剛才咧，阿Chris同埋喺第一節嘅時候有位前。

223
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:30,290
非法象牙貿易嘅盈利咧，亦都成為大型罪犯嘅誒活動嘅經費，造成其他嘅人命損失、屠生靈屠炭。噉我哋鄉村人咧，成日都話許願祈求國泰民安，但喺非洲咧，就因為象牙貿易咧而變得國不國不泰、民不安。

224
00:34:46,290 --> 00:35:06,300
導致咧係誒樹林咧係減少啦。啊啊唔該，時間夠啦。下一位阿廖英南女士，廖女士，唔該。主席你好，各位官員你好。我喺YouTube嗰度睇到一條短片，草原上咧誒係誒嗰個故事係講嘅草原上嘅黃昏咧，夕陽。

225
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,740
眼淚不停噉樣流。

226
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,930
悲慘嘅哀曲。

227
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,740
生命咧危在旦夕。

228
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,710
睇完呢條短片，我真係心好痛。

229
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,640
我係兩位小朋友嘅媽媽。

230
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,780
彷徨無助，苦不堪言。

231
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,240
兩個小孩咧就變成兩隻象仔。

232
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,220
夕陽輝，夕夕陽如輝，紅霞片片。

233
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,470
一分鐘嘅短片，道出大象喺地球嘅。

234
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,280
能夠送畀仔女咧最好嘅禮物，就係一個健康嘅地球。

235
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:13,890
兩名將仔咧就守喺媽媽嘅將身旁，號哭不止，悲愴不絕。

236
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:06,830
象媽媽臉上咧一對象牙好清楚可以見到，象媽媽盡最後一口氣噉樣哀鳴一聲，重傷倒地。

237
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:12,330
豪沙大象充滿鮮血，大部分咧獵殺嘅大象均被活生生咁奪去奇象牙。睇過呢條記錄嘅短片。

238
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,460
係。

239
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,710
象仔變成孤兒。

240
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,390
但係被拯救嘅象仔去到孤兒院。

241
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,700
當中嘅痛楚，不能想象。

242
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,260
佢因媽媽奶水嗰時個樣非常幸福。

243
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,990
但大象咧，仲有生命氣息，痛苦哀哭。

244
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,220
我朋友個名叫Roy，佢有一隻好可愛嘅小象玩具。

245
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,380
一日之後，同一位遊客發現象媽媽瞓咗喺地下。

246
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,800
係咁不停流眼淚，不停係咁嗌，長仔保姆幫佢抹眼淚。

247
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,680
阿Roy喺我屋企好得寵嘅，爸爸媽媽、阿哥同埋我都好中意阿Roy。

248
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:12,920
主席，主席，各位議員，大家好，我係焦卓瑤，今年十歲。我今日帶咗位好朋友陪我嚟會議廳發言。

249
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:24,290
拯救人員啊，到場到到達災場，倒地地上嘅大象，象鼻被切斷，面骨爆裂，象牙被盜。

250
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:26,830
拯救隊發現阿Roy嘅媽媽中咗獵人嘅毒箭，大象家庭入面因為冇其他大象可以提供奶水，拯救隊冇辦法就只可以將阿Roy同埋大象家庭分離，將佢帶翻小象孤兒院。

251
00:37:45,490 --> 00:38:02,010
拯救大象刻不容緩，大象已經不能再等啦，否則我哋嘅後代就就只能在喺書本上或者電視上可以睇到。唔該曬，廖小姐。嗱，今日好多年輕嘅朋友，咁其中一位係阿焦卓堯，焦卓堯唔該你。

252
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:11,630
而阿roy似乎係明白不幸嘅事情發生咗，阿roy隻眼充滿淚水，彷徨嘅神情同身體語言都講緊我真係好傷心啊！成個大象家庭都好努力安慰阿roy，但係阿roy就係唔肯離開媽咪。

253
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:52,690
媽媽咧同嗰兩個小孩抱入懷中，子彈橫飛，媽媽從後中槍，兩名小孩咧目睹嘅一切，跟住嚎係咁嚎哭，慘絕人寰。媽媽倒地嗰一刻，畫面影像咧就變成一隻大象嘅身軀。

254
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:30,570
女主角咧當時係拖住兩名小孩喺草原上咧，拼命噉樣奔跑，手持重型嘅槍槍械，同埋啲暴徒咧係近在咫尺。佢哋三母子咧筋疲力盡，毫無反抗能力，停落嚟就係等死神臨近。

255
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:38,070
兩兩兩隻象仔跟象媽媽生離死別，象媽媽心如刀割，眼睛失去光彩，緩緩噉樣蓋上靈魂。跟住咧，夕陽一同直落西山。跟住影片最後一刻有一個問題就係What if this wasn't a movie？

256
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:44,970
點解我會為小象玩具起咗阿Roy呢個名咧？阿Roy其實係一隻真正生活喺非洲嘅小象孤兒。我由網絡電視見到阿Roy嘅故事。阿Roy原本係一隻活潑可愛、充滿好奇心嘅象仔，由遊客影到嘅影像見到，阿Roy係大象家庭入面嘅寶貝女。

257
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,920
爸爸去試翻一次先。

258
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,870
跟住就扶住架單車畀我練習。

259
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,770
喺我四歲嘅時候咧，我爸爸教我踩單車。

260
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:02,410
我同半句阿Roy講，希望喺小將孤兒院嘅阿Roy將來可以同佢嘅大將家庭重逢就好啦。

261
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:19,760
如果冇爸爸嘅指導，由得我自己學嘅話，應該都未學識，就因為跌親送咗入醫院啦。

262
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:40,350
好彩，Arad好快就適應到同其他大小象孤兒一齊健康咁生活。為咗呢段新聞，我幫小象玩具起咗呢個名，希望Arad有我做伴，以後就唔會再孤單。

263
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:54,690
幾個禮拜之前，媽咪帶我睇咗一套大象嘅紀錄片。等我明白阿威變成孤兒嘅真正原因。如果等我知道小象同人類一樣，都好需要長輩嘅教育，先可以健康成長。

264
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:34,140
小朋友真係唔可以一次就學識啦。我撞咗上石博好多次㗎，好在由爸爸耐心咁反覆教導，最後終於學識。我覺得自己好幸福，我亦都希望所有象仔都一樣咁幸福。

265
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:50,540
價值，任何人唔單止父母或者教師，在咗官員、議員或者商人啦，都有責任教育下一代愛惜自然、愛惜動物。我哋嘅國粹啊、文化、雕刻藝術，唔應該無止境噉樣建立喺唔能夠自救嘅貧人物種身上。

266
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:52,810
我知道北非白犀牛全世界就剩翻三隻，真係想象唔到我嘅一家三口小四口小家庭，竟然比全世界嘅北非白犀牛數量仲要多。我嘅願望就係大個咗之後親自到非洲探訪野生大象，同真嘅阿哥見下面。

267
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:13,210
各位議員，其實我今日要同學校請假，先可以出席公聽會嘅，同你哋分享我嘅願望，所以希望你哋唔好令我失望。多謝。好啊，唔該曬你啊，卓瑤。誒，下一位葉常青女士，葉女士係主席。各位議員、啊官員，大家好，我係個誒兩個。

268
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:33,220
仔誒仔嘅媽媽同埋一個中學教師，我認為咧，香港人嘅焦點咧唔應該由於本地，唔應該由於個人嘅資衣食住行，而係應該將眼界放遠，注重下一代嘅正確價值觀。喺我嚟睇咧，畀細路仔最寶貴唔只係應該係培養佢哋能夠參加American Got Talent嘅才能啦，唔。

269
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:53,230
唔止係替佢哋排隊報考，例如啊啊Imperial College嘅名校啦，呢啲噉樣，而係話畀佢哋聽咧，邊啲係更有價值，邊啲係更啱嘅。呢個係我坐喺呢度發現嘅原因。當然，當有人話畀我聽啦，取替象牙貿易啊，唔使賠誒不予補補償，加重誒非法貿易象牙罰則咧，係損害中國。

270
00:41:53,230 --> 00:42:13,240
國誒國水嘅時候，我實在懷疑啊！今時今日呢個國水咧，價值究竟有幾多？呢個不外乎係少數有錢人、較為有錢人嘅嗜好同埋玩意係唔係話冇價值嘅？但係不過係一啲身外物，能夠與愛惜自然呢個重要嘅價值相比咩？我哋點可以為咗自己嘅？

271
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:33,250
嗜好或者係文化而變得咁自私，罔顧其他人嘅其他人其他物種嘅生命咧。因此我提出第一點啦，珍惜係一個好重要嘅價值嘅。我哋嘅嗜好可以無限，我哋嘅快樂咧可以可以從多種嘅途徑獲得。我哋可以睇書、做運動、飼養寵物、愛惜係我哋灌輸畀後代嘅重要。

272
00:42:50,820 --> 00:43:10,830
第二誠實係一個重要嘅價值。當有唔少確實嘅證據擺喺眼前咧，證明大量非法入口象牙咧如木混珠噉樣替補舊象牙，以致賣咗廿七年啊嘅舊貨都買之不去，貨如輪轉，證明咧象牙商全心欺騙，仲口硬無齒同誒政府甚窮，要求。

273
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,300
我們知道呢。

274
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,700
我們知道，因為

275
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,390
那係等於一半的人口在九個月內消失。

276
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:47,760
coincident with these population declines, hundreds of tons of elephant ivory has been shipped from Africa to Asia.

277
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:10,170
貿易，我哋係大量殘殺象大象嘅幫兇，係射殺護林員、害人哋家破人亡嘅槍手，係資助非洲。

278
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:19,250
啊，唔好意思啦，夠鐘啦，陳小姐。下位咧，我哋請Professor David Dunger from the University of Hong Kong，Professor Dunger，please。Thank，thank you。

279
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:43,150
最 recent science demonstrates that ongoing poaching of African elephants far exceeds their population growth rates. If continued, it will cause their extinction.

280
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:21,010
賠償，企圖臨走嗰時候咧都攬一筆。我哋我哋如果唔發聲嘅話咧，請問我哋點樣教我哋嘅細路仔同埋學生咧誠實呢個重要嘅價值咧？

281
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:39,030
Clearly, such losses are unsustainable, and they'll result in the disappearance of the African elephant in your lifetime, and most certainly in the lifetimes of the children who are in this chamber with us today.

282
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:32,620
主席、成員及政府官員，我的名字是David Dudgeon。我係Chair Professor of Ecology and Biodiversity at the University of Hong Kong，and I'm speaking today on behalf of our conservation forensics laboratory.

283
00:45:48,300 --> 00:46:02,130
我們知道那，因為遺傳學測試，的象牙貨物，截獲過過去20年，確認所有象牙來自非洲象，那係從一篇發表在《科學》雜誌，的最新研究。

284
00:44:45,580 --> 00:45:02,190
因為一 recent study in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. reported that between 2010 and 2012, 100,000 African elephants were killed, 40,000 in 2011 alone. That's more than 100 a day.

285
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:20,450
另一個研究顯示，森林象在非洲，正逐漸減少，人口在2002年至2011年間減少62%。第三個研究顯示，草原象在非洲的數量，正逐漸減少，每年減少8%。

286
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:41,350
第三，七忍之心係重要嘅價值，亦係幾千年我哋中國人嘅國粹。邊啲文化可以比呢一樣嘢更重要啊？當有唔少證據證明咧，非法偷運象牙，直接或者間接咧，導致大量嘅貧危象牙咧，誒貧危大象痛苦死亡，護林員被槍殺，好多家庭破碎頓失依靠。

287
00:43:41,420 --> 00:44:01,430
呢啲正係滴緊血嘅象牙咧，大部分咧都嚟咗香港，經入去去轉運其他國家，近在咫尺，同我哋係咪真係無關咧？難道中國人講嘅惻隱之心咧，唔應該畀一啲非洲人咩？佢哋都係人啊嘛！如果我哋唔遏止呢啲事情咧，就等於咧放行非法象牙。

288
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:22,430
放射碳 dating of some of those shipments shows that 90% of the ivory seized after 2002 was derived from elephants killed recently after the 89 ban in trade. Hong Kong plays a major role in the trade of elephant ivory from Africa.

289
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,060
五個被 seize in Hong Kong。

290
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,130
It seems strange that in twenty-seven years, these traders cannot clear their stock.

291
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,390
another point these traders make is that ivory carving is an ancient Chinese art and tradition.

292
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,910
ivory is an outdated trade and tradition, which belongs in the past and has no place here in 2017.

293
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:03,480
他的工作有幫助，無限地阻止偷獵，和就像許多其他人，他死， died 保護非洲野生動物。

294
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:11,640
Thousands of people and hundreds of thousands of elephants have been killed, all for material which is not essential to the survival of human beings.

295
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:40,360
although traders claim all their stock is legal, many have been documenting, revealing to customers that they buy blood ivory and pass it off as legal.

296
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:39,510
and the forensics showed that they contained tusks from animals killed after the 1989 ban in international trade in ivory.

297
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:13,120
我 believe Hong Kong is making the right steps in this bill, and I hope that with it comes changes that will bring about a better world and an end to the ivory trade.

298
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:38,490
today，and it deeply saddens me to know that Hong Kong，the place I've spent my entire life living，is contributing to the mass slaughtering of this wonderful and unique animal.

299
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:56,150
The truth is， ivory is no magic material that allows for beautiful carving. Carving that is done with ivory can easily be done with wood and special plastics.

300
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:51,360
最近，AFCD帶來了一場成功的控罪，關於非法販賣象牙，發生在商貿灣，而法醫學證據顯示，再次證明這些大象是在1989年禁令後被殺的。

301
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:26,120
since the total ban of all sales of ivory obtained before the year 1990, Hong Kong traders have stockpiled 700 tons of ivory. Now, 27 years later, Hong Kong traders still have over 70 tons of ivory left.

302
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:55,390
ivory is not only about the bloody and brutal slaughter of elephants, wildlife conservationists and park rangers are also losing their lives fighting this cause, as many have already mentioned. Just recently, Wayne Lottar, the founder of Pam's Foundation, was shot and killed in Tanzania.

303
00:46:51,870 --> 00:47:08,750
所以，Clearly，there's indisputable scientific evidence that ivory from recently killed African elephants is traded on the streets of Hong Kong. The science clearly indicates the future of elephants in Africa will depend substantially on far-sighted action by the Hong Kong SAR government.

304
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,580
係。

305
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,730
だから。

306
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,550
已經係多過足夠時間。

307
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:49,150
他們有更長的時間來清走他們的庫存，比我活着的時間還長。

308
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,010
他們有27年嚟清佢哋嘅股，如果呢個法案通過，佢哋會再有五年。

309
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:00,300
由我細細個接受教育開始，就學識要愛護大自然，同埋珍惜所有嘅生物。

310
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:45,040
since 1990， six Olympic Games have been played， five U.S. presidents have been in office。

311
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:13,560
Please do not delay the implementation of the ban. Thank you. Thank you。好啊，好，收到，收到，收到，收到，唔該。

312
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:07,650
點解而家咁文明嘅社會仲會容許將大象推去瀕臨絕種邊緣嘅商業活動繼續進行？

313
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:20,610
我 also believe that no compensation should be given to ivory traders, and there should be an increase in wildlife crime punishments.

314
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:31,530
traders have been being caught selling blood ivory, and should not be rewarded with compensation or given a light sentence for engaging in illegal activity.

315
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:18,260
只要象牙貿易一日存在，我哋任何人都唔可以置身事外，包括香港。因此，我全力支持政府立法禁止象牙貿易。

316
00:49:52,350 --> 00:50:06,370
Mahatma Gandhi once said, "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated." I hope that the, I hold that the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to protection by man from the cruelty of man.

317
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:32,910
經過咁多年嘅調調查，象牙商人一直以一呢啲合法象牙為名嚟進行一啲跨國非法嘅象牙貿易。如果象牙商業活動繼續喺香港進行，噉就真係代表住我哋香港正正喺度支持緊呢一種咁可惡嘅非法行為。

318
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:37,760
而更悲哀嘅係，香港象牙商人而家要求政府作出賠賠償，我喺呢度極力反對。任何賠償就代表住象牙依然係一項賺錢嘅工具。只要有收入，佢哋就會大開殺戒，目的就係為咗賺取呢啲不義之財。

319
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:29,040
We therefore urge the Hong Kong government to end all commercial trade of elephant ivory with immediate effect. Thank you very much. Thank you. The next speaker will be Mr. Pierre Duffy. Mr. Duffy, please. Legislative councillors and representatives of the government: elephants are one of the most iconic animals alive.

320
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:53,240
調查亦都證實咗象牙貿易係會助長跨國犯罪集團嘅增加，幫助支付恐怖襲擊同埋購買軍火嘅經費。呢一啲罪惡嘅增加，其實都令到我哋人類嘅安全係難以得到保障。咁點解我哋仲要支持其他人？你作出一啲危害到我哋自身安全嘅行為咧？

321
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,940
長。

322
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,560
我哋長大之後要自力更生，利用自己嘅能力嚟回饋社會。

323
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:35,810
利用呢一種不當嘅手法嚟賺錢，試問我哋要點樣教到下一代啊？

324
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:27,540
噉啊！屠殺大將，亦都令到好多野生嘅動物失去家園，生態亦都被逼走上呢個滅亡之路。

325
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:47,070
噉啊，大笨象啦，係陸地上最體型最龐大嘅動物啦。噉啊，如果健康嘅話咧，其實其實佢哋有七十歲命嘅。

326
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:20,950
喺呢度，我懇請咁多位議員為我哋嘅下一代著想。好，唔該曬啊！啊，下一位係香港賽車學校嘅冼浩明先生，唔該你。

327
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:11,350
最後，我希望政府大幅度加強野生動植物罪行嘅刑罰，因為噉樣先可以提高咗嚇性，直接減少殘忍嘅行為。

328
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:19,180
大笨象喺生物學上面咧係一個好關鍵嘅物種嚟嘅，佢哋去保護環境，維持一個草原嘅生態，咁令到其他嘅生物啦，亦都有一個棲息嘅地方。

329
00:54:47,960 --> 00:55:01,020
有人藉住呢個香港嘅法律嘅漏洞，從事一啲非法嘅象牙貿易，所以其實一班商人要求政府啊，為咗帶有呢個非法嘅成分嘅商業活動作出補償，係好唔合理嘅。

330
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:12,860
或者海關破壞販賣人口或者偷運毒品嘅罪行，咁唔通香港政府都就係因為要救出呢啲販賣嘅人口或者充公被偷運嘅毒品而作出賠償？呢樣係冇可能嘅。

331
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:30,010
要知道奪取象牙係一件好殘暴、唔人道嘅行為。象媽媽佢哋死得好痛苦，小象目擊住失去至親，就算佢哋好慶幸噉樣生存到，其實佢哋亦都受到好重大嘅打擊。

332
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:37,700
係主席、議員咁多位官員，早晨。我係香港賽車學校嘅創辦人冼浩明。噉啊，呢排咧香港咧，其實誒社會有相當多嘅關於象牙嘅貿易嘅討論啦。噉我係非常之關注咧非洲大象現時嘅情況嘅。

333
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:58,460
過往嘅調查同埋舊年嘅一對象牙筷子，其實已經證實咗香港存在緊非法象牙嘅售賣。倘若香港香港政府作出賠償，即係代表香港政府支持違法行為，其實就正如我哋唔會支持販賣人口或者偷運毒品一樣。若然香港嘅警察

334
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:56,100
象牙商人話希望佢哋嘅後代可以繼承前人剩低落嚟嘅象牙。我作為年輕年輕嘅學生，我先唔希望可以繼承呢一種血淋淋嘅事業。相反，我認為我哋年輕嘅新一代應該不靠福音，不求政府接濟，或者坐收政府嘅賠償。

335
00:53:47,350 --> 00:54:07,360
噉佢哋亦都非常之聰明啦，亦都好善於交際，擁有好豐富嘅深層情緒。其實大笨象同我哋人類都好相似嘅。噉佢哋喺維持生態嘅系統咧，擔當一個好重要嘅角色嘅。佢哋嘅糞便亦都可以作為一啲植物嘅養分，佢哋嘅移動亦都可以幫助植物嘅傳播生。

336
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,190
所以大象同埋人類係極之相似嘅。

337
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,110
識得哀傷同埋悼念死去嘅同類，等等。

338
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,080
佢哋亦都擁有長遠嘅記憶，同埋豐富嘅感情。

339
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:17,860
喺年長嘅大將領導之下，小將去學習生存嘅技能。

340
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:48,380
相信你同埋我都唔會容許同樣嘅事情發生喺人類嘅身上面。

341
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:49,090
噉我喺睇紀錄片度得知，因為象牙貿易嘅活動，令到大象不斷不斷噉樣被殺。

342
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:11,820
但仲係非常聰明同埋善於交際嘅動物，同人類一樣都中意羣體生活同埋合作。

343
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:56,480
如果今日我哋唔停止象牙貿易，好快非洲嘅大象就會喺地球上面消失。

344
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:04,440
噉樣嘅話，我哋將來就淨係可以喺書本上面嘅圖片，或者係電視上面先可以見到大象啦。

345
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:42,000
當偷獵者去殺害大象嘅時候，大象嘅同伴或者子女，無論心理或者生理，都係要承受極大極大嘅打擊。

346
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:14,470
咁至於點解我會關注到象牙嘅問題咧？其實因為我有幾位嘅對大象保育嘅相當關注嘅學員啦，噉佢哋都有講開誒一啲大笨象嘅問題。

347
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:27,870
修法不賠賠償，堵留呢個法律嘅漏洞，希望擺脱呢個污名。多謝咁多位。好，唔該曬。咁跟住我哋有幾位好年輕嘅朋友啦。咁第一位係阿林浩，林浩，林浩唔該你啊。

348
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:41,800
主席，各位議員，早晨。我係林浩，今年十一歲，啱啱升上中一。我認為禁止象牙貿易係刻不容緩嘅，因為大象嘅數目已經下降去要面臨絕種嘅邊緣。

349
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:54,070
嘅噉係，所以係唔應該獲得賠償。我哋賽車亦都講求公平公正，但係一啲商人亦都帶有啲非法嘅成分，係唔公平唔公正，應該要嚴加處理嘅。我哋亦都應該要識得學識去守規矩。咁所以，我哋希望就係。

350
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:47,960
噉啊，象牙嘅貿易喺非洲大象嘅急劇嘅數量下跌，亦都係一個主要嘅原因。香港亦都係被公認為全球最大嘅象牙貿易中心。咁呢個係嚴重破壞咗香港作為國際都市嘅形象嘅。咁亦都好多次曾經被揭發，亦都。

351
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:34,880
噉我自己創辦賽車學校嘅其中一個原因咧，其實係希望社會對賽車嘅運動嘅誤解係一有一個深層次嘅認識嘅。咁事實上，賽車運動員講求一個紀律、自律，但係象人嘅傷誒，但係象牙嘅商人咧，其實佢哋唔講求紀律，唔講求自。

352
00:55:54,350 --> 00:56:14,360
政府應該要嚇強力去立法去支持呢個啊動物嘅罪行嘅刑罰嘅噉啊，嚴懲一啲野生動物嘅罪犯。我亦都全力支持香港政府盡快聯同其他嘅國家合力終止象牙嘅貿易同埋打擊非法象牙嘅活動，送出收。

353
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,330
另外。

354
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,550
生命係一去不返嘅。

355
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,710
而令到大象過住更悲慘嘅生活。

356
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,180
相比世界其他地方，係過輕嘅。

357
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,380
而家香港野生動植物罪行嘅刑罰？

358
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,350
我嘅志願係成為一位劍擊運動員。

359
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,360
咁香港政府就需要即刻禁止象牙貿易。

360
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,550
亦都係因為噉樣而起唔到任何嘅阻嚇作用。

361
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,100
還無數慘死嘅大將同埋護林員一個公道。

362
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:59,810
原則同埋精神去懲治野生動植物嘅罪犯。

363
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:11,240
亦都令倖存嘅象羣同埋護林員嘅家人得到安慰。

364
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,710
因為拯救物種嘅生命比任何事都更加重要同埋急切。

365
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,940
除咗比賽之外，作為運動員最重要嘅一項任務同埋使命。

366
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,950
既然大將嘅存亡同張牙貿易嘅活動有住唔可以分割嘅必然關係。

367
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:56,120
所以人類更加冇理由，亦都唔應該任意去獵殺大象，去滿足人類嘅貪婪。

368
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:53,900
就係要喺社會上邊提倡同埋宣揚公平、公正嘅處事態度。

369
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,740
象牙貿易。

370
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,720
我今日見你，how are you？

371
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,680
elephants left in the world now.

372
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,270
因為佢哋嘅工作實在太危險啦。

373
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:18,590
Thank you, Haley. Next we have Sophia Hassan, Sophia.

374
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,170
好，唔該曬。嗯，下一位係Healy Chan，Healy唔該你。Thank you。

375
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:18,640
最後，我希望喺呢度向勇敢嘅護林員同埋調查員講一聲多謝。

376
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:53,950
我亦反對補償被付給 ivory貿易者，因為這可能鼓勵更多走私交易發生，並讓人民可以合法地提出他們的陳述。

377
01:00:49,480 --> 01:01:03,290
So there was a debate that antique ivory trade should be legal. People can easily say that ivory they have is antique, whether or not. That created a loophole for illegal ivory trade to happen. So I really feel that ivory trade has to be completely banned.

378
00:59:52,960 --> 01:00:08,800
30% of African elephants have disappeared in the past seven years. If my calculations are correct, all the African elephants will be gone if human keeps on poaching elephants within 20 years. That means elephants will history in our next generations.

379
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:50,600
Dear Chairman and Council Members, I strongly feel that Hong Kong should completely ban ivory trade. Firstly, I want to share with all of you some statistics about elephants. Fifteen to twenty thousand elephants are killed due to poaching every year. There are only approximately four hundred and fifteen thousand African.

380
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:29,090
大象係一隻非常 intelligent 及 human friendly 動物，which has over fifty five million years of history in our planet. They have been highly respected by lots of people in many countries, and we must protect them. Secondly, I'm going to talk about ivory trade. Ivory has no actual use for any household purposes apart from decorations.

381
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:49,480
ivory is mainly for merchants to make money from trading. Most ivory came from African elephants. Poachers from countries like Congo trade elephant tusks to finance war and terrorist activities. In other words, if we can't stop ivory trading from happening, we can't stop war and terrorism in these countries. Although

382
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:23,700
Lastly, I want to tell all of you, enforcement of law to stop ivory trade is very important. Our regulation is insufficient to stop smugglers from importing ivory to Hong Kong at the moment. The penalty is not heavy enough to stop illegal ivory import and trade in Hong Kong. I encourage you to consider increasing fine and imprisonment of illegal.

383
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:45,210
There are almost fifty to a hundred elephants dying every day. Banning ivory trade now is crucial. I disagree the suggestion to totally ban ivory trade in three phases till 2021. This will just give poachers more time to kill more elephants and expedite elephants to extinct. Smugglers will be the only party taking most of the advantages.

384
01:01:54,510 --> 01:02:14,520
We must completely ban ivory trade in Hong Kong as soon as possible. China, which is the biggest market of ivory trade, is already ahead of us to completely ban ivory trade by the end of this year. We should consider following the same to show Hong Kong is not a laggard city in the legislation. Please action to save elephants. Thank you.

385
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,160
Thank you.

386
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,770
That's too long.

387
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,380
我九 years old. Okay, please go on.

388
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,410
Okay, thank you. Next we have Thomas Wu. Thomas, please.

389
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:03,890
Nova Hong Kong has a five-year plan to ban ivory trade by two thousand and twenty-one.

390
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,660
我 strongly don't support idea of giving money to the ivory traders.

391
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,380
Every year, twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand elephants are killed for their tusks.

392
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:46,470
我 think that this will encourage more and more people to protect or elephants.

393
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:19,730
The stocks have remained more or less the same, which can't be explained by the demand going down.

394
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:47,180
The only living creature that needs ivory are elephants. Elephants have turned into refugees of their own world.

395
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:35,260
In short, if we want a world of elephants, we need to speed up the ivory ban in Hong Kong.

396
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:13,290
Nevertheless， there are loopholes in implementation. Plan was what you have with what you sell， and there was no replacements.

397
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:27,710
香港有400個 licence，有40,000象牙物品 for sale，and it's more than any other city in the world.

398
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:33,790
the greed for ivory is threatening to extinguish elephants in our lifetime. In fact, in 2015, 20,000 African elephants were killed for their tusks.

399
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:58,440
forever more， elephants have feelings like us， so let switch it around。let say elephants were hunting us and wanted our fingers for jewelry。would you like that？

400
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:15,230
Dear Chairman and Council Members, I strongly believe that Hong Kong should ban ivory trade. Elephant population plummeted by about ninety percent in one century due to habitat destruction and massive poaching, according to statistics by WWF. Thirty-three thousand elephants die poaching.

401
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,320
please。

402
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:19,840
在手。

403
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,300
Thank you, Thomas. Next we have Ru Chao Ru.

404
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:41,080
what they say is the world's largest ever seizure of about 7.2 tons of ivory.

405
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,280
我會like to bring up that the items fashioned by ivory could be created perfectly well using any other material like alabaster and clay.

406
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:49,830
它 blesses you with social status， it imparts happiness and a sense of well-being。但 in fact， ivory doesn't bring this to someone。 in fact， it brings sorrow， death and pain。

407
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:39,360
但According to John Colvill of National Geographic， part of the reason ivory is still in existence is because we like to show off our rich artifacts crafted from ivory， and we believe that it is a wonderful gift to give。

408
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:13,680
inside its head，in order in order to get the whole tusk，the poachers either cut it out from a living elephant，it then dies slowly in agony，or they kill the elephant and cut the tusk out。

409
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:28,180
一羣一羣的象，正在走過一個泥潭，忙著自己的事情。突然，一羣獵人襲擊牠們，留下母象孤零零地死去，而小象則看著牠的象牙被割出頭骨。

410
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:35,240
Every year, poachers are not only threatening elephants, but also humans who are protecting elephants. Hong Kong is a major city of the world's ivory trade. It is not only a big market for ivory demand, but also a transit station for ivory trade. In July 2017, authorities in Hong Kong have

411
01:04:41,390 --> 01:05:01,400
tusks with an estimated street value of close to 172 million Hong Kong dollars. Elephants are beautiful and incredibly intelligent creatures. They're part of us as us human beings. Elephants have feelings too. They can be happy, sad, angry and frustrated. One third of an elephant's tusks

412
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:34,200
Imagine one day you're walking down the street doing nothing wrong. Someone pins you to the ground. You struggle, but it is useless. They pull out all of your teeth. Blood pours out from your mouth. How would you feel? If you give compensation to ivory traders to ban ivory trade, this is the opposite. For example, a child loves Pokemon cards. Both parents.

413
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:54,210
want him to stop playing Pokemon cards. His parents say, if you give me all of your Pokemon cards, I'll give you a lot of cash. Will that help? No. Ivory is used for jewelry and ornaments. It is replaceable. Please stop harming elephants out of human greed. Please ban ivory trade. Please don't give compensation to ivory traders. Thank you.

414
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:18,830
The elephant has been walking the earth for over fifty-five million years. Ivory trade can bring these innocent creatures down if humans continue progressing as we are. It is a common fact that the elephant population is shooting steeply downwards, and if we do not end the ivory trade in Hong Kong, the probability will be higher that the generation of elephants will end.

415
01:06:50,110 --> 01:07:10,120
To take away poachers' jobs, we shouldn't give compensation to them. Compensation will just trigger another wave of poachers, so that they themselves will earn a compensation. We have refused to give a compensation to any poachers, and we should keep it like this. Every hour, four elephants are killed. I'd like you to visualise elephants.

416
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:49,730
個。

417
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:32,040
謝謝。感謝你給我這個機會，來代表香港獸醫協會和中國香港獸醫協會。

418
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:23,480
香港嘅象牙貿易禁令係極其重要，請立即停止。我哋係請阿Jane Gary，Doctor Jane Gary，please。

419
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:22,750
將大象推向滅絕，更加為香港政策執行上增加負擔。另外，延長寬限期只會使象牙貿易商人推遲轉型。

420
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:14,390
合法同非法嘅象牙貿易嘅主要需求係嚟自香港、大陸同埋美國，所以全球都渴望香港喺呢個關鍵時刻向世界展現其領導同道德價值。

421
01:11:52,330 --> 01:12:09,280
000 elephants per year. This mass slaughter mainly occurs to satisfy the demand for ivory products in Asia, with Hong Kong playing a major role in this trade. We currently have the dubious distinction of being the city with the world's largest retail ivory market.

422
01:10:43,070 --> 01:11:00,560
關乎嘅不僅係貧危絕種被殺嘅大象，更加要背後有犯罪網絡。所以嚴厲執法嘅話，對社會嘅安全威脅；唔嚴厲執法嘅話咧，對社會嘅安全威脅係會繼續嘅。

423
01:07:51,100 --> 01:08:10,060
Ultimately，I stand with the government in their decision of not giving compensation to ivory traders and to end the poaching and deaths of countless elephants once and for all. Also，I'd like to thank my friends，Summer and Cynthia for making the poster for me. Thank you. Thank you，Roo。跟住下一位咧，係嗯保護國。

424
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:49,040
Isn't it obvious how barbaric this is? People killing you because you they forget that you're alive and can feel the pain of dying. Imagine this happening to you or your family, your child, um, left all alone in the world, with no one to take care of her, left left to starve to death. And this happens around four times every.

425
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:30,350
國際基金會嘅Christine Law，唔該，Christine。唔該，主席各位議員，本人代表Conservation International保護國際基金會，全力支持香港政府嘅立法建議，禁止香港象牙貿易，並加強對貧藝物種非法貿易同走私嘅處罰。

426
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:50,360
我哋主要有三項建議，使政策發揮最大嘅效力。第一，加快全面禁止象牙貿易喺修政案通過，盡快生效，以配合中國大陸二零一七年底前全面禁止象牙貿易嘅政策。否則，中國大陸嘅禁令將會使香港成為。

427
01:08:50,360 --> 01:09:10,370
大陸走私象牙嘅避風港，香港亦會因此蒙羞，因此而成為國際笑柄。現時實行全面象牙禁令，會有使犯罪集團、偷獵者同走私者喺二零二一年截止日期之前加快獵殺更多大象，噉樣不單止會。

428
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:43,040
第二，支持政府不提供經濟補償，向象牙貿易商提供非經濟嘅援助計劃。全球係冇任何國家向象牙商人提供經濟賠償嘅。香港如果開先例，咁存貨同新獵殺嘅大象象牙將會被偽裝成為合法存貨。

429
01:09:43,040 --> 01:10:03,050
湧現香港，要知道中國只係畀十二個月嘅時間清貨。如果香港使用納税人嘅錢去補貼呢啲象牙商人，係極度不明智嘅做法。如果對象牙商人提供經濟賠償，又有非法嘅象牙被虛報為合法交易，咁根本就係。

430
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:23,060
等於間接用納税人嘅錢去資助不道德嘅商人，去繼續殺害大象同埋大象保育人士，根本係唔公平同唔合理嘅。第三，支持政府通過並積極執行處罰，並建議至少十年監禁。政府建議增加刑罰。

431
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:43,070
是最高監禁十年，呢個係符合國際標準。如果定立較低嘅刑罰，就會犯罪犯就可能選擇香港成為首選嘅犯罪基地。中國大陸亦都正考慮對野生動物罪行實行無期徒刑。象牙貿易關。

432
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:52,330
兩個協會強烈支持擬議的《Cap 586》修正案，並堅信這些修正案將大幅改善不僅僅是大象的福利和保護，也包括非洲地面的人們。這是個悲劇，因為平均每小時有三到四頭大象在非洲被殺，相當於超過。

433
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,540
Thank you. I totally agree.

434
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:30,340
界對政府呢個計劃嘅反感嘅。

435
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:23,720
嗯，下一位係啊，新聞黨嘅鄧道坤先生，鄧生唔該。

436
01:13:55,190 --> 01:14:01,110
more elephants, the murder of more people, and a general increase in criminal activity.

437
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,060
令到誒誒提醒公眾呢啲象牙唔可以用做交易嘅，杜絕社會對非法動物製品嘅需求。

438
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:07,620
According to the Greenline Foundation, a thousand rangers have been killed in the line of duty in the past ten years, an average of almost two rangers killed every week.

439
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:34,900
在 addition， 我們 fully 支持提出的增加最大罰款， 並誠懇地希望它們會被用作懲戒， 因為不幸的是，最近歷史顯示，罰款 for 違法販賣和販賣象牙已經很低。

440
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:57,110
however, this is not just a conservation and animal welfare issue, but a human issue, impacting many through the violence and intimidation that individuals and organised networks use on a daily basis, especially in the field.

441
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:14,940
兩協會誠懇希望，不會有延誤通過擬議的修訂。時刻已到，然後香港可以真正聲稱是亞洲的世界城市，並幫助終止這殘酷的貿易。

442
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:22,140
as such, it is vital to impose a complete ban on the trade of ivory. It's a well-known fact: legal ivory is often used as a front for the illegal trade. Legal ivory trade anywhere in the world encourages poaching and slaughter of elephants.

443
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:39,710
多謝主席。新民黨支持政府逐步淘汰本地象牙物嘅計劃，同時間都要求政府同埋業界咧，商討一個合理嘅價錢，回購現時已經登記在並且領有合法管有許可證嘅公約後象牙。

444
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:42,750
conservation-wise, everyone is aware that elephants are a keystone species, playing a vital role in helping maintain forest and savanna ecosystems. The continued depletion of elephant numbers will have a major impact on many species of animals and plants.

445
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:26,810
It's not hard to comprehend the major welfare issue involved in the method of slaughter of the world's largest land animal, but it's also a well-recognised scientific fact that elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures who suffer deep emotional stress and trauma when group members die.

446
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:55,190
finally, we are against compensation being paid to traders. Hong Kong paying compensation would set a disastrous precedence, reinforcing the concept that ivory is a valuable commodity. Stockpiling would likely occur in countries where closure of the trade is also being considered. Paying compensation would only lead to the slaughter.

447
01:14:39,990 --> 01:15:00,000
希望公平同埋直接咁去處理本港剩餘嘅合法象牙存貨，令到政府嘅計劃可以順利咁推行。新聞黨建議政府參考台灣故宮博物院嘅做法，將收集到嘅所有象牙咧做保育嘅展覽，咁藉此教育公眾咧一個象牙保育嘅血淚史，亦都。

448
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:27,830
新民黨之前都見咗好多個誒香港象牙業嘅東主同埋工匠瞭解到咧，其實業界同樣都係支持政府逐步淘汰本地象牙嘅計劃，但係咧收例就令到政府當年授權合法及嘅並持有嘅公約後象牙咧係完全失去曬價值嘅呢一點，亦都係令到業。

449
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:03,770
please.

450
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,010
我係個非洲人。

451
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,200
I'm Shubert Morabu.

452
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,940
Greetings from Tanzania.

453
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,080
我為 for the elephants。

454
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,560
habari ma Bibi na mawana。

455
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:16,380
我帶嚟好消息，從我哋嘅土地嘅人民。

456
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,660
The loss of Africa's wild heritage weighs heavily upon my heart.

457
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:55,940
咁因此嚟嘅就多年就呢啲就就冇人肯要啦，咁亦都去難以清貨嘅。

458
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:22,880
我係嚟到 plead with you to do the right thing and shut down the ivory trade in Hong Kong.

459
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:30,150
more than sixty percent of Tanzania's elephants have been lost to poaching and trafficking over the last five years.

460
01:16:53,260 --> 01:17:02,860
好啊，我係Mr. Shubert Marabu from Global Search Global March for Elephants。

461
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:12,960
咁面對國際嘅貿貿啦，要本港在牙業界清貨，誒唔係話唔肯做，而係係做唔到。因此，就算政府表示計劃已經給予業界直接以零一年底嘅清貨緩衝期，對業界嚟講咧，都係得個講字。

462
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:50,630
越龍自然護理説喺過去多年咧，向業界簽發灌有許可證，授權業界合法持有並且銷售已經登記咗嘅公約後象牙。但係咧喺自從一九九零年實施嘅象牙國際禁貿開始咧，本港合法嘅象牙原料同埋只成品咧，都冇得流出境外嘅。

463
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:33,250
既然政府當年簽發管有許可證，確立公有後藏牙嘅合法性同埋價值，但係如今業界以往依法及嘅資產咧，將被去除咗嘅價值，而不或而不或任何嘅經濟補助咁噉，佢哋嘅部分咧其實可以理解嘅。噉，新民黨支持政府嘅計劃，要求政府同埋業界。

464
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:53,260
商討一個合理嘅價錢，回購已經登記嘅象牙，用做誒象牙嘅保育嘅展覽。咁直接解決計劃同埋業界對入嘅剛共僵共，並將收集得得到嘅所有象牙咧，誒都用咗一個保育嘅展覽啦，以實物同埋示例，有效咁杜絕社會對非法動物製品嘅需求。多謝主席。好，唔該。

465
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,510
我為 for my people.

466
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,910
was fifty one years old.

467
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,560
all these for some ivory carvings.

468
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:01,330
was a husband, a father and a good man.

469
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,620
保護最後的野蠻巨人， who roam our earth。

470
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,650
The Hong Kong ivory traders ask for government compensation.

471
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,240
我説，那應該沒有補償。

472
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,260
他 had received many death rays because of the ivory trade.

473
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,370
just about two weeks ago， a close friend of mine was killed.

474
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,090
為的 compensation to all my people who have died because of their business.

475
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:13,020
Thousands of rangers have also lost their lives to protect the last iconic giants of Africa.

476
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:41,100
做啲正嘢 for my people, my continent and all of our children too.

477
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:50,620
Let us do the right thing now. Let us shut down this trade that brings so much grief to so many.

478
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:07,560
was shot because he was protecting our heritage, killed for protecting our elephants.

479
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:31,480
They have had almost thirty years of notice that the ivory trade needs to stop because it is pushing elephants to extinction.

480
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:55,850
his name was Wayne Lotter， and because of his work， many leaders in the illegal ivory trade were caught and brought to justice.

481
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,290
點樣去咧？嚇！

482
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,940
基本法同埋係人權嘅。

483
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:08,230
我哋唔構成違反基本法，或者係咧嚇，即係咧嚇，誒侵害私人財產，所以喺依一方面咧嚇，我哋唔係一個法理上面嘅理由咧，我哋必須要噉樣做。

484
01:21:47,620 --> 01:22:01,010
同埋咧，喺我哋嘅啊啊攞咗好詳細嘅法律意見，我哋好審慎去考慮過依一點。噉嘅法律意見，我哋嘅結論就係話咧嚇，即係我哋依一個噉嘅禁令咧嚇，唔會違反《基本法》，亦都咧嚇唔會違反人權。

485
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:45,240
啊！誒，多謝主席喺度。我先多謝今日所有下議會嘅人士，你哋所表達嘅意見喺度咧嚇。我想簡單嘅嚇，將今日所我哋所聽到嘅一啲嘅重點嘅意見咧，喺度做一啲簡單嘅回應嘅。

486
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:38,180
咁亦都咧嚇，即係咧嚇有今日我哋見到，其實一個好重要嘅一個嘅討論咧嚇，大家提出嚟嘅要求就係話咧，係唔係我哋政府應該為咗呢個嘅禁令，我哋作出一啲嘅補償咧噉樣？嗱，我哋睇過好多國家嘅做法。

487
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:11,010
我thank you on behalf of Aquamiridian Future for Elephants, the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos, Okoa Tembo Tanzania and Generation Awakening. Thank you so much, Asante Sana. Thank you。啊，今日啦就所有啊六十二個團體同埋個人嘅發言我都聽過啦。咁而家咧就仲有大。

488
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:31,020
大概四十分鐘嘅時間噉，我而家咧首先請啊政府官員咧係綜合回應咗啊今日嘅團體同埋個人所提出嘅各種嘅問題先。噉啊，係咪啊？阿謝生，阿謝副局長，你會係代表政府回答嘅係咪啊？係係唔該你啊，謝生，係好。

489
01:19:46,100 --> 01:20:06,110
誒象牙貿易咧嚇，即係咧佢會導致獵殺大漲嘅，同埋咧引起好多非法嘅活動，同埋咧啊危害一啲人嘅性命咧嚇，係國際間咧一個嘅共識嘅，是一個嘅事實啊。喺依一方面咧嚇，我相信有好多嘅資料同埋事實係可以支持嘅，所以國際之間咧係有一個嘅共識，就係話咧我哋要點？

490
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:27,580
全面嘅淘汰喺依一個嘅象牙嘅貿易嗱，禁止象牙貿易咧就唔係一件嘅新鮮嘅事物，我哋唔係今日先開始講依一個嘅問題。事實上喺一九九零年嘅時間咧，已經咧係有一個嘅國際嘅禁令係推行喺香港，我哋都係立咗法係禁止咧即係象牙嘅貿易嘅。咁但係當

491
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:47,590
當然咧，一九九零年嘅時候咧嚇，大家諗嘅就係話咧，我哋明白到對於咧嚇嗰啲嘅誒象牙嗰個嘅行業嚇同埋象牙嘅經濟價值唔能夠咧一刀切，所以係一個嘅漫長同埋緩慢嘅一個嘅程序過程咧嚇嚟到係全面係取消。咁所以九零年嘅禁令咧係仍然係有一啲嘅象牙嘅貿易咧係可以。

492
01:20:47,590 --> 01:21:07,600
容許進行嘅，所以點解大家亦都，其實我哋聽到有啲人士就話咧嚇，即係阿漁護處啊嚇，佢哋仍然準許一啲嘅進口咧噉樣嚇，因為九零年嗰個禁令唔係一個全面嘅禁令，但係當時係已經提咗出嚟就係話咧嚇，我哋會逐步全部係去禁止依一個象牙貿易，所以當時政府亦都係幫助咧提出嚟就幫助好。

493
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:27,610
多嘅業界咧嚇，佢哋如何去轉型啦、轉嚇，同埋有啲嘅需要嘅再培訓啊噉樣，就係咧預備咧就係話咧全面係去淘汰嘅。嗱咁喺舊年嘅時候咧嚇，已經咧國際間咧就住依一樣嘢過咗二十七年啦嚇，所以係一個時候將依個禁令係全面係去推行啦啊。咁所以我哋香港見到咧，我哋作為一個國際，

494
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:47,620
大城市，我哋都需要咧喺呢一方面咧作出我哋嘅貢獻，所以我哋覺得我哋係時候，我哋喺香港，我哋推行一個嘅全面嘅一個禁令，就係所謂全面去禁止一個嘅象牙嘅貿易。嗱，當然我哋聽到有好多嘅意見提出嚟，第一點就係話我哋噉樣嘅禁止係唔係違反基本法咧？噉樣嗱，依個係一個好重要嘅議題，所以我哋。

495
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:21,400
因為咧嚇，實際上個禁令咧並冇嚇，即係咧沒收財產啊，或者咧我哋咧去咧嚇，即係啊去徵用係任何嘅財產。當然喺呢度咧，詳細嘅法律觀點我唔喺呢度嚟到再申述啦。但係可以同大家講就係，我哋係好詳細、好認真地考慮呢一點。我哋今日提出嚟嘅草案，我哋呢個嘅禁令係唔會違反。

496
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:58,470
已經香港唔係第一個地方全面禁止，我哋揾唔到一個嘅國家喺一方面，佢哋係作出補償嘅。咁當然唔係人哋唔作出補償，香港我哋就唔作出補償。噉我哋喺呢個問題上邊咧，我哋好細心去考慮過，我哋是否應該作出補償咧？噉樣嗱，頭先我已經講過啦，就係咧喺法理上邊嚟講嚇。

497
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,980
係一個唔應該做嘅一樣嘢嚟嘅。

498
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,990
我哋都要聽聞有一啲嘅人提到，就係話咧喺一啲嘅象牙嗰個嘅藝術啊文化嗰個嘅價值。

499
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:43,680
個背景嘅底下咧，我哋覺得就係話咧，我哋畀多一啲嘅時間，係一個合適嘅一個嘅過渡安排咧，係一個最好嘅方法。

500
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:32,430
增加幾多？咁但係呢個風險好明顯，唔能夠排除係嘛？一個人嘅性命都係重要嘅。如果我哋噉樣做嘅話咧嚇，係會導致人哋嘅風險增加、人命嘅嘅危害。

501
01:23:48,580 --> 01:24:00,540
個問題嘅時候，啊！我哋早排已經喺下下拆獲咗一批大規模嘅一個嘅走私，所以喺呢方面咧嚇，並非咧就係話咧係我哋係一個空洞喺度講呢啲嘅問題，依家係一個事實會發生嘅一個嘅問題。

502
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:45,460
嘅文化咧嚇，因為佢可能損害大象啊、損害損害人身安全嘅緣故咧，依啲嘅文化咧，可能應該要繼續落去。所以我喺呢方面，我哋覺得我哋依一個草案咧，已經係顧及到咧，就係話咧，係我哋保護大象同埋咧，係我哋保護藝術品之間嘅一個嘅平衡。

503
01:26:46,490 --> 01:27:02,730
咁第一都有提過，就話咧希望咧喺政府喺方面，我哋可以加強執法，同埋喺資源方面做一啲嘅配合。咁一方面，我可以向大家保證，啊，我哋咧政府一定會係咧嚇，會有足夠嘅人手咧嚇嚟到係執法，因為呢方面咧我哋覺得係重要嘅。咁喺呢方面咧，多謝各位。

504
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:28,570
我哋都考慮過，如果我哋真係作出賠償嘅時候，會唔會有一啲嘅後果咧？咁嗱，有幾點喺度，我希望大家去分享一下嘅。第一點就係咧嚇，象牙貿易之所以導致有獵殺大象同埋咧嗰啲非法嘅活動，同埋另外危害一啲嘅人身安全，就係因為象牙本身有價值。所以如果我哋喺一度咧嚇，我哋

505
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:48,580
係作出一啲嘅賠償嘅話咧，事實上就係話政府係出錢去收買一啲嘅象牙，嗱噉係必定會咧係引起一啲嘅出邊係會喺個社會國際間啊全球裏邊咧會有好多嘅謠言嘅產生，香港政府收購象牙，嗱係會引起咧即係咧嚇走私活動呢啲嘅猖獗嘅情況係會出現嘅。我哋已經見到就係咧嚇我哋討論緊呢。

506
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:20,830
第二點就係咧，如果我哋繼續啊用錢嚟到係去補償、去收買呢啲象牙嘅時候咧，呢啲嘅信息再傳播出去嘅話咧，會導致更多嘅一啲嘅大象嘅捕殺、捕獵嘅活動，甚至可能咧嚇會到保護大象嗰啲嘅人咧，更多人畀人殺害嗱。當然喺度我唔能夠畀到咗一個咧，即係嚇數據嚟就話咧嚇會有個風險。

507
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:52,840
另外一點就係咧嚇，我哋見到全球而家開始係慢慢去啊，係去全面去禁止呢個象牙貿易，直到現今冇一個國家作出補償。如果香港作出補償嘅話咧，我哋會係第一個嘅地方，係嘛？作為一個嘅先例，我哋禁止象牙，我哋用金錢去作出補償。嗱，唔係所有嘅地方。

508
01:24:52,840 --> 01:25:12,850
方所有嘅政府，佢哋都有噉嘅財力去作出呢個補償。香港如果作為一個先例嘅話咧，可能係會阻礙咗呢個地方佢哋嘅做進進同樣嘅禁令。所以我哋覺得咧，依一個噉樣嘅作出補償呢個行為咧，嚇對於我哋要保護大象嚇，要保護嗰啲咧嚇，即係保護大象嗰啲人嘅性命嚟講咧，我哋作出補償咧。

509
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:35,270
咁但係大家提出嚟嗰個問題，我哋點樣去處理咧？嗱，我哋已經畀咗二十七年啊，去嗰個行業去去慢慢去去嚟到係去啊預備下，即係呢個嘅全面嘅禁令。我哋都聽到業界佢哋講就，其實喺過往二十七年咧，佢哋已經係將佢哋嘅象牙銷售咗有九成，剩翻係一成嘅啫。嗱喺一個噉樣。

510
01:25:44,070 --> 01:26:04,080
同埋咧，即係咧，我哋都會明白到，可能有一啲嘅從業員啊，佢哋因為噉嘅緣故嚇，佢哋需要轉業，我哋可能喺方面咧，我哋會繼續去睇下點樣去幫到佢哋嚇，佢哋嘅再培訓咧，或者有冇一啲嘅專業方面嘅安排啦噉樣。所以我哋覺得嗰一個咧，先係一個最好嘅方法咧嚇，嚟到係處理依一個㗎。我哋今次引入呢個禁令，依一個嘅做法，噉。

511
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:30,300
啊，喺方面我哋都考慮到嘅，所以喺我哋今次我哋嘅修訂案裏邊咧嚇，我哋都保留一啲咧古董嘅象牙嚇，佢哋嗰個嘅啊啊嘅闊面，讓呢啲嘅古董嘅象牙咧嚇嚇，因為真係一啲嘅藝術品啊，我哋讓佢可以確實有一啲嘅闊面。但係咧，我哋唔會覺得咧嚇，即係象牙工業啊、象牙雕刻呢個噉樣。

512
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:23,050
係啊，多謝副局長。誒，有邊位委員係想提問問題嘅，請而家舉一舉手先。啊，睇睇一啊，葉劉淑儀議員，跟住啊，邵家輝議員，仲有冇同事想問問題啊？舉定手啦。噉我就由於時間都幾多，我就啊啊，郭佩凡議員，誒，或者每人五。

513
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,820
我誒。

514
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,240
牙咧係銷售咗九成。

515
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:29,100
係，啊副局長。

516
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,850
唔準買賣，冇可能賣得出嘅。

517
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,600
噉我哋點解唔可以幫下自己人咧？點解唔可以幫下本地人咧？

518
01:28:54,980 --> 01:29:01,420
啊，副局長，請你回應啊，唔該，係啊，好多謝議員嗰個嘅意見。

519
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:26,020
咁容易轉型咧？即係我哋而家唔好講賠償啦，嚇點樣安置、點樣處理，政府都要考慮噉啊！

520
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:34,960
出去咗九成，佢哋只係剩翻一成，所以喺而家我哋翻去咧一個問題咧，重要問題就我哋係唔係作出一啲金錢上邊嘅補償？

521
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:53,460
嚇！保護大象，全世界都知㗎啦！我哋根本已知道曬、聽過曬㗎啦。流淚嘅故事知道啦，咁點解亦都唔唔連問下本地嘅嘅誒商人咧？

522
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:16,820
要諗下本地人嘅生計啊！阿阿處長，你話叫佢哋，即係嗰啲工匠係咪年紀好大？呢個一個dying trade、dying profession，冇出路，你叫人再培訓學乜啫？

523
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:43,060
分鐘先啦，嚇！阿葉劉淑儀議員先啦，唔該你。多謝主席，我諗我哋在座都冇乜人會反對呢條條例，就係終止象牙嘅貿易同埋係嚴打走私象牙呢個原則係冇人會反對嘅。即係頭先好多發，多謝咁多位參加。

524
01:27:43,060 --> 01:28:03,070
家啦，都包括小朋友啦，係嘛？即係小朋友都咁瞭解呢個問題，可見保護大象嘅團體人士，佢嘅宣傳係好到家，人人都知，小朋友都知，係嘛？我哋唔會反對㗎。問題就係我哋除咗要憐憫啲大象之外，都要。

525
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:37,120
係嘛，即係我唔你可以唔講賠償㗎，係問題點處理呢啲人士咧嚇，即係佢哋好多存有嘅象牙合法㗎啊，有啲博物館，台灣嘅故宮博物館佢都合法係係擺放呢啲嘅象牙、西牛角嘅產品㗎，噉。

526
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:24,630
如何去幫助嗰個嘅行業去轉型，同埋咧幫助一啲從業嘅人員呢一點咧，我哋係完全嘅同意嘅。所以我哋咧係亦都會繼續同嗰個嘅行業去傾，我哋點樣去幫助佢哋。但係嗱，我哋睇翻一個嘅事實，就係頭先我哋已經講到就話咧喺過去嗰二十七年裏邊咧，佢哋已經係將佢哋嗰啲嘅。

527
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:55,250
係因為嗰啲嘅賬額嗱，咁喺依一方面咧，我哋嘅立場咧係清晰嘅。我哋覺得政府唔應該為咗剩低嗰啲嘅賬額再出一個嘅補償啊！我哋應該做嘅就係話咧，我哋畀足夠畀多啲嘅時間佢，廿七年佢哋賣咗九成，我哋畀多五年。即係阿局長，我真係對唔住啊！對唔住啊，局長。如果你話而家係知道五年後完全。

528
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:18,230
係咪？即係頭先好多都發言人話點解佢唔賣埋佢咁？而家人都知道冇得再買賣㗎啦。即係如果我去買都係可能買一個好細嘅廢紙放喺屋企做紀念品，希望會被拉啦。你叫佢未來五年再賣咗七十七十五噸係冇可能㗎嘛？轉型都冇可能。佢嘅近半年幾好大，你都知㗎啦。

529
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,180
象牙貿易。

530
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:31,910
唔係佢哋做喎。

531
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:54,260
其實我哋咪支持咧，我絕對唔支持。

532
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:29,670
本身做開象牙嗰啲朋友有乜關係咧？

533
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,910
好唔該，阿小家輝議員唔該。哦，唔該主席。嗱，嗯。

534
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:08,310
係咪？因為亦都係會誒鼓吹到有機會啲咁大笨象畀獵殺嘅，係咪？

535
01:32:55,170 --> 01:33:02,400
就算講話喂，而家即係香港有啲噉嘅象牙冇嘢，其實繼續啊出入口嘅話，其實我都唔同意嘅。

536
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:45,740
本身係一九九零年嘅時候，你哋政府發牌畀嗰啲人有七百幾噸，佢哋可以繼續喺呢度賣。嗰啲象牙係二十七年前嗰啲大笨象已經死咗㗎啦喎！

537
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:24,620
誒副局長有冇補充啊？你誒我再補充一點就係咧嚇協助從業員同埋咧喺我哋作出金錢嘅賠償咧，其實係兩件嘅事情嚇。如何協助從業員咧，我哋會繼續探討；但係作出金錢嘅賠償咧，我哋真係係細心考慮過之後咧，覺得係唔應該做嘅一樣嘢啦。

538
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:25,640
誒，今日其實在座有好多朋友即係誒，去佢哋嘅表達啦，即係大笨象點樣慘啦，嗰啲誒誒保護員點樣即係被殺害啦，即係等等嗰啲噉嘅情況，即係好血淋淋。但係我想講，其實呢啲情況關我哋香港。

539
01:31:49,420 --> 01:32:06,850
係嘛？佢哋嘅宣傳咁叻，小朋友都知啊。點解唔可以區分啫？我真係唔明白，係咁籠統咁一棍打死曬我哋啲工匠同埋我哋啲商人。佢哋已經好努力過去咁多年，儘量去去處理啦，去咗九成啦，剩低一啲。政府都完全鐵石心腸，唔理佢哋嘅咩？

540
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:49,780
我想講咧，局長，嗯，我哋未即係對於嗰啲喺嗯非洲嗰啲大笨象同埋嗰啲嘅誒保護員，即係佢哋畀啊獵殺，係咪其實我哋唔同情咧？唔係，我係非常之同情佢哋，係嘛？對於一啲非法嘅啊。

541
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:49,390
係誒，我我哋好明白議員你嗰個意見。咁但係頭先我都再講翻就係咧嚇，我哋依個禁令咧嚇，其實要全面淘汰象牙貿易咧，唔係今日先開始講嘅。二十七年前已經係講呢一樣嘢嘅，所以咧嚇，即係咧啲人咧嚇，即係對於呢一樣象牙將來係唔可以再買賣呢個噉嘅預期咧嚇，唔係一。

542
01:30:49,390 --> 01:31:09,400
一件新鮮嘅事物係一個咧，已經係幾十年嘅一件嘅事。今時我哋去到嘅地點啦，就係話咧，我哋真係要落閘啦，今日要落閘啦。噉我哋明白今日落閘可能的確有啲嘅問題，所以我哋畀多一啲嘅時間。我哋亦都從呢個角度睇，就係的確好多長壽員，其實佢哋已經係一個好大嘅年紀。再幾多五年嘅時候，可能好自然地，佢哋都會退休。

543
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:29,410
嘅係咪咁？所以喺好多嘅情況咧，個情況下，我哋覺得時間嚟到處理依一樣嘢，可能係好過咧。即係咧，我哋攞出金錢嚇嚟到係做出一個補償啦。我我你考慮希望你要用有想像力啲方法處理，即係我聽到發言人擔心補償，其實佢啲宣傳好叻㗎，點解唔可以區？

544
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:49,420
分嚇補償traders同埋適當啊照顧我哋本地嘅嘅工人啊嚇誒持有象牙啊係嘛唔可以話誒好好誒即係籠統噉話賠償，即係ivory traders噉就會助長獵曬兩回事嚟㗎嘛。

545
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:26,200
而呢啲你有冇孖數咧？

546
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:49,840
做，而你而家唔畀佢做。

547
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:03,350
食呢一樣嘢，我真係唔係好通喎。

548
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,030
即係唔係好通喎？佢擺喺屋企。

549
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,520
呢廿幾年發生嗰啲嘅獵殺，關嗰啲人咩事咧？

550
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:24,170
啊！漁護署同我講，有一萬三千幾件嚟咗香港。嗰一萬三千幾件嘅重量，其實唔知幾多。

551
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:17,580
睇下賣唔到咧，就因為當年喺一九九零年嘅時候，你喺公約前嘅話，你繼續畀佢喺度買啊嘛。

552
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:36,010
而且象牙而家講緊嗰啲係本身已經係嚟咗，係咪？呢漁護署咧？

553
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:57,040
講呢啲唔係啊嘛，嗰啲係私人嘅朋友啲錢嚟㗎嘛，係咪？嗱，我同在座好多有外國嗰啲人士嗰啲朋友嘅話咧，大家冇衝突。

554
01:34:50,170 --> 01:35:00,330
佢有啲係咪人賣曬？嗰啲係一啲資產嚟嘅。你講畀我聽，基本法內裏唔何，即係嗰啲唔係叫侵佔誒財產。

555
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:28,630
即係阿葉劉淑儀嘅議員喺度都提緊，即係如果你覺得唔用一個誒錢，即係嘅方式，我唔知啫，係咪？即係你你你有乜方法可以令到佢哋嗰啲財產得到保障咧？係咪？

556
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:13,370
我都唔支持繼續有呢啲噉樣嘅貿易，但係而家你本身有嗰班人，其實你都要處理佢㗎，係咪公義？唔係講人多就公義，嗰三百幾個就唔係就人少就唔需要有公義咩？我我唔同意喎。

557
01:33:51,430 --> 01:34:11,440
你哋講話去買九成賣嚟賣去都賣唔到。阿阿阿局長，你要講清楚。其實除咗你一九九零年嘅時候，你有嗰幾百噸擺咗喺之外，話其實你當年喺公約前嘅獎額，你繼續畀佢賣啊嘛。其實嗰度有幾大數入咗嚟香港啊，唔係呢七百幾噸喺度。點解啲人賣嚟賣？

558
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:47,860
今日重點唔係在乎於我哋畀唔畀佢做一個啊買賣，因為其實你問我，即係我相信而家大出世都係咁在乎就係嗰啲本身喺香港一路做開嘢嗰啲朋友，嗰啲傳統工藝，我哋香港政府發牌講畀佢聽，佢係可以合法地去做。

559
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:27,580
佢賣唔到，佢本身係攞成副身家嗰啲，準備要破產，佢擺曬啲嘢攞裏邊。其實佢係可以做㗎嘛。你今日搬咗個龍門講畀你，唔可以做。如果啲樓你聽日講話唔可以買賣嘅話，我諗全部啲人都要走佬喎，全部破產嘅喎。你可以繼續可以hold住佢。有啲人可能真係攞嚟住，但係好多係我係投資㗎嘛，係咪？我喺香港。

560
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:47,590
都係資本主義社會，其實點解可以噉樣講咧？局長其實我真係唔係好同意。有啲朋友講話要禁，好似中國都禁到，但係據瞭解，其實中國嗰啲持牌可以賣象牙啲，全部都係國有企業嚟嘅國家嘅國家話要禁就梗係禁啦。嗰啲全部都國家財產嚟嘅，但係依家呢啲香。

561
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:09,190
我支持少啊！

562
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,000
好，啊，郭佩凡議員。

563
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:20,680
我收到呢個消息，我好沉痛。

564
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:07,620
而家判刑嘅話，幾個月。

565
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,890
但係估唔到，即係八月十六號，佢就畀人槍殺咗。

566
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:42,160
我哋頭先今日有好多嘅朋友都有提到啊，Mr.啊Wing Lauter，啊，佢係我朋友。

567
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:50,750
我二零一五年嘅時候喺坦桑尼亞，我特登去佢個PAMS Foundation，佢好詳細咁同我講咗。

568
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:46,130
其實你本身已經係抹低曬所有嘅資料。你話為侵其他啲國家啲侵啲象牙入嚟啊，嗱嗱聲會入口喎。你哋有記錄㗎嘛？你哋冇把關㗎咩？咁多年？

569
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:11,700
佢同我哋講：只要香港繼續買賣象牙，只要呢個黑市走私市場繼續存在，殺象同埋殺人就會沒完沒了。

570
01:38:51,070 --> 01:39:01,560
佢係點樣做調查嘅工作？點樣去誒去測試？點樣去訓練啲ranger？佢哋每一日面對幾大嘅生命危險？

571
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:34,350
白人，白人因你而死。誒，其實係咪真係咁遙遠咧？啲ranger即係啲巡護員，即係被殺。其實真係唔係咁遙遠啊。誒。

572
01:37:49,680 --> 01:38:00,750
係話咧嚇，我再講就係話咧嚇，我哋想我哋真係詳細心去睇過，用金錢嚟做啲賠償咧係唔合當嘅。但係如何去幫助一啲嘅從業員咧嚇，嗰度我哋可以繼續探討。

573
01:36:46,500 --> 01:37:04,210
係咪冇把關先？你全部都有影晒嘅，定係你哋做得唔清楚先？如果係嘅話，責任就喺政府嗰度，唔係喺佢哋嗰度。佢哋全部都係有影相嘅，有曬登記喺度嘅。賣一件就少一件，佢有曬number㗎嘛。你外邊嗰啲入嚟嘅話，佢侵入嚟嘅話，嗰啲咪全部都犯法，咪即刻拉得咯。

574
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:27,870
十年、廿年、三年，中心監禁都冇問題啊！嗰啲犯法嘅我哋唔會幫佢嘅。而家係講緊嗰啲守法嘅商人。聽你個教師講，嗰啲全部做象牙都係非法嘅，我唔同意。你唔好將啲非法嗰啲犯法嗰啲人去撚埋一啲守法嘅人，係唔公道嘅。

575
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:49,680
阿阿邵議員，你畀少少時間，阿阿副局長你可以回應啊？唔該，阿副局長係，誒，我即係想講誒兩點嘅啫，即係第一點就係咧，我哋真係睇過喺法理上邊咧嚇，我哋所提出嚟呢個禁令咧嚇，並冇違反基本法或者係維權法，詳細喺度，可能我唔講啦。噉啊，另外一點就係。

576
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:23,290
係誒，多謝主席。噉啊，首先好多謝今日出席嘅所有嘅人士，畀我哋嘅寶貴嘅意見。咁咧就誒誒誒啊，邵家輝議員講咗幾次話誒關我哋乜嘢事，即係像同埋誒ranger被殺噉。但係我我想講咧，就係你不殺。

577
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:35,960
同。

578
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,950
好傷心。

579
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,610
我都唔知講咩好。

580
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:40,010
今次嘅法案。

581
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:12,130
關我哋香港咩事咧？

582
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,940
立法禁止賬户買賣。

583
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:14,440
偏偏就係關我哋香港事咯。

584
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,340
槍林彈雨咁搏鬥。

585
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:05,070
佢哋嘅生命唔係應該由人類主宰。

586
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:42,280
對住啲可能係恐怖組織。

587
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:10,230
所以我唔同意話非洲嘅像非洲嘅人。

588
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:49,990
佢比我危險得多。我哋喺香港可以做嘅立法，只不過係微不足道嘅一步。

589
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:34,220
因為佢同我講，佢話我做緊嘅嘢去推動禁止象牙買賣係好危險嘅工作。我同佢講，對比起佢日日喺非洲。

590
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:24,840
所以我相信誒今日好多朋友誒都話支持立法禁止象牙買賣，問題就係對本地嘅象牙商人應唔應該作出賠償？

591
01:39:51,760 --> 01:40:01,790
香港同非洲係咪真係咁遙遠咧？非洲個象係咪淨係屬於非洲咧？非洲個象唔係淨係屬於非洲嘅，非洲大象係屬於我哋所有地球嘅人類，屬於地球。

592
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:38,240
誒呢個問題其實我哋已經諗咗好耐，誒我哋亦都有好多個爭拗，誒甚至閉黨亦都拗咗好耐，咁但係最終咧，誒民建聯嘅立場係一致嘅，我哋係支持政府。

593
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,350
作出賠償。

594
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:31,470
係咪有啲噉樣嘅情形咧？

595
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:58,190
而家你畀咗二十七年，賣咗百分之九十。

596
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,470
即係如果唔係嘅話，而家我哋係面對緊乜嘢情形咧？

597
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:40,060
我想政府回應，唔該，主席。誒，副局長，唔該你。

598
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:02,030
香港究竟有冇象牙商人係靠象牙為生？

599
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:29,140
我禁咗象牙買賣又唔賠償嘅話咧，我哋就有好多象牙商人係會瞓街啦。

600
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:08,450
剩翻百分之十。今日好多發言嘅人，誒象牙商人都講嗰啲係碎料，嗰啲係賣唔去嘅。呢頭佢哋話賣唔去，但係呢頭佢哋又入口好多。

601
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:54,770
都要合理先得㗎，個問題係唔合理啊嘛，係咪？有乜嘢生意會保證你賣賣到百分之一百嘅全貨嘅咧？呢個世界有冇噉嘅生意咧？

602
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:51,150
係誒，我或者我請誒漁護署嘅同事嚇講解一下，係喺入口嗰度嗰個嘅情況，咁以及咧而家香港從業員喺嗰個嘅情況係點樣嘅？好誒。

603
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:57,380
誒，如果我哋作出賠償嘅話，我哋只會引嚟更加多嘅誒屍殺，非洲會殺更加多嘅象，更加多嘅人。咁呢樣嘢，我哋香港係咪可以負擔得起咧？咁呢個係我哋真係要思考嘅問題。

604
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:43,030
地方入口嘅嚇公約前嘅象牙係咪流曬喺香港度賣咧？如果一方面又話自己手上面嗰百分之十萬唔使，一方面又入口呢啲係做緊乜嘢生意咧？我真係好想了解。我相信政府應該一定有一定嘅記錄。

605
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:28,860
象牙咁噉，我都想問一問政府。佢哋話你哋唔禁止佢哋入口嗰啲per convention嘅象牙，英國政府有問題，香港政府有問題。當然我都想問佢哋，不過而家佢哋唔喺度。邊個叫佢哋入口嘅咧？咁入咗嚟嗰啲象牙去咗邊咧？政府係咪有record嘅咧？政府可唔可以講畀我哋聽喺英國入口或者其他？

606
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:22,490
以往咁多年嚟嚇，過往呢十幾年每年香港本土嘅成象牙成交量係幾多？足唔足以養起個三百幾人咧？三百幾間公司咧？呢個我諗政府亦都有數字，政府可唔可以講清講楚畀我哋香港大眾聽？究竟而家我哋面對緊嘅一個咩嘢嘅問題係咪？如果

607
01:42:51,430 --> 01:43:11,440
唔該，唔該，係係唔該，主席。咁咧，或者我咧就喺度咧講一講咧，就嗰個象牙嗰個啊入口個情況。因為頭先咧都聽到咧好多誒特別係業界嘅朋友講咧，就話誒有好多所謂嘅歐洲鳥咧，就係喺禁令即係一個九年禁令之後，國際禁令之後咧，都係可以入口嘅。咁其實嗰個咧其實。

608
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:31,450
就我哋誒頭先講緊咧，就係一九九零年之後咧，其實嗰啲象牙咧就係誒國際誒禁禁止貿易㗎啦。咁但係咧，仲有啲我哋叫做公約前象啊，即係一九七五年同埋七六年咧，就分別係呢個亞洲象同埋呢個非洲象咧，嗰啲象牙咧就根據公約咧，其實喺個九零年國際禁令之後都係可以。

609
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,880
先至畀佢啊入口嘅。

610
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:45,220
係邊位同事可以回答啊？

611
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:35,510
咧，誒出入口嘅，咁其實嗰啲誒。

612
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:42,300
check過，咁若果係而冇check過或者有check過，你check咗幾多？你可唔可以話畀我哋聽？

613
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:12,490
入口嘅象牙咧，係入口香港之前要經過漁護署授權嘅人員咧檢查嘅。

614
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:55,860
公約前嘅象牙咧，根據我哋嘅記錄咧，就喺過往嘅十年咧，其實有大概有十三點九噸，誒加埋咧就係一萬九千七百件嘅呢啲噉嘅公約前象牙咧，就係入口香港。咁喺同期咧，就其實咧，大部分呢啲公約前象牙咧係有十點九噸，同埋。

615
01:43:55,860 --> 01:44:15,870
有三百八十件咧，就係出口再出口香港嘅。咁誒，點解有兩個數咧？即係有嗰個重量啦，同埋有一啲咧就係件數啦。因為頭先啊，有議員都提問誒，會唔會淨得個件數？點解又唔知個重量嘅？咁因為咧，其實大部分呢啲嘅工藝前象牙咧係一啲古董啊，或者啲裝飾物噉，或者譬如一啲。

616
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:35,880
啊！鋼琴佢成個鋼琴咧就有啲琴鍵，就係用象牙製嘅噉，所以咧嗰啲就計唔到重，就一件件噉樣計。咁但係所有呢啲噉嘅公約前象牙咧，都係根據咧一啲咧誒規定咧，先至有喺準許證嘅制度之下咧，先至可以入口香港嘅。咁入咗香港之前咧，亦都要經過我哋授權人員咧。

617
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:55,890
去檢查嗰啲證件係唔係合法，先至可以入口嚟香港。出口嗰陣時亦都係需要檢查嘅。咁呢啲咧係國際上誒，根據國際禁令之後咧，都係容許根據公約啊去容許呢個啊出入口嘅啊。噉啊，我嘅補充係咁多唔該主席未講清楚，咁入咗啊，我諗。

618
01:44:55,890 --> 01:45:15,900
啊，郭碧凡議員啊，我畀阿陳林斌議員問。講一半。阿陳林斌議員唔該你嚇。誒，多謝主席。我相信咧，即係誒政府喺上次我哋誒即係我哋嘅委員會上面開會之後咧，就誒答翻我啲問題。當中咧，我令我哋更加睇得清楚咧，成件事係噉樣嘅。一個咧就係本地嘅。

619
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:35,910
市場政府咧已經係影曬嗰啲相㗎啦。喺公約前咧，其實一實施之後咧，政府係有曬嗰啲象眼記錄。另一批咧就係歐洲鳥嚟嘅咁誒。而家我哋認為咧，引起成個殺戮咧最嚴重嘅就係歐洲嚇嗰方面嘅問題誒。係。

620
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:55,920
喺政府答我嘅問題嘅時候咧，我我當時係希望政府話畀我聽，歐盟裡面邊啲國家係已經係禁止象牙出口。但係政府話畀我聽嘅咧，就係歐盟佢哋喺誒最新嘅指引係二零一七年七月一號起咧，歐盟係停止所有供藥前嘅原料。

621
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:15,930
但係咧，製成品係可以繼續出口嘅。咁即係話畀我哋所有人聽，其實如果佢啊嗰個象牙唔係原料，佢話即係喺當地雕刻咗，佢話嗰件咧係一個誒，即係製成品咧，佢係可以繼續賣嚟香港嘅。噉我哋香港係咪一定要收先？

622
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:35,940
若果我哋唔希望有非洲有人殺大笨象，其實我哋係咪應該阻止呢一個窗口咧？嗰啲證書，我想問下政府過去有冇人check過嗰啲誒入口同埋嗰啲證書有冇人做假，有冇人喺證書上面做手腳，或者甚至乎做買賣？你哋有冇去？

623
01:46:46,110 --> 01:47:06,120
好啊！阿阿陳生，唔該，你係多謝主席。咁咧就即係頭先我所講咧，因為咧嗰個誒講緊嗰個入口嗰個咧，就講緊啲公約前嘅象牙。咁公約前嘅象牙咧，我頭先都講過，就係話所有公約前嘅象牙咧，佢一定要有一張咧誒嗰個證書，跟住咧就陪誒連住嗰個。

624
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:32,780
咁誒，議員有問，究竟嗰啲證件會唔會有造假咧？噉啊，如果我哋對啲證件有懷疑咧，其實我哋係會向翻嗰個出證嗰個公約國同埋呢個公約嘅秘書處咧，去咧去核實究竟嗰張證係咪真定假嘅。咁所有誒呢啲噉嘅批次嘅貨物，如果入嚟咧，我哋都係經過詳細嘅檢查。

625
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:24,440
都係咧，經過咧出口公約局。我我唔好意思，陳生，我淨係問你，你哋有冇做carbon dating，核實嗰啲料入嚟係真係同嗰張證書所講嘅嘢符合嘅？

626
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:31,580
尊重佢哋嘅生命，或者見到呢個呢個危機，所以要做一啲功夫嚇。我哋而家嘅分歧係在於究竟賠唔賠嚇。其實呢個咧，我同誒。

627
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:18,360
人權或者生命權嘅時候咧，唔係講人數，唔係鬥人數，唔係少數服從多數。如果少數服從多個大笨象，就係少數，佢哋冇票添，冇聲添。但係我哋會因為

628
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:47,640
長毛啊，梁國雄，即係佢而家未DQ之前咧，我哋都有啲分歧嚇，即係長毛佢就傾向應該要考慮嗰個賠償嚇，咁所以我今日都想即係趁呢個機會同政府討論下啊。你問我，我就覺得如果按量賠償咧。

629
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:33,970
我哋政府咧就係淨係睇嗰種證書啊！如果有問題咧，就係問翻當地。咁當地出得嗰種證書，佢梗係話畀你真㗎啦。咁政府有冇抽查過喺透過呢個渠道入口嘅？你有冇做過carbon dating？有冇check過有幾多係係假嘅咧？係陳生，唔該你。

630
01:50:45,030 --> 01:51:04,160
嘅，其實誒過去我哋喺事務委員會好多團體嘅朋友都上咗嚟表達佢哋嘅意見，咁今日亦都有好多，其實嘅意見誒都好相近，大家嗰個立場我哋都即係都基本上係聽過，我好同意邵家輝議員講，我哋講到公義。

631
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:55,170
咁誒，其實咧就呢啲噉嘅公約前嘅象牙咧誒，過往嚟講喺公約嚟講係可以準許出入口。噉啊，最近咧由於呢個國際間咧都係啊實施呢個有呢個實施呢個禁止象牙嘅出入口呢個政策，咁所以咧，譬如歐洲嗰度咧，其實。

632
01:47:55,170 --> 01:48:15,180
就啱啱今年七月就實施咗一個指引，噉就話所有成歐盟嘅成員國咧就停止出口呢啲噉嘅象牙嘅原料㗎啦。咁但係根據公約，其實其他如果佢冇禁制嗰啲咧，譬如一啲工藝品嗰啲咧，根據公約仍然係可以出入口嘅。係唔該。誒，主席個問題就係喺呢一度啦，即係話我。

633
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:54,540
誒個證書嗰度咧，其實所有呢出口嘅證咧都係有啲特定嘅規格嘅。咁所以咧，就如果我哋對個證書係有懷疑嘅話咧，我哋問翻當地嗰個出口啊，供約國佢嗰個誒有關當局咧有冇做carbon dating咧？咁誒嗱，呢啲因為出口證嗰啲咧，佢其實咧出口國咧，佢有。

634
01:48:54,540 --> 01:49:14,550
有站咧，係一定係啊正確。即係你係信可唔可以咁講？你係信佢啊嗰張證書，但係你自己入嚟香港漁護處係唔會同你核實嗰啲料究竟係公約前定係公約後咧？係陳生係啊，我想啊呢度補充翻就係其實就誒所有呢啲證件。

635
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:45,000
唔錯嗱，呢個咧我要解釋一下咧，就有定冇得㗎啦。你講誒，我我我諗唔可以就咁簡單答有定冇啦，而係話用嗰個誒碳素斷代法咧，嗰個方法咧係核實一啲象牙咧究竟個年代係幾多咧？我哋有做嘅。咁但係咧就佢嗰個方法咧都有佢嘅限制，唔係話咧有啲。

636
01:49:45,000 --> 01:50:05,010
即係譬如有啲啊啊，所有嘅象牙啊，譬如一個古董嘅鋼琴，我哋係要作為一啲啊，用一啲破壞嘅方法，要齊一啲樣本咧，先至可以去做得到。咁嗰個唔係嗰個問題，而係話出口呢啲國家嘅供應國，佢係確實咗，係證明係確。

637
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:37,930
唔該曬。

638
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:59,870
好難過。

639
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:51,020
思考係點咧？噉樣係啊，謝生。

640
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:14,770
同我哋香港合法嘅商人賣緊廿幾年前以前嘅象牙有乜關係？

641
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:07,470
如果佢同我冇關係嘅話，我唔會有感覺嘅。頭先嗰一節我講得好清楚，就係佢哋被獵殺。

642
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:55,740
但係副局長頭先喺即係回應一啲議員嘅時候，佢話有啲幫助，佢唔係金額上嘅幫助。咁嗰方面可唔可以講多少少？你哋考慮緊啲乜嘢？係副局長。

643
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:44,470
嚇，以致咧嚇會造成咧嚇即係有一啲嘅大將被殺，同埋咧最擔心嘅就係甚至有一啲嚇其他嘅從業人員，即係保護大將嘅人咧都係讓佢被殺，所以我覺得依個噉樣嘅風險咧，我哋覺得係唔應該係去去承受嘅。

644
01:52:51,300 --> 01:53:10,300
係啊！好多謝議員嘅問題。其實我哋都有詳細考慮過，即係嚇啊，另外一種唔係按量嘅。咁但係正如你你都講過啦，就係話咧嚇，我哋發覺啊，信息傳遞，尤其是一個國際間嘅信息傳遞咧，好多時候真係係唔清晰嘅，亦都好容易畀人哋惡意去扭曲嘅。

645
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:25,020
誒一啲公約前嘅賬啊，即係其實你係冇做嘅，係咪？可唔可以咁講啊？因為嗰個方法你覺得唔可信啊？陳林彬議員，我畀嗱，而家我手頭上就有陳志全議員會第一次問問題，跟住係邵家輝議員、郭炳凡議員啊。陳林彬議員係咪在上？OK，嗱，係咁多啦，四位啊，陳林彬、啊陳志全議員第一次，跟住邵家輝議員，跟住。

646
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:45,030
主角配發言，跟住係陳恆淵。噉啊，陳志全議員咧係五分鐘，而其他三位第二次問問題嘅議員四分鐘。我哋就酌量去誒將呢一個會議延長，直到你哋係係咪問完曬嘅問題為止啊？阿陳志全先啦，唔該。係誒，多謝主席。我都係支持全面禁止象牙貿易。

647
01:51:47,950 --> 01:52:07,960
就一定唔得，因為會令到更多嘅大笨象喺呢段期間被獵殺，甚至係嗰啲守護者都會有生命危險。跟住，如果唔係按量，而係一個你叫佢賠償、補償或者援助噉樣呢個。

648
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:27,970
又點咧？噉我都請教咗好多人嘅意見，咁得到嘅答案就係其實都係可面側面啦。因為呢啲信息咧非常之混亂，即係如果誒有一個信息發放出嚟話香港係有得賠，即係佢唔畀你按量賠，定係買翻即係一次個補償或者援助，佢都係覺得。

649
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:47,980
係賠，亦都會令到誒嗰件事件會惡化嚇。咁呢個我就想問下政府喺呢方面，即係嗰個有冇一個考慮？即係按量就係絕對，我係覺得嗰個係萬劫不復嘅嚇。但係如果係另一種援助或者點樣係呢啲嘅？

650
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:30,590
誒好簡單啫嚇，即係嚇，我哋而家我哋提出依個法案嚇，補償依啲嘢，我哋都仲喺度政府嘅立場咁清晰嘅時候都好咧。我哋都見到早排係有大規模嘅走私嘅活動出現，啊噉，所以我哋覺得咧嚇，即係如果政府話有補償，無論你係乜嘢嘅形式咧嚇，出邊一定會造成一啲嘅信息嘅扭曲。

651
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:17,150
係啊嗱，我我講兩句，然後我請啊啊啊，我哋同事去補充咧，就係咧，香港就係咧，如果喺金錢上邊嘅啊，即係係補償咧，我哋覺得就唔應該做嘅。但係咧嚇，如何去幫助一啲嘅嚇從業員去係去啊去轉業啊，一啲嘅再培訓啊，或者係點樣令到佢啊，即係可以去。

652
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:37,160
去嚇可以做到其他嘢咧，咁呢度我哋相信我哋係可以去繼續去探討嘅。噉我哋都講嘅就係話咧嚇，我哋其中嘅重點就係咧，我哋覺得一個長啲嘅時間咧，可能係一個最合適嘅時間嚟到慢慢回收呢樣。點解我哋話五年咧嚇嚟到淘汰呢樣嘢咧？就係我哋覺得可能嚇好啲，因為頭先我哋都知道好多長，其實佢年紀都好大㗎啦，係嘛？如果我

653
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,870
係啊。

654
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,540
你有曬記錄嘅。

655
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:33,680
嗰啲資產唔係錢啊！

656
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:33,960
外來嘅嘢深入嚟。

657
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:37,260
啊，副局長請你回答啊！唔該。

658
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:54,050
你咪判佢坐監，終身監禁，有死刑嘅冇問題啊！

659
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:29,850
會令到佢嗰邊嘅大笨象同埋眾議員被殺，我同意嘅。但係大家唔好混淆一層。

660
01:57:54,540 --> 01:58:01,210
我都唔支持，有好多象牙，同議員都唔支持嘅，大家都知㗎啦。但係問題，而家本身有嗰啲嘢，你點樣處理先？

661
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:11,610
今日你同佢講五年之後佢唔賣得，嗰啲產嗰啲嘅賬啊，嗰啲嘅資產，其實就會等於冇。

662
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:22,670
佢哋想講，可能你認為香港有啲非法嘅人士，佢賣緊一啲非法口嘅象牙。

663
01:56:54,660 --> 01:57:02,790
但係而家個問題，大家要介翻清楚，你唔好混淆佢先。我係講緊一啲以前你批牌畀佢，你講畀佢聽得嘅人。

664
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:31,730
七百幾噸嘢就冇曬啦，今日邊有得爭拗咧？個問題噉啊，政府嘅問題啊嘛，係咪？你當時候你哋唔解決清楚，今日你而家突然間講龍門，咁嗰啲人點啊？三百幾人唔使理佢啊！

665
01:56:30,130 --> 01:56:49,430
兩班人，你唔好將一啲合法嘅人同埋啲非法嘅人撈埋一齊。我今日企喺度，我講咁多嘢，我咁多次會主席，我係幫緊啲合法喺香港政府發牌畀佢做緊嘅合法商人，唔係一啲非法嘅人，唔係一啲非法入口、非法去獵殺嗰啲人，我唔支持嘅。

666
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:57,170
我哋再畀多五年嘅時候咧，其實咧，我哋見到好大部分咧，都會係正常地退休嘅。咁所以，我哋覺得可能會係一個更加好嘅安排。具體一啲嘅話咧，我請我同事睇下有冇啲補充。係啊，郭郭女士，多謝主席，多謝陳議員嚇嗰個發問。其實都誒，頭先我哋副局長都講咗，就係我哋其實都非常之關心。

667
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:17,180
即係一啲即係象牙嗰個，尤其雕刻工咧，佢哋從業員啦，佢哋即係之後嗰個情況會係點？咁其實呢度咧就啊，漁護署嗰方面咧，其實一直都同佢哋咧就係探討緊。咁其實咧有關一啲嘅同佢哋嘅之間個溝通啦，同埋調查咧，而家都係度正喺度做緊嘅。咁初步嚟講咧，就係誒有一啲咧都希望咧會有啲即係。

668
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:37,190
即係誒，即係嗰個事業同埋嗰個技術上一個轉型或者再培訓，但係當然大家都明白呢個未必係適合到每一位嘅醬油從業員，所以喺呢一度咧，我哋都係同佢哋喺度探討緊一啲誒唔同可以幫助到佢哋之後嗰個嘅誒情況嘅嘅誒嘅一啲嘅辦法。咁呢一度我哋係進行緊嘅嚇。

669
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:58,220
好，誒下一位第二輪，啊邵家輝議員，你有四分鐘時間，邵家輝。啊唔該，主席。嗱，首先第一，我想澄清翻頭先啊，即係郭培凡議員所講，即係非洲嗰啲大笨象獵殺同我哋有咩關係噉樣？即係嗱，我頭先上一次我講得好清楚，我對於嗰啲大笨象同埋嗰啲嘅保護員佢被獵殺，我非常之同情。

670
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:31,900
你政府用咩方法去解救佢先？你睇，一路講緊啊，幫佢哋轉型。嗰啲象牙工其實咁多年，大部分都全部都年紀好大㗎啦。頭先葉葉太都講咗啦，根本就唔係講緊轉型嗰個問題，係講緊佢啲資產。你都講畀佢聽，佢係值錢嘅。佢嗰陣時投放啲錢擺咗落去，而嗰啲會唔會令到更加多？

671
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:54,540
我阿阿阿局長，你哋有記錄㗎嘛？我頭先咪講咗咯，你有記錄㗎嘛？噉佢其他啲入嚟嘅話，嗰啲咪即係非法嘅咯。你即刻拉得㗎啦，過嚟揾你係咪？你點可以將佢撈埋一提，又將佢混淆咧？係咪？香港市民要好清楚講清楚今次嘅故事。我哋唔係支持繼續獵殺大笨象，我都唔支持貿易啦。

672
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:21,780
你之前喺一九九零年嘅時候，你講畀我聽，喂，其實已經冇進出口象牙，其實全香港好多人都以為唔可以。原來嗰啲頭先阿陳振斌已經講咗啦，係咪一九七五年、一九七六年嗰啲，其實公約前嗰啲繼續畀佢賣賣，都唔知有幾多入咗嚟。所以點解賣嚟賣都賣唔曬啊？嘛，你一早你禁埋嗰條線嘅話，咁咪冇咯。個。

673
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,100
咧都係再出樓做。

674
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:04,030
係副局長，唔該。

675
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:02,320
即係，如果真係需要誒轉型嘅話，

676
01:59:56,450 --> 02:00:04,480
而家咪提出嚟嘅，冇錯係去到一嘅地步，我哋需要落閘，需要咧就做一個全面嘅禁止啦，噉樣嘅。好，下一位阿郭佩凡議員。

677
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:59,170
唔成立啦，係咪？咁誒第二咧，就係我都關心嗰啲誒誒，可能啲工匠啊，或者誒誒，即係誒從業員嘅噉。咁政府而家嘅睇法就係誒話點樣可以幫到佢哋咧？

678
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:35,180
喺一路咪冇咯，就係咁簡單。嗰度嗰條數大到都冇人知嘅。點解香港其實變咗個貿易港？其實就係嗰個問題。你當年你冇禁埋嗰個工作前嗰啲，你唔好畀佢嚟啊嘛。咁咪冇問題咯。咁而家嗰啲已經嚟咗，你畀曬牌，佢點樣解決先？

679
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:59,660
議員，主席，我都好明白你嗰個嘅觀點，但係咧喺度咧，我真係要再重申一點，就係話咧，我哋咁全面咁啲障牙咧，唔係我哋今日提出嚟嘅一樣嘢，係正如你都講咯，二十七年，如果我哋禁咗嘅入咗二十七年前，我哋禁咗，可能冇今日問題咧，係嘛？所以我哋係畀多咗好多嘅時間，係等嗰個行業慢慢咧係去。主席，每。

680
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:19,670
阿局長，我講清楚，你廿七年前我叫你禁咗，唔好畀佢入口啊！你廿七年前你畀嗰啲其他嗰啲咩工業前嗰啲入口嘅話，佢咪冇貨係咁滲入嚟咯？一萬三千幾件，你都計唔到重量嗰度有幾多，我都唔知你嗰啲有冇影相添？點解香港賣嚟賣去賣唔到有咁多？就係有嗰啲入嚟啊嘛！你嗰陣時一界界咗七百幾噸，全部影晒，佢唔係一路吸。

681
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:56,450
副局長係啊，多謝啊，議員你澄清。但係我都再重申一點，就係話咧嚇咁全面咁啲障眼眼咧，唔係今日新鮮提出嚟嘅一件事，係已經咧係有一段好長嘅時間咧，係畀業界咧去去預備，甚至協助從業員啊，佢哋再就業、再培訓咧，係二十七年前已經開始做嘅一個嘅工作，唔係今。

682
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:24,770
係誒，多謝主席。我都係想繼續問翻我頭先問緊嘅問題咧。第一就係今日好多嘅爭拗都係講緊點解你哋畀啊啲即係pre-convention啦，即係公約前嘅賬額入咗。咁但係誒，照我所知，入口一批批入就你哋有記錄啦，出口又有記錄㗎嘛，公約前嗰啲。咁所以我就想話，究竟有幾多留喺香港？

683
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:44,780
係咪因為入留喺好多好多留喺香港，所以導致導致誒，即係啲醬油賣唔曬咧？咁但係話賣唔曬都剩翻百分之十啫。咁噉，我覺得政府係咪有個有個即係full picture可以話翻畀大家聽，究竟係咩一回事咧？好過萬位喺度口同鼻咬，我都唔知喺度咬緊乜嘢而家。可唔可以答咗我呢個問？

684
02:00:44,780 --> 02:01:04,790
可唔可以答啊？呢個問題，阿阿陳生入同埋出嗰個數量係幾多？同埋即係剩翻香港幾多咧？究竟咁多年間？誒，多謝主席。咁誒，我頭頭先我都講過，其實咧喺九零年國際禁後之後咧，即係嗰個供弱前漲行咧，就我哋入口咧就有十三點九噸加一萬九千七。

685
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:24,800
百件，但係同時期咧出咗口嘅咧就係十點九噸加三百八十件。即係如果我哋唔計件數嗰啲先咧，就基本上咧有超過八成咧就再出口咗，唔係留喺香港。至於嗰啲一件件嘅象牙嘅製品咧，其實留喺度香港咧，我哋記錄係三百八十件嘅，即係大部分。

686
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:46,420
係，唔該曬啊，高煇華議員有冇跟進啊？嗱，咁頭先點解唔早啲將呢啲數字講出嚟？咁咪大家比較明白啲咯。咁即係話一路喺度拗緊，就係話誒啊，你哋又畀咁多工作錢嘅入嚟，於是乎搞到佢哋嗰啲賣唔曬，咁而家淨翻喺度，所以你要賠償。咁如果淨翻三百八十件，大部分都已經出咗口嘅，咁即係話呢一個嘅説法根本。

687
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,840
喂，呢個係兩回事嚟㗎。

688
02:03:23,290 --> 02:03:25,860
誒，但係我哋要睇清楚個問題。

689
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:45,910
最主要原因就係因為我哋個門口守得唔夠好。

690
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:38,200
唔喺呢一方面做多啲，而杜絕嗰個殺戮。所以咧，我哋其實我係非常之反對。

691
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:11,330
但係我哋守住門口嘅嗰班官員咧，佢哋就話唔係喎，我睇嗰張證書㗎咋，嗰張證書係噉就係噉啊。咁其實我哋要睇下而家個問題係兩部分。

692
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:59,340
就係喺公約後有啲料係充斥住，但係公約前啊嘛，然之後就如木混珠地入到嚟香港，透過轉口去其他地方。

693
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:51,910
獵殺大笨象，但係當然啦，我嘅講法可能會話部分環保團體就可能會扭曲啦。誒，你可能會話要去啊，即係畀特惠津貼嗰班象牙持牌人。

694
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:40,050
我哋禁止咗象牙貿易啊，即係新料公約後咧，其實基本上係唔可能再有殺戮嘅。但係點解仲有殺戮咧？點解嗰只象媽媽仲畀人殺咗？

695
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:22,980
好，唔該，阿陳恆鑌議員，唔該，係多謝主席。頭先咧，誒幾位小朋友所講嘅誒，即係幾個問題，包括誒帶咗誒誒像B B啊嚟到現場嘅咧，都令我好感動。

696
02:04:51,640 --> 02:05:09,610
止咗啊！不過係原料而唔係製成品嘛。製成品佢哋七月一號之後繼續賣緊嘅喎，可以繼續入口嚟香港嘅喎。如果我哋呢個門口唔閂嘅話，咁點解我哋今時今日去討論係咪對錯曬焦點咧？我哋係咪應該閂咗呢個門口先咧？

697
02:02:46,520 --> 02:03:05,370
好多都係接近啲誒退休嘅年齡啦，噉樣噉，所以我哋呢一度咧都係同佢哋傾緊。咁如果佢哋需要一啲唔同嘅再誒比較後生一啲需要啲唔同嘅再培訓嘅，我哋都會同有關嘅機構咧去研究咧有啲邊啲嘅再培訓課程。而另外啲需要咧，我哋都會繼續同佢哋探討嘅。唔該曬。

698
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:26,510
誒或者我聽我同事喺方面開始介紹啦。阿阿阿郭太唔該你嚇，係誒多謝曬嘅提問嚇。正如我哋頭先都即係強調，我哋都好關心即係從業員嗰方面。咁誒，我哋其實都同佢哋漁護署各方面都一直有啲調查啦，同我哋都傾緊，睇下點樣嘅方法咧能夠係幫助到佢哋。咁但係正如頭先亦都大家。

699
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:46,520
都有提出啦，就係話其實喺過去咁多年，其實有好多咧，佢哋都唔係淨係以雕刻象牙為呢一個嘅主要嗰個嘅誒營生嗰個方法。咁所以其實咧，已經好多已經喺過去咁多年已經轉咗型。咁剩翻好多咧，我哋都睇緊咧，就係點樣能夠最誒最幫到佢哋。咁誒亦都有好。

700
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:31,630
第一部分咧就係一直以嚟啊未簽公約前嗰批料喺香港嗰啲，其實已經有曬印記㗎啦。嗰啲料咧就係唔係今時今日，亦都唔係嗰只象媽媽啊被殺近代被殺嘅嗰啲象牙，而係一直以嚟都喺香港存在。

701
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:51,640
流傳喺市面上面，佢哋等緊賣緊出去嘅。但係你一批咧，就係可能近代不斷咁殺，包括郭佩凡議員去非洲影到嗰啲大笨象嘅屍體，嗰啲象牙去咗邊度咧？我淨係見到喺歐洲啊，包括政府所交畀我嘅文件，佢話係啊，佢哋禁止。

702
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:30,140
若果政府肯而家所有入口啊，證我都唔睇啦啊，總言之，我唔畀你入嚟。你入嚟咧，唔該你遞交曬一二三四五六七八種form啊，有埋carbon dating啊，我指定嘅lab你去做咗之後，你先話畀我聽你入口啦。其實我哋係可以噉樣去保護大笨象㗎嘛？點解我哋唔？

703
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:15,650
張亞工匠涉係人咧，佢哋喺香港裏面做緊嘅工作，呢個係我哋香港份內嘅事。我哋要諗下佢哋嘅財產點樣得到保護，呢個係香港基本法畀佢哋權利。但係我哋防止世界上面有殺戮呢一個問題，我哋亦都要關注。噉係咪從今日開始，我哋就停止歐洲料入口？

704
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:35,660
甚至乎要求佢，我哋加強要求佢哋交多啲材料畀我哋，證實嗰件料真係公約前嘅料咧。我哋可唔可以咁做咧，官員？係邊位可以答到啊？阿陳生，你答啊？唔該，唔該，主席。咁咧就誒，好同意頭先啊陳恆斌議員咧講嗰個問題。其實咧就正正咧係我哋。

705
02:07:55,700 --> 02:08:05,050
點四十五分，咁如果冇其他事項咧，我就宣佈而家係係散會啊！咁再一次係多謝與會嘅各位啊人士，唔該曬。

706
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:55,670
今次修改法例咧，我哋第二步咧就係即時咧喺嗰個誒法例實施之之後三個月咧，我哋正正就係禁止呢個工業前醬油嘅進口同埋再出口嘅。噉就呢個真係咧係將所有呢啲工業前醬油都係唔準再進出口㗎啦。其實咧，你係可以唔

707
02:06:55,670 --> 02:07:15,680
唔需要等個等個條例啊！你聽日你宣佈一個行政命令，已經可以即刻做到，亦都唔需要再有障礙入嚟。好多謝你嘅意見嗱。誒，我諗今日都即係多謝曬各位。今日喺誒即係九月呢一個時間咧，嚟到呢一個嘅誒公聽會，亦都非常之多謝誒咁多。

708
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:35,690
多位嘅團體同埋人士嚟到呢度畀啊好多嘅意見，包括喺啊外地嚟到香港啊畀意見嘅朋友，亦都多謝誒政府官員，亦都好多謝呢個委員會嘅各位誒委員喺呢個休會期間咧係係啊作出呢個努力，噉我都好希望啊呢個。

709
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:55,700
條例係可以係盡快可以係誒誒進行呢個繼續審議嘅。咁下一次我哋呢一個條誒草案委員會開會日期咧，我想講一講就係喺十月嘅十七號星期二，十月十七號星期二嘅上晝十點四十五分，十月十七號星期二上實。
