1
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,080
因為。

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,930
多謝主席。

3
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,110
咁所以。

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,270
許志峯議員。

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,000
雨傘運動佢今一年。

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,580
對新一屆嘅政府、下一任特首嘅期望。

7
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,950
呢篇宣言個主題係越打壓，我們越堅強。

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,580
呢個政府唔係代表人民，佢冇噉嘅政治能量。

9
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,830
其實民主派冇曬位置㗎啦，所以希望民主派員謹記呢一點。多謝。

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,110
撤回八三一、重啟政改、落實公民提名等等嘅訴求，仍未達成。

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,780
冇辦法將一啲好大嘅施政理念去落實，冇辦法喺社會上面凝聚一啲共識。

12
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:17,570
跟住落嚟，我希望我會喺度讀出一段咧，係雨傘運動一週年嘅時候，係公民社會發出嘅宣言。

13
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:55,670
人大八三一僭建基本法政改三人喺談判桌上對學生對港人嘅承諾仲未兑現。

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:28,910
畀政府知道呢一場民主運動咧係會延續落去，即係日咪有民主普選咧，我哋依然會喺社區上面見到黃色嘅雨傘。

15
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:28,100
頭先好多議員都講到好多施政同埋民生嘅問題，但係我哋要面對一個現實，就係我哋任何嘅政府喺冇民主嘅機制底下，我哋都冇辦法做到有效嘅管治。

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:01:07,680
我希望佢仲記得呢一場雨傘運動。我希望佢仲睇到人民喺社區喺社會裏邊嘅抗爭。我希望佢仲記得雨傘運動對政府對政權發出強烈嘅警號。

17
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,930
雖然真普選尚未實現。

18
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,910
卻面臨公民抗命嘅刑責。

19
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,230
大學針對學生組織日漸進逼。

20
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,690
任意演繹基本法，踐踏一國兩制。

21
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,900
雨傘運動期間嘅警暴問題咧，依然未解決。

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,530
否決之後，北京嘅言論逐漸激進。

23
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,840
但係行勢，公民權利以公民抗命回應不義政權嘅市民。

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,500
過去一年，香港同埋北京政府冇回應港人嘅民意。

25
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:26,050
但係經過九二八一夜嘅香港，已經翻唔到轉頭，我哋冇辦法壓忍。

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,150
當日數十萬嘅人民公民抗命嘅初衷，港人至今未忘。

27
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,480
建制派嘅反駁此起彼落，學術自主、校院校自主被受威脅。

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,900
政府放生違法執勤嘅警員，政府甚至係衝擊法治嘅元兇。

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,750
雖然主流民意反對基於八三一嘅政改方案，但係政府卻一意硬推。

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:37,040
我哋唔需要有悔念，因為爭取普選同埋平等嘅政治權利係每個公民嘅義務，何罪之有？

31
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:36,270
朱經緯案、任國測警等等，至今依然未得到係公道嘅司法程序，律政司遲遲未有回應。

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:15,880
七十九日嘅雨傘運動，帶畀香港社會嘅公民醒覺，一百幾十萬人嘅參與，造就咗回歸以嚟最大規模嘅政治運動。

33
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,090
一年過去。

34
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,430
麥美娟議員。

35
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,460
前路又如何咧？

36
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,530
我哋撐得住。

37
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,430
佔領雖然完結。

38
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,410
有志者散落社區。

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,130
但係，雨傘運動卻從未離開我哋。

40
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,130
準備由社區出發，重奪社區。

41
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,070
政權打壓依然，社會抗爭不斷。

42
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,760
呢個就係竹城雨傘運動嘅精神，呢個就係雨傘運動。

43
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,720
雨傘運動係所有追求民主嘅香港人最難忘嘅一頁。

44
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:53,780
雨傘運動被建制扭曲，相關嘅著作被禁受，真相被權力掩蓋。

45
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:50,460
我哋依然喺度，無論打壓有幾咁兇險，都敵唔過我哋嘅成長、堅持同埋互相嘅支持。

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:21,530
一年過去，雨傘運動帶嚟嘅醒覺，造就唔同嘅雨傘一族，新建立嘅團體融入公民社會。

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:39,160
無論係七警、護花林等等嘅受害者，佢哋冇放棄過每一個討回公道嘅途徑，絕不放過濫權。

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:14,920
我哋不忘初衷，一年將至，與我哋喺九二八嘅前夕當日嘅活動相聚，同埋鼓勵反思過去，迎接未來。

49
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,930
你提呢個動耳。

50
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,520
你真咪鬼咁傻啦！

51
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,550
你發覺聽翻啲？

52
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,210
結果我估中咗郭偉強。

53
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,390
噉你就唔使旨意傾到啲乜出嚟嘅。

54
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,200
點會有人同你？

55
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,450
批評呢個林鄭嚇，即係你咧未宣佈就已經講定先噉。

56
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,990
我帶你幾年，真係食飯多你幾年，就真係諗到。

57
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,270
正正經經傾對下任行政長官嘅期望啊！

58
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,000
但係佢提嘅時候咧，坦白講，我哋自己傾咧，都已經話咧。

59
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:06,740
緊係又唔知睇到抽啲咩水，又滲埋曬啲政治嗰啲嘢落去。

60
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:37,700
主席，嗯，阿郭偉強提呢個動議咧，我梗係要支持啦。噉啊，我哋同事嚟㗎嘛。

61
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:05,990
呢個就正正其實誒啊，郭偉強嘅動議裏邊講話，我哋嘅社會而家難以聚焦民生同埋經濟議題。

62
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,750
葉太又好似即係鬧得少啲噉，薯片叔叔更加唔會鬧啦，係嘛？咁所以咧，即係誒，所以呢個呢個動議其實變咗即係。

63
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:16,540
仲話期望下任嘅行政長官帶領香港走出政治爭拗嘅困局，即係唔好意思，潑冷水都要講，我係悲觀。

64
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:40,840
同時講咧，唔單止係即係唔講正經嘢啦，仲有咧就係而家變咗係誒林鄭批判大會。其實葉太應該高興嘅，因為噉我聽到啲人係多數鬧林鄭多啲咧。其實林鄭都未宣佈參選，但係都已經畀人咁鬧法噉啊！

65
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,630
大家。

66
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,670
大家覺得？

67
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,890
所以即係。

68
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,980
我對工聯會嘅期望。

69
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,120
有一個新嘅行政長官。

70
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,370
主要係咪好似佢哋講嗰啲要用佢哋嗰啲方法咧？

71
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,120
你睇到我哋今日或者尋日呢兩日同事嘅發言？

72
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,630
我想同你講朱愛迪，或者所有聽緊呢個辯論嘅市民。

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,140
佢哋就會唔鬧啦咩？佢哋就同你講聚焦民生經濟啦咩？

74
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,740
我哋喺九十年代開始已經提出我哋一個綜合退休保障嘅方案。

75
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,070
工聯會喺爭取一個完善嘅退休保障計劃嘅決心係清楚嘅。

76
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:41,350
我諗，我哋唯有誒，我哋自己都係做翻好自己，緊守崗位，做翻我哋自己啲工作。

77
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:59,710
你哋又有冇睇過我哋工聯會個方案？你哋可唔可以同我哋一齊支持我哋工聯會嘅方案？等我哋去一齊爭取咧！

78
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:45,890
所以呢一個亦都係我哋對下任行政長官嘅期望，就係一定要喺香港推行一個完善嘅退休保障計劃。

79
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:36,340
呢一點，我哋同大家一樣，我哋認為要有一個完善嘅退休保障計劃，先至能夠保障打工仔女嘅權益，先至能夠令到打工仔女過一個有尊嚴嘅晚年生活。

80
00:07:42,290 --> 00:08:02,300
不過你聽翻頭先，我我哋聽咗一陣，我就已經覺得唉嗱。尋日嗰啲，尋日當瞓醒覺唔記得啦。今朝嗰啲咧近啲講啊，譚文浩議員七分鐘嘅發言，我分幾鐘嚟抽工聯會水，跟住到朱海迪又係佢嘅發言。第一個唔係講對行政長官嘅期望。

81
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,630
周浩鼎言。

82
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,280
更加希望嘅就係而家，我哋好多香港市民面對嗰個住嘅問題。

83
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,130
especially on the need of the SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprise.

84
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:18,240
佢哋想發展佢哋嘅生意咧，都係有好多困難，令到我哋嘅經濟咧係唔能夠多元化嘅發展。

85
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:30,910
噉啊，講翻對下任行政長官嘅期望。頭先我講咗，我係固然希望我係爭取多年嘅退休保障計劃係能夠得以完善同埋落實。

86
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:51,570
Mr. President, many of our colleagues have talked about their wish list to the next chief executive. Today, I'm more focused on the future economy and growth of Hong Kong.

87
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:49,720
喺郭偉強嘅原動意裏邊咧，係有提到高地價政策令到地產獨大同埋物業炒賣成風，令租金過高窒礙經濟多元化發展。呢個我相信。

88
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:54,740
七三，即係百分之七十係公營房屋，百分之三十係私營房屋。有人話唔得嘅喎，你咁做呢個立場，你噉樣做呢個建議咧，私樓咧就會畀人以為咧唔使起啊。其實大家如果要諗下。

89
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:32,170
畀嚟做劏房，另外咧要就住一啲已經能夠合資格上樓嘅市民咧，提供一個租金津貼，同埋咧係七誒提出啊七一個物業嘅空置税。我哋希望三管齊下方案咧係可以解決而家基層市民住屋嘅問題。多謝主席。

90
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:18,520
首先，朱海迪議員，我唔知佢係講錯定係乜啦。佢話咧，如果我哋啲泛民議員，我哋放棄咗嗰啲立場之後咧，咁民主派咧就冇位置㗎啦。噉係咪真係因為你哋驚冇定企，所以點都要走出嚟鬧咗先咧？

91
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:34,000
令到人哋覺得話話私樓啊，到時唔得㗎啦，到時會仲更加貴啊，因為你起咗個私樓會高啊，咁咪炒高佢咧。其實我哋有一個公營嘅房屋增加，解決基層市民住屋嘅問題，係令到可以全港我哋嘅樓價咧都係得以舒緩。

92
00:09:50,580 --> 00:10:10,590
除咗某啲商界嘅同事覺得炒賣冇乜所謂之外咧，其實其他同事都應該會同意呢一個高地價政策，令到樓價高企，令到我哋唔單止住嘅問題難以得到解決，連小嘅小本經營者佢。

93
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:38,840
其實工聯會咧已經有一個咧好清楚就住房屋嘅主張，就係希望公屋為主，居屋為輔，私人樓宇作補充。我哋建議將公營房屋嘅興建量增加到係每年三萬三千個，亦都要為未來建屋嘅公私型比例定為。

94
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,710
在granting necessary permissions。

95
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,680
那 was a painful lesson to learn.

96
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,030
for instance，the East Lantau project。

97
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,200
The authority should take active steps to tackle this problem.

98
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,640
The SMEs can't even start the business unless.

99
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,810
business owners end up with being bewildered on whether they should carry on.

100
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Removing all these unnecessary red tape is surely conducive to the business development.

101
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:47,240
In retrospect, Mr. President, some believe that Hong Kong needs to uphold the lesser fear principle. It's true.

102
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:57,210
That upholding the less fair principle is by no means an excuse for the government to be complacent.

103
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:39,290
I would expect whoever takes up the top job in the next government ought to carry on with this task.

104
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:04,840
another example is the daunting problem of hardship suffered by SMEs due to the failure of opening bank accounts.

105
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:27,720
前提係，The Currency Y Loans Administration has indeed made a lot of breakthrough in boosting the land supply, especially in the long run.

106
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:13,300
Government must take initiative to get around problems when necessary. We recall that Donald Trump's administration had hoarded the housing supply for many years, which caused dire consequence to the city.

107
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:15,080
而家如果我哋喺私人市場裏邊有好多基層市民，就係因為上唔到樓，佢哋要住劏房。其實，如果能夠令到公營嘅比例建屋比例係增加，令到更多嘅居民能夠盡快上樓嘅話，又點會？

108
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:54,970
另外咧，就係我哋認為喺誒，我哋而家面對一啲夾心階層，特別係一啲誒佢哋誒而家又要排緊公屋，又未能夠真正上樓嘅時候咧，噉佢哋係應該頭先我講，佢哋好多住緊劏房劏房嗰個價錢咧，簡直係超。

109
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:14,980
超高嘅，而且咧係脱離我哋而家香港社會嘅現實，所以我哋工聯會提出一個三管齊下方案，包括租務管制係限住特別咧係針對而家喺一啲差英鎊差享租值六萬蚊以下嘅誒立舊特別係舊樓，因為嗰啲樓咧多數係做。

110
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:17,620
As we know, the SMEs is the pillar of our economy. I wish the next chief executive would make effort to shore up their business by creating more business opportunity and a better business environment. One of the essential requirement for SMEs is the land supply for business.

111
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:38,180
紅tape是另一個障礙 for business development。我 recall that some small and medium size enterprise in the course of launching their new business encounter difficulties caused by the government authority, including their ambiguous response from the authority.

112
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,750
先嚟幾米。

113
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,460
Thank you, Mr. President.

114
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,760
Unfortunately.

115
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,150
但係，我 assert。

116
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,330
多謝。

117
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,220
That is what has been happening here.

118
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,420
They have their bank account successfully launched.

119
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,780
是this a responsible way to handle our problem? I'm sure not.

120
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,890
They are against every single government's proposal over the past few years.

121
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,800
但當政府開始address啲 concern， by launching public housing development。

122
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,000
我讀了許多我的同事從反民主派來。

123
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,950
They simply just blasted the government about, for example, the long-existing housing problem.

124
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,260
last but not least， the pan democrats have simply become staunch opposition here.

125
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:03,030
In doing so, in the long run, that may be able to create business opportunities for these local SMEs. This is my advice to the next government.

126
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:50,800
They would object to these all of these policy initiatives, so the problem couldn't be solved, and they have a chance to blame the government again.

127
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:52,120
我認為政府可以採取措施，來鼓勵國際企業家從國家，特別是根據一帶一路政策，來訪香港未來。

128
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:37,700
Mr. President, it is interesting to note that many foreigners pay a visit to Hong Kong for business purposes, including attending trade fair, business conference. For SMEs engaged in export business, this is important opportunity for them.

129
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,390
and this brave.

130
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,540
一 Mission of Truth。

131
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,340
with integrity.

132
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,400
領導應該有 courage。

133
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,900
領導應該有清晰的使命。

134
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,870
According to the Taoist principle.

135
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,320
和 integrity for the good of the people.

136
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,600
being soft on the outside and firm on the inside.

137
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,970
一個好領導應該發揚愛和忠誠。

138
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,230
The mission or endeavour itself should be.

139
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,790
and clearly communicate that mission and carry it out.

140
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,130
哀悼，when you have to； praise when you can。

141
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:03,420
those who rule by fear and manipulation and control and exploitation.

142
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,910
When they have a chance, look out for your people, but be fair, like that of Thakin.

143
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:13,220
may have gained in the short term, but when it really come, counts his people will abandon him.

144
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,140
Mr. President.

145
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,220
which is known as the eight beatitudes.

146
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,540
這個approach have proved entirely wrong.

147
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,460
rather than something attainable in the near future.

148
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,610
當領袖，According to Jesus Christ in His Sermon of the Mount。

149
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,490
and Lam Cheng being a good Catholic, and so is John, and so are the others.

150
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,990
在在面，對危機，一位領袖站上台，他就是。

151
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:52,810
the go to the to the guy. He is he stand up for others and protect others. He is well.

152
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:13,290
經濟和政治 turmoil，自移交以來，穩定、繁榮和社會和諧，似乎已經成為 nostalgia for the past。

153
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:21,120
我給他們這聲明：， blessed are the meek， for they shall possess the land。 rule with meekness， rule with humility， and that is what makes a good leader。

154
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:08,880
housing for the needy. Look at our waiting list from from from the start of the SAR to now, we have over 29,000 waiting to be housed.

155
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:26,130
Mr. Mr. President, before I speak, I like to quote from the man of wisdom, Lao Tzu, and from Jesus Christ in the Sermon of the Mount. According to the Taoist principle, what makes a good leader?

156
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:54,430
For example, a deep-seated problem in Hong Kong, the SAR government have been on the wrong track of indulging itself in general obsession with home ownership that it consider right, rather than providing.

157
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:42,410
irrespective who is going to be our next E. A meaningful question that Hong Kong people may wish to to be answered is, who will bring the desired changes and lead Hong Kong out of the economic stomach and endless political disputes.

158
00:19:42,720 --> 00:20:02,730
After all, from Dong's leadership to Donald's junks and CY Leung's, Hong Kong people have run the government from optimistic and confident to pessimistic and sceptical about one country, two system, and Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. After two decades of social economic

159
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:37,810
Mr. Mr. President, I cannot agree more that the next year must bring Hong Kong back to the track of prosperity, stability and social harmony. But what is the right track? This is the question our government leaders have failed to answer adequately. Take housing.

160
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:33,820
The next C must refrain from this obsession, and his or her housing policy needs to focus on timely provision of public housing units to the needy, and do let the private sector do the rest. To this end, the next C should among things, other things, abolish the counterproductive.

161
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,410
主席。

162
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,950
海軍而言。

163
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,680
都要做嘅，多謝主席。

164
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,780
誒誒誒。

165
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,850
仲有邊位延伸發展？

166
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,540
特首候選人嘅。

167
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,000
喺三年三年前，當大。

168
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,290
仲談到特首選舉中。

169
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,130
for nurturing our human capitals, in particular, expanding the subsidised spaces.

170
00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:06,600
是 to be built on an equitable society, which with its wealth shared by the community as a whole. To turn this vision into reality, the next E must increase investment in education.

171
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:27,360
Each year to admit more eligible students to the undergrad programme. I have a list here which I cannot read it out because of time element.主席，最後我希望畀八個字未來個特首。

172
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:30,920
但他或她必須守線，如果任何，基於主要尊重我們的核心價值，例如市場自由和法治，提供一個商業友好的環境和一個平等的競賽場，最低限度的政府幹預和。

173
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:52,400
高land price policy，example，excessive high premium for land modification application，and the excessive market interventions like the like，due to unleash the dynamic of market，facilitate better and more transparent and more water tight planning of using scarce land。

174
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:12,690
resources for meeting our housing and development needs. Reduce bureaucratic red tapes in town planning board, building department, lands department and the URA that have been holding back redevelopment. Mr. President, the next CEO needs not blindly toe the policy line laid down by the previous CEO.

175
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:53,070
Pressures, there have been proven elements. These have been proven elements for having successfully make Hong Kong transform into an international financial centre. Don't spoil it, setting up us apart from our regional counterparts and competition. The ultimate goal of economic success is.

176
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:48,210
佢係邊個都唔重要。依八個字係用人之道，係唔好咁計較啦。係用人之道揾啲好啲嘅人幫佢。依八個字，邊個特首都應該要有嘅。頭先我喺老子同埋喺耶穌嘅教訓嗰度咧，依八個字就係所有佢哋需。

177
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,350
有人問。

178
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,730
當其時。

179
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,230
基本法裏邊寫。

180
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,850
同大家分享。

181
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,900
眾議紛紛。

182
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,500
其中嘅條件係乜嘢？

183
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,360
同埋領土領土嘅完整。

184
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,050
所以我哋先收回香港。

185
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,250
有提到係愛國愛港。

186
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,880
為咗維護國家嘅統一。

187
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,190
如何去量化愛國愛港？

188
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,600
其後，我喺香港電台一個節目裏邊。

189
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,060
再要加上保持香港嘅穩定同埋繁榮。

190
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,920
要送幾多朵玫瑰花先至可以達到標準？

191
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:56,270
愛國愛港嘅定義，實際上就已經喺基本法嘅序言有所敍述。

192
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,110
我哋。

193
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,140
鎮痛式。

194
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,500
言論自由。

195
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,100
有人用一種。

196
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,130
政府嘅領導人。

197
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,060
外港就需要去。

198
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,660
咩叫做愛港？

199
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,470
係話要搞港獨。

200
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,190
可以有唔同嘅意見。

201
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,730
特首為一個。

202
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,220
保持香港繁榮同埋穩定。

203
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:37,460
亦都係特別列出咗香港呢個特區嘅管治架構，以

204
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,050
唔單止香港喺家庭裏邊都有唔同意見，呢個就係我哋嘅民主進程、自由表達。

205
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:06,040
噉樣就係違背咗基本法同埋祖國收回香港主權嘅嗰個原意。

206
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:53,710
所以，愛國嘅定義係不能夠容許中國嘅領土唔完整，包括任何企圖宣揚。

207
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,770
但係。

208
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,190
治國理念。

209
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,840
或者手術式。

210
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,610
係影響香港嘅穩定。

211
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,490
亦都係純粹口上。

212
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,970
不能夠忘記初衷，就係。

213
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,970
係咪愛港啊？唔談愛國字先。

214
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,530
口甜舌滑，去誤導羣眾。

215
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,930
上間間言呢個危精。

216
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,220
進得唔得咧？絕對不能。呢個就係談到佔中嘅問題。

217
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,900
要做出好多舉措，但係佢哋係慷他人之慨。

218
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,820
所以佔中係咪一個愛國愛港嘅舉措咧？

219
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:49,800
有好多人講嘅説話，美其名係為民主，為美其名係為香港。

220
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:29,490
亦都係喺噉嘅基礎同埋前提下，定定咗我哋呢個基本法，可以話千錘百煉，而當中裏邊。

221
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:45,300
但係喺個大前提下邊，我哋都係要愛護香港，做任何嘢，講任何説話，都係要保持香港嘅穩定同埋繁榮。

222
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:10,580
可以講啲好尖鋭嘅説話嚟勸告佢嘅皇上，應該要走上係咩為之叫做歷精圖治啊嘅嗰個策略。

223
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,910
市民。

224
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,320
特首。

225
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,210
搞停佢！

226
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,700
我就必須要。

227
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,590
但係，當面對到困難。

228
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,940
必須要勇敢、果斷。

229
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,980
寫得清晰不過。

230
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,040
係要依從基本法辦事。

231
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,460
翻嚟對特首點睇法？

232
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,280
呢種係唔愛港嘅行為。

233
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,000
中環係香港嘅經濟嘅中心。

234
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,630
哪怕前面係充滿挑戰。

235
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,760
既然係要有呢個條件，愛國愛港。

236
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,240
種種言論喺和平佔中裏邊呢本書。

237
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,290
令到中央有付出沉重嘅代價。

238
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,500
要做一個威權嘅政府，並唔係威逼。

239
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:28,270
影響香港嘅繁榮，因為當其時話，倘若我哋唔爭取到呢一個一人一票選到特首嘅時候，我哋一定要將香港嘅經濟。

240
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,540
唯一政府。

241
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,770
香港向來係。

242
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,990
好多好多嘅。

243
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,670
依法治港。

244
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,430
對今屆政府，我表示失望嘅。

245
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,900
大家視法律如無物。

246
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,810
發展影響咗我哋香港。

247
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,360
附設嘅損害性嘅。

248
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,510
就喺呢個問題上邊，引申到咧。

249
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,290
所以，主觀嘅思想再加上客觀嘅。

250
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,760
喺噉嘅情況下，你點能夠去管治香港咧？

251
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,480
但係喺呢個公開嘅場合，我再次批評。

252
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,330
佢係唔能夠依法嚟去處理佔中。

253
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:39,070
我哋係咪需要絕對貧困主義？要諗清楚，公平唔等於貧困。我哋唔需要極端民主化。

254
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:50,480
我哋亦都唔需要去盲從附和，但係既然一有個協議，眾人嘅意見定咗，必須就要去落實執行。

255
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,950
多謝主席。

256
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,820
陳志全議員。

257
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,940
如果冇，

258
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,360
做邊位嘢想法？

259
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,280
今日嘅辯論題目係對下任行政長官嘅期望。

260
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,750
其實香港市民咧，對於下一任、再下一任。

261
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:29,110
而造成以上問題嘅特首，亦都往往係得到工聯會提名，毫無保留咁去支持。

262
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:04,230
論證經過討論之後，我哋必須要果斷執行呢個對我哋未來嘅特首嘅期望。多謝主席。

263
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:20,250
郭議員提出嘅問題，正正就係由於小圈子選舉產生，唔將香港人利益放喺首位嘅特首造成。

264
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:39,270
所以工聯會今日提出呢個動議辯論，有人就覺得諷刺，我就諗住佢係咪向梁振英追訴咧？啊，定係慚愧咧？

265
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:29,090
如果北京繼續不斷強調一國重於兩制，不斷加緊對香港嘅操控，不斷歇斯底里咁去摧毀香港嘅核心價值，

266
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:26,950
但係工聯會就被指為咧係最乖嘅建制派，隨時叫佢投A就投A，投B就投B，毫無保留噉樣咧。

267
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:28,400
所以我哋要不忘初衷，繼續前進，要去做，要做乜嘢咧？要糾正翻而家我哋喺香港裏邊有幾個錯誤思想、思想誤區。

268
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:09,430
郭偉強議員提出嘅議案裏邊提到啦，高地價政策促成地產業獨大及物業炒賣成風，令租金過高。政府欠缺改善勞工權益嘅決心，無法扭轉強資本弱勞工嘅局面。

269
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:56,380
好記得上一屆最後一次誒答問大會，郭偉強議員咧路襲六八九嗰個政綱嗰一幕咧，好多市民記憶猶新。即係有啲市民話：阿郭議員即係高票當選咧，都係嗰一幕都係攞分唔少嘅。

270
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:51,970
任何一個行政長官咧，都唔應該有啲咩期望，最多都係望北京，只會陰唔好陰點一個比梁振英更強硬、更卑鄙、用更粗暴手段破壞香港核心價值嘅人。

271
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:15,930
其實過去三任特首都係由財團同埋中央操控嘅社團組織嘅小圈子產生，佢哋嘅政策傾向財團。即使受到工聯會支持嘅梁振英，都冇真心意欲去訂立呢個標準工時。

272
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:37,450
本身嘅咩位置要做翻稱職嘅工作，不能夠越追而待炮。皇帝唔聽你嘅説話嘅時候，你攞把刀去行殺佢得唔得咧？你可唔可以脅迫佢得唔得咧？你可唔可以話：如果我哋唔係咁做嘅時候，我要同你同歸於？

273
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,780
係。

274
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,480
去支持。

275
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,340
其實。

276
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,500
我希望。

277
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,260
即係話啊，點解？

278
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,090
毫無寸進啊！可以話講咗就當做咗。

279
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,400
即係工聯會嘅同事咧，係要好好咁去反省。

280
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:47,220
我查翻記錄，喺二零一二年咧四月廿五號，詹培忠議員曾經提出向第四任行政長官提出建議嘅動議。

281
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:01,740
睇到以梁振英為首，有呢個社團背景嘅所謂愛國團夥喺機場胡亂襲擊香港市民，甚至係記者。

282
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:11,400
即係大部分都係冇發生嘅，除咗係處理長者交通費用同埋檢討鼓勵就業交通津貼計劃呢個咧，叫做真係落實咧，其實。

283
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:51,400
即係呢個政改甩碌八幾廿八呢啲噉嘅醜事，我唔提你就唔好提啦，自己衰咗就講少句啦，啊，仲要攞出嚟。

284
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:59,970
工聯會嘅葉偉明當時提出咗修訂，提出咗十四項期望。呢十四項期望咧，今日啊，郭偉強議員都冇冇逐個講翻嘅。其實呢十四項期望裏邊咧，

285
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:30,380
北京唔畀梁振英入閘咧，佢哋選舉嘅時候幾經辛苦，諗盡計謀去擋嗰啲選舉論壇啲問題，支唔支持梁振英啊？都唔敢大大聲聲話唔支持，嚇寧願冒住失少少選票嘅危險。

286
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:39,150
今日李慧瓊議員咧就提出修正案啦，我不得不咧花少少時間咧係回應下佢呢個修正案，因為真係好好離奇嘅嗱。佢開頭就加咗句，佢話今年香港將舉行行政長官換屆選舉，為行政長官普選方案被否決，令本港民主進程受挫。

287
00:34:52,420 --> 00:35:12,430
另外，我睇到佢加落去嗰啲詞語咧，其實大部分都冇乜爭議性。啊，可能佢係唔嫌阿郭偉強嗰個動意唔夠左嚇，唔夠紅啦，就加咗句誒掌握一帶一路帶來嘅機遇。噉我唔知我可唔可以噉係理解啦？其實佢哋都係幾都仍然係支持梁振英嘅。

288
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:51,940
繼續嚇，佢希望未來嘅行政長官咧係掌握一帶一路帶嚟嘅機遇啊！李偉瓊一開始話咧，佢話港獨用自決包裝，並演變成暴力行動。喂，我又未見過自決派有咩暴力行為，反而調翻轉咧，我就。

289
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,840
真係肯定。

290
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,940
不少人認為。

291
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,230
李慧瓊話：促成社會大和解係大家嘅期望。

292
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:33,910
咁但係，李議員，你有冇講而家香港嘅撕裂，梁振英係有幾大嘅角色嘅咧？

293
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:02,040
梁振英唔競逐連任，同埋北京撤換咗啲港澳主要官員。

294
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:09,430
係表示中央要改變梁振英嘅強硬路線，而家大家都仲喺度猜猜度度。

295
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:09,930
當然啦，李慧瓊議員就唔會譴責呢啲以愛國為名嘅和港呢個團夥啦。

296
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:18,710
好多市民亦都覺得，其實可能中央只係切換咗一個有野心、做好多小動作、人緣差嘅政治投機分子。

297
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:20,770
而未來嘅特首會唔會都係繼續用呢啲噉嘅團夥嚟對香港嚟對意見聲音係進行白色恐怖嘅管治咧？

298
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:59,770
佢哋識得批評現屆政府或現屆政府破壞廉潔，但係佢哋咧就唔批評大搖庭咧係大頭買票。佢哋批評梁振英嘅政績乏善可陳。

299
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:14,230
但係，對於現屆政府一啲民生嘅政策，佢哋照單全收，限奶令、樓市辣椒、一週一行、人人倡導計劃、長者兩蚊搭車，代咗好似冇咗噉嘅樣。

300
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:51,200
李慧瓊期望特首向假借民主破壞法治嘅行為説不，噉你又有冇同時期望特首向假借愛國之名破壞香港法治嘅人説不咧？

301
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:35,360
將會欽點另一個唯命是從、作風更強硬，但係又更能團結建制陣營嘅官僚做特首，延續、繼續、延續破壞香港嘅核心價值，將香港內地化作為治港策略。

302
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:45,690
多謝主席。主席，我哋今日講呢個係對於下屆行政長官嘅期望。我就聽咗好多議員嘅發言，特別係誒泛民議員嘅發言。我發覺佢哋嘅發言咧，仍然都係改唔到對人唔對事呢個噉樣嘅作風。

303
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:56,090
香港嘅政治制度均與內地城市接軌，中央就可以為所欲為。如果北京唔改變、加強操控香港嘅方針，特首仍然係由小圈子產生，無論邊個擔任特首，都會變成另一個梁振英，政策仍然會向財團同埋中。

304
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:17,310
中國政府傾斜，核心利益仍然會不斷侵蝕，香港人亦都難以重回主權移交前嘅美好時光。所以小圈子選舉有票嘅人，你哋投票之前都係要諗清諗楚。本人僅此陳詞。仲有冇其他言商發言？

305
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,830
頭先有議員批評。

306
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,870
又阻住呢個創科局嘅成立。

307
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,770
依一種議政嘅態度咧，叫做實事求是。

308
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,140
佢哋又話：香港嘅經濟好單一化，但係泛民嘅議員。

309
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:19,470
歷代嗰啲史官點樣去批評前朝嘅皇帝咧？

310
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:03,730
亦都有一個期望，就係希望佢哋多啲理性，多啲包容，少點歪理。

311
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:46,850
都希望咧，下一任嘅特首係可以檢討一下，然之後研究是否能夠繼續推行。

312
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:21,380
所有嘅責任都推落去特首裏面，更加唔應該將所有嘅政治問題推落中央嗰度。

313
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:30,620
如果話我哋而家行政同立法關係欠佳，其實行政同埋立法雙方面都係有一個責任。

314
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:13,490
主席，中國人以誒自古以嚟咧，都有一個優良嘅傳統嘅，就係講求公道。如果你睇下我哋嗰啲歷史書咧，

315
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:28,600
李慧瓊議員話：我哋要掌握一帶一路嘅經濟機遇。如果我哋唔掌握呢個機遇，我哋香港點樣發展咧？佢哋淨係識得話香港嘅發展係停滯。

316
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:57,950
佢哋批評中央政府破壞一國兩制，但係佢哋對於港獨嘅分子就百般包容。呢一個係乜嘢嘅邏輯咧？呢啲唔負責任嘅言論，其實對於香港嘅發展係冇好處。所以未講對特首嘅期望之前，其實我對泛民嘅議員。

317
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:39,770
當然係有鬧，亦都會有贊嘅。呢一個係一個態度嚟嘅，我哋應該學。而家政府做得好嘅地方，我哋當然係希望下一任嘅政府能夠延續落去。如果而家政府做緊一啲具爭議性嘅議題，我亦都。

318
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:12,650
而家好多市民對於我哋立法會嘅政治生態嘅觀感，就係覺得我哋乜嘢都係政治化，唔夠實事求是，唔係幫市民去解決問題。所以，我哋唔應該好似反對派噉樣樣，將所有社會嘅問題。

319
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,080
但係，我哋苦心自問。

320
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,090
香港人對特首嘅要求。

321
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,450
帶領我哋香港人走向一個更好嘅未來。

322
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,800
因為依個位置係要處理大量嘅矛盾。

323
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,380
以及讓各個新發展區全速上馬。

324
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:01,500
治理一個國家並唔容易，管治香港同樣困難。

325
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:01,730
特首能夠完善呢個住屋嘅階梯，畀我哋嘅年青人睇到希望。

326
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,740
以上就係我對新特首嘅期望。我相信反對派嘅同事亦都係會認同。

327
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:09,010
喺建屋嘅方面，應該採取一啲更加有效嘅方法，譬如話積極噉樣開拓一啲嘅中地啦。

328
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:31,900
如果換著你去做特首，你做唔做到我頭先上面所講嘅一啲嘅要求咧？

329
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:23,490
為咗減少發展嘅阻力，應該對受影響嘅居民畀合理嘅賠償，以及將保育同埋發展係融入喺。

330
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:15,340
立法會嘅功能係監察政府，唔係反對政府，係要是其是，非其非，因為只有噉樣樣，香港嘅管治先至能夠有所改善。

331
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:55,610
我睇到最近奧巴馬佢臨落任之前，佢做咗一個訪問，佢特別忠告佢嘅下任嘅繼承人特朗普，佢話唔好將美國當作一個家族嘅企業去經營。

332
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:51,300
做特首唔係一件容易做嘅事，比起泛民嘅議員，佢哋淨係識得鬧，係難做得多。特首要同時得到中央嘅信任，得到香港人嘅支持，要維護一國兩制，要包容香港嘅獨特性同埋多元性，要改善行政同埋立法嘅緊張關係。

333
00:41:51,300 --> 00:42:11,310
又要發揮香港固有嘅優勢，為香港嘅產業開拓新嘅機遇。特首唔能夠漠視商界嘅聲音，又要改善基層市民嘅生活。特首要搞好經濟，做好民生，要展現魄力，要畀我哋香港人能夠睇到希望，揾到方向。

334
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:35,960
中央對於下任特首嘅要求已經講得好清楚，係要愛國愛港、有管治能力、中央信任、香港人擁護。而我自己最希望下一任嘅特首能夠解決香港嘅房屋問題，特別係我哋年青人嘅住屋問題。我哋睇到上。

335
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:55,970
上屆政府、今屆政府都能夠提出一啲改善青年人住屋問題嘅一啲政策，譬如話青年宿舍、公屋盡快落成、增建公屋，依一啲咧都係講咗，但係個成效係有待改善，亦都要加強加快。我希望下一任嘅。

336
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,900
謝偉俊議員。

337
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,840
有冇其他現場反應？

338
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,910
非常之高。

339
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,970
如果冇嘅，郭偉強議員。

340
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,440
資深公務員會做嘅嘢。

341
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,830
希望呢個角度去睇我哋而家誒呢件事。

342
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,350
主席第二點咧，我講講咧就係話，希望未來嘅特首，你會真係有眼光。

343
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:25,180
溝通嘅時候咧，能夠真係做出一個出色嘅政治人應該有嘅誒條件、同埋方式、同埋態度。

344
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:53,030
大約集中精力興建房屋，依個唔係我個人嘅期望，我相信亦都係普羅市民嘅期望。主席本人謹此陳辭。

345
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:17,410
講得唔好聽啲係好女兩頭門嘅方式，佢處理中港兩地之間嘅一啲問題嘅話咧，恐怕呢個並非一個合適或者最誒能夠解決香港問題嘅一個特首。

346
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:44,010
活化當中要檢討而家發展局同埋房屋局分家嘅做法，畀兩個政策局都能夠更好噉樣去配合。主席，香港大部分嘅問題其實都係民生問題，亦都係土地房屋嘅問題。下一屆政府係要對症下。

347
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:33,330
其實呢個課題咧就當然七分鐘咧就絕對唔夠講嘅。亦都我希望咧誒開中名意咧，我哋作為評論下嘅特首或者一個願望嘅名單咧，只係希望作為一個評論員，等於唔識踢波人都可以評論足球，或者唔識拍電影嘅人都可以評論電影一樣。

348
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:57,240
主席，我誒剛才好多位同事咧，都絕大部分同事咧都講咗好多角度咧，睇我哋希望下一屆特首有新希望、新氣象。噉我亦都或者唔需要多講啊。反其嚟咧，我都同意特別講財產陳議員咧講得好詳細咧，就一個四平八穩嘅一個講法咧，就關於我哋特首或者香港市民嘅期望。

349
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:17,470
有幾點我想補充下咧，主席就係第一咧。我覺得我哋香港係需要一個真真正正嘅政治人，係超越咗一個誒一個能力或者一個政治誒或者係公務員，無論係幾資深嘅公務員都好咧，去到處理問題睇事物同埋。

350
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:45,470
誒，我留意到咧，就呢一方面咧，如果淨係話有經驗管治，或者覺得自己好打得，又或者係真係多年嘅超級或者資深公務員嘅經驗咧，都未必能夠駕馭到香港目前嘅複雜嘅政治形勢，特別咧係唔明白到香港一國兩制之。

351
00:46:45,470 --> 00:47:05,480
下嗰種複雜，包括係對於誒中國中央政府對於共產黨，對於好多我哋以往中港矛盾咧，唔能夠係充分理解、充分敏感，誒，甚至乎係有適當嘅時候咧，用一啲好嘅溝通方法，包括係。

352
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:39,140
咁呢一方面咧，我希望唔單止要有腦啦，要有口啦，亦都係誒，真係有時候講少句又好，即係唔好將話驚住中央唔中意，就會令到矛會尷尬啊，或者有啲政策咧係要一錘定音。呢啲冚棒都其實可能係唔係真係好有政治智慧嘅講法，可能只係一個高級。

353
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,010
決定。

354
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,260
誒。

355
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,360
Donald Trump做美國總統，呢個係事實。

356
00:47:54,850 --> 00:48:00,100
亦都會針對中國好多特別喺貿易方面嘅政策，呢個都係事實。

357
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:43,340
主席，另一第三點咧，我想講嘅就係一個特首，希望會有膽識，有啲破格嘅膽識。

358
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:49,900
又或者淨係香港嘅問題，而係真係充分發揮到香港喺國際上、喺中港、喺中美矛盾上一個好嘅橋樑、好嘅關係。

359
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:23,470
去偵察，有時咧就適當時候亦都唔匿喺一個海霧籬後邊咧，啲浪啲浪唔好咁大嘅地方咧，係可以休息一陣。咁呢個角色咧，我希望咧，我哋未來嘅特首咧會更加充分發揮到。

360
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:36,700
咁而亦都係明白到咧，有時我哋香港最重要咧都係講財啫，講錢啫。正如李嘉誠先生早咧講咧，即係有乜好多個喺外邊賺錢，香港派息啊噉。咁香港事實上可以做到呢一個角色咧，就更加好。

361
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:52,950
改完以前，咁呢方面咧，我希望咧就誒新嘅特首會有呢一種淡色，佢真係睇下政策係咪需要徹底地改變，包括地。剛才咧就多位同事都講地，當然係好重要，香港一個好大嘅問題。

362
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:19,370
誒當然我聽過，包括有我哋財政司司長認為養積金咁多年嘅政策咧，好難為一下要取消咗佢。但係唔好忘記咧，就即係而家我哋選到嘅特美國選咗出嚟嘅Donald Trump咧。

363
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:20,390
但係，正正香港以往咧不斷都係由於國際上對於中國各種嘅打壓、制裁，甚至係啊封閉性嘅政策，令到香港有一個更加好嘅發展機會。咁希望咧，香港連特首咧都明白到呢一個機遇咧，其實係未來幾年咧，當Donald Trump嘅美國政權。

364
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:40,400
咧會對無論用台灣牌又好，用香港牌又好嚟對付中國嘅時候咧，係適當地有高度視野咧，睇到香港嘅重要性，對於國家嘅一個突破，對於香港作為一個中間遊走角色嘅重要性喺呢一方面咧，唔好淨係睇住一啲所謂內交啊。

365
00:48:50,520 --> 00:49:10,530
即係我多次都提及到香港最好嘅角色，就好似一個已故嘅啊，新加坡國父李光耀先生所用嘅例子，就係香港應該係一隻好靈活嘅一個橡皮艇，遊走喺呢個中國嘅海冇藍之間，有時帶住一個海冇藍做一個先頭部隊去睇路。

366
00:49:44,310 --> 00:50:04,320
當然咧，舉個例子咧。當然我唔會希望就個別嘅政策呢個時候唔夠時間講啦。但係例如，譬如好似誒強積咁強積金咁擺到明咧，呢個政策咧係唔能夠幫到香港市民解決最原先個政策嘅目標嘅時候咧，係有充分嘅膽識咧去做啲破格式嘅。

367
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:39,680
最大嘅公職或者最大嘅事，第一件事上任就要取消呢個Obama Care。Obama Care係美國奧巴馬總統八年嚟咧唯一甚至係最重大嘅政績。但係如果佢哋認為喺政策上對美國係唔好嘅話咧，係有膽色同一個量度咧係適時咁去取消，甚至係改。

368
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,800
兩個行業。

369
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,120
近親繁殖。

370
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,700
因為冇更新嘅。

371
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,020
誒，都係主席嘅指教。

372
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,420
生意經營啊，只不過嗰啲親戚。

373
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,550
必然係引起倒退，黐黐外外。

374
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,790
係明白到咧，即使我哋最有智慧。

375
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:49,710
講得好，而家我哋嘅特首選噉嘅家族。

376
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,730
係需要考慮呢一方面咧，係需要妥協嘅。多謝主席。

377
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:10,270
由於咧，你係表示有意參與行政長官嘅選舉嘅。

378
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:35,330
誒第一，我正話聽到啊，陳克勤議喺度，即係引述呢個奧巴馬。

379
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:44,520
去調看呢個誒特朗普嘅説話，佢話：哦，你唔可以將美國政府當係家族生意咁傾嘅。

380
00:52:52,790 --> 00:53:03,150
係比較疏堂咁解啫嘛！一千二百個人之下有二十二萬個人去選，呢啲嘅選舉方法，我已經講過好多次，就係。

381
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:26,820
就依項議案發言時咧，應該係集中表達你對下任行政長官嘅期望，明白，而不應令人覺得你係利用依個辯論宣傳你嘅參選政綱或者爭取市民嘅支持。OK，兩個行業。

382
00:50:53,230 --> 00:51:13,240
啊！咁但係，我哋有冇講諗過話？真係要畀市民睇到我哋又真係除咗話現任政府都不斷地係嘗試或者口講嘗試咧，去解決啲問題之外咧，喺行為上咧有冇將我哋收翻嚟嘅，譬如話我哋嘅好多嘅誒誒誒sam duty啦嚇，即係用喺解決啲問。

383
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:33,250
問題上咧，例如話可唔可以真係搞搞掂港人港地啊？又或者甚至乎我都提議過嘅軍事用地嘅問題，啊，適當地去有足夠嘅視野、同決心同膽識去做呢件事。最後咧，主席，剩翻幾十秒時間咧，我想講講咧，就係我希望特首會真係一個consulatory嘅特首，即係一個協調式嘅特首。

384
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:57,080
最有自己認為啱嘅地方，但係從政咧有時咧要協調嘅話咧，即使行A去B咧係最近嘅最叻嘅人咧都咁諗嘅。但係如果社會上好多人都覺得行行一行去C先去A到B唔好直接去，應該行A to C to B嘅話咧，有時咧作為consultatory一個協調式嘅政治人咧係。

385
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,160
主席。

386
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,890
嘅人。

387
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,720
你去望啲魚。

388
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,070
係咪啊？你覺得？

389
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,390
正如我所講，係萬惡嘅。

390
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,870
你唔係潑嗰啲水啊嘛！

391
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,140
願望喺個聖誕樹裏邊。

392
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,980
嗰啲水好滾，會焫親你。

393
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,420
我提醒各位自稱愛國嘅朋友。

394
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,020
我聽到大家喺度善種善土，掛啲。

395
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,650
今日你講緊咁多個誒特首嘅候選人。

396
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,310
其實我哋中國已經係有咗一個解決嘅方案。

397
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,820
阿爺喺上面睇住呢一個噉嘅選舉制度。

398
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,470
喺度遊嚟遊去，你想捉佢嘅時候，你不如整個網去網住佢咯。

399
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:08,720
就係臨淵羨魚，不如退而結網；，與其揚湯止沸，不如釜底抽薪。

400
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:28,890
無非就係要喺千二個嘅所謂選民裏邊得到支持，亦都當然有一個。

401
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,450
係將。

402
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,030
阿基米德講。

403
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,960
噉我哋就唔使拗啦。

404
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,370
我哋先至係主人。

405
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,280
係唔使噉嘅，呢個係不平等啊嘛！

406
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,160
我哋呢個萬惡嘅制度，就係令到。

407
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:33,440
喺水下邊嘅火拎走啊！嘛，我哋今日講嘅就係話。

408
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:50,010
呢個今日喺度，個個講咧掛掛聖誕樹嘅時候，唔記得咗。

409
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,230
喺呢個議會裏邊，我係直選出身嘅，我係要得到。

410
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:07,920
新界東百幾萬嘅選民，一人一票去委任我嚟呢度嘅，而我哋嘅呢個議會裏邊有其他嘅同事。

411
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:12,070
而唔係好似Joel咁講，所有嘅動物都係平等，不過有啲動物係比其他人更有權。

412
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:02,600
我哋嘅主人係非常之講究禮貌、非常之講究文明嘅，就係我的權利不會大過你。

413
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:42,050
如果你畀個支點我，我就能夠轉動全世界。喺政治嚟講，若果你畀我一個平等嘅普選權利，我就能夠轉動所有嘅改革。

414
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:25,900
或者係佢用好通俗用以呢個譬如咁講，所有嘅動物都唔可以瞓牀，如果個鋪牀鋪咗牀單再瞓上去，咁只有牀單鋪喺度嘅豬動物先可以瞓。

415
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:25,650
我哋要要求社會嘅平等、經濟嘅平等、權利嘅平等，但係我哋冇可能係將我哋選擇權嘅平等首先係放棄咗。

416
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:50,700
我哋唔理邊個係特首嘅候選人，我哋一個公平嘅制度，令到所有要掛呢啲噉嘅願望上聖誕樹嘅人都係一個平權的持份者，由佢哋揀。

417
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,150
主席。

418
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,810
我引述。

419
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,940
同學。

420
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,550
好簡單咁講。

421
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,270
卡斯特羅。

422
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,170
而且，我為止。

423
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,360
有人話：喂，上摩出嚟搞局。

424
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,690
講呢句説話嘅人係啱啱過世嘅。

425
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:03,640
知我心者為我心憂，不知我者為我何求？

426
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:31,720
必須做好打算，這會引起幾千人的仇恨。

427
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,930
坦白講，我能將這個國家徹頭徹尾變革。

428
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,690
我哋嘅貧富差距越嚟越大，我哋嘅樓價越嚟越貴。

429
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:55,510
佢係一個律師，佢係高材生，佢出身係一個名門。

430
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:23,340
定會恩然，恩然莫明。我深信所有人都會甘之若怡。

431
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:43,000
他們中間包括一些我的親戚，一半我的朋輩，三分二我專業的同事，以及五分四我的。

432
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:50,760
所有有份去創造香港財富嘅人喺一個資商授受嘅制度裏邊，呢二十年裏邊，佢哋嘅生活係不能夠改善。個證明就係我哋嘅堅離指數係越嚟越大。

433
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,260
主席。

434
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,960
主席。

435
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,250
趁行不遠。

436
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,520
我哋今日講緊嘅係乜嘢？

437
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,290
我哋今日講緊嘅。

438
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,750
對佢嘅詆毀。

439
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,030
我會覺得非常之擔心。

440
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,740
我唔係卡特羅，我冇佢咁叻。

441
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,260
啱踢完梁國雄議員一翻咁激昂嘅誒宣言。

442
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:42,420
為咗一碗紅豆湯而出賣掌權嘅人，係永遠唔會得到自由嘅。

443
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:16,580
窮好熟悉嘅喺佢嘅階階級裏邊嘅，記得利益者嘅仇恨。

444
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:49,200
你係會得到term啊！你係會得到呢一個誒呢一個嘅揣測，你會得到佢哋嘅呢一個意嘅詆毀。

445
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:37,290
但係，我覺得講嘅係合理嘅。當你要改革嘅時候咧，不能夠、不能夠、不能夠、不能夠喺特權圈子裏邊得到掌聲嘅。

446
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:08,690
佢知道喺當年要改革古巴嘅軍事獨裁嘅暴政，佢出嚟講嘢，佢出嚟做事，佢一定會引起嗰啲。

447
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:12,870
係一次過噉樣，將大家嘅聖誕樹嘅願望實現，去委託一個真正嘅聖誕老人，而唔係冒充聖誕老人嘅人。

448
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:35,550
我無意去為我自己所謂選特首而宣傳。我同全香港人講，我阻止嘅係一個倒退，我阻止嘅係希望呢個非建制派唔好將嘅選票掟落去任何一個建制派嘅候選人身上。

449
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,150
但係。

450
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,980
病樹前頭。

451
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,900
病樹前頭萬木春。

452
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,970
就係因為佢哋否決咗政改。

453
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,240
我哋嘅議會就沉溺喺政治鬥爭。

454
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,220
佢希望我哋香港係能夠有所改變。

455
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,650
選舉制度，佢哋都要否決，跟住咧。

456
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,190
如果係噉樣嘅話，我哋香港就真係沉舟側畔。

457
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:21,840
將正如頭先梁國雄議員噉，將所有嘢推落去政治鬥爭。

458
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:54,390
呢一種以政治鬥爭為光嘅諗法，我好希望我哋下一屆嘅特首要改變。

459
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:31,330
佢哋好擔心呢種可以批評小圈子選舉嘅呢種噉嘅話題會冇咗，所以一個幾好嘅。

460
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:18,430
本身我哋今年就可以每個市民都有權去投票選出我哋特首，點解我哋大家冇權去選？

461
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:45,540
否決政改、罵政改，係嘛？否決制度、罵制度，呢一種嘅做法，咪可以繼續一路延伸落去咯。

462
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:40,620
周圍嘅地方都不斷咁改善，不斷咁發展，好有競爭，希望一路可以向前行。

463
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:08,660
剛才梁國雄議員講：，啊，我哋嘅特首就係由一千二百人選出嚟呢個小圈子選舉，所以佢係病惡嘅源頭。但係我想話畀佢聽，係邊個否決政改？

464
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:07,470
最近我同朋友傾偈，我話香港而家係咩環境？你可唔可以誒同我點評一下？佢畀咗首詩我，佢話：沉舟側畔千帆過。

465
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,120
講。

466
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,910
要改變應受性，要改善應受性，係有三樣嘢。

467
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:03,070
所以，我哋係非常之憂慮未來香港嘅前景。

468
01:02:54,330 --> 01:03:00,430
除咗制度嘅應受性，仲有政治應受性、文化應受性。

469
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,200
我好希望下一屆特區政府，我哋特首能夠扭轉一種嘅思維。

470
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:12,090
喺下一屆行政長官，我好希望佢真係可以延續誒建屋嘅目標。

471
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:36,900
令到我哋香港係真真正正能夠可以行前一步。

472
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:28,600
政治制度嘅改革之外，我哋都應該要諗下建立一套比較好嘅文化。

473
01:01:52,840 --> 01:02:01,340
呢種扭轉咩思維咧？就係只要有普選，先能夠解決所有問題嘅呢一種思維。

474
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:13,930
因為佢哋過去嘅嗰套故事咧，就係話畀所有市民聽，嗱，只要有普選個行政長官有應受性，有應受性咁做嘢咧就掂啦。

475
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:46,610
係萬賣萬零，當然我哋知道我哋制度要改變，制度要改善，改善行政長官嘅應受性呢一個問題。但係根據馬斯維伯同我哋。

476
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:51,260
架構嘅重組係有個必要性。若果冇辦法去重組，我相信過去嘅問題係會繼續延續落去。因為佢揾嚿地翻嚟，喂，我地又畀咗你啦。噉啊屋咧，屋啊起啊，喂，交通問題未解決，所以結果就打死結。

477
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:34,220
喂！全世界好多地方嘅佢哋當地嘅領導人，都係由普選產生，又唔見佢哋可以好似阿梁國雄議員講啊，只要你畀一個支點，我我就可以扭轉全世界，完全唔係嗰回事。但係呢一樣嘢，佢哋係好似咁多年嚟一路。

478
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:20,930
尤其是建立一套良好嘅政治文化係非常之重要，但係若果以批鬥、以政治為綱嘅呢一種政治文化，我好相信絕對唔適合香港，所以我希望下一屆行政長官喺除咗推動。

479
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:57,500
最近故宮博物館嘅事件，正正可以畀我哋睇到呢一種文化係點樣蠶食緊我哋香港。而家同所有地方一講同香港合作，個個都擰曬頭。喂，你哋好慢㗎，你哋啲嘢有排搞喎，有排拗喎，拗參莽之後都唔知做唔做到㗎。

480
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:33,470
但係要延續建屋嘅目標，今屆嘅特區政府，大家去睇到兩個局，可能一個係揾地，一個係起屋，跟住搞埋交通。但係次次攞到地翻嚟起唔到屋，原因可能係交通問題，可能有人反對問題。其實呢個政府。

481
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,520
就針對。

482
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,200
仲有冇其他員上發言？

483
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,440
對於下任嘅行政長官咧。

484
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:46,470
另外，亦都有其他議員同事咧。

485
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:54,720
如果冇嘅，郭偉強議員，現在可以就各項修正案發言，發言時限係五分鐘。

486
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:44,000
所以今日我哋希望藉住呢個機會去表達我哋嘅意見。主席本人謹此陳辭。

487
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:30,380
係令到佢即係即係否定咗咧，佢要有呢個責任，因為事實上咧，維護國家主權咧係因為香港有港獨正在滋長。

488
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:36,630
好有期望，但係亦都唔好希望佢跌入政治嘅泥沼裏面。面對政治嘅問題，一定要迎刃而解，努力去解決。

489
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:43,010
無論任何一屆嘅行政長官咧，都必須要有效咁積極壓止呢啲港獨嘅蔓延咧，先至能夠確保我哋香港繼續穩定向前發展。

490
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:24,870
另外，我哋都希望政府咧能夠發揮香港嘅優勢。香港優勢在乜嘢？舉個例子，中醫藥嘅問題。香港中醫同埋中藥本身有佢好好嘅潛質，所以第一嘅行政長官。

491
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:15,290
主席，對於其他修正案嘅處理咧，其實必須要強調，誒，任何刪除咗關於維護國家主權啦、誒貫徹落實一國兩制呢啲重要嘅字眼咧，都係。

492
01:04:51,540 --> 01:05:08,890
我希望咧，政府係可以就住個問題去揾出個解決嘅方案，包括咧係充分地畀權、充分地授權畀建屋嘅部門去處理佢哋所面對嘅問題，改善拆遷嘅賠償。

493
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:45,160
董建華先生佢提出要建立中藥港，但係過去畀人批評就係中藥港得個港呢個，亦都係現實。我哋諗翻政府有冇為中藥界、中醫界注資成立任何基金？咁多年嚟，二十年啦，政府係冇任何幫助，只有用條例。

494
01:05:45,160 --> 01:06:05,170
框框係框死佢哋嘅發展，噉我哋香港咧想發展中醫藥、中藥咧、中醫咧係冇辦法發展得出嚟嘅，所以我希望政府係能夠發揮我哋中醫同埋中藥佢獨特嘅優勢，面對國際嘅優勢。

495
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:25,180
可以喺香港起個中醫院，大力啲去幫手發展中藥業，令到香港可以藉住呢樣嘢建立多一個新嘅產業，令到年輕人有一個新嘅出路。仲有好多呢類嘅例子，今日得七分鐘講唔曬，所以我哋對於下一屆行政長官係好。

496
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:57,800
都係主席。

497
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,740
另外咧，亦都。

498
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,450
咁同埋咧喺。

499
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:54,480
誒掌握一帶一路嗰度咧，亦都係。

500
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,160
嘅發言，因為咧總共咧一共有四十。

501
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,370
增加嘅內容包括咧，其實誒。

502
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:24,230
説法咧係今日的我咧打到昨日的我嘅。

503
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:38,260
喺度咧，誒，多謝各位議員同事。

504
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:55,600
會提一啲對香港有利、建設可行嘅建議。

505
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,030
咁另外喺度感謝咧，李慧瓊議員所提出嘅一啲誒。

506
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:50,950
三位議員嘅發言包括我在內啦嚇。其實正如咧，我尋日發言所講，對香港有心嘅人咧。

507
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:05,810
而一啲別有用心嘅人士咧，就會繼續假惺惺咁批評現有嘅政制，並未有真正提出任何嘅改善方向。

508
01:07:48,800 --> 01:08:00,180
針對咧誒而家嗰個政治體制咧，去提出一啲修訂，就話咧一定要有佢哋所講嘅雙普選先至收貨。咁但係問題就係，

509
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:49,250
土地嘅供應咧短缺咧，其實呢個眾所周知。噉啊，阿陳建波議員咧喺發言嘅時候咧，亦都提到我哋要大力開拓一啲維港以外嘅土地增加。

510
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:30,660
尤其是一啲作為火車頭嘅產業帶動咩係火車頭咧？相信大家都會同意，包括係創新科技呢啲產業，而一帶一路咧，亦都有助推動呢啲創新產業嘅開拓同埋市場。

511
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:20,470
喺二零一四年否定咗政改方案嘅時候咧，其實大家都好清楚，必然係維持翻原有嘅選舉制度。所以當佢哋當年否定咗呢個政改方案之後，然後而家又話點解會原地踏步咧？咁其實呢個。

512
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:14,850
阿李慧瓊議員咧提到咧，就喺誒一帶一路嘅內容入邊咧，亦都要拓展我哋嘅機遇，因為事實上咧，無論係一啲坊間嘅學者啦，或者係我哋議會嘅同事咧，都提到誒香港嘅經濟咧過分單一化，欠缺多元化。

513
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,030
開始表決。

514
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,260
至於。

515
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,440
去做一啲解釋。

516
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,420
請各位核對所在表決。

517
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,370
啊，主席，我同意收轉局。

518
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,720
咁但係，如果喺而家港獨？

519
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:57,050
係，只會令到香港繼續混亂落去，所以咧。

520
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,310
麥美娟議員要求記名點票，點票鐘響五分鐘。

521
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:39,900
我現在請張華峯議員就議案同意修正案。張華峯議員。

522
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:52,180
逐漸滋長嘅情況底下咧，如果唔盡早壓止嘅話咧，

523
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:42,870
誒單憑佢哋對於一國兩制嘅理解咧，其實係佢哋自創，甚至乎偏離原著嘅。

524
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:16,560
楊嶽橋提出修訂案嘅楊嶽橋議員咧，煞有介事咁去就住佢刪除咗維護國家主權。

525
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:57,610
偉強議員嘅議案，我現在向各位提出待議議題係張華峯議員就郭偉強議員嘅議案同意嘅議案，同意嘅修正案予以通過。現在付諸表決，贊成嘅請舉手。
