1
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,270
Thank you, Miss Answorth.

2
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,770
第八十三條A。

3
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,440
眼線凝就係呢個係嘛？

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,540
此外咧，就係按議事規則。

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,430
同埋誒誒政府啊，噉樣㗎。

6
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,990
而家直接係進入第二項程序。

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,010
性別承認跨部門工作小組嘅工作進度。

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,060
同埋咧，性別承認跨部門工作小組發出嘅性別承認諮詢文件。

9
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:17,690
之後咧，我哋係發出個立法會嘅文件C.B.括弧四一三八六足十六-hyphen十七括弧零一。

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,670
委員，啊！而家我哋已經係有足夠嘅法定人數，而家正式宣佈開會。自從上次會議。

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:40,310
收取曉款嘅功能嘅資料，咁呢個咧係提到就係話法院第一就唔唔係要處理呢樣嘢，交翻畀郵局啊。

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:01:00,740
各位委員就今日嘅會議討論事項，如果有任何直接或者間接金錢利益，請喺發言之前披露有關嘅利益。

13
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:43,170
而家我哋首先係請誒工作小組嘅秘書顏善華女士介紹工作嘅進度，之後我就會請委員發言。

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:02:04,410
Welcome. Yeah, it's now come to your turn, Miss Michelle Answorth. We would like you to give us a brief introduction of the consultation paper and the ideas.

15
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:30,400
係運房局同司法機構處理提為司法機構建議取消裁判法院就不涉及法庭程序嘅交通違例定額罰款。

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:24,480
文件係立法會C/B括弧四一三八六足十六-hi分十七括弧零二，係政府當局提為性別承認跨部門工作小組嘅工作進度。

17
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,970
啊，謝謝，議長。

18
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,980
covering firstly.

19
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,700
which is known as W's case.

20
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,320
和的內容， of such a scheme.

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,670
and fourthly, to reiterate some key points.

22
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,660
The IWD's study is divided into two parts.

23
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,150
第三ly，The next stage of the IWG's work.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,810
我哋想覆蓋四個領域，簡介喺呢個介紹。

25
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,370
The need to establish a gender recognition scheme, if any.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,040
First of all, the background to the establishment of the IWG.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,090
第二，個係一個總覽，係IWG的諮詢文件。

28
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,180
和，要提出適當的建議，並提出建議，和建議。

29
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:58,390
The IWG was established in response to the observations made by the Court of Final Appeal in W and against Registrar of Marriages.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:22,780
我我係滿意有呢個機會向成員簡介目前進展，關於跨部門工作小組就性別認同的作業。

31
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:44,870
和第二，post recognition issues which may arise in consequence of legal gender recognition, should a gender recognition scheme be introduced?

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:03:10,090
with regard to the background, the IWG was set up in January 2014 to consider legislation and incidental administrative measures that may be required to protect the rights of transsexual persons in Hong Kong in all legal contexts.

33
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,880
scope of the IWG's study.

34
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,020
with regard to the current situation in Hong Kong.

35
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,550
和《的Executive Consultation Papers》附在《的Panel Paper》for members reference。

36
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,670
諮詢期運行至10月31日，2017。

37
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,660
The consultation paper is accessible online at the IWG's website.

38
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,130
with regard to the consultation paper, which is entitled Part One: Gender Recognition.

39
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,250
在香港，和如果，可能的標準和程序，對於性別認可。

40
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:33,540
legal gender recognition generally refers to the official recognition of a person's gender identity.

41
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:29,000
和一 transsexual 人， who has undergone full sex reassignment surgery， also known as SRS or GRS。

42
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:44,290
their self-perception of being male or female, in law, as reflected in public registries and key identification documents.

43
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:19,880
在 certain circumstances， a change of gender is recognised in Hong Kong， where the issue is one of identification rather than legal status.

44
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:56,060
它 means that in the eyes of the law, a person is seen to be of his or her acquired gender, as opposed to the gender that he or she was assigned at birth.

45
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:08,650
There is currently no legislation in Hong Kong which provides for the recognition of the reassigned, acquired or preferred gender of a person for all legal purposes.

46
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:21,310
and I would like to add that the study of the IWG is confined to the problems facing transsexual or transgender persons. Other issues such as same-sex marriage, civil partnership, and discrimination against sexual minorities are outside the.

47
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:52,800
on 23 of June 2017, the IWG released its consultation paper on the first part of its study to seek the views of the public on issues concerning legal gender recognition, including whether a gender recognition scheme should be established.

48
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,460
性別。

49
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,160
和的issues involved are complicated and controversial.

50
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,720
such as the United Kingdom's Gender Recognition Act 2004.

51
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,750
firstly， whether a gender recognition scheme should be established in Hong Kong.

52
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,270
和的 wider consequences for the community of legal recognition of gender change.

53
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:04,530
the the major issues on which the IWG is now consulting the public include

54
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,970
第二，ly， the criteria for determining whether a person is eligible for gender recognition.

55
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:49,720
另一方面，一些羣體和個別人士有表達關心，關於可能立法在這個領域的影響。

56
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:40,050
on the one hand, there are medical, social and legal issues at stake for those diagnosed as having gender dysphoria, which need to be tackled.

57
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:47,780
和第三ly，the procedure for gender recognition，including evidential requirements，what type of authority should be given the power to determine applications for gender recognition？

58
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:24,280
The IWD study has found that there is no single uniform approach around the world to the type of scheme, the requirements and the procedures for gender recognition.

59
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:35,160
this may include among others medical requirements, residential requirements, minimum minimum age, marital status and the number of years the person has lived in the reassigned, acquired or preferred gender.

60
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:10,940
在 over 100 overseas jurisdictions and the standards of international bodies, and has also been examining issues relating to the operation of a gender recognition scheme, if one were to be established in Hong Kong.

61
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:07,900
在W's case， the quarter-final appeal ruled that a transsexual person who had undergone full SRS should be entitled to marry a person of the sex opposite to his or her reassigned gender.

62
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:49,370
which involves the removal of the original genital organs and construction of some form of genital organs of the opposite sex, may apply for a change in the sex entry on their Hong Kong ID cards, and if successful, will be issued with a replacement Hong Kong ID card reflecting their re.

63
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:28,470
而家，focus of W's case was on the law of marriage. The court of final appeal also observed that the government should consider how to address problems facing transsexual persons in all areas of the law by drawing reference to overseas law and practice.

64
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:55,620
The scope of the IWG study in the first part of its study, the IWG has been looking at the condition known as gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria, and has been carrying out a comparative study of the legislation schemes and case law on gender recognition.

65
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,040
多謝主席。

66
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,520
with regard to the next stage of the IWG's work.

67
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,940
和 whether foreign gender recognition decisions should be recognised.

68
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,970
在 view of the complexity of the issues and the different approaches adopted by different jurisdictions around the world.

69
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:33,850
the issues involved, the IWG maintains an open mind and does not have any preferred preferred position at this moment.

70
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:18,700
The IWG will continue to consult widely in the course of its work before finalising its recommendations to the government.

71
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:23,060
我們希望這次公眾諮詢exercise may facilitate a rational, informed and objective discussion in the community.

72
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:12,480
The I W G is maintaining an open mind and has not yet arrived at any confirmed views or position on how these issues should be addressed.

73
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:30,450
Thank you once again for the opportunity to brief the panel. in In concluding the presentation, I'd just like to reiterate the following key points.

74
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:46,610
Accordingly, the consultation paper seeks to discuss the relevant issues as objectively and comprehensively as possible, so as to promote informed debate within the community.

75
00:12:47,230 --> 00:13:01,660
在決定的路向前，於其建議向政府，IWG將仔細分析並考慮適當，公眾在諮詢期間收到的意見。

76
00:11:47,790 --> 00:12:04,210
第二，ly， it's evident from the research presented in the I W G's consultation paper that there is no single uniform approach around the world to the procedure for legal gender recognition and the complex issues that it raises.

77
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:47,380
首先，我們 recognise that the subject of gender recognition involves important legal, medical, social and human rights issues, which are complicated and controversial and may have wide-ranging policy implications.

78
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:47,810
After studying the results of the public consultation, the IWG will proceed to the second part of the study concerning the impact of gender recognition on existing laws and practice in the event that a gender recognition scheme is to be established in Hong Kong.

79
00:10:48,670 --> 00:11:08,680
作為part of this study，the IWG will review all existing legislative provisions and administrative measures in Hong Kong， which may be affected by legal gender recognition， so that any required legislative or procedural reform may be followed up by the government.

80
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,270
Okay.

81
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,190
有冇邊位委員想發問啊？

82
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:12,220
Thank you, Miss Anspach。啊，我諗而家就係啊，我哋委員發問嘅時間，睇下邊一位發問。

83
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:27,210
做嘅時候啊，會唔會究竟佢點樣去承別承認嗰個人嘅誒性別？咁可能講得簡單啲，即係因為可能好多啊。

84
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:34,670
係周浩鼎議員、陳志全議員。誒，我諗誒，而家係先兩位議員，每一位係誒四分鐘啦，係嘛？噉我盡寬鬆少少啦。如果再有事議嘅誒，我都我都排埋啦嚇。噉啊，首先係阿周浩鼎議員。

85
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:24,890
第三ly， The consultation paper published by the IWG seeks the views of the community on a number of issues concerning legal gender recognition， including whether a gender recognition scheme should be established in Hong Kong and if so， the contents of the scheme. And fourthly， given the controversial nature

86
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:56,170
誒，唔該啊，主席。咁咧就誒，首先都誒多謝即係律政司同埋工作小組嘅朋友，都花咗好多功夫去做呢一份嘅諮詢文件，同埋關於嗰個性別承認制度嘅即係一個討論嚇。咁咧就誒誒，必須要講咧就係誒，我哋都希望透過。

87
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:16,180
今次即係呢個會議啦，啊，或者往後可能都聽到好多公眾一啲嘅表達嘅理解，去了解多啲關於啊。第一就係我哋嘅社會啊，要唔要而家去做呢個性別承認嘅制度？同埋，如果假設係要做嘅，噉係點樣去做法嗱？我諗呢兩個方。

88
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:36,190
方向我諗，即係喺我哋希望我哋透過今次嘅委員會同埋往後嘅諮詢都可以瞭解多啲嘅。咁誒第一咧就我有個誒誒問題咧，就想請教下咧，就係嗱第一誒，我就見到咧，其實誒政府嘅諮詢文件咧，裡面都有提過咧，就係話啊，除

89
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:56,200
採用性別承認制度去處理而家見到嘅問題之外咧，啊，其實可能用行政措施，即係話，例如如果係啊變性嘅朋友咧，如果喺透過行政措施喺身份證上邊度係完全將佢個性別係轉咗，噉就可以。

90
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:16,210
確立到佢嗰個性別啦，咁呢一個嘅行政措施其實會唔會都係可以解決到誒現行嘅一啲嘅問題咧？咁嗱，呢個係我第一個問題啦。第二個問題咧就係誒，因為談及到呢一個性別承認制度裡面咧，亦都牽涉到假設如果要

91
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,540
啊。

92
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,250
就好大量嘅歧視。

93
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,220
啊！主席，我諗或者政府有冇留意今年？

94
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,470
can be satisfied for all legal purposes.

95
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,070
OK，啊，跟住係啊，陳志全議員。係，誒，多謝主席。

96
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,210
這些都是問題，在IWG正在尋求公眾意見的階段。

97
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:44,050
the purpose of the study, which is which is to find how the position on of transsexual and transgender people can be

98
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:52,730
咁其實我我問個司長嘅，究竟嚟而家係第一階段第一部分啦，成個工作做完到到真係有實際行動，無論係措施定係立法，要幾耐時間咧？

99
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:43,340
作為是點出在在紙上，IWG在這點上沒有決定的觀點在於任何問題上，都提出在紙上。和，Miss Ainsworth，sorry，可以講得更近一點嗎？Sorry。

100
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:11,910
就話議題比想像中複雜，同埋越早咧就覺得越多嘢要去兼顧，超過一百個唔同地方嘅法例要去處理。咁呢個我明白嘅，但係真係好多人未必等得到。

101
00:18:50,110 --> 00:19:07,940
it it would appear that there are a number of post recognition issues where their legal situation would need to be explored. So whether administrative measures could cover that is is at this stage to still be studied.

102
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:47,500
電視機前面觀眾未必好了解我哋呢份文件裏面嘅內容，所以我講得簡單啲、直白啲咁講咧，就係話誒，如果一個人要選擇去轉變佢嗰個性別咧，啊，一般我哋嘅理解咧，就係可能佢需要做一個醫學嘅手術嘅。咁如果佢能夠完整地完成到呢？

103
00:15:47,500 --> 00:16:07,510
呢個醫學嘅手術咧，咁基本上咧，佢即係有呢一個嘅證明，亦都做咗啦。噉佢當然咧就可能或許可以透過我哋頭先講嘅行政措施喺身份證上面咧就更改佢嗰個性別，咁亦都可以達到到佢嗰個目的啦。噉我就想問下咧，即係如果喺呢個性別承認制度裡面，假設如

104
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:27,520
如果將來去做嘅時候，係咪應該都係有埋呢一個嘅醫學上面嘅嗰個誒手術完成，去作為一個啊有力嘅證據咧？咁因為其實我亦都見到文件裡面誒，亦都將正反裡面嘅意見擺出嚟啦。咁有一啲嘅朋友可能咧就會擔心話，如果冇一個醫學嘅。

105
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:47,530
嘅手術去證明嘅時候咧，即係講得簡單啲，就係話誒，可能一個人表面係男，但佢心理上實際係女。咁但係如果佢唔經過一個醫學嘅手術嘅情況底下咧，噉佢其實好老實講就會令到啊，可能有其他嘅人咧都會覺得對於佢嗰個性別究竟係男定？

106
00:16:47,530 --> 00:17:07,540
定係女咧，可能又會產生一啲嘅爭議噉，或者亦都未必好清楚噉，所以咧喺呢度方面咧，我就想話問下咧，即係誒誒局方或者係誒工作小組喺呢方面嘅睇法究竟係點，或者係即係對於我哋頭先剛才講啦，其實係唔係可能醫學上經過一個如

107
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:27,550
完整嘅手術處理咗，噉就比較簡單咁處理到呢個問題，就可以讓到變性嘅朋友咧，可以獲得佢嗰個性別嘅確立，咁又可能有機會咧減少一啲嘅爭議。噉就想睇下呢方面嗰個意見，大家即係會唔會有咩諗法咁解嘅？Missingsworth or others？Yeah. Well, in fact.

108
00:17:44,820 --> 00:18:04,830
the the IWG at this point has no confirmed view on the various issues raised, including issues such as the the type of criteria, whether sex reassignment surgery will be required, the extent to which evidence of that would be.

109
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:32,830
With regard to the other question about administrative measures and the extent to which that would satisfy the requirements, again that is an issue which is is discussed in the paper. We're seeking the views of the public. We would need to explore at a later date whether simply administrative measures can come.

110
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,350
yeah。

111
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,700
啊！

112
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,430
the the issue of

113
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,920
We will of course need.

114
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,790
with regard to

115
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,530
可能真係要十年八年嘅時間都唔定。

116
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,950
time to analyse the responses and to then consider the next stage.

117
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:23,470
sorry your your second point about the complexity of the issue短期措施嚇。

118
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:07,100
所以，太早喺呢個階段，唔可以畀任何嘅指標，當時嘅研究會完成。

119
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,640
我相信呢單唔係第一單，我擔心亦都唔係最後一單。即係政府做或者。

120
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:50,960
With regard to the timetable question, at this stage, because this is just a consultation paper.

121
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:18,540
佢唔叫佢嘅佢嘅認同性別，可唔可以唔叫嗰兩個字啊？即係唔叫先生或者小姐啊？即係呢啲咁簡單嘅事咧，有時都困擾咗佢哋好耐。誒，譬如喺制度上誒一啲。

122
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:34,560
我哋手上呢一份性別承認諮詢文件咧，就只係第一部分。其實咧，真係等咗好耐，等咗三年嘅時間。由二零一四年成立呢個跨部門工作小組，就承諾兩年之內交第一份諮詢文件。咁第一次就交唔到啦，跟住。

123
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:54,570
就話希望喺二零一六年年底，亦都交唔到嚇，噉啊再承諾咧就係二零一七年第一季，但到到上一次我記得施政報告咧，司長就話希望喺佢嘅屆內啦，即係上一屆政府尾啦，咁終於喺誒六月咧就出咗呢份諮詢文件，噉我都問過司長司。

124
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:36,590
今個月七月八號有一個誒性別認同係女性嘅跨性別朋友喺港鐵嘅大圍站嗰度咧，就跳橋自殺就死咗。噉佢喺社交網站嗰度就即係都係透露翻同社會格格不入，長期得唔到接納，誒承受。

125
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:25,930
即係法律程序嗰啲係需要時間，但我都希望政府可以即係向跨性別人士或者關心呢個議題嘅朋友去再一次清楚啲講下你哋個時間表究竟係乜嘢喺到到最後階段，即係完成嗰個叫做決定立唔立法、立唔立呢個性別承認條例，到到立。

126
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:45,940
成中間有冇一啲誒短中期嘅措施可以做到咧？嗯，呢個諮詢報告就好好小心嘅寫嘢，即係成日都會話誒，只係諮詢唔代表工作小組嘅任何立場噉。即係我明白嘅，但係譬如以張德明誒先生，你參與咗成。

127
00:21:45,940 --> 00:22:05,950
個工作少咗，我諗你都會感受到一啲跨性別人士佢哋真係喺現實生活裏邊遇到一啲困難。譬如誒，佢哋進入咗嗰個即係異性性別嘅生活體驗嘅時候，佢要去譬如銀行，叫佢唔好再叫佢小姐嗱，或者唔好再叫佢先生噉，唔好即係嗱，佢未變到佢。

128
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:38,830
政府可以做到嘅誒搜身啊、誒拘留啊、監禁啊、誒呢啲可唔可以即係政府可以喺呢個中間嘅時候可以做啲措施，令到佢哋更加即係有尊嚴噉樣去生活咧？咁嚇。嗯，Miss Ansrus or Professor Chan？

129
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,690
舉過啲嘅例子咧。

130
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,010
權益嘅人士都會有啲即係。

131
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,640
短 term措施。

132
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:42,690
我諗佢又要進入諮詢即係階段先至可以即係處理啦。即係我我我講多次嘅立場就希望，即係中短期措施都可以做到，因為等十年我哋見到個問題出現一路都。

133
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:28,640
好心急或者亦都係失望，即係等咗等咗好長嘅時間，到到而家第一步有呢份資訊文件，但係連嗰個冇話時間畀個估計，係咪真係十年八年先至能夠完成咧？呢個估計都都達唔到。噉你話中期誒短期嘅措施誒？

134
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:21,610
就完結啦。咁唔知我哋個事務委員會喺十月嗰個翻嚟嗰個會期會唔會太問？如果係太問，可唔可以喺九月尾可以誒做到一個諮詢？唔同即係持份者可以上嚟表達佢意見咧？噉樣。O.K. 啊，係兩個問題啊。第一部分就係啊，Mr. Ainsworth。

135
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:47,880
Well, I imagine that the government will be carefully looking at the terms of the consultation paper. I can't comment. I'm only here representing the I W G. So I presume that the government will be carefully looking into the issues that have been raised in the paper.

136
00:23:48,160 --> 00:24:08,170
和任何必要或可能措施， may may be looked at and may be studied as to whether they could be looked at in the interim。主席，我當然明白，我唔會可以喺呢度同阿顏女士去辯論啦。咁但係即係我諗啲關心跨性別。

137
00:24:43,050 --> 00:25:03,060
嗰啲跨性別人士生活在一啲好大嘅即係壓力嘅困擾之下，我哋做到一啲嘢，都開到一啲方便之門去幫到佢哋。我覺得政府係值得去做。另外，主席，我想趁呢個機會提出，我希望我哋本事務委員會可以有一個即係誒公眾諮詢，就住呢份諮詢文件。但因為呢個諮詢期咧係去到誒十月尾。

138
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,120
係。

139
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,070
consulted on.

140
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,080
Mr. Ensmers。

141
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,750
知就呢一點而言，誒小組有冇特別嘅諗法住啫？

142
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:05,620
we we have looked in the content of the consultation paper, we've actually looked at the issues.

143
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:56,570
Again, those are those are actually issues that we are covering in the issues to be.

144
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:19,090
我相信即係小組應唔應該去就呢一點去考慮咧？就係誒，當政府係考慮點樣符合基本法三十七條同埋《人權法案》十九二條相關嘅人權準則之後咧，其實應該係要包括其他。

145
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:41,900
我啊，Mr.張啊，You would like to take the question，張達明先生係或者我都講少少我自己一啲嘅睇法啦。當然都希望明白咧，就係我作為嘅工作小組其中一個成員咧，噉就有啲問題咧，我係唔可以代表到成個小組去回答，即係阿陳議員嘅。

146
00:25:41,900 --> 00:26:01,910
咁但係當然咧，譬如我個人嚟講咧，其實都係心急嘅。其實亦都明白到咧，其實係即係特別係好多跨性別嘅人士咧，其實佢哋都好焦急，佢哋都希望可以盡快見到有啲嘅改革啦。咁只能夠講咧，就係我自己都好希望咧，即係。

147
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:21,920
即係個工作小組，即係嚟緊咧，我哋都可以盡量，我哋會加快我哋腳步去做咯。咁但係，即係坦白講，我都講唔到一啲好確實嘅時間表咧，係回應。即係唔係好確實，但係大約你哋預計用幾多年？呢個可唔可以講？誒，我我諗誒，我係有個困難啦。作為小組成個成員咧，因為都明白，我諗陳議都明白呢個呢啲呢對。

148
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:41,930
小組嘅運作咧，其實通常咧就即係淨係一個成員咧，我我好難我去代表個組咧係去即係講呢啲嘅問題。咁但係我我我自己係誒特別覺得有啲不幸嘅事件出現咧，大家都唔想見咯嚇。咁但係當然我有一點想指出咧，就係話的確陳議員提到一啲嘅所謂短期措施啊，其他方面譬如。

149
00:26:44,100 --> 00:27:04,110
即係起碼我自己嘅個人嘅睇法咧，就未必一定咧係會依賴或者等待我哋嘅工作小組嘅建議咯。因為有一啲譬如啊，舉舉舉例，似乎係涉及到一啲嘅歧視式嘅問題，反歧視噉。但係希望議員都明白咧，我哋喺嗰個報告裏面都開始講得好清楚。

150
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:24,120
我㗎啦，呢個小組嘅權限咧，其實係唔會處理咧，係嗰個反歧視嗰個嘅問題。主席，呢個我想發表一一點意見，好短嘅就係阿張大明教授，你覺唔覺得？雖然你個小組嘅權限唔係，但係真係不能避免，即係要喺歧視條例嗰度去做功夫，即即使淨係完成。

151
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:44,130
咗一個性別承認嘅程序咧，都未必能夠解決到即係而家佢哋誒一啲跨性別朋友所面對嘅問題。即係雖然唔係你，你哋劃得清楚、好清楚，你哋嗰個界線好小心啦。即係婚姻民事結合又唔係你哋誒歧視條例又唔係你哋啊，但係你我唔覺得係係需要，即係唔。

152
00:27:44,130 --> 00:28:04,140
係你嘅小組，但係另一邊係都係要做呢個功夫啦。先先陳宇所講啦，你知道唔係我哋個小組咧，我就比如今日我以小組成員嘅身份咧，係比較難喺呢方面去講埋，因為我知道其實有啲嘅範疇咧，可能立法會或者同建屋其他部門咧喺嗰度或者有另外跟進嘅地方咯。咁但係因為呢點就比較超越咗我自己。

153
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:24,150
作為少數成員可以講嘅啲嘅意見咯，咁希望好得。誒嗱，我諗時間咧已經超咗好多啦。誒，你第二個問題就係提出誒會唔會進行公眾諮詢？噉我諗我睇下啲大家委員有冇意見啊，喺呢一方面。贊成。係阿張超雄。同意，同意。嚇，同意。應該啊。誒，基本上冇反對。

154
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:44,160
係嘛冇反對咧？可能我哋需要做嘅係誒誒喺嗰個小組諮詢期之前啦。我提我哋試下揾下期同埋地方啊，應該九月底啊，或者十月初啊噉樣樣誒，我嚟試下睇下安排唔安排到啊？安排到我通知大家就會擺上網通知。

155
00:28:44,160 --> 00:29:04,170
嗰啲相關有心嚟表達意見嘅團體噉樣處理，好冇咁跟住就係楊樂橋議員。多謝多謝主席。誒，其實我都係同阿陳志全議員一樣，係表達嗰個焦慮同心急，即係即係時間上，始終即係中心法院嘅案件咧，一三年五月係出判詞。

156
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:24,320
係去到即係今年六月先至出諮詢文件，咁仲要拖多幾耐咧？誒，我明白今天出席嘅即係誒小組嘅成員咧，係未必能夠畀到個時間表嘅。噉我只係喺度希望咧係公開咁講，我哋希望能夠盡快係律政司能夠推動到。

157
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:44,330
即係相關即係法例，因為始終亦都當中審法院出咗一個判決，而相關嘅法例未作相應嘅誒跟進嘅時候咧，其實亦都係有一個好大嘅法律真空期。咁呢個亦都係有違反公義嘅。咁呢一點，我想特別指出。第二咧，主席就係針對即係誒今次小組入邊。

158
00:29:44,350 --> 00:30:04,360
誒嗰個諮詢方向，因為中心法院喺案件裏邊咧，係提到誒個命令，其實係應該係包括手術後由男變女嘅變性人嘅呢一個體術嘅。咁但係其實呢一項體術唔係只侷限於該等人士，而係應該咧。

159
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,580
嗯哼。

160
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,050
即係跨性別嘅手術嘅。

161
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,920
所以誒都可以講話係有啲失望嘅，即係我哋就。

162
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,040
所以我們 hoping to get some response from the public on on their views on that.

163
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,500
有冇一個修例嘅時間表？好唔緊要。啊，Miss Angel，頭先有議員都有問嘅。

164
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,160
Phase has been completed. It, I believe, that it's too early to give an indication of a timetable.

165
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:09,160
The timetable. I can simply reiterate what I've said earlier that at this stage, until the consultation.

166
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:34,550
在它的範疇，則不僅僅是跨性別人士，它也涵蓋和詢問跨性別人士的立場。

167
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:33,790
一班義工咧就當佢係完成咗責任，即係法庭都都講咗，其實佢應該係誒收禮嘅，咁所以誒。

168
00:32:51,340 --> 00:33:03,830
期望咧係比較具體啲啦，誒，同埋亦都希望即係呢一個嘅報告咧，都促使政府咧係及早修改有關嘅條例啦。咁誒。

169
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:39,600
嘅人士㗎，咁呢個包括其他人係咩意思咧？例如手術後誒轉轉換咗性別嘅人啦，又或者唔適合、唔需要、唔願意去做變性手術嘅人士，呢啲咧其實我相信都係符合中審法院嘅要求嘅。噉我唔。

170
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:25,910
from not just the perspective of persons who've gone through sex reassignment surgery, but also more generally persons who, for one reason or another, are not able to do the surgery. For example, so the consultation paper is actually broader.

171
00:31:42,980 --> 00:32:02,990
O.K.仲有冇冇咧？就係下一位係阿張超雄議員。好啊，主席。誒，正如楊學喬議員所講咧，其實中心法院出咗個誒判令誒，雖然佢會話到，就算法例未改咧，即係嗰個將來呢啲已經完成。

172
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:26,340
人嘅婚姻咧，佢都會承認嘅。咁但係法例重觸改咧，呢個都係政府嘅應有之義。咁而家即係迂迴曲折啦，又啊呢個小組嘅工作，然後就推出呢個文件噉。

173
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:46,350
但個文件本身咧，就對於立法咧，又冇一個時間表，或者亦都冇就住誒立法去禁止誒呢啲嘅性別身份嘅性別認同嘅歧，成認嘅歧視咧。誒，即係修改我哋而家嘅歧視法例。咁所以。

174
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,450
呀。

175
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,760
好。

176
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,190
誒。

177
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,640
時間表噉樣去跟進你哋嘅建議咯。

178
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,530
有案例，同埋有法庭嘅要求。

179
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,110
一種情況，咁誒我。

180
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,470
啊，咁跟住啊，係我嘅。

181
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,860
咁誒，我覺得唔好迴避咯，同埋其實。

182
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,500
咁真係好不幸啦！即係呢個其實都已經係。

183
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,140
誒，因為嗰個佢係有做到嚇，就有講翻一個噉嘅歷史出嚟先啦。

184
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:40,460
當然啦，我哋都明白修例係誒，即係定咗法仲，即係係一個唔容易再改嘅。

185
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:29,790
第二咧就係我其實想問下委員會啦，因為咧其實誒頭先譬如我聽到誒其他議員都有講提到，如果有一啲人。

186
00:35:52,770 --> 00:36:03,420
係咧，如果收唔到例咧，就係佢就會用翻common law咯，用翻佢嗰個法院嗰個判決裏邊提到佢已經係做咗嘅一啲裁決，係跟嗰個做法去做。

187
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:14,540
噉啊，所以咧就誒誒之後，我哋都知道政府都即係似乎知道呢一樣嘢，嗰啲喺婚姻條例要修訂咧，可能嗰個爭議性係極大。

188
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:24,120
當然，我哋都多謝呢個工作小組啦。即係其實大家都係義工啦，咁即係都都會係誒誒喺即係一種嘅貢獻社會嘅嘅工作。但係對於政府咧，我覺得佢係責無旁貸嘅，即係誒佢唔應該話推咗一個工作就畀。

189
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:54,080
嗱，今日就誒，我唔知律政司嗰邊有冇誒，或者回答咗之前議員嘅問題，即係會唔會已經有一個時間表，定係仍然係即係觀望當中咧咁？因為頭先我喺人力嗰邊，你你知主席而家啲啲會答曬嗯嚇噉，即係可可唔可以講下佢？

190
00:34:44,650 --> 00:35:04,660
就希望立法會都成為一個橋梁。咁如果我哋即係主席都同意咧，我哋有個公聽會幫手收集意見。噉我亦都希望工作小組盡快就住收到嘅誒意見咧，就畀出一個報告，亦都即係真係要求政府去有。

191
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:32,760
發言嘅時間啦，我諗啊誒公道啲講咧，其實政府就住W案咧係提出咗婚姻條例嘅修訂嘅啊，咁咧就誒其實立法會都好積極討論咗。我諗應該如果我都參與咗嗰個委員會啦，陳志全議員都好似參與咗咧，就超過一年時間都好活躍嘅討論。

192
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:52,770
咁但係最後嗰個修訂咧，就大比例係啊否決咗。咁嗰個修訂係特別為W嗰個判決嚟做翻一個法律嘅適應嘅。但喺法律上咧，的確咧，即係誒嗰個判決裏邊咧，就啊嗰個法官係講咧，要誒立法會一年內修例，但係。

193
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,850
佢嘅經濟負擔唔起。

194
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,980
嘅政策係協助到呢一啲人咧。

195
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,740
呢個咧，其實我係一個提議嚟嘅。

196
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,940
喺喺香港，其實。

197
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,460
誒喺噉嘅情況底下。

198
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,180
佢係誒，佢話自己心理上。

199
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:19,850
每一個嘅即係性別重置手術，咁究竟即係應唔應該噉樣咧？咁於是係有啲所謂反對呢種提議嘅觀點咧，就正如好似主席頭先所講嘅，我哋會有考慮嘅，但係我哋依家未有任何立場。

200
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:45,020
The hospital authority provides very good and comprehensive. You mean public hospital? Yes. Okay. So in fact, expense normally I think in Hong Kong would not would not be an issue. Okay. Okay. Would you like to?

201
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:54,700
心理上，我已經係誒佢個樣，即係我舉例，即係個樣係女士噉，但係咧就係啊，佢係啊一位男誒誒係男仔嘅性格噉，後屘佢就變咗嗰個誒誒，佢就唔想唔想去做手術。O.K.唔想做手術有幾種原因，一個佢就唔想做啦，一個可能。

202
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:20,750
sorry喺噉嘅情況底下喺外國咧，即係我自己就都係睇新聞嘅啫，就出現過有啲人咧，人哋以為佢係男性噉啊，走咗入去女廁噉，然之後就發生好多嘅尷尬面，即係因為佢係冇做手術嘅喺某啲嘅國家，佢係容許可能手術係未做曬啦，噉佢就佢自己就認為。

203
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:40,760
自己已經係另外一個性別啦，咁咁呢啲嘅情況會唔會都係誒？你哋係咪都係考慮在內？即係呢啲所謂呢個誒性別承認咧，其實即係除咗個人之外咧，我自己都睇咧，呢個亦都有個社會性喺度嘅，即係話如果嗰個人佢唔

204
00:37:40,760 --> 00:38:00,770
唔係好清晰喺個社會或個圈裏邊，唔知佢係男士女士嘅時候，佢係走出去誒類似嘅更衣室，女士嘅更衣室噉，可能就產生好大嘅尷尬同埋誒矛盾。咁呢一方面其實，如果頭先我提到，即使立法跟即係話修例啊，跟W案例已經判咗都咁困難。

205
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:20,780
嘅時候，行政上會有啲咩嘢喺呢一方面？譬如話佢係話佢金錢冇能力負擔唔起，咁會唔會係誒經過醫生啊、誒心理、誒心理嘅測試啊？佢又符合曬其他啦，唯一就係冇錢做手術嘅，我哋會唔會話有一啲噉嘅誒行政？

206
00:38:46,060 --> 00:39:06,070
誒好，張先生係誒都都好快啦。其實頭先誒主席提嗰啲嘅觀點咧，其實都喺我哋諮詢文件裏面咧都有羅列到出嚟嘅。因為正如之前我哋一路強調咧，其實喺諮詢文件裏面咧，我哋都羅列咗咧喺好多議題啲正反嘅觀點，譬如頭先提到就係話，若果唔需要做。

207
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,750
嗯哼。

208
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,460
啊。

209
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,940
有冇出現過一啲？

210
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,020
Right through from.

211
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,170
what we have done in our

212
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,490
分析 of the overseas jurisdictions is to look at their legal positions.

213
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,920
你 know hormonal treatment, same sex reassign, a sex reassignment surgery.

214
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:09,230
咁咧就啊，另外一樣嘢咧就係我想問咧，就係話其實喺外國咧。

215
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:36,440
and it's very clear that there is, as you as you've said, different jurisdictions adopt very different approaches.

216
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:42,860
問題咧，噉我因為我頭先call咧，就係其中一啲我睇到新聞啫，嚇噉佢有啲州佢個州都，有啲州都唔同嘅喎，嚇咁呢啲你哋有有冇作出一啲比較深入啲嘅研究咧？

217
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:33,450
We can, I should reiterate that the whole approach of the IWG in preparing this paper has been to try and provide as much comprehensive information to the public.

218
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:20,340
Actually, these types of issues certainly we have been looking at as we've been proceeding, but they may also be looked at in the context of the post-recognition part of the study.

219
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:51,680
Some require only self-affirmation and a declaration that a person wishes to be identified in the opposite gender. Other jurisdictions have very strict requirements.

220
00:40:43,140 --> 00:41:02,460
即係男士嘅look啊，可能佢女士嘅心理咁誒入咗女士嘅廁所，咁女士可能特別介意呢啲嘢添啦。嗰啲有時有啲可能teenage嘅，有啲係好後生嘅嗰啲誒喺嗰個更衣室係女女士或者係一啲少女啊噉樣嘅情況。

221
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:40,140
我咧就誒睇到啦，而家好興咧就用一個形容詞咧，話係性別友善嘅廁所。我覺得咧，會唔會可以將佢改翻，就係話不分性別嘅廁所，會唔會係更加符合嗰個現實？即係性別友善咧，其實唔係講緊嗰個情況嚟嘅嚇，因為佢只不過就係話。

222
00:39:40,140 --> 00:40:00,150
唔係男性或者女性，或者嗰個人入嗰個廁格嘅時候，嗰個廁所嘅時候已經係即係佢唔介意，即係誒嗰度係咪男廁定係女廁嘅噉。譬如呢啲係一隻at their choice噉，但係我自己認為誒用嗰個term咧，用嗰個名詞話性別有限誒廁所，其實我認為唔係好恰當嘅。

223
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:29,520
即係我睇到係誒，譬如美國啊，都好多唔同嘅州啦。誒，佢有唔同嘅處處理方式。噉係誒，亦都咧有啲嘅情況係誒，唔需要做曬手術嘅嚇。咁事實上喺嗰方邊佢嗰個即係喺佢嘅社會或者誒。

224
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,190
OK，仲有冇？

225
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,970
所以，使得公眾可以有非常 informed 觀點，對什麼問題。

226
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,320
administrative measures will be looked at, as well as potential legislation.

227
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,470
Beyond that, this is certainly something which the IWG will be looking at very closely.

228
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:32,480
Well, of course, at the moment we have the the administrative measures in relation to the the Hong Kong identity card.

229
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:48,590
我唔可以comment on behalf of the government as as to what it might do, but certainly from the point of view of the IWG study.

230
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:21,510
咁亦都從而會引致咧，頭先我講，亦都會有時會有社會上喺社區上引起尷尬嘅情況出現啊！嚇～

231
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:53,060
both at the at at the transsexual persons' point of view, and from the point of view of other groups in the community that may have concerns in this area.

232
00:43:53,370 --> 00:44:12,000
第日我哋在公聽會，不過講完㗎啦，係話即係出世最好唔好幫佢揀性別。噉我唔知道係咪有呢一啲噉嘅情況。咁但係我想了解喺香港嘅情況究竟係如何？我哋係除咗話法例上有冇其他行政措施係點樣係協助緊呢啲人咯？

233
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:21,260
所以， in terms of the the social issues, that's certainly something that the I W G will will be looking at, and we hope in the course of the consultation exercise to receive views and concerns from the public on those types of issues, so that we can certainly take as as much into account as

234
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:13,350
係誒，我想問下誒誒小組啦嚇誒，可能可能會有啲數字，譬如喺香港有幾多咧？其實佢係誒，佢係自己本身唔肯唔想做。其實佢係誒，可能心理嗰個測試都做埋㗎啦，但係佢就唔想做嗰個手術，係純粹佢自己唔想做嘅。咁會唔會係其實？

235
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:33,360
數量係比較少嘅，即係我想知了解下有一啲咧係佢想做嘅，但係佢身體可能承受唔到，係唔可以做嘅。咁喺呢種情況底下，即係而家我哋通常係點樣去誒協助呢啲人，或者係誒點樣去我哋誒誒啊喺嗰個。

236
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:53,370
啊，支援上啊，嗰方面政府而一個政策其實究竟係係點樣嘅嚇？我我想了解多少些香港嗰個情況嚇。因為你頭先提到外國啦，外國嗰個就有一啲係佢話自己係邊個性別就O K。噉我聽過一啲就係話誒有啲國家啦，可能呢個。

237
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:17,500
有啊，張大明先生係補充下回應主席個問題咧，因為我哋呢個小組咧喺中間咧，我哋都會會有約見一啲嘅專家，聽佢哋嘅意見嘅。咁起碼我記憶當中咧，其實咧係喺誒，我得到即係關於呢個問題咧，就似乎咧就係對於一啲誒有性別不安嘅。

238
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,410
B B佢又用翻佢女性嘅身體去生B B，但係個樣咧又變咗男性。

239
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:17,100
咁呢個文件咧就係立法會C.B.括弧四一三八六足十六-hyphen十七括弧零三。

240
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:53,940
啲有好多樣嘢，咁亦都真係，如果係噉嘅時候，會唔會亦都真係會出現喺社區裏邊？譬如誒一齊嘅人士咧，就會出好多問題咧。

241
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:09,300
跟住咧，就係我哋落下一個議程啦。下一個議程咧，就係防止香港法律援助制度濫用嘅措施，同埋委派律師處理法律援助嘅個案。

242
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:32,480
零四同埋咧就係立法會文件C.B.括弧四一四一九足十六-hyphen十七括弧零一零二，仲有咧就係一四二二足十六-hyphen十七括弧零一。

243
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:54,510
到呢一度嚇，如果誒再冇議員係喺呢個議題發問咧，我哋可以私底下再從小組去溝通一下誒，同埋啊，我哋仲有機會。如果安排到咧，有一個公眾嘅諮詢，多謝大家，多謝多謝，Thank you, Mr. John, Thank you, Mr. Ansur。

244
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:37,510
嘅人士嚟講咧，有專家嘅睇法咧，佢哋會簡單嚟講分兩大類嘅。有一啲咧，佢係唔中意埋自己個身體嘅，即係佢覺得咧自己個身體咧錯配咗，所以其實佢本身有好強嘅意欲咧，佢係想改變自己個身體去做呢啲性別重置嘅。但係都有專家講咧，亦都係有一啲咧，佢根本佢唔係話。

245
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:57,520
唔中意嘅身體，不過佢真係好認定咧，自己係另外一個嘅性別嘅。咁所以對於後者嚟講咧，其實佢哋本身唔會話有特別有個意欲咧，就係要去做呢個性別重置手術。呢亦都係點解有一啲嘅團體或者國家佢嘅覺得咧，就唔應該將性別重置手術作為係一個嘅前先。

246
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:17,530
呢個係一個嘅論點，但係喺香港嘅情況咧，所瞭解咧就因為咧香港嘅公營系統咧，主要咧，坦白講，嚟得公立醫院去尋求呢啲幫助嗰啲人咧，都係屬於前者嗰種，因為佢哋本身係有好強嘅意欲，覺得接受唔到自己嗰個身體，所以佢係想咧係去尋求。

247
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:37,540
即係醫生可以幫佢做呢個變性手術。咁喺噉嘅情況咧，香港嘅處理咧，噉佢哋當然咧，醫生要做之前咧，噉佢咧就要經過一係列嗰個嘅評估啊，即係counseling啊，一啲所謂嘅誒，即係real life experience啊。然後咧，佢經過評估之後咧，覺得佢係適合啦。然後咧喺

248
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:57,550
公營系統咧，先至會幫佢去做嘅，即係呢個就係香港嗰種情況。所以咧，我哋聽翻香港負責嗰個專家嘅講法咧，起碼佢接觸嘅個案咧，基本上嗰啲人佢自己係好想做呢個手術，就唔係話逼佢做先至改變身份，而佢好想做。反而醫生咧就需要評估清楚，畀唔畀佢做。

249
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:17,560
係噉樣嘅情況咯。誒，可唔可以問多一點，或者下次因為我哋有公聽會，但係你可以準備下，即係會唔會誒？我哋喺誒啊新聞就會睇到其他國家有啲情況，即係佢係誒佢自己認為今日佢認為今日係就係男性噉，但係可能兩一年之後咧，佢又想刪。

250
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:42,700
噉我誒誒，第二日即係佢成日變化好大嘅嚇。咁呢一樣嘢咧，就係真係頭先我講，亦都其實因為呢樣嘢就唔係一個個人嘅問題，唔單單係個人問題。其實因為喺社會裏邊相處，就係佢真係會分男性、女性。有時啲洗手間啊、更衣室啊，同埋你。

251
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:15,140
誒香港有冇噉嘅個案嗱？我諗我哋喺我哋諮詢文件裏面，我哋討論嘅時候咧，都從來個經驗咧，的確係有部分咧，佢哋係會有逆轉，即係嗰種嘅情況嘅，即係成噉。所以我喺諮詢文件裏面咧，我哋羅列一啲嘅所謂正反意見啊，考慮嘅意見咧，其中。

252
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:35,150
一點咧都係希望睇下公眾就呢方面咧，因為有啲國家正正係咪噉樣咧，所以佢咧就需要其中一個嘅所謂承認嘅準則咧，就係要證明到去到地步，你根本唔可能逆轉嘅啦，唔可能逆轉。譬如舉個例，有啲國家咪採取就係需要你係要完成咗嗰個性別重置手術，你唔可。

253
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,440
嗯。

254
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,960
級罰款即係一萬蚊啦，同埋監禁咧六個月。

255
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,880
防止香港法律援助制度不被。

256
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,440
誒被不被濫用或者不當使用嘅措施。

257
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,490
同埋個案，咁咧就係啊，大家亦都可以係睇多少少就係零三號文件啦。

258
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:31,060
複雜嘅法律爭議問題咧，法援處都可以根據條例第九D條咧，就審批有關嘅申請理據咧，向執業大律師咧徵詢咧獨立嘅法律意見。

259
00:51:47,400 --> 00:52:00,660
必須同時通過法律援助條例規定下邊嘅經濟審查同埋案情審查。法援處目前咧係透過普通法律援助計劃同埋法律援助附助計劃咧，向合資格人士咧提供法援。

260
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:46,360
第二方面咧就監察嗰邊啦，透過批出只限於進行某一啲工作範疇或者法律程序步驟嘅發換證書咧，去確保個案咧依然係有充分理據咧，先至可以繼續法律程序。否則咧，發換處係會取消證書。

261
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:25,770
第二咧就係如果受助人作出虛假陳述，或者故意不披露佢嘅財政資源或者案情嘅重要事實、文件或者資料等等咧，法援處係可以撤回佢嘅法援證書，亦都可以向佢追討咧所有已經繳付或者需要繳付嘅仲費。

262
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:41,760
此外咧，根據發還規則第十一條，任何人士咧，如果重複申請發還被拒，而發還處處長係覺得佢嘅行為構成濫用條規例提供嘅協助咧，處長係可以命令佢喺三年內不於考慮呢位人士提出嘅任何申請。

263
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:27,110
咁咧就啊，我哋先請李伯全先生入。啊，好，唔該主席。誒呢一份文件咧，其實向委員咧簡單介紹咧法援處防止不當使用法援制度嘅措施，同埋咧委派私人執業律師處理法律援助個案嘅制度。

264
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:21,520
法援處處理司法複核申請所採用嘅案情審查準則咧，同其他民事法援申請係相同，即係根據條例第十三條所定啦。法援咧只係會批予咧能顯示案件有合理理據進行司法複核法律程序嘅申請人。

265
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:55,160
再逆轉，佢先至會接受咯。但有啲國家咧就唔係噉樣嘅做法嘅，咁所以喺呢一個議題方面咧，我哋諮詢文件咧，我哋只不過正如頭先誒秘秘書嗰邊講咧，即係話我哋盡量希望係提供多啲資料畀公眾咧，從諮詢文件可以睇得到咧，係兩邊唔同一啲嘅意見同埋一啲嘅。

266
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:15,170
嘅資料等公眾可以畀到一個有依據嘅一個嘅回應畀我哋，等我哋方便我哋決定下一步係點樣做咧。好啊，噉我哋多謝小組嘅誒嚟臨同我哋講解下呢一個諮詢嘅文件啦。我諗而家香港嚟講就係用個標準咧，即係W。

267
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:35,180
案嗰度都講得比較清楚嘅嚇，即係係要符合咗嗰啲嘅條件，亦都係現時嚟講都仲係係一個不可逆轉嘅情況咧，先至係可以作為完全係啊啊變咗另外一個性別嘅人士去生活嘅。噉我諗咧就誒，今日我諗係咪大家大概去？

268
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:52,860
律師會提交嘅意見嚇，仲有就係C B括弧四一四二七足十六-hi分十七括弧零一係一個叫Justice Centre Hong Kong提交嘅意見。咁而家我哋先請咧就民政事務局副秘書長李伯全先生介紹有關。

269
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:47,400
法援服務咧係香港法律制度重要嘅一環，喺維護香港嘅法治咧入邊咧係扮演住重要嘅角色。法援嘅政策目標咧係國庫咧所有合具備合理理據喺香港法院提出訴訟或者抗辯嘅人咧，唔會因為缺乏經濟能力而無辦法尋求公義。任何人士咧如果希望得到法援，

270
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:21,100
法援處咧，其實係有既定嘅機制咧，防止不當使用法律法援服務，包括咗咧。第一咧就係審批方面啦，為咗確保咧只有具合理理據嘅申請先至會獲得批准法援咧，所有法援申請都係需要受聘於法援處嘅法援律師，根據條例咧去進行案情審查。如果申請涉及，

271
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,270
係冇出現不當行為或者無故拖延嘅情況。

272
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,600
咧可能討回嘅任何損害賠償、財產或者仲費。

273
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,850
法援署已經通知咗兩個法律專業團體，亦都計劃喺今年第四季咧實施新個案數目上限。

274
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:15,160
另外咧，法援處亦都發出咗法律援助律師手冊，就點樣去進行法援個案咧，定立呢個指引。

275
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:26,470
政府咧一直透過唔同途徑咧加強宣傳教育，包括咗提示市民咧切勿不當使用發換。

276
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:10,090
過去三年咧，喺名冊入邊，律師辦理法援個案時候出現不當行為，法援處咧總共係發出咗六封勸戒信。

277
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:07,930
律師辦理發還個案嘅準則，經法律援助服務局通過，亦都上載咗去咧發還處嘅網頁，供大家查閲。

278
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:18,930
喺工作表現同埋行為操守欠佳記錄冊入邊咧，亦都曾經作出記錄三十二次，並且咧將三名律師咧喺名冊中除名。

279
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:07,120
法援處咧最近亦都完成咗一個個案數目上限嘅檢討，亦都得到咧法援局嘅同意咧調整有關嘅上限。詳情咧大家可以睇翻文件嘅第十八段嘅列表。

280
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:27,070
當受助人咧按照條例第十三條規定自行提名律師咧，法援處認為署方係應該重視有關嘅提名，除非咧又有令人信服嘅理由，否則唔應該拒絕提名。

281
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:39,480
如果法援處認為受助人提名嘅律師並唔係適當嘅人選，又或者嗰個律師咧所接辦嘅個案數目已經超出上限咧，法援處係會邀請受助人喺名冊入邊咧提名另一位律師嘅。

282
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:56,480
喺二零一三年開始咧，法援處已經逐步加緊執行定明喺法律援助律師手冊入邊嗰個個案數目上限。目前咧，嚴格執行派位個案上限嘅做法咧，已經包括咗所有類別嘅民事、刑事案件。

283
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:38,250
過去三個財政年度咧，獲批發還嘅司法複核個案所涉及嘅法律費用咧嘅支出佔咧發還費用總額咧大概百分之四至六五。過去三年咧，民事案件嘅整體勝訴比率咧維持住喺百分之八十八至到九十一之間。

284
00:52:46,940 --> 00:53:06,950
第三方面咧就係防止濫用法援方面條例同埋佢嘅附屬法例入邊咧係定有防止濫用法援嘅機制同埋呢個罰則，當中係包括咧任何尋求或者接受法援嘅人，如果喺提供資料嘅時候明知而作出任何虛假陳述咧，都係犯罪嘅。如果經定罪後咧係可以處第三。

285
00:53:42,090 --> 00:54:02,100
法援處咧一直都係密切留意咧，係咪有不當使用法援嘅情況，亦都喺有需要嘅時候咧採取跟進行動。過去三年咧，法援處總共撤回八十四張法援證書，亦都將七十一宗取消或者撤回證書嘅個案咧轉介係警方跟進。過去三年咧被定罪嘅個案咧總共係有八宗。

286
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:59,620
有關委派律師處理法援個案方面咧，條例第十三條定明，法援處處長係可以透過署內法援律師為受助人行事，亦都可以指派咧由處長或者受助人喺法律援助律師名冊入邊咧去挑選私人執業律師。法援處咧制定咗委派外委。

287
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,390
嗯。

288
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,220
The.

289
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,980
是， that。

290
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,180
Yes, Mr. Chris. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.

291
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:03,170
Mr. Beretta sends his apologies for not being here today.

292
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:52,670
所以，the point that we want to make, so far as the judicial review cases are concerned.

293
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,590
所以你可見，在due course，當我們看圖表，他們有幾好結果。

294
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:12,490
Question has arisen because of alleged misuse of the legal aid system. I can summarise that.

295
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:19,870
The bar association is very satisfied overall with the way in which the legal aid prevents misuse.

296
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:54,430
住咧，我就先請香港大律師公會嘅代表Mr.NicholasPerry係啊發言嘅，OK。

297
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:13,430
Legal aid department often takes the view that legal aid should only be granted when leave has already been given by a judge.

298
00:58:54,470 --> 00:59:03,360
律師局部門 often is not involved at all in the preparation of the judicial review case, because the.

299
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:40,820
really reflects also on the work of the independent lawyers who work pro bono to obtain leave for would-be applicants. So there is very little abuse.

300
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:29,580
所以， consequently， this is the system that has been adopted， and that you can see from the numbers， the effectiveness in the of legal aid in the judicial review cases has been quite high， and that.

301
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:39,500
But what you should realise is that in many cases, legal aid is only in fact the second stage of a person's consultation, because more and more persons seek pro bono advice first before going along to the legal aid department.

302
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:34,240
為咗打擊咧，不當兜攬同或者係包攬訴訟嘅活動咧，法援處喺諮詢法援局同埋兩個法律專業團體後咧，喺二零一三年九月為法援申請個案引入申報制度，去確保受助人咧係按其意願去提名律師，而且咧係冇任任何人咧達成協議攤分喺法律程序入邊。

303
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:59,050
另外咧，法援處都有既定嘅制度咧，去監察外委律師嘅工作表現，包括咧由處長擔任主席嘅部門監察委員會去評核咧外委律師辦理法援個案入邊嘅工作表現。並且咧由首長級人員咧定期檢討所有委派嘅個案，確保咧有關律師喺辦理法援個案嘅時候咧係。

304
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:46,760
法援處咧每年都會舉辦同埋參與咧唔同嘅活動，致力推廣法援活動咧服務咧，同埋增加咧公眾對法援服務嘅瞭解。法援處未來係會繼續佢嘅監察工作，誒加強公眾教育。就住文件嘅詳情咧，我同埋法援處處長咧係樂意就委員嘅提問咧作出回應嘅。多謝主席。好咁跟。

305
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,440
The complaint.

306
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,490
merit some further inquiry.

307
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,770
This really is a.

308
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,100
到The FCC。

309
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,180
所以有個上昇 in 數字。

310
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,990
在意見， of this committee。

311
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,580
and in two thousand and sixteen, a hundred and forty four.

312
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:43,230
所以，但係，雖然總數個數量申請有上升。

313
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:30,170
again, you can see in 2014 other judicial review cases.

314
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,700
I think arises after certain retired judges' comments were made.

315
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:37,730
There was a grant rate of 13%，that's dropped 6.15% in 2016。

316
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:04,520
far from there being abuse, you can see the grant rate has dropped dramatically from fifty three per cent to six point two five per cent.

317
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:49,600
And you can see that in 2014 there were 98 applications, 2015 248 applications.

318
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:17,510
和純粹在數碼基礎，Mr. Thomas Kwong的部門，可難以被批評。在事實上，批評可能反過來，因為快速下跌可能。

319
00:59:42,490 --> 01:00:01,890
I think the legal aid department has been very good in recognising that judicial review applications are at the cutting edge of the law. They involve your rights and my rights, and it's an important example of how funds, government funds, are used in the public interest, and we support that process.

320
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:34,680
但這 arises not because of the fault of the legal aid department. It arises because the immigration department did not get to grips with large numbers of immigrants. I think nine, ten thousand immigrants who were not properly processed to see whether or not they could stay in Hong Kong.

321
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,430
所以。

322
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,330
Shown to the public.

323
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,880
favorably, the League like

324
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,430
和律 legal aid department of

325
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,810
一個不適當的批評。

326
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,890
We would like to comment and.

327
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,910
We would ask this panel to.

328
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,780
and miscellaneous is about fifty six percent.

329
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:56,160
About the reasons for grant withdrawal or otherwise.

330
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:25,020
醫療和 dental， the case average is about seventy one percent over the last three years.

331
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:19,330
success rate is very high. PI cases, very few fail. Mostly, ninety percent win.

332
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:11,160
get the Home Affairs Department and the Legal Aid Department to look into the cases where there's been a lot of preparation pro bono.

333
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:49,780
所以，唯一figures we don't really know about is legal aid appeals， because at the moment there are no open figures which are

334
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:21,630
and consider amending the terms of the guidance notes given to solicitors and barristers when they take on legal aid's defence because.

335
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:39,340
And these are very reasonable figures, bearing in mind the relatively low threshold for grant of legal aid set in Section 103.

336
01:01:52,710 --> 01:02:05,880
Obviously, have once they've granted cases, these are throughput, and so there's been a very slight increase in the percentage of the legal aid budget to cover those cases. It's up from four to five percent.

337
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,440
of lawyers.

338
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,570
是reasonable，necessary。

339
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,910
retrospective work.

340
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,960
第二個 aspect， we want to look at is assignment.

341
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:34,280
This is particularly so, in.

342
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,480
legal aid certificate cannot cover currently.

343
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,980
medical and dental cases. Those are things that I'm involved in currently.

344
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:45,210
一 lot of work has to be put in, often where a legal aid certificate is initially refused.

345
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:18,100
on a proper basis, and our system should not be limping along on pro bono basis.

346
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,690
And it's a bit unfortunate that we have this great emphasis here on currently on pro bono.

347
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:04,190
我cannot stress too highly that many lawyers take, and we have some lawyers here sitting.

348
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:46,340
所以，我們在段落五結論，一個彈性系統的回溯性付款，為專業工作。

349
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:11,610
In the panel, taken seven years or more to qualify, and they expect to be paid.

350
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:56,030
There's a master's appeal and so forth, so that that process is not covered at all in the costing of this system.

351
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:31,880
When you go to a public hospital, you don't expect to be seen by a pro bono person. You expect to be seen by and received by an experienced emergency department team.

352
01:04:50,210 --> 01:05:04,020
我們也認為，法律援助系統需要被保持更新，以確保有持續的司法接觸，以及我們的普通法系統對香港下一代公民的益處得以延續。

353
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,300
response。

354
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,860
The.

355
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,320
所以。

356
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,790
and we think that.

357
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,380
所以，我們認為。

358
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,130
因為他們會被 able to set a standard fee.

359
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,330
And it's not very cost-effective.

360
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,940
They actually say we have informed them.

361
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:27,510
And those those block allocations are conducted in in other countries.

362
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,980
and cutting crude across the board limits is not a proper.

363
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:59,880
The legal aid department and its supervisory bodies should be looking at the quality of work.

364
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:33,350
and therefore this would save the legal aid department and the legal aid system considerably.

365
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:48,100
We don't really know what the factual basis is for the adjustment.

366
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:22,200
They should perhaps instead be looking at block allocation of legal aid in regular cases.

367
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:26,800
我係在實務做咗40年，呢度，有幾次重複嘅批評同説謊，大部份都係無根據嘅。而ICAC都參與咗，我認為至少有三次。睇下案件係點分配嘅。

368
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:47,560
The Bar Association and I think the Law Society don't think that altering the limits on cases or payment is not the correct way forward. And the Legal Aid Services Council and neither the Legal Aid Services Council nor the Home Affairs Bureau has actually consulted. If you look at the words in their paper.

369
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,630
and。

370
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,560
to。

371
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,380
在那些 areas， the

372
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:39,100
Home Affairs Department must be careful not.

373
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,770
另一點，which the Home Affairs Bureau is not aware of is that.

374
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:19,600
And this is a major omission in their discussion in paragraph 19.

375
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:06,060
If there's a logical basis on which just to adjust numbers.

376
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:53,790
Mr. Kong can give better examples than I can, but I've recently been approached.

377
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,210
discourages solicitors and barristers from taking those cases because of the legal aid delay in taxation.

378
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:30,220
但，他們已經assigning cases on a class basis to individual law firms and barristers for years.

379
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:29,790
Further, there's no account taken of the specialist nature of the legal aid practice in certain areas of practice.

380
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:22,860
In fact, we now have and have had for many years class actions. Mr. Quan will can be able to confirm that, perhaps not over such a long memory period of mine.

381
01:07:48,430 --> 01:08:01,340
In all those cases, we know that a large number of cases have been assigned to one or two firms to handle, and barristers to handle those cases, and it makes sense to do so.

382
01:06:48,380 --> 01:07:01,300
Is it just a knee-jerk reaction to public criticism or assumed public criticism, and they've just said, oh well, we better cut the numbers. We just don't know whether that what the logical

383
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:15,110
In those cases, I know personally that the High Court has given class action directions in the past. So the Home Affairs Department are just not aware of how this system has operated flexibly.

384
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:47,880
白喉病例、HIV/AIDS、血 transfusion 案例、SARS、more recently，雪隆災難病例、KMB巴士事故、在雙城飛機、CPEL Marco 火、Top One 酒吧火。

385
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,540
啊！要。

386
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,680
所以，我們認為。

387
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,890
在我的實際經驗。

388
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,350
That I work in, and that will also increase delays.

389
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:40,120
dealt with in the same way as contractors under the building ordinance.

390
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,860
它會也 duplicat work，特別係醫療過失案件。

391
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:57,510
Section nine opinions, I'd like to move on to, and I think this is a very important matter.

392
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:39,340
very considerable delays if the case has to be considered by another barrister later.

393
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:04,350
A Section 9 opinion is given, and they want to change the rules so that.

394
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:46,720
This happens in masters appeals, and also where senior counsels advise, possibly.

395
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:12,350
The council who's given an earlier favourable opinion will not be assigned to handle the case if legal aid is subsequently granted.

396
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:24,120
這，這，較為反映得不好於行當，無足考慮。

397
01:10:50,420 --> 01:11:01,600
This is inappropriate, and if they have a question about the validity of a section nine opinion, then they can always ask another barrister to review it.

398
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:51,860
It's not very good news to hear that lawyers are not being treated fairly and openly. I don't need to say any more about that, but that should be reconsidered.

399
01:08:54,110 --> 01:09:14,120
as to whether I would waive my fee in a legal aid taxation, which was held 16 the cases I worked on was 16 years ago. Okay, Mr. Berry. So sorry, I may only give you three minutes so that the other members of the panel may follow.

400
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:35,830
Opinions, as well as we can have more time to question the Department of Legal Aid. Thank you. Can I just go quickly on to the Departmental Monitoring Committee? This is the first time we've heard about it. And if barristers and solicitors are to be taken off the list, then they ought to be allowed a hearing.

401
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,190
誒。

402
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,770
The wrong numbers are being used, basically.

403
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,190
reject that proposal.

404
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,880
所以我們會， invite this panel to to.

405
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,780
barristers don't cost their services in relation to the cost of charcoal.

406
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:12,450
用你哋自己署長嘅呢組權力去拒絕呢啲發還嘅司法覆核嘅申請咧？

407
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:50,790
或煤油在公共屋苑，和那些是CPI指數，他們用。

408
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:21,660
Madam Chairman, you've kindly written to us to to say that you will hold a hearing after the summer recess as to the financial eligibility problem.

409
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:33,720
And no doubt, the departments concerned will be able to respond to our quite serious criticisms as to what has happened hitherto since 2000.

410
01:11:51,200 --> 01:12:04,890
That is all we wish to say, Madam Chairman. Okay, thank you, Mr. Perry. 啊，而家咧就係委員發問嘅時間。咁有兩位舉咗手嘅係許志峯同埋啊楊嶽橋議員，仲有冇係就呢個問題好？

411
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:26,560
係，何君瑤議員同埋我，首先係阿誒許志峯議員，我諗畀四分鐘啊，嚇連問連答，儘量爭取精簡。政府文件咧第十點就提到濫用法援嗰個情況啦，噉就話法援條例嘅十一條咧就署長可以命令有啲濫用法援嘅人，就命令佢哋咧最長三年咧都。

412
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:46,570
唔可以提出任何申請嘅啦嗱。誒，我就關注濫用嘅情況咧，就唔係話有啲人即係虛報自己嘅入息啊，或者財產啊等等。反而我係留意到社會上面有啲人咧，誒，無論基於佢對法律嘅興趣，或者係對社會公義嘅追求等等，佢係提出咗唔少嘅係。

413
01:12:46,570 --> 01:13:06,580
誒司法複核嘅個案去挑戰政府，噉我過往見到咧係誒法援署就會用第法援條例第十一條對呢啲人話：你睇得太多啦，即係我就三年內都唔禁止你嘅申請啦。嗱，所以當如果有啲人申請好多嘅司法複核個案，

414
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:27,070
對你哋嚟講咧，即係可能係行政嘅成本啦，即係你哋做慢咗。但係對市民嚟講咧，佢哋係即係剝奪咗佢可以透過法律嘅途徑去取得呢個社會公義嘅，即係佢哋嘅途徑嚟嘅。咁所以呢個情況咧，係我反而係擔心，究竟係誒市民攬。

415
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:47,080
濫用咗發緩嗰個係制度，誒定係政府部門咧濫用咗自己係喺發緩條例第十一條嗰度嘅嘅酌情權去禁止佢哋申請發緩，咁呢個情況係好令人擔心，尤其是係我哋見到即係政府帶頭將政治。

416
01:13:47,080 --> 01:14:07,090
嘅問題係用法律解決，市民都會有同樣嘅誒理由或者同樣嘅道理，即係將呢啲嘅問題咧，係用司法複核嘅機機制去解決。但係如果你禁止佢哋嘅話咧，噉就佢哋就處一個好弱勢。噉你可唔可以講下公眾或者我哋議會點樣監察你？即係等你哋唔好攬。

417
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,130
係，康處長。

418
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,660
對準呢個麥好唔好啊？

419
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,030
如果你講話類似，

420
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:34,810
即即係類似呢啲case嚟講咧啊！第一，就算佢啊可以。

421
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:55,390
嗰個法例係講得好清楚，係有一個上訴嘅權。噉我哋亦過去都見過。

422
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:15,500
個咧有一點，我覺得好重要嘅咧，大家要明白，唔需要擔心啊，會唔會係法律援助處濫用呢個權咧？就係。

423
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:47,510
嗯，首先咧就個法律援助條例咧喺Regulation十一嗰度講到好清楚咧，就係話如果同一個申請人佢申請，

424
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:26,380
拒絕咗佢啦嘛，同埋嗰啲個案咧，類似即係市民複合王嗰啲個案咧，有幾多嗰啲數字？我哋點樣監察？你可唔可以畀翻我議會咧？係，控制咗。啊，嗯。

425
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:48,670
我唔可以透露裡面嗰啲資料嘅，嚇呢個我係係做唔到嘅，係我哋做某一樣嘢係有一個理由嘅。咁不過咧，就我想即係再強調一樣嘢咧，就係話。

426
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:38,550
多謝主席，同埋多謝啊，議員嘅問題。嗯，首先咧，我諗，如果我哋講緊咧，可能係最近某一個個案咧係特別多出傳媒報導啦。噉我相信喺呢度係唔方便，即係去評論某一個案件嘅。咁因為呢個案件遲啲可能都會進入呢個司法程序嘅，大家都知道呢個。

427
01:14:47,790 --> 01:15:07,800
同一件事超過兩次，或者喺唔同類別嘅案件超過四次，咁如果佢個啊佢個啊，即係佢個做法咧，係構成呢一個啊濫用呢個法律援助啦，咁法律援助處長係有呢個權去即係出一個命令禁止佢申請三年嗱，不過。

428
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:35,790
喺法律援助條例，每一個決定處長嘅決定咧，係有一個上訴嘅渠道嚟嘅。所以最終嚟講咧，係司法常務官、高等法院司法常務官作嗰個最終個決定咧，先至係即係為最終嘅。即係如果大家有個擔心啊，會唔會法援處嗱喺呢個個案頭先我講過。

429
01:15:55,670 --> 01:16:15,680
人曾經有啲例子咧，就算司法上無官作一個最終嘅決定咧，都可以被司法複核去到呢一個高等法院嗰度再去睇多一次嘅。所以呢個唔需要擔心。我想爭取啲時間追問咧，就係即使佢哋有上訴嘅權，佢哋上訴你就以司法複核處長嘅決定，噉佢哋邊度揾錢打官司咧？因為你已經佢。

430
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:55,100
啊！就算可以上訴咧，其實佢亦可以一樣申請法律援助嚟上訴嘅個決定，唔係話唔可以。我哋有試過嘅過去，我哋去攞獨立嘅大律師意見嚟睇嘅，即係有講緊一個司法複核，即係個司法上無關嘅決定。如果係話法援處個做法係啱嘅，我第一樣係可以攞啲。

431
01:16:55,100 --> 01:17:15,110
個獨立嘅決定嘅可以幫佢，所以即係我諗呢個啊啊，我相信大家唔需要擔心嚇。好，誒第二位係阿楊嶽橋議員。多謝主席，主席，我係睇到咧文件嘅第七段，我都係對住嗰啲數字咧，我想進一步請即係處長可唔可以？

432
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:35,120
而去展釋一下嘅誒上喺民事法援下面上訴推翻處長的決定咧，我哋見到兩組數字啦。經凌信嘅上訴同埋上訴得直噉，我哋就睇得到咧。上訴得直咧比起經凌信嘅上訴嗰個數字個百分比係好低下嘅。

433
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:27,240
冇嘅話咧，就係阿何君瑤議員。

434
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,330
咧，其實係唔包括在內嘅，噉。

435
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,610
即係誒，展述即係主席，唔該。好，誒有冇補充？

436
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:23,280
大家如果冇啊，噉我就叫下一位議員咯喎，係嘛？有冇兩位？

437
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,020
誒發緩嘅制度咧，係追翻上時代。我哋又冇cross section。

438
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:21,540
啦，咁不過照我所知嚟講咧，就係個數目，如果係講緊司法覆核嗰啲咧，就唔多。

439
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:55,130
噉我想即係誒就民事發還嗰度，我想了解下經凌訊嘅上訴有冇一個誒break down，即係例如係誒有幾多係屬於司法複核嘅咧？有幾多係司法複核以外嘅民事案件？同埋誒上訴得直嗰啲案件有冇？

440
01:17:55,130 --> 01:18:15,140
同類型嘅一個數字，等我哋有個進一步嘅認知咧，主席。好，康處長。誒誒，多謝主席多一樣嘢嘅問題。誒，我而家就冇嗰個數字喺度，即係話將佢分開唔同嘅嘅類別。誒，即係係佔邊即係邊一類嘅案件。

441
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:41,910
嚇唔多呢一個即係上訴我哋嗰個決定。第二咧話上訴得席咧都唔多，照我印象啊。不過我可以或者會後補係啊，會後補充，好冇係啊，喬醫生。主席，我唔係係啦，我都多謝處長，即係之後補翻就得㗎啦。我唔需要喺度急於要呢個數字嘅。咁亦都多謝處長，剛才亦都好清晰咁講咧喺。

442
01:18:41,910 --> 01:19:01,920
上經凌信嘅上訴嘅嗰嗰組數字牽涉到司法複核嘅，唔係一個即係誒overwhelming嘅比率，即係呢個係處長嘅意思係咪？我想理解清楚啫，啱嘅。咁所以如果咁咧，誒，我相信近年坊間即係對於濫用法援嘅。

443
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:24,100
説法咧，誒，我覺得係站不住腳嘅。我亦都覺得即係，甚至其實咧，我覺得法援係不足。添主席，即係當然呢個未必牽涉到處長啦，呢個牽涉到政府一個政策嘅問題，因為喺現階段，正如大律師公會都指出，我哋好多誒相關嘅訴訟。

444
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:47,800
即係例如小業主過律法團都唔包，其實係好痛苦嘅一個事情嚟嘅。咁所以我借呢個機會，亦都希望誒，即係今日民政處民政局有誒政府官員喺度啦，亦都希望可以借呢個機會反映翻咧。其實我哋需要嘅係加快將我哋而家。

445
01:19:53,310 --> 01:20:13,320
咁conditional fee，我哋而家都唔知等幾耐，主席噉，所以等等呢一啲咧，對於我哋係畀市民得到公義嘅途徑咧，其實而家就只有得發緩噉，而發緩喺咁侷限嘅情況底下咧，其實我哋香港的而且確係好落後嘅。我係想作呢一方面嘅。

446
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:48,010
多謝主席，我想誒同啊處長詢問下咧，你喺第十一段裏邊咧就帶出咗三套嘅數字，一四至到一七年噉樣。咁每年我都睇到有遞增，就以係司法複核嘅總銀碼嚟講咧，我哋睇到有上升。我知你可唔可以咧誒話畀我哋聽誒？

447
01:20:48,010 --> 01:21:08,020
一般嚟就講誒，如果你如果有手頭上嘅數字，話畀我聽。如果唔係咧，就可以後補都唔怕，好唔好？譬如好似以一六一七年嚟講，我哋花三千六百萬做司法複核誒，嗰度涉及咗有幾多單嘅私誒誒，即係J R嘅案件咧？咁如果係的話誒。

448
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,020
批出嘅錢。

449
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,380
喺邊位可以幫到手？

450
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,810
呢一種嘅誒。

451
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:52,210
一個人頭啦，好唔好啊？噉我哋第二個問題就係。

452
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:28,750
啊，多謝主席，啊，多謝佢嘅問題，噉就啊。

453
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:32,780
更多啲咁多。如果你嘅手頭上有資料，就可以提供噉樣後補都得啊！多謝。係，唐處長。

454
01:23:52,490 --> 01:24:06,050
喺同其他歐洲同埋係東南亞國家或者亞洲區，我哋使呢條數係合理定唔合理啊？我知道咧，我哋冇cap㗎，使呢個A條數冇cap，喺社會裏邊有需要我哋就畀，但係慣常嚟講你。

455
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:22,260
都有成七億幾，唔計個administrative同埋staff嘅嘅嗰個嗰個payroll，咁所以呢條數即係有冇話限制咧？我知道你冇嘅，咁所以呢個呢點就或者你可以告知本會好嘛？多謝副秘書長同埋處長。

456
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:28,170
percent咧呢條數唔係少，因為我哋講緊成誒成過誒誒誒以萬幾宗嘅案件嚟講，我哋批覆咗差唔多有成誒五十二個percent，都有成八千單案件。以八千單嚟講，剛才我講話嗰數字。

457
01:21:48,320 --> 01:22:05,790
咁所以我就想知道，佔喺呢個整體嘅JR數字裏邊，我哋誒發還咧，實際上以呢個三千六百萬係講緊有幾多單案件？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題咧，就我想講嗰個附件B嗰度，誒B嗰度咧就係有個誒。

458
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:52,260
有問題就誒，而家我手頭上我就真係冇嗰個資料咧，即係話講個breakdown，即係嗰個喺二零一六年、一七年嗰個三十六點三million嗰個使費係牽涉幾多單、幾多宗呢一個啊司法覆核嘅案件嘅。

459
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:28,310
同樣嘅申請人嗰個嗰個重複嘅次數啊，或者以往嚟講係咪慣常申請嘅，有冇呢啲噉嘅數據畀我哋可以參考下？啊，當然我有知道有啲可能會case sensitive啦嚇，處理緊做做上訴或者係有關嘅過程當中噉，但係就誒告知我哋誒，起碼一。

460
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:48,320
般嘅數字，等我知道而家使緊我哋三千六百萬，已佔咗全年嘅經費五個percent。呢度其實係講緊幾多單啊J R，因為我按照第二就係瞭解到，每年而家平均咧J R案件咧都有一百二十至到一百五十不等。視乎睇下嗰年有幾旺嘅啫。

461
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:26,300
B嘅表咧，誒，我哋亦都睇到即係大狀師十名頭十名大狀師所處理嘅嗰個案件嘅數目誒，被分配落去噉樣。咁嗱，呢一度裏邊又有幾多係J.R.噉，我就想了解多啲，因為啱啱剛才兩位議員都好關心J.R.嘅，噉我亦都喺呢一方面嚟講係跟進。

462
01:22:52,590 --> 01:23:12,600
嗯，咁呢個可能我要後補翻，即係攞翻呢個資料出嚟。多謝多謝啊，處長嗱。第二咧就誒，主席我都想跟上個問題。站喺現時呢一個數字嚟講咧，以全年嘅legal aid嘅數字所使嘅錢係五個percent。咁唔好忘記legal誒誒，即係J.R.嚟講五個percent。

463
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:48,750
J.R.都係得個百幾，但係佢已經佔嗰個嗰個使費嚟講五個percent就相當係係合理。當然有另一個問題就話究竟我哋整體香港應唔應該使多啲喺喺Legal A方面嚟講嘅錢，以per capita計數七百二十萬人使億幾元啱唔啱咧？咁咁以平均數嚟講，我哋一百蚊當。

464
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:49,040
啱呢個啱嘅，香港嘅法律援助嗰個，我哋係冇一個上限喺個cap嗰度嘅。不過頭先我諗有一點，我可能要補充翻咧，就係話，當然嗰個費用，我哋使出嗰個即係個綜費咧，喺呢個司法覆核咧係大約啊三三三千六百萬到咯。咁不過其實咧，而家。

465
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,390
好。

466
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,000
等等嘅問題。

467
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,280
個鋪裏邊咧，就大家就係。

468
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,160
係一個基本法嘅問題，佢攞唔到法援嘅。

469
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:43,680
係咪成日法律誒濫用法律援助咧？咁相信都梗係會同個別嘅司法複核嘅案件啊噉樣會有關啦，因為嗰啲案件可能有牽涉到誒工程啊或者其他，又影響到其他嘅持份者。

470
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:43,980
你又可以講從佢嘅業務上就睇彩數，同工作嚟講咧就係一個公平性，就係呢啲係大家就輪住。而咧喺服務法律援助，佢肯掛名喺法律援助去協助嘅咧。

471
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:42,420
所噉樣即係其實調翻轉頭咧，係用更專業嘅一啲誒全職嘅律師去幫下。即係而家喺民間唔包括喺你可以再繼續落去打官司嘅嗰個支援嘅範圍。頭先有同事講係法團啊，或者強拍啊，仲有好多其他嘅。

472
01:24:49,040 --> 01:25:08,010
我講緊係嗰個使出嗰個費用噉，我哋其實有差唔多接近七成嘅案件咧，我哋係成功嘅。咁不過當然啦，大家都明白咧，呢個始終都係政府㗎啦。雙方變就算我哋贏咗嘅，咁對方都係律政司，咁其實都係政府個使費嚇。不過如果講係個勝數嚟講，我哋都佔七成嘅嚇。

473
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:29,680
啊，跟住咧就係我嘅問題啦。啊，首先咧係誒，我哋誒係上一格其實係問過曾德成局長嘅啊。當時佢係啊口頭嘅回應好清楚，就係冇一個上限嘅。其實香港喺法律援助嗰個支出噉，但係點解坊間有咁多嘅印象就係話喂，而家點解會誒？

474
01:25:44,060 --> 01:26:04,070
但係咧，我今日想問嘅問題咧就係誒，其實我係同意咧誒。如果去到講好質素嘅，即係誒法律嘅援助誒喺一啲公眾裏邊，佢係冇能力去攞到法律公義，因為冇錢打官司咧。我覺得咧，第一我哋嘅範圍咧係值得有。

475
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:24,080
有檢討嘅必要嘅，係講真咧，pro bono即係話免費去做法律諮詢咧，我哋個個立法會議員起碼，我諗有法律界背景都做好多㗎啦。噉啊，其實嗰個民間嘅嘅誒需要係好大嘅，但係咧，你哋亦都可以咧係好似或者你諗下，你哋喺法律援助處會唔係一個好似法律診？

476
01:26:44,640 --> 01:27:04,650
sorry呢個第一點，第二點咧就係誒，其實我哋反為一直就想提出會唔會可以考慮咧，為咗呢一種大家互即係指責啊，為你法律援助處就偏心嘅，來來去去都係畀誒嗰啲嘅律師嘅，以致到咧就係佢哋可能亦都揾啲熟。

477
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:24,660
啲嘅貧窮啲嘅公共屋邨啊，噉佢又可以做一個大案啊噉。所以頭先啊何君瑤議員問NXP嗰度咧，你三二一咧嗰個數咧，其實噉樣畀我哋就唔係好啱嘅。應該你畀實質上佢嗰個做三個case究竟係講緊係其實佢其實你畀佢嘅律師費係幾多？可能由一嗰個先係添埋。

478
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:44,670
數字三嗰個可能係好少，即係你係要好實際嘅咁嗰個先至係會畀人睇到你係咪一個誒係一個所謂公平性啦。嗱呢一個問題，我係幫唔少嘅律師問嘅喺我一進入立法會，佢哋已經希望我幫佢問呢個問題，就係話咧喺嗰個所謂律師嘅分配啦，會唔會咧？你係

479
01:27:44,670 --> 01:28:04,680
有唔同嘅律師，其實大家都知道佢專長啲乜嘢案件。誒大狀咧，亦都係噉。而家大家好擔憂嘅就係話誒法律換錯。誒第一頭先你講啦，你成日都去外聘嘅，我知嘅，因為我都幫過一個同事啊，法律教授添嚇。噉佢都因為外聘律師唔肯，噉佢啊，佢係一個誒。

480
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,450
六六個percent。

481
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:29,120
佢同事問咗你哋整理一下你嘅你嗰個睇法，阿張超雄議員。

482
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:35,410
好好啊！多謝主席。嗯，就住法援會唔會被濫用咧？即係。

483
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:43,160
尤其是喺一啲誒司法複核嘅案件啦，咁司法複核往往個對象當然都係政府啦。

484
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:48,580
整體司法覆核案最終係勝訴嘅，即係啊市民贏政府輸嗰個數字係幾多？係。

485
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:59,260
噉我所理解咧，其實司法覆核咧，大部分嘅個案都係輸嘅。咁但係頭先法務處處長就話，其實你哋嗰個援助嘅司法覆核案咧，有七成係成功嘅，贏嘅。

486
01:31:49,520 --> 01:32:08,360
嗰年嘅申請喺嗰度批出嘅，嚇，所以呢個我諗即係唔會，即係希望大家唔好誤會咗呢一點嚇。噉啊，如果講嗰個啊百分比咧，即係話啊成功到呢個啊司法覆核嗰度嚟講咧，即係大約咧，如果噉樣睇咧，係差唔多啊。

487
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:27,480
噉你外聘嘅律師會唔會外聘嘅律師，同埋你會繼續跟呢啲嘅官司，both solicitors and counsels，即係嗰個誒字幕律師同埋大律師都可以諗下用誒公即係公共醫院嗰個制度啊，即係話咧係你唔好得一個choice，都唔係嗰個當事人可以去揀，但係喺呢個。

488
01:28:44,630 --> 01:29:04,640
會唔會都係唔好收嗰種海鮮價，即係一個合理嘅價錢。噉你睇下，公立醫院嗰啲其實醫生，如果佢一出去私人執業，佢根本收費貴好多啦。咁但係咧，我哋要畀翻合理嘅價錢。我認為呢個係一個大家雙方都係好嘅。而有需要嘅案件，無論私

489
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:24,650
法復合或者其他民事刑事，我認為有需要係要畀，因為其實我哋嘅態度都係話你冇cap嘅。不過你喺個過程去執行嘅時候，誒，其實法律界自己都有啲律師咧係好大嘅意見嘅。咁所以呢一個咧，我想突然間你哋回應一下，或者咧，我喺誒排第二輪，我畀其他。

490
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:19,550
咁呢個係即係足以證明你哋嗰個審批咧，我相信一定會考慮到嗰個本身嘅案情有冇佢嘅誒實質嘅內容啦。誒嗰個可靠性同埋嗰個贏面係點啦？咁呢個好明顯係即係做得唔錯，因為有七成嘅贏。

491
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:39,750
贏面嗰個歷史咧係相係相當好噉，同埋照我理解，亦都只係一小部分嘅司法複核案咧係獲得發緩，即係大概係會唔會應該係大概百分之六誒左右啊？咁同埋即係誒，可唔可以畀翻個數字我哋誒知道整？

492
01:30:49,490 --> 01:31:09,500
啊，處長啊，多謝主席啊，多謝張議員問題啊。頭先我啊有提過啦，即係我哋喺啱啱過咗呢個二零一六年咧，我哋計過嗰個即係個成功率係百分之七十度嘅。咁呢個我哋係計我哋所有即係批出發換完結咗呢一年嘅案件。

493
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:29,510
嗰個收入覆核噉樣係係即係成功嘅。咁跟住咧，另外就啊啊，如果講話啊申請嗱，第一我想提講翻咧嗰個表咧，即係啊啊，我哋嗰個表嗰度有提到話啊喺呢個喺第十一段啦。噉我哋話喺二零一六年有四百三。

494
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:49,520
十七個申請，噉就二十七宗個法律援助書。嗱，有一點我哋要要明白咧，就係話呢個唔係一定係correspond to呢個四百三十七嘅，因為呢個係嗰個申請喺嗰一年嘅申請，嗰廿七宗咧就係嗰嗰嗰一年批出嘅，咁所以有可能係有一啲咧係喺之前。

495
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:33,050
大概六個percent度咯，嗰個成功率即係攞到呢個大概六點二個percent。係，咁即係其實我哋係有做嗰個即係啊啊去審查。咁同埋咧，就算批出咧，我哋都會做監管嘅，即係我哋會睇嗰個案件個進度嘅。啊，好多時咧，我哋批唔批？

496
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:53,060
批出咧，我哋會攞咗個獨立嘅大律師意見，跟住咧，我哋就跟住嗰個意見咧，我哋做批出咗之後咧，我哋亦要繼續一路收集到啲資料啊、啲證據啊、啲。如果發覺咦唔足夠理據咧，噉我哋會中止個法律援助書嘅。咁所以去到嗰個案件最終去到尾嚟講咧，個成功率其實都係即係屬屬於係高嚇。

497
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:34,690
唔唔該，好。

498
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:06,420
即係啊，司法上務官嗰邊嚟講，都構成一個壓力嘅嚇。

499
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:38,880
好誒，跟住係阿郭佩凡議員。

500
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:41,900
啊，多謝啊，主席。噉就想請教下咧，就因為誒，其實。

501
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:33,200
間資源亦都有限，係真係會構成個影響。咁誒，即係我諗大家都會注意到呢樣嘢。

502
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:23,240
睇到見你嗰個成功率係咁高咧，即係可能你嗰個審批都係相對保守嘅。咁即係我覺得係誒。

503
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:35,620
誒，即係支持你哋嘅工作啦，係啦，即係亦都可以。如果向寬鬆嗰邊睇嘅話，即係反而係向嗰個方向多啲啦。好，跟住係周浩鼎議員。

504
01:32:53,140 --> 01:33:13,150
係，所以即係我覺得其實就冇證據顯示我哋嘅法援喺司法覆核嗰度咧係有即係被濫用嘅情況啦。誒，反而即係如果佔整個司法覆核案嘅百分之六左右咧，誒，其實可能有少少手緊啲噉，即係而且兼且。

505
01:33:42,180 --> 01:34:02,190
早一段時間咧，都有即係可能有啲個別人士啦，就即係因為好明顯係濫用發緩嗰個情況咧，個別嘅申請人咧咁都啊接受咗一啲嘅處分，即係可能一段時間咧，佢不能夠再申請發緩。噉我就主要咧係想喺度即係請教下，即係誒處方啦，誒。

506
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:22,200
其實對於啊呢一啲即係濫用法援嘅申請人咧，我我都想了解下喺你哋而家運作機制裏面，過去如果不如話有啲嘅申請人佢真係多次咁去申請，或者係即係幾乎可能係濫用嘅情況噉樣噉嘅運作嘅情況底下，對於你哋本身構成嗰個影。

507
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:42,210
影響會係點樣啊？包括即係可能，因為我嘅理解，人就係咁多啦。即係法援處嘅人手資源，亦都係咁多嘅。咁如果喺處理呢啲嘅濫用嘅情況裏面，會唔會話可能就誒花咗啲時間去處理呢一啲嘅濫用嘅情況，其實係影同時間影響到。

508
01:34:42,230 --> 01:35:02,240
啊！其他一啲即係有merit嘅申請者嘅嘅情況嘅咧，噉我都想了解下嗰個運作嘅情況嘅。唔該啊，啊，處長係，康處長係。誒誒，多謝主席，多謝周議員問題。噉就誒嗱，如果濫用嘅情形咧，就誒我哋通常。

509
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:22,560
出得嗰個regulation level order咧，我哋考慮好多即係因素嘅。咁其因為個濫用咧，有陣時可能係影響唔係話淨係申請法律援助好多次，或者同一個事件好多次，係會影響成個上訴個渠道個制度嘅。因為每一次我哋唔批咧法律援助咧，佢佢有個

510
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:42,570
權係可以上訴啦。咁呢個當然我哋尊尊敬即係尊重佢嗰個呢個權益。個法例嗰度係咁寫嘅。但當佢一上訴嗰陣時咧，我哋就要安排由高等法院嘅啊司法常務官去聽。咁變咗咧有陣時即係做呢一個過程咧，有另外一啲案件等候上。

511
01:35:42,570 --> 01:36:02,580
訴嗰啲咧就可能會延遲嚇，尤其是如果嗰個上訴係好頻密，即係不停喺好多好多單嘅案件嚟講，佢都係上訴嘅，咁好多時咧都係被駁回嘅，上訴係唔唔係成功嘅咧？咁其實嚟講咧，佢係構成一個即係我哋資源嗰邊，即係嗰方面有個壓力，同埋對。

512
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:41,540
跟住二零一四嗰個係百分之六十嘅。

513
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:36,840
誒，二零一五年嗰個數字咧，就係百分之五十二嘅。

514
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:23,750
畀咗一個數字，我哋咧就話一六年咧就百分之七十成功，可唔可以畀埋一五一四一三一二嘅數字我？

515
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:56,650
係多謝主席。噉我諗我哋都知道，即係法援對誒香港維持呢個法律公義咧，非常之重要。咁咧就誒，我亦都覺得咧，即係誒誒法援都幫咗好多人嘅。咁嗯誒，但係咧誒一路以嚟咧，都仍然都係有咁多市民咧，即係覺得嚇。

516
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:27,200
O.K.好，明白係我。我諗咧，就都即係，正如頭先阿處長所講啦。即係如果你話有個別嘅申請人佢係好刻意噉啊濫用呢一個制度咧，其實就對於其他嘅一啲誒申請者嘅案件，或者對整體嚟講咧，可能即係因為人，即係都係嗰句啦，人手時。

517
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:17,170
即係誒，發緩係有被濫用嘅咁噉。主要咧，我相信主席咧都係因為事實真係有一啲嘅個案就譬如你哋今次誒，即係作出一個誒懲罰嘅個案啊，有個複核王噉就即係一個人可以不斷噉樣去誒申請發緩啊，提出司法複核啦。噉係一啲嘅誒誒個。

518
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:37,180
個案咧係會畀整個社會咧有一個印象咧，就係誒有人濫用緊呢個誒法援。咁事實亦都真係有人去濫用呢個法援，或者濫用呢個司法司法法律嘅程序。咁正如頭先周浩鼎議員所講，亦都係真係構成誒一啲誒社會上面一啲嘅損害同埋損。

519
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:57,190
實噉，你睇翻今次嘅文件咧，主席我就會覺得誒誒，文件裏邊提出嘅好多嘅數字咧，我哋都係今日都係首次知道。誒好多時咧，市民提出我哋一啲嘅問題啊，點解噉樣？點解噉樣咧？其實我哋都無從去回應嘅。噉係咪代表誒整個制度咧，即係嗰個透明度唔夠？

520
01:37:57,190 --> 01:38:17,200
高咧，例如誒，你哋都有講到，就係喺誒文件裏邊提到，其實你哋係有理據啊，去去誒誒，即係從法律觀點去決定批定唔批嚇。咁但係咧，嗰個誒，譬如審批嗰個誒準則啊、誒透明度啊，點樣先批啊、誒拒絕嘅原因。

521
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:37,210
啊！誒批出嘅誒理據啊，等等咧，其實誒大眾市民好似無從得知啊。咁會唔會你哋可以考慮係可以誒，即係誒畀多啲資訊出嚟，公開透明度，即係透明度高啲，咁令到大眾市民都可以誒，即係對發緩嘅制度，即係。

522
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:57,220
進行一個公開嘅監察，咁第一誒可以令到個制度本身可以運得更加好咯。誒第二咧誒誒有濫用嘅咧，希望有一個阻嚇性啦，係咪誒？如果冇濫用嘅，即係咁正常嘅，噉我哋可以爭取更加多嘅資源去幫到更加多需要嘅人，否則咧如。

523
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:17,230
如果一路係畀有心人去，一方面有人我相信啦係濫用，我哋而家都已經有處懲處，當然就係有人濫用啦。咁另一方面咧，有好多人排緊隊，即係需要更加多嘅發換。咁中間咧就會變成即係一個誒無謂嘅爭拗啊！你哋會唔會考慮將個透明度提高咧？

524
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:37,550
主席，啊！多謝主席，多謝國院嘅問題。嗯，我我相信即係嗯，我哋係我哋其實現時都有啊落社區啦，有學校咧做啲講座推，即係介紹我哋法律援助服務嘅。不過我相信我哋可以即係噉，再可以做多做多一啲去，即係推廣等。

525
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:57,560
即係明白嗰個成個個制，我我頭先所講嘅咧，我想即係再重新多一次咧。誒，唔係宣傳推廣教育咩叫法援，或者你哋工作係點，而係將你哋誒一啲嘅理據誒，無論每一個個案嘅審批或者拒絕申請嘅理據咧，係可以公開透明啲，可以畀大眾係查。

526
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,140
嗯。

527
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,620
唔該，主席。好，處長。

528
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:09,720
廣泛，我想特別指出咧，就係。

529
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,390
誒多謝誒，多謝主席，多謝啊。

530
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:45,780
誒，跟住係謝偉俊議聯主席。首先，申告咧，我所經營嘅律師行咧，有接辦法律援助住個案嘅。

531
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:13,480
同阿Sir所講嘅前者有啲唔同嘅，前者真係有受屈者、有受冤者嘅，後者咧只係佢係覺得自己喺係幫廣大市民出把聲噉樣。咁呢種個案，你哋有冇分類去處理咧？第一個問題。

532
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:40,540
但係另一種咧，亦都市或者坊間市民或者係輿誒輿論比較關注嘅，就係有啲可能其實唔係啲太太大嘅咩切身利益，但係有啲人咧就係好得閒嘅，即係佢哋有。

533
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:38,490
數字噉樣擺出嚟咧，唔係噉樣去畀一個表我哋。主席，我好錯。我要畀下一位，唔係，我我我仲，你主席可以舉手第二第二個。主席，我畀一分鐘你。就所以咧，即係根據今日所有呢啲數字咧，我覺得我哋得出嘅結論咧，就話發還係完全冇被濫用嘅咧，係唔合理嘅。

534
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:26,470
如果話針對個別申請發還者、接受發還者，佢哋牽涉到自身嘅一啲嘅同政府部門嘅瓜葛，或者係啲決定係覺得受屈嘅，或者覺得係行政上有錯誤嘅，佢哋提出呢種司法復核嘅案件其中一種。

535
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:17,570
查詢得到啊，即係網上面可以揾得到呢啲資訊嘅，咁變咗咧，我哋可以監察到。而家我哋係無從監察，唔知邊啲係即係係誒有理，邊啲係冇理誒？即係誒，所以咧噉樣唔係一個好合誒，即係好理想嘅方法誒。所以希望誒聽到啦。咁另外，我想問一問咧，頭先你就突然間。

536
01:40:42,020 --> 01:41:02,030
O.K.個成功嗰個主席啊，呢啲數字咧，其實係咪可以即係譬如過往十年嘅成功率啊等等，係咪可以畀啲詳細嘅數字？我哋書面補充啊，唔該。好啊，誒誒，書面補充啦，同埋頭先我都有指出啦。你哋就咁講一個邊一個律師做咗三個case嗰啲咧，唔可以做到我哋嘅ref。

537
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:22,040
過唔到關嘅，你一定要畀具體。究竟佢做三個個案係賺咗幾多錢？係佔總數究竟係幾多？你就咁畀三個個案畀我哋噉樣，係冇辦法做到一個誒合理嘅評估㗎。你明唔明啊？如果佢三個大案都係嗰個律師樓，噉我哋唔知啊。即係你呢啲。

538
01:41:47,460 --> 01:42:07,470
我諗啲數字咧，我其中一個可能隱藏咗嘅誒情況咧，就我想探討下嘅就係，因為而家講緊基本上啲數字咧，即係分咗兩大類，一咧就係就司法復核案件嚟講啊，就有講一啲係所謂顯反嘅個案咧，同埋啲其他嘅個案。但喺其他嘅裏邊咧，其實係好廣。

539
01:42:40,820 --> 01:43:00,830
本住係冇乜本本錢喺手，即係要負責嘅。佢又特別關，當然係佢係熱誠嘅，對社會全部關注嘅。但係問題就係佢太關注，關注咧佢經常咧就係誒以好低嘅成本咧，就利用公堂咧去挑戰政府呢一樣嘢或者嗰條法例嘅某一樣嘢。咁呢一種咧喺個性質上咧、本質上咧。

540
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:33,780
即係如果有嘅話咧，我想更加清楚數字係點，因為呢個係關鍵嘅。就喺攬容冇容冇攬容方面咧，係一個關鍵嘅因素嚟。第二咧，我都留意到最近有啲批評或關於即係啊，當局咧啊法律援助署咧，佢哋係用一個所謂誒集不條條例去拒絕一啲申請人，甚至係將佢哋所謂叫做擺落去黑名單。

541
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:53,790
三年呢一樣嘢咧，噉我想理解下，其實過往你哋法援處有幾多個呢啲個案係真係擺落去黑名單，而係嗰個平均嘅長短度係幾多嘅咧？係咪一次過用三年呢個係一個比較誒，或者係過分，或者係比較誒盡嘅一個最高嘅限額嚟嘅？咁呢個想數字上，如果而家提交唔到，希望遲啲可以提供到。

542
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:20,910
阿謝賢嘅問題噉就啊，頭先講答回答第一個問題先啦。啊，我哋法律援助個準則去決定批定唔批法律援助咧，我哋冇將佢特別話分開，即係頭先啊謝賢你講嗰個問題啦。噉我最緊要睇有冇理據嘅。咁喺睇佢有冇理據嚟提出。

543
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:40,920
呢個訴訟咧，我哋其實有一點喺司法複核咧，我哋會考慮埋佢有冇個我哋叫做locus嘅。如果佢冇locus，係呢個司法複核咧，我哋係唔會批發還畀佢嘅嚇。咁呢個係。但係呢個locus我明白啊，大家可能都都知道啦嚇。但係啲locus細嘅，對唔住，打斷咗你啊，因為我想聚焦啲問問嚇。即係如果空氣污染對於佢。

544
01:44:40,920 --> 01:45:00,930
佢嚟講，佢話佢自己有啲少病哮喘嘅，噉佢話佢個居住咧就有污染，或者佢哋環評唔合標準嘅。其實係係咪相對容易去搞掂啲local咧？以你嘅經驗，定還是係以往係咪喺呢方面咧？我想係咪應該可以再睇睇個關鍵位守得緊比較緊少少咧？係阿康處長。係啊，不過好多時嚟。

545
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,580
長短。

546
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:01,820
出生就三年㗎啦，係唔該。

547
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:58,820
啊！嗰啲啊，限期全部都係三年嘅。

548
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:07,520
啊！我排第二輪嚇，噉啊何君堯議員，仲有邊個第二輪嘅？

549
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:26,070
畀咗個外聘嘅大律師，你都要做咗判斷嘅。第二咧就係我頭先講另外一類啦，就係律師。

550
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:28,890
咁變咗，如果佢根本係啊，可能唔構成足夠嘅嘅理據去攞到lift，噉我哋係唔會批法律援援助畀佢嘅。

551
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:38,990
係呢啲就係印象啫，我哋都話，因為冇數字啊。係啊，你咪外外邊大律師，邊一個人批，一個唔批，大家都用誒basic咯，大家可能都係啲中產嘅背景。

552
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:52,300
我哋就喺二零一六年咧，Regulation Eleven嘅命令出咗咧，就係一共係二十八個嘅；喺二零一五年係二十五個嘅；喺二零一四年咧係四十三個。

553
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:40,820
係係數字方面咧，或者啲數消息都有嘅，一冇嘅請會有提供啊。啊，我都啊，我都有嗰個數字喺度嘅。咁過去啊，我講緊過去嗰三年啦。

554
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:20,940
嚟講咧，係超複雜嘅案件嚟嘅。我哋係會第一，我哋睇翻有冇過去有冇judgement已經係判咗啦。如果未有嗰個判決咧，好多時我哋係攞個獨立嘅大律師嘅意見嘅。咁個獨立大律師，我哋亦嘅要要求佢考慮埋所有呢啲factor係咪充足，佢能夠攞到leave嘅個factor係係咪攞到leave咯？

555
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:28,090
嚇咁咧就誒，我哋誒郭佩凡議員最多三分鐘啦嚇。我哋跟進啦。第一咧就係我想跟進翻嘅呢個係制度嘅問題。啊，阿署長多次提你批唔批嘅時候咧，都會係問外聘嘅大律師，所以可唔可以畀翻啲數字咧？過往你係去。

556
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:48,100
究竟有嗰啲案件批唔批嘅時候，問咗幾多嘅大律師係係外聘嘅嚇？佢哋係咪誒來自唔同嘅律師樓，或者係同一位一樣啦？你嘅喺呢度咧就畀翻個個數字畀我哋，係咪一個誒比較公平嘅分配，甚至？

557
01:46:48,100 --> 01:47:08,110
咧就係你哋譬如同時去揾誒獨立嘅大律師嘅意見嘅時候，係咪都已經本身應該有個choice係會輪住嘅咧？噉樣唔係講問嚟問去，逢係J.R.就問嗰個誒嗰個外聘嘅大律師，因為話佢係expert噉樣嚇。因為咧啲律師就係講你來來去畀嗰個人做其他。

558
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:28,120
他人咪一路冇機會去做咁咧。我頭先提出嘅制度，我希望你哋諗嘅係公平嘅。誒，包括咧，其實當事人佢認為有case，咁唔止係locus啦，仲要係meritorious case先至可以有有leave啦。而家係嘛？呢啲大家其實都係知嘅。咁變咗，其實你唔需要集中可能。

559
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:59,350
噉你就已經有人又不服你哋㗎啦，一定係噉，所以我要翻曬呢啲數字。第二咧就係誒，我希望第日獨立大律師，我都係一個建議嚟嘅，就係你唔會係由你哋一個人主觀，就係話我負責呢個case，我就揾揾佢㗎啦。咁事實就自己一定會有熟嘅，咁咧你就係一定要。

560
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:19,360
輪嘅嚇，輪到邊個case可能跟住原來打到好大嘅，但係就唔係可能就唔係輪到你熟嗰個咁咧。呢啲你哋呢啲噉嘅意見咧，唔使揾到天價嘅律師，或者一定係最experience都識都識畀意見嘅。大家應該係你哋我嚟參考，因為你哋裏邊都有律師㗎，你唔可以話就咁掟咗出去，咁個責任就。

561
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:27,850
同埋大狀。

562
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,350
郭佩凡議員，我哋其實做咗咁好嘅嘢。

563
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,480
案件嗱，以如果一萬宗嚟講，有一百宗批出。

564
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:55,330
啊！就唔好畀人緾話我哋發緩咧，就係唔負責任。

565
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:34,720
嗰個你哋諗咧，就係話大家都係冇唔可以有一個肯定性咧，就係嗰個人雖然可能熟。

566
01:49:52,100 --> 01:50:00,870
二千零宗係criminal啊，即係佔嘅數字咧係成萬接近九千至一萬宗係legal A批出嘅案件。

567
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:23,800
咧噉，我哋係要知嘅嚇，定係你都有個fair fair distribution。好咁咧，跟住咧就係啊何君瑤議員。

568
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:34,170
多謝主席。其實咧，就我我自己覺得咧，就嗰個誒使喺嗰個司，即係judicial review咧。

569
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:46,120
佢佢嗰個council收誒或者律師樓收幾多錢嘅？因為一個平均J.R嘅數都成三廿零三廿萬至四廿萬不等。如果你畀成廿幾單佢嘅時候，真係好。

570
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:51,570
誒B.R.嘅案件裏邊咧，佔我哋嘅開支五個percent係好可觀，好可觀。誒實際上，誒香港政府喺呢一方面嚟講，完全冇論息。個數字來自翻喺你政府文件裏邊，一年裏邊我哋批七千幾單師傅嘅。

571
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:55,010
嚇噉，但係咧，佢未必可以揀A律師。原來排唔係排到佢啦，係排到B律師，佢都冇得揀嘅嚇。噉樣咧就係一個公平性，仲防止咗濫用。同時咧，我係要求嘅呢個喺資源上咧係接誒嗰個啊法律援助嘅個案係唔應該畀到海鮮價噉。

572
01:48:55,010 --> 01:49:15,020
噉樣嘅，咁所以咧，我唔我真係唔知嘅。你講嗰三個case係乜嘢？有司有啲律師一個case一年已經一路打打落去都係已經係好天文數字嘅。所以咧，呢啲咧你哋要畀具體嘅數字，同埋咧要話埋你嗰個誒獨立大律師，如果喺公法嗰度即係public law嘅，係咪成日都係問嗰幾個咧？

573
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:21,220
就以呢高A嚟講，剛才啊，注張票引引新正話睇嗰個表裏邊啊，一四一五一六一誒一三誒一二一三一誒一四一五一六咁嗰啲咧。當然嗰個數字唔係直接係可以顯示顯示出嗰個使幾多錢，但係可以有跡可尋。嗰度都批出成成幾十張，接近一百張嘅J R。

574
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:45,770
高啦，因為每年嚟講平均嘅數字係百四至到誒百二至到百五度一個percent嘅佔有嘅case load，但係我哋可以畀五個percent嘅嘅嘅錢出去資助佢打官司咧。呢一個係相當可觀咁解。噉我所嘅回應咧就誒誒誒。

575
01:50:55,610 --> 01:51:15,620
反而咧，而家我哋睇到嘅數字咧，一個percent嘅case，所以佔咗我哋五個percent嘅誒每年嘅開支咧，呢個數唔少嘅。我覺得係個比例嚟講，我哋有偏袒過分偏袒咗誒誒誒呢一個judicial review。咁所以咧，講翻而家我哋嘅B B即係誒。

576
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:35,630
An extra B同埋嗰個B表嗰度咧，會唔會即係唔好淨係睇話個case allocation話要畀誒三十幾宗或者二十幾宗咁咁嗰個係好好唔道性，即係主席就提出嚟有陣時你淨係睇個case嘅number咧個數量咧，未必充分反映出即係。

577
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,420
個總數之外。

578
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:51,360
好嚇，答咗個辯憲議員嘅問題先，加翻幾秒鐘畀佢嚇，計時嘅。

579
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:25,670
呢個制度令到呢啲問題即係誒唔出現，都係減少市民對法援嗰個質疑咧。

580
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:57,940
誒多謝阿郭議員嘅問題。誒，我哋其實咧喺～

581
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:25,330
特別嘅利益嘅瓜分啊，又好或者乜嘢。另外調翻轉咧，當一個接法律援助。

582
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:57,880
側埋一邊，嗱我哋要愛一個叫做fair distribution allocation，咁所以會唔會有個有個噉嘅制度咧？除咗睇按宗數。

583
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:19,710
站喺你哋嘅部門裏邊都可以監察住，喂，米住先使，即係已經畀五單JL。你嘅時候條數已經差唔多出超超標啦。嗱，呢一個咧，我希望即係你哋去諗諗。誒，我嘅初步嘅睇法咧就誒發換係好慷慨，一個percent case low畀五個percent嘅分定。

584
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:39,720
第二咧，唔好淨係用case number嚟去定定咗係嗰個公平嘅嗰個分配咁解啫。我畀你嘅意見啊，多謝。好，跟住係啊，郭佩凡議員嚇，噉我哋劃線啦嚇。好啊，多謝主席。咁咧就誒，我哋今次呢份文件其實就係想消除公眾嘅疑慮啦，即係解決咗呢個誒發回。

585
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:59,730
究竟有冇被濫用呢個問題？咁正如我頭先所講啦，即係誒又唔可以話冇被濫用噉。不過咧，可能被濫用咧個宗數唔係咁多，冇我哋大眾市民想象咁多。但係可能一單咧對社會嗰個衝擊咧就非常之大啦。咁咧就但係咧誒呢份文件咧，似乎未解決到咧有市民咧就誒。

586
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:19,740
誒擔心思傷受受嘅問題，例如真係有一啲嘅律師專係去鼓勵啊一啲誒市民嚇去去申請發還，跟住再提名佢哋成為呢個代表律師呢個問題誒，真急即係即係攞到生意啦。正如頭先啊啊林美芬主席所講，你哋有冇即係諗住改變？

587
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:46,280
係處長同埋啊，秘書長。嗯。啊，主席，噉我我希望有機會都答翻頭先所有嗰啲問題啦。佢話啊，第第一個。我個時間，主席，如果答翻頭先所有嘅問題，咁咪咪用翻我啲雞腳。你答咗佢呢個問題先。我答咗你呢個問題。我最後有總結時間畀大家嘅，大家參與呢一。

588
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:18,230
兩年前，我哋已經開始已經加入咗我哋一個叫做decoration嘅system嘅。我哋嗰度咧係要求嗰個啊申請人，如果係要選擇自己嘅律師咧，佢係要申報佢同嗰個律師，即係個申請人要申報同嗰個律師或者佢嗰啲employee係冇任何嘅，即係啊。

589
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:45,620
cases嘅律師喺個assignment嗰度咧，我哋已經擺咗個condition落去咧，佢係唔可以話有一個喺利益嗰方面有個衝突，同埋係佢要acknowledge一樣嘢咧。如果係有一個噉嘅利益嘅衝突，或者要佢叫佢得話，我嚟申請嚟嚟誒申請發還，跟住你揾翻我哋啦。如果係為咗，

590
01:54:45,620 --> 01:55:05,630
佢自己嘅利益咧，佢係唔可以接呢一個case嘅。咁呢個係我哋擺咗落去個declaration嘅system。呢個我哋係直情喺我哋嗰個assignment letter裡面嘅。誒，主席，我係我介佢反映嘗試一下咧，即係問多啲關於你而家頭先所講嗰兩個。一個咧你就話咧，你一定講明咧，佢哋係唔會瓜分。我而家冇講瓜分喎，個律師去揾一

591
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:25,640
個啊啊啊揾一個誒誒市民，跟住咧就誒鼓勵佢去誒，即係申請法院提出訴訟。誒，佢冇話要同個市民去瓜分喎，佢想賺佢自己嘅錢。個市民根本都啊，畀你慫恿一下，佢咪去咯。咁根本唔存在瓜分嘅問題。如果你用呢一個你用呢一個嚟去界定嘅話咧，咁可能亦都解。

592
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:45,650
解決唔到嘅問題。第二咧，關於利益衝突，利益衝突，你有冇一個準則㗎？即係有冇一個明文嘅指引，何為利益衝突咧？即係誒，主席唔好意思，我我講多兩句啦。舉舉例啦，即係希望政黨同同事唔好咁敏感。我唔係指定某一個政黨。如果某一個誒政黨嘅誒議員係係一路咧，就係針對緊某一個。

593
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,300
好，仲有冇其他？

594
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:45,540
yes, I want to support what Doctor, what Mr. Kong is doing.

595
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:39,770
嚇，咁咧就啊啊，Mr. Perry。

596
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:57,720
要給法律援助一個無限預算。

597
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:04,400
And that has always been the case since legal aid was started in the late 1960s.

598
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:12,370
可以講畀我聽，主張。嗯，多謝主席，多謝國聯嘅問題。我諗有一點係好重要咧，就係其實。

599
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:52,790
The first point is that the government gave an undertaking. I think in two thousand and one.

600
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:40,560
所以我需要一啲證據嚟舉報，我先至可以做到做到個查。係啊，個利益衝突本身有冇一個標準嘅咧？

601
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:32,970
度去改變，即係大家認為而家可能存在嘅嘅問題嘅，好唔好啊？你繼續嚇，我可以補啊，後補啲資料畀你啊，主席嚇，係。

602
01:55:45,650 --> 01:56:05,660
政府嘅政策或者某一個嘅撥款噉，跟住哦喺誒立法會度誒通過咗，跟住佢鼓勵一個誒，即係佢佢哋政黨嘅律師鼓勵一啲市民去J.R.政府去打呢個官司，拖延呢個呢個誒，即係誒誒項目嘅誒工程嘅進度咁咁噉樣為之有冇利益衝突啊？你可唔可以？

603
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:32,660
我哋部門咧係有一個可以舉報嘅機制嘅。我我好難憑空即係啊，話呢個係咪一個利益衝突？我我我需要嘅咧就係有人可以提供資料畀我哋，話有人係做緊呢一樣嘢係濫用，噉我可以去進行一個調查。如果調查成功嚟講，我哋會可以進進行一個紀律嘅處。

604
01:56:42,690 --> 01:57:02,700
啊，因為我哋喺法援我哋睇嘅咧，就係嗰個申請人，我有一樣嘢好重要咧，就法律援助條例，佢最最最重要係維護個申請人嗰個利益。主席啊，我想提出嘅咧就係利益衝突咧，未必淨係金錢有關先為之利益衝突嘅，如果政治上面有利益咧，都可能係構成利益衝突。咁希望咧，法援處。

605
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:22,710
詳細考慮好，因為我哋時間所限，咁咧我就畀署長三分鐘，畀Mr. Perry都係三分鐘。最後你哋誒誒簡潔噉樣總結啦嚇，好冇啊？係署長先啊。首先我想答翻頭先你問嗰個問題啦，就關於嗰個啊，我哋攞獨立大律師意見嗰個。

606
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:42,950
噉我有個數字喺度嘅喺過去二零一六年咧，我哋一共咧係攞咗一百零三宗呢個啊獨立嘅大律師見嘅，裡面牽涉嘅大律師咧係有六十三位嘅，所以其實嚟講係分得好混嘅，即係唔係話我唔係就係要二零一六啦。你畀個special啊，二零一五年咧就九十九宗咧，我哋有五十個大律師。

607
01:57:42,950 --> 01:58:02,960
知嘅，二零一四年咧，我哋九十中有四十五個大律師嘅，所以平均嚟講，如果你將佢計average係大每一個大律師係接大兩單到。嗱，處長啊，你又係跳翻嗰個毛病咧，我係唔收貨嘅，就係你淨係同我講數字。我頭先同你講係area public law係咪又係嗰幾個誒誒civil law係嗰，即係你實質你。

608
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:22,970
你噉你噉樣擺畀我話誒個個總共幾多個嗰個其實係唔可以有參考價值。噉你翻去細緻啲，你畀個資料畀我好冇啊？即係呢個area，你係咪又係揾嚟揾去嗰幾耐嗰個又揾嗰類？即係我哋先至真係可以睇到係咪一個fair distribution啫。我覺得咧一定要同一個制。

609
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,400
and I would urge them.

610
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,400
And that has consumed a lot of time and expense.

611
02:00:28,610 --> 02:00:33,000
not to do that because in it's a confidential system.

612
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:10,520
application was granted and quite, and why it was refused.

613
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:28,230
those that want to sort of pick open the file to

614
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:27,270
The applications of dealing with illegal immigrants.

615
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:56,440
to see that it's a very fair system and that there is not nitpicking just over a few cases.

616
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:49,520
And I think one has to ask the chairman and the legislative council to strike a balance for everybody's interests.

617
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:21,720
There's an upsurge in these JR cases because the director of immigration was not processing.

618
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:13,990
secondly, I think that Mr Ho probably Miss Junius Ho probably missed the point that.

619
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:42,100
and the appeals are confidential too, so that people's private affairs are not the subject of public scrutiny.

620
02:00:57,950 --> 02:01:06,800
I think the the other thing which Mr. Kong ought to be congratulated for is the high success rate in these judicial review cases.

621
01:59:56,190 --> 02:00:05,670
and I think it would be quite wrong for the legal aid department to be forced to give information to the public about why a particular

622
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:20,390
因為有個人 aspect of each case， and I think the great advantage of our current legal aid system is it's run confidentially.

623
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:43,280
And of course, just after the handover, there were also a large number of cases involving people's right of abode and right to come to Hong Kong and their children.

624
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:55,890
所以這是用Madam Chair's words，一個季節性，approach。這就是什麼發生。所以， at the moment，那些案件正在進行。

625
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:02,800
要 have。

626
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:26,870
一個不公道、高成本。

627
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:24,460
但那係事實，那那些個案 lives， 你唔可以單單拎出司法覆核係。

628
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:15,950
and it's they may cost more to run, as compared with a divorce or a simple contract claim or a running down action.

629
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:53,150
And if we want proper people to have be properly represented, and have their rights tested properly under the one country two systems.

630
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:41,460
From other cases, specialist officers deal with these cases. They're not going to be moved across to personal injuries or contract claims. Sorry, so it's. I just want to complete my sentence. It's you can't just switch resources from

631
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:26,720
for you just speaking your mind in this chamber, so these rights are very very important at this point in time, and I do commend Mr. Kwong for spending time and effort on them, and it isn't a detraction.

632
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:43,450
bit of litigation, because that those are of necessity what the costs are involved. If you look at the submissions in these cases, they don't take just days to do. They take weeks to do, and the papers are just the submissions themselves are inches thick.

633
02:01:53,430 --> 02:02:11,150
This is most important because I, you know, if you're in the Legislative Council, I'm just in Legislative Council saying something and speaking your mind. You don't want your mum or dad arrested somewhere else in another place.

634
02:02:41,740 --> 02:03:01,750
One type of officer handling one type of claim to another, and I think it's fallacious to do that. Thank you. Yeah, I think thank you for your opinion and attendance of this meeting. But I have to let Mr. Pere also know, Legislative Council, when we handle public fund, we have

635
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:23,610
We have to require public scrutiny, and legal aid has occupied a lot of public resources. This is our role. This judicial committee is not only looking at the interests of the legal profession, but also public interests. So, to deal with confidentiality.

636
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:43,620
You can always put the name off. Okay, we do not need to give us the names and the particular case. But I think Miss Fox's request is to get the reasons, the grounds why why they approve the funding. I have no objection at all, even to expand.

637
02:03:43,620 --> 02:04:03,630
the funding of legal aid. That's why from the very beginning we said we do not need to have any cap. But the distribution of cases, not only for judicial review, I think some of them are very interested in judicial review, but some other cases we are interested in, like civil cases, and we said that also disputes for

638
02:04:03,630 --> 02:04:23,640
個individual and IO etc. So we are we have to review the legal aid system not only from a very narrow perspective, but we we do need to have public scrutiny. So legislative council is to supervise how the public money is.

639
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:43,650
spent， so we are actually we we would like to get how you actually allocate those fundings. I think those questions within this committee we have to discuss and you have to follow. Okay. But in terms of whether the cases should be kept confidential

640
02:04:43,650 --> 02:05:03,660
confidential, they can be kept confidential all the time. Okay, but not like this. Give us just how many cases. Okay, we need to know how many percentage of the resources have you spent on one case, and whether they concentrate on some particular law firms.

641
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:59,380
嘅涵蓋範圍擴大到包括被香港執法機關扣留嘅人士咧，展開研究。

642
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:54,910
咁跟住我哋就係誒要邀請咧，就係民政事務局。

643
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:47,330
住發言嗰個見有咩意見咧？我哋好樂意咧喺我哋內部審議入邊咧去加以考慮嘅。唔該，主席。

644
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:29,970
In this regard, you can submit your additional information to our panel later in writing. Okay.

645
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:21,190
咧，亦都係唔可行嘅。因此咧，法援局認為咧，以行政計劃嘅形式為被扣留人士提供法律意見咧，係更為合適。

646
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:20,330
係啊，民政事務局為法律援助服務局就被扣留在警署人士提供法律諮詢服務嘅建議。

647
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:32,270
噉我哋而家咧，亦都係先請副秘書長李伯全先生介紹文件，亦都請大律師公會嘅代表誒，Mister Graham Harris發言嘅。

648
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:09,260
就係有關向被扣留在警處嘅人士提供法律意見嘅服務，係C B括弧四一三八六足十六-hyphen十七括弧零五。

649
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:47,490
援助嘅範圍問題咧，我都想，如果你唔介意，我好快好簡短咧，係做一個好簡單。真係唔可以，對唔住，因為頭先應該要講，而家我哋再講下一步，好唔好啊？你可以十秒，因為法誒法律援助嘅範圍，我哋會繼續再討論，好唔好啊？

650
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:52,100
警署試行，維期咧係唔多過兩年。法援局亦都建議咧喺試行一年同埋兩年之後咧，分別進行中期同埋全面嘅檢討。法援局建議推行嘅試驗計劃咧，佢主要嘅特點咧就羅列咗喺文件嘅第五段。

651
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:15,720
喺研究進行期間咧，法援局咧曾經同相關嘅持份者都會面，包括咗兩個法律專業團體啦、法援處啦、當事律師服務啦，同埋多間咧執法機構。法援局咧亦都有就其他司法管轄區所提供嘅法律支援咧進行比較研究。

652
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:23,670
或some particular individuals, and that actually that is also a lot of letters sent to us. They would like us to discuss from different solicitors and councils also. So thank you very much. But I think we are requesting for more information. I can't allow any discussion in.

653
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:54,030
唔該，主席。誒呢份文件咧，其實向委員咧就介紹咧法律援助局服務局咧，就係為被扣留在警署人士提供法律方面嘅援助嘅研究結果同埋建議。法援局嘅建議咧就喺文件嘅附件。誒，少少背景，零九年十一月嘅時候咧，法援局就應否將法律支援？

654
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:37,000
經過審慎考慮相關議題之後咧，法援局係建議設立一個由政府資助嘅計劃，向被扣留人士咧提供法律意見。有關嘅服務咧，應該係以試驗形式去推行，亦都應該分階段去落實，同埋不時要作出檢討。法援局咧認為試驗計劃咧係可以先喺四間具代表性嘅。

655
02:07:52,750 --> 02:08:12,760
法援局咧都曾經考慮咧能否咧將建議計劃納入咧法援處管理嘅法援計劃，不過咧向被扣留人士提供法律意見咧並唔屬於現行法援服務嘅涵蓋範圍，係同埋咧喺需要提供即時緊急法律支援嘅情況之下咧，按法援條例規定進行經濟審查。

656
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:41,490
法援局建議設立呢一個由政府資助向被扣留人士提供法律意見計劃咧，其實係會對財政同運作方面咧造成重大影響嘅，所以政府咧仲係需要進行一個咧詳細嘅內部商議。待商議之後咧，我哋會再次向事務委員會作出報告。不過今日咧，啊，各委員咧，如果就住

657
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:43,240
Okay，thank you，Mr Harris。

658
02:08:56,890 --> 02:09:01,150
Madam Chairman, we warmly welcome this pilot scheme.

659
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:48,430
啊！而家咧就係去到委員發問，第一位係周浩鼎議員。

660
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:55,610
好，噉我而家咧就請大律師公會嘅代表，阿Mr. Graham Harris，please。

661
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:21,170
他 might need advice on whether or not he should exercise his right to silence, whether he should cooperate, whether he should provide information.

662
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:12,140
The time between an initial arrest and a charge, or a release on bail, can be a very important time for a person who is a suspect.

663
02:09:21,450 --> 02:09:39,060
And for him to be able to do that with the benefit and advantage of proper legal advice has to be a good thing and in the public interest. We don't really have any other comments to make. We welcome the programme and we look forward to seeing it implemented.

664
02:09:49,460 --> 02:10:09,470
啊！多謝啊，主席。咁當然啦，即係對於啊被扣留嘅人士，佢哋要得到啊法律嘅諮詢或者法律嘅意見去保護佢哋有嗰個保障咧。我哋誒往往一定係認同嘅啊。呢個亦都係我哋制度裏面，我哋作為一個法律界嘅人士咧，大家都係一定維護呢個。

665
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:29,480
制度咁誒，然而咧，我就有少少問題想請教一下咧，就係關於今次呢一個嘅試行推行嘅計劃咧。誒嗱，第一咧就誒有啲嘅問題咧，佢未可能仲未解決到，都想問清楚嘅。誒係唔係即係代表以後嘅警署，即係雖然。

666
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:49,490
而家話揀四間嚟試行啦，噉係咪將來所有嘅警署都要配備到呢一個嘅服務？咁而可能會唔會係代表住我哋可能好多律師嘅行家都要安排，即係所謂二十四小時都係可以提供到呢方面嘅服務咧？咁或者等陣可能即係各方嘅朋友可以。

667
02:10:49,490 --> 02:11:09,500
話話畀我哋聽。咁另外咧就誒，亦都對於嗰個誒提供嘅法律意見咧，因為文件裡面就誒冇寫得好詳細啦。咁當然，如果你話純粹係問下，即係可能保持周密嗰個權利啊，咁呢個就比較簡單啦。咁但係如果你話再牽涉到進一步，即係

668
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:29,510
即係可能係關於可能喺佢嘅過程中間係咪都仲有牽涉埋陪同埋？即係可能係落口供嗰個情況咧。嗱，如果牽涉到呢樣嘢咧，噉我根據文件裡面講就話誒，被拘留人士提供嘅服務又唔應該超逾一個鐘頭。咁但係其實我哋。

669
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:49,520
如果往往平時即係有做開嘅經驗，就知道啦。即係如果陪個客去落口供噉，其實玩下手啊，點會一個鐘咁少啊？即係好老實講，好簡單嘅，可能都用上兩三個小時，亦唔出奇嘅嚇。咁誒誒，而且亦都牽涉到另一個情況啦。如果親身到達嘅時候咧。

670
02:11:49,520 --> 02:12:09,530
誒又可能牽涉到即係可能係唔知道喺邊個location啦嚇，即係呢呢個又係另一個問題。咁誒，關於咧嗰個誒，即係誒電話嘅諮詢嗰方面咧，我都想話請教一下。噉係咪即係如果按照而家局方嗰個文件上面講嘅安排咧，就係要？

671
02:12:09,530 --> 02:12:29,540
誒設立一個電話中心，咁咧就誒又係咪好似我頭先剛才咁問嗰個問題啦？呢個電話中心係咪二十四小時都要安排到，即係我哋律師嘅行家去當值去處理呢一啲嘅誒諮詢嘅服務咧？噉，噉我都想了解下呢方面嗰個嘅誒安排係咪就係咁？

672
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:49,550
咁都想聽聽局方嗰個誒回覆先嘅，唔該。好係，唔該，秘書長，多謝誒主席，誒多謝周議員嘅問題。誒，正如我剛才喺介紹嘅時候講咧，呢個建議係法援局嘅建議，噉佢哋建議咧係我哋做一個試驗計劃，誒揀四間具代表性嘅警處咧，去試行呢一個誒。

673
02:16:19,930 --> 02:16:20,610
誒。

674
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:07,620
係楊嶽橋議員。

675
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:47,050
誒，我就想了解一下，如果？

676
02:15:47,330 --> 02:15:56,760
因為往往咧好多嘅刑事案件初期咧，其實你係未必咁快知道相關嘅被拘捕人士咧是否會獲釋嘅。

677
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:07,930
好多時候係會完成曬成個嘅程序，先知道佢會唔會獲保釋。除非局方認為，誒或者即係法援局認為係。

678
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:19,650
如果遇到呢啲個案，而家就係一入到去，我一拘捕一個人士啦，我就即刻話畀佢聽，佢有或者冇保釋。咁但係往往咧，我哋嘅經驗咧，主席就係。

679
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:43,430
肯定主席，噉我亦都覺得可能呢個係需要進一步嘅討論，係比較健康嘅。其次咧，就係第五D段咧提及有關服務應指擴展至被警方拒絕保釋嘅人，或者冇能力繳付保釋金嘅被扣留人士。

680
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:45,230
咧做一個全面檢討嚇，咁所以喺我哋同相關嘅政策局同埋相關嘅部門喺去研究嗰個誒計劃嘅細節嘅時候咧，去內部審議嘅時候咧，頭先提過，周怡提過嘅一啲嘅意見咧，我哋一定會加以考慮。

681
02:12:49,550 --> 02:13:09,560
啊！提供呢一個法律免費提供公費提供嘅法律免費服務，咁誒好多細節上面嘅嘢咧。頭先周浩鼎議員咧講得好啱，譬如話係咪廿四小時啦，喺邊一個地方去做呢樣嘢啦，誒等等嘅細節咧，其實仲係需要咧政府內部咧去進行一個詳細嘅審議，當中咧牽涉到可能一啲運作上。

682
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:29,570
嘅問題，亦都可能牽涉到啲財政上嘅問題嚇。咁而發援局嘅建議咧，基本上就喺文件上邊羅列咗。咁細節咧，仲係需要咧誒內部誒政府內部去審議，同埋咧發援局其實都有睇到嘅喺嗰個試驗計劃入邊咧，佢都建議我哋咧，就算真係做個試驗計劃咧，都係一年咧就要做一個中期檢討，兩年。

683
02:13:46,340 --> 02:14:06,350
唔該，主席，唔該，周員。O K，誒，周浩鼎議員，我只係一句補充啫，阿主席。誒，好簡單，即係我諗都係有一個詳細啲嘅評估，可以話到畀我聽，就會好啲。因為始終都牽涉到一個比較大嘅改動，我哋想了解實際嗰個情況究竟係點嘅。嚇，唔該。O K，係誒，跟住就。

684
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:27,960
哦，多謝主席。主席，我哋誒認為其實呢個計劃本身係正面嘅。我哋亦都認為呢個係爭取多年能夠從誒即係一開始進入咗一個需要法律嘅援助嘅時候，就能夠提供相應協助咧，係能夠有助誒獲取公義嘅噉。

685
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:47,970
具體而言咧，當然我係有少少想請教下誒局方誒四間具代表性嘅警處咧，我想了解佢哋係用乜嘢嘅準則係用代表性，即係例如係咪處理嘅個案係最多啊，定係點樣咧？我想呢度起碼有個基本嘅概念先，主席好。

686
02:14:47,970 --> 02:15:07,980
誒秘書長，誒楊議員，多謝你誒嘅問題。其實咧，嗯，抱歉咧，在細節上面咧，我哋係未有嘅，因為今日其實都係希望咧喺我哋內部審議嘅早期咧，早啲聽意見嚇。咁所以細節咧，我哋仲係需要喺政府內部審議。咁如果議員有咩建議咧，其實我哋都喺內部審議係樂意。

687
02:19:00,710 --> 02:19:01,590
啊。

688
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:44,150
就係。

689
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:42,670
我覺得即係誒誒。

690
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:07,840
有啲乜嘢嘅法律權利去保障自己？

691
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:32,200
誒冇追問咧，跟住就係，仲有邊位？

692
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:59,850
有幾多宗嘅扣留人數？如果落實呢個計劃，要誒，即係用每年用幾多錢啊？

693
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:25,390
噉樣就可以提早即係一條龍啦。由佢一開始需要嘅時候就已經能夠介入去協助，而唔係去到後期當佢被區分佢係屬於有保釋定冇保釋。咁呢一個我希望即係法援局可以慎重考慮嘅。而喺結束之前，主席，我申報我係一個刑事大律師。

694
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:27,990
咧係加二咧去考慮嘅。好，誒，因為我哋未瞭解到局方點諗咧，就咁具代表性咧，可能只係建基於剛才我提及係處理幾多位誒，即係簡單嚟講，拉咗幾多個案。嗯。咁可能係用數字嚟表達，咁呢個係咪最有效咧？我未。

695
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:40,930
喺刑事案件嘅時候咧，係要處理咗一大輪前期嘅工作，包括落口供，去到最後先至會考慮會唔會有保釋嘅，即係嗰位誒誒O C case嘅案件主管。噉我就想了解下，即係局方有冇呢方面嘅諗法，定係有背後其實有一個政策嘅原因，先至會有一。

696
02:16:43,080 --> 02:17:03,090
區分係拒絕保釋人士先至會獲誒誒呢個服務咧，主席係秘書長。多謝楊宇文，多謝主席。其實跟我哋理解咧，法援局個建議咧，其實嗰個大原則咧就係話，當每一個人個人身自由受到限制嘅時候咧，就可以有一個法律嘅支援咧，畀呢一位人士，係呢個佢嘅大原則。

697
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:23,100
噉佢呢個建議咧，我哋理解咧就係話，當如果佢被警方拒絕保釋，又或者咧佢根本係冇能力繳付保釋金，換句話嚟講，呢啲人士嗰個個人自由繼續受到呢個限制咧，咁咧就可以咧有關嘅服務可以擴展畀佢哋。但係如果係獲保釋嘅話咧，換句話嚟講，人身自由已經不再受限制啦。咁所以咧。

698
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:43,110
嗰個相關嗰個法律之誒援助服務咧，就唔會去擴展畀嗰啲人士。噉，但係我都想強調咧，就係咧呢個係法援局嘅建議。實際上點樣去做咧？正如我剛才講咧，仲係需要從長計議，同埋需要內部我哋政府入邊咧，仲係需要詳細去審議。好，主席嗱，見基於呢一點咧，我就想再畀個意見。

699
02:17:44,490 --> 02:18:04,500
如果我哋只係見機於一個人失去自由先至去提供協助咧，往往可能已經太遲。因為而家我哋本來當初希望喺警署提供服務咧，其實就係等相關嘅被拘捕人士一早已經知道自己嘅法律權利，乃至當佢需要落口供嘅時候，佢會知道自己。

700
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:53,660
跟住係啊，郭佩凡議員誒，多謝主席。呢個咧其實係一個即係誒，好好好重大嘅一個建議，即係影響好深遠啦。我想問下咧誒，即係睇睇文件咧好簡單啊，主席。即係誒，我想了解多啲，即係有冇你哋有冇考慮過個長程啊？誒嗱，每你有冇評估過每年有？

701
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,030
好過唔少先嚇。

702
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:37,110
其實係邊個講嘅咧？呢一小時，但係你又擺咗落個即係文件裏邊嘅喎。

703
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:31,710
唔超過一小時嘅呢個建議，因為我我自己感覺係覺得係即係好唔合理，或者即係即係好好離地啊嚇噉。

704
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:21,980
多謝主席，多謝國議員嘅問題。誒唔好抱歉，啊，佩議員，剛才我都提過咧，就係而家呢個建議咧係發換嗰個建議啊。噉我哋希望咧，借呢個機會咧係聽議員嘅意見。咁誒頭先國議員你講得好啱，好多細節嘅問題咧係需要考慮嘅嚇。頭先就提過，譬如話有冇上限啦，譬如頭先周啊周議員提過。

705
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:41,990
係咪廿四小時啊？呢啲都係一啲喺嗰個對誒政府嗰個運作啦，對政府嘅資源啦，都係可能有重大影響，係需要咧做出細節出嚟嘅，要做得細嘅呢樣嘢。如果真係我哋去推行嘅話，咁所以誒今日，但係我哋主要嚟到希望咧，喺早一啲嘅階段，喺我哋考慮審議嘅階段咧，已經咧早啲。

706
02:19:41,990 --> 02:20:02,000
聽到議員嘅意見，唔該。好，主要就係其實即係乜嘢資料，其實都未有嘅，即係一個概念嚟嘅啫。噉我都想問咧，嗱，譬如誒，但係裏邊就有有啲突然間就有少少資料嘅，例如咧就話即係意見認為唔應該超過一小時，即係大概畀一小時啦。咁噉，但係我我睇落咧，即係誒誒誒。

707
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:22,010
雖然我唔係律師，但係我周不時都有陪一啲誒，即係市民咧去報警嘅。噉我對上一次咧陪市民去報警，就一個關於家暴嘅個案咧。誒，淨係媽媽落口供都去咗四個鐘頭。噉我就想知道，即係你呢個一小時係邊啲人講出嚟？即係如何得出一個？

708
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:57,630
係，畀書長多謝多謝個議員嘅問題。其實誒文件第五B段嗰度嘅政治就係講法援局喺做呢個建議時候咧，佢哋考慮過嘅一啲嘅誒顧慮，亦都講咗啲法援局當時嘅意見。主流意見咧就係法援局喺考慮呢一個建議嘅時候咧，法援局主流嘅意見係為被扣留人士咧提供服務，唔應該。

709
02:20:57,630 --> 02:21:17,640
不超過一個鐘頭噉，但係呢個咧，我司法援局咧都唔係一個即係話已經一個決定一個decision，唔係一個conclusion嚟嘅噉。誒主席啊，咁法援局提出呢個不超過一個鐘頭，咁如果超過一個鐘頭嘅，你打算點嘅？噉佢都其實嗱，佢喺亦都喺個建議入邊咧，亦都有提到咧，就係話對一啲特定嘅案件或者情況特別嘅情況咧。

710
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:37,650
嗰個律師咧係可以延長嗰服務時間嘅。咁主席，其實呢個所謂不超過一個鐘頭係毫無意義嘅噃。啊，咁第二咧，我又想問法援局提出呢一個即係噉嘅建議之前咧，佢其實有冇諮詢過相關嘅執法部門？了唔瞭解即係究竟喺警署裏邊嗰個即係總體嗰個運作嘅咧？

711
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:57,710
好。誒，我哋嘅理解，法援局係有諮詢過誒相關嘅執法部門。係噉，係都得出呢個一小時嘅建議，所以我覺得都係幾匪夷所思。主席，我我覺得我好難去去去評論，即係支唔支持，因為即係資料實在太少，少到原來完全都唔知道。

712
02:21:57,710 --> 02:22:17,720
到可以即係點樣去做，定係知道咧？誒誒個影響可以好大，誒先牽涉嘅資源可能好多。誒噉，所以我覺得即係政府要即係詳細啲再考慮咯。好，仲有邊位？咁第二輪嘅第二輪誒，睇下先嚇。何君瑤第一輪，我畀何。

713
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:40,440
誒主席，我對呢一個噉嘅建議咧，我就誒唔反對嘅，因為剛才都話齋喺legal aid service嚟講，我哋香港都基本上政府唔設上限，都係要盡量去保障誒個人嘅嗰個誒人權嘅問題。噉啊，而家就只不過我就想提出咧，就畀阿阿李。

714
02:22:40,440 --> 02:23:00,450
李生考慮下咧，因為誒喺目前嚟講，一般嚟講，我哋legal aid咧就係district court or above咁先有。如果係以下嘅咧，我哋係duty lawyer scheme嘅。咁duty lawyer scheme咪處理曬所有magistrate case咁誒咁嗰度嚟講，一年嘅經費大概一億元啦，連埋嗰個誒行政費用。

715
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:24,780
誒，我諗誒。

716
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:47,310
誒律師大律師咧，係拒絕去做。

717
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:29,270
周係呢個呢個議題嘅係嘛？好，周偉鼎議員。

718
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:44,370
當事律師服務嘅嗰個list咧就申言過去，除非即係嗰啲相關嘅。

719
02:25:40,650 --> 02:25:48,420
秘書長，誒多謝何議員嘅誒意見。喺我哋考慮嘅過程咧，我哋會加以考慮誒頭先律議員提出嘅寶貴意見。

720
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:38,210
誒，如果最尾真係會好似誒，無論係當事律師定係法援，都係要on list嘅話咧，其實就容易啲咧，就係將。

721
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:22,050
好，咁仲有就係其他一啲員提到個時數係咪夠啊？其他呢啲好實際啦嚇，因為好多人都會陪個啲市民去報警啊，或者喺噉嘅情況，一定好容易一一下子都已經三個鐘頭。

722
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:20,580
咁legal aid就大概七億幾，剛才就係愛嚟去做legal aid funding，但係另外仲有administrative，所以八億幾咁個比例嚟講一對八倍到啦，大概噉。突突然之間，而家似乎legal aid誒advisory council咧就話：，喂，不如我哋做做多啲啊！我我基本上唔反對你使多啲，最後都係公家錢，亦都係保障。

723
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:40,590
人權問題，只不過喺個架構方面講要協調下啦。既然如果你喺誒誒警警局裏邊嘅detainee，我哋有legal A去做，咁會唔會又好似即係唔係好銜接咧？因為district court or below嗰啲，district court or above我哋先legal A㗎嘛。

724
02:23:40,590 --> 02:24:00,600
咁而家呢個未進入嗰個所謂叫做誒工作誒檢控嘅或者係個誒誒訴訟程序，我哋又插隻手落去以legal aid嚟去做咧，噉我覺得又唔係咁理想。如果將來要做咧，我感覺上係咪應該畀duty lawyer scheme去做會好啲咧？呢個第一個嘅嗰個喺個系統性嘅偏

725
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:20,610
排個邏輯性會比較通順啲。第二咧就誒，我見到你而家就初步建議就話，如果畀人哋落咗charge嗰啲咧，我哋就唔會畀佢啊。只不過係誒，自願行去差館啊，又或者係啱啱咪畀人拘留啊，或者拒保嗰啲嘢，我哋就會畀佢咁嗱。呢一個咧誒，係咪淨係侷限於一個鐘？

726
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:40,620
鐘頭去差館，閒閒地企喺度等個waiting time又計唔計咧？因為我按call嘅時候去到嘅時候，必定可能等等成半粒鐘或以上咁啦。呢啲要點樣協調？咁至於你講到第三浸咧，就話要佢有個叫做分擔費，由五百至到一千，我都冇反對。但係實際上呢啲人咧，佢係冇水嘅，好多都係嗰啲。

727
02:24:40,620 --> 02:25:00,630
啲如果係過期居留啊，或者immigration嗰啲咧，打親電話嚟嗰啲，我哋見到有。目前咧，我哋律師會有四十五分鐘嘅免費法律嘅諮詢服務啦。咁誒誒，有超過成一百間律師樓去提供嘅。咁嗱，我我周不時都接到呢電話，但係我一定唔得閒做。佢call出嚟啲時間都唔係一個方便。

728
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:20,640
嘅時間係深夜，咁所以你究竟如果想推動嘅時候咧，你會係又畀啲咩誘因佢做咧？即係參加呢個scheme嘅人，因為佢佢佢剝奪咗自己嘅私人時間㗎啦嘛，犧牲咗啦嘛，咁所以呢一度咧要詳細諗。我我表示支持，但係你要抌幾多錢落去，將來如果係要放嘅時候，邊？

729
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:40,650
個去經營咧，去行誒運行咧，運作咧，噉係咪應該Julie Loi Scheme會好啲咁多咧？如果係嘅，將會你allocation嘅分定畀佢，會唔會喺一億元裏邊，我會抌多三千萬落去做呢樣嘢？咁如果係的，我將來嘅發展你有冇把握精算啲？嗱，呢個我就係提供意見畀你考慮嘅啫嚇。多謝。好。

730
02:25:48,700 --> 02:26:08,710
好噉，跟住就係第二輪嘅楊樂橋議員三分鐘。誒，主席，其實我都正正係想誒建議啊。何君瑤議員剛才嘅觀察嘅誒，大部分嘅刑事案件其實都會喺裁判法院度已經處理。咁如果論銜接咧，因為如果都係可能係同一份。

731
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:28,720
paper啫嘛，咁嗰份form噉，我講緊即係喺digital law service用嘅啲都係嗰啲form嚟。咁如果可以早啲係同一套咧，就省卻咗好多文書嘅同埋即係轉介啊嗰啲嘅時間同埋費用。噉我希望即係各方都考慮一下。誒，第二咧就係嗰個。

732
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:25,360
OK。

733
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:26,670
請。

734
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:30,380
係主席。

735
02:31:27,470 --> 02:31:28,500
佢專業。

736
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:19,850
好係，你好啊！

737
02:30:20,310 --> 02:30:23,480
願意繼續同我哋委員會嘅成員繼續瞭解。

738
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:52,560
同埋咧，就係括弧零七，係立法會秘書處而以有關題目嘅背景資料。

739
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:16,870
點解我剛才喺介紹文件嘅時候，喺開初嘅時候都提到咧，我哋係需要咧好審慎去研究呢個議題嚇。

740
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:23,980
跟住我哋會請大律師公會嘅代表Mister Graham Harris或者係羅佩賢大律師係同我哋發言嘅嚇。

741
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:31,880
咁咧就跟住係我哋今日嘅議程最後一個項目，就係誒法治與檢控人員嘅角色。

742
02:30:52,840 --> 02:31:01,930
而家首先咧，我哋係請副刑事檢控專員許兆鼎資深大律師同我哋介紹文件。

743
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:45,590
咁咧就係相關文件係C B括弧四一三八六足十六-hi分十七括弧零六係政府當局提為法治與檢控人員嘅角色嘅文件。

744
02:26:47,590 --> 02:27:07,600
誒警處支援嘅啫，咁噉樣嘅話咧，就因為同一批都係比較多經驗嘅，噉佢哋去做埋咧，我覺得係會比較合適啫。主席喺呢啲意見，唔該曬。好誒，局方有冇回應？誒，多多係同一樣嘅。多謝楊宇嘅意見喺我哋考慮落嘅時候咧，我哋一定會加以考慮啊。

745
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:49,710
啊！多謝主席，只係問多一句啫。咁誒，想請教下咧，即係到時如果真係執行起上嚟嘅時候咧，啊，警署佢內部啊嘅安排，包括佢自己本身嗰啲房間啊等等嘅安排，有冇需要有任何嘅配合同埋改動咧？因為我就喺度諗嗱。

746
02:27:49,710 --> 02:28:09,720
撇除電話中心個安排啊，電話中心係一種安排啦。咁但係誒親自面對面嘅嗰個嘅見面嘅安排咧，噉我相信啊，你都諗到即係可能係可能突然之間有好多嘅誒被拘留人士同時間需要呢個服務，噉啊同時間可能需要一啲嘅房間去即塞。

747
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:29,730
做到呢啲嘅安排，即係同平時有所不同啦。即係當然平時可以自己有自己嘅安排，而家因為誒如果有咗呢個計劃，我相信可能更多人可以享受到呢個服務。咁但係我就想問埋咧，就係話到時嗰個警處啊，能即係嗰啲房嘅安排能唔能夠配合到？要點樣做？點樣處理？即係誒我。

748
02:28:29,730 --> 02:28:49,740
就睇下局方會唔會都有呢方面嘅考慮，或者會唔會已經同警方嗰邊咧有相當嘅誒溝通，即係瞭解咗點樣準備咁解嚇。唔該啊，副秘書長周議員嘅問題，或者我好簡單講一講，睇下保安局嘅同事有冇嘢補充誒？呢個好視乎嗰個實踐個計劃。當然，如果我哋真係決定去做嘅話，噉嘅細節係點樣咧？

749
02:28:49,740 --> 02:29:09,750
具體操作係點樣做法咧？咁如果誒喺個操作係譬如話需要到一啲嘅可能獨立房間嘅話咧，自然就會阿周議員提個剛才嘅問題係咪需要做警署做一啲改建啊、改動啊噉樣？咁所以咧，呢啲亦都係對嗰個可能係警方嘅操作啦、運作啦，甚至係一啲財政上邊咧都係有個影響，所以就。

750
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:40,290
唔該，主席。誒，我或者都補充一下，其實誒，阿周議員問嗰個問題問得好啱嘅。我哋執法機關即係睇緊誒依個噉嘅建議嘅時候咧，誒做緊內部討論嘅時候，我哋都喺度睇咧，因為我哋估，因為係一個免費嘅服務，亦都可能係誒不設一個篩選啊，即係任何人可能都可以要求呢啲噉嘅服務。噉我哋與

751
02:29:40,290 --> 02:30:00,300
計會好多人用嘅噉，對於誒警署或者其他執法機關嗰啲場所咧，佢佢哋個場地設施啦、人手啦、保安安排啦、誒電話啦、誒佢哋個翻譯嘅人手足唔足夠啦，甚至當值即係嚟嚟啊嚟到警署去提供服務嗰啲律師會唔會足唔足夠咧？會唔會影響到嗰啲基樓人士？

752
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:20,310
要延長個機流時間等等咧，我哋都好關注。咁依家政府內部的確係做緊一啲討論，我哋要小心研究呢啲問題。好多謝阿曾月同副秘書長。如果冇其他嘅意見咧，我哋就結束呢一個議題。多謝大家出席。噉啊，有啲未傾完嘅嘢咧，我哋可以繼續喺會外繼續跟進嚇。我相信局方都好願。

753
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,300
不受任何嘅干涉。

754
02:33:20,890 --> 02:33:22,700
以求尊重法治。

755
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:25,780
首先咧，就係法治呢個議題。

756
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:02,940
不受任何其他因素幹擾。

757
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:41,160
係獲到憲法層面嘅一啲保障。

758
02:33:17,330 --> 02:33:20,610
遵從檢控守則，同埋考慮所有嘅證據。

759
02:32:55,930 --> 02:33:00,130
律政司嘅一啲常規同埋政策獨立行事。

760
02:32:26,330 --> 02:32:30,600
刑事司法制度咧，係香港法律制度最重要嘅一個環節。

761
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:55,650
檢控人員履行檢控工作嘅時間咧，係會依法同埋按照。

762
02:33:03,950 --> 02:33:09,110
就住我哋嘅常規同埋一啲政策咧，我哋有一個檢控嘅手則。

763
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:37,660
亦都係香港法治嘅基礎，而獨立檢控咧就係法治基礎其中一個重要嘅元素。

764
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:48,440
基本法第六十三條咧，將定明香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢控工作。

765
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:17,050
檢控人員咧就任何案件作出刑事檢控決定嘅時間咧，係會一貫引用適用嘅法律。

766
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:23,090
我首先咧會向各位咧簡介我哋提交嘅一啲文件，然後咧就歡迎各位咧就就住我哋處理檢控時嘅一啲原則嘅問題咧作出提問。

767
02:31:54,750 --> 02:32:13,550
向委員簡介誒法治呢個重要嘅原則，以及檢控人員為維維維為維護呢一個原則所擔當嘅角色，等委員同埋公眾咧對律政司處理檢控事宜呢啲常規同埋政策咧有一個更深入嘅瞭解。

768
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:54,750
主席，誒法治與檢控人員嘅角色呢個討論嘅議題咧，誒係回應早前有委員對檢控當局處理某一些案件誒嘅檢控工作嘅一啲關注。誒雖然我哋不宜喺呢個場合咧就公開評論個別案件嘅處理啦，誒，但係我希望可以透過。

769
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:20,240
第一。

770
02:34:08,470 --> 02:34:10,050
作出檢控嘅決定。

771
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,430
檢控人員嘅獨立性。

772
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:42,540
程序同埋嘅政策。

773
02:33:30,570 --> 02:33:33,340
檢控守則係一套聲明同埋指令。

774
02:34:10,330 --> 02:34:13,230
同埋處理檢控程序中各個步驟。

775
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:58,820
守則詳述咗，財政司喺修飾。

776
02:33:59,550 --> 02:34:02,810
執法機構提交嘅調查結果之後。

777
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:41,880
有關嘅因素，亦都詳列咗喺我哋討論文件嘅第七段。

778
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:48,050
等到我哋檢控人員可以按住一個既有嘅框框架行事。

779
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:08,190
檢控人員應該點樣向執法機構提供法律意見？

780
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:19,000
我希望藉呢個機會指出幾個我哋特別強調嘅重點。

781
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:39,910
明確同埋清晰噉樣定明咗律政司喺進行刑事檢控。

782
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:55,050
指引檢控人員應該點樣去維護法治，係守則嘅根本概念。

783
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:29,930
並且確保公公平審訊，同埋有關有關各方均能獲得公平嘅對待。

784
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:37,650
手則裏面咧特別指出，檢控人員肩負獨立、秉行公義者呢個重要嘅角色，公正、理智噉樣去行事，唔應該受到各種因素影響我哋嘅檢控決定。

785
02:34:50,450 --> 02:34:51,420
第二點。

786
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:28,970
嘅調查工作。

787
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:42,150
就住法律控罪。

788
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:31,820
律政司喺修飾。

789
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:11,290
同埋主管刑事檢控嘅工作。

790
02:35:14,690 --> 02:35:16,950
進行刑事嘅調查。

791
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:14,410
律政司並無權力。

792
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,290
香港嘅執法機關負責刑事調查嘅工作。

793
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:27,470
但係唔可以掌管或者指揮執法機構。

794
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:53,360
第三點重點，我哋要強調嘅就係我哋點樣去作出個檢控嘅決定。

795
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:56,740
檢控人員同埋執法機構、執法機關嘅一啲分工。

796
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:22,750
喺適當嘅情況底下，檢控人員可以要求作進一步嘅調查。

797
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:47,770
證證據程序同埋其他有關方面咧，係給予法律指引。

798
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:08,910
律政司則負責向政府各個決策局啦，同埋部門提供法律指引。

799
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:49,440
檢控人員嘅角色、職務同埋處事嘅原則，亦都喺我哋嘅檢控守則裏面咧，清楚噉樣定明。

800
02:35:32,250 --> 02:35:39,620
執法機構要求提供法律指引之後咧，係會根據我哋嘅檢控守則同埋適用嘅法律。

801
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,340
並平衡。

802
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:14,180
達至定罪。

803
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:07,890
嘅基準係相符嘅。

804
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:16,820
如果案件符合上述，

805
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,780
所有公眾利益嘅議題。

806
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:24,000
檢控人員隨後咧，係必須考慮。

807
02:37:00,270 --> 02:37:03,750
以上就係我哋處理檢控工作嘅一啲基本原則。

808
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:21,020
是否有充分證據？呢一個驗證標準。

809
02:36:01,830 --> 02:36:05,840
呢個做法咧，亦同其他普通法適用嘅地區。

810
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:12,700
而驗證嘅標準咧，就係是否有合理機會。

811
02:36:37,290 --> 02:36:43,290
此外，檢控人員有責任咧，持續複核已經展開咗嘅一啲檢控工作。

812
02:35:54,490 --> 02:36:01,460
檢控人員咧考慮應否提出檢控嘅時間咧，必須首先考慮係咪有充分嘅證據。

813
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:51,270
假如隨著情況有變，有關嘅證據不足以確保有合理定罪。

814
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:59,420
合合理機會達至定罪咧，或者繼續進行檢控係不符合社會公義，我哋就有責任停止檢控。

815
02:36:28,670 --> 02:36:36,760
就住呢兩項驗證標準所需要考慮嘅因素咧，喺我哋嘅討論文件第十五同埋第十七段咧，係已經詳列咗出嚟。

816
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:14,510
喺文件嘅格付嘅一個檢控手則裏面咧，亦都有詳細嘅章節，係講述檢控人員應該點樣去處理檢控程序中各個步驟。

817
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:20,380
to。

818
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:35,090
okay，啊。

819
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:23,270
What Martin Hoiers had to say.

820
02:38:23,550 --> 02:38:26,840
and as long as the code is kept to.

821
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:30,790
We see this as as not a problem.

822
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:22,850
同埋某一啲值得關注嘅特別嘅案件。

823
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:19,060
刑事法庭程序嘅各個當事人、當事方。

824
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:29,420
歡迎大家係參考，公眾亦可以從律政司嘅網頁咧下載呢一個檢控守則。

825
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:15,990
牽涉到就係話檢控官就不能夠喺作檢控決定嘅時候受啊多種嘅因素影響啦。

826
02:39:16,270 --> 02:39:24,680
一點四段啊，講我哋嘅係誒上訴法庭喺一件案件裏邊就誒。

827
02:37:51,160 --> 02:38:00,610
To the panel, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We really don't have too much to say because, to us, there isn't much in the paper that is new.

828
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:39,580
如果各位對我哋處理檢控工作有邊方面有任任何嘅問題咧，我同我嘅同事咧係樂意為大家作出進一步解釋。多謝各位。

829
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:50,800
多謝許專員。而家咧，我哋係請大律師公會嘅代表Mr. Graham Harris係，May you give your opinion？

830
02:38:35,370 --> 02:38:49,690
阿羅佩賢大律師係，誒，幾點嘅啫？我諗係，我諗即係最主要，可以各位議員可以咧，就睇嗰個係嘅檢控守則裏邊特別關關於係啊。

831
02:38:50,010 --> 02:39:07,790
檢控官嗰個獨立性啊，同埋係即係檢控嘅獨立方面，即係基本法保障嗰度呢啲啊呢方面嘅內容咧，噉就喺嗰個嘅手則裏邊嘅第一點二段咧，裏邊嗰個即係。

832
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:18,920
I was a prosecutor in the Department of Justice in the eighties and nineties. I think probably the only thing that is different in terms of concept is it's all now codified and you can read it on the internet. We don't really have anything to add.

833
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:08,960
係，誒，羅佩璇大律師係。

834
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:12,810
誒已經根據咧係誒。

835
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:17,680
誒，你你你其實可以。

836
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:27,920
檢控係經過充足，經過係有。

837
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:09,680
即係確保嚟講，嗰個檢控過程咧係啊。

838
02:41:09,410 --> 02:41:14,400
主席讓我答呢個問題，我就我就我就只有四廿答。你你可以，你可以話。

839
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:23,830
請啊，政府都可以答嘅。不過佢係啊，郭議員好希望聽下你嘅意見嚇。

840
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:39,180
以展示充足嘅證據，啊，喺一個公平程序底下嚟講咧，係去完成，跟住由司法機關作出一個咧，係啊。

841
02:40:13,090 --> 02:40:29,030
證據去檢控咧，同埋嚟講係公平地去檢控等等。噉啊，呢度有幾個嘅觀察可以畀各位議員參考。唔該曬。嗯，好，多謝羅大律師。而家係委員發問嘅時間，第一位係阿郭佩凡議員。

842
02:40:49,320 --> 02:41:05,870
自檢控就話咧有人誒，即係誒而家嘅誒，即係有啲檢控咧，就係政府作為一個政治工具去打壓異己。噉我想聽下誒羅羅大壯嘅意見，就係其實你觀察香港有冇噉嘅情況出現咧？

843
02:39:46,350 --> 02:40:04,650
清楚係誒檢控官就嗰個嘅工作嚇，佢嗰個職能並不是嚟講咧，就係為咗係去就係取得一個嘅定罪咁簡單嘅啊，而係嚟講係啊，係去咧啊。

844
02:41:24,110 --> 02:41:43,340
誒呢一方面就誒始終我哋即係都係睇一啲嘅係新聞報道咁有有啲嘅係個別人士作出一啲嘅係意見啊喺度話誒一啲嘅係檢控嘅決定係有一啲嘅係問題。

845
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:46,350
檢控工作方面嗰個嘅獨立性啊嘅係評論啦，以及嚟講咧就係啊嗰個嘅啊檢控官嗰個嘅角色嗰度咧喺第三點二段關於一個係啊加拿大嘅案例裏邊咧係我講得好。

846
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:49,320
係啊，誒多謝主席。誒，我都認同我頭先羅大律師所講咧，其實即係誒最重要嘅咧，就係誒即係檢控人員嗰個獨立檢控個獨立性。咁咧就誒，我想請教啊啊啊羅大壯咧，就係最近咧就誒社會上面不斷都有講咧，就係話即係指控政府咧就話有政。

847
02:41:43,620 --> 02:42:03,630
噉就啊，我諗最容易去啊啊，可以好容易去講呢啲嘅啊嘅嘅意見出嚟，亦都會好容易咧，就係有一個嘅係啊啲意見被報導。誒，始終咧就係啊，我哋就一定程度上係要啊信任。

848
02:42:03,630 --> 02:42:23,640
咧係檢控當局係去咧係遵守佢哋嘅係誒檢控嘅守則，最後咧係嗰個嘅檢控啊係咪誒成立咧？我哋係有獨立嘅係司法機關啊，去確保嚟講咧呢個嘅係檢。

849
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:40,240
判決。

850
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:55,970
去考慮。

851
02:43:09,820 --> 02:43:11,240
誒許主任。

852
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:54,640
嘅框架就係必須從證據。

853
02:43:06,220 --> 02:43:09,500
特首可唔可以要求律政司撤銷檢控？

854
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:05,640
正司撤控啦，即係已經提出咗檢控嘅誒案例。

855
02:44:36,310 --> 02:44:43,300
對任何檢控決定誒裏面所誒諗嘅一啲誒議題，好下一位議員，何君瑤議員。

856
02:42:40,740 --> 02:43:00,750
咁呢個判決當然最後有上訴機關去啊監察嘅。係主席好。咁如果係阿格佩凡議員先問，誒律政司對即係律政司代表啦嚇，你對呢個即係誒一啲噉樣嘅指控，你哋有啲咩回應？同埋咧，我特別想問一個問題，我想問咧就誒香港嘅行政長官可唔可以要求誒律？

857
02:43:11,530 --> 02:43:31,540
誒多謝郭議員呢個問題。誒，我哋誒律政司裏面所有刑事檢控科嘅同事，同埋其他司內嘅同事咧，一直都秉持住誒我哋啲一個獨立檢控，同埋必須要係公平公正噉樣去處理每一宗嘅刑事嘅案件。咁誒，我可以話到。

858
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:51,550
好誒，畀誒委員誒各位議員同埋公眾聽咧，就係我哋司內咧絕無一啲誒偏頗，或者係從一個政治方向去決定誒一個檢控嘅決定呢一啲情況出現。我哋純粹咧就係秉持住我哋檢控守則裡面所規範住我哋。

859
02:43:56,290 --> 02:44:16,300
絕無任何嘅政治嘅一啲誒議題咧，係深入咗我哋誒作一個檢控嘅一啲誒決定裏面嘅作為任何嘅基礎。咁至於國議員頭先提到嗰個誒行政長官有冇誒任何嘅誒可能咧，係會係影響到我哋呢一個誒檢控嘅決定咧？誒我可以。

860
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:36,310
答咧係誒冇一個噉樣可能，因為我哋律政司係受住《基本法》第六十三條咧，我哋呢一個檢控咧係不受任何嘅幹預誒，包括從政府內部或者係從公眾誒，或者係從一啲輿論壓力裏面咧，畀我哋任何嘅壓力咧，都唔係我哋唔會係我哋考。

861
02:44:45,450 --> 02:45:05,460
主席啊，我就基本上係好認同而家我哋嗰個檢控手則裏邊所講嘅嘢。當然係我哋律政律政司檢控科嘅咧，亦都係獨立運著運作，係秉公辦理嘅。噉啊，當然啊，就我亦都知道嗰個一般嘅嗰啲原則性，只不過我想提出有一個問題咧。

862
02:45:05,460 --> 02:45:25,470
咧justice deny誒deny justice justice denied噉樣，咁喺嗰個問題方面嚟講，如果有疑誤啦，疑誤嘅問題出自於係究竟乜嘢咧？咁當然我哋好好相信律政司會自己會處理，但係當客觀地睇到有啲案件超過兩年或者三年都唔去唔去。

863
02:45:25,470 --> 02:45:45,480
去去去檢控或者係冇一個交代的話，咁喺呢一方面嚟講係點樣去平衡翻個公眾利益嘅問題？我而家講喺嗰個檢控守則裏邊五點八，其中D嗰度亦都有講就話檢控有否有任何嘅疑誤或者係其他因由咁嗱？呢一度你哋會點樣平衡同埋？

864
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:14,030
咁誒，我可以誒。

865
02:48:14,310 --> 02:48:18,140
講咧就係我哋書裏面咧，就住一啲誒。

866
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:22,810
重大嘅案件咧，係需要好全面噉樣去考慮所。

867
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:31,220
檢控率都係得嗰啊大概三十個percent到，而嗰度嘅。

868
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:10,980
冇問題咧，就啊，我繼續啊，我先宣佈咧，我哋最多就延十五分鐘嚇。周浩鼎議員。

869
02:45:45,480 --> 02:46:05,490
喺自己嘅部門裏邊，有冇邊個守則會話？嗱，一般嚟講，我哋都係好講效率嘅。噉啊，有好多嘢已經係誒好清晰啊，無論係新聞裏邊又好，或者咩都好，嗰啲係一個基本嘅誒參考嘅證據。但係我哋都要睇翻誒警方調查人員嘅。

870
02:46:05,490 --> 02:46:25,500
嗰個報告咁喺噉嘅情況裏邊，我哋會唔會話我哋期望會喺誒半年啊、十二個月啊、誒十誒十八個月啊等等嗰個嗰個進度點樣交代咧？噉我而家to be more specific講佔中嘅問題啦，一千零三十幾宗案件裏邊咧，而家個結

871
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:51,510
唔談嗰個其他嘅誒誒嗰個入罪率與否嘅問題，淨係單純咧係處理嗰個嗰個幅度咧個效率咧，我覺得都係好唔理想噉。或者我唔清楚誒專員，你喺呢一方面可唔可以誒幫幫誒公司本會而家嗰個情況，你點recancel係五點八D嗰個公眾利益？

872
02:46:51,510 --> 02:47:11,520
個問題，多謝許專員。係誒，多謝何議員呢個誒問題。誒就住個別嘅案件咧，我哋誒不宜咧喺呢一個場合嗰度咧，就係作出誒一啲誒具體嘅評論。誒，但我可以誒向何議員誒就誒再一個保證咧，就係我哋司裏面誒每一位刑事檢控科嘅同事咧。

873
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:31,530
都係誒竭盡所能咧，就住每一宗案件，因應每一宗案件嘅性質不同同埋複雜性不同咧，係會誒積極噉樣咧，係誒就住個案件咧，係需要作任何檢控決定咧，我哋係會全面去誒去考慮同埋去作出決定。誒至於頭先海員誒提到誒有啲。

874
02:47:31,530 --> 02:47:51,540
情況底下咧，可能一個誒案件嘅疑誤，導致到咧就係誒可能嗰個公義上面咧係有所誒一個減損誒呢一個原則咧，喺所有普通法嘅誒一啲誒司法誒管轄區底下咧，我哋都係有確認到呢一個原則。但係咧誒每一種案件所適用嘅誒。

875
02:47:51,540 --> 02:48:11,550
或者所需要嘅時間，誒嗰個性質同埋個複雜程度咧，係因應各個案件有不同。咁所以我哋唔可以用同一把尺，就係話誒某一個誒時期某一個時間咧，就係適用所有嘅案件。誒呢樣嘢亦都係誒唔係一個誒合適嘅一個誒標準。咁

876
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:43,100
誒所有嘅正功，所有嘅相應適用嘅法律，同埋咧就係要全盤噉樣去睇每一宗案件。誒，亦都係用我哋刑事檢控守則裏面咧誒同一把尺去作出一個檢控嘅決定，去衡量究竟我哋應否作出檢控，同埋個誒時間係誒應該係幾時檢控。咁呢個係我嘅回應。

877
02:48:43,470 --> 02:49:03,480
好啊，跟住就係阿周浩鼎議員誒。我喺呢度咧必須問一問，因為我哋剩翻五分鐘誒，所以咧就如果畀大家問曬，可能啊誒都要用多誒五五分鐘到十分鐘嘅，你介唔介意我言會喺呢一度？係如果冇。

878
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:31,450
啊！多謝主席。啊，我只係一個好簡單嘅意見啫。噉就我對於啊律政司同埋同事咧，係秉承嗰個誒檢控係絕對獨立同埋唔受其他嘅因素影響咧，呢個專業性獨立性咧，我係絕對相信，亦都係好有信心嘅。噉啊，早前一段時間。

879
02:49:31,450 --> 02:49:51,460
間咧，因為有啲參與佔領行動嘅人士咧就被啊啊起訴，噉佢哋當然就會話咧係誒政治檢控，咁但係呢一種咧，我相信啊呢種指控咧係會對律政司咧同埋對律政司嘅同事咧，我相信都會構成啊一定嘅抹黑嚟嘅，噉我就覺。

880
02:49:51,460 --> 02:50:11,470
覺得咧，借呢個機會，我自己都表達一個意見咧，就係話我對於香港嘅法律制度、對於律政司同埋啲同事嘅採取嗰個檢控嘅呢個工作嘅獨立性、同專業性同中立性咧，啊，唔受任何嘅政治因素同其他因素影響咧，我係絕對有信心，亦都唔希望咧再聽到呢啲噉樣嘅。

881
02:51:02,270 --> 02:51:02,970
係。

882
02:53:40,210 --> 02:53:41,130
誒。

883
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:39,590
許專員。

884
02:50:56,950 --> 02:51:00,500
誒嗰個誒律政署裏邊去誒去解決。

885
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:16,640
所謂政治檢控嘅呢種嘅抹黑嘅，我凈係一個意見啫，啊，主席。

886
02:52:23,650 --> 02:52:31,000
誒，你哋係咪會誒誒現時嚟講都係用外判嘅嚟嚟減輕咗你哋嘅工作量？

887
02:52:31,290 --> 02:52:40,650
誒去做咧噉樣，即係突然間佢咁多嘅時候，你就會爭撥啦，就唔係你行上嗰啲裁判、在magistrate court嗰啲嘅外判嚇。

888
02:53:21,130 --> 02:53:37,750
跟住翻我頭先嘅問題咧，我想我想問一問誒誒專員誒誒，如果而家咧有人咧就係提出就係誒要求嚇，即係誒律政司唔一定唔可以檢控某一啲可能涉嫌犯犯罪嘅人，咁會唔會涉嫌妨礙司法公證？

889
02:50:16,930 --> 02:50:36,940
咁咧就啊，反為我我而家係我嘅時間，我想問少少嘅啫，即係啊，其實我哋就比較多見到咧民事啊啊，或者係公法啦嚇，行政法啊、司法複係案件咧，你哋會外判出去啦。咁亦都都係好大嘅官司啦嚇。咁喺刑事咧，即係你哋有咁大量嘅有啲個別案件。

890
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:56,950
或者近日都經常有啲好多眾多嘅案件，可能每一個處境都唔同嘅，要處理係case by case basis，即係一個一個案件嚟處理嘅。噉你哋係嗰個外判嘅情況係多唔多嘅？其實即係處理啲咁大量嘅案件嘅時候，係咪會外判咗出去，定係都係由你哋自己？

891
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:23,620
專員嚇係誒，我哋係有外判誒案件嘅一啲誒需要嘅，因為我哋司裡面誒刑事檢控科裡面咧就誒誒，我哋嘅檢控官嘅人員咧就係誒一百三十多位，噉係冇可能做曬我哋司裡面咧誒每誒日誒每日要處理嘅一啲案件，咁所以我哋入。

892
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:43,630
有需要係要外判誒一一部分嘅案件，咁至於誒具體嘅情況，我哋誒點樣去決定外判咩案件，同埋有啲咩案件我哋係覺得需要外判咧？誒呢個係誒取決於每一宗案件嘅性質同埋個複雜性。咁當然有一啲重要重大嘅案件嘅時間，同埋考慮到誒例如。

893
02:51:43,630 --> 02:52:03,640
牽涉到一啲重要嘅法律誒觀點，同埋個誒比較係誒個案情亦都係複雜嘅，咁同埋睇我哋司裏面有冇一個誒合適或者適合嘅誒同事去處理嘅時間咧，我哋係需要衡量究竟我哋誒就某一啲案件係咪需要外判，咁亦都恆常地咧誒，例如喺裁判法院。

894
02:52:03,640 --> 02:52:23,650
每一日都會有好大量嘅案件係誒進行，咁喺嗰啲案件行上地，我哋亦都有需要咧，係外判一啲案件畀誒誒外間嘅大律師。不如我直接啲問咧，即係如果你哋當突然間嚇出現咗好大量嘅案件，你哋又要選擇唔係一即係佢唔又又係要一個個處理嘅時候，誒？

895
02:52:41,110 --> 02:53:01,120
係主席，誒咁當然啦。如果係誒突然間有一個大量嘅工作量誒係增加嘅時間咧，我哋司裏面嘅人手當然係誒係未必應付得嚟。咁如果係噉嘅情況底下咧，我哋當然會就住誒我哋誒手頭嘅案件去作一個誒，無論係性質啦、複雜性啦，同埋有冇一啲特別。

896
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:21,130
需要係我哋司裏面嘅同事誒去自己處理翻，去調撥我哋嘅人手。咁呢樣嘢咧係當然會誒誒某程度可能會影響到我哋個人手調撥。咁但係誒最終就係視乎每一宗案件嘅誒獨立情況，我哋去決定嘅。好係咪郭佩凡議員仲上第二輪？係郭佩凡議員，多謝主席。誒。

897
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:26,270
誒。

898
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:24,630
係許專員。

899
02:55:21,460 --> 02:55:22,960
香港嘅法治咧。

900
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:44,600
個暑假，多謝你哋，多謝。

901
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:31,270
多謝郭議員誒頭先嘅問題誒，當然啦，我哋誒。

902
02:55:52,050 --> 02:56:03,390
作出判決嘅時間咧，係維持翻我哋檢控當局同埋法院嘅一個獨立性。呢個我覺得係一定係誒係好重要嘅。咁法治其中兩個最重嘅元素就係呢樣嘢。

903
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:20,120
好，誒噉我哋咧就係問曬問題啦，咁畀你哋最後有誒睇下嗱，許專員頭先答咗咁多，睇下有冇需要再補充啦，或者Mr. Graham Harris and Mr. Low，whether you would like to add on the opinion today in this section？

904
02:53:41,410 --> 02:54:01,420
就住誒一個噉樣嘅誒誒問題咧，我哋誒當然要了解誒每一宗誒個案裏面一啲誒嗰個仔細嘅情況係點樣樣啦。誒一個基本嘅法律原則咧，就係誒我哋作出檢控決定嘅時間咧，歸根究底就係要考慮翻我哋有否證據。

905
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:21,430
呢個係第一步，證據是否足以支持一個合理定罪機會？第二步就係考慮咧，誒有冇一個誒公眾利益嘅一個平衡。如果公眾利益係認為需要檢控嘅話咧，我哋係會誒秉持我哋呢一個誒既定嘅一個政策同埋原則，係一個法。

906
02:54:21,430 --> 02:54:41,440
嘅原則噉，我哋係會決定去檢控噉，所以誒唔存在咧，就係話我哋誒受到有任何誒一啲要求話誒要承諾唔作出檢控咧，我哋就會係誒不理誒任何嘅細節同埋任何嘅理由咧，就作出呢個承諾呢樣嘢係唔會發生嘅。噉我亦都要強調咧。

907
02:54:41,440 --> 02:55:01,450
咧就係我哋司裏面係誒誒永遠都係誒一個誒獨立嘅誒檢控決定，誒我哋不受任何其他誒一個誒唔應該考慮嘅一啲誒因素去幹擾我哋嘅檢控決定。主席，好，係得，許凡議員，我就想問咧，而家咧即係有一啲嘅誒誒人士啦嚇，甚至法律界。

908
