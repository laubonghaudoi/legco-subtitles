1
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,460
規程納入。

2
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,820
考慮相關嘅因素。

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,940
誒，各位傳媒界嘅朋友。

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,960
根據立法會嘅慣例咧。

5
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,410
我只會決定是否佢哋合符。

6
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,790
啊！過去上一個星期咧，我收到十。

7
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,600
委議事規則委員會同埋內會審議之後咧。

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,280
對於已時規則嘅修改係會經過三步曲。

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,730
第一就先提交議事規則委員會作研究，研究之後咧就應相。

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:18,400
委員提供提交咗大概三十多項修改議事規則嘅議決議案。

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:56,870
我作為主席，我認為應該依照過往嘅慣例去處理議員提出嘅議決議案。

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:47,790
需要嘅作出修訂嘅建議咧，就徵詢內務委員會嘅同意，然後第三步咧就係經主席批准之後咧，再交畀立法會上審議嘅。

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:09,570
所以我係根據議事規則第七十四括弧一條，將有關嘅議決議案交付議事規則委員會去研究等。

14
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:43,020
立法會嘅議程去供委員審議。主席，其實你都話咧，即係慣例啦。咁其實議員都有即係可以提出佢哋嘅修正案，同埋點解唔可以喺即係誒喺誒立法會大嗰度即係畀佢哋傾咧？反正到最後都要投票㗎嘛，係咪？因為咧，即民主派打咗建制派佔佔咧，所以先唔畀佢哋提出。啊，我諗即係一個。

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:02:03,030
慣例咧，對依個支持體大嘅事件咧，係應該去遵守啊。以往嘅做法咧，我覺得係比較穩妥。係都話支持體大，點解唔可以畀佢哋喺大會度辯論咧？即係兩方都可以喺入邊討論㗎嘛。我諗即係支持體大，所以我哋又咪要經過依個三部曲，咁先穩妥咯。

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:23,040
Can you explain the rationale behind your decision to not allow the Democrats' proposals, amendments, rules, amendments to go through and be discussed in the council? Okay, I'll read my statement in English for you. Ten members have given notice to move at the council meeting of.

17
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
and the law of Hong Kong.

18
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,770
The reply has been copied to all members.

19
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,220
As the president, I should observe this.

20
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,760
我 have therefore referred the proposed resolution to crop.

21
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,030
喺你喺修改《二戰規則》呢件事上咧，建制派或者中聯辦冇畀個壓力咧，佢哋真係可以。

22
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,900
我剛剛發出回覆給那些成員關於擬議決議案。

23
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,870
by taking into account all the relevant factors, including the views of prop and the House Committee.

24
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:53,270
三部曲係比較穩妥。

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,280
on 15 November， a considerable number of proposed resolution to amend the rules of procedures.

26
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:02,940
and then by the house committee before being considered by the council, the three-step process need to be followed.

27
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:54,110
在我的回覆中，我指出，這是一個長期確立的慣例，即任何擬議的修訂程序規則，都應首先由歐盟審議。

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:32,810
In accordance with rules 74, bracket one of rules of procedures. After crop and house committee have completed their considerations of those proposed resolutions, then I will decide on whether those proposed resolutions amissible.

29
00:03:45,310 --> 00:04:05,320
我所有嘅誒決定咧，都係自己做嘅。啊，我當然係有我嘅誒秘書處嘅同事咧去睇過曬啦。啊，亦都有法律顧問同埋審議過以往點樣去做，去做呢個決定。

30
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:25,330
我聞講過咧，就話即係議事規則冇禁止啲議員可以直接將嗰啲收件提交嘅噉樣。呢個講法，你覺得係誒錯？任何議員咧都有個提案權嘅，但係作為主席咧係要審議過啊，然後至決定係咪接納。

31
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:45,340
啊！佢嘅做法，因為誒，尤其是依個議事規則裏邊去修改咧，係涉及基本法第七十五條裏邊要改嘅，咁所以其實係要有啲誒委員會去睇睇，依個係咪合憲合法，至可以去做嘅。咁所以我覺得係一個。

32
00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:13,560
Cam is going to will complain that they have the right to to file their amendments. If you are just refusing their right to, I think you know let's put it that way. They have the rights to file the amendments, but the amendments got to be in accordance to the basic law.

33
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,310
啊！今日法律會咪有睇啦～

34
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
穩妥啲嘅，好嘛？O K。

35
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,010
The I need as president, I need to follow.

36
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,510
誒，議事規則嘅第七十四括弧一咧，就話明。

37
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:23,080
And because this is important amendments to the rules of procedure, it is you know.

38
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:16,060
嚇！咁誒，但係因為依件嘢咧，係誒涉及係好多。

39
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:38,890
The prospectors to go through the three-step process。楊生可唔可以講清楚，即係其實如果民主派唔經過議事規則委員會直接交上嚟，係咪有違反到議事規則？

40
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:53,110
會去做嘅。誒，我覺得會比較好。

41
00:05:44,790 --> 00:06:04,800
啊，講明咧要修改議事規則咧，就依個議事規則委員會啊去審議嘅。咁所以即係啊，你可以睇翻第七十四條會比較清楚啲嘅。咁咪即係有混翻㗎嘛？啊，我覺得如果佢經過依個三個三部曲咧啊，然後去做咧係啊。

42
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:36,500
是唔同嘅啊！議事規則，亦都係我哋要睇睇有冇違翻個憲法，亦都違翻本地法律咁住去做。噉我哋既然有一個啊議事規則委員會喺度，係穩妥啲，係畀佢哋去審議，然後經過呢個三部曲咧，自擺上去立法。
