1
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,170
你。

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

3
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,270
quoted from proposed increase of criminal legal aid fees. That is a legal paper.

4
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,480
affect the quality of legal representation for the accused persons whose liberty is at stake. and of course.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,730
作出一個合理嘅辯護或者求情咧，噉啊，再次多謝主席，本人謹此陳詞。楊嶽橋議員。

6
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,120
The problem of delayed access to justice in Hong Kong is again brought to the surface and should be dealt with in due course.

7
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:36,110
more importantly, duty lawyer duty lawyer fees have not been seen an increase since 1997, other than CPI adjustments.

8
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:18,860
May I first declare that I am a practising lawyer, and in occasions I do represent clients and advise and act on criminal issues.

9
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:57,620
current government legal aid funding is directed only at representation. There is indeed limited assistance for an individual to obtain early legal advice, which will be explained further in due course.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:27,280
yet lawmakers, the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Bar Association of Hong Kong, have stated that such increase is still inadequate to encourage petitioners to take on pro bono work further without having a crippling effect on business.

11
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:35,130
主席， former British Prime Minister William Gladstone's famous phrase of "justice delayed is justice denied" seems to offer a perfect illustration of the problem of inadequate legal advice and assistance to citizens of Hong Kong.

12
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:48,410
The restrictions on recovering costs have indeed discouraged petitioners from litigating pro bono. As mentioned earlier, the government have finally agreed to consider a comprehensive review for an increase in fees payable to counsel and solicitors on criminal litigation work on behalf of the legal aid department.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:12,120
finally, a great to consider a comprehensive review of an increase in criminal legal aid fees in 2016 after long periods of lobbying, with an increase in fees by 50% for counsel and 25% for instructing instructing solicitors.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:55,420
在Chief Executive's 2017 policy address， the following commitment was repeated： enhancing access to legal aid and free legal advice to benefit more people who cannot afford free legal fees. To better reflect the increase in the charging fees for lawyers in the past 20 years， the government have

15
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,920
Powerful and ruthless weapons ever created.

16
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,500
例如， losing employment due to discrimination against disability or race.

17
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,940
the the fees for duty lawyers are way too low when compared to their legal aid counterparts.

18
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:06,470
一報告conducted by the Global Network for Public Interest Law identifies shortcomings of the law duty lawyer scheme.

19
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:37,980
as a matter of fact, Mr. President, individuals face issues on a daily life basis that could potentially benefit from timely and quality legal assistance.

20
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:27,290
Indeed, the legal aid policy objective is to quote to ensure that no one with reasonable grounds for pursuing or defending a legal action is denied access to justice because of a lack of means.

21
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:38,990
version of the law. According to the 2008 DOJ study, number one, 79% of household and 65% of SME respondents considered most people did not know what to do when faced with a legal problem.

22
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:14,050
香港，Indeed，with the support of legal aid since the late 1960s，and with the implementation of various other schemes，such as the duty lawyer scheme and the free legal advice scheme，the right to access to justice has been protected since the late 1970s.

23
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:27,120
另一方面，，after the completion of the 2016 review， the duty lawyer fees remains to be adjusted administratively to reflect the 4% change in CPI。 In other words， the fees for duty lawyers have not seen an increase since 1997， excluding CPI adjustments。

24
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:11,080
applying the same rationale behind the call for increasing criminal legal fees, the low fees provided under the duty lawyer scheme attracts junior and/or less experienced criminal lawyers. Lower costs came in the expense of relatively inexperienced and incompetent legal service provided.

25
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:57,470
Number two, while as a profession, Hong Kong's barristers, out of which 55%, 52%, and solicitors 37% of which, have provided pro bono services, by comparison to counterparts in England and Wales and Australia, they are reported to do less. End of quote.

26
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:24,780
the difference between the hourly rates payable to civil lawyers and those payable to criminal lawyers in private practice undertaking legal aid work, the legal profession is concerned that the criminal law field will lose its competitive edge to its civil law counterparts in attracting legal talents and retaining experienced practitioners, which may in turn

27
00:02:48,690 --> 00:03:08,700
This has come in response to the prolonged lobbying for an increase in criminal legal aid fees to make sure assigned solicitors and counsel in private practice are properly remunerated, and to take into consideration the fact that the legal aid fees payable to counsel and advocates were not substantively increased in the two thousand and twelve review.

28
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:53,330
Duty lawyers are normally paid for Hong Kong dollars three thousand four hundred and ninety for a half day, and seven thousand twenty for a full day. Each volunteer lawyer who attends legal service section under the free legal free legal advice service receives a travel allowance of merely three hundred Hong Kong dollars.

29
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:33,360
equal access to justice is said to be one of the most fundamental cornerstones of a civilised society. Indeed, back in 1919, American lawyer Ragnall Herbert Smith wanted that quote: without equal access to the law, the system not only robs the poor of their only protection, but it places in the hands of their oppressors the most

30
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:57,710
The right of access to justice is a right that safeguards other rights and ensuring equality of access to fundamental is fundamental to the system of the rule of law in Hong Kong. The government of Hong Kong has long upheld the value of access to justice. Article thirty five of the Basic Law reflects its importance as one of the fundamental rights for citizens.

31
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,650
legal advice scheme.

32
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,290
minute interview.

33
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,620
for duty lawyers to meet with a client.

34
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,660
subsequently，the effect。

35
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,360
of a delayed judgement may render effective execution or enforcement impossible.

36
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,810
一 defendant can expect to be represented by a different duty lawyer at each interim hearing.

37
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,000
這essentially amounts to a barrier to access to justice, especially if the client is vulnerable.

38
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:43,740
And only a handful of public interest lawyers are available in Hong Kong. The difficulty to approach pro bono lawyers with the right expertise on shop notices.

39
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:24,400
Delay could lead to destruction of evidence and fading of memories. Unnecessary delay could cause justice to be delivered too late to benefit the claimants.

40
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:44,540
Mr. President, in comparison, legal service models in different common law jurisdictions are making every effort focusing on early legal assistance and continuity in legal service.

41
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:24,860
more often, only a short period of time is available between lawyer and client, and with no follow up, the session might be wasted if the advice is not properly explained, it, which the client will likely not act accordingly.

42
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:38,360
Besides, although the free legal free legal advice scheme is free of charge, free legal advice will be refused if the issue presented involves complicated legal issues requiring detailed studying of documents.

43
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:13,910
quoting from Bentham, delayed not only tended to reduce, if not altogether eliminate, the practical value of a judgment, but it also reduced the likelihood that the judge would reach the right decision.

44
00:05:43,790 --> 00:06:03,800
橋約、合同和 sales and purchase agreements are some typical examples. Early legal advice not only can play a crucial role to help prevent the escalation of legal problems, but also potentially reduce the subsequent costs in other social economic policy areas, in welfare, healthcare and housing, for example.

45
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:24,550
Yet, in addition to a legal system that is too costly for the community to access, inadequate early legal advice and assistance is also one of the major problems faced by the general public in Hong Kong. Barrister and human rights consultant So Chum described the phenomenon essentially as a Rolls Royce.

46
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:26,760
This includes the scheme being reactive, where a solicitor or barrister is assigned to only one hearing and there's no follow-through between court appearances. Inadequate legal advice and consultation before representation is occasionally with only fifteen minutes available before a court hearing on the day of the plea.

47
00:07:44,600 --> 00:08:04,610
What's more, the free legal advice scheme is one-off legal advice section with no follow-up. Even in the rare cases where there is follow-up, the time lag and the fact that a client has to speak to a new lawyer each time after the first appearance will no doubt affect the quality of the legal assistance provided under the free.

48
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,260
In fact, the Hong Kong government should be aware of the need for early legal assistance and advice.

49
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,590
what about Hong Kong, Mr. President? Well, we are now still debating whether we should further increase the fees for lawyers.

50
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:39,870
1986，The Working Party on Legal Aid examined the option of using Green Form Scheme in England and Wales.

51
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:53,760
especially in the assistance for small not-for-profit organisation in supporting their service continuation and expansion.

52
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:35,890
一網絡的NGOs會會 be able to refer clients to this proposed community legal service centre.

53
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:32,060
There have been proposal by various consultation bodies or even legislators over the past thirty years for measures that could potentially address the issues.

54
00:12:49,370 --> 00:13:00,510
Coming to the end, Mr. President, the saying "justice delayed is justice denied" seems to offer a perfect illustration of the problem of inadequate legal advice and assistance to citizens of Hong Kong.

55
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:44,850
在英國，LawWorks作為慈善組織，致力於 enable access to justice to individuals who are in need of legal services but without means to pay for a lawyer.

56
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:48,210
operate interview centres or walk-in specialist clinics and co-organise outreach programmes for legal education and training with duty law scheme. This was, however, Mr President, not adopted.

57
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:53,090
The scheme would enable an individual with limited means to consult a solicitor for two hours to get initial general advice about their legal situation and the options available, and or to write letters.

58
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:58,080
Take Australia for example, a large network of Australian government-funded community legal centres, together with unique models of community legal services, are being offered in each state and territory.

59
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:33,090
And to provide criminal legal aid services, the Law Society Pro Bono Service Limited of Singapore work in collaboration with NGOs, because they recognise the fact that NGOs are often better equipped to understand the needs of the community.

60
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:08,520
The service often involves 30 to 45 minutes of initial legal advice and the identification of the client's options and next steps, with the possibility of providing further assistance like writing a letter or filing a forms.

61
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:07,500
1993，the same working party received no response after recommending the legal profession to allow qualified lawyers to work for voluntary agencies and to provide free legal advisory services on a full-time basis.

62
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:26,490
and in two thousand and two came the proposal from Margaret and Audrey Yu, both former legislator and civic party legislators. In order to meet the need for proper, timely, free and affordable legal advice, they recommended a community legal service centre. It was suggested.

63
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:59,220
There's indeed a significant gap in provision of free and early legal advices, legal services in Hong Kong. Limited assistance is available for an individual to obtain early legal advice. The current waiting time can be up to eight weeks for a free legal advice scheme, where an individual is only entitled to a thirty.

64
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:19,160
在新加坡，律政會新加坡研究關於提供法律援助的2006年，提出兩項建議，關於提供公辦援助。第一，設立25小時的公辦援助律師每年。第二，設立公辦服務辦公室，尋找新項目。

65
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,800
啲咧。

66
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,290
郭榮亨議員。

67
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,740
Mr. President, I rest my case.

68
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,480
This bill, of course, we will have full support.

69
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:08,150
There are plenty of people in Hong Kong who might have, you know, some income, some

70
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:11,770
性，亦都唔需要多講咧。就係其實香港嘅發緩制度咧，已經係啊全球裏邊其中一個最好嘅地方，但係咧啊。

71
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:36,570
但另一方面，我 wish the secretary will understand that this is simply the first step of a long, long way of of reform and also access to justice.

72
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:59,220
Mr. President, knowing that the secretary is also present today, I also wish to make a very clear and sincere message to the secretary that.

73
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:12,580
An essential part aspect of the rule of law is that citizens should be able to vindicate their rights and to have their claims determined by independent judges in accordance with the law.

74
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:44,350
發緩嗰個狀態係比較好，咁但係好可惜啦。刑事發緩呢一方面咧，就係我哋法律界同埋好多社會人士不斷去追求啊改善嘅一個好重要嘅環節。

75
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:25,250
If justice is delayed excessively, not only would the ability of litigants to use the legal system efficiently be impaired, but also a denial of justice altogether in extreme cases.

76
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:22,200
amount in their bank accounts, but they simply cannot afford a lawyer. Lawyers are way too expensive in Hong Kong, and we should really reconsider and have a an adequate review of the system as a whole.

77
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:45,870
Ensuring the legal system delivers timely justice for all calls upon the government of Hong Kong to fulfil its constitutional duty of resolving disputes in accordance with the law. The fees for duty law service should be increased accordingly without hesitation. Individual access to justice should be further protected and guaranteed without.

78
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,130
啊，一直係嗯。

79
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,120
佢自己嘅喺法律上嘅權利啦。

80
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:34,720
我可唔可以即時有一個嗯刑事法援嘅律師嚟到去畀法律意見呢？好多時差人同佢講話，你可以打電話畀自己律師。

81
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:45,730
但係，當嗰個人冇錢，或者根本上完全未遇過呢啲事，亦都唔識得任何律師嘅時候，噉佢係點樣去彰顯？

82
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:24,320
而刑事法援嗰個覆蓋面又足唔足夠咧？好多人都講話，譬如當你係啊畀啊呢一個警務人員拉咗翻去警處嘅時候。

83
00:19:49,730 --> 00:20:02,160
警察同佢講話，你可以打電話畀你嘅律師，呢個只係淪為空談，因為咧好多時喺差管嘅時候落緊口供嘅時候，根本上就冇律師去畀法律意見佢，好多時咧。

84
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:55,510
條例草案佢裏邊所啊提嘅一啲費用咧，其實你見到啊好多時嗰個每小時收費啊等等咧，其實都係同啊私人執業一般私人執業嗰個收費咧係有好大段距離。

85
00:16:44,660 --> 00:17:00,920
做啊，都無能為力，做唔到，因為點解咧？做接一單發還嘅案件，好多時係倒蝕嘅。點解咧？譬如好簡單，當你要去探一個誒犯人喺誒監獄嗰度去誒攞指示。

86
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:12,230
咁刑事法援，當咁重要嘅時候，點解刑事法援會係比呢一個民事法援少咁多資源咧？呢個我希望係局方咧喺回應嘅時候可以解答一下，因為正如我頭先所講，刑事法援咧對於市民嚟講咧係更加重要。

87
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:40,280
個收費啊嘅標準咁咧，亦都係跟翻啊，只係呢一個啊升咗四個percent。咁大家睇到就係根本上，當你嗰個基數係咁低嘅時候咧啊，如果你睇翻一啲數據啦，即係今次呢一個啊。

88
00:14:42,100 --> 00:15:02,110
多謝主席。主席頭先咧，好多同事咧都講咗好多誒，好高同埋好遠大嘅一啲原則啊，關於法治，關於法援咁咧，我就唔需要再重複去講嗰啲説話，因為嗰啲説話咧其實啊，大家都識啊去講，大家都明白法援嘅重要。

89
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:32,060
民事法援同刑事法援咧，必須要分開，因為民事法援咧確實嘅質素咧係高，而近年嚟咧局方亦都咧係擴大咗呢個民事法援嘅好多嘅誒資源啦，同埋咧係唔同類型嘅案件咧都已經係啊包含咗喺呢個民事法援嗰度。咁所以民民事法

90
00:15:44,630 --> 00:16:04,640
而啊，刑事法援咧，其實往往嚟講咧，係比呢一個民事法援咧係誒更加誒重要嘅，因為點解咧？當然就係刑事法援係關於一個人嘅自由，一個人嘅誒誒，佢可能一生最重要嘅一個誒面對嘅挑戰。

91
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:24,650
就係畀人啊控告，畀政府控告啊一個刑事嘅罪行噉，所以刑事法援咧係對於啊市民嚟講咧係啊更加重要噉。但係好可惜，我哋法律界見到咧咁多年嚟咧刑事法援所得到嘅支援咧係遠遠不足。誒幾年前。

92
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:44,660
誒，我哋見到刑事法援嗰個嘅誒仲費定額咧，係有大幅嘅提升，因為過去咧，無論係律師又好，大律師又好咧，嗰個刑事法援嗰個誒定額收費咧，都係非常非常之低，低到咧有好多法律界嘅同行同我講，佢話佢哋就算有心想去。

93
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:21,340
竟然咧做律師嘅誒，同埋個大狀一齊去咧，就可以誒向法院申請攞翻錢。但係如果係嗰個律師行嘅自己嘅人員去咧，冇大律師陪同咧，就冇得收翻錢喎。即係竟然係有啲咁荒謬嘅地方。咁呢個其實我哋都～

94
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:43,480
希望局局方去改善咁喺呢一方面，亦都係有改善噉。但係咧，啊呢啲噉樣嘅情況咧，仍然都係啊有發生，就係咧嗰個律師或者大狀咧，佢哋去做呢一啲刑事發緩嘅案件咧，係得不償失喺錢銀方面。咁所以即係呢一個令人咧好多啊律。

95
00:17:43,480 --> 00:18:03,490
啲啊，尤其是係誒自己本身都夠嘢做嘅，自己本身質素非常之好嘅，誒大大律師同律師啦，都誒係見到刑事法援咧，都係有點而卻步，就係噉嘅原因。但係其實好多人咧都好願意係誒，就算幾忙都好啦，都係會做法援嘅案件，因為咧。

96
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:09,520
事務委員會將會去討論關注嘅一個事項，噉我希望咧，啊局長咧，亦都係可以就住呢一點咧，係去回應。

97
00:23:50,230 --> 00:24:00,180
去做一個一套嘅刑事法援服務，啊專業服務計劃係可以包含曬而家所有嘅。

98
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:33,020
係佢有冇講錯説話，或者有冇得到律師嘅一個誒，畀佢嘅一個誒意見咧？呢一個係好重要嘅一個環節嚟。

99
00:21:47,420 --> 00:22:00,120
係唔知道點樣去揾律師，亦都冇錢去揾律師。咁呢啲情況就係啦。如果嗰個學生佢喺誒落口供嗰時唔小心講錯説話，或者係講咗一啲誒誒錯嘅嘅資訊。

100
00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:07,120
畀呢一個發還佢，畀一個啊啊呢個法律諮詢嘅服務咧，畀依位律啊人士。噉我哋嗰個成個發還嘅服務咧，尤其是刑事嗰方面咧，先至係算係整全。

101
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:23,500
做法援嘅案件，除咗係提供一個專業服務之外咧，仍然大部分嘅誒法律界咧都係相信呢個係對社會嘅一個好重要嘅服務。咁但係好可惜就係刑事法援咧，而家只不過係誒隨着呢一個即係每兩年一檢嘅一個誒提供佢嗰。

102
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:22,490
你問一啲做刑事嘅案件嘅律師同大狀，或者好似楊嶽橋議員噉樣，佢都可以話畀你聽。其實落口供呢一個環節係非常之重要。好多時一單案件究竟打甩甩同打唔甩，嗰個分別咧就係在於喺呢個警處嘅時候落嗰份口供紙，究竟咧。

103
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:53,310
咁所以其實啊，刑事法援我哋不嬲都係同呢一個處方講咧，就係一定要擴展到警處，或者擴展到當有執法人員拘捕咗一個人嘅時候，佢係可以即時打電話畀一啲啊啊在職嘅律師，當職嘅律師係去畀。

104
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:27,410
咁誒，大家知道，譬如嗰陣時誒誒雨傘運動嘅時候，有好多大規模嘅手部行動，好多人畀人拉咗。咁結果係點樣咧？就係好多律師咧、法律界嘅同業啦，都係自願噉樣，二十四小時七天都係按call，就係咧隨時如果。

105
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:47,420
有啊，學生或者有其他示威人士被捕，佢哋都會馬上跑到落去呢一個警署又好，拘留所又好啦，係免費將一啲啊嘅法律服務咧，係畀呢啲被拘捕嘅示威人士。因為呢啲示威人士咧，好多都係學生噉。學生，老實説，佢哋梗。

106
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:20,410
記錄咗落嚟嘅時候，呢個將會變成正功，可能會影響佢一生。咁所以呢一個誒誒刑事法援咧，對於誒而家嗰個覆蓋面咧，係確實係不足夠，亦都係咧，我希望處方咧係會馬上檢討。咁講開，當值律師咧，啊不能夠唔。

107
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,720
法援處嘅律師同埋公務員咧，都係非常之專業。

108
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,800
咁呢個咧係大大影響住香港嗰個司法制度嘅有效性同埋誒。

109
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:22,620
話咧，佢要花嘅時間係比起其他案件咧多三成嘅。

110
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,900
一個大家千祈唔好輕視啊！呢一個啊法援處嗰個嘅中立性同埋專業性。

111
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:28,600
法援處嘅重要性，當然就係佢去審批呢一個刑事法援同埋民事法援嘅申請啦。咁首先我要講嘅就係。

112
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:47,380
其實佢哋扮演嘅角色係非常之重要。如果你亂噉話佢有人濫用呢個法援，濫用誒誒誒誒隨便去批呢個法援嘅話咧，呢一個係對制度本身係唔認識。

113
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:11,860
成日都會有啲人去批評法援，就話你批得太多法援啊，誒，畀人濫用法援啊。其實呢啲説話咧，對於第一法援處嚟講咧，係非常之唔公道，因為法援處嘅同事，正如我頭先所講，每一位都係非常之專業。

114
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:31,520
按照法律去批呢一個發還嘅工作，咁所以咧，我希望大家咧批評還批評，唔好去啊貶低或者係惡意批評發還處裏邊一啲緊守崗位、專業嘅律師同埋啊公務員。

115
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:40,420
講嘅就係當值律師服務咧，亦都係啊非常之啊十幾年咧，係冇檢討過。咁如果大家有留意開呢一個司法事務委員會嘅討論啦，啊，我作為副主席同埋好多成員咧，大家都好關心。除咗刑事法援嘅覆蓋面之外啦，嚟緊我哋亦都會有一個檢討係。

116
00:22:40,420 --> 00:23:00,430
檢討呢個當值律師服務，因為當值律師服務咧，亦都係可以啊延伸到去警處啦，亦都係咧嗰個誒所被提供嘅資源咧，係遠遠不足去支援而家當值律師服務所需要嘅一啲資源同人手。咁呢一方面咧，當值律師服務亦都係我哋司法。

117
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:30,220
點解要講刑事法援？點解要講當值律律師服務嘅重要性咧？當然有好多人會講就係話，其實當值律師服務啊同埋刑事法援係咪有重疊啊？其實咧確實係有重疊，但係咧係唔需要係其實，如果當刑事法援係做得全面嘅。

118
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:50,230
嘅話，亦當刑事法援係可以擴大佢個覆蓋面嘅話，確實係我哋可能唔需要當值律師服務。點解要有當值律師服務咧？就係因為而家嘅刑事法援制度有漏洞。咁但係其實如果兩個制度如果一齊去檢討、一齊去睇嘅時候，我哋係咪可以將啲資源集中噉樣？

119
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:20,530
啊，刑事案件嘅需要咧，呢一個亦都係局方希望去檢討嘅。今今年嘅施政報告咧，我哋睇到就係啊，法援處咧係啊將會係啊轉交到去呢一個政務司司長嘅啊啊工作範疇底下。

120
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:40,540
咁呢一個咧，亦都係法援服務局咧多年嚟嘅一個建議。噉我哋法律界咧，亦都係嗯支持呢個建議。咁好高興見到今今年咧就可以落實呢一個啊建議，將呢一個法援處嘅工作啊交轉交到去政務司司。

121
00:24:40,540 --> 00:25:00,550
我希望噉樣咧，係會整個政府對於法援處嘅工作咧，係提升關注度啦，將佢嘅重要性咧提供，亦都係咧會更加受到關注，更加得到資源去啊充實佢嘅工作。噉我希望咧嚟緊咧，政務司司長會去考慮檢討。

122
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:20,560
除咗係刑事法援嘅收費之外啦，亦都會檢討整個法援嘅制度，包括民事法援啦。民事法援其實我哋已經講咗好多年，就係點樣去擴大佢嘅覆蓋面，同埋咧係點樣將呢一個誒法援處咧係誒嗰個服務咧係提升。

123
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:54,080
非常之謹慎噉樣去行使佢哋嘅公職，亦都係咧每一單案件我所知道嘅都係非常之專業獨立噉樣去處理每一個申請，按呢一個法援條例同埋有關法律咧係去批出呢個法援嘅。咁所以其實喺啊呢一個議事廳或者出。

124
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,150
If.

125
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,320
可持續性。

126
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,350
他或她不能被試fairly for that offence。

127
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,560
Now, of course, in 2015/16.

128
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,730
他或她應該不應該被審判，for it at all.

129
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:38,380
Now, under the present legal A system administered by the Home Affairs Department, there are three completely different types of legal A schemes.

130
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:26,400
Now, in fact, I mean, for a fair criminal trial to take place, not just should we have a independent impartial court, access to justice is very important.

131
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:56,850
The fee for the criminal legal aid has been increased, reflecting the rise in the legal fee, which has not been taken into account for for many years.

132
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:45,970
方會有一個整全係誒可以顧及多方面多方位嘅一個檢討，令到法援嘅工作咧喺未來發展得係更好，同埋咧係更多人受惠嘅。多謝主席。

133
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:44,810
在administring of our rules of law，因為，persons， individuals， accused， fate and destiny could possibly， be jeopardised if he or she doesn't have legal aid or a capable lawyer to defend his case。

134
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:13,300
However, for the past 20 odd years, the government have been neglecting the demand for the revise or increase in the fees payable to the duty lawyers, which is a totally completely different legal aid scheme.

135
00:30:45,720 --> 00:31:02,930
In fact, the right to a fair criminal trial has been described as the birthright of every citizen, and it has also been said to be emblematic that a person charged with having committed a criminal offence should receive a fair trial, and that.

136
00:29:50,010 --> 00:30:09,390
Mr President, I am speaking on the legal aid in criminal cases amendment rules, 2017. Indeed, I must declare my interest first. Mr President, I am a practising solicitor of the High Court, although I don't have any much chance of doing criminal cases as I myself is a practising tax lawyer.

137
00:26:47,660 --> 00:27:07,670
對於本身批發換嗰個嘅理據，亦都唔認識。其實如果你睇翻一啲誒數字嘅話咧，應試花換喺法庭打得甩，最後可以啊打贏嘅話咧，其實嗰個數字係唔低嘅。同樣呢一個民事法換亦都係嘅，好多案件咧係如果冇。

138
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:27,680
咗民事法援嘅話咧，其實本身第一嗰個人可能冇得告啦，或者咧係冇得去為自己辯護啦。呢一個咧係你睇翻個數字啦，有好多民事同埋刑事法援嘅案件咧，其實都係真係幫助到最後咧係能夠喺法庭度取得公義。咁所以呢一

139
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:55,920
最後咧，我想講就係發緩點解係咁重要咧？除咗係頭先我好多同事講嘅一啲好原則性嘅問題之外啦，其實發緩咧對於呢一個法庭嗰個嘅有效運作都係好重要。當啊一個人無論佢喺刑事案件做被告又好，或者喺一個民

140
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:15,930
民事訴訟裏邊做其中一方都好咧，當佢係冇律師代表嘅時候，法庭嘅工作就會非常非常之繁重。有法官誒做過一個客觀嘅研究，佢話：如果一單案件裏邊有一其中一方係冇法律誒律師代表嘅。

141
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:43,250
咁即係話咧，其實而家長期積壓咗喺法庭嘅一啲案件，或者同埋喺法庭嗰個輪候時間點解咁長咧？就係因為有好多案件咧，都係好可惜，就係其中一方咧係冇呢一個，或者雙方啊，甚至係一啲民事嘅案件咧，係冇律師代表。

142
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,980
No。

143
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,490
just record.

144
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,450
第一。

145
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,830
It's insufficient.

146
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,420
叫作第一instance。

147
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,370
Legal aid scheme， concernin about legal aid。

148
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,190
The top partners in the city firm is about.

149
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,060
Now, in terms of the two different legal aid schemes.

150
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,420
$12,000。$12,000。

151
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,670
會pay for the fees for.

152
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,450
刑事legal aid或The duty lawyer scheme，係 mediocre。

153
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,070
the court of appeal, the court of the court of final appeal and also committal proceedings in magistracies.

154
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:20,100
僕僕，

155
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:52,350
For a newly qualified lawyer in a very small firm, the average hourly would be ranging from $2,000 to $3,000.

156
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:10,860
A barrister or senior barrister would be charging up to fifteen thousand dollars, and it is very common. And it is not uncommon that a senior

157
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:11,610
如果發緩制度係能夠提升，可以將刑事發緩嘅誒誒質素提高，有更多律師咧係願意去做或或者接發緩嘅案件，呢一個咧係會令到整體香港嗰個司法制度嘅運作係對一個整全香港。

158
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:31,620
有誒嘅發展咧，都係一個好事。咁所以咧，呢一個發緩嘅制度，我哋絕對唔能夠輕視，亦都咧係希望局方咧就住呢一個刑事發緩咧，唔好只係靠每兩年一次檢討去增加嗰個嘅收費或者資源，呢一個係唔夠嘅。我希望局。

159
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:29,950
And in fact, I think in this chamber, rarely do we have a chance to have a very in-depth debate of our legal aid system, in particular, criminal legal aid. As my honourable friend Denis Cott has pointed out, legal aid in criminal cases is really important.

160
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:35,360
Let me tell you how the legal market works, my honourable president. In fact, if you can look at what the small firms, the medium-sized firms and the city firms and the barristers are charging these day, it is not difficult for us to see that the amount attributable or allocated to

161
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,810
however，Mr. President。

162
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
在 magistrate court level。

163
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,640
to help those victims.

164
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,320
excluding rent， as far as I can remember。

165
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,590
係一種嘅總體通脹指數。

166
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,110
and although I think in the present circumstances and pragmatically.

167
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,500
to the consumer price index， there is no linkage， direct or indirect。

168
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,620
of the fees to the consumer price index.

169
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:51,370
The charge rate, or how the salary level of lawyers.

170
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:18,750
In fact， there are three factors which will affect the chargeable rate， chargeable by solicitors.

171
00:34:52,090 --> 00:35:00,180
因為我係一個訴訟的 profession，我可以講 about lawyers， their charter rate and the salary trend are not really linked.

172
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:38,640
It would be quite difficult for our adjustments to be linked to the charter ray of solicitors working in this city. But however, I would just have to share this with you. There are three main factors. One.

173
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:19,370
now，however，when I look at how this rate adjustment mechanism works，I'm very puzzled because the rate here has been linked to a basket of consumer price index.

174
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:33,750
Category C. Now, although I'm quite aware, Mr. President, that this kind of mechanism has been used, the Category C consumer price index, which is a basket of commodities and goods.

175
00:33:45,750 --> 00:34:00,700
now，whereas，the，duty，lawyer，scheme，this，is，what，the，rule，is，talking，about，is，a，scheme，jointly，set，up，by，the，law，society，and，the，bar，association，is，a，kind，of，joint，venture，NGO。now，it，is，meant

176
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:58,930
是 overhead cost of the firm， which is basically I think the main cost of a firm will be the rental。 and secondly is the salary trend of solicitors， and is is inextricably driven by external economic factor， including the numbers of transactions and the

177
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,120
however。

178
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,170
to get two these two types of information.

179
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,380
And thirdly, it is the complexity of the transaction or the vice concerned.

180
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,830
And it does give you a very clear picture of what each categories of lawyers are charging.

181
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,950
And in fact, if we want to improve the quality of the duty lawyers, Mr. President.

182
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,940
你 may want to do it as a starting point, but it is unsatisfactory. In fact, when I talk to

183
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:22,320
now，honestly，I，cannot，see，how，the，legal，aid，department，or，our，legislature，here，could

184
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:31,320
try to link up the adjustment level with all these pay levels or the overhead level of legal practitioners.

185
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:34,070
Now, if we look at the general criminal legal aid system, apart from looking at the level of fees.

186
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:07,830
number of deals taking place in this jurisdiction and in the the neighbouring jurisdictions.

187
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:44,090
And I think the legal A department should think hard whether the linkage to the category C consumer price index should still continue. Although, as I have said,

188
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:24,810
This basket of consumer price index to be a reference point. Well, but indeed you can do that. Do that, but I think the trend of the charge of the lawyers should be looked at.

189
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:48,220
The access to justice is a very important component of our rule of law. Apart from having an impartial, independent, transparent system and impartial, independent judiciary.

190
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:26,560
You should really consider try to link up the biannual revision of the level of the duty lawyer fees with the trend of the criminal lawyers or the criminal barristers, and it is not difficult.

191
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:53,590
There are other reference points which I think you should take into account. For example, there is the annual pay trend conducted by major consultancy firms, headhunters, firms like PA Consultants, do have the legal market survey.

192
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,600
second.

193
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,550
to preserve the rule of law in this city.

194
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,230
目前是 not 覆蓋 by 法律援助。

195
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,320
first of all，the government legal aid funding。

196
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,300
merely focuses on representation.

197
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,690
是個process that requires legal analysis.

198
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,650
The access to legal service is the key.

199
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:26,230
and there is a limited assistance for individual to obtain early legal advice.

200
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,150
他或她會 need legal advice at that stage and merely like what Mr Dennis Kwok has just said.

201
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:55,720
common grassroots people, common citizens， would be difficult to get a lawyer of hand.

202
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:03,190
Now, if we look at the criminal legal aid system critically, it is quite

203
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:49,310
The police officer will just ask you, if you have a lawyer, you can call him. You can call your lawyer, but

204
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:25,580
legal aid only concerns or covers the proceeding stage and the application for legal aid itself.

205
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:12,390
quite easy to identify a few gaps, which I think the Home Affairs Department should be paying much more attention to address these gaps.

206
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:35,870
what does that mean when a person is being apprehended by a police officer and he is being detained in a police station?

207
00:37:51,340 --> 00:38:11,350
Departments like the water supplies department, they are reviewing the the the the water supply from Donggong. Really, they are just making reference to the consumer price index basket as well. So it is quite ridiculous because every department seems to be you know using.

208
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:16,010
let alone to to get a lawyer to deal with the relevant situation at the police station. There's nothing, nothing at all, which the present legal aid system could assist any person who has been detained in the police station or other law enforcement agencies.

209
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,410
should。

210
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,130
The legal aid.

211
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,770
Interview by a lawyer is not adequate.

212
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,550
The director of public prosecution is laying a charge on you.

213
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,390
Often the client will only have about no fifteen minutes.

214
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,080
Thirdly, in criminal cases, most defendants only get access to a lawyer.

215
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:50,010
或 in criminal case of course there is not much of a choice if you are being charged by the government.

216
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:41,520
which means here, this is what the rules talk about duty lawyers in the magistrate court before the first hearing.

217
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:42,220
先生，我講緊關於申請程序 for legal aid， which is also important， 因為， one has to decide whether to proceed.

218
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:34,260
所以我會 like to urge that the Home Affairs Bureau should look into whether the duty lawyer service.

219
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:46,250
作為一個方案，extend to people you know who has been detained in the police station and charges are being laid on them.

220
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:52,380
the first hearing, Mr. President, and not during the police interview process, where the statement of the defendant is being taken by the police.

221
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:24,430
And the duty lawyer will have no use at all during this interview process, unless of course the defendant's own lawyer attending the police station for him.

222
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:26,960
所以，做呢個分析喺呢個初步階段，Whether or not you should get for get a legal A or whether you are qualified for legal A is important.

223
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:09,840
去 discuss the cases with the lawyer in the police station, and this is quite insufficient. And in a situation where one is detained by a police officer in a police station, a mere fifteen twenty minutes.

224
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:13,850
There is perhaps very limited choice in you know putting up defence. In many, in ninety percent of the cases, I believe you have no choice but do you do have to put up your defence. Either you do your defence by yourself, or if you have enough financial resources, you get a very reputable criminal lawyer. or

225
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,500
你。

226
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,260
and then。

227
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,700
係一個一 off。

228
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,690
多謝議員，要求點算法定人數？

229
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,770
30分鐘，一節。

230
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,560
其他亞洲司法管轄區在於法的原則。

231
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,680
with average eight week waiting time, and this is highly unsatisfactory.

232
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,590
Mr. President, if we want to overhaul and review the legal aid system, I think it is better.

233
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:51,370
And Hong Kong always have a very high rating in terms of our rule of law in this city.

234
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:25,310
to review these three schemes together and not just making piecemeal adjustments every year or every two years.

235
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:43,940
你 all know， if a charge is being laid on a citizen by a government， the consequence can be dire and serious。

236
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:58,720
An ancillary scheme called the free legal advice scheme, which is in addition to the legal aid system and also the duty lawyer system.

237
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:34,830
Now of course I'm talking about the criminal legal system here, and I don't want to digress into the civil area because as

238
00:43:51,650 --> 00:44:03,080
And in fact, in our in the most recent survey, we come up as amongst the top 20 jurisdictions in the world, and we are leading.

239
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:23,630
And I think in our chief executive's policy speech, she has stressed that one of our core values, one of the core values of this city, is our rule of law and the judiciary judicial independence.

240
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:44,070
這些係兩條支柱，以確保一個無辜的人應該保持無辜，他或她會得到最好的法律顧問、最好的法律代表。但沒有法律援助，我們無法提供這些幫助給這些人。謝謝，主席。

241
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,150
誒。

242
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,530
多謝梁月。

243
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,960
開始風險。

244
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,030
咁喺呢個。

245
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,540
咁其實我哋。

246
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,330
我發現咧，都係。

247
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,190
咁今次咧呢個決議案。

248
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,000
期咁希望你就可以盡快實施嘅。

249
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,530
刑事法律援助費用呢個兩年一度嘅檢討裏邊咧？

250
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:37,150
或者通縮，即係我諗係喺市民大眾聽來都係非常之合理。咁聘用大律師同埋律師嘅時候，係咪出現困難咧？我覺得呢一點咧。

251
00:59:52,060 --> 01:00:05,960
可以誒睇得到，當中佢有提過一一點嘅，就話佢哋檢討嗰陣有啲咩嘢嘅係準則咧，考慮咗啲咩嘅因素咧？佢係咁講嘅就。

252
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:34,880
支持今次嘅係刑事訴訟程序條例動議嘅決議案，亦都希望咧就誒呢個決議案係可以通過咧，跟住就盡快咧提交生效日期公告，就指明新修訂嘅刑事法援嘅費用嘅實施日。

253
00:58:41,510 --> 00:59:01,520
誒同埋呢個嘅刑事嘅法援嘅費用嘅加幅咧，即係都係嚟自係刑事法律援助費用、檢控費用同埋當值律師費用兩年一度嘅檢討。咁呢個檢討裏邊咧，就即係有個好詳細嘅誒分析同埋報告啦。咁當然最後個

254
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:21,530
結論就係將現時法律嘅發還費用調高四個percent。咁其實咧，誒，即係即係報告所指都係檢討所指啦，都係反映翻一四年七月至到一六年七月呢個嘅丙類消費物價指數嘅累計變動。咁頭先有議員發言都講過啦，即係誒。

255
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:41,540
誒，其實有其他方法，或者亦都有議員講過話，即係呢個加幅個幅度究竟係應該四個percent啦，計丙類啊，計甲類啊，應唔應該超過即係呢個指數嘅變動等等啦。噉我喺嗰度咧就唔重複嗰啲觀點，但我認為嗰啲觀點咧都係即係政府應該考慮嘅。

256
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:26,250
誒喺喺個檢討裏邊，佢話根據立法會即係財務委員會喺一九九二年呢個咁古老嘅即係決定啦，噉就每兩年檢討一次。咁咧主要考慮就係通脹或者通縮呢啲情況。咁同埋咧聘用大律師時候咧係咪出現困難嗱？如果用通脹。

257
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,890
咁所以刑事。

258
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,430
用呢個定義就話冇困難咧。

259
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,990
都係牙耳氣。頭先我都聽到有沿用呢個字，牙耳氣。

260
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:41,070
自由嘅一啲嘅問題，但係講刑事嘅時候。

261
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:16,030
誒民事同埋刑事嘅法援當中嘅分別。

262
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:11,050
嗱喺誒頭先誒有有部分嘅議員發言都提到咧。

263
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:25,450
原來民事同埋刑事嘅法援嗰個係費用個水平。

264
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:43,430
係要好好放大同埋好仔細咁去睇，乜嘢先叫出現困難？

265
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:55,650
好多誒係做刑事法援嘅律師同埋大律師咧。

266
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:07,180
喂，刑事嘅罰緩價去做啦，好唔好啊？即係攞攞嚟畀人係自嘲同埋講笑。

267
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:48,720
咁點解咧？嗱，再諗再睇深一層，呢個就係可能就係即係檢討個機制裏面話係咪出現困難啦？原來個困難就係。

268
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:39,420
本身係一個已經有一個差距，所裏邊牽涉參與喺裏邊係執業嘅律師，佢嘅年資同埋佢嘅質素同埋佢嘅經驗，都係一大橛嘅差距嚟嘅。

269
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:19,630
嘅發緩係咪值得我哋更加係睇重啲社會嘅，把更加多嘅資源落去咧？咁但係似乎現實嘅環境話畀我哋聽，刑事嘅發緩社會好似係睇輕啲嘅，因為頭先即係議員都講到啦。

270
01:00:43,750 --> 01:01:03,760
如果你好簡單，即係喺字面上咁解釋，我請到人，有人肯做，排住隊去做，咁又喺個行業裏邊係運作良好、操作正常，就叫冇困難咧。話嘅話咧，我覺得今次政府應該喺今次咁深刻嘅討論、咁多議員發言裏邊咧，諗深一層，係咪？

271
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:36,420
噉我都要再強調一次啊，即係主席希望你唔好話我係重複，因為呢點係非常之重要。就係喺民事嘅案件，我哋好好多時都係講緊即係金錢嘅損失、前債嘅考慮、賠償同埋咧，即係一啲唔牽涉即係個人。

272
01:01:41,350 --> 01:02:01,360
我哋好重要，好強調一點係講緊人身嘅自由咧，係可以受到剝奪嘅。如果一個刑事案件處理得唔好，如果係係含冤待雪等等，係可以毀咗一個人嘅一生，而且係呢個都係牽涉咧係個人自由同埋基本人權嘅問題嚟嘅。

273
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:10,030
噉，但係。

274
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,690
即係點解？

275
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,590
咁所以我哋係啊！

276
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,200
因為佢都係工人嚟㗎啦。

277
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:01,040
有人話，即係即係講得俗啲，做到咁cheap。

278
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,080
我哋講緊誒刑事被起訴嘅人。

279
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:40,060
係唔係窮嘅人？我畀人刑事起訴嘅時候。

280
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:55,530
係咪畀人即係睇低一線？社會係睇輕，唔係睇重咧？

281
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:46,540
我哋社會覺得唔係好緊要啦，畀啲渣渣啲嘅律師或冇經驗嘅佢都O K啦。

282
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:08,180
都有人做，正正就係有呢一班係有公義、有正義之心嘅律師，肯去做。

283
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:24,120
可能講尤尤其是講緊發緩嘅背景底下咧，嗰啲係相對係誒經濟誒需要援助冇咁富裕嘅人。

284
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:34,600
我哋再去一個左膠啲嘅理理論去睇下啦，係咪窮嘅人畀人刑事檢控嘅時候就更加唔值得幫咧？

285
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:20,900
有啲律師可以噉係，你話敬業熬夜又好，鞠躬盡瘁都好。即使喺呢個遇到咁低嘅薪酬水平。

286
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:35,110
講緊即係對對一般市民大眾嚟講，可能好高啦，即係時薪一千至兩千幾蚊之間。但係對於即係法律行業嘅整體嘅水平嚟講咧，係低嘅，呢個係客觀事實，亦都係毋庸置疑。

287
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:55,410
點解有一班即係主要係後生啲嗰班即係律師同大律師都肯做咧？正正就係講得出我哋講話刑事嘅發緩嘅影響嘅深遠，同埋講緊係社會嘅公義得唔得到彰顯，同埋都係講緊每一個人嘅個人嘅自由係咪得到保障？

288
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:17,510
更加覺得更加要留意嘅，就係近年有好多嘅係政治檢控嘅個案，即係各位建制派議員同意唔同意都好啦。現實上、客觀上就係多咗一啲喺示威遊行同埋一啲喺政治嘅衝突嘅案件裏。

289
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,000
邊？

290
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,860
窮人。

291
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,550
畀人檢控嘅人。

292
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,510
係咪就唔使得幫咧？

293
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,170
噉，當呢個羣體越嚟越大嘅時候。

294
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,320
我啲人呢個羣體多咗。

295
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,670
係咪唔公義嘅案件會更加多咧？

296
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,140
即係原來法律係。

297
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,940
佢話：阿峯，你知唔知個法字點樣寫㗎？

298
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,900
呢一個嘅觀念咧，喺普羅大眾之中咧。

299
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,430
有錢人，或者係社會上層嘅玩玩玩意。

300
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:25,270
嗰啲人好多都係誒出身係。

301
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:31,690
並非富裕，佢哋畀人告嘅時候都好大嘅係艱難，要去籌錢打官司。

302
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:17,740
法字係三點水，做個去字啊！即係點解啊？有水先至可以去馬。

303
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:06,120
我自己都係法律背景出身啦，我我都好記得喺律師樓做個實習嘅時候，有一位師兄同我講過。

304
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:50,300
我諗喺即係近年嘅政治檢控案件，好多嘅政治嘅司法誒嘅案件、刑事檢控嘅案件，大家市民咧係有眼睇，我都唔使唔需要多講。

305
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,260
畀政府告嘅人。

306
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,080
係唔係？

307
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,170
發緩，即使係待遇唔好。

308
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,520
係應該出現嘅情況咧，窮人。

309
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:52,100
面對一啲被刑事起訴起訴嘅人，佢哋都係有血有肉嘅人。

310
01:07:55,030 --> 01:08:00,370
就係可以用呢啲案件嚟畀佢做一啲事業嘅階梯嘅。

311
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:36,510
咁所以就翻翻去，即係每每兩年一次嘅檢討機制裏邊咧。

312
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:17,290
有一個普遍性，即係出現咗嘅話，呢個係咪我哋香港嘅刑事嘅法律裏邊？

313
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,930
係可以攞嚟做白老鼠嘅，係畀一班律師嚟係試煉嘅，唔應該係咁㗎嘛。

314
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:09,860
嗱，當然唔會唔會好多個每個律師都係咁諗啦，當然唔會每個大狀都係噉樣嚟睇呢件事啦，但係如果事實，

315
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:52,930
咁喺另一方面咧，我哋又諗，即係當呢個情況出現咗嘅時候，我哋又諗下喎，即係有啲有人有另一個意見就係話，哦咁刑事嘅。

316
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:25,970
攞多啲實戰經驗，去攞多啲嘅係誒喺行內嘅地位，你先至出去再闖啦。咁好多時咧，即係。

317
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:46,910
攞去係畀新仔去浸嘅，喺嗰度攞得經驗嘅。但係我哋諗下，你每一個case每一個案件。

318
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:37,180
會唔會畀公眾有一個感覺，或者真係實在行業內有一個噉嘅現實，就係喂，原來做刑事法援嗰啲就係啲新仔嘅階梯嚟嘅。

319
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:42,720
始終係揮之不去嘅，即係如果你問下，即係我哋前線，即係接觸得誒社會最前線嘅市民最多嘅話咧，市民依然都係有呢個觀感喺裏邊。

320
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:16,800
都好都有啲後生仔去做啊！我哋都知道，尤其是做大律師添，或者律師都係啦。入行嘅時候都係艱難嘅，即係要要揾到case去接，去揾到你嘅客仔唔容易㗎。哇！好多人都話啊，噉你可以不如去做刑事法援先啦，去操練下自己，去到。

321
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,970
呢個係。

322
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,740
係咪都係好應該嘅做法咧？

323
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:15,760
咁如果嗱，我哋要記住。

324
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:41,090
係唔係真係質素參差咧？

325
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,770
而家執業緊嗰啲律師同埋大律師。

326
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,300
係咪應該都係檢討嘅機制同埋準則之一咧？

327
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,530
嘅即係甲類丙類嗰啲檢討之外。

328
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,160
都去有人去做嘅時候，就等於冇出現困難。

329
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,290
我諗係政府係好應該去深切檢討，咁所以。

330
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:34,380
誒刑事嘅發緩，實質上。

331
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:43,570
請大律師嗰陣，同埋請律師嘅時候，有冇出現困難？我頭先所講嘅全部都係困難咯。

332
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:13,920
未來再有係兩年一次檢討嘅時候，除咗通脹通縮，除咗物價。

333
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:53,900
政府係咪應該繼續用呢種心態？有人捱氣去做，有人覺得做得唔係好好，質素唔係好高，經驗唔係好夠。

334
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:51,630
係咪可唔可以係檢討埋，將佢納入為考慮？就係民事同埋刑事之間係嘅法援嗰個差距。

335
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:29,220
除咗講緊係請唔請到律師之外，可唔可以將每兩年一次嘅檢討都納入埋頭先我所講嘅一啲嘅範疇咧？講緊就係。

336
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:10,180
即係當然，民事同刑事嘅法律嘅本質係唔同嘅，即係喺唔同嘅場合有唔同嘅。即係政府又好，法律界都講過，冇可能將佢水平拉到一模一樣嘅，即係可能係一個好理想嘅做法。但係再拉近啲。

337
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,740
我哋係。

338
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,220
刑事罰款咁低水平裏邊咧。

339
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,090
所以呢個道道理好顯淺。

340
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,590
咁所以喺呢個咁低嘅水平。

341
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:57,040
即係，如果我哋唔正視呢個問題。

342
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:54,420
如果個個案係好冗長，個案卷係好複雜。

343
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:59,300
其實咧係會有個封頂嘅，即係佢最多都係攞咁多嘅啫。

344
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:10,660
如果個案件越複雜，佢即係行公糧值係應該係收多啲報酬嘅。

345
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,970
咁但係如果你出翻去一個即係刑事嘅案件，唔係法援啦嘅市場價。

346
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:40,110
你又點樣叫呢呢位律師或者呢位大律師去可以係？

347
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:50,430
誒，佢哋當然誒會去到一個程度，去接一個係個案。

348
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:18,980
原來喺刑事法務裏邊，除咗個水平低之外，佢仲仲要即係有個限限額咁高，係限定。

349
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:26,620
我哋講緊都係畀錢啫，畀多啲畀多啲去支援係刑事嘅法援嘅律師同埋大律師，畀佢好啲嘅待遇。

350
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:51,370
做得甘心命底，亦都係保持到個係質素，亦都係繼續吸引有經驗嘅係律師或者大律師去繼續參與呢啲刑事嘅法律案件咧。

351
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:38,990
我哋知道咧，即係誒頭先多位發言嘅，即係執業嘅律師都講有提過，佢哋嘅誒薪酬好多時都係斷係時薪計。

352
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:34,370
咁個案件越複雜越長，只會令佢個水平就要拉越遠嘅。個案件本來係應該牽涉好多重費，但係佢如果一個法援嘅律師，刑事法援律師，佢做落去後面嘅話咧，拉長咗咧，基本上全部都係義工嚟嘅。

353
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,620
最低嘅先畀你。

354
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,320
繼續將法援。

355
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,950
公義嘅彰顯嘅時候。

356
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,150
legally aided criminal cases.

357
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:16,470
咁簡單嘅加幅，加多啲都唔肯咧。

358
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,270
呢一樣嘢本身係佢輕視，特別係刑事法援裏邊。

359
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:11,820
係咪我哋庫房好缺錢？連呢啲係。

360
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:23,790
係咪？如果講緊，如果用錢嚟衡量，即係法律嘅係。

361
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:47,460
for legal aid lawyer on criminal cases is much lower than the one in civil cases.

362
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:42,850
唔通即係發還嘅服務，即係好似即係好似英國有啲人咁提出過啦，要投標投翻嚟嘅。

363
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:34,420
我哋慳多啲錢仲好嘅話咧，係咪要遲啲發還嘅服務係要價低者得，政府先至開心咧？

364
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:54,610
唔通香港嘅即係對於法律，對於係特別係刑事，對一般市民對窮人嘅法律支援，係去到呢個價值咩？

365
01:12:54,890 --> 01:13:11,910
如果我哋唔想行到嗰步嘅話咧，我希望即係喺呢個辯論裏邊，透過呢四個percent嘅加幅咧，我當然會支持佢加，但係都好好心思我哋對法律同埋市民對公義嘅追求。雖然我時間係差唔多，一次差。二。

366
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:40,410
Mr. President, we are talking about the review of legal aid costs for criminal cases based on the price index today, and I surely support the proposed bill today. But I would also voice out my concern. Over the years, as my colleagues have rightly pointed out, the cost

367
01:13:47,760 --> 01:14:07,770
Having reviewed the cost for instructing solicitors on hourly basis with a 25% increase for hourly fee, which is done around a year ago, I reckon it's still lagging behind the cost for civil cases in an.

368
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:27,780
In a nutshell, Mr. President, I believe we should carry out a reform on the costs for criminal services in the long run. After all, access to justice is of paramount importance to us, and we must provide adequate incentive for high-calibre lawyers to take part in.

369
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,760
啊。

370
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,530
what we do today marks the beginning of a long journey.

371
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:39,500
And going forward, there would be a lot of things to be done. We can't just simply pass the bill now and call it a day. We can't do that.

372
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:09,790
有一個誒誒大幅度嘅調整啊！呢一個咧，我都係期待，希望呢個工作小組咧係可以有一個誒公佈㗎。

373
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:41,630
去參與呢一啲嘅法律援助嘅刑事案件嘅，咁所以咧，我相信咧呢一個長遠嘅一個嘅啊檢視咧，係有需要去進行嘅。

374
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:39,960
下指數嘅調整之後咧，都依然係仲希望佢哋係能夠咧，可以稍後咧作一個比較全面嘅檢討，係特別係關於呢一個法律援助刑事案件嘅費用嘅誒問題。

375
01:14:45,040 --> 01:15:05,050
啊！主席，我爭啲忘記咗我要申報我係誒執業律師咧。啊，今日咧，我哋講緊嘅呢個按照丙類嘅物價消費指數咧，去調整刑事案件咧發緩方面嘅嗰個費用咧。啊，當然我係贊成嘅，但同樣地咧，我都係要指出咧。

376
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:25,060
其實，正如我哋今日好多嘅朋友亦都提到，啊，確實咧喺刑事案件嚟講咧，誒法律援助可以畀到律師嘅費用咧，係仲係遠遠少於民事嘅案件嘅。咁如果我哋舉個例去睇咧，就係啊，大概喺一年多之前咧，其實。

377
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:45,070
政府係建議過咧，就係將呢一個嘅發還嘅刑事案件誒事務律師嘅每個鐘頭嘅嗰個費用咧，係由八百蚊係調升到一千蚊。咁但係咧，如果我哋睇翻咧，而家我哋律師會畀我哋嘅指引咧，其實有十年經驗嘅事務律師咧，一個鐘頭咧收嘅收。

378
01:15:45,070 --> 01:16:05,080
費係收四千蚊嘅，咁所以咧喺呢個數字上嚟講，我哋都係睇到咧。儘管之前咧係有所嘅調整，然而咧都仲係大幅咧係落後。誒結果咧係會出現一種情況咧，就正如我哋法律界經常都講，啲行家都話咧，有時碰到一啲法。

379
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:25,090
門嘅刑事案件咧，有啲朋友就會覺得好似一種豬頭骨噉樣啊，好似嗰個費用又好少，又好似有啲行家又覺得唔係好值得做嗱。其實如果係咁咧，主席對於我哋整個法律體係嚟講咧，都未必係好健康嘅。咁所以咧，我相信咧，希望局方咧喺今次丙類物價。

380
01:16:40,330 --> 01:17:00,340
我今日咧亦都聽到有啲同事提咧，就話咧，其實呢一個法律援助刑事案件嘅費用咧，係將來應該係同市場咧係要掛鈎嘅。咁喺呢度咧都值得要提一點咧，就係話所謂同嗰個市場掛鈎咧，其實早喺一段時間之前咧，啊，我哋嘅終審。

381
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:20,350
法院嘅大法官係已經委任咗到工作小組咧，係進行呢方面嘅研究。咁咧就據我嘅瞭解咧，就其實第一階段咧係初步完成，咁準備咧係進行第二階段嘅研究。正正就係要研究咧係誒律師嘅每一個小時嘅收費咧係有冇？

382
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:40,360
好需要咧，係作出一個啊比較大幅度嘅調整。而咧，如果我哋睇翻歷史嚟講咧，對上一次咧，我哋係檢討過整體嘅律師嘅每小時嘅收費咧，最後一次已經係講緊一九九七年啦。主席呢個已經係大概二十年前嘅事。

383
01:17:40,360 --> 01:18:00,370
咁所以咧，我都希望咧啊，工作小組我都期待稍後咧係會有一個嘅全面嘅公佈。對於佢哋嘅研究，對於呢一個律師嘅收費啊，喺市場上面一直我哋二十年嚟冇乜點改動過嘅一個每小時嘅收費，係咪應該咧與時並進咧？

384
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:30,080
啊！主席，翻翻去我哋講呢個刑事案件法律援助嘅費用嘅呢一個問題咧，其實而家我哋見到咧，如果長期啊呢一個費用提供係唔係好吸引嘅時候咧，的而且確咧，我哋亦都好難可以吸引到一啲係比較資深嘅啊律師咧。

385
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,060
一。

386
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,700
係，主席。

387
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,840
所以喺呢個問題上邊咧。

388
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:26,590
未必一定可以噉樣進行到，咁不過咧，整體嚟講咧。

389
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:27,520
其實我哋都未掂到成個發緩嘅問題嘅核心。

390
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:57,020
引一啲係啊，可能比較資深嘅律師咧，係亦都係願意去參與嘅啊！誒，主席誒，我僅此陳詞。胡志偉議員。

391
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:20,530
而法律援助嘅服務咧，正好就係要彌補呢一部分嘅可能嘅不足之處，就係要針對經濟能力欠佳嘅基層市民，佢都應該係獲得合理嘅一個係法律嘅權益。

392
01:21:49,340 --> 01:22:05,890
第三十八條都講咗，香港居民係享有香港特別行政區法律保障嘅其他權利同埋自由。呢三條都定明咗，香港居民應該係受到應有嘅法律保障，政府都有責任咧，係確保司法程序嘅公平、公正同埋公開透明嘅。

393
01:18:42,100 --> 01:19:02,110
但係，我亦都今日聽到咧，有啲同事係指出咧，就係話誒，關於將來咧，我哋嗰個律師嘅刑事案件嘅法律援助嘅收費係唔係可以咧去作一啲嘅所謂同一啲律師嘅排名咧作一啲掛鈎嗱。我今朝咧啊，剛才我聽到。

394
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:22,120
陳志全議員有個噉樣嘅建議啊，容許我咁講咧，就係話誒呢個建議咧，可能都比較難去執行嘅。嗱，而家容許我咁講咧，就係話誒第一咧，如果你話真係要所謂對我哋嘅啊事務律師咧，去作為一個嘅所謂執業裡面嘅一種嘅排名咧，我相信咧。

395
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:42,130
咧都係有所困難。第一樣嘢咧就係啊，我哋行家自己都好清楚啦。其實啊，唔同嘅律師咧有好多時咧，佢做嘅案件咧啊，或者佢所謂我哋講嘅比較多嘅專注嘅範圍，亦都有所不同。甚至乎應該講咧，就係有一啲嘅行家比較佢比較多做啊。

396
01:19:42,130 --> 01:20:02,140
啊，例如話訴訟，訴訟裏面都仲有再分咧，就係可能係工傷意外嘅訴訟啦，或者係有一啲嘅商業糾紛嘅訴訟啦、離婚嘅訴訟啦、嚇等等啦。嚇呢一啲種種嘅唔同嘅情況咧，係如果加起上嚟咧，其實都比較複雜。所以咧，誒，我哋如果話係要

397
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:22,150
按一個建議去睇，話要按照一啲律師嘅排名去決定嗰個法律援助嗰個刑事案件嘅費用點樣去去處理咧。我諗咧呢一個就真係喺處理上咧係相當有一定困難嘅。咁所以咧，我諗咧呢一個建議咧，容許我喺度發言嘅時候咧係指出咧係。

398
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:46,880
誒對於嗰個我都再三重申咧，對於誒刑事案件法律援助提供嗰個費用咧，係我認為應該長遠嚟講咧係有一個比較大幅度嘅調整，以追上咧而家咧喺民事案件係畀到嗰個費用嘅水平。希望咧再次咧，正如我剛才所指出咧，係給。

399
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:22,210
喺誒今次嘅刑事訴訟程序條例嘅決議案咧，當然其實好清楚都簡單咧，只係講就話要提高法援喺處理刑事案件嘅費用。不過單單係講緊係嗰個費用嘅係調高調低。

400
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:48,530
事實上，我哋睇翻《基本法》第二十五條咧，定明咗香港居民喺法律面前一律平等。第三十五條係指出，香港居民係有權得到秘密法律嘅諮詢，向法院提起嘅訴訟係選擇律師，及時保護自己嘅合法權益。

401
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,450
收費。

402
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:47,370
所以喺成個問題上邊咧。

403
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:13,820
唔係能夠令到工藝得到彰顯嘅全部嘅元素。

404
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:40,710
係要將喺人嘅面前，而唔係只係存在喺個就噉嘅一個即係表面嘅功夫。

405
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:06,760
十年咧，律政署嘅預算係去到十七億，每一年嘅預算費係十七億，但係法律援助署嘅預算費用咧，仍然每年都係停留喺四至五億之間。

406
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:14,540
公信力咧，亦都因為佢係成日獨立機關嘅時間咧，係更加能夠係彰顯到喺市民面前對法治嘅信心。呢個都對於我哋實施一國兩制、港人治港、高度自治咧，係一個非常之重要嘅元素嚟嘅。

407
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:22,410
呢個係咩嘅意思咧？就係話，其實喺呢十年之間咧，喺十年之前咧，大概係律政署同埋法援處嗰個嘅係財政預算咧，係差唔多嘅。咁但係經過呢十年之後咧，其實兩者之間嘅分別咧，已經係有個好大嘅距離啦。

408
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:42,590
呢個距離咧，當然亦都有另一點要提嘅，就係話誒喺法援處嘅分目二零八項下邊咧，法援法律援助經費喺誒過咁多年咧，嗰個核准預算咧都維持喺大概係五五億度噉，但係實際嘅開支咧都係只係四億多少少嘅錢。

409
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:44,590
正如係啊，局長喺七今年七月份喺議案提出動議嘅時候已經講過一次㗎啦，就係發還政策嘅目標其實就係要確保所有符合喺法律援助條例規定而具備合理理據喺香港法院提出訴訟同埋抗辯嘅人咧，係唔會因為缺乏經濟能力係而無法尋求公義嘅。

410
01:22:47,840 --> 01:23:07,850
經濟條件、經濟上邊固然係一個好重要嘅因素，但係更加重要嘅其實我哋通過呢個過程咧，係令到係公義係唔僅不單止得到伸張，而且係要彰顯喺人嘅前面。換言之，就係話我哋誒增加法律援助計劃下邊嘅收。

411
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:34,110
我哋睇翻而家嘅法律制，而家法律援制度，其實大律師公會、民主黨或者好多市民咧，都一直要求法律援助處咧能夠成為一獨立嘅係法定機關嘅。咁當然喺今次嘅檢討裏邊咧，係唔存在呢個部分嘅。但係我都想指出就話，正如我剛才所講，呢一個嘅係誒公義嘅伸張咧，亦都要。

412
01:23:41,440 --> 01:24:01,450
事實上，近年嘅司法複核嘅案件不斷增加，亦都出現咗好多政治檢控嘅事件。因此，將法律援助處成為獨立機關咧，其實係有佢嗰個嘅係迫切性，因為咧係更加能夠體現得到喺呢個過程裏邊咧係會令到市民唔會質疑法律援助處只係政府嘅一部分，佢嘅公。

413
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:35,910
大師公會係提就住倒立花園，提咗好多好多意見。政府亦都曾經進行過研究。咁喺二零一三一二一三年嘅時間，亦都做過一份嘅報告，就係有個叫做Consultancy Study on the Feasibility and Desirability of Establishing an Independent Legal Aid Authority。當然喺。

414
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:55,920
呢個報告裏邊咧就講到就係話政府咧係冇為發還設定呢個財政預算嘅上限，所以都睇唔到政府有幹預有關嘅行為，亦都因為噉樣樣，所以就唔需要成立呢個獨立嘅機關。不過，想指出一點就係咧，誒，如果大家留意到一組數字嘅話咧，事實上係見到另一個景象嘅，就喺過去嗰十。

415
01:25:42,870 --> 01:26:02,880
所以呢個咪有個現象咧，就係反映咗就係話，即係其實嗯政府喺定定呢個預算嘅時間，係咪有一種嘅係無形嘅預算上限咧？而客觀上頭，因為好多同事都指出咗，就話而家嗰個嘅係即係嗯刑事發還嘅係費用個調整咧，係。

416
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:22,890
係每年都係講緊，或者每兩年嘅調整咧，按照呢個並例並類嘅係消費物價指數調整嘅時間，其實係遠遠都唔能夠追得上，係喺嗰個行裏邊正常嘅法律費用嘅增加嘅。從呢個角度，亦都可能係反映咗喺呢一組嘅數字上邊，點解我哋嘅預算上限咧，好似一路咁多年嚟都。

417
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,310
睇先嚇，唔好意思。

418
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,730
喺噉嘅背景下邊咧，亦都係。

419
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:32,180
主席，我其實想指出就係話咧，喺。

420
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:52,110
一至四年之間咧，係佔絕大多數嘅，我。

421
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:27,240
keep係一個大致上平穩嘅係四至五億之間嘅數字。

422
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:53,150
係咪足以係應對到喺個行業裏邊正常嘅一個律師嘅費用？

423
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,130
睇到一組數字咧，就係話年資一般嚟講咧，係誒年資三年以下，三至五年嘅係誒。

424
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:47,800
其實我想指出另一個嘅係資料咧，就係話喺過去呢即係好長嘅時間裏邊咧，其實大部分嘅法援律師咧，其實佢嘅經驗咧，佢嘅經驗咧都只係喺。

425
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:31,820
最重要最重要，可能第一關咧就係當我哋喺警方嘅拘留過程裏邊要作第一份口供嘅時間，能夠獲得到嘅係即係法律嘅支援。如果呢個部分咧係能夠係及早去擴展嘅話，其實對於一般嘅市民大眾咧喺面對喺警

426
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:56,170
喺嗰個背景下邊咧，政府喺定定呢一個財政預算案分目二零八項嘅時候咧，佢係指出咗係會考慮好多唔同嘅因素嘅，包括咗就發還經費嘅支出、有關法律費用嘅轉變，以致發還之下普通計劃涵蓋範圍嘅轉變。噉我亦都睇翻咧喺型。

427
01:26:56,170 --> 01:27:16,180
一六年二月份，政府提交畀政府我哋法律會立法會嘅提交文件嘅時間咧，係大幅度增加咗我哋嘅係即係呢一個喺刑事法援之下嘅大律師嘅費用喺呢個建議當中咧，我哋會見到即係一個十年工作經驗嘅大律師咧，係嗰個接辦案件之下咧。

428
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:36,270
係大概原來計劃咧一千五百蚊，好係而接類似嘅原眾法庭嘅法民事案件咧，一個十年工作經驗嘅律師咧，一般係收取四千蚊，因為佢哋好遠之下咧，所以政府亦都係要大幅上調相關嘅費用嘅。但係喺呢個刑事嘅案件上邊咧，就冇得到呢一個相同嘅考慮。其實。

429
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:26,940
我哋會睇到咧，就係話喺法援委派嘅律師案接辦呢個刑事案件嘅部分咧，其實係因為嗰個嘅係即係誒嗰個費用嘅調整有個改善之後咧，其實係會見到啲相對地資深嘅律師咧，係會多咗係接辦有關嘅案件嘅。咁但係相同嘅處境咧喺刑事案件上邊咧，其實因為有。

430
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:46,950
呢個調整咧係處理唔到噉，因此就係我亦都好希望就係話，除咗今日所講嘅係按照丙類消費物價指數去調整而家嘅刑事律誒法援嘅刑事律師嗰個嘅係費用之外，呢個一般調整之外咧，其實都應該係要嚴縮同埋大幅度噉樣樣咧去考慮。實質上，我哋而家所支付嘅係即係法律費用咧。

431
01:28:54,260 --> 01:29:14,270
喺今年嘅七月份，政府提交嘅文件，文件提過，如果提過另一個概念，就係話將法律援助嘅係擴展去到呢個被扣留在警署人士，去提供呢個法律諮詢嘅係服務嘅建議。我覺得呢個係好重要嘅概念嚟嘅。事實上，頭先我同事提到就話喺個成個刑事嘅係審議嘅過程裏邊咧，其實。

432
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:52,110
嗰被拘留要落口供嘅時間咧，其實佢所得到嘅支援咧係會更大嘅。我哋都好清楚知道啦，喺誒警方落口供嘅時間咧，就往往係會改動名制誒。而而家你所説嘅所有情，即係而家你你唔係事必要你講，不過你所講嘅所有內容咧，都會呈堂成為呈堂證供嘅。

433
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,500
向咗佢喺法律權利上邊應該有嘅公義嘅伸展嘅。

434
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:14,120
法律權益咧，係得到一個全面嘅係涵蓋同埋保障。

435
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:14,250
主席，我係我嘅發言咧，誒去到尾聲啦，所以我亦都想講就話喺今次嘅係即係相關嘅係呢一個。

436
01:33:54,610 --> 01:34:05,030
去參考去探討，就話究竟係個案情係應該點樣處理，同埋有啲咩更好嘅方法係可以應對到喺嗰個法律上面，佢嘅權益所得到嘅應該有嘅維護。

437
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:49,050
第一步，當佢係面對呢一個警方拘留嘅時間，要落呢份口供，而佢嗰份口供其實係對佢嗰個嘅往後嘅審訊咧，係非常重要嘅時間咧，係能夠獲得應該有嘅法律權益。

438
01:29:52,110 --> 01:30:12,120
一部分，但係原來喺我哋日常嘅工作經驗裏邊咧，好多好多市民大眾根本就唔掌握呢一句説話嘅實質含義係啲咩嘢。佢甚至就話喺個喺個落口供嘅過程裏邊咧，係往往係會因為噉，因為唔掌握自己嘅法律權益咧，係會係被呢一個嘅誒講咗啲説話咧，係影響。

439
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:35,930
所以，我覺得呢一個計劃咧係誒，雖然而家個試驗計劃，但係都應該喺下次嘅檢討當中咧，能夠盡快盡快咧係擺上嚟我哋嘅立法會當中，係令到即係有關嘅部分咧係能夠成為一個係實際可行嘅做法，係去令到市民大眾嘅法律權益咧唔單止保障喺訴訟嘅過程裏邊，亦都係保障喺佢。

440
01:30:50,430 --> 01:31:10,440
喺今次嘅決議案有誒好法，令到發緩喺多項嘅收費能夠係按通脹增加，相信我哋都係好歡迎嘅。事實上，我哋都歡迎嘅。不過喺呢個調整收費嘅過程裏邊，始終都係唔能夠咧係即係回應到有關嗰個嘅係發緩制度背後嘅理念啦，同埋政策嘅目標，係令到所有有。

441
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:30,450
需要嘅人士咧，係得到法律嘅保障，令到市民對法援嘅制度有信心，能夠彰顯到公義。所以喺技術層面，誒或者從呢一個法律改革角度嚟睇，今次嘅決議案咧係只係處理到成個法律能夠彰顯公義呢一個過程嘅一個部分，係一個相當細嘅部分。

442
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:50,460
而頭先所講嘅係佢應該要覆蓋其他不足嘅地方咧，事實上仍然有個好大嘅距離，包括咗就話係唔係應該具體去執行呢一個讓法援係成為一個獨立嘅機構，係將呢個法援嘅覆蓋範圍係延伸去到呢一個被拘留嘅人士誒，種種其實都係需要我哋進一步。

443
01:31:50,460 --> 01:32:10,470
去探討嘅，事實上呢個討論亦都係有唔同嘅場合，經年累月噉樣討論，但係似乎未有進一步嘅嘅一個誒，即係決心咧，去顯示到政府有決心，希望能夠咧係透過呢個法律援助嘅制度咧，去確保我哋香港市民喺《基本法》第二十五條、三十五同三十八條裏邊所應該有。

444
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:34,510
另一個部分咧，亦都係想指出嘅喺法援之外咧，亦都係我哋喺市民大眾而家相當之依賴嘅係即係誒法律權益嘅保障嘅一個環節，就係話有關呢個係當值律師計劃噉，可能同呢一個誒問題咧係有少少即係唔一致嘅地方，但係我都想指出呢個係我哋成個係喺法律制度裏邊保。

445
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:54,520
向市民權益嘅一個部分，現時大約有一千二百名嘅大律師同埋律師咧，係參與呢個當值律師嘅計劃。喺聆訊嘅過程裏邊，往往都係會喺即係案件開始之前嘅九點鐘咧，要去到呢個法庭上面揾當值律師，咁令到佢咧係可以喺好短時間裏邊聽咗你嘅意見之後咧，就協助你可能係去認罪啦，可能係去即係。

446
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:14,530
誒誒求情啦，咁其實咧就往往令到呢個計劃嘅本身咧，止於就係話個市民大眾能夠係獲得可能畀幾百蚊咧，係去協助佢喺個法庭上邊咧係進行求情嘅工作，或者係由個律師係話畀佢聽，你呢個案件實際上係會有啲乜嘢嘅係誒後後果之後咧，可能決定。

447
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:34,540
認罪都唔頂噉，但係咁短嘅時間，其實係會令到咧，係市民大眾嗰個法律權益咧，亦都係即係喺咁闖闖住嘅環境之下咧，係令到大家有擔心，亦都有質疑，就係話究竟係咪得到充分嘅一個嘅係法律意見，令到佢作出一個決定嘅時間咧，係能夠最能夠維護到佢應該有嘅法律權益。

448
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,980
即係其他議員。

449
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,160
正從太遠。

450
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,180
啊，陳樹祥又。

451
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,480
香港市民信服㗎，咁呢層次支持同意，多主席。

452
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:45,360
我據我自己一誒嘅統計所知咧。

453
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:04,780
誒要求點算法定人數？多謝主席。

454
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:27,230
佢能夠買翻我哋一個政治中立嘅一個嘅政府部門的話，噉我覺得呢個錢係即係應該畀。

455
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:47,070
我相信咧，大部分議員咧都對於呢一個嘅刑事化緩費用嘅調整咧冇乜太大爭議，都係即係大部分都會認同。

456
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:19,940
擔心嘅問題，尤其係抗爭者佢哋擔心，法援處會唔會喺審批法援期間係有一個政治審查嘅情況？啲一切一切，我認為由個結論去講嘅話，如果能夠畀錢，

457
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:41,610
但係事實上，我哋有好多案例都見到，今日法援助處唔係話備受一啲批評話係濫發法援嗰個情況，而係佢哋係可能OK，可能係有政治審查嘅狀況。

458
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:54,610
所以喺咁闖住嘅狀態之下，你話叫律當值律師係去給予最好嘅意見嘅話，誒往往都因為時間嘅關係咧，係有佢嘅難度嘅。所以我諗喺呢個部分咧，係咪應該要檢視一下？譬如話將呢個當值律師計劃咧係有個調整啦，唔好喺當天嘅早上係出現呢一件事，可以早啲嘅時間咧係可以同呢個律師。

459
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:34,580
決議案當中咧，民主黨係會支持你嘅決議案嘅，亦都好希望咧喺呢個決議案裏邊咧，大家會睇得到我哋嘅發言咧，其實針對緊就係話係喺而家成套嘅係法律援助制度當中，佢如何能夠係有效去彰顯呢個公義，係都呢個彰顯公義咧，唔單止係寫文件上面，亦都應該係要。

460
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:54,590
清楚向成個社會咧係表述得到，特別就係話究竟而家我哋嘅係法律援助係唔係存在住？大家頭先見到好似一個模型嘅模型嘅上限，而令到就係相關嘅係法援嘅使用咧，即係就算你冇都好咧，都會覺得誒係咪有啲問題咧？而到最後就都幾得意嘅。

461
01:34:54,590 --> 01:35:14,600
就係即係過往咧，呢個法律援助處咧就放咗喺即係阿阿局長之下去處理嘅，咁但係稍時間咧就要翻咗去呢個張建忠即係C.S領導之下嘅嘅嘅嘅一個層次，噉係咪就咁改變咗嗰個結構，就等於就係話係獨立咗咧噉樣樣？噉我自己覺得就係話，即係如果呢一個。

462
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:34,610
個目標個話咧，似乎係唔足夠去彰顯到法律援助喺個社會當中能夠顯示嘅係佢嗰個嘅係即係公義嘅彰顯。咁誒更加有效嘅方法，更加有效嘅方法就係通過頭先講嘅一個獨立嘅法援局咧，係去處理有關嘅問題。咁當然，如果喺阿張建中誒政務司司長下。

463
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:54,620
下邊去管理嘅時間，佢有啲好新、好突破性嘅諗法嘅話，我哋當然係歡迎嘅。咁但係呢個我相信亦都要係見到呢啲具體嘅行為咧，先能夠作進一步嘅判斷。但係如果只係好似而家噉樣樣舊瓶新酒換咗個張建忠係局長、啊司長去處理嘅話，就等於係彰顯公義同埋彰顯獨立性嘅話咧，我相信係絕對唔能夠令。

464
01:47:47,540 --> 01:48:07,550
但係咧，同時我想指出嘅就係話喺呢個討論上面咧，有一樣嘢誒係要集中去處理嘅，就係增加呢一個嘅刑事法援嘅費用，能唔能夠去改善而家法律援助處佢嘅服務質素，甚至能唔能夠嘅就係話係幫我哋去疏解一啲日益。

465
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:31,070
去自己聘請個律師。

466
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,260
係一個本來都係個正常上嘅節目。

467
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:48,610
譬如就住年初二舊年嘅暴動罪。

468
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,230
咁喺噉嘅情況底下，大家可以問一個問題。

469
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:54,200
裏面有大概十個咁上緊嘅一啲發緩嘅申請，一啲抗爭者。

470
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:08,400
亦或者係佢有一個講法，就係不涉及一個重大嘅公眾利益，咁所以咧就係唔予審批。

471
01:48:54,480 --> 01:49:01,180
全部都係被法援署拒絕，而拒絕嘅理由就係只有一個，就係話勝算不大。

472
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:17,430
之但係問題嘅就係話，當中嗰個嘅經濟審查，又或者嗰個嘅案件審查，係如何處理，或者如何去跟進咧？噉。

473
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:26,830
噉我都相信嘅就係法援處裏面，即係有一啲嘅法援處嘅同事，好似頭先郭榮亨議員所講，都係專業同埋中立嘅。

474
01:49:53,630 --> 01:50:03,630
咁當然可能局方或者處方會有回應嘅，就係話咁都有上訴嘅機制，但係我想指出刑事法援嘅上訴機制同民事法援係完全不同。

475
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:15,630
刑事法援嘅上訴機率，如果你話依賴翻法援處去去揾翻自己法援嘅顧問律師或者啲當值律師去做的話，喺個統計上，即係十居其九都係失敗嘅。

476
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:53,160
明明經濟條件係合乎嗰個申請，咁點解所有我講嘅係所有年初二暴動罪嘅發還案嘅申請都係拒絕咧？咁？

477
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:08,950
但係就偏偏嘅就係喺呢個過程裏面，佢哋冇辦法係獲得一個基本作為一個香港人擁有一個嘅法律面前人人平等嘅有基本嘅對待。

478
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:28,910
咁但係，如果佢係要自行或者係要自己去上訴發還拒絕申請嘅話，亦即係話當時啊，或者係喺獄中囚禁緊嘅一個抗爭者，佢係需要。

479
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:40,950
咁但係喺而家呢一個情況嘅話，係令到我哋非常之擔心。究竟法援處會唔會係因應個別一啲嘅案件，又或者係政治嘅背景而作出一啲嘅審查嘅情況咧？

480
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:53,950
一，佢哋本來就已經喺個獄中裏面，無論資訊啦、申請嘅途徑或者方法都係不得知情。第二嘅就係話，喺個獄中裏面，你申請嘅話亦都要等福利官嘅審批，或者福利官一啲嘅通話或者傳話，本來都係一個精神上嘅折磨，或者一個嘅嘅嘅。

481
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,100
噉係嘅，可能係噉嘅情況。

482
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,650
一兩下就係畀人哋話會告你襲警啦噉。

483
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:12,690
咁可以，你話喂呢一個嘅情況係因為？

484
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,920
但係呢一個案例就正正係抗爭者。

485
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:46,790
呢一個嘅案例，我只係想指出，喺近啲幾年。

486
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:12,940
但係，我想指出嘅就係喺呢個政治氣氛底下嘅話，嚟緊講緊嘅可能國歌法嘅設立或者國歌法嘅訂立。

487
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:19,790
法援處嘅內部一啲嘅顧問或者律師、大律師等，去考慮過嗰個案情，即係正説不高噉。

488
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:43,060
從泰議員，我講係嚟提醒你翻翻嚟呢個辯論。你啱啱翻嚟啊，主席，應該就係我都睇見到咧，應該係噉嘅情況。

489
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:16,350
唔好話講到喺呢個年初二暴動咁誇張，跑步都係會畀人哋入罪嘅時候，甚至嘅就係話可能係普通遊行示威。

490
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:53,820
就係被你控告，而佢能夠佢能夠去獲得一個保障，就係一個法律援助嘅制度。

491
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:44,310
而由於一個執法機關係相對缺乏呢個嘅監管，於是係大量嘅可能嘅市民啦，就係因為呢一類型嘅遊行示威，可能行過旺角添，甚至。

492
01:52:54,390 --> 01:53:06,140
去保障佢有一個律師嘅顧問、律師嘅代表。當然可能有見習輝嘅同事唔同意，會同你講嘅就係話：，喂，佢明知有危險，咁咪匿埋唔好走出嚟咯。佢哋都係抗爭者。

493
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:32,470
就正正喺今個政治氣氛底下嘅話，呢一個明網密眾嘅做法就係先告咗你，就係博你根本就冇一個經濟嘅條件去作出嚟嘅控訴。

494
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:41,630
同埋，尤其係而家仲對於香港有一個嘅，即係植根於香港心態嘅人士嚟嘅擔憂，會唔會將來嘅話，法援署甚至響呢一個嘅審批法援期間，係有一個政治嘅考量咧？咁？

495
01:51:47,370 --> 01:52:07,380
尤其係近呢幾年，因為即係可能政治上嘅動盪啦，又或政改上嘅爭拗啦。響過去明顯嘅就係話，政府同埋執法嘅部門，特別係警方，佢對於示威遊行啊，或者對於抗爭者係用一個寧枉勿縱嘅心嘅嘅做法，即係乜你唔理三七廿一，拉咗你翻去先算。

496
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:34,810
抗爭者被捕嘅話，或者佢冇辦法申請到法援。鄭同泰議員，你係咪去錯咗地方，講錯咗個辯論咧？我哋主席，我並冇講錯辯論。如果你係執法公平嘅話，頭先所有議員嘅所有議員嘅發言，你都暫停佢。你要我返回正題，嗰我可以翻到結論。我唔使講曬十五分鐘。

497
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:43,870
簡直暫時。

498
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:46,680
業經營業。

499
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,330
我每用十五分鐘，你放心。

500
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:54,300
去審理主席，有人話黐線喎，喺我度在座。

501
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:16,120
第二嘅就係話，喺個審訊嘅期間，大家唔清楚嘅話，你揾翻而家我哋面對住手頭嘅統計。

502
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:42,190
所以我嘅結論就係好簡單嘅啫。如果用錢能夠買翻我哋嘅政治中立的話，我相信大盤個抗爭出嚟，埋香港人願意。

503
01:54:56,970 --> 01:55:08,430
我想指出嗰個唔係單純抗爭者嘅問題，而喺到噉嘅情況底下嘅話，我哋係再三要思考一個基本嘅問題啫：法援處係咪應該去獨立成為一個法定嘅部門？

504
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:19,600
但係問題嘅就係依家畀我哋見到當前嘅嘅政治嘅局勢，你話遊行示威係抗爭者走出嚟畀人拉係抵死嘅噉，咁大家喂行出嚟嘅噉，如咗要還，你可以咁講。

505
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:49,690
夜可能喺茶樓飲緊茶，加三姑六婆，就係因為播播國歌嘅期間，佢可能就係只係可能笑兩聲，就畀你面容入罪，而佢就係冇一個經濟嘅條件去揾律師。

506
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:31,020
所有年初二嘅暴動罪嘅發還都係拒絕，就係因為勝算不高。發還處判定你勝算不高，於是你去上訴，你就要自己攞錢去高等法院上訴，去打翻個發還嘅拒絕嘅申請，咁錢從何來啊？主席？

507
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:37,080
但係，本來法援嘅精神就係，無論你任何政治嘅背景，你任何嘅種族，你任何嘅立場，都係應該有同等嘅權利。呢一個係法援嘅精神。第二，我想指出嘅就係話，當國歌法定立嘅時候，並唔係講緊抗爭者。

508
01:53:48,060 --> 01:54:06,380
我想講嘅就係話，喺噉嘅政治氣氛底下，法援處佢作為一個我哋以為佢專業或者中立嘅機構，佢審批嘅期間究竟有冇一個政治嘅考量？如果係能夠用呢一個嘅收費調整能夠買翻翻嚟的話，我相信大部分嘅香港人願意畀。
