1
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,050
建議啦。

2
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:54,850
旁聽會議公眾人士需知嘅介紹嚇，希望大家留意。噉就如果冇其他問題咧，我哋馬上開始爭取啲時間啦。首先，我哋請誒香港基督教服務處長者核心業務嘅劉慧恆小姐。

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,010
上開始翻先嚇，噉我哋首先咧就誒歡迎大家，亦都誒提提大家咧，就有幾樣事項嘅。一就係關於我哋嘅誒翻譯方面咧，我哋有誒有零號就係現場版本啦，一號係廣東話版本，二號英文嘅版本，三號咧係普通話嘅版本嘅。第二樣需要提提大家嘅就有關於誒在。

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:40,020
坐咁多位咧，誒，雖然係出席呢個會議，但係咧，由於你哋係唔受呢個佢哋特特權條例所保障嘅，你哋所提交嘅意見書都同樣係不受保障嘅，所以大家亦都留意一樣嘢啦。第三咧，請大家留意下，就喺我哋啊，在職人士嘅誒面前，就或者曾經派發畀大家嘅有關於立法會綜合大樓會議室內出席會議或者公眾席。

5
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:15,140
係多謝主席。咁本人今日咧就想反映下少數族裔長者嘅貧窮狀況嘅。咁本機構嘅意見書咧就早前就已經交咗畀各位㗎啦。咁本港六十五歲以上嘅少數族裔人口咧，就由二零一一年至到二零一六年咧就增加咗一倍有多嘅。咁根據二零一四年研究嘅指示咧，誒社聯嘅研究。

6
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:35,150
只是少數作業長者嘅貧窮率咧，就係超過咗三十四percent。咁呢個狀況咧就係好值得我哋嘅關注啦。咁根據我哋嘅服務觀察，雖然咧政府就推出咗好多扶貧嘅措施，但係似乎就未惠及到呢個少數作業長者。喺呢度我都好想同大家去分享一個嘅個案。噉佢哋同我哋好多少數作業長者面對緊嘅狀況都係好相似嘅。

7
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:55,160
因為呢個個案係一對七十幾歲嘅尼泊爾誒洋夫婦啦，同屋企人一齊住，兩夫婦冇任何嘅儲蓄同埋資產，咁每個月咧就係靠佢屋企人畀好少嘅資誒生活費畀佢哋啦。噉佢哋嘅狀況咧，同我哋接觸咗八成嘅長者嘅狀況都係一樣，經濟上有需要，但就冇申請到任何嘅經濟援助，因為根本就唔。

8
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:15,170
唔知道、唔識同埋或者好睏難。咁呢對夫婦喺香港住咗誒都有成十年㗎啦，但係連香港永久性居民身份證都係唔知道點樣申請。佢哋同其他長者一樣，都係有誒唔同嘅病痛啦，但係就唔知道醫療券呢個計劃。咁事實上喺我哋嘅計劃裡面咧，有超過九成嘅長者咧喺接觸我哋計劃之前咧，其實。

9
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:35,180
佢哋係從來都冇聽過醫療券呢樣嘢嘅，噉我哋咧亦都有同佢哋介紹誒長者生活津貼啦。但得佢哋聽到嘅時候就好開心，同埋好有希望。但係申請嘅過程裡面就好睏難，因為而家嘅公共福利金咧就只能夠透過個人嘅户口咧就係發放嘅。但係銀行就因為咧兩老就唔識中英文啦，咁而拒絕係為佢哋開户。

10
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:55,190
户口後嚟咧，誒，我哋經過一翻即係努力之後，聯絡咗社署嘅職員，社署就寫咗封信畀銀行，銀行先肯開畀佢哋啦。咁除咗佢哋之外，我哋亦都有好多長者同佢哋嘅狀況都係一樣。誒，當佢知道咗銀行唔開户口畀佢嘅時候咧，佢就已經冇再申請其他嘅誒，即係福利金嗰啲嘢啦。咁誒，我哋都有啲嘅。

11
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:16,340
咁咧就政府除咗積極做好各樣嘅長者相關嘅福利措施同埋服務資料嘅翻譯工作之外咧，我哋而家建議整合呢啲資料成為一個資源套，同埋透過一站式嘅網上平台就發放，令到佢長者同埋佢嘅照顧者咧都能夠係獲得到所需嘅資訊啦。第二咧就建議政府喺定立呢個平等。

12
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:36,350
促進誒種族平等嘅措施清單裏面咧，列明少數族裔長者誒，如果要求嘅話咧，佢嘅職員就必須為佢提供呢個傳譯嘅支支援啦。第三就提升呢個安老服務人員嘅敏感度，提升提供呢個資源畀呢個安老服務單位解決佢嘅語言障礙啦。亦都鼓勵呢啲安老服務為少數族裔長。

13
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:56,360
長者提供回應佢哋文化需要嘅服務啦。最後尾咧，我哋亦都誒希望政府能夠誒根據而家現有嘅數據分析少數族裔長者佢嘅貧窮狀況啦，同埋監管佢嘅狀況啦，亦都進行有關少數族裔長者嘅研究，瞭解佢哋嘅生活實況、服務需要，發展一套有效嘅服務模式。咁香港嘅人。

14
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:16,370
人口老化咧就已經誒，即係引起誒廣泛嘅關注。咁少數族裔長者嘅老齡化咧，熱嘅趨勢亦都係不容忽視嘅。我哋今日咧就唔單單正視少數族裔長者嘅貧窮問題，更加為咧未來少數族裔長者嘅人口老化嘅挑戰做好準備。唔該曬，唔該，唔該，主持人，We now invite Miss Deborah Jones, please.

15
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,040
用中文喺日常溝通。

16
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,310
We now invite Mr. Abbas Arif, please.

17
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,110
我 really want the government to do something which helps ethnic minority students on the long run.

18
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:32,820
us ethnic minority students，it it would be easy for us to integrate to society with a better Chinese level。

19
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,660
If more effort is put on us, then I'm sure that we'll be able to learn Chinese to the level which is required in this society.

20
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:39,550
many universities in Hong Kong only require grade C, which is a pass in GCSE examinations, which seems to be a pretty easy requirement. However, I think that the government does not understand that getting into university does not mean that we'll be able to find a job in the future.

21
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:14,660
主流 kindergarten， now I'm in now I'm studying in secondary school and I learn a easier level easier Chinese level. I have tried local Chinese form for test papers and to be honest I wouldn't say that it was so hard but I was able to understand the content.

22
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:50,560
to conclude this, I would request the government to spend the money wisely on the education sector and help us non-Chinese speaking students to learn Chinese till the level which is needed in the society, instead of only aiming at providing us an easier way for getting into universities. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Jones.

23
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:11,140
多謝，多謝主席。噉我我係Arif Abbas，中文名就係簡柏斯。噉我係香港人嚟嘅，咁住咗香港廿幾年啦。咁個問題就係咧，住咗香港廿幾年，依然都係呢啲問題嘅。咁點解有呢啲問題咧？其實我唔知政府做緊啲咩啦，做咗好多嘢，擺咗好多錢去曬邊。

24
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:25,870
There are many programs outside which help us ethnic minority students to build a better Chinese foundation, but there I have under I have seen that there is a lack of promotion on these programs, and I would really suggest the government to promote more promote these programs more so that

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:37,510
Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Nibra Yunus, currently a secondary four student. Poverty is related to different aspects, but today specifically, I'm here to talk about the education aspect. We all know that education is crucial to alleviation of intergenerational poverty, and also that Chinese provision is a key to ethnic minorities' integration to society.

26
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:57,520
The Education Bureau has implemented different Chinese curriculums in order to help us ethnic minority students to lessen our burden in Chinese learning areas. For example, the General Certificate of Secondary Education of Chinese Language, which is also known as GCSE. Taking myself as an example, I was born in Hong Kong and I studied in Chinese.

27
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:59,840
because let's take an example even if an ethnic minority student gets into university with good results, however it would be hard for him or her to find a job afterwards because in real life situations employers do not look at our qualifications but instead they'll judge us whether we are we are able to speak Chinese fluently and whether we are able.

28
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:31,670
我用咗十幾年攞翻個學位翻嚟嘅，但係如果我生咗個女出嚟，佢去幼稚園都好多問題。幼稚園啲老師同埋幼稚園校長成日都話：呢個學校畀中國人嘅，唔係少數族裔嘅。你仔女識唔識中文？你老婆識唔識中文？咁其實好多問題都係你唔收我點樣學中文咧？咁好啦。

29
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:51,680
你唔收我，我要揾第二啲幼主，我又揾翻少數族嘅同學仔，同我嘅小朋友一齊傾偈。噉佢讀書讀到去中學出嚟啦，都係識講英文、巴基斯坦語言同埋第二啲語言。咁中文係冇exposure嘅。咁呢度可唔可以政府到做多啲監管，同啲幼主？我知我做到嘅，但係應該唔夠。

30
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:11,690
做多啲，等啲幼稚園可以開心啲收我哋啊！佢哋嘅幼稚園入邊畀我啲小朋友讀書啦。另外一樣嘢就係歧視啦。啊，香港嘅歧視不嬲都有嘅，而家人哋唔唔講出嚟啫，但都會做嘅，好in direct。好似銀行開唔到個户口啦，你冇户口收唔到你嘅人工，噉你冇錢㗎啦。

31
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:31,780
咁另外一個問題就係又誒，其實唔係出世就有㗎啦嘛，學出嚟㗎嘛，係邊度學咧？其實喺屋企啦、翻學啦、一般嘅community嗰度學翻嚟嘅。咁呢啲其實可以做咩咧？政府可唔可以同啲幼稚園、小學、中學合作，做多啲誒文化工作坊畀佢哋，等佢本地人？

32
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,590
各位先生，Mr.

33
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,160
We now invite Mr. Basnet Penka, please.

34
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,190
the policies, the welfare policies, and then the second is that.

35
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,090
The lunch scheme has, has they have made any concern about giving the halal food?

36
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:21,390
We can have more pre-talks than before making any policies that we can.

37
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:00,210
出嚟咧，除非嗰個小朋友係精英啦，阿媽阿爸用咗好多心機啦，但係呢啲好少嘅人嚟嘅，係啦，所以政府真係要做多啲咯。

38
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:46,360
the the policies should be disseminated, you know, like properly, and then most of the poverty report showed that the nearly eighty percent of the eighty percent of the community is not aware what's going on, and.

39
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:13,230
所以我的 suggestions last，所以我認為HAD可以也做更多 outreaches 服務在社區，所以你知更多工作在草根，試試找人，找社區領袖，然後試試有 focus group 或 concern group，所以。

40
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:51,790
知道呢班係少數族嘅，佢哋文化唔同，佢哋宗教唔同，唔係話佢哋有問題嘅。噉佢哋一齣曬，唔係一一翻學嗰陣時已經知道係啦。呢班同我哋冇分別，咁起起碼會減低啲歧視啦。咁呢班小朋友，中國小朋友，第時出嚟，如果佢哋要請少數族裔嘅話，或者要同少數族裔一齊做嘢嘅話，佢哋會。

41
00:08:51,790 --> 00:09:11,800
冇咁多偏見或者prejudice對呢班人嘅，咁會令到個社會會開心啲，同埋integrated啲嘅。唔係淨係話少數族羣要學中文，少數族羣學英文嘅，本地人都有一個責任嘅。噉啊，另外一方面我都係覺得歧視嚟嘅。政府咁大嘅部門啦，佢請咗。

42
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:31,810
咁多人啦，好多人英文都唔得掂嘅。噉我哋少數族嘅人去嗰度同佢哋講英文啦，講唔到，噉佢哋會用翻中文同我哋講嘅。咁可唔可以啲醫生啦、護士啦、學校嗰啲老師啦，如果見到一班少數族嘅英文又唔得、中文又唔得嘅，自動actively噉樣揾一啲翻譯翻嚟咧？因

43
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:51,820
好多事少數族嘅，頭先你哋聽到都唔知香港有咩service佢哋可以用，就算知有咩service可以用都唔識得去用嘅。咁啲所有嘅問題咧，令到佢哋生咗下一代出嚟都係loop住個cycle啦，讀唔到書上去啦，揾唔到好嘅工作啦，啱啱好嘅人工啦，咁都係窮嘅。咁點樣可以早出？

44
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:27,450
Hello, good afternoon, respected chairman and respected panel. I'm Kazi. I'm currently studying in the Karatasi Institute of Higher Education and also doing a placement in Unison. So yeah, I would like to point out some few points about the ethnic minority. The the people are not aware of

45
00:10:46,800 --> 00:11:06,810
the there's a there's a very you know like the need in the ethnic minority for the interpretation as well. the interpretation services in the hospital is not working. that we all know and then probably we might think about what we're gonna do and then probably work on it. my suggestion probably maybe if we can have on-site interpretation services would be better. and

46
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:26,820
Another thing, the last point that I would like to make is that about the provision of the free lunch at the schools for the primary students. As we all know, the Committee of the Poverty has just recently in 2014 made that 51.1% is the Pakistani is the highest poverty level. But what it's doing is that the

47
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:54,430
所以，they are they are the highest rate, the Pakistani communities. But they are already left out, but not giving them halal food. So, I don't know how does this work. But I think it would be better if we make a consideration. You know, if we are trying to help this community, then of course the the consideration for the halal food should be made as well.

48
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:41,740
We can try to do that, and then of course the lastly is like we need to do a lot of publicity. Services should be done, you know, and because to initiate the social security welfare system, so more outreach services that I would like to recommend to the government, and then I think HAD can hire some I think minorities.

49
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,300
少嘅困難嘅。

50
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,540
情況，我哋著情睇下可唔可以處理佢啦。

51
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,510
畀佢哋知道中文嘅成績係達到去level幾嘅，咁變咗佢哋喺自己選科嘅時候，其實有困難，因為我唔知自己幾分啊嘛。

52
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:53,580
或maybe have a really concerned group， so that they can go to the community and do more ground work in the grassroots. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Pankar.跟住嚟請陳思琪小姐，唔該。

53
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:51,220
做翻即係可能同翻DSE嘅成績掛鈎嘅，咁譬如話誒GCSE可能太淺啦，但係如果佢考GCA誒GCEA E A level嘅GCE，跟住佢如果攞B嘅話，咁但係嗰個成績嘅換算係幾多咧？咁變咗佢哋冇一個當小數作為學生考大學嘅時候，佢哋冇一個成績。

54
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:32,990
呢個版本咯，咁所以如果對於小數罪類想申請嘅時候，會唔會多翻一啲英文嘅字音，以致佢哋都可以去睇翻咧？即係無論字音同埋申請表都好，都見到係得中文個版本，所以會唔會喺語言呢方面都多翻幾個版本，以致佢哋都可以上網睇翻？唔該，好。

55
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:13,940
係你好，噉我係陳思琪啦。噉我代表自己嚟發言嘅噉，咁一直都有關注翻喺小數族裔權益各方面嘅嘢啦。咁今日就主要想喺誒嗰個資力認可方面就畀啲意見嘅。咁咧都見到其實誒，依家政府都有做到，譬如好似小數族裔啦，喺佢哋自

56
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:33,950
嘅國家可能有呢啲degree學位都好，噉佢哋翻到嚟就可以睇翻究竟喺香港嘅邊一個level噉樣再去做翻一個認可啦。但係其實我哋去即係我哋去問過好多數數眾眾嘅誒嗰啲年輕人都好啦，但係佢都唔係好知依一個嘅認可究竟係咩嚟㗎啦，亦都唔知道係。

57
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:53,960
原來可以申請嘅，咁以致佢哋可以喺香港都可以一個認可去揾工啦。咁另外其實好多誒僱主其實佢都唔係好知道依個即係認可嘅認受性係幾高嘅。就算佢哋攞咗一張有噉樣嘅shot去揾工都好啦，但係其實可能僱主都根本就唔知。

58
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:13,970
係可以等同翻香港嘅學歷嘅，所以喺呢方面會唔會係提供翻多啲宣傳，令僱主同埋資助教育自己都會知呢方面嘅資訊咧？咁同埋另一方面啦，即係我上網睇過一啲誒嗰個過往資歷認可嗰個資助計劃嘅申請指引啊，但係其實我發現好得淨得中文。

59
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:53,280
家陳小姐，跟住我哋請侯斌先生，唔該。多謝主席。誒咁誒，我相信就係誒要講小數族脱貧嘅問題，其實我哋無可避免就要講到教育啦，因為其實即係通過教育先可以促進到佢哋小數族去向上流動嘅，特別係令佢哋接受到一個專上嘅教育。噉我知道其實現時政府。

60
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:13,290
如果係有一啲措施嘅，例如係啊，畀佢哋更大機會接受專上教育啦，就好似你喺錄取非華語學生方面，其實你做咗一啲誒酌情權啦，或者接受其他接受佢哋誒報申報一個其他中文成績。咁但係其實喺誒佢哋入讀大學嘅時候咧，其實因為佢哋語言障礙咧，仍然係面對不。

61
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,030
係呢句説話係咪適用喺佢哋咧？

62
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,430
係啦，都係主席。唔該，阿生。跟住我係請梁樂天先生，唔該。

63
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:09,750
標都唔可以自點樣去自本咧？整規嘅課程規劃都未做，放幾多錢都冇用啦，係咪？第一，所以而家要解決問題係。

64
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:20,610
一般一啲誒中文誒嘅水平係冇提高到嘅，係因為呢個噉嘅架構係冇課程啦、冇指引、冇具體嘅方向，得個架構啫。

65
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:51,540
即係前面好多人，甚甚至上一節啱啱嗰節，即係而家呢一節都好多人講到話學中文嘅重要性。但係我想講，而家嘅教制度根本幫唔到非華語學童去學中文。

66
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:33,440
咁變相咪減低咗佢入讀大學或者報讀佢本來可能夠分入嗰個課程嘅機會咯，係啦。咁所以誒，即係呢三點係一個好實在，究竟而家小數聚喺考大學上面面對嘅問題啦。

67
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:34,680
噉啊，第一樣嘢啦，首先就係嗰個誒計分嘅制度其實唔係好清晰啦。雖然而家就話其實誒大學係接受佢其他嘅中文成績，可能係考G C S C，但係其實嗰個誒大學其實而家嗰個要求咧，淨係擺擺咗一啲最低嘅入學要求，但係其實係冇一個換算嘅標準去誒。

68
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:18,800
我唔我唔知在座嘅官員知唔知大學係點樣收生啦？即係佢即係佢哋唔知自己幾多分嘅時候，佢哋變咗好難揀科。面對揀科嘅時候就變咗個困難啦。咁第二樣嘢就係話，其實而家好多院校咧，佢係做一個case by case嘅，即係可能話誒你啊要個學生遞交咗考試成績，先會再睇下我因應住佢其他成績。

69
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:41,830
咁但係其實呢個係一個好曖昧嘅嘅嘅態度去處理佢㗎嘛，因為其實你視乎個別情況噉，但係冇一個準則或者冇個指引係叫嗰啲院校去點樣去收佢哋嘅時候，咁變相如果真係唔收佢嘅時候，小數對嘅學生又知唔知究竟點解佢哋會唔收咧？係嘛？咁而其他即係各個院校可能亦都冇個指引話。

70
00:16:41,830 --> 00:17:01,840
佢哋知究竟我我我應該因於咩準則去收嗰啲非華裔學生咁喺度嘅時候，其實係欠缺咗一個透明度啦。雖然個著情有彈性嘅，但係同時亦都欠缺咗一個透明度。噉我想知會唔會可能有啲記錄或者啲指引可以畀到誒嗰啲院校去一個清晰嘅指引啦，去防止佢哋啊喺收取非華裔學生嘅時候有一個。

71
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:21,850
誒即係不一嘅情況出現啦。咁第三點好快就係有個面試嘅requirement，其實都唔清晰嘅。而家因為誒，譬如有啲可能係誒用英文作為教學語言嘅課程，但係其實佢需要中文面試嘅。咁但係小數聚嘅同學係佢哋唔知，或者佢到面試嘅時候先知。咁而家佢本身中文都唔係好叻㗎啦。咁但係你又要用中文面試喎，係嘛咁？

72
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:53,730
咁但係其實講到尾咧，誒嗰個其他中文學習誒中文成績嗰Alternative Chinese Qualification咧，其實係一個治標唔治本嘅措施嚟嘅。因為其實誒而家誒鼓勵小六聚去考一啲誒可能GCSE嗰啲噉嘅考試咧，其實係好淺嘅程度，即係可能誒係淺到如果佢就算考。

73
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:13,740
Astar其實佢正常日常溝通或者投身社會工作，亦都係唔足以去應付呢個社會。咁所以即係終極嘅建議，一定係喺誒中學嘅課程睇下可唔可以唔好就係要架構，係要修改成一個係中文作為第二學習語言嘅一個課程，係一個課程畀佢哋學習喺佢哋接受中小學教育嘅時候，可以提供到一個優質嘅學習。

74
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:37,720
係多謝主席。誒噉，我係一個大學生，但係我係一個好關注少數族裔議題嘅大學生。咁其實講到今日貧窮嘅問題咧，我相信一定賴唔開教育嘅問題㗎啦。噉我都係繼續想講翻教方面嘅問題嘅。而家我哋好成日都話咩知識可以改變命運，但係少數族裔嘅學生或者一啲非華裔學童係咪？

75
00:18:51,820 --> 00:19:11,830
我喺呢部分想講一關關於誒學習中文嘅問題啦，同埋講啲補習，即係呢啲非華語學童補習嘅問題嘅。咁講翻少少背景之後先。二零一四年政府去推出一個第二語言架構，係架構啫，唔係課程啊。但係對非華語嘅學童學習中文，即係誒嘅程度啊，或者支援夠唔夠咧？其實佢哋根本。

76
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:40,950
個架構係點咧？就係叫啲誒老師就話啊，我哋第一步係教啲人詞語啦，第二步教啲人句子，第三步教啲人段落就得㗎啦。咁但係其實實際上教啲咩咧？老師根本都唔知嘅，學校係唔識教呢啲非華裔學童點樣學中文，冇內容啦，冇指示畀啲老師嘅，咁導致咧啲誒學童點樣啦？

77
00:19:40,950 --> 00:20:00,960
啊！佢哋喺主流課程嘅時候學中文係聽唔明啦，咁令到佢哋學一啲誒中文教嘅科目嘅時候都聽唔明佢哋講乜嘢嘅。咁點啊？要揾幫人幫手咯。咁第一個肯定揾爸爸媽媽啦，但係爸爸媽媽點啊？佢哋呢啲小熟聚嘅家長好多都有大部分唔識中文啦，或者佢哋英文嘅水平即係可能佢哋唔係識咁多英文嘅。

78
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:20,970
咁未必幫到佢哋啲子女仔女學習啦，噉就要揾補習咯。咁補習係點嘅咧？個解決方法就係畀啲錢一啲大學去營運一啲補習班啦，或者畀啲錢誒畀啲學校做人校本嘅支援啦。咁但係啱啱阿梁國雄議員坐喺度，二零一五年十二月嘅時候，佢喺立法會問過啊，教育局究竟點樣處理呢啲補習班質？

79
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:40,980
數嘅問題啊，噉啊，教育局嘅回覆就係話啊，我哋有定期監察㗎，要去學校誒，即係叫佢提交啲報告啊，去誒學生要填啲問卷啊，去監察翻呢啲噉嘅質素嘅。但係實際情況係點咧？有少數族裔嘅學生話畀我聽，一大班三十幾人，個個坐喺度咁咁點咧？唔係教我哋課本嘅內容，係開個PowerPoint出嚟話我。

80
00:20:40,980 --> 00:21:00,990
講畀佢聽，然之後抄答案就當學咗啦。咁老師嘅當佢識啦。咁但係老師當佢識噉啊，唔理佢啦，噉就O K啦。咁但係其實呢啲噉嘅內容即係點樣監察，我哋都係唔知嘅。咁而家話我哋嘅課程架構唔完善，你就抌一筆錢落去畀啲學校去解決咗呢個問題，去靠校本去支援去解決呢啲問題。但係呢個方法連

81
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:30,040
貧窮問題要有教育嘅手，點樣入手啊？係你嘅教育課程唔係我，淨要唔係淨要一個架構，我要一個真真正正嘅課程，要有教材、有內容，去畀啲老師點樣去教我哋呢啲華非華裔學生。但係當務之急係要監管翻呢啲補習班嘅質素，等佢哋有一個適時嘅支援。要注意翻，我唔係要畀一啲壓力，前線誒一啲嘅老師。

82
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:50,050
誒誒，同埋誒一啲誒教學嘅人員，但係一啲公開檢討報告啊，但係誒學誒教育局可唔可以誒補翻翻畀我哋咧？又或者可唔可以補翻啲professional training畀一啲誒教師去等佢哋識去教一啲誒非華語學童點樣去補習咧？唔該曬，多謝梁生。跟住我哋請麥朗維先生，唔該。係。

83
00:21:50,050 --> 00:22:10,060
多謝主席。咁如果講到話脱貧呢一樣嘢，其實我自己作為一啲大學生，自己最關注嘅當然即係脱貧最重要都係第時份工㗎啦。咁其實除咗頭先講話教育中文教育嘅重要性之外，其實更重要嘅係出到嚟工作嘅時候，你所學到嘅中文究竟有冇幫助到你喺職場上面嘅用運作啊嘛？但係其實今

84
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:30,070
今日政府要關注嘅唔單止係除咗佢哋喺中小學、喺大學嘅中文學習，其實連成人嘅中文培訓都非常之重要。其實現時雖然有好多嘅行業聽落去係唔需要中文，但係其實咧去到現實嘅情況底下咧，呢啲行業咧係仍然會吸走一啲唔識得中文嘅人嘅。例如喺我自己誒見過嘅一啲個。

85
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:50,080
案啦，例如有啲喺外國讀完法律嘅翻到嚟嘅法律精英，其實喺律師樓都係揾唔到工作做嘅。跟住之後，例如亦都有聽到一啲更加好笑嘅一啲個案，就係連清潔工人都會因為佢唔識得睇一啲清潔劑上面嘅中文標籤，所以就用一個噉樣嘅藉口，所以就唔請佢哋啦。咁其實現時呢一個清。

86
00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:10,090
情況當然，政府係好難去完全去清除呢啲噉嘅情況啦。但係現時中文能力去到最尾都係成為咗少數族裔向上流嘅最大阻滯。即使現時有好多土生土長嘅少數族裔已經識得聽講廣東話啦，但係中文嘅讀寫能力一直都係追唔上誒中誒香港嘅華人。

87
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:30,280
其實現時已經有不少嘅公司咧，開始咧會抽取一啲嘅誒，開始制定一啲嘅嘅嘅課程啦，誒，去畀呢啲嘅小數聚去參加嘅。例如現時有一啲公司咧，會抽取小數聚嘅工作時間，鼓勵佢哋參加一啲例如E.R.B.或者其他嘅中文課程，令到佢哋可以。

88
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:50,290
學習喺職場上面需要嘅中文，而偏偏呢啲肯為少數族裔裝備自己中文能力嘅公司，其實真係少之又少。佢哋呢啲少數族裔，既然又冇辦法去裝備自己中文能力，試問佢又點可以喺香港嘅職場裏面可以向上流咧？佢最終根本就冇辦法解決佢佢哋嘅跨代貧窮嘅問題。現

89
00:23:50,290 --> 00:24:10,300
如果政府真係想要解決少數族裔嘅貧窮問題嘅話，就先就唔好再將中文嘅責任推畀少數族裔去自己解決。其實現時有好多畀少數族裔嘅成年修讀嘅中文課程，除咗頭先我所講嘅E.L.B.之外，例如民政署嘅少數族裔服務中心，或者好多嘅N.G.O.或者其他support centre，其實已經揾。

90
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:30,310
揾到好多嘅課程去畀一啲成年人去參加，但係唔同嘅機構之間佢哋冇協調，中文班嘅程度亦都不一。呢啲少數族裔如果佢哋想參加，亦都唔知道自己應該去報邊啲嘅課程嘅時候，咁其實政府可唔可以考慮下透過勞工署去推出一啲嘅設施或者一啲措施啊，去鼓勵一啲公司？

91
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,760
The teacher did not let me in.

92
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,140
我哋 now invite Mrs Abia to to follow, please.

93
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,540
工作最後咧就係一個住屋嘅困難，現現時有七十七。

94
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:17,350
is not very helpful for them if they cannot read and write because these are the requirements of the employer.

95
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:20,560
admission in Chinese mainstream kindergarten. I have applied in two best kindergartens among my area, but my observation is they do not accept any ethnic minorities.

96
00:26:50,380 --> 00:27:01,490
咧都奉行男主外女主內嘅一個社會嘅規範，好多少數族裔嘅女性咧都係唔會投入呢個勞工市場，令到佢哋嘅家庭收入咧係有限。

97
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:49,610
Employers should also provide on-job language course training with recognition to create a win-win situation for both parties. For those who are already fluent in spoken and listening, should be given more value and recognition for many jobs.

98
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:36,260
language classes from NGOs or other institutions are not recognised by employer and their quality is really low. There should be a standard course which also be accepted by employer. It should have benchmark among the current Chinese courses provided by ERB, HAD support centres, NGOs institutions etc.

99
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:50,320
去畀小組做嘢，用上班嘅時間去進修佢哋嘅中文咧，噉樣先可以真真正正令到佢哋裝備翻佢哋嘅中文能力。噉樣先可以佢哋喺佢哋嘅職場裏面可以生存得到。噉樣先係解決貧窮嘅方法。多謝唔該，麥三跟住嚟請公民黨嘅餘德寶先生。誒，多謝我係誒油尖旺嘅區員，亦都係。

100
00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:10,330
民族誒民族小組工作小組嘅成員，目前南亞裔人士係香港少數族裔中最大羣族，亦都係最貧窮嘅一羣。誒，根據二零一五年政府公佈嘅《香港少數族裔貧窮情況報告》，指出巴基斯坦等人嘅貧窮率比其他少數族裔較為高。公民黨認為現時少數族裔

101
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:30,340
就係冇一個統一同埋整合多元文化政策，去協助本身應落後喺起跑線上嘅少數族裔，同埋佢哋下一代嘅人誒融入主流嘅社會，令到佢哋無法向上移動，更遑論去脱貧。公民黨認為少數族裔嘅貧窮問題係會影響到佢以下幾。

102
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:50,350
方面嘅生活質素，而呢啲生活質素亦都會影響到佢哋，加劇佢哋嘅貧窮問題，情況係令人憂慮。蘇族瑞誒佢哋教育無助脱貧，誒蘇族瑞喺學習中文嘅時候，亦都冇得到充足嘅支援，令到佢哋嘅中文水平同一般嘅學生咧係相距甚遠，難以達到本地大。

103
00:25:50,350 --> 00:26:10,360
學嘅中文成績嘅要求，香港大部分主流學校都係以中文為主要嘅教授語言。誒，有啲學童因為家庭成員比較多啊，佢哋要課誒喺課餘嘅工作嘅誒課餘嘅時候咧，都要幫補家計。咁唔單止係會影響到佢佢哋嘅學業啦，而家成為咗香港教育制度嘅犧牲品。所以我哋公民黨都建議。

104
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:30,370
以盡快去落實中文作為第二語言嘅課程指引同埋教誒考評嘅準則，亦都要全面去檢討為小數逐句定立一個中文課程嘅誒誒嘅課程啦，令到佢哋更加有效咁去學習中文。另外就係求職，亦都係會遇到困難。報告亦都指出中文課程。

105
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:50,380
欠佳咧，誒中文課程欠佳咧，亦都令到佢哋成為咗僱主拒絕去聘請佢哋嘅原因。而家勞工處咧誒嘅集集中心提供嘅就業資訊咧，大部分都以中文去表示，令到好多誒小業族裔都無所適從，佢哋只能夠靠佢哋嘅人際網絡啦去揾工作。但係由於好多小業族裔，

106
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:21,780
誒，因此咧，我哋要求勞工署必須要提誒增加呢個資源同埋增聘呢個人手，去製造多元文化嘅環境。同時咧，都促誒促請政府咧係增加撥款去支援一啲社企啊，以一啲誒part time一隻兼職嘅形式咧，去聘請少數族裔嘅婦女，令到佢哋都可以安心工。

107
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:46,890
誒七十七點九嘅percent嘅小六族裔咧，係住緊私人嘅樓宇，而佢哋大部分咧都係以一個租嘅誒租租住嘅為主啦。喺市場上有好多業主係唔願意係去租借畀呢小六族裔，變相係減少咗佢哋喺誒住屋上嘅選擇。同時咧，大部分嘅小六族裔喺申請公屋嘅時，

108
00:27:46,890 --> 00:28:06,900
咧都同樣面對好多誒言語上嘅困難，而錯失一啲配誒配獲公屋嘅機會。所以我哋希望咧，政府可以誒考慮我哋以上嘅一啲建議啦，令到所有族裔嘅朋友咧都可以喺同一個起跑線上得到公平嘅待遇，可以可以得到向上流動嘅機會。多謝主席，跟住餘生。

109
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:31,430
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Abir. I have worked in an NGO before and now stay home to take care of my daughter. Sir, in Hong Kong, we have to address two groups of ethnic minorities who are new arrivals and second ones are born and raised in here. I came to Hong Kong ten years back, so yes, I do not speak a local language. But the kids, youths, I meet in schools and universities.

110
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:51,440
Are as fluent as locals, but unfortunately, they are still not progressing as they should be because the hurdle of reading and writing Cantonese still stands. No matter how fluent they are and how hard they try, they are still not being able to compete with locals in different fields. The question is why? In school, they are taught very easy level Cantonese in which they can easily learn conversations.

111
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:11,450
But only few words in reading and writing. A new arrival is also able to pass GCSE level in two years' time, and the same curriculum is taught to kids who are studying here since kindergarten, which is unfair, unjustified for these students who could easily get better in Cantonese with extra support of schools. These learn spoken Cantonese coming from ethnic minority.

112
00:29:49,890 --> 00:30:09,900
My other fellow members have spoken or will speak about flaws in education system and employment, so I don't have to repeat that. All I want is to make a humble request to please take us into deep consideration, as we are kids and our future generation are as much as future of Hong Kong as local Chinese are. Sir, on the other note, my daughter going to kindergarten this year has not got.

113
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,370
Thank you, Mrs. de Waal.

114
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,710
係。好，唔該曬，Miss石吧。

115
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,440
We now invite Mrs. Shibana Akbar, please.

116
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:54,510
But now she's going to going to be in English kindergarten. So who is responsible for that? Because I applied in two best kindergartens in in my district. Thank you, sir.

117
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:44,050
My question to EDB is, why, if I can speak enough English to communicate with anybody, why teachers cannot cannot cater my need? I do not speak Chinese, that's true, but I speak enough English to talk to the teacher and my kid. If she goes to Chinese kindergarten, she will learn more Chinese.

118
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:20,740
係，大家好，我叫Shabana，噉我就喺誒小學過嚟香港啦。咁其實我阿爸喺一九六五年已經喺度啦。咁即係其實我哋小學做嘅已經已經都有好耐歷史喺度啦。咁講翻少少我個background啦。咁其實我喺呢度長大，咁以前都係得個誒一兩間收我哋。

119
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:40,750
嚟㗎啦，咁咁嗰啲叫做指定學校啦。噉我喺嗰度讀完書出嚟啦。咁嗰陣時咧就冇得冇得學中文嘅。噉我個中文咧其實係靠電視學同埋自己努力學嘅。咁但係咧就讀完書之後出嚟社會先知道原來中文係好重要嘅，因為已經迴歸咗啦嘛。咁乜都係中文，我想進修都係要。

120
00:31:40,750 --> 00:32:00,760
識中文，我想求職都係要中文，基本嗰啲文職乜都係要中文。我根本係好多嘢都做唔到。我嗰陣時覺得哇，噉啊真係誒！我哋我哋咪好似畀人笨，乜都唔識嘅中文。依家我成日我我雖然講得O K啦，都溝通到，但係都遇到好多問題。咁當我

121
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:20,770
誒屋企我哥就生咗個女，噉我就覺得好啦。我經歷過呢個system啦，呢個education system教育制度已經係對我哋對啲小數族裔嘅，即係好多嘢都係好好唔理想。噉我就堅持佢哋讀翻誒主流嘅幼稚園跟住小學啦。咁誒。

122
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:40,780
誒右轉嗰陣時咧就O K啦，就個三年個我個侄女都學到中文講到，但係咧原來佢寫讀係好多問題嘅。咁到佢升小一嘅時候咧，咁其實揀學校已經係好大問題啦。就好似頭先邊位講嘅話，好多資料都係中文㗎嘛，就算啲小學都係啦。

123
00:32:40,780 --> 00:33:00,790
除非E.M.I.嗰啲咁嗰啲好難入㗎啦，係咪噉我哋梗係揀啲中文㗎啦。噉我哋又好想學中文好啲，噉啊揀翻誒中主流嘅中文學校。咁入到去咧，小一嘅時候遇到好多問題，個老師根本係冇一個敏感度啊。佢覺得其實係個女係難，即係佢好懶。

124
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:20,800
佢唔識中文，佢啲人講係其實得個六歲個小朋友，佢已經已經已經有消弱殘咗，已經誒覺得佢係level咗係一個唔會學到中文，誒佢已經係失敗㗎啦啊！繼續落去佢唔會得㗎啦啊！噉你不如轉下誒第二間學校啦，可能指定校啦會輕鬆啲啊，有黑黑白白。

125
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:40,810
啊，好啲㗎！呢度係華人社會。誒，你可能可能學嘅嘢係好好好難啊，跟唔到。噉我知道呢個係華人社會，我我哋相信香港係華人社會，但係始終都有my natures㗎嘛。譬如我個阿爸一六一九六五落嚟㗎嘛，咁咁衰俗族就一直都有㗎嘛。咁每個國家都有衰俗族類。

126
00:33:40,810 --> 00:34:00,820
㗎啦，咁但係我覺得啲老師可以噉樣講，就根本係冇一啲敏感度，冇每一個每一個成世出嚟時覺得，即係我哋都係人，噉我哋都係想學嘢嘅啫，咁做老師都係要教好。咁點知我都係唔，我都係堅持唔想轉校㗎啦。我覺得其實嚇仲話個女係可能有問題，佢可能係疏。

127
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:20,830
啦，又呢樣嗰樣，總之好多嘢啦。總之叫我哋走啦，噉我就唔想走嘅。咁點知佢就誒，我堅持啦。之後我誒都覺得好多問題，因為其實我覺得去翻指定學校咧，個問題依然存在嘅。其實即係小學教育個個問題係教育開始咯。如果教

128
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:40,840
又可以做得好啲，有個第二樣嘅基誒架構啦，中文第二樣嘅架構啦。噉我哋就算唔好學，唔好話去大學啊，嗰啲誒ivy啊，vocational study。咁如果係中文好啲，噉我哋都可以學翻嗰啲。咁對社會有貢獻，咁大家一齊可以做好啲，有多啲challenge都唔係好壞嘅啫。

129
00:34:43,990 --> 00:35:04,000
誒，跟住我哋請醫護行者嘅劉海寧小姐，唔該，係多謝主席。咁誒，我哋今日講少數族裔嘅貧窮議題啦。咁頭先或者上個月個會，其實都講咗好多就業同埋教育嘅一啲面向嘅。噉我哋作為醫護行者咧，想加多一個都好重要嘅面向喺脱貧或者扶貧上，其實健康都係重要嘅，因為我哋想帶。

130
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:24,010
帶出其實貧窮同疾病係有個惡性循環啦。誒，我哋啲數字都顯出，其實我哋香港南亞裔家庭咧個家庭人數好大，但係其實工作人數相對嚟少嘅。咁當呢一個breadwinner佢係病咗啦，又或者有工傷嘅時候咧，如果佢唔能夠工作去維生，其實好容易呢個家庭就會跌落貧窮線。咁所以其實喺疾病。

131
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:44,020
喺呢個層面或者健康管理咧，係非常重要嘅。噉我哋今日想帶出三個嘅誒指點啦。咁第一個係咪見到勞工處嘅代表都喺度，就想講下關於都係數字嗰樣嘢嘅data嘅重要性啦。咁其實勞工處好有趣嘅喺誒職業病或者職業死亡上咧，係有收一啲小數據嘅嘅資料嘅。噉係。

132
00:35:44,020 --> 00:36:04,030
喺職業死亡啦，同埋工業意外死亡上咧係有分誒華人啦，同埋少數族嘅數字。但係好有趣咧，喺職業受傷或者工業意外受傷誒，而呢一個數字相對地人數係多好多嘅，就冇分少數族定華裔啦。噉我哋希望咧勞工處都可以考慮，可以誒可以攞翻呢個數字啦，因為係巴基斯坦嚟講咧。

133
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:24,040
誒巴基斯坦又有大概十七個percent咧嘅人係做一啲從事高危嘅工作，例如係建築業啦或者運輸。咁相對我哋整體嘅population咧就八percent。咁假如我哋一啲職業受傷、職業意外嘅數字反映到，可能小數聚係較低嘅。咁會唔會其實反映其實係一個誒reporting報導係少咗咧？

134
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:44,050
咧或者佢哋知唔知其實原來工商係要報嘅咧？咁如果反映出嚟數字係高嘅，其實代表我哋有更多工作做。咁所以其實呢個數字咧，我哋認為係好重要嘅。咁另一個議題都想帶出嘅，誒第二樣嘢就係關於減少少數族裔，特別係從事高危職業少數族裔受傷嘅機會。咁其實職安局咧都有印。

135
00:36:44,050 --> 00:37:04,060
係一啲嘅誒資料啦，係用小數聚語言嘅。但係我哋喺個simulation都有寫，其實有個誒研究都show到咧，有六成嘅小數聚語咧，其實係唔知道，亦都冇見過呢一啲嘅資料啦。噉啊，預防係重要嘅，咁所以都可以建議下當局咧，勞工處、職安局喺制定一啲誒教育或者職安健嘅知識嘅時，

136
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:24,070
後咧，除咗係印製資料，其實可以考慮啱啱都有。前面有先生講啦，做多一啲外展嘅服務outreach，係有埋一啲一翻嘅權喺度嘅，因為呢一個咧對小數聚類嚟講咧係較合適嘅。咁第三個點啦，都好重要嘅，就係假如小數聚真係受咗傷，有工傷或者疾病、職業病之後咧，其實要有一個好好嘅誒復康。

137
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:44,080
嘅支援啦，佢哋先能夠從頭呢個誒勞工嘅市場去可以有翻個收入嘅。咁喺呢個層面咧，有有兩嘢我哋想講嘅。第一個係都好多誒一啲研究顯示，其實少數族裔咧對於一啲僱員補償嘅條例係唔認識嘅。可能佢哋有工傷咧，其實唔知道原來佢哋係可以攞翻個合理嘅補償啦。咁呢個係第一。

138
00:37:44,080 --> 00:38:04,090
啦，第二點咧就係關於一啲復康嘅服務啦，例如係誒職業治療啦、物理治療啦，甚至乎係精神健康。其實呢一啲服務，我哋前線聽翻嚟好多case咧，佢哋係唔知道係有interpretation service嘅。咁所以呢一個咧，可能就再橫觀少少，就想提出其實當一個少數族裔佢喺唔同嘅部門，可能入咗去個case。

139
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:24,100
力係工商，佢跟住有好多嘢會有一啲轉介嘅，可能係去啲復康服務啊，或者精神科服務，會唔會係可以有一個跨部門嘅轉介嘅時候，可以增設一個語言嘅需要咧？因為小數聚嚟咗勞工處需要翻譯，其實佢喺醫管局一樣需要翻譯嘅，而呢一個語言嘅需要咧，似乎暫時咧每個部門咧都係分隔嘅，咁所以我哋都建議會唔會可以。

140
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:44,110
有個跨部門嘅轉介就可以做翻呢個跟進嘅。多謝小姐。唔該，劉小姐。We now invite Ms. Bujarkapai Piyami, please. Thank you, Chairman. The administration's recent efforts at seeking to understand poverty situation of ethnic minorities is most welcome, as the findings reveal there are distinct issues which cut across ethnic groups and intra-ethnic.

141
00:38:44,110 --> 00:39:04,120
社區， as well. So the complexity of the issues that impact this group and the distinctions cannot be ignored. The administration's progress in disaggregating the data by these variables is an indicator that such a complex approach to solutions to poverty is also similarly required. Whilst the administration reports that recent poverty alleviation

142
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:33,330
五或六pm，所以我會suggest that the time should be revised and more be more convenient to the working hours of the employment.

143
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:42,130
There are some circumstances which can explain some of these figures in the form of language exclusion, but these matters are further exacerbated by the environment that we have in Hong Kong, where there is now an increasing tendency towards exclusion and marginalisation, given the societal rhetoric against ethnic minorities.

144
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:21,240
什麼意思？什麼

145
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:24,130
措施 have helped mitigate the circumstances faced by ethnic minorities. The approach does not foreshadow any long-term plan to address the causative factors on a systemic basis to help prevent intergenerational poverty and entrenchment. The paper proposes that the lack of Chinese language skills poses the significant or the most significant barrier and linked to poverty.

146
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:44,140
However, the picture is far more complex than this. The lack of attention to specific causative factors for poverty among minority groups suggests the inherent limitations to the extent of the success and the sustainability of existing poverty alleviation measures for this group. The data clearly reflects systemic and institutionalised discrimination against Hong Kong's ethnic minorities.

147
00:39:44,140 --> 00:40:04,150
which suggests that it's not simply a function of language exclusion in Hong Kong, but rather poverty is largely characterised by the colour of one's skin and the absence of any rigorous implementation of equality rights under the race discrimination ordinance. The figures are quite stark in the report, and I won't repeat them except to show that in every sphere of life, ethnic minority.

148
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:24,160
Underperform or are underrepresented, whether it is our levels of poverty compared with the overall population, or our representation in the workforce, the professions we occupy, our household incomes, and the gaps are particularly stark if you break it down further by gender and by age. So

149
00:40:42,410 --> 00:41:02,420
The problem of child poverty is also very serious. One third of ethnic minority children live in situations of poverty, and nearly a quarter of all youth aged 15 to 24 live in situations of poverty. The figures highlight precisely why we can't apply generalised policies for poverty eradication across the board. For a systemic problem, we need a creative solution.

150
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:22,730
第一和最 urgent 接近是 to conduct a comprehensive review to examine the causative factors so that we can track groups before they fall into situations of intergenerational poverty. This is this requires understanding the link between childhood and poverty trends. Other jurisdictions have studies about success sequences for different ethnic groups and what determine

151
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:42,740
The at-risk factors for people ending up in situations of poverty. I also suggest a multidisciplinary task force begin conducting an impact assessment and evaluation of our legal and policy measures targeting ethnic minorities. And to address the problem, I also recommend a high-level commission to look at ethnic minority affairs as a whole. This information.

152
00:41:42,740 --> 00:42:02,750
needs to be made available to a single body who can comprehensively assess the impact from a macro perspective, not just the micro-level issues, because all of these issues are significantly interrelated. All the deputations point to the fact that there is significant discrimination prevalent across society in different spheres in Hong Kong. Language does not address these other prejudices.

153
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:41,530
Good afternoon. My name is Bushra and I have been living in Hong Kong for more than seven years. I have been working after that. And considering today's topic poverty, I would like to focus on one of the reason which is usually addressed. It is participation of EVM men in the Hong Kong and their

154
00:42:41,530 --> 00:43:01,540
limitation. They are not taking part in labour force. First of all, I want to emphasise that it is not the culture which is limiting EM women to work in Hong Kong. It is wholly their own preference. It could be because of their commitment with family and their children. And ladies.

155
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:21,550
Like for the children, their school their school finish at three thirty, and most most of the time it in the year, and sometime it finish at twelve o'clock or in the morning or eleven o'clock, and sometimes other than public holidays, there are day offs.

156
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:41,560
and it is unable, it is not convenient for ladies to take up any appointment employment when they are working full time or part time when they have to take care of their children. and along with that, if we talk about the

157
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,150
咩？啱啱。

158
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,100
Thank you very much.

159
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,810
薩拉馬勒庫姆，謝謝。

160
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,350
喺香港，我係大概二廿幾年。

161
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:02,460
我 had only one job， so it was very difficult for me to meet all these expenses.

162
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:45,740
但係，我唔知點解我會去到呢度。

163
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:55,530
我喺嗰陣時喺香港，我係一個人住。我係一個人住，因為我喺香港，我係一個人住。

164
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:37,660
我知，我知，我知。

165
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:43,400
我我喺香港，我大概五廿幾年都喺度住。我喺香港住咗廿幾年。我喺香港住咗

166
00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:13,470
EM can participate in that employment opportunity and more flexible hours job should be introduced for part-time worker ladies who want to do part-time jobs. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Kallek. We now invite Mr. Mohammed Khatir, please.

167
00:43:41,560 --> 00:44:01,570
childcare service centres which are provided by government after-school services and they are not available for they are only available for limited parents and private childcare service centres they are very

168
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:21,580
expensive， and when we talk about neighbourhood childcare service centres, their timings are not convenient for the ladies who want to work. Like their their time starts from nine o'clock and which is the usual time for the employment and finish around six to.

169
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:54,020
And along with that, I want to discuss that here. I want the information about childcare service centres. It is not available. Most of them, like I being a single parent, I could only get this information because I am educated. I explored it.

170
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:14,150
and by by other ladies I have encountered with they really don't know about this information and if they get this information this maybe in in Chinese is not available in English and I would suggest to provide childcare service support to ladies who really.

171
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:34,160
Want to work and so it will encourage them to go out and they are really satisfied with their children care. And one more thing that they should understand that we should we should understand the woman need.

172
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:54,170
how they want to in which area they want to work and how they comfortable they can work in a certain environment and according to that more vacancies can be opened and like in childcare neighbourhood service centres they provide carers at home and.

173
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:15,820
B B.兒童嘅家屬，難以接受。Because I didn't have a good job, so I was not able to take my wife and children to live with me. 我嘅年華比較慘，啲，喺㗎間房間內，afford唔到。幾年嘅年頭，我做咗兩份工，將我嘅老婆同小朋友喺呢度。

174
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:35,830
sponsor.我我的 salary was very low, so I cannot afford a separate flat. And a few years back, I do two jobs to sponsor my wife and children. 我係另揀一間，但係佢嘅租金好高，要供緊屋，又要供緊

175
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:55,840
都減。我係我

176
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,430
誒。

177
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,910
我哋要幫佢哋。

178
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,120
佢哋啲嘢，就係我哋嘅。

179
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,800
這中心呢，我係所有嘅方案apply，做嘅啲。And this centre help me to apply for these schemes.

180
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:54,910
centre倉頡，和這 centre 也告訴我關於不同其他方案，如教科書援助方案為兒童。

181
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:29,890
香港買工職唔係好唔易，我試過幾次都唔得。

182
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:16,550
和或，on所有方案嘅正確promotion，做。And government should provide interpretation services in all departments and form filling services and promote these schemes appropriately.

183
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:25,330
我很多年，以呢啲嚟，幾年我識咗啲人，我識

184
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:44,210
啲 centre 們就幫我申請咗啲其他嘅方案。

185
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:40,520
still，it is difficult to afford all this，but after getting help from these assistance schemes，it is better than before。如果政府我們的家鄉的窮困拿出來，所以

186
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:22,790
我政府 مختلف امدادو کیسکیمو کے بالکل معلوم نہیں تھا. I didn't know, I didn't have any information about different assistance schemes by the government. میں وقت میں کمرشیلی فیڈ یوماتیس اونہ کتابوں کی کیمے لیبر ڈپارٹمنٹ کرائے کی کیمے تھی.

187
00:48:46,020 --> 00:49:06,030
我覺得語言唔係問題，問題係我唔識點樣寫。

188
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:22,170
因為增加幫助，我得到幫助後，我帶我的孩子來。After getting help from this centre, I I take my children to live with me. 現在雖然很困難，但他們的數量和我的類似的人會得到很多幫助。

189
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,930
係呢個問題。

190
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,560
唔同嘅問題。

191
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,120
超過一半嘅人都係。

192
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,450
係呢個貧窮線以下嘅。

193
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,000
Thank you, Mr. Guadian. Thank you, Mr. Chan.

194
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,110
誒，跟住我哋請阿何宏達先生，唔該。

195
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,420
which provide jobs to us according to our qualifications.

196
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:16,000
這將不單止離窮困遠，而且按你的能力，你會得到一份工作。

197
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:02,880
部門應該做一個特定的 Division for us，就我們的國別據此而找工作。

198
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:45,190
with this help we will be economically better and we will we will be able to give better future to our childrens. thank you very much.

199
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:51,130
喺數字上已經好好清晰咁睇到小數族羣所面對嘅貧窮議題係非常嚴重，佢哋需要好多嘅政策嘅介入同埋支援，但係喺

200
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:34,970
Ali improve the workforce, but we will also get jobs according to our abilities。或藉此嘅因為，我們經濟上或比較堅固，堅固，或做嘅，或

201
00:50:40,800 --> 00:51:00,810
If government want families like us to get rid of poverty, they should help us to apply for those assistance schemes. 或阿爾麥麥咪，打字機嘅手續發明，做嘅法文，

202
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:50,180
那啲工作喺中文入面寫住，我用英文同佢講，佢就話係中文。

203
00:51:50,180 --> 00:52:10,190
我講話，

204
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:33,470
之後，我問他：，我問他，我

205
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:53,480
政府如果真係想幫我們，想減輕貧窮， labour department，我們要為政府做啲咩？

206
00:53:52,870 --> 00:54:12,880
主席，我係一個關注少數族嘅權益嘅社工學生。喺討論少數族嘅權益嘅時候，喺討論呢個貧窮問題嘅時候，我認為唔可以只能去以一個本地華人嘅角度去睇呢個貧窮嘅議題，而係需要從一個少數族嘅獨特嘅需要去。

207
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,120
係。

208
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,380
能力嘅誒。

209
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,070
就業最大嘅障礙。

210
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,780
所以我哋認為勞工處喺。

211
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,440
誒限制，誒舉一個實例去引證我頭先所講嘅一個例子。

212
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:53,920
呢個情況係好應該去正視少數族裔喺求職時所遇到嘅歧視問題。

213
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:26,590
僱主只係列出同工作相關嘅能力要求，並盡快。

214
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:08,030
唔不禁，但係已經不禁令人懷疑，行政長官所講嘅就業支援有冇？

215
00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:01,650
上述所提到嘅問題，只係少數族裔喺求職上、就業上遇到嘅一小部分問題。

216
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:43,810
Thank you, Chairman, and I thank the subcommittee for considering this very important topic, and the members of the administration who have attended today.

217
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:35,980
增設呢個小數族嘅就業科，多謝。係唔該，學生，我先現場會議到五點十五分先啦。誒，We now invite Mr. Azan Nawwah, please.

218
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:20,380
cover有冇覆蓋到呢個少數族裔嘅需要咧？故此，我哋建議勞工處去遊增加遊説僱主去聘請少數族裔，亦都鼓勵。

219
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:44,000
嗰邊嘅負責人就表示啊，我哋需要一啲讀寫嘅中文，同埋我哋需要一啲電腦嘅技巧。呢樣嘢其實著實係刁難嘅一啲少數族裔去揾一份適合佢哋嘅工作，令佢哋冇得去攞到呢份嘅工作之餘，呢個僱主亦都唔需要負上呢個責任。

220
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:34,250
貧窮問題喺少數族嘅南亞族羣等嘅議題係特別嚴重嘅。根據扶貧委員會喺二零一四年嘅報告指出，南亞裔嘅住户貧窮率高達三十點八percent，而失業率亦都有十六點六percent。其中以巴基斯坦裔最為嚴重，係。

221
00:54:51,410 --> 00:55:11,420
二零零三年行政長官林鄭月娥曾經喺呢個扶貧委員會高峯會提到，最重要、最有效嘅扶貧或者脱貧嘅工作就係就業，所以我哋喺就業或援助嘅方面亦都應該繼續去做有關嘅事。但係我哋喺而家仍然見到少數族裔喺就業方面遇到好多。

222
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:33,270
小數族裔喺求職嘅時候會遇到好多唔公平嘅對待，例如喺一啲低技術嘅工作，其實佢哋會要求僱主會要求呢啲小數族裔係識得去讀寫中文，對佢哋嚟講係設立篳咗一個好高嘅求職門檻。呢啲語言障礙對一啲南亞族羣嚟講係佢哋。

223
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:55,750
相對比本地華人嚟講，即使佢哋唔識寫得唔識讀寫中文嚟，但係因為佢哋係華人，僱主對佢哋嘅要求亦都冇咁高。但係因為我哋嘅求職者喺啲少數族裔嘅時候，一某一啲僱主會因應佢哋嘅種族而增加唔同嘅要求或者能。

224
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:23,730
誒，我曾經喺勞工處入面揾到一份保安嘅工作。咁呢份工作本來冇提到任何嘅能力要求，亦都冇講過任何嘅語言要求。但係當我為一個少數族裔嘅求職者致電呢個僱主去詢問有關工作嘅時候，當我表明呢個求職者係一個少數族裔。

225
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,580
minorities to those criteria.

226
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,740
政府可以fix呢個。

227
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:29,030
歧見揀

228
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:38,160
我問你，how would you feel if every time you met a stranger, they asked you where are you really from?

229
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:47,630
如果你想知道什麼意思，什麼是wrong with the problem with the situation，我 just ask you to look around you.

230
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:57,010
bureau should be made accountable to monitor and report and increase ethnic minority representation.

231
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:46,830
我們 feel as though we are alienated and powerless to do anything about this problem, because we are not represented.

232
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:12,850
社會，那後代的那些士兵，即使他們，即使我們的貢獻，遭受不合理的貧窮，今天。

233
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:23,260
可憐，的行政紙張並未提及如何對抗貧窮的根源。特別是，行政失敗，不承認廣泛的歧視問題。

234
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:40,530
政府必須address the root of the problem，which is the pervasive portrayal of Hong Kong as a mono-ethnic city led by a majority， with a transient foreigner community.

235
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:15,130
我 ask the subcommittee to have a look to the left. How many ethnic minority representatives in the government are there today? What language have they chosen to speak to us today?

236
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:31,540
我認為那説得自明。無怪乎族裔少數者經常被稱為外來者，即使像我一樣，他們可能在香港出生，可能在香港長大，但我們從來不被視為本地人或本地居民。

237
00:58:48,170 --> 00:59:03,750
There are no ethnic minority legislators. There are no ethnic minority principal officials. There are no ethnic minority members of Exco. There are no ethnic minority district councillors. Minorities are almost entirely unrepresented in government appointment boards.

238
00:57:44,490 --> 00:58:04,500
香港應該為不 disproportionate貢獻於我們經濟、文化、運動、治理和社會的非華人而驕傲。我們是香港的金線。亞洲委員會無疑會記住南亞律師在第二次世界大戰中為香港奮鬥的貢獻。真可憐。

239
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:17,340
They should, when forming search committees for jobs, they should include ethnic minorities on those committees. They should be required to include ethnic minorities in candidate shortlists, and where this is not possible because no minorities are qualified, committees should be required to report and examine criteria and to improve access to opportunities for.

240
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:39,960
第二，ly， the government must take a more proactive approach to enforcing the problem of discriminatory treatment. I regularly receive and advise on complaints, for example, about estate agents and landlords openly demanding to know the race of proposed tenants, refusing to rent to ethnic minorities or requiring higher

241
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,780
你嘅咩話？

242
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,470
政府代表有冇咩需要扼要喺呢個階段啊，或者？

243
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:56,960
The relevant law enforcement divisions of the government are not properly empowered to do much about this.

244
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:48,330
rents and deposits from ethnic minorities. This is a gateway problem, but it demonstrates the reality. Regrettably.

245
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:28,880
should take an active role in engaging in undercover operations to expose these practices and properly enforce the law. I thank the subcommittee for its attention.

246
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:14,400
想講下啦，咁誒有啲誒朋友亦都提到有啲關於教育個架構同埋課程嘅問題，我都即係請阿葉小姐可以好簡單回應啦。亦都有啲勞工處關於嗰啲勞工法例嘅保障咧，我諗啊，阿勞工處阿許先生可以好簡單講一講啦嚇。好，可能請葉先生要少少講啦，唔該。

247
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:17,250
The Equal Opportunities Commission should be given greater investigative and enforcement powers. The estate agents' authority should be funded and authorised to combat discrimination by or assisted by estate agents. Housing discrimination based on race should become a criminal offence, and law enforcement should not focus on reacting to complaints but

248
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:51,270
誒喺我哋或者邀請誒政府代表啊，或者扼要咁歸納咗，或者誒總結之前咧，我需要徵求大家意見，因為而家時間上我哋係比較完定嘅時間係遲咗都唔少㗎啦，可能需要再延多十五分鐘嘅話，係需要大家冇反對先，我先咁做法好嘛？因為我希望佢多啲時間誒。

249
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:15,950
啊！多謝主席。噉就都再聽咗即係二十多位嘅誒，朝早逐日嘅朋友嘅意見啦。咁都即係基本上，我哋對嗰個貧窮問題嘅掌握或者大家嘅認知咧，都都係類似嘅。但係真係講緊教育啦、就業啦，同埋一啲支援嘅措。

250
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:35,960
司啦，同埋佢哋究竟對嗰個，即係政府即即使我哋做好多嘅服務，或者提供服務咧，佢哋究竟知唔知啦？咁呢個我覺得我哋係即係作為即係政府，我哋今日嘅代表，我哋喺扶貧委員會嘅範疇裡面，我哋經常都討論嘅。噉我都誒會即係將今日聽到。

251
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:55,970
見我哋再翻去考慮啦。咁由頭先有啲特別嘅唔同嘅誒誒朋友都有提出一啲問題，特別有一個咧，我都想好簡單講一講啦。因為有一女士都講到佢嗰個作為一個少數族裔嘅女性，佢想出嚟做嘢咧。噉佢其實嗰個誒叫做誒幼兒嘅照顧服務咧，其實都。

252
01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:15,980
未必到位，尤其是個時間嗰個問題。咁呢樣嘢咧，我哋亦都喺我哋個婦女委員會嘅範疇裏面，因為都都關注嗰個婦女勞工嗰個嗰個參與嘅問題，同埋家庭照顧嘅問題咧。我哋即係勞工及福利局咧，其實都都開展咗一個嘅顧問研究，亦都睇緊即係呢方面嗰個政府嘅誒提供。

253
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,090
啊，我唔該，先生。

254
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,370
佢話：勞工處許生就係呃要咁講鹹雞。

255
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:48,380
入幼稚園去區裏邊兩間最好嘅幼稚園咧，係被拒嘅。

256
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,080
佢根本係唔唔收佢個女，就係因為佢嘅膚色。

257
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:25,610
嘅誒服務就業服務大師啦，又或者係我哋而家申請嗰兩個嘅少數族裔嘅就業助理啦，佢哋都已經能夠用佢語言提供咗需佢服需要服務啦。

258
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:28,560
咁喺呢方面，咁亦都喺GCEC嗰個資歷、中文資歷嗰方面咧，我哋亦都係彈性處理嘅。咁好希望喺呢幾方面嘅時候咧，就係幫助得到咧，就係非華語嘅同學。

259
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:43,710
誒，各位委員，我哋時間就非常之有限咧。咁但係我哋都暫時有三位委員試咗意想發言，仲邊位委員想試想發言？我已經有三位，張珠紅完第一位㗎。嚇，如果我哋有啲三分鐘時間先好嘛？我哋啊，唔該。

260
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:23,030
就係第一，政府有冇喺委任誒我哋呢啲諮詢架構嘅時候咧，有冇一個政策係要少數族裔咧係有一個比例，係讓佢哋喺各方面嘅諮詢架構咧都能夠有一個代表性。

261
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:35,990
服務可唔可以即係都支援到？即係女性或者家庭嗰個嗰個配套出嚟工作啦。咁誒頭先佢講到有啲服務咧，其實就係比較早收啊。噉啊，未必就到好多媽媽啊工作誒父母嗰個需要。噉就而家我哋都做緊一啲唔同嘅措施咧，就係令到嗰個即係幼兒照顧價。

262
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:56,000
誒嗰個課後支援啦，第一樣，第二樣都有一啲幼兒中心咧，係特別開到比較夜一啲嘅，咁都就到即係一啲啊工作婦女嘅需要啦。噉我哋呢方面咧都會喺婦聯委員會嘅範疇繼續跟進嘅嗰個研究，即係完咗，我哋都會再睇一睇嘅措施。不過即係即係喺咁多位裡面，佢即係提到呢樣，我都特別想。

263
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:34,820
多謝主席。噉就住喺教育方面嘅時候咧，我哋好多謝大家咧，畀我哋咁多意見咧。咁事實上咧，喺一四一五學年開始，我哋推行中國語文課程第二語言學習架構之後咧，我哋係承諾咗咧，我哋係繼續會收集數據咧喺呢方面咧係。

264
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:54,830
做到研究咧，咁然之後跟住睇清楚咧，就係非華語學生咧個需要。咁其實喺呢段期間，我哋亦都明白咧，非華語學生咧有好多唔同嘅需要嘅時候咧，我哋已經係幾條腿走路咧，就住喺脱貧嗰方面咧，好希望咧能夠透過咧教育咧喺個資力嗰方面中文。

265
01:04:54,830 --> 01:05:14,840
資歷嗰方面咧，係幫到佢哋。咁大家頭先都有講得到咧，一方面咧就係同學可以以佢誒G C S C嘅成績，其他方面嘅成績嚟到入大學啦。咁另外亦都有方面嘅時候咧，高中嘅學生咧亦都係可以咧係學習應用中文課程嘅。

266
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:54,700
誒提供啲單張啊，介紹無論職安健又好啦，又或者係一啲勞工保障又好啦，或者就業服務都好咧，我哋都係有用誒唔同嘅小數字語言係誒刊印啲單張嘅。咁呢間單張除咗係有啲實體嘅單張之外咧，我哋亦都係放咗上網上面去教育翻誒。

267
01:05:54,700 --> 01:06:14,710
誒一啲市民啦，咁亦都喺尤其是職安嗰邊啦，亦都係用咗一啲多圖少字嘅。噉我哋亦都做咗啲外展服務嘅，勞工處亦都同一啲工會啦，會亦都去到底盤嗰處有啲一啲午間講座，係同我哋講解一啲職安健嘅誒知識噉樣樣。咁如果你話講到，亦都好有啲有啲唔同嘅朋友睇到。

268
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:34,720
一啲傳譯服務咧，咁誒勞工處亦都會係主動為一啲啊少數族裔人士咧係提供個傳譯服務嘅。就以就業服務為例啦，我哋啊今年一月至到五月咧，所有嚟勞工處嘅就業中心或者招聘中心用就業服務嘅少數族裔人士咧，我哋一定會係。

269
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:54,730
向佢主動介紹我哋嘅傳譯服務，亦都有一份單張請佢簽翻畀我哋睇，就係佢要定唔要傳譯服務。咁今年一至五月咧，我哋總共有一千零七十二個消數罪人士利用過我哋就業服務就業中心啦。噉我哋都向佢哋提供誒傳譯服務啦。咁亦都因應佢哋要求咧，就係提供咗十一次嘅傳譯服務嘅。

270
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:14,950
咁至於你話啊，點解嗰啲有另外一啲人係唔需要全職服務咧？咁根據我哋即係佢填翻翻嚟嘅咧，其實有誒百分之九十八點二啦，其實佢哋認為佢嘅中文英文咧已經足夠同我哋溝通得到啦，所以就唔需要全職服務啦。另外咧亦都因為我哋嘅就業中心裏面一啲有一啲少數族裔嘅。

271
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,690
公平公正嘅。

272
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:18,580
先好啊，然後就到關住線。

273
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,180
主席，佢就算畀張英文表格佢。

274
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:38,360
即係呢個係驚人，同埋絕對不能接受嘅。

275
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:56,120
咁即係如果你話教育係我哋一個主要脱貧嘅誒渠道咧，我哋今日嘅教育咧，我亦都好多謝幾位年輕人啦。佢哋一語中的就係話，而家呢個所謂誒中文作為第二語言嘅架構咧，係冇課程。

276
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:33,800
法國咧啲少數族裔嗰個絕學率係好高嘅，尼泊爾裔咧係去到兩成，講緊中學form five以前嘅絕學率。如果係有特殊教育需要嗰啲嘅少數族裔嘅絕學率咧，係去到百分之五十七。

277
01:07:44,140 --> 01:08:04,150
好誒，多謝主席，呢個係一個好重要議題，亦都多謝咁多團體上嚟咧。我哋就疲於奔命，因為咧下底又申訴，又有誒其他嘅活動，而家又開緊教育，咁誒，其實真係搞唔掂啊！我哋噉，但係誒，我誒時間咁短咧，我只能夠好簡單問咧。

278
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:43,450
咁即係呢個係回回應翻阿阿山媽話嗰邊。另外啱啱教育局嘅朋誒同事咧就話誒教育好重要噉樣。但係我啱聽到嗰位媽媽講咧誒，頭先呢位係誒Miss阿Birtefassu，佢提到佢兩個佢佢個女去申請。

279
01:08:54,360 --> 01:09:14,370
咁呢個簡直就係歧視嚟啊！呢個呢個係即係不能接受啊！咁但係佢話究竟邊個負責？我都想問下究竟邊個負責？我亦都聽到誒誒ProfessorPujaKapai，Kapai佢之前咧同呢個SullivanFoundation做咗個研究咧。

280
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:16,410
冇課程、冇教材、冇考核、冇評核嘅制度咧，其實係完全幫唔到而家少數族裔。噉我都想集中問翻啦，即係教育局就住呢幾方面有冇誒一啲嘅回應誒？但係嗰個代表性，我都希望誒政務司司長嗰邊都答一答。好啊，或者葉女士先。

281
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:39,190
好啊！多謝主席。噉就住第一個問題咧，係關於幼稚園咧少數族裔學生入學嘅問題嘅時候咧，咁教育局喺呢方面咧已經係再次提醒咧，就係幼稚園嗰方面咧，就係最基本咧，佢哋都需要做到咧，就係。

282
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:59,200
你嗰個申請表咧都要係中英文嘅。咁另外咧，我哋亦都喺呢方面咧係加強監管嘅，尤其是當我哋一七一八學年咧推行咗優質教育誒優質幼稚園教育嗰方面。咁呢度第一點。咁第二點咧就係關於唔係佢佢話唔收。

283
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:22,580
佢連派都唔派畀佢，咁點啊？你整咗張英文表冇用㗎。喺執法上啲咩可以做得到咧？或者投訴去邊度投訴咧？除咗評議會之外，我哋一定係會接受呢方面嘅投訴㗎。我哋喺幼稚園方方面咧已經講清楚畀幼稚園聽，你冇理由表格都唔收，一定係嗰個申請咧係公平。

284
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:44,500
好誒，關女士有冇補充啊？要關於嗰個比例問題係個啊，主席噉樣嘅噉，我哋而家咧就誒，以我嘅理解咧，政府裡面即係委任呢個誒一啲諮詢架構裏面嘅成員咧，都要睇翻即係當然嗰個諮詢架構本身嗰個工作啦，同埋即係誒我哋推薦嘅一啲。

285
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:02,180
連覺得係幫唔到佢咧。

286
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,170
啊，麥美娟議員計。

287
01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:00,540
不過咧，佢哋覺得你哋啲嘢幫唔到佢。

288
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:57,190
翻文件咧嗱，其實今日都聽咗咁多個團體，無論第一節都第二節咧，其實好簡單，大家講樣嘢嘅啫，就係你哋係覺得你做咗好多嘢。

289
01:11:44,500 --> 01:12:04,510
即係委任嘅時候咧，嗰個人事嘅背景啊，同埋佢個相關經驗啊，我哋都主要考慮嗰樣。咁如果純粹就話啊，誒以少數族裔嗰個嗰個做一個比例咧，我理解就而家未有嘅。咁但係咧，即係誒，我諗我比較即係都負責翻埋，熟悉翻扶貧方面咧。我哋譬如盡量希望咧，我哋都聽多啲少數族裔嘅聲。

290
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:24,520
咁咧，我哋每一年個扶貧委員高峯會咧都好刻意咧，就希望有一啲特別嘅。雖然都都好多人都上嚟噉，我哋都特別有一啲誒預留咗一啲誒位置咧，就即係畀啲少數族裔朋友嚟。每一年咧都都實在都，我哋都誒叫做都誒容納咗一部分啦。

291
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:44,530
都有部分嚟過我哋嗰度，亦都有發言嘅。咁大家講嗰啲誒意見，我哋翻去亦都有相對嘅跟進啦。不過即係誒，我都理解大家個喺呢方面嗰個訴求嘅。噉就誒喺行政長官佢最新嗰個即係啱啱講個施政報告咧，佢誒唔係施政報告，sorry，對唔住，係呢個誒政綱裡面，其實佢。

292
01:12:44,530 --> 01:13:04,540
如果特別有講到咧，點支援小數族類六點裡面其中一點咧，都係講到係嗰個誒叫做誒，我哋諮詢架構裡面咧，盡量都希望可以嘅吸納多啲咧小數族類嘅人才嘅。噉我相信咧，呢個政府內部我哋相關嘅同事咧，會因應呢個噉嘅整體嘅方向咧，會繼續跟進嘅嚇。可唔可以喺扶貧委員會加一個？

293
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:24,550
少數族裔嘅代表咧？誒，我哋喺委任嘅時候，我哋會全面考慮嘅。咁啱啱我哋續咗一年啦，今年嗰個扶貧委員會嗰個誒任期。噉我哋誒完咗呢個任期咧，當然即係政務司司長同埋即係我哋高層，或者我哋喺誒match人選，亦都睇翻我哋工作嘅方向咧，我哋會作一個整體嘅考慮。好，我哋請。

294
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:47,200
主席誒，首先要多謝咁多位團體同埋誒代表佢哋一齊嚟表達意見啦。咁即係，好似張超員所講啦，我哋真係唔好意思，因為我哋同一時間開緊幾個會，咁所以即係誒頭先第一節嘅時候咧，我哋都要去做申訴噉。咁咧就誒，我想問下咧誒政府咧，其實誒跟翻。

295
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:20,830
咁實在咧，即係你哋有冇諗下咧？究竟個Mismatch喺邊度咧？嗱，譬如誒政府又畀咗咁多資源嗰啲學校嘅，咁但係咧，即係如果收少咗啲學生學校，咁但係咧嗰啲同學咧，佢哋無論喺學語文啊等等各方面喺學習上，仍然遇到困難嘅。咁而家我見到政府咧文件仲話。

296
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:40,840
咧要做個，但係咩少數族對主要公共服務嘅認知研究，仲要慢慢研究。咁其實你唔使研究，我相信你，你研究出嚟嘅結果可能就係同我哋而家開會聽到嘅就係一樣，就係唔係好知咯，係嘛？噉佢哋點解會遇到呢啲貧窮嘅問題啫？因為佢唔知道呢啲嘢可以有，我哋社會有好多嘅資源可以幫到佢咯。其實我真係想問咧，即係嗱。

297
01:14:40,840 --> 01:15:00,850
唔好唔好話，一間就教育人民教育局啦，一間誒誒勞工人民勞工處啊，即係政府邊個會去諗究竟個mismatch喺邊度？即係唔同嘅部門都有mismatch嘅。咁究竟個mismatch嗰個個唔嗰個錯配喺邊度？點解你哋覺得你哋做好咁多嘢，但係少數做嘢嘅人士？

298
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:22,970
呢個邊個做嘅？應該邊位回應嘅？關你事啊！噉啊，啊莫美娟議員頭先提到嗰個誒研研究係我哋扶貧委員會其中一個專責小組，我哋即係特別就係今因為因應想睇下，就係你講嗰個錯配問題啦。我哋政府咁大量嘅服務，咁多部門，咁多公服務，我哋都希望。

299
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:42,980
望即係香港市民咧，無論咩種族都應該有需要係應該用到嘅。咁但係正正又出面即係一個問題就係啊，我哋提供咗又似乎佢哋又未必即係用得到，或者甚至唔知添。噉就變咗我估咧喺呢個問題就係溝通都好重要。咁喺呢個嘅研究裡面咧，我哋特別咧都唔係話用好多即係。

300
01:15:42,980 --> 01:16:02,990
自己我哋內部做好多噉嘅誒叫做誒分析啊，或者成嘅。噉我哋主要呢個噉嘅研究咧，我哋主要誒去收集嗰個意見咧，係透過啲focus group啊，即係啲針對小組。咁都係請翻業家、小道作祟。噉佢哋話翻畀我哋聽，分門分門別類，主要一啲政府部門咧，佢哋其實。

301
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:23,000
覺得點解去唔到佢哋嗰度，同埋佢哋覺得用嘅時候嘅困難喺邊度？噉我哋都即係希望呢個嗱呢個研究，我哋亦都唔係話要做好耐嘅。噉我哋講緊今年內咧，我哋希望都有一個報告出嚟。噉就誒，其實呢個好事，我要打斷你啊，因為我時間唔多，我都唔想我哋嘅會成日噉樣over run噉樣加落去。我想問咧，就係。

302
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:43,050
誒嗱，你話頭先講嗰個研究，你你因為你係喺代表扶貧委員會，咁所以你講啦。嗯。但係實在呢樣嘢係咪咁喺政府嘅部門裏邊係咪就係成個扶貧委員會去睇點解會出現mismatch咧？咁咪唔啱嘅喎？點解淨係扶貧委員會咧？點解唔係一個高層次啲嘅機構或者架構？

303
01:16:43,050 --> 01:17:03,060
去睇點解會出現呢個mismatch？如果淨係靠扶貧委員會做份研究，話我個mismatch喺邊度噉，但係你係可能係睇緊啲扶貧措施嘅啫。但係我哋而家講緊嘅可能係學業啊、教育啊、咩房屋啊、周圍都有嘅喎，醫療都有嘅喎。即係我想問題邊一改？究竟政府有冇啊？如果冇啊，你哋會唔會考慮整一個？

304
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,490
Mission on ethnic minorities.

305
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:22,610
please，right and three，there's this attitude mentality thing。

306
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:43,880
There you are, and as such, fail to tackle the needs of ethnic minorities living in poverty.

307
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:53,120
God's sake, I need to ask the the government, especially the representative Ms Kwan of the CS office.

308
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:32,490
civil servants need to adopt a rights-based approach. That's so good, rights-based.

309
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:34,780
在段落16的Professor Capai的提交，它説：這裡現行措施似乎過寬泛和過於一般化。

310
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:23,070
出嚟一定要睇曬oversee曬咁多樣嘢。誒，時間關係，好唔好？我誒或者你下一次有機會嘅時候，誒關女士再一次過，或者書面上補充回應。我哋仲都仲有啲時間討論下嘅。因為我想畀埋無漫正議員最後嗰三分鐘時間。唔該誒，唔該主席。I think the answer to that question probably is。

311
01:17:44,230 --> 01:18:04,240
Well, I would even say, you guys, well, not personally, but it's all very half-hearted. All your policies, all your measures, some of you genuinely try to help, but most would just take it as a job. I've done it, and I've, I have to have pity about.

312
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:24,250
Mr. Assan Mawa has left. I need to tell him actually that during my gatherings with ethnic minority groups, especially women's groups, I always tell them: you need at least one ethnic minority legislator in Hong Kong, at least one member.

313
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:44,260
In this council to be representative of the entire community, and most of the ladies would find this, they they would shy away thinking it's some unthinkable, unrealistic suggestion. No, it's not, right? We are in the year of 2017.

314
01:18:53,710 --> 01:19:13,720
Would you actually consider Professor Kapai's suggestion that one, we need a thorough, comprehensive review of what's happened in Hong Kong about ethnic minority poverty; two, that the government should set up a

315
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:52,780
approach， you're not doing charity， you're not doing welfare， it's rights we're talking about. Three questions， could you reply please？好啊，或者請政府代表回答之前咧，容許我，如果冇大家在座嘅委員冇反對嘅話咧，再延長多五分鐘時間好嘛？等政府官員有充分嘅時間答。

316
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:33,260
咧。

317
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:11,190
過嚟就呢個種族歧視條例咧嘅進程咧，作一個比較全面或者高度啲嘅睇法或者個解釋好嘛？噉我哋就如果冇其他意見嘅話咧，我哋今日嘅議程到此為止。Thanks very much for attending this afternoon. Thank you，唔該曬咁多位嚇，多謝曬，多謝咁多位，我哋政府代表多謝曬。

318
01:19:52,780 --> 01:20:12,790
關於呢三個問題，唔該啊，關電視。Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman. So the first question, are we need a comprehensive review on what we are doing? Yes, that's why we are here. And then we have a lot of analysis, analysis and review and policy research on all those issues.

319
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:32,800
relating to the EMS and the poverty analysis is one of the basis. So we know what we are, you know, the basis and the foundations we are at, and then what the problems they are facing and the social characteristics. These are the basics that we need to have in order to formulate or think about the the future strategies we need.

320
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:52,810
On the second question on whether we need a high-level commission, this is really not in my position to answer. But I will, you know, bring all these comments back to the administration for, you know, consideration in a higher level. And on the third, right-based approach for our public service delivery, definitely.

321
01:20:52,810 --> 01:21:12,820
Yes, we are not doing welfare as you said. We are doing our job, so that's why we are here. And we want to know what our services will do to us, to the to the recipients, and what are the you know areas that we can focus in order to improve them, in order to to have a better access to them. So

322
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:32,830
呢個係我哋嘅目標。噉，我哋嘅議程咧，就係我

323
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:54,300
係慢慢同你傾，冇錯。慢慢同啲冇嘅。咁亦都咧，我哋誒，由於我哋都誒，依一年嘅疫情已經完咗啦，我哋希望喺十月份咧就會再安排時間。咁而下一次咧，大家如果冇反對嘅咧，我建議咧，我哋首先或者會諮詢大家嘅翻議題上嘅意見啦。然之後，我哋都希望可以請到我哋嘅或者問問責嘅局長嗰啲官員咧。
