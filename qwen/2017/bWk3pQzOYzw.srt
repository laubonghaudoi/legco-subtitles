好，趁而家少啲空檔時間，容許我介紹下今日出席嘅官誒政府嘅代表咧，有誒政務司司長嘅私人辦公室政策及項目統籌處副處長關婉怡女士咧，歡迎誒教育局首席助理秘書長及統籌委員會埋策劃嘅葉凌碧女士，歡迎有誒在職家庭嘅。

15
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:47,950
喺團體入席嘅同時，容我介紹下大家。今日我哋咧就會係誒有多個頻道咧，方便大家收聽嘅。零頻道咧就係本場現場嘅版本啦。一頻道就係廣東話版本，二頻道係英語版本，三頻道咧就係普通話版本嘅。亦都提醒大家咧，就誒我哋誒會有計時行到誒我哋每。

16
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:13,550
as ethnic minorities face difficulties in livelihood, education, employment, language barrier is the key factor is affecting their daily activities as well as upward mobility. South Asian group especially Pakistanis with large families and more dependent children face greater difficulty.

17
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,970
誒，跟住請嗱，工黨嘅胡瑞山主席。

18
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:15,530
consequenceley assist them to social conclusion and upward mobility. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Latif.

19
00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:07,490
second language, extend support to teachers for teaching Chinese as a second language, and enhance support to parents of ethnic minority students in order to provide more information and establish network.

20
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:33,560
in lifting themselves out of poverty, even if they had working members. Therefore, household with children saw visibly higher poverty risk among the South Asian household, and the phenomenon of their being among the working poor was also relatively common.

21
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:53,570
To conclude, that South Asian group were the more disadvantaged ethnic minorities groups in Hong Kong, as their household with children saw visibly higher poverty risk. We recommend that the government should ensure support for learning Chinese language starting from pre-primary education, develop the curriculum on Chinese as a

22
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:28,080
We hope that the EDB will advise the comprehensive education policy for ethnic minorities students that will achieve the following objectives. Firstly, help ethnic minorities integrate into mainstream of Hong Kong society. Secondly, to help gain the credential and recognition for future development in.

23
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:48,090
education in employment. Thirdly, give ethnic minorities necessary skills, including sufficient Chinese language, so that they can have equal opportunities in being competitive, contributing member of the Hong Kong society. Poverty risk is also closely linked to employment.

24
00:04:48,090 --> 00:05:08,100
while economic growth, job creation and skill upgrading, upgrading the conductive poverty alleviation in source, the labor department, employment, retraining board and vocational training education should continue to provide services to support the employment of ethnic minorities, including the provision

25
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:28,110
提供合適的職業相關訓練，以促進技能提升和收入增長，特別是為亞裔少數族裔女性。Having taken root in Hong Kong, many ethnic minorities are locally born and raised. They have already become members of our society. It is

26
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:48,120
of utmost importance for them to integrate into the community and live and work in contentment. The government should continue to foster community cohesion among ethnic minorities and give them support while assisting them in public services. Publicity integrated to ethnic

27
00:05:48,120 --> 00:06:08,130
民族，尤其是南亞人，會被Step by the Home Affairs Bureau for the implementation of being effective and fruitful supportive on the public and services. 最後，我會説，讓民族人士 person to reduce difficulties in livelihood, employment and education due to language barrier.

28
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:41,200
誒，主席你好，今日咧，我就希望咧係去講翻少少有關於小數罪弱弱喺就業上邊所遇到嘅問題。小數罪弱嘅貧窮咧，好大程度上都係嚟自咧佢哋係冇辦法只得到體面啦，同埋穩定嘅就業。咁呢一方面咧，我哋覺得勞工處咧係責無旁貸，係要有一個積極嘅介入嘅。

29
00:06:41,200 --> 00:07:01,210
包括係應該要成立一個咧係協助少數族裔就業嘅誒就業科啦。咁裏邊咧應該要包括有一啲咧係少數族裔自己本身擔任翻嘅一啲就業主任，噉係可以瞭解翻佢哋嘅文化啦，同埋佢哋嘅需要咧係提供更加適切嘅幫助。因為好多時候佢哋都提誒講到。

30
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:21,220
咧話遇到去勞工處嘅時候，因為各種文化上面嘅差異咧，其實喺一隻誒配對嘅工作上邊咧，其實就係好難嘅。咁而家咧已經取消咗嗰個就業配對服務啊，尤其是咁好多少數族裔都提出咧，係其實誒好多時候普通一般嘅個案主任其實未必都可以應應到佢哋嘅資。

31
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,630
責任。

32
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,990
好唔該，胡小姐。

33
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,210
係低薪嘅，咁呢個係大大限制咗銷售業嘅發展嘅。

34
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:36,110
We will now invite Ms. Lena Pusikana, of the committee member of the DAB Ethnic Minorities Committee, please.

35
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:41,230
力啊期望同埋需要畀到佢哋合適嘅幫助，咁所以咧就有需要咧重新咧係去設立一個少數族裔求職者嘅就業配套嘅服務。另外一方面咧，就其實好多誒僱主方面嘅教育工作咧都係非常之重要嘅。咁尤其是係要協助翻一啲唔係咁熟悉少數族裔。

36
00:07:41,230 --> 00:08:01,240
嘅生活習慣啊，或者佢哋嘅文化嘅誒人事管理人員，其實都需要透過一啲譬如翻譯支援啊，同埋一啲誒誒支持嘅服務，提高佢哋嘅文化嘅敏感程度咧。噉就係令到佢哋同少數族裔嘅求職者之間咧，可以增進翻個瞭解。而家其實好多時候，我哋都缺乏一個。

37
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:21,250
個系統化嘅研究去了解少數族裔佢處於於一個點樣嘅就業嘅困難，就唔似得。譬如好似加拿大嗰邊啦，咁有一啲誒專門係研究少數族裔佢哋首次就業嘅困難嘅一啲研究。咁其實香港亦都應該要盡快去執行啦。另外嘅就係由於好多少數族裔佢自己本身就

38
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:41,260
就業咧，就誒佢哋讀書咧，未必喺香港嗰度完成。咁一啲專業資格嘅認證咧，咁其實亦都係有需要嘅。咁令到佢哋咧可以喺翻自己本身個專業嗰度做嘢，就唔需要即係誒經常就係即係好有大限制噉樣誒，嘗試個別幾個噉樣嘅行業啦。而嗰啲行業好多時候都係。

39
00:08:47,020 --> 00:09:07,030
我哋覺得咧喺成個誒香港嘅誒扶貧嘅政策裏邊咧，其實係缺乏一個誒種族嘅敏感度。咁好多時候，我哋同一啲誒政府官員去了解啊討論呢少數族裔嘅貧窮問題嘅時候咧，政府官員本身個敏感度都好差，經常歸。

40
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:27,040
夠於就係少數族裔，佢哋誒即係個子女數目多啊，又或者係佢哋文化程度唔高啊，呢啲個人嘅因素，但係就忽略咗咧，佢哋喺成個語言啊、就業個市場嘅誒配套各方面呢啲噉嘅制度性嘅限制，政府係應該正視呢方面嘅問題，而唔係推去個人嘅。

41
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:56,420
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. today I would like to draw your attention towards the problem of poverty in ethnic minorities. as the survey shows that in Hong Kong, situation of ethnic minorities is worse than the other public, especially for some groups living under the poverty line because

42
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:16,430
因為大家庭，有更多孩子，男人有要日以繼夜地工作來養家，因為這會奪走他們的家庭生活。這些民族少數羣體的低收入，有其根源在他們在香港的起點。這個貧窮的起點在他們的生活中繼續，有貧窮的結果。

43
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:52,980
嘅貧窮情況報告咧，睇到咧，其實小學族裔咧超過有六成咧係唔能夠誒閲讀同埋書寫中文嘅。

44
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:24,480
嘅誒基層啊，或者甚至係靠政府嘅津貼去維持佢哋嘅生計咧，個原因就好簡單，就係個教育嘅問題。

45
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:53,830
咗兩億元去搞個咩中國語文課程、第二語言嘅學習架構，嚟幫助呢啲嘅少數族裔去提升佢哋中文程度。

46
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:04,950
手由佢哋嘅誒族羣領袖入手，希望喺社工方面可以可以去聘請或者去邀請呢啲嘅族羣領袖、宗教領袖去參與。

47
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:13,260
但係其實好多少數族裔嘅朋友都話畀我哋知咧，即係佢哋有關嘅架構咧都係文不對題嘅，即係佢哋連欠缺課程啦、教材啦，甚至一啲公認受性嘅公開考試咧，都係離地嘅，即係唔係配合配合翻佢哋嗰嗰嗰啲嘅有嘅少數族裔嘅人人人。

48
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:36,440
school due to lack of Chinese proficiency, and then continues with discrimination in job market. Even all the jobs or vacancies are advertised in Chinese, therefore EM candidates can't look for jobs. Most companies in Hong Kong require Chinese proficiency. This is

49
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:56,450
Despite the fact that many Westerners work here without knowing the Chinese language and the Chinese without knowing English, inability to get into a wide spectrum of jobs in Hong Kong could be due to the poorer education levels of the EM group, inherent bias or just

50
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:16,460
plain old discrimination. It is ironic that some jobs where they have to deal with ethnic minorities hire Chinese only, whereas they need some ethnic officers in the office. Job posters in Hong Kong need to take harder look at language requirements and.

51
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:36,470
應該考慮 loosening them if it makes sense. Both the government and the private sector need to start embracing and including all communities in Hong Kong. To EM community, Hong Kong is home. Yet this marginalisation manifests itself in.

52
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:56,480
financial and social inclusion. Furthermore, due to language constraint, they are unaware of the availability benefits or facilities they can access. To be truly called a world city, Hong Kong needs to more to stem the marginalised.

53
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:16,490
of its ethnic minority community, there is still no concerted action by the government to make a meaningful impact on improving the lives of EM in Hong Kong. It's right time that government should take some steps to make improvements, access and opportunity.

54
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:36,500
是的key。There's no reason for ethnic minority to perform any less than general population, provided they have access to opportunity. Therefore, more government departments should step in to improve the lives of EMs in Hong Kong to set an example for the world that Hong Kong.

55
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:56,510
care for ethnic minorities. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Puskan.誒，跟住請自由黨嘅李振強先生，唔該。誒，多謝主席。咁其實咧，即係香港都有唔少嘅誒少數族裔嘅朋友喺度。咁喺二零一六年咧，就香港有成二十幾萬嘅少數族裔嘅朋友。

56
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:16,520
有噉，其實佢哋好多人咧，好多代咧都喺度香港嘅生活，即係佢哋放棄佢哋國家嗰個嘅生活嚟到香港去揾食。咁即係作為一個香港人，我哋都係感激佢嘅嘅辛勞嘅。但係個問題就係點解佢哋好多時佢哋重新嘅行業都係一啲嘅低技術，或者係一啲嘅。

57
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:44,770
即係好多時佢哋嚟到香港嘅時候咧，佢哋都帶住佢哋嘅宗教文化嘅嗰個嘅背景嚟到誒香港。好多時佢哋一族族或者一羣羣人去生活，噉佢哋靠香港嘅一啲嘅小補小支小助噉樣去維持佢哋生計。香港政府可能你話喂一四年一五年嗰陣時就投入。

58
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:33,730
有啲中學生甚至讀到高中咧，佢哋基本連中文都唔識嘅個原因其實好簡單，因為佢喺學校咪淨係聽中文咯。佢哋唔識講，佢哋都係同嗰班人去玩，同跟住翻到屋企又同嗰班人去去去傾偈。基本上佢都冇接受到中文嘅文化，中國人嘅文化，佢點可以去？

59
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,080
期望咧，應該畀佢哋有知即係知情權。

60
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,850
我會 now invite Ms. Rubina Limbo of the Cleaning Worker Union, please.

61
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:32,450
提供一啲嘅小語族裔嘅文化敏感度培訓啊，噉佢主動去提供傳譯服務，同埋制定一啲嘅流程，等到咧可以誒，即係佢哋可以真係使用到到翻譯服務，同埋咧收集小語族裔嘅數據，嚇佢哋使用服務嘅滿意程度等等。好多謝主席，唔該曬啊，林女士、羅女士。

62
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:53,740
去接觸更多英文咧，所以其實我哋自由黨就建議翻政府應該投入多啲更多嘅資源，去令到呢啲噉樣嘅誒，尤其是啲後生一輩嘅誒少數族裔去學習多啲中文。點樣去學習多啲中文？就由佢哋嘅宗教入。

63
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:25,530
畀多啲嘅中文一啲嘅課程，包括可能宗教嘅課程啊，甚至係一啲嘅家訪等等，等到佢哋可以可以去更加容易接觸中文，唔好就一味喺佢哋嘅圈子裏邊玩佢哋語言語裏邊嘅生活。第二就喺我嘅頭先個勞工嘅市場配對問題啦，其實。

64
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:45,540
香港嘅建造業嗰個就業人口，大家都見到係非常之不足。我哋成日自由黨成日成日都希望請一啲外勞。其實依個少數聚會，其實正正係適合翻我哋依班建造業嘅人士可以去投效翻建造業。但係問題就話點解我哋啲建造業嗰啲老闆唔會請？

65
00:15:45,540 --> 00:16:05,550
呢班人啊，個原因就係又係因為中文嘅問題咯。因為呢個判頭式嘅制度，佢哋本身係個基層嘅教育問題，佢哋溝通一定要中文，所以我希望政府幫手大力推廣中文。唔該曬，唔該啊，李生。跟住我哋又請香港社會服務聯會嘅羅林女士，唔該。係多謝主席。咁咧，根據咧政府喺統計處二零一六年嘅。

66
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:25,560
中期人口統計啦，咁小數族裔佔咗八個percent嘅，咁而喺二零一一至一六年間咧，小數族裔每年嘅人口增幅咧係達到三點六個percent，係整體人口嘅增長嘅五倍嚟嘅。噉啊，雖然上一次啊誒，因為都睇翻咧政府報告，就係好似收窄咗小數族裔喺東啊係南亞嘅人士噉。

67
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:45,570
其實呢個係有啲唔係好正確啦嚇。咁其實誒，我哋包括咗東南亞、南亞，佢都係我哋小數族裔嘅對象嚟嘅。誒咁另外咧就係關於誒，其實一早前咧都有啲政府官員就講翻，其實小數族裔因為佢哋咧誒少用唔需要用翻嘅服務，因為佢中穩程度好啊。咁但係咧，其實政府咧喺二零一四年做咗個小數族裔人。

68
00:16:53,330 --> 00:17:13,340
咁另外咧，社聯咧喺上一年嘅時候咧，都做咗小幼族裔嘅關注事項啦，同埋投票意向嘅一個研究嘅，發現咧只有一成嘅小幼族裔咧可以讀寫中誒讀寫中文嘅啫。咁所以喺可以睇到咧，其實佢中文能力係差，所以唔可以用呢一個話哦，佢中文能力誒進步咗啦，所以唔使提供翻譯服務呢個係唔成立嘅。

69
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:33,350
呢個藉口咁咧，其實睇翻又個報告咧，貧窮情況報告咧，亦都睇到咧，八十五嘅percent咧，其實少數族裔係冇使用過政府嘅服務。咁其實我哋發覺咧，其實好多時候可能政府服務都係一視同仁，但係我哋覺得咧，其實佢哋咧係有特別嘅需要，所以好難用一視同仁呢個政策，而係應該要用無障礙為一個原則去提供服務畀。

70
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:53,360
少數族裔人士係無障礙，而係一視同仁嚇咁咧。希望咧，即係政誒以至咧，其實政府可以多啲去服務呢啲少數族人，幫助佢哋誒脱貧嘅。咁咧，我哋都社聯都有提出三方面嘅建議啊。就住教育嗰方面咧，其實我哋建議咧出版少誒中文為第二語言嘅教材同埋習作咁咧。其實誒中文為第二。

71
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:13,370
語言嘅學習架構咧，雖然推行咗三年啦，但係都仲未有一啲嘅教材同埋習作出嚟嘅。咁誒，同埋亦都未有定定咧呢一個長中短期嘅具體目標啦、量度指標啦，同埋監管嘅方法等等。咁咧，每年咧投資即係投放咧係二億幾嘅資源落去啦。咁喺超過二百間嘅中小學都有攞啲啲額。

72
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:33,380
外資源，但係呢二百間嘅中小學咧係冇公佈出嚟嘅，咁以致咧嗰個透明度不足啊。其實中誒其實家長或者學生去揀學校嘅時候都係一個困難，同埋咧其實喺冇資源同埋講緊係八十至一百五十萬之間，每間學校攞到呢個資源嘅數目咧，誒同冇資源之間係差好遠嘅。噉我諗都要有個合理。

73
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:56,510
咁第二方面咧就係就業嗰度，咁其實咧誒行政長官啊林鄭月娥女士嘅競誒競選政綱都有講到咧，政府應該有系統去檢視各個公務員職級嘅誒中文書寫要求，咁咧讓讓到咧小數族裔係可以更加多去加入咧政府工作機會，同埋咧喺就業支援嗰方面咧，勞工處應該主動去提供全譯服。

74
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:43,720
會話畀中文班佢哋嘅，佢哋都閒時閒刻先至去上到，咁所以其實都好難。佢哋可能喺嗰度生活咧，亦都係比我哋始終比較華人啦，係比較吃虧少少。

75
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:12,170
其實都係有阻礙嘅，即係喺用户嘅角度去睇下個需要翻譯服務，而唔係由官員嘅角度去睇係咪需要翻譯服務。仲有誒，我哋都要求一個對具代表性或者基層聲音嘅數據委員會啦。我哋睇過中文關係科入邊。

76
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:36,990
extra， also not enough support in social service， example no ERB course for mid-aged Nepalis。 lastly， universal pension scheme is required to protect the EM workers and their young generation。 thank you so much。

77
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:16,520
冇啦，聘請少數族裔啦，同埋提供一啲嘅就業輔導啊、工作選配同埋轉介，亦都向誒其他嗰啲嘅誒誒人士去鼓勵去請誒聘請少數族裔嘅。好誒咁誒第三方面，我講埋少少，係喺公共服務嗰方面，其實咧都希望咧就係係誒加強咧公共誒喺公職人員咧去誒。

78
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:58,100
自二零一五年至現在，清潔工人聯盟有數次請

79
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:18,110
2% of them are non-skilled workers. Majority are Pakistani and Nepalese. In Hong Kong, I am working in soft contract cleaning company known as grassroots workers, and and is most entitled with low socio-economic status. I am coming to settle.

80
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:38,120
In Hong Kong, can only engage in lower-skilled job such as cleaning job, as they struggle with the Chinese languages. Thus, they are urged to pay. Sorry, thus they are urged to work where they also struggle with the low salary. As to the median monthly employment.

81
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:58,130
earnings， the median wage is Hong Kong dollar ten thousand for EM cleaner， which is lower than the median wage compared with the Hong Kong dollar twelve thousand for all workforces in Hong Kong. Hence， the earnings are not sufficient to support their families and support their living.

82
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:18,140
Usually they take two jobs or overtime work and they reduce the daily food to save money for the children. Based on the poverty situation report on ethnic minorities 2014, the report showed that among the other EM, Nepali had a poverty rate of 13.6%.

83
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:38,320
The poverty rate of EM family is being underestimated. They are facing many unjust situations and narrow development path. Reflecting from the data of statistics, the government has not provided effective service for the mid-age EM workers. With no doubt.

84
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:58,330
The disadvantage will pass on the next generation if no policy assists to change the situation, and thus intergenerational poverty will occur. To recommend on the policy, statutory min minimum wages will be reviewed every year because the minimum wage is not updated to the

85
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:18,340
food price, standard working hour need to be legislated. Since long a working hour, workers don't have time for their family. Since the common language of Hong Kong is English and Chinese for mid-Asian workers, there are not enough language translator in hospital service, housing department.

86
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:57,280
Thank you, Mr. Limbu。誒，跟住我哋有請天主教香港牧香港教區教區勞工牧民中心九龍支部嘅李家樹先生，唔該。係，多謝主席。誒，天主教誒勞工牧民中心誒迪世工啊，係啊。咁誒講一少少俗語嘅貧窮嘅成因啊、背景嗰啲咧，我諗之前嘅講者都講曬嘅，基本上係啦，我冇補充嗱噉。

87
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:17,290
個補充嘅係呢幾點啦。咁其實咧，誒正點解呢？數族嘅貧窮情況會持續咧？其實除咗呢啲因素之外咧，其實喺誒各個資助入邊咧，譬如交通津貼啊，同埋呢個低補誒低低低津啊，其實佢支出率低啦，誒使用率低啦。其實誒其他部門誒對其他部門嘅前線服務咧，佢上唔到係低低嘅。

88
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:37,300
即係舉個例，譬如勞工處誒呢個中年就業計劃入邊咧，二千九百七十八個人入邊咧係得廿九個係少族人士嘅啫。即係好話唔好聽，我哋一間冇政府資助嘅誒教區直接資助嘅機構啦嚇，我哋兩個人嘅一個服務兩兩人就要服務我哋嘅中年人士已經係超過呢個數字㗎啦。

89
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:57,310
係啊，即係咧，同埋誒，同埋再同埋，真係唔好話我哋誒啊，你哋做得好啊！呢啲機構誒，記住我哋唔係攞緊納税人嘅錢嘅，你哋係攞緊納税人嘅錢嘅。而攞完納税人嘅錢之後咧，誒，即係服務就唔到位啦。跟住又我要我哋呢啲民間嘅團體去操作咧，即係希望大誒，希望各位在座嘅官員咧都係。

90
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:17,320
留意翻呢樣嘢，係啊，仲有喺誒第二個例子就係喺房署方面啦。啊，誒啊房署嘅職員又話啊，我哋會提供翻嘅服務㗎，一定噉樣。但係誒，亦都我哋都信咧，夾夾曬啲民事事務署嘅誒服務中心㗎，噉樣諮詢服務中心佢哋會提供呢個服服務畀你㗎。我哋啲蘇姓嘅街坊打到去係。

91
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:37,360
誒翻譯服務應該係房署負責嘅喎，噉佢係咩一回事咧？係啦，咁仲有就係誒都係。如果要誒介紹到做嘅朋友問題，除咗喺住屋方面，你畀佢正常可以入，至少可以畀佢一個正常嘅程序可以go through到去之外，仲有勞工署都要請翻啲M啦，同埋我哋重複好多次。

92
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:57,370
嘅銷售組就係科啦，包括研究啦，就係配對啦，請翻銷售組嘅集主任噉樣嘅。誒，咁同埋再加上翻譯方面咧，各個部門都要其實唔好再抱住一啲好舊嘅心態，就係：，喂，你識講廣東話、話英文啊？全程同你一兩嘴係咁講中文、話英文啊？其實佢哋未必程度未必係理想中咁流暢，咁對你嘅程序。

93
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:32,520
誒嗰啲中和係委員會，其實誒都嘅會議入邊都缺乏啲基層嘅直接聲音嘅，係啦。另外最後想講嘅就係低收入家庭學歷嘅認證資助計劃咧，因為啲開學歷嘅消逐裔，佢有開學歷，但係喺香港揾唔到相應嘅工作。誒政府睇到嘅，投資有八百六十萬入去，但係咧佢用上去。

94
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:52,530
想用綜援同埋學資處還申請援難問，誒冇錯嘅，冇錯嘅。但係個問題係，有啲家庭佢可能有高學歷嘅小朋友喺外地讀完書翻嚟啦，就係靠佢揾食嘅啫。屋企人貧窮，可能佢做阿姨嚟到啊，可能就會嘅脱貧嘅啦。但係無奈就係未夠一年攞唔到綜援同埋。

95
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,690
好似而家噉。

96
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,020
睇同角寫中文。

97
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,330
未必係咁理想啦，大家都睇到。

98
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,730
揾到揾工都好難。

99
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,130
所以好多人都係好窮。

100
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,200
各位先生、女士們，我們 now invite Ms Jakub Maya of the Eco Assets Group，please.

101
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:23,270
問題之外，其實我哋嗰個運輸交通政策，如果一日唔將話嗰個出租車嗰個牌照嗰個批准係放寬啊鬆綁嘅話咧，佢哋想去做一個正正常常揸個車去靠自己勞力去揾食，其實都會好有困難。

102
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:19,290
好多唔係中國人嘅話，都唔知點聽。而家政府提出補貼啲方，同埋有好有啲海報得中文，我哋都唔明白。去到啲政府office睇。

103
00:28:43,560 --> 00:29:01,920
令到佢哋起碼至少可以喺度揾靠自己雙手揾到食，唔好淨係下下要佢哋，淨係好似畀人個感覺佢哋係被邊緣化、被忽視化，甚至被妖魔化，好似咧某啲黨派就話咧嗰啲全部都係難民難民一樣啊！頭先啱啱走咗啦，OK，講完。

104
00:25:52,530 --> 00:26:12,540
佢又唔係讀書攞唔到學資，噉佢又申請唔到樣嘢咯，所以政府可以考慮下有冇其他嘅機制，在彌補呢個漏洞。係我講嘅嘢冇。唔該，李生，跟住我哋請陳家朗先生唔該。啊，唔該，主席。啊，今日講嘅題目就係嗰個少數族裔嘅貧窮情況啦。咁其實咧，我以前做嘢都曾經接觸過一啲咧係。

105
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:32,550
少數族裔嘅團體啊，佢哋噉佢哋好多時都係反映翻咧誒一啲少數族裔佢哋最大嗰個困難係就係中文方面，佢哋係真係比較同我哋個水平係唔同。佢哋係好多誒，尤其是可能係女士，因為喺屋企入面要照顧小朋友，咁變咗其實佢哋係誒要，就算要。

106
00:26:44,000 --> 00:27:04,010
咁講到就業嗰方面啦，嗱講到貧窮啊嘛，噉佢想脱貧啊，噉佢想去做嘢，但係唔好講政府工。頭先啲誒隔離啲朋友都可能講過話，即係考嗰個困難啦。噉就可能簡單到佢想做一個職業嘅司機，可能佢係想話去學車，學一個商用車噉樣，揾個識講英文。

107
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:24,020
嘅師傅都可能好睏難噉啊，所以對佢哋係選擇都已經有限。噉就算好似早前咧喺誒九龍西嗰邊都有啲誒小巴公司專登出曬廣告，話去請一啲誒願意請一啲男啊、女啊或者其他誒族類嘅司機啦，去揸小巴啦，咁都可能係比較即係個反應。

108
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:46,620
咁好多，其實佢哋最後可能就因為都係靠翻佢哋啲誒同鄉啊，或者朋友自己互相介紹，可能去，可能自己又稍為有少有多少少錢，可能就買架嗰啲誒好似貨van款嗰啲七人車噉樣啦。噉你尖沙咀綿登徑，你見到好多啲誒車嘅南亞裔嗰啲司機佢哋開，但係佢哋因

109
00:27:46,620 --> 00:28:06,630
因為嗰啲車其實又係我哋香港依家個嗰個交通嗰個法例又係過時啊，牌照佢哋出唔到出租車牌，其實全部佢哋都係被逼咧要遊走喺一個咧違法嘅邊緣啊，即係南亞鋭版嘅Uber嚟嘅嗰扎。但係咧，佢哋都係只係想揾餐食嘅。即係如果我哋除咗講緊話最基本，頭先其他朋友講過啲。

110
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,880
Thank you.

111
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,910
considered poor.

112
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,260
Thank you, Mr. Hussein.

113
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,560
公平嘅機會得到幫助。

114
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,690
services for ethnic minorities relative to local counterparts in 2016, among

115
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:46,300
of employment and been employed by labour department earlier. So what is the difference? How it is helping ethnic minorities to actually get better job?

116
00:33:46,590 --> 00:34:01,360
unemployment and available underpaid elementary jobs would continue to push em into this vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty. So to strengthen employment is a way forward to reduce poverty. Thank you, Chairman.

117
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:43,560
咁所以好希望咧，政府多啲明瞭解到，其實好多時好多唔同嘅政策都影響住佢哋。誒，不論係我我哋華裔嘅人，定甚至一般誒少數族裔喺我哋香港度生活，我哋都係香港人。希望政府多啲就係支援支援下佢哋，等佢哋學到好啲嘅廣誒，起碼溝通到嘅廣東話。

118
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:28,720
我叫瑪麗，係巴基斯坦人，少數族裔，都期望喺香港有美好嘅生活，但係我哋都話面到好多問題。首先，我哋揾工嗰時，老細唔知要我哋識廣東話，仲要識普通話，仲要識。

119
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:54,880
好努力學中文，識講，仲要識少少寫，都係揾唔到工。就算英文幾好，都冇用。又是因為畀人歧視，所以學有好多有好多唔公平嘅事。就算我哋有人大學畢業。

120
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:40,050
政府啲人都唔用翻譯都幫我哋，所以好多次我哋都唔知好多好重要嘅政府資源。政府應該提出一啲堅果是留予少數族裔嘅，需要令大家都可以有。

121
00:30:47,700 --> 00:31:07,710
Thank you, Miss Maya. We now invite Mr. Shaib Hussein, please, of the Dallas Prisoner Center for Workers Council. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The poverty line is drawn at the half half of the medium household income according to the household size. Those living below it are

122
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:29,200
since poverty is directly related to income and employment is one of the most significant factors that impact poverty situation of ethnic minorities, as mentioned earlier by some of the deputation, poverty is closely and directly linked to employment. Therefore, diverse employment services and opportunities are

123
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:49,210
vital for ethnic minorities to overcome poverty. Labour department claims to have enough, has done enough to help ethnic minorities in providing better employment opportunities, but figures from the labour and welfare bureau do not suggest this. As the labour department has been ineffective enough in provision of employment.

124
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:15,980
number of 63,814 registered job seeker at labour department 19.6% secured placement while among 1,043 EM registered job seekers only 7.86% secured placements. This successful rate of ethnic minority job seeker

125
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:35,990
Getting a job is even less than half of overall jobseekers' successful rate. Moreover, in two thousand sixteen, there were two thousand nine hundred seventy eight placements secured under the Placement Programme for Middle Aged, of which only twenty nine or zero point nine seven percent.

126
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:56,000
EM involved. These figures clearly indicate ineffectiveness of labour department in provision of employment service relatively to local counterparts in general population. If the government is really concerned about socio-economic well-being of ethnic minority residents, effective holistic

127
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:16,010
和 comprehensiv employment support for ethnic minority is needed, which is conducive to elevate their poverty. Better employment support can be achieved through setting up of EM selective placement division within the labour department, for which motion has been passed twice here from our legislator.

128
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:36,020
Council members and has been ignored by Labour Department continuously. Of course, Labour Department would mention that they will they have already hired two EM employment assistants. But some of our member mentioned that the duties of these EM employment assistants are more or less similar to the duties of those.

129
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,650
是cancel because of this miscommunication. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mrs. Sarah.

130
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:09,980
我現在 invite Mr. Abbas Syra of the Catholic Workers Centre Yamate。Thank you。

131
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,690
啲語言係冇興趣嘅，係梗冇興趣啦，唔想聽啦，因為聽到厭啦，因為已經好悶啦，已經係咪啊？

132
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:38,630
do so if we find that the front line staff did not proactively provide interpretation for those who have communication problem.

133
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:30,520
下午，實際上我 want to focus on ethnic minorities equal access to different government departments and also public services， as it is very important in order to solve generational poverty problem of ethnic minorities. In our previous experience with several ethnic minorities， we find that it was really difficult to access to student.

134
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:50,530
Finance Assistance Scheme, Public Housing Community Care Fund, Work Incentive Transport Subsidy Scheme, Food Bank, Low Income Working Family Allowance and other poverty relieving measures. They were not informed about these schemes and measures because of not having any or not enough promotion in their languages, or the process was quite complicated.

135
00:34:50,530 --> 00:35:10,540
And they cannot access to these services. Language barrier is the one of the biggest reason for inaccessibility. Why we always insist on interpretation service? Because it is the only way to solve the language problem. Because it is very difficult for ethnic minorities to learn Chinese, and it becomes more difficult for those housewives mostly staying at home and be.

136
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:30,550
busy in taking care of their families. Even they learn little English or Chinese, but it is not enough at all for understanding policies and poverty measures. It cannot help them to fill up the form and go through the complicated process. Hong Kong government already funded NGOs are providing interpretation services, so it should be used front line.

137
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:50,560
Staff should have proper training in dealing ethnic minorities, who are also important part of society. Experience showed that mostly staff is not aware of interpretation service or they don't know how to use it. The checklist of mayors of public housing and social welfare department stated that interpretation service will be arranged whenever necessary.

138
00:35:50,560 --> 00:36:10,570
但實際， front line staff always try to avoid it by saying that they do not know that how to use it, at what will be the procedures. If the client can speak just little English or Chinese, they think that it is enough for communication. But actually, it is not. So many misconceptions happens because of this. The guideline of Victoria

139
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:30,580
Saudi Arabian government on providing interpretation service, it states clearly which question they should ask to assess the client's language proficiency as well as the genuine needs of interpretation service. Even if the clients refused interpretation at the very beginning, the government should have no excuse to refuse to.

140
00:36:40,350 --> 00:37:00,360
There should be there should be direct hotlines to reach officers through through cheer interpretation service because present hotlines seems to be quite complicated and not only applicants but also when the officer want to communicate with the applicants they should they should also contact applicants through cheer interpretation service. It could reduce the chance.

141
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:20,370
cases of misunderstanding or wrong message delivery. In our past experience, especially for WITS, many applicants when they receive call from labour department regarding their application, they cannot communicate well. Maybe they do not have do not know English and Chinese are even they know the language, but they are not fluent enough. So what happen in many cases that the application

142
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:44,940
誒，We now invite Mr. Abdul Garfa Khan， please。誒，主席你好。誒，我首先想有個問題想問咧，其實呢個委員會係咪淨係得三位或者兩位議員嘅啫？因為頭先入到嚟咧就見到兩位議員喺度嘅啫，在座，跟住又多咗另外一位議員啦。噉啊，咁咪我覺得好奇怪，如果啲。

143
00:37:53,230 --> 00:38:13,240
誒，Mr.康，我唔想阻你嘅發言時間，不過咧，你要知道咧，議員咧好多時有好多會同而進行，亦都有啲議員咧喺樓上咧，佢哋會議室裏邊自己睇緊嘅，所以請你唔好介意我哋在席嘅議員咧，可能數字咧比較表面上少。其實我都介意嘅，唔好意思。咁另外咧，誒，唔緊要，我會爭取時間。另外一樣，我想問一問咧，就係話誒，今日誒在座嘅官。

144
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,820
期望撥款能夠用得其所。

145
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:20,150
因為好多時我哋都見到一啲個政黨啦，一啲嘅誒政客啦，佢哋好多時就係話成日將。

146
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:23,470
誒，即係要求，即係好似立法會已經之前通過咗有呢個誒勞工處嘅少數作業就作業就嘅就業科能夠有效嘅配對。

147
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:50,940
政府都係想趕絕呢班小眾族裔，唔想佢哋喺香港有個生存空間，踢走曬佢哋啦。跟住我請潘永樂先生，唔該，係唔該，主席。

148
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:40,800
第三，我哋歡迎即係有效政府，即係有系統檢視各公務員職係中英文書寫要求啦。噉我哋希望更多嘅部門，例如社署、勞工署、消防、民政、房屋署等等，能夠合理降低中文書寫要求，令我哋能夠加入公務員隊伍。

149
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:53,150
誒有好嘅教材，有好嘅語境先能夠學好中文。所以咧，要求即係EDB咧能夠專責增設即係誒中文作為第二語言嘅課程同埋教材。另外咧，亦都見到仍然好多學校有超過八九成都係啲小數族裔嚟嘅。我哋要求真係能夠。

150
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:33,250
員咧會唔會有回應咧？因為如果唔係嘅話咧，我哋每一次嚟到講一大堆嘢，跟住好似誒對住逢場講，跟住議員誒跟住咧到政府議員咧就話我哋冇嘢回應，好似上一次噉樣。咁如果係噉嘅，其實真係冇乜意思嘅喎。Anyway啦，唔緊要啦，我希望阿林鄭政府會鼓勵啲官員多啲。

151
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:53,260
去溝通啦，多啲去發言啦，係冇嚇，同埋有啲政策出台啦嚇。咁另嗱，我想講講咧，其實誒貧窮問題咧，尤其是喺南下瑞啊，或者係一啲啊少數族裔咧，係特別嚴重嘅。咁其實呢個問題點解會咁嚴重咧？咁其實究竟問題嘅根源喺邊度咧？其實政府係咪唔知咧？

152
00:38:53,260 --> 00:39:13,270
知嘅，我覺得冇理由唔知。我二十年內都唔知。咁仲有一問題啦。誒嗱，成日都喺度講嚟講去就話哦。誒，佢哋嘅學歷低，咁學歷低係咩理由咧？噉係咪係政府嘅教育措施造成嘅咧？噉我聽聞最近竟然話有啲幼兒園咧，到今時今日都係拒絕一啲啊少數族裔去入讀嘅。

153
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:33,280
咁呢啲係就係問題根源啦。咁當然你話佢哋可能個誒誒嗰個溝通能力嚇，佢哋嗰個語言能力冇咁強。咁其實呢個係藉口嚟嘅啫。如果我哋睇翻其他嘅國家好多地方，我哋一去到美國、英國啲機場，我哋好多時都見到會有唔同族裔人士。

154
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:53,290
而喺個機場度，包括由immigration開始去到誒銷售或者其他都有嘅。但係香港政府誒誒奇香港咧就好奇怪嘅地方嚟嘅。你去到咧就只可以見到係中國人嘅面孔，見唔到有其他族裔人士嘅面孔嘅。咁其實係咪佢哋真係完全唔適合做任何一種嘅工種咧？因為究竟係政府係。

155
00:39:53,290 --> 00:40:13,300
將佢標籤咗作為一啲只可以做一啲勞工嘅，或者係嗰啲嗯誒誒地地盤嘅噉，就所以就係標標籤曬佢哋。其實最大嘅問題咧就係話政府係帶頭係帶頭叫啲僱主唔好聘請一啲誒少數族裔人士，包括係南亞裔人士，因

156
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:40,490
所謂嘅假難民同埋一啲南亞裔人士溝溝埋一齊，其實我唔知佢係知唔知咩叫做香港人，乜嘢叫做假難民。其實如果佢哋噉樣都唔知，點當一個議員咧？我估我講嘅都係咁上下㗎啦。大家聽就聽到啦，聽唔到就算啦。再唔係嘅，不如趕住集，趕住曬呢班。

157
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,050
第六，誒。

158
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,180
所需嘅語文能力同埋技巧嘅。

159
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:59,400
唔該曬，潘先生。跟住我哋請平等機會委員會嘅何永強先生，唔該。

160
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,770
《是種族歧視條例》，令到政府唔能夠係豁免佢power and functions。好嘅，唔該。

161
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,230
下唔能夠避免，即係政即係避免政府誒能夠即係種族歧視合法化。

162
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:16,370
方案亦都向教師提供更多統一而且合適嘅教材同埋指引，同埋咧收集並且公開咧有關誒中小學非華語學生嘅數據，以確保唔同嘅自訓者咧可以作出研究嘅。

163
00:40:51,260 --> 00:41:11,270
誒就住新一屆政府嘅埋班咧，我想扼要回應，即係新特首參選政綱嗰六點支援少數族裔個政策方向。我相信誒間接或者直接同富貧有關。第一教育，我哋歡迎都非常關注檢討同埋改善而家中文作為第二語言加構嘅成效，希望。

164
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:34,150
希望呢個要求、呢個討論、呢個檢討咧方法咧，具透明同埋更廣泛性，包括更多團體嘅參與啦，有中學生代表啦，意見不記名，即係保障一啲資助嘅學校能夠暢所欲言啦，公開報告即係公眾能夠參與嘅。咁除咗即係我哋想想學好中文。

165
00:41:53,430 --> 00:42:13,440
誒喺收非華裔學生嘅比例設上限，有效減低種族隔離嘅現象。第二誒少我哋即係歡迎即係少數族裔即係誒加強嗰個就業支援啦嚇。咁原來法國只係得兩個即係少數族族裔嘅就業助理啫，我哋期望即係即係。

166
00:42:41,080 --> 00:43:01,090
第四，我哋歡迎亦都關注即係唔同即係政府能夠委任更多嘅少數族裔入呢個法定組織同埋委員會，但係唔想佢只係參考一兩個友好嘅團體嘅diversity list，希望包含唔同嘅族裔同埋階層，包括基層嘅聲音。第五，我哋歡迎都關注即係檢討。

167
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:21,100
《種族歧視條例》，誒，但係上屆咧，原來政府咧只係接受少部分、少收少補嘅建議，而我哋好希望即係今屆政府能夠真正係能夠與時並進，同其他三條法例看齊，係取消豁免政府嘅power and functions，誒，唔會唔能夠豁免。

168
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:49,340
公眾夠啦嚇，即係期望即係評議會能夠繼續或者更有效發揮社會監察同埋誒促進嘅角色，即係特別係主席能夠即係評議會主席啊，能夠即係公開譴責各種即係社會上一啲標籤嘅行為啦，誒同埋一啲歧視嘅行為啦，亦都係由説政府能夠喺新政府裏邊能夠係檢。

169
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:19,690
係你好，誒評議會喺六月十三日同埋今日都有意見書嘅。誒六月十三號咧，我哋嘅建議咧就係促請各政府部門、公用事業機構、公共交通公司同埋主要嘅公營機構咧，係作為佢呢啲作為佢規模嘅本地僱主咧，應該盡社會責任嘅，為少數就業人士提供更多嘅就業機會。

170
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:39,700
以起大頭嘅作用。咁可能嘅措施就包括咗咧，重新審審視佢哋嘅誒招聘嘅準則啦，特別係語言要求。誒，亦都可以咧引入誒在職嘅中文訓練或者係英語支援等等啦，幫助咧係少數族裔人士能夠達至入職、履行職責，甚至晉升所需嘅語。

171
00:44:42,460 --> 00:45:02,470
第二個建議咧，就係跟進本小組委員會咧喺二零一六二零一六年十二月十二日咧通過嘅動議嘅，係由教育局咧制定一套清晰同埋客觀嘅指標咧，係監測中國語文課程第二語言學習架構嘅成效。並且咧係應該有具透明度嘅誒，同埋係提出改善嘅方。

172
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:36,660
第三個建議咧，係誒採取有效嘅措施，向少數族裔嘅社羣傳達有關現有財政支援計劃嘅一啲資料，例如咧係以少數族裔嘅語文咧提供資訊，又或者咧係經由咧教育局咧作出協調，透過學校咧向少數族裔嘅學生同埋家長咧傳達有關嘅誒資助嘅資料嘅，咁喺。

173
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:56,670
喺今日嘅意見書裏邊咧，我哋就係誒集足會講呢個誒誒跨代嘅貧窮。咁喺二零一四年香港少數族裔人士貧窮情況報告裏邊都有提到咧，南亞裔嘅貧窮率係相對高嘅。咁巴基斯坦裔人士係高達五百分以上，五十個percent以上嘅。咁而有啲嘅不同嘅數據都反映咧，就誒。

174
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,540
summer classes or even extracurricular activities.

175
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,890
好曬真係，We now invite Ms Nagasutana Shakuwa, please.

176
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:35,360
要一個第二年嘅學習嘅誒課程啦，咁同埋係咪如果出咗小三、小四，係咪即係話教育其實都已經諗住小四以後就可以銜接到去主流嘅小五咧？如果唔係嘅話，點解冇一套有效同埋有系統嘅課程，等所有學校都可以去誒用嘅咧？

177
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:16,680
應考即係中學文憑試嘅非華裔學生，佢無論係喺嗰個誒考考誒呢個主流嘅中文科嘅比例啦，又或者係獲得誒取錄嘅比例咧，都係較低嘅。咁對於好大部分咧誒升唔到上大學或者誒大專嘅透過Jupus咧。

178
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:36,690
佢入讀本地嘅大學啦，而佢中文水平有咁低嘅話咧，好有機會咧。佢哋係重代入去咧呢個貧窮嘅情況裏邊嘅。噉我哋有三方面嘅建議嘅。第一個建議咧就係話應該要誒首收集咧有關誒跨代貧窮少數族裔裏邊嘅情況，評估下佢而家嘅誒狀況嘅。不

179
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:56,700
包括咗收集有關嘅資料啦，釐定咧一啲跨代貧窮嘅指標啦，同埋咧係識別一啲高危嘅因素。第二咧就係綜合翻而家咧既有嘅一啲資一啲零散嘅支援計劃，包括咗多元文化夢飛翔啦，又或者係展翅升建計劃咧，希望可以有一個長遠嘅跟進嘅輔導計劃。

180
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:16,710
話咧協助一啲離校生增進專業技能同埋經驗，從而咧係促使佢哋建立具前途同埋穩定嘅事業前景。我哋講埋最後一點，就係話喺一啲職業培訓方面，包括咗職業訓練局啦、誒僱員再培訓局啦，同埋誒呢一個嘅誒建造業議會裏邊嘅訓練咧，希望可以增加英語嘅課程。

181
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:36,720
或者英語嘅教材等，誒一啲嘅本地工人可以透過培訓咧，可以有個上流嘅機會嘅。唔該曬，唔該，學生。跟住我嚟請誒香港融樂會嘅張鳳美女士，唔該，唔該，主席。誒融樂會咧係關注少數族裔嘅兒童貧窮嘅問題啦。喺二零一四年少數族裔嘅貧窮情況報告裏邊指出咧，其實有小朋友嘅。

182
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:56,730
嘅誒南亞裔家庭嘅貧窮率咧，係比冇小朋友嘅咧係多咗三倍嘅。咁而且咧誒呢啲家庭嘅貧窮誒嘅貧窮住户咧誒嘅家庭人數比較大啦，而且都係年輕嘅一輩，同埋係誒好多都係在學年紀嘅。咁用一啲恆常現金支援嘅方法去針對貧窮嘅問題咧，其實唔係一個可持續嘅方法。

183
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:16,740
即係除非政府係覺得扶貧係有用啦，咁容樂會覺得咧，其實誒教育係重要脱貧嘅途徑啦。咁正話都聽過好多講中文嘅嘢，噉我都唔再講。其實中文真係一個好大嘅障礙。咁而家其實容樂會關注嘅咧，就係一班誒細路仔喺誒香港，無論係佢係出世啦，或者啱啱係即係喺香港誒就讀讀書。

184
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:36,750
由小學開始，嗰班小朋友咧係冇一個正確嘅誒課程咧，係啱佢哋為讀中文嘅。即係雖然政府咧係撥咗差唔多六億啦，而家講起即係誒呢三年裏邊咧，都聽到話架架構唔係好好啦。咁而誒教育局自己咧都誒曾經做咗一個嘅調查啦，統計咗大概。

185
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:56,760
係四百名嘅老師，咁八成以上嘅老師咧都係覺得咧，佢哋仲未掌握到呢個教學方式，已經係三年啦。即係點解唔係諗好咗先推出嚟嘅呢個架構？誒三年裏邊，教師而家回應嘅都係冇一個即係誒唔識點樣去教小朋友，或者咧係面對一啲缺乏誒教學資源，或者係不足支援。

186
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:16,770
嘅問題啊，咁而融樂會嘅觀察咧，亦都係見到一樣同一嘅情形。譬如我哋去到誒有啲小學噉，有啲學生係有能力嘅，或者佢因為由有轉開始就已經誒有呢一個嘅語境啦，噉佢有個誒好啲嘅中文中文嘅誒根基啦。咁但係好多先生咧就同我哋講，就算係一啲大學嘅支援或者。

187
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:36,780
或者係教育局嘅支援咧，幫佢哋編制嘅課程咧，其實係淺嘅。譬如係小一嘅課程咧，根本幼稚園可能係即係講緊nursery啱啱由幾個字學，但係咧呢一啲噉嘅課程咧係千篇一律，畀曬所有即係誒小一嘅學生。咁亦都有老師同我哋講，雖然講話呢個課程或者呢個架構咧係應該按住學生嘅需。

188
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,640
啊！

189
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,400
Thank you.

190
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,850
Thank you, Mr. Cool. We now invite Ms. Payo Besswals, please.

191
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,190
如果係任何其他 parent， 他們永遠唔會想把佢哋嘅子女喺呢啲學校， 係噉嘅態度。

192
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:45,680
They are either very rude in answering my questions, or they would ignore me. Some of the schools actually hang up on me as well.

193
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:15,300
Quite serious. So I would like to ask a question: Can the administration tell us what they are going to do to help the parents and the children?

194
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:16,770
Too many phone calls, and on the other hand, not every school is willing to give much information over the phone. Most of the time, they don't want to speak in English.

195
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:46,430
They face discouraging attitude from mainstream schools. Some school even tell them to go elsewhere to study, and because of this, parents end up putting their children in formal designated schools.

196
00:52:45,960 --> 00:53:05,350
I was told very nicely by one by a few schools that you should reconsider, go to other schools but not the Chinese schools. So I think this is very unreasonable. How the EDB is asking us to call and ask for information and how the school is reacting towards us.

197
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:26,880
我 felt that they have such assumption about non-Chinese kids and think that they will never be able to mingle or study among Chinese students. I feel that non non-Chinese kids are being looked down on by school. It seems like there's no use trying to find information or studying with the mainstream students.

198
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:56,790
需要而去教啦，咁但係有啲中三啊小三嘅同學仔咧，其實佢哋都仲未有小一嘅程度。咁乜嘢叫做按住學生嘅能力去教咧？佢已經去到小三，但係佢仲未有幼稚園嘅程度喎。咁另外我哋想提嘅咧就係話，嗯，我哋都聽到上一次嘅教育事務委員會咧，其實都有提過。

199
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:16,800
話會誒委託一啲誒高等嘅學院啦，同埋小學咧去協助做一啲小三小四嘅誒中文為誒第二語言嘅課程啦。噉我想問點解淨係得小三小四咁？其餘科係咪唔使咧？誒為我哋嚟講同埋一啲學者嚟講咧，即係我哋睇到啲研究報告咧，其實你由小一開始就需

200
00:50:42,200 --> 00:51:02,210
Good afternoon. My name is Nargis, and today I would like to talk about school choices for ethnic minority parents and parents' support. There is not enough support for non-Chinese parents with regard to making choices for their children, in selecting schools or looking for support. You name it: academic classes, tuition classes.

201
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:26,230
When choosing a primary school, most parents do not know the support provided by mainstream schools in their districts. Parents don't have a real or actual choice when they are choosing school for their children, because most of the information is in Chinese language. Be it school website, the information on the school website such as admis

202
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:46,240
mission dates, admission talks or even school leaflets. The only information they have is the school profiles, but the information on the school profile is very limited. It doesn't really list out the support for non-Chinese students. Parents don't doesn't really parents don't really know much about the school.

203
00:51:46,240 --> 00:52:06,250
EDB has said a number of times that parents can call up the schools and ask for information. But again, this is a very unreasonable request because you don't expect every single parent to call up every single school. This is going to pose a big problem for the school itself. They will be bombarded by

204
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:37,400
我試過打電話給五十間學校自己問更多資訊，從這次經驗中，我學到，我被他們的行為、態度所震驚，因為首先，他們不願意用英語和我溝通，而且大多數都不願意回答我的問題。

205
00:53:46,780 --> 00:54:06,790
One last point. Sure, go ahead, please. If if the editor over the phone is this bad, any parent will seriously will be worried, and they would never let their children study in these type of schools. The fear of your child getting bullied is because how the school is acting towards us, and the fear and the worry of the ethnic minority parents are.

206
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,090
在學校profile，謝謝。

207
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,990
工作嘅時候咧，原來都係會因為中文而揾唔到工。

208
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:05,320
唔識中文嘅讀寫，但係識聽説都已經可以做到嗰份工。咁勞工處就應該可以寫得清楚啲。

209
00:56:53,210 --> 00:57:01,060
話其實佢只要拎住GCS嘅中文，佢都可以達標；而GCS講緊嘅可能只不過係得華裔少一二嘅中文程度。

210
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:32,660
Thank you, Miss Miss Woods。誒，跟住我哋有請誒Society和Community Integration嘅卓文寶理事唔該。多謝主席。

211
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:39,330
我哋覺得對於已經大個咗唔可以再受惠於主流教育制度下嘅少數族裔咧，其實雖然佢哋嘅中文未必可以有可能中六嘅要求啊，又或者中六嘅程度噉樣啦，但係可能佢讀寫唔得，但係可能佢嘅聽説係O K嘅喎，咁所以咧其實。

212
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:22,480
做到個數字上好似多咗少數族裔入咗大學，就以為貧窮率就可以減低。但係其實政府更加應該注重對於土生土長嘅少數族裔學生嘅中文教育，等佢哋經過十二年免費教育之後畢業嘅時候都會有合適嘅中文水平，等佢真係可以融入到社會。

213
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:42,140
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to talk about parents' role in education. I think everyone agrees that parents' role in education is indispensable, and EM parents are no different. Every parent I meet care about the education of the child, but EM parents face various challenges when they want to get involved.

214
00:54:42,140 --> 00:55:02,150
to begin with, the parents are not aware about the education system in Hong Kong, especially when it comes to choosing schools. They want to choose a good school for their children, but due to language barrier, they cannot find much resources or information about mainstream schools. The government must bear in mind that many EM parents are not proficient in English or Chinese. Many parents have

215
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:22,160
教育背景， hence they do not know how to look for information on the internet or even fill in online application forms. Since parents don't know Chinese, it is very difficult for them to judge whether the children are good in Chinese. Sometimes they feel that since the child got 80% in Chinese exam, it means that the child is good in Chinese, but

216
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:42,170
The child is studying with the easier curriculum and the proficiency is not good. So there is no support for parents to understand this. Parents want to help the children in their studies, but because of language barrier, they are unable to do so. They heavily rely on tutorial services provided by the schools and the NGOs. These classes help students to complete.

217
00:55:42,170 --> 00:56:02,180
Homework only. These classes are not to supplement the Chinese learning. Most parents do not want their children to learn a lower level of Chinese. They want their children to learn adequate Chinese for them to integrate into society and for them to get a job which is according to their qualifications. Government should address these problems faced by EM parents.

218
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:22,190
more comprehensive school information should be provided to help facilitate school choice. Teachers and school staff should have mandatory cultural sensitivity training, which should which will help them to communicate well with EM parents. And there should be more transparency on the support measures which schools provide for EM parents. This should be listed.

219
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:53,210
喺扶貧委員會嘅報告第五頁咧都有講少數族裔其中一個貧窮嘅原因係因為好少，譬如巴基斯坦尼泊爾可以去到專上教育。而第廿七頁咧，佢哋就建議政府研究放寬透過D.S.C入大學嘅時候嘅中文要求。但係其實而家咧少數族裔其實如果用其他中文資歷都可以入大學嘅，即係。

220
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:21,430
我哋見過一啲新來港嘅小數族裔同學，其實佢只要用兩年都可以喺G C S C嗰度攞A Star，噉你就可以諗到佢嘅程度係有幾咁淺。而我哋見到好多，即使佢用呢啲其他中文資力入咗大專嘅小數族裔同學，可能因為大學課程好多都係用英文教，佢完成嗰啲大學課程係冇問題，但係當佢畢業出嚟揾工。

221
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:45,310
好多人都話，其實香港嘅中英文都係法定語言。如果你英文好，你就會揾到工㗎啦。但係其實現實上根本就唔係噉樣。除咗頭先與會者都講咗好多例子啦，另外咧，香港融和會有一個research係二零一六年嘅，佢哋嗰陣打電話畀一千五百個職位，其實一半都寫明佢哋需要有。

222
00:57:45,310 --> 00:58:05,320
中文溝通嘅能力。另外一半雖然佢冇寫明要中文溝通嘅能力，但係當佢哋再打電話去嘅時候咧，發覺其實得十二個percent係真係唔使中文，即係其他全部都係需要中文嘅。所以我哋覺得政府唔應該淨係着重放寬佢哋嘅中文程度，畀佢哋入到大學好似。

223
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:59,650
我哋覺得僱主上，如果佢寫緊一啲中文嘅學歷要求嘅時候，應該更加彈性。譬如佢要求中文嘅時候，其實勞工處應該有個角色去審視、瞭解或者建議僱主喺登求職廣告嘅時候寫清楚佢嘅中文要求，唔係一刀切話佢要識定係唔識中文，而係可能佢識中文嘅讀寫已經可以。

224
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:25,650
叫佢哋寫得清楚啲。另外咧，就係政府作為全港最大嘅僱主，我哋應覺得佢應該大頭聘請香港嘅少數族裔。譬如佢哋可以檢討每個部門同埋各個公告公務員職級嘅中文能力要求，包括入境處啦、警務處啦、消防啦、情教啦、緊急救護服務等等嘅服務咯。

225
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:45,660
我哋覺得而家雖然，譬如個別譬如警隊都請咗一兩個少數族裔，但係你都會諗到，譬如點解香港全港咁多少數族裔到而家都只係請到一兩個咧？其實政府可唔可以檢討下呢個中文嘅程度要求咧？多謝主席。唔該，卓女士。誒，請問政府代表有冇呢個階段有需要扼要嘅回應？就剛才語語委人士嘅發言。

226
00:59:45,660 --> 01:00:05,670
誒啊！多謝，係多謝主席。誒噉，我哋都好舉慶今日呢個少數委員會有個機會安排咗咁多嘅少數族類嘅團體嘅代表啦，嚟到呢度同我哋分享佢哋，譬如誒喺工作啊、求職啊，甚至係即係教育方面。主要我哋今日探討嘅就係嗰個少數族類嘅貧窮問題啦。

227
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:25,680
噉我哋其實咧，誒上一次嘅會議同埋即係我哋今次為咗準備呢個會，我哋交嘅文件裏面咧，其實即係都有提及即係少數族裔嘅一個貧窮問題嘅一個分析。噉我哋即係誒辦事處咧，就係即係誒我哋作為誒服務扶貧委員會啦。噉我哋喺扶貧委員會嘅範疇裏面咧。

228
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:45,690
即係當然係關注嗰個少數族裔貧窮嘅問題。噉我哋有誒定期有貧窮線嘅分析啦，亦都因應少數族裔咧，都係我哋誒委員會好關注一個一個特別有需要嘅社羣啊。噉啊，除咗大會以外咧，我哋亦都有個專責小組咧。咁為咗呢個專責小組可以即係有效即係進行佢嘅工作咧，我。

229
01:00:45,690 --> 01:01:05,700
我哋都做咗一啲誒特別係就住少數族裔嘅一啲貧窮問題嘅分析。噉我哋以往咧未有呢個誒貧窮線嘅分析框架之前咧，都主要靠嗰個誒五年一次或者十年一次嗰個人口普查啦。咁嗰度嗰啲數據咧都未必就係咁聚焦，可以睇到嗰個少數族裔嗰個情況啊。噉我哋。

230
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:25,710
因而咧，就係喺二零一四年，我哋有咗貧窮線嘅分析之後咧，我哋都即係誒做咗一個係比較針對性，係一啲有誒兒童嘅一啲少數族裔嘅家庭咧，我哋都做咗一個問卷嘅調查，因為比較專題性嘅。咁二零一六年嘅一個誒誒人中期人口。

231
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:45,720
普查嘅一啲數據咧，我哋都等緊嘅。咁希望嗰個都可以，我哋持續監察到少數族裔喺我哋誒唔同嘅政府範疇啊、服務啊、支援之下咧，嗰個情貧窮嘅情況有冇一個改善啦？噉我哋頭先都聽到好多位嘅誒一啲與會嘅誒代表咧，都同我哋反映咗少數族裔即係面對嗰個貧窮。

232
01:01:45,720 --> 01:02:05,730
問題嘅一啲主要成因噉，我都即係喺度都聽到。我諗其實即係我幾咁多位唔同嘅部門嘅同事啊，同埋政策局嘅同事都都嚟過呢個會，亦都有即係交流過嘅。噉我哋都睇到咧，其實大家都講到咧，即係要處理少數族類嗰個貧窮問題，甚至係跨代貧窮嘅問題咧，都要著重。

233
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:25,740
嗰個教育同埋就業兩方面啊，噉我哋呢個咧喺我哋扶貧委員會嗰個特別社羣專責小組都討論咗好多次，都即係因為噉樣咧，我哋都再做咗一啲特別嘅研究。咁誒，中文係一個重要嘅範疇啦。噉我哋都理解，即係如果喺香港生活土生土長咧，即係。

234
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,930
就誒。

235
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,130
執好啲嘢，係啲錢嚟嘅。

236
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:56,980
嘅啊資助咧，其實我哋同政府爭取咗好多年，一直到咧就係我哋上一屆立法會咧先至確實嘅。

237
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:45,750
如果要揾呢個工作、要求職、要有個即係誒上流嘅機會咧，即係要有個中文嘅掌握好重要。咁呢個教育局咧喺二零一四一五年我哋推出嗰個學習架構之後咧，都有一係列嘅唔同嘅一啲教材啊、支援啊，無論喺學校啦、誒誒或者喺學生方面咧，我哋都做咗好多。

238
01:02:45,750 --> 01:03:05,760
嘢嘅，咁當然大家都好關注嗰個成效啊！咁教育局咧都喺就住呢個架構嗰個誒實施之後咧，都有一個佢哋誒透過一啲比較專業或者大學誒嘅調查機構或者誒研究機構咧，我哋都做緊一啲數據分析，亦都睇緊嗰個成效。噉我哋初步聽到。

239
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:25,770
即係都行咗兩三年咧，嗰個誒對於一啲比較細年紀嗰個咧，個誒語文誒，無論寫啊或者即係講方面咧，嗰個誒進步會顯著一啲。但係我哋都要時間，因為學語文畢竟都唔係話可以好快，即係即刻學就即刻識噉。但係即係由細開始會更加好啦。

240
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:45,780
噉我哋誒再下一年二零一七一八年咧，我哋會有嗰個誒誒免費優質幼稚園教育嗰個誒新措施啦。咁裡面亦都即係誒就住即係幼稚園嗰個即係誒叫做少數族裔嗰個語文嗰個嘅支援咧，都有一個即係大嘅一個即係誒。

241
01:03:45,780 --> 01:04:05,790
叫支援同埋政策資源啦。噉我哋希望即係誒透過呢一啲比較由基礎開始做起嘅一啲誒支援服務咧，都可以幫到即係而家即即即係頭先大家都好講得啱嘅，就係即係土生土長呢一代咧。希望我哋都可以盡快透過嗰個教育嘅措施，令到佢哋可以融入噉就長大。

242
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:25,800
係一路喺香港，即係融入我哋社區，即係誒接受教育同埋將來就職咧，都會有一個即係比較好嘅一個發展啦。咁另外就求職方面咧，或者就業方面，頭先都講到好多勞工處方面嘅意見嘅。噉我都知道，即係之前呢個小組咧都有就住勞工處嘅服務啊，就業方面咧都有畀咗，即係都。

243
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:45,810
有一個交流同討論，噉我都即係明白，即係大家喺求職方面咧，接受到嗰個嘅誒支援咧，就希望可以到位啲啊。尤其是翻譯啊、揾工嗰個方面啦。噉我都知道，譬如頭先都有好多與會者講到咧，話即係有啲僱主其實即係嗰份工係咪即係真係要咁多，即係或者與

244
01:04:45,810 --> 01:05:05,820
語文嘅需求啊，中文嘅需求，我諗喺勞工處佢哋接受份工嘅時候咧，我都理解咧，佢哋係就業少數族裔比較合適嘅一啲工種咧，佢哋會做一個即係整合篩選嘅，咁亦都會有一啲特別針對少數族裔做嘅一啲誒招聘會啦，噉樣即係都做咗幾年㗎啦，噉我哋會持續做呢啲工作啦，噉。

245
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:25,830
咁都即係，畢竟咧，香港係一個比較華人聚居嘅地方，咁有好多工作要一個中文嘅要求咧，都有時係嗰個即係實際嘅需要嚟嘅。不過咧，即係如果有一啲工種，大家都講得啱嘅，即係唔係咁多要寫啊。如果講都溝通到嘅工咧，噉我都希望即係，譬如勞工署佢哋喺即係接受呢啲。

246
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:45,840
工種做嗰個即係誒誒叫做整合嘅時候都可以留意到咧，咁可以攞一啲比較容易啲係即係可以請到少少族類嘅工咧，可以即係做到一個比較針對性啲嘅一個援助啦。噉就誒，至於個翻譯服務咧，我哋民政事務總署咧，所以都有個即係誒佢哋。

247
01:05:45,840 --> 01:06:05,850
嘅一個特定嘅一個服務啦，咁誒個別部門譬如誒好似誒誒醫管局噉樣咧，佢哋嗰個用量比較多啦，同埋嗰個嗰個即係要嗰個要求翻譯嗰個即係專業嘅層面又比較強，佢哋即係個別部門自己都有特別嘅安排，但係即係我哋都希望喺而家譬如民政事務處佢哋做緊一個透過一個。

248
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:25,860
非政府機構嗰個服務咧，都聽到大家嘅意見咧。我哋都其實咧都關心嘅，因為喺我哋嗰個專責小組裡面咧，我都留意到咧，即係少數族類嘅支援咧，係需要即係用嗰個政府服務咧。我哋有時畀咧都係當然頭先講一視從同仁咧，其實我哋都希望無障礙嘅。咁喺呢個層面咧，我哋都做。

249
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:45,870
做緊一個比較誒叫深入嘅一個研究啦。希望咧，我哋喺一啲比較主要嘅一啲政府部門嘅一啲服務裡面咧，我哋都聽翻少少族類嘅意見啦，亦都同部門再去即係研究咧。希望可以喺提供服務嘅時候，點樣可以更加接觸到少少族類嘅社羣，或者嗰啲溝通嘅渠道，我哋要諗一諗啦。

250
01:06:45,870 --> 01:07:05,880
誒就噉，即係而家我哋好多部門都已經有一啲翻譯嘅服務啊，或者有啲單張，但係點樣可以真係幫到去到嗰啲屋企人嗰度咧？噉我都即係希望我哋跟住做嗰個研究咧，有一啲即係比較具體性嘅一啲誒措施咧，我哋可以即係同部門再研究喺嗰個扶貧委員會個層面再分。

251
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:25,890
分享咯，係。唔該，關女士。噉，既然我哋啊呢一節來到三點四十五分就已經夠鐘㗎啦。噉我哋當然我哋開始咗少少，我都盡量畀大家時間可以呢一節咧，就或者有啲交流咧。誒時間上可能要比較緊少少，希望大家唔好介意三分鐘到啊嘛。我哋誒之前有蔣麗雲啊議員舉手，有邊位委員想發言？

252
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:49,620
我哋盡快爭取啲時間啊嘛，就同電視機睇緊嘅嘅誒觀眾人士講聲。唔好意思，我哋會遲少少嚇，就先請啊蔣麗雲議員三分鐘，唔該。好啊，唔該啊，主席。主席咧就有關呢個中文咧，我哋民建聯一路咧就好關心。我諗咧就好多少數朋友都知道，就呢個中文。

253
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:17,270
咁咧當然我哋好希望睇到有成效，係真係有成效。噉啊，但係咧就嗯，即係我想，我啱啱都聽咗一啲朋友講啦，就則誒，即係即係唔止呢度嘅朋友，其實我喺誒誒呢個少數族裔嘅一啲社團活動當中咧，噉你亦都有好多少數族裔嘅。

254
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,630
心目中會唔會？

255
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,090
做工作嘅問題啦。

256
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,020
邊位政府代表作答？

257
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:50,070
即係嚟緊會響其他中心會再拼增加呢啲誒就業助理咧，唔該。

258
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,990
部分嘅quota係畀一啲叫做非華裔嘅香港市民咧。

259
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:09,040
啊，因為我知道好多地方係有嘅，嚇有啲可能兩個percent啊，三個percent啊，都有嘅。

260
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:52,520
咁咧就我哋好開開心聽到勞工處咧就即係已經招聘聘咗一啲少數族裔嘅助理去協助啲人揾工，但係我始終會認為咧政府因真係要認真諗一諗，我哋可唔可以定一立一？

261
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:25,940
嚇！即係我希望，因為我嗱，我知道政府而家喺隔離個總部咧，其實都有好多，我見到有少數族嘅職員喺度出出入入啦。咁咧，我希望咧，政府可以認真諗一諗嚇。唔該。好，我哋有機會先再一評回應嚇。誒，請潘少平議員計。

262
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:42,980
都係主席，就誒，當然咧，即係教育同就業係對解決小區聚居嗰個解決貧窮係一個好相當重要一個安排。咁其實我睇翻啲資料咧，其實而家嗰個小區聚居嗰個族羣裏面咧，即係。

263
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:35,360
OK，都要啊啊啊，都一定要佢哋take French，take French。噉啊，第二樣嘢咧，就政府咧就畀資助，畀一啲華人社區，叫佢哋自己去幫手搞啲補習班，由你哋自己啲Chinese去教你啲Chinese。

264
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:37,280
朋友就同我講話咧，就係真係有好多老師咧。其實佢哋嚇錢就攞咗，佢亦都可能會係啊攞嚟，或者係請咗啲保姆啊，或者點樣啊噉樣。咁咧就可能個用途你冇規範實，噉你變成嚟講咧就真係咧就啊達唔到嗰個效果。噉佢哋。

265
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:57,290
其實有好多家長亦都好擔擔心，見到啲小朋友中文好似個進步好慢啊！嚇，咁所以因此咧，我真係想咧認真咧，就係正視呢個情況，可唔可以誒學嗱？因為我咧誒讀書嗰陣時，我曾經喺誒誒加拿大誒誒Quebec Province嚇。

266
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:17,300
噉啊！嗰陣時咧就係要啊呢個啊French as呢一個啊second language。嗰陣時好似好難學啊，好難啊，特別係好多嗰啲華人嘅小朋友咧點學French啫？英文仲容易啲啦，係咪？French唔掂咁咧，就當時咧就做咗有一啲措施，就係compulsory。O.K.每一個學校。

267
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:55,650
嚇噉，所以我個問題就係可唔可以考慮有撥一啲資助畀一啲少數族裔嚇，即係佢哋或者已經大個咗嘅青年人，佢哋經歷過唔識講中文嘅階段，而佢哋學過，佢哋知道點樣學嚇。

268
01:09:55,650 --> 01:10:15,660
咁可唔可以係呢一個係一個短期嘅措施咧？咁而長期嘅措施嘅話，就好似啱啱有啲朋友咁講，因為佢哋亦都有嚟到啊教育事務委員會度反映過，就可唔可以真係有一個啊課程嘅係有系統嘅課程嚇？咁咧就真係有啲教材由。

269
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:35,670
由即係可能係由由由一年班一路到六年班嘅嚇，唔好淨係話小三小四，即係嚟又又又一年班一路直到去六年班得唔得咧？咁呢一個問題。另外第二個問題咧，就係有關將來少數族裔，我講好快好快好快嚇，少數族裔嗰個教育個唔係嗰個。

270
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:14,720
而家我哋。

271
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:33,240
跟住我哋請阿周鼎賢計。

272
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,050
關事。哦，好好，誒。

273
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:30,020
個針對在職家庭而誒嗰個負擔重、誒兒童多、人數多嘅情況，我哋就即係推出咗呢個在職誒低收入在職家庭津貼啦。噉佢哋都唔少嘅誒少數族裔嘅一啲家庭都能夠受惠嘅。

274
01:11:43,260 --> 01:12:03,270
巴基斯坦嗰個貧窮嗰個人數個比例相當之大，不過我唔知道政府有冇研究過，佢個主要係咪佢嗰個家族即係人多，即係細路仔多，噉佢要即係承擔個責任重啦，咁而可能佢出嚟就業亦都係相對困難，因為要有人睇住啲細路仔。

275
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:23,330
噉我唔知有冇做呢啲特別嘅，即係針對，因為呢個組羣族羣裏面嗰個貧窮人數個量咁大，呢個咧就即係會唔會特別會有啲政策咧去幫佢哋，包括即係兒童個照顧嗰個嗰個考慮。咁另外咧，正話都有提到咧，就話嗰個勞工處咧就喺呢個西九龍個就業中心。

276
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:43,340
咧就請兩個即係懂得少少俗語嘅語言嘅就助理啦。噉就誒由五月開始啦。咁即係換句説話咧，做咗個零月啦。咁唔知而家嗰個個成效點？我主要想了解下咧，就係即係其實嗰兩個朋友嗰個語言啊，所謂精通少少俗語係主要係咩語言？另外咧，即係其實老公説。

277
01:12:55,750 --> 01:13:15,760
主席多謝噉就頭先阿潘議員提到嗰個關於巴基斯坦嗰個分析咧，噉我哋喺嗰個二零一四年咧，我哋嗰個關於一個誒叫做有誒兒童嘅一個即係誒少數族裔家庭嗰個專題嘅調查裏面咧，我都見到咧巴基斯坦即係嗰個貧窮咧係相對即係真的確係比較高。

278
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:35,770
噉我哋睇到咧，即係巴基斯坦嗰個誒家庭咧，嗰個貧窮原因比較高咯。我都睇翻佢嘅特性啦。第一樣真係小朋友比較多啲嘅，第一，第二咧就係佢哋女性出嚟就業嗰個比率又特別低嘅，喺即係其他就算即係喺幾個唔同嘅一個誒少數族裔族羣裡面咧，都係比較即係但係偏低嘅，特別即係。

279
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:55,780
可能佢哋即係嗰個嘅文化背景嘅問題啦。噉，所以我諗呢兩個一個即係佢哋嗰個文化背景咧，都令到佢哋咧係比其他即係即使貧窮嘅小到族類，佢嘅情況都會差啲。噉我哋都見到咧，佢哋即使做嘢咧，個男性咧都係一個人，佢哋一點一個人，即係喺平均一個家庭裡面係即係。

280
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:15,790
有工作嘅噉啊，要即係承擔起成即係平均成四五個人嘅一個即係屋企嘅負擔係比較重嘅。咁所以一個人即使佢哋嗰個家庭人數咁多，即使努力工作咧，都未必脱到貧啊。咁所以我哋正正都呢個都係一個我哋見到嘅現象啦。噉我哋睇到咧就係誒呢個。

281
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:53,810
誒唔該，主席，噉就誒想跟進翻嗰個中文作為第二語言嗰個教學方面嘅問題嘅。咁其實過去咧喺呢個panel咧，我哋唔同嘅同事啦，或者與會者咧都多翻提誒，大家係需要誒，唔單止係學習嘅支援啦，嗰個對於。

282
01:14:53,810 --> 01:15:13,820
嗰個標準嘅學習課程咧，大家都係一路有一個個訴求喺裡面嘅。當然啦，即係教育局嘅同事咧，誒，即係過去我哋經驗掌握到咧，就好多時佢都話：誒，而家唔係冇指引，已經有一啲嘅方式去處理呢個嘅問題。咁但係又的而且確咧，每一

283
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:33,830
似你嚟聽會，或者你聽到啲同事即係嚟參與開會嘅同事，亦都講得好清楚，就係而家睇嚟嗰個嘅指引都未必係好足夠。佢哋真係可能好希望有一種比較標準嘅統一嘅課程，或者有一個真係基本嘅概念去支援嗰啲先生，係支援啲先生，因為咧老。

284
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:53,840
老實講，而家老師如果得唔到支援，導致到佢哋教中文作為第二語言嘅技能或者嗰個能力受到影響咧，將來呢班少數族裔嘅誒小朋友咧，佢受到嘅教育又會受到影響。咁所以誒喺呢方面咧，我都好希望即係隨住新一屆政府。

285
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:13,850
咧都再希望即係啊各方能夠再考慮，或者即係睇下呢一方面嘅支援會唔會有啊多啲嘅統一嘅標準、標準嘅課程可以安排畀出嚟，特別係支援到老師。咁另外一樣嘢咧就係講嗰個誒，今日好多與會者都講到嗰個就業嘅問題啦。咁其實咧過去咧。

286
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:24,670
南亞裔人畀做假難民咧？

287
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:57,910
係講係整體社會上嘅印象。

288
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:35,430
唔好聽完就走咗去，而第二咧就係。

289
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:03,130
誒，我哋喺我哋嗰個工作範疇裏面，我哋絕對冇噉樣做，係。

290
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:34,530
你哋冇得講嘅嚇，呢啲政黨嘅事，但係政府真係有冇噉樣嘅誒？你回應下誒，你回應下，Mr.康。

291
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:47,690
咁唔得咯，用咗成六億，搞咗成三年，都係而家我哋睇嚟睇去係真係唔係幾work㗎嘛？即係唔該啦嚇，呢個係誒。

292
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:21,330
專業社工係誒少數族裔人士嚟㗎啦，喺尖沙咀啊啊，直情畀警察截停啊，就問佢攞行街紙嚟睇。嗱，政黨啊有意無意地將啊～

293
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:50,490
呢方面咧，能夠令到嗰啲企業係得到一種認同咧，係幫助到佢哋，又幫助到做做嘢。噉我意見係噉嘅。唔該，主席。好啊，我哋誒主要係意見啦，有機會先再請嗱嗱代表回應。誒，跟住我哋請阿毛孟靜議員，唔該。

294
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:35,010
啊誒喺呢個panel呢個小組裏面咧，都提及過好多次。誒有一啲嘅政府部門，包括紀律部隊，就話畀我哋聽咧，佢哋已經即係盡量對於個某一啲嘅中文嘅要求，佢已經放寬咗，希望能夠吸納到少數族裔嘅誒職工。咁但係咧睇嚟咧都誒未係話好足夠啦，即係。

295
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:55,020
嗰個就業嘅問題，同埋要解決真係嗰個貧窮嘅問題。我自己就有兩點意見嘅。第一咧就係求先阿蔣麗雲議員提嗰個百分比嘅諗法啦，即係會唔會喺即係鼓勵至少係一種鼓勵嘅模式，去鼓勵啲企業採取呢種百分比嘅模式去考慮聘請一定百分比嘅小業族裔。

296
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:15,030
嘅人士咧，咁呢個第一第一個諗法啦。第二個諗法咧就係會唔會對於嗰啲企業為咗鼓勵佢哋能夠多啲聘請少數族裔嘅人士咧？啊，如果佢哋係能夠可能係達到某啲嘅指標，或者真係話到畀人聽係比較積極去聘請少數族裔，唔係話一日。

297
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:35,040
哦，即係唔係話一段好短嘅時間霎時間請一個就話係係一段比較長嘅時間裏邊都做到嘅話咧，呢啲企業會唔會佢即係可能有一個優質嘅標籤又好，或者話畀畀人哋聽，喂佢真係有負擔起呢種唔單止係社會責任，亦都係促進緊社會嗰個共融。噉我覺得即係呢。

298
01:17:51,710 --> 01:18:11,720
啊！有一點係非常諷刺嘅咧，就我哋建造業成日話唔夠工人啊嘛，要輸入外勞，但係好多南亞裔嘅啊，我哋嘅年輕人啊，尤其是就冇工翻。噉我希望評議會嘅提議嚇係最實在嘅，就係話唔該你職業訓練局嗰啲課程。

299
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:31,730
情啦、三行啊、地盤工啊嗰啲，你加多啲英文嘅課程啦。我真係有啊，離譜嘢嘅年輕人上過嚟誒同我投訴，就話去上堂咧，以為嚇學泥水啊，喂，全部中文喂，佢真係講講下都唔知講咩噉。呢個唔該嚇，真係。

300
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:55,990
我當然唔係指誒誒行政長官辦公室嘅誒誒呢個代表嚇誒就誒你你講説話不盡不實，我冇咁意思嚇。但係我擔心咧，就會唔會政府人員咧，政府畀嘅數據咧，永遠係報喜不報憂嘅，講嘅就係學中文嗰。

301
01:18:55,990 --> 01:19:16,000
喂，我哋有融樂會啊，張小姐啊，然後我哋有誒Society for Community Integration啊，卓小姐講嚟講去就係話你而家嗰個咩學中文嘅什麼架構好淺啊，真係淺到咧就學一陣咧已經攞誒G C S E A。

302
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:36,010
但佢出嚟係揾唔到工嘅。呢啲小學一二年級嘅中文對佢嘅前途係冇意義嘅咯。所以佢哋講一套，你哋講一套，話啊都幾好喎。而家都有成效，而學語文咧就係一生一世嘅事，又唔係話啊好快啊一定可以睇到幾好嘅噉。

303
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:39,070
希望咧，家長咧能夠睇到。

304
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,760
三個問題咯。好啊，先請誒葉女士答咗第三問題先啦，其他之前嘅兩個可能係啲意見多啲嚇。

305
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:10,160
誒時間關係，或者我哋整轉頭先整體一齊回應啊！如果需要嘅話，誒跟住我哋請朱開地議員，唔該。

306
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:29,230
係，或者好簡單誒？請回應關於嗰個入境處嗰個指南同埋嗰個統一嘅翻譯嗰度有冇回應？因為剛才啲問題都可以牽涉到呢一度嘅。唔該，主席。誒，我請我民政事務總署嘅阿鄭先生。

307
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:15,100
有冇啲主動去幫呢啲少數族裔家長去幫佢哋？咁如果就住選校嗰度嘅時候咧，我哋每年咧都係有選校講座，而個選校講座咧，我哋亦都會提供咧係即時服務、即時翻譯服務嘅。

308
01:19:48,130 --> 01:20:08,140
我嘅第二點啊，我亦都希望咧就誒政府方面可以回應下啊，Mr. Khan嗰個誒allegation就話唔單止係政黨係政府啊，動不動咧就將南亞裔嘅香港人咧係等同啲假難民，有意無意地咁事實係我有。

309
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:54,820
或者請簡單回應啊。係啊，誒，我都即係聽到阿Mr. Kenneth講，我都覺得我就喺我哋喺我工作或者喺我哋而家講緊扶貧呢樣嘢咧，我哋絕對冇呢個即係標籤啊，或者即係叫邊啲人等於咩人。我哋主要就係睇嗰個需要啦。噉我哋唔係講扶貧啊。

310
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:30,520
係唔該，主席，我有三個簡單嘅問題嘅噉就因為誒政務司誒辦公室有人喺度咧，就頭先其實聽到好多位與會者都講到嗰個資訊不足嘅問題，即係話就算有啲服務佢哋都唔知道噉樣咁誒，我諗。

311
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:50,530
誒少數族裔人士佢第一步嚟到香港咧，就係誒接觸嘅可能係入境處啦。咁入境處可唔可以確保誒，即係由民政局去印嘅嗰個給少數族裔人士的服務指南咧？係入境處係確保所有誒入境嘅少數族裔。

312
01:21:50,530 --> 01:22:10,540
無論佢係咪長期居留咧，都可以人手一本嘅。呢個第一個問題啦。第二個問題就係翻譯嗰度咧，我哋其實誒呢個小組委員會講得好多次嘅，即係每一個部門咧都有自己去諗嗰個翻譯問題點樣做，但係就冇統籌嘅。咁政務司可唔可以諗一諗，即係話有一個關於？

313
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:30,550
少數族裔翻譯嘅統籌嘅辦事處，噉你就由醫學誒由醫療啊，到到房屋啊，到到福利就一一次過搞掂曬佢啦。咁第三咧就係誒教育嗰度咧，我想問翻阿葉女士嘅，因為頭先誒第十八號講者咧，阿Miss Shaqul。

314
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:50,560
咧，佢提到即係話，佢作為一個家長咧，佢係要主動噉樣去逐間學校噉樣去拍門去問到底佢嘅小朋友會唔會係被即係取錄，咁而唔係有誒教育局會幫到手噉樣。咁點解會有呢個情況出現咧？三

315
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:16,050
誒多謝主席。誒簡單啲講嘅時候咧，即係如果喺家長選考度咧，為非華語嘅同學咧，我哋對佢嘅幫誒協助嘅時候咧，我哋本學校概攬咧，影請學校咧係提供英文嘅版本，咁亦都係咧每年咧都需要咧優化。

316
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:58,450
報名。

317
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,240
攞唔到咩實質？

318
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,280
今日都係畀人又蝦住。

319
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,780
係，多謝你。

320
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,310
我哋誒或者休息五分鐘，我哋馬上開始好。

321
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:46,750
公眾人士等太耐咧，我恐我恐怕我哋要喺度停一停啦。噉就多謝曬咁多位議員人士，特別啊，在在有啲係曾經寫信嚟支持，話希望呢個委員會繼續多過一年嘅咧，你哋已經啊成功爭取到㗎啦嚇。噉啊，咁有機會我哋再多啲機會溝通下、交流下。唔該曬三位，thanks very much。

322
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:36,060
啊！佢哋嘅內容咁誒，我哋最近咧亦都同學校咧，大家一齊傾咗咧。咁其實學校喺呢方面咧，都好想咧係協助得到咧，就係少數族裔嘅家長㗎。噉佢哋都會咧喺嗰個即係學校概覽方面咧，係提供一啲多啲嘅資料，好希。

323
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:59,580
學校誒提供嘅資料嘅時候咧，更加能夠深入去理解。噉就住喺呢度嘅時候咧，咁學校每時每刻其實因為佢哋係弱勢社羣，佢哋係期望政府教育局幫佢哋，唔係話即係話學校個別噉樣提供多啲資訊嗰個環節咯。佢哋想教育局做啊嘛。

324
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:49,540
誒多謝主席，係咁誒現時咧就民政事務總署就統籌一本嘅誒生活指南嘅，噉就係以英文同埋六種嘅少數族裔語言出版嘅。噉我哋其實每一次出版嘅時候，我哋都會問翻各個政府部門去update翻，即係佢哋提供嘅。

325
01:24:49,540 --> 01:25:09,550
資料啦，咁同埋裏邊亦都有一啲即係關於公共服務嘅信息嘅。咁而依一本嘅指南咧，就我哋喺機場嘅入境處嘅櫃位嗰度派發。咁而我哋誒最近咧，亦都即係同咗入境處係安排咗喺所有入境處嘅office咧，亦都會係有。

326
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:29,560
每一啲嘅生活指南去派派發嘅嚇，好啊，統一翻譯嗰度咧，有冇誒呢個誒建議？我哋翻去睇考慮，因為都我都有其他渠道都有聽過呢一方面嘅意見嚇。我哋可以喺個研究之後，我哋同相關部門研究下。好唔該，唔該曬。為咗唔想跟住第二節嘅。
