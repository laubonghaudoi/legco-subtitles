00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:48,540
啊！一切選舉嘅活動，例如幫誒見候選人啊，或者去幫候選人做宣傳嘅。

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:53,100
We decided from tomorrow until the results of the C elections being announced during that period that.

13
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:22,790
特首選舉期間咧，啊，對所有候選人公平起見咧，啊，大樓嘅設施咧係公共嘅資源，咁咧我哋就會。

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:39,750
覺得咧，即係對於個選候選人咧，佢如果利用咗一個公共資源咧，其實佢自己要小心嘅，因為依個會係會唔會觸犯選舉條例咧？噉佢自己係要自己負責嘅。

15
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:39,050
唔希望咧係用喺競選活動裏邊，噉我哋決定咧喺行政長官選舉提名期開始，即係由聽日開始，直到有選舉結果嘅期間咧，係大樓係禁止。

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:01:08,860
咁行管會咧就會透過秘書處咧就發出指引畀啊各議員，咁希望議員係自律嘅。咁如果違反呢個情形咧啊，秘書處咧就會向有關嘅議員咧係發出警告，咁亦都會將個副本咧。

17
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,060

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,810
誒。

21
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,170
你哋喺度講緊。

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,290
回應上次的選舉。

23
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,700
to the advantage of

24
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,250
誒話畀佢聽，佢哋要小心嘅。

25
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,640
法例，咁依個都係一個善意嘅。

26
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,420
時間咧，我哋係勸喻啊，亦都係禁止啊。

27
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,930
要額外小心啊！唔好誤墮依個即係。

28
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,780
咁但係主席你話幫威為咗威都要小心，咁但係如果佢哋真係咁做，噉你會唔會誒畀warning佢哋？

29
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:47,690
啲候選人咧，利用立法會依個公共資源咧，係進行競選嘅活動。但係，喺現今嚟講，

30
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:33,860
誒，我頭先講咗咧，我哋係由聽日開始一個提名期，至到直至選舉有誒結果之。

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:35,460
no we we we are not going to write to the election office but we are just giving guidelines to electoral members that you know they should be fain from using it so as the public seen as electioneering you know for the C

32
00:02:43,060 --> 00:03:03,070
我諗呢一個咧係一個指引嚟嘅嚇。噉啊，其實要用到麥兜要做到呢樣嘢咧啊，其實係一個選舉委員會去睇嘅事。咁所以我哋係勸喻啊，我哋嘅同事啊，尤其是有啲同事啊會參選嘅咧，係要。

33
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,010
O.K. 好，唔該曬。

34
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,210
We will give them a warning letter.

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,260
會有咩後果呢？如果律師們 decides to go against

36
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:34,860
嚇，咁如果有投訴，有人投訴或者點樣咧？依一個係要選舉委員會或者係廉政公署去跟進嘅。

37
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:25,430
咁但係，梁保嚴格嚟講，佢即係話自己係備選，而佢真係未係參選，因為佢都話要夠三萬七嘅提名先至參選。噉啊嗱，依一個係唔係我執法嘅？

38
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:15,080
But then we'll CC copy to the Election Commission and also ICAC, so they have to bear the consequences of if they contravene any election, you know, law.
