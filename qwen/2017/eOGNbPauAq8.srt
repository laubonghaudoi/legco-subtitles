1
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,620
主席。

2
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,100
請你就議案發言。

3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,190
指數調整三項嘅收費啫。

4
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,050
我想提醒議員。

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,200
我會請誒鄺俊宇議員先發言。

6
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,180
有意發言嘅議員咧，亦都請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。

7
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,710
議員咧係不應提出與議題無關嘅事宜。黃俊裕議員，你？

8
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:14,150
討論而已決議案嘅具體內容，包括係費用嘅變動，甚至係擴展至討論整個發還制度。

9
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:36,410
呢一個嘅議案嘅背景咧，大家知道會兩年檢討一次，按呢個丙類消費物價指數去調整呢一個嘅費用。

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:01:03,690
由於鄺俊宇議員提出咗終止代續議案，本會現在要先處理呢一行嘅議案。

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:48,380
你有冇新嘅論點？主席，OK，主席，我正正係想講，如果因應住只係物價指數嚟調整呢個不恰當嘅，主席，而家我引用議事規則四十括弧一，要求終止待續呢個議案。

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,370
在區議員去做唔同嘅案件嘅時間，一啲嘅草根階層，佢哋遇到官非嘅時間，嗰種嘅焦急，所以我先係闡述出嚟。再次指出，而且對你提出最後我明白，主席警告啦，因為咧。

13
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:33,660
每一位議員不需要將佢個人經歷咧喺辯論裏邊咧係提出，誒你嘅論點若然被其他議員早前已經提述咧，你不應該再提出；若然要提出，亦都應該儘量精簡，因為今次嘅議議決議案內容非常簡單，就係按消費物價。

14
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,390
二零一六年，二萬五千零九十六位市民。

15
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:59,660
每小時一千五百三十蚊加到二千三百蚊，都做咗啦。律師嘅刑事法律援助費都做咗呢一個嘅上調二十五個percent，每個鐘頭八百蚊加到一千蚊。

16
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:08,350
做一個檢討嘅話，唔趁而家去做一次嘅話，放過佢之後，一百年咪又翻嚟咯。跟住又會同你講我當其時嘅丙類物價指數係點樣加嘅，然後我哋就繼續見到當值律師唔多人。

17
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:24,900
啲啲啊，亦都唔係淨係錢嘅問題啊，而係同步地檢討點樣令到個服務走進民間啊！香港法律面前人人平等，而唔係話有錢就越能夠玩法律啊！

18
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:32,310
你已經個人已經驚㗎啦！你畀人拉嘅時間，你遇到呢啲嘅事嘅時間，如果你係冤枉嘅話，如果我哋呢度唔能夠喺呢個檢討裏邊做得更好嘅話，就更多冤獄。你可以話嗰啲冤獄唔係好大嘅啫，裁判法院都唔係太大，唔係㗎。

19
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:44,400
嗰個問題係唔係淨係四個percent嘅問題嗎？嗰個問題係令到當身陷呢個嘅官非嘅市民，佢真係要用嘅時間，原來只不過係九點去到法庭，十點開庭，十分鐘時間同當事律師去展訊嗰件事，做一日都唔得。

20
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:15,350
呢啲數好似好細，但係大家諗諗，如果你係草根階層長大，你遇到呢件事嘅時間，你唔識㗎，你係唔識㗎，你要揾人幫手㗎。我哋而家幫你咩時候啊？民政處嘅法律諮詢服務等幾耐？等六個禮拜，六個禮拜見你半個鐘頭。

21
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:28,260
喂！呢個呢個嘅需求咁大嘅時間，我哋喺呢個時間去唯一一個機會，就係喺呢一類都係有調整、有檢討嘅時間。我哋係就係喺個檢討裏邊去納入真係喺市民民間用不著、唔知點算好嘅時間，一啲灰色地帶得以修整。

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:44,330
刑事訴訟程序條例而議決議案嘅主旨係參照丙類消費物價指數嘅變動，將代表法援處處理刑事訴訟工作嘅大律師同埋律師費用有關嘅檢控費用同埋當值律師費用均。

23
00:01:44,330 --> 00:02:04,340
調高四個百分點，而家鄺議員咧係要求提出終止待續嘅議案，議題其實係好窄嘅。大家係咪支持係將而議嘅決議案辯論終止待續？請議員咧不應該利用呢一項辯論咧係再次係。

24
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:56,720
喺咁多位同事嘅發言裏邊都好清楚展示一件事，我唔復述，就係呢一個係同市場脱歐，唔能夠反映市場。好啦，你會話既然係噉，你畀佢檢討咗先啦，兩年再翻嚟。我哋經已係由九二年開始一直噉樣反覆嘅檢討，就係根據消。

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:16,730
消費物價指數，而冇去透過呢個檢討做一個真真正正嘅檢討。真真正正嘅檢討就係要問喺電視機面前一個小市民，如果係不幸真係抵觸到法律，遇到法律上嘅問題嘅時間，佢如何係透過我哋喺呢一個議事庭去能夠提供嘅一個。

26
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:36,740
嘅資源，起碼要畀當事律師法律援助等等，係令到市民更加容易使用到，更加容易受到呢一個法律面前人人平等嘅原則之下得到保護。所以你話點解要喺呢個時間要展述背景有原因嘅？因為假如我哋今日輕易放過，唔好。

27
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:56,750
好快就到兩年之後，兩年之後就再到兩年之後，呢個係唔係真係大家樂見呢？呢一個時間，寧願喺度能夠去增加多啲嘅意見，去迫使政府痛定思痛，去檢討整個嘅制度係一個非常之適合嘅時間。因為如果我哋而家唔離新理。

28
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:29,160
跟住繼續有參差嘅服務，有啲好有心嘅律師想嚟幫手，但係個制度上咧就唔係咁容易可以令到嗰個服務到位。我哋睇翻主席點解要喺呢個時間做咧？因為呢個時間其實老實講，如果我要加呢個四percent，冇人會阻止，當然冇啦。但係個問題就係加得唔夠嘛。

29
00:04:44,740 --> 00:05:04,750
噉係咪一個真係唔能夠可以喺呢個時間作出檢討，或者加入去納入政府去檢討，令到之後可以越做越好嘅制度咧？我真係唔明白，主席。我係睇翻個數字，二零一五年，我哋香港當值律師服務計劃係服務咗二萬六千六百三十四位人兄。

30
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,300
同埋影響成個司法系統嘅運作。

31
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,860
當嗰個要正式落案去告呢個嘅。

32
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,240
我哋唔知，但係事實上不能否認嘅就係眼前嘅資源係嚴重不足，而一直都唔肯去做改革。

33
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,920
如果你要講大嘅，《基本法》第二十五條已經講明香港嘅居民喺法律面前一律平等，但喺實踐嘅時間，究竟我哋係咪真係平等咧？

34
00:07:45,190 --> 00:08:04,310
呢啲嘅法律嘅中心咧，係透過集體購買專業嘅保險嚟減輕NGO同埋義務律師嘅負擔。澳洲做到，美國咧，美國而家講緊嘅，佢個每個律師會有一個致力完成至少每年五十小時嘅義務法律工作。呢個係一個美國嘅律師協會嘅規範嚟。

35
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:57,520
有錢唔使煩請律師，冇錢法律援助要等幾耐？我哋睇翻各區啊，嗰個嘅民政事務處淨係要嗰個免費法律諮詢服務。我唔講咁多，我有九個我唔讀出嚟，我一淨係講一兩個。中西區要等二零一六年要等六點三個星期，東區要等五點九個星期。

36
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:48,550
但係，主席你就話啦：啊，呢個咧就唔係嘅，呢個咧可能有其他同事展述咗啦，等等啲嘅。但係，我哋睇翻個事實，如果我哋呢個時間做檢討嘅時間都唔檢討緊，等幾時咧？我哋睇翻喺呢個嘅立法會舊年通過大律師嘅刑事法律援助費用增加咗五十個percent，費用有。

37
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:52,620
有啲可能真係，如果係及時有一個嘅法律嘅服務援助，可以提早進入到嗰件事，可以令到佢更加早啲掌握到嗰個支援嘅話，會唔會有一個結果嘅改寫咧？我唔講得遠啦，主席，我講一講二零一五年美林村謀殺案，警方一度誤控一位智障嘅男子誤殺。

38
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:12,630
事件中多名警員係遭處分，呢條案件係反映精神病患者冇能力或者未能表達自己特顯，需要法律援助。你會話咁呢個關唔關今日嘅時間關啦？今日嘅就係檢討緊佢嘅收費上升嘛？喺呢個時間，緊係希望能夠攞呢啲嘅事件去令到局方去要求嘅，唔係淨係加。

39
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:45,190
我唔明白點解喺呢個時間，當我哋見得到外國做得越嚟越好嘅時間，起碼外國我哋見到澳洲有二百幾個社區嘅法律中心，政府係有份出資㗎，由熟識受助社羣嘅NGO經營運，而無律師係透過呢個制度同埋接受業內嘅培訓，確保業務法律嘅質素。

40
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:24,680
香港而家就係講心，有唔少律師其實佢哋都想幫手嘅。你睇翻嗰個當值律師名單千二位裏邊的，而且佢有唔少有心嘅律師喺我分享我經歷裏邊，我都遇到一位。但係問題係，當一年又一年只係透過消費物價指數去檢討嘅時間問心，如果市民遇到官非，請問？

41
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:44,690
佢係咪可以用而家嘅制度可以獲得一個絕對嘅保障？唔係三催四請還押嘅時間都唔能夠攞到法律服務，去到上庭前嗰刻先能夠用當地律師。呢個係咪真係我哋落見？我哋睇翻而家最大嘅對最大最大嘅問題喺邊咧？最大嘅問題，我哋見得到當呢個嘅被扣留嘅時間，尤其是。

42
00:08:49,140 --> 00:09:09,150
人事嘅時間，即警署到出庭嘅時間，嗰個係一個非常之大嘅空白。呢個時段咧係一直冇進入討論。你會話呢個可唔可以翻司法嗰個panel傾？可以，但係個問題係，如果喺呢個大會裏邊到到而家呢一個已經按兩年一次一度嘅檢討，虛做嘅時間。

43
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:29,160
我就更加希望，我哋希望佢下一次交嘅功課唔係淨係講話根據嗰個嘅消費物價指數啊。呢個唔能夠令到我哋遇到一啲嘅案件、一啲嘅冤獄發生咗。我哋已經係見到好多㗎啦。我哋係希望喺呢度作出一個真正嘅檢討。你睇翻其實。

44
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,350
檢討咗幾多次啊？

45
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,080
呢個雙贏嘅喎。

46
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,790
佢哋嘅簡單基本待遇咧。

47
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,360
如果喺呢個時間，我哋唔做呢樣嘢，幾時做？

48
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,850
唔痛定試痛，兩年後又翻翻嚟同一個會期做同一件事。

49
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,230
循例地，我哋竟然加咗好多次，睇翻數字，次次都係根據個消費物價指數，次次都係。

50
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:24,110
機構都會話，社福機構嘅調查指啊，而家嗰個嘅半桶水嘅服務，係令到一啲嘅市民咧，去揾一啲嘅政府嘅律師嘅求助法律諮詢嘅時候係卻步。

51
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:46,610
上次我記得喺我嘅發言嘅啱啱發緊言嘅時間，我記得誒之前啊啊何君瑤議員都有提過啊，你哋啊唔可以四五次講同一條問題啊噉樣。係啊，我都同意啊，而家你嘅檢討唔應該四五次啊。

52
00:13:44,400 --> 00:14:01,060
加咗去算，我唔係要你加去好多錢。上次都有剪熟到，上次就係話，如果佢而家一日啊，一日平時一個嘅自己做律師啊，個收入已經係天價啦。佢自己形容，但係我哋嘅當值服務咧，畀多幾錢佢咧，頂多幾千蚊。

53
00:14:49,020 --> 00:15:06,060
幾次啦？四五次都係做一個根據消費物價指數嘅檢討。點解唔可以一次過咧？一次過真係尊重翻，真係為呢個嘅保障，無論係窮人定富人喺法律面前捍衞緊個班律師。

54
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:27,000
幫緊人，咁點解你唔可以喺一個制度上邊幫下手，而唔係淨係哦？我我哋有檢討㗎，會兩年一次檢討，會兩年喎，淨係加個三項收費喎。而家我哋翻翻嚟個重點就係，我如果喺今日唔能夠用一個最大嘅壓力畀政府當局。

55
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:17,810
係咪真係可以救到及時嘅災難咧？即係佢遇到問題啦，然後我哋係咪要令到佢遇到官非？我哋聽過唔少睇新聞，遇到官非，誒唔知點算，唔知點處理，又未必識揾議員，又唔識揾一啲嘅法律諮詢服務，結果係自己可能係用好多唔同嘅方法輕生啊，點樣都～

56
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:37,820
都好逃避呢件事啊！呢啲唔係我哋樂見㗎，所以我要針對嘅問題，我針對嘅情況就係點解？點解一九九二年落嘅決定到今日，只不過係會兩年一次檢討？點解淨係會兩年一次檢討？根據消費物價指數交行貨加咗佢個價錢又算數。我相信在座。

57
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:57,830
唔係淨係我哋啊！我相信在座甚至有唔少建制嘅建制派嘅議員同事都會覺得係都要做嘅，都要諗下點樣去改善、去改革而家嘅情況。起碼出庭前噉樣見一嘅見個律師都唔係一個太妥當嘅情況。我相信係因為而家我哋形容呢個半桶水啊，半桶水嘅法律諮詢，因為好多人。

58
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:17,840
都形容咧有一啲部分嘅義務嘅律師，有啲部分嘅當事律師咧，去投入程度係不足嘅。投入程度不足，即係有啲有有個俗語叫誒刁民啊嘛，即係刁民乜意思咧？就就係話佢啊duty嘅duty lawyer嘅噉佢嘅嘅服佢個服務咧就係比較半桶水㗎啦。噉樣係咪咧？我？

59
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:45,540
香港長期超過三分之一嘅民事訴訟人，當佢係冇呢個律師嘅代表㗎，呢個水平係經常被批評成不合理。控辯雙方亦都要就住當事人詳細解釋審判過程同埋個判案原則，呢個唔單止虛耗法庭嘅寶貴時間，同埋大大延誤咗審訊嘅程序，司法資源縱費。

60
00:11:48,580 --> 00:12:08,590
既然係噉，點解我哋唔能夠喺最初嘅時間做好啲？最簡單，而家加你嘅費用，加費用嘅時間，可唔可以同時問一問業界嘅情況啊？點樣能夠業界嘅同事係能夠做得更加投入？起碼佢真係會覺得哦，我做當事律師，我幫人。我事實上我見過唔少，佢真係覺得係我幫緊人嘅，我幫。

61
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:52,140
呢個落劍咩？電視機旁邊嘅小市民落劍啊！我哋唔想惹到官非，但係而家嘅情況係不得不令到我哋去擔心，因為香港嘅司法制度係需要我哋捍衞。如果呢個司法嘅制度需要捍衞，唔係淨係講一啲大嘅事情，小嘅事情，小嘅事情，民生係無。

62
00:12:52,140 --> 00:13:12,150
小事㗎。如果呢一次我哋嘅調整上係能夠有利於前線一啲嘅當事律師，係能夠直接令到普羅嘅市民受惠，所以我實在真係諗唔明，即係點解要令到我哋即係咁勞氣咧？你睇翻其實各方面都嘅意見都係啊，社福機。

63
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,980
論點。

64
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,700
誒唔好意思，無議員等一等。

65
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,780
民政事務局局長，你是否想發言？

66
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,270
資歷較深嘅同業根本係唔係好想做？

67
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:46,570
發現最初一九九二年十月當其時立法會財務委員會嗰個嘅議決係咪已經不合時宜啊？係咪可以與時並進啦？點解我哋係要容讓呢種嘅？

68
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:21,900
唔應該再因為資源不足，你窮，你工長，但係你草根出身，所以你冇錢請律師，你法律面前你又只能夠只係含冤受屈。我哋要唔見冤獄，就要做一個真正嘅檢討。主席幫人僅此陳詞。

69
00:18:44,280 --> 00:19:02,430
冗敍繁厭地重提本身或者其他議員嘅論點，若我認為議員違反有關嘅規定，我會嚴格執行議事規則，停止有關議員嘅發言。噉我請議員留意，毛孟靜議員。

70
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:44,400
呢個係咪即係呢個係咪一個非常之大嘅諷刺咧？當我哋係標榜我哋喺法律面前人人平等，我哋嘅窮人富人都好，你唔係因為窮，然後你就會誒得唔到一個應得嘅法律嘅支援嘅時間，我哋喺度就話不如純粹按物價指數。

71
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:21,350
佢真係有啲人話豬頭瓜牙而氣嚟係啊，咁但個問題咪喺度咯？點解唔能夠喺個收費上邊起碼畀翻一個同市場貼近少少、貼近少少嘅一個安排？起碼資源上，我哋唔應該再係噉樣，我哋唔應該再係淨係畀即係。

72
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:31,370
事實上，我哋睇翻立法會之前通過大律師刑事法嚟援助嘅時間，當其時呢個嘅律師會呢個嘅會長，佢都曾經講過。當其時呢個嘅當其時，佢哋都會話，如果而家呢個資源之下咧，係好難吸引年資五年以上嘅大律師同埋律師參與。

73
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:54,710
係㗎，所以我好感激頭先我分享嘅經歷。我遇到一個勁嘅律師啊，佢同我講話，佢我我記得佢嗰句就話：何俊人都係學生嚟㗎。噉我唔知係咪教咩啦，係我唔記得佢教乜嘢啦。我後屘問家人哥咧，人哥就話：我可能大學教過我啦。我係好彩有運氣地遇到一個好嘅律師，佢又唔會話即係恰我年紀細，跟住又。

74
00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:14,720
我隔離嗰個嗰個街坊真係好認真幫佢打，亦都真係幫佢誒叫做減輕個刑罰，就咁簡單啫。所以主席今日呢一個當呢一刻，我要提出呢個終止代續嘅時間，其實我只係希望能夠值多一個機會喺呢一個議事廳多一句説話。

75
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:34,730
多一段嘅討論，起碼我哋要畀更加大、更加大嘅壓力畀政府知道，其實政府真係做得唔夠㗎，各位真係做得唔夠。我哋係咪要繼續睇住個當值律師嘅服務就係咁㗎啦？你嚟到就係hea做㗎啦，唔係㗎嘛？裏邊都有好多有心嘅律師㗎嘛。既然係噉，制度上可唔可以做好啲啊？我哋可唔可以睇睇我嘅？

76
00:16:46,850 --> 00:17:06,860
默做嘅檢討，hea做嘅檢討，政府可以糊混過關，加完嗰少少嗰幾個percent就算數，然後兩年後再翻嚟。我哋唔係噉樣嘅，我哋係時候都要諗一諗點樣能夠真真正正保障香港每一位市民。呢個係回應緊頭先我所講嘅基本法，香港居民喺法律面前係人人平等。

77
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,690
即係就誒。

78
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,650
matter.

79
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,000
毛邦正議員。

80
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,080
thoughts in this.

81
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,120
佢唔喺喺度，佢唔喺度。

82
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,620
我 colleague Roy Kwong。

83
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:11,760
個嘅建議咧，亦都係徵求過兩個律師會，佢哋都希望咧能夠盡快能夠通過呢個嘅建議嘅，噉啊希望都能夠盡快做到呢個呢件事啊！

84
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:52,800
那我的query number one is why this really huge gap between criminal and civil

85
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:21,670
calculations on the part of the government, of course, of course, you can't just say oh it's a very minor, straightforward issue. Either you agree or disagree.

86
00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:07,970
court proceedings when it comes to legal aid, would it actually involve some devoid of intelligence, or is it a matter of

87
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:55,450
And you were saying that this is a very simple issue, so let's not spend too much time. You didn't quite say waste too much time on it. Now it's a matter of simplicity versus complexity.

88
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:43,100
現在嘅待議議題係現即將辯論終止待續。剛剛我容許動議人鄺俊宇議員咧係以十五分鐘陳述佢提出終止嘅理由，包括係不滿現在每兩年按消。

89
00:17:43,100 --> 00:18:03,110
費物價指數檢討發還制度嘅付費，第二係包括要求民政事務總署檢討現行嘅律師當值制度，包括係啊要求檢討現在嘅法律費用同市場收費差距大等等嘅。

90
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:24,270
由於我剛剛已經指出，誒議員提出呢一行終止待續議案咧，議題其實係好窄嘅，應該集中討論是否支持將疑議決議案嘅辯論終止待續，不應該利用呢一行辯論咧係再次係討論咧疑議決議。

91
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:44,280
案嘅具體內容，或者咧係剛剛其他議員已經詳細展述嘅內容。議事規則第四十一括弧一條，議員不得提出與議題無關嘅事宜；第四十五括弧一條，亦都定明議員不得不斷提出無關嘅事宜，或者用。

92
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:41,110
成我都聽到主席亦都有講咧，就誒呢個議題咧都講咗成差唔多八個鐘頭。誒我自己嚟呢度咧都第三個禮拜，噉啊，事實上咧就嗰個百分之四咧係誒嗰個嘅幅度咧係誒希望係好窄一個嘅討論。至於

93
00:19:41,110 --> 00:20:01,120
其他嗰啲嘅建議咧，就係一一啲嘅其他嘅檢討，未必喺呢個範疇之內。咁所以我都想，即係議員咧，係咪都可以盡早通過呢個嘅建議？咁好讓咧，我哋誒嘅律師誒嘅收費咧，係儘快咧係能夠提高嘅，同埋呢一個。

94
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:34,970
我希望官員唔好唔耐，因為我們係度做緊辛苦嘅工作，邊個會介意辛苦嘅工作？我係度支持議案草案，由我們嘅榮譽。

95
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,980
doing justice for the society.

96
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,220
公共 money 作為 legal aid。

97
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,530
Neither am I rambling off. I am making a point here.

98
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:27,630
我不同意與你的不同意，與我們。

99
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:09,780
now of course we have very passionate lawyers who are all keen about

100
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:51,860
for those who are being either sued by the government or who would want to actively sue the government.

101
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:39,500
Between the two types of court proceedings, the court cases, when it comes to using

102
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:22,860
And this whole business about four percent raise, it's not just mean. It's almost like there's something spiteful there, spiteful.

103
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:54,670
I think Hong Kong people have waited for long enough for many issues for the government to consider. Now, I'm not rambling on.

104
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:25,010
你 can never be equal with your mother. Why? Well, there's not much why because that's your mother. Full stop, and that's it. But everything up to a point.

105
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:29,880
this affair as proposed by the government, they couldn't, they just couldn't explain why was there this huge margin.

106
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:42,990
我的第二個query，和我會強烈勸請政府，不是那名官員，他已經走了，不是那名官員，他被假裝負責這個。

107
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:17,250
Proceed with my two strong arguments. What I consider strong arguments. The whole thing it's rather curious, very unpleasant if not actually dreadful.

108
00:22:43,360 --> 00:23:02,530
因為他係管內政，for God's sake，我意思係，他唔會知多關於司法或法律事務。但係政府作為一體，應該考慮獨立法律援助部門。請允許我有時間去。

109
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:44,670
你唔可以just let things go the way they are。哦，嗱，that's how we do things。that's the convention。that's the tradition。so bear with it。and you want us to consider something else？it's going to take time。bear with us again。no。

110
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:16,120
You may think it's all very simple. It's all about some consumer price index C connection, and we think the raise of payment by you know meagre four per cent. It's just too paltry. It's just.

111
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:36,130
almost irrelevant, and if you don't like it, just vote against it. No, it's not that simple. We have to look at the issue that's associated. You may disagree, but we have every right to voice our.

112
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:12,890
在生活，我們 often tend to talk about equality，但，nothing， nobody are absolutely equal， not even twins， right？ We talk about fairness。 Please， fairness is even more important than equality。 I always tell my university students that.

113
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,410
how is it going to work?

114
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,850
In in my criminal case, right?

115
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,510
of our lawyers， especially the young ones。

116
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,380
And people would say，oh，if you pay peanuts，you get monkeys。

117
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:55,140
It's a matter of appreciation, some basic fairness in the mechanism, in the system, don't you think?

118
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:23,150
因為，The payment simply doesn't cover what I need to spend on it. Maybe parking charges alone.

119
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:00,020
And as a defendant in a criminal case, as Roy was pointing out just now, I surely

120
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:48,670
with some you know really seriously noble unselfish kind of devotion to the profession.

121
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:56,430
無議員呢一點咧，頭先抗議員都有提述，我都提醒議員咧，誒法律費用同市場差距大咧，已經清楚。

122
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:27,880
但 if my lawyer's not feeling that appreciated, well, nothing, that's my fault. But the whole system is so off-putting.

123
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:46,380
And to many lawyers, well there are exceptions of course, but to many lawyers, the legal profession it's not just a job, it's a calling, a devotion.

124
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:12,600
would hop would need would want some expertly surface rendered to me, if I were a beneficiary of some legal aid.

125
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:38,770
are expensive, are more than what I'm getting paid for that legal aid, that sort of thing. Okay, it's insulting to people in the legal profession, especially those.

126
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:47,340
this is this doesn't apply here, I should think. Most lawyers couldn't care less if it's four percent or fourteen percent or for that matter even forty for zero percent hike in the payment. Most of them, I should think. But, but

127
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:15,570
What's the meaning of this? He gets paid a hundred bucks because he's doing some civil case, and I'm doing not just pro bono. I need to pay extra for my own costs in order to help out this defendant under this legal aid department.

128
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:16,720
表述啦，包括你亦都表述啦，而且你係再集中討論你是否支持跨議院提議嘅終止待續議案。你繼續。Yes, I'm not rambling off.嘅宗旨待續議案。Okay. I never呃got sidetracked. I am呃on track all this time. I'm urging the government not to dampen the zest.

129
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,690
It's a.

130
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,640
政府部門。

131
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,180
And so, if

132
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,830
The horse of Troy，then。

133
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,700
Who actually need some income, please, to help with society?

134
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,550
on this legal aid department status, to make it please more independent.

135
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:03,180
所以那係我嘅點，again，我需要政府properly reconsider，to have a proper rethink。

136
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:07,320
The connecting lengths, the horse of Troy, you know what I'm talking about. Do you know much about Greek mythology?

137
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:53,950
到Chief Executive，and as a result，on and off，on and off，there are accusations all the time that the ICAC may not be 100% independent.

138
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:58,800
是 simply not fair, and I was talking about fairness. That's it. The gap. Remember the first thing I mentioned just now when I first stood up to speak. The gap between the two types of.

139
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:15,130
judicial cases, lawsuits, right? So I am done with my point one. I am now proceeding to my point two, and that is the independence of the legal aid department.

140
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:24,310
We're just not sure what's behind this. As I was saying, it's either devoid of intelligence or is saturated with calculations. Because the government thinks most major judicial review cases.

141
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:43,500
And what we're having here is actually quite an unjustifiable pronouncement on the alleged inferiority of criminal proceedings when it comes to legal aid, of course, and.

142
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:41,890
一組人工作在法律，屬於政府的一部分。如何能説它絕對獨立？看ICAC，説它是獨立的，但它是不可質疑的。

143
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,530
呃。

144
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,830
毛孟靜議員。

145
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,770
郭家麒議員要求點算法定人數？

146
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,360
或the other way round，I don't know，so。

147
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,700
議員請返回座位，保持肅靜。

148
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,960
誒等一等，無議員啊，國家琪議員，你係提出虧錢問題，會議室未夠發明。

149
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:19,300
The complete, almost complete disregard for the feelings of the legal profession.

150
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,510
raised by members of the public against the government or civil, so we need to take much more.

151
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:41,970
of the civil side of things is that the government's thinking.

152
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,680
We just don't know what the calculations are behind this kind of government thinking.

153
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:11,290
phenomenon as presented to us, right in front of us, right under our nose.

154
00:32:47,460 --> 00:33:00,320
There's another thing I would like the government to seriously think about, and that is not to unnecessarily provoke our legal profession.

155
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:26,840
Well，and，my，points，are，just，valid.，Last，time，I，was，comparing，the，legal，A，department，to，RTHK，and，I，clearly，remembered，you，were，frowning，at，the，mention，of，RTHK，but，they，are，comparable.

156
00:31:45,640 --> 00:32:02,060
What I'm saying is, what's inside that horse? If you know what I mean. Ah, I shouldn't say horse of Troy. Maybe I should just say Trojan horse. Then you would know what I'm talking about.

157
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:33,350
just let it out of the government mechanism。我必須提醒你，呢個二議決議案嘅內容咧，係按住消費物價指數調高幾項費用四個百分比。你剛剛提述嘅反對或者支持終止理由係指法援處咧不夠獨立咧，誒不是呢一個。

158
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:53,360
議決議案嘅內容，但係我都容容許你講。I know，希望你唔好再誒詳細展述呢個論點啦。啊，如果冇其他新嘅論點，你亦都清楚表達咗你嘅立場啦。你有冇新嘅論點？如果唔係，我就停止你發言。Well, I'd like to discuss with you in that case the association of

159
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:47,460
and today I was just now talking about the I C A C。 It's the same thing perception。冇依個，我再次提醒你呢一點咧。我認為係與呢一個宗旨項目無關嘅。你我剛剛亦都用佢例子出啦。噉我諗你清楚已經講咗你嘅立場。OK。

160
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,730
淘緊新議員。

161
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,290
咁誒？

162
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,550
就誒，我只係香港職業律師啫嚇。

163
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,470
誒嗰個誒表列嘅一啲嘅誒誒服務。

164
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:28,020
主席就誒，而家咧抗議員咧提出呢個咧就係誒終止。

165
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,690
雖然咧比較做得少嘅嚇，盈時確實OK，咁但係都係穩陣啲嚇，宣佈咗利益嚇。

166
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:45,640
accusation. This is just not very fair, and I thank you for the time.

167
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:09,690
噉就誒，而因為呢個身份咧，亦都有誒誒參與咧，係法律援助。

168
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:59,310
誒主席，就誒我先或者就就算呢個中止嘅議案咧，我覺得都誒穩陣啲啊，宣佈一次利益啦嚇。噉就因為我係一位誒執業律師啦。

169
00:46:41,860 --> 00:47:01,870
I know you're trying very hard to cut me short, but I hope you're not a difficult person to explain things to. Seriously, the official thoughtlessness as displayed in this matter is unthinkable, and it always puzzles me as to why there's such a

170
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:39,590
It's rampant. It's so blatant, so clear. And then the public perception of what the government or how the government rather is treating two separate and different court proceedings, they just couldn't care less. So

171
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:59,600
That's one thing I thought you should allow this council to try to make sure that the government got the message that this demand, this urge, will get etched in the heads, in the minds of government officials.

172
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:19,610
And not to just let this pass lightly, casually, as though it's just one of the millions of tiny things we deal with in the council, and we don't need to pay too much attention to what some of the people have to say or think. And another thing.

173
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:39,620
Before I sit down, I do object to the repeated suggestion that we should not—we're not allowed to repeat what others have had to say. Now, first of all, you have to allow the fact that great minds think alike. I echo so and.

174
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:59,630
So opinion, I don't see what's wrong with that. And the second thing is, very often I agree or somebody would agree with somebody's comments, except not wholly, only partly. And there's a debating point there. That's obvious, right? And so you have to allow people.

175
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,800
噉。

176
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,430
噉嘅地方。

177
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,870
改革啊！

178
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,560
咁誒。

179
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,190
但係個問題咧，就係。

180
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,240
畀到咩嘅誒？

181
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,320
所以我嗰啲我唔會重複講嗰啲。

182
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,390
信息畀政府或者個社會咧？

183
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,380
咁亦都有咧，誒好多地方都需要檢討啊，需要。

184
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,610
我哋係繼續辯論誒呢一個議案。

185
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,600
同埋咧係誒個制度啊，個基礎咧係誒幾不滿嘅。

186
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:47,820
誒，今次嗰個誒計算嗰個誒方程式。

187
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,520
當我哋要考慮係咪支持一個終止代續啊，終止啦嚇。OK。

188
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:27,220
而最後咧，就誒當然係要獲得多數同事支持啦嚇，先至可以終止啦。

189
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:20,300
咁即係嗰嗰個含義係乜嘢咧？嗱，當然，如果佢係中止咗。

190
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:41,680
咁誒，其實較早前咧，我喺嗰個主題嗰個發言裏邊咧，即係我係確實係流露出咧，係對。

191
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:19,640
Time to elaborate on what they really think of the issue at hand. Why they perfectly agree with somebody or some specific comment, but then in part others would say, but there's a great but, a but with a.

192
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:39,650
Capital B, that we need to completely argue thoroughly, completely and so on and so forth. So you can't just say, oh, you're repeating. If you're repeating yourself, then that's not desirable. That's for sure. But repeating others, what?

193
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,610
OK。

194
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:33,660
好啦。

195
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,260
啊。

196
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,090
而呢啲信息。

197
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,480
佢會唔會咁做咧？

198
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,040
啊！有幾大嘅？

199
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,320
噉係唔係可以根據現時常規？

200
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,560
能夠化成乜嘢嘅力量？

201
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,370
四個percent啦嚇，呢個叫OK，即係嘅加幅。

202
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,870
能夠令到政府。

203
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,300
令到，如果佢係統一嘅嚇，即係嗰個比較集中嘅。

204
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:29,440
嚟又再畀通夠足夠通局，然後就再嚟過。

205
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,890
如果我哋有足夠嘅議員係通過呢個終止嘅動議。

206
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,470
當然，如果一個好好好惡劣咁講啦嚇，即係如果政府話你中止咗啫噉。

207
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:20,640
政府又可以話：，誒，我畀夠日數，誒，將成個。

208
00:51:53,320 --> 00:52:03,870
誒推動力，或者説服力，或者決心，能夠去向住我哋呢啲嘅信息所推動嘅目標同方向嚟到邁進咧。

209
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,990
不滿。

210
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,640
啊。

211
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,870
噉。

212
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,140
咁呢個？

213
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,470
主席先講嗰個。

214
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,800
咁誒？

215
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,470
四個percent咧係好少嘅。

216
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,510
我哋今次中止咗呢個所謂四個percent。

217
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,750
跟住落嚟，我哋要討論嘅範圍嚟嘅。

218
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,990
啊！影響先啦，啊！呢個反而相對咧係誒。

219
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:50,260
當當呢個啱先啦，噉啊起碼都有得加係嘛，即係好好過唔加噉。

220
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:29,770
我可以話微不足道嘅嚇，因為而家咧，嗱，根據物價指數咧，原本係加四個percent。

221
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:57,360
我哋嘅為嘅目的就係所謂改革，一個啊徹底嘅改革。

222
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:45,910
而個信息係清楚嘅，尤其是係為咗對嗰個基本嘅方程式。

223
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:13,020
咁究竟啊，會有幾多人受影響？誒，好同埋壞呢啲嘅估計咧，就係我哋今次。

224
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:45,790
原本點解加四個percent咧？就因為話跟翻嗰個方程式個通脹噉。咁當然我先唔好講話嗰個formula，即係咩物價指數C嗰啲餅類嗰啲啦。

225
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,500
啊！

226
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,150
就。

227
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,610
誒個信息。

228
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,840
行家即係律師。

229
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,680
但係，我可以話畀主席聽咧。

230
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,050
噉我諗最重要咧，就係反而咧，就係。

231
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,830
反而最重要咧，就係個信息係乜嘢？

232
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,010
佢發覺原來立法會。

233
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,370
如果你話今次四個percent咧，對？

234
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,770
即係如果我哋嗰啲法援嘅。

235
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:59,350
誒，如果你話有一啲有冇啲律師佢誒話？

236
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:22,930
造成更加壞嘅後果，即係更加律師係少嘅律師係會願意參與，OK？我覺得呢個咧係唔成立嘅。

237
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:13,160
你加個四個percent，噉我做啦，即係我我我會參與呢個法援嘅誒工作。如果你唔加咧，就會有誒一個percent、兩個percent或者幾多percent嘅律師咧，就因為你唔呢個加幅咧，噉啊就。

238
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:23,270
因為點解咧？即係原本唔做法援嗰啲咧都唔做㗎啦，唔會因為四個percent，亦都唔會因為你四個percent咧而佢啊原本唔做而家又做，唔會啊更當然更加唔會邏輯上更加荒謬嘅就係話啊你你加咗我就唔做啦，唔加我就做啦，噉啊呢個更加荒謬啦，唔使講。

239
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:40,000
啊？點解咧？因為即係好坦白講，誒參與得發換，尤其是誒喺而家噉嘅制度之下，嗰個誒同主席話齋啦，即係嗰個相距咁遠，嗰個誒同出邊嘅私人嘅市場咧。

240
00:54:44,780 --> 00:55:03,580
我我甚至可以夠膽講啦嚇，即係我我認識嘅，誒參與發言嘅，我啲同學啊、啲師弟先師妹啊噉樣咧，就我相信對佢哋嚟講咧，呢個絕對咧係唔係一個因素嚟嘅。即係換句話講咧，即係唔會話我哋唔通過中四個percent噉，可能仲要等好耐。咁有啲人咧就話，因此我唔參與啦噉。

241
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,860
一個。

242
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,650
或者知心嘅程度。

243
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,010
憲制上嘅公平。

244
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,110
就覺得為咗。

245
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,080
公道嘅一個發還制度。

246
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,990
喺立法會喺呢個會會議裏邊。

247
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,270
啊！法律嘅公義。

248
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,760
比較係合符。

249
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,590
明明就係按個通脹嚟加四個percent。

250
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:48,050
市民代表，市民好唔滿意而家嘅方程式。

251
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,950
而去令到政府係有一個挫折。

252
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:44,470
噉啊！今次突然間咧，就有一啲誒突變啦嚇，你可以話就係。

253
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:53,800
啊！原來咧，我哋嘅議員代表我哋嘅社會嘅市民，唔係代表律師啊！嚇，OK。

254
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:16,540
能夠請到一個合乎資更加合乎資格嘅律師嚟到幫佢哋手。

255
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:43,060
咁如果我哋本會係畀多個信息，就係話：，咦，我哋本會嘅議員。

256
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:35,880
嗱呢個呢個呢個你唔可以話唔係一個錯字，因為政府係施政啊嘛。政府話我根據我嘅政策咧，我就應該加加加嘅噉。噉我檢討過，我就加啦。

257
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,260
另外一點。

258
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,190
我哋。

259
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:01,190
我覺得咧，我哋嘅。

260
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,180
如果我哋而家嗰個，

261
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,510
如果我哋畀到呢個信息嘅話咧，

262
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,290
好多嘅誒市民係會受鼓舞。

263
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,300
但係佢知道咧，原來咧個立法會代表咁多市民。

264
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,480
咁多同事，如果能夠通過咗呢個終止嘅議案。

265
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,830
嚟到去係一個共同嘅信息，係迫使政府做出改革，做出個徹底嘅改革。

266
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:30,230
我覺得呢個咧係對佢哋繼續去服務發援、服務社會係一個強心針嚟。

267
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:46,890
能唔能夠構成一個重大嘅壓力或者説服力，令到政府會改變呢？咁？

268
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:13,450
我哋好多嘅同行，即係法律嘅同行咧，佢會係知道，就算我冇咗呢四個percent，佢繼續做。

269
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:39,860
誒所謂叫做經過咗成廿年啦嚇，九二年到到一六年十幾廿年，先至做一個改誒設檢討。如果檢討完咧，最後咧，其實係同個私人市場真係差好遠嘅。

270
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:23,230
因為我覺得呢個唔係淨係我哋民主派議員嘅專利，因為佢裏邊都譬如有啲同事以前係律師會長，有好多同事咧根本有誒係喺律師嗰行咧好耐嘅，佢唔會冇意見，佢唔會冇個感受。

271
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:55,180
而咩項目係包，咩項目係唔包？誒，同嗰個所謂收入、同嗰個支出，即係譬如律師行嘅誒誒誒誒cost啊嗰啲成本啊等，係根本咧係唔唔係一個合理嘅掛鈎嘅？

272
00:56:48,770 --> 00:57:08,780
要作出一個徹底嘅改變嘅改革。嗱，記住我呢個徹底嘅改變嘅改革咧，當然我哋就誒誒，過往咧係唔同嘅議員咧，佢未必完全一樣嘅嗱。當然建制派同事咧比較少講呢個呢個題目，但係我都希望佢哋咧都啊啊，即係可以表達一下。咁點解？

273
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,910
嗱，我覺得咧。

274
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,840
呢個係絕對有嘅。

275
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,530
根據法例裏邊。

276
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,440
呢個一定係一個好重嘅壓力。

277
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,150
因為如果今個終止嘅議案，

278
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:20,070
佢做出嘅一個正式嘅議案嘅修訂。

279
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:31,320
而政府遭到一個重大嘅挫敗。

280
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,000
而本身係因為好多同事。

281
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,710
當然，你話我哋有冇以往見過一啲嘅所謂政策？

282
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:12,280
而呢樣嘢本身咧，如果通過得到，即係好多同事都支持。

283
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:28,310
即係垃圾管理唔係一定係主體條例嘅，可能係一個動議，但係佢都係一個有立法效力。嗱，記住呢個係有立法效力個part嚟嘅。

284
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:28,320
就算本會通過一啲咩叫無約束力動議係嘛，主席啊，即係我哋嗰啲誒motion debate啦，嗰啲辯論。

285
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:07,030
係都都幾政治性嘅，政治性係咩咧？就係因為你係令到政府某一樣嘢咧，係佢認為原本啱㗎啦，唔需要改㗎啦，唔需要檢討嘅嘢，係有一個挫敗。

286
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:41,250
噉啊！政府咧都話好多都唔做嘅喎，甚至咧佢之後咧誒誒話會一段時間半年咧就話同你交代翻啊！我啊誒按住你嘅動議咧就有啲咩嘅誒做咗啦噉樣。其實好多咧嗰啲咧，真係老實講咧。

287
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:57,050
對對唔住，我真係講坦白，好多係廢話嚟，甚至嗰個提出嗰個咧就頂住道氣添。如果睇你，即係當然有好多人唔睇，我知道啊。但係如果譬如有啲動議係我都相關，我一定睇。如果我係嗰個動議人啊，揾我想修訂通過或者唔通過都，我睇完咧我眼火爆。

288
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:14,010
乜？個你記住，今個咧係一個，無論你點樣講都好，呢個係按個法律，即係個structural mechanism。記住啊，雖然你可以話噉，你咪唔加咯，唔加咗咪由佢噉樣，我咪擺喺度咯噉。但係如果政府係一個，

289
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,280
主席。

290
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,400
其實要嘅。

291
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,620
最後。

292
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,420
咁會唔會？

293
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,390
政府會覺得係。

294
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,110
有嘢要再做翻嘅咧，噉。

295
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,570
如果佢再唔翻嚟，

296
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,440
係要去到一個程度，包括建制派嘅同事。

297
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,370
如果佢係今次有挫敗。

298
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,570
噉你話，如果佢真係唔翻嚟？

299
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,550
點解咧？因為如果佢原本嘅政策，

300
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:42,970
但係一段時間，甚至嗰個咧，佢唔可以話再再隔兩年喎。

301
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:13,140
噉我咪算啦！你話你話加四percent，我唔加。噉我唔翻，我係唔改革，係唔檢討㗎啦噉。

302
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:45,530
都係不同意政府呢個而家嘅政策，而家嘅立論。嗱，當然我冇期望誒咩。

303
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:33,810
係根據一個誒法律嘅基礎同埋定咗嘅formula嚟到要檢討。

304
01:00:45,920 --> 01:01:01,300
行政會議員啊嚟到贊成啦，因為佢哋可能有佢嘅政治嘅約束。但係如果其他好多有嘅事，如果比較多嘅啊唔係法律界議員啦嚇，OK，咁呢個咧都係一個好重要嘅象徵嘅意義。

305
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,350
主席。

306
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,220
檢討。

307
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,380
我相信啊！

308
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,920
遇到挫敗。

309
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,410
唔會放過政府。

310
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,990
或者再唔有一個。

311
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:16,170
啊！主席咁咯，我我翻嚟啊，我翻嚟啊，啊！不如我三三個又翻嚟。

312
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:16,630
我好有信心，本會嘅議員今次支持終止嘅。

313
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,870
按住佢應該要施政嘅嘢，遇到挫敗，然後佢就話：係你立法會唔通過啫嘛，唔關我事。

314
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:43,790
過唔過到關咧？咁嗱，主席，政府亦都要膽薄膽，因為你諗下，如果我哋通過咗今次嘅政終止動議。

315
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:34,880
主席，呢個唔係淨係講個錢嘅問題，而一個政府，如果佢經常喺立法會，

316
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,940
一定會繼續反對。噉你話我噉，你咪反對咯？我四點五又唔過啊！咁咁咪等你嗰啲誒，仲個嗰個gap更加遠咯噉。

317
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:11,850
唔得嘅，你可以想象咧。如果我哋今次能夠通過到呢個終止動議，四個percent我打回頭，係要佢作為一個徹徹底檢討。而政府話我係唔檢討啦，到時三個月後四點percent嚟。

318
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:58,260
而政府真係用我就先噉樣嘅所謂軟皮，即係我我視為軟皮蛇策略，我係爛仔㗎啦，我係唔唔檢討㗎啦，啊，你唔中意就算，你夠膽咪再煲單我，啊，我四點五percent嘅啫，三個月翻嚟，我跟翻嗰個最新物價指數。

319
01:01:51,890 --> 01:02:11,900
有人可能會咧係按而家嘅政府嘅政策、誒誒誒formula等等，然後咧甚至提出司法複核，而到時政府要答辯嘅時候咧係困難好多嘅。當然我唔敢話嗰個司法複核一定贏梗，但係咧因為佢係一個法律嘅基礎有有方程式，咁當然你可以話。

320
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:36,460
我咪再睇睇嗰陣時嘅物價指數啊，可能嗰陣時再對一對就係兩年零啊啊啊啊三個月啦噉，咁咧就係誒誒加多，譬如誒零點五percent噉，噉我到時我咪軟皮蛇，我計整個四點五個percent上嚟，OK，即係為咗你輸入複合啊，OK，政府輸，咁得。

321
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,240
我我 want to very.

322
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,390
poignantly, set out three.

323
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:10,010
我唔係 going to repeat my speech.

324
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,230
所以呢個係最好嘅場合去做呢樣嘢。你嘅時間到啦，梁繼昌議員。

325
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:15,100
You know, I made last week when the resolution was being discussed.

326
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,770
因為咧，你唔係咁容易有一個場合嗱，呢個場合咧係被逼大家要坐喺度，大家被逼要表態。

327
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:52,620
The speech, I will be very focused, as you point out, Madame President, that we need to be very focused to set out our reason.

328
01:03:54,890 --> 01:04:03,250
主席，咁另一個問題啦，有同事就可能會噉樣研究，佢話：，喂，阿土，你咪畀佢加咗先。

329
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:53,740
呢個咧，作為一個顧住面子、顧住信譽、顧住民望、顧住要交代同問責嘅政府，係過唔到骨嘅。

330
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:36,270
大家被逼咧，係要對政府嗰個合理與唔合理係要發言。當然，你你選擇唔發言冇得講啦。但係你諗下，如果我哋話畀佢加下先，然後檢討，噉啊邊度檢討咧？

331
01:05:52,900 --> 01:06:06,040
whether we are going to support this motion to adjourn this resolution or why we support it, or why we do not support it and give the reason of why we we are not supporting it.

332
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:43,810
review it， and we have to compile the rate in accordance with a basket of consumer price index， namely the category C consumer price index， which would consist of more luxurious consumer goods。

333
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:49,970
司法事務委員會，司法事務委員會係咪有一個更更加比而家好嘅場合，係可以反映我哋一個投票贊成與否，同埋好明顯令到政府挫敗嘅一個意志咧？

334
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:17,410
四個percent，你加咗先啦，袋咗落袋先，即係呢個好多時我哋講中環啊，咩咩任何嘢都係㗎啦，巴士咩咩福利係嘛？噉你咪咪收咗貨先咯，你收咗貨你都可以壓壓佢㗎嘛噉。嗱呢個唔得嘅，主席。

335
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:10,240
Thank you, Acting Madam President. And now I'm speaking on a motion moved by the Honourable Roy Kwong to adjourn the resolution we are debating under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.

336
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:30,530
Madam President, as you rightly pointed out, this resolution is simple now because what we are doing here is just to increase the rate to be paid to the duty lawyers, and this rate would be reviewed every two years. And now it comes the time that we have to.

337
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,160
你 know.

338
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,830
表決動議，將動議撤銷。

339
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,390
機械的調整，或四%。

340
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:17,730
And I could think of you know quite straightforward.

341
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:05,230
charge and who do not have and who do not have means to contest all these charges.

342
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:09,730
But actually, based on this 0.3 alone, I do not see a single you know.

343
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:12,340
Now，the third criteria would be quite easy to understand.

344
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:39,400
在legal A系統，then I would rather not touching on this very

345
01:08:55,510 --> 01:09:03,370
honour this adjustment, then I would, you know, support Mr. Kwong's motion to adjourn the resolution.

346
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:54,290
The three criterias are that number one, if the government can within six months come up with a better mechanism for the calculation of.

347
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:53,410
或會那4% increment did so much harm， whether it's a real harm or perceptual harm to the profession or people using the profession that we should not.

348
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:31,760
是那，如果政府能喺最近六個月內， come up with a more comprehensive overhaul of the current legal aid system， which I think many of our honourable friends here have already pointed out in their main speech， the gaps。

349
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:40,680
main baselines or direction, which I would, if any one not not all of them, if any one of this, you know, criteria would be satisfied, or only one of them would be satisfied, then I would be more tempted to support Mr.

350
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:14,580
The adjustment mechanism. Then I would rather leave this, you know, adjustment at the moment because too frequent adjustments would be just a disturbance to the people using the legal aid service. That's criteria one. But I would like to elaborate criteria one later. Now criteria two.

351
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:59,690
you know mean four percent increment in the duty law rate because it is also just a very piecemeal fix of a system which is very important especially for people who are under a criminal investigation or facing criminal

352
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:38,940
reason why I should not support this motion merely because if you think about choosing between no increment that is we remain the status quo we are not doing anything to the charge rate or we are going to have a just a very

353
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:36,580
嗯。

354
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:01,390
And they should be remunerated at an appropriate rate.

355
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:48,070
主席，關於內政，如果我可，我可，kindly want you to clarify this，會回應，到呢個辯論。

356
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:19,000
點？Why I should or we should should also try to convince my honourable friends not to support this motion.

357
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:24,020
Now, if the secretary for home affairs can give us a broad outline of an alternative mechanism to adjust.

358
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:59,010
如果，的 secretary for home affairs could in his speech make an undertaking to give us a better adjustment mechanism within the six months.

359
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:15,480
但至少，它係一個much better mechanism than using a composite consumer price index. In fact, many of these adjustments.

360
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:12,330
Now I'm not saying that they should be remunerated at a commercial rate, which is sometimes I do think quite high and quite unaffordable to ordinary citizens.

361
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:04,490
now this adjustment is more linked to the market, and of course I'm not suggesting we are fully reflecting the upward or downward trend because the adjustment would be too much.

362
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:36,370
the index, for example, trying to link the index with another basket of goods, which I don't think is a good idea at all, because what we need to do is to give

363
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:13,620
Then I will probably try to support Mr. Kwong's motion to adjourn this adjustment, because for the reason I've already outlined, merely having an interim adjustment is not satisfactory.

364
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:39,320
now having said so though my point number three could be quite straightforward and well satisfied but let's come back to point number one is about the kind of adjustment or the mechanism to be used by the government, madam president I do believe the secretary

365
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:56,750
a reasonable return, a remuneration, to the honourable lawyers who have, you know, some of them gave up the time, gave up their chargeable work to do the pro bono work, in order for justice to be carried out in this.

366
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:32,790
And in fact, one of the very key elements of the you know rule of law is to have you know accessibility to justice and affordable you know legal assistance. Now I'm not trying to suggest that we should link up the whole thing to the commercial rate, but rather if you you look at it in a more in.

367
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:52,800
Direct way, the adjustment. I would think. I don't know whether the home of the secretary will agree. That would would be linked up to the salary trend of the lawyers involved. No matter they are commercial lawyers or lawyers who are practising in chambers.

368
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:35,950
undertaken by the government in this subsidiary legislation are all linked to class C consumer price index. But I cannot think of a legitimate reason why the class C consumer price index has been chosen to adjust the duty lawyers, you know, upward or downward adjust.

369
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,650
那，first of all。

370
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,900
啲啊。

371
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,070
and also。

372
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:45,590
It's also used for other types of fee adjustment.

373
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:41,410
and in fact, this Class C or Category C consumer price index.

374
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:30,520
legal aid system here is full of gaps.

375
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:08,020
for the government to tell me that oh yeah they are going to do it and if they are going to do it.

376
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:45,480
pitfalls, imperfect and all that. Well, it sounds so, but I think at least we do have some form of legal aid to provide to our, you know.

377
01:13:45,810 --> 01:14:00,610
公民，和呢個法律援助，覆蓋三個方面，即係自由法律諮詢計劃（FLAS）所稱的義務律師，和緊急法律援助計劃，係呢個特別條例嘅主題。

378
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:41,090
One one very important factor which I think the the adjustment fee adjustment doesn't cover is the indemnity insurance rules. And in fact, the current indemnity insurance rule would restrict ability of in-house counsel, retired practitioners.

379
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:23,870
then I probably would say let's wait and let's drop this you know piecemeal amendment. Now one of the other big problem here we are facing about the the legal aid scheme is the regulatory issues.

380
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:43,480
improve the aid given to the citizens by covering the proceeding stage and application, especially for the legal aid, is itself a process that requires legal analysis, but is now not covered by the legal aid scheme.

381
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:23,780
啲free legal advice，given by the NGOs. But however, I do believe that I I would like the government to look into whether they can, within the next six months, come up with a supplementary scheme which can

382
01:14:44,230 --> 01:15:02,610
Another issue in this overhaul, if the government is going to undertake it, and if the government is going to undertake it, I may vote yes or no to the present German motion depending on whether there is a you know credibility.

383
01:12:45,870 --> 01:13:05,880
and up to now, up to this point, I haven't heard of any valid or detailed explanation from the government why it should be the case. What is the linkage？我提醒你，你已經進入咗呢個制度選擇丙類物價指數嘅。

384
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:25,890
Right. Okay. 嗮，請你係。Yeah, I will. I will drop this point because I'm just want. I just want the secretary for home affairs to give an undertaking. If he can do it, then we can drop this adjustment because it's simple as that. Okay. Point number one has been dealt with. Point number two. Well, some people say that is the the criminal.

385
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,730
The law society.

386
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:42,430
One other thing we are not being told is.

387
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:33,690
因為，as I have already pointed out， some of these lawyers。

388
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:55,950
has ever been audited? Has this scheme ever been audited? What kind of value?

389
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:49,530
Okay, that is the legal aid scheme. The fee has been paid out, and what is the value for money?

390
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:06,230
And if the government can give me an undertaking saying that okay, we can fix it within the six within six months.

391
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:27,580
Account the kind of extra exposure these practitioners would be facing in terms of indemnity insurance. In fact, the inherent risk has not been addressed.

392
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:44,500
我哋睇到，係要增加費，要

393
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:38,870
now now you you have to queue up properly if you are going to the magistrate court. Yes, you you you will you will get a duty lawyer to to do your job. But however,

394
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:49,000
cannot actually do this legal aid. Even you know the government is paying them because they are not qualified to take out a valid indemnity insurance.

395
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:58,750
We don't have enough pool. In fact, the pool is there, but they are not, you know, eligible to get a coverage for indemnity insurance. That is the big problem. Why this scheme is not operating as it is?

396
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:56,390
and even legal academics to do pro bono work, and they cannot be acting as you know pro bono lawyers in the magistrate court, and it doesn't seem that I mean these legal aid scheme.

397
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:25,950
Then I would say yes. Why can't we wait for a more accessible, more comprehensive legal aid scheme so that more people can benefit, and there would be more human resources to address the needs and the woes of the citizens.

398
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:16,680
has cover that kind of premium for the payment of current of indemnity insurance, which is can be quite hefty for individual practitioners. But why why why is the reason that the legal aid fee is just payable to the practitioners as a fee, but without taking into

399
01:16:50,070 --> 01:17:10,080
And also, current indemnity insurance and pension certificate rules make it impossible to NGOs. Because as you know, acting president, the Legal Aid Scheme also cover a free legal advice scheme operated by the NGO and.

400
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:32,200
梁議員，我諗唔需要詳細展述你對現在發還制度嘅意見。誒，你嘅意見咧已經清楚記錄㗎啦。呢個亦都相信你考慮是否支持終止嘅理由。Now, if if if the fee is going to be increased, I would also like to see

401
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,330
The.

402
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,330
陳志全議員。

403
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,400
Are we deriving from this scheme?

404
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:50,120
scheme，then I will probably also。

405
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,560
We are not measuring the value merely by the number of people using the scheme.

406
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:38,010
although it is a very important function, we must assess.

407
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,770
support my honourable friends' you know motion to adjourn.

408
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:09,980
所以如果你係just增加四%，does it means that the efficiency or the value for money will increase four percent?

409
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:17,200
Are there any formal survey of satisfaction conducted by the law society and the Home Affairs Department?

410
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:47,160
value for the legal service. So if they can do that, if they can come up with a very comprehensive

411
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:21,790
It actually did something to increase the rate. I don't see a reason to object to that, based on my final point. But let me see. Thank you.

412
01:19:56,050 --> 01:20:04,510
And I think I would defer to the secretary for home affairs to answer my first two questions.

413
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:13,850
Before I made up my mind to vote yes or no to this motion, as I have already mentioned, my point three, I've made it very clear. This is not a vice.

414
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:32,870
to conduct on the user of the scheme so that they are graded against satisfaction of the services they are provided with. We are not having a charity here, Madam President.

415
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:46,310
多謝代主席，亦都要多謝代主席咧，非常之細心體貼啦。將你頭先誒温馨提示擴進議員同埋所有議員嘅文字稿咧，都交到嚟我哋嘅手上。主席，我咧係第一個誒，針對呢一個二零一七年刑事。

416
01:20:46,310 --> 01:21:06,320
而案件法律援助修正規例嘅主體議案咧，係發言嘅。嗯，如果你記得咧，當其時咧，其實我都冇好清楚咁講，我係支持定係唔支持咧呢一個法案嘅通過，因為大家都知道呢樣嘢，即使建制派咧有發言議員都係覺得。

417
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,450
我相信政府咧。

418
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,240
係待住先嘅。

419
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,280
有議員會覺得啊！

420
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:54,340
都係唔會聆聽業界嘅訴求。

421
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,760
先講第一，議員係唔能夠透過修訂規例去改善現有嘅情況。

422
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:34,660
如果全部議員或者大部分議員都覺得呢個水平係唔啱嘅話，通過修正案啊！

423
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:07,360
叫做畀政府最大、更大或者最大嘅壓力。第四係中止代續嘅話。

424
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:30,520
多謝康俊宇議員咧，係提出呢一個終止代續嘅議案。我咧有機會咧係可以。

425
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:39,570
去支持，我係有八個理由咧，係支持呢一個議案嘅。咁所以我每個理由唔會講好長嘅時間。

426
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:38,560
第七，政府過去多年亦都冇聽過民間律師同埋議員嘅訴求。第八咧，我最後有時間先至講畀大家知。

427
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:21,190
呢四個percent真係做鹽唔鹹，做醋唔酸。不過你唔要又唔係，否決佢又唔係。咁可能投票嘅時候咧，有人會選擇棄權。

428
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:49,490
都未必過唔到嘅嚇，而家我哋連小組又冇人舉手成立，又冇修正案。不過我喺度想指出，係同埋向公眾提出，即使我哋係成立小組委員會，喺會中不斷去促請政府去提升收費。

429
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:26,940
不過叫拉唔拉布嘅辯論啦，誒，可能你會覺得如果你唔滿意而家嘅情況，點解當初唔成立小組委員會去探討咧？點解唔入一啲修正案去修正而家呢一條誒法律援助嘅規例咧？啊！

430
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:59,860
第一咧就係議員唔能夠透過修訂規例規則去改善現有嘅制度。第二係調整機制咧，只係能夠由政府佢自己去改變。第三係終止代續，可以加強政府改善收費機制嘅決心，或者。

431
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:27,650
如果唔提中止待續嘅話，係有機會改善無期。第五，現時政府最有現時係政府最有條件上調收費水平嘅時機。第六，現時終止嘅話，政府尚有時間再提交相關嘅附屬法例。

432
01:22:48,560 --> 01:23:08,570
呢個就住二零一七年刑事案件法律法律援助修訂規例提出終止代續建制派一定咧係會唔耐煩或者表達一啲不滿，我都希望你哋可以發言㗎嚇。如果係想表達不滿，因為認為呢個係一個拉布嘅手段。不過我唔希望即係呢個議題有會跌入。

433
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,410
主題發言嘅時候講過嘅嘢。

434
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:25,290
我哋嘅收費，法援律師嘅收費仍然係低於市價。

435
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:12,340
因此，按照呢個而家嘅調整機制嘅決定。

436
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:18,960
我講過係根據財委會通過嘅文件，佢並冇列入法例，因此我哋點樣去修訂？

437
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:54,750
嗰個調整都有有問題啦，我唔喺呢度去詳細去重複，我喺誒。

438
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:32,730
而作為議員嘅我哋，根本係冇其他嘅方法可以改變到呢個調整機制。

439
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:26,730
相關嘅法例咧，都冇可能去揾到一個有關頂類物價指數嘅條文，並進行修訂。

440
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:55,200
我哋係無方法去修訂相關嘅調整機制，所以只有咧係通過中止代續，逼政府去自行調整。

441
01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:06,290
不過簡單講就係物價指數同律師樓嘅運作成本有好大分別，並唔能夠反映呢個事實。

442
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:05,130
我亦都唔能夠奢望政府會自動自覺喺委員會裏邊咧自行入修正案去改善呢個收費水平。政府而家係點咧？係拖字決。

443
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:47,920
誒多謝陶錦新議員之前發現話，我分析呢個調整機制分析得即係好詳盡啊。一個丙類物價指數，朱凱迪議員就話我，不過就話其實唔係啊，其實個基數嘅問題。當然我哋知道基數同埋。

444
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:20,650
繼續，我諗啊，局長啊，局長嘅代表都繼續會話研究研究誒收費嘅合理水平，結果係點咧？結果就係兩年、兩年又兩年，兩年之後上嚟又係重複同樣嘅對白。

445
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:45,580
事實上，我亦都十分懷疑議員能唔能夠係隨意去修改呢個規則之中嘅各種收費水平，因為大家都知道，亦熟悉議事規則，熟悉基本法。如果調高收費水平，最後係要發還處以公堂去支付嘅，因此相關嘅修訂咧必然係牽涉。

446
01:24:45,580 --> 01:25:05,590
增加政府開支，我一講到誒增加政府開支，咁咪要行政長官批准先至可以提嘅。眾所周知，政府又點會支持議員提出牽涉增加公堂開支嘅修正案呢？故此，我哋又唔能夠透過修訂去改善現有嗰個收費情。

447
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:25,600
況，所以抗俊宇議員提出呢個終止代續議案，係一個最接近嘅一個方法。第二係調整機制只能由政府自行去改動。另一個支持終止代續嘅原因係，我哋只能夠透過終止代續去逼政府去改善調整機制。

448
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:47,020
如果我哋自行喺規例或者法例之中加入條文，以改動呢個調整機制，政府就可能好似我頭先話啦，即係增加政府開支就唔畀啦。因此，其實只有政府嘅自己先至可以改善到呢個調整機制，只有政府先至可以將相關嘅文件再交嚟財委會去審議或者通過。

449
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,020
從而獲得。

450
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:28,900
係一個。

451
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,750
律師咧就係叫佢。

452
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:26,570
唔求議員去支持呢一個規則。

453
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:39,780
我唔係批評個法援律師嘅質素去深入討論，但係因。

454
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:35,200
重病嘅病人，嚇佢一個醫療失誤嘅申訴，要靠法院。

455
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,970
第三係中止代續，可以加強政府改善收費機制嘅決心。

456
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:26,870
其實咧，呢個都唔單止係量嘅問題，係質嘅問題。呢個我咧真係要講兩句。我前前兩日接接咗一個個案。

457
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:07,650
唔深入講啦。第四，如果中止代續，唔中止代續嘅話咧，真係有機會係改善無期嘅。點解叫改善無期咧？

458
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:39,250
咁政府就會盡快尋求議員去支持，會作甚至乎咧係會作出一個大幅調整，包括調整個基數，同埋令到佢更加接近市價。

459
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:42,620
嘅嘛，咁兩年之後係咩世界咧？兩年之後，如果政府佢要增加收費水平或者降低收費收費水平，佢就會再提交好似今日我哋眼前嘅類似嘅議案啊，但係。

460
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:57,480
你唔可以追咁多樣嘢㗎，你要承諾我唔追A、B、A、B、C、D，我就幫你做E啦。咁個病人係覺得非常之委屈，係因為係咪睇餸食飯咧？係咪因為錢錢少所以唔做咧？

461
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:56,510
加上咧係改善嗰個調整機制，引入咧一籃子嘅因素嚟到評估收費嘅調整幅度，而唔係單單靠丙類物價消費指數。所以，如果中止待續嘅議案通過，政府唔能夠盡快改動現行機制。

462
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:22,950
因為今日議員去提出終止代續嘅議案，係屬於議員議案啦。噉啊，功能組別、地區直選都要過半咧，先至可以過到呢個議案嘅。如果終止代續獲得通過嘅話，而政府希望每兩年調整一次收費嘅機制係可以行之有效咧，就一定要尋。

463
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:18,310
重新獲得我哋立法會嘅支持咧，咁收費就唔能夠上調啦。收費唔能夠上調咧，就好可能出現越嚟越少律師參與發還計劃，發還制度咧，因此就會受到嚴重嘅威脅，甚至係冇足夠嘅律師為刑事發還個案咧提供服務。

464
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:11,120
我好。

465
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:33,300
講多幾句。

466
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:43,090
嗰啲台詞，嗰啲對白。

467
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:49,700
我哋點能夠去支持含淚投票支持佢？我都覺得。

468
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:27,660
第六係，而家我哋尚有充足嘅時間去重新審議呢一條規則。

469
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:20,890
我歡迎你哋提出，但係呢個時機真係可一不可再，一瞬即逝。我希望大家係積極考慮。

470
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:20,760
個同個市場係脱節，但我哋真係做唔到其他其他嘢，係叫有效嘅嘢去逼政府做。如果而家呢個機會，呢個中止代做嘅機會，我哋唔做。兩年之後政府唔提，佢話唔使調整，佢唔提議案。

471
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:28,150
因為正如我剛才講第一、第二個原因嘅時候提到，議員係無法通過修正案咧，係處理呢一個誒收費水平嘅調整機制。如果我哋唔趁住呢個時候逼政府，咁又要繼續等多兩年㗎？點解啊？因為呢個收費機制嘅調整係兩年一次。

472
01:29:42,900 --> 01:30:02,910
政府係有權唔調整嘅，佢有權。以前都試過咧，有一兩次咧係唔調整嘅。咁如果唔調整咧，佢係議案都唔使提出嚟㗎，即係唔係兩年、兩年又兩年，以為我哋等多兩年。我記得何君瑤啊、周浩鼎議員都有都有即係提過話，誒都係覺得呢。

473
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:41,050
咁點咧？所以就算你哋唔支持呢個終止代眾，我都希望你哋發言逼政府最少係承諾兩年之後係要提議案，係要檢討機數、檢討調整機制。如果佢呢樣嘢都唔肯講，今日都講唔到，仲係重複翻佢之前嗰啲。

474
01:30:49,980 --> 01:31:09,990
係唔應該嘅嗱，主席，你可能會話議員可以透過議員議案，又或者事務委員會嘅場合啊，繼續去討論啊相關嘅嘅問題。但係呢個討論係冇用㗎，對政府係冇作用、冇壓力㗎。事務委員會又好，我排條議員議。

475
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:31,410
係推動唔到政府去承諾做任何嘢㗎。就算佢今日唔改，佢一陣間最少都有啲承諾，有啲大方向嘅承諾，你哋先至好投反對終止代罪又好，反支持佢呢個原議案又好。呢個係個良機，係逼政府去講多最少唔做都要。

476
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:53,640
第五係現時係上調收費同改善調整機制嘅最佳時機。點解咁講？嚇，最近幾年香港經濟都係蓬勃發展，林鄭月娥參選都話，而家我哋庫房大把錢，係而家唔做，等到幾時？等到經濟逆轉嘅時候，你先至。

477
01:31:53,640 --> 01:32:13,650
再同佢話喂，可唔可以加法換錢啊？噉樣唔會係噉樣啊。咁而家佢到時佢更加唔會聽我哋我哋嘅要求啦。所以把握時機，我哋能夠做到嘅乜嘢嘢，支持呢個中止代助係其中一個方法。如果有議員有其他更有效嘅方法，

478
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:47,950
我支持中止代續嘅原因就係各位應該知道，法援嘅收費水平係每兩年修改一次嘅。下次咧就二零一九，但係呢個附屬法例咧並冇明確嘅生效日期，全由政府決定。如果我哋提出中止代續並獲得通過嘅話咧，政府為咗爭取我。

479
01:32:47,950 --> 01:33:07,960
我哋支持，可能咧有機會會大幅修訂呢條附屬法例，並且重新經過事務委員會去審議。我相信大家啲律師低個市價都咁耐啦，啊，真係你呢啲捱二係捱咁耐，捱多幾個月都唔會有太大嘅問題嚇，捱遠呢幾。

480
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,650
個月。

481
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,480
機制。

482
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:10,470
國家奇緣。

483
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,400
陳志全業。

484
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:38,420
係受一次教訓。

485
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,570
議廳未有足夠法定人數。

486
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,970
誒覺得唔應該使啲。

487
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:19,560
嘅新個開支，但係頭先你聽到咧，包括啊亢進議員同埋大多數嘅議員咧，唔係。

488
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:54,250
主席，我係發言咧，係對於啊，鄺俊宇議員提出嗰個啊終止代續咧，係表示不能同意。不過我係明白佢個苦衷嘅，主席。

489
01:48:54,720 --> 01:49:11,460
呢一條條例咧喺二零一七刑事法誒案件法律援助修訂條例咧，其實原本我哋係需要咧係去支持嚇，即係而家講緊都係好少嘅錢，加咗百分之四咧係得七百萬。

490
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:36,430
請各位議員返回座位。係多謝主席。我係講到第六個原因，點解我要支持由康俊議員提出嘅終止待續議案，就係而家我哋尚有充足嘅時間去重新審議呢條規例。誒，由於現時咧要審議嘅政府法案同埋附屬法例有限，你睇成個月。

491
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:56,440
咧，政府都冇新法案、新議案排上嚟，就知道啦。所以咧，就算我哋中止咗呢條議案，喺二零一八年年初再交上立法會咧，都應該可以喺一兩個會議裏邊咧係獲得通過嘅。相反，如果我哋而家唔做呢樣嘢，要等到。

492
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:16,450
到二零一九年再調整嘅時候至做咧，到時嚟立法會換屆又得翻一年，可能有大量嘅法案去累積啊，包括可能啊廿三條重臨啊噉樣，我哋就好難喺二零二零年七月前咧係處理。因此咧，我希望大家把握呢個檔期啊，終止代續呢條法例，等政府咧。

493
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:36,460
係喺比較少法案要大會處理嘅時間咧，可以修定翻呢條誒規例，再交畀我哋審議，盡快將不合理嘅收費同埋個調整機制去改善。第七個原因咧，就係我哋要令到政府知道漠視民意嘅後果，要政府咧。

494
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:58,710
如果今次呢個終止代續議案獲得歷史性通過，政府就可以體會到漠視民意嘅惡果。過去廿幾年，唔少議員已經指出收費嘅基數過低，長期遠離市場水平，但係政府係充耳不聞，視而不見。上星期會議，唔少議員都指出咗調整。

495
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:19,880
嘅問題，政府當耳邊風，政府可以毫無代價噉樣漠視民意。佢喺日後調整收費嘅時候，可以繼續都係充耳不聞。議員提出嘅訴求點解叫浪費時間咧？浪費時間就係我哋講咗好多嘢，好有道理，但係政府都唔聽。

496
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:39,890
政府都係一意孤行，連兩年一次跟住丙類物價指數去調整，唔檢討個基數，唔檢討個調整機制。最後第八個原因就係，如果大家聽到好悶，覺得呢個話題講夠，噉你支持咗中止代續，咪唔使講落去咯。本人僅此陳辭。國家奇緣。

497
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:03,730
不能。

498
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,240
我哋而家見得到嘅。

499
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,560
七百萬，或者增加百分之四。

500
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,940
誒，休會待續係逼令咧。

501
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:33,770
但係現實生活，我哋見得到咧，就係。

502
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:30,130
為嗰個費用係幾微薄咧，佢哋都可可以去做。

503
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,900
而係唔能夠咧，係接受呢一個水平。

504
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:06,460
誒大律師或者係誒。

505
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:42,580
啊，無論係律師或者大律師咧，佢哋係經營嗰個成本咧，係確實好大。

506
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:18,740
嗰個時間未必係最長嘅律師咧，去參與呢個發換計劃咧，我擔心嘅咧就係後繼無人。

507
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:11,580
咁如果我哋冇法子吸引到一啲年輕嘅，或者係誒年個職業，

508
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:39,040
而亢進議員提出嘅，佢話要終止代續咧，佢有個呼籲，呢個我亦都相當同意。佢係希望咧透過呢一個。

509
01:49:53,210 --> 01:50:02,310
而家嗰個新嘅水平咧，係增加百分之四，係冇法子係能夠吸引到足夠數量嘅。

510
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:52,340
係政府，即係而家就民政事務局局長劉江華咧，係能夠翻去，係將呢一個新嘅水平咧，係重新去釐定。

511
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:26,970
其他嘅辯護律師咧，係為呢一啲係有需要嘅人士咧，係辯護。咁好多人會去誒去講啦，佢話唔係，其實香港都有好多有心人咧，係去為呢一啲需要發緩嘅人士，無論佢幾冇錢，或者政府畀出嘅所謂。

512
01:50:43,140 --> 01:51:03,150
舉個例，佢哋喺承擔呢一個高昂嘅租金，承擔呢個高昂嘅人誒人人工嘅開支嗰度咧，其實令到好多誒大律師律師，特別係誒係執業時間比較短嗰啲，係的確有好大嘅困。

513
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,120
發問。

514
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,680
都落一腳。

515
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,240
連政府。

516
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,650
嘅善良嘅市民。

517
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,920
誒佔中之後嘅秋後算賬咧。

518
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,470
我哋見得到，而家越嚟越多嘅咧，就係。

519
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:36,520
噉啊！我係有啲唔同意。

520
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:40,370
經過東北嘅案件。

521
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:22,620
大法援特別係刑事嘅法援咧，係越嚟越需要。

522
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:17,760
法律援助處同埋法援嘅開支嗰部分嘅時候，可能都係用同一個理由咧，係推卻嘅。

523
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:30,280
可有啲人講佢話：而家嘅刑事嘅援助，只係對於少數。

524
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:49,360
咁有啲情況，有啲人就話：，誒唔緊要啊，你過咗先算啦，將來將來嘅事啦，噉我係唔同意。

525
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:00,280
係會將一啲佢唔高興嘅、唔中意嘅，或者佢要打壓嘅人咧，係透過刑事檢控程序咧，將佢捉上去法庭。

526
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:41,190
啊！退休之後咧，其實剩翻落嚟咧，就係我哋需要一啲中層或者係年輕嘅律師大律師咧，係為呢一啲弱勢嘅社羣咧，係去出聲。

527
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:30,390
當呢一啲唔需要係靠政府微薄嘅所謂嗰個發緩嘅開支嘅一個個嘅資深嘅律師同埋大律師咧。

528
01:51:50,430 --> 01:52:10,440
因為如果過咗先算噉，政府好多時就過咗可以係神仙嘅。大家都唔係一致聽過咧，就政府無論啊，而家嘅劉光華局長或者將來咧，就轉到去政務司司長嗰個政策啊，嗰個下邊嘅要處理呢一個嗯。

529
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,650
有學生啦。

530
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:46,570
噉，但係去抗辯嘅咧。

531
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,590
啊，增幅！請你翻翻嚟呢個辯論。係，我係。

532
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:28,640
對於一個強大嘅政府，

533
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:09,270
咁咧就用一個高昂嘅費用去對。

534
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:58,500
司法誒嘅法律人員啦，佢而家用到咧，動不動都用一啲海外。

535
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:34,080
有數以萬億計嘅資源，可以聘用。

536
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:46,550
誒講出我點解要反對啊！抗進議員嗰個動議咧，係要停佢。

537
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:07,040
而好多呢一啲嘅人士，包括最近嘅東北案，大家見得到咧，佢哋都係孤立無援嘅人。

538
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:05,080
嘅外援啊，或者甚至係香港一啲嘅超級升級大狀，即係收好多錢嗰啲咧。

539
01:53:47,230 --> 01:53:53,590
係唔等唔對等嘅喎，當我哋見到政府好多時，唔係淨係律政署嘅。

540
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:25,200
如果冇咗法援嘅協助，佢又有啲乜嘢嘅能力？有咩資格去抗辯咧？

541
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:17,330
一個弱勢嘅被控嘅人士，而好多被控嘅人士咧，除咗佢係刑事罪犯之外，好多係。

542
01:53:09,130 --> 01:53:17,880
有收入係極之低微，係根本連佢哋自己喺而家今時今日香港都好難咧，能能夠咧立足嘅人。

543
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:43,600
啊！好多喺海外飛嚟嘅資深大狀，啊幾百萬一日嘅資深大狀，佢哋係眼都唔眨就可以去請。

544
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:37,620
係喺社會入邊係為咗抗爭一個不公義嘅政府，不公義嘅政策。國席議員誒，求先代理主席已經講得好清楚咧。誒，而家依個動議係講啲乜嘢嘢？我哋唔係講緊法嘅制度，我係講緊點解我反對百分之四嘅誒。

545
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:54,910
就唔係呢一個水平。

546
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:06,090
個原意啊！

547
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:46,970
啊，於理不合。

548
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:33,040
嚇！無論係建制、泛民都齊心嘅咧。

549
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:07,340
噉我哋先至可以令到將來有多啲人保障。

550
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:44,970
政府，劉劉江華咧將呢一個。

551
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:12,740
家家有求，我唔知幾時啊，有好多其他嘅。

552
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:11,280
個目的好好清楚，主席佢話希望透過畀一個壓力。

553
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:53,010
因為我覺得係要越早咧，係去定咗呢個修訂條例。不過，

554
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:40,570
係否決咗呢一個不合理嘅誒收費調整嘅政策嘅話咧，其實有機會逼啊！

555
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:33,970
噉啊！所以如果喺呢個情況底下，如果大家都一齊，當然要一齊啦嚇！大家都知道今日嘅立法會咧。

556
01:54:56,410 --> 01:55:03,930
頭先我講到就係好多而家係孤立無援嘅人咧，佢係靠發援咧係去做嘅，而抗進議員。

557
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:43,190
係建制派當道嘅，噉我哋好難咧，係透過即係一啲即係良好意願咧，就可以諗得到咧。

558
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:26,420
啊！人士就唔係民主派嗰啲啦，好好可能將來都係啲建制派嗰啲嘅朋友咧，都係需要依賴咧發緩嘅。我知道佢哋咧，都好多都係為弱勢嚇去發聲嘅。

559
01:55:47,360 --> 01:56:02,730
亦都係對於而家好多係幫緊手打緊呢一啲官司嘅誒律師同埋大律師係不公平嘅一啲嘅發換嘅收嘅嘅收費係咪收費發換嘅一個誒畀出嚟嘅經費咧？

560
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:29,250
令到政府係要主動收翻佢，或者透過如果成功啊喺晏少少或者今日啦，或者稍後嘅時間投票，我希望當然係多啲人士考慮啦，即係多啲人，如果大家齊心嘅。

561
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:06,000
再加上。

562
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,170
誒意味喺度嘅。

563
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:35,600
做法咧係佢。

564
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,950
有一定嘅嗯理據嘅。

565
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:57,050
假設就係政府不能夠獲得通過。

566
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:09,980
有人講過，包括係兩年一檢唔滿意啦。

567
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:53,640
嘅話咧，我會假設嘅後果係點？

568
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:13,100
嗰把刀已經喺香港人頭上嘅，隨時都會嚟嘅。二十三條立法，甚至國歌法，有啲。

569
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:34,050
情況而一啲方法唔係好似唔用腦噉樣跟住個餅類物發物價消費。

570
01:58:34,330 --> 01:58:41,780
誒嗰個價格而調升嘅一啲個做法，可唔可以考慮加入一啲中立嘅人士？

571
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:51,160
就建制派會去去咁做，但係今次嘅法援嘅調整收費咧，確實又唔應該有政治嘅。

572
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:06,540
而喺過去咁長嘅一個時間，無論係邊一邊嘅議員都提出嘅，對而家個制度咧表示唔滿意嘅。

573
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:50,110
而如果能夠真係好彩咧，主席係將呢一個修訂，即係啊抗議員提出嘅宗旨咧，係真係做得到。

574
01:56:53,450 --> 01:57:04,390
因為正如我哋講，真正係需要係誒動用呢一個發緩嘅人士，冇分佢哋嘅背景嘅。當然而家睇嚟咧。

575
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:26,760
有唔少嘅評論認為，而家根據丙類消費物價指數嘅上升咧，不合時宜啦。亦都希望咧係有一個比較客觀而務實嘅一個審定嘅標準，包括係需要有係一啲。

576
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:33,390
人咧嚇有啲親中人士，仲要係講緊咧係要有追索力嘅。我唔知將來有幾多香港人咧係被捉上法院法庭。誒，唔知有幾多人咧係需要國家旗員？你離題啦，請你翻翻嚟。咗，我我翻翻嚟繼續離題嘅。我所以呢一個咧，抗進議員嘅要求呢一個。

577
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:11,540
拎翻嚟。

578
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:28,790
我哋喺。

579
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:53,540
因為只要政府咧，

580
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:35,860
我係寄望咧，就係。

581
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:22,450
喺本會咧，係通過嘅。

582
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:56,610
係肯從善如流。

583
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,830
就可以將呢一個新嘅政策咧。

584
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:26,190
咁呢個其實唔係更加好、更加適當咩？

585
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,400
倘若係能夠終止咗之後咧，

586
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:46,190
係喺呢一個定定呢一個水平嗰度咧，做多啲嘢。

587
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:16,220
係可能需就係需要好短嘅時間，係極速啊！

588
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:51,350
主席拎翻去之後，有冇一啲惡果咧？噉我又唔係好睇得到。

589
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:09,550
誒調整嗰個幅度咧，拎翻嚟再傾咧，我相信咧。

590
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:04,320
喺抗議員提出嘅宗旨之後咧，係能夠啊，係將呢一個。

591
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:48,220
啊，無論係民政事務局、法援處，同埋最重要咧就係法律界嘅人士。其中咧，我覺得一定要係包括一啲係前線嘅律師同埋大律師。

592
01:59:48,700 --> 02:00:03,140
佢哋咧係飽受咧喺香港經營嘅困難，同埋佢嘅成本上升嘅影響。當然我亦都希望咧，自己嘅理據，請你翻翻嚟啊。係主席，我翻緊嚟啊，係需要有一啲嘅人士咧。

593
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:38,180
一個機制。

594
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,220
係能夠向佢哋咧去做嘅。

595
02:01:32,730 --> 02:01:35,520
呢一個修訂動議嘅做法。

596
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:09,540
咁如果能夠係將呢一個，

597
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:38,810
但係當然咧，如果另外一個角度嘅主席，

598
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:36,500
主席，我哋而家見得到嘅就係。

599
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:18,080
佢冇斷然拒絕政府咧，係會生集，即係話當呢一個。

600
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:21,180
不過點樣去令到終止係喺呢一個立法會去做咧，好睏難。

601
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:15,540
誒終止係過咗嘅話咧，我相信咧呢一樣嘢係可以做到。

602
02:01:39,450 --> 02:01:45,580
當我哋支持咗之後，而嗰個最終政府又唔改，又點算咧？咁

603
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:44,650
即係話呢一個升幅嘅機制，能唔能夠有一個改善嘅方法？睇嚟而家冇。

604
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:25,120
終止案係不能夠獲級通過之後咧，政府唔會咧係拎翻去去再。

605
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:32,310
再作一步嘅進一步嘅檢視，然後再拎翻嚟，呢一個就係正正點解我哋要支持。

606
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:12,780
胡光華局長係回應亢進議員嗰部分咧，其實佢係冇斷言咧，係拒絕嘅。

607
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:32,780
誒郭語言，你再重複緊你嘅論據，因為你已經講咗兩三次㗎啦。如果你冇新嘅論據嘅，請你停止發言。唔係，我有新嘅論據，你等我聽，等我講。

608
02:00:45,060 --> 02:01:05,070
如果而家冇嘅話，我哋只可以喺喺利用本會嘅程序咧，係令到政府係能夠再一次拎翻出嚟去做。而呢一個亦都係點解鄺進議員提出喺今次中止嘅原因。我有留意到喺個辯論入邊嚟講咧，包括頭先啊劉。

609
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:38,910
嗯。

610
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:43,930
受益嘅。

611
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:53,830
對住小人。

612
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,740
係社會上。

613
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,150
事與願違。

614
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,250
噉我係明白嘅，但係。

615
02:03:32,130 --> 02:03:35,760
係拎翻呢一個不合理嘅政策，翻去重新定定。

616
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:49,540
有啲人講呢個咪變咗令我哋枉作小人啦噉。

617
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:57,290
係會誒唔去從翻抗進議員個諗法去去諗。

618
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:42,290
而最終個目的咧，就唔係益咗咩人嘅，主席。最終如果能夠成功嘅話咧，

619
02:01:54,430 --> 02:02:04,490
對住政府，噉我又又諗唔到有啲咩方法可以逼佢，因為而家咧，我哋好難係靠我哋嘅一己之力可以去做。

620
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:37,770
我係見得到，去到今時今日，去到最後，當我哋冇法子靠一個法案委員會，當我哋冇法子靠一啲更加好嘅方法嘅時候，去將呢一個。

621
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:51,700
要求係重新拎翻嚟，用一個重新嘅計劃拎翻嚟，立法會盡快通過係可切實可行嘅情況底下咧，我係好難咧。

622
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:11,690
亦都我見得到咧，喺本會入邊咧，晏啲跟住我發言咧，都有好多嘅誒法律界嘅人士嚇噉啊。我亦都好想聽下佢哋咧，可唔可以講講一啲公道嘅説話？因為如果跟住落嚟嘅議員啊，

623
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:24,780
我哋需要用個制度去做原本咧喺呢一條法例咧拎出嚟嘅時候，如果能夠有多啲嘅討論咧，我相信咧係唔需要去到今時今日去咁做。原本咧喺定呢個制度嘅時候更加公平公正，我哋唔需要喺呢個立法會去到呢一步咧去做。但係可惜，我哋見到嘅情況就係。

624
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:32,130
包括係特別建制派嘅議員啊，我聽到我見到可能跟住嚟就係阿阿梁美芬議員啦。咁如果佢都係同意啊，佢作為法律界嘅人士係覺得政府呢個做法係不可取嘅話咧，其實佢應該同我哋一齊咧係聯手，係逼翻咧係民政事務局。

625
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:19,920
主席。

626
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,160
弱勢。

627
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,350
我發言咧係反對。

628
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:06,060
但係呢啲唔係喺今日呢個場合再要討論。

629
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:30,220
喺公眾嚟講，都仲有好多地方需要改善。

630
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:27,470
而家仲係用四十括弧一終止代續。

631
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:51,030
嗱，呢一啲嘅問題有好長遠，大家好多時候咧都要去進行好深入嘅分析。

632
02:05:51,310 --> 02:06:01,650
我亦都提過咧，就係話喂，可唔可以咧？好似公立醫院噉樣去改變我哋嘅法律援助制度，大家所有嗰啲嘅律師大律師嚇係要輪崗嘅。

633
02:03:47,440 --> 02:04:02,000
孤立無援係冇法子透過自己一己之力咧，係對抗龐大嘅一個檢控機器。特別喺呢個時候，我哋唔知有幾多控罪，包括咧一啲公民抗命咧，係被拎上法庭。

634
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:17,800
一個公平公正嘅社會，一個公平公正嘅法治咧，唔係講嘅啫，佢要需要有行動嘅。我希望喺最後嘅發言同埋投票之係有多啲人支持抗進議員。本人謹此陳辭，多謝。

635
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:23,400
向去走，因為事實上法律援助嘅制度究竟朝向邊個方向，正正就係仍然未有共識。但係喺法律援助刑事援助嗰個資源上，願意大家增加咧，呢個幾乎係冇爭議嘅。

636
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:42,860
所以咧，主席，我都要申報啦，因為我係執業嘅大律師，亦都係主要咧係做得多啲嘅咧係內地同埋香港嘅法律紛爭。曾經咧好多年啦，希望提出咧法律援助，裡面可以係幫助到一啲喺內地遇到法律問題嘅香港永久性居民。

637
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:48,050
主席點解要講清楚咧？就係因為我哋反對嘅議員咧，其實唔等於咧，我哋係唔要嗰個法律援助整個制度咧要改革。正正咧就喺星期一啊，啱啱過咗嘅司法及法律事務委員會，我哋就住法律援助嘅制度咧係進行咗好詳細嘅辯論。

638
02:04:48,050 --> 02:05:08,060
好詳細嘅討論，亦都顯示咧。其實，如果你係要講到成個法律援助制度點樣去改善咧，就絕對唔係好似陳志全議員頭先噉樣講話。喂，我哋而家咧就中止咗而家呢一個嘅議案，半年之後政府咧就會妥協，或者政府就會隨你哋提出嘅方。

639
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:26,350
因為牽涉到刑事法律援助嗰啲律師嗰個誒，即係資助嘅問題咧，係成個法律界咧都係好希望盡快有所推進。即係我認為你要分開兩個場合去討論。而家我哋冇錯講緊嘅係串進嘅問題，成個法律援助制度。

640
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:51,310
但係如果你而家用終子代續嘅形式畀到社會嘅信息，就仲差，就好似喺度等待果陀，已經係有共識。你知我哋好難係有共識嘅，有一啲部分，正如我提出嘅嗰兩個方向，可能喺法律界都仲要有排討論嘅。但係我哋要面向嘅係普

641
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:39,690
佢話乜嘢咧？佢話。

642
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:08,100
係大約百分之四依個變動嘅。

643
02:10:56,460 --> 02:11:00,060
該委員會對建議增幅不持異議。

644
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:16,040
應該咧就係直斥其非，呢樣嘢佢根本就搞錯咗。

645
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:21,020
其實係可以讓政府更加做咗去，更加應該做嘅工作嘅，就係點樣去完善而家依個制度。咁所以第一點咧，我覺得係誒依個宗旨係冇問題，亦都係可以支持。

646
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:29,920
根本就唔會喺終止代續之後就會有任何嘅串進，唔會改革到嚇噉，簡直你就只係將嗰樣嘢係停滯不前嘅啫。主席本人僅此陳辭，你要中意。

647
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:55,910
著我們已就事前檢測結果，支援法律援助服務局、香港大師公會和律師會。我們亦於二零一六年十二月諮詢司法及法律事務委員會。

648
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:37,870
而第二點咧話咧，我點解亦都會支持一個嘅議案咧？噉樣樣咁咧，其實咧就係有一個好重要嘅做法，有有重重要觀點嘅，就喺誒我哋啊我哋嘅司長啊啊局長咧，佢喺原先發言嗰時咧，佢講過一段説話嘅。

649
02:06:51,310 --> 02:07:11,320
普羅大眾嘅期望，即係大家唔好喺呢個時候係用一個幾乎係冇爭議嘅一個議案嚟拉布。冇錯，我係認為大家係拉布。我亦都覺得我哋反對派嘅議員已經係黔累技窮啊，即係冇方法啦。所以咧，就係嘢都拎。

650
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:31,330
跟住嚟休會待續，終止待續呢一樣嘢，你哋係辜負咗市民嘅期望，亦都辜負咗我哋法律界好多嘅同業。其實特別一啲新嘅即係誒入行嘅律師，其實大家都希望加到幾多就幾多，並唔係你講即係終止待續之後半年成個package。

651
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:51,340
就可以出嚟，係唔會㗎嘛。所以我希望咧，你都係信下，即係你哋而家噉樣搞法咧，就係犧牲咗市民大眾嘅利益，甚至犧牲咗法律援助喺刑事嘅呢一方面可以有串進。我希望咧，大家唔好用錯藥，甚至係食錯藥。

652
02:07:51,340 --> 02:08:11,350
唔好搞彎，而家所有可以一點一滴推進早法律援助制度嘅改變，所以咧，主席本人係反對終止代續，更加係希望跟住嚟嘅議員即係唔好再苟纏喺用終止代續應。

653
02:08:45,700 --> 02:09:05,710
主席，相信咧個原議案咧大家都好清楚啦，就話要將一個嘅就兩年一度嘅檢討有關上訴律師費，咁咧就特別針對住就係法律援助處啦，同埋咧亦都係針對住依個嘅當事律師噉樣樣嘅，咁而調整嘅數字咧就根據依個丙類嘅消費物消費物價指數上升。

654
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:28,390
噉啊，主席噉啊，抗進議議員咧就提出一個終止呢一個議案。咁點解要終止議案咧？噉佢講咗意見啦，噉我就或者唔重複佢講嘅意見。咁不過咧，我想講講咧，就點解我會係覺得佢終止議案咧係有意思咧，同埋我支持咧。咁第一點咧，我覺得咧就係終止個議案咧同終。

655
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:48,400
中止其他議案有少少唔同嘅，第一個就係話喺其實過去兩年咧，好多律師都係收緊呢個舊嘅收費嘅。如果我中止呢個議案嘅話咧，咁即係話咧，法律援助處就唔會根據呢個新嘅調升咧，呢個呢個變動咧，而畀新嘅律師費畀一個法律援助或者畀一個嘅誒當事律師嘅噉。

656
02:09:48,400 --> 02:10:08,410
佢哋會唔會影響到佢哋唔會接受依官司再打落去咧？相信係唔會嘅。佢仍然都會係咧，根據住舊嗰個嘅數字咧，舊嗰個律師費裏邊咧係繼續去誒進行依一個嘅訴訟。咁所以對社會嚟講話咧，變動唔會大，影響亦都唔會大。咁所以中止咗之後嘅話咧。

657
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:04,470
即係話咧，其實政府咧係曾經去做過諮詢嘅。

658
02:11:04,930 --> 02:11:14,930
但係一個問題在於咧，好可惜政府所諮詢咧係某部分嘅持份者啫，就係包括咗大師公會啦，同埋律師公會。

659
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:27,490
增埋其他區議會，咁咧讓一個個嘅誒意見咧能夠更加充分，呢個係第二個，我覺得係誒誒誒終止個個理由嚟嘅。

660
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:36,500
佢好了解啲市民咧對呢個呢個服務咧嗰啲嘅意見，噉樣嘅話咧，如果你聽到呢意見嘅話咧，而係進行呢個調幅嘅話咧，我諗嚟講會係有效果嘅。

661
02:11:15,210 --> 02:11:29,070
但係，如果當係講持份者咧，就唔單止係呢兩部分喎。其實好多市民大眾，佢要係可能有機會接受呢一個嘅法律援助或者當作律師服務嘅時候咧，嗰啲持份者更加重要。

662
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:43,710
點解咧？因為如果律師費喺呢個嘅法律援助同埋當事人資料度咧，能夠可以提高嘅話咧，咁嗰個嘅相信佢哋處理嗰個案件嘅情況面咧，會有所唔同嘅。

663
02:11:44,060 --> 02:12:04,070
嗱，我或者而家唔先講一個嘅法律援助先啦，我先講當事律師啦。其實佢哋咧嗰個嘅服務裏邊嚟講，或者頭先我咁大多數同事都可能都講過，或者過去之都講過，就係當事律師咧，就係只係案件即係聆訊之前十五分鐘見一見個當事人，噉就畀出個法律意見。

664
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:24,080
出嚟嘅，呢一個咧都已經好多人提咗，同埋放車去唔係話點解中止嘅理由。請你翻翻嚟呢個。唔係就係之前我解釋點解咁講咧，因為我講緊就係頭先我講咗佢諮詢嘅範疇咧，係只係諮詢咗大師工會同香港律師會，但係冇去諮詢一啲嘅另外持份者，另外持份者就就係。

665
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:44,090
市民市民大眾噉，市民大眾呢樣嘢咧就係接受緊醫律師嗰個嘅誒服服服務嘅。咁由於嗰個收費咧唔理想嘅話咧，因此於制度上高就出現咗一個現象喺度咧，影響咗受服務者嗰個嘅服務嘅。噉我覺得咧，當然如果要求呢個嘅誒政府當。

666
02:12:44,090 --> 02:13:04,100
當局去進行諮詢，諮詢曬所有嗰啲嘅誒另一方面受服受服務嘅人咧，就好睏難嘅，因為咧都唔知邊個有機會受服務，或者邊個咧係會需要依啲嘅誒誒誒誒支援噉樣樣。咁所以我覺得咧，最得限度，最得限度咧，如果我哋能夠終止個議案嘅話咧，政府係咪需要運？

667
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:24,110
一啲就係諮詢多一啲嘅誒誒誒誒團體或者機構咧，能夠讓讓佢哋喺呢一個檢討當中能夠更加多啲充分理由去處理呢件呢件事咧。譬如舉例子嚟講，我覺得政府應該去諮詢下區議會啦，因為區議會啲區議員咧係同市民接觸係最多㗎啦。

668
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:56,790
咁所以，我覺得咧，如果能夠中止咗呢個議案咧，其實唔會花好多時間啫。全港嘅區議會，你每一個區議會去一次，咁翻嚟就可以攞埋呢個諮詢咧，就可以進行一個噉嘅調整。而頭先我講過啦，就係調整快與慢咧，對而家個服務咧，相信唔會好大影響嘅，因為咁多兩年過去兩年。

669
02:13:56,790 --> 02:14:16,800
啦，都係用依個嘅收費嚟到進行服務嘅。如果再諮詢埋依個區議會嘅話咧，嚟攞多依一個嘅嘅意見翻嚟，然後再睇下係咪依個噉嘅條幅係最合理嘅話咧，噉我覺得係咪更加好咧？咁所以一點上高咧，我會係支持咧，係中止一個嘅議案咧，讓政府抽啲時間去諮。

670
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:47,890
咁第三個咧理由咧就係誒，剛才咧就啊林碧芬議員都講過啦，而家嘅制度咧，大家咧都誒不爭議地咧，對於制度上咗好多批評，好多意見。咁其實咧誒需要係修改嘅。只不過嘅話咧，就唔係喺而家呢個時間，亦都唔喺依度，係另外應該喺。

671
02:14:47,890 --> 02:15:07,900
另外啲場合噉，我都同意嘅，冇意義上高噉。但係問題在於喺過去喺另一場合裏邊嚟講話咧，呢啲意見唔係冇反映過，但係政府可惜咧聽唔聽咧，只冇聽過咁多年都冇見通過噉，所以而家我覺得咧喺呢個時候再畀一次機會政府咯。我再中止咗之後嘅話咧。

672
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:27,910
畀政府再嚟一個嚟一個，即係佢重新反省一下，會唔會係覺得係需要修改咧？呢個反而係重要咯，因為以前都試過啦。咁好啦，以前試過，可唔可以試埋今次咧？噉樣樣，讓政府真係喺一個噉嘅嘅時刻裏邊咧，諗一諗，然後大家都覺得係喂真係喎！

673
02:19:04,850 --> 02:19:08,290
誒，我真係想講多句啫，主席。

674
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:51,470
咁主席，仲有最後一點咧，我想講講咧，就係。

675
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:56,010
特別係有關當事律師嗰個制度問題。

676
02:18:56,340 --> 02:19:04,570
即係當做律師嗰邊嚟講話咧，就係如果我哋唔去提高嗰個嘅嘅誒回報畀佢嗰啲律師嘅話咧。

677
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:37,810
依咁調整咧係唔理想喎，係需要真係再重新諗一諗咁咪好咯，咁咪再去諗一諗咯。其實事實上咧，依個行禮預熱嘅制度咧咁多年。

678
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:47,500
死板唔好咁機械，唔好噉係一種行禮如儀嘅方式嚟去處理一件事，而能夠可以咧係誒誒好好噉樣去處理咧噉樣樣。

679
02:16:48,230 --> 02:17:01,720
但係，而家咁少嘅時候，但係對成個社會服務面咧係好重要嘅，因為點解咧？我係維護一個法律上高嘅一個公平、平等、公義等等嘅問題。

680
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:47,540
就係，如果你加幅加咁少，而嗰個令到成個嘅開支亦都開咁少，咁對成個香港財政運作裏邊咧影響真係好少。

681
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:36,650
如果你話誒個開支好大，影響到成個財政運作嘅話咧，咁當然無需再要諗一諗啦。但係只係咁七百萬嘅額外經常性開支，咁細數字，點解政府？

682
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:33,060
咁咧仲有咧就係政府講到咧就話誒今次咧就係誒誒要開支咧就係誒每年咧各大約七百萬嘅經常性開支噉樣樣。嗱，主席一點咧，我覺得真係咧誒，這宗旨再諗一諗。

683
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:15,720
噉我覺得咧就係最理想檢討，就要要要檢討成個機制，而唔係一個嘅數字。咁所以，我覺得咧，如果中止咗之後嘅話咧，我覺得能夠令到佢可以去真係檢討下依個機制咧，噉我覺得先至恰當同埋係一個誒有作為嘅。

684
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:58,280
用機械式嘅調幅行咗咁多年，政府做咗幾多檢討咧？佢只係話我一每兩年一一度檢討，檢討乜嘢啊？檢討唔係檢討機制，而檢出調幅個數字啫嘛。咁所以個最大問題就係佢呢個檢討唔係一個理想嘅檢討咯。

685
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:22,010
但係點解我哋政府只係用少錢嚟去做呢樣嘢咧？即係額外嘅嘅開支點解唔增加一額外開支，能夠令到一服務更加完善、更加理想啲咧？咁所以我都好希望政府係咪真係可以終止咗呢個議案之後嘅話咧，即係諗一諗，因為。

686
02:17:36,930 --> 02:17:56,940
即係咁使咁手手手指咁緊咧，手咁緊咧，點解唔可以係真係諗得鬆啲咧？讓呢一個嘅誒誒提供服務嘅人咧，能夠得到一個合適嘅合理啲嘅一個嘅誒經濟回報，可以更加做好呢個工作咧。噉我相信頭先好多同事都講過啦。

687
02:17:56,940 --> 02:18:16,950
依個依家而家，無論法院嘅，亦即係當事律師嘅畀嘅費用咧，同呢個市場上高爭佢咧誒誒差距，實在太大太大太大啦。咁既然既然講嘅時候，係咪有需要作出一個嘅拉近嘅嘅工作咧？而今次如果我哋真係畀佢繼續依一個議案誒誒。

688
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:36,960
誒討論落去而係通過嘅話咧，其實畀人鬧嘅，鬧乜嘢？人話你壓位開支咁少，咁搞錯啊？應應開應該大嘅唔大，應該使多啲嘅唔使，噉樣樣。咁所以係咪政府喺呢點上高，都需要諗一諗係咪誒好唔好？即係唔好噉。

689
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:48,310
審判。

690
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:57,250
多謝主席。

691
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,340
制度上高。

692
02:19:48,590 --> 02:19:50,380
我覺得呢個真係唔理想嘅。

693
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:42,940
會構成好多冤案。

694
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:46,970
亦都構成咗好多唔公道嘅。

695
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:19,190
讓政府係重新去考慮一下，究竟無論係從我哋嗰個嘅誒。

696
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:17,070
因為太多太多個案裏邊咧，係當事律師咧係建議啲當事人咧唔好去再打官司啦，不如認罪啦噉樣樣。

697
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:06,540
主席，我明白咧，郭進宇議員今次提出終止代續嘅苦衷嘅，亦都完全理解咧。

698
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:27,920
嗱，依一個咧，你聽到之後好心噏嘅。原來我哋而家依個調整嘅幅度裏邊咧，係可能影響到即係我哋個司法公唔公正嘅。

699
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:39,410
咁咁重要一個嘅嘅情況裏邊嚟講，如果我哋都唔去中止去重新考慮嘅話咧，我覺得我哋只會係。

700
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:55,580
能夠，如果真係依個議案能夠通過咗、終止到嘅話咧，真係進行頭先我所講嘅嘢，就係真係做一個好詳細同埋深入嘅誒反省同埋檢討嘅。主席本人近於陳詞。楊國橋議員。

701
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:44,540
或者剛才發言嘅梁耀忠議員在內，認為咧支持休會待續，亦都提出咗佢哋非常有力，亦都係能夠咧係顧及人性嘅種種觀點咧，我亦都係絕對嘅理解。只不過咧，公民黨喺今次嘅終止議案待續。

702
02:19:51,620 --> 02:20:11,630
我哋唔想即係一啲當事人咧，喺一個噉樣樣得唔到個合理嘅一個嘅法律援一個嘅支援底下裏邊咧，係得到噉嘅最後嘅情況出嚟。咁所以我真係好期望咧，能夠可以終止咗呢一個嘅嘅誒誒誒議案咧，能夠多啲時間。

703
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:41,630
以致到今次嘅調幅上高，以致到我哋政府整個財政運作上高，係咪真係可以能夠改善一下目前嘅制度，而唔能夠即係好似而家噉樣就噉樣去通過咧？誒，主席，我唔想再花啲時間去誒阻住大家發言，但係不過咧，我真係好期望政府。

704
02:21:06,820 --> 02:21:26,830
即係如歌詞所講，如果你知我苦衷，何以沒一點感動？係咪？即係佢背後希望能夠達到嘅對制度嘅嗰個鞭策，希望能夠咧促使制度帶來真正嘅改革咧。呢一點我係絕對唔會質疑㗎。而對於剛才其他同事，包括陳陳志全議員或，

705
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:08,560
個觀察咧，我就會進入。

706
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:26,010
一年啊，而其實唔止一年，主席係講緊過去嘅一季嘅，其實嚇，本年到二零一七年嘅第三季咧。

707
02:24:57,830 --> 02:25:05,930
誒，我先宣佈一下啦。誒，本人都係一位執業嘅大律師，亦都咧係誒有時候係會從事刑事嘅案件㗎。

708
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:35,710
其實誒獲呢個法官委派嘅大律師嘅數目咧，講緊嘅係差唔多係超過三百位嘅。

709
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:54,790
嘅層誒呢一點而言咧，我哋係恕難同佢哋咧係站在同一陣先。我哋認為咧，今次嘅優會代續咧係唔應該獲得通過嘅。

710
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:25,270
費物價指數作為一個唯一嘅標準咧，我哋係有誒係有保留，亦都希望政府係理解嘅咧，或者明白個問題咧，有以下幾點嘅。

711
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:18,380
繼續討論翻相關嘅議題咧，主席就係睇翻法律援助處外判案件嘅數字咧。我哋會注意到喺過去嘅。

712
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:57,550
市民當然係最終會被受影響啦，而因為律師唔能夠提供一個最佳嘅服務咧，我亦都覺得呢一個咧係對於律師咧係有所誒不公道嘅。嗱，講到呢度咧，主席亦都請容許咧係。

713
02:23:49,340 --> 02:24:03,990
喺二零一六到一七年年度咧，相關數字已經係攀升到五億八千萬嘅啦。咩意思咧？即係話需要相關服務嘅人士咧，係大幅增加，而牽涉嘅案件咧，亦都係非常之多嘅。

714
02:21:55,070 --> 02:22:15,080
當然喺展述點解唔應該獲得通過之前咧，對於即係發回嘅律師係以CPI指數即係誒丙類消費物價指數作為一個座標，我哋都係會抱有極大嘅質疑，亦都咧係提出我哋以下觀點：點解以消

715
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:45,610
包括咧C.P.I嘅問題咧，係忽略品質提升帶來嘅好處。咁呢一個咧係衡量。楊國橋議員，我想提醒你咧，因為依一個咧係終止嘅議案咧，你講個C.P.I嗰度咧，其實喺過去嗰八九個鐘頭已經好多人提咗，就唔應該再去啊。

716
02:22:45,610 --> 02:23:05,620
冗敍噉樣去繼續去講，你只係要講你點解支持或者反對終止個議案咧，係已經足夠嘅。請你繼續。好多謝主席提醒。噉我亦都相信咧，主席會明白我唔係一個好長氣嘅人嚟嘅，即係我簡單咁講一講，對於C P I嘅一。

717
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:28,850
建基於我呢個論點咧，會繼續展述落去嘅，主席嚇噉啊。當然啦，CPI咧亦都未必係只係一點啦，即係計算CPI過於繁複嘅。咁究竟點先係真正嘅公道咧？我相信咧，即係要需要我哋更加多嘅經濟學家啦，去畀一啲建議。只不過咧，即係。

718
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:49,020
講到即係法律援助咧，主席有數字咧，我覺得係值得大家攞出嚟討論㗎。尤其是針對刑事嘅法律援助方面咧，喺二零一五一六年咧，根據政府嘅數字係有四點五億咧，其實係使咗落去支持呢個刑事嘅法律援助。

719
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:24,410
而根據法律援助處嘅統計，喺就咁講緊本年度嘅誒七月到九月嘅相關數字咧，牽涉到相關嘅刑事案件嘅數字咧，就咁而區域法院所批出嘅誒證書，講緊係三百幾宗，咁即係話起碼有用呢個。

720
02:24:24,410 --> 02:24:44,420
概念咧係有三百多嘅人次或者市民咧係受惠嘅嗱，正正因為呢個原因咧，如果我哋冒然噉樣今次將相關嘅議案中止待續嘅話咧，直接影響嘅就係其實係數以百計嘅香港市民同埋佢哋嘅法律代表嗱，點解即係？

721
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:51,690
能夠幫到佢哋㗎。

722
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,590
冇水係點去咧？

723
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:30,370
即係同意喺度，只不過咧。

724
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:39,080
而講緊事務律師咧，就更加多添。

725
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:08,480
就係法律個法字係點寫嘅咧？就係三點水逐個去。

726
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:12,120
正得以彰顯，係咪兩年嘅呢一個檢討，就能夠可以幫助到香港市民？

727
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:47,690
係講緊超過六百名嘅，咁而家如果算就咁一季度啊，主席就已經係有如此龐大嘅數字。

728
02:26:51,990 --> 02:27:03,390
嗱，主席講到呢一度咧，我就想分享一下一個好簡單嘅誒一句説話咧，係我從事法律工作以嚟咧聽到會心微笑，雖然未必完全認同。

729
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:45,550
係為公義，但係同一時間咧，無論係老闆啦、地產商啦、業主啦，佢哋唔係咁諗㗎嘛。咁所以咧，佢哋係需要大量嘅資源咧協助佢哋，得以繼續從事呢個維護公義嘅服務嘅。

730
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:28,360
真正得到最好嘅法律工作同埋法律誒律師嘅協助咧。嗱，主席講到呢一度咧，我又想攞翻剛才法援處提供嘅數字咧，係作一個即係討論嘅。根據法援處嘅數字喺上一季。

731
02:25:47,970 --> 02:26:07,980
當然，我哋今日喺度討論，喺度爭取嘅唔係為講緊呢兩邊加埋差唔多一千位嘅法律工作者，誒，為佢哋嘅一啲個人嘅利益咁簡單，而係我哋相信咧係能夠及時、即時、儘快噉樣去為法律工作者提供一個適切嘅一個公道嘅誒。

732
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:27,990
薪酬調整咧，係能夠令到大家咧係得到一個更加妥善嘅保障嘅啫。嗱，當然啦，對於正如剛才提及，我哋今次反對終止代續嘅議案，唔代表咧，我哋係完全擁抱咧，係以丙類消費物價指數咧作為一個基準。嗱，當然冇呢個。

733
02:26:30,650 --> 02:26:50,660
現時能夠及早噉樣去簡單嚟講加薪咧，其實係一個即時嘅效果，係能夠咧舒緩到而家廣大嘅法律同僚咧，佢哋喺面對住而家香港咁貴百物騰貴嘅前提底下咧，係儘快好似及時雨一樣咧，係能。

734
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:30,880
即係主席，當然公義咧係唔能夠用錢嚟買㗎。咁但係對於大部分以法律為生嘅誒，即係以以打官司、以法律為生嘅法律從業者嚟講咧，其實的確佢哋都係為生嚟啫。好多就算即係一心一意。

735
02:27:45,830 --> 02:28:05,840
所以主席講到呢一度咧，我就希望咧，就係儘管我哋今次係反對呢個終止代續嘅議案，但係我亦都希望咧，政府係能夠考慮咧，係咪只係建基於呢個兩年一度嘅檢討，就能夠滿足到香港嘅法律服務？係咪兩年一度嘅檢討，就能夠令到公義真？

736
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:48,650
喺刑事案件獲委啊，民事同刑事案件加埋啊，係獲委派嘅律師人次咧，年資十年以上嘅喺大律師嚟講咧係二百七十位，喺律師數目嚟講年資十年以上咧五百七十六位。嗱，剛才我提過啦，呢個數字咧係差唔多加埋過千嘅。

737
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:10,220
主席。

738
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:24,600
多謝主席。

739
02:45:21,410 --> 02:45:22,650
陳述莊嚴。

740
02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:37,940
啊，主席，即係我就唔係一個好長氣嘅人嚟㗎。正如我剛才開首所講，咁所以咧，主席。

741
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:48,860
本人咧發言咧就差唔多嚟到呢一度啦。咁喺發言結束之前咧，我就注意到可能有部分嘅同事不在席，咁所以希望咧主席可以點算發言人數嘅。

742
02:28:48,650 --> 02:29:08,660
而呢兩組數字咧合拼起嚟咧，講緊就已經係差唔多係超越八百名。咩意思咧？即係話非常資深十年以上嘅咧，係佔咗大部分嘅。但係我哋睇一睇年資喺十年以下嘅咧，其實相加起嚟啊，因為法援處咧就係三年以下三至五。

743
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:28,670
或者六至十年，如果將呢三組數字加埋起嚟嘅話咧，主席其實只不過係佔冰山嘅一角，九牛一毛。點解咧？即係呢個數字反映嘅，當然就係越資深嘅係能夠得到獲委派嘅機會。故之然，對於客户嚟講係好啦，因為佢哋有一個有經。

744
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:48,680
經驗嘅人協助佢哋，但係同一時間咧，就係亦都有可能係對於吸引新人入行，對於令到有資歷有能力嘅新人進快入行去填補翻將來出現嘅空缺咧。呢一點我係帶有憂慮嘅。主席噉，所以點解咧？希望即係透過今次我哋反對終止代罪嘅。

745
02:29:48,680 --> 02:30:08,690
意外嘅同時咧，亦都希望相關政府嘅官員咧能夠反省下、檢討下，亦都咧係為將來咧係作未雨綢繆，等盡快係可以咧係吸引更加多嘅人入行，更加多嘅人有能力咧去參與法律援助嘅服務，以其咧係可以協助到香港更加多有需要嘅市民嘅。

746
02:30:10,510 --> 02:30:30,520
即係講咗咁耐咧，我即係希望特別咧係強調一點，就係現時某某言終止代續咧，唔單止未必能夠即時啟動到，令到政府重新檢討相關嘅制度，因為政府做嘢咧一向都唔係以光速見稱嘅。但係同一時間咧，直接打擊。

747
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:50,530
直接影響嘅咧，就係無論係律師好定係市民好，咁呢一個咧牽涉到廣大嘅香港人咧，我就覺得喺今次而言咧，我哋係希望能夠説服到大家係能夠放政府一馬，亦都畀政府盡快通過相關嘅加薪之後咧，即係調整呢個薪酬之後咧，係能夠盡。

748
02:30:50,530 --> 02:31:10,540
快咧，係作一個深切嘅檢討。噉我就唔知道咧，建制派嘅議員，包括有法律背景嘅咧，認唔認同我呢個講法？我哋都借呢個機會咧，鼓勵佢哋應該咧係就相關業界也好，或者個人經驗也好咧，係分享一下大家嘅睇法啦、經驗啦，亦都咧可以令到我哋今次呢啲討論咧唔好太單向嘅。主席，噉我亦都。

749
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:30,550
相信咧，即係有法律背景嘅建制派同僚咧，喺今次呢一個唔係咁政治化嘅議題上面咧，應該係有好多嘅説話咧，可以同大家分享嘅。咁所以我希望咧，即係主席能夠咧鼓勵佢哋係一陣有機會喺今次呢個人才仔仔嘅情況底下攞出嚟討論一下大家嘅睇法。
