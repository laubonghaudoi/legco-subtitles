1
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,230
啊。

2
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,990
做緊新業。

3
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,350
反對嘅請舉手。

4
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,940
主席就誒。

5
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,620
誒唔係一個好嘅平衡嚟嘅。

6
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,610
議案獲得通過。

7
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,760
樹柏有委員想發言。

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,320
第八條及附表。律政司司長。

9
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,590
誒，所謂同道歉有關嘅。

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,860
第一至七及九至十三條，是否有委員想發言？

11
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,060
陳述嘅事實係絕對豁免嘅話咧，我覺得咧係一個。

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,860
現在嘅代決議題係秘書處讀出嘅條文納入本條例草案，贊成嘅請舉手。

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:47,390
我認為議題係獲得在席委員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,770
我琴日誒都喺嗰個議讀嘅時候嗰個發言咧，就誒我表達咗咧，其實咧，如果誒喺一個

15
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:23,250
盜協條例草案。本會現在成為全體委員會，就條例草案嘅辯論同埋表決嘅安排，委員可參與講稿附錄。我會先處理冇修正嘅條文。現在嘅待議題係以下條文納入《盜協條例草案》。

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:12,620
主席，我 moved the amendments to the clause and the schedule read out just now. The amendments to the clause and the schedule are set out in the paper distributed to members. I've already explained the purposes of the amendments earlier today. The Bills Committee has discussed and expressed support for the above amendments. I urge members to pass these.

17
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,080
呈堂。

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,800
啊！

19
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,440
嘅證據。

20
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,110
噉啊，可以咧就。

21
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,520
就都可以呈堂嘅話。

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,900
將嗰啲事實咧，就係誒。

23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,150
咁咧就可以係作出一個誒，即係全面噉樣。

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,430
主席，但係誒，經過我哋委員會裏邊嘅討論咧，我就覺得。

25
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,050
如果真係誒係，當然我我知道有啲同事，我應該咁講嘅。有啲同事咧就覺得。

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,750
當講嗰啲陳述誒道歉嘅過程裏邊嘅事實係太容易咧，就同以前冇呢個法例一樣。

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:29,860
噉就或者甚至當做一個承認責任嘅話，噉啊即係究竟有咩用咧？噉啊，我我知道有啲同事咧係確係有啲噉嘅誒睇法嘅。

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:26,030
而嗰啲事實咧，就係同嗰個案情，即係嘅能夠誒往後，譬如話民事訴訟裏邊咧，係能夠倚賴嘅唯一。

29
00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:02,230
咁誒原本喺嗰個誒法例裏邊嘅草案咧，佢就誒政府咧就都覺得誒可能有一啲嘅極端嘅情況。

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:14,880
就誒，所以咧，佢就用咗一個概念咧，就係所謂誒唯一證據，即係話，如果嗰個對方誒道歉，但係佢又講咗啲陳述咗啲事實。

31
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:08,410
誒，如果你有一個誒道歉嘅法例，就係希望鼓勵人哋道歉啦，或者咁講嚇，而道歉嘅目目的就係鼓勵誒化解一啲恩怨啊，或者和解啊噉樣。咁如果咧就係誒嗰個。

32
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:50,260
咁但係誒，我覺得所有嘢咧都要有一個平衡啦，因為咧，如果係噉嘅話咧，就會誒佢造成嘅後果。我琴日喺二讀嗰個時候咧都講過，就誒誒冇嘅，因為所有嘢都豁免，所有都係唔能夠呈堂。咁最後咧係有一個可能性咧。

33
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,690
佢犯錯嘅。

34
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,360
即係另一啲。

35
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,940
充分掌握所有嘢之後。

36
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,110
咁但係我都明白咧，有啲情況咧，就係佢係。

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,200
就所謂咧誒會誒不公嘅情況。

38
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,800
舒舒咗誒，即係舒舒緩咗佢嗰個情緒。

39
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,550
我覺得喺香港嘅情況之下咧，都係真係會。

40
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,520
甚至咧，就係根本就係已經接受咗啦，就唔追究啦噉。

41
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,930
快啲搞掂件事都得嘅嚇，所以佢可能好有誠意嘅啊。如果目的咧，都可以係咧係誒。

42
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:22,200
噉佢哋話：個撞做咩咧？就係愛嚟，誒令到嗰個受害人或者佢嘅家屬啦，就係覺得。

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,520
咁不公係源於好多種可能性啦，咁其中一種就係我琴日講就係話會有機會咧，就係誒因為。

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,170
犯錯人咧係誒過分道歉，甚至佢道埋嗰啲嘢咧都誒多遠遠多過個事實。

45
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:29,070
有一個可能性咧，就係因為一啲過分嘅道歉，或者係誒，我唔好話有冇誠意先啦嚇，可能佢佢個誠意係來自咧，佢想。

46
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:51,480
嘅事實，甚至責任，甚至係法律嘅後果，而係決定咧唔追究有嘅呢個啊噉，甚至極端嘅例子。

47
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:51,210
多元化嘅啊，好複雜嘅啊，唔係一個簡單嘅目的，或想咧就係誒害對方，或者甚至咧想對方咧就完全唔追究，就自己咧就唔使賠啊，或者唔使承擔責任，即係未必一定係噉嘅。O.K.，但係咧，往往咧。

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:14,650
唔係完全一樣啦嚇，嗰啲誒受害嘅家屬，譬如個仔畀人殺死咗啦嚇，嗰個當日係刑事啦嚇，佢甚至咧幫嗰個殺害者求情嘅啊，都有嘅啊，咁即係所以咧係好複雜嘅，但係個問題咧就係喺我嘅誒接觸或者。

49
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,610
舒緩咗。

50
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,540
咁因此咧。

51
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,090
啊！噉。

52
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
甚至佢咧嗰個誒。

53
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,360
或者甚，佢可能要求賠償。

54
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,200
第一個階段，佢因為係。

55
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,060
即係個受害者或者個家屬唔相信。

56
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,140
即係第第一階段嗰個道歉咧，係來自。

57
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,940
個受害者，佢嗰秒鐘咧，可能咧，佢係。

58
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,640
或者甚至咧，就係誒，佢覺得嗰個道歉。

59
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,930
唔係來自犯錯者嘅，啊！即係我舉例，譬如有時。

60
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:17,480
誒個院長、副院長或者個主管，但係就未必可能係做手術嗰個醫生。OK，咁往往咧就係喺第二個階段。

61
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:23,260
誒個情緒波動，但係佢已經過氣咗啦。佢已經咧沉澱咗，佢係有能力，亦都有決心，亦都好想。

62
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:33,810
舉個例，尋求一啲全面嘅事實。如果事實咧都未必係嗰個道歉者咧誒所陳述嘅嗰一套，甚至佢哋都唔相信。

63
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:07,620
但係咧，佢一段時間之後，甚至佢係比較掌握更多嘅誒法律嘅分析，更多掌握誒一啲嘅誒支援。

64
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:08,710
你醫院即係我，如果啲個案制嗰個誒，就算而家法例未通過，同你所謂道歉或者即係唔好意思啊、誒sorry啊等等啲嘢咧，嗰個係來自。

65
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,680
啊。

66
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,700
有可能咧。

67
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,900
誒。

68
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,870
當時道歉。

69
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,700
受害者或者家屬咧。

70
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,660
嗰個。

71
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,100
嗱，呢個咧真係係，所以好複雜嘅。

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,680
噉我覺得咧就會誒。

73
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,430
嗰個真係犯錯嗰個人咧，嚟到親自道歉。

74
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,360
咁但係，如果你到嗰陣時先至發覺，誒原來。

75
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,990
嘅嘢咧，嗰個事實咧嘅陳述咧，係唔能夠呈堂。

76
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:28,390
或者甚至咧，喺一啲好重大嘅不公義裏邊，都唔能夠去呈堂。

77
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,000
佢所希望得到嘅咧，或者佢透過文字嘅訴眾，或者透過其他嘅。

78
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,660
紀律聆訊，或者所謂一啲嘅誒其他誒嘅法定機構調查，或者其他嘅。

79
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:02,330
可能係民事嘅庭，可能係誒喺嗰個誒另一波嘅賠償討論裏邊嘅作為一點嘅條件，就係由。

80
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:51,820
咪可能立法會調查得㗎嚇，咁如果有啲case，而跟進翻嗰啲事實嘅時候咧，佢可能只想知道真相之餘咧，亦都可能咧希望喺嗰啲場合。

81
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,710
或者。

82
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,380
第二咧就係。

83
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,300
我哋社會進步。

84
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,270
係向前行咗一步。

85
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,860
第一，對嗰個受害者咧，其實係有不公。

86
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,030
係受壓而得到改善。

87
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,470
防止其他人會受害咧，係最好嘅。

88
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,480
誒，當然我我咁諗啦嚇，誒。

89
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,550
但係個明白個情況就係咧，如果你失去一個平衡咧，係好危險嘅。

90
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:02,400
佢嘅披露、公開，甚至令到政府或者嗰個制度。

91
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:55,140
有時我哋亦都唔好睇輕咧，有一啲訴訟，或者甚至有啲好獨特嘅事實組合嘅訴訟。

92
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,360
咁當然，我我唔係懷疑政府咧，就推動呢個勞業法嗰個目目背後目目啊動機係不良，我完全唔係嘅。

93
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,820
我並唔係懷疑政府今次推動話道歉法，即係佢都係參考全世界好多嘅一啲嘅誒相類似嘅情況。

94
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:17,800
噉，所以我哋有時咧，即係樣樣都話咧，所有嘢都conciliation，所有都係誒和解，所有都係咧。有時我哋真係係好小心咧。

95
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:47,650
我琴日都講啦，可能好多同事少留意嘅就係咧，有時我哋當大力推動和解、化解冤仇，所謂將啲嘢壓咗落去嘅時候咧。

96
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:46,210
亦都過分去著重咗話和解就是至高無上，最好所有案都和解得到咧。呢個並非係對。

97
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,580
咁但係咧。

98
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,640
有時我咁諗。

99
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,280
其實咪出嚟道歉咯。

100
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,860
如果個已經係，

101
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,000
佢可以係一個受益者。

102
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,670
咁但係，畢竟咧就係。

103
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,340
亦都可以係受害者，有人咁講。

104
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,890
能夠比較放膽一啲去。

105
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,020
但係，政府亦都你可以咁講。

106
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,650
其實嗰種過分謹慎嘅態度咧，其實係令到人咧好反感。

107
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,460
多過一半，或者誒誒誒有信心，有相當嘅信心，咪只做錯嘅。

108
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,310
就算你話喂咁咁會會唔會我哋咪要賠好多錢噉樣當咗認認認錯咁？

109
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:34,440
呢個咧當然未必係最好嘅，但係當我哋兩者取其輕嘅時候咧，有時如果政府就算未有道歉法之前咧，

110
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:14,520
咁但係大家都明白咧，如果我就咁講咧，推動逃税法嘅咧，好多國家咧，佢都係由政府去推動，佢可能咧揾一個法律改革委員會，即係類似我哋噉樣。

111
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:42,520
如果政府係根根本佢嘅人力、物力、財政係比起其他嘅個別嘅犯錯人咧係大好多嘅時候咧，有時我覺得佢哋比較，就算冇呢個道歉法之前。

112
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:24,400
因為政府相對嚟講，佢嗰個所謂叫誒，如果去法庭去辯護，話自己究竟當時嘅道歉係唔係等於全面承認責任啊？誒，或者咧係甚至啊，最極端，如果真係有啲案佢係道錯咗歉，承認咗個責任，但係你記住。

113
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,300
其實以後咧。

114
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,310
究竟一個犯錯人同你道歉？

115
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,550
喂，直情係唔唔肯道歉嘅。

116
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
噉我自己都喺度平衡過。

117
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,210
朱席好啦，而家講翻而家個嗰個修訂咧。

118
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,660
就我覺得咧係誒較好嘅平衡。

119
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,220
其實你喺呢個法律通過之後咧，即係有建及呢個平衡啊！

120
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,540
雖然咧，我覺得都唔係最好嘅平衡，不過我哋都知道咧。

121
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,360
我就要，亦都話畀其他嘅市民知道。

122
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,580
啊！你你你諗下之前嗰個海難事件，我哋嗰啲官員出嚟。

123
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:14,380
但係有一點咧，我亦都趁住呢個噉樣嘅formula，即係噉嘅誒方程式之下咧。

124
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:55,600
啊！元水就話咧，官員咧就不能犯錯，不能誒誒個別誒歸咎任何嘅人。

125
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:06,750
啊，然後咧就誒誒誒，即係即係嗰個態度咧係，咁當然我唔知個態度係咪完全係同要賠償有關啦嚇，但係咧。

126
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:08,330
就我覺得暫時喺呢個情況之下咧，我覺得係誒誒勉強可以接受嘅一個平衡，同埋係誒喺三讀二讀我都係會投贊成票。

127
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:52,760
誒，如果我再推動多一啲，能夠有啲豁免嘅話咧，我相信咧，可能咧就呢個法例過唔到，啊或者咧根本就冇人理我，啊，即係可能我啲噉嘅道理咧，亦都唔會得到誒接納。

128
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:23,850
有啲我哋事後知道嘅案件咧，其實點解政府尤其是嗰啲官員，譬如退咗休啊噉樣，佢佢都話：，唉，嗰陣時咧，即係誒，因為咧律政司或者點樣叫我哋，喂，千祈唔好道歉啊，唔掂㗎噉樣啊噉。咁所以咧就係係係有啲噉嘅顧慮。

129
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,280
但係咧。

130
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,540
當睇。

131
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,950
包括政府。

132
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,980
其實個趨勢咧。

133
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,810
一個犯錯者去道歉。

134
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,590
真係會道歉多咗。

135
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,240
我覺得咧，係大家真係要小心。

136
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,360
不過，因為道歉法通過。

137
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,520
之下嘅道歉多咗，想食。

138
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,210
自我已經完完成咗嗰個心理嘅治療，等等咧。

139
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,980
即係話，以後做受害者嘅咧，或者佢嘅家屬，或者佢嘅朋友。

140
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,560
包括可能醫院，包括撞撞車嘅撞親你嘅人，或者其他嘅機構啊。

141
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,300
究竟係咪真誠嘅道歉多咗，一係假意嘅道歉多咗，或者係係複雜嘅目的？

142
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:32,880
完結嘅案件，或者甚至咧，如果嗰個家屬咧誒鋸曬所謂，就唔會尋求訴訟，或者係誒追究更多嘅真相。

143
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:45,230
唔好意思啊，主席，我我我唔係話嗰個受害人咧，一定要用一個好懷疑嘅眼光，就係話嗰個道歉者係咪有誠意道歉，係咪真係道歉咧？有誠意嘅咧，我並唔係一定要你永遠都懷疑佢。

144
00:13:49,480 --> 00:14:04,910
我我已經開始同一啲誒朋友傾開，即係會處理啲糾紛嘅人啦，包括律師啊、誒調解者啊、誒甚至係誒會比較多畀人告有機會嘅一啲嘅機構啊嘅處理嘅人都好。

145
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,280
因為點解咧？

146
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,840
而政府咧？

147
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,040
我會睇就係。

148
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,630
如果佢嗰個道歉，

149
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,980
我覺得嗰樣嘢咧，本身咧。

150
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,710
佢或者其他機構咧？

151
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,960
係顯示嘅誠意係更多。

152
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,590
值得接受同原諒嘅。

153
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,010
O.K.啊，公立醫院都一樣，私家醫院都可能係。O.K.

154
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,830
咁老實講咧，嗰個係較有誠意嘅道歉。

155
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,360
誒，即係學誒誒程度咧，我覺得係更加大。

156
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,690
點解咧？因為佢講咗啲事實，就算佢係用呢個豁免咗嘅話咧。

157
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,270
係比較多係講個事實，我做錯啲乜嘢嘅咧？

158
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:44,460
如果佢係越承認喺具體嘅事實裏邊係有乜嘢犯錯？

159
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:30,230
嗱，我噉樣講嘅意思即係話咧，因為有啲專業道歉者，將來會有專業道歉者嘅啊。其實個副可能可能將來啲醫院咧，個副院長括弧行政就專責道歉都得。

160
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:17,000
表面上佢變咗，但係你知道嘅事實咧，你憑住呢啲事實背後嘅原始文件咧，係可以喺法庭裏邊得到多啲嘅追究嘅機會。如果要追究嘅話，但係原諒，你都可以原諒佢。

161
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,600
量計創業。

162
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,060
會鼓勵。

163
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,440
excluding Scotland。

164
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,120
for a number of reasons. First,

165
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,120
people to get on the habit of apologising.

166
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:09,690
但喺《蘇格蘭立法》中，Mr. President，有個絕對排除，任何事實陳述喺道歉中。

167
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:26,360
但係，如果啲係猛同你講道歉，但係任何嘅事實，邊一樣具體事實犯錯都唔講嘅咧，主席，我請市民以後留意。

168
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:34,710
now whether the total exclusion or the inclusion or partial exclusion of such evidence

169
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:53,920
或whether there will be other you know negative benefit negative factor which will be generated from these options, we don't know, because in any event.

170
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:06,600
looking at the various jurisdictions which have enacted apology bill, it is quite a new piece of legislation. What benefit or disadvantage we chose from the various options?

171
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:41,970
If we look at the jurisdictions which has enacted apology bill, there is no trend we can follow because, for example, in the United Kingdom.

172
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:23,860
meaning that it is quite clear and precise that anything, anybody mentioned in an apology, will be excluded from being admitted as evidence in any proceedings.

173
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:44,230
Thank you, Mr. President. In this speech, I would like to concentrate my discussion on the amendment appertaining to Section 8, Subsection 2 of the Bill.

174
00:17:45,010 --> 00:18:00,240
The evidence or or the fact you know stated in an apology, will will not benefit from any exclusion at all. It's not mentioned, merely not mentioned in in the UK legislation.

175
00:16:44,550 --> 00:17:04,560
Now, in fact, I've in my first speech briefly discussed the social benefits of the apology bill as a whole, and in his speech just made by the secretary for justice, of course, we've also seen some of the other benefits for.

176
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:24,570
enhancing Hong Kong as an arbitration and mediation centre with the passage of the bill. In the committee, bills committee discussion, we spent quite a lot of time discuss discussing section eight, and it is quite an important section.

177
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,490
precedence。

178
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,340
for exceptional circumstances.

179
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,370
另一個 concern。

180
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,410
available for determining an issue.

181
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,070
And we have to get more.

182
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,520
Under certain conditions, under this subsection.

183
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,500
The three options we do not know, so we have to experiment.

184
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,750
benefit the user of this piece of legislation because it provides more certainty.

185
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,710
The law is new. We have to experiment. We have to experience how this piece of legislation is being administered.

186
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:21,450
Now, however, from the Constitution of Subsection 8, Subsection 2, there are a number of questions we have raised.

187
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:40,800
whole exhaustive list of exceptional circumstances, so I have to accept that the draft it is because, as I have mentioned.

188
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:08,750
expressed by my colleagues in the committee stage would be the definition of decision maker, because the decision maker will have a discretion to admit a statement of fact.

189
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:28,020
The decision maker, as defined in this bill, means, in relation to an applicable proceedings, the person, in bracket, whether a court, a tribunal, an arbitrator or any other body or individual.

190
00:19:44,080 --> 00:20:01,460
now I've spent quite a lot of time discussing with the administration why you have to define exceptional case by just citing an example. I was requesting an exhaustive list of these exceptional circumstances because it would

191
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:40,340
first of all, in in the way section subsection two is drafted, it started with however, if in particular applicable proceedings there is an exceptional case, and then is said in bracket for example where there is no other evidence.

192
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:30,600
And after much grilling and discussion, and I finally convinced, I've been convinced that yes, if there's no other available evidence, could be just one of the many, you know, exceptional circumstances. But it would be impossible for the administration to give the

193
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,960
嗯。

194
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
and.

195
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,120
render this discretion a rather

196
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,100
you know real discretion exercised by somebody with no legal training.

197
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,920
行政已經把兩項修正案在不同的階段通過，我認為第一。

198
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,120
但係，我認為，如果我們看下適用程序的定義，在第六節。

199
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:23,250
And if we look at all these proceedings under the present body of law, I would.

200
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Piece of amendment was given to us on the eighth of June for the committee to study.

201
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,600
我認為much of these concern should be you know dealt with，因為under section six。

202
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:47,170
Section eight, subsection two, as we trot along, because we have no experience in administering this legislation.

203
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,390
looking at the amendments proposed by the administration, in fact, the administration quite

204
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:16,070
The definition of applicable proceeding actually means any judicial, arbitral, administrative, disciplinary and regulatory proceedings.

205
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:43,240
many of my colleagues expressed a grave concern about whether any other body or individual would include anyone with no legal training at all, and which would.

206
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:38,830
be rather surprised to find any tribunal or judicial bodies or disciplinary panels being comprised of people zero or no legal training at all. But as I've said, we have to adjust.

207
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:48,660
Now many will be concerned to give an apology because under some circumstances, under some exceptional circumstances, the evidence or the fact contained in apology will be given will be admissible as evidence.

208
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:32,280
And after much discussion, there was a final version which the administration has put through on the 15th of June. Of course, I mean what we are discussing now is the version, the final version suggested to us on the 15th of June.

209
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,670
Wait.

210
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,660
但。

211
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,680
and.

212
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,350
Give an example.

213
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,130
interest of the administration of justice.

214
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:16,750
但，whether the factual circumstances of the apology would need to be a full

215
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:24,750
factual description is up to the person offering the apology to give. Of course, I mean.

216
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:36,300
The person giving the apology may have to consult his legal adviser. It may be just a very brief description of fact or a general description of fact. That is the first layer protection.

217
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:29,910
Repeatedly defined in our common law precedents, so I'm quite happy that what constitutes just and equitable is quite precise and consistently applied.

218
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:09,370
所以， not just having satisfied just an equitable requirement， the decision maker also has to take into account the public interest or the interest of the administration of justice.

219
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:18,070
And there is also a third layer protection, because in order for a decision maker to exercise a discretion, he has to satisfy that it is just and equitable to do so, and just and equitable is a term.

220
00:23:50,240 --> 00:24:10,250
my personal opinion is this is the exception, the rather exception rather than a rule, basically because of many reasons. First of all, there is no prescribed form of apology. Of course, apology will contain an apology. I'm sorry. I I'm really regretted to to to learn that.

221
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:57,250
And the second layer of protection is, of course, there must be an exceptional circumstances, exceptional case. But unfortunately, the administration is unable to provide us with a very detailed exhaustive list of exceptional case. Apart from the fact that when there is no other evidence available, as a

222
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:52,380
The other criteria, the third you know hurdle which the decision maker has to comply with in order to give discretion is that the decision maker have to take into account or having regard to the public interest or the.

223
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:30,080
But of course, some of my colleagues may have some queries about the usage of the language. Having regard, it is not quite a you know term which urge you know an obligation to do so. This maybe the honourable professor Yu may have some thought about this. But after taking into account.

224
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:50,090
Many other legislation having this type of language having regard to, I'm quite satisfied that the present committee stage amendments with section two of these amendments have strike a subtle balance. But of course, whether this balance will work in actual fact, and we have to

225
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,340
國家奇緣。

226
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,820
Thank you, Mr. President.

227
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,620
道歉法嘅成立咧，誒。

228
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,010
the committee or the panel of this.

229
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,150
主席，就我發言係有關於第八條嘅修訂嘅。

230
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,320
整體嚟講咧，我相信作為醫生或者大部分嘅醫務工作人員咧，對於

231
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:32,060
都係表示歡迎同埋正面嘅喺調解督導委員會入邊咧，其實五個成員入邊兩位係醫生。

232
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:04,230
legislature should not be included in the apology bill because we are an independent lawmaking body and should stay as such.

233
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:19,920
我 offer an apology, and of course the other reason why we need this approach is that

234
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:09,990
Article 14 of the ICCPR is entrenched by Article 39 of the Basic Law.

235
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:41,770
咁呢個一個好嘅例子咧，係證明咗咧，其實道歉法作為對於好多嘅誒。

236
00:26:50,950 --> 00:27:10,960
But I think for the sake of developing common law and Hong Kong is a very important common law jurisdiction. I will support the CSA and the third reading of the bill because without such piece of legislation, people will be quite reluctant to.

237
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:40,570
If all these apology, all these factual description in apology were excluded from being admitted as evidence, there is a concern expressed by the administration, and I agree with this concern. Is that

238
00:27:40,880 --> 00:28:00,890
Such will probably such drafting or such provision may properly infringe Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, and this Article 10, of course, corresponds with Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and of course.

239
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:30,690
So, for the above reasons, Mr. President, I support this committee stage amendment to section 2, subsection 8 of section 2. And the other amendment, of course, in this CSA is about the amendment to the schedule. Now, the schedule of this bill merely sets out certain

240
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,960
道歉。

241
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,790
唔同嘅公職人員。

242
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,590
雙方嘅司機。

243
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,760
當然包括醫生咧，喺佢每日面對。

244
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,030
從來都唔係一件容易嘅事。

245
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,950
呢啲好多嘅例子咧，都令到咧。

246
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,970
落咗車之後咧，都係不發一言。

247
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,590
正如喺諮詢文件入邊講得好清楚。

248
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,390
都係一個重要嘅一個法律。

249
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,500
咁所以咧，就有一個道歉法咧，就係係好事嚟嘅。

250
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:16,710
個原因咧，就係喺好多情況底下咧，道歉被視為承認過失、承認責任。

251
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,930
大家都試過有機會咧，係有啲輕微嘅交通事故。通常一落車咧，以我自己為例咧，就話叫警察。

252
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:50,660
因為一講咗出嚟咧，就大家都認為對方咧就承認咗個責任，而最終咧可能又被起訴。

253
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:02,260
誒道歉成為一件最難嘅個事情，歌都有一唱嚇，Sorry seems to be the hardest word。

254
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:56,290
好多，無論大大小小嘅事故、醫療事故又好，病人嘅不滿又好，情緒又好，等等。

255
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:29,410
所以喺好多嘅場合入邊，譬如一啲病人嘅不幸嘅身故、手術不能成功完成、有併發症，又或者喺交通意外入邊。

256
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:50,700
Certain proceedings where this apology bill will not be applicable, and after some studies by the administration on the parliamentary practices and rules of the various parliaments and various jurisdictions, I agree that the proceedings of

257
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,870
唔收貨。

258
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,440
嗯。

259
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,050
不約而同咧。

260
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,130
兩件事咧。

261
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,160
但係，其實我想講咧，其實。

262
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,910
誒影響。

263
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,920
對方道歉嘅人。

264
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,700
而個道歉咧係不受。

265
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,180
我舉兩個例子，或者大家可以明白。

266
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,070
負責嘅醫院嘅管理層咧，都出嚟做咗道歉。

267
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,120
但係今次嗰個修正案第八條咧，就正正咧係爭議所在。

268
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:30,230
誒嗰個疑點或者個利益咧，就會畀曬嗰個向。

269
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,510
都係有病人因為誒藥物嘅處方咧，引起一個嚴大嚴重嘅。

270
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:12,320
噉我唔唔能夠去喺呢件事入邊再講得多啲啦，因為主席呢個一個好複雜嘅事情。但係如果大家有留意嘅話咧，就

271
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:23,050
頭先我都細心聽咗誒，我哋嘅同事啊，陶錦新議員都講咗咧，佢話如果冇呢一個第八條嘅修正嘅話咧，其實，

272
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:50,390
最近咧就有一啲大家好注目嘅醫療事故嘅，包括係聯合醫院嘅事故，同埋喺啱啱昨日發生嘅瑪麗醫院嘅事故。

273
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,560
但係，佢其實。

274
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,240
少到一個病人。

275
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,010
三日退唔到燒。

276
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,250
一個醫院嘅情景入邊。

277
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,600
喺一個個案入邊，鄧女士嘅女咧。

278
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,130
呢一啲都係唔同嘅道歉嘅情景。

279
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,790
噉我諗呢個都係個事實嚟嘅，因為其實你試想下喺。

280
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,450
第一個屋企人嘅要求都係一聲嘅道歉，呢個係最起碼。

281
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:42,290
呢個道歉係喺一而再、再而三咧，係冇畀到一個真相嘅時候咧，講出嚟。

282
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,200
佢已經清楚講明，佢唔會接受醫院行政人員嘅道歉，因為呢個唔係一個真誠嘅道歉。

283
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:28,020
嗰個病人就大興嘅家長大興問罪之師就話：，喂，點解你退唔到燒啊？個小朋友好辛苦喎噉。

284
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,980
噉我亦都有留意到咧，就係阿姚崇炎教授咧都引咗三篇嘅文章，係有關於係美國嘅一個嗯。

285
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:51,060
去到大到有一啲嚴重嘅醫療事故，好似聯合醫院嘅鄧貴思女士，中間個差異係由細去到大，大到不得了。

286
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:07,850
學術文件就話喺誒成即係成立咗，或者喺好多州份入邊有咗道歉法咧，個醫療嘅事故咧，或者個賠償係冇少到。

287
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:40,230
又或者打鹽水打錯咗，吉一針嘅吉咗五針，大汗啦。可能嗰個小朋友喺之前咧已經打咗好多人鹽水，根本冇可能再揾到一條啱嘅靜脈。

288
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:15,680
原本冇呢條法例嘅時候咧，我可以講咧，大部分喺醫院工作嘅醫護人員，無論醫生、護士或者治療師之類咧，佢哋都好小心，因為喺醫管局入邊嘅教訓咧，就係話你唔可以輕易咧承認個責任。

289
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,780
入嚟嘅病人。

290
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,380
都係用。

291
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,090
佢哋冇得控制。

292
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,230
但係，大家要明白。

293
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,630
喺醫院前線工作嘅醫生咧。

294
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,610
啊！即係同時醒定啲啊！

295
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,730
無論有幾多時間，都要啃曬嗰啲證。

296
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,250
好少嘅時間，極速完成一個個案。

297
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,870
因為好多情況下冇得折醜嘅，你點折咧？

298
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,040
舉個例，鄧桂思女士之後嘅問題就係原來長期。

299
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,350
所以喺佢哋嗰個情況底下咧，佢哋係頂硬上揀嚟。

300
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:43,360
睇得都要睇，噉佢有冇選擇咧？其實佢冇選擇嘅，嚟幾多睇幾多，啃幾多。

301
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:04,470
因為醫療嘅資源係得咁多，年年嘅錢都唔夠，人手唔夠，資源唔夠，乜嘢都唔夠。

302
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:24,970
呢個係即係不成文嘅，但係我諗大家都知嘅，因為當你承認嗰個責任之後咧，就個後果係相當之大嘅。

303
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:33,580
嗰啲復診嘅病人，佢情況有變，又或者你嘅主管同你講上邊捉緊我哋個輪候時間又多咗一個月，你翻。

304
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:42,160
點解呢個法例好多人都認為咧唔誒係有好多嘅問題而有第八條咧？其實好多嘅醫療事故去到最前咧，當然係一啲即係失誤啦。但係我哋有冇諗深究入邊嘅問題咧？

305
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,540
頭昏腦脹。

306
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,050
好多壓力底下咧～

307
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,410
一路不斷去啃。

308
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,290
咁呢個係咪佢可以控制到咧？

309
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,530
總之，睇到幾多得幾多。

310
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,860
其實唔係嗰啲醫生嘅選擇。

311
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,280
可以睇幾多證？梗係冇啦。

312
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,040
噉你冇得去選擇，你唯有就係。

313
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,720
在隔離嘅成班姑娘望住你。

314
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,150
但佢係要用呢一個方法去生存。

315
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,730
因為冇得選擇㗎嘛，有冇得選擇病人嘅多少，有冇選擇？

316
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,670
作為最前線嘅醫生，佢根本冇冇得控制，佢冇根本冇可能去決定。

317
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:06,880
有幾多個病人？一一個鐘頭睇新證，半個鐘頭睇舊證。如果係嘅話咧，個輪候時間咧就唔係而家三年啦，可能係十年、三十年。

318
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:42,730
一沓沓嘅排版嘅時候，上邊仲有啲病人要見家長，要巡房，跟住仲有幾個程序要做，可能要做嗰啲抽個腎組織檢查，等緊。

319
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:57,290
所以最初寫喺其實我想話畀大家聽，寫喺咧我哋嘅誒有一啲嘅指引入邊講咧，其實最少一個病人新正睇一個鐘頭，夠剩半個鐘頭，你行去醫院睇下。

320
00:36:52,150 --> 00:37:07,180
醫生就話可以過時啫，護士唔得嘅，因為佢哋係定咗個工作時間。佢哋可以有補時，但係一般咧，護士都會希望咧，醫生係依時完成佢個診證，大家有得收工。

321
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,250
個責任。

322
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,170
因為佢得七分鐘睇我。

323
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,920
冇人會識得揾。

324
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,480
而家過咗身啦，一定係關佢事。

325
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,700
喺呢啲好多嘅情況底下。

326
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,590
啃曬佢，所有責任都要啃。

327
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,730
佢搞成我咁嚇，我老媽子。

328
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,360
咁結果咧，去到有醫療事故嘅時候咧。

329
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,570
個生存就係話喺你嘅能力範圍入邊做曬你要做嘅嘢。

330
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,870
咁令到佢哋企喺最前嗰度，入入邊冇嘢可以做。

331
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,880
就係成個制度，成個公共服務嘅資源唔夠。

332
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:19,740
又應該邊個係負咧？所以某程度上，我覺得好第八條過咗去。

333
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,220
醫院嘅院長高高在上，冇人識。不過咧，睇我嗰個醫生咧，佢正衰人嚟嘅。

334
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,990
衞生福利局局長去投訴㗎，冇咁叻㗎嚇，亦都唔識去揾醫管嗰個總總裁阿梁柏賢㗎，唔知咩人嚟嘅。

335
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:30,120
咁將來死因裁判條例入邊可以引用第八條，民事訴訟賠償可以引用第八條，的出罪魁禍首。

336
00:37:51,930 --> 00:38:09,070
我叫佢，我三點鐘求救啊！佢五點鐘先嚟睇我。佢中間嗰兩頭做嗰兩個鐘頭做咩？有冇人去睇？原來佢喺度搶救第二個病人，做緊手術，睇緊門診，冇人理嘅。個個就話：我三點叫佢，佢五點先嚟。佢遲咗兩個鐘，佢死啦噉。

337
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,850
冇人會可憐。

338
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,900
連道歉都唔敢講。

339
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,320
全部都係前線。

340
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,820
你道歉之前有冇問過我？

341
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,100
咁所以咧，以往佢哋。

342
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,120
因為講完之後咧，分分鐘老細都會捽佢。

343
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,760
或者嗰間醫院出嚟頂曬佢。

344
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,720
嗰啲高層啊，咩醫管局主席啊、總裁影都唔見。

345
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,930
而家你見所有醫療事故出現嘅時候咧，好多時。

346
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,230
我幾時話畀你聽？你可以代表我哋嘅本部門去道歉嘅。

347
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:48,160
總之，排隊嘅你一定要將嗰條嗰條隊殺清佢。

348
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,680
有幾多資源，有幾多錢，佢就做幾多嘢；冇幾多資源，你都要做幾多嘅嘢。

349
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,370
只要一個人投訴，你就一定要將佢再褪前一啲，再啃多幾個證。

350
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,110
最低下層嘅，你冇以為醫生叫高高在上喺個制度底下，佢係一隻蟻嚟嘅啫。

351
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:04,090
咁呢啲嘅責任係應該邊個負咧？好，所以有第八條。第八條就係我更加希望將來咧，就係喺道歉之後。

352
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:12,400
我哋調查委員會都未有結論，你自己出去道歉。嗱，有事我唔會負責㗎，你自己咩？不過而家都發生緊啦，主席。

353
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,300
一日嘅訓練。

354
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,320
三個工人。

355
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,300
佢應該咁做。

356
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,060
紅磡必加雞。

357
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,370
表面睇嚟。

358
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,280
機利士南路嘅一個意外。

359
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,400
除咗表示哀痛之後咧。

360
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,650
原來嗰個訓練係一日。

361
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,950
我哋冇聽到太多。

362
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,670
有冇為佢哋自己嘅政策失誤而道歉？

363
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,360
同樣嘅情況底下咧，啱早兩日都發生。

364
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,070
喺香港嘅密閉場所工作，即係話啲深坑工作。

365
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,950
嗰啲負責官員，包括勞工處處長或者新嘅勞福局局長。

366
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:11,110
都能夠咧係保留嘅權利，將後邊令到呢個醫療制度崩潰嘅兇手拎出嚟。

367
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:53,700
喺個深坑入邊，啲水跌落嚟，死於不幸，幾咁即係有理由？大家有冇睇到？其實。

368
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:15,580
我哋有法例㗎，我哋要《工廠暨工業經營條例》入邊定明嘅。其實滿五十人就有個安全督導員，二百五十人有個安全主任。對唔住，你得三個人嘅啫。

369
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,800
使乜督導員啊？

370
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,170
唔會㗎。

371
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,330
燈草啊！

372
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,560
你可以鬧。

373
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,900
咁成件事嘅責任係邊度咧？

374
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,060
仲有啲安全主任好多兼職嘅。

375
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,200
香港佢將個責任咧勞工處就畀咗。

376
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,710
工頭就加埋安全主任，咁點做啊？

377
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,080
安全主任唔使三個啫嘛，你要自己掘掘飽佢。

378
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,660
攞完嗰張叫做同意書license先至可以開工。香港從來唔會行呢樣嘢。

379
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:39,040
咁咪偷雞偷得到就算咯，好彩咪冇事，唔好彩咪死幾個咯。

380
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:32,530
難聽啲神又你鬼又你，要趕工又係你，負責決決定安唔安全又係你。

381
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:15,350
佢然後話：老細，你唔開得工啊！我唔準你開工啊！嗱，你呢樣嗰樣未做好㗎噉樣。

382
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:08,740
如果今次呢單例啊，如果金城就請個安全主任嚟，個安全主任邊個出糧畀佢㗎？

383
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,800
嗰個承建商，承建商咧就做㗎嗱，我有安全主任㗎，個安全主任佢請㗎。

384
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,140
佢哋冇咁做嘅。

385
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,900
嗰間金城。

386
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,230
如果唔係，我哋唔會見到。

387
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,480
有啲嘢好似個平衡噉樣。

388
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,560
所以我有時某某程度上講。

389
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,480
港珠澳大橋死完十件，繼續趕工。

390
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,150
我唔知行完道歉法呢啲人會唔會行出嚟道歉？

391
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,790
不過佢哋咧，對唔住，佢哋冇行到出嚟去道歉。

392
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,400
成個工業安全嘅制度係失效。

393
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,570
佢可能會篤個地區安全主任出嚟道歉。

394
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,040
呢啲密閉場所，即係掘地洞嗰啲咧，死完再死。

395
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,550
夠細啊嘛，督到你，你咪自己道歉道飽佢咯。個處長一定唔關佢事。

396
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,610
調查唔會有事㗎，因為嗰條法例根本就冇令到佢哋做到應該要做嘅嘢。

397
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:32,070
個道歉法，千祈唔好保障個政府，亦都千祈唔好保障勞福局局長同埋勞工處長。

398
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:57,230
跟住金城話：，唔關我事，我照足法嚟做嘅。你見到佢嗰啲嗰啲誒啲老細嗰啲高層話，我冇嘢調查啦噉。

399
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:13,620
有啲嘢要捉實佢，但係對於道歉法，我希望唔好成為係將個責任嫁禍於前線，而令到政府有權嘅人可以逃避責任嘅一個做法。本人近似。要從嚴嚴。

400
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:44,100
所以呢啲所有嘅嘢咧，但係當然唔係冇人出聲嘅。其實你睇人哋，我講人家啦，真係唔好意思講人家。既然嗰個小組都識得引澳洲啊，其他嘅例子，人家嘅做法係需要有一個係派出嚟嘅政府工作人員去個密閉嘅場地嗰度。

401
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,650
規定。

402
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:00,890
好啊。

403
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,310
我都希望。

404
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,130
姚崇豔議員。

405
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,890
就我有啲裝。

406
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,200
係啊！佢唔畀啊！

407
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,730
就係個點一樣啊嘛！

408
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,570
趁呢個機會咧。

409
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,830
可以係。

410
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,740
有不協調嘅地方啦，所以咧。

411
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,280
係唔該，主席。誒就誒。

412
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,700
梁江豪議員，請你翻去換翻一條長褲子入嚟講嘢好嘛？姚崇義議員。

413
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:24,370
由於司長喺二讀嘅時候咧，都有回應到，我就住第八條嘅中英文嘅譯本。

414
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:53,060
我而家係啊，規程問，我而家規程問題係兩個項議員，你係唔莊重，請你翻去換翻條褲。如果你唔換翻條褲嘅咧，我就當你。

415
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:36,780
嘅規程問題，你就係我而家嘅提出嘅規程問題。你嘅衣著係唔莊重，請你請你翻去換翻，請你翻去換翻一條褲，然後再入嚟。

416
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:54,130
展述我對中英文版本字眼上高有不協調地方咧嘅嘅詳細內容，因為咧司長喺回應嘅時候咧，佢用英文講述咧，噉佢就係用咗just and equitable嘅字眼嘅嗱，而事實上咧，我哋誒喺。

417
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,610
去代表嘅。

418
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,800
定義或係。

419
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,910
just and equitable.

420
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,650
以致到專業團體嘅。

421
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,010
斜洞一六一七零一。

422
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,940
咁咧，佢有中英文版本嘅，即係個講稿附錄。

423
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,390
咁但係咧，中文嘅版本咧。

424
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,720
嗱，而事實上咧，有誒。

425
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:58,200
大會嘅文件啊，CB括弧三八三三。

426
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,440
專業操守指引咧都有。

427
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:45,110
中英文版本嘅用詞不一致所導致嘅原因。

428
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:56,080
有大量嘅法律文件啊！

429
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,660
而佢哋嘅中文譯本咧，都係用公平、公正。

430
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:20,920
嗱，而事實上咧，我哋傾咗咁多次喺泛委員會裏邊咧，其實。

431
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:15,660
咁個英文版本咧，佢係好清楚寫住寫住，only if it is just and equitable to do so。

432
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:37,680
係屬公平之舉，而唔係原本嘅版本咧，寫屬公平公正之舉。噉我唔知道係文件嘅手文之誤啊！

433
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,180
嗱，所以咧。

434
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,340
而家。

435
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,580
英文咧。

436
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,500
另外咧。

437
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,930
有兩個係。

438
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,990
佢需要顧及嘅。

439
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,310
及嘅有兩個咧，係滑嘅。

440
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:59,840
兩個原則嘅其中一個啦。

441
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,510
而家嗰個修訂嘅八條二條裏邊，你會見到咧。

442
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,920
然之後咧，另外兩個條件咧，要顧及嘅咧，就係畫嘅。

443
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:26,850
所要求嗰個修訂，而亦都得到政府嘅同意咧。

444
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:36,550
喺大家枱面所見到嗰個修改咧，就係話咧，我哋想將佢變成咧有四個條件。

445
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:57,800
英文咧係just and equitable，咁呢兩個係及嘅，咁所以中文應該係公平及公正。

446
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:17,700
就係having regard to the public interest or the interest of the administration of justice。咁呢兩個係畫嘅，係用or嘅。

447
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:53,370
嘅原原則係劃嘅，就係公眾利益或公義原則，咁先至會喺嗰個裁斷者咧去行使去酌情權嘅時候，去需要考慮。

448
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:37,990
而中文嘅譯本咧，就係顧及公眾利益或公義原則之後，咁所以咧，如果中英文要對對稱咧，其實係應該有四個條件，就係公平係及公正嘅，然之後有兩個顧及。

449
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,990
應該得到嘅。

450
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,890
係符合。

451
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:41,330
裏邊所指出咧。

452
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,810
嚟到要求咧，就係。

453
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,910
有相同嘅標準。

454
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,450
係比公平咧，係更加重要嘅。

455
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,780
係要確定，考慮咗之後咧，係要確定咧。

456
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,760
所以裏邊咧，公正係帶有明顯嘅。

457
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,680
引述咧，可能係一位中學生嘅作品啩？

458
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:46,750
就係話公平同公正兩個詞匯啊！

459
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:09,960
公平係指對待人或者對待事要一視同仁。

460
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:21,770
就得啦，但係公正咧，其實係講緊要給予每一個人。

461
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:04,300
嗱，而實際上咧，公平同公正嘅兩個詞匯係有好重要嘅差別嘅。

462
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:16,400
兩個條件就係公平及公正嘅。嗱，呢度咧，其實我都想誒。

463
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:56,200
係好相近，所以一般人咧喺好多場合咧都會交換噉樣替用呢兩個概念，甚至當為係同一件事。

464
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:34,500
誒台中市立清泉國民中學咧喺網上高一篇就係日明嘅文章咧，裏邊講到公正啊！

465
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,390
但係。

466
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,200
係。

467
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,130
所以點解？

468
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,250
嗱，所以。

469
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,630
價值觀念。

470
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,130
所以喺嗰個。

471
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,200
未必一定係好公正嘅。

472
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,370
公平嘅遊戲規則底下咧。

473
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,490
係由社會公認嘅基本價值取向。

474
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:45,330
我哋判斷佢係咪公平咧，係一個中性嘅意義嚟嘅。

475
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:11,200
係只係講有冇遵守嗰個同一標準嘅規則。

476
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:41,990
強調咧係呢個價值觀念所具有嘅正當性嘅。

477
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:52,680
就即係話啊，係參加者或者喺嗰件誒誒訴訟裏邊，大家都有一個。

478
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:54,480
我希望喺誒呢度討論就係話要加翻公平及公正。

479
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:03,590
不單止係與英文嘅用詞對稱之外咧，更加重要嘅就係話，其實公平咧。

480
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:26,760
噉就一般個裁斷者咧，可能佢個判斷就會話：哦，咁已經係跟咗乜嘢指引啊，跟咗某一啲係制度啊，噉就好公平啦。

481
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,070
噉，但係咧。

482
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,560
梁耀忠議員。

483
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,640
咁但係咧？

484
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,650
會唔會其實係？

485
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,810
未必係屬於公正之舉嘅。

486
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:47,010
去顧及咗公眾利益或者公義原則。

487
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:08,280
究竟呢一個公平嘅原則底下？

488
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:28,040
係令到社會一致都認為咧，噉樣係危害公眾利益。

489
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,750
咁所以似乎有必要咧，係要確立翻。

490
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:59,750
同一嘅標準噉樣咧，我哋就會話啊，已經達到咗公平嘅原則啦。

491
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:06,910
咁喺而家個中文版本咧就會出現，仍然可以行使嗰個酌情權，但係英文版本咧又唔準嘅喎。

492
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:41,780
嗱，所以咧，而家如果用誒現時個中文版本咧，有一個比較奇怪嘅現象就係咩咧？就係可能個裁斷者。

493
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:21,440
導致到有其中一啲係受影響嘅人士咧，係得唔到公正嘅對待。

494
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:23,990
係喺嗰個中文版本裏邊咧，係同英文版本嘅行文咧係有翻個對稱性先至啫。係本人跟錢行事。梁振英。

495
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:40,830
梁邦榮議員，係唔好意思誒，今朝勞煩你指正我。我而家誒覺得咧誒，基本上七第七十三條規定嘅人數咧，似乎同本會現時嘅情況咧不相符。

496
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:22,970
梁國雄議員，你乜嘢虧情問題？因為喺我哋嘅誒講稿裏邊咧，立法會C B括弧三八三三縮十六，even十七，括弧零一號文件咧，第二項辯論，你睇睇唔睇到啊哥？

497
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,390
個錢啊！

498
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,190
佢依家字。

499
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:45,500
主席。

500
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,560
真係一個虧損。

501
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,320
規程問題嘅話咧？

502
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,370
最少唔好審議呢一條。請你坐低。

503
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:05,170
梁國雄議員，如果你再濫用，

504
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:33,810
梁國雄議員，若果你對秘書處提供嘅文件係有任何疑問咧？

505
01:21:54,540 --> 01:22:00,570
相信咧，亦都係守民之伍。我已經答咗你啦。請你坐低，梁耀忠議員。

506
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:24,260
唔錯之前嗰個，即係話包含咗公平公正之舉嗰個咧，呢個真係一個規程問題嚟嘅。

507
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:42,270
因為阿姚崇賢議員咧就指出咗，你你你慢慢呢個真係虧情問題嚟嘅，你慢慢你有啲耐性。

508
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:34,800
你啊啊，主席，你不是提出？係因為規程問題啦。你你因為因為個文本錯咗，點樣搞啊？嗱，因為正話咧，你因為正話你就唔喺度主持。

509
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:43,890
呢個真係規程問題，因為我哋唔可以有一個文本同原來嘅文本係有差異嘅，然後我哋當話守文之誤，然後就話哦當係咁啦，唔得嘅嗱。請你，其實你你講已經答咗你嘅提問，請你不要再濫用規程問題。唔係錯的，梁業忠議員。

510
01:20:42,550 --> 01:21:02,560
喺第八條提出規程問題。如果唔係，我認為你難規程問題。第八條第二段，你有冇文本喺度？中間咧係由我哋提供嘅講稿附錄裏邊咧，有一個日嗰嗰第二段最後尾嗰句啦，屬公平之舉咧。咁正話由姚崇賢議員咧就指出咧，係同政。

511
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:22,570
政府早前提出嘅版本唔同，咁而家知道咗之後咧，其實係守民之誤，屬公平公正之舉。但係而家你畀我個講稿附錄咧，就冇咗公正嗰兩個字，咁到底算定唔算？請你坐低兩位議員。我我認為唔唔改正咧，係唔應該再舉行呢個會議啊！就

512
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:54,540
可以咧喺啊會後同秘書處溝通呢個唔係規程問題，而我瞭解咧呢一個咧係誒文字咧係誒參考法例嘅文本、藍紙草案嘅文本而。

513
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,620
到底？

514
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,340
冇錯嘅。

515
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,730
請你坐低。

516
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,590
你要求？

517
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,180
請你繼續你嘅發言。

518
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,820
請你坐低，梁耀忠議員。

519
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,740
嘅話咧，你係會視為擾亂議會秩序，坐低。

520
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:46,640
需要作出一個正式澄清，究竟係公正公平咧，還是係公平之舉？

521
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:56,880
我希望你慎重考慮，因為如果你個港保附錄係，我已經處理咗你嘅提問。請你坐低，不要再濫用規程問題。

522
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:59,140
你當我呢個發言點樣？點樣？我想要求你嘅發言咧，好唔該，你發言時間，你誒發言完成啦，係嘛？未啊，我未講完㗎，我只係講要求澄清咗先啊，主席。

523
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:19,360
現在唔係討論呢個事宜，現在係梁耀忠議員發言。梁耀忠議員，請你坐低。我司長，我已我正式同你提出警告。若然你提出一啲非規程問題，

524
01:23:40,870 --> 01:24:00,880
主席，誒，我都覺得係即係誒，阿司長或者李閣下咧，係應該澄清一下嘅，因為剛才你所講嘅話咧，係令到我真係好大嘅質疑，因為討論緊呢條嘅八倍二嘅話咧，喺真正嘅我哋所得嘅文件裏邊嚟講話咧，係寫得好清清楚楚，就話。

525
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:20,930
再顧及就就屬公正公平之舉嘅噉，但係不過咧喺誒我哋嘅講稿文件裏邊咧，係只係講係公平之舉。而剛才你就話咧，秘書處係抄政府畀你嗰個嘅文本嚟到係寫出嚟嘅，咁即係話咧係政府寫錯咗咯，係咪咧？

526
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:40,940
如果政府寫錯咗嘅話咧，我都係必須澄清，因為而家我哋討論緊嗰條係真真正嘅藍本嘅嘅嘅條例嚟㗎嘛。如果我哋通過咗，究竟通通過咗係公正公平之舉咧，還是係公平之舉咧？呢個係好大出入嘅。呢個嚟講係噉，所以我覺得喺我哋再進行辯論之前咧，係司長咧必須。

527
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:21,880
邊位澄清啊？我先講咗司長咯，或者你咧？司長一陣間整體回應嘅時候咧，會考慮是否澄清。你繼續發言。主持，咁而家好過困難討論嘅喎。如果我究竟我講嘅討論緊係究竟係公正公平之舉啊，還是係公平之舉咧？噉我究竟係點發言咧？如果我唔，如果司長唔清楚。

528
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:41,890
話嘅話咧，噉我針對住公正公平公平之舉，好好大分別嘅喎。梁議員你好清楚嘅，我哋需要參考男子草案嘅文本係公正公平之舉。議員係明白男子草案嘅文本咧，就係內容啦。你搞錯咗。

529
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,030
陶景新議員。

530
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,460
係。

531
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,300
係冇咗嗰兩個字嘅喎。

532
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,800
都係舊有嘅版本，同埋新嘅版本咧。

533
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,430
噉我哋點通過咧？通過啲乜嘢咧？

534
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:28,090
針對啲有邊一發言咧？事實上，我係想針對住公正公平呢個字眼咧，係發言嘅。

535
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:26,160
據瞭解咧，誒秘書處誒提供嘅內容咧係有手民之誤辯論。

536
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:11,600
點咪屬於更正啫？呢個係更正本嚟㗎嘛？更正本你唔去處理，你處理都係舊嘅呢個原本喎。咁即係究竟係點樣處理呢個問呢個呢個問題咧？

537
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:41,670
議員辯論嘅時候咧，可參考秘書處提供嘅資料，而議員考慮是否通過條例草案咧，係需要考慮藍紙草案提供嘅文本嘅。請你繼續。

538
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:59,690
你唔清楚嘅話咧，我我以為係進行唔到嘅喎，主席。所以我覺得好，我唔嘥時間㗎。我只係覺得司長只不過做一澄清就已經夠啦。點大家清清楚楚？點解你點解你唔做依樣嘢咧？

539
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:57,370
主席，我想再清楚一下，究竟係收文唔知五係秘書處文唔知五啦，還是係政府畀你文件收文知五？因為佢當時你講得好清楚嘅，如果可以翻聽聽大，就係話秘書處係依據政府畀你嘅文件而寫出嚟。

540
01:25:41,890 --> 01:26:01,900
因為咧，我哋今日依份文依份文件咧，係你哋係秘書室畀我哋嘅，係最新嘅版本嚟嘅。依個最新版本係應該係最準確，而家係最依附，即係根據依份嘅藍本去處理啲事情嘅。以前舊啲嘢咧係應該唔再計算嘅。依個係一個我哋一般嘅做法係噉樣樣嘅。

541
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:17,660
咁究竟係邊個審問之問？究竟政政府係咪最後個修訂本係公正咧？係冇公公平咧？咪冇公正？議員，議中議員，我已經清楚澄清你嘅問題啦。若然你繼續辯論咧，啊呢度不是一個合適場合。唔係啊，主席，你你搞錯咗啦。而家我哋通過唔係通過你嘅説話。

542
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:37,670
主席通過草案咧，請參考《男子草案》嘅。噉係唔通唔通嘅喺議會上高嚟通過嘅，唔係通過你嘅説話，而係通過政府所提交畀我哋嘅嘅嘢嘅。如果你話呢份嘢係最後結果係根據政府嘅做嘅話咧，即係政府最後修定嘅喎。

543
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:22,010
我已經好清楚指出係議員應參考。點解你唔點唔答應我？你藍字草案嘅文字內容，司長一陣間發言嘅時候咧，請你澄清好清楚啦。請你繼續發言。唔係啊，主席，你覺得好唔妥啊？噉我究竟係根據依個嘅藍本咧，定根據而家新嘅版版本咧？你噉我覺點？我哋第一同議員同事。

544
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:55,990
誒主席誒，我我我誒誒明白誒。剛才阿梁月忠或者其他同事提出嘅問題，我我有一個建議，我唔知主席可唔可以考慮咧？就係誒，如果真係秘書處一個手民之誤咧，因為誒無謂誒，即係大家複雜化咗咧。如果誒嗰張紙都好簡單，係一一版紙嘅啫。如果主席可唔可以誒？

545
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:20,160
誒好，噉我暫停會議一會處理呢個事情。

546
01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:14,370
我舉例，誒例如停五分鐘，然後誒叫同事咧就誒秘書同住同事印印咗嗰個誒最準確嗰個版本，然後咧就誒取代咗嗰個舊嘅版本。咁大家喺枱面所有嘢就清楚，亦都個辯論亦都聚焦，亦都係好短嘅時間。我希望主席可以考慮下。
