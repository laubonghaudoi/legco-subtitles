4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
啊！各位早晨啊！我哋而家咧係。

5
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,050
夠開會嘅法定人數，亦都夠鐘啦。

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,840
呢六項撥款建議涉及嘅撥款額咧，合共係。

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:52,180
五百六十二億四千三百六十萬元。如果所有嘅撥款建議獲委員通過咧，累積嘅獲批項目將會係十五項，總撥款額咧會達到七百七十二億六千一百七十萬元。

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:32,850
喺二零一六至一七年度嘅立法會會期咧，截至到上次會議，我哋係審批咗九個項目，總撥款額咧係二百一十億一千八百一十萬元。連同五月六號會議未完成審議嘅五份文件咧，今日會議嘅議程上咧總共有六份文件咧要討論嘅。

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,060
二零一七至一八嘅二號文件。

10
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,970
九千三百三十萬元嘅，我呢度提醒委員。

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,660
喺就該事宜發之前咧，係披露有關利益嘅性質。

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,360
以前項目一咧係二七二LS啟德體育園文件係PWSC。

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:31,600
我亦都請委員咧注意議事規則第八十四條有關喺有直接金錢利益嘅情況之下表決嘅規定。

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,760
假如委員就今日會議嘅討論嘅項目有直接或者間接金錢利益嘅話咧，請委員按照議事規則第八十三A條嘅規定。

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:03,810
撇除咗土地徵用同埋電腦化計劃整體撥款項目嘅二十八億六千八百四十萬元撥款咧，工程項目嘅總撥款額咧係七百四十三億。

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:53,640
呢份文件係建議將272LS工程計劃嘅餘下部分提升為甲級，按付款當日價格計算咧，估計所需費用係三百一十八億九千八百萬元。

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,160
就民政事務局嘅體育專員楊德強先生，民政事務局嘅。

18
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:09,880
出席會議答覆委員提問公職人員咧，係有民政事務局嘅常任秘書長馮承宋怡女士。

19
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,730

誒首席助理秘書長羅麗丹女士，民政事務局高級建築師麥尚清先生。

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,360
本小組委員會喺五月六號嘅會議上已經開始討論呢份文件㗎啦，今日咧會繼續有關嘅討論。

22
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:33,270
仲有咧係不壞覓諮詢香港有限公司嘅有兩位誒總監，就係Mr. Michael。

23
00:02:48,840 --> 00:03:00,270
噉啊！喺今日嘅會議開始嘅時候咧，我就想誒請咧係顧問公司嘅代表咧，就先做一個簡介。

make part of the presentation.

27
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,090
Okay. Yo, so please. Okay. So, thank you.

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,420
哦，你咪有有嘢想講嘛？OK，噉啊請下餘生先嚇，唔該。

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:15,670
And secondly, on two particular items that have been proposed as part of being a successful implementation of this procurement model, namely the introduction of bid incentives and also the length of the contract.

30
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:59,880
We've been we've been asked to comment this morning on three particular items. Firstly, on the procurement model decision with regard to the Kitec Sports Park, and in particular, why design-build-operate is an appropriate solution for the project.

31
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,880
project。

32
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,980
謝謝，主席。

33
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,100
We.

34
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,830
潛在採購模式。

35
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,900
Okay, so Mr. Kamalengo, okay.

36
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,420
And that it should allow an appropriate allocation of risk across the project.

37
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:40,600
It should provide an ability for the project to be developed as a vibrant, as a functional, and as an integrated precinct.

38
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,750
There were two reports prepared, and these had concluded that DBO was an appropriate solution for this.

39
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:50,190
它應該允許所需的政府控制，來讓政府的目標、政策目標得以達成。

40
00:05:50,670 --> 00:06:00,210
And it should also be implementable, and in that way, we were looking as to the experience that government had with the particular contract structure.

41
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:12,170
So in total, we looked at nine different models against these priorities, and Michael will now describe in a bit more detail the results of that analysis.

42
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:58,440
One of the first tasks which we were charged with as operations consultant was to re-evaluate these proposals through a thorough analysis of the different.

43
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:52,180
The design-build-operate model, that involves government funding the upfront design and construction costs, with the private sector designing, building and operating the project over a an extended contract period.

44
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:10,170
Design-build-finance-and-operate effectively involves the private sector funding the upfront costs of design and construction, but government indirectly funding those costs through a service payment that also includes a portion for operating costs. So it's a fixed guaranteed payment model.

45
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:39,580
As Alistair mentioned, we analysed nine options and a series of variations on those options. The early we have we've listed each of those options here on the first slide we have on the on the screen. I'll briefly talk about these five options, but come back to them in a bit more detail later.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:37,010
Thank you, Chairman. It's actually Mr. Graham, Alistair Graham from KPMG, making the presentation with Mr. Camerlengo. Oh, not Mr. You, Mr. You. Okay, okay. So maybe the secretary got some different information. So it's Mr. Graham. And I will start, and then Mr. Camerlengo will also.

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:36,850
So KPMG and Advisian were appointed as operation consultants to the Home Affairs Bureau in July 2015. But prior to our appointment, considerable work had been done on various aspects of the project, including the procurement model. There were two.

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:27,290
We we undertook this analysis by assessing various different models against what were the agreed key priorities for government for the project. And the the agreed priorities that we were looking for from the procurement models were that it should represent for the government value for money.

49
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,320
very briefly.

50
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,850
Joint venture.

51
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,330
build、operate and transfer。

52
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,120
Number seven on the slide is.

53
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,630
所以，我們 expect 會有零 market 興趣喺呢個 model。

54
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,270
and as I said, I'll come back to those options in a moment.

55
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,340
and or because there would be limited or nil market interest in these models.

56
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,590
政府的貢獻 under this model would only be the land the land component.

57
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,340
第五模型 here is very similar to the fourth， with the exception that government would operate the precinct once developed。

58
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,440
一個初始設計和 operate 諮詢契約，followed by 一個 build 契約，followed by 一個 operate 契約。

59
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,830
this involves the government and a private consortium effectively funding and developing the project jointly, with shared control.

60
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:17,310
this involves the private sector financing all of the design and capital costs of the project, but also taking all risk of operations on the project.

61
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:03,840
The downside of this model is that it involves nil construction or builder input into the initial planning, potentially leading to a highly expensive build proposition.

62
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:59,820
We also looked at another four options, which are on the slide, which we ruled out because where they were considered undesirable or unviable against the objectives that Alistair mentioned.

63
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:35,040
Design and build, followed by a private sector operating contract. That involves government tendering a design and build contract, subsequently with a with a private sector operations contract being entered into.

64
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:38,480
這模型被判定為財務上不 viable。Effectively， The project would not generate enough cash flow to be both operationally self-financing and also repay the capital that was invested at the front end.

65
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,750
Number eight.

66
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,310
潛在的吸引性解決方案， on the table.

67
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,370
所以， in terms of the design, build, finance and operate model.

68
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,480
potentially leading to a precinct that is less functional.

69
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,090
Separate contracts for design, build and operation.

70
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,960
我 now just go back to the original five options that we talked about.

71
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,800
在 addition， the subsequent operator appointment is compromised.

72
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,590
The final model here is an operate first.

73
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,660
ultimately leading to very little risk transfer that government would be able to achieve.

74
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,370
So just to summarise, we ruled those four options on the current slide out quite early on.

75
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,340
consultancy contract，followed by a design and build contract appointment。

76
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,580
and or expensive to construct, and or has limited to nil operator market interest in the pro in the project.

77
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:39,600
The downside of this model is that it involves nil integrated input across the three disciplines into the overall planning approach.

78
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:58,010
And we for these options, the approach that we took was to compare them against the design-build-operate model that was adopted in the early earlier analysis, to make sure that or to ensure that the right approach had been is being taken.

79
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:24,600
whilst the early operator that is appointed in the consultancy may be suitable, other operators in the market may determine that the end product does not meet their requirements, and as such, the initial operator would have a high degree of leverage over government in the ultimate negotiations.

80
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:27,750
challenge with this model is that it involves reduced competitive tension amongst operators looking to form part of a design and build team. So effectively, government only gets one operator solution that goes into their design and build proposals. So it loses the benefit of having multiple options to consider, and maybe leaving a

81
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,160
very briefly.

82
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,250
which may or may not be attractive.

83
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,750
challenge is with this model are that

84
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,780
effectively，meaning government has less control。

85
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,580
Turning to the joint venture model.

86
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,210
not attractive from that point of view in terms of risk transfer.

87
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,750
The third model which we'd like to compare against the DBO is.

88
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,860
this is a model that is somewhat familiar in Hong Kong. Examples include Hong Kong Disneyland and Asia World Expo.

89
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,720
In addition, this model has not been used before in Hong Kong, and there is limited experience in this market of doing so.

90
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,340
一個Approach that involves a design and build contract first, followed by a private sector operator contract.

91
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:15,280
政府會有效地別為股東，而作為股東，它會接受一高程度的風險，與最終成功項目的項目。

92
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:11,360
One of the major downsides of this is that it involves government being exposed to a higher degree of operating risk under the under the contract.

93
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:40,500
在terms of the final obstacle here， we are also aware of recent criticism of this model in some quarters in terms of its track record in the Hong Kong market。

94
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:42,920
在 addition， because the private sector would be effectively financing the upfront costs， they would have greater bargaining power in ensuring they have full control over the project and its ultimate direction.

95
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:28,280
在 terms of control and ownership， Government would have enter a shared arrangement with the private sector consortium， and that would be subject to the agreement that is ultimately concluded between the parties.

96
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:26,590
作為我提到，呢個模型涉及政府支付一個保證的固定服務付款，喺合約嘅期間，包括一個成分嚟償還與起始建設成本同運營成本相聯係嘅債務同股權。

97
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,940
On the.

98
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,910
ultimately.

99
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,730
所以， in conclusion.

100
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,440
followed by government ultimately operating the precinct.

101
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,290
The fourth model, which I've already referred to, involves again a design and build contract.

102
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,420
Their international networks, their ability to generate and create events and concepts.

103
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:04,410
This model involves very little, if not no, operator input into the initial planning and design.

104
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:11,640
which which would lead to limited or nil appetite from the international operator market to accept risk on the project.

105
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:16,560
and in addition, we believe there would be reduced potential to achieve a vibrant, attractive precinct. The reason for this is that

106
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:08,000
again，this model involves government taking all operating risks on the project，which is considered undesirable against government's objectives for this project.

107
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:26,000
very simply, the project loses the benefit of the private sector expertise. They lose the benefit of their the project loses the benefit of their commercial mindset.

108
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:46,050
There is also the potential for future disputes or complaints from operators who were not involved in the initial planning and construction of the said project.

109
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:21,860
what it would then mean is that government would need to provide a management fee or service fee payment to the ultimate operator, with government accepting a high risk exposure on the contract.

110
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:45,360
The private sector skills in operating a precinct that has commercial facilities, sports facilities and community facilities in an attractive manner would be diminished.

111
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:03,720
procurement model selection process, our analysis reconfirmed that the design-build-operate model best meets government's priorities and objectives for the project.

112
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:35,720
In addition to to that, the reduced volume of operator input into design and planning means that the prospects would lead to a less functional, less vibrant, less integrated precinct compared to the DBO.

113
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,180
並。

114
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,340
however。

115
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,900
我 now cover off on the concept of bid incentive.

116
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,730
Unlike most other infrastructure or sports infrastructure projects.

117
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,210
We have had to look at a series of contractual measures to optimise this model.

118
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,040
As said on the slide, this model is not without its challenges, like all other models.

119
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,560
給ing the greatest chance of the project achieving an integrated, functional and vibrant outcome.

120
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,330
transfer transfer of a majority of risk to the private sector, particularly during operations.

121
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,960
Achieving maximum operator input into upfront design and planning and construction and the construction process.

122
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:55,970
and to ensure that government can realise its vision and objectives for the project, and achieve maximum benefits for the people of Hong Kong.

123
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:10,260
兩 of these measures which we've been asked to discuss today relate to bid incentive and contract length.

124
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:58,300
The model for the Kai Tak Sports Park involves a complex mix of community facilities, major events facilities and commercial facilities. It is quite diverse.

125
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:42,110
Why has this issue been raised? It has not. It has not happened in a project before in Hong Kong of this scale. Essentially, it's because of the unique nature of this project. It is an exceptional project.

126
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:29,790
所以，什麼是個bid incentive？非常簡潔，這涉及政府支付一定金額給失敗的競標人，來激勵市場上的競標人參與這個項目。

127
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:38,560
在 addition， this model also allows for sufficient levels of government control, oversight and visibility during the operating period， through appropriate contract contractual measures.

128
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:19,110
And as such, for a team to be able to bid on this, they need to bring a diverse set of expertise and skills to the table. Skills across sports events management, community facilities, retail facilities, open space events, entertainment events, commercial sales, construction, investment expertise.

129
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,200
In addition.

130
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,550
what we mean by that is.

131
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,120
We also feel that with

132
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,280
aspect to help resolve that challenge.

133
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,010
design expertise， and the list goes on and on.

134
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,820
所以， as such, we believe the bid incentive is is a key.

135
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,430
This bid incentive groups will be able to deliver higher quality proposals.

136
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,750
Teams with multiple groups are required to come together to make this project happen.

137
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:46,790
但什麼係的優點呢？呢個方法？為為咩我們説呢個方法會增加價值？呢個項目會增加價值？政府會增加價值？香港市民會增加價值？

138
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:21,440
In addition, a unique feature of this project is the desire to transfer all risk. The desire for this to be self-financing during operations.

139
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:32,330
bringing these skills together in a single organisation, we don't believe is possible. There are no organisations out there that can handle this by themselves. As such,

140
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:11,570
In addition, the scale of the project is huge, huge in the scheme of the global sports infrastructure landscape. One of the largest projects in the world, if not at the current time.

141
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:12,540
它也 opens up the field to smaller high-skilled players that may not have as much financial capacity to bear the bidding costs as some of the larger groups in this space.

142
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:58,600
First of all, we think it will enhance the chances of getting a a deep enough field to bid for this project. As I said, it's already very hard for groups to come together on this project because of its scale and complexity.

143
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:37,230
All of these factors mean that teams need to pull together a comprehensive bidding approach, which will lead to significant tender costs. Our estimates are in the order of 100 to 200 million Hong Kong dollars to bid for this project. I'll come back to that in a moment.

144
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:54,220
And that is not easy. That's a challenge. The reason that's a challenge is because it requires other group, a range of groups, to trust each other, to bid with each other, and to make sure that they can put put their best foot forward to win this project, taking on the risk that if they are unsuccessful, they will have lost a lot of money.

145
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,230
For example.

146
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,710
however。

147
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,110
那係第一個坎。

148
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
所以，just moving to the final slide on bid incentive.

149
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,400
Groups must pass through the pre-qualification stage, which has a series of requirements that need to be met.

150
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,110
在 addition， they must submit a compliant tender， a compliant proposition to government.

151
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:01,780
For example, we we have put in a series of requirements that would that would be that need to be passed.

152
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:53,940
this this this is an exceptional proposition, and and we we know that it needs to be structured in a way that prevents abuse and only allows genuine parties to access it.

153
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:33,730
money being made available means they will put in more front end planning, which will lead to improved models around design, construction, operations and their financial planning.

154
00:19:49,900 --> 00:20:01,230
greater front end planning will also lead to more accurate construction planning, more accurate cost estimation, and reduced risk around cost overruns. A very desirable outcome for this project given its scale.

155
00:21:49,140 --> 00:22:01,380
And then the final hurdle is that they need to produce evidence of their expenditure and apply for the incentive. So this is not a straightforward process that will just involve payment automatically. It involves a rigorous assessment.

156
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:47,520
That in turn increases the prospects for greater income generation out of this project, which in turn increases the government's prospects for for receiving a greater share of that income as a partner in this project.

157
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:24,100
第二，ly， if they are successful to proceed through to tender stage， they must submit a tender bond。 if they do if they withdraw from the tender process， they will lose that tender bond。 so only genuine parties would proceed at that that point。

158
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:41,750
In conclusion, our recommendation is for a bid incentive of 60 million Hong Kong dollars, or 50% of the total tender costs of the unsuccessful bidders, being provided, whichever is lower.

159
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:20,130
在 addition， the final benefit is the fact that by providing this bid incentive， government will be able to receive the intellectual property of the unsuccessful tenderers， which may lead to significant value that can also be incorporated into the ultimate project beyond what the successful tenderer has proposed。

160
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:48,390
for that to be the case, it involves a lot of work in understanding government's requirements around functionality, design, operations and various other aspects. That would involve significant time, work and resources to get there. They cannot just put something here for for free and expect to to receive this money.

161
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,650
In short.

162
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,010
And of course, their extensive own internal teams.

163
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,270
在加拿大，The Champlain Bridge Corridor Project。

164
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,610
just coming back to the figure around 60 million or 50%.

165
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,860
第二點，這裡是around our analysis of international precedents.

166
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,510
which would quickly lead to costs in the order of 100 to 200 million over the bidding time frame.

167
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:15,890
The rationale for that figure was derived from a detailed analysis of three different areas.

168
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:09,880
had a bid incentive of Hong Kong $58 million against a capital cost of Hong Kong $23 billion.

169
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:23,830
我們 undertook a bottom-up man-hours estimate of what the true cost would be for a private sector group to bid for this project.

170
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:44,430
where it happens is in markets where there are sophisticated infrastructure, contractual approaches, markets like Canada and Australia.

171
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:11,850
所以，what this leads to very quickly is a is a large team working very heavily over a six month period. We estimate there would be more than 100 people involved in each bid.

172
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:35,370
We acknowledge this is not a typical approach. This is not not does not happen regularly all over the world. It happens on exceptional projects, and as already stated, we believe this project is an exceptional project.

173
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:38,130
Groups would need to pull together skills and people from from a range of disciplines: architecture, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, civil and engineering.

174
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:58,140
例如，在澳大利亞，喺悉尼輕軌項目，一筆 incentive of 香港$3000萬被提供給競標人，對應資本成本約為香港$9.5億。

175
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:57,480
專業設計夥伴從球場發展、可摺疊屋頂設計、ICT、聲學、草皮和各種其他。他們還需要廣泛的來自法律顧問、運營顧問、設施管理顧問、量測師。

176
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,610
and.

177
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,300
和，The。

178
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,680
That addresses the.

179
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,170
Okay，Mr. Grandpre。

180
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,030
And this this comes with risks, and.

181
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,390
Project challenges in this regard relate to the fact that.

182
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,120
continue to point towards the benefits of undertaking this approach.

183
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,620
have also provided, all of which have been successful projects.

184
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,920
at the same time, this project is taking place within the KITAC development.

185
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,930
This is a new, this is a greenfield investment that is taking place.

186
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,660
concept of bid incentive. I'll now pass back to Alistair to discuss contract length.

187
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,290
Thank you. So the second contractual item which we were asked to comment on is the is the length of the contract.

188
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:03,810
the risk of them bidding and make them more likely to bid. So we think all of these factors and the discussion that has just just happened.

189
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:55,770
Although government is funding a significant amount of money into this project, the private sector will also be asked to take risk.

190
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:15,420
At best, this will be a building site for at least the next 10 years, and it probably will take longer for it to become established as a as a second city centre for Hong Kong.

191
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:30,530
and the recently completed Sydney Convention Centre had a bid incentive of Hong Kong thirty million dollars against a capital cost of Hong Kong eight point eight billion dollars. These are a sample of examples. There are more out there, but they highlight that the the figure being proposed for the Kai Tak Sports Park is within the range of of what these projects have also.

192
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:55,900
and finally market feedback, we've carried out extensive engagement with groups across the market, construction groups, developers, investors, operators, and the consistent feedback has been the complexity of this project makes it difficult to bid, and and a bid incentive would make it would would reduce the

193
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,620
O.K.

194
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,950
This is something that I I would like to clarify before we go to the Q and A.

195
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,030
And also at the same time, we're looking for the business of sport to develop further within Hong Kong.

196
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:22,700
所以，我們的建議在這方面是，合同應該是至少25年長度。

197
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,270
誒，你説明啲誒，啲 reason of proposing the big incentive。

198
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:06,360
And at the same time, we think that the contract length clause needs to allow the potential for government.

199
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:42,120
所以我們 looked at this in terms of what we feel the contract length should be. We've undertaken.

200
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,970
We also recommend that there should be an extension option, which again should be subject to performance and ultimately would be at government's discretion.

201
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:16,090
To extend contracts with potentially successful consortium, you don't want to lose that that opportunity.

202
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:25,590
We're asking the consortium to build a business from nothing, to build a brand, and as I say, this this comes with investment in time and in money.

203
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:49,830
So can you explain? You know, is it the your estimate on you know really potential number of bidders would be four?

204
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:58,440
Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentation. Okay, thank you. Before we go to the Q&A session, I would like to carry on a couple of points.

205
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:38,370
are totally four bidders, or as you the term you use in page eleven, the these bidders are most likely consortium.

206
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:36,170
But it should have within that time robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the consortium is performing, and also allow government specific termination rights, largely against performance.

207
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:58,660
分析 of the risk profile of the project by using various sensitivity and scenario analysis. We've looked at the fact that we need the consortium to be incentivised to invest in this project.

208
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:25,630
And in the proposal from the government here, the the total amount budget for that is the one hundred and eighty million Hong Kong dollar. That means the target is the award to three unsuccessful bidders. So together with the successful one, that means.

209
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,040
就。

210
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,160
林卓廷議員。

211
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,820
OK， so I understand。

212
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,830
我係 going to answer this.

213
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,730
特別係嗰啲未提問過嘅嚇。

214
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,070
Michael，Thank you, Chairman.

215
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,520
Builders with quality kind of three to four, right?

216
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,390
好，而家咧先到啊，林卓廷議員第一次嘅四分鐘。

217
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:35,540
誒，誒，請想係提問嘅同事按提問嘅按鈕。

218
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,470
unless the 50% measure is is is incorporated, so does does that clarify your your question?

219
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:53,300
啊，兩個議員，我哋唔可能因為任何一次新文件咧，我又從頭開始計四三二一噉樣嚇。

220
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:31,820
三會 be unsuccessful， and that would lead to a total bid incentive maximum of 180 million.

221
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:29,120
誒，好，噉我哋而家就進入我哋嘅提問環節。我睇翻誒上一次已經係按鈕與提問嘅同事先嚇。

222
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:17,960
Thank you, Chairman. That is what we are targeting. There are no certainties as to how many bidders will ultimately bid for this until they see the tender documents. But through our engagement, we believe there is the prospect of achieving three or four bidders, all going well.

223
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:24,530
It is a good question. Our target is to achieve a minimum of three to four bidders. Yes, we believe that is the sufficient level of competitive to achieve competitive tension and to deliver the best to deliver the best outcome for the project. So, to answer the on the figure side of things, that would if there were four bidders.

224
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,200
啊，唔該，主席，就誒有關呢個。

225
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,150
制嘅誒潛力咧，亦都係好大嘅，所以其實我就諗嚟諗去都諗唔明。

226
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,390
講應該係賺到錢㗎嘛？個利潤我唔知道啦，大家而家都好難估算啦。

227
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:59,570
財團都可能會邀請佢入標㗎嘛，即係咁優越嘅位置，其實政府係咪再諗一諗，係咪要用一個即係？

228
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,700
我就睇翻成個計劃咧，你哋現在預計咧係會篩選最多四個投標者出嚟。

229
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:30,850
財團啦噉樣，現在你哋嗰個估算咧就話嗰個入標嘅成本咧就一億二，噉你哋就話誒最多補貼佢哋誒六千萬左右啦噉樣。

230
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:18,630
啟德體育園嘅發展區咧，其實一個最大嘅爭議就係關於係唔係會誒提供一個補貼啊，畀嗰啲入標嘅誒。

231
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:59,100
Okay, so that means the consultant actually has some assessment on the potential bidders in the global market. And well, with this complicated project, you're expecting the number of really potential bidders.

232
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:59,990
咁誒嗰個體德體育園區嗰個位置咧，其實係講緊喺誒體德站啦、土瓜環站啦，同埋誒九龍城碼頭中間嘅位置，佔嘅地方亦都好廣。其實係誒九龍區嘅誒中心地帶。

233
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:20,000
啦，咁其實一幅咁重要嘅土地咧，其實誒佢當然我明白入邊嘅商業設施咧，其實唔係話認真好多，但係咧佢吸納到嘅人流咧，係未來可以係好龐大，對誒鄰近嘅地區咧嗰個經。

234
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:45,440
點解政府係咁誒悲觀，係即係覺得會有好多啲財團唔係好想入呢個標咧？其實我調轉嚟覺得冇理由唔入啊！如果政府邀請到你，你差唔多有四分一機會中到標啊！而中到標嘅話，政府亦都畀咗。

235
00:32:45,440 --> 00:33:05,450
嗰啲建築成本啊，等等啦，營運嗰個係要有成本啦。但係誒喺咁大嘅計劃、咁優越嘅位置，係唔係做唔到咧？我覺得佢應該賺到錢嘅，即係如果係一個商業營運嚟講，即係政府營運我就唔敢有信心啦。商業營運嚟。

236
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:31,680
嗱，可以講緊廿五年係講幾十億，甚至更加多嘅利潤㗎嘛？咁點解即係政府係咁悲觀咧？同埋呢個即係做法咧，即係回翻畀誒嗰啲投標者幾千萬嘅做法咧？喺香港我就未聽過。頭先講。

237
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:51,690
話國際有啲經驗啦，係嘛？誒，即係呢個做法其實係係唔係會令到成件事誒社會嘅疑慮仲大咗咧？定係用翻我哋傳統嘅入標嘅方式更加好咧？同埋頭先，我聽到好似話，除咗本地嘅、海外嘅。

238
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,490
Yes, I think. Mr. Graham.

239
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,620
是 probably enough to dissuade.

240
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,340
And I think one of the aspects of that that has to be considered is that.

241
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:19,130
assets. These are generally provided as social infrastructure. These are generally not

242
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,320
We think, based on our market research, we're talking to companies, is beyond what they would probably be willing to take.

243
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:57,550
所以，從The Bidding Side Alone，It's A Very Complex Project。It's A Huge Ask，100 To 200 Million For A One In Four Chance。

244
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:28,580
You know, certainly on an investment level, not, but they don't provide a return without any date. They hopefully will break even and make a small profit.

245
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:57,700
Where you are asking a consortium of companies to invest 100 to 200 million Hong Kong dollars for a one in four chance or a one in three chance of winning the project.

246
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:39,970
所以係一個複雜的project，係唔係一個簡單的問題，和你知，嗰個複雜性單獨，加上投資的規模，係有一成四的機會贏。

247
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:47,010
I think it's it's it's it is a complex project. Let's let's not we can't get away from that. And I think you have to look at it in two different stages. You have to look at it as the bid at the bidding stage.

248
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:13,750
咧，佢哋係唔會入標嘅。咁可能最終咧，只係得翻一個或者兩個好細。但係，秘書長而家講緊係西政三四個入標者啫喎，佢有三分一、四分一機會中到標喎。

249
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:12,260
Then you come to the operating side, where you you made the comment that you know it's such a huge project, but on the other hand, this is a stadium, an arena, and a public sports ground. These are not normal investment type.

250
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:32,620
即係你你都話係可以誒誒營運上係維持到嘅，點解佢唔會試下咧？你攞一億零去搏未來可能好龐大嘅利潤，即係做生意從來都係咁㗎啦，係嘛？係我我或者請阿誒，sorry，Leon，再補充一下input from the consultants。

251
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:20,240
前所未見嘅誒，即係入標嘅方式去做咧。唔該啊，主席係誒，或者首先我答，啊，主席長請誒顧文再補充誒。根據我哋提供畀立法會嘅文件咧，頭嗰五年咧，如果係一個叫做基本嘅個情況咧，即係話都相對穩定嘅咧，誒。

252
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:40,250
已經喺第四五年度咧，會有一少少嘅收入嘅。咁整體嚟講咧，我哋覺得呢一個嘅計劃咧，唔係唔商業上可行嘅，因為只要政府畀咗嗰個嘅興建嘅費用，但係個問題就係話呢個只係中咗標嗰一個投標者就可以攞到呢一啲嘅利潤。落咗標嗰三個咧，其實就係即係可以話豆領都冇。

253
00:34:40,250 --> 00:35:00,260
佢就付出咗一億至兩億嘅投標嘅成本，咁所以咧，我哋喺誒顧問同好多間嘅公司，即係無論係本地或海外去討論嘅時候咧，佢哋覺得呢一個標書係好難做，同埋咧亦都係嗰個成本會好高，即係認真去做一個標書嘅成本係好高。如果冇一啲嘅好似其他外國噉嘅投標有。

254
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:18,520
The these companies, whether they be construction companies or whoever, and that's another whole issue as to who's the right company to bid for this. That is a huge amount of money against their budget for bidding for projects annually. So it is a huge ask, without any doubt at all, and it's an ask which.

255
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:49,640
You know who's the right company to take that risk? Because this is a construction company, but actually you're asking a construction company to take risk over 25 years of operating, and yet they have to fund the bid cost for a long project like that. It's not a developer because it's not really a development. There's no land ownership in this. It's purely an operating con.

256
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,140
人喺度咩？

257
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,940
係，唔該啊，主席。

258
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,660
咁誒，另外一個問題咧，係關於政府最新提供嘅誒。

259
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:25,930
係，好，跟住到下一位啊，梁志祥議員第二次嘅三分鐘。

260
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:11,820
咁最終頭誒誒第三點嗰度咧，就係誒關於嗰個有經驗嘅國際同埋本地機構人員組成有效管理誒。

261
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:20,410
體育園嘅日常運作呢個真係都係一啲假基本假設嚟嘅，可能即係陳議員覺得冇乜意義，或者應該係一個即係taking for granted嘅一個嘅條件。

262
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:50,130
誒要求幾多錢做呢個提案？有人咧，亦都係會由民政事務局同埋我哋有一隊嘅誒測量嘅顧問，我哋個QS consultant係會同我哋一齊去審核嘅。

263
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:20,890
文件一六一七零一號文件補充關於啟德誒項目嘅營運資料嘅，噉我睇到附件二嘅一般營運假設咧，我就覺得都有啲奇怪嘅，因為一般營運假設咧有啲誒。

264
00:40:50,460 --> 00:41:03,980
而事實上咧，佢亦都要喺較早嘅時間咧，已經一早係講咗佢會要求嗰個投提提案有因係幾多錢，唔係落咗標之後先同我哋講嘅，亦都要有具體嘅證據由核數師去審核嘅一啲嘅數據嘅。

265
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:40,030
情況咧應該係喺個營運者控制唔到嘅嘢，譬如你話通脹啊，誒有誒誒天災人禍啊，政治事件。但係佢嘅第二頁咧，竟然有一條係承辦商會由有經驗的國際及本地機構人員組成，有效管理。

266
00:37:43,870 --> 00:38:03,880
O.K.噉啊，下一位啦，就陳振英，月第二次嘅三分鐘啊。唔該，主席。噉我其實本來好多嘢想瞭解嘅，不過誒先將重點嘅問一問啦。噉我都係想誒問翻提案有因，即係個誒投影片裏邊第十二頁咧，都提到咧就係話，好處之一咧就政府可以使用所有標書中嘅。

267
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:23,890
知識產權咁上次都提過啦。噉我想問咧，就係邊個會最後決定用一啲落選入標者嘅知識產權咧？因為我哋有一個中標啦，三個落選啦。咁嗰個中標者梗係覺得自己嘅設計係最好㗎啦。點解會攞咗另外三個落選者嘅部分設計？

268
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:43,900
係進入我哋最後嗰個園區嘅設計咧，咁邊一個係會做呢個決定咧？係政府啊、顧問公司啊，定係中標者咧？咁呢個係第一個問題。第二個問題咧，誒喺呢個投影片第十三頁都講咧，會設立完善機制咧，避免濫用嘅。咁但係我想問啦，佢誒要證明，即係嗰三個。

269
00:38:43,900 --> 00:39:03,910
落標者咧，證明佢用咗個成本咧，噉係有由邊個去誒審查呢啲費用係咪合理咧？誒，政府審計處啊，定係話邊一個會誒介入，令到咧真係因為畀嗰六千萬就真係由政府畀嘅，咁邊個會可以睇到即係誒審查翻呢啲噉嘅支出係咪合理咧？

270
00:39:40,310 --> 00:40:00,320
體育員日常運作，咁呢個咧永遠都係營辦者自己有權去控制嘅條件嚟嘅。咁點解會擺落去作為一個假設咧？你話除非咧，假設就係誒世界上有足夠的誒，即係管理人才可以供聘用，咁咁都仲可以講得過去。咁變咗承辦商會由呢樣嘢組成，噉係一。

271
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:20,330
個假設咧，我呢個假設我就覺得比較奇怪啲咯。唔該曬主席，係邊位回答？誒，主席，我先答一答。誒，就住嗰個嘅誒誒知識產權咧，最終我哋譬如話已經揀咗一個嘅中標者咧，其他三個我哋發現係有一啲嘅好嘅元素，係可以擺落去個中標最終個設計或者營運嘅計劃裏邊咧，我。

272
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,550
係。

273
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:56,990
公司。

274
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,430
翻嚟嘅標咧，可能去到四百幾億都唔定。咁呢個咧，我覺得係。

275
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:57,120
所以咧就誒誒預料咧呢班都係有實力嘅人。

276
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:44,770
即係即係咁講，點講啊？嚟到呢度問我哋攞錢，我哋即係話同唔同意呢一種誒模式咧？即係即係難以決定。

277
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:39,650
誒嗱，呢一種嘅模式咧，其實即係一早係預料應該係唔會多人投，即係我上一次問即係提誒提名嘅時候都提咗呢個觀點。

278
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:34,470
睇到應該喺一個穩定嘅情況底下咧，個收入咧係可以超過嗰個支出嘅。咁呢一個應該都會有一啲嘅投標者係願意入嚟咧，以我哋而家呢個模式咧嚟到係仲誒落標嘅。

279
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:52,030
咁誒，因為你你呢個係非常巨大嘅一個投資同埋項目啦，咁唔可能咧誒，即係好多公司有呢種經驗或者呢種能力。

280
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:30,740
誒資助呢啲嘅投標者去做一啲嘅經費咧，噉佢哋又唔肯投，噉啊變咗個競爭又冇。對政府相對嚟講咧，你而家我係政府係預計三百幾億嘅，可能。

281
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:21,970
咁如果轉第二個人去做嘅，咁亦都未必係可以即係成立得到。佢話會將來都繼續有一個即係營運嘅能力，或者叫做有有盈利喺度啦。噉啊冇人做嘅喎，咁呢個時候係咪政府都會收翻自己做咧？

282
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:40,340
我哋由政府咧係會提出嘅，喺標書裏邊亦都會講得好清楚。無論係任何一個投標，你中標落標咧，嗰個知識產權我哋都可以使用。中標者亦都要接受政府咧提出咧，要加入一啲其他標書我哋覺得好嘅元素入去嗰個嘅誒標書裏邊，個最終嘅設計裏邊。至於個成本嗰個嘅審核咧，即係話佢。

283
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:17,410
咁當然啦，即係可能政府已經摸底啦嚇。即係我呢度講唔知啱唔啱呢個詞啊，摸底都基本上呢啲公司都，如果係咁大嘅投資又未必得嘅咧，佢唔肯制㗎啦。咁唔肯制咧，即係如果用呢種誒再用呢一種模式咧，必然係有一種噉嘅後果喺度，就話政府唔畀錢。

284
00:42:45,190 --> 00:43:05,200
咁第二個咧就係嗱，我亦都有一個疑問喺度咧，就係誒，如果係由翻呢一個建築，即係呢一個投標者，即係獲標嘅人咧去設計，噉你個年期咧畀到廿五年佢啦。咁萬一喺途中已經啊，即係即係嗰個氣候唔好啊，誒個營運係差嘅。

285
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:43,070
係誒，秘書長係誒，多謝主席。其實點解要有廿五年咧？五年建築期，二十年嘅營運期，亦都係要即係畀足夠嘅時間嗰個嘅中標嘅誒承辦商咧，係有機會去揾到錢、賺錢，同埋同我哋分賬。咁當然，如果去到一個嘅好唔理想嘅情況，呢一個嘅誒承辦商。

286
00:43:43,070 --> 00:44:03,080
係表現不佳，我哋要同佢終結嗰個嘅關係，又或者即係佢誒自己唔想再做，咁當然佢唔想再做，我哋就有嗰個保證金嗰樣嘢啦。上次會議都提到啦，呢一個我哋係會沒收佢嘅保證金咯。咁到最後，如果真係話喺一個嘅情況底下誒冇辦法可以再經過多次投標、公開招標都揾唔，

287
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:23,090
到個營辦商嘅，我哋都要諗諗其他嘅方法嘅。不過，即係當然亦都有一個嘅從做法，就係話政府要出資去誒，即係營運啦，自己營運啦，或者係招標揾人去營運，而政府係去畀翻嗰個管理費。呢個亦都即係有其他嘅情況係有噉樣樣做。咁但係我哋相信，如果而家而家顧問嗰個假設咧，佢哋。

288
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,480
後咧，呢個DBO嘅形式咧，係一個可以嘗試嘅形式嚟嘅。

289
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,460
嗱，正話，嗯，顧問咧，亦都講講到咧，就話。

290
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,750
呢個政府大球場都係用唔同嘅形式嘅，但係都出現咗一啲唔同嘅問題。

291
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:04,720
政府，我相信你哋考慮過唔同嘅因素啊！你哋有冇考慮過自己去營運咧？

292
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:52,450
break啊course去去去去處理嘅，咁同埋你哋點樣去有你有冇一個標準，就話佢營運得好，營運得唔好？

293
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:22,230
好難揾到一個好嘅誒管理公司，因為裏邊牽涉嘅嘢係太多，不但止係一啲體育、一啲文娛、一啲社區或者其他嘅大型活動咧，都會響嗰度舉行嘅。

294
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:09,810
嗱，我覺得如果由初期由佢哋去設計，而跟住去運作咧，響將來佢哋嘅營運嗰度咧係好嘅，因為嗱，我睇到我哋香港有幾個例子，例如機場嘅展覽館啦，啊，依個遊輪碼頭啦，甚至到。

295
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:40,510
其實依六千萬嘅金額係咪有呢個必要咧？同埋係咪當應該點解唔考慮當投標真係冇標翻先至去做另外一個兩手準備咧？因為事實上即係呢一個係一個新嘢嚟嘅。誒，香港市民就覺得餵你無端端。

296
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:56,310
下一位啊，林建峯議員第二次嘅三分鐘。啊啊，多謝主席。誒，即係香港作為一個國際城市咧，係需要好多其他嘅配套嘅，包括我哋主要嗰啲配套啦。噉啊，翻依個管依個體育園咧，其實啊，我覺得最重要嘅咧就係點樣揾到一個管理。

297
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:42,520
咁誒可唔可以？你哋有冇考慮過？唔係用一個營運商，而係用幾個營運商去處理唔同嘅呢個整整個體育園嘅運作咧？咁誒嗱，管理公司咧，你而家係畀佢廿五年嘅。咁如果佢管理得唔好，噉你哋有冇一個？

298
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:37,040
噉你哋平衡咗過去嘅經驗嚇，咁會唔會最後都諗翻自己去管理咧嚇？我諗我畀翻啲時間誒政府或者顧問嗰度答一答啊。係係誒，秘書長。簡單答咗先，或者請顧問補充。所謂自己去管理咧，就不外。

299
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:57,050
乎兩個嘅方向啦。第一就係交翻畀康文署管理，用翻我哋誒一三二章遊樂場地契約或者係大球場嘅契誒條條款去管理。咁大家都明白喺呢一個嘅管理模式底下咧，係有一定嘅限制嘅，因為政府有政府嘅採購嘅政策，我哋只能夠跟翻一貫嘅價低者得。

300
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:17,060
嘅方法去畀到嗰個嘅合約，咁所以作為一個大咁大型嘅體育城、體育園咧，我哋覺得用翻政府傳統嗰種方式去營運咧係唔理想嘅。誒，因為佢哋當中亦都有商業嘅元素，亦都要希望能夠成為一個有活力嘅體育園。第二個方法就係話由政府即係由民政局去誒將所有嘅誒誒合約拆。

301
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:37,070
拆散誒，畀幾十個唔同嘅呢一個嘅管理嘅單位，譬如話誒誒設施管理一間公司，誒呢一個活動管理另外一間公司，但係大家都會諗得到，如果由我哋去管理幾十個呢啲嘅承辦商，個結果就係大家會好唔協調，亦都當中會有好多嘅爭拗，因為亦都最後都係翻。

302
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,720
project.

303
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,340
條問題。

304
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,760
發對主席。

305
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,720
secondly。

306
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,710
just responding to that question in two parts around the bid incentive.

307
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,670
Okay, so, okay, Dr Michael. Thank you, Chairman.

308
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:42,450
the first aspect is that the costs of the bid incentive would not be in addition to the project budget. It would be out of the project budget that has already been discussed in this forum. So it is not additional money.

309
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:43,400
誒，因為今朝就顧問公司都都有幾詳細嘅解釋，佢哋嗰個覺得係需要誒有一個所謂提案有因嘅。

310
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:57,080
翻到嚟民政局呢度要做仲裁，咁當中嗰個複雜性咧亦都係相當之高。所以點解我哋覺得，如果由一個單一嘅承辦商去做咧，係一個最理想。我覺得我哋應該畀呢個機會去試一試。雖然話喺香港唔係一個好常見嘅情況，但係作為一個咁誒噉嘅咁特別嘅project咧，咁大嘅項目咧，我哋覺得嘅經過顧問咁多年嘅研究。

311
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:22,330
好，就下一位誒，郭創城議員，第二次嘅三分鐘。多謝主席。主席，我諗其實社會各界咧都非常之關注咧，就係而家呢一個建議入邊提出，就係話政府畀落選者落選嘅投票者提供係六千萬呢一個嘅金額。其實我好想再一次問政府當。

312
00:48:40,790 --> 00:49:00,800
美樂標者六千萬，呢個其實説明咗會唔會係入邊有一啲嚇令到市民感覺到不安嘅情況咧？咁點我第一點要問，第二點我再想問政府當局咧，對於廿五年個營辦嘅問題，其實事實上我相信誒我自己都高度關注咧二十五年呢個期限嘅誒喺定嘅。

313
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:20,810
過程入邊頭先聽即係當局講就係話佢話喂，基於佢有唔同由設計建設到營運二十五年，其實呢個時間係咪可以再縮短咧？如果我哋縮短嘅，政府當局又遇到啲乜嘢困難係覺得縮短係唔可行咧？都係主席，啊，秘書長，或者我請我哋嘅顧問去回答呢兩。

314
00:49:48,190 --> 00:50:08,200
We believe through our analysis of the market and various other measures that without this incentive, there is a real risk of insufficient bidders, so two or potentially less bidders for this project, and that questions the viability of the entire tendering process. So we think it is a critical part of the success, a critical success factor for this.

315
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:29,900
係，誒，郭議員，有冇跟進？好，主席，我想期望咧，政府當局係咪可以再提供多少少資料畀我？頭先就聽佢哋講，佢哋話有一個分析啊嘛。如果個分析能夠係即係向立法會披露嘅話咧，更加讓即係公眾或者市民都感覺到呢一個係一個叫做可行嘅做法。

316
00:50:43,680 --> 00:51:03,690
理由，你係咪覺得嗰個今日畀啲資料仲唔夠，想要再進一步，依係點樣？我唔太清楚你想問嘅。主席，我想希望有關當局能夠再進一步提供咧，佢嗰個分析啦。今日佢嘅PPT咧就講咗一部分嘅啫。咁既然頭先你認為係真係透過呢個分析能夠更有信心地可以做到呢個投標嘅話咧。

317
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:23,700
我期望佢會後可以再披露更加多嘅資料。好啊，秘書長。誒，主席嗰個詳細頭先誒顧問講嗰啲嘅誒分析咧，我哋可以提供嘅。不過我想講一點咧，就係誒頭先啊啊安議員提到話啊，噉你不如可以試咗一次冇呢個投標有因，跟住翻嚟冇人投，或者得一個起。

318
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:43,710
兩個字，我哋再做過啦。咁咁當然呢個係一個可能嘅可能性嚟嘅。不過作為一個咁大嘅項目、國際關注嘅項目，如果我哋第一次做完呢一個嘅投標嘅程序係失敗嘅，噉我哋當然就要即係諗過係咪呢一個方式係最好啦。亦都誒要考慮，即係對於喺個國際聲譽上邊，即係。

319
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,810
誒。

320
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,210
skills together, single contract, and I think.

321
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:49,630
噉就至於頭先啊，我議員要求嘅誒誒文件就誒，秘書長會後去提供嚇，好。

322
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:17,060
嘅提升，你覺得如果我哋留一次標嘅話，會蝕嘅，可能要畀多幾多錢？嗱，兩個問題，各位主席。

323
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:52,550
Yes, the question with regard to the DBO. So DBO has been done in Hong Kong before. It is okay with with differences, but I think generally.

324
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:43,600
誒時間唔多，所以我想接咗下一個問題先。唔緊要，我我今日都即係寬鬆一啲，因為誒知道個問題，大家都有興趣。誒，Mr. Graham。

325
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:34,170
到誒第三四年、第五年嘅時間咧，嗰個支出先會係誒係大嘅。咁所以咧，呢一個誒乘以五個percent，呢個係一個即係誒基本上同誒誒都係一個差唔多一個數目嚟嘅。係明白。咁DPO嘅問題。O.K. 所以話。

326
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:42,270
係唯一一個或者兩個係入標嘅財團，噉佢哋自然就會用一啲好辣嘅條件，對我哋好不利嘅條件嚟入標，而佢又合乎最低嘅招要求嘅時候，我哋都要畀呢一個標書佢。咁所以我哋想避免呢種嘅情況咧，就係希望最少有四個嘅入標標書畀我哋考慮。好。

327
00:51:43,710 --> 00:52:03,720
我哋呢個嘅計劃做咗一次之後唔成功，同埋嗰個時間牽涉咧，再做一次投標咧，其實每一次都牽涉成十二至到十八個月嘅，即係我哋要等多十二至十八個月咧，先可以再做。咁可能最終我哋都係要用翻呢個提案有因呢個方法嚟到吸引啲人入標。我想強調一點咧，畀少少時間我咧就係點解我哋要有？

328
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:23,730
四個入標咧，就係因為我哋要足夠有足夠嘅競爭。其實坊間可能係會有一至到兩個嘅財團係願意入標嘅，但係我哋覺得得一至兩個咧，個競爭性真係唔夠大。如果佢哋知道誒，其實物市場嘅信息係即係好好好靈通嘅，佢哋可能都會知自己。

329
00:52:49,910 --> 00:53:09,920
就請阿何俊賢議員第一次嘅四分鐘，係誒都係主席。其實我想問兩個問題嘅，一個就係DBO，一個咧就係頭先誒馮秘處長頭先答嘅誒問題一啲深化嘅跟進。噉啊，第一個咧，我想問DBO咧，其實呢種模式喺香港一定係新啦。噉我你又頭先話誒覺得應該要。

330
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:29,930
試噉，但係試嘅話咧，其實亦都畀到香港市民呢啲信心。究竟喺其他嘅地方呢一種嘅模式，佢有冇成功過，或者係有冇啲數據？誒，或者係而家面對緊嘅問題係乜嘢？我希望你答一答。第二樣嘢咧，就係誒，我明白到嘅誒話，如果係。

331
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:49,940
用唔用六千萬去提供有因畀人投標嘅話，可能會導致流標，或者佢嘅競爭力低。噉我想你解釋兩個情況。第一，如果單標嘅話咧，其實我都我都諗到啦。如果單標嘅話咧，佢可能擺佢認為自己係唯一嘅投標者，佢只係會將自己標書。

332
00:53:49,940 --> 00:54:09,950
寫到啱啱到達政府嗰個要求嘅標準。如果你多幾個咧，就可能當然可以提升質素啦。咁但係，如果最差嘅情況係連一標都冇，一個都冇嘅話，我哋會損失十二至十八個月。當中嘅損失，根據過去幾年嘅通脹等等，或者係誒建築物料。

333
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:37,370
啊，秘書長。誒，或或者我請阿專員答咗第二條題目先，咁然後就誒請阿顧問答翻第一條，關於其他地區嗰個D B O嘅經驗。嗯，誒好啊，阿楊生。誒，主席，關於嗰個誒價格嗰度咧，如果即係簡單嚟講咧，如果係個項目推遲一年嘅話咧，咁起碼嗰個誒計翻個價格調整咧，個通脹。

334
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,720
主席。

335
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,730
盡快提供好嘛？好。

336
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,290
局長、副局長啊！

337
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:37,090
招標評分六成計劃書體重嘅承諾。

338
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,200
誒，跟住下一位咧，就係阿田北辰議員，係第二次嘅三分鐘。

339
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:20,600
要去交交啲資料過嚟，喺尤其是喺公務能夠交到交到啦。如果萬一真係，

340
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:32,410
嘅人嘅，你肯出錢就請到㗎啦，等於競選承諾，永遠咧都係美好嘅。

341
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:46,020
我而家話咧，想計劃書同埋建築成本都係包喺六成，就有三成咧，就一個包底數一成嘅分成。

342
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:07,550
咁如果到時又將包底嘅數定喺至少收入分成一半咧，對承辦水客商係雙重嘅底線，對政府工黨係雙重嘅保障。

343
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:57,240
將呢個包底數嘅重要性提高，咁所以我睇重嘅咧就係承擔主席，就唔係承諾啊，好大分別㗎。O K，邊個唔識承諾啊？

344
00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:05,820
六千萬入標有因換呢個落選標書嘅技術取長補短砌靚份計劃書咧，如果呢個計劃可以幫到我哋揾有料嘅大處咧，我啊真係冇乜所謂。

345
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:13,660
資料交過嚟咧，就係頭先佢話有啲地方都係誒成功嘅，咁可唔可以提供三幾個例子畀我哋睇睇？佢過去幾年嘅營運或者係收入，甚至係佢投標嘅過程同香港而家嘅DBO有冇啲具體唔同嘅地方？

346
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:57,380
個因素咧都起碼係誒百分之五左右。咁如果百分之五咧喺呢個項目嚟講咧誒三百多億乘以百分之五，大概係五億六六億左右啦。嗱，主席，我我想你再深化答唔答兩個問題？你唔會三百幾億，你第一年就用三百幾億㗎嘛？咁即係你啲市民講我誒？

347
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:17,390
可能第一年你只係用一百二百億去做一個基礎嘅建設投標開展，你之後先至繼續抌錢落去嘅。我想問下你，真係確實少少，唔好咁rough就用三百幾億，我就成落去百分之五啊。我想了解下個內容。多謝主席。我係楊生。主席誒，如果頭一兩年嚟講咧，呢啲項目咧，通常投前兩年比較少啲嘅。咁其實咧係誒去到。

348
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:14,100
infrastructure projects like this with using different models often combine different aspects of of different models in order to to achieve. But for us primarily, the aim was to identify the model which would achieve government's priorities in terms of transfer of risk, bringing the right.

349
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:38,500
It is, one could argue, for example, that, you know, a project such as Wembley, in the UK, which is at the end of the day, is a public sector financed project. And yes, there was commercial money came in, but yes, there was government money. It was design, build and is operated by the FA. So in that sense, it is a

350
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:58,510
successful DBO contract. Some of the Qatari stadiums have aspects of finalised design, build and operate within them as well. So I think the model is is tried and tested in many different infrastructures. I think on stadiums there are aspects of it which have been used. 啊，主席，噉我我想補充要佢有啲。

351
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:40,890
誒交唔到過，你財會都一定要畀我哋。噉啊，不唔係，秘書長係咪可以會後提交有關D B O喺誒其他地方成功嘅一啲例子，甚至乎有啲係誒如果有啲數字嚇統計嘅數字畀我哋知道得唔得咧？誒，主席係可以嘅嚇。我哋要在喺呢誒呢個星期內提供。

352
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:26,270
我最怕嘅咧就係納税人畀多三百億想食九大簋，個廚師咧最後咧就求其炒碟星洲炒米，貨不對板，噉啊唔通到時揾商品説明條例去告佢咩？係咪？商業世界從來咧就唔欠缺計劃書，寫到識飛嘅。

353
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:28,400
高。

354
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,940
Thank you.

355
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,340
你冇保底咧，佢梗係越長越好。

356
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,380
第二間咧，我可能逐個月我都會去。

357
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,760
我咧就係做零售嘅，噉啊，我係租客。

358
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:33,620
嗱，你自己諗下，我係話畀你聽，第一間啊，我可能兩年都唔去一次。

359
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:37,720
Thank you, Chairman. Just to answer that question in two parts, there's

360
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:02,740
好啦，噉你跟住嗰個二十十個方案，你就話長咗冇人制嚇實啲投標者。

361
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:47,570
你最後講嗰一句嘢咧，就係如果合約期內承辦商無心亂戰，可以畀保證金走呢樣嘢，我好大問題喎。

362
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:38,580
如果你有保底咧，佢未必要咁長。佢入錯咗標咧，佢輸足廿五年，所以唔好假設啊！你哋唔識做生意，可能最後後後邊嗰啲顧問，我哋投標做生意未必咁計嘅。

363
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:28,370
如果有兩間鋪，一間咧抽三成畀業主冇保底，另外一間咧抽一成畀業主五十萬，又叫保底。我想你估下，你估邊間鋪頭，我會存多啲咧？

364
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:55,860
咁所以咧，其實我覺得呢個保底係最緊要、最緊要。保底係講緊承擔，因為而家地由我哋出錢，由我哋出。佢話出設計啫，咁到時點啊？設計完咗之後，佢發覺唔對路嘅，佢有咩壓力去做好佢咧？

365
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:23,110
噉你而家出曬地、出曬錢，成個直升機家長咁款，承辦商就成個温室小花都唔使照顧得咁周到啊。如果你有一個三成嘅保底主席，承辦商分分鐘啊問你可唔可以短啲，因為佢都要平衡風險㗎嘛，佢未必甩到身嘅，所以。

366
01:00:47,850 --> 01:01:07,860
而家佢出誒計劃書誒，佢出呢個設計，我哋出錢起。如果到時個設計唔掂，佢放棄廿五年可能做咗五年甩身，畀保證金，我哋咪大鑊。咁下一個嚟嘅話，佢啲設計唔啱，完全冇法子嘅，我哋咪企喺度。田北辰議員，你問問題都已經。

367
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:27,870
已經超過三分鐘。誒，同埋咧，今日誒並冇局長或者副局長在職。對唔住，噉我話寬鬆少處理啦。不如我讓誒常備啊，馮靜淑女士答答答你嘅問題，好嗎？啊，誒，我請我哋嘅顧問去就住商業嘅一啲嘅計算去答一答。我成日覺得常備好似副局長。嗯，所以啊，Mr.

368
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:58,010
There will be a performance bond in place during the operating period of material volume to keep them honest to make sure they don't just walk away. So that's one aspect. In terms of the money side of things and the revenue share or rental arrangements. Yeah, how much is that compared to thirty billion? We spend thirty billion.

369
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:20,940
and.

370
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,630
要揾塊地出嚟，要再去做BOT。

371
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,870
The operating period guarantee needs to be significant.

372
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:29,370
so that they cannot just walk away, but it needs to be relevant to the operating.

373
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:02,400
Building this thing, how much is the performance bond? Yes, 10 billion.

374
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:47,740
fixed rental amount plus a share of revenue to balance those two those two factors.

375
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,040
The tricky thing here is that the size of the investment by the government.

376
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:19,380
versus the requirement of an operating guarantee during the operating period.

377
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:55,900
我的點是minimum guarantee every year。如果你有minimum guarantee，what would be their incentive to have a long lease?

378
01:03:49,920 --> 01:04:00,380
One here, it has to be sufficient to make it difficult for them to just give the keys back and walk away without any doubt at all. The size of that is still something which is under discussion.

379
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:07,800
Wouldn't they want to get out sooner? Okay, Michael, I would allow me to answer this question as well, please. Yeah, Alastair. Graham, I think the you know.

380
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:13,960
But without doubt, you're right. It has to be sufficient to keep them. It has to be sufficient. Okay, thank you. Ah, 雲裕，你啲時間過咗好多好多啦，哈，雙倍都唔止啦。哈，跟住到啊楊嶽橋議員係第二次啊，三分鐘。主席，我。

381
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:23,330
So, Michael, please. I'll continue with the first aspect, and then we can come back to that. So, in terms of the the rental arrangement, you know, we we acknowledge the point about having a fixed rental incentivising them to work hard to get over that that that cost, if you like. At the same time, we also acknowledge we've looked at this in detail.

382
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:43,340
We we feel that in the initial years of the project, it may present a challenge because it is an additional cost of doing business as they are developing their business. That said, we recognise that it also incentivises them and is beneficial in the long term. So what we are looking at is an approach that is twofold that has a fixed rental amount or a response that involves a.

383
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:49,920
period which may or may not be relevant to the size of the investment. These are social infrastructure investments, so you know there is no, they're not investment class assets on which one can have a have a return on investment. So you know the size of the guarantee we are we are on one.

384
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:34,400
諗翻咧，就係當日喺我哋處理西九嘅時候咧，我哋推翻個天幕設計個詞，跟住進而衍生嘅就係今日有西九管理局，跟住而家亦都見到咧，係西九管理局喺當日一次過絕獲注資之後，而家唔夠錢咁需要。

385
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,210
多謝主席。

386
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,710
請局方回應一下先，主席。

387
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:04,770
係，或者請阿主席。我諗由誒二零一。

388
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:35,360
下先啦，冇冇喺度。劉國君，月冇錯，第二次係兩分鐘。

389
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:07,430
喺西九個經驗咧，就係我哋上次獲注資之後咧，係唔夠錢嘅。

390
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:29,260
好，就到下一位啦。誒，劉國芬議員咧係第。

391
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:21,380
八十幾億咧係嗰個嘅所謂價格嘅調整，當中亦都有十一億咧係嗰個嘅誒應急嘅費用。咁所以點解個數去到三百幾億就係咁解？我哋都相對相當有信心咧，係呢一個數係足夠我哋去完成呢個項目嘅。

392
01:05:45,070 --> 01:06:00,820
一個蓬勃嘅活力嘅充沛嘅體育員咧，係基本上係達唔到嘅。咁所以，我哋先至用DBO呢個形式嚇。我哋唔覺得呢個嘅體育員係需要成立一個法定嘅機構嚟到去處理佢嘅問題。好啦，主席，阿楊議員繼續。

393
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:58,010
誒，我想問一問咧，就係究竟局方有冇諗過，即係西九管理局呢個模式嘅吸取係咪吸取到啲教訓，所以先至有今次嘅呢個處理辦法咧？定係局方認為西九管理局其實呢一種模式係值得考慮嘅？咁但係今次冇考慮。我想先喺呢一點而言。

394
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:25,060
二年，我哋開始去考慮嗰個嘅採購模式、誒營運模式咧。誒，我哋係冇考慮過成立一個嘅法定機構嚟到管理啟篤園嘅，因為我哋覺得當中三項嘅設施其實相對於西九會係簡單一啲啦。佢三項設施當中有兩項都係社區嘅設施嚟嘅，噉我哋覺得由翻政府去擁有。

395
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:45,070
呢一個設施咧係誒有比較大嘅誒控制同埋係嗰個嘅誒話語權咧係比較適合嘅。咁但係當然實實際去營運嘅時候咧，我哋就唔想由政府用一啲我哋政府嘅方式去營運，因為大家都睇到政府方式營運係有佢嘅限制，亦都有佢係作為要發展一

396
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:27,720
咁今次我想請教下局方有乜嘢信心，覺得呢三百幾億係足夠，而唔會再需要翻嚟立法會去再攞撥款咧？主席誒，秘書長係主席。其實咧，今次呢個真係一個傳統嘅公務工程啦。嚇，所有嘅誒投標嘅條款係由政府去擬定，咁亦都。

397
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:47,730
其實所去計算呢一個嘅三百一十九億咧，我哋亦都係經過十幾個月嘅，由我哋嘅技術顧問咧去做咗好多嘅工作。誒，有好多嘅誒，亦都有呢個QS，即係我哋嘅測量嘅顧問去幫我哋去測vet過曬成條數。睇翻我哋而家嗰個嘅提交個建議咧，三百一十九億裏邊咧，實際我哋估計喺二零一六。

398
01:06:47,730 --> 01:07:07,740
年四誒九月嗰個價格其實係二百三十八億嘅啫，但係因為誒我哋唔知道幾時攞到撥款啦，亦都唔知道真係實際興建完嗰個日期係咪如我哋所料係二零嘅二啦，咁所以我哋一定要擺一個嘅叫做price adjustment嘅數喺裏邊，呢一個咧就會係八十一億，即係我哋而家嘅數裏邊三百十九億裏邊有。

399
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,040
對唔對？

400
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,330
兩次。

401
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,630
係，所以係。

402
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:46,000
非常之少啦，咁一個慘淡嘅經驗，我明白大家都唔想再見得到嘅，咁但係。

403
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:34,520
要我哋即係聽咗意見之後嘅改動嚟嘅。好，下一位啊，張超雄議員第三次嘅兩分鐘。

404
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:34,990
啦，佢總會就唔係當初設計者或者係興建者嘅，噉佢都要去適當地或者適合翻去用呢個場地嘅設施嘅，咁所以我關鍵就係。

405
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:46,740
目標嘅程序啦嘛，咁如果佢話喂有啲嘢你可能要誒與時並進，你要改善嘅，咁政府亦都要投入呢一個嘅資源，係去去改善嗰度嘅設施嘅，咁唔係一定係話誒做開嗰個就永遠都係由嗰個嚟到去去去做嘅。

406
01:08:46,280 --> 01:09:01,530
如果一個嘅計劃我自己睇落去咧，即係咁正啦，地點又好啦，咁誒理論上應該係有得做嘅。咁如果你話喂，因為要配合翻個設計，因為營運者係需要個設計咧係一致嘅話咧。

407
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:53,040
究竟個設計係咪諮詢好即係體育嘅業界，係令到佢哋都覺得係啱佢哋去使用，亦都有得佢做。咁並非話喂設計同營運一定要即係一間做曬嘅。噉我想希望即係啊常表可以打一打。嚇，秘書長。

408
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:58,860
今次咧就即係當然即係誒顧問公司誒對唔住喺第你係第三次兩分鐘嚇，你講啦，係咪畀翻啲時間？係得得，你係開始啦嚇。好，多謝主席。噉啊，今次咧其實上一次大家都追問嗰個提案有因啦，今次就其實顧問公司都解釋得即係比之前多啦。咁但係呢一個老實咁講。

409
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:18,870
即係我都擔心，其實係咪紙上談兵？即係嗰啲目標效果係咪真係能夠做得到咧？呢一個即係會唔會頭先有同事都講，即係真係試咗一次拎佢出去投標嘅時候冇人嘅時候咧，噉我哋再行呢個模式會唔會好啲咧？第二樣嘢咧就係關於嗰個即係。

410
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:39,360
誒設計啦，啊，跟住營運啦，咁呢一樣嘢咧。嗱，當然我亦都明白到，即係可能誒嗰最近嗰個遊輪碼頭嘅經驗就話到畀我聽，因為即係營運者話：喂，個設計唔係好啱佢用。咁所以你見得到而家遊輪碼頭真係即係可能誒人流係非常。

411
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:21,820
咁其實我有個迷思喺度嘅，就係咧，噉係咪代表要即係永續畀佢用咧？因為如果你唔係永續畀一個即係中咗間公司去做嘅話咧，總會有一日，無論政府接手又好啦，第二間公司接手又好啦，或者將來第三、第四間公司接手都好。

412
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:13,330
係誒，主席，我哋而家建議呢個咧，就當然喺投呢個階段，尤其是誒早期一個比較唔穩定嘅，需要好多唔同團體去磨合嘅時候，我哋係希望由一個嘅承辦商裏邊有唔同嘅經驗嘅人去運營運，因為呢段時間係最緊要嘅，你要建立嗰個地方嘅品牌，你要建吸引活動，要。

413
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:33,340
要大家之間係去磨合好噉，所以咧即係點咧？我哋要建議就係一個D B O嘅形式。但係你講緊譬如二十五年、十或三十五年之後，我哋再要做一個投標嘅時候，嗰個嘅誒營運者入到場嘅時候，佢話：喂，你誒三十五年前起嘅嘢唔係好適合咯。咁到時我諗我哋都要去調教嘅，即係你係一個新嘅投。

414
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,140
係乜嘢？

415
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,900
你。

416
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:02,110
你完全冇量度，冇提。

417
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,900
我哋話要掉幾百億出嚟，咁梗係好多。

418
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:07,800
噉啊，當然啦，即係幾百億嘅計劃，咁呢個肥豬肉。

419
01:12:55,830 --> 01:13:01,920
唔係得KPMG做你哋嘅顧問嘅，原來總共我數都有廿六間顧問公司。

420
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,440
所謂營造一個綜合性有活力、功能性高嘅園區嘅機會。

421
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:17,080
噉啊，即係我哋特區政府嘅羊羔嚟嘅，不過最慘、最大嘅羊羔咧，就係我哋香港市民，因為啲錢咧係市民嘅。

422
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:25,090
點樣普及化個體育員點樣畀基層市民享用到啊？張燕，你個問題提出咗啦，其實時間都過咗，不過阿阿秘書長。

423
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:15,160
乜嘢咩原則？今日嗰啲全部冇嘅喎。你嗰啲體育政策嘅KPI去咗邊？我上次問過㗎啦，我叫佢今次提交啦，去曬邊啊？

424
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:37,630
誒佢嘅問題係嗰啲資料，佢想問嗰K P I嗰啲哦K P I頭先上次誒議員提出嗰啲嘅誒資料咧，我哋暫時係未做得到畀大家，因為得兩日嘅時間嚇。

425
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:15,350
誒，阿張超雄議員係第三次兩分鐘。係主席，誒，今日我哋聽完啲顧問嚟到講咧，其實咁複雜嘅PowerPoint咧，得一句嘅簡單説話就係政府咩都唔識做。

426
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:31,360
即係我哋由設計、建興建以至營運咧，即係如果顧問公司個講法就係，其實如果唔用一啲私營嘅營運者，咁根本我哋冇辦法咧。

427
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:55,550
咁呢個真係誒，我唔知道政府係咪真係咩都唔識，不過睇嚟真係啊！佢都係畀啲顧問牽住鼻子走。我我上翻你哋個網頁咧，呢個啟德誒體育園個網頁咧，我發覺原來。

428
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:58,710
噉你話我哋有體育政策嘅咪普及化、精英化、城市化？咁但係我睇曬所有文件，包括今日新提交嘅文件咧，係完全冇就住呢啲體育政策點樣樣讓呢個體育員咧彰顯到佢目的㗎喎。

429
01:10:47,650 --> 01:11:07,660
咁誒，另外就諮詢業界嗰度啦。誒，我哋其實呢個嘅項目咧，喺過去呢幾年裏邊咧，係不斷噉樣諮詢業界。我哋自己喺體育委員會下邊有一個嘅誒工作小組，係有誒各個體育總會嘅代表喺裏邊，足球啊、籃球啊、誒冰氈啊、羽毛球等等。其實點解其中有一個建議，我哋嗰

430
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:27,670
個嘅室內運動場係由最初我哋嘅四千人係加到而家一萬人咧，正正就係聽咗體育總會佢哋嘅意見，佢哋認為你如果係起一個室內嘅場，起得四千位根本就滿足唔到佢哋搞大賽嘅需要，咁所以點樣我哋喺有限嘅用地底下咧，我哋都將呢個運動場係擴大到一萬個座位，係一個最重。

431
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:59,270
係二次問先嘅，定係還是舉手去到第五次都？誒，你都係第我係我係以問得少次數嗰呢排先嘅會。係啊，我我想問，我問咗。你係你又問咗兩次啦，所以你都同樣係第三次。冇得問咗兩次，但係你係排喺張超雄同阿何君耀之後嘅。我由我問咗一次喎，上次誒，我哋記錄好清楚，你問咗。

432
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:41,220
即係海納啊，豺狼喺出邊hold住啦。咁然後就整個噉嘅計劃出嚟，就係總之所有嘢你交畀啲誒私人公司咧，就先至會有達到你嘅目的。不過好奇怪嘅，如果從政府嘅角度，我理論上應該去考慮緊你根本個體育嘅政策。

433
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,990
呢方面嘅文件，好嘛？好。

434
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,820
跟住下一位，阿何君瑤議員第三次嘅兩分鐘。

435
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:11,100
嘅，我哋一個對比參照，噉我哋會明白多啲咁多。唔該，誒，秘書長。

436
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:59,760
體育員點樣令到我哋體現到體育政策嘅目標啊？我哋呢個工具嚟嘅啫嘛。

437
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:51,400
誒會幾時？誒嗱，如果講緊個體育員呢個項目嘅KPI係畀咗嘅，喺誒之前會議之前係畀咗嘅啦。但係我聽到張議人誒張超雄議員個意思係話，你要體育政策嘅KPI係嘛？

438
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:45,550
營運裏邊，營運亦都會有嗰個誒賺與蝕嘅風險。咁呢一度又點樣transfer過去咧？噉我好想睇呢幾個方案嘅就建築期誒design and build嗰度嘅風險嘅點樣攤分同埋轉讓。

439
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:30,280
誒誒嗰個嘅資料咧，我哋可以提供嘅，即係詳細啲點樣誒D B O嘅形式係點樣將風險轉移畀承辦商，無論喺建築期抑或係營運期，呢個我哋可以再詳細啲講。其實喺以往嘅文件都畀過嘅，不過我諗我哋綜合再再講一次。好啊，噉啊，提供呢方面嘅文件嚇。

440
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:20,300
因為上次啊張，我我解釋下，因為上次張超雄議員咧，我記得佢講咧，就係因為你有體育政策，係嘛，即係點樣精英精英化、普及化、城市化，咁所以喺個體育園區誒呢個整個合約裏邊咧，我相信你都係即係我哋都期望咧，營運者咧係能夠誒通通過。

441
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:40,310
嘅營運咧係達到呢啲目標噉，因此咧係咪會有相應嘅KPI畀佢咧？噉係問呢個呢啲問題。係多謝理解係正確啊嘛啱嘅，啱嘅。我記得你講過咩嘢㗎？所以誒喺呢方面係咪秘書長咪可以提交到噉嘅資料？嗱，就住體育員點樣去達到嗰個嘅體育政策KPI，我哋可以再演譯嘅。但係KPI係畀咗嘅，但係每一項K

442
01:15:40,310 --> 01:16:00,320
KPI畀呢個營辦商嘅KPI點樣符合翻我哋三大體育政策呢一個嘅即係下一集喺度，我哋就可以喺呢個會後去提供翻。我對唔住，呢個呢個係我哋整個政策嘅目標啊嘛。好啊，你淨係講工具，你唔係叫做一個out要求啦。我亦都誒請誒秘書長即係盡快提供啊呢。

443
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:28,520
多謝主席。誒，今日好高興咧，就聽到營運顧問咧，就同我哋解釋，就話講喺PowerPoint裏邊啊，第七版、第六、第五版嗰度咧，有九個方案經過即係比較，所謂叫做利與弊之後，認為咧現時嘅嗰個B D B O作為一個基本方案。咁喺誒。

444
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:48,530
PowerPoint裏邊誒，亦都有講到，即係第二、第三、第四、第五嘅嗰方案咧，相對咧嗰個風險好高啊，同埋第五個方案，尤其是咧就話將所有嘅risk咧，全部都會轉嫁畀呢一個政府。喺噉嘅情況，總總綜合而言咧，就最靚嗰個方案就係第一個方案，就而家。

445
01:16:48,530 --> 01:17:08,540
叫做誒基本方案就係DBO嗱誒，我唔係好清楚，因為淨係純粹一個PowerPoint解釋過我聽話個risk係係有transfer一個majority risk畀咗畀咗個consortium，所以我哋就會甩甩咗身噉。但係可唔可以提供個詳細嘅分析畀我睇？

446
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:42,310
話事權將標係畀邊個？我想你即係第日話埋呢樣嘢畀我哋啫。

447
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:55,740
假設第日真係，如果我哋唔搦呢一億八千萬出嚟，真係得一個兩個標，除咗你講個問題。

448
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:39,950
誒用即係紙，即係用書面答我，因為我相信下次我哋仲有問題都提出咗㗎啦。嚇，好好，啊，李處長。

449
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:52,510
噉啊，啊秘書長，因為頭先啊張張人誒議員問都有好多問題，或者喺喺你你誒補充嘅文件裏邊係咪可以答得到曬？

450
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:50,920
年咧，大家都有個意見，即係當然我開頭一聽二十五年，我就冇知道係連埋建築嘅年份喺度。咁即係如果你話啊建築係五年，咁其實我哋畀佢營運係二十年同二十五年就差啲嘅啦。

451
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:47,480
問題誒係新嘅，噉你都解釋咗，但係始終咧我都唔想綁你啦，就係假如第日得一個標嚟，你正話已經噏咗，就話好可能嗰啲條款會好苛刻嚟，得佢一個一個因嚟條標，咁但係。

452
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:17,350
即係三個可不可否決嘅時候咧，呢個我哋都會繼續同中央投標委員會去討論。但係如果只係得一個或者兩個咧，呢個標嘅誒應該就當係唔成功㗎啦。咁所以我哋就會又要再由頭嚟過做過。咁所以三係起碼，四係理想，呢個係我哋嘅睇法。

453
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:28,550
喺嗰個所謂而家嘅誒喺個建築期裏邊嗰三百一十八億，我哋預留埋個價格嘅嗰個應變等等喺裏邊，究竟呢啲係咪我哋即係轉曬過去？而家我哋使呢條數，我哋就冇實際上呢度亦都冇慳錢嘅空間呢？係第一，第二將來個。

454
01:17:45,880 --> 01:18:05,890
第二operation嗰度又點樣嗱？好多謝政府，亦都喺五月四號提供嘅文件裏邊咧，係就基本方案就係呢個噉嘅design build and operate嗰度咧，就畀咗五年方案。我哋睇睇到就好似話有有二億九千誒一百萬賺喺呢個二零誒二六年噉。但係同樣，我期望咧喺其他方案裏邊都畀翻個噉。

455
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:50,770
下位係張雨仁議員，嚇第三次兩分鐘。嗯，主席，我儘快啦，因為真係事實上好多嘢要問㗎嘛。好多謝，即係顧問公司，我諗政府係啱嘅，叫政誒顧問公司出嚟解釋下個背後。不過當然，今日佢嘅解釋嗰幾分鐘，嗰幾廿分鐘啦，都未必答到我哋所有同事嘅。

456
01:18:50,770 --> 01:19:10,780
誒其實擔心，正話韓君彌問嗰個，亦都我開頭想問嘅。因為其實你英文同中文都有啲分別，就係英文咧就淨講operating risk，你transfer all majority有個operating risk，但係你中文咧就講到好似所有風險都畀曬佢噉。因為我亦都好難相信咧，開頭我淨係鬧一鬧。

457
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:30,790
立到中文就係喂，我哋搦咗三百幾億出嚟，佢就咩風險咧？咁噉，所以咧，始終我都想嗱，同你講講，即係大家今次同時，包括誒我啊自由黨，我都有啲誒睇法，就係其實誒呢一個誒一億八千萬嗰個嘅。

458
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:16,030
我哋係咪要重新招標咧？去到乜嘢嘢，我哋要重新招標嗱。你講十二到十八個月嘅重新招標，影響我哋個國際城市嘅相遇之外，但其實仲有錢嘅問題喺度㗎，仲有即係市民可以享用呢啲嘅建設嗰啲嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅嗯。

459
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:36,040
民娛康樂嘅活動，咁呢啲其實可唔可以擺得到有個錢喺度咧？即係多得曬喺度，等我哋都可以明白你搦個一億八千萬，希望多幾個人嘅投標係去到對我哋政府或者納税人有啲咩嘅著數咧？咁咁咧，你嗰個二十五。

460
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,260
即係我誒投標人。

461
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,060
梗係同你使盡佢啦！

462
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,430
今次成個招標咧。

463
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,900
呢啲係乜嘢嘅招標啊？

464
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:30,910
係人都知道，開咗張期票啦。

465
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:24,410
二百幾億，而家變咗三百十八億。

466
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:14,190
嘥我哋三百幾億珍貴嘅土地。

467
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,910
實質上有酒店，有餐飲。

468
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:48,090
即係我見過好多政府一啲咧係巧立名目嘅嘢。

469
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,360
西九又好，即係你都係知㗎啦，阿馮太。

470
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:30,060
仲要咧係慌死佢哋咧，要蝕本攞埋一億八千萬賠畀嗰啲顧問。

471
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,820
又係一次重演一啲政府咧，係倒香港人米嘅做法嚟。

472
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:39,140
最離譜嘅就係將來呢一個體育園區咧，如果你睇個發展咧，體育就為命。

473
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:10,360
運行咗三四年、四五年之後，得五十個活動喺個主場館。

474
01:23:53,640 --> 01:24:02,340
咁多嘅一啲嘅事件，錢納税人使曬出嚟，實質上嘅嘢咧就攞得係極少。譬如我舉個例，今次為例。

475
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:27,680
將來佢係賺眼嘅呢一個，因為三百幾億，即係如果我做我都諗到啦。你賠咗三百一十八億，有八十幾億叫做備用。

476
01:20:51,200 --> 01:21:11,210
咁但係始終我哋會錯㗎嘛？你政府會錯，個投標者會錯，錯咗我哋咪想佢劈炮咧噉。其實會唔會都可以同佢講，我哋嗰個營運二十年噉，不過我哋十年就要同你review。可能你達唔到標，我畀啲好啲嘅機會你，或者你達到標，我畀你。但係有一樣嘢，我真係想。

477
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:31,220
問你嘅，我就聽嚟聽去都聽唔到。你哋話呢個D B O咧，嗰個中標者係有up分money嘅，要我就唔知道個up分money係乜係幾多錢。即係除咗佢要畀個按金你之餘，仲有咩up分money佢需要嗱？你今日唔好答我，因為我過曬時間。誒，我我都希望你可以即係。

478
01:21:40,230 --> 01:22:00,240
可可以答哦，好誒誒嗱，我哋一般嚟講咧，誒政府嘅投標咧都需要一四個標書咧，係一個比較一般嘅做法。咁所以點解我哋話有一個中標三個落選，所以我哋嚟財委會係攞誒最多一千一億八千萬，但係咧喺呢個咁複雜嘅標書嚟講咧，我哋內部都傾過，如果係。

479
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,480
第二。

480
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,250
體育係咪最重要嘅？

481
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,590
就保護咗將來嗰啲投標嗰啲人士。

482
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,790
老實實，如果要做好體育嘅。

483
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,940
如果政府係要做一個體育政策嘅，

484
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:09,480
唔應該係用呢一種嘅咩所謂？

485
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,210
關人個關啦，一簽簽廿五年啦。

486
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:14,470
設計、建造、營運呢一個已經係註定係失敗嘅一個做法去做。

487
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:40,120
將來咧就揾錢係最緊要嘅，因為揾咗啊叫對分啦噉樣。

488
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:23,760
就應該將成個體育園區係原原本本去畀體育嘅活動去做。

489
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:29,280
之後先翻轉頭嘅政府喺呢件事入邊，完全係敷衍失責。點解最初同而家爭咁遠？

490
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:43,710
搞一場麥當娜演唱會好剩，同你搞個體育活動冇乜錢收，係人都知道，梗係搞體育活誒體搞嗰個演唱會啦。

491
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:34,730
你做酒店做餐飲冇問題，你判出去做餐飲同埋酒店，因為否則嘅話出嚟係咩後果咧？就係嗰啲個中標嗰啲人，我睇錢啦。

492
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:58,310
係人都知道揾錢係最緊要。點解政府要我哋大嗱嗱？你三百幾億打埋本畀人哋做生意，到時啲人係啲錢係賺錢至上嘅。呢個咩嘢體育政策？你攞曬啲體育活動啲人出嚟過橋。

493
01:24:46,810 --> 01:25:02,690
廿五年之後都賺夠啦，起又賺你一筆，營運又賺你一筆，餐飲又賺你一筆，賺咗你廿五年，你嗰陣時唔畀我做有乜所謂啦？體育嗰個政策做唔做有乜所謂啊？都已經係明日黃花嚟。

494
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:37,660
誒，主席，我我補充嘅好快速，因為我正話問下一個問題。其實喺呢個成個過程裏邊，無論邊個中標，即係去到第二日operation，你哋都有個小組去跟進啦，或者一個委員會。其實喺成個過程裏邊，佢中咗標，用佢嘅design出標書，係咪政府你哋都有全權？

495
01:22:52,940 --> 01:23:12,950
哦，好，誒，全權嘅我哋成個即係後邊程序都係政府民政事務局負責嘅。O.K. 好，郭家麒議員第一次嘅四分鐘，主席，我開宗明義講咧，我係誒支持體育活動，亦都支持咧係誒我哋有一個體育園區，但就係一定唔係呢一種嘅方法。

496
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:22,370
賺足廿五年，使我哋幾多已經超過一億嗰啲顧問費，而家都賺都唔夠，仲要再攞錢，係冇可能接受呢一啲噉嘅做法。我哋唔係唔支持體育活動，講得好清楚，但係呢個係掛羊頭賣狗肉，同埋最慘係畀咗三百幾億之後咧，我哋冇得翻轉頭，要二十五年。

497
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:36,860
係。

498
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,270
畀佢答。誒，秘書長。

499
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,210
係咪啊？係咪利潤至上啊？

500
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,950
誒，你嘅意見都表達咗㗎啦，噉啊，唔係我要佢答㗎。

501
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:36,220
誒，點樣？我唔係好明白最初嘅意思係。

502
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:41,540
係可以開中名義同大家講，係兩邊嘅訴求，我哋都要滿足嘅。

503
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:42,410
即係而家納税人，而家係三百幾億一樣。第二就係嗰個成個體育活動。

504
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:49,660
你唔好呃佢哋啦。咩體育活動咧？最初將將來整咗出嚟係利潤至上㗎嘛？

505
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:56,510
個價錢嘅意思係嘛？你好多樣嘢嘅，你咪我數曬出嚟啊！聽講嗰個價錢啊，嚇價錢，價錢。頭先我哋所講咧，就係話誒，而家其實以二零一六年九月嗰個價格係二百三十八億，比起最初我哋二零一五年嚟講嘅時候嗰個價格咧，係其實係少咗嘅，只係因為加咗嗰個價格調整八十幾億同埋。

506
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:16,520
係嗰個應急費用嗰度咧，所以先至去到三百一十九億。咁當然呢個最終係咪三百一十九億，亦都要經過投標嘅程序，睇下佢喺個競爭。你投咩標啊？你已經開曬三百幾億，要係財委會已經撥咗錢，你叫你後邊幫手嗰啲人，佢點樣去計數啊？有冇人噉樣投標法？政府點解啲工程三百幾億嘅公帑可以咁嘥？

507
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:36,530
誒，秘書長誒冇辦法㗎，因為我哋嚟財委會攞錢，我哋已經有一個實數，有一個估算，就係三百十九億噉。所以呢個係市場係知道嘅一一向嘅公共工程都係噉樣樣㗎啦。我哋嚟攞錢個數額係市場係會知道嘅。市場咪食曬你咯。我問你有點解會咁做，你個思維去點樣？點解呃？

508
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:17,240
誒，你嘅具體問題係乜嘢？你問係咪女人至上係嘛？啊，請阿秘書長。誒，主席，我哋成日都強調咧，呢一個園區有三大嘅設施，其中兩個呢一個嘅室內體育場同埋呢一個嘅誒運動場咧，係以一個嘅誒公共體育設施嘅形式嚟到營運嘅。至於五萬人嘅主場館咧，其

509
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:37,250
其實都係會大部有大部分嘅時間咧，係畀體育嘅活動係去進行嘅，而有少部分嘅三成裏邊有大概一小嘅一半咧，係一啲非體育嘅活動。咁呢個其實主要就係希望能夠滿足到既滿足到體育界嘅需求，亦都滿足到咧我哋有另外一啲嘅持份者，包括一啲娛樂界，佢哋希望能喺度搞到一啲娛樂活動。呢個我哋。

510
01:28:42,100 --> 01:29:02,110
各位委員，我今朝處理嗰個誒答問時間都係比較寬鬆嘅。咁不過咧，都係提醒大家咧，儘量即係掌握好誒你嗰個即係提問發言時間，你都預留時間畀誒官員咧回答，好嘛？就何俊賢議員第二次嘅三分鐘，係誒多謝主席。其實我係想預留啲時間咧。

511
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:22,120
畀官員回應翻郭議員頭先嘅提問嘅就係咧誒頭先佢問你係咪利潤利潤至上，或者係畀埋錢人哋走去搞演唱會去牟利咁？第一我我我據我睇文件啊，睇文件嘅話咧，其實政府係當中第一係有分成啦。咁主要賺錢，政府有錢分啦。第二樣嘢咧就係對於點樣評？

512
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:42,130
平衡真係實現到體育政策嘅目標，就係讓市民能夠得益啊嘛，或者係推動體育事業嘅發展。其實我睇文件咧，即係或者同官員啲溝通咧，係個主場館係需要每年做十場嘅本地波，或者係其他嘅一啲活動。我想你即係用呢個時間話畀市民知道一啲相對經。

513
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,390
郭偉強議員第一次嘅四分鐘。

514
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:47,390
你哋會採取啲乜嘢行動，同埋點樣監管同埋增加佢嘅透明度？

515
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:36,270
咧有啲類似嘅情況嘅，佢由於建造費都貴嘅，即係成三百億。

516
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:53,670
嗱，例如我哋可唔可以佢做唔到嘅話，我哋即刻終止佢係合約，而呢個程序複唔複雜？

517
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:29,630
於佢哋普及化同埋係精英化嗰個咧，係有一個好大嘅幫助。係主席，嗱，我想問啦，如果

518
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:41,680
營運商係不能夠滿足我哋政府或者我哋議員喺今次嗰財委會又好公務小會總之成個項目過咗之後，呢啲要求佢達唔到。

519
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:47,170
政府咧係可以終止個合約嘅。咁另外，頭先亦都講過啦，如嗰個日後嘅中標者咧係要畀一個保證金。咁咧，如果佢個表現係唔達標，而係要終止合約嘅話咧，個保證金咧亦都係政府會沒收嘅。

520
01:29:42,130 --> 01:30:02,140
經濟價值冇咁高，唔係唔賺錢。經濟價值冇咁高嘅，例如好似康文，你要用康文署嘅價錢去租場畀市民去用，等等嘅一啲措施，點樣推動到政策嘅發展？嗱，我畀多啲時間你去答。多謝主席，畀署長係誒嗱。呢一個成個體育園咧，我哋堅持一樣嘢咧，就係話做到時嘅收費係。

521
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:22,150
需要同康文署或者係有關嘅公營機構接近嘅，所以我哋係雖然係呢兩個場地嗰個室內體育館同埋嗰個嘅誒誒運動場咧，係肯定咧喺如果作為即係純粹體育活動咧，我哋係唔賺錢嘅。當年營辦商亦都唔能夠喺嗰度賺到錢，而係要透過其他嘅收入咧嚟到去補貼。

522
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:42,160
呢一方面嘅營運費用，我哋喺啱啱提交畀誒立法會嘅文件咧，誒回應胡志偉議員提咧，就話如果呢個場地係要用政府公堂去營運嘅時候，嗰個嘅洗費係幾多咧？我哋都畀咗一個數嘅。如果二十年間咧，係估計係大概九十二億到，即係話我哋除咗要投資喺三百一十九億咧，我哋仲要投資喺九十二億係。

523
01:30:42,160 --> 01:31:02,170
嗰個營運嘅費用噉，所以咧，我哋希望今次就係頭先所講話點樣將風險係轉移咧，就係話將誒透過一個嘅用零售同埋活動嘅方式嚟到去將嗰個嘅收入嚟到資助補貼翻佢去營運大量嘅公共嘅體育設施，市民可以用到室內嘅體育場。

524
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:22,180
館去打羽毛球，去做用翻而家康文署嘅收收費嚟到去做體育場館嗰個運動場，亦都可以畀到學界去做運動會同埋係做訓練。咁所以呢啲絕對咧都係幫到我哋香港嗰個體育嘅發展。誒，我哋嘅體育界嘅對呢方面嘅訴求係好大嘅，佢哋不斷咁希望政府快啲能夠起到呢一個嘅體育園區，就係對於。

525
01:31:53,950 --> 01:32:13,960
而且再唔係再加多一個，就係喺中間。如果當然啦，喺營運嘅時候出現咗問題，你嘅支援係點樣？會唔會拖住？誒得啦，繼續啦，捱埋呢二十五年佢啦噉樣。嗱，呢個係我哋市民可能會想問嘅。多謝。請阿秘書長回答。請阿專員去答一答。好啊，阿尤生。誒，主席，我哋喺個合約嗰度咧，係會定明一。

526
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:33,970
係列嘅誒表現嘅指標，咁如果嗰個營辦商咧係誒個表現係未達到嗰啲指標嘅話咧，首先我哋即係即係都係一一貫做法，首先做警告啦。咁如果警告都無效嘅話咧，我哋可以有罰則嘅。咁如果罰則都仲係無效，而佢一啲主要嘅指標係唔達標嘅話咧，喺個合約裏邊咧係好清楚嘅條款係賦予。

527
01:32:50,680 --> 01:33:10,690
係，多多謝主席。誒，以往咧就我記得上一屆區議會咧，維多利亞公園咧就係歸東區嘅，咁咧誒而佢亦都係計入東區嘅休憩用地。噉我哋成個東區嘅市民咧，其實一路都講呢個地方咧誒睇得唔用得啊，禮。

528
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:30,700
拜日咧就嗰度唔係香港嚟嘅，平時咧又經常搞啲大型活動，即係居民咧可以使用呢啲康樂設施嘅時間好有限，即係呢啲係過往居民嘅想法。咁但係今屆咧就維園就撥咗畀灣仔啦。咁咁引申過嚟咧就係而家我哋講緊嘅啟德體誒體育園。

529
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:37,610
噉。

530
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:32,450
誒個風險咧係要小心處理嘅，即係話如果，

531
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:37,670
噉樣，咁所以呢個應該係即係總體嚟講係超過一半嘅時間係畀市民係去享用嘅。

532
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:27,450
P添，咁之後市民用到嘅機會就微乎其微。究竟喺合約裏邊點樣確保誒市民同埋？

533
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:52,290
誒，承建商已經佢賺咗一大筆錢啊，因為喺承建個過程佢一定係即係豐厚嘅利潤。咁問題就係你嗰個保證金只係講緊六至九個月嘅營運期，其實喺佢成個利潤入邊只係佔咗好少嘅數目。即係話第日佢哋劈炮唔撈，其實佢哋個風成本或者風險好低。

534
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:58,490
政府咧就將所有所有目即係所有作用咧都擺曬落去，又要搞大型文化啦，誒又要搞比賽啦，又要搞城市啦，咁又要畀體育誒誒發展體育啦，畀運動員用啦。但係佢又計埋喺嗰個規劃標準裏邊，作為誒鄰近區。

535
01:33:58,490 --> 01:34:18,500
區域嘅休憩用地，噉我相信將來呢啲居民咧都會好關心嘅，呢啲地方有幾多機會係開放畀市民使用，有冇一啲指定嘅日數係一定要畀市民使用？因為咧，如果你話佢要盈利嘅、致富盈虧嘅，喂，佢梗係越做得越多活動越好啦，最好日日都都開。

536
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:47,780
公眾咧係有機會用到呢啲場地，而唔係得個睇字嘅咧，都係主席、秘書長。誒，主席其實咧，我哋會喺嗰個合約裏面咧，有好多個項目咧係保障翻市民或者政府嗰個利益嘅，包括咧誒頭先我提到幾項嘅社區設施嘅收費，點解要話佢要係同康文署係商約咧？我哋會。

537
01:34:47,780 --> 01:35:07,790
寫喺合約裏邊嘅呢一個控制場地，淨係講開放日數得啦。你唔使同我講錢，我錢我知道。開放設施咧，如果係誒公共空間，即係話嗰個嘅八公頃嘅空間咧，係需要廿四小時開放畀市民使用。嗰個室內嘅運動場咧，有三分二嘅時間係要作為誒體育嘅活動，唔可以租出去畀其他嘅活動。而至於室誒。

538
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:27,800
嗰個嘅運動場咧，即係有個跑道運動場，亦都要係全部係作為一個嘅社區嘅用途，畀學校做誒體育會啊、等體育誒體誒呢個運動會啊噉樣樣。咁所以其實大部分嘅場地，唯獨是嗰個嘅主場館係可能係需要有特別去租一啲嘅團體去租用，畀一個租金之外咧，其他。

539
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:47,810
全部都係一個，你可以當佢一個公共嘅體育設施嚟到去處理，開放時間、收費都係由我哋去決定，而且亦都我諗，如果要公道啲嘅話咧，最好有指定日數，同埋頭先所講嗰啲咧，話誒三分之二要係運動項目。講真，其實喺嗰度搞得嘅咧，即係多數多數都係運動項目，譬如圍院都係搞運動項目。

540
01:35:47,810 --> 01:36:07,820
話不不停噉嘅足球比賽，誒街坊都未必係開放畀其他市民使用，所以其實大家好關心公眾使用有冇一啲指定嘅日子咧，就唔係話咩體育會啊，或者係某啲誒比賽啊，呢呢等等呢個誒希望誒再答。咁另外咧，想追問多一個嘅就係大家都。

541
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:27,830
都關心廿五年嗰個問題，其實咧誒，我哋有啲議員同事咧就關心呢個項目咧係誒有機會蝕嘅，唔一定必賺嘅。咁但係咧誒顧問畀我哋嘅文件咧就話，其實都guarantee賺嘅啊，即係畀佢賺足廿五年都冇問題。但係問題，我覺得。

542
01:36:52,570 --> 01:37:12,580
個啫噃點樣避免呢個情況出現咧？啊，秘書長誒，主席，關於個開放嘅時間咧，向公眾開放咧。如果係公眾運動場咧，基本上係一百分之一百嘅啦，佢唔可以攞嚟去租畀人搞一啲嘅即係誒exclusive嘅活動嘅。至於嗰個室內體育館咧，我哋話三分二裏邊誒係要做體育活動啦。其實而家根據我哋。

543
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:32,590
誒嘅計算咧，大概全年咧喺依三份，即係大概二百幾日裏邊咧，大概四十零日咧係會搞活動嘅，即係話會係體育活動啦，或者係其他嘅活動，即係話有成百幾二百日咧係可能係畀應該係畀羽誒市民book嚟打羽毛球或者係籃球、排球等等嘅活動，即即係好似而家我哋康文署嘅體育館噉樣。

544
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:58,180
咁誒，至於個保證金嗰度咧，我哋提交喺誒，畀提交畀立法會嘅文件咧，就話係六個六至九個月嘅基本嘅運作費用。咁呢個咧就要足夠我哋咧喺呢段時間可以做翻一個招標啊等等嘅工作。實際嘅金額咧，我哋學而家仲喺度計緊，係應該咧係會作為一個都有幾有阻嚇作用，即係唔可以畀佢隨便噉。

545
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:48,670
先咧，其實。

546
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:01,480
絕大部分咧。

547
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:59,180
係非常之罕見嘅。

548
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,270
嘅所謂DBO咧。

549
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,890
澳洲二零一五年。

550
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:46,160
採用嘅model都係DBFO。

551
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,350
另一個case咧就係新加坡嘅。

552
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:43,100
啊，新加坡的Sports Hub。

553
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:15,030
建造費用嘅嗱，以下講幾個例子畀大家聽下。

554
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:55,130
會係用呢一種政府全部出地、出錢、出大型維修費。

555
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:25,180
柏斯啊，New Birth Stadium，佢用嘅係DBFM嘅model。

556
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:10,010
都係會需要嗰個中標嘅財團咧，係要承擔部分甚至大部分嘅。

557
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:06,340
噉樣去唔做嘅一個嘅嘅數額嚟嘅，但係嗰個具體嘅數啊，我哋嘅仲喺度計緊，但係大概六至九個月嘅盈馴。咁幾時會有呢個數啊，主席？

558
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:35,140
政府雖然有注資啊，呢個其實大家可以考慮嘅，就係財團咧，佢都要承擔四成嗰個誒建造費用。

559
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:44,390
噉，咁當然即係喺入標嘅時間，嗰啲投標者佢會有即係預預計嘅利潤。咁但係之所以我哋希望增加個競爭咧，就係希望咧喺競價嘅情況之下咧，係可以得到一個有競爭力嘅一個標價。啊，多謝主席。喺位啊，姚松炎議員第三次嘅兩分鐘。

560
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:26,700
誒，秘書長，有冇呢？我哋希望翻嚟再計一計嘅時候，可能即係我請阿專員去講。阿專員答埋我哋，因為我哋而家仲草擬緊個合約啦，咁所以我諗可能係需要稍後嘅時間先可以有。咁但係另外一樣嘢咧，就係誒，其實誒，阿國員講話啊，係咪誒建築費方面穩賺咧？

561
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,820
政誒。

562
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:30,560
第四個例子。

563
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,210
同樣咧，係要。

564
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,840
第三個例子，英國嘅。

565
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,690
Mountbatten Centre, U.K.

566
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:27,610
唔係由政府全部出錢起嘅。

567
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:23,750
所用嘅咧係DBOM嘅形式，都係。

568
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:53,220
誒中標嘅財團咧，係承擔財務嘅支出嘅。

569
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:18,910
合組新嘅誒公司去市場集資借貸嘅。

570
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:51,560
再早啲嘅一九九四年澳洲新新威士都係用B O O T嘅形式嘅，都唔會係好似香港呢一個case噉樣。

571
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:11,950
州政府雖然佢要承擔五百四十九萬磅嘅誒成本咧，但係咧係另外嘅一千萬磅係透過。

572
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:42,200
北京嘅奧運場館，二零零八年用嘅PPP形式，政府係出五十八個percent，私人財團係出四十二個percent嘅。

573
01:40:53,080 --> 01:41:13,090
誒誒，辯署長係誒，其實頭先阿姚議員提嗰啲嘅例子咧，我哋都有研究過嘅。誒，當然如果佢純粹起一個單一嘅體育大嘅主場館咧，而係可以畀佢作一個商業嘅用途咧，其實佢可能都會有一個誘因咧，係去誒，即係投資。但係我因為我哋而家呢一個嘅。

574
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:33,100
做法咧係需要佢去起埋呢一個嘅誒社區嘅體育設施，誒而且佔我哋整體三百一十九億裏邊咧，嗰個嘅誒其他嘅體育設施、公共空間咧，佔嘅百分比都相當之高。而呢啲設施係不能夠賺取到任何嘅誒呢一個嘅投資嘅回報。咁所以我哋就覺得咧，如果純粹用一個DB。

575
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:53,110
F.O.嘅形式咧，要佢自己去出資三百億到去起咧，係嗰個投資回報係不足以咧，係令到佢覺得係有興趣入標嘅。咁當然即係新加坡嗰個例子咧，佢係D.B.F.O.啦。我哋都瞭解過咧，其實佢亦都有一個嘅牽頭嘅融資嘅公司咧，係去誒去去做。但係政府咧喺個D.B.

576
01:41:53,110 --> 01:42:13,120
啲嘅時間咧，D.B.去去設計同埋營運嘅時間咧，其實個參與度咧係好少嘅，因為錢唔係政府出啊嘛，係嗰個財團去出噉，所以我哋就唔想有重複呢個情況，就係話政府喺頭段階段係冇辦法可以有個嘅高度嘅參與，要去到後邊我哋作為營運嘅時候咧，我哋就先要透過所謂一個嘅誒。

577
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:45,140
多謝主席。

578
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,780
嗰啲做生意唔使你教嘅。

579
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:11,640
嗰個投標嗰位中國財團。

580
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:18,570
因為政府已經畀三百十八億佢㗎啦。

581
01:43:38,730 --> 01:43:42,320
入邊揾嘅游水都已經夠佢七年有多嘅啦。

582
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,660
難聽啲，佢係根本係實食冇黐牙。

583
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:43,010
好，下一位係啊郭家麒議員第二次嘅三分鐘。

584
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:38,370
做生意咁蠢，同你孭曬風險，佢淨係喺個建造。

585
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:38,840
呢啲都係睇過。對於我哋達到我哋嘅政策目標咧，唔係一個最好嘅一個嘅方式咯。

586
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:52,490
問題有政府蠢到加加零一，去用呢個方法去做，仲要使我哋納税人。

587
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:32,980
佢你話佢最初投嗰幾年，根據嗰個補充文件，籌五至七年風險最大。

588
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:26,350
起係佢，即係話簡單嚟講，我起多起少，我中間要食幾多嘅，佢梗係有有曬條數啦。

589
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:08,760
我就唔係好睇到呢個所謂你講嘅你個文件就話joint venture即係混合係最好，將來。

590
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:59,410
嗱，頭先啊姚議啊姚姚議員提咗幾樣嘢咧，我都有抄過啲數字，因為你喺呢一個你入邊講嗰個投標入邊有三種模式嘅，政府出資、誒私人融資、畀曬或者係混合。

591
01:43:53,590 --> 01:44:08,970
咁多錢去做個顧問出嚟，出一樣嘢係同我哋嘅市民嘅意願係相反。嗱，如果你話係一個混合融資或者join venture嘅，點會出現嗰個財權係幾乎唔使錢嚟咧？

592
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:33,130
unitary payments去畀翻嗰筆錢去使用，咁即係我哋其實係一個用家。我哋出咗地，但係我哋就係只係用家去買翻嗰啲時段去使用呢一個模式咧。我哋覺得喺睇到體育員嚟講咧，係一個唔係咁理想嘅模式嚟嘅。咁所以顧問顧問亦都頭先提咗咧，我哋研究咗嗰幾個，譬如話誒誒join venture啊、DBF啊。

593
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:55,170
所以。

594
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,680
佢同你看。

595
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,370
個營運嘅費係佢㗎嘛？

596
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:52,490
佢點會帶錢同你做㗎？

597
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:58,090
To answer the question on a joint venture.

598
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,940
你嗰啲餐飲租出嚟都有租去分嘅。

599
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,890
佢梗係賺到夠喺個營運嗰度賺到盡。

600
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:58,000
噉你咪揾其他香港人揾咯，因為如果你啲酒店賣出嚟，

601
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:31,110
其實呢個世界上冇免費嘅午餐嘅，你叫佢看。

602
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:34,880
分中佢自己做埋嗰個其中一啲coordinator賺到盡，然後先至分畀你嘅，識唔識諗㗎？

603
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:08,380
酒店嘅地營運、餐飲嗰啲唔係落公堂，落咗佢個袋，佢攞證畀你。

604
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:23,740
要唔要揾佢去做啊？好啦，做個大型場館淨食肉嗰啲嘅，佢梗係食完先至同你分啦。

605
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:16,360
邊有咁離譜嘅嘢咧？你如果你要話叫叫佢做好嗰兩個小型嘅場館，你康文處自己都識做啦。

606
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:48,620
即係話，你康民處，你用筆錢去做就係用公堂嘅。你而家係呃自己，你以為啊，佢哋將來嗰個承辦商咧就係佢要負責嘅。佢一毫子都喺你嗰度攞翻嚟啊！

607
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:53,420
你點樣去考慮呢一樣嘢？咩叫join venture？話畀我哋聽。誒，秘書長。誒，首先要澄清一點咧，酒店唔屬於喺我哋今次申請嘅撥款嘅範圍裏邊嘅。酒店係會誒分開嚟處理，係要透過賣地條款處理。我可唔可以畀啊啊營運顧問講講個join venture嗰個實際情況？好，好，好，好。

608
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:26,430
呢個第一，第二嘅，你話係難聽啲，誒，咪玩完美搭嘴，即係話你做個主場館同埋酒店揾錢，其他嗰啲室內運動場同埋個足球場揾唔到錢，嗰兩個係你揀寫落去嘅。

609
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,190
嗯。

610
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:46,410
所以。

611
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:07,450
Would the

612
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:29,510
佢坐喺度做咩？

613
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:37,330
Government funds all the capital costs.

614
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:33,560
So, under the the proposed contract.

615
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:57,420
how much he makes? Yes, no, how much it bring along to the table.

616
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:18,510
And, you know, that would then have to be compared to the total capital cost.

617
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:12,930
a result of the potential profit in the in the business.

618
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,970
And the operating risk stays with the.

619
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:04,060
Who's going to do that? Yeah, Mr. Graham, yeah, please. You know, the joint venture will be a.

620
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:44,870
You know, so it would barely be a a a joint venture. Really, it would end up being government funded if you could get partners to come in and do that.

621
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:52,790
contracted party， the contracted party will have to invest some money operating. What is some money means? How much?

622
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:35,610
And I think when you compare those two numbers, you would end up with a joint venture, which would be 99. something percent government, and and a fraction private sector in terms of how much money against the capital cost the operation could afford to put into it.

623
01:46:46,690 --> 01:47:06,700
所以它係， in fact， not a joint venture. As you mentioned, it's more than ninety nine point nine percent of the capital is coming from the government. So how could we qualify as a joint venture? Tell me. We don't think it would work as a joint venture. That's why we've said. That's why that was eliminated. We don't think that would be attractive. So what is the difference between your saying about the

624
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:26,710
and about the present situation. Again, more than thirty one billion is coming from the government. So, how much will the future bid? The bidding, the one who won the bid will will be given in money terms.時間過得比較多啦，不過唔係叫佢答啊，佢唔係答問題㗎嘛。

625
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,520
好，我我係楊天元。

626
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:19,860
藝術家又好，佢哋真正嘅需要咧。

627
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:47,520
嗱，難聽啲，即係你哋咧就睇到最好，就並非係D.P.O。

628
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:56,970
世界咧能夠管理得到有呢一個即係技術嘅，亦都冇幾多個人，所以佢都係好複雜噉樣，可能自己要做一個協調。

629
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:21,700
個議員誤會咗啊！我哋嘅顧問嘅意思，顧問嘅意見係話，如果用一個joint venture嘅模式咧，睇翻呢個體育園佢所誒需要嘅建築費用同埋佢日後嗰個嗰個收入咧，基本上唔係一個可行嘅方案。如果係想用joint venture嘅模式嘅話咧，政府係需要咧。

630
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:41,710
佔嗰個joint venture嘅股本咧，係接近九十九個percent噉嘅方式去去做啊。噉我諗可能呢方面即係可能噉。你而家話畀我聽呢個就係你嘅文件寫joint venture係最較適合啊嘛。你而家呢個實際係乜嘢嚟嘅？係提升提誒倡議，join venture倡議係D B O嚇。join venture我哋已經roll咗㗎啦。即係呢個其實。

631
01:48:48,020 --> 01:49:08,030
但我唔知你點解會做到個決定咧，就係DBO係最好啦，因為我我我唔知道啊，國議員可能誤會咗我，似乎一路聽顧問嘅誒嘅嘅頭先嘅誒誒個PowerPoint presentation咧，同埋收尾答咧都都亦都唔認為join venture係可行啊嘛，即係呢個似乎你誒誒，主席或者我哋嘅。

632
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:28,040
PowerPoint裏邊咧，其實一二喺第誒第八頁嗰度有提到joint venture啦。呢個係我哋已經排除咗嘅一個。唔係點解你會排除呢一樣嘢？誒，頭先顧問就解釋。但係點解排除已經解釋咗好多啦。我諗時間過得太多太耐啦嚇，就請阿劉小麗議員第二次嘅三分鐘。多謝主席。嗱，其實我都重申啦，我一直都係支持音樂。

633
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:48,050
活動同埋即係體育活動嘅發展嘅，我只係有啲擔心政府而家想做嘅嘢咧，其實係有啲貪心嘅。一次過咧，將好多好多唔同嘅訴求擺埋去一個體育園嗰度，而呢一個咁複雜嘅營運同設計咧，好明顯政府自己都話其實你自己介預唔到嘅，而通。

634
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:17,260
咁嚟到而家，如果我哋咁冇信心，然後世界上得咁少人經營到、設計得到，究竟如果呢二十五年佢營運得唔好，呢一隻大怪獸有邊一個夠膽去接手咧？咁會唔會我哋又係再一次淪為洗濕咗個頭，跟住又揾唔到？

635
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:37,270
白冇事畀人哋禁住嚟砌，再一次嘅喪權欲講咧，咁呢個就係一個疑問啦。因為我哋話一路都係想確保佢有錢賺，有足夠嘅有因，所以要營運廿五年。咁但係營運得唔好，我哋自己又唔識監管，咁鬼複雜。咁究竟既然都營運得唔好啦，仲有邊個白冇事夠膽打救我哋咧？呢個

636
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:57,280
係我一個疑心，而但係我呢個第一個問題啦，政府係會點樣解決呢個問題啦？另外一樣嘢，我更加想問嘅咧，就係除咗盛世化，其實表面上叫盛世化，其實即係娛樂化啦噉。但係其實最重要嘅可能係精英化，我哋要培養我哋本地嘅精英嘅表演者同運動員。噉我就好想知道呢個即係體育員究竟能？

637
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:17,290
夠點樣去達至呢個目標？因為我見到嘅就係你將好複雜嘅要求，又娛樂又城市噉樣一次過嚇，又商業化嘅元素一次過擺落嚟。究竟由佢哋去設計，由佢哋起嘅呢啲小型嘅表演場館，究竟係有冇辦法去符合我哋嘅體體育運動員又好，或者係？

638
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:40,150
譬如我想問你哋究竟諮詢過啲乜嘢本地嘅運動員，而佢哋嘅意見係點樣樣？可唔可以有清晰嘅文件一一去交代？譬如咧，因為我喺公眾嘅電子傳媒嗰度見到佢哋嘅即係意見咧，同你哋所表述嘅係好唔一樣嘅。譬如我哋嘅跳高運動員楊文慧，佢就話啦，即使咧將軍澳。

639
01:51:40,150 --> 01:52:00,160
嘅場館咧，其實已經係符合咗國際田聯嘅標準。其實喺好多細緻嘅地方上面，譬如嗰啲物料啦、距離啦，其實都係即係冇辦法令到佢得到恰當嘅培訓嘅。如果我哋交畀一個咧好商業元素好重嘅一個builder，噉樣去做一個設計，最終會唔會其實都係摧毀咗即係本地？

640
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:20,170
體育運動員佢哋真正嘅需要咧，你哋係點樣去確保佢哋係得到適當嘅場館同埋訓練咧？而亦都有好多嘅運動員、李慧詩又好，或者係藝術家，譬如最近嘅希頓阿詹德畀人打壓，我哋就見到咧，其實本地嘅精英精英藝術家又好，體育員誒體育運動員又好，佢哋需要嘅係好細嘅life。

641
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:23,060
誒時間都差唔多啦。我問咗三條問題嘅，唔好意思。誒冇辦法啦，因為你已經過超咗時啦。嚇，你再撳下一次問啦，因為今日嘅。

642
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:54,570
誒，議員其實體育體育園誒場裏誒體育體質體育園裏邊咧，其實有即係不同嘅設施嘅。啊，我諗呢個已經重複好多次嘅啦。下一位係阿譚文浩議員，噉啊兩分鐘，第二第三次。我諗阿譚文浩議員咧問完之後咧，我哋都要完結今日嘅會議啦。嚇，先係譚議員。

643
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:37,370
download翻落嚟，再交畀各位參考。係同埋咧，佢哋其實我哋話有佢有佢哋有個意見，就話佢哋唔係要呢啲大型嘅國際賽事啊嘛，佢哋要係本地嘅細型嘅好直接嘅表演場館。咁呢個體體德體育園其實係有冇去誒 fulfil到佢哋嘅要求？

644
01:56:54,910 --> 01:57:12,950
體育園嘅一部分，由一個同一個營運商營辦咧，係可以令到嗰個誒人流啊、嗰個運動嘅氣氛啊、嗰個誒嗰個誒係嗰個園區成個嗰個誒vibing時咧係會增加嘅，所以我哋誒認為咧呢個係一由同一個營運商去處理咧係會比較適合嘅。

645
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:40,180
house或者係場館去做到本地同國際嘅好直接嘅小型嘅交流，咁究竟我哋有冇噉樣嘅設施係做到即係終於去培訓嗰個本地嘅精英咧？時間啦，秘秘書長嚇，簡短回應。啊，請阿專業啦嚇。誒，主席喺精英化方面咧，我諗兩方面答啦。第一方面咧就係誒，我哋日後有咗。

646
01:52:40,180 --> 01:53:00,190
睇得體育園裏邊嘅室內啊體育啊體育館啊，同埋其他嘅設施之後咧，誒好多體育會咧都係會誒計劃咧，係將佢哋而家做緊嘅城市咧係會升級做一啲更加大型嘅比賽，譬如話羽毛球啊、乒乓波嗰啲，係做一啲希望誒大啲嘅國際賽，令到我哋嘅運動員咧係有機會喺香港咧係。

647
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:20,200
場去作賽參與呢啲賽事嘅噉，另外亦都希望咧係將一啲新嘅賽事咧係帶到嚟香港噉，亦都係畀精英運動員更加得多機會參賽。我舉個例子，譬如最近喺誒場地世界盃賽誒嘅誒嘅世界錦標賽裏邊，因為我哋香港主辦呢個賽事，所以我哋有啲年輕嘅運動員，佢雖然嘅水平未必係去到世界級，但係都有機會咧。

648
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:40,210
係去參與呢啲嘅嘅賽事。咁誒，第二方面咧就係我哋喺呢個喺啟德體育園咧，我哋喺過去呢一啊年多兩年嘅時間咧，誒亦都做咗好多嘅諮詢，包括咧我哋同體育嘅總會啦、同運動員啦，誒亦都做咗個公眾嘅參與活動。噉我哋咧喺而家啟德體育園咧，我哋已備嗰個誒招聘。

649
01:53:40,210 --> 01:54:00,220
呢個文件，我哋會一係列嘅用家要求，而呢啲用家嘅要求咧，其實都係吸納咗咧呢啲體育總會同埋運動員嘅意見。所以日後我哋個場地咧係會誒設計到咧係會符合到咧係國際最新嘅標準，同埋咧係參有運動員佢哋畀嘅意見去參與其中其中嘅。多謝主席。主席誒，其實。

650
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:20,230
都係追問嘅，因為佢冇答到我一啲仔細嘅嘢。譬如咧，可唔可以去即係提交啲文件，就係你諮詢過啲乜嘢運動員或者係乜嘢人士佢哋具體嘅意見係乜嘢噉啊？你嘅要求理解啦，可唔可以提出提交呢個噉樣嘅文件？嚇，有關呢個諮詢嗰個情況嚇。誒，我哋其實喺我哋嘅網站嗰度咧，已經係有咗嗰個諮詢嘅結果。不過，如果我哋係將佢。

651
01:54:54,850 --> 01:55:14,860
誒唔該，主席嗱，我問題有三個嘅。嗱，第一咧就關於呢一個嘅誒聯合嘅委員會啦，即係負責監察一個嘅其實園區嘅。咁喺你之前委員喺誒事務委員會嘅文件裏邊咧，就就咁講話會有個架有呢個架構，但係就冇講呢一個嘅委員會嘅代表嘅比例，即係。

652
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:34,870
幾多位係邊一個政府啊，或者係營運商啊，咁等等呢個組合啦，同埋佢嘅權力究竟去到邊？呢個第一個問題。第二個問題咧就係關於你嗰個嘅誒保證金金額嗰度咧，就話六至九個月嘅基本運作開支咧，我就認為係偏少嘅，因為雖然你話係有足夠嘅時間嚟到重新招標。

653
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:54,880
但係唔好忘記，可能重新招標咗之後咧，可能佢本身嘅設計或者有啲嘅設施需要一啲嘅改動咁等等咧。其實可能分分鐘咧，成個園區受影響嘅時間咧就唔係九月咁少噉，所以我覺得咧十二個月至到十八個月咧，可能更加合適嗱。至於第三個問題咧，就係誒呢一個嘅園區咧，其實有一個係。

654
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:53,400
係政府同埋嘅顧問公司即係商量，因為下一次會議咧係喺五月十七號星期三係上晝八點三十分舉行㗎。好多謝各位。

655
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:14,890
係公眾運動場啦，我先唔好講。另外一個係樓下有誒商鋪嗰個先啦。咁如果純粹一個公眾運動場咧，點解唔可以起咗之後咧就交翻畀康文署嚟到負責嗱？因為呢個其實一個雞肋嚟嘅，即係賺嘅錢一定係唔多，但係佢又要營運，但係你收嘅錢咧又同康文署嚟到睇齊嘅話咧嗱。

656
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:34,900
我理解到另外一個個主場咧，因為佢下低有一個嘅商業運作模式，所以可能你都要比佢哋嚟到做，可能會做得更加好。對於上邊一啲嘅體育設施，但係對於個公眾運動場，可唔可以解釋下點解冇考慮過將呢一個係分翻出嚟？噉啊，三個問題，唔該，主席。好，誒，時間剩低唔好多，簡單啲回應嚇。

657
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:54,910
誒，專員誒，主席，關於嗰個誒户外運動場咧，因為其實佢亦都係嗰個體育設施嘅一部分，有好多活動咧誒，除咗喺譬如主場館裏邊做之後之外咧，譬如誒有一啲熱身嘅場地，亦都需要喺嗰個誒户外運動場嗰度進行，同埋咧誒，其實有一個噉嘅户外運動場係呢個。

658
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:43,350
個時間仲有一分鐘喎，主席。其實點解唔畀佢講埋咧？我都要講埋我幾句，就已經啱啱夠鐘啦嚇。嗰啲都計埋裏邊㗎。嗱，好多謝咧大家出席，特別係咧顧問公司嘅代表出席咧好嘅作用。誒，亦都有誒議員咧未問咧，就想話顧問係咪可以下一次會議都出席，即係五月十七號。咁或者呢個會後我再同。
