1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,350
主席。

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,620
立法會主席。

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,260
大家好嘅。

4
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
你見到佢見人就肥。

5
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,940
啊！喺度話啊，唔係啊，藍色水質冇害嘅。

6
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,250
咁嗰催淚水咧，哦，我哋可以加上佢。

7
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,620
嗱，即係呢一啲嘅，你撥咗款畀佢咧。

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,700
府狀態就係淨係得軍政府噉樣，呢個軍政府咧就係我頭先所講嘅啲警務處嘅人士。

9
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,580
警察部咧就只會係繼續濫用呢一啲嘅器材，或者頭先所講嘅呢一啲嘅車輛。

10
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,240
嗱，你再睇睇咧，其實誒今次修訂案削減佢哋嘅開支咧，啊，你見到嘅啊，特別有幾樣嘢想講嘅。

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:59,180
而我哋睇到咧，其實有咗好多嘅共通點啦，即係誒，包括呢個行政長官辦公室啦，同埋最主要都係警務處。

12
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:08,120
例如呢一個嘅警隊特別用途車輛，其實咩特別用途咧？佢嘅特別用途咪就係鎮壓市民咯，咪就係水炮車啫嘛，係咪？咁講呢個水炮車過去嘅使用咧，其實係亂嚟嘅。

13
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:43,460
往往佢哋嘅行為咧係完全冇任何嘅掣肘，去到今天係冇任何一個警察係需要為過去呢幾個月嘅事件嘅暴行係逮捕或者係作出任何真正嘅懲處，而唔係所謂嘅所謂嘅憤青。

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:29,050
由最初時，究竟裏邊有啲咩物質？點解係有藍色？點解喺裏邊有啲催淚水劑？當其時又話啊，藍色水劑咧係冇一個嘅傷害嘅。噉啊，講下講下咧，啊其實又話畀你聽，其實可以加呢個腐蝕水劑，喺度玩捉字謎。

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:49,230
我嘅發言咧，我係將會支持誒一個嘅張超雄議員、胡志偉議員同埋尹兆堅議員嘅修訂案嘅。咁至於原議案咧，我哋係必定係反對嘅。咁其實反對嘅理由咧，喺早前唔同嘅同事啊，或者喺終止辯論嘅時候咧，其實都係有提到過。

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:19,580
嗱，警務處咧，佢嗰個嘅即係輕竹難書，我先頭所講就係話喺過去呢段日子裏邊，大家都睇到呢一個嘅警務處如何地作惡，亦都見到我哋即係成個特區政府好似係一個，我哋有陣時講啲地方咧叫做無警狀況啊，香港咧就係無政。

17
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,450
作用係未必係可以發揮得到。

18
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,240
行政長官辦公室就將佢變為零啦嚇。

19
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,780
嗱，而另一個項咧，亦都係有講嘅削減係乜嘢咧？就係呢個特首辦。

20
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,330
啊！警察咧用呢一架噉樣嘅水炮車經過咧，就向我哋噴射，作出攻擊。

21
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,500
兩個月咁咧，就可以等新財政年度咧，就唔會有一個嘅空隙啊！政府唔會停擺。

22
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,980
可能只不過係得到一部分啊嘅選民嘅支持，未必代表佢嘅聲音係表達嘅大多數。

23
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:17,550
啊！得意之處咧就係我身邊嘅啊一位毛漢先生，一個嘅誒印度誒協會嘅前主席咧。

24
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,640
而頭先所講嘅，無論係警報問題，無論係點樣使用一啲嘅特別用途車輛等等，嗱，我哋都係表示強烈嘅反對。

25
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:47,370
咁點解對佢哋又完全唔需要道歉嘅咧？對佢哋係完全冇需要係表示任何嘅歉意，做錯嘢唔緊要嘅，主席。

26
00:02:46,430 --> 00:03:02,560
噉你話啦，噉我哋如何能夠支持佢咧？啊，甚至乎我自己都係其中一個受害者。啊，當然喺清真寺門口根本上係得嗰幾個人喺度，十個八個人喺度啊，亦都唔係咩高舉標語啊、嗌口號啊，全部都冇啲噉嘅事。

27
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:43,160
但係我哋見到喺過去嗱，我哋其實都貫徹貫徹中。咁舊年我哋都係反對你嘅財政預算嘅。既然我哋舊年反對你嘅財政預算，有乜理由係我哋係同意你信言？而家舊年我哋反對嘅財政預算，係到再營運多一兩個月咧？

28
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:37,840
事後咧，竟然警務處打電話畀佢喎，同佢道歉喎。林鄭又打電話畀佢喎，同佢道歉喎。但係我哋呢啲咧，唔好話我啊，你話我係一個政治人物啦，我身邊有其他嘅普通市民嘅喎啊，亦都有誒融樂會啊嘅總幹事，噉佢哋絕對揾到個特區政府。

29
00:03:47,650 --> 00:04:07,660
好多人都做錯嘢㗎啊！但係做錯嘢唔認，嗰個慘啊嘛。又或者做錯嘢係完全冇一個制約呢樣嘢，慘啊嘛。呢一個就係見到過去特區政府做嘅嘢就係冇制約噉，所以咧喺立法會作為立法會議員咧，我哋一個立法會議員咧，其實真係個作。

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:30,810
但係整個立法會就可以啦，所以點解喺基本法裏邊或者香港嘅法例裏邊係容許或者係授權啊？立法會係以一個整個立法會去到支持或者否決一啲嘅議案或者一啲嘅撥款咧，當然就係有頭先嘅種種原因啦。因為任何嘅選舉佢可

31
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
呢一啲係負責任嘅政府嚟嘅咩？

32
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,950
我再研究下點樣處理你嘅執笠啦～

33
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,520
唔係淨係黃絲爭你，而家黃絲、藍絲九成人都爭你喎。

34
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,060
我都唔知呢個概念點嚟嘅，咪睇得粵語長片多啫。今時今日仲嚇，或者係直頭唔睇電視嘅。

35
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,690
你就捉住一樣又學人哋，又學得唔足呢個特首辦啲人真係。

36
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:50,210
甚至乎佢哋覺得一直以嚟都係牢牢在手嘅一啲傳統界別嘅人，例如呢一班嘅飲食業界。

37
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:07,690
噉你講社交距離就唔能夠話啊，因為飲酒所以減少社交距離咩道理嚟㗎？咁啲跳舞班咧啊，你唔去禁曬佢跳舞。

38
00:06:51,210 --> 00:07:01,660
早幾日我都唔知係發生咩事啊！出嚟講又話啊，係啊，飲酒唔好啊，飲酒咧就飲多兩杯就話唔知點樣係會有親密嘅接觸。

39
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:18,910
音樂班咧嚇，有啲音樂噉，你你一個樂隊咁去側邊噉。而家蘭桂坊種嗰啲都係樂隊嚟嘅喎嚇，咁噉你唔準禁曬佢？

40
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:38,200
你走去學英國啊？人哋英國都啊撳酒包喎，人哋係有補償啊嘛，人哋係有諗，唔係就係你撳啊嘛，個後果咧。

41
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:57,500
你澳門都會禁賭場啊，咁香港你唔禁麻雀館啊，機鋪咧啊，種種根本上係好多我哋講緊嘅係嗰個嘅社交距離啊嘛。

42
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:40,940
咁可想然之啊！呢一個政府可以即係節儉到點，或者係黑人爭到點，係去到而家噉樣嘅民望同埋社會上邊唔同界別嘅人都係噉樣嘅聲音咧？

43
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:52,270
連帶出嚟嘅問題咧，冇諗嘅喎，唔使諗嘅喎，呢一個噉嘅特首辦完全唔使諗嘅喎。啊，總之你唔賣酒得㗎啦，我唔想知。啊，你冇飯開唔關我事。啊，你執粒唔關我事。

44
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:45,940
噉係咪啊？喂，根本上都唔係嗰樣嘢。你即係撳一樣酒，呢一個酒只不過係其中一樣嘅嘢啫。啲人飲茶坐得仲密添啦，分分鐘係咪？打麻雀啊，你唔好去撳麻雀麻雀館嚇。

45
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:58,390
所以我哋先至係用一個整體嘅議會，就希望將頭先所講嘅唔同嘅政治光譜，或者係唔同嘅職業啊、性別啦、年齡啦等等嚇，作為一個比較全面嘅一個嘅表達。咁所以先至會有呢一種嘅授權，令到我哋可以喺今天。

46
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:18,400
嚟到辯論呢一個嘅議案，而呢個議案頭先都講過㗎啦。我哋係不可能支持。其實呢一種嘅不可能支持咧，喺過去可能喺政府又覺得啊，點解你唔支持啊？啊，呢一個只不過唔係新嘅財政預算，呢一個只不過舊嘅財政預算就頂埋呢個零。

47
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:22,780
我哋會見到過去一個特首辦或者特別係講緊特首啊，過去嘅表現都唔使講㗎啦。無論喺成個反送中運動又好，或者係轉變到而家嗰個應對武漢肺炎嘅疫情，有好多所謂嘅藍絲嘅人都走出嚟話：而家唔。

48
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:30,210
呢啲噉嘅接觸或者係話親密接觸係因為飲咗酒咩？係因為飲醉酒咩？唔係啊，係因為啲人扮飲醉酒啊嘛，係咪先會發生㗎嘛？同埋而家啦，所有嘅親密接觸唔係經過飲酒㗎，而家用Apps㗎，噉你咪禁曬所有嘅Apps啊，所有嘅時鐘酒店咪全部禁曬佢噉。

49
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,690
越落。

50
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,350
再打咩？

51
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,780
撳走呢一單嘢咧，佢今日出嚟講嘅話。

52
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:01,240
電話講啦，相信梗係啦，佢唔出得嚟接受訪問啦。佢話唔關我事㗎，我冇去開會啊嗰次。

53
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:10,140
哇！呢啲又醒，即係你成日都認為哇，一個團隊啊，一個問責團隊啊，又講到呢一啲嘅誒人事點樣？

54
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:49,840
係啊！呢一個嘅議會兩次嘅大會，亦都放棄呢一個嘅行會嘅開會，佢又醒喎，唔知係咪其實知嘅咧？嗱，走呢一單嘢。

55
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:23,520
跟住另外湯嘉華啊，即係仲好嘢，走出嚟又喺度話：，哎呀，到皮不到肉啊！又喺度講埋曬啲，餵你四個人就唔應該走埋一齊啦，即係應該要立例嚟到做添。

56
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:16,840
制定任何政策，當你製造嘅時間，你必須係要確保顯生嘅效果後遺症，無論係好嘅後遺症定係壞嘅後遺症，你必須係要清楚嚟到沙盤推演，從而制定一啲嘅政策。

57
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:43,030
當然啦，佢佢佢所謂嘅翻工其實係唔會接觸到市民嘅。嗱，佢根本上咧就係一個好似一個温室嘅效應噉樣，温室嘅環境。佢由佢屋企就跟住上去架車，跟住咧嚟到特首辦，做完嘢就翻屋企。佢全個過程其實佢唔知咩叫民間集股，就係咁簡單。

58
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:37,500
去點樣減低嗰個影響啊嘛？又或者唔好畀一個政策而衍生一啲記得利益者，唔好畀佢攞咗着數啊嘛？呢個先係政府應該做嘅嘢，先係應該特首辦做嘅嘢啊嘛，去諗嘅嘢啊嘛，特首喺過去咧，人哋即係好標榜咩好打得，我都唔知。

59
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:58,940
打把有氣憤，而家真係你諗下過去呢幾個月以嚟，佢真係做咗啲乜嘢？香港人係覺得做得啱嘅咧。我真係唔係好知喺過去呢幾個月佢有乜嘢嘅決定出咗嚟，香港人係會拍手掌嘅，係話佢做得好嘅。我真係一樣我都諗唔到。

60
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:19,300
你見佢而家個民望低到噉，唔係冇佢嘅原因。你都見到呢一個特首辦，其實我都唔知佢係點樣嚟到運作嘅。甚至乎咧，呢一個嘅特首咧，佢好嘢在，即係成日都龍女雞作反嘅。佢成日咧都有啲行會成員咧就走出嚟同佢唱反調嘅啊，甚至乎啦佢。

61
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:39,310
個好姊妹啊，阿姐姐啊，葉劉淑儀議員啦，今日唔喺度啦嚇，亦都係因為上個星期啊去過呢一個珠海啊。當然我唔知去珠海做乜嘢啦，咁急切咁逼切，就有啲人話就想去尋龍噉樣。噉我唔知係咪真係揾盛龍嗰位啦。咁但係無論點都好啦，即係佢竟然係願意放棄。

62
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:43,960
嗱，你話係咪死啦？你身邊，你以為呢啲係你嘅盟友啊？轉個頭，個個插你一刀。咁插你一刀嘅有原因㗎嘛？啊，因為你好插啊嘛，係咪先？即係你擰轉背咁又一刀啦，擰轉背又一刀啦。其實全方位佢係可以，無論佢做乜都錯乜嘅，有幾難嘅啊？即係做。

63
00:11:43,960 --> 00:12:03,970
做而家嘅評論啊，或者報紙啊，其實好易做嘅。只要係講林鄭月娥咧，你幾乎係講唔出任何嘅優點，任何一樣嘢都係缺點嚟嘅。你話幾咁易即係收呢個稿費咧？咁多位係咪？甚至乎我而家你要我講講講，我冇㗎。我打開一份文件嘅咋，我唔係真係望住讀㗎。有幾難？一講十五分鐘啦，林鄭。

64
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:24,980
接受嘅喎，香港人冇問題嘅喎，集以為常嘅喎。你以為當日嘅梁振英可以係啊？邊有人可以仲衰得過梁振英嘅？又真係有嘅喎，佢真係青出於藍㗎呢一位女士，我真係好佩服佢，即係再行到呢一步咧，佢仲可以咁硬住頭皮。我唔知佢每一日翻工啦，或者係誒誒。

65
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,050
點解咧？

66
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,400
你諗一諗。

67
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,550
澳門基本法都冇講過有雙普選嘅。

68
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,590
一個噉嘅女人啊！

69
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,570
係好團結，亦都可以同情心。

70
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,210
下下都問人哋幾拍，下下都係人哋做先，你去抄人。

71
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:04,330
但係當佢去到一個領導者嘅地位咧，呢一啲嘅缺點咧，就一一呈現喺咁多香港市民嘅眼前。

72
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,410
啊！原來係打柴個蛋啊！你見到即係林鄭，仲要去到而家呢刻，佢啊即係～

73
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:31,020
嗱，大家都個兩制啫，你可以咁講。喂，如果你話香港嗰個嘅誒民主進程，喂，澳門更加冇添啦，係咪先？

74
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,720
一個咁冇能力嘅特首，我哋點能夠再支持呢一個行政長官辦公室繼續畀錢佢，繼續去支持一個咁廢嘅特首咧？

75
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:15,670
人哋澳門，人哋個特首做咗幾多個月啫？點解人哋畀佢個掌聲多你咁多嘅咧？你啲嘢～

76
00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:07,060
係啊！你嘅下屬畀啲乜嘢你，噉你就諗住嗰套嘢去做啦。全部都係咧紙上談兵噉啊推出嚟。嗱，呢一個武漢肺炎係完全睇得到佢個能力係去到邊嘅，就唔係我哋以前睇到嘅好打得。

77
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:57,030
佢接觸嘅官員，佢接觸嘅人啊，個個都以為係啊得啦，我話畀你聽，你啊做啦。係可能以前你唔係一個領導者嘅角色咧，佢只不過執行者角色咧，大家可能覺得係好出色。

78
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:53,930
咁但係點解你咁都可以差過去嘅咧？嗱，呢一個就係翻翻去我政制問題啦。點解香港冇雙普選呢個先係一個最大嘅問題，令到嗰個特首根本上係冇一個認受性啊嘛，冇一個認受性，特首好頭先咁講，佢都唔理民間疾苦，佢淨係埋頭望住自己本書或者。

79
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:34,800
眼淚都流埋啦！真係啊，佢真係七情上臉㗎啦，佢已經用盡功力掬到咗幾滴眼淚出嚟。但係香港人都係唔接受㗎，係咪香港人特別冇同情心咧？其實唔係，香港人係好有同情心嘅，特別喺過去呢幾個月嘅政治事件、喺街頭運動、喺呢個反送中浪潮，其實你睇到香港人。

80
00:14:41,050 --> 00:15:01,060
即係噉嘅年紀，我唔係話特別老啊，即係比較年長嘅女人喺呢面前喊，其實你都應該係有叮噹嘅感動啦，都覺得係哎呀，你真係陰公啦，你都係好盡力㗎啦，即係唔應該對你咁差。但係唔係喎，係鬧多兩錢重喎，鬧佢啊，憋啲眼淚出嚟啊，扮喊啊等等喎，咁所以。

81
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,750
走開。

82
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,340
係啊！

83
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,470
Mr. President.

84
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,420
In the past, sorry.

85
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,680
梗係唔可以啦～

86
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,200
And what we have done.

87
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,370
That is put forward in this chamber.

88
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,590
what we are debating today is.

89
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,780
must be deliberated seriously.

90
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,290
Our honourable friends on the opposite side.

91
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,520
一 Resolution proposed by the government, a vote on account.

92
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,830
Under the Public Finance Ordinance, Chapter 2 of the Laws of Hong Kong.

93
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,500
譚文豪議，係我明白泛起公心嘅，誒可唔可以點算法定人數？

94
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,170
但我比較唔同意呢個觀點，因為，Mr. President，任何。

95
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,150
have repeatedly mentioned that this is a kind of routine. This is a kind of normal procedure.

96
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,720
所以我哋係會誒支持頭先所講嘅幾個嘅修正案，亦都係會否決呢一個嘅原議案。報名緊先陳事，梁繼昌議員。

97
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,840
and.

98
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,200
但。

99
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,940
梁繼昌議員。

100
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,350
Okay, Mr President, I'm.

101
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,720
在過去。

102
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,420
now especially, Mr. President, in the past one year, in two thousand and nine.

103
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,660
最高 level of dissatisfaction with the government.

104
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,240
我極度不諒解這態度，因為任何那那係放。

105
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,370
inevitably，I think，our honourable friend on opposite side at this debate。

106
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,570
many in the government would have forgotten. may have may look like to me that they have forgotten that there are.

107
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:30,500
has been a kind of routine and is normal that I mean, this debate would not take more than a couple of hours.

108
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,140
and unfortunately, since the beginning of this year, with the onslaught of the COVID-19.

109
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:26,570
深根、orny政治 issue，which the government has not been able to tackle at all.

110
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:58,840
我們經歷過香港最大的 turbulence，最高 level 或公眾對政府的不信任。

111
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:45,610
under the agenda of this chamber, I think we need to deliberate, deliberate it properly and carefully.

112
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:14,190
have to continue with my speech. This debate is on the vote on account, based on a proposal, a motion put forward by the government under the Public Finance Ordinance, Chapter Two.

113
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,840
然而。

114
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,690
now the。

115
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,750
We need to fight the virus together.

116
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,780
secretary has proposed.

117
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,630
this will not distract us from saying that.

118
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,520
this point， we have a very high level of dissatisfaction with the government.

119
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,200
counting back in the colonial era, I would have thought that this is.

120
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,190
一headline figure of 215 billion.

121
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,240
and I could dare say that the level of dissatisfaction and the level of mistrust.

122
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,790
We need to fight it in this city. We need to fight it on a global basis, and this is our common enemy.

123
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,360
spending beginning from the first of April two thousand and two in the resolution.

124
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,200
with the government was the highest, not only after the handover, but I think even counting.

125
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:37,210
八百六十五萬七百一十三美元的 provisional。

126
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:50,530
now and of course, this headline figure will be restricted under the resolution under section four.

127
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:57,300
The political crisis, which was triggered in two thousand and nine, remained unresolved.

128
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:33,770
And now, of course, they are telling us that we need to tackle, we need to fight the COVID-19 virus. Yes, of course.

129
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,200
啊！

130
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,370
Off.

131
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,210
percentage of restriction.

132
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,020
being restricted by the twenty percent, for example.

133
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,020
say two months, two and half month, which is about twenty percent.

134
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,500
now I do have a problem with the 215 billion because.

135
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,190
of the budget itself, because that will be subject to further debates next week.

136
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,080
That is about one fifth of the total expenditure of the financial year, and of course there are certain

137
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:35,070
部門，which would have asked for a different figure， they're trying to say they're not。

138
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:19,320
now，generally，I，think，the，government，is，asking，for，a，provisional，funding，of，20%，of，215，billion.

139
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:29,780
如果政府係going to ask for basic funding of the operation of the government for

140
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:46,980
Underline 59，The Government Logistics Department is asking asking for 100% of their budget for 2020-2021.

141
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:09,780
Now, Mr. President, this is a this debate on provisional funding. We are not debating on the merits.

142
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:11,370
would be further amended by the exceptions under Schedule One and Schedule Two.

143
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:59,770
Under section 4A, Roman letter one, two, and section 4B, Roman letter one, two, and the respective.

144
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:59,240
And of course, the social service department underline 170 is also asking for some items to be funded 100%.

145
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,680
projected。

146
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,490
the budget.

147
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,200
next year's budget。

148
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,160
我會比較 happily。

149
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,860
但不幸地。

150
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,940
The minister is quite happy with.

151
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,070
Granted, this provision of funding.

152
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,660
then I would have be more comfortable.

153
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,500
The already very battered economy.

154
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:01,030
Based on last year's budget, which is the budget we have already agreed.

155
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,000
我會 not have any issue with it. But however, this 215 billion is based on the

156
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,580
如果某個部門會想一個增強的付款，來 subsidize。

157
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,050
what I would be more comfortable is that if they are based, this they they using a headline figure.

158
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,170
with what he has been doing in the past few years, and with what his predecessors have been doing.

159
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:11,220
在給一個赤裸裸的政府。 now of course this headline figure can further be adjusted.

160
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:24,970
By other figures in the more detailed departmental budget, for example, if you would like a an enhanced expenditure for some of the departments to fight the COVID nineteen virus.

161
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,230
政府運 running。

162
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,300
for the next two and half months.

163
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,110
now，which I I think he needs to justify。

164
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,340
proving the whole 215 billion.

165
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,870
我到一定extent會 not disagree with this attitude， but we are not。

166
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,690
The budget, the resources and the mandate to procure.

167
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,490
Why? Of course, I mean this is subject to a more detailed debate.

168
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,500
and inserted a quite a big figure of 215 billion.

169
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,950
and also，I I do hope the minister can in his reply。

170
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,450
We are giving you, the government, just enough resources to keep this.

171
00:34:54,150 --> 00:35:00,870
and there is also line one hundred and six, Mr President, in appendix two, which says miscellaneous, and this miscellaneous.

172
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:22,450
justify why some of the departments in the schedule one and schedule two would need to deviate.

173
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:30,280
now many of my colleagues in the opposite camp would say, oh, this is for livelihood, this is for fighting the the COVID-19 virus, and we need to approve this funding.

174
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:52,870
The medical equipment, the personal protective gears for various colleagues in the civil servants. But I am not going to answer these questions for the minister because he has to do his explanation.

175
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:35,430
from the 20% limit imposed on the provisional funding. Now, some of the departments, I I I could I could well guess why, because for example, the logistics department, I would have guessed that they would need.

176
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:18,090
Outlay is one billion dollars and I do need some explanation to that and why he needs this provisional funding of one billion dollars, as and not a a kind of you know percentage cap on this provisional funding.

177
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,540
They are.

178
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,550
resolution is about.

179
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,470
和首席執行官辦公室。

180
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,400
to give you adequate funding.

181
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,410
為咗嘅表現， of the government.

182
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,060
喺2019，過去一whole year。

183
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,680
debate is about and that is what this.

184
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,910
我 must say，extremely disappointed。

185
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,010
for anything that would help.

186
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,900
and these are the controversial issues which I think the public.

187
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,910
至少，一majority sector of the citizens are not.

188
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,920
our economy in the next two and a half months， and that is what this。

189
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:17,010
And of course, my honourable colleagues on my side has tabled quite a few amendments.

190
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:33,310
happy with why the government need to spend such money on these departments, including the police.

191
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,920
to provide just adequate funding to fight the COVID-19 virus.

192
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:56,070
and nothing has been done yet, today, to address the dire political situation we're in. Now, of course.

193
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,300
have。

194
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,100
the virus.

195
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,900
events。

196
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,670
gone and past, and now we are tackling.

197
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,750
now what what is the point of this policy?

198
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,550
但係， of course，我do do有啲 respect for the religion。

199
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,880
you are， we are not a Muslim country。

200
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,030
就 forbid people using the airport for transit.

201
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,460
for the bars and the licensed places to sell alcohol.

202
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:23,420
但係，什麼是點解要禁售酒精喺呢個城市？

203
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,580
people will still come to the bar to chat. They can order a fruit punch. They can order.

204
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:55,580
但一啲我唔理解， yesterday係一種禁售酒精。

205
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,550
And I do think that in Muslim countries, they need to ban gambling. They need to ban the sale of alcohol.

206
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:16,890
Now I must say that the government has been quite slow in implementing, proposing and implementing a lot of these policies.

207
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:31,270
In recent one or two weeks, now of course we've seen the blunder committed by certain governments in Europe, including Italy, Spain, United States and the United Kingdom.

208
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:45,310
and of course we've we've seen that the government is trying to close down the borders to foreign visitors, trying to restrict passengers from using the Hong Kong International Airport.

209
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,040
You need.

210
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,400
now if。

211
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,380
This is a.

212
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,980
要規ulate。

213
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,020
坐廳密度。

214
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,730
啊！檸檬茶。

215
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,390
policy blunder， I think。

216
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,390
and have closed social contact.

217
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,020
You need to regulate.

218
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,310
In order to contain the infection.

219
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,930
要 have less social contact. Be realistic. You need.

220
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,160
The number of people sitting at each table.

221
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,620
our situation become worse and worse, you need.

222
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:22,320
to close down the restaurants and the bars for a couple of weeks.

223
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:45,130
and I think you need to readdress the situation if you want to distance people if you want

224
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:57,310
要限制操作 hours operating hours of the restaurants. You need to restrict the operating hours of the restaurants and bars.

225
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,650
Blunder.

226
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,180
sectorial interest.

227
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,320
those clients who brought the alcohol to the place.

228
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,700
Now of course I'm just using this as an illustration.

229
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,340
and this is a highly contagious virus.

230
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,960
inexplicable and and quite stupid, you know, policy moves.

231
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,830
我希望，香港政府，could。

232
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,090
and do not be swayed by any, you know.

233
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,230
I don't see why. I mean, we are debating on how to legislate.

234
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,690
Is it permissible? Are you going to punish the owner of the bar, or are you going to punish?

235
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:48,080
在， directing your policy. Your policy is for the health.

236
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,620
考慮The wider policy implication more deeply before announcing it in public.

237
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:09,260
先生，我只用呢個，作為一個，一個政策。

238
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:18,050
Well, in the past, I think the the Hong Kong SAR government has done a lot of quite, you know.

239
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:43,570
一 bans on selling of alcohol, and I don't see that would be any easy piece of legislation.

240
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:52,630
and it would be difficult. and how about people bring alcohol or to the spot and consume on the spot of the the bar or or the licensed place?

241
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,280
Now.

242
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,380
政治嘅 blunder。

243
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,730
and well-being.

244
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,070
Politics here.

245
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,640
個 policy。

246
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,960
我們有個義務。

247
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm sorry, this is.

248
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,610
到國際社會， as well.

249
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,840
和香港作為國際城市。

250
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,600
We should be resigning from a seat. This is a place.

251
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,290
立法會，如果我們 not 議論。

252
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,590
所以，why should I be paying you 215 billion dollars for committing these?

253
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,750
for political decision. This is a place for deliberating the different causes.

254
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,130
of the all the citizens of Hong Kong, and not to protect certain sectorial interests.

255
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:21,070
many of my colleagues in the opposite camps also say this is a kind of livelihood you know debate. We should not pull in too much politics, but

256
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:51,170
And I think this is a political decision. If we were to vote down on this vote-on-account resolution, thank you, Mr. President.有冇其他議員想發言？

257
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,780
符合公眾利益。

258
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,300
具體安排亦都同過往係完全一致。

259
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,560
政府係有必要提出臨時撥款決議案。

260
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,270
因此，二零二零年撥款條例將唔會喺嗰日期之前實施。

261
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,840
維持日常運作，嚴重影響警務處為市民提供嘅服務。

262
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:57,350
過去十年只有兩年運用調撥款額嘅權力應付個特別嘅需要。

263
00:41:53,250 --> 00:42:03,520
如果冇，我現在請局長就修訂案發言，之後表決議員提出嘅修訂案。財經事務及僱務局局長。

264
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:25,230
正如我之前強調，申請臨時撥款係沿用已久，涵蓋所有政策局部門辦公室，包括行政長官辦公室嘅必要程序。

265
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:50,470
我亦都想強調，財政司司長一向謹慎運用有關嘅權力，並且會喺財委會嘅報告有關權力佢哋嘅使用情況，即係調撥誒款額嘅使用嘅情況。

266
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:22,310
主席，按照我哋今年財政預算案嘅時間表，二零二零年撥款條例草案嘅最後階段係會喺立法會二零二零年四月二十九號嘅會議上係進行。

267
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:44,800
為咗確保喺今年四月一號新財政年度開始時，政府唔會因為缺乏資源而需要停止包括教育、社會福利、醫療衞生、保安等與市民息息相關嘅公共服務。

268
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:14,780
就香港警務處而言，佢個總開支八成到係由員工誒嘅相關開支，係屬於按月支付性質，因此絕對唔會出現由財政司司長一筆過撥款畀警務處嘅情況。

269
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:35,250
有議員關注臨時撥款額嘅佔款嘅總額嘅整體比例係高達百分之三十四，係較以往為高。正如我之前所講，今年嘅臨時撥款金額二千一百五十九億嘅計算方法同以往係完全一致。

270
00:42:50,040 --> 00:43:10,050
張超雄議員、胡志偉議員同埋尹兆堅議員提交嘅修訂案，建議削減行政長官辦公室同埋香港警務處嘅所有開支，包括個人薪酬。呢啲議案係缺乏理據，而且係極不合理，亦都唔係。

271
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,440
誒，另外亦都有係嗰個。

272
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,920
佔總開支嘅比例大概百分之二，屬於正常水平。

273
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,540
在我請張超雄議員動議去抵項修訂案之前。

274
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:19,710
誒總目九十，分目二百零，係畀職業安全健康局嘅撥款。

275
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:20,640
所以，我特區政府我哋係強烈反對有關嘅修訂，並且呼籲議員否決呢啲修訂。多謝主席。

276
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:42,650
有議員擔心臨時撥款議案獲得通過，會畀政府有過大嘅權力動用撥款。我請議員不必過慮。

277
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:33,010
總括而言，議員提出嘅四項修訂議案係會嚴重削弱政府有效提供公共服務同埋履行僱主法律責任嘅能力。

278
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:21,150
有關部門係會等2020年撥款條例草案獲得立法會通過之後，先至會展開有關新嘅項目嘅相關工作。

279
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:09,910
呢啲新嘅項目係包括添置新裝備同埋開展新計劃等，而呢一項承諾同樣適用於香港警察誒香港警務處。

280
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:26,530
而警務處嘅非經營開支，即係機械設備同埋工程，包括購置車輛有關嘅開支，都只係約五億元。

281
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:51,210
執法傷亡賠償噉樣，另外第三類例子咧就係應付緊急災難事故，譬如總目一七零社會福利處分目一七七緊急救濟等。

282
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:58,400
政府一貫嘅承諾係喺臨臨時撥款期間，有關納入預算裏邊與二零二零年撥款條例草案一同提交立法會審議嘅新嘅項目，係不會有任何開支。

283
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:38,790
第二方面就係話有啲款項咧，係因為佢嗰個需求變動咗，而嗰個有關嘅款項咧係唔可以延遲支付嘅。個例子就係總目一七零社會福利署分目一七六暴力及。

284
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:49,590
如果行政長官辦公室喺二零二零年四月一號財政年度開始嘅時候，得唔到所需要嘅資源應付日常開支而冇法運作，將來會嚴重影響行政長官辦公室嘅職能，包括支援行政長官同埋行政會。

285
00:43:49,590 --> 00:44:09,600
二對目前香港嘅抗疫同埋防疫工作嘅統籌，尤其影響極大。另外，就香港警務處而言，其責任係服務社會大眾，維持社會治安同埋維護法紀。議員提出嘅修訂案係會令警務處缺乏足夠嘅資。

286
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:53,380
如果呢啲修訂議案獲得通過，主要公共服務將會陷入混亂，政府嘅運作亦都會受到嚴重嘅幹擾。呢啲議案係會造成極大嘅負面影響，係唔係符合公眾利益嘅？至於頭先議員有提到關於我哋呢一個經，

287
00:46:53,380 --> 00:47:13,390
常開支嘅分目有一啲嘅誒要求喺個附表一裏邊係多過百分之二十被付款額嘅原因，其實呢啲有幾幾類原因，有一啲係因為啲款項咧係按季度支付，所以變咗四月嗰陣時候傾要支付三個月嘅費用。誒，例如就係好似勞工處。

288
00:47:51,810 --> 00:48:11,820
所以主席，我哋見到呢一啲噉嘅項目係令到我哋個附表一係需要有啲項目係增係多過百分之二十。整體嚟講，我哋主理呢一個誒撥款條例呢個嘅臨時撥款條例嘅誒安排，都係同以往都係一樣噉樣嘅誒安排。

289
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,560
開始票決。

290
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,170

300
