1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,740
早晨。

2
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,200
主席。

3
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,960
所見嘅。

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,320
未能選出主席。

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,340
交付嘅事務。

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,460
亦都係處理大會。

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,300
影響立法會履行憲制嘅職能。

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,800
內會係立法會最重要嘅委員會。

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,010
我已經尋求咗資深大律師嘅意見。

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,150
但係今個會期發生嘅情況咧，係從未。

11
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,630
誒，各位就內會內務委員會。

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,800
佢係預備大會議程上嘅事項。

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,090
議會內咧係完成咗選舉，正負。

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,450
根據歷屆嘅經驗，內會都係一次。

15
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,440
亦都希望係盡快解決現時嘅困局。

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,220
內會自去年十月十五日開始選主席嘅程序。

17
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,780
嘅影響。

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,800
好遺憾。

19
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,720
我亦都注意到。

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,550
下而作出嘅。

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,390
選出正副主席。

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,470
到十月底都未能。

23
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,840
五號、六號、七號咧，開舉行特別會議。

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,700
使到立法會能夠正常運作。

25
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,640
而秘書處法律顧問喺十月咧已經詳細。

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,300
解釋未能選出主席，對內會運作。

27
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,520
議員放下政治，盡快完成內會嘅選舉。

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,660
當時嘅法律分析係基於內匯喺正常運作嘅情況。

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,570
內會主席李慧瓊曾經安排喺二月初。

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,610
我係一直密切留意事態嘅發生，亦都係多次公開呼籲。

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:49,770
去由去年十月至今年嘅年初咧，內會都未能夠選到主席。

32
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:40,410
亦預期內會一如以往咧，可以喺短時期內咧係完成主席嘅選舉。

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,020
內會主席。

34
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,770
但係都選舉唔到。

35
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,260
到本屆嘅。

36
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,090
去務求盡快選舉。

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,370
履行憲制嘅責任。

38
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,640
內會冇辦法正常運作。

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,120
我已經收到資深大律師嘅意見。

40
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,140
特別係審議法案同埋附屬法案。

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,780
因此，我喺三月底咧，透過秘書處。

42
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,920
所以係必須要尋求解決嘅方法。

43
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,930
第七十三條所述嘅多項職能。

44
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,430
令立法會係冇辦法履行基本法。

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,680
但係由於疫情嘅嚴峻咧，會議係最後被逼取消。

46
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,640
就如何解決內會嘅問題咧，係尋求外間資深大律師嘅法律意見。

47
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:11,570
立法會對依個新嘅問題，我作為主席有責任去確保立法會有效。

48
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:42,470
直至到疫情比較穩定嘅時候咧，現任內會主席喺三月十三日咧，在該行會議去選舉主席。

49
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,370
例如。

50
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,730
總括嚟講。

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,580
現任內會主席。

52
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,260
主持選舉。

53
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,950
喺新任主席尚未選出前。

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,320
外間資深大律師確認。

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,800
大家都要留意到，而家內會。

56
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,510
此外，現任嘅主席亦唔應該故意拖延。

57
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,840
只係召開會議去選舉主政。

58
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,170
亦都要謹慎考慮是否行使呢啲權力。

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,910
具有一般權力，以處理內會嘅事務。

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,830
但行使依啲權力係受到一定嘅規範。

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,990
由於現任主席係新任主席嘅選舉嘅候選人，所以佢係無。

62
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,600
新主席嘅選舉，令到自己可以繼續擔任新會期嘅主席。

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,760
主席喺去年十月到而家都係去審慎去行使佢嘅主席嘅權力。

64
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:34,030
喺呢方面，外間資深嘅大律師同秘書處早前提供嘅意見咧，係並冇分歧嘅。

65
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,620
同埋議案。

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,830
郭議員。

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,390
係選舉主席。

68
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,170
郭榮亨議員。

69
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,970
並不相符。

70
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,530
喺選舉主席時。

71
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,100
所採用嘅方法。

72
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,110
資深大律師係認為。

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,080
喺正常嘅情況之下。

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,130
包括立法會大樓保安嘅安排。

75
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,940
然後接處理其他嘅事項。

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,670
新會期嘅首要處理嘅事務。

77
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,410
與內會主席選舉相關嘅事項。

78
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,750
難以係睇到如何。

79
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,400
與主持選舉議員嘅職能。

80
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,110
讓內會內務委員會啊討論多項。

81
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,670
已經屆滿。

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,550
同埋權力。

83
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,880
管核嘅事宜。

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,240
同埋執行嘅長程。

85
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,800
現任內會主席。

86
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,820
李慧瓊議員係有責任。

87
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,580
內會係無法處理。

88
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,720
都認為喺目前嘅情況之下。

89
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,900
立法會行政管理委員會。

90
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,250
秘書處同埋外間嘅資深大律師。

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,190
同埋多項冇約束力嘅意外。

92
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,210
期間有過百條嘅附屬法例嘅審議期。

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,330
由於內會係超過六個月，仲未選出主席。

94
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,880
現時已經係積壓咗十四條法案，二十多項附屬法例。

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,750
秘書處亦都就此曾向主持選舉嘅議員表達相同嘅意見。

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:36,090
委任中審法院首席法官嘅決議案，同埋多份法案委員會嘅報告係需要審議。

97
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,170
係有權。

98
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,850
以認知嘅問題。

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,380
大律師嘅法律意見。

100
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,640
來會延續。

101
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,900
因此喺目前嘅情況下。

102
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,280
嚴重積壓嘅工作。

103
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,510
現任內會主席李慧瓊議員。

104
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,960
交畀內會所有委員參考。

105
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,480
秘書處已經移備背景資料。

106
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,290
我今早已將外間之心。

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,310
使到立法會恢復正常嘅運作。

108
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,790
由於社會都十分關注內會嘅情況。

109
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,940
去處理因選舉主席出現過度言。

110
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,900
特別係處理重要或急切嘅事務。

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,190
亦都係有責去召開會議，去處理。

112
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,480
我亦都希望內會係盡快解決現時嘅困局。

113
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,360
參與。

114
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,150
從的past experience。

115
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,570
I would like to say a few words in English.

116
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,330
提供傳媒同公眾人士。

117
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,030
以及資深大律師就內會言。

118
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,700
主席選舉所提供嘅意見嘅要點。

119
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,210
作為House Committee has yet to elect its chairman.

120
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,830
and this has impeded the proper exercise.

121
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,400
啊！ sought the advice from outside senior councils.

122
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,070
Considering matters referred by the council.

123
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,000
of the constitutional functions of the Legislative Council.

124
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,100
Housecom is the most important committee of the council.

125
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,700
Preparing for business on the agenda of the council and consult.

126
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,310
但什麼發生在會期是 unprecedented。

127
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:34,990
on the relevant issues with the view to resolving the current deadlock as early as possible.

128
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:05,190
Housecom can usually conclude the election of his chairman and deputy chairman in one meeting.

129
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,860
是。

130
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,810
In property.

131
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,860
The implication.

132
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,640
at early this year.

133
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,810
on the operation of Housecom.

134
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,770
pending the election of its chairman.

135
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,530
Housecom has begun the process of.

136
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,520
The election of chairman within a short time.

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,980
The legal analysis made at the time was based.

138
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,440
Therefore, it is anticipated that Housecom could complete.

139
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,150
election of the chairman since the fifteenth of October last year.

140
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,160
on the ordinary course of events envisaged by Housecom.

141
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,340
我有監察，和， developments closely， and make repeated appeals.

142
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,970
and still failed to elect its chairman and deputy chairman by the end of the month.

143
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,730
as early as October last year, the secretary's legal adviser had explained in details.

144
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:18,940
regretably, after quite some time since last October, Housecom has not yet been able to elect its chairman.

145
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,690
在face of this novel.

146
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,290
so that the council can resume normal functioning.

147
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,070
therefore in late March, I have sought through the secretariat.

148
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,320
urging members to put aside their political differences.

149
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,790
啊！所以 now we receive advice from outside senior councils.

150
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,750
The exercise of such power is subject to certain caveat.

151
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,120
但Housecom still could not have its chairman elected at that meeting.

152
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,900
and complete the election of the House Home Chairman as soon as possible.

153
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,290
problem to let go. It is incumbent on me.

154
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:17,670
When Albert Esof, the incumbent Housecom chairman, called another meeting on the 13th of March.

155
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:14,040
The legal advice from outside senior councils on how to resolve the issues relating to Hong Kong.

156
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:09,600
However, the meeting were cancelled due eventually due to the severe situation of the COVID-19 outbreak.

157
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:59,980
作為主席，來識別一個解決方案，所以確保議會可以履行其憲法上的職責，有效地。

158
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:33,250
In summary, pending the election of the new chairman, while the incumbent House Com chairman should have all the usual powers to conduct the business of House Com.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:59,930
我 notice that the incumbent House Committee Chairman or the Honorary Starry Lee had arranged special meetings to speed up the election of the Chairman of the current session.

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:38,640
The failure of Housecom to function normally had rendered the council unable to properly perform its function, as stipulated in Article 73 of the Basic Law.

161
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,940
先喺康師傅。

162
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,490
電力公司。

163
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,890
as House Com chairman.

164
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,070
say that the way.

165
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,120
在普通嘅course of events。

166
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,260
他 allow House of Members to have.

167
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,710
The election of the Housecombe Chairman for the new sessions should be the first item of business.

168
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:33,520
Ahead of any business to be transacted in a new session.

169
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:37,130
The secretary has also expressed similar views to the presiding member.

170
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:46,510
and she or he should exercise caution as to whether to exercise the power.

171
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:18,060
matters under the purview of the Legislative Council Commission, as well as a number of non-binding motions.

172
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:06,310
discussed on a number of issues and motions covering the security arrangements and their implementation in.

173
00:12:49,730 --> 00:13:00,200
In this regard, senior council's advice is no different from the provided from that provided by the secretary earlier.

174
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:29,350
在 senior council's view， it is difficult to see how such discussion could be relevant to the election of the house committee chairman.

175
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:52,850
Honourable Dennis Kwok has contacted the election of chairman is inconsistent with the powers and functions of the presiding member.

176
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:16,140
since October last year, the incumbent House Com Chairman had has prudently exercised power as the Chairman in office, only to call meetings for purpose of electing the new Chairman.

177
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,560
問呢個？

178
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,230
係。

179
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,560
我公司。

180
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,060
嗯。

181
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,740
即係你誒。

182
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,230
追究嘅。

183
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,190
businesses.

184
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,380
啊！我哋打緊先，打緊先得啦～

185
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,820
has the responsibility.

186
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,460
and authority to deal with the problems.

187
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,900
especially transacting the urgent or essential.

188
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,670
Both the secretary and outside senior council are of the view that.

189
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,370
cause by the inordinate delay in the election of the chairman.

190
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:52,890
as the peasant in the peasant situation, the incumbent Housecom chairman, the honourable Starry Lee.

191
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:16,210
and make sure that there is no undue disruption to the work of Housecom and its normal or proper functioning.

192
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:40,210
Therefore, in the present situation, the incumbent House Com Chairmen, the honourable Starry, has both responsibilities and authority to deal with House Com's heavy backlog of work.

193
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,590
just.

194
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,010
比較有責。

195
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,020
election.

196
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,650
去處理。

197
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,540
So what what do you mean urgent letters?

198
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,900
畀曬來回。

199
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,220
嗱，第一樣嘢咧就係誒。

200
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,840
六個月內都未選到主席。

201
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,070
十幾號嘅事啊，發生咗啦，但係我係冇。

202
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
我參加法律議員之前嘅嘛，咁所以係冇問到依個問題。

203
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,630
啊，當然好明顯咧，就係現任嘅內會主席係有權。

204
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:49,180
各委員噉就等內會去尋求，自己去尋求一個解決方法。

205
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:39,420
問題暫時嘅問題，噉我亦都係頭先講咗，我就會將所有嘅法律意見。

206
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:31,470
我問嘅誒法律意見咧，係去尋求點樣去解決內會依個誒？

207
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:17,340
積下嚟嘅緊急事項，咁所以依個就係要內會去處理，因為我講咗畀你，我係三月尾已經開始尋找法律意見，咁四月。

208
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:43,560
Sort of larger matters should Starry be tackling? Are you talking about things like the national anthem law? And then second question being, are you saying basically that Starry should assume as chairman?

209
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
你 know。

210
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,710
是。

211
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,070
四。

212
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,230
sorry。

213
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,940
We have.

214
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,120
fourteen。

215
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,010
Apart from.

216
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,420
因為Flashpoint將要 wrap up in。

217
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,290
但，after six months。

218
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,090
Also, what sorts of powers?

219
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,240
In a prudent manner.

220
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,780
need to exercise her power.

221
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,260
The election is. Is are you saying that the election is not going to happen?

222
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,350
is still the incumbent House Chairman.

223
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,350
It's very simple. I did not.

224
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,990
From the new legal advisory update, what sort of powers does Starry have? Can you elaborate?

225
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,330
但係。

226
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,530
資產份。

227
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,670
就啲散。

228
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,840
bills.

229
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,650
零一等等。

230
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,360
依家即係根據。

231
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,720
翁，咩？

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,340
啊！誒。

233
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,010
Is that urgent?

234
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,960
嘅意見同埋你決定之後咧，李慧瓊係咪可以決定喺？

235
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,450
I think it was up to members and the public.

236
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,920
And we also have the appointment of chief chief justice. The resolution there.

237
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:48,540
Housecom， and another twenty something， you know， subsidiary legislation there。

238
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:23,610
我問你，你

239
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:32,330
I haven't I haven't say anything. It'll be up to the Housecom to decide how they handle.

240
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:58,290
also，we have missed the chance of looking scrutinise over a hundred subsidiary legislation.

241
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,050
係。

242
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,960
定嗰個議程。

243
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,290
主席嘅特別。

244
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,060
李慧瓊可能會。

245
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,690
擔唔擔心，即係。

246
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,420
嘅決定會唔會擔心佢？

247
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,630
之後係可以處理平時內。

248
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,200
之外，係咪可以展開另一個門檻？

249
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,840
做到一啲百缺嘅挑戰咧。誒。

250
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,330
第二就係誒，除咗李慧如，除咗決定召開特別。

251
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,670
知深大藏嘅意見係清晰嘅。

252
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,030
噉我亦都畀咗內會咁多位成員啦。

253
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,010
平時內會處理嘅線路咧，咁會唔會擔心就係衍生咗另一個箱包區嘅話？

254
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,800
另外就係啱誒嗰個法律文件都提到，就係誒現任嘅內管處長可能有機會濫用嘅。

255
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:40,140
咁點樣去處理咧？我相信佢哋有集體嘅智慧去解決現時呢一個誒。

256
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:53,880
處理嘅選舉問題，或者係我哋有緊急嘅事係要做嘅問題，誒等等嘅咧，佢哋應該係誒用佢嘅正常方法應該處理到。

257
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,010
誒。

258
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,450
但係話選選。

259
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,140
嗯。

260
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
取消計劃又話。

261
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,130
未消決完就係呢一個就。

262
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
就在於可以另外整一個會議要。

263
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,950
我想問翻嚟就點樣定義緊急事項係由你為？

264
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,810
如果你留頭先留心聽咧。

265
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,590
我就想問下咧，頭先頭咁講法啦，即係話其實而家李慧瓊嗰個。

266
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,760
你內會嘅時候係咪意味住內會嗰個選主席嘅程序會各自？

267
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,510
另外就想問翻就係噉，如果噉嘅情況下，噉佢要召開另一場會議。

268
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,930
立法會嘅意見當然係一個普通嘅情況裏邊。

269
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,600
誒，內會點樣去行使個權力？點樣去處理個選舉，同埋點樣？

270
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:37,170
誒內會主席去運用嘅權力，召開會議去處理啊啲緊急事項咧，噉我覺得都係由內會佢自己去啊決定。

271
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:15,150
去解釋啦，咁但係過咗六個月，依個情況就當然唔係普通啦。咁所以點解我哋去尋求一個法律意見，去睇睇有咩辦法可以解決現時嘅？

272
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:30,520
難題啊！如果係普通嘅就已經冇事啦，已經選咗主席啦噉樣。咁所以個問題出現就係依六個月嘅啊拉布或者六個月嘅啊個主持人嘅。

273
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,950
係。

274
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,400
係。

275
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,140
比食貨。

276
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,790
嗯。

277
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,040
但。

278
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,540
係咪？

279
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,590
你之前都係講。

280
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,870
呃，The prudence.

281
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,720
If you look at the ROP.

282
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,300
In calling meetings.

283
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,860
Starry is still the incumbent.

284
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,550
誒，the election of the new chairman is important.

285
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,570
now after one week, two week, a month or two months, she can still exercise.

286
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,800
But if it is after six months, and you have a lot of urgent businesses.

287
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:12,710
I think the important thing is that under normal circumstances.

288
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:45,200
個表現咧係令到誒我係需要尋求外界嘅法律意見，去睇下有咩方法去解決現時嘅困局。

289
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,180
怕。

290
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,280
公司入。

291
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,980
貨。

292
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,070
under that.

293
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,280
好嘛，OK，唔該曬。

294
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,630
Jointly advise, affirm.

295
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,730
The senior councils.

296
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,210
look at, there are so many bills.

297
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,110
並不是一個執法嘅部門。

298
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,690
technical，啊，to。

299
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,260
that she have that power to do it.

300
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,470
Could she exercise her power?

301
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:00,110
So many other issues that we need to look at, then.

302
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:26,880
所以你 can call a meeting to look at urgent businesses for the household.

303
00:24:47,200 --> 00:25:00,950
依個唔係喺我問我哋嘅法律嘅意見啊之中，咁究竟佢依個點樣咧？噉你要問問執法部門誒點樣去處理啦，因為我。
