1
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,080
誒。

2
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,730
誒疑慮。

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
委員會處理。

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,240
尹兆堅議員。

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,390
有冇議員想發言？

6
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,710
會會恢復二零一九年。

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,180
主席，誒，本人想就住二零一九年。

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,370
發言表達我嘅關注同埋當中一啲嘅。

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,330
誒運貨貨運安全修訂條例草案咧。

10
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,950
貨運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案二讀辯論。

11
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:14,520
誒所需嘅標記嘅資料咧，提出一個新嘅規定。第二咧就係統一貨櫃牌照上嘅計量用詞單位，統一佢。第三咧就係修訂貨櫃結構安全嗰個測試程序。

12
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,390
誒。

13
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
嗯。

14
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
誒。

15
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,650
首先咧。

16
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,300
幾個大嘅問題。

17
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,910
誒就住。

18
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,660
當公啊，sorry啊，主席，我睇到，因為我呢度跳緊幾份文件去去解演譯我嗰個資料啊。

19
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,110
誒好啊！我試下舉一個實際例子，可能大家噉係容易明白一一啲我講緊乜嘢。

20
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:05,230
誒呢啲噉嘅集裝箱喺運送嘅過程中會帶嚟風險咧，咁其實真係係值得關注嘅。不過我覺得而家佢大劑嘅地方喺邊度咧？

21
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:35,070
誒簡單講講咩叫單門營運程，我就講咗啦。噉就係誒有啲情況下係唔可以關曬兩隻門啦，係咪？咁但係正正因為咁咧，根據附則二入邊咧，如果有集裝箱其中一隻門拆咗咧，

22
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:19,260
所以我真係唔詳細去討論啦，但係咧有啲重點係要講嘅，就單門營運呢個部分咧，其實好值得我哋關注同埋討論嘅。噉就我一陣間會誒嘗試解釋一下點解我關注，主要係喺草案嘅內容誒第五、六、八、九條納入嗰度。

23
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:41,330
附表同埋附則啊，最大嘅差異嗰度，第一，誒，我哋比較嘗試比較翻附則二啊，同埋附表一啦。其實主要咧係有三樣嘅誒實質差異嘅。第一樣咧就係附則二咧新增咗一個咧叫做誒general provision同埋introduction嘅部分啦。噉就誒。

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:01:00,800
成語文件所講啦，有關嘅總嘅目的咧，其實係因為誒國際海事組織咧喺二零一零年同埋二零一三年咧喺國際誒集裝箱安全公約方面咧通過咗一啲嘅決議，其中包括咗就一咧就係就住貨櫃嘅牌照上咧。

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:35,110
噉就誒立法建議係包括咩？我簡略講一講嘅啫。跟住後邊咧，我就講我覺得就住條文嘅技術上出現咗幾個比較重大嘅缺陷，可能引起日後嘅誒更大喺立法上邊嘅情況，所以我必須係而家講一講。誒立法嘅建議其實簡單咁講，正話嗰個概括。

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:55,120
簡單講就係第一就係為免嗰個貨櫃喺運輸途中嘅時候誒倒塔啊，或者係誒破損咧，噉就條例草案規定咧誒堆碼同埋咧誒推拉能力有限嘅貨櫃咧，佢嘅牌照上面咧需要畫一顯眼咁寫明標記，噉就簡單咁避免意外啫，容易識別嘅啫。

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:15,130
咁第二咧喺某啲特殊嘅情況之下咧，貨櫃喺裝卸、堆碼或者係運輸嘅過程中咧，有一扇門係會打開嘅。咁呢個我我唔喺度詳細解釋啦。咁誒簡單講，有啲貨物係需要噉嘅，例如空氣流通啲啊等等，例如榴蓮啊噉樣。咁為確保此等經過改裝嘅貨，

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:35,140
櫃喺運作同埋安全嘅結構上邊咧，係可以做到好咧。條例草案定明咧，該等貨櫃嘅新測試程序同埋牌照上咧一啲誒標記嘅規定噉樣。誒第三咧就為咗利便國際間運輸貨櫃嘅時候咧，條例草案咧就規定咗貨櫃嘅牌照上面標示嘅尺寸同埋單位咧，必須同埋國際單位咧。

29
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:55,150
統一制式咁呢個好合理啊！咁有關嘅改動咧，包括咗誒質量同埋咧重量上邊嘅詞匯噉樣。最後一個咧就係由於國際海事組織不時更新更新呢啲噉嘅公約啊、技術上嘅要求啊，咁條例組案咧呢個就緊要啦，就賦權咗一樣嘢，就咧用直接提述嘅方法將公約嘅內容。

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:15,160
要求納入法例，仲直接提述嘅方式。咁假如喺多項誒修訂中廢除咗現有條例下邊嘅附表咧，改以一個誒合符公約嘅附則取代。好啦，我呢度用咗幾分鐘兩分零鐘啫。點解要匆匆講一講呢個位咧？主席，我睇見有。

31
00:03:41,610 --> 00:04:01,620
同埋喺現有貨櫃測試入邊咧，新新增咗單門運作啊，即係我只係提及咧，即係拆咗一隻門，但係一樣擺貨，跟住運送咁所謂one door off operation嘅測試部分點測試法咁咧，新增嘅頭兩部分咧，其實涉及咗啲測試力學嘅定義嘅。

32
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,060
係諗唔明嘅地方。

33
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,630
我哋又點解？

34
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,630
如果淨係有一條法例喺度，但係其實現實中咧，現實世界係冇變化嘅。

35
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,730
佢又有闊面嘅，即係我唔明嘅地方就係噉樣，即係佢原本。

36
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,300
係咩咧？我覺得最需要關注嘅咧，就係兩樣嘢，一個咧就係睇翻誒。

37
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,240
修訂條文入邊附表二嘅主席，附表二嘅二啊，就要堆碼同埋誒。

38
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:44,630
推拉能力有限嘅貨櫃咧，佢寫咗一個誒新嘅規則入邊嘅，咁咧就係適用於咧喺。

39
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:08,670
咁其實你改唔改得喎？咁但係呢個唔係我立論點啊，唔係話既然改唔改得，唔好改，唔係咁講，唔好誤會咗先嚇，我唔係噉嘅意思。

40
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:53,600
符合以下説明嘅貨櫃就係咧，誒堆堆碼值少於誒十九萬二千公斤，或者咧。

41
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:03,170
誒推拉值少於一百五十千牛頓嘅嘅狀況之下，就可就係可以噉樣，但係佢又好奇怪嗰啲值。

42
00:06:47,910 --> 00:07:00,200
咁輕易要同意去修訂咧？而當然啦，如果冇所謂噉啊，畀佢過。其實現現實中啊，主席呢條條例咧，正我提到一開場講咗啦，其實七年都冇改到㗎，現實中行緊㗎。

43
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:22,960
但係，我想講，其實呢度似乎係一種好形式主義嘅，就係話因為公約改咗，我咪跟住改咯。但係佢竟然唔知道咧，自己掘咗幾個大氹出嚟，依個好大喎，主席。

44
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:39,660
嗱，我哋問嗰啲誒業界嘅朋友啦，單門營運其實咧係好常見嘅。誒，我就係提到譬如流運送一啲要通風啊嘅嘅貨物噉樣，例如誒榴蓮噉樣啦。誒，業界亦都講咧，好多時佢哋咧其實完成咗特定嘅程序咧，需要拆隻門。

45
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:55,360
就會令到集裝箱嘅承受力啊，誒嗰個扭曲力減少，呢個好明顯，明白啊！大家係咪佢因為個貨櫃如果閂曬門，誒佢係有六邊嘅嘛，應該嚇咁咧。但係其中一道門開咗，咁個扭力就會有變化嘅咯。咁到底呢個噉嘅變化會唔會導致咗誒喺？

46
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:59,950
嘅貨運之後咧，佢哋又會裝翻上去嘅，噉就可以係誒誒成個流程就係噉樣嘅嗱。我唔清楚呢種噉嘅做法咧係咪好普遍，不過根據而家嗰個貨櫃誒唔好講，貨運貨櫃安全條例咧，其實任何貨櫃改裝都係要得到海事處嘅批准嘅喎。咁而家啲。

47
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:19,960
呢種單門營運嘅模式之下，呢種臨時拆裝貨櫃單門嘅動作，其實算唔算係改裝咧？噉樣誒，係咪每次拆門裝門都要經過有關嘅批准咧？而更加實際嘅問題係咧，好可能咧有一啲物流公司咧臨時先至接到呢啲噉嘅。

48
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,400
好易嘅規定喎。

49
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,510
咁嗱，最後啦。

50
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,610
咁但係喺執法嘅時候，海事處又點樣識別？

51
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,700
咁而咧，我啱啱提到依點啊，就奇怪啲嘅在。

52
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,070
佢係豁免咗二零一零，亦即係二零一四年之前啊！

53
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,070
呢個方便，我估當然係有啲技術嘅原因嘅方便啦，可能行內會清楚一啲啊。

54
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,440
噉啊，好奇怪啦！所以可以咁講，咁點解二零一四年之前嘅貨櫃有豁免嘅咧？

55
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,470
誒係要修定而家嗰個誒貨運貨櫃安全條例第二十七條一啊。

56
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,540
係因為拉力嘅問題，種種原因，但係佢又豁免二零一四年嗰啲嘅喎。

57
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:50,330
就咁憑肉眼睇，點樣識別某啲貨櫃係咪二零一四年年之前建造或者未經更改咧？

58
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:26,320
我即係唔唔係第一花你時間，主席最後一個點，依個就又係好奇怪嘅，草案第十條。

59
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:51,900
嘅貨櫃咧，原來係有一啲豁免嘅，佢又條文草案第七條提出喺展示安全合格牌照嘅規定嘅時候咧，如果該貨櫃喺二零一四年七月一號之前咧，

60
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:28,850
即係話，我就係提到，即係話嗰個橋口嘅一十九萬二千公斤嗰個誒堆拉馬，同埋咧一千五百千牛頓嗰個嘅推拉值，係真係堆拉馬同推拉值啊！大家聽翻文言。

61
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:28,420
即係世事本無世上本無事，咁當然國際公約改咗，你個責任上係要改嘅。不過其實你一路冇改嘅時候咧，其實佢都係咁運作緊嘅。你亦都冇乜能力咧。就算你改咗咧，我都睇唔到你有咩能力，你係可以真係好似你所講咁有效管制監管，做得到啲咩嘢？

62
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:39,970
誒貨品呢類特殊要單門運作嘅誒誒嘅order嚇，如果有公司喺拆門裝門嘅過程中啊，就係拆咗只門，海事處又其實又點樣可以知道或者巡查得到咧？即係天大地大，你如何係可以執行到呢條法例咧？噉樣即係我我係。

63
00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:12,190
完成建造，即係喺呢個日期之前整好㗎啦，即係誒個櫃做咗出嚟㗎，而又未曾經過結構上有改裝咧，就可以根據今次條例草案生效前附表二嘅規定，即係我啱啱讀嘅誒，去到展示牌照而唔需要咧，根據新法例附表。

64
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,620
同埋咧。

65
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,870
就係究竟。

66
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,340
所以我想問嘅。

67
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,630
日後。

68
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,650
黑洞嚟個主席。

69
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,630
可以施行本條例。

70
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,170
係咪用翻今次草案咁？

71
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,390
咁咪好大禍！呢個黑洞嚟喎。

72
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,720
咁咧，用咗上面草案文字代替咗嗱。

73
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,510
仲未完喎，呢個黑洞帶嚟嘅問題仲有一點啦，仲大劑。呢個同本會嘅。

74
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:40,410
提到嘅係咩咧？為咗全面或者局部實施以下國際協議而定立規例。

75
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:11,860
憲政上或者嗰個權力有關，就係如果今次法例通過咗，對於日後定立嘅規例咧，會有啲咩影響咧？

76
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:27,820
實施適用於香港嘅公約嘅任何條文而訂立規則，上面修訂嘅係將條例和之後嘅字句全部刪除。

77
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:12,450
修訂啲版本為準，咁因為呢啲噉嘅英譯嘅中文好難明，我簡單咁講，等睇緊電視市民明白。而家廿七一條咧列明咗一樣嘢，就係局長咧。

78
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:51,430
局方用咩準則？點樣決定某啲國際公約條文係咪適用於香港？根據你呢個寫法，而局長又以咩原則同埋標準點樣決定全面或者局部實施？

79
00:09:50,980 --> 00:10:10,990
係咪好奇怪啊，主席？即係佢搞咗一大輪，其實咧，我一路講過嚟每一個我關注嘅環節，其實佢改咗都係冇辦法監管或者做到任何嘢，而更奇怪，佢有種自相矛盾就係點解佢講到國際公約呢個部分咁重要，佢要跟住去改，因為安全嘅問題。

80
00:10:40,690 --> 00:11:00,700
國際海事組織通過嘅關於貨運貨櫃安全嘅國際協議，而凡不是有對該協議作出任何修改或修訂，而該等修改或修訂適用於香港，則以該協議經該等修改或修。

81
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,120
誒。

82
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,120
嘅。

83
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,820
誒。

84
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,050
代以負責。

85
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,110
咁咧就廢除咗附表一。

86
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,730
咁日後提交扶例。

87
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,840
二，如果我哋用負。

88
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,980
影響咗本會咧，就住立法嘅時候可以作出。

89
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,560
死板甚至無從修改咧，而其實咁咧係好大件事係。

90
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:09,690
功能監管同埋咧修訂啊！大家睇下文誒附例入邊睇先啊！我睇翻個reference係。

91
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:59,940
噉我哋咪即係硬食咯！你用咗呢種呢個唔係特快批係啦，直接提述嘅方式，噉就 bypass 咗立法會嗰度。

92
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:48,710
進展當然啦，佢又梗係快快靚正添啦。而呢種直接提出嘅方式咧，又會唔會變相令到法例或者符例欠缺咗彈性？

93
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:24,820
五六八九條都係寫明係咩咧？我舉一個例子，你見到啊，主席。佢五六八九都係咁寫嘅，就係定定第五條。譬如第五就係定定第五條貨櫃的個別批准。

94
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:17,330
跟住咧，任有關條文，我哋必須要硬食。而無論我哋認為，正話我提及局長嘅判斷係合理定唔合理，有冇符合相關原則，總之你就可以照做。咁呢個係我自己對於整個。

95
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:51,260
表嘅方式咧，我哋都仲可以咧，係提出一啲嘅。如果我認為係唔適當或者適當，可以有一啲嘅意見或者修改。但係而家佢咪行咗特快通道，用負責嘅形式，而負責正正你睇翻文件就係就係國際公約嘅內文條文喎。

96
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:35,460
誒，只要佢認為符合咗賦予咗改例之後啊，賦予局長呢個權力之後，係咪佢認為有關嘅國際公約入邊，佢認為喺我正係質疑佢唔知咩準則標準嘅情況下，唔知係全部定局部嘅情況下，局長係可以用直接提述嘅方式嚟到立法喎？

97
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,120
幾年 ago。

98
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,080
毛孟靜議員。

99
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,750
誒結構性。

100
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,760
噉我覺得呢個係一個好大問題。噉啊，本人僅此陳詞，提出少少嘅意見，睇下希望同事都回應。下唔該，主席。

101
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,930
Now I quite clearly remembered that particular.

102
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:25,320
條例喺技術上咧嘅一啲唔清晰嘅部分，或者就算佢認為之清晰，但係帶嚟咗一個。

103
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:56,140
係無從監管有關嘅做法係咪正確，或或者提出我哋嘅意見？咁其實等於冇審核嘅喎。

104
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:41,890
previous tycoons like Sir Y K Pao, he was one of the those who managed to

105
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:18,940
When it comes to doing a container businesses, and another improper thing I have raised at the economic development panel was that.

106
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:06,940
Even Ningbo has taken over Hong Kong. I think Ningbo ranks the sixth, and Hong Kong somewhere somewhere around the eighth.

107
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:55,360
sort of delve Hong Kong into the world international world of financial business. Another sad thing is, at the moment, it's obvious to everyone.

108
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:51,670
經濟發展 panel meeting when this was raised, I actually mentioned the fact that why are we so fast slipping away from the world's top list of container ports?

109
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:48,040
嘅影響，而似乎咧喺成個過程中冇人提及到嘅。主席，我覺得最尾嗰點附表變成咧代爾負責咧，係一個好大好大嘅缺陷，令到本會咧喺日後面對同樣情況之下咧，除咗開壞咗先例，誒見咗一個直接提上方式處理之外咧，我哋。

110
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:26,300
We're discussing this freight container safety amendment bill, two thousand and nineteen, which actually had gone run past the legislative panel on economic development back in November, two thousand and eighteen. That's exactly two years.

111
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,250
south。

112
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,400
container ship。

113
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,260
或West，when it comes to freight。

114
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:53,910
mechanical, I mean, essentially mechanical, right? And there's not not much to

115
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:55,490
not be actual equivalence. And another thing is in paragraph eight, a.

116
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:26,100
Carrying any controversy, I understand. Except that there are in the bill a couple of rather curious.

117
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:13,430
The stink! I, I knew I might be a bit off the topic, but might as well say it, because things have gone quite so.

118
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:26,210
capacity， I can easily understand what stacking is. We'll stack up things, right? And you talk about capacity. Now, capacity.

119
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:15,210
Such containers, maintenance, examination and control. It's all for the sake of safe transportation. Okay, fine. This shouldn't be a

120
00:15:51,950 --> 00:16:11,960
When I was young, Hong Kong was certainly one of the world's top container ports for a long time, second only to Rotterdam. So I raised this question at the panel, and of course I got easily.

121
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:31,970
brushed off, and this is very sad for Hong Kong, because when it comes to economic development, Hong Kong actually transformed itself from a fishing village to this huge container port business, thanks partly to

122
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:42,690
the the business it's it's a huge business and it should have been one of the lifelines of Hong Kong economy. Then why is it that it's come under only the transport and housing bureau, mind you, transport

123
00:17:42,690 --> 00:18:02,700
Transport and housing, two major sectors, all lumped together, and then the shipping and container business would only come under transport, i.e., a quarter of the bureau's assets. This is just not right. Now you don't have to give me that.

124
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:40,550
containers business in Hong Kong, I will come back to this freight containers thing. Of course, we're focusing on safety. Now, safety, the the focuses on the actual testing and inspecting of the.

125
00:18:40,550 --> 00:19:00,560
And the idea basically is to uniform, to unify, to standardise the requirements for such tests and inspections. The thing is, the second part is to describe the procedures of.

126
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,090
It also says that.

127
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,330
但also，also。

128
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,940
also paragraph eight.

129
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,040
In some subsequent paragraphs.

130
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,450
The point C, the now.

131
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:24,940
dimensions and units. Now in Chinese, units, it's just units. But dimensions, suddenly it becomes tek chun.

132
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:22,440
the even more the popular sort of popping up term is維道，維，right？It's維他奶個維嚇，道就係道數個道。

133
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:46,390
The linguistic and semantic points I would like to raise, and I wish the official in charge could give us some satisfactory explanation. Things about the stacking, loading and lifting of containers. You would think it's all very.

134
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:14,400
explain about, but then in the legislative brief point paragraph A, sorry eight the paragraph eight part A it says specifications for containers with limited stacking capacity. Now stacking

135
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:46,510
In Chinese becomes lung leg, and that's what really baffled me. Capacity would be talking about volumes and the strength, the force of something. Lung leg in Chinese would mean more like abilities, and they might.

136
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:18,380
All right, we're going to have everything in a standardised manner, and so that these containers can be easily identified and so on. But they are also, they're actually talking about containers with limited stacking. What I was saying.

137
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:38,390
Stacking capacity, right? The stacking fine, all racking capacity. Now that again, that made me wonder why. I mean, what's main difference between stacking and racking? I did read the Chinese version.

138
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:58,400
I think I've got a sense to over what this is really about. What I'm trying to ask is why is stacking capacity mentioned as it is, and this racking capacity is only added after.

139
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:33,140
You were trying to conform to international standards, right? So fine, and this bill now requires that the physical dimensions and units marked on the SAPs, the SAPs being the safety or whatnot, you know, the the proven.

140
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,000
exempted.

141
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,810
and。

142
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:39,410
need to give exemptions to when it comes to new regulations.

143
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:13,590
my last, my very last, the point is that when it comes to the

144
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:03,330
Requirements is that the case? Is a huge volume of such a thing? Now.

145
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:15,300
when I say維道is better，because the three dimensions would mean三維唔係唔係身體嘅三維嚇，而係啊維啊啊啲啊。

146
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:52,480
Because they're always the technical and compassionate grounds you need to get, but then still, I wish the

147
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:49,410
many of our old ordinances, so we might as well get things right from the start at this time. Now, the bill itself, in paragraph 10.

148
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:53,150
Labels right of containers be aligned with the international system of units. Okay, it would go as meticulous as changing weight into mass. Now I also I'm not good at physics, but I understand why weight is

149
00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:13,160
No good, but mass is much more specific. Fine. What I'm trying to alert you is that you mentioned physical dimensions and units. Now, dimensions and units are both very neutral terms, meaning

150
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:45,270
In Chinese， and I was slightly baffled. I thought we're all going after the metric system, right? We talk about not in miles. We don't say miles anymore. Well, we're not supposed to. We do kilometres. Things like that. We don't measure our height in how.

151
00:23:45,320 --> 00:24:05,330
Many feet and inches. We usually talk about how many centimetres when it comes to a body height. So, I did look it up in a dictionary. What's dimension in Chinese? Eh? It does say 標準

152
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:42,750
And I thought that would be a much more appropriate, because I know in Chinese, teck chun would mean the actual size of something. But then literally, teck is a foot, chun is an inch, and for it to I mean dimension in English would.

153
00:24:42,750 --> 00:25:02,760
be fairly inappropriate, I should think, and so I would invite you to have a second thought on that because when we say three dimensional something, right in Chinese, it would mean lab type. You you wouldn't say something like tek chun, and

154
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:35,660
Whitey, all white. That's much more appropriate. And please don't think I'm the picking on language and things, because you knew about our miscellaneous omnibus legislation, correcting all the old and improper language in our.

155
00:25:50,070 --> 00:26:10,080
What did you say? The safety approved plate SAP, SEP, as a container which did not undergo structural modifications and whose construction was completed before July the first, 2014, would be.

156
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:32,310
Now I I don't quite understand this. It's a didn't use the word exempted. It says would not be subject to the new requirements of Seps as provided blah blah in the now amended ordinance. Fine. I mean of course we always.

157
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,290
主席。

158
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,100
again.

159
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,060
梁繼昌議員，你乜嘢規程問題？

160
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,800
梁繼昌議員要求點算法定人數？

161
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,530
我發言係支持二零一九年。

162
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,110
你嘅發言時間到啦。

163
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,880
根據議事規則，十七個户三啊，請你點算法定人數？

164
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,490
運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案恢復二讀嘅辯論。

165
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,120
This in Chinese，this 拍，long， it's the

166
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:14,990
會議法定人數已夠，請議員返回座位，會議繼續。易志明議員。

167
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:47,480
I thought Zup is quality and Leng is quantity, and all of a sudden the way you

168
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:31,690
actually boxes right this box when it's unladen it's we we need to talk about its tar t a r e it would mean when it's actually empty it's not loaded but

169
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:13,110
Authorities in charge would explain just a bit more clearly whether such containers, these old exempted containers, are they still being in use, or they've been retired, or they could be used for something else.

170
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:33,120
Or what exactly does it mean? And is there any number reference? Is it a very common phenomenon that the say up to the half of the containers being dealt with in Hong Kong of this.

171
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:53,130
very old category that it's been constructed before July the first two thousand and fourteen and and they fail to undergo any structural modifications and as a result it they shouldn't they wouldn't be subject to the new

172
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:33,880
Both wording itself and paragraph. Let's see. Yes, clause you call it you call it clause, right? Number three. This is a curious word that says tear. T A R E. I have to confess.

173
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:53,890
我 confess，我從來都未見過這個字，所以我又查了一下，看它到底什麼意思。我先查了中文，它寫皮重，皮係皮膚嘅皮，哈，皮重。

174
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:13,900
t a r e就係以某貨櫃而言咧，係呢個貨櫃喺空櫃狀況時嘅質量。No，啊，the the質量嚇。So it simply means unladen weight. That's a container. Containers啊，If

175
00:29:48,030 --> 00:30:08,040
describe this that would would seem very baffling to a layman. But of course, this is a technical bill essentially, and it's conforming to some new revised international standards. And I understand you you.

176
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:46,090
條例草案目的係修訂運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例第五百零六章，以實施國際海事組織通過咗嘅《國際雜裝箱安全公約》中有關貨櫃測試、檢查、批准、保養以及管制程序嘅最新修訂。

177
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,340
以遠洋貨櫃船嚟運載。

178
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,340
香港港口係全球最繁忙嘅貨櫃港之一。

179
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,340
而符合特定條件嘅貨櫃係會獲得認可機構發出牌照。

180
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,530
航運係屬於國際性質嘅業務，全球有八成嘅貨運係經水路嚟運輸嘅。

181
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,930
國際海事組織係會按實際嘅需要，不時噉樣修訂以及更新公約嘅條文。

182
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:58,150
不過，因為多項嘅條例嘅職責喺上一個立法年度係冇足夠嘅時間完成條例草案嘅審議。

183
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:50,120
每星期有大概三百班輪係經過誒香港，服務連接全球四百二十個嘅目的地。

184
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:59,790
每年港口處理大概二千萬個標準貨櫃箱，因此香港嘅法規有必要係同國際嘅標準一致。

185
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:49,370
但係條例草案亦都已經拖延至到今年嘅七月，先至能夠再提交去立法會恢復誒輪候恢復二讀嘅辯論。

186
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:08,750
由於新冠狀病毒嘅爆發，考慮到感染嘅風險，政府係決定取消九月嘅立法會換屆選舉。

187
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:12,020
當局早喺去年嘅二零一九年十月十一日已經就條例草案刊登咗憲報，其後喺十月二十三日提交立法會首讀。

188
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:39,560
由於條例草案所建議嘅修訂好大程度係屬技術性質嘅，最終亦都冇議員特別要求成立小組委員會審議有關嘅條例。

189
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:08,360
因此，為咗確保用於國際運輸嘅貨櫃安全，國際海事組織係透過《國際雜裝箱安全公約》訂立貨櫃嘅安全標準。

190
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:20,870
而喺第六屆嘅立法會會期則延長一年，令到呢條條例草案能夠喺今日有機會係恢復議讀，立法程序不至於要推倒重來。

191
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:36,900
香港雖然唔係國際海事組織一百七十四個聯合國嘅成員國，但係香港作為組織嘅附屬會員，係有義務透過自行立法落實公約嘅新規定。

192
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:27,550
但係，因為上一年度嘅立法會會期遲遲未能夠選出內務委員會嘅主席，而令議員一直唔唔能夠決定是否需要成立小組委員會審議有關條例草案。

193
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,350
而有所言誤。

194
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,810
因此，除咗今日提到嘅國際雜裝箱安全公約。

195
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:26,790
港水域嘅遠洋貨櫃船，佢哋所載嘅貨櫃都已經係符合公約嘅最新要求。

196
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:33,270
國際海事組織不時都會就確保海上安全、防止海洋污染等提出新嘅規定。

197
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:52,820
所擁有或者管理嘅雙船船隊，更佔全球雙船總載重量噸誒噸位超過九嘅percent。

198
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:43,080
而研究將呢啲國際海事組織嘅最新要求納入本地嘅法例，確實係相當費時，以及係浩瀚嘅工作。

199
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:20,850
國際海事組織係一個促進各國政府同各國航運業界喺改進海上安全、防止海洋污染以及海事技術合作嘅國際組織。

200
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:59,520
相關修訂條例亦都要經過幾年，先至能夠正式係納入本地法例。可以見本地嘅法例同國際要求，實際上係有嚴重滯後之年。

201
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:51,390
好多時，國際海事組織建議嘅新規定雖然已經生效咗一段時間，但係特區政府卻遲遲未能夠將有關新規定納入喺本地嘅法例。

202
00:47:51,670 --> 00:48:05,560
今日提出嘅修訂係針對公約嘅兩項新規定：一堆放能力有限嘅貨櫃所需符合嘅規格，及二安全合格牌照上採用或一尺寸同埋單位。

203
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:08,010
如果香港嘅法規未能同國際嘅規定一致性，情況絕不理想。因此，特區政府係有必要加快相關嘅立法程序，令到本地法例緊貼國際海事組織嘅規定。

204
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:44,130
但係，香港作為國際航運中心之一，係世界第四大船泊嘅註冊地。現時有大概二千四百多艘遠洋船泊喺香港註冊，涉及一億二千九百萬噸。香港嘅船東同船泊管理公司。

205
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:38,660
海運業界對於呢啲旨在將國際海事組織嘅最新規定納入本地法例嘅建議，一向係冇乜異議嘅，反而認為特區政府喺將呢啲國際新規定納入本地法例嘅進度有所滯後。

206
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:25,850
國際海事組織海上委員會早喺二零一零年嘅十二月，以及二零一三年嘅六月係決議通過呢啲議案，並且喺二零一二以及二零一四年已經係全球生效，但係香港嘅法例一直就未作相應嘅修訂。

207
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:45,940
特區政府咧曾就有關新規定喺二零一六年十二月至到二零一八年嘅五月期間諮詢咗本地嘅相關團體，但係亦都要到咗今日先至能夠將新規定納入本地法例嘅立法程序，去到最後嘅階段。就算唔計去年立法會大塞車。

208
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:19,880
雖然被納入本地法例嘅國際新標準及規定早已喺全球實施，而行走世界各地不同港口嘅遠洋貨櫃船，亦都已經係充分得悉有關新嘅要求。就算有關新要求還未成為本地嘅法例，現時進入香港。

209
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,390
主席。

210
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,080
恢復議讀辯論。

211
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,710
誒，主席。

212
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,240
將就你。

213
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,110
張超雄議員。

214
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:28,980
貨運貨櫃安全修訂條例草案嘅議讀嘅。

215
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,990
我發言咧係反對今次嘅有關二零一九年。

216
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,410
嘅貨櫃就大概有一千四百萬個標準箱，亦都較二零一八年咧係下跌咗百分之八。

217
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:37,510
啊，主席誒，想點一點法定人數先？點解張超雄議員要求點算法定人數？

218
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:12,280
能夠喺切實可行嘅情況之下，盡量與時並進，緊貼國際海事組織所定下嘅最新要求。

219
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:05,640
緊密聯係世界各地嘅同埋覆蓋廣泛嘅班輪服務網絡，貨運方面仍然係具有一定嘅競爭力。

220
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:39,500
誒呢一條條例草案目的咧，當然都係將而家香港嘅一啲法例咧，同國際公約咧係相吻合。

221
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:56,220
截至至到今年嘅八月，港口嘅吞吐量累計仲要比舊年同期再下跌百分之四，但係香港嘅優越地理位置、自由港嘅政策、高效率嘅貨物處理。

222
00:50:43,360 --> 00:51:03,370
既然呢啲國際要求嘅內容都清楚同埋具體，亦都已經係畀其他嘅國家所接受，政府喺本地法例中直接提述有關國際新規定呢個嘅做法，自由黨係支持嘅，亦都有助加快立法嘅程序，令本地法例。

223
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:33,680
近年中美貿易戰及全球新冠狀病毒嘅爆發，導致到本港嘅貨櫃吞吐量係有所下降。二零一九年香港嘅港口吞吐量只係有一千八百幾萬個標準箱，較二零一八年下跌咗百分之六點六，已經攤充貨櫃碼頭處理嘅。

224
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:25,930
但係，我仍然期望行政長官預計喺十一月底宣讀嘅施政報告，會就進一步鞏固香港作為國際航運中心，提出新嘅政策同埋措施。主席本人僅此陳辭，支持二零一九年貨運貨櫃安全條例修誒修訂條例草案。

225
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,280
集裝箱安全公約。

226
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,820
先至能夠去誒跟翻呢個公約。

227
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:15,910
如果認為有關嘅貨櫃未能符合呢個條例咧，

228
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:09,170
而二咧就係一個統一貨櫃牌照上嘅計量用詞嘅單位。

229
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:28,530
而我哋到咗今天，誒七年甚至十年後咧。

230
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:15,490
而第三樣就係有關修訂貨櫃結構安全測試嘅程序。

231
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:22,940
呢兩項嘅決議咧，其實喺二零一零同埋二零一三年係已經通過。

232
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:47,830
呢個國際海事組織咧，就就住今次我哋有關嘅修訂咧，就係有呢個國際。

233
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:16,950
而呢個公約嘅規定咧，國際運輸嘅貨櫃上面咧，應該裝定有效嘅安全合格牌照。

234
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:42,760
呢個公約其實就係利便貨櫃咧喺國際間運輸，而國際海事組織咧就係透過呢個公約咧。

235
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:08,610
對於職安健，對於有關誒從事同貨櫃有關嘅工作嘅人咧，呢一個公約咧係非常之重要。

236
01:06:51,610 --> 01:07:03,590
裏邊嘅兩項嘅決議，包括咗三個嘅措施。一就係有關貨櫃嘅牌照上所需標記嘅資料提出新嘅規定。

237
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:51,430
公約其實喺九七誒對唔住七七年嘅時候已經生效，而我哋咧就籍住運貨貨櫃安全條例第五零六章，其中四條附屬法例就喺香港實施。

238
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:56,950
去就住測試同檢查貨櫃要求制定嘅劃一標準，同埋定明貨櫃嘅保養、檢驗、管制程序，以保障運輸嘅安全啦。呢呢點係好重要。

239
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:37,240
而呢啲牌照咧，係要由公約替約方嘅認可機構發出，而呢啲牌照亦都需要載有關於屬於呢個貨櫃指定嘅資料，而當中咧當然係包括咗批准嘅國家貨櫃嘅製造日期，同埋佢嘅最大載重量。

240
01:08:51,710 --> 01:09:11,720
而香港海事處咧嘅處長就獲賦權委任一啲認可機構去檢驗啦、測試同埋批准貨櫃。而海事處亦都透過包括咗檢查船上嘅貨櫃，負責監督整體嘅合規情況。海事事處長。

241
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,270
咁誒？

242
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,650
咁而呢一種嘅做法咧？

243
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,170
今次呢一個立法建議咧。

244
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:20,650
其實可以書面宣佈有關批准作廢。

245
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,160
佢基本上就可以話，即係將公約嘅一啲嘅。

246
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,800
其中就係一避免咗貨櫃喺運輸途中倒塌或者破損咧。

247
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:11,800
今次咧就會直接用提述嘅方式，將公約咧係納入呢條法例。

248
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:53,290
所以呢個改動咧，就係亦都包括咗質量嚟到代替重量呢啲詞匯。

249
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:34,140
條例草案係定明呢啲貨櫃嘅新測試程序，同埋牌照上面嘅標記規定。

250
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:06,440
第二樣咧就係喺某啲特別嘅情況底下，貨櫃喺裝載、堆碼同埋運輸過程咧。

251
01:10:55,590 --> 01:11:04,800
第四點咧，就頭先阿尹兆堅議員都提到，就係國際海事組織咧不時更新呢啲公約技術啦，咁條例草案就。

252
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:45,820
而為咗便利國際運輸貨櫃條例草案規定貨櫃嘅牌照上面嘅標記嘅尺寸同埋單位咧，應該同國際單位係一致。

253
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:43,660
草案就規定咗堆碼或者拉堆誒，對唔住，堆碼或者係推拉能力有限嘅貨櫃咧，喺牌照上要具有劃一嘅顯眼標記。

254
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:57,750
令到人易容易識別，咁有關嘅工作人員咧，亦都可以知道佢嘅擺放位置。譬如佢係有限嘅能力嘅話咧，應該係擺放喺貨櫃嘅頂層。

255
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:26,730
有啲所謂單門操作，就係佢會用一個門咧係打開或者係卸下，令到貨櫃裏邊嘅通風同埋空氣流動咧係保持良好或者係改善，而確為咗確保呢一種嘅改裝嘅貨櫃嘅運作同埋結構安全咧。

256
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:40,450
誒負責就可以取代我哋而家法例或者條例裏邊嘅一啲嘅附表。咁尹兆堅議員就住呢一點咧，佢提出擔心。誒，我亦都有同感嘅，即係噉樣嘅做法咧，係有機會令到立法。

257
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,320
經過修訂嘅規定。

258
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,550
例如政府咧，啱啱今年。

259
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:55,790
第一，我哋係大落後。

260
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:44,360
立法會咧係失去咗有關修訂嘅機會。

261
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:54,060
而其實政府同運防局係好清楚呢個情況。

262
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:24,430
已經做過嘅嘢，但係呢個唔係單獨嘅例子。

263
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:19,530
呢個就係要追翻公約好多年以前。

264
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:35,030
海上運輸旅客及行李責任限制條例草案。

265
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:19,670
海事法例嘅積壓問題咧，仍然未能夠解決。

266
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:30,750
其實近年嚟咧，政府係做過好多類似嘅雙船嘅規定。

267
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:51,550
就住今次呢一個條例草案嘅二讀咧，我主要有三點。

268
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:29,570
公佈咗新一年度嘅立法程序，立法會咧仍然要處理呢個雙船。

269
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:43,430
而呢條草案咧，更加係海事組織呢個國際海事組織喺二零零二年已經。

270
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:14,120
我哋落後嘅情況咧，就係正如我頭先講啦，呢兩個嘅決議咧喺個公約裏邊咧，其實已經係喺七年同埋十年之前已經通過，但係我哋而家先至作出相關嘅修例工作。

271
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:49,190
譬如話要追翻公約早幾年前嘅一啲嘅防止污誒油污固體散貨，以致到海員工作條件等呢啲嘅附屬法例咧，都係遲咗好幾年先至提交上立法會。

272
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:14,410
律政司喺二零一四年咧就成立咗一個專責小組，係處理海事法例，並且咧喺二零一四至零一九年咧開設咗一個副首席政府律師編外職位，去領導相關嘅工作。不過，

273
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,560
好。

274
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,830
當我哋嘅工作環境，

275
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:40,800
我哋亦都知道呢啲碼頭工人咧，佢哋嘅工時非常之長。

276
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:46,180
誒張超雄議員，我最後一次提醒你，你離題啦！請你翻返嚟呢個辯論通話。

277
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:52,180
而家我哋嘅係預算，明年先至處理。

278
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:35,080
咁當時係有一個張超雄議員，請你翻翻嚟，而家有變啦，同埋好，主席。

279
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:41,660
一啲都可以。張志紅議員，請你翻返呢個辯論，我唔好講我哋嘅航運業，好嗎？好嘅，主席。

280
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:51,090
嗱，今次嘅修訂係誒，正如我哋嘅條例裏邊都講，係有關運貨貨櫃嘅安全。

281
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:35,360
呢個就正正顯示咧，其實呢一個工作安全係咪純粹能夠通過呢個貨櫃安全修訂嘅條例草案而達到咧？

282
01:15:51,650 --> 01:16:03,450
呢個安全係咪可以經今次嘅修訂，就能夠將我哋喺同貨櫃有關嘅工作嘅安全程度增加咧？

283
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:28,750
呢個落後咧，我唔知道係咪同我哋個架構有關。譬如喺回歸初期嘅時候咧，其實航運政策咧係由經濟發展及勞工局負責嘅。

284
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:24,060
同埋我哋嘅工作嘅時間，正如過去我哋都有留意到，即係就算喺疫情底下，今次嘅其中一個爆發點咧，正正就係碼頭工人嘅一個休息嘅地方。

285
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:12,890
所以政府就話：我哋好多嘢咧，就誒咩做龍頭，做呢個國際即係誒航運嘅一個中心，或者至少係亞洲嘅航運中心。但係其實我哋啲法例咧係非常之落。

286
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:55,400
誒，我都係講緊，即係今次呢個修訂嘅大落後咧，可能同我哋嘅決策或者政策嘅架構係有關。咁而呢一個噉樣到今日，我哋房運房局係以一個好似交通政策，即係話。

287
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:15,410
就跟翻啲國際嘅公約，就總之咧，我哋係不斷去追落後，追翻呢啲公約嘅規定，循規蹈矩，交通安全嘅政策噉樣去處理我哋嘅航運政策咧，而唔係以經濟發展噉樣嘅嘅角度去睇咧，我係擔心咧，其實。

288
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:35,420
我哋繼續噉樣做呢啲嘅誒有關相關嘅修訂咧，我哋永遠都係喺度追落後，亦都冇辦法咧令到我哋嘅航運業咧能夠發展。你睇我哋過去十幾年咧，香港港口嘅吞吐量咧係不斷下跌嘅。喺二千年初，我哋係全球第

289
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,770
好嘅。

290
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,140
但係咧。

291
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:08,460
測試同埋批准呢啲貨櫃。

292
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,280
咁呢個安全嘅目的咧，就冇辦法達到啦。

293
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:49,800
就規定啲堆碼或者係推拉力有限嘅貨櫃要標籤好啊，容易識別啊等等，但係。

294
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:31,080
噉我哋就誒繼續就住呢個條例草案嗰度，我哋會誒繼續誒講翻。

295
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:41,810
一個相對技術性嘅問題啦。今次呢個條例草案咧，佢當然係針對貨櫃安全嘅問題，亦都係應國際組織嘅決議要求。

296
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:54,650
貨櫃碼頭或者係嗰啲貨櫃嘅堆場咧，或者新界裏邊好多嘅中地，其實都係擺住擺滿住呢啲貨櫃。咁究竟係咪由海事處去執法咧？

297
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:40,980
但係喺貨櫃碼頭或者鄰近嘅堆場嘅貨櫃咧，究竟點樣擺放，又係咪海事處嘅工作咧？呢條條例經過今次修正之後，其實

298
01:17:47,940 --> 01:18:02,420
出我對於有關貨櫃工作嘅安全嘅一啲意見，噉我希望你咧都容許我咧，即係就住呢方面咧有所誒表達，而呢一個即係。

299
01:18:50,280 --> 01:19:05,370
正如政府提交畀我哋嘅參考資料裏邊指出咧，呢一個海事處嘅處長係的確係獲賦權咧委任認可機構去檢驗。

300
01:16:47,460 --> 01:17:02,990
主席，我其實都係想講翻今次呢一個條例，佢話希望增加一啲運貨貨櫃嘅安全，但係當我哋好多其他嘅政策或者係實際環境係唔配合嘅話，

301
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:26,390
我哋因為冇成立嗰個法案委員會啦，我哋冇詳細討論，我哋冇傾清楚咧，佢嘅執行，我哋唔知道海事處咧係咪只會檢查船上嘅貨櫃。

302
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:21,010
貨櫃工作包括咗碼頭工作或者係誒張超雄議員，我真係最後提醒你，你可以喺個貨櫃安全講貨櫃碼頭嘅安全咧，你應該喺事務委員會去跟進。如果你繼續嚟睇咧，我唯有停止發言，請你翻返嚟呢個辯論同埋。

303
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:27,630
咁當然，你話純粹係講翻誒嗰個標記，誒或者係即係嗰個改動嘅一啲詞匯，誒就住個量度嘅單位，或者係即係一啲比較技術性嘅修訂嘅話咧，我哋喺呢個議會度咧。

304
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:47,940
我我就唔會用嗰啲時間啦。我哋去傾呢個問題，因為今次係收誒，我哋講緊係恢復二讀主席，所以我哋就藉就住呢一個法例嘅整體，佢係指向增加安全，而我係從呢個角度咧，希望提。

305
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,210
究竟？

306
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,950
誒，各位同事。

307
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,520
基本法嘅責任。

308
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,420
咁所以今次呢一個嘅規例。

309
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:47,610
到目前為止咧，今日嘅會議進行咗大概多過七小時。

310
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:23,940
海事處係咪又會巡查，同埋會書面宣佈呢啲唔合規格嘅貨櫃作廢咧？

311
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:06,990
依個令到會議係無法暢順進行，亦都無法畀到議員去履行佢嘅。

312
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:20,100
如果大家係繼續係噉樣咧，我就會運用我主持會議嘅權力咧，去限制。

313
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:08,380
同以上我提到嘅一啲規例有冇關係？可唔可以處理到中地作業入邊嘅貨櫃嘅安全問題？

314
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:57,870
但係咧，已經用咗大約三個小時，接近三個小時，點算法定人數？同埋一個多小時咧，係因為流會而損失。

315
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:39,350
上面而忽略咗喺貨櫃碼頭或者其他堆貨，或者係甚至中地上嘅堆貨嘅貨櫃有關咧？

316
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:52,030
貨物搬運同貨櫃處理作業規定都有規管咧，船澳啦貨櫃碼頭入邊嘅貨櫃擺放咧，係同其他同類嘅作業安排。

317
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:38,570
而其實咧，我哋有唔同嘅職安條例或者消防條例，都同呢一個貨櫃安全有關嘅。譬如話，香港法例第五十九K章《工廠及工業經營》。

318
01:19:55,050 --> 01:20:15,060
條例草案裏邊講到個實效就係海事處處長，如果認為有貨櫃未能夠符合條例裏裏邊任何嘅規定，係可以書面宣佈有關嘅批准作廢。咁如果呢啲喺中地上面嘅貨櫃係唔符合安全標準。

319
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:28,860
今次運房局提出呢個條例草案，要改善貨櫃擺放安全，要求堆碼同拉力較弱嘅貨櫃咧，係放喺貨櫃嘅頂層。但係其實呢一條貨櫃嘅適用範圍係咪淨係只在於佢哋喺輪船？

320
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:40,570
大家嘅發言，噉我希望咧，而家已經係六點半啦。大家今日區體同聆民都未必喺個議事廳，噉我就會宣佈休會。希望大家休息夠咧，明天係令到個會議暢順。一如上次會議咧，我會根據議事規則第十。

321
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:48,220
四括號五條咧，係喺一點至兩點鐘咧，係暫停會議。會議暫停，明天九時續會。
