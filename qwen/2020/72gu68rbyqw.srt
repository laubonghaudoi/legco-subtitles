1
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,490
好，揾下馬馬信康機長。

2
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,680
Good afternoon, Chairman, Members.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,030
個會議啦，我哋而家跟住咧就F.C.R.二零一九二零廿一號文件。

4
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,070
因為咧，佢就係呢一個訓練中心嘅設計，誒負責設計。

5
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,640
In emergency manoeuvres in the in the simulator, that we can't carry out in the in the actual aircraft.

6
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:40,460
到誒衡量嘅，而係即係佢哋喺香港嘅話，有突發事件嘅時候，係可以誒出動更加多嘅人出去。

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,510
係將關乎政府飛行服務隊模擬飛行訓練中心嘅一九零之K號工程計劃咧提升為甲級。

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:30,800
估計所需費用係一億一千二百十萬，用以咧興建政府飛行服務隊模擬飛行誒訓練中心。

9
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:14,610
呢個項目係請本委員會咧通過公務小組委員會咧喺二零一九年四月廿六日會議上就PWC二零一八一九四十四號文件所提出嘅建議。

10
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:16,740
In terms of the usage of the simulator, we're expecting by 2021 that we'll have 62 helicopter pilots, and at the moment, those helicopter pilots have to go overseas for their simulator training.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:12,620
係阿譚文豪議員先五分鐘。誒誒，唔該主席嗱，我個其實即係之前我都表達過啦，其實都應該要做嘅呢件事，因為始終誒有佢唔同嘅好處啦，包括啲機師唔需要係去外國度誒進行訓練啊，或者係誒考翻牌啦。

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:51,220
公務小組委員會咧，係審議上就建議時間係五廿分鐘，亦都提交咗政府都提交咗份文件啦。我係申報，我係立業保險集團控股有限公司嘅董事同埋行政總裁。解答大家問題咧，我哋有保安局嘅副局長歐志光先生啦，同埋其他嘅政府嘅人員嘅。噉啊，邊位想提問？請撳掣。

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:32,910
咁變咗，佢係喺香港嘅時候咧，有啲咩事、突發事件咧，佢哋都可以誒，即係就算佢放假，可能隨時任命嘅時候啊，即刻叫佢去誒做做嘢啊，同埋誒就變咗唔使即係一頭一尾飛去外國，又飛翻翻嚟。咁中間慳咗嗰啲時間咧，其實唔係用錢嚟到。

14
00:01:40,740 --> 00:02:00,750
咁所以即係其實成個項目咧，就即係已經係誒撇除咗。頭先所講即係咪純粹係睇錢咁簡單㗎啦？咁但係我上次咧，我我印象中喺嗰個問過咧，就係誒預計咧，即係呢一個模擬駕駛器啦。咁當然頭先所講咧，佢會做一啲嘅訓練啦，同埋考牌嚟到嚟到誒。

15
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:20,760
誒原因即係嚟到使用啦。咁誒有冇計過一個月佢誒或者係平均每一日佢會用幾多個鐘啊？即係用你哋嗰個嘅誒計算嚇。唔該，主席。好，邊位答啊？係誒，主席多謝曬誒，或者我請誒飛行服務隊嘅阿馬機長。

16
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:54,300
Thank you, Mr. Tam, for the question. As you quite rightly said, the the simulator will be an excellent training tool for the GFS and will certainly enhance the safety of the of the operations. But by enabling us to carry out a wide range of normal

17
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,860
好。

18
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,990
Is there any plan to expand expand your fleets? Thank you.馬信康機長。

19
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,900
And obviously, we'll continue to review that situation as we go forwards in the next few years.

20
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:46,090
have a major benefit in terms of the travelling time and the time that they're away from GFS, and by

21
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:37,950
Thank you, Mr. Tam. You're quite right. Next next year, we hope that the forward base at Kai Tak will come into operation. We've

22
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,420
You know, most of the time we'll be using the device nearly every day, and for 80% of the total time in the year.

23
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:15,660
In the simulator will be used by GFS pilots and also other staff for for training, so.

24
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:38,330
By having the simulator on site at GFS, obviously it means that the pilots don't have to go overseas. So obviously we will.

25
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:26,100
特別是，我們會有會有個 simulator in in the future。 It means that some of the training that's currently carried out on the helicopter can actually be carried out in the simulator.

26
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:28,400
The only simulator for the type of helicopter that we have, the H175, is in France. So they go there twice a year, every six months, to renew their licences.

27
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:15,330
and the retaining two of the155s at the moment we don't have any plans to further extend the fleet of the H175 we think it should be sufficient to cope with all of our operational and training commitments.

28
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:23,580
such expansion. So my question is, do you have you know any plans for extending the fleet? Particularly when you now have the Kai Tak satellite base, will be in will be using it in few years time.

29
00:03:46,370 --> 00:04:06,380
using those simulator hours in our own simulator, we can also add on top of that a certain proportion of the helicopter training hours which we carry out every year. And those two things added together, we expect that around eighty percent, so eight zero percent of the time.

30
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:46,580
Okay, thank you, Captain Marshall. So basically, you talk about eighty percent of the time will be used for training or for the type rating license and whatsoever. So that would be the target. Would that be also including your plan you mentioned about two thousand and twenty one?

31
00:04:46,580 --> 00:05:06,590
The helicopters pilot, is there any any other plan for any extension for the H175 fleet? Because the reason I'm asking is, if that's a plan, you know, for the GFS to buy more helicopters, would that simulator still you know capable for facility?

32
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:58,240
just in the last two or three months, achieved full operational capability on the H one hundred and seventy five. So that means that all seven of the helicopters are now in operation. So the the old fleet, the Super Puma L two, is now being retired and will be disposed of in due.

33
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,750
多謝。

34
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,330
好啊，馬記者。

35
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:55,100
我我 just wanted to clarify that the 80% figure I mentioned was the actual usage in the flight simulator. So, of the available hours in the flight simulator, we expect to use about 80% of the the time available.

36
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:14,360
regarding the usage of the car parks, the car parks, the existing car parks, is it possible for the government to to ensure or get you know any better place or it's the best place that you can think about?

37
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:39,280
There will be no need to expand the fleet of H175 helicopters beyond the current seven. Even with the the operation, the coming into operation of the forward base, we think that seven helicopters will be sufficient. Particularly as we will have the simulator.

38
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:53,900
啊！陳石莊元五分鐘啊，主席，我就門外看啦，唔敢唔敢班門弄斧，我就想問一問，因為見到咧就誒有部分舊嘅機就退役咗啦，亦都頭先有講到新買咗嘅咧，就係呢一個誒H一七五型嘅，噉就七部已經喺舊年咧就全面。

39
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:13,910
投入服務啦，咁亦都見到咧飛行服務隊嘅直升機機師嘅人數咧，亦都增加到去而家六十二人。咁誒，我就想了解一下咧，其實即係而家噉樣嘅誒安排，嗰個即係係咪唔需要真係加大嗰個？

40
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:33,920
誒嗰個機組咧，咁因為頭先啊，頭先我聽到佢話唔會加大咧，但係譚文浩議員嘅時候，咁誒，我就想了解下係啦，會唔會加大咧？因為誒，如果佔用咗八十個百分之八十嘅時候，如果真係加大嘅話，誒係咪能夠應付咧？第二咧，我就見到咧，佢係用一個停

41
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:53,930
車場位嗰度起係咪好似好好陰公啊？即係主席，即係本來係一個有應用緊嘅地方、有用途嘅地方，噉佢就要喺個停車場嗰度起一個誒誒，畀佢哋練習嘅地方，咁跟住又要再起一個臨時嘅停車場。我想問下，其實我當然明白佢嗰個處於嗰個。

42
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:13,940
位置係希望就翻，亦都係方便。咁但係，我想問下係咪即係有機場島又剩有咁多地方，係咪又起咗商場嘅時候，點解即係政府部門一個真係服務市民嘅隊伍點點解會誒即係要好似要攞緊一啲本來用得好好哋嘅地方去起一個？

43
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:33,950
誒咁值得誒做嘅嘅工程咧。咁另外第三咧就可能未必係好直接嘅，但係就因為趁阿副局長喺度，因為咧其實近年咧呢個飛行服務隊要出動嘅時候咧，其實多咗，可能有好多咧都係關行山事。我本身都係一個山友，咁但係確係可能係咪？

44
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:53,960
真係出動多咗，而好多時候咧，亦都會有誒隨行嘅醫生同埋護士，佢哋本身都係義務性質，可能即係一啲比較微薄嘅居馬費。我就想問下，即係唔好意思啊，雖然係有啲搭單，但係我想問下有冇機會？即係當然，我覺得啲護士同埋醫生唔係真係志在你嗰啲錢，咁但係會唔會考？

45
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:13,970
內可以誒會好少少，亦都誒即係又冇誒配合話可以教育下啲誒朋友去行山嘅一啲基本知識咧。唔該，主席。哦，報章，誒都係主席，主席或者我答咗啊陳議員第三個問題先啦，然後第一同埋第二個問題咧，我交畀啊誒啊馬機長咧，誒。

46
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,900
Seriously, bear in mind. Thank you.

47
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,620
但係， it's it's certainly something that we will.

48
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,420
服務隊亦都引進一啲新型號嘅直升機嘅話。

49
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,880
And once the simulator is completed, then we can move back into the car park.

50
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:51,320
咁呢個訓練中心咧，應該有一個能力咧，係去即係誒。

51
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:25,100
We did a careful analysis of the various places that we could put the simulator. We even looked at actually placing it inside the the hangar.

52
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:26,470
好，阿張子榮議員係五分鐘。好，唔該主席。誒，呢個我當然都係門外漢啦。咁誒，我哋誒，當然會支持。

53
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:18,550
模擬飛行嘅中心咧，全世界淨係得法國有嘅啫噉，咁所以即係如果要訓練呢啲誒飛機師咧，就誒變咗可能就一定要去法國進行訓練。

54
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:44,420
其實即係過去飛行服務隊對香港市民提供嘅服務咧，都係誒獲得唔少嘅稱譽嘅。咁誒，今次呢個即係模擬嘅飛行訓練中心咧，誒根據文件講，當然係一個必要啦。

55
00:13:44,740 --> 00:14:02,720
亦都係因應住你哋誒更換咗現役嘅一啲直升機，就變成新嗰種H一七五型嘅直升機咧。其實出價應該都已經喺舊年全面投入服務。咁而根據文件講咧，你話呢一種嘅飛機嘅。

56
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:15,140
就因為呢個係一個緊急嘅服務，同埋誒，亦都係即係可能好多時候仲要拯救市民。咁嗰個希望你可以盡量協助佢哋嗰個停車位嗰度誒，盡量協助。因為我機管局而家又係一百percent own by政府㗎啦，而家即係我我係希望你可以協助到佢哋揾到一個適合嘅地點。唔該曬。

57
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:33,980
關於咧係一啲誒我哋誒業務嘅醫生啊同埋護士咧，佢嗰時咧係星期六啊星期日，我諗陳議員想即係講就係係跟埋我哋直升機係去到現場係即時可以投到幫助，咁呢啲係誒好好嘅一啲嘅誒業務工作啦。噉我亦都係誒知道咧佢哋係做咗好多呢。

58
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:53,990
啲噉嘅情況嘅，所以我哋都希望咧係可以畀到一啲嘅誒誒認同佢哋咧。我哋諗緊係究竟係喺邊個方面嘅認同，譬如一啲係誒獎狀啊，或者獎章啊。我哋諗緊呢方面嘅工作咁誒，希望阿陳議員都可以誒瞭解嘅情況。我喺第一、第二個問題，我交畀阿馬記者。

59
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:21,040
To recap on my answer to Mr. Tam about expanding the fleet, we've done a careful analysis of all of the flying commitments that we have. We've carried out over the last five years, and we are fairly confident that in the forthcoming few years.

60
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:45,550
The building that we use for putting the helicopters in, but unfortunately, the height of the building for the simulator is too tall to fit inside the hangar. So in the end, the only piece of space that we have is is a corner of the car park. Now, the the most difficult period for us will be during the construction of the simulator.

61
00:11:45,550 --> 00:12:05,560
Building, because obviously that will take up most of the car park, and we've been fairly fortunate to to to have an arrangement with the airport authority to have a temporary car park outside of the GFS, with appropriate security facilities, of course, and we can actually use that for the two year construction period.

62
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:31,170
There will be obviously a loss of car parking spaces. So this is something that we're going to have to continually review over the next two to three years to make sure that all of our colleagues and particularly those who work on shifts and live a long way from GFS have somewhere to park their car in the future.

63
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,970
郭家麒議員五分鐘。

64
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,720
同埋，我亦都睇到文典，你哋話。

65
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,080
我OK，唔該，唔該住。

66
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,890
如果有咗呢個模擬訓練中心之後，

67
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,440
咁呢個都係幾用時間同埋金錢啦，噉我都想問。

68
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,720
其實部門係需要安排每一位直升機師咧，係每十二至十八個月咧去海外進行模擬器嘅訓練同考核嘅。

69
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:54,990
噉我覺得即係你都當然，我會預計應該個需要係減低啦，大大減低啦。噉你可唔可以肯定一下？誒，即係呢兩樣嘅問題。

70
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:03,980
更新佢哋嘅訓練模式或者個飛行儀器咧，應該都可以配合得到。如果唔係，即係嗰筆錢就好似好好嘥咁啦。如果純粹係為呢一種型號嘅飛機。

71
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:42,930
呢一個噉樣嘅要求係咪基本上已經可以誒取消，即係免去咗咧？因為我唔係好肯定啊，即係睇你文件就冇講得好清楚，呢樣嘢一定會可以誒慳翻。

72
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:54,700
時候咧，第一我哋唔使飛到去喺法國里昂嗰度啦，因為有旅程啊，又有可能有啲要休息啊噉樣。咁可以香港，咁亦都咧可以香港嘅時候咧，有啲咩需要去奉奉召誒出動嘅時候咧，可以個彈性大好多。咁誒，大概係噉樣，主席。

73
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:57,010
O.K.張超紅議員，係係點啊？陳淑莊議員係。我我希望誒政府都知道，即係可能始終搬咗嗰個地方咧。頭先講嗰個臨時嘅停車場，似乎都好似有段距離。噉我希望可以跟進翻，因為誒可能消防服務隊頭先都有講，由我義工啊嗰啲噉樣，我諗即係盡量可以協助到。

74
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:38,840
噉我就主要想問咧，其實誒呢個模擬飛行中心咧，一個訓練中心咧，我相信就應該唔係淨係侷限喺某一種型號嘅直升機啊，即係如果將來有一啲誒新嘅型號、新嘅發展，而我哋飛行

75
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:15,930
係，阿副局長。誒誒，都係主席。誒誒，關於換呢個誒模擬器咧，誒，因為我哋依家個個直升機嘅機隊，啱啱嗰七隻嘅直升機咧，都係全個機隊都係呢個H一七五啦。咁所以我哋用呢個模擬器咧，都係呢個H一七五咧就可以符合曬成個機隊嘅用法。咁呢一個嘅。

76
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:35,940
一七五咧，我哋預計咧係誒嗰個誒，根據我哋上一個機隊咧，呢一個嘅機隊咧，起碼可以用到十五年嘅，或者係更長嘅時間。而呢個模擬器咧，我哋個估計咧都係二十年至二十五年嘅。咁所以咧，兩者咧配合咧就係有一個比較好嘅時間，比較穩定。咁未。

77
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,790
嗯。

78
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,670
第二個就誒。

79
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,560
如果佢係一個，

80
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,110
誒時數係幾多？

81
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,140
因為如果佢個時數係，可能佢用係佢個。

82
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,990
我唔知而家個模擬器個使用嗰個情況。舉個例，我意思即係話喺一年到晚咧，佢個使用嗰個誒。

83
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:18,590
即係我我意思即係嗰嚿嘢都用咗咁多錢，但係佢可能用好短嘅時間。咁如果我哋有一條渠有一個渠道。

84
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:11,110
有六十二個機長嘅，而按我哋而家係派去外國嗰個訓練咧，佢哋去到外國訓練咧，大概係五日，即係去到法國嘅時候咧，有五日。

85
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:48,760
模擬飛行器嘅時候咧，就唔使又到時又要再起啦，又要再等啦，或者要再用誒好多個錢去做一個即係建築物。呢個第一個。

86
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:09,350
即係某啲情況下，佢可以去用，或者其他有啲人係誒會用，或者一啲政府飛行服務隊以外嘅人，如果佢係有呢個需要，佢可以申請去用。咁變咗就。

87
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:21,430
總量嘅可能係一成或者兩成，舉個例，咁其實佢仲有好多空間嘅，咁個空間咧就有冇諗過點樣去善用？舉個例，為一啲其他嘅地區誒嘅。

88
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:56,500
去申請去用呢一啲嘅誒飛行器啦，咁當然佢一定要受一啲守則啦，即係佢唔唔會係一個普通人啦，即係可能好似我前邊嗰位譚文豪議員噉，佢係一個即係即係識得去飛噉樣，噉佢可以去。

89
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:36,730
然後需要多過超過一個模擬器咧，咁點解我咁問咧？如果係嘅話，會唔會喺而家興建嗰個即係規劃入邊咧，就預留多啲嘅空間，令到將來如果有多過需要有需要多過一個？

90
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:40,100
嘅一啲嘅飛行員去提供呢個服務，或者賣出嚟啊，或者係即係點都好啦。咁用呢個第一啦，第二就係喺民用嘅民間，譬如有一啲飛行嘅愛好者，佢可唔可以由嗯？

91
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:55,950
來咧，我哋會睇係即係嗰個發展噉樣。咁當然咧，模擬器如果係當第二日誒嗰個機隊係換咗另外一種嘅飛機咧，咁個模擬器咧可以係轉佢另外一種嘅模擬器。咁有部分嘅替換咧機隊啦，部分嘅一啲嘢咧可以留翻低嘅。當然個外殼，我哋嘅建

92
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:15,960
建築可以留低啦，入邊有啲咩留低又要視乎將來我哋係用邊個嘅機種。咁誒，張議員第二個問題咧就係話誒嗰個訓練嗰度咧誒用舊嗰個機隊咧，我哋冇錯係十二月十二個至十二個月至十八個月咧，就要派人去海外去訓練。但係因為我哋轉咗呢個新。

93
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:35,970
嘅機隊咧，民航處嘅要求咧係我哋要每六個月咧就要派個機師就要做呢一個模擬器嘅訓練嘅，就唔係淨係飛兩者都要做，又要飛啦，又要模擬器訓練。如果模擬器訓練唔夠咧，就要飛就要飛多啲，所以咧直升機要飛飛多咗噉樣。咁因為我哋有個模擬器喺香港嘅。

94
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:20,580
唔該，我我第一我就支持呢個嗯飛行訓練中心。就但係我就想問一樣嘢，就係譬如而家就我睇到個文件咧，係佢一個建築物一個模擬器噉樣咯。將來會唔會有個機會？譬如當個服務又擴展啊，機隊又一路誒擴展嘅時？

95
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,530
needs in the future.

96
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,630
係馬局長。

97
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,090
嘅相關收費。

98
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,690
咁資料顯示咧。

99
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,420
咁當時局方咧就話係唔知道。

100
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,000
舊年五月廿二號咧，局方其實就回咗信。

101
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,360
相關嘅誒資料同埋是否有相關嘅限制咧？主席。

102
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:19,590
交流啊，參觀啊，呢個我諗阿馬機長佢哋可能都都會同意到呢一方面，或者誒問題，我交畀阿馬機長去回答啊。我阿馬信康機長。

103
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:08,870
部長，誒主席啊，誒我哋未有誒更新資料，我呢個係我哋即係知道個資料就係誒依家即係德州嗰度嘅嗰個無兒瞓中心咧，就仲未有任何資料或者麥基將有冇補充啊？

104
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:50,150
德州相關嘅模擬訓練中心嘅收費同埋對非本土機師使用嘅限制等等，想了解一下到今時今日啦，誒局方有冇更更新嘅資料？是否知悉德州嗰邊？

105
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:22,170
楊嶽橋議員五分鐘。誒，唔該主席，舊年呢個項目咧喺公務小組嘅時候，當時譚文豪議員咧就問過當局是否知悉美國德州開嘅模擬飛行訓練中心。

106
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:40,880
佢嚟，佢一個冇任何商業利益嘅噉，咪收佢成本啦。咁如果佢一個商業利益有關嘅噉，可能我哋你可以考慮收佢一啲費用去支持翻嗰個營運啦。咁呢啲得唔得咧？嚇兩個問題係啊，郭生主席誒，多謝曬誒兩個問題咧。我答第二個問題啊。

107
00:20:40,880 --> 00:21:00,890
第一個問題咧，關於係嗰個誒模擬器嘅設計係咪係擺多一個模擬器落去咧？咁嗰度我交畀阿馬機長，因為咧馬機長係負責設計同埋將來咧佢做負責訓練嘅。噉係關於係模擬器嘅使用咧，我哋都有計算過咧。誒，大概咧依家我哋會誒喺出年咧，我哋會係去到。

108
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:31,400
咁誒當然係包埋一啲嘅誒飛機嘅嗰啲航程啊，咁但係咧佢訓練咧係五日。咁如果我哋簡單去計一計咧，如果六十二個機長咧誒佢哋係訓練係五日嘅咧，大概就已經係三百日㗎啦。噉我哋每六個月就要每個機長咧要係去考一次試。噉就如果咁加埋落去咧，就可能係。

109
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:51,410
已經係超過咗，即係依家我哋嗰個模擬器嗰個可以畀其他人用嗰個能量。咁當然呢度我哋可以有啲誒誒，可以再誒優化咗嗰個嘅誒效能嘅。咁誒頭先阿馬機長都有講過咧，將來係個模擬器做咗嘅時候咧，嗰個使用率咧係去到八成嘅。咁另外有兩成。

110
00:21:51,410 --> 00:22:11,420
啦，就係做啲維修啊，或者檢查噉，所以咧，我哋誒估計咧就係誒個使用量咧已經係去到差唔多我哋即係需要個使用量嘅。咁當然，如果仲有一啲係一啲外國嘅一啲相同嘅，譬如係係同飛行服務有關係嘅，同拯救有關係嘅外國嘅政府，如果嚟到香港，想大家加。

111
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:43,440
Thank you, Dr. Kwok. Regarding the construction of the building, at the moment the the site is is going to be almost full with the construction of our flight simulator training centre, which will accommodate just one simulator. In fact, looking to the future, if we do need

112
00:22:43,440 --> 00:23:03,450
To expand the fleet of helicopters, it's expected that we would buy more helicopters of the same type rather than branch out and buy a different helicopter type. So we can foresee that having one flight simulator training centre and one full flight simulator that will be quite sufficient for.

113
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,920
係啊，馬機長係。

114
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,890
That that that should be no problem.

115
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,860
胡長，係多謝主席，或者我交畀阿馬機長咧。

116
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:24,270
政府、本港政府人員之外，會畀其他人士都會愛嚟使用嘅咧，主席。

117
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:49,130
rate in America will be much different from the rate that's being charged in Europe at the at the moment.

118
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:58,600
明白，主席。另外咧，就係想問翻，今次新買入呢七架係Airbus一H一七五啦。

119
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:12,290
誒，主席恕我愚昧，現時咧，飛行服務隊有冇同樣嘅安排？就係喺政府嘅內部訓練之餘。

120
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:22,310
係會開放畀其他，例如剛才機長所講嘅本地學校或者團體，係咪有同樣嘅安排？如果係，其實個標準係點樣嘅，主席？

121
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:22,380
No, as far as I know, Mr. Young, the the building the construction of the simulator centre in Texas is still ongoing. It's at a very early stage.

122
00:25:52,010 --> 00:26:02,840
The training centre for visits, particularly from local institutions or universities, for technical observations and things things of that nature.

123
00:26:50,510 --> 00:27:07,790
誒，主席，我有個跟隨嘅問題咧，就係剛才機長講話，即係大部分嘅時間都係留翻畀政府自己使用啦。但係文件其實亦都同樣顯示相關係講緊日間嘅啫。咁有冇打算其實夜間嘅時間係會有其他考慮嘅用途嘅？

124
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:42,670
Helicopter simulators in the world of this type for this size of helicopter, the market price we we know we know is the one that we quoted in the follow-up to the PWSC meeting. So, around 2,000 euros an hour is probably the the market rate, and I I don't think that the

125
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:18,890
將來咧，誒訓練中心咧係咪只係會畀翻政府內部嘅人員使用，定係會唔會有機會咧？因為相關嘅機種咧，例如直十五、中國製，其實都係一個好類近嘅一個機種嚟嘅，會唔會有機會？除咗政

126
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,050
Well, I.

127
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
啊，掹嘅啫。

128
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,550
馬機長。

129
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,360
馬記者。

130
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,910
who who are the

131
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,710
好，唔該，主席。好，戴民浩議員係四分鐘。

132
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:41,500
the maintenance and the software upgrades and so on, so so that would cover up certainly all of the daytime and some of the night time.

133
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:40,170
The Hong Kong CED, so it will be primarily for the issue and the renewal of Hong Kong CED-related pilot licences.

134
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:53,200
The Hong Kong CAD certification, are you going to get any other countries or or mainland Chinese authorities certification on this simulator?

135
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:13,810
Instructors and examiner currently that you're using. So is it? What my question is: Are you having in-house from you know GFS? You're doing all the examinations already.

136
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:10,070
the，thank you，Mr. Tom，the，the，certification or the qualification process for the simulator will be quite complicated，and obviously this is the first time that anybody in Hong Kong has bought a helicopter simulator。

137
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:56,170
Okay, so that will be only for Hong Kong City. Now my other question is: currently, are you doing the the training over in France? And obviously, that will be including the aircraft rating, instrument rating, and the residency training and all that.

138
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:22,910
When this simulator, I'm sure will be certified by CAD for the aircraft rating and instrument rating for for that. Would you also get the CAAC or any other foreign?

139
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:52,010
At the moment, because the usage rate will be very high of the flight simulator training centre, we expect that most of the time it or all of the time it will be taken up by GFS training for GFS staff. There may be some scope for opening up on a non-commercial basis, opening up.

140
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:48,160
At the moment, we we do host on a regular basis visits from schools and other organisations in Hong Kong. So I'm I'm sure that in the future we'll be able to accommodate visits to the flight simulator training centre on a carefully managed basis, of course, but.

141
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:33,340
When we say during the daytime, if if I were to tell you the times, it's starting at from six o'clock in the morning normally through to about ten o'clock at night. So normally it would be used for about sixteen hours a day, unless there's a particularly high usage requirement. Outside of those times, we'd be able to carry out the.

142
00:27:47,200 --> 00:28:07,210
Thank you, thank you, Chairman. That actually clears some of my question because I just look at the the paper. It actually mentioned eighty percent is the daily time, but you already answered that. That actually talk about sixteen hours, you know, per day, which is eighty percent, which I'm quite happy with. My question comes to

143
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:43,200
authorisation to certify this simulator as well, so that you know, for example, you know for CAC, obviously you know, for any Chinese pilot holder, they can also using this sim, you know, for their rating or examinations. So my question is, besides

144
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,730
所以那會係dry training。

145
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,920
more experienced pilots using our own instructors.

146
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,270
using our own approved instructors and examiners.

147
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:04,120
those pilots with those qualification should get extra allowance if that's not in the plan. Thank you.

148
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:21,290
或你實際上用的設施，你知喺法國，我講緊係講緊

149
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:36,550
Move into the simulator. I expect that we'll probably have slightly more approved simulator examiners because.

150
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:05,010
試驗呢？ at the moment for the H175， but what you're saying is you're going to turn them up and doing it in-house， because that make perfect sense because the the simulator will be in Hong Kong。

151
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:37,840
for the examiner, which is the one who actually sign your licence. So my question is, how many of those instructors and or the approved examiner that you require?

152
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:30,360
And it's it's planned that we're going to get it qualified up to level D, which is a globally recognised standard. It means at level D, it means that we can carry out licensing training and licensing tests under a regulatory authority. And at the moment, that regulatory authority is planned to be.

153
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:41,800
Thank you again, Mr. Tam. It's a good question. With with the old fleet, with the Super Puma and the EC One Hundred and Fifty Five, which were also French helicopters, and we had similar simulator training requirements. Once we became familiar with the helicopter, we were able to to deliver the training ourselves.

154
00:30:46,720 --> 00:31:06,730
And it's called wet or dry training. At the moment, we're doing wet training, so we're using instructors from the the simulator training facility in France. Once we become familiar with the simulator, with the helicopter and the simulator ourselves, we plan to run the training using our own instructors.

155
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:30,300
At the moment, we're in the process of formulating the type rating training course, which will be approved in our training manuals later on this year by the Hong Kong CED, and that will enable us to carry out the full type rating training for new pilots and also the renewals for

156
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:54,210
So, so, so, just to recap. At the moment, we're using the French instructors in France, but we've only had the helicopter for two years. Thank you, thank you, Catherine Marshall. So, my following question is: So, therefore, you don't have啊？請繼續啊，因為而家得翻你一個喺度。Okay, you you don't have the in-house instructors and

157
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,670
冇人翻嚟。

158
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,140
馬記者。

159
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,010
應該人喺度嘅，冇你一個都冇。

160
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,660
可能好多真係走咗，因為諗住冇咩。

161
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,840
好，可以冇其他問題咧。本人現在將。

162
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,200
啊啊！而家我哋打鐘先嚇。

163
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,020
有八個，我哋唔夠，一二三四五六七八。

164
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:38,510
本人現在將F.C.L.二零一九二零廿一號文件附紙表決，請贊成嘅舉手。

165
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:15,790
到12, role training captains， so that's 12 role training captains and maybe five or six approved examiners.

166
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:53,290
Ranked at senior pilot, so they actually get a little bit more remuneration than their normal operational colleagues at the moment. Thank you.

167
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:25,720
所以我還未Quite answer my last question. Do they receive any extra allowance? Sorry, that's probably above my pay grade, but.

168
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:47,120
and and less on on the helicopter. In terms of instructors, you're quite right again. We'll have more training captains qualified.

169
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:48,940
反對嘅請舉手。本人認為參與表嘅委員咧，多數贊成呢樣建呢樣建議獲得通過嘅。好，我哋跟住進入下一個項目嘅就係FCL二零一九二零四十個文件。

170
00:37:49,490 --> 00:38:04,980
呢個項目請本委員會批准咧，喺總目一八四轉撥國基金嘅款項，分目九九二給予創新及科技基金嘅款項，追加二十億撥款，以便開立承擔額。

171
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:20,940
設立資助計劃，資助生產商喺香港設立新嘅智能生產線，同埋咧喺總目一八四咧轉撥國基金嘅款項，分目九八七給予資本投資基金嘅款項下追加二十億撥款。

172
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:44,600
most of our examiners are qualified at least at the senior pilot level, so their remuneration is more than most of the operational colleagues. Pilot ones, the operational front line guys, and most of the, in fact all of the examiners.

173
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:25,300
my my question is how many examiner that you require, and is it also the examiner also will be doing the instructor job? Because like for example for the airline, they will have instructor role and some of the examiner role. So instructor is only doing the recurrent training, and or you know some of the the type training, but

174
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:58,130
for these operations. And my second question will be, for those who gain you know extra qualification within the GFS, are they going to get extra allowance? My opinion is they should because they're doing you know something extra, and you know extra qualification can sign the licence. So I believe you know I mean the bureau should consider.

175
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:28,280
Thank you again, Mr. Mr. Tam. At the moment, with the the interim solution, we're doing most of the training and testing on the actual helicopter. So we already have five approved examiners on the helicopter, and that's sufficient for for the number of pilots that we have. When we

176
00:33:47,400 --> 00:34:07,410
on the helicopter and in the simulator than examiners, because of the number of different roles that we carry out from from search and rescue to firefighting for night flying and so on, we need role training captains for each of these different roles. So we'll probably have with 62 pilots up.

177
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,540
投資者。

178
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,370
噉啊，最高咧就係一千五百萬，噉啊，誒低者為準。

179
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,140
投我哋嘅投入同佢哋嘅投入有啲相適應咯，唔該。啱，局長。

180
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,430
相間計劃嘅誒，其他嘅我請我秘書長阿阿蔡小姐可以講講嚇。

181
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,530
資，然後咧融資嗰時佢再做一個新嘅押記，即係銀行嘅新押記喺上邊咧。咁呢個第一個問題啦。

182
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:44,860
創新及科技局咧，曾經喺二零一九年嘅五月廿一號咧，就有關電議係徵詢工商事務局、誒工商事務委員會嘅意見。

183
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:32,510
開立承擔額，從資本投資基金撥出二十億元，作為給予香港科技園嘅註冊注資股本，而發展咧微電子中心。

184
00:38:45,140 --> 00:39:05,150
誒當時嘅審議時間咧係四十六分鐘嘅啊。咁為咗解答大家嘅問題咧，我哋有誒新任嘅創新及科技局嘅局長咧薛永恆先生咧，同埋佢嘅團隊咧係喺度答大家問題啊。邊位要提問請撳啊！啊，你可以撳鐘啊。陳振英議員五分鐘，唔該。誒，多謝主席。

185
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:25,160
其實舊年誒五月二十一號嘅工商事務委員會討論呢個項目嗰時咧，我都表示咗支持㗎啦。但係咧有幾方面嘅問題咧，想跟進一下。第一個咧就係在工業化資助計劃裏邊咧，就誒我都提過啦，政府用誒一比二，即係政府出一企業出二嘅配對方式咧，就提供資助啦。

186
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:49,660
咁咧，我嗰陣時都講過咧，誒，只係得政府資助三十三個percent嘅比率，但係呢個生產線咧就要設立一個法定壓記。咁會唔會削弱咗呢一個計劃嘅吸引力咧？噉我想問下咧，就係當政府做完呢個法定壓記之後咧，容唔容許呢個項目再對外融資？

187
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:16,820
另外咧就誒，其實前創科局局長喺上次嘅會議嗰時講過咧，雖然政府當局就會為呢個生產線誒設立一個法定壓記啦，但係咧就會畀呢啲獲資助項目咧提供一啲靈活安排嘅，容許佢哋轉移股權，唔係轉移生產線啊，轉移股權或者加入啲新嘅投。

188
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:37,830
噉我想問，如果企業打算做呢啲噉嘅安排，即係引入新股東啊、轉移啊、轉讓啲股權咧，需唔需要政府事先批准嘅咧？如果要批准，咁到時係用咩準則去審議呢啲噉嘅股權轉讓咧？咁又第二個問題。第三咧就係誒關於微電子中心啦，文件就話咧就科技園本來計劃喺

189
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,630
係可以嘅。

190
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,430
莫乃光，餘五分鐘。

191
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:16,700
咁呢個對香港嚟講，可能係機遇定係挑戰咧？一半一半又唔知，因為可能有即係有啲誒國家話要將個生產線搬嚟內地。

192
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:44,740
工業或者生產唔係淨係呢，唔係淨係依樣嘢啊！你睇全世界好多都要自己去生產respirator啊，乜嘢嘢啊噉樣樣嘅工具。誒，咁其實就會發現即係可能誒，我哋其實若果睇闊一啲嘅。

193
00:43:50,080 --> 00:44:06,780
做邊一方面嘅工作，佢係咪做譬如呢啲晶片設計啊等等嘅？咁如果佢係即係做呢一方面嘅誒業務嘅，誒我哋會睇到佢嘅規模，佢係咪有呢個需求係會做到即係用到呢一個微電子中心咧等等嘅？

194
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:57,840
二零二零年初展開呢個改建工程，噉就明年落成嘅。咁但係而家睇嚟撥款個時間都冇咁快啦。咁誒呢個噉嘅項目進度咧，會唔會令到有興趣進駐嗰啲企業咧？佢自己嘅開業計劃有啲影響咧？咁呢個第三個問題。最後一個問題咧就係誒，其實創新科技處處長就。

195
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:17,850
後年喺個會上面就話咧，誒呢個引進嘅微電子誒企業咧，大概係十間，因為我哋用咗二十億嚟投資呢啲設備，咁引進十間噉嘅企業。噉我想問啊，政府對呢啲企業有冇最低嘅投資額先可以進駐？等我哋嘅即係誒。

196
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:42,710
多謝主席，多謝陳議員。其實喺我哋進行相關計劃嗰時候咧，我哋都同翻不同嘅商會同埋團體咧作出去諮詢嘅，都得到佢哋非常之大嘅支持。喺個過程裏邊，我哋睇到咧，如果我哋要吸引一啲高新科技嘅產業嚟到香港咧，政府嘅投資咧係必不可少嘅。當然。

197
00:41:42,830 --> 00:42:02,840
我哋亦都考慮到公堂係要運用得宜，所以喺個溝通嘅過程，我哋理解，如果係可以畀到三分一或者千萬咧，其實對相關嘅企業咧已經有足夠嘅吸引力。當然，我哋會係根據個過程咧，亦都盡量做好個宣傳推廣，從而咧就希望咧多啲企業咧能夠咧係善用我。

198
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:28,720
誒主席，誒就第一個問題咧，嗰個押記嗰樣嘢，誒可唔可以誒？如果對外融資加押咧，噉我哋原則上咧都誒誒覺得係可以嘅，因為佢如果係有多一個押記嘅話咧，佢係一個第二嘅押記嚟嘅，咁喺嗰個排隊嗰個優次咧，其實都係。

199
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:48,730
係政府嗰個壓記先，咁但係我哋嗰個都係預一一個時一個時間嘅啫。咁主要個精神咧就係諗住咧係希望嗰個生產線咧係留翻喺香港，就唔係話嗰頭設立跟住咧就第二年又搬走咗去第二度。咁所以我哋希望嗰個生產線留喺香港嘅啫。咁亦都係因為噉。

200
00:42:48,730 --> 00:43:08,740
咩原因咧？如果佢係轉換股權啊，等等咧，誒住誒加多嘅投資者啊，等等咧，噉我哋原則上亦都係即係誒冇影響誒。我哋對於呢一個生產線嗰個嘅資助嘅，咁當然佢一定要通知我哋，噉我哋都會做翻我哋嘅功夫啦。但係即係基本上咧係。

201
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:29,960
咁至於嗰個誒微電子中心咧，誒我哋舊年喺誒事務委員會答嗰陣時咧，係我哋個預期係會有十間，係基於嗰個本身嗰個設計同埋我哋預計每一間個大小啊咁噉，所以呢個係一個約莫嘅數誒，實際係誒。

202
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:50,080
點樣樣嘅十間咧？咁其實都係要到我哋係可以將佢係即係招租嗰陣時咧，就係會要去睇下嗰啲誒實際每一間嗰個申請。咁誒嗰個投資額咧，我哋而家係冇定一個最低。不過其實佢如果要進駐，我哋一定要睇下佢本身佢係。

203
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:27,070
嗱誒，主席誒，關於阿陳議員亦都提到個時間問題，的而且個應徵翻撥款咧，我哋係本來預期係早啲可以成功爭取到撥款嘅，依家係稍為維持咗，但係都會同翻科技園公司嘅商討咧，我哋係爭取咧喺二零二一或者二二年度咧，我哋希望可以盡早落成有關嘅計劃嘅。多謝主席。

204
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:49,070
主席，我哋誒嗱，首先啊，歡迎啊新嘅局長嚟到誒誒答我哋呢個問題啦。咁誒，我諗誒，我哋講再工業化都講咗好幾年嘅啦。咁當然再工業化咧，誒，我諗香港人有好多對佢有唔同嘅感受啦。有啲即係話即係工乜？

205
00:44:49,070 --> 00:45:09,080
鬼業啦，仲咁有啲又覺得可能餵你講咗，但係講咗幾年都好似未見到有啲咩嘅，即係落地嘅嘢，唔係太多啦。咁誒，但係咧誒，我諗近期因為全球疫情嘅影響之下咧，誒，我諗可能有啲香港人。

206
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:29,090
會有啲唔同嘅體會啦。咁一嚟咧，誒窄啲咁睇，淨係講口罩。咁雖然口罩其實嚴格嚟講就唔係一啲好高嘅科技啦。咁當然你哋會再做啲重用口罩啦，但係我諗都不談不上係一啲即係高端科技啦。咁有啲人又開始睇到，咦，原來可能有啲嘅工

207
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,830
或者新加坡啊，甚至台灣噉樣。

208
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:53,910
咧，依個微電子嘅中心咧，可以喺將來咧，亦都可以支持翻我哋呢個誒微電子依個高新技術嘅發展嘅。

209
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:06,110
因為而家好多國家都覺得一啲重要嘅物資都要生都要自己生產，誒國家地區都好啦，都會有噉嘅感覺，都會有噉嘅需要。

210
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:15,210
係適合未必嚟嗰個誒電子微電子中心，佢可能淨係用我哋嗰個資助計劃都唔頂嘅，但係我哋同每一個都會誒再傾嘅。

211
00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:05,370
或者我補充啊，主席，誒就係誒呢個誒再工業化呢一個我哋個整體呢個策略咧，其實冇變嘅。誒莫議員講得啱嘅，噉我哋誒誒。

212
00:45:45,020 --> 00:46:05,030
可能就同我哋支再支持幾前，再再之前幾年諗嗰啲講嗰啲嘅國在工業化，其實而家係咪一個契機去再諗一諗有啲咩新嘅機遇或者挑戰？因為有機遇有挑戰，機遇可能你而家見到誒全球供應鏈喺度話要重整。

213
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:36,990
咁搬嚟內地，佢會當香港係唔係一個選擇咧？噉樣樣定係香港都係都係都係一國，都係唔都係唔掂嘅？佢認為噉，我我唔知噉，但係你哋會唔會即係喺呢方面？當然誒，過去講再工業化有target目標一啲嘅行業或者一啲嘅技術嘅噉。

214
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:57,000
咁誒當然包括今日講嘅微電子啦，咁但係其實會唔會再去有去去去去諗一諗嗰個策略上邊會唔會因應而家嗰個情況有啲新嘅調整咧？噉我覺得呢個係需要做嘅。誒，我相信反而就唔會太過去否定嗰個所謂再工業化嗰個需要啦。

215
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:26,400
咁但係令誒咁呢個宏觀啲一個問題，睇下你可可唔可以答一答？因為窄啲嘅問題就係喺翻嗰個微電子中心嗰度咧。誒，可唔可以再提一提我哋即係嗰個有關誒嗰個地方嘅選址啊？嗰啲誒喺邊度？可能我哋我都唔記得咗啦。可能即係都要提醒一下我哋啲委員。

216
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:46,410
同埋咧，就係誒嗰個定位上邊係邊類型嘅？我記得嗰陣時有提過，有問過㗎嘛，就係話誒都係已經有公司係表示有興趣，而且啲公司大部分咧係啲海外嘅公司嚟嘅，係咪係咪噉啊？我記得好似係係一個噉嘅回答嘅，咁可唔可以再update一下我哋而家個？

217
00:47:46,410 --> 00:48:06,420
個情況係點咧？唔該，局長。誒，多謝主席。誒，其實莫議員睇得非常之通透。喺翻香港，我哋誒開發嘅產品咧係亦都非常之不錯嘅。但係喺翻個生產過程的而且確，因應翻咁多年嘅發展咧，我哋香港係稍為落後。點樣去將呢個？

218
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:26,430
生產一啲高新技術，我哋能夠拎翻嚟香港，亦都因應翻依家世界嘅一啲嘅轉變咧，我哋可以將個係變成一個機，成一個機遇咧，令我哋香港嘅個工業咧可以再工業化咧噉。依個正正就我哋請大家撥款增加撥款咧嘅目的。喺個過程裏邊，我。

219
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:46,440
係睇到誒，香港嘅工業係非常之有機會咧，喺方面可以發揮所長嘅。因為的而且確，我哋香港本身法律嘅配套，我哋本身人才嘅配套咧，係可以支持相關嘅發展嘅。喺個過程裏邊，我哋誒頭先阿莫議員提到比較窄嘅就係譬如地點啦，我哋而家喺元朗，我已經有個選址㗎啦。噉我哋期望。

220
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:25,930
誒咁誒，我哋喺誒過去傾呢一個計劃嗰陣時咧，其實都係有一啲嘅誒企業已經表示咗興趣，誒有本地嘅，亦都有外地嘅。咁誒當然即係而家隔咗一年啦，亦都因為疫情啦，噉啊個經濟環境都唔同咗，咁所以咧我亦都。

221
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:45,940
都唔即係都都相信咧，大家都會要睇睇未來個計劃係點樣樣。不過，亦都同時誒誒，議員講得啱嘅，因為個疫情咧，亦都有啲新嘅一啲有興趣嘅誒投資誒，做一啲新嘅生產線嘅一啲企業嘅，係同之前嘅係有啲唔同。

222
00:49:45,940 --> 00:50:05,950
嘅，譬如有啲係咪一啲噉嘅重要物資咧？咁如果係啲重要物資嘅，亦都有一啲係基本啲嘅，但係有啲咧都係有啲知識產權重啲嘅。咁所以咧就其實都係有一個新嘅機遇咯。咁所以誒呢啲咧，我哋都係會同呢啲有興趣嘅企業咧係繼續去傾，噉就睇下邊啲。

223
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:35,960
姚思榮議員五分鐘。誒，多謝主席。就誒有關在工業化啦，主要都係針對啲新嘅智能生產線。咁希望香港喺工業嗰個進一步提升我哋嘅國際或者嗰個影響力啦。咁誒，但係呢方面我睇周邊都係有興趣嘅，包括內地。

224
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,480
呢個四個問題。

225
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,540
嘅人嘅人數要求係點樣樣？

226
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,580
個誒呢方面嘅指標要求嘅咧？

227
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,060
誒再工業化嘅發展咧，都係有幫助嘅。

228
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,790
吸引人才、培育人才，我哋會有一個嘅支持。

229
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:15,560
就應該係優先畀內地嘅商家先㗎嘛，啊咁呢方面我哋係咪都係一視同仁，還是有個即係優先嘅誒次序安排嘅咧？嚇？

230
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:59,120
咁喺呢方面，誒呢個政策出台咧，誒我哋嘅優勢點樣咧？即係一比二啊，千五萬呢個嘅優勢點樣？包括税收方面，我哋同鄰近地方比，或者我哋會唔會誒喺税收方面再諗一啲減免，誒使到個吸引力更加大啲咧？呢個第一問題。

231
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:19,130
第二個就係有關有冇要個規模同埋請人個個要求啊，即係你話誒我抌咁多錢，噉你話最少要達到某個規模先得咧，係嘛？咁誒，如果唔係有啲可能好細，咁誒誒又做；有啲好大，你又你又食唔到。咁呢方面誒有個規模要求同請。

232
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:41,830
第三個就係有關誒香香有冇要求嗰個香港人同海外誒人才嘅比比例，因為誒文件都有講啦，就係香港都有呢方面嘅人才啊。咁誒誒有啲內地或者海外國家都有要求，係誒即係請翻百分之幾嘅本地人。咁香港呢方面有冇一？

233
00:51:45,000 --> 00:52:05,010
噉啊，第四就係有關誒，即係嗰個有冇問過我哋香港嘅商家有冇興趣嚇？噉啊就誒，如果係商家有興趣，係咪佢哋優先嘅先？誒，我攞出嚟誒，都係海外同埋香港商家公平競爭喺呢方面，我嘅我知道誒，內地咧。

234
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:37,770
誒，代主席，姚議員嘅提問第一部分就係講到我哋點樣有一個配套推動翻我哋誒再工業化，亦都一個高新技術嘅發展。喺一個過程裏邊，當然我哋依家係申請誒大家嘅支持咧，就可以有一個撥款，令到我哋可以一個資助嘅計劃。其實整體政府嘅政策，無論喺

235
00:52:42,070 --> 00:53:02,080
喺嗰個研發，我哋亦都有一個税務嘅優惠。我哋唔會將所有嘅誒等埋一張文件咧，就請大家一次過審核嘅。其實我哋喺不同嘅環節咧，亦都會税務、人才培訓、財政資助等等，我哋都係着力係做相關嘅工作。咁喺個誒高新技術咧。

236
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:22,090
其實好多時候咧，誒都係一個相對自動化嘅，所以咧就因應翻唔同嘅項目咧，佢可能人手嘅需要咧會有所不同，所以咧喺依方面咧，我哋比較難咧，就喺個階段咧就決定人手嘅需要。不過我想強調咧，只要嗰個工業係嚟到香港，整體嘅配套咧，無論

237
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:42,100
無論係喺嗰個誒金融嘅配套、誒其他誒物流嘅配套，都會帶嚟咧香港一個嘅誒人力資源嘅市場一個改善嘅。咁未必一定喺個工廠或者個生產線裏邊咧需要好多個人手，甚至有啲生產線咧，我哋叫做誒黑暗工廠啊。意思咧就唔使開燈，我哋咧就完全咧。

238
00:53:42,100 --> 00:54:02,110
就可以無人化，都可以推動到相關嘅工作嘅。咁但係當然生產線係有維修保養，係有安裝等等依啲咧物料嘅供應，依啲可以帶嚟咧香港一個嘅即係人力資源嘅一個嘅提升咯。咁其他嘅，我請阿秘書長嚟睇。係誒誒誒，主席誒，至於係咪誒香港？

239
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:22,120
講嘅商家優先咧，其實咧，我哋誒主要嗰個要求咧，嗰個資助計劃咧，就係一啲誒香港誒成立嘅公司。噉佢嗰個股東喺邊度嚟？係咪香港人嗰啲咧？我哋係即係呢個就唔係我哋嗰個考慮嘅一個因素嚟嘅。噉佢一間香港誒成立嘅公司，噉就可以嘅。

240
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:42,130
咁誒，其實主要嘅，我哋覺得咧，香港不朽嘅優勢咧，好似阿局長講，就係我哋都吸引到全世界誒一啲嘅誒最最優秀嘅一啲嘅科研嘅嘅誒機構啊、人才啊嚟香港。如果我哋做到呢一樣咧，我哋其實都唔介意嘅，即係佢嚟到嘅話咧，根本就係對我哋成個創科嘅發展。

241
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,730
佢哋係有興趣嘅。

242
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,110
誒誒，原材料誒或者零件嘅一個嘅問題，第二個咧就係。

243
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:03,470
電梯師傅嚟幫手，揾咗啲係地鐵師傅嚟幫手，揾咗啲船廠嘅師傅嚟幫手，因為都係行行氣行電嘅啫。

244
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:54,460
而家好似我哋嗰度行得到咧，我哋揾咗好多唔同嘅公眾嘅人嚟幫手，包括之前阿局長坐嘅誒誒機電工程署，我哋揾到啲。

245
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:24,800
裝機啊誒，即使你講啱啱誒文件裏面都有講到一個嘅誒誒安裝，可能係啲誒唔需要人手啊。呢個當然做口罩其實都唔需要人手，好少啫嘛。但係你裝機都冇人識裝啊嘛。

246
00:54:45,620 --> 00:55:05,630
有有冇問過啲香港商家興趣大唔大啊？有冇問過咩咁？誒，主席有嘅。我哋其實喺制定呢一個計劃嗰陣時咧，我哋係有同幾大商會啦，尤其是係同呢一方面有興趣嘅誒企業咧，係有直接嘅接觸嘅。噉係誒，都佢哋都有好多咧，係有表示興趣。

247
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:25,640
有啲係想生誒一啲成立一啲新嘅生產線，亦都有啲咧係想將佢哋原有嘅生產線最高增值嗰部分咧係擺嚟擺翻係擺嚟香港。噉我諗都係睇到香港喺呢一方面，譬如知識產權嘅保護啊、誒法律制度啊等等嗰方面嘅優勢咧，所以佢。

248
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:47,480
好，下一位何啓明議員五分鐘。誒誒，多謝主席。主席，其實誒，喂誒，五分鐘啊。多謝主席。主席，其實我哋係工聯會係贊成呢個嘅撥款，但係咧，我想透過呢個誒呢呢個議程咧，想同阿阿局長去講翻咧。其實啱啱你嘅裡面有講一點咧，係我唔認同嘅，就係咧，你話香港有好多。

249
00:55:47,480 --> 00:56:07,490
噉嘅人才嘅配套咧，我呢個喺我哋做口罩呢幾個月時間咧，即係作為一個嘅議員咧，我真係好有深入感受。根本香港冇人才誒，我知可能阿阿Ivan佢之前幫我哋去誒聯繫好多咧。其實我哋好多謝創新科技處去做呢個嘅口罩嘅誒工作，但係咧誒其實喺。

250
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:27,500
喺成件事咧，我哋見到成日香港講再工業化呢件事咧，係有個好大嘅需要。誒，我覺得係好大嘅需要改變嘅一個地方。誒，你冇睇個口罩係得備線、耳繩同埋誒熔噴布，其實咧呢幾樣嘢香港都冇嘅，所以初期咧香港想做自己做口罩，我諗係冇人做得到。誒。

251
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:47,740
當然，我哋誒好過好多地方去做採購之後咧，其實都係要經過內地。但係大家知道疫情期間咧，係冇辦法翻去睇料，所以咧大家誒，所以買條備線咧都我哋都買退咗好多批貨，因為備線只要唔啱部機咧，已經你又冇得翻去東莞去睇一啲料咧，根本成批熱備線已經用唔到㗎啦，所以。

252
00:56:47,740 --> 00:57:07,750
所以咧，誒呢個係其一啦。我哋香港係誒，你話要再工業化，我哋要適量嘅自己嘅本地嘅啲零配件咧，都要我哋自己做。講真，誒我唔係話全部要都，我不可能嘅呢個都係。但係例如我哋而家要啤翻工聯會三個字喺翻我哋自家口罩度咧，其實個配件我都要等喺喺國內去運翻落嚟。呢個就係香港冇呢啲噉嘅。

253
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:45,220
講真誒，而家我唔知，可能阿阿阿Jeremy Jeremy喺度。阿佢佢嗰部機可能行得好啲啊，我哋都行得到。但係確實香港識裝機嘅人咧冇啊。我如果你誒，如果Jeremy可能補補補充翻，香港係大師級得一個嘅啫，因為原本冇噉嘅生產線，冇人冇人培育過出嚟，我哋。

254
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:24,050
否則嘅話咧，等得到誒有批得到有師傅肯喺內地落嚟咧，其實就根本就唔使整啦。我哋至少而家出到幾萬個人噉啊，令到咧香港嘅口罩供應咧有翻啲穩定。但係咧，而家你話人才好足夠咧，所以呢個我就唔係咁認同，因為我哋而家你話大學畢業出嚟咧係有高誒上游嘅人才。

255
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:44,060
但係你去到好中端嘅人才咧，香港係缺嘅，冇人曉裝機嘅。阿處長、阿局長、秘書長，即係你嗰個你冇咗呢批中間呢缺噉嘅人咧，其實根本就部機行唔喐。所以我知道，即係我之前都講過好多。我知道程教主而家攞咗部機嘅，全部都係人，你冇人識，冇冇人識去搞嗰部機，冇人識教。

256
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,690
重新嘅佈局啊！

257
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:50,510
最所以呢個就係一個嘅，我想同啊局長去分享，希望咧真係有啲嘅誒。

258
00:58:44,060 --> 00:59:04,070
搞咁咪送咗畀懲教署咯，因為懲教署有工場㗎嘛。我知道係噉，所以咧誒，其實呢啲就變相係一個嘅誒反映香港再工業化咧，係有一個係要改變嘅地方。我覺得就係咧，早幾年我哋嘅再工業化咧太過集中喺一啲喺雲端嘅地方。我明白呢個會增大個GDP嘅，但問題係點樣係可以令到？

259
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:24,080
帶動到我哋香港嗰個嘅工業有啲改變咧，你冇一啲終端嘅人才去幫手去配套咧，誒呢個係一個好大嘅決心。無論喺呢件事裡面見到，或者平時我哋見到喺製衣業也好，製衣業你喺終端人才你冇，而家冇人識幫你去做樣做版㗎。你製衣業訓練工你出嚟嘅人，你冇辦法去做用得到，因為佢哋冇。

260
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:44,090
工作機會誒，我哋再工業化。如果唔喺呢個方向，我我明白可能要有啲特定嘅方向要揀嘅。但係如果我哋唔去誒畀一啲機會本地嘅人去誒做一啲中端中游嘅工作，咁咧其實咧就會係講好聽又好聽啦。但係做唔做到嘢出嚟咧誒？

261
00:59:50,790 --> 01:00:10,800
可能一啲步調，可能你要調，就諗下咪要調整。噉就誒，聽局長有冇回應咧？誒，主席，何議員嘅分析其實都好反映香港嘅情況。其實香港曾經喺工業都非常之輝煌，但係一段嘅時間咧，因應翻我哋個經濟嘅發展咧，我哋中間嘅技術人。

262
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:30,810
才咧技術人員咧的而且確係即係依家開始係缺乏啦。其實正正就因為可能依個一個雞蛋同雞嘅問題啊，你有依個噉樣嘅需求，你有噉樣嘅生產線去做相關嘅工業嘅技術咧，我係先至有個人才嘅需求。咁但係當依方面我哋

263
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:50,820
未有個需求咧，人才慢慢就會流失。我哋透過今次嘅資助計劃，引一啲嘅工業線翻返嚟香港，而啲工業線係適合香港作為一個高新技術開發嘅一個推動嘅。咁從而咧，我哋就可以令到嗰啲技術嘅人才咧有咗個需求，然後咧先至。

264
01:00:50,820 --> 01:01:10,830
可以咧，等佢哋有所發揮。其實喺政府誒推動依家我哋嘅STEM教育，我哋個目標亦都係睇到，除咗係高端嘅誒開發技術人才之餘咧，我哋中間我哋個技術工人咧，其實亦都係一個香港發展一個好重要源動力嚟嘅。其實我哋喺不同嘅環節都做緊相應嘅。

265
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:30,840
配套講翻頭先，何議員講嘅誒，我哋喺羅湖嗰個生產線咧，其實係我哋香港嘅工人、技術工人，最後因為誒本身嗰個生產線嘅人才不能夠嚟香港，我哋自己香港工人去砌電，依個當然係困難嘅，但係我都期望發展啊！好啊，好啊，阿學長。

266
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:20,220
在香港製造係由香港製造依個噉嘅概念咧，能夠傳出去全世界。咁但係當然，我我強調。

267
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:08,910
就可以用得到啊！真係落到地咧，咁呢個我有有啲憂慮。噉我都想睇下你哋嗰個評估係點。第二咧就係。

268
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:52,350
府嘅定位，除咗係一個傳統嘅我一個服務提供者、規管者之外咧，我哋亦都係一個促成者，同一個推廣者。

269
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:23,120
講喺全世界，或者你督促嗰間公司都要咁做啦嚇，做到畀人哋聽呢個Made in Hong Kong嘅品牌咧。嗱，事實上好老實講。

270
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:50,850
我唔再講啦，啊主席，我希望咧啊啊局長咧可以用翻之前你喺機電工程署一啲嘅學徒計劃咧，其實我哋誒呢個係受到行業好大嘅一個嘅誒鼓舞啊！希望你可以將呢個計劃帶翻落去呢個新嘅角度咧，去香幫香港做翻呢啲噉嘅技術人才。唔該，主席，一定盡力啊。好，周浩鼎完五分鐘。好。

271
01:01:51,410 --> 01:02:11,420
誒唔該啊，主席。當然我係歡迎啊，政府推出誒再工業化嘅呢個誒配套啦。噉我就有啲意見想講講嘅，就係嗱，第一咧誒再工業化，我相信無論係我本人或者我哋好多嘅同事咧，其實都係非常關注，因為呢個都係幫我哋香港。

272
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:31,430
啊，一個經濟嘅出路嘅契機，特別咧係我最近都啊喺唔同場合都有表達過。由於今日嗰個疫情喺全世界發生嘅情況咧，其實亦都導致全世界各國對於啊各種嘅生產基地咧，佢係有機會會有一個所謂reshuffle，即係有一個嘅啊，即係。

273
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:52,980
咁當然咧，而家我哋國家即係內地喺誒大灣區過去嘅生產基地係有一定嘅優勢，因為做內地做得好咧，其實其中一樣嘢就係因為個供應鏈好全面。例如話你做一樣嘢，誒零件嘅部件喺成條供應鏈，你喺附近嘅。

274
01:02:52,980 --> 01:03:12,990
地方佢可以完全攞到曬嘅，其實內地就係做呢個供應鏈嘅生產基地，就係做到呢個優勢。所以有啲人話誒搬廠搬廠，其實都誒後來諗下咧，三思而後行咧，都未必真係會咁做。咁反而咧，我就覺得而家香港嘅契機咧，就正正啊，正如而家我哋見到文件裏面寫咧。

275
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:33,400
既然有一個生產佈局嘅重新佈局嘅安排咧，我覺得香港就更加係把握做高端嗰一part部分，或者調翻轉咧，將最重要、最難做嗰一部分咧，可能擺喺香港。噉我覺得都符合我哋嗰個定位嘅。咁但係我想喺度咧，就提出一個問題咧，就係嗱，其實我哋而家政府就

276
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:53,410
住今次呢一個嘅注資嘅安排啦，將來咧，我見到文件寫咧就係話政府嗰個資助同埋嗰個企業咧，誒對比就係一比二嘅。咁誒呢個當然就係一個投入，亦都應該係有一啲嘅配套，講到明限制。我抌咗錢落去，我唔能夠話畀你做完之後你又賣盤，或者你真係～

277
01:03:53,410 --> 01:04:13,420
走去中間轉手畀第二個啦。咁呢個我都絕對係認為啱，但係我都仲有一樣嘢需要做嘅，就係你哋可唔可以講下畀我聽咧？喺未來嘅鋪排上面嚟講，例如話有啲錢揼咗喺呢間公司做咗啦，佢一路營運落去嘅時候，你點樣可以做好啲嘅市場推廣？

278
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:43,560
我哋花咗咁多資源，唔單止希望喺香港淨係單單製造就業嘅製造就業當然緊要啦，但係更重要咧，其實喺經濟上嚟講，我都覺得如果衝出世界話到畀人哋聽，我哋香港呢個新嘅品牌做到出嚟係得咧，其實所帶出嚟嘅再大嘅經濟效應會更。

279
01:04:43,560 --> 01:05:03,570
更加好嘅噉，所以我覺得咧，就係做完之後點樣去做好市場推廣咧，反而咧係呢個部分部分非常之緊要。噉我都想借呢個機會就聽一聽，即係政府有冇話畀佢聽，你有冇啲咩計劃或者諗法啦？嚇，點樣可以導致到嗰啲公司當佢嗰啲產品開始嚟啦，做啦？

280
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:23,760
誒當然佢要賺錢，最好要做到啦。第二就係盡量要喺全世界做一個有效嘅推廣，去話畀人哋聽。呢個就係一個香港嘅新品牌。噉你做落去，做慢慢落去，你先可以推廣到嗰個地方啊。噉我哋見到世界上，例如話過去德國就好成功，咁新加坡啊。

281
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:43,770
啊！以色列啊！呢啲咧都係做到相應嘅東西，令到全世界人都認識佢呢個品牌。咁所以，我覺得呢個可唔可以啊？局長或者相關方面官員可以講講畀我哋聽，有冇咩計劃咁咧？唔該，局長、主席、周議員嘅誒，剛才所講嘅正正就係我哋今屆政府希望做得到嘅。我哋今屆政

282
01:05:52,630 --> 01:06:12,640
其實喺個高新科技，我哋個開發係政府係有好大嘅資助。譬如今次嘅撥款，亦都係希望透過個財務嘅安排咧，能夠多啲高新科技翻到嚟香港。但係跟住我所做嘅就係話，要將呢啲產品咧有效噉樣去推廣到全世界，令到知道香港製造。

283
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:30,020
講實係邊個項目嘅？咁但係我哋係會誒，即係會睇考慮呢啲因素。好啊，誒嗱，因為我哋七點鐘完啊，最後一位，康俊裕議員。

284
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:39,830
同埋誒其他國家嘅市場咧，主席。誒，主席誒，我先答個議員最後嗰部分，關於政府採購政策嗰度嘅，我想提翻咧，其實喺上年嘅。

285
01:09:49,320 --> 01:10:07,230
都係因為香港誒政府唔肯優先採用咧，就結果就畀人買咗，即係外國買咗，噉啊變成外國嘅產品誒，就再推出，即係打翻翻轉頭先翻嚟香港嘅噉樣。咁譬如我哋今次政府既然係誒即係落水啦，一齊去投資啦，噉。

286
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:40,920
路程係要一步一步行嘅。首先，我哋要有個生產線喺翻香港先。我哋要培養好我哋香港嘅人才。但係咧，頭先周議員所講，正正就係我哋將來一定要做，由開發、確認，最後咧就係商品化，然後呢個要推廣商品。

287
01:06:40,920 --> 01:07:00,930
咧就我哋未來我哋香港需要做嘅工作，誒細節嘅，我諗我哋稍後機會再同翻阿周議員同埋相關議員咧做個報告。但係我想咧強調，呢個一定係我哋嘅方向。好，郭佩凡議員五分鐘。係啊，多謝主席。咁首先啊，歡迎局長出席今日嘅會議啦。咁噉就誒，我當然。

288
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:20,940
咧就係誒支持呢一個嘅撥款嘅噉，我亦都即係認同咧，就係誒香港咧係有條件咧可以喺誒高新科技方邊咧，即係高增值產業方邊咧就可以即係再工業化嘅。咁咧，我有幾個問題想問咧。第一咧就係誒，即係誒而家本即係今天喺香港嗰個狀

289
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:40,950
狀況咧，其實就誒，即係我哋面對內憂外患啦，啊天災人禍，噉就誒早前咧，其實我哋都已經有好多誒投資嘅項目咧，無論係外國對香港嘅投資或者本地嘅投資項目咧，都因為啊反修例嘅風波同埋疫情嘅影響咧，其實都hold住曬嘅。咁所以誒而家誒你哋推出呢一

290
01:07:40,950 --> 01:08:00,960
個項目咁當然係好啦，咁但係誒，即係你哋有冇評估過嗰個影響咧？即係會唔會原本話有興趣投資嘅誒，即係或者有興趣嘅誒公司企業咧，而家都打退堂鼓啊，或者要等一等先啊，諗一諗先啊？誒，你哋覺得誒而家譬如撥款咗二十億，係咪真係誒，即係好快？

291
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:29,200
誒，當你哋去誒嚟緊選擇嘅時候咧，其實會唔會有strategic points嘅咧？即係係咪有策略性嘅誒評估啊？即係誒，譬如防啊，即係抗疫啊、防疫啊呢啲啊，即係我哋而家知道，我哋面對全世界都面對咩嘅困難啦。未來我哋可能都有其他嘅一啲啊，一啲嘅。

292
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:49,210
物資咧，其實係誒有本地生產咧，其實係好重要嘅。噉就誒呢一方面會唔會都係一個誒考慮嘅方向？誒喺誒即係推動新嘅誒工業嘅時候咧，其實都係誒有一啲戰略性嘅嘅嘅嘅產業咧，係誒即係工廠咧，係我哋即係首要嘅。

293
01:08:49,210 --> 01:09:09,220
誒誒考慮加分嘅會噉，而嗰啲係乜嘢咧？即係有冇做過study，有冇做過評估嘅咧？咁咁另外咧，即係以往誒我哋誒高新科技嘅誒產品咧，誒即係都係好多波折嘅香港嘅發展。我哋有好多嘅產品咧，誒即係香港開始做研發嘅，但係去。

294
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:29,230
到真係要誒落實製作啊、製造啊，同埋推出市場嘅時候咧，都會面對幾幾個大嘅困難。第一就係即係香港生產唔到啦，因為冇地方冇人手。咁而家如果政府話誒有噉樣嘅資助啦，咁但係人人才人手方面係咪誒會足夠咧？即係未來喺誒我哋嘅。

295
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:49,240
誒大學裏邊嘅人才配套，我哋有冇適當嘅調整去配，即係去調調整去配合我哋呢個再工業化咧？第二咧就係誒，我哋成日都話咧，香港研發出嚟嘅嘢咧，我哋香港自己唔用嘅，尤其香港政府咧就唔會優先採用嘅，噉就令到咧個市場唔喺香港咧，我哋研發個好多嘢咧。

296
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:27,520
誒即係會去支持呢個再工業化嘅，咁誒當而你哋揀呢啲嘅項目咧，都係覺得對香港係係好嘅。咁政府會唔會係優先去採用呢啲生產出嚟嘅誒產品嘅咧？因為香港政府嘅job reference其實係好重要㗎嘛。如果你生產出嚟嘅嘢香港政府都唔用嘅，噉我哋點樣開拓內地？

297
01:10:40,230 --> 01:11:00,240
誒四月，我哋咧已經有一個新嘅政府採購政策，主要目的係支持創新嘅產品，可以咧係得到政府嘅優先採用。簡單講個過程咧，我哋係將我哋嘅採購咧係分開咗兩個主要部分，一個就係技術水平，第二個當然就係佢嗰。

298
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:47,240
創新科技推廣唔係淨係開發。

299
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,620
創新科技其實咧係一個非常之廣闊嘅範疇嚟嘅。

300
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:45,840
個合作咧可以更加有力。不過，我想強調啊，鄺議員，誒，創新科技啊，其實一個非常非常廣闊嘅範圍。

301
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:53,910
我再強調，工程、醫療、物流等等都可以用到創新科技嘅。

302
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:34,870
非常之有能力，亦都非常之投入嘅，即係創新科技成員。我希望咧，大家咧就畀時間我哋。

303
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:43,920
政府同埋我哋創新科技界做好個合作，其實今日申請嘅撥款，正正就係想將依件事咧做好。

304
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:17,890
需要啲咩嘅科技？有啲咩問題？我等緊科技去解決。依個噉嘅平台咧，短短嘅兩三年間咧，已經有超過。

305
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:28,790
咁包括工程、醫療等等，咁依個咁廣闊嘅範疇咧，我相信咧我都唔夠膽講每一個行業嘅成員咧，我都會同佢係一個朋友。

306
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:26,510
誒驚天動地嘅成績，因為創新科技咧係要時間嘅，係啲亦都要大家共同投入嘅。不過我有信心，因為喺個過程裏邊，我哋真係香港有一班好好。

307
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:20,250
嗰個誒價錢喺技術水平嗰度咧，我哋係最少最少啊，係百分之二十，係屬於一個創新嘅水平。其實依個工作咧，我覺得係一個非常之大嘅一個推動，因為政府本身可能有幾十個部門，我哋都會好努力一齊去推廣，去採用。

308
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:40,260
一啲先進科技，但係支持呢幾十個部門嘅運作咧，其實有好多不同嘅承辦商、供應商嘅。透過依個支持創新嘅採購政策咧，我哋將幾十個部門嘅推廣能力咧，係擴散到我哋數以百計嘅供應商同埋承辦商，為我哋一齊去揾一啲。

309
01:11:40,260 --> 01:12:00,270
啲創新嘅科技、創新嘅技術咧，係提升政府嘅服務。誒，依個政策已經落咗地，已經咧就行咗一年多啦。個誒，我期望咧喺未來嘅時間咧，我哋可以透過相關嘅政策咧，可以做得更加好、更加多嘅創新技術咧，可以提升政府服務。記得我請阿秘書長講。秘書長，好誒。

310
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:20,280
多謝主席。嗯誒，至於嗰個評估誒嗰個影響咧，就誒會有嘅，一定有嘅。即係喺誒，譬如個疫情啊，誒呢誒誒呢一兩年嗰個誒成個全球嗰個經濟啊，或者嗰啲貿易嘅爭拗啊噉，對於嗰啲本來我哋喺。

311
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:40,290
制定呢一個嘅誒資助計劃之前，都傾咗嘅嗰啲企業咧。誒，我諗佢哋都會要諗一諗誒，成個未來嘅發展係點樣樣咧。咁呢個我都不否認嘅。誒不過咧，就同時咧，呢個疫情咧，亦都睇到咧有新嘅一啲契機，誒有啲新嘅誒誒投資者咧。

312
01:12:40,290 --> 01:13:00,300
就會有興趣咧，就投資一啲新嘅一啲項目。咁亦都有同我哋係接觸，噉我哋亦都同佢哋傾緊嘅。咁所以覺得係有危有機咯。咁所以有新人或者亦都有誒誒有有有舊人或者即係有誒本來嘅企業或者會打退堂鼓，但係亦都有新嘅有興趣。咁有啲咧誒，我哋嗰個有咩？

313
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:20,310
策略嘅評估咧，咁其實咧就誒主要咧，我哋成個再工業化政策咧，都係睇一啲誒以知識產權為本啦，誒以科技為本啦。咁經過今次疫情，我哋當然亦都會睇一啲重要嘅物資係咪即係都係特別係喺香港係會需要咧。咁噉我諗好難講。

314
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:50,310
誒多謝主席。咁首先，今次係阿薛局長第一次用即係創新及科技局局長嚟到立法會答我哋嘅問題啦。噉樣噉啊，同阿局長傾下偈啦。咁因為咧就誒，大家都有一個嘅即係行內有個聲音啊，個講法就係話咧，就覺得阿局長就即係同行內嘅人士唔相熟啊。噉啊，可能好。

315
01:13:50,310 --> 01:14:10,320
好多行業即係行內人士都唔認識局長嘅，咁亦都感覺上就擔心啊。局長你咧就可能亦都唔熟嗰個行業即係推動創科方面噉，或者我畀個時間你講一講，或者因為其實好多朋友可能睇緊呢個直播嘅噉樣，你點樣誒可以即係説服大家我係一個稱職或者好嘅創科局局長咧？

316
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:49,080
咁但係咧，就喺我過往誒三十幾年嘅公務工作裏邊咧，我亦都同咗不同嘅創科界別嘅朋友咧係有個接觸，有個合作。譬如話近幾年嘅，為咗推動我哋香港特區政府嘅同事可以多啲不同嘅創新科技可以善用，提升佢哋服務咧。

317
01:14:49,080 --> 01:15:09,090
我哋基建工程署係一個叫做創新科技協作平台，咁咧就係吸引我哋香港嘅創新科技界嘅朋友咧，為我哋政府部門提供一啲嘅科技答案。而另一方面，我哋亦都請我哋政府部門嘅朋友咧，就係話翻畀啲科技公司聽，我哋。

318
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:38,180
誒應該講二百個嘅不同嘅方案咧，已經咧可以做緊個配對，咁亦都有好多好幾十個已經落咗底。為咗能夠更加有力嘅推動我哋嘅合作咧，我係同咗五間大學、七個我哋主要嘅科研機構咧，係簽咗個合作協議，咁從而咧令到我哋嗰。

319
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,980
我哋今日時間夠啦嚇，現在咧係散會。

320
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:39,180
大學嘅創科界朋友咧，佢都對我非常之瞭解嘅。我亦都用翻原本嘅網絡，希望再擴大嘅網絡。咁已經開始約緊業界朋友咧，係可以多見面、多溝通。多謝亞港議員，多謝主席嚇。

321
01:15:54,190 --> 01:16:14,200
我會喺未來嘅時間更加努力噉樣咧，同翻不同嘅創新界別嘅朋友咧，去誒做一個認識，期望佢哋咧可以同我哋一齊咧，為香港嘅創新科技去推動。我唔想講話誒，我哋一定可以誒喺短期之內為香港會做到乜嘢誒？

322
01:16:47,520 --> 01:17:07,530
我哋要有個生產商品化嘅過程。我哋依家講緊就係幫我哋將個創新科技有一個生產線喺我哋香港，所以其實一個重中之重。如果咪研發咗、開發咗之後咧，我哋送畀其他地方嘅朋友去幫我哋做生產咧，唔係唔得。但係點解我哋唔可以喺香港自己？

323
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:27,540
都適合嘅地方做翻，我哋能夠有能力嘅高創新科技嘅生產咧。咁呢個，所以我就懇請我哋即係議會咧，能夠協助我哋創新科技界，亦都為香港帶嚟一個新嘅經濟嘅動力，去推動我哋民生嘅發展。所以誒，我覺得誒，我哋嘅工作非常之有意義。我。

324
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:47,550
期待同我創新科技界朋友咧一齊加強合作，為香港經濟民生嘅改善咧係盡出一分力嘅。多謝主席。啊，主席，我就冇打斷局長嘅。據瞭解，即係局長，我唔知啦。睇新聞就係話呢個禮拜先知道哦，我要做局長啦。咁當然即係都要即係適適應個新環境。OK，噉啊，我又唔敢問你太仔細。

325
01:17:47,550 --> 01:18:07,560
嘅東西，我想問嘅啫。嗱，頭先我提咧就係一啲業界就話即係唔認識你。嗱，以往咧創科畀人感覺就係個局咧就不斷派錢，噉我屋企派錢都製造咗一個土壤嘅得以體確，而個再工業化就係回應緊我哋嘅社嗰個嘅世界嘅大趨勢，即係四點零嗰個趨勢。噉啊，亦都根據疫情關係有一啲嘅口罩嘅。

326
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:27,570
回緊翻嚟啦，咁噉啊誒。至於落嚟有咩表現，係拭目以待。但係，我想問一問頭先針對我話業界對你唔認識，噉你短期之內會點樣回應？會唔會約啲業界即刻見下面，或者有個時間表啦？已經噉樣啦，青石百分之百會誒，透過不同嘅朋友嘅支持咧，因為正如剛才講，我有一班大。
