1
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,360
呢個係突然。

2
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,040
Of course you didn't. You wouldn't dare.

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,380
你你 people， actually ask her。

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,640
and had to cancel her policy address today.

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,860
到，the end of next month。

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,900
會議人數已夠，請議員返回座位。會議繼續，冇問題，議員。

7
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,520
這 Legislature is supposed to make laws to pass laws.

8
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,840
Did the president of this council object? I doubt it very much. Again, he wouldn't dare.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,720
Cancel for today? Can it be just delayed for one week till next Wednesday?

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:13,620
Isn't that the most ludicrous arrangement this council has ever seen?

11
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:54,340
We're allowed to each legislator at least to talk about what should have happened today.

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:29,040
It must be a huge coincidence that Kerry Lam got summoned up to Shenzhen.

13
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:31,540
did he have could he have actually asked Carrie Lam that maybe the policy address should come back earlier

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:10,890
how did that national security law get effected in Hong Kong? It clearly bypassed this legislature.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:01:01,030
postponement of her policy address is now the being scheduled for hopefully she said quote and unquote Kerry Lamb said.

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:45,690
毛孟靜議員請你換翻去二零一九年成文法雜誌規定條例草案議會嘅有關條文嘅內容。

17
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,020
nou。

18
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,330
and their likes.

19
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,340
justice。

20
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,760
those people.

21
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,460
with a big J.

22
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,320
We are talking about.

23
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,660
There's a miscellaneous provisions.

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,190
Now today, not only we didn't have Kerry Lamb, we didn't even have the secretary for.

25
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:48,890
What Tony Che和What's her name Priscilla Law have said?

26
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,870
All very technical and supposedly uncontroversial amendments.

27
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:07,540
I mean, the G. God knows what that means. Never mind. I have no legal training whatsoever, but.

28
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:57,930
啊， so， I know you are quite right， Priscilla Long。 How could I have got that surname wrong？

29
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:36,020
business is an omnibus bill to try to make amendments to a number of ordinances, and basically, basically, it's a

30
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:15,150
They can only believe what the authorities have to tell them, because they couldn't even believe in themselves. They're just very gullible sponges.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:58,400
I didn't just flick through the documents. I had a thorough read of what's in there. I mean, things like we repealed the word sitting and substituted with the word acting.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:41,810
在這裡，因為她也受到兩條法律的限制。我剛剛要提醒你，如果你再翻翻入二零一九年成法集項規定條例草案，係我要處理法律。請你立即翻翻二零一九年成法集規定嘅條例草案內容。

33
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,200
to speed.

34
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,560
Bracket cap four.

35
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,580
speed says everything.

36
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
但， do we actually sacrifice?

37
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,950
We're also talking about justice.

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,550
我係得，rather taken aback。

39
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,490
all the way along this argument.

40
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,940
但這不是隻係一個行政嘅exercise。

41
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,710
We're supposed to be talking about the reasonable, practical, feasible amendments.

42
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,870
一 set mechanism， an established way of due diligence.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,240
作為一 layman， as I go through the amendment to the High Court ordinance.

44
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:08,830
justices of appeal， now three or more. Originally, it's three plus.

45
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:18,540
Could be more than three, and now you're going to cut it down to two. This just doesn't sound right.

46
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:55,200
They claim there's a huge a backlog, the the sheer volume of the the suits and the cases sitting awaiting hearing. It's just too huge.

47
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:59,820
To speed things up, we need to expedite things. Okay, so I looked at the original wording of that ordinance, and it says something like the court consisting of three or more.

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:42,250
It's essentially cutting down the number of judges sitting at a court to hear essentially cases the stemming from reform claims. There's a huge backlog, so we had.

49
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,190
要被charge with rioting these days。

50
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,140
what are you doing about that sort of backlogs?

51
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,090
amendments are meant to be improving, to better.

52
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,870
Here we're talking about civil suits. Okay, fine. I know.

53
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,050
existing ordinances, existing laws, of course.

54
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,830
with all those clearly arbitrary charges.

55
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,190
Are you not trying to jam Hong Kong's courts at the same time?

56
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:22,740
係，係，係。係。

57
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:51,620
even a layman like me could read. Some of the charges were so frivolous, so arbitrary. You don't have to be at the scene on site.

58
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:45,240
哦，maybe you're not， you you you have no intention of jamming the courts， you just want to use the judiciary as your political weapon， don't you？

59
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:23,410
There are justifications to all these amendments. The general wording is that there's a need to introduce an omnibus bill to make miscellaneous amendments to various ordinances.

60
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:54,540
Not every single one of them, okay? So, okay, these amendments are useful for the purpose of updating or improving the relevant legislation.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:39,910
And talking about backlogs, and it's most curious, because at the moment at our court, the huge number of cases involving charges of rioting.

62
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:17,700
The Justice Department, you owe the Hong Kong people a huge explanation. You have to explain yourself clearly. How are you going to deal with that sort of criminal case backlogs?

63
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:41,150
Why? Because, well, while on the one hand these amendments are all minor, technical and non-controversial, but largely minor, technical and non-controversial only, largely.

64
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,740
所以，no case。

65
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,450
only yesterday。

66
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,670
After more than a month.

67
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,710
That's really.

68
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,600
What on earth are you doing?

69
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,000
Why did you keep adding on then?

70
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,870
哦，no charge。

71
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,820
Chance for a successful conviction.

72
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,870
但呢個高級法院修訂法令限額，修訂嘢。

73
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,610
Can I go back to what I just said? You're talking about this huge workload of the judiciary.

74
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:53,460
stemming from non-refouled claims has imposed great pressure on the workload of the judiciary.

75
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:19,150
With all those charges being thrown about around town, like the little daggers you can use.

76
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:23,130
Quite controversial, as you've heard, a number of my democratic colleagues have pointed out.

77
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:39,910
啊，no！the day before yesterday， I received by slow mail a letter from the Justice Department explaining why they wouldn't take to court somebody who threw at least 39 animals out a window。

78
00:10:47,160 --> 00:11:05,970
That the Justice Department letter gave me a line saying that in Chinese only, of course, but something to the effect of the overall evidence does do not present an enough.

79
00:07:50,590 --> 00:08:10,600
Now I read through our Legislative Council brief, as prepared by the Secretariat, very thoroughly. It's such a thorough and nicely worded and clearly precise and concise document. It says that the.

80
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:43,830
Now of course the secretariat of this council would put down the government line, saying the rapid surge in civil caseloads in recent years, particularly those initiated by way of judicial review (J.R.) for cases.

81
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,040
nou。

82
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,080
nou。

83
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,160
meshes。

84
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,000
full stop。

85
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,600
Honestly.

86
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,680
This is just incredible.

87
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,680
This the reform claims the controversy.

88
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:48,840
你 throw them this particular charge. It's such an absurd department you're operating.

89
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:05,330
或可以至少輕易成為一個難民來源，給其他國家。

90
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:29,570
because you think you can't win, there's no way of getting an absolute conviction easily. Then forget it.

91
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:40,170
但係，what about all those people who are being charged with rioting， and some of them weren't even there at the supposed riot scenes？

92
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:17,420
To come back to this non-refoulement claims, now refoulement is essentially the forcible return of refugees or asylum seekers to their country of origin or a place where.

93
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:37,430
They, they, they're very likely to be subjected to persecution and things. It's quite ironic actually, because if you've heard what Kenneth Lung had to say just now, he was slightly baffled that in the.

94
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,490
unsettle。

95
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,490
容海欣議員。

96
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,630
邵家遵議員要求點算法定人數？

97
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,390
judicial efficiency.

98
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,070
法定人數已夠，會議恢復。容海欣議員。

99
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,510
邵家臻議員，你乜嘢規程問題？請點算法定人數？

100
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,180
court procedures and promote efficiency.

101
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,130
prefer to sit back and think again. Thank you.

102
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:16,840
If the bar association doesn't give it its full support, I as layman would.

103
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,570
議性嘅技術性修訂，噉我就比較關注係有關高等法院條例第四章嘅修訂部分。

104
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:27,690
and the government, oh, they explain to the bar association and try to convince them that that they need to streamline.

105
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:08,020
或那會有指示，非常強的保留，於酒吧協會，和，它。

106
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:57,440
This savage times, well he didn't use this term, but he effectively said Hong Kong as a destination for asylum seekers or refugees is quite absurd because the tables have been turned. Hong Kong will

107
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:34,990
至少，我們秘書處提出在公開諮詢，那，哦，律師會和律師公會都已經被諮詢過，當然，如常，律師會香港當然沒有。

108
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:55,000
objections basically no indicated general support for the proposed amendments fine okay but then the bar association aha watch out the bar association apparently initially queried whether there could be other alternative

109
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:16,480
alternative measures that could alleviate the workload of the judiciary and whether the high standards of fairness would be affected by the proposed amendments. Of course, it's all about this asylum seeker business, right?

110
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:56,210
Now the conclusion is that the bar association thereafter indicated that it had no further comment. It didn't say the bar association endorses, agrees with this amendment. Now I don't know whether this is just legally.

111
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:23,360
主席，我先申報，我以大律師身份曾經參與過法庭案件啦，包括係免遣返申請嘅案件嘅。誒，今次我哋講嘅係二零一九年成文法執行規定條誒條例草案。咁條例草案主要係涉及四組嘅修訂建議啦。誒，其他咧都係比較一啲輕微啊，冇爭。

112
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:50,860
誒呢一個部分咧就係講第四章咧第三廿四B條，就係擴大使用兩名法官上訴法庭，使該法庭亦可以聆訊同埋裁定以下案件嘅分得兩種。第一咧就係針對由於少少於三名上訴法庭法官組成嘅上訴法庭所。

113
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,210
數字咧，政府都有畀我哋㗎。

114
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,800
八九啊七宗啦，未處理好嘅啦。

115
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,480
而確立嘅數字咧，就係二百三十一宗。

116
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,730
咁點解我哋頭先所講公義係咁緊要咧？嗱，我哋頭先我哋一路講啦，雖然

117
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:36,860
噉我想睇翻咧，其實最近點解我哋講個工作量大成一個去個咩一個目咩咩一個數字咧？

118
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:50,900
今次提出佢哋需要嘅修訂，希望可以從提高佢哋嘅效率，嚟令到上訴人係尋求到公義嘅。

119
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:33,270
我係我哋希望咧，其實想勾出呢二百三十一個人，去幫助呢二百三十一個人，去令到佢哋唔使翻翻佢哋嘅原居地，佢哋受一啲威脅嘅地方。

120
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:28,090
升啦，因為免返申請嘅司法複核案件為甚，對於司法機構嘅工作量，特別係由原眾法庭同埋上訴法庭組成嘅高等法院同埋終審院嘅工作量咧，帶嚟咗巨大嘅壓力。所以咧，佢哋就建議作出咗剛才我讀出嘅修訂啦。

121
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:15,350
確立呢啲嘅免遣返申請嘅個案咧，係實際係少嘅嗱。我睇翻數字咧，由二零零九年去到二零二零年，入境署審核總共嘅個案咧，即係呢啲免遣返申請嘅個咧，有二萬二千七百三十七宗。

122
00:26:50,860 --> 00:27:10,870
所作出嘅決定，而向中審法院提出誒許可申請，同埋二針對原眾法庭根據高等法院規則第四A章第五十三號命令第三括弧四條規則所作以下嘅決定而提出嘅上訴，同埋拒絕批予申請司法複核嘅許可嘅。

123
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:30,880
決定同埋批予呢啲嘅許可私家條件嘅決定，即係第六括弧一同埋六括弧二條。誒第二點咧都係緊要嘅，就係有關於誒如果係誒上訴法庭咧未能達至同一致嘅裁定咧，除咗上訴各方可以申請之外咧，上訴庭亦。

124
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:50,890
都可以主動作出命令，將有關嘅案件由誒唔係偶數而不少於三名嘅上訴法庭法官組成嘅上訴法庭，值前重新爭辯，即係第六號四同埋六號五條。噉啊，剛才唔同唔少嘅議員咧都關注到有關於效率同埋公義嘅平衡，我認。

125
00:27:50,890 --> 00:28:10,900
為咧，今次嘅修訂咧係提高咗效率，嚟讓嚟為一個目標咧，畀申請人同埋上訴人咧係尋求公義嘅。噉我哋留意到咧，點解我哋今次作出修訂啦？我見到政府畀我哋嘅誒解釋咧，就係話誒，因為近年咧民事案件係大量嘅上。

126
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:59,630
由二零一六年嘅二誒二二百二十八宗咧，即係喺高等法院原訟庭司法複核申請許可嘅申請咧，由二百二十八宗咧係飆升到去二零一九年嘅總數係三千八百八十九。咁誒，其中咧三千七百二十七宗咧就係免遣返申請。

127
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:19,640
而非免遣返申請咧，就有一百六十二宗。我哋見到個數字係懸殊嘅，即係免遣返申請咧有三千七七百幾，免誒非免遣返申請咧就一百六十幾。咁當然啦，其餘嘅有關於高等法院嘅上訴庭民事上訴啦，有五百誒。今年咧，二零一九年咧係有五。

128
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:42,090
誒繼續處理咗㗎啦，而免遣返申請咧入邊咧係包含咗係三百五十一宗終審庭嘅許可嘅申申請咧總數咧就有四百二十六宗，而免遣返申請包含量咧係三百八十八宗，係大部分咧都係免遣返申請嘅案件，所以我理解咧點解政府今。

129
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,220
所以我同意啦。

130
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,680
嘅時間，佢哋有個面見，有個screen interview。今日screening完之後咧，佢哋就會有一個決定。

131
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:24,020
嘅時候，如果由由去由呢一個點去到終審法院嘅時間咧，係可以好長嘅。

132
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,630
係佢哋原本嘅問題，我哋係希望用個效率，為個目標嚟幫到呢班人尋求公義。

133
00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:04,850
做咩都做唔到嘅時候，佢哋可以香港做啲咩咧？我亦都留意到，我哋二零二零年嘅預算畀佢哋嘅誒一啲製造咧，係差唔多去到七億元。

134
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:17,150
真係誒要司法複核，去到終審庭嘅時間咧，可以係以十年計嘅。因為而家我哋積壓個個案咧，你諗下啦，嗱，由高等法院原終法庭有三千八百幾單嘅案件係未處理。

135
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:22,950
一個一個咁大龐大嘅數字，即係我亦亦都理解。如果佢哋做唔到嘢，我哋梗係要養養佢啦，係咪先？我哋呢個係人道問題啊嘛。咁但係又要理解，有一部分人當然係，如果佢哋又冇工做，但係經濟上又有困難嘅時候，佢哋。

136
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:53,690
噉我亦都理解咧，而家呢啲嘅免翻申請嘅人士咧，如果留喺香港，佢哋嘅難處係乜嘢？呢啲我理解嘅，因為我過往差唔多差唔多十年啦，接近十年嘅時間，七八年嘅時間，都係有處理過佢哋嘅案件。噉你你話如果佢哋喺香港根本係唔能夠公？

137
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:43,240
都可能係逼住去犯法啦、搶劫啦、強姦人啊噉樣，好多呢噉嘅案件誒，迎運而生噉樣。噉我哋理解佢哋香港嘅問題，亦都理解佢哋嘅難處。咁點解我哋要提高效率咧？就正正係幫佢哋點樣去人道去處理呢一啲香港嘅問題。

138
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:14,480
主席，其實過往幾年咧，我見到入境處同埋保安局咧喺呢方面咧做咗唔少工作，包括係可以縮短佢哋嘅申請時間啦，誒完善曬誒成個流程啦，令到佢哋係滯留喺香港時間咧係短啲嘅。噉我或者好多市民都唔理解佢哋究竟有啲咩程序？

139
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:34,490
誒入誒有啲咩時間嘅程序誒點樣申請啊噉樣噉我哋譬如接落去到佢哋個誒申請表，噉佢哋有二十八日咧，佢哋可以填填呢張填呢張表格，填完之後咧，佢哋要交翻入警署啦，交去入警署之後咧，咁誒入警署可能要誒有時間睇，跟住咧就可能畀。

140
00:32:40,970 --> 00:33:00,980
即係過咗一段時間咧，有個決定係入境處畀佢哋決定，話佢哋究竟個申請個結果係點樣？咁如果係誒唔話唔可以誒係唔唔唔得嘅，唔可以留喺香港嘅，即係唔唔確立嘅申一一個申請咧，噉佢哋咧就會有十四日嘅時間就作出上訴啦。噉啊，當然咧。

141
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:20,990
咁呢個上訴咧就冇一啲公堂嘅支持嘅，即係之前之前嗰啲時間咧就係有有一啲誒，如果佢哋利用一啲政府嘅律師去幫佢哋填填表啊，或者畀一啲法律意見咧，係又係有公堂嘅律師可以幫手嘅。但係上呢一幫方面嘅上訴咧就未必又冇冇㗎啦，佢哋要自己去。

142
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:41,000
去尋求一啲法律意見，或者係自行上訴。如果上訴係確立嘅，即係覺得佢哋誒係係應該可以係係留喺香港嘅，咁嗰度就完咗啦。噉佢哋繼續留喺香港噉嘅情況。但係如果佢哋係不確立嘅咧，噉佢哋可以繼續去第二個第去翻。

143
00:33:41,000 --> 00:34:01,010
另外個法律程序可以去一個judicial review，即係司法複核嘅程序。咁嗰度咧又會可以利用到我哋公堂咧，去幫助佢哋去支持去去誒點樣作出一啲上訴嘅申請。咁所以點解成個過程咧，即係由一個一個申請人填一張表格，去到如果佢。

144
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,180
覺得咧培訓人手嗰方面咧係需要去正視。

145
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,510
噉我認為咧，呢一個亦都可以提升到處理案件嘅整體效率。

146
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,780
主席，我哋頭先亦都有唔少人咧，係關注到。

147
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:36,290
係咪司法機構人手短缺嘅問題，令到我哋有所積壓，令到我哋處理唔到咧？

148
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:16,820
程序其實呢啲亦都唔係任何任何嘅新鮮事。我哋而家我哋法庭都有唔少個案咧，係可以用一啲書面嘅程序咧去處理嘅。

149
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:09,690
我哋點樣去令到誒長遠嚟講減少輪候時間啦？我自己自己都有一個親身經歷嘅，其實我。

150
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:43,580
答覆嘅話，噉佢哋自己對個司法嘅體制會點樣睇咧？即係佢哋都會覺得有懷疑，係唔係係唔係香港法庭特登去留難佢，或者佢需要一個公義嘅時候，佢需要個答覆嘅時候，佢攞唔到咧？

151
00:37:45,320 --> 00:38:01,140
嗰下我之前咧都響誒參觀過誒澳洲嘅最高法院，咁咪留意到當地一啲嘅誒科技法庭，噉我都覺得當地嘅科技法庭咧幾值得我哋香港嘅詐價藉藉鑑。

152
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:43,610
多啲嘅司法人員，一啲司誒法官，令到佢哋可以留任留喺一個司法機構入邊，亦都令到更多嘅誒法律嘅畢業生啦，亦都喺呢一方面咧係多啲嘅誒一個一個抱負啦，希望可以對香港有抱負，可以進入去司法界去為香港人服務。

153
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:44,400
所以我哋點解要講效率？點解要提高效率？我哋並唔係喺度講係應該尋求公義，定係要取捨於效率之間咧。我哋並唔係噉樣講，我哋係希望提高個效率，希望呢一啲嘅案件可以盡快處理，盡快幫到應該要受受呢個幫助嘅人。

154
00:34:47,800 --> 00:35:07,810
今次嘅修訂啦，就算係用兩名嘅法官、兩名嘅上訴法官，同埋佢哋可以係用一啲書面嘅情況咧，去作出一啲處理個案嘅權力啦。我認為咧，呢個亦都係公正同埋可以迅速噉樣，又合乎經濟效益嘅情況下處理一啲法庭。

155
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:57,190
我其實我認同嘅，我認同我哋而家司法人手係短缺，因為我哋越嚟越多呢啲誒有唔同嘅案件，無論刑事好、民事好、婚姻嘅訴訟好，誒呢啲誒難民啊，或者係顯顯顯化申請嘅個案咧，雖然係越嚟越少，但係我哋都要處理積壓。咁但係我覺得。

156
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:30,050
即係見到啦，有啲嘅民事案件咧，兩年幾三年咧都未有一個判決出嚟，即係審完案兩年都未有個一個結果出嚟。其實呢一個正正就係公義嘅問題啦。咁如果你話申請人同埋同埋誒上訴人，如果佢哋咁耐嘅時間都攞唔到一個，但

157
00:36:44,500 --> 00:37:04,510
咁所以，我希望咧喺減少案件嘅輪候時間呢方面咧，輪候時間啦，同埋誒個個裁決個結果獲得個結果嘅時間咧，係需要拿捏好。噉我相信咧，而家誒法官嘅誒即係日日嘅工作量咧係非常之大嘅。你諗下一日。

158
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,900
主席本人更資深啲。

159
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,930
我反對今次嘅修訂。

160
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,980
可以去減省我哋法庭嘅時間。

161
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,410
喺呢方面咧，誒，提高我哋司法界嘅。

162
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,500
係好早嘅時間咧，就係已經誒。

163
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:37,010
我哋效率去為我哋嘅申請人、上訴人尋求到公義，我係支持今次嘅修訂。

164
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:31,350
相反，佢係以輕微同埋技術性修訂呢啲理由咧，會係帶嚟咧好重大同埋具爭議嘅結果。

165
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:41,810
嘅誒審審案嘅情況㗎啦，噉我希望咧呢個可以誒為我哋律師啦，為我哋嘅法官啦多啲畀培訓啦，誒令到我哋多啲人去利用一啲新嘅方法。

166
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:22,690
綜合嘅條例草案只在對多項條例，包括高等法院條例第四章及適宜及通則條例第一章提出輕微技術性同埋冇爭議嘅雜項修訂。

167
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:51,630
正如好多議員同事講咗啦，當中最具最具爭議嘅地方咧，就係佢建議修訂咧高等法院條例中上訴庭處理部分司法複核許可程序，可可以由一般三名嘅法官處理嘅程序，改為兩名法官就可以處理啦。

168
00:38:45,780 --> 00:39:05,250
通知大家誒法庭誒唔開啦噉樣，咁呢個唔我唔係想講話係對法對律師啊或者對其他嘅咩影響，但係我覺得正正就係我哋要利用呢一個機會，令利用呢一次嘅經驗咧，去反省我哋嘅誒科技上可以點樣幫到我哋提高我哋嘅司法效率。

169
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:24,730
全日已經要審案，誒夜晚就要睇文件，跟住仲要寫裁決書，跟住仲可能要處理啲上訴嘅案件，或者啲審核嘅案件。其實法官嘅工作量係非常之大，所以我認為咧係應該要正視，同埋應該要去留意翻我哋點樣去聘請多。

170
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:22,150
咁嗰度誒當然啦，律師桌上面有曬啲視頻啊、電腦接駁位啊，誒技術水平咧都好高啦，亦都有誒被告人嘅一個視像嘅，即係有一啲可能響誒第二個省嘅被告人未必可以去到法院入邊聽審或者去誒見個法官，但係佢哋可以透過視

171
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:42,160
樣咧可以可能喺誒拘留中心啦，喺獄中啦，都可以直接可以上到庭。咁其實呢個亦都係大大減省咗我哋嘅時間。咁誒誒，主席你都睇到我哋今今年嘅疫情咧，其實對全世界都好大影響，對我哋香港都好大影響嘅。我哋司法界，我哋嘅法誒司法機構咧，亦都係。

172
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:28,670
我希望咧司法機構咧更加去引進多一啲嘅資訊嘅科技同埋電子化啦，與時並進啦，減少用紙同埋誒達到去環保呢方面嘅諗法，亦都可以精簡一啲法律程序，縮短審理案件嘅時間。我留意到而家都唔少人係利用緊一啲無。

173
00:39:46,290 --> 00:40:06,300
不過咧，想提醒政府咧，用電子模式進行法院事務咧係一個新措施，咁啲新安排，所以咧喺呢方面咧有有一啲變動啊，司法機構作出嘅行性指示啊等等，日後咧好可能咧因為運作經驗未夠咧，所以就可能越嚟越慢。噉我希望咧政，

174
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:29,700
培訓啦，對我哋司法人員提供足夠嘅在職培訓啦，電腦軟件咧，亦都係要誒相應配合好啊。因為我諗都係最近呢幾年咧，先換咗啲Windows九啊五嘅電腦，咁都希望司法界咧可以喺呢方面誒提進一步啦。咁誒希望可以將我哋提升。

175
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,920
邵家遵二。

176
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,680
宗教啦，種族嘅啲迫害。

177
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,750
時間而免訟申請咧，被政府用嚟過橋咧，已經唔單止一次㗎啦。

178
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:57,130
著大批嘅申請人咧，不獲得批准呢一個免犯申請，先會訴諸於司法覆核。

179
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:28,730
而且咧，各國都有一啲有豐富申請官司經驗嘅人權律師批評咧，由政府全資資助嘅當值律師服務咧，嗰個質素好參差。

180
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:57,090
亦都有，亦都有人問咧，就係而家處理免免返申請嘅私有福額嘅數量咧，其實已經過咗高峯咯。而家先修定，係咪啱時間咧？定係以呢個過為過橋咧？

181
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:39,450
係因為咧過往咧入境處處理免返申請咧係有問題啊嘛，先會令到咧好多免返申請咧係被拒，佢哋先需要咧係透過司法複核咧嚟去解決自己嘅問題。

182
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:25,730
係有助處理案件，包括涉及免遣返申請嘅司法複核，並使到司法機構可以更加靈活地調配人手處理其他法庭嘅案件。

183
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:11,160
政府嘅答覆咧就係話，法庭咧係無法控制入品案件嘅數宗數嘅，包括嚟申請司法覆核嘅許可，但係咧應該對於舒緩法庭整體嘅工作量咧有正面影響嘅。

184
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:25,810
我咧就真係覺得咧，今次咧政府咧係以免遣返申請咧嚟過橋，免遣返申請之所以咧係申請司法覆核咧，係因為佢哋咧嘅免遣返申請咧係被拒。

185
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:43,740
過往咧已經有議員咧質疑過修訂之後咧可以縮短到幾多多少處理案件嘅時間咧？究竟可以縮短幾多咧？係咪真係好似用議員所講話，由十年可以變為變得好，變為幾個月，變為一年半載？

186
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:17,390
入境處嘅職員咧，就唔準唔準許咧申請人咧嘅律師為佢解釋咧被逼去嘅經歷。喺超過幾小時嘅面試期間咧，申請人咧亦都唔能夠同律師商量，變相令到咧申請人嘅法律權利同埋人權咧受到損害。

187
00:40:48,510 --> 00:41:08,520
首先咧，我必須要指出咧，今次二零一九年成文法雜項規定條例草案咧，並非如二零二零年六月十九號發表嘅《二零一九成文法雜項規定條例草案》委員會報告第二段所指，條例草案係一項充。

188
00:41:51,930 --> 00:42:11,940
政府嘅解釋咧，就係話近年咧民事案件嘅數量大幅上升，尤其係免遣犯申請嘅司法複核嘅數量咧增加得最明顯，令到由原眾法庭同埋上訴庭組成嘅高等法院同埋終審法院嘅工作量咧大增，所以咧政府認為咧呢次修訂咧。

189
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:59,740
我哋一定要找緊嗰個問題嘅核心，免返申請嘅個案積聚嘅問題嘅源頭究竟係邊度？例如咧，過往咧有嚟自非洲嘅申請人咧，由2005年咧就逃亡到嚟香港，滯留喺香港超過十年，出席超過十幾次嘅誒審批面試，但

190
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:49,110
導致到咧，許許多嘅申請人咧係被不確認為咧難民，以及咧傳譯員嘅外語能力咧都唔好，亦都令到咧申請人咧面對法律援助不足嘅同時咧，亦都有不公平嘅對待。因此咧，免返申請嘅審批過程繁複同埋緩慢，以至於程序不公到。

191
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,070
正因為咧，免返申請嘅個案咧係少過百分之一。

192
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,700
更加影響到咧所有司法複核案件嘅程序公義。

193
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:42,560
因為咧喺過往咧喺研誒有研究指示咧。

194
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,980
即係又唔審，第一個唔審訊，第二個又唔審訊，兩輪嘅唔審訊。

195
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,160
申請不審慎，在面對法庭處理申請人嘅司法覆核嘅申請唔審慎。

196
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:10,690
當然咧，實際情況，香港人喺過去嗰一年咧，好明白號型同香港人嘅距離，究竟有幾咁近。

197
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:25,500
嘅手法同埋質素出現咗問題，先會令到咧，先會導致到咧司法複核嘅個案咧係增加啫。

198
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:50,820
成功率嘅低咧，令到咧好多申請者咧就由喺香港或者喺居留喺青山灣入境中心嘅時間越嚟越長。

199
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:20,630
而且咧退出公約咧，連監察警權同埋獄政嘅人權關人權法嘅框架咧，亦都受到咧損害。

200
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:36,610
政府唔去處理呢啲源頭，反而咧係借申請問題去處理所有司法複核嘅個案，去影響所有為爭取各項應有法律觀念嘅人士。

201
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:33,040
所以今次咧，政府又以免犯申請為理由咧，去修改高等法院條例，最終影響嘅恐怕咧，唔單止係影響到免犯申請嘅司法複核程序。

202
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:37,220
喺面對今次修訂高等法院條例之後咧，司法複核嘅程序被加快，申請人嘅法律保障同埋支援咧，究竟係就更大嘅保障啦，定係更容易受傷害咧？

203
00:45:47,030 --> 00:46:02,520
過往咧，政府要退出聯合國嘅禁止酷刑公約，表面上咧係為咗減少申請人嚟香港，但實際上咧，實際上係點樣咧？就係欠缺咗禁止酷刑公約上去保障港人免受酷刑對待。

204
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:56,980
有法律界嘅代表咧，就認為咧，因為過往咧由三名法官審理司法複核嘅個案，如果繼續維持嘅話，可以確保咧司法複核咧得到一審慎處理。司法複核需要審慎，正係因為過往有處理免犯申請嘅法律。

205
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:18,010
如果咧申請人咧唔受資資格複核咧，佢哋就可能面面臨咧係要遣返翻自己國家。原本咧佢哋係想透過咧免遣返申請咧係嚟到香港，再去到咧一個接收難民嘅國家，但係佢哋咧就要因為咧免遣返申請嘅失敗咧而再次面對咧原有嘅國家嘅政治啦。

206
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:41,040
免費申請嘅司法複核嘅個案過多，即使咧申請人咧申請司法複核，但係超過九成嘅申請者咧又要面對司法複核時咧被拒絕嘅法律援助，變相令到一個案咧係更加更加複雜，增加咗法庭處理嘅個案嘅程序同埋。

207
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:17,270
嘅司法咧嘅複核個案係申請人嘅國籍資料喺審批時出錯，變相令到申請人咧申請人咧係不獲得批准，所以唔係免返申請被濫用而導致咧申請個案增加，而係特區政府喺處理申請個案。

208
00:47:51,310 --> 00:48:11,320
如果今次修訂高等法院條例之後咧，令到法令到司法複核個案嘅速度咧係雖然加快咗，但係更多司法複核嘅申請咧就唔獲得批准，將會令到更多申請人咧就面對雙重嘅受害，先面對入境處處理申請人嘅申。

209
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,040
所以。

210
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,000
釋放嘅決定。

211
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,490
而更加重要嘅係。

212
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,050
今次咧修訂高等法院條例嘅修訂咧。

213
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:25,340
而喺申請司法覆核嘅時候咧，又得唔到足夠嘅法律支援。

214
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:36,880
我重申，我係反對二零一九成文法雜項規定嘅條例草案嘅修訂。

215
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:44,200
而家咧，青山灣入境中心嘅絕食人士咧，已經已經絕食咗超過一百日。哇！一百日。

216
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:53,900
當中有唔少人咧係申請人士，佢哋喺喺CIC面對不公平嘅對待嘅問題，仍然咧係未獲得有效嘅答解決。

217
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:35,310
所以喺今次咧去修訂高等法院條例之後咧，申請人咧喺司法複核嘅程序加快嘅情況下邊咧，申請人過往面對嘅問題。

218
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:28,220
不足嘅問題，更加要面對青山灣入境處嘅不人道嘅對待嘅問題。政府係應該以改善處理申請人嘅面遣返申請嘅機制，而唔係本末倒置噉樣樣去處理呢個問題。

219
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:35,940
會否令到喺啲喺青山灣入境中心裏邊嘅申請人咧，係更加難透過司法覆核而獲判免返申請，同埋安排到誒接收難民嘅國家咧，就實在係好值得我哋去關注。

220
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:51,170
如何如何？例如話，如何點樣唔獲得誒當值律師代表上庭啊？或者連傳譯員都冇呢種情況咧？係咪真係得到相應嘅改善咧？都係申請人咧喺司法覆核下邊咧，法律權利係咪受到保障嘅一個關鍵嘅考慮？

221
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:19,600
成嘅申請人咧，係因為出現咗情緒同埋身體問題咧而缺席會議。當佢哋咧要面對精神同埋身體壓力嘅同時，當呢個免免遣返申請又唔再獲得批准，佢哋就要透過咧司法覆核咧去處理申請。

222
00:48:42,840 --> 00:49:02,850
近七成嘅申請人咧，喺遞交申請表格之後咧，要等待咧超過三個月嘅時間先能夠安排咧審核會面，而審批程序咧又因為各種突發嘅情況咧，越拖越長，達到百分之三十三嘅個案咧，因為各種原因咧需要改期，有近七成係七。

223
00:49:53,770 --> 00:50:13,780
近呢十年咧，青山灣入境中心咧嘅拘留人士咧有免返有免遣返申請嘅人士，同時亦都有咧申請司法複核嘅申請人。佢哋喺青青山灣入境中心嘅扣押嘅係咪合係咪合法而向法庭咧申請複核咧，就多次被法庭否決。

224
00:50:54,180 --> 00:51:14,190
而今次咧修定呢個高等法院條例嘅嘅修訂咧，政府聲稱咧係要處理積壓免遣返申請嘅司法複核個案，但係申請人面對嘅唔單止係入境處嘅審批不審慎嘅問題，同時面對嘅係司法審核誒司法複核資。

225
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,090
代主席。

226
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,410
點解啊？

227
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,780
咁其實，

228
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,110
郭榮亨議員。

229
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,720
本人僅此陳詞。

230
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,280
呢個咪正正。

231
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,030
法庭如何處理案件？

232
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,740
點解係由我哋立法會去討論？

233
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,660
去討論呢一個草案嘅同時間。

234
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,420
法定人數已夠，會議恢復。郭榮亨言。

235
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,740
我哋亦都要講一講一啲基本嘅憲制原則。

236
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,320
呢個條例正正就係顯示咗香港憲制係行三權分立。

237
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,370
等等，許志峯議員，你係規程問題？要求點算法定人數？許志峯議員要求點算法定人數？

238
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:56,130
點解咁講啊？因為早排行政長官包括一眾嘅建制派議員跳出嚟講話，香港係冇三權分立嘅。

239
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,310
而家法庭審案。

240
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,090
高等法院條例直接改。

241
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,070
去決定如何處理案件啊嘛！

242
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,810
嘅法例第四章嘅條款。

243
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:05,690
以後呢啲面遣返申請，全部唔準聽。

244
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:13,340
係要根據香港嘅法例，高等法院。

245
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:32,230
坐喺度嘅黃專員或者佢嘅上司律政司司長發一個指令，話第時呢個。

246
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:42,230
發個行政指令直接改，好似緊急法噉樣直接改，唔需要經過立法會去討論嘅。

247
01:02:54,010 --> 01:03:01,360
或者再極端啲啦，行政長官同馬道立司法機關講：以後唔準聽呢啲案。

248
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:13,810
全部駁回，唔使聽，咁唔使修改法例啦。使乜修改法例？如果香港係冇三權分立，學你哋依班人話齋嘅。

249
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:11,220
咁咧，今日我哋要討論嘅係依一個二零一九年成文法嘅集項規定修條例草案。

250
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:32,810
因為我哋要了解點解我哋立法會今日要討論同法庭有關嘅呢個高等法院條例第四章嘅修訂咧？

251
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:06,050
冇separation of powers呢條條例，主席，我想講，正正就係證明咗香港係要行三權分立。點解我咁講啊？

252
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:52,360
跟住改完之後咧，直接同司法機關講：嗱，你第時咧就噉樣去啊審理處理呢啲案件就得㗎啦。呢個咪冇三權分立咯。

253
01:03:52,640 --> 01:04:03,270
我哋而家喺度討論呢一個男子草案，正正就係體現咗司法機關佢去審理案件係要從呢一個獨立。

254
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:25,660
使乜修改呢個咩成文法啊？咪直接畀指示司法機關又好咯。使乜嚟到呢度立法會去修改而家呢一個法例啊？如果香港係冇三權分立嘅？

255
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:35,200
如果香港冇三權分立嘅，使乜我哋喺度大鑼大鼓噉樣去講話點樣修改條例啫？政府行政長官一個人話同司法機構講嗱，第時審呢啲案件啊！

256
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:53,730
一個法官得㗎啦，唔使三個或者極其量兩個啦。噉啊，行政長官同司法機關講咁咪得咯。噉啊，馬道立話哦，得啦，收到指示。O K，第時所有法院呢啲噉樣嘅誒免遣返申請，我哋啦啲法官咧就係一個審得㗎啦，冇得上訴。

257
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:41,390
咁點解當年梁美芬之流嘅係可以講話香港係有三權分立？

258
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:05,620
正正就係律政司司長加一眾嘅建制派嘅議員話冇三權分立啊嘛，嗱，如果佢哋係啱嘅。

259
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:57,430
《雜項規定草案》嘅內容點解我而家要講一啲咁基本嘅憲制原則，例如三權分立啊？正正就係因為呢個政府。

260
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:34,980
相互制衡嘅功能有一個憲制制度，呢個係梁美芬當年講，噉我就唔好明。可能我年紀細啦，二零零六年嗰陣我仲僆仔。

261
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:58,840
好啦，到fast forward十四年之後，到香港嘅二零二零年，點解香港突然間冇咗三權分立啊？點解民建聯嘅一班咩所謂周浩鼎啊、郭佩凡啊，可以指指點點向法官話你判錯案啊？唔係咁判嘅。

262
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:24,220
簡單嘅point，但係好可惜，坐喺度在座嘅，二零零六年十一月二十八號，香港專業及資深人員協會嘅發表嘅一個意見書，裏邊有梁美芬議員嘅意見，佢話香港係行三權分立。

263
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:26,450
去解釋香港嘅法律，同埋捍衞一啲基本嘅人權。唔論到行政機關，唔論到坐喺度嘅任何議員喺度指指點點，因為司法機關係獨立行行行事啊嘛。而立法會，我哋行使我哋嘅立法職能，亦都係。

264
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:47,130
獨立噉樣去行使我哋嘅立法嘅權利。高榮，我而家請你翻翻你條。我我而家講緊呢條點解？我而家講緊呢條男子操。我哋有邊一方面唔明啊？主持人基礎咧，我認為大家誒未必有同一個理解。不過咧，你可以已經説明咗你嘅諗法啦。我未説明我。I'm just getting warmed up。

265
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:26,000
主持佢哋係啱嘅，香港冇三權分立，噉我唔覺得需要討論呢一個男子草案喎，係咪啊？如果冇三權分立嘅，我哋使乜喺度講話話法官你第時咧處理呢案件咧就要兩個人、三個人，噉你咪直接啊黃專員叫啊特首發個指令畀司法機關通過咪搞掂咯？使乜我哋立法會喺度大羅？

266
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:46,010
大股啫，點解我要咁講啊？主席，點解我要講翻啲基本嘅邏輯咧？就係因為而家香港連最基本嘅邏輯，連最基本嘅原則都係可以唔講嘅，置之不理嘅。噉我哋講呢一個法例嚟做乜啊？梁美芬，二零零六年而家唔係三權分立嘅辯論。請你翻翻。而家主席，你你你你有邊一句唔明咧？

267
01:05:46,010 --> 01:06:06,020
我而家講緊就係話，如果香港係冇三權分立啊，我哋討論嚟呢一個男子騷案有乜嘢原因啊，係唔需要討論㗎。因為如果香港係冇三權分立嘅話，我哋唔需要去通過呢條法案。點解我哋今日要去通過呢條法案？就係因為正正顯示咗香港有三權分立啊嘛。呢個係一個好。

268
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:19,600
冇三權分立㗎，郭榮亨議員，我認為你已經離題啦，你已經用我認為我冇離題喎。請你翻翻去一九九四年立法項規定條例草案嘅修正內容。主席啊，你有邊句你聽唔明？你認為我係離題嘅？請你指出，即係點解咧？我已經好清楚向你提，我亦都好清。

269
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,120
係先啦。

270
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:32,860
係啊，已經。

271
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,040
請你停止發言。

272
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,780
因為我講極，你都唔會明。

273
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,520
郭榮亨議員，請你停止發言啦。

274
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:02,860
好啦，誒，康俊宇議員。

275
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,360
佢嘅行使，佢嘅司法嘅權利。

276
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:26,360
誒法定人數已夠，康俊宇議員請你繼續。

277
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:12,960
係梁繼昌議員，你咩規定？法定人數啊，唔夠主席。梁繼昌議員要求點算法定人數？

278
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:27,500
幾宗你都唔明點解三權分立係同呢一個男子草案係有直接關係嘅話，算。

279
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:40,880
我講極你都唔會明，因為點解啫？因為點解啫？如果你唔進入咧，噉我請你停止。建制派嘅議員，你唔需要胡依華還。請你停止發言啦，郭榮興議員。請你停止發言啦。

280
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:39,610
錯噉樣解釋緊，而家呢條條例，如果香港係冇司法獨立、冇三權分立嘅話，我哋唔需要討論啦，主席。我就係唔明呢一個點，你可唔可以揾啲官員或者揾啲建制派嘅同事解釋畀我聽？郭榮亨議員，你作為法律界嘅議員，你好清楚，你要表達你對憲制嗰個睇法。

281
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:59,620
法我亦都酌情容許你做，但係咧已經去到五分幾鐘啦。你亦都好清楚，而家我哋就住。如果如果你可以，我希望你唔好再打斷我。你好清楚呢一個呢一個條例草案牽涉到司法界係點樣運作，牽涉到我哋如何去解釋呢一個。

282
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:19,630
高等法院嘅條例牽涉到呢一個司法機關是否能夠獨立噉樣去運作，決定如何處理案件。點解我要提出三權分立啊？主席，因為就係阿黃專賢嘅老闆律政司司長，等一等，佢講話係冇三權分立啊嘛，梁美芬議員。

283
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:39,640
你咩規程問題？我希望你誒執行議事規則。你剛才已經講咗咧，就係郭榮亨議員咧係離題。我當然好歡迎郭榮亨議員咧，再詳細睇我喺二零零七年同埋二零一五年嘅中英文書基本法。梁美芬議員，你指出嘅規程問題，我都請郭議員，係。

284
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:59,650
留意嗱，郭榮亨議員，我再次提醒你，如果你再次離題嘅話咧，噉我咧係必須要咧係執行議事規則，咁請你咧翻翻去係二零一九年成文法雜項規定條例草案嘅實質修訂內容。呢個亦都係我哋早前對每位發言議員要求。

285
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:19,660
嗰個討論內容嚇，請你繼續。嗱，主席唔使咁緊張嘅，即係我知道喺呢一個議事廳，我再去講香港係有三權分立咧，喺好多人嘅耳仔當中咧係好唔舒服嘅，因為已經落咗聖旨啦嘛，香港冇三權分立㗎嘛，咁嗰啲人話要跟咯，阿梁美芬嗰啲咪要根基咯，阿

286
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:39,670
律政司司長嗰啲咪要作為法律界嘅代表，作為法律界嘅應該係守護法治嘅人。如果你係繼續嘅話，我唯有請你發請你停止發言啦，主席啊！主席好簡單嘅，你叫律政司司長嘅代表到時會驚嚇。究竟香港係咪有三權分立噉啊？得啦，啊，議論過榮，而你亦都好。

287
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:59,680
清楚，今日嘅題目唔係辯論三權分立。我已多次強調，今日嘅題目係牽涉三權分立啊，嘛，主席。主席，今次嘅呢一個條例草案係牽涉到香港嘅呢一個高等法院是否需要按呢一個司法獨立原則運作啊？嘛，如果你直接進入去當中嘅。

288
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:19,690
嘅實質修訂咧，我就請你停止發言啦。Sorry啊，呢個我哋未進入呢一個CSA階段，我唔係第一做議員，唔需要你教。而家我哋講緊二讀，就住整條條例喺原則上，我哋係咪需要支持或者反對？嗱，我唔同你辯論啊，講咗七分幾鐘，如果講咗七分。

289
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,090
三權分立。

290
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,090
阿李慧瓊。

291
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,020
我冇。

292
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:47,130
郭榮亨議員，你好清楚，我已經係多次提醒咗你。

293
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:41,500
又跟咗去林鄭月娥翻深圳，喂大佬，即咁都得嘅。

294
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,780
但係最大問題係今日本身應該要坐喺度嘅律政司鄭玉華又死咗去邊咧？

295
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:39,360
已經到抗進議員啦，因為你已經多次提醒咗你，你冇直接進入相關嘅辯論。

296
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:55,560
我嘅裁決咧，亦都係最後嘅裁決啦。請你咧係尊重我裁決。阿擴進議員，請你發言。

297
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:48,430
施政報告夠膽死啊！後一個月全港等緊你，林鄭月娥回水至少一萬蚊，你走咗去。

298
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:17,190
影響全數嗰個嘅司法複核嘅申請，講緊嘅係涉及嗰個嘅複核嘅門檻同埋個程序嘅公平性，一定要審慎考慮。

299
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:30,480
噉就當當解決嗰件事㗎啦。今日咧，我想同大家講，要處理呢一個《城文法暫行規定》嘅條例草案，本身呢個技術性嘅修訂咧，真係冇乜爭議。

300
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:27,710
李慧瓊，我老實講，阿梁君燕都唔好咁主持啊，大佬咁當然先講講啲今日呢個條例呢個嘅草案咁頭先同事展述咗啦，噉啊建制派唔好而人民你一係撳掣，每人講十五分鐘，OK，好快過一日嘅啫。

301
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:19,410
即係由你代主席第一個會，就喺我哋嘅同事發言期間，就暫停佢嘅發言。即係你都樹立一個非常之即係特別嘅榜樣。嗱，老實講，我本身咧呢十零分鐘發言啊，唔諗住招呼你嘅。OK，咁當然我都唔挑戰你啦。陣間又熄我麥，你最叻就熄人麥。

302
01:12:48,820 --> 01:13:08,830
林鄭月娥就話要見習近平，噉你鄭月華有咩事咧？喂，大佬真係真係火都嚟埋噉啊！本身冇嘢，又見阿郭榮亨講緊三權分立講到咁興起，咁無啦無啦，立法會唔覺得三權分立啊？真係都幾好笑啊！呢個我覺得，喂阿主席，你呢個裁決真係要名留青史㗎。喺立法會議事堂不能講。

303
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:48,110
唔可以，人民坐喺個位度。唉，主席嗱，呢個備政司司長乜都唔做，幾廿只動物畀人掟落街，又唔跟十二港人嘅法律權益又喺俘虜冷你。今日講呢個條例草案又唔坐定定喺度。喂，大佬呢個條例草案講緊係佢好緊張嘅。講到就話啦，要建議修訂呢個高等法院條例嘅第四章。

304
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,050
喺優劣同埋原則咧，係進行辯論。

305
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:20,500
個個睇到睇睇在眼內，就係我哋香港何其不幸，有一個噉嘅律政司司長。

306
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:42,910
記得佢咧個文望叫做戰師弟，三個師長裏邊文望最低，就鄭玉華。

307
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:49,560
越南啊，都係排第二啫，排第一係邊個？排第一係中國內地啊！喂，大佬，哎呀，真係唔該曬，聰明住頂，周浩頂，問啱問題冇得頂，呢個咧真係犀利，因為佢真係問啱咗條問題，咦？

308
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:21,650
噉啊陰公啲嘅，我唔我唔爭啊林鄭月娥啊大佬，畀我下火都嚟埋。噉啊，主席，我又講翻個題目。主席辯論今日二零一九年成文法雜項規定嘅條例草案，就要辯論呢個條例個修訂本身嘅合理性。

309
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:59,040
主席定啲嚟，我梗係知道講二零一九年成文法集案規定嘅條例草案啦。喺二讀階段評定佢嘅本身嘅優劣嘅時候，第一件事要招呼就本身要坐喺度嘅律政司聽我哋噏噏完一輪之後可以解㗎嘛，大佬。

310
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:14,820
或者你噉樣去講，係咪可以治到嗰個問題嘅本身，定係治標不治本咧？我話治標不治本啦，好老實講。喂，即係有啲嘢，即係講到明啊，嘥氣啦，大佬正經嘢你又唔做，動物虐殺我又唔跟，日日嘥時間搞埋啲無理上訴，搞啲細路哥。

311
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:38,860
唔知跟唔跟車好？喂，大佬，呢一次嘅修訂，你修訂嘅上嚟講到好好好聽啦，要加快程序啊，話嗰啲嘅學型申請嘅數字啊，話好嚴重啊，有嗰個嘅啊原狀法庭、訴訟法庭啊，咁嗰個壓力好大。我但係唔信你啊嘛～

312
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:36,630
其是啊，周浩鼎都不為餘力。二零一七年三月，質詢政府難民嘅遣返數字，原來二零一六年至一七年咧，入境處遣返咧，先後有五千九百三十二名人士返回其原居地。入境處就好認真回應啊，回應今日我哋呢個問題啦，就係話啦，呢張排行榜啊。

313
01:17:49,840 --> 01:18:07,760
一路講嗰個難民問題最嚴重係邊度啊？咁多咁多嘅同事，竟然係中國內地邊個問㗎？一定係班民主派問啊！唔係啊，問阿曾浩鼎問㗎，唔好意思啊噉。咁所以咧都難怪阿曾玉成近排講透露翻阿林鄭月娥話真係搖頭嘆息，點解民建聯咁多年都冇能夠培育政治人才？

314
01:13:48,110 --> 01:14:08,120
將上訴部分嘅司法許可程序由一般嘅三名法官減至兩名法官就可以處理嗰個程序。喂，加快嗰個嘅處理程序本身冇乜人反對嘅，老實講，即係快啲啊嘛，唔係咩好事嚟嘅咩噉。但係問題係，連個大律師公會都保留呢次，即係有保留就話啦，呢個修訂咧係會影。

315
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:37,480
咁但係好好笑啊！點解咁一個咁簡單講加快處理程序嘅一個修訂都會甩碌引嚟爭議咧？咪又係政呢個律政司司長咯？喂，佢樹立緊一個咩榜樣啊，大佬嗱？呢個老實講，除咗我呢邊民主派之外，部分建制派都可能會同意，因為《東方日報》猛烈炮轟咁多年，日子有功，大家都記。

316
01:14:43,200 --> 01:15:03,210
佢作為捍衞法治嘅第一人，你應要樹立一個榜樣，或者畀我哋公眾社會香港人對司法制度一個極大嘅信心。至少你做呢類修訂嘅時間，即係唔會有啲有腦啊問清問楚啦，噉樣明明哦要加快程序噉樣有乜有乜問題咧？噉樣係啊，本身加快程序冇問題㗎。你舊年搞個。

317
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:23,220
逃犯條例修定夠冇問題啦，本身講出嚟好好聽㗎。哇！要引導嗰條友咧，就過翻去台灣噉，結果搞完一輪搞到香港天翻地覆之後，點啊？李家超出嚟同我哋講咩啊？可以依據呢個二零一六年石棺案而家逃犯嘅做法。喂，大佬，你班天才舊年搞啲乜嘢啊？大佬，喂，建制派又～

318
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,580
但係真係好抱歉。

319
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:29,460
係唔信你？

320
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:05,430
唔係話唔畀你搞，搞咗之後係咪真係治到？即係嗰個本嘅問題咧，主席。

321
01:21:53,300 --> 01:22:00,120
今日都可以夠膽唔嚟回應我哋議員同事質詢，講緊唔係淨係民主派啊！我強調建制派都想見到佢啊！

322
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:53,020
喂，真係喎！喂，大佬呢個鄭玉華個個月出我哋納税人三十幾萬人工，有官邸住，有專車坐，食住咁多人專專人服侍嘅。

323
01:20:49,750 --> 01:21:00,000
書面處理一啲嘅程序，希望能夠盡快解決，即係唔好逼到嗰啲嘅誒積壓嘅個案太多，但係又過咗高峯期，根本就全部自相矛盾。

324
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:32,900
咁呢個係其實係一個即係好大嘅關鍵嚟。三名法官變兩名法官啊，可以啊書面處理部分程序，我聽聽落去可以減省嗰個嘅行政程序喎。按道理係咪先？

325
01:19:53,320 --> 01:20:07,290
斥呢個嘅鄭玉華，即係秘政司司長，向呢個特首叩頭，大家都知㗎啦。所以你話點樣加快程序啊？我好好簡單，要加快香港嘅程序，第一件事係炒咗鄭玉華先，OK？炒呢個律政司司長。

326
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:43,490
就係因為有呢個鄭若華，先領頭做一個捍衞法治第一人，樹一個咁差形象，先推呢個逃犯條例修訂，搞到香港天翻地覆、人心不穩。到而家你做呢啲嘅基本嘅一啲修訂嘅時間，梗係要問到讀。

327
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:59,190
我個個都唔講，我淨係講鄭耀華，我係唔信你鄭耀華啊嘛，大佬！你搞個噉嘅修訂，喂，點知你陣間修訂啲乜嘢？你一喐就喐曬所有嘅，即係司法複核嘅一個嘅審理，係一個即係牽一發動全身嘅做法嚟。我哋梗係金睛放眼望一望，喂，有咩問題先？即係究竟係點樣去改？我。

328
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:40,910
即係正經嘢又唔做喎，議員。我提一提你，亦都提一提大家易讀嘅辯論咧，係就有關今日呢條條例咧，係二零一九年成文法雜項規定條例草案喺呢條條例整體嘅優劣同埋原則係進行辯論。噉你已經咧係誒講咗一啲前言啦。請你咧係就住整體。

329
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:19,330
喂，林鄭月娥上深圳關係鬼事啊！上到去抄筆記喎，喂大佬，真係好好笑，真係小學生噉樣。佢應該坐喺度，佢講呢條緊，佢好緊張，好著緊，想快啲加強。喂，啲建制派成日都話：，哇，要加強，要加快，喂大佬，嗱嗱聲搞掂佢。係啊，係啊，係啊！你睇翻我最有趣嘅地方，即係民建聯有。

330
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:53,290
但個問題係在於，連有人權組織啊都出嚟講啦，喂，高峯期過咗㗎咯，即係講緊個號型申請嗰個數字最高峯嘅時候，你嗰個嗰個嗰個時候你搞呢類修訂或者你做呢樣嘢可能啊都合理嘅噉，高峯期過咗啦，你要搞一個咁大動作嘅修訂，喂，講緊唔。

331
01:18:53,290 --> 01:19:13,300
信你先係唔信你鄭玉華先，大佬我唔知你搞呢樣嘢，陣間又唔知下一步係揀啲乜，下一步揀啲乜，成日都要噉樣就覺得你係陰香港人喎，大佬。好啦，人權組織都話：喂，呢個動作太大，呢啲詞要修定，因為一喐就喐曬所有嘅司法複核嘅一個嘅申請啦。其次就使唔使咁大動作啦？

332
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:33,310
喂，即係講緊誒。如果你話我過咗高峯期，咁政政政府好興嘅，主席即係你啊嗰個疫情過咗高峯期咯，咪搞個全民檢測咯。結果燒咗我哋五億三千幾萬嘅公堂陰公，咁咪搞冇乜人去啊嘛。咁有陣時呢啲咪就係萬十帕定埋乜一百帕嘅問題咯。嗱，今日。

333
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:53,320
本身啊，鄭華應該坐喺度。無論係我哋民主派去質詢佢，建制派都可能好想兜好多面質詢佢嘅。呢個係一個尊重我哋立法會嘅一個嘅最基本嘅做法。結果你叫佢啲僆嚟，真係陰鬼公。當然啦，佢啲僆都唔好妥佢㗎啦。即係舊年又出個公開信，誒，即係啊幾個幾個唔同嘅監控官直直直。

334
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:10,640
原本個，甚至你個出發點好好都好。

335
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:11,180
真係唔信你喎！如果你今日坐定定喺度嘅。

336
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:07,330
動而觸動呢個高等法院條例喎。

337
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:03,150
呢個我都唔想見到㗎。我再強調，如果佢係有一個信心畀我哋。

338
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:07,710
信你嘅話，對你有信心嘅話，呢啲嘅修訂唔係一個大問題。問題係唔信你啊嘛！

339
01:23:52,660 --> 01:24:00,990
講到尾就係話，喂，不如少啲法官三變二，OK？咁然後咧就可以咧用書面去處理。但係我想講嘅根本問題。

340
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:21,490
夠膽上嚟立法會面對大家質詢，而來講畀大家聽，呢個係德政嚟嘅，誠意可嘉嘅。我哋會唔會噉樣鬧佢？會唔會噉樣炮轟佢咁耐？唔會。

341
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:52,380
但係今日我哋講嘅説法就係一個信心嘅問題，主席。當然你話，誒裏邊其實，喂，啊，議員你知唔知裏邊嗰啲嘅技術性啊，或者一啲無爭議嘅修訂係咩？梗係知啦。高等法院嘅第四章，今次佢哋主要針對由三十B、三十四B括四。

342
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:16,500
主席，哇！大佬，你冇猜度我動機先得㗎。我冇猜度你動機，不過我係請你翻返去討論整條2019年成文法集項規定條例草案嘅整體優劣。哦，噉啊，好容易啫！整體優劣咪就係唔好咯，主席。

343
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:57,300
佢先係搞到有一個咁差形象，搞到今日要連呢啲修訂都要問得咁清咁清楚嘅話，喂，佢係咪應該冚頭埋牆謝罪啊？哇，原來係我衰喺過去嘅時間真係，唉，正經嘢又唔見我做，結果一直搞到而家呢啲嘢咧，同事上到嚟又畀我哋執。

344
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:40,150
連基本禮貌都唔識啊，主席！喂，講緊可以坐喺度嗱，佢啲同事做得辛苦都對民㗎啦。我希望即係如果你個初心係好嘅，即係律政司裏邊做嘢嘅工作嘅人，希望你能夠keep住嗰個嘅心。OK，但係個頭嗱，我唔鬧個頭都好。

345
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:27,670
正經嘢又唔做，衰嘢一攞攞一大攞咁搞住我哋。主席今日呢個嘅成文法本身係一個不時會上嚟議事堂去做修訂嘅，因為你大家知即係我哋我哋行成文法㗎嘛。噉佢要喐嘅話，噉你咪做下啲技術修訂、加快個程序等等啲嘢。爭議本身不大，但係説到底就係嗰個信心問題。

346
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:49,750
因為你樹立咗一個好差形象，由律政司以至到整個林鄭政府，大家望住立法會開翻會第一件事，梗係捉你回水，全民回水一萬蚊嗱嗱聲解決個疫情帶嚟嗰個疲弊不堪、嗰個經濟嘅下滑。你唔係同我哋搞喂加翻程序，誒法官三變二。

347
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:25,950
其實而家好多朋友、好多市民就望住個即係立法會直播，你會話以往啊，即係歷任咁多個律政司啊，處理呢類嘅條例草案，會唔會喺二讀階段咁鬼多人發言，甚至乎要話郭榮鏗頭先同你辯論三權分立，都要畀人識麥嚇，真係即係非常之罕見啦。

348
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:20,410
喂，好耐冇見啦！佢佢相關嗰個委員會係冇嚟過嘅，主席。康俊宇議員，我留意你咧多次發言都係針對就係話啊嘛，鄭若華司長點解唔出席會議？我想請議員插息誒，主席咧較早前已經收到政府當局嘅書面通知，憑藉律政人員條例第七章。

349
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:40,420
喺律政司司長缺席期間，法律政策專員咧已獲授權喺立法會會議上參與處理條例草案嘅審議程序，而秘書處咧亦都已經喺開會前書面通知議員有關嘅安排，誒請抗議員咧翻翻去議讀條例草。

350
01:22:40,420 --> 01:23:00,430
草案嘅討論內容就係就係二零一九年成文法雜項規定條例草案嘅優劣，而唔係咧係在借住呢一個發言機會咧，係表達你其他嘅政治意見或者立場。否則咧，我亦都會視你為離題嘅。抗議員，請你翻返去點啊！即係有信息，我咪又。

351
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,350
同時，即係今日咧，討論呢一個嘅。

352
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:10,280
去深圳，呢個鄭若華又跟你走咗去深上深圳，都唔知做乜。

353
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,680
成文法嘅修訂，説到底就究竟係唔係治標不治本？

354
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:48,520
如果你呢個嘅原意係好嘅，你個人係做得好嘅，我哋唔會咁多問題。

355
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:45,330
呢一類技術性嘅修訂，換作喺兩至三年前喺呢個議事堂發生，係唔會有咁多辯論。

356
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:36,970
偶遇今日連坐都唔坐喺度嘅話，即係你教我點樣唔可以招呼你咧？主席，本人僅此層次。

357
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:38,590
因為事實上各位真係不遺餘力，誒，所以咧，主席，嗱，我進入最後一分鐘，我只係想講，其實咧。

358
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:42,660
修定呢一個嘅高等法院條例，我唔信啊嘛！我一定要喺呢一個議事堂度留到一個記錄，就係話：喂，唔好意思，點解要麻煩到你？係唔好意思，因為你麻煩到我，麻煩到我哋香港人。

359
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:20,610
條文嘅優劣，你你嘅論點咧，頭先嗰個點好清楚㗎啦。主席聽到，我仲有兩分半鐘都唔夠，噉啊，等我梗係收個總結啦，係咪先？即係我簡單。

360
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:36,790
講過㗎啦。嗱，頭先我前面講得好清楚。如果鄭若華喺過去嘅時間去能夠樹立一個非常之好嘅律政司榜樣，然後畀我哋嘅公眾大眾對呢一個嘅司法系統有絕對信心嘅話，呢一類嘅集行規定嘅條例草案嘅修訂，基本上可以即係話上到嚟根本冇乜人會特登要進入辯論。

361
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:31,110
同以往好多嘢一樣啊！就主席過去一年，即係你嫌我哋喺度講都好，實講到你煩嘅。同你講，我大把嘢講啊，同你講講兩個鐘都得。你諗下嗰啲咩限制令，個起初都好好啊，完結保持社交距離，唔好等病毒擴散。結果又咪信咗佢，信咗佢咪又中招啊！而家你上嚟。

362
01:25:48,800 --> 01:26:08,810
有幾多人啊？即係即係老實講，有我陰公啊！真係原本諗住舉個例子，諗諗林政府裏邊有邊個官比較好上到嚟，唔會畀人質添有冇冇冇乜添陰公啊！真係真係冇辦法，因為成個嘅林鄭班子嘅分數已經一跌再跌，跌到真唔清楚。當著議員，我都提醒咗你啦。請你咧係翻翻去整體。

363
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:51,060
我早幾日咧，我就去咗呢個CIC，即係頭先嘅同事講過，青山灣嗰個嘅即係入境嗰個嘅機構裏邊咧，去探望一啲可能係因事而啊，即係被拘留嘅人士。噉啊，當然唔同故事啦。OK，噉啊，咁咧，噉啊，其實誒成日都話嘅，即係究竟點樣去完善解決？

364
01:26:51,060 --> 01:27:11,070
呢個問題係咪要從培訓着手咧？講緊唔係淨係法院。喂，法院咧，其實佢哋個壓力固然之，但係我哋當然明白。咁但係而家個高峯期，頭先我講過啦，人權組織就高峯期過咗。你做呢個修訂，究竟你心裏邊有冇啲奇怪嘅諗法，或啲唔好嘅好唔好嘅念頭收埋喺裏邊？啊，魔鬼在細節。我哋緊係諗下諗。

365
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:31,080
諗下米啦，喂，大佬，我哋殘餘畀我哋嘅一啲珍貴嘅價值、獨立嘅司法系統，喂，畀你鬱少一隻字就鬱少一隻字啦。喺我哋角度真係，尤其是你鄭玉華，如果你想鬱呢一類嘅條例，想可以喺議事堂度即係過得流暢嘅，換咗你自己先，換咗鄭玉華先。我相信《東方日報》都唔會反對。

366
01:27:46,200 --> 01:28:06,210
最大問題係林鄭政府自己要諗一諗，喺過去嘅一年多對香港做過啲乜嘢？先係運動，後係疫情，第三波疫情摧殘成個香港，佢完全唔需要負責嘅。一個先都冇賠畀所有嘅食店，叫你派錢派派派派到今日，本身應該要喺宣佈呢個嘅施政報告之際走咗。

367
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:31,610
李議員。

368
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,220
第三。

369
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:18,210
喺。

370
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,350
第二。

371
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,030
都曾經。

372
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,120
係成為一種禁語。

373
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:06,360
同埋另外一位法官陳兆海。

374
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:02,410
前中審法院首席法官李國能。

375
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:53,430
嘅背景資料講，香港係實行三權分立。

376
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:37,000
我就唔知幾時咧喺香港三權分立呢個字咧。

377
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:13,760
係表示得清清楚楚，香港係實行三權分立。

378
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:48,670
喂，呢個唔係禁語嚟喎！回歸前一九九七年六月，當時特區政府畀各個國家同埋記者。

379
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:47,870
制衡法院嘅作用係確保立法同埋行政機關喺執行其職能時遵守基本法同埋法律。呢個係寫喺香港嗰度嘅。

380
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:29,340
係會視大家為離題，請大家咧係善用時間。議會咧有好多事情咧係等住我哋去做嘅，噉我希望大家都一齊努力。郭家麒議員。

381
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:30,620
關你咩事咧？即係你你林鄭就係要見習習近平咧，大佬！而家全世界就等你全民回水，冇冇得掹嘅。你再遲啲嘅話，當我經濟崩潰嘅時間，你到時再派錢都嚟唔切。我哋個訴求好簡單，就預咗喺議事堂度做民生嘢。哦，但係你你個鄭月話誠意不足，敗事又～

382
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:58,020
喺我請下一位議員發言前咧，我再次提醒大家就住2019年成文法雜項規定條例草案呢一條咧，其實大家都掌握啦，亦都已經有十二位議員先後發言，其實一個技術性修訂，我哋議會時間咧已經用咗幾個小時啦，所以我作為主席咧，我有責任咧係要確保議。

383
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:18,030
員發言咧係符合議事規則，噉我亦都提醒議員咧。請大家發言嘅時候咧，如果之前已經有論述嘅，亦都盡量簡短或者不需要重複。如果議員發言嘅時候咧，直住今次嘅發言咧係啊大幅偏離、大幅偏離條例草案嘅整體優劣咧，我亦都。

384
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:38,710
二零零一年，當時嘅中審法院李國能喺香港業業工會同埋好多個商會舉辦嘅午餐上講司法獨立嘅時候，都講得好清楚。司法獨立係權力分立概念嘅核心，權力分立就係行政、立法同埋司法三權分立，互相。

385
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,000
香港嘅法例嘅基本係司法。

386
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:20,920
即係佢話，將來佢審任何案嘅時候，佢望一望，唉。

387
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:15,360
二零二零年嘅施政報告，而家點啊？成扎人去曬擦鞋啦！

388
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:21,380
鄭若華都去咗擦鞋啦，去揼低個頭喺度寫嘢啦，係唔需要你。

389
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:02,040
司法獨立、三權分立啊嘛，不過大家睇下，擘大隻眼睇有啲咩嘢發生，而家係。

390
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:09,280
去到禮崩樂壞嘅時候，今日原本喺呢度唔係傾呢樣嘢，要講呢個。

391
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:55,620
行呢條法律，行呢個二零一九成文法，就係因為我哋相信香港仍然有。

392
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:48,170
呢個係最基本嘅原則。如果連呢樣嘢都唔知嘅，唔好喺呢度傾，亦都唔需要嘥大家嘅時間。

393
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:30,470
禮賓落嗌落壞，去到而家呢個情況係夾硬攝一條。其實原本唔係應該拎出嚟講嘅，大家都知道㗎，唔好做戲啦。

394
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:16,700
如果將來個法官係冇司法嘅獨立，當佢去要判任何案，根據二零一九成文法集行規定嘅時候，佢判乜嘢案？

395
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:42,660
今日係要講施政報告，聽日係要答問大會，係講二零二零香港嘅新一年嘅施政啊嘛！而家話疫情好慘，經濟好慘，樣都好慘，跟住而家唔記得啊！

396
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:42,130
草案整體優劣進行辯論，郭議員，請你指出你頭先嘅討論點樣同呢個辯論整體優劣有相關咧？否則你就要翻返嚟啦。呢個二零一九成文法集項規定條例草案係香港嘅法例。

397
01:31:46,430 --> 01:32:05,180
立法同埋行政三權各司其職，呢個係香港最基本嘅制度。如果三個地方行政、立法同埋司法冇法子獨立去進行佢嘅職責，何來去執行任何嘅法律？包括二零一九年成文法。

398
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:40,700
啊！個特首唔知佢想我點判咧，識唔識做咧？又睇下立法會當時準唔準講咧？咁咁香港仲有法治？喂！法治嘅基石係建基於無論嘅任何法律，而家講緊2019成文法或者任何喺本會通過法律，都係建基於司法獨立。

399
01:30:48,150 --> 01:31:08,160
國家奇議員，誒，正如我提醒各位議員，議員，我而家講緊係一個法律，絕對係可以討論，不過咧係要起一個合適場合。大家如果要討論三權分立咧，可以考慮喺事務委員會選舉完成之後咧，去到事務委員會去討論，或者咧係用議員嘅時間啊。

400
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:28,170
誒進進行一啲咧議員議案嘅辯論。今日我哋每個立法會議程有好獨特嘅議題要去討論。各議員你係資深議員，你好清楚。我頭先已經提醒啦，咁請大家咧係翻翻嚟二零一九年成文法雜項規定條例草案嘅議讀辯論，即係就住條例。

401
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,370
嘅基石。

402
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,640
揾個理由講大話，哎呀！我而家～

403
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:42,890
喺香港嘅司法制度面臨崩潰啊！

404
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,930
喂，大家知道而家發生咩事？而家我哋見得到嘅就係。

405
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,830
佢話咧，民事訴嘅案件數量急升。

406
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:52,660
誒要下個呢個月尾要見北京嘅官，下個月先嚟講，有冇搞錯？

407
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:20,830
香港仍然有三權分立啊嘛，所以我哋先至喺呢度聲嘶力竭，希望係有人聽得到啊嘛。

408
01:33:53,220 --> 01:34:00,780
我哋而家講唔係唔重要，成文法都重要，因為呢個係涉及香港司法。

409
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:21,580
免遣犯聲稱嘅申請嘅司法覆核多咗，於是乎咧就為咗合理化呢一個錯誤嘅做法咧。

410
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:13,390
所有喺法院嘅判決，咁當然梗係要等立法會去通過啦。所以點解我哋先至要出嚟講咧？我哋無論係真心假意，我哋都希望。

411
01:34:55,120 --> 01:35:06,750
即係我希望阿梁美芬之流嗰啲聽下，等佢知道自己醒下自己講啲咩嘢。我哋而家講緊呢一條條例，高等法院條例第四章係講啲咩嘢？

412
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:54,840
可以喺合適嘅場合，但係不是而家辯論二零一九年成文法集項規定偷條例草案二讀辯論嘅時。知道收到。我最後一次提醒你，你唔使警告我，我唔驚㗎。

413
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:34,930
就係要將呢一個高等法院條例三十四B括弧四由兩定明兩個上訴法官組成嘅上訴法庭咧，可以裁定嗰兩個處境啊嘛。

414
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:17,510
拎出嚟公審，呢啲點樣去維護法治啊？將來如果有呢一個根據高等法院條例第四章有一個高等法院嘅上訴庭嘅法官唔啱佢使嘅，又拎出嚟鞭撻啦。

415
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:42,750
你而家話畀我哋聽，三權分立係一個禁語，係唔準講。阿郭家麒議員嗱，我再一次、最後一次提醒你，我再次重申呢一個場合不是討論司法。我唔係講緊司法，我而家講緊呢個成文法啦，李議員。誒，三權分立不是本會嘅禁忌語言。大家如果要討論，

416
01:35:44,340 --> 01:36:04,350
其實而家我哋唔係講緊，淨係呢個三十四B括弧四嘅。其實所有而家香港嘅法治，大家都見得到係點啊？中意就捉個裁判官嚟鬧，即係好似啊郭佩凡啊周浩鼎嗰啲。喂判案啊！佢哋而家口聲聲話要尊重法治㗎嘛，拎出嚟制。

417
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,650
原本。

418
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,800
起訴嘅文件。

419
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,160
法院。

420
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,000
亦都係。

421
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,020
都係舉步維艱。

422
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:34,450
都係成為咗打壓嘅工具。

423
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,480
我哋見到而家所有。

424
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,860
無論係律政嘅部門、執法嘅部門。

425
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,410
除咗呢條條例以外嘅其他所有嘅條例嘅執行。

426
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:02,820
係只係一個成個公訴嘅一部分，佢需要咧。

427
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,200
律政嘅部門咧，係公正不阿地咧，係去作出。

428
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:08,220
包括係啊執法個部門係公正不阿地去執法。

429
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:41,940
我哋而家講緊，希望係維護香港嘅法治，其實好睏難。

430
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:34,980
唔會令到香港嘅法治更加好㗎，有啲噉嘅人喺度存在，有啲法盲喺度批評法官。

431
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:26,370
拎嚟公審啦，係咪啊？呢啲叫法子寫咗落去都冇用啦！大家都知道，你改變咗呢一條條例。

432
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:26,120
大老實實，今時今日，呢啲已經淪為一啲等同於第三世界落後國家極權政府嘅做法。

433
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:19,900
一個局面。

434
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,910
點樣去維護？

435
01:39:22,730 --> 01:39:24,500
點解維護呢個法治啊？

436
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:13,320
成個法治都崩潰啊！

437
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:10,710
係成個司法制度。

438
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,910
會令到我哋更加相信呢個法治。

439
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:53,140
喺噉嘅情況底下，呢一啲噉嘅條例。

440
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:18,290
全部係做出嚟嘅一個一個情況。

441
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:41,180
我唔知幾時呢一啲嘅，我哋喺呢個立法會提嘅所有嘅法案咧。

442
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:19,560
專員冇理由唔知㗎，做咁耐律師喺度辦所，唔知道而家我哋發生咩事？

443
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:47,050
完全冇信心，係負幾多分？而家講緊係負四十啊，負五十，因為負一百分。

444
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:07,700
我哋而家面對嘅困難就當然唔係淨係呢一個高等法院條例第三十四B括弧四咁簡單啦。

445
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:49,950
將來都成為打壓嘅工具，或者係政權咧，係希望用以令以改變或者摧毀一國兩制嘅做法。

446
01:37:50,410 --> 01:38:00,460
大家都知道，唔使好耐，可能分鐘一下個月就拎條嗰個點啊選新嘅選舉法出嚟，大灣區都有得投票啊，等等都嚟。

447
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:12,390
可以隨隨便便，嗰啲法官點出嚟啊！呢個呢啲啱聽啊，拎出嚟佢可以審法某一啲嘅法案，誒一啲法例咩國安法噉樣，呢一集得嗰集唔得。

448
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:11,000
去達到。

449
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,130
係更加快去行。

450
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,490
一啲行政當局嘅目的。

451
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:48,130
如果一個正常嘅情況底下，

452
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:47,970
免責辯論條本嘅入邊。

453
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:27,960
所以先至喺今次，包括今次嘅。

454
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:24,150
而家係我哋冇法子去信呢個制度啊嘛！

455
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:44,470
而家我哋講緊，包括係。

456
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:29,040
唔可以度做戲啦！而家行出嚟改呢一條條例。

457
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:53,630
我哋仲可能會諗想像一下啊！我哋香港仍然有一個。

458
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:44,990
由三個原本係應該上訴庭嘅法官改到兩個。

459
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:19,890
而唔係原本法院或者司法制度應該要有嘅功能啊嘛！

460
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:59,990
法治有三權分立，有一個清清楚楚嘅制度，但係而家呢啲嘢全部不存在。

461
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:37,200
口口聲聲話令到香港嗰個司法制度更加好，希望啲應該要審嘅案咧。

462
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:08,470
全部不存在嘅，你改咗落去，只會利用有人更加利用呢一啲空檔、呢啲空隙。

463
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:39,810
討論嗰度係有咁多對於而家嘅狀況，包括三權分立被摧毀、司法制度被摧毀咧，我哋咁大嘅保留。

464
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:32,280
但係而家唔係。

465
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:50,080
講緊嘅。

466
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,380
有你哋個初心係啲乜嘢咧？

467
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,170
而家係對成個制度嘅崩潰。

468
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,580
係有一啲改變，令到個法例係更加好。

469
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,480
就算過咗呢個二零一九成文法啊！

470
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:30,560
係一個公平公正嘅制度，係作出佢嘅申述。

471
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:41,770
唔使好耐，我哋嘅法治嘅情況就同嗰啲。

472
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:04,340
呢啲都係見機，我哋係相信呢個法治。

473
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:37,400
而家係可以亂曬大龍，而家係可以令到香港。

474
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:55,120
我唔知坐喺度嗰啲律政嘅人員有任何嘅顏面。

475
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:10,350
相信法院，相信一個制度能夠保障到香港人。

476
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:56,680
舉個例，係咪需要喺個條文中嘅中文嘅陳述入邊？

477
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:49,590
全世界由尾數上嚟嗰啲非誒亞非拉嗰啲嘅極權政府咧，係一模一樣。

478
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:08,080
去維護呢一個崩潰嘅制度，呢個噉嘅律政司，呢個噉嘅政府，呢個噉樣做出嚟嘅嘢，你有少少嘅顏面去諗下自己做緊啲咩嘢？

479
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:26,510
保障到呢一個公平受審嘅機會，保障到每一個香港人，或者甚至一啲聲有呢個聲稱嘅一啲嘅求助嘅難民，係需要一個機會咧。

480
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:41,190
係咪而家我哋見到嘅香港係極之困難嘅情況？市民對於成個政府嘅信任，對於律政司、律政署、警察所有呢啲原本係應該係維護香港法治、維護香港一國兩制嘅部門同埋執行嘅隊伍咧，係完。

481
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:19,670
咁點樣去做咧？

482
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,260
係我哋嘅。

483
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,350
係可以隨意咧。

484
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,790
就好似啲老師嘅一樣。

485
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,980
去鞭撻佢，打壓佢。

486
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:19,090
你估香港人會覺得係更加好？

487
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:30,290
而家法院甚至法官，大家都睇到。

488
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:17,820
不能夠完善法治嘅一個部門。

489
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:36,720
用一啲文革式嘅打壓抽出嚟。

490
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:35,420
誒Justice Center入邊，其中一個講得好清楚嘅。

491
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:13,590
如果我哋個高等法院嘅條例係交咗一個唔合適，

492
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:57,580
係點樣去解釋一啲市民嘅權利？係我翻緊嚟啊！

493
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:26,760
會令到我哋更加相信呢個法院係會公平公正地係不受其他人嘅影響，梗係唔會啦。

494
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:28,510
呢一啲嘅難民嘅誒聲稱，又點樣可以得到去真正去做咧？嗱，我想引用翻，引用翻咧。

495
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:50,910
成為工具，甚至律政署入邊嘅，如果有一啲早排啲有一個律政署嘅檢控官，就係因為寫一本書。

496
01:42:58,290 --> 01:43:07,720
咁呢啲都係同翻我哋維護法治，根據呢個高等法院條例第四二同埋四五二入邊係要求嘅嘢嚟㗎嘛？

497
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:52,070
行政上個安排。

498
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,830
我哋嘅所謂嘅。

499
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:04,720
係最極權嘅，包括中非啊！

500
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:45,260
係最重要，好可惜。

501
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,630
成為呢個難民以外，呢個係受到質疑。

502
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:04,450
我哋不能夠避免，就係面對。

503
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:48,630
香港嘅制度已經係面臨崩潰。

504
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,860
三權分立嘅時候，香港嘅法治。

505
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:49,390
而家嘅情況就係經過呢一個。

506
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:21,410
你認為做咗呢一個成文法會令到香港更加有顏面？

507
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:11,080
亞門啊，等等一啲嘅難民嘅申請咧，係好容易咧，係被排除。

508
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:42,010
佢話：去維護一個公平嘅標準咧。

509
01:43:55,110 --> 01:44:01,710
USM即係聯合嘅評估機制，係可以將一啲世界上其中一啲。

510
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:29,480
會令到我哋更加係受到國際上嘅尊重，係一個法治嘅地方。我相信不可能。

511
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:40,860
當呢個政府一連串嘅舉動，包括呢個楊潤雄啊，包括呢個七七七林鄭行出嚟公然講香港冇。

512
01:44:48,960 --> 01:45:00,430
無論我哋喺呢一度用幾多個心力去對於呢一啲嘅唔同嘅法例，好似今次講嘅成文法等等，係作出認真嘅辯論都好。

513
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:55,270
主席。

514
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,340
法治不彰。

515
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,900
我亦都希望。

516
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:37,720
公平嘅制度。

517
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:42,940
我哋不能夠。

518
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,060
喺律政司處。

519
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,280
而家香港嘅處境。

520
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,750
郭家麒議員點算法定人數？

521
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,530
我哋而家一定要明白。

522
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:40,910
如果連個初心都冇嘅，

523
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,060
入邊做嘅好多。

524
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:23,240
一啲檢控嘅人士明白。

525
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:46,770
係繼續落去一國兩制係玩完。

526
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:35,050
係為一個政府去做事，而唔係維持一個。

527
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:29,100
而家律政署律政司只係被視為一個政治檢控嘅一個部門。

528
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:54,190
無論點都好，呢一啲嘅成文法，如果係喺而家呢個制度咧，係不能夠彰顯嘅。

529
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:29,530
嗯。

530
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:17,600
係。

531
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:12,720
他們後裔。

532
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:21,110
咁其實呢一條嘅二零一九。
