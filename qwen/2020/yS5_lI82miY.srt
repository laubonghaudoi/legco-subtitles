11
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:31,780
咁誒聯合小組委員會喺二零一九年十一月廿五號會議嘅紀要咧，已經發送咗畀各位委員㗎啦。截至而家為止咧，秘書處就冇收到委員提出任何修訂嘅。咁邀請各位委員確認呢份會議紀要，大家有冇意見？

12
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:18,020
我理解，當局會以電腦投影片嘅作為介紹嘅。誒，主席，誒喺誒，首先我好多謝議員咧，喺三月二十號嘅財委會會議咧，係通過咗有關西九綜合地庫二區同埋藝術廣場天橋合共。

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:51,260
如果冇嘅確認，議程嘅第二項，由上次會議發出嘅資料文件，上次會議之後咧就收到陳淑莊議員一位信件，咁嗰個信件咧因為係好遲先收到嘅，噉我哋咧就已經印發咗，就放咗喺各位嘅台上面嘅啦，請大家備悉。

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:12,270
第三逾期參加委員會嘅申請係立法會文件C.B.括弧一四二四斜棟一九至二零括弧零一號文件。劉國芬議員咧喺二零二零年三月十二號致函主席，表示希望加入聯合小組委員會。誒，劉議員嘅函件誒，即係頭先講啊啊嗰個。

15
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:38,310
合共一百七十八億嘅撥款。咁今日咧係西九管理局咧會就住第二區嘅發展咧係向委員彙報嘅。噉我知道咧委員一向咧亦都好關注西九文化區與周邊地區嘅連接。誒，所以咧今日西九管理局咧亦都會就西九嘅交通配套啦、陸路同埋水路嘅交通運輸，以致行。

16
00:03:46,690 --> 00:04:06,700
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just going to say a few remarks. I can add my thanks to the Permanent Secretary's comments earlier for members' approval to the budget for the Artist Square Bridge and the integrated basement. We really do appreciate it, and the reason is it's a key milestone to bring the West Kowloon Cultural.

17
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,580
round.

18
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,050
And I've got a few slides to show how we build around that.

19
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,190
呢個係一個非常重要的議題。

20
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,340
So I'd like to hand hand over to Jeremy to take us through the PowerPoint presentation, Mr. Chairman.

21
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,940
And I'm pleased to say that since the funding was given, I think towards the end of March.

22
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:49,840
更多 jobs、新機會 for business in the creative industries and tourism， will follow as we develop the new areas and deliver West Kaloon for the community.

23
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:29,940
for fire trucks, that sort of thing. So we we we have to build around all these constraints in in in developing the zone two area.

24
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:32,740
We're now ready to push ahead in the next week or so with the first construction contract in the zone two area.

25
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:39,790
The future artist square bridge, particularly relevant to the conversation that we're going to have this afternoon on connectivity, will also make the district much more accessible by the public. So it is an important step for us.

26
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:23,960
We'll be delighted to brief members on that. I will just say that in fact we released the tender invitation to tender documents today, and we're looking forward to see the results of that tender process in a few months' time.

27
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you, Duncan. Good afternoon, members, and also my thanks that we're here today to present the progress of what we call the Zone Two, which is the central area of the of the project here. And just on the screen there, you can see it's.

28
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:27,630
它會 allow the district to move ahead both with the remaining cultural, but equally important in terms of sustainability, the commercial developments in the area. In particular, the hotel, office, residential development is an important source of recurrent income for the authority, and therefore the long-term sustainability.

29
00:04:50,120 --> 00:05:10,130
We will be dealing with two important issues today. One is of course connectivity and the zone to be development. The second is the what we call the ACE project, and that is in fact the first of our commercial releases under the BOT arrangement. So.

30
00:05:49,280 --> 00:06:09,290
Highlighted in a red dotted line. I think many of you will know that this area has been occupied for some time by the MTRC XRL project. So finally now it's all been handed back, and you know we've been working on.

31
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,030
嗯。

32
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,620
and.

33
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,940
你可以見到，呢個係一個地下空間。

34
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,140
and you can see zone two B and zone two C is divided.

35
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,040
by what we call the sort of central avenue.

36
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,370
跟著，zone two B， and zone two C。

37
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,430
which is the area we build around the XRL station.

38
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,510
所以，我們已經做很多工作在頂部規劃。

39
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,730
For example, the music centre, the great theatre, and the musical theatre on that south side.

40
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,870
Zone Two B， you can see the grey blocks there。 They are mainly commercial blocks。

41
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:45,860
which is already built, and we will be demolishing the temporary slab and exposing this space, so that we can push ahead and build the basement.

42
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:58,050
In this area, which will be obviously used to serve the future offices and commercial and our art and cultural venues above.

43
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:08,280
For our future revenue, and then on the southern side, zone 2C, those are our core art and cultural facilities. So you can see there highlighted in yellow.

44
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:12,850
Here's a sort of diagrammatic drawing of the whole zone two area, and you can you can see that we've divided it into three zones: zone two A.

45
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:39,690
There's a scheme here which we've basically made efficient, and it's called an amalgamated scheme, and it's where we've looked at some of the commercial blocks in the zone 2B area.

46
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:47,200
That will link Artist Square, which is near the Lyric Theatre and M+, all the way down the central spine to what we call Central Square, and that area will sort of merge into where the XRL project is.

47
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:53,830
So just this second slide up here, you can see the red line there, which is actually the XRL station. That that is a big box which is sitting in the ground. You know, I think it's five five stories below ground. So it's quite a quite a significant thing to be building.

48
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:19,580
On the ground level in that zone two area, you can see there's a lot of structures which we have to take account of. These are ventilation structures which are serving the XRL station, means of escape, means of access, EVAs.

49
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,590
但most of the basement.

50
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,710
It'll be the best thing.

51
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,810
for the public to enjoy.

52
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,310
That basically.

53
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,480
which the development plan is obviously based on.

54
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,140
and this will have a roundabout for vehicles.

55
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,820
但我們實際上把塊與塊之間用連接物連接起來。

56
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,470
the the red part in the plan above, this is 300 metres by 200 metres.

57
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,870
Come from the underpass in access up here. There's a big roundabout area.

58
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,320
going back to the original Foster's master plan was about putting all the traffic and all the noise.

59
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,900
你可以 see this is zone two A. 你可以 see what a big area it is. 你 know.

60
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:47,090
and maintaining, we've done our best to maintain the original Foster's master plan.

61
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:44,420
And this will eventually go to Canton Road. There will be a link that eventually goes through to Canton Road.

62
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,150
the plant rooms etc underground, so that we would leave the zone two area above.

63
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:11,640
free from traffic, plant rooms etc. for the public to enjoy. So we really have kept the original vision.

64
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:08,470
between them, so that we can achieve better floor plates, which will certainly help, you know, the commercial side and the revenue side in future offices.

65
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,850
所以，just another.

66
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,920
the。

67
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,590
和 lifts。

68
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,860
And then you can go up to the top side to enjoy.

69
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,580
Areas in the middle called zones two B and two C, which I highlighted earlier.

70
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,350
part of the funding that was approved in March.

71
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,600
幾年時間，我們可以 obviously push ahead with the construction for both 2B and 2C.

72
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,790
And we're pushing ahead with tendering that out, so that in a

73
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:28,310
In the next week or two, and that's the foundations and the cofferdam.

74
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:20,160
So this zone 2A area, just to finish on the construction side, we are imminently about to start construction.

75
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:38,500
And then later on, we will award a contract to build the basement structures, and then separately the top side above.

76
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:26,370
And the area below will also be for drop-off, so taxis, buses, all that sort of thing will be able to drive through to the basement.

77
00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:05,190
is for the detailed design of those two areas. At the moment, we've just done the prelim design, so the detailed design of 2B and 2C was also part of that funding.

78
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:39,630
You probably see the underpass at the moment, the quite complicated underpass near Austin Road West and Canton Road. So you will go in that underpass, access off there, drop into the West Kowloon District.

79
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:33,320
So I'll just hand over to my colleague YC, who will just take take you through the connectivity of this whole basement area with the rest of the district. Thanks, YC.

80
00:11:47,460 --> 00:12:07,470
drawing of the zone 2A area, obviously car parking. We also have in the lower floors, the second basement floor is where people can park their vehicles, and then obviously go up to the top side on via escalator.

81
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,450
啊！

82
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,440
啊！

83
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,510
個停車位。

84
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,980
西九文化區嘅。

85
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,920
亦都係係有誒的士停泊嘅地方。

86
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,150
好，唔該，Jeremy。嗯，以下咧，我有誒。

87
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,570
其實對出咧誒一個東閘嘅地方咧，我哋都係有一個的士嘅停泊嘅地方。

88
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:39,580
咧係會經過九龍站，另外一條咧就係由誒去到誒東邊戲曲嗰邊，另外一條嘅綠色專線。

89
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:22,270
誒至於的士方面咧，其實喺圖裏邊見到咧，誒現有咧，我哋喺誒公園裏邊咧，都有一個的士嘅泊位喺誒戲曲中心。

90
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:47,950
幾張slide咧就係講一講關於西九嘅誒交通配套啊，同埋各方面咧係誒方便市民咧可以去到依個誒。

91
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:50,780
誒喺繁忙嘅時候咧，我哋都會誒有一條咧係二九六D嘅巴士線咧，係駛入去呢個誒西面嘅藝術公園嗰邊。

92
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:11,580
噉我哋咧亦都係同誒誒有關嘅誒綠色嘅小巴嘅經營商同埋運輸處咧係聯絡。如果我哋有一啲嘅誒大型嘅表演節目啊，我哋咧係會預先通知佢哋，將令到佢哋咧可以係增加呢個嘅班次。

93
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:12,000
其實而家喺西九文化區裏邊咧，誒喺西隧嘅入口咧，其實都有三十多條嘅巴士線，誒由由誒香港島過嚟誒，就經過誒西九文化區嘅西面嘅入口咧，就一路去到誒西面啊、屯門啊、元朗嗰邊。

94
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:32,290
咁喺二零一九年嘅十一月咧，其實我哋都開始咗咧，呢張slide咧就主要講我哋開始咗咧係有三條嘅綠色小巴專線，誒就有兩條咧就係誒廿六D同埋七十四D咧就係會係入去依個西九文化區嘅誒藝術公園嘅，誒亦都。

95
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:48,860
誒將來咧，如果我哋誒喺第二期Song Two嗰邊落成之後咧，大家可以見到咧喺誒地底行車路下邊咧係有誒多個咧係的士停泊嘅地方，可以上落誒上落乘客。誒將來嘅戲曲中心同或者咧係誒展覽中心咧。

96
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:13,430
至於停車位方面咧，依張圖咧就誒大致上咧可以顯示到咧有幾多個停車位喺西九文化區裏邊咧，係有大約誒總共咧係有二千多個誒泊車嘅位置誒。頭先都講到咧喺松二嘅地方裏邊咧，大約係有一千三百至一千四百。

97
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,230
啊，另外咧，我哋。

98

未來嘅一一個月、兩個月之內咧，我哋就會誒誒，即係。

103
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:29,180
誒呢條天橋嘅樣咧，大致上咧就係誒喺而家大家嘅誒圖表上邊咧，個個slide上邊可以見到。

104
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:21,210
判出呢一條嘅誒行人天橋嘅標咧，預早開始咧係興建，預計咧會喺誒二零二二年之前咧係會誒完工㗎。

105
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:15,550
下年咧，當依個M加博物館開放嘅時候咧，我哋都有一百五十個咧係泊車位嘅地方，咁所以總數咧，我都相信咧係可以係誒足夠咧係第時嗰個誒運作嘅需要。

106
00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:08,570
天站誒連接嘅誒藍色嘅部分咧，就係戲曲中心。咁中間咧係誒淺綠色嘅地方咧，就係依個連接嘅行人隧道。誒將柯士甸站同埋咧戲曲中心咧係駁通。啊駁通咗之後咧就。

107
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:34,960
嗱，現在咧，其實西九西九文化區咧已經係有三百個停車位咧，其實已經開放咗㗎啦。誒，包括咗咧就係誒途中大家見到咧係有一個二百一十個停車位嘅地方咧，喺地庫下邊咧係已經開放咗咧，係可以咧係誒。

109
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:36,780
啊，至於行人嘅接駁方面咧，誒頭先都提過咧，係主要我哋而家啱啱喺財委會咧係批准咗一個誒興建一條嘅行人嘅天橋咧，喺西面嘅地方咧，主要就係連接九龍站誒駁過嚟咧，誒去到咧呢個藝術廣場。咁呢條天橋咧。

110
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:56,790
係直接咧，可以將誒市民或者係旅客咧，可以由呢個九龍站或者係機鐵嘅站咧，直接由九龍站咧係行呢個誒Element裏邊咧，係通過呢一條嘅誒天橋咧，係落到去呢個藝術廣場，亦都咧行到去誒M交。

111
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:52,520
誒有一條嘅行人隧道咧，喺東邊即係連接戲谷中心同埋咧係誒柯士甸站咧，亦都正在興建。誒依條依條行人隧道咧係誒已經差唔多係八十個percent咧，已經係起好㗎啦。誒大家喺圖表上面見到咧，黃色嘅部分咧就係柯士。

112
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,190
啊。

113
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,470
咁咧就誒。

114
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,180

另外咧喺誒。

116
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,010
係交翻畀誒政府有關部門咧，係去誒接管。

117
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,750
誒呢張圖咧，基本上就睇到嗰個位置咧，就係紅色圈呢個位置。

118
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,510
誒依條嘅行人隧道咧，我哋預計會喺今年嘅第四季咧係會開通嘅。

119
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,690
線咧係應該係點樣做？咁大致上呢張圖咧都表現到嗰個誒天橋。

120
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:38,710
接駁出誒三號幹線嘅嘅情況係點樣？亦都咧係駁通咗亞長道咧嘅高架天橋嘅。

121
00:19:51,800 --> 00:20:03,290
總共咧就有七個站可以連接到西面嘅入口啦，啊，連接到我哋嘅公園啦，亦都咧可以去到誒自由空間啊，同埋咧誒依個M加嘅展亭裏邊。

122
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:22,910
誒乘客咧或者市民咧可以直接由柯士甸站咧就行過去呢條隧道咧，就可以去到呢個戲谷中心誒嘅地庫，然之後咧係上翻戲谷中心咧，亦都係穿過咗之後咧，可以去到誒廣東道。

123
00:20:47,720 --> 00:21:04,230
西面咧，即係喺誒西區海底隧道嗰方面嘅入口嗰邊咧，我哋都希望咧係開通一條嘅出路咧，讓到咧係汽車咧可以喺西面咧係直接出去三號幹線，係誒疏解咗咧係誒。

124
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:44,320
噉我哋咧將會將會繼續咧係試行，亦都希望喺誒西九嘅一啲內部嘅道路裏邊咧，同政府有關部門咧係商討睇下可唔可以喺誒西九範圍裏邊嘅車路咧同誒運行咧同其他嘅車車咧係睇下可唔可以測試進一步嘅融合。

125
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:50,270
誒另外咧就係誒呢個誒電動誒智能嘅誒自動車咁呢個智能車咧，其實我哋喺二零誒一四年咧已經係開始推出，都有幾年嘅時間。我哋而家咧將呢條嘅智能車嘅通道咧係增加到到三公里長噉。

126
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:23,580
咁咧誒，到而家為止，直到去誒二零一九年底咧，其實咧已經誒，我哋超過咧係一萬二千個乘客咧，係坐過依個誒無人駕駛嘅智能車，亦都咧我哋有好好嘅誒，得到咧好好嘅評分咧，係超過九十九個percent嘅訪者咧都係認為依個服務咧係。

127
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:24,520
即係汽車，如果喺一啲大型表演之後啊，或者佢離開西九嘅時候咧，唔需要出翻去原本嗰條誒公路嗰度。咁呢個嘅誒顧運工程咧，係正在咧係開始展開。我哋預計咧係喺今年年尾咧係會有一個方案咧係可以咧係誒睇到咧係嗰個行車嘅路。

128
00:21:45,130 --> 00:22:05,140
誒而西九而家入邊嘅道路咧，基本上咧誒入口嗰一條嘅誒U型嘅車路咧，我哋叫做誒博物館道咧，其實已經係大部分咧係已經誒起好咗㗎啦，亦都開放咗畀公眾。誒我哋咧正在安排咧係誒誒將呢條公幹加嘅馬路咧。

129
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,000
誒，主席就。

130
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,260
連問連答四分鐘先啦，好嘛？咁而家請黃碧雲議員。

131
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,580
噉我所講嘅誒係咁多，將時間交翻畀主席。

132
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,200
最後咧，我哋睇一睇誒一個水路嘅設施咧，就係誒呢個。

133
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,920
翻誒呢個誒展覽館嘅開幕咧，係同步咧係誒去完成。

134
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:40,860
水誒水面登岸嘅設施，咁誒我哋知道咧，運輸處亦都咧係安排咗呢個水上的士咧，係會今年咧係會誒。

135
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:52,860
咁希望咧，將當呢一個嘅誒水路嘅誒登岸點都打通嘅時候咧，就更加方便咧，係可以咧係去到呢個西九文化區。

136
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:48,400
即係授權咧，係誒呢個誒管理局咧，係可以運用相關嘅土地嘅。噉我想問下呢一個批地嘅年期係幾耐啦？呢個第一個問題。

137
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:24,230
誒另外咧，喺當M加博物館誒喺出年開開誒開開放之後咧，地下行車路嘅第一段咧，亦都係開放，就會咧係喺M加博物館嘅誒地下入口嗰方面。

138
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:36,160
關於呢個誒二期嗰邊咧，就我想問一問啦。文件第四段嗰度講咧，就係話政府喺四月二號已經簽咗啲批地文件，咁咧就係受。

139
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:12,650
好誒，多謝政府當局同埋西九管理局。咁而家請各位委員提出問題。噉我諗，因為時間關係，暫時誒，我見到有四位舉手，啊，純屬仲五位在場議。咁而家誒。

140
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:55,940
誒開通嘅，咁咧就會係主要係會連連駁到咧由啟德遊輪碼頭咧駁去尖沙咀啦、西九文化區啦、同埋中環。咁喺誒現時咧，我哋依一個現有嘅登岸點喺大家嘅誒。

141
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:25,410
咁但係咧就誒相關咧，其實我想問咧，就係呢一個發展係咪已經係誒招咗標，係已經揾咗誒發展商去處理咧？係咪一個單一嘅發展商啊？因為係點樣樣咧咁？咁咧就誒。

142
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:16,820
圖中間上邊咧有一個現有嘅登岸點喺呢個誒新嘅油麻地避風塘裏邊，暫時咧係會用呢一個誒，直至到咧我哋呢個南邊嘅登岸點喺M加博物館南邊嘅登岸點都完工咧，就會將呢個碼頭咧就移誒呢個登岸點咧移回翻呢個地方。噉我哋而家嘅。

143
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:36,830
嘅誒顧問嘅誒研究咧已經開始咗啦，我哋都係啱啱開始咗一個月，我哋希望咧係盡快有一個嘅方案，噉啊將呢個嘅登岸嘅碼頭咧可以喺二零二二年咧、二零二二二三年咧係會完工。另外一個登岸點咧，我哋叫做北面嘅登岸點咧，就會係配合翻。

144
00:24:48,840 --> 00:25:08,850
第二咧就係誒，而家咧我哋見到咧政府咧就係關於二B區嗰度咧，你哋就想快啲可以搞嘅，因為嗰度係涉及啲商業嘅項目、酒店、辦公室、住宅噉。咁嗰邊係要誒賺一啲錢嚇，即係嚟養住西金文化區去發展啦。

145
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,310
即係。

146
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,750
嗯。

147
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,960
As Jeremy indicated in the presentation.

148
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,710
好，啊，請秘書長地。

149
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,950
The design requirements for what will be built above the basement, as we design the basement.

150
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:32,190
另外咧就文件第七段咧，我哋比較擔心咧就係二二C咧就好似而家冇著落嘅。

151
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:34,500
咁二B嗰度係咪已經有發展商㗎啦？至於嗰個招標嘅情況，或者我請西九管理局講翻一下。

152
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:27,520
頭先講嘅M家啦，咁跟住有誒故宮博物館啦，仲有一個誒Lyrics就係誒綜誒演藝綜合劇場嘅嚇，呢個應該係二零二四嘅。

153
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:46,570
Of course, because the the area isn't built yet, you can't really tender something out until you've got something to give to them. But what we're doing, of course, is to look at.

154
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:19,600
嘅話咧，公眾睇到咧，除咗M加之外咧，都冇乜料到，即係二師嗰邊誒幾個重要嘅文化藝術設施咧，就好似冇冇冇料期咁喺度等啦。噉我覺得呢度政府應該要交代一下咯。

155
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:46,120
即係我哋就係而家係搞個大地庫，但係意思咧嗰個主要就係西九文化藝術設施、音樂中心、大劇院、誒音樂劇院，而家咧就係冇發展時間表，亦都冇財務模式嘅。

156
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:10,350
所以 at this stage we're focusing on the commercial properties which we can let out because we know what exactly is going in. So we're starting with ACE today. I hope to get sites 31 and 34 which are actually

157
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:37,880
多謝多謝黃議員嘅問題。誒，首先咧就住嗰個批地年期咧係五十年嘅，咁其實係就住行政會議通過咗之後咧，我哋今年嘅較早時間咧已經將嗰個誒資料咧係畀咗誒誒個委員會嘅。

158
00:25:46,400 --> 00:26:06,410
咁即係變咗咧，我哋誒下邊就挖個大地爐，上邊咧冇時間表，咁咧就繼續要嚟做地面做休憩空間。噉我哋真係好大鑊㗎，即係我想問下呢一度係你哋打算拖幾多年先至會去計劃意思上邊嘅誒藝術文化設施咧？如果唔係，

159
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:58,330
第二咧係關於誒第七段嗰度咧，其實呢一個誒頭先講第七段提及嗰啲，譬如包括音樂中心啊、大劇院、音樂劇院呢啲嘅設施咧，其實喺誒嗰個加強財務安排嗰度已經講咗，呢啲係屬於誒第三期嘅一啲誒誒文化藝術設施咧，係一個有機嘅發展，即係話誒當。

160
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:18,340
新港文化區一啲係上面上過嘅啲商業嘅誒誒設施係落成嘅時候咧，佢隨住佢嗰個財政嘅改善咧，佢就會逐步逐步呢啲嘢落成啦。咁喺未來嘅歲月咧，我哋係啦，有三個誒文化藝術嘅設施係會陸續落成，頭有包括你。

161
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,110
嗯，OK，好，下位謝偉全議員。

162
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,310
所以我們有些 preliminary ideas，但係，

163
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,660
望到即係蟹眉毛都白埋啊！

164
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,730
一proper public consultation exercise， which I hope to do later this year.

165
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:59,270
即係我哋唔係好詳細嗰個樣嘢，起碼都有個諗法可以講畀大家聽。

166
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,900
Permanent Secretary indicated, until we have the funding for that, we won't be able to do very much more at this stage.

167
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:13,310
Mr. Chairman, just to say, in fact, we are working on designs. We've done a first round of consultation on the music centre, for example. We did that about a year and a half ago.

168
00:29:52,390 --> 00:30:04,100
都係主席，主席誒，即係誒，我諗即係梗係失望啦。對於二師方面嗰個文化藝術之師啊，包括音樂中心、大劇院、音樂劇院。

169
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:16,500
因為冇計劃咧，即係連嗰個大江嗰個時間表都冇咧，畀人感覺咧就錢啊擺咗咁多落去啦。咁呢方面咧，即係誒。

170
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:23,490
within zone three because that's already being built, tendered out by later this year, and then we'll look at the other areas within zone two as the next phase beyond that.

171
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:32,840
我諗我諗真係請西九管理局咧，真係認真睇一睇呢樣嘢啦。即係因為點解咧？你而家譬如你講二B嗰度啊，你有啲計劃點樣做，創造呢個更大同埋公更具效益嗰個。

172
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:43,810
啊！主席，我聽得唔係好清楚，佢講二B嗰度係咪已經招標完成咗，定係再等啊？仲要二B未未。啊！主席，我我就唔滿意西九個發展進度咯。即係而家我哋搞個大地庫，但係唔係同步度緊上邊嗰度搞乜？

173
00:28:43,810 --> 00:29:03,820
時間表都冇噉啊，真係好大件事咯。即係我希望西九管理局可以盡快交代到。如果連時間表都冇咧，我諗第七嗰段講二C區啲文化藝術設施，都仲要等二B，但係二B都唔知幾時搞得掂。噉你咪真係十年又十年噉，你即係我覺得真係拖得太耐啊。係噉，我諗。

174
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:43,190
as far as the commercial properties again, we have done some preliminary designs. We have got certainly, for example, all of the individual plots identified. The amalgamation, such as it is, to make them more viable, has been done. So the next stage would be again, in accordance with section 19 of our ordinance, to carry out.

175
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:53,130
嗰個嗰個即係模式出嚟咧，咁當然咧呢樣嘢冇人會反對嘅。但係同時咧，你冇理由係對於自己本身，因為你西九文化區啊嘛，文化設施咧嚟緊咧都搞咗咁多年咧，連嗰個誒嗰個計劃嘅時間表啊，同埋財務嘅模式。

176
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:23,230
即係都都未見，即係主席，所以呢樣嘢咧，即係好難接受啦。我認同啦。咁另外咧，其實我想問啊，而家即係西九咧，即係有啲設施陸續完成啦。咁附近咧啲交通網絡，包括行人接駁，我頭先講過啦，即係都慢慢做緊。有冇評估到咧喺呢方面咧對？

177
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,040
係啊，畀啲錢。

178
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,710
誒西九管理局咧，同埋。

179
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,030
主席，誒或者就住交通嚟講啦，其實誒誒。

180
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,600
嗰個管理方面咧，嗰個職責嘅問題嘅分分配係點？

181
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,330
主席，呢啲我哋做工程知㗎，你用個D day咪得咯，即係噉你話即係個時間唔清楚幾多年 plus。

182
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:31,830
呢啲實有㗎嘛，即係即係我唔明啦，即係你等樣樣做好，然後先先咩完全冇計劃。噉你就喺交通嗰度。

183
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:35,400
講個問題，我哋想知道計劃啫，即係個時間表喺度咪得咯。即係你你畀人知道話，原來要二十年先做完嘅喎，噉樣起碼都黐啊！

184
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:58,000
師咧有冇評估到？頭先有講到咧，即係一路睇緊，我相信你睇緊咧，即係點樣做可以令到嗰個交通咧喺附近，尤其是影響咧減到最低呢樣嘢，我想一間可以畀意見。另外咧，我都想問下咧。

185
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:17,230
有啲誒發展咧個酒店、辦公室、住宅咧，因為日後嗰個綜合地庫咧造成咧，我之前都問過啦，有冇諗過即係將來咧嗰個誒，即係呢啲私人發展項目咧，就呢個綜合誒誒呢個個地庫。

186
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:43,240
嗰個交通方面咧，係誒當西九所有啲設施完成，同埋而家一路做緊嘅時候咧，誒嗰個情況咧，邊個情況會好啲咧？係咪將來起好曬先會好啲咧？因為而家而家會好啲，因為冇咁多即係交通喺度咧，噉樣又冇嗰啲商業設。

187
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:45,870
誒主席，首先我想講講咧，誒其實如果大家睇，我都唔知叫第幾版喺topside planning嗰個圖嗰個圖咧，上蓋計劃合併嗰度咧，大家會見到咧係有唔同嘅顏色去見到第一批、第二批同埋餘下嘅。咁呢一個咧，其實當初即係成個構思嘅時候咧，係嗰二把。

188
00:32:45,870 --> 00:33:05,880
十六億咧，係其實主要係做第一同埋第二批大部分嘅。咁喺餘下嗰啲咧，即係頭先我講嘅第三批咧，確實咧係當初都係諗住係話，當誒上個嘅誒上個嘅一啲誒物業咧係做咗之後咧，係隨住西九嘅財政係改善咗咧，噉佢先做第三批嘅。咁所以絕對我。

189
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:25,890
覺得而家即係話西九係延遲咗咧，就未必係咁公平嘅。咁誒，至於講到係話誒個交通嗰個誒誒影響咧，其實嗰陣時我哋喺個誒大綱圖出咗之後咧，其實係有請個運輸署咧係做過交通評估噉樣。請我請阿阿應女士去詳細咁講。誒，主席，頭先就秘書長講。

190
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:56,570
誒，但係多謝多謝議員。誒，其實點解我哋現階段講唔到？因為其實頭先已經講咗，就係因為等佢上蓋發展啦。咁但係知道咧，上蓋發展其實大部分就喺誒嗰個中，即係個第二期嗰度。咁啱啱其實嗰個綜合地庫咧，其實喺舊年嘅六月已經係過咗個誒同誒。

191
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:16,580
過咗PWSC啦，咁今年F.C.線就批咗，咁個地庫未做好咧，咁其實西九咧就唔可以做上蓋咯。咁所以變咗咧，我諗而家誒有咗嗰個地庫嘅批款之後咧，噉我諗我哋係會交位，有一個基礎去估咯嚇。咁到到目前為止咧，即係希望大家明白，因為上個月先至係通過咗。

192
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,870
區。

193
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,120
個咧就。

194
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,270
好誒，下一位係劉國芬議員。

195
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,860
依個誒誒區域裏邊嗰個交通嘅狀狀況嘅。

196
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,810
咧就能夠咧就貫貫穿到誒，譬如好似誒呢條誒。

197
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,530
問題就問現有嘅設施，包括戲曲中心會唔會都減租咧？

198
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:57,710
運輸署咧喺誒零七年左右嘅時間咧，係曾經就住西九龍呢個填海區咧，係進進行過一個整體性嘅嘅交通評估嘅。咁亦都誒評估過啦，就即係高鐵誒誒高鐵上蓋嘅建築物啦，西九文化區嘅嘅嘅興建咧，係對嗰個誒周遭嘅交通影響。

199
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:17,720
咧係做咗個評估嘅，咁亦都而家嘅文化區嗰個嘅嘅發展咧，亦都係就住，亦都有吸納到呢個交通評估所作出嚟嘅建議嘅。咁其實咧喺廣東度嚟講咧，就先後有三個嘅路口咧，亦都已經進行咗一個誒路口嘅改建工程啦。咁而喺誒蓮祥道啊、亞長道啊，或者啱啱誒。

200
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:37,730
管理局有介紹過一啲嘅新嘅出出口點咧，都能夠咧大大改善到誒西九文化區同誒誒香港其他地區嘅接駁嘅。咁當誒誒地庫下低嗰條誒地下行車通道能夠誒整體完成咗，大概喺二零二七年、二八年依個光景嗰時咧，其實依條地下通道咧。

201
00:35:42,090 --> 00:36:02,100
西邊嗰個新嘅出口點啦，誒連連長道啦，同埋如果將來嚟講咧都可以，如果消防局可以走讀誒搬搬遷到嘅話咧，都可以博到係廣東道嘅。咁整體嚟講咧，依條地下通道連連及西九龍區附近嘅一一係列嘅道路改善工程咧，係能夠整體地咧係改善到西九龍。

202
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:32,220
噉啊，西九咧就一環扣一環嘅。咁基本上我哋都知道就係即係嗰個二B又要地攤整好之後先可以發展啲商業。咁跟住嗰啲即係藝術，即係最後尾嗰啲中心啊、音樂嗰啲，又係要等商業營運完之後先搞掂。咁但係最後尾嗰塊拼圖，終於都畀咗你哋。

203
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:52,230
啊！咁地庫嗰啲錢都攞曬啦，咁理論上都即係基本上都條件齊備啦。噉我都想問，即係西九嗰度噉，而家係咪都係因為你已經所有唔明確嘅嘢都應該啊清咗曬啦。咁地庫又攞埋錢去做啦。咁有冇一個指標話畀我哋聽啊？究竟意思？

204
00:36:53,150 --> 00:37:13,160
咁誒，你話當個財政改善咗之後咧，就會做二C嗰啲即係藝術設施啦。咁但係個問題就係嗱，當二B可能佢誒用個財務形式可能誒啲發展商投標，其實已經有一筆錢啦。究竟係攞到個筆錢嘅時候就可以開展二C啊，還是係等？

205
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:33,390
二B投咗標之後，要營運一段時間先可以開展二C嗰啲藝術中心啊、音樂中心嗰啲工程咧，咁有冇一個指標可以明確啲，即係啊，畀我哋瞭解下究竟點樣先係一個改善，跟住就去興建第三期設施。咁呢個係第一個問題。第二個問題咧，都睇到。

206
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:54,410
我哋講翻現有嘅設施先，頭先都講咗即係現有嘅設施啦。咁誒，即係大家都知道疫情影響之後，好多文化藝術啊，包括粵劇團都受到影響。噉就算即係誒疫情過去之後，我相信嗰啲粵劇團嗰個發展都係艱難嘅。咁都有報道講到話，而家誒。

207
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,190
嗯。

208
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,540
That。

209
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,730
for the area.

210
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,160
In phases where we'll start the physical construction.

211
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,630
係啊，李司長。誒，主席，我答幾句，然後就交畀啊啊。

212
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:34,190
25,26會係The topside for the H.O.R. elements and thereafter will be the remaining. So there is a timetable within the paper to indicate the basement development.

213
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:14,910
gives us time to do the planning for the top side, both the commercial elements and the non-commercial, the cultural and the artistic elements. So if you look at paragraph eleven, we're talking two thousand and twenty-five.

214
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:38,860
呢一度咧，亦都明白，即係呢個一個好大動作，亦都由於噉嘅原因，所以我哋以往喺四月底會同大家講西九財務嘅狀況，都要褪到去六月。咁所以希望大家明白，我哋需要啲時間做嘅喺個方面。咁主戲曲中心嘅收費，我交畀阿柏志高先生。

215
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:51,120
In terms of the question about Chinese opera, Cantonese opera, in fact, we already have an arrangement for discounted rates for Cantonese opera use of the Tsui Chu Centre. Those discounts are up to fifty percent.

216
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:59,140
I think the key answer to your question is actually already in the paper in paragraphs eleven, twelve and thirteen, where we explain that we've adopted a phased approach to the delivery of the basement part of the project. Because of course you can't build anything without the basement.

217
00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:14,420
啊！粵曲戲曲中心嗰個收費都係偏貴嘅。咁喺未有疫情之下都覺得貴嘅時候，咁疫情過去要扶持翻啲劇團或者粵劇要發展嘅時候，噉我想問，即係西九會唔會都有個諗法，就係即係減租，即係一來係去即係。

218
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:34,430
幫助減輕佢哋負擔啦。二來劇情喺疫情之後，我相信即係好多即係劇團啊、藝術文化人士都希望可以盡快有啲公開下嘅。咁變咗你減租嘅時候，可以推動多啲即係粵劇咧，係可能演出啊等等，咁都係一個幫助。咁所以想即係第二。

219
00:38:44,190 --> 00:39:04,200
阿柏志高先生，誒，首先咧喺嗰度，大家再問係意意思嗰個誒時間表啦。噉我講咧，其實係根據加強財務安排咧，喺二零二二二三年咧，其實西九已經要諗一個係融資嘅安排嘅。咁大家記得，大家我諗大家知道咧，佢發展誒第二期嘅上蓋。

220
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:24,210
嘅商業嘅模式咧，係通過佢叫BOT，即係build、operate and transfer，即係營運、誒誒誒建設、營運，然後轉交嘅。咁但係咧呢一個就好視乎佢tender嘅時候咧嗰個誒經濟嘅狀況。其實係由於舊年嘅社會事件同埋今年嘅疫情咧，其實盤數由頭睇過嘅。咁所以

221
00:40:51,400 --> 00:41:11,410
We do work with them. In fact, we work with the local troops to commission work, so we're actually paying them to do the work. So we're doing a number of initiatives to try and support the that particular art form because it is so important that we do so in a proactive manner.

222
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:33,070
Obviously, the biggest issue at the moment is that all of these theatres are closed. You know, it doesn't matter if it's LCSD ourselves or the private theatres. So what we've been trying to do is to work with the people who had previously booked the facilities for shows to try and reschedule those shows. We're not charging extra for that reschedule.

223
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,840
係。

224
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,930
only resolved by a court case in the end.

225
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,980
所以那給你一個時間表。

226
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,630
practice the the the point about being honest. I'm always honest.

227
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:08,670
Report that back to to members in due course. The 300 million is a is an important contribution to that, but it's not the full amount.

228
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:41,520
就係佢都好坦白嘅，就話啦，有一個額外費用嘅。咁但係咧，就睇嚟而家係咪呢一刻係匯報唔到定係點咧？都係當然等你六月個財務報告先知道啊。

229
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:53,080
we're we're sticking to the commitments that we have because obviously we realise that this is a long-term partnership-building exercise. It's not just a one-off exercise, so rest assured, we will try and work very closely with the industry as we move forward.好，問下，可唔可以短期畀多啲優惠佢哋咧？好，誒，下一位，礦俊宇議員。

230
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:13,670
主席，誒，我哋而家睇緊咧就西九文化區個二區最新發展，噉啊，之前喺呢個小組我都形容過啦，呢個嘅西九文化區嘅項目咧，即係接近呢個係無底黑洞噉嘅樣嘅，即係我哋咧即係金睛火眼要及實啦，即係發生咩事，因為佢係一個洗濕過頭嘅一個典型示範，濕製文化。

231
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:33,680
下區我唔知阿柏志高知唔知咩叫濕滯嘅，即係大概就好鬼麻煩啊！你哋嗰啲嘢之前咧新窗嘅退場，你哋勒令佢離開工地。我知你咧就就住呢件事咧就追翻個擔保公司啊，都叫勝訴啊，攞翻三億到啦。OK，好啦，咁究竟嗰度呢個情況係咪可以抵消到咧？嗱，因為你知道顯身嗰個有。

232
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:53,690
額外費用啊，即係你攞翻三億過嚟，咁其實聽落去好似好筍噉啊，中間左除右拆噉樣，究竟係仲要貼幾多咧？因為你知我追好緊嘅，嗱四月就應該做個財務報表，啱啱啊啊啊處長講就啊，秘書長講話誒嚟緊可能騰到六月噉樣啦，我係擔心嘅，我係好擔心，我一定會。

233
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:13,700
次都要追問，有幾個問題，我次次到問題都要即係問到主席都熟㗎啦。一就係呢度，誒即係嗰個貼幾錢啦，即係究竟你嗰度誒即係攞咗嗰個嘅誒三億翻嚟啦，額外費用除減翻之後貼幾多，使唔使有填氹嘅？又或者係諗住點填啦？其次就係咧，上次都追問過嗰個嘅M家嘅博物。

234
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:33,710
本今年三月本身應該攞咗入火紙嘅，OK咁而家就話可能又疫情又剩啦咁咁幾時先攞到入火紙咧？即係我每次會都追一次追下追下都追到自己唔記得追第幾次啦噉。所以我想聽咗兩個問題先，一就係誒頭先嗰個額外費用誒扣剩幾多？其次就係嗰個嘅M。

235
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:53,720
間幾時攞入夥紙？多謝主席，係李書長，阿白志高先生。Yeah, um, Mr. Chairman, let's let me deal with the easy one. The occupation permit we expect in July, because there's obviously been a three-month delay that that just carries forward. But I must say, and I want to express my thanks to the government departments, they have been working.

236
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:13,730
working very closely with us, we've had some initial inspections by fire services. For example, they've gone very well so far, so the progress is reasonably good. So we're looking forward to getting the op, and of course following op, it then takes nine to twelve months to get the museum and estate.

237
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:37,270
In terms of the zone two development, I should clarify that the the money that we received recently was an on demand bond. It was paid out by their their insurance company, not by the Sinchong themselves. This was a bond which we called in fact over a year ago, and was.

238
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,580
熟創業。

239
00:49:51,210 --> 00:50:10,030
面嘅登岸設施啊，或者嗰個誒同嗰個故宮嗰個連接嗰個會係點樣咧？咁同埋誒同即係故宮嘅開放時間，因為誒我冇記錯就係二零二二年七月嘅，即係我哋回歸二十五週年嘅時候想開嘅。咁另外最後一條咧就應該係。

240
00:44:40,210 --> 00:45:00,220
And there is still a right of appeal, obviously under the system here. We don't have the final cost for the project for obvious reasons, because we don't know yet what the final cost will be. But I can assure you, yes, we will have to put additional funding into that, and that will be obviously very transparent, and we will.

241
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:31,130
主席，嗱，誒問題又好簡單嘅，因為咧，哦唔知柏志高呢次答我係咪仲有一次啊？七月啦，嗱，我上次問咧就三月嘅，今次就七月嘅，噉係咪可以肯定？首先，第一會唔會又延期啦？我唔知道啦，陣間即係賴完嗰個天又賴地硬噉樣啦。咁第二就係咧頭先所提咧。

242
00:45:43,190 --> 00:46:03,200
Yes, Mr. Chairman. The accounts are finished at what we call one year after practical completion, when we we finalise those accounts. That's the normal practice in the industry in Hong Kong, and that at that point we'll be able to do the reconciliation. That's just the way the accounts are done. I'm afraid we we have to follow the

243
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:29,670
主席，我希望每一次唔係我係即係我，主席我唔係希望每一次都嚟追數或者追個博物館啊，真係陰公。我而家好似入七年呢個小組就係追數噉樣。我希望柏志高先生你唔好誤會，但係問題就係我嘅職責就係要追你，因為真係我真係驚又又使我哋啲錢嚟填淡，或者個博物館又唔知去咗邊咁解嘅啫。唔該，主席。明白。好，下一位係阿陳。

244
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:51,120
我諗啊，抗議完真係要有排追。我我我我就已經係倒數會議㗎啦。咁呢次咧，應該我係參加尾議嗰次，咁所以咧有啲嘢咧我就要追定或者問定。咁可能以後要靠其他議員追啦。噉啊，包括咧我枱面咧就啊擺咗一封信咧，就係關於誒過去即係。

245
00:46:51,120 --> 00:47:11,130
撥咗款或者有其他唔同嘅撥款之後咧，我希望誒誒政府當局咧可以交一個咧，我我同事炒嘅呢個叫金突金突圖啊。咁咧其實咧就誒，我首先誒我我哋已經收到回覆係會做，不過有啲時間咯。我我多謝啦嚇，因為可能都要誒頗長嘅時間，因為唔同嘅工程有唔同嘅階段，噉我。

246
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:31,140
希望有一條誒時間線，可以等大家睇得到嗰個月係應該大概做到啲咩地步嘅。咁呢一個等誒以後啲議員可以方便啲即係跟進。咁跟住咧我就一係列嘅問題嘅。咁咧就誒首先咧第一咧就係關於翻咧誒一陣間就A C E啦，我我嗰度會再問啊。

247
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:51,150
咁但係咧，誒誒頭先阿阿阿柏志高先生就有提到咧，係咪今年年尾？我唔知有冇聽錯，係咪今年年尾要去一次呢一個誒誒城規會？誒我係咪聽係咪誒誒誤會錯咗？咁但係如果唔係嘅話咧，就就住誒誒話文件嗰度咧有提到咧就。

248
00:47:51,150 --> 00:48:11,160
有條天橋咧，行人天橋將要起嘅就係第二十七段咁嗰度誒會係點？因為當時咧個嗰個誒西九文化區個Osetp咧分區計劃大綱圖係咪喺嗰度咧就有要求到誒誒貴局要起一條誒誒誒行人天橋去連接呢個西九同埋九龍公園噉。

249
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:31,170
究竟會唔會做係咪唔做？又要有啲手續咧。咁第二咧就係關於噉，但係我又聽到好似話年尾要做一個public consultation嘅。頭先有講個公眾諮詢，噉我想了解下係咩性質，關於啲咩議題。咁第二條咧就係關於頭先有講到咧，就誒而家嗰個見到個地庫咧，即係個清水個地庫咧。

250
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,470
譚先生可以答，答覆問題。

251
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:44,650
You know, taken on board the issues that have happened at Zone Three and the Lyric Theatre.

252
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:37,850
for that zone 2A area, so we certainly have.

253
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:47,020
誒招標嘅工作㗎啦，就希望我就可以遴選到一個顧問幫我哋作出一個研究個走線嗰方面。如果我哋有進一步嘅資料咧，都會翻嚟呢度誒彙報嘅。多謝主席，唔該曬，唔好意思。OK，唔該。誒，下一位啊，黃碧雲議員第二輪。

254
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:51,180
咁遲啲就要將啲slab咧就要誒誒拆走佢嘅。噉我就想問下，即係有啲咩工有啲咩方法去確保到個工程嘅安全性？因為之前誒大家都知道係好似喺個劇院嗰度定係邊個地盤係啦，嗰個綜合劇場嗰度咧就發生即係一個疑似水浸滲水嘅情況。咁誒，希望嗰度可以。

255
00:48:51,180 --> 00:49:11,190
解釋一下啦，咁跟住另外咧就誒，關於其實係睇到有啲唔同咗嘅，因為尤其是嗰個合併嗰個圖嗰度咧，將呢個二B同埋二C咧，以往咧係好乾淨就噉樣切咗落去嘅，但係而家你見到咧個地庫咧係滲咗入去二B誒二C嗰度嘅，咁嗰度我諗相信就係因為攞。

256
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:31,200
撥款之後，可能有個新嘅設計，而導致到令到佢哋嗰個設計有變化，可能令到之後嘅無論文化設施定係上邊嘅誒嗰啲誒誒嗰啲誒誒商業誒設施啊，都可以誒方便啲去安排啦。咁誒呢一個係見得到嘅。咁誒，我暫時有。

257
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:51,210
兩個問題先，因為我稍後A.C.E.嗰度我仲有嘢問，唔該曬啊。另外係唔好意思，誒，關於好多嗰啲連期配合嗰啲交通接駁咧，誒誒，雖然即係我當然即係故宮啊，我嘅立場大家都知道，故宮博物館噉，但係誒誒，根據嗰個北。

258
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:31,010
係主席，唔好意思，喺台度誒嗰個無人嗰個無人車咧，同誒運輸署傾成點樣？因為嗰架車仔咧，如果冇記錯，就係嗰架頭先講嘅智能啦。咁咧嗰架係無人駕駛嘅車嚟嘅。噉我雖然我冇錯過噉，但係我想了解下究竟誒而家同運輸署嘅跟進情況係點？正如頭先所講，係咪真係可以同誒？

259
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:51,020
當當時如果喺誒路面行車嘅車嗰個要互相配合，唔好意思啊，主席。係啊，Chairman. There's quite a few questions there. I'll try and answer very succinctly. The autonomous vehicle, obviously, we've worked very closely with the Transport Department, and in fact, we continue to do so as we extend the range.

260
00:50:51,020 --> 00:51:11,030
of that vehicle, as we change the routing, we obviously keep transport department informed. I would remind members that the intention of the autonomous vehicle is as a trial to look at a way to provide in district transportation in future. This is one option. Whether or not it is the final option will of course depend on

261
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:31,040
The development of such machines and other alternatives as we go forward, but that is underway. In terms of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, I think your question was about connectivity to the landing steps. Yes. The the issue there is that the landing steps, as far as

262
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:51,050
The Artis Square Bridge obviously come into the Artis Square. There will be the what we call the extension of the avenue, which takes people round to the Hong Kong Palace Museum in future, using Museum Drive as the routing. But that is all being planned in.

263
00:51:51,050 --> 00:52:11,060
And in due course, when the ACE project is developed, and we'll answer more questions on that later, that will form part of the connectivity under under cover to provide a covered walkway. In terms of the public consultation, my reference there was to the requirements as we take forward any project.

264
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:31,070
In this district, we do carry out public consultation, so we will be carrying out further public consultation. In terms of the question about changes to the zone two basement, the only real point there is that the zone two basement has always covered zone two C.

265
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:51,120
Zone 2B and Zone 2A, as well as Zone 3 etc. It is a comprehensive basement structure that covers throughout, hence the term integrated basement. What we've been doing really is looking at how to develop that integrated basement to allow for the above ground development, and that is essentially what

266
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,640
係。

267
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:18,730
四通八達都可以過到嚟西九文化區，我想問一問政府會唔會計劃做呢一樣嘢？

268
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:13,800
進化有嗰個具體方案啦，噉就誒，另外咧就係關於嗰個誒。

269
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:34,480
應該都要考慮嘅，即係話除咗佢係作為一個貨物嘅，即係誒裝卸區，噉係咪行人都可以同步係安全地有一啲通道畀佢可以行過嚟嘅咧？咁？

270
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:50,920
啊，噉就分呢個文化藝術設施啊、酒店辦公室住宅啊、零售餐飲消閒啊、跟住社區誒用途啊等等，即係GIC啦。噉我就想問下，其實你哋係咪即係整體已經計過嗰個行車嗰啲需要？嗱，因為主席，我就突然之間喺度諗啦。

271
00:52:51,120 --> 00:53:11,130
We'll be looking at going forward. I think the final point is your request in your letter, which I have received. We will of course give you the details in the format that you want. But if you if you refer to the plan which is attached, it actually sets out more or less the timetable. But we'll give you that in the format that you want separately.

272
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:31,140
Jeremy, if you just want to ask the last question, sure. Just to respond to your questions on I think construction safety and the leaking that was occurred in the Zone Three area. I mean, certainly we've always said and we still maintain that safety is obviously the top priority of West Kowloon.

273
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:51,150
And we'd like to reiterate that all of the construction works are under the statutory approval and monitoring procedures of the Buildings Department and other statutory authorities, and we follow that extremely closely with the team that's required under those statutory requirements.

274
00:53:51,150 --> 00:54:11,160
Since the leakage incident at the Lyric Theatre, we have put in place for this next contract, which is in Zone 2A, a number of enhancement measures, and that includes, for example, having what we call a grouting team on 24 hours.

275
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:31,170
Standby. You may recall in the zone three area, the the incident happened at about one o'clock in the morning. So we've put that in place. But we also have a what we call an enhanced detail for the cofferdam. We've got quite a comprehensive what we call clutched pipe pile design.

276
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:13,510
咧，我哋喺東面咧，就希望咧連接呢個誒九龍公園啦，同埋呢個中港客運碼頭嗰條行人天橋咧。其實喺規劃大綱圖裏邊咧，嗰個誒發展圖則咧，亦都有標示到嘅。但係當然啦，我哋都有解釋過咧，因為咧誒消防局嘅搬遷係比較困難嘅，所以我哋都希望咧就展開一個研。

277
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:33,520
夠響消防局唔搬遷嘅情況底下，我哋可唔可以改一改嗰個誒我哋當初規劃嘅走線，而令到咧嗰一邊東面嘅接駁咧，以致去到九龍公園，甚至係去到誒尖沙咀嗰嗰區域咧，都能夠有一個更好嘅接駁。所以咧，我哋都已經咧就進行緊一個。

278
00:55:47,340 --> 00:56:07,350
誒主席，我想問一問咧，就關於嗰個行人連接嗰度，噉啊第廿七段，咁當然誒，我係非常之歡迎政府咧，盡快咧係研究咧，就係博通九龍公園同埋西九文化區嗰邊嘅，噉就究竟係走地下定係地面定係路面可以過到咧？噉我希望。

279
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:34,090
行人連接咧，文件就完全冇提到誒由大角咀或者奧運嗰邊誒奧運嘅四小龍嗰邊係咪可以駁到過嚟西九文化區咧？咁咁當然我哋知道咧，隔離咧即係誒中間咧就係斷咗，即係嗰個海濱嗰個行人嘅連接。

280
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:54,100
係因為誒新油麻地公眾貨物裝卸區，噉佢哋咧就係冇提供任何嘅行人嘅通道嘅。噉我想問一問咧，就西九管理局同埋政府會唔會都同誒新油麻地公眾貨物裝卸區嗰邊嘅負責人，即係傾一傾，有冇可能研究？

281
00:56:54,100 --> 00:57:14,110
夠咧，就係可以誒，令到啊奧運四小龍嗰邊，甚至大個嘴都可以透過呢個海邊，係有得行人連接過到嚟呢個西九文化區咧。咁咁因為第日嗰邊咧都係會有誒呢個水上的士啦。咁噉我哋誒當然亦都希望啲即係。

282
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,950
劇場 under construction.

283
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,800
個時間將會幾時完成？

284
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,510
就將A、B、C。

285
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:18,390
好，誒，下一位係何君瑤議員第一輪。

286
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:55,240
as part and parcel of the of the development and design phase.

287
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:55,070
以A、B、C，我哋自己本身西九發展嘅嗰幾個重點項目。

288
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:06,380
噉啊，列出嚟喺文字裏邊有嘅，其實整一張大圖咧，就將A、B、C跟住啊三A、三B呢啲咧。

289
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:16,710
誒勾畫出嚟喺屬於我哋WKCDA嘅area裏邊，嗰幾個大嘅項目，我而家已經見到Nurik。

290
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:29,340
啊，主席啊，我就誒以前我都有跟得比較貼啲，不過最近又少冇咁咁貼，係睇呢一個。

291
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:45,440
西九嘅文化發展個計劃，可唔可以咧？其實都方便啲議員咧，都可以誒，即係追得貼啲，同埋思前想後咧，方便咧睇得到嗰個進展。誒誒，有個大嘅宏觀圖，好似而家噉樣。

292
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:42,320
多謝主席，誒多謝啊議員嘅跟進。就住我哋西九文化區呢個規劃咧，其實現時咧我哋嗰度要做嘅接駁咧都顯示咗出嚟嘅。噉我哋咧就誒喺我哋嘅規劃裏邊咧就冇依個計劃係會再有其他嘅接駁嘅系統啦。不過就住啊議員嘅意見咧，我哋可能會搦翻去同運輸署再誒跟進，睇下佢哋有啲咩。

293
00:57:42,320 --> 00:58:02,330
嘅計劃，多謝主席。係啦，儘量儘量考慮下啦嚇。係咯，即係即係嗰個誒係咪係咪不可能先？即係要研究一下，即係係咪需要同需唔需要同海事處嗰邊傾啊？抑或係即係關於嗰個誒貨物裝卸區嗰邊，即係究竟佢哋之前畀佢使用。

294
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:22,340
嘅時候有冇提出要求話應該係有行人可以誒通道嘅咧？咁如果之前冇講清楚，而家有冇機會可以誒提出呢一個嘅要求咧？咁噉我哋可以令到整個海濱嗰個行人嘅連接誒系統，甚至呢個都係誒海濱嗰個發展嘅計劃誒。

295
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:54,770
係啦，睇下得唔得啦，係嘛？當局係嘛？考慮下先。我哋會同運輸處再睇睇有啲乜可以做。係，多謝。好唔該，係誒下一位誒陳淑莊議員第二輪。唔好意思啊，主席。第一咧，我就想問下咧誒，下次會唔會可以啲圖咧？因為我我哋都追咗好多，即即嗰啲年我唔係嗰啲圖，我哋跟咗好多年。我就想問下，因為頭先個話誒投影片都有嗰啲。

296
00:58:54,770 --> 00:59:14,780
shaft啊，即係有嗰啲嗰啲通風井啊，嗰啲關於高鐵嗰啲咧，睇有冇機會喺翻誒誒相關嘅嗰個地域嗰度可以放翻喺度，等大家可以瞭解下佢嗰個佈局會誒對嗰個關於商業嗰個誒商業設施嗰個影響會有幾多啦。咁同埋誒誒呢個。

297
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:34,790
個遲啲可能啲同事再跟啦，有機會即係可能對嗰個打樁嗰個有冇咩影響啊？上面可以起到有幾高啊？咁咁不過咧，相關嘅一個誒誒引致嘅問題咧，我就想了解下，因為誒西九就即係嗰陣時有個誒分區計劃大綱圖啦，噉就有曬嗰啲發展參數。

298
00:59:51,390 --> 01:00:11,400
地底條路就即係條路，本來喺路面就搬咗落地底噉啊！地底又連接好多嘢㗎，停車場啊、哐啷嗰啲嘢啊，得有關商業事、有關藝術事事噉，當然有路走啦。咁但係路面唔塞車，可以地下塞車㗎嘛？地底塞車咁會唔會其實誒？究竟啲路夠唔夠咧？即係。

299
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:31,410
我我有啲擔心，因為你泊車位又好似好多喎，咁誒誒條路又好似狹窄，我諗唔係話你話彈性，你喐得就喐得嘅喎。咁究竟誒裡面條路，你哋預計會唔會變成好塞車噉樣咧？即係我都想問一問。好，誒，Thank you. A few things on the the ventilation shafts.

300
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:51,420
Another obstacles, yes, we can we can show them on the map. But I would say that the the design parameters are for them to be embedded within the the buildings to be built in future, so they they become part of the pre-existing fabric. It's just very similar to the pre-existing facilities that we have in the in the site, like ventilation shafts for the MTR.

301
01:00:51,420 --> 01:01:11,430
R C. They're integrated within the park areas. We have intake for all of those big buildings behind us. I A C C and elements that go through the sites. They all have to be integrated. So the same logic applies for all of these obstacles. In terms of the

302
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:38,980
Forster and Partner，二零一一年已經同我哋整一個噉嘅。

303
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,170
就畀議員知得到由Alan Foster。

304
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:30,580
噉我即係想畀大家咧，即係起碼有個master plan同埋timetable咧。

305
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:25,490
我會lost track咗，我要花好長時間去追蹤翻曬之前講乜嘢，同埋而家我哋嘅進度去到邊度？可唔可以整個master plan出嚟畀大家睇睇咧？啊，總裁可唔可以？

306
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:31,330
M plus museum under constructions，大概呢個都屬於係都好快會完成啦，因為已經做咗噉。你你呢個就屬於喺three A下邊嗰堆嘅area噉。

307
01:03:51,840 --> 01:04:05,380
計埋上面啲誒酒店添，二B咧嗰度有七棟嘢嘅，係屬於係似乎係將會批出去發展畀啲private sector去參加，嗰個就二零二七運作。

308
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:53,570
嗰個叫做概念，到目前我哋已經做緊邊幾個已經差唔多完。如果要做齊曬呢個成個區份裏邊啊，有自己嘅w k c。

309
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:24,870
咁意思咧，有三棟大嘢。我剛才講嗰啲咩music theatre、great theatre同埋music誒centre嗰啲咧，就冇個時間話畀我哋聽幾時完成。只不過就二零二零尾咧，我哋就會做好啲設計啦。但幾時要做好，仲未知，因為嗰個財嗰個財務安排啊，都唔係好清楚。

310
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:31,440
The development plan. We don't have a NZP. We have a development plan which sets out the requirements for the site. We did carry out traffic studies to look at not only the impact on the area surrounding, but also the traffic within the district. And the the traffic consultants, transport consultants, are

311
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:51,450
Still engaged in that process. So, for example, as we develop the two A, two B, two C plans, they are engaged to ensure that the traffic is addressed. So, access points, exit points, parking arrangements. For example, very important issue for the district is coach parking. So we're looking at these areas.

312
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:15,530
You quite rightly mentioned car parking, and it's important to note that we also have to comply with the statutory requirements in terms of car park spaces for be it offices, hotels, residential. So all of that is fully compliant within the development plan. Okay, thank you. Okay.

313
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:51,620
至於二B二C嗰度咧，C嗰度比較複雜啲，因為仲有幾幾棟嘢music centre誒誒，仲有great centre同埋musical theatre呢啲咧就冇時間表表我哋話幾時完成，所以簡單講句咧，我睇到二A咧，希望喺二零二六就投投入運作。

314
01:04:53,850 --> 01:05:13,860
D.A.嘅嗰個嗰啲facilities之外咧，仲有其他private sector嗰啲入嚟嘅。咁嗱，即係成個噉嘅計劃，我哋會幾時完成？好啦，我哋自己嗰度花幾多錢？你已經花幾百億已經揼咗落去啦。我哋知道啦，亦都有佔咗有成三十六萬平方米嘅面積。我哋發展將來，我哋又點樣做？咁呢個我已經知道。

315
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:33,930
但係你又點預計得到private sector仲有成成二十幾棟啊？嗰啲酒店都未見外型添咧，未見批。咁噉，但係我哋已經有喺二A二B咧，又預計到二零二六或者二零二七年係投入。點解我又會咁老定？人哋private sector嗰啲咧又覺得咁老定，佢有帶資嚟嚟興建又。

316
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:53,940
搞得掂，但係自己香港呢一度呢呢個西九嘅文文文化中心呢一度咧，實際上政府嘢嚟啫嘛。不過就畀咗個獨立嘅噉嘅嘅嘅局嚟去發展，啲錢咧就反而咧好似覺得捉襟見肘。有啲嘢講到喺意意思裏邊嘅嗰個嗰個Great誒誒Great。

317
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:42,460
好啊，好啊，代表司長。

318
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,920
係，係。

319
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,700
我會defer to William if he can.

320
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:42,980
until we know how much we get from those sites, it's very difficult to commit to further.

321
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:10,670
clearing the way by providing that money to allow us to now move forward, but it does take time. The basement itself will be what five years.

322
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:19,440
個討論時間我都差唔多啦，咁多謝相關嘅政府當局官員同埋西九管理局嘅。

323
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:32,590
噉我想請誒管理局方面咧，係用個投影嘅形式咧，係介紹一下誒個A C E嘅組合更詳細嘅內容。

324
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:35,950
those sites that exist primarily into B and part of 2A for the commercial uses.

325
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:31,930
咁跟住落嚟咧，就係議程嘅第五項，西九文化區A發展組合嘅最新進展。請相關嘅局方人員同埋文化局嘅代表進場。

326
01:05:53,940 --> 01:06:13,950
啊，同埋呢個music centre同埋musical theatre，反而都唔夠膽講得實拿實指。但係人哋private sector嗰啲，我預計埋佢會有錢嚟完成埋。即係我我即係平衡唔到嗰個心態。點解奪人哋嗰啲就奪得咁清楚，奪自己嗰啲咧就好似冇乜把握。咁所以有陣時我睇睇下嘅時候。

327
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:46,140
The very first meeting of this session, we did provide that information, which I can provide again for you in a paper which sets out the overview of the project as it is today and going forward. And indeed, as the other honourable members asked us for, a plans which will set out the known timetables such.

328
01:06:46,140 --> 01:07:06,150
such as they are. So we will provide that separately. You mentioned a number of different issues, and one question you asked is how much have we actually built so far? Well, in broad terms, in GFA terms, we what is under construction or already open represents about 25% of the GFA of the site. Because of course, as you

329
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:26,160
可以見從The Plan，The vast majority of the site is actually within the two A to B to C area. In terms of the the financial arrangements, of course, as as the permanent secretary said earlier, we are reliant from now on on income that comes from the disposal.

330
01:07:43,260 --> 01:08:03,270
costs for the the rest of the site, but that doesn't stop us trying to plan ahead so that when we're ready, when we know that money, we can then activate quite quickly. But let me stress the key for all of this has always been and remains the basement, because without the basement we can do nothing. So that that is why we're so grateful for members.

331
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:30,960
五 years just to to get to the point where we can start to use it. So we do have that time yet。嗯，主席，我講多句嘢。誒，我相信即係我坐喺呢個委員會裏邊咧，我就唔會話刻意去阻攔嘅。我相信亦都冇人會，只不過大家咧要睇下嗰個使費咧就唔好超出咁解。個basement有。

332
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:50,970
需要愛乜嘢資源去完成咧？呢個好重要，因為冇咗basement咧，你到上邊嘅infrastructure咧，superstructure起唔到嘅。冇infrastructure冇superstructure起唔到，所以呢個亦都係邏輯上亦都唔會阻。只不過咧，有陣時我哋會lost track。不過多謝阿柏志高先生話，第一個meeting我哋已經有個plan。我諗咧，即係方便我哋大家睇嘅時候。

333
01:08:50,970 --> 01:09:10,980
咧每次都有一個plan畀我哋睇翻嗰個咧，就會可以解釋得到嗰件事嘅進度。呢一個會事半功倍，方便我哋監察嘅時候係咪真係有啲嘢係係刻意或者人為性墮後嘅？誒，即係墮即係墮後咗嘅。噉我哋可以補翻個時間咁計。好多謝誒呢個項。

334
01:09:43,500 --> 01:10:03,510
誒畀多個麥畀書長。係誒藝術商業展覽發展組合，就簡單講ACE啦，係管理局喺西九文化區推出嘅第一個建造營運同埋移交嘅項目。噉就喺文化區嘅西邊嘅，噉就係靠近落成咗嘅藝術公園同埋自由空間，同埋而家正在興建嘅。

335
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,510
係。

336
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,110
唔係。

337
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,380
係。

338
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,530
Just speak.

339
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,750
我而家嚟報告一下誒。

340
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,940
我哋會爭取喺年底之前咧，希望能夠定到標。

341

睇啲生字，係請請啲。

343
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,560
A.C.E嘅發展係分咗誒嘅投標嘅，係分咗兩個階段嘅。

344
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:06,300
西九文化區A.C.E所謂即係藝術商業展覽項目嘅最新嘅進展。

345
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:37,510
啊，A C E嘅項目咧嚇係採用啊B O T，即係建造營運同埋移交嘅模式進行。

346
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:45,100
希望咧能夠藉助市場喺設計、營建造同埋管理營運嘅能力嘅資源嚟發展呢個項目。

347
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:56,230
A.C.E項目佔地咧係五點五平誒公頃，係即係就係等於西九文化區三十八點六五公頃裏邊嘅，大概十四嘅percent。

348
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:26,660
咁首先咧，我要向大家報告咧，西九文化區A C項目咧嘅誒邀請投標函件咧，啊今日已經送達咗畀喺意向書評審階段入圍嘅申請者。

349
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:58,880
第一個階段咧係係遞交發展樣書，啊！依個階段咧喺二零一九年嘅八月廿六號咧已經截止咗，市場嘅反應咧非常啊反應比較熱烈。嗱，經過評審嘅嘅嘅過程咧，嚇入圍嘅申請人咧已經順利選出咗啦。

350
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:33,850
另外咧，我哋有個酒店同辦公室兩個總嘅發展面積咧，係達到八萬一千平方米嚇。你啊，再其他咧就有零售達有乜？嗱，六千八百九十四平方米左右嘅發展啊，總共加加起嚟咧，就大約係啊十三萬四千九百幾平方米。

351
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:23,520
故宮博物故博物院、M加博物館同埋係演藝綜合劇場嘅，咁呢一個A C E嘅組合咧係非常之重要，因為咧誒佢完成咗之後咧就會喺誒西誒文化區嘅西部咧就會係形成咗一個完善嘅文化小區嘅，咁各樣措施咧就會係達達成一個協同效應嘅。咁而家接住咧。

352
01:11:56,510 --> 01:12:16,520
A.C.總發展嘅樓面面積咧為十三萬約十三萬五千十呎十一三一三四九三手啊平方米，其中咧展覽中心啊好重要，佔得四萬七千啊左右嘅啊平方米嘅面積。咁喺個誒展覽中心裏邊咧，將會設立有一個需要可以容納一一萬觀眾嘅表演場地。

353
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:11,160
啊！我哋依個啊唔A C E項目嗰個。

354
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,730
投標人必須咧滿足咗我哋嘅標書裏邊嘅要求咧，先有進入下階段嘅評審。

355
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:58,550
噉我哋誒喺今日已經開始誒發出招招標邀請邀邀請函啦。

356
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:22,740
咁下一個階段評審咧就係技術性嘅評審，啊，技術評評審咧亦都包括三大方面。

357
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:41,320
噉我而家講講介紹一下咧，A C項目將來嘅就選選標嗰陣時嘅甄選嘅嘅準則。

358
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:53,290
咁再啊，再下再下一個啊方面咧，就係喺發展階段嘅能嘅能力，我哋考去考考察嘅能力，就包括咗項目推進嘅嘅團隊嘅嘅能力啦。

359
01:14:55,890 --> 01:15:08,160
財政嘅能力，同埋咧嚇佢係管轉納中心同埋酒店管理營運公司咧嘅資格，有噉嘅有噉嘅嘅經驗嘅噉嘅資格去去去去做呢個項目，呢個咧係強制性嘅。

360
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:55,470
咁評選咧係會分個三個階段去進行評選。啊，第一個階段咧，啊就係個投標者咧必須滿足強制標準嘅內容。嘅內容咧包括咗個個投標人嘅股東嘅。

361
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:30,480
資格評審嗰陣時，個個個預審嘅啊裏邊咧係包括咗幾個幾個標嘅標準嘅。第一嚇就係我哋啊各隊項目嘅環境同埋嘅策略啦，啊同埋有關人士嘅經濟能力同埋財務嘅能力。

362
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:47,780
個物業完咗合約期，完咗四十三年之後點交翻畀西九嗰陣時嘅安排嘅有咩考慮？咁另外咧啊，仲係有喺依方面嘅嘅經驗，我哋亦都係進行我哋考考核嘅其中一個一個要點。

363
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:28,540
嘅限期限咧嘅年限咧，啊，我哋就係誒係四十三年定係四十三年，其中咧就包括咗五年嘅建建設期。咁呢個年期咧係符合A C項目係屬於長屬於長線投資嘅嘅項目嘅性質嘅。

364
01:15:53,570 --> 01:16:12,360
啊個設計嘅概念同埋設計嘅時間表，同埋個工程採用嘅點點樣去揾去揾嘅成成員商嘅安排。另外咧啊，就係嗰個啊項目管理嘅嘅嘅管嘅能力。另外再更仲繼續咧喺持續性發展嗰方面咧，你就做啲咩工作？

365
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:52,420
咁另外咧就仲有喺佢發展營運方面嘅嘅能力，到最後咧就提係冇有冇試過做過啊，即係公營合作嘅BOT項目嘅經驗。我哋依幾方面咧嚟考考慮過之後咧，就從而就選出啊有啊合合標準嘅入入圍入圍人士。

366
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:43,030
啊，其實第一方面咧，啊就係喺商啊商業同埋法律方方面嘅，包括咗個股權、股權同埋個組織嘅架構啦。第二咧就係個項目管理嘅風險管理嘅方面嘅一級特嘅計劃。第三咧就商業架構，即係裏邊個個大section商業架構。另外咧就融資計劃啦，佢點樣揾錢翻嚟做依個項目。

367
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:34,040
再跟住落嚟咧，係第三階段就係亦都重要嘅咧，就係營運方面嗰個階段嘅嘅個方面嘅考慮啦。我哋咧就要睇佢嘅業務計劃，佢又點樣計劃去去營運呢個項目。另外咧啊，就係開業之前係佢個準備咧啊，佢有幾有有有啲乜嘢嘅準備。再其次咧，就係開業之後個物業管理設施方面啊，個安排點樣？

368
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,620
誒，陳淑莊。

369
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:47,360
誒，仲有馬鳳國語。好。

01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:15,620
技術嘅評核之後，先至先至開始進行第三第三部分嘅。

372
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:07,510
A.C.E嘅項目聚焦咧，就係在於推動西九文化區嘅藝術目標。

373
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:54,020
噉啊，總理局咧係有權咧，係保保留取消本次招標嘅權利嘅。

374
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:48,630
以啊，而由董事局作出決定去選定啊成成功嘅嘅人嘅投標投標人士。

375
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:15,580
同埋展覽中心、酒店、辦公室以及零售餐飲業設施相關嘅商業潛力之間嘅協同效應。

376
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:42,700
我哋喺個合同裏邊亦都定明咧，啊A C項目同埋西九文化區裏邊相關設施嘅配合要求，啊同而而確保咧A C項目同西九其他嘅設施咧係有兼容。

377
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:59,480
合同裏邊亦都有機制咧，嚇去監督確保咧中標人士咧能夠達到我營運上嗰個要求，亦亦亦都會設立咧，係我哋嘅KPI關鍵嘅績效嘅指標嚇，用嚟評核嘅成嘅成果嘅。

378
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:27,670
除咗喺定期需要提誒提提交嗱進度報告之外咧，啊，有中中標人士亦都係需嗱，我哋會成立一個誒聯絡會會議咧，就作為一個溝通橋嘅嘅渠道，啊，保持個溝通能夠暢暢順嘅。

379
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:12,280
喺建設管管理嘅啊個階段咧，啊合同裏邊已經列出咗咧管理局監督設計同埋建造工程質量及進度嘅嘅要求。合同裏邊咧亦都亦都設有咧工程啟動嘅同埋進工時間表嘅框架。

380
01:16:51,560 --> 01:17:11,570
啊！另外就過咗呢兩階段之後咧，到第第三個階段咧就係講錢啦。啊，就我哋係要睇要睇下啊，呢個啊投標人士係願意成分分幾多嘅百分比，係即係收入百分比嘅。呢個就係誒個錢嘅嘅嘅考慮啦，財政方面嘅考慮。又第又第第三部分，我哋咧係做完咗第二部分嘅技術。

381
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:41,670
噉啊！當我哋評評選完啦之後咧，我哋就會按照個綜合評綜誒綜合啊個評分咧啊，要嚟要嚟排排排名次。咁而我哋我哋有個投標小啊管管理小組咧啊，就啊就係會按照我哋既定嘅程序咧，就向董事局啊就嚟啊嚟嚟建議啊提出提出啊建建議。

382
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:38,280
啊！我哋計劃咧係如果A C項目喺二零二年年底嚟定到標咧，係我哋個個估計咧喺二零二五到二零二六年間咧就可以進攻啦。啊，多謝呢個就報告。好多謝你。誒，而家提問時間，第一位係陳淑莊議員，都係四分鐘先啦。好啊，多謝主，多謝多謝主席，唔好意思。

383
01:19:47,760 --> 01:20:07,770
好，阿陳淑莊議員，多謝主席。咁咧就睇翻咧嗰個發展嘅面積咧，同翻誒完整體西九嗰個比較咧，我就發現咧呢個零售、餐飲、消閒嗰度咧接近係百分之五十嘅。咁誒其他文化藝術就大概百分之十四啦。誒酒店、辦公室、住宅咧就百分之廿二啦。我講緊嗰係A。

384
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:27,780
A.C.E就已經佔咧西九整體啦，因為整體咧就係一三八三六零，咁A.C.E咧就差唔多接近七千，咁即係咧誒都誒對唔住，咦少咗個sorry誒啊七千萬四啊，sorry係百百百分之五多少咗，噉我就想問下誒嗰度大概佔。

385
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,640
Okay.

386
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,200
四萬七。

387
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,950
會有啲乜嘢咧？唔該。

388
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,810
唔係，唔係，當年我係。

389
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,340
Mr. Chairman, there's a few points to make on this.

390
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:14,620
Performances etc. The second point that I think is relevant to this one is that at this stage, of course, we don't know which of the shortlisted tenderers is likely to win. But I can say that there is a good cross section of local and international interest at this stage.

391
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:15,660
There are sanctions provided for under the tender, including obviously the ultimate sanction of simply walking in and throwing them off the job. KPIs really refer to their performance once the ACE, particularly the convention centre element, is up and running.

392
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:47,790
嘅誒大概會係幾多嘢啦，同埋咧呢個機構及社區用途咧，將會係邊度會發生嘅噉就誒誒，主要係誒呢一個機構及社區用途。另外咧，我就想問一問咧嗰個關於呢個績效監督制度咧，就係嗰個KPI啦，即係key performance誒index啦噉。

393
01:20:47,790 --> 01:21:07,800
噉我就想問下喺個合約度你擺咗呢啲嘢，你係誒佢會有啲咩後果最嚴重嚇？即係會會誒相應會去到啲誒咩地步咧噉樣，即係會唔會甚至即係拎走唔畀去做，再重新招標咧咁？咁另外咧就誒，其實咧我睇到佢哋嗰啲話審核嗰啲資格。

394
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:27,810
咧噉，譬如話就誒，即係曾經係咪有過往接近嘅呢一啲嘅經驗啊等等？其實我成日諗到新世界，即係嗰啲管理誒誒誒展覽中心營運啊嗰啲噉樣嘅啫。咁跟住喺一誒故宮附近啊，可能加埋中資一個財團噉就唔。

395
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:47,820
之後咪就噉樣就會中標。我想先瞭解翻關於嗰個社區及誒，即係機構GIC咧嗰個用途會係點樣咧，同埋誒關於佢點樣可以用嗰個KPI誒最大嗰個後果係點樣？唔該，主席。係誒。I'll ask William to do with the space and I'll deal with the other issues.

396
01:21:47,820 --> 01:22:07,830
即係答咗第一個問題嘅嗰個就係嗰個面積嘅分佈。其實我哋係整個啲項目入邊有四萬七千零四十誒一嗰個誒面積咧，我係屬依個松寧個個喺個我哋個誒發展圖裏邊咧，啊個松寧就係A C F鬆鬆寧嚟嘅。啊噉，其他餘下嚟嘅八萬一同個嗰個面積咧，啊就係我哋可以我叫誒咩誒mix use。

397
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:27,840
啊，係多功能用途啊，所以兩個係好清晰咧，喺我哋個發展圖上高咧係表明出嚟嘅。咁所以係係係有好好好清晰嘅嘅嘅嘅噉嘅依據作為依據嘅。我我我知，即係因為而家你嗰個Convention Centre嗰度，即係你嗰個誒誒Convention Centre，你而家當係文化藝術設施啊嘛，因為多功能啊嘛。係，噉啊都係。

398
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:51,580
我話個convention centre本身係多功能，可以做埋藝術，所以你當咗佢係文化藝術設施，唔係當係商業嘢，係咪？係係，我跟咗十幾年啊，咁跟住之後我就想問下嗰個KPI，你點樣去去跟進到可以確保到佢係跟足你哋個KPI，同埋你啲KPI大概？

399
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:22,330
係。

400
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,940
啊！

401
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,570
六六第二round係OK，誒下一位係陳志全議員。

402
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:29,070
Mr. Chairman, first of all, the one of the benefits of going out for this approach is to

403
01:27:49,390 --> 01:28:03,020
respond to that requirement as part of their tender submission. Finally, you asked when is the the site likely to be handed over for the developer? I would expect that to be next year.

404
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:23,960
Okay，好，sorry，I I do have one more the 43 years question。That was actually a result of the first round the expression of interest exercise where we got very strong feedback that the original time frame simply would not have allowed it to be commercially viable。So we adjusted that。

405
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:21,390
營運移交，當初你上嚟我哋嗰度係咪講緊五年加三十年？我唔記得咗。咁今日咧就呢份就係講咗四十三年係五年加三十八年嘅營運期。咁呢個變化係幾時變？同埋嗰個理據嚇係點樣計出嚟嘅？唔該。

406
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:35,950
But before you reach the ultimate sanction, you should be able to take action. Is that better? You should be able to. We will be able to take action to work with the the successful tenderer, because there will be ongoing, very regular. In fact, we envisage monthly.

407
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:55,960
Interface meetings with the operator to make sure that they're first complying with the requirements under the tender. Secondly, that they're delivering according to their tender submission, and that means, for example, the range and type of programming that they're putting on in the exhibition centre, both exhibitions.

408
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:41,100
係誒唔該，主席。主席，我第一個問題咧就係嗱，而家呢笪地即係四萬七千零四十五平方米呢笪展覽中心嘅地咧，其實過去都用咗嚟做好多嘅誒露天嘅活動啊、音樂會啊噉樣。咁如果呢呢笪地即係正式動工之後，噉就即係嗰度唔能夠即係再。

409
01:24:41,100 --> 01:25:01,110
去使用啦，咁西九係冇冇一冇冇另一笪可以差唔多嘅地可以畀我哋做到類似嘅活動㗎啦？咩？咁呢度以係幾時會即係正式係圍圍封，即係準備開工就唔可以畀其他用途咧？噉樣呢個第一。第二係關於誒呢個展覽中心咧。

410
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:22,230
西九畀嗰個誒招標者嗰個限制，其實係包括啲乜嘢咧？誒，除咗話佢一定要起一個誒多功能用途嘅主場館，要有一萬個座位嘅，咁其他嗰啲係咪就佢設計畀你？即係好似做會展噉樣，即係佢點樣去去冇點樣去設計嗰個地方？咁同。

411
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:42,240
噉啊，點樣去令到呢樣嘢呢個誒多功能主場館係叫做用喺文化藝術上邊咧？係只能用喺文化藝術啦，定係文化藝術優有優先權去使用咧？即係好老實，我哋起紅磡體育館嘅時候，我諗當初低温撥款嘅人都未必諗到佢最後嘅主用途係諗。

412
01:25:42,240 --> 01:26:02,250
流行音樂演唱會為主導嘅咁未來呢一個誒展覽中心噉，其實嗰個用途嘅限制係你而家已經畀咗啲招標者。如果係係啲乜嘢嘢咧，即係點樣係叫做係文化藝術主導咧噉樣。另外，我想問埋就係嗰個誒現場嗰個建造。

413
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:43,740
我。

414
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:30,650
好，下一位誒，黃碧雲係陳志賢議員。其實佢未答嗰個。

415
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:12,130
figure is, but since you have a number of different tenderers, we would like to see what those tenderers come up with as the balance, and that's why.

416
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:20,880
You know, it is part of the tender requirement. It's not something that at this stage we need to decide, but we will be very clear when the tender is awarded.

417
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:42,500
展覽中心啲嗰個藝術下規限係點樣？畀嗰個誒招標者或者使用者點樣去確保個係藝術文化為主導？係。

418
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:56,570
即係我哋，我哋講啊，我哋喺一九九七年嘅時候都冇諗到，而家嚟到今日嘅時候，一國兩制都變曬樣，走曬形啦。而家你哋講緊四十三年，咁主席，我覺得咧，政府應該要解釋清楚一個物業去到四廿三年。

419
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:49,360
be able to benefit from the creative design that a commercial operator may come up with. So yes, of course, we want to encourage them to design something which is innovative, usable, user-friendly, and of course, most importantly, complies with the requirements. So for example, they must be able to

420
01:26:49,360 --> 01:27:09,370
sit ten thousand for an indoor concert. They must be able to accommodate a certain number of exhibitors, etc. So all of the design requirements are specified in the tender documentation. But what we're trying to get is their innovation and creativity to come up with the best.

421
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:29,380
design solution。 in terms of the question about the outdoor area, of course we have already re-provision that and the the lawn in the existing art park can accommodate up to ten zero audiences. We also have two smaller lawns which can accommodate up to

422
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:49,390
a few thousand, so in fact we've more than compensated from the area that was previously within the nursery park. With regard to the the question of the priority to art and culture, that is of course specified as a tender requirement, and therefore when we get the tenders back, we expect to see how they intend to.

423
01:28:44,880 --> 01:29:04,890
As I said in my reply, we're specifying that art and culture should lead the use of this facility. What we're waiting to see is how they respond to that requirement, and that will be assessed as part of the tender. So at this stage, we expect them to be suggesting you know eighty percent, seventy percent, whatever the.

424
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:41,320
下一位誒係黃碧雲議員。主席，我都想跟進咧文件第十一段嗰度呢度咧係講緊誒呢個A C E嘅誒工程係用B O T啊，建造營運同移交咁呢個年期咧係非常非常之長，係講緊四。

425
01:29:41,320 --> 01:30:01,330
十三年當中五年建造期，然後三十八年嘅營運期之後先交翻畀政府。嗱，呢個咧比原先之前咧講嘅誒五加三十係誒再延長多八年。噉我係唔係好理解，即係政府點解要做呢個決定嘅？因為其實。

426
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:21,340
我哋之前處理啟德體育園嘅時候咧，都係講緊五加三十嘅時候，喺立法會都引起好大爭議嘅。誒民主派又好或者建制派議員都講緊，喂三廿年咁長，中間如果有啲咩嘢，我哋想畀意見或者佢哋做得好差，噉我哋都冇一個介入嘅機會㗎咯喎。咁嗰陣時都講緊。

427
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:41,350
會唔會三啊年再拆開十五年做一次中期嘅評估啊？咁如果佢做得好差，或者係即係有啲問題出咗嘅時候咧，都仲有機會可以劫佢做好啲噉。咁但係而家咧仲長咗啊！即係個營運期咧去到四十三年。喂，老實講，五十年不變，我哋而家二十三年都大變咗啦，香港，即係。

428
01:30:41,350 --> 01:31:01,360
邊個可以講到四廿幾年咧？而家係講緊去到二零六三年，即係我都唔知在座有幾多個仲在人世，即係呢度在座，即係包埋我哋都未必可以睇得到二零六三年。咁所以咧，我覺得即係呢個B.O.T.去到咁長嘅年期咧，其實係中。

429
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:21,370
單咧係令到立法會或者公眾更加難係插手去監察呢一個項目，就變咗好似紙鷯咁剪剪斷線飛出去啦。幾廿年之後都冇人記得佢點樣收翻呢個紙鷯翻嚟啦。咁所以我覺得咧，呢一個嘅年期咧，我哋係接受唔到啦。佢去到咧四廿幾年嘅。

430
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:41,380
即係我覺得，如果中間你係冇一個嘅檢討期，其實有啲似我哋講西税哇判咗畀佢咁長，中間真係仲可以畀佢可能二百幾蚊收費都得㗎噉。而家收你八啊蚊已經係一個利啦噉。咁所以咧，我覺得咧，即係係咪化一個化算嘅一個做法，或者係一個合理嘅做法咧？

431
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:16,860
即係講緊咧，三用咗三廿八年，其實咧根本上佢嗰個價值咧，我唔知會跌咗幾多啊！即係即係商界嘅人可能會計得準啲，到時可能物業要維修，又要唔知點樣點點樣交翻畀你嘅時候咧，都已經嗰個噉嘅展覽中心同啲酒店可能都要再大翻新，唔知點樣拆。

432
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:36,870
調查咗去啦，咁所以我想政府應該解釋一下，即係呢一個年期，你靜雞雞將佢又再延長咗，差唔多都你不如去盡五十年，係嘛？批地畀你批五萬年啊嘛，係咪越長越好咧？係咪發展商認為越長就對佢越有利咧？對於公眾嘅利益同埋立法會又點樣可以監察咧？好。

433
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:38,270
阿貝司長。

434
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,030
誒冇監察，因為其實誒。

435
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:32,420
擔心就話誒誒誒。

436
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:48,180
多謝主席，多謝黃議員提問。咁其實政府批呢個誒西九文化區嘅地畀西九文化管理局咧，就批五十年嘅。

437
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:09,480
啊！多謝。係咪係咪過咗之後，我哋四廿三年內都唔可以監察啦，即係唔可以有機會監察你呢個項目啦？誒，多謝多謝王議員啊！我諗其實咧誒。

438
01:33:48,490 --> 01:34:01,000
投票，因為如果投票嘅人得一兩個，其實你就冇選擇。咁所以我哋其實咧係希望個市場個反應好啲，等管理局係多啲選擇嘅。因為正如阿柏志高先生所講啦。

439
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:57,850
其實咧，我哋係變上嚟咧，係希望呢個整體嘅發展更加平衡，更加係可以達到原本嘅構思，即係話個重點應該文化藝術咯。即係你講緊係嗰個即係投資者嘅角度啊嘛，我嘅問題就係話咁公眾同埋立法會嗰個監管嘅角度咧。

440
01:32:48,460 --> 01:33:08,470
咁誒係喺但應該係喺二零一八一九年嘅時候咧，一八年定一九年咧。咁其實管理局咧係曾經咧就用一個叫做誒expression of interest，即係同一啲誒私人嗰啲咧係去睇一睇誒，通過一啲誒誒顧問咧睇下嗰個私人嗰個市場嗰個誒。

441
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:28,480
興趣係點樣樣啊？同埋係好粗略噉啊計一計嗰個誒營運嘅成本啊等等嘅。咁大家如果誒睇咗圖咧，就見到咧，其實呢個U型咧，其實咧就係西區隧道嘅出口嚟嘅。咁嗰度亦都有西隧啊，有好誒有誒高鐵啊等等。其實下邊咧係好難起嘅。咁所以咧喺個佢個古

442
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:48,490
估計嘅時候咧，原本係諗住係四年建築期嘅，但係發覺係唔得嘅，咁所以加咗啦。咁同埋由於咧嗰陣時估計嗰個成本啊、營運等等咧，咁亦都管理局咧向政府表示咧，嗰個年期咧係會比較長啲咧，咁咪好可能咧就多啲嘅誒私人嘅誒營運者咧係會有興趣。

443
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:21,290
其實佢揀咧唔單止係個價錢，其實睇佢整體嘅營運嘅方案。譬如話係可以點樣樣係誒畀翻呢啲較重嘅比例畀文化藝術啦，因為你知道即係其實佢都會係睇整體嘅營運，佢會喺咩年期內你可以畀佢去回本。如果你個回本期好短嘅，

444
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:41,300
噉佢可能咧就會收費更加高啦，佢就好可能咧嗰個比重咧亦都冇咁大。咁所以其實我哋嘅年期係長啲咧，就其實等呢一個變咗係一個更加有吸引力嘅一個投資嘅項目，令到喺嗰三十八年嘅營運裏邊咧，佢可以長啲年期去將佢嘅投資攞翻個回報。其實。

445
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:29,780
西誒西九文化管理局咧，佢作為一個誒公營嘅一個法定機構咧，同埋喺個法例上咧，亦都寫明咧，譬如佢開會咧要一個open session，要交代個進展啦，亦都佢有啲重要嘅發展，亦都要做誒，正如阿柏志高總裁講咧，要做一啲公眾嘅諮詢嘅。咁所以我相信咧，佢基本。

446
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:49,790
上一個運作咧，一定係要繼續係好透明化去做嘅。噉我相信佢喺個管理嗰個誒營運者一個合作者嘅時候咧，佢都一定有啲所謂KPI嘅個檢視嘅標準嘅。噉我相信咧喺呢啲喺佢誒選擇同埋同佢訂定嘅合約嘅時候咧，嗰度有包括在內。因為我希望大家明白咧。

447
01:35:49,790 --> 01:36:09,800
其實從個管理局嚟講咧，個管理局係冇噉嘅動機去為一個商業嘅機構去為佢去設想，令到佢賺多啲錢㗎嘛。其實管理局嘅動機都係希望做呢個文化區係做得比較係有聲有色，呢個先係管理局嘅目的啊嘛。咁所以咧，我覺

448
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,630
而家以而家市值嘅租金。

449
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,930
收翻嚟都要拆啦。

450
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,210
上咧係已經即係都都發揮咗一定嘅效用嘅嚇。

451
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:11,080
你而家同我講四十三年。

452
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:16,440
完全係不合常理、有違常規嘅啦。

453
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:19,130
你係有違常識㗎，你你真係講唔通啦！Defies common sense， please。

454
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:07,780
喂，下一位有冇孟正議員唔該。唔該，主席。喂，真係立法會嘅生涯，一星期也嫌長。

455
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:30,860
你你一般人嘅常識之中係不能夠存在呢四十三年嘅講法，幾乎係半個世紀啊！講緊收翻嚟嘅時候，B O T 最後 T for transfer。

456
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:49,950
你有冇搞錯啊？噉樣都講得出。而家尤其是我哋灣仔會展啊、機場亞博啊，全部喺度做緊啊擴建工程嘅時候，你又整咁大壇呢壇嘢，但係大得嚟咧，你不如送畀佢啦。

457
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:32,260
講得出，我哋在座係冇人可以捱到去啊！佢真係啊，落畀翻你啲物業嗰個年份㗎。我哋係呢度在座冇人，我認為好似應該係嚇，係睇唔到㗎，冇可能㗎。

458
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:13,500
有處理好嘅時候，你叫人哋啊，你寄望明日啦噉，呢呢個係不能想象，係我係好難接受。即係你以之前講三十八，你已經係哇，即係聽到就耳都側。你越講越過分，四十三年嘅標籤。

459
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:29,810
得，因為管理局知道咧，喺三十八年嘅營運期之後咧，呢成嚿嘢係畀翻佢嘅。咁所以我諗大家會睇得到咧，其實管理局嗰個所謂嘅利益咧，係應該同整體市民係睇文化藝術呢樣嘢，其實長遠嚟講係應該所謂align，應該係一致性嘅。咁所以我覺得亦都唔需要話係。

460
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:55,320
政府有幾個誒局長係佢嘅誒管理局成員嘅，管理局成員入邊咧，亦都需要有個立法會嘅委誒立法會嘅議員喺度嘅，亦都需要有文化界嘅代表嘅。咁亦都誒立法會議員咧，亦都係隨時可以向我哋提問嘅。咁所以我諗呢種種咧喺個機制上。

461
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:54,760
你而家日新月異，隨時改朝換代。你同我哋講四十三年，然後話哦主題咧就唔係話邊個邊個得耶？我哋主要係有吸引力嘅投資，就希望有投資者入嚟。但係噉樣係講唔通嘅咯。你連今日你都未能夠。

462
01:38:50,250 --> 01:39:10,260
唔係b o t啊，b o g g for give away。臨尾啊，唉，你就係完咗，就不如你要埋佢。噉你而家就反而啊收佢多啲啊。你真係四十三年，無論你點樣點樣啊澄清啊，又話我哋如此這般啊，有噉嘅需要啊。

463
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:39,420
好，誒啊，許先生，你容唔容許我少少加入？我諗可能議員咧或者市民咧要明，即係可能你哋喺度營運緊嗰樣嘢咧，你哋好明白。咁但係其實咧，我我我可唔可以？如果冇議員，你唔介意咧？其實我我我想加兩個問題，即係其實會唔會話其實？

464
01:39:42,070 --> 01:40:02,080
如果係二百蚊尺嘅要租你嗰度，如果嗰個發展商要搦三百三十億出嚟起嗰棟寫字樓嘅，計翻個樓面嘅GFA，即係嗰個嗰個樓面面積，佢要租幾多年佢先可以翻到個起棟樓起依棟樓嘅本錢？其實你哋係咪有某程度上？

465
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:16,620
We.

466
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,360
instead。

467
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:27,050
to attract investors.

468
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:22,050
can't you change your plan?

469
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:24,370
The primary intent is to get the exhibition centre, and unfortunately, worldwide exhibition centres struggle to make money.

470
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:15,180
誒，我明你個問題嚇。The chairman, I I think I think we need to take a step back and look at what was the original intent for the site.

471
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:55,380
頭先咧有啲議員咧係將誒啟德體育園咧嚟做一個對比，大家記得咧睇出睇出啟德體育園咧，其實我哋係批咗接近三百億。

472
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:47,230
都可能要拆咗佢再起過，未必嘅。如果係維修得好咧，管理得好咧，其實我哋今日見到嘅會展喺灣仔區嘅會展第一期已經超過四十年㗎啦。

473
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:36,610
管理費，佢要幾多年先回本？其實佢有幾多年賺錢咧？會唔會？如果係十五年，佢就一定蝕本，虧唔到本；二十年就掹掹緊，二十五年佢就賺少少，三十五年就賺曬咧。會唔會係噉嘅意思咧？噉樣？

474
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:44,140
問問第第一，我哋就係未。第一，我唔知個列嗰啲話肯畀幾多錢。一係招標項目啊，所以我唔可以估計話話話話咩啊，係係係佢出讓出幾多錢。當然啊，如果個時年期長啲咧，佢肯出錢嘅肯定會多啲嘅。啊，呢個呢個係表小姐。

475
01:42:48,230 --> 01:43:05,130
係啊，主席啊，嗱嗱，你用咗我少少時間，我想補翻啲啲，即係Is it possible at all for them to down size or down I don't know down scale the whole thing a bit to make it more the to make it sound more sensible?

476
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:22,090
咁噉啊！考慮嘅咧，亦會唔會話其實頭先阿毛議員講緊四四誒五年加三十八年，其實佢係咪如果要你哋嘅計算，會唔會佢係實係用咗個一百幾廿億起咗嗰棟寫字樓又好會議展覽中心又好，以而家市民或者係市場可以接受嘅租金或者？

477
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:59,960
啊！都都係最近好有好有趣嘅問題。我諗誒，好多人都會咁諗嚇。哇！整咗四十三年，好長時間，的確係四十三年好長時間。但係咧，搦一件嘢出嚟賣咧，啊！我第一呢個呢個係一個公開招標嘅嘅嘅嘅嘅項目嚟嘅。啊！我搦一件嘢出嚟賣，不如用三十年同賣用四十三年咧，個價錢會唔一樣嘅啊？因為因因為。

478
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:19,970
嚟講咧，即係大家計計條數嘅啫嚇。我我喺項目入邊收幾多錢，就就搦幾多錢出嚟畀畀畀翻出嚟嚇，合唔合算？合算我就做，唔合算我就唔做。咁當然咧，大前提咧嚇就一定係要能收回成本嘅。啊，如果成本收唔埋咧，收唔回咧啊，呢樣嘢咧就係就係要要冇人肯嚟做㗎啦。噉我哋A C項目咧，所以your plan is all flawed.

479
01:41:56,040 --> 01:42:16,050
畀佢係起嘅，所以佢純粹係營運，即係主要係營運多嘅。呢一度咧，成嚿年起都要佢去出嘅。咁所以我諗大家要明白，佢一個好大嘅投資，然後係通過佢嘅營運，將佢嘅投資，佢可能有部分係要借貸嘅，呢啲等等係要還本。咁同埋我哋嘅規定。

480
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:36,060
咧就其實佢喺A.C.嘅發展組合咧，有百分之三十五係做展覽中心，而百分之六十咧係酒店同埋出租辦公室嘅。大家諗下出租酒店同出租辦公室嗰個回本率咧，即係回本嘅期唔係咁快嘅。咁同埋大家睇到咧，即係頭先當初即係啲同誒有啲議員話，會三十年後。

481
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:10,520
誒，多謝主席。

482
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:54,780
先啦，好啊。

483
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:27,990
they they are very difficult commercial propositions.

484
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:33,260
當我們 went out for the first round of consultation，那feedback was incredibly strong。

485
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:13,190
經營年期唔夠，而係有呢個要求咧，咁即係佔嘅比例有幾高咧？咁呢個係第二個問題。

486
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:25,020
即係我就想了解多少少咧，即係首先第一咧，誒呢個項目噉樣嘅投標咧個數額相當大，咁但係我哋而家咧只係得幾四啊幾分鐘去討論咧，即係我自己第一係覺得唔係時間唔係好足夠。

487
01:43:53,550 --> 01:44:08,830
過The road and over the western harbour portal, it's simply not feasible given the huge costs involved for us to expect a private sector investor to absorb all of that risk without a concession, and

488
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:53,550
It's also worth bearing in mind that we are trying to maximise the size of the exhibition centre within the space, and as the permanent secretary quite rightly pointed out, the exhibition centre uses the only flat land in that area. The hotel and office are actually built over.

489
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:29,120
什麼是點解我們做一個表達興趣的練習，而簡單地忽略我們收到的回饋？非常非常強的回饋，來自於我們與所有這些人對話，而且非常一致。所以我們正在積極地回應這個回饋。主席，最後最後，他真的不擔心會變成。

490
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:49,130
又一個大白象，完全冇擔心，no worries。我我我諗頭先佢嘅重重點係話，因為而家同頭先講個體啟德體育園係唔同一樣嘢嚟嘅。啟德體育園唔係投資者投資嘅，唔係我冇用過啟德，做咩你你係要話我講咧？我冇提過啟德。

491
01:44:49,130 --> 01:45:09,140
有有有，唔緊要。其實呢個係個投資嚟嘅，即係等於你政府投標買塊地，我塊地投咗三千億，噉我要回本咁解啫。我諗政府嘅意思係你就算將佢再切細咗佢，佢每一平方米都有個回本期㗎嘛。唔緊要啦。誒，問馮國義唔該。

492
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:45,310
咁但係我想了解嘅咧就係誒，即係政府第一個階段就話即係邀請意向書啦。咁誒，政府頭先介紹就話反應非常熱烈。噉我想了解咧，到底熱烈到咩程度咧？有幾多份噉樣嘅發展意向書係遞交咗畀西九管理局咧？呢個第一個問題啦。

493
01:45:46,410 --> 01:46:06,420
噉，但係即係頭先啊，總裁咧亦都講咗誒，因為咧誒呢啲誒意向書裏邊咧反映咗佢哋認為咧三十年營運期係唔夠，咁所以先至要延長到三十八年，再加五年建築。噉我又好想問下咧呢呢個好熱烈嘅反應裏邊咧，有幾多人係覺得誒？

494
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:33,530
咁第三問題咧就係話誒，即係政府就話挑選咗誒若干位入圍嘅申請者。噉我都好想了解咧，即係你點樣挑選呢啲入圍嘅申請者咧？即係佢哋嘅挑選嘅準則係咩咧？咁咁呢啲誒挑選咗嘅誒入圍嘅。

495
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:53,540
機構啦嚇，或者公司咧，能唔能夠透露即係增加啲透明度嘅咧？咁呢個第三個問題。然之後咧，就我想問咧，呢啲誒誒，即係被挑選咗個入圍嘅機構咧，有冇一啲境外嘅公司，定係話全部都係本地嘅公司？即係佢嘅性質係點嘅咧？即係先係呢幾個問題。

496
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:15,430
Mr. Chairman, we did have very strong interest, and in fact, we had formal submissions from eight interested parties at the end, and we shortlisted that. I don't think it's appropriate to get into the shortlisting for commercial reasons, for obvious reason, but I will say that of those eight.

497
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:37,740
The.

498
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:02,610
To an earlier question, within the shortlisted tenderers.

499
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:35,590
In terms of the shortlisting criteria.

500
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:40,350
定係話呢個都係佢投標嘅誒一個條件。嗯嗯。總總裁係啊。

501
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:52,170
展嘅權益注資翻落去西九，因為西九財務上係行唔通嘛，即係原來嗰個噉，所以先要增加呢個即係誒融資嘅可行性啦。噉。

502
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:34,850
係係包含喺佢嘅投標裏邊咧，即係第一筆嘅錢，即係upfront嘅錢，有冇包含喺裏邊？如果有咧，即係嗰個數額大概會係幾多？即係能唔能夠有透露咧？

503
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:30,490
certainly seven that I personally spoke to, and indeed in their submissions commented on the duration as being a criterion that they were concerned about. So it was very strong response both from the interested parties, but also on that particular point.

504
01:50:52,480 --> 01:51:09,220
都唔係一個公平地向每一個投標者明示嘅話咧，噉你嗰啲標將來你點樣去評估邊一個係更加有利咧？咁有啲人就front end loading，即係喺前邊好大嚿；有啲人咧back end loading。噉你點樣去比較？

505
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:19,980
another upfront payment required to secure as a bond for the development period, and there'll of course one of the criteria that we'll be looking at is the payments and the payment schedule subsequent to the operation of the facility. So there are various stages at which we expect payments from the tender tenderers.

506
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:58,430
The tender has gone out now. Obviously, we're waiting to see how they respond to that. So I don't think I can really comment further on the shortlisted ten potential tenderers, except to say that we believe we have a a good cross section of both local and international interest. As I said earlier in in response.

507
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:22,900
O.K.噉我跟住落嚟嘅問題咧，就想問誒，無論係喺第一輪即係邀請佢哋表達意向嘅時候，或者係喺你而家準備投標嘅時候，除咗佢哋嗰個建築嘅投入咧，其實佢哋需唔需要或者即係管理局會唔會要求佢哋有一筆誒使用權費？

508
01:48:40,650 --> 01:49:00,660
Mr. Chairman, there are in fact a number of stages. There are fees that are required to be paid. There's a fee simply to secure the tender documentation, which is quite substantial. And then once we've selected the final tenderer to be awarded, there is a

509
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:40,270
我諗係員嘅意思係唔係話佢會唔會有一個保證金去誒去ensure佢做到啲KPIs係咪噉嘅意思啊？誒呢個一個方面，但係更加緊要就係佢投標嘅時候有冇需要一筆個畀一筆錢畀西九，因為其實西九即係政府點解會將呢啲地發？

510
01:49:52,450 --> 01:50:12,460
與呢個up翻即係第一筆嘅錢，其實理論上等於西九可以調動嚟去起其他嘅設施㗎嘛。咁所以我我就好想了解咧，呢一呢一筆噉嘅錢，即係係咪在一個投？即即即簡單嚟講，有冇地價啦？誒，使權價，解釋咩意思？係咩嘅意思？

511
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:32,470
Easy啊！Mr. Chairman, we we can't take a land premium for obvious reasons. But perhaps I can I just clarify my earlier answer. One of the criteria that will be assessed in the tender is the the payment schedule that that the

512
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:52,480
successful tenderers will submit，因為， obviously， there are different ways that you can structure your your repayments， and the board will assess which is to the most advantageous to the authority。所以，那呢度就我我會有少少關注嘅就係，因為如果你連呢一筆噉嘅錢

513
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,220
係秘書長。

514
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,540
from the ACE.

515
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:27,750
係。OK，多謝誒。

516
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:20,360
邊樣嘢先係最好嘅咧？即係變咗你唔即係好多個標準都係移動緊嘅噉嘅情況，你點樣去評估嗰個標書誒是否合理咧？咁？

517
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:32,430
誒有冇補充？Yeah, I agree. It's a difficult issue. That's one of the most complex aspects of this tender process. What we're trying to do is is to achieve

518
01:53:49,860 --> 01:54:03,730
But it isn't going to be enough to get us out of the hole that we're digging for 2A, 2B, 2C. There's absolutely no way. It'll be a contribution, but it it won't help us fund any of the remaining arts and culture facilities. That's very clear.

519
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:47,380
a tender submission from each of the shortlisted tenderers that allows comparison across the tenders, and that's the objective. But we also want to be able to, again, come back to my earlier point, seek

520
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:23,460
In terms of the vehicle egress, yes, as we said in that presentation, it is in part to ensure that when there are programmes there, people don't have to come back into the main district. They can exit the site straight onto the Western Highway, Western Harbour Crossing Highway. That's all part of the design.

521
01:51:47,680 --> 01:52:07,690
alternatives that will allow a better return for the authority, a better payment schedule. So these are variants that we can look at. But there is a requirement for a base type of payment, and it's the variance from that payment that we'll be assessing. You should be able to do that on a consistent basis。嗰一個月首先，housekeeping matter。誒，因為我哋仲有兩個。

522
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:27,700
位第二輪，我誒將個會議最多延長十五分鐘，因為我有其他事項嘅，好嘛？好誒，而家請陳淑莊議員第二輪。多謝主席。我我覺得頭先馬鳳國議員嗰個誒嗰個問題當然又好有道理嘅，因為但係呢個亦都跌，即係好睇究竟誒西九嗰個cash flow。

523
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:47,860
究竟出現咩問題？咁呢個就會係我哋下次會議去講。本來就係二零一九年年尾到，大概就有個結果，因為佢揾咗即係做一個財務嘅安排嘅嘅研究。咁但係我都想誒瞭解翻咧，就係因為呢個直接都同我個問題相關嘅，就係有冇機。

524
01:52:47,860 --> 01:53:07,870
機會，你估計或者甚至呢一個，唔係其中一個你誒會參考嘅指標，就係A.C.E能夠會唔會有機會帶到一啲錢多餘嘅錢去發展Stage Three，第即係二二思嗰扎嗰扎誒誒呢一個文化設施啊。

525
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:28,030
即係我唔知道等到幾時先有嗰啲，即係等運到。咁誒，第另外一個問題咧就誒實際少少嘅，我就想問下關於嗰個接駁嘅，即係我頭先如果你攞翻頭先嗰個誒最對上嗰個，就有個新出口行車道，係咪其實都有啲同？

526
01:53:28,030 --> 01:53:48,040
呢一個A.C.E.嘅發展係相關連咧，誒咁嗰個年期嗰度相關係咪可以配合得到？而誒幾幾確定，即係呢個係真係做得到咯？我都想了解一下。係啊，Mr. Chairman，we absolutely expect there will be some surplus。

527
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:50,680
其實誒明白誒，議員係關注Song to C入邊嗰啲誒文化藝術嘅發展嘅，因為喺當初嘅概念嚟講咧，誒其實誒A C E咧係政府唔會攞一筆即係起初唔會攞筆錢，誒管理局亦都唔會嘅。咁同埋大家就算咧記得喺誒大家批錢畀佢中。

528
01:54:50,680 --> 01:55:10,690
合地庫嘅時候咧，其實政府出嘅咧都係一個基本誒基礎嘅設施嚟嘅。咁喺呢個地庫入邊咧，仲有一啲基建工程等等嘅嘢，其實都要西九自己畀嘅。噉我可以好白講一句咧，因為大家當初亦都覺得即係我哋誒唔想政府再補錢，內西九啦。咁所以咧，其實當初咧就係話呢個所謂Phase Three。

529
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:49,250
係可能一個。

530
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:52,440
包括咗咧，即係啲人點樣行過嚟咧？即係以前咧，你仲有嗰邊可以誒入口㗎嘛？

531
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:15,370
interest to us. If they could do it, say in four years, by using creative technology or creative techniques, that's something we would certainly look at.

532
01:57:52,750 --> 01:58:06,890
高嘅屏風，咁嗰啲嗰啲誒，即係嗰啲空氣嘅汽車嗰啲污染啊，嗰啲嘢，我唔知道誒噪音同埋空氣污染嗰啲係會點樣影響，即係成個九龍站上邊嗰啲嘅居民。

533
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:44,680
誒，即係工程開展之後咧，即係大概五年時間建造。建造期間咧，其實之前上一個項目，我哋討論嗰啲行人啊、車啊嗰啲連接係會唔會受到呢個A.C.E嘅工程影響？

534
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:47,580
查咧係真係，除非除非係撥畀佢嘅啫。即係呢個，即係如果大家要睇到一個話，要一個確實嘅年期。咁但係呢個就似乎即係誒到目前為止咧，大家亦都覺得唔應該再放公帑落去。但係我可以講，如果你哋希望有個確實嘅年期，係鬆to C咧。

535
01:55:10,690 --> 01:55:30,700
第三期嘅一個文化藝術咧嘅設施咧，就係誒等西九係由佢嘅商業發展，特別係Zone Two上面嘅商業發展咧，有咗個誒相當嘅一個盈餘，佢先開始發展嘅。坦白講，如果係真係係真係想心急，好快睇到Music Centre、Grand Theatre。

536
01:55:49,570 --> 01:56:09,580
即係嗯，即係公眾出錢去起佢係一個方法。阿阿主席，我真係加一句先，我希望可以確保得到咧，嗰個Convention Centre係真係可以做到藝術嘅嘢，因為你要記得佢用咗係文化嗰邊去計數嘅，即係嗰個嗰個GFA嚇。所以我覺得要對公道嗰個希望係你哋。

537
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:29,590
其中一個可以長期監察住佢嘅其中一個可能，我唔但係我我當然唔知道點可以監察三啊幾四啊幾年啊！嚇呢個揾日先再問啦，唔該。嗯，好嘅，好下一位誒，請啊黃碧雲議員第二啦。誒誒，我想問咧，就係誒嗰個A C E咧，如果而家即係誒誒。

538
01:56:52,720 --> 01:57:12,730
咁噉，如果工程進行期間，係咪全部入唔到？一定係要靠你起好誒元芳嗰邊搭過嚟嗰條橋之後，先至誒博得到嘅咧。咁即係呢呢個係嗰個影響會係點樣？第二個咧，我想問嗰個攤分嘅比例，財務上邊攤分比例嘅安排文件就話，如果投標嗰啲。

539
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:32,740
人咧，即係個攤分比例太低，低到你哋覺得唔合理咧，你就會啊，全部都reject佢㗎咁噉，即係話其實你哋都係有個底線喺度啦。咁即係嗰個攤分嘅準則應該係誒係啲咩嘅準則咧？係咪價高者得噉係嘛？即係如多分畀西九管理局咧，你哋就就就接受佢咧噉。即係呢個第二個。

540
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:52,750
第三個就純粹想問咧，就係因為呢個酒店同埋出租辦公室咧，佢係繞住西九嗰個隧道出口嗰度起嘅。噉我想問一問，嗰度大概其實係會起幾多高、幾多層嘅咧？因為如果你好高嘅話咧，我都唔知啦。佢會做成一個屏風咧，成個九龍站上邊咧畀你包住一個好。

541
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:51,150
你係。

542
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,040
係咪好理想咧？定係話？

543
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,920
好，下一位馬逢國議員第二輪。

544
02:02:56,320 --> 02:03:00,910
誒適當嘅調整一下，可能會得翻嚟嘅效果會更加好咧。

545
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:40,890
啊，同埋M加苗絲人嗰度咯。啊，主席，我仲有一個問啫，因為水上的士咧，就係頭先你自己講咧，就會喺呢一個A C E項目嗰個範圍。

546
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:12,990
Yup, Duncan. Mr. Chairman, in fact, we've debated this internally with the board and through our public-private partnership committee, which advises the board on this issue.

547
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:53,490
誒，多謝主席。即係我嘅問題咧，其實就係想問翻啊，因為而家啱我哋香港仲喺個疫情嘅進展之中啦，咁而全世界其實都係面對同樣一個問題。

548
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:49,450
嗯，即係唔會因為工程進展而令到啲車啊人啊行唔到。啊，你嚇又又要求要保持要保持依個啲通道嘅，因為即即唔會啦，係咪簡單嚟講？係啊，即係唔會令到佢行唔到。係係係啊係啦係啦。

549
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:19,270
即係我真係唔知你之前個item同而家呢個item兩item之間，即係係咪相容到咯？你明唔明啊？即係我哋想啲人好方便去到西九，但係佢原來一上嚟嘅時候係個地盤，咁又唔知行唔行得到去M加嗰邊，咁即係揾嚟搞嘅啫喎，即係我簡單簡單回答問。

550
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:38,300
Fact, there are two piers being studied. One will basically serve M Plus Lyric and that Artist Square area. The second one will serve the ACE project. So of course, we're looking to time the development of the two in line with the delivery of those projects.

551
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:27,410
主席，In fact, there are height restrictions which apply in that part of the district. The highest area is actually the area that's occupied by the M+ museum, and that falls down to roughly half of that in the area surrounding the ACE. So there is no opportunity to build tall in that case.

552
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:47,420
In terms of the assessment, why would we cancel a bid? Obviously, the income sharing would be would be a key criterion. But frankly, it would also come down to whether or not we had received bids that comply with our other requirements as well. We always reserve the right.

553
01:58:47,420 --> 01:59:07,430
not to award a tender if we don't get acceptable submissions from those tenderers, so that's just a a basic requirement. In terms of the the construction period, if the the construction can be done quicker, then of course it's to our advantage, and that would be.

554
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:35,750
照啦，另外仲有補充就當行人嘅安排咧嚇，我哋係有有要求佢係就保持個個個路嘅暢暢通。當然啦，因為日我我我哋嗰個就新嗰條路咧嘅建築仲要好多要協調嘅。咁但係我原則上係要要求佢係保持嚇行人，行人可以可以可以喺嗰嗰嗰邊行入去西九。

555
01:59:51,940 --> 02:00:11,950
即係因為即係你如果諗翻咧，個影響就唔會太大，但係就要即係最重要係嗰條橋，即係大家喺上個月嘅財委會批准咗嗰條橋啦。嗰條橋大概要二十五個月去起好嘅，嚇。咁喺嗰條橋未起好之前咧，咁可能嗰度都會仍然係誒，即係行人嘅暢達有影響。但係條橋起好。

556
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:31,960
到咗之後咧，咁大部分因為其實喺成個西九嘅設計咧，係其實希望大部分嘅用者咧係用一個公共交通網絡嘅。譬如佢係搭地鐵咧，由元芳嗰度出嚟就行呢條橋過。如果呢條橋做咗之後咧，就其實咧誒，我都冇乜意欲佢係去西邊個嗰嗰個地盤住嘅，所以佢主要咧係嗰度去翻。

557
02:00:41,170 --> 02:01:01,180
嗰度嘅，即係嗰個上上落，咁如果你嗰度一上落，其實喺個地盤咧，其實即係大家就除咗去嗰度翻工咧，就冇人會去嗰度嘅喎，因為你嗰個應該二零二二年就應該起好嘅啦嘛，嗰個水上的士嘅一個誒長期嘅一個上落嘅誒點，噉。

558
02:01:53,770 --> 02:02:13,780
咁喺噉嘅狀態咧，其實好多嘅企業咧都會面臨好多嘅唔不確定性嘅因素嘅。咁特別喺財務上咧係更加難預計。噉我哋而家咧即係招標啱啱就喺呢個時候進行之中。噉我想問一個問題就係話，其實而家呢個噉嘅情況，佢進行一個噉嘅招標。

559
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:33,790
到底係對成件事嚟講係好事啊，定係唔好咧？噉我自己個人嘅傾向就唔係一個好理想嘅時候嘅。咁如果喺噉嘅情況之下，令到即係所有參與投標嘅公司咧喺財務嘅評估上邊咧，會採取一個誒好自然地會採取一個比較。

560
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:53,800
保守嘅態度嘅噉，如果有噉嘅狀況之下得出嚟嘅投標結果咧，其實長遠嚟講對西九未必係有利嘅。咁喺呢個問題上，我好想問一問咧，即係譬如西九管理局或者政府咧，到底你哋點睇呢個問題？即係呢一個噉嘅投標嘅時間，或者而家揭標嘅時候就係第三季度。

561
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:39,050
唔該曬，唔該曬。

562
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,530
藝術家旅社。

563
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:08,850
如果冇嘅，噉就誒。

564
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:05,650
誒，大家對以上討論有冇問題？

565
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:23,610
好多謝誒！我諗呢個項目時間關係，我哋都討論到呢度啦，係嘛？咁好多謝誒政府官員同埋西九管理局嘅同事。

566
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:18,680
至誒而至於原本喺討論時空一覽表上面建議喺六月會誒個誒六月嘅會議討論有關西九文化。

567
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:13,490
所以 we we have some confidence, but quite frankly, nobody has a crystal ball. We just have confidence in the future of Hong Kong, and that's what this is really all about.

568
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:43,540
Expect us to have confidence. Hong Kong will be back stronger, better, even more prepared than we are today because of the experience we've been through. So we believe that actually this is.

569
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:36,970
斜洞公寓嘅最新發展嘅項目咧，當局表示，由於喺二零一八年六月十一號會議上邊咧，就該項目已經作出彙報，因此建議現時無需再錯出彙報啦。噉樣誒，而家冇其他事項會議結束，多謝。

570
02:04:43,900 --> 02:05:01,820
二零年六月一號下誒下午四點三十分至六點三十分舉行。以下係兩項討論嘅議題：第一，西九文化區計劃嘅最新財務狀況；第二，M家同埋香港故宮博物館發展嘅最新進展。

571
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:33,280
We feel that this is a long-term project. Anyone who's going to bid will have the long view. They won't be looking at today or tomorrow, even next year. They'll be looking at what is the prospect for Hong Kong in five years' time when the exhibition centre comes online, the hotel and offices. And in that context, we have to have confidence. I believe everybody would expect

572
02:03:43,820 --> 02:04:03,830
There is no good time or bad time to do a tender of this nature, but it's not going to affect marginally the the level of tender interest. And I would add to that that in fact we have been contacted by some of those parties that are interested in tender to say we are still very interested in this project.

573
02:04:23,890 --> 02:04:43,900
咁跟住議程咧就嘅第六項其他事項，喺二零二零年六月一號舉行下一次會議㗎。噉我想提醒委員咧，聯合小組委員會下一次會議咧，亦都即係聯合小組委員會喺本屆立法會已經編定咗嘅最後一次會議。咁喺頭先講啦，喺二零二。
