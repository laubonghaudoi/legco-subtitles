1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,000
立法會主席。

2
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,910
嘅誒國際協議嘅。

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,660
會議恢復，黃碧雲議員。

4
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,480
咁喺技術上邊作出咗一啲修訂。

5
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,020
咁本來咧，我哋誒討論緊嘅呢條嘅誒。

6
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,480
係可以直接提述，不時更改或修訂。

7
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,570
呢條條例草案嘅第一至十二條嘅納入嘅問題嘅。

8
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:48,820
誒同埋第十二條，咁呢個咧係我哋最關注嘅，因為咧我哋見到咧係誒第十條。

9
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:58,670
第十條咧係修訂咧原來條例嘅第二十七條，係定明根據條例訂立嘅規例啦。

10
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:16,080
咁關於關於呢度咧，其實係誒改變咗我哋嗰個嘅誒立法嘅方式。

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:36,320
條例草案都係咧係更新翻咧係根據誒國際雜裝箱安全公約，已經更新咗嘅一啲誒關貨櫃嘅一啲誒安全嘅一啲標準。

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:10,530
主席誒，今日咧就係我哋處理緊二零一九年嘅運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案。咁咧，剛才二讀嘅時候咧，我撳咗掣，但係咧好可惜，主席咧就誒劃咗線，就唔畀我哋發言啦。咁而家咧，我哋進入咗咧，就係要處理啦。

13
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:59,770
咁關於呢啲嘅誒修訂咧，技術層面嗰度咧，當然都係涉及到咧，就係誒，無論係關於嗰啲誒牌照嘅標記啦嚇，點樣堆放係安全啲啦，誒或者係涉及一啲誒得一道門嘅嗰啲誒改裝過嘅嗰啲嘅誒貨櫃。

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:19,810
嘅測試啊、安全等等，咁甚至係咧嗰個嘅喺牌照上邊貨櫃嗰啲嘅標記嘅尺寸單位嘅一啲改動咧，係誒包括以質量同埋誒嚟代替重量等等嘅詞匯。嗱，關於呢啲噉樣嘅技術嘅誒細節嘅修訂咧，咁其實。

15
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:39,820
我哋跟翻呢個國際嘅嗰個標準去更新翻咧，其實我哋係唔反對嘅。咁但係點解即係民主黨咧，我哋都冇辦法支持二讀同埋誒納入咧？噉我覺得咧最重要咧就係咧呢條條例裏邊咧，我哋覺得咧係第尤其是第十條、第十一條。

16
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:36,370
亦都係限制咗議員咧，第二咧係作出咧相關嘅審議同修訂嘅一個機會嘅嗱。本來誒，我相信誒，我哋睇翻咧誒，政府點解要咁做咧？可能咧就佢覺得噉樣咧就可以快啲，而過去咧的確。

17
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,890
嘅權力。

18
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,870
咁咧就。

19
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,220
係將公約嘅要求咧，係納入法例嘅。

20
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,800
誒，我哋將呢啲法例嘅修訂。

21
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,360
佢咧只需要咧係透過喺獻報嗰度看燈。

22
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,690
而根據而家呢一個嘅納入嘅第第十至十二條咧。

23
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,480
係轉移去畀海事處嘅處長去執行嘅。

24
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,950
咁但係過去拖得慢，我哋以後政府而家就想快馬加鞭，咁但係呢個快馬加鞭嘅方式咧？

25
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:50,370
就透過第十條嘅呢個修訂咧，民主黨就好有意見嘅，因為而家你呢一個嘅做法咧，就係講。

26
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:29,850
誒多項修訂中咧，我哋係廢除咗現有條例嘅附表，就改為以合符公約嘅負則係去取代。

27
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:22,580
佢係會廢除條例下嘅附表而賦權海事處處長，為咗實施適用於香港嘅國際雜裝箱安全公約嘅任何修訂，將來嘅任何修訂。

28
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:32,640
咁有啲咧係二零一三年就已經通過咗㗎，我哋到而家又滯後咗七年。咁過去滯後咗咁耐，我唔知啊，即係究竟係政府究竟係運房局嘅問題啊，定還是係誒誒咩問題？我哋係要擺咗咁耐先至去更新。

29
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:56,380
學咧，我哋見到咧，政府喺處理點樣更新國際啊，就住啊公約咧，佢哋國際海事組組織提出一啲嘅決議，而我哋冇辦法咧，好適時噉樣咧，盡快修定。咁過去咧嗰個嘅誒法例誒，想同國際接。

30
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:16,390
計咧誒接軌咧係積壓同埋滯後得好多年嘅。咁其實咧喺議讀嘅時候都有，我都聽到好多議員都講咗啦。咁有啲咧即係其實二零一零年嘅時候咧誒國際嗰邊咧都係出咗一啲嘅誒修訂更新，但係我哋都滯後咗成十年啦，而家先嚟搞噉。

31
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:14,900
國際海事組織因為佢哋咧係不時會更新呢個工作嘅技術要求，咁所以咧呢條條例草案咧誒特別係第十條開始啦嚇，要廢除原有嘅一啲嘅誒誒條例啦嚇，咁咧就會用以後咧就會用直接提述嘅方式係。

32
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:50,420
咁呢一個即係市民或者唔係好明點樣，我哋嚇即係呢啲技術嘅嘢，貨櫃安全嘅嘢都要反對咧。噉係咪我哋即係誒反對派就咩都去反對？噉我相信一定要講得好清楚。我哋反對咧，特別係民主黨，我哋提出咧就係話，我哋係唔贊成咧。

33
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,250
誒議員。

34
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,260
咁嗰個問題係邊度咧？

35
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,290
咁意思即係話咧。

36
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,870
審議同埋修訂法例嘅權力咧。

37
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,710
立法會議員嘅立法權。

38
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,040
嗱，其實如果涉及一啲技術性嘅修訂，

39
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,230
係可以睇一睇啊！嗰條誒法例嘅相關嘅所謂技術性嘅修訂。

40
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,240
你唔會侵犯咗議員嘅立法權，因為根據基本法，立法權係喺我哋嗰度嘅。

41
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,320
包括我哋審議法例嚇，甚至提出修訂。

42
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,160
嘅命令就可以咧，係直接修訂呢條條例嗰個嘅啊負責㗎啦。

43
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:23,230
噉你而家啊攞咗去交咗畀海事處，咁嗰個問題就係話你要解釋點解你要奪去立法會？

44
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:38,030
你話你你話嘅原因就啊，因為國際咧嗰啲公約係不時會改動，但係不時到幾個frequency係幾多啊？副局長。

45
00:06:50,280 --> 00:07:00,930
嘅權力咧都係被剝奪咗㗎啦，而呢個立法權就係轉移咗，係去到行政機關海事處處長嗰度。

46
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:24,820
點解政府唔係話啊？將呢啲噉嘅技術性嘅修訂係不時可能國際公約會有改動，係將佢由主體法例嗰度抽出嚟擺落去附表，繼續係將佢用附表嘅形式。你唔叫佢附表，你叫佢附則都冇問題。

47
00:07:51,760 --> 00:08:09,250
咁所以點解我哋唔用呢個方式係將呢啲有可能成日會誒變嘅所謂技術嘅嘢擺喺嗰個附表嗰度，從主體法例嗰度抽出嚟？你只不過係做緊一個結構性嘅改動，但係你就唔會做侵權。

48
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,300
架。

49
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,230
水銀。

50
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,290
米裏邊含嘅。

51
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,730
噉我哋立法會收工都得啦。

52
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,930
唔會話排曬長龍，搞到我哋立法會應付唔到嘅。

53
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,430
嚇！咁當然仲有一啲未做㗎水濱未做好啦，嚇！

54
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,860
然後咧，又交畀水務處處長搞掂佢。

55
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,440
嗰啲嘅標準，我哋都透過附屬法例嘅修訂更新咗㗎。

56
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:45,570
係咪個個月都改啊？我相信唔係啦，係嘛？你一年改兩次都好勁啦。你可能幾年先改一次。

57
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:25,150
如果你咁得，咁以後食物安全嗰啲又得唔得？係咪就交畀食環署食安專員搞掂佢，授權佢？

58
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:30,900
啊！因為英國標準、澳洲標準可能佢哋會更新，噉我哋咪做透過嗰個水務設施修訂條例去更新咗咯。

59
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:36,430
水務設施以後嗰啲水泵、以後嗰啲水喉、水龍頭嗰啲標準更改，係咪又唔使翻嚟立法會？

60
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:20,280
嚇，因為源水事件，我哋要嗰啲供水部件咧，要留意佢嘅金屬成分、重金屬有冇超越過嗰個限度？嚇，啲鉛會點啊？鉛啊點啊？鎘啊點啊？鋁啊點啊？

61
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:48,450
除咗食水安全，仲有食物安全，我亦都啱啱處理完嘅嚇，就係食物中參雜金屬啊嗰個嘅條例嘅修訂。以前我哋對於鉛食物中含有嘅鉛。

62
00:08:51,490 --> 00:09:07,310
咁所以你將佢喺結構上邊攞翻出嚟，你到時要修訂嘅時候，咪好似我哋我哋做好多附屬法例嘅修訂嘅喎嚇。啱啱嚇，即係我最呢一屆立法會，我先處理嗰個食水安全嘅修訂。

63
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:14,670
咁所以點解你而家講緊嘅呢啲貨櫃嘅安全相關嘅技術細節嘅修訂，又要全部掃曬去海事處嗰度，由處長以後發版，唔使翻嚟經立法會問我哋咧？

64
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:45,930
咁日後如果你要更新嘅時候，我哋一路做好多啦嚇。如果涉及啲技術性嘅修訂，屬於附屬法例，附屬法例仍然咧，政府係可以提出修訂嘅，並且用先定立後審議啊negative rating嘅方式，仍然係會有機會畀議員翻過嚟咧，係。

65
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,420
係違反基本法。

66
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,360
食物安全又係噉。

67
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,850
唔使做啦，係咪啊？

68
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,600
水又係噉樣樣。

69
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,650
你而家噉樣嘅做法咧？

70
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,140
呢個就係問題所在咯。

71
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,570
然後不斷助大行政機關嘅權力。

72
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,550
你行政機關攬曬啲嘢上身啦，係咪啊？

73
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,340
但係我又唔見你攬曬啲嘢上身，你做得嘢好有效率喎。

74
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,500
如果你可以畀海事處咁做嘅呢條條例咁做嘅。

75
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,200
點解你哋嗰啲嘢全部都拖咗十幾廿年先至嚟更新啊？

76
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,680
我哋頭先處理咗嗰啲食物中嘅重金屬，但係仲有好多有毒物質嘅。

77
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,260
定用英文用法文，我都覺得呢啲唔係好重要嘅嘢嚟嘅，但係重要嘅就係。

78
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,730
我唔知以後嗰啲食物安全嘅把關係咪由立法會度唔使上嚟問我哋。

79
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,890
呢條法例又開一個好壞嘅先例，就係不斷削弱立法機關嘅權力。

80
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,670
誒。

81
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,880
一路以嚟嗰個傳統先。

82
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,970
你原來連中文版本都冇嘅。

83
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,870
附例咧，係連中文版本都冇。

84
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,120
咁點解你而家上到嚟立法，到到我哋而家就嚟要三讀啦？

85
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,350
你都未有一個翻譯嘅文本擺上嚟，呢個係咪又顛覆咗、破壞咗我哋？

86
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:24,460
啊！唔係跟埋佢嘅，亦都唔係擺喺條條例嗰度畀議員審議嘅。

87
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,650
雙語立法嘅準則底下，你而家連一條中文嘅呢條則例？

88
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:49,480
你話啊，授權海事處處長處理咗佢就算啦，仲有你取替咗原來嘅附表之後加嘅呢一個嘅。

89
00:13:52,370 --> 00:14:01,340
係咪從事所有呢個貨運行業嘅人，全部都識睇英文，或者佢哋全部都唔識睇中文，所以你就連中文都冇？

90
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:36,430
噉你又仲衰過舊嗰份？舊嗰份都仲有中英對照喎，我哋仲可以睇清楚翻譯有冇錯誤啊，諸如此類。但係而家你喺香港特別行政區嘅立法會。

91
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:10,810
你立咗一條嘅條例，將國際嘅嗰個嘅公約嘅規則擺咗落去，你取消咗原來，我哋原來反而嗰個附表裏邊有中英對照喎，我哋雙語㗎嘛立法。

92
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:40,940
然後咧，透過附屬法例嘅修訂，我哋有法案委員會可以去審議，期間係引起公眾嘅討論同關注，令到行業嘅人知道、市民知道，而唔係好似你今次噉樣樣靜雞雞。

93
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:20,000
嗱，呢啲係我覺得咧係政府係要出嚟解釋話翻畀我哋聽點解咧？你係要做呢一樣嘢嘅。如果你話擺落附屬法例，其實我哋有好多附屬法例。頭先我講個食物安全、食水安全，甚至限奶令啊，自由黨好關心嘅嗰啲。

94
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:29,710
因為你侵犯咗立法會議員審議同修訂法案嘅權力，係因為呢個原因我哋要反你啊嘛！我唔係話要同你反温多啊，嚇，即係嗰啲一個門嘅貨櫃應該點樣測試、點樣安全，你嗰啲噉樣貼嗰啲嘅標籤嚇，用中文啦，同。

95
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:24,970
黃曲黴素啦，仲有好多有毒嘅物質嚇，喺嗰啲食油啊，喺好多食物裏邊出現嘅。而家都我都要喺一路督促緊政府要做做好佢嘅。噉佢起碼話六號開始再嚟諮詢全港諮詢，諮詢完諮詢完翻翻嚟立法會事務委員會討論。

96
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:40,290
喂，嗰啲我哋都係要修定㗎嘛附屬法例，點解你唔將佢變成一個附屬法例咧？我唔相信你嗰個頻度咧嚇頻密嘅程度要修定呢附屬法例係多到咧立法會係或者政府係應付唔到嘅，所以你不如將所有嘅權推曬過去畀海事處處長去。

97
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
吳孟靜議員。

98
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,960
係剝奪咗立法會議員。

99
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,990
personal considerations accordingly.

100
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,180
relating to the manufacture.

101
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,420
shows us that there are two sets of purposes.

102
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,870
，comma，use and examination of freight containers.

103
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:41,090
話轉移好，剝奪都好，總之你係侵犯咗立法會嘅立法權，所以為此咧，民主黨係冇辦法支持呢一個納入嘅。

104
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,710
啊！將過去我哋滯後咗嘅嘢，技術上邊修訂做翻好佢，但係我亦都係非常之不滿政府噉樣嘅做法。

105
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:53,580
The word manufacture was never mentioned in the original presentation by the bureau.

106
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:53,360
The first one is to standardise, according to universal convention, the requirements for testing and inspecting containers.

107
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:10,360
testing and inspecting, and a second is to prescribe uniform procedures of such containers maintenance and the control of safe transportation.

108
00:14:40,290 --> 00:15:00,300
做啦噉，連佢做唔做，我哋都唔知。個之後係嘛，佢都唔使相翻嚟向我哋報告嘅咯。刊登咗欠報就算嘅咯。咁會唔會入邊有啲嘢會唔合理或者唔適合香港嘅咧？我哋都冇機會去討論啦。咁所以一方面，我係好歡迎你去更新呢啲嘢。

109
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:32,360
修定法例、嚇審議法例嘅權力，係削弱立法權，助大呢個行政機關嘅權力。我哋係應該有一個足夠嘅三權分立、監察制衡。但係而家咧，呢一個嘅權係全部咧係轉移嚇，你話。

110
00:15:50,330 --> 00:16:10,340
We are conducting consideration by committee of the whole council over clauses one to twelve as the standing part of the bill. Now, this bill being the Freight Containers Safety Amendment Bill, 2019, and I'll tell my my

111
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:34,770
Now this bill is certainly ceremonial, and it's fairly straightforward. And of course, there are no smoke and mirrors. But then, if you look at the actual purpose of the bill, the original Legislative Council brief it tells.

112
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:31,280
So that's that sounds all fine, except if you look at the bill itself, the introduction says this freight containers safety ordinance is to implement the latest requirements of the international convention for safe containers.

113
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,670
not really.

114
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,820
excuse me。

115
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,980
need the drink.

116
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,920
我諗。

117
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,360
我 thought somebody was saying something to me.

118
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,440
Another example is the word capacity.

119
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,930
Think it exists, and it also.

120
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,160
Now my previous queries involve.

121
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,710
In Chinese，could you tell them to just keep quiet？

122
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,300
It's now become, as far as this bill is concerned, ability.

123
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:42,010
doesn't look at the manufacturing sector, okay, that never mind. What I really

124
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:58,290
fairly misleading. It's unnecessary, and he couldn't care less. He chose to ignore the official in charge, and he certainly chooses to look the other way.

125
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:32,980
reminds one of the fact that our unemployment rate has been going up and up. It's reached almost the highest ever these days, and yet the government

126
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:14,230
And it tells you, in effect, has been stating a very sad fact, and that is there's no such manufacturing in Hong Kong. Do we manufacture containers in Hong Kong? I doubt it very much. I just don't.

127
00:18:45,530 --> 00:19:05,540
We should seriously lament. It's the fact that the officials simply failed to address all the concerns and previous earlier queries over the discrepancies in language between the Chinese and English versions.

128
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:45,850
the the huge discrepancy and probably might just lead to misunderstanding of certain terms and that is why the English word dimension would become foot and inch in Chinese that could be a

129
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,910
所以那ffect， now， why did you bother？

130
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,230
There's a line saying at in alphabetical order.

131
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,600
and I mentioned that yesterday as well, and that is the word mass.

132
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,380
Well, what are you sitting there for? I mean, this is very obstructive.

133
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,850
Thank you, and last but not least was what Elvin Yung was saying earlier.

134
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:39,650
the starting character, right? So this is a very unnecessarily confusing and misleading.

135
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:30,080
無議員請你繼續，各位議員請喺座位上邊係不要咧係製造聲浪，影響其他議員發言。無議員請你繼續。

136
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:11,700
Right? What about a mass at church, right? And how could you, in this context, when we're talking about freight containers, to simply translate it into a

137
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:27,380
呃，what is it called？quality and quantity？This is just so very odd. And specifically about the clauses in clause three bracket two.

138
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Is now quality and quantity in Chinese? That's very very odd. The word mass could mean so many things in English. What about mass demonstration?

139
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:10,340
In this case, to to count the number of strokes in Chinese characters, I I just do not see the the virtue of doing this, and as a result.

140
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:50,860
Well, when you talk about the alphabet, of course it's in English. But then the Chinese version says, please at in accordance with the number of strokes in Chinese characters.

141
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:30,630
It would be in different orders, the Chinese and English versions, because in English you would be following the A B C, the alphabet, but in Chinese it's all according to the numbers of lines in each character. I suppose the.

142
00:22:40,620 --> 00:23:00,630
Now, you would think the words are words, and what's the big deal about certain translations or some slight discrepancies? But they could be important. And don't you think I'm just being nitpicking? And don't you ever.

143
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:20,640
Come back to this legislature to ask this council to once again change certain language in certain ordinances that, because to the effect of or for the purpose of achieving uniformity.

144
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:40,650
now that's going to be very very absurd so this whole business about the language in this bill could prove ultimately an indictment on this government's sense of legal or linguistic correctness and I.

145
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:37,850
誒。

146
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,910
now the。

147
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,790
what I am

148
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,710
particular container is exempt from the new requirements.

149
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:35,700
代替使用該貨櫃，或準許他人。

150
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:21,180
Let me go to after clause four. Let me go to clause seven.

151
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:47,660
urge this administration, especially the judiciary, to seriously watch out.

152
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:34,930
provision clearly states that no structural modification has ever been made.

153
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:48,910
較為模煳的about是，how this confirmation that there's been no structural modification has ever been made，made。

154
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:36,840
Now, again, I actually asked questions over this particular clause, and I don't think I don't think I got a reply. It says this.

155
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:14,310
Human being, words constituting the form of a human being, suddenly appear in clause four. Where did this actually come from? So this is all very baffling, and

156
00:23:49,470 --> 00:24:09,480
Now, in Clause Four, there's another very curious difference between the Chinese and English versions. In English, Clause Four simply says repeal use all, and then substitute use the contained.

157
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:29,490
或，OK，They added the word the container only. But in Chinese, it's completely or fairly completely different. It says repeal the original wording of使用或準許and

158
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:56,530
Now I don't know where this Taiyan, this other other person, come from. I haven't got the original ordinance to make comparisons, and so this is very baffling. Why is it that in Chinese suddenly there's a huge

159
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,560
啊。

160
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,710
啊！唔該，主席。

161
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,350
本節最後一位議員發言，張超紅議員。

162
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:10,190
the the freight proprietors.

163
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,060
Grey's treatment is that the case? I I just don't know.

164
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,860
點子，我 have made。 I'm afraid I have to vote against this。 Thank you。

165
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:18,990
The declaration. Oh, nothing has been changed. It's as it is. So.

166
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:01,980
我誒唔用個口罩會比較方便啲，同埋都想向公眾解釋我唔戴口罩，因為我其實方源。

167
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:59,410
would be at the end of the day, and I have quoted not just when it comes to the bill. I have quoted not just discrepancies in the introduction. I have mentioned my

168
00:26:49,250 --> 00:27:04,310
how how do you get this confirmation at all? Do you need another certification, or you just check the word of the owner of the well or the

169
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:36,000
close seven. What I'm addressing now that certain containers which are old and hasn't been modified in any way could be exempted. Now based on all those

170
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:37,300
I mean, we will have marine officials checking all those the safety approval plates, right? And you just take their word for it. Is that it? There's no actual examination as a result. Is that

171
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:58,140
Review paragraph eight of mind. I mean, all these legal maze of wordings, but it basically says if the construction of and a container or the container, the container in question, right, of a container.

172
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:18,180
Was completed. The construction of this container was completed before the one st of July two thousand and fourteen, and no structural modification has ever been made to the container. And then this.

173
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:58,070
What we are talking about? Because marine officials checking at the containers, you don't expect SWAT teams or black helicopters swirling around to do the inspection. So what exactly do you?

174
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:18,080
do with this? Do you have an extra plate to confirm that this container is exempted from the new requirements because it's oldish? It's manufactured before that cut-off date and it enjoys this.

175
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:44,560
And I don't know if I could put my confidence and trust in our marine officials, because ever after our Lamma tragedy on October the first, two thousand and twelve, I just don't know how perfunctory the examinations.

176
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,030
問題不大嘅。

177
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,750
誒疑問。

178
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,770
誒，我會有一啲嘅。

179
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,780
我係有幾點嘅關注嘅。

180
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,100
兩仗都冇人，咁應該係安全嘅。

181
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,540
生效日期嘅定定條文，而

182
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,150
嘅提述咧，就去取代呢個重量嘅提述。

183
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,240
咁去定明咧，有啲貨櫃喺二零一四年七月一日之前。

184
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:06,810
咁至於條例誒草案嘅第七條嘅修訂，誒就係修訂呢個第十條。

185
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:41,010
以跟循公約嘅更改嘅，咁呢個就係同國際單位制一致啦。喺呢方面咧。

186
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:34,030
今次呢一個納入咧，當然即係我哋講緊都係一個將誒有關呢啲國際嘅裝箱嘅集集。

187
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:18,830
誒咁誒就住今次呢個二零一九年運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案，而家喺第一至到第十二條嘅納入咧。

188
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:27,540
咁另外誒草案第四條嘅修訂條例草誒第四條咧，係作出咗一啲文本嘅修訂。誒呢一個裏邊牽涉到咧，將嗰個質量。

189
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:59,040
同埋咧，我亦都想喺呢方面咧，係指出誒，我哋而家呢一條法例咧，可能同我哋有一啲相關嘅法例咧，係有所衝突嘅。誒喺呢個字眼上。

190
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:12,320
第三條咧就係修訂嗰個條例嘅第二條，廢除咗一啲定義同埋加入條例中咧使用嘅一啲定義，用去反映公約所用嘅最新用詞。呢啲我都覺得。

191
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:20,060
discomfort over the language business, and I have specifically mentioned clause four and well the adding of an extra human being kind of thing in in the wording and.

192
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:54,320
雙裝箱安全公約嗰度咧，一啲嘅新嘅標準都唔新啦。當然，我我第一節嘅時候喺恢復議讀都有提過咧，係遲咗七年同十年咧。然後根據個公約咧作出一啲誒安全標準同埋程序嘅修訂。咁草案第一條當然就係列出咗個簡稱同埋。

193
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,450
七月一號。

194
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,240
完成呢個建造。

195
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,790
修正咗嘅一啲國際協議啦。

196
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,620
咁呢點我自己本身就唔係話。

197
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,720
係有一啲誒擔心，因為噉樣樣可能會。

198
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,880
所謂豁免期咧，就定咗喺二零一四年嘅七月一號之前。

199
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:02,190
我之前嘅同事亦都有提出，佢哋對於呢種直接提述嘅方式咧。

200
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:39,140
啊！正如我有啲同事都有較早時候咧提出咗，即係點解要用二零一四？

201
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:23,770
不過喺呢度咧都有一啲其他嘅考慮，我一陣間會再誒比較詳細咁去解釋。

202
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:15,460
令到我哋喺立法會咧，喪失咗一啲誒修訂嘅誒機會。

203
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:33,220
至於條例嘅第廿七條咧，係賦權我哋運輸同房屋局局長，根據條例咧係訂立一啲規則。

204
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:29,260
太關注嘅，我我覺得喺個邏輯上，一啲國際嘅協議，既然人哋即係我哋亦都認同咗一種嘅。

205
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:09,520
誒而二零一四年生效，咁所以即係當然喺個法例嘅邏輯上咧，我哋就跟隨公約嘅生效日期咧，就將呢一個誒。

206
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:32,240
而又未曾經過結構性嘅改裝嘅話咧，呢個新規定係唔適用於固定裝置喺呢個貨櫃上面有效嘅安全合格牌照。呢方面我亦都會提出一啲質疑。

207
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:58,030
喺呢方面，我反而就唔係太覺得嗰個誒日期有所謂有所爭議。我明白嗰個背後嘅邏輯，就係因為呢個公約咧，就其中一個決定咧，都係當年啦，二零一三年所作出。

208
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:53,520
咁草案嘅第十條修訂咧，係即係就係修訂呢條咧，係用明文規定咧呢啲嘅規例係可以採用直接提述嘅方式，而直接提述嘅方式咧係會當然係經不時修改或者誒要即係根據。

209
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,070
嗱，我分翻去誒。

210
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,980
咁所以事實上的確係兩件事。

211
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,450
我哋將質量取代重量。

212
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,450
咁所以喺呢一點咧，我都係覺得係要誒表示有啲關注。

213
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:19,720
誒而目前個條例嘅附表一係列明貨櫃結構安全同埋測試嘅規定嘅。

214
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:53,640
而草案嘅第十二條係以一個新定嘅附表二去取代條例而家嘅附表二。

215
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:16,880
係一個跟隨國際嘅量度嘅單位，亦都係跟隨個做法。呢點咧本身係冇意義嘅。

216
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:18,460
咁喺呢方面咧，其實當然亦都係會同我頭先講嘅嗰個二零一四年七月一號之前。

217
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:41,230
草案第四條，佢係修訂條例草案第四條咧，就係以質量去取代重量呢一個提述。

218
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:29,100
完成嘅完成建造嘅一啲貨櫃係豁免咗呢一種嘅誒要求咧，係同樣我會表達一啲關注。

219
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:45,320
係以直接嘅提述公約咧，係附則二嗰度嘅。咁同樣咧，呢個都係用一個誒直接提述嘅方式。我嘅關注咧就唔再重複啦。

220
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:33,510
咁因應呢啲附表嘅廢除咧，我哋今次呢個草案嘅第五、六、八同埋九條咧，就係分別修訂咗條例嘅第五、六、十A同埋第十四條。

221
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:09,170
就住安全合格牌照嘅標記同埋固定裝置嘅最新規定，幫當然係包括一啲堆碼同埋推拉能力有限嘅貨櫃嘅牌照嘅額外標記嘅規定咧，係訂立條文。

222
00:34:49,740 --> 00:35:06,360
誒都要有啲誒靈活，而唔能夠即係完全誒照噉樣照抄啦。因為有時喺誒適用翻喺本地嘅法例上面咧，的確係有啲字眼咧係需要有一啲修訂。

223
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:49,550
字眼噉，我哋喺納入即係本地嘅法例嘅時候，或者一啲附屬法例咧，其實係越貼近嗰個國際嘅協議係越好嘅，無論喺字眼上或者喺行文上。不過，的確即係喺個所謂直接提述個方式咧。

224
00:36:41,510 --> 00:37:01,520
就住呢個本身質量同重量嘅定義咧，我唔再重複啦。因為頭先楊嶽橋議員都講得好清楚，即係佢就輕輕同我哋上咗一堂中學嘅物理課啦，即係講緊質量同重量嘅分別，甚至嗰個量度單位亦都唔同。

225
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,390
但係。

226
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,380
三六九。

227
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,730
即係英文係呢個係誒cap。

228
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,410
誒，佢亦都用一個總重量嘅概念。

229
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,730
運載貨物及油類燃料規例。

230
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,500
佢講嘅貨櫃嗰個裝載。

231
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,180
而呢一個規例本身用嘅咧，就係重量。

232
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,770
佢裏邊其實呢條規例經修訂，已經喺二零一六年七月一號生效。

233
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,210
去描述呢啲貨櫃係誒用乜嘢形式去驗證？

234
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,740
咁喺呢度咧，係牽涉到喺三六九A.V章裏邊咧。

235
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:11,680
咁喺呢個第誒三六九A.V章嘅第三條。

236
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:25,310
但係喺我哋嘅經二零一六年修訂咗嘅雙船闊湖安全。

237
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:47,690
我哋而家呢條法例咧，我哋呢個草案咧，就正正係要將質量去取代重量。

238
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:23,280
三A條中咧，呢個規例咧係講緊裏邊係有關一啲總重量，需要用一啲方式去驗證。

239
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:47,050
AV merchants shipping in bracket safety in bracket carriage of cargoes and oil fuel regulation呢一條嘅規例咧。

240
00:37:53,050 --> 00:38:05,040
噉佢個規例嘅第三尾條咧，係將誒《國際海上人命安全公約》第六章第二條嘅規例嘅修訂咧，係納入其中。

241
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,780
修訂，如果唔係嘅話咧？

242
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,900
其實係有一個衝突，喺個字眼上係有一個衝突。

243
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,020
噉我擔心到咧，喺今次我哋修定咗呢條法例之後。

244
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,200
就我擔心呢一個嘅矛盾咧，就會繼續存在。

245
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,530
佢哋嗰個第四條嗰個修訂咧，我係誒表達關注。

246
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,380
咁呢一個係即係我暫時喺嗰個誒。

247
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,380
以致到咧，我哋喺執法嘅時候咧，就會出現一啲困難嘅。

248
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,200
但係佢係真係有一個好具體嘅程序嘅喺呢個誒規例裏邊。

249
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:05,230
同埋嗰個貨櫃嘅安全合格牌照顯示嘅最大嘅總重量咧。

250
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:35,190
咁個公眾或者相關嘅公司或者係人員咧，佢就可能會出現一種誒混亂。

251
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:24,360
咁亦都牽涉到嗰個誒貨櫃嘅皮質量啦，嗰個稱量啦，誒質量啦，同埋個總重量。

252
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:25,850
我哋如果同另外一條法例咧係出現一個衝突嘅時候咧，究竟當我哋要行使個或者執法嘅時候？

253
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:48,210
即係究竟係跟質量定係重量？因為即係我唔再重複啦，兩個係唔同嘅概念，亦都係用唔同嘅方式去量度。嗱喺嗰個。

254
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:40,200
咁呢啲概念如果唔搞清楚，同埋如果唔分得誒，即係一嗰個做法同埋嗰個喺個法例上面缺乏一個一致性嘅時候咧，我就擔心到咧，即係將來就會出現好多嘅爭拗啊！

255
00:39:48,610 --> 00:40:07,730
誒三六九A.V.將即係商船安全運貨誒運載貨物嘅規例裏邊咧，佢講得好清楚嘅，就住個總重量嘅一啲誒誒驗證嘅方式咧，係有兩種啊！我唔詳細誒誒表述啦喺呢度。

256
00:40:40,510 --> 00:41:00,520
咁所以呢一點咧，我唔知道誒，阿副局長一間會唔會都嘗試解釋一下？誒，你係咪會排緊隊就住嚟緊誒剩翻落嚟嘅立法時間唔係好多咧？你會連呢一個雙船安全運載貨物規例咧，都作出一啲相關嘅。

257
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,030
呢個係。

258
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,960
七條嘅修訂咧。

259
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,970
都係我哋嘅親肚娘。

260
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,050
而去到第。

261
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,710
即係講緊誒，定嗰個豁免個日期。

262
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,090
安全嘅標誌咧，已經係轉咗位置。

263
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,940
其實有幾多係二零一四年七月一號之前製造？

264
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,710
咁呢度一千八百幾萬個嘅貨櫃咧。

265
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,790
我哋就有一千八百三十萬個標準貨櫃。

266
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,930
當然已經大幅誒即係下跌啦。喺二零一四年，我哋有二千幾萬個嘅。

267
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:41,980
喺呢度咧，我係覺得誒有出現咗一啲嘅問題。

268
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:49,870
嗱，我哋喺呢一條法例喺國際公約生效之後咧，已經一段時間啦，大大話話都六年以上。

269
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:03,650
咁究竟我哋係講緊豁免咗幾多咧？我唔知道政府當局有冇做過一啲研究或者統計。

270
00:42:50,180 --> 00:43:00,060
咁好多嘅貨櫃，因為佢其他國家人哋已經立咗法，好快已經生效，以致到啲貨櫃嚟嘅時候咧，其實佢嗰個。

271
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:53,310
嗱，當你豁免咗嗰啲喺二零一四年七月一號之前完成咗個誒建造嘅呢啲嘅貨櫃。

272
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:15,620
係去睇下而家我哋誒，譬如過去呢一年，我哋嘅吞吐嘅貨櫃，即係就算以二零一九年。

273
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,150
主席。

274
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,880
等等。

275
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,340
當佢嘅。

276
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,600
法定人數已夠，會議恢復，局長。

277
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,560
感謝剛才各委員對條例草案嘅關注同埋意見。

278
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,530
黃碧雲議員，黃碧雲議員要求點算法定人數？

279
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,670
佢哋最近做咗個研究咧，發覺八成嘅人咧係有腰痛。

280
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:22,570
即係點樣去操作呢啲嘅誒貨櫃？因為我哋好清楚咧，知道。

281
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:03,690
佢哋往往係要長時間四十五度噉樣彎腰去睇，即係認住每一個貨櫃嗰啲嘅標誌。

282
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:54,040
你知唔知佢哋喺個吊機度或者喺個龍門架操作嘅時候，佢哋點樣樣去睇呢啲貨櫃嘅標誌咧？

283
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:16,250
咁陸續咧，我哋嘅操作人員咧，其實佢喺面對呢啲貨櫃嘅時候，佢已經開始習慣咗一個新嘅位置去睇呢啲嘅。

284
00:44:48,970 --> 00:45:03,400
去擺好個標誌啊嘛！我我留翻下一下一三讀先再講。時間到啦，本節嘅辯論環節已經結束。誒，我會請運輸及房屋局局長回應議員嘅提問，局長。

285
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:43,580
誒有清楚嘅標誌嘅時候咧，佢係處理呢啲貨櫃嘅方式係唔同。我唔知道啊啊副局長或者我哋相關嘅官員咧，喺修訂呢啲條例嘅時候，尤其是畀呢個豁免咧，有冇去問過嗰啲貨櫃碼頭或者貨櫃操作嘅人員？

286
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:23,980
係一個，如果你落咗呢個豁免，以致到呢啲舊嘅貨櫃係永遠都唔使去改翻嗰個標誌嘅位置嘅時候咧，佢哋又要去嘗試睇邊啲係可能係新嘅貨櫃，邊啲可能係舊嘅貨櫃。你知佢哋呢一行咧？

287
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:48,970
追間盤突出啊！啊，代主席誒，即係我都有啦嚇，即係第四五節嗰個咧，係佢哋行裏邊最常傾偈、最大嘅困難。突然，我諗起離題啦。唔係我講緊個佢嘅闊面啊！二零一四年七月一號之前製造嘅貨櫃係可以闊面。

288
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:36,850
正如我喺二讀恢復，我喺恢復二讀嘅時候，條例草案嘅時候發言指出，條例草案只在將國際海事組織、國際雜裝箱安全公約中有關貨櫃嘅裝卸、堆放和運輸安全，以及對貨櫃結構和規格嘅最新要求納入運貨。

289
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:05,630
疫情。

290
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,360
開幾票？

291
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,020
開始表決。

292
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,580
贊成嘅請舉手。

293
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,430
石裏謙言。

294
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,030
楊國強議員要求記名點票，點票鐘響五分鐘。

295
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:06,930
林卓廷議員要求記名點票，表決中響五分鐘。

296
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,760
懇請各委員支持通過條例草案。我緊接陳詞，多謝主席。

297
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:02,390
我現在向各位提出嘅代決議題係，秘書已讀出嘅條文納入本條例草案，贊成嘅請舉手。

298
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:41,560
全體委員會已經完成審議《二零一九年運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案》所有程序，現在回覆為立法會運輸及房屋局局長。

299
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:28,450
請核對所在表決，有冇問題？然後停止表決，顯示結果。出席係五十五位，有三十六位贊成，十八位反對。議題係獲得在席委員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。

300
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:52,070
《貨櫃安全條例》第五百零六章令到呢啲要求得以在本港實施。條例草案第七條中嘅豁免安排係按照公約嘅要求，所以呢項嘅法案純屬技術嘅性質。

301
00:55:52,670 --> 00:56:08,800
採用直接提述方式施行國際協議條文，只在本地法例中直接提述有關國際協議條文，使到該等條文適用於活當地。由於好多海事相關嘅國際協議均屬

302
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:29,130
技術性質，而所在要求均清晰同埋具體，並廣泛適用於全球嘅替藥方，以及只關乎某特定羣體嘅人士。因此，我哋實施海事相關國際要求嘅時候，喺頗多本地法例係採用直接提述方式。我強調直。

303
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:49,140
接提述方式並沒有削弱立法會權力，或者係繞過立法會。落實條例草案嘅建議，將有助保證貨櫃嘅裝卸、堆放同埋運輸安全，依個確保貨櫃結構同埋規格符合公約嘅最新要求，進一步保障海運嘅運輸安全。我。

304
01:02:44,800 --> 01:03:04,810
主席，我現在向立法會作出報告。二零一九年運貨貨櫃安全修訂條例草案無經修正已獲全體委員會通過，我動議本會採納此報告的議案。現在嘅代議題係局長嘅議案，予以通過。現在提出上述嘅代議。

305
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:39,370
三讀，二零一九年。

306
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:25,100
請核對所作嘅表決，如果冇問題，然後停止表決，顯示結果。

307
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:36,450
出席嘅五十五位，有三十六位贊成，十八位反對。議題係獲得在席委議員以過半數贊成，我宣佈議案獲得通過。
