We are mindful that the Honorable Ho Chi Phong launched an appeal against conviction, HCMa306.

11
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:46,680
However, the honourable Denis Quirk and I, as members of the investigation committee, cannot fully agree with the content of the report.

12
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:07,640
We accordingly prepared a minority report to express our view and observations, which differ from the report submitted by the investigation committee in certain respects.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:38,450
Honourable Mrs Regina Ip moved a motion under the rules of procedure 49B in bracket 1A, the ROP, to sanction Honourable Ho Chee Fung under Basic Law Article 79 in bracket 7.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:57,400

我們是認為，的司法獨立原則必須被尊重。

21
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,760
We do not agree with the finding of investigation committee stated in paragraph 4.18 of the report.

22
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,100
We do not agree with the finding of investigation committee stated in paragraph 4.32 of the report.

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:10,260
We are of the view that although Miss Lung was upset during the material time of the incident and shortly after the incident.

24
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:26,110
We are of the view that this comment is irrelevant to the report. Thank you, Mr. President. 鄂俊賢議員就環境事務委員會。

25
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:53,530
We are of the view that it is difficult to draw even an observation or inference whether the mobile phone might contain sensitive internal information of the government.

26
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:51,330
The investigation committee should not publish its report before the appeal hearing in HCMa2306/2019 is heard and a decision is made.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:30,570
We cannot draw a clear conclusion whether Miss Lung burst into tears when reporting the incident to Mr Fu, while relying on Mr Fu's evidence alone, without any cooperating evidence from either Miss Lung or other witness.

28
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:15,950
We do not agree with the comment made by the investigation committee in paragraph 4.34 of the report, which stated, "IC is of the view that his acts were in fact more serious than acts of ramming, as stated in the sixth fact."
