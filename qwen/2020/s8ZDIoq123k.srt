1
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,220
啊！

2
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,380
好，通過。

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,140
咁而家請政府代表先簡介文件啦，唔該。

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,730
好，首先係歡迎政府代表出席呢次會議。

委員出席今日嘅工商事務委員會。

6
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,780
參與一帶一路建設，即係二是誒誒，代二事項嘅一覽表第二項。

7
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
firstly, the survey of companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong.

8
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:10,300
誒請委員按照會議室二嘅編排座位坐，因為一間禁制發言嘅。

9
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:21,520
咁誒，而家請政府官員入會議室。有議題問嘅，請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。

10
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,480
Mr. Chairman, thank you. I would like to provide members with some highlights of our two 2019 surveys.

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:14,120
以前嘅第四項，香港境外冇公司嘅駐港公司統計調查同埋初創企業統計調查結果。

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:38,310
議程嘅第二項，上次會議後發出嘅資料文件，喺上次會議後秘書處發出嘅資料文件已經列於議程上邊，請委員備悉。

13
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:25,860
咁以前嘅第一項咧係確認通過會議紀要。咁二零一九年十一月十九日嘅會議紀要已經發給各委員，秘書處亦都收唔到委員嘅建議修訂。請委員確認通過呢份會議紀要。

14
00:01:53,170 --> 00:02:11,720
政府當局提供咗討論文件係立法會文件CB括弧一三二九斜棟一九至二零括弧零三號文件，秘書處就有關嘅事項亦都移備咗背景資料。立法會文件CB括弧一三二九斜棟一九至二零括弧零四號文件。

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:58,740
以前嘅第三項，下次會議嘅日期同埋討論事項。二月份嘅例會將會喺二月十八號星期二下晝兩點半舉行。咁建議討論嘅事項咧係有兩項嘅，第一係香港科學園同埋工業村嘅最新發展，即係第二事項一覽表嘅第一項；第二係香港。

16
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:54,130
The two thousand and nineteen survey indicates the number of overseas and mainland companies in Hong Kong now exceeds nine thousand, and precisely nine thousand and forty, compared with eight thousand two hundred and twenty five in two thousand and seventeen. So that's an increase of nine nine percent over that two year period.

17
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,260
一 percent， compared to two thousand and seventeen.

18
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,110
whilst thirty four percent come from out Hong outside Hong Kong.

19
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:36,080
The U.S. mainland, UK and France are the top four sources of those entrepreneurs.

20
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,680
52% of respondents indicated their business plans remain unchanged in the coming three years.

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:04,010
The number of companies using Hong Kong for their regional headquarters also grew to 1,541, up 9.

22
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:47,080
The main sectors in the startup survey are fintech, followed by e-commerce, supply chain management and logistics, ICT and then design.

23
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:32,140
The paper sets out the top ten sources, but I'll just mention the top five. The mainland ranked first, followed by Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and then Singapore.

24
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:20,040
The total number of people employed by these companies reached 493,000, an increase of 11.3% compared to 2017.

25
00:03:48,700 --> 00:04:00,240
The survey noted the top three favourable factors were simple tax system and low tax rate, free flow of information and geographical location.

26
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:25,420
We continue to see entrepreneurs from around the world being attracted to Hong Kong. Fifty nine percent of startups are founders from Hong Kong. Seven percent Hong Kong returnees.

27
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:13,150
The number of people employed by those start-ups grew very significantly by ninety-seven point four percent to twelve thousand four hundred and seventy-eight again against two thousand and seventeen.

28
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:47,560
The companies continue to come from a diverse range of sectors, and the highest number in import-export trade, wholesale and retail, followed by financing and banking, and then professional, business and education services.

29
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:40,770
Whilst 23% said that they plan to expand their business in Hong Kong, of which 68% said they would recruit more staff, 51% expand the scope of existing business functions, and 36% develop new business functions.

30
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:17,560
The three least favourable factors were availability and cost of residential accommodation, availability and cost of business accommodation, and availability and cost of staff. And those are all in line with the issues that we hear from the companies that we work with at Invest Hong Kong.

31
00:04:41,510 --> 00:05:00,690
Turning now to the survey that we do on startups, the survey showed that a total of three thousand one hundred and eighty four startups operating in co work spaces, incubators and accelerators, and that's an increase of forty two eight over two thousand and seventeen.

32
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,570
和 Emerging Markets。

33
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,430
and indeed the development of the Guangdong Macao

34
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,330
those projects created more than six thousand jobs in the first year of operation or expansion.

35
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,210
2017 and 436 in 2018.

36
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,230
然而， fundamental and core strengths of Hong Kong remain very strong， and we hear this consistently from investors.

37
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,620
Hong Kong Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative continue to garner lots of interest from the companies that we're working with.

38
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:42,420
On the startup side, we'll continue to provide one-stop services to global startups and encourage them to use Hong Kong as a launchpad to grow their businesses.

39
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:52,150
作為田野work was conducted mainly during the period June to August, we would note that the survey findings have not fully reflected the latest developments in Hong Kong.

40
00:07:42,700 --> 00:08:01,500
所以，Ms. Chan， my colleagues and I be very happy to answer any questions or address any comments that your colleagues would like to make. Thank you. Correct. Thank you. 啊，而家係委員提問嘅時間。我建議係每人連問連答五分鐘啦，好嘛？咁誒，第一位係陳振英議員。

41
00:05:47,690 --> 00:06:07,700
So, maybe just to make some concluding remarks, the findings of the two surveys really show that Hong Kong continues to attract leading overseas and mainland companies as well as entrepreneurs from around the world to set up a wide range of leading and innovative businesses here in the city.

42
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:28,420
The findings are also borne out by the day-to-day work of Invest Hong Kong. Today, we've announced actually that in two thousand and nineteen, Invest Hong Kong assisted a record number of four hundred and eighty-seven overseas and mainland companies to set up or expand in Hong Kong. That's up from four hundred and two in.

43
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:30,910
In two thousand and twenty, we're going to be gearing up our efforts, both to target individual investors as well as engage potential investors through business seminars, marketing campaigns, participating and sponsoring in international events, as well as arranging investment promotion visits, both in traditional.

44
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:22,140
多謝主席。誒，第一個問題咧就係誒調查裏邊咧，就誒一九年六到八月咧，冇公司設於海外同埋內地嘅駐港公司咧，就有大約九千家啦。咁呢啲公司聘用嘅員工咧，就話高達四十九萬三千人嘅。咁誒，但係咧統計裏邊咧就冇講邊啲國家地區。

45
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:42,150
區嘅公司咧，聘用嘅員工最多。咁因為而家我哋啱啱公佈都失業率係誒輕微上升啦，但係誒保就業嘅角度咧，應該重點去一啲咧，即係傾斜我哋嘅宣傳力度咧，去一啲誒國家同地區，如果成立咗一啲公司喺香港可以請多啲人嘅，就會更加好。

46
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,880
所以，我們有那資訊。

47
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,470
係，請問政府邊位回答？

48
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,460
好唔該，誒第二位係郭佩凡議員。

49
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,480
誒或者可以喺會後咧，我哋再將具體嘅數字咧，可以畀翻立法會嚟到做參考嘅。

50
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,900
entry point， so depending upon the individual investor， we'll try and address the issues as up front as we can。

51
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:31,310
係啊，誒多謝主席。咁咧就誒呢個調查咧就係誒都算係暴亂嘅前期啦，即係六至八月期間進行嘅。

52
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:41,940
When we're out selling Hong Kong, we talk about all of those factors quite extensively in general terms, and then with individual companies very specifically about what Hong Kong can mean for them.

53
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:20,600
一啲支援措施夠唔夠啦？咁不利嘅因素可能係除咗成本之外，會唔會人才嘅供應誒充唔充足啊？噉樣噉，究竟局方會唔會做翻一啲誒針對初創企業嚟香港嘅一啲調查，令我哋知道咧點樣可以將來鼓勵更多初創企業落户喺香港咯？唔該，主席。

54
00:10:45,620 --> 00:11:04,310
It will start off with where they see the business opportunities, and that can be the opportunities in Hong Kong itself, the opportunities that they can tap into in the Greater Bay Area, or opportunities that they can tap into more widely across Asia, and for some of them, along the Belt and Road.

55
00:08:42,150 --> 00:09:02,160
啦，噉我想問咧，誒有冇呢一方面嘅數據可以畀我哋參考咧？噉樣樣。第二樣嘢咧就係誒，根據個調查都講啦，喺香港設立業務據點咧，不利因素咧其實全部都係同錢有關嘅，就係居所啦、供商業樓宇同埋員工嘅供應同支出，但係最

56
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:22,170
近咧誒啱啱有一個調查，就係誒二零二零全球財富及高端生活報告咧，就話香港係全球最貴嘅城市。噉我想話誒，即係話咧，其實不利因素呢三項咧係好難一下子改善嘅，因為我哋已經高踞喺噉嘅即係最貴嘅城市裏邊啦。咁加上近半年嗰個社會活，

57
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:42,180
動咧，亦都有誒不少嘅負面影響。噉我想問誒局方喺未來有咩方法繼續可以吸引一啲喺海外或者係內地嘅公司咧誒嚟香港經營咧？咁呢個係一個第二個大問題。第三個問題咧就誒個調查都列出咗初創企業有三千一百幾間過嚟啦，咁都請咗萬幾人。

58
00:09:42,180 --> 00:10:02,190
但係咧就誒調查就冇問點解呢啲初創企業嚟香港落户嘅咁誒，佢冇好似第一個調查咁講明哦係税制啊，或者係其他係係誒嚟港嘅主要因素不利嘅因素係咪成本咧？咁因為可能初創企業佢會關注嘅係創業嗰個生態環境啦。

59
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:45,620
Perhaps I could address the last point first, and then one of my colleagues can pick up the question on employees by sector. In terms of the factors that influence companies coming to Hong Kong, they are very varied indeed. So for each individual company.

60
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:24,600
In terms of our internal measure of what's motivating companies to invest in Hong Kong, we've begun to ask these questions of the companies where we're completing projects. So we're beginning to get a feel for how many companies are being swayed by various.

61
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,270
Mr. Phillips.

62
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,560
讓佢哋渡過呢段艱難嘅時期，繼續喺香港發展咧。唔該，主席。

63
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:19,240
Looking to the future, our pipeline remains reasonably robust. It softened a little bit, but it hasn't dropped dramatically.

64
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:09,410
Existing investors don't seem to be, according to our conversations, leaving the city at the moment. But many of them are looking at contingency plans, and they tell us that they are doing that.

65
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:34,140
所以我們繼續要工作，非常努力去跟進現有的和新投資者，解釋最新的情況在香港，和幫助解決公司有問題。

66
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:50,060
I'd also mention that we're very actively monitoring feedback from our teams in thirty locations around the world on a monthly basis, so we've got a feel for what the market is saying.

67
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:55,030
That they've put decisions on hold, others are taking a more wait and see approach, but we are also continuing to see some investors complete invest investments in the city. So it's a somewhat mixed picture.

68
00:11:42,220 --> 00:12:02,230
Cost obviously is a significant issue, whether it's premises or staff. But we also discuss with companies how they can mitigate the costs of market entry. For instance, setting up an office to begin with in co-working space can be relatively modest.

69
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:31,580
誒或者我都就住頭先提問嘅最先嘅問題，或者補充少少啦。咁其實喺誒舊年嗰個數字九千零四十間，即係海外公司而喺香港或者國內嘅公司喺香港有呢一個分公司嘅數字嚟講咧，其實最多咧，最多咧，如果以地方而言咧，就係國內嚟香港。

70
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:51,590
嘅公司咁跟住就係日本啦，就係誒美國啦、英國啦噉樣。咁而如果行業嚟到睇咧，正如喺呢份文件都講到咧，其實咧呢九千幾間公司咧，誒有超過四千間咧係從事呢個進出口貿易啦、批發同埋零售啦。其次就係有一千七百幾間咧係金融啦、銀行業。

71
00:12:51,590 --> 00:13:11,600
業啦，再跟住有千幾間咧，就係專業啊、商業啊、教育服務啊噉樣。咁其實進出口啊、批發啦、同埋零售同埋金融同埋銀行業咧，呢啲都係咧係僱用誒相當誒不少嘅即係僱員嘅。咁具體嘅數字咧，頭先問到咧，其實咧就喺個誒呢一個統計上面咧，我哋係有收集咗嘅。

72
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:51,600
咁當時咧，其實誒個誒結果似乎又唔係太差，但係咧就有十八個percent公司表示咧，就對未來個在港業務嘅發展就話未未確定啦。誒亦都有百分之三咧表示咧就會將香港部分或者全部業務中止或者遷嚟香港。咁誒文件裏邊咧，其實就

73
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:11,610
冇清晰就誒講嗰個誒原因嘅咁誒，其實我想了解咧，即係政府有冇係誒，即係特別去了解下誒呢類型嘅公司佢哋誒打算將業務即係撤出香港嘅誒原因係啊乜嘢啦？同誒呢幾個月嚟嘅即係六月至八月期間嘅一啲。

74
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:31,620
啲嘅香港嘅暴力衝突嘅事件有冇直接嘅關係？咁同埋誒誒，而家即係過咗咁多個月啦，即係誒暴亂未完全係停息停止曬嘅，噉就有冇跡象顯示對嚟緊？我哋呢一年即係喺呢啲嘅誒住港公司喺香港嘅發展嗰個。

75
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:51,630
個誒，無論佢哋睇個營商環境啊，或者未來嗰個發展有幾大嘅影響咧，誒會唔會有更加多嘅公司誒，即係暫停誒嚟港嘅計劃，又或者誒有打算撤離香港咧？咁咁對呢啲情況，誒當局有幾掌握，有啲乜嘢誒計劃打算？

76
00:14:51,630 --> 00:15:11,640
去做去誒誒進一步去誒提升翻投投資者對香港誒喺香港經營嘅誒信心同埋誒即係誒一啲咩宣傳嘅推廣計劃啦咁咁另外主席就誒我見到初創企業方邊咧就誒誒我自己認識嘅一啲嘅科。

77
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:31,650
科技界嘅創創企業咧，都話呢段時間咧，其實佢哋都面對好多唔同類型嘅經營困難嘅。其中最大一個困難咧，就係佢哋原本接觸嘅一啲嘅投資者，尤其係海外嘅投資者咧，都係話睇定啲先暫停一啲嘅投資嘅計劃，令到佢哋整個財政預算啊，或者成發展嘅計劃咧，誒都受到好大程度嘅。

78
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,240
降級。

79
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,140
Mr. Phillips。

80
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,590
喂，Mr. Phillips。

81
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,620
誒，下一位係楊樂喬爾。

82
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,020
sorry, I didn't quite catch the question.

83
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,650
認唔認同呢啲？

84
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,950
境外冇公司嘅駐港公司。

85
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,610
主席唔該，想請問阿處長咧。

86
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,670
但係，如果評級機構對香港，

87
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,100
噉係咪佢認為評級機構對香港嘅評級係可以置之不理咧？

88
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,540
儘管剛才署長就話，即係嗰個係一個相對少嘅影響。

89
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:30,680
relatively minor factors. They're much more interested in how do they generate revenue and how does that feed through to the bottom line.

90
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:56,060
會參考評級機構對香港嘅評級，佢同唔同意評級機構會佢哋對香港嘅評級，有可能會影響呢一啲投資者對香港嘅觀感，主席。

91
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:25,380
The seminar at Invest Hong Kong to share with the international community the different support packages that are available to them. So we're trying to raise the awareness of how they can tap into the support that the government's providing.

92
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:51,660
影響咁誒誒，除咗誒，譬如一啲政府嘅設施減租啊，又或者誒優化一啲誒中小企嘅借貸計劃之外咧，其實呢啲初創企業咧，可能更加需要政府其他方面嘅一啲嘅支援嘅喺呢一方面誒，政府有咩嘢嘅計劃去幫呢啲初創企業誒，即係？

93
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:18,520
To address the concerns of existing investors in Hong Kong, we very significantly increase our aftercare efforts. So engaging with companies both here and in their home countries to understand the situation and where we can to address any specific concerns that.

94
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:38,530
They have, I think no doubt the international image of Hong Kong has been seriously damaged, and the confidence certainly of some companies damaged as a consequence. In terms of companies that we're talking to who are considering investing in Hong Kong, some reports.

95
00:17:50,340 --> 00:18:10,350
In terms of startups and addressing the particular issues that they face, other parts of government have introduced a raft of support schemes which both international and local startups can tap into. And just last week, in fact, we have.

96
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:20,550
And certainly, investors will look at ratings. They'll look at surveys, but most of all, they will look at what business opportunities exist for them. So the the sort of generic issues, whether it's the surveys on the business environment or ratings, are I would say for most.

97
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,380
what if？

98
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,290
所以，what's your response?

99
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,510
所以，Mr. Phillips。

100
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,040
Could it be interpreted again? Sorry.

101
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,850
Perhaps I could speak in English. Thank you.

102
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,430
Would you, you know?

103
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,190
Their ratings of Hong Kong is they downgrading Hong Kong.

104
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,490
do you agree that the rating agencies' their ratings on Hong Kong

105
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,290
and they have a number of factors, they are all valid factors.

106
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,640
when you said they are of minor significance, when you answer my question a bit earlier.

107
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:26,560
Do you think the Hong Kong government could simply ignore the ratings, especially when they downgrade Hong Kong?

108
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:07,420
If you get to meet a potential investor, and he said, Mr. Phillips, I'm looking at Moody's or Standard and Poor.

109
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:57,670
But in terms of the ongoing business, the impact on cost of capital clearly this is important, and it's very important that we as Hong Kong address it. So my question, another question is a what if.

110
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:51,400
They pointed out that the rating agencies, they have very very valid reasons, especially regarding poor governance of the Hong Kong SAL.

111
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:34,850
Depending upon the nature of the business, we'll be sharing with them broader information that is relevant to the particular sector in which they operate, to provide a more holistic picture than just the rating.

112
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:45,500
no, I wasn't suggesting that whatsoever. clearly, when ratings go down, it has impact on costs of capital and so forth. but in terms of taking an investment decision, my point was that the ratings are not a major factor in the investment decision.

113
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,290
會，你做那？

114
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,020
你 agree with that?

115
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,230
agreed， and we do.

116
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,250
I think.

117
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,580
any concerns that they have.

118
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,510
咁誒，我想問誒，下一個。

119
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,410
就收禮事件造成咗好多問題發生。

120
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,780
但作為一員政府，你亦都有個義務，去。

121
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,320
pass a message to your superior, especially the secretary.

122
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,260
We consistently feedback any.

123
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:30,360
pass the clear message to those in charge that this is something what the investors are concerning, right?

124
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:28,570
feedback that we get from all of the companies that we're working with. I mentioned that we're getting each of our office to report back on a monthly basis. That feedback is shared upwards within the government, so we are sharing markets sentiment and feedback widely.

125
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:48,860
And would you stress to the secretary or those who are in charge that high degree of autonomy or the degree of autonomy is of very very high degree of significance when it comes to investors' confidence on Hong Kong?

126
00:22:52,530 --> 00:23:12,540
the autonomy of Hong Kong, the overall business climate in Hong Kong, the overall social climate in Hong Kong, the unrest, these are all important factors, and they're widely understood by senior echelons in the government. And companies will very openly express

127
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:53,220
好，下一位係姚思榮議員。誒，多謝主席。誒，睇翻有關嘅報告咧，就誒統計數字就話，舊年六到八月份做咗一啲有誒統計嘅工作啦嚇。噉啊，未反映到香港嘅實際情況嘅。我我都同意，因為誒舊年下半年開始。

128
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,420
第三個就係誒。

129
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,610
第第三個問題啦，係。

130
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,170
首先，如果我可以address the survey question。

131
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,460
The next survey will be undertaken at the same period this year.

132
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:46,050
and at that time we will see whether there have been any material shifts in what the companies report.

133
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:07,140
或者分佈誒，因為呢個內地關係嘅公司究竟有幾多？有冇方呢方面嘅統計咧？嚇，三個問題。Mr. Phillips。

134
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:31,030
In many ways, the survey is a little bit like a balance sheet. So, reports as at a particular date, and we do that on an annual basis. So we can look at the trends over the years.

135
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:35,880
方面，你哋會點處理咧？第二個問題就係誒有四十幾萬嘅員工喺誒，即係請咗香香港嘅誒，即係海外嘅員工個比例點樣？即係本地誒員工嘅比例同埋呢個海外員工嘅誒比例點樣？

136
00:26:48,960 --> 00:27:06,740
到税制上面嘅原因啦，當中又講到法治嘅原因啦，當中亦都講到咧地理上面誒嗰個原因咧，但係亦都咧，亦都有不少嘅企業咧，開嘅企業咧，亦都話畀你聽咧，佢選擇香港作為佢地區嘅總部或者分公司咧，其實咧亦都考慮到咧國內個龐大嘅市場咧。

137
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:24,640
調過嚟咧，就喺統計處幫我哋做呢個調查嘅時間咧，就冇去到咁具體，只不過咧係問啊，你請咗幾多人啊噉樣，所以就有呢個總數咧，就係呢一個誒嗰個四十九萬幾，但係當中係幾多佢自己派過嚟，而或者係請嘅香港咧，就冇入到咧咁深入嘅嚇。

138
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:19,850
誒調查準備幾時咧？呢個統計嚇，因為誒而家個數字一定係唔係準確㗎啦。咁誒，你哋政府會準備下一階段嘅統計呢個統計誒，包括咧增幅嘅變化啦，因為而家嘅變化一定同以往誒以後唔同㗎啦。另外投資取向嘅變化啦啊，咁呢方。

139
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:58,710
誒，我哋睇到嗱，內地嗰個就一千七百九廿九間啦嚇。咁其他嗰啲嘅國家，咁誒，佢因為香港嘅誒環境啊，誒或者法制啦嚇。咁但係佢哋因為因為香港係個窗口，對內地有直接嘅關係，而因為噉樣而喺香港設立誒總部或。

140
00:25:46,390 --> 00:26:06,400
on the question of local versus expatriate staff, that's something that I think we'll have to take away. But I'll pass on to Mr. Tang to supplement.誒就住外國嘅公司嚟咗香港之後，佢請嘅僱員當中幾多係香港本地人，或者係海外自己本身點？

141
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:48,960
第三第三個問題咧，就其實咧就誒，我哋都知道好多海外啲公司咧，就佢嚟香港咧，其實亦都主要就因為係國內嗰個商機嘅因素。噉我哋都有喺調查裏面咧，亦都有咧就問佢咁究竟香港對佢哋而言個吸引力喺邊度咧？咁當然啦，有好多嘅原因啦，當中有講。

142
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:27,030
嗱誒誒，主席，我覺得誒有啲數據咧，因為香港始終啊，即係作即係誒內地嘅南即係南南風窗嚟叫做嚇。咁如果呢方面嘅數據冇咧，就我覺得應該都應該做好啲嘅啊。咁使到大家係分析香港嗰個地理優勢啦，或者環境優勢嘅時候更加客觀啊。

143
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:47,040
咁即係可能只係強調本身嘅優勢，而忽略咗周邊嘅優勢對我哋嘅互動關係。我睇呢個數字應該做得好嘅。誒，另外你話本地員工同海外員工之間比例冇咧，我哋我都都都好奇怪，因為誒呢個係長期工作嚟嘅。咁一間海外公司或者內地公司喺香港開嘅時候，

144
00:27:47,130 --> 00:28:07,140
佢對香港本地就業，但係是直接幫助點樣咧？然後海外員工嚟香港嘅時候，佢哋對香港啦、房地產啊，或者香港嘅一啲嘅誒其他嘅誒，即係誒誒嗰啲開支嘅收入啊，都都有一定嘅參考價值。噉我覺得呢樣嘢誒有機會，我覺得你哋可以考慮啊，係咪去做呢方面嘅？

145
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,430
啊！我。

146
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,210
啊。

147
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,930
以上嘅問題兩個嚇，主席。Mister Phillips。

148
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,690
好，誒下一位係盧偉國議員。誒，多謝主席。

149
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:48,950
咧更多地選擇以香港作為佢哋地區總部嘅一個誒地點咧。

150
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:18,530
啊，咁亦都可以誒，説明咧，誒呢啲啊三地之間咧，就同埋香港嘅。

151
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:23,020
And the Belt and Road Initiative is also something that we're tracking, and roughly 36% of the companies are saying that that is one of the factors. It doesn't mean it's the only factor, but we are beginning to track this information.

152
00:28:49,500 --> 00:29:08,300
We have started to collect that data this year, and on the projects that we completed in two thousand and nineteen, roughly forty-seven percent of the companies said that Greater Bay Area was one of the factors that they considered when making their investment or their expansion.

153
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:27,150
統計啊！誒，最後一個問題係有關嗰個大灣區啦，又政府就講大灣區。咁而家誒大灣區都推動得誒都如火如荼啦。咁政府有冇評估，因為大灣區嘅因素而導致內地或者海外公司喺香港開誒呢個情況，你哋有冇作出一個估計同評估咧？

154
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:49,500
Mr. Phillips, perhaps if I could also address the question of how many of the companies that we work with are looking at the mainland opportunity. Previously, we have reported that it's around ninety percent of the companies. In terms of how many of the companies we work with are looking at the Greater Bay Area.

155
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:49,120
誒主席就今次嗰個統計調查嘅結果咧，誒都係好消息嚟嘅。因為如果以呢個二零一七年到二零一九年計咧，冇公司處於海外及內地嘅駐港公司數目咧，嗰個增加個幅度咧有百分之。

156
00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:09,130
九點九嚇，去到咧係九千零四十家噉啊！呢個都係一個可喜嘅現象。咁如果係按地區分咧，就頭三名咧就係中國內地、日本同埋美國。就中國內地咧一千七百九十九，日本一千四百十三，美國咧都有一千三百四十四嘅。

157
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:38,900
喺嗰個誒貿易啊，喺個經濟活動方面嘅合作嚇，同埋誒可以講係一個即係互相依存嚇嘅一個噉樣嘅局面。咁亦都希望咧，即係而家喺國際市場上咧有啲單邊主義啊。

158
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:58,910
啊，保護主義啊，呢啲咧都都能夠咧，慢慢係消除嚇，即係大家合作共贏咧，先至係正路。我我想問一個誒，比較再細分呢個數字咧，就因為咧而家講呢個剛才講嘅數字咧，係有地區總部、地區辦事處同埋當地辦事處加。

159
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:20,770
當然啦，如果係設立地區總部咧，嗰個作用同埋重要性係更大嘅嚇。咁當然我哋希望咧喺地區總部方面嘅增幅係誒更加理想啦。咁而呢個整體嚟計咧就話當中咧係作為地區總部公司嘅數目嘅增長咧係百分之九點一係都係唔錯。

160
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:40,780
嘅噉啊！但係誒，如果以地區分咧，就點分咧咁嚇？即係整體就中國內地佔多啦。地區總部嗰個誒分佈嘅狀況又如何咧？就係同埋咧，就係我哋點樣去進一步咧，係宣傳推廣，係令到我哋嘅貿易夥伴。

161
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,550
就係佢哋點睇？

162
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,650
唔該，主席，啊，我想問一問啊。

163
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,430
Mr. Phillips, well.

164
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,320
係嚇，嗰個重要性更高嚇。噉我哋點樣去推廣呢方面咧？

165
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,110
In fact, 29 investments from ASEAN compared to 25 from France.

166
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:21,810
啊！我我相信喺個投資推廣方面咧，都一定要考慮因素咧，都係主席。好，下一位係蔣麗雲議員。

167
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:53,870
所以，我我 proposals and our propositions are very much crafted around the nature of an individual business.

168
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:33,780
就係呢一個由法國，法國嗰邊有十八點五percent嘅，再跟住咧就係就係英國同埋呢個德國，分別咧就係十五點六個percent同埋十一點五個percent嘅。

169
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:44,880
wider China, wider Asia, we'll be talking to them about opportunities using corporate treasury centres, for example. Depending upon the sector, we'll go into more detail on other structures that might be available.

170
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:14,390
Thank you. Firstly, if I could just make an observation on the projects that we completed in two thousand and nineteen, where the new investment or the expansion was coming from, and it largely tallies with the overall survey results, which are cumulative investment over a long period of time.

171
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:34,400
But the top five sources were the mainland, the US, UK, Japan and France. So that's where we've seen the significant new investment from. I'd also mention that ASEAN overall was beginning to come into quite a significant number.

172
00:32:40,390 --> 00:33:00,400
in in terms of the breakdowns of the R H Qs, Mr Tang will supplement. Yeah. 哎，主席，咁頭先啊就問到嘅情況就係話，誒以地區總部而言咧，就邊笪地方係嗰個增幅最大咧？咁其實喺統計上面咧，我哋當日咧都有誒作啲方面咧嘅數字。

173
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:20,410
上面嘅蒐集嘅，其實增得最多咧，以幅度而言咧，百分比而言咧，就係呢個國內嘅國內嘅企業嚟香港嘅增幅咧就最多嘅。喺相對誒兩年前咧，即係二零一七年咧，就個增幅咧就其實有成四成咁多嘅，有四十點三個percent嘅。咁第二增幅而言咧，而多咧。

174
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:55,950
係誒噉，我剛才問嘅第二個問題咧，就係話有咩誒具體嘅誒措施嚇方法去吸引咧更加多嘅我哋嘅貿易夥伴咧，係選擇以香港作為佢哋嘅地區總部啊。因為地區總部當然比就咁純粹一個地區辦事處或者當地辦事處咧係。

175
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:28,750
The approach that we take from Invest Hong Kong is to approach these larger companies on a very targeted approach and put propositions to them about what they can do in Hong Kong, and that will include the opportunities within Hong Kong itself, Greater Bay Area.

176
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,770
Mr. Phillips。

177
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,400
即係。

178
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,840
呢幾個地方嘅競爭同埋未來嘅情況咧？

179
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,770
誒深圳好啊嚇，甚至環琴啊嗰啲。

180
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,210
噉啊，就其他外其他外國嘅地方嗰啲人。

181
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,800
What we do is we address any particular concerns that they have.

182
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,850
and it will invariably depend upon where they see their end market.

183
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:24,700
我應該係啊擺喺邊度咧？咁噉，你哋啊點睇？

184
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,970
誒呢一個誒，即係除咗中國內地之外啦嚇，因為我知道中國內地係最大嘅投資者啦。

185
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,810
噉佢哋點睇啊？呢一個誒深圳，譬如話誒，佢設公司係香港好啊？

186
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:56,230
所以，very often we will be talking to to companies who are weighing up whether it's Hong Kong, whether they go to Zhongshan, whether they go to Shanghai or Singapore or elsewhere.

187
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:45,440
inevitably, this depends upon each individual company and their perspectives, their ambitions, and indeed the experience of the management teams.

188
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:26,080
That is by far the most important factor when companies are weighing up where to decide to locate. Other issues tend to be icing on the cake. But what we try to do is build the case for Hong Kong when we know that companies are making those comparisons.

189
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:14,510
啊！啊，主席就我其實剛才問呢個問題咧，其實背後都一個擔心嘅，就係過往咧超過半年嘅社會嘅動亂啊，會唔會係嚇怕咗外來嘅我哋呢啲貿易夥伴咧，選擇香港作為佢哋香港誒嘅地作為一個地區嘅誒總部啊，或者我哋嘅辦事處噉啊。不過咧。

190
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:17,870
你你你點樣睇佢哋啊個考慮，或者係未來嚟講呢啲地方啊，即係同香港嘅競爭比較會係點樣咧？咁嚇，即係譬如我係一個投資者，我都要研究。OK，我個office嚇，或者我個創科公司。

191
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:46,990
但係，非常難説，什麼係總體差別，係香港、深圳、中山、新加坡，因為它都取決於個公司、個情況、佢哋想達成嘅目標，同埋好少少嘅管理團隊嘅經驗同佢哋嘅認識。

192
00:37:46,990 --> 00:38:07,000
and that can include where they would like to live, where they would like their children to have schooling, what sort of healthcare they're looking for. So there're multiple factors involved in this.啱啊啱啊，所以就係嗯，即係我喺度成日都諗啊，你香港你要吸引嚟投資，你係有優勢係。

193
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,030
香港得。

194
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,370
嗱。

195
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,120
都係主席。

196
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,630
譬如税務。

197
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,240
去吸引更多人嚟咧。

198
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,560
好，下一位係黃定光議員。

199
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,330
一嚇，你認為需要點樣？

200
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,560
噉我喺大陸做嘅話，噉。

201
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:54,190
幾百萬人嘅市場，噉我點解要嚟香港咧？即係我除咗睇到香港今日仲有一個金融業嘅優勢之外。

202
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:20,610
有咩吸引人咧？或者我應該咁講，我哋可以製造更乜嘢更多吸引人嘅條件咧？即係政府可以去考慮㗎嘛？

203
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:18,860
係，噉你話假如我係一個發展產品嘅公司，OK，或者係當中而家絕大多數好多公司係做呢個貿易啊、批發零售啊噉樣。

204
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:20,980
所以那係我哋嘅焦點，我哋嘅 engagement with companies， in terms of how can they generate revenues in a swift period of time to justify the investment.

205
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:08,440
但係我哋金融業，你睇到金融業，我哋佔到其實個比例都係一千七百幾間，我睇到嚇，即係都OK嚇。噉啊，但係其他嗰啲forward嚟呢度。

206
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:08,390
但我會always come back to the fact that most of all，what we need to demonstrate to companies is how they're going to generate revenue。That is by far the most important factor in deciding where to make an investment。

207
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:51,700
Well, certainly taxes one of the factors, and certainly within government we're always looking at whether taxation or other incentives could help add to the raison d'etre for investing in Hong Kong.

208
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:44,190
我請人又平，即係唔係咪平啲？而家唔知啦。最新數字，但係誒各方面都會平。就算係住屋啊，O K都有優勢啊。或者我推定我攞只新嘅產品入嚟，我喺大陸嘅市場都大啊。我

209
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,480
Mr. Phillips。

210
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,780
誒，雖然。

211
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,420
啊！但係社會上面咧。

212
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,150
企業嘅統計調查咧。

213
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,280
相對嚟講咧，係滯後嘅，啊！

214
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,340
係舊年六至八月舉行嘅。

215
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,490
啊！投資誒，你哋嘅睇法會係點樣樣？

216
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,190
我想問問政府對於而家？

217
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,150
香港止暴制亂咧，亦都初見成效。

218
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:59,280
若果喺國際上面咧，中美中美貿易談判第一階段嘅協議咧已經簽咗。

219
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:15,930
誒而家議會方面，尤其是區議會方面咧，誒嗰個開場咧都立立亂。

220
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:51,630
就以調查之後報告嘅撰寫報告之後咧，呢幾個月咧，形勢亦都有好大嘅轉變。

221
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:31,190
啊！嗰啲裝修啊，嗰啲破壞人哋商鋪啊，嗰啲嘢，嗰啲環境咧，相對咧，而家就誒呢近誒呢段時間咧，就好似誒少咗出現啦。

222
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:23,160
I think with that question that the business environment is challenging. Obviously, there's a number of external factors that you've mentioned, including the US-China trade tensions, a general slowing of the global economy, and of course the unrest and violence that we've seen in Hong Kong.

223
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:56,280
嗰個形勢嘅發展，你哋嗰個誒對於有關香港將來嗰個營商環境嘅前景，同埋吸引海外或者內地公司嚟香港誒開業。

224
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:43,450
In terms of the issues within Hong Kong, clearly addressing them and restoring law and order to the city, so there's certainty for businesses, is the top priority. In terms of wider issues, in terms of global.

225
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,820
係。

226
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,170
哦。

227
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,340
OK。

228
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,080
O.K.啦，O.K.

229
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,960
啊！

230
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,790
去等一等，去派出所。

231
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,240
而家請有關嘅政府官員入會議室。

232
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,820
有意提問嘅委員，請按下要求發言嘅按鈕。

233
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,440
economy obviously that's somewhat beyond.

234
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:20,430
好，如果冇委員再發問嘅話咧，咁依個議題就討論到依度為止。多謝各位政府官員。

237
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:33,970
好，以前嘅第五項，內地同香港嘅商貿關係修訂內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係嘅安排服務貿易協議。

238
00:42:47,870 --> 00:43:07,880
Hong Kong's gift to control those. What we do at the practical level is talk to companies about where we can see that they can find angles to grow their business in the city. So it becomes a very bespoke conversation with an individual investor.

239
00:43:46,660 --> 00:44:06,670
政府當局提供咗嘅討論文件包括立法會文件C B括弧一三二九斜棟一九至二零括弧零五號文件。秘書處就有關嘅事項，亦都移備咗最新嘅背景資料，係立法會文件C B括弧一三二九斜棟一九至二零括弧零六號文件。

240
00:44:44,220 --> 00:45:04,230
多謝誒主席啊！今日我哋係介紹啊CIPPA啦，我諗呢個大家都係誒比較熟悉嘅啦。咁誒事實上咧，喺CIPPA自從二零零三年簽訂咗之後咧，其實每年我哋都要誒更新嚇，同埋係誒去更新。

241
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,160
委員作一個簡介。

242
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,660

資格互認咧，去獲得延續嘅處理。

244
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,350
咗啊！Sipa下邊服務協議誒貿易協議呢個修訂。

245
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:28,510
工廠檢查亦都係有一個範圍嘅，咁個範圍就係喺廣東自貿區入面嘅工廠。噉我哋今次呢個啊修訂協議咧，亦都將呢一個範圍係擴展至到內地全境嘅工廠。咁亦都為我哋嘅業界帶嚟一個新嘅業務嘅誒誒機遇。

246
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:35,080
係好似個投影片係撈緊落嚟。今天咧，我哋咧已經係將嗰啲內容咧整合同埋擴充到四份嘅紙協議，即係話喺super嘅框架協議下面咧，有四份嘅紙協議咧就涵蓋貨物貿易、服務貿易、投資嘅保障同埋啊。

247
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:56,950
投資嘅保障保護同埋嗰個經濟技術合作嘅協議，換言之咧，CPTPP已經升級為一個咧，真係一個誒具國際水平誒相約嘅一個誒雙邊嘅自由貿易協議嗰個格局同埋一個規模。噉就今天我哋咧主

248
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:16,960
要同大家委員咧去介紹一下，就係喺服務貿易協議下邊咧，喺二零一五年簽訂之後咧，首次係一個比較全面嘅更新啊，同埋現代化咁誒呢個咧就喺舊年十一月廿一號啊，去簽署就係香港特區政府。

249
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:36,970
同埋國家商務部去簽署咗，咁將會喺啊今年嘅六月一號正式去實施嘅。噉啊，Cpa服務協議咧，今次嗰個修訂咧，主要尋求咧係能夠喺服務誒各種環節上面咧有所去提升。噉佢個具體嘅內容個形式咧係。

250
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:56,980
包括喺企業嘅股率權嘅比例啊，資本嘅要求係會有所放寬，誒或者佢業務範圍有所擴大。咁喺專業人士嘅資質要求方面，亦都係有所係寬鬆嘅處理。誒，包括我哋誒有好多嘅專業人士嘅。

251
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:21,070
第三咧就係誒，Cpa尤其喺服務貿易協議下邊咧，已經誒好多年嚟咧係有一個所謂廣東省先行先試嗰個做法同埋經驗，亦都有好嘅成果。因此今次咧，我哋亦都將粵港澳大灣區喺服務貿易下邊嗰個開放措施咧納入。

252
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:46,640
最後咧，就係亦都係有誒，相當一部分嘅措施係而家只係局部喺某些省份或者地區實施咧，佢將會係獲得係全境嘅實施嘅。咁呢個係一個即係誒總括嘅一種形式。噉我請我個誒助理處長李銘日先生咧誒，為大家簡介一。

253
00:47:46,640 --> 00:48:06,650
下咧，其中各種誒範疇裡面一啲具體嘅例子，好嘛？多謝處長。啊，唔該，處長。噉啊，今次呢個修訂協議咧，其實喺好多個誒服務領域咧，都會有一啲新增嘅開放措施。噉我哋已經喺文件嗰度咧，就已經再熟咗。噉我哋都藉住今日呢個機會，噉就簡選其中一啲嘅誒誒領域咧，就同。

254
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:30,900
咁首先係誒檢測認證服務啦。檢測認證服務係我哋香港其中一項優勢嘅產業。噉啊喺內地強制性產品認證，即係我哋簡稱嘅C C C領域咧，合資格嘅香港檢測機構係可以同內地嘅指定機機構咧係開展一個合作，噉啊進行一個產品。

255
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:50,910
嘅檢測咁不過產品嘅檢測現時嘅範圍咧係只限於喺內地加工或者生產嘅C C C產品啦，或者係香港加工嘅C C C產品。咁今次呢個修訂協議咧係將呢一個範圍係擴闊咗，係擴展至誒任何地區，全球任何地區加。

256
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,190
冇意思。

257
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,620
咁喺法律服務方面咧。

258
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,270
進行年度註冊，噉係會便利到我哋嘅業界嘅。

259
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:39,450
亦都係話，即係代表我哋可以誒香港嘅業界可以全資營運呢一啲嘅公司，噉係會便利到我哋嘅投資者可以去拓展內地嘅事務啦。

260
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:30,250
份文件咧都有誒詳細去講，就係喺唔同嘅呢啲誒，譬如喺內地元素上面啊，或者係主創人員啊、演員比例等，都會有啲放寬嚇。

261
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:46,630
咁而第三點就係誒修訂協議會允許香港嘅法律執業者誒通過特定嘅考試，取得大灣區執業嘅資質，咁從事一定範圍裡面嘅內地法律事務。

262
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:10,690
係為三十個percent嘅噉，但係誒係喺我哋嘅修訂協議咧，就取消咗呢一個誒限誒呢一個限制嘅噉，亦都會有利一啲我哋比較小型啲嘅律師事務所啦，噉係進入內地嘅法律服務市場。

263
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:56,010
咁另外修訂協議咧，亦都係會支持誒內地咧誒保險公司咧喺香港誒發行呢個巨災債券，亦都會放寬相關嘅限制。噉係為我哋香港嘅保險業同埋債券市場帶嚟一個新嘅發展。

264
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:12,000
會有助我哋香港嘅旅遊業界誒開發更多針對外國遊客一站多程嘅旅遊產品嚇，吸引亦都更多嘅海外旅客咧係嚟香到訪香港啦，又或者係經過香港去到訪內地，噉係會有助誒香港發展成為一個國際城市樞紐嘅國際城市旅遊樞紐嘅。

265
00:48:50,910 --> 00:49:10,920
加工或者生產嘅C.C.C產品，咁呢一個範圍擴闊咧，亦都係為我哋香港嘅檢測機構係帶嚟一啲誒新嘅商機嘅。咁同樣咧喺C.C.C產品啊C.C.C領域入面咧，我哋香港嘅認證機構都係可以同內地嘅機構合作啦。噉就進行工廠檢查。咁現時咧工

266
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:57,710
而家香港同內地律師事務所咧，係可以以一個合夥聯營嘅模式咧，係喺內地誒執業嘅。噉啊，我哋今次呢個誒修訂協議咧，其實係取消咗香港律師律香港律師事務所誒就住呢啲誒合夥聯營嘅裡面嘅最低出資比例嚇。咁現時係。

267
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:30,980
咁另外誒修訂協議亦都會允許香港嘅法律執業者，即係我哋嘅大律師同埋律師，噉就喺內地全境同時受聘於唔多於三個誒內地律師事務所咧，係擔任呢個法律顧問，亦都取消咗相關嘅審批要求啦，改為備案管理，亦都唔需要進。

268
00:50:49,150 --> 00:51:09,160
喺金融服務方面咧，係誒會有誒修訂協議，同埋喺內地咧都會有好多不同形式嘅開放。噉啊，包括係有期貨公司啦，誒有誒基金管理公司同埋證券公司嘅。誒咁呢一啲公司咧本身誒都有一個外資持股比例嘅上限嘅。咁現時係。

269
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:29,170
係為五十一個percent噉啊！內地將會喺今年咧就係放寬呢一啲嘅誒上限，噉就係可以去到一百percent，即係話可以誒獨資擁有嘅嚇。咁而另外喺誒內地亦都喺今年一月一號咧就放寬咗人誒人壽保險公司嘅外資持股比例，亦都係放寬至一百。

270
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,090
更大嘅發展空間。

271
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,390
是嗰個業務管理同埋發展嘅目標。

272
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:51,830
噉啊，另一個另一個點咧，就係誒修訂協議係會新增一項措施，就係會允許。

273
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:33,410
技術性啲嘅用語，噉我哋希望可以幫業界理解，同埋誒以往過往部分委員都有曾經建議過嘅，噉我哋會加強誒相關嘅宣傳工作。

274
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:46,190
我哋已經向香港嘅企業簽發咗三千二百多份香港服務提供者證明書，咁等呢啲企業可以以super優惠嘅條件去到內地市場開業。

275
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:59,910
咁喺我哋簽發嘅香港服務提供者證明書，最受歡迎嘅四個行業嘅分別為運輸物流、分銷、航空運輸同埋人員提供與安排嘅。

276
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:26,880
同埋誒業界會比較關心嘅落實安排方面嘅資料，咁亦都會係回答翻業界嘅提問。咁到時我哋會廣邀誒香港業界嘅代表參加，係希望啊業界可以更精準咁去掌握呢一啲開放措施嘅詳情。

277
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:50,870
噉啊！修訂協議係上年十一月簽定嘅。咁簽定以嚟咧，我哋應馬不停蹄噉係為業界舉辦幾個簡介會，亦都同誒各個商會啊同埋相關機構保持緊密聯繫，係為業界提供最新嘅資訊。咁呢方面我哋會繼續嘅。

278
00:54:52,110 --> 00:55:10,820
香港嘅產業測量師合資格嘅專業人士咧，佢哋係唔需要誒考試或者資質認證咧，佢哋可以直接喺深圳前海啦、珠海橫琴同埋廣州南沙係直接註冊執業，噉係開展房地產估價嘅服務嘅。

279
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:18,990
喺視聽服務方面咧，修訂協議係為誒香港嘅電影啦、香港嘅電視劇啦、電視動畫啦，又或者係香港同內地嘅合拍片咧，有唔同形式嘅開放嘅。噉啊喺誒呢個大家喺見到呢個誒誒呢個slide同埋喺嗰個。

280
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:53,040
咁喺旅遊方、旅遊服務方面咧，誒修訂協議會優化由香港入境嘅外國旅行團進入珠三角地區同埋汕頭市停留一百四十四小時免免辦簽證嘅政策，同時亦都會增加誒相關嘅入境口岸啦，亦都會擴大停留嘅區域。呢一個措施咧將會。

281
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:34,910
喺印刷服務方面咧，誒現時咧喺誒包裝裝環印刷品嘅方面咧，其實香港服務提供者已經可以獨資係誒營運呢一方面嘅業務嘅。噉啊，我哋嘅修訂協議咧，係就住誒呢個除咗呢啲包裝裝環印刷品之外嘅誒印刷業務。

282
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:54,920
即係譬如書本啊，或者係雜誌印刷方面咧，噉係其實佢係會將嗰個香港香港方面嘅股權比例上限放寬至唔超過七十個percent，噉係會誒呢個措施亦都會適合適用於內地全景啦。噉啊，香港投資者係嘅持有股權係可以更加有效達。

283
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:21,170
喺啊，建築及相關工程方面咧，修訂協議係會延續已經到咗期嘅資格互認安排。噉啊，包括就係結構工程師啦、規劃師啦、建建築測量師同埋誒建築師嘅。噉啊，通過互認或者係考試而攞到內。

284
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:41,180
地資格嘅香港建築專業人士咧，係可以喺誒本身喺內地執業嘅絕誒範圍咧，本來係只係限於廣東、廣西同埋福建嘅。咁今次呢個修訂協議係將呢一個地域嘅範圍係擴展至內地嘅全景，係令到我哋誒香港專業人士會有。

285
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:33,830
服務業一直係香港嘅經濟名物，亦都係我哋嘅專長啦。咁Super喺二零零三年簽訂起咧，噉啊誒，亦都會逐步擴充我哋香誒Super服務業嘅誒貿易開放措施，亦都會幫助到我哋嘅服務業界去去開展內地嘅市場。噉啊，截至上年二零一九年十二月咧。

286
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:53,170
外，我哋當然亦都會透過電話或者電郵等嘅方式去回應啊業界嘅一啲嘅查問。

287
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:22,460
呢個修訂協議誒，頭先我誒揀咗七個誒領域就同委員介介紹噉。但係其實誒佢有新措施嘅誒領域，其實唔止呢七個嘅咁喺立法會文件，我哋都再述咗。咁由於呢個修訂協議涉及嘅範圍好廣闊啦，咁同埋都喺個協議本身都會有採用一啲。

288
00:56:51,150 --> 00:57:11,160
咁另一方面咧，我哋計劃喺修訂協議實施之前，即係今年嘅六月一號之前啦，就會同國家商務部喺香港合辦一個大型嘅宣講會，亦都會邀請誒相關內地嘅部委咧誒嚟到呢個宣講會，係直接向業界親身介紹呢一啲嘅開放措施啦。

289
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:47,170
咁另外，我哋呢啲頭先所講嘅新嘅開放措施咧，已經上載至我哋工業貿易署嘅誒Sipa專題網頁。誒，我哋亦都會透過其他嘅形式啦，例如誒參加展覽啊，或者係誒誒出版一啲刊物同埋短片嘅形式咧，就向業界去介紹呢啲新嘅開放措施。咁另

290
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:15,030
噉啊！主席經過十幾年嘅發展，Super確立咗香港投資者參與內地市場嘅領先嘅優勢，亦都為我哋港商喺內地發展係創造更有利嘅條件，同埋開闢更多嘅渠道。噉我哋誒希望可以業界會繼續把握Super帶嚟嘅機遇啦。噉係誒開拓佢哋誒業務。

291
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:35,040
嘅新嘅發展前景。噉我哋今日嘅簡介到此為止。咁歡迎好唔該曬。誒，而家係提問嘅時間，我建議都係連問連答五分鐘啊。咁首先係陳振英議員，唔該。唔該主席。誒，首先我好歡迎即係特區政府同國家商務部舊年十一月誒簽咗新一輪嘅CPR框架啦。咁

292
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:55,050
噉啊，我啊代表銀行界，咁所以我特別關心關於銀行服務領域嗰啲優惠措施。咁頭先咧就誒，主方咧就冇喺PPT度列出銀行嗰啲嘅。噉我喺文件咧就睇到有九條啦，包括擴大香港銀行喺內地嘅服務範疇啦，推動雙向跨境投資服務同埋降低。

293
00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:15,060
香港銀行進入內地市場嘅門檻等等，咁好多都係熟口熟面嘅政策，其實都講咗好耐下㗎啦。噉我有幾個問題嘅，第一個問題就係話文件都提到要開展誒跨境理財通嘅試點啦，就等粵港澳大灣區嘅內地居民可以嚟香港誒銀行咧買香港。

294
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:35,070
嘅理財產品，亦都可以讓香港居民咧通過大灣區嘅內地銀行買內地嘅銀行產品。咁誒，頭先都講咧，政策就會二零二零年六月一號起實施。噉我想問呢個理財通嘅政策嘅細節咧，係幾時先有咧？係咪等頭先誒，即係助理處長都？

295
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:55,080
講咧，等嗰啲宣講會啊，即係遲啲有個宣講會嗰度先出嚟咧。誒，咁第二個問題就係話，其實誒呢一啲政策咧，我理解就一直係誒財經事務及庫務局跟嘅。我講銀行嗰啲啦，咁誒Sipa就係商經局或者係公務處呢邊負責嘅。咁如果係要跟進呢啲細節，究竟我係咪都係問翻財富？

296
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:15,090
局啊，定係可以通過你商經局嚟代辦咧嚇？咁呢個第二個問題。誒，第三個問題咧就係其實誒開放政策裏邊有一條咧，就係支持港資非銀行支付機構喺內地開展電子支付服業務嘅。噉我理解呢啲就係好簡單，就類似八達通呢啲噉嘅，即係非銀行嘅支付機。

297
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:35,100
構啦，噉佢哋如果喺內地開展業務咧，應該就用交通服務，等於當年香港港鐵嗰啲誒支付為先嘅。咁作為一個切入點，咁想問下咧喺噉樣開展嘅即係框架度咧，有冇一啲誒具體嘅政策嘅嘢？你去同內地嘅運輸機構？

298
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,310
消防款。

299
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:35,570
下一位係羅偉國議員。誒，多謝主席。

300
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,180
建建築及相關工程服務方面嘅作物都係相當多嘅。

301
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:00,080
誒，住房及城鄉建設部噉就提出咧。

302
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:26,820
誒咁呢個情況咧，係當然業界係好希望能夠有所改變啦。

303
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:55,070
誒，我同謝偉權議員咧，就曾經喺二零一八年嘅四月度咧，就係去信。

304
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:39,080
誒咁呢個既然係好消息啦，不過咧就業界咧其實就係疑問係相當多嘅，就係講到咧具體操作問題。

305
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:47,170
誒主席，今次咧係C牌裏邊嘅服務貿易協議嘅修訂咧，就的確對香港好多不同業界咧，都係一個好消息嚟㗎。

306
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:12,630
即係工程師嘅即係職稱咧噉樣啊，或者係其他幾個即係專業咧噉，咁呢呢啲都係誒疑問嚟嘅。咁所以我好希望咧，就係話喺嗰個誒。

307
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:29,870
誒，正如頭先咁講啦，三月或者下旬開嗰宣講會嘅時候，我哋希望即係有啲進展，可以同議員或者係界別誒有啲係誒介紹嘅。咁呢個係我哋誒爭取當中嘅嚇。多謝，多謝主席。

308
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:44,470
亦都城鄉誒誒誒住建部咧，就誒嗰個回應咧係相當迅速，同埋都係好正面嘅。噉就話咧係都係會積極考慮咧取消呢啲限制，噉就具體嘅誒操作咧就要通過呢個批評。

309
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:55,110
去讓佢可以首先喺內地嘅運輸系統度咧，開展呢啲誒電子服務、支付服務，咁先至可以咧進一步即係誒達到你個效果嘅。咁呢三個問題，我想先請處方回答，唔該。處長好誒，多謝主席，亦都係多謝陳正英議員嗰嗰個誒提問啦。或者我講咗嗰個。

310
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:15,120
個體制先，因為頭先啊，滕振晶語言提到啊，實在super嘅服務貿易協議咧，係方方面面嗰個行業都涉獵得到。咁嗰個體制上係點咧？誒，我哋係會同有關嘅政策局或者部門，剛個該個專業嘅政策局同埋部門咧，係緊密合作嘅。有好多嗰個。

311
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:35,130
誒，其中嗰個要求或者設想咧，必須都係要嚟嚟自誒政策局嗰度。但係當然啦，我哋作為成個即係Cpa都係一個誒性質上係一個貿易協議咧，係一個服務上面嘅誒或者係誒貿易上面嘅嘅一種協議。噉我哋就比較熟悉呢一啲體。

312
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:55,140
制，因此咧，我哋個誒喺內地嘅對口咧就係誒國家嘅商務部嚇誒商務部亦都同樣誒同我哋咧誒特區誒公營貿易處嗰個角色一樣，做一個統籌嘅角色。咁因此誒翻返去阿陳議員，你個問題咧，你有一啲具體嘅意見咧，我相信啊，最好兩。

313
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:15,150
兩家都可以表表達嘅，咁當然啦。誒，最終政策嗰個走向或者最具體個做法咧，都要由誒該個政策局嚇去決定點樣做法係最好，因為佢哋係專家部門同埋嗰個範疇最熟悉。但係點樣表述喺誒supper下邊，或者點樣？

314
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:35,160
咁去啊！爭取嗰個放寬嗰個形式咧，我哋可以係參與同埋統籌嘅噉。呢個就喺個體制上，我首先答一答。第二個咧就關於啊，或者我一拼關於誒理財通同埋嗰個非啊銀行支付機構喺內地開展電子支付業務。

315
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:55,170
嗰兩條問題，大家都可能注意得到喺我哋文件嗰附件裏面個表述嗰個表裏面咧，喺性質上面咧，我哋係誒講咗呢個係係一個誒政策支持嘅一個確定，即係話政策立咗落去。誒而家咧就誒，正如陳振英議員所講咧。

316
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:15,180
我哋就要下一步要係誒定出一個細節嚟咁咧。呢個咧誒就係要啊財經事務局嗰邊同佢個對口咧誒要定立呢個細節。我知道佢哋而家都係喺度進行中，噉我哋誒未有一個具體嘅時間表可以畀到啊，議員啊，今日。但係當日誒誒誒。

317
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:20,370
喺以往，即使有私爬都好，就其實香港嘅建築工程業界咧，喺內地參與工程建設咧，係相當多限制。就簡單講，基本上就係只可以參與咧涉外嘅項目，噉啊，純內地項目咧就係冇機會做嘅。

318
01:04:44,770 --> 01:05:04,780
啊！噉啊，殷處長咧，當時咧亦都係對呢方面咧好積極回應嘅。就經過一段時間嘅努力，與內地嘅相關部委嘅商討咧，就喺今天咧，我哋誒即係見到呢個服務貿易誒雙元協議嘅修訂咧，喺。

319
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,830
咁呢法律服務咧，你當中咧，你就話。

320
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,000
希望咧，我哋都大致朝呢個方向，可以係去探討。

321
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:46,310
多謝主席。嗯，主席，嗯，我我其實想有啲跟進，或者我撳第二次咧，我再誒再獎一部分。O.K. 好，下一位獎黎雲兒。

322
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:59,270
唔該，主席，我其實我都想係誒問嗰啲護認嘅誒有一度，我覺得幾interesting嘅，就係誒第五點咧，有關法律服務服務。

323
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:40,060
第一，香港法律職業者，你而家係咪講緊香港嘅律師先？係攞到香港執照嘅認可律師係咪咧？噉你講嚟答我。第二咧，可通過特定考試，呢個特定考試係咪特別畀香港嘅律師去考咧？

324
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:29,470
噉啊，譬如今日嗰個第九頁嘅投影嗰度咧，都已經講到，包括咧就係誒資格互認方面啦，就誒註冊執業嘅地域啦。誒咁亦都特別提到咧，前海啊、橫琴啊、廣州南沙啊嘅方面，可能有更加進一步嘅誒。

325
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:59,930
譬如話，就講到註冊執業嘅地域範圍由廣東、廣西、福建擴到內地全景噉，梗好啦。究竟具體咧，佢想註冊執業咁去邊一度去辦手續咧？又或者喺嗰個誒資格嗰方面咧？譬如話點樣能夠取得內地嘅誒？舉例下即係。

326
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:33,430
回應呢個具體嘅問題咧，真係有好清晰嘅窗口哦。譬如話喺香港有誒誒接受查詢嘅相關嘅窗口，內地咧誒亦都有咧係好清晰嘅指示。究竟因為誒有關呢啲問題咧，會去到內地嘅邊一啲部門？

327
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:53,440
就可以係協助辦理啦，咁噉，所以我諗今日其實係個好好嘅機會嚇，即係我哋一方面係固然係好歡迎啊呢個發展，另一方面咧，亦都好希望咧，內地相關嘅部門同香港嘅部門咧，係能夠有實質嘅嘅架構咧。

328
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:13,450
去幫助我哋嘅業界啊！多謝主席。啊，處長有冇回應？好啊。誒，多謝主席，亦都多謝誒盧偉國議員嗰個誒誒支持啦。誒，就住頭先佢講到咧，誒盧盧偉國議員講嗰個例子係好好嘅，即係即係如何處理喺super下邊咧一啲具體執行嘅工作。

329
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:33,460
就係同住建部咧嗰度去攞一個澄清，即係話即係我哋嘅港資嘅誒個建築工程咧，係可以咧承辦喺誒自貿區裏面咧，唔單止係外涉外嘅誒資金嘅工程，亦都係咧可以誒涉辦咧係。

330
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:53,470
內地誒嘅工程咁呢個咧，我哋喺早前亦都通過呢個委員會咧，用網文件作實咗，就係咧就係誒國務院亦都出咗一個關於支持自由貿易試驗區深化改革創新若干措施裏面咧誒好具體咁寫咗呢個政策澄清咗落嚟。咁因此咧誒呢個即係話咧。

331
01:07:53,470 --> 01:08:13,480
喺今天我哋頭先誒呢個投影片所帶介紹嘅誒不同嘅開放措施之下咧，我哋都係要有啲具體嘅配套去配合嘅。咁呢個我哋係完全明白。喺通過誒國家商務部之後下咧，其實住建部都係同我哋包括發展局咧都係好互互。

332
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:33,490
通有無誒嗰個具體嗰個查詢窗口咧，我相信第一點咧係可以用我哋公務處嗰個查詢窗口。正如頭先都有講，我哋設立咗一啲熱線，同埋今天我哋啲所有同事都係會收集各種嘅意見同埋具體執行嘅情況。咁誒，如果誒委員覺得，

333
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:53,500
同誒相關政策局，包括發展局直接聯繫，而通過我哋去跟進，亦都可以。呢兩個我哋都可以接受。咁誒喺對誒我哋個對口嘅單位咧，我哋都希望有一個誒單位嗰個人員或者係個部門啊，畀到大家咁以便跟。

334
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,840
咁因為呢個幾幾interesting，我相信咧，因為你。

335
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:00,600
第四，從事一定範圍內的內地法律事務係咩咧？

336
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:35,040
誒，即係香港嘅一啲律師啊，噉我相信佢哋係誒，即係。

337
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:03,350
都好緊要㗎啦，成個廣東省係嘛？九加二噉樣，你好犀利㗎啦，係嘛？啲生意夠佢做到唔做添啊！真係～

338
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:11,910
一定範圍即係點樣咧？即係房地產你可以同佢做，OK？有啲咩嘢唔做得咧？噉係嘛？你可唔可可唔可以邊個可以答到我呢個問題？啊，處長。好啊。

339
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:24,380
誒多謝主席，總議員都係誒好啱嘅，問嗰啲問題，因為實在上我哋要誒深入解釋。誒呢一個咧就係誒喺嗰個誒。

340
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:53,860
定係都係翻佢內內地嗰個啊律師嗰個啊啊啊啊即係嘅考試咧？第三執業資質乜嘢嚟嘅咧？

341
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:13,510
噉我哋都係鼓勵咧，首先將個具體情況反映畀我哋特區聽，咁然方便我哋去跟進嘅。咁頭先所講嗰個例子，我哋覺得好好。誒，我或者好簡單補充啦。今次我諗一個好大嘅突破咧，就喺嗰個誒資格個互認方面，一方面有互認嗰個延續啦，另外。

342
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:33,520
方面，我哋睇到喺嗰個產業測量師嗰度咧，其實誒嗰個仲更加前進前衞啲嘅，就話唔需要通過互認，你只要攞到香港資格，就直接可以喺誒前海啊、珠海橫琴啊、南沙啊方面咧，直接註冊執業啦。咁呢個咧更加係好便捷嘅，我希。

343
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:23,120
啊，有一點你就話香港法律執業職業者可通過特定考試取得大灣區嘅執業資質，從事一定範圍內的內地法律事務。嗱，呢一句咧我就有四個問題。

344
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:44,670
嗰個誒法律嗰個執業者咧，呢度咧係包括兩方面。我哋誒香港有即係事務律師同埋大律師嘅。咁呢度咧，我哋係誒兩方面都係包括。咁呢個係一個誒都係算得一個進展啦嚇，因為我知道兩誒兩方面都好想即係喺。

345
01:11:44,670 --> 01:12:04,680
喺大灣區或者內地有參與律師嘅行業，咁呢度係一個進展。咁誒，所謂嗰個考試咧，誒而考完試之後，包括嗰個所謂一定範圍內嘅內地法律事務呢兩項咧，誒我哋嗰個誒律政署咧係同誒對口單位咧而家。

346
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:24,690
喺度商討中係希望將呢一個具體誒定翻落嚟。咁譬如頭先張議員你講嗰個誒考試嘅模式，我相信係會係誒具體針對係香港嗰個法律執業者嗰個情況而定嘅一啲考試嚟嘅嚇。噉就誒以至到誒佢哋可。

347
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:44,700
以喺而家做得嘅嘢之外，仲可唔可以做其他嘢？即係一定範圍嘅執業咁誒。執業資質即係執業資格噉啊，即係個意思。O.K.呢啲用語嘅問題係咁一定範圍內咧係啦。而家嚟講，譬如誒，我哋有誒誒。

348
01:12:44,700 --> 01:13:04,710
誒，我哋嘅律師可以包括擔任一啲法律嘅顧問嘅工作。而家已經得啦，而家已經得啦。咁但係誒，可唔可以做多啲其他嘅嘢咧？誒，咁呢個喺個法誒誒討論個當中，當然你誒，如果而家我哋嘅律師係通過現有個機制考取到。

349
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:24,720
內地嗰啲誒執業嘅資格咧，佢亦都可以從事一啲工作，但係亦都有誒一啲限制嘅。咁所以，凡此種種都係呢一個所謂一定範圍嘅執業個誒事務裏面誒嗰個嗰個範圍裡面咧，係誒喺度商討當中嚇。多謝主席。噉。

350
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,320
你另外傾嘅咧嚇。

351
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,440
係好。好啊，好啊。好唔該。

352
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:01,420
誒第三個問題就係誒而家誒三地就一一程多站咧，已經講咗好耐啦。

353
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:12,000
免税入內地啦，噉我知道一路喺度做緊嘅，咁而家係咪已經全部去達到免曬啦？而家已經。

354
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:46,680
係，署長。誒，多謝主席，多謝姚演員。因為今日我哋有個旅遊事務嘅專家喺度，噉我想請我哋誒旅遊誒旅遊事務助理專員啊，柯女士去回答一下。係，柯女士。

355
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:33,640
誒第四個問題就係誒，如果一程多站要推動嘅話，誒下一階段有冇啲具體支援香港旅行社嘅一啲措施，包括啊，即係嗰個整體計劃啊嘅一啲配合啊，同埋撥款嘅安排咧噉樣。嚇，四個問題。

356
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:17,990
誒，我唔知道誒，而家三地有冇開會就一程多站嘅一啲合作咧？誒，傾一啲具體嘅合作事項，包括咧誒合作嘅形式啦，同埋預算預算嘅嘅啲有關嘅誒費用嘅安排噉嘅咧。

357
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:29,820
舊年開始一月一號嚇啊開始實施，咁實施咗之後，我哋都睇到啊，我哋個貨品咧都係有誒增加嘅啊，進入內即係入內地嘅產品有上升嘅啊，都都有上升到有一個噉嘅即係現象啦嚇。

358
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:55,560
佢哋嗰個範圍會大咗啊，係咪噉啊？一定會受歡迎啦。噉啊，最緊要嘅就係個試特定考試呢個好緊要啦。你要啱佢考啊，係咪？噉你有時有好多字眼全部係內地字眼，咁又要點樣咧？咁希望呢一樣嘢咧，即係能夠係造成啦，係咪？你成個大灣區其實。

359
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:23,640
噉啊，不過一定範圍從事一定範圍內咧，噉我唔知佢指嘅係乜嘢啦。噉啊，會唔會好侷限咧？OK嚇，淨係做一樣嘢咧噉。你話淨係去到做顧問，噉我使咩考你個試啊？係咪？因為你都話啦，佢而家可以做顧問，可以可以人哋聘請佢做顧問，佢都得啦。佢使咩你使咩再考個試嚟做顧問？

360
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:43,650
而家好多律師都可以人哋聘請佢做顧問㗎，係咪啊？啊嘛，所以咧呢一樣嘢咧，我覺得你寫就即係係咁寫啦。O K，但係我覺得你都應該係真係誒鼓勵啲律師哦，你可以考咗個特定事，特別畀香港律師考嘅事，噉你就可以喺大灣區執業啦。噉樣係嘛？

361
01:14:43,650 --> 01:15:03,660
啊，咁噉，我覺得咁幾好啊！大家開心係嘛？努力啦，係咪？啊，另外我再問多樣嘢都好簡單。啊，我想知道咧，嗱，我哋其實最早咧，super咧係制定super，我哋咧就最主要希望咧，就係啊，香，現香港嘅產品啊，能夠係有個breakthrough咧，係全部即係。

362
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:33,010
好，誒，多謝主席。誒，喺貨物貿易嗰度係嘅，阿阿蔣議員嘅理解係啱嘅。誒，喺舊年我哋嚟誒向各位委員簡報嘅時候咧，誒，我哋就話將貨物貿易又亦都形成咗個協議啦。之餘咧，就將我哋除咗有特地產品。

363
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:53,020
五個原產地要求，噉就每一個產品都要去傾嘅，咁即係都要時間。因為誒，super一開始簽嘅時候已經定咗原則㗎啦。所有香港嘅產品進入內地市場，原則性都係用零關税，呢個確立咗嘅，從依家開始。嗯。只不過即係話要時間逐條誒產地來源規矩去傾。

364
01:15:53,020 --> 01:16:13,030
噉我哋就話啊都可以，但係同時間我哋由由嗰個貨物貿易協議開始咧，就話有一個一般性嘅產地來源要求。只要你符合一般性嘅產地來源要求咧，亦都可以用香港嘅產品名義用零關税進入市場。所以呢一個咧就一下子咧將呢個問題都解決咗。咁已經係。

365
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:52,730
誒夏威姚思榮議員嘅誒，多謝主席。誒就有關旅遊服務方面嘅嚇誒，大家都知啦，即係香港入境遊客咧，嗰個海外客嘅比例都係二十二左右啦嚇。噉啊比例就偏低嘅。咁如果優化即係香港入境嘅外國旅行。

366
01:16:52,730 --> 01:17:12,740
團咧誒採取一個免簽嘅，或者優優化個簽證安排咧誒，應該有助推動一程多站嘅呢啲噉嘅產品啊。噉啊，呢次誒CIPER有關講就係誒會誒優化呢方面嘅誒簽證安排。我唔第一個問題想問誒呢個安排。

367
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:32,750
幾時開戰咧？噉樣嚇。第二個問題就係有關嗰個誒港珠澳大橋東島咧，誒準備開放畀誒呢個誒外國人或者內地人去嗰邊參觀嚇。咁誒喺誒傾呢個免簽安排嘅時候，會唔考慮埋咧港珠澳大橋東？

368
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:52,760
東島嘅一啲免簽安排咧噉啊，噉我先申報啦。我哋公我哋集團下面咧有間公司應該係投咗呢方面嘅誒，即係東島嘅一啲誒要管理啊嘅一啲一啲噉嘅誒服務嘅啊，噉啊即係話呢個安排會唔會納入埋優化嘅範疇，還是？

369
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:52,050
下一位係張華豐議員。

370
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:49,570
我哋一直都有保持溝通，多謝。

371
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:04,750
誒準備要誒幾時出到台，同埋嗰啲費用幾多？呢方面你哋有冇一個噉嘅誒公佈嘅準備嘅咧？嚇，係專業。

372
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:05,160
啊，多謝主席。嗱，今日我咧所講嘅咧就係以內地香港嘅商貿嘅關係嘅修訂啊，噉啊當中亦都包含個證券服務嘅。

373
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:15,950
同時咧，誒除咗今次橫琴之外咧，其實旅議會嚟緊都會安排幾次唔同嘅大灣區嘅考察團啦。我哋希望喺呢個機會上面咧，令到多啲業界咧，誒可以瞭解多啲大灣區嘅發展，就誒。

374
01:19:47,400 --> 01:20:04,000
大灣區九市啦，再加埋汕頭，咁可唔可以頭先政策上面都講，希望可以增加入境口岸同埋誒擴大停留嘅區域咧？噉我哋都希望一評過同誒相關嘅內地部門一評過溝通，睇下可以開放到幾多？

375
01:20:44,300 --> 01:21:01,710
一個座談會同埋一個論壇，就等佢哋咧同嗰邊嘅業界咧多啲溝通，大家就有一個業務上嘅交流，睇下點樣可以咧盡量咧大家互相配合，做多啲一程多站嘅旅遊產品，噉啊引領多啲誒外國團隊啦，可以透過香港進入大灣區。

376
01:18:47,370 --> 01:19:07,380
多謝主席，多謝處長，多謝姚議員嘅提問。就住姚議員頭先嗰幾方面提問，噉我諗我做一回應啦。誒，頭先姚議員提到而家誒，我哋喺司帕下面新增加嘅外國人誒一四四小時免簽嗰個政策咧，其實我哋誒係都同。

377
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:27,390
誒上面即係內地嘅相關部委咧，一直係跟進緊嘅。咁誒而家政策上咧就係打開咗呢個門户啦。Super就係一個政策嘅大方向，但係一啲具體落實嘅細節啊，或者措施咧，其實我哋一直都同誒相關誒公安部啊、文旅部啊同埋商務部跟進。我哋就希望。

378
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:47,400
即係盡快可以攞到多啲誒具體嘅資料啦，而到誒更加適當噉樣跟進有關嘅措施。咁至於姚議員，你頭先提過話誒港珠澳大橋東人工島嗰邊會唔會同時間開放咧？而家暫時先排嗰個政策上咧，我哋就係誒凡即係珠三角地區咧，即係九市啦，即係等於大。

379
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:24,290
咁至於頭先姚月你提到一情多賺方面咧，其實我哋特區政府，尤其是我哋旅遊事務處咧，其實一直都好誒落力推推展呢一方面嘅工作啦。例如誒，我哋都有撥款畀誒香港旅遊業議會，噉就做一啲誒誒叫做誒。

380
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:44,300
visit啦，即係一啲誒考察啦。最近一次咧就係咧，我哋係一月初咧就舉辦咗一個考察團啦，就去咗橫琴。噉就希望咧，即係誒第一啦，畀業界瞭解多啲最新嗰邊嘅旅遊發展啦。第二咧，亦都咧係希望咧去有業界方面，因為我哋同時間咧都舉辦。

381
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:36,240
配合多啲誒唔同嘅旅遊產品，多謝。誒誒，主席誒就有關誒，我想追問都係第三個問題就係，嗱誒同業界之間，我都知道你哋有一啲嘅誒安排嘅嚇去考察噉，但係三地政府即係誒內地、香港、澳門三地政府就推動一程。

382
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:49,260
可唔可以為我哋解決呢個問題？唔該。係，處長。

383
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:56,420
局啊啊，證監會啊，佢哋一一個即係嗰個諮詢之後咧，我哋可以睇睇個點樣處理。

384
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:50,620
參與嘅，包括啊能源方面啊，包括係海洋工程啊，誒就包括呢個即係檢測認證啊，誒甚至係運輸物流啊等不同嘅行業。

385
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:56,250
多站有冇一個即係誒年度嘅預算同埋一啲誒計劃咧？即係一啲就係三你政府合作嗰個範疇咧，嗰個誒資源一定多過誒情侶議會咁去搞一啲噉嘅誒交流啊、考察嘅。咁呢方面，你哋喺誒未來嘅一年有冇呢方面嘅計劃？同埋呢個計劃。

386
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:26,180
好多謝議員。誒就住我哋三地政府誒嗰個合作方面咧，其實我哋一直同澳門嗰邊啊，同埋廣東省啦、文旅廳啦，同埋相關嘅誒地區，譬如廣東啊、誒誒廣州啊、深圳嗰啲誒旅遊廳咧，我哋都有保持溝通嘅。大家都誒一直睇下有。

387
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:46,190
一程多站上咧有啲乜嘢更好嘅發展，但係你話即係就住具體嘅工作計劃，我哋都傾緊咁有嘅時候咧，我哋會盡快同誒議員你彙報，同埋同業界誒溝通。多謝，即係包括誒誒費用開支預算係嘛？依依個我哋成個成個工作計即係點樣點樣可以合作得更加好。

388
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:25,460
噉啊，入邊咧亦都講過咧，即係話要積極落實推動內地同埋香港嘅基金嘅互認㗎。噉啊，豐富兩地互聯互通嘅交易產品，就允許符合條件嘅喺香港上市嘅唔同嘅股票嘅架構公司納入互聯互通嘅呢個交易。

389
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:45,550
咁但係咧，呢個雙邊嘅呢個金融嘅互聯互通，我哋已經期望咗好耐啦。但係首先，首先一樣嘢咧，我哋想即係開户口兩邊嘅互認咧，我講咗咧，我諗咧無數次嘅啦，喺唔同嘅呢個委員會、唔同嘅渠道我都講咗嘅啦。

390
01:23:45,640 --> 01:24:05,650
到而家為止，我哋咧兩邊誒嘅開户口嘅呢個户型確定咧都未做到。如果呢個户口嘅確定都開唔到嘅話，我哋所講嘅嗰個嗰個互聯互通啊，即係嗰個基金嘅户型安排啊，點樣接觸啲客户啊，咁根本。

391
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:25,660
都無從即係談起嘅，嗰個即係第一步嘅基本嘅開户，你都做唔到，咁點可以講到咧加強兩邊嘅嗰個金融合作咧？咁呢方面咧，我諗處長有冇方法幫我哋咧，即係解決呢個問題咧？因為始終呢個問

392
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:45,670
已經存在咗好耐，亦都同唔同嘅呢個部門溝通過。始終我哋咧都喺度等噉啊！我哋業界亦都即係唔知點樣嚇，即係如何落手啊！咁希望咧，即係呢個誒通過呢個噉嘅貿易協會嘅修訂咧。

393
01:24:49,840 --> 01:25:09,850
啊，多謝主席。啊，多謝啊張華鋒議員。啊，誒基金互認其實都誒行咗四年幾啊，有誒即係嗰個互聯互通方面嗰個發展係係需要更進一步。咁喺好具體嗰個開户方面咧，我諗我哋好樂意去去跟進同埋聯同嗰個財經事務局係睇下點樣。

394
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:29,860
去幫手嘅咁誒，我知道財經事務局亦都一直係喺度推動緊呢件事情啦。噉就誒，希望喺嗰個互聯互通方面，即係做得更加具體，特別喺落實方面。我或者會後，我同阿張議員去跟進一下嗰個即係最新誒。

395
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:49,870
喺開户嗰個情況啊，即係譬如業界想點樣做法啊，然之後我哋可以點樣去跟進誒？可以誒會後同啊張議員做一個跟進比較具體嘅，然之後我將啲意見反映翻，即係同我哋個對口誒通過誒，亦都係財經事務。

396
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:17,320
誒，主持啊！我哋真係好迫切嘅，需要呢個噉嘅户口嘅嗰嗰個認證。我哋都等到警都長埋嘅啦。如果唔係，個市場即係畀人搶咗去嘅啦。唔該曬嚇。O.K.好多謝誒，跟住係盧偉國議員第二輪。好啊！誒，多謝主席。就主席其實今次。

397
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:37,330
以誒呢個誒C.P.A.嘅服務協議嘅修訂啦，誒涉及到誒工程專業嘅界別咧，其實就都唔係單係頭先講個建築及相關工程服務嗰個範疇，因為咧其他有一啲行業咧都真係放寬咗香港公司嘅。

398
01:26:50,900 --> 01:27:10,910
咁所以，我頭先所問嘅就喺個協議簽訂之後咧，就究竟係具體嘅執業註冊啊、誒資格嗰個真係誒登記啊、註冊啊等等嘅問題咧，就都對於好多不同業界。

399
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:30,920
都係一個疑問嚟嘅，咁所以究竟係即點樣能夠更加透明、清晰地，讓咧係各個不同業界嘅誒朋友啊，都知道究竟誒喺香港去邊度查詢，然後喺內地咧係邊啲部門咧？

400
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:27,490
嗯。

401
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:50,250
係，主張。

402
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:21,940
個別嘅產品有個別嘅產地來源嗰個要求，咁呢個我哋亦都保留，希望做到最多嘅彈性畀業界，呢個係我哋嗰個即係做法啦，嚇。

403
01:29:50,500 --> 01:30:05,980
有啲整合啊誒嘅時候，我哋啲都要跟進，以免我哋畀一啲即係誒舊嘅資料。噉嘅時間咧，我哋希望都係聯同我哋唔同嘅政策局嘅部門，即係做一個噉嘅平台出嚟。咁但係我相信頭嗰兩步都係好緊要嘅。

404
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:46,190
唔該，啊，我有兩個問題，三個問題，啊，我想問翻咧，啱啱啊，阿處長講咧，就係話，誒，而家香港嘅產品入內地咧，誒，由舊年到而家咧，誒，就係有所增加嘅。我想問，主要係乜嘢產品咧？

405
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:50,190
或者係擴大咗，或者落實咗。咁誒呢一個喺個認知嘅層面，我哋會做嘅。第二個咧就係一個面對面嘅人嘅接觸啦。誒當然誒誒，第三方面就係嗰個文件上誒嘅資訊。但係我覺得第二方面面對麪人員嗰個接觸都好緊要嘅。誒。

406
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:51,030
係可以接受呢一啲嘅申請，咁即係真係要好清晰先得。就除咗熱線之外，於有啲已經係已經係建立咗個機制嘅，就其實好簡單啫。喺網上啊有一個即係網頁，可以係一站式，可以即係查到曬噉啊。當然最好啦，我睇下即係處方喺。

407
01:27:51,030 --> 01:28:11,040
呢方面咧有咩安排啊？嗯，好，處長。誒，多謝主席，多謝誒盧慧國議員。我諗我哋係做緊三方面嘅工作。第一方面咧，最直接就首先咧，我哋自己嘅行業咧要瞭解到喺super下邊誒嗰啲措施係乜嘢，因為誒我正如頭先所講嘅，基本上每年我哋都有更新。

408
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:31,050
噉係咪追都追唔切咧？噉嘅時候咧，我哋必須要我哋自己依個行業都要認識先。咁因此，我哋咧每一次簽咗，譬如正如今次都係咧，我哋會好密集式咁去同我哋啲界別，包括專業行業咧，去見面，去介紹究竟有啲乜嘢誒措施放寬咗。

409
01:28:50,470 --> 01:29:10,480
特別係同相關嗰個對口嗰個單位，咁因此咧，我哋就誒好希望誒，我哋亦都做過以往喺誒我哋宣講會嘅時候，唔單止係一個即係普通嘅宣傳，其實咧係有一啲誒工作小組或者工作方，就係唔同嘅誒部門咧，行業。

410
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:30,490
業專業咧，就喺佢哋組成一個同內地嗰個單位嗰個傾談嘅，咁因此通過嗰個機會咧，佢直接見到啊或者係認識到咧，真係主事嗰個部門嗰一啲工作人員或者係啲啊接觸嘅網絡，咁呢個係第二個人嘅層面，第三個咧我都絕對。

411
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:50,500
同意啊！維各語言嘅，當我哋更新咗、整合咗呢啲所謂接觸點之後咧，我哋咧就可以將佢咧喺我哋嘅網站嗰度睇下點樣去誒梳理咗之後去整合公開咗佢嚇。咁當然呢個我哋都要有一個責任係要更新嘅，因為誒如果誒譬如內地有一啲誒部門。

412
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:27,160
啊！主席噉啊，作為工程界代表嘅，最關心工程業界喺呢方面點樣把握機遇啦。咁或者誒會後咧，我就同處長傾傾，究竟係對誒工程業界嚇呢個私拍宣講會咧，幾時係邊都可以舉核啦。多謝主席。好誒，下位係張麗雲議員第二輪。

413
01:30:52,220 --> 01:31:12,230
唔好意思啊，主席，因為今天講主要係服務業咧，可能我就可以佢哋揾住啲資料先。手手頭上冇一個咁具體嘅資料。嗱，應該咁講咧，誒誒喺舊年應該係誒一月號啊，或者年初嘅時候，當我哋有咗呢個綜合一般性嘅產地來源誒誒嗰個要求之後咧。

414
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:32,240
我哋睇到申請我哋用誒cipa嗰個證書咧誒嗰個產品用零關税進入內地嗰個證書嘅數目係有所增加嘅嚇。咁當然隨住個月份唔同，可能有個改變有個幅度。誒開頭嗰幾月誒係係有個增加嘅，以我所記憶所及。當然後來事情。

415
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:52,250
有發展或者其他嘅影響係咪整體增加咧？我要翻去誒check check啲數噉，但係咧係誒一開始都係有啲哇呢個太細，我聽到嚇噉我或者會後畀啲資料誒議員喺呢啲方面，但係我相信係誒係歡受歡迎嘅呢一個措施。我哋我哋嘅業界同。

416
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,400
啊，查先生有冇咩補充？

417
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,850
你哋去幫佢傾啊，定係點樣咧？

418
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,880
係誒，佢哋係要求。

419
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:13,970
定係你哋聯絡嗰個專業界別，然後睇下佢哋嘅要求點咧？定係內地主內地主動去放開放開放呢啲行業咧？

420
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:48,080
呢一方面咧，特別喺誒建築工程界咧，我哋係同發展局咧係配合得即係好緊密嘅，去爭取呢啲即係資格噉樣嘅。嚇，我我想問下咧，嗱就誒，因為嗯。

421
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:55,790
個PowerPoint嗰個presentation咧，咁咧就主要係建築及相關工程服務啊。咁咁嗱，呢啲工程師、規劃師啊、建築測量師啊，咁等等嗰啲咁咧。

422
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:26,050
誒主席，誒關於誒醫療服務方面咧，誒香港嘅誒醫療專業人員咧，其實係可以喺內地短期執業嘅，咁誒而同時咧，佢哋亦都可以咧係誒。

423
01:31:52,250 --> 01:32:12,260
業界個溝通嘅時候咧，都覺得呢個係誒一個誒好好嘅方式。咁當然我哋同時間咧誒，我哋亦都強調，我哋保留住個別產品個產地來源要求呢一個做法，因為有啲業界希望亦都係就因為個產品誒個有特殊之處，亦都希望就住佢。

424
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:42,500
係係，張議員，你咪繼續。啊，OK，咁誒，詳細資料嚇畀畀我啦，或者我再誒有機會直接同你哋個處負責同事再瞭解一下。噉啊，另外就係誒，我就想講個資格會認嘅。我想問嗱，我而家見到咧，第啱啱嗰。

425
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:34,780
係，處長係誒誒，多謝議員啱呢個。當然亦都係啊，同界別誒去商量嗰個結果嚟嘅。咁當然都係界界別去爭取。事實上，我哋頭先列舉嗰啲咧，係嗰啲啊資格互認嗰度嗰啲協，當年嘅協議咧，係一個屆滿期限。

426
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:54,790
期限咁呢個期限過咗啦，就點咧未有處理。咁而家有個處理啦，就可以有個完續。噉我哋都注意得到，其實除咗誒喺機工程啦誒之外咧，有啲專業界別都有資格互認嘅安排。不過佢哋係冇一個所謂誒喪失時效期，咁嗰度就唔。

427
01:33:54,790 --> 01:34:14,800
唔唔唔冇一個所謂延續嘅問題，但係咧有喪失校期，有啲係比較早嘅咧。今次咧就一一次過咧，當然誒喺嗰個誒誒誒就會延續。咁但係喺對對誒細節嗰個接觸咧，我哋都係有賴嗰個界別與界別同佢對。

428
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,260
啊！

429
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,990
咁疫情第六項，其他事項。

430
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,100
啊！嗰個大人民幣啊！

431
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,540
誒，知唔知啊？你知唔知呢樣嘢啊？

432
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:37,040
委員有冇其他事項？如果冇嘅噉，我宣佈散會。多謝。

433
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:29,090
誒，如果冇委員再有提問嘅話咧，咁呢個議題就討論到呢度為止啦。好多謝曬咁多位政府嘅官員。

434
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:55,380
好似誒放寬到，sorry我一時唔記得幾多錢，八萬好似定係幾多嘅？誒誒誒，但係香港好似就未啊。

435
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:42,020
早輪咧就係誒呢個誒內地好似放寬咗，畀內地去澳門。

436
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:51,690
一百四十四小時嘅免簽證，同埋增加入境口岸區擴大停留嘅區域。我睇下啊，柯女士有冇咩補充？

437
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:40,920
參加內地嘅資格考試，咁合格嘅時候咧，亦都可以喺內地執業嘅。咁誒兩者咧就係前者，即係佢唔參加考試就短期可以執業，係咪啊？係啦，即係唔需要考試，佢都可以短期執業嘅。O K。

438
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:34,810
口嘅接觸，因為佢哋係個專業啊，最清楚嘅專業嗰個要求。咁但係我哋係會做一個統籌同埋誒便捷啊嗰個角色嘅，會配合同埋誒提供所有嗰個即係誒即係可以誒做嘅誒配合咧，都會配合得到噉。

439
01:34:48,390 --> 01:35:08,400
嗱，呢幾個月開始咧就啊，內地嘅嗯，即係啊求診啊嚇，有段時間好多內地人中意嚟香港求診嘅。咁但係呢幾個月咧就陸續有減少咗啦，噉樣噉就啊，然後我知道咧，而家內地咧。

440
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:28,410
有啲地方，大灣區啦，都諗住啦，可能會有機會開始一啲專係畀港人嘅醫院啊，嚇噉啊，自然咧就會有港人醫生過去啦，嚇咁而家咧香港嘅醫生去內地執業嘅情況如何咧？即係佢哋係咪可以就咁去到內地嘅一啲醫院就可以執業？

441
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:48,420
可以嚇做醫生嘅工作咧，係主席。我即係請啊一陣間啊，陳先生幫我誒補充一下。但係執業之餘咧，就係去開醫院啦，即係開唔開得？而家咧，香港嗰個誒，譬如香港醫療機構咧，已經可以喺內地咧獨資。

442
01:35:48,420 --> 01:36:08,430
開醫療機構嘅啦，咁呢個我哋其實都有好多間開咗，噉就誒當然亦都可以合資啦，咁但係咧獨資係得嘅，而事實上亦都開咗有，亦都有有開咗好好大規模，以致到上市都有，咁誒或者喺但係喺醫療人員嘅資格嗰度，我睇。

443
01:36:41,430 --> 01:37:01,440
啊！多謝主席。好啊，我我最後問埋一個問題啊，主席嗱，因為我我哋誒早期咧，我哋都有同誒誒呢個誒工業處都傾咗，因為我哋好希望咧就係誒嗰個簽證啊，即係而家好多外國人咧就經香港咁咧就中意去內地。

444
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:21,450
旅遊嘅咁咧，我哋咧就誒曾經希望咧就係能夠傾一傾，有冇可能咧就係啊，即係譬如話係即係呢一個一百四十四小時個免簽證個政策嚇。而家嗰個誒下一輪係咪會喺下一輪傾咧，或者而家係咪傾緊咧？

445
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:41,610
嚇！多謝主席。誒，張議員頭先都觸及咗啦，我哋都介紹咗係今次裏邊已經納入咗㗎啦嘅政策嘅政策入咗入嚟㗎啦。咁咧就嗰個方向就話誒喺優化由香港入境嘅外國旅行團進入珠三角地區同埋汕頭市停留。

446
01:37:51,970 --> 01:38:11,980
誒，多多謝多謝主席，多謝張議員。其實正如頭先處長講，其實而家Super下面咧，已經有兩個政策。最新呢個政策咧，就進一步開放。就頭先張議員提嗰個便利簽證，其實都仲要係攞攞個簽證，就透過香港嘅旅行社幫啲外國嘅團隊做一個簽證入去內地。而而家。

447
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:31,990
新嘅政策再開放到咧，係唔需要簽證、免簽，所以係一步一步再就係打開個門户，希望做得更加好，多再令到多啲外國旅客會透過香港嚟到進入內地，包括大灣區嗰個城市去旅遊。多謝。嚇！啊，另外再再問多一個好快嘅，咁咧就。

448
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:21,390
主席，我諗我同撕牌冇關嘅，依家唔係依家都係撕牌有關噉啊，兩地啊嘛。嗯，嚇，我哋而家講緊啊，close啊嘛，close啊，誒誒E.P.A.嘛，係咪嚇？誒嗰個或者我之後再再再再傾，之後再傾，周Sir，唔該，主席。好好。

449
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:42,070
唔該曬。
