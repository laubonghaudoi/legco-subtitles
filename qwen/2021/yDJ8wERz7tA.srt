1
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,030
判決。

2
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,370
落實嘅。

3
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,460
是講。

4
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,020
誒，各位。

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,980
去點樣去？

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,920
香港嘅社會。

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,470
喺過去依幾年咧。

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,880
愛國者自講嘅原則。

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,880
做好一國兩制全面。

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,900
都遇到唔少風浪。

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,920
議會秩序咧，亦都受到影響。

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,070
啊，保龍主任喺講話中提到愛國者。

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,970
喺政治上、經濟同民生。

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,270
係重新以故國家領導人鄧小平先生。

15
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,850
全國港澳研究所會啊，今日喺網上係舉行研討會啦。

16
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:17,520
而國務院港澳辦主任夏寶龍咧，亦都發表咗講話，係解釋咗。

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,990
都係。

18
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,750
愛國。

19
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,720
身處重要崗位嘅人士。

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
同埋合理嘅要求。

21
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,190
係都係理解同埋包容。

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,310
亦都有廣闊嘅政治光譜。

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,320
亦都作為管治香港最基本。

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,640
香港係多元嘅社會。

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,320
一早已經提出愛國者嘅標準。

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,670
我認為喺呢個時候做咧係有必要嘅。

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,510
目的係要理順現制嘅秩序。

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,410
亦都係相信大部分香港人咧，會繼續秉承。

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,050
事實上，好多國家嘅政權架構之中。

30
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,770
中央係對於香港社會有唔同取態嘅聲音咧。

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,270
愛國嘅嚟擔任，依個係一個好基本管治嘅原則。

32
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:29,310
完善一國兩制嘅方針係有利保障香港長期繁榮穩定嘅發展，市民生活安定。

33
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,020
撥單。

34
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,820
係，所以咧。

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,220
and.

36
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,770
我平川度。

37
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,290
any country.

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,270
會被迫去。

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,280
legislators.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,300
I think the basic principle is very simple.

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,150
forward election reforms. Do you think that can really satisfy what?

42
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,090
going to a whole high office must.

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,890
我亦都理解社會對完善選舉制度。

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,380
嘅者嘅立場，去積極參與治理香港。

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,350
去確保香港嘅選舉制度更順利地向前發展。

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,460
universal truth and simple logic is that those who

47
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,330
當 people talk about electoral reform, they are hoping that people can get to elect their own chief executive.

48
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:28,540
有一直有唔同嘅聲音，我相信中央亦都會聽取香港各界唔同嘅意見。

49
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,750
OK。

50
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,170
誒。

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,890
Any views?

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,760
to their own country.

53
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,410
You can have.

54
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,530
誒，look at誒。

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,350
and if you.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,500
It's quite important that.

57
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,340
他 mention that you know, as long as you are patriotic.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,490
by this his speech, outlining the.

59
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,340
Mr. House speech.

60
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,330
你認為人民會有任何 say in how the election reform how how the election reform will go forward? If no, is that fair to people?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,170
love their country, patriotic to the country, not you know become an enemy.

62
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:15,910
red line， if you call it， or the basic principle of you know people holding high office in Hong Kong。

63
00:03:49,690 --> 00:04:01,920
Okay, and the spectrum, as I mentioned, the particle spectrum can be as wide as possible. So I think I have no doubt that you know.

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:37,880
我係 sure that you know all the Hong Kong people will have a say, and in his speech, he also mentioned that he will listen to Hong Kong people's view. So I have no doubt about that.

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,410
O.K.好，唔該曬。
