1
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,830
啊！

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,630
就誒。

3
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,090
唔需要。

4
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,030
嚇！所以我再問一問啫。

5
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,810
因為上一次有啲委員係提過嘅。

6
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,630
第一，競爭事務委員會嘅工作報告。

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,480
第二咧，香港車用燃油嘅價格。

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,930
誒語言，我哋時間到啦，亦都夠人數，我哋就誒開會啦嚇。

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,320
嗱，請問啊，議員對以上兩個討論嘅事項，誒有冇意見啊？

10
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:28,470
好啦，第三個疫情，香港迪士尼樂園度假區嘅最新進展嘅報告，我哋請觀唸入場啊，唔該。

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:20,160
今日第一個議程咧，就係上一次嘅會議後發出嘅諮詢文件。噉啊，大家都已經知道列喺嗰個議程上邊嘅啦。

12
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:31,790
啊！即即呢個討論，我講嘅咧就係競爭事務委員會參加我哋討論關呢個事項咧，就係香港嘅車用燃料嘅價格，需唔需要競爭委員會嚟？

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:11,360
啊，是否要需要我咧？上一次聽過有啲誒委員會想啊，即係話呢個競請競爭事務委員會參與上述嘅議題，大家需唔需要？

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:17,380
好多時競爭事務委員會都比較都都嘗試積極去處介入處理啦，噉我覺得就誒應該要叫埋佢哋嚟一齊討論嘅喎。如果係都，我嘅意見係咁啦。唔該。啊，我就叫秘書誒發信邀請佢哋啦嚇。

15
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:40,690
題議題二咧，就下一次嘅會議嘅討論嘅事項。噉啊，事務委員會下一次例會咧，就定喺二零二一年六月二十八日星期一上晝嘅十點四十五分舉行。噉啊，政府咧建議討論咧以下嘅兩個項目。

16
00:01:42,490 --> 00:02:02,500
哦，誒，周浩鼎主席，如果係討論，剛才我聽你講係講緊係討論嗰啲油價嘅監督嘅問題咧，係，我覺得其實競爭事務委員會都可以嚟出席嘅，因為事實上過去嗰個關於油價成日都講合謀定價，誒，成日都講話點解啲油價加快減慢啊嗰啲咧？

17
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,020
誒迪士尼咧，另外一個誒。

18
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,640
咁所以其實佢面對嘅挑戰係既要克服，即係唔能夠。

19
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,610
即係過一年裏面咧，誒迪士尼樂園嗰個誒經營情況好嘛？

20
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,920
誒喺情況許可，喺防疫工作做得好嘅大前提之下咧，佢亦都爭取咧係誒有。

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:41,830
即係如果觀如果誒呢個觀念發現之後咧，就大家誒禁制咧需要發現嘅就禁制啦，唔該。

22
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:53,700
係對香港即係嗰個誒經濟係帶來一個正面嘅影響咧，亦都係令到佢原來嘅員工可以繼續去工作，亦都咧，尤其是喺誒。

23
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:17,480
先生咧就旅遊專業專員啦，誒穆偉庭咧就係行政總裁咧，黎佩珊女士咧就前信同埋公共事務副總裁咧。

24
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:31,360
咁而家我哋誒請政府官員誒誒呢個商務及經濟發展局誒邱騰華先生咧，向我哋作一個簡單嘅誒報告啦，好嗎？

25
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:49,190
到咧迪士尼樂園同埋其他一啲即係誒誒大型嘅呢類嘅樂園咧，都係持守住佢哋同我哋一齊去誒做防疫抗疫嘅工作。

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:03:04,040
噉啊！我今日簡單咧介紹下出席嘅官員啦。邱騰華咧就係商務及經濟發展局局長咧。沈鳳君女士咧就係旅遊事務專員啦。鍾允妮女士咧就旅遊業副專員啦。賴志軒。

27
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:52,530
誒早晨，主席，各位委員，早晨。誒，今日我聯同誒香港迪士尼樂園度假區嘅公司，誒同大家作即係週年嗰個即係彙報，翻即係香港迪士尼樂園，即係喺過往一年嗰個誒營運嘅情況。大家都清楚啦，即係過往呢一年係可以話係歷史。

28
00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:12,540
史上最困難嘅一年，因為喺遊客數字跌咗八至九成，甚至九成九嘅情況。誒，樂園亦都係個入場人數咧，係跌咗超過七成。而中間呢段時間裏面咧，舊年至今咧，如果以舊年成年嚟嚟計咧，誒，不單止即係。

29
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:35,590
即係誒樂園咧，都係有三分二嘅時間咧，係因為疫情嘅關係咧而要被逼關閉嘅。咁所以喺噉嘅情況之下咧，誒迪士尼樂園嘅經營係面對即係一個好大嘅困難。但係縱然係噉樣嘅時候咧，誒我哋都係好樂意見。

30
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:18,240
任何時間能夠開放嘅時候咧，都能夠開放。但係佢哋都係符合翻，即係政府對佢哋要求。例如喺不同時間，佢開開誒將個樂園開誒，即係入畀幾多人去入去啊？或者喺入去嘅時候咧，所有防疫嘅工作都係做到要百分百嘅。

31
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:43,230
即係開園接受誒遊客入去呢個情況，但係亦都要應對咧，就係可以繼續營運時間嚟講咧，佢未必係可以百分之百咧按照原先嗰個情況去營運嘅。咁但係誒喺呢方面嚟講咧，誒樂園能夠即係繼續去營運開放咧，不單止係。

32
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:14,120
誒困難嘅疫情當中咧，誒提供咗一個即係喘息嘅機會畀市民咧，誒一家大細咧可以喺誒情況許可嘅時候咧，可以入去即係散下心、開心玩一玩。咁所以呢個係大致上嘅情況，我就誒如果係咁咧，我交翻畀行政總裁咧，係同大家報告。

33
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,690
唔該。

34
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,080
The resort has transformed.

35
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,710
OK，一。

36
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,200
Our priorities are now clear.

37
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,500
偉霆先生，啊，行政總裁。

38
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,910
We also look forward to the return of tourists to Hong Kong.

39
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,390
and all the while preserving jobs and cash.

40
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,910
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, panel members, for your time today.

41
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,720
That is bringing Hong Kong closer to the Greater Bay Area and other regional markets.

42
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,620
Our all-new innovative offerings have also proven to be extremely popular.

43
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,290
as we explore all possible ways to generate revenue, while prudently managing costs.

44
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,610
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention how humbled I am by everyone's appreciation on our efforts to preserve jobs.

45
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,960
There are huge opportunities for us to tap post-post-endemic, thanks to the infrastructure.

46
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,310
We want the resort to stay open, and are doing our best to drive local visitation both now and in the times to come.

47
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,620
I'd like to start by discussing our plans for recovery, along with some exciting new news about our latest products and guest offerings.

48
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:22,390
Our new icon, the reimagined Castle of Magical Dreams, which has doubled in height, marks the transformation of the entire resort over the last fifteen years.

49
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,540
And net loss was 2.7 billion.

50
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,730
我們係一part of the fabric of the city since we've opened.

51
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,960
我們係 well placed to tap into the great potential ahead.

52
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
per capita spending fell 18% year on year.

53
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,810
and we remain committed to adding value to the community we live in.

54
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,190
and do not necessarily provide a meaningful reference to our future potential.

55
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,620
我們克服障礙，一起在過去，和會做，所以，在未來。

56
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,490
as we begin to recover, our contributions to the local economy will only increase.

57
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,720
yet，when you look at the adjusted capacity under our health and safety measures。

58
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,610
With our incredible brands, our stories, immersive experiences and talented cast.

59
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,000
due to the adverse market conditions, revenue was down 76% to 1.4 billion.

60
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,550
Before we continue, I want to note that our financial numbers reflect the nature and impact of the global pandemic.

61
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't think this comes as a surprise to anyone, but I wanted to make sure that we said this before we get through the financial figures.

62
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,120
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and the amortisation was negative 1.5 billion.

63
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:04,350
With no inbound tourism, overall hotel occupancy was 15% compared to 74 in the prior year.

64
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,820
但 per room guest spending increased by 22%, driven by higher local guest spending on food and beverage and merchandise in our hotels.

65
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,340
但係，我 believe 我哋 on the way back up again.

66
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,720
and our hotels operated with adjusted levels of service.

67
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,700
Here are some examples on what we are doing right now as we turn the corner.

68
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,720
我們也實施了嚴格的容量控制和社交距離措施。

69
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,910
and we saw a 15% increase in local attendance per average operating day.

70
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,340
The resort registered hotel utilisation rate of 34%.

71
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,590
needless to say, the pandemic has had a huge impact on the figures I just discussed.

72
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,020
this said，the park was closed for almost 60% of the fiscal year，or seven months.

73
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,630
Theme park attendance was 1.7 million, a drop of 73% compared to prior year.

74
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,900
navigating through the pandemic has been like riding a roller coaster. The business went down last year.

75
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,680
我們 rolled out new merchandise and food and beverage offerings and programmes， which have improved our per capita spending。

76
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,260
我們 grateful to have earned the trust and confidence of our local guests， which made up three quarters of our attendance mix。

77
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,590
With a significant drop in overnight visitation to Hong Kong, we've had to shift our focus solely to the local market.

78
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,890
We've also ventured into new channels to sell our products, from online sales platforms to our first-ever pop-up stores in town.

79
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,330
一hot item this year has been our headbands, which are now the perfect must-have accessory for guests wearing masks when taking photos.

80
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:33,300
and since the park's opening in 2005, total cumulative attendance has reached more than 85 million, which speaks to our long-term commitment and contribution as a key pillar of Hong Kong tourism.

81
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,480
coming to the resort.

82
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,050
The magic is still here.

83
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,030
它 feels like travel without travelling.

84
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,200
The two plus one ticket offer.

85
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,230
我們 grateful that local residents are choosing us.

86
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,000
Our team has also worked tirelessly to offer guests.

87
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,650
我們知道香港迪士尼是 offering 某樣 unique 在 market。

88
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,110
with all paid and free recreational options available.

89
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,520
The group of three and group of four offers for Hong Kong residents performed particularly well.

90
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,260
Our Magic Access program saw its membership base further expand by eight percent during fiscal two thousand and twenty.

91
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,920
And I'd like to take my hat off to our wonderful cast for maintaining the Disney magic under this new normal.

92
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,920
平均成員 attendants 增加了 30% 每營運日，相較於前一年。

93
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:02,180
Guest experiences in a new way, including selfie spots around the park where guests can take photos with their favourite characters at an appropriate distance.

94
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:25,580
We could not be more proud that we have been able to preserve jobs for our 7,000 cast members, while revenue while managing revenues and expenses.

95
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:13,220
While it's encouraging that our local guests are enjoying Hong Kong Disneyland like never before, local attendance is far from enough to compensate for the significant drop in tourism arrivals.

96
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:46,230
We also actively promoted staycation opportunities, not to mention celebratory packages, themed bundles, and hotel recreational activities that have enticed locals even further.

97
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,600
和回歸的遊客到香港。

98
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,340
它會 be 嚴重依賴於 us  staying open。

99
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,570
And this is a figure that's double that of 2007.

100
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,810
and created over two hundred and seventy-one thousand jobs.

101
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,230
一些 key 動作包括實施 unpaid 假。

102
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,490
它係 amazing to see how our cast members have shown understanding.

103
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,410
reduce marketing spending and cancellation of special events.

104
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,230
In our part, our participation in the government's employee support scheme.

105
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,420
equivalent to 0.31% of the city's GDP.

106
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,930
The implementation of a five-day per week operation since September.

107
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,380
Despite these efforts, for the resort's financial position to greatly improve.

108
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,140
Our total costs and expenses decreased by two billion dollars, or 41%.

109
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,890
dedication and commitment in light of our cost management and our job preservation efforts.

110
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:34,010
在過去15年份的operations combine，The resort has brought 113.7 billion dollars of added value to the local economy.

111
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:54,440
As shown in a Hong Kong Tourism Board survey, 60% of our long our non-local guests cited the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort as the prime reason to visit Hong Kong during fiscal 19.

112
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:25,550
Hong Kong has Hong Kong Disneyland has built a strong foundation over the past 15 years, and we are a part of Hong Kong, its growth and its people, and we remain committed to adding value to the community that we live in.

113
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,200
looking into the future.

114
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,350
通過社區支援Programs。

115
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,910
and we are determined to continue contributing to Hong Kong in the future.

116
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,180
partnering with Foodlink Foundation since 2013.

117
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,610
It has surely made our non-local fans very jealous, as they haven't been able to see it yet.

118
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,040
We know that this time, this is when families and children need Disney magic the most.

119
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,500
We've donated more than 200,000 meals cumulatively through the end of fiscal 2020.

120
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,810
它成為一個標誌性的背景，讓我們當地的遊客拍攝照片並在社交媒體上分享。

121
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,380
我們也確保我們繼續我們對當地社區的承諾，即使在疫情打亂。

122
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,670
not only does the Newcastle symbolise the positive attributes of hope, courage and possibility.

123
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,420
The Newcastle of Magical Dreams, our most eye-catching centerpiece, was completed in last November.

124
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,820
我們工作過超過200個組織，來提供超過80,000張免費票。

125
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:59,800
as well as sharing festive treats to children and families, especially during the school closure period, due to the pandemic.

126
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:05,200
我們知道，我們係一個關鍵的旅遊基礎設施，一個驅動旅遊到來和一個就業創建者。

127
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:33,910
它也提醒我們，現在度假村本身已經完全轉型，有了更大的足跡、新酒店和新吸引力和娛樂。

128
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:42,540
By moving our community services online, we've been able to contribute 4,400 hours of volunteering services during the fiscal year.

129
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,260
taking this opportunity.

130
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,570
both electric and magnetic.

131
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,650
which we have started drawing on earlier this year.

132
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,810
exciting and attracting tourists from far and wide.

133
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,340
我們知道世界 wants to reopen， and our guests are eager to return.

134
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,470
As we took a look at all of these efforts, they have helped us sustain our business and protect jobs.

135
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,900
We will remain a key part of how together we can bring back tourism into the Hong Kong tourism industry.

136
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,380
我 must thank all of the support from the government, Legco members, businesses and other industry stakeholders.

137
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,360
我 also want to update the panel that our all-new daytime castle show Follow Your Dreams will be officially launched on June 30th.

138
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,530
All our transformative steps over the past 15 years have allowed us to continue being a new icon of Hong Kong tourism.

139
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,810
We have an extremely strong brand, along with a management great management team, supported by thousands of talented cast members.

140
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:37,010
The facility is a great demonstration of the unwavering commitment the Walt Disney Company has in supporting the local community here in Hong Kong.

141
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:26,080
我應該也強調，華特迪士尼公司已提供全額支持給度假村，由提供2.1億美元的翻新設施。

142
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:56,760
And it's clear during our reopening day back in February, you could see the excitement and the happiness on the on the guest face, as they entered the gates of the park.

143
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:09,430
The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated over its hundred-year history that it is exceptionally resilient, and during these challenging times, it's been no different.

144
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:58,060
With our beautiful beautiful castle as the backdrop, this exciting 20-minute stage show will be filled with unforgettable music and performances, treating guests to a magical musical journey, ushering in a new era in the resort.

145
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,310
兼職。

146
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
誒迪士尼係冇用盡嘅。

147
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,710
Now I look forward to responding to the members' questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

148
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,130
It is our wish to see Hong Kong tourism shine again in the region.

149
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,110
陳議員、林建峯議員、謝偉全議員、周浩鼎議員。

150
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:09,360
鄭松泰議員、姚思榮議員，誒第一位係陸仲雄議員，唔該。

151
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:24,480
噉我知道一樣嘢咧，就係其實而家政府容許迪士尼嗰個入場人數嘅上限咧。

152
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:50,170
噉我想了解，即係同上次溝通時間有少少即係時間啦，已經係。我想問，而家係咪都係冇裁到員？

153
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:17,530
多謝主席。噉我早前咧都同誒迪士尼咧嘅誒公司嘅代表咧都係溝通過嘅。

154
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:42,420
咁喺早前咧，我同迪士尼誒公司代表溝通嘅時候咧，佢就話咧誒冇裁過員嘅喺個疫情期間，噉啊至多都係放下無薪假。

155
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,870
冇用盡嘅原因咧，就係佢哋話嗰個餐飲嘅安排做唔到，因為有嗰個誒社交距離限制，同埋嗰個餐廳嘅嗰個入座嘅比例有個限制。

156
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:51,460
噉我覺得呢個咧係一個比較可惜嘅情況嚟嘅，即係誒令到我第一個就想問啦，即係喺啊假日嘅情況啦，會有係咪會有人因此而入唔到樂園玩咧？

157
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:58,530
好，我哋好多謝啊，莫偉霆先生嘅報告咧。咁而家咧，誒，我哋有七位個議員啊，臨終想發言嘅。噉啊，時間上我諗係每個四分鐘啦。我先讀讀嗰個次序，好唔好？第一個陸仲行議員，田北。

158
00:18:51,740 --> 00:19:11,750
第二個咧就係誒，可唔可以樂園可以做一啲臨時嘅誒供餐飲嘅地方，即係樂園附近或者裏邊有冇一啲即係閒置嘅地方可以做呢樣嘢，令到咧樂園嗰個嘅入場人數咧可以即係用到盡政府畀佢嗰個嘅規範，而增加嗰個收入。

159
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:31,760
噉我增加收入咧，其實誒我係好擔心同好關注一個角度嘅，為咗係咩咧？為咗裏邊咧，誒差唔多八千位嘅員工，咁裏邊咧有大概我知道係有五千八百幾個嘅全職啦，同埋咧有千幾名嘅誒兼職工嘅，因為五千三百個嘅全職同埋一千八百名嘅。

160
00:19:50,870 --> 00:20:10,880
同埋最新咧放呢個無薪假嘅安排點樣？冇裁到員警師係包括全職兼職都冇裁到啊？定係誒兼職佢係點樣處理嘅咧？而家係因為我哋都係作為工會咧，係最關心嗰個員工嘅飯碗嘅問題。最後咧都係同員工有關嘅問題，就係想了解下咧誒迪士尼。

161
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,580
多謝主席。

162
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,310
行政總裁。

163
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,040
心係會大啲嘅，唔該，主席。

164
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,460
and we're also working with.

165
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
the as it relates to the vaccination.

166
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,770
as as our one of our primary objectives has been to preserve jobs.

167
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,840
pay and time off in order to get vaccinated.

168
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:42,860
誒第一部分個問題咧，就誒陸議員嗰個提法係即係擔心話，即係譬如喺樂園裡面，既然個樂園可以開到百分之七十五。

169
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:48,840
As it relates to our cast members, it is true that we have not had any layoffs, and we currently do not have any plans to lay off cast members.

170
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:24,830
our cast members to provide incentives to make it easier for them to be vaccinated, including special payments for

171
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:11,760
We are taking full steps right now to make sure that 100% of our casts are being tested every two weeks, which is above the statutory requirement. We have also educational programmes that we put in place.

172
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:38,580
We did indeed have to increase the number of food carts, the operating hours of the food and beverage locations, in order to fully satisfy the food and beverage demand that we did have in the in the park, and that was something that we were able to turn around just frankly in a matter of days.

173
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:21,880
First, I'd like to address the question about capacity. Clearly, when the park was at 50% capacity and food and beverage also at 50% capacity, we did have a match, if you will. If we look at what happened after the events, when park capacity was increased to 75%.

174
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:30,890
公司咧有冇任何嘅措施咧，去鼓勵同事接種疫苗，包括為佢哋安排即係疫苗假期，因為誒始終係服務性行業啦。如果樂園裏邊嘅員工絕大多數都係注射咗疫苗嘅話咧，相信對誒市民咧入園咧去即係即係玩咧係會有信。

175
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:54,030
誒係啊，局長誒誒，你嗰個擴大個飲食地方同埋打疫苗啊，誒呢個樂眾行醫院嘅問題嚇。主席誒，我我畀我先畀樂源答誒第二至第四條問題先啦。我誒翻返嚟誒一陣，樂源即係第一條問題嚇。好，入Michael。

176
00:22:43,140 --> 00:23:03,150
誒，但係裡面嘅食市餐廳就只可以百分之五十。咁呢個係誒，其實誒係由政府即係定出嚟嘅，因為譬如喺個樂園裡面咧，誒雖然佢做足曬所有嗰啲防疫措施啊，即係做檢查等等，但係佢裡面嘅食市基本上嗰個營營運咧同。

177
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,260
各位主席。

178
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,050
嗱，過去十年咧，主席。

179
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,200
好，下一位係田北辰議員，唔該。

180
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,220
防疫嘅大前提之下，許可嘅時候咧，我哋都會檢視個情況。嚇，唔該。

181
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,880
我再睇低營運開支包括乜咧？就係話薪金。

182
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,110
嗱，EBITDA咧，其實咧喺總收入減營運開支嚟嘅啫。

183
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:32,340
直線下降咧，跌到咧就去蝕十五億，即係來回就廿六億。

184
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:26,390
但係去年咧就打禍啦，由前年嘅十一億嘅ebitda咧。

185
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:09,380
噉我睇翻過去兩年嘅變化咧，佢總收入跌咗七成半，但係營運開支咧只減少四成。

186
00:24:50,310 --> 00:25:00,510
當然，如果你要交租，但係業主唔揾減租，咁咪死路一條啦。咁但係迪士尼咧並冇呢一個死症。點解Ebiter會是十五億咧？

187
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:20,000
我計過，如果營運開支都可以減少七成半嘅話咧，EBIT咧竟然係可以係一個正數嘅，正二點二億嘅。

188
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:19,700
誒年年嘅ebit都係正數嘅，就算二零一零年啊破紀錄淨虧損七點二億，ebit都有正二億。

189
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:49,960
任何企業喺疫情期間，因為控制唔到嘅收入，只有就控制營運開支，無求做到收入跌幾多成，營運開支就減幾多成。

190
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:18,770
同翻我哋普遍喺坊間見到嘅食市都係相近嘅，咁所以一切喺食市嗰種要求，誒近期我哋其實都有誒放鬆咗啲啦，即係譬如話，如果係個食市員工如果有多人接種嘅時候咧，咁亦都有即係誒。

191
00:23:49,690 --> 00:24:05,870
香港迪士尼嘅將來撇除再嚟立法會攞錢啊，局長就好睇現金流轉嘅情況。而個關鍵咧就係每年嘅EBIT，即係未扣除利息折舊同埋攤銷前嘅盈利。

192
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:39,060
誒可以多啲嘅人數等等，咁恐怕喺呢方面嚟講咧，我哋暫時未必可以話，因為樂園佢係可以開到百分之七十五，而咧將佢裏面嘅食肆完全調校，因為噉樣就變咗係即係同其他喺坊間嘅食肆誒唔看齊。咁但係當然咧，即係我哋同衞生當局都經常都討論嘅。如果係情況喺房。

193
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,580
過去嗰個廿九億減到十五億。

194
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,130
咁所以我想問下總裁，你個逼單係點嘅？

195
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,270
for next year's budget to achieve breakeven and Ibita for next year, are you willing to do that?

196
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:57,790
你營運開支嘅誒，而家嗰條數咧係廿九億。

197
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,350
係咪？咁但係佢呢兩個嘅開支嘅範疇，每一個開支跌咗幾多成？我想知呢樣嘢。

198
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:32,600
加一大抽嘢，就係營運費用、加銷售成本、加市場推廣、加營銷費用。

199
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,290
excuse me, I have only 30 minutes left. Can you directly respond to my question? Do you have the breakdown of the operating expenses?

200
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:11,540
O K，噉啊，總裁唔該，嗰個營運開支同埋嗰個總收嘅唔平衡，點樣解決？

201
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:23,450
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, the balance of providing a park experience that's worthy of

202
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:08,010
到底你薪金同埋另外嗰堆嘢咧嘅跌幅，比起一年前係點樣樣？嗱，總數就跌咗四成啊！

203
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:03,620
啊，國長唔該。唔係國長啊，我想問啊，總裁。啊，主席，我想啊，行政總裁回答。啊，呢啲一定係總裁嘅事。好。國長好無辜啊！

204
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:52,430
如果你減到十五億咧，即係就算未來一年好處過去一年嘅總收入咁咧，你都可以打喎。噉我第二個問題就係你有冇用呢個營運開支係十五億作為一個底線去計劃你未來一年？

205
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:08,690
Management company is focusing all efforts right now on doing everything to increase revenue and manage costs as low as possible. Can you give me a precise answer whether you are able to reduce your operating expenses by half next year?

206
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:46,880
咁理應咧嗱，薪金就好多時放緊無薪假啦。咁另外嗰堆嘢咧，應該就算你誒減唔到啊，九成都減到七成本啦。噉我睇唔到點解營運開支淨可以減到四成？

207
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:48,410
That information is something that we, if it's not included in the, okay. Can you please submit it in writing later on? And also, can you set reducing the operating expenses by half?

208
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:35,940
咁第二咧就係展望將來啦，未來一年啦，我就希望你咧就尋求Ebita咧係打和嘅打和啫啊，打和啫，唔使賺錢嘅。就算Ebita打和咧都係淨虧損都成十幾億㗎啦。如果你Ebita打和咧，你就要將你嘅營運開支由個

209
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,540
上嘅時間。

210
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,910
你唔可以畀我任何嘢肯定。

211
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,110
我問你，你係唔係願意設定咗作為你的目標？

212
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,320
Our goal is to do everything we can to preserve jobs and cash.

213
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,260
Right now it's at two point nine billion. I'm looking for one point five.

214
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,790
我係問緊你，係唔係？

215
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,250
你 realise this is not a very good attitude for your first showing at letto， right？

216
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,870
我 believe that if you reduce by one point five， you can achieve even a neater。

217
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,540
我 can tell you what I can control right now is we're doing everything we. no, you cannot control the revenue, but you can control expenses, right?

218
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:31,650
Mr. Mariti, do you know your numbers at all? How come you can't even give me a ballpark?

219
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:25,680
主席，如果你同意，我不如啊，國長想補充一下，國長。如果啊，田議員唔反對嘅時候咧，我想我想補充少少啦。誒，政府都有睇即係迪士尼嗰盤數。我諗即係從啊田議員即係在商言商嘅角度，當然即係開源節流，天公地道嘅啦。生意少咗幾多，咪cut幾多咯噉樣樣。咁但係誒，大家喺我開

220
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:45,690
開場白嘅時候都講明喺降呢一年裏面咧，其實都唔限於迪士尼咧，好多其他嘅商業運作嘅機構都係啦。最大嘅困難第第一咧就係誒遊客係冇咗嘅，差唔多接近零。咁呢個係同以往即係迪士尼經營嘅時候咧，大部分嘅旅客嚟自誒遊客係出現一個好大。

221
00:29:45,690 --> 00:30:05,700
啊！落差，但係呢部分反而咧，就喺呢段時間裏面咧，本地嗰個人嗰個誒遊客人數係增加咗、補足咗。但係，我覺得最大嘅困難喺邊度咧？未必可以完全滿足到阿田議員所謂啊！你即係收入跌咗幾多，你又減幾多成本，就係佢冇一個誒穩定性喺度。譬如如果回想翻嚟，即係。

222
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:25,710
將心比己，喺舊年誒疫情之後，每一次我哋要關閉個樂園嘅時候咧，包括政府、包括社會、包括業餘人都冇人能夠講得到幾時可以畀佢重開。而實際上，舊年以誒年歷嚟計咧，二零二零年咧兩個樂園都係啦，百分之六十二。

223
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:46,850
係關閉咗嘅。咁喺嗰段時間理論上咧，就係如果係噉嘅時候，你咪cut開支。如果係噉嘅時候咧，就啊，如果喺嗰段時間，譬如話山嗰日，噉你啊你好難有個誒穩定性嘅時候，你唔可能喺嗰日就炒曬所有人，或者減刪曬所有開支。咁所以呢度係一定會有一個落差。噉我覺得呢一個係大家應該係理解。所以嗰個落差。

224
00:30:46,850 --> 00:31:06,860
部分原因就係呢一度嚟緊呢一年都係，所以點解我哋喺每一次誒，大家喺以往喺呢個議會上邊咧，都有好多時候督促政府就話，如果能夠喺經濟活動能夠重開嘅時候，儘量去重開，儘量畀到即係疑問者咧有一個即係誒方向，知道可以做得到。咁呢個亦～

225
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,040
而家咧仲夠錢使。

226
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,990
變身之後係點樣樣嘅？

227
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,950
樂園咧都算幾叻㗎啦。

228
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,140
啊！我希望咧。

229
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,940
啊！一啲防疫嘅工作。

230
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,600
依個城堡華麗。

231
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,140
我啊，好高興見到迪士尼樂園咧，就重開。

232
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,590
仲未要向政府攤大手板去。

233
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,480
噉我都好耐冇去啦，我亦都想去一去睇一睇。

234
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,100
啊！今次嘅重開咧，可以再為香港人帶嚟歡樂。

235
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,390
我明白係因為受到社會動盪同埋疫情嘅影響。

236
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:54,140
嗱，我哋誒即係話介紹嗰度咧，亦都講到迪士尼響二零二零年嘅財政年度咧，加加埋埋咧就蝕咗二十七億嘅。

237
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:22,090
誒，我亦都誒，從一啲朋友有去過迪士尼園誒，同埋啲孫仔啊、仔仔女女去嗰啲咧，佢哋都話咧，佢哋都做足咗。

238
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:24,770
都係我哋即係同誒迪士尼樂園在內嘅一啲商業機構咧，一齊去做嘅，即係能夠許可嘅時候咧，喺做足防疫嘅措施嘅時候，畀佢有一個誒確定性。但係局長啊，我只不過要求佢哋會唔會嚟緊一年啊，用十五億作為營運開支嘅目標啫嘛。

239
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,180
啊。

240
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,720
問題啦。

241
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,130
未來點樣？

242
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,150
誒，依依個問題。

243
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,900
美國迪士尼凍結。

244
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,120
啊！依個專利費用嘅。

245
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,270
噉我都想問一問咧，即係迪士尼。

246
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,740
誒，你會唔會要求？

247
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,000
誒，所謂融資啦。

248
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,590
噉啊！市民嘅生活咧，亦都慢慢回復正常。

249
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,180
就係響未來一年或者兩年咧。

250
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,760
就誒建議，就一個優惠嘅。

251
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,990
我哋誒最近咧，我我最近咧，亦都誒同一啲工商界嘅朋友咧。

252
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:08,320
因為以前我哋都提過㗎啦，啊，咁呢個咧係可以幫助到迪士尼嗰個支出㗎。

253
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:21,280
但係長久落去咧，依個都唔係辦法嚟㗎。咁而家社會開始回復穩定啦，疫情亦都開始受控。

254
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:43,040
啊！收支平衡，我就唔會問你攞到咁細節嘅，因為你畀唔到我嘅。你會問翻我轉頭，你係咪可以控制到疫情啊？係咪可以控制到啲遊客入嚟啊？噉我咧就想問一個。

255
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:45,710
你控制唔到收入，你控制到人民開支，你用十五億做目標，噉我都收貨啦。主席，我個我個我個頭先嗰個回答方法咧，就係話咧誒，因為政府都會睇住個盤數啦。但係我相信大家都會理解就係，如果用一個噉嘅硬性嘅數字嘅方式，就係如果用翻田議員所講，你個收入跌咗。

256
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,030
噉。

257
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,510
啊。

258
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,680
我覺得。

259
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,160
咁所以咧。

260
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,500
誒計劃啦。

261
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,580
Michael響介紹。

262
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,980
萬萬向復甦。

263
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,160
咁最尾。

264
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,180
迪士尼樂園咧都可以。

265
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,780
啊，今日嘅文件嗰度咧。

266
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,820
啊！多啲人去打針嚇。

267
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,450
咁工商界咧，嗰個反應都係非常之好嘅。

268
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,010
啊，擔任一個啊重要嘅角色㗎。

269
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,370
個業咧就係你講到要共同努力。

270
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,530
你希望幫助到香港，Together we are here to build the path of recovery。

271
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:32,720
亦都希望咧，可以幫助到香港個疫情穩定同埋。

272
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,070
多謝主席。

273
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,700
哦，總裁唔該。

274
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,590
係，之前我請啊總裁。

275
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,180
誒門票啊，或者優惠。

276
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,690
One of the things that I believe is very encouraging is, as we look forward to.

277
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,360
誒，我聯絡到好多工商界或者公營機構啦，佢哋都好樂意捐出一啲。

278
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:15,260
The border is opening up. We have to know how we're doing with our local guests.

279
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,150
你looking at the GBA, the infrastructure projects that have not been fully utilised yet.

280
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:40,900
啊，我覺得啊，你哋響應依一方面咧，會幫助到其他公司嘅支持嘅。多謝主席。

281
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:06,280
Not just what we're doing in Hong Kong right now and and the response that the local guests have had to us, but we also have a lot to look forward to with respect to what happens when the borders open up.

282
00:35:50,750 --> 00:36:03,190
So the first question was how are we looking at a recovery and how do we get into a better financial position? One of the things that I mentioned before is that we certainly need to stay open and we need to have the borders opened up.

283
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:33,100
噉啊，包括啊海洋公園啦。噉我想問一問迪士尼樂園，迪士尼樂園咧會唔會捐出一啲啊門票啊，或者一啲優惠？

284
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:28,770
since since their opening, in the way of the high-speed rail as well as the Macau-Juhi bridge, these are all bringing the 70 million people in the GBA within two hours of Hong Kong, and we're very excited about that.

285
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:47,680
And of course, I mentioned Hong Kong and then GBA, but also the third runway at the airport, also providing more lift for international travel into Hong Kong. These all are great signs for the future, and we are well positioned to capitalise on that growth.

286
00:31:45,710 --> 00:32:05,720
幾多？你個開支就一定係即係同等比值地誒減少咧。喺而家我哋面對呢個情況嚟講咧，未必可以做到。噉我希望係解釋到呢一方面。咁當然即係營運上面，我交翻畀樂源去做。唔該，主席。好嘅。誒，下一位係林建峯議員。唔該。誒，多謝主席。首先咧。

287
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:35,550
I couldn't be again humbled that the local guests are choosing us for paid and free recreational activities. Our local guest attendance for the first half of the year is 46% above prior year, and as I mentioned, our guest spending is also increased. And it's because guests are choosing us to become a place to.

288
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:55,560
celebrate their birthdays, their anniversaries, or just celebrating being together. It's it's evolved much more, much farther past than just a place to go where the newest or latest attraction is. It's more about it's a place to be and a place to enjoy time with friends and family. But as we look about.

289
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,820
as as mentioned.

290
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:33,230
Earlier in previous discussions, the management fees this year are zero.

291
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,220
唔該，主席專利費嗰個問題唔知係局長答，亦或係迪士尼園答啦。

292
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,720
誒，主席，我冇補充。頭先阿阿總裁所講嘅都係同我哋個立場一樣。OK。

293
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:24,240
The royalties aspect of it is a function of the use of intellectual properties, and the management fees are a function of performance.

294
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:41,970
Based on the performance of the of the company, as it relates to any change in that structure or the agreement, that really is a discussion for the shareholders.

295
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:15,850
As it relates to our royalties and management fee structure, as you know, there are two components. One, both are performance based.

296
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:47,140
誒嗱，而家仲有七個議員咧排緊隊嘅，噉我想提醒大家誒，大家保留喺個四分鐘，連問連答，唔該你。啊，而家係謝偉全議員。

297
00:39:47,420 --> 00:40:00,520
係多謝主席。噉啊，誒，舊年受到疫情嘅影響，誒，迪士尼嗰個收支平衡方面嘅表現咧，某個程度我係誒，即係喺呢方面係。

298
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:20,420
Now of thinking of what we can do next, not just for our cast but for our guests, including but not limited to some of the suggestions that that you have mentioned, and so we will be working on those and coming out with those in short order.

299
00:37:48,120 --> 00:38:05,780
When you bring into consideration all of those great things, how how we're doing with our local guests, the opportunities that we have that are uniquely Hong Kong, but also our expansion plans, we we we do believe that we will emerge from this stronger than than before.

300
00:38:43,070 --> 00:39:03,080
As it relates to the the vaccine and the question that you say yes, this is absolutely something that we have to do together. I mentioned some of the things that we are doing right now to make sure that our cast members are made aware and have the opportunities to be vaccinated. But we are in the process right now.

301
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:20,810
誒明白嘅噉，當然咧，即係好似局長講，大家都係希望啊，開源節流呢方面咧。咁節流方面有其他因素影響。咁喺開源方面咧，就誒都希望多做。我即係其實我睇到咧，其實喺呢個疫情之中咧，即係本地個遊客增長。

302
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:40,820
呢個係其實好嘅，因為尤其是喺疫情咧呢個大環境下咧，其實香港好多人都即係希望有啲即係假期有啲私會，或者平時都係噉啊。呢方面我覺得咧就可以多做。噉我睇到咧，其實主席就嗰個酒店嗰個入住率咧百分之十五文件，呢個似乎。

303
00:40:40,820 --> 00:41:00,830
咧同其他即係一般酒店嚟講咧，嗰個入住率嗰個比例係偏低。我哋感覺即係而家其實好好多人都希望咧，尤其是迪士尼咧，畀人感覺係一個即係誒去嗰度咧可以係比較輕鬆啲啊噉樣。咁喺呢方面咧，誒我都希望咧誒。

304
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,720
多謝，主席。

305
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,810
啊，行政總裁唔該。

306
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,130
has been improving.

307
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,670
我請，我請啊，總裁。

308
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,920
of regular paid guests, that is to say, our non magic access guests.

309
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:03,940
very successful, driving a lot of attendance. In fact, over the Easter holiday, we had our highest period ever of

310
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:23,450
問題而家即係呢廿億咧，嗰個情況係點樣？同埋嗰個誒，即係有冇有冇利息啊，或者償還方面係點樣情況咧？唔該，主席。

311
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:52,120
即係天氣咁熱咧，都好難嘅，就唔係咁理想一個活動。咁呢度係希望應用利用下晚間，尤其是入住酒店嗰度啦，噉。

312
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:20,840
即係誒迪士尼方面咧，可以多做，尤其是嚟緊即係天氣熱咧，多利用嗰啲晚間嘅個情況。誒有陣時入場，頭先局長講咗咧，即係飲食嘅問題咧，可能某個程度，就算好好多人上嘅時候，你都有個制詐喺度。咁喺個時間上嘅分配咧，可能會嚇。

313
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:40,850
考慮一下，你有一啲優惠嘅，即係附帶埋，即係利用酒店方面，我相信都係值得考慮。我唔知政府或者迪士尼方面喺呢方面係咪有喺呢度做多一啲咧，令到嗰個收入咧可以誒多啲，亦都可以幫到香港市民啦，好過佢哋成日都走去行山，而家行山。

314
00:41:52,400 --> 00:42:12,410
咁另外咧，當然我哋都關注咧，係誒而家佢嘅現金流呢啲事嚟嘅，急急跌到唔足十億啦，係咪？咁另外又文件有講咧，就話誒母公司咧，即個華特迪士尼嗰度咧，就有廿一億嘅週轉信貸。咁呢方面可唔可以講一講咧？嗰個信？

315
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:55,060
Really, two two big buckets of conversation here. First is as it relates to the revenue stream. As it relates to our vacation promotions, the two plus one magic and the three the three and the four offers have been.

316
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:29,260
Since two thousand and nine, I think speaking to the strength of those promotions. In addition, we also have summer promotions coming out shortly that I think everyone will be will be pleased with. The hotel occupancy last year at fifteen certainly was a function of.

317
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:49,270
The pandemic, the staycation packages that we have been offering today have also been very successful. Guests are telling us right now that staying at the hotel resort is like travelling without travelling. Whether it be Southern California or Southeast Asia, they really are transported away, and and our occupancy.

318
00:43:51,410 --> 00:44:11,420
The food and beverage discounts. Thank you very much for your consideration, and we will look into further food and beverage discounts. But what our guests are responding to are some of our new and innovative products, including celebrating some of our 150 award-winning dishes at the new food and drink fair that is going on.

319
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:31,430
Right now and proving to be very popular. But thank you for your suggestions on further discounts on that. As it relates to the the two one billion dollar revolver, we are we are certainly fortunate that the Walt Disney Company and all of our shareholders have are the full support or.

320
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,160
Okay, thank you.

321
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,980
係啊。

322
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,870
我係因為我

323
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:42,730
噉你哋個管理費咧，我哋知道咧就分兩部分嘅，誒一部分就係基本管理費。

324
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:52,450
噉啊，我就想問下，即係誒行政總裁呢方面會唔會有啲諗法或者誒計劃咁解啫？因為都係啦，唔該。

325
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:08,160
The rates that we're paying for the revolver right now are lower than the two shareholder loans that we have right now. Currently, the interest rate is a three-month LIBOR plus 1.25 percentage points.

326
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:36,140
係一位係周浩鼎議員，係係唔該啊，主席。咁當然即係係先黑暴後疫情，今年嘅嗰個迪士尼嘅誒表現，即係出現咗好大虧損，即係受到過去呢段時間咁重大嘅打擊咧，呢個我都可以理解嘅。

327
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:51,440
We have their full support. We have a plan right now, whereby we aren't going to be needing any additional funding beyond the existing revolver from the Walt Disney Company. As it relates to the rates which you asked for before, the rates that were

328
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:56,430
咁誒，當然咧，市民係亦都希望即係樂園同市民一齊都係共度時間啦。咁首先第一樣嘢咧，我就見到今日啊，總裁就頭先講咗嘅，就話咧即係五千三百個全職嘅員工加埋一千八百個兼職，噉就呢段時間咧，你哋都冇任何裁員嘅。噉我聽到呢個消息咧。

329
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:16,440
咧我都覺得比較，起碼我欣喜你哋冇做到裁員嘅安排咧，因為而家真係同市民共度時間，同基層嘅員工都應該要共度時間。咁反而我就想問下呢段時間嗰個相關放冇薪假嘅情況，究竟係點咧？即係我哋都期望你哋就算有放冇薪假，你都應該係一。

330
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:36,450
個好剋制嘅情況，去去用呢一個咁安排嘅噉，所以我想問清楚你哋喺放冇薪假嘅安排係點樣？咁第二個問題咧，我就想問今次我哋見到你嘅淨虧損廿六億啦，咁E B D A咧就係負十四億嘅。噉啊，過去咧咁多年咧，其實E B D A都係正數啦。

331
00:46:43,010 --> 00:47:03,020
一部分咧就係可變動管理費，咁都係基於EBITDA去做嘅。呢個零九年開始就係咁啦。噉我就想問一問咧，就係確認一下嘅啫。既然今年嘅EBITDA都係負數啦，咁理論上係咪應該你哋都冇再收取管理費咧？啊，不論係基本管理費或者。

332
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:23,030
可變動管理費，我只係想喺呢度咧就明確一下呢樣嘢，因為即係如果而家呢個時間大家咁艱難嘅時候，誒仲收管理費咧就會令到市民咧就好震驚㗎啦。咁不過我見到你哋過去EBT都係正數，你先收啫，即係我睇你哋條formula。噉我想明確一下，你哋係咪？

333
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:43,040
今年既然E B D A都負數啦，係咪都應該係冇收管理費咧？呢個我一個問題。另外一個問題，我想問埋啦，就係頭先我都聽到阿總裁咧就講誒，你哋都盡緊一啲力量啦，提供啲有因畀你啲員工去誒注誒接種疫苗嘅咁呢個好事嚟嘅。噉啊，我聽到你頭先講咧就。

334
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,490
唔知。

335
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,350
啊！

336
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,450
好嘅。

337
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,690
嗯。

338
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,670
多謝，主席。

339
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,750
好，行政總裁，唔該你。

340
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:02,320
Right now, to ensure that we're safe, and we are considering you know future efforts.

341
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:56,810
Taking steps that are over and above what's required of us, and testing all of our casts.

342
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:39,860
be an example for how to work with the community to fight this together.

343
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:05,880
With respect to the no-paid leave arrangements, I want to make it very clear: if someone is working at Hong Kong Disneyland, they are getting paid.

344
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:29,020
With respect to the management fee, management fee, I can confirm to you that no management fees were paid as a result of the agreement.

345
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:16,620
With the number of cast members right now, we on those days where they are only working four days, that's when the unpaid leave arrangement comes into effect.

346
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:13,210
While we aren't going as far as mandating vaccinations for everyone, we are trying to think of new ways to incentivise our cast base to do so.

347
00:47:43,040 --> 00:48:03,050
話你都會畀啲誒，即係誒有新嘅一啲time off嘅時間，畀翻啲員工去做翻接種疫苗，可能畀佢接種完之後有啲休息啊。咁咁呢個當然都係好事啦。咁但係我又想問下啦，誒除此之外，你哋可唔可以交代一下蘇花即係咁耐啦？誒，你哋嘅全職監

348
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:23,060
埋兼職嘅員工，但係佢有幾多百分比嘅員工已經接種咗疫苗？又或者調翻轉，你會唔會講畀我哋聽？誒喺未來一段時間，你哋都會陸陸續續一段時間去講下畀大家聽，你哋嘅員工已經有幾多個百分比去接種咗疫苗咧？因為嗱，我自己覺得迪士尼樂園咧喺香港咧都係一個指標性嘅嘢。

349
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:43,070
嚟嘅噉，如果你哋作為呢個喺香港一個即係咁大嘅企業啦，我咁形容啦。如果你哋都能夠帶頭話嚇畀大家聽，即係你哋都鼓勵，亦都成功鼓勵到你哋嘅員工去接種到疫苗咧，我覺得喺個社會上有正面嘅作用，因為我而家覺得咧打疫苗、接種疫苗其實而家對我哋社會嚟講都係非常重要嘅。

350
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:49,660
And for the vaccinations, you know, similar to my question or the answer discussed earlier, the vaccinations I think are incredibly important, not just to keep our Hong Kongers safe, but also to encourage cross-border travel with all of our tourist markets. We are.

351
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:33,630
With respect to how many of our cast have been vaccinated at this point, we do not have this figure. But you are correct. We have a very large cast base representative of of Hong Kong, and and I believe that you we we could.

352
00:50:45,280 --> 00:51:05,290
係一位誒鄭崇泰議員，唔該誒，係唔該，主席。我諗誒，即係喺今年同舊年啦，嗰個嘅即係疫情啦，誒又或者係一九年嘅社會事件啦，再加埋其實之前其實一直以嚟嘅迪士尼樂園喺即係過去啲五至六年嗰個誒，其實都嚴格嚟講都已經係虧損嘅情況。

353
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,150
同其他主題樂園一樣，嗰個嘅困難。

354
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:54,920
呢個噉嘅環境嘅話，誒呢一個抗疫計劃其實係而家面對嗰個嘅進度啦，或者嘅就係話誒係咪如期喺二零二三年嘅時間完成？其實有冇一啲嘅即係最新嘅情況？

355
00:51:45,310 --> 00:52:00,020
個迪士尼樂園係經營上困難嘅話，係令到大家都輸。即係我諗冇一個，尤其香港市民，又或者我哋即係議會角度，都冇希冇冇都唔希望嘅，就係話迪士尼樂園係最終係會面對住。

356
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:47,180
As it relates to the cost that you mentioned, I think specifically right now that project is is on budget and we don't have plans to come back to Ledgeco for additional funding for the expansion.

357
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:31,900
of our next themed area, the frozen, the Arendelle project. That project is underway, but it is too early to talk about when we'll be opening it up yet. But we will get back to you soon.

358
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:52,910
啲政府當我有冇瞭解過啊？就係話佢嗰個擴現計劃會唔會有任何嘅變動嚇？我諗呢個係最大嘅問題嘅。個時間均係簡好啊，回回回覆咗呢個先啊，唔該，主席。朱正，我不如畀阿總裁講一講嗰個擴現計劃，然後一張再補充。好，C. E. O. Michael。

359
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:25,300
嚟㗎啦，噉我覺得即係唔能夠嘅就係話係去歸因於係有社會嘅事件，或者係即係嗰個疫情嘅本身。響嗰個嘅即係主題樂園區面對住嗰個經營困難嘅話，我諗誒即係新誒總裁，即係sorry，C.O.佢響誒上任嘅時候都好清楚誒，但係。

360
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:45,310
面對住響即係今年啦，叫住呢兩年啦，係迪士嚟香港喺香港十五年啦。噉我反而想知嘅就係話誒，響尤其呢兩年咁困難嘅情況咧，誒，我哋過去都不斷關心嘅就係話政府啦，同埋樂園啦，而至香港嘅成個社會啦，會唔會面對住嘅就係？

361
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:23,440
咁誒，第一個想清楚去清即係知道嘅就係誒，喺呢兩年咧，尤其係今年呢一個虧損嘅情況咧，會唔會係直接影響到樂園嗰個擴建嘅計劃嘅？因為本身咧其實係即係我哋喺一七一八年嘅時間，因為其實政府係有一定嘅投入啦嚇，我唔記得咗實際數五十幾億咁上下。

362
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:43,450
即係根據翻個比例去分攤誒，當時都係即係有強調嘅，就係就係話政府喺就住呢個擴建計劃係即係唔會再注資㗎啦。我唔我唔知道自己記唔記得清晰啊。咁但係嗰個誒計劃應該係預期響誒二零二三年嘅時間，嗰就係叫做完成嘅。咁但係明顯喺誒二零二零年同埋二零二一年。

363
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:15,250
誒，亦都同時嘅係政府有冇瞭解過？就係話喺呢段期間噉樣嘅環境嘅話，誒，佢嗰個嘅擴建嘅成本啦，或者等等，有冇一啲即係其額外嘅嘅嘅嘅需求或者增加？因為事實上嘅就係即係我估大部分商業嘅公司咧，喺呢兩年嘅話亦都會即係。

364
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,150
啊！

365
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,290
第一個問題就係。

366
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:04,590
誒，閣長呢？想補倉係咪？

367
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,770
誒，如果係維持唔到嘅話，

368
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,620
總裁嗰個答案同我嘅理解一致，所以我冇嘢補充嘅。

369
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:09,810
係咪？O.K. 啊，係一位啊，姚思榮議員。誒，多謝主席。

370
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:42,480
誒迪士尼方面係應該有一啲嘅節流嘅一啲嘅方案。

371
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:16,190
迪士尼喺誒上一個財政年度明顯受到好大嘅挑戰啦，虧損咗廿七億。

372
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:36,910
誒未來嗰個開源係困難嘅嚇，誒但係截流咧，我係同意喺補救業嘅前提之下咧。

373
00:56:53,720 --> 00:57:03,030
我想問第一個問題就係話，如果最惡劣情況之下，迪士尼而家嘅流動資金可以維持幾耐？

374
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:05,850
包括頭先講專利費問題嗱，如果叫迪士尼香港迪士尼向總部誒要求取消專利費，一定唔夠膽㗎啦。

375
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:26,760
誒落去咧，我哋睇翻誒嗰個旅遊嘅發展咧，我哋都唔樂觀嘅嚇，即係呢個財政年度過咗差唔多一半啦，又走多啦已經。

376
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:55,650
誒，我想問就係話迪士尼未來如果即係情況未有改善，喺保濟保就嘅前提之下咧，你有冇其他嘅截流嘅方案咧？

377
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:53,160
但係，如果海外、內地未通關，嗰個入場人數都係依靠本地市場咧，我覺得迪士尼都能都係起碼少咗一半嘅收入。

378
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:40,070
誒迪士尼面臨嗰個誒經營嘅困難係可期嘅，啊誒資金流，我覺得都係一個挑戰啊。可能你而家呢個年度仲可以維持得到。

379
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:25,800
將來嘅流動資金係由政府同迪士尼總部去共同承擔，還是會喐？即係頭先講緊一百零九億嘅嗰個投資，誒嗰個投資會唔會喐到嗰筆錢？如果要喐嘅話，有冇機制可以喐得呢筆錢咧？噉樣？

380
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:35,260
嘅有一個決定咧，就係既然嗰個環境都未完全回復嘅話，會唔會係一啲即係硬件咧、基建工程上相對冇咁緊張，係拖慢咗佢咁？但係即係亦都會令到喺嗰個嘅即係工作嘅建築期長咗，噉啊成本會上升咧。咁即係我唔知。

381
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:16,840
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it relates to the expansion schedule, you know certainly a lot of the progress so far on the originally planned schedule, including Moana, Homecoming celebration, Ant Man and the Wasp, and of course the Castle of Magical Dreams, have all all been completed and open and guests.

382
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:36,850
Are enjoying them. Also, as part of the Castle of Magical Dreams program, was the Follow Your Dreams daytime show, which we are planning to launch on on June thirty th, which will be a great show. In addition to that, Castle of Magical Dreams includes in it a nighttime.

383
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:56,860
With that, we are looking forward to opening that up once we're able to extend the park hours when when attendance increases a little bit more. There's there's no question that the industry or the pandemic has has impacted the construction.

384
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:16,870
industry significantly not just in terms of you know you know potential delays with many in the construction but also in the delivery of goods and resources that need to be imported into Hong Kong and we're not immune to that the as it relates to the open

385
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,780
主席，

386
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,080
However.

387
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,570
啊，郭主席。

388
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,690
opening up.

389
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,170
O.K.行政總裁唔該。

390
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,760
誒，主席，我先請啊，行政總裁回答，將我一陣做做補充。

391
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:58,720
從 shareholders， as it relates to to royalties， as as we mentioned earlier。

392
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:07,480
那協議是基於使用表現和使用知識產權，和那係真係一個討論對股東。

393
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:30,420
就 relates to our cost management approach for 2021. We've continued to to stretch ourselves even further.

394
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:40,270
呢個大家都不爭嘅事實，但係亦都唔可以話因為呢一個噉嘅擔憂，而我哋又即係誒變得係即係極其負面同埋即係誒。

395
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:18,250
政府喺要求迪士尼喺目前噉嘅困難情況之下，會唔會要求迪士尼總部就暫時唔收香港嘅專利費咧？噉樣兩個問題。

396
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:44,500
As it relates to the future, there remains a lot of uncertainty as to when the pandemic will end and when tourism will will fully rebound.

397
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:19,910
And you know, based on those plans, right now we don't have any plans to come back and seek additional funding from the shareholders over and above what's already been provided.

398
00:58:44,780 --> 00:59:04,790
And we're aware of this ambiguity in our plans moving forward. But that being said, we don't have a crystal ball of what the future you know holds for us. But our plans right now are are very dependent clearly on staying open. One, but two, the the borders.

399
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:52,370
You know, this is something that, because of the nature of the fixed costs of the business, something that cost containment won't solve alone. We definitely do need to make sure that we stay open and the borders remain open. But no, we do not have plans to ask for additional.

400
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:30,220
之前我喺度補充少少，誒，局長唔該，嚇誒，同意啊，姚思玲議員所講嘅。如果即係話疫情繼續落去，或者係無法即係通關，誒，遊客唔嚟，唔能夠嚟到香港，咁當然即係冇任何嘅設施，好似即係迪士尼樂園噉樣以遊客為主嘅，係能夠即係長遠生存。

401
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:07,060
誒透過政府撥款去資助，即係迪士尼樂園嘅。咁呢啲第一點。

402
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:21,600
縱使係而家咁情況嘅話咧，佢哋樂園裏邊好多員工，其實佢哋都好似係冇冇裁佢哋員噉樣嘅，都係繼續有出糧畀佢哋，咁所以誒。

403
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:52,350
更加多嘅人啦可以使用樂園，即係畀到誒市民又好誒誒誒能夠嚟香港人都好啦，有最大嘅誒誒樂趣啦，噉嘅。

404
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:22,220
誒，亦都即係答阿姚思榮議員嗰個問題咧，就係政府原先咧喺誒第一期擴建嘅誒工程裏面咧，所喺立法會攞嗰五十幾億嘅費用嚟講，係專責係作為即係投資將來嘅設施，噉係唔會。

405
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:18,290
好理想嘅，噉啊，其實即係迪士尼，如果其實有咁多空位嘅話咧，特區政府冇諗過，喂，即係如果攞啲錢，不如還都係啦，攞啲錢出去幫佢買啲飛，鼓勵啲人打針，打一針嘅話咧，即係可能即係唔好話人人有啊，即係會有啲抽獎嘅形式，即係又鼓勵多啲人打針，又可以支援下樂園咧，唔該。

406
01:00:41,140 --> 01:01:01,150
對對，目前係失望，因為喺呢段時間裏面，我哋睇到第一，本地嘅遊客有所增加嘅；第二，透過即係誒開源節流咧，同埋誒備用嘅資金咧，佢係繼續可以即係營運嘅。咁所以無論係公司又好或者政府又好咧，暫時冇需要，即係覺得冇需要係再係。

407
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:42,510
即係亦都唔可以咧，即係除除除非得到立法會嘅同意，係唔可以轉為即係其他作用，包括係即係資助佢營運嘅。誒，至於專利權管理費頭先答過啦，個政府立場都係即係一字。咁所以我諗而家嚟講咧，就係誒樂園係致力於即係話點樣喺現有嘅困難同埋限制之下咧，做好佢本分，亦都係吸引即係。

408
01:01:53,230 --> 01:02:13,240
好，我再提醒大家一次咧，即係連問連答埋四分鐘嘅，因為我哋已經過咗好多時間嘅啦。而家下一位係姚家輝議員閣。哦，好唔該，主席。咁呢啲又走嚟走去介咗個委員會，所以可能有啲問題，可能其實之前有同事問過啊。就啊嗱，對住嗯對住今次迪士尼即係。

409
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:33,250
嗰個誒財政報告話咧，即係虧損咗接近誒二十七億嘅話咧，即係誒。當然，其實好多香港市民其實都擔心嘅。事實上，但係誒，我想講，我我我相信其實迪士尼誒公司喺香港嘅公司，起碼話佢啲同事，我相信其實佢過去呢段時間應該其實都好努力嘅。因為我自己即係我自己本身，我第一我我身保我自己都有迪士尼嘅。

410
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:53,260
嘅嘅年票嘅，其實我早早排我見到我去迪士尼嘅，嗯，即係我開翻嘅時候，我見到去迪士尼嘅話咧，我見到其實都有啲新嘅景點咧。其實佢都係冇冇停冇停頓到，其實佢都有繼續開。咁而即係當佢開翻嗰個場地嘅話咧，嗰啲同事啊都係同以前一樣嘅，即係都係一樣係即係熱情地去招呼。

411
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:13,270
一啲誒嚟嘅朋友嘅噉，當然喺而家呢一刻嘅話咧，即係我哋去到話同以前去迪士尼咁誒個個情況都係唔同啦。以前可能遊客好多或者入場人數好多，而家其實就輕鬆好多啦。入去裏邊嗰個感覺就輕鬆啲啦。噉樣噉，但係當然如果人少啲嘅裏邊，我哋輕鬆啲嘅噉嘅生意其實又少啲咁嗱誒。對於一個誒。

412
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:33,280
樂園嘅話咧，我相信係一個誒國際性嘅樂園嘅話咧，其實遊客對佢哋嘅生意其實係好重要嘅。而家佢暫時只係依靠住本地嘅市場嘅話咧，即係誒嗰個嗯啊誒蝕錢有蝕錢嘅情況話咧，就係其實我相信係誒誒一定唔係淨係香港獨有嘅。佢就算喺其他誒其他國家咧。

413
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:53,290
即係擁有迪士尼樂園嘅話咧，或者其他嘅大型樂園嘅話咧，都一樣係面對住今次即係疫情嗰個衝擊嘅話咧，其實大家都好睏難。所以咧，即係誒誒，你問我話咧，我哋當然即係迪士尼香港即係陪伴咗我哋咁耐嘅話，我哋希望即係我哋可以繼續支持佢哋啦。當個疫情嘅話即係恢復翻嘅時候咧，即係又可以幫我哋帶嚟收益啦。

414
01:03:53,320 --> 01:04:13,330
咁但係事實上咧，即係今次即係而家蝕緊，即係成廿七億嘅話咧，即係我哋誒其他啲同事有憂慮嘅話咧，我覺得都合理嘅。咁頭先局長都講咗，即係暫時可能即係喺個資金上面頂得住嘅。噉啊，希望啊誒佢啲同事繼續努力啦。我哋上一次都啊迪士尼啲同事亦都有過嚟同我哋自由黨傾過，佢哋都有交代過咧，講話即係。

415
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:41,890
即係我相信對於香港個就業啊，或者香港啲同事話咧，都都誒，即係幫到你一定手嘅，都明白嘅。咁所以，但係爭冇兩頭利，即係你要保住啲員工生意又冇話咁固然，其實都會蝕錢，係咪嗱？所以即係諗下諗多啲方法啦。通關嘅話咧，我諗其實年尾通關之前通到關嘅話咧，即係我都如果通到關。

416
01:04:41,890 --> 01:05:01,900
我都拍手掌啦，但係即係你見到啱啱早兩日先講話喂咩廣州市有單咩嘢啊嘛，突然成個廣東省又話咩回港，而又即刻停啦。如果你係噉樣喐啲啊，又搞到啲噉嘅問題嘅話咧，都唔知幾時通過關。即係我都即係呢個希望，即係特區政府都即係留心啦。即係喺個喺個情況嗱。最後咧，我想問一問啦，即係而家其實打針嘅情況其實就即係唔係？

417
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,370
就呢個問題。

418
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,270
好，誒。

419
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,790
誒，C.E.O.有冇補充？

420
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:14,530
簽署一個認購權嘅契約嘅，關於第二期用地。

421
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:45,170
即係正面嘅回答，噉我相信呢一個係一個我哋可以繼續合作嘅機會，唔該。誒，請問組？

422
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:12,720
因為咧，呢個土地其實真係即係非常珍貴啊，而嗰個即係非常好嘅土地。

423
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,510
咁咪誒喺呢個土地嘅發展咧，就似乎就同迪士尼嘅。

424
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:46,160
認購權㗎，噉啊簡單講啦，就呢個第二期嘅發展啊，原來預嘅土地啦，就政府咧就可以攞嚟做其他用途㗎啦。

425
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:59,000
誒第一最重要嘅係保護每一個市民自己嘅健康，因為冇嘢係保好得過，即係能夠避免去感染啊。咁所以呢個第一個，第二個咧嚟講，你見到咧就係誒政府亦都喺誒喺我哋嗰個防疫嘅政策裏面咧，如果係。

426
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:40,560
呢個CEO定係國長打針嘅問題，可能國長答喎。主席誒，多謝阿邵家輝議員誒嗰個意見啦，同埋誒佢繼續幫襯都有用嘅。唔會嘅。咁誒，但係誒最就住佢最後嗰個問題嚟講咧，就係誒主席，你都知道就係成個政府嘅立場都係我哋一直都鼓勵啲人接種疫苗，接種疫苗。

427
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:19,290
處所裡面嘅，無論員工又好或者參與人，如果能夠接種疫苗咧，我哋都有一個即係較為彈性嘅處理嘅，因為呢個亦都合乎即係誒醫護當局嗰個建議。咁所以咧喺呢個時間嚟講咧，亦都歡迎即係坊間有任何嘅建議，或者尤其是商界咧能夠幫手去鼓勵市民噉，透過一啲即係。

428
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:39,300
誒、誘因啊等等，咁所以誒不同嘅業界啦。頭先有代表商會嘅議員咧提提到呢方面，亦都邵家輝議員亦都代表一個好大嘅界別。如果有任何合作嘅發嘅嘅建議嘅時候，我哋樂於去做。我近期去好多嘅商會，亦都係同樣噉樣，即係鼓勵大家去做。咁誒頭先啊，總裁都就住呢個問題誒有一個。

429
01:06:50,860 --> 01:07:10,870
主席，唔，no，thank you，it's all been covered。Okay，誒係一位啊，羅偉國，語言唔該，多謝主席。誒主席，我係想問關於迪士尼第二期發展個空置土地嘅問題。誒其實就政府喺二千年咧，就同迪士尼有。

430
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:34,820
但係就呢個誒契約咧，就有效就二十年，即係話喺舊年就已經到期㗎啦。噉啊，政府亦都喺舊年嘅九月咧，就即係宣佈咧，嗰有效期喺二零二零年九月廿四號屆滿。噉啊，即係迪士尼就應該就冇嚇，即係行使呢一個嘅。

431
01:07:46,440 --> 01:08:06,450
咁所以首先我就想，即係迪士尼方面都係即係確認嚇，即係佢日後嘅發展咧都係講緊係而家個園區嗰度嘅發展就一定就唔會再考慮呢個所謂第二期嘅誒土地㗎啦。咁誒另一個問題咧，自然就問翻政府，因。

432
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:40,090
都有一個所謂限制性嘅契約嘅，就我相相信可能個原先嘅考慮就係話呢個發展咧就唔會話即係影響到迪士尼佢哋本身嗰個即係運作啊，即係等等噉啊理理由啦。咁但係無論點，市民梗係希望土地咧就係能夠係有效同埋最適當咁利用。

433
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:20,140
遵從原有嘅誒程序咧，去去，如果有需要嘅時候改變用途等等。唔該，主席。

434
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:38,720
我哋嘅疫情仍然都係誒睇嚟嚇，都係反反覆覆啦。噉就今年未必會有即係好大嘅。

435
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:11,690
誒二零二零年咧就唔收管理費，但係就繼續收專利權費。噉我就想知道咧，其實誒管理費咧應該就係分兩部分，一部分咧就係基本管理費。

436
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:11,570
係各方面都係受疫情影響，但係我哋都係為日後疫疫情之後香港各方面嘅發展咧係籌謀，所以呢個咧我都認為咧係都應該要擺上議事日程嘅。

437
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:11,920
誒即係都會加重呢個啊，即係個負擔啦。咁而家講緊誒，二零二零年度誒專利費大概係畀幾多咧？嚇，零一年係咪都可以考？即係二零二一年係咪都可以考慮減收？

438
01:08:40,090 --> 01:09:00,100
所以我哋想問咧，就政府究竟對呢個第二期用地啦，係誒有冇即係做緊喺一啲嘅誒籌劃嘅工作？因為要發展，亦都唔係話好短時間做到嚇，都要即係有都相當長嘅時間。其實係應該係要考慮嘅。咁雖然目前都係。

439
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:34,030
主席，不如我我一拼作答得啦，因為誒，自從喺舊年九月，我哋宣佈咧第二期嘅用地咧，誒政府唔會再誒畀迪士尼誒，即係按照原先嗰個方式咧，係保留佢嗰個使用權之後咧，其實土地咧嗰個最終運用咧喺翻政府嘅手裡面嘅，咁所以頭先啊盧偉國。

440
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:54,040
源誒嗰個提問裏邊咧，就住呢個土地將來嗰個使用咧，你理解係啱嘅。咁呢個即係唔會係即係作為迪士尼第二期嘅發展嘅啦。誒，而家呢個土地咧，暫時嚟講咧，係我哋亦都得到迪士尼誒公司嘅同意咧，係做緊一個臨時誒。

441
01:09:54,040 --> 01:10:14,050
嘅用途嘅，呢個係誒喺土地用途上邊咧，係原先冇包括在內。噉就係嗰個誒檢疫中心啊。咁所以咧，呢個係即係喺未來兩三年裏面咧，我哋係會繼續用呢個地方作為呢個檢疫中心，亦都係即係合時嘅。剛剛即係誒我哋騰出呢個土地嚟講咧，係誒正好咧就係能夠可以。

442
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:34,060
興建到即係我哋嗰個檢疫中心。長遠嚟講咧，就誒第一呢個土地嗰個土地規劃咧，原先嘅時候咧係指明係作一啲誒同旅遊相關嘅活嘅嘅用途，或者同埋一啲指明嘅咁咁誒。但係當呢個地方唔會作為即係誒。

443
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:54,150
迪士尼樂園擴展之後咧，其實咧誒嗰個土地運用啊，翻翻去政府同埋即係誒誒規劃當局嘅誒。暫時嚟講咧，就喺誒商經局。如果從旅遊角度咧，我哋暫時睇唔到有一個好迫切嘅需要，會有一個好大型嘅旅遊嘅需要。如果係嘅，噉我哋。

444
01:10:54,150 --> 01:11:14,160
即係同原先即係誒迪士尼嗰個擴展都有關係啦。咁所以暫時嚟講咧，係從旅遊咧未必有呢個需要。噉我哋會將呢個地方係交翻畀翻即係規劃當局去睇下有冇即係誒其他嘅用途。如果係需要有其他用途，超越即係現時嗰個限制限制性契約或者係嗰土地運用嘅時候咧，我哋都會。

445
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:40,880
O.K.啊，下一位係郭佩換凡議員啊，四分鐘。誒，多謝主席啊。其實咧，就誒，我哋知道即係呢段時間咧，誒迪士尼樂園咧大部分時間都停開啦，差唔多六成時間都停開噉，所以咧虧損咧意料中事。不過咧，其實咧呢個虧損咧都唔係淨係疫情期間嘅事啊，之前亦都係。

446
01:11:40,880 --> 01:12:00,890
係啊，年年虧損噉，所以咧，其實我一路都對迪士尼樂園嗰個經營咧係真係有啲擔心嘅。咁希望即係嚟緊都會有誒多啲嘅新嘅attractions啦，即係落成啦，可以增加即係園區嗰個吸引力啦。咁噉，但係我就想問一問咧，而家嗰個情況安排嗱，我知道就誒誒之前都有講過話今。

447
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:31,980
就係epita嘅六點五個percent，第二部分咧就可變動管理費，就係epita嘅零至八個percent噉。噉我想知道誒唔收管理費係咪誒全部呢啲管理費都唔收？呢個第一，第二咧就係誒如果誒二零二零年度誒因為疫情嘅關係唔收啦。咁二零二一年咧，因為而家我

448
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:59,010
誒即係誒改變咁會唔會今年誒其實都係一樣係唔會收呢個管理費咧。第二咧就係專利權費方邊咧，就話我想知道誒誒呢一方面會唔會誒都考以可以考慮免收或者減收咧？因為誒事實都冇乜收入啦，咁但係仍然都要畀呢個專利權費嘅話咧，咁其實。

449
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,190
係。

450
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,810
呃。

451
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:21,350
專利權費咧。

452
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,870
而家呢個迪士尼虧損嘅問題？

453
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:06,480
個經營情況其實大家都清楚㗎啦。

454
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,460
誒，我請啊，我請係總裁。係總裁。

455
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:01,620
主席，我頭先誒喺回答各位議員嘅問題嘅時候，都都解釋過啦，誒。

456
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:41,850
As mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman, the the royalty and management fee structure is agreement-based between the the shareholders.

457
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:35,380
個配份你想跟進？係啊，我就話誒，即係局長可唔可以講畀我哋聽專利權費方面會唔會都可以誒唔收或者減收？哦。

458
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:31,910
Thank you, as mentioned. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As mentioned earlier, the royalty and management fee structure is is really a question of agreement between the shareholders. The royalty. Can you talk to the mic? It's really hard to hear.

459
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:11,840
呢個員工係好嘅，誒，亦都講過咧，即係先用咗嗰個總公司支支持嘅嗰個貸款咧嚇，即係嗰個二十七億，啊，呢個都係表示總公司對香港嘅呢個迪士尼樂園嘅支持啦。

460
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:57,210
The royalty aspect of it, which is based on the use of intellectual property, is performance-based. But also the management fees, are performance-based. And during fiscal 2020, there are zero management fees paid.

461
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:17,620
As it relates to your question with this year, well, this year hasn't closed yet. However, if there is no positive EBITDA this year, management fees per the agreement would remain would remain zero. Any change to the royalty and management fee structure would really be a question for the shareholder.

462
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:56,780
剛才誒行政總裁先回答咗呢個問題。哦，OK嗱，噉啊，就我都少少時間問題，我少少問一個啦。即係總裁頭先都講過咧，即係管即係管理費誒冇收啦。最近誒嗰個亦都冇財源啦。呢兩個咧對我哋嗰個誒誒。

463
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:32,130
誒噉，但係我都擔心咧，即係話誒，我哋而家嗰個疫情咧，大家都唔知將來發展會點，要持續幾耐㗎？咁呢二十幾億嘅誒，二十一億嘅呢個貸款咧，可以頂得幾耐咧？假設咧，我哋嘅疫情未能夠改善咧，呢呢個二十七億用完之後會？

464
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:52,140
出現咗咩問題咧？係誒大家光顧啊，定係向政府誒貸款啊？呢個頭先好似誒呢個姚思榮議員都講過，但係真唔係好清楚。我想政府誒再講清楚啲。如果個二十一億啊用咗之後，個疫情仲未改善嘅話，噉我哋點樣去誒即係處理？

465
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:17,110
唔該，主席。

466
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,040
誒，第。

467
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:21,110
基金嘅目標咧，包括以下三項嘅。

468
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:27,580
第一係吸引更多年青人加入誒海運同埋空航空業。

469
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:54,780
啊，噉啊，大家如果要發言嘅話咧，就按制啊，要求唔該。

470
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:15,000
議員提問咧，就好多謝嚇嗰個誒國總同埋總裁嚇呢個咁詳細嘅解答，多謝曬。

471
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:42,990
四個議題咧，就海運同埋空運人才培訓基金嘅最新運作嘅報告，我哋請官員入場。

472
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:33,590
好，我哋歡迎觀眾出席我哋呢個會議啊！噉我哋請咧，誒，運輸同房屋局副秘書長鍾幼玲女士咧，為我哋做誒簡報。唔該。

473
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:56,790
係誒主席，多謝主席。誒主席各位委員，今日呢個項目咧，我哋係會同委員彙報海海運及空運人才培訓基金簡稱基金啦，自二零一九年在獲注資兩億元之後咧嘅最新實施情況㗎。

474
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:26,770
誒，大家要誒，我哋去估計話最差嘅情況。誒，如果一年前大家去估計疫情會差成點，我諗大家都好難估計。今日去估計疫情差成點咧，反而可能有較為好嘅掌握，因為我哋都實際上經過一年半嘅情況。誒，我哋都喺嗰個兩難之中去誒營運，呢個係。

475
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:46,780
全香港，無論係政府部門或者係商業機構，都係噉樣。咁所以我諗誒誒用翻即係迪士尼樂園同埋其他相類似嘅主題樂園嗰個營運都係啦。即係呢段時間裡面，既要保住嗰個營運，因為誒大家都好想即係節流，但係節流如果係一旦情況，

476
01:16:46,780 --> 01:17:06,790
可以容許再開翻嘅時候，你開唔翻嘅時候咧，其實就即係適得其反。可能就係你根本冇能力去應付翻即係新即係誒翻入園嗰啲嗰啲人流等等。咁所以呢個係要兩難。咁第二個難處咧，就好多議員都提及啦，就係話個營運資金。咁喺呢一方面嚟講咧，就頭先誒大家睇得到啦，就喺

477
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:26,800
我哋同誒迪士尼公司嗰個安排裏面咧，佢有一個備用嘅週轉嘅基金嚇，去到二十一億元嘅誒，收取一個誒頭先都講咗，即係嗰個誒誒比較低嘅利息嘅方式畀佢營運，而暫時嚟講咧，呢個係誒足以令佢可以即係繼續營運。

478
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:46,810
落去嘅第三個咧就係長遠嚟講啦。長遠嚟講要點做咧？誒，主席，我諗即係都要兩條腿走路。一方面咧就係誒，我哋都要爭取喺全香港嚟講能夠成為即係誒安全嘅地方。第二能夠係同一啲我哋覺得安全嘅地方係恢復通關往來。第三就係做好。

479
01:17:46,810 --> 01:18:06,820
好個接待嘅工作去準備，噉我諗呢啲係最好嘅準備。噉我覺得呢個答案就好過即係我畀一個任何一個即係誒誒最差或者最好嘅情況，因為誒在座好多人都做生意，大家都知道最差嘅情況會係點樣咁解。好啊，希望你誒即係呢個願望能夠達實現啦嚇。噉啊，冇其他嘅。

480
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:17,550
人才培訓咧，對於鞏固香港作為國際海運同埋航空中心嘅地位咧，至為重要嘅。為咗應付海運同埋航空業人力需求嘅策略目標咧，政府響二零一四年四月撥款一億港元成立海運及空運人才培訓基金。

481
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:32,880
擴大人財富，解決業內勞動力老年化嘅問題。

482
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:54,630
喺受惠人士當中咧，大概六成咧係來自海運業，剩低嘅四成咧就係來自航空界別。

483
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:15,000
今日嘅會議文件咧，內面咧已經列出各資助委員簡介嘅，可以請誒議員參閲。

484
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:08,750
除此之外咧，我哋都咧對專業培訓課程及考試費用發還計劃咧推出優化措施嘅。

485
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:59,780
而咧航空營運培訓計劃獎勵計劃咧，就係吸引更多完成航空營運文憑嘅新血加入航空業。

486
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:25,660
政府亦都繼續同相關嘅院校啦，同埋持訓者緊密合作，研究響基金之下咧，適時推出更多嘅培訓措施同埋獎勵計劃。

487
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:43,060
另外，第二就係讓業內人士嘅專業知識多元化，以滿足各工種嘅人力需求，特別係高增值服務。

488
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:25,960
咁咧，截至二零二一年三月底咧，基金嘅總支出咧約為一億二千一百萬港元，餘下金額咧大概係一億七千九百萬港元。

489
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:36,360
同埋舉辦更多嘅推廣活動，以加深咧公眾同埋青年人咧對於海運同埋航空業嘅瞭解，吸引咧更多新血入行㗎。

490
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:37,650
我哋喺基金獲注資之後咧，推出咗兩項新嘅資助計劃，包括咧就係本地船泊能力提升計劃同埋航空營運培訓獎勵計劃。

491
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:54,340
而第三咧，就係提高業內人士嘅整體能力同埋專業水平，從而提高我哋作為國際海運同埋航空中心喺全球嘅競爭力。

492
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:48,190
自基金成立以嚟咧，共有咧一萬一千八百二十多名嘅學生啦、海運同埋航空業嘅在職人士咧，受惠於基金下嘅各項項計劃嘅。

493
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:07,540
現時咧，基金設有十四項資助計劃，其中九個咧就同海運業有關，三個咧同航空業有關，其餘兩個咧計劃咧真係適用於同誒兩個業行業都適用㗎。

494
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:50,920
本地船泊能力提升計劃咧，旨在係鼓勵現職嘅本地船員考取更高嘅專業資格，為行業咧提供更多有能力操作較大型嘅船隻嘅從業員。

495
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:16,260
行政長官喺二零一八年施政報告建議推行多項措施，以支持咧發展香港嘅海運同埋空運業嘅，當中係包括海運同埋誒空運人才培訓基金注資二二億元，以維持運作同埋優化基金下嘅各項現行計劃。

496
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:29,240
包括咧係提高資助額，同埋接受咧其他行業人士喺完成同海運或者航空業相關嘅課程咧，並加入兩個業界之後咧提出申請發運費用等等，以鼓勵咧業內嘅在職人士咧繼續進修，同埋咧吸引更多新源。

497
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,990
加入兩個業界嘅。

498
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,760
誒等誒委員去參與啦。

499
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:06,630
達至咧提升業內人士咧嘅整體能力同埋專業水平嘅目標。

500
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:07,480
其實即係喺主席，即係而家我哋誒受疫情嘅影響咧，我相信海運同空運嗰個。

501
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:15,200
嗰個啲誒，即係從業員咧，其實都係面對可能開工不足，或者係都失業。

502
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:50,810
多謝主席。咁頭先誒副秘書長又講過，因應疫情嗰個有啲新嘅，即係誒。

503
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:59,820
呢方面嘅資助同埋計劃咧，咁包括嗰個即係專業培訓課程同埋考試費用嗰個範圍計劃。

504
01:23:51,970 --> 01:24:01,420
申請發還咧期間修讀嘅課程或者考試嘅費用，以減輕佢哋經濟上嘅壓力啦，並鼓勵咧持續進修。

505
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:34,520
以及咧係透過獎學金資助本地嘅大學畢業生到非本地院校咧修讀香港未有提供嘅海運碩士同埋博士專業課程。

506
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:27,100
喺呢方面咧，其實誒有關呢個培訓方面有冇考慮咧？誒，因為好多嘢可能係在誒現職。

507
01:24:50,840 --> 01:25:05,230
啊！主席各位，文誒會議文件咧就已經詳細咧列闡述基金嘅成立啦、運作、監管同埋誒復檢嘅機制，現行同埋制定中嘅各項資助計劃同埋財務情情況㗎。

508
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:22,600
以上咧就係我哋就海運及空運人才培訓基金自二零一九年注資以嚟嘅最新實施嘅情況嘅簡介。我哋咧係誒樂意去回答議員提出嘅問題㗎。多謝主席，多謝各位。

509
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:49,920
新計劃嘅目標咧，都係旨在為咗香港嘅海運業咧擴大專業人才庫，以及咧係鼓勵青年專業人士咧獲取更高嘅學歷同埋更專門嘅知識咧，去對推動咧業界嘅發展嘅。

510
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:23,430
喺新措施方面咧，我哋正在探討設立兩個新嘅培訓同埋獎學金計劃，支持海運業界咧通過在職培訓啦，培育海事法律同埋仲裁等高增值嘅海運專業人才。

511
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:42,350
好，我多謝咧鐘有玲啊嗰個副秘書長嘅簡介。而家暫時我哋有四位議員發言啊，定喺四分鐘啦。我講講嗰個秩序啦。誒，謝偉銓議員、羅偉國議員、周浩鼎議員、姚思榮議員。第一位，謝偉銓議員，唔該。

512
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:51,970
因應疫情咧，持續影響海運同埋航空業界咧，從業員啦嘅就業情況，甚至失去原有工作啦，我哋籌劃咧推出特別措施，容許咧去年因為疫情關係離開兩個行業嘅人士咧，響指定嘅期限前咧，重新加入兩個業界後咧，可以。

513
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:57,520
其實唔係好夠嘅嚇。

514
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:43,040
噉我舉個例子啦，嗱，例如咧，好似我哋有一個咧嘅誒。

515
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:35,710
亦都可以有相關嘅考試。咁如果佢哋係之後可以咧誒加入翻咧有關嘅行業咧，佢哋都係可以咧誒獲發呢個噉嘅誒發還啲三萬蚊嘅上限嘅誒資助嘅。

516
01:26:47,390 --> 01:27:03,940
誒盡收好誒，即政府其實喺呢個基金裏邊有冇一啲課程係針對呢方面嘅？我想即係利用呢個時間最好啦，係嘛？即係開工不足或者冇公開，有冇呢方面嘅計劃咧？唔該。

517
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:47,390
業績當然去提升，但係有啲可能而家真係分分鐘係失咗業。但係當然佢誒，當個疫情過去，可能佢亦都好大機會重投呢個行業啦。對呢方面，其實利用呢個時間咧誒，提升佢哋呢方面嘅技能，好或者喺呢方面可以。

518
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:24,590
係誒副秘書長誒，多謝謝議員，多謝啊主席啊。咁誒頭先啊誒，議員都提出咧，就係誒其實依家咧誒受誒疫情影響咧，咁誒誒都有唔少嘅從業員咧，可能係會有一個即係就業嘅問題啦。噉啊，咁頭先剛剛我誒都提過咧，就係喺專業培訓課。

519
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:44,600
情同埋考試費用發還計劃咧，即係我哋簡稱Protest計劃底下面咧，其實咧，我哋都係有呢個即係誒方面，可以幫助到中間咧誒，因為呢個疫情問題而係誒暫時未有工作嘅誒，即係誒就從業員啦。因為就住呢個計劃咧，其實咧就係誒佢哋係可以響佢哋。

520
01:27:44,600 --> 01:28:04,610
誒由即係由依家到出年嘅三月三十一號之前咧，如果佢哋係中間係轉業期間咧，佢哋去進修課程啦，或者佢哋去考試啦等等咧，我哋都會咧將有關嘅課程嘅費用啦，或者係考試費咧就去發還嘅。咁咧而其中咧，我哋已經將咧嗰個考試同埋或者有關嘅金額咧就上調。

521
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:24,620
到去誒三萬蚊嘅啦，本來由誒萬八蚊咧就上調去三萬蚊咁而咧，其實當中咧個三萬蚊咧就係一個即係上限啦。但係咧有關嘅從業員咧，其實佢係可以咧係修讀不同嘅即係同業界有關嘅課程嘅，就唔止一個嘅。咁所以佢哋喺可以喺呢段時間裡面咧就係不斷進修。

522
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:56,010
之前我想即係就針對，因為第文件第六段咧有十四項嗰個計劃啦。咁有冇因為個疫情方面咧，呢個課程方面作出調整，以即係更更加針對咧？頭先你講嗰個問題咧，即係尤其是航海方面嗰個航運嗰度嗰個人才向來都係其實。

523
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:18,700
係有冇補充？誒，多謝謝如其實咧就噉嘅。我哋呢個噉嘅培訓基金咧底下面其實有好多嘅唔同嘅計劃咧，都係咧誒畀誒即係吸引新血入行嘅，包括咧就係我哋有嘅幾個基金咧，就係例如咧誒啲獎勵計劃等等啦，都係咧畀啲實習生啦或者係咧係。

524
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:38,710
係一啲誒培訓生咧，就係去誒，即係提供一啲資助，佢哋咧鼓勵咧公司就係去誒請佢哋嘅。咁呢啲其實都適用於一啲咧，譬如誒中間，如果佢想去轉工種啦，或者佢係想咧去咧誒做一啲即係誒中間嘅一啲誒，即係轉變呢呢啲誒行業等等咧，去加入呢個行業嘅。

525
01:29:43,480 --> 01:30:03,490
係航空培訓誒獎勵計，誒呢個噉嘅嗱。我先講誒，我哋先講呢個船泊先啦。稍後咧，可能我可以再請咧誒，我哋誒誒財富秘書長咧，就係講關於誒航空嘅有關嘅計劃嘅。咁咧就係誒嗱，先講呢個叫誒航海訓練獎勵計劃啦。

526
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:23,500
咁呢個計劃咧，就係為咗吸引咧本地更多嘅誒年輕人咧接受航海訓練嘅。咁而呢一個嘅獎勵計劃咧，我哋係會提供咧每月係六千蚊嘅津貼啦，為期十八個月。咁咧亦都係即係呢個係為呢個遠洋嘅誒夾板嘅實習生啦。咁而誒輪機員咧實習生咧就可以提供誒最長十二個月嘅津貼。

527
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,020
即係。

528
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:21,400
特別係空運業方面咧，嗰個即係打擊係即係相當相當明顯嘅。

529
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:16,110
但係我真係比較關心嘅咧，喺疫情之中咧，就全球嘅。

530
01:34:56,470 --> 01:35:09,640
啊！八億嚇六千幾萬嘅職業訓練局喺青衣嘅紅黑角、紅海嘅教育中心嘅發展計劃嚇，咁即係呢個喺個硬件方上面咧，即係我哋都大力支持。

531
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:58,010
面受惠噉樣咯，嚇！噉我睇下誒，即係就住航空嗰邊咧睇下啊，唔知誒誒。我諗你從簡啦，因為等陣有其他嘅議員提問，呢可能都有機會解釋㗎。好好，盡盡量從簡啦嚇。

532
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:37,460
主席，香港嘅海運同埋空運業啦，就其實一路以嚟咧都由於地理上嘅因素啦，亦都由於誒經濟政治上嘅因素咧，都使到我哋咧都喺地區上咧有一個誒相對好嘅策略性嘅地位。

533
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:56,060
而誒本會咧就對於呢一方面嗰個人力嘅發展咧誒，其實係一路嚟講取態都係相當支持嘅。最好嘅例子咧就係財委會咧先至啱啱喺五月十四號咧通過咗。

534
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:43,510
咁而呢一個個津貼額咧，其實亦都係誒，即係講緊之前都係誒有有所提升啦。咁誒而咧，佢哋譬如咧，呢啲噉嘅實習生咧，佢哋考取誒個專門資格之後咧，中間佢哋可能啲時間要考試啦，考完試之後佢哋翻翻去做一個比較高級啲嘅職位都好啦。嗰段時間咧，我。

535
01:30:43,510 --> 01:31:03,520
我哋都係會繼續咧，係提供咧呢個六千蚊嘅津貼額嘅。咁誒，其實咧喺呢個譬如呢個咁底劃底下咧，就已經有咧三百一十七名嘅實習生咧，就係獲得津貼㗎啦。咁呢個其中一個啦。咁而咧，除咗之外咧，我哋就住各種嘅誒，即係誒唔同嘅公眾咧，都有其他嘅。

536
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:23,530
誒提升技能提升啊，同埋呢個噉嘅誒實習生嘅計劃啊，等等啦噉。咁呢啲其實咧都係吸引一啲啲新血咧係入行嘅。咁而透過即係譬如咧，中間如果譬如某啲嘅工種咧，佢係誒佢喺某啲工種誒從業員就係可能覺得誒個工種可能前景未必係咁誒好啦噉，噉佢想去。

537
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:43,540
轉一個新嘅工種喺啲業界裏面，去航運裏面。咁頭先剛才講嗰啲獎勵計劃啊、津貼等等咧，都係適用於佢哋嘅。變咗咧，我哋可以趁呢個機會咧，某啲工種係嘅誒嘅從業員咧，就可能誒誒個前景冇咁好啦。噉佢哋咧就可以轉向一啲工種咧，係繼續有請人嘅。其實整體而言咧。

538
01:31:43,540 --> 01:32:03,550
喺航誒航空同埋海運嘅呢個行業裏面咧，誒雖然咧就係誒過去嗰一年咧受疫情影響咧，可能咧某啲嘅工種咧就係被影響比較大，但係同時間咧其實有一啲嘅工種咧繼續都係要請緊人嘅，都係有呢個噉嘅，即係我哋發覺都係唔係好夠人嘅咁誒。

539
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:23,560
例如個去過去嗰年咁先算啦。個誒航運業咧，其實係過去一年咧，就係可能個航運誒二零二零年咧就係會跌咗啦。咁但係我哋睇到咧誒個航航運嗰個問題咧，就係去到誒二零一二零一年一月至四月咧，其實咧嗰個誒我哋講緊誒個。

540
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:43,570
個運輸額度咧，其實已經咧係誒冇不得止係冇跌啦，仲去相對於舊年咧就已經有所提升㗎啦。咁所以，我哋成個嘅誒誒呢個基金培訓基金咧，就係透過呢個不同嘅誒形式嘅計劃咧，就可以響令到咧誒不同嘅從業員咧響唔同嘅計劃裡。

541
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:18,300
啊好誒，主席或者誒，針對翻啊謝議員頭先講咧，即係話呢一段時間咧，可能有一啲從業員咧，佢不幸即係誒暫時失業喺個基金下低咧。我哋有啲咩好具體嘅措施係針對呢一個情況咧，就係誒講翻呢個基金下低咧，有三個計劃係同航空特別相關嘅，就係文件第六段嘅。

542
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:38,400
J、K、L嗰三個計劃喺呢三個計劃裏面咧，誒，我簡單嚟講咧，就係話，本來相關嘅學員咧，佢哋喺完成咗相關嘅課程之後咧，必須要係受僱於航空業，佢先至可以攞嗰個資助嚇。法華，但係我哋就係正正睇到咧，即係而家可能佢。

543
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:05,950
個問題。

544
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,500
係。

545
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:11,550
你開咪？

546
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,470
上岸啦，即係等等，即係各種嘅嘅因素。

547
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:54,920
所以我我想即係瞭解下咧，就係當然，對於今日介紹嘅各方面嘅行相關行業嘅人才培訓。

548
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:44,550
流失就好明顯啦，航空公司都要都要即係cut嗰個人手啦，係嘛？呢個就即係相當明顯嘅。所以呢方面咧，可唔可以即係提供一啲比較具體啲嘅數字咧？

549
01:35:55,310 --> 01:36:13,530
方面工作咧，我哋都係都會支持。但係實際上咧，疫情都有年幾時間啦。其實喺海運同埋空運業咧，即係本港嘅從業員啦，嗰個流失嘅狀況究竟點樣？即係政府有冇掌握啲具體啲嘅數字咧？

550
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:58,410
誒暫時會失咗業，但係其實佢有心繼續係從事呢個行業，所以咧，我哋係因為呢個疫情嗰個影響咧，我哋就決定咗咧係將呢個誒所謂求職嘅時限嚇，我哋係延長咗，甚至乎咧係會接受咧佢哋如果未能夠證明佢哋係受僱繼續受僱喺嗰個行。

551
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:18,420
業咧唔緊要，佢繼續去增值自我，佢係繼續係讀一個誒另外一個進修課程咧。我哋係暫時可以咧以呢一個嘅進修咧代替呢個就業要求。噉我哋已經係誒實行咗呢一個嘅誒措施㗎啦。多謝主席。好，係一位係羅偉國議員，唔該。誒多。

552
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:41,710
咁咪就係海運咧，可能嗰個影響就相對就細一啲。咁但係都個個經營上咧，就都係面對好多，即係因為疫情帶來嘅困難啊。譬如包括啦，就係即係由於檢疫嘅問題啊，即係啲海員啦，去到地方能唔能夠？

553
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:33,820
啊，因為一方面我哋話即係各種嘅誒基金啊，甚至無係投放新嘅資源落去喺硬件軟件方面係加強啊噉。咁但係如果個實質嗰個行業嘅狀況，即係令到啲人力流失，噉就真係讓兩者相矛盾㗎咯。特別空運業方面嗰個人才。

554
01:36:45,130 --> 01:37:05,140
誒係，別司長有冇具體嘅數字？誒多謝主席，誒多謝盧議員。咁其實咧，誒首先多謝盧議員先啦。咁誒的而且確咧，即係誒即係誒政府啦，同埋即係業界好合作啦，亦都得到誒委員嘅支持咧。就係有唔同嘅措施同埋唔同方面咧，去支援咧香港嘅行。

555
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:25,150
運同埋海運誒同埋空運咧，就係嘅發展啦。噉啊，除咗頭先陸議員講之外咧，其實誒呢個關於呢個職業訓練局咧嘅支持之外咧，其實咧我哋都想講透過唔同方面咧誒，我哋都係不斷咁推展緊呢個海運同埋空運業嘅一啲工作啦。噉樣咁而其實就住咧呢一個噉嘅誒人力個問題咧就。

556
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:45,160
就誒香呢個誒職業發展局嘅海事服務業訓練委員會咧，就其實就定期咧會出咧有關嘅人力更新報告嘅。咁咧誒，我哋嘅理解咧就係其實我哋參我哋誒，無論係我哋呢個噉嘅培訓基金啦，或者有關嘅一啲計劃裏面咧，其實都係會參考咧呢個人。

557
01:37:45,160 --> 01:38:05,170
誒呢個發展嘅報告咧，就去睇翻咧究竟個行業裏面有咩需要嘅。就住咧呢個噉嘅誒疫情影響咧，其實應該都會係咧響今年我哋瞭解咧，就係二零二零年咧會有個嘅更新嘅報告嘅。咁誒即係二零二一年就睇翻二零二零年咧，就係誒究竟個行業嘅實際嘅數字係點樣？但係依家咧我哋就係。

558
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:25,180
係誒，即係等緊嗰個報告出嘅。不過咧，就住咧舊年咧，二零二零年咧，誒呢個噉嘅職業發展局咧，都係出咗一個人力更新報告，就講緊咧疫情開初嘅時候咧，究竟嘅情況點嘅。咁疫情開初嘅時候咧，的而且確咧係有一啲嘅影響啊，對於呢個誒海運業。咁但係咧，我哋睇到咧誒嗰個報告裏邊，其實都講緊。

559
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:45,190
咧，因為誒老齡化等等嘅問題咧，其實咧呢個行業裏面咧係繼續需要有好多人手嘅。咁所以咧，就住個報告一啲即係誒唔同嘅誒工種咧，都係發覺咧嗰個流失率並非不即係佢有冇特別提到好好嚴重流失率啦。調翻轉咧就係佢都睇到咧，因為誒嗰個需求嘅問題啦，亦都。

560
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:14,930
每回買鞋。

561
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:03,430
嘅整體能力同專業水平啦，從而增強香港作為國際海運同航空中心嘅競爭力。

562
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:31,720
咁誒嗱，我哋睇到就誒嗰個有關財務開始，但係人才方面嘅誒，即係繼續。

563
01:42:52,150 --> 01:43:00,710
增加幾多人，而使到香港航運同埋空運誒呢方面咧，能夠有個維持個競爭力咧，噉樣嚇兩個問題。

564
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:15,330
誒，我哋梗係支持啦，但問題而家喺香港嘅海運同誒空運方面咧，喺客運呢個範疇咧，係相受到相當大嘅打擊嘅。

565
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:24,070
第二問題就係誒文件嘅有關嗰個財務狀況啦，咁每年都係大約有兩千零萬開支啦，噉樣，噉啊有一萬一千幾人係受惠有誒。

566
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:35,670
覺得其實我哋知道當時喺機場工作嘅員工咧係有成誒七萬幾八萬幾人嘅，咁誒變咗我哋而家咧都都係誒期待緊等緊誒機管局呢一個嗰個調查咧，就可以更加清楚掌握嗰個嘅最新情況啦。

567
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:10,450
公司咧能夠畀佢繼續留住呢啲人才，等到直至到咧嗰個行業復甦。如果唔係咧，就呢方面撥錢，嗰邊咪搏命流失人才。咁呢方面有冇做一個好好嘅平衡嘅安排咧？噉樣。

568
01:38:45,190 --> 01:39:05,200
因為老年化嘅問題等等咧，其實佢哋都係咧呢個人力報告都係建議我哋咧繼續係要吸引咧呢個新血去入行嘅。咁呢個就住咧就係嗰個誒航誒呢個航海啦航誒海運嘅呢個誒問題啦。噉啊咁或者我就請翻誒呢個啊副秘書長咧啊，就係副秘書長講翻誒空運嗰個。

569
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:40,840
而家OK，誒聽到，係唔好意思。航空方面咧，誒，老議員講得正確嘅，即係其實大家都好好清楚，亦都肯定啦。即係嗰個人才嗰個問題咧，係一個誒嚴重嘅情況啦。過去咁咁誒，就住你話嗰個數據方面咧，其實我哋咧一路都會睇住咧香港國際機場嗰個誒。

570
01:39:40,920 --> 01:40:00,930
員工嗰個嘅就業情況喺呢方面咧，就機管局咧，其實每兩年都會進行呢個香港國際機場人力資源調查。而呢一個嗰個調查咧，就唔係純粹涵蓋機管局員工，而係咧涵蓋即係整個國際機場佢誒所謂即係誒。

571
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:20,940
誒佢嗰個誒業務嘅誒，無論打直定打橫嘅一個分佈，一啲相關行業嗰個嘅人力資源情況，誒而家正正咧就係誒做緊嘅，做緊誒當下一個嘅人力資源調查。咁誒，如果我哋根據翻咧誒以往兩年前一個嘅報告。

572
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:56,720
好誒，係一位係周浩鼎議員，唔該係啊，唔該主席。因為啱啱我知道阿姚思玲議員有啲緊要事，不如我畀佢講先，佢講完之後再我好嘛？咁等佢可以完成咗先。好嘅，姚思玲議員，好，好多謝周議員嚇誒。嗱誒，第一問題就係誒嗱，呢個基金嘅目的就係提升香港行業。

573
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:35,630
誒政府到而家佢我知道咧，畀嘅支援係好有限。喺喺人才方面咧，而家我知道誒客運方面嘅海運、空運嘅嗰個誒有關嘅公司咧，經營好睏難。咁而家政府就誒撥錢繼續資助一啲未來嘅即係人才培訓啦。咁但係現有人才，

574
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:55,640
財咧好多公司咧，而家諗緊係點樣裁減嘅。咁政府有冇辦法去即係同呢啲公司傾？嗱，你唔好裁減啦，我畀一啲支援你啊，譬如一啲嘅增值嘅培訓啊，或者係呢方面可唔可以使增加誘因，使到呢啲海運、航空運嘅客運嘅？

575
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:53,720
個嘅漁船費用、漁船費用嘅補貼等等啦，咁咁呢啲咧就住喺公司誒嗰個即係誒誒資助啦。咁此外咧，其實我哋都咧有就住咧誒，例如咧去呢個噉嘅誒。

576
01:44:54,200 --> 01:45:09,670
噉我哋文件裏面都提出咧，就係有誒兩個嘅就住航誒海運嘅措施咧，就係同埋高增值嘅，尤其是高增值嘅誒誒航運嘅誒方面嘅誒誒措施推出咗嘅，即係包括咧就係誒呢個誒誒。

577
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:47,020
方面咧，誒機管局咧都已經係推出一啲嘅寬減嘅措施，畀呢啲嘅誒零售商啊等等，誒而呢一個嗰個寬減嘅措施咧，最新已經係延長到去今年嘅七月底㗎啦。我補充係咁多。

578
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:52,150
通過呢個培訓入行個個數字睇唔到嚇，即係話通過呢幾年嘅培訓，咁有幾多人入咗行咧？噉樣而誒同時間，因為呢個行業誒嗰個誒工工作啊、環境啊各方面原因咧，流失有幾多咧？咁喺中間你哋通過培訓之後，最後幫咗幾呢個行業？

579
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:21,000
係啊，姚思榮議員好關心啊，點樣留住嚇呢啲人才嘅方法嚇？邊位答啊，國長或者係誒副秘書長？係多謝多謝主席，多謝誒姚議員嘅誒問題啦。噉樣噉就住咧誒，政府對於誒有關業界嘅支援。

580
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:41,010
方面咧，首先咧，對於公司方面啦，或者係個船隻擁有者方面咧，咁其實咧，響嗰個政府嘅防疫抗疫基金底下面咧，我哋都有就住咧本地嘅商用船隻咧，提供咧一筆過一萬蚊嘅非實用補誒補貼啦，即係去年嘅時候，咁咧亦都係會誒已經向船隻誒商用船咧提供一筆。

581
01:43:54,110 --> 01:44:14,120
誒合資格嘅誒跨境渡輪啊！誒每艘合資格嘅跨境渡輪咧，船隻咧提供一筆過五十萬元嘅非實報實銷嘅補貼啦。噉樣咁呢啲都係我哋睇到咧，係對於因為業界嘅經營困難咧而提出嘅一啲嘅補貼嘅措施嚟嘅。咁至於咧誒培訓嘅人才方面咧，其實頭先。

582
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:34,130
誒，我哋都提過咧，誒，其實其中一個咧，主要我哋誒誒因應呢個疫情關係而進行嘅一個改善，就住或者係再加強嘅措施咧，就係我哋誒頭先講嘅個專業培訓課程同埋考試費用發還計劃底下面咧，就容許誒轉職嘅在職誒人員咧，即係呢兩個業界。

583
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:54,140
嘅人員咧，就係去誒修讀有關相關嘅課程啦，同埋嘅考試或費用嘅發還嘅。咁呢個都係我哋誒，即係誒就住誒呢個疫情特別而推出嘅一啲措施啦。噉樣咁至於咧，其實咧，我哋係誒不斷噉樣咧誒就住嗰個誒培訓基金裏面，即係我哋睇到業界有需要咧，就推行啲新措施嘅。

584
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:30,250
一個好啲嘅一個誒計劃咧，就係去培訓有關嘅人才啦。咁另外就係誒資助咧，誒因為香港本地咧就係比較少誒適合嘅課程啦。噉我哋亦都係計劃緊咧推出啲新嘅新嘅計劃咧，就資助咧香港嘅本地嘅人士去進進行進修嘅。咁呢啲誒噉嘅進

585
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:50,260
收啊，或者係啲培訓嘅計劃咧，其實都係講緊咧，係希望可以鼓勵咧一啲在職嘅誒，即係或者本身係響誒有關嘅業界啦，但係可以咧就係更加去提升佢哋嘅誒知識啦，咁而係推出嘅一啲措施嚟嘅。咁呢個就係關於嗰個航空業咧，我哋所誒進行嘅一啲誒計劃啦。

586
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:11,470
喺呢方面會唔會有進一步嘅誒諗法咁解？唔該啊，主席。

587
01:45:50,260 --> 01:46:10,270
啦咁噉，其實仲有現成一啲計劃咧，我哋都係講緊啲誒，譬如誒呢個海海運同埋空運嘅誒業嘅實習計劃等等咧。呢個叫M.A.I.S嘅計劃啦，都係咧誒，希望咧係鼓勵咧一啲噉嘅年青人咧，或者係即係其他譬如誒相關，即係未未必係嗯，即係完全係啊喺。

588
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:30,280
係誒，即係可能係業界裡面咧，係有關嘅人士咧，就係去進行一啲再多一啲嘅實習啦，或者係誒希望透過呢個津貼咧，就係可以咧個培訓咧誒，對於嗰個實習生嘅培訓做得更加好嘅。咁呢個就係關於咧誒，我哋呢個誒海軍方面嘅培訓啦。咁誒。

589
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:50,290
誒或者我等啊誒謝副秘書長睇下佢關於誒航空嗰邊嘅培訓嘅計劃嚇。係主席謝女士係嗱誒航空嗰方面咧，我諗我簡單補充兩點嘅誒。姚議員提及嗰啲誒員工咧，可能都係誒而家被逼誒可能會面對裁員危險，或者即係要放無薪假啦。咁喺呢方面。

590
01:46:50,290 --> 01:47:10,300
咧，其實誒機場管理局咧係特別設立咗個機場培訓津貼計劃，就係咧鼓勵一啲誒而家可能喺放緊無薪假期間嘅員工咧，係可以接受培訓。而每個合資格嗰個員工咧，佢其實喺修讀完佢嗰個培訓課程之後咧，係可以獲發誒津貼嘅。咁誒頭先姚議員都話即係。

591
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:30,310
主要就係客運方面咧，其實都係大受打打擊。呢方面我哋係明白嘅。咁誒客運咧，其實亦都係有個連帶影響啦。去到喺誒機場入面嘅一啲嘅誒零售啊、食市啊，或者誒一啲誒輔助嘅營運商等等。咁喺呢方。

592
01:47:47,300 --> 01:48:07,310
好嘅，多謝啊。下一位係周浩鼎，議員唔該，係唔該啊，主席。噉啊，我自己過去咧，一路都好關心呢個啊啊海事同埋呢一個嘅啊空運嘅相關嘅服務嗰個培訓基金啊。我自己一七年都已經係做過相關嘅立。

593
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:27,320
法會嘅質詢啦，咁今日其實立法會嘅背景資料嘅文件都列翻當日我嘅質詢嗰啲文件嘅問題出嚟。咁當然我係其實好歡迎喺一九年嘅時候，你哋已經加碼注資咗錢落去呢一個嘅基金啦，咁去支援呢個海事同埋空運嘅相關嘅人才嘅培訓。噉我自己咧就有一個誒。

594
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:47,330
意見咧就想問一問咧，就係話第一，誒我留意到咧，其實今日嘅文件咧，特別係第十一段開始咧，都係特別提到一啲海事專業人員同專家嘅培訓啦。咁其實咧，過去我哋都見到咧，就係啊，因為好多人未必好認知呢個行業，但係其實咧，呢一個嘅高增值嘅。

595
01:48:47,330 --> 01:49:07,340
航運業包括誒，我哋見到嘅，例如海事仲裁、海事保險、船舶融資啊等等嘅呢一啲噉嘅服務咧，其實喺香港咧未來咧係絕對有可為嘅。噉我哋見到嘅就係例如話，最近咧有一啲國際嘅航運組織係再落户翻嚟香港嘅，例如International Chamber of Shipping啦。

596
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:27,350
啊！呢個其實都係一個誒，即係國際嘅航運嘅組織就落户翻嚟香港，噉係好事嚟嘅。對於香港嚟講，我其實個問題咧，就想問下，隨住既然你哋而家都加埋喺呢個基金度注資啦，擺多啲錢落去培養更多人才，另一個方式會唔會你哋會加強一啲？

597
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:47,360
向全世界去爭取更多嘅相關嘅國際營商嘅航運組織啊，落户香港噉，儘量咧就做到將香港變成一個即係航運業嘅嗰個嘅產業中心啊。包括我哋頭先講嘅，無論仲裁、海事保險、誒船破融資等等一係列一站式服務擺喺香港咧，噉。

598
01:49:47,360 --> 01:50:07,370
噉樣先最有效，可以幫嗰啲培訓到嘅人員咧，將來又有嗰個就業嘅出路。噉我就想聽下，即係局方會唔會喺呢方面咧已經有啲計劃嘅鋪排？即係我覺得其實爭取到例如話international trainee travelling翻嚟香港咧，我覺得已經好好啦。咁當然仲有其他㗎嘛。噉我就想聽下局方。

599
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:32,010
好，副秘書長係誒，多謝主席，多謝阿周議員。咁咧就住頭先，阿周議員講咧都好多謝阿周議員咧咁清楚香港咧個個航運嘅發展啦。咁其實阿周議員講得冇錯嘅，噉就係咧係誒國際航運工入誒工會啦，即係International Chamber of Shipping咧，就喺二零一九年咧就喺誒本港成立咗聯。

600
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:52,020
落處嘅咁咧，其實呢個都係一個好好嘅消息咧，因為咧係工會自從自佢創立以嚟咧，係首次喺倫倫敦嘅總部以外咧設立誒辦公室嘅。咁此外咧，仲有一個誒國際組織就係波羅的海國際航運工會啦，我哋簡稱佢Bimco啦。噉啊，呢個波羅的海國際航運工會咧就喺以

601
01:53:57,270 --> 01:54:00,970
係唔該，謝謝。誒，嗱，呢呢個今日討論就係講緊誒。

602
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:56,990
工作嚟嘅，係多謝主席，多謝主席。好，係一位邵家輝議員，唔該。

603
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:26,420
啲課課程啦，我我想問你哋有冇記錄？其實呢人裏邊有幾多係入翻呢行裏邊嘅？

604
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:55,900
講咗啦，就係佢哋係誒一定要係喺個業界裏面服務嘅。例如咧，誒我舉個例子啦，咁咧就係誒。

605
01:50:52,020 --> 01:51:12,030
二零二零年九月份咧，係正式通過咧呢個《Bingo》誒法律及制裁條款二零二零啦。噉啊，咁呢個誒誒條款裡面咧，就係列為咧香港咧作為一個誒海事合約嘅標準爭議解決條款中咧四個指定嘅仲裁地之一，就係同咧倫敦啦、紐約同埋新加坡睇齊嘅。

606
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:32,040
新加坡睇齊嘅，咁可以見到咧，呢個係一個好，即係對我哋嚟講一個好好消息啦。因為香港咧作為一個，即係已經係可以作為一個誒仲裁地之一啦。咁咁而誒其實咧，我哋係誒透過咧不斷噉樣去誒接觸，即係唔同嘅啲機構啦，同埋咧亦都我哋係透過咧其他政策，例如咧係税務嘅。

607
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:52,050
政策咧就希望咧吸引咧更加多嘅誒有關誒服務高增值服務嘅海運嘅行業咧嚟香港落户㗎。咁其實誒可能啊，大家都知道咧，就係其實咧誒，我哋舊年咧就係多謝立法會啦嚇，通過咗二零二零年嘅税務修訂咧，船泊租任税務寬減條例啦，同埋誒。

608
01:51:52,050 --> 01:52:12,060
二零一九年咧，誒同埋有保險有關嘅誒業務嘅利得税寬免條例啦。咁呢兩條條例咧，其實都係咧為咗船舶嘅租任啦、海事保險等等咧，係提高税務優惠嘅。咁呢誒，我哋希望咧就係透過呢啲税務嘅誒條款咧，令到咧更吸引更加多嘅呢啲誒國際嘅誒公司咧就嚟香港。

609
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:32,070
落户㗎。咁除此之外咧，其實我哋依家咧都肯定研究緊其他嘅一啲税務嘅優惠啦。噉就希望咧可以透過咧，譬如誒，即係一啲嘅呢啲噉嘅政策咧，就可以吸引咧有關誒船舶嘅管理啊，誒或者係咧誒誒出租啊，甚至乎咧其實係佢其他嗰啲保險等等咧，就係嚟到香港。

610
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:52,080
咧係去公誒，即係落户開公司噉樣嘅。咁誒，除咗呢個政策方面咧，我哋都係咧誒，由透過即係我哋香港需要人才咧去進行關工作啦。咁噉，所以其實我哋文件咧第十三個十三段咧，其實都係特別針對呢樣嘢咧，就係例如仲裁法律等等嘅服務咧，就係提供誒一個噉嘅新嘅計劃嘅。咁呢一個。

611
01:52:52,080 --> 01:53:12,090
嘅海事服務業咧，見習計劃嘅，我哋嘅呢個主要目標咧，就係希望咧可以鼓勵啲公司咧，就係誒，即係提供一個定製嘅見習培訓，即係為咗咧一啲培訓啲更加專業嘅人才咧，就定立一個誒培訓計劃。噉我哋透過資助呢啲公司咧，就係希望可以咧佢哋係自己培訓啦，亦都吸引咧更加

612
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:32,100
多嘅，即係例如海事法律嘅專業人才咧，就參與呢個噉嘅測測加入呢個行業嘅。噉我哋希望透過呢啲揼專門亦都專業嘅培訓咧，就令到咧香港即係吸引更加多嘅人才嚟香港咧，可以誒提供呢啲服務啦。咁其實相輔相成嘅。一方面我哋吸引公司嚟香港，另一方面我哋係培訓有關嘅專業。

613
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:52,110
人才喺香港繼續提供啲服務，希望咧形成一個即係好似大家更加一個誒誒建立一個更加羣體，去令到咧成件事咧做得更加好咁啦。咁呢個係我哋整體咧透過無論政策啦，或者係誒呢個噉嘅人才培訓，去達到呢個推廣香港嘅高增值海運業嘅一個我哋嘅工。

614
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:21,260
我哋喺啊二零一四年嘅時候就撥咗一億，二零一九年嘅時候就撥咗兩億，就去培訓一啲誒海運同埋空運人才啦嚇嗰啲嘅朋友噉樣嘅。噉就文件顯示咧，去到二零二零年十月咧，噉啊大約就培訓咗有一萬零三百個人參與咗噉樣。

615
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:41,270
我我我想問問咧，即係嗱，我先表達啦，即係誒，即係對於誒啊，除咗喺大學培訓一啲即係大學嘅人才嘅話咧，其實喺專科去培訓一啲人才咧，其實對於香港都係一件好事嚟嘅。如果唔係，個個都走咗，唔係又話做學士，又話做副學士噉樣，到最屘，其實大家都唔係好專業。

616
01:54:41,270 --> 01:55:01,280
或者某啲科目嘅話咧，即係誒出嚟去揾食咧，其實都唔係一定容易嘅。反為咧，即係對於一啲行業裏邊嘅專才咧去培訓咧，我相信誒對於香港嘅發展其實係好嘅。咁所以如果適量嘅培訓咧，喺某啲範疇嘅人士咧嘅專業咧，我我相信係一件好事嚟嘅。OK，咁嗱誒，而呢一個啊項目嘅話咧，即係我，想。

617
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:21,290
相信隻海運同航運一定同阿譚志明議員有關啦，即係佢多年都成日講緊話點樣去幫業界去提升、提培訓多啲人才出嚟，即係喺喺佢哋個業界裏邊可以即係補足佢哋嘅勞動力啊，等等噉樣。咁所以我我知佢都用咗好多努力嘅。噉啊，頭先我我開頭都講咗，噉你但係而家培訓咗即係一萬零三百個啲學生，即係讀過啲。

618
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:02,390
嘅。

619
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,860
喂，主席。

620
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:51,890
咁呢個計劃咧，就係即係。

621
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:04,520
噉佢哋考試嘅時候咧，亦都有個特別嘅津貼三千蚊。

622
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:01,030
係啦，就係例如阿朱姐使唔使現場會議啊？呢個誒你。

623
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:29,170
多謝曬，係我哋聽到，我哋會誒小心去、認真去執行嘅。唔該曬。好，作為一位啊陸縱雄演員。

624
02:00:42,510 --> 02:00:49,360
噉啊，其中一樣咧，我同海員工會咧，就係長期都關注咧嗰個航海訓練獎勵計劃㗎。

625
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:59,570
譬如嗰啲遠洋船泊嘅甲板實習生咧，就可以有六千蚊嘅津貼啦，就十八個月即係kitet啦。

626
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:42,230
咁咧，我係好支持咧海運同埋空運嘅人才培訓計劃嘅，因為香港的而且確係一個海運同埋航中心，噉啊人才咧最關重要嘅。

627
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:48,650
係秘書長，係誒，多謝主席。誒，其實咧就住咧誒，我哋誒嘅即係不同嘅誒計劃咧，我哋係有，一我哋會睇翻嗰個誒透過問卷啦，透過一啲訪問啦等等咧，就去睇翻究竟咧呢啲噉嘅計劃裏面嘅成效係點樣嘅。其中一個我哋會睇嘅。

628
01:55:48,650 --> 01:56:08,660
嘅成效就係誒，佢哋其實係有冇最後咧係誒參加翻或者加入翻有關嘅業界嘅咁咧？其實誒就住其實嗱有一啲嘅誒行業咧，譬如啲獎學金咁先算咧。其實我哋係有有個要求咧，就係受惠者咧，佢哋係需要咧係去加入個行業咧係誒做十二至十八個月不等啦。

629
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:28,670
啦咁咁呢個都係咧，為咗係誒保障咧，佢哋誒有關嘅誒，即係受惠者佢哋誒攞咗政府嘅啲資助或者獎學金之後咧，係會貢獻翻畀個行業嘅。咁誒嗱，我就其實咧，我哋有一啲數字咧，就係一個比較誒籠統啲嘅數字啦。噉就係誒講緊咧某。

630
01:56:28,670 --> 01:56:48,680
啲特別嘅誒計劃底下面咧，就係誒究竟參與翻咧嗱，即係呢個呢個就唔係講緊咧，係誒嗰個誒啊，我可以或者再同大家分享一啲我哋手頭上有個數字啦。噉啊，頭先講咗就係誒誒，頭先講咗就係話我哋有啲嘅計劃咧，佢哋係需要咧係誒，即係。

631
01:56:48,680 --> 01:57:08,690
參加完之後咧，噉就係要服務個行業咧，係誒一定嘅誒誒時間啦。咁所以咧，其實咧，佢哋係誒係一定咧，係會係會係即係受惠者就一定一百percent就係會參與嗰個行業嘅。咁有啲行業咧，即係其實本身佢係業界嘅從業員嚟嘅。咁個業界嘅從業員咧，佢哋就自己咧就係一。

632
01:57:08,690 --> 01:57:28,700
定誒，即係譬如頭先講嘅專業培訓嗰個protest嗰個計劃咧，就係業界嘅噉，所以佢哋都係咧誒屬於業界人士咁變咗。因為學生同埋業界嘅比率咧大致上咧就係誒三成去到七成嘅比率啦。咁所以嗰七成業界人士本身就係業界裡面受惠嘅，只係佢哋嘅業即係技術咧嘅技能更加提升。

633
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:48,710
好，其實七七成咧就係業界啦，係咪？噉佢一定做翻個行啦。咁另外嗰三成嘅話，咁嗰啲新人嘅話，即係你你而家你講我聽，就係有大概三十個percent，啲有三千人學生咧，佢哋就係學生嚟嘅。噉啊，三十個percent嘅三千人有幾多人入咗呢行啊？誒，因為咧嗱，嗰個學生咧，佢哋參與嗰個誒，即係誒嗰個唔同嘅計劃啦。有啲計劃咧，頭先。

634
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:21,690
你仲有好多問題？唔係啊，唔係十二點四十五分啊嘛。呢個會度，誒OK，係咪延長十五分鐘要講一講先？誒好啊，噉樣夠鐘，我哋冇問題啊嘛。呢兩位，我知因為陸仲雄議員喺後邊，佢撳一陣，如果唔係佢講唔到嘢嘛。我冇問題啊嘛，你要延長先十五分鐘先，用十五分鐘啦嚇，都係盡量盡緊啦，好冇？係好。

635
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:41,700
多謝誒，唔好意思誒，我就或者好快講講啦。例如佢航海獎學金計劃啦，或者係即係誒有關嗰啲誒誒香港大學大誒大學大連海事大學合合作嘅計劃啦，或者係香港大學上海海事大學學術合作計劃啦。呢啲噉嘅咧，其實我哋嘅瞭解其實係都係誒佢哋有關嘅。

636
01:58:41,700 --> 01:59:01,710
誒誒誒參與咗嘅誒誒學生咧，其實佢都係要參與誒有關嘅行業嘅。咁譬如呢啲計劃裡面咧，頭先講嘅大誒上海香港大學上海海事大學合作合作計劃咧，就有十一名嘅學生咧，就係獲發呢個獎學金啦。咁咁呢啲學生咧，其實我哋。

637
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:21,720
瞭解佢哋，絕大部分咧都係會係參與翻咧喺個行業嘅噉啊。呢個係其中一個例子啦。咁咁有一啲咧就係，譬如咧誒，相對嚟講咧，因為我哋個目標唔係話要佢一定要即係可能資量啊細啲嗰啲咧，即係例如有個誒海外交流學生計劃資助啦。啊，我記得我知道得啊，唔該啊，B Y，噉樣我其實我聽我聽聽咗你好耐喺度讀緊㗎啦，喺。

638
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:41,730
其他議員你都冇咁讀緊㗎啦，嗱我簡單言啫，問咗你幾多percent嘅人其實入翻呢一行啫。嗱，我想講咧，我睇我表達咗我嘅意見啦，主席，即係我同意。其實對於專科咧，一啲朋友去培訓咧，其實係好事嚟嘅。對於香港，唔好講係大學生出嚟之後都未做乜，係咪？噉係好事嚟嘅。不過你哋有嚿錢畀你。

639
01:59:41,730 --> 02:00:01,740
咧，你培訓佢哋之餘嘅話咧，你都要諗下佢哋嘅出路喺邊度啦，係咪？你睇下讀咗咁多話，其實我就係想要嗰條數嘅啫，係咪？咁嗱，時間嘅問題咧，我就唔唔再逐個同你去去去去問啦。不過我想講咧，其實喺其他嘅行業咧都有呢個問題，政府撥咗啲錢落去咧，嗰啲人好多咧讀完嗰啲科之後咧就唔係做嗰行。

640
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:22,680
O.K.有好多情況都係噉樣，我喺零售都係噉樣㗎啦。O.K.或者一啲咩做啲髮型嗰啲嘢噉樣學曬之後，話就話學，其實唔知有冇學讀。總之讀完之後就唔係做嗰行啦。噉啊，其實啲資源咧，其實噉樣配合咧就未必好嘅。咁嗱，呢度我冇時間同你慢慢再再畀你讀啦。咁但係我想提醒你哋啫，好嘛？O.K.，司長都聽到㗎啦。

641
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:14,740
而家嘅就業情況係點樣？

642
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:07,890
噉啊，做完實習生考埋試之後咧。

643
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:11,420
噉佢哋暫時未升到高級船員嘅話咧？

644
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:29,020
即係冇人請嘅原因咧，我聽講咧就係誒本地船公司咧。

645
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:16,450
咁都有六千蚊嘅津貼，最多六個月嘅。我想問咧，就係。

646
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:36,530
誒，對於我哋嘅培訓出嚟嘅誒高級船員咧，有啲都都未必吸納到嘅。

647
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:24,800
誒喺裏邊當中咧，有冇啲個案或者個比例咧？有幾多係最後都係冇人請嘅？

648
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:52,800
即係或者係誒有冇咩措施咧係鼓勵即係本地嘅船公司誒請翻本地嘅船員咧？即係啲我我對明白海員咧係一個好特別嘅工種嚟嘅，即係可以全全球聘請嘅，就冇話外外勞嘅嚇，因為佢嘅船周圍走嘅。

649
02:01:53,080 --> 02:02:13,090
不過，你既然係香港註冊嘅船咧，或者船公司咧，即係政府有冇同呢啲船公司去協調，嚟到誒秉持一個企業社會責任啊？嚇，每年都有冇一個誒認投一個額啊？特別啲大嘅船公司係請翻啲本地嘅年青人，我相信而家佢哋。

650
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:35,110
多唔多係過埋喺六個月都揾唔到高級船員嘅職位嘅？好，嗰個就職嘅問題嚇，情況係點？係啊。啊，秘書長唔該。誒，多謝陸議員，多謝主席。咁咧就有關於誒即係培訓生出嚟嘅就業情況咧，其實咧就誒我哋嘅理解咧就係其實本地嘅公司咧都係。

651
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:55,120
好樂於咧係去誒請翻咧本地嘅誒即係船員嘅噉。事實上咧喺香港工作咧亦都誒即係話誒嗱，第一就係咧其實如果係參加得我哋呢一個噉嘅誒，譬如航海訓練獎勵計劃等等咧，其實佢哋應該係有一個即係我哋透過咧係獎勵嘅津貼呢樣嘢咧，就係令到咧誒。

652
02:02:55,120 --> 02:03:15,130
有關嘅實習生咧，就係有個即係更加大嘅誘因咧，就係留低做到佢哋誒有段時間啦。因為嗰個上限咧，即係頭先阿陸議員你都講咗啦，譬如夾夾品嘅實習生咧，就係嘅上限就係個長最長嘅年誒月期咧，就係十八個月啦。咁咧而咧輪機員嘅實習生咧，最長嘅維期咧就係可資助嘅。

653
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:35,140
月份咧就十二個月啦，咁咁透過呢個資助咧，就固然可以吸引佢哋係留低，因為佢哋有額外嘅資助津誒津誒津貼啦。咁同時間咧，因為既然佢哋已經有段時間留咗喺度咧，佢哋嘅即係技能啊，各樣嘢都一定有個程度啦。咁所以咧，就住呢個噉嘅計劃咧，我哋嘅理解咧就係即係提二零去到二零一年底咧。

654
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:55,150
噉就總共咧係有三百一十七名嘅實習生咧，就係響呢個計劃之下獲得津貼嘅。咁其實我哋都誒瞭解咧，就係誒大部分呢啲噉嘅誒實習生咧，其實佢哋繼續都會喺香港呢個行業度繼續工作嘅。咁誒，即係因為頭先都講咗啦，誒而嗰啲誒本地嘅船誒，即係誒嘅船公司咧，其實都係好。

655
02:03:55,150 --> 02:04:15,160
樂意咧，就係去誒去呢個噉嘅誒請佢哋。第一咧，就因為佢哋已經有一定嘅工作經驗、啲實習實習嘅時間啦。第二，其實咧誒，我哋透過呢個人力資源嘅報告都知道咧誒，我哋誒嘅本地嘅公司其實係好誒好希望咧可以請翻咧係本地嘅誒人才嘅。所以點解佢哋咧就係不斷咁？

656
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:35,170
咁希望政府咧可以透過不同嘅誒獎勵計劃啊，等等咧，就係誒加強培訓嘅，因為始終到依家咧誒，大家誒啲公司同我哋嘅反應都係話咧誒誒，始終誒因為可能誒航即係呢個噉嘅航海呢個噉嘅行業咧誒船上面等等咧都係有有一定即係嘅，因為可能辛苦啦，咁需要。

657
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:41,290
嗱。

658
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,520
餵！你等埋節奏啦～

659
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:31,050
係，多謝。O.K.就。

660
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:20,580
係咪應該係供？誒需求大於供應咧？

661
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:35,500
誒冇再有其他嘅誒議員發言啦。

662
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:17,030
咁究竟係個需求大於供應啊，定係供應大於需求？如果我聽你講，就係。

663
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:10,840
噉啊，誒，你頭先所講，即係應該係大部分都有船公司去吸納佢哋坐正啦，嚇，所謂做高級船員。

664
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:27,440
咁同時間，我哋會都有啲舉辦其他啲推廣活動啊，例如開放日啊等等咧。等誒，即係其他除咗業界之外，年青人開始對於呢個行業都有興趣嘅噉樣。

665
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:47,870
要咧係即係有一定嘅吸引力咧，先至可以吸引到啲入行嘅。咁所以喺呢個人力資源報告裏面睇到咧，就係佢哋都不斷咁建議我哋咧，係要加強呢個噉嘅培訓嘅工作啦。咁所以就係即係呢個係我哋睇到個成效啦。

666
02:04:48,150 --> 02:05:02,380
嚇，大致上就係關於航海嘅情況就係噉樣。主席啊，嗱，你誒嗱，零四年到而家咧就十八十七年啦嚇，三百幾個學員其實就數目就真係唔多嘅。

667
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:36,860
誒，如果係嘅話，會唔會點樣去再推廣多啲鼓勵年青人入行咧？其實我都同佢哋傾過偈，我同啲年青嘅社員，其實個前景真係唔差嘅喎，點解好似冇乜人知，或者冇乜人入行咧？呢個推廣工作做成點咧？

668
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:57,150
誒啊！多謝陸議員誒在嘅提問啦。噉啊，其實咧，我哋睇到咧係誒，我哋同好多唔同嘅公司啦，或者係透過誒業界嘅分享啦，都係瞭解咧。其實暫時嚟講咧，睇得出咧就係誒個需求咧係大於個即係供應嘅，即係個對於人才嘅需求啊。誒噉，其實主要嘅原因咧就係其實我哋睇到。

669
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:17,160
咧誒，其實就係就算係同樣一個課程咁先算啦。譬如誒，理工大學一啲課程啦，或者係誒，即係其他讀書嘅，即係我哋見到嘅課程咧，似乎咧加願意咧加入咧去呢個噉嘅誒，即係航海呢個行業嘅人士嘅數目咧，即係最後加嘅數目咧，就誒並唔係話想理想中咁多嘅。

670
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:37,170
咁其中嘅原因咧，第一誒，其實就誒呢個都可能係大家嘅理解咧，就係覺得誒航海嗰個工作咧，就相對嚟講，就算係即工種不同嘅工種，都係需要可能係會係離開屋企一段時間啦。咁而係誒船上面工作一段時間啦。咁呢個其中一個咧，就係誒我哋睇到咧，就係有啲人咧點解都。

671
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:57,180
會有啲誒，即係誒，未必係話要相對於其他譬如行業好好景嘅時候，佢哋寧願揀一個比較舒服啲，或者係比較一啲誒，可以唔使離開屋企咁耐嘅工作咧。咁咁呢個即係我哋都誒睇到嘅一個問題啦。咁咁所以咧，其實我哋係透過咧，除咗頭先講嘅培訓之外咧，我哋透過同業界嘅啲組織咧都。

672
02:06:57,180 --> 02:07:17,190
不斷響誒唔同嘅誒場合咧，就係推銷呢個行業嘅。例如咧，我哋會係響小學啦、中小學啦，會有演講啦，會有即係一啲誒誒講座啦，誒會亦都有做製造好多唔同嘅網上面嘅資料等等咧，就希望讓啲年青人咧對於呢個行業嘅改觀啦，亦都係更加願意去加入呢個行業嘅。

673
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:23,980
係有冇其他事項？如果

674
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:21,050
噉啊！最後個第期第五個議，第五個議題啊！

675
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:31,510
補其他事項咧，誒，我宣佈呢個會議結束嚇。多謝大家嚇，多謝。

676
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:13,150
啊！我睇到咧，你你答嘅問題都令到議員誒得到佢想問嘅嘢。啊，多謝你。嚇噉啊，我哋就誒呢個議題就完啦。唔該曬。

677
02:07:41,730 --> 02:08:01,740
嗱，其實咧，好事嚟㗎。阿別書長啊，你即係好詳細嘅解答啊，同埋咧回答咗以前啲嘅問題咧，佢哋係滿意自行咗呢個回失，所以係值得啊！即係表揚你哋，你哋嗰個似乎咧個功夫係做得幾足嘅。
