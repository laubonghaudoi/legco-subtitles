誒今日咧係好開心啦！第一次以西九文化區管理局嘅處理行政總裁身份咧嚟到同大家去彙報西九文化區嘅最新發展。首先咧，我感謝過咁多年咧就彙談小組委員會嘅成員咧，一直咧畀到西九發展咧好多好寶貴嘅意見，令到我哋嘅項目咧能夠穩步發展同埋係推。

16
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,800
First slide.

17
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
廣泛咁建立觀眾羣。

18
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,030
第二個嘅誒。

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,970
Amplus咧預計係可以喺今年嘅年底咧係正式開幕㗎啦。

20
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,680
為香港咧係打造一個充滿活力嘅世界級綜合文化藝術樞紐，同埋為訪港旅客咧提供旅遊嘅新體驗。

21
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:31,110
接住，我會交畀我哋管理局首席工程總監咧，向大家介紹西九嘅整體工程進度嘅。咁或者請大家而家睇睇我哋嘅投影片啦。

22
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:56,960
而表演嘅方法，噉我哋亦都盡量咧係提供最多嘅彈性，誒包括係退租添嘅有啲情況，嚇亦都有租金嘅一啲嘅優惠。

23
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:24,640
三個計劃咧係得到呢一個嘅嘅誒資助，最高上行係三十萬嘅。咁喺八月十號咧已經係宣佈咗呢啲獲批嘅項目，而啲項目亦都陸陸續續咧係推展緊㗎啦。

24
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:13,180
咁亦都日日日另一方面咧，我哋亦都將呢啲節目咧改為網上嘅直播咯、錄播咯，嚟到係去誒向觀眾咧係去呈現呈現嘅，嚟到幫助咧我哋嘅藝術團體咧繼續噉樣樣咧係可以演出同埋維持佢嘅生計。

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:11,430
而香港故宮文化博物館嘅工程進度咧都十分之理想，大樓嘅結構喺舊年十一月竣工啦，而預計博物館亦都可以預期咧喺明年嘅年中咧係開幕嘅。兩間博物館嘅團隊而家係全力策劃緊開館嘅展覽同埋所需嘅配套安排。

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:50,510
喺今明兩年咧，我哋將會有兩所世界級嘅博物館咧，係落成嘅。好開心咁講畀大家聽咧，M Plus咧已經喺後年嘅十二月二十四號咧，即係聖誕節前夕咧，攞到入佔用許可證，即係我哋叫入火紙。管理誒博物館嘅同事咧，而家已經係陸續噉樣搬入M Plus大樓同埋比鄰嘅修復保管中心。

27
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:31,720
雖然西九嘅工程同埋我哋一啲嘅節目營運咧係受到誒呢個嘅疫情影響，但係我哋咧已經係盡力噉樣克服種種嘅困難，減低物料供應嘅阻滯，有啲節目嘅取消同埋延期帶嚟嘅影響，我哋都係積極開拓咧更多支持本地文化藝術嘅機會，以及咧係更。

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:04:01,970
除咗持續發展文化藝術設施之外咧，管理局亦都會喺未來呢幾年全力噉樣發展區裏面嘅寫字樓、餐飲、零售嘅業務。呢啲咧都係支持管理局持續營運同埋西九長遠發展嘅最重要嘅收入來源。我哋預計咧喺今年之內咧係會推出三B區上嘅物業發展咧做公開招標嘅。

29
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:22,430
要實現西九嘅遠景咧，有賴各位議員同埋市民嘅支持。管理局咧將一如既往咁保持高透明度，定期向聯合小組委員會匯報西九最新嘅發展情況。我而家首先咧就係向各位介紹管理局喺回應二零一九新冠病毒疫情推出嘅支援措施，同埋作出嘅特別嘅安排。

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:53,850
誒，我哋今個喺由於呢個疫情關係咧，我哋都推出咗一係列嘅措施咧，嚟到係支援咧文化藝術界嘅一啲嘅誒工作嘅。誒，大家可能都聽過咧，喺誒舊年嘅時間咧年初咧，誒西九管理局嘅高級嘅行政團隊啦，就誒自願咧係減薪咧一年咧嚟到一成嘅薪。

31
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:13,860
薪酬啦，同埋加埋我哋管理局嘅董事局主席唐英年先生嘅捐捐獻咧，係誒有成立咗一個三百萬元嘅一個嘅叫做藝術疏困計劃二零二零嘅。咁喺誒舊年咧，亦都咧係收到咧有三百六十個嘅申請嚟自唔同嘅藝術範疇。最終咧，我哋喺八月份咧係公佈咗咧有十。

32
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,530
租户嘅餐飲嘅租户，咁亦都協助佢哋咧，疏解呢個經營嘅壓力。

33
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,560
Progress made on the hardware across the whole district.

34
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,750
誒地盤亦都係盡量快啲係開翻工㗎啦，咁陣間我哋工程總監都可以再交代。

35
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:15,610
咁而家我將時間咧就交畀我哋誒誒工程總監係去誒繼續去介紹我哋嗰個硬件嘅發展嘅，多謝各位。

36
00:07:50,130 --> 00:08:00,940
佢工作，我哋都支持浸會大學咧做一個誒exhibition一百嘅計劃啦，亦都有為八位嘅大學畢業生咧提供十二個月嘅呢一個嘅誒職位嘅。

37
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:44,450
誒，因為由疫情關係，好多外國嘅表演者嚟唔到香港，我哋係全部咧係去誒呈現呢一個本地嘅誒爵士音樂嘅表演者嘅嘅表演，亦都非常之受到市民嘅歡迎。

38
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:31,250
Thank you, Betty. Good afternoon, Members. So we have two items today which we're presenting. The first is basically an overview of

39
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:53,600
And the second paper, we're presenting specifically in our Zone Three area, and that covers obviously the M+ museum, the Lyric Theatre, the WKCA Tower etc., forming part of the second paper.

40
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:47,320
第二個嘅誒方面嘅資助咧，就係對於我哋租用我哋誒西九設施嘅文化藝術團體同埋係場地嘅租用者，誒由於疫情嘅關係啦，有相當多嘅項目咧、節目咧係誒取消啦，又或者係推遲啦，又或者係要重新規劃、改變佢嗰個嘅誒演藝。

41
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:33,570
我哋亦都咧喺呢段時間咧，盡量去誒呈現一啲由本地藝團咧嚟到係去表演嘅節目，包括咧喺戲曲中心十月同十一月份咧，我哋係有兩個小劇場嘅表演，一個就係《文廣探谷》，一個係《霸王別姬》嘅新編劇。咁喺十一月咧，亦都有自由爵士音樂節，即係Jazz Fest誒。

42
00:06:44,950 --> 00:07:04,960
咁喺誒呢個餐飲業務方面咧，我哋咧喺誒誒過去其實由二零一九年中咧，因為嗰個社會事件啦，到到今年舊年嘅二零二零年全年咧，餐飲業務咧都受到好大嘅打擊，所以我哋咧都先後三次咧，一共十六個月咧，畀咗一啲嘅租金嘅寬減咧，畀我哋嘅租。

43
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:30,120
誒喺創造就業方面咧，我哋自己本身西九由於係一個發展緊嘅機構咧，所以都係陸陸續續咧都係去聘請好多誒誒同誒失年青人嚟到執參與我哋嘅團隊。特別喺博物館啦、演藝啦，同埋我哋機構發展事務方面咧，都係做緊好多嘅招聘。我哋都誒支持特區政。

44
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:50,130
政府嘅防疫抗疫基金第二輪嘅誒創造就業嘅三萬個職位裏邊咧，我哋都係去攞咗五十個職位嚟到係誒去為我哋西九去招聘一啲嘅年青人，或者特別有啲大學嘅畢業生。呢啲嘅招聘咧，而家係正係進行緊面試，亦都工作差唔多完成。希望盡快呢班嘅誒畢業生咧係可以嚟到我哋西九嗰度。

45
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:21,540
咁誒喺我哋對我哋工程影響方面咧，都誒可以好坦白講咧，對誒失疫情咧，係喺特別二零二零年嘅上半年咧，對於西九嘅工程咧係帶嚟一定嘅影響嘅。特別咧就係嗰啲物料有啲係延遲嘅交付啦。噉我哋都盡力去追翻呢啲工程嘅進度。誒喺防疫。

46
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,670
goes through the site.

47
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,460
所以，just a picture on on the screen there of free space.

48
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:08,910
most of the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, plant and machinery, the generators and escalators have all been installed.

49
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:44,700
All the defect rectification work has was completed last year in April two thousand and twenty.

50
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:51,800
In 2020, the authority has continued to achieve an exemplary safety record on site for all of its projects.

51
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:43,270
On average, approximately three and a half to four thousand staff and workers have worked on the West Kowloon construction sites daily.

52
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:49,280
Moving on to the Palace Museum, the structure of the Hong Kong Palace Museum building has been substantially completed.

53
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:54,760
Moving on to some further completed projects, the art park and the free space, as shown on the screen there.

54
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:04,730
I think members will know this has been a hugely popular amenity, with the waterfront trails and the RDE as well.

55
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:34,420
And we're just completing all of the defect rectification work in both the art park and free space, and that should be completed in the next few weeks.

56
00:10:52,110 --> 00:11:03,050
As can be seen on the slide, there the accident frequency rate remained low at 0.011 reportable accidents per 100,000 man-hours from January to October.

57
00:12:49,560 --> 00:13:01,520
And we're now the CLP is now installing the transformer building transformer in the first stage and doing all the cabling and energisation which occurred in November.

58
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:36,310
So moving on to the Zeichu Centre, which I think members are familiar with. Obviously, this was our first performing arts venue dedicated to the promoting of the rich heritage of Zeichu. It opened in two thousand and nineteen.

59
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:19,560
And overall, since we started construction, we've completed over 40 million man-hours in total across the district, and that accident frequency rate for the entire construction period is at 0.13.

60
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:23,310
But in 2020, we managed to expand the park, and the remaining portions of the art park which adjoin the western and the southern sites of M+ were opened in 2020, bringing the cumulative amount of green space for the public to around 11 hectares.

61
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:34,330
On construction safety, from January to October 2020, we completed just under 8 million man-hours of work, which were undertaken as regards all of the project construction. At the end of 2019, that was about nine and a half million.

62
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:41,550
措施方面咧，誒，所有能夠做嘅一啲嘅防防止新冠病毒傳播或者係誒影響我哋工程進度嘅咧工作咧，我哋都係有做到嘅。誒，大家可能有留意到新聞咧，我哋最近咧係有一個嘅個案嘅，就喺我哋誒L2嗰個嘅誒演藝劇場嘅地盤嗰度咧，係有一個嘅個呢個。

63
00:08:41,550 --> 00:09:01,560
同其實係同翻最近大家都好留意到個新田地街嗰個嘅羣組咧係有關係嘅。誒，都係一位離譜熱席嘅一位嘅員工。噉我哋亦都即時咧係即係停工，然後咧就係停咗兩日，係盡快去做徹底嘅清潔。咁喺星期誒十六號咧已經係即係逐步噉樣復工，亦都而家陸陸續續做完呢一啲嘅測試之後咧，啲。

64
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:14,430
So just on the slide there, members will be fairly familiar with the development scheme for West Kowloon. Just going from east to west, obviously the Ze Chiu Centre, right across the west to the Hong Kong Palace Museum, with the Western Harbour Tunnel there and the Airport Railway which.

65
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,100
到西。

66
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,020
as regards the structure.

67
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,840
From Main in China overseas is also completed.

68
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,290
Every effort is being made in 2021 to catch up.

69
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,020
And that the opening is on track for mid two thousand and twenty-two.

70
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,160
and the zone two area will support the future core art and cultural facilities.

71
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,960
The bulk of the external cladding and the interior stonework inside.

72
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:05,440
Due to the pandemic, for the Polish museum, we're currently about seven weeks behind.

73
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:35,330
So outstanding, we have further MEP works, the architectural builders works, and they're all making good progress.

74
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:18,250
作為Authority， we remain confident that the construction will be completed on time at the end of 2020.

75
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:17,600
We've now been doing visual mock-ups for the building facade and the interior fit-outs, which are all nearing completion.

76
00:14:52,780 --> 00:15:02,680
You can see there on the slide that the zone two area is from the Zeichu Centre to the east to the Lyric Theatre.

77
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:34,630
所以你可見，係

78
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:22,470
In the zone two C area, and also the retail dining and entertainment, and the future hotel, office, residential developments that are also planned for this zone.

79
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:52,340
So moving to what we call the zone two area of the West Kowloon development, and particularly the huge integrated basement that we have been doing a lot of work on.

80
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:55,660
Externally, we are constructing a ramp, which I think I can probably just point to here on the screen, which is to the south of the Palace Museum, and that will integrate the Palace Museum with the park, and that is just about being completed.

81
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,490
That can be seen on the on the slide there.

82
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,820
for award in second quarter of 2021.

83
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:18,320
The detailed design work for the IB in the zone two area has been substantially completed.

84
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:29,480
also the western side of the district, and it will be this road that people will use to to go to the future palace museum.

85
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:10,750
公共 funding was granted for the design and the site investigation works of the integrated basement for the whole of zone two.

86
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:31,830
它將house the transport infrastructure and the utilities necessary for the operational readiness of the future venues and facilities.

87
00:15:52,110 --> 00:16:02,030
As a reminder, members will recall that at the LEGCO Finance Committee meeting that was held in March in 2020.

88
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:41,320
The second package is the Austin Road Pedestrian Linkage System, which connects the Z2 Centre with the basement of MTRC Station.

89
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:22,190
所以你可見，係 just a few slides that show the zone two A area， which is around the XRL， the MTRC XRL station。

90
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:49,300
The detailed design of the piling works for the central zone two B two C area has also been substantially completed, and the tender for the piling works has been issued in the fourth quarter of two thousand and twenty.

91
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:09,130
The detailed design consultancy for the integrated basement in the central area zone 2B2C was tendered also in 2020, and it's planned to be awarded fairly soon.

92
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:48,080
In zone two are three zones: two A, two B, two C, and they're located around the areas. Zone two A is located around the high-speed rail, the MTRC West Kowloon station.

93
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:34,820
And the works contract for the foundation and the excavation and lateral support for the IB in Zone 2A area commenced in May 2020, and that's the shot that we can see on the screen there. And the works are well underway at this time.

94
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:40,750
And this is the area that's above the MTRC high-speed rail, and we will knock through the temporary slab above. And this is where some of our future HOR will start to rise out of the ground.

95
00:17:42,080 --> 00:18:00,640
So moving on to the public infrastructure works, of which there's four packages. Collectively, this PIW is communal and government facilities relating to the engineering works, such as roads and bridges, drainage, sewage.

96
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:21,150
作為第一個PIW建設包，我們建了一條改道，繞過西側的發展，叫做博物館道，這條路在二零一八年完成，這條路服務藝術公園和。

97
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,510
on that link.

98
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,960
as of as of today.

99
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,370
for the works to complete.

100
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,730
But it'll be a very a very convenient link for the public.

101
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,690
Approval was given by Legco Finance again in March 2020.

102
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:19,010
Few slides there showing the new escalators and the new lifts that we have in place.

103
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,550
and obviously above there, we've also done some landscaping that coordinates with the Z2 centre.

104
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,860
And just a couple of slides to show the bridge in China. This is in the fabrication yard in China.

105
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:49,420
pleased to say that that work started in two thousand and eighteen, and it's now been fully completed.

106
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:33,460
The detailed design for the main footbridge and the tower has all been completed and approved by the relevant departments in government.

107
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:45,850
And fabrication of the steel bridge is being done offsite in mainland China, and obviously the lift tower is being constructed on site as we speak.

108
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:58,130
MTRC Kowloon Station Development with the Artist Square in West Kowloon. I think the public know about this bridge, much needed, and we're pleased that we're progressing with this very well.

109
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:44,360
So the works package three, the PIW package three, is the Artist Square Bridge, and this comprises a lift tower structure and a footbridge, which connects the

110
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:24,160
It was awarded in around May 2020, and in the contract the works are due to be completed before mid 2022. However, works are going well and remain optimistic that we can perhaps better that date.

111
00:18:49,700 --> 00:19:06,470
And we are expecting to have this open. We hope before Chinese New Year. We're literally just dealing with some of the paperwork and documentation issues with our colleagues in government departments.

112
00:20:46,130 --> 00:21:04,400
So there, there's a slide. You can see the alignment across the flyover that comes into the L1 site, which I'm just pointing out here. And the slot and the picture to the right is the already constructed lift tower superstructure.

113
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,370
fabricated.

114
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,040
Currently.

115
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,350
where the bridge is being.

116
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,370
After completion of public consultation and road gazettele.

117
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,080
and alongside the entrance of the western harbour crossing.

118
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,660
with the road network around the West area, with Museum Drive.

119
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:01,340
The authority is working with the consultants to explore the feasibility of different potential locations for the proposed landing facilities.

120
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,720
So in two thousand and eighteen, we commenced a new exit road design consultancy, so that we could improve the connectivity.

121
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:10,800
It's also expected that the to be launched water taxi service, which is being tendered by the government, will make use of these landing facilities.

122
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:20,510
作為一間服務站，連接訪客在中區、 Hung Hom 和 Kai Tak， 以西九龍文化發展。

123
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:20,160
The scheme has been agreed in principle by the relevant government departments, and our consultants now carrying out the design of this road.

124
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:31,040
Currently, the authority is working with the design consultants on the preliminary design of the landing facilities and carrying out the necessary stakeholder consultation.

125
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:32,800
So the final and the fourth package in September 2018, the government entrusted West Kowloon to build a new exit road.

126
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:36,820
And again, subject to funding approval from Legco, is targeted to commence construction in early two thousand and twenty-two, for completion in two thousand and twenty-five.

127
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:51,270
Finally, in March 2020, the government also entrusted to the authority to commence the design consultancy for the development's marine landing facilities.

128
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:51,430
which is as you can see from the slide there on the west side of the development and links in with a flyover which will go over the western harbour portal eventually and connect into the road road network in West Kowloon.

129
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,560
In conjunction with government.

130
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,480
唔該曬啊！唔該曬。

131
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,350
And the final slide on PLW for today.

132
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,780
as well as a new ground connection.

133
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:56,560
作為未來可能的連接，到西九龍文化發展在東。

134
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,690
所以，我們有個link with Kowloon Park，所以我們叫這個為Kowloon Park Bridge。

135
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,500
Between the China Ferry Terminal and the waterfront promenade of the West Kowloon development.

136
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:54,390
嘅人唔算太多咧，噉嘅時間都O K嘅，噉我就以每人大約五分鐘連問連答，咁第一位先係鄭永順議員啦。

137
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:50,390
contains proposals to provide a footbridge, which we can see on the slide there, a further footbridge that links over Canton Road.

138
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:21,680
But if there's any questions on what we've presented today, I also have my colleagues here from commercial, and engineering and construction. So if there's any more technical questions, we'd be more than happy to to respond.

139
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:30,570
叫《the China Ferry Terminal Bridge》，The two PIW proposals will enhance the accessibility of the eastern end of the development, including the Zichu Centre and the Zone Two developments.

140
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:46,670
In July of last year, we tendered out the design consultancies for these PIW packages, and it's targeted to award those consultancies early in two thousand and twenty-one.

141
00:24:48,260 --> 00:25:08,270
So, thank you, Chairman. That just concludes my presentation. We are happy to take members' questions on any of the developments that we have. Just as a reminder, the second item on the agenda today is for M Plus and Lyric, and we have another presentation for that.

142
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:45,770
西九嘅同事咁亦都即係歡迎Betty啦。雖然就話第一次即係用呢個行政總裁嘅身份嚟喺度，咁但係我相信你都熟悉，因為過去你都有一齊幫手去即係跟進西九嘅發展嘅。噉啊，而家我就請委員嘅提問。噉我諗即係誒，我哋即係。

143
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:14,950
O.K.好，誒，對主席，首先我都歡迎阿Betty咧係加入西九文化區嘅，即係相信你過去喺創新辦同埋喺康文署嘅經驗咧，都希望可以帶動到即係西九文化區啦，即係呢個都係大家非常之誒有期望嘅項目嚟嘅。噉我自己咧就有三個問題想了解嘅。嗱，第一咧，嗱，我頭先頭先誒處方咧都解釋咗。

144
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:34,960
好多中後期嘅一啲嘅工作嘅進展啦。咁但係咧，即係短期咧，究竟點樣係可以讓到我哋西九文化區係繼續可以生存都落去咧？因為而家疫情之下咧，其實咧即係好對對，相信而家經營緊，以致到咧即係文化表演藝術者咧都係一個好大嘅挑戰嚟嘅。嗱，我留意到咧就係喺藝術。

145
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,140
係。

146
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,520
有啲本地嘅團都準備定啦，啊！真係一開咧，我哋即係一一穩定落嚟，我又會開翻啊噉樣咧嚇。三名員開始。

147
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:24,830
都盡量係去減少嗰個開支，咁亦都我哋而家正如之前都報告過啦，我哋做緊一個即係長遠嗰個嘅誒財政嗰個預測。

148
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:54,280
好啊，噉我請阿Betty。好啊，多謝阿誒謝議員嘅提問啦。咁誒，其實喺嗰個嘅，首先將兩個部分咧，就係開源。每每張可以近少少個，睇睇得唔好清楚。

149
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:54,970
豬羣計劃二零二零裏邊咧，我見到你哋講嘅時候都有幾多嘅申請，有三百六十份嘅。咁但係當中咧，只係有十三個項目係誒批咗。啊，究竟即係究竟係其他係咪都會陸陸續續會再批多啲啦？呢個第一啦。第二就係究竟呢個項目可唔可以講多少少係即係支持佢哋嘅機構營運啦，定係支持從業員啦、藝術工作者啊？究竟係點樣嘅咧？

150
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:14,980
即係點樣係可以支援到即係呢啲文化藝術嘅表演工作者咧？呢個第一個問題。第二咧就係誒關於戲曲中心啦，同埋咧其實咧都係誒喺誒海邊嗰海旁嗰啲嘅餐飲嘅嗱，我自己都留意到咧，即係其實而家我上次都問過阿秘書長嘅，即係誒而家好多都餐飲喺嗰度嘅噉啊，當然咧第八。

151
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:34,990
六日咧就可能生意好啲，嚇！但係咧一到平日咧就出邊草地嗰啲餐廳咧就好靜嘅。咁咧我嘅理解咧，誒喜谷中心亦都有好幾間餐廳酒樓，亦都係同樣面對噉嘅情況嘅。我知道咧，即係你哋睇你哋文件裏邊都話，我有有有啲租金誒誒減免啦。咁嚟緊咧，即係譬如房署，我都知道佢都會仲放寬多段。

152
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:55,000
時間嘅咁嚟緊，你哋會唔會都即係仲會同佢哋支援佢哋，讓到佢哋可以誒可以生存落去咧？如果唔係咧，即係連啲餐飲又做唔到，又誒即係文化藝術表演又冇咧，其實對佢哋個影響都好大嘅。誒第三咧就係問咧，究竟嗱而家我哋大家都期盼住咧，即係其實我過去我知道咧，過去一段時間咧都有啲嘅表演做緊。

153
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:15,010
嘅即係就算喺氣局中心都有嘅，即係當疫情稍稍穩定嘅時候，但係而家又停翻啦，即係斷斷續續。但係即係我哋而家都期望緊，即係可能打到誒誒打咗呢個誒誒針之後咧，即係都可能會可以慢慢恢復嘅。即係會唔會有啲鋪排啊？即係阿阿Betty，你以前都做咁多康文署嘅經驗啦。

154
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:35,020
會唔會有啲鋪排六七月啊？早啲準備啊，即係當即係疫情而家好難開放翻啊。但係到六七月啊，如果真係穩定到落嚟，都有一係列嘅嘢去刺激下，即係嗰度附近嘅活動，讓到咧。即係而家我唔知道，因為可能咧以前都喺誒氣局中心或者其他咧，都係依啲外國嘅團體過嚟又會有啊噉樣，未必而家未必或者內地啊咁而家未必又請到啦。會唔會？

155
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:15,880
呢個會聽得到啲，好啲好啲好啲，或者係其實西九咧喺誒上，其實我上任喺度誒，即係做行政總裁嘅時候嗰幾年咧，都做咗一個好大嘅瘦身嘅動作嘅。咁所以我我嚟到嘅時候咧，我都睇到咧，其實喺嗰個誒節流嗰方面咧，誒都做得相當之盡嘅啦。好多嘅工程工作啊，都

156
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:45,120
噉樣睇到咧，其實除咗截流方面咧，我哋更加着重咧，應該要去做開源嘅工作。咁而西九本身咧，亦都真係其實佢都得天獨厚嘅，佢有好好嘅一個地點，亦都有好多嘅設施。嚟緊我哋會有M Plus嘅博物館，出年會有故宮，而且頭先都大家都講到，我哋個誒藝術公園咧係非常之。

157
00:29:45,120 --> 00:30:05,130
受歡迎，我我哋而家其實都開始咧要考慮一下點樣樣盡量利用我哋呢啲資產，有形與無形嘅資產嚟到盡量去發揮佢去做到一啲開源嘅工作。咁呢個都係我嚟緊呢幾個月，我會盡力去去睇嘅一個方面。咁與此同時咧，我哋亦都咧冇忘記我哋個初心。我哋個初心就係要幫助本地嘅。

158
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:25,140
文化藝術界嘅發展，咁呢個咧，我都會同民政事務局咧去緊密去聯繫啦。我哋自己能夠做嘅，過去呢一年咧就做咗一個即係少少嘅藝術疏困計劃。噉我哋都睇到咧，其實本地嘅藝，無論係藝團咧，或者一啲個別嘅藝術家咧，佢哋都好想喺就算疫情底下去做一啲項目。

159
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,080
好，葉志明議員。

160
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,140
誒由廣東道過嚟係比較難啲嘅。

161
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,410
我發覺真係人好多咯，啊！即係。

162
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,490
嗰度好好生意嘅，啊，因為我都最近去過咧。

163
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,490
誒唔係交通啊！啲人限聚令啊！

164
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,830
就誒冇錯嘅，禮拜禮拜咧誒。

165
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,540
咁咧就誒反問，我想提一提咧，你哋會唔會派啲人喺嗰度咧？即係。

166
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,210
咁誒，另外我想講一講咧，就係第廿六頁嗰個你哋個投影片咧，就關於個碼頭啊。

167
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:46,550
咁咧就誒南邊嗰個登岸設施咧，我哋都同相關嘅官員都開過一次會啊，同埋西九管理局嘅朋友。

168
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,410
就可以提出一啲節目啦，咁所以係有個潛，即係係有個potential係個潛質可以做到呢方面。好簡單，再答埋咧就係。

169
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:29,380
因為嗰度肯定唔係兩個兩個啊，即係即係我諗大家都小心啲處理下嗰度啦。咁當然我鼓勵啲市民去嘅，咁嗰度係一個幾誒消磨一個下午都幾好嘅。不過始終誒。

170
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:45,150
咧係令到本地嘅誒，即係我哋嘅市民啦，我哋嘅家庭咧嚟到係誒有一啲歡樂嘅。咁譬如之前我諗啊，主席誒誒管理局主席都有提過話，有啲係喺啲大下嘅外牆去畫一啲嘅誒藝術嘅即係裝置。咁呢，因為我哋都覺得係好有意義嘅節目。咁但係喺而家我哋西九嗰個財政嘅狀況咧，我哋

171
00:30:45,150 --> 00:31:05,160
唔能夠喺呢個階段咧，係推出一個好有持久性嘅一個嘅疏困嘅項目。咁所以呢個咧誒，如果係即係局方誒一陣間阿阿誒秘書長都會講嚇，即係我哋點樣能夠透過西九嘅場地與局方嘅資源能夠配合到嘅時候咧，我哋可以繼續去做嘅，因為我哋本身係有場地啦。

172
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:32,700
嗰個嘅誒餐飲方面咧，其實而家最誒經營比較困難嘅咧，係喺戲曲中心嘅一啲嘅商户，因為冇咗表演嘅節目啦。我哋其實頭先都提到咧，過去嗰大半年咧都有一啲疏困嘅安排，誒盡量咧係佢哋提出要求咧，我哋都盡量去配合。如果嚟緊呢大幾個月仲係有呢個

173
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:52,710
噉嘅狀況咧，我哋都會繼續去幫佢哋去睇一睇點樣可以喺租金方面去舒緩，但係更加緊要，正如我頭先講，就係要搞旺翻個場，即係要多啲節目喺嗰度做，無論係喺誒呢一個嘅劇院裏邊，亦或喺外邊嘅空間咧，我哋都考慮緊呢啲唔同嘅方案，令到多啲人流係大旺翻戲好中心嗰。

174
00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:12,720
藝術公園方面咧，其實整體嚟講咧，嗰個嘅生意咧都係可以嘅。尤其是星期六、星期日係誒以呢過去呢幾個禮拜咧係相當之好添。嗯，好啊。我主要我補充兩點，一一咧就即係喜福中心嗰度啦，係啦啲餐飲睇下可唔可以幫下佢，因為我知道有啲可能已經結業添㗎啦，已經，所以呢個唔係餐飲，仲有鋪頭都係噉，所以都要幫一幫佢。

175
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:32,730
另外咧，其實真係好可惜㗎喎！而家去戲曲中心咧，個木木艇係咪啊？好似冇咗係咪嗰個木艇咧？之前嗰個打卡嗰個喺中間嗰個咧，會唔會遲啲？因為嗰個都其中而家咧，因為喺一街之隔，即係譬如中港城、海港城咧，其實咧而家禮拜六日咧係都幾旺嘅，即係因為佢都做咗好多宣傳咧，去吸引啲人去海港城消費嘅，所以咧即係。

176
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:52,740
我都希望戲曲中心咧都唔好淨係擺咗喺度，畀多啲人諗辦法咧，即係都吸引翻佢去入去戲曲中心，即係做多少少宣傳咯。呢呢方面我哋一定要做嘅，議員多謝你嘅建議嚇。特別係當嗰個戲曲中心同九誒柯士甸站嗰條隧道開埋咧，我哋覺得嗰度暢通無阻之後咧，個人流一定係會好過而家嘅。而家都始終都係。

177
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,540
好啊，唔該。好，誒，周浩鼎議員。

178
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,960
誒呢一個或者我請阿誒吳吳生去答一答，關於個碼頭嗰度嚇。好啊。

179
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:44,910
誒有即係點樣講啊？有限制地使用啊！嚇噉，我想表達呢一個畀誒西九管理局聽嘅嚇。好啦，誒西九嗰邊。

180
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:35,980
咁但係咧，其實咧喺誒朝頭早一早咧，嗰度咧就最最近嗰個防波堤嗰度咧，其實擺咗好多啲咩咧，就係嗰啲誒領航啊啊，pilot嗰啲船喺嗰度嘅。

181
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:45,100
睇埋譯語言，你頭先畀嘅意見咧，我哋都從咧去參誒參考。咁其實北邊而家都有個碼頭嘅，大家都知道都有一個landing step嘅。咁咧亦都係可以利用到嘅。噉我哋多謝你嘅意見，我哋會誒係會擺嚟作為參考嘅其中一個部分。

182
00:33:46,850 --> 00:34:04,080
噉就都誒表達咗業界嗰個嘅睇法嚇，咁基本上佢哋都，如果你唔係一個開全開放式嘅嚇，即係係有限制使用嘅模式咧，誒佢哋係覺得可以接受嘅，因為嗰度始終係近住嗰個中港城嗰度航道啊，嗰度啲快速船嗰度。

183
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:33,610
咁咧就誒會有碰撞嘅危險嘅，咁所以啊誒，當然你哋都講咗就話未有一個詳細設計嘅嚇，噉就誒，但係真係誒，我想話畀你聽咧，業界係唔係幾支持喺嗰邊啊？南邊嗰度我哋都傾咗啦嚇，即係大家都覺得係可以做嘅，但係咧就。

184
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:28,970
好誒決定嘅方案嘅，上次都傾過，因為主要當時咧北邊嘅碼頭咧係因為誒依個誒展覽場館嘅嘅誒建設咧係諗住係配合，咁而家展覽場館嗰個項目咧係我哋要重新去考慮過，咁所以我哋都會再誒。

185
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:24,440
咁咧就上次開完會之後咧，我就誒有個責任咧，就要去問一問咧啲海上業界，就喺北面嗰邊咧。而家個圖就未畫出嚟啊！噉你都計劃喺嗰度想整一個碼頭仔。咁咧，如果你睇翻你第廿六張圖咧，誒廿六個圖片嗰度咧，你而家望係嗰個蜜蜂堂入口咧，就唔係太擠塞嘅啫。而家啊～

186
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:56,270
咁變咗咧就誒，佢哋係其實誒所有海上作業業界咧都唔係好同意咧喺嗰度咧係擺一個誒新嘅上落點嘅，因為咧誒嗰度試過出意外嘅。我都嗰日專登行去嗰度睇睇咧，影下相啊。噉啊，即係睇圖片，你好似覺得誒咦，可能有足夠空間啊噉。咁但係。

187
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:16,280
咧，因為如果係一個公眾可以使用嘅碼頭嘅話咧，我哋係擔心咧喺啲weekend嘅時間咧，嗰啲船喺嗰度上落啊。嗱，當然我呢個唔知道有會唔會真係發生啦。咁如果你留意喺尖沙咀或者呢個中環嘅嗰啲公眾碼頭咧，喺weekend嘅時間又是誒熱天啊，啊咁咧就好多船喺度等上船嘅。

188
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,580
係。

189
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,960
Betty。

190
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,020
藝術團體又可以繼續佢哋嘅表演嘅。

191
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:32,880
誒透過網上嘅誒表演嚟到去持續我哋嗰個嘅藝術嘅工作。咁但係有一點咧都要提一提嘅咧，就係特別係誒。當然對於觀眾嚟講咧，呢一個模式係好嘅，即係可以喺疫情嘅時候都有一啲表演藝術睇到，或者係視覺藝術嘅節目睇到。但係咧喺嗰個誒，對於嗰個。

192
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:11,250
誒多謝譯議員，咁咧上次都係同阿譯議員咧就一齊都交流過，咁咧就我哋明白嘅南邊嗰邊大家都有個共識咧，係誒可以係方便到誒當第時咧呢個誒water taxi啊，同埋係誒其他咧又預約咗嘅嘅船咧係營運，北邊嗰邊咧其實我哋係未有一個。

193
00:36:49,260 --> 00:37:09,270
係唔該啊，啊，主席誒，我其實主要咧都想問下關於目前啦，即係呢一年嗰個疫情底下啦，即係大家都知道好睏難噉，但係我亦都注意到咧，其實西九文架區咧，佢誒，亦都係有限度啊，有一啲表演係進行到嘅誒。

194
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:29,280
誒誒，我覺得都係好事嚟嘅，因為誒喺做足防疫嘅安排底下，誒有啲嘅表演可能透過網上去廣播冇觀眾噉，但係都有機會，起碼有一個運作喺裏面，同埋都有觀眾可能欣賞。噉我就見到咧，就戲曲中心啦，誒同埋西九都講過，原來即係舊年。

195
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:49,290
十月十一月咧都有唔同嘅誒劇場表演安排嘅。噉我就想第一個問題咧，我就想問下，即係會唔會喺未來呢一年咧？誒，即係我唔知嗰個形式係咪可以許可啦？都係話齋有一啲嘅表演喺嗰度進行，但係可能冇可能冇觀眾誒，但係一樣可以透過一啲網上。

196
00:37:49,290 --> 00:38:09,300
嘅轉播咧，誒咁去進行呢啲藝術嘅表演嘅活動咧。因為如果上網睇咧，即係就算其實舊年即係英國B B C Proms咧，即係如果大家有留意，每年都有呢樣嘢啊嘛。咁但係舊年因為疫情啦，咁誒其實佢哋都照搞嘅。如果你上網都睇到，基本上佢係。

197
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:29,380
將嗰個啊Alvin Hall噉啊攖曬嗰隊Orchestra嗰啲人唱噉，不過就每人有社交距離，即係遠啲啦。咁冇觀眾嘅，但係佢一樣係轉播咗、直播咗。咁其實誒呢個都可以係一種參考模式啊。等咁嗰啲觀眾睇開嘅，佢都可以欣賞呢啲藝術活動啊嘛。

198
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:49,390
咁而且咧，如果咁進行到咧，有一啲從事藝術工作者咧，佢又多翻個平台，又或者可能因為噉，亦都帶動翻佢有啲收入。噉我覺得咧就一舉兩得嘅，所以我又想睇下即係各方會唔會都考慮下呢方面嘅建議。咁呢個第一點。第二點咧，我就見到今日文件咧，其實都有解説就係創造就業嗰度。咁

199
00:38:49,390 --> 00:39:09,400
我哋見到咧，誒局方都有響應政府推出嗰個誒，應該講就係話創造臨時職位啦。咁會創造五十個有時限嘅職位嘅。噉我都我我我都認同呢個方向啦。當然，因為我哋自己都講緊，其實希望而家政府可以咧，就製造多啲臨時嘅就職位，畀我哋一啲即係可能。

200
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:29,410
外業嘅誒，或者最近失去咗工作機會嘅朋友咧，希望佢有個工作嘅安排。噉我想問下咧，呢五十個有時限嘅職位，大概用幾多款項到嘅情況，同埋你哋有冇機會會唔會考慮再有更多嘅臨時職位可以開設到出嚟咧？咁誒，我就兩個方面嘅問題啫。阿主席唔該，好。

201
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:53,870
誒，非常之多謝啊！啊，周議員嘅提問啦。咁誒，我哋其實咧喺過去呢幾個月咧都試驗咗好多咧，係利用網上嘅，無論係直播、直播都有嘅，唔一定係錄播，錄播亦都有呢個。其實係都有一定嘅觀眾咧，係會上網睇嘅。當然，我哋可以嚟緊呢段日子做宣傳，可以再做得好啲咯。咁誒。

202
00:39:53,870 --> 00:40:13,880
其實無論喺誒視覺視覺藝術，即係M plus或者係誒呢一個嘅演藝嗰邊，我哋都研究緊嚟緊呢一年或者年多嘅時間，可能新冠疫情都仲係比較反覆嘅時間，都唔能夠完全停曬我哋嘅工作咯。咁所以大家都係研究緊點樣用透過呢一個嘅誒數碼化嘅模式。

203
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,630
噉啊！我亦都有即係提問想問啦。

204
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,160
其實佢係入可以咧，你去購買一個當比皮。

205
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,810
工作職位，所以我哋希望係超過五十個嘅。噉啊，視乎即係資源方面有幾多咧，我哋就可以再開多啲位咯。

206
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:28,110
如果由呢一個噉嘅排片咧，誒，佢揾個誒鐘，揾嗰啲無人機去影嘅。

207
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:24,800
我喺嗰個情況、疫情嘅情況容許之下，係慢慢逐步開翻嘅時候，大家有啲咩舉措可以做咧，就令到誒誒唔會喺一啲表演場地裏邊係即係盡量減低有個案發生嘅。噉我哋其實個商討係冇斷過嘅。嗯嗯。

208
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:50,070
誒呢方面我哋都可以即係借呢個機會咧講放心，即係喺我哋局入邊咧，對於年青人喺文化藝術嘅就業咧，我哋非常之關注。總之承諾咧，即係喺我哋嗰個所謂global allocation，我哋民政事務局入邊嘅大荷包裏邊，即係總之我哋有錢剩誒。

209
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:49,190
打算喺翻呢一度文化藝術行業工作嘅噉，所以我哋就其實借住唔同嘅誒拜訪啊、實習嘅機會咧，同埋係大家相互嘅協助咧，其實係為一啲有呢方面興趣同埋有呢份方面嘅潛能嘅年輕人咧，係盡量提供機會同埋協助嘅。好，唔該曬。

210
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:53,460
業務方面咧，即係個business model咧，我哋都仲要再去研究一下點樣係透過網上仍然都可以畀到藝團啊或者表演者係有一定嘅收入，即係要買一個票嘅。咁而家我哋都喺度即係做緊一啲試驗，譬如話收翻一個象徵式嘅費用，能唔能夠都叫做維持到起碼嘅生計啊？呢啲噉我哋都要研。

211
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:13,470
研究㗎，咁所以我諗即係民政局嗰方面都可能有其他藝團都有同樣嘅聲音，即係都進行除咗表演之外，係咪可以揾到少少嘅收入咧？咁呢方面如果能夠做到即係誒誒誒誒誒相得益彰嘅，噉啊梗係更好啦。呢個都係我哋要研究嘅方向嚟嘅。咁而家其實嚟緊呢一年咧，又都仲有一啲嘅節目咧係。

212
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:33,480
預訂咗我哋戲曲中心啊，或者自由空間嘅場地，我哋都唔會咁快係同佢哋取消嘅，直至到佢哋自己要求話要取消或者延期，我哋先會幫佢延期。而當中咧，大部分都係本地嘅藝團係book咗呢啲，即係誒誒誒訂咗呢啲場地，有啲去到新年都仲有嘅。咁但係希望疫情會盡快去改善啦，呢啲嘅表。

213
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:56,670
主席或者我補充幾句啊。誒，其實好多就係議員關心西九誒誒嗰個誒表演啊或者個運作嘅問題。其實西九嗰度咧可以講係誒香港一個誒文化藝術文化方面嘅縮影嚟嘅。其實我哋同西九管理局咧就保持密切嘅聯繫。

214
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:16,680
譬如創造就業，噉佢配合政府啦，噉我哋雙方咧都有畀誒我哋嘅租借場地嘅人士咧一個彈性嘅安排，亦都有租金減免，咁亦都政府有抗疫基金，噉佢哋高層管理局咧亦都係有即係捐咗百分之十嘅薪酬，同埋加上阿主席嘅捐獻啦，咁關於。

215
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:36,690
於到頭先，阿周議員講到嗰度咧，其實可以畀大家啲參考。其實我哋一啲藝團咧，誒包括九大有啲非九大咧，其實咧佢哋都有網上去做嘅。其實網上咧有一個網址，或者我稍後我整畀你啦。我費事整，因為唔止呢個網址，但係呢個網址係比較上係多用嘅。

216
00:42:41,440 --> 00:43:01,450
某啲嘅團體咧，如果你去睇個show咧，係會二百幾三百蚊嘅戲票嘅。但係如果你買咗佢個權喺網上睇，要畀錢嘅，就八十蚊嘅。我嗰次買八十蚊嘅。咁然後佢就畀一個code嚟，噉你就佢畀一個視聯，通常係二十四小時內，你用嗰個code咧去睇，咁所以有收費嘅。咁另外有啲。

217
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:21,460
劇團咧，佢當然一次排演咧就係誒播咗播咗之後咧，就喺個戲院度播咁啲人咧。咁當其時戲院係未未關嘅，噉就只可以坐百分之五十。當然而家戲院都冇啦嚇，百分之五十。咁當初佢係誒book咗兩場嘅，咁結果係誒賣曬啲飛，咁結果。

218
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:48,400
咁結果係喺個戲院度影咗六場嘅同一個表演，咁所以呢一個劇團咧喺戲院營運嘅時候咧係又繼續用呢個方式嘅，咁所以其實香港嘅藝團咧亦都係誒即係有個需要激發起佢哋嘅誒創造力啦。咁康文署同誒西九亦都大家拍住做咧，就係即係。

219
00:43:48,400 --> 00:44:08,410
康文署亦都有提供一啲當然免費啦。康文署無論係誒喺家中去做一啲誒誒運動嘅項目啊，或者帶大家去誒一啲博物館去睇啊，咁都誒有做呢啲活動嘅。咁喺往後嘅將來咧，我哋其實都繼續同啲藝團係商討緊誒，如果

220
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,150
其實。

221
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,850
都係。

222
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,350
啊！等等，其實而家你見到。

223
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,400
即係咩都冇嘅喎，咁所以我想問呢方面嘅開源。

224
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,020
咁另一方面咧，就係其實頭先講到培訓人才嗰度，我都有興趣瞭解就係。

225
00:46:52,910 --> 00:47:01,350
咁誒，其實頭先都聽咗好詳細，即係無論常秘又好，或者誒即係總裁又好咧，咁都講咗即係西亞情況啦。

226
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:11,520
噉我覺得其實西九而家開始係一個收成期嚟嘅，因為之前就住工程嗰啲嘢咧都經歷咗好多困難啦。噉你見得到即係。

227
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:27,270
去即係令到西九係多啲嘅收入收益，咁所以其實之前咧嚟過呢一度，亦都介紹個即係特別加強嘅財務版啦，點樣將啲。

228
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:06,820
嗱，其實誒文化產業，我哋文化係幾好嘅，但係點樣產業化呢樣嘢咧，係即係可能個市場啦，或者個應用嘅場景係唔夠嘅香港。

229
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:56,000
第二樣嘢咧就係頭先雖然講到Amicus又好或者告公，即係嚟緊會開嘅時候收入都會多咗啊！呢個就係即係講嘅開源啊嘛。咁但係我所知就係即係其實呢一啲嘅開源可能。

230
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:41,860
兩邊經驗都有，亦都可以喺內地個咁旺盛嗰個即係文化產業嘅場景裏面，亦都學習到一啲嘢。咁誒，同埋大灣區呢個機遇咁大嘅時候咧，點樣即係西九去幫手開台？呢個睇第一樣嘢。

231
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:49,360
咁呢方面，我希望政府係可以即係加強支援，啊，即係畀佢哋，令到佢哋可以喺即係啊網上平台或者唔同嘅即係平台，誒，去即係加強佢哋嗰個，即係繼續到佢哋嗰個即係工作啦。

232
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:15,640
最初嚟講，可能都係你當翻，即係攞翻嗰個營運開支已經算係唔錯啦。咁但係個問題係西九嗰條數咧，其實都係幾大嘅。咁所以開源嗰方面咧，我自己睇咧，除咗係呢一啲嘅場地嘅收入之外咧，更重要就係點樣透過可能商業模式。

233
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:45,120
答翻周源第二個問題，關於創造就業啦。咁誒，首先感謝特區政府啦，就畀咗即係有五十個嘅誒職位。咁呢啲職位咧，其實都係分佈喺唔同我哋嘅部門嘅。有啲真係誒，真係從事博物館嘅工作嘅，即係譬如M家會喺M家嗰度工作啦，甚至未開嘅故宮文化博物館咧，佢哋都我哋都開咗一啲。

234
00:44:45,120 --> 00:45:05,130
位畀佢哋，我哋期望咧，其實唔係希望一年就算嘅。我哋因為嚟緊館都會開咧，如果能夠誒合適嘅一啲畢業生咧，係可以持續繼續喺西九文化區嗰度工作，誒即係變成咗佢一個嘅職位職業，噉啊，最理想啦。咁亦都我哋機構本身即係機構事務嗰度咧，亦都有一啲嘅職位係開畀佢哋嘅誒。

235
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:25,140
我就知道咧，因為都之前有負責開誒新聞報道工作啦。其實誒行政長官都有提到，係希望繼續創造一啲行業為本嘅職位，就係包括誒創意產業同埋文化藝術。噉我哋而家都即係同緊誒局方咧、民政事務局咧傾下，睇下會唔會可以再開多一啲誒，畀一啲大學畢業生係喺西九裏邊嘅誒一啲嘅工。

236
00:45:50,430 --> 00:46:10,440
對於誒提高青年嘅就業有幫助，我哋一定會做嘅。咁亦都我哋係會將我哋自己有嘅嘢係打通，譬如其中個個案，我哋覺得好鼓舞嘅。大家知道咧，昔日啊啊特首做誒民政局嘅上秘嘅時候，或者佢就第日誒做咗C.S.嘅時候咧，其實佢對於故宮係好重視。

237
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:30,450
咁嗰陣時咧，佢催生咗嗰個故宮實習嘅計劃嘅。噉我哋有故宮嘅實習生咧，完咗之後咧就去咗M家做實習生，做咗一年實習生之後咧，而家咧佢係誒去翻讀一個誒碩士課程，係同誒誒文化藝術相關嘅。因為我都同佢傾過咧，佢哋係。

238
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:31,810
即係戲曲中心又好，或者Empas啊，或者故宮，基本上有個已經開咗啦。咁嚟緊亦都會陸陸續續開。咁所以我自己都覺得係開始收成。咁當然啦，呢一段期間比較困難啲。咁但係有油有機啦。咁頭先即係常備都講好多劇團或者唔同已經開始用一啲新嘅模式。

239
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:27,110
咁而大灣區亦都有即係最近一啲青年嘅資助啦，即係會請一啲年青人，跟住又可能政府又資助一筆。我想問西九有冇呢一啲嘅位置咧？係都係即係聘請啲人係誒去大灣區佢誒工作，又喺香港西九度工作，變咗。

240
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:47,560
西九嘅用地，噉啊進一步拎出去，即係同一啲嘅私人合作，去做一啲嘅商業嘅項目。噉我想問下呢一步嗰個進度係點嘅？點樣可以盡快有啲商業嘅收益咧？因為之前又講即係寫字樓啊、酒店啊、即係商場。

241
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,990
多多謝主席嘅提問。咁咧，首先就講誒。

242
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:44,240
誒會唔會有幾大嘅影響咧？噉我都想瞭解下嘅，所以主要問住三個方面嘅問題先。

243
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:25,830
咁所以我諗，即係第二點喺呢度啦。第三點就係咧，其實就即係即係，琴日嘅新聞都講啦，個黎沛義工咁確診咗之後，七八人停工啦。

244
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:37,270
噉係咪就算佢驗曬都好啦？我即係其實始終呢一個都有個潛伏期㗎嘛。係咪即刻完全復曬工咧，還是會點咧？咁對於整體嘅進度，其實...

245
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:42,310
時候咧個實際嘅設施咧就更加能夠係做到呢方面嘅工作。咁對於一種我哋去內地同埋內地嘅青年嚟香港，我哋絕對係可以研究呢方面嘅一啲嘅誒互惠，即係互相認識嘅一啲嘅計劃嘅。

246
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:14,810
究竟係做咗幾多？咁同埋嚟緊即係會點樣做？因為我覺得你就算Ample又好或者故宮個收益都好呢個收入，其實都係可能即係至乎盈虧或者甚至乎係即係多啲嘅啫。但係對於要追翻西九一條數咧，其實真係要有個商業嘅收益先得嘅。

247
00:50:49,310 --> 00:51:09,320
大灣區咯，其實誒我哋都有留意到咧，最其實上個月咧應該係誒呢一個國務院啦，同埋呢個廣東省係推出咗關於大灣區嘅文化誒旅遊嘅一個嘅規劃綱要嘅。噉我哋都好開心咧睇到咧規劃綱要裏邊咧係有提到西九文化區同埋香港故宮文化博物館嘅呢兩個。

248
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:29,330
重要嘅即係誒誒發展，係希望能夠成為大灣區誒整個大灣區發文化術產業發展嘅一個重要嘅橋頭堡啦。咁所以我我自己本身都係非常之有興趣啦，去誒將西九咧向大灣區，其實整個內地啦，以至特別係大灣區嚟到推推介嘅。咁過去我哋比較困難。

249
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:49,340
因為我哋未有誒實際好多嘅設施落成啦，但係隨住嚟嘅呢兩年有咁大咁兩個世界級嘅博物館啦，我我哋覺得係一個好好嘅契機去去推廣。咁誒希望咧喺疫情稍為穩定之後咧，我哋自己都有嘅機會咧，可以去到大灣區嗰度咧去做一啲誒，譬如路演嘅工作啊，去解。

250
00:51:49,340 --> 00:52:09,350
説啊，特別係透過即係區政府咧，可以同翻大灣區我哋負責文化藝術嘅誒行誒嘅對口單位咧，嚟到去做一啲嘅即係介紹。咁如果能夠得到內地嘅誒即係九市嘅支持咧，我相信大灣區誒對嘅市民對於西九咧係會有好大興趣嘅。咁呢個係。

251
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:29,360
即係一個嘅大灣區嘅合作啦，喺青年方面咧，我我絕對睇得到咧係會有一啲嘅誒合作嘅機遇嘅，因為我哋自己本身喺西九咧，無論係誒表演藝術啦，亦或係M加啦，或者遲啲嘅故宮文化博物館咧，都會有一啲嘅internship或者即係一啲實習嘅計劃去推出嘅。誒，當特別有咗個管嘅。

252
00:52:43,050 --> 00:53:03,060
第二方面咧就係誒，主席你講得好啱啊。其實誒做文化藝術咧係唔會有錢賺嘅，所以無論係M plus或者係故宮咧，其實唔能夠單靠佢自己嗰個誒門票咧嚟到去，或者誒佢自己嘅一啲嘅誒活動展覽咧嚟到去支持到成個博物館嗰個營運。其實成個。

253
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:23,070
個西九嗰個模式咧，都係透過希望能夠喺商業嘅誒發展，包括係誒從嗰個嘅誒寫字樓啦、酒店啦，同埋係住宅項目方面能夠取得嘅一啲嘅收益，再加埋喺零售、餐飲、誒娛樂，即係RDE嗰度咧攞到嘅一啲嘅收入咧，嚟到去支持我哋嘅文化術嘅。

254
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:43,080
嗰個嘅開支嘅噉，所以咧係頭先開場嘅時候，我都講過咧。其實要快啲咧，盡快推出嗰個所謂我哋嘅H.O.R.，即係誒酒店寫字樓同埋住宅嗰個嘅嗰啲嘅嘅誒組合。咁誒，我哋其實喺跟住嗰張文件咧都有提到咧，我哋希望盡快喺上半年咧係推出到呢一個嘅。

255
00:53:43,080 --> 00:54:03,090
係誒三B，即係頭先啊，我同事司司徒先生講嘅嗰個嘅演藝劇場上蓋嘅地方咧，係嗰度會有三十一、三十二、三十四三座嘅誒商業嘅物業咧，係盡快推出，因為都少少都係即係令到我哋西九能夠咧係持續營運多一段長啲嘅。

256
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:23,100
時間噉，所以呢個係誒刻不容緩嘅。我哋係會盡快去做嘅。咁隨住三十一、三十四、誒三十二之後咧，我哋都會盡快研究喺二區第二區嘅上蓋推出埋其他嘅一啲嘅組合咧，嚟到令到我哋西九有多一啲嘅資源咧，係發展我哋嘅文化藝術方面嘅工作嘅。明白。我想即係追問少少就。

257
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,450
係。

258
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,380
test results.

259
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,970
先生，答埋嗰個進度，工程進度。

260
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,190
誒第一就係個加強版，即係財務方案咧，就係。

261
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:53,940
即係你用機就即係個業權都係西九嘛，咁呢個模式會唔會影響？即係即係影響咗，其實令到即係市場唔係對。

262
00:57:52,660 --> 00:58:03,610
As of today, we have over 500 that are back on site. Nobody is allowed back on site without obviously a negative test result.

263
00:54:54,220 --> 00:55:07,550
呢一個嘅即係特別板咁有興趣，因為可能個業權唔係佢哋去嘅時候，佢哋嘅融資啊等等咧，其實可能都有一定嘅困難嘅時候，加埋個市況而家係噉嘅時候，咁所以我就想問。

264
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:44,340
即係雖然啲地就畀咗西九，佢自己可以決定點用啦。咁但係個用就係個業權仍然係西九啊嘛。你只係不過同一啲嘅，即係可能發展商佢合作，可能批幾多年畀佢哋去即係營運。噉啊，跟住就同政府同西九去分咗。

265
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:27,840
會唔會係咁？所以就即係似乎推出個進度唔係好似原來咁咁即係咁快咧？係誒，我即係簡單講幾句。我請我哋誒嘅即係商務嘅總監去去打一打誒，總經理去打一打。其實咧，呢個都係大家會有少少擔心嘅，因為而家疫情嘅關係咧，令到整個香港經濟都係。

266
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:47,850
含於一個比較即係誒誒誒誒比較好似大家覺得個經濟發展都唔係咁好，前景可能亦都有有關心有憂慮咁誒，所以我哋都要做定一啲嘅功夫嘅，就係做一啲嘅市場嘅所謂誒，即係誒standing out。咁呢方面咧，我哋要揀一個啱嘅時候去推出呢一個嘅呢啲計劃。

267
00:55:47,850 --> 00:56:07,860
先至能夠為西九咧係攞到最大嘅利益，亦都令到市場咧係最有最大嘅興趣。咁或者請阿黃生去講一講，即係我哋而家大節上嗰個計劃係點樣樣？好啊，誒唔該誒唔該啊，Betty誒多謝主席呢個問題嘅。其實咧就誒剛才主席問誒有關話嗰個，如果我哋同開發商合作嗰個模式。

268
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:27,870
按我哋而家嗰個方向咧，會唔會喺個市場上面咧，或者可能誒有啲誒我哋猶疑咧噉樣？其實我哋誒類似嘅模式咧，其實唔係新鮮㗎啦。噉就將來我哋將我哋批出誒有關嘅發展項目嗰陣時咧，我哋會畀一個所謂一個長嘅分租協議，就畀誒有關嘅發展商嘅。噉係一個。

269
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:47,880
一個比較長期嘅一個分租裏邊的話咧，佢哋發展商係有足夠嘅能力就可以回到本，亦都可以有佢相應嘅嗰個合理嘅利潤嘅。咁變咗誒，類似噉嘅模式咧，就香港嚟講都唔係第一次。咁變咗，我哋亦都係誒按翻類似呢個模式咁去做啦。噉我亦相信咧，就誒隨住剛才阿Buddy所講。

270
00:56:47,880 --> 00:57:07,890
我哋會做一啲所謂嘅市場嘅standing out噉就會去向誒有關嘅嘅誒市場嘅人士咧，就去解釋誒呢方面我哋點樣去同佢哋合作嗰個方案嘅。噉就誒透過呢啲解釋之後咧，噉樣誒市場會更加瞭解我哋將來係究竟係會用乜嘢嘅所謂嘅business model咧去做。

271
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:27,900
呢樣嘢咯，咁呢方面我哋係而家一路一路做，而之後誒有誒有關嘅市場調查咧，係去support我哋想嚟緊會做嘅嘢嘅。咁所以我哋相信嚟緊，我哋當我哋去啟動同埋我哋去誒去做招標工作嗰陣時，都話咧，我哋有足夠嘅準備去做呢樣嘢嘅。明白明白。請阿誒司徒。

272
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,470
哦，你嗰隻手嘅，阿鄭重太醫院。

273
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:59,620
呢個小組啦，有啲嘢其實就我之前冇一點跟誒，我首先想問咧就係誒。

274
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:51,180
誒，大家都理解馮太而家其實係一個處理嘅角色嘅，佢十月七號先開始上任。

275
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:08,390
我想問嘅方向咧，其實係關於西九文化局嗰個即係而家誒管理同埋即係未來規劃嘅情況。

276
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:34,870
即係我我唔係我唔係我唔係offend啊，OK，即係形象工程居多，實際幫嗰個藝術嘅業界唔係啲咩嘢可以幫得到手。

277
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:46,830
嗯，但係咧，其實誒以西九咁大個誒計劃嚟講咧，呢段時間有啲問題其實大家都唔清楚嘅。第一樣嘢，我唔知之前有冇問過嘅，就係話其實。

278
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:15,760
And certainly, we've done our own inspections as regards the disinfection, the cleaning of the site, etc. before anybody returns.

279
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:29,950
certainly ensure that we carry on good standards。好噉，我都希望即係繼續係冇個案，同埋可以即係順利如期啦。噉我諗即係如果冇提問嘅話，我就落去下一部分嘅啦。

280
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:42,910
即刻下點解會無端端換C.O.啦？第二樣咧就誒，因為頭先主席你有問到嘅就係話，誒你期望西九文化區將來點樣發展，會唔會同大灣區諸如此類？噉我當然留意到嘅就係話，其實與會嘅朋友其實都有啲反應啦。事因嘅就係。

281
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:25,760
因為事實上咧，即係當然，我見到嘅就係話頭先誒誒各方嘅代表都有即係交代過一啲嘅工程嘅進展，又或者嘅即係而家一啲嘅即係關於誒藝團嗰啲嘅輸困計劃啦。噉我當然我理解嗰啲嘅，即係其實可能類似一啲嘅。

282
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:51,140
Yes, thank you, Chairman. Your question on the COVID case. You know, certainly we're in close contact with the contractor. We closed the site for two days. All seven hundred odd workers were sent to get.

283
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:36,050
Safety, as you as you know, remains obviously top priority of West Kowloon, and you know we will keep in very close contact with our contractors to ensure that anybody entering the site is COVID free. We've also had the Construction Industry Council.

284
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:56,060
Come down to our sites in December. They carried out, I think it was close to a thousand tests on several of our sites, and all were negative. And I think all the all the precautions that we have in place across all of our

285
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:16,070
I mean, certainly during 2020, it was a very tough year as everybody knows. But I think actually we did remarkably well, not to have any cases. So just having this one case in January, you know, it keeps everybody alert, and we'll.

286
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:54,110
係誒唔該，主席誒。我諗今日咧，即係大部分市民都係即係討論緊海洋公園啦。誒，但係其實咧，即係就咁去睇翻過去呢段時間咧，西九文文化區嗰個嘅即係誒經營嘅情況啦。咁其實都幾擔心佢會係好似海洋公園一樣嘅誒，因為我啱啱入。

287
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,450
今日。

288
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,770
就係成建商要清盤。

289
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,270
將北京。

290
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,490
無端端要賠錢畀你喎！

291
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,910
如果你話要去搞大餐，

292
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,080
大家認識祖國嘅嘢，擺嚟香港。

293
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,050
即係嗰個嗰個係係矛盾嚟嘅，我覺得。

294
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,870
跟住就係擔保人告翻個承建商。

295
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,630
咁何需要喺嗰度噉樣係揾馬會一嚿錢喺個故宮博物館啫？

296
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:40,830
喂，你點樣係孭到呢一個責任啊？作為擔保人幾慘先得㗎？

297
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:27,170
我哋已經喺度話點解開先嚟係由局方要幫承建商去電知。

298
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:19,510
嗰個所謂發展方針係咪？喂，你講完去大灣區定還是係本地嘅藝術發展咧？如果去得大灣區嘅話，使鬼喺度起個博物館咩？即係講故宮啊！

299
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:49,420
嫁架翻大陸咪得咯，走去大灣區咪完咯嗰件事，所以所以呢個係調翻轉係關於究竟個局嘅管理。

300
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:20,570
喂，如果下我知下一個item講M家，喂M家兩年之前M家西九文化局幫總建承建商去出糧畀工人嗰單嘢，我諗大家冇乜記憶啦，係咪？

301
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:07,110
究竟嚟緊個C E O係會馮太，你會再去即係頂多一段時間啦，定還是本身你個局裡面已經係有計劃咧？我如果冇嘅話，第三啦，嗰個管理嘅問題喺呢一刻先至出現嘅。

302
01:01:51,610 --> 01:02:09,970
只有六個月嘅時間留喺西九文化局，即係暫時大家再理解啦。咁究竟其實而家局方係積極揾緊新嘅CEO啊，正式係會去take up呢個局啊，定還是都係睇餸食飯先？如果係嘅話，即係大家會好擔心嘅就係其實究竟。

303
01:00:47,110 --> 01:01:07,120
我作為一個即係公眾市民，我想知前一任嘅C.E.O點解會突然間唔做嘅，即係佢自己唔做啊，即係講柏志高啊，點解點解突然間換咗個C.E.O咧？即係有冇政府或者係局方嘅係對朝公眾解説過係佢誒個人嘅問題啊，定或？

304
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:27,130
還是嘅就係即係可能西九文化局，可能甚至政府喺嗰個文化嘅即係未來計劃上有啲變化噉，所導致咧噉。因為事實上呢個幾影響成個局佢哋喺呢個期間對於嗰個嘅地嗰個嗰個區域嘅發展嘅。噉我希望嘅就係應間誒可以有代表解。

305
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,840
噉你哋係做緊乜咧？

306
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,210
淪落到成係一個影日落嘅環境。

307
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,250
嘅地方，大家而家淨係喺嗰度影日落。

308
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,730
冇人解釋過究竟西九文化區嘅管理層發生緊咩事。

309
01:03:55,970 --> 01:04:00,150
所以你話喂，講到啲嘢幾漂亮都好啦，大家就想知。

310
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:21,600
可唔可以解釋我三個問題咧？唔該，主席。我諗呢個問題請常秘去回應啦。

311
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:49,740
但係呢件事係柏志高離任之後，而家先係上法庭爆出嚟喎。

312
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:07,250
我唔會話奢求你點樣幫到藝術業界，我只係奢求咁大片咁美好。

313
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:34,670
我哋永遠講文化藝術嘅時候，係講一個economic rate of return，佢能夠帶動到整體經濟嘅發展。

314
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:31,160
誒主席，我首先誒多謝阿鄭議員嘅問題。我首先會誒誒盡量解答，然後一陣間阿馮太或者管理局嘅其他同事睇下有冇補充啊。

315
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:27,030
喺誒誒第一季尾咧係攞到錢，咁而家仲起緊，所以佢上季無論係文化誒文化藝術啦，或者係商業營運嘅設施咧，到而家嚟講仍係一個概念未出世嘅，咁所以我覺得兩者係唔可以誒相比啦。

316
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:51,450
咁首先咧，誒，我覺得誒海洋公園同西九係誒兩個好唔同嘅誒發展階段。當然，我對海洋公園亦都即係認識，唔係話唔能夠講好深啦。但係海洋公園已經係一個誒已經係完成咗嘅誒營運緊嘅誒長。

317
01:04:51,450 --> 01:05:11,460
地嚟嘅，佢亦都係因為疫情有受打擊，但係相對於西九咧，其實佢而家仲係陸續興建中嘅。咁其實西九好大部分嘅場地咧，其實係仲未起緊，因為大家都知道咧，佢係有個誒地庫嘅，有個綜合地庫。個綜合地庫咧，其實喺上年先至喺。

318
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:47,490
咁主頭先其實頭先啲問題，因為時間超時，我都即係冇冇解釋到啦嚇。因為其實講產業化或者同大灣區嘅關係咧，其實嚴格嚟講咧，呢個一個政府政策嘅行為嚟嘅。咁而西九咧，我哋點解會有一個噉嘅文化區嘅概念咧？因為大家其實未有西九之前，就算而家起。

319
01:05:47,490 --> 01:06:07,500
埋西九，其實我哋嘅文化設施咧，都係遠遠咧係誒唔能夠全部係應付到業界嘅訴求嘅。就知個西九嘅做法咧，就係話誒，唔係話呢度一舊嗰個舊園係集中去，令到佢有一個協同嘅效應，嗰度可以製造到嗰個對產業。

320
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:27,510
對我哋經濟嘅批更加大，噉我覺得當處理西九呢個問題，就好似我哋喺整個香港處理文化藝術，要將兩個概念係分開，一個叫financial rate of return係財務嘅嘅誒進帳嚇，咁呢個正如頭先阿馮太講，文化藝術係噉你睇佢本身盤漲係唔會賺錢嘅，所以。

321
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,580
嗱，第一。

322
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,080
唔係主主席。

323
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,730
藝術發展局啊做嘅，噉我哋其實喺二零一。

324
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,330
對於文化藝術係有認識咧，對做起上嚟咧就會更貼近到係。

325
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:03,800
奇蹟咧，佢有唔同嘅原因。咁阿柏志高先生佢離任咧，係同西九管理局自己係雙方協議嘅。

326
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:35,340
九年咧係交咗畀西九做嘅嚇，咁最近誒share啲嘢都再再做過啦嚇，西九將佢嗰個。

327
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:44,340
譬如包括係啲人因為呢個誒生活嘅質素提高嚟香港嘅投資啊、誒旅遊啊，或者願意嚟香港係工作噉樣樣。

328
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:11,070
我哋其實喺好多好多嘅嘢咧，喺我哋出去嘅時候咧，我哋係預埋西九。譬如話兩年一度，我哋有個文化部長嘅會議咧，我哋誒都有去誒邀請西九嘅代表嚟，同埋係向啲與會者係展示西九呢個概念嘅。

329
01:06:44,730 --> 01:07:04,740
咁喺呢度咧，如果講產業化，我好簡單講咧，係話你有出入同埋人三個角度去睇嘅。譬如呢一方面咧，我哋其實政府係好知道咧。當我哋創造咗西九文化區呢一個噉嘅政策出嚟咧，我哋其實過去一段時間咧，縱使文化區仍然啲基礎建設同埋佢嘅設施。

330
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:24,750
只只係尚在逐步落成嘅階段，其實有好多嘢咧，我哋已經係誒有噉嘅計劃去幫助西九文化區咧誒做大做強嘅。譬如每兩年一次喺威尼斯嘅雙年展，以前咧係誒政府同埋相關一啲誒誒，譬如。

331
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:55,630
攞咗嚟香港展覽。噉我哋做香港州嘅時候咧，其實我哋都冇忘記西九嘅。其實頭先阿Betty講嗰兩個關於喺西九做緊嘅項目，就係文港探谷同埋係霸王誒霸王別姬咧。其實我哋都針緊，如果香港州恢復翻嘅時候咧，都會係請西九去嘅。咁所以我。

332
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:31,360
咁另外咧，佢關於入嗰方面咧，其實大家唔知知唔知道咧。其實如果對嗰個誒銀碼嚟講咧，香港係全世界第三大嘅誒文物嘅個交易中心嚟嘅。咁另外咧，喺香喺你哋即即大家有數嘅關於誒拍賣行啊一啲，其實香港。

333
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:51,370
都有分行嘅噉。另外咧，我哋呢啲係佢哋長期喺度做生意啦。另外短期嘅，我哋有Upbar和Upcentral。咁疫情之下咧，政府亦都對佢哋係提供咗支援嘅。咁至於誒誒產業化方面，我哋除咗係話文化表演同埋策展者咧，其實我哋而家都積極咧開拓緊一啲誒。

334
01:08:51,370 --> 01:09:11,380
與文化藝術相關嘅一啲職位同行業嘅，譬如包括曬係誒，包括文化嘅管理啦（art administration）同埋誒相關嘅行業，我哋覺得係仲有係好大嘅增長空間嘅。譬如關於相關嘅誒會計啊、誒物流啊等等嚇，因為呢啲咧其實咧，如果佢都

335
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:36,650
文化藝術界所需要嘅嘢嘅，譬如佢哋入大灣區都需要好多行業嘅服務。咁至於頭先你講，所以你話誒，即係西九文化局文化區到而家對業界誒幫況唔係好大啊，或者我覺得係睇目前嚟講係因為有個疫情嘅籠罩下咧，我諗唔止香港係整體全。

336
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:56,660
世界好多業務咧，都係同平常係即係誒落差好大嘅。咁但係我哋當希望個疫情過咗之後，同埋西九嘅誒硬件設施逐步落成咧，我希望係帶到一個新嘅景象。我哋都對此有信心。到最後咧誒，講埋阿總裁噉，即係唔同嘅人嚟。

337
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:46,960
自顧人士。

338
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,820
藝術業嘅。

339
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,020
唔係，即係我。

340
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,470
講咗咁耐。

341
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,290
我都好脾氣啊，相對。

342
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,280
一係喺學校度做導師。

343
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,870
即係蛙嗰啲表演啊！

344
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,690
好啦，講翻我基本嗰兩個問題。

345
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,850
單純海洋公園都話畀你聽，個結論就係噉。

346
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:14,390
其實你講到個將來個畫面幾美好，畀我聽都好啦。

347
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:55,230
你話西九，你嗰三百萬只係我相信係叫管理層。

348
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:19,190
誒，如果你話幫到藝術人士，我即係希望民政局可以做一個即係認真嘅研究咯。

349
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:45,650
過去噉嘅疫症咧，係淨係得導師嗰份有少少錢補貼喺個業界嘅啫，因為佢哋全部都係炒散。

350
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:05,390
好心形象上幫一幫個業界，以政府嘅角度嚟講，唔好意思啊，民政局，我睇唔到過去呢段期間係可以做啲乜嘢係幫到。

351
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:24,880
你一日唔能夠解釋畀我知究竟西九局個CEO係咩事嘅話，唔好意思，我一日都係唔會信任呢一個嘅計劃嘅。

352
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:32,910
誒有幾多藝術人，尤其係舞蹈員啦，或者係做視覺啊或者音樂嘅人員咧？香港其實咧讀藝術嘅人好慘啊！你一係走咗去做迪士尼。

353
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,120
就係兩次啫。

354
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,640
你應該啊。

355
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:59,410
當個C.O.走咗。

356
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,860
然後就過咗半年啦。

357
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,670
你可唔可以話我知？

358
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,320
嗰個係你個團隊點樣運作嘅問題咧？

359
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,910
喂，出出封email講兩句就唔知去咗邊咯～

360
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:55,470
係嘅，喂，但係管理係咩回事先？

361
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:23,720
而家係連個C.E.O.都唔知喺邊喎。

362
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:33,240
你可以一個咁大嘅發展，個C.E.O。

363
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,830
馮太你atting半年，啲半年你走上嚟答立法會兩次。

364
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:45,790
你個團隊坐埋啊，十個percent跌出嚟，每人都三啊三百萬啊，講緊。

365
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:51,940
唔好講幾多錢啦，但係最少我相信個團隊，你應該係一個專業嘅團隊嚟嘅。

366
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:17,990
跟住嚟緊，本身嚟緊年底M plus按按schedule啊，呢個夏天第一攞嘅活動推出嘅。

367
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:32,350
咁大家就會問嘅就係你個文化區，你真係有心做幫你做西九文化藝術嘅同事，你個團隊。

368
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:53,240
點做落去啊？即係我呢個問題，我係我係代表緊整個團隊去問嚟政府啊嘛，係咪啊？我諗嗱，第一即係今日以前嘅時間都差唔多啦，咁所以我都畀你講埋。咁第二咧就係其實我都認同西九同海洋公園有啲唔同嘅，最低限度就係海洋公園嗰啲地唔係屬。

369
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:43,150
層唔係一個人嘅工作，係整個團隊嘅工作，亦都更加要強調咧。

370
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:30,350
咁誒，其實可能頭先都有提過少少啦，噉就咁呢度亦都交個時間畀管理局嘅同事。

371
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:37,220
係誒處理緊一啲誒所謂recruitment誒招聘嘅事，咁喺任何一個大機構入邊咧，誒唔係靠一兩個人做，係靠個團隊。咁或者我請阿馮太補充。

372
01:12:53,240 --> 01:13:06,160
於佢嘅，咁所以佢想再發展都係有好多侷限。咁但係最少即係西九仲有好多地係可以做啲商業模式去運作啦。咁個問題就係邊一個係最好嘅時間同埋最好嘅利益嘅啫。

373
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:22,810
即係新嘅小組成員，所以佢誒未必有留意到上次阿阿阿館長嘅介紹啦，嚇。好唔該曬。噉我諗呢個議程都好充分討論嘅啦。咁算我哋就到此為止。另外一個咧，亦都係西九文化區三區嘅最新發展。

374
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:26,460
咁第三就係即係因為你可能都係第一次加入會啦，咁即係C.O.嘅換當然啦，即係係西九佢個董事會嘅決定，但係對於即係上一任嘅，我諗我哋參與會嘅同事，大家心目中都各有評價嘅，咁所以我諗睇下誒上邊會唔會回應埋，可能個任期個。

375
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:46,470
時間個長短會唔會影響到嘅啫？誒，多謝主席誒，多謝鄭議員嘅問題誒。首先咧，我有一個誒澄清啦，即係我哋幫文化界別咧係唔止西九誒佢哋高層自掏腰包嗰三百多萬啦，其實喺誒抗疫基金同埋係誒民政局通過資源咧誒其。

376
01:13:46,470 --> 01:14:06,480
實咧，誒就喺金錢上咧，援助都係超過一億七千多萬嘅。噉我唔喺呢度詳述啦，因為誒政府係畀咗幾份文件係立法會嘅。咁至於誒阿柏志高先生嘅離任，正如我講咧，係佢同管理局嘅雙方協議。咁阿馮太嚟誒西九咧，係政府一個借調嘅安排。佢而家仍然。

377
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:26,490
係屬於誒特區公務員嘅一員嘅，只不過而家係借調咗嚟，借調期係半年嘅。咁而家阿馮太咧，亦都係公務員事務局長誒，素來係對誒政務主任咧係個調任咧係有呢個誒主決權嘅。咁據我理解咧，誒即係西九咧，而家亦都係。

378
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:58,130
多謝誒，秘書長。多謝鄭議員嘅提問。誒，我我頭先啊，就係啊啊，秘書長有提到啦，我嘅任期咧係大約係半年啦，就係因為亦都根據一貫嘅借調高級公務員嘅做法咧，就一般嚟講，首長級公務員都係借調六個月。咁其實誒，我我都有少少優勢嘅坐落嚟，因為之前我亦都有跟開西九呢一個。

379
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:18,140
嘅計劃，所以其實十月七號之後上任之後咧，我已經係積極係同我嘅團隊咧係一齊去同策劃嚟緊呢一年嘅工作，亦都正值咧我哋係做緊我哋嚟緊二零二一年同二二年嗰個嘅業務計劃。咁所以喺呢段時間咧，我哋都係冇停過任何嘅工作，唔係因為換咗人咧，我哋就去嗰誒停。

380
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:38,150
停頓落嚟，我又要去做熟習啲乜嘢，係並冇收冇用到任何嘅時間，係去誒坐低落嚟再去慢慢睇，亦已經積極投入咗工作。咁誒，我自己感受到啦，我哋嘅團隊係一個非常之專業嘅團隊，每一個人都係喺佢自己嘅崗位上面咧係盡心盡力咁去做。咁所以咧，就正如秘書長講咧，西九管理局嘅管理。

381
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:27,920
嗯。

382
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,830
Thank you, Chairman.

383
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,350
好，可以介紹嘅啦。OK。

384
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,460
In terms of delaying some of the supply chain for the building materials.

385
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:05,310
劇院複合、Our Artist Square，和The Developments That Go Above。

386
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:29,510
We also updated the subcommittee on the construction and the progress of the M+ museum back in November.

387
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:35,970
and obviously the restrictions on local resources, even the closure of factories in mainland China, and subsequently globally.

388
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:21,200
So, moving on to the M+ project in 2020, COVID-20 COVID-19 pandemic certainly had an adverse impact on the progress of the project.

389
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:49,480
The authority has been working closely with our management contractor that we appointed to manage the construction of the project to mitigate all the adverse impacts of the pandemic.

390
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:20,530
Members may recall at the meeting in 2019, the authority briefed members on the progress of the Lyric Theatre project, including the architectural design development and procurement of the main works packages.

391
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:26,420
on the 24th of December 2020, and I would just like to put on record our thanks to the Buildings Department and the Fire Services Department for all their great efforts and support throughout that process.

392
01:18:49,800 --> 01:19:06,950
和也WKC A Tower，和然後黃色區域到右邊，就是Lyric Theatre，和你可以看到三個頂樓商業發展，和也RT Square Bridge。

393
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:47,080
Currently, we're just completing the fitting out works of the office floors in the tower, which are substantially completed, and then we move on to the fitting out of some of the revenue areas, the food and beverage outlets, the museum shops, learning hub, cinemas.

394
01:15:43,430 --> 01:16:03,440
董事局咧係畀好多嘅指導我哋嘅。誒董事局每一個月都開會，董事局下邊亦都有唔同嘅委員會，有行政委員會、表演藝術委員會。誒加M加嘅公司嘅董事局，誒香港故宮文化博物館嘅董事局，佢哋其實係跟進每一件事，係去到好誒，即係清楚。

395
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:23,450
嘅一啲嘅指導方向咧，都係畀得好足嘅。咁所以，我哋團隊只要跟住呢啲指導方向去做咧，其實係就算換咗一個嘅行政總裁，都唔係話所有工作停頓下來。當然，去招聘翻呢一個行政總裁係一件急不容緩嘅事。而西九管理局嘅董事董事局咧，我知道咧，佢哋已經係開展咗呢方面嘅工作。雖然我

396
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:43,460
自己冇參與其中，但係佢哋係積極咁去做緊嘅。呢個係我嘅據我嘅瞭解嘅。好唔該曬。噉我亦都相信，即係過去你你登入常備嘅時候都有跟翻，咁所以都喺個即係take up嘅工作嘅時候，亦都唔會再浪費花時間嘅。誒，主席唔好意思，我做一個補充啫，因為頭先阿鄭議員雖然佢而家離場，佢即係我唔想。

397
01:16:43,460 --> 01:17:03,470
誒喺個記錄上，我哋冇講呢一點啦。係正如喺上次開會咧，誒，故宮文化博物館嘅館長亦都解釋過，故宮文化博物館並不是北京博物館嘅分館嚟嘅。我哋有唔同自己嘅策展方向噉，或者請秘書處之後將嗰份文件交翻畀阿鄭議員，因為我哋知道佢係一個新嘅議員，所以佢係。

398
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:59,120
So this second item is an update on the latest development of the Zone Three area of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and that area comprises the M Plus Museum, the conservation storage facility, also the Lyric Theatre.

399
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:49,800
So today just provides a further update on the latest progress that we have on those projects. So on the screen there, the yellow and the blue area. The blue area is the M Plus development, which comprises the museum, the storage facility.

400
01:19:50,150 --> 01:20:10,160
And I'm pleased to say that, despite a tough year or two, the buildings for the museum and the conservation storage facility have now been completed. And as CEO acting referred to in her opening remarks, our OP was obtained.

401
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,710
嗯。

402
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,180
to use accordingly.

403
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,230
finalise testing.

404
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,520
and obviously the reception area.

405
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,980
你可以睇到有啲畫廊係已經完成。

406
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:24,180
M Plus is served by an underground road.

407
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:51,420
In the district, to about four hundred and eighty during the weekends and the public holidays.

408
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:09,370
Obviously, some of the gallery floors have protection on at the moment, which is in that picture to the right-hand side.

409
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:58,930
The museum is working in full steam with the preparation for the opening exhibitions targeted towards the end of 2021.

410
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:34,170
With a provision of drop-off facilities and around 150 permanent underground parking spaces, which are embedded below the building.

411
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:45,400
The car park has been open to the public since December 30th of December 2020, and we've increased the car parking provision.

412
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:17,890
When the Lyric Theatre and the Topside commercial developments in Zone Three B are completed in two thousand and twenty-four, the relevant section of the underground road will be open to the public.

413
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:58,020
You can see here some of the internal pictures of the fit out that are going on, timber floors that are being laid, the learning hub area within the museum.

414
01:21:51,720 --> 01:22:05,730
During this initial phase, the underground road will be opened in the second quarter of two thousand and twenty-one this year, and it'll serve the museum, the storage facility and the WKCA tower.

415
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:19,060
We also have the testing and the commissioning of the external LED facade lighting, which is underway, which will show animations and colour patterns on the facade, which are visible from the Victoria Harbour. And I have a slide on that to come.

416
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:42,120
So just on the screen there, you can see a couple of images of the LED facade which I referred to. The logo on the left, and that's just a test image, which is on the right. But the public may see a few more of these over the next few weeks as we finalise.

417
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:09,980
嗯。

418
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,430
嗯。

419
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,280
was awarded back in January 16.

420
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:08,730
which my commercial colleagues are handling.

421
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:56,090
rent out to generate income for the authority.

422
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,160
The piling foundation works, which was called our F2 contract for the Lyric Theatre.

423
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:03,090
所以，如果我 move on to the lyric theatre project and the integrated basement.

424
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:52,110
The flaws that are not taken by the authority, obviously, we will be looking to.

425
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:37,110
The practical completion certificate for the majority of these foundation works was issued in January 2018.

426
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:19,320
And as I was referring to earlier, the underground car parking spaces which were made available on the thirtyth of December.

427
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:29,340
On the right-hand side, there you can see some of the office area, which is in the tower for the museum staff.

428
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:46,100
Kowloon and one on Hong Kong Island will be consolidated as we move into this tower. It's currently being fitted out, and we aim to move into that tower probably somewhere around April this year.

429
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:29,410
That foundation contract covers the installation of the peripheral elements, the vertical pipe piles for the excavation and lateral support, of the temporary cofferdam wall system, around the whole of the 3B site.

430
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:45,550
這些圖片係從 conservation storage facility，呢個係一種七至八層樓的建築，喺度，好多藝術作品會被儲存，同維修、維護等都會喺度進行。

431
01:23:45,860 --> 01:24:05,870
And then we also have WKCA Tower, which is core and shell building, which has been constructed. And you can see there, we have the common area, which will be the lobby, and then we also have commercial spaces which are available to rent.

432
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:30,270
We have finished the tower as far as the construction goes, and we're due to secure the occupation's permit on that very shortly. It will be the new head office for the authority, and all of our temporary offices, which are currently located in.

433
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,380
係。

434
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,710
which was issued in February eighteen.

435
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:59,690
從The Airport Express and Tong Chung Line tunnels.

436
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:15,060
With regard to the L one contract, at the end of November two thousand and twenty.

437
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:35,600
The architectural builders' work and finishes in the Lyric Theatre and the integrated basement.

438
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:17,610
and the essential basement structure to support the lyric theatre superstructure.

439
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:44,820
And that for the remaining works around the MTRC Airport Express and the Tsung Chung line.

440
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:08,880
And the system is installed by the L two contractor above the pile cap and base slabs, which are constructed by L one.

441
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:25,170
Over 90% of the scope of the works had been completed. By around the end of January, we will be at around 95%.

442
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:16,950
The construction of this basement structure has enabled the commencement of the L2 superstructure to proceed.

443
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:28,620
The L2 contract is the contract for constructing the Lyric Theatre building itself, which includes obviously the superstructure, the building services.

444
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:36,020
The progress of the L1 contract has been affected by a combination of factors since its commencement in January 2018.

445
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:49,030
Members will recall, we reported about the flooding incident that occurred in July two thousand and nineteen, which were reported to the committee in November two thousand and nineteen.

446
01:27:49,440 --> 01:28:06,800
Since then, through remedial and preventative measures that were implemented, considerable progress has been made on the basement structure, as well as the construction of the 70-metre-long post-tensioning concrete beams spanning over the airport railway.

447
01:25:48,120 --> 01:26:08,130
The remaining works for the lyric theatre and the integrated basement in zone three B are covered by two works contracts. Firstly, the L one contract, which covers the remaining ELS system, the excavation works, pile caps, which

448
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:55,930
We have expressed before that the lyric theatre is a unique building in that it has a structural isolation spring damper system, which is provided as part of the contract, and this provides the necessary acoustic isolation from any vibration that's emanating.

449
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,280
嗯。

450
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,230
limits.

451
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:40,700
emphasis is being placed on coordinating.

452
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:28,070
and it has a completion date around the end of 2023.

453
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,470
As regards the L2 contract, which is a superstructure, this commenced in November 2018.

454
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:36,580
The moment the L two contractor employs about three hundred workers on site.

455
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:13,430
一 large part of the southern section of the site, which you can see here on the slide.

456
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:49,120
The information between both L one and L two, the castings, the building services and the builders' works and finishes.

457
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:38,740
The damper system is an important and unique feature, and it protects the structure of the Lyric Theatre from all of the surrounding ground noise and vibration.

458
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:27,930
And as at the end of November 2020, 75% of the isolation springs and the damper system have been installed on the basement structure.

459
01:29:54,610 --> 01:30:05,400
And this also targets to substantially complete the underground road in Zone 3B also by the end of 2022.

460
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:54,330
The op date for the Lyric Theatre is now set for around the fourth quarter of two thousand and twenty-three, and the practical completion in early two thousand and twenty-four.

461
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:42,480
to address the delays which arose out of the complications on the L1 contract, the L2 contractor has revisited the construction sequence and we've updated the overall programme.

462
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:15,820
所以 for the L1 contract is expected it'll be substantially completed by March, and there will be some minor utilities works will be completed outside of the zone 3B in the second quarter.

463
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:30,260
has been made available for access for the L two contractor in two thousand and nineteen, and as I said earlier, that's where he's commenced installation of the vibration isolation springs and constructing the superstructure.

464
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:59,200
as regards the critical proximity of the airport railway and the Tongchong tunnels to the Lyric Theatre, the construction has carefully managed that and the settlement has been well within the MTRC Corporation sett

465
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,580
好，唔該曬都詳細解釋。

466
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,790
also the facade and mock-up.

467
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,180
咁而家咧，就好似睇嚟係未決定到個。

468
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:05,430
噉我而家亦都將個時間交畀委員提問啦，每人四分鐘。誒，首先周鈺玲議員。

469
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:50,570
It's hoped that these will be completed by two thousand and twenty-four.

470
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:56,680
So, thank you, Chairman. That concludes the presentation on Zone 3B.

471
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:35,630
本來喺一九年中咧，就管理局係就住A.C.E項目咧，就誒即係邀請大家個意向書，咁誒。

472
01:30:53,300 --> 01:31:07,590
So finally, our paper also refers to the topside commercial developments that will will be built above this whole integrated basement area in Zone Three.

473
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:50,280
當時係定喺二零二零年，即係舊年四月展開個招標工作啦。不過就後來因為疫情嘅關係啦，咁八月嘅時候，舊年咧就管理局係決定就暫時撤回嗰個A C E項目嘅招標。

474
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:24,380
The foundation works for those topside commercial developments have been completed, and as part of the L1 works, we are constructing the IB structure and the car parking, which will be, as I say, will be completed around March.

475
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:53,770
暫時局方嘅評估幾時會再開翻呢個招標，或者會點樣做咧？因為我擔心嗰個誒帶嚟嘅財政嘅收入係誒，或者個壓力係有嘅。如果你而家即係hold住咗呢個嘅處理，噉我想聽聽局方我個講法。唔該。好啊，誒。

476
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:44,670
The L two contractor will then undertake all the final fitout works, and will be obtaining the OP, so that the sites can then be handed over to the future developers. Subject to the outcome of the tender exercise for the topside commercial developments.

477
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:26,610
誒唔該啊，主席。誒，我呢一個議程咧，我比較關心咧，就係關於個A C E個發展組合嘅問題。因為嗱，根據文件所講啦，即係誒，本來係有應該講係四萬七千平方米嘅藝術啊、商業同展覽空間啦。咁誒。

478
01:32:54,460 --> 01:33:14,470
誒新嗰個推展或者係招標嘅方式或者處理，我就喺呢方面我就有啲誒擔心，因為誒嗰個據我瞭解咧，就誒呢個A C E項目嘅處理咧，就主要係可以幫嗰個管理局或者成個項目咧都帶嚟相當嘅財政收入嘅。

479
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:34,480
噉，但係而家咧，因為就停咗，噉就冇冇進行招標啦。即係又唔知幾時會再開，即係開翻重啟翻嗰個招標嘅處理。咁對於未來整個管理局嗰個財政嘅安排咧，即係呢一個嘅處理啊個影響會係點咧？同埋即係你哋而家集。

480
01:33:54,050 --> 01:34:14,060
多謝誒周議員嘅提問啦，都係關於我哋誒管理局嗰個商業發展嘅即係個情況啦。咁正如我哋喺文件講咧，而家我哋嗰個優先嗰個處理咧，就會係誒頭先啊司徒先生講三十一、三十二、三十四嗰三個嘅組合，就係我哋叫做誒藝術廣。

481
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:38,090
咧嚟到去誒，幫我哋係去誒嚟引持續。

482
01:35:53,190 --> 01:36:01,870
文化區嗰個嘅財政狀況係好重要嘅，咁所以我哋都會諗唔同嘅一個嘅組合嘅模式。誒，我相信喺

483
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:12,500
唔會係一個好長嘅時間之後咧，我哋都要再再推出呢一個嘅組合㗎啦。咁嗰個模式係點咧？我哋而家都做緊一啲嘅研究，係點樣先可以攞到最大嘅效益畀西九管理局？

484
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:12,890
誒寫字樓同埋酒店，再要起埋一個四萬七千平方米嘅誒展覽中心，咁結果咧個市場反應翻嚟咧，都話咗畀我哋聽係誒噉嘅一個組合咧，喺而家呢個狀況、經濟嘅狀況咧。

485
01:37:54,140 --> 01:38:08,960
言判咁誒，我哋係將嚟誒五月份咧，我哋會翻嚟西九誒，翻嚟呢個聯合嘅委員會咧，我哋會再去交代我哋成個西九嗰個而家最新估計嗰個財務嘅狀況。噉我希望到時我哋會有多啲資料可以交代嘅。

486
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:34,070
長大樓而家叫做Art Square Towers嘅一個處理，咁呢個會快嘅，即係我哋希望第二季咧可以出到招標。咁有咗呢一個咧，如果能夠帶嚟一啲嘅收益咧，誒應該係可以幫到管理局嗰個財政狀況。即係大家可能喺過去嘅會議都知道，管理局嘅財政狀況都幾個比較即係惡劣嘅，係需要呢一啲錢。

487
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:58,430
長一啲時間嘅營運嘅咁誒呢一個咧就頭先啊啊啊黃總經理都提到咧，就係我哋都有信心嘅。我哋而家都做緊一啲所謂market sounding out。但至於呢一個誒A C E咧誒，正如議員提到咧，就係喺去年嘅時候咧，我哋係拎咗出嚟投標，但係當時嗰個組合咧就係唔單止要興建。

488
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:33,180
同埋誒香港整體嗰個會展嘅樓面咧，都會有喺其他嘅地方咧係有所增加嘅。譬如喺誒啱啱今年嘅施政，舊年嘅施政報告咧，二零二零咧都提到會發展呢一個嘅誒推展呢一個會展嘅第三期啦，包括誒呢一個亞洲博覽館嘅第二期，亦都係會推展。咁所以整體嚟講，

489
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:53,190
對於展覽場地嗰個需求咧，我哋而家都要再睇一睇，喺短時間內係咪可以即係市場有噉嘅興趣，既發展物業、誒寫字樓同埋酒店，亦都發展埋同時呢一個嘅展覽中心咧。噉我哋係而家都係抱住一個開放態度去檢討呢一個嘅組合，但係唔可以否認嘅就係呢一個組合對於西九。

490
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:34,100
主席，主席，如果我我問多少少得唔得？好，唔好意思啊，對唔住，因為因為因為乘住啱啱佢咁講，我都想問，即係誒，但係你有冇評估過，即係本身如果呢個ACE誒啟動咗啦，即係如果啊，假設當日啟動咗，誒，你哋可唔可以話畀我聽，當時你哋預估可以即刻帶嚟誒幾多？

491
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:54,110
多嘅誒每年嘅收益嘅咧，即係即係即係，但係當然啦，因為你當時未招啦，你你你未知啦，理論上就應該招咗先知啦。不過你都有個估計㗎嘛，即係如果你哋當時可唔可以透露下，如果當日成行嘅，你哋自己估計心裡面估計有冇個底，覺得應該要幾多收入都可以帶到畀你哋？

492
01:36:54,110 --> 01:37:14,120
嘅咧，即係我我都想了解下啫。估計啫嚇，估計啫。多謝議員嘅提問。當然我自己未參加呢個工作啦，因為舊年做招標嘅時候，即係你都提到嗰個時間就係誒八月份，我哋係誒撤回咗呢個標嘅。咁但係誒而家呢一刻，我哋去講翻一個已經即係撤回咗嘅標咧，都唔係好公道嚇。實際。

493
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:34,130
數字我亦都唔知，所以我亦都無從去解畀你睇係點樣樣。咁但係將來我哋再諗個組合嘅時候咧，我哋都一定會計好嗰條數。究竟如果做咗呢個招標，能唔能夠幫到管理局去持續一段比較長時間盈温？因為其實我哋實在可以發展嘅得四樣嘢嘅啫，大舊嘅一個就係頭先我哋講三啊一、三啊二、三。

494
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:54,140
廿四啦，跟住就係呢個A C嘅組合啦，跟住二A上蓋嘅發展啦，同埋二B都係一啲誒所謂H O R嘅意思就唔得㗎啦，意思就係因為係一個文化藝術嘅設施嚟嘅，咁所以呢四樣嘢我哋點樣能夠喺個市場嘅承受能力、市場嘅興趣，以及對西九帶嚟最大嘅效益咧？呢度咧，我哋都要即係再要做一啲。

495
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:29,250
但係，如果如果我我頭先我係聽咧，即係啊嗰個會展嗰個位置啊，即係啊，應該講個會展嗰個誒誒提供到嘅場地嘅量啊，即係因為啱啱頭先我就話咧，而家見到可能政府又有即係啊新嘅一啲會展嘅地方供應。

496
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:49,260
咁可能就擔心，即係會唔會市場即係因為呢個會展嘅嘅安排，即係即係未必一定有興趣咧，因為多咗供應啊嘛。即係我聽到個講法係噉，但係容許我真係咁講一句，如果如果係噉嘅，但係會唔會其實你哋當初即係一個比較長遠嘅規劃嘅時候，其實都有諗過呢啲會。

497
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:25,970
嗯，好，得啊。

498
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,400
事實上，其實就即係。

499
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:31,860
誒嗰個地契上邊咧，其實最重要咧，誒。

500
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:24,520
元素啊，誒公共空間啊，同埋車位嘅限制嘅，咁只要西九喺發展嘅期間係滿足咗呢一啲嘅規範咧，其實政府係畀咗好大自由度西九嘅。

501
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:42,970
其實我啱啱正正想即係都接住來都想補充下，就係咧，我都知道個A C E咧，其實一改再改，最初係一萬個表演場地啦，咁跟住因為啟德體育園嘅關係啦，跟住又改咗呢個即係組合啦，噉。

502
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:27,540
西九發展佢嘅文化藝術嘅工作嘅咁而喺我哋個地契嗰方面咧，誒一定要佢嘗試去做呢個誒會展嘅。但係如果佢去招標咗之後市場反應唔得咧，其實我哋冇強制佢嘅，因為喺嗰個誒。

503
01:38:49,260 --> 01:39:09,270
會展係會有咁多供應咧，即即例如，比如話誒，政府喺計劃規劃嚟話，而家嗰幾棟即係灣仔嘅要搬走佢啦，等等嘅頂頂即係整呢啲噉嘅噉嘅做法，其實你哋會唔會喺最初期嘅時候都有諗過，即係呢啲會展其實恐真都會多咗。

504
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:29,280
好咧，即係所以，我我就想問一問呢樣嘢，即係係咪而家先至發覺，即係多得滯咁咧？對唔對啊？或者誒，阿Betty或者常秘講嘅時候，我都想講嘅。或者我講，因為當時去設計嗰個嘅加強財務安排，都係即係當時我正正係坐喺阿謝太個位，係呢一個嘅誒常任秘書長。

505
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:49,290
其實當時咧，我哋喺二零一六年一年尾一七年頭去推出呢一個加強財務安排嘅時候咧，係提出喺會展嘅喺嗰個時候先提出嘅。之前唔係一個會展嘅設施嚟嘅。噉就因為有見於咧誒，當時喺香港嚟講咧，嗰個表演嘅場地咧係多咗好多倍，尤其是譬如當年體育園。

506
01:39:49,520 --> 01:40:09,530
誒起好之後有一個五萬位嘅大型嘅一個嘅可以做演唱會嘅場地，佢亦都會有一個一萬位嘅室內嘅運動場，亦都可以做演唱會。加埋紅館係唔拆，於是當時時咧，我哋睇到咧會展咧，可能呢種設施咧，香港係有一個嘅訴求嘅，實在都係當時係好多要求嘅誒香港會展展覽中。

507
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:29,540
心係滿足唔到，但係當時我記憶中咧係會展誒亞博館二期咧係未拍板嘅，即係當然有講，但係未拍板。而我哋當時睇過一啲嘅誒內部分析咧，嚇灣仔三期亦都未未未正式拍板嘅，咁所以當時淨係得沙中線上蓋會展站係有一個小型嘅會展設。

508
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:49,550
我哋當時睇係有咗呢個需要嘅，但係到而家經歷咗咁幾年之後，又再多咗咁多嘅供應嘅時候咧，而家再可能都再要睇翻究竟會展係咪一種最切合西九需要嘅一種設施咯嚇。噉就係因為我已經都離開咗兩年，所以都請阿，嗯，誒，其實阿阿主席，誒。

509
01:40:49,550 --> 01:41:09,560
誒議員其實啊，馮太記憶力好好，咁其實佢講咗一部分我想講嘅嘢。另外咧，即係當初有呢個A.C.E嘅組合咧，係純粹政府係想畀西九最大嘅彈性，利用佢呢啲商業元素咧，係可以長遠地係畀咗一個誒收入嘅來源去呢個。

510
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:52,350
如果係話我哋有唔同嘅用途嚇，誒嗰塊地咧，最主要咧，佢一定係要提供翻誒一啲誒唔可以超越咗個上限嘅一啲商業元素，同埋而家喺嗰個地嘅設計上咧，佢有啲誒停車位嘅嚇，咁所以咧，佢要整體成個西九咧係。

511
01:41:52,350 --> 01:42:12,360
佢要提供翻咁多嘅停車位，係滿足咗有關部門嘅要求。因為誒好簡單講咧，西九你可以當佢係一個大嘅地方入邊有誒有啲細嘅區咁劃嘅。噉我哋會喺個大嘅地方同埋個細嘅地方咧，會有一啲關於係文化藝術嘅設施啊，誒商業嘅娛。

512
01:42:47,610 --> 01:43:07,620
嗰個改動係都幾頻密嘅，咁所以我就都想睇下，即係發展局會唔會有個即係比較，即係同原先嘅方向已經即係可能我驚最後屘出嚟嘅係越嚟越遠啊，即係走咗樣啊。咁所以會唔會都有一個框架，即係即係起碼唔好同原先嘅諗法。

513
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:02,210
噉你嗰個上蓋嗰度咧？

514
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:15,740
即係幾時出咧？噉。

515
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:57,400
發展，我哋當時時覺得市場可能係會有興趣去一個組合式噉樣樣同嗰個。

516
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:50,470
咁所以大家放心，佢唔會變為一個地產或者商業嘅項目咧，係忘記咗文化藝術嘅一個宗旨嘅。

517
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:23,140
係誒，即係準備成點咧？嗰個三B區嘅上蓋嗰度係啦，主要三個問題。或者我主要誒講咗一個誒。

518
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:12,590
就都係做緊招標㗎嘛，應該係準備緊一啲招標嘅文件啦。個商業嗰度，噉我想問你預計呢啲標書係會幾時？

519
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:22,330
係差太遠咧，我擔心係變咗個全商業嘅，即係誒地點，又並非係推動一啲文化或者表演嘅地方。呢個A.C.E.嗰度，咁所以啱啱都請你嚟答啦。第二就講到停車場嗰度咧，我都想講就係。

520
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:59,770
利用個停車場，跟住去嗰個草地度去去用咧，咁同埋會唔會幫助到周邊個即係停車泊位嘅問題咧？咁所以我都想了解嗰個停車場嗰個即係開放咗之後使用狀況。第三咧就係都係同招標有關，就係。

521
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:42,620
而家其實Empress下面咪有停車場嘅，我知道已經喺二零二零年底已經交咗出嚟畀公眾使用㗎啦。噉我想問，其實嗰個使用率其實而家係點啊？應該應該有啲數據㗎嘛。噉佢喺疫情之下，或者冇一啲即係表演之下，其實係咪都多人？

522
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:43,590
答咗一個關於政府整體規劃，然後再交畀管理局講。誒，阿主席呢方面唔需要擔心，我哋喺個地契條款嗰度咧，亦都有一啲咧係確保管理局作為個法定機構係要毋忘初心嘅。咁所以對於一啲誒誒非文化藝術嘅設施，特別係商業元素咧，其實有個整體發展嘅上限嘅。

523
01:44:51,530 --> 01:45:11,540
多謝啊，秘書長。首先講咗個大前提咧，我哋誒西園土地係畀咗西九咧，但係西九管理局係受制於呢一個嘅誒地契同埋嗰個嘅我哋有一個項目協議。咁當中我哋要滿足到一啲嘅要求，同埋亦都當年二零誒一四年通過嘅，二零一三年通過嘅嗰個發展計劃，即係點？

524
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:31,550
plan咧都規限咗每一塊地咧，大致上佢嗰個用途係乜嘢嘢。如果我哋要改變咧，都有一啲嘅程序要要要進行。咁但係當然呢一刻嚟講咧，我哋仍然希望咧係保留呢一個嘅所謂誒展覽中心用地咧，都係作翻一啲嘅所謂同文化藝術有關嘅一啲嘅誒用途。咁但係是否？

525
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:51,560
都係會展是否係表演場地咧？我哋都仲需要去研究，因為其實大家可能都記得咧，呢個所謂以前係叫做M P V嘅物體咧，都係需要有私人嘅投資，我哋先能夠起嘅。咁所以後嚟我哋做一個市場研究，就係話唔好難去揾到呢一個市場去支持起一個M P V，所以我哋先轉咗做一個會。

526
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:17,820
即U型嗰個個噉嘅發展，加埋呢個誒會展中心咧，可能會有機會咧，係市場會有呢一個嘅興趣嘅。咁但係到而家咧，再睇咧就誒招個標啦，都誒唔成功啦。咁所以可能亦都要再反覆去再研究，將來呢塊土地係點樣樣去用，係用得最好，又唔會違反咗我哋係。

527
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:37,830
喺唔同嘅文件底下做嘅一啲嘅承諾，噉我哋一定有最新嘅結果咧。我哋一定會翻嚟同委員會咧係去報告嘅。呢個亦都係即係對公眾要有一個交代。咁第二咧就係停車場方面咧，就誒M加嘅停車場咧喺十二月三十號咧就誒開咗㗎啦。咁最初市民咧就唔係好知道嗰度有停車位，所以都仍然係。

528
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:57,840
誒有啲係大部分係泊喺藝術公園啦，即係我哋松伊啦，有啲就泊翻喺條路度啦。咁噉，我哋而家都係盡量咧係去誒鼓勵市民啦，係儘量用我哋有多咗呢一百五十幾個嘅停車位。咁據據我啲同事今朝同我講咧，啱啱呢一個週末咧就多咗人係去用呢一個M加嘅停車場。我哋相信咧誒，隨住因為其實。

529
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,060
係嘛？

530
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:32,650
好啊。

531
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,340
係啊，即係進行招標啦。

532
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:44,570
噉啊，我自己就冇太多問題。咁有冇？如果冇嘅話，噉就今日都多謝，謝民政事務局啦、西九嘅同事啦，同埋土木工程拓展署嘅同事嘅。

533
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:09,170
我哋收費都相當廉宜嘅，咁所以咧會隨住我哋即係多啲宣傳咧，應該會多啲人咧係會用呢誒多咗嘅一百五十多個嘅停車位嘅。我都係藉住呢個機會幫手宣傳下嘅。

534
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:29,480
係啦，我哋都希望冇咁多圍嚟泊車嘅。咁第三點咧就招標咧，我哋而家預算咧就誒差唔多，所有嘢都做得七七八八，係做埋嗰個市場嘅所謂誒三點歐exercise咧。我哋就希望第二季今年第二季二零一二年第二季係可以招標嘅，做一個公開招標嘅。明白咁即係第二季就可以即係。
