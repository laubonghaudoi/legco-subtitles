It contains our conclusions and recommendations on Chapter One, on collection and removal of marine refuse by the Marine Department.

17
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,920
The committee urges Marine Department.

18
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,910
and to operate four marine refuse collection points.

委員會建議，作為所有海洋廢物由海洋部門承包商收集後，將會被處置。

24
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:42,400
Of marine refuse collected is reasonably accurate and can truly reflect its performance in tackling marine refuse.

25
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:54,720
to step up the monitoring of the contractor's performance and exercise its right under the contract to impose penalty against the contractor as and when appropriate.

26
00:03:42,720 --> 00:04:00,680
The weight of marine refuse collected, as reported in Marine's Department controlling officers' report, calls was only an estimated based on the number of bags of such refuse collected by the Marine's Department's contractor.

27
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:16,960
In managing its contract for marine refuse cleansing and disposal service, Marine Department has not enforced the penalty provisions under the contract against the contractor for its unauthorised subcontracting arrangements.

28
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:36,070
Furthermore, Marine Department has not, in accordance with the relevant contract provisions, taken any follow-up action in respect of the contractor's failures to perform in marine refuse cleansing work at a number of typhoon shelters and promenades.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:21,010
From two hundred and one two to two hundred and one nine, the overall weight of the municipal solid waste, which includes among others marine refuse disposed of by the marine department contractor at designated disposal facilities, was a meagre nineteen point nine.

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
歐洲。

31
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,670
主席，最近。

32
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,550
委員會 urge。

33
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,010
質詢第一行質詢陳佩然議員。

34
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,140
Building management matters. The committee urges the HAD.

35
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,590
Effort of the Home Affairs Department in facilitating building management.

36
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,070
Failing support. Last but not least, to the staff of the Legislative Chamber. Thank you.

37
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,360
The last subject is relating to the efforts of the HAD in facilitating.

38
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:39,740
Building management, HAD is tasked with assisting owners of private buildings to form owners' corporations and deal with.

39
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:41,160
要更積極，並擔任領先角色，協調相關努力，以迅速且有效，地評估私有建築所有者。

40
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:52,620
Building management matters. However, in its reply to the committee's question regarding the actions initiated by the administration to resolve building safety and fire safety,

41
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:24,650
委員會表達嚴重 concern about HAD lack of initiative in coordinating the efforts of the various departments in providing support services to owners of private building.

42
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:09,490
problems as such on behalf of the owners of private building. HAD advised that since it was not the department in charge of the relevant policy areas and legislation, it did not possess the relevant information.

43
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:52,400
That the environmental bureau has not demonstrated it that it had exerted its best effort to steer the working group towards maximising the collaborative efforts made by member departments in tackling shoreline refuse.

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:58,610
of at the designated disposal facilities, marine department should consider using actual weights of marine refuse disposed of for reporting in its CORs. The committee expresses grave concern about the marine department' ineffective.

45
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:15,800
政府努力在 tackles shoreline refuse， The Environmental Bureau coordinated the establishment of an interdepartmental working group， the working group， to enhance the collaborative efforts among relevant departments in tackling marine refuse.

46
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:35,810
However, no performance target or timetable for improving the cleanliness of shorelines have been set by the working group, and there are some areas along the Hong Kong shorelines which do not fall within the purview of any bureau departments. As such, the committee expresses concern.

47
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:14,900
The Environmental Bureau to set up specific, measurable performance target and timetable for improving shoreline cleanliness, and assign a department to take up the responsibility to ensure the cleanliness of the shoreline areas which do not fall within the purview of any government department.

48
00:08:41,650 --> 00:09:01,660
In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish to record my appreciation on the contribution made by members of the committee. Our gratitude goes to the witnesses who attended the hearing, Health Body Committee. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Director of Audit and his colleague for their.
