第二咧，底線思維咧，就係喺我喺施政理念嗰度咧，我係講咗。

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,250
我亦都喺我嘅誒同不同嘅選委或者公眾誒溝通嘅時候咧，有提及過。

62
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:22,270
啊！呢一啲啊環節上邊，實際我嘅決定應該係點咧？所以喺呢個階段咧，就啊，我唔打算係啊將所有細節咧都公開住。但係無論點咧，最終嘅決定咧，必然會係啊公佈嘅。

63
00:04:45,140 --> 00:05:05,150
政府架構嘅重組嘅方案咧，其實咧已經係做到好細節㗎。咁呢方面咧就有一啲環節咧係我有一啲睇法，咁想聽下行政長官啊佢嘅意見係乜嘅啊？我哋交流咗啦。咁因為我都會係再探討啊。

64
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:28,770
等等嘅不同領域咧，都應該作一個風險評估，誒作出有效嘅預案，確保如果真係有威脅發生嘅時候，我哋能夠誒可以好有信心咁處理嘅。呢個就係底線思維。咁簡單。

65
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,820
係啊！

66
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,600

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,410
同佢哋。

68
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,150
喺昨天我嘅。

69
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,690
當選之後咧，我見記者嘅時候都講咗。

70
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,320
如果喺一個施政部，誒喺一個政綱裏邊。

71
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,380
大家要認認識清楚嚇，噉啊！

72
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,230
就係作最壞嘅打算，而作最好嘅準備。

73
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,510
我嘅政綱裏邊講得好清楚，我嘅施政重點係邊啲方面嘅。

74
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:38,750
違反法律嘅自由，咁所以喺法律容許之下咧，大家係有絕對大嘅自由嘅。呢個咧，我相信咧。

75
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:27,810
言論自由、集會自由等等，基本法裏邊講得好清楚嘅自由，都係喺我哋擁有咗㗎啦。但係呢啲自由唔代表。

76
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:40,050
溝通同埋交流，聽佢哋意見，去進行我其他方面嘅工作嘅。咁所以咧，喺方方面面咧，我嘅工作咧都會好認真咁展開嘅。

77
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:06,970
誒，起碼係有篇幅上面嘅限制咧，我都解釋過，唔會每一個環節咧都會去提及嘅，唔提及嘅亦都唔表示我唔關注嘅。

78
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:26,810
我開展嘅工作咧，包括會去全力去落實我政工嘅工作，亦都同時講明，我會繼續接觸不同嘅人士或者去地區。

79
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:54,810
係咪你嘅當選宣言咧都冇提到言論自由啊、新聞自由啲核心價值？你認為係咪已經有咗，所以唔需要捍衞？你會承諾，你嘅任內呢一啲嘅自由都係不會改變。同埋你下晝去中聯辦，誒係咪一個借票嘅行程咧？你認為你攞到四票係你自己爭取嘅努力，定係有中聯辦幫你拉票咧？

80
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:16,600
香港嘅自由同埋權利咧，喺基本法裏邊充分寫曬出嚟，兼且保障咗㗎啦。就等於我答大家新聞自由，其實係我哋已經擁有咗㗎啦，已經喺我哋袋裏邊㗎啦。所以香港嘅。

81
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,630
subject。

82
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,270
also。

83
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,140
對，wrong。

84
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,270
啊！ violate。

85
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,360
against。

86
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,950
the month.

87
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,820
啊，That.

88
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,130
呢套現在我。

89
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,180
一 lot of you.

90
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,310
所以那點 has to be very clear.

91
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,890
我聽我聽聽英文嗰個問題啦，唔該。

92
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,140
first of all, I think in

93
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,130
我conducted my election campaign.

94
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,710
them their action are contravening the law. It is their action.

95
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,950
people are brought to court because of the suspicion.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:32,490
Let me answer your first first. Okay, I think you are very wrong to describe that people are now charged simply because of their expressed opinions. That is absolutely wrong, and it should not be so described. It is misleading, and actually and factual.

97
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,590
嗯。

98
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,030
Districts.

99
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,780
meet people.

100
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,050
were with me。

101
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,910

103
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,370
啊，campaign。

104
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,000
philosophy of governance。

105
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,430
when I went to.

106
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
to various people.

107
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,650
went to.

108
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,260
of the election.

109
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,020
所以我 make my effort in the whole month.

110
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,460
或conduct face-to-face or online meetings.

111
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,990
and I remember that on one day I went around to ten places.

112
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:15,030
And a lot of your colleagues were with me, and they actually said that well, they had a long day.

113
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,720
and。

114
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,830
and I hope.

115
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,540
to try to explain.

116
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,230
to again explain my.

117
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,960
所以，我 make 很多努力。

118
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,730
how?

119
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,030
到社會。

120
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,680
and I also did a lot of online meetings with.

121
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,110
I hope you will also reflect.

122
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,680
and win the support of the people I met.

123
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,300
and the achievements that I want to be realised.

124
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,070
我 intent， the sixth government will bring。

125
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,110
and my colleagues in the campaign office also made a lot of efforts.

126
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,600
representatives of different sectors, particularly members of election committee.

127
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:30,170
when people saw all these activities and the work that we conducted tirelessly every day, then

128
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:53,930
philosophy of governance, my intention of how if I get elected, then the sixth term government would do.

129
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,110
被枉。

130
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,720
of chaos.

131
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,880
因為。

132
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,710
The election was conducted.

133
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,660
我唔同意，and I think they.

134
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,750
with a high degree of foreign intervention.

135
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,420
internal wastage。

136
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,000
所以，係我嘅個人嘅努力。

137
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,100
and of course I thank for the opportunities that the public has given me.

138
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,710
And the last thing about the comments made by the EU.

139
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:39,060
enacted because of what happened in the years.

140
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,600
and also attempts to sabotage Hong Kong governance.

141
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,950
and I'm of course very grateful to members of the election committee who voted for me.

142
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:09,040
After hearing what my intention and purposes would be in the sixth term government.

143
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:32,330
According to the election law in Hong Kong, and the election law in Hong Kong was.

144
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:43,790
this activities to people of Hong Kong so that they actually saw how hard I work and how hard my colleagues work together with me.

145
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,410
啊！

146
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,220
In。

148
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,650
off。

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,280
which we have now.

150
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,570
A lot of debates.

151
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,930
There is broad representation.

152
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,960
The two to three years leading.

153
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,320
Improving the electoral system.

154
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,570
所以，它已經已經創造。

155
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,760
到的 situation， that resulted。

156
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,060
It is an improved system in which.

157
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,260
所以它 was against this background, which.

158
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,380
positive results，as you can see，that in electrical

159
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,920
people saw and experienced during.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,220
interest， and also， is in accordance with the actual situation of Hong Kong。

161
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,970
and。

162
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,580
